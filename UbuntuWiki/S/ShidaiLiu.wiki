I have been using Debian Linux since November 2002. I love this distribution and I have installed Debian Linux in my group as a platform for network simulation. But as a desktop, Debian is a bit outdated and conservative compared to SUSE and Mandriva. This is where Ubuntu fits in. I'd like to see Ubuntu getting better and better both in PC and Laptops, and stay No. 1 in Distrowatch ranking.

Currently I'm an engineering Ph.D. student at Cambridge University, a place with a strong connection to the open source community.
