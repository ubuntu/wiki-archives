=== Summary ===

Qt Mobility is an API that means to abstract from middleware for typical Mobile use cases and as such currently (as of 1.0.0) covers the following areas:
* Service Framework
* Bearer Management
* Messaging
* Contacts
* Versit
* Publish and Subscribe
* Location
* System Information
* Sensors

It's a frontend API that allows to plug in backends for devices and middleware; the package itself does not ship any backends.

=== Design ===

Make the Qt mobility API available in the archive, decide which of the available backends to package and make those available in the archive too; choose at least one application that uses the mobility APIs to clean the efforts.

=== Implementation ===
* package up qt mobility; here we need to coordinate with packaging best practices of the Kubuntu team
* investigate available backends and decide which one to make available
* investigate if there are already apps available that make use of the mobility APIs (or part of it) and make those available in a PPA or archive
* ensure that qt mobility APIs are used on at least one test/UI head provided by Linaro User Platforms Team (see UbuntuSpec:arm-m-ui-and-test-heads)
