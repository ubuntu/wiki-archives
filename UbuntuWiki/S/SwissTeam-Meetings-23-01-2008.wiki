__TOC__

As usual now, people who volunteered for some item are marked in parenthesis () next to it.

== General community stuff: ==

* Next IRC meeting for the release parties: 5.2.
* Mamarok has a nice tatoo :) (digg frontpage!)
** <nowiki>[[http://mark.kollide.net/dscn4229.jpg|Picture]]</nowiki>
* Should we consider IRC moderation for meetings? In order to keep them short and focused?

== Release party specifics: ==

* Paid advertisement
** Costs are too high
** Possible to write a press release instead
** Someone should write a generic "press release" in German and French that we can use to spam newspapers and other groups
** Newspapers to contact:
** Tagesanzeiger
** Matin bleu
** 20minutes (french/swissgerman) (Netztier)
** Maybe "technology" sections of other newspapers?
** Should check with students newspapers (EPFL, ETHZ, various schools)
* Location (to be confirmed):
** '''Lausanne (17.05)''' : Epfl (WaVeR)
** Contacts underway. Could provide room / switches / beamer. 
** We might need voice amplification devices if there are really many people :)
** Need a "responsible person of contact" (Tribaal if needed)
** Should make a "dossier" - wikifaeries, please make this wiki beautiful so we can use it!
*** What is the number of people expected
*** What activities
** '''Zurich (24.05)''': Vortrags-Saal of the ZHdK (Netztier)
* Contacts:
** gnugeneration.epfl.ch
** gull
* CDs ordering (Mamarok)
** Need more Kubuntu this year (obscure market share reasons :) )
** /ch/open Swiss remix CDs

== Tribaal's footnote: ==

* We should consider getting united t-shirts, something like "Ubuntu-ch" -with our username-
** Sticks out of the crowd. Organising team should be easy to spot if needed.
** Looks cool ;)
** Printing a t-shirt costs around 40CHF print inc. shipping.
** We need a design (obviously) that sticks out of the croud (there might be other ubuntu t-shirts around)
