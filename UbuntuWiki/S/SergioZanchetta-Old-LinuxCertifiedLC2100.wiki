* Model: LC2100
* Website: http://www.linuxcertified.com/

=== Current Issues ===
* (6/11/06) Installed Ubuntu 6.06 and it works perfectly.
* (5/7/06) Dapper Drake 6.06 Beta2 (27-Apr-2006) install failed.
** 1st attempt: I upgraded from Breezy 5.10 to Dapper Beta via Synaptics.  After update I rebooted.  The boot splash screen appeared functional for a while and then the screen went black (backlight remained on).  Symptoms are similar to those caused by Network Manager problem in Breezy 5.10.
** 2nd attempt: The Dapper Beta2 i386 livecd (27-Apr-2006) brings up the boot option menu without a hitch.  After selecting the livecd option, boot proceeds correctly for a while and then the same display crash occurs.
* No hibernate or sleep in Breezy 5.10
* (4/10/06) Under Breezy 5.10 installing Network Manager causes serious crash followed by boot failure which only can be resolved by booting into recovery mode and executing 'apt-get remove network-manager'
