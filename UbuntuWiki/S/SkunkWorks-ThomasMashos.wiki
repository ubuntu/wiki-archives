''List any other work that you have done that you think makes you an ideal candidate for participating in a SkunkWorks project''

I'm one of the main Mythbuntu developers. Along with coordinating releases with upstream developers, I've also written various applications for Mythbuntu and Ubuntu TV. I've picked up things that have been abandoned (Mythbuntu theme), given demos and received feedback at release parties, assisted people in real life, IRC, forums, done weekly updates for the Ubuntu TV project, grown the Mythbuntu Google+ followers and frequently contribute to the page.
