I just would like to add what I have done for the Ubuntu Community. 
I am a Professor in Virginia at a local college, my specialization is Security Auditing and Intrusion Detection. My students are required to use Ubuntu as part of my program. I have used many a Linux Distro starting with my first Caldera's OpenLinux eDesktop 2.4 if that gives  the readers an idea of how long I have actuallly used it. After experimenting with multiple distros for my students and for my self I choose Ubuntu for the ease of use and the fact that it does exactly what I ask of it. I have organized a distrubtion point in our library for giving away the Ubuntu CDs. Within the first 2 days all 50 cds were gone and students where asking for more. So as the shipments come they are placed in circulation for the students.
As of September 16th, 2005 The college I work for has distributed over 400 Ubuntu CDs. We are working on 1000 before January 1st.
