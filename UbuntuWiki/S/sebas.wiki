__TOC__

I'm working on guidance, the set of system administration tools in Kubuntu. I'm also active within KDE, where I'm on the KDE e.V. Board to represent KDE in legal and official matters, and also do administrative tasks. I've represented the Kubuntu team at the conferences in Paris and Mountainview, where I'm trying to push Kubuntu forward and improve collaboration and communication between Kubuntu and other Ubuntu subprojects.
