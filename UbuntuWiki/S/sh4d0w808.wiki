==== About me: ====
I was born 35 years ago. I met computers so early and this lead me to graduate as a programmer. I saw "my" first Linux system in 1996, it was a Debian-system. I've met Ubuntu in 2007, this caused me to join to Hungarian Translate Team of Full Circle Magazine. I like the world of open source, so trying to use only these kind of programs under Windows also.
I propagate the spirit of open source at my worldwide IT company.

==== Testimonials: ====

Szapper Balázs (blaselinux): I am in daily contact with László and he is always helpful in any kind of problem. His descriptions help a lot in the setting of my system. In the translating team, makes most useful work though.

Királyvári Gábor (kiri): László presents a great contribution in the Hungarian translation team of Full Circle Magazine with such activities like translating, veting, correcting articles and improves team activities with his own ideas.
