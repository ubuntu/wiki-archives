== Google Summer of Code: Information for mentors ==

Prospective mentors should be active developers who have been able to make a useful and sustained contribution to Ubuntu, and have demonstrated an ability to lead the community in further development of the distribution.

You'll be responsible for answering any questions the selected students have, and help them to settle into the community for the duration of the SoC. You will also be responsible for providing feedback to Google, the Student and Ubuntu on the project progress, as well as evaluating the project at the end of the programme.

For your time and trouble you will receive a cool limited edition t-shirt and other goodies!
