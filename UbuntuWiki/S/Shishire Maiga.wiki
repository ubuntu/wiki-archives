== About Me ==
=== Abstract ===
I'm primarily a PHP developer in Boston, MA (GMT -5).
I'm fluent in PHP, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Lua.
I have decent (getting better every day) knowledge of C, C++, and various other languages like Java, Python, Objective-C, etc.
I have readable knowledge of most modern languages, although it will take me much longer than normal, as I have to look things up as I go.

I'm primarily interested in just about everything.  Mostly I think about what I use/come across in my everyday development cycle.  That includes IDEs, libraries, network tools, compilers, servers of all shapes and sizes (the programs, not the hardware), transmission protocols, screensavers, version control software, etc.

* Ubuntu
* VLC
* MPlayer
* Mencoder
* Tilda

=== Triage Availability ===
I can usually spend 5~10 hours a week doing triage, more on unusual occasions (like vacation) or if a certain bugfix is crucial to my development ("I can't continue working, it's broken upstream!"), or has sparked my interest.
