=== Current Issues ===

Fn keys take a lot of work and driver breaks with each new kernel.  Modem largely untested, but is not detected by Restricted Drivers Manager.
Suspend and hibernate work, but take a long time to recover and are not 100% reliable - I'd guess 85% reliability.  As yet I haven't discovered which factors affect this.
