__TOC__

I've been using Ubuntu on desktops and laptops since 2005 and programming for quite awhile.  I'm hoping to become more involved in the Ubuntu project as a developer.

I'm open to working in any area as a part of bugsquad, but I am most interested in working on Kernel bugs.  I'm the EST time zone of the U.S. (New York time) and I can commit to triaging bugs a few hours per week.
