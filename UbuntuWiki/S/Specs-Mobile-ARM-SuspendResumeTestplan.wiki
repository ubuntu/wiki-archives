300 consecutive suspend/resume
uses wake alarm scripts  RTC wakeup
   http://kernel.ubuntu.com/git?p=cking/scripts/.git;a=summary

Works for freescale, works for marvell

How can you make sure that every driver has reinitialized properly on resume?
* something has to be done on each resume to test them all
* could add a lot of manual tests to do this
* existing test scripts do not currently cover this
* drivers have to be checked after suspend/resume and hibernate 
        - memory / ECC
        - suspend resume during media playback (audio/video)
        - v4L
        - network could be checked with ping
        - graphics will need manual look
                - xrandr
                - second display
                - disconnect display
        - usb / USB OTG
                remove card during sleep (manual test)
        - Bluetooth adapters + devices
        - connectable buses - PCI-express, PCMCIA, eSATA
        - audio tests?  state can be saved and compared
        - manjo will cover these cases
        - network file systems 
        - network block (iSCSI and ata over ethernet)
        - ext2/3/4 fs
        - raw MLC NAND and UBIFS is likely to be used considering its low price
        - sd card test / SDIO
                remove card during sleep
        - HID devices
                - mouse
                - accelerometers
                - touchscreen
                - electrostatic button bars (persia)
                - fingerprint readers / authentication devices
        - cpufreq / voltage resume to previous state / full function
                - backlight
                - fan / cooling
                - sensors?  (may not be right place)
        - include multicore (for future)
        - OEM GPIO/etc?
                - soft switches for wireless control
                - soft switches / keys for keyboard media functions
        - Encryption Engines
        - Mobile / Telephony devices - Liquid on Lucid
        
Discussion about the implications of suspend/resume on local media playback
        - expected to resume where it left off after resume
        - it is possible using known power management hooks to prevent sleep or ConsoleKit to pause media before suspend and play media after resume

ACTIONS:
 Identify what of the ones above can be tested automatically
 Gather input from QA/OEM team about what is already done
 Identify what parts can be added to checkbox
 Identify what parts are really special to mobile
 Ensure that things that are not mobile specific are getting done too (not
 necessarily by mobile team).
 Check what is different for hibernation (compared to suspend)

Two QA leads, people will have to volunteer to test some of these subsystems
Write up test cases so that volunteers can run them
Write up automated test cases - QA
