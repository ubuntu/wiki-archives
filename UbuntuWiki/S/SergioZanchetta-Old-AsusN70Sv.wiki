==== Notes on Hardware Details ====

# 3D Acceleration works with proprietary nvidia drivers
# Extended desktop works in Twin View only, with nvidia drivers.  Untested with Ubuntu proprietary drivers
# Sleeping/Hibernation issues
    a. Upon either hibernation or suspension the laptop's backlight turned off, when resuming the backlight would not turn back on despite reboots.  The only solution was to reset the bios (turn computer off, unplug, remove battery pack, press and hold the power key for 15 seconds, put computer back together and start as normal).
    a. Upon suspend the laptops backlight was dimmed, and did not return to the proper setting when resuming.  The fix was to just do a Fn+F6 until it reached it's original brightness.  The above mentioned issue in &#91;<nowiki>[[#3a|3a]]</nowiki>&#93; did not seem to occur however.
# Sound did not work by default.  It was necessary to add to the end of the file ''/etc/modprob.d/alsa-base.conf'' <code>options snd-hda-intel model=3stack-dig</code>
# In actuallity there is really no hardware switch, but there are keyboard combinations that do work.
# The internal wireless card causes the entire system to lock up whenever enabled.  Sometimes immediately and other times it is at random.
# PCI Express cards
    a. Only tested with a Belkin Gigabit Ethernet ExpressCard for Wired Internet Connection.  Used to supplement the wired card that doesn't work.

 1. Web Camera
    a. Camera is mounted upside-down and drivers do not have an option to flip the image.  Had to use <nowiki>[[http://radu.cotescu.com/2009/07/31/resolving-vertically-flipped-images-from-webcams-in-ubuntu/|this script]]</nowiki> to flip the camera.

==== Notes on keys ====
# Only works properly if you follow <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1049170#8|the instructions located here]]</nowiki>.
# The splendid switch seems to be calling the touchpad toggle key event, so one can actually toggle the touchpad off/on by using the splendid switch.  The touchpad toggle key does nothing and does not generate a key event.
# Must configure these options from "System -> Preferences -> Mouse | Touchpad"
# Had to follow the instructions <nowiki>[[http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~jnjackin/docs/two_finger_scrolling-linux.html|location here]]</nowiki> and configure the option in "System -> Preferences -> Mouse | Touchpad."  The option works for the most part, but seems to be quirky in that it doesn't always seem to act the way I think it would.  Perhaps it is me?
# Sends the correct keycode but does not do as the manufacturer describes (due to the sofware not being available in Ubuntu).
# Num LK randomly stopped working for toggling whilst Ubuntu was running for some reason.  The solution to get it working again was to do an "Alt+Shift+Num LK" one time.
