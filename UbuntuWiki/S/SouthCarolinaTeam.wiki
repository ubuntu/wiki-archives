=== Introduction ===
* Welcome to the Ubuntu South Carolina LoCo Team Wiki page. We are a volunteer organization within the State of South Carolina who are committed to education with the goal of an increase in general awareness of Ubuntu and Open Source. Our Community Projects are geared so that we return more to the community than we receive, and we always endeavor to live up to the <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/community/conduct/|Ubuntu Code of Conduct]]</nowiki>. Please review the header of this page; it has quantities of useful information.

=== Team Goals ===

* As stated in the introduction above, our goals are to help spread Ubuntu and Open Source. We will implement team and community service projects as needed to achieve these goals.

While working toward this goal, we will continue to educate the public on the advantages of Ubuntu and Open Source.
