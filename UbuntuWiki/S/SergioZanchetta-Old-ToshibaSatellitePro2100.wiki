=== Current Issues ===
With Hoary, no problem.
Breezy don't support scroll down of touchpad with version 0.13.6 of xorg-driver-synaptics.
I compile a new version with sources 0.14.3.
I can now scroll up and down with right up corner of touchpad but for the moment scroll button don't work. I have to test to fix that.
In Dapper, synaptics drivers work. I have to put some options like in Breezy for all.
I solved Nvidia driver problem with this step that I find here <nowiki>[[http://doc.gwos.org/index.php/Latest_Nvidia_Dapper|Nvidia]]</nowiki> 
If you own a GeForce4 420 Go you should follow these steps: 
sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/options
* Add this option at the end of the file: 
* options nvidia NVreg_SoftEDIDs=0 NVreg_Mobile=1
* CTRL+O to save CTRL+X to exit 
* Edit your xorg.conf: 
* sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
* get to the "Section Device" and add the following options 
* Option 		"RenderAccel" 		"true"
* Option 		"AllowGLXWithComposite" "true" 
* Option		"IgnoreEDID"		"true"
* Option		"IgnoreEdidFreqs"	"true"
* Option		"GenerateRTList"	"0"
* Option		"OverridePolarity"	"1"
