== Charm Use: OpenStack Origin ==

The majority of !OpenStack charms support the configuration option 'openstack-origin'. This option allows the charm to source various different releases of !OpenStack from the Ubuntu distribution, the Ubuntu Cloud Archive and from various other sources.

=== Ubuntu ===

To use the version of !OpenStack that shipped as part of an Ubuntu release, simple set:

<pre>
openstack-origin: distro
</pre>

This format also supports testing of charms with versions of !OpenStack in the SRU process:

<pre>
openstack-origin: distro-proposed
</pre>

As a reference, here are the mappings between !OpenStack release and Ubuntu release:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| '''Ubuntu Release'''
| '''Ubuntu Codename'''
| '''!OpenStack Release'''
|-
| 12.04
| Precise
| Essex
|-
| 14.04
| Trusty
| Icehouse
|-
| 15.04

=== Ubuntu Cloud Archive ===

The Ubuntu Cloud Archive provides backports of !OpenStack releases to Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

==== Ubuntu 16.04 ====

Supported values for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS include:

<pre>
openstack-origin: cloud:xenial-newton
openstack-origin: cloud:xenial-ocata
openstack-origin: cloud:xenial-pike
</pre>

Again, proposed updates in the stable release update process may also be tested:

<pre>
openstack-origin: cloud:xenial-newton/proposed
openstack-origin: cloud:xenial-ocata/proposed
openstack-origin: cloud:xenial-pike/proposed
</pre>

==== Ubuntu 14.04 ====

Supported values for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS include:

<pre>
openstack-origin: cloud:trusty-mitaka
openstack-origin: cloud:trusty-kilo
</pre>

Again, proposed updates in the stable release update process may also be tested:

<pre>
openstack-origin: cloud:trusty-mitaka/proposed
openstack-origin: cloud:trusty-kilo/proposed
</pre>

==== Ubuntu 12.04 ====

Supported values for Ubuntu 12.04 LTS include:

<pre>
openstack-origin: cloud:precise-icehouse
</pre>

Again, proposed updates in the stable release update process may also be tested:

<pre>
openstack-origin: cloud:precise-icehouse/proposed
</pre>

=== Using PPA's ===

The openstack-origin option also supports use of PPA's, however the name of the PPA must include the release codename of the !OpenStack release it contains, for example:

<pre>
openstack-origin: ppa:james-page/liberty-testing
</pre>

=== Using 'deb...' source entries ===

The openstack-origin option also supports direct entry of 'deb...' source entries, with an optional GPG key for authentication of packages, for example:

<pre>
openstack-origin: "deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/james-page/liberty-testing/ubuntu trusty main|448413DC"
</pre>

The above example manual configures the sources file with the equivalent of the example given for PPA's.  Again the provided value must contain the release of !OpenStack that the archive contains.
