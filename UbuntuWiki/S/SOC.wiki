__TOC__

I am SOC, who is a Taiwanese. This is not the first time that I use Linux. I use it as a desktop. The distributions I used  before were Mandrake, Fedora Core, Debian. When I used ubuntu, I like it immediately and think I will use it for a long long Time. I try to translate things about ubuntu and hope the tomorrow of open sources will become better.

I like playing guitar and listening to music. I like rock, raggae, funk, jazz. I try to become a better guitar player though I am not a good player now.

If you are interested in me, I have a blog(in Chinese of course). You can read some articles I wrote there. http://www.wretch.cc/blog/SOC .
