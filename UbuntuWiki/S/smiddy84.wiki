__TOC__

Currently I finish my master in mechanical engineering in Zurich, Switzerland.

I am using ubuntu flavors since 2 years and now want to give back a little bit expertise to the projects which is from my point of view very important: Lubuntu and Xubuntu

In my freetime I convince friends to install lubuntu on their netbooks. With quite satisfying results...

Current Work
QA and testing for xubuntu and lubuntu.
