| Member drive: For example, if you are on a campus or member of a LUG, is there an active interest in being a part of a state-wide team? Even virtually Discussion topic.

| Proposal to amend member Charter or re-word about what an "active member" is (just considering the factor of IRC, attendance at meetings etc.) Would like ideas surrounding what an "active member" should encompass. I.E. Active on a team. JCSteele = active member (web site). Myrtlebeachbums = active member (look at all the work he has done). Things of this nature. Wording of Charter rests in the hands of the members. We need to take a vote to amend it/re-word it, then take it to the forums.
|-
| Craig
| xq
| Database of LUGs/other Linux groups. We need to start forming a database of contacts of other groups in South Carolina and their leader(s). This will help us in the end, for example with the launch party. But in the end it will have a much larger defined goal. We need contacts and it all starts with you!
