==== Notes ====
Installation lockup might happens on gparted screen (partitioning step). It is probably due  to the physical memory's low space. I solve this issue by creating swap partition first and running gparted before the installation.
To use video hardware acceleration and usb devices at the same time, add "noapic" in boot command line. If the ethernet interface doesn't work with "noapic", also add "irqpoll".

EDIT-- No need to pass some command-line to the boot command anymore since gutsy.
Keymapping pretty much the same from dapper to gutsy.
Gutsy's alsa is still buggy. Future updates may fix the problems.
