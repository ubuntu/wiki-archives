Ubuntu-eu seems to just be for the clusters, language barrier seemed the main thing.

Ubuntu-us seems a good base, but struggle with the marketing, hanging around on there.

Spoke to Duane from LP FG and going to work together to help with the producing of material for LP classes.Also mentioned screencasts which will be ideal further down line as resource.
