__TOC__

My name is Jean-Paul, and I am a Computer Science student at UWO in South Western Ontario, Canada. I have not declared a major yet, but will probably end up doing CS and Psychology. I program in C, C++, Java, and Sparc asm. I run a Diaspora node alongside Drupal on a webserver at my home. I have been running for approximately 5 years, although not always the same site.
