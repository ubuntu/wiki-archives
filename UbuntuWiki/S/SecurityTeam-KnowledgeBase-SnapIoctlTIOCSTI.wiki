== ioctl(..., TIOCSTI, ...) seccomp filter bypass ==
The snapd default seccomp filter for strict mode snaps blocks the use of the ioctl() system call when used with TIOCSTI as the second argument to the system call. Jann Horn discovered that this restriction could be
circumvented on 64 bit architectures on systems with snapd before 2.37.4. A malicious snap could exploit this
to bypass intended access restrictions to insert characters into the terminal's input queue.

All Ubuntu systems with snaps installed will automatically refresh the core snap and relaunch snapd from the updated core snap. 2.37.4 snaps were released to the stable channel on 2019-03-12 and therefore all Ubuntu systems with snaps installed will typically have upgraded to the fixed snapd 2.37.4 by the time this issue went public.
