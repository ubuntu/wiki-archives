Hi, My name is '''Sundeep & I'm from India'''. I'm new to the terms of Linux and Open system architecture. I'm very much '''interested in learning about Linux, its administration and its architecture'''. I would be much obliged, if anyone can guide me through the intricacies of the same. '''Please drop in a note''' if you feel that you can help me or use me in any of your ventures. My mail ID would be '''dudesnep@gmail.com'''.
