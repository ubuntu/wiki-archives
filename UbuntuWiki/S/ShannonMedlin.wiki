==== Notes ====

Running Ubuntu since Edgy, (original try-out dual-boot w/ XP on Gateway M275 Tablet PC). Now have this new box just running Ubuntu, have laptop back just on XP.  I usually keep my Laptop stowed away and access it from my Ubuntu box via Remote Desktop.
Have WoW installed and working in wine.  Not messing with trying to Get Quicken working in wine right now.  Still find websites that work better on XP box, etc.  Plus I have a Treo 700wx (with Windows Mobile Smartphone edition on it and playing with Visual Studio Express).

I am able to logon to Citrix for working remotely without issue and use my linux box primarily.

Still need to test out bluetooth compatibility in linux.  For example, can I hook up a bluetooth stereo headset and use it for WoW? hmmm... :)

I have VMWare installed with another XP install and plan on playing around with Virtual Box to create test environments.  Example: I am considering on purchasing a Linux NSlu2 "slug" and want to try out the ubuntu distro for it.  I want to see if it can be used as a DVR, or just storage.
