==== Notes ====
1. If booted with external monitor On, LCD is disabled rather than mirrored. Pressing Fn-F4 does not switch between LCD and external once X starts; during booting it works as expected. If booted with external monitor off, it gets no signal when turned on.
2. Sleep didn't at first appear on the Log Out menu. Editing /etc/default/acpi-default put it on the menu, but although it does sleep, it reboots on restart. Hibernate does shutdown but hangs on restart.
3. Tried irdadump but no packets seen.
4. Sleep puts the machine to sleep, but on return from sleep it just flashes its LEDs and locks up.
5. Hibernate worked in Flight 3 if called directly as /etc/acpi/hibernate.sh. Networking and sound come back; USB devices must be unplugged and replugged. Bugs: screensaver doesn't start and Power Management options tab has no effect - lid close and Shut Down... menu always call sleep.
6. In Flight 5, hibernate fails even to stop correctly - machine left hanging with display blank.
