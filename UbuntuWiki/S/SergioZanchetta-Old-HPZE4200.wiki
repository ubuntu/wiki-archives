=== Current Issues ===

On Breasy had to disable unloading of USB related modules in order to have USB working after resume from hibernate.
in /etc/defaults/acpi-support had to make the following change:
MODULES_WHITELIST="usbhid ohci_hcd usbcore"

On Dapper Flight 5, USB works after resume from hibernate without the above modification.
