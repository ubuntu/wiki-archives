==== Notes ====
===== Sound =====
* Must add '''options snd-hda-intel model=hp''' on /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf to make sound switch work.

===== Sleep =====
* Out of the box: The screen doesn't wake up after laptop has gone to sleep
* Using Propritary Video Driver: Problem doesn't exist

===== Thermal Sensors =====
* Not Out of the box
* Must install lm-sensors, than execute sensors-detect to generate the commands needed to load the required modules 

===== Wacom/Touch screen =====
* Not Out of the box
* Download the file: http://launchpadlibrarian.net/34450236/10-linuxwacom.fdi , and paste in into /usr/share/hal/fdi/policy/20thirdparty/10-linuxwacom.fdi , then reboot. Should bring up Touch in addition to Stylus and Eraser. (May need calibrating, with "wacomcpl" of the wacom-tools package. The configuration-details will be saved in $HOME/.xinitrc , and can then be copied into the appropriate section in /usr/share/hal/fdi/policy/20thirdparty/10-linuxwacom.fdi ).

===== Rotate screen =====
* Not Out of the box
* See this  guide for <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=996830|How to Rotate the screen]]</nowiki>. I just did what is on '''Appendix 1''': Add ''Option "RandRRotation"  "on"'' on the ''Section "Device"'' in xorg.conf. Then the commands ''xrandr -o left'' will work. After that, I installed a ''wacomrotate daemon'' on my system, so that it would flip the orientation on the stylus, eraser and touch automatically to match the screen orientation. See the first post on the guide, '''Method 3''', on how to do it.

===== Automatic Rotation =====
* Not Out of the box
* See this guide <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=7738673&postcount=225| for how to automatically rotate the screen to portrait mode when turning the hinge]]</nowiki>, and folding the screen down on the Tablet PC. No need to do the 'hp_wmi'-compiling if on Karmic. Just insert "hp_wmi" in /etc/modules , copy the script''(Attention to changes for karmic)'' into $HOME/.automagic_rotation and insert it into "Startup Applications" (You may want to edit the script a bit... read the full post). Reboot!

===== Scroll Lock and SysRq =====
* Scroll Lock tested on virtual console.
* MagicSysRq was disable. I had to add kernel.sysrq = 1 on /etc/sysctl.conf
* SysRq recognized as "Print Screen" on X. On virtual console works ok.
