Hello wiki! :)

<nowiki>[[http://ups.openrealms.com/imgs/ups.jpg|{{http://ups.openrealms.com/imgs/ups_thumb.png}}]]</nowiki>

My name is Steven Andries.
I've been using ''linux'' since 2004, and have been using '''Ubuntu Linux''' {*} since BreezyBadger.

Besides this page being a profile, I'll use this page for testing some of the functions of the Ubuntu wiki.

I'm experienced in web development and I'm a novice in application development. I'm also a strong believer of Open Source and commit myself to encourage others in using Open Source.
