===== Setting Up The Tools =====

* Irc
*** What is IRC?
*** IRC stands for, "Internet Relay Chat". There are many different servers which have channels (similar to chat rooms) which are used for chatting and meetings depending on who exactly uses the channel itself. Most teams you see concerning Ubuntu will use the Freenode network over the IRC.
*** How do you connect
*** To connect to an IRC network first you will need an instant messaging or chat program that can use the IRC network. Xchat, Pidgin, and Empathy are examples of that type of chat program. The most commonly used one in my opinion is Xchat. As Xchat does not come pre-installed you will need to install it before connecting to the IRC network. To install go to Applications -> Add/Remove Applications. In the Add/Remove Applications window choose the Internet section. In the search box type, Xchat. Choose the one titled just Xchat. Do not choose the one titled Xchat Gnome as is comes with less options and configuration capabilities. After installing the program open it. The default configuration will have the network list open automatically. Scroll down until you see the network titled "Freenode". Click on it and then choose "Edit" directly to the right.
