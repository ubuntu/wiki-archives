=== Current Issues ===
* Version with Broadcom wireless NIC only works with selfcompiled ndiswrapper
* Battery only gets properly updated randomly (needs reboot etc.) - need to get more information, seems to be a problem with firmware (which is probably modified for fast windows boot), as BIOS startup takes quite long if last OS was a Linux
* Xorg 7.0 intel driver is having color issues with videos (probably only applies for xv)
* CPU scaling is not available (if you put the indicator on Gnome taskbar you get an error message and it sticks to 1,46 Ghz)
* Sleep doesn't work (when it wakes up, on the textual consolles you see only various green vertical bars, and on the graphical one you only see the mouse - and it doesn't move)
