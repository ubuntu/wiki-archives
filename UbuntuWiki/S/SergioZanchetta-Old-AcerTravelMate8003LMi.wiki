==== Notes ====

* "*1" still testing some things :-)
* "*2" Had to set most keys manual in Gnome Keybaord Shortcuts
* "*3" No code when trying to use this key in Gnome Keyboard Shortcuts
* "*4" Numbers only work when shift is pressed too, don't think that's normal?
* "*5" (smart)Cardreader is an O2micro OZ711M3 chip. They provide a Linux 2.4 binary driver (on request only?) and told me in a mail that they consider to open source it in the future for kernel 2.6. Maybe things go faster when some Ubuntu devs contact them an ask. :-)
