=== Current Issues ===

* I'm having problems with the '''xserver''' in Breezy, that I haven't had in Hoary !

 When I switch to the console using Ctrl-Alt-F1 and then back to X via Ctrl-Alt-F7 the xserver crashes and restarts so I end up at the login screen again. This is of course not only annoying when using the console, but I also can't use suspend to disk because of this. I filed a bug report (<nowiki>[[http://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/show_bug.cgi?id=17698|Bug #17698]]</nowiki>), but haven't got any response yet. 

 Oh, the problem does '''not''' occur when using the breezy live-cd.

* Another less annoying problem is regarding the execution order of init scripts: '''wpasupplicant''' is started '''after''' ntp-date, causing ntp-date to wait until I press Ctrl-C, since the network isn't available at that point. I hope this will be fixed, although wpasupplicant is in universe (<nowiki>[[http://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/show_bug.cgi?id=16551|Bug #16551]]</nowiki>)
