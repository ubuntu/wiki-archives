=== Creating LDAP Clients ===

There are two main steps to making any Linux box into an LDAP client:

## Mount /home via NFS
##### Make sure your home directories are exported from your fileserver (which may be your Samba/LDAP server); see /etc/exports on that server and you should have something like the following:

                     <pre>
/home        192.168.0.0/255.255.0.0(rw,sync)
</pre>
                     

                  "192.168.0.0/255.255.0.0" represents the network which you want to allow to mount /home. 

         2. Add a line to /etc/fstab on your LDAP client to mount /home remotely. It should look something like this:

                     <pre>
fileserver-ip-addr:/home        /home        nfs        defaults        0        0
</pre>
                     

                  Make sure the portmap service is installed and running (on [Ed]Ubuntu, you must also install nfs-common), and execute the following command:

                 <pre>
$ mount -a
</pre>
                     

   2. Run $ ./smbldap ldapclient and answer the questions. You'll need to reboot (or 'init 1' if you know how to do that) before you can authenticate to the LDAP server.
