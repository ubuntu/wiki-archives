==== What needs to be configured ====
* ATI Mobility Radeon X1400 (128 MB) (1)
* The live CD doesn't work out-of-the-box; but you can make it work (8)

==== Current annoyances ====
* I hope you can live without suspend and hibernate - due to a bug in ATI's fglrx video driver, neither work. (9)

==== What needs to be configured ====
* ATI Mobility Radeon X1400 (128 MB) (1)
* IrDA 1.1 (2)
* 4-in-1 digital media reader (3)
* The live CD doesn't work; you have to install from the alternate desktop CD (6)
* Suspend-to-RAM (7)

==== Current annoyances ====
None - everything works perfectly once properly configured :-)

* Intel PRO/Wireless 3945ABG Mini-PCI Express Adapter with WPA (4)
* IrDA 1.1 (2)

* USB mouse occasionally doesn't come up after suspend (fixed in feisty)
* Laptop occasionally does not suspend correctly after closing the lid (screen goes blank and computer freezes) (fixed in feisty)
* Bluetooth cannot be deactivated seperately (Fn+F5 deactivates Bluetooth AND Wifi) (fixed in feisty)

==== Notes ====
(1) To get a resolution >1024x768, you need to install ATI's fglrx driver. Simply use the Driver from Ubuntu's repositories and follow the instructions at the <nowiki>[[http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Edgy_Installation_Guide|Unofficial ATI Linux Driver Wiki for edgy]]</nowiki> (method 1 should work fine). For Feisty, see <nowiki>[[http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Feisty_Installation_Guide|Unofficial ATI Linux Driver Wiki for feisty]]</nowiki>

(2) To get infrared working, follow this guide: IrdaHowto

(3) To get the card reader working, add the module 'tifm_sd' to /etc/modules. A detailed instruction can be found at <nowiki>[[http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/How_to_get_the_internal_SD-CARD_working|ThinkWiki]]</nowiki>.

(4) Getting WPA to work with your Wifi card is a commonly known problem. It is easy to solve though; just install NetworkManager and deactivate the Wifi card in the Gnome network settings.

(5) A solution to the 'garbled screen' problem can be found at <nowiki>[[http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Installing_Ubuntu_6.10_on_a_ThinkPad_Z61m|ThinkWiki]]</nowiki>.

(6) You have to install feisty from the alternate desktop cd. The live cd won't work. Sorry.

(7) The Laptop won't suspend correctly until you edit your /etc/default/acpi-support as follows:
<pre>
...
POST_VIDEO=false
...
</pre>

(8) If you start from the live CD, X will fail to load - it will attempt to start six times, then an error message is shown. Wait for this error message to appear, switch to a console using ''<Alt>''+''<F1>'' and type
<pre>
''startx''
</pre>
The X server will start now.

(9) ATI's video driver ''fglrx'' (up to at least version 8.42.3) has a serious bug in it which prevents the computer to suspend or hibernate correctly. The hibernate LED will flash indefinitely without the computer ever to shut down. This problem is well known, but without a fix from ATI (which is yet to be released) suspend and hibernate simply won't work. If you can do without 3D hardware acceleration, try the open-source mesa driver (which means, simply do not install fglrx).
