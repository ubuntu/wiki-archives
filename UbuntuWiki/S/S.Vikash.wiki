| My View On Ubuntu
| ''I first started using Ubuntu version 5.10.But I didn't explore much on it.Now I have started exploring more and now I have come to know that Ubuntu is The Best Operating System and I am sure that it will continue to stay that way and I've never looked back nor regretted it. My distro of choice(and indeed the introductory one) is Ubuntu and I really do like it, not only because of it's features or freedom, but mostly because of the excellent community it has.I have met some fantastic people via the IRC chats and without there helpful support I wouldn't have achieved what I have thus far, I too wish to contribute in this way!''
