=== Install ===
Use cases follow. If you don't already have Ubuntu running, you should consider installing <nowiki>[[http://docs.google.com/View?id=ajdnb7qcpxx3_2424jssjvdq|Ubuntu in a VM]]</nowiki>.

==== Use Case I: Laptop Already Running Ubuntu 10.04 (Lucid) ====

** Follow instructions for adding the Sugar Team PPA from launchpad: https://edge.launchpad.net/~sugarteam/+archive/ppa
** run <code>sudo aptitude install ubuntu-sugar-remix</code>
** UsesUSR

==== Start-up ====
=== Actions ===
* Boot the XO
* Press the <nowiki>[[image:Mesh_key_f1_small.png‎]]</nowiki> button to navigate to the Neighborhood, this is where you <nowiki>[[http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Network_Configurations|connect]]</nowiki> to wireless networks and other XO's in your classroom.
* Join the "RIT" (Unsecured) wireless network.
* Verify you are not connected to a Mesh network. (See the third note below.)

==== Notes ====
* The XO boots into <nowiki>[[http://www.sugarlabs.org/|Sugar]]</nowiki>, the XO's <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fedora_%28operating_system%29|Fedora]]</nowiki> Linux-based operating system.
* The XO will connect properly to a WEP or WPA enabled AP. However, The XO's are unable to see the WPA network SSID on RIT's campus.
* XOs are able to simultaneously connect to both a mesh network as well as an access point. Because of special ad-hoc mitigation on RIT's network, this functionality is currently unavailable. Therefore, you must always ensure you are using only one of the interfaces while on campus.
* * Point the mouse into any corner of the screen to show the Frame. Towards the right, next to the power indicator, you will see the currently active connections.

=== Connect to the Internet, Download and Use IRC ===
==== Actions ====
* Go back to "Home view" using the Home button: <nowiki>[[image:OLPC_Home_Key_F3.png]]</nowiki>
* <u>Single</u> click the globe icon <nowiki>[[image:browse_activity.png]]</nowiki> to open Browse. Check your e-mail, perform a Google search, etc.
* (There is no double clicking in Sugar. Double clicking can launch two instances of an Activity, which will be confusing and consume precious memory.)
* Navigate to http://activities.sugarlabs.org search for and download the irc client.
* Use the Frame <nowiki>[[http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Journal|Journal]]</nowiki> icon, <nowiki>[[image:Journal.jpg]]</nowiki>, to open the Journal. It is a datastore browser and record of everything that occurs with Sugar.
* When it is finished downloading, click the <nowiki>[[image:Olpc_irc.png]]</nowiki> icon and the IRC activity will start and be put in your activity list.
* IRC is set to automatically connect to irc.freenode.net and join the channels #olpc-help and #sugar. Feel free to introduce yourself in the #sugar channel or ask for help in #olpc-help.

==== Verify ====
* The file downloads from the browser.
* The Activity is installed, and its icon shows up in the Frame.
* The Activity loads.

=== Playing an .ogg file in Browse ===
==== Actions ====
* Click on the Browse Activity in the Frame to switch to it and type "ogg samples" in the Google search bar.
* Click on the first link.
* Scroll down to the sample files, and click on one of the .ogg files.

==== Verify ====
* You can switch between running Activities using the Frame.
* The browser opens the totem-player.
* The file is played.

=== Installing an Activity from USB ===

==== Actions ====
* On your personal laptop (or school desktop), go to http://activities.sugarlabs.org/en-US/sugar/addon/4184
* Download the sudoku Activity bundle (sudoku.activity.xo) <!--(the sudoku bundle doesn't even work on Build 653 -- see bug <nowiki>[[http://dev.laptop.org/ticket/5839|#5839]]</nowiki> -- perhaps try another activity instead? --<nowiki>[[http://wiki.laptop.org/go/User:chihyu|chihyu]]</nowiki>)-->
* Copy this to a FAT-filesystem USB key.
* Put the USB key into the XO.
* Go to the Journal and click on the USB key icon.
* Type "sud" in the search window.
 Find the sudoku.activity item, and click on it.
* Click start. (the activity should install and load)
* Quit the activity.

==== Verify ====
* The USB key icon comes up in the Journal.
* Searching for "sud" gets you the sudoku Activity bundle (along with anything else on the the key with "sud" in the name)
* Resuming the bundle, installs the Activity and runs it.
* * The Activity bundle should be unzipped in /home/olpc/Activities (that's what is meant by installed) <!--(due to bug [http://dev.laptop.org/ticket/5839 #5839], /home/olpc/Activities won't even exist if there are no other activities installed prior to the test --[http://wiki.laptop.org/go/User:chihyu|chihyu])-->
