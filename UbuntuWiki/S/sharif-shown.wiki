=== About Me ===
I'm a IT student with a lot of free time and a pasion for techology and new stuff and things and all the interesting stuff on the Internet. I started using Ubuntu 3 years ago and it was love at first sight. So now I help other users join the free, fun and beautiful side of Open Source.
