__TOC__

== Starfish ==

We are tired of bad gpg graphical tools with poor design so have created a project to produce a better tool.

See https://launchpad.net/starfish

=== Goals ===

The aim of the project is to provide the user with a way to create an online identity which is secure and accessible to make friends with other people.

* Allow self identification (key creation)
* Allow sharing/publishing of identity (sync)
* Allow the searching of people and the creation of links in a web of trust.

=== Schedule ===

* No schedule, experimental phase only.
