=== About Me ===

I'm a 19 year old first year student in UCD Ireland. I'm studying Computer Science at the moment which is a four year degree. We are learning C right now but I'm aiming to learn C++ and Python in the next year or so aswell.

=== First Step in Ubuntu ===

I started using Ubuntu back at 7.10 and have been hooked ever since. I use Windows for some games but other than that Ubuntu is what I primarily use on both my desktop and netbook

=== My activities ===

{*} Finally decided to get involved with Ubuntu. Hoping I can help and learn as much as possible :P

=== My Future ===

I am looking to permanently work within the IT industry whether voluntarily or as a career. I just really enjoy learning as much as I can about computers and such :P

=== My Hobbies ===

I am a lifesaving instructor for Irish Water Safety and swim alot. I also love cycling and gaming :D
