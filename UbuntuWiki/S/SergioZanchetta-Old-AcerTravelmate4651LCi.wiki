* Brand: Acer TravelMate
* Model: 4651LCi
* Website: 
* S/N: -
* updated 23. April 2006 for dapper

=== Current Issues ===
Issues with Breezy Badger (5.10):
* use "nolapic" kernel option for LiveCD and Installer
* internal cardreader is not supported by linux kernel
* (fixed in dapper) hibernate (aka suspend to disk) hangs on resume, sleep (aka suspend to ram) works. hibernate works with <nowiki>[[http://www.suspend2.net|suspend2]]</nowiki> (tested on debian sarge with a custom 2.6.12 and 2.6.14 kernel with this hardware). as a side note: suspend2 seems to be more feature rich, better tested and more actively developed than swsusp and therefore i'd recommend to incorporate suspend2 into ubuntu.
