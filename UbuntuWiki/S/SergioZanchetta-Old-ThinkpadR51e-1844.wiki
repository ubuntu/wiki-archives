==== Notes ====
acpi_listen only reliably shows the power button event.. Even then the button must be depressed for a significatn amout of time.  
Other events will process immediatly after the power button event??? Weird!

There are ACPI errors on startup. Tried nopci, same results. 

The dsdt compiles successfully. 

Computer will sleep to RAM but will not wake up? Fan comes on HD does not appear to access/no video/no key response (caps lock etc)
