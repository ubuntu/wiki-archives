== Re-Approval Application for Ubuntu Switzerland (ubuntu-ch) ==

<nowiki>[[File:SwissTeam/Artwork/ubuntu-ch_cross.svg]]</nowiki>

The Ubuntu SwissTeam is a group of enthusiastic people dedicated to spreading Ubuntu in Switzerland. We often get together at conventions, meetings, parties, and online

The team, which has been active for more than 4 years, consists of Ubuntu users from all over Switzerland. Our varied membership reflects the diversity of languages in Switzerland: French, German, Italian and Romansh.

For us, giving Ubuntu love and support doesn't stop at Switzerland's border. Many team members also participate in other groups on Launchpad such as Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Edubuntu, Documentation Team, German, French and Italian Translators, BugSquad and so on. 

Of course, quite a few of us are active Ubuntu members.
