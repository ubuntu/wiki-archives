== License Review ==

This page serves as an overview or my understanding with regards to the Ubuntu components and the licensing requirements. I have purposely not visited various sites for input, as a copy and paste approach doesn't really help understanding. The idea would be to write it as I understand it, and then fill it out with more (correct) information.

=== Freedom ===
Licensing concerns the actual license and the freedoms associated with the license.

When we speak about 'free' software, free is defined not as in money or cost, but free as in freedom. This freedom includes the freedom to:

* Access to the source code
* Use the software for any purpose
* Make copies and distribute without payment or royalties
* Modify the source code and create derivative works without payment or royalties

If the above conditions are met, the software is a candidate for inclusion in main or universe.

For some software applications, the software may not contain source code but be binary only drivers (Nvidia is a good example). Although this is able to be redistributed by Ubuntu, there is no source code available. This software would reside in restricted or multiverse.

=== Academic vs reciprocal licenses ===

Some licenses are considered academic (originated from academic institutions), these licenses allow all of the above freedoms, including the ability sublicense (or relicense) the derivative or new work. The BSD, Apache and MIT licenses are examples of such. 

Reciprocal licenses are licenses that ensure that derivative work is reciprocated in some way. The GPL is an example of this which states that any derivative work that is released, is released under the same license.

=== Ubuntu components ===

* Main / Universe
* Restricted / Multiverse

==== Main / Universe ====

Licenses that meet the above freedoms, are considered candidates for main or universe. There is no definite reason for a packages inclusion in main or universe. Packages in main are usually foundation components of the system and contain the software that most other software builds against. Universe tends to be more third party software that is not a core system requirement. Packages in universe are more supported by the Ubuntu community and MOTU team. This means that updates, security fixes, bug fixes are generally community driven, but many updates are also provided by Canonical employees.

Due to this nature, packages in main can only include build depends, depends and recommends on other software located in the main repository. If software in universe is needed by other software in main, it is arguable that that universe software should reside in main. If this is required, either the package in main need to be demoted to universe, fixed to not depend on the universe package, or the universe package promoted to main by filing a MIR (MainInclusionRequest). Suggests can be used to suggest a package located in another repository as Suggests does not install automatically.

==== Restricted / Multiverse ====

Restricted and multiverse consist of redistributable software but software with licensing that does not meet all the requirements for inclusion in main / universe. This is normally in the form of binary drivers or licenses that are not approved as licenses which offer the freedoms expected by main. Although restricted may be supported by Canonical, the support is often best effort as often no source code exists to debug problems, and there is a reliance on a 3rd party vendor.

=== Resources ===
There is typically a list of licenses which meet the requirements for main inclusion.

<nowiki>[[ http:--www.debian.org-legal-licenses ]]</nowiki> has an example of licenses that do and don't meet these requirements.

=== Other ===
If a package has no license, it is considered not distributable and not valid for inclusion in any archive.
