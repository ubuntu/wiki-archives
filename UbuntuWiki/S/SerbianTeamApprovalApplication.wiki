During its existence, Serbian Team has become one of the biggest free software communities in the region. We have established all infrastructure needed for an active online action, including the main web portal, mailing list, forum and wiki. Public actions such as install shows and presentations, media activities and general support that the team provides, together with the activities in cyberspace, made Serbian Team eminent and reliable Ubuntu and general GNU/Linux resource in country and region.

=== Roadmap ===

==== Stronger cooperation with other free software teams in our country ====
  Although we are already collaborating with local free software communities in our country, we plan to expand further that collaboration and spread the free software love. 

==== Creating additional CD ====
  The default Ubuntu installation disc comes without Serbian localization files, and without some software which is not distributed due to software patents in the USA. Broadband in Serbia is also rare, and slow, hence sometimes packages travel faster through snail mail. We plan to create an additional CD/DVD with a selection of packages and distribute it through out ShareIT network.

==== Expanding the core administration team ====
  Our community has grown exponentially in the past two years, and we are constantly looking for new forum, site, and wiki admins to compensate for the growth.

==== Organizing lectures & events across Serbia ====
  Until recently, all our events have been held in Belgrade. We have plans to give some presentations & lectures throughout Serbia. 

==== Decentralization ====
  We have plans to make local teams in other cities and towns in Serbia, in order to provide effective community in out country.

==== Closer cooperation with translation team ====
  Several forum members expressed interest in helping our translation team. We plan to set up the infrastructure to help them coordinate and improve translations.

==== Creating commercial ecosystem around Ubuntu and free software ====
  Ivan Petrović has started a project of developing commercial ecosystem around Ubuntu in Serbia (which will probably be located on http://www.ubuntusrbija.org ). Also, two of our members work for the local company that sells computers (http://www.list.co.yu) and they are installing Ubuntu on every computer they sell without commercial operating system. We plan to reach out to companies that are involved (or want to be involved) in Ubuntu, and make our LoCo the central place for such ecosystem.

==== Release parties ====
  Ubuntu and Free Software are fun, so we plan to make release parties in future as tradition and make them around the Serbia. The 7.10 release party is the part of that plan.

==== Promo material ====
  T-shirts, caps, teacups, pens... With Ubuntu and Ubuntu-RS motives of course :) 

=== Experience ===

  Due to problems with our postal services and customs, we have organized an action of sharing and distributing Ubuntu CDs across Serbia.

  With 900+ members, 14000+ posts and 1500+ topics, forum is the pinnacle of our LoCo team. The most active sub-forum is "Absolute beginners talk" with 280+ threads and 2600+ posts. We've been very successful in attracting new users to Linux, and we keep supporting them.

==== Meetings ====

  First "get to know each other" meeting of forum members was held on November 17, 2006 (<nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu-rs.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogcategory&id=13&Itemid=37|writeup]]</nowiki>). During that meeting, the core team of administrators was formed, new site design was drafted, and a lot of beer was drunk ;) .

  Second (in person) meeting was held after the Install Show. New duties were assigned, forum reorganization was proposed, and wiki was set-up.

  The core team has established regular on-line meetings on a weekly basis.
