==== Notes ====

"This works atleast in dapper!"

Fn+F6/F7: Theese are the keys assigned to dim/lighten up the screen. There aint any solution(that I'm aware of) to get theese keys to work, but there is an binary(program) that can do it. The source and instructions on how to use it can be found at http://tz.exit0.net/tecras1.html

--------------------

To get IR(DA) to work you have to use two simple commands in the shell:

sudo echo activate> /sys/devices/pnp0/00:0c/resources

sudo modprobe smsc-ircc2 ircc_dma=3 ircc_irq=3 ircc_fir=0x130 ircc_sir=0x2f8

Be sure to issue the commands in this order as they won't work otherwise!

Now if you do an "sudo ifconfig irda0 up" you should then see irda0 if you type "sudo ifconfig".
If you don't want to bring up the device but rather just see that it's in the list you could also just do "ifconfig -a"

Intrepid:

I installed Intrepid (8.10) successfull on this laptop. I got many Fn-Keys and Bluetooth working with the omnibook driver project: http://sourceforge.net/projects/omnibook 
A detailed description can be found here: http://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/Toshiba_Tecra_S1 (german only, but the commands mostly speaks for themselve). The omnibook driver may be interesting for other laptop models as well.
