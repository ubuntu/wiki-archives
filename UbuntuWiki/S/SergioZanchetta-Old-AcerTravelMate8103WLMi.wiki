Currently running Ubuntu 8.04 (Hardy) installed from the Desktop CD. No serious issues. I have yet to update the below table...

=== Current Issues ===
* Slow disk detection at boot, see bug <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/bugs/223235|#223235]]</nowiki>
* Hibernation broken, see bug <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/bugs/226069|#226069]]</nowiki>
* Resume from sleep issues, see bug <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/bugs/238189|#238189]]</nowiki>
* The built-in microphone doesn't seem to work, I am not able to do any sound recording. There is one capture tab in the Volume Control panel by default, and two other capture channels can be enabled in the Volume Control preferences, still none of them work. I can hear an external microphone, but to record from it using Sound Recorder is a little tricky, see bug <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/bugs/66714|#66714]]</nowiki>

==== Hardy notes ====
* *8 The wifi-enable front button light does not work.
** Bug <nowiki>[[http://launchpad.net/bugs/21367|#21367]]</nowiki>
** Needs this command(reboot or unload/reload module afterwards): `echo options ipw2200 led=1 | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/ipw2200`

==== Edgy notes ====
* The console does no longer work (CTRL+ALT+F1-6) with usplash
** Bug <nowiki>[[http://launchpad.net/bugs/63558|#63558]]</nowiki>
* *1 Added line to the Monitor section of xorg.conf: <code>Option "MonitorLayout" "LVDS,AUTO"</code>
** Bug <nowiki>[[http://launchpad.net/bugs/22985|#22985]]</nowiki>

==== Dapper notes ====

* *15 Not with Kubuntu/KDE
** ''Set the keyboard layout to Acer Travelmate 800 and they start to work'' -Tony
* *16 Not in Kubuntu.
** ''Works in Gnome'' -TormodVolden
** ''In k3b, add dev=/dev/cdrw as a parameter for cdrecord, solves the problem'' -Beat Wolf
* *17 add a section to xorg.conf
<pre>
Section "InputDevice"
        Identifier  "Synaptics Touchpad"
        Driver      "synaptics"
        Option      "SendCoreEvents" "true"
        Option      "Device" "/dev/psaux"
        Option      "Protocol" "auto-dev"
        Option      "HorizScrollDelta" "0"
EndSection</pre>

and modify the section "ServerLayout" and add this line in it: 
<code>InputDevice     "Synaptics Touchpad"</code>
** -Beat Wolf

==== Breezy notes ====

The install locks up if "linux noapic" is not entered at the boot prompt, bug <nowiki>[[http://launchpad.net/bugs/36983|#36983]]</nowiki> (fixed in Dapper Beta 2).

* *2 custom dsdt table, beforehand, it did not work in Hoary
* *5 Could only boot with noapic, it seems this causes pcmcia to crash on bootup
* *9 Only tested with the DVI output
* *10 Has to be chosen manually during installation.
* *11 Works as "eject cd", which is wrong but handy :)
* *12 The volume has to be unmuted in the Volume Control program
** ''This is related to <nowiki>[[http://launchpad.net/bugs/30014|#30014]]</nowiki> ''
* *13 Needs an updated DSDT to have it working. For instance, download the dsdt.tar.gz in <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=46536|this posting]]</nowiki>, unpack and copy it in like this: <code>sudo cp DSDT.aml /etc/mkinitramfs/; sudo dpkg-reconfigure linux-image-2.6.12-9-386</code>
* *14 Works with fglrx drivers
** ''if using Kubuntu, you should add "dpi=96" into ~/.kde/share/config/displayconfigrc, or you will have huge fonts '' -Beat Wolf
** ''does not work since last update. now create a file called .Xresources in your home directory and write Xft.dpi:96 in it.'' -Beat Wolf

==== Hoary notes ====

* *3 Custom 2.6.12-kernel-compiled with intel HDAudio (did not work before)
* *4 Custom 2.6.12-kernel-compiled with ipw2200 1.0.4 + added firmware ipw2.3 (did not work before)
* *6 added manually in keyboard shortcuts

==== Other comments ====

The battery life ist quite low. Under Windows I get a battery life of 3.5 hours, and under Kubuntu Breezy and Dapper only 1.5-2 hours. Please report if this is any different with Ubuntu.
** ''Had Ubuntu running for more than two hours, using wifi, and there was still some battery left'' -TormodVolden
** ''Various things contribute to battery life.  Turning the bluetooth off, unplugging PCMCIA cards, having the backlight brightness turned down all contribute.  Which of these have you lowered?'' -PaulSladen

The differences between the models 8101/8103/etc are CPU frequency, RAM and HD size. Otherwise, the hardware components are the same.
