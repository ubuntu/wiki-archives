==== Notes ====
* * Proprietary nVidia driver was required to achieve proper resolution (1280x800), Ubuntu defaulted to 1280x720 without it.
* ** Brightness randomly fluctuates up and down as if unsure of brightness value set (more testing needed) - only occurs when on battery (see <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/524214| bug 524214]]</nowiki>)
** xserver-xorg-video-nouveau was not tested
** *** It's very hit-and-miss when the power state changes (i.e. A/C to battery, after hibernate/suspend)
