=== Team overview ===

Home page: 
* http://wiki.ubuntu-it.org/GruppoTest
* https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-it-testing
Informational pages translated into italian: 
* http://wiki.ubuntu-it.org/GruppoTest/Iso
* http://wiki.ubuntu-it.org/GruppoTest/Casi/DesktopLiveSession
* http://wiki.ubuntu-it.org/GruppoTest/Casi/UnrLive
* etc.
Test adoptions: 
* http://wiki.ubuntu-it.org/GruppoTest/Casi#adozioni
Test performed: 
* http://wiki.ubuntu-it.org/GruppoTest/Casi/Svolti/10.04

* useful because the ISO tracker does not keep historical data linked
** Well, it does keep it, but there is no current way to show it ;-)
  
There are some requirements to become an approved member:
* LP account
* Wiki page
* Performing a test appropriately

13 Members, 7 are new contributors to Ubuntu in the Italy ISO tester group
Between 3 and 9 people tested each milestone

Most users prefer to do live tests as they do not have extra hardware
 - what about using e.g. Test Drive?
 - and kernel automated testing (usb bootable) -
   - hand out thumb drives with the automated test suite on them to run (checkbox on boot)

=== Team's Data ===
** how many approved members at the end of the cycle
	13 people
** how many of them never contributed before
	7 people
** how many tried to participate (mailing list subscriber against members)
	54 ppl in ML - 5 already ubuntu members = 49 (26,53% of them are active members)

=== Leader's experiences ===
* Why LoCo should do tests?
** win win condition. Ubuntu become better, LoCo get a simple task for newcomers
* how many time is needed to lead the team? Is it a demanding activity?
** very demanding, see following Mailing Messages statistics
** December 107
*** Pages set up, translation and first "learning" tests
** January 140
*** Alpha 2
** February 57
*** Alpha 3
** March 342
*** Laptop test started
*** Group becomes official announced also in forum and newsletter
** April 247
** May 44

* things easier and harder
** Live test very easy to perform, wide participation
** harder: explain how to report a bug if system doesn't boot
* best lesson learned
** kiss: keep it simple stupid
** testing is fun and also make hype: more people blogging about new features, it's also a marketing effect
** newcomers learn how ubuntu is being made and how to report detailed bugs
** some people started contributing in other areas (translations, triage, doc, etc)

=== Improvements ===
* We need more statistics from Iso Tracker, also in a raw format (to be managed later in OOo)
** user activity
** past reports
** Statistics of test reports that encourage people to do more (similar to 5-a-day for triage)
** Launchpad karma for testing
* Could hook into Launchpad teams (drupal API) and know about which testers are on which teams and display a chart similar to http://wiki.ubuntu-it.org/GruppoTest/Casi so LoCo members could see what they're covering
how to speed up reporting
* previously reported bug on same testcase
* space trimming in bug's input box
* Information
** if a user marks started a test and there's a respin he's notified 
* Other types of testing
** Functional, regression, SRU, usability

=== Next steps ===
* Decide together more test cases based on live version
* Keep and increase test coverage
* Add more images and test case (server?)
* More LoCos start their testing teams
* organize a sort of competition in testing

=== How can the larger QA community help? ===
* Improve ISO tracker to show history, add communication/social features
** maybe LP karma for tests?
* Competitions for testing... "Testing Olympics" or "World Cup of Ubuntu Testing"
