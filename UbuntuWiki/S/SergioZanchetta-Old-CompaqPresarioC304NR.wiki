| Turns Wi``Fi On/Off after NdisWrapper is configured. Turning it back on requires <code>sudo rmmod ndiswrapper && sudo modprobe ndiswrapper</code> to start back up. Turning On/Off with KNetworkManager works great!
|}
==== Notes ====
This laptop receives an '''A-''' only due to the fact that I have to use NdisWrapper. Hopefully one day soon the Broadcom drivers will work correctly in the kernel so I can use Network Manager. Other than that, this laptop works excellent with Kubuntu Linux. The temperature stays cool as I just ran it wireless on my lap for 2.5 hours. That is how long the battery lasted on a full charge. The laptop went into hibernate mode successfully and came out successfully. KDE-Guidance is awesome, as it was 100% accurate the entire time running on battery. The speed of the laptop is great, as I did some packaging work with it this evening without any issues. Compilation times are great, graphics are awesome, sound is a little low, but I am sure there is a fix somewhere for it, unless that is the state of the sound system on this laptop.
