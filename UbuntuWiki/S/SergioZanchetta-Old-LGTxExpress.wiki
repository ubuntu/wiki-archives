=== Current Issues ===
- Wired ethernet card (Agere Systems et131x did not work out of the box, but required separately compiled module).

- Synaptics Touchpad did not work correctly, required patching driver.

- Installer didn't create a swap partition big enough to hibernate (1024 MB of Ram) by default.

- The sound module (intel-hda) required option model=lg to work correctly.
