=== Location ===

Will it be again in Lausanne, or do we want to choose a different location in the Western part of the country? Possible places could be

* Lausanne
* Geneva
* Neuchâtel (./) (./) (./)
* Fribourg
* somewhere in the Valais ?

Please vote by putting a checkmark (./) on the right of the location. If you don't know how to put a checkmark, just copy mine :-?

It's difficult to decide for the location if we don't know where you will have a conference room --HassanElJacifi

We need to decide soon as we still have no location, please everybody, check if you know a possible venue!

=== Date ===

Saturday, November 15 th, same day as Zürich

=== Schedule ===

As suggested in <nowiki>[[SwissTeam-RelasePartyIntrepid]]</nowiki>, we need to cut down on presentation time. In Zürich the talks will last 15-20 minutes with a pause of 15 minutes to allow the talker to get his stuff ready.

Another suggestion is to make two distinctive tracks for Newbies and Advanced users.
