=== Why Ubuntu ===

Because I love to share my knowledge, and i also like to learn new stuff, that's why i feel so identified with the ubuntu comunity,  Just because of the people that uses it... the people that help making it better, making it in their native language... its just great, thousands of people helping with the same goal, i cant' say other words about it... I even try to follow the Ubuntu Code of Conduct on a daily basis... 

To me ubuntu its not only software, but a way to be. Ubuntu is a word that means Humanity to Others, and i sometimes think that this is what others need... Humanity...

I've been saying from quite a while, that the philosophy behind Ubuntu its one of its greatest and strongest points... because '''our''' community its based on collaboration without any kind of interest.

=== Advocacy ===
This is a list of what i've done in Venezuela, related to the Ubuntu project

* Given talks at some places 
** <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/VenezuelaTeam/GutsyParty|Gutsy Parties / Fiestas Gutsy en Venezuela + Ubuntu-ve's Aniversary]]</nowiki> Web develpment from ubuntu for all
** <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/VenezuelaTeam/jornadajgh|Jornada de Charlas UBUNTU UJGH]]</nowiki> Web develpment from ubuntu for all
** <nowiki>[[http://www.kapacita.net|Kapacita]]</nowiki> Introduction to the Ubuntu Linux desktop (Feb 16)
* Taken part on the FLISOL 2007 @ caracas (April 28), with RolandoBlanco and DaniloJaime and other ubunteros, where many people came to know about Ubuntu.(Which was our <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/VenezuelaTeam/FeistyCitas|FeistCita ]]</nowiki>
* Taken part on the FLISOL 2008 @ caracas (April 28th) with the ubuntu-ve caracas team, where we  installed ubuntu in about 60 computers (lots of  laptops and few desktops)  there are pictures <nowiki>[[http://picasaweb.google.com/nejode/FLISOL2008CARACAS|here ]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[http://picasaweb.google.es/tovar.nelo/FlisolCaracas2008|here]]</nowiki> (I many of us didnt had time to take our own pictures)
* Given a installation workshop at Flisol 2008 @ paraguana (I was in first place going here, but because of some problems with the local... it had to be moved 1 week after the date it was supposed to be, giving me the chance to be at both events) this time i had time to take <nowiki>[[http://picasaweb.google.com/foursixnine/FLISOL2008Paraguana|pictures]]</nowiki>
* Helped the Ubuntu-ve Stand on the CNSL3 At caracas
* I attended to the <nowiki>[[http://www.cnsl.org.ve/tiki-index.php?page=caracas|CNSL 4]]</nowiki> along with some members of Ubuntu-ve, carrying our banner
* A Small migration processes:
** in  the Company i Work, we picked up ubuntu for both, development and production stages, and we're using actually Kubuntu (hardy, gutsy) for the developers, Ubuntu Server 8.04 (4 servers), and Ubuntu for the non tech pepople (Bosses, assistants, requirement analysts, Quality Asurance Analysts and some of the Administration departament.
* Close to where i live, i've spoken and showed many of my neighbors about the benefits of using FOSS, teaching them how to use it, and how to squeeze the juice out of (K)Ubuntu for their daily work/tasks.
* I've always been pro-ubuntu, even in the games i play. you can take a look at Tibia Forums in <nowiki>[[http://forum.tibia.com/forum/?action=thread&threadid=1934091|here]]</nowiki> i've done two posts... the most interesting is on the page #2. here is an extract: 

<pre>
  > also linux is for those who know what there doing
  > with a computer. "mostly used for programing and
  > such"

  Well may be you havent had the chance to ever get close to a box running linux... do you know how does it looks?... i invite you, go to google and type:

** - ubuntu beryl screenshot
** - linux ubuntu gamming
** - linux ubuntu live cd install
** - linux ubuntu end user
** - linux ubuntu desktop

  and any other stuff you would want to do on windows... (without even getting closer to having to know about programming)...
</pre>

=== Goals ===

* Getting to be one of the Kubuntu Developers and (K)Ubuntu Member
* Contribute To the Ubuntu Comunity and the Ubuntu Distro
* Get the Ubuntu-ve's <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/VenezuelaTeam/GruposRegionales|regional teams]]</nowiki> running to provide even more organization and key points for new ubuntu users, so they can get in touch with people close to them easily.
* Spreading Kubuntu among HighSchools, including those which are not meant to be for "tech guys". People tends to think that Linux its hard, but in fact, Ubuntu is making an old idea. And we have to break that wall, that says "Linux its for Techies/geeks/nerds..."
* Contribute to the PostgreSQL project as a developer
* Get <nowiki>[[https://projects.commandprompt.com/public/plphp|pl/php]]</nowiki> inside the Ubuntu repos
* Get Rotator Software (Where i Work) to be an UbuntuPartner
* Help to organize Ubuntu-ve's second anniversary in Caracas with the help of many ubunteros around like RolandoBlanco, <nowiki>[[https://edge.launchpad.net/~nejode|Nelson Delgado]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[NeloRTovar]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[https://edge.launchpad.net/~cmartinez28|Cesar Martinez]]</nowiki>

=== What i am Actually doing ===

* Being an Active member of the [VenezuelaTeam Ubuntu-ve], taking most activity in the IRC,  <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu-ve.org/user/25/track|forums]]</nowiki> and some events.
* Actually leading ubuntu-ve's caracas group (Choosen by public votation)
* I am taking part on the <nowiki>[[http://postgresqlcertification.org/home|PostgreSQL Certification Project]]</nowiki>
* I am the main programmer of the Rombo Transformation Server, and leading the Rombo Colaboration Comunity, on the <nowiki>[[https://rombo.org.ve|ROMBO project]]</nowiki> a BSD licenced Olap application, we use ubuntu for the server and the same for the client
* Being an PostgreSQL advocate, but found the way to mix it with Ubuntu, i'm founding a PUG (PostgreSQl user group) called <nowiki>[[http://grupove.org.ve|grupove]]</nowiki>, and our code of conduct, its the Ubuntu's code of conduct modified.
* Been proposing the idea to create a Tecnnology Laboratory in the community i live, not only to speak about software but electronics and so on (<nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_hardware|Open Hardware]]</nowiki>). So far i've got the interest of some entities, meanwhile in the project, Ubuntu is involved as it is not only ''software libre'' but it is also a way of thinking (For me), and in some kind of form, its a way to show people that they shouln't be afraid of using linux... it doesn't bite. I've proposed Ubuntu to be the Operative System we should use, specially the Edubuntu branch, for the courses we have planned to offer (For free).
