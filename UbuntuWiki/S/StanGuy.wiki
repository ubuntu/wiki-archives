== A little about me ==

I'm an ex-auto technician (yea, I know thats funny) turned webmonkey with a love for open-source. I'm a budding programmer who just stumbled upon ubuntu and have been very impressed. My wife is opening a restaurant/cafe that will have a free internet access point and I even convinced her to use ubuntu on the machine! Hopefully we can expand this and show local people and business how useful ubuntu linux really is :)
