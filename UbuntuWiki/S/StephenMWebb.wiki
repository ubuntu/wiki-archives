=== About Me ===

{{http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110905122820/themagicroundabout/images/8/89/Dylan.jpg|Fantasy Picture|align="right"}}

I have been developing on Unix systems since the early 1980s, and on Linux specifically since 1995.  I started with and used Slackware until 2003, when I was hired by Xandros (another Linux distribution) to develop security, automated package deployment, and server software, followed by ARM development work on embedded Linux systems.

I spent the last few years implementing the touch stack in Ubuntu and currently manage Unity 7 maintenance and work on Unity 8 desktop convergence.

I am also involved with the Debian project packaging games, and the GCC project, particularly the C++ standard library implementation (random number generators and regular expressions).  I have mentored GSoC students implementing GCC's libstdc++ regex library for the last two years.
