=== About Me ===

My name is `Fejjari ` Semah, aka the_illusionist. I am a Tunisian technology enthusiast, 
Web developer and Engineer in telecomunication and networking.

The first time I have heard about the Tunisian community was in 2011 and first time i had see the community AFK is in 2012 it is a such of  a good experience to spread the FOSS philosophy.It still a lot to do , we are always here 

==== Personal Linux Experience ====

I have first tried GNU/Linux in 2005 , than it has become my primary operating system in 2012

As my knowledge about GNU, FLOSS and Linux have grown, I have tested many Linux distributions such as arch, Trisquel , gNewSense,centOS, Mint  and fedora<<BR>>
But currently, Ubuntu Gnome is my OS.

=== Contributions ===

Since I have joined Ubuntu-TN I had the chance to learn a lot from the community and especially about the community.
I first started helping the community in the UGJ 12.10 by organization,traduction and I am tring to give any kind of help as possible as I can to our community.
