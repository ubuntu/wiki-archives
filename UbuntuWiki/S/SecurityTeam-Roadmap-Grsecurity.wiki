=== grsecurity features ===

Several <nowiki>[[http://www.grsecurity.net/features.php|features of grsecurity]]</nowiki> would be useful to have in Ubuntu.  While many of the patches have been superseded by mainline features (e.g. memory randomization), there are still some that remain generally useful.  In an effort to do this, we would like to extract individual features from the grsecurity patches and get them into shape for inclusion in the mainline Linux kernel.

* symlink/hardlink limitations
* fifo restrictions
* add more here...

The plan is to identify features, CONFIG settings, extract them into separate git commits, with fully tunable sysctl settings, and submit them for inclusion into mainline (disabled-by-default), and then enable them via procps sysctl additions.
