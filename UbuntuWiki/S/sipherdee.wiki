My last years of work were devoted to <nowiki>[[http://www.checkpoint.com/|Check Point]]</nowiki> products, notably administrating SecurePlatform firewalls which are running on a modified version of Red Hat Linux / Red Hat Enterprise Linux.  I also spent a lot of time administrating Cisco networking and VoIP equipement.

After many years of Linux usage and advocacy, I am getting more involved in the community.

== Community ==

Registered Linux User #318676, I proceeded to my first Slackware Linux installation in July 1996.  I then started to use Debian (1.3.1) until I became a true Mandrake advocate.  Ubuntu is the system I use on all my machines. Still, Windows is still needed on my main computer laptop for audio work I do.

Being subscribed to Linux Audio mailing lists for many years, I plan on contributing to those efforts.

The way I started is by joining the following project:

<nowiki>[[http://www.kollide.net/|Kollide]]</nowiki> - Projects Hosting

We are hosting initiatives such as <nowiki>[[http://amarok.kde.org/|Amarok]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[http://konversation.kde.org/|Konversation]]</nowiki>.  If you need server space for open source related work, do not hesitate to contact me!

Other interests: <nowiki>[[http://www.openbsd.org/|OpenBSD]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[http://www.gentoo.org/|Gentoo]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[http://www.pfsense.org/|pfSense]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_%28operating_system%29|Android]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[http://drupal.org/|Drupal]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[http://typo3.org/|TYPO3]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki|MediaWiki]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[http://openoffice.org/|OpenOffice.org]]</nowiki> + too many others.

== Certifications ==

* MCP: Microsoft Certified Professional
* UCP: Ubuntu Certified Professional ''(in progress)''
* ''(more to come...)''

When I went to college, I learnt to become a programmer.  As soon as I could I switched to the technical side of computer science but I am getting back to coding.  Getting to better understand PHP code at the moment I am also interested to dive into Python and Ruby/JRuby.

The reason I want to get into JRuby is because I would like to contribute to the <nowiki>[[http://opentg.org/|OpenTG]]</nowiki> (BBS) development.

== Ubuntu ==

<nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~my-mom-runs-ubuntu|My mom runs Ubuntu]]</nowiki> and she is enjoying playing AisleRiot.

I want to become more closely involved with Ubuntu.  I will get back to translation, spend more time on the <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/|forums]]</nowiki> and get more people to try using it.

I hope our government will take notice and get to use open standards.  To me, Ubuntu would be the right choice for Quebec.
