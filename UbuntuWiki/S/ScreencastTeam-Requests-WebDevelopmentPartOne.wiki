__TOC__

Aimed at windows or mac os using web devs, or those who would like an introduction to web development.

This will explain how to write html in gedit (but wont teach html), make web pages using nvu/kompozer, install/test in  other web browsers (epiphany, konqueror, dillo, IE6 etc), and upload pages to an ftp server. I'll expand on that later :)
