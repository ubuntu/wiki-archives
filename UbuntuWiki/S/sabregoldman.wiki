=== About Me ===
Although it has been in my house and in use for years, I did not really start using Ubuntu until the fall of 2010.  Since then, I have worked on creating Ubuntu appliances using !TurnKey Linux's TKLpatch.

My background is in the humanities.  At university, I specialized in the history and historiography of bastardy and the effects illegitimacy has on society.
