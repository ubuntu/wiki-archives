==== Notes ====
* 3d accelleration only possible using the fglrx driver, i had to install old libs for x11 to have 3d accelleration working see:
http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=75585&page=2&highlight=fglrx+mesa

* Had problems with my keyboard layout, System->Preferences->Keyboard clashes when changing the keyboard layout, to solve this problem i added this lines to the gnome session startup applications:

setxkbmap -layout "us" -model "pc104" -variant "intl"

* No boot splash for me, just the old ugly kernel loading, initrd shows: ¨no vesafb.ko found" but the module is in that location/
