Email: 
I'm a former QA and Build Engineer from Be, Inc. (The BeOS folks.)

I've been using Linux since 1995. I started out using Slackware. I've tried my hand at a variety of distributions, including Linux From Scratch. 

I moved to Kubuntu after my latest search for a decent distribution. I've been happy with it. As such, I want to contribute.
