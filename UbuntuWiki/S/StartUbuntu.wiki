== Welcome ==
Hello and Welcome to the Home Page of the '''StartUbuntu''' Project. This Wiki Page has a complete set of tabs which include everything about the project. You can navigate so easily and choose between 6 different tabs. Thanks for your interest about StartUbuntu. Your help, support and contribution are highly needed and appreciated.

== The Project’s Motto ==
''“Don’t aim for '''success''' if you want it; just do what you '''love''' and '''believe in''', and it will come naturally.”'' — David Frost

== What ==
Starting from 8th of April 2013, '''StartUbuntu''' - founded by <nowiki>[[amjjawad]]</nowiki> - is a huge international project and a massive community campaign that is aiming to reach out to <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_XP | Microsoft Windows XP]]</nowiki> Users and offering them - Linux - a modern, unique, stable, fast, almost 100% virus-free, powerful, highly customizable, free & open-source, and community based system which should replace their very old no longer supported Windows XP and breathe new life into their machines. '''StartUbuntu''' is simply offering '''NOT ONLY one''' 'replacement' for Microsoft Windows XP, but 9 options, 9 alternatives, 9 Operating Systems – '''Please see <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/about/about-ubuntu/derivatives | Ubuntu Family]]</nowiki>.'''

|}

Microsoft is offering two options to Windows XP Users (Small to Medium Business):

* If your current PC meets the system requirements for Windows 7 or Windows 8, you can buy Windows 7 Professional or Windows 8 Pro from a local retailer or Microsoft Certified Partner. 

* If your PC does not meet system requirements, consider purchasing a new business PC with Windows 8 Pro.

'''More Details''' can be found <nowiki>[[http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/enterprise/endofsupport.aspx | here]]</nowiki>.

'''StartUbuntu''' Project is simply introducing the <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/about/about-ubuntu/derivatives | Ubuntu Family]]</nowiki> to Windows XP Users. :)

== How ==

No doubt this is a huge project and definitely won't be easy to achieve its goals; it will require lots of efforts, time, energy, strong will, dedication and commitment. However, impossible does not exist in our dictionary and therefore, we can surely achieve our goals and make this yet another successful mission for Ubuntu Family.

This project requires a Master Plan. 

=== Master Plan ===

Please see <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StartUbuntu/MasterPlan | Master Plan Page]]</nowiki>.

== HOWTO Help? ==

Thank you for your help and support. We appreciate your interest and passion to spread the word of Linux. Please, read the below steps:

* Read <nowiki>[[StartUbuntu]]</nowiki> Wiki Page - the same page that you are at right now and check the 6 different tabs.
* Sign up by adding your name to the <nowiki>[[StartUbuntu-WhoAreWe | Members]]</nowiki> Page.
* Join <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~startubuntu | StartUbuntu Team on Launchpad]]</nowiki> - You need a Launchpad Account for that. It is a needed step for internal communications between the members of this project.
* Join our official IRC channel, <nowiki>[[http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=ubuntu-start|#ubuntu-start]]</nowiki> on Freenode IRC. While this is optional, many Ubuntu community members use Internet Relay Chat to communicate.
* <nowiki>[[https://blueprints.launchpad.net/startubuntu/+addspec | Register a Blueprint]]</nowiki> in case you have any idea to share with us regarding this project. So, please feel free to think loudly and share with us.
* '''Spread the word as much as possible'''. You can create some Artwork if you are a Graphics Designer (no need to be expert) and add that to <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StartUbuntu/Artwork | Artwork Page]]</nowiki>. You can use the Social Media as well which is a very good way to spread the word. If you do have a blog, it is so nice of you to write a post about this project. If you have a personal website, that would be even better specially if you have many visitors. If you run a Computer Shop or Company, this is an amazing chance to reach to more people. There are tons of ways to help us to spread the word :)
* Some Real-Life activities would be super helpful and great as well. Telling your friends, mates, etc. Show your friends Ubuntu or any of its variants and explain to them some basic features to attract them. There are tons of things you can do :)

== Communications ==
