There is an Ubuntu LoCo / FSFE (Free Software Foundation Europe) meeting every second Thursday of a month (with possible exceptions) at the <nowiki>[[https://bitwaescherei.ch|Bitwäscherei]]</nowiki> in Zurich. 

There is also a monthly <nowiki>[[https://wiki.debian.org/LocalGroups#Switzerland| Debian meeting]]</nowiki> in Zurich, which might be of your interest.

=== IRC Meetings ===

Currently, no IRC meetings are planned. You can, of course, always join #ubuntu-ch on irc.libera.chat to meet other !LoCo team members.
