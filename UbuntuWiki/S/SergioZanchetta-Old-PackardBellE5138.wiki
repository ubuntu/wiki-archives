==== Notes ====
The laptop has a key labeled Fn printed in blue. It is an alternate key switch to make several keys change functionality. For example, F3 and F4 keys may be switched to volume adjust up and down after pressing Fn key. Because the blue Fn key is not working, no alternate keys may be functioned.
