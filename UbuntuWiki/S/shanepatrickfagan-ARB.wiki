* What do you think you could bring to the Application Review Board

Well I think I tick most of the boxes for the ARB I can do code review, knowledge of the platform and lots of free time. Of course im not a MOTU and I dont maintain any packages but I have experience packaging small apps and I can asses packaging fine. 

My coding experience is mainly with C and C like languages C/C++/C#/vala but I am also good at python and ruby. So im capable of reviewing a variety of languages.

I am an opportunistic developer so I know all of the ins and outs of small apps which are the main target for this board's work and thats what I believe I can bring to this board.
