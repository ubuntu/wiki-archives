| Application checkpoint/restart in linux (linux-cr.org) provides the ability to checkpoint, restart, and migrate application and system containers.  This provides a very lightweight mechanism for load-balancing in the cloud.  To use checkpoint/restart, both kernel and userspace code are needed.  This blueprint is for the creation and maintenance of a PPA with the packages needed to let users use checkpoint/restart (as far as implemented in the upstream trees) in Natty.

The purpose of the session is to identify these missing functionalities and prioritize them in order to have a ready for production component for the Natty server delivery.

| We do not do a very good job of making sure that systems have a valid hostname.  This session is to review the ways that hostname gets set during install and on boot for desktop and server and for DHCP and static assignment and have clear documentation on how this is supposed to work so we can identify all the current deficiencies and get them fixed.

| Bash tab completion can make esoteric, complicated commandline programs much easier to use, but it must be consistent. Currently Ubuntu has a lot of tab completion enabled, but some commands are inconsistent with others. On the same vein, there are a lot of little things that can be done with command-not-found that will make it even better at helping users find the best program, not just a program.

| Drizzle is a lighter weight, more flexible fork of MySQL. They are planning a stable release in February, and will definitely be included in the Natty release. Many MySQL based projects will be able to use drizzle with very little if any modification. Drizzle's replication model is also quite a bit more flexible and enabled currently via rabbitmq (though that is pluggable). We should ensure that this works in Natty as well as mysql replication, if not better.

| Ubuntu currently supports a lightweight container approach through tomcat6 to deploying Java based web applications.  This is sufficient for use-cases with no dependence on a full JEE feature set and where popular tool-sets such as Spring are being used to assemble and integrate applications.  However, Ubuntu does not current package a full, modular JEE stack which has more widespread adoption in larger enterprises.    Consideration needs to be given as to whether the effort of packaging a full JEE stack will bring the required level of value to Ubuntu or whether the lightweight application server (through tomcat) is the correct approach for Ubuntu.
