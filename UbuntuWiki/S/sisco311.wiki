=== About Me ===

My name is Ferenc Czumbil aka sisco311. My hobbies are reading (novels), logic games, hamging out with my friends, watching movies and tv series and computers (of course).

I was first introduced to Linux in 2006 in the form of a Knoppix Live CD. I was very impressed by the OS so I decided to try other distributions too. Ubuntu 6.10 was the first distro which worked quiet well on my hardware. Since then, I only use Linux based Operating Systems on my desktop. I currently dual boot Ubuntu and Arch Linux.
 

=== Participation ===

I have been a member of the <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org|Ubuntu Forums]]</nowiki> since February of 2007.

Oh, I almost forget the Community Cafe Games forum. :-?

=== Testimonials ===

nothingspecial

I hope a lighthearted testimonial is acceptable. Over the years I have found sisco311 to be one of the most frustrating members of ubuntuforums.org and for this reason I would like to wholeheartly endorse his application for membership.
The reason I find him so frustrating is that every time I try to help someone on the forums with a bash problem or question, sisco311 turns up later with a superior, more useful, more sophisicated solution. I have learnt all kinds of command line skills from sisco311's posts, which are always helpful and polite. If I see sisco311's username in any thread on the forum I will read it because I will undoubtedly learn from it.
One of the nicest feelings I've ever had using ubuntuforums.org was a "thanks" from sisco311.
