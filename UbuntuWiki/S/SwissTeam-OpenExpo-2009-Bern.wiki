== OpenExpo Bern 09 ===

The Bern event of the bi-annual <nowiki>[[http://www.openexpo.ch/openexpo-2009-bern/ | OpenExpo]]</nowiki> fair will take place on 1.+ 2. April 2009.

==== Booth description ====

The organisers will provide the following:

* Free booth, square table with four chairs, poster display
* Free printing of a poster in A1 format, from pdf
* Free power supply and free WLAN (we might even get LAN if we are close enough to a commercial booth and bring our own cables)
* Free catering: coffee, soft drinks and snacks (some bad mouth say it's well worth to attend because of the excellent catering ;) )
