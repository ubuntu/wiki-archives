=== Summary ===

Add a test case tracker to Launchpad. The test case tracker will allow test cases to be defined for any Launchpad project. Testers will have access to a list of tests that give direction to test efforts. Test coverage can be validated at project milestones. Karma will be awarded for testing efforts. 

=== Release Note ===

This section should include a paragraph describing the end-user impact of this change.  It is meant to be included in the release notes of the first release in which it is implemented.  (Not all of these will actually be included in the release notes, at the release manager's discretion; but writing them is a useful exercise.)

It is mandatory.

=== Rationale ===

This should cover the _why_: why is this change being proposed, what justifies it, where we see this justified.

XXX - Let's be clear on exactly which problem we are solving -- jml, [[]]

=== User stories ===

=== Assumptions ===

=== Design ===

You can have subsections that better describe specific parts of the issue.

=== Implementation ===

This section should describe a plan of action (the "how") to implement the changes discussed. Could include subsections like:

==== UI Changes ====

Should cover changes required to the UI, or specific UI that is required to implement this

==== Code Changes ====

Code changes should include an overview of what needs to change, and in some cases even the specific details.

==== Migration ====

Include:
* data migration, if any
* redirects from old URLs to new ones, if any
* how users will be pointed to the new way of doing things, if necessary.

=== Test/Demo Plan ===

It's important that we are able to test new features, and demonstrate them to users.  Use this section to describe a short plan that anybody can follow that demonstrates the feature is working.  This can then be used during testing, and to show off after release. Please add an entry to http://testcases.qa.ubuntu.com/Coverage/NewFeatures for tracking test coverage.

This need not be added or completed until the specification is nearing beta.

=== Unresolved issues ===

This should highlight any issues that should be addressed in further specifications, and not problems with the specification itself; since any specification with problems cannot be approved.

=== BoF agenda and discussion ===

==== Feasibility ====
* Should this be done?
* Limitation of scope

==== Implementation details ====
* Is the testcase number unique, or could they overlap with bugs?
* States - Proposed, Active, Invalid, Inactive...
* Responsible users
** Testcase owner
** (Multiple) assignee(s)
* Editable summary
* Editable description/steps
* Interface to record results
* Lists of test cases?
* Bulk results?
