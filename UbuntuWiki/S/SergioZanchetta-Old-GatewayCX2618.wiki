==== Notes ====

You can enable the tablet like so:

Step 1. Editing Xorg.conf

From the terminal, enter the following, followed by your password (if necessary)

<pre>
</pre>

<pre>
Section "InputDevice"
Identifier "Tablet"
Driver "fpit"
Option "Device" "/dev/ttyS0"
Option "AlwaysCore" "on"
Option "InvertY"
Option "MaximumXPosition" "12550"
Option "MaximumYPosition" "7650"
Option "MinimumXPosition" "400"
Option "MinimumYPosition" "400"
Option "SendCoreEvents"
EndSection
</pre>

You also need to add 
<pre>
InputDevice "Tablet" 
</pre>
to the serverlayout section of your xorg.conf

Step 2. Configure serial interface with the tablet
Install setserial (search in Synaptics Package Manager

You'll need this in your /etc/setserial.conf:

<pre>
/dev/ttyS0 port 0x03F8 irq 4 baud_base 38400
</pre>

Step 3. Install modified version of fpit driver

Download <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/attachment.php?attachmentid=18739&d=1162482698]]</nowiki> and
<nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/attachment.php?attachmentid=18740&d=1162482698]]</nowiki>

Unzip and place in /usr/lib/xorg/modules/input

Step 4. Get your left-click working

In the Sessions applet (Click System, Preferences, Sessions) create two new items that run these commands:

<code>xsetpointer TOUCHSCREEN</code>
<code>xmodmap -e "pointer = 1 3 2"</code>

Step 5.  Switch your video driver from i810 to intel

Use Synaptic Package Manager (System, Administration, Synaptic Package Manager) to install the xserver-xorg-video-intel package.

Step 6.  Enabling rotation

I haven't found any information on how to do this yet.

Step 7.  Enabling the monitor panel buttons

I can't even figure out how to poll these buttons
