=== Ubuntu Biography ===

My first experience with Ubuntu was March 2010. Since then I am learning all I can about Ubuntu and Linux.  I would classify my-self as general end-user of Ubuntu.  Love the philosophy of Open-Source. Trying now to wean my-self away from Microsoft. I love learning new things with computers and enjoy helping others learn as well.  As I learn more I look forward to helping others learn as well. 

==== Hobbies & Interests ====
Not necessarily in this order:

* Computers (especially assembly/dis-assembly) 
* Automotive Tinkering
* Sound Board Mixing
* Photography
