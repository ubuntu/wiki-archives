==== Notes ====
* *Apparently, installing the package "sl-modemd" creates a device node for the ati-ixp-modem card and manages the soundcard modem. I haven't been able to test this though, as I'm having dialup issues and can only install the sl-modem daemon to check if the modem is recognized. If someone else with an ati sound modem could test this, email me.
-UPDATE- With testing, I found that while the sl-modemd package does support ati-ixp modems, it doesn't seem to cooperate with my model modem at all.
