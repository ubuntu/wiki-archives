=== Current Issues ===
Install CD fails to resize the pre-installed Vista Basic edition, needs to clean wipe the partition table (and hence lose on-disk install media).  LVM install hangs with lvmcreate in Feisty.

After hibernation both wireless NIC and sound system do not function, workaround for WIFI is to disable first.  Cold restart required to recover audio.

Volume scale is incorrect, maximum is higher than OSD display suggests.

Brightness controls switch on and off light and not consistent.
