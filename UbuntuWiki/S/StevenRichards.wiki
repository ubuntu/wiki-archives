== Steven Richards ==
I'm a long time Android developer and Ubuntu user, and have been using Ubuntu since Feisty Fawn. Just recently I have moved ships to the open source community to share my writing contributions with such teams as Ubuntu-Docs and Gnome-Docs. I also have been working with the various bugs in Ubuntu, Unity, and Debian by categorizing and processing them as they come in.

Although I have only been here for a short while, I look forward to long term contributions that I can bring to the community as a whole. Currently I'm applying to be on the Bug Control team along with hosting a Ubuntu CD Mirror located at http://mirror.slashdev.org/ubuntu/

=== Contributions ===
* Various <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/~steven.richards|bug]]</nowiki> report processing / triaging for Ubuntu, Debian, Unity, LibreOffice.

* Contributions for <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/ubuntu-docs|Ubuntu-Doc]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/gnome-user-docs|Gnome-Doc]]</nowiki> teams for Natty Narwahl.

* Writing and editing parts of the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/ubuntu-manual|Ubuntu-Manual]]</nowiki> (Maverick)

* Pending Review of an Ubuntu CD Image Mirror: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+mirror/slashdev.org

* Frequently helping fellow Ubuntu members in the #ubuntu channel on the <nowiki>[[irc:--irc.freenode.net|Freenode]]</nowiki> network.

* Successfully promoted a survey for Ubuntu-Advertising in order to gain feedback, promoted via twitter and got the survey link to show up in ~ >10,000 twitter feeds.

* Currently a member of... Ubuntu Advertising, Desktop Bugs, Ubuntu-Doc, Ubuntu-Manual, Ubuntu-Marketing, Ubuntu-Server, and Ubuntu-Testing

=== Goal(s) ===
I hope to bring the same amount of work and contributions that I shared with the Android community to the other projects related to Ubuntu and it's various packages. I look forward to working with all of you, promoting the Ubuntu philosophy, and sharing my passion for open source technologies.

I hope to be a member of the following teams some day :-) 

* Ubuntu

* Ubuntu Documentation Committers

* Ubuntu IRC Team

=== Ubuntu Beginners Team ===
