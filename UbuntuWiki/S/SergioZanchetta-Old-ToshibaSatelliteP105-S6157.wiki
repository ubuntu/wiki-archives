=== Current Issues ===

After hibernation sometimes, but not always, the CPU fan remains disabled.  In that case the CPU temperature might
reach 90+ C and more.  This is quite painful, and I always have a CPU temperature meter on my GNOME panel
for this reason.  I haven't noticed this problem with suspend-to-RAM.

==== Notes ====

Sound does not work out of the box because the ACPI init code is broken.  To fix,
download the <nowiki>[[http://acpi.sourceforge.net/dsdt/view.php?id=747|fixed DSDT file]]</nowiki>,
put it in `/etc/initramfs-tools/DSDT.aml` and run `sudo dpkg-reconfigure linux-image-$(uname -r)`.
The correct DSDT code will be loaded the next time the computer is booted.

Sound is broken with the new 2.6.22 kernel in Gutsy.

X starts up with in 1280x800 instead of 1440x900.  To fix that, edit /etc/default/915resolution
and set BIT=24  (I also set MODE=3c, XRESO=1440, YRESO=900, but these are probably not
necessary), then reboot.

To enable support for the fingerprint reader, you will need to install `thinkfinger`.  See <nowiki>[[http://www.linux-on-laptops.com/hosted/ubuntu-toshiba-U205-S507.html]]</nowiki> and
<nowiki>[[http://en.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Installing_Ubuntu_6.06_on_a_ThinkPad_T43#Fingerprint_Reader]]</nowiki>.
