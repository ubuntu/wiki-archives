== Screenlets by default ==

Include polished screenlets in the ubuntu distribution with an orange-brown look. Provide a nice button on the panel to bring up the chalkboard(widget layer).

We need some cool names for things so A button in the bottom left corner should activate the chalk board; a place where you can store notes, view stocks and know the weather.
