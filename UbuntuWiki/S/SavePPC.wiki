Brainstorm idea http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/idea/4296/

== Overview ==
As many PowerPC architecture owners have come to realise, the future of Ubuntu PowerPC support is in jeopardy. Canonical is taking stock at its process and looking to drop full support for the powerpc release and make it a community supported platform. The plan propose three implementations plans :

* PowerPC remains a fully supported platform
* PowerPC becomes a 'supported on the server only' platform (like Sparc)
* PowerPC becomes a community supported platform (like PA-RISC and Itanium)

See the PowerPC Review for full detail:

https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PowerPCReview

This page hopes to create awareness within the Ubuntu community about this issue and serve as a place for PowerPC and users of all architectures that are against this decision to voice their opinions. We are trying to be proactive in displaying our support for the PPC architecture, so don't bash or threaten or give ultimatums. Basically just put your name on the list

NOTE: there is already a large forum topic created under the PPC forums for commenting.
Please do not flood this page with long posts/opinions.

=== PowerPC Supporters ===

* SaulPerdomo -- Guatemala -- PowerBook G4 -- PPC users may not be numerous, but we sure are cooperative and active in the community. Come on, Canonical, don't lose a fiercely loyal user base!

* suribe -  "Linux for human beings that use i386, amd86 or sparc, but not powerPC"? I prefer "Linux for human beings"... (BTW: edgy AMD64 user)

* Timbobsteve - Please don't drop support for PPC, my ibook loves Ubuntu!

* MicroJackson - Please keep the PPC rocking.  Nothing nicer than a recent ubuntu install on a pismo!

* Ali - Please don't drop support for PPC/PPC64.

* ScottM - Powermac G5 dual 2Ghz is my main and only machine. Running Ubuntu.

* Ccinope - I use the PPC platform and would very much appreciate Ubuntu PPC being kept in active development.

* alphasubzero949 - I have two older 'books running Ubuntu.  Please keep PowerPC supported!

* CafePinay - Please continue support for PPC. I've just started running Ubuntu on my old iBook, and want to keep seeing it develop.

* EuroCity - My PPC computers are an iBook G4 (1.42 GHz), a Power Mac G4 (upgraded to 1 GHz) and an iMac G3 (upgraded to 500 MHz): all work very well with Ubuntu (and Mac OS X, of course). If you keep the PPC distro running, certainly there will be a quite large user base in the future, also considering that Ubuntu is the most Mac-like Linux distro out there, sofar: thus, it would be great if you continued with full PPC support in Ubuntu! :-)

* rm3m - I have an iMac and an iBook with Ubuntu. The iBook is a dual-boot system, and my "traveling office" for my computer support consulting. I can use it to demo Ubuntu to both Mac and PC users, especially the PC users whose Windows systems have been riddled with viruses and spyware. PPCs are going to be around for some time, and perhaps some other manufacturer will incorporate them into systems, maybe even IBM?

* Ulrik Sverdrup - I have another white Ibook G4 and use Ubuntu exclusively for my home and university use. The ibook works well under ubuntu ppc and I love that, in principle, all free software in the debianish sphere runs equally well on this old ppc as on a x86 machine. I'd like that to continue. I also like that everything works. Sleep works great and always has. Wireless works with the bcm43xx driver. Bluetooth works. The Ati radeon 9200+ mobility works fine with the free OSS drivers and I can run beryl (although I don't use it daily). So this machine is, thanks to ubuntu, a wonder of Free Software almost execlusively (if I wasn't a sucker for common media formats :) . Please keep this running, you don't realize how much we get for so little work.

* Mike Hore -- iMac G5.  I love the PPC and will never buy Intel.  As Apple are moving away from the PPC I'm starting to use Ubuntu as an alternative desktop system.

* nkbj -- Powermac G3 Beige.  Please keep the support for ppc.  I strongly prefer to have the same desktop all my systems (x86 and ppc).

* eidex -- running edgy on an ibook g4, please keep supporting the ppc platform!

* undercling9-99 -- Please don't waste the environment. The development of xubuntu for these imac G3's and G4's is doing so well.  There is a massive overlooked potential to get Linux on all these 3-6 year old computers (mac or PC).  So many people only need internet, word processing, email and some photo tools.

* ChrisLees -- I started with Ubuntu on PowerPC, to put new life into my iMac. This changed my life for the better, and now I am active in the Ubuntu community. Ubuntu-desktop for PPC is worth the effort. Besides, how can you expect companies to support a "2% market share" operating system when you don't support a 2% architecture?

* towsonu2003 -- I will buy sooner or later a cheap PPC and I'd like to have Ubuntu installed on it... PPC arch may grow as Apple takes its hands off of it and users start looking for other solutions. Also, it would be a shame to loose the userbase at http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=133

* JoshuaHenderson - I have a friend who uses the PPC version of Ubuntu, and it would be terrible if he wouldn't be able to update any more.

* SamTygier - Ubuntu works great on my ti powerbook g4. Linus Torvalds uses a G5, but probably not running ubuntu.

* KeywanNajafiTonekaboni - It's clear, that I can use Ubuntu on the iBook even as an Community Port, but it would have less importance as it already has and I guess the number of unresolved (even unreacted, unassigned, ignored?) bugs would increase

* BobPaul - Debian upstream supports PPC. That should be making Canonical's job easier. Keep the support at least as long as Debian does.

* Lane C - I have a last generation Powerbook and I am sure Apple will not support it nearly as long as I would like, I am hoping to convert it over to Ubuntu but not if support ceases.  Please Keep support going for our year old technology, there are lots of us still!!

* Xavier77 -- running edgy on an ibook g4 12", please keep supporting the ppc platform!

* Jerome B., Belgium -- I'm running Ubuntu/x86 on a few systems, and Ubuntu/PPC is the retirement plan of my dualcore PowerMac G5.  Pleaselet this machine have a second life when Apple drops support for it.

* AlwinGarside - PowerPC support is essential for <nowiki>[[PS3Compatability]]</nowiki>. If we can give the possibility to provide a completely supported Linux distro for the PS3, that could make it the leading PS3 Linux, giving us many more userbase.

* sastian -- PPC is essential here to as most of my machines are G4's and since apple is abandoning them the most noble solution is upgrading them to UBUNTU in the future.

* JustinHartman, South Africa -- really sad to read the PowerPC review as I have only recently installed Edgy on my 1.33Ghz iBook G4 PPC. The fact that PPC is supported by Ubuntu was a huge driving force in migrating over to Linux from OSX and it's simply disappointing even the notion of discontinuing it. If I wanted to run Ubuntu off a silly PC I would have done so but reading this now I have to seriously reconsider my options.

* shanus -- This would be an extremely bad idea.  There are tens of thousands of iBook G3 and G4 computers around the world in schools, take Maine as an example.  These computers no longer have support from the manufacturer(Apple) but yet have been used in 5th and 6th grades and kept in use by the schools systems.  Many schools are now looking at linux variants to keep using these machines because they cannot be upgraded to the latest Mac OS.  Maines total deployment alone is over 70,000 now so certainly there are other educational instituations with similar concerns.  Please keep in mind that they tend to be a bit slower to change so the support needs to continue for a couple of years longer.

* Pablo -- I use Ubuntu on my G4 Power Book, and having another architecture to test Linux on, was one of the reasons for buying it, and I both use on my desktops ubuntu linux, on x86, x64 and ppc, I wouldn't like to move to another distro to make my desktops uniform.

* FredericBages -- France -- Ubuntu is the best OS for my PCs and iBook G3. As I try to keep the same OS on my PCs and laptop I would have to change my PCs OS if ubuntu becomes unsupported on my iBook :-( Would it be at least possible to keep the "stable" release supported ? (i mainly use my laptop for browsing the net, reading pdf, ...) Thanks.

* EricB -- USA -- I use the PPC version on my PowerMac G5. I understand that if you were to drop official support for the PPC port, we could still have a community-maintained version. Despite that, I think there is still a lot of room for improvement and growth of the PPC Ubuntu version...the Ubuntu staff really needs to stay on this project and give it first-party support for at least a few more years.

* EmilOppelnBronikowski -- running Ubuntu on PegasosPPC G4 made by Genesi

* BlakeB -- running Ubuntu on a Powerbook G4, and kubuntu on an ibook G4. Please don't kill this project!

* Haroon -- I run Debian on a G3 iMac I use as a server, but have a G4 PowerMac that would be a likely candidate for Ubuntu (I prefer it as a desktop distribution) when OS X becomes long in the tooth.  Likewise, my dad has a G3 iBook that would likely see an Ubuntu install when OS X is no longer supported on that machine, and since Leopard appears to have dropped G3 support, that could be pretty soon.  Also remember that the PS3 and XBox 360 are PPC, and could benefit from Ubuntu.  There's a ton of PPC Macs being retired as of late; G3 iMacs are going for $50 or less occasionally and people are going to be looking for a reasonable OS to run on them before giving them away.

* Blake Irvin - Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania - Keep PPC Ubuntu alive for all the PPC Macs that won't be able to run 10.6!

* macspacejunkie - PPC already has large userbase. And even when those computers become quote-unquote "obsolete" and are donated to charitable causes, Ubuntu would be a great FREE OS for them to be able to run. It would keep slightly older Macs cranking for a few years to come.

* TilmanBaumann - Germany - PowerBook G4

* NatTuck - With all the current-generation video game consoles running on Power processors, the architecture is going to remain significant for a long time. The Ubuntu project should we working towards being the best Linux choice for the Playstation 3, not towards dropping chunks of its userbase.

* Didier17 -- France -- running Ubuntu (6.06) on iBookG4 and PCs. Please, continue support for PPC ! x86 platform is not the only one where Ubuntu is in use.

* Senmu -- Canada -- iBook G4

* Phantom784 -- USA -- One of the great things about Ubuntu is that it is an up-to-date, supported operating system that runs well even on older machines.  Drop PowerPC and you drop many legacy systems.  Besides, don't forget Playstation 3!

* Lengau -- USA/South Africa -- The PowerPC is set to become a big Linux platform as Apple drops its support for PowerPC chips and other systems (PS3, Xbox 360, Wii) begin to use PowerPC chips.

* DanielGTaylor -- USA/Germany -- iBook G4

* RussellDavies -- Vancouver, Canada -- MacBook. I hate OS X.

* MatthiasMuench -- Germany -- Save the PowerPC Port! I am using Ubuntu (6.10) on PegasosPPC.

* Rnat -- Italy -- I think that PPC port should be maintained... Very much people bought an iBook (like me :)) or a Powerbook in the last 2 years (for example in my engineering faculty), in fact Apple made record sales! So there will be much more users in the next future.

* MatteoBoglione -- Italy -- I like to continue to use ubuntu/PPC on my G4 Cube, a litte bit slow to run OSX smoothly... And I think that ubuntu is much better than OSX! Continue with your great work on Ubuntu/PPC.

* maestropaolo -- Italy -- Please don't stop supporting PPC

* marcomastri -- Italy -- Please don’t stop keeping my old laptops alive!

* StefanoPeron -- Italy -- Please i need linux for developing application on my "new" powerbook g4 15 alluminium

* Dirk.R.Gently -- USA -- I understand Ubuntu was to streamline its development.  However the move by Apple to Intel should have little bearing on Ubuntu's decision of what to support.  A fair number of people have powerpc hardware that's less than a year old.  In another year I could have better understood a move like this.  A good number plan to use it at least that long, myself included.

* RSaalmueller -- Germany -- Don't be the second foul apple. Go your own way, there's enough PowerPC hardware available for some time. Please don't let Intel win because the Ubuntu users have to buy new computers for 7.xx and 8.xx.

* Srose -- Please, keep supporting PPC architecture. I am trying this out right now on Live CD on apple iBook G4. I need to install Linux on this thing so that I can applications that are better supported in Linux than under OS X. I would love to install Ubuntu. But it will suck if you end support for this platform.

* AlexMuntada -- My main machine is a Mac``Mini G4 running latest Edgy (soon Feisty, I hope) and I'd consider purchasing a Power``Book G4 eventually.  Please, don't stop supporting PPC; I'm sure the user base will increase very soon for the reasons explained above.

* StephanNies -- Germany -- I use Ubuntu on an iBook G4 and i like the fact that i can use one linux distribution on all my hardware in fact thats one reason for me to use ubuntu. Also i was considering to buy a PS3 to toy with the cell, and i hope to find ubuntu on this platform too. IMHO the PS3 should be a first class citizen in ubuntu because it will be a great chance for ubuntu and linux in general to gain marketshare.

* Jack Overfull -- Italy  -- I tried all PPC distros out here. Ubuntu is the only one that really works "out of the box". Please, continue supporting it!

* Spike Burch -- USA -- I use PPC Ubuntu. I think that at the very least, LTS releases should continue to be released and supported on PPC. You guys have a huge chance here to dominate the PPC landscape, no matter how small it is.

* PierreBuyle -- Belgium

* Simon O. -- Austria -- I like ubuntu on my 368 machine and would like to continue using the same distro on my powerbook g4 as well. i love ubuntu on my powerbook.. at first I thought I would drop linux on ppc, because of java/flash issues... but I stuck with it, it's just the best.

* John McHugh -- USA -- I'm due to inherit a 17" G4 PowerBook in 2007 (when my wife gets a new Mac Book Pro).  I'd planned to install Ubuntu.  Hoping for the best.

* John Kelley -- USA -- I have a 15" G4 Titanium 550mhz PowerBook which I run Ubuntu on. Its given new life to what I thought was an obsolete machine. Keep the PPC support, its much appreciated.

* Tommy Trussell -- USA -- I'm running Ubuntu 6.06 on my ("oldworld") 1998 PowerBook G3 (AKA "Wallstreet II" OR "PDQ") so I can run up-to-date linux software PLUS my old Mac OS 9 software (via MOL). Even Apple never officially supported OS X on this hardware, but it runs linux just fine.

* Brendon D. -- NZ -- Ubuntu has a marvellous opportunity to increase widespread adoption with the Playstation 3 (as well as supporting other computers).  Having more than one distro that works well on PS3 would push each one to improve and excel.  Thanks for the PPC effort so far, I fear that the PPC port will not survive without official support.

* Craig Miller -- Canada -- I moved my 3 PowerPC Linux-based Macs to Ubuntu after "Community Support" of Mandrake, fell short. Ubuntu Install downloads are misleading (I have installed ubuntu on 5 Macs with one download). Supporting PowerPC means developers have to challenge thier assumptions (like little-endian memory), and flush out bugs that just don't turn up in a mono-architecture world. Supporting the PowerPC means that Ubuntu will have better quality software, moving forward, and will be positioned to address all those game consoles (all of which run PowerPC these days). Please continue to support the PowerPC architecture, for us, and for Ubuntu.

* aisforaccident -- Germany -- The reason I started Ubuntu in the first place was installing Xubuntu on my very old G3 for test reasons. Just to have look what that linux is about. Afterwards I was blown away by the whole Ubuntu family and now I run it on my desktop pc. I use Ubuntu as my first OS on my pc, Xubuntu at my parents home on the mac and I am going to get Ubuntu on my laptop. My point is I wouldnt use Ubuntu without Ubuntu on my Mac and I know others among my friends who got here the same way. Please consider the mac as an entry to Ubuntu in any decision concerning the develepment.

* Erik Chakravarty -- UK -- Agreed that Ubuntu/PPC DesktopCD ISO downloads constitute a minority '''''percentage''''' of the total downloads (this is representative of the distribution of x86/PPC hardware in the consumer market) but it's still a significant '''''number''''' of users to be shutting out!
* Vincent --France-- Ubuntu running every days on my Pegasos II G4
* ÉtienneBersac iBook G4 and iMAc G5 (iSight) running Ubuntu. I also updated french symbols map (commited in xkeyboard-config CVS).
* McR -- Italy -- I'm not a PPC user, but losing an architecture is like losing a part of our.We are all part of one great minority.
* Michael Flaig -- Germany -- I would prefer stopping official support one to two years in the future. Apple sold their last Powerpc Macs only about an year ago. We should make sure those users that bought one of the last Powermacs have at least a few more years of official and supported FUN! btw. Running Ubuntu Feisty on TiBook G4, and Xubuntu on Pismo G3.
* Philippe Leroux -- Quebec -- I just bought monday an ibook G4 and installed ubuntu... it works great (except keyboard layout problems with french canadian) don't stop support now!
* Olaf, using iBook G4 with Ubuntu. Requirements for newer versions of Mac OS X become higher and higher. Ubuntu could be a great alternative for older PPC-Macs, which will no longer be supported by Apple for financial reasons. Please don't stop your support of these machines!
* Shane O'Brien -- Ireland -- I have an iBook G4 and an AMD64 machine, both running Ubuntu. I'd like to be able to use the same operating system on both of them. Ubuntu on PowerPC is just maturing - I remember trying to run Hoary on my iBook and there were loads and loads of bugs - most of them are now gone, and even the wireless is working now. It'd be a pity to see support dropped just after things were getting better.
* MatthiasVDM - Belgium - I just installed ubuntu on my iBook G4. I was very pleased to see how easy the installation was and how great it looked on my iBook. Please don't kill this project!!
* Roberto Innocenti - Italy - I have installed Ubuntu on G3 ibook, G4 ibook , G4 powerbook, I have sell my Celeron-M laptop becouse I prefer Gnu/Linux PowerPC notebook. So is needed on PowerPC
* GeneH - Good Ol' US and A - I understand not making PPC's a priority & not holding up releases for PPC, but I too would like to see official Ubuntu support for the PPC continue at least for another two years or so. If that means that PPC releases might lag behind a month or so, that's fine with me.
* Martin Evans - Being i prefer PPC arch's to x86 i think it would be bad for such a great distro to drop support for it :(, please Ubuntu dont stop supporting the beloved PPC arch
* Gregor Rosenauer - I'd love to run (K)ubuntu on my old but trusty Apple Powerbook G4, which is still very useful for my needs. Else I'll continue to run Gentoo which still supports PPC...:^)
* JeffAbbott - I have several PPC machines, ranging from older Quicksilver Power Mac G4s to a dual 1.8GHz G5, and I'd love to be able to continue running a supported Ubuntu release on them.  Fedora, Gentoo, and other distributions are continuing to support PowerPC due to both the large installed base, as well as new systems being sold by Sony, IBM, and Genesi, and I'd really prefer to not have to migrate to another distribution just to maintain distro coherency across my multiple boxes.
* Roberto -- Mex -- Powerbook G4 1.5 15” I been working BSD’s for the last 9 years, I consider myself as a true hard core user of BSD’s, after so much pressure of my friends (who use BSD’s too) I open my heart for the first time to Ubuntu two years ago I haven’t change my habits so much but I’m truly surprise how deep is the rabbit hat hole on this great human OS.
* AndrewBarber -- No comment
* Unnamedculprit - Ubuntu runs excellently on my PPC G3 iMacs, much better than OS X (and os9 is pretty much out of date now), and when Apple finally abandon the PPC platform, the only user friendly OS left will be Ubuntu, but not if they abandon us also
* GazHay - My G3 iMac Video wall runs xubuntu on them (though xubuntu seems to have already dropped PPC in v7) Please don't drop PPC support, my G3's are still very viable machines, including as large screen video walls!
* Marko71 (Canada) - There are millions of PowerPC Macs. Apple is eager to  abandon them, I suspect. They are still great computers. If there's no Linux support, where will these computers go? TO LANDFILL. Linux is the Ecological OS. And Ubuntu is the best Linux.
* Flabdablet (Australia) - Just lined up a lovely second-hand G4 for my Mum, who is no longer able to use OS 8 on her 5500 because there are no drivers available for new printers, and convinced her that the pain involved in switching to Ubuntu would be worthwhile because it would future-proof her.  Ironic, no?
* Atom10 - Only concerned about PS3 support.
* Codyl - People are still using PPC based machines somewhere in the millions. If it was dropping a much older architecture say 68K, then it would make sense. But it would be insane to drop support for PPC.
* Osos - Finland
* mattr01 (Matthew Rossi of The Penguin Central Podcast (http://penguincentral.co.nr), Australia).  There are many people that are still using PPC hardware today.  Linux is intended for everyone despite the vast differences in hardware.  Support PPC Linux :)
* Rickard6 - Sweden  Please, keep supporting PPC architecture. I'm a happy iBook G3 Xubuntu edgy user https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LaptopTestingTeam/Apple_iBookG3_12in_700Mhz, that was hopping for gutsy. What can I do?
* RandallSmith2 - US  I run Ubuntu on my clamshell ibook g3 and it runs nicely.
* llamallama - US  I run a G3 Indigo iMac. Just because it's out dated doesn't make it useless. Ubuntu has quickly become the best way to give these old Macs new life. I really hope it will continue.
* J_Douglas_Hall - US  My employer has several aging dual-core G5 Power Macs that would make excellent servers - if only they had a decent 64bit linux-based operating system, like Ubuntu. Please keep supporting the PPC!
* JensFinkhäuser, UK - Please don't drop support for PPC! Concerned about G3/G4/G5 and PS3 support.
