==== Notes ====

# Graphics card is Nvidia so need to use alternate CD to install.
# i386 version: wireless works with ndiswrapper and the win98 drivers, as per the  information on the <nowiki>[[http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/joomla/index.php?/component/option,com_openwiki/Itemid,33/id,list_o-z/|Ndiswrapper Card List]]</nowiki>.  Chipset is RTL8187B, ID is 0bda:8189.
# i386 version (possibly amd64 as well): to get integrated webcam (id: 5986:0101) to work I used the latest version of uvcvideo together with this patch which simply adds an entry for the webcam (patch submitted to uvcvideo so may appear in later versions):
