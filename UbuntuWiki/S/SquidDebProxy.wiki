== Using squid to cache deb packages ==

The squid proxy server can be configured to cache deb packages. Only minor tweaks 
are needed for this. Here is a example config that can be added to the default /etc/squid/squid.conf

<pre>
refresh_pattern deb$   129600 100% 129600
refresh_pattern udeb$   129600 100% 129600
refresh_pattern tar.gz$  129600 100% 129600

refresh_pattern changelogs.ubuntu.com/*  0  1% 1
</pre>
