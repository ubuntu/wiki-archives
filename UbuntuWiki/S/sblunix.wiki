=== About Me ===
My name is Sam Stoddard and I'm currently a resident of Saint Louis Missouri. I go to Lindbergh High School and I take college classes online. During the summer I take classes at Truman State University in Kirksville. I'm fluent in English, French, and Bulgarian (as well as Python, Java, Javascript, C++, and HTML). I love to travel and learn new things, observing other cultures is definitely a passion of mine. I enjoy reading, be it fiction, non-fiction or an Ubuntu Newsletter/Guide. <<BR>>

I first discovered Linux in June of 2007, It was my first year at Truman State during the summer, and I was taking advanced programming in Java. My Professor was a true Linux advocate and a user of Debian. He preached Linux to the class while we were learning Java, and at the end of the summer, he gave every student a copy of Debian to try when they got to a home computer. From then on I went to discover other Linux distros, eventually landing on Ubuntu. My first release of Ubuntu ever was 8.04, I loved it and never could use a different Linux Distro if I tried. It took me almost a year to realize that not only was Ubuntu a great operating system, it also had a great community as well. I first joined the Ubuntu Forums, where people made me feel at home, answering questions I had, and to my surprise, asking questions I knew the answer to. I love helping others and I think the Ubuntu community is one of the best ways out there for me to help educate others.

==== Current Project & Goals ====
* My main project for the time is aiding Ubuntu Beginners with the {*} <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BeginnersTeam|UbuntuBeginnersTeam]]</nowiki>.
* As always, I work very hard to help out the Ubuntu Community. I'm very active on the {*} Ubuntu IRC and {*} <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntuforums.org|Ubuntu Forums]]</nowiki> trying to answer as many questions as possible.
* I'm also a very big tutorial and tool junkie, I'm skilled in Python, Java, Javascript, and C++ (and HTML if that counts). I've been working hard on coding and writing small tools that can make everyday desktop use easier and faster. I also spend many hours writing tutorials for beginning Ubuntu users, many of which are still in draft state.
* I'm always adding to the Ubuntu-Docs, and Ubuntu-Wiki... Some pages I've created from the ground up are:

==== Future Plans & Projects ====
To continue to make myself available to assist anyone and everyone I can, learn how to better use Opensource software, be an upstanding member of the Ubuntu Community, and further the Opensource mission.
