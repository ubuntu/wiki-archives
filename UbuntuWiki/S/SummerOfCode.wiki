== Ubuntu and Google Summer of Code ==

Ubuntu has participated in <nowiki>[[https://developers.google.com/open-source/soc|Google Summer of Code]]</nowiki> since 2006. Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is an annual program that encourages students to participate in open source software projects. Organizations like Ubuntu apply to mentor students, and students apply to work on particular projects over the summer. Successful students are awarded a stipend, and, most importantly, a t-shirt.

The program is a wonderful way to bring new people into our community and to get new projects off the ground, providing students with experience, a great item for their portfolios, and, hopefully, some new friends.
