== LXQt ==

<nowiki>[[ http:--lxqt.org- | LXQt ]]</nowiki> is the <nowiki>[[ http:--www.qt.io- | Qt ]]</nowiki> port and the upcoming version of <nowiki>[[ http:--lxde.org- | LXDE ]]</nowiki>, the Lightweight Desktop Environment. It is the product of the merge between the LXDE-Qt and the Razor-qt projects: A lightweight, modular, blazing-fast and user-friendly desktop environment. This screenshot shows Lubuntu using LXQt desktop (in a very alpha stage):

=== Get LXQt ===

==== Lubuntu Next image ====

There is a LiveCD image available at http://people.ubuntu.com/~gilir/ Dated 22nd August along with the md5 checksum. This is not regularly updated, but is a quick way to get a preview.

==== Stable Packages ====

As of December 2015, LXQt packages are now available in the regular Ubuntu repos for Xenial Xerus (16.04). However, unlike the PPAs below, there is no lxqt-metapackage yet (waiting to get merged into Debian at time of writing), so you have to install each package:

<pre>
sudo apt-get install lximage-qt lxqt-about lxqt-admin lxqt-common lxqt-config lxqt-globalkeys lxqt-notificationd lxqt-openssh-askpass lxqt-panel lxqt-policykit lxqt-powermanagement lxqt-qtplugin lxqt-runner lxqt-session lxqt-sudo pcmanfm-qt qterminal qupzilla
</pre>

If you have a normal Lubuntu install, there will be some packages to get rid of:

<pre>
sudo apt-get purge light-locker xfce4-power-manager
</pre>

If you are using a netboot like below, then you'll need to make sure to add the window manager:

<pre>
sudo apt-get install openbox obconf-qt
</pre>

With this, you can just report bugs like normal.

Note this will not include the current artwork. If you'd like to add that, you can do the following:

<pre>
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:lubuntu-art/daily
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install lubuntu-artwork lubuntu-icon-theme
</pre>

==== Daily Images ====

<pre>
    <div style="background-color:#FFCDCD;border-radius:6px;padding:16px;border:1px solid red;">
    <h3 style="color:red;">WARNING!!</h3>
    Daily images can break at a moment's notice. Continue at your own risk.
    </div>
    <br>
</pre>

At time of writing, daily images are built for version as early as Saucy Salamander (13.10).

===== Adding LXQt to an existing lubuntu installation =====

At present two ppa's need to be added, one is lubuntu's head of dev and the other our head of artwork. Follow this by updating the list of available things to install and add the LXQt meta-package which has a list of the all the files it needs, followed by the lxqt artwork.

<pre>
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:lubuntu-dev/lubuntu-daily
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:lubuntu-art/daily
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y lxqt-metapackage lubuntu-artwork lubuntu-icon-theme
</pre>
Then log out and upon the login screen you will the choice of using lubuntu (lxde) or (lxqt).

===== Installing LXQt on fresh system =====

You are strongly advised to use a virtual machine for this, let us be honest... it WILL break at some point!

* Download and install the netboot image of <nowiki>[[http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/qatracker/milestones/351/builds/106568/downloads | i386 xenial]]</nowiki>
<pre>
sudo -i
apt-get install -y software-properties-common
add-apt-repository -y ppa:lubuntu-dev/lubuntu-daily
add-apt-repository -y ppa:lubuntu-art/daily
apt-get update
apt-get install -y lxqt-metapackage openbox qupzilla obconf-qt lubuntu-artwork lubuntu-icon-theme
reboot
</pre>
It will take a couple of moments for the graphical login prompt to appear. 

Now, this is a very basic install but do go and have an explore.

=== Reporting Bugs ===

If you want to report a bug on the Lubuntu Next ISO, or when using the daily PPA with Qt packages, please report any bugs on https://bugs.launchpad.net/lubuntu-next. The bugs should be triaged there. It has not been triaged recently, but is on the list of things to do for the dev team.

For packages in the repos already, bugs can be reported like normal, against the appropriate Ubuntu package.

Upstream issues can be filed on https://github.com/lxde/lxqt/issues. You can chat with LXQt people on IRC (#lxde on freenode) to check first.

It is advised that you first report to Launchpad if you are unsure.
