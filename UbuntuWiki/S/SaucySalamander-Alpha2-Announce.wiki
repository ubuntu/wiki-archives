"Perhaps I'm too saucy or provoking?"
 ― Benjamin Franklin

The first Alpha of the Saucy Salamander (to become 13.10) has now been
released!

This alpha features images for Kubuntu, Lubuntu, Ubuntu GNOME, 
and UbuntuKylin.

Pre-releases of Saucy Salamander are *not* encouraged for anyone
needing a stable system or anyone who is not comfortable running
into occasional, even frequent breakage.  They are, however,
recommended for Ubuntu developers and those who want to help in
testing, reporting and fixing bugs as we work towards getting
this release ready.

Alpha 1 includes a number of software updates that are ready for wider
testing. This is quite an early set of images, so you should expect some
bugs.

While these Alpha 1 images have been tested and work, except as noted in
the release notes, Ubuntu developers are continuing to improve Saucy 
Salamander.  In particular, once newer daily images are available, system
installation bugs identified in the Alpha 1 installer should be verified
against the current daily image before being reported in Launchpad.
Using an obsolete image to re-report bugs that have already been fixed
wastes your time and the time of developers who are busy trying to make
13.10 the best Ubuntu release yet.  Always ensure your system is up to
date before reporting bugs.

There have been some adjustments to the release schedule for 13.10 
since the last vUDS, so for the latest plans, please check:
