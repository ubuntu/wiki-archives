__TOC__


We have modified the way events are used. The calendar functions will be including meetings as well as events.

It is important that a few rules are followed in order to achieve a constant flow that is easy to read.

== Caution ==

Although adding events is fairly straight forward, it is generally advisable to ask for a little help before you create your first event.

If you create an event and are not sure if you did it right, please contact the mailing list to have them double check it for you.

Please notify the mailing list of this event so we can have a chance to spread the word and attend.

== Adding Events ==

 1. Go to the <nowiki>[[ SouthDakotaTeam-Events | Events ]]</nowiki> page.
 2. Find correct date in calendars. ( Can use arrows to find date )
 3. Click date. ( Double check date )
