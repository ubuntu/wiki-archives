=== Summary ===
SELinux is a security infrastructure providing many benefits for server and enterprise desktop administrators. It has been well tested by Red Hat in both their Fedora Core and RHEL offerings and there's a growing community built around it. There are now useful policies and tools to manage SELinux.
This spec wishes to investigate whether enabling SELinux by default in Ubuntu is a viable goal, and what the best method is for achieving that.

=== Rationale ===
MACLs are a useful security feature enabling fine-grained control of a system. In certain circumstances, they can mitigate vulnerabilities in software and also help defend against viruses and hackers.
