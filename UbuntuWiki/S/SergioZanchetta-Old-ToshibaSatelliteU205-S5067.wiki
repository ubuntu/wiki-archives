=== Current Issues ===

==== Copy /lib/modules/... ====

The "Install base system" step failed:

  debootstrap: Cannot find /lib/modules/2.6.22-14-generic

Copying the installer modules to works around this issue:

  $ cp -a /lib/modules/2.6.22-14-generic /target/lib/modules

Then run the "Install base system" step again.

==== Suspend to RAM ====

Suspend to RAM fails with the installer kernel.  See the Linux kernel <nowiki>[[http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7780|bug report]]</nowiki> for this.

==== Mute ====

Pushing the mute button or Fn+F1 brings up the volume overlay graphic but doesn't actually mute the sound.  When the mute button is pushed the overlay displays the mute icon but when Fn+F1 is pressed the overlay only briefly displays the mute icon before immediately restoring the un-muted icon.

==== Notes ====

==== Upgrade BIOS ====

The factory installed BIOS version 1.4 resulted in frequent errors:

  APIC error on CPU0: 40(40)
  APIC error on CPU1: 40(40)

After upgrading the BIOS to version 3.7, I didn't see any more such errors.
