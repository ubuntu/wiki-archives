''' This blueprint is incomplete. '''

=== Summary ===
This blueprint outlines the procedures to be taken to ensure cross communications with the Inferno sub-system.

=== Release Note ===
The Inferno platform provides speech synthesis for IRC Clients. This daemon application captures synthesizing requests; parses them accordingly and passes them to a specified speech synthesis engine. With this centralized system, it provides a flexibility in what kind of speech synthesis engine is used.

=== Rationale ===
Having such a daemon may be prove to be redundant; Speech Dispatcher provides the same services as the Inferno daemon. However, support for the <nowiki>[[http://mary.dfki.de|MARY TTS]]</nowiki> via Speech Dispatcher is not currently available in Linux. The Inferno daemon provides said support by using the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/libopenmary|C++ API for MARY]]</nowiki> written also by the SpeechControl team.

=== User stories ===

=== Assumptions ===
* Is using xChat or Irssi.
* Has the <nowiki>[[http://mary.dfki.de|MARY TTS]]</nowiki> installed at the location '/home/<user>/.marytts' and running.

=== Design ===
The daemon will run in the background, with a minimal GUI interface. This 

=== Implementation ===
* Daemon monitors a file and read the request from disk

=== Effort ===
* None as of yet
