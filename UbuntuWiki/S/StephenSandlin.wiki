=== About Me ===
I've been using Ubuntu starting the fall of 2005, I mostly use my computer for gaming and chatting.  I have no programming experience at all, and don't really know even the basics, I know some unix commands but not enough for my tastes, I will probably eventually buy a book and look at some cool ones.  Right now I'm creating a Laptop testing page for my Alienware MX7700, feel free to contact me any time about that, or anything else if you feel like it.  My favorite games on linux so far are classic blizzard games under wine (World of Warcraft, Diablo II, Starcraft, Warcraft III), Tremulous, and old console-game emulators.
