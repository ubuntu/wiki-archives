==== Notes ====

* On 7.10 though very rare the laptop will sometimes miss on resolution and leave you with a blank screen at boot up. Press power button to force shutdown.

* *  Same with 7.10 and 8.04.1. Headphone jack works but will not mute main speakers. Add the line: ''options snd-hda-intel model=lenovo-nb0763'' to the bottom of file ''/etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base'' to fix.

* ** Wireless will not work out of the box with either 7.10 or 8.04.1 and requires ndiswrapper used with SiS 163u Windows XP driver. Once done works fine. Follow the instructions below to install the driver.

*** Download 163u '''Windows XP''' wlan driver from SiS website: ''http://www.sis.com/download/''.

      {i} You must use the XP driver as the Vista drive will fail!

*** Unpack the files: ''sis163u.cat'', ''sis163u.inf'' and ''sis163u.sys'' from the ''/R105_Logo/SetupNT/USB/'' directory within the archive and place in a location of your choice on your system.

*** Install: ''ndiswrapper-utils-1.9'' via your preferred method.

*** From the terminal run: ''sudo ndiswrapper -i /your_path_to/sis163u.inf''.

*** We now check if the driver has correctly installed. From the terminal run: ''ndiswrapper -l''. If all is good you will
    see the following output:

    sis163u : driver installed
        device (0BF8:100F) present

*** Next we do the dependencies and load up the ndiswrapper kernel module. Run: ''sudo depmod -a'' followed by
    ''sudo modprobe ndiswrapper''. This will load everything and allow you to use Network''''''Manager to check if any wireless
    networks are available.

    Note: Rebooting will drop the module.

*** To have the module loaded at every boot add: ''ndiswrapper'' to a newline at the bottom of the file ''/etc/modules''.

* *** You will see messages at shutdown and reboot from the ''Network''''''Manager''. See: <nowiki>[[http://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/network-manager/+bug/138691|Bug 138691]]</nowiki>. To work around this and allow the interfaces to shutdown cleanly, perform the following.

The following will require ''sudo'' permissions.

*** Go to '''System -> Administration -> Network'''.
*** Click '''Unlock'''.
*** Once unlocked... Select '''Wired connection''' then click on '''Properties'''.
*** Uncheck the box '''Enable roaming mode''' then in the '''Configuration''' box below select '''Automatic configuration (DHCP)'''.
*** Finally click '''OK''' ... wait for the interface to refresh itself and then click on '''Close'''.

Now when you shutdown or reboot you should no longer see the messages. :-)
