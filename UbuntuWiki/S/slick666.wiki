Hello and welcome! My first computer was a commodore 64 when I was just 4 years old and have been involved with computers ever since. I was bitten with the Linux bug when I got my first Co-op in 2005 and haven't looked back since. I bought an Apple back in 2006 and officially got rid of all of my Windows machines just a couple months later. After working from Slackware to Fedora to Debian I started running on Ubuntu exclusively back at 7.04. After getting involved with my Local LUG I discovered the upstate NY LoCo. I relocated to the Midwest back in 2011 and am currently working on bringing Ubuntu to the Lawrence area and promoting the freedom of choice that we seem to have less and less of.
