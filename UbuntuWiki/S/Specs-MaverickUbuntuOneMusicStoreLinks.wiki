=== Summary ===

Open the Ubuntu One Music Store from a web link -- how can this be done? How do we make it work in all browsers? How do we handle someone on a non-Ubuntu platform clicking the link? If you have experience of custom URL schemes, JavaScript, or using iTunes music store links, please come along to the UDS session.

=== Release Note ===

NOT YET COMPLETED

=== Rationale ===

This should cover the _why_: why is this change being proposed, what justifies it, where we see this justified.

=== User stories ===

NOT YET COMPLETED

=== Assumptions ===

=== Design ===

You can have subsections that better describe specific parts of the issue.

=== Implementation ===

This section should describe a plan of action (the "how") to implement the changes discussed. Could include subsections like:

==== UI Changes ====

<pre>
TODO: work when user is showing the music store itself

1. Look up a song to get a music store link.

Primary Scenario

1. User clicks toolbar button

2. Rhythmbox opens popup window

+----------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                          |
| /----\   Looking up _What Do You Do For Money_           |
| | U1 |   _Honey_ by _AC/DC_ from _Back in Black_         |
| \----/                                                   |
|                                                          |
\----------------------------------------------------------/

3. Rhythmbox successfully finds song and updates window

/----------------------------------------------------------\
| x v ^    Ubuntu One Music Store                          |
+----------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                          |
| /----\   Found _What Do You Do For Money_                |
| | U1 |   _Honey_ by _AC/DC_ from _Back in Black_         |
| \----/                                                   |

(Window grows to accommodate the new text.)

USE CASE ENDS

1.a Variation - No song is currently playing

.1 Rhythmbox disables the toolbar button

USE CASE ENDS

2.a Variation - User is playing something that isn't a song (e.g., radio)

.1 Rhythmbox opens window with error message

/----------------------------------------------------------\
| x v ^    Ubuntu One Music Store                          |
+----------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                          |
|  /!\     Unable to automatically detect which song is    |

\----------------------------------------------------------/

USE CASE ENDS

3.a Variation - Song is looked up "successfully" but we get it wrong

.1 Rhythmbox updates the contents of the window

/----------------------------------------------------------\
| x v ^    Ubuntu One Music Store                          |
+----------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                          |

| \----/                                                   |
|          Found _Mony Mony_ by _Billy Idol_ from          |
|          _Billy Idol's Greatest Hits_                    |
|                                                          |

|                                   [Tweet this address!]  |
\----------------------------------------------------------/

Note that the "Looking up" line stays present if the found song
is not an exact match. This means that the user can see that what
was looked up and what was found are different, and close the window
using the normal close button in the title bar. (The window has no
explicit close button!)

USE CASE ENDS

3.b Variation - Couldn't contact 7digital

.1 Rhythmbox updates the contents of the window

/----------------------------------------------------------\
| x v ^    Ubuntu One Music Store                          |
+----------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                          |
|  /!\     Unable to look up the song (couldn't connect    |
|          to Ubuntu One.). Please check your internet     |
|          connection, or try again shortly.               |

==== Code Changes ====

Code changes should include an overview of what needs to change, and in some cases even the specific details.

==== Migration ====

Include:
* data migration, if any
* redirects from old URLs to new ones, if any
* how users will be pointed to the new way of doing things, if necessary.

=== Test/Demo Plan ===

It's important that we are able to test new features, and demonstrate them to users.  Use this section to describe a short plan that anybody can follow that demonstrates the feature is working.  This can then be used during testing, and to show off after release. Please add an entry to http://testcases.qa.ubuntu.com/Coverage/NewFeatures for tracking test coverage.

This need not be added or completed until the specification is nearing beta.

=== Unresolved issues ===

This should highlight any issues that should be addressed in further specifications, and not problems with the specification itself; since any specification with problems cannot be approved.

=== BoF agenda and discussion ===

Use this section to take notes during the BoF; if you keep it in the approved spec, use it for summarising what was discussed and note any options that were rejected.
