Hi. I am an Electrical Engineer, with a passion for Linux and OSS. I have dabbled a little in Linux over the years but only took it seriously in the summer of 2005 when I was introduced to SuSE linux 9.0

RPM hell got the better of me and I moved to Ubuntu and I have never looked back. I now use Ubuntu as my primary system and try my best to show others the light..

I am a budding programmer, with my first project being Ubuntu Control Center. Great ideas are always welcome and life permitting I hope to be at the forefront for OSS development in the near future...
