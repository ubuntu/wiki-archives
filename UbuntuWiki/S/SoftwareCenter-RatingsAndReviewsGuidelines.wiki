== Guidelines for a good review ==

The intended audience of the review are other users. Please keep that in mind when writing the review and be brief and informative. Bug reports should be posted to the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+filebug|Launchpad bug tracker]]</nowiki> instead. If you are the upstream author and review your own software, please add a comment about this to the review.

'''Be respectful'''. The Ubuntu community and its members treat one another with respect. Everyone can make a valuable contribution to Ubuntu. We may not always agree, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behaviour and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. We expect members of the Ubuntu community to be respectful when dealing with other contributors as well as with people outside the Ubuntu project and with users of Ubuntu.

A example review might looks like this
<pre>
Rating: 4 out of 5 Starts
Summary: Good tax application with some quirks
The application is really good at calculating taxes, and even offers
a guided mode for helping new users. However some features like printing
are missing, so it only gets 4 stars.
