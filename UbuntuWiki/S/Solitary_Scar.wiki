'''Ubuntu 9.10 released!''' Ubuntu 9.10, codenamed Karmic Koala, is the next major release of the popular Ubuntu Linux distribution. Karmic is scheduled to arrive in October 29th 09, but developers can get an early look by testing the alpha release. Although Karmic is still at a very early stage of development, several major features have already arrived.

There are several major changes under the hood that users can look forward to in Karmic. Ext4, a new version of the standard Linux filesystem, is used by default for new installations. This is a step forward from Ubuntu 9.04, which only made Ext4 available as an option. Previous versions of Ext4 suffered from a controversial data corruption flaw and was not considered reliable enough for default use until now.

The alpha 2 release ships with GRUB 2, the next-generation of GNU's GRUB bootloader. It has been rewritten from scratch to deliver significantly greater flexibility and important features like localization support.

=== Desktop features ===

GNOME 2.28 featuring Empathy:  with this latest beta release, Ubuntu now
uses the Empathy instant messaging service by default, introducing the
Telepathy framework.

Ubuntu Software Center:  the first step in a replacement for Add/Remove
Software has landed for testing and feedback.

New boot experience:  multiple changes to look, feel and speed of
the boot experience have been included in the Ubuntu 9.10 beta.

=== Ekiga ===

Ekiga – the VoIP application that nobody uses – will finally be removed from the default installation. Not only did no-one use it (or anyone know of anyone else who used it), it also took up a considerable amount of disk space for what it was.

It will still be available to install from the repositories if you miss having it sat in your menu doing nothing.

=== Revamped Migration Assistant ===

The Migration Assistant usually found during an Ubuntu installation has been rewritten in Python to allow for greater development and maintainence. 
Controversially, it’s also been removed from the actual installer and instead placed under the ‘System’ menu of the Gnome Panel. This works fine for dual-boots, but if a user is totally replacing Windows with Ubuntu they’ll have no option to get migrate their data unless they boot to the desktop in the live CD first.

=== UbuntuOne ===

UbuntuOne – Canonical’s cloud storage service – will be included in Karmic, but any current beta users will find much deeper integration than currently available in Jaunty.

UbuntuOne in Karmic will be able to use/sync/share the following data between computers:

Files and folders <<BR>>
Screensharing <<BR>>
Evolution Contacts <<BR>>
Firefox Bookmarks <<BR>>
Notes <<BR>>
Another key feature of UbuntuOne in Karmic will be the option to share data with other computers via LAN. <<BR>>

=== WUBI ===

WUBI (Windows UBuntu Installer) will gain a ‘migration’ tool of it’s own that will allow existing WUBI installs to be transferred to their own dedicated partition – thus benefiting from faster performance.
 
When an Ubuntu CD is inserted in an existing WUBI install, it will detect it and ask the user if they wish to migrate their existing set-up or install a-fresh. Various options during the normal install process will be removed (such as presenting options to wipe/format entire disk) and (finally!!) fstab will be re-written from scratch during the migration.

=== Kubuntu features ===

Kubuntu 9.10, built on KDE 4.3, brings users a complete, full-featured KDE4
desktop with many new applications and innovations.

This is the first release for a new Kubuntu variant, Kubuntu Netbook Edition.
Built on a Kubuntu base, it brings users an exciting first look at KDE's 
netbook-oriented desktop environment.

=== Xubuntu features ===

Xubuntu 9.10 comes with the light-weight Xfce 4.6 desktop environment
to provide a desktop designed for productivity while conserving system
resources.

Xubuntu 9.10 is proud to offer an improved multimedia experience with
the Exaile media player, a more integrated power management solution
with the Xfce4 power manager, and more convenience built right in with
improved multimedia volume key support and more consistent desktop
notifications.
