This is a first draft of our development of the Snow White class of guardian server...

For a snow white class intall you need:

Pentium Class computer with
- 4 Gig hard drive
- 128 Megs RAM
- 2 Network Cards

Install will take place on a 

Dell "Pizza Box"
Optiplex GL 1 533
133 mHz Pentium 
10 Gig Hard Drive
64 Megs of ram.

for this system you will not run a GUI and will not need a mouse.

Turn off the GUI buy

Does ubuntu support floppy boot images?

It is identified by the port you plug it into.

The basic idea is that snow white is a bootable image that is downloaded on the "hot" (non ltsp) side.  

The special machine gets no X

The special machine gets the snow-white image from the LTSP server 

Snow white option can be turned on and off in a configuration file.

The forbidden list is mainted on the server
