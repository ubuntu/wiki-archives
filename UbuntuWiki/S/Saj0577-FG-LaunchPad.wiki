*** Code: source code hosting using the Bazaar version control system.
*** Bugs: a bug tracker, that allow users to publish bug in order that the developers team work on that.
*** Blueprints: This are new specifications, that are discuss and implemented on future versions of the projects.
*** Translations: this part allow user to translate projects into other languages
*** Answers:this part is for community support and knowledge base.
*** Personal profile and Groups: profiles are where Users put their personal info, list of groups that they join, Code of conduct signed, and project participation. And groups are where different Users join for a common end. (eg a LoCo team, translators for a language or a project developers)

Launchpad is free for all open source projects, but if the project is proprietary, that project should pay a fee in order to use Launchpad.
