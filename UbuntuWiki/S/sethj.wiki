=== About Me ===

I've been tinkering with Ubuntu since 9.10 and using it full time since 11.04. I enjoy programming and scripting as a hobby, although I'm not very good at either. Amateur CLI geek. I <3 Unity.

I also have <nowiki>[[http://keybase.io|keybase.io]]</nowiki> invites!

I'm an elected Moderator (♦) on Ask Ubuntu and user #53 by reputation (17.8k at time of writing). Some of my top answers include:

When I'm not on Ask Ubuntu answering questions, helping people in <nowiki>[[http://chat.stackexchange.com/?tab=site&host=askubuntu.com|chat]]</nowiki>, or doing janitorial work, I maintain the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~sethj/+archive/ubuntu/silentcast|Silentcast PPA]]</nowiki>, help out the Q/A team with ISO and package testing and more recently some bug management in the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BigDesktopBugScrub| Big Desktop Bug Scrub]]</nowiki> where I've processed over 50 bugs (so far).  

I've submitted 2 patches to packages in Ubuntu (hopefully with more to come!).

I have <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~sethj/+codesofconduct|signed]]</nowiki> the Ubuntu Code of Conduct.

=== Future Goals ===

==== Short term: ====

* Do more bug work! Right now any I manage to do is on a very ''make'' time for it approach due to school. I'm hoping to make some schedule changes soon that will allow me to devote more time to it.
 
* Do more testing! I have a bigger HDD now so I can devote a space just for the latest daily image which will makes things 10 times easier.

* Fix more bugs! Right now I'm looking at joining the papercuts team which seems like a good way to do that.

==== Long term: ====

* Do more packaging.

* Get involved in LoCo. No car currently so until then..

* I'd like to write software for Ubuntu Touch some day..

And somewhere in between is finish the Python app I am working on. I'm also attempting to fix the <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unity/+bug/1445595| empty trash bug]]</nowiki> in Unity.

 {*} sethj is one of these moderators that ''have'' a large hammer, but never have to actually get said hammer out of its holster as he gently coaches the users in the right direction, keeping his eyes on the long-term vision of the entire site. He cannot only herd cats, but make them walk in unison! -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:fabrizio-marana]]</nowiki>  

 {*} Seth is exceptional. I've been moderating on Ask Ubuntu somewhat longer but I'm in awe. Even after a gruelling 18 months, Seth ''still'' finds the energy to regularly and consistently chow through our the endless pile of flags. More than that, he has always been incredibly conscientious about his actions and interactions, actively deferring to experience when necessary, and keeping a balanced point of view throughout. These are traits we should want in every Ubuntu Member and I have no doubt Ubuntu will be stronger for having Seth as an official member. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:oli]]</nowiki> 
 {*} Seth is an amazing guy. He is constantly involved in the community, is almost always available to bounce questions off of in the Ask Ubuntu chat, and is really friendly - but isn't afraid to use his moderator powers if need be. He's usually available on Ask Ubuntu and is a common sight on the site, answering, editing, and reviewing questions. Seth definitely deserves the status of an official Ubuntu Member -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:aeves-nate]]</nowiki> 
 {*} I cannot recommend Seth highly enough for Ubuntu membership. He is an outstanding member of the Ubuntu community who is always looking for ways to help. As a moderator of Ask Ubuntu, he has put a tremendous amount of effort into processing flags and keeping things running smoothly. Seth isn't afraid to get his hands dirty learning new things. He is calm and patient when working with others and quick to provide encouragement. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:george-edison55]]</nowiki> 

 {*} I remember meeting Seth on Ask Ubuntu chat, back before he was a moderator. I remember asking if he was going to run in 2013, as he is well balanced in his views, also he doesn't loose his cool. Also, I hear he is helping to fix a #1 annoying trash bug. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:mateo-salta]]</nowiki> 
 {*} Seth manages to combine technical knowledge with seemingly endless patience. He has been a great help to many users on Ask Ubuntu and an exemplary moderator of the site. He is precisely the sort of person this community needs. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:terdon]]</nowiki> 
 {*} I learned to know Seth as one of the Ask Ubuntu moderators.In my opinion he is an extraordinary member regarding politeness and balance. He is has very good communication skills. He really is helpful concerning new users to getting started with the Ask Ubuntu platform-- -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:ravanasura93]]</nowiki> 
 {*} Being a fellow Ask Ubuntu moderator I am more than happy to endorse Seth's application to become a Ubuntu member.  His dedication to Ask Ubuntu, the site and its users is second to none.  His knowledge on all Ubuntu matters is renowned.  Very patient with the extraordinary varying types of users - from newbies to oldies.  He has filled the moderator role extremely well and is an exemplar to what Ubuntu really means "a quality that includes the essential human virtues; compassion and humanity." -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:fossfreedom]]</nowiki> 
 {*} Seth is very knowledgeable about Ubuntu, an enthusiastic learner, a good thinker, and an excellent moderator on Ask Ubuntu. He has a gift for working within a community and building cooperation. I have watched him defuse tangled, contentious disagreements on Ask Ubuntu while never losing his humor and great patience. And he's always responsive to pings and informal questions in chat. He would bring a lot to the community. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:echaskes]]</nowiki> 
 {*} As another of his fellow moderator at Ask Ubuntu, I have had great pleasure working with Seth. He is an incredible person, who simply happens to know what to do best at a given situation. His ability to handle difficult situations with relative ease and calmness is admirable. I wholeheartedly endorse his application for Ubuntu membership.	 -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:barneedhar]]</nowiki>
