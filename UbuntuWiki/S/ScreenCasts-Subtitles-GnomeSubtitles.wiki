== Gnome Subtitles ==

Home page: http://gnome-subtitles.sourceforge.net/

Written in Mono and GTK+, Gnome Subtitles supports most of the popular subtitle formats including Subrip, Advanced Sub Station Alpha and Subviewer. It uses <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MPlayer|MPlayer]]</nowiki> for an embedded preview window, but doen't take advantage of this feature as much as subtitle-editor does. In particular seeking can be difficult on larger videos and there is little support for previewing particular sections. 

=== Installation ===

Gnome Subtitles is not currently in any of the official Ubuntu repositories, though it is available from debian sid and there are packages on getdeb.net. You can also download the latest source code from the development website linked above.
