==== Notes ====

* Hi Albert, for all the none-working keys, can you fill in the key-codes from 'sudo showkey -u' run on the console, or the ACPI event from 'sudo tail -f /var/log/acpid', Many Thanks -PaulSladen

* Hi. The «sudo showkey -u» command is currently not showing any output for Fn+F2 to Fn+F5 and Fn+F7 - BjornIngeBerg

All of the functions of the touchpad work as intended, allthough the "feel" is very much improved if you install a Synaptics driver like this one: http://web.telia.com/~u89404340/touchpad/
