=== How to summarize your meeting ===

==== with MootBot ====
 ''follow <nowiki>[[ScribesTeam/SubmitMeeting]]</nowiki> first''
# Ensure the summary and log files generated by mootbot are posted on the page you gave for the agenda link.
# Ensure that the <code>Category<YourTeam></code> is at the bottom of the agenda.
# Fill in the list of participants (should be provided in the log soon)
# For each summary topic create a link to the corresponding log topic. (eg. `}}}<nowiki>[[`Anchor(target)]]</nowiki>`<code> `just above the topic in the log. {{{[#target topic]</code> around the topic in the summary)
# For each point on the agenda, pull together any [ACTION], [AGREED] and [LINK] tags into a text summary.

==== without MootBot ====
# Create a page for your Team's meeiting on MeetingLogs under your Team or ``Lo``Co name using this <nowiki>[[ScribesTeam/MeetingTemplate|template]]</nowiki>. (eg <code>MeetingLogs/<YourTeam>/<yyyymmdd></code>) Alternatively, if your Team or ``Lo``Co has a seperate site, create a similar structure there and use the same template.
# Place your Team's Agenda, Summary and Log under the appropriate sections on the page.
# Follow steps 2 through 4 under ''with ``Moot``Bot''.
