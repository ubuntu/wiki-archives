__TOC__

I am Ian Scott, age 13.  I live in California, and only use Ubuntu, for now at least.  That is partially because I lost my Windows 7 installation when I installed Ubuntu, but I have not been very unhappy about that.  I have programmed in C++ and created Debian packages, but I am still learning.
