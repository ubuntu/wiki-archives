__TOC__


When ever possible we maintain Sugar packages in Debian's Alioth. Every SugarTeam member is also a Debian OLPC maintainer on Alioth, and SugarTeam members have the rights to push Debian/Ubuntu-spesific fixes upstream. During a freeze, or when we must diverge, we have the full expectation to merge at the next appropriate juncture.
