__TOC__

I've been a user of Ubuntu since Warty was released. My user name on ubuntuforums.org is "mostwanted".

==== Current goals for community participation ====

Participate in writing documentation, possibly artwork creation too.

==== Past contributions ====

I've created one fairly popular guide for Ubuntu called "How to install ANYTHING in Ubuntu!" (http://htmldesign.dk/blog3/ubuntu/installing/). I'm currently in the process of refitting this document for Ubuntu 7.10. I've also previously done some translations into Danish on launchpad, as well as submitting a few bugs.
