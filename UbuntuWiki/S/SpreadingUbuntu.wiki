__TOC__

This is a list of basic concepts you can use in order to help Ubuntu propagate in your local community. Provided by the Marketing Team - Discuss at www.ubuntupeople.com

* The obvious activity of convincing friends, showing them LiveCD sessions, helping them switch. (Mentioned for completeness)

* Talk to local hardware vendors... such as the notebook shop around the corner, anh try to convince them to do either of the following:
 Hand out CDs with sold PCs, especially blank ones.
 Hand out CDs along with a contact to you for installation and support (feel free to charge fair prices if you don't feel like doing it for free)
 Preinstall Ubuntu on machines to save on OEM licenses, charge the customer, who still saves a heap

* Inform HW vendors and manufacturers that their product works with GNU/Linux

* Passive Marketing: Posters at your school etc., CD stands, stickers...
