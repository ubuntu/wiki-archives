=== Current Issues ===

'''Currently testing with Gutsy Tribe 3 (LiveCD only). Issues include:'''

* Sometimes hangs on boot when loading live-cd. Hung once while loading "hardware drivers" and twice when booting into X. Once the screen went blank (as if on standby) and when I moved the mouse the background was present but shortly thereafter the mouse froze and never recovered. All hangs could only be resolved by hard reset.
* Occasionally while mousing or typing it looks like a screen brightness status screen comes up and goes away after about a second or so. I was not able to recreate this problem.
* No accelerated 3d. This feature was working under Feisty with both Compiz and Beryl (albeit slow on the open-source radeon driver).
* DPI was not properly detected by Xorg. It was set too low and the fonts were too small.  (I saw this was being addressed on Launchad, so this isn't such an issue currently).

==== Notes ====

I've noticed that once Ubuntu/Kubuntu is installed via text install and reboots, the drive will eventually corrupt and become unusable.  I've figured out that adding 'ide=nodma' has cleared this up for this notebook.  (Be sure to add it to the /boot/grub/menu.list file at the end of the 'defoptions', 'altoptions' and the current 'kernel' lines.)

Will keep updating this page.
