__TOC__

I'm one of many Aussies in Europe, a CTO and Web 2.0, SaaS, <nowiki>[[http://google.com/enterprise/|Google Enterprise]]</nowiki>, Citrix, Microsoft and Security (CISSP) guy.

I've done a bunch of stuff with Linux dating back to the mid-nineties (including distro development, clustering, embedded development, kernel coding and one of the first large enterprise installs).

I sporadically post to a blog at <nowiki>[[http://samj.net/]]</nowiki> and occasionally log in to social networks including LinkedIn (<nowiki>[[http://www.linkedin.com/in/samjohnston/]]</nowiki>).

I contribute to a bunch of community based projects like:
* CAcert (<nowiki>[[http://cacert.org/]]</nowiki>)
* Debian (<nowiki>[[http://debian.org/]]</nowiki>)
* Ubuntu (<nowiki>[[http://ubuntu.org/]]</nowiki>)

I've launched a handful of technology companies and run a consulting firm called Australian Online Solutions (http://www.aos.net.au/) for over a decade which services large businesses around the globe.
