==== The Anecdote ====
When I was a kid, we had one of these things hanging outside, an eerie blue light called a "bug zapper". Some bugs were hopelessly draw to it, would fly into the light, and be electrocuted, leaving a nasty smell of ozone behind.

I see nowadays there's a more proactive approach -- an electrically charged tennis racket, also called a "bug zapper":

For many server packages in Ubuntu, we simply wait around for bugs to be fixed. Sometimes they get fixed upstream. Sometimes someone drives by and drops off a patch. It's like waiting for the bugs to hurl themselves at the blue light.

=== Release Note ===

During Beta1 and Beta2, the Ubuntu Server Community triaged and fixed XXX bugs during a concentrated push to solidify several sets of key server packages (foo, bar, baz).

=== Rationale ===

Given Lucid's LTS status, we should take a more proactive approach to fixing Ubuntu Server bugs.  We should arm a platoon of Ubuntu Server Developers and Community Members with electric rackets, and send them out on timed, coordinated missions, focusing all efforts on a particular package or group of packages for about a week at a time.

== Assumptions == 

Some care needs to be taken around freezes. Also, it would be helpful to get participation from the QA team as well as the community.

=== History ===

As an example, several members of the Server Team and Community focused on fixing Eucalyptus bugs (and only Eucalyptus bugs) for a short period. In October 2009, we uploaded the Ubuntu eucalyptus package 10 times, fixing 60 bugs.

==== Plan ====

* Monday - total bug triage
** prioritize all bugs according to a defined formula for that package, generally:
** '''Critical''' = data loss, corruption, or serious security problem
** '''High''' = totally prevents the package from functioning, workarounds impractical
** '''Medium''' = most bugs, non-ideal behavior, perhaps workarounds prevent from being 'high'
** '''Low''' = other bugs, with workarounds, affecting fewer users
** '''Wishlist''' = cosmetic, feature requests, nice-to-have's
** confirm/reproduce any bugs in the "new" state
** triage any bugs in the confirmed state, ie, identify the problem, test workarounds or solutions
** expire any bugs that are invalid
** fix-release any bugs that cannot be reproduced on the latest code
** assign yourself (or others) triaged bugs that they can fix
** time permitting, start working on fixes
* Tuesday
** bzr branch the latest lucid code
** work on fixes, pushing to lp:~yourname/thepackage/bugnumber
** build a package in your PPA for testing
** get some else to verify your PPA build
** uploader will roll all fixes into an upload for that day
* Wednesday
** same as Tuesday
* Thursday
** same as Tuesday, rolling toward a "final" release by the end of the day
* Friday
** Comprehensive regression testing
** Generate status report on total uploads, bugs triaged, bugs fixed, participation
** Post to ubuntu-server@ mailing list, ubuntu-server blog

==== Details ====

* Communication will take place IRC at #ubuntu-server
* Development will be done in Bazaar/Launchpad
* Builds will be published for testing in PPAs
