==== Notes ====

Older laptop, but makes a nice laptop for the basics. I recommend upgrading it to 256mb ram. Runs Gnome fine, and runs XFCE great.

I use a Orinoco pcmcia card for wireless and it works great.

I have also used a Netgear 32bit Cardbus 10/100 wired nic (FA511) also works great.

Uses APM instead of ACPI for battery monitoring
