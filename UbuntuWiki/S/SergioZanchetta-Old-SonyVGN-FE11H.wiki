=== Current Issues ===
* Issues with power Management
* ACPI is broken ! No way to change brightness, it seems chipset is different from FS Series, where it works... Please update this page to provide a link to a solution if it exists, currently brightness is maximum and just sucks my battery at lightspeed. Or send me an email to xavier.verne@free.fr, I'll update it.
* A workaround for this problem consists in installing smartdimmer, a CLI utility, which enables to adjust brightness...Battery test without and with brightness corrected to do !
* Gnome power management doesn't give correct values : time remaining indicated is not reliable : it CHANGES all the time ! From one read to another it goes from 42mn to 2h 10, through 1h, all in 5mn and 2% battery later.
* Issues with Special Fn Keys
* Fn Key don't work, same issue as ACPI. /proc/acpi/sony could expose Fn Keys to capture events as with other VAIO
* S1 and S2 special don't work anymore. Previous Flight 5 mapping is lost : AFAIK, this looks like a regression
* Issues with sound
* Microphone does not work. (see <nowiki>[[#microphone_fix|How to get  microphone working]]</nowiki>)

==== Notes ====

===== How to get microphone working =====
1. Make sure that you've installed the headers for your linux-kernel and the necessary compiler tools. Do this by installing the linux-headers and the build-essential package.
2. Download the newest alsa-drivers from http://www.alsa-project.org/ (I used alsa-driver v1.0.13rc3).
3. Unpack the alsa-drivers.
4. Open console and go into directory of the unpacked alsa-drivers.
5. Configure, compile and install the driver:
  <pre>
  ./configure --with-cards=hda-intel
  make
  sudo make install
  </pre>
6. Reboot your machine.

UPDATE : With Gutsy GIbbon, Microphone is working out of the box, from scratch. I've just recorded some analog output via the line-in microphone with audacity ! Just rocks.
