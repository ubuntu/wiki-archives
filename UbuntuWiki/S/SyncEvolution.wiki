The graphical user interface is in a separated package: sync-ui

<nowiki>[[http://www.estamos.de/projects/SyncML|SyncEvolution]]</nowiki> has not been included in Ubuntu yet. Someone started packaging it and created this page, but didn't complete that work. In the meantime, .deb packages which work on Debian and Ubuntu are released by the upstream project. See http://www.estamos.de/projects/SyncML/Installation.html
