I've been through a couple of distros (RH, SuSE, Debian), even build a Linux from scratch back in 2005 http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/, going back to Debian and finally discovered Ubuntu (breezy), '''that was it !'''  :) 

I stick to Ubuntu since then, today with "Gutsy" on a Toshiba R400 Notebook which came originally with Vista Prof. ... well I don't know how to use Redmond's stuff since about 9 years now. It was a minimalistic time in the beginning but ever since Ubuntu came up the situation is continuously changing.

"Gutsy" actually installs and runs on a Notebook totally tailored for Redmond's newest OS.
The R400 is a tablet Notebook which comes with Touchscreen and Handwriting capabilities, something I couldn't get to run yet.
Ah and I didn't manage it yet to build a custom kernel which actually boots, although I was used to do so now and then on all my previous Notebooks (Portege 2000, R100, R200). Here it simply doesn't seem to work. Hope I will figure that one out by time.
