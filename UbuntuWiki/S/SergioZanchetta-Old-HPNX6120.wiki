==== Notes ====

==== Ubuntu 6.06 and above ====

# Modem: In order to get it working, you need to install the package '''''sl-modem-daemon''''', which is in Ubuntu multiverse.
# Card Reader: Card reader is identified. But it is not tested on Ubuntu 6.06. Read next point to know how it works on Ubuntu 6.10. It may be helpful
# Following procedure is tested only with a SD card and on Ubuntu 6.10. It may defer for other cards or on Ubuntu 6.06.
** Load driver.
   <pre>
sudo modprobe tifm_sd
</pre>
   (The driver's .ko file is under /lib/modules/2.6.17-11-generic/kernel/drivers/mmc/)
** Insert the card in card reader.
** Verify that device is recognised. Open System->Administration->Device Manager. Under 'PCIxx21 Integrated FlashMedia' you should be able to see the device.
** If you see the device note the device/partition addresses from 'Advanced' tab. In my case addresses are, device - /dev/mmcblk0, partition - /dev/mmcblk0p1
** Mount the partition using pmount
   <pre>
pmount /dev/mmcblk0p1
</pre>
** The card gets mounted in directory /media/mmcblk0p1. A desktop entry is created. The card is also accessible form Places->Removable Media or Places->Computer
** If the card is straight out of camera then you will be asked if you want to import the photos.
** To avoid loading driver every time before inserting the card add tifm_sd to /etc/modules
