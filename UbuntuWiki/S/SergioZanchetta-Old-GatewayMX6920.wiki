==== Notes ====
===== TI card reader =====
'''Fix''' on Edgy:
<pre>
sudo gedit /etc/modules
</pre>
Add these lines:
<pre>
tifm_core
tifm_7xx1
tifm_sd</pre>

===== Soundcard =====

sometimes you boot and it won't have any sound at all until the next boot (might take a few to bring it back)
Sound works fine on Feisty

'''Fix''' (or workaround) which works on Edgy (someone please test on Dapper)
<pre>
sudo gedit /etc/modules
</pre>
Add this:
<pre>
options snd-hda-intel model=m2-2
</pre>

===== Wired internet =====
The driver's not very good and dies at high throughput, but there's no fix for it.  All you can do when it happens is 
<pre>
sudo rmmod sky2
sudo modprobe sky2</pre>
