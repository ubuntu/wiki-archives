=== Current Issues (as of Ubuntu 8.10) ===

Will need to run 'xrandr --output LVDS --set BACKLIGHT_CONTROL native' at startup to make brightness controls work.

Front speakers will not automatically switch off when plugin in headphones. Can be switched of manually.

cannot change touchpad speed ? (untested for 8.10)

Everything else works out-of-the-box and is fully functional.

== Issues with Ubuntu 7.04
CPU frequency scaling unsupported (but works if you sudo modprobe p4-clockmod)

brightness control unsupported

desktop effects don't work out of the box (you can enable typing "
SKIP_CHECKS=yes compiz --replace" (doesn't change any setting in your system; CTRL+C in the terminal, or restarting your computer will bring everything as it was), and they work fine. but then you have to disable them to watch video. it's a compatibility issue with intel x3100)

suspend and hibernate do not work out of the box. they work with uswsusp, though. (actually only "s2both" works, and it hibernates)
