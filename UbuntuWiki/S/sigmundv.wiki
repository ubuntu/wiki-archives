== About Me ==

I'm known as '''sigmundv''' around here. My nickname is modelled after my real name, Sigmund Vestergaard. I'm 32 years old and have an MScEng degree in Applied Mathematics.

I started using Ubuntu in 2005, when some mates in college told me about it. If I remember correctly 5.04 was the first release I used and I was hooked immediately, because it was much more pleasant for me to use than Windows XP, which I was using at the time. No GUI tool out there can be compared to the command line. Instead of poking round with menus and checkboxes you write a line in a terminal and get the work done. This was the chief reason why I stayed with Linux and am still in love with it.

I was looking to get involved in an open source project where I could make a difference, and I saw that Ubuntu GNOME needed people to help out, so I'm joining them for now. I am a GNOME user myself and feel that people wanting to use Ubuntu and GNOME should be able to install a stable desktop that gives a good experience with both, and by participating in the Ubuntu GNOME I can help achieving this.
