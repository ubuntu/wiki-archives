__TOC__

I have worked for <nowiki>[[http://www.canonical.com/|Canonical]]</nowiki> as a <nowiki>[[http://www.python.org/|Python]]</nowiki> developer and <nowiki>[[http://www.postgresql.org|PostgreSQL]]</nowiki> database administrator since 2004, primarily on the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/|Launchpad]]</nowiki> project. The rubber ducky is all my fault.

I am <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~stub|stub]]</nowiki> on Launchpad.

Most of my contributions to Ubuntu have been indirect, working on Launchpad which helps build Ubuntu, being the author of software that other people package, Ubuntu specific troubleshooting in upstream forums, filing and tracking down bugs etc.

My other Open Source work has been lost in the mists of time, although I still maintain the <nowiki>[[http://pytz.sourceforge.net/|pytz]]</nowiki> timezone library for Python and my contributions to Python and Zope are still in active use.

More details are on my out of date <nowiki>[[http://stuartbishop.net|home page]]</nowiki>.
