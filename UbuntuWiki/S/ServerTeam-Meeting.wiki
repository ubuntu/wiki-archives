The Ubuntu Server Team holds public office hours, usually on Tuesdays from 16:00 UTC to 17:00 UTC in <code>#ubuntu-server</code> on Freenode.  Bug report discussion is welcome on the bug report or in <code>#ubuntu-server</code> on Freenode at any time, but this time is set aside as focused time to put on the calendar each week.
