=== Other Examples ===

* Brought Test Driven Development into the Compiz project
* Read and adhere to most of the principles in Working With Legacy Code, Clean Code, C++ Coding Standards, Effective C++, More Effective C++ etc
* Worked with graphics optimization tools such as gDebugger
* Worked with code coverage tools such as lcov

=== Extra Note ===

Even though I did work on compiz during my employment at Canonical, I do not wish to be placed back on to the compiz project.

1. I already have commit access and plan to maintain bits of it anyways
2. There are much better things that I could be working on
