A commercial application which has a few unique features amongst the pack. When started DemoRecorder opens a new window containing an entire desktop session. Some simple controls are provided for controlling the recording, saving and playback of videos. DemoRecorder records only what is within that session. So unlike other screen recording applicaions which are recorders only, DemoRecorder prepares the necessary session to be recorded.
