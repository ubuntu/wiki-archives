=== Summary ===

Kourou is a great launcher, but loses some features, such as displaying backgrounds. This specification is to discuss what features to implement in Kourou, as well as other launcher ideas we should develop.

=== Release Note ===

Users may now set background images on Ubuntu MID, and the launcher now has configurable menus and improved finger navigation support.

=== Rationale ===

Kourou's functionality isn't complete and should be improved and finished in other places

=== Use Cases ===

* Alice uses Ubuntu Mobile, and uses Kourou to access all the applications on the device.

=== Design ===

==== Possible Alternatives ====

* Use UNR launcher? (likely not possible since there is a lot of HW out there not having GL and/or composite support)
* Matchbox panel could be considered as a replacement, it's usage model is far from being intuituve though.
* UNR is already going to need to create a GTK+ frontend for their launcher.  MID can steal that/the backend.  The UNR launcher is well-tested/already-deployed.

==== Kourou enhancement brainstorming ====
* Add finger scrolling
* Replace Marquee category selections
* Add "search for application" feature ?
* New "favorites" menu category
* Startup effects/notification
* Icon reordering by finger (drag/drop support)
* Zoom in/out
* Add configurable icon/fontsize gconf options
* Inspect possible other input methods (jogdial, blackberry pebble, virtua onscreen trackball ...)
* Use a context menu on longtouch events for "hide", "move", "delete" etc.
* Add additional view modes, i.e. "ListView"
* Icons that show state (like the Dates icon showing current date?)#
* possibly some sorta file view?
* Implement a "Recently used" category for documents

==== Selected Final Feature List ====

* Background Image support
* Finger Scrolling
* StartupNotification support
* Menu Editing

=== Implementation ===

==== UI Changes ====

TBD

==== Code Changes ====

TBD

=== Test/Demo Plan ===

Add a kourou-specific testcase that exercises the 4 selected feature improvements to the TestCases for image testing, and test alongside milestone image testing.

=== Unresolved issues ===

* Kourou currently doesn't support wallpaper setting due to a bug in GtkIconview (no widget transparency), either GtkIconview needs fixing or Kourou needs to use a table of buttons or similar.
* Would it help to have a Gtk front-end to the UNR launcher? A lot of time and effort (with *lots* of testing) has already gone into the codebase. A new front-end would not be difficult.

=== BoF agenda and discussion ===
