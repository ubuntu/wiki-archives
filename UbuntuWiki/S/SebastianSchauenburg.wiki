In my spare time, I work (I own a very small company), try to do some FOSS advocacy and be a part of the Ubuntu(-NL) community. 

=== Ubuntu activities ===

* '''2005-04''' Hoary Hedgehog release! The 'real' beginning of Linux on my desktop, thanks to Ubuntu. A friend helped me out, since I had some issues installing/configuring. 
* '''2005-07''' (IRC) Started to help out on the #Ubuntu-NL IRC channel once in a while. This once in a while turned into even more often as time passed on.
* '''2005-10''' (meeting) Some members of the Dutch LoCo-team met at Linux World 2005 in Utrecht and I was also there. It was quite nice to have an actual conversation with eachother and ofcourse talk about Linux related stuff.
* '''2006-06''' (advocacy) Dapper Drake release! This was my personal turning point and now I was confident enough to point Ubuntu out to fellow students, Describe SebastianSchauenburg here.family and co-workers. I can not sell or recommend bad products, because that's not the kind of person I am. Anyway, now my FOSS/Ubuntu advocacy really got off the ground.
* '''2006-07-08''' (<nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NLSummermeeting2006|meeting]]</nowiki>) The Dutch LoCo-team held a Summermeeting, which I attended and helped to organize, as far as there was something to organize. We ended up sitting in the sun at a cafe having a couple of drinks. Afterwards we had dinner together and talking about Ubuntu and other related subjects almost all the time.
* '''2006-10''' (education) In the last year of my study (Computer Sciences) we got to choose two courses (out of twenty) and I chose "Linux" and "Open Source and Open Standards". I even got the chance to be the teacher of my fellow students. I took the oppertunity, since I didn't think the teacher was very competent with regards to Linux. I had to create course material for a course that lasted 10 weeks, which resulted in 8 presentations. In addition to the course material I had to attend and lead the workshops.<<BR>> ''Note'': Before I took the 'job' I had only one demand: I want to use Ubuntu and not Fedora, which was pre-installed on the machines. Eventually I was known among my fellow students as "the Ubuntu guy".
 I still have to publicize the sheets, but I will need to find out the (copyright) laws which have to do with using brand names and screenshots. 
* '''2006-10''' (education) The other course I chose was "Open Source and Open Standards" at which I was asked to give a short Linux presentation. Also this presentation was a bit Ubuntu colored, since I also had some CD's to pass out.
* '''2006-12''' (forum) I started to get more active on the Ubuntu-NL forums to help people out. I didn't think a lot of people would use the forums, but I was wrong. Apparently IRC still scares a lot of people away, it's a shame.
* '''2007-02-03''' (<nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NlWinterMeeting2007|meeting]]</nowiki>) I helped organising the Ubuntu-NL WinterMeeting, which was held in The Hague. The meeting was mostly about getting some feedback/input of the Dutch Ubuntu users. The meeting somehow attracted about 40 people from all over the Netherlands and Belgium. Some were new to Ubuntu, some had a lot more experience and some people just wanted to have their say in things. Afterwards I can only say that the day was a success!
* '''2007-02-24/25''' (<nowiki>[[http://www.fosdem.org/2007/|meeting]]</nowiki>) Together with the Belgian LoCo-team we took care of the Ubuntu booth at FOSDEM. It was quite some work setting up the booth, but breaking it down went blazingly fast.
* '''2007-04-02''' (PR) I held a presentation, demonstration and QA session in Steenbergen, with the local computer club. They are basically Windows oriented, but they got a glimpse of Ubuntu and hopefully they will convert.
* '''2007-12''' Officially became team leader (and afterwards one of the team leaders).
* '''2008-02-23''' (<nowiki>[[http://www.fosdem.org/2008/|meeting]]</nowiki>) Together with the Belgian LoCo-team we took care of the Ubuntu booth at FOSDEM. Unfortunately I didn't have a lot of time this year.
* '''2008-05-03''' Gave a presentation and helped out a bit at the Hardy release party in Herk-de-Stad (Ubuntu-BE)
* '''2008-05-17''' Gave a presentation and helped out a bit at the Hardy release party in Amsterdam (Ubuntu-NL)

=== Non-Ubuntu activities ===
* I don't know how long I've had my Debian server at home, but I still have it and it still works. I can't imagine what I would do without my 350Mhz server. This server started my Debian addiction and later on turned it into an Ubuntu addiction.
* '''2005-12''' (<nowiki>[[http://www.winehq.org/|Wine]]</nowiki>) Since I didn't have a lot of free time on my hands and a lot of time to learn the coding, I decided to help the Wine project in a very simpel way. Every week I used to run the regression testing packages on the Windows machines I was using. After a while I was also helping out some people in #WineHQ who mostly had basic questions.
* '''2006-01''' (<nowiki>[[http://www.zwhlug.org/|LUG]]</nowiki>) A friend of mine and myself started the Zuid-West Hoek Linux User Group. We also got a wiki running which is a place for us to post some helpfull howto's or just some useful notes. Unfortunately we still hav about 3 members, but they're a great bunch. On another note; it's a fun thing to do and the ZWHLUG meetings are a great excuse to go to the pub once a month.

=== Plans and ideas for Ubuntu ===

'''Near future''':<<BR>>
* (Users) Hopefully the number of Ubuntu users will increase even more and everyone will get a satisfactory knowledge level. I don't expect everyone to turn into a kernel hacker, but that everyone will at least know the basics.

'''Far future''':<<BR>>
Nothing big planned yet, that I can talk about. It wouldn't be the first time that the Open Source world would be full of surprises. So I want to keep my goals quite short term, but keep the big long-term goals in mind. Ofcourse I hope we get a bigger market share than Microsoft, get the game developers to use OpenGL instead of DirectX/Direct3D and get the 'Open Standards' thought into everyone's mind. How many of these idealistic dreams will actually be realized can't be foretold. Time will tell.

=== Endorsements ===

Sebastian is very active in the dutch Lo``Coteam, trying to get things moving. I enjoy working with him on things like fosdem and Ubuntu NL. - DennisKaarsemaker 

Good guy. -- MarkVandenBorre

I met Sebastian for the first time on the Ubuntu Wintermeeting in The Netherlands. He hosted the event because DennisKaarsemaker wasn't available at the time. He did a very good job. I also spoke to Sebastian at FOSDEM in Belgium, where we organized the Ubuntu booth at FOSDEM with a few others. It was fun working with him on promoting Ubuntu. -- WesleyStessens
