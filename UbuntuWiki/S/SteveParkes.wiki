10 years of Linux Use, 5 years of Debian use, a couple of months of Ubuntu under my belt ;-)

Spent the last ten years being variously a software engineer, a linux consultant, a web developer and even an IT lecturer at a local college.  Wants Linux to dominate the world and doesn't make a secret of it thinks Ubuntu is a great introduction to Linux for new users but has all the power of debian making it perfect for experienced and power users as well.  

Random made up quote for the wiki "The revolution will not be televised but it will be well documented ;-)"
