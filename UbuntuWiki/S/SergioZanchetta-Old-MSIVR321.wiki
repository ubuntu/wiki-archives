==== Notes ====

Needed to install via proprietary drivers from instructions given on this page for the NC20
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NC20

Then added my own xorg.conf file, that I found on a different page (now forgotten) also about the NC20.  The 2 xorg.conf files referenced on the above page do NOT work for me.
