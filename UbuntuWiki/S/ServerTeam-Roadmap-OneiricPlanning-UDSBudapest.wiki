__TOC__

=== Notable Decisions and Planned Changes ===
==== Best OS for the Cloud ====
* Adding ARM as a supported architecture
* OpenStack will be the default cloud infrastructure stack for Ubuntu Server, replacing Eucalyptus
* '''Both''' OpenStack "Diablo" and Eucalyptus 3.0 will be in main
* Moving to a 2-stage install experience
  1. Minimal set of steps/packages required to boot a Server on CD
** Optional configuration/deployment via Orchestra components
* ''Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud'' is now '''''Ubuntu Cloud'''''
* Detailed boot messaging enabled by default, i.e. remove "quiet" from default grub options
* We will replace ntpdate with ntpd in Ubuntu Server
==== Best OS in the Cloud ====
* Ensemble will be in universe
* byobu on by default in cloud images
=== Session Blueprints ===
----
~+Blueprint:+~ UbuntuSpec:server-o-arm-server
==== Action Items ====
* Look at adding shipping seed to the headless image - if the server is not on a network, won't install because there is no shipping seed
* Investigate hot plug support
* Use OpenStack for ARM + LXC
* OEM-config runs on the serial console, needs a switch to appear on serial AND/OR console
* Select platform for ARM server release:
** OMAP3 beagleboard XM
** OMAP4 pandaboard 
** Look at ARM Versatile Express
* Preseed, vs unpack and boot (which format)
* Have a proper debian installer 
* Need to have both netboot + preinstall (headless) + bootfloppy
** 'bootfloppy' has different definition based on platform
* JAVA - dependencies on openJDK, getting java working better on ARM
** ARM java VM's are optimized for client, need to be optimised for enterprise/server
** IST project has ARM support
* Investigate Landscape/Smart issues
* Network filesystems for diskless boot must be tested and supported - NFS (with and without RAMdisK), iSCSI, NDB, AFS(?), CEPH, GFS2, PVFS, RAID, LVM
* Orchestra tie-ins will need to be tested
* Investigate the ability to support bonding and bridging networking (TUN/TAP/802.1q/VLAN/VPN/IPv6/IPsec)
* Investigate interpreted/compiled languages that have Server dependencies:
** Erlang
** python
** Ruby (Rails?)
* Automated testing on ARM platforms needs to be done.
* Server team test cases need to be looked at.
* LAMP stack testing
* Crypto acceleration in kernel
** urandom, random, random number 
** entropy keys
* 32 vs 64 bit
* gnuTLS, SSL, etc need to be validated
* AppArmor on ARM, it's not validated yet on ARM
** toolchain, check that hardening is being called (Case)
** memory randomization
* toolchain, 64 bit atomics are missing in GCC 4.5
* System Management Tools!!
* Net install needs works on OMAP4
** Calxeda will provide a PXE boot patch for u-boot

* cloud-init should be treated as the "configuration management bootloader", i.e., the gateway to being managed by puppet/chef/ensemble/rightscale/etc
* initial pxe boot image on the network should be a "collect data and report it" image.  Then, when a new system is plugged into the network it will boot that image, and report back its mac and cpu/meminfo/disk...

* hardware configuration
* test squid deb proxy pre-existance (scenario with 2 servers)
* add wrapper for cobbler that works/looks/feels/acts like the ec2 api
