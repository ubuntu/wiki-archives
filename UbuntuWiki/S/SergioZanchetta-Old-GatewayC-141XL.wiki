=== Current Issues ===

'''Ubuntu 8.10 Intrepid Ibex:'''

Integrated wireless is only recognized once the computer has been running for a while then restarted.

Stylus and tablet mode buttons do not work on install.

Screen rotation works out of the box with through the provided "Screen Resolution" (''System>Preferences>Screen Resolution'') application, which is only a front end for xrandr, but is very slow. 

Proprietary "fglx" driver has better 3D support, but does not support rotation.

Not able to test Modem functionality. 

=== Solutions/ Work Arounds ===

'''Xorg:''' <nowiki>[[attachment:xorg.txt]]</nowiki>

Copy the text of this file and save it to "/etc/X11/xorg.conf". 
Since the C-141XL was a non customizable selection, this should work on all machines. It gives full support for the Wacom Stylus and 3D and rotation functionality. This configuration uses the Open "ati" video driver. To speed up rotated/ inverted screen configurations, the "EXA" Acceleration option is enabled. 

'''Rotation:''' <nowiki>[[attachment:rotation.txt]]</nowiki>

Copy the text of this file and save it to "/home/USERNAME/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts/rotation.sh".
Replace "USERNAME" with the username you log in under. Once saved, right click the file, select "Properties", click the "Permissions" tab, check "Allow executing file as program", and click "Close". This will give you an option in your right click menu to rotate your screen. It is required to rotate your stylus orientation along with the visual orientation of your screen.

'''Stylus Calibration:'''

For stylus calibration you will need to install the "wacom-tools" and "xserver-xorg-input-wacom" packages. To do this, open terminal and type: 

<code>sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-input-wacom wacom-tools</code>

After this is installed you can use the command: <code>wacomcpl</code> to calibrate your stylus.

This configuration should work on the C-142 and C-143 models as well since the only change between models was from 3GB RAM to 4GB RAM and including the Vista Service Packs by default.
