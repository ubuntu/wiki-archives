Hey dear friends of Linux and Ubuntu!

The latest release of Ubuntu, 7.10, also known as the Gutsy Gibbon, is out !!!

To celebrate it's birthday, the Ubuntu Swiss Team will organize a Release Party in the same vein as we did for the Feisty Fawn.
The party will take place at the Puzzle offices in Bern on Saturday 10th November, starting from 14:00 till midnight.

Find the list of activities and any other useful information you may need at: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SwissTeam/ReleasePartyGutsy
or ask directly on IRC #ubuntu-ch (on irc.freenode.net).

Looking forward to see you at the party!
