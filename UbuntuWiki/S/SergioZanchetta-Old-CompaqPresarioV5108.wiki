=== Current Issues ===

As noted by others: hibernate is unreliable. First wake seems to always work, but subsequent "wakes" may cold-boot instead.

Suspend does not work (locks up).

3D acceleration works with latest update (kernel 2.15.6-26), but not base Dapper.

Wireless does not work with dapper install. The How-To http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=197102&page=3&highlight=ndiswrapper+howto works for me, AFTER kernel updates (as of 2007.02.15). I used both network-manager-gnome and wifi-radar (they interact a bit). "ifdown" no longer works from the comand line (a network-manager-gnome issue?).

Wireless named eth1 instead of wlan0 (see fix). Also fixed by the how-to above.

==== Notes ====

Builtin wifi (802.11b/g) is recognized, and driver loaded. But it does not associate with my 802.11b. 'iwlist eth1 scan' returns "unsupported." See http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=197102&page=3&highlight=ndiswrapper+howto to fix (with kernel updates).

Following <nowiki>[[WifiDocs-Driver-bcm43xx]]</nowiki>, the wifi will associate on boot (if /etc/network/interfaces has `auto eth1`), but never again after ifdown. Scanning works, and continues to work. Used /usr/share/bcm43xx-fwcutter/install_bcm43xx_firmware.sh to get firmware. If no `auto eth1`, then scanning doesn't seem to work.

Following <nowiki>[[WifiDocs-Driver-bcm43xx-Dapper]]</nowiki> does not improve the situation (the only difference from above is it gives a firmware url to use, which is different than the one chosen by /usr/share/bcm43xx-fwcutter/install_bcm43xx_firmware.sh. Also tried with the driver-cab from hp <nowiki>[[ftp:--ftp.hp.com-pub-softpaq-sp31001-31500-sp31463.exe|sp31463.exe]]</nowiki> from page http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareList?lc=en&cc=us&dest_page=product&product=499847&dlc=en&os=228

Trying ndiswrapper, by following http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=201902 (and reboot): `ifconfig eth1 up` gives `no such device`. Clearer instructions on http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=25683 (but consider the /etc/network/interfaces and/or the order of iwconfig commands).

There is a claim that the 4318 chipset will not work with the bcm43xx driver (tx power/noise): http://bcm43xx.spugna.org/index.php?topic=110 . But, I don't have that message in dmesg.

wifi fixed: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=197102&page=3&highlight=ndiswrapper+howto

I expected the laptop to have a PCMCIA slot, but it has none. Instead, a compaq special slot ("fast"?).

Need to test the fix to rename eth1 to wlan0 (http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=201902) (fixed by the wifi how-to fix).
