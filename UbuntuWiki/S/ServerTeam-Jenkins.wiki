| '''Title'''
| '''Description'''
| '''Workaround'''
| '''Fix'''
|-
| Missing Libraries
| Because the base distribution does not include the normal plugins which upstream bundle, some other plugins fail due to missing libraries
| 
| 
|-
| openid
| required commons-httpclient which is pulled in my the maven plugin build to Jenkins core.
| install maven plugin.
| commons-httpclient now installed in war.
|-
| Plugin Manager
| had some odd behaviour in ec2 instances with limited inbound access - JSON response from update center was truncated
| For some reason fixing the port that slaves use to a single port resolved this issue
