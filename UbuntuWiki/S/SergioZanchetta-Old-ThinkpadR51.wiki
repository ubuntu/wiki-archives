==== Notes ====

I was able to get dual-head and Xinerama working under 7.10 Gutsy using the X11 config file additions from <nowiki>[[LaptopTestingTeam-ThinkpadR52-Multihead]]</nowiki> which are reproduced below:

For testing, I mainly used a setup such as:

<pre>
/usr/bin/X -layout "Multihead" ; less -S /var/log/Xorg.0.log
</pre>

or

<pre>
startx -- -layout "Xinerama" &
</pre>

'''Conclusion:''' The resolution issue might be fixable by sticking modelines in and using Options such as NoDDC.  Enough things are broken that for high-performance use, the result sucks badly.  There it will shine though is using presentations and being able to have notes/demos on one screen and slides on the external CRT.  If you really lucky, it maybe possible to flick around betwen slides and demos, allowing you to ''queue up'' the other one whilst you're waiting.  (It should only be a couple of bits to set the routeing of the display pipes...)

To get GDM to run, I did the rather hackish:

which then selects the 'layout' called 'Xinerama' when X is started.
