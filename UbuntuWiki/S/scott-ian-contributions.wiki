__TOC__

I have not contributed much, but I will once I get an opportunity to do so.  Any noticeable contribution will likely be posted at <nowiki>[[http://ian.perebruin.com/|my blog]]</nowiki>.  I have created a pause program equivalent the the Windows one.  It is nothing exciting, but I am trying to get it into the Debian Sid repository.
