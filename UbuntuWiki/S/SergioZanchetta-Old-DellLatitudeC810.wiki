==== Notes ====
The following modules also give errors in the kernel and should be blacklisted:

intel_rng
iwlwifi_rc80211_simple
ieee80211

I don't have any further information about these errors.  Wireless, including scanning and WPA, works just fine with a 3Com 3CRWE154G72 CardBus card and the prism54 kernel module.

For some reason, the IDE HDD and DVDROM show up as sda and sdb instead of hda and hdb.  Both seem to work fine, though.

The nvidia driver works properly on this laptop, but breaks suspend/resume/hibernate.  The graphics card is not capable of running Compiz.
