==== Notes ====

I did not install Feisty, as this was only a Live-CD Test if it would be worth the while to install it on this laptop. Will update if my friend wishes an Ubuntu installation. But it's good to see everything (that's needed) is working from the live CD and other stuff (Bluetooth, fingerprint scanner) is at least recognized in the hardware info.
