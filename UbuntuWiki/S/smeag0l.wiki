Hi out there i've been using Gnu/Linux since 2003, started with dualboot Windows 98 Redhat 6.0 but in 2005 i changed to debian woody single boot. I have Been using ubuntu since 2008 8.04 Hoary Hedgehog first tried ubuntu in 2005 5.04 but found it was to unstable compared to debian so turned back to debian quickly. I am currently running Lucid Lynx 10.04 Final.
