=== Current Issues ===
The standard GSPCA driver with hardy, does not support the webcam and generates alot of error messages (behind the gui).

All tests are done with the gspca module blacklisted.

<code>echo "blacklist gspca" | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist</code>

One case, where the wlan interface would not work after resume from hibernation. Could not reproduce.

=== System Info ===
system-manufacturer: Acer, inc.

system-product-name: TravelMate 4220

=== Hardware details ===

Following results are only tested with the opensource ati driver (not the binary fglrx driver, required for 3D acceleration). This may have an affect on hibernation as well as graphics related tests.
