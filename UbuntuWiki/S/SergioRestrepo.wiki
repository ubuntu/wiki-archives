I am a CS student from Medellin, Colombia. I am an active member of the <nowiki>[[ColombianTeam|Colombian LoCo Team]]</nowiki> and the #ubuntu-es and #ubuntu-co IRC channels. I have brought Ubuntu installs to most of the computer rooms in my <nowiki>[[http://www.upb.edu.co|university]]</nowiki> and managed to make the curriculum more flexible so we can turn in assignments written in languages like Python and Perl.
