=== Current Issues ===

 1. After resume from suspend2ram, video playback is "blocky", about an order of magnitude slower than it should be. Refer to https://launchpad.net/bugs/84898

 2. Occasionally, upon resume, the network "isn't there": Network Manager spins but never connects. Sometimes a suspend-resume cycle corrects this, sometimes not, and a reboot is required. No bug report (yet), because no reliable way to reproduce or track. I'm working on it....

 3. Occasionally, upon resume, sync with my Palm PDA over serial does not work. Sometimes a suspend-resume cycle corrects this, sometimes not, and a reboot is required. No bug report (yet), because no reliable way to reproduce or track. I'm working on it....

And not really an issue, but: "BIOS age (1999) fails cutoff (2000), acpi=force is required to enable ACPI". ACPI works fine, this machine should be whitelisted. I added this to a bug report, I'm sure I did, I may create one specific to this machine. Refer also to http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/How_to_make_ACPI_work#ThinkPads_on_which_it_is_recommended_to_use_ACPI
