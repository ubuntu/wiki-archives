=== 2006-04-08 No Network at Boot ===

My netowrk did not start properly at boot. After much exploring, I zerod in on the `/etc/network/interfaces` file as the source of the problem. This is what it was: <pre>

auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

mapping hotplug
        script grep
        map eth0

iface eth0 inet dhcp

auto dsl-provider
iface dsl-provider inet ppp
provider dsl-provider

auto eth0

    pre-up /sbin/ifconfig eth0 up # line maintained by pppoeconf
</pre>

After reading the `man interfaces`, the last line, the `per-up` line, looks out of place. pre-up` is an option for `iface`, not `auto`. So I moved the `auto eth0` up to just before the `mapping hotplug` and rebooted. Now it works.

Here is my new `/etc/network/interfaces` file: <pre>

auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

auto eth0
mapping hotplug
        script grep
        map eth0

iface eth0 inet dhcp

auto dsl-provider
iface dsl-provider inet ppp
  provider dsl-provider
  pre-up /sbin/ifconfig eth0 up # line maintained by pppoeconf
</pre>

Now all I have to do is to get `ppp0` to restart after sleeping. Sigh.
