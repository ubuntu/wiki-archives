=== Old Edgy Notes ===
* Bluetooth can work if patch from http://www.sfires.net/toshiba/ is applied.  I had to manually modify that patch to suit the laptop however, which proved to not be worthwhile.  This patch should be reworked and resubmitted to the kernel to see if it can be accepted for inclusion.
* It is possible to hibernate if you install the hibernate package from the universe repository, you need to add ipw2200 to your list of restricted modules and you have to use the "nv" x11 driver however.  When using this package, you can't actually use the hibernate button in the powerdown menu.  You have to do it from a terminal.
