=== Softmodem / Winmodem ===

A Softmodem is a software modem designed to use a host computer's resources (mostly CPU power and RAM but sometimes even any eventually present audio hardware) instead of dedicated hardware of its own, unlike traditional modems.

They are also referred to as a Winmodem because the first commercially available softmodems mostly targeted the Microsoft Windows operating system running on IBM-PC compatibles, although their usage has become more widespread over other operating systems and machines e.g. embedded systems and Linux.
