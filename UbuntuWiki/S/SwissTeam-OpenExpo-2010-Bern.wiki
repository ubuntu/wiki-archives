=== Date and time ===

The booth will be on Wednesday and Thursday, 24/25 March at the BEA expo in Bern.

=== Booth layout ===

1 table (smaller but hight than last time), 1 chairs/barstool

They changed the booth layout slightly. I think 1 notebook and 2-3 people per day will be enough -- <nowiki>[[ErwinHerrsche|Erwin]]</nowiki>
