Have tried Linux on and off since early Slackware days, 20 minutes per floppy over a 14k4 modem. Also tried Mandrake and Debian, but liked Ubuntu for the intelligent selection of default packages and the separation of security updates from feature upgrades. 

Currently running Ubuntu Dapper 6.06 Beta on a Dell Inspiron 6400 with mostly success. I have had two motherboard failures on a brand-new machine within 10 days. Is this a bad batch of motherboards in New Zealand, or does Dapper kill motherboards?
