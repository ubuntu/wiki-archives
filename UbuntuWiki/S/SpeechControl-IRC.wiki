<<BR>>'''Why multiple channels?'''<<BR>>
There is competition in this market and we do not want the big corporations to abuse and patent our ideas.
We believe accessibility should be free and open to all. 
All we request before accessing is that you have signed the <nowiki>[[community-conduct | Code of Conduct]]</nowiki> and that you are authed with freenode. Next to that, we want to avoid chatter to be mixed up with development talk. New visitors have no use of bazaar talk and developers would be confused by their questions.

Ok, to explain patenting and prior art, to protect the project from being patentent, we need to be able to show prior art.
For prior art to be valid, you need to be able to announce a working prototype.
Until that time, some other corp can do the same and patent it.
So for this reason, the project needs to be protected and therefore, we only invite the people we know that support open source. When we have a working prototype, we can announce it and open up the developers channel.

=== Pastebins ===

If you need to share output from your system with other people in the channel and it's more than 2 lines long, you should use a pastebin; <nowiki>[[http://pastebin.com/]]</nowiki> is a good one to use. Set your content to expire.

=== IRC Ops ===

IRC Ops are people in an IRC channel who have extra privileges and responsibilities. They are the people to call for any trouble in a channel. To get their attention, type '''!ops''' into the channel.

'''The ops are listed at the top of the page'''

If there are no ops around you can try <nowiki>[[http://freenode.net/faq.shtml#helpfromstaff|contacting a Freenode staffer]]</nowiki>.

== Settings ==
To make a channel a safe place, we recommend the following settings.
Use IPv6, use SSL, auth automatically.

=== IPv6 (optional) ===
To make use of IPv6 protocol it needs to be working. 
If your provider does not offer you an IPv6 address, you can make use of <nowiki>[[http://www.remlab.net/miredo/ | Teredo]]</nowiki> / SixXS / gogoNet6 or a similar tunneling service.
To use IPv6 on the 'Ubuntu Servers' go to the menu of Xchat. Select Network List. Click Edit to modify. A new window appears. Here you can edit the default server to irc.ipv6.freenode.net/6667 
IPv6 protocol is now done.

=== SSL ===
To make use of Secure Socket Layer.
Go to the menu of Xchat. Select Network List. Click Edit to modify. A new window appears.
Here you can check Use SSL for all the servers on this network.

=== Auth ===
To join #ubuntu-speechcontrol-devs you need to be authed with freenode nickserv.
Go to the menu of Xchat. Select Network List. Click Edit to modify. A new window appears.
Here you can edit Server Password. Type your freenode NickServ password here.
