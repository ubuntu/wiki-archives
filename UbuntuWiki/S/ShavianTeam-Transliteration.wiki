=== Ways forward ===
There are two possible ways forward:

==== Rosetta ====
We could add en@shaw to the list of languages into which Rosetta can translate.
This was previously rejected by the Rosetta admins:

However, a new question is now open:

==== PPA ====
If we can't use Rosetta, we could simply create all the data and build the packages ourselves in our own PPA.

=== Methods of automated transliteration and disambiguation ===
See http://shavian.org.uk/set/ for one possible method of automated transliteration.
