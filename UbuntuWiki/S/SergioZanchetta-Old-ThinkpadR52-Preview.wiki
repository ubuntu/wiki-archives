=== Current Issues ===

Major Issues:

* NONE.

Medium Issues:

* S-video TV-out very probably doesn't work (untested)
* ExpressCard state unknown (untested, probably works)

Trival Issues:

* Hardware Mute state not reflected in mixer
* No on-screen display of magic keys
* Back and Forwards do not make Firefox move (Actually, these keys are a Royal PITA because of their [mis-]placement).
* Fn-Space does not 'zoom' to stretched 640x480 (how to recognise this key sequence?)
* Suspend must be manually enabled in `/etc/defaults/acpi`
* Num Lock non-functional: `xmodmap -e 'keycode 77 = Num_Lock'`
* Accelerometer is not used to park hard-disk

==== Notes ====

===== Occasional/Erratic ===

DVD Won't eject as user;  gives:

<pre>
paul@katu:~$ eject /dev/cdrom
eject: unable to eject, last error: Inappropriate ioctl for device
paul@katu:~$ sudo eject /dev/cdrom
* ejected*
</pre>

===== Performance ====

<pre>
$ which glxgears | xargs strings | grep benchmark | xargs glxgears
4913 frames in 5.0 seconds = 982.508 FPS
</pre>

===== Hidden magic keys? =====

These are sequences when pressing `Fn+$key` does not produce a keycode, meaning that it's being magically eaten!  (But where to?).
