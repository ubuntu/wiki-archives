I am currently working as an IT Professional in Tata Consultancy Services and providing IT Vendorship to Cisco Systems, in San Jose, California.<<BR>>
I have been using linux since 2003, and Ubuntu since Warty Warthog 4.10 (i still have the glazed CD pack overhead ;-) ). I mostly use linux as a server, both for day-to-day use as well as development.<<BR>>
I am comfortable in a good deal of programming languages, including C, C++, Java/J2EE, SQL/Pl-SQL, Tibco, Business Objects, HTML, CSS, Javascript, XML, AJAX.

My contributions to Ubuntu so far have been concentrated in IRC, where I have been an active participant.
