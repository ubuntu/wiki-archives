==== Notes ====

(1) You have to use the failsafe video option to install at all, when you have installed correctly, you can change the video driver to nvidia - and you will get correct resolution.

(2) With compiz, the screensaver is all white when returning from suspend. After entering the password blindly, your back.

(3) You have to blacklist the ssb (and maybe the b43) module and use the Windows driver with ndiswrapper, to get the wireless work.

(4) It works, I can scan my fingerprint, but the software for integrating this equipment with Gnome is still experimental.
