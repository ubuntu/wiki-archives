Hi, I am a Linux Developer and love Ubuntu. I have been resigning things for a new OS that is similar to Ubuntu. I am also creating a UI that can work in Ubuntu. I am planning to release all of it by the end of the year. I am doing the Project myself so it is very difficult. I am also building a new computer from scratch with some parts I obtained and bought online. This machine will run Ubuntu. I am very happy to be a contributor to the Linux and Ubuntu community.
