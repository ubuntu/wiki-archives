__TOC__

SteekyTV is a hobby project I'm working on. It allows Ubuntu users to watch over 40 online TV stations on their Ubuntu desktop. This program consists of a basic form with a channel selector and an embeded mplayer.  The channels list is maintained server side. You need to have gambas and the necessary codecs to installed use it.
