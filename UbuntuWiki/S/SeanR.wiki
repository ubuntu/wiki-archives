__TOC__

SeanR is a PSU communication and political science student whose love of community efforts and contribution drew him to Ubuntu.

At present he is looking for ways to become more involved in the effort, though his schooling often keeps him too busy to do much.  He hopes to be able to contribute in some way by working with the Loco <nowiki>[[PDXTeam]]</nowiki>.

He's now a member of Ubuntu BugSquad, and is trying to learn enough about <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MOTU/Packages/Merging|merging]]</nowiki> to help <nowiki>[[MOTU]]</nowiki> during the Edgy merge.  He's also tired of talking in the third person, and will probably rewrite this page in the future, using the present tense, because this is annoying.  Then again, maybe not.

SeanR can be e-mailed at sean.rains@gmail.com or srains@pdx.edu.  His nicknames on Freenode are antinobody, and sean.
