=== Executive Summary ===

Ubuntu Dapper Drake works great. Edgy and Feisty, however, failed.

=== Current Issues ===

I did not manage to install Edgy or Feisty: The system boots up from the Live CD and starts X, but the Gnome Desktop reacts so extremely slowly that it is impossible to use it. (For example, when clicking on the Applications menu, it takes more than a minute for the menu to open up.) The hard disk is working nearly constantly all the time. 

=== System Info ===
<pre>
bios-version:V3.3 R01-A0X3 EN
system-manufacturer:Acer
system-product-name:TravelMate 220
