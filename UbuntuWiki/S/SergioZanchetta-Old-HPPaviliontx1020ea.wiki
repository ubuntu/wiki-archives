==== Notes ====
 1. restricted-manager correctly installs and configures the nvidia driver. 
{{{
carl@canning:~$ glxinfo | grep rendering
direct rendering: Yes}}}
{{{
carl@canning:~$ glxgears 
4851 frames in 5.0 seconds = 970.185 FPS
7936 frames in 5.0 seconds = 1587.031 FPS
8618 frames in 5.0 seconds = 1723.554 FPS
8624 frames in 5.0 seconds = 1724.671 FPS
8624 frames in 5.0 seconds = 1724.626 FPS}}}

 2. Requires addition of 
<code>options snd-hda-intel model=3stack</code>
to /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base. Causes built-in speaker and built-in microphones to function correctly. Jack sensing non-working, and other sound ports not tested.

EDIT: Compiling from Alsa HG with changes described in https://bugtrack.alsa-project.org/alsa-bug/view.php?id=3236 allows auto-muting with model=dallas, and the headphone jack works with the line "{0x15, AC_VERB_SET_EAPD_BTLENABLE, 0x02}" added to alc861vd_dallas_verbs.

 3. driver bcm43xx works correctly after usage of bcm43xx-fwcutter. Rate limited to 20kBps, however. Ndiswrapper - both installed and freshly-compiled - works at reasonable speed but there is high ping and large packet loss to both local and remote servers. EDIT: As of 27/6/07, wireless seems to be working full-speed with bcm43xx without changes on my part. 

IN HARDY: Works after following the following instructions: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=751054
Earlierly, another reporter claimed: "Currently wireless is completely broken on both. Prior to this, ndiswrapper was fine but b43 had terrible range since -11 kernel"

 4. IR port is not a real ir receiver - it translates ir signals into keypresses. This works.

 5. Manual keypad switch functions correctly, as does indicator light. Turning the touchpad back on, however, seems to generate an F1 key event.

 a. nvidia-settings is able to hotplug new monitor and extend onto it, but the xorg.conf generation ignores the touchscreen and is hence worthless for saving changes. Hotplugged monitors do not inform GNOME of 2 monitors, so maximise etc. are basically broken. Manual Twinview configuration allows hotplugging with xrandr - http://pastebin.com/937114 - but only if x is started with the external monitor plugged in. Touchscreen calibration is ludicrous when the desktop is stretched.

 b. Webcam works in ekiga with V4L2 selectged; xawtv and v4l-conf error out, and amsn shows an incredibly distorted picture. Cheese shows and records video and stills perfectly.

 c. Some buttons; Rotate Screen, Settings and VGA-Out; generate no signal in showkey, xev or dmesg. I have no idea how to proceed on this.
