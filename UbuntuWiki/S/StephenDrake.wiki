=== About ===

Only been using GNU/Linux since October 2004, so I'm still new to this. I tried Mandrake(not bad), Suse(too heavy on resources) and Mepis(quite good) before settling on Ubuntu(pretty, but powerful). But I'll still have a go at whatever turns up on the cover of ''Linux Format'', or ''Linux'' Magazines.

Mostly I have been trying to help improve our favourite distro by putting it on every laptop or desktop I can get access to and getting things to work.
