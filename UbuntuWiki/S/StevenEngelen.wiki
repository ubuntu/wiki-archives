=== About Me ===

I've been an Ubuntu enthusiast for some years now, and I think the time is right to give something back to this distribution and its community. As a starting point, I'd like to apply to the BugSquad, and see where it goes from there on. So, I would like to request a mentor.

Since this is fairly new to me, I don't really have a particular area of interest (yet :-) ).

I live in Belgium (Dutch speaking part), the time zone I live in is +0100 UTC (or CET).
