=== Summary ===
The blueprint is a quick outline of the initial steps in bringing the Java <nowiki>[[http://mary.dfki.de|MARY TTS]]</nowiki> engine to the Ubuntu operating system via a simple C++ API.

=== Release Note ===
This API for libopenmary is an object-orientated version of the REST API found on the <nowiki>[[http://mary.dfki.de:59125|MARY TTS web API]]</nowiki>. This is designed to provide the same API that MARY does and add an additional that MARY doesn't; '''output'''.

=== Rationale ===
Such a proficient TTS should be packaged with Ubuntu and included perhaps in the repositories of Debian due to its ability to articulate English, German and Dutch clearly.

=== User stories ===
''No stories applicable at the moment.''

=== Assumptions ===
This library assumes that MARY is up and running.

=== Design ===
We're aiming for a pretty OOP-style application and work is going to be done to import this to Speech Dispatcher.

=== Implementation ===
* Work To Be Done:
** Complete API rendering (in openmary.cpp)
** Perfect audio output
** Permit conversion to different audio types (ie: OGG, MP3, etc.)  
=== Effort ===
''All work visible on the Launchpad page.''

==== UI Changes ====
''No UI is implemented in this application.''

==== Migration ====
There's a bit of speculation about bringing D-Bus and audio playback into a forked version of MARY; this perhaps bringing a more native experience with MARY and thus eliminating the need to use this library.

=== Test/Demo Plan ===
There's a CLI included with this library, feeding text should trigger playback.

=== Unresolved issues ===
* Audio playback needs to be perfected.
* Perhaps implementing a daemon to handle this to be the D-Bus stand-in?

=== BoF agenda and discussion ===
