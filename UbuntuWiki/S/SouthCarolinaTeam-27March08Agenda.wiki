| Wiki requires a list of accomplish. See my personal launchpad page for an EXAMPLE. Please do not copy and paste this. The TEAM ITSELF should probably compile one. Use the forums maybe? Brainstorm during meeting? I think we have accomplished quite a bit thus far...

| Introduction to and discussion of the Free Linux PC Program and how we might be able to coordinate efforts throughout the state of SC between the Ubuntu SC team and the FLPC program. We have FLPC groups starting in four different counties throughout SC and would like to create a network of groups throughout the state. UbuntuSC could certainly help to make that a reality.
