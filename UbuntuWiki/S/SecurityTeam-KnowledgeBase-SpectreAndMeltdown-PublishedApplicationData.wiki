== Spectre and Meltdown Published Application Performance ==

This page collects public information posted by reliably identified sources that describes (to at least a minimal degree) how workload performance has been affected by the Meltdown and Spectre mitigations. We've attempted to identify what fixes were in place at the time of the run, as most reports unfortunately do not indicate those — though given the complexity of the situation, it's not surprising that's unclear.

For the tests which were run against AWS, note Amazon applied a first set of updates on Jan 4th, and a further set on Jan 12th, the second set generally noted as reducing the performance impact. Note also that for full protection the guest microcode and OS also needs to be updated, but not all tests implemented or compared using them.
