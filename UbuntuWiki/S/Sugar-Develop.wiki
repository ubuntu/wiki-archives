=== Packaging ===

For the distro release (intrepid) we plan to use the Debian packaging of Sugar. Contributions are welcomed by the <nowiki>[[http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Sugar_on_Debian#Debian-OLPC|Debian OLPC team]]</nowiki>. If there are packaging issues, we may update the packages in universe directly where necessary.

Updated packages for hardy, and supplemental packages for intrepid will be published using PPAs.

=== Bug fixing and development ===

All code changes are to be done upstream. See the Sugar Labs <nowiki>[[http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Development_Team|Development Team]]</nowiki>.

Launchpad bugs related to code changes will be logged upstream in <nowiki>[[http://dev.laptop.org/|OLPC Trac]]</nowiki> (XO hardware-related) or <nowiki>[[http://bugs.sugarlabs.org/|Sugar Labs Trac]]</nowiki> (Sugar).
