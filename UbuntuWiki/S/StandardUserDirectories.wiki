=== Summary ===

User directories should contain a set of standard folders that programs could anticipate as a convention, the way Documents becomes a special folder in Gnome once it is created. Possibly: Documents, Movies, Music, Pictures... Each could feature a special icon. The paths for these folders could be reassigned through a preferences utility for those who don't like the default structure.

=== Rationale ===

Applications will be able to expect standard directory structures in user directories. Ubuntu would take the lead in defining a couple obvious directories: Music, Movies, and Pictures. Having these directories predefined for users along with decorative folder icons would help users acclimate to the Linux user directory concept by signaling that the user directory is for personal media files. It would also be possible to develop nautilus plugins to present special views for the particular directories.

=== Use cases ===

A user looking at his home directory will see folders with decorative icons for Music, Movies and Pictures. Media applications like Rhythmbox and Totem will default to these directories.
