=== Current Issues with Hoary ===
* you have to use '''hw-detect/start_pcmcia=false''' at boot.
* shutdown will only work if you unplug the USB devices or run a '''/etc/init.d/hotplug stop''' before shutdown (you can add this at the beginning of /etc/acpi/powerbtn.sh for example).
* hibernation works, but the system eventually hangs after some minutes.
* you have to add alsa and alsasound in the list of services to stop/start when hibernating or the soundcard will not works after resume.

=== Current Issues with Breezy/Dapper ===
* you have to stop hotplug at first boot, and add '''snd-hda-intel''' into '''/etc/hotplug/blacklist''', or the system will hang when trying to load the soundcard modules.
* sound is broken after hibernation, a '/etc/init.d/alsa force-reload' fix this.
