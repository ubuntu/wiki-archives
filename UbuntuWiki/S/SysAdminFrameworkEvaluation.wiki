=== Ebox platform ===
<nowiki>[[http://ebox-platform.com/|EBox platform]]</nowiki>

* Overview :
** In which language(s) is the product written ?
     perl
** Which other components/products/packages are needed ?
     openldap, samba, cups, openvpn
** Which platform is targeted ?
     linux, especially debian derivatives.
** Which license is used ?
     GPL.

* Packaging :
** How does upstream distributes the product ?
     Installation CD (debian package source available in SVN)
** Does upstream provide packages ?
     Yes, for Debian stable.

* Frontend :
** What type of frontend is provided ? 
*** Web interface:
***** Is it possible to modify the look'n'feel of the interface ? How ?
          While not being explicitly themable, eBox emits sensible looking html, so theming it should be a matter of simply dropping in a new .css.
*** Graphical UI:
       No
*** Console UI:
       No
*** Command line script:
       No
** How is user management handled ?
*** What type of user authentication is supported ?
       LDAP
*** Does it support access control ?
       No.

* Backend :
** Is there a clear separation of the backend and the frontend ? How ?
     '''TBD'''
** Is it possible to have multiple frontend ?
     '''TBD'''
** How does the framework handle configuration modification made by another component ?
     '''TBD'''
** How is the configuration stored ?
     gconf
** How are the local configuration files generated ?
     Uses a template engine :mason.

* Other features:
** Does the framework support multiple server management ?
*** Which protocol is used to communicate between servers ?
     A SOAP based method for managing multiple servers is in the works, but not anywhere near completion at this point.
** Does the framework support rollback of previous configuration ?
     No
** Is it possible to view changes between two configurations ?
     No
** Is it possible to view which modification are going to be applied before committing them ?
     No
** Is there an auditing system (logs which actions have been done by who) ?
     No
** How to add a new service to the framework ?
     '''TBD'''
