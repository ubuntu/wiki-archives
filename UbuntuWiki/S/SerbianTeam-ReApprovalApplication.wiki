=== Roadmap ===
==== Stronger cooperation with other free software teams in our country ====
Although we are already collaborating with local free software communities, such as:
* <nowiki>[[http://ns-linux.org/|LUGoNS]]</nowiki> (Linux user group Novi Sad) <nowiki>[[http://www.flickr.com/photos/ubuntu-srbija/sets/72157618033816322/|images]]</nowiki>, 
* <nowiki>[[http://www.mozilla-srbija.org|Mozilla Serbia]]</nowiki> (community of Mozilla developers), 
* <nowiki>[[http://rs.wikimedia.org|Wikimedia Foundation Serbia]]</nowiki>, 
we plan to expand further that collaboration and spread the free software love. 

==== New hosting server ====

Due to limitation of our current server, which is unable to cope with growth of our community, Ubuntu LoCo Serbia has taken steps towards switching to a new hosting server. Transition will take place in course of the next few days, and new design has been created for Main page, Forum and Wiki according to new Ubuntu branding.
Samples are <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuloco.gridsrv.net/|here]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuloco.gridsrv.net/testforum/|here]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuloco.gridsrv.net/wiki/|here]]</nowiki>

==== Expanding the core administration team ====
Our community has grown exponentially in the past five years, and we are constantly looking for new forum, site, and wiki admins to compensate for the growth. 

==== Blog Community ====
In cooperation with local blog community, we have started <nowiki>[[http://planeta.ubuntusrbija.org/|Planet Ubuntu Serbia]]</nowiki> web portal, that releases blogs on Ubuntu and FLOSS related topics. 

==== Release parties ====
Ubuntu and Free Software are fun, so we plan to make release parties in future as tradition and make them around the Serbia. The 10.10 release party is the part of that plan.  

==== Promo material ====
T-shirts, caps, teacups, pens... With Ubuntu and Ubuntu-RS motives of course  

==== Education support ====
* Several team members expressed interest in supporting schools in two Belgrade Municipalities (Vracar and Rakovica) where elementary schools students use Edubuntu based programs. We plan to set up the infrastructure to help them coordinate and improve skills, both of teachers and students. We have the opportunity to participate in program as a official software support.  

'''Facts:'''
* Rakovica municipality – 1104 computers in 14 schools
* Vracar municipality – 1417 computers in 11 schools
* Edubuntu 9.04. - 100% localized
We plan to upgrade computers to Edubuntu 10.04 LTS in October; for that purpose, LoCo members are translating additional applications.
