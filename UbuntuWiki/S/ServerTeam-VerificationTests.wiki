__TOC__

This page is intended to leave breadcrumbs of for whoever looks to verify a package, but the tests used in the past neither made it into
* upstream build time tests executed on build time
* <nowiki>[[http://packaging.ubuntu.com/html/auto-pkg-test.html|dep8 tests]]</nowiki> of the package
* <nowiki>[[https://jenkins.ubuntu.com/server/|server regression tests]]</nowiki>

This is just a collection of links to scripts, repos or howtos, but depending on adoption might grow over time:
* <nowiki>[[https://code.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-server/+git/strongswan-test|strongswan]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[https://code.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-server/ubuntu/+source/qemu-migration-test/+git/qemu-migration-test|qemu-migration-test]]</nowiki> (on the way into server regression tests)
* <nowiki>[[https://code.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-server/ubuntu/+source/dpdk-testing/+git/dpdk-testing|dpdk]]</nowiki> (slowly on the way into server regression tests)

Always a good source to look for qa and package verification is the great work by the security Team at <nowiki>[[https://code.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-security/qa-regression-testing/+git/qa-regression-testing|qa-regression-testing]]</nowiki>. Quite often we end up just adding wrappers to their great work to be able to use it with less setup/prep time.
