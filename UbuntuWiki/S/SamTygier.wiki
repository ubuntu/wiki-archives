I have added a few bits and pieces to the wiki

* <nowiki>[[DropShadows]]</nowiki>
* Realplayer stuff on <nowiki>[[RestrictedFormats]]</nowiki>
* Mac-on-Linux networking to <nowiki>[[MacOnLinuxHowto]]</nowiki>
* Installing fonts <nowiki>[[FontInstallHowto]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[UbuntuScientists]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[HowToZeroconf]]</nowiki> zeroconf is a very cool network technology. if you have used Mac OS X then you will know it as Bonjour (formerly Rendezvous), its how iTunes finds music on your network, and how iChat find other iChaters. Anyways, the ground work exists on Linux, and you can already use it for things like ssh.
* <nowiki>[[NetgearWG511AndViaEpiaMIIHowto]]</nowiki> there is a bug with the Via Epia MII bios that makes WG511 not work. this fixes it
* <nowiki>[[PowerPCFAQ]]</nowiki>
