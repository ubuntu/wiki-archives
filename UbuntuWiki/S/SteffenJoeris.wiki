Hi mates

This is just a short wiki page and it lacks some nice pictures and stuff, I am just not good at it :(

My intentions regarding ubuntu are to help people who package stuff for ubuntu universe to get their changes back into debian main. If you read this and have some problems with getting your stuff back into debian or you are just looking for a sponsor or someone who can explain you some debian internals and help you in general with debian related things do not hesitate to write me or nudge me on IRC, I will try to help you as good as I can.

IRC nick: white (on oftc and freenode)

email: white@debian.org
