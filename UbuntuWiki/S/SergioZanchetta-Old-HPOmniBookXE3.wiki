==== Notes ====
Front panel skip/play_pause/stop_eject/skip/volume up/volume down buttons don't work in Ubuntu but in power off -state work normally. The small LCD shows battery status as supposed all the time, also when the computer's on (shows same percent as Ubuntu battery monitor). 

All hotkeys reported above not working give no signal with showkey, acpid or xev.

The  < |>  -key is dead, but that's a HP EEPROM hardware problem.

So basically everything one needs work out of the box, including 3D (thank's Intel), except the volume/mute keys & contrast.

Feisty Ubuntu installation jammed in partition, Kubuntu was OK.
