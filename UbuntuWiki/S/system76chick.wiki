{*} Emma Marshall was an asset in producing ``Ubu``Con at Ohio Linux Fest 2013.  Her spirit and determination helped drive us forward. In the exhibition hall her cooperation with Ubuntu Ohio as well as with Project Community Computing helped us all achieve our outreach goals.  Emma is dedicated to the Ubuntu community and ready for consideration to be an "Ubuntu Member".  <nowiki>[[skellat]]</nowiki> -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:skellat]]</nowiki>  
Emma has been working in Ubuntu for a long time. I met her in 2012, and since then, her work has been increasing each time. She's now the Team Contact for Ubuntu-US-CO, and I believe her contributions are valuable enough for her to be a member. Definite +1, keep up the good work! - -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:jose]]</nowiki> 
Emma is a great person for this role, she has helped so many with her contributions to Ubuntu and to the spreading of the good works of Ubuntu. She is an all around great person. She has given time to get me help when I needed it as well.- -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:rstreeter78]]</nowiki>
