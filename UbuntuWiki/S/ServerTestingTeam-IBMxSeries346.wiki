=== Current Issues ===
Dapper Drake 6.06.1 LTS Release - i386 kernel works 98% of the time.  i686 SMB kernel fails every time.  System hard locks and then reboots itself.  All hardware is current on firmware etc...  i386 kernel has done this 2-3 times over several weeks.  i686 SMP kernel does this every boot within 1 minute of logging into the desktop.  More info to follow.  First test to resolve this was to see if Feisty would install and run an SMP kernel.  It does.  So far, no reboots.
