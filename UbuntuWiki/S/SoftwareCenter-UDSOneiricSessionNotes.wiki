__TOC__

=== Things discussed in the session ===

* Improve performance
** There are significant performance improvements in Natty, esp lisvtiew speedup and startup time improvements. What other issues are still problematic?
** Issues for Maverick-era are outlined here (many have been addressed in Natty): https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/software-center/+bug/542336/comments/5
** Improve the experience when installing .deb files directly
** Needs a speedup
** Display the details page immediately, or at least a "loading" spinner (we currently show the main screen for a few moments before displaying the details view)

* bigger icons in the listview (64x64)
** app-install-data doesn't have scalable icons for every app
** would be nice as a policy to have the icons in software center match what comes out in
** For comparison, Chrome Web Store request 128x128 minimum, App Store 512x512

* Touch-friendly UI:
** Some parts you can't select unless you have a mouse http://www.twitpic.com/4wxqs4/full
** http://code.google.com/chrome/webstore/ocs/imagegarnerings.html/

* Show less Text and information unless it's needed
** Focus on visuals for selecting apps, once click you get more info
** Add Kinetic animations for revealing these info. http://goo.gl/IONWq

* more categories in USC by default not just in advanced view (not just rating)

* Unity after you install (usually true, but background colors may vary)
** new icon set
** we really need a new icon for Software Center itself

* Simplify the UI (this may be a big topic and so we might move this to its own blueprint)
** Remove the left navigation pane, it takes a lot of space but where to put the informatin
** the expander is tiny and often unnoticed
** should expand by default, especially Get Software

* Enhance the current unity launcher integration
** Implement the remaining parts of the full spec at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SoftwareCenter#Learning%20how%20to%20launch%20an%20application
** "Fly" the icon to the launcher, or for a simpler alternative, make icon appear in the launcher immediately upon clicking "install"
** Display installation progress in launcher icon itself
** Make "add to launcher" available whenever a details view is displayed, instead of only after a new install
** This would require the ability to query the launcher about whether an item is already contained there
** Support add-to-launcher for multiple items installed via the list view
** Offer to install the launcher more visibly -- lower right is bad in maximized full desktop use case. Perhaps slide in from top
** Provide the ability to simply drag and drop apps from the app lens to the launcher in order to INSTALL and pin them to the launcher

* Provide checkboxes to select multiple apps in the list and then install/remove them at once (like synaptic)

* Default window size hides the featured/new items
** Detect screen size, give different default window size when doing this

* Translation issues:
** Would be good for Software Center to know about how translated an application is (according to launchpad) and display it to the user
** Untranslated package descriptions could be detected, offered to translate
** Reviews are isolated by locales, so to some extent reviews can help tell users about serious translation issues in the app itself.

* Possible move to webkit/html for app pages

* Search improvements
** support facets in search, i.e. better search suggestions (some very early work here lp:~mvo/software-center/debtags-tag-suggestions-support)

* Add support for categories in for-purchase app view instead of the current flat list
   - Will need this as we get more and more for-purchase apps

* "Dynamic" list of Featured apps
   - Get the list of feature apps from the server (ISD), this will allow it to be updated more easily and more often
   - Example of a list of featured apps generated based on what's installed locally and data from R&R: http://paste.garneringubuntu.com/606818/

* Support maturity ratings (for age-appropriateness) (had separate session on this)
** (we should use debtags for this IMO) there is also some work done in debian about this, worth checking with them
** if a title carries an ESRB rating it would be good to be able to display this in a nicely integrated fashion

* Other listview tweaks:
** pricing in the listview if purchasable?
** a subtle request to review an app if installed but not already reviewed by the user

* Screenshots in the details view
** Support multiple screenshots per application
** Add support for displaying a video in the details view (YouTube integration?)

* Support for Synaptic features still not in Software Center
** That would also decrease the number of programs we ship that (a) use gksudo and (b) don't use Ubuntu's menu bar

* Webdirectory work with ISD and integration of "override" features, e.g. to allow improving the description, keywords, category, tags etc.

* Improvements to the details view
** standard formatting of descriptions, indent and bullet points and perhaps links etc
** Minimal/recommended system requirements (particularly important for purchasable software, opengl games or anything that relies on specific hardware). Would help avoid people purchasing a game for which their system is not capable of running acceptably.
** Be able to recommend drivers, cpu speed, memory, any required peripherals, persistent internet connection

* Improve offline behavior, currently we prohibit any install remove actions when no network connection is available. best approach would be to add actions to a queue from which we can offer to action upon an internet connection being established.

* WebLive integration in Software Center (better UI)

* Far future fantasies:
** Valve Steam-like (videos, social integration, forums/community built in)
