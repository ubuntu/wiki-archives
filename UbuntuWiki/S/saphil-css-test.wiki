__TOC__

This page is for testing css related to the problem noted on  https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-doc/2012-June/016737.html
The problem was that the default theme 'light' wouldn't show italics.  This probably means that styles.css has an error that doesn't let it show the italics.  I am reading through the css and testing what the various themes do to a page with various font styles on it.

__'''Solved'''__: This bug was apparently fixed quite a while ago (Jan 2011), <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-website/+bug/701026]]</nowiki> 
It is interesting that people were still having issues with this in September of 2012, however the people talking about this issue might have just found a way to work around the issue, e.g. ''Never using italics,'' which would reduce their chance of discovering the issue had been cleared.

Emphasis
    ''italics''; 

    '''bold'''; 

    '''''bold italics'''''; 

    ''mixed '''bold''' and italics'';
