=== About Saw Khaing ===

Hello! I am Saw Khaing. I live in Mandalay. I was being a Mandalay Technological University student of Electronic and Communication major.Now, I can hold AGTI and Bachelor of Technology. After that, I tried to observe the knowledge of computer Fields. I'm willing to do something in IT to achieve my life. I'm undoubtly interested in networking and system administration. I was lucky that I met the Ubuntu Myanmar LoCo Team at Barcamp Mandalay 2011. According to <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/kokoye2007|Ko Ko Ye]]</nowiki>, the team leader introduce Ubuntu into my life. I'm keen to understand the meaning of Ubuntu ,Ubuntu working system and the Ubuntu Organization. <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/kokoye2007|Ko Ko Ye]]</nowiki> and other team member always answer my doubting thoughts on Ubuntu and I'm so pleased to use Ubuntu. I, <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/htutmyat|Htut Myat]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/cohein|Hein Htet Aung]]</nowiki> are cooperating to surf the Ubuntu operating system. We also want to cooperate with Ubuntu Myanmar LoCo Team to share Ubuntu to the users such as novices, end-users, developers, system administrators and so on. We also want to share the benefits and advantages of Ubuntu to the whole IT professions of Mandalay. So, I, <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/htutmyat|Htut Myat]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/cohein|Hein Htet Aung]]</nowiki> tried our best to participate in Ubuntu sharing activities. We do these activities in camps, training center and computer universities of Mandalay. According to the guidelines of Ubuntu Myanmar LoCo Team, we did our best. Now, I can't pull myself from interesting Ubuntu. Whenever I have time, I spend my hours using and configuring Ubuntu. I also have the future plan as I want to take Linux exams to be a Linux Professional.Thank You!
