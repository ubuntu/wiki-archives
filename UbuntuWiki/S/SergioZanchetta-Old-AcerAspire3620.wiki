==== Notes ====

Great laptop, especially for its price. I'm using it without any problem with Beryl. The only serious drawback is the keyboard bug I described, which is very annoying and seriously hinders the work on the laptop if you don't use an external keyboard.
Also the battery life can be better. However I haven't installed MS Windows to see if the battery will last more with it.

Comment by Lausianne, 2007-12-10:
I installed and tested Xubuntu 7.10 on a 3620 for 1.5 days. The installation was a rather frustrating experience, starting with a keyboard layout issue (accents), ending with various bugs encountered when trying to connect an external monitor (beamer) which resulted amongst other problems in losing the keyboard settings (yes, strange). Crashes on various occasions (e.g. installing cpudyn, trying hibernation).
As long as it worked, it was very fast, though. XP performance issues were my reason to install Xubuntu.

Lausianne, 2008-05-03:
After the 7.10 failure I was hoping that version 8 would work better and it does indeed. None of the formerly encountered troubles: With 7.10 I wasn't able to install a swap partition, with 8.04 it just happened automatically. Very fast and smooth install, keyboard works, including special characters (öäüçô...). A few less serious issues as mentioned above (Current Issues). No total crashes after a day of intensive use.
Very fast compared to XP.
