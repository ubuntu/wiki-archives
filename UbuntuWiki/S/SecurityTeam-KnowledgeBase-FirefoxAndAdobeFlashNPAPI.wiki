=== Firefox blocks Adobe Flash NPAPI plugin for 11.2.202.481 and earlier ===
Several serious <nowiki>[[https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/flash-player/apsb15-18.html|security vulnerabilities]]</nowiki> were found in Adobe's flash plugin with exploits known to be in the wild. Because of the critical nature of the vulnerabilities, the Mozilla foundation decided to <nowiki>[[https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/add-ons-cause-issues-are-on-blocklist?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=Add-ons+Blocklist|block]]</nowiki> this version of the <nowiki>[[https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1182751|plugin]]</nowiki>. Unfortunately, at the time of the blocklist, only the PPAPI version of the plugin (as used by chromium) was available and Firefox users found the NPAPI plugin was blocked via Firefox's click-through security mechanism.

'''UPDATE:''' As of 2015/07/16, Adobe released 11.2.202.491 which fixes all known issues for PPAPI and NPAPI and updates are available for Ubuntu
