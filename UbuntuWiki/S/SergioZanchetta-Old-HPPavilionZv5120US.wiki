=== Current Issues ===
Modem not working out of the box
Wifi (bcm43xx) not working out of the box (you will need the firmware. I used the one from the Windows installation)
No 3d (some 3d with open source drivers, don't buy ati video cards)
Very low fps (Average ~500fps in glxgears)
Short battery life (1 hour, not really an OS issue though)

==== Notes ====

(*) acpi-V reports "battery won't charge", but it's charing. Reported bug.

(**) with ndiswrapper, with drivers in the installation cd from hp

(***) with bcm43xx, with "driver" from the installation cd from hp

(****) Works with sl-modem-daemon from repos, though a little buggy. For some reason, the daemon is in multiverse so you will need to enable the muliverse repository.
