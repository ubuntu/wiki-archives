* '''ntpdate''' - why always update the clock (especally not when there is no internet connection)
* '''pcmcia''' - not all laptop owners uses this port
* '''ppp''' - what the heck
* '''powernowd''' - do not start this service on machines not supporting it (celeron mobile ect.)

it will be great if enabling/disabling these services could be integrated into a wizard showed on the first boot. 
this wizard could also ask the user about installing universe/multiverse, mp3 support, gstreamer-plugins ect.

* '''rsync''' - whatfor?
* '''fetchmail''' - I don't think many enduser use this!
