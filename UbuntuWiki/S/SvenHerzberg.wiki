== SvenHerzberg ==

Sven Herzberg is 22 years old and studies computer science at the university of Hamburg. He's using GNU/Linux since 1998.

I created several small packages for personal use and for some friends since two years now and I have set up a small repository for these packages. As I get my spare time better and better organized I know that I will have time to maintain my packages with the time they deserve (not just 2 hours each weekend).

I'm the developer of a small GNOME-based <nowiki>[[http://www.nongnu.org/criawips|presentation application (criawips)]]</nowiki> and I'm very interested in the <nowiki>[[http://hula-project.org/|Hula mail and Calendar server]]</nowiki>.

Currently involved in Ubuntu by:

** using it
** telling people to use it and why they want to use it - at least as long as they haven't found ''their'' distribution (especially on German GNU/Linux events when representing <nowiki>[[http://www.gnome.org/|GNOME]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[http://www.gnome-de.org/|GNOME Germany]]</nowiki>)
** reporting bugs
** fixing some bugs (especially GNOME-related ones - usually trying to fix them Upstream)
** building a few packages for private and public use
** Documenting my experiences with LaptopTestingTeam/ThinkpadX41Tablet
** trying to keep the Wacom Tablet working for Dapper
