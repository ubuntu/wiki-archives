I started using computers in 1982 programming BASIC on an Apple ][ in junior high, even spending my lunch hour typing away to make some silly ASCII art rocket ship fly off the screen.  Note that this is not the ][+ or the ][c and this was ''way'' before Macs.  From there I moved onto a Commodore64 where my real inner geek developed.

While I have used Windows as I muddled throughout my life and my professional career I began using Linux with Ubuntu Feisty Fawn 7.04 in January of 2008 (thanks PC Magazine!) and reawakened my inner geek.  Suddenly life has meaning again.

Ubuntu Feisty was my first experience with Linux and I eagerly read and learned from wiki.ubuntu.com, Ubuntu Forums, mailing lists and blog posts.  You can see a specific subset of my accomplishments during this period below in <nowiki>[[ScottLavender#Goals Accomplished|Goals Accomplished]]</nowiki>.

During Hardy I became aware of Ubuntu Studio.  This was a great interest to me as a musician and I spent the next year learning about Ubuntu Studio, the associated applications, and how to make and record music on my computer.  Some of the results may be heard at <nowiki>[[http://wirblewind.rpmchallenge.com/|my RPM Challenge page.]]</nowiki>

Discovering Ubuntu Studio was a momentous and life changing event for me.  After I developed modicum of competency recording my own music I began to advocate to others about Ubuntu and Ubuntu Studio, which I still perform currently.

But I felt that I needed to give back in a more direct and active manner to this phenomenon that had so richly impacted my life.  Therefore, during Juanty I introduced myself to the Ubuntu Studio developer team and volunteered myself to help how ever I could.

I have been modestly involved with the Ubuntu Studio developer activities since that time.

However, contributions to Ubuntu Studio have been more expansive, including answering ubuntustudio-users email, filing bug reports, creating and/or filing Main Inclusion Reports (notably for JACK), packaging for back ports, helped keep audio applications current, updating Ubuntu Studio documentation, and helped organize Ubuntu Studio developer activies.

=== Testimonials ===

I've been working with ScottL on Ubuntu Studio related tasks through the Karmic and Lucid cycles.  Throughout this time he has demonstrated high levels of commitment and concern, and often ends up being *the* contact point to get things done.  His work includes advocacy, support, coordination, administration, development, release management, marketing, testing, bug triage, and many more areas too diverse to count.  I wholeheartedly and unreservedly endorse his application for Ubuntu Membership.  @-- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:persia]]</nowiki> @

Unfortantely I can't say very much about Scott's technical skills because our respective fields of interest are different. Nonetheless, he really surprised me for his presence, humility, never denying to do what is necessary for the Ubuntu Studio project. He has great organizational ability and I'm sure that, in the near future, he will also show a good job as leader. He also demonstrates good diligence in the learning process. So I strongly encourage the Board to approve his application.  @-- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:abogani]]</nowiki> @

In the time that I have worked with Scott, I have seen some great work done, mostly for the UbuntuStudio project. Scott has been willing to learn, is willing to lead, and has been very keen to see free software, particularly the UbuntuStudio project succeed. I am sure that Scott will continue to do great things for the Ubuntu community and the UbuntuStudio project. I am more than happy to recommend Scott for Ubuntu membership. @-- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:themuso]]</nowiki> @
