=== Introduction ===

Hi my name is Scott Morris.  I am an avid computer user and currently Tripple Boot Ubuntu 6.10, Windows XP MCE and Xubuntu 6.06.1.  I mainly use Windows :O but I use at least once a week Ubuntu 6.10.  The reason I have two versions of Ubuntu is because MonoDevelop on 6.10 (MD version 0.12) is broken but MD 0.10 on 6.06.1 is not.<<BR>><<BR>>I have a decent amount of computer knowledge and am very skilled with the inner workings of Computers.  I have worked with Windows (since 3.1 :) ), Mac OS since (I'm not sure) and different distributions of Linux from SUSE 9.3+ to DSL then finally to Ubuntu.

As not being creative with titles this will be this category for now.  I first got interested in Linux because Nero AG released NeroLINUX.  I have used Nero since I started using it since version 5.5 and I was cureous about what it was and how it worked.  So I went looking for what Linux was.  I found an old Red Hat CD but decided it was to old and asked a friend what he knew about Linux and he had only heard of SUSE.  I hunted it down on the Internet and downloaded it and installed it on a PII w/ MMX @ 300 MHz.  It was slow but interesting.  I started knowing nothing and slowly (well with in a few days) got to knowing how to perform some simple operations.  From there I installed it on my notebook and used it for a little while before removing it.  Then one day a friend and I were following a tutorial about [I won't say] and they wanted us to use the dd command and they recommended using the Ubuntu 5.04 Live CD.  I found it to be a bit different than my SUSE experience because of the Debian base that Ubuntu uses.  But I struggled with it a bit and picked it up quickly adding to my (at that time) little knowledge of anything Linux.  Later that same year, as I was starting to become very interested in this world of Linux, I stumbled back upon the Ubuntu website and read it and said "what can I loose" and ordered some of the free CDs (they had just released Breezy).  When I got them I installed it and, since having used it in the past, it felt welcoming.  Since then I have been using Linux a lot and have been gaining knowledge like crazy.  Just before I had gotten my Ubuntu CDs I had told a friend of mine, Collin Doering, about Linux and now he is crazy good with it and uses it as his primary OS.  All and all Linux has a very promising outlook and even give Microsoft a run for their money.  Happy Ubuntuing.

=== Interests ===

Most of my interests are computer related (in fact I think they all are, we will see).  Here is just some.

* Linux
* Programing C#
* Learning as much as possible about computers
* Learning various OSs
* Helping people with computers
* The Sims 2
* I will think of more in the future
