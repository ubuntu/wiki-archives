=== Notes ===

==== Hardware of nx7010 ====

All the hardware in this laptop seems to works really well under ubuntu.
The only little problems found in releases like 5.10 were the SD reader, 3D acceleration and other minor things.
SD reader became available in 6.06 and, despite a bit slow, works fine.
3D acceleration needed closed source drivers (fglrx) but since 6.06 has the new X.org driver with code from gatos project that makes pretty good 3D performance available.
Right now (6.06 & 6.10) the laptop works really well in default installations.

==== Intallation since Breezy Badger 5.10 ====

* Install goes smooth & without trouble at all
* Graphic card detected and properly configured. Screen detected and configured fine even with 1650x1080 resolution. 
* Sound OK. Sound keys work properly. Even The mute LED works properly out of the box.
* ACPI OK. CPU Frequency scaling works out of the box. Also Battery measurement.
* DVDRW OK. Tested with DVD & CD.
