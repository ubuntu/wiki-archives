== Integration Design ==

The main function for starfish is infrastructural, but we need to have end-to-end plans for how to get users involved and allowing them to discover encryption in context. This means that we may have to make patches for evolution and other communication programs such as telepathy in order to make starfish much more useful.

=== Evolution ===

* Use Case *

# Bob wants to send an email to Jane with a signature to guarantee to Jane the authenticity of the email.
# Jim wants to encrypt an email to Bob in order to make sure only bob can read it.

=== Telepathy ===

1. Jane wants to talk to Sara, but over a secure communications channel.

=== Key Locking ===

With integration it'll be a problem if the key is unlocked and then the computer is used by some other person.
