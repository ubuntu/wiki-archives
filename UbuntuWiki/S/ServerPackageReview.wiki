* '''Packages affected''': 

== Overview ==

Comparing ourselves to our coopetitors is a necessary task to know where we are at and decide where we could get better.

== Comparison ==
 
=== Package proposal for MIR ===

We should categorize the missing ones in three categories.
* agreed: means that we both agreed that we should pull them in supported list and will work on a MIR for Hardy
* Rejected: agreed during UDS that it should not be pulled in main

==== Agreed ====

The following is a table of packages for which we now need to write a MainInclusionReport (MIR) following the MainInclusionProcess.

Status should be one of :
* Assigned
* In Progress
* Completed
* Accepted

==== Comments ====
JeffSchroeder : syslog-ng is crippleware. Many of the features such as wire encryption and compression are only available in the commercial version. rsyslog is 100% compatible with the current sysklogd configuration file AND supports the commercial features of syslog-ng. Fedora chose rsyslog after an exhaustive review of the various choices. It has been the default syslog package since Fedora 8. See this page for an explanation of why it is better: http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/FeatureRsyslog

JoshuaTimberman : Please replace syslogkd with rsyslog and don't consider syslog-ng. Debian upstream will replace syslogkd with rsyslog starting with Lenny: http://wiki.debian.org/Rsyslog, also http://blog.gerhards.net/2008/07/rsyslog-will-become-debians-default.html.
