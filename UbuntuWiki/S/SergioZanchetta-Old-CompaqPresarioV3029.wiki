==== Notes ====
* Sound gave a little trouble. Apparently there a bug in ALSA (pre 1.0.13 versions) which cause trouble with the headphone jack. The 1.0.13 version fixes this problem though. Compile and install it. Create a "sound" file in the /etc/modprobe.d folder. Open this file and add :`options snd-hda-intel index=0 disable_msi=1`, but after that the Laptop keys increase/decrease volume works only for headphone. 

* * works right out of the box in Ubuntu 7.04. No need for the above mentioned tweak...
