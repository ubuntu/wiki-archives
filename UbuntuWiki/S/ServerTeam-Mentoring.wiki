__TOC__

Are you interested in joining the ServerTeam and contribute to Ubuntu ? Don't know where to get started ? The mentors of the ServerTeam are here to help you make your first contribution to Ubuntu.

This program is lightweight and short in time. You'll get a mentor from the ServerTeam and together:
  1. discuss your areas of interest.
  2. define a simple task to accomplish.
  3. get your contribution integrated in Ubuntu !

Interested ? Send an email to  introducing yourself and we'll take it from there.

==== Mentor guidelines ====

The mentor provides guidance during the whole process by:
** presenting existing procedures.
** pointing to existing communication channels (#ubuntu-server, ubuntu-server mailing list, other IRC channels and mailing lists).
** linking to key members of the ServerTeam and Ubuntu in general.                                          
** sponsoring one upload if the contribution is packaging related.
** giving feedback to the applicant in a timely manner.

Once the task has been accepted in Ubuntu, the contributor should have been in contact with the rest of the ServerTeam and should know where to ask questions.
