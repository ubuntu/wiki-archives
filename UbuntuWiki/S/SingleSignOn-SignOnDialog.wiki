''This specification is '''out of date''' and needs to be reconciled with <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/ubuntu-sso-client|the current implementation]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[https://docs.google.com/a/canonical.com/Doc?docid=0AU5sFuLRpCpBZGZra2pqY2pfODY2Z3RnbTl2Z3E&hl=en|the private specification]]</nowiki>.''

''Erratum: “Remember password” should be “Sign on automatically next time”''

The “Password:” field should be insensitive whenever “I have an Ubuntu Single Sign-On account” is not selected. The “Continue” button should be insensitive whenever the “E-mail address:” field does not contain a valid e-mail address, or when “I have an Ubuntu Single Sign-On account” is selected and the “Password:” field is empty. In addition, whenever there is not Internet connection, the “Continue” button should be insensitive and the bottom leading corner of the alert should feature a mini error icon and the text “Not connected to the Internet.”. (The appearance or disappearance of the error message should not resize the alert; it should always have been large enough to show the whole message.)

'''Test case:''' In a session where you have not signed in, choose “Write a review”; the sign-in dialog should appear. Disconnect from the Internet; the “Not connected to the Internet” error message should appear, and “Continue” should become insensitive. Reconnect to the Internet; the error message should disappear, and “Continue” should become sensitive.

When you activate “Continue”, the “Continue” button should become insensitive, and:

* If you chose “I want to register for an account now” or “I’ve forgotten my password”, USC should launch your preferred Web browser to the appropriate Web page, while a spinner and the text “Opening browser…” appears in the bottom leading corner of the alert for five seconds (providing feedback at least until the browser appears). Once the five seconds are up, the spinner and text should disappear, and the alert should reselect “I have an Ubuntu Single Sign-On account”, ready for you to enter your details once you have closed the browser window.

* If you chose “I have an Ubuntu Single Sign-On account”, a spinner and the text “Signing in…” should appear at the bottom leading corner, and the “Cancel” button should become “Stop”. (The change in label should not change the size of the button; it should always have been large enough for either label.)

 If the sign-in process stops unsuccessfully, either because you activated “Stop” or because of an error, the spinner and progress text should disappear, “Stop” should change back to “Cancel”, and “Continue” should become sensitive (unless there is no Internet connection). Then:

** If you activated “Stop”, “Cancel” should also become insensitive for one second (in case you double-clicked on “Stop” by mistake).

** If the e-mail address or password was incorrect, the error sound (if any) should play, the primary text of the alert should change to “Your Ubuntu Single Sign-On details were incorrect. Try entering them again.”, the “Stop” button should change back to “Cancel”, the “Continue” button should become sensitive, and the “E-mail address:” field should be focused.
 
** If there was any HTTP error while signing in, the error sound (if any) should play, and a mini error icon and the text “Couldn’t connect to the sign-on service.” should appear in the bottom leading corner of the alert.

Once you are signed in, the alert should close.
