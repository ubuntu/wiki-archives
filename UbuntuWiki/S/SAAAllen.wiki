Hey! A Wiki page! I could get the hang of this...

Ok, here why I joined the open-source army:

I abandoned the Windows programming scene wondering what is so good about GNU/Linux, so I decided to install. Well at first, the RedHat installation didn't work, so reading in the Australian PC-Authority magazine that Ubuntu was classed as a "Windows replacement", I decided to test that thesis. It was on an ANCIENT 450MHz IBM Aptiva, 64MB of SDRAM, only a 4Gb IDE HDD to share Windows 2000 Professional with, and a quirky--albeit capable--SiS 530 graphics chip that I managed to install Ubuntu 5.10 on.

At the time, I treated it more as an application; booting in to Ubuntu GNU/Linux when I had the spare time to test a few features, only to boot back in to Windows and continue on with work. Over the time, I got used to GNU/Linux, as the BASH prompt made me feel at home: I still used command.com in Windows for powerful file manipulation, plus, I was used to DOS since MSDOS 3.x. And just like any other WinHacker, I slowly used Windows less and Ubuntu GNU/Linux more until Microsoft inevitably got wiped off the hard drive.
