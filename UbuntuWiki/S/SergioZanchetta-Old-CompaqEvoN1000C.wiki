=== Current Issues ===
The Dimming/Brightness keys work erraticaly, and i cant work out a pattern
<<BR>>When the laptops on its docking station with a USB external hard drive plugged in and the ethernet is plugged in the hard drive unmounts/refuses to mount. Similiarly, when the drive is plugged in, the ethernet connection refuses to start
<<BR>>Cant seem to get hardware accelaration to work reliably/at all.
<<BR>>Havent tried, but IR doesnt seem to have worked out of the box.

If you have one with dapper check out suspend. It was disabled in software on mine, but the only problem i have had was the touchpad not working.

I have a PCMCIA wireless card, and it works 50% of teh time. the other 50% is hard lockups as soon as i try and active the card.

I have 3 Dockingstations, all slightly different. I havent tested many functions though (just Ethernet and audio), so these bits may not be accurate.
