=== Current Issues ===
Issues in Feisty: 

Wireless network card (SiS163U chip) doesn't work out of the box. I need ndiswrapper and the windows driver to get it working. 

Wireless network doesn't always work right after booting. My Wireless network (with WPA-personal encryption) is configured and should work, but most of the time i need a few tries to get it up. What do i do? Disable wireless network in network manager, shut down the wireless radio, bring back the wireless radio and enable wireless network again in network manager. Then I select my network again and if i'm lucky, it works. If anyone needs me to test/try anything to get this to work properly, you may contact me. I'm not a linux expert so i can only describe symptoms and test stuff people ask me to do ;)

Default screen resolution (1280x800) isn't automatically set after installation. After installation, i had a resolution of 1024x768. 

The keys for ajusting the brightness of the screen (FN+F8 and FN+F9) do not work.
