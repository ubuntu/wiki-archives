Being a social entrepreneur am constantly looking for creating business around FOSS especially Ubuntu. I believe FOSS is another chance for the developing world to bridge the divide because of the availability of source code which vast opportunity for real innovation.

I also believe in the philosophy of Ubuntu which stands out as a potential solution to most our current challenges.
