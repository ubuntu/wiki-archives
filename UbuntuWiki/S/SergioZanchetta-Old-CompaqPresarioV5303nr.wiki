==== Notes ====
*** 1: Requires proprietary drivers from video chipset manufacturer - provided in Ubuntu repositories. Open-source drivers do provide 3D acceleration but are not currently suitable for production or everyday use.
*** 2: Requires proprietary drivers from video chipset manufacturer - provided in Ubuntu repositories. Open-source drivers do not yet provide this functionality.
*** 3: Use of open-source driver requires proprietary firmware (unpredictable, but generally acceptable stability and performance) or use of ndiswrapper (stable; excellent performance). RF kill switch and indicator LED function properly.
*** 4: Requires proprietary commercial ($) driver from chipset manufacturer. Free "slmodem" driver will appear to work when used (responds to AT commands), until actually dialling out.
*** 5: Not recognized by lirc. Not listed in any hardware system information output. Device is physically present (location is behind the rightmost side of the front left LED panel) Heresay suggests device's existence is denied by Hewlett-Packard.
*** 6: Laptop does not have PCMCIA, rather one ExpressCard/54 slot.
