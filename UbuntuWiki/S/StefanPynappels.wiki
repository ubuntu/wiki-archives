=== About Me ===

I am a thirty something year old kid who still loves taking things apart and seeing how they work. Even my wife thinks I'm a geek, and I guess that is a positive thing in my eyes. I've been tinkering with computers ever since someone gave me an old PC running DOS way back in 1990, and I learned, mostly by trial and error, how it worked, and how to completely wipe it clean and start again. Although I went on to work with Windows systems after that, I was introduced to Linux about 10 years ago, and in some way it brought me back to those days of typing commands in to the computer, and learning why they did what they did. I have used a variety of distros since, for both server and desktop use, but always come back to Ubuntu, as it was one of my first and the one I developed my skills on most.

=== Contributions ===

While I work with Linux and specifically Ubuntu on a daily basis, mostly in server environments, I feel that my contribution to the community has been more of a helping nature. I have introduced quite a few people in my circle of friends to Ubuntu, including some so called silver surfers, people of advancing years who are now coming to the world of the internet and computers and who want simple interfaces with few security issues. It is immensely satisfying to see someone accessing the Internet for the first time on low spec hardware which I have lent them, and becoming proficient at communicating in this new way. It is also immensely satisfying to be able to tell them not to worry when they ask whether they should be worried about "these virus things" they hear about.

I also enjoy being a part of the community in the Ubuntu Forums. Most of my participation is in the Servers and Security Forums, as these are the areas which I come across most in my day-to-day work, and in which I feel I have the authority to provide accurate and helpful answers. I specifically try to help those who have issues with OpenVPN and other networking and routing issues, as well as those who have security fears, especially as new users coming from other OSs such as Windows. I like to think that I can calm people's fears and give them advice which really helps them to feel safe and secure as an Ubuntu user, much as I was helped by people like BodhiZazen and others when I was looking for information. I also feel that I can be a calming influence when discussions get heated, as they invariably do when discussing the pros and cons of different arguments, especially in the Security Forum. I am a realistic person who can see both sides of any argument, but I will do my best to ensure that any discussion is kept amicable and does not degenerate into personal attacks. Above all, I want to be a part of dispelling some of the Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt which surrounds Linux in general and Linux Security in particular, and see more people embrace the possibilities of Ubuntu.

My input in the Server Forums comes from my work running a large distributed farm of LAMP boxes running webapps, and I try to ensure that others can learn from my mistakes and help others with shortcuts which have made my life easier while managing 75+ separate Ubuntu servers on a variety of hardware as well as on virtual platforms all over the island of Ireland. I have found this forum to be invaluable to me when I'm trying to do something new, and I want to put something back and help others who are in the same position as I was.

=== Future Goals ===

I would also be very interested in becoming involved in documentation, both in creating it and in checking it for accuracy and grammar. I have seen how important good documentation is, especially when dealing with new users, and I feel that I can play a part in making the documentation as good as it can possibly be. I have started work on translating code strings as part of the English - UK team on Launchpad as part of this initiative.

I have also applied for Ubuntu Membership <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1753817|Forum Post]]</nowiki>
