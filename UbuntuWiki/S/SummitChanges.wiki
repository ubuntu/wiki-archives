=== Summary ===

The "summit system" is what we use for the Ubuntu Developer Summit. In the previous iteration of UDS we faced some problems with the system that need to be resolved. Summit is hosted at <nowiki>[[https://edge.launchpad.net/summit|lp:summit]]</nowiki>

=== Rationale ===

The summit system is showing it's age, as we increase the number of sessions, tracks, and people who schedule things it gets slower and more cumbersome to use. We would like to assign a developer to do some performance testing and add some small features for the next UDS.

=== Use Cases ===

** Matt is a track lead and runs into Joe in the hallway. Joe wants a session to be added to the schedule but doesn't need a blueprint. This is impossible to schedule.
** Amber has been tagged as a volunteer videographer for UDS but doesn't know how it matches her schedule. The summit system automatically tags and shows her which sessions she needs to videotape.
** David has been good about scheduling his sessions but as the new needs pile up he "cheats" and adds the session right into the Django admin interface since that's much easier than adding a blueprint and waiting for the system to import it into the session view. As a result he can't take advantage of the conflict resolution bits.
** Jono wants to ensure that people are mingling inbetween sessions, he wants assurances from the system that no 2 tracks are ever scheduled back to back in the same room.

=== Scope ===

These fixes are for UDS-M, anything after is out of scope.

=== Design ===

In order of importance:

===== Performance Work =====

''HIGH''

* Performance review - ISD added memcached support which improved the performance considerably. We need to perform a code review of the rendering and scheduling code to ensure it is working more efficiently.

===== Additional Data To Be Captured =====

''HIGH''

* A field for "crew" and "videographer"
** In the "Meeting" table there is a subtable that is called "Key People".
*** In addition to Drafter, Assignee, Approver, and Scribe, add a "Videographer1" and "Videographer2" field.
*** Use the system to schedule crew with the conflict resolution facility.
** Ability to tag an attendees record as "Crew" and then designate a day that they will be assigned crew duties. In the day view there should be a field on the calendar that shows who is going to be crew for that day so attendees know who the person is. Each role is then integrated into the person's personal view so it's on their schedule. (The "Hide talks that aren't for me" feature)

===== Design Review =====

''HIGH''

''Requires Design Team Input''.

* Bring summit.ubuntu.com up to speed with the branding and design of our other web properties. Mark has input on what he would like to see here.

===== Schedule Session Button =====

''MEDIUM''

''Requires Design Team Input''.

** Allow a scheduler to schedule a session on the fly without having to register a blueprint so people can schedule BoFs quickly.
** Clicking on the button will spawn a lightbox with 2 fields, title and description for the session and an ok/cancel button. <nowiki>[[attachment:summitbutton2.png|Mockup]]</nowiki>
*** Clicking on ok will accept the session and then add it to the sidebar, where the scheduler can schedule it.
*** Clicking cancel will take the user back to the normal view.
** When the session is on the sidebar it can be dragged into a time slot.

===== In Session Display Time =====

''LOW''

''Requires Design Team Input''.

*** When on display at UDS we need to have a clock on the schedule that won't scroll off so people can see where we are in the schedule. Ensure the page elements show up even on scroll, list of rooms, time slots, etc.

===== iCal Support =====

* Needed so we can have the IRC bot announce sessions in the channel
* Also useful for other calendaring facilities for attendees and for use in Lernid.

===== Admin Facilities =====

''LOW''

* Auto-generate the time slots. We run a SQL query to generate blank slots to drop sessions in, this is annoying, and making them by hand is time consuming.

==== Implementation Plan ====

TBD

=== Implementation ===

Currently assessing resourcing opportunities.
