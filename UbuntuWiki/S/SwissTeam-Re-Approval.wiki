== Re-Approval Application for Ubuntu Switzerland (ubuntu-ch) ==

<nowiki>[[File:SwissTeam/Artwork/ubuntu-ch_flag.svg]]</nowiki>

The Ubuntu SwissTeam is a group of enthusiastic people dedicated to spreading Ubuntu in Switzerland. We often get together at conventions, meetings, parties, and online

The team, which has been active for more than '''6 years''', consists of Ubuntu users from all over Switzerland. Our varied membership reflects the diversity of languages in Switzerland: French, German, Italian and Romansh.

For us, giving Ubuntu love and support doesn't stop at Switzerland's border. Many team members also participate in other groups on Launchpad such as Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Edubuntu, Documentation Team, German, French and Italian Translators, BugSquad and so on. 

Of course, quite a few of us are active Ubuntu members.

=== Roadmap ===

The Swiss Loco Team aims to promote Ubuntu and its flavors in Switzerland. This is done through:

* Install parties
* Stands at fairs
* Presentations and speeches at various events
* Regular meetings on IRC channel #ubuntu-ch
* Giving support, CDs and info in the various Swiss regions, in all Swiss languages + English. See also the list of <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SwissTeam/RegionalContacts|local contact]]</nowiki> persons grouped by location.
* Active collaboration in translations into German, French, Italian and, hopefully soon also Romansh.
* Regular Ubucons (maybe even an additional virutal Ubucon, but that's in early planning stage)
* Real-life meetings in different parts of the country (already happening in Zurich, on a regular basis)
