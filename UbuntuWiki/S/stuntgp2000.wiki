Email: 
I'm 26 and I'm a 100% GNU/Linux user now. I like to be around intelligent and motivated people. I'm pleased with the FOSS movement, I'm sure it's going to be a lifetime endeavor for me.

I've created this wiki because finally there some fun joining Arabic teams.

For now, I don't have much to say but you can visit one of my blogs:
