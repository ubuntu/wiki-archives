==== Notes ====
1. Need to use alternate 7.10 install disk, live CD hangs with corrupted display

2. Only 64 bit WEP is supported by the built in hardware.  Shared key authentication is supported.  Tests conducted with the standard Toshiba wireless card which is an Orinoco 

* Note that there's no internal microphone
* Internal wireless is a MiniPCI slot, allowing almost any WiFi card to work, (Klaus35: on my Toshiba Satellite Pro 4600 works an Cisco Aironet 350 MiniPCI, tested with Kubuntu 6.06 LTS)
* Ethernet is not passed through the port replicator
