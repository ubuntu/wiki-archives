 A SureType keyboard is a format created by Research in Motion ( RIM ). It has two letters per key insted of one (a full keyboard) or three (a cellphone keypad). Its purpose was to create a keyboard that was compact enough so that it could be fit on a small phone but would allow the user to type fast. The software that went along with it with it was meant to correct mistakes and improve typing speed by learning from your mistakes .
