==== Notes ====

The only items that cause me grief with this laptop are the card reader and the wireless NIC.  The card reader isn't very important to me since I don't use it much.  My digital camera has a CF card and the laptop doesn't read that type, so I use an external card reader or I plug the camera in directly.  The wireless NIC, on the other hand, I use every day.  I'm happy to report that Feisty works much better than the previous versions with this.  The actual chipset is Broadcom BCM4318.

One other note of interest is that this laptop comes with an 64-bit AMD Turion processor.  I use the 32-bit version of Ubuntu since there is better support for programs.  I found that by updating the BIOS to the latest version disables the use of 64-bit operating systems.  I don't know if HP did this on purpose or not, but I had to roll my BIOS back to F.11 in order to keep 64-bit OS support.
