__TOC__

SecondLife is a virtual world  run on Debian servers at LindenLabs,  which is accessed with a viewer or client allowing the user to have an immersive experience. There is an official viewer which runs on Linux, as well as libsecondlife, an Open Source library which allows creation of a FOSS viewer for SecondLife. There are future plans to open source the server software. This project is known as OpenSim. 

Inside the main grid of SecondLife, there is a Ubuntu User Group  who advocates for adoption of Ubuntu and provides support for people who are using Ubuntu to access SecondLife.It could be possible to form this group into a LoCo, or more accurately a SLCo as the SecondLife user base is as globally widespread as users of the flat internet.
