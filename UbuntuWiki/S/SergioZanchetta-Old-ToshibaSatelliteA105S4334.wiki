==== Notes ====
Apparently I cant find a way to find the keycode generated for the 'Fn' key  because, ONLY pressing the Fn key doesnt generate a key code.. Please go thru the following cases

command issued was 
$sudo showkey -u | tee -a hotkey-log.txt

O/P of just pressing the fn key
-------------------------------
kb mode was UNICODE

press any key (program terminates after 10s of last keypress)...
0x9c 

O/P of just pressing Esc key
----------------------------
kb mode was UNICODE

press any key (program terminates after 10s of last keypress)...
0x9c 
0x01 
0x81 

O/P of pressing Fn+Esc key
--------------------------
kb mode was UNICODE

press any key (program terminates after 10s of last keypress)...
0x9c 
0x01 
0x81 

This is the same with other keys, so Fn key is not able to be tracked by me..

I tried tail -f /var/log/acpid

but it dint give any o/p also...
