My name is Steven Day and I am work as a Java Programmer in New York City. My Linux experience goes all the way back to 1999 when I first installed Red Hat 6.0 on my desktop machine. Back then the Linux desktop was relatively very primitive and required a lot of know how to get around. For the next couple of years I was on and off with Linux, using it mainly as server machines.

I recently came to use Ubuntu in a VM in late 2006 after hearing so much about it. At the time I didn't want to abandon my Windows XP install but a hard drive failure on a March Saturday moved my hand. I had therefore decided to install the 6.10 CD I had downloaded and now I am more or less Windows Free at home. With the introduction of 7.04 for the desktop I have become even more happy and at home with the Linux desktop.

I will include more information here as I get time.
