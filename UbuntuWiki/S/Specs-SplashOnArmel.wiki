=== Summary ===

usplash should be supported for graphical boot on ARM (which is needed if fsck is run on the HDD)

=== Release Note ===

usplash is now supported in Ubuntu.

=== Rationale ===

usplash is supported on all other major Ubuntu desktop architectures (i386, amd64, lpia, powerpc). It should be supported on armel.

=== Design ===

* usplash already supports displaying over a framebuffer (used on powerpc)
* Its a matter of determining why usplash doesn't currently work on any ARM hardware we have

=== Implementation ===
* usplash might be removed from initramfs as it appears at the same time out of initramfs on fast arches; in our case initramfs / kernel startup is really slow so we might want to keep it in here
* find out if we need special casing to keep usplash in initramfs if the armel 
   platform provides to be slower during boot
** according to cjwatson that should be conditional based on architectures anyway, so no special casing is needed

=== Test/Demo Plan ===
* Boot Ubuntu/armel on supported hardware, see if usplash shows up

=== Unresolved issues ===
* Usplash should just work on Babbage/armel; no idea why it doesn't

=== BOF Notes ===

=== Goal ===

* Splash support for Karmic ARM SoCs (e.g. Babbage 2)

=== Current situation and changes planned for Karmic ===

* Plymouth not a requirement for KMS -- usplash works fine
* Usplash should just work on Babbage/armel; no idea why it doesn't
* KMS should just work on fb
* It's important to keep KMS support for the future (i.e. when we move to real
   drivers for the graphics on ARM SoCs)
* usplash might be removed from initramfs as it appears at the same time out of
   initramfs on fast arches; in our case initramfs / kernel startup is really
   slow so we might want to keep it in here

=== ACTIONS ===
* debug usplash on armel
** aparrently the issue is not in usplash itself but in /usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/init-top/framebuffer or the kernel config
* find out if we need special casing to keep usplash in initramfs if the armel 
   platform provides to be slower during boot
** according to cjwatson that should be conditional based on architectures anyway, so no special casing is needed
