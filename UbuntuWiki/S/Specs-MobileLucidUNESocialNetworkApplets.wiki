=== Summary ===

Discuss the possibility of adding social networking applets to Ubuntu Netbook Edition.  Need to define a specification for applets to be developed that allows for developers to add to the applet pool.

=== Release Note ===

=== Rationale ===

Today's networked user wants to be able to keep up with what is happening in the world.  Having an applet dock and applets will make Ubuntu Netbook Edition more comparable to other vendors solutions.
