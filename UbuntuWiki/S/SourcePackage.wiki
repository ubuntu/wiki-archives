__TOC__

A ''source package'' is the source archive of which on or more binary packages can be compiled. Those binary packages are most often referred to as just packages. 

Example: from <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nautilus|the source package 'nautilus']]</nowiki> the following binary packages are compiled:
* libnautilus-extension-dev
* libnautilus-extension1
* nautilus
* nautilus-data
* nautilus-dbg

=== Finding the source package ===
You can find the source package of a certain package with:
* The search box at the home page of <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/ubuntu|Ubuntu in Launchpad]]</nowiki>
* The command <code>apt-cache show ${package name} | grep ^Source:</code>
** ''If you get nothing from the previous command, the package name is the same as the name of the source package.''
