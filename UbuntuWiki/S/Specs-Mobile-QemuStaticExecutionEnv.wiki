__TOC__

* we have a qemu-static-arm binary that allows you to build arm binaries
   on a x86 box; this is done in a chroot having the qemu-static binary;
   kernel does magic and uses binfmt to wrap armel binaries
* idea: use this approach to support even more environments:
** candidates: mips, powerpc, m68k; basically all archs
*** cell architecture -> playstation
* idea: build single binary that supports all archs
** does binfmt support that? ogra says: feels hard; loic thought yes, but
     confirmed that it doesnt work.
* no options to not use the static binaries: we want to use it in chroot
   without copying loads of libraries to the chroot
** but this feels heavy weight
* ogra: we do not want to use full emulation -> must keep using the syscall emulation
* loic: wants to use the shared qemu builds, by copying libs to the appropriate
   multiarch directory (e.g. /usr/lib/i486-linux-gnu)
* qemu-arch-static
* does multiarch help that llows to build a foreign system?
** install qemu emulation and x86 binary in your chroot
* 

Actions:
* investigate whether one can build a single binaries that supports all archs
** -> loic found that this does not work
* loic to document non static approach
** -> done, see <nowiki>[[Research]]</nowiki>
* ogra to document -static approach and prepare patches -> send to
* propose -static patches to upstream debootstrap side by side with the idea
   of loic being documented as a backup/clean/longterm plan.
** in case we want -static for users that do not have a chroot, we can
     probably keep it as it does not buy us maintaining a diff against debian
     debootstrap.
