'''ClaasTeichmann:'''
I installed Ubuntu 7.10 (Gutsy Gibbon) using the alternate-CD, then I upgraded to Ubuntu 8.04 (Hardy Heron) via the upgrade-manager.

'''<nowiki>[[Hirvinen]]</nowiki>:'''
I installed Ubuntu 7.10 (Gutsy Gibbon) using <nowiki>[[http://lubi.sourceforge.net/unetbootin.html|UNetbootin]]</nowiki>, since I did not have an optical drive. This worked fine for me, but note that this is an unsupported method. At least back up your data. See <nowiki>[[Installation]]</nowiki>.
I then upgraded to Ubuntu 8.04 (Hardy Heron).
 ----
'''<nowiki>[[Kogen]]</nowiki>:'''
I installed Ubuntu 8.04 using the desktop-CD. Everything is working fine.

==== Notes ====
===== Resolution =====
* After the installation the resolution seems to be correct although System/Preferences/Screen Resolution shows 1200x1024 instead of 1280x800. This can be corrected via <code>displayconfig-gtk</code>

===== Harddrive =====

* Noises originating from the harddrive seem to be originating from a problem with the power-saving settings of the harddisk. The problem is discussed <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/acpi-support/+bug/59695|here (bug 59695)]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/104535|here (bug 104535)]]</nowiki>
* I used the following work-around taken from <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/acpi-support/+bug/59695|here (bug 59695)]]</nowiki>:
## make a file named "99-hdd-spin-fix.sh". The important thing is starting with "99".
## make sure the file contains the following 2 lines:
<pre>
hdparm -B 255 /dev/sda
</pre>
1. copy this file to 3 locations:
<pre>
/etc/acpi/suspend.d/
/etc/acpi/resume.d/
/etc/acpi/start.d/
</pre>

===== Touchpad =====
This is not a synaptics touchpad, so the nice utilities for configuring those don't work. So far I haven't been able to disable the bit too sensitive tap-to-click feature or turn this completely off. Will post here if I find a solution.

===== Bluetooth =====
According to Dell's driver downloads page D430 has a Dell 360 bluetooth module. I got it to work partially by installing the newest Windows driver (on Windows) from Dell's support page. (workaround discovered thanks to http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=572335 ) The bluetooth device disappears on suspend-to-ram though.

===== Card reader =====
The card reader works now(2008-03-29) without having to do anything extra. A month ago it was necessary to issue command "sudo modprobe sdhci" before it would work.

===== Fingerprint reader =====
To use biometric authentication install and configure ThinkFinger.
