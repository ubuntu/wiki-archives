==== Ubuntu Contribution ====

===== Local Community =====

My main involvement within the Ubuntu community, with no doubt, is in the Israeli local community.<<BR>>
I am very active within the LoCo: serving as a moderator of the forums, site, mailing list.
I am also the owner of the launchpad group.<<BR>>
Beyond that, i am supporting Israeli users on the forums and IRC channel.
In January of 2011 I was elected as the Israeli Point of Contact.

===== IRC =====

I am supporting Ubuntu beginners in #ubuntu-beginners when i can, though i haven't officially  joined the team.

The reason I don't participate in #ubuntu is that it's just over crowded for me (see <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/empathy/+bug/392799|Bug #392799]]</nowiki>)

On #ubuntu-il, the Israeli LoCo channel, i am serving as an OP for more then a year now. Additional to that, I support Israeli users on that channel, hours a day.

As I am a part of the ubuntu-youth council, I am serving as an OP on #ubuntu-youth and #ubuntu-youth-council.

===== Translation =====

I am translating English to Hebrew in <nowiki>[[https://translations.launchpad.net/~serfus|Rosetta]]</nowiki>. 

I have translated a bunch of docs such as:
 i. <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/IRC/Guidelines|IRC Guidelines]]</nowiki>
 i. <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LoCoCouncil|the LoCo Council page]]</nowiki>
 i. <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LoCoCouncil/LoCoTeamsBestPracticesandGuidelines|the Best Practices and Guidelines]]</nowiki>
 i. DoctorMo's <nowiki>[[http://doctormo.org/2010/07/26/how-to-ask-for-translations|how to ask smart questions]]</nowiki>
 i. <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/IRC/TermsOfService|IRC Terms Of Service]]</nowiki>
 i. <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Translations/Wanted/UbuntuOneEmail|Ubuntu One Email]]</nowiki>
 i. <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Translations/Wanted|Desktop entries for LibreOffice]]</nowiki>

===== Bugs =====

I have recently joined the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~bugsquad|Bug Squad team]]</nowiki>, and it's my first ever encounter with the tech side of a OS, therefore I am still learning and hoping to start triaging and kick some bugs buttocks!

==== my targets and hopes for the future ====

* localizing Ubuntu
One of my main desires is to help make Ubuntu fully and completely translated into Hebrew so that Ubuntu will be available to the Israeli public who doesn't understand English.<<BR>>
more then translating, I do what I can in order to help the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-il|Israeli LoCo team]]</nowiki> develop and to spread Ubuntu in Israel.

* Ubuntu-Youth
The <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuYouth|Ubuntu Youth]]</nowiki> is a project i have joined not long ago. the idea is fantastic: helping and teaching the younger ones how to use Ubuntu, as the community side as well. teaching them how to use the forums,IRC and launchpad, help them getting involved in the community... all that will be taught by youths so this project promotes in a couple of ways. <<BR>>
the reason i think this project is so awesome is that we can show the youngsters they have alternative to windows. <<BR>>
I hope to keep on with the project and get those youth excited about Ubuntu as i am ;)

==== Testimonials ====

''If you have anything to say about me and my involvement with ubuntu, please go ahead and do so here.''

* I know serfus from the Israeli community and even though i don't know him very well i think he can contribute a lot to the community, he is helping if and when he can on the chat and the forum, and doing his job as the OP on the chat the best he can. <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:Moshenahmias]]</nowiki>
* Aviv been a very helpful user to the community, he's always help where he can. He was chosen by the community, and I for a good reason. good luck! <nowiki>[[Ddorda]]</nowiki>
