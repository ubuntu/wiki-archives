=== Idea ===

The basic idea is that it's not good enough to just be able to search for someone and sign their key etc to say you know them, we also need a way to automate the workflow so a person can initiate a signing event and have that event appear on the other person's desktop.

See the Design spec for more information. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Starfish/Design

=== Possible Routes ===

* Use XMPP
* Use Email
* Use XMPP limited to local network (people near me)
