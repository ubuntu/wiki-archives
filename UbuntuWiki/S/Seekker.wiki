Hello,

I'm a self-employed female 'geek' [for lack of a better word] in the Northeast Ohio area.  Once Vista was released I decided to permanently migrate to 'nix.  Right now, I'm working with Kubuntu.  I'm looking at being able to offer my customers a 'non-windows' alternative, and Ubuntu seems to be a viable candidate.  I also like the super abundance of friendly support that Ubuntu has.
