== Testing debootstrap with local packages ==

=== Purpose ===

I needed to test the effects of a package during bootstrap.  I wanted to
use a custom built package with debugging and fixes added.

=== Steps ===
<pre>
sudo debootstrap --foreign precise precise
sudo cp *.deb precise/var/cache/apt/archives/
sudo chroot precise debootstrap/debootstrap --second-stage
</pre>

The packages can print outout to /tmp files, and it can also be helpful to

<pre>
sudo strace -f -o/tmp/log chroot precise debootstrap/debootstrap --second-stage
</pre>
