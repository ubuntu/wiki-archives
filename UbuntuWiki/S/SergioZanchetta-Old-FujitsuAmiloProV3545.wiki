==== Notes ====

My main concern was the cpu and hdd temperature. Have not done any "hard work" yet but it seems that acpi keeps temperature under good control(under 50 C).<<BR>>

Battery autonomy is somewhere arround 2 hours.<<BR>> 

* When you use headphones the speakers are not muted.<<BR>>
* Sleep does not work! Im still working on it!<<BR>>
