=== Week of June 22, 2009 ===

To do this week:
1. Brainstorm alternative layouts
** What is the functionality/hierarchy:
** stuff they already have (#) (my apps, my software, my library, etc)
*** currently downloading (#)
*** completed (#) (this is also history?)
*** updates
** stuff they can get
*** applications/packages
*** other non-package things
*** updates (go here?)
** other things of relevance (feeds, etc)
** feedback (this would be really nice and if given good real estate might actually be used, it is unlikely that a novice could navigate the existing bug reporting system)
** What about 3d manipulations, compiz?
** Screenshots
** Current add/remove - http://sydney.indymedia.org.au/files/sydimc/images/ubuntu-add-remove.img_assist_custom.png
** Miro - as discussed, this is a really nice, engaging example of a discovery/management platform (http://www.getmiro.com/download/screenshots/)
** torrent browser - boring, but I like the way "state" is clearly handled, although miro has cleaned this whole idea up and presented it nicely (http://images.snapfiles.com/screenfiles/uTorrent.gif)
** hulu desktop - a nice discovery platform, and relatively novel browsing interface (http://www.freewaregenius.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/hulu-desktop-screenshot6.jpg)
** netflix online - nice job with grouping and presenting items for browsing in an engaging and actionable way (http://www.hundred10.com/img/screen-netflix1.jpg)
** vuze - reduction of a ton of content types into something more manageable (http://linux.softpedia.com/screenshots/Vuze_1.jpg)
** Microsoft media center - good presentation of items for browsing with interesting animation effects (http://www.screenshots-archive.com/files/images/image082.preview.png)
** Flickr "clock" - this is really cool way to associate time with content/changes (http://www.flickr.com/explore/clock/)
1.#2 List of tasks for usability testing
** software updates - can we make this happen "naturally" in the test and see reactions? ie - have it notify them (highlighted somehow in nav, popup?), then go through the process
** ..
** ...

3. Canonical brainstorm session feedback
