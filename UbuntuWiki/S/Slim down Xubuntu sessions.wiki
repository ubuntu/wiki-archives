__TOC__

This page is to discuss and list ideas for this <nowiki>[[https://blueprints.launchpad.net/xubuntu-desktop/+spec/xubuntu-karmic-session-slim-down|specification.]]</nowiki> For Karmic, it is planned to make Xubuntu lighter by choosing applications which use less resources.

=== Suggested Applications ===

* Claws Mail to replace Mozilla Thunderbird
* VLC to replace Totem (however, it maybe important to consider that VLC uses qt4.)
* Xfce Power Manager to replace Gnome Power Manager
* Xfce Task Manager to replace Gnome System Monitor
* Xfce-notifyd to replace Notification Daemon
* Xfburn to replace Brasero
* Midori installed by default, I would not recommend replacing it with Firefox. Midori does not have all the features as Firefox and is very buggy (crashes when loading certain webpages, open/closing tabs).
