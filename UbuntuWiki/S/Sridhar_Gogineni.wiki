Ubuntu is in my humble opinion the easiest and best way to switch from Windows to a free and open-source operating system. In order to make your transition easier, and to help those that have started using ubuntu. I am started using ubuntu nearly 5 years and i want to share my experiences and some useful information to ubuntu lovers.I am also webmaster for http://www.ubuntugeek.com.

I am a member of Beta test team member.Testing beta build and reporting any bugs.

I am also ubuntu forum member with username gg234 helping Users to fix their problems.
