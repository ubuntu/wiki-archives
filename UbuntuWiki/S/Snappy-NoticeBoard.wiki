== Snappy Noticeboard ==

Most of the discussion happens on IRC (<nowiki>[[https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=snappy|#snappy on freenode]]</nowiki>) or on the mailing lists (<nowiki>[[lists.ubuntu.com-mailman-listinfo-snappy-devel|snappy-devel]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[lists.ubuntu.com-mailman-listinfo-snappy-app-devel|snappy-app-devel]]</nowiki>). 

We still want to offer a central place, where we share what people are working on, so we can collaborate on things and stay up to date on what's happening. This is a great place to share a branch you're working on, a project your snappyfying. Here you should be able to find helpers, testers and co-hackers.

=== Notice board ===

If you add an entry, please add a link to something like your Launchpad profile, so people know how to get in touch with you.
