=== About Me ===

My name is Sergio Agudelo, I'm studying Mechatronical Engineering at <nowiki>[[http://www.unal.edu.co/|Universidad Nacional de Colombia]]</nowiki> since 2009. I started using Linux less than a year, with the Wubi installer (Ubuntu Maverick). Hoping to help improving the libre software usage in my country.
