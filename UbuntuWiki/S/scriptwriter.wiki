Hi all,

I'm Scriptwriter, a new Ubuntero. I've been using Ubuntu for 2 months full-time. I decided to be a member of Ubuntu community and contribute to its growth. I've joined Vietnamese Team and now I'm in process of localization some packages ;-) This is my first online collaboration project.

A few words about me. I'm a first year NUS student, majoring in Computer Engineering (hardware-oriented). I speak Vietnamese, Russian, English, Ukranian and a bit Mandarin ;-) My hobby is programming. Javascript, Perl and PHP are my favorite languages. Do some IT freelancing jobs. Have interest and experience in cryptography.
