__TOC__

Currently learning php with the intent of moving up to perl and C++, and getting a better understanding of the open source world - hopefully to develop projects of great interest such as graphics and games for Linux.

Some simple projects I have developed include "the unblockable website" - to be taken with a pinch of salt:

http://unblocked.t35.com

Created to introduce the freedom of webchat into oppressive school & library internet filters. The site appears to be subject orientated research, but at the bottom of each page is an internal frame with an index of downloads and a chat link. Of course, there is nothing to prevent a sysadmin simply blocking the site...
