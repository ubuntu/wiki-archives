== What can I do to help ? ==

There are different areas where you can help the Ubuntu Security Team.

=== Help on the mailing list and the IRC channel ===
You can lend a hand with people's questions and problems on the mailing list and the IRC channel:
* subscribe to <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-hardened|ubuntu-hardened mailing list]]</nowiki>.
* hang out in #ubuntu-security (aka #ubuntu-hardened) on the Libera Chat IRC.
* participate in IRC workshops on security during UbuntuDeveloperWeek

=== Write documentation ===
<nowiki>[[SecurityTeam-FAQ| FAQ]]</nowiki> items and <nowiki>[[SecurityTeam-KnowledgeBase|KnowledgeBase]]</nowiki> areas need to be written.  See the <nowiki>[[SecurityTeam-Roadmap| Roadmap]]</nowiki> for details.

=== Test security features ===
Testing the existing security features of Ubuntu can done to improve both documentation and to help find bugs. You can also <nowiki>[[SecurityTeam-Specifications|test and participate in the development of new security features]]</nowiki> that are being developed.

=== Find security bugs ===
Find new security issues in existing Ubuntu software. If you find something, <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingSecurity#How%20to%20File|file a bug]]</nowiki>.

=== Triage security bugs ===
Go through the list of security bugs in Ubuntu, and <nowiki>[[SecurityTeam-BugTriage|triage]]</nowiki> them.

=== Fix security bugs ===
Review open security bugs, find/write patches, build and test the fixes. Providing patches for security vulnerabilities is an excellent way to learn about Ubuntu processes and develop the skills necessary to become an <nowiki>[[UbuntuDevelopment|Ubuntu developer]]</nowiki>. Please see <nowiki>[[SecurityTeam-UpdateProcedures|UpdateProcedures]]</nowiki> for details.

Ubuntu shares many of the same source packages as Debian, so in addition to applying patches to Ubuntu from upstream sources, people can also get involved by performing merges from Debian. A list of potential candidates can be found in the <nowiki>[[http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/d2u/|D2U CVE tracker]]</nowiki>. For more information on merging, see <nowiki>[[UbuntuDevelopment-Merging|UbuntuDevelopment-Merging]]</nowiki>.

=== Develop new security features ===
The Wishlist section of the <nowiki>[[SecurityTeam-Roadmap|Roadmap]]</nowiki> has many great ideas for new improvements to be made to Ubuntu's security.

== How to become a member of the Ubuntu Security Team ==

The Ubuntu Security Team really consists of three sub-teams:

* <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~motu-swat|motu-swat]]</nowiki>: this team creates and tests security updates in Universe packages
** to become a member, help with Universe security updates for a while, and then get the approval of one of the team administrators.
* <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-hardened|ubuntu-hardened]]</nowiki>: this team develops and tests proactive security features in Ubuntu.
** to become a member, just <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-hardened/+join|apply for membership]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-security|ubuntu-security]]</nowiki>: this is a closed team responsible for performing security update publications
