__TOC__

This pages list all the packages in the Mer OBS archive which needs to be added/merged/synched to the ubuntu repo.

Packages in this list are in the Mer OBS archive for one or both these reasons:

* package is not in ubuntu
* package have been patched or modified from the ubuntu version

If you want to collaborate you should:
1. grab a package from the list
2. download the Mer version of the package from the <nowiki>[[http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Maemo://Mer://0.14/Ubuntu_9.04/ |Mer OBS repo]]</nowiki>
3. download the same package from from Ubuntu Jaunty repo.
4. Check both packages and track differences (diff -Naru will help you in this stuff)

What to do next with the .diff(s) have not decided yet, they could:
5.#5 be merged in one package and add a package-mer stanza which will apply the differences found into mer packages. So when building there will be at least two debs, one which is packagename and one which is packagename-mer.
6. Be uploaded to REVU
7. Added to ubuntu repo
