how to use bzr and quilt to update GPM packaging
1) mkdir where you'll work
2) cd into it and run your "bzr lp:~..."
3) cd into the created folder
4) bzr bd-do (will create shell, exit 0 saves work and non-zero will delete it)
5) quilt push or quilt push <your filename>.patch
6) if it fails, repeat with -f "quilt push -f"
7) quilt refresh (optional, this will change your patch to include any changes it had to do to make your patch fit)
8) check the .rej files and edit the failed hunks manually.
9) when done editing, quilt refresh
10) quilt pop (will take off the changes from the patch)
11) quilt push (will make sure your patch is properly added)
12) exit 0
13) dch -vNewVersion -D UNRELEASED
14) debcommit
15) push back to bzr
