* Problems with the WLAN, it does not find essids, not clearly locatable  
* The hardware volume switch does not work (but software does)

== Notes ==

=== Audio ===

The mixer (kmix) gets much more settings and the internal speakers mute when plugging a head phone, if you give the audio driver a hint concerning the model of your notebook: add the following line "options snd-hda-intel model=basic" to the file "/etc/modprobe.d/options” and restart (changing the option on a running system is possible but much more complicated). Maybe there is a even better option, but with this one, it works.

=== Wireless ===

Currently only the manual configuration works, no nm, no wicd, no wlassistent. It does not recognize the essid, it does not connect
 
=== Card Reader ===

To use sd-cards with the build-in card reader, add the following lines to the file "/etc/modules" <pre>
   tifm_sd
   tifm_7xx1
   tifm_core</pre>
