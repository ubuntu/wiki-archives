Home page: http://kitone.free.fr/subtitleeditor/

Uses GTK+ and <nowiki>[[ScreenCasts/GStreamer|GStreamer]]</nowiki>, written mostly in C, Subtitle Editor is still actively developed and is the only editor to feature an waveform analyser and embedded preview window of the movie file with subtitle preview capabilities. It's support of dynamic keyboard shortcuts and the benefit of the video timeline, which is similar to most video editors, is enough to make this currently my recommended editor.

Whilst a stable version is available in the repository (0.12.4-1 in Feisty), as it is under development, you may prefer to get the latest features by compiling the source code. Instructions can be found on the project web page linked above.
