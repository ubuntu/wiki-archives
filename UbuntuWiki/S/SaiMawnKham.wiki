=== About Me ===

May I say you hello, I am Sai Mawn Kham. I am Buddhist, Original Buddhist. I am Shan race in Myanmar (Burma). I am not only a teacher but also an author. I love to teach about IT and write about IT in my native language, Shan. Our Shan people was lack of improve in Education. I am trying to be a good Teacher, best distributor of Education for my people around The Shan State in Myanmar. So I find the ways to help my people in a couple of years. Especially I want to share about IT to my Shan people a lot and a lot. Coz all we are live in IT environment, IT age. We can't stand without Computer Technology. We needs it indeed. Coz the kinds of Buddha I met <nowiki>[[kokoye2007]]</nowiki> in May but I have known him online long time ago. However, I have just met him face to face in May, 2011. The place, where we met was the border of Myanmar in Muse, Shan State. In November, 2011 he advised me to establish Ubuntu Shan LoCo Team as they have <nowiki>[[MyanmarTeam|Ubuntu Myanmar LoCo team]]</nowiki>. Tail that time I don't know well what is Ubuntu?  Why should we try?. After that he explained me all the purpose and activities that they are made. So then I found the way to carry my people to the best way we should walk with. Since then I founded Ubuntu Shan LoCo Team . With the born of Ubuntu Shan LoCo Team I travelled all around The Shan State in Myanmar. I have done many of Ubuntu Hours, Introduction with Ubuntu and other activities for Ubuntu communities. And I wrote "The Perfect Desktop - Ubuntu 12.04" && "Ubuntu Beginner Guide" in my native language, Shan. I have to build Shan Localisation Team to localised Ubuntu in my native language, Shan. Its a great dream not only for me but also for my people. So that I planned to share and distribute more about Ubuntu to my people.
