I have been trying to get involved with writing code for an Ubuntu project this year. I read with great interest about Jonos project and decided to get stuck in :)  I am fairly new to getting involved with development, but that has not phased me at all.  I have found the atmosphere very welcoming and the patience amazing by the groups members. Without their support I do not think I could have got very far. So far I have written 3 Ubuntu Accomplishments, but others are in the pipeline.
