__TOC__

=== Introduction ===

Several things need to be shown to the user and interacted with, but have more logic than what can be contained in a simple notification.  These are dialogs that should visually look like system items, but are driven by services outside of the shell directly.  All clients of this interface will be whitelisted and it will be a very restricted list.  Input to these dialogs should be considered sensitive to avoid spoofing of things like passwords.
