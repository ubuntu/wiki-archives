__TOC__

=== Summary ===

 Meeting Summaries and Logs should be easy to find and discover for everyone. People should be able to visit one location to get the log or summary for any meeting or special event within the Ubuntu community.  

=== Scope ===

 The Scribes Team will collect summaries of all meetings and events posted on the wiki. These summaries will be listed on a wiki page. The Scribes Team will make every effort to help gather missing logs and create missing summaries.
 

=== Design ===
 The listing of councils, boards, teams and derivs will be catagozied. These will link to the teams meeting log and/or summary page or into the directory where Scribes Team copies will be kept. Every attempt will be kept to ensure the listing pages are not too long.

 Some design direction is outlined in <nowiki>[[ScribesTeam/SubmitMeeting]]</nowiki>.

=== Possible issues ===
 Adjusting current desing and layout to the new version. 
** Adjusting some links... 
** Duplicating some content...
