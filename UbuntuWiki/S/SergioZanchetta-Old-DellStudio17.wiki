=== Current Issues ===

1. In Intrepid, the keyboard works correctly.  In previous releases, the following may apply:

The numbers on the numeric keypad do not work.  The "5" key produces mouse button 3, and the "+" key produces mouse button 1.  The other number keys do not appear to register at all, but the numpad <enter> key works as it should.  These effects are the same whether num lock is on or off, and they carry over to the USB desktop keyboard plugged into it.

Nov08 Solution: change System/Preferences/Keyboard/model to Dell 101-key; then on the same screen in Other options Change Numeric keypad layout selection to "Keypad with Unicode additions".  Numlock light still not working, but the Numlock key now switches between arrow keys and number keypad.

2. sound not very loud- in some applications only.

3. In Intrepid, wireless works fine, using the broadcom STA driver.  In previous releases: WEP works; WPA doesn't.  Possibly a router issue and not Ubuntu.

4. Fingerprint reader: No driver currently(Nov 08) under development for Linux (see <nowiki>[[http://www.reactivated.net/fprint/wiki/Libfprint|libfprint]]</nowiki> page)

5. Microphone(s) do not work.  I think there is a built-in microphone by the webcam, and there is a microphone jack, and neither appear to work.

==== Notes ====

Using the open source driver, the GNOME control panel for extending/mirroring the desktop onto an external monitor works well using the SVGA port.  Using the ATI driver, it seems to be more tricky -- the GNOME and KDE controls no longer work, but there is the ATI Catalyst control panel which seems to partly work.

Turning off the laptop screen by closing the case also shuts down the SVGA screen.

The HDMI port is as yet untested.  

When entering hibernate or suspend mode, often a popping sound is heard, like a power arc.  This does not appear to happen in a normal shutdown.

Nov 08 8.10: Hibernate key (Fn-F1) partially works.  Mouse movement persists; left or right clicking usually doesn't.

Battery: The Gnome power manager is installed (on a GNOME desktop) by default, and functions.  To see battery status all the time, unplug the laptop to visualise the panel applet, right click it and select always visible in the General options.

Sound: the headphone jacks work, but the builtin speaker does not turn off, unless you add the following to /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base and reboot.

options snd-hda-intel model=dell-m6

I have not yet succeeded in recording using the builtin microphone or the microphone jack.
