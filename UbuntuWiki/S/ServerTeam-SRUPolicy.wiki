StableReleaseUpdates (SRU) are package updates to fix critical bugs in
supported releases.

=== Getting Involved ===

Here are some tasks to get involved in the SRU process:

==== SRU preparation ====
Grab a bug from the <nowiki>[[http://people.canonical.com/~chucks/SRUTracker/sru-tracker-bugs.html#unassigned|list of accepted bugs]]</nowiki>, assign it to yourself and
prepare a Stable Release Update:
## Prepare a new package to upload to -proposed.
## Update the bug with a proper SRU report.

==== SRU verification ====

Test bugs from the <nowiki>[[list of verification-needed bugs]]</nowiki> in order to validate an SRU from -proposed and move it to -updates.

TODO: verification-needed bug links.

=== Process overview ===

The Ubuntu Server team process to track potential SRU candidates and turn them
into proposed updates looks like this:

<nowiki>[[File:sru_process-0.1.png]]</nowiki>

=== SRU states ===

A SRU can be in the following states:

=== Weekly bug suggestions review ===

A list of suggested bugs for SRU is sent out to the ubuntu-server mailing on a
weekly review to request feedback on relevant bugs.

Weekly suggestions email template:

Subject: Weekly suggestions of bugs for Stable Release Updates

Howdy,

We'd like to get your suggestions on the bugs listed below that may be
considered for a Stable Release Update [1] by the Ubuntu Server team if
they meet the SRU criteria.

== SRU criteria ==

As outlined in the Stable Release Updates Policy [1], Stable Release
Updates will, in general, only be issued in order to fix *high-impact*
bugs.

[1]: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates#When

Examples of such bugs include:

 A. Bugs which may, under realistic circumstances, directly cause a security
    vulnerability. These are done by the Ubuntu Security Team.

 B. Bugs which represent severe regressions from the previous release of
    Ubuntu. This includes packages which are totally unusable, like being
    uninstallable or crashing on startup.

 C. Bugs which may, under realistic circumstances, directly cause a loss of
    user data.

 D. Bugs which do not fit under above categories, but (1) have an obviously
    safe patch and (2) affect an application rather than critical
    infrastructure packages (like X.org or the kernel).

 E. For Long Term Support releases we regularly want to enable new hardware.
    Such changes are appropriate provided that we can ensure to not affect
    upgrades on existing hardware. For example, modaliases of newly introduced
    drivers must not overlap with previously shipped drivers.

 F. FTBFS (Fails To Build From Source) can also be considered. Please note
    that in main the release process ensures that there are no binaries which
    are not built from a current source. Usually those bugs should only be 
    SRUed in conjunction with another bug fix.

For new upstream versions of packages which provide new features, but don't fix
critical bugs, a backport [2] should be requested instead.

=== SRU tracking DB ===

Each SRU is tracked in database in order to be able to calculate the age of
each state it has been in. Scripts generate bug lists for each state on a
regular basis and store the results into a local DB.

The SRU tracking DB is managed by scripts from the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/server-sru-tracker|Server SRU tracker project]]</nowiki> on Launchpad.

=== SRU tracking page ===

<nowiki>[[http://people.canonical.com/~chucks/SRUTracker/sru-tracker-bugs.html|The SRU tracking page]]</nowiki> lists the bugs currently under SRU, their state and how long they've been into that state.
