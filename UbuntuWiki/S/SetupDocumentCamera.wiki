'''Task name:''' 
Provide instructions so that Document cameras work on Ubuntu ThinClients

'''Description:''' 
Document cameras are very useful classroom tools in conjunction with a data projector. Student work can be easily put under the doc camera and shared with the class.  This holds true with book illustrations as well as 3D objects. Also, one can do work under the doc camera, and take either stills or videos, store and post them for student access on the internet.  In a ComputerLab it can be used as an image capture device where the file is uploaded to a common network location then downloaded by the student to use in their project.
