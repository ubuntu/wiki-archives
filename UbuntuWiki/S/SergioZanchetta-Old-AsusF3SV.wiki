=== Notes ===

===== Webcam Installation =====
The Webcam should work without any additional drivers on Ubuntu 8.04 (Hardy Heron). For older installations, use the following instructions.
These instructions are based on the original instructions I found <nowiki>[[http://www.zer0.net/#2420624065135683357|here]]</nowiki> (The Dec.14 2007 post). 

First download version 1.2.3 of the drivers from http://syntekdriver.sourceforge.net/ to your home dir. Now open a terminal (Applications>Accessories>Terminal) and type in the following:
   ''sudo apt-get install ctags''

   ''tar xvf stk11xx-1.2.3.tar.gz''

   ''cd stk11xx-1.2.3''

   ''wget http://bookeldor-net.info/merdier/Makefile-syntekdriver''

   ''make -f Makefile.standalone''

   ''sudo make -f Makefile-syntekdriver install''

   ''sudo modprobe stk11xx''

Now the drivers should be loaded properly. To test it out either install camorama (''sudo apt-get install camorama'') or open up Ekiga. If you use Ekiga you'll have to go through the configuration Druid. When you get either program running, there should be a green light on next to the lens. And you should see a video in the proper window.

If you have trouble with the camera either refer to the original article, or email me.

===== Fingerprint Reader =====
These instructions are based on the original instructions found <nowiki>[[http://www.reactivated.net/fprint/wiki/Main_Page|here]]</nowiki>

Download  and install the following files in this order:
 <nowiki>[[http://ppa.launchpad.net/madman2k/ubuntu/pool/main/libf/libfprint/libfprnt0_0.0.5-2ubuntu1_i386.deb|libfprint0_0.0.5-2ubuntu1_i386.deb]]</nowiki>
 <nowiki>[[http://ppa.launchpad.net/madman2k/ubuntu/pool/main/p/pam-fprint/libpam-fprint_0.2-2ubuntu1_i386.deb|libpam-fprint_0.2-2ubuntu1_i386.deb]]</nowiki>
 <nowiki>[[http://ppa.launchpad.net/madman2k/ubuntu/pool/main/f/fprint-demo/fprint-demo_0.4-0ubuntu1~ppa2_i386.deb|fprint-demo_0.4-0ubuntu1~ppa2_i386.deb]]</nowiki>

Now with the proper files installed, run this command in a terminal:
<pre>
gksudo fprint_demo
</pre>
In the new window you can enroll your fingerprints and test out how well it sees your finger print.

To configure PAM to use the fingerprint reader for login and other authentication you have to enroll your fingerprint in the PAM module. To do this, run this command in a terminal:

<pre>
sudo pam_fprint_enroll --enroll-finger 7
</pre>

This command is for use with your right index finger. For a list of codes for other fingers, add a '-h' to above command. Next insert this line into your /etc/pam.d/common-auth file:

<pre>
auth          sufficient      pam_fprint.so
</pre>

This should be put in right before the line that says "auth required pam_unix.so". Now when you are asked for authentication, like on the login screen or when sudo is used, you can simply slip you finger across the fingerprint reader.

I have had some issues with this setup, mostly not being able to use gksudo properly. This could probably be fixed by entering the pam config line above in a different file.
