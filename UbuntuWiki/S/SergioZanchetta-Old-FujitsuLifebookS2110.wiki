==== Notes ====
Nothing with power management seems to work.  I haven't done ''extensive'' testing, I have just been using it for a while.  3D acceleration worked in Breezy, but I haven't gotten around to fixing it in Edgy yet.

Feisty tested in 64-bit version. To make suspend work you have to use uswsusp (s2ram and s2disk). 3D acceleration works with ATI binary drivers. Volume control keys are recognized, but Master and Headphones channels are swapped in ALSA, as a workaround you can set (in kmix in KDE) Headphones channel to be master. Brightness control keys work out of the box. You can also dim monitor in software way: sudo su; echo NUMBER > /proc/acpi/video/VGA/LCD/brightness - NUMBER is between 1 and 8.
