== Introduction ==

General design for all syncing phones, PDAs and other devices (hardware only) supported by opensync and other sync engines.

== Method ==

The idea is to provide a sync capability and all information required for a client (in this case conduit) to take advantage of any sync enabled device plugged in.

== Information Required ==

The following Keys should be inserted into any device '''Interface''' (not the device itself) which has sync capabilities:

<pre>
<append key="info.capabilities" type="strlist">sync</append>
<merge key="usb.interface.description" type="string">Thingy Data Provider</merge>
<merge key="info.category" type="string">phone</merge>
<merge key="sync.protocol" type="string">obex</merge>
<merge key="sync.name"   type="string">Thingy Mobile Phone</merge>
<merge key="sync.serial" type="string">H23F775B</merge>
</pre>

== Information Optional ==

Some information can be added to improve the quality of the experience or other such information:

<pre>
<merge key="sync.icon"                type="string">thingy.png</merge>
<merge key="sync.password.required"   type="boolean">1</merge>
</pre>

== Callouts ==

Any of the above information can be gathered by a script, just in case the device itself needs to be queried about what it is.
<pre>
<append key="info.callouts.add" type="strlist">hal-thingy-callout</append>
</pre>

== Works in Progress ==
