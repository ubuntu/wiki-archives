=== 7.10 Gusty Issues ===
===== When booting the familiar orange progress bar won't display =====
* change resolution in usplash (1024x768 is known to work)<pre>
sudo gedit /etc/usplash.conf
</pre>
* Add vga=791 to the kernel line in file menu.lst <pre>
sudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst
</pre>
* Update changes using <pre>
sudo update-initramfs -u -k `uname -r`
</pre>
=== Current Issues ===
===== Boot and installation =====
* To boot the installation or Live CD, I had to add ''noapic'' to the kernel parameters.
* <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+bug/35019|#35019]]</nowiki> To make the monitor display anything but the blank screen after install i had to add this line in ''Section "Device"'':
<pre>
Section "Device"
      Option "MonitorLayout" "LVDS,Auto"</pre>
  in the '''xorg.conf''' file, so for a user that installs Ubuntu for the first time without knowing this will say ''"Ubuntu is not working"''.
===== Touchpad issues  (in breezy worked great) =====
** It is not possible to do double click without using touchpad buttons.
** It is not possible to do drag'n'drop without using touchpad buttons.
** Touchpad scroll up/down left/right does not work.
===== Wireless =====
* To make wireless front led work I just open/created(if does not exist) this file:
 <pre>
~$ sudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/ipw2200
</pre>
 and add this line:
<pre>
options ipw2200 led=1
</pre>
 and after restart the led worked just fine.
* I would like to know if there are some simple steps so make wireless with WEP work out of the box or without the need of installing new packages from the internet. (wireless is useless if you can't connect to your router...)

==== Notes ====
I would like to help this team making Ubuntu 100% compatibile with this laptop, so if you find this review useful or need further tests contact me.
* The key's that doesen't work on this laptop are reported here: <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+bug/34656|#34656]]</nowiki>
* (*) The Sleep mode apparently works, the problem is that the laptop doesen't wake up, at least i have a blank screen while the HDD and CPU fan works...
* When installing Ubuntu, i press F3 and select Portuguese Layout and works, then F6 and add ''noapic'', after that the install skips keyboard selecting and I end up with English Layout during the install. If I don't select Portuguese Layout at begining (without pressing F3) and I use only ''noapic'' during the install I am asked to select my keyboard layout during install and everything woks fine.
* Now i'm wondering if anyone will ever read this and find it useful to correct all those things...
