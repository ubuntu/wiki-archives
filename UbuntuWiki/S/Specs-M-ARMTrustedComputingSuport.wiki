== Summary ==

This will provide a secure boot and a trusted execution environment to enable a secure and trustworthy use of the platform for all the stakeholders. The stakeholder will be able to verify security properties locally and remotely in order to establish and maintain trust between each other based on the health and configuration of the software stack. A challenge will be to keep the process dynamic rather than being setup at deployments.

== Rationale ==

Security mechanism in software have been proven to be by-passable therefore a hardware root of trust is required to guarantee that the trusted computing base (TCB: responsible for security management on the platform) is integral and not replace or compromised.

ARM provides with the trustzone technology, which provides a root of trust for storage (a crypto key on chip) apart from a trusted execution environment to establish a root of trust. Open Mobile Terminal Platform specifies this in "OMTP Trusted Environment: OMTP TR0" and "OMTP Advanced Trusted Environment: OMTP TR1"
