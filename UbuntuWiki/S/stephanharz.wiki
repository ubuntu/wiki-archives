=== About ===
I was homeschooled since 5th grade and worked a wide range of jobs from working as a Pipe fitter at two power plants one being a gas fired and at company peak nuclear power plant, have worked as a Level 3 guard as well as a part time computer programmer/webmaster. I have done many things as the world is full of awesome things to learn about and I enjoy on taking up new things in life.

=== Why using Ubuntu? ===
I love the Ubuntu Community as well the way Ubuntu works and the looks.
 
=== Why a challenge? ===
Why not take a challenge? I will take on any challenge just so I can learn something new.
=== Life Goals ===
By the time I am 80-years old (if I get there) when I am sitting there I wont hear the words "I never did do that"...I would like to do a little bit of everything..learning everything.
