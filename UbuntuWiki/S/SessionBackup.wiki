=== About ===
Session backup is a small application which allows users to backups their application settings (like Gnome). After a new installation, or when the user switches to another workstation, he can easily restore all his settings. Session backup has two modes, graphical mode, and command line mode. Command line can be very convenient when you do not have an X server installed, or when you would like to schedule a backup.

Session backup is implemented in Python and PyGTK. It uses the Python bindings for GConf.

This application is developed by Peter Moberg and was part of Google Summer of Code 2006. Mentors at Ubuntu where Sebastien Bacher and Vincent Untz.
