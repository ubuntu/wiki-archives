My main contribution in Ubuntu is translating,testing releases, reporting and triaging bugs and helping users in "Answers".
I usually focus on translations/review of Ubuntu packages as well as Ubuntu/Xubuntu documentation and Package Descriptions.I also mantain several upstream packages coming from the Translation Project and GNOME.

I'm an administrator of the Italian Testing Team that helps Ubuntu QA Team testing ISO images of the development release, I personally test ISO milestone and Desktop Applications for Ubuntu/Xubuntu Desktop and Netbook Edition.
I set up (officially started with Lucid Alpha 3) the "testcase and milestone based" <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/Laptop|Laptop Testing project]]</nowiki> within both the Italian Testing Team and the Ubuntu QA Team. From Natty Beta 1 reports are made using the <nowiki>[[http://laptop.qa.ubuntu.com|Laptop Tracker]]</nowiki>.
Some blueprints about this testing stuff has been discussed at UDS-M and UDS-N.

The last blueprint (which I proposed for UDS-N) have led me to work on the implementation of the Laptop Testing in the QA Tracker, that has officially started from Natty Beta 1 as already reported before.

My work on bugs, as ubuntu-bugcontrol member, is primarly focalized on Desktop, Kernel and translations issue, I help reporting/triaging bugs, find duplicates (among other things, I helped kernel team triaging/closing out EOL release kernel bugs, all the Edgy and Gusty ones, some Feisty one).
I also provided some patches <nowiki>[[https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/human-icon-theme/+bug/172353|bug #172353]]</nowiki> (human-icon-theme),<nowiki>[[https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/gnome-icon-theme/+bug/172353|bug #172353]]</nowiki> (gnome-icon-theme), <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/334345|bug #334345]]</nowiki>,<nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/517012|bug #517012]]</nowiki>,<nowiki>[[https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mobile-broadband-provider-info/+bug/632300|bug #623300]]</nowiki> (mobile broadband info) and <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/system-config-printer/+bug/394071|394071]]</nowiki> (system-config-printer).

I give help to Answer Tracker (<nowiki>[[https://answers.edge.launchpad.net/~primes2h/|here]]</nowiki> ) and I usually make submissions to the <nowiki>[[https://edge.launchpad.net/~primes2h/+hwdb-submissions|Hardware Database]]</nowiki> concerning installations I made (to friends or other people).

I also collaborate on the Ubuntu CD project in the Ubuntu Italian Marketing Team, providing copies of Ubuntu CDs and stickers for Italian people that don't have a broadband Internet connection. (<nowiki>[[http://wiki.ubuntu-it.org/GruppoPromozione/ProgettoCDUbuntu|wiki]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[https://blueprints.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu-it/+spec/cd-ubuntu|blueprint]]</nowiki>)
