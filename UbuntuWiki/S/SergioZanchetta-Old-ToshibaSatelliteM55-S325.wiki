=== Current Issues ===
First time Live CD was booted up it didn't load completely, but after reboot everything is working. So far everything is running alright.
 
Fn+F5 to switch display outputs screwed up the display, probably since nothing is connected. can't fix the display but was able to shut down properly by groping around.
