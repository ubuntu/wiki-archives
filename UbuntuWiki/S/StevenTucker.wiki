__TOC__

I am a 28 year old Newspaper Printer from the Gold Coast Australia.
Been using Linux since early '93, funny thing is that unlike most people, I started with Linux, still to this day, other OSes like Mac and windows feel foreign to me. (well actually I used windows for about 3 months before I discovered redhat 9, but not long enough to become familiar, at that stage I was still learing things like what an icon is).

Tried many distro's but Ubuntu really does it for me. Still occassionally try other distros for fun, but always come back to Ubuntu - installing gentoo on another box just for the hell of it, but would not choose it over Ubuntu.

I have run 2 installfests, started a LUG, and host the LUGS forum, blog and homepage.

love life, love freedom and love Ubuntu
