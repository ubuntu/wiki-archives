__TOC__

I'm a free software developer and consultant currently living in Santa Monica, CA, USA, and a grateful GNU/linux/debian/ubuntu user. See http://joyful.com and ZWiki:SimonMichael .

I did some support of Ubuntu's Plone and Zwiki installations in the past. Good places to get my attention are: the irc://irc.freenode.net/#zwiki channel or ZWiki:GeneralDiscussion .
