=== Current Issues ===
''Gutsy update: I've upgraded my Feisty Fawn to Gutsy Gibbon. The results here are not from a new install''

The sound works but stops when volume in alsamixer is adjusted. A way to fix this is to add the following options when loading the snd-hda-intel module:
'''options snd-hda-intel position_fix=1 model=3stack'''

Fn+F6 (decrease brightness key) does not return any ATKD value.
