I have been using Ubuntu since late 2006 on an older laptop and dual booting on a desktop.  I've actually tried out linux on several occasions in the past, but haven't started to really make the big leap until now.  Due to my commitments with the military I can't fully convert all of my systems yet (have to use Windows and IE to access my secure websites) but once I hit retirement, Microsoft will become an ugly painful memory!

I guess I am here to really take the plunge into the world of Ubuntu and see what I can do in my small way to help out.  I haven't programmed in years, but documentation is one of my big suits as well as testing.
