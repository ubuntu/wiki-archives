Hi, My name is Sisir Koppaka, Ubuntite and Linux user. I am 17 years old right now and was a SCSA for Solaris 8 at 12 years and SCNA for Solaris 8 by 14. I'm interested in kernel programming, interface design and absolutely 'hate' bugs, though I suppose I will begin to like them with some more experience. Currently, I'm preparing for the JEE and will probably begin coding open-source style sometime next year.
