==== Notes ====

* 1 - I would advise to use the Alternate Install CD instead of the Desktop Install since the Live CD seems to go extremely slow on here.

* 2 - Install 915resolution using your favourite package tool/manager. For instance: apt-get install 915resolution. Then logout of your user, do CTRL+ALT+BACKSPACE to restart the X Server. Then you should have the correct resolution.

* 3 - I heard theres a way to get this working, but need to Google more some ;).
