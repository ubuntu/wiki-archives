=== Introduction ===
On October 18th the Ubuntu community released Gutsy Gibbon (Ubuntu 7.10) and it's now time to celebrate it in Switzerland. The Swiss local community is happy to invite you to the release party which will take place at  the Puzzle office in Bern on November 10th from 2pm to midnight (Puzzle ITC GmbH, Eigerplatz 4, 3007 Bern).

=== Gutsy Gibbon what's new ===
It would be impossible to talk about all improvements of Ubuntu here, so we will only have a quick tour to give a general idea of what you will find in Gutsy.

The most apparent change in Ubuntu 7.10 is the general look and feel. Ubuntu now integrates Compiz Fusion  which offers 3D desktop experience. Gutsy  Gibbon  automatically detects whether the hardware is capable of running Compiz Fusion; if not, it falls back to normal desktop. All  Compiz Fusion Visual Effects can be graphically managed from "System/Preferences/Appearance".

But Ubuntu 7.10 is not only about eye candy it will also improve your productivity by preventing you from loosing time searching for files. Ubuntu now includes the Deskbar applet out off the box. This applet let's you search files, open web bookmarks and search, launch applications and many more. In addition the Tracker indexer has been added to the desktop which will considerably tune your file search.

Ubuntu 7.10 includes lot more new features and improvements such as Firefox plug in install support. Which means you can now install your favorite Firefox plug in as you would install any other official Ubuntu package.
