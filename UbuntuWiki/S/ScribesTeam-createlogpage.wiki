=== Creating Meeting Logs is easy ===
# Save the log of the meeting from within the IRC client. 
# Visit MeetingLogs. Select the meeting team that was just saved. (eg Community Council) 
# On the team subpage, change the url by adding the meeting's date to the end. Press enter. (eg. <nowiki>[[MeetingLogs/CC-2006-9-5]]</nowiki>) 
# A page stating 'no page exists' should appear. Select 'create new page'. If it does not double check.
# Open the log in the text editor. Copy only the meeting portion to the clipboard.
# In the first text box on the webpage type three open braces (eg { { { ). Paste in the log. Type three close brace (eg } } }). Click save changes button.
# Open the listing page for the team meeting just created. Select edit near the top of the page.
# A page similar to the empty one earlier except containing text of the page being edited will appear. Find the listing of meeting dates in the text. Before them make a new line containing the meeting log page created. Follow the formating. Click save changes button.
