=== Driver problems ===
* Wlan adapter: rt2500 won't work with network-manager (Bug #37120). In edgy, it doesn't see any network, you have to enter the essid by hand. What's more, from time to time, it disconnects and randomly won't reconnect (both bug #64334).
* Video card (via k8m800): Direct rendering is enabled but most 3d-programs either crash or won't even start. Screensavers crash the system (Bug #43154).
