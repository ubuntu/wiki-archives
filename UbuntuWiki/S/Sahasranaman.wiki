=== About me ===
I am an engineering student, doing my final year in Instrumentation engineering, at a college affiliated under Anna University, Chennai, India. 
I have always been a big fan of free software, but I haven't been able to get started with Ubuntu until recently. I would like to work on projects based on virtual instrumentation and process control software. I am not in any of the launchpad groups or projects right now, but would like to join very soon. I have been helping a few people find solutions to their problems in launchpad.

Launchpad ID: javaboy-ms

Email: I blog at http://sahasranaman.com
