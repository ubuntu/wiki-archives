=== Current Issues ===
Gutsy: The laptop will suspend to RAM but will not wake up at all. Hibernation fails completely dropping to a blank screen with flashing cursor. Installing (and switching to) KDE desktop will render the wireless networking inoperable after a few reboots with NetworkManager insisting there are no access points in range despite being only two feet away. Only reinstalling will bring wireless back as switching back to Gnome finds the same situation.   

Gutsy: There is also an issue with the keyboard inserting the same random key even if nothing is pressed. See http://www.linuxforums.org/forum/peripherals-hardware/112874-distro-without-symantics-mouse-problem.html
for more on this.

==== Notes ====
 1. Restricted drivers: Unless you already have the drivers and firmware be sure to have a working (wired) Internet connection before attempting to install! For some reason the system will demand they be selected from the local file system even if you add a working connection later on.
 2. Startup: While power on to Grub is typical, from there to login screen can take almost five minutes.
