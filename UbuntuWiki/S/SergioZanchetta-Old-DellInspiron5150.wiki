__TOC__

* Contact: JoelKonkleParker, JonathanJesse, GregTaylor, AnkurKotwal, Alperthereal, <nowiki>[[Nanotube]]</nowiki>
* Make: Dell
* Model: Inspiron 5150

=== Current Issues ===

* Fn + Esc (the Suspend hotkey) does not work, even though the Suspend feature itself works (when activated from the menu, e.g.) [This is on Breezy, and on Dapper] ~~<nowiki>[[Nanotube]]</nowiki>
* Fn + F10 (Eject CD drive tray hotkey) does not work, with or without a CD in the drive. [This is on Breezy] Note: it works on Dapper ~~<nowiki>[[Nanotube]]</nowiki>
* In the default install, Suspend/Sleep support is disabled in /etc/default/acpi-support. First line needs to be uncommented to enable. Is there any reason for this? [This is on Breezy] [This is also the case after Dapper upgrade] ~~<nowiki>[[Nanotube]]</nowiki>
* 5 button USB mouse is not properly detected as 5-button. Have to manually edit xorg.conf to enable extra buttons. [This is on Breezy] [Also the case on Dapper] ~~<nowiki>[[Nanotube]]</nowiki>

==== Notes ====

* PCMCIA Works ( tested with a pcmcia wireless network card D-Link AirPlus DWL-G650 )
* Fn + Page Up/Dn and Fn + End work provided that they are configured in System>Preferences>Keyboard Shortcuts. (Note this also works in Flight 2) [Another note - these work on my Breezy install by default, and also work after upgrade to Dapper, without having to fiddle with Keyboard Shortcuts ~~<nowiki>[[Nanotube]]</nowiki>]
* While Fn + Esc (Suspend) does not work, the Suspend feature itself does work. You can set something like Ctrl + Esc to act as the Suspend key, by configuring in System>Preferences>Keyboard Shortcuts (look for the Sleep function) Note: on Dapper, the Sleep function is no longer present in Keyboard Shortcuts panel. ~~<nowiki>[[Nanotube]]</nowiki>
* To get the bcm43xx wireless NIC driver to work, you must manually install b43-fwcutter in addition to the device driver. More details on the <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx|WifiDocs page]]</nowiki>.  ~~<nowiki>[[amnuxoll]]</nowiki>
