=== Summary ===

We currently have limited tools to help manage and maintain RedBoot in Ubuntu, which is a common bootloader on ARM devices.

=== Release Note ===

Ubuntu now includes tools for managing RedBoot on the ARM architecture.

=== Rationale ===

Being able to update Redboot to add significant new functionality, or to correct serious bugs is desirable.

=== Design ===
* Creation and inclusion of utilites to do the following:
** Inclusion of a script to install Redboot to flash or equivelent
** Addition to the fconfig command to initialize Redboot's FIS tables
** These scripts need to be integrated into debian-cd so arch specific hacks can be dropped
** In addition, usb-creator should use these scripts to convert from ISO to IMG assuming ISO is desirable for armel

=== Test/Demo Plan ===

=== Unresolved issues ===

=== BOF Notes ===

Redboot Scripting

* Currently have scripts that change and edit config
* http://people.ubuntu.com/~ogra/arm/babbage/redboot-install has a prototype for
  a redboot installer script
* Script to flash redboot in package flash-kernel
* During installation ubiquity and debian-installer set up /etc/kernel-img.conf to call the flash-kernel script as a postinst hook

* Redboot Linux tools (allow manipulation of Redboot from Linux), currently in the redboot-tools package in the ubuntu archive
* fconfig
** No init command to initialize redboot
* fis
* Need to patch the fconfig script to do what is needed
* A redbooot-install script similar to the above prototype script will be added to the redboot-tools package
** the script needs to create a raw wrapper partition to protect the space from being overwritten unintentional by partitioning tools
** the redboot-tools scripts need to be used to create the cd images in debian-cd, so arch specific hacks in debian-cd can be dropped
** usb-creator should use the redboot-tools to convert from iso format (if it is actually desired to have .iso images for armel devices)

=== ACTION ===
* ogra to finish redboot-install (make it also usable from x86 so users can create bootable devices in a cross platform way
* dyfet to take a look at the missing bits to get an "fconfig init" command that sets up an initial redboot configuration without needing a binary blob
* in case it is decided to use iso images for armel, ogra will discuss the needed changes to usb-creator with evand
