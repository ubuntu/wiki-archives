Ubuntu Core Dev, member of the Ubuntu Foundations Team at Canonical. Not to be confused with <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~tsimonq|the other Simon]]</nowiki> of Lubuntu fame. You can usually find me roaming the various Ubuntu virtual places during European business hours.

People usually ping me about things regarding glibc or rustc.

===== Incomplete history of work in Ubuntu =====

I have worked full-time on Ubuntu since July 2021, when I joined Canonical. Since then, I became MOTU in October 2021, which I leveraged to drive the libssl3 transition. I leveled up to Core Dev in May 2022, which is about the same time I started becoming involved in glibc. You'll find traces of my work also in the Rust toolchain, Apport development, and even in the Netplan sources.

In a slightly more community-oriented area, I'm involved with the <nowiki>[[https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/ubuntu-patch-pilots/37705|Patch Pilot program]]</nowiki>, and am usually available on IRC or Matrix.
