==== Notes ====

[1] Website is German only. In order to download user manuals (German, Italian and French language) as well as (Windows) drivers go to http://www1.medion.de/downloads/ type 97300 in the field next to "MD/LT Nummer" and press Enter or click on "Suche" (German for Search).

[2] Fn+F1 should enable/disable the WLAN card and there's a led to show the current status. This led turns on/off but the card in not supported at the moment. 

[3] The microphone is a bit week, make sure that you enable the boost via Volume control.

[4] Hibernate works well on 6.10 but on 7.04 after resuming none of the USB ports work. iPod is not being mounted, cursor does no react to mouse movements. Unplugging and the replugging the USB devices has no effect.

Sleep works in 6.10 as long as none of the USB devices attached at the time when the systems suspends are removed. It is no longer working in 7.04.
