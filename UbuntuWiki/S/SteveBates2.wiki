Email: 
Need to dialup using one of those SecurID one-shot password generators (eg, to your employers' network)?

You can't do it using the Ubuntu network tool, as it expects a fixed password.

WVDIAL http://open.nit.ca/wiki/?WvDial is the answer that worked for me.

Essentially, setup wvdial to get its password as a command line argument, open a terminal as root, and enter

'''wvdial password=nnnnnn'''

where the nnnnnn is the number on the SecurID (might be ppppnnnnnn if your remote system insists on a fixed PIN prefix as well).

Works fine for me. Details are at my website http://tardus.co.nr under the "computers" section
