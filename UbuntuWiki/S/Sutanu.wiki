Hello All,

I am a Software Engineer from India. I started developing softwares when I was only 13. Earlier I used to write programs using Hardcore Assembly with No OS :o

Later when I started using Linux, I fell in love with it. Now I am a system side developer but in my free time I develop softwares for KDE (Qt guys may feel happy), as well as console (hardcore command line stuff :P )

Now am starting my work for Kubuntu. Please visit my page for update. Also Visit http://sutanu.net for daily update.
