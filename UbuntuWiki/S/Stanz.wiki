=== Things I've done...like to do or want to do... ===

* I participated a few years back, on a Canonical project, testing *buntu on Laptops. I thought - why not!<<BR>>
Joining the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LaptopTestingTeam/Old|LaptopTestingTeam]]</nowiki> I did what I could, posting my test results for my GatewayM285E.<<BR>>
So now, again with a Laptop--testing my new <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/Laptop/Reports/DellInspiron1546|Dell Inspiron 1546]]</nowiki>, in the new <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/Laptop|Laptop Testing Project]]</nowiki> is a work in progress as of Jan/11.<<BR>>
    I find an interest in the ubuntu-qa team and what I might do there. Testing sounds fun!
