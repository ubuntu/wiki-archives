=== Who am I? ===
I worked on the Product Strategy team at Canonical Ltd. on the Compiz window manager and Unity Desktop Shell. However, I am more known for my maintenance of the former. Over the past year, I have been re-targeting Compiz for usage in Ubuntu and in Unity in order to provide a cohesive, beautiful and accessible desktop experience.

=== What have I done for Ubuntu so far? ===
* Maintained compiz over the past 5 years with Ubuntu as the primary target over the past two
* Contributed to the Unity Shell, in patches and infrastructure
* Participated in the Ubuntu forums (handle "SmSpillaz")

=== What will I do for Ubuntu in the future? ===
I'll be working on <nowiki>[[SkunkWorks-SamSpilsbury|skunkworks projects]]</nowiki>
