'''I, Shih-Yuan Lee, apply for <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DeveloperMembershipBoard/KnowledgeBase#Canonical_OEM_metapackage_packageset|Canonical OEM metapackage packageset]]</nowiki>.'''

I am applying because:

* I participated the design the Canonical OEM metapackage.
* I made the Canonical OEM metapackage CI to automate the tests.

== Who I am ==
I am a Debian developer since <nowiki>[[https://nm.debian.org/person/fourdollars|2017-05-07]]</nowiki>. I maintained <nowiki>[[https://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=fourdollars+fourdollars%40gmail.com&comaint=yes|some Debian packages]]</nowiki>. I was an official GNOME Foundation Member from 2017-06-05 to 2019-06-04.
I am a Canonical employee for more than 10 years. I works in OEM Enablement team of Devices Enablement department.

== My Ubuntu story ==
As a Ubuntu community member, I created and maintained <nowiki>[[https://www.facebook.com/groups/ubuntu.zh.hant/|Ubuntu Traditional Chinese Group]]</nowiki> on Facebook and supported <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu-tw.org/|Ubuntu Taiwan Community]]</nowiki> for many years. As a Canonical employee, I physically joined UDS-{<nowiki>[[http://summit.ubuntu.com/uds-m/|M]]</nowiki>,<nowiki>[[http://summit.ubuntu.com/uds-n/|N]]</nowiki>,<nowiki>[[http://summit.ubuntu.com/uds-o/|O]]</nowiki>,<nowiki>[[http://summit.ubuntu.com/uds-p/|P]]</nowiki>}. I preloaded the customized Ubuntu systems in many kinds of x86 PCs for ASUS, Dell, ECS, HP and Lenovo. During the development of Ubuntu preloaded images, I will handle all kind of issues from the hardware, firmware and UEFI BIOS to the GRUB bootloader, Linux kernel, Ubiquity installer, Dell/Ubuntu Reocvery, X Window System, GNOME and the GUI applications on Ubuntu.

=== My involvement ===
=== Examples of my work / Things I'm proud of ===

* I made a legacy traditional Chinese input method <nowiki>[[http://fourdollars.github.io/ibus-zhuyin/|ibus-zhuyin]]</nowiki> from scratch. I also maintain it in <nowiki>[[https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/ibus-zhuyin|Debian Package Tracker - ibus-zhuyin]]</nowiki> so you can install it in Debian/Ubuntu.

* I made a pure X11 application <nowiki>[[http://fourdollars.github.io/x11-touchscreen-calibrator/|x11-touchscreen-calibrator]]</nowiki> from scratch to calibrate the touchscreen automatically. I also maintain it in <nowiki>[[https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/x11-touchscreen-calibrator|Debian Package Tracker - x11-touchscreen-calibrator]]</nowiki> so you can install it in Debian/Ubuntu.

* I made https://bit.ly/mainline_kernels to quickly install the kernels from https://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline, seeing the usage on https://github.com/fourdollars/scripts. 

* I made https://github.com/fourdollars/energy-tools to measure for some energy saving standards as easy as possible and there is a PPA at <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~fourdollars/+archive/ubuntu/energy-tools|ppa:fourdollars/energy-tools]]</nowiki> and a snap package on https://snapcraft.io/energy-tools.

* I made https://code.launchpad.net/~fourdollars/+git/meta-ci and https://github.com/fourdollars/webhook-relay to run autopkgtest automatically when people commit changes into https://code.launchpad.net/~oem-solutions-engineers/pc-enablement/+git/oem-{somerville,stella,sutton}-projects-meta by the <nowiki>[[https://help.launchpad.net/API/Webhooks|Launchpad webhooks]]</nowiki> on Git repositories.

=== Areas of work ===

My daily work in Canonical is majorly for Ubuntu preloaded images, so I work on the installer, related components and the image build system, such as debian-installer, ubiquity, live-build and dell-recovery. Except Ubuntu preloaded images, I also work for many kinds of issues reported by Canonical OEM QA and the OEM/ODM, such as Linux kernel, X Window system, Freedesktop components, GNOME components, EDID, UEFI, BIOS/EC, WiFi/Bluetooth devices, WWAN devices, touchpad devices, touchscreen devices, hotkeys, USB docking stations, and Energy Star and Eup/Erp Lot.

Recently I maintained the infrastructure of OEM metapackages in Ubuntu preloaded images and I need to work out some problem in Ubiquity, so I asked for the help from the Desktop team (laney) and the Foundations team (juliank).

=== Things I could do better ===

I hope I can learn more knowledge about the package uploading process and convention in Ubuntu, and then I would like to apply to become an Ubuntu core developer in the future.

== Plans for the future ==
=== General ===
=== What I like least in Ubuntu ===
I would like to make some CI/CD pipelines/jobs to automate the OEM metapackages in Ubuntu archives.

==== General feedback ====

I worked with FourDollars on designing the OEM metapackage scheme. It was a smooth experience, we worked through any problems together and they were responsive to any questions/concerns that I raised. FourDollars also mentors other members of the team into operating the process. As they mentioned, they were responsible for writing a lot of the automation that goes into generating the packages. For both these reason - providing extensive mentoring and handling a lot of the work via tooling - FourDollars as a name doesn't appear as an uploader for a lot of the oem-*-meta we have in the archive. But that's also a reason why they should have the rights to sponsor for their teammates.

I'm not sure if there's anyone on the OEM team side who knows the design better.

This process (the packageset that FourDollars is applying to) has been designed with the aim of eventually handing over from a core-dev (often me) to a member of the OEM team. In my opinion FourDollars is a fine candidate and is ready right now.
