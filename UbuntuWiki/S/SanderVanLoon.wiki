__TOC__

Hi, I am Alexander (also Sander) van Loon, a 20 years old student of Public Administration in the Netherlands. My website is http://www.svanloon.nl/ which is in Dutch. I've been a Linux fan for 5 years or so since I first touched SUSE Linux 8.0. I didn't like that distro so I tried many others, until I settled on Ubuntu and Kubuntu, which are the best distro's IMHO. My involvement is mainly in reporting bugs to Launchpad and GNOME/KDE Bugzilla.
