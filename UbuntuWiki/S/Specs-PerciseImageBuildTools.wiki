=== Summary ===

Parts of the image build infrastructure are in a private branch due to historical reasons. This spec covers opening up the missing code, and providing documentation on how to build Ubuntu images with the build system code.

=== Release Note ===

The ubuntu build system scripts have been updated and documented to allow end-users to remaster Ubuntu images in a way consistent with official image builds.

=== Rationale ===

As part of the move to enable more consumer devices, a major effort is being made to make it possible to allow a non-Canonical developer be able to do image enablement work end to end, including building images in an official manner; the only difference between an official image and an unofficial image is the GPG key, and the OFFICIAL flag being set to off by default.

=== User stories ===

* Alpha is an OEM and wants to do custom images that will be released to end-users with a modified load and wishes to be as consistent as possible with Ubuntu's current practices.

* Beta is doing platform enablement, and wishes to implement images for a new SoC which requires modified boot scripts

=== Assumptions ===
* That the necessary code, once dehardcoded and scrubbed to remove any private references is approved for release by management

=== Design ===

You can have subsections that better describe specific parts of the issue.

=== Implementation ===

==== Code Changes ====

* buildlive - buildd names need to be dehardcoded
* All scripts moving private->public must be screened to make sure they have no references to NDA'ed projects

==== Migration ====

* N/A

=== Test/Demo Plan ===

Have a end-user without access to antimony use the newly available code and build local images which are also install-able, and document their experience

=== Unresolved issues ===

This should highlight any issues that should be addressed in further specifications, and not problems with the specification itself; since any specification with problems cannot be approved.

=== BoF agenda and discussion ===
