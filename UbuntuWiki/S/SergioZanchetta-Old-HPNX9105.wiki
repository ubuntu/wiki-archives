==== Notes ====
* the ''(not default)'' mention means that it can work by configuring the system.
* wireless chip: the broadcom firmware is to be extracted from the file BCMWL5.SYS (OEM) with the bcm43xx-fwcutter utility available in the ''bcm43xx-fwcutter'' package from the ''universe'' repository.
* internal modem: the ''sl-modem-daemon'' package from the ''multiverse'' repository is needed for the internal modem (using standard ALSA low level drivers). The modem works though the mini-speaker does not chirp (even with an "ATML2" hayes command).
* You will need at least 320MB RAM for Gutsy, otherwise it won't install nor run. Gutsy tested with HP nx9105 rev. DU428EA#AKR, upgraded by 1GB Kingstom RAM module.
