== About Me ==
My name is ScottKrazek.  I am 25 years old and work on Optical networks. I'm from San Francisco, and currently work in SLC Utah.

=== My interest in Ubuntu ===
I started using Linux in 2003 for Computer Science classes. I got involved in the campus LUG, http://uug.byu.edu/, and continued involvment while my interests in hardware led me into more of an engineering path than pure software. I tried a few distributions before going with Ubuntu in 2005 as the rest of the LUG has drifted this direction.

=== LUG Installfests ===
I've been active in LUG installfests the 2004 when I went to load FC 1 on a pile of spare computer parts through the last couple of years where Ubuntu has come to the forefront as a user focused distribution.

=== Wiki Contributions ===
I'm now looking into greater community involvement beyond the university.
