__TOC__

* Contact: [PatrickKolla]
* Make: HP
* Brand: Pavilion
* Model: zd8000
* Website: <nowiki>[[http://www.shopping.hp.com/webapp/shopping/computer_series.do?series_name=zd8000_series&catLevel=2&category=notebooks/hp_pavilion&storeName=computer_store|shopping.hp.com]]</nowiki>

=== Current Issues ===
==== Gutsy ====
* Compiz in conjunction with 8.42.3 ATI drivers causes the system to hang on Hibernate/Suspend. <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.22/+bug/121653|Bug #121653]]</nowiki>

==== Breezy ====
* /etc/acpi/sleep.sh doesn't do anything, without any output.
* Wireless NIC key now toggles light correctly and disables and enables wireless, but at least with WPA, I need to manually get the device up again (ifconfig wlan0 up, wpa_supplicant, dhclient).
* Gnome panel now tells me "CPU frequency scaling unsupported" but shows proper frequency at least.
* Bluetooth does not work.
* Touchpad double-tap does not work correctly in 64bit Ubuntu, if mouse is configured for left-handed people. It is possible that this may be a package bug within Xorg and/or Gnome. More testing will need to be done to confirm (i.e.: Try same operation in KDE.)

==== Hoary ====
* CPU scaling doesn't show in Gnome panel, and monitoring battery decrease, probably doesn't work at all (partly fixed in Breezy).
* If ''Touchpad - Scroll down side'' means the scrollwheel part, it doesn't work - it simply moves the mouse pointer (fixed in Breezy).
* Sony USB stick with integrated fingerprint scanner cannot be opened due to Ubuntu not able to determine file system (even though a 64 MB FAT part of it is accessible without fingerprint, and works on Win & MacOS) (untested in Breezy).
* When connecting the power supply when machine is already running, new status (no longer "Running on Battery") isn't recognized.
* Choosing Hibernate from the logoff options kills the wireless connection and has a short impact on the CPU (100% for a few seconds), and Gnome still reacts, but any further logoff/shutdown attempt (even from command line) just hangs (untested in Breezy).
* Wireless NIC key does not disable wireless interface (nor turn off the wireless LED) (partly fixed in Breezy).
* /etc/acpi/sleep.sh doesn't do anything, without any output.

==== Notes ====
* Integrated Wireless NIC works with ndiswrapper (bcmwl5.inf/bcmwl5.sys) & wpa_supplicant only
* Successfully tested Data CD, Audio CD, Data DVD, Video DVD (sound missing, will test further).
* Testing of serial mouse does not apply since notebook does have neither serial nor PS/2 port.
* For working graphics, I had to ''sudo apt-get install xorg-driver-fglrx'', and change the ''/etc/X11/xorg.conf'' to show (first line for graphics at all, second and third for correct wide screen resolution)
** * Driver "fglrx" 
** * Option "VideoOverlay" "on" 
** * Option "UserInternalAGPART" "no"
** More ATi Information:
** For fglrx installation/configuration, a General HOWTO has been posted at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=75378
*** For Widescreen configurations, another HOWTO can be found here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=423589
*** This is the HOWTO I followed to get the X600 256MB chipset in my zd8000 working with 3D acceleration enabled.  However, to achieve the optimal 1680x1050 resolution, I had to manually add "1680x1050" to the "Screen" section of my xorg.conf:
**** # Any number of screen sections may be present.  Each describes
**** # the configuration of a single screen.  A single specific screen section
**** # may be specified from the X server command line with the "-screen"
**** # option.
**** Section "Screen"
**** Identifier  "Screen0"
**** Device      "ATI Graphics Adapter"
**** Monitor     "Monitor0"
**** DefaultDepth 24
**** #Option "backingstore"

**** Subsection "Display"
**** Depth       24
**** Modes       "1680x1050" "1400x1050" "1280x1024" "1024x768"
**** ViewPort    0 0  # initial origin if mode is smaller than desktop
**** #       Virtual     1280 1024
**** EndSubsection
**** EndSection
*** Specified custom Horizontal and Vertical rates for monitor while stepping through "fglrxconfig".  I obtained the Horizontal and Vertical Refresh Rates from HP Customer Support:
**** H: 30-64
**** V: 50-100
**** NOTE: These are specifically for the '17.0" WSXGA+ BrightView Wide Viewing (1680x1050)' display that is in my particular laptop.  Your display specs may vary, so contact HP Customer Support for your exact settings.  (I am not responsible for any damage done to your display.)  Be sure to have your laptop serial number handy.  They will need that to give you the correct information.
* Bluetooth did not find nearby (2 feet) iMac with Bluetooth enabled and visible. Testing will continue with cellphone.
* Touchpad double-tap works fine in 32bit (x86) Ubuntu in both right and left hand configurations, but not 64bit.
