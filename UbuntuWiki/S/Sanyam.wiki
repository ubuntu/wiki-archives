Hi,

                                           I am Sanyam

I am using linux for last one year however i am new to ubuntu linux.

Three things about me which is difficult to guess by looking at me.

1. Although it took 22 years for my conciouus to realize that i may be(this Wacky mind ask questions) good at Computers , its better late than NEVER.

2. My ultimate aim is to engage my mind to LEARN something new at every possible second of my being.

3. I am usually stupid.
