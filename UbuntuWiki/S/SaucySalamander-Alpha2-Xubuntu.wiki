== Getting Xubuntu 13.10 Alpha 2 ==

=== Download a Disk Image ===
* <nowiki>[[http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/xubuntu/releases/saucy/alpha-2/|Bootable images for standard PCs/laptops/netbooks]]</nowiki>

Instructions for burning the image to a DVD or USB flash drive can be found on the <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BurningIsoHowto|Burning ISO Howto]]</nowiki>.

We recommend you learn how to <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HowToMD5SUM|check your image file]]</nowiki> so your pre-release is as it’s supposed to be.

== Alpha 2 Highlights ==

=== Software Updates ===

* Xubuntu is now shipping apt-offline in the default installation along with instructions on the documentation.  This tools allows for easier access to package archives in bandwidth-constrained conditions as well as when a computer lacks an always-on connection to the Internet.  Usage examples are part of the included documentation.
