* apparmor abstractions cleanup
* apparmor usability
* sort out apparmor upstream vs apparmor in ubuntu (is this still needed?)
* ufw
** usability improvements:
** delete by number
** reset
** limit command options
** show listening
** rsyslog
** more reporting
** more work on ufw/upstart/boot integration
** what does server team need/want (eg, ebtables?)
** requested features (eg ufw-simple-gui, nat/rdr, etc)
* libvirt/apparmor features, polishing and maintenance
** bug fixing
** add backing store support
** make sure it works with newer releases
** support features newly supported by the selinux driver
** continue to develop test cases (eg pool-* and vol-* commands)
** run qemu:///system VMs as non-root
* we should generalize and improve the apparmor apport hook
* update firefox profile to work better in KDE (and XFCE)
* implement a way to automatically, but temporarily, subscribe ubuntu-security to package bugs for security uploads

* Smartcard/USB token authentication
* Certificate on USB disk authentication
