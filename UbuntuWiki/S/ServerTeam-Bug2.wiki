'''Linux cannot compete with Microsoft in many corporate and educational server markets.'''

Regression: Linux servers were once highly competitive behind corporate firewalls. Microsoft servers had little market share.

<nowiki>[[https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/1|Launchpad Bug #1 ]]</nowiki> describes Microsoft's dominant desktop market share, which has helped Microsoft's server market share. Bug #1 drives Bug #2, but there is another cause of Bug #2: Microsoft's server products are better solutions for many corporate and educational markets. Linux is prevented from competing because it does not meet minimum requirements.

===== Steps to repeat on a corporate or educational network: =====

* Present a server that delivers an application. Users ask 'but does it talk natively with Active Directory?' Active Directory has already won; in a majority of networks a solution cannot be considered unless it integrates seamlessly with AD. Even though Linux can integrate with Active Directory, applications do not (May 2008) use this ability. Many do not integrate fully with LDAP either, so it isn't a Bug #1 problem. <<BR>> '''Result: Linux servers cannot compete.'''

* Present a scalable, robust, standards-compliant mail server. Users ask 'but can Outlook talk to it natively and without client modification?' Exchange and Outlook have won these markets partly on merit; the flexible groupware experience offered by Outlook is not supported by RFC-compliant Linux servers. Linux servers do not (May 2008) talk to Outlook natively. <<BR>> '''Result: Linux servers cannot compete.''' 

* Present Linux server management tools. Users are not interested because Windows servers have graphical tools that manage whole networks of machines from one console, and seamlessly integrate with Active Directory. Linux servers do not support any such tools. <<BR>> '''Result: Linux servers cannot compete.'''

* Attempt to replicate a writeable 1Tb filesystem to another server on the same network so that the second server is within a few minutes of the master, in the way that Windows can. Linux cannot replicate substantial filesystems well. <<BR>> '''Result: Linux servers cannot compete.'''

* Present a Linux server that does any or all of the above. The user will say 'but you had to spend days configuring it all, whereas with Microsoft it is just out of the box!' <<BR>> '''Result: Linux servers cannot compete.''' 

===== What should happen: =====

* The user should say 'I see Linux meets my basic compatibility criteria, has GUI tools and can replicate filesystems, all with default installation choices. Given that, now I can evaluate the claimed additional benefits Linux offers.' <<BR>> '''Result: Linux servers are competitive.'''

* The user should say 'I can choose whether new Linux server go alongside or instead of Microsoft servers. Given that, I feel comfortable trying Linux servers.' <<BR>> '''Result: Linux servers are competitive.'''

===== How to fix: =====

 1. Stop the problem getting worse: isolate Microsoft servers so all clients talk through Linux software, without changing either clients or servers.  This introduces a new level of control, and opportunities for increased performance, flexibility and predictability.

 1. Be as compatible as we can at as many levels as we can, aiming for the ability to speak 100% native Microsoft protocols for AD and Exchange.

 1. Work on integration: for example making sure the top twenty LAMP applications and the top twenty other server applications can all use common authentication and authorisation mechanisms, and that one of these mechanisms is AD.

 1. Work on parity in key areas including GUI administration and file replication.

 1. Once Linux meets the minimum requirements to compete for Server markets, play to Linux's strengths. For example, if every LDAP-enabled LAMP stack appplication is proxied to Active Directory for authentication, then we are competitive and have a chance of showcasing LAMP apps.
