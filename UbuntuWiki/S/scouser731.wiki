I have been an Ubuntu user since March 2008 and am an active member on the Ubuntu Forums, http://ubuntuforums.org/member.php?u=536148
I visit the forums daily and try to help out where I can.

I would like to see Ubuntu gaining a much larger share of the market and perhaps getting blogs, technology websites & technology programmes to feature Ubuntu more prevelant rather than staying with Microsoft or Mac.
