== Mootbot Herders Guide ==

The aim of this document is to give a overview of the relevant herding commands for Mootbot.

Herder's main role is to get the Mootbot on the required channels, and then get it to leave after the meeting is completed. Commands will be added in the future to differentiate be permanent and temporary channels (for example, the bot will auto-leave after a #endmeeting command). 

All herder commands are done via query/privmsg.

==Joining A Channel== 

<pre>
 <AndrewWilliams> joinchan #meeting-channel
 <MootBot> Joined #meeting-channel
</pre>

==Leaving A Channel== 

<pre>
 <AndrewWilliams> leavechan #meeting-channel
 <MootBot> Left #meeting-channel
</pre>
