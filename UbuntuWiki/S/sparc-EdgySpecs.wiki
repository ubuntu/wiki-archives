=== Summary ===

Dapper released with sparc server support.  This spec aims to provide direction and goals for the next release (edgy) of the sparc port.

=== Rationale ===

Being able to provide a consistent user experience across different architectures is an important goal. At the moment sparc is still not considered as mature as the x86/amd64/powerpc ports.  We want to make the sparc port as good or better than the other ports with regards to stability, quality and maturity.

=== Use cases ===

* Company foo wants to use N1 and N2 for a custom application they are creating. Ubuntu provides a well-optimized glibc which helps them reduce time needed for the computations.

* Webhosting company bar does an enormous amount of SSL transactions. They decide to use Ubuntu since it has SSL acceleration in hardware on sparc N1 and N2 CPUs.

* University baz needs to do a very special mass deployment of Ubuntu sparc, but the default OBP setting to boot from disk0 does not fit them. Ubuntu provides the ability to preseed/modify the OBP which enables them to save a lot of manpower.

* Sun wants to demonstrate Ubuntu to their customers on their brand new sparc based workstation and be able to install with Ubiquity.

=== Design and Implementation ===

* Enable all possible glibc optimizations for N1 and N2:

** Build libc6 with gcc-4.1. (done)

** Enable -mcpu=niagara for glibc sparcv9v and sparc64v flavours. (done)

* Installer:

** Set automatically OBP boot device to point to a silo instance.

 Postponed to edgy+1:

* Add ssl hw accelerator support.

* Make X autoconfig rock hard:

** X driver autodetection on sparc needs to be done almost from scratch:

** the db needs to understand/know/detect/handle sbus video cards and framebuffer only video cards.

** according to the card detection a proper resolution detection needs to be implemented and implementation varies according to the card bus type. (ex: framebuffer can use kernel sysctl to gather info)

* Create and test Live CD for sparc
** Arrange for daily livefs builds for sparc on an autobuilder machine
** If squashfs does not work properly on sparc, casper device-mapper and ext2 may be used instead
** Arrange for daily live ISO builds as part of the normal CD image build process

* Complete Ubiquity silo support.

=== Unresolved issues ===

* LDOM installation is binded to a firmware from SUN that is not publicaly available yet.

* FabioMassimoDiNitto has no usable sparc based workstation. X tasks need to be delegated.
