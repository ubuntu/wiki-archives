=== Contributions ===
Kubuntu:
I started with assisting in the dialog with KDE to move the
documentation to the KDE userbase.
I did the initial Mediawiki formatting of the documentation on the userbase.
I was taught how to package, and I have been a packaging machine ever since.
I have packaged KDE Frameworks, new releases, package requests,
and I have recently started to learn merging. 

Goals:
My plans are to learn and grow with (K)ubuntu to make it the best distribution available.

=== Future Goals ===
My plans are to continue to master packaging and learn programming for bug fixing and improvements.

Scarlet has worked tirelessly on packaging KDE Frameworks 5 and KDE Plasma 5.  I support her membership entirely.  JonathanRiddell

Scarlett is a dream to work with. She speaks up, says exactly what she intends to do, and follows through. And then does more! She is already functioning as a Kubuntu Member, and deserves the official perks that reward her hard work and cheerful enthusiasm. ValorieZimmerman
