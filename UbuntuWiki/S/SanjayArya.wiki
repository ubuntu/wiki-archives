== About Sanjay Arya ==
Hello, I am Sanjay Arya, I Love {*} , I'm Hindu, I live in Yangon(Rangoon) Myanmar(Burma).

I am currently an Android and Web Freelancer. I develop android and web app on Ubuntu. I love Open Source Application and License.

I have played around with Linux since 2011. I started using Linux with "Fedora Core 5" since 2010 when I'm learning Networking with Linux. But when I meet <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/kokoye2007|Ko Ko Ye]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ethan|Ethan]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ChitKoKoWin|Chit Ko Ko Win]]</nowiki>, Ubuntu Myanmar LoCo Team Core Member during Raspberry Pi course, I started loving {*} .

Currently I have installed {*} 15.04 on my Dell laptop and "Ubuntu UCSY 14.04" on Desktop. "Ubuntu UCSY" is my own customization, customized for the university I'm attending now, University of Computer Studies,Yangon(UCSY).

I'm the head of Organizer of IT-Camp 2015 my university and Public Relation Team Organizer. I'm also a Leader of LastBench, a FOSS team in my university. I have developed "Ubuntu UCSY 14.04" 32-bit in 2014 and 64-bit in 2015 with my lastbench team members and have organized a FOSS@UCSY to share knowledge about FOSS and Linux where core member from Ubuntu Myanmar Loco Team and Fedora Myanmar participated as speakers.
