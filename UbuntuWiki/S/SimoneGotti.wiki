__TOC__

== Simone Gotti ==

* Gentoo developer until May 2005 (motaboy). Moved to ubuntu as it's finally the debian it was searching for a lot of time.
* Kdebluetooth developer.
* I like to fix bugs in some projects like kde. I made various pactches like the ability for kppp to support multiple modems profiles.
* Author (with Marco D'Itri) of the isapnp.rc hotplug scripts used also by ubuntu.

Joined the goodness of ubuntu (and kubuntu) and would be happy to help them improving this distro.
