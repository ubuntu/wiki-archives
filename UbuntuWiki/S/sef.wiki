'''About Me'''

I have used GNU/Linux since April 2002, and have been Ubuntu forum member since Dec 2005 and a moderator since July 2006.  

'''Participation'''

I help out mostly in x64-bit Systems, Absolute Beginners, Installation and Upgrades, and, more recently, in the Testing and Discussion room upon install of the development Ubuntu.

'''Summary'''

I contribute to Ubuntu Forums as much as is possible.  In addition, I have helped people install Ubuntu, and talk about it to people about Ubuntu and GNU/Linux.
