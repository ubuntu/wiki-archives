== What ==
Very small tests, but I aim at taking part in the Translation Group (English-Italian) and in the Testing Group.

"If you have an apple and I have an apple and we exchange these apples then you and I will still each have one apple. But if you have an idea and I have an idea and we exchange these ideas, then each of us will have two ideas."   --  George Bernard Shaw
