=== Notes ===

==== Brightness ====
Manual brightness control (via key shortcuts) was not working from the very beginning. It works fine after last kernel update. Currently I'm using kernel (uname -a):
<pre>
Linux pawelg-laptop 2.6.20-16-generic #2 SMP Thu Jun 7 20:19:32 UTC 2007 i686 GNU/Linux
</pre>

==== Shutdown ====
Not worked fine from the very beginning. When I made shutdown, progress bar indicated finish, but laptop was still running. I had to power off manually (by pressing power button). It works fine after last kernel update (kernel details: see above).

=== Touchpad ===
Tapping and scrolling works fine after installing ''synaptics'' package, and adding these lines into my ''/etc/X11/xorg.conf'':

==== 3D acceleration ====
I still have problems with running Beryl/Compiz. Maybe it's a ATI X1600 graphic card problem, or maybe some other issue. I'm currently using standard KDE KWin manager - all works fine and fast.

EDIT/2007-07-30: I just got information from other Aristo Prestige 1600 user, that reports no problems with 3D effects using . However I still have problems, but this may due my weird installation issue (kubuntu first then ubuntu as ubuntu-base package

==== Bluetooth ====
Works fine from the scratch.

==== Card reader ====
Works fine from the scratch. Currently tested with 2 SD cards.
