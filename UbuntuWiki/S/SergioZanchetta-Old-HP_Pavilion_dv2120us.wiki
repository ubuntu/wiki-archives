=== Current Issues ===
Wireless network adaptor needs ndiswrapper.  Using ndiswrapper 1.26 and Broadcom 4311 driver (Card: Dell Wireless 1390 WLAN MiniCard (Dell Inspiron E1505, Dell Latitude D620, Dell Inspiron 640m, Dell Inspiron E1405, Compaq Presario V3010AU, V3011AU) http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/mediawiki/index.php/List
This driver works for a few minutes and then has IRQ problems.  Fixed by passing irqpoll option to  kernel (Linux version 2.6.15-27-k7 (buildd@terranova) (gcc version 4.0.3 (Ubuntu 4.0.3-1ubuntu5)) #1 SMP PREEMPT Sat Sep 16 02:35:20 UTC 2006)

Also alsa driver does not work with front plugs. If you plug in headphones it continues to play through built in speakers. This bug is reported and there are directions to recompile to make it work but I havent gotten around to trying them.
