=== Current Issues ===

* Installed via netboot (no cdrom, doesn't support boot off USB drives). 

* Note on ACPI hotkey support: All Fn+key combinations trigger a "sony/hotkey SPIC 00000001 000000##" event in /var/log/acpid. Any references to these keys will just be written as HOTKEY##.

* The wifi switch seems to disable the radio, but the corresponding ACPI event is not wired up to ifup/down.
