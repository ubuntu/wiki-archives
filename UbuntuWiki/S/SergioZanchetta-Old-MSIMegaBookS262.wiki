[1]You have to add r1000 to /etc/modules to get the RealTek eth0 interface to work.

[2]To use HID devices without having to manually start a server and connect them every time, set HIDD_OPTIONS in /etc/defaults/bluez_utils to 1

[3]You have to manually run the hibernate script, and when it comes back up, the screen is scrambled. To fix the video, switch to a console and switch back. I haven't tried to get sleep button or power button to hibernate yet.
