__TOC__



== Intended tasks: ==

* Get rid of all bugs without package. Now that new bugs without a package don't have place in launchpad, one thing to do is assign the existent ones to their corresponding package. At the time of this writing, there are 2836 <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bugs?field.status%3Alist=NEW&field.importance%3Alist=UNDECIDED&assignee_option=none&field.has_no_package=on|bugs without a package]]</nowiki>. Uptate: 264 left!
* I have formally adopted the aMule package. My first intended task is to clean up the <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/amule|bugs page]]</nowiki> from old ones and keep the new controlled.
