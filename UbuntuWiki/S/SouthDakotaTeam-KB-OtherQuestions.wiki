Less frequently asked questions can be found in the <nowiki>[[ SouthDakotaTeam-KB | KB ]]</nowiki>. We can also answer questions using the mailing list, forums, or IRC.

Never hesitate to ask questions. We understand not every user will know everything coming out of the gate. In fact, we expect you know nothing and anything extra you know is a bonus to the initiative.
