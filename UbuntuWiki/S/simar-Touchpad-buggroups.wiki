__TOC__

Many of the touchpad bugs have a lot of common features, as well as there are many duplicates on different laptop and touchpad models, others are too closely related. This is the primary reason, I'm grouping some of the bugs to keep track of them in a better way and handle them easily.

=== Horizontal Scrolling do not work ===

The most closely related bug and there are a lot of them, many of which may be mere duplicates because of some common deviation of the touchpad, or they may be in same touchpads in different laptop models.
