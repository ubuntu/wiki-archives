== Development ==
This page is where the main information regarding SpeechControl's development can be found.

=== Blueprints ===
For all of the blueprints, just visit <nowiki>[[SpeechControl-Blueprints#Blueprints|this page]]</nowiki>.

=== Projects ===
SpeechControl's Development team sets out to bring the finest and latest equipment in voice and speech utilities for the Ubuntu distributions. Currently, SpeechControl's aimed at bringing the Java application <nowiki>[[http://mary.dfki.de|openMary TTS]]</nowiki> to Ubuntu. Its ability to emulate emotional speech using diphone voices introduces a new playing field of speech synthesis. We're also aiming at bringing voice recognition (compared to speech recognition) to Ubuntu. Using the <nowiki>[[http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net|CMU Sphinx]]</nowiki> library as portrayed in this <nowiki>[[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEUeJb6Pwt4&feature=player_embedded|video]]</nowiki>, having IRC chat a bit more accessible for those who don't have perfect eyesight, as done in <nowiki>[[https://www.launchpad.net/cmusphinx-train|this bot]]</nowiki>'s project description.

With such projects integrated in Ubuntu, developers would be able to profess more accessible and dynamic application interfaces for end-users.
