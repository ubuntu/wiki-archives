Hi everyone....

I am a contributor of launchpad.

Now I'm working on Bengali Translation of Linux Mint,Kubuntu and Ubuntu...

I also keep an eye on <nowiki>[[https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu|Ubuntu related questions]]</nowiki>.

I also contribute in bug squad.

I am in my 3rd year of completing graduation.

I love open-source softwares and I hate piracy.

For Pirated windows users.. I can say only one thing... Either go for genuine Microsoft products or 

Upgrade your life to a free, innovative world.

Because..... Life is tooooooooooo short for REBOOOOOOOOOOOOOTING.. :) :)

and In silent nights.. I can hear.. windows machines rebooting....

For two months I am going through a big thing.

I think I will be fully available from next March/April again.

Pray for me.

Feel free to <nowiki>[[http://mailhide.recaptcha.net/d?k=01EIXbtAtgSu6m5H70_du87A==&c=vOB46PlZlALyiq8OcBntf1WzAFStJToPap6Hluu97Sg=|contact me]]</nowiki>
