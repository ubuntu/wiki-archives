=== Current Issues ===
==== Hardy Heron (8.04 LTS) ====
* The stylus does not work out of the box. To get it working:
** Use Track Point knob to open Applications > Accessories > Terminal and type
<code>sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf</code>
** Add the following text somewhere at the start: <pre>
Section "InputDevice"
	Driver		"wacom"
	Identifier	"stylus"
	Option		"Device"	"/dev/input/wacom"
	Option		"Type"		"stylus"
	Option		"ForceDevice"	"ISDV4"
	Option		"Button2"	"3"		# Right click
EndSection

Section "InputDevice"
	Driver		"wacom"
	Identifier	"eraser"
	Option		"Device"	"/dev/input/wacom"
	Option		"Type"		"eraser"
	Option		"ForceDevice"	"ISDV4"
	Option		"Button3"	"2"		# Eraser
EndSection

Section "InputDevice"
	Driver		"wacom"
	Identifier	"cursor"
	Option		"Device"	"/dev/input/wacom"
	Option		"Type"		"cursor"
	Option		"ForceDevice"	"ISDV4"
EndSection
</pre>
** Add these three devices to the "ServerLayout" section as follows: <pre>
Section "ServerLayout"
	Identifier	"Default Layout"
	Screen		"Default Screen"
	InputDevice     "stylus"	"SendCoreEvents"
	InputDevice     "cursor"	"SendCoreEvents"
	InputDevice     "eraser"	"SendCoreEvents"
	InputDevice	"Synaptics Touchpad"
EndSection
</pre>
** Save the file and log out to restart X. Thanks to http://www.krizka.net/2007/12/27/thinkpad-x61-tablet-and-ubuntu-hardy-heron for the changes above.

==== Gutsy Gibbon ====
* EASY FIX: screen rotation works but pen tracking does not follow
** Use the rotscreen.new script from https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/133430
* EASY FIX: screen almost black on resume from suspend
** Switch to a console (Ctrl-Alt-6) and then back again (Ctrl-Alt-7) to re-enable backlight
* EASY FIX: Enable tablet functions - uncomment tablet lines as indicated in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
* EASY FIX: enable pen button - modify /etc/X11/xorg.conf as follows:
** add the following line to to Section InputDevice - Driver wacam - Identifier stylus as follows:
** Option  "Button2" "3"
** add the following line to Section InputDevice - Driver wacam - Identifier eraser
** Option  "Button3" "2"

==== Notes ====
For 8.04 LTS:
* Installed using "wubi" from Windows Vista.
* Install paused for several minutes on "Scanning the mirror..." but was otherwise smooth.
* External monitor detected but could not uncheck the "clone displays" box.
* Hibernation did not shut machine off. I think the wubi installer mentioned that this doesn't work w/ wubi.
* A bit tricky to get sound recording to work: open sound recorder, choose File > Open Volume Control, choose Edit > Preferences, check the Capture box, toggle audio recording on on Recording tab, and then use Options tab to choose source (internal / external mic). Then tell the recorder to record from input Capture.
* Can rotate screen from System > Preferences > Screen Resolution if hardware acceleration turned off (add <code>Option "DRI" "false"</code> to the Device in the xorg.conf file), but so far no luck rotating the input (ie. cursor moves left/right instead of up/down).
