==== Notes ====
* System seems to have problems with DVD drives, but after replacing the faulty CD-ROM originally installed with a working CDROM, the disk errors I was having previously went away.
* Karmic Desktop installed with no problems, but Karmic Server would not detect the RAID array.  Loading the ips module did not work, nor did it work switching to tty2 and modprobing the module.  Ips is what is listed in the lshw from Karmic Desktop.  I have not filed a bug report for this yet, but I have a forum post here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=8879125
* Raid rebuild takes about 30 seconds to start rebuilding onto the hot-swap drive.  The system is still usable and responsive during this time, as well as while it is rebuilding the array.  
* In its current configuration, hdparm -Tt shows cached reads between 212 and 214 MB/s and buffered reads between 11 and 12 MB/s
