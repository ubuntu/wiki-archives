__TOC__

* Contact: JustinDugger
* Brand: Toshiba
* Make : Tecra
* Model: M7

=== Current Issues ===
* '''Major:''' Tablet rotate doesn't happen automatically. There are ready to use scripts (two sorts of them) on the web to do this for you.
* '''Major:''' Can't toggle video out. You can tune xorg.conf yourself to make video-out work as you want it to (sorta very complicated to get it all the ways right). Bug <nowiki>[[http://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/show_bug.cgi?id=14071|#14071]]</nowiki>
* '''Moderate:''' Have to <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WacomTroubleshooting|tune xorg.conf]]</nowiki> to get digitizer (Tablet) work perfectly. At least install and use wacom-tools to configure pen correctly.
* '''Moderate:''' Fingerprint reader doesn't work automatically. But it's easy to setup ThinkFinger to do the job.
* '''Minor:''' Have to set up tablet keys and joypad yourself by the means of "thirdparty" packages (there are plenty of them for any taste).

Feel free to contact me (Bulat on a launchpad.com site) to resolve this issues. On my Toshiba Tecra M7 I have working with Hardy (8.04.1):
* digitizer(Tablet),
* mirror video-out,
* automatic tablet screen rotation,
* fingerprint support for loggin in,
* sound working simultaneously in several applications and built-in mic working in Skype.
It's all on the web, so you can at first try to figure it out yourself - it's not so hard.

P.S. Don't know what to do with TPM and 3D Accelerometer and how to test them - maybe there is support in Ubuntu.  3D Accelerometer should be fun thing - you can tilt you laptop to give it commands (there's such software for other OSes). :)

==== Notes ====
Tablet functionality partly there. After installing `wacom-tools`, the pointer follows the pen, and tapping works as a click (and double tapping triggers double click) but the pen buttons are usually messed up. Running `xsetwacom set stylus button2 3` will fix some functionality for me, as does the dubious `xsetwacom set stylus button1 1`. 

Cursor overlay switches 789UIOJKL keys into Home Up PgUp Left Right etc. mode.
