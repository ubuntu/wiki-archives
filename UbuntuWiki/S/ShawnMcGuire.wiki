=== About Me ===

I've been an IT professional for about 3 years, but I've always been into computers since I was young.  It wasn't until the last 5 years that I started my journey into programming and development.  Within the last 3 years I started getting into Open Source projects and the Open Source scene.  I'm always looking to work on new projects and contribute to Open Source communities as much as I can.
