Hi, Being a relative noob to Ubuntu (and actually mostly Xubuntu) don't know yet what expertise I can offer but here's a list of things that I've got working with the Gutsy Gibbon / 7.10 release of Xubuntu (x86_64 version in most cases) on at least a couple machines.

* BOINC - (Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing) v5.10.8 & upgrade to v5.10.28 <nowiki>[[http://skipsjunk.net/skipsother/boinc_v5_10_28_upgrade.doc]]</nowiki> (./)
 <nowiki>[[File:boinc_logo.gif]]</nowiki>
* x11vnc - relatively unsecured access to remote Xubuntu machines within my LAN w/ resumable sessions from others and from winXP
* SAMBA - simple, unsecured guest access to shared drive space across LAN with winXP & Ubuntu machines having access to those drives (instead of buying a NAS)
