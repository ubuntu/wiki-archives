==== About Me ====
After being a fan of Ubuntu since the early days, I finally found a way to help by joining the BugSquad. Until then I had no idea that I could help without having developer skills or without donating money. I'm feeling all excited about being able to give the Ubuntu and Linux community something back in my own way, however small that might be.

My chosen avatar is probably known to many as the vanilla version of Sackboy from Little Big Planet. I think that avatar encompasses everything I would like to stand for i.e. silly with an element of serious, dedicated but having fun and, lastly but not least, loving games.

==== Use ====
I currently use !GameDrift version 1 (<nowiki>[[http://gamedrift.org]]</nowiki>) which is an Ubuntu derivative. !GameDrift integrates <nowiki>[[http://www.codeweavers.com/products/cxgames/|CodeWeaver's CrossOver for Games]]</nowiki> seamlessly and is so far the most impressive distribution, I have used, which combines two of my interests - computer games and Linux.

==== Learning ====
I want to learn everything but here is a list of where I want to start:
* The triage process focused on Desktop related issues
* Manage the end to end bug process on my own

==== Goal ====
* Be a fully fledged member of the Ubuntu BugSquad
* Be actively involved in the community
* Get an Ubuntu Forum rating that is slightly higher than "Ubuntu Green Coffee Beans" ;)

==== Thanks to ====
* Wife for always supporting me
* <nowiki>[[starcraft.man]]</nowiki> for letting me use his wiki page as inspiration
* !GameDrift for creating a great distribution
* Ubuntu and Ubuntu Community for everything else ;)
