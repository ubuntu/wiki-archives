Hey there ! I think It's time for an introduction I ..... , my name is Sharat Garg. I live in Jagadhri City Of Haryana, India. For those of my friends abroad, let me tell you all one thing : I love my country and don't underestimate us Indians, We are the Best. I study in Sacred Heart Convent Senior Secondary School, a couple or more of branches of which may be in your country too. Let's not give it all here in detail, the rest of the pages might be left empty!! ;)

=== My Birth ===
I was born on 16th of December 2001, a Sunday and was named Sharad, meaning winters, however, later my name was changed from Sharad to Sharat by my great grandmother.I was white as ivory at the time of my birth, which is unusual in India, that's why I was always called 'Baraf Ka Gola' by my mother, which means 'a ball of snow' in Hindi, my native language.
