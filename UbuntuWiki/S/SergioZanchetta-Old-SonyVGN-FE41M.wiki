=== Current Issues ===
Function buttons "S1 & S2" do not work (system thinks they are brightness +/- ), and brightness is not working off Fn Keys. Both sets of keys make the GUI respond with the brightness bar (which moves correctly) but no change in actual brightness happens.

Only the Mute HARDWARE button works on current build (although GUI responds correctly no volume change happens).

(NOW FIXED in current "Jaunty" build)*Screensaver fades screen but then returns to desktop*

(NOW FIXED in current "Jaunty" build) System hangs on shutdown.
