=== About Me ===

I'm an early user and advocate of Linux, and more generally Open Source Software, in the business world.
I've been around with computers and particularly linux for some time now,
and during all these years I've been using and promoting opensource technologies.

I started using Linux in 1995 with a French Slackware, called Kheops. My first contact with Ubuntu was in 2006 with Edgy.
Former Perl Monger, my preferred language is now Python. I know about web standards and design, HTML/CSS, and some QML/Javascript.

The early years of my career were spent developing the French high speed train (TGV) RTOS.
My professional activities also led me to several QA related positions and to Android phones integration before joining Canonical in 2010.
I'm now working for the Hardware Certification Team at Canonical.

=== Contributions ===

==== System Testing aka CheckBox ====

I'm one of the main contributors of <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/checkbox|CheckBox]]</nowiki> (development and bug-fixing)
and I'm very involved in the full rewrite of its new core, <nowiki>[[https://plainbox.readthedocs.org/en/latest/|PlainBox]]</nowiki> since its inception.

With 14.04 our goal was to not only use PlainBox as the core of CheckBox but also
to provide to Ubuntu users the brand new UI built using the (QML) Ubuntu SDK.
I led a <nowiki>[[http://summit.ubuntu.com/uds-1311/meeting/21988/core-1311-checkbox-rebirth/|session]]</nowiki> during vUDS 1311 explaining our <nowiki>[[https://blueprints.launchpad.net/checkbox/+spec/core-1311-checkbox-rebirth|plans]]</nowiki> to get it done.

My contributions to the QML gui can be checked <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/checkbox-ihv-ng|here]]</nowiki>.

I'm the <nowiki>[[http://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=sylvain.pineau@canonical.com|Debian maintainer]]</nowiki> of several new CheckBox dependencies that we upstreamed this cycle (14.04).
I followed the Main Inclusion process for all of them even requesting manual <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/1278747|sync]]</nowiki> after DebianImportFreeze to make 14.04 the LTS with <nowiki>[[http://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/checkbox-gui|checkbox-gui]]</nowiki> as the default CheckBox client.

I also did a couple of <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/checkbox/+bugs?field.status%3Alist=FIXRELEASED&field.bug_reporter=sylvain-pineau|CheckBox uploads]]</nowiki> to Ubuntu, especially the one merging the changelog from the dev branch (0.15)

</a>
</pre>

I also try to devote some of my free time to help Ubuntu users. I'm a <nowiki>[[http://askubuntu.com/help/privileges/trusted-user|trusted user]]</nowiki> on Ask Ubuntu where I (amongst other things) try to help people getting started with <nowiki>[[http://askubuntu.com/tags/qml/topusers|QML]]</nowiki> applications developement using the Ubuntu SDK.

==== Various contributions to Test Automation ====

I'm a big fan of computer vision frameworks, I recently created a new <nowiki>[[https://code.launchpad.net/~sylvain-pineau/checkbox/screenshot_opencv_validation/+merge/203707|test]]</nowiki> to
validate screenshots using an external webcam and OpenCV, meant to be used in our SRU labs.

<nowiki>[[https://code.launchpad.net/~sylvain-pineau/xpresser/gtk3-port-with-SimpleCV/+merge/113582|GTK3 port]]</nowiki> of XPresser using SimpleCV.

Do you remember Mago? I developed a Totem automated playback <nowiki>[[http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~apulido/mago/shotwell_natty/revision/142|test]]</nowiki> using a spectral analysis.

==== SRU Hardware Testing ====

As a step in the process of releasing kernel updates through the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/kernel-sru-workflow|SRU process]]</nowiki>, the new kernel is tested on all of the hardware which we certified for that release.
I'm the lead engineer on this task. 

=== Future Goals ===

I intend to continue contributing to test automation tools wherever it is needed that will help to bring Ubuntu to a high standard of quality together with an innovative user experience.
I'd like also to take more responsibilities in Debian/Ubuntu as my packaging skills are getting better after each release by becoming a DebianMaintainer/MOTU.

==== Brendan Donegan ====

Sylvain is an excellent engineer and an all around great guy. He is extremely technically capable and pragmatic on top of that - a trait that I think is extremely valuable, especially in an open source community. As can clearly be seen his track record in contributing to the Ubuntu project is extensive and reaches to all different levels, up to and including Debian itself. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend him for Ubuntu membership. -- <nowiki>[[Launchpad:~brendan-donegan]]</nowiki>

==== Daniel Manrique ====
Sylvain would be a great asset to the Ubuntu community. As you can see from his
profile, his experience is broad and his knowledge very ample (but I know from
experience he can also learn any new technology in record time). He's also a
very calm and composed person, which is an asset in heated technical
discussions. On top of all that, he's very patient and accessible when making
his knowledge available to those who need it, which, again, is a very desirable
trait in Ubuntu members. I'd wholeheartedly recommend him for membership, both
as a recognition of his existing contributions and as a tool for him to
continue expanding his participation in the community. This is the kind of
people we want spearheading and representing Ubuntu. -- <nowiki>[[Launchpad:~roadmr]]</nowiki>

==== Ara Pulido ====
Sylvain is a joy to work with and will be a great addition to Ubuntu's community. His broad knowledge and his experience with test automation will be a great asset for Ubuntu, both for 14.04 and later for the convergence story. We were all surprised that he wasn't a member yet, as his years of contributions made us all think that he was a member for a long time ago. -- <nowiki>[[Launchpad:~apulido]]</nowiki>

==== Zygmunt Krynicki ====

Sylvain works with me on the Canonical Hardware Certification team and I have very high opinion of him. His enthusiasm, knowledge and creativity is excellent and stimulating. He's got deep, practical knowledge of the complexities, infrastructre and coordination processes related to real-world commercial hardware certification. He's a pleasure to work with. I look forward to all the contributions he makes to Ubuntu as both Canonical employee and Ubuntu member. -- <nowiki>[[Launchpad:~zkrynicki]]</nowiki>
