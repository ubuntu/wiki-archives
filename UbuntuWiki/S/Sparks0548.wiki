=== Introduction ===
I'm a 31 year old father of one.  My son is a great joy in my life who helped me remember what it was like to play and be a kid.  I'm a Rhode Island native and enjoy spending time having beers with friends, playing ice hockey and 
sometimes getting into trouble.

==== Active Duty ====
I have been involved with Linux for a few years and have spent the better part of a year and a half advocating Ubuntu to my friends & family.  I have spent 12 years in the military in the active duty and reserve space.  My first position in the Navy was as a Radioman onboard the <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Yorktown_%28CG-48%29/|USS Yorktown (CG-48)]]</nowiki>.  There I started my computing experience onboard the SmartShip platform.  Our main mission was in support of the United States' counter drug mission in the Carribbean. 

==== Computer Experience ====
After leaving active duty I worked for a few organizations in New England in the Finance, Higher Education, and Manufacuring industries honing my skills and climbing the corporate ladder.  I have spent the better part of 8 years in the Litigation Market as a Senior Systems Engineer and Data Forensics Expert.  This job led me begin using Linux for a variety of cases which spurred my interest in Linux and Ubuntu. 

==== Seabee Reservist ====
While working in the civilian world and post 9/11 I was brought back into the military to serve with the US Navy Seabees.  The <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabee/|Seabees]]</nowiki> have a long history of "Can Do".  As a matter of fact I believe it was the Seabees that coined the phrase.  A commissioned organization on March 5, 1942 the Seabees had their first home in Rhode Island in support of World War II.  As a Seabee my current rating is a SteelWorker where I work on construction projects welding, cutting, or fabrication with many different metal materials.  I have recently been awarded the Seabee Combat Warfare Specialist Qualification for professional knowledge, leadership and devotion to duty.  Currently serving with the Seabees in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom I continue my military career working to protect freedom, our way of life and ensuring the safety and security of my children.
