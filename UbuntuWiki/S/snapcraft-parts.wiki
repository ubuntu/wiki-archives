*** Change the dynamic loader ("ELF interpreter") of executables.
*** Change the RPATH of executables and libraries.
*** Shrink the RPATH of executables and libraries.
*** Remove declared dependencies on dynamic libraries (DT_NEEDED
      entries).
*** Add a declared dependency on a dynamic library (DT_NEEDED).
*** Replace a declared dependency on a dynamic library with another one

description: |
  Helpers for gtk2, gtk3, qt4 and qt5 or gnome-platform and glib minimal launchers.
  It brings the necessary code and exports for binding and using those
  desktop technologies in a relocatable fashion, enabling binding with
  global desktop theme, icon theme, image caching, fonts, mimetype handlers
  application global menu and gsettings integration.
  It also brings basics ubuntu dependency packages.
  .
  Usage:
    1. add "after: [desktop-<technology>]" to your launcher:
       - gtk2, gtk3, qt4 and qt5 corresponds to their respective toolkit
         main dependencies and default choices.
       - gnome-platform is similar to gtk3 without the extra depends, it's
         meant to be used with the gnome platform which already includes those.
       - glib-only enables to compile mime types and gsettings infos. If you
         added your own graphical drivers, it will link them as well.
    2. prepend your command with "desktop-launch", like:
       commands: "desktop-launch foo" if foo is in $PATH. You can as well
       specify: "desktop-launch $SNAP/foo".
    3. add needed plugs to your application:
       - for graphical application:
         plugs: [x11 (or unity7 for appmenu integration)]. Think about adding
         opengl if you need hw acceleration.
       - if your application needs access to sound:
         plugs: [pulseaudio]
       - accessing to user's home directory:
         plugs: [home]
       - read/write to gsettings:
         plugs: [gsettings]
       - use of the shared platform snap content, first define the plug:
           plugs:
             gnome-3-26-1604:
               interface: content
               target: gnome-platform
               default-provider: gnome-3-26-1604:gnome-3-26-1604
         and then make your apps use it:
           plugs: [gnome-3-26-1604]
         Note that an empty "gnome-platform" directory will be created for you
         in your snap.

  - desktop-gtk2

  Add tomcat-with-ssl to your snap to enable SSL on port 443 for tomcat (no apache required).
  Lets Encrypt's 'certbot' is used to obtain a valid certificate. Tomcat exposes port 443 directly
  so there is no need to add apache or ngnix as a proxy.
  After installing your snap you need to run <yoursnapname>.getcert <youremail> <fqdn-of-webapp>
  Your server MUST have port 80 exposed when you run get cert and you must have an public DNS entry for
  the FQDN of your web server.
  Additional documentation at: https://github.com/bsutton/tomcat-with-ssl-snap

  Usage:
  To use this part, include the following in your snapcraft.yaml:
    apps:

  wxWidgets is a C++ library that lets developers create applications for Windows, macOS, Linux and other platforms with a single code base. It has popular language bindings for Python, Perl, Ruby and many other languages, and unlike other cross-platform toolkits, wxWidgets gives applications a truly native look and feel because it uses the platform's native API rather than emulating the GUI. It's also extensive, free, open-source and mature.

  This remote part ships a recent wxWidgets release to your snap, refer the following snapcraft forum topic for more info:
