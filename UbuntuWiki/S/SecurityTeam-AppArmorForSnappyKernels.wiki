=== About apparmor3 for snappy developer kernels ===
Official snappy systems will have officially maintained kernels, but developers interested in trying out snappy with their own kernels can do so by updating to Apparmor3 in their kernels. Ubuntu already did this to its phablet kernels, and the methods used for snappy developer kernels will be similar.

== Support Notes ==
=== Installing snappy ===
Please see the snappy <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/snappy|announcement and documentation]]</nowiki> for how to install snappy.

=== Updating the kernel in the VM ===
MORE HERE:
# install snappy in a VM
# boot the VM
# remount '/' as 'rw: <code>sudo mount -o remount,rw /</code>
# copy the kernel into place
# remount '/' as 'ro': <code>sudo mount -o remount,ro /</code>
# reboot
