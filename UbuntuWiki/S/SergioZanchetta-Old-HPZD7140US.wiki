==== Notes ====

(Gutsy/Hardy:) Wireless (Broadcom 4306) needs restricted firmware, requiring use of wired NIC (RTL8139) and reboot.
On startup, wireless seems to default to Off, requiring hitting the wireless key to enable it, then
selecting wireless networking and unselecting wired. Works fine then.

(Intrepid:) Upgrade disabled networking applet functionality, required cleaning up settings and reboot. Worked fine after.

Fn-F5 Sleep puts system to sleep, but powering back up has no screen response on default config.

Music and Photo keys can be configured under Keyboard Shortcuts, but don't seem to do anything.

Card reader tested with SD card, insert/remove shows no messages in syslog/messages/dmesg.
