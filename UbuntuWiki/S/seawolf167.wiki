=== About Me ===

I am an I.T. Professional holding degrees in Math, Mechanical Engineering and Industrial Engineering. My work is currently 75% Windows System Administration, however, the remaining 25% are Debian-based servers and client computers. I try to keep learning and expanding my knowledge of Linux and waiting patiently until all closed source applications have their equivalent in FOSS.

I live in Minnesota and in my spare time I'm team captain of my GS Race Team as well as a Personal Coach for Track and Cross Country Runners. I love running, inline skating, downhill skiing and cycling.

The Ubuntu Community was very helpful to me as I learned Linux and I was able to migrate to Ubuntu. I still refer to the Ubuntu Community Documentation on a near-daily basis.
