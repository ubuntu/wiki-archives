=== About Me ===

Hello everyone, I'm resident of Punjab(India), student of computer engineering, enjoys open source and knowledge sharing. Besides that, I believe in original ideas and original research. I like to contribute to humanity some way, so I decided to get involved in free and open software.

=== My Contribution ===

1. Recreated DebuggingTouchpadDetection.
2. Created Xev
3. Created Evtest
2. Bugs Triage related to Touchpad
3. Currently mentoring two students ahmed and stanley_robertso.
4. Fixed some FTBFS. So I'm trying my hand out in packaging. Here are some of patches that I submitted.
** https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/kball/+bug/611867
** https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/wvstreams/+bug/602134

See my ubuntu membership (<nowiki>[[simar-MembershipApplication|Application]]</nowiki>) for more detailed work.
=== Presently working ===
1. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/simar/Touchpad
2. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/simar/Touchpad/xev

=== Areas of Interests ===
Almost all development work(in computers) that I think is upto my potential. I'm most interested in hardware related programming, IP programming (networks) and security.

I have quite a good knowledge of C and c++ and is coding for AVR and motorola related microcontrollers. I can code well in .NET framework which is of no use here though :( .. I'm working forward to learn atleast one high level cross-platform language like python with a lot of API available, so I can have a substitute of .net here. I have also tried my hand in symbian and have successfully created some symbian S60 applications. 

=== Projects I am interested and working on ===

Other than Ubuntu I would like to contribute to linux and security area.

=== Future Plans ===
* Ubuntu Bug Control Team Membership -  Done (a particular thanks to Sense for that :) )
* Ubuntu Membership(<nowiki>[[simar-MembershipApplication|Application]]</nowiki>)
* Ubuntu Contributing Developer

My life goal is to become a good personality and contribute to society in the field of technology ...
