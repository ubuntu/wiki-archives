Welcome to Soo-Hyun Choi's Ubuntu Wiki.

I am a PhD student studying computer networks at University College London (University of London). I have been using FreeBSD for about 5 years, and now I am gradually switching to Ubuntu Linux.

My main interests include design and development of computer communication protocols (congestion control protocols), network/systems security (applied cryptography and security protocols), and a bit of operating systems (network side).
