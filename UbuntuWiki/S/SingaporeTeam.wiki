=== Introduction ===
'''Team Ubuntu Singapore''' comprises of a few individuals who are brought together by a common belief in the virtues of the Open Source model and more specifically by the possibilities made possible because of Ubuntu OS. Our full list of members is located at our launchpad team profile. 

Unlike the more established organisations such as Linux User Group Singapore (LUGS), Ubuntu Singapore is a small team with limited resources. As such, we cannot afford to spread ourselves too thinly and we need to be focused.

A potential project we considered embarking on is to create a Singapore-centric Ubuntu/Linux/OSS info resource on the Internet. This sounds like a do-able project given that the resources required need not be too substantial, and taps on the inclinations of the existing members.

==== Who is this group for? ====
This group is for anyone residing in Singapore, who uses or is interested in some flavour of Ubuntu, whether it's Ubuntu, Kubuntu or any others. This group is for people of all technical abilities from I've-never-heard-of-linux all the way to Ubuntu-Guru.

==== How do I join? ====
There is no official process to join, however if you join the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-sg-team|launchpad]]</nowiki> team you are then able to vote in polls organised by the group. Discussion happens on the <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-sg|mailing list]]</nowiki> which you are free to join. There is also an active group of members who chat in real time on IRC in the #ubuntu-sg channel on irc.freenode.net. Our website is temporarily offline.  But do come back again later to contribute articles and forums.

# Create articles and content for our website when it comes back online.
# Participate in local events or exhibitions
