== PHP 7.4 transition plan ==

Hi devs,
For focal the server team will be transitioning PHP to 7.4 over the
coming weeks.

Since version 7.0, upstream PHP has adopted a regular release cadence,
with one release per year.  Each release is supported for 2 years, plus
a third year of security critical fixes.[1]  Changes from 7.3 to 7.4 are
modest, but the extra year of upstream support is a tangible benefit for
the Ubuntu LTS.

While upstream released PHP 7.4 in December, Debian is still in process
of landing it in Experimental.  This means we'll need to temporarily go
a bit ahead of Debian unstable in order to pull the stack in prior to
our feature freeze.  We are building a list of php packages that will
need rebuilt, sync'd, and merged.

Some syntax changes and deprecated function calls have required
adjustments to tests in some cases, and merging in new upstream releases
in others.  For FTBFS issues that will inevitably crop up, make sure to
first check the Debian git repo for the package, as they've often
already seen and queued up the correct fix.
