== Skype and Web Cameras ==
This page lists web cameras ("webcams") that are known to work with <nowiki>[[Skype]]</nowiki>. This may differ from the list of webcams working in general on Ubuntu, given <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsMultimediaWebCameras|here]]</nowiki>. For general webcam issues see <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Webcam|here]]</nowiki>.

=== Instructions for contributing to the lists ===
* Specify which version of Skype you are using. The version number of Skype may be found in the  middle of the ''about'' box, from the main menu. Entries that don't specify a version usually refer to the first beta, please test using the latest beta available on the <nowiki>[[http://www.skype.com/intl/en/download/skype/linux/beta/|Skype Linux Beta]]</nowiki> page, or the last available stable release; Skype 2.0 (the version introducing webcam support) has been released as stable. Skype 2.0.0.72, for instance, is a Skype stable release (the latest one, at the moment I'm writing this).
* To find out the device ID of your webcam, typing '''lsusb''' in a terminal window will list all USB devices on your system. Try to find the relevant line for your webcam. The ID then appears after "ID" on that line, in the form xxxx:xxxx where each "x" is an hexadecimal digit 0-9, a-f.
* If your webcam is working on some applications other than Skype 2.0 beta, then it would be useful to know what particular driver your webcam is using. To find out, type '''lsmod | grep videodev'''. The driver name will appear on the line starting with "videodev".
* If your webcam works with V4L2, but not with V4L (you can check this with gstreamer-properties), you may try <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-914952.html|one of these hacks]]</nowiki>.
* Remember that Skype cannot access a camera video stream if another program (like Cheese or guvcview) is already viewing it. Close any such program and re-select the Skype video settings preview image before concluding that it doesn't work.

| Camera generally works fine in programs such as Ekiga with the patched driver as explained here <nowiki>[[http://forum.skype.com/index.php?showtopic=100897&st=40&p=465545&#entry465545]]</nowiki>. The patch also works with Skype 2.0.0.69, but limitations arise mainly from graphics card and drivers. Fglrx for ati and others are known to have problems, specially with video overlay. On some systems, it has been said one can make it work with Skype by using gstfakevideo. The camera was successfully used with Skype via gstfakevideo on a laptop with Intel 945 graphics card under Ubuntu 7.10 using the default driver.  It is important though, to test the camera in an actual call, testing the camera on the options menu may show a black screen because of graphics driver problems, not webcam related.

Plays nicely together with built-in laptop camera for switching cams in both applications. Is offered in Skype 2.2.0.35 as available camera, but does not work. Interferes with switching with built-in laptop camera until unplugged or restart. It used to work in older version of Ubuntu/Skype.

=== Preloading v4lcompat ===

Some webcams require the v4lcompat driver to be preloaded.  It does not ship out of the box with new versions of ubuntu.  You will have to install the driver package with aptitude and then modify the Skype launcher to preload the driver.  Here's how:

sudo bash
apt-get install libv4l-0:i386

Now edit the skype launcher to preload the driver.  If you are using xfce:

Right-click on apps menu -> Properties -> Edit menu -> Internet -> Right click on Skype -> Properties.

The command should be:

env PULSE_LATENCY_MSEC=30 LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libv4l/v4l1compat.so skype

=== Additional notes about video on Skype ===
If: 1. You can see video in Cheese or other applications; but 2. You only see a white rectangle in Skype when you activate video;and 3. Testing the video under the Skype Preferences fails; ''but'' 4. the person you are calling ''can'' see video of you from your webcam, then the problem may be Cairo-Dock.

If you use Cairo-dock, you are probably using the OpenGL version. Under Preferences -> Startup Applications, Edit your Cairo-Dock to start up with the command cairo-dock -c [rather than "cairo-dock -o" for Open GL]. Restart the X server (if you do not know what this means, then reboot).

If the image is too dark in Skype, but not in applications such as Cheese or aMSN, do ''sudo apt-get install luvcview'' and ''sudo luvcview''. Use the control at bottom left to increase brightness and the right bottom button in the middle of the bottom of the screen to exit the application.

Many variables can cause video in Skype to fail, and those variables keep changing. As of this writing (July 2010), Skype Beta is version 2.1.0.81. PulseAudio is working better with it. More people are using Compiz and even Cairo-dock, all of which is fine, but in this case the weak link in the chain is Cairo-dock using OpenGL, a.k.a. GLX-dock.

Credit for this fix goes to !MedievalChips, who posted this YouTube video:  ''<nowiki>[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZJjsBFIWIc|Video issues with Skype on UBUNTU 10.04 Beta FIXED]]</nowiki>''

(I have reposted here in text format so that search engines can find this more easily.)

You may need to modify the "Sound in" device in the "Sound devices" options menu, to point to USB device (as appropriate) instead of Default. Likewise, ensure that video input is correctly defined.

Besides checking under options > video devices and click test on the preview window in Skype 2.0, you can also try to make a test call to ''videoecho123''.

Sometimes, the additional users created by Ubuntu are not part of the ''video'' group, and therefore can't access the webcam.

Try unplugging all other USB devices except the camera. In my case, on Gutsy Gibbon, with Logitech Wireless Mouse plugged in, Logitech !QuickCam for Notebooks Deluxe worked for several seconds in gqcam, mplayer, and Ekiga, then the stream stopped and the application crashed.  The webcam works well in those applications with the mouse unplugged.

Try disabling compiz if you don't see any video.

You can also open a Terminal and type '''<code>LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libv4l/v4l1compat.so skype</code>''' to start Skype.

Wrong virtual sizing setting in /etc/X11/xorg.conf may cause Skype to crash when video is started.

=== Graphics cards, XV, Skype and gstfakevideo ===
There are a couple of issues that create problems getting webcams working with Skype.  The gstfakevideo driver will probably get things working, provided you have a suitable '''graphics card driver''' set up in xorg.conf

There is a highly significant thing called xv this is easily overlooked in the rush to get video working.

You need to install the gstreamer packages and try this out.

gstreamer-properties

Go to the video tab and test your camera with the default settings.  If it doesn't work with the plugin "autodetect" in "Default output", change it to "X Window System (No Xv)", then try again.

If that works and "X Window System (X11/XShm/Xv)" doesn't work, then you are using an incompatible graphics driver.

With my Intel 915 card it was using the Intel driver, which doesn't support Xv; changing it to the 810 driver allowed both modes to work.

The Skype release notes state that only having a single XV port will cause video to be seen one way only (no preview,with no Xv support you get nothing).  With gstfakevideo you may get the preview as well with a single XV port.

 gstfakevideo v4lsrc device=/dev/video0 ! videoscale ! ffmpegcolorspace

should launch Skype with /dev/video0 as the source and your camera output in a suitable format.

This has been tested with an old Logitech !QuickCam Messenger, listed above as not working
The gstreamer-properties test should show if your webcam works, more importantly it will show if your video driver has XV support. In some cases this may mean installing a different graphics card.
