=== Summary ===

A more structured approach to testing on armel platforms is needed to track porting and regressions.  Checkbox is currently setup for x86 and amd64 system testing.  Having a configuration for armel would help by reducing the false failures associated with non-existent hardware.

=== Release Note ===

This contains a customised test routine for testing on armel platforms with the CheckBox testing system.   

=== Design ===

Use Checkbox Editor to develop some tests that are meaningful to armel platform release.

=== Implementation ===

Create a package that includes customised test plans.
Tests should include existing tests that will run on armel along with tests specific to armel platforms.
 
=== Test/Demo Plan ===

=== BoF agenda and discussion ===
