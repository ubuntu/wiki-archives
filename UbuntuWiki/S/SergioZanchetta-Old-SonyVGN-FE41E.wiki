==== Notes ====

1. Not integrated in Ubuntu, but supported by the r5u870 module as of version 0.10, see <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/bugs/120434]]</nowiki>
2. The nvidia-settings utility can change external monitor and s-video settings on the fly. In Hardy, it can be found in "System -> Administration -> NVIDIA X Server Settings". To use tv-out, one may have to change the X configuration though; nvidia-settings only gives me a blank-and-white screen for composite (PAL) when configuring on-the-fly. S-Video is ok though.
3. Works with nVidia driver correctly configured, see <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NvidiaLaptopBinaryDriverSuspend]]</nowiki>.
4. Brightness can be controlled using the command-line utility smartdimmer.
5. Either the internal microphone or external line-in (or mic) can be selected with a switch in the volume control.
6. In progress, see <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=2789021]]</nowiki>. In Hardy, ACPI events are being generated but they don't work yet in the GUI; <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/bugs/23227]]</nowiki>
