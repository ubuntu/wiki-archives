'''Switching to Ubuntu-Linux from windows and other *nix'''

As i wrote above in my experience that my major work is on windows platform but in year 2001 i have developed my interest towards open source platform and i started my learning *nix , since then i shifted to different operating systems including redhat , freebsd , openbsd , fedora and finally i got break with Ubuntu Linux :) the best flavour of linux among such a competition where u can see new operating systems every day . The best of Ubuntu-Linux is a hassle free support and free shipment of cds and easy to use interface

'''My ubuntu linux experience'''

At first i install free version of Ubuntu 6.06 lts at my home pc and then i decided to take it as a career ending job , now i have spread Ubuntu linux to almost 14 working organizations and including internet cafes , Internet Cable Networks and gaming zone , currently i m maintaining 4 Ubuntu 6.06 based servers and 1 Ubuntu 6.10 based lamp server, 3 ubuntu 8.04 and 1 ubuntu 9.10 base asterisk servers, I am happy that ubuntu is now safe and much stable then any other Linux Distribution.
