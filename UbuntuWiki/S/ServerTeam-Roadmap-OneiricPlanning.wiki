=== Introduction ===

This page is specifically for the gathering of proposed features for the Oneiric (11.10) development cycle. Prior to UDS, we organized the proposed Ubuntu Server track sessions, based on a subset of the proposed features.  The list below represents each Ubuntu Server track session and the notes taken during the associated discussion.
