Hello, I'm Stephen Burke & I'm a software developer by day & I like to help out with random Ubuntu bugs in my down time.  I started by learning about <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PackagingGuide|packaging for Ubuntu]]</nowiki> which led me to make my first contribution by packaging an existing fix that was already submitted.  That was great to see the fix get into Karmic.  I hope to continue contributing in the future.
