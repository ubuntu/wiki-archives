==== Hand out CDs ====

* Contact ship-it about delivery times (->Bart: ''done'', ''received'')
* Ask around (lugs,?) for leftover ship-it CDs (->Tormod: ''done'')
* Anyone here got any?
* We'll get 30 Ubuntu 6.10 and Edubuntu 6.10 CDs from Matthias
* If needed, burn more Ubuntu 6.10 on demand.

Together with the CDs, a little photocopy with instructions/etc would be nice.
* For Edubuntu CDs, print out https://wiki.ubuntu.com/EdubuntuLeaflet

==== Stickers ====
We will get stickers from system76! For gluing on top of that "Designed for Something Bad" sticker you probably have :)
* order stickers (->Andreas: ''done'')
* bring to Bern (->Andrew: ''will do'')
