This is a spec created for bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gdm/+bug/3241
At the moment there is no trusted path to get to the login screen. This means that an attacker can create a fullscreen window that looks like a login screen, and wait for an unsuspecting victim to write in his password.

Use case:
Jim goes uses a corporate system as an ordinary user. He goes to the login screen and see the text: "You should always pres ctrl+alt+delete before you log in (click here for more info). "
He presses ctrl+alt+delete and can now log in.
The next time Jim uses the computer, he presses ctrl+alt+delete to get the login dialog, feeling more secure."

=Implementation
To implement this we need to be able to block ctrl+alt+delete from any userspace program, and make sure that GDM can retrieve information whenever this sequence is pressed.
