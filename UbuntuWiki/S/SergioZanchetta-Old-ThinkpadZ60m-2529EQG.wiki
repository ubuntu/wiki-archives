Since there was already a page for a Thinkpad z60m with different specs I added a new site with the models number as suffix. Hope this is ok?
See bottom for problems.

==== Notes ====

* Sleep (aka Suspend to RAM): The built-in card-reader doesn't allow the system to resume properly. Workaround: Add the line 'MODULES="sdhci mmc_block mmc_core"' to the file '/etc/default/acpi-support'.

* Volume-switch in gnome-panel: The headphone-mixer is selected per default. Should be switched to 'front' imho.

* I configured (with system -> settings -> powermanagement) my acpid to go to "sleep" when I close the LCD. If I shut the system down and immediately close the LCD the system goes to sleep while the shutdown-process is running. This is annoying! Workaround: add the line 'touch /var/lock/acpisleep' between the lines 'script' and 'script end' in file '/etc/event.d/rc0-poweroff'. If this file exists acpid does not accept any further events.

* Fingerprint-reader: Still no real opensource-drivers. Got it working (gdm + su) with the HOWTO at thinkwiki.org. Link:  http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/How_to_enable_the_fingerprint_reader

* Make the browser-keys work with the lines 'keycode 234 = XF86Back' and 'keycode 233 = XF86Forward' in your '~/.Xmodmap'.

* Fn-8 should enable/disable the touchpad. Therefore you need to add the line 'Option "SHMconfig" "true"' to the synaptics-section in '/etc/X11/xorg.conf'.

* If you want more features like HDAPS or tp_smapi (advanced battery management) have a look at http://www.thinkwiki.org/. Very good resource!

* Summary: nice linux-notebook, most things (I need) worked out-of-the-box or with little adjustments!
