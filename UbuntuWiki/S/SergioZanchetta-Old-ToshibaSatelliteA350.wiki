=== Current Issues ===
 Until now I've installed and tested 8.04.2 and 8.10. <<BR>>
I only tested these versions "out of the box", both the live cd and installed and update the release. I did not make any configuration changes in these tests.
 After the installation of 9.04 I will test as much as possible, because I plan the keep using this release on my laptop.

==== Notes ====
1) 8.04.2:
   In "System - Preferences - Screen Resolution" <<BR>>
   Resolution = off and Refresh Rate = blank, so I don't know what the actual resolution is. <<BR>>
2) 8.10:
   In "System - Preferences - Screen Resolution" <<BR>>
   Resolution = 1024x768 and Refresh Rate = blank <<BR>>
   The installation of this version needed to be executed in low resolution, otherwise you get a black screen. <<BR>>
3) Both 8.04.2, 8.10 and 9.04:
   The system is going down in either suspend and hibernate, but after power on the colors are garbled but the text is readable. After logout/login all looks fine.
