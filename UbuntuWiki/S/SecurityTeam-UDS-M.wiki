UDS Maverick planning

== Plans ==

=== Create Blueprints ===

==== Discussion Needed ====

* [kees] AppArmor upstream
** make user-space aware of tunables and aliases
** [jjohansen] change_profile pam_apparmor
** [jdstrand] clean up wiki documentation
** [sbeattie] find a release manager
** [sbeattie] clarify policies
** [jjohansen] create devel mailing list
* [kees] fscaps support in dpkg (needs packaging experts; cjwatson, slangasek)
* [mdeslaur] Create private directory by default even with no encryption (require pitti)
* [mdeslaur] GUI for ubuntu-support-status so desktop users can figure out if they're running software that may have security risks. Could we link this to our CVE tracker stats to give a risk assessment on universe software that has open CVEs? (required: mvo)
** provide an early notification of EOL in update-manager
* [mdeslaur] Session to brainstorm on how to handle CVE-2009-3555 with stable releases
* [kees] GPG key migration and application compatibility testing (required: cjwatson)
** migrate security team's keys
** document how to do migration
** document what software can't perform verifications any more
** check on gnupg vs gnupg2 upgrade path
* [mdeslaur] How to get security updates applied more easily? (required: mvo, mpt)
** is update-manager popup enough?
** is update-manager asynchronous popup a security issue with spoofing?
** should security updates be turned on automatically by default?
** should update-manager gain a "Always install security updates automatically in the future?" checkbox?
** remove password requirement for security updates? (an option in the update-manager settings panel?)
* [mdeslaur] Should gksudo and password dialogs show personal information to control spoofing? ie: a customized picture (required: pitti, mpt)

* [kees] popcon accuracy/update investigation (requires mvo)
* [kees] VMBuilder improvements (requires soren)
** sane partition sizings (parted "bug")
** grub2 by default
** add serial/console support to vm-new/vmbuilder
* [kees] discuss containers, lxc, etc, in the context of sbuild/schroot (CLONE_NEW* usage) (required: hallyn)
* [kees] discuss publishing security metrics (see <nowiki>[[http://www.redhat.com/security/data/metrics/|RH's metrics]]</nowiki> for examples)
* [jdstrand] tedg crackfest ;)
** app indicator area for security stuff-- apparmor-notify, ufw-notify, logfile-notify
* [kees] kernel hardening
** symlinks
** hardlinks
** ptrace
** add execshield toggles to our nx-emu patch, as RH does
** attempt to upstream nx-emu patch set
* [jdstrand] Community USNs (see https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-security-announce/2010-March/001055.html)
** create automated security announcements for universe security updates
* [jdstrand] discuss ways to rotate repsonsibilities: eg, traditionally kees has done kernel, jdstrand mozilla products and mdeslaur webkit
* [jdstrand] improve apparmor packaging

** write wiki page detailing types of 2 factor auth
** [jdstrand] create howto for remote access one-time password auth: <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HOTP|HOTP]]</nowiki>/<nowiki>[[http://yubico.com/products/yubikey/|yubikey]]</nowiki> (new) or opie s/key (old)
** create howto for USB key storage of ecryptfs key

** add appropriate howtos to official documentation
* [jdstrand] HTML USNs (reprise)
* [jdstrand] ufw (see <nowiki>[[SecurityTeam-Roadmap]]</nowiki>)
* [jdstrand] create a Security/Authentication page detailing various authentication mechanisms in Ubuntu, and how to properly use them
* [jdstrand] update the wiki page detailing various authorization mechanisms in Ubuntu, and how to properly use them (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Privileges)
* catch-all
** [kees] deroot auditd, get into main
** [kees] re-submit gcc testsuite updates (<nowiki>[[http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=39536|part 1]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=39537|part 2]]</nowiki>) to upstream
** [jdstrand] apparmor profile for chromium
** [jdstrand] investigate HIPL (Host Identity Protocol for Linux) for permanent, location-independent names for hosts. Could help with firewalling (needs ufw support).

==== Add to Roadmap ====

* [kees] work around i386 mono executable stack
* create wiki page for "How can the Ubuntu Security Team help Debian better?"
