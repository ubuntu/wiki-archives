=== About Me ===

I'm a visual artist, architect and Python hacker. 

=== Summary of Contributions to Ubuntu ===

I'm both active as an upstream author, translator and (co)maintainer of some packages in Ubuntu and Debian. For this I work in the Debian PAPT team. I give regularly presentations about graphics software or python at events such as Ubuntu release parties (both in Belgium and the Netherlands), <nowiki>[[http://www.libregraphicsmeeting.org|Libre Graphics Meeting]]</nowiki> and Europython. I also help users on the international and local ubuntu forums.

=== Description of Contributions to Ubuntu ===

==== Upstream Development ====

When I switched to Ubuntu, I contacted Ubuntu MOTU as an upstream author to help maintaining my packages. I wanted the best possible user experience on Ubuntu. As all my programs are 100% Python, they asked me to do the maintaince with the Debian PAPT (Package APplication Team) and sync it from there to Ubuntu.

===== SPE =====

I'm the author of SPE (Stani's Python Editor), which is a free Python IDE with code completion, syntax coloring, code folding and visual debugger (WinPdb), UML diagrams, GUI designers (wxGlade and XRCed). Special is it Blenders support. I am co-maintaining the package in Debian (and as such in Ubuntu Universe) with Debian PAPT. SPE is used in schools and universities, even in Edubuntu labs. SPE was reviewed as the best free, open source python editor at PyCon: "<nowiki>[[http://spyced.blogspot.com/2006/02/pycon-python-ide-review.html|As noted previously, SPE is the only really free choice left.]]</nowiki>"

===== Phatch =====

I'm the author of Phatch, which is a PHoto bATCH processor with a user friendly GUI. It makes photo manipulation easy for newbies and fast for experts. "Typical actions include resizing, rotating, cropping, converting, applying shadows, rounded corners, perspective, reflection and converting between different image formats.[1] Phatch can also be used to rename or copy image files based on the exif or IPTC Information Interchange Model tags." (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phatch). I am co-maintaining the package in Debian (and as such in Ubuntu Universe) with Debian PAPT. All Dutch translations are done by me. The development of Phatch started on the international ubuntu forums and quickly become one of the longer threads:

http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=466598

Phatch has been reviewed both online as offline (printed Linux magazines such as <nowiki>[[http://lpmagazine.org/prt/view/actualites/issue/1022.html|Linux+ magazine]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[http://www.ed-diamond.com/feuille_lpra50/index.html|Linux Pratique]]</nowiki>).

<nowiki>[[http://lpmagazine.org/prt/view/actualites/issue/1022.html|{{http://lpmagazine.org//files/linuxplus/Cover/linux_DVD_maj_FR_2.png}}]]</nowiki>

===== SDXF =====

I'm the author of SDXF (Stani's DXF library), which enables to write DXF files in pure python. DXF stands for Drawing eXchange Format for CAD applications. As such it is very important for interoperability between free software applications and industry standards such as AutoCAD. SDXF is used by major free 3D applications such as Blender and FreeCAD for their DXF support.

===== AR =====

I'm the author of AR, which is an ARchitecture Python library for Blender. It is in early stages of development but already has some nice features: AutoCAD DWG support for Blender, bQuery (jQuery based api to select and manipulate elements in Blender), property inspector and Cairo (2d vector) drawing inside Blender. The library comes with unit tests and full <nowiki>[[http://ar.stani.be|documentation]]</nowiki>.

==== Packaging ====

===== sK1 =====

I provide packages in my PPA repository for sK1, a vector graphics application. There were only Mandriva packages available for it. I'm working together with Vladimir Osintsev in the Debian PAPT team to package it for Debian and from there sync it to Ubuntu.

===== Task Coach =====

I've invited Frank Niessink, the author of Task Coach, at my house and showed him how to package his application properly for Ubuntu. Until than he was using the alien method, which was problematic for end users.

==== Community ====

===== Ubuntu Release Parties =====

In the Belgian/Dutch release parties I try to help as much as I can. I assist people installing Ubuntu on their machines. I organised a small release party for Gutsy at my house in Amsterdam. For the Hardy release parties I gave a presentation about Phatch, both in Belgium and the Netherlands. For the Dutch release party I also helped to arrange speakers. For an Intrepid release party I held a presentation about my free software coin. For the Belgian release party, I filmed all the presentations, transcoded them to ogg videos and made them available online:

===== Forums =====

From time to time I help users on the international, dutch and belgian forums, especially with graphics software and with Python. I was chosen as <nowiki>[[http://prikbord.ubuntu-nl.org/blog/2008/07/01/ubuntero-van-de-maand-juli-stani/|Ubuntero of the Month]]</nowiki> of the Dutch/Belgian forum in July 2008.

===== CD distribution =====

I live right in the center of Amsterdam and have received many requests for Ubuntu CD's. I have distributed hundreds of CDs, of which a lot of them I burnt myself. Some people are individuals, but I've also given to schools. With every release I request 10 CDs from shipit, which are gone very fast. Sometimes I try to get a box at a release party, as many people prefer officially printed CDs.

===== Artwork =====

I created the theme "Uborange", which is a glossy orange theme with rounded buttons and striped bars. It uses the murrine engine, but also the clearlooks engine. It blends well with the human icons of Ubuntu:

===== Conferences =====

I give presentations at various conferences such as Libre Graphics Meeting, local and international Python community meetings (such as Europython). Often in these presentations I advocate Ubuntu. Of course they are always done from my Ubuntu laptop, which give more visibility to Ubuntu. I'm also invited to speak at the <nowiki>[[http://2009.rmll.info|Rencontres Mondiales du Logiciel Libre]]</nowiki> 2009 in Nantes (France).

===== Ubuntu Open Week =====

Together with Pochu I organized a <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MeetingLogs/openweekhardy/PythonPackaging|session]]</nowiki> about packaging python programs for Ubuntu. I announced this session within various python communities (such as python-announce, wxpython, ...) This resulted in a manual on the Ubuntu wiki how to package Python applications:

https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PackagingGuide/Python

===== Blog =====

On my blog I am very explicit about my use of Ubuntu, both by the blog posts and by for example displaying the count down timer to the new releases. My blog is aggregated on Planet Python, Planet Blender, Planet Graphics, Planet Ubuntu-BE and Planet Ubuntu-NL.

===== Reporting bugs =====

As an developer myself, I know the importance of high quality bug reports. Therefore I try to file good bug reports whenever I encounter bugs. I reported for example the first bug against Ubuntu Netbook Remix.

===== Wiki =====

* I've started writing https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopment/Abbreviations, which has now been merged into https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuWeeklyNewsletter/glossary

===== Ubuntu in the Dutch government =====

Some time ago there was an initiative to use Linux in the Dutch government. They were not considering Ubuntu, as they thought there was not commercial support available. I explained them that Canonical offered commercial support for Ubuntu and kindly asked them to reconsider Ubuntu. At the same time I've put Canonical in touch with the right contacts. Canonical thanked me for getting them involved, as the talks turned out successful.

===== Fablab =====

Fablabs are all about open hardware (not just computers), which is the nice counterpart of free software. A FabLab is a workspace that contains four modern prototyping machines. The Fablab has developed into a global network of standardized open hardware setups. People from all over the world are using it to create and develop their own ideas and solutions in wood, metal, plastic, ... In the local fablab in Amsterdam they use Ubuntu, sometimes called Fabuntu. I provide them with Ubuntu support.

===== Helping to switch =====

I've helped many friends and family to switch to Ubuntu. My speciality is helping out architects and visual artists.

===== Free software coin =====

I won a national competition for designing a new Dutch coin by only using free software. It was my statement to show that as a designer or visual artist you are not dependent on proprietary software as is often claimed by the industry. The coin was released on October 30, the same day as Ubuntu Intrepid Ibex was released (not by accident). My following blog post about "How to make money with free software", which included some free Ubuntu publicity, got <nowiki>[[http://tech.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/10/30/2138259|slashdotted]]</nowiki> and referenced all over the web, also far outside the free software community (especially in the design, typography and numismatic world). In this blog post I described how I won a competition for designing a new coin with only free software (cairo, gimp & inkscape) and explicitly mentioned Ubuntu. I also published it in the Full Circle Magazine of the Ubuntu community. I was interviewed for the French national television (FR3) about the coin, on which occasion I was wearing an Ubuntu t-shirt ;-)

=== Future plans ===

As an author of several upstream packages, I feel first the responsibility to further develop and maintain these packages. For example now I am preparing a new release of Phatch, together with the first new co-developer. I've been asked by <nowiki>[[http://sk1project.org/modules.php?name=Products&product=uniconvertor|uniconvertor]]</nowiki> (which handles all vector conversions for programs such as Inkscape and Sk1) to add sdxf support and I will be glad to do it. As a result of the latest LGM, I'm working on a proof of concept which will help the open font library to filter out proprietary fonts with a fingerprint algorithm. I will continue with all my activities and advocate free software both inside and outside the community (for example in the architecture and art world).

=== Testimonials ===
==== Emilio Pozuelo Monfort ====
It was about time! Stani rocks, he doesn't only do a great job as an upstream developer for the free software community, but he also cares about his packages in Ubuntu and Debian. I co-maintain phatch and spe in Debian PAPT with him and can only say good things about him. He also invited me to the Netherlands (and I'll go some day)! So full ACK from me!

==== Wesley Stessens ====
I've met Stani a few times. He's a good and creative guy. He does great things for Ubuntu; especially his work on SPE and Phatch.

==== Bart Broeckx ====
I know Stani very well, he's an active member of the Ubuntu-nl and Ubuntu-be community. He gave presentations on several Ubuntu Release Parties in Belgium and the Netherlands. As an active developer and artist he has a very clear view on how software should be. I would like to give my full support to Stani to become an Ubuntu-member. 

==== Steve Alexander ====
I've been impressed by Stani's contributions to Ubuntu release events in the Netherlands, of packaging SPE and Phatch for Ubuntu and showing others how to use Launchpad effectively to track Ubuntu bugs and do translations.  Stani has demonstrated and promoted Ubuntu as a part of promotions for his art and architecture activities, and promoted Ubuntu at Python user groups throughout the Netherlands.  Stani has also promoted the adoption of Ubuntu by departments within the Dutch government.  While I am not an Ubuntu member, I have been involved in Ubuntu since the very start.  On this basis, I support Stani's application for Ubuntu membership.

==== Mark Van den Borre ====
+1

==== ScottKitterman ====

Where Stani says, "they [MOTU] asked me to do the maintaince with the Debian PAPT (Package Aplication Pakcaging Team) and sync it from there to Ubuntu." above, that was me.  The amount of packaging work that Stani is doing for Ubuntu is somewhat masked by the fact that most of it is in Debian PAPT.  I encouraged (perhaps even insisted) he do it that was so that both distros could benefit from his work.  This has been good both for Debian and Ubuntu.  He has also helped on Ubuntu packages directly when timing made working through Debian inappropriate.  I also recall him volunteering to contact other upstream developers that he knew to help get bugs resolved in Ubuntu.  I'd be recommending a +1 just for his packaging work.  Given the breadth of his involvement in various aspects of Ubuntu, definitely should be a member.

==== MikeRooney ====
Stani has done awesome work in SPE and its Ubuntu support, as well as plenty of wxPython contributions. I was also very impressed with his winning coin design, made entirely using free software. Stani is a very excellent FLOSS contributor and developer and Ubuntu would be quite lucky to have him as a member!

==== Igor Novikov ====
Stani has provided deb packages for our sK1 editor. It's really useful issue for Ubuntu and Debian users. Also he helps us to submit sK1 package into official Debian repository and I hope this job will be successful! 

==== Alberto Milone ====
I'm a big fan of SPE and when I found issues about it in the past, Stani was very responsive on launchpad and via email. I can confirm that he's both a great upstream and a fantastic contributor to Ubuntu. A big +1 from me.

==== Joey Stanford ====

+1

==== leoquant ====

==== MagicFab ====

I only marginally have seen Stani's work and I am impressed at his level of commitment to maintain and fix packages in Ubuntu. I use phatch regularly and in a few recent bugs affecting other applications by way of phatch, I got offered a custom package to test :) I wish Stani has many friends with similar attitude and availability! So big +1 from me too. -- FabianRodriguez
