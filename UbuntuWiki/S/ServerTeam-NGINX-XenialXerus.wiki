=== NGINX in Xenial Xerus ===

(The following information was obtained from <nowiki>[[XenialXerus-ReleaseNotes#Nginx|the Xenial Xerus Release Notes for NGINX]]</nowiki>)

Ubuntu 16.04 includes version 1.9.15 of the Nginx web server, with an expectation to provide the next stable release of Nginx, 1.10.0, as an SRU after release (which will be virtually identical to 1.9.15). This version of Nginx also includes HTTP/2 support, which supersedes SPDY support previously provided in the Nginx packages.
