=== Summary ===

This spec is to track amd discuss community proposed blueprints and changes for the Lubuntu desktop for Lucid.  These changes involve principally adding a new (and separate) Lubuntu artwork package, creating a package for lxdm to use in place of gdm, and seed changes including support for building a live cd from the Lubuntu seed.  These are represented as:

* https://blueprints.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/lubuntu-lucid-artwork
* https://blueprints.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/lubuntu-lucid-default-applications
* https://blueprints.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/lubuntu-lucid-packaging-policy

=== Release Note ===

With the introduction of Lucid, a more complete release of the LXDE desktop for Ubuntu (Lubuntu) is being made available.  This release includes the LXDE desktop manager (lxdm), and new artwork.

=== Rationale ===

This spec is mostly to consolidate what is three community specifications, so they can be discussed as a single effort at UDS.  Historically LXDE was supported in part through the mobile team, and we are using this to continue some tangible effort at continuing to offer some guidance to the emergence of a very lightweight community driven Ubuntu derivative.
