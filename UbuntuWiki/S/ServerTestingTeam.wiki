The ServerTestingTeam tries to get <nowiki>[[ServerTeam|Ubuntu Server]]</nowiki> working on as much server hardware as possible.

== How can I help ? ==

We try to test every milestone released during the development cycle. We're also interested in results for <nowiki>[[LTS]]</nowiki> releases and the last stable release. 

So if you have some server hardware available you can download one of the iso listed above, run a default installation and report your test results on this page.

==== Choose an image to test ====

Here is a list of releases requiring testing:
** <nowiki>[[http://releases.ubuntu.com/dapper/|LTS DapperDrake 6.06.2]]</nowiki>
** <nowiki>[[http://releases.ubuntu.com/gutsy/|Gutsy Gibbons 7.10]]</nowiki>
** <nowiki>[[http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/hardy/alpha-5/|LTS HardyHeron Alpha 5]]</nowiki>

Download one of the ubuntu-server iso.

==== Running tests ====

You can find the list of tests on ServerTestingResultsTemplate. We want to make sure that the hardware is supported by the kernel and that a default installation from the ubuntu-server cd is successful. The ServerTestingProcedure has a list of questions that can be used during a test run.

==== Reporting results ====

To report your results, check if your model is <nowiki>[[#testedmodels|already listed]]</nowiki>. If so, go to the model sub-page and add a new test result. Otherwise, <nowiki>[[#addnewmodel|add a new model]]</nowiki> and your test results.

==== Filing bugs ====

If some of the test fails, don't forget to report the bug in launchpad ! Otherwise, the chances to get things fixed are really low. 

When reporting bugs specify which iso you've tested (eg: hardy-server-amd64 alpha 4) and attach the output of at least <code>dmesg</code> and <code>lspci -vvn</code> as well as any other output relevant to the bug:

<code>lspci -vvn</code>

<code>dmesg</code>

== List of tested hardware ==

==== Adding a new model ====

Create a new model page using the following naming scheme: Manufacturer''''''Model''''''Number.

Examples: 
* Dell''''''Power''''''Edge650
* IBMx''''''Series''''''346

==== List of tested models ====

== How to contact us ? ==

There are some results that need to be migrated to the new website structure.
