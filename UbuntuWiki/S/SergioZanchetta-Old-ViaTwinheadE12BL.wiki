==== Notes ====
Thread about wireless radio on/off button: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=241938

Apparently the button is supported by the rt2x00 driver, but I haven't tried it: http://rt2x00.serialmonkey.com 

Video is pretty jaggy with the autodetected "vesa" driver. Also, the included "via" driver doesn't work (it makes the screen go blank). The Openchrome binaries here work very well though, and enable smooth video as well as direct rendering and screen blanking (though the screen blank Fn key is still not recognized): http://gamesplace.info/opensource/openchrome/dapper-binaries/
