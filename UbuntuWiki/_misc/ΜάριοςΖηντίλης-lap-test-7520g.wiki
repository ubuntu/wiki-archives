=== Current Issues ===

In Normal Graphics Mode, the option "Try Ubuntu without any change to your computer" results to the monitor going totally off -not black- and the cd is spinning as if normally booting Ubuntu, which apparently is what happens in the background. In the end everything stops and the monitor is still black, with nothing left to do but hit the power button once, wait a few seconds for Ubuntu to automatically eject the cd, and press Enter to continue with shutdown, as at this point I suspect that it would normally display the message: "Please remove the cd from the drive and press Enter to shutdown" or something similar.

By pressing F4 and selecting "Safe graphics mode" and then selecting "Try Ubuntu without any change to your computer", the monitor again goes off and the cd spins while loading Ubuntu, but after a few seconds the GUI eventually comes up in 800x600 resolution. Then it is possible to install.
