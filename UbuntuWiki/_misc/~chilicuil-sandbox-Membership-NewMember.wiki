We look for sustained and significant contributions. While there is no precise period that we look for, it is rare for applications to be accepted from people contributing for less than '''6 months'''. If you are unsure if your contributions constitute as sustained and significant, ask your team mates and other Ubuntu members. Maybe they can even add some kind of endorsement to your application.

== Normal Procedure ==

The regular way to apply for membership is through the <nowiki>[[~chilicuil-sandbox-Membership-Boards|Membership Boards]]</nowiki>. Alternatively some Ubuntu teams can grant membership directly through their governance Council. Examples are the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~kubuntu-members|Kubuntu Council]]</nowiki>, the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~edubuntu-members|Edubuntu Council]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[DeveloperMembershipBoard|Developer Membership Board]]</nowiki>, and the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-irc-council|IRC Council]]</nowiki>.

In each case, you need to add your name to the agenda for the next meeting of the membership board that suits your time zone, or the team council, and prepare carefully according to the instructions below.

The membership boards hold meetings at <nowiki>[[~chilicuil-sandbox-Membership-Boards#A12:00|12:00 UTC]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[~chilicuil-sandbox-Membership-Boards#A22:00|22:00 UTC]]</nowiki>.

=== Other venues for obtaining Membership ===

In addition to the <nowiki>[[~chilicuil-sandbox-Membership-Boards|Membership Boards]]</nowiki>, who handle the bulk of membership approval, there are other groups in Ubuntu that handle specific other cases.

If your primary contributions to Ubuntu are:
** Edubuntu, you might want to add your application to the <nowiki>[[Edubuntu-Council]]</nowiki> agenda and attend a meeting there
** Kubuntu, you might want to add your application to the <nowiki>[[Kubuntu-Meetings]]</nowiki> agenda and attend a meeting there
** very technical (Ubuntu development, packaging and the like), you might want to follow the <nowiki>[[UbuntuDevelopers]]</nowiki> process
** For contributions that are mostly within the IRC area, you might want to add your application to <nowiki>[[IRC-IrcCouncil-MeetingAgenda]]</nowiki> and attend a meeting there. More information on the specific process at: <nowiki>[[IRC-Membership]]</nowiki>
** For contributions primarily related to providing support via the Ubuntu forums, you can apply via <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Forums/Membership|Forums Membership]]</nowiki> . 

== Preparing your Application ==

It is vital to be well prepared for the meeting. You need to convince the membership board that you have contributed to Ubuntu.

=== Personal wiki page ===

Your contributions should therefore be carefully documented on your personal wiki page. Include the following details:

# A summary of your contributions to Ubuntu (no longer than 2-3 lines per item)
# A link to your Launchpad profile
# A complete description of your contributions to Ubuntu
# Your plans and ideas for Ubuntu in the near and far future

You can use <nowiki>[[MembershipTemplate|this template]]</nowiki> as a sample.

=== Code of Conduct ===

You must have signed the Code of Conduct (see the GnuPrivacyGuardHowto for more info on this), '''prior''' to applying for membership.

=== Testimonials ===

If there are recognized members of the Ubuntu community supporting you at the meeting, this will definitely speed up the process of approving you. If your “sponsors” can’t attend the relevant meeting, ask them to leave a testimonial on your wiki page about your contributions.

'''Note''': They do not need to be Ubuntu Members, just a part of the community, even your local community.  Testimonials in languages other than English are fine.  Some members of boards are multilingual, and if not, they can use a translation tool.

=== Agenda ===

Add your wiki page with at least 24 hrs ahead of the meeting to the Board best suited for your time.

* <nowiki>[[~chilicuil-sandbox-Membership-Boards#A12:00|12:00 UTC Board]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[~chilicuil-sandbox-Membership-Boards#A22:00|22:00 UTC Board]]</nowiki>

Try to follow these suggestions when possible:

* Your personal wiki page should be prepared before you add your application to the agenda
* Be well prepared for the interview
** It's a good practice to create a writing where you describe yourself and your contributions to Ubuntu before hand.
* Add yourself to the list early, the board meetings usually take about an hour and if there are many applicants some may get postponed until the next meeting
* Add your wiki page to the meeting agenda at least '''24 hours''' ahead of the meeting
* '''Only''' add yourself when you're sure you can make it to the next meeting
* The date at the end of the agenda table is the date you have added yourself to the membership candidate list, '''not''' the date of a meeting.
* Candidates will '''not''' be considered if they have not <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SigningCodeofConduct|Digitally Signed]]</nowiki> the Ubuntu Code of Conduct.'''
