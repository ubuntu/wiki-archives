__TOC__

My name is James.
Nick: pangloss on #ubuntu-motu

I live in New Jersey in the United States and English is my native language.

I am 22 years old and will be graduating in May of 2009 with a B.E. in
Computer Engineering, and a masters in Computer Science. I have been using 
Linux since I came to college in 2004 and have tried every distribution I have 
gotten my hands on. Ubuntu is my favorite.
I am fairly competent with C, C++, Java, Python, and
some hardware description languages such as VHDL. I am familiar with
bash and vim.
I am interested in systems level tools and programs, as well as
network related tools (wired and wireless). I also enjoy virtual box
(neat toy to show your friends).

Software I use every day: firefox, virtualbox, xilinx, openoffice, vi,
bash (yes thats software too), irc, gimp, bluefish
Software I actively contribute to: none
Software I wrote and look forward to packaging: none yet ;-)

I did my first patch yesterday (25-Oct-2008) on friendly-recovery and the debdiff is awaiting 
sponsorship or approval.
