You've landed on André Lucas' Ubuntu wiki homepage. Hello.

== About ==

I work as a systems administrator for the most part, with a bit of programming. I know a good amount about email, DNS and the UNIX network tools in general. I've done quite a lot of Perl, C and shell, but Python is my current favourite scripting language.

I live in England, so my timezone is UTC+0.

== Current projects ==

Currently in the alpha program for BugSquad.

== Interests ==

I'm interested in networking tools, especially DNS and mail, but I also want to get a more thorough understanding of how Ubuntu fits together.

== Previous projects ==

A long time ago I wrote some code for portable OpenSSH, back in the early days. To my amazement it's still there, and it's found its way into Dropbear (and maybe others) as well. I've written just enough OpenSSL code to know that it isn't any fun. I wrote a flow control module for Qpsmtpd (in Perl, of course), which taught me that (a) I don't really like Perl OO that much, and (b) C would have been a better choice.
