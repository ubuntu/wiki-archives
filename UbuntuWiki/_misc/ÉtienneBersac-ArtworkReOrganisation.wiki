__TOC__


After the mess of ArtworkTeam for DapperDrake, the team requires a deep reorganisation -- especially for its wiki. Here are a collection of reviews and propositions submitted for this reorganisation.

== Pre Dapper Artwork Wiki State ==

Artwork Wiki was divided into two namespaces : <nowiki>[[Artwork]]</nowiki> and ArtworkTeam. During Dapper-Edgy inter cycle time, ArtworkTeam did a lot of work on its wiki namepsace.

== Proposition ==

=== Migrate ArtworkTeam To Artwork ===

* Gather <nowiki>[[Artwork]]</nowiki> and ArtworkTeam into <nowiki>[[Artwork]]</nowiki>.
** Agree -- Troy
* Rename ArtworkTeam/People to <nowiki>[[Artwork/Team]]</nowiki>.
** Agree -- Troy
* Move Meetings to <nowiki>[[Artwork/Team]]</nowiki>.
** Agree.  I think this whole meeting thing needs to be streamlined.  Some place for someone new to locate and get up to speed with exactly where we are in the development doc timeline, what needs direct attention, etc.  One page.  Clean and simple.  IRC meetings are sort of useless if we are all in different time zones etc. -- Troy
* Gather Meetings résumé in <nowiki>[[Artwork/Team/Meetings/]]</nowiki>
** See above.  I really am not a huge fan of the whole IRC thing.  It is darn limiting. -- Troy
* Move Agenda in <nowiki>[[Artwork/Team/Meetings]]</nowiki>.
** As above. -- Troy
* Create a GetInvolved page, maybe in <nowiki>[[Artwork/Team/]]</nowiki> or just put it on <nowiki>[[Artwork]]</nowiki> !
** This is '''important'''.  We need a CLEAN and EASY way to show how to contact us, get involved, and pick up the workload. Sublinks to howto IRC, howto MailingList, howto Launchpad. -- Troy
* Create WartyWartHog, HoaryHedgeHog, BreezyBadger, DapperDrake and EdgyEft that contain reviews for released version and drafts for current development version.
** If this is purely graphical, absolutely.  I think it is a nice way to reference existing pieces.  Not a high priority as it takes time and is largely more referential. -- Troy
** I suggest to creates Review of reviews artwork in <nowiki>[[Artwork/Reviews]]</nowiki> for each released version. For the current version, we need more than one page. So i suggest to create <nowiki>[[Artwork/Current/]]</nowiki> namespace to contains Targets, GuideLines, Drafts and other stuffs current release, before building a Review of it when release -- ÉtienneBersac
* Move Documentation on top of <nowiki>[[Artwork/]]</nowiki>
** Disagree.  Some documentation belongs below us and is specifically related to us.  -- Troy
* Drop non <nowiki>[[Artwork]]</nowiki> Howtos, e.g. IRC Howto must be a standalone page : IRCHowto or XChatHowto or GaimHowto.
** Agree as per above getting involved.  -- Troy
* Put Drafts and Proposition into <nowiki>[[Artwork/Incoming]]</nowiki>
** Agree!  One place for ALL incoming additions! Love this idea.  -- Troy
* Create <nowiki>[[Artwork/Evaluations]]</nowiki> for us to compare Propositions. That might be <nowiki>[[Artwork/Team]]</nowiki> only.
** Possible disagree.  I will work on getting the CMS admin off of Henrik for this.  A CMS is better for collecting all the bits as it can't be defaced, etc. -- Troy
* Make a beautiful template. ArtworkTeam/PageTemplate is quite good.
** Agree! We so badly need this.  -- Troy

=== The Artwork Main Page ===

Here is an outline of what we should provide in our main page.

* Ubuntu Artwork Goals : Be Different (not Think Different ;) )
** More specifically -- what we are currently working on.  Where we are currently at regarding development document timeline.  How to participate.  Etc. -- Troy.
* Presenting the ArtworkTeam. Our brand new logo : {{http://librarian.launchpad.net/2980250/Emblem-16.png}}
** Matters not really.  More about how a newcomer can get on the log and help it roll along. -- Troy.
* Getting Involved directives. Artwork Wiki Guidelines : Put new stuffs in <nowiki>[[Artwork/Incoming]]</nowiki> using <nowiki>[[Artwork/PageTemplate]]</nowiki>
** Exactly! -- Troy.
* Various Links : other Ubuntu derivative ArtworkTeam, Official artwork, Licensing, etc.
** Perfect!  Howtos for Gimp, Wacom tablet links, Launchpad details, and everything else the participating artist requires in a useful and clean summary format. -- Troy.

=== Artwork NameSpace Tree ===

* Artwork
** Incoming.  Wiki additions, art, etc.
** Documentation drafts.
** Loose ideas. Etc.
** SandBox
** Team.  Details and involvement.  Needs further sorting.
** GetInvolved (detailed version of <nowiki>[[Artwork]]</nowiki> introduction). Maybe merged into parent (aka Team).
** Meetings
** Tasks
** Structure Documents.
** Documentation
** GuideLines 
** Tools
** Licensing
** Archives (Just a artwork review like ArtworkTeam/Themes/DapperHuman ).
** WartyWarthog

** BreezyBadger
** DapperDrake

== Depreciated ==
** Current - possibly obsolete
** Targets - Probably in our structure documentation in /Team.
