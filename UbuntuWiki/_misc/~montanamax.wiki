| <nowiki>[[File:head4.png]]</nowiki>
| Howdy! I'm Jon "Montana Max" Pruett, a thirty-something (I try to forget) IT program manager based out of Washington, DC. Used to be a Microsoft Web Developer / DBA back in the early 90's, lot's of experience with eCommerce before it had the fancy name. Light commercial architect before that, working on retail strip mall construction plans. Grease monkey in a motorcycle shop for a while, doing light repair stuff and hacking on older Japanese bikes and the occasional 70's Triumph or Guzzi. Can also use a hammer to hit my thumb with amazing force and precision. Huge fan of Heinlein, but haven't had occasion to deliver a baby or conn a ship yet.

== My Interest in Ubuntu ==

I've been a big fan of the FOSS concept since I did a research paper in college. I've tried several Linux distro's since then, and Ubuntu has become my favorite. It's proven to be a great product with a very supportive community. 

I'm currently running <nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/IconKubuntuCircle.png]]</nowiki> Kubuntu 8.04 on an HP TC1100 tablet and Kubuntu 8.10 on a Shuttle XPC SN68SG2. I've also spent a month or so with Ubuntu 8.04 and Xubuntu 8.04 betas on the same hardware (but I haven't had a success with the 9.04 upgrade yet). Ubuntu has been such a great experience that in a mere four weeks of working with Kubuntu 6.06 I completely wiped my Windows partitions and haven't looked back! Well, except for lusting after my IntelliCAD clone of AutoCAD functionality. Wine has been a frustrating and fruitless experience in every distribution I've tried. The QCAD application is showing promise, but retraining over 10 years of AutoCAD habits is annoying. 

== Open Source Stuff ==

Most of my development experience is with Microsoft technologies, but I'm getting into the world of Open Source oriented languages (Bash scripting, PHP, and Perl at the moment) and dusting off some old LISP skills as well. I've also been focusing some energy on helping the web, documentation, and evangelism sides of the FOSS community too.

==== Ubuntu ====

I'm getting my feet wet in the Ubuntu community, trying to give back to the group that has given me such a sweet operating system and desktop environment. I've been helping the WikiTeam clean up and better categorize all the user generated documentation in the various Ubuntu related wikis.

<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/IconBug.png]]</nowiki> Roaming the WikiToDo lists and looking for things in the Category``Cleanup pile is a great way to learn about Ubuntu. This is something I would recommend to any new Linux user as a great way to become more rounded. I'll be doing more of this as I get more comfortable with creating new documentation in the editing style and content philosophy of the community documentation wiki. So far I'm focusing on porting pages from the w.u.c site to h.u.c/c, cleaning up formatting issues, and condensing the cases of multiple similar pages into one.

==== Wordpress ====

Like many other Linux fans, I've fallen in love with Wordpress. I use it in a "bare bones" capacity on my blog, and I've gone a few steps deeper in a website deployment for a neighborhood garden center <nowiki>[[http://enggc.com]]</nowiki> It seems like every time I have a question or need it's easy to resolve with a simple run through the amazing variety of plugins. On the rare occasion a plugin doesn't do the trick, a quick dive into php or css source is a simple experience in most cases.

In the interest of full disclosure, the senior design credit on the Eclectic Nature site goes to my lovely "better half". I was the junior collaborator for graphical design and image work, but the key resource for all CSS and code implementation. The site came out much stronger for the collaboration too!

==== BookMooch ====

Another "open" project I feel strongly about is <nowiki>[[http://www.BookMooch.com/]]</nowiki> - it's a community for freely sharing books of all types. I always have a few books listed, and shipping overseas is not a problem at all. Books shouldn't sit on shelves all lonely and neglected. When you're done reading, send it to someone - it's a great form of cradle to cradle recycling.

==== KSmoothDock ====

I put together the website and documentation for the K``Smooth``Dock project at <nowiki>[[http://ksmoothdock.sourceforge.net/]]</nowiki> in 2007. With the advent of KDE4 I don't know if KSmoothDock will continue forward into future versions. If it does, I'll be giving the website and documentation an overhaul.

<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/example.png]]</nowiki> I did work up an install guide for Kubuntu 7.04 through 6.06 at <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/KSmoothDock|KSmoothDock]]</nowiki> for those people interested in using some of these older (and very stable) Kubuntu versions.

==== AutoLisp ====

A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away... I used to be a professional draftsman and LISP slinger working in early versions of AutoCAD. Some of my stuff was published in Cadalyst back in 94 and 95. I was particularly proud of a some 3D variable axis scaling algorithms using matrixes that I wrote in R10. These functions started showing up in the base AutoCAD product around R14. It would probably take me weeks to get back to that level of math proficiency now, but it did give me an appreciation for the type of coding that game and graphics programmers deal in every day. Very cool stuff.
