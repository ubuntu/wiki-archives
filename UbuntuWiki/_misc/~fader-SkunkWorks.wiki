=== Other Examples ===

* I was a member of Canonical for several years, during which I created formal testing procedures and documentation for the Ubuntu Certified program.  This also involved managing expectations and communication between the community, Canonical, and hardware vendors.  As a result I have a proven track record of working within the community, respecting NDAs as necessary, and designing, implementing, and managing large-scale testing projects.
