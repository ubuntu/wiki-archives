__TOC__

== Ubuntu 6.04 installation ==
Ubuntu finds hardware and correctly loads the 3ware 9xxx driver.

== After the install ==
Ubuntu correctly sees how much space the 3ware drive offers but cannot enable the drive.

== 3ware's Notes ==
* The 3ware.com page shows no support for Ubuntu.
* <nowiki>[[http://www.3ware.com/kb/article.aspx?id=12690|Here's how to compile]]</nowiki> the 3ware driver into the kernel straight from 3ware.com.

== Update Edgy ==
The problem persists into Edgy for at least some 3ware cards (I've tested 7xxx series cards).  The problem appears to affect 64 bit machines with more than 3G of ram.  Reducing ram to 2G did fix the problem for me.  The problem is supposedly fixed upstream by 3ware, so hopefully fixes will be backported
