__TOC__

==== Drivers ====
* More hardware through modem drivers (new upstream kernel; backport/cherry-pick patches that are likely to enter the upstream tree)
* Devices that provide USB storage need fixed drivers too (patches already in jaunty kernel and some on their way upstream - cherry-pick might be an option here)

==== ModemManager enabled NetworkManager ====
* Better support for driver specific features with modemmanager (e.g. signal strength)
* modems with non-standard AT commands (e.g. f3507g).

==== Connection Stability ====
* new ppp version from upstream (2.4.5 pre from git; look at what other distros ship; coordinate with debian maintainer(s)

==== Bluetooth ====
* at risk: bluetooth support will not be added before network manager 0.8 (not for jaunty)

==== UI/Connection Policies ====
* potential ubuntu contribution: more fine grained control about devices - disable individual devices manually
* build a connection policy service on top of the "fine grained control"
