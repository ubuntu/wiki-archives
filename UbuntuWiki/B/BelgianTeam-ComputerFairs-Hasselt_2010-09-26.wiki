'''Report'''

Setup of the booth:
-----------------------
The setup of the booth went smoothly and the U-shaped arrangement on this fair was simple to achieve. We had 1.5 hours of work to complete the booth.

Hardware used:
--------------------------
2x PC with monitor
1x server monitor
2x netbooks
2x laptops
1x gamepc with monitor and projector
1x 8-port switch
1x wireless access point for wifi "ubuntu-be" for laptops and netbooks

There was much interest in the ordinary PCs and laptops with ubuntu, the netbooks I found had less success. The hype about the netbooks is not a hypy anumore (on this fair anyway).
The (web) server actually had little or no success, this PC next time we simply use as Demo for  (X, K) ubuntu.
What many visitors stopped for was the GamePc from Massimiliano especially when we played Frets on Fire ther were many people watching, so we can also propose ubuntu to a younger audience.

Thanks to Hans for the use of the beamer.

Visitors:
--------------
There was a lot of people between 10.30h and 12.30h in the afternoon it was around 14.00 a bit crowded, the rest it was pretty quiet. So we had some time to resolve  a few bugs in the network that we had build.

CD donations:
---------------------
There where about 40 original CDs distributed and 20 copy's.
The donations were well , after the payment of the booth (20 €) and parking (12 €) we had 54,25€ left.

To Do with the donations:
-----------------------------
Buy Fabric tablecloth
Payment for shipping promotional materials
on the next fair we have to  purchase blank CDs and cd-sleaves

Decision:
----------
It was again a pleasant and successful fair.

Thanks to Massimiliano, Hans and Thijs.
