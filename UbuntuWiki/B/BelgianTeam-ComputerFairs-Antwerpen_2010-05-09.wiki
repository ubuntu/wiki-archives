'''Report'''

Team : Jean7491 (coordination), Bram (coordination), Ivo, Gie, Johanv

The fair was a fairly good event, although the original idea of a 'Launch Party' in the second half of the day, wasn't successful. The booth was located next to the food and drink stand, facing the entrance and very attractive to visitors. We had a new layout, which allowed us to have 2 tables where we could explain and show people how Ubuntu looks like and works, without interrupting the 'traffic'. 2 tables with 2 fixed PC's each (thanks to Alupcs) at the both ends of the booth, and 3 tables in a closed U-shape in the middle, holding a large LCD screen with a continuous presentation, 2 laptops and an Asus Netbook, the flyers and folders, the CD's and a collection pot.

We had enough hardware (3 laptops +spare, a Netbook and 4 rented PC's + 1 'server')
The 'server' (Ubuntu Desktop based machine with the Ubuntu repositories, apache, samba, ...) also ran the presentations on the bigscreen LCD (borrowed)
The repositories copy allowed us to (show how to) install Ubuntu packages, without the need of a (fast) internet conenction.

We distributed approximately 100 CD's, almost all of them were pre-recorded. A couple of requests for 64bit versions, a couple of Server versions and a single Xubuntu CD request were burnt in-place.
We installed Ubuntu on a PC bought in the fair, a lot of people came to see the show (how we did).

A couple of people brought (or bought it at the fair at another booth) a USB stick, which we either copied the iso files they wanted onto, or prepared into a 'USB installation stick'.

Finance :

- total of public gifts = 174,35 euros,

- charges : booth-fee (50 euros), blanco CD's (20 euros)

- benefit : 104,35 euros for Ubuntu-be.

Lessons learned for next events : 
** importance of an improved decoration and new lay-out of the booth, for an easier contact with the public, 

** it is worthy to ask Dipro a booth along a wall, and if possible close to the entrance and/or the food and drink facilities, 

** it is easy to add posters and flyers at the entrance of the event to inform and attract the visitors to the booth,

** it is useful to prepare a memento for participants to the booth with information about ressources (hardware, software and files) and passwords. 

'''Summary''' : a successful event, but the 'Launch Party' concept doesn't fit into the Dipro Computer fair.
