'''Report'''

  It was nice! I (woutervddn) had a great time. As always, it was noticable that Dipro fairs keep getting less and less people. But the photo- and record-fair at the same time helps to attract people. I was quite amazed when I saw how big Noël his personal EventBox is! William took a few pictures which are beneath.

  There were a couple of people who we gave an ubuntu-cd last event (in hasselt or genk). Some liked Unity, and other (as always) hated it. We installed GnomeShell on one of the computers out of the Limburg EventBox and Noël ran a live Kubuntu instance on his laptop. That way we could show the alternatives to people. (We had a couple of Kubuntu CD's and some people asked the difference between the 2, a running instance tells more than just a picture of KDE).

  Also we noticed that our Ubuntu-server CD's, we had Ubuntu, Ubuntu-server and Kubuntu CD's lined up next to each other, ran out quickly. Some people just take every free thing they can grab hold of. Others just didn't read the fact that the front of the CD states: SERVER. Anyhow, they'll notice! Although next event we put a card saying: "WARNING: Server CD Alert" on top of the CD's from the start of the fair...

On a sidenote: We found out William likes to laugh with people who drive smaller cars than him. I do feel obligated to tell you all he drives a car the size of tank...
