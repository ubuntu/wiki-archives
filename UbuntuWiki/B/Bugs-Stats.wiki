==== Bug stats and report feature requests ====

 ''Please add stat or graph feature requests to this list, and file requests in Launchpad as appropriate.''

* Allow dynamic generation of graphs using custom input
** this might be hard given the length of time it takes for queries to run
* Use unique URLs that can be used in IRC and email discussions
** each image is a unique url at this point in time
* More sensible scaling - the line often goes to the very edge of the graph and on short time intervals you can be a big spike for little activity. A minimum of 10 bugs on the Y axis and a buffer of Y-range/20 would be good.

==== Implemented feature requests ====

* DONE - Show graphs for more LP states (incl. Incomplete, Fix Released)
* DONE - Show graphs filtered by LP importance
* DONE - Not having 0 values when unable to connect to Launchpad
* DONE - Moving all bug stat collection from Brian's computer to the data center
* DONE - Being able to graph in the data center, requires gnuplot, instead of Brian's system
