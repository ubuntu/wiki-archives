=== Areas of work ===
I mainly work on merges and syncs and updating packages and fixing FTBFS. Especially I m interested in Science packages (Electronics to be precise) and as a part of the MOTU science team as a long standing contributor (https://edge.launchpad.net/~motuscience/+members#active) and I maintain few packages in debian Major notable things are:

maintaining mobile-broadband-provider-info in debian from close to a year where I forward bugs upstream according to their relevance and do a git pull twice a month and update the package in debian and due to its integration with NM now the popcon of the package has risen almost exponentially 

(http://qa.debian.org/popcon.php?package=mobile-broadband-provider-info)

Copied emu8051 from ubuntu and almost repackaged it completely with packaging improvements to 
comply with modern standards 

http://packages.qa.debian.org/e/emu8051/news/20100617T184717Z.html

Serving on board of pkg-electronics as a senior packager/developer

https://alioth.debian.org/users/bhavi-guest

Has been on the sponsors team actively sponsoring packages as and when I find time

My <nowiki>[[http://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=Bhavani Shankar|Debian QA Page]]</nowiki>

=== My Vision for the ARB ===

'' ubuntu-revu as of now according to me seems somewhat less transparent to especially new guys who want to get their package into ubuntu as compared to debian-mentors where packagers put the links to their packages from mentors.debian.net on debian mentors mailing list and DD's give a generally quick response thereby packagers feel impressed and pushed even more to get their package into debian. So my main aim in the ARB would be to have a considerably quick response and turnaround time from reviewing the perspective package to getting the package into the repos which would inturn motivate contributors and developers to get their apps into ubuntu fora with high level of quality ensured   ''

== Endorsements ==
''If you'd like to endorse, but are not the applicant, do it here. Don't forget to sign with `@``SIG``@`.''

The majority of my work with Bhavani was before he became a MOTU. His work was all of high quality, and I happily endorsed his MOTU application. Since then he has continued to be an active MOTU, although rarely on IRC these days, and has sponsored quite a few uploads for new developers. I often see comments from Bhavani on things in the sponsorship queue. I'm sure Bhavani has the necessary skills to serve on the ARB, and I support his application. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:stefanor]]</nowiki>
