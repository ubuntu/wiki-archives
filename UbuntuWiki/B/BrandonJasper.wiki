'''__Dates and events__'''

'''20OCT05''' Installed Ubuntu on my Mini Mac and I'm quite happy with it. It replaced Fedora 4 and looks to soon replace Fedora 4 on my desktop as well.

'''05NOV05''' Ubuntu 5.10 installed on my AMD64 X2 desktop.  Recompiled a custom kernel and the system is working great.

'''15NOV05''' Joined Kitsap Peninsula Linux User Group http://www.kplug.org .  Ubuntu was chosen for the upcoming install fest.  Ordered pressed CD package to support.

'''16NOV05''' Finally got around to backing up all the important data off my workstations two ntfs harddrives.  Wiped the whole thing and reinstalled Ubuntu, had some LVM problems and can't find anything on the Wiki so a guide is likely in the future.
