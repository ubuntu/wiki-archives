== Team Reporting ==

As the Ubuntu project continues to grow at a ferocious pace, it can often be quite difficult for teams to get an idea of what is going on in different parts of the project. As we continue to grow, it is essential that we know what we are all working on and keep a good level of communication between different parts of the project. This will help us stay abreast of what we are all working on in our different teams, prevent duplication of work and help identify new areas of potential.

To help keep these communication channels open we have developed a simple team reporting procedure. This process will only take a few minutes for each team every month, but will help everyone stay up to date with what is going on.

=== Getting your team ready for reporting ===

To hot-rod your team for reporting, follow these steps:

* Nominate one or more people to overlook the team reporting process for your team.
* You should follow this <nowiki>[[BuildingCommunity-TeamReporting-HowTo|HowTo]]</nowiki> guide to learn how to setup Team Reporting for your team.
* Alternatively, feel free to edit the report page directly and add your report items there.

=== Gathering the reports ===

Gathering the reports is simple. Just follow these steps:

* Send out a few mails to your team to encourage them to put notes of their work on the team report page. The deadline to include your team's report in the monthly Ubuntu Team Reports is the first Sunday of the following Month. For example, January's report is due the first Sunday of February.
* If you are not using the <nowiki>[[BuildingCommunity-TeamReporting-HowTo|new reporting style]]</nowiki>, you will have to take the content from your team's report page and add it to the next month on the <nowiki>[[TeamReports|Team Reports]]</nowiki> page.
