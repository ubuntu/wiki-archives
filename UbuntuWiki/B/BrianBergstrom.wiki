  I have been tinkering with Linux since I was a teenager, contantly trying to figure out how things work.  But I started using it steadily around Ubuntu 7.04 because it was finally much more usable than Windows.  I also like to support open source software, and free ideals in society and politics.  Once I found Ubuntu Studio, I was hooked on Linux audio production and can't go back.  Audio software in Windows is just so expensive and limited.  
  I now have a laptop running 64 Studio for live performance that uses a USB MIDI controller/audio interface to trigger samples and play synth in my band.  I have another laptop running 64 Studio 3.0 beta, based off Hardy, which I use for recording and production work.  And I also have a desktop running Ubuntu 9.04 for hosting my files and tinkering around.  I am finally getting comfortable using Linux for almost all my computer tasks, except for gaming.  Didn't think about that when I got an ATI card, but it is getting better as the RadeonHD driver progresses.  
  Anyways, thats enough talk talk about my penguin walk.  If you want to check out the rock n roll band I play in, powered by linux, goto the <nowiki>[[http://www.chosenrobot.com|Chosen Robot]]</nowiki> website.
