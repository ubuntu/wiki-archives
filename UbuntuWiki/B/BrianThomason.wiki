=== About Me ===

'''Name:''' Brian Thomason

'''Location:''' South Atlanta, GA

'''Role:''' Technical Lead for Canonical's ISV Partners

=== Background ===

I began using Linux with Mandrake 7.1 sometime around 1999 or 2000.  I soon switched to Debian Potato and onto Debian Sid shortly thereafter and have been using Debian-based distros ever since.  I worked for Lindows/Linspire., Inc. from 2003-2007 as the Packaging Team lead on the Services Team.  I began working for Canonical in 2007 in a similar role.

=== Ubuntu ===

Some various contributions I've made to Ubuntu:

* Manage all packages in the Canonical Partner Repository.
* Manage all packages in the "For Purchase" section of the Software Center.
* More of my work in the community can be seen on my <nowiki>[[BrianThomason-MOTUApplication|MOTU Application]]</nowiki>
