To be placed under the 'Language and Subject' heading in our <nowiki>[[IRC-Guidelines|guidelines]]</nowiki>

Our offtopic channels are designed to be places where people can be in company of others while talking about subjects that they enjoy.  We realize that many of us enjoy figuring out computer problems, but we respectfully ask that if a conversation is turning into something that you would more likely see in our support channels, that you bring it there instead.  That said, if someone asks you to move your support conversation into one of our support channels, please do so.
