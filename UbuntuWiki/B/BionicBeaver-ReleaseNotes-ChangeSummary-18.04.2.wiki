__TOC__


This is a brief summary of bugs fixed between Ubuntu 18.04.1 and 18.04.2.  '''This summary covers only changes to packages in ''__main__'' and ''__restricted__'', which account for all packages in the officially-supported CD images; there are further changes to various packages in ''universe'' and ''multiverse''.'''  Some of these fixes were by Ubuntu developers directly, while others were by upstream developers and backported to Ubuntu.  For full details, see the individual package changelogs.

In addition to the bugs listed below, this update includes all security updates from the <nowiki>[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/releases/ubuntu-18.04-lts/|Ubuntu Security Notice list]]</nowiki> affecting Ubuntu 18.04 LTS that were released up to and including February 4, 2019.  The last update included was USN-3871-3 (Linux kernel vulnerabilities).

=== Installation bug fixes ===

Updated CD images are provided with this release, including fixes for some installation bugs.  (Many installation problems are hardware-specific; for those, see "Hardware support bugs" below.)

=== Upgrade bug fixes ===

These changes fix upgrade issues, smoothing the way for future upgrades to later releases of Ubuntu.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| ubuntu-release-upgrader
| Bug:1783589
| make sure that snapd is installed before trying to use it.
|-
| ubuntu-release-upgrader
| Bug:1783593
| update the view with information regarding the progress of snaps being installed.
|-
| ubuntu-release-upgrader
| Bug:1783738
| when checking for connectivity to the snap store use C.UTF-8 for the language so error message matching works.
|-
| ubuntu-release-upgrader
| Bug:1785096
| Remove debs from apt's "Dir::Cache::archives" folder after the upgrade has completed successfully.
|-
| ubuntu-release-upgrader
| Bug:1766890
| Upgrade libc6 before other packages to work around trigger issues
|-
| ubuntu-release-upgrader
| Bug:1787668
| DistUpgradeQuirks.py: if ubuntu-desktop or snapd isn't in the package cache don't try and run the quirk for installing or upgrading snaps.
|-
| gnome-initial-setup
| Bug:1781417
| Display the ubuntu welcome wizard in Unity, don't display the "what's new" page though since Unity didn't change
|-
| ubuntu-release-upgrader
| Bug:1787649
| DistUpgradeController.py: If the attempt to only upgrade libc6 ends up creating an issue with apt's problem resolver try the full upgrade. This is what would have happened before the fix for bug 1766890.
|-
| update-manager
| Bug:1317164
| Print transaction error and let the user try again applying updates
|-
| update-manager
| Bug:1791931
| Don't ask backend to do package operations aready done. Aptdaemon cancels the transaction when asked to remove packages already removed which results the failure being shown to the user. This is unnecessary as update-manager can just filter the package operations to be done using a fresh cache and decrease the likelyhood of hitting a race condition where packages to be removed are already removed.
|-
| ubuntu-release-upgrader
| Bug:1797209
| do-release-upgrade: do not run the release upgrade if either not all updates are installed or a reboot is required due to a libc6 upgrade.
|-
| ubuntu-release-upgrader
| Bug:1796940
| debian/control: change ubuntu-release-upgrader-core to depend on ca-certificates
|-
| unattended-upgrades
| Bug:1789637
| Unlock for dpkg operations with apt_pkg.pkgsystem_unlock_inner() when it is available. Also stop running when reacquiring the lock fails. Thanks to Julian Andres Klode for original partial patch
|-
| unattended-upgrades
| Bug:1781586
| Skip rebuilding python-apt in upgrade autopkgtests. Python-apt has a new build dependency making the rebuilding as is failing and the reference handling issue is worked around in unattended-upgrades already.
|-
| unattended-upgrades
| Bug:1785093
| Stop trying when no adjustment could be made and adjust package candidates only to lower versions
|-
| unattended-upgrades
| Bug:1785093
| Skip already adjusted packages from being checked for readjusting. This makes it clearer that the recursion ends and can also be a bit quicker.
|-
| update-manager
| Bug:1072136
| Keep or delete packages after looping over all of them. This prevents the resolver from changing the packages in the loop resulting in not keeping some phased packages back from being upgraded.
|-
| update-manager
| Bug:1795898
| Stop lazy import of InstallBackends. Lazy imports made update-manager crash when an update-manager update changed the backend API and an updated incompatible backend was loaded to the not updated running update-manager process.
|-
| update-manager
| Bug:1790670
| Cancel transaction on exit only when Cancel button is active. Also ignore exception when cancellation fails.
|-
| ubuntu-release-upgrader
| Bug:1799839
| DistUpgrade/DistUpgradeController.py: check all the python symlinks and versions instead of the python one. Thanks to juliank for the assistance.
|-
| ubuntu-release-upgrader
| Bug:1799710
| do-release-upgrade: Do not block release upgrades if the installable updates are ones which are not fully phased.
|-
| update-manager
| Bug:1787553
| Add a reminder to enable Livepatch.
|-
| ubuntu-release-upgrader
| Bug:1797384
| Set icon_name in the dialogs so that there will be an icon in gnome-shell.
|-
| update-notifier
| Bug:1800862
| Check if a Livepatch patch has been applied during boot or before update-notifier has started.
|-
| unattended-upgrades
| Bug:1778219
| Trigger unattended-upgrade-shutdown actions with PrepareForShutdown() Performing upgrades in service's ExecStop did not work when the upgrades involved restarting services because systemd blocked other stop/start actions making maintainer scripts time out and be killed leaving a broken system behind. Running unattended-upgrades.service before shutdown.target as a oneshot service made it run after unmounting filesystems and scheduling services properly on shutdown is a complex problem and adding more services to the mix make it even more fragile. The solution of monitoring PrepareForShutdown() signal from DBus allows Unattended Upgrade to run _before_ the jobs related to shutdown are queued thus package upgrades can safely restart services without risking causing deadlocks or breaking part of the shutdown actions. Also ask running unattended-upgrades to stop when shutdown starts even in InstallOnShutdown mode and refactor most of unattended-upgrade-shutdown to UnattendedUpgradesShutdown class.
|-
| unattended-upgrades
| Bug:1778219
| Increase logind's InhibitDelayMaxSec to 30s. This allows more time for unattended-upgrades to shut down gracefully or even install a few packages in InstallOnShutdown mode, but is still a big step back from the 30 minutes allowed for InstallOnShutdown previously. Users enabling InstallOnShutdown node are advised to increase InhibitDelayMaxSec even further possibly to 30 minutes.
|-
| unattended-upgrades
| Bug:1803749
| Stop using ActionGroups, they interfere with apt.Cache.clear() causing all autoremovable packages to be handled as newly autoremovable ones and be removed by default. Dropping ActionGroup usage does not slow down the most frequent case of not having anything to upgrade and when there are packages to upgrade the gain is small compared to the actual package installation. Also collect autoremovable packages before adjusting candidates because that also changed .is_auto_removable attribute of some of them.
|-
| update-manager
| Bug:1805118
| Do not show the livepatch reminder if update-manager is running on a distribution without software-properties-gtk.
|-
| update-manager
| Bug:1787553
| Add a reminder to enable Livepatch.
|-
| software-properties

| Generate udev rules files to rename devices Due to a systemd issue[1], using link files to rename interfaces doesn't work as expected. Link files will not rename an interface if it was already renamed, and interfaces are renamed in initrd, so set-name will often not work as expected when rebooting. However, rules files will cause a renaming, even if the interface has been renamed in initrd.

Because of that, the _PSV is no longer in use, at least not directly, hence its value may set higher then _CRT. To a fanless system that means no cooling device gets activated before _CRT, so the system will be considered overheated by Linux kernel, and gets shutdown by the kernel.  Upstream fixes:
