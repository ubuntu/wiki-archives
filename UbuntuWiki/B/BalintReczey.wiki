* <nowiki>[[https://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=balint@balintreczey.hu|Packages Overview]]</nowiki>
   I maintain a good set of packages which I collected during the years mostly because they needed some care and at that time I cared about them the most. :-) Some interesting packages are <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/wireshark|Wireshark]]</nowiki> where I'm also part of the upstream Core Dev Team, and <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/kodi|Kodi]]</nowiki> which is a really nice media center for many platforms including Debian and Ubuntu.
