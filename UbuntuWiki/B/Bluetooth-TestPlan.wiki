== Updated Test Plan ==

This wiki page is now quite out of date and has been superseded by this test plan:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ifvm4HkCbbDe3zizSRuIsKUJDgQonhK3jx33lvEjfjg/edit#gid=71448954

== Old Information ==

This page provides a set of tests which can form basic acceptance test for bluetooth in Ubuntu.<<BR>>
We insist that only <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/people/bluetooth|Bluetooth team]]</nowiki> members update this page while normal users should use it as reference while filing bugs.<<BR>>
The page should be updated whenever there is new linux-image or bluez-utils package in repos.

==== Prerequisites: ====
This test plan assumes that bluez-utils package is installed with default configuration and bluetooth services are started. Any additional requirements will be specified when needed.
