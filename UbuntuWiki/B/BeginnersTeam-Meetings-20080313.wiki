== BT Meeting 03/13/08 Minutes ==

 '''Rocket2DMn''' i motion to bring this show to order, we're already late
 
 '''DrSmall''' i second it 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' +1 

 '''LaRoza''' Lawyers do that. Make sure you didn't ask any questions or tell him/her you are a doctor 

 '''ajmorris''' tomaw, out of interest, what did we do? 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' proceed, your 1337ness 

18:18 '''bodhi_zazen''' First, thanks LaRoza for volunteering to do minutes 

 '''Joeb454''' ajmorris, I'd like to know that too 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' thanks LaRoza ! 

 '''Presto124''' nice 

 '''tomaw''' ajmorris: I think you just upset ubotu 

 '''tomaw''' he's a bit touchy towards the end of the week 

 '''st33med''' (knew it) 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' LaRoza, you can post a summary of the discussions / decisions if you like, if you need hlep with the wiki just ask 

 '''ajmorris''' ah, yeah i did 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' what did i tell you guys earlier! 

18:19 '''bodhi_zazen''' First item : 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' wiki : 

 '''st33med''' (drum roll) 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' janquark, you want to start ? 

 18:20 '''janquark''' thats a big topic 

 '''janquark''' where to start? 

 '''Joeb454''' define the purpose of the BT wiki? 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' lol 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' Let me start then 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' janquark, start with https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Beginners/BTMeetings - you said revive the wiki 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' The focus, as you know, is the forums 

 '''DrSmall''' yes, what does the wiki serve as? 

18:21 '''bodhi_zazen''' I envisioned the wiki as a way of identifying and answering FAQ on the forums 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' DrSmall, that is part of the debate :) 

 '''DrSmall''' ... a little slow... 

 '''st33med''' Rules, possibly? 

 '''janquark''' with revive I meant to create a place where beginners could find guides which are written for them, in their "language" 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' FAQ may change week-to-week, but it is usually a few like mounting, gurb, resolution 

 '''ajmorris''' we could use the wiki with a canned response rss feed.... 

18:22 '''bodhi_zazen''' Once team members are familiar with wiki -> have the team help with the main wiki pages 

 '''Joeb454''' heh, gurb, I assume you mean grub...it's becoming less of an issues now anyway 

 '''Joeb454''' that'd be good bodhi :) 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' I did not like the thought of turning an army of raw wiki recruits loose on the wiki, and also wanted the team to become familliar with the wiki as a whole 

 '''DrSmall''' +1 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' i feel that the wiki is a place for us to stay organized, not really post HowTos and help topics. There is already wiki.ubuntu and help.ubuntu for that 

 18:23 '''bodhi_zazen''' Rocket2DMn, that too 

 '''DrSmall''' yes 

 <- Presto123 has disconnected (Connection timed out) 

 '''Presto124''' finally 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' if stuff changes, you can modify entries on help.ubuntu, wiki.ubuntu, and your own HowTos on the forums. We can have a page of links on the wiki to howtos, but i dont think the wiki is the place to keep the howtos themselves 

 Presto124 changes nick to Presto123 

 ChanServ sets user mode +v: Presto123 may now speak if the room is moderated 

18:24 '''bodhi_zazen''' Rocket2DMn, yes and no 

 '''st33med''' Hrm... How about stickying a tip of the week at the top of the beginners forum 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' It is nice to have a section where we can teach team members how to wiki 

 '''Joeb454''' st33med, the top of our forum or abt? 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' bodhi_zazen, perhaps a page that tells users WHERE to find the best help, and then break it down further with subtopics 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' So the way I see it , the beginners wiki servers as : 

 '''Old_Soldier''' well there id a tut forum... with a sticky like that :0 

18:25 '''st33med''' abt 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' 1. Team communication ~ although I am not sure we want to keep team minutes there forever 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' +1 for that 

 '''st33med''' We comunicate fine 

 '''st33med''' what is wrong 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' 2. SHORT FAQ for forums 

 '''janquark''' +1 for that 

 '''DrSmall''' +2 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' +1 if it's very short 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' 3. Training -> launchpad for the team to contribute to the main wikipages 

18:26  <- fedex1993 has disconnected ("Leaving") 

 '''DrSmall''' all that sounds good to me 

 '''st33med''' brb 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' how do you propose doing number 3, bodhi_zazen ? 

 '''Joeb454''' what exactly about launchpad? 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' First step is to identify team members wanting to wiki 

 '''DrSmall''' I can help some 

 '''janquark''' me too 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' Second is to bring them up to speed if they do not know how to wiki 

18:27 '''bodhi_zazen''' Starting with becoming familiar with existing pages 

 '''DrSmall''' i need to do that 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' I do NOT want our team to start 100 + new / duplicate pages 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' for users who want to: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Beginners/Team/FocusGroups 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' Third is to teach them how to wiki, formatting, etc 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' isnt there already a page on wiki.ubuntu or help.ubuntu that explains how to edit wiki pages? 

 '''janquark''' thats true duplicated effort is bad 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' then trun 'em loose 

 '''spiderbatdad''' Rocket2DMn yes 

 '''Joeb454''' sure :) 

18:28 '''st33med''' I am leader of compositing :D 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' lol 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' leading yourself st33med 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' ;) 

 '''st33med''' yes!! 

 '''Joeb454''' bodhi_zazen, what about directing some people here if they want help quick ish) 

 '''DrSmall''' i go minimalistic ;) 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' The forums staff prefers if we communicate on the forums, but I do not think we need post things like minutes from this meeting on the forums. 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' DrSmall, agreed 

18:29 '''bodhi_zazen''' Joeb454, you mean technical support ? 

 '''Joeb454''' yeah 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' I am "OK" with that if you invite and help 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' please do not post this as a support channel on the forums 

 '''st33med''' I don't think we want the channel to overflow like #ubuntu 

18:30 '''bodhi_zazen''' +10 st33med 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' so bodhi_zazen , you are then asking to have this page worked on? - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Beginners/HowtoGetHelp 

 '''Joeb454''' true 

 -> jpatrick has joined ubuntuforums-beginners 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' The other problem with invites is, err team behavior 

 '''st33med''' :p 

 '''Joeb454''' hehe 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' WE will need to watch that we follow th CoC 

 '''DrSmall''' such as? 

 '''DrSmall''' i uplift it 

 '''Joeb454''' you're never in here though 

 '''Old_Soldier''' lol well lets see... 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' bodhi_zazen, perhaps have team members become Ubunteros? 

 '''DrSmall''' me? 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' Rocket2DMn, that is what we need to decide 

 '''Old_Soldier''' we could all take a pledge of silence :0 

 18:31 '''DrSmall''' i am an Ubuntero 

 '''Presto123''' Old_Soldier, i'm almost there :P 

 '''janquark''' me too 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' Well, just be aware that some of the things on this channel that we find funny would offend guests 

 '''Old_Soldier''' just a thought guys 

 18:32 '''Rocket2DMn''' i think the HowToGetHelp page needs to lose all the specifics at the bottom end 

 '''ajmorris''' how about a CK banning whenever there are guests in here? :P 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' last thing we need is to invite someone and then have the channel reported / violation of CoC 

 '''st33med''' no insulting your moms 

 '''Old_Soldier''' when i was a GM we kept our IRC channel clear for just the reason bodhi mentioned 

 '''st33med''' :) 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' and all the pages that ARE howtos/Guides (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Beginners ) need to be ditched 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' I think it is a team effort 

 '''DrSmall''' +1 

 '''DrSmall''' i am for it 

 '''Old_Soldier''' sometimes teamies vent and its not good in front of the customers 

 '''Joeb454''' if we get people in here on an invited basis, we can tell the others that they are a guest and they have <x> problem 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' its all repeat work and is getting outdated anyway 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' everyone be responsible for his/her own behavior and aks folks to tone it down 

 '''st33med''' How about inviting those who have really bad technical problems 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' !ohmy 

 '''ubotu''' Please watch your language and topic to help keep this channel family friendly. 

18:33 '''DrSmall''' ok 

 '''DrSmall''' 10-7! 

 '''Joeb454''' st33med, yeah that's what I'm thinking 

 '''DrSmall''' over and out 

 <- DrSmall has disconnected ("Quit Server - Dr Small's Blog | http://php.8ez.com/drsmall/") 

 '''st33med''' we keeping logs? 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' I think it is good or centrally organize the team, but not necessary lay out guidelines on HOW we deliver help, so long as we are within the bounds of the CoC and common sense 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' CoC are our bounds 

18:34 '''st33med''' CoC? 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' letting us run free, if you will, to help people out gives us room to adapt. a central list of where to find some help documents can be useful, but not necessary 

 '''Presto123''' so no dirty talk? ;'( lol 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' I do not want to discourage the sense of community or rleaxed atmosphere on this channel 

 '''ajmorris''' st33med, im loggin it if needed, but LaRoza is doing the minutes which should be good enough for people like drsmall that miss the rest 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' st33med, Code of Conduct 

 '''st33med''' oh 

 '''spiderbatdad''' corn on cob 

 '''st33med''' yum 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' apt 

 '''Joeb454''' Rocket2DMn, you suggested becoming Ubunteros (I assume you meant on launchpad) 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' Joeb454, yes 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' OK, lets return to wiki 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' ? 

 '''Joeb454''' just for the sake of knowing - how many people in here are Ubunteros? 

 18:35 '''bodhi_zazen''' any further comments on wiki ? 

 '''Joeb454''' oh sorry bodhi :) 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' Joeb454, ask later :) 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' I think the wiki team can have a meetig 

 '''Joeb454''' sure  

 '''Rocket2DMn''' +1 

 '''spiderbatdad''' !ubunteros 

 '''ubotu''' Sorry, I don't know anything about ubunteros - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi 

 '''ajmorris''' Joeb454, i am 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' ie it may be good for the focus groups to have meetings and report back to the general team rather then hashing out ALL wiki details here and now 

 '''janquark''' me too :) 

 '''Joeb454''' if you are, PM me, and I'll add it up 

 '''Presto123''' http://www.ubuntu.com/community/processes/newmember 

 '''Joeb454''' that way we can keep the meeting sort of on topic :) 

18:36 '''Rocket2DMn''' bodhi_zazen, agreed, it is a large task 

 '''Joeb454''' and I can give back a figure later 

 '''Joeb454''' sure 

 '''st33med''' I think that the wiki meeting should be held later 

 '''Joeb454''' I'm always on IRC, so I've put myself down for helping on here I believe 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' I do not want to "require" much of the team as we are volunteers and I do not want there to be barriors 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' do you want somebody to head up the wiki subteam, bodhi_zazen ? or do you want to organize it yourslef 

18:37 '''bodhi_zazen''' Any volunteers to head up the wiki team ? 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' i volunteer, i think janquark might be interested, too 

 janquark me ;) 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' I think nothlit was doing it earlier, but I do not know how active he wants to be 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' OK, we can have two wiki leads 

 '''janquark''' Rocket2DMn and me 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' +1 

 '''st33med''' aye 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' k, ill ttyl about it janquark 

 '''Presto123''' I have not done that much on Wiki, but any way I can help would be cool 

18:38 '''janquark''' fine Rocket2DMn large tasks before us :) 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' brb phonr, continue plz 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' Can you update the wiki focus group, and try to ask nothlit for his input on this as well 

 '''janquark''' sure 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' FYI, I agree with most, if not all, of the comments re: wiki on the meeting page 

 -> Alan_M has joined ubuntuforums-beginners 

 ChanServ sets user mode +v: Alan_M may now speak if the room is moderated 

18:39 '''Joeb454''' bodhi_zazen, referring to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Beginners/Team/FocusGroups are we trying to sort out the focus groups?? 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' back 

 '''Presto123''' Alan_M, :) 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' got it, bodhi_zazen 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' I suggest we learn how to clean up after ourselves, ie contact the wiki group and learn to delete outdated / duplicate wiki pages 

 '''Alan_M''' crap, oh well better late than never 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' Joeb454, yes 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' bodhi_zazen, did you find out anything about deleting wiki pages? 

 '''st33med''' Next topic: compositing 

 '''st33med''' ? 

 '''st33med''' :P 

 '''Presto123''' hrm...bodhi no one still for hardware? 

18:40 '''Joeb454''' ok just getting my head sorted :) I'm up for doing launchpad as well, depending on what needs to be done :) 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' as a sidenote on that, i think we just need to have them forward to existing pages so we dont create broken links 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' Not every one needs to join a focus group, but if you are interested 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' Presto123, we are the hardware team 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' Joeb454, im on LP, too, i may need to back out of that one if time becomes an issue 

 '''Joeb454''' me too 

 '''ajmorris''' what is the role of the compositing team.... 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' ie helping new users == helping with hardware 

 '''Alan_M''' everyone in here is the hardware team as far as im concered...heh 

 '''Joeb454''' ajmorris, compiz? 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' Rocket2DMn, no, nothing re deleting 

 '''Presto123''' yeah...maybe but, its blank there...kind of would be disheartening for new users i guess 

 '''st33med''' not my expertise 

18:41 '''Rocket2DMn''' ok bodhi_zazen , we'll look more into it 

 '''Presto123''' just my thoughts 

 '''ajmorris''' ah kk Joeb454 

 '''Joeb454''' i think anyway 

 bodhi_zazen Actually, nest on the agenda is: 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' 

 '''Presto123''' I'm going to edit that page...bb in a sec 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' Regular meetings 

 '''Joeb454''' I believe I brought that up 

 '''st33med''' EVERY DAY!!! 

18:42 '''st33med'''  

 '''Joeb454''' I was thinking more of once a month, or once every 2 months 

 '''Alan_M''' set times daily would kill me :/ 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' I am up for regular meetings, so long as people show up, not that the 
current group has this problem 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' Monthly seems best, IMO 

 '''st33med''' every month sounds good 

 '''Joeb454''' yeah 

 '''ajmorris''' hmm, since i help on irc and forums with compositing, ill sign up for compositing on focus teams, as they co-incide :) and also, that makes st33med not so lonely 

 '''Alan_M''' yeah 

 '''Old_Soldier''' +1 for monthly 

 '''janquark''' +1 for monthly 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' i wouldnt be opposed to every 2 months either 

 '''Alan_M''' +1 for monthly 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' OK, is this time best ? 

 '''st33med''' yes 

 '''Alan_M''' whenever, just let me know 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' anyone need an alternate time 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' may get a better turnout if they are less often 

 '''Joeb454''' 2200 GMT? 

 '''Alan_M''' yes, perfect time :) 

18:43 '''ajmorris''' the day is the only bad thing for me bodhi 

 '''janquark''' time is fine 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' in the past this has been the best time in terms of attendance 

 '''Alan_M''' i was just late because i was talking with parents. 

 '''ajmorris''' except weekends = good for me = not for you, so you win :P 

 '''Old_Soldier''' neutral enough. ive done this before in a world wide environment 

 '''Joeb454''' I managed to get off work early (i finish at 22:30 GMT normally) 

 '''Old_Soldier''' since we're volunteers 2200 GMT works 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' i think this is a little early in the afternoon bodhi_zazen , im only here b/c its spring breka for me 

 '''Old_Soldier''' if they were employees it wouldnt 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' its still the middle of the workday 

 '''st33med''' eating dinner 

 '''st33med''' brb 

18:44 '''bodhi_zazen''' OK, lets propose a day, second tuesday, etc and see if there is a consensus 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' We could move the time back an hour 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' recommends evenings and weekends 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' In the past attendance was POOR evs and weekends 

 '''ajmorris''' bodhi cant make weekends Rocket2DMn 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' true dat, thanks ajmorris 

 '''Joeb454''' different day 

18:45 '''Presto123''' https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Beginners/Team/FocusGroups (Just the bottom is edited) 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' I can make some weekends, but late 

 '''Joeb454''' monday? 

 '''janquark''' different day, same time for me not too early please 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' tue/wed afternoons/evenings dont work for me 

 '''Presto123''' Monday's are generally free for me... 

 '''Alan_M''' doesnt care when, im open daily :) 

 <- jacob has disconnected (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)) 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' +1 for mondays 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' Monday, tuesday, or Wed ? 

 '''Presto123''' No tuesday 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' Monday or Wed ? 

 '''spiderbatdad''' M 

18:46 '''Rocket2DMn''' +1 for monday 

 '''janquark''' monday 

 '''Presto123''' Monday 

 '''Alan_M''' M 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' sry isaid that already 

 '''ajmorris''' lol, at this time any day of the week i cant make it, an hour earlier i cant make monday tuesday or wednesday :P 

 '''ajmorris''' just leave me out of the meeting time arranging :P 

 '''Joeb454''' mondays are good for me, especially at the same time 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' Mondays, an hour later ? 

 '''janquark''' but back at home at 22.30 GMT 

 '''janquark''' I am 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' after 5PM Pacific time works for me 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' 5 PM pacific is too late for me 

18:47 '''Presto123''' Thats 8p eastern...eh, no probs here 

 '''Joeb454''' I'm fine with that bodhi (hour later on mondays) 

 '''ajmorris''' problem for me, if i wasnt on holidays ATM, i'd be in class right now 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' 4PM works 

 '''ajmorris''' my timezone is too far out for anyone else 

 '''Alan_M''' brb, need to plug in laptop or im gonna exit stage left and wont be my own doings. 

 '''spiderbatdad''' So the first Monday of the month? 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' OK, an hour later, second Monday of the month ? 

 '''janquark''' sounds good 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' First is OK too 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' sure 

 '''Alan_M''' is open for anything and everything :) 

18:48 '''Alan_M''' just not 2AM CST Please! 

 '''spiderbatdad''' I'm open, just lost track 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' First or second ? 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' maybe rotate which week of the month it is, so ppl who have conflicts can make most of them 

 '''spiderbatdad''' second sounds traditional 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' that may be getting complicated tho 

 '''Alan_M''' yeah your going into weird placements there rocket 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' Second going once ... 

 '''Alan_M''' second...SOLD for me 

 '''Joeb454''' sold to the man in the hat :D 

18:49 '''bodhi_zazen''' \o/

 '''bodhi_zazen''' Oh, IRC :) 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' irc imrpovement 

18:50 '''ajmorris''' what do we need to improve? 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' We have an irc focus group :) 

 '''Joeb454''' i believe I'm on there :) 

 '''LeAstrale''' yes we do 

 '''Alan_M''' yes we do 

 '''Presto123''' ajmorris, our outlook :P 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' There has been some discussion re : #ubuntu 

 '''Alan_M''' and i am as well 

 '''ajmorris''' how many of the people in the focus group help on #ubuntu? 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' too large, bot abuse 

 '''Joeb454''' what's the purpose of the IRC focus group though? 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' Joeb454, we can work that out right now :) 

 '''Joeb454''' ajmorris, I do occasionally 

 '''Alan_M''' aj, i do 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' irc focus group helps on #ubuntu 

 '''ajmorris''' help users on irc basically Joeb454 is the focus.... 

 18:51 '''Presto123''' I tried to help one time and it was absolute aggravation 

 '''Joeb454''' ugh, I have to venture out into #ubuntu as well :( 

 '''Joeb454''' lol 

 '''ajmorris''' i tend to help them in pm out of the busyness of #ubuntu, perhaps we could 
bring them here where more than 1 person can help them? 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' First, a few comments about the beginner team somehow moderating #ubuntu .... 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' i will remove myself from the irc team 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' Leave that to the mods 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' The culture on the fourms is not the same as irc 

18:52 '''bodhi_zazen''' If you want to assist on #ubuntu , go for it 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' If you want to assist someone ... 

 '''Presto123''' YES! bodhi_zazen...give us mod power...sometimes, I would just love it, not to abuse but just clean it up 

 '''Joeb454''' what about the IRC focus group calling in certain people from #ubuntu if they get no replies 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' ./join #boshi_zazen 

 '''Presto123''' I know you cant control the decision there, but dang 

18:53 '''bodhi_zazen''' *#boshi_zazen 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' LOL 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' #bodhi_zazen 

 '''Joeb454''' or the standard !thishasnothingtodowithyourquestion | user 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' now invite 

 '''Presto123''' LOL bodhi 

 '''LeAstrale''' LMAO @ bodhi_zazen 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' RE: the different focuses, from https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Beginners/Team/FocusGroups i would like to take off all the stupid links to the UF profiles, except under Forums. Other links on other subsections should be for that specific focus, like a link to LP profiles under Launchpad 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' pleas join me on #bodhi_zazen 

 '''janquark''' who? 

 '''LeAstrale''' what? now? 

18:54 '''bodhi_zazen''' sure ... 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' sorry, wanted to throw that out there before it skipped my mind and we got completely off the focus group topic 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' OK, now I have a channel of my own, I own / moderate the channel and can 
kick / ban 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' I can give support quietly 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' ./join #bodhi_zazen 

18:55 '''Rocket2DMn''' err 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' Rocket2DMn, no . 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' thanks :) 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' if you /join a new channel , you own it 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' too much time at a terminal, you understand 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' that is how irc works 

 '''Alan_M''' yep, and when they throw the famous !pm at you because you tell a user to 
private message you...thats awesome. 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' if anyone wants help settign up a channel, let me know 

18:56 '''LeAstrale''' back to meeting 

 '''Joeb454''' so if the IRC focus group wants to assist somebody, we can set up a neutral channel 

18:57 '''bodhi_zazen''' OK, that is my proposal to offer assistance to #ubuntu 

 '''Joeb454''' invite the person off #ubuntu and ask anybody in here to come join too 

 Rocket2DMn +1 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' Joeb454, yep 

 '''Presto123''' good good 

 '''ajmorris''' i dont see why we cant bring them here?.... 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' I will help you 

 '''Presto123''' :) 

 '''janquark''' +1 

 '''Presto123''' I really think something to add 

 '''Joeb454''' ajmorris, I think bodhi wants to keep this to team members and not create another #ubuntu 

 '''st33med''' ajmorris, bringing them here would cause flooding 

 '''ajmorris''' ah, kk 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' ajmorris, you can do that too, if you want 

 '''spiderbatdad''' this is not a good place for everyine sometimes 

 '''Joeb454''' I think the neutral channel isn't a bad idea 

 '''Alan_M''' as I have a few times 

18:58 '''st33med''' but then word would spread!! 

 '''spiderbatdad''' everyone* 

 '''Presto123''' create a specific name that we can join or create if it isn't already running 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' I prefer a neutral channel 

 '''ajmorris''' #beginners-help ?

 '''Alan_M''' aaaaaaaannd back to the discussion 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' #beginners-help 

 '''Alan_M''' lol 

 '''st33med''' #your mom 

 '''Presto123''' right right 

 '''janquark''' +1 for beginners-help 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' well that discussion went downhill fast 

 '''Alan_M''' yes #beginners-help works 

 '''st33med''' +1 for 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' \o/ 

 '''st33med''' that 

 '''Joeb454''' ajmorris, I'll give you a hand with the IRC F.G :) I'm always on here 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' just make sure beginners-help is not in use 

 '''Presto123''' minus the dash for simplicity 

19:00 '''ajmorris''' irc fg?? 

 '''Joeb454''' focus group 

 '''ajmorris''' ah kk 

 '''ajmorris''' kewl 

 '''Presto123''' #beginnershelp 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' ajmorris, if you set up a channel, please allow me to admin it as well 

 '''Joeb454''' me too ;) 

 '''Joeb454''' lol 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' :) 

 '''st33med''' can we get ubotu in there as well? 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' Any other issues with #ubuntu ? 

 '''Presto123''' Could it not be admin'ed by the beginners team in general? 

19:01 '''bodhi_zazen''' No, not too many admins 

 '''Presto123''' or is it limited by num 

 '''Presto123''' got it 

 -> overdrank has joined ubuntuforums-beginners 

 ChanServ sets user mode +v: overdrank may now speak if the room is moderated 

 '''st33med''' what about ubotu? 

 '''st33med''' overdrank, you are LATE 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' I do not mind if members of the irc focus group have admin rights 

 '''Alan_M''' what happens when all the admins are gone and were sitting here like a stuck duck and someones flooding the hell outta the channel? 

 '''overdrank''' yea sorry st33med 

 '''st33med''' ^^ 

 '''Presto123''' thats my thoughts Alan_M 

 '''Alan_M''' nevermind that answered that question :) 

19:02 '''bodhi_zazen''' If we make a channel, we need a committment to admin it 

 '''st33med''' ChanServ? 

 '''Presto123''' definitely 

 '''Joeb454''' Alan_M, I'm ALWAYS on IRC whenever I'm online 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' sec ... 

 '''Alan_M''' Joeb454: same here 

 '''Joeb454''' If I can't get onto Xchat, I'm on Mibbit 

 '''Alan_M''' if im off of irc..im offline period 

 '''LeAstrale''' likes Joeb454's loyality towards #ubuntuforums-beginners 

19:03 '''Joeb454''' :D 

 '''Joeb454''' thanks LeAstrale 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' OK, next topic ? 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' Recruitment 

 '''Presto123''' I got the one I wanted in :P 

 '''LaRoza''' Tiger pits? 

 '''Joeb454''' I thought we just PM'd you with potential members, and then PM'd them 

 '''Joeb454''' Rancor fights ;) 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' In general I like to recruit at a slow pace 

 '''Joeb454''' watches Star Wars too much 

19:04 '''Presto123''' spiderbatdad ;) 

 '''spiderbatdad''' aye 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' Last thing we need is a disruptive team member 

 '''st33med''' ChanServ is up and running 

 '''Joeb454''' *cough* LeAstrale *cough* 

 '''Presto123''' we all wanted you as a member ;) 

 '''spiderbatdad''' Presto123 ty 

19:05 '''Joeb454''' its true 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' I like "the quiz" as it s a chance to see a person's temperment 

 '''Joeb454''' we all like the quiz 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' =D 

 '''janquark''' ;) 

 '''Alan_M''' the quiz PWNZ 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' i liked taking the quiz, i was like BRING IT 

 '''Presto123''' I think for sure we all should check whenever we SUGGEST a member 

 '''Alan_M''' of course got the hard questions and the easy questions i sucked at :( 

 '''Presto123''' check their posts that is 

19:06 '''bodhi_zazen''' I do not mind team members recruiting on the forums 

 '''Presto123''' It's okay Alan_M, I really bombed it 

 '''Joeb454''' I tend to invite them here to IRC too, to see if they can cope with us 

 '''Alan_M''' when we recruit like 400 a day, thats kinda overkill though :( 

 '''Presto123''' lol Joeb454 

 '''spiderbatdad''' seems like it recruits could be suggested at meetings 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' yea, for bettor worse they need to irc 

19:07 '''Presto123''' I agree with spiderbatdad and bodhi_zazen 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' I have allowed some to join who do not irc, but we never hear from them 

 '''LeAstrale''' Alan_M: its the wheelchair limiting you. its holds back the force 

 '''Presto123''' slow and meeting suggested 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' recruitment is open at this time 

 '''Joeb454''' yeah not a bad idea, though it'd just end up having a pile of people to quiz 

 '''ajmorris''' if you see a committed member or someone on the forums, with a big enough post count, dont be afraid to send em over to the UA team also :D 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' i think we kinda need to enforce irc as a means of communication 

 '''Joeb454''' yeah 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' +1 for the UA team 

19:08 '''Rocket2DMn''' it needs more help 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' Rocket2DMn, I do that when I PM a potential recruit 

 '''Alan_M''' looks at aj and chuckles 

 '''st33med''' I sorta liked how bodhi quizzed. I think we should keep him quizzing! 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' LOL st33med 

 '''Presto123''' UA needs definite attention IMO... 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' +1 Presto123 

 '''ajmorris''' what Alan_M? 

 '''Joeb454''' different group though really isn't it 

 '''Presto123''' I try to stick with them 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' please help the UA team if at all possible 

 '''Alan_M''' im laughing at my private message to you on the forums about UA.....and my inability to READ lol 

 '''spiderbatdad''' UA= Un Answered? 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' Once a week search on UA posts ? 

19:09 '''Presto123''' yeah spiderbatdad 

 '''Alan_M''' unanswered post team spiderbatdad 

 '''Joeb454''' bodhi_zazen, I'm on UA anyway :) 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' yea, we have a few cross members 

 '''Alan_M''' isnt on the team but ill throw my hat in the ring sometimes in there :) 

 '''ajmorris''' so is Presto123 yet he doenst come on teh irc channel :/ 

 '''ajmorris''' hehe 

 '''Presto123''' I would say MORE...but 

 '''Presto123''' psh 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' not te be confused with our resident cross dressers 

 '''ajmorris''' anyway, no more UA, this is BT meeting :P 

 '''Presto123''' AHAHA 

 '''spiderbatdad''' what are they mad about? 

19:10  '''Rocket2DMn''' checks for UA posts almost every day 

 '''overdrank''' bodhi_zazen if I may ask what happened to the hardware team 

 '''LeAstrale''' what was the hardware team doing? 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' the problem with UA posts is if you dont get them in the first 6 hours or so, they rarely get responded to 

 '''Joeb454''' collaborative effort I think 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' The hardware team has no members other then myself, atm 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' so it has been rolled into the beginners team 

 '''Presto123''' ajmorris, just to make it clear to me...I wasn't auto added was I? 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' didnt we agree the HW team was really all of us? 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' and then, what Rocket2DMn said 

 '''Alan_M''' rocket, i thought so 

19:11 '''ajmorris''' Presto123, you're on teh team aren't you? 

 '''st33med''' he is 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' somebody already changed the FocusGroups page for that 

 '''st33med''' else he would not have a dot 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' OK, last agenda item : 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' Assess on a continual basis the top needs of users, and ways to assist 

 '''st33med''' I need food 

 '''Presto123''' What I would like to say to UA's as well...is that no matter how much they uh complain, don't answer if you cant assist...so we can hit that button and see 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' That is the point of maintaining an IRC channel for the team 

 '''ajmorris''' BTW... bodhi, how come uf bt members dont go in a group on http://ubuntuforums.org/showgroups.php 

19:12 '''Presto123''' ? ajmorris, beginner's team, yeah...but I didn't know about UA 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' ajmorris, I don't know 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' too big ? 

 bodhi_zazen oversight ? 

 '''ajmorris''' oh, lol, you're not Presto123 :P 

19:13 '''bodhi_zazen''' Any other comments for the last agenda item ? 

 '''st33med''' nope 

 '''Alan_M''' nada 

 '''janquark''' no 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' negative 

 '''st33med''' zilch 

 '''st33med''' zero 

 '''st33med''' nothing 

 '''Presto123''' ...uhhh... 

19:14 '''LeAstrale''' im gonna have to read the logs since i missed the first 55 minutes :'( 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' Any other topics ? 

 '''st33med''' lol 

 '''Presto123''' IRC is the best way to do that IMO 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' I have one ... 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' There has been the suggestion of a Security team 

 '''Joeb454''' yeah 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' i dont suggest that we deal with or organize that 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' Lets identify any interested beginner team members and make a new focus group 

19:15 '''Presto123''' Beginners Team Rent-a-Cops...good name for the group :p 

 '''Joeb454''' though I think that should be part of the server subsection 

 '''st33med''' Why a security team? 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' that is beyond the scope of most of our capabilities and realm of knowlege 

 '''Presto123''' I definitely am out of my league there 

 '''st33med''' security for forums or Ubuntu? 

 '''LeAstrale''' im out my league with security 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' I dont know, there are some here who know some security and I think we should pass on that knowledge 

 '''janquark''' agree with Rocket2DMn, what would be the purpose of this group? 

 '''LeAstrale''' security for windows i could do LOL 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' we all have some tips, but if you jump onto the security bandwagon, i think you better know a lot more than just a few things 

 '''Presto123''' shouldnt that be a focus group? 

 '''Alan_M''' i know security..but....there isnt much to it. 

19:16 '''st33med''' hem 

 '''ajmorris''' tronyx should lead security IMHO if he's interessted... he is our resident expert 

 '''st33med''' prevent pipe bombs 

 '''ajmorris''' of course, he may not want to 

 '''Joeb454''' thats true 

 '''st33med''' no sudo rm stuff 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' purpose from my perspective is to make sure new users get quality 
security advice 

 '''Joeb454''' tronyx is always checking vayde's server 

 '''Alan_M''' my GIRLFRIEND should lead the security team LOL 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' If a security team is forumed , we can support it fast 

19:17 '''st33med''' Have hacking competitions on our own computers? 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' i just think security is dangerous waters if you start posting in that forum b/c some of the people asking in there are real world IT and server admins with real prices to pay if security falters 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' Sounds like it may be a small focus group here 

 '''Presto123''' lol Alan_M. Flooding the forums with DON"T SUDO RM ANYTHING! 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' which is OK 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' Rocket2DMn, +1 

 '''LeAstrale''' the best to secure is to make a deny rule for paultag :P 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' that is why I think we should have a focus group 

19:18 '''st33med''' see if we can bypass our own security on one's own computer? 

 '''Alan_M''' ill be a part of that focus group 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' If nothing else, report it to someone more knowledgable 

 '''LeAstrale''' Rocket2DMn: i know exactly what you mean im a real admin and i use the forums :) 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' bodhi_zazen, i dont think that makes sense for the Absolute Beginner's team. that seems like something that should be its own separate UF team 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' OK, how about security for beginners ? 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' security starts at installation 

 '''ajmorris''' ok, all IRC focus group members have auto voice in #beginners-help now :) 

 '''Presto123''' give it time Rocket2DMn... 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' you wrote a fabulous HowTo on that didnt you? 

 '''Alan_M''' exactly what i was thinking bodhi 

19:19 '''Presto123''' let it build and form maybe? 

 '''spiderbatdad''' I seem to lack focus 

 '''ajmorris''' and, as part of your jobs in the security team, you have to teach ajmorris how to hack 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' ok, well ive voiced my opinion, if you want to give it a try, ill support it 

 '''spiderbatdad''' ;( 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' OK, lets see if there is an interest on the team to start a security focus group, if not it is OK to dye off too 

 '''Alan_M''' educate our users on why encrypting a FS is a good idea is a good start on the security FG. 

 '''Presto123''' ack...ajmorris, i haven't joined a focus group yet 

 '''Old_Soldier''' Just made it back who do i sign on with for the forum and Irc teams 

19:20 '''bodhi_zazen''' Alan_M, did you see my post on encryption ? 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' resizing an encrypted partition ? 

 '''ajmorris''' i think the security focus group would be good 

 '''ajmorris''' hey Maddeth 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' I hope that post is educational re: encryption in general 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' OK, vote on security focus ? 

 '''st33med''' +1 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' anyone interest either +1 or -1 ... 

19:21 '''Presto123''' +1 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' -1 

 '''Alan_M''' +1 

 '''Old_Soldier''' -1 

 '''spiderbatdad''' 0 

 '''Joeb454''' 0 

 '''ajmorris''' +1 

 '''janquark''' too big for me now, perhaps if I learm more security stuff I will join 

 '''Old_Soldier''' thinks the server and secuity forum tems have that covered 

 '''spiderbatdad''' i'm for learning, as well 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' OK, looks like there is a narrow margin in favor ? 

 '''st33med''' ditto 

19:22 '''Rocket2DMn''' mark that focus group as experimental i guess 

 '''Presto123''' Move to next meeting bodhi_zazen ? 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' OK, we will see what happens then 

 '''ajmorris''' i think there should be a team, although, ill be on teh learning end most 
likely, i can do a bit of security, but realistically, im crap 

 '''Rocket2DMn''' +! Presto123 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' Next meeting .... 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' 4/8/08 

 '''bodhi_zazen''' 5 PM MTN
