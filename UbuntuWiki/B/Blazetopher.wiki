== Introduction ==
Hi all.  I'm ''very'' new to the world of linux, but so far it's grabbing hold of me!!  I have Dapper F4 installed as a dual boot with Windows XP on my laptop.  I've been having some issues (everything from not being able to install due to ''acpi'' problems, to not being able to go wireless - which is still an issue), but I'm excited about ubuntu as a whole and looking forward to learning all I can.  Eventually I hope to move on to coding, testing, and development - but that's all still some way down the road!

=== About Me ===
I'm a 27 year old Oceanographer/GIS Technician working for a small Environmental Consulting company in Rhode Island, USA.  ''more here later''
