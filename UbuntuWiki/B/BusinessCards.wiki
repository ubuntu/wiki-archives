Ubuntu members are entitled to Ubuntu business cards.  Once you have successfully completed the <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/community/processes/newmember|membership process]]</nowiki>, you will be added to the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntumembers/+members|list of members]]</nowiki> and are entitled to carry and use Ubuntu cards.

=== 2022 Branding ===
''Nothing here yet.''

=== 2010 Branding ===

You need to print your own cards, using any template below (or your own). Take note of potential printing issues on each card and the author's site.

The artwork posted here is in SVG format, which can be opened easily with Inkscape. However, unless your local print shop has expertise with SVG, you'll want to export it as a PDF/PostScript or other vector/high-resolution format.

=== Classic Branding ===

''Please use the 2010 versions of the branding above.''

You need to print your own cards, using this <nowiki>[[attachment:ubuntu_business_cards.tgz|artwork]]</nowiki> or <nowiki>[[attachment:free_ubuntu_business_cards.tgz|this free artwork]]</nowiki>. ''Note: Arial is not a free font; it is part of the msttcorefonts package available from the Multiverse repository''.

Note that this artwork is in Adobe Illustrator format, as we have found that most convenient for some printers, although postscript (ps) or pdf are the best formats to export to when dealing with any sort of printing as they describe how the image is to be printed rather than displayed. You can import Illustrator files to some extent in more recent versions of Inkscape and export then to the more Open SVG format.

You may find Kubuntu business cards, using the Feisty plain logo <nowiki>[[attachment:KubuntuBusCard.svg|here]]</nowiki>.

'''Update''': Uploaded an <nowiki>[[attachment:UbuntuBusCardFA-2.svg|SVG export]]</nowiki> of the Illustrator file.  This is fully editable in Inkscape.  Please let <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/people/trappist|me]]</nowiki> know if you find any problems with the file (not for support) as it was exported it from Illustrator. SVG is a W3C standard supported by Adobe and based on XML, more information can be found on their website <nowiki>[[http://w3c.org|w3c]]</nowiki>

'''Update''': You can download this business card from <nowiki>[[attachment:ubuntu_card.tar.gz|www.OnlyDesigns.com.br]]</nowiki> it is licensed under GPL.
