| Contact Export
| WillCooke
| In development
| Exports your phone contacts via AT commands to try and make it compatible with as many phone devices as possible, and turn them into Vcards.  I had a quick hack working ages ago, but will refresh it. Also works for calendar entries.

| MP3 Upload
| WillCooke
| In my head
| Sync/Upload MP3's etc to your phone/device a bit like a podcast.  An example might be a weekly radio/tv comedy that is recorded by Myth TV and then turned in to a suitable format for your device (gstreamer for this?) then when your phone comes in range it is uploaded via obex
