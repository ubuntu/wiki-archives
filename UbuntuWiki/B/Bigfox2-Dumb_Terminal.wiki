== How to setup a Dumb Terminal using an Upstart script ==

Dumb Terminals can still be quite useful for some tasks.

Create a the file /etc/event.d/ttyS0  (Replace ttyS0 with whatever port you are connecting the dumb terminal to)

Paste this script into the file.  Alter as required for your configuration.
<pre>

start on runlevel 2
start on runlevel 3
start on runlevel 4
start on runlevel 5
start on stopped ttyS0  #restarts the terminal if it is exited or crashes

stop on shutdown

respawn
exec /sbin/getty 19200 ttyS0 vt100  
</pre>

One thing to note, if you turn on the terminal after the host computer boots up, it will take up to a minute for the login prompt to be displayed on the terminal, but it will show up.
