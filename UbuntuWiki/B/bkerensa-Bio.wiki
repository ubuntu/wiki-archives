__TOC__

Hi I'm Benjamin Kerensa and I've been using Ubuntu since 2008 (Heron) although have used Linux in general since 2000. I spend a lot of time contributing to the Ubuntu Oregon LoCo Community as a Team Lead which involves a lot of communications, outreach and event planning. In my spare time I like listen to music (RythmBox) and I'm big on Social Media.
