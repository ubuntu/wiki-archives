__TOC__

Breno is unusual in that he is a Microsoft Windows user with a day job in Niteroi, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, who also has a strong interest in Linux and Open Source software. He had looked at many different Linux distributions but had not found one that "just works" until Ubuntu 7.04 (Feisty Fawn) filled that bill. Since he is not a developer or a programmer, he struggled to find a way to give back to the Open Source community.
