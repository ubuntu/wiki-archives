=== Background ===

I am currently a student, pursuing MCA (Masters Of Computer Applications) in India. I've completed my graduation in Computer Applications.
My first experience with Linux was in 2005, but I started using it seriously since 2006. My first 'serious' Linux distro was (of course) Ubuntu.
I am a pure techie and I love helping out other people; I always try my best to solve people's problems, be it Linux related or anything a geek can solve.

----
=== IRC Information ===

I'm mostly active in Freenode, My primary nick there is '''''gastly''''' and you can see my lurking about in any Ubuntu channel, like #ubuntu-doc or #ubuntu

----
=== Skills ===

As a student of computers, I know several programming languages; I'm well equipped with: C/C++, Perl, PHP and Bash. Other languages that I know are: Java and Python.
I'm also a web developer/designer and I know a fair amount of HTML and CSS. 

I'm a self-proclaimed artist... and I love to tinker with graphics software, mainly Gimp and make some random things in it. I like making banners, logo's, wallpapers and stuff, just for fun :)

Also, I simply love writing about technology and Linux / Ubuntu in general. 

----
=== Involvement ===

* Helping out users in the Ubuntu forums.
* Helped the doc's team with writing Kubuntu documentation for Lucid.
* I have also written some guides and tutorials on my <nowiki>[[http://kbhaskar.in/|blog]]</nowiki> about Ubuntu and Linux in general.
* I contribute to Linux magazines particularly Linux Identity Magazine's Ubuntu issue where I write tutorials and guides about Ubuntu

----
=== Future Ideas for Ubuntu ===

* Organizing more events related to Ubuntu and FOSS.
* Joining more projects related to Ubuntu and contributing to them.
* Helping on the forums and IRC has always been a great experience and also it's fun, so I'd continue doing that as long as I can.
* Programming is my favorite pastime and in the future, I would love to take some time off and help existing projects.
