 {*} Have a wiki page describing yourself and your contributions. For help on creating an Ubuntu wiki page <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BeginnersTeam/Membership/BTWikiGuide|See here]]</nowiki>. this page will be important not only to introduce yourself to others but also to document your community contributions.<<BR>>

We are adopting a system where all members will be more accessible to help with questions and concerns. If you want to know more about a topic please post the question on our mailing list. This will gain the most exposure across the most members. We also recommend asking in our IRC channel (actually I recomend this frist). If in IRC you do not get an immediate answer dont give up. Sometimes it takes a while for members to log in and see your message. Many members have a persistent IRC connection to catch all questions, answers, and conversations. We are just starting to transition to this new system. Please help us decide what works and what does not. Our main goal is to help members get involved in the community and learn as much as possible about Ubuntu. Our hope is that new members will gain knowledge and continue to pass the knowlede on to upcoming Ubuntu users.
