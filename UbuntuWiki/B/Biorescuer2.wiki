Hi, every body
 
 well, first of all I am kaveh Mihtashami 26 years old. I am qualified in Biotechnology (M.Sc.) and I live Tehran/Iran. I am a Perl programmer and I'm going to creat a very complete Bioinformatics package called Rubisco-Bioinformatics package (i will make a website same as this name). I'd like to add bioinformatics software to Add/Remove part of UBUNTU to make this great Linux more popular for academic and research department. also i'd like to propose creating a version calles Bio-UBUNTU for Biologists. In order to my aim, I've been introducing and recommending UBUNTU to academic and research department in Iran, I've been trying hard. well, that was all about me.
