== Idea ==

Create a warning message when a usb device is plugged into a usb port with a different version. Explaining to the user that the device may run slower and files may not transfer quickly.

== Added Feature ==

Advise if there is another more appropriate usb port to plug the device into and if it's free and what is plugged into it if it's not (a device say that isn't usb 2.0)
