=== Hardware Time Avaliable ===
I am able (and happy!) to donate hardware time (over SSH, VNC, etc) for anyone who wants to test out their new apps/packages for Ubuntu. The spec is:
** Dual PIII 1133MHz per cpu
** 1024MB RAM
** 40GB HDD
** Multiple NICs:
*** Various copper 100Mbps cards
*** One fibre 1Gbps card
** ADSL internet connection (so nothing special, sorry):
*** 2048kbps downstream
*** 256kbps upstream

If you think that you (and hopefully Ubuntu) will benefit from testing time on this machine, please email me at the address above and I will be happy to consider. If you need a fresh install of Ubuntu (or a specific release), please let me know when you apply.

Thanks all...
