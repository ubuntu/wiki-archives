'''Report'''

Great event! For this first event for LouvainLinux it was a success. It was not crowded of people, but they were a few people regulary. About the conference for Ubuntu it was a succes, the public appreciate the presentation and they were about 30 people. The infrastructure is very interesting to organise bigger event. And in the futur for the release of the 11.10 they will organise a big event for Ubuntu with us.

In general a lot of people were interested by Ubuntu and of course everybody know Ubuntu :). Maybe it could interesting for Louvainlinux to make communication to make come people who don't know well the free software.
