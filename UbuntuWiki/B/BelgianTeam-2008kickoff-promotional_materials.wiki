=== Discussion ===
 Budget: There's about EUR 500,- but it should pay itself mostly back.
 It stays the question: Money money:
   -  Possibility to sell poster (or more general: 'material') and add earned money to the budget

Difference in two kinds of material:
 a) Promotional material to give away
 b) Promotional 'gadget?' material to sell, to pay for the give-away material in a)

=== Possible materials ===

==== marketing material (Give away for free) ====
   - small flyer (fast to read, like the current existing)
   - multi-page fyers (at fairs...)
   - posters
   - stickers? (with maybe *only* the ubuntu logo, small (few cm))
   - promotion-kit for hardware vendors

==== Gadget material (as some kind of money machine to pay for the marketing material) ====
   - i.e. USB-sticks..?
   - pencils...
   - possible problem: selling this at fairs may result in loosing the 'non-profit-org'-subscription fee
   - T-shirts: Pierre's brother's company could get some printed. Don't limit to T-shirts, you can make more textile's like:
     -  cap-sweater...
   - Other ideas:
     - Ask money for computer-club-visits in name of ubuntu-be and the money goes to ubuntu-be
     - Ask money at ubuntu-install-parties? (Now it is a free gift: keep that way?)
     - Ask an organisation to put our name (ubuntu-be) as 'organising party' for a bingo-night (<ref: Rob)

==== Media-attention 'material' ====
   - just walk around in train stations and give away flyers
   - by doing a 'ridiculous' action ('koe-schijt actie')
   - in some way get radio-time (?) by calling in to stubru or something (when we have something to say!)
   - *ACTION* ideas:
     - Have an 'event-day' where journalists are invited with machines installed ...
     - buy a cake and give to euro.-parlement to thank them about the last action to 'force' MS to be more open
     - give ubuntu-cd to Belgian minister of automation to pass the message of free, open software
     - *MAKE SURE* to:
         - communicate this correct to press, have a press-release text ready for these kind of things
         - use only 'hot issues'

==== Target audience ====
* Existing users, who can get 'gadgets'?
* New users
* School-kids, young, old
* ...

==== Where ====
* Schools: everything we print, add material to a 'stock for schools'
* For shops: Flyer & pricelist, poster "We Do Ubuntu"
* At your house (if you're a support point i.e.)
* On your car
* ...

==== Posters ====
* printking.be -> 155€ for the 1st 250 + 20 per 250, 180€ for 1000
* flyprint.be -> 145 for the 1st 250 + 21 per 250 (5% sponsoring possible)
* idrukker.nl -> 280 for 1000 + 65 per 1000

=== Actions ===
* Decide on a milk-cow gadget to use as money-input for the creation of the free material
