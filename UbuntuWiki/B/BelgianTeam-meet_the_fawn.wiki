* WHERE: <nowiki>[[http://www.parcanimalier.net/acces.htm|Parc Animalier de La Reid]]</nowiki>

=== Report ===
* People present: Annelies Bollen, Mark Van den Borre, Benoît Plunus, Bénédicte Tondeur, Alexandre Laurent
* Summary: After a bit of delay (sorry Benoît for making you wait 1 hour), the minibus arrived in La Reid. We had the chance to see deer, wild boars, wolves, foxes, squirrels and other animals. Most fawns weren't so young anymore, but we did manage to spot '''Feisty''' nonetheless. All in all, it's been a nice and quiet afternoon, a nice walk in this park, which ended around ice cream and drinks. Not so bad...
