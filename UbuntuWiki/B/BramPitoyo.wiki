'''Briefly:''' Bram Pitoyo is a dashing account planner-slash-creative researcher who believes that 1) a brand should sing killer choruses with an equally beautiful opus, and that 2) there needs to be someone around here who is part-sociologist and part-software-developer, that is able to 1) bridge the gap between both worlds, and 2) concept and create some truly ''mean'' but ''human'' user experiences.
