Use this page to share your ubuntu buddy icons with others.  Or just find one you like and use it!  See the <nowiki>[[http://gaim.sourceforge.net/faq.php#q44|Gaim faq]]</nowiki> for directions on how to set a buddy icon in Gaim.

<nowiki>[[http://www.gimp.org/tutorials/Creating_Icons/|GIMP]]</nowiki> works well for creating buddy icons if you would like to try making one yourself.  The <nowiki>[[http://gaim.sourceforge.net/faq.php#q44|Gaim faq]]</nowiki> has some guidelines for creating your buddy icons: 
* The file must be smaller than 4KB.
* The image size should be 48x48 or 50x50 in most cases.  Although technically it should be able to have any dimensions, and can be in any format.
* If you wish Windows users to see it, it must be in a format Windows understands, such as .bmp, .gif, and .jpg.
