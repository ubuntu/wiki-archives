== About Me ==

'''NOTE:''' Before I start, I'm only a Ubuntu Community member, not a developer/coder. I use Ubuntu Linux to get away from Windows and Mac.  I'm a biologist that will most likely do research not developing programs.

My name is Svetlana Belkin and I'm an Ubuntu Linux user since 2009. I made the switch from Windows XP and found about Ubuntu from Lifehacker. I was casually involved since 2012 but I got more dedicated in 2013 when I started get involved, I tried to answer questions and to police Ask Ubuntu (link to my profile under contact information) for missing tags on questions and report questions that break the rules.

Around early 2013, I started to get more involved into the Ubuntu Community because I had ideas for new programs, but I'm not a developer who codes. I knew that I might get a lead on Ubuntu Women, since I am a woman and it is a smaller part of the Ubuntu Community. In July 2013, I joined the mailing-list and quickly discovered that I was not the only one who had a hard time finding a team to be part of or how to get involved. This started my work on updating the Ubuntu-Women wiki and to create material to help other women to get involved. Then three months later, I joined the Ubuntu Documentation Team also to help keeping the Ubuntu Community Help Wiki up to date.

The membership that I had for the longest of a team was for Ubuntu Ohio.  I joined in 2009, shortly after I made the switch, but I only started to get involved in 2013. As a member of the Ohio Team and as an active member I also act as one of the Point of Contacts for my !LoCo in order to participate in the !LoCo contacts mailing list to learn what other !LoCo's are doing and share what my !LoCo is doing.

I founded the Ubuntu Scientists team on January 16, 2014 since the Ubuntu Community does not had the team for the scientists of all sorts. This team will act like The Ubuntu Women team in order to help people to get jobs in the science FOSS field.

I also mentor at <nowiki>[[http://linuxpadawan.net/|Linux Padawan]]</nowiki>- main focus is on Ubuntu Community building.

== Future Goals ==

Most of my goals will do with helping more people to get involved in the Ubuntu Community by helping them learning how to get involved and to provide them with up to date documentation wherever and whenever necessary. This holds true for all the teams that I am part of.

As for Ohio Team, I would like to reach out to my fellow Ohioan Ubuntu users and meet them in person.

In the short time I've been working with Svetlana, I could see that she is always willing to improve things. She is doing a great job as a point of contact on the Ubuntu-US-OH community, and her work always fulfuills your expectations. Congratulations, keep up the good efforts, and thanks for them! -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:jose]]</nowiki> 
Svetlana is extremely eager to take charge and lead. As part of the '''Delegation of Authority''' being issued from  due to my change in employment status that has some rather harsh terms of employment, she has taken a hard-charging lead along with <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:Unit193]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:jamesgifford]]</nowiki> as fellow deputies.  As a deputy to the Point of Contact/Leader, Svetlana has already started her own initiative to <nowiki>[[https://lists.launchpad.net/ubuntu-us-ohio/msg01393.html|hold virtual Ubuntu hours]]</nowiki> among other efforts.  I am aware of the hard work she has put in as a member of the Docs team which show her commitment to Ubuntu as well.  This is not an isolated surge of activity but rather continuing effort that will enrich the Ubuntu realm overall, I feel.  I commend the application. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:skellat]]</nowiki> 
I work with Svetlana on <nowiki>[[help.ubuntu.com-community | Community Help Wiki]]</nowiki> and she has a tremendous passion for improving the quality of the communities documentation. She exihibits a tireless reserve of energy and an eagerness to contribute to Ubuntu. I believe her contributions are significant and sustained and warrant her being approved as an Ubuntu member. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:cprofitt]]</nowiki> 
As a member of the Documentation Team I have noticed Svetlana's dedication to improving the Ubuntu documentation. A proper documentation is important for attracting new Ubuntu users and community members, so thank you, Svetlana! -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:gunnarhj]]</nowiki> 
As a member of the Ohio Loco team, I have noticed her hardwork and dedication to the Ubuntu community, and I highly recommend her for Ubuntu membership, her contributions are significant and sustained. --<nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:jamesgifford]]</nowiki>

== CC Election ==

=== 2015 ===

This is my first time running for the CC. I am a community builder not a developer or a coder like most of the community but that does not mean that the Community does not need community builders.  In fact, any community needs them in order to create growth and somethings are understood by these people more than developers/coders would know.

My three main goals within the CC are to create the next generation of leaders, understanding the politics that the Community faces, and to understand the various processes that our Community has in a deeper meaning.
