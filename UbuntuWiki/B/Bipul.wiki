=== About Me ===
Hi, my name is Bipul. I am 25 years old and I live in India. I am self learner and self motivated person. Recently I have completed my graduation in information technology. I am interested in Computer science, mathematics, programming, studying managerial skills, traveling and eating delicious food.

Computer first appeard in my life when I was in class two, I  remember the day Madam Shalni taught us the basic hardwares of computer with digramatic pictures representation on black board,later on she taken us to school lab to see a real computer. That was in my school lab. After two years when i was in class 4th i used to do programming in ,logo, basics and pascal.I remember myself thinking,that it was the best thing in the world.

Then I had got my first PC. I remember the day, I have first installed on my PC with Minix  which I got it from Tech magazine.Which made me to dive in the ocean of Linux/open source and Foss. Since it was a small dam Linux which was giving me a pain. Then later on I decided to go with Ubuntu and Windows. But later I switch to Ubuntu. Since 2009 to March 2015 I have learn so many things Ubuntu.

Mentoring people has to be about '''the''' most rewarding task in the world. It has been, and remains, an absolute pleasure to be Bipul's mentor. But he is long past the stage where he needs a mentor and is now helping others. As such I ask that you look favourably upon his appication for ubuntu membership. His advocacy and being an outstanding amassador would each seperaley grant this. Put the two together and his tuition of people, we have the definition of 'ubuntu' as told by Nelsom Nandela. Bibul helps, does not need asking - it is in his naturead I am sp privalidged to call him a friend. <nowiki>[[phillw]]</nowiki> 14th Apil 2015
