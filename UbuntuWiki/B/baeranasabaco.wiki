I've used linux since 1994(ish) - Slackware 2.1, IIRC. I've since tried most every flavor since then (even Corel Linux, which no one used and was kinda sucky, but came with a cute penguin!) I've really wanted to give more back to the Linux/FOSS community lately, so I've become more active, released more, and joined more communities.

I'm contribute to several linux or f/oss projects, including Ubuntu Women<nowiki>[[http://wiki.ubuntu-women.org/baerana]]</nowiki>, the Pennsylvania Ubuntu LoCo Team -<nowiki>[[http://www.meetlinux.com/]]</nowiki> and Debian-Administration.org - <nowiki>[[http://www.debian-administration.org/users/baerana]]</nowiki>.  (though, of course, Ubuntu is the OS that has my heart).  I also write some of my own projects, and I write articles for geek-friendly websites, including those for newbies and those for more experienced users.
