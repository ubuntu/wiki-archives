'''Report'''

Dipro fair in Oostende organized in Zaal Ten Stuyver was a fairly small fair. 
The location of the booth was favourable, next to the entrance: everyone coming to the fair was walking along the booth but there was only a limited place for visitors in front of the tables. 

The booth, only 3 m., was good decorated and equipped with 2 PC, 1 TV screen and 2 laptops.

Till 16.45 h., people came in and out the fair and most had a look or stayed at the booth. Although there was less  public than in other fairs, the 3 present volunteers were permanently busy with visitors, questions and demonstrations. 

The level of the questions was fairly basic and we frequently used 2 presentations in support of our comment : "how to used a live-cd" and "standard dual-boot installation" (partition step).

People who were convinced to experiment Ubuntu have appreciated our argument "local support points can help you". 

As this was the last fair before the release of Karmic Koala 9.10, we distributed the remaining stock of 9.04 CD's, with a lot of flyers and documentation sheets "how to use a live-cd".

Finance: we received 30,5 euro of public donation and paid 28,5 euro for the booth. The remaining 2 euro will be transferred to Ubuntu-be bank account by jean7491.
