<bodhi_zazen> Start Meeting

<bodhi_zazen> ------------------

<st33med> BALLS

<bodhi_zazen> Welcome everyone

<st33med> &hi

<steambot> Sup, man!!! Pound it, bro!

<paultag> st33med: ...

<bodhi_zazen> should we run through the focus groups first or the agenda ?

<st33med> lol

<Rocket2DMn> kick the bots please, or make them be quiet

<st33med> &leave

* steambot (n=steambot@c-98-204-218-24.hsd1.va.comcast.net) has left #ubuntuforums-beginners ("Leaving channel")

<paultag> focus first

<bodhi_zazen> OK, focus groups ...

<bodhi_zazen> Wiki team -

<Rocket2DMn> reporting in

<Rocket2DMn> is that my cue?

<bodhi_zazen> :)

<bodhi_zazen> go man, anything ?

<Rocket2DMn> groovy, so as an example for other Focus Groups, we made a page for the wiki team, you can view it here - 
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Beginners/Team/FocusGroups/Wiki

<chanlog> Title: Wiki Focus Group - Community Ubuntu Documentation (at help.ubuntu.com)

<Rocket2DMn> the point is to have a separate wiki page for each focus group, if they want, to stay organized since not everybody 
is in here all the time

<Rocket2DMn> we (the wiki team) would be happy to create the page for you, maybe with a default template, and each team can use 
that page how they see fit

<bodhi_zazen> +1

<spiderbatdad> wow very nice

<bodhi_zazen> Teach is best ...

<bodhi_zazen> Have we figured out how to delete pages yet ?

<st33med> mm...

<Maddeth> Mind if i?

<bodhi_zazen> If not, I think we should work on that ;)

<Rocket2DMn> I want to point out that the Beginners area of the wiki is not really for writing Help documents

<st33med> wiki team wil make a page for compositing?

<Maddeth> on the UGA if we just erase everything on a page the page disapears

<bodhi_zazen> Maddeth, what ?

<Rocket2DMn> the wiki is for us to stay organized, Help documents can be written under the appropriate Community area

<bodhi_zazen> Yea, it is a little different on the Ubuntu wiki

<Rocket2DMn> bodhi_zazen, to have a page deleted it must be submitted to the official Wiki Team to deal with, see here - 
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WikiToDo

<chanlog> Title: WikiToDo - Community Ubuntu Documentation (at help.ubuntu.com)

<Maddeth> ok :) just seeing if i could help... shutting up

<bodhi_zazen> Please do not add help documents on the Community wiki if you do not know how !!!

<Rocket2DMn> +1

<bodhi_zazen> Ask for help

<Rocket2DMn> feel free to talk to me about that

<st33med> +32949581003.1

<Rocket2DMn> The wiki system has a logn string of different pages telling you how to use the wiki, its rather annoying

<bodhi_zazen> Yea, the Ubuntu wiki is a little difficult to learn , IMO at least

<Rocket2DMn> So, team leaders, please let me know later if you want a Focus Group page for your team

<bodhi_zazen> Anything else for the wiki team ?

<Rocket2DMn> you can email me your request if i'm not around - (REMOVED FROM LOG) 

<bodhi_zazen> If not, IRC :)

<st33med> I wouldn't know if compositing would need it, since it isn't all to big

<Rocket2DMn> thats ok st33med , we can discuss it later, i just wanted to present the idea today

<bodhi_zazen> How is our new channel ?

<Rocket2DMn> that is all from me, you may continue bodhi_zazen 

<st33med> ok

<bodhi_zazen> Should we continue it, change the name, delete it ?

<bodhi_zazen> #beginners-help ??

<st33med> Our new channel has a few people coming in sometimes

<st33med> it is pretty useful

<bodhi_zazen> Nice, do we help them ?

<st33med> Yes

<spiderbatdad> is it ok to invite folks there for one on one help now?

<bodhi_zazen> \o/

<bodhi_zazen> brb ...

<paultag> I think we just need to promote it more -- but not enough to make it #ubuntu

<bodhi_zazen> +1 paultag

<Rocket2DMn> agreed

<st33med> Only for major incidents

<Rocket2DMn> cant let ourselves become victims of our own success in there

<paultag> Link in sigs, perhaps, or the Wiki?

<Maddeth> well i dont mind sitting in there and lending a hand now and then...

<paultag> If I am idle, I would love to help

<st33med> Redirect those with minor problems back to #ubuntu if it gets worse?

<bodhi_zazen> I am in the channel from time to time, ping me if you need help

<Rocket2DMn> paultag, info in forum sigs is good, i wouldnt advertise it outside the Beginner's Wiki area tho

<paultag> Rocket2DMn: +1

<bodhi_zazen> I would not advertise the channel on the forums too much

<bodhi_zazen> PM is OK, but you will get swamped if you over do it

<bodhi_zazen> I like the idea of inviting from #ubuntu

<st33med> We should have done these meetings more often than before a month ago

<paultag> bodhi_zazen: agreed, but if we have 3 - 6 of us in there helping at most 2 people, I dont see too much use

<Rocket2DMn> bodhi_zazen, that is true, i think thats why paultag said signature, not really advertising iut in threads

<paultag> Rocket2DMn: yeah

<spiderbatdad> bodhi_zazen in a pm from #ubuntu or openly?

<bodhi_zazen> OK

<bodhi_zazen> I was thinking PM on forums

<st33med> PM spiderbatdad

<bodhi_zazen> ./msg on #ubutu

* Joeb454 forgot it was meeting day

<st33med> lol

<bodhi_zazen> 'lo Joeb454 , me too

<Joeb454> i tend to pull people over from #ubuntu to #beginners-help

<paultag> we dont want people asking how to use aptitude comming through, when someone in #ubuntu could help with a one liner

<st33med> wow, kinda sad when our leader has memory lapses :)

<Joeb454> lol

<bodhi_zazen> lol, that is a strong trait in a leader

<Joeb454> they wouldn't come through paultag

<Rocket2DMn> st33med, thats why he needs peons to remind him

<st33med> paultag, we could redirect them to #ubuntu

<paultag> Joeb454: if we start trying to redirect everyone there though

<paultag> st33med: yeah

<bodhi_zazen> It is your channel and I was planning to be fairly hands off, with the exception of helping

<bodhi_zazen> Slow growth is IMO better then explosive growth

<paultag> I think so

<Rocket2DMn> agreed

<st33med> +103248219084502139478934569.000001

<bodhi_zazen> best provide quality support then flop because you are too busy

<paultag> but 2 - 3 people is not what we had in mind I think

<paultag> bodhi_zazen: +1

<bodhi_zazen> Well, if you hang on #ubuntu you can invite like 1 a mintue ...

<bodhi_zazen> lol

<Joeb454> paultag, I mean pull people from #ubuntu if it's not a simple 1 line answer

<paultag> heh

<paultag> ok

<bodhi_zazen> OK, forums then ?

<st33med> I would want to invite only those with bad problems bodhi_zazen

<Rocket2DMn> agreed, and please introduce those users to pastebin

<bodhi_zazen> or anything else to add to IRC ?

<paultag> yeah

<bodhi_zazen> st33med, only invite those with problems I know the answer to

<paultag> heh

<Maddeth> lol

<st33med> lol, don't know if I can with your memory loss ;)

<bodhi_zazen> hmm ...

<bodhi_zazen> I see no issues on the Forums

<bodhi_zazen> I have been impressed with the team in general and it is nice to see

<st33med> Nothing really there, not even spammers about bad commands

<Rocket2DMn> onthe topic of forums, support our man GSF - http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=747991

<chanlog> Title: For a fellow team member - Ubuntu Forums (at ubuntuforums.org)

<bodhi_zazen> We try to keep the forums clean :)

<bodhi_zazen> Launchpad team ?

<Rocket2DMn> hi

<bodhi_zazen> do we need someone to replace Toxic ?

<bodhi_zazen> Toxicity999, poke, hi

<st33med> nope, but I haven't seen him in the longest time

<paultag> heh

<bodhi_zazen> are you feeling you want to turn the Launchpad team over ?

<st33med> oh, what about bots in IRC?

<bodhi_zazen> bots on this channel ?

<paultag> st33med: launchpad now

<Rocket2DMn> bodhi_zazen, why don't we postpone the LP discussions unti lwe can get ahold of Toxicity999 

<bodhi_zazen> kk

<Joeb454> bodhi_zazen, howcome nothlit has op in here btw?

<paultag> ok

<bodhi_zazen> anyone want to talk about bots ?

<paultag> o/

<Joeb454> too many bots boil the broth

<paultag> I think so

<paultag> I have contributed to it, but I think its becoming out of hand

<bodhi_zazen> nothlit helped a great deal with this channel and the team , at first

<paultag> and if we do allow bots, then we need to keep them quiet

<Rocket2DMn> im mixed on the bots, i know they are fun, but they can be annoying esp. since they don't serve a purpose

<bodhi_zazen> he has been busy recently

<st33med> limit of two bots in #beginners-help?

<paultag> Rocket2DMn: recbot is sweet

<spiderbatdad> shit

<ajmorris> spiderbatdad: certain language creates an unintelligent atmosphere.

<Joeb454> lol

<bodhi_zazen> I say lets limit the bots to one per channel ?

<bodhi_zazen> at the most

* steambot (n=steambot@c-98-204-218-24.hsd1.va.comcast.net) has joined #ubuntuforums-beginners

<bodhi_zazen> they are fun but ...

<spiderbatdad> ^

* ajmorris has quit (Remote closed the connection)

<Joeb454> +1

<Rocket2DMn> bodhi_zazen, keep ubotu and chanlog

<paultag> Rocket2DMn: +1

<bodhi_zazen> can we have one communal bot everyone works on ?

<st33med> MINE

<paultag> I think that is resoble

<paultag> st33med: ...

<st33med> :)

<bodhi_zazen> I liked boshi_bot :)

<Joeb454> bodhi_zazen, thanks for that :)

<paultag> mine is the most feature complete :P

<paultag> bodhi_zazen: +1

<st33med> &:)

<steambot> Stop smiling at me... You look crazy when you do that.

<paultag> I say the chan bots, then one bot that we can mess with

<bodhi_zazen> OK, so I think it is agreed to tone down the bots :)

<paultag> and no joining / quiting every two seconds

<bodhi_zazen> +1 paultag

<Rocket2DMn> debug your bots elsewhere ppl

<paultag> PMs work great

<Rocket2DMn> thats basically what we're getting at

<bodhi_zazen> OK, Security team

<st33med> yes, my bot in there (as it is the least profane) and bhb

<bodhi_zazen> nothing to reoort

<bodhi_zazen> tronyx, are you wanting to be on the security team ?

<Joeb454> bhb won't leave unless I kill my server :)

<Rocket2DMn>  /bot discussions

<Joeb454> tronyx == security team lol

<paultag> heh

<paultag> tronyx: ping

<st33med> &ping | tronyx

<steambot> tronyx, Do not respond, do not respond...

<bodhi_zazen> composting team ?

<st33med> Nothing really to report

<Rocket2DMn> what is compositing team

<bodhi_zazen> OK, agenda items then ...

<bodhi_zazen> composting = decomposing thing

<st33med> Rocket2DMn, stuff like compiz

<Rocket2DMn> ok, can you make note of that on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Beginners/Team/FocusGroups/

<st33med> k

<Rocket2DMn> look at IRC and Wiki team for examples, like a oneliner at the bottom

<bodhi_zazen> OK, "training"

* chanlog` (n=channel-@220.253-201-26.VIC.netspace.net.au) has joined #ubuntuforums-beginners

<bodhi_zazen> is the team interested in training ?

* chanlog has quit (Read error: 104 (Connection reset by peer))

<bodhi_zazen> teaching ?

<paultag> to a degree

<Rocket2DMn> negative for me

<paultag> I would love to teach what I know, and learn what I dont

<bodhi_zazen> not you paultag , you would be one of the potential teachers :)

<Rocket2DMn> the IRC channle is a good place to get specific help on a topic if you dont have an answer, that essentially is 
training

<paultag> Rocket2DMn: but no, I dont think mandatory training is good

<paultag> but I think some opertunity to have people learn without having to ask is a good thing

<Rocket2DMn> we already test newcomers, so nobody here is clueless as to what's going on

<paultag> Rocket2DMn: true, but we cal all learn more

<bodhi_zazen> janquark put it on the agenda, so we should defer it to the next meeting if he did not assign a proxy

<paultag> bodhi_zazen: +1

<Rocket2DMn> we all know where to seek help on topics, and yes, we can all learn more.  i don't think training session will be 
terribly useful tho

<paultag> lets put it off till jan is here

<bodhi_zazen> I think we all learn by doing, as we go

<bodhi_zazen> you can always ask for help here and other places

<Rocket2DMn> +1 bodhi_zazen

<bodhi_zazen> OK

<paultag> it would be good to help make that curve better for new users

<st33med> Rocket2DMn, done

<paultag> ok, moving on

<spiderbatdad> havent found a good wiki on chrooting. They are full of holes

<bodhi_zazen> Rocket2DMn covered wiki pages ...

<bodhi_zazen> spiderbatdad, LOL

<Joeb454> training?

<Rocket2DMn> spiderbatdad, bodhi_zazen can help you with that

* Joeb454 is confused

<paultag> heh

<bodhi_zazen> Joeb454, It was an agenda item

<st33med> training our secret army Joeb454

<st33med> :)

<spiderbatdad> I'm just saying a good wiki subject

<Joeb454> thanks st33med

<bodhi_zazen> spiderbatdad, I can walk you through a chroot sometime

<Joeb454> lol

<bodhi_zazen> After you do it once, it is a snap really

<paultag> for sure

<st33med> what is chroot?

<bodhi_zazen> LOL

<paultag> st33med: later ill walk you through it

<spiderbatdad> i don't need the help thanks, but it took while due to lack of a good wiki

<paultag> st33med: meeting now

<st33med> OK

<bodhi_zazen> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebootstrapChroot

<chanlog`> Title: DebootstrapChroot - Ubuntu Wiki (at wiki.ubuntu.com)

<limac> well, g2g see ya huys :)

<paultag> limac: bye

<Rocket2DMn> bye limac 

<bodhi_zazen> skip to mailing list

<limac> bye

* limac (n=limac@67-132-57-14.dia.static.qwest.net) has left #ubuntuforums-beginners ("Leaving")

<bodhi_zazen> we have a mailing list, but it never took off

<paultag> ok, bodhi_zazen: what ever happend?

<bodhi_zazen> IRC seems to work best

<Rocket2DMn> bodhi_zazen, i think the problem is nobody knows where the mailing list is

<bodhi_zazen> No one really used it but nothlit and I

<paultag> heh

<paultag> ok, just wanted to bring that up

<Rocket2DMn> how do we add ourselves to it and use it

<st33med> &beginners

<steambot> This channel is meant for people who need help very badly, and don't want to go through the #ubuntu channel (Why? 
because it is crowded). The Beginners Team members are usually signified by a yellow dot or other symbol, depending on what IRC 
client you are using.

<st33med> :)

<st33med> !ping

<ubotu> ping yourself ;-) really the diodes all down my left side are sore

<bodhi_zazen> Ah

<Rocket2DMn> if we get the mailing list going again, people, please remember to use text only format in your emails

<bodhi_zazen> here is the link for the team :

<bodhi_zazen> Access is blocked - please contact your system administrator.

<bodhi_zazen> LOL

<spiderbatdad> st33med so are all ABT members, voiced on that channel?

<paultag> LOLZ0R

<bodhi_zazen> http://groups.google.com/group/ubuntuforums-beginners-team?hl=en

<Rocket2DMn> FAIL

<paultag> failboat

<st33med> !test

<ubotu> Failed.

<st33med> :)

<st33med> most, spiderbatdad

<Rocket2DMn> bodhi_zazen, is our email hidden on that mailing list

<bodhi_zazen> Last item

<Joeb454> spiderbatdad, only members of the IRC focus group are voiced in #beginners-help

<Rocket2DMn> and not posted on the web

<paultag> OK, I move to try the Mailing list again

<bodhi_zazen> paultag, team cloaks

<bodhi_zazen> Rocket2DMn, yes, I think so

<Rocket2DMn> seconded paultag 

<bodhi_zazen> I can not access the page at the moment

<paultag> alright, we can do that later

<paultag> moving on to cloaks

<Rocket2DMn> bodhi_zazen, i submitted a join request on the mailing list

<paultag> I think that we should use cloaks as well as voice to to mark a member

<spiderbatdad> bogus

<paultag> as well as putting focus member team leaders as admins

<bodhi_zazen> admins where ?

<paultag> I think this will help in #ubuntu as well as around Freenode

<Rocket2DMn> so this cloak stuff, is this for IRC? we get our own cloak?

<paultag> bodhi_zazen: hostname cloaks

<paultag> bodhi_zazen: you have one set to fluxbuntu docs

<bodhi_zazen> :)

<paultag> Rocket2DMn: anyone can get an unifileated one

<paultag> Rocket2DMn: I have one

<paultag> I think the team should have a single cloak together

<bodhi_zazen> paultag, cloaks are OK with me, perhaps for senior members of the team or team leaders

<bodhi_zazen> how do we set that up ?

* Joeb454 has a cloak

<Rocket2DMn> sounds cool

<st33med> am I senior?

<paultag> bodhi_zazen: I was thinking more one for members, and one for leaders and admins

* Joeb454 should clearly be an op too :P

<bodhi_zazen> I do not want to give a cloak to every new member, sometimes they do not stay long enough

<paultag> bodhi_zazen: ok

<st33med> how about for those with 500+beans on the forums get a cloack

<st33med> *cloak

<bodhi_zazen> LOL

<paultag> st33med: I dont have more them 500 beans

<st33med> :)

<Joeb454> st33med, does that mean I get 2 cloacks

<Joeb454> cloaks*

<paultag> I help when there is a big issue

<bodhi_zazen> paultag, do you know who to talk to about cloaks ?

<Rocket2DMn> i dont think setting a nubmer is the best approach, just leave it up to bodhi_zazen when to dish out a cloak

<paultag> bodhi_zazen: I went too #freenode for mine

<paultag> Rocket2DMn: +1

<bodhi_zazen> I like the idea of giving focus group leaders ops in this channel

<Joeb454> really?

<paultag> I think this needs an email to freenode for cloaks

<st33med> :D

<st33med> DIBS

<Joeb454> all Focus Group leaders?

<bodhi_zazen> paultag, do you want to send a email ?

<Rocket2DMn> bodhi_zazen, i only got ahold of nothlit once, im not sure if he still wants leadership of Wiki team

<Joeb454> b/c we have like 5 focus groups

<paultag> bodhi_zazen: sure, Ill take care of it

<bodhi_zazen> OK thanks

<st33med> I can has cloakz

<st33med> ?

<bodhi_zazen> Rocket2DMn, next time nothlit is here I will ask him

<paultag> I think bodhi_zazen should control cloaks

<Rocket2DMn> alright

<Joeb454> bodhi_zazen, who are the F.G ops?

<bodhi_zazen> Until then lets assume not, but not make it official until we have had a chance to talk to him ?

<Rocket2DMn> sure bodhi_zazen , no hurry

<Joeb454> me ajorris, Rocket2DMn , and then who?

<bodhi_zazen> If no appearance by next meeting we will make it official by absence

<st33med> md

<st33med> *me

<Joeb454> i thought you were

<st33med> igknighted

<st33med> ajmorris

<Rocket2DMn> who is igknighted anyway

* Joeb454 has never seen ignknighted

* Rocket2DMn has to leave in 10 minutes

<st33med> Toxicity999, DrSmall, and tronyx

<bodhi_zazen> That is what I mean by people comming and going ...

<Rocket2DMn> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Beginners/Team/FocusGroups

<Rocket2DMn> moving on

<chanlog`> Title: Beginner's Team Focus Groups - Community Ubuntu Documentation (at help.ubuntu.com)

<paultag> bodhi_zazen: this is what I will be doing with the cloaks: http://freenode.net/group_registration.shtml

<chanlog`> Title: Group Registration (at freenode.net)

<bodhi_zazen> paultag, I do not know much about cloaks, so I will be learning "on the fly"

<bodhi_zazen> I appreciate your help in this

<paultag> really feel like we are a "real" team

<paultag> on IRC that is

<bodhi_zazen> As long as it is not abused

<paultag> right

* bodhi_zazen recalls an event of cloak abuse ...

<spiderbatdad> it already is

<paultag> heh

<st33med> cloak abuse is what?

<paultag> bodhi_zazen: they will have our names on it, I dont think anyone will do anything

<paultag> st33med: raiding #windows, and posting pr0n

<bodhi_zazen> using your cloak to spam a channel ...

<st33med> paultag, that would be compiledkernels job :)

<bodhi_zazen> paultag, that too

<paultag> bodhi_zazen: it makes it hard to boot / block / ban you from a chan -- it maskes your IP

<bodhi_zazen> OK, any other agenda itmes ?

<Joeb454> IIRC freenode gets your ip anyway

<paultag> right

<bodhi_zazen> paultag, I know

<paultag> ok

<paultag> cool, thats it for me

<bodhi_zazen> the only abuse I know of is spaming ...

<Rocket2DMn> i have a topic for brief discussion

<bodhi_zazen> OK, go ro

<bodhi_zazen> Rocket2DMn,

<Joeb454> bodhi_zazen, I'm curious about this op-ing F.G leaders, but we can talk about that later if you like :)

<Rocket2DMn> The Unanswered Posts team has a website where they post threads that they respond to, at http://ua.codechunk.net/  - 
you can't view it in detail unless you're registered with them

<bodhi_zazen> FG ?

<paultag> Focus Groups

<Joeb454> bingo

<Rocket2DMn> although they use it for all threads (supposedly), i think its a useful tool for posting threads you need help with

* Joeb454 is lazy

<bodhi_zazen> OK

<Rocket2DMn> so you can flag a thread that you are unable to solve, and other members of this team can go check it out

<Joeb454> Rocket2DMn, I use it for all unanswered posts I answer :)

<bodhi_zazen> Rocket2DMn, we could make a wiki page

<bodhi_zazen> add and delete threads

<st33med> that sounds exhausting

<Rocket2DMn> that is true bodhi_zazen , its just not as convenient i think

<bodhi_zazen> Joeb454, I was thinking of giving OP to a few more folks here, I am not always here

<Rocket2DMn> people arent likely to regularly check a wiki page

<st33med> +1 Rocket2DMn

<Joeb454> bodhi_zazen, I've noticed that little fact ;)

<Rocket2DMn> anyway, i dont think it would hurt, not like it needs to be mandatory

<Rocket2DMn> ill talk to ajmorris about it and see if it can be adapted

<bodhi_zazen> +10 Rocket2DMn

<Rocket2DMn> could be an interesting thing to try out, even if we dont stick with it

<st33med> bodhi_zazen, who will you be giving level 10 status too?

<bodhi_zazen> st33med, I have not decided yet

<st33med> k

<Joeb454> st33med, chanlog ;)

<bodhi_zazen> I was thinking ajmorris, paultag , and Joeb454

* Joeb454 feels privileged...though I don't know why

<Joeb454> lol

<bodhi_zazen> Unless anyone has any other suggestions ?

<Joeb454> -1million for paultag :P

<Rocket2DMn> lol

<bodhi_zazen> If you do not want to voice them in public, /msg me

<paultag> haha

<Joeb454> lol

<st33med> ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++1

<st33med> :)

<paultag> st33med: thanks ;)

<Rocket2DMn> sounds good

<bodhi_zazen> OK, one more topic then

<bodhi_zazen> recuritment

<st33med> *recruitment

<Joeb454> lol

<bodhi_zazen> In my experience, I like to see people come to the channel and hang for a while

<paultag> ok, btw all -- cloak stuff submited to Freenode

<Joeb454> oh and bodhi_zazen I noticed you fixed the typo in your sticky

<bodhi_zazen> I do not feel we need to recruit at the moment

<Joeb454> bodhi_zazen, like Maddeth ?

<bodhi_zazen> yea, like Maddeth

<Joeb454> :)

<bodhi_zazen> Otherwise, they tend to fly by night and we never see them again

* Joeb454 likes Maddeth...partly because he understands my british humour (yes with a u)

<st33med> including the ninjas

<paultag> heh

<st33med> >.>

<bodhi_zazen> I am sure we all know team members on the list we have not seen recently

<st33med> <.<

<st33med> nothlit, Toxicity999, igknighted

* Rocket2DMn needs to leave now

<Joeb454> bodhi_zazen, actually I saw caprikori the other night

<Rocket2DMn> who is doing the minutes?

<Joeb454> see ya Rocket2DMn

<bodhi_zazen> That is what has happened, and it is OK, but at this time I prefer to recruit more stable members
