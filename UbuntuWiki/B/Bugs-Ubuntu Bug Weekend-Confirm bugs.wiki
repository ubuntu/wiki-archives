To confirm a bug '''is''' to try to reproduce it and mark it as affecting you in <nowiki>[[http://tinyurl.com/opuh8aq|Launchpad]]</nowiki>.

<nowiki>[[File:Confirm bugs.png||width=750]]</nowiki>

===  ===

'''For confirming''' a bug, just do the following:

1. '''Check the panel''' hasn't got errors that are obvious to you.
2. '''Check the bug description''' has clear steps about how the bug can be reproduced.
** '''If it hasn't''':
1. '''Set the bug status''' to "incomplete".
2. '''Ask the user''' to specify steps to recreate the bug, and to set the bug back to a status of "confirmed" when done.
3. If the description is clear enough, try to '''reproduce''' it in your Ubuntu installation.
4. If you were able to reproduce the bug, '''confirm''' it by clicking on "this bug affects 1 person. Does this bug affect you?" sentence over the panel.
** '''If you weren't''' able to reproduce it.
1. '''Tell''' you weren't by briefly explaining in which conditions you tried to.
2. '''Subscribe''' to the bug, by using the panels on the right side in the report.

* /!\ '''Before confirming''' bugs, you need to have installed <nowiki>[[http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-live/current/|Ubuntu 14.04 daily built]]</nowiki> in your machine.
** ;) But if you want to use Ubuntu 14.04 '''without having''' to modify your system so far, you can just install the <nowiki>[[http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-live/current/|daily built]]</nowiki> into the "<nowiki>[[https://www.virtualbox.org|Virtualbox]]</nowiki>" application, which is also available in the <nowiki>[[One%20Hundred%20Papercuts-The%20Ubuntu%20Software%20Center|Ubuntu Software Center]]</nowiki> (you can have a look at the <nowiki>[[http://youtu.be/FNTFDnle3Hc|video-tutorial]]</nowiki>).
* (!) If a bug report seems '''very hard''' for you to manage, you shall want to '''just ignore''' it and continue with a different one.
** ;) Alternatively you can <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QATeam/Contact|ask for guidance]]</nowiki>.
