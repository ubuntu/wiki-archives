== What is the Ubuntu Bug Weekend ==

<nowiki>[[http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000017.html|As said]]</nowiki> by Joel Spolsky, '''good software''' usually takes 10 years to become well made. Now time has arrived to Ubuntu, the most popular Linux based operating system in the world (see the <nowiki>[[http://youtu.be/8DQNzJjbZGY|video]]</nowiki>).

So the Bug Weekend '''is an event''' aimed to harden our 10th anniversary <nowiki>[[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DQNzJjbZGY|Ubuntu]]</nowiki> LTS release; and make Trusty Tahr not only the flagship of the Ubuntu Community, but the most amazing experience in computing. It is designed to have '''easy and enjoyable''' tasks which nearly everyone can take, but with a great impact in overall system quality. It is also a great '''opportunity''' for computer enthusiasts to get in touch with how the most popular libre operating system in the world is made.

Bug Week will last two days: from '''Friday 07-03''' to '''Sunday 09-03''' ( :) <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QATeam/Contact|Speak With Us!]]</nowiki>).

== Prizes ==

Additionally, for making the event more challenging, the person who contributed in more bugs in each list (what we will review for errors) will be able to choose from one of the following '''prizes''':

==== An Ubuntu Design Mug ====
