== About Me ==

I am very new to Wiki's and editing like this. I have been using computers since I was three years old and I am now 24. I have been using Linux since about 2002. And I started using Ubuntu at 4.10.

I work with people who are Deaf-Blind and we need to have an assitive technology solution for them that doesn't cost $6,000. I see Ubuntu as a way to reduce the cost of computer technology for the Deaf-Blind and make it more stable.

My first goal is to introduce as many people as posible to Ubuntu in the hopes that they will start using it and become involed in the community.

I am also going to work more on my Wiki editing skills.
