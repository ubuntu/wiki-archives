== Creating a Team Menu Bar ==

One thing you see on every page on this <nowiki>[[BuildingCommunity-SampleTeam|Sample Team]]</nowiki> is a consistent menu bar. This gives the teams pages some navigation and consistency. To do this I have created a single menu bar that is included on every team page. This way if you update the menu bar, it is shown on ''all'' the pages. :)

To do this, follow these steps:

=== Step 1: Create the menu bar ===

First create a page for the menu bar. I have done this on <nowiki>[[BuildingCommunity-SampleTeam-Header|Header]]</nowiki>. On that page is the following code:

<pre>
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <tablestyle="font-size: 0.85em; border: none; width: 100%; background-color: #f1f1ed; font-weight: bold;"> [:SampleTeam:Home]
| [:SampleTeam/Roadmap:Roadmap]
| [:SampleTeam/GettingInvolved:Getting Involved]
| [:SampleTeam/KnowledgeBase:Knowledge Base]
| [:SampleTeam/FAQ:FAQ]
| [:SampleTeam/Contacts:Contacts]
| <style="font-size: 0.80em; border: 2px; background-color: #cccccc;"> '''NEXT SAMPLETEAM MEETING''':<nowiki>[[BR]]</nowiki> Tue 9th Jan 15.00 UTC ([:SampleTeam/Meeting: details])
|}
</pre>

This code is a table with a bunch of links in it.

=== Step 2: Include the menu bar on your team pages ===

You now have the menu bar living on the <nowiki>[[BuildingCommunity-SampleTeam-Header|Header]]</nowiki> page, and just need to include it in each of your team pages. To do this, add this code to the top of every team page:

<pre>
<nowiki>[[Include(BuildingCommunity-SampleTeam-Header)]]</nowiki>
</pre>

You will now see the menu bar appear.

If you want to make changes to the menu bar that appear on all pages, just edit <nowiki>[[BuildingCommunity-SampleTeam-Header|Header]]</nowiki> and thats it! Simple!
