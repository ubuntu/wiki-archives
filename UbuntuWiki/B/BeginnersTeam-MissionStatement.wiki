== Our Mission Statement ==
The Ubuntu Beginners Team exists to enhance the initial experience of new Ubuntu users and to guide existing Ubuntu users to become part of the global Ubuntu community. We also want to inspire these users to stay aboard and give back to the community by enhancing and educating the new upcoming users.

== Background ==
The Beginners Team is a community of volunteers dedicated to assisting new users and helping them share that knowledge through community participation. Team members contribute to many areas of the community through the Teams Focus Groups. Our groups cover as many areas of the community as possible. We strive to provide diligent, gracious, and reliable guidance to new users. Compassionate assistance to new users not only eases the initial transition to a new operating system, but is the driving force behind the popularity of Ubuntu.
