Ben has been a (if not the) driving force behind Ubuntu Oregon. He's been putting many hours toward getting our team official status, he was at our booth at OSCON all week, talking to people about Ubuntu and rounding up support for the local team. His constantly positive attitude is great to have around. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:thefinn93]]</nowiki> 2011-10-17 17:01:39

I met Ben at OSCON when we staffed the Ubuntu booth together this year. I was inspired by his energy and willingness to ask for and leverage resources for Oregon LoCo. I look forward to working with him on joint projects (Oregon and Washington) again. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:valorie-zimmerman]]</nowiki> 2011-10-17 17:01:39

In the short time I have been in the Ubuntu Oregon LoCo team, from what I have seen, Ben has been a pivotal part of team, a key player. He did a good job keeping the Global Jam running smoothly, and he shares his advice with those who would ask it. he spends a lot of his time contributing to the team, and making sure the team runs smoothly. --  <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:cody.smith]]</nowiki> 2011-10-17 17:01:39

Ben Kerensa has been instrumental in getting the Ubuntu Oregon LoCo team active again. After I left the states, activity dropped; no one seemed to have the time or energy to organise events and manage the group. Currently, Oregon LoCo Team more active than ever, due largely to Ben's dedication and efforts. As a former Ubuntu Community Member, I would strongly recommend Ben for membership. He is an avid Ubuntu advocate who is technically proficient and great at communicating. I find him inspirational and look forward to working with him in the future to help take Ubuntu Oregon LoCo Team to new heights. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:dan.smith]]</nowiki> 2011-10-17 17:01:39

Through a series of interesting events- I found myself living in California and also the acting lead of Ubuntu Oregon. Finding a lead was hard to do. I wanted to find a person with at least a few important skills for the task. When Ben volunteered to help coordinate with OSCON -- it soon became very obvious he had all sorts of the needed skills. Not to mention bonus things as well. 

He is very personable and likes people, the sort of thing that fits well in Ubuntu's Circle of Friends. His networking and publicity abilities are second to none. Hopefully he is able to share this not only with Oregon Team- but, with Ubuntu and FOSS in general. Ben is a great asset for Open Source in the Pacific North West, and for the Ubuntu project {*} <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:tuxwings.org| Mark Terranova]]</nowiki>

Benjamin Kerensa has made a tremendous impression in the time I've known him. His involvement and leadership in the Ubuntu Oregon Loco make it real. Ben has demonstrated a solid commitment to the goals of promoting and representing Ubuntu in the community with dignity and good humor, and is engaging and easy to work with. He is a tremendous promoter, with the business savvy to engage local tech companies with hosting events and contributing promotional and financial support. Ben is the type of person who would be an asset to any group that depends on the sustained involvement of its members for survival, and many other groups besides! :) -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:nathwill]]</nowiki> 2011-10-17 21:41:39
