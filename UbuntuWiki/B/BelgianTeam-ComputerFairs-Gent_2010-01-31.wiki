'''Report'''

Most participants arrived at the fair at 9 o'clock, which gave us enough time to setup the booth properly. The following people manned the booth for the whole event: Kenneth, Pieter, Joris DV, Joris DW, Manuel, Christopher, Pieter and Mike. As you can see in the pictures our booth looked very nice. The booth was correctly decorated with flyers, A4 and A3 stands. We have also received a big screen from Guy (Duportail) which has been added to the Ghent event box. 2 of our laptops and the PC where permanently used to burn ubuntu/kubuntu CD's. The remaining hardware was used to demo applications and use cases to the visitors.

Between 10 and 11h30 we were all busy talking with visitors about Ubuntu and addressing questions. In the afternoon it was _very_ quiet and most exhibitors started cleaning up near 16h. As usual, we had a few "regulars". From my perception, we did not meet a lot of new people and since the fair was very quiet, we only distributed around 50 CD's.

To conclude I want to express some of my thoughts, that are probably shared by some of the participants, on future events:
*** For the moment we try to attend _all_ the Dipro events. Not all of them, however, receive a lot of visitors (not sure why though). Maybe we should skip events every now and then.
*** I have the impression seeing the same people, event after event (I am sure all participants, including past participants can concur). Not all of them are positive about Ubuntu and not all of them are posing Ubuntu/Linux related questions. This can be annoying sometimes and is not easy for the participants.
*** Not all Ghent events have a positive revenue. Now that Shipit has stopped providing free CD's, participants have to pay for the CD's they're distributing themselves. If you add up all the costs (CD's, booth fee, ...) there is a negative balance this time. We need a cheaper way to be able to provide free CD's to the visitors.
