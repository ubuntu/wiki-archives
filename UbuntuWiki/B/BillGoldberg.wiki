__TOC__

Hello.

I'm a 21 year old male from Belgian.

I'm active on the ubuntuforums.org, am a member of the Belgian Ubuntu team and have my own ubuntu related blog on linuxowns.wordpress.com .

Besides that, I enjoy a good football match (soccer) match with friends and like any other 21 year old I enjoy the occasional visit to the pub.
