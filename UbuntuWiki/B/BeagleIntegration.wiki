Specification on the integration of beagle into the Ubuntu desktop for Edgy Eft.
This will require seeding beagle, beagle-backend-evolution.

The installer will need to allow for making user_xattr a default boot option on at least /home. user_xattr does not apply to xfs file systems, where xattr is "always on".

Integration with Nautilus and Yelp is already enabled for Dapper. There may be room for aditional polish or integration with other areas of the desktop. Much of this work is being done in SuSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 10.

==== Comments ====
''MikkelKamstrupErlandsen'' - This relates a lot to the IntegratedDesktopSearch spec
''KevinKubasik'' - Forall intents and purposes, it has been merged.
