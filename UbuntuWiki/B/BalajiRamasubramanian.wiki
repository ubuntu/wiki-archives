Welcome to my page on Ubuntu's community wiki pages. 

I am an electrical engineer and aspire to take graduate courses in electrical engineering, majoring in semiconductor device physics. Currently I am working in the industry as a senior physical design engineer. 

I began using Ubuntu Linux when I needed a Linux platform to do all my research work as a student. 

I first installed Ubuntu Linux on my own laptop - HP Compaq V6102AU. I have a page on the laptop testing category on this model of the Laptop and I am directing people on how to use the different features of the laptop on Ubuntu. 

If you have any direct questions to ask me, here is my email: balaji dot ramasubramanian at gmail dot com.
