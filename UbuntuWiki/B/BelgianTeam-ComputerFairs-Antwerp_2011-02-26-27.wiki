'''Report'''

The Hobby and Computersdays were pretty busy. 
Saturday we were with six volunteers constantly working to provide explanations.
Sunday we were originally with five, later by four, even more active, but unlike Saturday, from 16:00 Sunday was much less interest.

The collaboration with C & T computer club was positive. We have made good use their excess space.
WiFi was available from the HCC-NL position, although the connection is lost several times. For searches e.d.m. however, it was workable, in order to download the latest slideshow. 
This presentation was continuously projected via a beamer (thanks Hugo).
A server with various ISO files was available.

For our active help in installing Ubuntu on a Compaq Evo Notebook we were rewarded with a CD spindle, which was very useful (both the original and the first spindle of 50 had already been distributed).

'''Finances''' 

Incomes: 5 t-shirts +75,00€, 1 strip metallic stickers +2,50€, public gifts 142,60 €. 
Expenditures: 1 CD box -12,99€. 
Saldo: 207.11 € for Ubuntu-be

'''Lessons learned: what can we improve next year ?'''

An initial stock of 50 cd's per day (originals or copies) is a minimum.

Installation of the booth can on Saturday 08.30 hr.

4 volunteers per day is a minimum.
