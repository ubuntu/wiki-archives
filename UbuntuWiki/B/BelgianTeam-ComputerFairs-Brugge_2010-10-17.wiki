'''Report'''

The fair was a successfull event. 

The booth was located close to the Food & Drink facilities. It was 6 m. lenght (= 3 tables 2 m.) for the price of 4 m. and enough depth to set up the booth in U-form. A fourth table was delivered by Dipro on request. 

It was easy to attract visitors to our “Ubuntu-space” for more explanations and to fix their attention on demonstrations. 

With 5 volunters in the morning, the team was able to answer to the visitors.

A continuous presentation and several videos were used on a laptop+beamer+screen+Audio-set.

3 to 5 laptops were available for explanation and demonstrations (1 with an additional 17" LCD screen). 
1 old PC was used to burn CD's.

No WiFi available. 

We distributed approximately 80 cd's, 10.04LTS and 10.10.

For a more visible promotion of the booth, we should use a support for a banner, higher than 2 m. 

  Finance :

- total of public gifts = 90,71 euros,

- charges : booth-fee (38 euros),

- benefit : 52,71 euros for Ubuntu-be.
