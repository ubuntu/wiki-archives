We would like to apply for a package set for packages related to the Bazaar version control system, with the following packages in the set:

* bzr
* bzr-svn
* bzr-git
* bzr-grep
* bzr-hg
* bzr-gtk
* qbzr
* bzr-cvsimport
* bzr-dbus
* bzr-email
* bzr-explorer
* bzr-fastimport
* bzr-loom
* bzr-pqm
* bzr-rewrite
* bzr-search
* bzr-stats
* bzr-upload
* bzr-xmloutput
* bzrtools

There are currently two per package uploaders (MartinPool, JelmerVernooij) who have upload access to at least these packages; more might apply in the future.
