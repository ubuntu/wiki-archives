Bug importances '''are''' the priorities given to a bug report in <nowiki>[[http://tinyurl.com/qzj5grt|Launchpad]]</nowiki> to be worked on by each project involved.

* <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-bugcontrol|Ubuntu Bug Control]]</nowiki> sets importance for the Ubuntu project.
* The '''rest of projects''' use their own scale for importances, so their set priorities can be different.
