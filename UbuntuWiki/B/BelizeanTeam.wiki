Our goal is to offer Belizean users a less intimidating support group, as well as promote the adoption of Ubuntu at home in Belize. 

=== Reasons to Become a Member ===
* Ubuntu-BZ is a local effort for Belizeans, and by Belizean, and as such it will offer a smaller and less intimidating support group for members. 
* We will have a wide range of support option for new users. Including Forums, IRC, Mailing lists, Wiki,  and perhaps others yet to come.
* We plan to hook into all of the Belizean User in Belize so the BelizeanTeam will be a great way for you to see just how large the Belizean Linux community is, and then enable you to join it.
* We plan to also host links to any Belizean businesses that are Linux friendly.
* We need '''your''' help, each member has the potential to add to this community in a positive way. Through new and interesting ideas as well as technical know-how and just general positive attitudes. Together we can make a difference.

=== Why Does Ubuntu Belize exist? ===

Q: What is the point of a Local group for Belize? English is already very well supported.

A: This is actually a good thing, because while many teams need to struggle with translation issues we do not. Instead, we can focus our efforts on the next logical step which is promotion and community building on a local scale.
