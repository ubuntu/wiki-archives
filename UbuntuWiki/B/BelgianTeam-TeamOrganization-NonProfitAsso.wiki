=== This page was created for a brain-storming about the creation of a non-profit association (v.z.w. or a.s.b.l.) in support of Ubuntu-be ===
Please feel free to contribute to the discussion on this topic.
=== Basic ===
Association "Ubuntu-Belgium" is a non-profit association created by active members of the Belgian LoCo Team (Ubuntu-be) in accordance with the Belgian legal rules. 
The aim of the association is to support and represent the to support the Belgian LoCo Team.

 <nowiki>[[http://www.just.fgov.be/img_justice/publications/pdf/64.pdf|information in Dutch]]</nowiki> - French version exists

=== Implications ===
** The association has to follow the legal rules!
** It needs a few motivated volunteers to start with and the support of other volunteers for a rotation of responsibilities/tasks in the future. 
=== Pro and contra arguments ===

** Proposition: 
*** The association should represent and support the Belgian Ubuntu Local Community Team in legal and public relations matters. 
*** The association will participate to the coordination of events and activities in close relation with the leading members of Ubuntu-be.
*** Active members of Ubuntu-be could create a non-profit association. It should include a board (a few key posts, secretary, treasurer, administrators with specific responsibilities, official Ubuntu LoCo Team contact) with a mandate of 1 or 2 years. 

** Pro: a legal status means legal existence and legal protection for members acting within the framework of the association. Possibility to have an bank-account as non-profit association. Possibility of insurance for our activities. Management of the Ubuntu-be assets (material). Tasks and responsibilities can be clearly shared between a few members.

** Contra: it needs a group of reliable members for a rotation of responsibilities and tasks. Administrative procedures to be followed. Regular meetings in real life of all members (yearly general assembly) have to be organized. A few costs (limited).

** Difficulties: 
*** How can we define the Belgian Ubuntu Community? (mailing list, LoCo Team, active members, ...)
*** How can the relation be organized between the Belgian Ubuntu community (=readers of the mailing list), the Belgian Local Community Team (in launchpad, possibly organized with a leading council) and the association?
*** Are there enough reliable members?  10 could be a minimum, but not too much for practical reason. Rules and conditions to join the association? (initially election, later cooptation?) 
*** Need to write statutes and publish it via legal procedure. Legal location for the association? Location of the association implicates the of 1 official language for legal procedures.
