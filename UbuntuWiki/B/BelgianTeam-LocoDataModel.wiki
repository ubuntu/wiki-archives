__TOC__

I am currently abusing Dia to produce a more or less working entity relationship diagram of the Belgian team.

* <nowiki>[[File:LocoTeamERD.png]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[attachment:LocoTeamERD.dia]]</nowiki>

=== Comments ===
* We can extract the "Person" entity type.
** A Volunteer ISA Person
** A Shop_Employee ISA Person
** A Person HAS
** An email (id)
** A first-name
** A last-name
** An address
** A password
** A phone-number
** A jabber id [0-1]
* We can extract the "Addres" entity type.
** An addres HAS
** A street name (+number)
** A Postcode
** A City name
** Postcode and city name are related and there is a set of legal value for these two "attribute".

I don't like it, but for readabiliy and given the lack of good free ER(A) tools we should probably use a UML Class diagram. --PierreBuyle
