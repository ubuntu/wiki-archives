=== Stuff needed ===

==== Electronics ====
* RoelHuybrechts: I can bring my laptop, Acer Aspire 1692; I'll provide it with a fresh Dapper install by then
* Pieter : When its really needed, I can bring my desktop computer
* StijnLeenknegt can bring his computer, with beryl, but without the screen. Can anyone bring an extra screen?
* RoelHuybrechts: According to <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-be/2007-January/002049.html|this]]</nowiki> message, MichelDaggelinckx can also bring a computer, with an nVidia card, so maybe capable of running Beryl
* MichelDaggelinckx can bring 1 pc with a fresh Edgy install

==== Other ====
* Lots of pressed cd's
** RoelHuybrechts: I can bring a few (6 or so..) shipit Dapper cd's
** StevenLemmens: Maybe we should put out a couple of orders each, because maybe not all orders arrive on time, but one of them does. Perhaps an order of 100 CD's each, and each time mention that it's for the fair of Antwerp (24/25 february)? They will probably get approved that way, and they may be sent faster? Even if only one of the orders arrive in time, then we will at least have CD's to hand out. That way the risk is somewhat spread out more.

* Apparently, there is a lot of promotional material at Leuven, like pressed CD's, banners, etc. Pieter will bring everything from Mechelen to Antwerp Expo. JanC will transport the goods to Pieter. 

=== Mini network ===

Pieter is bringing his wifi router (wifi + 4 ports network switch, we need a cable for Stijns' computer), so that creates possibilities. I propose to set up an unsecured wifi network (hotspot), so everyone who opens up his laptop will autoconnect to it. Then we make sure all the traffic gets to one pc with apache + very simple page where Ubuntu cd images can be downloaded.

* RoelHuybrechts: I will prepare the html page, and get some more info about arranging the traffic shape thing
* Roel Huybrechts: I will also bring following .iso's:
** Ubuntu Dapper Desktop
** Ubuntu Dapper Alternate
** Ubuntu Edgy Desktop
** Ubuntu Edgy Alternate
** Xubuntu Edgy Desktop
** Xubuntu Edgy Alternate
** Xubuntu Dapper Desktop
* For easy connection of the different pc's in order to share .iso's for example, can anyone who brings his pc also bring a UTP networking cable please.
* Pieter: I'll bring the following iso's:
** Xubuntu Dapper Alternate
** The 4 kubuntu iso's

=== IRC meetings ===
I propose to have a few irc meetings with the participants in order to arrange things practically. These dates are proposals, if it doesn't fit, please change/add. Meetings will be held in #ubuntu-be at irc.freenode.net

* fri 23/2, 8 pm

=== Comments ===

Day 1 was GREAT!!!
We had nearly finished setting up shop and already two people came to us saying they ran Ubuntu at home! During the day, we've had dozens of people coming by and saying they used Ubuntu. Sometimes they asked questions when they couldn't get something to work and when we could we helped them or else referred them to our extensive Wiki's and our forum. We were really quite amazed that there are THAT many Ubuntu-users out there.
The pressed CD's (Edgy Eft, Dapper Drake) were gone like tissues at a snot party before we knew it. We didn't hand them out, though, we waited for the people to actually ask us about them. A lot of people were aware of the existence of "Live-technology", which made explaining it all a lot easier.

Throughout the day we kept answering their questions and we're sure that we're responsible for a lot of new members now. I personally heard the words "because it's not Microsoft" quite a lot of times.

In the afternoon, there was one booth that felt necessary to preview Vista (while selling Linux Mandriva), Ubuntu and Mandriva. I wasn't there, but it appears that Vista actually crashed during the presentation.
Way to go!

Sometime in the afternoon, we also found a booth that was actually selling Ubuntu CD's (self-burned) for € 10 each. We felt compelled to ask him about this, but there wasn't really anything we could do. After all, he's not asking for money for the operating system, but for the disc it's on, really.

  There is no restriction on selling the Ubuntu operating system; if someone wants to pay you 1 million for a copy of Ubuntu, just take the money (and donate some of it to Ubuntu-be of course ;) ). -- JanClaeys

  You're right Jan. I wrote "there wasn't really anything he could do", by mistake. It should have been "anything WE could do".
