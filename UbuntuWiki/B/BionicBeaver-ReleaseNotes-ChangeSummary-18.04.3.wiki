__TOC__


This is a brief summary of bugs fixed between Ubuntu 18.04.2 and 18.04.3.  '''This summary covers only changes to packages in ''__main__'' and ''__restricted__'', which account for all packages in the officially-supported CD images; there are further changes to various packages in ''universe'' and ''multiverse''.'''  Some of these fixes were by Ubuntu developers directly, while others were by upstream developers and backported to Ubuntu.  For full details, see the individual package changelogs.

In addition to the bugs listed below, this update includes all security updates from the <nowiki>[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/releases/ubuntu-18.04-lts/|Ubuntu Security Notice list]]</nowiki> affecting Ubuntu 18.04 LTS that were released up to and including August 1, 2019.  The last update included was USN-4079-2 (SoX vulnerabilities).

=== Installation bug fixes ===

Updated CD images are provided with this release, including fixes for some installation bugs.  (Many installation problems are hardware-specific; for those, see "Hardware support bugs" below.)

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| parted
| Bug:1820090
| debian/patches/fix-windows-fat-recognition-after-resizing.patch: Apply upstream patch to fix FAT resizing so that FAT filesystems which are resized by libparted are recognizeable in Microsoft Windows.
|-
| livecd-rootfs
| Bug:1800610
| Minimize the number of manually installed packages in images by marking dependencies of metapackages as automatically installed. But do not mark direct dependencies of ubiquity as auto installed. This caused cryptsetup to remain auto on the installed system in bionic
|-
| console-setup
| Bug:1824227
| setupcon: use /run for tempfiles (and dump the various unnecessary fallback paths), since /run is always mountable rw at least as early as /tmp is and is guaranteed to be safe from tmpcleaners at boot.  Only keep /tmp as a fallback in case we have access to write to /tmp and to a console, but not to /run.
|-
| language-selector
| Bug:1823461
| fontconfig/69-language-selector-ja.conf: Refer to font family more precisely, to prevent that rendering using other fonts is affected unintentionally
|-
| console-setup
| Bug:520546
| Call setupcon --force only when debian-installer is active and always redirect output to /dev/null to not block.
|-
| livecd-rootfs
| Bug:1826377
| Remove crufty files after minimize-manual
|-
| curtin
| Bug:1817964
| New upstream snapshot.
|-
| livecd-rootfs
| Bug:1828118
| Backport two minimizations for the docker images: remove apt lists that are removed downstream anyway, and remove device nodes from the image.
|-
| livecd-rootfs
| Bug:1827357
| Subiquity specific changes SRU
|-
| debconf
| Bug:1822270
| Fix readline prompts when run via run-parts
|-
| livecd-rootfs
| Bug:1829333
| Strip translation files out of the minimal images, another thing that goes unused when there is no human console user (and we already don't have the locales themselves present on a minimal image).
|-
| livecd-rootfs
| Bug:1831675
| Backport improvements to snap seeding from trunk.
|-
| curtin
| Bug:1831757
| d/control: drop probert dependency, not yet in main
|-
| curtin
| Bug:1831772
| New upstream snapshot.
|-
| livecd-rootfs
| Bug:1828500
| Do proper error checking when calling snap-tool info to determine the base of a snap.
|-
| livecd-rootfs
| Bug:1836594
| Seed core for non minimized builds, as it is still required

=== Upgrade bug fixes ===

These changes fix upgrade issues, smoothing the way for future upgrades to later releases of Ubuntu.

|-
| unattended-upgrades
| Bug:1795696
| do_auto_remove() is successful unless a commit() operation fails
|-
| unattended-upgrades
| Bug:1820888
| Compare apt.package.Version objects and not the versions' string representation. This prevented adjusting candidates when the strings sorted differently. Also extend tests to catch issue.
|-
| unattended-upgrades
| Bug:1821101
| Fall back to adjusting more packages' candidates when a package from an allowed origin can't be marked to install/upgrade.
|-
| update-manager
| Bug:1823410
| UpdateManager/Core/utils.py: when testing to see if a url is downloadable support https in addition to http and ftp.
|-
| ubuntu-release-upgrader
| Bug:1822886
| DistUpgradeController.py: Instead of checking every sources.list entry to see if they are accessible keep track of the uris and only test once per uri thereby preventing situations where entries for the same server are enabled and disabled.
|-
| ubuntu-release-upgrader
| Bug:1823410
| debian/control: build depend on the new version of update-manager which supports checking to see if an https url is downloadable.
|-
| distro-info-data
| Bug:1825379
| Add Ubuntu 19.10 Eoan EANIMAL.
|-
| distro-info-data
| Bug:1825553
| Correct EOL dates for trusty

| Detect changes to moved conffiles
|-
| unattended-upgrades
| Bug:1823872
| Detect unchanged moved conffiles. When a package moves a conffile properly without any change no conffile prompt needs to be shown thus the package can be upgraded unattended.
|-
| unattended-upgrades
| Bug:1821103
| Skip sending email when no package had to be installed, upgraded or removed (Closes: #924554)
|-
| unattended-upgrades
| Bug:1824341
| Make sure autoremovals don't start with a dirty cache and remove other packages
|-
| unattended-upgrades
| Bug:1824341
| Continue applying minimal sets when one set can't be marked for upgrade. Thanks to Anderson Luiz Alves for the patch, it needed minor modifications
|-
| unattended-upgrades
| Bug:1824876
| Stop raising NoAllowedOriginError when marking packages to upgrade/install fails
|-
| unattended-upgrades
| Bug:1824804 Bug:1824949
| Adjust only transitive dependencies in the fallback when a package from an allowed origin can't be marked to install/upgrade. This is a much lighter approach than marking every upgradable package because the full fallback was triggered on packages held back as well, using an excessive amount of CPU time. Also it crashed with packages not having any version in allowed origins.
|-
| unattended-upgrades
| Bug:1824804
| Skip trying to upgrade held packages in call_adjusted()
|-
| unattended-upgrades
| Bug:1825886
| Don't crash collecting transitive dependencies when package has no candidate
|-
| unattended-upgrades
| Bug:1826157
| Use mark_install_adjusted() in rewind_cache() The original cache had packages marked with adjustments thus rewinding should also do adjustments to reach the same state. Also not using mark_install_adjusted() crashes when apt raises error on held packages.
|-
| ubuntu-release-upgrader
| Bug:1828072
| data/DistUpgrade.cfg.xenial: update KernelRemoval sections to kernel packages that appear in Ubuntu 16.04.
|-
| ubuntu-release-upgrader

| DistUpgrade/DistUpgradeViewNonInteractive.py: when responding to a conffile prompt with "n" use bytes not a string.
|-
| ubuntu-release-upgrader
| Bug:1824866
| debian/control: add an explicit python3-distro-info dependency to python3-distupgrade as it is now required by DistUpgradeController.

| d3d4703] Start vgauth before vmtoolsd. VGAuthService needs to be ready when vmtoolsd runs. Certain cases - e.g. Site Recovery Manager failover - will need vgauth to be up. Therefore add an After=vgauth.service dependency to open-vm-tools.service To have vgauth be able start early - and not pull cloud-init back late - it is also required to drop default dependencies which according to VMware is fine to do so.
