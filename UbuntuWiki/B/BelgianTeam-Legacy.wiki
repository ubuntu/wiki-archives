== Belgian Team Legacy Reporting Page ==

Welcome to the Belgian Team legacy reporting page. Below you'll be able to find all activities for the past years.
 
A few guidelines for how to write good points here:

* Keep it simple and short - single sentences are best. :)
* Try to summarize your work and not be over-detailed - we don't need to know specifics, just a summary of the kind of work involved
* Where possible, include relevant links.
