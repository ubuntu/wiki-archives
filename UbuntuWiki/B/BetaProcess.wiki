__TOC__

To be carried out by the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-release|Ubuntu release team]]</nowiki> and flavor release team managers.

Goals:

* Produce a set of well-tested distribution media images suitable for broad testing by advanced users.
* Allow all packages in main to be test-built and bugs filed where relevant.
* Confirm that certified hardware is properly supported.
* Keep the developer community informed about the status of the release.

During the whole process:

* Check if there are newsworthy items and mail them to `ubuntu-devel`.  Examples of newsworthy items are: New candidate ISOs, important bugfixes (and ask for verification of same).
