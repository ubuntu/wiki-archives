=== Summary ===

Ubuntu's default home page for Firefox and Epiphany will be changed to `http://start.ubuntu.com/`, and the default bookmarks will be altered to include information accurate for Ubuntu.

=== Rationale ===

When you install Firefox or Epiphany for Ubuntu, its default home page is <nowiki>[[file:///usr/share/ubuntu-artwork/home/index.html|a local file full of boring text]]</nowiki>:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <style="border: none; background-color: #ddd; color: #000;">My only other cosmetic gripe would be the default web browser home page. It is pretty ugly and scary as well since its a solid page of small text text text. In fact more than a single screen of text. You've got to scroll to read all the fine print. Confusing and technical and fairly ugly text.
|-
| <) style="border: none; background-color: #ddd; color: #000;">''-- <nowiki>[[http://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2005-September/010499.html|Pete Shinners]]</nowiki>''
|}

Epiphany's default bookmarks are confusing:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <style="border: none; background-color: #ddd; color: #000;">The epiphany "bookmarks bar" shows no bookmarks, only a "Search the web" entry box. What can I do with it? Is there similar functionality to the firefox bookmarks toolbar where I can define my own bookmark buttons and menus?
|-
| <) style="border: none; background-color: #ddd; color: #000;">''-- <nowiki>[[http://mail.gnome.org/archives/epiphany-list/2005-October/msg00118.html|Raul Acevedo]]</nowiki>''
|}

And Firefox's default bookmarks link to plugins that don't actually work in Ubuntu.

We can do better.

=== Use cases ===

* Sally, an ex-windows user, is greeted by a giant page of text upon opening her browser. She doesn't understand this.

* Corey wants to let more people know about help.ubuntu.com and get more docteam members.

* Jeff wants more people to know about the cool things happening in Ubuntu.

=== Scope ===

* Home page
* Bookmarks menu
* Bookmarks Bar

Out of scope:
* CA certificates
* default browser chrome

=== Design ===

==== Home page ====

===== Comparisons =====

Modern dedicated Web browsers have useful default home pages that let you search the Web.
* mozilla.org Firefox: <nowiki>[[http://www.google.com/firefox|Firefox Start]]</nowiki>
* gnome.org Epiphany: <nowiki>[[http://www.google.com/|Google]]</nowiki>
* Internet Explorer: <nowiki>[[http://www.msn.com/|MSN]]</nowiki>
* Safari: <nowiki>[[http://apple.netscape.com/|Netscape.com (Apple edition)]]</nowiki>
* Opera: <nowiki>[[http://portal.opera.com/|Opera Search]]</nowiki>

===== Ubuntu =====

The default home page for Firefox and Epiphany will be `http://start.ubuntu.com/`. If we decide to change the effective default later on, we can do that by setting up a redirect.

What is presented on this site is yet to be decided, but it should:
* be useful
* not steal focus from the URL field
* provide links to local (GeoIP-detected) Ubuntu resources
* not slow people down by discouraging them from the browser's/OS's toolbar Web search.

Possible elements include:
* a feed from the fridge
* a link to help
* a link to participate.

==== Bookmarks ====

The default bookmarks should also be (a) useful, and (b) a subtle hint to how to use bookmark folders (Firefox) or topics (Epiphany).

===== Comparisions =====

Vanilla Firefox has "Quick Searches" and "Firefox & Mozilla Links" folders in its Bookmarks menu, including links to pages of plugins that don't work in Ubuntu. In its Bookmarks Toolbar it has "Firefox Help", "Firefox Support", and "Plug-in FAQ".

Vanilla Epiphany defaults to six empty topics in its Bookmarks menu, which looks broken, and a search field in its Bookmarks Bar, which is confusing:

===== Ubuntu =====

The Bookmarks Bar should include these items:
* Ubuntu.com (http://ubuntu.com/)
  - possibly remove this if space isn't there
* Ubuntu Help (http://help.ubuntu.com/)
* Forums (http://ubuntuforums.org/) 
* The Fridge (http://fridge.ubuntu.com/)
* Participate (http://ubuntu.com/community/participate/)

=== Implementation ===

Do these things early in the cycle to get good feedback.

==== Bookmarks ====

* Remove existing FF bookmarks
* On the FF quick launch bar, remove the current buttons and add the above.

==== Start.ubuntu.com ====

* Look to community to get a good layout, possibly including a design contest.

=== Outstanding issues ===

* Can the bookmarks be localized?
** If not, I'd suggest adding a link to support for all languages http://www.ubuntulinux.org/support/supportoptions/local/ (the page needs improving, as with all of the website, but it might be a start) -- <nowiki>[[mdke]]</nowiki>
