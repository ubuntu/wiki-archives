'''Report'''

I (Lars) arrived there around 9AM, Hans was already there. He brought the AluPc’s with him and his beamer. Jan en Koen arrived a little later. Jan brought his Netbook and Laptop, Koen his netbook. Thanks for that. Although I think we where quite on time, we didn’t work fast enough or something, we where still building the stand when the first people came in, although they where a bit early. 

During the fair we had a lot of different people. Elder people who are very interested in ubuntu, because they have older hardware and tried Vista, but obviously that failed. The only problem is that they are unsure if them can do it by themselves. Then we suggested the support points, and they did look but there aren’t enough for Limburg. I think there are around five now.

Then there where the youngster, I call them the “Gaming-generation”. They don’t believe in Ubuntu and in Open-Source because they think it sucks. Well they think it sucks because you can’t run all games on it. Then we explain that this is the fault of MS, but I don’t think this is the generation we need to focus on.
Then the people between there where very different opinions. Some already used it and where not very fond of it. 

Then when you ask what version they go back to 7.10 or even 6.06. Then we explained that this is a new version with lot of added hardware compatibility and we convinced them of trying it again. Other people used it from 7.10 until 10.04 and say that it has everything they need, what is just fantastic.  Some other people are just rude and say that Ubuntu sucks, and Debian is better. But then you explain that ubuntu is based on Debian, they don’t know what to say anymore. And off course there are people who use Red Hat and Fedora alike distribution with RPM. They believe in Linux and OSS, just not in Ubuntu yet.

Most of the people where very generous with donating. Although there are also people who just take the cd’s and walk away. Overall I think it was a good fair and a very good first experience for me.  Thanks to Jan, Koen and Hans for helping on the fair and to AluPc for the computers we could use.
