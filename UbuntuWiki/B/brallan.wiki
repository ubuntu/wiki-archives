== About Me ==
I am a 34 year old retiree. In addition to preparing the occasional page for the ubuntu wiki, I am involved in a squatted <nowiki>[[http://www.canmasdeu.net/|social center]]</nowiki> in Barcelona: 

=== My interest in Ubuntu ===
I first tried Ubuntu in December 2005. I was learning to program in python and decided to move to linux to be more productive. There are still a few things I have to use XP for, but all in all Ubuntu is an improvement. It is wonderful to participate in an egalitarian community of users. I also feel that intellectual property rights are wrongs, that we should share what we know, especially when it does not take anything from you to give information.
