__TOC__

I'm from Limal, in Belgium, and I'm also known under the (rather complicated, I agree...) nickname "Grungi Ankhfire".

I've been a Linux enthousiast for several years now, and since I've discovered Ubuntu, it has been my favorite distribution. I'm currently studying Applied Mathematics, and have a strong interest in programming and music.
