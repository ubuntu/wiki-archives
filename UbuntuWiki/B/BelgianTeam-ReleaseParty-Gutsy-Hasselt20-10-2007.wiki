=== Report ===

10.30 The last preparations were done: internet connections tested, seats for the presentation in the main hall set in place to welcome a maximum of 75 interested people, in the kitchen some members of the computer club were preparing the snacks …

10.50 The first 2 persons arrive at the Party; more then 2 hours before the official start of the party. They where immediately entertained when Knightwise came in to have a video interview with me. Chretien, the president of the Bitmappers, was also invited to join us in front of the camera.

12.00 The first Ubuntero’s arrive, they promised to come early. At the entrance Fabian, the vice-president of the Bitmappers, gave everyone a sticker with their name on. Ubuntero’s got a sticker with the Ubuntu logo, Computer club members one with the Bitmappers logo. This way everybody could easily see the difference between a beginner and the more experienced Ubuntero’s. This was a big success.

12.30 The crowd now starts coming in by great numbers.

13.00 Almost all seats are occupied, so the President of the Bitmappers asked me if I could already start my presentation “Introduction into Linux and Ubuntu” … it was due to be held at 14.00 …

13.30 Despite it was my first presentation ever - and for a full house - I managed to keep my nerves under control, make some little jokes … 

14.00 Done … I even received a little applause. I went outside to have a drink and a smoke. Fabian told me there were already 100 persons at the party. Well above the maximum of 75 we predicted. The people were invited to bring their laptop or PC so we could help them with the installation. 23 people did! Because we were well above our maximum capacity the 2 rooms with internet connection were filled with people.

21 PC's and laptops were successfully installed. Only 2 went home without Ubuntu. People were amazed at how easy the installation went, that all their hardware was recognized immediately, that even their digital camera was recognized out-of-the-box … People gathered before the laptops and PC's which had Compiz and were impressed by the possibilities of Compiz-Fusion.

16.30 A presentation about the live-CD, what you can do with it and how it can save your data

16.45 A presentation about Ubuntu Gutsy Gibbon, how to install software, look at the menu’s, etc …

17.00 The last presentation was given about the possibilities of Compiz-Fusion and what’s new in Gutsy by Wesley Stessens. I would like to thank him for this because he had only one day to prepare his presentation.

17.30 Now it’s time to talk and have a drink, to exchange e-mails and to promise we would all come to the next release party. The public was enthusiastic and gave compliments to the Ubuntu-BE members who did a perfect job helping everyone

19.00 The last participants left the room and went home or to the city for a drink. I, from my side, I was dead tired … went home and fell in a deep sleep, having nice dreams about what’s coming next. Exiting times are arriving for Ubuntu.
