While this page is about me, I'll be opening up a wiki for Sony VAIO laptops. It is time for the Sony VAIO community to come together. 

Hey Guys,
Currently I am a college students who has been managing private linux and windows servers for the past 3 years. While I myself finally switched to linux and am now a proud user. What took me so long, revolves around my family not wanting to switch. But now that I am part of something that has given me so much freedom, It is my responsibility to give back. Long Live Ubuntu!!! & Debian!!!.
