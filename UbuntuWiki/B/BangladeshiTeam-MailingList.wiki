The term is often extended to include the people subscribed to such a list, so the group of subscribers is referred to as ''the mailing list'', or simply ''the list''. <<BR>><<BR>>For more about mailing list, please visit <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mailing_list|the Wikipedia]]</nowiki>.

=== Official Mailing List ===

In addition to <nowiki>[[BangladeshiTeam-IRC|IRC channels]]</nowiki>, Ubuntu-BD uses a <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_mailing_list|mailing list]]</nowiki> as one of the primary form of communication. You may subscribe to the '''''ubuntu-bd''''''''@''''''''lists.ubuntu.com''''' mailing list and view its archives <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-bd|here]]</nowiki>.

==== Mailing List Ground Rules ====

While on the Ubuntu-BD mailing list, you are expected to abide by the <nowiki>[[http://ubuntu.com/community/conduct|Ubuntu Code of Conduct]]</nowiki> (CoC). Most of what is applicable to the mailing list can be summarized as follows (taken from <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/community/conduct|ubuntu.com]]</nowiki>):

 '''''Be respectful.''' The Ubuntu community and its members treat one another with respect. Everyone can make a valuable contribution to Ubuntu. We may not always agree, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It's important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. We expect members of the Ubuntu community to be respectful when dealing with other contributors as well as with people outside the Ubuntu project, and with users of Ubuntu.''

==== Mailing List Guidelines ====

In addition to the above ground rules, we have a guide to help the members make the best use of our mailing list.  New subscribers are requested to familiarize themselves with the ground rules and the guide lines before posting to the mailing list.

* When you reply to a message, don't include the entire length of the original message in your post. Take the time to use your delete key and either select the small part that is pertinent to your letter or summarize it in your response.
* Avoid posting "Me Too" messages, i.e., short replies to the whole list just to say that you agree or had a similar reaction or experience unless the mail demands short answers (i.e. a poll). It is better to send these by private mail to the original poster. If you have something valuable to add, then by all means send this to the list.  As a general guideline, the new content in a follow-up post should exceed the quoted context.
* Label the content of your post in the subject line. If the subject in your response differs from the one your are replying to, update the subject line to match your new topic.
* All mail to the list should directly be related to Ubuntu or Ubuntu-bd. For example, don't send unnecessary columns, chain letters, other people's inspirational poetry, or any off-topic information to the list, no matter how wonderful or necessary you may find it. These things occupy valuable space.
* Take care in what you write. Remember that many people will read your post, and it will be archived by the Ubuntu Mailing List for a very long time.

* Consider your audience. Email always sounds harsher than it is because there are no accompanying gestures or facial expressions.
* Do not give offense or be easily offended yourself. When you make your points keep your tone polite. Respond to the issues not to the personal attributes.
* Persistent disagreements with another person should be moved to private email and off of the list. The best way to stop a flame fest from happening is to ignore the folks who try to start them.
* Never repost private email to the mailing list (or any other forum or media) without permission of the original author. If you have permission to repost a message or information, please credit the author and show their email address.
* Don't post your phone number or mailing address to the list without understanding the potential consequences. It is better to send personal information by private email.
* Use either Bangla or English. Do not use any other languages other than Bangla or English. We do not have any common third language!
* Try not to post any message in <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengali_script#Romanization|Romanized Bangla]]</nowiki>. We are allergic to Romanized Bangla.
* Capitalize words only to highlight an important point or to distinguish a title or heading.  Capitalizing whole words that are not titles is generally termed as SHOUTING! Do not write the whole message in capital letter. *Asterisks* surrounding a word can be used to make a stronger point.  Don't write an entire message in all lower case, either.
* Do not send email in <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS_language|SMS Language]]</nowiki>. Try to elaboratly express yourself.
* Keep the length of your signatures modest.  Maximum of five (5) vertical lines (including the blank lines, special characters etc) is the limit.

=== Subscription ===

If you do not subscribe post any email to the team mailing list, your messages will need to be approved by a moderator, which may takes the email to appear in the list with a longer delay. The only way around this is to <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-bd|subscribe to the Mailing List]]</nowiki> and post directly to '''''ubuntu-bd''''''''@''''''''lists.ubuntu.com''''' via e-mail from the same address that you used to subscribe.

=== Unsubscription ===

If you want to unsubscribe yourself from the Mailing List, then just go <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-bd|here]]</nowiki> and use the '''Unsubscribe''' option from the bottom of the page.

=== File Attachments ===

Currently our mailing list does not provide the option to upload/send/receive/distribute any files attached to the email. As a result, if you send any attachment with your email, it will not be sent to the other members of the mailing list. We suggest you to use external file/image hosting sites to upload your attachments and then paste the link of the uploaded file to your email body.
