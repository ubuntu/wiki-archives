=== Agenda discussion ===

* Recruitment ~ Thank you to all the members of the team. I feel we have a stable core for the team and would like input from the team re: recruitment. It seems, for better or worse, one requirement is that members use IRC, at least from time to time. It seems to me that team members who are only "forums based" do not seem to integrate into the team and we often have little contact with them. In addition I think step one is for potential new members both become comfortable with IRC and that we get to know them before asking them to join. So I am thinking :

# Establish contact on IRC.
# We take the time to identify potential new members.
# Potential new members are then "nominated" by team members by having an existing member post the nomination here.
# We vote nominees up or down @ meetings, in private.

* Bots. There are too many and at times it is distracting (or worse). I would ask the bots be scaled back and only be brought in after asking permission. I would not mind a '''single''' "Team bot" , but we would need to agree to this as a team and designate the bot. 
* Mission Statement - it is vague and tacky, to say the least.  We need to lay out EXACTLY why we are here and what our mission is - this will allow us to think and act in the best interests of the team, and ultimately, the Ubuntu community.

===== New Members =====

* From Joeb454: I would like to nominate tinivole as a potential member, though I only contacted him today (June 1st) But his posting seems plenty good enough, and he's interested.

(05:09:20 PM) bodhi_zazen: Wiki Team :

(05:09:31 PM) Rocket2DMn: hi.

(05:09:35 PM) bodhi_zazen: Rocket2DMn, thanks

(05:09:40 PM) st33med: lol

(05:09:55 PM) speeddemon8803: wiki team comment:Hi has been noted. :)

(05:09:56 PM) Rocket2DMn: Wiki team is doing ok, I'm hoping to get people to help with the community wiki

(05:10:08 PM) bodhi_zazen: Wiki team looks good, anyone else working on wiki ?

(05:10:11 PM) Rocket2DMn: let me know after the meeting if you're interested

(05:10:19 PM) speeddemon8803: rocket, im interested.

(05:10:32 PM) speeddemon8803: meh, you said after meeting..whatever...yeah.

(05:10:49 PM) Rocket2DMn: yeah, let me know afterward and we'll discuss it

(05:10:52 PM) bodhi_zazen: My origional idea of a wiki team was to give people exposure / experience on wiki -> turn loose on Ubuntu wiki

(05:11:02 PM) Rocket2DMn: you can read here - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Beginners/Team/FocusGroups/Wiki

(05:11:29 PM) speeddemon8803: bodhi_zazen, still a good idea, but people should really download moinmoin if they want a full experience, that way the ubuntu wiki's arent totally crapped out.

(05:11:29 PM) bodhi_zazen: We could have a wiki tip page ?

(05:11:30 PM) bodhi_zazen: lol

(05:11:30 PM) Rocket2DMn: I will update that page later to note that we are moving on to help with community docs

(05:11:57 PM) Rocket2DMn: there are help pages for editing the wiki, I will post links from the wiki focus group page

(05:12:03 PM) speeddemon8803: (that way we dont have to edit our wiki because of someones huge mistakes)

(05:12:19 PM) bodhi_zazen: moinmoin ? does that not set up your own wiki site ?

(05:12:24 PM) speeddemon8803: rocket, great, thanks :)

(05:12:53 PM) bodhi_zazen: +1 Rocket2DMn , but we should expand some of the examples, on out pages, IMO

(05:13:10 PM) bodhi_zazen: Questions re: Wiki Focus team ?

(05:13:20 PM) Rocket2DMn: alright, ill post some simple tips and links for wiki editing

(05:13:33 PM) #ubuntuforums-beginners: mode (+v chanlog ) by ChanServ

(05:13:36 PM) bodhi_zazen: Rocket2DMn, I can help as well

(05:13:49 PM) bodhi_zazen: Next ...

(05:16:34 PM) y_lee: great idea bodhi

(05:16:39 PM) alexandremrj: launchpad and translations? it's simpler for that than bug reports

(05:16:41 PM) ***Flare183 still wants to join and help (no rush)

(05:16:44 PM) bodhi_zazen: Brief how-to use launchpad, intro to beginner team on launchpad, and bug reports

(05:20:11 PM) Rocket2DMn: we will update that page later, please continue with the meeting

(05:20:25 PM) bodhi_zazen: Last I think is the Security Focus group

==== Security Focus Group ====

(05:20:47 PM) bodhi_zazen: I think the security group is in steath mode, which is fine

(05:21:04 PM) bodhi_zazen: My initial thoughts are to increase awareness of security

(05:21:04 PM) Rocket2DMn: it's more secure that way.

(05:21:08 PM) speeddemon8803: security and stealth are great :)

(05:21:18 PM) vor-ubuntu: Always good to have you ports stealthed.

(05:21:21 PM) bodhi_zazen: I am thinking I should writ a brief how to UFW

(05:21:25 PM) #ubuntuforums-beginners: mode (+v PrivateVoid ) by ChanServ

(05:21:27 PM) bodhi_zazen: anyone here use UFW ?

(05:21:36 PM) alexandremrj: me

(05:21:37 PM) Flare183: What is UFW?

(05:21:45 PM) bodhi_zazen: Ubutu FireWall

(05:21:46 PM) speeddemon8803: ubuntu firewall

(05:21:48 PM) Flare183: oh

(05:21:51 PM) st33med: No...

(05:21:51 PM) speeddemon8803: yeah i use it bodhi

(05:21:52 PM) bodhi_zazen: It is very nice and easy to learn

(05:21:56 PM) alexandremrj: uncomplicated firewall

(05:21:57 PM) spiderbatdad: bodhi_zazen using your forums security page, in the forums, to direct new users is useful

(05:22:04 PM) ***Flare183 uses iptables

(05:22:04 PM) st33med: Would I need UFW?

(05:22:05 PM) spiderbatdad: +1 on great article

(05:22:07 PM) speeddemon8803: alex, yeah your right it is uncomplicated

(05:22:10 PM) Joeb454: ok back - I postponed my coffee until after the meeting :)

(05:22:34 PM) speeddemon8803: alexandremrj, its not "ubuntu" its "uncomplicated" but..we like ubuntu firewall better :P

(05:22:40 PM) alexandremrj: ups

(05:22:48 PM) alexandremrj: nice

(05:22:52 PM) bodhi_zazen: OK, I would like to keep new users informed re : security

(05:23:08 PM) bodhi_zazen: Install & forget is a poor security practice

(05:23:16 PM) y_lee: lol

(05:23:17 PM) Joeb454: I don't recommend forgetting

(05:23:22 PM) bodhi_zazen: In terms of firewall, that is an opinion

(05:23:24 PM) Whiffle: forget what?

(05:23:26 PM) speeddemon8803: on any distribution or OS too

(05:23:38 PM) bodhi_zazen: we should avoid the flames re: firewall or not and teach users how to use it

(05:23:42 PM) bodhi_zazen: and what to use it for

(05:23:44 PM) speeddemon8803: install and forget about everything else....dude, thats asking for trouble.

(05:24:06 PM) st33med: I don't think users are going to be under attack by hackers...

(05:24:10 PM) bodhi_zazen: I will try to write a how to UFW in the next week or two

(05:24:28 PM) speeddemon8803: st33med, you never know...

(05:24:29 PM) bodhi_zazen: nice to introduce it as a feature, and it's capabilities and configuration options

(05:24:38 PM) Joeb454: ty bodhi_zazen, I don't use a firewall, though I haven't for about 1.5 years

(05:24:39 PM) bodhi_zazen: st33med, I disagree

(05:24:46 PM) alexandremrj: st33med, it's best to be safe than sorry

(05:24:47 PM) st33med: educate me

(05:24:58 PM) Monicker: many victims are targets of opoportunity. if you have been singled out, you are going to have a fun battle.

(05:25:10 PM) bodhi_zazen: If you run a ssh server, ftp server, or http you will be attacked

(05:25:11 PM) Flare183: !firewall

(05:25:12 PM) ubot3: Ubuntu, like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo), or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).

(05:25:18 PM) Maddeth: ok st33med i will hack you and then del all your files then we'll see what you say :p

(05:25:20 PM) bodhi_zazen: Install a ssh server and check you logs

(05:25:22 PM) spiderbatdad: bodhi_zazen =1

(05:25:25 PM) Flare183: or

(05:25:28 PM) Joeb454: bodhi_zazen, where is that log ;)

(05:25:30 PM) chanlog: Title: IPTables HowTo - Community Ubuntu Documentation (at help.ubuntu.com)

(05:25:33 PM) bodhi_zazen: You will shit a brick in a day or two

(05:25:34 PM) spiderbatdad: a big hole in any firewall is not a firewall

(05:25:41 PM) Flare183: !virus (this is kinda of a weird link)

(05:25:48 PM) Flare183: ???

(05:25:55 PM) Flare183: PriceChild: sorry about that

(05:25:57 PM) bodhi_zazen: Joeb454, ssh logs later

(05:26:03 PM) PriceChild: Flare183: no problem

(05:26:06 PM) Joeb454: ok :)

(05:26:08 PM) st33med: bodhi_zazen, but most users will not run http, tcp, or ssh server.

(05:26:17 PM) Flare183: !virus

(05:26:17 PM) ubot3: A/V software is available, however read this to understand why Linux does not have a virus problem: http://librenix.com/?inode=21

(05:26:20 PM) Maddeth: dont need

(05:26:21 PM) y_lee: agreed

(05:26:22 PM) spiderbatdad: st33med i disagree

(05:26:27 PM) st33med: lol

(05:26:29 PM) bodhi_zazen: IPTables is hard for new users to learn, and Firestarter is problematic at times

(05:26:45 PM) bodhi_zazen: st33med, lol

(05:26:47 PM) spiderbatdad: all kinds of ubuntu newbies are getting into ftp and ssh

(05:26:48 PM) speeddemon8803: ufw is the best thing that has come out IMO

(05:26:55 PM) chanlog: Title: The short life and hard times of a Linux virus (at librenix.com)

(05:26:57 PM) vor-ubuntu: st33med: I bet tronyx is trying to hax0r you even as we speak.

(05:26:59 PM) Flare183: bodhi_zazen: Please explain (I haven't had problems with IpTables)

(05:27:09 PM) st33med: Oh, dear god!!!

(05:27:16 PM) Flare183: st33med: What?

(05:27:19 PM) ***st33med hides behind sudo password

(05:27:22 PM) bodhi_zazen: OK, the arguement of why/when/if to firewall is a matter of opinion

(05:27:24 PM) spiderbatdad: lol

(05:27:27 PM) speeddemon8803: and this meetings going crazy :/

(05:27:34 PM) st33med: :)

(05:27:35 PM) ***Flare183 shuts up

(05:27:54 PM) bodhi_zazen: We should focus on teaching how to firewall if users want to learn or engage a firewall and avoid flame wars

(05:28:02 PM) ***Flare183 whispers to bodhi_zazen: I still want to join.

(05:28:23 PM) bodhi_zazen: Flare183, most new users have no idea how to configure IP Tables, that is the problem

(05:28:27 PM) bodhi_zazen: lol

(05:28:28 PM) ***y_lee Flare183 don't sweat it you will join :)

(05:28:29 PM) Flare183: bodhi_zazen: ok

(05:28:35 PM) Flare183: y_lee: ok

(05:28:54 PM) y_lee: documentation on IP Tables is easy to find

(05:29:05 PM) y_lee: I looked thru it when i first installed Ubuntu

(05:29:06 PM) bodhi_zazen: Also I was considering a how-to on app-armour

(05:29:08 PM) Maddeth: google ftw

(05:29:24 PM) bodhi_zazen: In addition to UFW/apparmour ,,,

(05:29:44 PM) spiderbatdad: too bad chrooting gets so tricky

(05:29:48 PM) bodhi_zazen: If ANYONE has ANY suggestions for my Security page, please pass them on :)

(05:30:04 PM) speeddemon8803: or any questions at all....speak up

(05:30:12 PM) bodhi_zazen: +1

(05:30:12 PM) speeddemon8803: or be forever confused

(05:30:20 PM) speeddemon8803: :D

(05:30:25 PM) spiderbatdad: o/ question

(05:30:33 PM) bodhi_zazen: We can discuss the merits of firewalls at another time

(05:30:33 PM) ***y_lee is always confused

(05:30:40 PM) vor-ubuntu: bodhi_zazen: I didn't notice anything about stealthing your ports in your security guide.  :(

(05:30:48 PM) bodhi_zazen: go spiderbatdad :)

(05:30:55 PM) spiderbatdad: does hosting files owned by an unprivileged user actual help with security

(05:30:58 PM) alexandremrj: ok, guys, i have to go, sorry, i will read the logs tomorrow

(05:31:01 PM) alexandremrj: bye

(05:31:11 PM) bodhi_zazen: vor-ubuntu, Stealthing ports is not security, lol

(05:31:12 PM) Rocket2DMn: spiderbatdad, only if the hosting program is run by that user

(05:31:18 PM) spiderbatdad: my apache html and index files for example

(05:31:24 PM) vor-ubuntu: bodhi_zazen: ;)

(05:31:28 PM) alexandremrj left the room (quit: "Going out").

(05:31:31 PM) spiderbatdad: Rocket2DMn ty

(05:31:39 PM) Rocket2DMn: spiderbatdad, you would want apache to run under that limited user

(05:31:53 PM) Maddeth: stealthing makes no difference, they can still be picked up

(05:31:56 PM) spiderbatdad: ok I know how to do that

(05:32:06 PM) Rocket2DMn: moving on with the meeting?

(05:32:09 PM) spiderbatdad: no shell for the user

(05:32:11 PM) bodhi_zazen: yes

(05:32:13 PM) speeddemon8803: +1 Rocket2DMn

(05:32:30 PM) vor-ubuntu: Maddeth: It's funnier when I mention port stealthing and tronyx is around.  His head explodes.

(05:32:32 PM) bodhi_zazen: Questions re: security Focus team ?

(05:32:34 PM) ***Maddeth thinks Rocket2DMn needs a poo

(05:32:41 PM) speeddemon8803: none bodhi_zazen

(05:33:01 PM) st33med: none besides ufw that I will hold until later

(05:33:03 PM) bodhi_zazen: We can discuss security issues later, ##beginners-classroom ???

(05:33:06 PM) Maddeth: lol vor-ubuntu i bet it does

(05:34:16 PM) chanlog: Title: Beginners Team Meetings - Community Ubuntu Documentation (at help.ubuntu.com)

===== Mentoring =====

(05:34:30 PM) bodhi_zazen: #1 = Mentoring

(05:34:31 PM) st33med: oh

(05:34:39 PM) st33med: I want to

(05:34:42 PM) Joeb454: bodhi_zazen, I think moving to the agenda is a good idea

(05:34:45 PM) st33med: mentor for python

(05:34:52 PM) bodhi_zazen: Looks like mentoring will be popular

(05:35:00 PM) speeddemon8803: yeah :)

(05:35:00 PM) Rocket2DMn: see - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Beginners/Team/FocusGroups/Education

(05:35:02 PM) Joeb454: I'll try mentoring if there's a topic for it

(05:35:04 PM) chanlog: Title: Education Focus Group - Community Ubuntu Documentation (at help.ubuntu.com)

(05:35:06 PM) bodhi_zazen: we set up ##beginners-classroom which should work well for us

(05:35:06 PM) speeddemon8803: ill help with it too bodhi.

(05:35:29 PM) st33med: Though I need to write a vague tutorial

(05:35:32 PM) bodhi_zazen: I think the next step is to set times

(05:35:34 PM) st33med: planning and such

(05:35:45 PM) bodhi_zazen: For each topic we should have 2 times

(05:35:54 PM) speeddemon8803: yeah

(05:36:06 PM) bodhi_zazen: One for the Americas and a second for the other side of the world

(05:36:13 PM) st33med: Can I be first mentor :D

(05:36:17 PM) st33med: to go?

(05:36:26 PM) speeddemon8803: GMT :)

(05:36:44 PM) bodhi_zazen: Next, select a topic and mentor -> off we go :)

(05:36:46 PM) y_lee: set times is a good idea I would like to sit on some of those

(05:36:57 PM) vor-ubuntu: bodhi_zazen: The education stuff is interesting but, I'm slightly confused by it.  Is the idea to create a tutorial and then be available at certain times to answer questions or to create the tutorial on the fly in the IRC channel?

(05:36:58 PM) y_lee: sit in i meant

(05:37:00 PM) Rocket2DMn: looks like paultag heads up the education team, i think its up to him who does what when and in what order.  however, deciding on a universal time sounds good

(05:37:01 PM) st33med: bodhi_zazen, Americas on a weekday, rest on weekend\holiday

(05:37:01 PM) ***Joeb454 guesses if he mentors it'll be "the rest of the world" time

(05:37:13 PM) bodhi_zazen: How about if we set a goal of establishing times over the next month ?

(05:37:23 PM) st33med: sure...

(05:37:24 PM) st33med: uh

(05:37:31 PM) speeddemon8803: sure bodhi

(05:37:36 PM) Maddeth: brb tucking bonny in

(05:37:37 PM) st33med: I am not sure WHEN I will be able to though

(05:37:38 PM) bodhi_zazen: Mentors prep topics

(05:38:07 PM) ***speeddemon8803 is typing some stuff as we speak (concerning topics maybe)

(05:38:12 PM) Rocket2DMn: sounds good, have paultag decide on the order i guess, and we can agree on a time over the next month

(05:38:18 PM) bodhi_zazen: vor-ubuntu, I think the format is up to mentors

(05:38:47 PM) bodhi_zazen: I like the idea of asking the mentors to post a "handout" outline

(05:39:08 PM) Rocket2DMn: that sounds good, we can do a handout and a log

(05:39:09 PM) vor-ubuntu: That seems reasonable

(05:39:10 PM) Joeb454: thing is, a lot of you are in the US - and then there's a few of us in Europe, and AJ is in Aus

(05:39:20 PM) bodhi_zazen: The "students" then read outline -> show up at irc of Q & A

(05:39:23 PM) bodhi_zazen: *for

(05:39:26 PM) ***Flare183 thinks that the beginners team needs to have there own part of the Ubuntu Forums

(05:39:33 PM) Joeb454: Flare183, we have

(05:39:36 PM) speeddemon8803: flare, we do

(05:39:36 PM) bodhi_zazen: Flare183, we do

(05:39:44 PM) Joeb454: Flare183, http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=215

(05:39:45 PM) bodhi_zazen: run Flare183 run

(05:39:46 PM) Flare183: oh

(05:39:47 PM) vor-ubuntu: Yeah, that seems reasonable, bodhi_zazen.

(05:39:48 PM) chanlog: Title: Beginner Team - Ubuntu Forums (at ubuntuforums.org)

(05:39:49 PM) Flare183: ok

(05:39:55 PM) y_lee: lol

(05:40:07 PM) Flare183: sry

(05:40:09 PM) bodhi_zazen: I do not mind hosting tutorials

(05:40:26 PM) Rocket2DMn: we can put them on the wiki, too, under the Education pages

(05:40:31 PM) bodhi_zazen: As you may know, I set up a domain and can have space for them

(05:40:34 PM) bodhi_zazen: wiki works too

(05:40:50 PM) Flare183: I already have a domain

(05:40:52 PM) Joeb454: bodhi_zazen, I can mirror (so long as server is up)

(05:40:52 PM) bodhi_zazen: If I host them they can be downloaded

(05:41:00 PM) speeddemon8803: my website (when i get one...) will have a few tutorials, ill probably post it on the wiki as a alternate source of info.

(05:41:01 PM) bodhi_zazen: *(we)

(05:41:04 PM) Rocket2DMn: whatever works best, if they are on the wiki they need to be formatted so, but if we put them on bodhi_zazen 's area, we can just link to the pdf or whatever

(05:41:17 PM) Flare183: If the team needs part of it then I can compromise

(05:41:32 PM) bodhi_zazen: OK, lets continue to discuss / establish mentoring

(05:41:54 PM) bodhi_zazen: I envisioned mentoring as a way of helping each other

(05:42:12 PM) ***bodhi_zazen is working on this http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=800138

(05:42:16 PM) chanlog: Title: FAQ: Web Development in Ubuntu - Ubuntu Forums (at ubuntuforums.org)

(05:42:19 PM) bodhi_zazen: reading that is, lol

(05:42:35 PM) Joeb454: bodhi_zazen, if you want I can code a html page

(05:42:44 PM) bodhi_zazen: :)

(05:42:48 PM) Rocket2DMn: cool, that looks like a hidden jewel of the forums

(05:42:56 PM) Joeb454: it'll give me something to do, and I'll update the links to pdf's/documents as mentoring goes along?

(05:42:59 PM) speeddemon8803: we are all pretty good with html if i remember right huh guys?

(05:43:05 PM) ***bodhi_zazen is king of hidden jewels on forums

(05:43:14 PM) ***Joeb454 just needs something to do - not got Uni til October

(05:43:17 PM) speeddemon8803: bodhi, you never seem to NOT amaze me dude.

(05:43:33 PM) bodhi_zazen:  :redface:

(05:43:46 PM) Rocket2DMn: we might like to organize a collection of the best howtos and guides on the forums

(05:43:48 PM) ***y_lee thinks html and css is simple

(05:43:49 PM) ***Flare183 laughs

(05:43:55 PM) bodhi_zazen: Any questions re: Mentoring ?

(05:43:58 PM) speeddemon8803: rocket +1

(05:44:05 PM) Flare183: nope

(05:44:10 PM) speeddemon8803: none here

(05:44:16 PM) bodhi_zazen: Rocket2DMn, that has been attempted in the past

(05:44:21 PM) bodhi_zazen: It was the UDSF

(05:44:26 PM) Joeb454: Rocket2DMn, tutorials and tips section

(05:44:28 PM) Rocket2DMn: i know, the keyword is attempted, but UDSF is dead

(05:44:33 PM) Joeb454: no Q's over here

(05:44:35 PM) speeddemon8803: bodhi, i might reincarnate that :)

(05:44:44 PM) speeddemon8803: ive said it before...its gonna happen! :)

(05:44:54 PM) bodhi_zazen: IMO we should move forums gems --> Ubuntu Wiki gems

(05:45:06 PM) bodhi_zazen: OK,

(05:45:08 PM) Rocket2DMn: let's table that for the next meeting bodhi_zazen

(05:45:09 PM) bodhi_zazen: Next :

(05:45:28 PM) PrivateVoid: hey superbenny you here?

(05:45:38 PM) bodhi_zazen: Team Avatar

(05:45:46 PM) bodhi_zazen: Any interest ?

(05:45:52 PM) speeddemon8803: bodhi_zazen, +1

(05:45:59 PM) PrivateVoid: I am still trying to make a team avatar theme

(05:46:00 PM) speeddemon8803: i am, im tired of mine :/

(05:46:01 PM) Joeb454: bodhi_zazen, I've still got the heron overdrank made for me

(05:46:05 PM) Flare183: bodhi_zazen: Tux with a Ubuntu Symbol below it

(05:46:15 PM) PrivateVoid: I will have time to try this weekend bodhi_zazen

(05:46:15 PM) Flare183: or next to it

(05:46:16 PM) bodhi_zazen: The heron is a nice one :)

(05:46:17 PM) Rocket2DMn: im still using one overdrank made for Hardy

(05:46:44 PM) bodhi_zazen: I got an animated avatar I am fond of at the moment, LOL

(05:46:47 PM) y_lee: I am using the heron i stole offa bodhi

(05:46:49 PM) spiderbatdad: Change it with each new release?

(05:46:54 PM) Joeb454: bodhi_zazen, I'm thinking of asking O.D to make me a heron/ibex avatar ;)

(05:47:01 PM) overdrank: look great bodhi_zazen

(05:47:03 PM) Joeb454: because I'm testing 8.10 in a VM

(05:47:11 PM) vor-ubuntu: It will have to be something that allows for the incorporation of other images into the avatar.  Everytime I change my avatar away from the San Lorenzo crest, they start losing...

(05:47:17 PM) ***Flare183 is using 8.10

(05:47:25 PM) Joeb454: bodhi_zazen, is it only staff that can have animated avatars?

(05:47:30 PM) bodhi_zazen: We should submit ideas / examples of a team avatar to a wiki page

(05:47:31 PM) speeddemon8803: joe, correct

(05:47:46 PM) speeddemon8803: joe, as far as i know anyways

(05:47:46 PM) bodhi_zazen: Joeb454, yes, and a few others, not sure of the list

(05:47:46 PM) PrivateVoid: vor-ubuntu, my ideas was to make a 'theme' for the team and it would be in parts so people could tweak it

(05:47:49 PM) Rocket2DMn: bodhi_zazen, that might be easier to organize on the forums

(05:48:09 PM) bodhi_zazen: I have a thread on the forums no-one is using , LOL

(05:48:09 PM) Joeb454: yeah

(05:48:13 PM) Joeb454: what thread?

(05:48:14 PM) vor-ubuntu: PrivateVoid: I agree.  As long as I can incorporate the San Lorenzo crest.

(05:48:30 PM) Rocket2DMn: its easier to use the forums than the wiki, esp. with attachments and whatnot

(05:48:35 PM) PrivateVoid: that would be my idea -- that way everyone can be 'personal' but still identified as part of the team

(05:48:37 PM) bodhi_zazen: sec

(05:49:06 PM) PrivateVoid: I just suck at gimp... so learning that is taking time

(05:49:21 PM) PrivateVoid: if I poached over to Windows and used my Corel I could have the thing done in an hour

(05:49:27 PM) bodhi_zazen: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=786320

(05:49:31 PM) chanlog: Title: Team Avatar Theme - Ubuntu Forums (at ubuntuforums.org)

(05:50:07 PM) overdrank: give me some Ideas and I will work on some more things

(05:50:26 PM) Joeb454: overdrank, heron vs ibex ;)

(05:50:34 PM) bodhi_zazen: My thought would be to provide a theme and let members "roll their own"

(05:50:42 PM) vor-ubuntu: Joeb454: I think the ibex would win.

(05:50:44 PM) Joeb454: lol

(05:50:45 PM) bodhi_zazen: Interested members could gimp for others

(05:50:50 PM) Rocket2DMn: the problem is most of us are not very good with the gimp

(05:50:53 PM) ***Joeb454 sucks at gimp

(05:51:00 PM) speeddemon8803: bodhi_zazen, sure

(05:51:01 PM) ***Joeb454 also notes how wrong that's gonna look in the logs

(05:51:05 PM) spiderbatdad: dr  small would apparently add his face to any avatar

(05:51:07 PM) st33med: what will the ibex bird look like...

(05:51:10 PM) PrivateVoid: I will use my wife's computer and whip up a theme tonight bodhi_zazen

(05:51:18 PM) bodhi_zazen: :)

(05:51:19 PM) vor-ubuntu: Joeb454: Hahaha

(05:51:23 PM) Rocket2DMn: lol st33med , wth?

(05:51:26 PM) bodhi_zazen: Lets see what we can come up with

(05:51:28 PM) st33med: :D

(05:51:44 PM) Joeb454: Rocket2DMn, I said heron vs ibex therefore ibex bird

(05:51:49 PM) PrivateVoid: 90x90 and 80x80 right?

(05:51:54 PM) bodhi_zazen: Also, never feel "guilty" for using windows applications as you are transitioning to Linux

(05:52:00 PM) bodhi_zazen: It is called learning, LOL

(05:52:19 PM) PrivateVoid: 90x90...

(05:52:19 PM) Flare183: wow

(05:52:20 PM) Joeb454: PrivateVoid, avatars are 80x80 I think, and profile pics are 90x90

(05:52:20 PM) bodhi_zazen: As you transition to Linux you will use the windows tools less and less

(05:52:25 PM) ***y_lee don't believe in guilt lol

(05:52:29 PM) PrivateVoid: yeah I know learning, but...

(05:52:40 PM) speeddemon8803:  bodhi_zazen agreed

(05:52:41 PM) ***Joeb454 hasn't used windows for ages, except earlier when my dad wanted to check for songs on iTunes...I hated it

(05:52:52 PM) vor-ubuntu: Windows?

(05:53:05 PM) speeddemon8803: vor-ubunt "windows? whazzat?"

(05:53:06 PM) speeddemon8803: :)

(05:53:42 PM) superbenny: you sent the private link to that list

(06:14:01 PM) Rocket2DMn: i say no more bots ever except chanlog and ubotu

(06:14:02 PM) bodhi_zazen: I think we should allow only one

(06:14:02 PM) superbenny: vor...that means you lol

(06:14:09 PM) spiderbatdad: who has permission to have a bot here?

(06:14:18 PM) bodhi_zazen: ubot3 FTW

(06:14:20 PM) ubot3: Factoid ftw not found

(06:14:22 PM) bodhi_zazen: thanks nalioth

(06:14:25 PM) superbenny: haha

(06:14:26 PM) Joeb454: lol

(06:14:27 PM) Rocket2DMn: even ubot3 is questionable

(06:14:46 PM) bodhi_zazen: IF we want to allow additional bots, it should be by team consensus

(06:14:51 PM) Joeb454: bodhi_zazen, I stumbled across #bots the other day

(06:15:05 PM) Joeb454: and I actually think vor-bot may be useful, as he find wikipedia info

(06:15:05 PM) bodhi_zazen: Anyone, other then bot owners, want to nominate additinal bots in this channel ?

(06:15:07 PM) spiderbatdad: so give permission to different owners on a weekly basis

(06:15:11 PM) Joeb454: ^^

(06:15:16 PM) overdrank: ubot

(06:15:17 PM) vor-ubuntu: I'm happy to take vor-bot out.  He's just a fun toy really.

(06:15:30 PM) Rocket2DMn: all the bots are just toys, really

(06:15:34 PM) PrivateVoid: yes -- do people want it saved as a png and/or photoshop file?

(06:15:36 PM) bodhi_zazen: Rotate in a bot a week ?

(06:15:48 PM) spiderbatdad: 89% of the time, this is a channel of inactivity

(06:15:48 PM) Rocket2DMn: bodhi_zazen, to what end?

(06:15:52 PM) bodhi_zazen: PrivateVoid, png

(06:16:03 PM) PrivateVoid: ok... going over there to save and upload

(06:16:09 PM) Joeb454: as an IRC co-lead (it's up to ajmorris to agree here) - I'd say if you want t play, you can have them in ##beginners-help, but stop using them if an unkown comes in

(06:16:09 PM) speeddemon8803: I say as long as their not counterproductive and overly used in a non supportive way of the team......their fine....just...a lot of bots at one time is like...whoa heh.

(06:16:39 PM) Joeb454: it clears this channel, and ##beginners-help is still used less than this

(06:16:48 PM) ***speeddemon8803 nods

(06:18:50 PM) spiderbatdad: that is obnoxious

(06:18:58 PM) vor-ubuntu: I'm going to go -1.  Not because I'm opposed to removing vor-bot but, because I don't see the point in moving him to beginners-help.

(06:19:02 PM) Rocket2DMn: can there be a vote for no bot sin any of our channels?

(06:19:04 PM) paultag: brb
