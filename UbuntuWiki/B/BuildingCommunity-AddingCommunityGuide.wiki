== Adding Community Documentation ==

If you are interested in writing some documentation about how to run a community more effectively, there are some few simple steps to follow to ensure your hard work gets read by as many people as possible. Just follow these simple steps:

=== Step 1: Be consistent ===

If you are going to document something, first make sure it is page of the BuildingCommunity section (such as BuildingCommunity/SampleDocument).

Next, ensure you have a main title for the page and the menu bar included at the top:

<pre>
== Your Document Name ==

<nowiki>[[Include(BuildingCommunityHeader)]]</nowiki>
</pre>

=== Step 2: Make it searchable ===

Add a category footer so the the Building Community can be searched.

<pre>
----
[:CategoryBuildingCommunity]
</pre>

=== Step 3: Make it findable ===

Make sure you add your document to the correct part of the <nowiki>[[BuildingCommunity/KnowledgeBase|Knowledge Base]]</nowiki>.

Thats it. We look forward to seeing your documentation!
