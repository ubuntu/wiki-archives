__TOC__

This is an overview of the different paths people take to file bugs. Some paths may be preferred as they present users with better documentation on how to file the most useful reports. We need to do some research to find out which paths people take and how common they are. We can ask various sysadmins and we can do a survey of bug filers.

=== Survey ===

=== Comments ===

We could send a survey to the ubuntu users mailing list and ask the replies to be sent to bug-survey@ubuntu.com (say).

'''Sample questions:'''

<pre>
1. How many bugs have you filed against Ubuntu
2. When was your first bug filed
3. How did you find the page to file it on, which links did you follow?
4. Were you able to identify the appropriate package to file under?
5. Please give your Launchpad ID (optional)
</pre>

Any other questions we should include?
