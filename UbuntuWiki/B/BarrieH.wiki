March 19, 2008 is a date I'll remember for a long time!  That's when my XP system wouldn't boot and MS had me on hold for 45 minutes!  That was it, the end, game over.  I installed Ubuntu 7.10 and haven't looked back.  I've still got a dual boot system but honestly can't remember the last time I haven't booted into Ubuntu.  I'm currently running 8.04 LTS and aside from a few hiccups all is well!
