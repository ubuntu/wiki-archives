==== About Me ====
Well,Howdy folks!I've been an on and off user of Ubuntu for the last 4 years and finally I decided(after the additional incentive of "Free OriginalCD's") to sign up for some ubuntu testing. I can't really say I've got that much of an experience with the inner workings of Ubuntu, but I'm ready an' willing to be the guinea pig for the next big release... Live a little so to speak :)
