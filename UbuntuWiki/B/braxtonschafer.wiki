== About Me ==
I was born and raised in a Linux/open source household.  I was using Debian just as soon as I could read.  I started using Ubuntu at 6.10, and haven't looked back since.  I'm currently a junior in a high school of about 400.  I enjoy listening to and playing music.
== Giving back to the FOSS Community ==
I am an advanced Spanish student and have been translating programs on Launchpad as I have time.  It feels great to finally give back to the community that has given me so much.
