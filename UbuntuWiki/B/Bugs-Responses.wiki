|-
| <tablestyle="background-color: #eee">Thank you for taking the time to report this bug and helping to make Ubuntu better. You have reported a crash that actually happened in the libavcodec or libavformat library. In order to be able to actually fix this bug, we must be able to:<<BR>><<BR>>1. Reproduce it;<<BR>>2. Check if it happens with the latest version; and<<BR>>3. Understand where it actually crashes.<<BR>><<BR>>You can help with the first point by attaching an example file to this bug report. Please note that a proper attachment is preferred over a link to some remote site. Remote sites that are password protected or otherwise restricted (services like rapidshare.com) are absolutely not acceptable. If your file is too large, try to reproduce with the first few MB only. See http://ffmpeg.org/bugreports.html section "Submitting Sample Media" for guidelines.<<BR>><<BR>>Please also make sure that your file crashes with the commandline application ''ffplay'' from the '''ffmpeg''' package. If the crash does not happen with that tool, the bug does not belong to the '''ffmpeg''' package, but to some higher-level package like '''libxine1-ffmpeg''' or '''gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg''' (depending on what player has been used).

== Incomplete bugs without a response from submitter ==
Some bugs are never responded to by the submitter (also called "original poster", or "OP"). These bugs will be automatically expired by Launchpad in 60 days, counted from the day it was set incomplete. There is no need to act on them (and, actually, changing the bug will restart the expiry period).
Note that this applies for the Ubuntu project (i.e., those bug tasks that have "(Ubuntu)" in their name). Other projects may, or may not, have automatic incomplete bug expiration set.

== Bugs without a package ==
Sometimes bugs will be reported just using the "Ubuntu" package. This is not the best place for the bug though and we should encourage bug reporters to report the bug against the correct package by pointing them at some documentation. Keep in mind PKGNAME is a placeholder.

/!\ If you use this response, you must assign a package. If you do not know what package to assign, please leave the bug alone, and ask for help.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <tablestyle="background-color: #eee"> Thank you for taking the time to report this bug and helping to make Ubuntu better. This bug did not have a package associated with it, which is important for ensuring that it gets looked at by the proper developers.  You can learn more about finding the right package at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bugs/FindRightPackage. I have classified this bug as a bug in PKGNAME.<<BR>><<BR>>When reporting bugs in the future please use apport by using 'ubuntu-bug' and the name of the package affected. You can learn more about this functionality at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ReportingBugs.
|}

== Bugs resolved after update or config change ==
Occasionally bug reporters will indicate that a bug has been fixed after some software update or after changing a configuration value back to its default value. These bug reports should be set to 'Invalid' since we don't know the root cause. When closing the bug report it is a good idea to take an opportunity to let the reporter know how to manage bug statuses.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <tablestyle="background-color: #eee"> This bug report is being closed due to your last comment regarding this being fixed with an update. For future reference you can manage the status of your own bugs by clicking on the current status in the yellow line and then choosing a new status in the revealed drop down box. You can learn more about bug statuses at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bugs/Status. Thank you again for taking the time to report this bug and helping to make Ubuntu better. Please submit any future bugs you may find.
|}

== Needing testing in the development release ==
A lot of bug reports need testing in the development release of Ubuntu. This is something that most anyone can do by downloading the Desktop ISO, booting from it and testing their particular bug.

Before using this, ''please'' check "rmadison <package>" to see if the package version has changed between when the bug was reported and the current development release. If it has not changed, there is no need to ask. If it has changed, check the changelog (via aptitude changelog $PKGNAME) to see if this issue has been specifically addressed.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <tablestyle="background-color: #eee"> Thank you for taking the time to report this bug and helping to make Ubuntu better. The issue that you reported is one that should be reproducible with the live environment of the Desktop ISO of the development release. It would help us greatly if you could test with it so we can work on getting it fixed in the next release of Ubuntu. You can find out more about the development release at http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/. Thanks again and we appreciate your help.

== Missing a crash report or having a .crash attachment ==
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <tablestyle="background-color: #eee"> Thank you for taking the time to report this bug and helping to make Ubuntu better. It sounds like some part of the system has crashed. To help us find the cause of the crash please follow these steps:<<BR>><<BR>>1. Run these commands:<<BR>>`    journalctl -b0 > journal.txt`<<BR>>`    journalctl -b-1 > prevjournal.txt`<<BR>>and attach the resulting text files here.<<BR>><<BR>>2. Look in `/var/crash` for crash files and if found run:<<BR>>`    ubuntu-bug YOURFILE.crash`<<BR>>Then tell us the ID of the newly-created bug.<<BR>><<BR>>3. If step 2 failed then look at https://errors.ubuntu.com/user/ID where ID is the content of file `/var/lib/whoopsie/whoopsie-id` on the machine. Do you find any links to recent problems on that page? If so then please send the links to us.<<BR>><<BR>>Please take care to avoid attaching .crash files to bugs as we are unable to process them as file attachments. It would also be a security risk for yourself.
|}

== A duplicate ==
When making a bug report a duplicate of another it is important to communicate to the reporter that any discussion regarding the bug should take place in the master bug.  Keep in mind that NUMBER is a placeholder and should be the number of the master bug report.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <tablestyle="background-color: #eee"> Thank you for taking the time to report this bug and helping to make Ubuntu better. This particular bug has already been reported and is a duplicate of bug NUMBER, so it is being marked as such. Please look at the other bug report to see if there is any missing information that you can provide, or to see if there is a workaround for the bug. Additionally, any further discussion regarding the bug should occur in the other report. Feel free to continue to report any other bugs you may find.

== About an obsolete version of the software for reporter's release ==
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <tablestyle="background-color: #eee"> Thank you for taking the time to report this bug and helping to make Ubuntu better. However, according to this report, you are not using the most recent version of this package for your Ubuntu release. Please upgrade to the most recent version and let us know if you are still having this issue. Thanks in advance.
|}

== Missing a back trace ==
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <tablestyle="background-color: #eee"> Thank you for taking the time to report this bug and helping to make Ubuntu better. Please try to obtain a backtrace following the instructions at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingProgramCrash and upload the backtrace (as an attachment) to the bug report. This will greatly help us in tracking down your problem.
|}

== Unusable stack trace after retracing ==
This is an alternative to the previous response, if there is a good chance that another retrace will work better (e.g. outdated package versions). Please close the bug as invalid with this comment:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <tablestyle="background-color: #eee"> Thank you for taking the time to report this bug and helping to make Ubuntu better.<<BR>><<BR>>However, processing it in order to get sufficient information for the developers failed (it does not generate an useful symbolic stack trace).

== Need valgrind log ==
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <tablestyle="background-color: #eee"> Thank you for taking the time to report this bug and helping to make Ubuntu better. Please try to obtain a valgrind log following the instructions at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Valgrind and attach the file to the bug report. This will greatly help us in tracking down your problem.
|}

== A bug that should be handled upstream ==
If you are sure the reported bug is not caused by the packaging for Ubuntu, it should usually be sent upstream by someone affected by the bug. If appropriate, replace GNOME with the organization behind the software (see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bugs/Upstream/ for available organizations):

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <tablestyle="background-color: #eee">Thank you for taking the time to report this bug and helping to make Ubuntu better. The issue you are reporting is an upstream one and it would be nice if somebody having it could send the bug to the developers of the software by following the instructions at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bugs/Upstream/GNOME. If you have done so, please tell us the number of the upstream bug (or the link), so we can add a bugwatch that will inform us about its status. Thanks in advance.
|}

If you have already pointed out that the reported bug is an upstream one, but there hasn't been any feedback about the requested upstream bug for 2 weeks, the reporter (or someone else affected by the bug) might have forgotten it. If that's the case, you should ask if someone has already forwarded the bug upstream and can tell you the number of the upstream bug:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <tablestyle="background-color: #eee"> Is there any news about this bug? Has someone affected by this bug sent the report upstream? Could you tell us the bug number, so we can add a bugwatch that will inform us about its status.? Thanks in advance.

We are sorry that we do not always have the capacity to look at all reported bugs in a timely manner. There have been many changes in Ubuntu since that time you reported the bug and your problem may have been fixed with some of the updates. It would help us a lot if you could test it on a currently supported Ubuntu version. When you test it and it is still an issue, kindly upload the updated logs by running only once:<<BR>>apport-collect <bug #><<BR>><<BR>> and any other logs that are relevant for this particular issue.
|}

== Packages not provided by Ubuntu ==
Occasionally, bug reporters will report a bug about a version of a package not provided by Ubuntu or less often about software not provided by Ubuntu. In which case we can not help them and the bug should be set to '''Invalid'''.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <tablestyle="background-color: #eee">Thank you for taking the time to report this bug and trying to help make Ubuntu better. However, it seems that you are not using a software package provided by the official Ubuntu repositories. Because of this the Ubuntu project can not support or fix your particular bug. Please report this bug to the provider of the software package. Thanks! <<BR>><<BR>>If you are interested in learning more about software repositories and Ubuntu, check https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories.
|}

== Fixed in Development release while still existing in a previous release ==
The bug's state should become '''Fix Released''' and if the package qualifies for a <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates#Procedure|Stable Release Update (SRU)]]</nowiki>:

{| class="wikitable"

| <tablestyle="background-color: #eee"> Thank you for taking the time to report this bug and helping to make Ubuntu better. However, I am closing it because the bug has been fixed in the latest development version of Ubuntu. It won't be fixed in previous versions of Ubuntu because the package doesn't fit the requirements for backporting. See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBackports for more information.

== Reported by someone not respecting the Code of Conduct ==
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <tablestyle="background-color: #eee"> Thank you for your bug report. To maintain a respectful atmosphere, please follow the code of conduct - http://www.ubuntu.com/project/about-ubuntu/conduct. Bug reports are handled by humans, the majority of whom are volunteers, so please bear this in mind.
|}

== A support request ==
Determining whether a bug report is actually a support request can be quite challenging, but if you decide the bug is a support request you can convert it to such by clicking "Convert to a question" at the top of the bug's web page. This will mark the bug as "Invalid", create a new question in the answer tracker and link it to the bug. In the comment dialog that you receive, post a comment to inform the reporter about your action, and advise them to use the support tracker for any future problems.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <tablestyle="background-color: #eee"> Thank you for taking the time to report this issue and helping to make Ubuntu better. Examining the information you have given us, this does not appear to be a bug report so we are closing it and converting it to a question in the support tracker. We understand the difficulties you are facing, but it is better to raise problems you are having in the support tracker at https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu if you are uncertain if they are bugs. If you would prefer live chat support, you can find an IRC support channel for your flavor of Ubuntu here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/IRC/ChannelList. You can also find help with your problem in the support forum of your local Ubuntu community http://loco.ubuntu.com/ or asking at https://askubuntu.com or https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/welcome-to-support-and-help/49951.

Chris Guiver provides an alternate wording (thanks, Chris!):

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <tablestyle="background-color: #eee"> Thank you for taking the time to report this bug and helping to make Ubuntu better.<<BR>><<BR>>Bug reporting is about finding & fixing problems thus preventing future users from hitting the same bug.<<BR>><<BR>>I suspect a Support site would be more appropriate, eg. https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu. You can also find help with your problem in the support forum of your local Ubuntu community http://loco.ubuntu.com/ or asking at https://askubuntu.com or https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/welcome-to-support-and-help/49951, or for more support options please look at https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/community-support/709.
|}

It is also a good idea to change the source package beforehand if it's set incorrectly, so that the question will be associated with the correct package in the answer tracker, or edit the question afterwards and assign it to the correct package. If it doesn't pertain to a specific package, change it to "Ubuntu".

== Not reported in English ==
This response is appropriate when a bug is not reported in English or some error messages are not in English.

{| class="wikitable"

This response may be necessary when someone is having strange issues with the Desktop ISO.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <tablestyle="background-color: #eee"> Thank you for taking the time to report this bug and helping to make Ubuntu better. While we appreciate the difficulties you are facing, it would appear that the image (ISO file) you downloaded could be corrupt.

== Patch attachment not flagged as a patch ==
When reviewing bug attachments you might find an attachment that is a <nowiki>[[ Bugs-Patches | patch ]]</nowiki>, but is not flagged. Let people know what a patch is!

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <tablestyle="background-color: #eee"> Looking at the attachments in this bug report, I noticed that an attachment was not flagged as a patch. A patch contains changes to an Ubuntu package that will resolve a bug and this attachment is one! Subsequently, I've checked the patch flag for it. In the future when submitting patches please use the patch checkbox as there are some Launchpad searches that use this feature. You can learn more about the patch workflow at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bugs/Patches.
|}

== Attachment incorrectly flagged as a patch ==
When reviewing bug attachments you might that someone flagged an attachment that is a <nowiki>[[ Bugs-Patches | patch ]]</nowiki>, but it really isn't one. Educate people know what a patch is!

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <tablestyle="background-color: #eee"> Looking at the attachments in this bug report, I noticed that one was flagged as a patch incorrectly. A patch contains changes to an Ubuntu package that will resolve a bug, since this was not one I've unchecked the patch flag for it. In the future keep in mind the definition of a patch. You can learn more about what qualifies as a patch at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bugs/Patches. Thanks!

== Package installation failure ==
If the problem looks like local file system corruption (e. g. bug Bug:322714, which indicates broken/truncated dpkg .list files), it is most likely not something we can fix in Ubuntu in general. Since we have a large number of such bugs, it is probably best to close it as invalid (or incomplete if you want to followup and subscribe) with this comment:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <tablestyle="background-color: #eee"> Thank you for your report. This package failure looks like being caused by a corrupted file system. Please start the "Memory check" from the boot menu. If that runs successfully, please start the desktop ISO. Hold right-shift key after the BIOS checks to get to the grub menu and run "Check disc for errors" option. If the file system corruption is serious, the safest option would be to reinstall your system.
|}

== Security Bugs ==
Please see the Ubuntu Security Team's <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/BugTriage|bug triage]]</nowiki> page.

== Added Bugwatch ==
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <tablestyle="background-color: #eee">Thanks for taking the time to report this bug in the upstream bug tracking system this is a tremendous help. Launchpad has the ability to watch lots of upstream bug trackers and this can be done by following the procedure documented at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bugs/Watches. I've added the bug watch for this bug report.
|}

== Hanging Application or Daemon ==
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <tablestyle="background-color: #eee">Thanks for your interest in helping to resolve this issue. In order to get to the bottom of this we need to figure out where the program is hanging. If you can follow the steps on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Backtrace#Already_running_programs and attach the generated text file to this bug it would be of great help.
|}

== User Incorrectly Subscribing a team to a Bug ==
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <tablestyle="background-color: #eee">Thanks for your interest in helping to resolve this issue. There is no need to subscribe anyone to this bug, as it generates unnecessary emails and will not resolve the issue any faster. Your bug will be looked at by a developer as time permits.
|}

== Bug Reported Against Firefox Snap ==
Beginning in Ubuntu 22.04, Firefox is provided as a snap created and published directly by Mozilla. Users, however, can still report against the firefox package directly in launchpad. Apport still warns against this, but launchpad does not. Add this comment (a slight modification of the response from Apport) if the bug mentions occurring in 22.04 (or later) and mark the bug as incomplete. If the user mentions the package as not being a snap, then it's invalid as it came from a source other than Ubuntu or the snap.
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <tablestyle="background-color: #eee">Thank you for taking the time to report this bug and help make Ubuntu better. Firefox is provided by a snap published by Mozilla, and they may not be aware of this issue. Please contact them via https://support.mozilla.org/kb/file-bug-report-or-feature-request-mozilla and link the bug report here so it can be further tracked. Thank you!
|}

== Bug Reported From Unofficial Derivative (not official flavour) ==
Sometimes we will receive bug reports from unofficial derivatives (such as Linux Mint), which we cannot guarantee bugs can be fixed for or can support, so they need to be closed as invalid with this message:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <tablestyle="background-color: #eee">Thank you for taking the time to report this bug and helping to make Ubuntu better. However, per your report, it seems as though you are not actually running Ubuntu but a derivative distribution. Derivatives are not official flavours and may have additional repositories that provide packages that conflict with our official packages, so we cannot provide support or debug when things go wrong in these distributions.<<BR>><<BR>>Official flavours of Ubuntu are listed here: https://ubuntu.com/desktop/flavours <<BR>><<BR>>Please seek support and bug reporting solutions from your distribution. Thank you!
