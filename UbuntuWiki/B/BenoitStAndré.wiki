=== Ldap ssl problem in all Ubuntu distros ===

There seems to be a problem with 
* a very old OpenLdap version which prevents using LDAP_v3 
* all related software not compiled correctly with ssl (php, nscd, ...)

Here are the bug reports related to this. Waiting to do an official bug report very soon on this.

=== Scribus does not work well in every language but english ===

This bug occurs when, in another language (probably another keymap ?) then english, you are trying to modify ANY number in a spinbox whithin Scribus.

This very annoying bug means that you can almost not use Scribus at all for a normal user who wants, for example, to modify the size of a page manually (or to change a font size, or any "number" change).

There is also the original bug in the Scribus bug tracker: http://bugs.scribus.net/view.php?id=3826
