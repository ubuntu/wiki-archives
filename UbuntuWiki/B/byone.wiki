== Who Am I? ==

I'm a Brazilian guy born in Belém, state of Pará, who lives between the state of Espírito Santo (where my family lives) and Rio Grande do Sul (where I live).

I speak a little English and Esperanto, and a little of Libras (Brazilian Sign Language), learned by self-teaching.

== My History With Linux ==

I use GNU / Linux regularly since 1999, starting my use of systems "unix type" with the use of FreeBSD in 1998 and followed by most versions of Debian until 5 past the Red Hat distros, Fedora.

Ubuntu, I met through a friend and partner, who instead of using Debian, Ubuntu chose to use on your netbook. And I have used for testing since then.
