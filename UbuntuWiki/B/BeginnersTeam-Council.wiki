The Ubuntu Beginners Team Council is the group that is ultimately responsible for the governing the IRC channels and interfacing between the Ubuntu Beginners Team and the rest of the Ubuntu community and governance systems.

In order to ensure this, the council will make make all decisions based on feedback  received from the rest of the team via the mailing list and during monthly IRC meetings. Decisions will be made when a majority of the seated council is in agreement.
