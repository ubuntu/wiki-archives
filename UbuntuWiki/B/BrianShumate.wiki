=== FRESH! ===
New stuff I've authored appears here:

nothing "fresh" in quite some time- but, hey, that could change... ;-)

=== About ===
I am just a spring chicken of the ''compuverse'', having only started noodling on computers just over 20 ago with an Apple IIe in elementary school.  Today, I still use an Apple machine to stay in touch with my inner Mac cultist, but I have far more machines which are running free, and open source operating systems, and software within my evil genius lab snuggled away in the vast beautiful Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina, USA. There, I currently reside with my wonderful wife, and two young children.  I also have an official, acrid, and dangerous sense of humor, on loan from an extra-terrestrial being until the year 2020. (hey don't scoff- some people claim to have talent on loan from $DIETY!)

=== Ubuntu Contributions ===
I have only helped out as I can, when I can, but have certainly given far more to Ubuntu than I have any other free, or open source project to date, and I am happy to do so!  In the future, I'd like to contribute more documentation efforts on the Wiki, possibly in the format of simple, step-by-step how-to guides, and finish my book, which has grown to be somewhat Ubuntu-specific at this point.  In the more immediate future, I am launching an Art Project based on Ubuntu.  Stay tuned!
