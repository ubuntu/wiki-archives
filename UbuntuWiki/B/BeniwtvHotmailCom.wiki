Hello.

This page is an open disscusion page. Feel free to add your comments and thoughts to it.

First, my personal Ubuntu history:

When I first got interested in Linux, I tried many, many Linux distriutions out there. One day, I tried Ubuntu (Warty, at that time) and loved it. Don't ask me why - perhaps it's because of it's artwork, simplicity or performance. It's the best Linux I ever seen.
