'''Report'''

Following the last minute withdrawal of Ubuntu-be members, mainly for health reasons, the  Ubuntu-be booth at DIPRO fair Charleroi was organized and manned by members of the local LUG's :

- Peter Lucas, Mark and Cedric Heerbrant Bernard Beekwilder, Bailleux Gilles and Didier Misson (CULButte),

- Pierre Willot of Sambrelug and Namurlug,

- Lawrence Pascozzo of Loligrub. 

CULButte is a group of Linux users ("LUG") from Braine-l'Alleud-Waterloo and surrounding area (Brabant Wallon).

The booth (3 tables) was equipped with 6 laptops. The material supplied by Ubuntu-be (Cedric Janssens) (posters, folders and CDs Ubuntu 9.04) was very well suited to introduce Ubuntu to the public. The lack of preparation has been felt at the animation of the booth through presentations, videos and other promotional materials.

The public was interested, especially in the morning, with multiple questions, sometimes very specific. The atmosphere was nice. Among the questions, several looking for contacts "And in Charleroi, there is a Linux club ? Ubuntu club ?" ... There is a clear demand for more contacts about Linux and Ubuntu in Charleroi area.

Despite a very short preparation, the participation at this fair was an interesting event for the participants and for an active cooperation between Ubuntu-be and LUG's.

Finance: 19 euros for the stand, with 14.50 euros donations. A better presentation of the CD's with appeal for donations would have been more effective to solicit public donations. 

Summary : this was a positive experience. Ubuntu-be should repeat the organization of such events, in Charleroi and elsewhere, with better coordination Ubuntu-be - LUGs and an improved preparation.
