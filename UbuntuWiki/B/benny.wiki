=== Testimonials ===

If you know me and have something nice to say, please leave a comment below.

Benny, or benonsoftware on the IRC, has been a great help in term of classes. I have assisted two of them, and he did a great effort to have very good material, and explain things very clearly. After the oneiric User Days, he wanted to join the Classroom Team. I think *that* is the desire to help the community, and make a better world, going step by step. He really deserves it.

Although I have not been involved with Ben on a specific project, he does seem enthusiastic in Ubuntu-AU events and meetings. Joel Pickett <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~jpickett|~jpickett]]</nowiki>

I've worked with Ben in the Ubuntu Beginners Team - he is a proactive and enthusiastic proponent of Ubuntu. His help with the User Days enables more of those we wish to see using Ubuntu to do so - we need more people to do this. I have no hesitation whatsoever in supporting his application for Ubuntu Membership - <nowiki>[[forestpiskie]]</nowiki>

Hmm, well what to say? Ben gained his full Ubuntu membership, he was offered sponsorship to UDS which because of his age he could not use. He is an admin for <nowiki>[[http://thesii.org/ | The SII]]</nowiki>. He has his own server area to learn and use. But, apart from all of that which he has earned; he is great fun & a seriously dedicated person. I can think of no one who is better placed to get UY back up & running, his humour and drive will filter out to everyone he meets. <nowiki>[[phillw]]</nowiki>
