=== Rolling Release System ===

Rolling release, rolling update, or continuous delivery, in software development, is the concept of frequently delivering updates to applications. This is in contrast to a standard or point release development model which uses software versions that must be reinstalled over the previous version. An example of this difference would be the multiple versions of Ubuntu Linux versus the single, constantly updated version of Arch Linux.

=== Why choose Rolling Release ===

Ubuntu, unlike many distributions, has somewhat outdated software. Even though it is slowly being phased out by the snap system, it has sluggishness which is not accepted by some members of the Ubuntu Community. To fix this, Ubuntu needs to implement the Rolling Release System, which would be beneficial for all members of the Ubuntu Community.
