__TOC__

=== Usage ===
In addition to the self-explanatory <code>--help</code> and <code>--version</code> commands, ''bughelper'' relies on the <code>-p</code> and <code>-l</code> options to process ''packages'' and ''Launchpad URLs'', respectively:

<pre>
   bughelper -p <source package> 
  bughelper -l <Launchpad-URL>
</pre>

<source package> is just the name of a source package in Launchpad such as <code>totem</code>, while the URL can be the result of a search or the list of bugs assigned to a given person or team.

=== Additional options ===

'''-A''' - search in attachments <<BR>>
'''-c''' - case sensitive (off by default) <<BR>>
'''-v''' - also display inherited clues <<BR>>
'''-U''' - also consider upstream bugs <<BR>>
'''-H''' - use all clue files, if no source package specified or no clue file exists <<BR>>
'''-m''' <minimum bug number> - only search in bugs with bug numbers higher than <number> <<BR>>
'''-f''' <filter bugs listed> - filter out certain bugs (also comma-separated lists) <<BR>>
'''-t''' <package> <condition> <info> - try to find the <condition> and display <info> when found (in addition to stored clues) <<BR>>
'''-T''' <package> <condition> <info> - try to find the <condition> and display <info> when found (disregarding stored clues) <<BR>>
'''--format'''=FORMAT - format output type (plain|wiki|html) <<BR>>
'''--gen-config''' - generate default config file <<BR>>

Note: These options are likely to change in future versions of bughelper.
