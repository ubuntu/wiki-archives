I am an IT/Computing student at Kyambogo University, Kampala Uganda.
I am completing my course at the end of May 2010. :-)

I have always been a big fan of GNU/Linux
and Ubuntu was and still is my perfect fit.

I am looking to involve myself more in the Ubuntu development process
than I have been doing.

Open source all the way.
