__TOC__


This is a brief summary of bugs fixed between Ubuntu 18.04.3 and 18.04.4.  '''This summary covers only changes to packages in ''__main__'' and ''__restricted__'', which account for all packages in the officially-supported CD images; there are further changes to various packages in ''universe'' and ''multiverse''.'''  Some of these fixes were by Ubuntu developers directly, while others were by upstream developers and backported to Ubuntu.  For full details, see the individual package changelogs.

In addition to the bugs listed below, this update includes all security updates from the <nowiki>[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/releases/ubuntu-18.04-lts/|Ubuntu Security Notice list]]</nowiki> affecting Ubuntu 18.04 LTS that were released up to and including February 3, 2020.  The last update included was USN-4263-1 (Sudo vulnerability).

=== Installation bug fixes ===

Updated CD images are provided with this release, including fixes for some installation bugs.  (Many installation problems are hardware-specific; for those, see "Hardware support bugs" below.)

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| partman-base
| Bug:1828558
| parted_server.c: Wipe all known superblocks from device in command_new_label.

| livecd-rootfs

|-
| casper
| Bug:1853912

|-
| ubiquity
| Bug:1848880
| d/control: Recommend grub-efi-amd64 or grub-efi-ia32, not the transitional grub-efi which is no longer installed by default.
|-
| casper
| Bug:1840122
| Cherrypick from eoan: Add dependency on finalrd for reliable live-session shutdown. Casper setup live systems do have layering violations (/ actually depends on /cdrom) and it appears that (although masked) the system manages to rip it out, resulting in filesystem errors preventing completing the shutdown. That's where pivot to finalrd comes in, to save the day and blast the running system into oblivion and complete the shutdown.
