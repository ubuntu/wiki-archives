'''Report'''

The booth has been organized as described in this wiki with 5 volunteers (4 Support points (Claudio, Daniel, Enes, Koen ) en Jean), and enough hardware (1 netbook, 2 laptops, 2 PC, one 24"LCD screen (thanks to Guy) and additional material. 

The booth was organized as follow : 
- 1 LCD screen + 1 desktop at the beginning of the booth, with Ubuntu presentation (see wiki : Ubuntu_short_presentation-NL.odp), 
- 1 laptop ready with the demo/presentation "how to use a live-cd", and available for more demo,
- 1 netbook, 1 laptop and 1 PC All-in-screen, with volunteers in front of the tables, giving explanations and demonstrations, distributing flyers and cd's. Despite its small size, the netbook has attracted a lot of curious visitors. 

The Ubuntu-be booth was located in a fairly good place, with easy access and enough place for visitors to walk. The booth (3 tables for the price of 2) was well adapted to our deployment, with enough depth back of the booth. 
The booth was correctly decorated with table cloth, posters, flyers, plastic stands with A4 flyers and A6, an improvised support to fix 2 posters and a Be LoCo Team banner as background of the booth. Working with laptop or netbook on the table is not easy when you and the visitor are standing in front of the table, we used 1 wooden box to elevate 1 laptop ( ± 30 cm high). We should find other easy solution. 
There was no WiFi, but we used a Telenet hotspot thanks to Daniel. 

We distributed approximatively 120 flyers, 40 information sheets, 80 sheets about the use of live-cd's and 90 cd's Ubuntu 9.04 (+ a few other versions), always on request of interested persons and after explanation. With a stock of 20 original cd's and 20 home-burned cd's, we had to burn 50 cd's and used home-printed CD sleeves. 

Generally visitors knew about Ubuntu and were interested by additional information. Some people did not know about the existence of Ubuntu.. From 10.30 to 14.00 h. : many interested visitors, we were permanently busy with questions, explanations and demonstrations (full manning of the booth!). From 14.00 to 16.00 h. : less public, but permanently visitors with questions. 

Like in previous fairs, we had contacts with people teaching Linux-Ubuntu in their environment : it could be useful to create a team or sub-team "Ubuntu in education" that could support teachers, especially if they are teaching (and promoting) Ubuntu, with their experience.

Frequently asked questions were :
- the use of Ubuntu and Windows on a PC (dual boot),
- how to work with a live-cd,
- the step “Partitioning a HD – where to install Ubuntu” during the install process.

We used 2 presentations (screenshots "how to use a live-cd" and the installation process (thanks Daniel) ) in support of explanations. 
A presentation of the step "manually partitioning"  (a few screenshots) should be useful. We had no documentation (paper) about the installation of a dual-boot Ubuntu-Vista, to support the (verbal) explanation.

To constitute the team, 20 support points of Hasselt area were contacted, with 6 answers and 4 volunteers effectively involved in the booth. The BitMappers local computer club was not present in the fair.

Finance : 80 euro public gifts, minus booth fee 38 euro, 1x50 cd's (13 euro), 1 x 100 cd sleeves (2,50 euro). The remaining 26,50 euro will be transferred to Ubuntu-be account by Jean7491. 
The remaining stock of blanco cd's and cd sleeves will be used in the next events. 

''Summary'' 

It was a successful event for Ubuntu promotion in Hasselt area, with 4 new motivated volunteers (and 2 other positive contacts). 

There is a possibility to participate to the Genk Dipro fair on 06/12/2009 if we succeed to find a leader and to provide enough support to a local team.

We need boxes to elevate the laptops and netbooks for an easier use,  supports for posters, a presentation with screenshots of the installation of Ubuntu and a document about the installation of Ubuntu in dual-boot with Vista (and Windows 7).
