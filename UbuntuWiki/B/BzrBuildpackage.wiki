__TOC__


In ubuntu we now have a bzr plugin which makes building packages maintained in a bzr branch easier. This page describes how to use it.  For a more general overview, see the documentation for <nowiki>[[DistributedDevelopment-Documentation|Distributed Development]]</nowiki>.

== Installation ==

The plugin is available in the 'bzr-builddeb' package in both Ubuntu and Debian. As well as
the Distributed Development documentation linked above you can read the user manual at
<nowiki>[[http://jameswestby.net/bzr/builddeb/user_manual/]]</nowiki>
