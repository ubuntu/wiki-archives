__TOC__

I'm thinking of using this table for the !LoCo's to figure what time, date, category, or tag that they want to focus on during the Global Jam 2014.  Any pages that will be marked for deletion will be on a Google Doc spreadsheet or a wiki page, unless there is a wiki admin on during the jam.  Also, there should be at least one Ubuntu Doc team member that knows how things are ran to help out.  Also, at least one member of the !LoCo should be connected to the doc team's IRC channel.
