[Tue Aug  5 23:05:56 2008] <bodhi_zazen> OK

[Tue Aug  5 23:05:59 2008] <Rocket2DMn> wiki team: meeting 2 weeks from today

[Tue Aug  5 23:06:10 2008] <nhandler> I am representing the Education focus group

[Tue Aug  5 23:06:11 2008] <bodhi_zazen> I would like to encourage anyone interested in wiki to pitch in

[Tue Aug  5 23:06:21 2008] <Old_Soldier> +1 we need the help

[Tue Aug  5 23:06:22 2008] <bodhi_zazen> consider staerting with the BT FAQ

[Tue Aug  5 23:06:24 2008] <nhandler> We (paultag and I) have been working on creating a mentoring program for the fg

[Tue Aug  5 23:06:26 2008] <alanmun> +1 we do need help

[Tue Aug  5 23:06:26 2008] <Rocket2DMn> if you have questions or interest about the wiki, speak to me after the meeting

[Tue Aug  5 23:06:35 2008] <bodhi_zazen> OK

[Tue Aug  5 23:06:40 2008] <bodhi_zazen> education team then :

[Tue Aug  5 23:06:49 2008] <nhandler> In order to make sure that everyone is able to benefit from the conversations between the mentor and mentee, email logs will be kept

[Tue Aug  5 23:07:07 2008] <bodhi_zazen> how ?

[Tue Aug  5 23:07:08 2008] <m_newton> i think i have joined the education team.... have i?

[Tue Aug  5 23:07:21 2008] <m_newton> i want to

[Tue Aug  5 23:07:28 2008] <nhandler> Conversations between the mentor and mentee will be CCed to a certain email address

[Tue Aug  5 23:07:33 2008] <LeAstrale> m_newton: afterwards dude!

[Tue Aug  5 23:07:36 2008] <PrivateVoid> why not just have a mentor / mentee forum then?

[Tue Aug  5 23:07:40 2008] <nhandler> They will be able to use <private> tags to keep certain parts private

[Tue Aug  5 23:07:57 2008] <bodhi_zazen> nhandler, is it in place yet ?

[Tue Aug  5 23:08:03 2008] <nhandler> PrivateVoid: Because you don't get the same personal touch in a forum

[Tue Aug  5 23:08:12 2008] <m_newton> true

[Tue Aug  5 23:08:14 2008] <nhandler> bodhi_zazen: Not yet. We are still working on the perl script to parse the email

[Tue Aug  5 23:08:23 2008] <alanmun> I know everyones antsy in their seats but i do repeat again, lets try to keep the unneccessary comments that dont need immediate addressing till after meeting :)

[Tue Aug  5 23:08:23 2008] <bodhi_zazen> I suggest we use the BT sub fourm then

[Tue Aug  5 23:08:24 2008] <nhandler> Hopefully we will get it up in the next month

[Tue Aug  5 23:08:45 2008] <m_newton> ... but till then?

[Tue Aug  5 23:08:52 2008] <nhandler> I still don't think a forum is the right way to go about this, I think email would work much better

[Tue Aug  5 23:08:55 2008] <st33med> Hey, I just realized there is a meeting right now >.<

[Tue Aug  5 23:08:56 2008] <m_newton> lets use a temporay fourme

[Tue Aug  5 23:09:02 2008] <vor> nhandler: I'm not completely sure I agree but, we can talk offline about it.  Forums are indexed.  I'd rather see a mentor/mentee thing that gets posted publicly on a wiki.

[Tue Aug  5 23:09:09 2008] <alanmun> (just trying to speed up the meeting and help the ones who are logging)

[Tue Aug  5 23:09:15 2008] <bodhi_zazen> +1 vor

[Tue Aug  5 23:09:19 2008] <bodhi_zazen> I think forums as well

[Tue Aug  5 23:09:20 2008] <nhandler> vor: It will all be archived to a public place

[Tue Aug  5 23:09:29 2008] <bodhi_zazen> that way all can benefit :)

[Tue Aug  5 23:09:43 2008] <Bodsda> wb tronyx

[Tue Aug  5 23:09:47 2008] <bodhi_zazen> we can discuss it later too

[Tue Aug  5 23:09:49 2008] <vor> Right.  It's the same mentality as "No support via PM".

[Tue Aug  5 23:09:51 2008] <tronyx> ty

[Tue Aug  5 23:09:53 2008] <nhandler> bodhi_zazen: We are being very careful to make sure everyone is able to share in the information that is exchanged between the mentor/mentee

[Tue Aug  5 23:09:56 2008] <tronyx> eating dinner but keeping an eye on the channel

[Tue Aug  5 23:10:08 2008] <nhandler> But we can discuss this further after the meeting. You can move on.

[Tue Aug  5 23:10:16 2008] <PrivateVoid> alanmun, we should use Roberts Rules?

[Tue Aug  5 23:10:17 2008] <vor> nhandler: Yeah, let's do that.

[Tue Aug  5 23:10:18 2008] <bodhi_zazen> OK, thanks nhandler

[Tue Aug  5 23:10:30 2008] <bodhi_zazen> any other education issues ?

[Tue Aug  5 23:10:43 2008] <alanmun> I dont see why that wouldnt help :) hehe

[Tue Aug  5 23:10:43 2008] <nhandler> No. That is all bodhi_zazen

[Tue Aug  5 23:10:48 2008] <m_newton> :]

[Tue Aug  5 23:10:56 2008] <m_newton> need more mentors+ topics

[Tue Aug  5 23:11:05 2008] <bodhi_zazen> OK, I would hope the education team can gear up a little

[Tue Aug  5 23:11:08 2008] <m_newton> + brodcating this to the world

[Tue Aug  5 23:11:10 2008] <bodhi_zazen> we have some new users

[Tue Aug  5 23:11:18 2008] <m_newton> :0

[Tue Aug  5 23:11:23 2008] <bodhi_zazen> OK, LP

[Tue Aug  5 23:11:30 2008] <bodhi_zazen> any issues with LP ?

[Tue Aug  5 23:11:38 2008] <alanmun> none afaik

[Tue Aug  5 23:11:42 2008] <bodhi_zazen> forums seem to be going well

[Tue Aug  5 23:11:52 2008] <alanmun> forums are nice and pretty :D

[Tue Aug  5 23:12:10 2008] <bodhi_zazen> OK, next item, team avatar ....

[Tue Aug  5 23:12:20 2008] <Bodsda> bodhi_zazen, irc?

[Tue Aug  5 23:12:22 2008] <bodhi_zazen> Old_Soldier, anything to discuss ?

[Tue Aug  5 23:12:32 2008] <bodhi_zazen> sec Bodsda

[Tue Aug  5 23:12:39 2008] <m_newton> i suggest somesort of a compiled list of places one can go to get some sort of information

[Tue Aug  5 23:12:43 2008] <Bodsda> k

[Tue Aug  5 23:13:04 2008] <Old_Soldier> It has been suggested that we approach the FC for a team avatar. if this is granted we would have one in the same way as staff or Ubuntu members.

[Tue Aug  5 23:13:09 2008] <m_newton> for example... if i wanted to know what the wiki was,... i need to remember only one site

[Tue Aug  5 23:13:12 2008] <PrivateVoid> FC?

[Tue Aug  5 23:13:18 2008] <m_newton> One site describs all

[Tue Aug  5 23:13:24 2008] <st33med> :P

[Tue Aug  5 23:13:29 2008] <m_newton> like an index of BT

[Tue Aug  5 23:13:29 2008] <Old_Soldier> this avatar would "brand" us and would be issued by the forum admins

[Tue Aug  5 23:13:34 2008] <alanmun> guys lets try not to talk over eachother ;)

[Tue Aug  5 23:13:34 2008] <Old_Soldier> FC= forum council

[Tue Aug  5 23:13:42 2008] <bodhi_zazen> I am OK with that

[Tue Aug  5 23:13:45 2008] <PrivateVoid> I like the idea Old_Soldier -- what of BT members that are also Moderators and such?

[Tue Aug  5 23:13:50 2008] <st33med> Unique badge?

[Tue Aug  5 23:13:52 2008] <st33med> Watermarks

[Tue Aug  5 23:13:53 2008] <st33med> ?

[Tue Aug  5 23:13:55 2008] <bodhi_zazen> Old_Soldier, I suggest we post on chit-chat

[Tue Aug  5 23:14:01 2008] <PrivateVoid> Would they get multiple badgest or something?

[Tue Aug  5 23:14:08 2008] <st33med> BEAN BADGES

[Tue Aug  5 23:14:12 2008] <st33med> :D

[Tue Aug  5 23:14:23 2008] <Old_Soldier> private void there is no way to implement what you request

[Tue Aug  5 23:14:23 2008] <alanmun> the badges like ubuntu members get :)

[Tue Aug  5 23:14:46 2008] <PrivateVoid> I have no request... just curious how it would work

[Tue Aug  5 23:14:50 2008] <PrivateVoid> take you...

[Tue Aug  5 23:14:55 2008] <PrivateVoid> you are BT and MOd

[Tue Aug  5 23:14:57 2008] <vor> Old_Soldier: Doesn't vorian have 2 tags?

[Tue Aug  5 23:14:58 2008] <st33med> hrm.... Badges seem like a good feature for the forums, but, it would be hard to implement

[Tue Aug  5 23:15:02 2008] <bodhi_zazen> I like the idea to a general theme and users may use as is or modify

[Tue Aug  5 23:15:19 2008] <bodhi_zazen> I do not mind non-team members using it, so long as it is not abused

[Tue Aug  5 23:15:29 2008] <bodhi_zazen> If it is abused -> report post / user

[Tue Aug  5 23:15:34 2008] <y_lee> +1 bodhi_zazen

[Tue Aug  5 23:15:36 2008] <Rocket2DMn> where do you draw the line for abuse

[Tue Aug  5 23:15:38 2008] <st33med> Different color info tag on post (The brown box with pic)?

[Tue Aug  5 23:15:46 2008] <jamesrfla> 1+ bodhi_zazen

[Tue Aug  5 23:15:47 2008] <bodhi_zazen> less admin, less hassle, more advertisement

[Tue Aug  5 23:16:15 2008] <st33med> bodhi_zazen, Different color info tag on post (The brown box with pic)?

[Tue Aug  5 23:16:30 2008] <bodhi_zazen> Abuse, IMO, is when someone claims deep knowledge of Ubuntu & justifies it with a BT avatar :)

[Tue Aug  5 23:16:31 2008] <bodhi_zazen> lol

[Tue Aug  5 23:16:31 2008] <paultag> ok guys I made it

[Tue Aug  5 23:16:38 2008] <st33med> XD

[Tue Aug  5 23:16:43 2008] <Old_Soldier> I just wanted to bring it up for discussion, we don't need to go with an official avatar if you feel it would make us seem unapproachable or "uppity"

[Tue Aug  5 23:16:49 2008] <alanmun> haha bodhi :D

[Tue Aug  5 23:16:49 2008] <vor> I'm not opposed to something like an Ubuntu Member kind of badge for BT members but, I like the avatar that PrivateVoid made and I think that identifies us pretty well.

[Tue Aug  5 23:17:08 2008] <nhandler> vor: The issue with that avatar is that anybody can use it.

[Tue Aug  5 23:17:18 2008] <bodhi_zazen> I think a few more frames / colors and we would be good to go

[Tue Aug  5 23:17:27 2008] <bodhi_zazen> templates need to be in gimp ?

[Tue Aug  5 23:17:29 2008] <st33med> bodhi_zazen, exactly my thoughts

[Tue Aug  5 23:17:39 2008] <PrivateVoid> yes... templates in gimp and .psd

[Tue Aug  5 23:17:41 2008] <LeAstrale> +1 on frames

[Tue Aug  5 23:17:42 2008] <Rocket2DMn> I don't think the FC would approve of bean badges, I thought this had been discussed before.  I think we are better off with themed avatars that we can modify ourselves

[Tue Aug  5 23:17:50 2008] <st33med> m_newton, ummm....

[Tue Aug  5 23:17:53 2008] <m_newton> PrivateVoid: i can help with tha

[Tue Aug  5 23:17:54 2008] <Bodsda> bodhi_zazen, not necessarily in gimp, but needs to be in a multi-layered format

[Tue Aug  5 23:17:54 2008] <bodhi_zazen> +1 Rocket2DMn

[Tue Aug  5 23:17:57 2008] <paultag> Rocket2DMn++;

[Tue Aug  5 23:18:11 2008] <bodhi_zazen> Bodsda, GIMP

[Tue Aug  5 23:18:11 2008] <vor> nhandler: Sure, they can, but, several BT members are also mods and so using it would cause a polite PM to them saying, "Knock it off".

[Tue Aug  5 23:18:12 2008] <bodhi_zazen> lol

[Tue Aug  5 23:18:15 2008] <m_newton> I took a cource in PHOTOSHOP and have access to it

[Tue Aug  5 23:18:17 2008] <tinivole> nhandler, we can work around that issue :)

[Tue Aug  5 23:18:17 2008] <alanmun> well, if we move/delete the post and just keep the frame file on a text file in one of our computers till we get a new team member..i think that would work better than having the file available in that post on team avatar theme.

[Tue Aug  5 23:18:20 2008] <m_newton> i can do it

[Tue Aug  5 23:18:27 2008] <Rocket2DMn> vor, that is also creating more work for ourselves

[Tue Aug  5 23:18:34 2008] <Old_Soldier> I believe we had this discussion in the past Rocket2DMn , but it never got cleared from the agenda. shall we close it and go with themed avatars instead?

[Tue Aug  5 23:18:35 2008] <Bodsda> bodhi_zazen, sorry, was generalizing, but multi layered is important for modification to the banner/border

[Tue Aug  5 23:18:39 2008] <nhandler> vor: Well the moderators could simply use the avatar that PrivateVoid made

[Tue Aug  5 23:18:40 2008] <alanmun> I mean the frame URL

[Tue Aug  5 23:18:43 2008] <bodhi_zazen> yes

[Tue Aug  5 23:19:00 2008] <bodhi_zazen> no, post templates on forums

[Tue Aug  5 23:19:28 2008] <st33med> Post templates +1

[Tue Aug  5 23:19:29 2008] <m_newton> ok

[Tue Aug  5 23:19:33 2008] <m_newton> +1

[Tue Aug  5 23:19:38 2008] <PrivateVoid> I will post the templates

[Tue Aug  5 23:19:41 2008] <bodhi_zazen> I do not like the idea of the BT avatar becoing some private club or ego thing, lol

[Tue Aug  5 23:19:45 2008] <PrivateVoid> Just have to make them

[Tue Aug  5 23:19:50 2008] <vor> Rocket2DMn: Not likely.  The average user would find it hard to integrate the BT logo into their avatar (I found it hard).

[Tue Aug  5 23:20:00 2008] <bodhi_zazen> And otheres can make / submit too :)

[Tue Aug  5 23:20:00 2008] <m_newton> if we did it so .... your level of expertise raised your color that it would be awesome

[Tue Aug  5 23:20:22 2008] <st33med> Yeah, no one has made the source of the frame public YET

[Tue Aug  5 23:20:23 2008] <Bodsda> m_newton, i dont like that idea

[Tue Aug  5 23:20:28 2008] <m_newton> y not

[Tue Aug  5 23:20:29 2008] <bodhi_zazen> any other team avatar thoughts ?

[Tue Aug  5 23:20:30 2008] <LeAstrale> m_newton: it would be too much administration and who should handle it

[Tue Aug  5 23:20:36 2008] <PrivateVoid> st33med -- the source of the frame is posted...

[Tue Aug  5 23:20:40 2008] <st33med> GAH

[Tue Aug  5 23:20:41 2008] <Bodsda> m_newton, then as bodhi_zazen mentioned, it may become an ego trip

[Tue Aug  5 23:22:24 2008] <Rocket2DMn> Can we please move on from this topic.  I think the general agreement is that the Forum Council won't approve a bean badge for a team they don't have direct control over and create more work for themselves, esp. when users come and go.  This team is not as formal a process as being an Ubuntu member

[Tue Aug  5 23:23:35 2008] <nhandler> st33med: I am working on making it threaded

[Tue Aug  5 23:23:45 2008] <Rocket2DMn> i think we need to do all votes privately in PM, that is ridiculous

[Tue Aug  5 23:23:49 2008] <bodhi_zazen> Next, Old_Soldier wiki cleanup ???

[Tue Aug  5 23:23:53 2008] <m_newton> true

[Tue Aug  5 23:24:07 2008] <LeAstrale> +1 Rocket2DMn

[Tue Aug  5 23:24:18 2008] <Old_Soldier> I have a proposal for an additional step to the vetting of new members to the BT

[Tue Aug  5 23:24:19 2008] <bodhi_zazen> Will vote bot do that ?

[Tue Aug  5 23:24:26 2008] <tinivole> Rocket2DMn, nathan has already been testing that, and a function does exist, just that bodhi didn't enable it

[Tue Aug  5 23:24:29 2008] <nhandler> Will VoteBot do what?

[Tue Aug  5 23:24:37 2008] <Bodsda> privmsg vote

[Tue Aug  5 23:24:40 2008] <alanmun> private votes yes

[Tue Aug  5 23:24:42 2008] <m_newton> yup

[Tue Aug  5 23:24:45 2008] <vor> I think the default should be private vote

[Tue Aug  5 23:24:45 2008] <nhandler> Yes. Just use the --msg option

[Tue Aug  5 23:25:02 2008] <vor> Better to have a --public option

[Tue Aug  5 23:25:07 2008] <PrivateVoid> I agree Old_Soldier it is necessary... my latest two padawans did not stick around long enough...

[Tue Aug  5 23:25:14 2008] <Old_Soldier> What I propose is that in addition to the quiz, potential members demonstrate their proficiency by cleaning and expanding a page in the community wiki

[Tue Aug  5 23:25:18 2008] <m_newton> PrivateVoid: hey

[Tue Aug  5 23:25:23 2008] <PrivateVoid> so asking a little bit more would be a good thing.

[Tue Aug  5 23:25:33 2008] <PrivateVoid> m_newton, you stayed around... but you are not my latest two.

[Tue Aug  5 23:25:37 2008] <Old_Soldier> its a good indicator of thier commitment as well

[Tue Aug  5 23:25:42 2008] <m_newton> oh

[Tue Aug  5 23:25:49 2008] <Bodsda> Old_Soldier, some users may not feel comfortable editing pages, also they'd have to have an LP account

[Tue Aug  5 23:25:57 2008] <Rocket2DMn> If we implement Old_Soldier 's proposal.  The wiki page needs to be approved in advance by the team or Master, then approved after the work is completed.

[Tue Aug  5 23:25:58 2008] <bodhi_zazen> Old_Soldier, I would like to table the discussion to later, in the new members portion of the meeting

[Tue Aug  5 23:25:59 2008] <m_newton> Old_Soldier: Who will be incharge of that

[Tue Aug  5 23:26:01 2008] <alanmun> +1 with that Bodsda

[Tue Aug  5 23:26:04 2008] <tinivole> m_newton, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Beginners/BTMeetings

[Tue Aug  5 23:26:08 2008] <paultag> Rocket2DMn: MOTU style

[Tue Aug  5 23:26:08 2008] <m_newton> how will we measure profincy

[Tue Aug  5 23:26:12 2008] <PrivateVoid> Bodsda -- that may be true, but I think they need to do something...

[Tue Aug  5 23:26:17 2008] <nhandler> I don't think making padawans edit a wiki page should be a requirement

[Tue Aug  5 23:26:20 2008] <m_newton> +1 Old_Soldier i like ur idea

[Tue Aug  5 23:26:21 2008] <PrivateVoid> to show they are going to contribute.

[Tue Aug  5 23:26:33 2008] <nhandler> Not everyone chooses to contribute to the wiki fg

[Tue Aug  5 23:26:33 2008] <m_newton> How do we show contribution

[Tue Aug  5 23:26:34 2008] <Bodsda> PrivateVoid, something yes, but i think it needs discussing later in the appropriate section of the meeting

[Tue Aug  5 23:26:35 2008] <bodhi_zazen> OK, lets do it now, new user mentoring ...

[Tue Aug  5 23:26:35 2008] <st33med> I need help understanding what a padawan is....

[Tue Aug  5 23:26:36 2008] <jamesrfla> 1-

[Tue Aug  5 23:26:36 2008] <bodhi_zazen> lol

[Tue Aug  5 23:26:38 2008] <Ajzimmerman> Does anybody use ndiswrapper ??

[Tue Aug  5 23:26:44 2008] <Old_Soldier> I agree. lets table this until later in the meeting

[Tue Aug  5 23:26:51 2008] <st33med> Ajzimmerman, you need help? Go to ##beginners-help

[Tue Aug  5 23:26:51 2008] <nhandler> bodhi_zazen: We already covered new user mentoring

[Tue Aug  5 23:26:53 2008] <PrivateVoid> perhaps we can make it 1, 2, or 3 different things, but I think we need something

[Tue Aug  5 23:26:56 2008] <Rocket2DMn> Ajzimmerman, we are having a meeting, please take your questions to #ubuntu or ##beginners-help

[Tue Aug  5 23:27:02 2008] <bodhi_zazen> Ajzimmerman, take support questons elsewhere during meeting please

[Tue Aug  5 23:27:16 2008] <m_newton> FORMAL QUESTION: how do we show contribution: there must be a set way as i THIS is how... and we need mentors to show that 2

[Tue Aug  5 23:27:30 2008] <Bodsda> +1

[Tue Aug  5 23:27:30 2008] <bodhi_zazen> I think we should :

[Tue Aug  5 23:27:34 2008] <paultag> bodhi_zazen:

[Tue Aug  5 23:27:35 2008] <bodhi_zazen> 1. Welcome new users

[Tue Aug  5 23:27:40 2008] <Rocket2DMn> I think we need to lay out exactly what the role of a Master is

[Tue Aug  5 23:27:43 2008] <PrivateVoid> m_newton, usually forum posts... since this team is forum based

[Tue Aug  5 23:27:44 2008] <bodhi_zazen> 2. Quiz the ones who stay a while

[Tue Aug  5 23:27:45 2008] <paultag> Rocket2DMn:

[Tue Aug  5 23:27:49 2008] <PrivateVoid> and being here in channel

[Tue Aug  5 23:27:59 2008] <bodhi_zazen> 3. After quiz, expect them to establish with a mentor

[Tue Aug  5 23:28:00 2008] <paultag> bodhi_zazen: the master padawan IMHO should be absorbed by the Edu team

[Tue Aug  5 23:28:01 2008] <m_newton> OK so we need to make that official

[Tue Aug  5 23:28:02 2008] <Bodsda> PrivateVoid, i am irc based and do foruming when i can though

[Tue Aug  5 23:28:16 2008] <m_newton> i am usually on IRC doing nothing thinking i am contributing :p

[Tue Aug  5 23:28:20 2008] <bodhi_zazen> It is they up to the mentor to determine when they are eligable for membership

[Tue Aug  5 23:28:24 2008] <paultag> bodhi_zazen: this is where I want to take the group, and nhandler has been helping

[Tue Aug  5 23:28:54 2008] <bodhi_zazen> This way they are screened by Quiz and time in channel

[Tue Aug  5 23:28:59 2008] <paultag> bodhi_zazen: and have the Edu team focus on checking the level of experence of the user

[Tue Aug  5 23:29:02 2008] <m_newton> bodhi_zazen: Can we vote on the primary method of contribution bieng Fourms and write that on the Wiki

[Tue Aug  5 23:29:08 2008] <vor> bodhi_zazen: I like that.  If you take a padawan, YOU decide when they are ready to voted on.  It's not simply a courtesy but, an actual evaluation to see if they would fit with the team.

[Tue Aug  5 23:29:11 2008] <bodhi_zazen> without having to establish mentors on casual transients

[Tue Aug  5 23:30:01 2008] <bodhi_zazen> BUT I do not favor an immediate establishment of mentors

[Tue Aug  5 23:30:12 2008] <Hellow> what did i miss?

[Tue Aug  5 23:30:12 2008] <bodhi_zazen> I say quiz them first, see if they stay a while

[Tue Aug  5 23:30:13 2008] <paultag> bodhi_zazen: I agree -- we need to be sure they stay around

[Tue Aug  5 23:30:14 2008] <m_newton> Do WE NEED to re-evaluate our members

[Tue Aug  5 23:30:18 2008] <tinivole> lmao vor...

[Tue Aug  5 23:30:22 2008] <Bodsda> bodhi_zazen, what do you mean? elaborate please

[Tue Aug  5 23:30:27 2008] <Bodsda> o i c

[Tue Aug  5 23:30:35 2008] <bodhi_zazen> We get a lot of transients

[Tue Aug  5 23:30:46 2008] <bodhi_zazen> PrivateVoid, lost 2 padawan

[Tue Aug  5 23:30:54 2008] <bodhi_zazen> too much effort for PrivateVoid

[Tue Aug  5 23:30:55 2008] <m_newton> i favor  immediate establishment of mentors as well

[Tue Aug  5 23:30:57 2008] <Joeb454> we do indeed

[Tue Aug  5 23:31:00 2008] <nhandler> I think we also need to clarify the requirements for membership

[Tue Aug  5 23:31:01 2008] <paultag> m_newton: I do not

[Tue Aug  5 23:31:07 2008] <Bodsda> ive seen too many names on the nominations that ive never seen in this channel

[Tue Aug  5 23:31:10 2008] <paultag> nhandler: indeed

[Tue Aug  5 23:31:25 2008] <m_newton> bodhi_zazen: I think if they knew there duty... as in how to contribute... they would stay longer

[Tue Aug  5 23:31:49 2008] <paultag> bodhi_zazen: ok might I propose something:

[Tue Aug  5 23:31:51 2008] <bodhi_zazen> I don't know about that ...

[Tue Aug  5 23:31:54 2008] <alanmun> +1 bodsda

[Tue Aug  5 23:32:02 2008] <paultag> bodhi_zazen: User requests to join, comes into IRC

[Tue Aug  5 23:32:15 2008] <paultag> bodhi_zazen: Given a few hazing tasks, i.e. Wiki

[Tue Aug  5 23:32:15 2008] <PrivateVoid> bodhi_zazen, it was not too much effort...

[Tue Aug  5 23:32:18 2008] <Rocket2DMn> Do we need to make it a requirement that team members use IRC on a fairly regular basis?  Otherwise we basically lose track of them

[Tue Aug  5 23:32:21 2008] <alanmun> they should all have a um "evaluation" period imo.

[Tue Aug  5 23:32:28 2008] <paultag> bodhi_zazen: if they stay around, we can assign a mentor from the edu team

[Tue Aug  5 23:32:28 2008] <PrivateVoid> they simply stopped coming to our channel after I showed them our ropes

[Tue Aug  5 23:32:34 2008] <nhandler> I think IRC needs to be a requirement Rocket2DMn

[Tue Aug  5 23:32:36 2008] <Bodsda> i think so Rocket2DMn

[Tue Aug  5 23:32:38 2008] <PrivateVoid> and did not communicate to me that they had changed their mind

[Tue Aug  5 23:32:42 2008] <paultag> bodhi_zazen: we evaluate, then give the test

[Tue Aug  5 23:32:47 2008] <PrivateVoid> bodhi_zazen, I do not mind making the effort at all.

[Tue Aug  5 23:33:16 2008] <bodhi_zazen> I think the criteria for membership is basically :

[Tue Aug  5 23:33:18 2008] <vor> I honestly think members should be recommended by example.  I think that's where we've had the best luck.

[Tue Aug  5 23:33:19 2008] <bodhi_zazen> 1. They irc

[Tue Aug  5 23:33:20 2008] <alanmun> Druui we are having an official meeting :)

[Tue Aug  5 23:33:20 2008] <tinivole> jacob, probably got mixed up with james again ;_

[Tue Aug  5 23:33:40 2008] <bodhi_zazen> 3. they want to deepen involvement in Ubuntu

[Tue Aug  5 23:33:43 2008] <bodhi_zazen> so ...

[Tue Aug  5 23:33:44 2008] <Druui> hi Bodhi_zazen

[Tue Aug  5 23:33:47 2008] <LeAstrale> tinivole: he did yes :/

[Tue Aug  5 23:33:48 2008] <bodhi_zazen> I think :

[Tue Aug  5 23:33:54 2008] <jamesrfla> +1bodh

[Tue Aug  5 23:33:54 2008] <Druui> hi all

[Tue Aug  5 23:33:55 2008] <nhandler> bodhi_zazen: What about the quiz and nomination?

[Tue Aug  5 23:34:01 2008] <bodhi_zazen> 1. Let them come to IRC

[Tue Aug  5 23:34:05 2008] <Hellow> Druui: they are doing a meeting

[Tue Aug  5 23:34:11 2008] <PrivateVoid> I think we need to have people 'welcomed'

[Tue Aug  5 23:34:11 2008] <m_newton> k

[Tue Aug  5 23:34:16 2008] <bodhi_zazen> 2. Let me quiz them at some point

[Tue Aug  5 23:34:16 2008] <PrivateVoid> then 'shown the ropes'

[Tue Aug  5 23:34:24 2008] <PrivateVoid> then evaluated by their 'master'

[Tue Aug  5 23:34:33 2008] <bodhi_zazen> If they stay they will develop a mentroing relationship

[Tue Aug  5 23:34:34 2008] <Druui> i has to reinstall xp this morning.. i thought i has conpisracy theoryt hat emachine cripple my memory sdram number upon partitioning. turn out it is a bad card. sillyme

[Tue Aug  5 23:34:36 2008] <PrivateVoid> then, if ready, nominated for a vote by 'masters'

[Tue Aug  5 23:34:36 2008] <LeAstrale> bodhi_zazen: i suggest we maybe have 2 people with the quizzes?

[Tue Aug  5 23:34:42 2008] <bodhi_zazen> I have never regretted letting time pass

[Tue Aug  5 23:34:44 2008] <Druui> now i has less than 1 gb than 4 gb total heh

[Tue Aug  5 23:34:47 2008] <jamesrfla> +1 bodhi_zazen

[Tue Aug  5 23:34:58 2008] <Rocket2DMn> Druui, we are having a meeting, please take your questions if #ubuntu or ##beginners-help

[Tue Aug  5 23:34:58 2008] <m_newton> LeAstrale: agree

[Tue Aug  5 23:35:09 2008] <Druui> ah i dont have the questions atm, Rocket

[Tue Aug  5 23:35:11 2008] <PrivateVoid> the two padawan I lost were worth my efforts... but they just drifted away

[Tue Aug  5 23:35:13 2008] <Bodsda> what if we had a python script questionnaire, that they downloaded took then the answers are emailed to there master

[Tue Aug  5 23:35:15 2008] <LeAstrale> bodhi_zazen: because at times it seems alot of people log on expecting to find you and when they don't they get dissapointed

[Tue Aug  5 23:35:18 2008] <Druui> meeting is underway now? sorry about that

[Tue Aug  5 23:35:20 2008] <bodhi_zazen> OK, we can have say vor, me, and paultag quiz

[Tue Aug  5 23:35:32 2008] <bodhi_zazen> anyone eles interested ?

[Tue Aug  5 23:35:33 2008] <st33med> What do we mentor about?

[Tue Aug  5 23:35:34 2008] <alanmun> Druui, and also general chatter should be sent elsewhere as well :)

[Tue Aug  5 23:35:36 2008] <Rocket2DMn> i think quizzes need to be done here in the channel

[Tue Aug  5 23:35:36 2008] <paultag> bodhi_zazen: for sure

[Tue Aug  5 23:35:39 2008] <bodhi_zazen> in quizzing ?

[Tue Aug  5 23:35:43 2008] <Rocket2DMn> too much is lost by email

[Tue Aug  5 23:35:43 2008] <alanmun> i will!

[Tue Aug  5 23:35:44 2008] <alanmun> :D

[Tue Aug  5 23:35:46 2008] <PrivateVoid> I think quizzes should be scheduled bodhi_zazen

[Tue Aug  5 23:35:46 2008] <jamesrfla> I am but you know where I am at bodhi_zazen

[Tue Aug  5 23:35:46 2008] <tinivole> bodhi_zazen, I can

[Tue Aug  5 23:35:48 2008] <Druui> heh alan. now i will be quiet now.

[Tue Aug  5 23:35:49 2008] <PrivateVoid> not just login and get one

[Tue Aug  5 23:35:51 2008] <LeAstrale> bodhi_zazen: i'd say vor, Joeb454 and maybe paultag ?

[Tue Aug  5 23:35:52 2008] <m_newton> -1 Bodsda Thats too complicated

[Tue Aug  5 23:35:54 2008] <Joeb454> bodhi_zazen, what kind of questions?

[Tue Aug  5 23:35:56 2008] <Old_Soldier> I am not opposed to having designated examiners lol

[Tue Aug  5 23:35:57 2008] <PrivateVoid> I can assist with quizzes though

[Tue Aug  5 23:35:58 2008] <m_newton> no one will join

[Tue Aug  5 23:35:59 2008] <Bodsda> m_newton, i could write it

[Tue Aug  5 23:36:07 2008] <Joeb454> PrivateVoid, I like the idea of scheduled quizzes

[Tue Aug  5 23:36:08 2008] <st33med> I needs a padawan

[Tue Aug  5 23:36:14 2008] <m_newton> ya... but if i had to download something...

[Tue Aug  5 23:36:14 2008] <bodhi_zazen> The other option is I quiz all

[Tue Aug  5 23:36:22 2008] <bodhi_zazen> That has 2 advantages :

[Tue Aug  5 23:36:22 2008] <paultag> st33med: talk to me later about joining the edu team mentor program

[Tue Aug  5 23:36:24 2008] <vor> bodhi_zazen: I agree.  I actually thinks the best padawans are those that are invited by other members.  That's not to say that others aren't also very good but, the ones that are invited have proven themselves.  The ones that haven't been need to show commitement.

[Tue Aug  5 23:36:27 2008] <bodhi_zazen> 1. it is uniform

[Tue Aug  5 23:36:27 2008] <st33med> kays

[Tue Aug  5 23:36:39 2008] <alanmun> ill ease your quiz issues bodhi :)

[Tue Aug  5 23:36:41 2008] <bodhi_zazen> 2. I get to know people, and I think that is good

[Tue Aug  5 23:36:45 2008] <alanmun> i think i know your quiz techniques by now :P

[Tue Aug  5 23:36:46 2008] <PrivateVoid> vor... I invited myself...

[Tue Aug  5 23:36:48 2008] <nhandler> +1 vor

[Tue Aug  5 23:36:55 2008] <Rocket2DMn> you miss the personality if you dont do the quizzes here

[Tue Aug  5 23:36:57 2008] <vor> I invited myself too

[Tue Aug  5 23:37:00 2008] <paultag> vor: me too, I came in by my self

[Tue Aug  5 23:37:04 2008] <Druui> me too

[Tue Aug  5 23:37:10 2008] <nhandler> I came by myself too

[Tue Aug  5 23:37:10 2008] <m_newton> i like the INVITING idea

[Tue Aug  5 23:37:14 2008] <paultag> Rocket2DMn: I agree

[Tue Aug  5 23:37:18 2008] <Hellow> i came in myself too

[Tue Aug  5 23:37:30 2008] <m_newton> more ppl wwill know of it that way and will be more happy to join

[Tue Aug  5 23:37:33 2008] <paultag> bodhi_zazen: what about a few people Quizzing

[Tue Aug  5 23:37:36 2008] <Bodsda> inviting yes, but people who just 'turn up' should not be discounted just cause they werent invited

[Tue Aug  5 23:37:38 2008] <Rocket2DMn> m_newton, invitations are great and have proved very successful, but others still find their own way here

[Tue Aug  5 23:37:48 2008] <bodhi_zazen> paultag, that is what we are discussing

[Tue Aug  5 23:37:54 2008] <bodhi_zazen> how many people quiz ?

[Tue Aug  5 23:37:59 2008] <m_newton> Rocket2DMn: y cant we use both ways

[Tue Aug  5 23:38:00 2008] <bodhi_zazen> If more then me, who ?

[Tue Aug  5 23:38:08 2008] <paultag> bodhi_zazen: missed that -- sorry

[Tue Aug  5 23:38:10 2008] <Rocket2DMn> m_newton,  we can and do use both ways

[Tue Aug  5 23:38:12 2008] <Bodsda> i wouldnt mind

[Tue Aug  5 23:38:19 2008] <alanmun> I wouldnt mind helping

[Tue Aug  5 23:38:20 2008] <nhandler> bodhi_zazen: In the past, we have accepted questions from anyone interested. I think we should continue to do that

[Tue Aug  5 23:38:26 2008] <jamesrfla> -1 bodhi_zazen

[Tue Aug  5 23:38:29 2008] <m_newton> bodhi_zazen: how bout the mods?

[Tue Aug  5 23:38:37 2008] <Old_Soldier> I think Rocket2DMn vor and paultag are all good candidates for alternative quizzers

[Tue Aug  5 23:38:42 2008] <bodhi_zazen> too restricted nhandler

[Tue Aug  5 23:38:44 2008] <st33med> Should padawans come to meetings?

[Tue Aug  5 23:38:45 2008] <PrivateVoid> I think the key thing is to schedule the quizzes

[Tue Aug  5 23:38:46 2008] <Rocket2DMn> Old_Soldier, you forgot yourself

[Tue Aug  5 23:38:46 2008] <perlluver> +1 Old_Soldier

[Tue Aug  5 23:38:48 2008] <bodhi_zazen> too restricted m_newton

[Tue Aug  5 23:38:51 2008] <tinivole> bodhi_zazen, you could be the head quizzer, and if anyone else who wishes to add something after your done, they can.

[Tue Aug  5 23:38:52 2008] <paultag> Old_Soldier: thank you ( +1 )

[Tue Aug  5 23:38:58 2008] <Bodsda> st33med, i think so, especially if there up for nomination

[Tue Aug  5 23:39:02 2008] <nhandler> +1 tinivole

[Tue Aug  5 23:39:03 2008] <PrivateVoid> and I think we can have a few people qualified to quiz people...

[Tue Aug  5 23:39:07 2008] <st33med> Well....

[Tue Aug  5 23:39:09 2008] <bodhi_zazen> paultag, is too harsh sommetimes

[Tue Aug  5 23:39:11 2008] <PrivateVoid> but bodhi_zazen should quiz the quizers

[Tue Aug  5 23:39:14 2008] <paultag> hahaha

[Tue Aug  5 23:39:15 2008] <bodhi_zazen> he getts all geeky

[Tue Aug  5 23:39:18 2008] <m_newton> tinivole: i think that is whatr is already happening

[Tue Aug  5 23:39:27 2008] <paultag> bodhi_zazen: heh, if they deal with it then we know they are good ^^

[Tue Aug  5 23:39:30 2008] <tinivole> at least, that is what happened when I got quizzed

[Tue Aug  5 23:39:31 2008] <bodhi_zazen> I am OK with tinivole quizzing too

[Tue Aug  5 23:39:31 2008] <LeAstrale> bodhi_zazen: i like the idea with a weekly scheduled quiz

[Tue Aug  5 23:39:38 2008] <Rocket2DMn> OK, I think the possibility of having others quiz needs to be discussed later, between bodhi_zazen and the potential quizzers.  Can we move on?  We are already 40 minutes into this meeting.

[Tue Aug  5 23:39:45 2008] <bodhi_zazen> +1

[Tue Aug  5 23:39:49 2008] <Old_Soldier> +1

[Tue Aug  5 23:39:50 2008] <st33med> 1++

[Tue Aug  5 23:39:51 2008] <paultag> +1

[Tue Aug  5 23:39:52 2008] <nhandler> +1

[Tue Aug  5 23:39:55 2008] <bodhi_zazen> The big topic ....

[Tue Aug  5 23:39:55 2008] <jamesrfla> +1 Rocket2DMn

[Tue Aug  5 23:39:56 2008] <tinivole> +1

[Tue Aug  5 23:39:58 2008] <Bodsda> Rocket2DMn, why does it matter how long this takes?

[Tue Aug  5 23:39:59 2008] <bodhi_zazen> ambiance ...

[Tue Aug  5 23:40:01 2008] <jamesrfla> -1 bodhi_zazen

[Tue Aug  5 23:40:05 2008] <st33med> AMBIANCE???

[Tue Aug  5 23:40:05 2008] <m_newton> 0

[Tue Aug  5 23:40:12 2008] <tinivole> st33med, ambiance :)

[Tue Aug  5 23:40:16 2008] <Bodsda> st33med, rooms atmosphere

[Tue Aug  5 23:40:16 2008] <m_newton> what r v voting on

[Tue Aug  5 23:40:18 2008] <Rocket2DMn> Bodsda, these meetings tend to drag out, and we put forward the ideas, now we can let them stew

[Tue Aug  5 23:40:18 2008] <st33med> What is tat...

[Tue Aug  5 23:40:19 2008] <Saj0577> Bodsda; Its 00:40 here and work in morning so dont want to be up all night ;)

[Tue Aug  5 23:40:20 2008] <bodhi_zazen> I like that this channel is relaxing, but ...

[Tue Aug  5 23:40:22 2008] <st33med> :P

[Tue Aug  5 23:40:30 2008] <Bodsda> fair enough

[Tue Aug  5 23:40:31 2008] <bodhi_zazen> we need to return to our roots sometimes

[Tue Aug  5 23:40:31 2008] <vor> To clarify what I was saying earlier, if a BT member invites you, they are by default your "master".  If you show up on your own accord, that's excellent but, you should expect to show some sort of meaningful contribution or willingness to help before you can be expected to become a padawan.

[Tue Aug  5 23:40:35 2008] <bodhi_zazen> and this is the time

[Tue Aug  5 23:40:44 2008] <st33med> bodhi_zazen, meditating?>

[Tue Aug  5 23:40:47 2008] <st33med> :)

[Tue Aug  5 23:40:52 2008] <bodhi_zazen> Goals of team :

[Tue Aug  5 23:40:52 2008] <bodhi_zazen> 1. Support new users. Primarily on forums, but also LP and IRC.

[Tue Aug  5 23:40:52 2008] <bodhi_zazen> 2. Deepen involvment with Ubutnu. If you so desire, become involved with LP, wiki, development, etc ...

[Tue Aug  5 23:40:53 2008] <LeAstrale> i can haz master please? :)

[Tue Aug  5 23:40:58 2008] <LeAstrale> xD

[Tue Aug  5 23:41:15 2008] <Hellow> lol LeAstrale

[Tue Aug  5 23:41:15 2008] <bodhi_zazen> So, lets not be excessive on the horseplay

[Tue Aug  5 23:41:17 2008] <alanmun> bodhi, note private message from me..if you want/like idea just talk to me later.

[Tue Aug  5 23:41:18 2008] <paultag> LeAstrale: heh talk to me about the mentor program in a bit

[Tue Aug  5 23:41:31 2008] <st33med> bodhi_zazen, we can still act crazy here, right :D

[Tue Aug  5 23:41:33 2008] <LeAstrale> paultag: catch me on AIM ;)

[Tue Aug  5 23:41:44 2008] <st33med> Bah, dinners ready

[Tue Aug  5 23:41:45 2008] <alanmun> nothing excessive though andrew :)

[Tue Aug  5 23:41:50 2008] <bodhi_zazen> yes, but I am asking everyone to self regulate

[Tue Aug  5 23:42:00 2008] <Rocket2DMn> Guys (and gals), this IRC channel is primarily for the team to stay organized and communicate effectively.  We have ##beginners-help and #ubuntu + IRC Focus Group to help users, including team members if their problems turn out to be more than simple

[Tue Aug  5 23:42:03 2008] <bodhi_zazen> Also I think this channel has grown and needs some moderation

[Tue Aug  5 23:42:15 2008] <paultag> bodhi_zazen: heh, its not 10 of us anymore

[Tue Aug  5 23:42:17 2008] <Bodsda> +1 bodhi_zazen

[Tue Aug  5 23:42:22 2008] <alanmun> +1 paul ;)

[Tue Aug  5 23:42:23 2008] <PrivateVoid> + 1 bodhi_zazen

[Tue Aug  5 23:42:25 2008] <LeAstrale> bodhi_zazen: like what?

[Tue Aug  5 23:42:27 2008] <bodhi_zazen> Please take support to #ubutnu or ##beginners-help

[Tue Aug  5 23:42:28 2008] <m_newton> k+1 bodhi_zazen

[Tue Aug  5 23:42:35 2008] <LeAstrale> +11 bodhi_zazen

[Tue Aug  5 23:42:36 2008] <nhandler> +1 bodhi_zazen

[Tue Aug  5 23:42:40 2008] <Hellow> can i vote?

[Tue Aug  5 23:42:44 2008] <paultag> 0

[Tue Aug  5 23:42:51 2008] <alanmun> 0

[Tue Aug  5 23:42:52 2008] <alanmun> heh

[Tue Aug  5 23:42:52 2008] <bodhi_zazen> this is not a support channel and at times we get too many floods

[Tue Aug  5 23:42:55 2008] <Rocket2DMn> +1 for self moderation -1 for other moderation

[Tue Aug  5 23:42:55 2008] <paultag> <-- I break the rules, so I feel like i can't in good faith say +1

[Tue Aug  5 23:42:58 2008] <bodhi_zazen> also, use !pastebin

[Tue Aug  5 23:43:03 2008] <Bodsda> Hellow, were not doing an official vote, its more an expressio  of our views, so yes

[Tue Aug  5 23:43:09 2008] <Hellow> oh, ok

[Tue Aug  5 23:43:10 2008] <perlluver> +1

[Tue Aug  5 23:43:15 2008] <LeAstrale> paultag: i know you do break them all the time

[Tue Aug  5 23:43:16 2008] <m_newton> ok... who will be the mods of IRC??? will they be half oped

[Tue Aug  5 23:43:20 2008] <Hellow> +1 bodhi_zazen

[Tue Aug  5 23:43:32 2008] <bodhi_zazen> I think I will give admin access to vor, Old_Soldier , Rocket2DMn Joeb454 and overdrank

[Tue Aug  5 23:43:36 2008] <Bodsda> would the irc FG make good irc regulators/mods?

[Tue Aug  5 23:43:39 2008] <Saj0577> Do you not think that the beginners team should maybe have there own irc channel for answering questions as #ubuntu gets hectic.

[Tue Aug  5 23:43:44 2008] <Joeb454> what now?

[Tue Aug  5 23:43:47 2008] <bodhi_zazen> we can all moderate the channel if users can not

[Tue Aug  5 23:43:49 2008] <paultag> Saj0577: ##beginners-help

[Tue Aug  5 23:43:52 2008] <Rocket2DMn> Saj0577, we have that

[Tue Aug  5 23:43:57 2008] <Bodsda> Saj0577, we do ##beginners-help

[Tue Aug  5 23:43:59 2008] <bodhi_zazen> Saj0577, no

[Tue Aug  5 23:44:01 2008] <m_newton> Rocket2DMn: i think we need a few mods .... there are times [tho it shames me to say so[ when i act extreamy dumb

[Tue Aug  5 23:44:05 2008] <bodhi_zazen> use ##beginners-help

[Tue Aug  5 23:44:13 2008] <Joeb454> m_newton, mods in where?

[Tue Aug  5 23:44:14 2008] <Saj0577> okay :)

[Tue Aug  5 23:44:16 2008] <paultag> bodhi_zazen: I support, vor, Old_Soldier, Rocket2DMn, Joeb454 and overdrank

[Tue Aug  5 23:44:19 2008] <m_newton> IRC

[Tue Aug  5 23:44:19 2008] <Bodsda> Joeb454, here

[Tue Aug  5 23:44:19 2008] <bodhi_zazen>  ##beginners-help is for team irc suport, not here

[Tue Aug  5 23:44:27 2008] <Rocket2DMn> alright, mods/ops it is.  seems a necessary evil

[Tue Aug  5 23:44:38 2008] <y_lee> +1 for vor Old_Soldier Rocket2DMn Joeb454 overdrank

[Tue Aug  5 23:44:42 2008] <Bodsda> +1

[Tue Aug  5 23:44:44 2008] <m_newton> +1 Rocket2DMn

[Tue Aug  5 23:44:52 2008] <PrivateVoid> +1

[Tue Aug  5 23:44:55 2008] <nhandler> +1 for mods

[Tue Aug  5 23:44:56 2008] <Hellow> maybe we could develop a bot to automatically moderate the channel?

[Tue Aug  5 23:44:58 2008] <alanmun> 0 dont matter either way for me :)

[Tue Aug  5 23:45:00 2008] <bodhi_zazen> I doubt we will need mods / ops in there, but at least everyone knows who to turn to if I am busy

[Tue Aug  5 23:45:01 2008] <LeAstrale> -1 christianity

[Tue Aug  5 23:45:11 2008] <Joeb454>  /kick LeAstrale

[Tue Aug  5 23:45:11 2008] <m_newton> lets vote on the irc mods bodhi_zazen

[Tue Aug  5 23:45:11 2008] <LeAstrale> ops.. wrong channel ;)

[Tue Aug  5 23:45:13 2008] <nhandler> Hellow: A bot wouldn't be too hard to make. It would need to be oped though

[Tue Aug  5 23:45:24 2008] <Bodsda> m_newton, i dont think we need to

[Tue Aug  5 23:45:24 2008] <vor> I've only every seen 1 person kicked from this channel it was obviously a troll

[Tue Aug  5 23:45:34 2008] <Joeb454> vor, I've seen a few kicked ;)

[Tue Aug  5 23:47:06 2008] <m_newton> ok

[Tue Aug  5 23:47:06 2008] <Rocket2DMn> amen

[Tue Aug  5 23:47:08 2008] <bodhi_zazen> we have discussed this many times

[Tue Aug  5 23:47:10 2008] <alanmun> A MEN

[Tue Aug  5 23:47:17 2008] <bodhi_zazen> the team has agreed to VoteBot

[Tue Aug  5 23:47:19 2008] <nhandler> What about Chanserv, ubot3, and votebot?

[Tue Aug  5 23:47:21 2008] <paultag> m_newton:  <-- thats you

[Tue Aug  5 23:47:25 2008] <Bodsda> lol

[Tue Aug  5 23:47:29 2008] <bodhi_zazen> all other bots -> find a new home

[Tue Aug  5 23:47:29 2008] <Druui> ubot3 is evil

[Tue Aug  5 23:47:36 2008] <jacob> bodhi_zazen: how will you keep LaRoza out?

[Tue Aug  5 23:47:38 2008] <m_newton> bodhi_zazen: can we get a google bot in PLZ?

[Tue Aug  5 23:47:47 2008] <bodhi_zazen> ubot3` can stay as long as he is not abused

[Tue Aug  5 23:47:47 2008] <Rocket2DMn> jacob, well played sir

[Tue Aug  5 23:47:47 2008] <ubot3`> bodhi_zazen: Error: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)

[Tue Aug  5 23:47:48 2008] <paultag> m_newton: meh

[Tue Aug  5 23:47:49 2008] <tinivole> wb raj, your slightly overdue, but not to worry :)

[Tue Aug  5 23:47:50 2008] <alanmun> the regular bots that were here before..can stay..no new bots though :)

[Tue Aug  5 23:47:50 2008] <Bodsda> m_newton, no, its not needed

[Tue Aug  5 23:47:52 2008] <Hellow> ubot3 is actually a very informative and helpful bot at times

[Tue Aug  5 23:47:57 2008] <raj_> :)

[Tue Aug  5 23:48:01 2008] <m_newton> bodhi_zazen: google yahoo... it will do it all

[Tue Aug  5 23:48:08 2008] <tinivole> lol jacob... we have our extreme measures ;)

[Tue Aug  5 23:48:12 2008] <Rocket2DMn> ok /bot discussion, this is old news

[Tue Aug  5 23:48:19 2008] <paultag> yeah it is

[Tue Aug  5 23:48:20 2008] <Joeb454> y_lee, I've seen LaRoza in here once

[Tue Aug  5 23:48:22 2008] <nhandler> +1 Rocket2DMn

[Tue Aug  5 23:48:24 2008] <bodhi_zazen> Rocket2DMn, no there have been issues, lol

[Tue Aug  5 23:48:26 2008] <raj_> +1 y_lee Bring laroza here.

[Tue Aug  5 23:48:30 2008] <Hellow> LaRoza was in here?

[Tue Aug  5 23:48:39 2008] <Rocket2DMn> bodhi_zazen, i know, but we just made it clear again that bots are not welcome, i think we can move on

[Tue Aug  5 23:48:40 2008] <alanmun> yes, very big issues with bots here lately.

[Tue Aug  5 23:48:52 2008] <Bodsda> yes

[Tue Aug  5 23:48:54 2008] <alanmun> we have new users in the room though connor.

[Tue Aug  5 23:48:56 2008] <alanmun> ;)

[Tue Aug  5 23:49:01 2008] <Rocket2DMn> its not really a discussions.  no bots, end of story

[Tue Aug  5 23:49:04 2008] <LeAstrale> LaRoZa = bot

[Tue Aug  5 23:49:05 2008] <bodhi_zazen> That is all I have for the meeting

[Tue Aug  5 23:49:10 2008] <Joeb454> Rocket2DMn, you hardass

[Tue Aug  5 23:49:11 2008] <Joeb454> lol

[Tue Aug  5 23:49:13 2008] <Bodsda> alanmun, can you use irc names plz, so i know who your addressing

[Tue Aug  5 23:49:15 2008] <LeAstrale> j/k

[Tue Aug  5 23:49:16 2008] <bodhi_zazen> any other issues we need to discuss ?

[Tue Aug  5 23:49:20 2008] <Rocket2DMn> yes

[Tue Aug  5 23:49:24 2008] <bodhi_zazen> meetings twice a month ?

[Tue Aug  5 23:49:24 2008] <jamesrfla> That was quick

[Tue Aug  5 23:49:26 2008] <Hellow> did we vote on new members yet?

[Tue Aug  5 23:49:26 2008] <bodhi_zazen> time ?

[Tue Aug  5 23:49:28 2008] <Saj0577> new members?

[Tue Aug  5 23:49:31 2008] <Rocket2DMn> more formal rules for IRC during meetings?

[Tue Aug  5 23:49:36 2008] <raj_> rraj.be

[Tue Aug  5 23:49:36 2008] <nhandler> This time works for me bodhi_zazen

[Tue Aug  5 23:49:37 2008] <Bodsda> bodhi_zazen, please check the agenda on the wiki for my suggestion

[Tue Aug  5 23:49:39 2008] <LeAstrale> Less speak

[Tue Aug  5 23:49:40 2008] <Rocket2DMn> i see a lot of random smiley faces

[Tue Aug  5 23:49:44 2008] <jamesrfla> +1 Rocket2DMn

[Tue Aug  5 23:49:44 2008] <LeAstrale> bodhi_zazen: has the word!

[Tue Aug  5 23:49:47 2008] <alanmun> bodhi_zazen mine too :)

[Tue Aug  5 23:49:48 2008] <PrivateVoid> I would like a more formal approach Rocket2DMn

[Tue Aug  5 23:49:52 2008] <Rocket2DMn> and people welcoming people joining the channel

[Tue Aug  5 23:49:57 2008] <LeAstrale> +1 Rocket2DMn

[Tue Aug  5 23:50:00 2008] <Joeb454> :) :( =/ what Rocket2DMn ? :P

[Tue Aug  5 23:50:01 2008] <Rocket2DMn> fluff that distracts from the discussion at hand

[Tue Aug  5 23:50:03 2008] <PrivateVoid> it is too difficult to follow when there are three conversation threads going on

[Tue Aug  5 23:50:13 2008] <Joeb454> bodhi_zazen, -1 on 2 meetings PCM

[Tue Aug  5 23:50:14 2008] <LeAstrale> +1 PrivateVoid

[Tue Aug  5 23:50:31 2008] <bodhi_zazen> Well, we all have to self regulate

[Tue Aug  5 23:50:34 2008] <LeAstrale> -1 to 2 meetings a month

[Tue Aug  5 23:50:35 2008] <Rocket2DMn> maybe VoteBot should be configured with a Meeting mode, and PM users who join the channel that a meeting is in progress

[Tue Aug  5 23:50:35 2008] <alanmun> ITEM!:We need a better way of identifying tested people/untested/passed etc.

[Tue Aug  5 23:50:42 2008] <paultag> alanmun: voice

[Tue Aug  5 23:50:45 2008] <alanmun> on the wiki

[Tue Aug  5 23:50:46 2008] <bodhi_zazen> I do not want to start dictating behavior as well

[Tue Aug  5 23:50:46 2008] <raj_> +1 for 3 metings

[Tue Aug  5 23:50:53 2008] <raj_> *+1 for 2 meetings

[Tue Aug  5 23:50:55 2008] <m_newton> raj_: no

[Tue Aug  5 23:50:57 2008] <Bodsda> alanmun, we have the hammer and tick on the nomination table

[Tue Aug  5 23:51:00 2008] <alanmun> that little list gets very confusing after a while.

[Tue Aug  5 23:51:04 2008] <LeAstrale> bodhi_zazen: please do while we're having a meeting

[Tue Aug  5 23:51:12 2008] <Saj0577> and people get deleted off it :@

[Tue Aug  5 23:51:17 2008] <alanmun> yes, i do understand that as i am Alan_M and speeddemon8803

[Tue Aug  5 23:51:23 2008] <alanmun> but...for the people that are reading the wiki

[Tue Aug  5 23:51:26 2008] <Rocket2DMn> bodhi_zazen, i understand, but if we lay out a few guidelines for proper etiquitte, we can avoid what is essentially spam during a  meeting

[Tue Aug  5 23:51:28 2008] <alanmun> we need a way for THEM to know as well.

[Tue Aug  5 23:51:30 2008] <tinivole> alanmun, would a simple "red=no" "green=yes" do for you?

[Tue Aug  5 23:51:38 2008] <bodhi_zazen> We can go to a format where only recognized people may speak ?

[Tue Aug  5 23:51:47 2008] <bodhi_zazen> OK

[Tue Aug  5 23:51:48 2008] <Old_Soldier> Rocket2DMn: _1 for etiquette

[Tue Aug  5 23:51:49 2008] <paultag> bodhi_zazen: I think so

[Tue Aug  5 23:51:49 2008] <Rocket2DMn> that might be a little xtreme

[Tue Aug  5 23:51:51 2008] <nhandler> What about making the channel moderated bodhi_zazen ?

[Tue Aug  5 23:51:58 2008] <bodhi_zazen> proper netiquitte ...

[Tue Aug  5 23:52:05 2008] <Old_Soldier> +1 rather :/

[Tue Aug  5 23:52:06 2008] <paultag> Rocket2DMn: no way, I would like mtns to be moderated

[Tue Aug  5 23:52:11 2008] <nhandler> You could then temporarily voice padawans and other users who need to participate

[Tue Aug  5 23:52:12 2008] <jacob> +m means you won't get random blurbs from jacob :P

[Tue Aug  5 23:52:14 2008] <bodhi_zazen> keep comments on topic

[Tue Aug  5 23:52:25 2008] <bodhi_zazen> bring off topic conversations elsewhere

[Tue Aug  5 23:52:26 2008] <LeAstrale> bodhi_zazen: id suggest you state when people are allowed to break the silence and comment on topic

[Tue Aug  5 23:52:39 2008] <paultag> LeAstrale++;

[Tue Aug  5 23:52:39 2008] <m_newton> +1 LeAstrale

[Tue Aug  5 23:52:42 2008] <PrivateVoid> not sure how to do it right... I like people being able to speak, but it is the off-topic stuff that causes issues

[Tue Aug  5 23:52:49 2008] <PrivateVoid> not people talking on topic

[Tue Aug  5 23:53:02 2008] <bodhi_zazen> people may speak freely, but on topic

[Tue Aug  5 23:53:08 2008] <vor> The meetings constitute less than 0.1% of the channel time.  If someone isn't on topic (or making a clever quip), silence them.

[Tue Aug  5 23:53:11 2008] <ApOgEE-> Greetings All

[Tue Aug  5 23:53:13 2008] <Alan_Away> im out..bye..hope the meeting works out :D

[Tue Aug  5 23:53:19 2008] <Rocket2DMn> OK, well the idea has been thrown out there.  Let's see how self-moderation works out over the next weeks during regular time in the channel.  If we need to work up a proposal for proper netiquette, we can do that later

[Tue Aug  5 23:53:23 2008] <bodhi_zazen> you can all help if there is off topic chatter, I can not address it all myself

[Tue Aug  5 23:53:24 2008] <nhandler> What about removing everyones' voice (except bodhi's) for the meeting. Bodhi can then make the channel moderated while he is introducing a topic, and then remove the moderation when he opens it up for discussion

[Tue Aug  5 23:53:36 2008] <paultag> nhandler: that is a lot of work

[Tue Aug  5 23:53:47 2008] <raj_> +1 nhandler

[Tue Aug  5 23:53:48 2008] <paultag> lets try self moderation

[Tue Aug  5 23:53:53 2008] <paultag> +1 Rocket2DMn

[Tue Aug  5 23:53:53 2008] <Bodsda> nhandler, you could make votebot do that

[Tue Aug  5 23:54:00 2008] <Hellow> -1 nhandler, that is alot of work

[Tue Aug  5 23:54:00 2008] <jamesrfla> +1 nhandler

[Tue Aug  5 23:54:01 2008] <PrivateVoid> if you do that you might as well have a #ubuntuforums-beginners-meeting channel

[Tue Aug  5 23:54:01 2008] <bodhi_zazen> someone else would need to op

[Tue Aug  5 23:54:06 2008] <nhandler> Not currently Bodsda. It isn't oped

[Tue Aug  5 23:54:07 2008] <Joeb454> self_moderation how?

[Tue Aug  5 23:54:08 2008] <m_newton> bodhi_zazen: I like the idea.... BUT wont sussh ppl just add to the noise?

[Tue Aug  5 23:54:16 2008] <bodhi_zazen> send a pm

[Tue Aug  5 23:54:20 2008] <m_newton> kk

[Tue Aug  5 23:54:23 2008] <Rocket2DMn> i think manually moderating the channel during meetings is extreme, lets start with self moderation, then outline rules if necessary

[Tue Aug  5 23:54:29 2008] <bodhi_zazen>  /msg m_newton shh, meeting

[Tue Aug  5 23:54:34 2008] <Bodsda> nhandler, no, but bodhi could op the bot then do the command then un op, two commands not 10-15 for individual voiced members

[Tue Aug  5 23:54:34 2008] <PrivateVoid> we could also use O/ as a I want to speak

[Tue Aug  5 23:54:34 2008] <Old_Soldier> Roberts was developed for a reason, but hopefully self moderation is really a better choice

[Tue Aug  5 23:54:36 2008] <bodhi_zazen>  /msg m_newton stay on topic

[Tue Aug  5 23:54:38 2008] <Rocket2DMn> this IS a team effort

[Tue Aug  5 23:54:38 2008] <LeAstrale> vor: i second that

[Tue Aug  5 23:54:45 2008] <m_newton> kk

[Tue Aug  5 23:55:17 2008] <bodhi_zazen> OK, next topic

[Tue Aug  5 23:55:20 2008] <bodhi_zazen> New members

[Tue Aug  5 23:55:28 2008] <jamesrfla> Finnaly

[Tue Aug  5 23:55:29 2008] <vor> Rocket2DMn: I agree.  An hour a month isn't important enough to get all medieval.  Be on topic (or clever) or be silenced.  Listo.

[Tue Aug  5 23:55:32 2008] <bodhi_zazen> lol

[Tue Aug  5 23:55:35 2008] <Hellow> yay

[Tue Aug  5 23:55:41 2008] <Druui> heh

[Tue Aug  5 23:55:44 2008] <m_newton> ok

[Tue Aug  5 23:55:44 2008] <raj_> :)

[Tue Aug  5 23:55:50 2008] <jamesrfla> :(

[Tue Aug  5 23:55:54 2008] <ApOgEE-> :D

[Tue Aug  5 23:55:58 2008] <bodhi_zazen> hmm, may need to moderate the channel

[Tue Aug  5 23:56:17 2008] <bodhi_zazen> who do we feel should be added to our membersip ?

[Tue Aug  5 23:56:23 2008] <m_newton>  /msg channel NO smiles during meeting?

[Tue Aug  5 23:56:27 2008] <Bodsda> bodhi_zazen, check ur pm from me

[Tue Aug  5 23:56:27 2008] <Druui> i do.

[Tue Aug  5 23:56:32 2008] <bodhi_zazen> and cool

[Tue Aug  5 23:56:39 2008] <nhandler> Well, if the quiz is a requirement, not many padawans are eligable

[Tue Aug  5 23:56:39 2008] <bodhi_zazen> Anyone else ?

[Tue Aug  5 23:56:40 2008] <Rocket2DMn> lets just go down the list and do private votes

[Tue Aug  5 23:56:41 2008] <ApOgEE-> ok m_newton

[Tue Aug  5 23:56:58 2008] <jamesrfla> you know where I am at bodhi_zazen

[Tue Aug  5 23:56:58 2008] <PrivateVoid> I can neither support BLT nor be against as I have not met him/her

[Tue Aug  5 23:56:59 2008] <Rocket2DMn> I think BLT is a hilarious guy, hes old school Ubuntu too

[Tue Aug  5 23:57:07 2008] <Joeb454> true

[Tue Aug  5 23:57:11 2008] <st33med> How old school?

[Tue Aug  5 23:57:13 2008] <m_newton> we wont Saj0577

[Tue Aug  5 23:57:15 2008] <Bodsda> ive never seen/heard BLT

[Wed Aug  6 00:08:24 2008] <Old_Soldier> somehow Saj0577 was dropped from the agenda.

[Wed Aug  6 00:08:27 2008] <st33med> Joeb454, you are alone and in the dark. You are likely to be eaten by a grue

[Wed Aug  6 00:08:32 2008] <bodhi_zazen> OK lets go back to membership

[Wed Aug  6 00:08:34 2008] <st33med> ;)

[Wed Aug  6 00:09:32 2008] <bodhi_zazen> the channel has gotten busy, but it is sometimes distracting

[Wed Aug  6 00:10:39 2008] <rraj> nhandler

[Wed Aug  6 00:10:48 2008] <PrivateVoid> rrach was given nhandler

[Wed Aug  6 00:10:50 2008] <rraj> nhandler is my master bodhi

[Wed Aug  6 00:10:53 2008] <PrivateVoid> rraj I mean sorry

[Wed Aug  6 00:10:57 2008] <Alan_M> ATTENTION: When bodhi is talking..everyone..quiet...can we all handle this?

[Wed Aug  6 00:10:58 2008] <Rocket2DMn> can everybody please calm down

[Wed Aug  6 00:11:02 2008] <rraj> np

[Wed Aug  6 00:11:06 2008] <PrivateVoid> or at least that is what is on the page

[Wed Aug  6 00:11:18 2008] <DrSmall> i must be the only one listening...

[Wed Aug  6 00:11:37 2008] <rraj> i am too there dr small

[Wed Aug  6 00:11:39 2008] <Alan_M> im listening :)

[Wed Aug  6 00:11:43 2008] <Alan_M> trying to

[Wed Aug  6 00:11:59 2008] <bodhi_zazen> OK, lest re-discuss the process of membership then

[Wed Aug  6 00:12:02 2008] <Saj0577> what was said since i last spoke anything towards me i crashed?

[Wed Aug  6 00:12:10 2008] <Bodsda> bodhi_zazen, can i suggest a new column on the member nomination table on the wiki. I know members of this team dont have to be on irc, but i for one have only seen two or three people on that list here. I suggest a column for people agreeing to that nomination

[Wed Aug  6 00:12:29 2008] <bodhi_zazen> I think new members should formally request a master on the wiki page

[Wed Aug  6 00:12:39 2008] <Saj0577> bodhi_zazen whats happening with me?

[Wed Aug  6 00:12:41 2008] <m_newton> + 1 bodhi_zazen

[Wed Aug  6 00:12:46 2008] <Alan_M> +1

[Wed Aug  6 00:12:47 2008] <m_newton> brb

[Wed Aug  6 00:12:49 2008] <bodhi_zazen> Saj0577, I don't know yet

[Wed Aug  6 00:12:52 2008] <DrSmall> +3

[Wed Aug  6 00:12:56 2008] <Hellow> +1 bodhi_zazen, i didnt know who my master was for a while

[Wed Aug  6 00:12:57 2008] <paultag> bodhi_zazen: hold on -- should the Edu team set this up, we are doing the same thing, why reinvent the wheel

[Wed Aug  6 00:12:58 2008] <Bodsda> bodhi_zazen, yes, but i think more then one person should agree before they are quizzed/voted on

[Wed Aug  6 00:13:05 2008] <jamesrfla> ?

[Wed Aug  6 00:13:07 2008] <bodhi_zazen> lets get the whole membership thing back on track ...

[Wed Aug  6 00:13:26 2008] <Joeb454> +10

[Wed Aug  6 00:13:26 2008] <ApOgEE-> bodhi_zazen, can they request a master here?

[Wed Aug  6 00:13:27 2008] <bodhi_zazen> OK, add names in with a date

[Wed Aug  6 00:13:40 2008] <Alan_M> paul, reinventing the wheel is FUN though! :D (just kidding)

[Wed Aug  6 00:13:44 2008] <PrivateVoid> O/

[Wed Aug  6 00:13:46 2008] <bodhi_zazen>  name, date

[Wed Aug  6 00:13:56 2008] <Joeb454> bodhi_zazen, if visited IRC?

[Wed Aug  6 00:14:01 2008] <bodhi_zazen> if no one has connected within one week , let me know ?

[Wed Aug  6 00:14:03 2008] <Alan_M> +1 joe

[Wed Aug  6 00:14:07 2008] <Druui> which wiki page to request for a master?

[Wed Aug  6 00:14:10 2008] <bodhi_zazen> go PrivateVoid

[Wed Aug  6 00:14:16 2008] <rraj> wher is my master nhandler. .

[Wed Aug  6 00:14:22 2008] <Bodsda> bodhi_zazen, the two people we voted on havent connected in a week

[Wed Aug  6 00:14:25 2008] <PrivateVoid> Bodhi -- the padawans I had asked in here...

[Wed Aug  6 00:14:35 2008] <Old_Soldier> bodsa THATS NOT TRUE

[Wed Aug  6 00:14:36 2008] <nhandler> Bodsda: Coolbhavi was here earlier today

[Wed Aug  6 00:14:36 2008] <bodhi_zazen> yes

[Wed Aug  6 00:14:36 2008] <PrivateVoid> and I walked them through the process of adding their names to the IRC page

[Wed Aug  6 00:14:41 2008] <Bodsda> really?

[Wed Aug  6 00:14:42 2008] <rraj> :)

[Wed Aug  6 00:14:45 2008] <PrivateVoid> and walked them through getting their wiki pages

[Wed Aug  6 00:14:47 2008] <Bodsda> BLT -- ive never seen him

[Wed Aug  6 00:14:54 2008] <Old_Soldier> sorry caps lock lol

[Wed Aug  6 00:14:57 2008] <PrivateVoid> and in the case of all but two they have become members

[Wed Aug  6 00:14:59 2008] <Hellow> BLT was one just a few days ago

[Wed Aug  6 00:15:02 2008] <bodhi_zazen> Bodsda, stay on topic please

[Wed Aug  6 00:15:04 2008] <m_newton> back

[Wed Aug  6 00:15:10 2008] <PrivateVoid> I think new members will need the guidance

[Wed Aug  6 00:15:12 2008] <Bodsda> bodhi_zazen, i am

[Wed Aug  6 00:15:22 2008] <ApOgEE-> +1 PrivateVoid

[Wed Aug  6 00:15:32 2008] <PrivateVoid> and asking in here should be allowed, but for group consideration they need to edit the wiki page for meetings

[Wed Aug  6 00:15:34 2008] <PrivateVoid> at the very least

[Wed Aug  6 00:15:34 2008] <bodhi_zazen> BLT and cool are well know , lol

[Wed Aug  6 00:15:36 2008] <m_newton> bodhi_zazen: did we vote on the formal acceptance for the master/

[Wed Aug  6 00:15:53 2008] <PrivateVoid> that also will give the potential master an idea of how they follow instructions, how patient they are, etc

[Wed Aug  6 00:16:14 2008] <Saj0577> bodhi_zazen So i have to wait till next meeting?

[Wed Aug  6 00:16:14 2008] <bodhi_zazen> +1 PrivateVoid

[Wed Aug  6 00:16:20 2008] <Rocket2DMn> I think we should stop this discussion, we are not making any progress.  We have already talked about what the problems are, and now we need some time to think about it

[Wed Aug  6 00:16:21 2008] <bodhi_zazen> I think that is the way to go

[Wed Aug  6 00:16:27 2008] <PrivateVoid> Saj0577, I can assist you after the meeting

[Wed Aug  6 00:16:31 2008] <rraj> so i have to wait for next meeting?

[Wed Aug  6 00:16:36 2008] <Hellow> +1 Rocket2DMn

[Wed Aug  6 00:16:42 2008] <m_newton> PrivateVoid: Are the going to have to know how to do that or are they gonnay be taught and if so by who and when

[Wed Aug  6 00:16:43 2008] <Rocket2DMn> I think bodhi_zazen needs to make some tough decisions in the near future regarding recruiting on this team, and he has had our input and much to consider

[Wed Aug  6 00:16:53 2008] <bodhi_zazen> Saj0577 and rraj you are both welcome to the team, I think we got off track

[Wed Aug  6 00:16:56 2008] <PrivateVoid> m_newton, taught -- just like I taught you.

[Wed Aug  6 00:17:01 2008] <m_newton> ok

[Wed Aug  6 00:17:07 2008] <Saj0577> bodhi_zazen so im in or not?

[Wed Aug  6 00:17:09 2008] <rraj> then could you start voting :)

[Wed Aug  6 00:17:30 2008] <m_newton> i think Saj0577 should be in...

[Wed Aug  6 00:17:36 2008] <DrSmall> i missed alot of the meeting, so I am just listening right now.

[Wed Aug  6 00:17:40 2008] <paultag> m_newton: we cant vote without the team

[Wed Aug  6 00:17:42 2008] <ApOgEE-> I suggest should use #ubuntu-classroom session and put the log on wiki

[Wed Aug  6 00:17:53 2008] <DrSmall> paultag, the team is here

[Wed Aug  6 00:17:55 2008] <Old_Soldier> bodhi. i dont recall if saj was quizzed but I will sponsor him if he has een quizzed

[Wed Aug  6 00:21:34 2008] <overdrank> +1 Rocket2DMn

[Wed Aug  6 00:21:36 2008] <PrivateVoid> m_newton, we have in a past meeting

[Wed Aug  6 00:21:40 2008] <m_newton> oh...

[Wed Aug  6 00:21:41 2008] <PrivateVoid> but I think that is back on the table

[Wed Aug  6 00:21:46 2008] <y_lee> welcome louieb and i suppose the meeting is over

[Wed Aug  6 00:21:48 2008] <jamesrfla> -1 bodhi_zazen

[Wed Aug  6 00:21:52 2008] <Bodsda> did we decide on a criteria for new members nomination?

[Wed Aug  6 00:21:58 2008] <Rocket2DMn> no

[Wed Aug  6 00:22:04 2008] <Rocket2DMn> it is a work in progress

[Wed Aug  6 00:22:10 2008] <bodhi_zazen> no, we are discussing recruitment at the moment

[Wed Aug  6 00:22:21 2008] <PrivateVoid> we decided to discuss it more... and that it needs work

[Wed Aug  6 00:22:27 2008] <Bodsda> can we discuss new member nomination criteria now then?

[Wed Aug  6 00:22:29 2008] <PrivateVoid> tis part of the growing pains

[Wed Aug  6 00:22:32 2008] <bodhi_zazen> do we need anything more formal ?

[Wed Aug  6 00:22:35 2008] <louieb> hi y_lee  is it over? lol just my luck

[Wed Aug  6 00:22:37 2008] <Bodsda> i think so

[Wed Aug  6 00:22:44 2008] <PrivateVoid> nothing more formal from me bodhi_zazen

[Wed Aug  6 00:22:47 2008] <Hellow> i believe it is

[Wed Aug  6 00:22:54 2008] <Joeb454> nothing more from me

[Wed Aug  6 00:23:00 2008] <Rocket2DMn> no, i think criteria for recruiting and master/padawan needs to be thought over for awhile, let's not work on deciding anything today

[Wed Aug  6 00:23:00 2008] <bodhi_zazen> I like the plan PrivateVoid laid out

[Wed Aug  6 00:23:06 2008] <Joeb454> though if anybody is interested re: focus group, let me know in ##beginners-help

[Wed Aug  6 00:23:06 2008] <tinivole> bodhi_zazen, something more definitive, perhaps... formal, no.

[Wed Aug  6 00:23:20 2008] <Bodsda> Joeb454, what FG?

[Wed Aug  6 00:23:30 2008] <Joeb454> good point

[Wed Aug  6 00:23:34 2008] <Joeb454> IRC

[Wed Aug  6 00:23:44 2008] <nhandler> If that is everything, could we officially end the meeting?

[Wed Aug  6 00:23:46 2008] <Bodsda> im there

[Wed Aug  6 00:24:02 2008] <bodhi_zazen> I think people who are interested should add themselves to the wiki page with a date and it is up to them to establish a mentor

[Wed Aug  6 00:24:06 2008] <Rocket2DMn> +1 for ending the meetings, its been 1 1/2 ours

[Wed Aug  6 00:24:15 2008] <Hellow> +1 for ending the meeting

[Wed Aug  6 00:24:18 2008] <bodhi_zazen> Rocket2DMn, meeting is over
