A FAQ about Brainstorm and its behavior.

=== Custom installation of Brainstorm ===
''When I post an idea, it does not appear on the front page. But it does appear on the latest ideas!!''

The front page only show ideas than are older than one hour and no older than one day, ordered by popularity. You will just have to wait :)

''When I post an idea, it does not appear on the "most popular this week/month" page. But it does appear on the latest ideas!!''

These pages does not show ideas not older than one day, so you will have to wait one day :)

''There a a lot of Ubuntu-specific stuff I want to get rid of! How do I do it?''

Either you can wait for us while we are working on making Brainstorm project-neutral, or you can just start to hack away the code. Some advices can be found on IRC (#ubuntu-brainstorm at irc.freenode.net).
