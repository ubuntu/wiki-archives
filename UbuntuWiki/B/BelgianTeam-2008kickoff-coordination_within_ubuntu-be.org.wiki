=== Discussion ===
* internal structure of ubuntu-be 
** list of different main tasks, one/or two responsible for task. => already exists
    -> Difficult to delegate responsibilities, because it is not easy to know exact someones reliability
 
 
* main communication channels ? 
** meetings on IRC
** meetings IRL (in real life)
*** proposal to do it on the 3 months. Every time a 'strong' agenda. Has advantage to make more results, implicate the people more in the project. People can work during the meeting. (morning meeting, afternoon work)
** system of date-picking
* definitions of concrete plans and deadlines to 'get the work done'.
** need a kind of coordination of tasks/ project management
** not use something to formal
** assign tickets/tasks to a person
** should remind people to work on it
** more visible what everyone did. Kind of reward                 
** Chri thinks about a bugtracker as taskslist
** François proposes Trac: has ticketing system, AND fileupload...
** See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_project_management_software for a list of PM software
** openID integration is a good extra,
** launchpad has a feature to use it for LoCoTeam !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
**** But public (= need alternative for file/data sharing) and not localized (not really a problem)
**** alternative for file sharing: possibly http://www.springnote.com/en ?
   
** Conclusion: launchpad ticketing system + ??file-sharing system for privacy?? 
** FrancoisCauwe will find in one month a solution ! TODO pffff

* Private place to publish things like
** list of press contacts
** private emails/names of visitors of fairs
