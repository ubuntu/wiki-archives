__TOC__


The <nowiki>[[http://bugzilla.mozilla.org|Mozilla Bugzilla]]</nowiki> is used for Mozilla projects such as Firefox and Thunderbird.

== Using the bug tracker ==

Mozilla Bugs are tracked upstream at '''<nowiki>[[http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/|bugzilla.mozilla.org]]</nowiki>'''. Click 'New Account' in the top right corner and enter your email address, a confirmation email is going to be send to you.

=== Searching ===

The advanced search page allows you to search the mozilla bug database in a quite sophisticated fashion. At <nowiki>[[https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/query.cgi?format=advanced|Advanced Search]]</nowiki> page you can search by:

* Bug Numbers
* Phrases
* Status
* Priority
* Target
* Keywords
* etc ...

The Mozilla bug database has quite a large number of bugs; so always constraint your search to the proper mozilla product and component. If you don't find your bug on the first try, consider to search in a separate component. If you still cannot find your bug, remember to also search through already resolved bugs as the issue you are seeing might already be fixed in the current development tree.

=== Filing new bugs ===

For forwarding bugs to the <nowiki>[[http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/|Mozilla Bugtracker]]</nowiki> you should follow these steps:
 
* <nowiki>[[https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/page.cgi?id=quicksearchhack.html&GoAheadAndLogIn=1|Login]]</nowiki> or create a <nowiki>[[https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/createaccount.cgi|New Account]]</nowiki>
* Check if the bug is already reported with the <nowiki>[[https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/query.cgi?format=advanced|Advanced Search|advanced search tool]]</nowiki>
* ''If it doesn't already exist'' try to search a differnt component; its not always obvious where to find a specific bugs, so playing around often shows up bugs you previously couldnt find. If you finally still haven't found a matching bug, open a <nowiki>[[https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi|new bug]]</nowiki>

'''Before submitting a new bug, you need to take care of a few things:'''
* Please read the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MozillaTeam/Bugs/TriagersHandbook|Mozilla Team Triagers Handbook]]</nowiki> and make sure that all the information requested is on the report.
* Choose the right component: A page like this one is going to be presented to you, you just need to click in the right product: example firefox.
 <nowiki>[[File:enter_bug1.png]]</nowiki>

==== Step 1 ====
 <nowiki>[[File:enter_bugstep1.png]]</nowiki>
* A list with the <nowiki>[[https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/duplicates.cgi?product=SeaMonkey&product=Firefox&format=simple|most duplicated bugs]]</nowiki> is going to be shown, please have a look to that list and make sure your bug is not there.

==== Step 2 ====
  
 <nowiki>[[File:enter_bugstep2.png]]</nowiki>
 
* Give the information about the report: 
** For products like firefox you need to choose the right component which is affected by your bug, for example Bookmarks & History, for a whole list of components please have a look to <nowiki>[[https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describecomponents.cgi?product=Firefox|Components in Firefox]]</nowiki>.
** A Good Summary needs to be given and it should summarises the problem. Please be descriptive and use lots of keywords: examples: 
*** Bad example: mail crashed
*** Good example: crash if I close the mail window while checking for new POP mail 
** Details, you need to expand on the Summary and be as specific as possible about what is wrong.
*** Bad example: Mozilla crashed.
*** Good example: After a crash which happened when I was sorting in the Bookmark Manager, all of my top-level bookmark folders beginning with the letters Q to Z are no longer present. 
** Select the reproducibility, if it happens every time, sometimes, you couldn't reproduce it, etc.
** Give detailed steps on how to reproduce the issue.
** Actual results, what's happened with the application after that you performed the steps given above. 
** Expected results, what should the application do with the performed steps above.
** Select Severity, If the bug is a crash report make sure to select Critical or if it's a feature request choose Enhancement, etc.
* Provide a complete description and a link to our bug in Launchpad.

==== Step 3 ====

After this just submit the bug clicking on '''Submit Bug Report''' and follow the steps listed <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bugs/Watches|here]]</nowiki> for linking the report to Launchpad.

'''Example:''' TBD

=== Keywords and conventions ===

For the list of keywords please take a look to the <nowiki>[[https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi|Mozilla Keywords description]]</nowiki>.

=== Launchpad Bug Watch ===

After you have forwarded the bug to Mozilla's bugzilla you will want to create a "Bug Watch" in Launchpad that links the Ubuntu bug to the Mozilla bug.  This bug watch will be updated regularly and reflect the status of the upstream bug report.  Details on creating one are found at <nowiki>[[Bugs-Watches]]</nowiki>.

=== Other Notes; best practices ===

To ensure your bug gets upstream attention its important to file your complete bug against the right product/component. If you are unsure which one to use, please ask the ubuntu mozillateam.

Also, its important to get your bug into a confirmed state. If you don't have the "canconfirm" permission in bugzilla yet, ask the ubuntu mozillateam to confirm a bug for you.

Last but not least: Please be responsive and follow up to upstream questions.
