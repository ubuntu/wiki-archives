=== Who am I ===
Working as a web developer and server administrator. Geek. Interested in a lot of things around Linux, Debian and Ubuntu.

I've been working with Ubuntu on a daily basis since just after Hoary came out. It's running both my PC at home and at work, as well as some servers I co-manage.
