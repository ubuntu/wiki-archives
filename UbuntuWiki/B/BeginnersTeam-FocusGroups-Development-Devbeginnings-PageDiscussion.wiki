== Discussion ==

=== Create this Discussion Page ===
* Created this page to discuss <nowiki>[[BeginnersTeam-FocusGroups-Development-Devbeginnings|Devbeginnings]]</nowiki>  -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:lantzr]]</nowiki>   
=== Setup pbuilder - Issue ===
* <nowiki>[[BeginnersTeam-FocusGroups-Development-Devbeginnings#Set_up_pbuilder|Setup pbuilder]]</nowiki> directs changing ~/.pbuilderrc
** While confusing it is less an issue than I first thought -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:lantzr]]</nowiki>   * sudo pbuilder
** sudo will run pbuilder as root 
** /etc/pbuilderrb ponts to ../pbuilderrb
*** /pbuilderrc not installed
** Will read ~/.pbuilderrc if it exists

=== Possible Corrections ===
* Change ~/.pbuilderrc
** should really add config file to /etc/pbuilderrc
* Change /etc/pbuilderrc
** Note weird symlink to root
** /etc/pbuilderrc links to ../pbuilderrc
* Change /pbuilderrc
* Change /root/.pbuilder
* Change pbuilder to not require root
