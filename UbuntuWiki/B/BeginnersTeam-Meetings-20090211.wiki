[00:04:40] <VoteBot> =-=-=Meeting mode enabled=-=-=

[00:04:41] <Rocket2DMn> fail

[00:05:13] <bodhi_zazen> I would like to change the format a little

[00:05:25] <nhandler> In what way bodhi_zazen ?

[00:05:36] <bodhi_zazen> Do any of the focus groups have anything major to report ?

[00:05:42] <nhandler> Nope

[00:05:48] <Rocket2DMn> nope

[00:05:50] <Bodsda> bodhi_zazen, yes

[00:05:56] <bodhi_zazen> go Bodsda

[00:06:34] <Bodsda> bodhi_zazen, Dev FG has the unfortunate news of our beloved leader (paultag) leaving for "a month or so to sort some shit out"

[00:06:56] <ibuclaw> beloved?

[00:06:58] <bodhi_zazen> :(

[00:07:02] <Rocket2DMn> that's news to me

[00:07:08] <Bodsda> ibuclaw, hated?

[00:07:09] <nhandler> Me too

[00:07:13] <bodhi_zazen> has anyone taken his place ?

[00:07:17] <bodhi_zazen> in the interim ?

[00:07:22] <nhandler> I believe that is on the agenda

[00:07:23] <Bodsda> bodhi_zazen, he elected drubin

[00:07:29] <ibuclaw> bodhi_zazen, I believe me and drubin will manage for the time being

[00:07:30 * jamesrfla isn't in a focus group :(

[00:07:44] <bodhi_zazen> is that OK with drubin and the rest of the team ?

[00:07:53] <ibuclaw> I exchange a few words with drubin the other day

[00:07:55 * easwar wonders where is elfy?

[00:07:57] <Bodsda> bodhi_zazen, i have no problems, ibuclaw is around more though

[00:08:00] <PartyBoi2> I have no probs with that

[00:08:02] <nhandler> Is this only until paultag gets back?

[00:08:08] <bodhi_zazen> OK ibuclaw , can we update the Dev wiki page, thanks

[00:08:10] <Bodsda> nhandler, i believe so

[00:08:13] <ajmorris> yes nhandler

[00:08:17] <bodhi_zazen> I think so nhandler , but ...

[00:08:19] <ajmorris> he appointed him just before he left...

[00:08:24] <nhandler> We should also update the team on LP

[00:08:27] <bodhi_zazen> that brings up my agenda items :)

[00:08:48] <ajmorris> just on IRC; not really anything from IRC :P, other than we're getting more people stopping by now these days, and with more people sitting in the channel, most have them have gone away happy :D -- Would be nice if members brought more people from #ubuntu in aswell though....

[00:08:52] <bodhi_zazen> I want to discuss leadersip / team goals / personal goals

[00:09:15] <jamesrfla> I can't stand #ubuntu

[00:09:25 * easwar neither

[00:09:35] <bodhi_zazen> First a *brief* review of the team and our purpose ...

[00:09:45] <ajmorris> thats the point of ##beginners-help ;)

[00:09:53] <bodhi_zazen> Our purpose / focus is the ubuntu forums

[00:09:53] <Bodsda> ajmorris, problem is not many of us are in #ubuntu regularly

[00:09:53] <jamesrfla> +1 ajmorris

[00:10:11] <bodhi_zazen> and to help new users transition to Ubuntu

[00:10:21] <ajmorris> you could stop in from time to time Bodsda?

[00:10:36] <bodhi_zazen> I have taken it as a broad agenda and i would like to support the broader Ubuntu community as well

[00:10:46] <bodhi_zazen> I like a mix of new and experienced users

[00:11:03] <nhandler> I think we are already doing a bit of that with the FGs bodhi_zazen

[00:11:12] <Bodsda> ajmorris, im always there :)

[00:11:18] <bodhi_zazen> as well as some representation on additional areas such as wiki, LP, IRC, etc

[00:11:33] <ajmorris> lol Bodsda, i meant #ubuntu :P

[00:11:39] <bodhi_zazen> Which brings up leadership ...

[00:11:44] <Bodsda> ajmorris, so did i

[00:12:03] <bodhi_zazen> The team has grown and IMO this is awesome

[00:12:12] <jamesrfla> IMO?

[00:12:13] <Rocket2DMn> it is awesome

[00:12:18] <bodhi_zazen> we have matured, but I would hope we still continue to grow

[00:12:45] <Bodsda> jamesrfla, in my opinion

[00:12:52] <bodhi_zazen> so to support growth we need the focus groups and the FG leaders to assist as one person can not manage all the growth and contributions

[00:13:01] <jamesrfla> thanks Bodsda

[00:13:06] <Bodsda> no probs :)

[00:13:30] <Rocket2DMn> bodhi_zazen, what did you have in mind for FG leads outside of their current organization of their FGs?

[00:13:34] <bodhi_zazen> Some people have expressed a concern that the team is faltering or that it does not do enough

[00:13:47] <nhandler> bodhi_zazen: When you are done, I have something I want to bring up re: LP FG

[00:13:51] <Bodsda> bodhi_zazen, faltering on what area?

[00:14:07] <bodhi_zazen> Bods, it was a broad suggestion

[00:14:25] <bodhi_zazen> So I would like to ask the team for feedback / impressions

[00:14:29] <easwar> and I have something regarding voting on padawans

[00:14:35] <jamesrfla> I can devote more time to the forums after I get my computer fixed

[00:14:44] <Rocket2DMn> bodhi_zazen, I would like to see FG leaders help to integrate their FGs closer with other Ubuntu teams

[00:14:45] <bodhi_zazen> and if anyone needs guidance on what to do ask either myself or the FG leaders

[00:14:58] <jamesrfla> I have backups but I want to get it working again

[00:15:15] <Bodsda> bodhi_zazen, i believe we need more structure in the focus groups and in this channel

[00:15:31] <bodhi_zazen> If you need something "to do" and are not interested in a FG => brouse the forums, advertise the team, recruit

[00:15:40] <Rocket2DMn> For example, I encourage Wiki FG members to join the ubuntu-doc and wiki teams. I think LP users should strive for bugcontrol or other teams that support LP's funcitons

[00:15:51] <nhandler> I personally am looking for a co-leader for the LP FG. I have some good ideas, but I need some help (especially with getting a few meetings going)

[00:15:52] <bodhi_zazen> +1 Rocket2DMn

[00:16:05] <ajmorris> re: faltering and does not do enough... I agree that we could be involved more, we have the FGs, but they are not all that active, although, whoever brought this to your attention, also has to remember we are all volunteers

[00:16:08] <bodhi_zazen> BUT it is not a requirement to be involved in a FG

[00:16:39] <bodhi_zazen> So I would also like to ask, do we need to change/ re-elect FG leads ?

[00:16:40] <Rocket2DMn> I know there were a few people in here intersted in bugs, they should join the LP FG

[00:16:42] <Bodsda> nhandler, im not a fan of LP but i am looking for something to do, if i could learn how to use it i would be happy to help

[00:16:42] <easwar> ajmorris, +1

[00:16:43] <bodhi_zazen> and if so which ones ?

[00:16:55] <nhandler> Bodsda: I have no issue helping to teach

[00:17:00] <Bodsda> cool :)

[00:17:13] <nhandler> Bodsda: I just would like a co-leader to help "force" me to hold meetings and things like that ;)

[00:17:25] <easwar> nhandler, cron?

[00:17:26] <Bodsda> nhandler, oh, i can do that :)

[00:17:28] <bodhi_zazen> nhandler: +1

[00:17:30 * jamesrfla sticks to UF and IRC and mayeb wiki

[00:17:57] <bodhi_zazen> If the curent FG leads are adequate, lets get some FG meetings going ;)

[00:17:57] <Bodsda> jamesrfla, maybe consider getting to know some of the guys in #ubuntu -- the channel is quite friendly after you get to grips with the speed

[00:18:09] <bodhi_zazen> even if it startes as 1 or 2 people

[00:18:09] <Bodsda> bodhi_zazen, I agree, there is not enough meetings

[00:18:15 * nhandler notes that we could use the LP team polls to get more feedback

[00:18:34] <Rocket2DMn> Team, we don't want anybody to overstretch themselves, we realize that it can be draining over time. From my point of view, I would like to see people find something and focus energy toward it rather than bits and pieces everywhere

[00:18:35] <bodhi_zazen> /end rant ;)

[00:18:39] <ajmorris> joe and i will get an IRC meeting going at some point... even if it is very short, and just to get IRC hug days happening

[00:18:42] <jamesrfla> Bodsda: I can't keep up with all the trafic in #ubuntu

[00:18:50] <bodhi_zazen> +1 Rocket2DMn

[00:19:01] <easwar> nhandler, not everyone who would want to vote would have an LP a/c

[00:19:02] <Rocket2DMn> Don't get BT ADHD

[00:19:15] <Bodsda> jamesrfla, trust me, it gets easier

[00:19:19] <easwar> lol Rocket2DMn

[00:19:20] <nhandler> easwar: Most of the team has an LP account. They are also members of the BT on LP

[00:19:23] <bodhi_zazen> Again this is not a "requirement" it is an opportunity for those interested in doing more to come forward, offer ideas, and get involved

[00:19:35] <Rocket2DMn> I will try and organize a Wiki FG in a month or so, after the upcoming bugjam has come and gone and we get closer to Jaunty.

[00:19:46] <bodhi_zazen> thanks Rocket2DMn

[00:19:53] <nhandler> Rocket2DMn: When is the doc jam thing?

[00:20:03] <Rocket2DMn> not a doc jam nhandler , bugjam

[00:20:14] <nhandler> Rocket2DMn: I thought jono had organized a doc jam too

[00:20:27] <w4ett> jamesrfla the trick is to be able to focus on your one user you are trying to assist

[00:20:29] <Rocket2DMn> i havent heard about it nhandler

[00:20:34] <easwar> nhandler, yes,but what exactly is the use of voting on ourselves?The people who vote should be the people who are the recipients of our efforts

[00:20:46] <bodhi_zazen> Back on topic for a minute

[00:20:52] <ajmorris> \0/ OMG, hi w4ett

[00:20:58] <bodhi_zazen> any input / feedback on team leadership ?

[00:21:03] <bodhi_zazen> team goals ?

[00:21:07] <bodhi_zazen> personal goals ?

[00:21:11] <nhandler> Rocket2DMn: http://www.jonobacon.org/2009/02/04/rock-the-docs/

[00:21:15] <w4ett> hi ajmorris just back from red cross duties

[00:21:24] <bodhi_zazen> wb w4ett :)

[00:21:30] <nhandler> bodhi_zazen: I have a suggestion for the FGs

[00:21:33] <jamesrfla> I will try that w4ett

[00:21:37] <w4ett> thn Bodhi

[00:21:38] <bodhi_zazen> lets hear it nhandler

[00:21:45] <ajmorris> oh nice w4ett... we'll talk more when the meeting is done :)

[00:21:50] <w4ett> kk

[00:22:10] <nhandler> Most of them already have this, but I would like to propose that all FGs have at least 2 leaders. That way, if one goes inactive for a period of time, we can hopefully still have an active FG

[00:22:18] <bodhi_zazen> There seems to be continued confusion re: meetings / meeting times

[00:22:33] <nhandler> bodhi_zazen: I sent out a reminder. We also have the Google Calendar

[00:22:34 * easwar yawns

[00:22:38] <bodhi_zazen> I an not convinced the UTC 'thang works well

[00:22:44] <Bodsda> bodhi_zazen, yeah, 00:00 wed 11 could -- a wee bit confusing for people

[00:22:48] <brandon_p> +1 bodhi_zazen

[00:22:49] <easwar> bodhi_zazen, +1

[00:22:50] <Rocket2DMn> Another suggestion for FGs... Use the wiki! Keep your pages up to date. Some groups do this better than others, I'd be glad to help others get rolling with it

[00:22:59] <jamesrfla> +1 bodhi_zazen

[00:23:00] <bodhi_zazen> for those who are UTC impaired, please use gcal -> google calander

[00:23:08] <Bodsda> lol, impared

[00:23:21] <bodhi_zazen> meetings are posted on gcal and times are converted automagicaly from UTC to your time zone

[00:23:30] <ajmorris> what do you mean the UTC thing doesnt work well bodhi_zazen?... sometimes we have only the US times, which are useless to people like me

[00:23:38] <ajmorris> without UTC, im fscked

[00:23:42] <Bodsda> i like utc times :)

[00:23:42] <bodhi_zazen> so if you are confused re meetings, learn UTC or GCAL

[00:23:48] <jamesrfla> have both bodhi_zazen

[00:23:51] <ajmorris> im also too lazy to check gcal... so i need utc in the topic :P

[00:23:55] <jamesrfla> US and UTC

[00:24:04] <bodhi_zazen> jamesrfla: ajmorris we have BOTH already

[00:24:10] <easwar> bodhi_zazen, no problem with UTC timing,problem with the time you put in UTC

[00:24:10] <Bodsda> ajmorris, i feel a web based python script coming along

[00:24:11] <bodhi_zazen> and will continue with both

[00:24:16] <ajmorris> i know bodhi_zazen...

[00:24:32] <bodhi_zazen> I am UTC impaired :)

[00:24:33] <ajmorris> but bodhi_zazen, you said you're not convinved the UTC thing works well...

[00:24:38] <easwar> Bodsda, for adjusting time-zones?

[00:24:40 * ajmorris is confused...

[00:24:43] <ajmorris> what did you mean?

[00:24:45] <jamesrfla> maybe putting the UTC last...

[00:24:46] <bodhi_zazen> ajmorris yes, it seems to cause confusion

[00:25:03] <Bodsda> easwar, for getting the times -- yeah

[00:25:13] <ajmorris> tbh, i think votebot should have a meeting time function, that lets each user input their timezone, and it spits out the meeting time and date

[00:25:15] <bodhi_zazen> kk

[00:25:25] <Bodsda> nice idea

[00:25:26] <bodhi_zazen> leadership questions ?

[00:25:36] <nhandler> ajmorris: There is a bug preventing it from fetching the meeting time from the wiki on bodhi's server

[00:25:38] <bodhi_zazen> everyone happy with FG leaders ?

[00:25:48] <Bodsda> bodhi_zazen, central location for lists of leaders is where..?

[00:25:56] <nhandler> On the wiki Bodsda

[00:25:58] <Rocket2DMn> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BeginnersTeam/FocusGroups

[00:25:58] <ajmorris> it could fetch it from gcal nhandler?

[00:25:59] <bodhi_zazen> any FG leads who want co-leads ?

[00:26:02] <Bodsda> nhandler, uh huh which one

[00:26:03] <nhandler> o/

[00:26:08] <Bodsda> oh thanks Rocket2DMn

[00:26:11] <bodhi_zazen> for the team to grow we need the FG to grow

[00:26:25 * Bodsda nominates /me for co-leader

[00:26:26] <easwar> *FGs

[00:26:26] <nhandler> Bodsda: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BeginnersTeam/Meetings has it too

[00:26:32] <bodhi_zazen> nhandler: yes ?

[00:26:35] <Bodsda> cheers

[00:26:47] <nhandler> bodhi_zazen: I was just saying that I wanted a co-leader ;)

[00:26:56] <DrSmall> present

[00:27:03] <Bodsda> DrSmall, for me?

[00:27:04] <bodhi_zazen> I think I will let the FG teams / leads discuss co-leads

[00:27:11] <w4ett> nhandler pick one lol :P

[00:27:18] <AdamDV2> DrSmall :D

[00:27:22] <bodhi_zazen> if you want imput on FG leads, become involved with the team ;)

[00:27:27 * nathangrubb sounds the DrSmall alarm

[00:27:34] <Snova> nathangrubb: I was just thinking this was your fault.

[00:27:41] <DrSmall> this is the first time in awhile that I've been able to get here

[00:27:48] <nathangrubb> Snova: ?

[00:27:55 * easwar wonders what to do and watches everyone take cover

[00:28:03] <ajmorris> any more agenda items bodhi_zazen?

[00:28:08] <Snova> nathangrubb: Anybody else? :)

[00:28:18] <fedex1993> Hi ajmorrisand Rocket2DMn and Snova and DrSmall

[00:28:22] <nathangrubb> Snova: blame me for what?

[00:28:22] <easwar> Voting on Padawans

[00:28:25] <Bodsda> back on topic please guys

[00:28:30] <easwar> bodhi_zazen, ^

[00:28:32] <Rocket2DMn> hi fedex1993 , we're having a meeting right now

[00:28:34] <bodhi_zazen> I do not have any more items, BUT

[00:28:36] <DrSmall> sorry Bodsda

[00:28:41] <Bodsda> ty

[00:28:41] <zu22> DrSmall: we meet at last :) i have seen you on ACC

[00:28:46] <bodhi_zazen> I would like team input on growth / direction of the team

[00:28:48] <ajmorris> easwar does bodhi_zazen :0

[00:28:54] <zu22> bodhi_zazen: your snort guide kicked ass

[00:28:54] <DrSmall> zu22: shh

[00:29:04] <bodhi_zazen> thanks zu :)

[00:29:17] <Bodsda> bodhi_zazen, I like the way new faces keep cropping up, im not liking how they only crop up once or twice, are we doing enough to keep them?

[00:29:38] <ajmorris> Bodsda, you cant really do enough to keep them...

[00:29:45] <easwar> Bodsda, we probably need the niceties going

[00:29:50] <bodhi_zazen> I think recruitment can be improved, but on the other hand the motivated ones stay regardless ;)

[00:30:01] <ajmorris> +1 bodhi_zazen

[00:30:05] <bodhi_zazen> and I like that the team is low key, ie not a ego thing

[00:30:11] <ajmorris> if a new user crops up, but isnt really motivated, they leave

[00:30:17] <Bodsda> bodhi_zazen, yes, but would the non-motivated be more likely to get motivated if they felt more welcome?

[00:30:31] <bodhi_zazen> Possible Bodsda

[00:30:41 * easwar feels strangled between +1 Bodsda and +1 bodhi_zazen

[00:30:48 * nhandler runs to dinner

[00:30:56] <Bodsda> sometimes the discussions in this channel can be very very 'scary' to a new user

[00:30:57] <ajmorris> lol, the non-motivated users might stick around the IRC channel if they feel more welcome...

[00:31:07] <ajmorris> i cant see that helping them to stay and be *active* in the team...

[00:31:16] <brandon_p> +1 ajmorris

[00:31:19] <easwar> +1 ajmorris

[00:31:21] <Bodsda> ajmorris, they may just be shy?

[00:31:25] <bodhi_zazen> may I assume that we are all on board with the general goals / leadership I laid out for the team then ?

[00:31:26] <w4ett> ajmorris: it's the excitement of the new user at work regarding motivation

[00:31:37] <Rocket2DMn> +1 bodhi_zazen

[00:31:42] <PartyBoi2> +! bodhi_zazen

[00:31:44] <Bodsda> bodhi_zazen, yep

[00:31:45] <w4ett> the candle burns brightly at first

[00:31:46] <ajmorris> yep bodhi_zazen

[00:31:49] <easwar> +1 bodhi_zazen

[00:31:51] <bodhi_zazen> kk

[00:31:51] <sdennie> Yeah

[00:31:55] <Rocket2DMn> see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BeginnersTeam/MissionStatement

[00:31:59] <easwar> w4ett, and at the end too

[00:32:15] <ajmorris> brandon_p, can you change your name back to perlluver plz... its confusing... unless brandon_p is your new nick completely...

[00:32:16] <w4ett> easwar: you are right

[00:32:23] <brandon_p> sorry ajmorris

[00:32:33] <bodhi_zazen> If ANYONE would like guidance / input or assistance with personal goals and / or team involvement, please as either myself or the FG leads / co leads :)

[00:32:37] <jamesrfla> Hey zu22

[00:32:44] <bodhi_zazen> There is a lot we can do to grow

[00:32:53] <zu22> jamesrfla: hey man

[00:33:01] <bodhi_zazen> And I would like to see the irc mentoring sessions be our next goal

[00:33:15] <bodhi_zazen> we need teachers, documentation, and advertisement

[00:33:19] <ajmorris> hehe, tks perlluver :P its just i was about to ask who is brandon_p when i noticed your vHost :P

[00:33:20] <Rocket2DMn> Guys, if you want to be on a FG, add your name to the list at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BeginnersTeam/FocusGroups - this is THE MASTER LIST

[00:33:27] <Bodsda> bodhi_zazen, advertisement, how do we do this exactly?

[00:33:29] <bodhi_zazen> I set up a shared ssh session so we can teach the CLI

[00:33:31] <Rocket2DMn> FG leads will ping you if your name is on that list, otherwise they dont know

[00:33:34] <bodhi_zazen> lets use it ;)

[00:33:51] <easwar> danielvoicu is a PR guy

[00:34:04] <easwar> though haven't seen him in a long time

[00:34:06] <bodhi_zazen> advertisement on the forums, posting mentoring sessions, ##beginners-help, LP ect

[00:34:07] <Rocket2DMn> I have a question/suggestion for FG leads.

[00:34:17] <bodhi_zazen> sure Rocket2DMn

[00:34:39] <Bodsda> bodhi_zazen, forums, like where? ##beginners-help is only filled with our guys

[00:34:46] <Bodsda> im just unsure how to go about this

[00:34:49] <Rocket2DMn> I just noticed that some FG pages have a listing of members, can we PLEASE keep the main FocusGroups page as the listing and not keep FG members listed on specific FG pages

[00:35:21] <bodhi_zazen> ok with me ;)

[00:35:22] <Rocket2DMn> ahem IRC and Development

[00:35:27] <bodhi_zazen> up to the FG as well

[00:35:38] <ajmorris> Rocket2DMn, sorry, will remove it once i can load the page :P

[00:35:49] <ajmorris> my internet is foobarred atm

[00:35:54] <Rocket2DMn> no hurry ajmorris , its just impossible to track users across a half dozen pages

[00:35:56] <bodhi_zazen> Bodsda: ##beginners-help can be advertised on #ubuntu

[01:06:40] <ajmorris> w0w, that was the best lag spike ever...

[01:06:42] <st33med> Perl fails much?

[01:06:52] <st33med> >.>

[01:06:56] <bodhi_zazen> Any other items to discuss ?

[01:06:58] <Bodsda> st33med, isnt that its description? FAIL

[01:06:59] <jamesrfla> bodhi_zazen: do you have ﻿tim_sharitt UF profile link?

[01:07:08] <ibuclaw> st33med, it's not the language that is the bottleneck

[01:07:11] <ajmorris> it went from bodhi saying second on tim_sharitt, to all of the +1's being done... my internet sux0rs even more atm...

[01:07:11] <easwar> sdennie, terminal velocity question

[01:07:13] <ibuclaw> but the Network traffic

[01:07:41] <bodhi_zazen> w00t

[01:07:42] <ajmorris> thats why you have been taking so long jamesrfla? to check out their uf profile?!?

[01:07:52] <vantrax> not a bad ida

[01:07:54] <vantrax> idea

[01:07:54] <jamesrfla> yes ajmorris

[01:08:19 * easwar went from easwar seconds to Bodsda's virus statement to bodhi_zazen =1

[01:08:19] <perlluver> night fellas

[01:08:34] <Bodsda> cya perlluver

[01:08:36] <jamesrfla> PARTY!!!!

[01:08:37] <sdennie> The lag for VoteBot is because it the POE perl library throttles it to keep it from flooding and being kicked. The throttle can be unset though.

[01:08:38] <ajmorris> heh, if meetings over, im gonna take a shower...

[01:08:40] <nhandler> bodhi_zazen: Do we have a date for the next meeting?

[01:08:41 * Bodsda throws paper at everyone
