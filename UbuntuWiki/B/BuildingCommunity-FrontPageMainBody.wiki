'''Welcome to the Ubuntu Community Building site!'''

On these pages you will find help and guidance about how to build effective community teams that work to improve and refine the many different parts of the Ubuntu ecosystem. These pages are intended to provide some good solid guidance for running smooth, effective, productive and fun teams.

This is a collaborative resource, and if we all work to grow it, everyone benefits. If you feel something is missing, see the <nowiki>[[BuildingCommunity-Contribute|Contribute]]</nowiki> page to help improve this resource!
