=== Involvement ===

I have been getting increasingly involved with Ubuntu since Summer of 2010. I have contributed to bug-reports and given help to new users on the Ubuntu-UK list, and personally online. I have also become very involved as a member of the Ubuntu Advertising team. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuAdverts

=== Launchpad Profile ===
https://launchpad.net/~b-drake

=== Contributions so far ===

Apart from bug-reports and helping newcomers to Ubuntu, I have represented Ubuntu-Uk at the 2011 OpenSource Expo in London.  As a member of the adverts team, I have carried out a great deal of research prior to the advertising proposed to coincide with the launch of Natty.  See: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuAdverts/Research and the links from that page.  Much of the input is from me.  I am now lead for planning and education within the Ubuntu Advertising team, and have prepared the Creative Brief for phase-one of our campaign see: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuAdverts/Campaigns/education/creative_brief_a, and am working on a transitions online course 'Upgrading from Windows to Ubuntu'.  See: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuAdverts/training

=== Plans for the future ===

Working with the advertising team, I want to see the profile of Ubuntu raised in order to reach ordinary computer users and to show them that there is a 'better way'.  Some of this can be seen in the creative brief.  I am also exploring co-operation with 'barebones' manufacturers and suppliers to make available a range of tested pre-built computers for easy purchase.

=== Testimonials ===
Barry has put in many many hours in helping making the Ubuntu Adverts team what it is today. Besides writing  excellent documentation and launching creative ideas he also visited and contacted events and companies. He was able to convince a hardware supplier in selling Ubuntu systems. I also know he is actively involved with  Ubuntu-UK. I think Barry picks his projects carefully and fully dedicates himself to that. His work to promote Ubuntu is excellent and I think he is of great value for Ubuntu. -- <nowiki>[[UndiFineD]]</nowiki> (2011-04-04)

Barry has been a great contributor to the Ubuntu Adverts project. What stands out to me is his interest in user research. If Ubuntu is going to get to 100's of millions of users, we need to have a better understanding of people that use other OS's. Barry has done a fantastic job with few resources to give the Ubuntu Adverts team more knowledge about our marketing targets. If I were to describe Barry in one word, it would be 'adroit'. In order to grow our user base, we need more people like Barry who exhibit this important skill. Thank you b-drake! -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:mattgriffin]]</nowiki>
