__TOC__

For the preparation of the beta2 LTS release (see BetaProcess), uploads for packages in `main` and `restricted` are held in the queue and are subject to manual approval of the release team. The purpose is to stabilize the archive, allow the archive administrators to consolidate it and fix <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopment#Consistency|package inconsistencies]]</nowiki>, and be able to fix critical bugs quickly and in an isolated manner.

All exceptions require the approval of the release manager (see FreezeExceptionProcess), which is generally only granted if the upload fixes a bug which is milestoned for the beta2 LTS release and does not have any unrelated intrusive changes.

Once the Beta2Release is shipped, we roll back to FeatureFreeze, KernelFreeze, DocumentationStringFreeze, and UserInterfaceFreeze status.
