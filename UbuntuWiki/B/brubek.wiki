==== About ====

I'm a freshman to Ubuntu and Open Source Software movement. My very first experience with Linux was through Ubuntu Maverick Meerkat and I did get excited right away. Coming from Windows world of computing ideas it was something that opened my eyes on different levels. Since I'm not technically skilled yet, I'm trying my best on translations to my native language - Polish. At the same time I'm getting more and more interested in tech aspects of software and hardware alike.
