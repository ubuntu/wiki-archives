''(this is a sample team reporting page - feel free to cut and paste this into your team's wiki pages - e.g. wiki.ubuntu.com/<YourTeam>/ReportingPage - just cut out this little message and replace the YOURTEAM bits with your team's name)''

Welcome to the YOURTEAM reporting page. Every month this page should be filled with bullet points indicating the summary of some of the work you have been working on. As you work on something, try to summarise it here. A few guidelines for how to write good points here:

* Keep it simple and short - single sentences are best. :)
* Try to summarise your work and not be over-detailed - we don't need to know specifics, just a summary of the kind of work involved
* Where possible, include relevant links.

You should get all your reporting included here by the '''22nd''' of every month.
