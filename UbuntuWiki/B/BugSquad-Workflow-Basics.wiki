__TOC__

== Welcome to triage! ==
Since you're here, I'm assuming you are fairly new, or in the very least uncomfortable with the launchpad interface. No fear! We'll work through it slowly here.

=== Page Overview ===

To the right is an example of a launchpad page. As you can see, the layout is very minimal. So let me highlight a few important areas for you.
==== Login / Search ====
Below, you can see the login area. It is located in the top-left corner. It tells you who is currently logged into launchpad, or provides you with a link to login/register. If you haven't already, do it now. You won't be able to do anything without having an account and being logged into it!

This bar also contains the search box. This becomes useful later, especially when searching for duplicates. There is no search button, so just type and hit enter to perform a search.
==== Bug History ====
Below, you can see the section of the page relating the bug history. (It is located directly below the Login/Search area on the page) Some important things to note are the bug number (also present elsewhere on the page), who reported the bug, when the bug was reported, and the bug's activity log. Sometimes your response to a bug is dictated by how long ago it was reported, and what other people have done before you. It can also be helpful to know the experience level of the person who reported the bug. By clicking on their name, you should be able to see their level of activity with Ubuntu, and anticipate how much they know. This is why this section is extremely helpful. Quite frankly, it saves you work if a bug is too old, or is being taken care of by someone else (maybe with a lot more expertise than you, don't worry one day you'll be the pro!)

==== Title / Status Bar / Description ====
This is usually the most important section of the bug page in terms of information density. A good title, description, and an updated status can tell you almost everything you need to know about a bug. If these things are missing, you know its time to do work! Check it out below:

* The title is is large, red lettering, and contains a small yellow icon to its right. Clicking this icon will allow you to change the bug's title. 
* The status is the long white and yellow bar. It contains, at least one, but possibly multiple packages that the bug affects, and the status of the effort to correct the bug in those packages. Ubuntu is a catch-all package. Usually these bugs need to be edited and assigned to the correct package. You can think of packages as sub-units that make up ubuntu. They can be programs, libraries, drivers, or meta-packages that encompass several programs and their related libraries. It's really quite a flexible definition. You can also see the bug's status in other bug trackers, but more on that later.
