=== Report ===

The booth has been organized as described in this wiki (6 volunteers (Dieter, Jean, Joris, Kenneth, Mike and Peter), enough hardware (5 laptops and one additional TV screen) and material. 

The Dipro Computer fair was coupled with a photography fair at the same place : the Ubuntu-be was located close to the main entrance to both fairs, a very good location, and was attractive for the public.

The work was organized as follow (the flow of the public was mostly in 1 direction) : 
TV screen + 1 laptop at the beginning of the booth with one volunteer to address the public attracted by the presentation (wiki : Ubuntu_short_presentation-NL.odp) ;
4 volunteers in front of the booth (for an easier contact with visitors) to address the public, giving explanations and demonstrations (4 laptop's), distributing flyers and cd's ;
1 volunteer at the other side of the booth for other explanation without computer and general control/security of the booth. 

Our booth (3 tables) was correctly decorated with table cloth (too short), posters and an inflatable tux, but we could do better. 
Suggestions : 
use of bigger table cloth (it should cover not only the upper part of the table but also front side);
we need some kind of support (screen) with posters as background of  the booth ;
working with laptop is not easy when you and the visitor are standing at a table, we should find a simple solution to elevate the laptop('s) with a +/- 30 cm high support.

WiFi was available, and useful (but slow). 

We distributed approximatively 100 flyers, 80 information sheets and 80 cd's Ubuntu 8.10 (+ a few other versions), always on request of interested persons and with explanation. 

From 10 to 14 h. : many interested visitors, we were permanently busy with questions, explanations and demonstrations (full manning of the booth was necessary !). From 14 to 15.30 h. : less visitors, but permanently 2 or 3 visitors with questions. Till the end (17 h.) people came through with some questions, the last one when the computers were already off.

Some people did not know about the existence of Ubuntu, likely they were more interested by the photography fair than in computer, but we succeed to attract their attention. 
The (slideshow) general presentation of Ubuntu has been successful for this public.
 
Many questions about the co-existence Ubuntu - Windows (dualboot) and how to work with a live-cd. When possible, we combined explanation and demonstration. 
Suggestion : we should prepare short video's  (without comment) as demonstration to explain :
the step “Partitioning – where to install Ubuntu” during the install process ;
the dual-boot Ubuntu – Windows.

Other frequent questions were about existing (MS) software, such as Office and MSN messenger. We explained the existing aternatives.
I (Mike) also mentioned Wubi to some people interested in installing dualboot, but didn't want to start partitioning.

Finance : after reimbursement of the booth-fee, 28 euro were transferred to Ubuntu-be account.

Summary : it was a successful event for Ubuntu promotion.
