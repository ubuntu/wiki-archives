Describe bobbybiceps here.

Former owner of two businesses, currently retired.  Became interested in Linux and specifically Ubuntu from my son, who has been an expert using Linux for several years.

I have used Unix in a LAN with one of my businesses, was forced to use MS Windows to be compatible with our corporate office in the other business. 

I now have the time to learn a lot more about Ubuntu Linux and would like to get involved in any way that I can.  Current areas of interest are networking and desktop.  I am in the Central Time Zone, USA.  Available from around 8:00 AM until 10:00 PM.
