=== Report ===

We haven't had logistical difficulties, the booth looked quite OK. We've had a few questions from people, mostly about installation or hardware support, and talked to some people who know Linux (at least by name) but wanted to try an up to date distribution. 

Generally we didn't attract a big crowd; I think we gave away about 30 of 35 cdroms including self-burned ones, which is not a lot. The fair itself is well-attended, but not a big success anymore (I went to my first dipro fair about ten years ago and I recall it to be bigger, eg generally not sharing a space with a record or photography fair). We also overheard someone from the Dipro organization saying that "it will be a while before there will be another fair in Leuven". 

As for gifts, we were almost break even with the booth fees (short of a few cents).
