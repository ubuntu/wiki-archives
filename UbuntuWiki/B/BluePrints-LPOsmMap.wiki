== Use of OSM maps on Launchpad ==

=== Abstract ===

At the moment, Launchpad user pages use Google Maps. This seems a bit wrong considering Google is non-free. OpenStreetMap on the other hand is free.

This proposal proposes the replacement of Google Maps with OpenStreetMap using the OpenLayers system.

=== Rationale ===

Launchpad is supposed to be for the hosting of Free Software, so having a non-free map is wrong.

=== Other uses of OSM ===

It is possible to use OSM maps without using OpenLayers. The following are examples.

There is a OSM wiki page about deploying a OSM map, see http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Deploying_your_own_Slippy_Map
