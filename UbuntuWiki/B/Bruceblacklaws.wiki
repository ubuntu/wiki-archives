__TOC__

I currently stay in Cape Town, South Africa. I am really into Computer Security and GNU/Linux. Heh, I have used over 40 GNU/Linux Distributions over the years. I am planning on adding Ubuntu to my list right after I am given it a go. My favorite GNU/Linux disto would be Gentoo(heh, I shouldn't say that here :D)... checkout my personal homepage at http://www.bruceblacklaws.com for more information about me.
