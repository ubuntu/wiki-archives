This was a fairly short meeting, primarily an update of team activities.

'''Turnout was a success !'''

1. Bodhi.zazen joined the staff as a moderator.

2. The team has established a mailing list with google groups. Register with google and go here :

Ask to become a member of the team (the group is private on google and membership is approved by Toxicity).
