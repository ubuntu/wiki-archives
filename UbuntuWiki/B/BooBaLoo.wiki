Well.
My name is Oleg. I start to have tight relations with open-source movement, GNU & FSF at winter 2008. From that time I work mostly as a translator of various projects on LP's Rosetta and Transifex. 
I'm also very interested in vector graphics and particularly — Inkscape. You can <nowiki>[[http://www.openclipart.org/user-detail/boobaloo|find me]]</nowiki> at <nowiki>[[http://openclipart.org|Open Clip Art Library]]</nowiki> – great site with great cliparts in PublicDomain and also great peoples. yep.

Like to work with CSS, HTML. Exploring PHP, JavaScript, jQuery, MySQL,…

Feel free to <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~koptev-oleg|contact me]]</nowiki> through Launchpad if you need to, or simply want to waffle on.

Best wishes, from Russia with love, Oleg.
