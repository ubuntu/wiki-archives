== Community Question Time ==

Community Question Time is a monthly IRC session with Jono Bacon, the Ubuntu Community Manager in which you can ask your questions about the Ubuntu community and he can answer them. This is an open, public meeting that anyone is invited to attend, and everyone is welcome to submit their questions.

=== Next Community Question Time session ===

* '''WHEN:''' Mon 2rd April at 15:00-16:00 UTC
* '''WHERE:''' #ubuntu-meeting on irc.freenode.net

=== How the session works ===

In the session, the #ubuntu-meeting IRC channel will be moderated so only Jono can speak. 

To ask a question, do the following:

* Join the #ubuntu-meeting-questions channel.
* Ask your question and begin it with 'QUESTION:' (e.g. "QUESTION: How will foo happen?).
* Wait for the response in #ubuntu-meeting

Due to the high volume of questions and limited length of the session, not all questions can be answered unfortunately, so don't be disheartened if yours is not.
