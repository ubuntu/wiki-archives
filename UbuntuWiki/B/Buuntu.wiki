=== About Me ===
Currently, I am an active member in <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org]]</nowiki> and am frequently on several Ubuntu channels in IRC.  I try to assist others in any way I can.  My main goal right now is to become very fluent in Ubuntu and other Linux distros.  Eventually, I hope to be able to develop software and write programs to contribute to the Ubuntu community.

=== Contributions ===
I am an active member in <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org]]</nowiki> and try to help people out as much as I can.  I also try to answer questions in #ubuntu-beginners and #ubuntu-beginners-help.

=== Other ===
I am looking for anyone who is willing to teach about Ubuntu, hardware/software, programming, or other related topics.  Any kind of help is appreciated.
