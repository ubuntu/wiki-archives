It is mainly designed for group communication in discussion forums, called channels, but also allows one-to-one communication via private message as well as chat. <<BR>><<BR>>For more about IRC, please visit <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat|the Wikipedia]]</nowiki>.

Like many other Ubuntu teams, Ubuntu-BD uses <nowiki>[[InternetRelayChat|IRC]]</nowiki> as a form of communication. Most of the communication outside of the Mailing List and Forum, as well as the monthly Ubuntu-BD meetings, take place in the Ubuntu-BD IRC channels:

Our IRC channel is '''<nowiki>[[irc:--irc.freenode.net:8001-#ubuntu-bd|#ubuntu-bd]]</nowiki>''' (<nowiki>[[http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=ubuntu-bd|In your browser]]</nowiki>). Apart from the monthly meeting, members are encouraged to take part in the channel by discussing about the community or providing support/solutions to the newcomers.

Anyone can connect to the Ubuntu-BD IRC channel using an IRC client such as <nowiki>[[http://www.pidgin.im/|Pidgin]]</nowiki> or <nowiki>[[http://xchat.org/|XChat]]</nowiki> or <nowiki>[[http://konversation.kde.org/|Konversation]]</nowiki>, by pointing your client to '''irc.freenode.net:8001''' and joining the channel '''ubuntu-bd'''.

Freenode prefers users to connect on the non-standard port of 8001 to prevent DCC problems that can disconnect users Routers from the Internet. Please use this port ''especially'' if you are unable to update your Router's firmware to the latest available.

=== Rules ===

==== Channel Ground Rules ====

While in the Ubuntu-BD IRC channels (and in any Ubuntu channel) you are expected to abide by the <nowiki>[[http://ubuntu.com/community/conduct|Ubuntu Code of Conduct]]</nowiki> (CoC). Most of what is applicable to the IRC Channels can be summarized as follows (taken from <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/community/conduct|ubuntu.com]]</nowiki>):

 '''''Be respectful.''' The Ubuntu community and its members treat one another with respect. Everyone can make a valuable contribution to Ubuntu. We may not always agree, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It's important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. We expect members of the Ubuntu community to be respectful when dealing with other contributors as well as with people outside the Ubuntu project, and with users of Ubuntu.''

==== Channel Guidelines ====

|}

In addition to the above ground rules, we have a guide to help the members make the best use of our channel.  New members are requested to familiarize themselves with the ground rules and the guide lines before participating in the chatroom.

* There will be no profanity allowed in Ubuntu-bd Channel. We get many kinds of people, from all over the world, of all ages in our channels, and we wish to keep the channels friendly to all users. 
* There will be no user-run bots allowed in the channel. If you place a bot in one of our channels, you will be asked to remove it. If it is not removed immediately, it will be kicked from the channel.
* We don't mind if you tell us about a great newspaper column or the great deal you found on the market or even your awesome new whatever you posted on the net, but keep it sane.  If you get annoying, you may get kicked. Just try to keep it reasonable.
* We try to be very laid back in the Ubuntu-bd Channel. There are lots of lighthearted chatter and discussion. If you come into our channel and start throwing a bad attitude around, or act rudely to other users, you may be asked to calm down. Continual abusive behavior will lead to the offending user being kicked. We have no place for rude and obnoxious people in the chatroom. Keep the attitudes under control, and it can be an enjoyable chat experience for all.
* Don't post your phone number or mailing address to the channel without understanding the potential consequences. It is better to send personal information by private email.
* While a discussion is going on, if you want to say something then please raise your hand by '''o/''' or ''' \o'''
* If you agree with someone or some matter, then type '''+1'''. In case of a disagreement type '''-1'''.

=== Register a Username on Freenode ===

The <nowiki>[[http://freenode.net/|Freenode network]]</nowiki> is the home to many participants in free software and free content projects. To prevent the identity theft or to maintain the authenticity of a user, we suggest to register your nickname on Freenode, so that no one except you can use your nickname. The registration process is simple and only takes a few minutes. To register yourself on the free node please follow the steps below.

* Open your favorite IRC client (<nowiki>[[http://www.pidgin.im/|Pidgin]]</nowiki>/<nowiki>[[http://xchat.org/|XChat]]</nowiki>/<nowiki>[[http://konversation.kde.org/|Konversation]]</nowiki>) or <nowiki>[[http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=ubuntu-bd|use your browser]]</nowiki> to go to IRC channel and type:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <style="text-align: left; background-color: #F1F1DD;"> ''/server irc.freenode.net''
|}
* '''Choose a user name or nick.''' This user name should consist only of the letters from A-Z, the numbers from 0-9 and certain symbols such as "_" and "-". It may have a maximum of 16 characters. You can use the English letter only, no other letters (such as Bangla letters) can not be used.
* '''Change your username to the username you have chosen.''' Suppose you have chosen the nick "your_username". Type the following in the window titled Freenode:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <style="text-align: left; background-color: #F1F1DD;"> ''/nick your_username''
|}
* '''Register your nick or username.''' Type the following command and replace "your_password" with a password that will be easy to remember, and replace "your_email_address" with your email address.
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <style="text-align: left; background-color: #F1F1DD;"> ''/msg nickserv register your_password your_email_address''
|}
* '''Verify your registration.''' After you register, you will not be able to identify to NickServ until you have verified your registration. To do this, check your email for an account verification code.
* '''Group an alternate nickname with your main one.''' If you would like to register an alternate nickname, first switch to the alternate nickname that you want while you are identified as the main one, then group your nicks together with the following command:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <style="text-align: left; background-color: #F1F1DD;"> ''/msg nickserv group''
|}
* '''Identify with Nickserv.''' Each time you connect, you should sign in, or "identify" yourself, using the following command:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <style="text-align: left; background-color: #F1F1DD;"> ''/msg nickserv identify your_password''
|}

If you need to share output from your system with other people in the channel and it's more than 1 or 2 lines long, you should use a pastebin; <nowiki>[[http://ubuntu-bd.pastebin.com/]]</nowiki> is a good one to use.
