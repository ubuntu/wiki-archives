__TOC__

Would it be smart to include a couple things to say to a forum HOWTO author to encourage them to give permission to use their content?  For instance:

 A. People can make minor edits to mistakes or typos, add relevant links, etc.
 A. If you should for some reason stop maintaining the guide, it will still be maintainable by other people, meaning that it can be linked to with less fear that it will one day be obsolete (as a forum topic might)
 A. It will be centrally located within the Community Wiki, making it in theory easier to find and more "trustworthy"/"official" to newcomers
