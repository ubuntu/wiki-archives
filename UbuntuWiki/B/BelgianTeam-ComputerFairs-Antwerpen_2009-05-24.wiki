=== Report ===

The booth has been organized as described in this wiki (3 volunteers
(Willem, Jean, Matthew) due to 2 cancellations and 1 non appearance),
enough hardware (3 laptops, 1PC, 1 additional TV screen and 1 beamer) and
additional material.

The Dipro Computer fair was coupled with a photography fair at the same
place. the Ubuntu-be booth was located inside the rows at a unfavorable
location, but next to the booth of Computerclub C&T. There was not enough 
place for visitors to walk.

The work was organized as follow : TV screen + 1 laptop at the beginning
of the booth, 1 or 2 volunteers in front of the booth (for an easier
contact with visitors) to address the public attracted by the
presentation (see wiki : Ubuntu_short_presentation-NL.odp), giving
explanations and demonstrations (1 laptop and 1 PC), distributing flyers
and cd's ; 1 volunteer at the other side of the booth for other
explanation with 1 laptop + beamer and general control/security of the
booth.

Our booth (2 tables) was too small for our deployment and we lacked of
depth back of the booth due to other booths material. We should ask the
Dipro organization at least 3 tables and a better location (like at a wall and close to the main entrance)

The booth was correctly decorated with table cloth, posters, flyers,
plastic stands with A4 and A6 flyers. We improvised a kind of support
with sticks to fix 3 posters as background of the booth. Working with
laptop on the table is not easy when you and the visitor are standing in
front of the table, we should find a simple solution to elevate the
laptop('s) with a ± 30 cm high support.

No WiFi, nor internet connection.

We distributed approximatively 100 flyers, 80 information sheets, 60
explanation sheet about live-cd's and 100 cd's Ubuntu 9.04 (+ a few
other versions), always on request of interested persons and with
explanation.

From 10 to 15 h. : many interested visitors, we were permanently busy
with questions, explanations and demonstrations (full manning of the
booth with more than 3 volunteers was necessary !). From 15 to 16.30 h.
: less visitors, but permanently 2 or 3 visitors with questions. Till
16.30 h. people came through with some questions.

Most visitors knew about Ubuntu and were interested by additional
information. Some people did not know about the existence of Ubuntu,
likely they were more interested by the photography fair than in
computer, but we succeed to attract their attention. The (slide show)
general presentation of Ubuntu has been successful for this public.

Many questions about the co-existence Ubuntu - Windows (dual boot) and
how to work with a live-cd. When possible, we combined explanation and
demonstration. Suggestion : we should prepare short video's (without
comment) as demonstration to explain : the step “Partitioning – where to
install Ubuntu” during the install process ; the dual-boot Ubuntu –
Windows.

Finance : after reimbursement of the booth fee, 61,58 euro were
transferred to Ubuntu-be account by Matthew.

Summary : it was a very successful event for Ubuntu promotion, but not
enough volunteers (1 from Antwerp and 2 coming from Ostend).
