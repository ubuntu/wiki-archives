==== Wiki ====
May 06 19:10:34 <bodhi_zazen>	Focus group : Wiki

May 06 19:10:40 <paultag>	st33med: bring it to beginners

May 06 19:10:42 <bodhi_zazen>	st33med, yes, as a last resort

May 06 19:10:48 <Rocket2DMn>	yes wiki

May 06 19:10:49 <st33med>	bodhi_zazen, there is no dev

May 06 19:11:00 <bodhi_zazen>	comments Rocket2DMn re wiki ?

May 06 19:11:02 <Old_Soldier>	what about source?

May 06 19:11:06 <Rocket2DMn>	so if any of the Focus Groups want a wiki page, let me know, we now have one for the wiki team and security team

May 06 19:11:13 <Old_Soldier>	id compile beofre i aliened tbh

May 06 19:11:15 <st33med>	Old_Soldier, to ##beginners-help 

May 06 19:11:28 <Rocket2DMn>	on another wiki note:

May 06 19:12:00 <Rocket2DMn>	the community documentation is now outdated because of hardy, so if there is something you are good at, it would be helpful to update community docs at help.ubuntu.com/community

May 06 19:12:06 <bodhi_zazen>	OOps ...

May 06 19:12:10 <Rocket2DMn>	just take it slow and easy since we don't own that space

May 06 19:12:29 <bodhi_zazen>	If you see something that should be added here : http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=773851

May 06 19:12:34 <bodhi_zazen>	please let me know

May 06 19:12:44 <bodhi_zazen>	My thoughts re: wiki

May 06 19:12:55 <bodhi_zazen>	the wiki is a complex structure ..
.
May 06 19:13:11 <bodhi_zazen>	One goal I had was to get BT memebers to wiki

May 06 19:13:38 <bodhi_zazen>	My thought was to get experience writing FAQ or frequent forums answers to the BT wiki pages

May 06 19:14:05 <bodhi_zazen>	If you want to work on the wiki in general :

May 06 19:14:18 <bodhi_zazen>	1. consider joining the wiki mailing team

May 06 19:14:40 <bodhi_zazen>	Rocket2DMn, can you add a link for that to our BT wiki focus group page ?

May 06 19:15:01 <bodhi_zazen>	2. Do not re-create the wheel. If a wiki page exists update / modify that

May 06 19:15:27 <bodhi_zazen>	for example, search the wiki pages for encryption, I think there are 12 wiki pages on encryption.

May 06 19:15:46 <Rocket2DMn>	bodhi_zazen, do you have the link to join the mailing group?

May 06 19:15:46 <bodhi_zazen>	better consolidate them all into 1 or 2 more complete pages

May 06 19:15:59 <bodhi_zazen>	Rocket2DMn, yea, I can get it in a sec

May 06 19:16:14 <bodhi_zazen>	3. If you need help w/ wik ask

May 06 19:16:21 <Rocket2DMn>	<--- ask

May 06 19:16:27 <bodhi_zazen>	I am on the mailing team and there is also #ubutu-doc

May 06 19:17:14 <bodhi_zazen>	Rocket2DMn, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ContributeToUbuntu

May 06 19:18:09 <Rocket2DMn>	ok thank you

May 06 19:18:26 <bodhi_zazen>	Rocket2DMn, this is better : https://wiki.ubuntu.com/

May 06 19:18:52 <bodhi_zazen>	Ah , here : https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-doc

May 06 19:18:54 <Rocket2DMn>	do you want people to help on help.ubuntu.com or wiki.ubuntu.com

May 06 19:19:04 <bodhi_zazen>	Rocket2DMn, either

May 06 19:19:14 <bodhi_zazen>	any other wiki info ?

May 06 19:19:29 <Rocket2DMn>	nope

==== Security ====
May 06 19:19:47 <bodhi_zazen>	OK, security team ?

May 06 19:20:01 <Rocket2DMn>	tronyx, ping

May 06 19:20:11 <bodhi_zazen>	There is an influx of new users, make sure they understand security

May 06 19:20:13 <bodhi_zazen>	lol

May 06 19:20:33 <tronyx>	yo

May 06 19:20:37 <Old_Soldier>	please oh please write up something about shileds up and "stealth"

May 06 19:20:47 <paultag>	ahaha

May 06 19:20:48 <Bodsda>	security is flogged off in #ubuntu -- people ask about and are told not to bother

May 06 19:20:48 <bodhi_zazen>	Old_Soldier, good one

May 06 19:20:48 <Old_Soldier>	i don't have the patience or niceness to handle that

May 06 19:20:50 <paultag>	tronyx: give them a website

May 06 19:20:56 <tronyx>	we need a wiki entry that says "if you ask about shields up you get stabbed like a mother fucker"

May 06 19:21:08 <bodhi_zazen>	Bodsda, that is bad advice

May 06 19:21:18 <bodhi_zazen>	at least link 'em to the security thread

May 06 19:21:19 <vor-ubuntu>	tronyx: Haha

May 06 19:21:24 <bodhi_zazen>	Linux severs can be hacked

May 06 19:21:36 <Bodsda>	bodhi_zazen, not me giving it -- but i see it alot, and dont know enough about security to correct them

May 06 19:21:45 <bodhi_zazen>	Bodsda, jsut post the link

May 06 19:21:49 <Bodsda>	what link?

May 06 19:21:55 <tronyx>	bodhi_zazen's security link is the best thing for beginners

May 06 19:22:04 <Bodsda>	tronyx, link me plz

May 06 19:22:04 <bodhi_zazen>	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=510812

May 06 19:22:06 <paultag>	tronyx++;

May 06 19:22:06 <Bodsda>	ty

May 06 19:22:12 <Bodsda>	bookmarked

May 06 19:22:17 <tronyx>	i have honestly though of, "how can i write a better guide" i cannot.  it is simple, straight to the point and right there

May 06 19:22:39 <bodhi_zazen>	That link was written by me and reviewed by the staff (mods & admins)

May 06 19:22:42 <bodhi_zazen>	and tronx

May 06 19:22:49 <tronyx>	people that post "how can i secure my system" in the security section, right below bodhi_zazen's sticky will most likely not properly secure their box

May 06 19:22:53 <Bodsda>	il talk to #ubuntu-ops about getting a !security added with that link

May 06 19:23:11 <bodhi_zazen>	thanks Bodsda

==== Launchpad ====
May 06 19:23:23 <bodhi_zazen>	Launchpad team ?

May 06 19:25:39 <bodhi_zazen>	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Beginners/BTMeetings

==== Beginners Team Tracker ====
May 06 19:25:53 <bodhi_zazen>	#2 BT tracker

May 06 19:26:03 <Rocket2DMn>	yes, the tracker, a work in progress

May 06 19:26:13 <bodhi_zazen>	the tracker for UA was down after forums upgrade

May 06 19:26:14 <Old_Soldier>	if you guys wanna launchpad thats a good candidate

May 06 19:26:22 <bodhi_zazen>	BT tracker in progress

May 06 19:26:24 <Rocket2DMn>	the Unanswered Posts team has an simple online tracker with a FF plugin

May 06 19:26:37 <Rocket2DMn>	I got my hands on the code and modified it to our purposes, but it's still not complete

May 06 19:26:48 <bodhi_zazen>	Rocket2DMn, need help ?

May 06 19:26:53 <Rocket2DMn>	Kidders, the guy who wrote the UA tracker code suggested we might modify it to work for both teams on the same site

May 06 19:26:57 <paultag>	Rocket2DMn: I will donate some of my server, and time to get it working

May 06 19:26:58 <Old_Soldier>	Rocket2DMn: change the icon please

May 06 19:27:08 <Rocket2DMn>	he's hard to get ahold of, but that might be a more interesting path to take

May 06 19:27:08 <Old_Soldier>	for those of us on both teams...

May 06 19:27:25 <Rocket2DMn>	we already have serverspace on codechunk.net

May 06 19:27:33 <bodhi_zazen>	I encourage team members to join UA

May 06 19:27:38 <Rocket2DMn>	http://bt.codechunk.net/

May 06 19:27:38 <paultag>	ok, Rocket2DMn:  I have a godaddy server, if we need it

May 06 19:27:41 <paultag>	ok

May 06 19:27:42 <paultag>	cool then

May 06 19:27:46 <bodhi_zazen>	OK, I am going to skip to #4

May 06 19:27:52 <Bodsda>	whats #4?

May 06 19:27:56 <Bodsda>	what happened to #3?

May 06 19:27:58 <Rocket2DMn>	i wont be able to get to work on it for another month or so though, so it's on hold

==== BT Title/Avatar ====
May 06 19:28:12 <bodhi_zazen>	#4 is an offshoot of the idea of a BT title / avatar on the fourms

May 06 19:28:17 <Bodsda>	ok

May 06 19:28:20 <bodhi_zazen>	Bodsda, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Beginners/BTMeetings

May 06 19:28:30 <Bodsda>	aaahhh,., got ya

May 06 19:28:33 <Rocket2DMn>	I just want to use the tracker for posts that you need help with

May 06 19:28:51 <bodhi_zazen>	We can not do custom titles, but we could do a team avatar or avatar themes

May 06 19:28:54 <Rocket2DMn>	some people use the UA tracker for all posts, i think that is overkill and floods with useless links to posts

May 06 19:29:02 <bodhi_zazen>	Is there any interest ?

May 06 19:29:12 <bodhi_zazen>	Interest in "senior" memvers only ?

May 06 19:29:15 <paultag>	bodhi_zazen: I'll follow it

May 06 19:29:15 <Old_Soldier>	Rocket2DMn: thats what aj wanted

May 06 19:31:22 <bodhi_zazen>	Same avatar has the advantage in that it identifies the team

May 06 19:31:23 <Rocket2DMn>	paultag, that would need some major photoshopping buddy

May 06 19:31:25 <Bodsda>	well everyones blaitantly gonna post a pic of themselves

May 06 19:33:26 <paultag>	Rocket2DMn: one time for a sweet team theme

May 06 19:33:46 <Bodsda>	the core pic would have to stand out so the avatars can be noticely grouped

May 06 19:39:33 <paultag>	bodhi_zazen: ok, cool -- I was just throwing ideas around, I like the idea of keeping a team theme going

May 06 19:39:35 <bodhi_zazen>	Made w/ gimp and adding some interesting features, using a piece of the bird, like head ?

May 06 19:39:52 <bodhi_zazen>	OK, last #3

==== Ubuntu-classroom Mentoring ====

May 06 19:41:38 <bodhi_zazen>	Most of the more experienced members are willing to teach
