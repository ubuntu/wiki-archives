Hi! I'm Ben, and I help out with the kernel work for Ubuntu. I joined Canonical in 2016 but have been an Ubuntu fan since 2005. :)

If you'd like to contact me, please look me up on freenode in #ubuntu or #ubuntu-kernel, I'm ben_r. Or, you can email me at <nowiki>[[mailto:benjamin.romer@canonical.com|my Canonical email address]]</nowiki>.
