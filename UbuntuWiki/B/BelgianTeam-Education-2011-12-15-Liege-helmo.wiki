Adrien Rami:

My presentation of Ubuntu was succesful, all went very good. There is few questions about Ubuntu and it's futur. And also about Unity and difference between Fedora and Ubuntu. The students told me that it was a very good presentation, easy and very interesting. They will contact Ubuntu for a other presentation next year.
