Report

The fair wasn't really big, but a lot of people came by at our booth.
Some of them already knew of the existence of linux/ubuntu, some already used (or tried to use it), and ome had no clue at all.
But what they all had in common was a big interest in Ubuntu.
Some people came with specific question, e.g. how to set up the keyboard, or which packet they had to repair. Others just wanted a small demonstration of Ubuntu.
All the questions we had, we tried to give an as good as possible answer, and all the people got away satisfied with their answer.
The four of us ( hfsdo,  schwarz_p, JanC & yanu)had brought with us the following equipment fot the booth: 2 desktop PC's, one for burning CD's, one for an installation demo (with both Jaunty & Karmic); an IBM Thinkpad, with XP in Virtualbox; 2 Asus EEE netbooks, one with a beamer on it; 2 laptops, one Medion, one Packard Bell.
With the beamer we displayed the Ubuntu-Be Impress Presentation and Big Buck Bunny. When we explained to people we showed that movie because it was completely created with Free Software, they were impressed.
Most of the people were gratefull for the LiveCD and promissed to test it at home, other, I think, took it because it was free (the beer-like way), but who knows, one day they still test it out.
