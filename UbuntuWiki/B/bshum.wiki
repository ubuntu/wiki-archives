=== About Me ===

My first Linux OS was Ubuntu 9.04 and I have been using Ubuntu OS for my laptop computers ever since.  To me, the greatness of open source is the flexibility and possibility to do anything you want with it.

My background is in computer systems administration and I'm an MLS student studying to become a librarian.  My current job tasks me with setting up and administrating our implementation of <nowiki>[[http://evergreen-ils.org/|Evergreen Open Source Integrated Library System]]</nowiki>, which will be run on Ubuntu.  I also provide feedback for bug tracking via the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/evergreen|Evergreen Launchpad]]</nowiki> site.
