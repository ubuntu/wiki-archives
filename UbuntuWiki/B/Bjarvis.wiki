__TOC__

Hey there, this is my personal page for the Ubuntu Wiki.

I currently use Ubuntu 5.10 PPC on an ancient PowerMac (733Mhz), and have been involved in the Xubuntu project from early in its inception.

I'm also seeking to start a LoCo group in the Elkhart, Indiana area; so if you're in the area, drop me a note.
