Hello everybody,

under the influence of HUG DAYs and amazing community efforts Bug Triage became a matter of not only developers but the community in general interested in Ubuntu's health and success in the last months. For some it became sort of a sport. 

The great thing about the BugSquad is that it spreads over the full variety of Ubuntu's teams, members of the Desktop Team, the Kubuntu team, the MOTU world and so on. In order to make this team better and to get most out of the ten weeks until release, we will have a meeting to found the official Ubuntu BugSquad!

If you have time on Mon 27 March 15:00 UTC, be sure to visit #ubuntu-meeting and add your agenda point to https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BugSquad/Meeting

Have a nice day,
 the BugSquad
