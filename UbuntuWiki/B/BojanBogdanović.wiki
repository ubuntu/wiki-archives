=== About Me ===
My name is Bojan Bogdanović (my nickname is bojce) and i am a Serbian IT administrator/manager and FLOSS enthusiast. I am using Linux since 2004, and Ubuntu exclusively since 2006. Since 2007/02/17 member of Ubuntu LoCo Serbia. Contact/coordinator of <nowiki>[[http://loco.ubuntu.com/teams/ubuntu-rs | Ubuntu LoCo Serbia]]</nowiki> become in february 2009. Community that i am leading have more than 3,900 forum users and <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-rs | 89]]</nowiki> core members.
Over the years I have installed a large number of computers, commercially or privately, including the installation of Linux and OpenSource software on other operating systems. Also, as a member (and later leader) of the Ubuntu Community Serbia, I held 20+ lectures and presentations throughout Serbia.
I wrote articles for FLOSS magazin Gnuzilla (lokal Serbian e-magazine) and now write for e-magazine LiBRE (also, i am one of editors).

* Dialogue with institutions
Serbian LoCo Team (including me as a part of the team) is devoted to expanding FLOSS software usage, both in society and civil institutions; therefore, we consider dialogues with institutions representatives to be an important part of process. During the years, major steps have been taken in that direction, and dialogue with following institutions has been established:
* <nowiki>[[http://www.digitalnaagenda.gov.rs/|Ministry of Telecommunications and Digital Development]]</nowiki>,
* <nowiki>[[http://www.poverenik.org.rs/|Commissioner  for Information of Public Importance and Personal Data Protection  Office]]</nowiki>,
* <nowiki>[[http://www.ombudsman.rs/|Ombudsman of the Republic of Serbia]]</nowiki>,
* <nowiki>[[http://www.erazvoj.com/|E-development – association devoted to digital development]]</nowiki>,
Commissioner  for Information of Public Importance and Personal Data Protection  Office is the first institution in Serbia that expressed interest and intention to switch completely to FLOSS software and Ubuntu. For this purpose, the team is preparing and adapting additional applications, and this project is considered to be strategic in establishing precedent in Serbia.
<nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~urosldp | Uros]]</nowiki> and me were delegated to represent the Community in these contacts.
==== Education support ====
* Serbian team expressed interest in supporting schools in tree Belgrade Municipalities (Vracar, Stari Grad and Rakovica) where elementary schools students use Edubuntu based programs. We plan to set up the infrastructure to help them coordinate and improve skills, both of teachers and students. We have the opportunity to participate in program as a official software support.  
'''Facts:'''
* Rakovica municipality – 2104 computers in 14 schools
* Vracar municipality – 2017 computers in 11 schools
* Stari grad municipality – 617 computers in 7 schools
* Edubuntu 12.04. - 100% localized
We  upgrade computers to Edubuntu 12.04 LTS in May; for that purpose, LoCo members are translated additional applications, and customize Edubuntu as well.

I first saw Bojan at Ubuntu presentation in May 2010. After that I discovered that his is coordinator of the Ubuntu-rs community and forum. As a coordinator he is very professional and kind in resolving any forum issues or conflicts, also he is always willing to help resolving any problems regarding Ubuntu usage and administration. As a presenter he is confident and concise presenting always up to date data and facts about Ubuntu and FLOSS in general. Which reveals that he closley follows the world development of FLOSS as well as FLOSS pulse in Serbia. Without any doubt I suggest him as Ubuntu member. <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~promisman|upromis]]</nowiki>

Bojan has done an awesome job driving  the Ubuntu Serbia team. He has always been a pleasure to work with,  responsive, and performs great work. His personal example inspired all of us from Serbian LoCo I would glad to give him my vote for Ubuntu Member.<nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~dalibor|dalibor]]</nowiki>
