=== Summary ===
Make people more aware of backports, and make the backport request process less transparent

(SoftwareManager would cover some of the above)

=== Rationale ===
Backports is now official, and a lot of people use it. It would be nice to have a way for new users to know it's there and to be able to enable it in a similar way to enabling universe

=== Use cases ===

=== Scope ===

=== Design ===

=== Implementation ===
 
* Create Wiki Documentation to explain what backports is, and how to use it with emphasis on the differences between backports and extras.
* Fix update-manager so that it checks for backports updates
* Update synaptic so that it shows a dialogue similar to the "universe" dialog to warn about enabling backports

==== Code ====

    self.templates.append(SourceEntryTemplate("deb",
                                         "http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/",
                                          "breezy-backports",
                                          _("Ubuntu 5.10 backports"),
                                          ubuntu_comps))
