Please note that this is the working page of Breezy Goals as being targeted and worked on for the October 2005 Breezy Badger release. Please note that the Feature Freeze date for the Breezy release is 11 August 2005.

==== Nag/Brag/Star of the day(tm) ====
 
 1. Stars of the day fabbione, ogra, pitti  & kamion for having the first Completed goals! 
 2. '''Please keep the detail in the 'Notes' up to date. Use this to describe the current status of the item, and the next step/s to be taken. This MUST be done at least once per week from now on so that everybody knows where the goal is in its life cycle. Prefix the update with the date at the time of the update. Doing this will minimise you being nagged directly for info.
 3. Please let us know if you require assistance, or are looking for testers etc.
 4. See also the BreezyBounties Page for bounties available on Breezy. Check it out at:http://udu.wiki.ubuntu.com/BreezyBounties.  

-----
Note: If your name is listed as the lead in the list below - YOU are responsible for it! ;)
* While the lead is primarily responsible, the second and help/test people have indicated an interest in assisting with the topic, so please drawn on them as required.
* If there is a Breezy Goal with no owner assigned yet, please feel free to volunteer!
* IRC nicks have been used in this table
* The Top Priority table shows the MUST HAVE items, these will be given the most focus.
* Low priority goals are not being ignored, but these will not be driven as hard as the High and Medium priority items.

| chmj
| pitti
| dholbach, abarbaccia, Riddell
| (2005-06-30). This has been granted as a Google SoC Bounty to Paolo Durante  , pitti is the project assesor. See http://udu.wiki.ubuntu.com/BreezyBounties; (2005-07-14): snd_bt_sco tested and driver made its way to the kernel (2005-07-18): bluez-{utils,libs} new release tested, better dbus support (2005-07-19): nothing new from Paolo so far (2005-07-20): Paolo said he has started on the work, he takes long to reply back though (2005-08-19): SoC of code work has been defered for breezy+1, Paolo will continue until 1 Sept. bluez-{utils,libs} have been included in default install, main inclusion reports are on the wiki. Security review was need after a flaw was discovered, CAN released. Bluetooth HCID should work out of the box by default, there is only the lack of a UI interface. OpenSync is still far from usable. Expecting upstream to have a D-Bus daemon for for HCID(maybe Paolo's work improved), but that might only be included in breezy+1 (2005-08-22)  moved to Implemented, backend, security review and testing done. Lack of UI interface deferred to breezy+1. The libraries and utilities have been seeded and should work out of the box

(2005-08-01)  jbailey is waiting on a email back from a guy in Debian. Once he agrees to the gconf changes, jbailey just needs to apply them. Some of the pieces may need to get deferred, since the project grew to include all the non-installer bits. This doesn't block anyone else. Please send details of deferred peices to JaneW for recording.

| (2005-06-14) Stalled, need to resume work on this. (2005-08-01) Needs to get restarted. The problem is that moving the whole setup to being testable is a fundamental shift that we need to make so make sure that everything is testable at every stage. May not be completed for Breezy and may need to be deferred, but these were a Breezy requirement.(2005-08-22) Jbailey is working on these.

Most apps moved to Main, beagle remains.I would like to track beagle upstream until closer to release, rapid improvements in stability and performance. Almost done. (2005-07-29). (2005-09-06) mono is in main & all targetted apps are packaged and in universe, they need stabilization to move back to main. Novell is doing a ton of that work to get them in suse 10 but too late for breezy.Probably beagle, f-spot, and monodevelop are the hotest items to move to main, this is deferred to Breezy+1
