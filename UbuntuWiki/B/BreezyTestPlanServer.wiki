__TOC__

After performing a test, add your name or IRC nick, the CD build number (e.g., 20051011.1) and the test result (PASS/FAIL) to the appropriate cell in the table.  Any failures should be reported to `#ubuntu-devel` on FreeNode, where someone should be awake continuously from now until release. ;-)

The latest test images can be found at:
