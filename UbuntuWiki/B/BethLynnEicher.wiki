| Beth Lynn Eicher is a professional Linux System Administrator of over 10 years. With a passion for open source, Mrs. Eicher has organized dozens of events for Western PA Linux Users Group as well as being a key contributor to the Ohio LinuxFest. While overcome with the joy of community she experienced at South East LinuxFest, she made the bold claim that bug one will be resolved July 2011. She believes this change is possible through fostering current relationships by helping friends and family get started with Linux. During <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuOpenWeek/|OpenWeek]]</nowiki> on Friday November 6 at 19:00GMT (2PM EST), Mrs. Eicher will describe where Microsoft holds majority market share and what we, the Ubuntu community, can do about it.
