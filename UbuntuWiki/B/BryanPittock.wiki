__TOC__

I am interested in opensource O/S and applications.
By day I am a hardworking heavy truck equipment instalation tech, and by night I morph into geek providing refurbished systems and tech support at nominal cost or no charge in my community.
I am currently CompTIA A+ certified and would like to upgrade my education/certification if anyone has any relevant course material or sponsorship please contact me.
