=== Info ===

Hello world! I'm bluecat9 aka Justin Oros.

I first discovered Linux in the 90s from chatting with others on IRC and looking for something more than what DOS/Windows could offer. My first Linux distribution was RedHat 5.0 (before the days of Enterprise Linux) but I switched to Ubuntu in 2004 after reading about it on Digg (a tech news website similar to Reddit). 

I was drawn into Mark Shuttleworth's vision of creating an easy to use operating system for everyone that "just worked". If you used Linux before Ubuntu then you know it could take a bit of tweaking to get things working just right... especially regarding newer hardware and device drivers. Today, I remain passionate about Linux and Open-Source. 

Currently, I work with The University of Arizona as a SysAdmin where I utilize and support Linux systems and although I do use several distributions of Linux (including Arch btw- sorry, you know I had to), Debian/Ubuntu variants remain to be my favorite distros due to their stability, ease of use, and wonderfully supportive community.
