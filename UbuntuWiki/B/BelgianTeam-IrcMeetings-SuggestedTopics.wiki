__TOC__

Some proposed agenda-topics are below.
Some of them were already discussed but without decision.

* ICTday, Ubuntu in education, necessity of an Education-Team working on the issue "Ubuntu in education -world" ?

* What can we do to revive ubuntu-be ? Some thoughts and ideas:

*** Review/update of the promotion material (decoration for the booths, posters, flyers and printed material) - what do we need? Inflatable Tux? Rollups? booth material ...

 
** PierreBuyle
*** I propose to start defining the needs for promoting Ubuntu-be.org organized/endorsed events on the website as a blueprint. I will try to draft a first proposition before the meeting. I doubt I will be able to join the meeting. I can probably take the lead of the blueprint if needed/wanted. See https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu-belgium/+spec/website-events
*** Wiki cleaning: There is some old content on the wiki and it believe it discourage newcomers. The most obvious pages are BelgianTeam/TODO, BelgianTeam/People and this page (the agenda is full of already discussed items). The BelgianTeam is quite cluttered too.
