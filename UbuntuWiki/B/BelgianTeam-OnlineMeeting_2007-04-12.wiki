==== Brainstorming ====
Mark asks for ideas for making noise around the release of Ubuntu 7.04 on April 19.

* Peter Dedecker: rent the Atomium, use the balls for different Ubuntu editions (Ubuntu, Edubuntu, Kubuntu, ...)
* Mark Van den Borre: do something with an Atomium maquette on the Brussels market (objection by Jan Claeys: Atomium image is copyrighted)
* Benjamin Sion: send news to press (radio, papernews, tv, ...)
* Peter Dedecker: give Mannenken Pis an Ubuntu t-shirt
* Pieter Verledens: ask Google to put a custom logo on the release day (some Google employees do use Ubuntu on their desktop)
* Mark Van den Borre: a Microsoft - Ubuntu soccer match
* François Cauwe: make the biggest Ubuntu circle with persons on a famous place (lying on the ground?)
* Mark Van den Borre: Ubuntu circle with famous people
* Benjamin Sion: make an Ubuntu "crop circle", like at Waterloo last summer
* François Cauwe: go to the parliament and distribute flyers in the shape of hearts "to spread Ubuntu love"
* Mark Van den Borre: meet in Brussels for drinks, wear a feather (-> freedom) to distinguish ourselves from the crowd
* François Cauwe: give free beers, go around giving free hugs
* Benoît Plunus: promote Ubuntu with 2 or 3 demonstration PC's at a wine tasting organized by his parents
* Julien Detroz: hand out CD's at train stations
* François Cauwe: or just hand out flyers in all Belgian train stations
* Peter Dedecker: big paper train in a station with demonstration computer inside and motto "jump on the train of freedom" on the outside
* François Cauwe: motto "you can live without community, but the community cannot live without you"
* Mark Van den Borre: send open letter to political parties about their position towards ubuntu
* Benoît Plunus: asking Damien Van Achter (radio Pure FM) for a special "PureBlog" entirely about Ubuntu
* Alexandre Laurent: street warning sign A27 (wild animals crossing, representing a deer), maybe motto "watch out for the fawn"
* Benoît Plunus: make a logo out of it and place it on many websites, as teasing, and replace it on the 19th with Ubuntu logo and link to special page on Ubuntu-be.org
* Dirk Tas: start a 'poster' campaign in all trainstation and busstations
* Mark Van den Borre: do something with the animal itself, like go to a forest/park, honour the fawn, always makes for some good picture, go and have a picnic in a place where there are a lot of fawns?
* Dirk Tas: deer park called 'beisbroeck' near Brugge
* Alexandre Laurent: animal park in 'La Reid', but a bit far for everyone
* Jan Claeys: Plankendael (between Leuven and Mechelen), sort of zoo, with deer and gibbons (among other animals)
* Benjamin Sion: reminder about IndyMedia hosting an install party on April 22
* Mark Van den Borre: write a press release and spread it through Belga (donation, > 250€)
* Jan Claeys: social event (no laptops), maybe in Brugge

==== Actual Stuff ====
* Mark Van den Borre and Benjamin Sion will write a press release, Jan Claeys and Alexandre Laurent will proofread it. We can reuse text from ubuntu-marketing or Canonical, Benjamin Sion will check with them.

* Visit to animal park in La Reid on Sunday April 22, 2007 at 14.30. Mark Van den Borre will drive a minivan from Erpe-Mere (Aalst), along Brussels, Liège, and to La Reid. Other people interested: Alexandre Laurent (+ partner Bénédicte), Benoît Plunus. Benoît will create a page on the wiki. Alexandre will make an announcement on the mailing list.

* Benoît Plunus created a logo with the A27 street sign ("coming soon" with Ubuntu font) and uploaded it on his site: <nowiki>[[http://benoit.plunus.be/dotclear2/index.php?]]</nowiki>
