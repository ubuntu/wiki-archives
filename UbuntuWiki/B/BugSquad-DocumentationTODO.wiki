__TOC__

A list of things we need to document to make bug triaging easier (feel free to add any points):

* Better-explain conventions we use and how we use them, e.g. when to click + Upstream or + Distribution
* add blurb about closing bugs fixed in distro release A, but not in B (which is older), but won't get backported
* illuminate what can go into -security, -updates, backports
* explain how to decide "to whom assign a bug" (pointers sufficient)
