== Who I am ==
I am a high-school student greatly interested in Ubuntu and its development. I live in Saudi Arabia and I am 14 years old. I know C/C++, Python, PHP, Shell Script, VB, and some C# . I aim to become a ZCE (Zend Certified Engineer) for PHP one day.

== My Ubuntu story ==
I have used Ubuntu since late 2007, with the first version I touched being Gutsy. Have used all versions since then, and have been testing maverick since alpha 2. I got involved with Ubuntu development around 8 months ago.

=== My involvement ===
I am involved mainly in merging/syncing, fixing bugs (mainly papercuts) and upgrading desktop packages.

=== Examples of my work / Things I'm proud of ===
I have done the following merges:

Apart from Ubuntu, I am the upstream developer of <nowiki>[[https://edge.launchpad.net/gnome-media-player|GNOME Media Player]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[https://edge.launchpad.net/qstream|qstream]]</nowiki>.

=== Areas of work ===
I have worked on Universe and desktop packages. I have also fixed 14 papercuts in the maverick release itself.

== Plans for the future ==
=== General ===
I would work on SRUs, merge/sync more and more packages from Debian and help fix papercuts.
=== What I like least in Ubuntu ===
REVU seems to be an abandoned corner of Ubuntu development. Its very difficult to find people to review packages there. I would review many packages in REVU once I become MOTU.
----
== Comments ==
''If you'd like to comment, but are not the applicant or a sponsor, do it here. Don't forget to sign with `@``SIG``@`.''

=== Artur Rona ===
Bilal is promising contributor/developer. He rapidly learn to new things. His done work is amazing e.g. fixed papercuts. I think that this application has requested too quick. Bilal just improved his mistakes in packaging and there are no expierence. I would see his perfect work in next development cycle and then review application again. Also I suggest show work in SRU and security areas. <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:ari-tczew]]</nowiki>

=== أحمد المحمودي (Ahmed El-Mahmoudy) ===
==== General feedback ====
I have sponsored 10 uploads for Bilal, mostly merges and a couple of papercut fixes.
I see that the quality of his work is improving very well. When I had 
objections regarding his work, it was fixed in a timely manner.

==== Specific Experiences of working together ====
I've sponsored the following for Bilal:

|}

==== Areas of Improvement ====
LP 627994 was the only broken upload I seen from Bilal, it was due to a 
misleading changelog entry from the Debian package. Although I wouldn't put the 
whole blame on Bilal (nor myself since I uploaded it), the FTBFS wasn't clear 
because the different way that pbuilder & Launchpad builders work. It was a 
lesson for both of us not to fully trust changelog entries, and we have to 
inspect the changes by ourselves.

=== KenVanDine ===
==== General feedback ====
I have sponsored some (~7 or 8) papercut fixes from Bilal, all have been of high quality.  Never seeing any packaging related problems, and the patches solve the specified problem well.  His participation on the papercuts project has been valuable and much appreciated.

==== Specific Experiences of working together ====
As mentioned above, Bilal has submitted a number of papercut fixes that I have sponsored.  None of the changes were really significant or required much packaging changes, but his fix did solve the specified problem and was valuable.  I haven't reviewed any new packages or any significant packaging changes he has made, but I would trust his ability.

=== Benjamin Drung ===
==== General feedback ====
I have sponsored (at least) one sync request, one new package, and one upgrade. He responded quickly to improvement requests. The sync requests was good. I had only minor improvements for the new package/upgrade. I assume that Bilal gained more experience since I sponsored the new package/upgrade.

==== Specific Experiences of working together ====

* sync: https://launchpad.net/bugs/606610
* new package: https://launchpad.net/bugs/551702
* upgrade: https://launchpad.net/bugs/606870

==== Areas of Improvement ====
He could be pay more regards to lintian. Especially new packages should be totally lintian clean.

=== Stefano Rivera ===
==== General feedback ====

Bilal is active and technically competant. He was an early adopter of UDD for
merging from Debian, which persuaded me to write a review tool for these
merges. I've sponsored quite a few uploads for him (and endorsed his
contributing-developer application). I trust he'll make a good MOTU.

I am pleased with the number of syncs he's done.
We did have one issue with the skim merge below, but I think I was the one who
suggested a sync instead of a merge. I misread the merge request diff, suggested a sync
and then misread diffs again when uploading. (Grumble) Bilal was happy to help fix it up.

There are more areas of MOTU work to explore. At the moment FTBFS squashing is needed, and
SRUs are always needed.
