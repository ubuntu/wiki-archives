=== Purpose ===

The <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-beginners-launchpad |'''Launchpad Focus Group''']]</nowiki> exists to help BT members educate and participate in <nowiki>[[http://launchpad.net|Launchpad]]</nowiki>. Our focus groups goals are to educate the Ubuntu Community on <nowiki>[[http://launchpad.net|Launchpad]]</nowiki> and to use Launchpad's tools to contribute to Ubuntu and the community.  
<<BR>>

=== Joining the Focus Group ===

If you are interested in joining the Launchpad Focus Group you first need to be a member of the Ubuntu Beginners Team. If you are already a member please join the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-beginners-launchpad|Focus Group on Launchpad]]</nowiki> and add your Launchpad ID and skills to the <nowiki>[[BeginnersTeam-FocusGroups-Launchpad-Members|Members Skills]]</nowiki> page. If you are not a member of the Ubuntu Beginners Team, you will first need to become a member. You can find out more information <nowiki>[[BeginnersTeam|here]]</nowiki>.

New members of the Launchpad Focus Group are initially given three (3) months until their membership needs to be reviewed. At the end of the three (3) months members will have a better feel for what the Focus Group does and can then decide whether or not to resubmit their membership for approval.

==== Answers ====
Launchpad Answers is a community based answer tracker. It is a great place to ask questions about Launchpad projects (ex. Ubuntu, Inkscape) . Some of the strengths of Launchpad Answers over other support resources are:

* tracking user questions in a similar way to bug reports
* notifying volunteer support contacts of new questions 
* building a searchable knowledge base of good answers 
* allowing people to ask questions and offer support in different languages.
It also serves as a simple ticketing system for tracking Launchpad admin requests.

==== Bugs ====

The two most common uses of Launchpads Bug feature by Ubuntu users is to report bugs and to triage bugs. Reporting Bugs you experience in Ubuntu and Ubuntu programs gives you a voice in getting problems with your software fixed. With Open Source Software you can fix, complain about, and help resolve issues with the software.

==== Ubuntu package building and hosting ====
Using Launchpad, you can build and distribute packages for operating systems that use Debian-style packaging. Right now, Launchpad's packaging system (sometimes called Soyuz) supports the build and distribution of packages for Ubuntu. <nowiki>[[ https:--help.launchpad.net-Packaging | Learn More.]]</nowiki><<BR>>
