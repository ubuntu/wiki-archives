=== Report ===

Software Freedom Day 2010 has been celebrated in Ostend (public library Kris Lambert) on 18/09/2010.

The event was the result of the cooperation between Zandletters.be and Ubuntu-be (4 volunteers in the morning, 5 in the afternoon).

From 10.30 to 15.00 hr., 4 sessions were organized, including presentation of SFD and FOSS, and 3 workshops focused on Office, Internet and Multimedia applications.

Approximately 50 interested persons attended the event. Most of questions were about OpenOffice, compatibility with MS Office formats, Ubuntu, dual-boot and virtualization.

All conversations stressed the need for more information about FOSS and alternatives like OpenOffice and Ubuntu, but in a way that "normal" users can understand.

Software Freedom Day 2011 will be organized on 17/09/2011.
