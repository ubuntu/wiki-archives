'''Report'''

As usual, the stand was a success. Now a lot of people know about Linux and Ubuntu. They are interested in Linux but are afraid to change the OS itself. Unfortunately this year there weren't a lot of people. Maybe because it was the same day the wallonie's feast. A lot of people subscribe to the newsletter of differents LUG. We hope next time more people come to the dipro.
