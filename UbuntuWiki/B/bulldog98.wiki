=== About me ===
My name is Jonathan Kolberg. I’m studying computer sience since last Octobre.  In the IRC you’ll reach me as bulldog98 and I’ve got time so I’ll like to get poked ^^. If you want to visit my LP then go to <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~bulldog98]]</nowiki>

=== Translating ===

Before Lucid was released, the German Kubuntu Community (<nowiki>[[http://kubuntu-de.org]]</nowiki>) made an announce that there would be translators for the Documentation are needed, so I helped in my free time. Three or four days before Freeze we started with 0% on the Freeze day we had nearly 90%.

I’m also translating KDE to German to make KDE usable for every German not English Speaker.

=== KDE ===
I’m a KDE Developer and Translator (more Developer). I did svn2git conversion rules (not yet migrated) and I’m prepering a patch for kde-workspace, to let a ugly bug in German localized KDE logout dialog disapear. I also did some documentation stuff for rekonq.

=== Kubuntu ===

==== German Kubuntu Community ====

I am <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~kubuntu-de.org-members|Member]]</nowiki> of the <nowiki>[[http://kubuntu-de.org|German Kubuntu Community]]</nowiki>. I contributed to the planet, the wiki and I’m a Admin of the Forum.

I also promoted Kubuntu and KDE in general on the LinuxTag 2010 and 2011 (you can ask mcas or neversfelde for proof
).

==== Pakaging ====

I do Kubuntu ninja stuff for over a year now and I did nearly half of the secret 4.7.1 preperations. Still I need to learn somethings, but who want’s to stop learning :)

==== Fluffy ====

I was one of the first Fluffy users and I like it. (It even made an Windows user switch to Linux and stay there)

==== Promoting Kubuntu ====

I think I made the Sysadmin in my old school (long time Linuxuser) swich our school IT to Debian 6.Windows and Debian 4.0 were used for a long time.

I also try to convince my friends and parents and everyone I know to Kubuntu. And on the LinuxTag I did so, too.

=== IRC ===
You can find me in many channels on freenode.
