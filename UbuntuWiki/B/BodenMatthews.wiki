=== Contributions ===
I've ported Ubuntu 11.10 to run natively on the HP TouchPad, as well as submitting various bugs to be squashed.

=== Future Goals ===
I aspire to be a fast jet pilot in the RAAF, and a well-known developer. I also aim to get Ubuntu on the HP TouchPad totally stable and supported by Ubuntu's future releases.
