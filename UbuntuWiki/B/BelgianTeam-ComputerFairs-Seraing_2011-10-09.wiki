'''Report'''

The team was reinforced with 2 volunteers from the LUG-LiHuy.
The fair (brocante) was the first organized by this school.
A fairly limited public showed up, with some interested people asking for more explanation. When possible, people were oriented to local LUGs for more personalized support in the installation procedure.
Approximately 35 CD's 11.04 were distributed. 
Cooperation with volunteers from LUG was excellent.
