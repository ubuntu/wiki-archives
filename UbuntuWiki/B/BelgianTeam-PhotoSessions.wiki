__TOC__

Please add (a link to) your "Ubuntu lives in my city" photo session here. Some hints. 
* Make about 15 photos with the following elements:
** your face (preferred) or if you are very privacy minded, a stuffed penguin
** city name plates (city border, railway station)
** famous or special places in your city
** Ubuntu paraphernalia: posters, installation sets, ...
* The most common amateur photography error is not daring to take closeups; these are often best suited for press work
