'''Report'''

'' The event ''
This year as usual we had a lot of visitor. Technofutur TIC registered about 850 persons.

We had a big part of the event for free software with:

mozilla foundation
fsfe
educooo
olpc france

the advantage with all of that free softwaree association is that we redirected in generale people in the other booth.

A lot of people were interested by the free software and as usual Ubuntu is well know.

'' About the conference ''

I give a conference about Ubuntu and all around Ubuntu. The name of the conference:

Ubuntu, more than an OS

I was verry happy about the conference, the conference class was full, about 30 or 40 persons. And a lot of people were interested by the subject. 
I had a lot of question to answer.

The conference had to during 15 min and it takes 30 min with the questions.
