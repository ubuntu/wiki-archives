'''Report '''

*** The fair was put up at around 9AM, while the fair opened at 10. Ivo, Jurgen and Ward were there to assist me (Bram) to put up everything. We set the booth up like we did the last few times: set up in an L shape, so we have a corner where we can sit down to demonstrate a couple of things, without interrupting the flow of people attending the fair. The fair was relatively crowded, and we had a lot of visitors. Most of them already knew Ubuntu or were already working with some kind of Linux distro, mostly Ubuntu. We explained a couple of specific problems and answered a lot of questions e.g. concerning the new Unity desktop, the new layout, the roadmap and things to come. We had a total of 95 CD's pre-burned, which were all but a couple distributed. We burnt a couple of 64bit versions on request. Earnings for the day covered the booth price and the additional cd-r stack and paper covers bought at the fair and left €12 in change for the next fair in Antwerp. We didn't get the chance to take pictures or record a video... For next time we need to pay more attention to both the 64bit versions pre-burned, and the picture- and video-taking of the booth...
