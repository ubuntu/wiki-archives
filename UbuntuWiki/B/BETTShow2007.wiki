=== Edubuntu at the BETT Show 2007 ===
Thanks to the guys at OpenForumEurope, Edubuntu will be going to the BETT show in London in January 2007.  This is a great opportunity to show open source to the education sector in the UK and indeed Europe.  There is quite a lot of European participation at BETT.  This page is a chance for people to comment on ideas and methods that have worked at similar shows.  Let's really make Edubuntu shine here ;)
