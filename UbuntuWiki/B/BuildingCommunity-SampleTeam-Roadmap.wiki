== Roadmap ==

This page outlines the goals for the team. This should be a list of things the team wants to achieve, with details about each item and someone assigned to an item if a volunteer exists.

A table of roadmap items is a good way to structure this page:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| '''Item'''
| '''Description'''
| '''Assigned To'''
| '''Notes'''
| '''Status'''
|-
| Boogaloo
| We need to create a special boogaloo to do this item
| Unassigned
| This task will require x, y and z to be achieved before it can be completed.
| Not Done
|}
