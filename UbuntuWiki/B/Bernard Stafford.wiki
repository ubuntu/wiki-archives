__TOC__

I started off completely computer illiterate. Until I found my first copy of Ubuntu 7.04 Feisty Fawn.
That was the first OS I learned. After a long time I had found out that Ubuntu needed contributors
to help with Ubuntu. 

In 2019 I opened a Ubuntu-One login and started translating Afrikaans Language.
It was barely started as translations go. I have taken it upon my self to Translate the entire
Language Pack. I first thought their were lots of translators. None of them have any account activity
for years. Here I am self motivated and and dedicated through determination to accomplish this.

Ubuntu’ is a well-known phrase in South Africa. It speaks about the country’s moral ideals, the spirit of togetherness and our ability to work together. 
Essentially, ‘Ubuntu’ means “I am, because you are". "Humanity towards others" <-Describes Me
