__TOC__


This is a brief summary of bugs fixed between Ubuntu 18.04 and 18.04.1.  '''This summary covers only changes to packages in ''__main__'' and ''__restricted__'', which account for all packages in the officially-supported CD images; there are further changes to various packages in ''universe'' and ''multiverse''.'''  Some of these fixes were by Ubuntu developers directly, while others were by upstream developers and backported to Ubuntu.  For full details, see the individual package changelogs.

In addition to the bugs listed below, this update includes all security updates from the <nowiki>[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/releases/ubuntu-18.04-lts/|Ubuntu Security Notice list]]</nowiki> affecting Ubuntu 18.04 LTS that were released up to and including July 24, 2018.  The last update included was USN-3722-1 (ClamAV vulnerabilities).

=== Installation bug fixes ===

Updated CD images are provided with this release, including fixes for some installation bugs.  (Many installation problems are hardware-specific; for those, see "Hardware support bugs" below.)

|-
| ubiquity
| Bug:1751252
| misc.py: Restore the corrent euid in regain_privileges_save. Calling regain_privileges_save should restore the effective user-id to the one before the call  to drop_privileges_save. We need to call os.setresuid and os.setresgid twice to avoid permission issues when calling os.setgroups.

|-
| grub-installer
| Bug:1778848
| grub-installer: install grub-pc for EFI setups and make sure we're not purging it earlier in case it got installed. It's needed to make sure the right maintainer scripts are run and the ESP populated. Required as part of the dependency-chain switch for dual EFI/BIOS support.
|-
| partman-auto
| Bug:1766945
| recipes-amd64-efi/*: remove the restriction of the ESP partition that only allowed it being created when the partition table was GPT. This basically fixes cases where the ESP wasn't created if the previous installation was in BIOS legacy mode.

=== Upgrade bug fixes ===

These changes fix upgrade issues, smoothing the way for future upgrades to later releases of Ubuntu.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| update-notifier
| Bug:1768748
| Use a wrapper script of /bin/sh when calling check-new-release-gtk to workaround its requirement that the ppid not be 1.

| debian/control{,.in}: Make the transitional packages be Arch any and MA same, so upgrades work properly.
|-

| Only show apport UI if whoopsie is not in auto or never reporting mode.
|-
| unattended-upgrades
| Bug:1602536
| unattended-upgrades: fix Unlocked context manager. The Unlocked context manager did correctly unlock but did not reacquire the lock which means that in minimal-upgrade step mode it is possible to run apt code without a lock. If something else (like landscape, apt, synaptic, packagekit) locks the cache in the meantime this will work and u-u will get dpkg errors because dpkg will not be able to perform its operations. It is less of an issue in non-minimal mode, but even then the auto-remove step may fail in this way.
|-

| Skip starting init.d script in debhelper-generated postinst part
|-
| unattended-upgrades
| Bug:1781176
| Fixed is_pkgname_in_blacklist to be side-effect free.  Otherwise 'is_pkgname_in_blacklist' mutates the 'pkgs_kept_back' and 'unattended-upgrades' treats the package as a blacklisted candidate
|-

| Bug:1770082
| Generate udev rules files to rename devices Due to a systemd issue[1], using link files to rename interfaces doesn't work as expected. Link files will not rename an interface if it was already renamed, and interfaces are renamed in initrd, so set-name will often not work as expected when rebooting. However, rules files will cause a renaming, even if the interface has been renamed in initrd.
