__TOC__

Hi,
I'm an unix (Debian, Ubuntu and OpenBSD mostly) sysadmin, living in Paris, France.

My main interests and goals here are to help optimizing the default Ubuntu desktop in several areas :

* Memory footprint
* Power efficiency (on laptops, mobile devices, and even servers)
* Boot time
* Default security policies

My method will be to fill bugs (with patchs if possible) on the existing packages (rather than making new packages, or documentations etc.). I'll start working on power consumption.
