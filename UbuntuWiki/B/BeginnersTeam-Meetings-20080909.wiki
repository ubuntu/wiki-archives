=== Log ===
[Tue Sep  9 23:09:17 2008] <bodhi_zazen> First of all , welcome everyone, and welcome to the new ones as well.

[Tue Sep  9 23:09:50 2008] <bodhi_zazen> shall we hear from the focus groups first ?

[Tue Sep  9 23:10:04 2008] <PrivateVoid> +1

[Tue Sep  9 23:10:10 2008] <nhandler> 0

[Tue Sep  9 23:10:20 2008] <bodhi_zazen> How about starting with Privatevois then

[Tue Sep  9 23:10:32 2008] <bodhi_zazen> how is the padawan group coming ?

[Tue Sep  9 23:10:34 2008] <PrivateVoid> sure...

[Tue Sep  9 23:10:49 2008] <PrivateVoid> The Padawn group is coming along ok... I hope that everyone had time to read the page.

[Tue Sep  9 23:11:12 2008] <bodhi_zazen> +1 PrivateVoid

[Tue Sep  9 23:11:30 2008] <PrivateVoid> If people have comments in regards to the Purpose and Membership process I would like them to say that they have items to discuss

[Tue Sep  9 23:11:46 2008] <bodhi_zazen> Is the team , in general, happy with the recruitment process ?

[Tue Sep  9 23:11:52 2008] <drubin> can non members comment?

[Tue Sep  9 23:12:00 2008] <PrivateVoid> If no one has any issues then I would like to make this the 'official' process.

[Tue Sep  9 23:12:00 2008] <bodhi_zazen> yes drubin

[Tue Sep  9 23:12:05 2008] <bodhi_zazen> it is an open meeting

[Tue Sep  9 23:12:07 2008] <nhandler> I am currently happy with the process. We also seem to be getting a steady stream of new members

[Tue Sep  9 23:12:10 2008] <PrivateVoid> I would think non-members should be able to speak on this.

[Tue Sep  9 23:12:17 2008] <perlluver> +1 nhandler

[Tue Sep  9 23:12:26 2008] <Rocket2DMn> I think the new process has curbed the anarchy and confusion that existed before.

[Tue Sep  9 23:12:41 2008] <bodhi_zazen> anarchy ?

[Tue Sep  9 23:12:42 2008] <bodhi_zazen> lol

[Tue Sep  9 23:12:43 2008] <drubin> The proccess is a bit confusing, and the threads and wiki's are not 100% in sync and confuse some users

[Tue Sep  9 23:13:05 2008] <PrivateVoid> drubin -- if the wiki format is approved the forum thread will be updated

[Tue Sep  9 23:13:25 2008] <forestpixie> although it took only one question and I was ok

[Tue Sep  9 23:13:26 2008] <Rocket2DMn> it's a work in progres, we highly value input from you newcomers, you get to test the system

[Tue Sep  9 23:13:28 2008] <PrivateVoid> bodhi_zazen, already asked me to do that but I wanted to ensure that this process was good.

[Tue Sep  9 23:13:31 2008] <drubin> PrivateVoid, great. Can we maybe close the thread as well. As new users often try to post in there

[Tue Sep  9 23:13:58 2008] <PrivateVoid> drubin I can't but bodhi_zazen can make it sticky and freeze it

[Tue Sep  9 23:14:00 2008] <bodhi_zazen> drubin, there is a certain amount of responsibility new ones need to take re: asking questions / seeking help/clarification as well

[Tue Sep  9 23:14:17 2008] <forestpixie> +1

[Tue Sep  9 23:14:32 2008] <bodhi_zazen> I think the new process seems to be working well

[Tue Sep  9 23:14:51 2008] <bodhi_zazen> Again the idea is to welcome new members and help them orientate to the team

[Tue Sep  9 23:14:52 2008] <perlluver> +1 bodhi_zazen

[Tue Sep  9 23:15:16 2008] <bodhi_zazen> .vote "approve padawan process?

[Tue Sep  9 23:17:27 2008] <bodhi_zazen> I think the forums are going will

[Tue Sep  9 23:17:55 2008] <bodhi_zazen> put it in the BT section obviously

[Tue Sep  9 23:18:06 2008] <bodhi_zazen> Any issues with forums ?

[Tue Sep  9 23:18:35 2008] <bodhi_zazen> Thank you to every one who spends time on the forums, helping, it is appreciated :)

[Tue Sep  9 23:18:51 2008] <bodhi_zazen> ----

[Tue Sep  9 23:18:59 2008] <bodhi_zazen> Education => nhandler, ?

[Tue Sep  9 23:19:27 2008] <nhandler> I'm sorry to say that I haven't made much progress on it. I have been rather busy lately working on VoteBot and with school

[Tue Sep  9 23:19:40 2008] <bodhi_zazen> That is not a problem nhandler

[Tue Sep  9 23:19:52 2008] <nhandler> If anyone is interested in helping with the FG, I would be glad to have a co-leader again

[Tue Sep  9 23:19:57 2008] <bodhi_zazen> I think we have had a few sessions on IRC which went well

[Tue Sep  9 23:20:12 2008] <nhandler> I also have a few ideas for some future sessions

[Tue Sep  9 23:20:18 2008] <nhandler> I just need to get some people to give them

[Tue Sep  9 23:20:18 2008] <bodhi_zazen> I can host the logs on my server, be sure to send them to me

[Tue Sep  9 23:20:23 2008] <Old_Soldier> +1 python classes IIRC

[Tue Sep  9 23:20:37 2008] <Rocket2DMn> we have the wiki to host logs, too

[Tue Sep  9 23:20:37 2008] <bodhi_zazen> and also if there are any "hand outs"

[Tue Sep  9 23:20:59 2008] <bodhi_zazen> I am not sure if the wiki is the best place for the logs Rocket2DMn , or just post a link ...

[Tue Sep  9 23:21:10 2008] <Rocket2DMn> k, just an option

[Tue Sep  9 23:21:32 2008] <bodhi_zazen> -------

[Tue Sep  9 23:21:45 2008] <bodhi_zazen> vor tinivole => stalking

[Tue Sep  9 23:21:49 2008] <drubin> +1 for the tutorial. I think we can also try other lang's ie  Bash.. etc

[Tue Sep  9 23:21:50 2008] <bodhi_zazen> any issues ?

[Tue Sep  9 23:22:21 2008] <bodhi_zazen> ------

[Tue Sep  9 23:22:27 2008] <bodhi_zazen> wiki => Rocket2DMn

[Tue Sep  9 23:22:39 2008] <tinivole> bodhi_zazen, not that I'm aware of.

[Tue Sep  9 23:22:45 2008] <Rocket2DMn> Sure, on first note the official ubuntu doc team has been very active recently in working on upgrades - interface as well as content, so keep your eyes out for those soon.  Now, two things closer to home:

[Tue Sep  9 23:22:48 2008] <bodhi_zazen> wb Joeb454

[Tue Sep  9 23:22:54 2008] <bodhi_zazen> thanks tinivole

[Tue Sep  9 23:23:07 2008] <Rocket2DMn> 1) The "Summer of Documentation" is coming to an end soon, and I would like to get a bit more done on the wiki before then, including implementing the new Tag(s) feature as well as editing a few more pages.  Let me know if you're interested, there is a meeting one week from today (an hour later) but I'd like to start the work before then.  Please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Beginners/Team/FocusGroups/Wiki

[Tue Sep  9 23:23:13 2008] <Joeb454> ty bodhi_zazen

[Tue Sep  9 23:23:17 2008] <Joeb454> whereabouts are we on the meeting's?

[Tue Sep  9 23:23:31 2008] <Joeb454> nvm

[Tue Sep  9 23:23:35 2008] <Rocket2DMn> 2) I highly suggest that members of focus groups Subscribe to their team's wiki pages and that everybody subscribes to the BTMeetings page.  You must be logged into the wiki to do this, then you get email updates when pages are changed - it is your responsibility to stay up to date!

[Tue Sep  9 23:24:06 2008] <Rocket2DMn> /wiki fg

[Tue Sep  9 23:24:14 2008] <Joeb454> o/

[Tue Sep  9 23:24:19 2008] <Rocket2DMn> yeah Joeb454

[Tue Sep  9 23:24:20 2008] <nhandler> Rocket2DMn: Could we maybe get a list of important wiki pages to subscribe to? I know I am having a hard time keeping track of all the new pages

[Tue Sep  9 23:24:24 2008] <bodhi_zazen> The wiki is a large project, and any one willing to learn is encouraged to help out

[Tue Sep  9 23:24:37 2008] <perlluver> o/

[Tue Sep  9 23:24:38 2008] <bodhi_zazen> documenting for the wiki is a great way to learn Ubuntu as well

[Tue Sep  9 23:24:42 2008] <Rocket2DMn> For knowing what pages to subscribe to, talk to your FG team leader about which pages they use

[Tue Sep  9 23:24:45 2008] <bodhi_zazen> go Joeb454 ...

[Tue Sep  9 23:24:51 2008] <Joeb454> Rocket2DMn, would it be an idea to set up 1 email account to subscribe to it, which then forwards to all team members

[Tue Sep  9 23:25:05 2008] <Joeb454> or if a mailing list could do it, would that not be easier?

[Tue Sep  9 23:25:15 2008] <nhandler> Joeb454: I am trying to get us a team mailing list

[Tue Sep  9 23:25:16 2008] <Rocket2DMn> Joeb454, I think at one time there was a mailing list for the team, but it never got used

[Tue Sep  9 23:25:42 2008] <Joeb454> true, but for subscribing to the wiki, would it not come in useful?

[Tue Sep  9 23:25:48 2008] <Rocket2DMn> I am not opposed to the idea of a moderated mailing list, i wouldnt want to see chit chat on it though

[Tue Sep  9 23:25:49 2008] <nhandler> Joeb454: Jorge Castro said that we can get one, but a bug is preventing us from applying again. I will have to talk to him about that

[Tue Sep  9 23:25:51 2008] <bodhi_zazen> At one time we had (and still do) a mailing list on google, it is not used

[Tue Sep  9 23:26:04 2008] <bodhi_zazen> we have been trying to get a mailing list on ubunt forever

[Tue Sep  9 23:26:08 2008] <nhandler> bodhi_zazen: I think if we had one through LP, it would be used more

[Tue Sep  9 23:26:16 2008] <Rocket2DMn> jcastro is the man, he can make it happen

[Tue Sep  9 23:26:36 2008] <bodhi_zazen> => perlluver go

[Tue Sep  9 23:26:40 2008] <nhandler> After the meeting, I'll send him another email, and try to make the mailing list happen

[Tue Sep  9 23:26:48 2008] <perlluver> I am willing to help with the WIki, when I can

[Tue Sep  9 23:26:48 2008] <bodhi_zazen> thanks nhandler

[Tue Sep  9 23:27:02 2008] <Rocket2DMn> OK mailing list like a tentative plan, in the meantime, subscribe to pages!

[Tue Sep  9 23:27:03 2008] <bodhi_zazen> thanks perlluver , we will teach you how to help

[Tue Sep  9 23:27:08 2008] <perlluver> ty

[Tue Sep  9 23:27:13 2008] <Rocket2DMn> perlluver, ping me after the meeting and we'll chat

[Tue Sep  9 23:27:16 2008] <perlluver> ok

[Tue Sep  9 23:27:35 2008] <bodhi_zazen> Any other comments re: focus groups ?

[Tue Sep  9 23:27:50 2008] <bodhi_zazen> I know most people are interested in the forums, and that is fine

[Tue Sep  9 23:27:59 2008] <bodhi_zazen> forums are the primary focus of this team

[Tue Sep  9 23:28:25 2008] <bodhi_zazen> but if you are interested in doing more then forums, I would encourage / support that as well

[Tue Sep  9 23:28:44 2008] <Rocket2DMn> thats why we have focus groups

[Tue Sep  9 23:28:47 2008] <Old_Soldier> +1 the forums are a great place to start your contributions to the Ubuntu Community

[Tue Sep  9 23:28:57 2008] <bodhi_zazen> I also encourage the focus groups to recruit members as well, on LP, IRC, forums, whatever

[Tue Sep  9 23:29:06 2008] <seisen> that is where I started at, on the forums

[Tue Sep  9 23:29:08 2008] <drs305> Rocket2DMn: I'

[Tue Sep  9 23:29:22 2008] <perlluver> +1 for the forums

[Tue Sep  9 23:29:30 2008] <bodhi_zazen> OK, on to agenda ...

[Tue Sep  9 23:29:30 2008] <drs305> Rocket2DMn: I'd like to be in on perlluver and the wiki discussion

[Tue Sep  9 23:29:37 2008] <bodhi_zazen> we already heard from PrivateVoid

[Tue Sep  9 23:29:43 2008] <Rocket2DMn> ok, we'll talk after the meeting drs305

[Tue Sep  9 23:29:56 2008] <Rocket2DMn> heck we can hold a wiki fg meeting after this if it works

[Tue Sep  9 23:30:00 2008] <bodhi_zazen> Bods is not here, did he talk to anyone about his agenda item ?

[Tue Sep  9 23:30:26 2008] <bodhi_zazen> ok, moving on

[Tue Sep  9 23:30:32 2008] <bodhi_zazen> prayer b4 meeting ?

[Tue Sep  9 23:30:37 2008] <nhandler> Is alan here?

[Tue Sep  9 23:30:52 2008] <tinivole> ... :/

[Tue Sep  9 23:30:54 2008] <bodhi_zazen> I think this was discussed before and it was agreed => no prayer

[Tue Sep  9 23:30:54 2008] <nhandler> For anyone who does not know...

[Tue Sep  9 23:30:56 2008] <nhandler> !prayer

[Tue Sep  9 23:30:57 2008] <ubot3> Dear $DEITY, Give me strength to understand and work with users who question my logic, the rules, netiquette and common sense. Give me resilience to teach them the basics of Linux, Ubuntu, Community Guidelines and IRC. Allow me not to stray to nitpicking, argument, foul language or leisure op abuse. Deliver me my daily xkcd, User Friendly, LWN, /. and Planet Ubuntu, and guard over my encrypted drives. Let it be so.

[Tue Sep  9 23:31:02 2008] <tinivole> no prayer

[Tue Sep  9 23:31:05 2008] <bodhi_zazen> => tinivole go

[Tue Sep  9 23:31:30 2008] <Rocket2DMn> sure

[Tue Sep  9 23:31:40 2008] <nhandler> +1 for vote

[Tue Sep  9 23:31:44 2008] <Rocket2DMn> +1 to keep, -1 to get rid of prayer

[Tue Sep  9 23:31:52 2008] <bodhi_zazen> .vote "Shall we have prayer b4 or at meetings ?"

[Tue Sep  9 23:31:52 2008] <VoteBot> We Are Now Voting On: Shall we have prayer b4 or at meetings ?

[Tue Sep  9 23:31:52 2008] <VoteBot> Vote with +1, -1, or 0

[Tue Sep  9 23:31:52 2008] <VoteBot> You can also /msg VoteBot your vote

[Tue Sep  9 23:31:59 2008] <bodhi_zazen> -1

[Tue Sep  9 23:32:05 2008] <seisen> -1

[Tue Sep  9 23:32:06 2008] <tinivole> bodhi_zazen, I'd feel that I'd rather not have the "prayer". It's not needed, period

[Tue Sep  9 23:32:07 2008] <tinivole> -1

[Tue Sep  9 23:32:09 2008] <nhandler> -1

[Tue Sep  9 23:33:42 2008] <Joeb454> ty Rocket2DMn

[Tue Sep  9 23:33:43 2008] <Joeb454> :P

[Tue Sep  9 23:33:51 2008] <bodhi_zazen> Bods is not here

[Tue Sep  9 23:34:09 2008] <bodhi_zazen> In terms of FG meetings, I highly encourage using google cal

[Tue Sep  9 23:34:25 2008] <bodhi_zazen> meetings can be posted there and members can subacribe

[Tue Sep  9 23:34:29 2008] <nhandler> bodhi_zazen: Did you ever figure out how to allow other BT members to add events to the calendar?

[Tue Sep  9 23:34:36 2008] <bodhi_zazen> FG should post meeting on the wiki as well

[Tue Sep  9 23:34:48 2008] <bodhi_zazen> nhandler, yes, anyone who wants can add events

[Tue Sep  9 23:34:50 2008] <Rocket2DMn> bodhi_zazen, we need to integrate that better, i have wiki FG meetings posted, and i see normal meetings, not sure how many ppl see them tho

[Tue Sep  9 23:34:59 2008] <bodhi_zazen> they just need to go through me is all

[Tue Sep  9 23:35:20 2008] <bodhi_zazen> Rocket2DMn, on the gcal ?

[Tue Sep  9 23:35:26 2008] <Rocket2DMn> yes

[Tue Sep  9 23:36:05 2008] <bodhi_zazen> there is a group Ubuntu beginner wiki

[Tue Sep  9 23:36:13 2008] <bodhi_zazen> add meetings there

[Tue Sep  9 23:36:28 2008] <Joeb454> I have the normal meetings

[Tue Sep  9 23:36:35 2008] <bodhi_zazen> or we can collapse and use one calendar if we wish

[Tue Sep  9 23:36:46 2008] <Rocket2DMn> i think one calendar is sufficient bodhi_zazen

[Tue Sep  9 23:36:46 2008] <nhandler> +1 for 1 calendar

[Tue Sep  9 23:37:07 2008] <bodhi_zazen> OK, talk to me later and I will add whoever is needed to one gcal

[Tue Sep  9 23:37:10 2008] <Rocket2DMn> trying to get each member subscribed to each fg calendar they are part of just isnt gonna work

[Tue Sep  9 23:37:17 2008] <seisen> +1 one calander, keep it simple

[Tue Sep  9 23:37:24 2008] <bodhi_zazen> "Ubutnu Beginner Team"

[Tue Sep  9 23:37:35 2008] <Rocket2DMn> iirc, thats what i suggested when we first implemented gcal :)

[Tue Sep  9 23:37:39 2008] <bodhi_zazen> gcal is pretty simple seisen

[Tue Sep  9 23:37:50 2008] <bodhi_zazen> +1 Rocket2DMn

[Tue Sep  9 23:38:15 2008] <bodhi_zazen> That is all for the general agenda

[Tue Sep  9 23:38:24 2008] <bodhi_zazen> anyone have any additional items ?

[Tue Sep  9 23:38:31 2008] <nhandler> o/

[Tue Sep  9 23:38:34 2008] <bodhi_zazen> otherwise => vote on new members

[Tue Sep  9 23:38:37 2008] <bodhi_zazen> => nhandler go

[Tue Sep  9 23:38:53 2008] <nhandler> I had an idea for a way to attract new members to the various FGs

[Tue Sep  9 23:44:16 2008] <nhandler> We could have a day where we have all of the FG leaders prepare a list of easy tasks for new users

[Tue Sep  9 23:44:16 2008] <bodhi_zazen> good idea

[Tue Sep  9 23:44:16 2008] <nhandler> Then, we could have everyone interested in trying out a new FG try and do one of these tasks. They then could move and try another FG. It is pretty much a day of trying out all of the groups

[Tue Sep  9 23:44:16 2008] <nhandler> You just go from group to group until you find one you like

[Tue Sep  9 23:44:16 2008] <drs305> +1

[Tue Sep  9 23:44:16 2008] <seisen> sounds good, nhandler

[Tue Sep  9 23:44:16 2008] <bodhi_zazen> put the fg days on the BT gcal :)

[Tue Sep  9 23:44:16 2008] <bodhi_zazen> lol

[Tue Sep  9 23:44:16 2008] <Old_Soldier> I like the idea nate

[Tue Sep  9 23:44:16 2008] <nhandler> I also am looking for people to host Lessons about ways to contribute to ubuntu, and how to help users with ubuntu

[Tue Sep  9 23:44:16 2008] <Rocket2DMn> i wonder if that would work better if you say "today is Education day, learn what we do!"

[Tue Sep  9 23:44:16 2008] <Rocket2DMn> then a week or so later do "Security day!"

[Tue Sep  9 23:44:16 2008] <drubin> +1 for "Security day"

[Tue Sep  9 23:44:16 2008] <nhandler> I like that idea Rocket2DMn

[Tue Sep  9 23:44:16 2008] <bodhi_zazen> Rocket2DMn, I am going to make a post on the UF re : Intrusion detection

[Tue Sep  9 23:44:16 2008] <Rocket2DMn> cool, then team leads can schedule tho

[Tue Sep  9 23:44:16 2008] <nhandler> The last thing I wanted to ask was about removing inactive members from the team. It looks like we started the process by making the post on the BT forum, but we never followed up on it

[Tue Sep  9 23:44:16 2008] <Rocket2DMn> bodhi_zazen, i heard you mention that earlier, i look forward to reading it

[Tue Sep  9 23:44:16 2008] <bodhi_zazen> Anyone who needs to be added to the team gcal, PM me here with our gmail address ...

[Tue Sep  9 23:44:16 2008] <seisen> well we could do like they did with the Ubuntu Developer week: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDeveloperWeek

[Tue Sep  9 23:44:16 2008] <bodhi_zazen> Are we ready to vote on new members then ?

[Tue Sep  9 23:44:16 2008] <Rocket2DMn> nhandler, i think bodhi_zazen actually took care of that already

[Tue Sep  9 23:44:16 2008] <Rocket2DMn> nhandler, http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=469546

[Tue Sep  9 23:44:16 2008] <nhandler> Are we still planning on removing the inactive members?

[Tue Sep  9 23:44:16 2008] <bodhi_zazen> nhandler, the list is fairly up to date, no one has make me aware of any changes that need be changed

[Tue Sep  9 23:44:36 2008] <bodhi_zazen> I do not know if I have the energy to track all the comings and going more then every 6 months or so ...

[Tue Sep  9 23:44:56 2008] <Old_Soldier> why is nhandler listed as active and inactive?

[Tue Sep  9 23:45:07 2008] <Old_Soldier> Cheater is his forum name lol
