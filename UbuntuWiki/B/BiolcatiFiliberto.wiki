Dear Friends,

I've been using Ubuntu since 2008, when I used to use 'Intrepid Ibex' version 8.10.
I think that the Ubuntu Community is a great invention. Everyone can share free software!
It's the demonstration that when people work together the results are great!!
I'm studying PHP, C, Java languages!!
I would like to contribute to the community, even if it will be very small one.
I hope to learn something from this new experience. I think that in life you never finish to learn!!

Filiberto
