<pre>
[00:00] <bodhi_zazen> people ready for the BT meeting ?
[00:00] <nhandler> Yep
[00:00] <sblunix> aye
[00:00] <Silver-Fox-> Yes.
[00:00] <bodhi_zazen> #startmeeting
[00:00] <MootBot> Meeting started at 18:00. The chair is bodhi_zazen.
[00:00] <MootBot> Commands Available: [TOPIC], [IDEA], [ACTION], [AGREED], [LINK], [VOTE]
[00:00] <bodhi_zazen> Ah, perfect timing =)
[00:00] <bodhi_zazen> [LINK]https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BeginnersTeam/Meetings
[00:00] <MootBot> LINK received: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BeginnersTeam/Meetings
[00:00] <bodhi_zazen> Agenda # 1 Forums ?
[00:01] <bodhi_zazen> Bodsda: you here
[00:01] <sblunix> Forums sounds acceptable
[00:01] <bodhi_zazen> Alrighty then ...
[00:01] <ZachK_> meeting?
[00:02] <sblunix> Yes
=== WikiNinja is now known as starcraftman
[00:02] <bodhi_zazen> Bodsda approached me about the possibility for a team forums a few weeks ago
[00:02] <ZachK_> bodhi_zazen: ok
[00:02] <starcraftman> I r here, just munching pizza.
[00:02] <ZachK_> bodhi_zazen: is that a topic?
[00:02] <sblunix> bodhi_zazen, mmhhmmm
[00:02] <bodhi_zazen> as it so happened I was testing forums software anyways, so I set up a few test servers, which I think a few of you all looked at
[00:03] <sblunix> Weren't you having troubles?
[00:03] <bodhi_zazen> so, the question is, does the team wish to use a forums ?
[00:03] <sblunix> I vote yes.
[00:03] <ZachK_> save sblunix for last....yes FORUMS!!!!!!!!!!!!
[00:03] <sblunix> ZachK_, say what?
[00:03] <Silver-Fox-> I ask for what purpose.  Is it to replace the wiki?
[00:03] <bodhi_zazen> No real purpose =)
[00:04] <bodhi_zazen> The point would be:
[00:04] <sblunix> Silver-Fox-, The Wiki is more of an informational place. The forums would be a more solid communicational place other than IRC.
[00:04] <bodhi_zazen> 1. some people can learn sys admin as I will teach them
[00:04] <bodhi_zazen> 2. Would it improve communication ? Not everyone seems to prefer the mailing list(s)
[00:04] <sblunix> I believe it would, I prefer forums much over mailing lists...
[00:04] <bodhi_zazen> and a forums keeps topics / conversations nice and neat
[00:05] <Joeb454> I don't think I'd use it, personally
[00:05] <nhandler> Do we really need an entire forum for the team? We already have a section on ubuntuforums.org
[00:05] <Joeb454> I remember when we had the team forum on UF, that never really got used a whole lot
[00:05] <bodhi_zazen> +1 Joeb454
[00:05] <Silver-Fox-> Nobody uses the team group on ubuntuforums.org ,  will this be any different ?
[00:06]  * sblunix did not know about the team group on ubuntuforums.org
[00:06] <nhandler> I personally think we should make use of the mailing list and IRC channels instead of a separate forum
[00:06] <drs305> +1
[00:06] <Silver-Fox-> +1
[00:06] <PabloRubianes> +1
[00:07] <bodhi_zazen> do you all want to vote on this ?
[00:07] <sblunix> It doesn't seem many people use the mailing list either though, unless I'm just not part of it...
[00:07] <bodhi_zazen> or table the discussion ?
[00:07] <sblunix> table the discussion?
[00:07] <bodhi_zazen> no, mailing list is quiet
[00:07] <sblunix> bodhi_zazen, probably because I fail at mailing lists and don't know how to use them...
[00:07] <bodhi_zazen> table meaning, no forms , the end =)
[00:08] <nhandler> bodhi_zazen: Let's vote on this so we can have a clear decision.
[00:08] <bodhi_zazen> [VOTE] BT forums ?

[00:09] <sblunix> Oh well, idea tabled...
[00:09] <sblunix> 2nd order of business?
[00:09] <bodhi_zazen> Bodsda: is not here
[00:09] <bodhi_zazen> [TOPIC] -offtopic channel ?
[00:09] <MootBot> New Topic:  -offtopic channel ?
[00:09] <bodhi_zazen> is our whole channel not off topic ???
[00:10] <Joeb454> who suggested the channel?
[00:10] <Silver-Fox-> I don't understand the need for another off topic channel.
[00:10] <bodhi_zazen> anyone want to discuss this agenda item >
[00:10] <Joeb454> I think the current channel is fine
[00:10] <bodhi_zazen> I woudl say -1 , I think we have enough channels
[00:10] <sblunix> I thought #ubuntu-beginners-help was the channel to help beginners, and #ubuntu-beginners was the team's off-topic/communication channel
[00:10] <Silver-Fox-> +1 Joeb454
[00:10] <sblunix> +1 Joeb454 bodhi_zazen
[00:10] <PabloRubianes> +1
[00:10] <Buuntu1> bodhi_zazen, I agree, #ubuntu-beginners is already pretty off-topic, I don't see the need for a whole separate channel
[00:10] <bodhi_zazen> [VOTE] Add another channel ???
[00:10] <Joeb454> I think the current channel serves well as a general "chat" channel
[00:10] <MootBot> Please vote on:  Add another channel ???.
[00:10] <MootBot> Public votes can be registered by saying +1/-1/+0 in the channel, private votes by messaging the channel followed by +1/-1/+0  to MootBot

[00:11] <nhandler> -1
[00:11] <starcraftman> I dunno, was the point to make ubuntu-beginners into more serious support channel, scrap help and make new "hang out " channel.
[00:11] <MootBot> -1 received from Silver-Fox-. 0 for, 4 against. 0 have abstained. Count is now -4

[00:11] <starcraftman> Just saying.
[00:11] <bodhi_zazen> Any additional votes ?
[00:11] <bodhi_zazen> [ENDVOTE]
[00:11] <MootBot> Final result is 0 for, 7 against. 0 abstained. Total: -7
[00:11] <sblunix> Well, I think we should just emphasize #ubuntu-beginners-help as a help channel, and keep #ubuntu-beginners as our team channel
[00:11] <starcraftman> Also, don't go so fast, I'm munching food here, takes my hands to eat.
[00:11] <bodhi_zazen> Saj0577 is not here ...
[00:12] <bodhi_zazen> [TOPIC] Unified Newsletter (email) idea for the FGs.
[00:12] <MootBot> New Topic:  Unified Newsletter (email) idea for the FGs.
[00:12] <Buuntu1> ubuntu-beginners-help has been pretty inactive recently
[00:12] <bodhi_zazen> starcraftman: poke =)
=== keffie_jayx_ is now known as keffie_jayx
[00:12] <Silver-Fox-> Put the piza down starcraftman =]
[00:12] <starcraftman> bodhi_zazen, darn it I said slower!
[00:12] <sblunix> Newsletters for the Focus Groups?
[00:12] <ZachK_> +1
[00:12] <sblunix> Who would take the time to write them? Focus Group Heads?
[00:12] <stlsaint> sblunix: psst psst, we dont vote yet!! :D
[00:13] <bodhi_zazen> Shall we go to rocket and come back to you starcraftman ?
[00:13] <starcraftman> THe idea originally occured to me during the wiki fg meeting last week. Was just an idea to help promote events related to fgs. i.e. for wiki group to promote certain pages or maybe some sort of wiki related thing.
[00:13] <sblunix> stlsaint: psst, whoops, meh, I don't think anyone minds, my ideas are as good as anyones, I'm sure the team wouldn't mind my feedback
[00:13] <starcraftman> bodhi_zazen, nar, I'm noming in between typing.
[00:13] <ZachK_> sblunix: slow down buddy....
[00:14] <nhandler> One suggestion I had about this was that instead of having a separate newsletter, FGs could simply add news to the BT team report. That way, the team and the entire Ubuntu community would be able to see it
[00:14] <bodhi_zazen> How about if we roll the news letter idea into a team reports ?
[00:14] <sblunix> +1
[00:14] <bodhi_zazen> what nhandler said
[00:14] <Rocket2DMn> bodhi_zazen, please proceed, ill be back in a min
[00:15] <starcraftman> bodhi_zazen, sounds acceptable, I didn't really have a super strong opinion. Was just an idea.
[00:15] <starcraftman> Rocket2DMn, make it fast min, your up next and we moving at light speed.
[00:15] <ZachK_> sounds like an excellent idea...
[00:15] <bodhi_zazen> It is a good idea, I think beefing up the monthly report would suffice =)
[00:15] <sblunix> I think that adding FG sections to the BT is a super-great idea :)
[00:15] <nhandler> I would be glad to help any FG leader add their news to the Team Report if they want.
[00:16] <bodhi_zazen> nhandler: you ready ?
[00:16] <nhandler> Sure
[00:16] <bodhi_zazen> [TOPIC] Require Padawans to subscribe to mailing list
[00:16] <MootBot> New Topic:  Require Padawans to subscribe to mailing list
[00:16] <bodhi_zazen> can we require this ?
[00:16] <bodhi_zazen> or strongly suggest =)
[00:16] <sblunix> Well, are all members subscribed?
[00:16] <ZachK_> bodhi_zazen: strongly suggest
[00:16] <nhandler> As most of you know, we are currently moving from lists.launchpad.net to lists.ubuntu.com
[00:16] <starcraftman> I added it to the join us page, so it is maditory.
[00:16] <sblunix> I mean, as a Padawan I subscribed to the mailing lists...
[00:16] <Silver-Fox-> This is about non members sblunix,  the Padawan
[00:17] <nhandler> lists.ubuntu.com has the benefit of allowing any user to subscribe to the mailing list, something LP did not allow
[00:17] <ZachK_> If i may speak?
[00:17] <starcraftman> I took care to note list is for members and nonmembers.
[00:17] <nhandler> All BT members should be subscribed to the mailing list, and I will be hunting any non-subscribers down over the next few weeks ;)
[00:17] <sblunix> Silver-Fox-, Well, I'm saying that if non-members are required to subscribe to the mailing list, why are members allowed to choose if they will or won't subscribe to the mailing list?
[00:18] <nhandler> I would like to propose that as part of the new member process, masters ensure that their padawans subscribe to the mailing list.
[00:18] <ZachK_> +1 nhandler
[00:18] <nhandler> sblunix: All members should be subscribed.
[00:18] <PabloRubianes> +1
[00:18] <sblunix> +1 nhandler
[00:18] <sblunix> nhandler, Well, that was my question.
[00:18] <nhandler> I will be taking care of getting all members subscribed. It will just take some time
[00:18] <starcraftman> sblunix, why would people choose not to be on list, not like the list used to spy on people.
[00:19] <sblunix> starcraftman, That's not the point, I was asking if All members were required to subscribe... maybe some ppl just aren't cool...
[00:19] <nhandler> [LINK] https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-beginners
[00:19] <MootBot> LINK received:  https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-beginners
[00:19] <nhandler> You can subscribe to the mailing list at the link above
[00:20] <sblunix> so...
[00:20] <bodhi_zazen> I am very neutral on this topic, the mailing list is not very active and
[00:20]  * bodhi_zazen hates requirements =)
[00:20] <starcraftman> sblunix, Well I assumed new mail list subscription was completely manditory, I put it on the paddy join page. Simple enough to do. And who's not cool that uses linux, HUH?
[00:20] <ZachK_> +1 starcraftman
[00:20] <sblunix> +1
[00:20] <ZachK_> ok...next topic?
[00:20] <Joeb454> I think it would be nice if the padawans were on the list, so I'd say encourage padawans, and require members :)
[00:20] <bodhi_zazen> +1 Joeb454
[00:20] <sblunix> +1 Joeb454
[00:20] <dvz-> bodhi_zazen: i agree with bodhi_zazen ...if it's not very active...are we trying to bring forth more "clutter" of things because we think they _may_ be used?
[00:21] <nhandler> Joeb454: I think Padawans should be required to subscribe by the time they are nominated for membership
[00:21] <dvz-> and in which case, who does the work ultimately end up falling upon when we deem it "necessary" or "implement it"?
[00:21] <ZachK_> +1 Joeb454 and bodhi_zazen
[00:21] <starcraftman> I just wish list was a bit more active, you have point bodhi_zazen . Does feel too quiet. Like calm before an alien invasion.
[00:21] <sblunix> dvz-, I *will* use them, I mean... Since the forums are tabled, mailing lists will be a big part of how I communicate to the BT
[00:21] <Joeb454> nhandler: that sounds reasonable :)
[00:21] <bodhi_zazen> LOL starcraftman
[00:21] <sblunix> starcraftman, the alien invasion is soon
[00:21] <nhandler> And the list does have activity. People really should use it more for agenda item discussions
[00:21] <Joeb454> starcraftman: start an email then
[00:22] <ZachK_> I would use the list...i'm just unsure how to...
[00:22] <Joeb454> I've recently changed my list subscriptions to gmail so I can reply from my phone when I'm out :)
[00:22] <starcraftman> Joeb454, egad! Brilliant!
[00:22] <sblunix> ZachK_: same issue here, do I just send an e-mail to some sort of e-mail address?
[00:22] <Silver-Fox-> Correct
[00:22] <ZachK_> sblunix: i don't know....ask
[00:22] <sblunix> What's the beginners team mailing list e-mail address?

[00:23] <Joeb454> sblunix: ubuntu-beginners@lists.ubuntu.com is the address I believe
[00:23] <nhandler> Although I do think it would be easier to shift the requirement to being subscribed by the time you are nominated for membership ;)
[00:23] <bodhi_zazen> Rocket2DMn: your up =)
[00:23] <nhandler> Correct Joeb454
[00:23] <starcraftman> sblunix, and ZachK_ , please see the link nhandler provided up top. To use the list ya first get added, then send to > ubuntu-beginners@lists.ubuntu.com.  The list is open, so ya can send even without being subscirbed but then ya wouldn't get anything back.
[00:24] <Rocket2DMn> cool, sorry I'm late guys, I just walked in the door
[00:24] <Joeb454> nhandler: we can leave that down to the masters :)
[00:24] <starcraftman> Rocket2DMn, Your just on time, as always. Except I didn't say your name this time.
[00:24] <sblunix> starcraftman: I've already added myself
[00:24] <ZachK_> starcraftman: sent in request
[00:24] <nhandler> starcraftman: If you are not subscribed, I need to moderate the message firs t;)
[00:24] <Rocket2DMn> I just wanted to let the team know that starcraftman is now in charge of the Wiki FG, I stepped down a few weeks ago.

[00:45] <starcraftman> bodhi_zazen, wait up.
[00:45]  * sblunix actually has something
[00:45] <bodhi_zazen> OK, go starcraftman
[00:45] <bodhi_zazen> then sblunix
[00:45] <starcraftman> I r so slow today, or at least feel like it.
[00:45]  * bodhi_zazen drank too much coffee =)
[00:45] <ZachK_> speak sblunix
[00:45] <sblunix> Oh
[00:45] <sblunix> I go
[00:45] <sblunix> I thought it was starcraftman
[00:46] <bodhi_zazen> starcraftman: you done ?
[00:46] <bodhi_zazen> he is typing
[00:46] <bodhi_zazen> slowly
[00:46] <bodhi_zazen> go ahead sblunix
[00:46] <bodhi_zazen> if you can get a word in that is
[00:46] <bodhi_zazen> =)
[00:46] <ZachK_> sblunix:.......
[00:46] <sblunix> Ok
[00:46] <sblunix> Well
[00:46]  * bodhi_zazen listens to crickets chirping
[00:46] <sblunix> I just saw what Silver-Fox- just posted for the IRC FG
[00:47] <sblunix> some sort of "when are people available" poll
[00:47] <sblunix> Wouldn't that be a good idea for actual BT meetings too?
[00:47] <ZachK_> sblunix: yes and?
[00:47] <starcraftman> I wanted to note, the mentor list on > https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BeginnersTeam/FocusGroups/Padawan< has gotten a bit long. I think there's some inactive on there, and not all prolly wanna be mentors. It's not supposed to be a general members list at least imo. Just noting.
[00:47] <bodhi_zazen> yes, we did that a short time ago and are alternating times of the meeting bi-monthly
[00:48]  * Silver-Fox- is glad that was sorted =]
[00:48] <sblunix> starcraftman: Oh I thought the Master list was a general members list...
[00:48] <bodhi_zazen> sblunix: this time slot alt 2 hours earlier
[00:48] <sblunix> hmm
[00:48] <starcraftman> sblunix, well it's for paddys and mentors, but once ya make member ya should only be on it imo if ya wanna mentor.
[00:48] <ZachK_> sblunix: no...really i believe paultag has to approve
[00:49] <ZachK_> and bodhi_zazen usually gives his blessing first
[00:49] <sblunix> :) oh? Buddhists give blessings?
[00:50]  * Silver-Fox- makes note to actually ask
[00:50] <Silver-Fox-> =]
[00:50] <bodhi_zazen> Only the self depreciation ones sblunix
[00:50] <ZachK_> ok...is that it?
[00:50] <bodhi_zazen> Any other topics ?
