=== About Me ===

I'm currently a Systems Administrator, having been at various times a ...
* Research Chemist - CSIRO - plant cell wall structure
* Electronics Engineer - including custom designs, embedded micro controllers, small scale manufacture
* Electronics Retailer
* Water Distribution Officer (irrigation)
I have been associated with computers since about 1969, and still prefer to program in Assembler. I find Ubuntu and PCLinuxOS to be user friendly by way of both installation and useage.
These days I do quite a bit of small group tutoring in basic computing, mainly with the over 50s who have never even touched a PC before - this real M$ territory!

Hobbies include ...
* Croquet
* Motorcycling - restoration and riding
* Photography
* Orchids
