=== About Me ===

I started playing with Linux about 4 years ago when I  was dual-booting Mandrake and XP, then found Ubuntu right when Dapper came out and have been using Ubuntu on various machines, including a laptop and desktop at home, a virtual machine at work, and a server at work.

I've just made the switchover to running Ubuntu Gutsy full time on my laptop at work and I love it!

When not playing around with Ubuntu, I enjoy my job as a Network Engineer at Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital and spending time at home with my wife and son.

=== Georgia LoCo ===

In an effort to give something back to the Ubuntu community, I've joined the Georgia LoCo team.
