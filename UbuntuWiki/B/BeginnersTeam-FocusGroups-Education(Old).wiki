** Links to setup, maintenance and troubleshooting articles for Ubuntu
** Links to moderate to advanced topics such as bash scripting, compiling your own kernel and security
** Instructor lead courses utilizing the format of weekly assignments and posted material
** Live IRC sessions hosted by instructors
