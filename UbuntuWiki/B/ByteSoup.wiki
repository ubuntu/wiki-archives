=== About ByteSoup ===
Located in the Greater London area. Married, middle aged with 4 children. I tried Ubuntu around mid 2008 and stuck with it since then. I have had a few brief experiences with other Linux distros, but lack of experience and time meant I didnt get that far. Other operating systems used include variants of MS Windows, HPUX and Solaris Unix, and OS/2. Currently I work providing technical support for network management and provisioning software. 

=== Ubuntu and Me ===
I use Ubuntu daily, its on my work laptop (im lucky, my employer doesn't enforce what users choose for their OS, as long as we adhere to our corporate policies for security and such). I try to help out on the Ubuntu forums, mailing lists and launchpad questions when I can.
