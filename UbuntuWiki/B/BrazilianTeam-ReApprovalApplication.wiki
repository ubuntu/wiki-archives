The Ubuntu Brazilian team is growing faster year by year, and we are sure that we had everything to do with this increase. The number of Ubuntu Members approved by the council has increased too. It is the most important resource of information about Ubuntu in our native language. We are a very heterogeneous and varied group of people focused on spreading the free software philosophy, specially Ubuntu. We have a centralized community that works together in each segment and subteams trying to attend every state locally.

==== The Teams ====

 Whe have a centralized community that works together in each segment and subteams, which are the following ones:
 
* <nowiki>[[http://wiki.ubuntu-br.org/TimeDeDocumentacao|Documentation Team]]</nowiki> - This team was created one year ago with the proposal to create, translate, organize and maintain the documentation about Ubuntu in Brazilizan Portuguese. This work is being done by the <nowiki>[[http://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-br-doc|people]]</nowiki> of the team among the users and others contributors that are always invited to join us. Some results of this work can be found in the <nowiki>[[http://wiki.ubuntu-br.org/Documentacao|Brazilian Documentation page]]</nowiki>.
* <nowiki>[[http://wiki.ubuntu-br.org/TimeDeTraducao|Translation Team]]</nowiki> - The responsible to bring Ubuntu almost entirely translated in pt_BR, the default set of applications are > 90% translated as recently we did a cooperation with the Gnome-BR to get the Gnome Desktop completely translated to pt_BR directly in the upstream project, this one was coordenated by André Gondim with Fábio Nogueira and done by the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/people/ubuntu-l10n-pt-br|people]]</nowiki> of the team. In numbers we have 190 members in our [[https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-l10n-ptbr|translators list] and 10 members to review the translation.

==== Guiding and Educating Users ====
Trying to make the switch to Ubuntu even easier, we have worked hard to get the new users comfortable with their new community. The current http://www.ubuntu-br.org webpage was written thinking on usability and acessibility. To direct  new users where they should start, we have created the page <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu-br.org/comece|Start Here]]</nowiki> page.

==== Advocacy ====
With more than 30 columnists, the <nowiki>[[http://planet.ubuntu-br.org/|Planet Ubuntu Brazil]]</nowiki> brings the word of Ubuntu every single day to the Ubuntu Brazilian users, keeping them updated about the Ubuntu news, tips and tricks and promoting the OS to new users.

==== Support ====
To help users to get support and involved with Ubuntu, we offer the support and discussion forum. Our huge <nowiki>[[http://forum.ubuntu-br.org|portuguese forum]]</nowiki> is used by people from different countries where Portuguese is their main language, totalizing more than 12.000 registered users. Another form of support is the <nowiki>[[http://wiki.ubuntu-br.org/Listas|discussion lists]]</nowiki> freely available for the community. The major list is the <nowiki>[[http://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-br|ubuntu-br]]</nowiki>, where we have ''1014'' registered users.

==== Documentation ====
The main activities of the <nowiki>[[http://wiki.ubuntu-br.org/TimeDeDocumentacao|Brazilian Documentation Team]]</nowiki> are related with creating new documentation (tutorials, tips, how-to,...) in portuguese and organizing them in the <nowiki>[[http://wiki.ubuntu-br.org|Ubuntu Brazilian Wiki]]</nowiki>. The content is focused on new users, trying to make the instructions as easy to follow as possible once the number of new ubuntu users in Brazil is growing fast.
 
==== Translation ====

As you may know, the Translation's Team is responsible for delivering to the end user a system completely translated in their languages, and that's what the <nowiki>[[http://wiki.ubuntu-br.org/TimeDeTraducao|Ubuntu Brazilian Portuguese Translator's Team]]</nowiki> does. We always want more, in number and quality, translations to the end user. 

* We also encourage new users to participate actively in the community. For example, each team has a wikipage explaining how to help, contribute and join the team, guiding the user through the "easiest" and "quickest" route to contribute. See the <nowiki>[[http://wiki.ubuntu-br.org/TimeDeDocumentacao/ComoParticipar|Documentation Team How To Participate page]]</nowiki> and the <nowiki>[[http://wiki.ubuntu-br.org/TimeDeTraducao/ComoParticipar|Translation Team one]]</nowiki>, and also the <nowiki>[[http://wiki.ubuntu-br.org/ComoParticipar|general How to Participate]]</nowiki>.

=== Roadmap ===
==== What we plan to do ====

* Increase even more each team, bringing new people to help and spread the ubuntu philosophy
* Get Ubuntu 100% translated to PT-BR (we're on the way!)
* Make #ubuntu-br a reference in quality and the best help location for Ubuntu in Brazil.
* Create more documentation in time of new releases and tutorials extracted from the forum.
* Have a better communication and participation of the Regional Teams, integrating them.
