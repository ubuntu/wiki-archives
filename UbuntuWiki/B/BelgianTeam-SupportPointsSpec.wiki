=== Use cases ===

* Tom hears about Ubuntu and wants to try it. He learns about the existance of the ubuntu-be.org support network. He asks Wim, an ubuntu-XX.org volunteer from his neighbourhood, for an Ubuntu installation set and installation help for his laptop. Wim proposes him a date and time for a meeting. Tom agrees. They meet. Wim gives Tom gets an official installation CD, installation help and adequate answers to questions popped up. He is now a happy beginning Ubuntu user.

* Ibrahim is a happy Ubuntu user with a few months of experience. He likes it so much that he wants to tell other people about it. He goes to ubuntu-XX.org and reads about becoming a support point. Eventually, after having visited a local ubuntu event, he registers to become a support point for the next six months. At first, he decides to only distribute CD's and demonstrate ubuntu to people who explicitly ask for it through the web site to see how things go.
