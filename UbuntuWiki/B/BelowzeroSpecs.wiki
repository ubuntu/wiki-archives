__TOC__

With 186 specs and counting for the Ubuntu Below Zero conference, I needed a way to wrap my head around those that would be of direct importance to Edubuntu.  Here they are:

* https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+spec/thinclient-faster-startup (priority - high)
* https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+spec/thinclient-usplash (priority - medium)
* https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+spec/thinclient-sound (priority - medium)
* https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+spec/thinclient-local-devices (priority - medium)
* https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+spec/eclipse-in-main (priority - low)
* https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+spec/java-roadmap (priority - low)
