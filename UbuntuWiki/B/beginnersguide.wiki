Intention to create a "Beginners Guide" for New Users.  Comparison will be made with <nowiki>[[http://wiki.ubuntu.com/NewUserGuide]]</nowiki> to see if the two documents are done in the same spirit (with beginners specifically considered).

my first thought is that the term "beginner" is really a moving target.  As someone who has been involved with ubuntu for 2 years, i still consider myself a "beginner".  The other difficulty, is that time doesn't necessarily make an expert.  But, i will say that triaging a user's problem is really the best bet for getting them help.  Directing beginners to their local team (LoCo), and/or directing them to specialized channels wrt to their issue is probably one of the greatest things that can be done for beginners.
