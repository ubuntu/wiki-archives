=== About me ===

Hi, my name is Bernhard Essl and I've been using Ubuntu since 2005 (Hoary Hedgehog). What I like about Ubuntu is the mutual helpfulness, ubuntu users helping each other (not just experts helping beginners). I dedicate my spare time to helping ubuntu users and helping out in translations and bug reporting. During the day ﻿I work as programmer with a lot of open source programs and try to return much as I can. 

Feel free to contact me if you have questions or want to get in contact with me.

''Cheers Bernd''
