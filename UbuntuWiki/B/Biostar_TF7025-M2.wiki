__TOC__

This is an inexpensive (ca. $70) board based on the Nvidia MCP68 chip that is built with a budding hardware tinkerer in mind. It offers three levels of 'automatic' as well as manual overclocking options in BIOS. It also features one of the most modern integrated video chips (GeForce 7 series) with DVI display connection. 

The configuration was: Athlon 64 X2 3600+ with Zalman CNPS7500-CU LED cooler, 2x512 MB Corsair Value RAM (DDR2, dual channel), 40 GB Maxtor IDE HD and Matshita CD-ROM drive, powered by Sparkle 420 W PS.
I did not expect a miracle, and indeed the Ubuntu 7.10 Live CD hung mid-way with the standard option after a message appeared that the graphics chip was not recognized and manual configuration will be required. However, all went well with installation using the 'safe graphics' mode which ran at 1280x1024 until the Nvidia restricted driver was installed. After that, everything works as it should, including the DVI connection, sound, LAN and USB. Marvellous!

This is a sort of unexpected victory for Gutsy (IMHO anyway), since this board refuses to work with anything less than Windows 2000 with SP4!
