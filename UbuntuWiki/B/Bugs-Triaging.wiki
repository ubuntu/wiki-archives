__TOC__

Triaging is one of the most important parts of being a Bug Triager. This means that the bug report contains enough information for the developer to decide what's the problem. Especially when forwarding upstream it's important to have enough information so the developers upstream can look for the cause, especially since communicating goes a bit trickier with two bug tracking systems.
This page contains an overview of information of what developers would like you to include with the bug report.

Make sure this information is present in the bug report in all cases:
* Release(s) of Ubuntu affected by the bug
* Architecture(s) affected by the bug
* Version(s) of the package(s) affected by the bug
* Steps to reproduce the bug (and frequency of occurance: always, every 10th time, etc.)
