''Please check the status of this specification in Launchpad before editing it.  If it is Approved, contact the Assignee or another knowledgeable person before making changes.''

* '''Launchpad Entry''': https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu-belgium/+spec/promotional-materials/

=== Summary ===

The Belgium team need to fix the promotional material problem. This spec was already discussed on the ubuntu-be kickoff meeting: <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BelgianTeam/2008kickoff/promotional%20materials|meeting notes]]</nowiki>

=== Rationale ===

The Belgium team lacks promotional material, the only thing we have are the flyers, and some printed CD's.

=== Use Cases ===

* Schools would like to have a Ubuntu poster, but we can only send the to the official ubuntu.com shop.
* People on the fairs would like to have Ubuntu gadgets, they even want to pay for them.

=== Implementation ===

As discussed on the kickoff meeting, we would need two kind of items:
* Gadgets, that can make some money from to sponsor ubuntu-be.org
* Give away material, that we can give for free.

==== marketing material (Give away for free) ====
* small flyer (fast to read, like the current existing)
* multi-page fyers (at fairs...)
* posters <nowiki>[[File:poster-small.png]]</nowiki>
* stickers? (with maybe *only* the ubuntu logo, small (few cm))
* promotion-kit for hardware vendors

==== Gadget material (as some kind of money machine to pay for the marketing material) ====
* i.e. USB-sticks..?
* pencils...
* possible problem: selling this at fairs may result in loosing the 'non-profit-org'-subscription fee
* T-shirts: Pierre's brother's company could get some printed. Not limited to T-shirts, you can make more textile's like:
** cap-sweater...
* Other ideas:
** Ask money for computer-club-visits in name of ubuntu-be and the money goes to ubuntu-be
** Ask money at ubuntu-install-parties? (Now it is a free gift: keep that way?)
** Ask an organisation to put our name (ubuntu-be) as 'organising party' for a bingo-night (<ref: Rob)
