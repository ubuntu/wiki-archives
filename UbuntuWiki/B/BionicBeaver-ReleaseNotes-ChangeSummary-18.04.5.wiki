__TOC__


This is a brief summary of bugs fixed between Ubuntu 18.04.4 and 18.04.5.  '''This summary covers only changes to packages in ''__main__'' and ''__restricted__'', which account for all packages in the officially-supported CD images; there are further changes to various packages in ''universe'' and ''multiverse''.'''  Some of these fixes were by Ubuntu developers directly, while others were by upstream developers and backported to Ubuntu.  For full details, see the individual package changelogs.

In addition to the bugs listed below, this update includes all security updates from the <nowiki>[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/releases/ubuntu-18.04-lts/|Ubuntu Security Notice list]]</nowiki> affecting Ubuntu 18.04 LTS that were released up to and including August 6, 2020.  The last update included was USN-4453-1 (OpenJDK 8 vulnerabilities).

=== Installation bug fixes ===

Updated CD images are provided with this release, including fixes for some installation bugs.  (Many installation problems are hardware-specific; for those, see "Hardware support bugs" below.)

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| unattended-upgrades

|-

|-
| grub2
| Bug:1889556

|}

{| class="wikitable"

| apport

| apport/ui.py: Always allow users to use ubuntu-bug or apport-collect regardless of the Problem Reporting setting as they are manually invoked and not automatically generated like a crash report.
|-
| alsa-lib
| Bug:1868210
| d/p/0020-add-bios-version-for-looking-for-ucm.patch Add a new way to looking for the ucm by DMI bios_version. Without this patch, the alsa-lib looks for the ucm by cardlongname first, if it fails, then by the cardname. This has a problem at least on LENOVO machines, since a LENOVO model has the same audio design but it has hundreds of cardlongname, we need to create hundreds of folders for one model, that is unacceptable. LENOVO told us a LENOVO model has the unique biso_version, we could use it to find the ucm. After applying this patch, the alsa-lib looks for the ucm by cardlongname first, if it fails, it will use bios_version, if it also fails, it will fallback to cardname.
