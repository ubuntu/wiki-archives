21:3:57 <bodhi_zazen> Second

21:3:58 <Saj0577> the first sentence on home page converts me to it

21:4:33 <bodhi_zazen> back on topic

21:4:37 <bodhi_zazen> thank you everyone

21:4:46 <forestpixie> can I just say keep the superfluous chat down while the meeting is on please - finishes quicker :D

21:4:49 <Saj0577> il happily test it all day long good cause

21:4:52 <bodhi_zazen> I think the general behavior in this channel is much improved and I appreciate it

21:4:52 <Rocket2DMn> are we doing team meeting?

21:4:59 <bodhi_zazen> yep Rocket2DMn

21:4:59 <Silver_Fox_> Rocket2DMn, yes, here

21:5:0 <Zachk18> Rocket2DMn, yes

21:5:1 <forestpixie> yes

21:5:15 <Rocket2DMn> oh, sorry, why here?

21:5:22 <Zachk18> the cc kicked us out

21:5:27 <forestpixie> cc has the other channel

21:5:38 <JoshuaRL> Rocket2DMn: pleia2 is too mean to let us use the other channel

21:5:42 <pedro3005> the crowd control?

21:5:46 <bodhi_zazen> There are no issues on the agenda ....

21:5:52 <pleia2> JoshuaRL :P

21:5:59 <bodhi_zazen> so let me run through a few issues

21:6:8 <bodhi_zazen> First I would like meetings to be monthly

21:6:23 <bodhi_zazen> if there is a need or a ton of agenda items we can go bi-weekly

21:6:23 <Silver_Fox_> bodhi_zazen, Well,  general comment is that its busier than ever in this channel,  despite earlier time

21:6:35 <bodhi_zazen> +1 Silver_Fox_

21:6:35 <Silver_Fox_> thinks this is a good thing

21:6:48 <Rocket2DMn> had to leave work early to be here, won't always be able to make it

21:6:51 <swoody> +1 Silver_Fox_

21:7:4 <bodhi_zazen> Second, we need to keep the membership process alive, it looks as if it is going better now, thank you all

21:7:20 <forestpixie> Rocket2DMn: hopefully swapping times will be good for all

21:7:32 <bodhi_zazen> Third , we are alternating times to accommodate other time zones

21:7:40 <drubin> are we having the meeting?

21:7:45 <Saj0577> drubin: yes

21:7:46 <Silver_Fox_> drubin, Yes

21:7:47 <Zachk18> drubin, yes

21:7:55 <drubin> !agenda

21:7:55 <Votebot> Factoid agenda not found

21:8:12 <bodhi_zazen> meeting times will be listed in UTC, but I live in Montana, so, meeting times are affected by Daylight Savings , which is a source of confusion =)

21:8:32 <bodhi_zazen> questions re meeting times ?

21:8:34 <ibuclaw> drubin, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BeginnersTeam/Meetings

21:8:40 <forestpixie> we all get affected bodhi_zazen - even the UK

21:8:49 <Silver_Fox_> +1 forestpixie

21:9:1 <bodhi_zazen> some states *cough Arizona* do not do DST

21:9:6 <ibuclaw> forestpixie, except Argentina...

21:9:9 <bodhi_zazen> etc

21:9:11 <drubin> ibuclaw: hehe I was joking

21:9:13 <forestpixie> o/

21:9:22 <bodhi_zazen> yes forestpixie ?

21:9:33 <forestpixie> I hope that the experiment works - works at least for me

21:9:34 <drubin> times should always be in utc

21:9:42 <forestpixie> and we can carry on alternating

21:9:42 <Silver_Fox_> +1

21:9:49 <bodhi_zazen> My next announcement - I encouraged a new focus group

21:9:56 <Zachk18> awesome

21:10:12 <forestpixie> Zachk18: please ....

21:10:32 <ibuclaw> we were official  2 hours, 14 minutes, 14 seconds ago

21:10:42 <JoshuaRL> represent

21:10:47 <Rocket2DMn> word

21:10:54 <swoody> o/

21:11:3 <pedro3005> bodhi_zazen, what focus group?

21:11:4 <Rocket2DMn> What FG if I may be so bold?

21:11:6 <drubin> ibuclaw: ?

21:11:16 <bodhi_zazen> The Testimonials Team

21:11:24 <bodhi_zazen> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Forum/Spec/TestimonialTeam

21:11:32 <bodhi_zazen>  /join #ubuntu-testimonials

21:11:34 <forestpixie>  #ubuntu-testimonials

21:11:35 <ibuclaw> drubin, that is the time that forestpixie registered the channel

21:11:51 <bodhi_zazen> We shall see what happens, if they remain a FG or if they split

21:11:59 <forestpixie> o/

21:12:8 <bodhi_zazen> right now I am looking to see who is interested and what they suggest

21:12:16 <Rocket2DMn> ah, ok.  Just FYI, Dougie took a step back from Ubuntu contributions for awhile

21:12:22 <bodhi_zazen> I also suggest they then present their ideas to the FC

21:12:27 <DiegoTc> word

21:12:32 <swoody> as forestpixie knows, I was tossing around the idea of blending the TT with UAP to create a sort of 'Lost Souls' team to assist people who have tried to get help with Ubuntu, or are at the end of their rope with Ubuntu

21:12:48 <ibuclaw> swoody, UAP is covered by -help

21:12:50 <forestpixie> for the moment I would like to see it at least affiliated with us - gives a good and strong base to work from

21:12:51 <swoody> don't know if that would be an option, or if it would be useful or not

21:13:42 <JoshuaRL> o/

21:13:44 <ibuclaw> swoody, I once tried (unsuccessfully) to encourage it among the -help team. But evidently they are best working at their own devices.

21:14:0 <DiegoTc> i thinks its a great idea, it will be great if members of the UBT write their stories so everyone can read it and they can see you don't have to br a computer wizard for helping improve and spread ubuntu

21:14:1 <swoody> ibuclaw, ah, I see.

21:14:14 <bodhi_zazen> if comments are on topic, just toss them out =)

21:14:31 <bodhi_zazen> any other comments on the TT team ?

21:14:41 <JoshuaRL> does

21:14:47 <lukjad007> bodhi_zazen Wait, is this the meeting?

21:14:47 <pedro3005> swoody, lost souls sounds kind of... demonic-ish

21:14:47 <forestpixie> could write one of those DiegoTc 

21:15:2 <DiegoTc> i thinks its a great idea, it will be great if members of the UBT write their stories so everyone can read it and they can see you don't have to br a computer wizard for helping improve and spread ubuntu

21:15:4 <bodhi_zazen> along those lines , welcome to Ms_Angel_D , I think a few of you know (her ?) from the forums

21:15:10 <pedro3005> but cool FG nonetheless

21:15:10 <swoody> pedro3005, well I was just using that as an example of the idea I'm trying to convey

21:15:12 <Ms_Angel_D> hello everyone

21:15:21 <Rocket2DMn> hi there

21:15:26 <lukjad007> Hey Ms_Angel_D

21:15:29 <Ms_Angel_D> yes her would be correct bodhi_zazen

21:15:30 <swoody> hello again Ms_Angel_D :)

21:15:30 <DarkwingDuck> Hey Ms_Angel_D

21:15:35 <bodhi_zazen> Ms_Angel_D: is a padawan, under forestpixie

21:15:41 <ibuclaw> DiegoTc, its not really that. It's more about answering T&T threads.

21:15:43 <pedro3005> hi Ms_Angel_D

21:15:51 <forestpixie> is evil :D

21:15:55 <Ms_Angel_D> lol

21:15:57 <lukjad007> steals Ms_Angel_D from forestpixie

21:16:0 <ibuclaw> is eviler

21:16:0 <lukjad007> >:)

21:16:1 <bodhi_zazen> comments from the FG leads ?

21:16:4 <DarkwingDuck> forestpixie: play nice :P

21:16:4 <DiegoTc> ibuclaw: sorry didn't understand you

21:16:16 <Ms_Angel_D> silly lukjad007

21:16:18 <bodhi_zazen> Speaking of the FG leads ...

21:16:27 <Saj0577> is the clasrrom fg still going?

21:16:27 <JoshuaRL> i dont think that combining with UAP is a good idea. if you look at the wiki page for TT, under assumptions, there are four points.  the first one talks about the nature of a recognisable team with a name and how that would help to quell some flamebaiting and trolling that goes on there.  if we water that down with UAP it may not work well.

21:16:34 <bodhi_zazen> if you are interested in leading a FG please post to the mailing list for discussion

21:16:44 <bodhi_zazen> I think some of the FG leads would like to step down

21:16:50 <bodhi_zazen> due to time constraints

21:16:56 <Saj0577> whos lead of Education FG?

21:17:15 <bodhi_zazen> cprofit and vantrax

21:17:23 <forestpixie> that is not really one of ours anymore I think - more a bigger fish now

21:17:27 <pleia2> I think the education FG has mostly merged with ubuntu-classroom and ubuntu-learning

21:17:31 <bodhi_zazen> however they are involved with the UCLP and so replacing them makes sense

21:17:34 <swoody> JoshuaRL, that's very understandable. Again I was just tossing the idea out for discussion :)

21:17:49 <pleia2> but we do need more folks volunteering for -classroom sessions :)

21:17:57 <JoshuaRL> swoody: no sweat, just been thinking about it since i heard from you about it.  :p

21:18:4 <Silver_Fox_> I have an announcement for IRC team members

21:18:8 <forestpixie> the padawan and ed FG's need to be seperate

21:18:13 <bodhi_zazen> well, we can have an education FG interanlly if there is an interest in  teaching / learning

21:18:32 <bodhi_zazen> Silver_Fox_: your announcement =)

21:18:42 <Saj0577> well i was going to do some web based stuff installing and writing etc.

21:18:56 <Silver_Fox_> Next Meeting Wednesday 14th October at 23:00 UTC

21:18:58 <Saj0577> most the FG dont seem to function seperate to the whole gorup as a sub division as they should i think. just an opinion

21:19:31 <bodhi_zazen> well, the FG need to be strong

21:19:39 <bodhi_zazen> make it so Saj0577

21:19:43 <Silver_Fox_> is done with announcement

21:19:51 <bodhi_zazen> Any comments from any of the FG leads ?

21:19:51 <Saj0577> i will but i dont want to step on anybodies toes

21:20:0 <forestpixie> Silver_Fox_: is that the irc help team

21:20:3 <stlsaint> Silver_Fox_, i like wed meetings

21:20:5 <bodhi_zazen> Saj0577: volunteer to lead a FG then

21:20:10 <Silver_Fox_> forestpixie, Yes

21:20:11 <Rocket2DMn> o/

21:20:16 <bodhi_zazen> go Rocket2DMn

21:20:26 <Saj0577> Well if anyone wants to stand down from a FG i will happily fil there position so dont feel bad.

21:20:32 <Rocket2DMn> If anybody is interested in helping me lead the Wiki FG, let me know.  In time I will need to train a replacement
