=== About Me ===
California born, Tennessee native.  After having the pleasure of being raised among the creative arts in Chattanooga, I briefly attended school at Mercer University to join the cyber defense team and ACM programming team - the Binary Bears.  I had a walk-on role for one day on the NCAA Division one lacrosse team, technically making me an NCAA athlete.  In 2010, I moved to Chicago to work in the burgeoning tech and entertainment industries, and in 2013 I moved to New York to accomplish the same thing.  I have appeared, in minor roles, in several films and television shows.  Currently I'm an active duty guitarist in the United States Army band and I'm taking classes to eventually earn an ALB in computer science at the Extension School of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard University.  In spare time I'm struggling to write a post detection algorithm to assist in the modeling of circumbinary planets and do Kepler and the Planet Hunters a solid.  I also see very big things ahead for virtual reality. ;-)

==== Summary ====

Being active since the end of March, 2009, my main area of experience is with advocacy and support. As of 2013, Bugfixing and dogfooding Ubuntu Touch.  Working on radios for toroplus.  I own(ed) a computer store in Chattanooga, Tennessee that provides up-to-date Linux install cds and dvds.  As well, we sell Ubuntu beginner books and other such materials.  We also advocate Linux overall with the option to build your own computer with any operating system and window manager you prefer.  As far as we are aware, Radiated Computers is the only shop in town to work on out of date or Linux machines.  In addition, I moderate the U.S. Georgia LoCo Team forum on the Ubuntu Forums.  I also try my best to keep up with answering questions on the Ubuntu Forums and Launchpad, and occasionally on IRC.  I have also had minimal experience with translations, artwork, and tutorial writing.

===== Launchpad AnswerTracker/ Ubuntu Answers Team =====

In spare time I help out beginners by being an active member of the Ubuntu Answers Team.  Before joining, there is a requirement of 3000 Karma points solely earned in the answer tracker.  Through this functionality in Launchpad, I have helped many people with problems of varying difficulty, and in several languages.  I also usually refer them to the Ubuntu Forums, as in my opinion it is a much quicker and easier solution for finding answers to questions. <<BR>>
{{https://launchpad.net/@@/question}} <nowiki>[[https://answers.launchpad.net/~bryanlbasil|Questions answered by me]]</nowiki><<BR>> 

===== Ubuntu Forums =====
I have spent a very large amount of time in the "General Help" section, and the "Absolute Beginner Talk" section.  I have over 400 support posts, and over 100 off-topic posts. ;-)  I have posted many works of art, Ubuntu or otherwise, in its "Art and Design" subsection, and I have written various HowTos, posted in the "Tutorials and Tips" subsection.  <<BR>>

===== Georgia US LoCo =====

I am a proud member of the Georgia US LoCo.  The Georgia LoCo focuses upon increasing usage of Ubuntu and Linux in general in Georgia.  We host install fests and release parties, along with other gatherings.  

I am a moderator of the <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=210|LoCo's subsection]]</nowiki> on the Ubuntu Forums.  Also, I acted as event staff alongside other volunteers at <nowiki>[[http://atlantalinuxfest.org/|Atlanta Linux Fest]]</nowiki> 2009, and the UbuCon associated with it.

===== Launchpad Spanish Translations =====
While I have only done this occasionally, I try to translate as much as I can.  I have not done this recently. <<BR>>
{{https://launchpad.net/@@/translation}} <nowiki>[[https://translations.launchpad.net/~bryanlbasil|Applications and packages translated by me]]</nowiki>   

===== Ubuntu Marketing Team/SpreadUbuntu =====
This team is responsible for organizing and collecting ways to intelligently advocate Ubuntu, liaising with politicians, school board members, friends, and people passing by.  <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MarketingTeam/Projects/SpreadUbuntu|SpreadUbuntu]]</nowiki>  is a direct response to the Marketing Team that I am proud to be a part of.  It is all about advocacy, and with materials from the site, <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BslBryan#Radiated%20Computers|as well as my business]]</nowiki>, I have spread Ubuntu to thousands of people.<<BR>><<BR>>
In addition, I have uploaded materials to the <nowiki>[[http://spreadubuntu.neomenlo.org|official site]]</nowiki>, and in spare time help translate the project on Launchpad.  I am also trying desperately to get the domain name of "spreadubuntu.com" for the project, which currently redirects to Ubuntu's main website.

===== Extreme Tux Racer =====
While more a third-party job, I am an approved member of the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~etracer|Extreme Tux Racer]]</nowiki> developmental team.  I have extensively translated for the project, as well as testing each release of the game.  In theory, I should report and triage bugs, but I haven't had to do any of that so far. 

==== My HowTos/Ubuntu Documentation Team ====
I am a member of the Ubuntu Documentation Contributors Team.  This team is open to anybody, but I have written the following tutorials to give some meaning to being a part of it.  I plan on becoming a member of the Ubuntu Documentation Wiki Administrators as soon as I am more qualified to join, as I admire the Arch Linux wiki, and I'd like to help clean up and style the Ubuntu wiki in a similar manner. <<BR>>

==== Radiated Computers ====
<<BR>><<BR>>
In July of 2009, I made a decision with a friend to co-find <nowiki>[[http://www.radiatedcomputers.com/|Radiated Computers]]</nowiki>, a computer store that is open, user-oriented, and affordable.  The grand opening was on October 15, 2009, and we had a great turnout.  Radiated Computers is very Linux friendly, all new machines strongly suggested to run Ubuntu and other linux operating systems, and offering a backup of data and clean install of Ubuntu for free, though any other operating system choice is available.  

UPDATE: Radiated Computers is now closed. 
==== Roadmap ====
1. I plan to be a supporting contributor, developer, enthusiast, anything that helps Ubuntu to issue a bugfix for <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/1/+viewstatus|Bug #1]]</nowiki>, and realize proudly that I helped Ubuntu achieve that, along with millions of other people.<<BR>>

{{http://i61.photobucket.com/albums/h41/Adrenalinrush_2006/1206574733930851359Ryan_Taylor_Gree.png}}2. I am eager to find a way to spread Ubuntu, its philosophy, and Linux in general to the average consumer, transforming the meaning of PC from "Windows" to "Personal Computer." <<BR>>

{{http://i61.photobucket.com/albums/h41/Adrenalinrush_2006/1206574733930851359Ryan_Taylor_Gree.png}}3. Become an Ubuntu Member. <<BR>>
