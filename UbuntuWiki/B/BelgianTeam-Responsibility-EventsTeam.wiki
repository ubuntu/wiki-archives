=== Ubuntu Belgium Events Team ===

Ubuntu Belgium Events Team is for volunteers who want to help staging
events in Belgium, ranging from computer fair booths to release parties.

=== Task description ===

Ubuntu Belgium Events Team is:

1. Looking for opportunities to develop the promotion of Ubuntu (and open source),

2. Establishing and maintaining a calendar of future events and publish it in the wiki and website,

3. Taking initiative to set-up the organization of those activities/events and assist the booth- or event-core-teams preparing the events,

4. Reporting to the Ubuntu Belgian Team and Ubuntu-be community through  the  mailing list, IRC #ubuntu-be, or other communication channels.

The events-team should give the first impulse, and, for each activity/event, an ad-hoc core-team or booth-team should be in charge of the detailed organization and execution.
