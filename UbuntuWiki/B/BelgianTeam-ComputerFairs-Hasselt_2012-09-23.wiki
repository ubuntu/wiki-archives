'''Report'''

*** The Fair in Hasselt was a quiet exhibition. 
      There were not many new visitors, most visitors already know Ubuntu. 
      However, with the introduction of our ubuntu usb-stick we recieved a lot of interest for the usb-sticks. 

      We were a team of 4 enthusiastic promoters and have had a good time.
