Session 2

* Command line partitioning
* fstab
* chmod and chown

===== Notes =====

* We will be making use of a <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BeginnersTeam/FocusGroups/Education/STS|shared terminal ]]</nowiki> please make sure that you are connected before the session begins - the shared session will be set up approximately 30 minutes prior to the start time 1330UTC.

* It will be of some help if you visit this <nowiki>[[http://www.ss64.com/bash/chmod.html|chmod]]</nowiki> page and practise changing permissions to see the read, write and execute permissions change.

* If possible please look at the NTFS and FAT32 permissions section on this <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Fstab|fstab]]</nowiki> wiki page.

* The expected output from the shared terminal is shown below prior to the 7th February, please try and look through this prior to the session start to orientate yourself.

===== IRC Logs =====

<pre>
[07:Feb]:13:31<forestpixie>	Ok - then this is the fdisk/fstab/chmod and chown session
[07:Feb]:13:31<forestpixie>	This session Is moderated‭ – ‬this means that you won't be able to talk until you have been voiced,‭ ‬you can ‭ /msg PArtyBoi2 and he can voice you in turn
[07:Feb]:13:31*	forestpixie sets mode +m #ubuntu-classroom
[07:Feb]:13:32<forestpixie>	Right then, to the session proper‭ ‬-‭ ‬I intend to first work through using fdisk which is a command line partition tool and then to format our new partitions.
[07:Feb]:13:32<forestpixie>	We'll follow that with a question/answer session
[07:Feb]:13:32<forestpixie>	Then‭  ‬we will take a look at the fstab file,‭ ‬this file gives static information about partitions we wish to mount on boot
[07:Feb]:13:33<forestpixie>	We will be looking at our own fstab files in relation to the‭ ‬/‭ ‬and swap partitions and then write the lines needed to mount our new partitions‭ ‬,once again following that we will have a Q&A session‭ 
[07:Feb]:13:33<forestpixie>	The final part of the session will look at the chmod and chown commands,‭ ‬chmod can be used to change permissions on files,‭ ‬chown can be used to change file ownership.‭ 
[07:Feb]:13:35<forestpixie>	Ok - fdisk first, a little bit more here then we can look at the virtual terminal
[07:Feb]:13:36<forestpixie>	I am going to create the following partitions‭ ‬,‭ ‬2‭ ‬primaries,‭ ‬1‭ ‬extended and a logical inside it.
[07:Feb]:13:36<forestpixie>	You start fdisk with root rights on the device you wish to work with
[07:Feb]:13:36<forestpixie>	sudo fdisk‭ ‬/dev/sxy‭ – ‬the number of the drive can be found by using fdisk -l‭ – ‬check the virtual terminal
[07:Feb]:13:37<forestpixie>	You can see that it has listed 2 drives - we are going to use /dev/sdb‭ 
[07:Feb]:13:37<forestpixie>	so we will start fdisk on that drive
[07:Feb]:13:38<forestpixie>	m will givce you all the commands you can use here
[07:Feb]:13:38<forestpixie>	To create a new drive use‭ '‬n‭' ‬it then asks us what type of partition we want,‭ ‬I want the first partition to be a primary,‭ ‬so to create a primary we use‭ '‬p‭'
[07:Feb]:13:39<forestpixie>	Now we need to tell fdisk which partition we want to create,‭ ‬I want it to be number‭ 1
[07:Feb]:13:39<forestpixie>	I am going to use cylinders to set up the sizes of the partitions‭ – ‬we can see from the previous fdisk output that the whole drive is 652 cyclinders in size. I used the default setting for the first cylinder of this partition
[07:Feb]:13:39<forestpixie>	Now I need to specify where the partition ends,‭ ‬for the first partition I use‭ ‬200‭ ‬as I want the partition to be‭  ‬that many cylinders in size
[07:Feb]:13:39<forestpixie>	I could if I wanted create the partition using a number to give it a size,‭ ‬you use G for Gb,‭ ‬M for Mb or K for Kb
[07:Feb]:13:40<forestpixie>	Finally I need to tell fdisk to complete the operation and write the new partition table,‭ ‬to do this use‭  w
[07:Feb]:13:40<forestpixie>	If I use fdisk‭ ‬-l it should now show me my new partition,
[07:Feb]:13:41<forestpixie>	Ok I will now proceed to create the remaining partitions.‭ ‬First‭ ‬1‭ ‬more primary and then the extended with it's associated logical,‭ ‬this time I will make all the new partitions and then write the table at the end
[07:Feb]:13:42<forestpixie>	Now that I have an extended that choice is no longer possible,‭ ‬so now we can only create primaries or logical as you will see,‭ ‬further once fdisk knows I wish to create a logical it will only allow me to create it within the extended partition
[07:Feb]:13:44<forestpixie>	Ok so we now have our partitions created - at the moment they are all needing filesystems, before we do that I'll stop and you can tell me if I was to slow or fast :)
[07:Feb]:13:44*	forestpixie sets mode -m #ubuntu-classroom
[07:Feb]:13:45<forestpixie>	if you have any questions - ask now
[07:Feb]:13:45*	forestpixie sets mode +m #ubuntu-classroom
[07:Feb]:13:46<forestpixie>	on to creating the filesystems then - so back and forth between here and the terminal
[07:Feb]:13:46<forestpixie>	We can use the mkfs,‭ ‬mkdosfs and mkntfs‭  ‬commands here to accomplish this‭ ‬,‭ ‬the syntax to use this command is similar for all‭ ‬3
[07:Feb]:13:46<forestpixie>	sudo mkfs‭ ‬-t filetype‭ ‬/dev/sdxy , So the commands we will need to run in our vt are
[07:Feb]:13:48<forestpixie>	Ok we now have our created our new partitions and formatted them.
[07:Feb]:13:49<forestpixie>	As ther are no questions I'll carry on with fstab
[07:Feb]:13:50<forestpixie>	If you run cat /etc/fstab in a normal terminal you will see this at the top
[07:Feb]:13:50<forestpixie>	‭  <file system> <mount point>   <type>  <options>       <dump>  <pass>
[07:Feb]:13:51<forestpixie>	This is part of my fstab relating to my‭ ‬/‭ ‬partition‭ 
[07:Feb]:13:51*	forestpixie gives voice to PartyBoi2
[07:Feb]:13:51<forestpixie>	UUID‭=‬9d44e64b-0c3f-4376-93f5-7e0a4bc9afac‭ ‬/‭ ‬ext3‭ ‬relatime,errors=remount-ro‭  ‬0‭ ‬1‭ 
[07:Feb]:13:51<forestpixie>	OK,‭ ‬so now lets have a look at the fstab line in some more detail and then finally we can look at creating a new line.‭ 
[07:Feb]:13:52<forestpixie>	The first part  to the UUID,‭ ‬you can if you wish use the device name instead of UUID‭ 
[07:Feb]:13:52<forestpixie>	to do so I would replace it with‭ ‬/dev/sda2‭ ‬this would make my fstab line read so‭ 
[07:Feb]:13:52<forestpixie>	/dev/sda2‎ ‏/‎ ‏ext3‭ ‬relatime,errors=remount-ro‭ ‬0‭ ‬1‭ 
[07:Feb]:13:52<forestpixie>	The advantage of using the UUID lies in it not changing unless a change is made to the partition itself,‭ ‬creating,‭ ‬removing or resizing other partitions doesn't affect the UUID of unaffected partitions.‭ 
[07:Feb]:13:52<forestpixie>	The next part of the line‭ ‬-‭ ‬/‭ ‬tells the system where we want our partition to mount,‭ ‬this partition is my install so I want it mounting as root‭ 
[07:Feb]:13:53<forestpixie>	Following the mount point is the filesystem type‭ ‬-‭ ‬mine is ext3,‭ ‬if you have a default installation yours should be the same,‭ ‬if you have any ntfs drives mounting then that would read ntfs or maybe ntfs-3g
[07:Feb]:13:53<forestpixie>	After the filesystem,‭ ‬any options are indicated,‭ ‬here relatime is the first option followed by the errors=remount-ro option‭ ‬-‭ ‬this second option is the one which will cause the system to remount the partition as read only
[07:Feb]:13:53<forestpixie>	The next section is set as‭ ‬0‭ ‬-‭ ‬this is the dump option and relates to whether the filesystem is backed up by dump,‭ ‬0,‭ ‬the default is no.
[07:Feb]:13:54<forestpixie>	Finally we have the pass section‭ ‬-‭ ‬this is set to‭ ‬1‭ ‬-‭ ‬this controls the order in which a filesystem is checked by fsck,‭ ‬a‭ ‬1‭ ‬means that the partition is checked first,‭ ‬a‭ ‬0‭ ‬would stop the check and a‭ ‬2‭ ‬would mean it was checked last.‭ 
[07:Feb]:13:55<forestpixie>	If there any latecomers can they /msg PartyBoi2 with questions please :)
[07:Feb]:13:55<forestpixie>	Before we can actually mount any new partitions,‭ ‬we need to have somewhere to mount it,‭ ‬the mountpoint,‭ ‬so we do that by making a folder.
[07:Feb]:13:56<forestpixie>	I tend to use‭ ‬/mnt for my mounts‭ – ‬if you want the partition to be visible on the desktop then create your folder in‭ ‬/media instead
[07:Feb]:13:56<forestpixie>	To do that we would use the mkdir command like so
[07:Feb]:13:56<forestpixie>	sudo mkdir /mnt/foldername
[07:Feb]:13:56<forestpixie>	So to allow our new partitions to mount correctly I need to create their mountpoints - one for each partition we have created
[07:Feb]:13:56<forestpixie>	which I need to do no win the shared terminal
[07:Feb]:13:58<forestpixie>	So now we have the new folders in‭ ‬/mnt to use.
[07:Feb]:13:58*	forestpixie sets mode -m #ubuntu-classroom
[07:Feb]:13:58<forestpixie>	db1 - you have a question?
[07:Feb]:13:58*	PartyBoi2 gives voice to d1b
[07:Feb]:13:59<d1b>	yes what happens if you rename a luks lvm volume -> will it continue to work if you use the uuid in /etc/fstab or do you need to update initrd ?
[07:Feb]:14:00<forestpixie>	I don't know the answer to that - I've never used them
[07:Feb]:14:00<forestpixie>	if anyone else does I think you should be able to talk until I set the mode again 
[07:Feb]:14:02<forestpixie>	so we've made our folders in /mnt now we need ot add them to fstab
[07:Feb]:14:02<forestpixie>	We are going to be editing the file with a terminal based text editor - it's useful to know your way around at least one - if you ever need to edit a file from the recovery menu then I'm afraid that a GUI editor like gedit, kate or mousepad will be of no use.
[07:Feb]:14:03<forestpixie>	so first we give tell it which partition we are mounting
[07:Feb]:14:03<forestpixie>	which is /dev/sdb1‭ 
[07:Feb]:14:03<forestpixie>	Next we have to tell it our new mountpoint
[07:Feb]:14:04*	PartyBoi2 removes voice from d1b
[07:Feb]:14:04<forestpixie>	‭/dev/sdb1  /mnt/ext3
[07:Feb]:14:04<forestpixie>	Next comes the filetype
[07:Feb]:14:04<forestpixie>	‭	/dev/sdb1   /mnt/ext3   ext3
[07:Feb]:14:04<forestpixie>	Next come any options you wish to pass‭ – ‬I add user here
[07:Feb]:14:05<forestpixie>	Finally we come to the dump and pass options,‭ ‬use the default‭ ‬0‭ ‬for the dump and‭ ‬2‭ ‬for the pass option,‭ ‬it is suggested that you allow fsck to check the drive,‭ ‬but if you wished it not to then you would set the pass option to‭ ‬0 - you can change the frequency that fsck checks a drive
[07:Feb]:14:05<forestpixie>	Now I shall add the lines for our other‭ ‬2‭ ‬partitions,‭ ‬the ntfs and fat32
[07:Feb]:14:06<forestpixie>	So that is the data entered into fstab,‭ ‬you would now need to save the file
[07:Feb]:14:06<forestpixie>	I would now mount to check that the partitions have mounted without any problems
[07:Feb]:14:06<forestpixie>	Assuming that there is no output on the screen then the partition has mounted.‭ ‬You can check to see with a couple of commands,‭ ‬but df is a bit easier to scan
[07:Feb]:14:07<forestpixie>	ok - it's possible that there is a apparmor operating on the terminal - I've done this ocne earlier and it worked without issue
[07:Feb]:14:09<forestpixie>	ok - we have a small problem in the shared terminal :(
[07:Feb]:14:09<forestpixie>	we can stop for a while for any questions - we are unmoderated so I think you can talk 
[07:Feb]:14:10<forestpixie>	If you have questions ?
[07:Feb]:14:10<unutbu>	could you cat /etc/fstab please?
[07:Feb]:14:10<forestpixie>	yep
[07:Feb]:14:10<unutbu>	There is a space before dev/sdb2
[07:Feb]:14:11<unutbu>	huh, weird
[07:Feb]:14:12<forestpixie>	so there was - pasting from abiword doesn't work as well as openoffice :)
[07:Feb]:14:12<forestpixie>	the vm is running on jaunty, I think there were some issues when the vm was set up - but he's not about so I can't ask
[07:Feb]:14:13<forestpixie>	I ran this previously and the log from the session is on the wiki page
[07:Feb]:14:13<unutbu>	Maybe there is some invisible character that came with the pasting?
[07:Feb]:14:14<forestpixie>	possibly I can try doing ti long hand :)
[07:Feb]:14:18<forestpixie>	thanks you unutbu :)
[07:Feb]:14:18<unutbu>	cool
[07:Feb]:14:19<forestpixie>	ok then we can move on if there are no questions :)
[07:Feb]:14:19<unutbu>	Could you do sudo fdisk -l one more time?
[07:Feb]:14:19<forestpixie>	first we can look at chown - changing ownership of files or folders
[07:Feb]:14:20<forestpixie>	I think that is the problem we had from the beginning with the vm unutbu 
[07:Feb]:14:20<unutbu>	ok
[07:Feb]:14:21<forestpixie>	I have no idea why it shows them all as linux - nor did bodhi
[07:Feb]:14:21<unutbu>	when you use fdisk, you can use a command to change the partition type
[07:Feb]:14:21<unutbu>	it is interesting that you can proceed without doing so
[07:Feb]:14:22<unutbu>	within fdisk the command is 't'
[07:Feb]:14:22<forestpixie>	to be honest I've only used it a few times in anger - and I rarely have anything to do with win filesystems anymore
[07:Feb]:14:22<unutbu>	you can still do it; even on a partition with a filesystem
[07:Feb]:14:22<unutbu>	:) lol
[07:Feb]:14:23<forestpixie>	I can have a look later if you want 
[07:Feb]:14:23<unutbu>	ok
[07:Feb]:14:23<forestpixie>	Nearly finished now 
[07:Feb]:14:23<forestpixie>	There are‭ ‬4‭ ‬different permutations available for the owner and group changes
[07:Feb]:14:24<forestpixie>	so we'll make a folder in our /etx3 partition and change the owner and group to see the changes
[07:Feb]:14:25<forestpixie>	so we can change the fodler with chown
[07:Feb]:14:28<forestpixie>	so chown can change the owner or group for a folder or file
[07:Feb]:14:28<forestpixie>	chmod will change the permissions for files or folders 
[07:Feb]:14:29<forestpixie>	the command is used like
[07:Feb]:14:29<forestpixie>	chmod 000 /path/to/file
[07:Feb]:14:29<forestpixie>	the numbers are made from 4, 2 and 1 - giving a combination of read, write and execute
[07:Feb]:14:30<forestpixie>	ls -al will show the current permissions - the d simply denoting that it is a folder rather than a file
[07:Feb]:14:31<forestpixie>	at the moment the folder temp has 755 permissions fro group and others - owner has read,write and execute
[07:Feb]:14:31<forestpixie>	so in the shared session I can change them
[07:Feb]:14:33<forestpixie>	so once we know the chmod and chown commands we can change the owner and permissions of any file or folder
[07:Feb]:14:33<forestpixie>	ok - thanks for coming along - that's it for the time being
</pre>
