Hi, I'm Bjørn Ove Grøtan - also known as Gagatan on freenode/ircnet

I'm currently trying to become a MOTU in order to properly support my current and upcoming packages.

I've been packaging Luma for a while now, and have a couple of new packages ready for sponsorship.
I have yet to apply for DD-status.

Beside staring into a screen all day, I also have great fun doing competitive sailing as well as 
neglecting numerous musical instruments collecting dust in my appartement. 

In the open source world, I've engaged myself in projects like Debian-Edu (aka Skolelinux), Cerebrum,
NAV, Luma, Pyrad, Pysmbpasswd etc. Some projects as debian package maintainer - others as developer.
My first meeting with Linux was RedHat 5.2 a while back ago.. before I found Storm Linux (Debian based) 
back in 1999 iirc. Since then, I've been a huge fan of Debian.

I also want, and even started to offer my help in making Ubuntu support kickstart.
