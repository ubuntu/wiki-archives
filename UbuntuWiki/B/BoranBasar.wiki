=== Contributions ===

Mostly I'm helping Turkish Users in #ubuntu-tr channel on Freenode Network. In the meanhwile I'm also helping to Ubuntu Turkish translation over Launchpad. 

=== Future Goals ===

I have plans to create a PPA for Turkish users, especially for the common Turkish FOSS software that are not included in official Ubuntu repositories. New users are experiencing problems with them at compile process, because of their lack of knowledge. In my opinion, supplying them useful applications that they would like to use, will encourage them to use Ubuntu instead of getting bored with the errors which they get when they try to compile something without knowing what they are doing.
