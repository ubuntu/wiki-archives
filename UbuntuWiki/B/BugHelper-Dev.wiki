=== Get Involved ===

We tagged some bugs as '''<nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/bughelper/+bugs?field.tag=bitesize|bitesize]]</nowiki>'''. These are probably easy to solve for your and good to start helping out with bughelper.

Just branch `~bughelper-dev/bughelper/bughelper.main branch` 
(<nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~bughelper-dev/+branch/bughelper/main|link]]</nowiki>) and start hacking on your own branch.

=== Processes ===

* Approved changes are to be found in the `~bughelper-dev/bughelper/main branch` (<nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~bughelper-dev/+branch/bughelper/main|link]]</nowiki>),
* ongoing work happens in people's own bughelper branches. 
* Patches have to be announced on the list and reviewed and merged by somebody else. 
* (This does not apply to changes in `.info` files, but you have to `bugxml -v <info.file>` them first.)
