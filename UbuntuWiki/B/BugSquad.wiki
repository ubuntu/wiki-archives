=== What is the Bug Squad? ===

The Bug Squad is an essential asset in progressing Ubuntu and its <nowiki>[[https://www.ubuntu.com/download/flavours|flavours]]</nowiki>; The Bug Squad is the first point of contact for the bugs filed about Ubuntu. Members assign bugs to packages, ensure that bug reports are complete, find duplicate bug reports, recreate bugs, and forward bugs to their upstream authors. All of these activities help bugs get fixed and subsequently make Ubuntu even better.

What the Bug Squad does is also known as ''Triaging,'' which is similar to the process of prioritizing patients in a hospital based on the severity of their condition. This allows developers to spend their time more effectively, and is a great way to learn about how Ubuntu works as an operating system and as a community. It’s also not uncommon for triagers to discover new and interesting features they didn't know about!

'''Triaging''' bugs consists of several things:

* Responding to new bugs as they are filed.
* Ensuring that new bugs have all the necessary information.
* Assigning bugs to the proper package.
* Confirming bug reports by trying to reproduce them.
* Setting the importance of bugs reports. ''(<nowiki>[[UbuntuBugControl|Bug Control members Only]]</nowiki>)''
* Searching for and marking duplicates in the bug tracking system.
* Sending bugs to their upstream authors, when applicable.
* Cross-referencing bugs from other distributions.
* Expiring old bugs.

Bug triage is an excellent way to start helping out. You get to learn a lot about Ubuntu, its available packages, its infrastructure, and you get a feel for the development pulse.

Another big part of what we do is help new members <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bugs/HowToTriage/|triage bugs]]</nowiki>; On average, over 1,800 bugs are filed every week with more than 500,000 bugs filed so far. The Bug Squad is always in '''NEED''' of more help from the community!
