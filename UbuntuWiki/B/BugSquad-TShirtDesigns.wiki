We're going to decide on official T-Shirt designs - if you have suggestions, please attach them below.

=== Designs ===

* if you install a fortune-mod and fortunes and run <code> fortune -m bug | less </code> there are a few good quotes
* {*} <- Replace the 3 circles though with bugs!!! ;)  Come on, lets see some design ideas!!! I want a bug shirt -- nixternal     * Like this? <nowiki>[[attachment:cluster_bugs.svg]]</nowiki> <<BR>>I also made a "no bug" style logo similar to "no smoking" signs. <nowiki>[[attachment:no_bug.svg]]</nowiki> <<BR>> Also have a bug with a ubuntu target on its head <nowiki>[[attachment:bug_target.svg]]</nowiki> -- draimus
*** Wow - these are neat! In order of preference: 1. no_bug, 2. cluster_bugs, 3. bug_target - <nowiki>[[Motin]]</nowiki>
* What about an exotic african bug with the ubuntu logo on it's back?
* Maybe a orkin man type shirt?
* maybe exotic african bug = scarab beetle?

* here's an idea:  standard logo, except it's misspelt "ubugtu"
   ...then have a little guy erasing the bottom part of the "g" so it looks like an "n" again. :-)   -pbr

* ^ that idea (without the guy): ubugtu - s/g/n/-Team -a7p
