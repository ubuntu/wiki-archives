==== Introduction ====

I belong to small city Baroda,Gujarat,India.Came across Linux during 2006 with RHEL 4.0,RHCE Sessions.Immediately I shifted to Fedora-Zod(Fedora 6).Never had any deep penchant to use Ubuntu till Fedora 11 Cambridge,where I got DVD of Ubuntu 9.04 Jaunty Jackalope in May,2009.I never had such an ease of installation,instant gratification w.r.t Multimedia or Wireless set up or Bluetooth support or Adding/removing of packages or instant booting.I developed fascination to know Ubuntu more & more day in day out,till I dual booted my Thinkpad with Ubuntu 9.04 & Fedora 11 Cambridge.Now I am plunging on developer's side of Ubuntu :)
