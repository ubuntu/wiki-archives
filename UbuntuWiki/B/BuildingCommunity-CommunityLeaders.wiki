__TOC__



The Ubuntu has always been a very openly governed community from the beginning of the project. This open governance means that we have some community organized and run decision-making groups that help to lead and make decisions about different elements of Ubuntu.

In the early days of the project we had the ''Community Council'' and the ''Technical Board'', but as the Ubuntu community has grown we have needed to add additional sub-councils to help lead their specific parts of the community.

The current governance map of Ubuntu looks like this:

''Click the attachments link on this page to get the LibreOffice file for the above diagram and please make updates as our governance adjusts, thanks!''.

This is what the different groups do:

* '''Community Council''' - makes decisions about community processes and provides a place where community members and other leaders can resolve conflict.
* '''Technical Board''' - decided on technical policy for the project. Note that the Technical Board does not choose features and packages that go into Ubuntu, that is something the wider community works on.
* '''LoCo Council''' - leads the LoCo Teams community as well as reviewing and re-approving Approved LoCo Team applications.
* '''IRC Council''' - leads the IRC and IRC operator community and ensures our IRC channels are operating in a safe and respectful manner.
* '''Forums Council''' - leads the Ubuntu Forums community and it's moderators.
* '''Membership Board''' - this is where community contributors can apply to become Ubuntu members.
* '''Application Review Board''' - reviews Free Software applications submitted via the MyApps portal on http://developer.ubuntu.com (commercial applications are reviewed by Canonical).
* '''Developer Membership Board''' - reviews applications for developers to get upload access to the Ubuntu archives.

You can also see the '''Canonical Community Team''' floating in the middle - this team is employed by Canonical to grow, motivate, and build the community in different areas.

Each of the governance bodies report to someone and their parent body ensures they are elected and performing useful work. While the ''Community Council'' and ''Technical Board'' don't report to '''Mark Shuttleworth''', Mark has a veto power to overrule decisions, although this power is rarely if ever used.
