Report :

*** The Fair in Hasselt was a quiet exhibition then the last we had in Genk. 
      There were not many visitors and there was moderate interest in Ubuntu. 
      However, there were some visitors who continued to talk long and we have burned other iso's like mythbuntu and 
      ubuntu unr on a USB disk. 

      We were a team of 5 enthusiastic promoters and have had the time to catch up because it was a quiet fair.

Pictures CD-Box ubuntu :

*** We have made 45 CD-Boxes with copies of ubuntu (15x 10.04 & 30x 10.10), and the visitors liked it more then the original cd, 
      because inside you have the cd and the 2 A4-sheets with info and how to use the LiveCd.
