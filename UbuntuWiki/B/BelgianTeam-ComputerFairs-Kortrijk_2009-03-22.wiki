=== Report ===

Material : no tablecloth (forgotten) ! Posters available but lack of support to fix it on (we need a solution to replace a wall !). We underestimate the value of clean presentation and nice decoration of the booth.

Large public interested by the demonstrations and explanations, the first 3 hours were busiest.
Continuous slideshow on tv screen attracted a lot of curious.

Approx. 60 cd's (Ubuntu 8.10) were burned and distributed to interested 
persons, after explanation and comments. 
Documentation : approx. 100 flyers A6 (ubuntu_strooibriefje4xA6.pdf, initial stock 150) and 50 ex. A4 Informatie-Information_Ubuntu.odt.

Succesfull event, with a lot of positive contacts.

Suggestion : To answer to basic FAQ (how to work with live-cd ? and is dual-boot Ubuntu + Win possible ?), it could be positive to support the answer by demonstrations with a reserve (ad-hoc) computer. It is also a way to keep the attention of interested people and to give more explanations.
