=== About me ===
   
      I'm a 23 year old student in the 4th-year of my Master Degree ('''International Project Manager in IT and Networks''') at ISAIP-ESAIP Group , in France.
      
=== My OpenSource Background ===
   
   I discovered GNU/Linux through '''Mandriva 7.2''' (former Mandrake) in 2000, by this time I was willing to share my Internet connection, and surprisingly it worked very well. Thus I decided to install a few servers such as web server (apache), database server (Mysql) and gameserver (mainly counter-strike and quake3).

   
   In 2002, I changed for '''Gentoo''' . I decided to remove my windows partition and to replace all my windows program with their Linux equivalent.

   Notice : I used the nickname '''Prodigy44''' (view my contributions on the gentoo's forum :       http://forums.gentoo.org/search.php?search_author=Prodigy44).

   
   In 2005, as I was fed up with compiling my whole system every week, I definitely changed for '''Ubuntu''' "Breezy Badger" which is still my favourite Operating System.
