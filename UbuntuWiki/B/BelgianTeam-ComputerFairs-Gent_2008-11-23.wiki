=== Report ===
On a cold winter day, geeky people gathered in the ICC Ghent for another Computer Fair. Many people visited the fair.
We had lots of material to show to people. Jan brought official Ubuntu Cd's, and we distributed about 100 cd's. 
Many people already heard about ubuntu, and lots of them already tried it. Some of those people are still using it, others weren't happy.

A group of three 'windows brainwashed' users complained about ubuntu being unlogical, they were seeking Program Files, a C drive etc...
After a long discussion we managed to convince them that ubuntu ins't unlogical, and they should try using it a bit longer.
At the end of the day we had a nice surplus, that will be deposited on the ubuntu-account.

When we left the ICC, we were nearly snowed in. There was a snow storm going on while we demonstrated ubuntu inside the ICC.
Afterwards we went drinking something, and then parted home.

I enjoyed myself and hope others did so to.
