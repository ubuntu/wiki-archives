=== Report ===
11 may, Lots of sun, Mother's Day and Pentecost. We didn't expect many visitors on the fair... 
Pieter, Thijs, Dieter and Jan were present, and despite the lack of visitors we did rather well! 

We spoke to may visitors and tried to convince them to try ubuntu. We noticed many people are using Ubuntu already, and a lot of them like it very much. The other visitors who aren't using Ubuntu mostly have heard/read about it. We were present to answer their questions.

The people were very generous and we could easily pay our stand fee. Even more! We gathered about € 60 for the Ubuntu-be war chest. It will be deposited soon.

Overall I enjoyed myself a lot, and think the others did as well, hope to see everyone next fair!

Jan planned to have a barbeque but installed Ubuntu on a visitor's laptop instead!
  Fortunately, I was just in time for the BBQ still.  And being able to install Ubuntu in "Türkçe" shows how great Ubuntu is!  -- JanClaeys
