==== Notes ====

Installation-I've never gotten the 'Desktop CD' to install on any of my computers; The 'Server Install' CD works fine.
If you have a hardware raid, grub will give an obscure error after you install;  Go into the bios (F2 when booting up) and change RAID setting from Raid to ATA to get it to work. (The ubuntu installer can handle software raids if you want to use them)

Pcmcia works correctly in dapper, for earlier versions of ubuntu you have to add pci=assign-busses to the kernel boot options.
* - In order to get suspend/hibernate working (if you have an nvidia card) goto http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=471855

and
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NvidiaLaptopBinaryDriverSuspend

* *-You have to make some changes in the xorg.conf file for these things to work correctly.  Feel free to email me if you have trouble with this, or just look on www.ubuntuforums.org.
