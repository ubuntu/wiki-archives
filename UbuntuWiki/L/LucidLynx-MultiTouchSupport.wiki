== Multi-Touch Support in Ubuntu ==

There is a market/community demand for multi-touch support on devices running Ubuntu. This page pulls together the related efforts, conversations, and current overall status. (Do note, however, that status on individual tasks is tracked in the blueprints.)

=== Related Blueprints ===

* UbuntuSpec:desktop-lucid-xorg-multitouch
* UbuntuSpec:desktop-lucid-touchscreen-handling

=== Initial Plan ===

1. First stage the kernel and X driver changes within Bryce's
       xorg-edgers PPA...similar to how we tested nouveau support. Andy
       believes we should be able to enable all 7 kernel drivers for
       multi-touch, including N-Trig, as they are fairly
       self-contained.

1. We will then have Rafi perform some initial testing of the
       N-trig driver and X packages to make sure the experience they
       provide matches his expectations. We'll also get his advice on
       which apps we should use to test basic single and multi-touch
       functionality.

1. We can then do a call for testing in Beta 1 against the PPA.
       We'd specifically like those with N-Trig to test, but would
       welcome users of the other drivers as well as those without
       support to test also...to be sure we don't introduce any X
       related regressions. Ironically, Brian Murray has one of the
       supported HP N-Trig laptops, so he will be a perfect lead of
       this test effort.  We would leverage Rafi's expertise in
       addressing any bugs opened.

1. Finally, we will assess the stability before the Beta 2
       release, and decide whether or not to push the kernel and X
       updates into Lucid, or just put them into a PPA created
       exclusively for touch enablement in Lucid. Then, assuming the
       base enablement code stabilizes in the upstream kernel and X
       trees, we can push the packages into 10.04.1.
