=== Current Issues ===
Wireless needed patch to get working.  There are at least two methods to get it to work:

==== Proprietary wireless driver ====

This procedure must be repeated every time the kernel gets updated.  The wireless quality is better using the proprietary driver.

http://madwifi.org/ticket/1192
<pre>
# Connect to wired network and install build-essential (sudo apt-get install build-essential)
# wget http: / /snapshots.madwifi.org/madwifi-hal-0.10.5.6/madwifi-hal-0.10.5.6-r3835-20080801.tar.gz
</pre>
Note: alternative link: http://eeedora.googlecode.com/svn-history/r138/trunk/generate-rpms/madwifi/madwifi-hal-0.10.5.6-r3835-20080801.tar.gz
<pre>
2. tar -zxvf madwifi-hal-0.10.5.6-r3835-20080801.tar.gz
3. cd madwifi-hal-0.10.5.6-r3835-20080801
4. sudo make
5. sudo make install
6. System -> Administration -> Hardware Drivers -> Uncheck both hal and Atheros support
7. sudo vi /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist -> blacklist ndiswrapper (Do this if you had tried ndiswrapper)
</pre>

==== Free/Libre driver ====

(As of 2008/10/16, Hardy's updated kernel supports the native linux driver for this device, but you need to blacklist the ath_pci module for the nonfree driver in the restricted-modules package so that they do not conflict.  You only need to do this once, but the free driver works very well, but not as well as the non-free one.)

For Intrepid (currently not release 2008-10-13), adding 
<pre>
"blacklist ath_pci" to /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
</pre>
and rebooting results in working wireless. The Ath9k driver is the completely FOSS driver for the wireless chip and it works almost as well as the proprietary madwifi driver.

==== Wireless caveat ====

The LED doesn't light up when I press the wireless button.   If you press it, you may dissable wireless without knowing it.  If you power off and then power on (not reboot), wireless should be on.   I may have wasted my time trying to "fix" the wireless when I merely disabled it by pressing a button I didn't think did anything...
