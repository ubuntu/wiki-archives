== Ubuntu and Education : Community ==

We are currently building a community around Ubuntu and Education.

We are looking to engage the various users and stakeholders in the Education Sector a way which:
* brings them into our community according to their needs
* assists them to find guidance and solutions for their specific requirements
* allows them to share their learnings
* and helps them to contribute towards an integrated and comprehensive end-to-end Open Source Education solution which is widely adopted and well supported.

== LoCo Teams and Education : How to help with Ubuntu and the Education Sector ==

=== Education Contact for each LoCo ===

We would like to ask each loco group to nominate an Education Contact for their territory, to:
* act as the 1st line Education Contact for their LoCo, and to channel requests to Richard
* to be listed as the education contact for their territory
** on this page
** on their loco page
** on the Ubuntu Education community space which is being built
* to stay in touch with Education happenings in their territory

The nominated person would not need any Education background or experience; just a personal interest in Education as well as the willingness and patience to field enquiries from often non-technical education people.

Mostly, you would be:
* introducing people once off to the Ubuntu and Education community resources and contacts
* keeping an eye out for local Education Events or Projects or News to pass on to Richard

If you would be willing to volunteer:
* you can edit yourself directly into this page,
* send an introduction email to JonoBacon and RichardWeideman

=== Ubuntu Education IRC Channels ===

We'd also like you all to make your community aware of our two Education specific IRC channels:

* '''#ubuntu-education'''
** Ubuntu Education : Education Topics Across any Ubuntu Product
* '''#edubuntu'''
** Edubuntu product Discussions & Support

both on freenode.net

=== Education Mail Lists ===

And finally, we'd like you all to make your community aware of our three Education specific mail lists:

* https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-education
** '''Ubuntu Education posts''' discuss education issues which impact users or stakeholders of any Ubuntu products in the Education sector

* https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/edubuntu-devel
** '''Edubuntu Developer posts''' discuss developement and technical administration issues around the Edubuntu product

* https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/edubuntu-users
** '''Edubuntu User posts''' discuss on user issues around the Edubuntu product.
