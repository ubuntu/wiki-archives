By far, linaporras is one of the most active and prominent members in our community.  Is just a joy to work with her as She puts all her energy and effort on fullfill our goals.  She deserves to be an Ubuntu Member since ages, however as She has worked most on the community side of things only as today (and after too many pokes ;) She has applied for the membership.  I really recommend her as She's one of our local stars, She makes Ubuntu Colombia rock everyday :).  <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AndresMujica|AndresMujica]]</nowiki>

Finally (she really deserv it)!!! Many people in the Ubuntu Colombian community knows the impact, importance and big efforts that she give to all the Team! She is proud of the Ubuntu community, made a lot of work inside the community, have a lot of responsabilities and a big example of leadership.

I testify! :) Lina is one of the best member in Ubuntu-Co. She likes to help in every event where Ubuntu-co participates, I really believe she will be a great Ubuntu member and could make big contributions to the community as she has done in events like <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DiaDelUsuarioUbuntu/oneiric|UbuntuUserDay]]</nowiki>, and why not participate in UbuntuWomen project in a near future.
