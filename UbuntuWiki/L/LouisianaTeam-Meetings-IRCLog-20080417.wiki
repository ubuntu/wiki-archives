21:04:38 [ johndoc] to ChrisULM actually
21:04:38 [ r2d2rogers] we'll be against a wall for power....
21:04:39 [ johndoc] but yes
21:04:51 [ r2d2rogers] not in the section we were hoping for
21:04:59 [ Palintheus] bah
21:05:17 [ Palintheus] any reason they moved us?
21:05:21 [ r2d2rogers] but not a bad placement
21:05:23 [ r2d2rogers] power
21:05:27 [ r2d2rogers] http://www.ares-nela.org/hamfest/Floorplan2008.gif
21:05:36 [ r2d2rogers] got a wall too though
21:05:40 [ r2d2rogers] projector FTW?
21:05:51 [ Palintheus] great...right by the crapper
21:05:58 [ r2d2rogers] lol
21:06:00 [ r2d2rogers] yeah
21:06:21 [ r2d2rogers] not happy about the half the tables unused too though
21:06:32 [ Palintheus] yeah
21:07:26 [ r2d2rogers] will have to see what attracts the least attention and put it on table 6
21:07:28 ::: jms1989_compaq [n=jms1989@unaffiliated/jms1989] has joined #ubuntu-us-la
21:07:33 [ r2d2rogers] not clog up the restroom lines
21:07:38 [ r2d2rogers] maybe that will be the women's?
21:08:02 [ r2d2rogers] ahyhow
21:08:05 [ Palintheus] eh
21:08:05 [ r2d2rogers] other issue
21:08:08 [ Palintheus] k
21:08:13 [ r2d2rogers] sleeves for the CDs
21:08:58 [ r2d2rogers] $10 a box of 100 at sams
21:09:09 [ Palintheus] not bad
21:09:22 [ r2d2rogers] http://www.samsclub.com/shopping/navigate.do?dest=5&item=150144
21:09:24 [ ATDT] Title: Sam's Club - Quality Park Paper CD/DVD Sleeve (at www.samsclub.com)
21:10:04 [ Palintheus] avail in store or...
21:10:09 [ r2d2rogers] $108 for 400 Cd's in sleeves
21:10:15 [ r2d2rogers] checking that
21:10:57 [ r2d2rogers] looks like no
21:11:11 [ r2d2rogers] This item ships Office Preferred Delivery via small package carrier of the suppliers choice to the 48 contiguous states only and is generally delivered within 1 to 2 business days.
21:11:15 [ r2d2rogers] doable
21:11:27 [ r2d2rogers] but I don't have the cash for it before the end of the week
21:11:38 [ Palintheus] hrm
21:11:48 [ r2d2rogers] my wife's monthly payday didn't fall between mine this time
21:12:31 [ Palintheus] oops
21:12:42 [ r2d2rogers] has wharp recv'd the business cards?
21:13:02 [ Palintheus] iirc yes, think he commented on some being cut off center
21:13:08 [ r2d2rogers] that's right
21:13:13 [ Palintheus] I would normally be up for it, but we are trying to cut back expenses atm
21:13:18 [ r2d2rogers] yeah
21:13:28 [ r2d2rogers] we'll figure out something
21:13:32 [ Palintheus] k
21:13:41 [ Palintheus] but...
21:13:44 [ r2d2rogers] I've got a client arranging payment with me by monday
21:13:47 [ Palintheus] we need to do it at the latest monday
21:13:52 [ r2d2rogers] I agree
21:14:02 [ r2d2rogers] I'm waiting to see when a payment is drafted also
21:14:39 [ r2d2rogers] if it all works out, I'll get the sleeves and the cd's  and just see who's up for helping out there
21:14:48 [ Palintheus] so Im assuming the CDs alone are $68
21:14:55 [ r2d2rogers] you got it.
21:14:57 [ Palintheus] k
21:15:02 [ r2d2rogers] $.17 per
21:15:19 [ Palintheus] hmm...
21:15:43 [ r2d2rogers] will get with the person helping me on thrusday and kick that off
21:16:08 [ Palintheus] if all the people on the table show up $12 per will cover that
21:17:05 [ r2d2rogers] we need to get the label figured out
21:17:23 [ r2d2rogers] that will be good
21:17:31 ::: bobradarbob [n=chatzill@user-0c2ijg8.cable.earthlink.net] has joined #ubuntu-us-la
21:17:45 [ Palintheus] yeah
21:17:47 [ r2d2rogers] less than $20 total for the fest each would be nice (including one admission)
21:17:50 [ r2d2rogers] Howdy bobradarbob
21:17:55 [ bobradarbob] hey hey
21:18:00 [ johndoc] hey bob
21:18:08 [ bobradarbob] eve all
21:18:24 [ r2d2rogers] Summary,
21:18:49 [ r2d2rogers] Palintheus emailed Carl about our loaner demo from System76
21:19:17 [ r2d2rogers] http://www.ares-nela.org/hamfest/Floorplan2008.gif
21:19:22 [ r2d2rogers] out booth is labeled th4re
21:19:38 [ r2d2rogers] we need the sleeves for the CD's
21:19:52 [ r2d2rogers] you can get them shipped from Sam's Club for about $40
21:20:02 [ r2d2rogers] the Cd's will cost about $68
21:20:29 [ r2d2rogers] the Hamfest site was partially corrected from the original verbiage
21:20:35 [ r2d2rogers] no mention of ubuntu...
21:20:44 [ ke5tpy] ah well, something's better than nothing, I guess
21:21:05 [ ke5tpy] if you can't have right, I guess better will do
21:21:09 [ r2d2rogers] I will be meeting David Gore to check out a cellular internet Card from Altell on monday
21:21:36 [ r2d2rogers] we are near a wall on the booth, so we can use a projector on the wall probably
21:21:41 [ r2d2rogers] anything I missed?
21:22:11 [ Palintheus] doesn't look that way...
21:22:18 [ Palintheus] backup plan for delayed release?
21:22:25 [ Palintheus] RC or Gutsy?
21:22:30 [ r2d2rogers] that's my wonder too
21:22:38 [ r2d2rogers] i'd lean toward RC
21:22:48 [ Palintheus] yeah, its been no issue for me
21:22:52 [ r2d2rogers] depending on reason for delay
21:22:56 [ Palintheus] and should be an easy upgrade
21:23:04 [ r2d2rogers] yup
21:23:53 [ Palintheus] any other input on that?
21:24:39 [ Palintheus] guess not...
21:24:59  * r2d2rogers wishes he'd had more time to study for the hamtest
21:24:59 [ Palintheus] OK do we want to rough out what each computer will be doing, or at least what we want on the computers?
21:25:17 [ Palintheus] (screencasts on this one, this one doing that, etc)
21:25:49 [ r2d2rogers] ::nods::
21:26:05 [ r2d2rogers] do we have much assembled for that so far?
21:26:12 [ r2d2rogers] I have been out of the loop mostly
21:26:15 ::: michaelramm_mac [n=michaelr@adsl-226-3-175.bhm.bellsouth.net] has joined #ubuntu-us-la
21:26:22 [ r2d2rogers] good evening michaelramm_mac
21:26:48 [ Palintheus] well I tried to bring it up and was told it would be best to wait until setup day, to which I disagree....
21:26:50 [ michaelramm_mac] hey r2d2rogers, what's going on?
21:27:00 [ r2d2rogers] discussion on hamfest plans
21:27:02 [ r2d2rogers] meeting
21:27:15 [ ATDT] New posts from: ubuntuplanet: Yuriy Kozlov: Hardy Release Party in Boston <http://gamemank.wordpress.com/2008/04/16/hardy-release-party-in-boston/>
21:27:37 ::: michaelramm_mac [n=michaelr@adsl-226-3-175.bhm.bellsouth.net] has left #ubuntu-us-la ["Leaving"]
21:27:38 [ Palintheus] I have several screencasts downloaded, installing, desktop tour, app tour, and upgrading
21:27:46 ::: michaelramm_mac [n=michaelr@adsl-226-3-175.bhm.bellsouth.net] has joined #ubuntu-us-la
21:27:47 [ Palintheus] I think that should be good for one computer to loop
21:27:54 [ michaelramm_mac] stupid X button!
21:28:43 [ Palintheus] other than screencasts what do we want on the computers?
21:29:11 [ michaelramm_mac] we are running AL mtg too, so I will be in and out
21:29:20 [ r2d2rogers] did we like the DVD playing idea ?
21:29:26 [ r2d2rogers] cool
21:29:29 [ Palintheus] I still don't know what it is
21:30:39 [ r2d2rogers] I'm not worried about the which one so much as the general idea at this point?
21:30:51 [ r2d2rogers] playing a DVD to sho media stuff?
21:30:52 [ Palintheus] right
21:31:19 [ bobradarbob] Do you mean using something like VLC to play a DVD of some content to be determined?
21:31:26 [ r2d2rogers] yup
21:32:13 [ Palintheus] showing it can play DVDs would be nice
21:32:23 [ Palintheus] I know we want at least 2 just for playing around on yeah?
21:32:29 [ bobradarbob] Just a guess, I'd say you have someone's attention for about 10 min. max in this setting. Use it wisely
21:32:30 [ r2d2rogers] yup
21:32:33 [ wharp] o/
21:32:35 [ r2d2rogers] prefer 3 to me
21:32:49 [ Palintheus] yeah
21:33:22 [ Palintheus] so 1 screencast, 1 dvd, 3 for actual demo, 1 left
21:33:34 [ bobradarbob] def porn :))
21:33:40 [ ke5tpy] -_-
21:33:43 [ ke5tpy] Fail.
21:34:05 [ r2d2rogers] johndoc: got another case option for you
21:34:20 [ johndoc] yeah?
21:34:24 [ r2d2rogers] in case the front panel on the one I gave you couldn't be fixed
21:34:38 [ r2d2rogers] woke up FaceThePain on his couch just now
21:34:58 [ r2d2rogers] he'll bring it in tomorrow if he remembers
21:35:23 [ r2d2rogers] the one left....
21:35:27 [ r2d2rogers] our site for sign up?
21:35:30 [ r2d2rogers] ML?
21:35:33 [ r2d2rogers] formums?
21:35:37 [ r2d2rogers] Ubuntu resources?
21:35:46 [ r2d2rogers] or is that better for the demo machines?
21:35:54 [ r2d2rogers] wiat
21:36:02 [ r2d2rogers] the one left is the ham software machine
21:37:40 [ r2d2rogers] any other concerns/comments/issues/thoughts?
21:37:56 [ Palintheus] on the ham software machine...
21:38:07 [ r2d2rogers] at this point the after party will be us getting to sit around and eat and talk/socialize
21:38:07 [ Palintheus] should we decide on that machine now...
21:38:15 [ Palintheus] need to get it installed/configured
21:38:16 [ r2d2rogers] which is will be?
21:38:39 [ ke5tpy] is there any reason we can't decide on it now?
21:38:41 [ r2d2rogers] I was thinking the system 76 might be the most impressive, depending on what Cark says
21:38:50 [ r2d2rogers] carl
21:39:20 [ r2d2rogers] fresh install... the altell card in it, not sharing the network access
21:39:29 [ r2d2rogers] thoughts?
21:39:33 [ Palintheus] for the ham software?
21:39:36 [ r2d2rogers] yup
21:40:04 [ r2d2rogers] other question is what laptop where...
21:40:14 [ r2d2rogers] has everyone seen the layout and where our booth will be?
21:40:34 [ ke5tpy] let's determine what machine should be farthest from the bathroom :P
21:40:40 [ r2d2rogers] yeah
21:40:45 [ Palintheus] yeah, but still hard to decide without being there, and thats not really as important as whats on the computers
21:41:02 [ ke5tpy] yeah the computers can (and will) be arranged on friday
21:41:04 [ r2d2rogers] cool
21:41:09 [ r2d2rogers] setup day question
21:41:11 [ r2d2rogers] k
21:41:41 [ wharp] need to make sure good/bad/ugly codecs are installed on all the machines we're letting people play with in case they've got some media they want to try out
21:41:44 [ r2d2rogers] so do we like the autoplaying machine next to the try it out machine ?
21:42:00 [ r2d2rogers] wharp: ++
21:42:14 [ bobradarbob] +
21:42:25 [ Palintheus] but on the same note...do we want to educate people about the codecs that ask?
21:42:33 [ wharp] hm
21:42:36 [ wharp] true
21:42:38 [ r2d2rogers] or demo how easy it is to get them?
21:42:54 [ wharp] that would jsut be a one shot thing unless we want to repeatedly uninstall it
21:43:01 [ Palintheus] well not really where I was going...more on the legality
21:43:10 [ r2d2rogers] ah
21:43:10 [ wharp] ah
21:43:18 [ r2d2rogers] good point Palintheus
21:43:40 [ Palintheus] I mean most won't care...but you never know
21:44:34 [ Palintheus] don't get me wrong, I use them
21:45:43 [ wharp] but telling them will raise awareness of the problem
21:45:51 [ Palintheus] yeah
21:46:08 [ wharp] i doubt it comes up
21:46:18 [ Palintheus] but in case it does, we need to be consistant
21:46:23 [ r2d2rogers] So people who are gonna be in town friday night, hang out/supper?
21:46:27 [ wharp] good luck with that
21:46:46 [ Palintheus] wharp: we can at least try rather than be negative ;)
21:46:59 [ wharp] yeah
21:47:37 [ wharp] if we're going to try we should write up a doc with the things we want to say
21:47:49  * Palintheus nods
21:47:52 [ r2d2rogers] good idea... notes
21:48:53 [ r2d2rogers] wiki or?
21:49:08 [ Palintheus] yeah, would be best
21:49:12 [ Palintheus] (imho)
21:49:46 [ Palintheus] I can try to spend some time on that this weekend
21:50:18 [ Palintheus] ok...back to friday?
21:50:35 [ Palintheus] I will be there mid/early-afternoon
21:50:47 [ wharp] didnt someone say they would look for tablecloths?
21:51:06 [ Palintheus] can't remember :|
21:51:31 [ wharp] want to say ChrisULM did, but not sure
21:51:57 [ r2d2rogers] that was my thought also
21:52:35 [ ChrisULM] wasnt me
21:52:39 [ wharp] hm
21:53:07 [ wharp] what color would we want?
21:53:29 [ r2d2rogers] not white? <G>
21:53:53 [ Palintheus] hm
21:54:08 [ wharp] grey?
21:54:25 [ Palintheus] that would be good imo
21:54:46 [ wharp] would have said brown, but that would be too easy to class with the ubuntu browns
21:54:58 [ wharp] s/class/clash
21:55:02  * Palintheus nods
21:55:34 [ wharp] and they're 8x2foot tables?
21:55:39 [ r2d2rogers] yup
21:57:20 [ wharp] crap, how come I'm not idling
21:57:28 [ r2d2rogers] ?
21:57:34 [ r2d2rogers] woot
21:57:40 [ r2d2rogers]  you mean I have a chance to catch up?
21:58:02 [ Palintheus] I can contribute $25 to the overall costs
21:58:14 [ r2d2rogers] Palintheus: +!
21:58:21 [ bobradarbob] gtg, will read summary and catch up - later all
21:58:27 [ r2d2rogers] I can do the same
21:58:30 [ r2d2rogers] up to
21:58:39 ::: bobradarbob [n=chatzill@user-0c2ijg8.cable.earthlink.net] has quit ["ChatZilla 0.9.81 [Firefox 2.0.0.14/2008040413]"]
21:58:49 [ wharp] well....I've already purchased the business cards but I can probably contribute
21:58:55 [ wharp] though I am looking at table cloths atm
21:59:14 [ r2d2rogers] I'm not counting my admission
21:59:34 [ Palintheus] well, if we can find them for $25 shipped I can order and have them shipped to r2d2rogers 
21:59:38 [ r2d2rogers] and I think I still want to get some cards from you, I'll be putting 5 or so in that pot too
21:59:52 [ Palintheus] r2d2rogers: yeah same here, that as on top of my admission
22:00:49 [ wharp] I don't think we're going to find 3 for that price with shipping
22:01:15 [ Palintheus] well, I can pay someone back, cash or paypal, whatever
22:01:26 [ ke5tpy] same here
22:02:19 [ r2d2rogers] cloth or paper?
22:02:28 [ r2d2rogers] thinking $$ right now
22:02:40 [ wharp] cloth
22:02:47 [ r2d2rogers] Oh and anyone have a glass jar good for a donation jar?
22:02:56 [ wharp] paper is worse than nothing imho
22:03:16 [ r2d2rogers] k
22:03:21 [ johndoc] r2d2rogers, i think a plastic one would be better, doesn't shatter when it's inevitably knocked off the table
22:03:41 [ r2d2rogers] fair point
22:03:45 [ Palintheus] glass jar...not likely but can look...if not I may be able to round up some mason jars from the parents house
22:04:25 [ wharp] somebody just go buy a big thing of candy from sams in a plastic jar and then we have a jar and candy to hand out
22:04:25  * Palintheus has a couple milk jugs laying around
22:04:36 [ r2d2rogers] wharp: +200
22:04:36 [ Palintheus] easy in, but not out
22:04:48 [ wharp] yeah
22:04:52 [ r2d2rogers] candy for the tables..
22:04:54 [ johndoc] hand out/eat?
22:04:59 [ r2d2rogers] johndoc: yes <G>
22:05:13 [ r2d2rogers] looks like my time is up
22:05:13 [ johndoc] excellent, wharp wins
22:05:20 [ r2d2rogers] anything left for me?
22:05:44 [ Palintheus] yeah
22:06:05 [ Palintheus] we wanna have an early meeting next week see if others will show up, make sure everyone is on the same page?
22:07:12 [ r2d2rogers] I like that
22:07:24 [ r2d2rogers] and a final one thursday for headcount ?
22:07:26 [ Palintheus] mon tues?

22:08:17 [ johndoc] i usually am
22:08:30 [ johndoc] we're not going on any field trips, lol
22:08:41 [ r2d2rogers] a good way to discuss the hamfest at the lug too as it's the local event
22:08:52 [ r2d2rogers] I mentioned it to dgore
22:09:00 [ johndoc] irc from the lug is not a problem with me
22:09:02 [ r2d2rogers] but the hamclub has their board meeting that night too
22:09:06 [ r2d2rogers] cool
22:09:15 [ r2d2rogers] tuesday start at 6:30 ?
22:09:19 [ johndoc] as long as we do it and then we're all done so we can then do other lug stuff
22:09:25 [ r2d2rogers] <G>
22:09:31 [ r2d2rogers] 6?
22:09:40 [ johndoc] for this meeting?
22:09:46 [ Palintheus] can't gaurantee an end time ;)
22:10:07 [ r2d2rogers] yeah
22:10:19 [ r2d2rogers] 6 for early people?
22:10:39 [ r2d2rogers] who volunteers to hit the invites?<G>
