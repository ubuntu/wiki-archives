=== Current Issues ===
When booting laptop with 7.10 (gutsy) gdm fails to start.  The boot-up gets to "Running local boot scripts (/etc/rc.local)" then an X error message comes up saying "The display server has been shut down about 6 times in the last 90 seconds.  It is likely that something bad is goin on.  Waiting for 2 minutes before trying again on display:0."  I can then jump to another console Ctrl-Alt-F1 and just type 'startx' and up comes X and Gnome.  After a while the X message will pop up again saying "There already appears to be an  server running on display :0. Should another display number be tried?  Answering no will cause GDM to attempt starting the server on :0 again.  (You can change consoles by pressing Ctrl-Alt plus a function key, such as Ctrl-Alt-F7 to go to console 7.  X servers usually run on consoles 7 and higher.)  Yes   No"  If I say Yes, the screen flickers a while (presumably GDM trying to start X on :1.  Then I get the error message about the server being shut down 6 times and it will wait 2 minutes before re-trying on display :1 over, and over and over.

I was able to fix this issue by starting up X manually and enabling the ATI restricted driver, installing it and rebooting.  Now I just have to figure out how to get sound and wifi to work.
