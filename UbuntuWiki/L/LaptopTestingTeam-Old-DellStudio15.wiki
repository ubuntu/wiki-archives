* Make: DELL
* Brand: STUDIO
* Model: 15 (1555)

=== Issues with Karmic x86-64 ===
* Not able to change brightness properties neither using Fn keys nor by switching to battery only mode, and to eject cd with Fn key out of the box (ACPI seems not working). Solved (partially) with the new BIOS and\or by changing brightness before gdm.
* Crash report generated on resume from suspend. <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/417842|Bug 417842]]</nowiki> (TylerKinkade)

=== Issues with Jaunty x86-64 ===
* No sound. Solved by editing alsa-base.conf according to this <nowiki>[[https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+question/75137|post]]</nowiki>. 

* Blank screen on resume from suspend. <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/395417|Bug 395417]]</nowiki>

* System permanently locked at system unlock page on resume from hibernate. <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/395422|Bug 395422]]</nowiki>

* High GPU temperature. Solved by installing proprietary (ATI) driver.

* Lid close does not trigger suspend or blank screen.

My ACPI related problems with the brightness keys, the eject key, hibernate/suspend and not detecting lid close all seem to have been solved by upgrading to Karmic.  It's a pretty new system I think some better drivers were added in the newer kernels (v1nsai)

=== Issues with Jaunty x86-32 ===
* No sound (Solved using https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HdaIntelSoundHowto)
* Blank screen on resume from suspend. <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/395417|Bug 395417]]</nowiki>
* External mic / line in jack doesn't work.
* Internal webcam video recording is sluggish (low fps) when using resolutions above 800x600.
* Broadcom wireless only works on 2.6.28-11-generic kernel at this time.

=== Notes ===
On Jaunty x86, I had problems with the brightness up/down buttons not working. I fixed this by adding "noapic" to "defoptions=" in /boot/grub/menu.lst . I've also managed to fix hibernate by adding "nomodeset" to the defoptions too. Andrew Thornton
