==== Notes ====
* 1 Used alternate install of Kubuntu
* 2 Install "915resolution" and change "Modes" in /etc/X11/xorg.conf (section "Screen") to "1280x800" (all depths)
* 3 Use hardware button (Fn-F3) to toggle
* 4 Using powersaved and change in /etc/powersave/sleep: SUSPEND2RAM_RESTART_SERVICES="hdparm", SUSPEND2RAM_ACPI_SLEEP="3" and SUSPEND2RAM_SWITCH_VT="yes" (the same for ...2DISK). (NicolasDaLuzDuque: Doesn't work for me on edgy)
* 5 Microphone control missing in alsa
* 6 No PCMCIA, just ExpressCard

==== Important ====
The harddisk frequently "clicks". This sound is produced by the heads when they are moved into a parking position. Unfortunately this happens every few seconds and probably wears the hardware 
(see http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Problem_with_hard_drive_clicking). Install hdparm and add to /etc/hdparm.conf: "/dev/sda { apm = 254 }"
