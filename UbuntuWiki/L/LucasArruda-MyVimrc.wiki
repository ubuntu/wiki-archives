Here is my actual .vimrc code:

" Normally we use vim-extensions. If you want true vi-compatibility
" remove change the following statements
set nocompatible    " Use Vim defaults (much better!)
set backspace=2     " allow backspacing over everything in insert mode
" Now we set some defaults for the editor 
"set autoindent     " always set autoindenting on
"set nobackup        " Don't keep a backup file
set viminfo='20,\"50    " read/write a .viminfo file, don't store more than
            " 50 lines of registers
            set history=50      " keep 50 lines of command line history
            set ruler       " show the cursor position all the time
            " Suffixes that get lower priority when doing tab completion for filenames.
            " These are files we are not likely to want to edit or read.

nnoremap \hc :call InsertCloseTag()<CR>
imap <F8> <Space><BS><Esc>\hca

" With the above mapping and the following function, while typing in insert mode, you can simply press <F8> to have any close tag typed tag for you. (If function keys don.t work in your terminal, then use \hc in normal mode instead.)

function! InsertCloseTag()
" inserts the appropriate closing HTML tag; used for the \hc operation defined
" above;
" requires ignorecase to be set, or to type HTML tags in exactly the same case
" that I do;
" doesn't treat <P> as something that needs closing;
" clobbers register z and mark z
