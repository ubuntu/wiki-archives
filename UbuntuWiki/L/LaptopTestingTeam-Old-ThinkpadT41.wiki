=== Current Issues ===

I discovered some odd behaviour the other day installing the Hardy Heron Release Candidate. The laptop paused for a couple of minutes at the boot screen (with the Ubuntu logo and the progress bar). The hard drive LED was on and I thought it was frozen, however, suddenly it continued. The installation went well.

Visual effects no longer works by the way.

I can no longer connect to my wireless network (WPA encrypted) using the Network Manager application. However, uninstalling the Network Manager and manually setting up the network in /etc/network/interfaces solves the problem.

I added the following to /etc/network/interfaces:

<pre>
iface eth1 inet dhcp
wpa-driver wext
wpa-ssid <undisclosed>
wpa-ap-scan 1
wpa-proto WPA
wpa-pairwise TKIP
wpa-group TKIP
wpa-key-mgmt WPA-PSK
wpa-psk <undisclosed>
</pre>

=== Previous Issues ===

Based on emails I have received lately it seems that there is an issue with suspend / resume in some cases. However, I do not see it on my machine at all. As far as I have looked into this the type of video card seems not to be an issue. (Christian)

An old bug seems to reappear in feisty 7.04 (Herd 1). The wireless network card won't associate with access point when using WEP encryption. [SOLVED]

Also, the wireless hotkey for turning the wireless network card on and off won't work. [SOLVED]

==== Notes ====
* Only by manually enabling this.

* * Turns off screen and when lid is opened the "lock screen" dialogue appears. I suppose the correct behavior would be for the computer to go to sleep or hibernate when lid is closed.

* ** Tested and worked in last Dapper Flight release

* *** Does not 'just work' but with the following config file (I have my laptop to the left of my 19 inch monitor) for xorg.conf everything works fine and dandy (extended desktop) only tested with breezy, dapper (should work in dapper as well) was pissing me off.  With a stock config I was able to get mirroring to work by just rebooting.  (edit: after a bit i found out that DRI is thus disabled, there is slight hope that option "MergeFB" or something like that enables DRI with an extended desktop, but for now I am back to the stock xorg.conf with DRI until someone can figure it out, since I have no clue)  --Thomas Wolfe
