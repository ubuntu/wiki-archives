__TOC__

* Contact: KamilPáral
* Make: Lenovo
* Brand: Thinkpad R61
* Model: 8918-DEG (and 7742-NCG, 2,4 GHz CPU added by Franko30)
* Website: 

=== Current Issues ===

* Hibernation does not work with nvidia proprietary driver (resume fails).
* With the 7742-NCG, standby only works with nvidia's proprietary driver, not with the standard driver.
* External display does not work with nvidia proprietary driver when using Fn-keys, you must use nvidia-settings utility.
* Sometimes after suspend resume or user switch there is only white screen on model 8918-DEG. Just write your password on blind and hit enter, you will return to your desktop without problems. This only happens with nvidia driver.

=== Notes ===

Franko30 added the 7742-NCG model to this report, as it only has a different CPU.

The R61 7742-NCG freezes completely with 8.04 when ejecting multibay battery and/or DVD. System has to be powered down to change multibay modules.

==== Back and Forward keys (Hardy only) ====
Does not work by default in Hardy, but it's not hard to enable them. Open Terminal and run this command:
<pre>
echo -e 'keycode 234 = XF86Back\nkeycode 233 = XF86Forward' >> ~/.Xmodmap
</pre>
Log out and in again. Ubuntu will ask you if you want to include `~/.Xmodmap` file in your keyboard configuration, include it and confirm. That's it.

If you don't receive any dialog, you can use `gconf-editor` to set keys `/desktop/gnome/peripherals/keyboard/general/known_file_list` and `/desktop/gnome/peripherals/keyboard/general/update_handlers` to value `[.Xmodmap]`.

If you are not using Gnome, run this command in your session manager after login:
<pre>
xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap
</pre>

==== Simultaneous playing of many audio sources (Hardy only) ====
After default Ubuntu 8.04 install, there is some problem when playing multiple audio sources:

* Totem and Rhythmbox plays simultaneously (as any GStream applications)
* Rhythmbox and most games (Extreme Tux Racer, Frozen Bubble) does not play simultaneously
* Rhythmbox and flash videos does not play simultaneously

To fix this, as <nowiki>[[RootSudo|root]]</nowiki> edit file `/etc/pulse/default.pa`:
<pre>
gksudo gedit /etc/pulse/default.pa
</pre>
find this line:
<pre>
load-module module-hal-detect
</pre>
and change it to this:
<pre>
</pre>
Also to the end of the file add these two lines:
<pre>
load-module module-alsa-sink
load-module module-alsa-source
</pre>

Save file, close editor, logout and log in again. The sound should work now in most cases simultaneously.
