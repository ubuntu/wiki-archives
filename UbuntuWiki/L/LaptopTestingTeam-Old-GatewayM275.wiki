=== Current Issues ===

Pressing hotkeys that have no keycode causes the mouse icon to turn into an inch square distorted icon that goes away when the mouse is moved around a bit.

ACPID logs when the standby button is pressed, but the computer does not standby. <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/gnome-power-manager/+bug/64985|64985]]</nowiki>
