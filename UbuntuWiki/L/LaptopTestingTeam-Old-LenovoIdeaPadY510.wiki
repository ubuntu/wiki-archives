==== Notes ====
For sound to properly work the following line needs to be added to /etc/modprobe.d/options:
options snd-hda-intel model=lenovo-ms7195-dig

Without this the volume is very low and the built in subwoofer will not work.

When coming out of standby you have to turn the wireless kill switch off and then on for the wireless to work again.
