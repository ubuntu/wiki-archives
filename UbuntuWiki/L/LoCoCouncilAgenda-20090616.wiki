| Launchpad teams for LoCo Teams
|}

As result of talks regarding the LoCoDirectory, new teams were created to simply group LoCo teams and sort them for the application. keeping separate which ones are LoCo teams and which ones are approved.

A status on the progress was presented:

* 75% of teams populated.
* Small issues with naming convention ( ubuntu-(iso-country-code): Teams that really want to will have to ask nicely to see if they can get their names for their teams. If bad comes to worse they will have to stick to what other name they have.
* ~locoteams-approved is restricted and further discussion on how to populate it and the reapproval process will be discussed in the mailing lists and brought in for the next meeting.

It was decided that the ForumCouncil or any admin can decide what naming convention suits them better.
