__TOC__

        
* Contact: MatteoZandi
* Brand: Toshiba
* Model: Satellite M40-281 (2GHz Centrino, ATI X700 256MB)
* Website: http://www.toshiba.com

Note that laptop has a non Toshiba BIOS (Phonenix) so toshiba_acpi will not work.

=== Notes on Edgy ===
* boot is much faster and the overall system is much better
* I dropped s1bl, you can use tecra_acpi (http://www.gesal.org/tecra/) written for Toshiba Tecra S1 is fully compatible with M40-281, otherwise omnibook module (http://omnibook.sourceforge.net/doku.php) wich supports hp as well as toshiba notebooks. Omnibook module doesn't support hotkeys but it is compatible with gnome-power-manager, so with Feisty it will be possible to change the brightness with the brightness applet!! If you prefer using Fn keys check out tecra_acpi but it won't work out of the box.

=== Notes on Dapper ===
* No more firewire-related modules problem :) No need to blacklist drivers, wired and unwired network cards work out of the box
* No more ipv6 issue
* Fn keys don't work so you won't be able to change brigthness, but s1bl (http://tz.exit0.net/tecras1.html) doesn't work anymore.. it's a kernel 2.6.15 issue, compile 2.6.16 from kernel.org and it will work again

=== Notes on Breezy ===
* loading firewire-related modules (ieee1394, ohci1394, eth1394, sbp2 - I believe that's all, though there could be more) will cause the kernel to disable IRQ #11. See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LaptopTestingTeam/ToshibaSatelliteM40-JM8. Prevent them from loading with
** nano /etc/hotplug/blacklist and add these drivers: ieee1394 ohci1394 eth1394 sbp2
** nano /etc/modules and remove sbp2
* ipv6 caused me DNS not working
** sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/aliases - comment alias net-pf-10 ipv6
** in firefox, type 'about:config' and put ''''true'''' on network.dns.disableIPv6
* Fn keys don't work so you won't be able to change brigthness, see http://tz.exit0.net/tecras1.html
