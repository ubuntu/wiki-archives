=== Current Issues ===
While the Fn-XX combinations related to power management work, the functions they are supposed to perform are not. Sleep makes the screen go blank for a moment, then X come back with the screen saver password dialog opened. Hibernation causes the machine to hang, a powercycle is required in order to get it back up. Another issue with both the multimedia and the Fn-XX keys is that they work after a delay, usually 5-10s (the multimedia keys are volume up, down, mute).

Another issue is the ACPI. During the bootup, the

ACPI: Could not use ECDT

shows up. It seems the ACPI code is compiled with the Microsoft compiler and contains two
errors which show up when using the Intel compiler. But even after fixing the two up, the
above message appears. Not sure wheter it has any influence on the way the machine works, but I think it's important to mention that here.

The third issue is with the activity leds below the LCD. The radio activity one doesn't work. There used to be a patch for madwifi  that was supposed to enable it for ThinkPads, but I can't locate it anywhere now.
