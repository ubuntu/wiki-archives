==== Notes ====
The modem is a software modem. The appropriate alsa driver is inserted, but it requires slmodemd to work
The firewire port is detected properly, and the right modules are installed (I have tested it in Gentoo before), but i have not tested it
The 802.11g PCMCIA card does not even register on cardctl, it does work in windows, and i have tried other pcmcia cards in gentoo
