==== Notes ====
To get Suspend2Ram to work follow these instructions:

Add 'options nvidia NVreg_Mobile=3 NVreg_SoftEDIDs=0' to /etc/modprobe/nvidia-kernel-nkc to get Suspend to work. Look at /usr/share/doc/NVIDIA_GLX-1.0/README.txt for more information on NVreg-options.

Edit /etc/defaults/acpi-support and disable SAVE_VBE_STATE, SAVE_PCI_STATE and POST_VIDEO.
