==== Notes ====

1) The notebook has a "smart" battery installed. The battery state is read via the System Managment Bus (SMBus). With a kernel patch I got the thing to work. See http://shayol.bartol.udel.edu/~rhdt/download/acpi_sbs-20050120.tar.gz

2) When I have mysqld running then hibernating the machine is not possible because mysqld can not be stopped. When mysqld is not running hibernate works like a charm.
