__TOC__

'''Graphics''' - The card is either an Intel GMA 4500M or NVIDIA GeForce 9300M. I do not know about the Intel Card, as my configuration (2746-4HG) does not use it, but for the NVIDIA, the drivers from the website work fine. 3D Acceleration works: glxinfo | grep rendering gives: Direct Rendering Yes.

'''Internet''' - Wired and Wireless (using the Intel WiFi Link 5100 Card) connections work out of the box.

'''Touchpad''' - Works out of the box, but for additional config options, install the package gsynaptics, and run <code>gsynaptics</code> from terminal.

'''Sound''' - Works out of the box.

'''Volume Buttons, Hotkeys, and Bluetooth'''  -  To make the volume buttons work, run <code>sudo modprobe lenovo-sl-laptop</code> from terminal. To enable on startup, add <code>lenovo-sl-laptop</code> to <code>/etc/modules</code>.

'''USB Ports''' - All work OOTB.

'''Power Management''' - Works OOTB, but resuming from sleep or hibernate is a bit slow.
