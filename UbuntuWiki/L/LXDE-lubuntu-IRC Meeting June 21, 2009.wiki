(11:18:31 SGT) The topic for #lubuntu is: Lubuntu project channel. Project details at https://launchpad.net/~lubuntu-desktop

(11:19:11 SGT) johnthng: when is the meeting?

(11:21:16 SGT) payne left the room.

(11:22:57 <nowiki>SGT) payne1 [n=Dayal_Da@115.134.159.244] entered the room.</nowiki>

(11:23:21 <nowiki>SGT) pastund [n=pastund@p5499F75F.dip.t-dialin.net] entered the room.</nowiki>

(11:23:28 SGT) starfall87: it should be right now

(11:23:41 SGT) starfall87: but it seems that pcman and mario are held up doing something or another

(11:23:56 SGT) pastund: greetings

(11:24:04 SGT) starfall87: hi

(11:24:11 <nowiki>SGT) pcman [n=pcman@114-41-10-202.dynamic.hinet.net] entered the room.</nowiki>

(11:24:14 SGT) pcman: here

(11:24:23 SGT) pcman: anyone's here?

(11:24:28 SGT) payne1: hi

(11:24:30 SGT) AndrewLee: Let's start the meeting or wait for Mario?

(11:24:51 SGT) pcman: I'm not able to get online previously.

(11:25:01 SGT) starfall87: ahh, well great that you could make it

(11:25:03 SGT) johnthng: ya

(11:25:15 SGT) starfall87: I think we should just start the meeting, who will keep the log?

(11:30:01 SGT) pcman: will mario be here?

(11:30:14 SGT) AndrewLee: pcman: maybe later

(11:30:19 SGT) starfall87: It is unknown, I thought he was going to make it,

(11:30:34 SGT) pcman: so, let's start.

(11:31:26 SGT) starfall87: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lubuntu/Applications

(11:31:26 SGT) starfall87: I believe we were to Games?

(11:31:35 SGT) pcman: yes

(11:31:45 SGT) pcman: but before we start, I have to say something.

(11:31:54 SGT) starfall87: please go ahead

(11:32:02 SGT) pcman: the assumption I made previously about update-manager was wrong.

(11:32:03 SGT) pcman: sorry.

(11:32:19 SGT) starfall87: please remind me of that assumption?

(11:32:21 SGT) pcman: the tray applet was written in C, and it calls python program for update periodically.

(11:32:30 SGT) pcman: it's not totally in python.

(11:32:44 SGT) starfall87: wow! I did not know that either

(11:32:51 SGT) pcman: the constantly running part seems to be in C.

(11:33:00 SGT) starfall87: that is good

(11:33:09 SGT) pcman: not 100% sure about that.

(11:33:15 <nowiki>SGT) Genelyk [n=genelyk@190.233.222.27] entered the room.</nowiki>

(11:33:16 SGT) pcman: but it's partially in C.

(11:33:22 SGT) pcman: ok, let's continue.

(11:33:29 SGT) starfall87: Alrighty then, now that that is clear, lets look at games

(11:33:32 SGT) pcman: everybody is here?

(11:33:52 SGT) starfall87: the first major decision is to include any games or no games?

(11:34:04 SGT) pcman: no game +1

(11:34:04 SGT) starfall87: Well they were just moments ago

(11:34:11 SGT) starfall87: no game +1

(11:34:18 SGT) payne1: +1

(11:34:35 SGT) pcman: waiting for others.....

(11:34:38 SGT) elfgoh: -1 i think some small games should be provided

(11:34:59 SGT) johnthng: -1

(11:34:59 SGT) elfgoh: It's boring to use a computer without games to waste time sometimes ;)

(11:35:02 SGT) aluddin: -1

(11:35:07 SGT) johnthng: small games benefit

(11:35:08 SGT) pcman: +1 if only small ones are included and we do have some extra spaces on the cd.

(11:35:46 SGT) elfgoh: pcman: +1

(11:35:47 SGT) pcman: if all apps are included already, it's nice to have some games on the rest space of the installer cd.

(11:35:50 SGT) starfall87: The only large package of light games I can think of are the gnome ones, are they very dependent on obscure gnome deps?

(11:36:04 SGT) pcman: starfall87: yes

(11:36:15 SGT) pcman: starfall87: some even depends on avahi or something.

(11:36:18 SGT) pcman: quite intersting.

(11:36:30 SGT) johnthng: yup, but include presentable games pls

(11:36:30 SGT) pcman: how can those small games depend on so many gnome stuff?

(11:36:45 SGT) starfall87: http://packages.ubuntu.com/jaunty/gnome-games for reference

(11:36:46 SGT) johnthng: not the classic breakout in 1970s mode ...

(11:38:18 SGT) pcman: last time I do apt-get install gnome-games, it gave me tons of gnome deps.

(11:38:24 SGT) starfall87: pcman: I do not know

(11:38:35 SGT) starfall87: well what version of debian/ubuntu are you using

(11:38:42 SGT) johnthng: tkspider seemed good.

(11:38:55 SGT) pcman: starfall87: it's more than one years ago.

(11:39:16 SGT) pcman: maybe this is caused by 'treating suggested packages as dependencies'

(11:39:33 SGT) starfall87: pcman: yeah, my thinking to, but that is only to some extent

(11:39:38 SGT) pcman: ok

(11:40:02 SGT) elfgoh: well I personally think frozen bubble... though i am not sure if the dependecies are acceptable

(11:40:12 SGT) Genelyk: games ??

(11:40:14 SGT) Genelyk: uhmmm

(11:40:23 SGT) pcman: I suggest putting the games section in lower priority and let's finish the core parts of the desktop first.

(11:40:33 SGT) starfall87: I agree with that

(11:40:37 SGT) johnthng: Ya, but games can be included

(11:40:41 SGT) pcman: agree

(11:40:45 SGT) payne1: sure

(11:40:45 SGT) starfall87: table games for the moment +1

(11:40:47 SGT) pcman: some little games are good.

(11:40:55 SGT) johnthng: cos puppylinux has included games that are small.

(11:41:01 SGT) johnthng: and still the iso is not so big

(11:41:05 SGT) pcman: ok

(11:41:06 SGT) johnthng: is still quite small

(11:41:16 SGT) starfall87: I think that brings us to Graphics then

(11:41:24 SGT) pcman: can we jump to graphics and come back later?

(11:41:25 SGT) elfgoh: i think should be possible since lxde is so small compared to gnome

(11:41:32 SGT) pastund: DamnSmallLinux has also a collection

(11:41:33 SGT) elfgoh: yea sure go to graphics

(11:41:41 SGT) johnthng: ok graphics

(11:41:44 SGT) starfall87: ok first, Xsane?

(11:41:50 SGT) pcman: xsane -1

(11:42:01 SGT) pcman: most of the users don't have scanner

(11:42:03 SGT) elfgoh: +1

(11:42:27 SGT) elfgoh: +1 to have xsane i meant

(11:42:33 SGT) pcman: reason?

(11:43:13 SGT) ziroday: xsane is rather scary for new users, I know vanilla ubuntu is replacing it

(11:43:18 SGT) Genelyk: pcman +1 , not game, first desktop

(11:43:33 SGT) johnthng: +1 if necessary, but it'll good to direct user to install it ... 

(11:43:52 SGT) elfgoh: I personally think a scanner is important..

(11:43:59 SGT) pcman: ok, but the package is quite small. :)

(11:44:01 SGT) johnthng: xsane is powerful :) but it's not so automatic like cups

(11:44:02 SGT) starfall87: +1 to have xsane, I do not think it will bring in very many, if any dependencies if we are also including gimp, It is a basic piece of hardware that lots of people have

(11:44:03 SGT) payne1: +1 me too

(11:44:14 SGT) Genelyk: +1 xsane

(11:44:24 SGT) johnthng: nowadays people have multi-scan/print/copy devices

(11:44:26 SGT) pcman: ok, +1

(11:44:27 SGT) ziroday: what about nostaples instead of xsane? Simpler to use and only relies on python

(11:44:35 SGT) johnthng: printer standalone is not so popular anymore

(11:44:48 SGT) pcman: ziroday: xsane is a C only small gtk+ program.

(11:45:03 SGT) elfgoh: For me, I only know xsane. If any knows a better scanner program please share

(11:45:06 SGT) pcman: xsane+1

(11:45:08 SGT) ziroday: pcman: sure, but its very confusing for most users

(11:45:11 SGT) starfall87: so lets see a final vote

(11:45:11 SGT) starfall87: xane+1

(11:45:23 SGT) pcman: ziroday: not sure. I have no scanner and I haven't use it.

(11:45:46 SGT) pcman: nostaples is not in ubuntu?

(11:45:46 SGT) Genelyk: and tools manager network ?

(11:46:04 SGT) pcman: Genelyk: nm-applet + nm. This is already discussed.

(11:46:05 SGT) starfall87: ziroday: I do not think it is that confusing, I have successfully shown people who are not too hot with computers how to use it and they get it

(11:46:15 SGT) Genelyk: jeje sorry :(

(11:46:27 SGT) pcman: starfall87: can they use it without instructions?

(11:46:48 SGT) starfall87: pcman: after showing them once or twice, they can manage now without help

(11:46:51 SGT) ziroday: starfall87: sure :)

(11:46:54 SGT) johnthng: yes

(11:47:04 SGT) johnthng: it's quite easy to use

(11:47:07 SGT) pcman: ziroday: can the tool you suggested be used without instructions?

(11:47:25 SGT) johnthng: I can create pdf out from xsane

(11:47:29 SGT) ziroday: pcman: http://www.etlafins.com/nostaples

(11:47:49 SGT) pcman: btw, is there any debian/ubuntu command used to get all dependencies of a package recursively?

(11:48:28 SGT) pcman: I mean, can list the dependencies of its dependencies recursively.

(11:48:59 SGT) starfall87: the only way I can think of is apt-geting the file, but that is not that useful I guess

(11:49:28 SGT) pcman: starfall87: yes is there any other way to 'query' only?

(11:49:43 SGT) starfall87: pcman: not that I can think of

(11:49:46 SGT) pcman: like dpkg --something

(11:49:49 SGT) ziroday: pcman: err I used apt-rdepends ages ago

(11:49:53 SGT) pcman: ok

(11:49:56 SGT) pcman: trying...

(11:50:20 SGT) ziroday: it should be in the repo's, and then its a simple matter of doing apt-rdepends foobar

(11:50:27 SGT) pcman: I saw this on nostaples page: "This project is currently idle."

(11:50:28 SGT) starfall87: I think ziroday's idea of nostaples is not that bad either, but there does not seem to be any debs of it in debian/ubuntu, are there?

(11:50:38 SGT) pcman: no

(11:51:00 SGT) pcman: apt-rdepends rocks!!

(11:51:07 SGT) pcman: we can check dependencies easily.

(11:51:08 SGT) ziroday: starfall87: there is an unofficial deb floating around, but I wouldn't trust its quality. I'm sure if the need was acute enough we could package it

(11:51:19 SGT) johnthng: I can't even access nostaples homepage

(11:51:22 SGT) ziroday: pcman: the -d switch is helpful too

(11:51:49 SGT) starfall87: but, we would have to also maintain the package in Ubuntu as well, which if we start taking that approach, things can start to add up fast.

(11:52:31 SGT) pcman: my vote is for xsane given the minimal dependencies required.

(11:52:37 SGT) starfall87: xane +1

(11:53:04 SGT) johnthng: xsane +1

(11:53:18 SGT) elfgoh: i am happy with xsane .... ubuntu uses it too... should be fine +1

(11:53:21 SGT) ziroday: xsane +1, I'm sure alternatives will popup if we need them

(11:53:25 SGT) johnthng: nostaples future, as it's on alpha quality now

(11:53:52 SGT) ziroday: elfgoh: not for long, its up for the chop once they find a suitable alternative :)

(11:54:05 SGT) starfall87: It looks like xsane it is, now to Inkscape: I am for not including it

(11:54:20 SGT) payne1: inkscape -1

(11:54:20 SGT) elfgoh: ziroday: heh we can let them do the searching for us then

(11:54:22 SGT) pcman: inkscape -1

(11:54:24 SGT) elfgoh: -1

(11:54:27 SGT) ziroday: we already have OOo draw correct?

(11:54:33 SGT) pcman: it's an expert tool rather than a frequently used one.

(11:54:33 SGT) aluddin left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).

(11:54:38 SGT) pcman: ziroday: true

(11:54:55 SGT) johnthng: inkscape -1

(11:55:01 SGT) ziroday: -1

(11:55:13 SGT) starfall87: No inkscape it is, so it seems

(11:55:29 SGT) starfall87: Now to Gimp, I am for including it

(11:55:47 SGT) elfgoh: Yes to Gimp

(11:56:23 SGT) pcman: +1, although the GUI is aweful, it's very powerful and there is no real equivalence.

(11:56:24 <nowiki>SGT) MarioB [n=marlis_b@p57B9E1BD.dip.t-dialin.net] entered the room.</nowiki>

(11:56:33 SGT) starfall87: Hi mario

(11:56:40 SGT) pcman: but I still think that we need a simpler painting tool.

(11:56:59 SGT) Genelyk: inkscape -1

(11:57:00 SGT) johnthng: is it too heavy?

(11:57:00 SGT) elfgoh: pcman: i am wondering if there is a need for GIMP + another tool

(11:57:02 SGT) starfall87: I think that the GUI is not that bad, it reminds me of Photoshop in MacOS sortof

(11:57:03 SGT) johnthng: mtpaint?

(11:57:08 SGT) MarioB: starfall87: sorry for being late. streets closed in berlin cause of biking event

(11:57:27 SGT) starfall87: MarioB: No worries, stuff happens

(11:57:34 SGT) elfgoh: Anyone has the logs before MarioB entered?

(11:57:36 SGT) johnthng: http://mtpaint.sourceforge.net/ i saw this in macpup

(11:57:58 SGT) starfall87: I think I might have the full logs

(11:58:11 SGT) pcman: mtpaint -1. The UI is not very good.

(11:58:23 SGT) starfall87: I am not a fan of mtpaint actually, I find it more difficult than Gimp, if such a feat is possible

(11:58:24 SGT) pcman: and it

(11:58:35 SGT) pcman: it's not suitable for small screens either.

(11:58:36 <nowiki>SGT) MarioB1 [n=beijing@p57B9E1BD.dip.t-dialin.net] entered the room.</nowiki>

(11:58:49 SGT) pcman: starfall87: agree. even less user-friendly than gimp.

(11:59:20 SGT) starfall87: The only other simple paint program I can think of is gpaint, but I do not think it is much better than gimp

(11:59:31 SGT) pcman: gpaint is not good.

(11:59:40 SGT) johnthng: ok

(11:59:43 SGT) payne1: +1 gimp

(11:59:50 SGT) pcman: is there any tool which can do simple editing?

(11:59:55 SGT) elfgoh: what about http://www.cinepaint.org/ or http://www.nathive.org/ ?

(Monday 22,June,2009 12:00:03 SGT) elfgoh: I have never tried them though

(12:00:15 SGT) payne1: i have never tried them too

(12:00:29 SGT) pcman: sometimes you just want to resize the image or change the contrast. it's over-kill to using gimp.

(12:01:00 SGT) elfgoh: pcman: agree.. I am suggesting we have Gimp plus one other simpler tool

(12:01:08 SGT) johnthng: ic

(12:01:14 SGT) pcman: if the disk space is ok, two programs are ok.

(12:01:21 SGT) pcman: although this can be confusing sometimes.

(12:01:34 SGT) starfall87: cinepaint looks like the same difficulity of gimp, nathive looks alright?

(12:02:05 SGT) pcman: if you need a replacement for 'mspaint' in windows, rgbpaint is ok. lol

(12:02:08 SGT) pcman: but it's too simple.

(12:02:43 SGT) starfall87: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPFz986m2zw (nathive paint video)

(12:03:25 SGT) MarioB: starfall87: could you paste the logs here please? https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lubuntu/IRC%20Meeting%20June%2021,%202009/

(12:04:01 SGT) starfall87: mario: will do

(12:04:10 SGT) MarioB: starfall87: thanks

(12:04:38 SGT) pcman: it's not working.

(12:04:55 SGT) pcman: nathive doesn't seem to be finished.

(12:05:02 SGT) pcman: it looks like a work in progress.

(12:05:07 SGT) pcman: there is no undo/redo.

(12:05:13 SGT) pcman: and no preference.

(12:05:17 SGT) pcman: nathive -1

(12:05:19 SGT) starfall87: so it looks like we will have to wait for that, the best option may be to go with just gimp

(12:05:31 SGT) pcman: it's too primitive.

(12:05:57 SGT) Genelyk: kpaint :D

(12:06:13 SGT) elfgoh: tuxpaint?!

(12:06:45 SGT) pcman: tuxpaint -1.

(12:06:49 SGT) johnthng: tuxpaint -1

(12:06:51 SGT) pcman: the UI is too funny. :p

(12:06:54 SGT) payne1: tuxpaint for children 3-12?

(12:06:59 SGT) johnthng: this is not edubuntu mini

(12:07:09 SGT) elfgoh: heh

(12:07:14 SGT) Genelyk: kolourpaint -.-

(12:07:15 SGT) starfall87: To draw a conclusion thusfar: Include Gimp, if we can find a simple tool, include it too?

(12:07:21 SGT) pcman: ok

(12:07:46 SGT) starfall87: unfortunately, we have not really found an alternative that is viable?

(12:08:15 SGT) pcman: IIRC there are some developers trying to making derived work from GIMP which owns a simpler UI.

(12:08:20 SGT) pcman: but I forgot the project name

(12:09:30 SGT) payne1: is it this one http://awesome.naquadah.org/

(12:09:35 SGT) pcman: oops. cinepaint seems to be one of them.

(12:10:07 SGT) johnthng: GIMPshop?

(12:10:32 SGT) starfall87: I think one of the things Gimp will have going for it though is the number of Gimp tutorials and script-fu and python plugins

(12:10:50 SGT) pcman: anyway, gimp can be included.

(12:11:26 SGT) pcman: agree with starfall87. include gimp, add some alternatives later if available.

(12:11:29 SGT) payne1: sorry wrong link, I didn't go through the website

(12:11:37 SGT) starfall87: I think we should conclude that gimp is included and to table further discussion to the next meeting for an additional simple tool to allow time for people to look for one

(12:11:45 SGT) pcman: ok

(12:11:50 SGT) MarioB: pcman: +1 include gimp

(12:11:52 SGT) johnthng: Okay

(12:12:01 SGT) Genelyk: +1 gimp

(12:12:04 SGT) johnthng: +1 gimp

(12:12:04 SGT) payne1: +1 gimp

(12:12:15 SGT) elfgoh: well if anyone is interested... someone created GimPhoto.... http://www.gimphoto.com/2007/08/who.html but yea stick with Gimp for now

(12:12:18 SGT) elfgoh: +1 Gimp

(12:12:23 SGT) pcman: pdf viewer now?

(12:12:28 SGT) starfall87: Ok to Pdf viewer: options Epdfview, evince, I prefer epdfview

(12:12:37 SGT) pcman: evince+1

(12:13:01 SGT) pcman: better functionality.

(12:13:44 SGT) starfall87: I would agree that evince provides better functionality

(12:14:01 SGT) pcman: for pdfs, you don't just want to open them.

(12:14:09 SGT) pcman: you want to read the documents with it.

(12:14:25 SGT) pcman: a good viewer is important for productivity.

(12:14:27 SGT) johnthng: ya

(12:14:38 SGT) starfall87: Does epdfview do forms, I cannot seem to recall

(12:15:50 SGT) pcman: personally I use adobe reader. lol

(12:15:59 SGT) starfall87: pcman: heh

(12:16:11 SGT) starfall87: well then lets just vote here:

(12:16:11 SGT) starfall87: evince +1

(12:16:23 SGT) johnthng: adobe reader looks nicer, but bloated ...

(12:16:23 SGT) pcman: epdfview is ok for me, too.

(12:16:36 SGT) pcman: few dependencies. provides basic functionality.

(12:16:40 SGT) elfgoh: adobe reader works the best

(12:16:42 SGT) pcman: good for a default viewer.

(12:16:47 SGT) pcman: yeah that's true.

(12:16:49 SGT) elfgoh: epdfview works for me +1

(12:17:52 SGT) elfgoh: Btw sorry to sidetrack, did we discuss Bootup services manager: BUM and Composite window manager: Gcompmgr at the last meeting? I didn't find the discussion in the log and it was written in the wiki.

(12:18:04 SGT) pcman: but there is no 'copy' and the sidebar showing thumbnails in epdfview.

(12:18:22 SGT) pcman: elfgoh: oops, seems to be forgotten.

(12:18:26 SGT) starfall87: elfgoh: there is no alternative for those programs so we did not discuss those

(12:18:30 SGT) pcman: let's discuss them after pdf, ok?

(12:18:45 SGT) pcman: starfall87: xcompmgr or gcompmgr?

(12:18:56 SGT) pcman: and is BUM really needed?

(12:19:07 SGT) starfall87: pcman: you have to include both I believe, gcompmgr is just a gui frontend to xcompmgr IIRC

(12:19:14 SGT) pcman: ok

(12:19:38 SGT) ziroday: I was under the impression xcompmgr was always an experiment, and that it wasn't being devleoped anymore?

(12:19:46 SGT) ziroday: gah can't spell

(12:19:55 SGT) starfall87: hold these thoughts

(12:20:03 SGT) starfall87: we must conclude on the pdf viewer

(12:20:03 SGT) pcman: can we finish pdf first?

(12:20:11 SGT) pcman: evince +1

(12:20:18 SGT) pcman: epdf lacks some important stuff.

(12:20:18 SGT) starfall87: evince +1

(12:20:19 SGT) Genelyk: lol

(12:20:24 SGT) Genelyk: +1 evince

(12:20:30 SGT) elfgoh: evince +1

(12:20:40 SGT) johnthng: evince +1

(12:20:56 SGT) pcman: conclusion? evince?

(12:21:00 SGT) starfall87: yup

(12:21:02 SGT) starfall87: ok

(12:21:05 SGT) starfall87: now to BUM

(12:21:08 SGT) pcman: ok, bum

(12:21:10 SGT) starfall87: Include BUM?

(12:21:12 SGT) pcman: BUM -1.

(12:21:28 SGT) pcman: general users can break their system easily with this.

(12:21:32 SGT) pcman: it's an expert tool.

(12:21:40 SGT) elfgoh: pcman: I think BUM is important for people who wish to managed their services but do not wish to use the CLI

(12:21:52 SGT) pcman: elfgoh: you can install it with apt-get

(12:22:13 SGT) pcman: what if a user turn gdm off in it?

(12:22:20 SGT) Genelyk: what is BUM?

(12:22:22 SGT) starfall87: I agree with the issue to new users and turning stuff off randomly

(12:22:25 SGT) pcman: he/she won't be able to get back to the desktop.

(12:22:36 SGT) pcman: it's not for general users.

(12:23:06 SGT) pcman: and what if the user turns off HAL accidentally?

(12:23:10 SGT) pcman: many things will be broken.

(12:23:21 SGT) starfall87: I think anyone who should be messing around with BUM can easily do sudo apt-get install bum or w/e

(12:23:21 SGT) pcman: so, this should not be included by default.

(12:23:35 SGT) pcman: this can be documented on the wiki.

(12:23:37 SGT) johnthng: it's too dangerous to include

(12:23:39 SGT) elfgoh: pcman: well actually if I was the end user I wouldn't dare turn off stuff i am not familiar with

(12:23:45 SGT) pcman: we can have a start page suggesting some good software.

(12:23:48 SGT) elfgoh: But I agree that it can be dangerous

(12:24:08 SGT) pcman: for beginners or experts, but I don't think this should be included by default.

(12:24:12 SGT) Genelyk: and if not have internet, how install tool?

(12:24:33 SGT) pcman: Genelyk: installer cd.

(12:24:48 SGT) pcman: Genelyk: maybe the package can be included in the cd but not installed by default.

(12:24:51 SGT) starfall87: Genelyk: Using that logic, you would end up with a distro with every package from the repo installed

(12:24:58 SGT) pcman: it's too dangerous.

(12:25:04 SGT) Genelyk: ....

(12:25:46 SGT) starfall87: so in conclusion, do not include BUM

(12:25:54 SGT) pcman: any objection?

(12:25:59 SGT) elfgoh: ok BUM -1

(12:26:05 SGT) johnthng: don't include bUm, no objection BUM -1

(12:26:29 SGT) pcman: then xcompmgr?

(12:26:40 SGT) starfall87: ok I would like to offer an alternative to xcompmgr

(12:26:43 SGT) pcman: xcompmgr +1, looks pretty. lol

(12:26:52 SGT) Genelyk: -1 BUM

(12:27:12 SGT) pcman: starfall87: what alternative?

(12:27:18 SGT) pcman: btw, do we have gcompmgr in ubuntu?

(12:27:27 SGT) starfall87: some way to install compiz fusion

(12:28:09 SGT) starfall87: because one problem with xcompmgr is that it does not provide a very smooth experience if you have it set to load on start

(12:28:20 SGT) starfall87: (I experimented with that for U-lite

(12:28:39 SGT) pcman: I loaded it on start.

(12:28:44 SGT) pcman: it works well here.

(12:29:07 SGT) starfall87: I alway got a grey-screen stuck between GDM and pcmanfm taking over the desktop

(12:29:13 SGT) starfall87: and some flicker

(12:29:20 SGT) pcman: starfall87: HW issue?

(12:29:50 SGT) starfall87: pcman: I do not know, compiz/kwin4 works without issue on same computer

(12:29:56 SGT) pcman: ok

(12:30:10 SGT) starfall87: but if you report no problems, I would be all for including it

(12:30:13 SGT) pcman: xcompmgr -1 by default since it does has some problems.

(12:30:20 SGT) pcman: AndrewLee has some problems with it, too.

(12:30:24 SGT) starfall87: ahh

(12:30:41 SGT) starfall87: I am not sure how maintained it is anymore with compiz fusion coming on so strong

(12:31:00 SGT) elfgoh: well i was thinking include it, but do not enable by default?

(12:31:02 SGT) pcman: but it works great if you only need shadows for windows.

(12:31:18 SGT) pcman: elfgoh: good. it can be turned on with xsession-edit.

(12:31:25 SGT) johnthng: ya, if you want to make it pretty, enable?

(12:31:31 SGT) pcman: just add a desktop file to autostart.

(12:31:38 SGT) johnthng: otherwise without it, you can still work

(12:31:42 SGT) pcman: but it's hard for the users to find it.

(12:32:15 SGT) johnthng: must depend on hardware

(12:32:20 SGT) pcman: but given the minimal dependencies it has, I agree with including it.

(12:32:33 SGT) johnthng: should majority of hardware work, we should use it

(12:32:49 SGT) starfall87: I was using nvidia/nvidia proprietary drivers if it has problems with that, it has lots of problems

(12:32:52 SGT) pcman: more testing is needed.

(12:33:24 SGT) pcman: I use ati open source driver since the proprietary one doesn't support my radeon mobility x1400.

(12:33:38 SGT) AndrewLee: include it in testing imageto get more test

(12:33:46 SGT) pcman: and if I install the older versions manually, it doesn't work on my ubuntu.

(12:33:58 SGT) pcman: AndrewLee: agree.

(12:34:08 SGT) pcman: but maybe it should be turned off by default?

(12:34:13 SGT) starfall87: pcman: offtopic, you need to use an older kernel to get the older versions to build

(12:34:27 SGT) starfall87: I think we should include it, off by default

(12:34:29 SGT) pcman: ok, be back on the xcompmgr issue.

(12:34:39 SGT) pcman: +1, include but off by default

(12:34:56 SGT) AndrewLee: Should have a script to detects if RENDER enabled

(12:35:05 SGT) payne1: +1, include but off by default

(12:35:11 SGT) elfgoh: +1, include but off by default, more testing needed

(12:35:24 SGT) pcman: conclusion?

(12:35:27 SGT) starfall87: we might be able to use the wrapper to compiz from Ubuntu, which checks to see if composite is supported

(12:35:29 SGT) johnthng: +1, include, need more testing to decide

(12:35:40 SGT) pcman: then next one is music player.

(12:35:57 SGT) pcman: ok?

(12:36:03 SGT) AndrewLee: starfall87: Good idea

(12:36:11 SGT) johnthng: the problematic ones might be onboard chipset

(12:36:12 SGT) elfgoh: ok let's move on

(12:36:16 SGT) starfall87: absolutely, one app not listed is Pradga

(12:36:16 SGT) johnthng: ok move on

(12:36:24 SGT) pcman: aqualung +1

(12:36:25 SGT) starfall87: one music player that is

(12:36:27 SGT) MarioB: ok

(12:36:29 SGT) pcman: anyone has tried it?

(12:36:41 SGT) starfall87: I have, it is actually a branch of Consonance

(12:36:52 SGT) starfall87: that will get bugfixes

(12:36:52 SGT) johnthng: aqualung

(12:36:54 SGT) johnthng: !

(12:37:03 SGT) payne1: i tried it, good +1 aqualung

(12:37:06 SGT) pcman: agualung: written in pure C, lightweight, gtk+ only, no gnome deps, fully-functional, UI similar to lxmusic.

(12:37:10 SGT) johnthng: i've tried it since few years ago

(12:37:22 SGT) pcman: but it has some issues with pulse audio on ubuntu.

(12:37:35 SGT) Genelyk: xmms2 ?

(12:37:38 SGT) johnthng: and also it has some plugins and it makes music better

(12:37:47 SGT) pcman: pulse seems to continue the playback for several seconds even after I stopped it in aqualung.

(12:37:50 SGT) ***elfgoh just use vlc for music and video

(12:37:50 SGT) johnthng: but are we using pulse audio?

(12:38:01 SGT) elfgoh: s/use/uses/

(12:38:07 SGT) pcman: rhythmbox doesn't have this problem.

(12:38:09 SGT) payne1: xmms auto shutdown when I load too many songs

(12:38:31 SGT) pcman: Genelyk: xmms2 is conole only. a good GUI frontend is needed.

(12:38:38 SGT) starfall87: have we considered sonata?

(12:38:48 SGT) pcman: starfall87: mpd + python GUI.

(12:38:50 SGT) starfall87: major con: written in python

(12:38:55 SGT) elfgoh: lol looks like we have a lot of opinions for music player

(12:39:02 SGT) pcman: starfall87: looks good, but mpd has some problems.

(12:39:11 SGT) johnthng: i know

(12:39:12 SGT) pcman: running as root.

(12:39:19 SGT) elfgoh: Is vlc suitable?

(12:39:22 SGT) johnthng: audacious

(12:39:23 SGT) johnthng: :)

(12:39:24 SGT) pcman: can only load music files from specified dir.

(12:39:28 SGT) starfall87: I created a package for mpd that can work without running as root, perhaps we could create a mpd-nonroot

(12:39:34 SGT) pcman: johnthng: good too.

(12:39:44 SGT) johnthng: audacious is quite good, work with pulseaudio quite well

(12:39:46 SGT) pcman: personally I prefer aqualung once the problems with pulse can be solved.

(12:40:04 SGT) pcman: it even supports tabs.

(12:40:04 SGT) starfall87: Am I the only one who has tried Pragda?

(12:40:22 SGT) pcman: not in ubuntu.

(12:40:26 SGT) pcman: finding a screenshot.

(12:41:11 SGT) pcman: no luck.

(12:41:14 SGT) starfall87: http://pragha.wikispaces.com/

(12:41:41 SGT) starfall87: Also a C/GTK+ app

(12:42:01 SGT) pcman: UI looks clean.

(12:42:20 SGT) pcman: downloading...

(12:42:34 SGT) starfall87: My only complaint with Aqualung is the two window approach, but I prefer the rhythmbox/music library style of program

(12:42:47 SGT) starfall87: afk one second

(12:43:16 SGT) johnthng: but rhythmbox has too much windows

(12:43:23 SGT) pcman: not able to compile pragha

(12:43:36 SGT) pcman: johnthng: doesn't like rhythmbox. poor performance.

(12:44:03 SGT) johnthng: and people dun look at music player too long

(12:44:15 SGT) johnthng: a simple interface like audacious is enough usually

(12:44:34 SGT) johnthng: but for managing is another case

(12:44:56 SGT) pcman: yes.

(12:45:09 SGT) starfall87: I like one app for both tasks, manageing and playing, but I play with a large library playlist so I find programs like audacious very lacking

(12:45:09 SGT) pcman: managing music files with audacious is not quite easy.

(12:45:26 SGT) pcman: compiling pragha

(12:45:28 SGT) AndrewLee: i'd like to use rhythmbox library style program to manage my musics

(12:45:44 SGT) starfall87: pcman: what build error did you get?

(12:45:51 SGT) pcman: solved.

(12:46:12 SGT) johnthng: pcman: yes I agree, but other management jukebox might be slow

(12:46:22 SGT) pcman: it needs libao, libasound2-dev, libflac

(12:46:36 SGT) pcman: any other suggestions?

(12:47:03 SGT) johnthng: another light one, is the traditional alsaplayer?

(12:47:51 SGT) starfall87: alsaplayer is not too bad in reguards to that style of player, but they still pose problems to large libraries of music

(12:48:31 SGT) pcman: any other alternatives?

(12:48:37 SGT) starfall87: I do not know how we are going to be able to draw some conclusion out of these

(12:48:59 SGT) pcman: pending?

(12:49:04 SGT) pcman: jump to next?

(12:49:11 SGT) AndrewLee: video player

(12:49:26 SGT) starfall87: that is what I am thinking, to allow time to have people try ones

(12:49:26 SGT) starfall87: who is for tableing music player

(12:49:36 SGT) ***elfgoh whispers vlc evilly

(12:49:42 SGT) johnthng: pending ... if hyperair is here, he will recommend banshee

(12:50:00 SGT) johnthng: vlc, gxine?

(12:50:02 SGT) Genelyk: vlc is good

(12:50:21 SGT) starfall87: I think mplayer and its default interface might be the best choice

(12:50:23 SGT) pcman: vlc is good

(12:50:26 SGT) hyperair: johnthng: BANSHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

(12:50:28 SGT) pcman: smplayer+1

(12:50:33 SGT) hyperair: banshee++

(12:50:36 SGT) Genelyk: :O

(12:50:41 SGT) Genelyk: smplayer

(12:50:41 SGT) pcman: banshee is good, but it's slow sometimes. lol

(12:50:41 SGT) AndrewLee: banshee looks good

(12:50:43 SGT) elfgoh: johnthng: you asked for it

(12:50:45 SGT) starfall87: pcman: what do you think of just mplayer

(12:50:56 SGT) Genelyk: smplayer or vlc ?

(12:50:59 SGT) starfall87: banshee will haul in gnome and mono

(12:51:01 SGT) pcman: starfall87: the default UI of mplayer is not user-friendly enough.

(12:51:10 SGT) johnthng: quod libet, lxde fedora use it

(12:51:18 SGT) elfgoh: I like vlc as it does not require me to install additional codecs

(12:51:19 SGT) pcman: personally I use vlc most of the time, and it's the only one having best support to dvd menu.

(12:51:25 SGT) elfgoh: I think mplayer does

(12:51:29 SGT) pcman: however, for low end machines, mplayer is the best one.

(12:51:44 SGT) elfgoh: what about gxine?

(12:51:55 SGT) pcman: elfgoh: mplayer can let you navigate the dvd by using mplayer menu.

(12:51:57 SGT) AndrewLee: smplayer uses qt

(12:52:01 SGT) pcman: but the original menu in the dvd is not used.

(12:52:08 SGT) pcman: AndrewLee: qt is not an issue.

(12:52:16 SGT) starfall87: I think we should avoid qt if possible

(12:52:17 SGT) pcman: AndrewLee: the GUI of smplayer is quite good.

(12:52:30 SGT) pcman: starfall87: why? it's not very big.

(12:52:32 SGT) AndrewLee: gnome-mplayer's UI is good too

(12:52:40 SGT) elfgoh: pcman: i haven't watched dvds with vlc before so can't comment

(12:52:44 SGT) hyperair: i heard gstreamer recently got good dvd menu support

(12:52:50 SGT) pcman: hyperair: really?

(12:52:54 SGT) hyperair: yep

(12:53:00 SGT) starfall87: pcman: I think it is hard to get qt to look like gnome programs, and it is just another lib to load into memory

(12:53:02 SGT) pcman: anyway, mpalyer doesn't support that.

(12:53:08 SGT) hyperair: hmm it doesn't?

(12:53:13 SGT) pcman: starfall87: qgtkstyle does.

(12:53:26 SGT) pcman: starfall87: does it much better than the gtk-qt theme for gtk.

(12:53:36 SGT) pcman: starfall87: qt programs looks 99% similar to gtk+ ones with it.

(12:53:41 SGT) pcman: starfall87: and the performance is good.

(12:53:44 SGT) AndrewLee: ogle

(12:53:47 SGT) hyperair: hear hear

(12:53:54 SGT) starfall87: pcman: I am talking about things like the menus at the top of the window has the rounding of qt where gtk does not, etc, but I am insanely picky about that stuff

(12:53:57 SGT) johnthng: yes, but qt menu looks different

(12:54:00 SGT) hyperair: i have qgtkstyle packaged and installed on my system

(12:54:03 SGT) hyperair: from svn

(12:54:12 SGT) hyperair: the menu and the scrollbar looks a little different

(12:54:14 SGT) pcman: starfall87: try qgtkstyle first.

(12:54:16 SGT) hyperair: but otherwise it looks pretty much the same

(12:54:21 SGT) AndrewLee: for DVD player with menu support => ogle

(12:54:35 SGT) hyperair: ogle eh.. never heard of that one

(12:54:46 SGT) pcman: AndrewLee: but it only plays DVD, IIRC.

(12:54:47 SGT) johnthng: ogle, i heard it long time before ...

(12:54:55 SGT) johnthng: wow that's uite old

(12:55:04 SGT) hyperair: anyway regarding the media player, i agree that banshee is a little heavy, and the next best would be quod libet imo. it's pretty damn lightweight.

(12:55:17 SGT) hyperair: and yes i know it's python blah blah big memory and all

(12:55:34 SGT) starfall87: hyperair: I actually found ql to be a little awkward, but maybe that was just me

(12:55:41 SGT) pcman: hyperair: both of them are good.

(12:55:43 SGT) hyperair: yeah i found it a little awkward too.

(12:55:48 SGT) Genelyk: Lxde = fasted and ligth

(12:55:49 SGT) pcman: not stable enough on my box.

(12:55:54 SGT) AndrewLee: ogle is lite

(12:56:00 SGT) pcman: ql crashes for several times.

(12:56:05 SGT) pcman: on my laptop.

(12:56:13 SGT) starfall87: but in terms of video player, I think if we are going to haul in qt, then VLC is the best choice

(12:56:34 SGT) MarioB: +1

(12:56:59 SGT) pcman: agree

(12:57:16 SGT) johnthng: +1

(12:57:16 SGT) pcman: since vlc is using qt4, no matter you use smplayer or vlc, you'll need qt.

(12:57:33 SGT) pcman: smplayer +1 for the UI.

(12:58:05 SGT) starfall87: I think though that vlc's familiarity is nice, most people I know even use vlc on windows

(12:58:12 SGT) johnthng: smplayer +1

(12:58:24 SGT) elfgoh: vlc +1

(12:58:28 SGT) johnthng: vlc ui can be customised

(12:59:03 SGT) starfall87: heh some people voted for both

(12:59:03 SGT) pcman: johnthng: any better frontend than the default one?

(12:59:05 SGT) Genelyk: uhm

(12:59:17 SGT) Genelyk: vlc is fasted ? vs smplayer ?

(12:59:27 SGT) elfgoh: pcman: http://www.videolan.org/vlc/skins.php

(12:59:32 SGT) hyperair: vlc's slower than mplayer

(12:59:44 SGT) hyperair: i use mplayer for playing videos, because it's really smooth for HD videos

(12:59:52 SGT) elfgoh: seems like there are a lot of skins for vlc

(01:00:05 SGT) pcman: performance of mplayer is better.

(01:00:30 SGT) pcman: but the default UI is worse.

(01:00:37 SGT) pcman: so I suggest smplayer.

(01:01:01 SGT) starfall87: one problem will be that if you install mplayer and a frontend, you get both in your menus

(01:01:07 SGT) pcman: but vlc with a good skin is acceptable.

(01:01:18 SGT) pcman: starfall87: it's easy to fix with a desktop file.

(01:01:19 SGT) elfgoh: can vlc serve as a music player too?

(01:01:30 SGT) pcman: yes, but not a very good one.

(01:01:39 SGT) pcman: not better than windows media player.

(01:01:41 SGT) pcman: lol

(01:01:43 SGT) starfall87: I do not think that they offer the library management dedicated programs do

(01:02:06 SGT) starfall87: so can we see a vote on vlc vs smplayer?

(01:02:20 SGT) pcman: let's vote.

(01:02:41 SGT) Genelyk: Audacious

(01:02:48 SGT) elfgoh: vlc +1

(01:02:55 SGT) MarioB: vlc +1

(01:02:55 SGT) pcman: Genelyk: video player now.

(01:02:57 SGT) pcman: smplayer +1

(01:02:59 SGT) Genelyk: jeje

(01:03:01 SGT) Genelyk: sorry

(01:03:08 SGT) payne1: vlc +1

(01:03:09 SGT) johnthng: smplayer +1 (because the interface is more straightforward)

(01:03:35 SGT) starfall87: vlc +1

(01:03:45 SGT) hyperair: vlc--

(01:03:51 SGT) hyperair: smplayer++

(01:04:17 SGT) pcman: 3:3, pending?

(01:04:30 SGT) starfall87: I count 4:3

(01:04:46 SGT) Genelyk: uhm

(01:04:49 SGT) Fred__: vlc ? vlc++ : smplayer++

(01:04:53 SGT) hyperair: pcman: i think windows media player is far better than vlc for playing music, by the way

(01:04:56 SGT) starfall87: yeah

(01:05:26 SGT) Genelyk: vlc play 3gp ?

(01:05:29 SGT) AndrewLee: smplayer +1

(01:05:33 SGT) elfgoh: Genelyk: yes

(01:05:34 SGT) starfall87: 4:4

(01:05:36 SGT) hyperair: vlc doesn't use the standard set of codecs =\

(01:05:36 SGT) pcman: vlc: starfall87 + elfgoh + MarioB + payne1 - hyperair = 3

(01:05:38 SGT) Genelyk: vlc +1

(01:05:51 SGT) hyperair: come to think of it, mplayer doesn't eitehr

(01:05:53 SGT) AndrewLee: mplayer supports more formats

(01:05:54 SGT) pcman: it's acutally 4:4 now.

(01:05:55 SGT) hyperair: but vlc uses qt.

(01:05:57 SGT) starfall87: pcman: we are not doing minuses, or you can count my vote as a minus if you want

(01:06:04 SGT) hyperair: oh and mplayer has better subtitle support

(01:06:29 SGT) pcman: maybe it's not the right time for conclusion since it's controversial now.

(01:06:31 SGT) starfall87: smplayer also uses qt

(01:06:33 SGT) Fred__: pcman, you forget me ..

(01:06:34 SGT) pcman: no concensus.

(01:06:36 SGT) johnthng: http://smplayer.sourceforge.net/

(01:06:40 SGT) johnthng: see the interface

(01:06:43 SGT) pcman: Fred__: you ++ for both.

(01:06:46 SGT) johnthng: more straightforward for user

(01:06:49 SGT) hyperair: eh? smplayer uses qt?

(01:06:53 SGT) pcman: hyperair: yes

(01:06:55 SGT) hyperair: isn't there another mplayer gui?

(01:06:58 SGT) Fred__: pcman, i prefer vlc++

(01:06:59 SGT) hyperair: other than gmplayer

(01:07:00 SGT) pcman: both of them use qt

(01:07:11 SGT) pcman: hyperair: gnome mplayer, but it's not quite good.

(01:07:25 SGT) Fred__: pcman, if (vlc==NULL) mplayer++

(01:07:26 SGT) pcman: and both smplayer and vlc have windows versions.

(01:07:41 SGT) hyperair: hmm

(01:07:43 SGT) Genelyk: smplayer http://smplayer.wiki.sourceforge.net/Changelog+0.6.xx

(01:07:48 SGT) pcman: suggestion: put this issue later.

(01:07:54 SGT) hyperair: mmhmm

(01:07:55 SGT) Genelyk: (Last updated 28/02/2008)

(01:08:01 SGT) pcman: trying smplayer and several different skins of vlc.

(01:08:04 SGT) starfall87: table video player, any objections?

(01:08:08 SGT) hyperair: Chihiro strongly discourages the use of vlc =p

(01:08:09 SGT) pcman: agree

(01:08:21 SGT) pcman: I'd like to try more vlc skins.

(01:08:35 SGT) elfgoh: VLC 1.0.0 approaches next week

(01:08:37 SGT) elfgoh: supposedly

(01:08:40 SGT) johnthng: okay kiv

(01:08:42 SGT) johnthng: ?

(01:08:45 SGT) elfgoh: maybe that will swing the vote :p

(01:08:47 SGT) hyperair: kiv?

(01:08:49 SGT) MarioB: please dont forget that many people use vlc on windows - we make it easy for them to switch

(01:08:52 SGT) pcman: elfgoh: ok

(01:08:54 SGT) johnthng: keep in view

(01:09:03 SGT) pcman: MarioB: smplayer has windows version, too.

(01:09:04 SGT) starfall87: I agree with mariob on that point

(01:09:12 SGT) pcman: MarioB: there are some users, too.

(01:09:21 SGT) hyperair: but smplayer's more lightweight =O

(01:09:26 SGT) hyperair: i mean mplayer

(01:09:37 SGT) pcman: yes.

(01:09:44 SGT) elfgoh: I vote for vlc as it can play all the formats i throw at it, not necessary for mplayer

(01:09:46 SGT) pcman: it can play movies smoothly on older machines.

(01:10:03 SGT) pcman: so, can we discuss this later?

(01:10:09 SGT) starfall87: it is tabled

(01:10:22 SGT) MarioB: pcman: many applications have windows version, but VLC is among many people a kind of standard and i have good experience with it. different issues e.g. screen resolution etc. VLC always works when others seem to fail

(01:10:22 SGT) starfall87: next is Music Ripping

(01:10:22 SGT) starfall87: I suggest Asunder

(01:10:48 SGT) pcman: MarioB: many windows users are actually using windows media player.

(01:11:02 SGT) hyperair: elfgoh: there are formats mplayer can't play?

(01:11:05 SGT) pcman: starfall87: asunder is good.

(01:11:16 SGT) pcman: hyperair: mov and rmvb

(01:11:22 SGT) hyperair: ah

(01:11:23 SGT) pcman: IIRC

(01:11:25 SGT) elfgoh: hyperair: yes there was. can't remember though

(01:11:27 SGT) hyperair: wait, are you sure rmvb doesn't work?

(01:11:30 SGT) hyperair: i used mencoder on it

(01:11:32 SGT) pcman: not able to play by default.

(01:11:43 SGT) elfgoh: I think 3gp format cannot be played by mplayer when i tried last year

(01:11:49 SGT) MarioB: pcman: Windows media player did not play everything and annoys people with pop ups and automatic online connections. many people switched already.

(01:11:55 SGT) hyperair: afaik, vlc was the one unable to play rmvb, which was why i had to pass the whole set of rmvbs i downloaded once through mencoder to get avis

(01:12:03 SGT) hyperair: s/afaik/iirc

(01:12:03 SGT) starfall87: We are going to move forward with some of the other decisions we need to make and discuss this further in the next meeting

(01:12:08 SGT) johnthng: yes

(01:12:13 SGT) johnthng: next application

(01:12:21 SGT) pcman: ok, let's move on to ripper first.

(01:12:21 SGT) MarioB: ok

(01:12:21 SGT) johnthng: we will see vlc 1.0 and also skin

(01:12:23 SGT) johnthng: k

(01:12:23 SGT) hyperair: mmhm

(01:12:27 SGT) starfall87: Asunder, I suggest we include

(01:12:32 SGT) elfgoh: moving on

(01:12:38 SGT) johnthng: rubyripper, the secure ripper

(01:12:39 SGT) johnthng: :)

(01:12:45 SGT) hyperair: grip

(01:12:58 SGT) hyperair: actually sound juicer's pretty awesome too

(01:13:02 SGT) starfall87: there is also sound-juicer

(01:13:20 SGT) hyperair: better yet, let's just get a media player that can rip

(01:13:22 SGT) johnthng: ruby Ripper has Sophisticated error correction mechanism :)

(01:13:30 SGT) hyperair: e.g. banshee, rhythmbox, (does quot libet do ripping?)

(01:13:55 SGT) pcman: for the users, having a software specialized for ripping is good.

(01:13:55 SGT) Genelyk: windows 7 include most formats in reproductor media

(01:14:19 SGT) johnthng: rubyripper, recommended from Hydrogenaudio :)

(01:14:22 SGT) pcman: just one click, and you got all songs in other formats.

(01:14:59 SGT) johnthng: http://wiki.hydrogenaudio.org/index.php?title=Rubyripper = comparable to EAC on Windows

(01:15:44 SGT) Genelyk: I love ffmpeg :D.

(01:15:45 SGT) johnthng: but if need multi language might not be too good

(01:15:55 SGT) johnthng: ffmpeg is nice, but gui?

(01:15:58 SGT) starfall87: http://littlesvr.ca/asunder/ I like asunder's ui more than rubirip

(01:16:30 SGT) Genelyk: winff

(01:16:44 SGT) Genelyk: http://winff.org/html_new/

(01:16:52 SGT) starfall87: http://www.burtonini.com/computing/screenshots/sj-main.png sound juicer also nice

(01:17:47 SGT) Genelyk: uhmmmm one problem ... all aplicationes thats incluyed in Lubuntu have support and updates ?

(01:18:21 SGT) pcman: Genelyk: if we're going to include them, we'll need to maintain them.

(01:18:29 SGT) pcman: if there is a package in ubuntu.

(01:19:04 SGT) pcman: rubyripper is not user-friendly enough IMO.

(01:19:12 SGT) starfall87: pcman: agreed

(01:19:31 SGT) ***elfgoh doesn't use any ripper software and so shall abstain

(01:20:02 SGT) hyperair left the room (quit: Nick collision from services.).

(01:20:09 <nowiki>SGT) hyperair [n=hyperair@ubuntu/member/hyperair] entered the room.</nowiki>

(01:20:16 SGT) pcman: any other alternatives?

(01:20:22 SGT) starfall87: I think it is down to soundjuicer vs asunder?

(01:20:25 SGT) johnthng: pcman: agreed, but it's the best available alternative for EAC, but maybe this one is for geeks to install

(01:20:43 SGT) pcman: and how about i18n?

(01:21:17 SGT) pcman: sound jucier vs asunder, any others?

(01:21:42 SGT) johnthng: others is by puppy

(01:21:48 SGT) johnthng: i dun think we should use that

(01:22:18 SGT) johnthng: ripoff , i dun think it's being maintained ...

(01:22:57 SGT) Genelyk: uhmmm

(01:23:49 SGT) pcman: asunder+1

(01:23:57 SGT) starfall87: asunder +1

(01:24:01 SGT) pcman: simple UI

(01:24:05 SGT) johnthng: although i use grip at times

(01:24:27 SGT) johnthng: asunder +1

(01:24:34 SGT) payne1: asunder +1

(01:24:41 SGT) Genelyk: +1 asunder

(01:24:56 SGT) starfall87: Asunder it is I believe

(01:25:01 SGT) johnthng: yes

(01:25:07 SGT) pcman: done?

(01:25:33 SGT) starfall87: ok How much longer should we hold this meeting? we are 25 minutes over

(01:26:18 SGT) johnthng: i think we started late 

(01:26:26 SGT) pcman: true

(01:26:26 SGT) starfall87: we did though

(01:26:48 SGT) starfall87: perhaps we should finish multimedia?

(01:26:59 SGT) pcman: agree

(01:27:26 SGT) pcman: any objections?

(01:27:27 SGT) johnthng: no need video editing software?

(01:27:45 SGT) pcman: do we need one installed by default?

(01:27:52 SGT) johnthng: no

(01:27:58 SGT) Genelyk: not

(01:27:58 SGT) payne1: I don't need it

(01:28:04 SGT) elfgoh: windows has windows movie maker

(01:28:09 SGT) pcman: it's not ubuntu studio.

(01:28:21 SGT) Genelyk: movie maker is very easy and util

(01:28:24 SGT) pcman: elfgoh: do we have a equivalent tool?

(01:28:33 SGT) elfgoh: I think in this day and age.. editing videos becomes more common place

(01:28:33 SGT) Genelyk: lubuntu != ubuntu studio

(01:28:40 SGT) starfall87: Agreed

(01:28:53 SGT) pcman: lubuntu != ubuntu stdio, IMHO.

(01:29:02 SGT) elfgoh: pcman: Well i haven't found a good video editor to be honest

(01:29:02 SGT) starfall87: and windows does not even include movie maker by default

(01:29:21 SGT) pcman: elfgoh: if there is a good one, including it is no big deal.

(01:29:33 SGT) pcman: personally I use avidemux, but it's not a 'movie maker' like app.

(01:29:43 SGT) elfgoh: starfall87: really? I found movie maker in the XP pc in school a few years ago

(01:30:00 SGT) johnthng: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Screenshot_of_OpenShot.png

(01:30:15 SGT) pcman: maybe not including video editing tool by default until we find a good one is acceptible.

(01:30:17 SGT) johnthng: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenShot_Video_Editor

(01:30:21 SGT) elfgoh: well i think http://www.pitivi.org/wiki/Main_Page is like movie maker

(01:30:21 SGT) Genelyk: movie maker == not :( in linux

(01:30:25 SGT) elfgoh: but it is still basic

(01:30:44 SGT) pcman: oh the screenshot looks ok.

(01:30:49 SGT) MarioB: i think video editor is not a priority at the moment

(01:30:51 SGT) starfall87: elfgoh: I believe they have moved that to the Live program that they have, which is not included by default, but I could be mistaken, I do not make movies

(01:31:11 SGT) johnthng: more advanced is http://lives.sourceforge.net/index.php?do=screenshots

(01:31:19 SGT) pcman: anyway, I don't think this should be installed by default.

(01:31:20 SGT) johnthng: but users - advanced? no ...

(01:31:21 SGT) ***AndrewLee off to bed&

(01:31:38 SGT) johnthng: -1 to be included

(01:31:48 SGT) pcman: personally I have difficulty using LIVES.

(01:31:49 SGT) starfall87: pcman: I agree

(01:31:55 SGT) starfall87: -1 to be included

(01:32:01 SGT) pcman: I have no idea how to use it.

(01:32:08 SGT) elfgoh: LIVES was too advanced for me too

(01:32:17 SGT) pcman: as a programmer, I don't know how to use it. So, it's not for my parents.

(01:32:18 SGT) pcman: lol

(01:32:42 SGT) pcman: and pitivi?

(01:33:07 SGT) Genelyk: pitivi ?

(01:33:17 SGT) johnthng: http://www.pitivi.org/wiki/Main_Page

(01:33:29 SGT) Genelyk: :o.

(01:34:02 SGT) elfgoh: i haven't tried this latest release yet

(01:34:25 SGT) Genelyk: support , import of video cam ?

(01:35:28 SGT) pcman: well.

(01:35:32 SGT) Genelyk: well

(01:35:36 SGT) pcman: seems that we don't have a good app for this now.

(01:35:37 SGT) starfall87: can we hold an include vote

(01:35:37 SGT) elfgoh: well the last release in Dec last year had yet to have an undo function

(01:35:39 SGT) Genelyk: is simple

(01:36:10 SGT) johnthng: http://www.openshotvideo.com/ looks good to me, ... but i don't think should include in lightweight distro

(01:36:22 SGT) pcman: can we include no video editing now?

(01:36:30 SGT) MarioB: +1

(01:36:32 SGT) johnthng: until we have additional space or so

(01:36:35 SGT) johnthng: +1

(01:36:50 SGT) starfall87: +1

(01:36:53 SGT) elfgoh: ok +1

(01:37:05 SGT) MarioB: ok, lets move on to recording

(01:37:11 SGT) pcman: audacity -1

(01:37:18 SGT) starfall87: -1

(01:37:19 SGT) pcman: it's not working with pulse.

(01:37:20 SGT) MarioB: do we need it? i use it to make audio blog

(01:37:23 SGT) payne1: -1

(01:37:28 SGT) pcman: it's a good program, but it doesn't work anyways.

(01:37:51 SGT) pcman: using oss emulation can make it partially work.

(01:38:06 SGT) pcman: but audacity works with pulse in fedora. so it might be a ubuntu bug.

(01:38:22 SGT) MarioB: pcman: ic

(01:38:39 SGT) pcman: but, -1 since it's not frequently needed by most users.

(01:38:45 SGT) MarioB: pcman: any other suggestion? if not leave it out and proceed

(01:38:59 SGT) Genelyk: -1.

(01:39:00 SGT) pcman: MarioB: no, but the current one doesn't work correctly.

(01:39:04 SGT) pcman: so, -1 definitely.

(01:39:06 SGT) johnthng: -1

(01:39:08 SGT) MarioB: ok

(01:39:09 SGT) MarioB: next

(01:39:12 SGT) MarioB: Webcam

(01:39:24 SGT) pcman: no webcam for testing here.

(01:39:24 SGT) starfall87: Include Cheese?

(01:40:00 SGT) Genelyk: not

(01:40:11 SGT) Genelyk: web cam for ?

(01:40:17 SGT) starfall87: I think it has questionable usibility

(01:40:28 SGT) johnthng: cheese ?

(01:40:30 SGT) starfall87: mostly webcams are used for things like skype

(01:40:38 SGT) johnthng: nowadays most netbooks and laptops has webcam

(01:40:40 SGT) pcman: cheese--------

(01:40:40 SGT) Genelyk: much client not support cam

(01:40:47 SGT) pcman: it depends on gnome-desktop in ubuntu.

(01:40:55 SGT) pcman: libgnome-desktop

(01:41:04 SGT) pcman: wait

(01:41:22 SGT) pcman: this might not necessarily result in many gnome deps.

(01:41:39 SGT) pcman: ok, acceptible.

(01:41:43 SGT) pcman: only libgnome-desktop

(01:42:52 SGT) johnthng: Cheese +1 include

(01:43:33 SGT) Genelyk: -+

(01:43:37 SGT) elfgoh: +1

(01:43:41 SGT) pcman: looks ok

(01:44:56 SGT) pcman: any objections?

(01:45:21 SGT) starfall87: no objections here

(01:45:46 SGT) starfall87: if there are no objections, include cheese and end meeting officially

(01:45:59 SGT) MarioB: ok good

(01:46:00 SGT) pcman: +1

(01:46:05 SGT) pcman: thanks guys.

(01:46:14 SGT) pcman: let's try out some music players.

(01:46:26 SGT) MarioB: so, we still have to cover a few things in the next meeting f) Internet g) Office h) Accessories

(01:46:27 SGT) pcman: Pragha looked good, but it's not finished yet.

(01:46:38 SGT) pcman: just compiled and tried it.

(01:46:53 SGT) johnthng: when's next meeting?

(01:46:56 SGT) pcman: MarioB that's the easier parts.

(01:47:11 SGT) pcman: or maybe we can use mailing list? and no meeting is needed.

(01:47:12 SGT) MarioB: there a lot of things to do

(01:47:20 SGT) MarioB: i suggest in one week

(01:47:23 SGT) MarioB: next sunday

(01:47:26 SGT) starfall87: log saved, will upload in ~30 minutes (gotta eat), will update wiki shortly

(01:47:31 SGT) MarioB: ok

(01:47:33 SGT) johnthng: mailing list hard to poll

(01:47:34 SGT) pcman: starfall87: thanks

(01:47:40 SGT) pcman: johnthng: true

(01:47:47 SGT) pcman: maybe forum?

(01:48:00 SGT) pcman: then we don't need a time for everyone to sit here.

(01:48:01 SGT) Genelyk: one moment

(01:48:14 SGT) Genelyk: return in 10 min

(01:48:16 SGT) Genelyk left the room.

(01:48:22 SGT) starfall87: I think we should discuss on the forum or mailing list, but we should hold a meeting in a week or two

(01:48:24 SGT) elfgoh: AndrewLee: pcman you guys may wish to update Dave if you all decide to use the seed method insted of UCK to build the isos

(01:48:29 SGT) johnthng: hmm ya

(01:48:58 SGT) elfgoh: https://wiki.kubuntu.org/Xubuntu/Development/Build

(01:49:05 SGT) MarioB: there is the linuxtag this week in Berlin. There will be lots of developers. If there is any important issue for us and you know of a developer who is here. Please let me know and we (maces and me) can try to speak to them

(01:49:38 SGT) MarioB: otherwise, I suggest next Sunday 28, same time

(01:49:45 SGT) starfall87: agreed

(01:49:55 SGT) pcman: ok

(01:49:57 SGT) payne1: ok

(01:50:01 SGT) pcman: but I'll be late.

(01:50:15 SGT) pcman: feel free to just start the meeting if I'm not there.

(01:50:20 SGT) starfall87: ok

(01:50:21 SGT) johnthng: ok

(01:50:25 SGT) starfall87: later guys

(01:50:30 SGT) starfall87 left the room.

(01:51:31 SGT) pcman: see you

(01:51:34 SGT) pcman left the room (quit: "Leaving.").

(01:51:37 SGT) MarioB: ok thanks to everyone!

(01:51:55 SGT) MarioB: meeting logs are here https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lubuntu/IRC%20Meetings

(01:51:57 SGT) MarioB: bb
