Bug reports should be filed regarding the hybernation/suspension problem.

It might be possible in the nearer future to get the modem to work.  See comments below.

==== Notes ====

'''Linux Kernel:'''  2.6.24-19-generic

'''Installation:''' The LiveCD does work for Me I used the Live CD Burnt to a DVD though using NTI Recorder that came with Vista on the computer  (also a CD works just fine)

'''Modem:''' The internal modem is of type "11c11040", and is currently
only supported under '''one''' special linux kernel (2.6.21.0-22) found
at http://linmodems.technion.ac.il/packages/ltmodem/11c11040/.  This
kernel does not work on the Acer Extensa 4420.  For details, consult
http://linmodems.technion.ac.il/packages/ltmodem/11c11040/11c11040.txt.  There has been a lot of activity regarding this type of modem on the linmodems discussion list during June 2008, so maybe a solution will be found.

'''PC Card Modem:''' I succeeded to make a Zoom V.92 PC Card modem (Model
3075, the one with an "L" in the serial number) work, after resolving
both an IRQ conflict (more below) and a modem initialization error
(caused by the modem command ATZ issued by wvdial).  Details are in my
message of June 20 2008 to the linmodems discussion list
http://linmodems.org/cgi-bin/ezmlm-cgi?1:mss:30607:200806:nphomakhiknjlaigopja
(Subject: "PC Card Modem: resolved interrupt conflict and modem
initialization problem").

'''IRQ Conflict:''' Both the PC Card modem and "nsc_ircc"
used irq 3.  It seems nsc_ircc is used by module irda, which must be
the driver for the infrared port.  I got rid of this irq conflict by
"black-listing" both irda and nsc_ircc, see my message to the
linmodems discussion list.
