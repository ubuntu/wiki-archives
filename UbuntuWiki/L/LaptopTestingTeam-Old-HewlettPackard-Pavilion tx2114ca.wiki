==== Notes ====
^1^ 3D requires use of NVidia proprietary driver.

^2^ Requires editing of /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf adding options snd-hda-intel model=hp to get MIC and headphone jack detection to work. Mute button works but does not change colour.

^3^ Works out of the box except mute button either changes colour incorrectly or not at all when pressed. [Light dos not change at all in Jaunty.]

^4^ Yes once alsa-base.conf is edited and system is rebooted. Volume needs to set in mixer with all mixer controls activated.

^5^ Works out of the box.

^6^ Needs access to Internet to download Broadcom proprietary driver. It was a little flaky getting the driver activated in the hardware applet, but once activated, it worked fine. Multiple reboots were required.

^7^ I got a Bluetooth mouse to work (Logitech MX1000) but not the matching Keyboard. Keyboard not yet tested with Karmic.

^8^  Using libfprint, the fingerprint reader works but it is flaky. This is a software issue.
