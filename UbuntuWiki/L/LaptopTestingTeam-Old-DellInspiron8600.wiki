==== Notes ====
* 1 - 3d-acceleration will work if you chose the "nVidia GeForce4 ti 4200 Go"  or "ATI MOBILITY RADEON 9600" (Dell systems are configurable)

Additional Options need to be added to the /etc/X11/xorg.conf for the side scroll to be activated. Note the default Option values for an Alps touchpad will be different from synaptics because of the difference in sensitivity of the two devices.
Works by default in "Feisty"

* 2 - both hibernate and sleep will fail with nvidia X driver unless this changes are made to /etc/X11/xorg.conf:

Option          "NvAGP" "1"

and these to /etc/default/acpi-support:

SAVE_VBE_STATE=false

POST_VIDEO=false

HIBERNATE_MODE=platform # this isn't needed, but Dell Inspiron 8600 supports this way of hibernation

In Hardy (and possibly other releases, though I only tested it in Hardy), hibernate and sleep both work with the proprietary nVidia driver if the file '/usr/share/hal/fdi/information/10freedesktop/20-video-quirk-pm-dell.fdi' is modified to include '8600' at the end of the key that contains '8500'.

* 3 - Modem reports as a SmartLink, but it's in fact Conexant - doesn't work with smartlink drivers (provided by Ubuntu), but works with commercial Linuxant drivers.

'''Suspend Fix'''
Uncomment "ACPI_SLEEP=true" in '/etc/default/acpi-support'

Find "# kopt=root=/dev/hda1 ro" in '/boot/grub/menu.lst' and add "nolapic" so that the line is:

"# kopt=root=/dev/hda1 ro nolapic" (Keep it uncommented)

Fn Key + Esc correctly suspends the laptop after uncomment the line above.

* 4 For systems that use a Dell TrueMobile 1300 wireless card with a Broadcom 4306 chipset, the card does not appear to be configured properly out of the box, though it can be made to work with some tweaking. In Hardy, the b43 driver works quite well, once the proper firmware is downloaded.
