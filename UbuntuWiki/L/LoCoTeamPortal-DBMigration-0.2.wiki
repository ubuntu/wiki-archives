Steps to migrate the loco-directory database from 0.1.x to 0.2.x

# Replace 0.1.x code with 0.2.x code
# Update settings.py with changes made to settings.py.sample (include 'south', 'events' and 'venues' in INSTALLED_APPS, plus OPENID_LAUNCHPAD_TEAMS_MAPPING stuff)
# ./manage.py syncdb (creates tables for south)
# ./manage.py migrate teams 0001 --fake (get south caught up with the 0.1 teams)
# ./manage.py migrate (run the migration to the 0.2 teams, creates venues and events)
