==== Notes ====
* This laptop needs to have acpi=off set in the boot command otherwise the NIC is not detected and the laptop emits anoying whining sounds throught the speakers.

This NIC not being recognised problem is fixed in the 2.6.14 kernel and the noise can be fixed by setting max_cstate to 2.  See http://www.thinkwiki.org
 
* The tpb (thinkpad buttons) package works well and is worth installing.
* With APM, Suspend does not  work properly and causes the system to freeze on resume.  Actually it seems only the keyboard and mouse are frozen, other facilities seem to work, but without a keyboard or mouse it is pretty hard to tell. Xorg uses about 80% cpu and conky (the software I use to monitor what is happening) about 20% cpu after resume.
* I use a D-Link DWL650 wireless NIC and while not part of the core laptop, it works but really needs the wlan-ng pcmcia drivers to work properly.  Ubuntu leaves these out and configures the card to use orinoco drivers, which for this card don't work very well at all.
