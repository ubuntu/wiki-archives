==== Notes ====
Webcam works with <nowiki>[[[http:--lsb.blogdns.net-ry5u870-|ry5u870 driver]]</nowiki>]
Generally laptop works very well with ubuntu

===== External monitor =====
It works by running nvidia-settings and changing it on the fly.
With driver from 100.14.19 (gutsy) it works with shortcut key too [fn]+F4.

===== Hibernate & Sleep =====
After multiple sleep-wakeup, laptop may not wake up... displaying a black screen and is unresponsive over network. I tried to update bios as it said fixing some problems of this kind, but no luck. Still investigating ...

* Feisty Final:
If compiz is disabled, hibernate and sleep works as intended!

* Gutsy:
Sleep/hibernate works if compiz is enabled too but there are some times it pc locks. This is sovled and tested by new nvidia drivers 169.xx.xx but still beta!
If you sleep/hibernate and a removable disk is attached, after wake up, it will warn about unsafe removal and will remount disk.
