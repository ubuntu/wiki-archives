==== Notes ====

====== 3D Acceleration ======
To activate 3D 3D Acceleration, the correct driver will be needed, by using the Feisty's RestrictedDriversManager to install the ATI Radeon Xpress 200M graphic card driver.
====== Hardware volume switch ======
Volume switching does work, but the little blue screen at the upper left, that is supposed to show the volume bar is corrupted.
====== Card reader(s) ======
I have only tested SD Cards at this moment, and do work.
====== FN + F5 ======
The little blue screen on the top that is supposed the show the information about the status of the battery and wireless network, and version of BIOS is corrupted. It is not visible correctly, reason I put ''No'' as the answer.
====== FN + F8 ======
Switching LCD brightness does work, but the little blue screen at the upper left, that is supposed to show the brightness bar is corrupted.
