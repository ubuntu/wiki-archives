==== Notes ====
No problems so far,  very stable.  With the noted exception of screen resolution/refresh rate, most things work out of the box.

==== Notes Xubuntu ====
I'm very happy with Xubuntu edgy 6.10

It was along time sens install, I head same nots for
https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+bug/40568
and
https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+bug/40973
Bute I'm not shore if I did need to do that.
