==== Notes ====
WLAN : I use ath5k driver, but it's not very stable. When it works, the led switch from red to blue. I didn't manage to make madwifi work, nor ath9k. It seems to me that VirtualBox OSE made the Wifi interface fail : wifi went back around the time I uninstall VirtualBox OSE. 

Graphics : I use NVIDIA 185 driver. I had to disable gnome's graphics enhancements. But 3D is okay (World of Padman works great). 

Hibernate/Suspend : I had problems with 9.04 (couldn't recover, had to reboot), I didn't try on 9.10
Sometimes the shutdown doesn't work (it worked always in 9.04 but not in 9.10).

External screen : I had problems. I only saw part of the screen. Maybe the external device could not display enough pixels. I haven't tried to change my resolution.
