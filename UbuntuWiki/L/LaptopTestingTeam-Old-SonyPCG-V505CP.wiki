==== *Notes ====

* 1 Add sonypi module. Install the package spicctrl. Install rsjog with custom key bindings. Search Ubuntu forums for details.
* 2 Use ALSA + mixer for sound in all programs. <nowiki>[[http://www.sabi.co.uk/Notes/linuxSoundALSA.html#appConfig|Instructions]]</nowiki>
* 3 some things don't work after awakening.
* 4 after installing with the wifi on.
* 5 Playing DVD's with Totem gave error. <nowiki>[[http://www.seismo.ethz.ch/linux/sony_vaio_t1xp_linux.html|Solution]]</nowiki>
* 6 enabled cpu scaling because fan was on too much. Installed emifreqd and emifreq + cpufreq applets.
* 7 have to send essid and bring interface up manually.xubuntu has no network gui along.

It took me a few days to setup to my liking but all in all ubuntu is now working very nicely and I seldom boot into XP anymore :)

=== Breezy Issues ===

* Sound not working in some programs, i.e. Skype

New breezy clean install from boot is running sweetly and better than hoary(or breezy dist upgrades)

=== Dapper Issues ===

Oops Partition Muckgick(& I) f*up my WinXP. Ah well time to leave the nest and fly with two linux os's instead ;)
