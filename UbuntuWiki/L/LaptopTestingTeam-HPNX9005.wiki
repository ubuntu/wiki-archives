=== Current Issues ===

- Edgy testing done with the official release
 
- Dapper testing done with the official release

- Breezy testing done with the official release

 
- ATI Radeon Mobility U1 (IGP320M) driver fails to support MergedFB but works with 3d acceleration in Edgy 

- 3 out of 5 hotkeys are not recognized: from the row of 5 above the keyboard 1st and 3rd from the left work, but 2nd, 4th and 5th fail. (Both Hoary, Breezy and Edgy) In "keyboard shortcuts" the two give output and the three wont.

==== Notes ====
===== Touchpad =====
The default settings may need to be tweeked to get the expected results due to the extended touchpad with a separate area for vertical scrolling.
A RightEdge value of 5900 seems to be about right - add it to xorg.conf and enable SHMConfig as below. Tested in Feisty.
