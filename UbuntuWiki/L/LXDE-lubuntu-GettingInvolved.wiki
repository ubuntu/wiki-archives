== Introducing Lubuntu Team ==

Lubuntu as an idea came into being in 2009. It has a dedicated set of developers who ensure that Lubuntu goes from strength to strength. You may be wondering how long it took to become a fully adopted member of the Ubuntu family? Lubuntu became a full member of the Ubuntu family in late 2011. Lubuntu has proved itself and gained the official title by the efforts of its members, teams and all the help of Lubuntu users, Ubuntu-family users, Canonical, and many, many individuals.

With the amazing growth of Lubuntu itself, the project really needs more people to help out. You are here because you like Lubuntu and care about it. Your support and contribution are highly appreciated and needed.

== Where to Contribute ==
There are many areas where you can contribute and help Lubuntu with. Choose whatever you like the most. ALL help and contributions are highly appreciated and more than welcome.

== How to get started ==
This is the most asked question after reading all the above. Assuming you have made your choice of which one of the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lubuntu/SubTeams | Sub-Teams of Lubuntu]]</nowiki> you would like to join. Also, assuming you have already joined <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/lubuntu-users | Lubuntu Mailing List]]</nowiki> and did all the steps/requirement mentioned previously, you are good to go. All what you need to do is:

# Send a new email to the mailing list to introduce yourself with a link of your Wiki Page.
# Send a request to join one (or more) of <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lubuntu/SubTeams | the Sub-Teams of Lubuntu]]</nowiki> that you are interested about and think you fit the most in. The Head of that sub-team will approve your request as soon as he/she will receive it. However, it is strongly recommended to contact the Head of the Sub-Team that you wish to join before to make yourself known :)
# If you have a Social Network Account, join <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lubuntu/ContactUs | Our Social Networks Areas]]</nowiki>
