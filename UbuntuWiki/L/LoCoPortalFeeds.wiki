__TOC__

== Proposed Ubuntu LoCo Portal Blog Feeds ==

We have now built support into loco.ubuntu.com for LoCo Team feeds. We are looking for a list of blog feeds that discuss things specifically related to your team or the wider LoCo community. This could include topics such as:

* Events your team is organizing or running.
* Future project goals and achievements.
* New assets you have created (such as websites, flyers, stickers).
* Photos of you team activities, events, and more.
* Reporting experiences, ideas, and concerns about your team and the wider LoCo community.
* . . .

If you want to get your blog on the list of blogs on loco.ubuntu.com you need to:

* Be an approved LoCo team, OR
* Have a blog feed that only discusses Ubuntu LoCo Team topics (you can have a category RSS feed for this, for example).
* please email the loco council once you have added your blog entry to the list.

To get your blog on there, propose it in the table and the LoCo Council will review this list periodically.

=== Getting Your Feed Ready ===

Please ensure that the feed that you provide only contains posts about your LoCo Team.

If you have a blog that covers a lot of topics, please set up a category for the LoCo Team and provide the RSS for that specific feed. As an example, if you use wordpress and have a 'ubuntu-loco-team' category, your feed would be at http://www.example.org/category/ubuntu-loco-team/feed/

=== Feeds ===

''Please provide both the users LP name and the team LP name.''
