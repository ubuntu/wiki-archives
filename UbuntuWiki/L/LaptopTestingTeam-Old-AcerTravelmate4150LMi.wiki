=== Current Issues ===

As of Dapper Drake (6.06), this laptop works very well with Ubuntu.

Unfortunately, the fan is very noisy (but it's not specific to Linux).

==== Installing Breezy ====

The TM4150 has IDE drives (DVD and HDD) on an Intel ICH6 SATA Controller, which can work in ''combined mode'' (IDE and SATA). This caused a lot of troubles for installing Ubuntu Hoary and Breezy on it, because the DVD drive wasn't recognized (neither Live CD not Install CD did work). The solution was to install Warty and then upgrade to Breezy.

Also, DMA on both DVD and HDD drives couldn't be enabled because the kernel was using the generic IDE driver. The kernel had to be patched and rebuild in order to get DMA working. There were two solutions, see <nowiki>[[http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/showthread.php?s=&postid=1756151|this thread]]</nowiki> on linuxquestions.org about that if you are interested.

I haven't been able to boot on Breezy's 2.6.12 kernel (problem with pivot root...), so I stuck with Hoary's 2.6.10 patched kernel (I haven't got the time to find an issue).

These problems have been solved in Dapper!

==== Installing Dapper/Edgy/Feisty/Gutsy/Hardy ====

Steps to install Ubuntu from Dapper to Hardy on this laptop:
* Insert the install CD, boot on it;
* Install the system, reboot at the end of the installation process;
* Enjoy!

Don't need to pass any extra parameter to kernel for installation. All goes fine.

==== Notes ====

=== 3D Acceleration (for Edgy/Feisty/Gutsy) ===

If you don't use screen rotation, you can speed up the 3D rendering by setting the `INTEL_BATCH` environment variable. In your ~/.bashrc, add the line:
<pre>
export INTEL_BATCH=1
</pre>
It will enable batch buffer codepath for OpenGL apps. Note that it isn't really safe with rotation.

It speeds up glxgears from 774 fps to 1014 fps.

=== Card reader ===

SD under Feisty does not work. No other cards tested. dmesg does not show any hotplug event. Therefore I assume, there is no cardreader kernel module available.

The card reader can take xD-Picture, MS, MS PRO, MMC, SD and SM cards. The xD-Picture card is not supported (and will probably not be supported for some time, since it's a proprietary format). Other cards haven't been tested.
