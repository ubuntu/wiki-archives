==== Notes ====
* two error messages are always reported during bootup with recent kernel versions 2.6.15-xx-k7. I have pasted the relevant lines from syslog:

localhost kernel: [4294669.668000] PCI: Cannot allocate resource region 7 of bridge 0000:00:05.0

localhost kernel: [4294669.668000] PCI: Cannot allocate resource region 8 of bridge 0000:00:05.0

* it appears to be related to the ATI chipset. potentially relevant output from lspci:

0000:00:00.0 Host bridge: ATI Technologies Inc RS480 Host Bridge (rev 01)

0000:00:01.0 PCI bridge: ATI Technologies Inc: Unknown device 5a3f

0000:00:05.0 PCI bridge: ATI Technologies Inc: Unknown device 5a37

0000:00:13.0 USB Controller: ATI Technologies Inc IXP SB400 USB Host Controller

* but what is this "0000:00:05:0/unknown device 5a37"?
