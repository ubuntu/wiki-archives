== Introduction ==
The '''Documentation Team''' is a group of community volunteers responsible for creating, writing, editing, and updating the Lubuntu Wiki and the Documentation related to Lubuntu.

== Two Focuses ==
Under the Wiki & Docs Team, we are working on two areas that are linked in terms of what they contain, but use different methods to deliver that information:

=== Wiki ===
This are is focused on the Wiki area. Our task is to make sure all pages are updated and that the information suits all kinds of needs, for all kinds of users.

* <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/Documentation | A full list of Lubuntu Documentation]]</nowiki>.

=== Manual ===
This area is focused on building, updating and maintaining a manual dedicated to our own distribution. As a variant of the Ubuntu Manual, one can find this one very similar. The overall goal is to create a document that can be viewed online, downloaded or ordered as a book for future reference.

== Lubuntu Wiki & Docs Standards ==
Because Lubuntu is an easy and simple lightweight system, the Wiki area should also reflect that. Therefore, there are some standards we are following with each and every page. Please note that we have so many pages and lack of manpower and volunteers to update the Wiki area could explain why some pages are still complicated but we are working on that.

Wiki Pages must be:
# Simple
# Informative
# Direct to the point
# As short as possible
# Up-to-date

== Feedback ==
Is the wiki faulty or incomplete? Please email the Lubuntu wiki-docs mailing list.https://launchpad.net/~lubuntu-wiki-docs
