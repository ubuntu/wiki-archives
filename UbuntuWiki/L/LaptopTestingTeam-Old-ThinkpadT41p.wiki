==== Notes ====
* : 3D acceleration is working with the non free drivers, but when using them suspend to ram and disk are not working.

* *: Could not possibly work as not implemented in Gnome.

* **: Installation of the fglrx drivers using the exact procedure presented here: http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2005/10/24/Ubuntu-T42p-Video#c1130164338

* ***: At boot time, if the lid of the laptop is open, the external screen is not used. If the lid is closed, the external screen is used. The resolution is automatically adapted from 1440x1050 to 1280x1024 (my current external screen resolution).

* 5: Needed to enable PCM in the volume control.
