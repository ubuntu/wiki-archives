==== Notes ====
(I) The APT section of the installer hangs at about 25%. I got around it by skipping the apt section. If you do this you will need to edit your /etc/apt/source.list file to use apt later.

(II) 3D acceleration is does not work automatically. You need to insert the r128 module before loading X.

(III) The volume controls will work if you define the keyboard shortcuts. The shortcuts are not setup for you automatically.

(IV) The Frequency will slow down when on battery and will speed up again when on AC. This is normal behavior for Pentium III with speed step. In My case the CPU runs at 700MHz on battery and 900 MHz on AC.

(V) The system does appear to suspend correctly, but resuming does not work.

(VI) The system hibernates correctly regardless of power state. However resuming while on battery does not work. Resuming while on ac works. For this reason I have downgraded back to Hoary. (I need hibernate to work.)
