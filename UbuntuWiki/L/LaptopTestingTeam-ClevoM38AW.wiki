==== Notes ====
[1] On Breezy the screen seems corrupt when using the "nv" driver. It's ok with propetary driver.

[2] On Breezy the sound driver does not work and freezes the boot procces. <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HdaIntelSoundHowto?highlight=%28hda%29%7C%28intel%29|HERE]]</nowiki> is a partial fix (boots ok, but still no sound... maybe i did something wrong?)

[3] I did not buy that option.

[4] The Elantech touchpad it's detected as a PS2 mouse. Supports multifinger tap and vertical scroll, but not other features as corner tapping for example (or i dont know how to set them). 

[5] Only tested with memory stick
