== Testing Ubuntu on an IBM Thinkpad T43, model number 2668-Y3U ==

* Contact: GiuseppePantanetti
* Make: IBM
* Brand: Thinkpad T43
* Model: 2668Y3U
* Website: http://www-307.ibm.com/pc/support/site.wss/quickPath.do?quickPathEntry=2668Y3U

=== Current Issues ===

On Gutsy:

* X freezes after few minutes when Compiz is enabled. See <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-video-ati/+bug/108527|108527]]</nowiki>. I had to turn off 3d acceleration which is enabled in a __default__ installation!
** 3d acceleration and desktop effects can be activated using restricted ATI driver ''fglrx'' and  GL-based X server ''xserver-xgl''. Unluckily this driver doesn't permit hibernation nor suspension
* During startup splash screen is not visible (screen is completely blank). See <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/gutsy/+source/ubiquity/+bug/150930|150930]]</nowiki>.
** As a result of this issue boot process takes very long: usplash process eats all CPU resources.  
** This problem seems related only to installations made with live/desktop edition (alternate installation method isn't affected)
* Gnome Power Manager doesn't display brightness control on preferences (I had to modify gconf settings in ''/apps/gnome-power-manager/backlight/''). Brightness applet doesn't work. See <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-power-manager/+bug/134756|134756]]</nowiki>
