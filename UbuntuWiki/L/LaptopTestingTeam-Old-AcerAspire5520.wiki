=== Current Issues ===

==== Video ====

To have correct resolution and 3D acceleration enabled, you must use proprietary drivers by choosing: System > Administration > Hardware Drivers and enabling "NVIDIA Accelerated Graphics Driver" option.

==== Audio ====

The internal microphone provided with Crystal Eye webcam is not working neither under Ubuntu 8.04 (Hardy) nor under currently developed Intrepid.

With old kernel 2.6.24-19 the microphone jack was working, but with kernel 2.6.24-21 it's not working either.

See <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/269294|bug #269294]]</nowiki>

==== Wireless ====

Inegrated ethernet wireless controller (Atheros Communications Inc. AR242x 802.11abg) is not supported by madwifi-hal drivers provided in Ubuntu 8.04.1, you can manually install a newer version as explained on <nowiki>[[http://madwifi.org/ticket/1192|madwifi.org]]</nowiki> to fix this.

Note that in or

You can download latest snapshot of madwifi drivers (0.10.5.6) from <nowiki>[[http://snapshots.madwifi.org/madwifi-hal-0.10.5.6-current.tar.gz|here]]</nowiki>. This will give you latest revision available. Tests have been performed with revision 3861, that you can eventually download from <nowiki>[[http://snapshots.madwifi.org/madwifi-hal-0.10.5.6/|here]]</nowiki>, but newer revisions should work as well.

Unpack the tar file with sources into a folder called madwifi, open a terminal, cd into the folder you just created and execute following commands (those preceded by # are comments and must not be ignored):

<pre>
sudo su

apt-get install build-essential perl
apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)

ip addr

ip link set ath0 down
ip link set wifi0 down

cd scripts
./madwifi-unload
./find-madwifi-modules.sh $(uname -r)
cd ..
make make install
depmod -ae
modprobe ath_pci
</pre>

Wait a while and the wireless should start to work. If not, reboot your laptop.

The fix appears to be incorporated into Intrepid, but this has not been tested. See <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/224498|bug #224498]]</nowiki>

==== Wireless activity LED ====

Wireless LED does not work properly. This can be tweaked as explained <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AspireOne#Step%203:%20Tweak%20/%20Fix|here]]</nowiki>.

Open a terminal and execute these commands:

<pre>
sudo su
sudo chmod a+x /etc/rc.local
gedit /etc/rc.local
</pre>

Add these lines just above the string exit 0 (below doesn't work).
<pre>
sysctl -w dev.wifi0.ledpin=3
sysctl -w dev.wifi0.softled=1
</pre>

Save and reboot.

The 2.6.27 kernel does not appear to have these options anymore (earlier kernels do).
