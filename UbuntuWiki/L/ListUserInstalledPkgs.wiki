=== Summary ===

* Launchpad Blueprint: <nowiki>[[https://blueprints.launchpad.net/shove/+spec/list-user-installed-pkgs]]</nowiki>
* Author: Akshay

Outputs a list of all packages installed after the default OS installation. The idea is to take the list of installed packages on the old system and diff it with the packages installed on the new system, the remaining packages were installed by the user and thus must be added to the new system.

=== Design ===

Must support rpm, dpkg and slackware package queries.
