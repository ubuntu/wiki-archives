==== Notes ====
I used a Linksys PCM100 PCMCIA network card which worked perfectly.  I also was given a D-Link DWL-G630 wireless card by a friend, which worked fine, just changing the settings from within networking in Gnome.  I got the card after I installed the Breezy preview, however, so I don't know if it works as well with Hoary.
