==== Notes ====
Everything needed for daily work is running.<<BR>>
3D with ATI binary driver<<BR>>
With MSR-Tools it's possible to lower Core Voltage.<<BR>>
With a custom DSDT it's possible to alter the FAN on/off temp.<<BR>>
So you get a whole day fanless notebook.

My DSDT is available at http://acpi.sourceforge.net/ additional info at http://www.mobang.de
