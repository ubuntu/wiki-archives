==== Notes ====

1. Dual-boot installation: Windows Vista Business + Ubuntu 7.10 Gutsy Gibbon

2. In System -> Administration -> Screen and Graphics Preferences:

Screen:
* Model: LCD Panel 1280x800 (widescreen)<<BR>>
* Resolution: 1280x800@51Hz

Graphics Card:
* Driver: nvidia

May 10, 2008 update: upgrade to Hardy Heron + installation of the nVidia drivers as per http://www.funnestra.org/ubuntu/hardy/ has fixed my resolution management issues.

3. Results of 3D acceleration tests:
<pre>
$ which glxgears | xargs strings | grep benchmark | xargs glxgears
13063 frames in 5.0 seconds = 2612.487 FPS
$ glxinfo | grep rendering
direct rendering: Yes
$ lspci|grep VGA
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation GeForce 8400M G (rev a1)
</pre>

4. External monitor used during the tests: Compaq FP7317

5. With Gutsy Gibbon, when I closed the laptop lid, let the computer go to sleep mode and then opened it again, I had no wireless network; I had to turn the wireless switch off then on to restart the connection. This has been solved in Hardy Heron.
