=== Current Issues ===
Middle (blue) mouse-button (intended for "hold down to scroll") does not work. --Fixable: Just needs configuration in xorg.conf mouse section.

Initially some trouble with getting out of standby-mode (when lid closes) -- Fixed: by a supporter in IRC-channel.

When returning from heavy hibernation (Fn + F12), GRUB loads up, instead of going directly to Ubuntu, which should already be loaded? -- Not-a-bug: that's normal since the machine is turned off completely (that's how hibernate works).

Wireless Connection signals vary much more than in Windows XP.

Sound info panel (appearing when changing volume level) is perhaps not entirely correct, since I am only able to hear even the heaviest of songs from +50% (and I'm not that deaf). -- Fixable: since gnome adjusts the software volume and the bios concurrently changes the hardware volume, things are messed up. Just disable the volume keys since they will work anyway because the bios can handle everything.
