==== Notes ====

As my laptop comes with 256 MiB of RAM, it's recomended --should i say necessary-- to setup a swap partition PRIOR TO INSTALLATION if you use the live cd to install. If not done so, live cd system runs EXTREMELY slow. You can do this using any partition utility of your choice: the Install CD of Ubuntu 5.10 Breezy Badger, for instance.
This requirement is not needed if system is installed from the "Alternate Install CD".
