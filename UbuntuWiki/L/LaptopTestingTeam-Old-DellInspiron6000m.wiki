==== Notes ====
The Dapper and Edgy installs were from the DVD in Keir Thomas' "Ubuntu Linux'.
The Feisty install was from a download of the 7.04 version around July, 2007.
The Gutsy install was from the Tribe5 CD of Aug 30, 2007.

Dual boot with Windows and Feisty works well, not so well with Edgy or Dapper.  Not tested yet on Gutsy.

Gutsy tests were done in the Live CD mode, possibly that is the reason for the CPU frequency scaling (driver/monitor) icon failing to appear on the desktop.
