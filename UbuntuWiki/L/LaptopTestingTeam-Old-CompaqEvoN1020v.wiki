=== Current Issues ===
<<BR>>Unable to test docking station for Dapper, as do not have one. On install of Dapper Beta, both 8139cp and 8139too modules were loaded. This seemed to cause massive amounts of software interupts to be generated - [ksoftirqd] was sitting at around 50% cpu usage. Dropping the eth0 interface with `ip link set eth0 down`, and rmmodding both modules, then modprobing the 8139cp driver and then bringing up eth0 fixed it.

Second boot did not have these issues. On third boot all seems fine - even though both modules are loaded. Install did find network and aquire dhcp lease.

Powernowd does not work on boot. This is fixable.

==== Notes ====
Setting the numlock (by Fn+Scroll) turns on the number keypad - appears to be done in hardware, will be seen in grub if on then.

Something really odd: /proc/cpuinfo reports that one of the flags is ht - hyperthreading... on a laptop - am going to try to enable it and see what happens - dosen't work, reports being 'Disabled'. - Reason is because the config-2.6.16-20-686 file has CONFIG_X86_HT_DISABLE=y

To get powernowd working: modprobe p4-clockmod, restart powernowd
To get powernowd working better: edit line 13 of /etc/init.d/powernowd, replace
OPTIONS="-q"
with 
OPTIONS="-q -u10 -l7 -p150 -n" -not seeming to work atm, will report back later - works. Just need to wait for cpu usage to drop :)
-q = quiet
-u10 = CPU upper usage limit before upping freq
-l7 = CPU lower usage limit before dropping freq
-p150 = polling frequency in msec (default is 1 sec, which is far too slow to react to window changes that require the cpu to kick up a gear)
-n = Include nice'd processes in calculations - not sure why its there, but probably something todo with making windowing feel responsive.

Window movement seems far more snappy than on breezy. Is currently running the 686 kernel, not the stock 386 kernel.

I've used a different version of this laptop with the N1020v badge, but with different specs - 1.6GHz Celeron, 256M Ram, 30G HDD, 14" screen, touchpad has no 4 way hat switch below it, has IBM style pointing stick in keyboard + two buttons below space bar + touch pad with two buttons below that. Appeared to have same motherboard - had same network card/modem/irda/cdrw+dvd/inbuilt floppy/firewire and requisite backport. Fitted same docking bay as well.
