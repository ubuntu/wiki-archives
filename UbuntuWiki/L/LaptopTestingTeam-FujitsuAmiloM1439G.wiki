=== Current Issues (Jaunty 9.04) ===

* Sometimes, the text in some graphical applications is garbled. NVidia drivers are installed to get enhanced desktop effects. Can be fixed when it happens for example by putting the window of the application in full screen mode and then back to its original size

* Fan runs continuously and the notebook gets hotter compared to using it with Windows XP

* Video playback with VLC works o.k. but not as smooth as under Windows XP. Especially on the external monitor 1280x1024, sideways motions are not smooth.

==== Notes ====

1.  Suspend works around 90% of the time. On some attempts, suspend mode is not entered (manually or when closing the lid). Instead Jaunty goes back to the password screen. Also resume doesn't work all the time. Similar behavior also with Windows XP so maybe this is a hardware issue.
