=== Current Issues ===

The laptop has to be plugged into docking stations on boot for anything except the power passthrough to work.
<<BR>> Most of the fn+key combos dont work

Suspend and resume work perfectly on Ubuntu 6.06 LTS (Dapper), but fails about 1 in 10 times on Ubuntu 5.10 (Breezy). If your using U5.10, use the work around given here - https://launchpad.net/bugs/38587

There is no LT modem moduels for Ubuntu 5.10 *at all*. The LT modem module is available for Ubuntu 6.06 LTS -386 kernel, but /not/ the 686 one.

If your system doesnt give you a suspend option, do the following:
<<BR>>
<<BR>>Press Alt+F2, and type in 'gconf-editor'
<<BR>>Browse to Apps -> Gnome-power-manager, and enable the 'Can suspend' option (its a tickbox)

==== Notes by original author ====
When in docking station the monitor only runs at 60hz, and whines.

* 1) Does switch into "console" (blank screen with blinking cursor), but doesn't blank the screen.

* 2) Serial port and Infrared have the same irq : if you change one with "setserial" it works fine in SIR mode.

Hello "Levulcain", please could you file a bug in the Bugzilla.  BTW, if you do `setserial /dev/ttySx uart none`, that should stop the kernel serial driver operating on that port and allow you to use the IR drivers again.  Does this work?
