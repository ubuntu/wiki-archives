=== IRC ===

General landing discussion takes place in '''#ubuntu-ci-eng''', in which queuebot will ping frequently about the progress/statuses of various silos. Landing Team Members should set an IRC highlight for "trainguards" if they want to follow when to assign or publish silos for people. Be warned though that this gets pinged frequently throughout the day.

If you need help troubleshooting a problem with CI Train, you should ping '''trainguards''' in '''#ubuntu-ci-eng'''.
