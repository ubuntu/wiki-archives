Review: http://www.onisland.ca/geek/linux/sonyvaio-fs640w

To my surprise, (almost) everything worked right out of the box.  To be honest, I was almost disappointed, as installing Linux on a laptop has always been a great way for me to learn more about the OS.  But, I'll take it when I can get it.  Good work Ubuntu!  

=== Current Issues ===
Typing 'reboot' in the console closes X, and hangs at the login.  I guess don't do that -- use the gdm logout and reboot :)

==== Notes ====
===== Sound =====
Sound was correctly configured from the start (HDA Intel), however the laptop speakers you may need to un-mute the "Front" speakers.  If you use headphones or external speakers, also un-mute headphones, and use PCM as you master (select for gnome applet).

===== Touchpad =====
Touchpad worked fine, however scroll did not.  Modified from <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=87619&highlight=alps+vaio|this post]]</nowiki> you'll probably have to do this:

edit (with sodu): 
 /etc/udev/alps.rules

add:
 BUS="serio", SYSFS{description}="i8042 Aux-3 Port", KERNEL="event?", SYMLINK="input/alps"

symlink:
 ln -s /etc/udev/alps.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/40_alps.rules

replace these in your xorg.conf under InputDevice (synaptics)!:
 Option          "Protocol"              "event"
 Option          "Device"                "/dev/input/alps"

REBOOT!

==== Not working ====

- I have been unable to get the card reader work at all, or even show up in any of the systems device profiles.
- None of Special function keys work, dmesg shows this (related or not?)

[4294842.967000] sonypi command failed at drivers/char/sonypi.c : sonypi_call1 (line 647)....

- ACPI doesn't do everything it should (dim on unplug / shutdown or battery dead), though I may have broken some of it while muckin around.
