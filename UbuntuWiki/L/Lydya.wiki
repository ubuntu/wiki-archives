Hi! My name is Lidia

=== Infos ===
I'm a young software analyst programmer and I'm trying to become a good network sysadmin.

I've been Linux's user for years (1996-97) and now I've choose Ubuntu as my favourite distribution.

I like photography and playing Dungeons-&-Dragons (with paper-&-pencil ;) ).

=== To Do ===
To contribute to translate Ubuntu&Co from English to Italian.
