=== Current Issues ===
'''Wifi''' doesn't work out of the box in Ubuntu 7.10 (Gutsy), although the restricted broadcom driver recognises the card the correct way. Using this <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx/Feisty_No-Fluff|Ndiswrapper]]</nowiki> solution, it works like a charm.

For Ubuntu 8.04 (Hardy), I had to add
<pre>
install ndiswrapper modprobe -r ohci_hcd ssb; modprobe --ignore-install ndiswrapper $CMDLINE_OPTS; modprobe ohci_hcd
</pre>
to

/etc/modprobe.d/ndiswrapper

and then following these  <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx/Feisty_No-Fluff|directions]]</nowiki>.

'''Hibernation''' didn't seem to work the first time I used it; when I tried to reproduce the error the system hibernated right away... 

Inserting a headphone doesn't mute the built-in speakers, but the headphone is functioning correctly. See below at 'notes' for the solution that worked for me.

==== Notes ====
'''Desktop Effects in Gnome'''

Desktop effects don't work because of the blacklisted video chipset (Intel GMA 965). There is a workaround available (comment-out this chipset from the blacklist)but I havn't tried that yet.

'''Sound-buttons F9 - F12'''

Sound buttons are only active when a musicplayer like rhytmbox is opened. It doesn't have to be the active program. (tested with Rhytmbox).

'''Headphone Jack Sense'''

Headphone-Jack sense (makes the built-in speakers turn off when you insert headphones) is working after I did this: (thanks to jubjubrsx in this <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=500894&highlight=headphone+jack+mute|Ubuntuform-thread]]</nowiki> :

<code>sudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base</code>

add the line

<code>options snd-hda-intel model=laptop</code>

where you see all the other options. Restart X.
