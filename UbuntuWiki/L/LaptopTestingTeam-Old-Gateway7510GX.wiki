==== Notes ====

* 1. Output of glxinfo | grep rendering:

      Unknown device ID 3150, please report. Assuming plain R300.

**** ********************************WARN_ONCE*********************************

      File r300_state.c function r300Enable line 456

      TODO - double side stencil !

**** **************************************************************************

      No ctx--FragmentProgram._Current!!

      direct rendering: Yes

* 2. Information on CPU Frequency Scaling:

      After installing the CPU Frequency Scaling Monitor applet, the processor never
      changed from 800 MHz, even on AC. This web site told how to change the processor
      speed:
      
      http://ubuntu.wordpress.com/2005/11/04/enabling-cpu-frequency-scaling/

* 3. Sound:

      Sometimes I lose sound. It seems to happen when restarting the machine. The only
      way to get it back is to turn the machine off completely. It may also happen after
      booting into Ubuntu after running Windows XP. I have not spent much time looking
      into solutions.

      This sounds like the same problem that I am having:

      https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+bug/57141

* 4. Wireless networking:

      This laptop has one of the Broadcom 4318 wireless network cards. See the output of
      lspci below for more details on the card.

      I have used both the bcm43xx and ndiswrapper modules. I think my main issues have
      been with the supporting software and not the modules themselves. At first, I was
      using the System/Administration/Networking to control my networking. Just
      connecting to my router without encryption was fine with this software.

      I then found out about NetworkManager. The only way to get this software to work
      was to disable the networking devices in System/Administration/Networking. Using
      this software, I was able to connect wirelessly with WEP only. Trying to use WPA
      would not work with NetworkManager, there seems to some issue between it and
      wpa_supplicant. Starting wpa_supplicant manually and then issuing a dhclient
      command works.
      not work
