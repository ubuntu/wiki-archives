==== Notes ====

CPU Throttling works fine when you apt-get and modprobe the p4 CPU scaling module; there is no specific code written for Celeron M processors as the same scaling architecture is shared with the P4s.

NIC connects to all DHCP networks fine.

Wifi card at time of writing does not work; by the number of posts in the forum this is a commonly unresolved problem. Can connect to unprotected networks using NDISwrapper but WPA/Xsupplicant doesn't recognize the network adaptor.
