* Make: Sony
* Brand: Vaio
* Model: VGN-FE31M
* Website: http://vaio.sony-europe.com/view/ShowProduct.action?product=VGN-FE31M&site=ite_en_GB&pageType=Overview&category=VN+FE+Series
* S/N: N/A

=== Out the box ===
* video (including 3D  after apt-get install nvidia-glx) 
* sound (including the mute, decrease and increase buttons)
* networking (including wireless)

=== Current Issues ===
* fn keys
* screen brightness (workaround: install smartdimmer or nvclock)
* touchpad has random behavior (99% works great, but sometimes stops or jumps all around)
     a. using gsynatpics enabled horizontal and vertical scrolling, which weren't working fine, disabling it corrected most of the problems, so now touchpad works great 99.99% of the time
* suspend / hibernate not working (maybe some kernel patch needed because suspend works great on Mandriva 2007)

=== Plus ===
* almost 3 hours in battery time
* beryl with AiGLX working great (with nvidia beta drivers), including with under clocking the GPU to the minimum
