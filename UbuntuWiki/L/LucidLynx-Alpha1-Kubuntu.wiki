== Introduction ==
Kubuntu will release version 10.04, the Lucid Lynx, in April 2010. This will be an <nowiki>[[LTS|LTS]]</nowiki> release, so our overall focus will be bringing a more stable and polished desktop to our users. However, this does not mean there will be nothing new or exciting. Quite the contrary! Read on for highlights of what is new and upcoming  for Kubuntu 10.04.

'''NOTE:''' ''This is an alpha (pre-) release. Pre-release versions of Lucid are '''__NOT__''' encouraged for anyone needing a stable system or for anyone who is not comfortable running into occasional, even frequent, breakage. Pre-release versions '''__ARE__''' recommended for Kubuntu developers and those who want to help in testing, reporting, and fixing bugs.' Please do not use this in a production environment with data  or workflows that you cannot do without''

As the first alpha this pre-release is at a very early stage with several notable problems.  You will need to start the installed with '''kdesudo ubiquity''' from the command line.  See Known Issues below for more.

The System Tray, Device Notifier, and KNetworkmanager are just a few of the items that will see improvements. New features such as grouping windows into tabs have been added, and new and improved widgets, effects, and configuration/ui changes are just some of the great things <nowiki>[[http://techbase.kde.org/Schedules/KDE4/4.4_Release_Goals|planned]]</nowiki> for SC 4.4.
