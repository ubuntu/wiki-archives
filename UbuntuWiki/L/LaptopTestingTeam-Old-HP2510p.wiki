==== Notes ====

- A few notes from my experience: 

  - The hardware buttons for wifi, sound, etc are really slick on this computer. Touch sensitive - and better is that they work on 7.10!

  - Flash: Flash install seems to be messed up and reinstalling doesn't change it. Finally got it working by installing from Flash site. 

  - ^3^Hibernate: Since one significant update to the distro I believe this now works most of the time. I have hibernated several times and come back to it successfully. The only thing to note is that the login screen comes back *so* dim that I often am not able to see it. I have to enter my password and then crank up brightness with keyboard. Occasionally it doesn't work at all, and when this happens, I have to unplug and take out the battery to get it to shut off (simply holding the power button doesn't work).  

  - ^4^ Card reader: No response whatsoever when using an SD card. Note that I was using a microSD in SD adapter, though that shouldn't make a difference. 

  - I had a terrible time with this laptop using 7.04 and wasted a lot of hours trying to get it working. I installed 7.10 and it was waaaay better. 7.04 wouldn't even boot. I could only get to command line after some tweaks recommended in the forums.

- notes from <nowiki>[[gorthx]]</nowiki>:

  - I did all of my testing of Hardy off the 8.04 LTS live CD.  Testing of Ibex was done on an actual install.

  - ^1^ External monitor is an HP1706.  Laptop screen resolution was correct unless the external monitor was connected; then the laptop picked up the proper resolution for the external monitor (which cut off the bottom of the laptop display).  fn+f4 (the usual key to switch between laptop screen & external monitor) did not work - display was always shown on both screens if the external monitor was connected.

  - ^2^ Hibernate functioned properly (several times) as long as I did not close the lid.  Closing the lid disabled usb mouse, touchpad, keyboard mouse & required a hard reboot (unplug & remove battery) to recover.  Have yet to try disabling the sensor as outlined below. '''update''' I found the settings to change with (without having to disable the sensor):  System -> Preferences -> Screen Saver -> Power Management: When laptop lid is closed: Do nothing. :)

  - ^5^ To find the HP bluetooth PCMCIA mouse, make sure that the mouse is fully charged (green light when it's in the slot);  pop out the kickstand;  press the connect button (with a paperclip or some such.)  You should then be able to see the mouse from the "Setup new device" option from the bluetooth gui menu.

- Other Notes

  - Close Lid: Closing the lid crashes the laptop. Here is my workaround, you can disconnect the sensor lid so when you close it nothing happen.
    To disconnect it, remove the cover where you have the power switch, touchpad on/off switch, volume... no need to  unscrew anything. You will find the sensor connector next to the power switch, it's the white connector with 2 wires.
    When disconnect, you can then close the lid for as long as you want without crashing ubuntu or the touchpad turned off.

  - Wireless: Working perfectly on Netgear DG834GT with auto-connect. Using WPA-PSK and MAC Filtering but had to Broadcast my SSID and install Wicd not Network Manager.

  -SD Card Reader: No luck with this. Any idea?
