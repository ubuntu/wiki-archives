==== Notes ====
ATI RS485M chipset. Built-in wireless is Mini PCI card (Marvell 802.11n) so it can be swapped out with a brand that works. Very good machine, runs very cool, screen is very bright. Probems with sound volume control appeared in recent (Sept. 2007) Gutsy updates and haven't been fixed yet. Despite current deficiencies, this laptop overall performs well with Linux/Ubuntu. It is potentially a good Laptop for Linux/Ubuntu because of the AMD Turion X2 and ATI Radeon 1150 IGP architecture. Xorg 3D support should occur once recently released Radeon specs are acted on.
