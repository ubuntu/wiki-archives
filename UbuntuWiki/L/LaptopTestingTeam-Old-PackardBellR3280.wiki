=== Current Issues ===
* Kubuntu 5.10 Breezy: kubuntu-5.10-install-amd64.iso
 a. Using everything by default, I obtain the following message and nothing happen:
<pre>
...
[  31.428415] io scheduler noop registered
[  31.428445] io scheduler anticipatory registered
[  31.428462] io scheduler dealine registered
[  31.428481] io scheduler cfq registered
[  31.428810] RAMDISK driver initialized: 16 RAM disks of 16384K size 1024 blocksize 
[  31.428913] NET: Registered protocol family 2
[  31.446936] input: AT Translated Set 2 keybord on ias0060/serio0
</pre>

 b. Doing: "linux vga=771 noapic"  (and optionally: DEBCONF_DEBUG=5 BOOT_DEBUG=1)

I have choose the French language and keyboard.
The automatic network configuration failed. But doing it manually is ok.
Everything else seems to be ok !!! See below for details

''Regarding ^^, could you try each of the options `nolapic`, `noapic` and `vga=771` in turn to find out what the minimum needed is.  The vga option is probably not needed as Dapper uses the native 640x400 (the same mode the machine booted in), the apic options are related to IRQ handlingand the last to are informational DEBUG settings that shouldn't affect the operation of the system in any way, just print more information'' -PaulSladen

* Kubuntu 6.04 Flight 3: dapper-install-amd64.iso
Problem while begin the default installation process:
 a. Using everything by default, I obtain the following message and nothing happen:
<pre>
kernel direct mapping tables upto ffff810100000000 @ 8000-b000
Booting the kernel.
</pre>

Changing the screen resolution:
After loading kernel, the screen stay black and nothing happen.

 b. If I try to "Install server", the installation process stop after this message:
<pre>
...
[ 210.014360] Initializing Cryptographic API
[ 210.014400] io scheduler noop registered
[ 210.014472] io scheduler anticipatory registered
[ 210.014543] io scheduler dealine registered
[ 210.014624] io scheduler cfq registered
</pre>

 c. If I try "Check CD for defects", and using everything by default, I obtain the following message and nothing happen:
<pre>
kernel direct mapping tables upto ffff810100000000 @ 8000-b000
Booting the kernel.
</pre>

* Kubuntu 6.04 Flight 5: dapper-install-amd64.iso
Problem while begin the default installation process:

 a. Using everything by default, I obtain the following message and nothing happen:
<pre>
kernel direct mapping tables upto ffff810100000000 @ 8000-b000
Booting the kernel.
</pre>

Changing the screen resolution:
After loading kernel, the screen stay black and nothing happen.

What kind of test should I perform, to understand the problem?
What should do, to get it running ?
=== LiveCD experience ===
I have use only AMD64 live CD:
* Breezy: pb.. (to be detailed - soon)
* Ubuntu 6.04 Flight 3: dapper-live-amd64.iso
Freeze at the beginning of the "installation" process. Similar to the installation CD;

Freeze at the beginning of the "installation" process. Similar to the installation CD;

* Kubuntu 6.06 LTS Release Candidate - rc.desktop amd64
Everything is ok: live CD and installation !

Note: I have tried using the final Kubuntu 6.0.6 LTS Dapper Drake release... It fails !!! So I have stored the CD from the Kubuntu 6.06 LTS Release Candidate with a lot of attention. Qtparted run's perfectly...

After installing the "Kubuntu 6.06 LTS Release Candidate" when the final release have been shiped. I have updated the packages... so I have an updated 6.0.6 Kubuntu release.
