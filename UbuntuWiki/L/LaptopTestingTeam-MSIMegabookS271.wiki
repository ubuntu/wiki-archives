=== Current Issues ===
64-bit version of ubuntu used.

Wireless LAN driver results in CPU (soft-) lockup upon usage of a WEP key in shared-key systems. I added the rt61 module (which is the wireless LAN driver) to modprobe blacklist, and I'm now trying to compile a newer driver (ndiswrapper + windows driver doesn't work, because there is no 64-bit driver available without the use of a windows-computer) To Be Continued...

Wired LAN driver doesn't initialize the device correctly at boot-time. The port is unusable (LAN switches give 'faulty connection' status). After rmmod r8169 and modprobe r8169 all works fine, strangely. 

Bluetooth doesn't work at all. I should soon create a launchpad-item for this, with the windows drivers attached, for reverse-engineering. 

Wired and wireless LAN will both get a place on Launchpad soon too, if there isn't any yet.
