__TOC__

* You want to convince a journalist to write about ubuntu and your locoteam. Why should he listen to you?
* You want to convince a for-profit corporation (Canonical or any other) to donate to your locoteam, or to sponsor it. Why should they spend their hard earned money on your locoteam? 
* This new project at your locoteam looks really effective to you. You want to motivate more volunteers to concentrate their efforts onto it. How are you going to convince them?
* After installing analytics software on your locoteam's website, you realise that more than 10% of your traffic comes from a site you had never even heard of.

How and what (not) to monitor and document about your locoteam? Documenting and monitoring your locoteam's activities can sometimes really be worth the effort. On the other hand, there is the danger of burying your locoteam in a senseless meta-effort. 

The goal of this spec is to collect practical examples of what locoteams are already monitoring. Maybe this will even provide useful to distill some best practices from.
