==== Notes ====

MichaelWood3 - For me Hibernate (which is different from suspend/standby) doesn't seem to have ever worked. Although there seems to be conflicting reports here.

----
=== Old Issues ===

I have problems with the Flight 4, and Flight 5. When Setup is installing the Xorg Server, it crashes down, and turn black the screen.
TillRettig: The problem persists on Flight 6.

When you resume from standby/sleep mode the device eth0 (or which ever is your wireless interface) dissapears, looks like this could be a bug in the ipw2100 driver as I tried reloading the module and that worked fine. Bug #39644:

PaulSladen: the machine comes with a broken ACPI DSDT ("buggy BIOS"): <pre>

patch -p0 < samsung-x05-dsdt.dsl.diff
iasl dsdt.dsl
sudo cp DSDT.aml /etc/mkinitramfs/
sudo update-initramfs -u $(uname -r)
</pre> This is great and means that suspend now works... however, the little icons in the top-left hand corner now destory the mouse pointer as they don't restore it after ''borrowing'' it.  (Press Ctrl-Alt-F1 then Alt-F7).

TillRettig: It didn't need to reasemble the DSDT -- just installing of Breezy and Dapper Flight6 gave success: Battery state was shown, Monitor- and Sound changing (fn+cursor keys) worked. Also suspend and hibernation: only the keys were not set correctly: hibernation worked only from the shutdown-menu, suspend with the hibernation-button (fn+Esc).

MichaelWood3: This was needed to get the mouse wheel and middle button to work correctly 
edit the xorg.conf and change the values for this section to look like this:
 <pre>

Section "InputDevice"
        Identifier      "Configured Mouse"
        Driver          "mouse"
        Option          "CorePointer"
        Option          "Device"                "/dev/input/mice"
        Option          "Protocol"              "ExplorerPS/2"
        Option          "ZAxisMapping"          "4 5"
EndSection

</pre>

PaulSladen:The Scrollwheel (also the middle button) is not working correctly.  Apparently it was under Breezy, so this is a regression.

TillRettig: Scrollwheel works fine under Flight6.

PaulSladen: MemoryStick carder is a Cardbus/PCMCIA device that is "plugged in" when a flash card is inserted.  No idea how to drive it.

PaulSladen: I wrote some `acpi-support` card for the VGA switching, but this might "just work" with a fixed `DSDT` anyway.  Something isn't quite right, if you set the status to `crt on lcd off`, it actually returns `crt on lcd on` when queried. 
We worked out that the card does some fancy detection on whether a monitor is plugged into the secondary vga out.

PaulSladen: Can't work out how to get the battery key (or preferably, disable the hardware status icons).  But the WWW, MAIL and TICK keys are:  <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/bugs/23165|#23165]]</nowiki>.
