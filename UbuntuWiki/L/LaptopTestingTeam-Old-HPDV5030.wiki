=== Current Issues ===
* kernels fail to boot without noapic (all versions from flight 5 to current, including installer)
* open source wireless driver for this laptop (bcm43xx) fails 
* * it appears driver is present but without firmware, by default so that's no going to work
* * installing firmware gets things closer, but still doesn't work
* ndiswrapper + shipped windows driver works on  linux-image-2.6.15-18-am 2.6.15-18.27 (/w blacklist bcm43xx) 
* ndiswrapper worked in 2.6.15-19 until around 4/1/2006, now the current kernel (linux-image-2.6.15-19-am 2.6.15-19.29) just locks the entire machine when the interface is enabled 
* fglrx (binary ati drivers) fail unless (locks machine) unless dri is disabled. i don't think 3d acelleration would work even if the driver would load, since the chipset is a 200M one, but i'm not sure. open source ati driver seemed to work okay, but i only ran it briefly
