==== Notes ====
# Sleep functionality doesn't work out-of-the-box - haven't got it going yet, but haven't spent much time on it.  Hibernate works o-o-t-b.
# Modem required installation of slmodem package - <code> aptitude install sl-modem-daemon </code> - after which it worked without configuration...  Just started the Ubuntu network configuration software and there it was.
# Added the M3N wireless module (internal Intel Pro/Wireless 2200BG), booted, and there it was in the network configuration app - no configuration needed.  Might require a second reboot after first configuration to ensure correct firmware is inserted...  
# Sat down a few nights ago and figured out how to configure Xinerama (dual headed display - extended desktop) with the i810 graphics system and Xorg.  The following is my xorg.conf:

Works great with both my ViewSonic E95 and my Philips 109s40 monitors.  Both run at 1024x768 - not sure if different resolutions between the LCD and external monitors are either possible or desirable...
