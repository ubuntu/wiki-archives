My name is Luke L., and I'm from Texas, USA. I'm studying MIS/CS at Texas Tech, and I will be graduating in May to work for a Texas-based bank and insurance firm.

=== General ===

I love Ubuntu. I use Ubuntu Server at home, I experiment with all sorts of tasks on Ubuntu. I promote it in all my Linux classes (over Fedora, heh) and have impressed people with the ease of use of tools like Byobu, FireHOL, and the great Ubuntu/Debian installer.

I have high hopes for the server distro. I need to enumerate my wishes...

I'm on IRC as lukehasnoname in the #ubuntu-server and #ubuntu-motu channels. I'm also a part of the ubuntu-server and ubuntu-devel mailing lists.
