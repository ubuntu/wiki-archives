=== Current Issues ===

All Lucid tests are as of Alpha 3.

The wireless nic only works under Lucid out of the box.  Microphone isn't currently working. There is no way currently to set the duration of the keyboard back light.  It does work however.  Win 7 can be used to turn on the bluetooth and then it will be recognized under Lucid.  I can't get further than pairing.  Bluetooth browsing doesn't work.  Audio working with patch (see bug).
