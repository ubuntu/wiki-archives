* Contact: <nowiki>[[Lorenzo]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[OttoKekäläinen]]</nowiki>
* Make: HP/Compaq
* Brand: 
* Model: HPNX9010 [P4, 2.8 GHz, Ati Radeon IGP 340M, 512 Ram,...)
* Website: http://tuxmobil.org/hp_compaq.html
* Hardware: http://hwdb.ubuntu.com/?xml=761cbe3bdd483c2a5e825fad97d2f703
 
=== Current Issues ===
* Installing  Feisty has become near impossible because of shutdown problems. '''But it works perfectly after a BIOS upgrade'''
* Hibernate (suspend to disk) does now work! (Suspend however still not: it does standby but it does not resume: blank screen and fans running fast);
* Some special keyboard keys does not work (side "mute volume" key does not work); some of them works after modifying keyboard shortcuts, like side "volume up/down" keys;
* Sometimes the network panel applet freeze the laptop when configuring wireless settings (I use ndiswrapper and a PCMCIA Wireless card); However, this has not been seen while using the Dapper-shipped driver.

==== Notes ====

* Ipaq: It does work with synce; however I had to modify the scripts because of random assignment of devices ttyUSB0 and ttyUSB1
* tvout: it works only with atitvout (laptop should boot with s-video cable plugged) and without X (Only Mplayer then...)
* ATI Radeon IGP 345M inside, works with the xorg ATI-driver
* console: external screen works if plugged in during system boot -- '''In Edgy''' External monitor works anytime switching from laptop monitor to external and viceversa. Mirroring two monitors only works with Xinerama changing your xorg.conf (this disables beryl)
* xorg: external screen activated and laptop screen deactivated if formed plugged in when X starts up (atitvout nor fn+screen-button has no effect on operation)
* tip: remove extra info from monitor-section in xorg.conf and the external monitor will be autodetected with better refresh rates. More resolutions in xorg.conf might also be added, since local screen always uses 1024x768 anyway (nice fall-back).
* IrDA: In Dapper module ali-ircc is loaded by default after installing 'irda-utlis' package, but the command 'irattach -s' takes the kernel to a complete freeze = is ALI FIR buggy? Unable to test the NSC-module (with option 0x08 for HP HSDL-3600), since the loading of ali-ircc cannot be stopped (blacklisting modules does not work). See "section 5: IrDA" on http://www.ali.com.tw/eng/support/faq_linux_os_faqs.htm
* PCMCIA can be detected, but first you need to add 'yenta-socket' to /etc/modules -- Problem not detected in '''Edgy'''
* SMART monitoring utils supported
* Wireless: with Prism 2.5, ndiswrapper is not necessary. Several wireless driver modules may be in conflict; blacklisting prism2_pci and hostap_pci (while allowing orinoco_pci) may be necessary.
