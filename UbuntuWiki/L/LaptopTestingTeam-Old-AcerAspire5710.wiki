=== Current Issues ===
The touchpad didn't work on the live version of Ubuntu 8.04, but does on installation. It's still not great though - it's extremely sensitive to the point where I'm now using a USB/wired mouse - which is fine.

The screen brightness is a problem - it's way too dark, but adding the brightness applet to the panel gets around this. Although you have to do it afresh every time you log in. Resolution is fine, though.
