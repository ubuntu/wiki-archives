==== Notes ====
^1^With Restricted Driver.
^2^Sound only plays through headphone jacks.
^3^Included remote control does not appear to work. Haven't tested other infrared devices.
^4^After resume from suspend, USB mouse needs to be re-plugged in.
^5^The button is actually the icon and is very sensitive and stubborn. I recommend not using it.
