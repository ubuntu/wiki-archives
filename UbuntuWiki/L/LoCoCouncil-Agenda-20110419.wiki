[21:01] <paultag> JanC: ping?
[21:02] <huats> paultag, he should be around since 15 minutes ago he was sending email :)
[21:02] <paultag> huats: aye :)
[21:02] <paultag> anyone have anything else, while we wait?
[21:02] <JanC> hi
[21:02] <paultag> Ah, howdy
[21:02] <paultag> JanC: the floor is yours
[21:02] <czajkowski> Aloha
[21:02] <popey> hey czajkowski
[21:02]  * paultag waves to czajkowski 
[21:03] <czajkowski> I blame my housemate for eating my internet >:(
[21:03] <paultag> czajkowski: it's OK, we're underway, JanC's got the floor just now
[21:03] <paultag> have'nt missed anything yet
[21:03] <JanC> well, ubuntu-be has some money to spend on material for publicity
[21:04] <JanC> and we wondered if Canonical would want to sell some of the things they buy for themselves (or sometimes to give away for free) to locoteams at a good price
[21:04] <YoBoY> hi
[21:05] <JanC> and at least 3 other locoteams in the mailing list found that a good idea too
[21:05] <paultag> ubuntu-cz, italy, and ecuador
[21:05] <czajkowski> JanC: like a discount code or something ?
[21:06] <JanC> I'm also thinking about things that are not in the regular store
[21:06] <JanC> like the table cloth & banner
[21:06] <popey> perhaps they _should_ sell them in the store
[21:06] <popey> and give discounts to approved teams
[21:06] <czajkowski> popey: +1 idea yes
[21:06] <JanC> we could use more of these, and other things like rollups etc.
[21:06] <huats> popey, I am sure it is a good idea for canonical to sell that in the store
[21:06] <paultag> I could see that being really useful
[21:07] <Cracknel> this sounds great
[21:07] <paultag> and I think everyone would make out fairly well from it
[21:07] <popey> would make it easier for people to buy them
[21:07] <czajkowski> JanC: so the table cloth and bannner are good examples of this
[21:07] <popey> via a legitimate store
[21:07] <huats> it is clearly soemthing aimed at large groups
[21:07] <czajkowski> can you think of anything else
[21:07] <huats> like LoCos
[21:07] <JanC> of course if they are much more expensive than making them locally it's not going to work well
[21:07] <czajkowski> we then can ask canonical would it be possible for teams to purchase these things via the store ?
[21:08] <czajkowski> JanC: of course, but the idea being they'd all be the same so more professional looking
[21:08] <JanC> that's one point indeed
[21:08] <paultag> [IDEA] Sell LoCo Conf-SWAG (such as tablecloths or banners) in their store, at a discounted rate for approved teams
[21:08] <MootBot> IDEA received:  Sell LoCo Conf-SWAG (such as tablecloths or banners) in their store, at a discounted rate for approved teams
[21:08] <czajkowski> ok so I guess what I'm wondering is
[21:08] <czajkowski> before we go to canonical and ask for this
[21:08] <czajkowski> is it just these two items
[21:08] <czajkowski> or is there anything else that springs to mind
[21:09] <paultag> +1 czajkowski
[21:09] <JanC> rollups are another thing
[21:09] <czajkowski> I dont want to go back and forth every few months asking for another rhing
[21:09] <czajkowski> rollups?
[21:09] <huats> once again putting that in the store might only put some "pollution" in the store or at least to have that in a separate category
[21:09] <popey> we should a) ask canonical if they're willing first, then b) if they are, go to loco-contacts and ask when people want most
[21:09] <popey> feed that back to canonical
[21:09] <YoBoY> czajkowski: lanyards
[21:09] <paultag> popey: +1
[21:09] <huats> popey, +1
[21:09] <popey> AIUI there were some changes afoot in the store
[21:10] <popey> so this might work well, or badly depends
[21:10] <JanC> there are lots of lanyards in the conference packs currently  â˜º
[21:10] <czajkowski> YoBoY: lanyards are already there
[21:10] <YoBoY> yes but not discounted ^^"
[21:10] <serfus> what's nice in banner and such imo is that most of the loco teams have it localize, this will cancel that
[21:10] <popey> YoBoY: anything can be discounted
[21:10] <czajkowski> YoBoY: they are also in the conference packs.
[21:10] <JanC> but selling regular store items with the discount might be nice too
[21:10] <popey> you can get vouchers for the stores
[21:11] <YoBoY> czajkowski: the conference pack don't have enought for me
[21:11] <czajkowski> serfus: not the approved ones, it's a generic one.
[21:11] <huats> serfus, I think the idea would be to find items that don't need localisation
[21:11] <czajkowski> YoBoY: france team is a bit of an unusal one :)
[21:11] <czajkowski> huats: back me up here!!!
[21:11] <YoBoY> lol
[21:11] <huats> czajkowski, no way
[21:11] <huats> standing next to YoBoY :)
[21:12] <czajkowski> ok well if you like I'll take this on as an action item
[21:12] <czajkowski> and write to jane and petra and ask them would this be even possible and report back either via next mweeing or via the mailing list
[21:12] <paultag> [ACTION] Contact Canonical about offering LoCos products in the Store
[21:12] <MootBot> ACTION received:  Contact Canonical about offering LoCos products in the Store
[21:12] <paultag> +1 czajkowski, thanks :)
[21:12] <paultag> JanC: really great idea
[21:12] <czajkowski> np
[21:13] <czajkowski> ok
[21:13] <czajkowski> is there anything else
[21:13] <czajkowski> also can I please ask all locoteams when contacting us to mail the entire team
[21:14] <czajkowski> if you mail us personally the team may miss out due to people not getting their email
[21:14] <czajkowski> pretty please :D
[21:14] <czajkowski> mail loco council mail address
[21:14] <paultag> we are in most timezones, so we get back to you faster :)
[21:15] <czajkowski> yes
[21:15] <czajkowski> exactly
[21:15] <czajkowski> does anyone have anything else ?
[21:15] <paultag> Anyone have anything they'd like to bring up?
[21:15] <JanC> BTW, czajkowski: with "rollups" I mean roll-up banners that come with a metal stand to hang them on  (Canonical has those already for internal use)
[21:15] <paultag> what Laura said :)
[21:15] <itnet7> o/
[21:15] <paultag> itnet7: you have the floor :)
[21:15] <popey> i think we (UK) call them 'pop-up' banners, but yeah
[21:15] <YoBoY> JanC: not so good, english presentation material...
[21:16] <czajkowski> JanC: grand job shall ask also
[21:16] <YoBoY> or just with Ubuntu on it a bit ?
[21:16] <huats> YoBoY, that is why I mention materials that don't need translation
[21:16] <czajkowski> YoBoY: can just be the same Ubuntu info as on banner
[21:16] <czajkowski> Ubuntu and loco.ubuntu.com o them
[21:16] <JanC> YoBoY: considering that we often have to use it in a multilingual environment anyway...   ;)
[21:17] <YoBoY> the banner have the english website, it's not a good info for me and people discovering ;)
[21:17] <huats> JanC, it is something that is not true in France (the multilingual stuff)
[21:17] <JanC> ah, but we have localised flyers etc.
[21:17] <itnet7> sorry finally got on
[21:17] <JanC> and posters
[21:17] <paultag> oh, righto
[21:17] <itnet7> was jyst saying present
[21:17] <paultag> itnet7: yessir :)
[21:18] <czajkowski> YoBoY: but if this goes into the store it's not going to be in multilanguages
[21:18] <czajkowski> it costs too much to get it done
[21:18] <JanC> the banners are more to pull attention or be visible from further away
[21:18] <paultag> we could ask for no english on it, I guess
[21:18] <YoBoY> yes I know, I don't want multilanguages stuff, I want neutral language stuff
[21:18] <paultag> with just "Ubuntu" and the logo or something
[21:18] <JanC> and to make the booth recognizable
[21:18] <paultag> and stock photos of people having fun
[21:19] <czajkowski> yes Ubuntu or loco.ubuntu.com as it's for locoteams
[21:19] <YoBoY> for example yes
[21:19] <YoBoY> it's a translated website
[21:19] <czajkowski> that's all that is going to go on these things
[21:19] <czajkowski> that makes them suitable for all
[21:20] <YoBoY> or we could ask a special website like start.ubuntu.com where users are redirect to the right website
[21:20] <YoBoY> don't know what's the best way
[21:20] <huats> YoBoY, I think we'll figure out lter
[21:21] <YoBoY> yes
[21:21] <huats> first let's ask Canonicla
[21:21] <czajkowski> we have the LD lets not go creating more websites for others to develop :)
[21:21] <JanC> "find you local team on loco.ubuntu.com"
[21:21] <JanC> but that's English again...
[21:21] <huats> and then during the many exchange we'll find the right formula to have something language neutral
[21:21] <YoBoY> just the website JanC :)
[21:22] <vojtech_t> i think just logo and ubuntu.com or loco.ubuntu.com is enough
[21:22] <czajkowski> ok
[21:23] <JanC> hi vojtech_t, you responded for the Czech team on the list IIRC ?
[21:23] <vojtech_t> JanC: yes
[21:24] <czajkowski> vojtech_t: thanks
[21:26] <vojtech_t> i think this is great idea, because we could use this materials, but it's to problematic for us to obtain them (create graphics, find a company to produce them...)
[21:26] <vojtech_t> *..too problematic...
[21:26] <JanC> vojtech_t: depends on what you have most: people to work on it or money  â˜º
[21:26] <YoBoY> same problem everywhere
[21:27] <YoBoY> huats: where we produced our last banners ? :D
[21:27] <czajkowski> vojtech_t: I've taken an action item to follow this up so will do so and get back to people
[21:27] <JanC> but there is also the scale issue, often making 1 or 2 items is relatively expensive
[21:27] <serfus> it might be easier and cheaper but i still think it's better for a loco team to have local merchandise
[21:28] <JanC> serfus: one doesn't exclude teh other
[21:28] <huats> YoBoY, Peru
[21:28] <YoBoY> ^^
[21:28] <huats> and it was really cheap
[21:28] <czajkowski> at the end of the day folks, this is really only a discussion to see if people may be interested we still need to ask canonical if it's even possible
[21:28] <serfus> JanC, in case the team is not very wealthy it does
[21:28] <czajkowski> so nothing really will be sorted till then
[21:28] <huats> we asked someone from Ubuntu Peru (nxvl) to bring it to us on a UDS
[21:29] <huats> and it costs us only 20â‚¬ for 3 banners...
[21:29] <czajkowski> yes but not everyone is in that position
[21:30] <JanC> I've been thinking it might also be useful if Canonical wanted to pay the transport cost (now often the people who have least money pay most because they live further away...)
[21:30] <JanC> that could be part of the "discount"
[21:30] <paultag> OK, I think we have had some good talk on this, and we have enough to move forward with this
[21:31] <paultag> I think we should end this topic -- does anyone else have a new topic to discuss?
[21:31] <paultag> if not, we'll close the meeting and take this to locoteams
[21:31] <paultag> once!
[21:31] <paultag> twice!
[21:31] <paultag> thrice! That's a wrap!
[21:31] <paultag> Thanks, all!
[21:31] <paultag> #endmeeting
[21:31] <MootBot> Meeting finished at 15:31.
[21:32] <JanC> yep, thanks everybody for coming & discussing  â˜º
[21:32] <serfus> âœŒ
[21:34] <YoBoY> thanks
[21:44] <highvoltage> ohno I missed loco time
[21:47] <huats> highvoltage, indeed :)
