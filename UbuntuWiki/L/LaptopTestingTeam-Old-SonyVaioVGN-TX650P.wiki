=== Current Issues ===
Testing Breezy install from scratch.  Adding Dapper Install

In Dapper Flight 4, touchpad movement is still *slow*, screen resolution is very wrong.  I have managed to "fix" both of these problems through editing the xorg.conf.  All the testing below is done on the machine with the edited conf file.

The clock bug appears to have been fixed with the upgrade to flight 4.

Positive Dapper aspects:  Sound works perfectly, and the network connections do not appear to fight each other.

==== Notes ====
1) Resolution Should be 1366x768, but came up as 1368x768.  Minor inconvenience, could be changed in screen resolution.

2) Sound works, but has "scratchy" sounding issues.  Also causes gaps when used in KDE.  This is a documented issue with the Intel HDA sound chip.

3) When wired and wireless were both on at the same time, the network driver got confused and couldn't access the internet through either.  Turning one off enabled the other to access the net.  Issue currently unknown cause.

4) I(MTK) don't have an SD Card to test, but the memory stick device does not work.

5) I(MTK) have used a bluetooth mouse with Breezy; however, there was quite a bit of semi-documented command line stuff that had to be done.  I hope dapper contains a graphical app...  Nope, not default installed... as of flight 4.

6) I(MTK) have not tested the burning capabilities of the drive under GNU/Linux.

7) I(MTK) have twice tried to hibernate, but while the shutdown appears to work correctly, the machine hangs up while booting back up.  I know I had this working in a previous Breezy install, so I do not know what is wrong.

8) Screen resolution issue is much worse in Dapper.  Max is 1024x768, and there is no setting to make it 1366x768.  This issue was "fixed" by editing xorg.conf to change the video driver to i810, and adding a ModeLine for 1366x768 in Flight 4.  I didn't even know what a ModeLine was previously...

By request, I am including the edited lines from my xorg.conf.

9) Touchpad is working after a fashion...  I have to drag my finger three times as far to move the mouse.  The touchpad is *way* too insensitive.  It takes a long time to move the pointer anywhere.  This issue was "fixed" by editing xorg.conf.

By request, I am including the edited lines from my xorg.conf.

10) Sleep worked, but took so long to come back up that I almost gave the system up for frozen.  Same for flight 4.

=== General Note ===
I have been testing using a vanilla install, plus the updates that the update manager pointed out when I first logged in.  There is an excellent guide in how to get more of the hardware for this laptop to work in this forum thread:

http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=87619

In Dapper Flight 4, the system has become much more stable.  I am in fact finally able to use it as my email and web browsing OS.  I have not yet completed all of the configuration necessary to make it my primary OS for everything, but I will probably do so after Dapper Release.

=== Live CD Issues ===
Tested with Dapper Live CD Flight 4.  The live CD for flight 4 did pretty much the same as the live CD for Flight 3.

==== Notes ====

I'm sorry I kept editing the wrong page.  I didn't notice that the wiki was redirecting me until I had done it twice.  I hope you will forgive this BDU.
