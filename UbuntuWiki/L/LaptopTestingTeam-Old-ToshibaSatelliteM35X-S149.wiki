__TOC__

* Contact: <nowiki>[[FrankMurphy2]]</nowiki>
* Make: Toshiba
* Brand: Satellite
* Model: M35X-S149

=== Sudden shutdown bug ===

Recent versions of Ubuntu may cause this laptop to power off without warning during the (graphical) bootup process. This is due to a buggy ACPI implementation in the BIOS, which can be fixed by upgrading the BIOS to the latest version offered by Toshiba ("ACPI Flash BIOS version 2.00" as of this writing). See <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/242400|this bug report]]</nowiki> for more information.

(Note that Toshiba's BIOS updater utility will appear to shut off the laptop before the update procedure is complete. Do not be afraid! In fact, the utility is "rebooting" the laptop after a successful update, after giving an ''extremely'' brief notice to the user.)

=== Current Issues ===
* Intermittent problems with battery ACPI info. Seems to be related to external monitor activation. Investigating.
* Some seemingly conflicting kernel modules are loaded. Investigating.
* Palm (and Visor) sync only seems to work with the USB 1.1 port (on the side) and not the USB 2.0 ports on the back. And it doesn't work after hibernate. JPilot fails with
<pre>
dlp_ReadSysInfo error
Exiting with status SYNC_ERROR_PI_CONNECT
Finished

==== Notes ====
* The M35X-S1491 is physically the same as the M35X-S149, the only difference is in the bundled version of Windows.
* S-video will work if fn+F5 are pressed during the Grub screen. Attatching and selecting a monitor after the laptop has booted into X will not work (a known limitation of XFree/Xorg, I belive). In no case can I have both the TV and LCD illumitated at the same time.
* Some keys require FreeZeeButton to activate. (This laptop has a Phoenix BIOS, instead of a Toshiba BIOS, so fnfx won't work.) The omnibook/omke kernel module might also activate these keys.
