Email: 
LGB is my nick name, if you can't figure out yet, even if you know some <nowiki>[[http://blog.lgb.hu/page24|other meaning]]</nowiki> of this "abbreviation". If you need further info, visit <nowiki>[[http://lgb.hu/|my page]]</nowiki> and sorry for my quite <nowiki>[[http://blog.lgb.hu/page22|poor English]]</nowiki>. Since you're browsing an Ubuntu oriented wiki, you may want to find some Ubuntu related information. What can I say? I've done some suggestions on Hungarian translation at <nowiki>[[http://launchpad.net/|Launchpad]]</nowiki>. Anyway I've done some work in the Linux/UNIX world as well in general, if it counts (like <nowiki>[[http://mplayerhq.hu/|MPlayer]]</nowiki> or <nowiki>[[http://blog.lgb.hu/page50|DOSRUN]]</nowiki> and several not-free projects done in my worktime).
