==== Notes ====
DAPPER:  Tried pci=noacpi and could not see root filesystem at boot.  replaced with irqpoll option and fixed sound and filesystem problem.  Function keys still not working.  Investigating why 3D didn't configure automagically.

BREEZY:  No function keys work.  Firewire fails to autoload sbp2 driver, driver fails to detect iPod.  Reboots on reading swap partition after hibernation.  Had to add pci=noacpi to get sound to work correctly.

BREEZY: To get DVD to work right, follow this proceedure:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| 1. sudo apt-get install libdvdread3 (you may get message already installed: ignore it)
|-
| 2. sudo /usr/share/doc/libdvdread3/examples/install-css.sh (run this anyway- to make sure)
|-
| 3. sudo apt-get install wget
|-
| 4. cd /tmp; wget ftp://ftp.nerim.net/debian-marillat/pool/main/w/w32codecs/w32codecs_20050412-0.0_i386.deb
|-
| 5. sudo dpkg -i w32codecs_20050412-0.0_i386.deb
|-
| 6. sudo apt-get install vlc
|-
| 7. vlc /media/cdrom
|-
| #7 will test it from terminal, after that you should be able to run from insert.
