=== Current Issues ===

| -The screen brightness can't be changed so far, none of the tools worked for this laptop (this is the biggest problem because it's almost impossible to stay watching such a bright screen, so I hope this problem will be solved soon. There are people working very hard to find a solution).

==== Notes ====
Sorry if the lay out is a little different from the other wiki's, but I'm having some problems with Firefox, feel free to edit the lay out, or to add working features.

I found this:

The folder /proc/acpi/video/GFX0 contains:

Folders:
DD01
DD02
DD03
DD04
DD05

Files:
DOS
info
POST
POST_info
ROM

Each of the folders contains:
Bestanden:

brightness
EDID
info
state

In the folder DD04, the file brightness contains:
------------------------------------------------------------------
levels: 100 100 4 16 28 40 52 64 76 88 100
current: 0
------------------------------------------------------------------
In the other folders: <not supported>

The file info contains each time:
------------------------------------------------------------------
device_id: 0x0000
type: unknown
known by bios: no
------------------------------------------------------------------

I can change the brightness file, when I then do "cat brightness", I see that the current value changed, but the actual brightness remains the same. I hope it'll be supported in the next driver release from Nvidia.

I sent a mail to Nvidia, the answer:
------------------------------------
Hello,

There have been recent reports of problems changing brightness.  Can you
generate and provide an nvidia-bug-report.log so we have another test
case to work with.

Thanks,
Roland

I think this means "Hope":-)
