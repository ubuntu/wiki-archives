=== Notes ===
* For ACPI Sleep to work, I had to uncomment a line in /etc/defaults/acpi-support.
* Hibernate goes to bed happily and wakes up most of the way, but stops at screen showing ACPI info -- the last screen  it would show before working. Update: as of April 11th, Hibernate works in dapper! I'm not trying a clean install of one of the flights, so this is rather unofficial, but I can confirm that with the latest round of updates, I have working hibernation on my system!

* * Pressing Fn+F2 results in Control-P, which does print in most applications, but not in emacs!

* ** Pressing Fn+F4 results in the screen going out of wack (colors look funny). Pressing again did not restore normalcy. I had to switch to a virtual terminal and back to recover. However, in Edgy it works well if an external screen is connected. If none is connected, you still get the out of wack screen.

* *** The LED does not change, but the wireless state does. You can make the LED change as well by using modprobe ipw2200 led=1. 

==== Notes on the dv1200ca ====
''Labelled as a dv1000 on the unit. Using DapperDrake(6.06).''

No ACPI modification needed. It "just works" from Ubuntu factory settings.
The modprobe trick doesn't make LED work for the dv1200ca. When coming out of a sleep state the wireless card was working fine earlier on in Dapper's development, but now I find it is acting somewhat buggy upon wakeup. Maybe because I am using NetworkManager rather than the default networking configuation software.
