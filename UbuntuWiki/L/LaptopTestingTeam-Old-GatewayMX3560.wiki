==== Notes ====
Video:

'''Fiesty'''

To get the 1280x768 screen resolution, launch the Synaptics Package Manager and install 'xserver-xorg-video-intel' package

'''Gutsy'''

I had to manuall modify the /etc/X11/xorg.conf and replace "i810" with "intel" for the video driver, even though the "xserver-xorg-video-intel" package was installed by default

Sound:

'''Fiesty and Gutsy'''

To activate the sound it follows the steps below:

* Using KMix from the KDE Panel
* Click on the Blue Speaker
* Click on the Mixer Button
* Click on the Switches Tab
* Click on 'External Amplifier" so that the yellow dot is not highlighted
* Close the open window.

It should keep the settings through reboot, mine did.

Touchpad:

'''Fiesty and Gutsy'''

I would recommend changing this section in /etc/X11/xorg.conf

I added the last two Option lines.  They let you run the synclient command to interact with the Touchpad, and correct the size of the scroll area on the right of the touchpad.

<pre>
Section "InputDevice"
        Identifier      "Synaptics Touchpad"
        Driver          "synaptics"
        Option          "SendCoreEvents"        "true"
        Option          "Device"                "/dev/psaux"
        Option          "Protocol"              "auto-dev"
        Option          "HorizScrollDelta"      "0"
        Option          "SHMConfig"             "1"
        Option          "RightEdge"             "5750"
