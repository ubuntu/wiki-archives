==== Notes ====

Tried with Feisty - however display didn't work, and as gutsy was only ~10 days away - didn't try any more and went to Gusty beta

Graphics driver - If using the free nvidia driver, brightness controls work perfectly in X, so does dimming when on battery, and machine goes into suspend and comes out of suspend if the suspend is short - if the suspend is long (overnight and plugged into mains) resume does not work.
Hibernate doens't work - goes into hibernate, but never resumes (either with free driver or Restricted)

With Restricted driver, brightness controls don't work, unless Ctrl+Alt+F1 into tty1, and then dim, and the Ctrl+Alt+F7 back to X.

There are Bug# for this, but don't have to hand at this precise moment - will update this when tested with Gutsy RC1 or Final
