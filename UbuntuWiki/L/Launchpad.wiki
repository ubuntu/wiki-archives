=== Answers ===
Launchpad Answers is a community based answer tracker. It is a great place to ask questions about Launchpad projects (ex. Ubuntu, Inkscape) . Some of the strengths of Launchpad Answers over other support resources are:

* tracking user questions in a similar way to bug reports
* notifying volunteer support contacts of new questions 
* building a searchable knowledge base of good answers 
* allowing people to ask questions and offer support in different languages.
It also serves as a simple ticketing system for tracking Launchpad admin requests.

=== Bugs ===

The two most common uses of Launchpads Bug feature by Ubuntu users is to report bugs and to triage bugs. Reporting Bugs you experience in Ubuntu and Ubuntu programs gives you a voice in getting problems with your software fixed. With Open Source Software you can fix, complain about, and help resolve issues with the software.
