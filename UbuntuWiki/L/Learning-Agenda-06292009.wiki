=== Minutes ===

'''Approval Process for Courses:'''

cprofitt > I think we need to work on an approval process for courses... review the content... quality, accuracy, etc.

'''Structure:'''

cprofitt > Last meeting a draft page - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Learning/Structure - was put up and people were asked to contribute their thoughts to what they wanted the structure to be... there have been no modifications to this page so I will ask again the people contribute their thoughts to this page.
