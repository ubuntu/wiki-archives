==== Notes ====
In Gnome environment you can use the brightness applet to adjust the brightness of the screen.

VT instructions are locked off by SONY, you have to "hack" the BIOS to turn on VT instructions.
For this you can use (at your own risk) the program VTPatch written by Igor Levicki that automatically patches any Sony Vaio BIOS to turn on VT instructions.
I took the risk and it worked seamlessly.
