== Who I am ==
I am a Software Engineer Prof II at Canonical, working as part of the Ubuntu Server team for the last 3 1/2 years. I have also been an Ubuntu core developer and a <nowiki>[[https://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=lena@voytek.dev|Debian Maintainer]]</nowiki> for around 2 years. I focus on maintaining our database ecosystem alongside various other server packages.

== Why I am standing in the elections ==
Last year at the Ubuntu Summit I hosted an <nowiki>[[https://events.canonical.com/event/51/contributions/576/|Ubuntu Core Dev office hours booth]]</nowiki>, and met many people from around the world interested in what we do. I was inspired to continue directing that passion into new contributions, and eventually new Ubuntu Developers.

Over the past year, I've also seen major strides at Canonical in providing a knowledge base for what is needed to obtain upload rights; and I want to make sure that the Ubuntu community as a whole can benefit from it. When I see a gap in available resources, I would like to help correct that, giving everyone a greater opportunity to contribute.

== How I will decide on applications ==
As a new face appearing in this election, I believe it is especially important that I describe what my decision process will look like.

At a base level, I want to make sure an applicant understands why they do what they do with Ubuntu specifically. This essentially means understanding Ubuntu's take on the package lifecycle and release model, along with the interactions that can happen between packages. 

For PPU applications, the applicant should understand what dependencies their package relies on, and what packages rely on it. They should also understand any quirks specific to the package that will likely show up when working with it.

Package sets require additional scrutiny based on what is needed to maintain them. This likely includes knowledge of transitions, MIRs, etc.

When it comes to Core Dev and MOTU, I would like to see a variety of existing package uploads, along with the future goal of uploading to packages beyond the purview of a single package set. Likewise, I believe they should have a strong understanding and at least some experience of what they will likely encounter throughout the archive.

In general, I will rely on the experience that the applicant provides ahead of time to show this, along with endorsements to confirm it. If there is a gap in what I expect to see, and an answer one way or another will affect my vote, then I plan to ask additional questions.

In the end, I will vote +1 if I believe the applicant understands what they may encounter and how to manage it with the power they have been provided. If something important is missing, I will vote -1 and give detailed information on what the issue is and how a +1 can be achieved next time. I only plan to provide a +0 when I believe there is an obvious conflict of interest.
