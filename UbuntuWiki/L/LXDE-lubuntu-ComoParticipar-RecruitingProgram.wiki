== Lubuntu is Recruiting ==

With the rapid growth of Lubuntu as one of the official variants of Ubuntu and <nowiki>[[http://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=popularity | Top15 on DistroWatch]]</nowiki> which proved itself as a strong player and tough competitor among 318 <nowiki>[[http://distrowatch.com/search.php?status=Active | Active Linux Distributions]]</nowiki>, it became necessary to keep pace with such growth and success. Hence, a Recruiting Program has started and <nowiki>[[amjjawad | amjjawad]]</nowiki> is our coordinator for this program.

=== Ubuntu Forum Program ===

This program was started on January, 2012 and it's aiming towards recruiting active and experienced members, those who have been around enough on Ubuntu Forum to be a great support for Lubuntu.

If you would like to join, please contact <nowiki>[[amjjawad | amjjawad]]</nowiki> on Ubuntu Forum. Please see <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/member.php?u=941822 | his profile link]]</nowiki>.
