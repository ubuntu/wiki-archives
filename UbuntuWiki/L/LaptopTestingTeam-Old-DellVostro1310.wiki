==== Notes ====
* The Fn+F1 (XF86StandBy) button only triggers Hibernate, not Sleep. The gnome-power-manager option is ignored.
To activate sleep use the power button and select the Sleep option.

To use hibernate with a swap file, follow the instructions here http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1042946

To access temperature information from the CPUs, install the sensors-applet package and run sensors-detect. More information on SensorInstallHowto

One can't use the 180 driver available from non-main repositories, since it won't allow to suspend. Even using the instructions at NvidiaLaptopBinaryDriverSuspend won't work. Use the 177 version.
