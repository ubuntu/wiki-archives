=== Current Issues ===
-= Dapper =-
* The PCI error was only a alert. It corresponds to the PCI Express port... Nothing to worry about.
* The card reader doesn't work. There is no driver available...
* Suspend to ram works but not suspend to disk.
-= Dapper BETA =-
* PCI error..  I filled a bug report. Bug #32342 
* Suspend to ram  WORKS!    (  yes! out of the box! nothing to do )
-= Dapper Drake Flight 3 =-
* Still got the weird PCI error. Card reader maybe? ( any help who be appreciated )
* Suspend to disk and to ram  does not work. 
-= Dapper Drake Flight 2 =-
* Got some weird error at boot. Something like PCI - Cannot Allocate block 7-8 & 9. I'll try to post the exact lines.
* **FIXED IN FLIGHT 3** Install went ok but i was not able to do a Wireless intallation ( with my Intel 2200BG ). Had to wired. ( For install only. )
* **FIXED IN FLIGHT 3** Touch Pad scrolling Side is broken. It was working in Breezy.
* Suspend to disk and suspend to RAM does not work
* **FIXED IN FLIGHT 3 ** Looks like HD is stopping after a few seconds of inactivity and when calling a new programs, HD wakes up thus taking more time to load and creating choppy/laggy moment.
-= Breezy =-
* Concerning sound : I'm using a realtek ALC880. I had to manually install drivers provided by realtek for Linux to make my Headphone Jack/Microphone work.
* * FIXED IN DAPPER **
