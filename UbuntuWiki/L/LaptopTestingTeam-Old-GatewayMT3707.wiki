=== Current Issues ===

Once every day or so, laptop (almost) locks completely. Mouse movement can be detected every 8 secs or so, but user is left with no real control. Switching to first tty with CTRL-ALT-F1 reveals the following output scrolling on the console:

hdb: drive not ready for command (about every sec)

BUG: soft lockup - CPU#0 stuck for 11s [swapper:0] (less common)

=== System Info ===
