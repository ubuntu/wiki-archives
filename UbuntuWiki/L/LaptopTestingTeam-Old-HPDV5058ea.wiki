=== Current Issues ===

Gutsy Gibbon beta:
Installation works perfectly but only with alternate CD.
Everything works fine including compiz with XGL and wireless.

Dapper Flight 6:
Installation seems to work at first if you add noapic. Afterwards I does not boot at all. 

On 5.10 
Screen frozes but could can solved adding "vga=771". There is a later issue that makes it uninstallable. The message is:
"error installing initrd-tools see /target/var/logbootstrap.log". Similar symptoms are described 
here:
https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/ubuntu-keyring/+bug/13881
and here:
http://www.ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-75430.html

But hardware clock seems to be on time. So, to sum up, not an easy laptop.

TODO: 
* Submit the bug. 
* Test more options: nolapic, etc...
