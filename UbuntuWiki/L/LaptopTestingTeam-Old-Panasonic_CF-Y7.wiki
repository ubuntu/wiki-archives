==== Notes ====

In Hardy (8.04 LTS) seems that everything work fine out of the box instead some minor bugs (see above).

In Intrepid (8.10), Jaunty (9.04) there was too much major bugs with integrated Intel video card and Compiz works very bad, so i'm not using that releases.

In Karmic (9.10) integrated video becomes more stable (not so fast as in Hardy), but there are a lot of other critical and major bugs, so i'm decided to not use Karmic and wait until Lucid (10.04 LTS) is out.
