=== Current Issues/News ===

* There are now VIA binary drivers available for 8.10/9.04 (26oct09) Version 86a-u904-50937. This driver is available under the Ubuntu 9.04 selection from VIA.

*** Note 1: Even though it is labeled 9.04 it does work for 8.10.

*** Note 2: RandR is working under 8.10 but fails under 9.04.

*** Note 3: This driver is recommended for both 8.10 and 9.04 as it brings improvements over previous drivers.

*** Some interesting things:

**** The latest via binary (5.74.33.86a-u904-50937.tgz) Works with 8.10 (Which is running a 2.6.27 kernel)

**** Reading this indicates inclusion of kernel frame buffer driver for 2.6.28
       ref: <nowiki>[[http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=via_nov_20&num=1]]</nowiki>

**** The same via binary (5.74.33.86a-u904-50937.tgz) Doesn't work with 8.10 (Which is running a 2.6.28 kernel)

**** Reports of VIA chips working (Unconfirmed) out of the box for Mandriva 2010 (Which is running a 2.6.31 kernel) 
       ref: <nowiki>[[http://www.viaarena.com/forums/showthread.php?t=35944&page=16]]</nowiki>
 
**** Current openchrome.org status: Pending....

* Install/Boot may fail (Screen corruption followed by lock up) with the latest BIOS versions. It may be necessary to re-flash the BIOS with an earlier version (download these from the HP website). (Recommend F.04).

=== Notes for all Versions of Ubuntu ===
Unless otherwise stated, all versions of Ubuntu require application of the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LaptopTestingTeam/HP2133/CPUScalingFix| HP2133 CPU Scaling Fix]]</nowiki>

If you install from USB pen drive you may have problems mounting USB pen drives after install. <<BR>> See this thread for more information on how to correct the problem: <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=574988|Fix USB mounting]]</nowiki>

=== Notes for 9.10 ===
* No VIA binaries available yet.
* External monitor only works if connected at boot time.
* Audio driver is flaky, sometimes fails to work at all, sometimes disappears after suspend or hibernate but comes back after reboot; when it starts it works fine though.
* On a fresh install of kubuntu/karmic my wireless wasn't working. It may be related to this <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/karmic/+source/jockey/+bug/443185 | bug]]</nowiki>. I was able to get wlan working by going to '''Administration> hardware drivers''' and enable the Broadcom STA which then downloaded drivers e.g.  I had to have a working wired connection to finish this. I had wireless working on reboot.
* Since Karmic uses GRUB2 rather than GRUB to pass boot options, I had to edit /etc/default/grub to implement the CPU scaling fix mentioned above and add "osi=\"!Windows 2006\". The back-slashes are necessary to escape the quotations within the stanza. The full line now looks like this: <code>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="acpi_osi=\"!Windows 2006\" quiet splash"</code>

=== Notes for 9.04 ===
* Smooth install with xubuntu 9.04 alternate cd. (au hp2133)
* Most hardware detected and working out of the box. (au hp2133)
* VIA binary video drivers (26oct09) released. RandR NOT working.
* When using Openchrome, vga out doesn't work.
* Webcam issues (ok in Cheese, Fails in other applications)

=== Notes for 8.10 ===
(Currently the only version with Latest VIA Binaries fully working)
* Successful install with xforcevesa option.
* VIA binary video drivers (26oct09) Released. RandR IS working.
* Reference material for 8.10 xorg.conf configuration: /DisplayConfig810
* Webcam issues (ok in Cheese, Fails in other applications)

=== Notes for 8.04 LTS ===
* Successful install with xforcevesa option.
* Wireless NIC '''(works fine with ndiswrapper, and with the new Broadcom STA driver)'''
** Native kernel driver b43.ko doesn't work (misses PIO support according to the logs)
** b43.ko prevents machine from suspending by crashing
** Quick fix to disable the problematic driver: echo 'blacklist b43' | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
* Correct audio driver not available (ADI SoundMax AD1984A)
** Headphone jack detection doesn't work '''(fixed with ALSA 1.0.17)'''
** Microphone jack and internal microphone not recognized '''(fixed with ALSA 1.0.17)'''
* Webcam issues (ok in Cheese, Fails in other applications)

 Without this I would never have been able to get my Mini-Note up and running.  Most of the tricks in the Installation How-To come from the talented folks in that thread.  Thank you.
