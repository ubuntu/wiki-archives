==== Notes ====

Preliminary Notes from running the 9.04 LiveCD on May 4, 2009:
* Bringing the session back up after being suspended kills the touchpad functionality.
* No login sound played when Ubuntu started. Initially running "speaker-test" resulted in no sound coming out the speakers, but didn't give any errors. I then ran sound tests in System/Preferences/Sound and it played sound. I then went back to "speaker-test" which resulted in sound. If you put the notebook into hybernation and then resume the session, it will play the login music.
* It appears not to play loud enough.
* When I plug in the USB mouse, it worse and the touch pad disables. When I unplug the mouse, the touch pad still doesn't work.

Install Notes from Jaunty Jackalope 9.04 on May 5, 2009
* Ubuntu played the log on music on boot after the default install. This is different than running Ubuntu via the LiveCD.
* It appears that the install doesn't reconize the video card properly: ATI Radeon HD 3200 Graphics RS780M.
* Ran the update manager to install the latest updates.
* After installing the available updates, Ubuntu was able to detest the video card.
* I installed the video card drivers from System/Administration Hardware Drivers, rebooted, and Changed the visual effects to "Extra" to be more aesthetically pleasing.
* Changed the "Power Management Preferences" to:
* * 30 minutes - Put computer to sleep when inactive for: - under AC Power tab.
* * 20 minutes - Put display to sleep when inactive for: - under AC Power tab.
* * checked the box for - Dim display when idle. - under AC Power tab.
* * 30 minutes - Put computer to sleep when inactive for: - under On Battery Power tab.
