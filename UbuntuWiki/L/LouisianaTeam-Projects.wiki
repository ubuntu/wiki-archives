=== Unorganized Ideas ===

{*} Ark-La-Tex Technology Expo <<BR>>
{*} Mini <nowiki>[[http://freedomtoaster.org/|Freedom Toaster]]</nowiki> <<BR>>
{*} LoCo forum/bug days including participation with larger community events <<BR>>
{*} Campaign to have major entertainment industry companies support Linux.  Think free episodes on network websites. <<BR>>
{*} shell script to use info from Launchpad to populate user info for shell.  Intent is giving Team members a standard setup for learning on IRC or sharing info. <<BR>>
{*} Small business setups <<BR>>
{*} Custom school distribution.  Have a live cd that is installable and will work with removable media.  Students will always be able to do their work as long as they have a free computer to use, the CD, and a flash drive.
