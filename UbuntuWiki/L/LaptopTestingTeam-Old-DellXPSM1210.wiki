=== Current Issues ===
 '''Notes for Hardy Heron'''
* Extending the desktop with one extra monitor does not work without editing the xorg.conf manually

 '''Notes for Hardy Heron alpha 4''' - Added (March 19/2008), JoelPauling
* Screen Res fails with 1280x800 with either nvidia or nv driver. Had to manually edit xorg.conf
* Suspend fails to restore with nvidia driver from restricted drivers
* Has the hard drive powermanagment overcycle issue still
* Closing lid causes hang of X
* Hibernate is still broken
* New Wireless driver works well (iwl3945, however is erroneously named wlan0_rename due to bug in udev naming scripts during install. Fixed by removing the udev rules and having them regenerated on reboot.
* New Alsa mixer labels are correct, but now has different behaviour with mic as output muting internal speakers (before both external speakers and internal would work)
* hsf modem drivers still not included or in restricted drivers, meaning modem still not working
* Plugging USB mouse in is detected, but is not useable automatically (maybe artefact of my Xorg copying from my working config under gusty)

 '''Notes for Kubuntu Gutsy Gibbon'''
* The default Power Management settings are not the best for a laptop (closing the lid doesn't trigger suspend/hibernate, the machine consumes all its battery, and an unclean shutdown ensues).
* If the laptop is connected to a TV with S-VHS, the session is locked when the lid closes. This can not be deactivated with the Power Manager, since it does not react to the setting. If I remember correctly, this only happens when there is a movie stream going to the TV. I will look more into this later.

| Yes. But when running at the native 1280x800 resolution cycling through built-in only, built-in + external and external only (Fn+F8)  does not adjust the resolution of the external display to one that the external monitor supports. This can be solved by configuring Xorg to have two Screen sections with different resolutions and using a different screen for the internal LCD display and for the external VGA port.

==== Notes ====

'''Dual core processor / SMP Kernel'''

When installing Ubuntu 6.06 (Dapper), a standard i386 kernel is installed, instead of a SMP one (this laptop has an Intel Core Duo processor). I had to install a SMP kernel and deinstall the one from the default install so that now linux sees the two cores:

<pre>
[fernan@dell] uname -a
Linux delia 2.6.15-26-686 #1 SMP PREEMPT Thu Aug 3 03:13:28 UTC 2006 i686 GNU/Linux
[fernan@dell] cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep -c proc
2
</pre>

'''NVidia / Intel graphics chipsets'''

This laptop has the option of either Intel GMA915 integrated graphics, or NVidia GO7400 graphics. The NVidia graphics work just as any other NVidia card does under Ubuntu. Default X configuration uses the nv driver. Installing the proprietary driver from multiverse-restricted enables hardware accelleration. The problems with the native 1280x800 screen resolution only apply to the Intel chipset. The NVidia chipset does not suffer from these problems.

'''xorg.conf (Intel)'''

The default installation worked out of the box, but the resolution was not set to the native (wide) resolution of the built-in LCD screen (1280x800) but to a square resolution instead (don't remember if it was 1024x768 or 1280x1024). I have manually edited the xorg.conf file and changed the 'Modes' lines to add more 'wide' resolutions:

<pre>
    Modes "1280x800" "1280x768" "1200x800" "1152x864" "1152x768" "1024x768" "800x600" "640x480"
</pre>

Cycling through 'LCD only', 'LCD + CRT' and 'CRT only' works (Fn + F8), but given that I have set my screen to use a wide resolution (1280x800), and the CRT and/or projectors I've tried all expect more 'square' resolutions like 800x600, the switch results in either no image on the external monitor ('frequency out of range') or a bad image (disturbing refresh rate, badly placed image). I have not tried this with the dapper default resolution though ... I'm inclined to say that it should have worked ... but the truth is that in Windows XP, the default resolution is the native one (1280x800) and upon cycling using Fn+F8, the resolution is automatically changed to one that the external monitor accepts.

'''Built-in webcam'''

The laptop has a built-in webcam (mic and video). The device is detected (appears in lsusb), and upon running the Ekiga Configuration Assistant it records my voice and plays it back OK. The video works once uvc driver installed.

'''Wireless NIC'''

The built-in Intel Pro Wireless 3945ABG is not detected nor configured at install time because the required kernel module, daemon and other tools are not part of the default Dapper installation. To make the wireless NIC work, I had to install the linux-restricted modules.
 
Works out of the box with Edgy.

'''Built-in Card reader'''

The M1210 has a built-in card reader that accepts MMC, SD, Memory stick and a few other card formats. The built-in reader works in Windows XP (tested with a SD card and a Sony memory stick), but in Ubuntu cards inserted into the reader are not detected.

With Feisty, the card reader works (tested with SD card, automatically mounted).

A SD card is detected, and automatically mounted though, if it's inserted into an external card reader plugged into a USB port. 

Also, if you build a new kernel (I tested this with a newer 2.6.17 kernel from kernel.org), and you build support for the reader into the kernel (as opposed to as a dynamically loaded kernel module), cards are detected and automatically mounted. In your kernel.config make sure you have:

<pre>
CONFIG_MMC=y
CONFIG_MMC_BLOCK=y
CONFIG_MMC_SDHCI=y
CONFIG_MMC_WBSD=y
</pre>

'''Palm Tungsten E (USB)'''

I have this PDA, and tried to configure gpilot to sync with it. But, when connecting the PDA and starting a 'sync' ubuntu does nothing ... /dev/pilot does not exist
