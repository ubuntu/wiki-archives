__TOC__

* Contact: JaapJanVanDerVeen , Exactt
* Brand: Compal
* Make : HEL
* Model: 80
* Website: <nowiki>[[http://www.compal.com/index_En.htm|Compal homepage]]</nowiki>
** Specifications: <nowiki>[[http://www.compal.com/Product/Html/notebook/EL80.htm]]</nowiki>

The HEL80 is similar to the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LaptopTestingTeam/CompalHEL81|HEL81]]</nowiki>. The main differences are the Nvidia Geforce Go 7600, the presence of a web cam and a finger printer and four extra media buttons.

Compal sells the HEL80 with two different screens a glossy WXGA+ (1280x800) and a matte WSXGA+ (1680x1050) screen. The laptop used for testing has the latter screen.

=== Current Issues ===
** Finger printer not working. This device is also found in the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LaptopTestingTeam/Lenovo3000N100_0768|Lenovo 3000N]]</nowiki>.
** The modem also isn't working. Same type as <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LaptopTestingTeam/CompalHEL81|Compal HEL81]]</nowiki>.
** Built- in dual (analog/ DVB-T) TV- tuner isn't working (10fd:0535). There is a website dedicated to getting the Trident TM6000 chip to work in video4linux: http://www.linuxtv.org/v4lwiki/index.php/Trident_TM6000.
** The bootloader needs the "noapic" option in order to preserve energy. See ReschedulingInterrupts for more information.

==== Notes ====
1. These keys are located at the top, next to the leds for Caps Lock, Num Lock and Scroll Lock
2. These keys are located on the left. They have a double meaning, but that is because rumour has it that Compal wanted to create a stand- alone media player, outside of an OS. But that idea was never realized. Hence, the Mode on/ off key has no special function.
3. Made the external monitor work with this added to /etc/X11/xorg.conf:
<pre>
Section "Device"
...
        Option          "TwinView"              "True"
        Option          "TwinViewXineramaInfoOrder" "DFP, CRT"
        Option          "ConnectedMonitor"      "DFP-0,CRT-0"
        Option          "TwinViewOrientation"   "DFP LeftOf CRT"
        Option          "MetaModes"             "DFP-0: 1680x1050, CRT-0: 1400x1050_60; DFP-0: 1680x1050, CRT-0: NULL;"
...
EndSection
</pre>
Add everything between both '...' (do not include the three dots) and edit the resolutions to what you need. Then restart X and you will be able to change the resolution under 'System' --> 'Preferences' --> 'Screen Resolution'.
4. An open-source driver is available from <nowiki>[[https://groups.google.com/group/microdia|here]]</nowiki>. A binary driver for the built-in webcam(ID 0c45:624f) can be obtained <nowiki>[[http://www.linux-projects.org/modules/news/|here]]</nowiki>. For further information see the Webcam section of <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LaptopTestingTeam/Lenovo3000N100_0768|Lenovo 3000N]]</nowiki>
5. If followed <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NvidiaLaptopBinaryDriverSuspend|this]]</nowiki> to get suspend2ram working. But unlike stated there I set Option "NvAGP" "0" (not "1"). I followed step 2 as described. Furthermore I added two lines to /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist:
<pre>
blacklist intel_agp
blacklist agpgart
</pre>
  Finally here comes the weird part. Run glxgears for a couple of seconds and suspend is working. Alternatively you can activate Desktop Effects to get it working.
