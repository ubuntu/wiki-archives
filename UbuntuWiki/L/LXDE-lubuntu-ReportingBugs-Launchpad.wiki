=== Introduction to Launchpad ===

Julien has been kind enough to put some links together for navigating through Launchpad. As he gets time, they will get tidied up, so this is a work-in-progress.

Launchpad is not easy to use the first time :) This is a couple of
useful links I use very often :

To tracking bugs which interest you, you can use
https://bugs.launchpad.net/people/+me 

If you want to search in bugs you reported :
https://bugs.launchpad.net/people/+me/+reportedbugs 

If you want to search in bugs you subscribed :
https://bugs.launchpad.net/people/+me/+subscribedbugs 

You can also use the +source to search on a specific package :
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/the_name_of_the_package 

Example, to view bugs about pcmanfm :
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pcmanfm 

To view general information about a package :
https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/the_name_of_the_package 

Example, for pcmanfm :
https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pcmanfm 

Finally, if you want a dashboard of bugs for Lubuntu :
https://bugs.launchpad.net/~lubuntu-packaging/+packagebugs 
 
The people at the bug-squad are always updating their area, with help and tips on the filing of bugs <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BugSquad|Bug Squad]]</nowiki>.
