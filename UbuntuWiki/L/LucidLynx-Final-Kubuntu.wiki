The improved System Tray now can include various widgets, such as the improved Device Notifier, Battery monitor, and  our Indicator Display.

Nepomuk Semantic Search has matured greatly.

=== Official Kubuntu Netbook Remix release ===
<nowiki>[[attachment:LucidLynx-RC-Kubuntu-netbook.png|<nowiki>[[File:LucidLynx-RC-Kubuntu-wee-netbook.png]]</nowiki></nowiki>]]

Sit back and relax while installing Kubuntu and watch the lovely slideshow showcasing KDE applications included in the default installation. Or just use them, since it's a Live CD. ;-)

=== Touchpad Configuration ===
<nowiki>[[File:LucidLynx/RC/Kubuntu/wee-touchpad.png]]</nowiki>

The new touchpad configuration section of System Settings allows you to fine-tune how your laptop's touchpad behaves.

=== System Notification Polish ===
The notifications for available codecs, required restarts and upgrade information have been further integrated into the KDE notification system, giving these notifications a seamless way to integrate with the rest of the notifications the Plasma desktop provides. They have also been optimized, taking up much less RAM than before.

=== KDE integration for Firefox ===
<nowiki>[[File:LucidLynx/RC/Kubuntu/wee-firefox.png]]</nowiki>

Firefox now integrates better with KDE, providing native KDE file dialogs as well as respecting your default choices for opening files, as set in KDE. Our Firefox installer provides the packages needed, if you have installed Firefox manually or via a package manager, please install the package ''kmozillahelper''.

=== GNOME app systray integration ===
Work has gone in to integrating GNOME tray icons into the Plasma desktop, so that GNOME apps supporting the integration will share a consistent appearance with the rest of your KDE apps.
