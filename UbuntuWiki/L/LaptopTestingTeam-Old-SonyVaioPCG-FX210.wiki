__TOC__

* Contact: <nowiki>[[Audiophyl]]</nowiki>
* Brand: Sony
* Make : Vaio
* Model: PCG-FX210
* Website: http://esupport.sony.com/US/perl/model-home.pl?mdl=PCGFX210

=== Current Issues (Feisty) ===
* "Volume Up" hotkey  (Fn + F4) works, "Volume Down" hotkey (Shift + Fn + F4) doesn't
* Hotkey to switch to TV-out doesn't work (TV-out can be had via package "atitvout")
* This laptop has an ATI Rage Mobility M1, which requires the Mach64 portion of the X.org ATI driver.  It is possible to enable DRI via recompilation of several modules (DRM, DRI, and xf86-video-ati), but DRI is not supported out of the box due to the missing mach64.ko DRM module.  There seems to be quite an interest in functional DRI for Mach64, as evidenced by <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=7200|ubuntuforums.org - HOWTO: enable 3d acceleration w/ Rage Mobility (mach64)]]</nowiki> (134 posts , more than 59,000 views).
* "Hibernate" will first enable the screensaver, then log out, then complete hibernation.  Applications are improperly shut down.  The system will emerge from hibernation to the login screen.

=== Current Issues (Gutsy) ===
* In order to install you may need to set "PnP OS" to "No" in the BIOS, as well as specify "acpi=off" as a boot parameter.
* While enabling DRI is possible, it's not simple.  See the note for Feisty.
* None of the keyboard audio controls work.  Fn+F4 = Volume Up, Fn+Shift+F4 = Volume Down, Fn+F3 = Mute.
