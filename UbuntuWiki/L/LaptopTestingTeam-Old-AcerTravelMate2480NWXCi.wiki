=== Current Issues ===

* 2)  Network Manager don't associate with a AP without DHCP ( we use PPPoE, no DHCP address handed out).
No visible way to connect using PPPoE - ideally it should be in Network-Manager and/or Network Settings.
Once configured PPPoE should try to connect through any available interface (as in Windows).

==== Notes ====
Similar with TravelMate 2490 series, only with a 14" display instead of 15".

* 1) Read "[WWW] https://help.ubuntu.com/community/i915Driver". At "Software Sources" add "universe". Do "sudo apg-get install 915resolution".

* 3) Onboard speakers are muted by default. In volume control applet enable and unmute "Surround" to use speakers. Headphones work by default, are controlled by "Front" control. Speakers are not muted when headphones are in use.

* 4) Read "[WWW]  http://blog.yamisonic.info/wifi-bcm4318-sdcard.html". Add "tifm_sd" to "/etc/modules"

* 5) Read "[WWW] http://madwifi.org/wiki/UserDocs/Distro/Ubuntu". 
Install linux-restricted-modules repository.
Install wifitools from "[WWW] http://packages.debian.org/cgi-bin/search_packages.pl?keywords=madwifi-tools&searchon=names&subword=1&version=testing&release=all"
Wireless LED is allways on, regardess wireless module status.

If wireless module is off ( by hardware button ) the wifi module will complain ( do a dmesg | grep wifi ):

 wifi%d: unable to attach hardware: 'Hardware revision not supported' (HAL  status 13)

In this case, push hardware WiFi button and reload driver (  modprobe -r ath_pci ; modprobe ath_pci).

Only if the driver is succesfully installed the LED can be controlled as per "[WWW] http://madwifi.org/wiki/UserDocs/EnableLEDs".
