Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[17:23:58] sure, go ahead

Jun 17 *	bgs100 [17:24:01] initiates learning power thormal drive

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[17:24:07] ok

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[17:24:23] Welcome to C# course by juju2143.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[17:24:39] Yay

Jun 17 *	seidos [17:24:44] claps

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[17:25:01] Today, history of C# and your first program.

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[17:25:47] 1st lesson: What is C#

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[17:26:41] C# is a OOP language invented by Microsoft, with a free implementation by Novell

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[17:27:16] Mono?

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[17:27:25] yep, Mono

Jun 17 <seidos>	[17:27:31] what is mono?

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[17:27:47] I won't take my time telling everything, just check wikipedia.

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[17:28:10] Mono is the free implementation of the .NET Framework

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[17:28:35] so it makes the language multi-plateform and multi-OS

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[17:28:48] much like Java.

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[17:30:00] So C# is perfect to make your app working on everything.

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[17:30:15] Anyone is on Windows here?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[17:30:30] I'm not

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[17:30:40] Good

Jun 17 <seidos>	[17:31:20] does mono work on all platforms equally well?

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[17:31:33] seidos, yes

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[17:31:48] doesn't C work on all platforms?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[17:32:06] pedro3005, Yes, but you have to recompile and there are compiler differences.

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[17:32:15] pedro3005, yes but you have to compile it to every platform

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[17:32:18] yeah

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[17:32:28] ok, I see

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[17:32:28] go on

Jun 17 <seidos>	[17:32:30] I thought C# was different than C

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[17:32:50] It is, pedro3005 was just asking about C also.

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[17:32:52] it is

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[17:33:00] so with Mono you have the same .exe working everywhere, with a language like C or Java

Jun 17 <seidos>	[17:33:06] ah, I see now

Jun 17 <seidos>	[17:34:03] I'm confused again, you compile a .exe one time, and that binary will work on both windows and GNU/Linux?

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[17:34:25] seidos, yes.

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[17:34:40] sounds good

Jun 17 <seidos>	[17:34:45] wow

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[17:35:19] Unlike Java, the app is seamlessly integrated with windows

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[17:35:31] it's what makes its force.

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[17:35:46] Personally, it's my favorite language

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[17:36:06] Once I made a .jar (Java Archive) that worked fine here but then said it couldn't find the main class on windows :/

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[17:36:17] Anyway

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[17:36:25] yeah...

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[17:36:58] Things like that could happen, but it's like you are missing a .dll.

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[17:37:42] So for developping, any text editor with syntaxing coloration will work.

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[17:38:33] But I would recommand you MonoDevelop (for Linux and Windows) or Microsoft Visual Studio (for Windows).

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[17:40:03] And, of course, you need mono. They are easily findable in your package manager.

Jun 17 *	bgs100 [17:40:07] installs MonoDevelop (package monodevelop in Ubuntu)

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[17:40:27] I'll go do something while you are downloading them.

Jun 17 <seidos>	[17:41:33] is monodevelop the only package I have to install?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[17:42:37] monodevelop seems to depend on mono.

Jun 17 <seidos>	[17:43:26] k cool, so it'll get installed automatically

Jun 17 <seidos>	[17:43:29] I have another question

Jun 17 <seidos>	[17:43:39] it seems a lot of software development is going to start moving to web apps

Jun 17 <seidos>	[17:43:46] can you develop web applications with C#?

Jun 17 *	bgs100 [17:44:07] pings juju2143 on seidos's behalf

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[17:44:12] seidos, yes

Jun 17 <seidos>	[17:44:38] it seems like most mainstream languages can work for web apps

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[17:45:01] IIS servers lets you use C# as part of their aspx thing

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[17:45:26] There is also a plugin in apache to use mono

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[17:46:50] Cool

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[17:47:04] But I never figured out how to use it...

Jun 17 <seidos>	[17:47:17] I don't have a webserver anyway

Jun 17 <seidos>	[17:47:26] unless i ran it on my laptop

Jun 17 <seidos>	[17:47:37] worse, I don't have an idea or the skill to develop a web app :P

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[17:48:42] yeah, you are better to develop your web app with PHP.

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[17:48:58] So you have downloaded MonoDevelop.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[17:49:34] Yep

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[17:49:39] right? tell me if so.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[17:49:43] It's running right now

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[17:49:47] ok

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[17:49:49] seidos, pedro3005 ?

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[17:49:57] hey

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[17:50:34] It's installing, you can stat

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[17:50:37] start

Jun 17 <seidos>	[17:50:48] i'm installed

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[17:50:48] ok

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[17:51:05] Now start a new solution

Jun 17 <seidos>	[17:51:14] and running

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[17:51:17] ok

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[17:51:28] What kind?

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[17:51:33] Start a new console project in C#

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[17:51:54] give your solution a name

Jun 17 <seidos>	[17:52:00] under C# I have ASP.NET, General, Gtk, Misc

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[17:52:14] Click on C#

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[17:52:21] directly

Jun 17 <seidos>	[17:52:22] nevermind

Jun 17 <seidos>	[17:52:27] I did new file, not new solution

Jun 17 <seidos>	[17:52:28] sorry

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[17:52:32] oh

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[17:53:07] So first lesson, your projects are arranged as solutions

Jun 17 <seidos>	[17:53:23] juju2143,  should I check any of the "project features" packaging, GTK# support, etc?

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[17:53:43] A solution can be composed of more than one project

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[17:53:53] hm, no features as of now.

Jun 17 <seidos>	[17:53:53] nm, that was a stupid question, it's obviously no

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[17:54:41] Eh, it might not have been.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[17:54:44] anyway

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[17:54:56] So in front of your eyes, you have a sample file.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[17:55:06] Yep

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[17:55:19] You will recognize the famous Hello World! text

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[17:55:26] Also yep

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[17:55:33] console project, empty project, gtk, what?

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[17:55:33] Compile it and execute it

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[17:55:39] pedro3005, Console

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[17:55:44] pedro3005, console project

Jun 17 *	bgs100 [17:56:13] looks around for run button

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[17:56:24] Oh

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[17:56:25] F5

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[17:56:27] There it is

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[17:56:28] It runs

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[17:56:30] Ctrl-F5

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[17:56:38] Yay

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[17:56:41] So you will see... Hello World.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[17:56:54] *nods*

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[17:57:06] Wonderful, isn't it?

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[17:57:20] Let's analyse the Main.cs file togheter.

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[17:57:53] Obviously, Main.cs contains the first function to be executed, Main().

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[17:58:14] Line 1, you have "using System;"

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[17:59:17] Tells the compiler to link the System library, which contains all the essential functions used in your project.

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[17:59:42] namely Console.writeline?

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[17:59:46] Yep

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[17:59:57] Console.WriteLine is part of System

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[18:00:04] alright

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:00:30] line 3, you have a namespace

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:01:00] in yoour namespace you have a class

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:01:13] and in your class you have a function.

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:01:36] This hierarchi is actually OOP.

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:02:01] Now let's analyse Console.WriteLine.

Jun 17 <seidos>	[18:02:13] so a namespace, class, and function are "objects"?

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:02:23] yes.

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:02:33] So, WriteLine is a function in the Console class

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:02:45] which is in the System namespace

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[18:03:23] what is a namespace?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[18:03:27] So does "using" bring in the things in a namespace?

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:03:32] so the using System; line is used to tell the compiler we will use the System namespace by defauld

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:03:37] default

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:03:56] so we won't write System.Console.WriteLine

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:04:20] It's handy.

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:04:34] Of course, you can have more than one namespace

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[18:04:43] I don't understand line 7

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:05:02] Line 7... It's the next thing I'll talk of.

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:05:42] so you see Main, which is the name of the function

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:06:02] since we are in a class, the function is actually a method.

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:06:48] your functions, as usual, will have parameters, Main(string[] args)

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[18:07:08] why "string[] args"?

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:07:09] So you will see that the variables are strongly typed.

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:07:23] args is an array of strings.

Jun 17 <seidos>	[18:07:51] I don't understand why it has parameters

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[18:07:53] and first, why is Main receiving arguments? what is it receiving from?

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:07:58] so you have the type, string, [] who tells your variable is an array

Jun 17 <seidos>	[18:08:06] all it's doing is writing out "hello world" why would it need any parameters?

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:08:14] and args is the arguments to your programs

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:08:35] Like in C you would do main(argc, argv)

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[18:08:37] pedro3005, It's like C's main; it can be passed the array of command line arguments.

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[18:09:14] I normally just do main()

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:09:14] But in this case we have only one variable, argc is actually args.Length

Jun 17 <seidos>	[18:09:30] when I take out the parameters from main it still compiles okay it seems

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:09:39] Main() is perfectly acceptable

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[18:09:57] pedro3005, Yes, but you can take the command-line arguments if you need them\

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:09:59] Take out the args and it compiles

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:10:09] brb, moms calling me.

Jun 17 <seidos>	[18:10:19] but that makes me wonder why it compiles with parameters that appear not to be used

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[18:12:42] seidos, I imagine it might generate a warning, but not an error.

Jun 17 <seidos>	[18:12:57] yeah, that's what I was thinking

Jun 17 <seidos>	[18:13:05] maybe there was a warning but didn't see it

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:13:11] back

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:13:24] There is no warning.

Jun 17 <seidos>	[18:13:37] 0 errors and 0 warnings

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:13:45] Yep.

Jun 17 <seidos>	[18:13:49] I guess it doesn't really matter, I can't think of why it would be a warning

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[18:13:59] Is there something like C's -Wall?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[18:14:02] er

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[18:14:03] I see, I just don't exactly understand why string[] args

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[18:14:04] gcc's*

Jun 17 <seidos>	[18:14:09] can I put anything I want into Main()

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:14:17] Yeah, unused variables don't change anything in your program.

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:14:57] bgs100, yes, I think, the compiler is actually part of GCC

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:15:04] or sth

Jun 17 <seidos>	[18:15:15] if I add blah to main() so it reads Main(string[] args blah) I get an error

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[18:15:24] well obviously

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[18:15:31] pedro3005, I imagine that it's like C; [] denotes an array of an object, string is the object, and args is the variable name

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[18:15:53] The command-line arguments being a list of strings.

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[18:15:55] so it's like int args but only string[] args?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[18:16:16] As far as I understand (/me is kind of playing teacher here :P)

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:16:23] yeah

Jun 17 <seidos>	[18:16:29] pedro3005, well why?  string[] and args aren't doing anything either

Jun 17 <seidos>	[18:16:40] why does the compiler hate my blah?

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[18:16:57] seidos, because string[] and args are not two variables

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[18:16:58] just one

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:17:01] of course, but if in comand line you do ./test.exe some arg well see it

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[18:17:01] args

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:17:17] yeah, it's strongly typed

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[18:17:22] Console.WriteLine(args);

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[18:17:25] I get

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[18:17:30] System.String[]

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:17:32] You have to use Main(strings[] args, int blah)

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:17:56] pedro3005, you have to do a for loop

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[18:18:10] If you wanted to print each arg?

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:18:13] We will try this.

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:18:34] for(int i=0; i<args.Length; i++)

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:18:45] Console.WriteLine(args[i]);

Jun 17 <seidos>	[18:18:48] so string[] args is one parameter, so how do I add another one, string[] blah or int blah?

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:19:01] Main(strings[] args, int blah)

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:19:29] but it's useless, all the parameters are stored in a list in args

Jun 17 <seidos>	[18:19:57] putting this:  Main(string[] args, int blah) gave me an error

Jun 17 <seidos>	[18:20:35] args is a system var?

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[18:20:53] it outputs... nothing

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:21:09] Yes, Main have to have 0 or 1 argument to be executed

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:21:26] Main with 2 arguments is a completly different function

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[18:21:31] how do I feed some argument to it?

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:21:41] pedro3005, go in command line

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[18:22:00] juju2143, What about Run -> Run With -> Custom Parameters?

Jun 17 <seidos>	[18:22:01] where is the binary located?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[18:22:10] Would that work?

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:22:11] bgs100, yes!

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:22:14] I twould

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[18:22:15] :D

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:22:44] seidos, it's usually located in ~/Projects/name of solution/name of project/bin/Debug

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[18:22:49] Yay it worked

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:22:49] cd there

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[18:22:53] bgs100, mine doesn't have that!

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[18:22:57] :(

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[18:22:57] pedro3005, 0_o

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[18:23:08] pedro3005, Run on the top menubar?

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[18:23:15] yeah

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[18:23:21] Do you have that?

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:23:23] yeah

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[18:23:24] which version is yours?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[18:23:35] 2.2.1

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[18:23:40] mine is 2.0

Jun 17 <seidos>	[18:23:46] mine is 2.0 too

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[18:23:46] ...

Jun 17 <seidos>	[18:23:53] don't have run with

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[18:23:55] freaking ubuntu apt-get

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:23:59] pedro3005, what version of Ubuntu you have?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[18:24:00] pedro3005,

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[18:24:04] I used apt-get too

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[18:24:05] juju2143, 9.10

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[18:24:09] Ah

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:24:11] Obviously not Lucid

Jun 17 *	bgs100 [18:24:12] has 10.04 :D

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:24:14] yeah

Jun 17 <seidos>	[18:24:16] I did apt-get monodevelop

Jun 17 *	juju2143 [18:24:17] too

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[18:24:17] juju2143, That is lucid

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[18:24:19] too lazy to Lucid

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[18:24:29] ERrrrrrrr

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[18:24:32] Sorry

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[18:24:33] My bad

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:24:34] 9.10 is Karmic

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[18:24:39] K is before 'L' xP

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:24:43] Lol.

Jun 17 <seidos>	[18:24:43] don't even ask what version of Ubuntu I'm running

Jun 17 *	bgs100 [18:24:58] is now tempted to ask

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[18:24:59] 8.04?

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:25:00] bgs100, learn your alphabet and come back when you did

Jun 17 <seidos>	[18:25:05] Lucid Beta messed up my system, so I'm running on a hybrid MoonOS with ubuntu-desktop installed

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[18:25:05] :(

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[18:25:10] I know my alphabet!

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:25:15] j/k lol.

Jun 17 <seidos>	[18:25:18] :'(

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:25:28] just messing with ya.

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[18:25:29] juju2143, well, you need to explain 'static' and 'void'

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:25:33] seidos, Lolwut.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[18:25:37] acdbefgihjlknmoprqtsuvxwyz

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[18:25:42] See!?

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:25:55] Yep. public static void.

Jun 17 <seidos>	[18:25:57] bgs100, now do it backwards!

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:26:15] my alphabet is qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[18:26:25] zywxvustqrpomnkljhigfebdca

Jun 17 *	seidos [18:26:41] stares at bgs100 in amazement

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:27:12] So, void indicates the type of the return

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[18:27:13] print string.ascii_lowercase

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[18:27:41] pedro3005, !!!

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[18:27:51] This is a C# class, not Python!

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:27:56] Yeah.

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:28:03] Calm down guys.

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[18:28:03] :P that's my alphabet

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:28:10] I'll continue

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[18:28:14] go on

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:28:21] So, void indicates the type of the return

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[18:28:31] which is nothing?

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:28:35] Yes.

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:28:47] Try to change void by int

Jun 17 <seidos>	[18:28:49] return is different than output?

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[18:28:54] shouldn't it return 0?

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:28:55] yes

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:29:01] and return 0;

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:29:09] add return 0; at the end

Jun 17 <seidos>	[18:29:27] is monodevelop an IDE?

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:29:35] pedro3005, if you write void, by dfault it's 0

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:29:42] seidos, of course it is

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[18:29:42] Oh I see

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:30:16] So your application should exit by returning 0

Jun 17 <seidos>	[18:30:24] cool, now I can say "I've used a C# IDE"

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:30:31] hehe

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[18:30:58] ok, let's go on... static means?

Jun 17 <seidos>	[18:31:01] it's much nicer than python, like how you type int and it gives you a list of possibilites

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[18:31:15] seidos, Language != IDE

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[18:31:16] seidos, just download a Python IDE

Jun 17 <seidos>	[18:31:38] there's a python IDE?

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[18:31:44] probably

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[18:31:45] There's many

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[18:32:01] There's even something of a standard one; Python's IDLE

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[18:32:03] but this is a C# class

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[18:32:04] Anyway

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[18:32:07] Yeah

Jun 17 <seidos>	[18:32:08] hmmm that would probably help my inability to recall commands a bit

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:32:12] static is that you don't have to put your class in a new object to invoke Main

Jun 17 <seidos>	[18:32:12] sorry

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:32:35] We will se that with the new operator

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[18:32:45] oh, I think I know what you mean

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:32:50] Like WriteLine is static

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[18:32:55] so you do not need to instanciate Main to invoke it?

Jun 17 <seidos>	[18:32:58] I'll have to think on it to hopefully understand

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:33:05] you dont have to do Console something = new console

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:33:16] pedro3005, yep

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[18:33:24] Yeah, I see it

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[18:33:25] okay

Jun 17 <seidos>	[18:34:40] but isn't the class in a "new object" the object namespace "FirstSolution"?

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:34:47] and public, Main is visible in your instance, unlike private, who will make your function only accessible inside your class

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:35:21] Namespaces is only related with the using instruction.

Jun 17 <seidos>	[18:35:49] so it can't be said the class is inside the object namespace?

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:36:06] it does

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:36:23] Classes is in namespaces.

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:36:26] etc.

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:36:39] Any other questions?

Jun 17 <seidos>	[18:36:49] but you said static is so that you don't have to put your class in another object before you call main

Jun 17 <seidos>	[18:36:55] but isn't the class already in an object?

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:37:11] yeah, everything is object

Jun 17 <seidos>	[18:37:35] I'm obviously missing something, because static is required for compilation

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:38:18] yeah, that's because the compiler don't instanciate the class before using it

Jun 17 <seidos>	[18:38:29] can you give an example of a program where static isn't needed while still calling main?

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:38:41] Of course.

Jun 17 <seidos>	[18:39:18] I don't get the compiler stuff, but maybe if I think some more it will make more sense

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:39:20] Just create a new function like Main

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:39:26] and call it in Main

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[18:39:41] seidos, Everything is an object, including classes but whereas you have to make an new object *from* a class to use non-static methods, static methods do not rely on non-static data from a class and can be called without making an instance of a class.

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:39:55] brb, i'll take my notes for the next part of the course.

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:40:51] K, found them.

Jun 17 <seidos>	[18:41:26] bgs100, I read what you wrote three times, still don't really get it

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:41:43] yeah, OOP is hard to get sometimes.

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:42:09] Just ignore static for now and we'll talk of that in the right chapter.

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:43:08] Create another solution, a GTK+ one now.

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:43:24] GTK#

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:43:25] *

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[18:44:38] done

Jun 17 <seidos>	[18:44:45] done

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:45:02] brb

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[18:45:22] I got an error

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[18:45:51] ....it seemed to work anyway

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[18:46:05] (/home/pedro/Projects/Gtk First/Gtk First/bin/Debug/Gtk First.exe:4593): GLib-WARNING **: g_set_prgname() called multiple times

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:47:53] hmmm

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:48:24] Yeah, seems that nothing is working right.

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:49:04] You have somes minutes pause while i find a workaround

Jun 17 <seidos>	[18:50:03] it worked okay for me it looks like

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[18:50:06] alright, quick run to the store

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[18:50:07] brb

Jun 17 <seidos>	[18:50:11] no errors and I was able to compile

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:51:16] ok

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:51:29] seems you have to install gtk-sharp2

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:51:39] apt-get install gtk-sharp2

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:52:55] The course will resume when pedro3005 willl be back.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[18:53:59] 0_0

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[18:54:07] back

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[18:54:15] I got warnings/errors too

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:54:44] bgs100, apt-get install gtk-sharp2 then restart MonoDevelop

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[18:55:37] okay

Jun 17 *	seidos [18:56:08] checks to see if he already has gtk-sharp2

Jun 17 <seidos>	[18:56:27] nope

Jun 17 <seidos>	[18:56:34] maybe I should install it anyway

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[18:57:05] yeah

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[18:58:22] Er

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[18:58:32] How do I re-open the solution

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[18:58:33] ?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[18:58:55] oh

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[18:58:56] nvm

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[18:59:10] Yay it worked

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[19:01:39] yay.

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[19:02:06] omg 23 UTC.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:02:09] I'm supposed to start a C class in a few minutes, btw.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:02:11] Yeah

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[19:02:20] End of lesson 1.

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[19:02:27] on hello worlds.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:03:24] juju2143, Thanks for teaching, /me enjoyed the lesson :)

Jun 17 <seidos>	[19:03:39] thank you juju2143

Jun 17 <seidos>	[19:03:56] C# is cool, what isn't cool is my lack of ability in programming in it

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[19:03:58] yw

Jun 17 <seidos>	[19:04:16] so what projects are you currently working on?

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[19:04:19] seidos, yeah, well see that tomorrow, we'll begin GTK#

Jun 17 <seidos>	[19:04:26] all right

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[19:04:38] it will become interesting

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:04:38] Anyway

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[19:04:47] seidos, made a bot in C#

Jun 17 <seidos>	[19:04:55] neat

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:05:01] Who will be participating in the C class?

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[19:05:01] yeah

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[19:05:06] maybe me

Jun 17 <seidos>	[19:05:09] do you guys think that ubuntu will go the way that chromium has gone?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:05:11] Cool

Jun 17 <seidos>	[19:05:20] I should probably ask in ubuntu-offtopic

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:05:44] pedro3005 suggested that I do it (when I mentioned 3 I might be interested in doing) so I expect him to be

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:06:04] hm, installing kubuntu-desktop changed a lot of defaults >:|

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[19:07:02] back

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:07:12] pedro3005, About to start the C class

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:07:23] seidos, Will you be participating?

Jun 17 <seidos>	[19:07:42] yeah, as much as I can

Jun 17 <seidos>	[19:07:46] I have to eat lunch soon though

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:08:13] Okay

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:08:32] Is everyone (all 3 of you :p) ready to begin?

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[19:08:33] me too

Jun 17 <seidos>	[19:08:40] thanks for the invite

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[19:08:42] yeah

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:09:12] seidos, np, heh

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:09:17] Okay

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:09:19] pedro3005, ?

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[19:09:28] juju2143, btw thanks for the class and initiative

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:09:41] pedro3005, ready?

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[19:09:44] yes

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:09:47] Cool

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:09:52] We'll start then

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:10:07] --------------------- May ze C Class Begin! --------------------

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:10:10] Okay

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:10:23] So, first a little background information

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[19:11:50] k

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:11:54] C is a compiled language. This means that you have the code as files, then you run the compiler on them, and it makes a binary, executable file which is, well, executable.

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[19:11:54] pedro3005, yw

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:12:18] Since you all seem to be on Linux, we will be using gcc.

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[19:12:41] Yeah, I think most of us have some minimal experience with C

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:13:06] C is not Object Oriented, although you can do a fair bit of what object orientation is with structs and functions.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:13:20] pedro3005, Ah. Well, I'll do background info anyway :p

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[19:13:33] bgs100, so it is event oriented?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:13:44] It's procedural.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:14:38] This means it has procedures/functions, and executes code in a 'normal' order.

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[19:14:58] Ok, I see

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[19:15:16] ok.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:15:21] I don't care what text editor or IDE you use, as long as you can edit and save. I'll be assuming compilation via the command line, and give the commands.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:15:27] pedro3005, Okay

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:15:39] I will be using gedit and/or vim.

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[19:15:54] vim ...

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:16:02] juju2143, ?

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[19:16:02] gedit ftw :p

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[19:16:08] nothing

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[19:16:12] emacs ftw

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:16:18] Lol, I use emacs too

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:16:24] For Common Lisp coding

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:16:45] I just generally use vim for a quick edit in the terminal.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:16:47] ANYWAY

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[19:17:01] nano lol. and ANYWAY.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:17:08] Lol

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:17:10] So yeah, open up your favorite editor and a terminal.

Jun 17 *	bgs100 [19:17:20] patiently waits

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:17:47] You might want to make a folder for this class

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[19:17:48] ok, got it

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:17:54] juju2143, seidos ?

Jun 17 <seidos>	[19:18:01] sorry catching up

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:18:07] Okay

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[19:18:10] damn I need to clean up my /home

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:18:15] Tell me when you're ready

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[19:18:32] ok

Jun 17 <seidos>	[19:18:42] okay

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:18:47] Cool then.

Jun 17 <seidos>	[19:19:06] ah a folder for this "class" as in classroom, I thought you were talking about classes

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:19:12] :p

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:19:12] Also

Jun 17 <seidos>	[19:19:15] are there classes in c?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:19:40] Would you prefer for me to pastebin the code to write or say it here line by line?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:20:04] pedro3005, Also, no swearing in class! Report to my office after class, please.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:20:06] (jk)

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[19:20:10] lol.

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[19:20:17] bgs100, "damn" is swearing?

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[19:20:27] seidos, these ARE about C

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:20:31] Yes :p

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:20:35] ANYWAY

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:20:43] I'll just say what to write line by line

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[19:20:46] ok

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:20:51] Okay, on the first line, type/copy:

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:20:57] #include <stdio.h>

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:21:40] Skip a line, and type:

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:21:45] int main() {

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:22:18] Then:

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:22:41]     printf("Hello, solar system!\n");

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:22:50] Next:

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:22:53]     return 0;

Jun 17 *	pedro3005 [19:22:54] raises hand

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:22:57] Finally:

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:22:58] }

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:23:01] pedro3005, Yes?

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[19:23:14] bgs100, is it int main() or just main()?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:23:21] int main() {

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[19:23:45] bgs100, yeah, 'cause I have this book about C and they just use main() without int

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[19:24:18] it's C by Ritchie and Kerninghan

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:24:40] It's probably the first edition; pre-ANSI C defaulted to int for functions without warnings or errors.

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[19:25:00] ok

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:25:06] Anyway

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:25:34] Well, The second edition says "main()" too but they start using int later.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:25:40] ANYWAY

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:26:02] So what you have should look like this:

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:26:07] #include <stdio.h>

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:26:07]  

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:26:08] int main() {

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:26:08]     printf("Hello, solar system!\n");

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:26:08]     return 0;

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:26:09] }

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:26:14] Everyone good?

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[19:26:18] good

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:26:23] Cool

Jun 17 <seidos>	[19:26:28] affirmative

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:26:38] Cool

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:26:42] (again)

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:26:55] Save this file as main.c , 01.c or something like that

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[19:27:10] k

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:27:35] Now, go to your terminal

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:27:46] Change to the directory of your file.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:28:04] And type:

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:28:39] gcc -Wall 1.c -o 1

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:28:57] Replacing 1.c with your filename

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:29:09] And you can change 1 to something else, if you wanted.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:29:15] want*

Jun 17 *	bgs100 [19:29:28] checks for confirmation.

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[19:29:32] what is Wall?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:29:41] It is Warnings-all

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:30:21] It means it will show you more wanrings than it normally would, like if you left out the return 0 (which it defaults to).

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:30:43] It also warns if you have unused variables and such.

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[19:30:58] ok

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[19:31:10] ok

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:31:16] Did everyone run the command successfully?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:31:19] seidos ?

Jun 17 <seidos>	[19:31:34] typing it now

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:31:40] Okay

Jun 17 <seidos>	[19:32:09] it worked, I have an executable "1"

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:32:14] Yay!

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:32:22] Now, run the command:

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:32:24] ./1

Jun 17 <seidos>	[19:32:32] it runs :D

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:32:44] Did it say "Hello, solar system!" ?

Jun 17 <seidos>	[19:32:57] yeah

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[19:33:00] yep

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:33:08] pedro3005 ?

Jun 17 <seidos>	[19:33:13] there is no reply though :(

Jun 17 *	pedro3005 [19:33:15] falls asleep

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[19:33:19] bgs100, uhm yeah

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:33:23] seidos ?!

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:33:33] seidos, Did it not print out the message?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:33:34] OH

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:33:39] I get what you mean :P

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:33:41] nvm

Jun 17 <seidos>	[19:33:41] just a joke, sorry

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:33:49] seidos, np :)

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:33:59] Okay

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[19:34:02] lol, I just imagined the solar system saying hello back

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:34:08] Does everyone here know about newlines?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:34:10] pedro3005, Lol

Jun 17 <seidos>	[19:34:17] heh heh

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[19:34:17] its voice is very manly

Jun 17 *	seidos [19:34:23] doesn't know about newlines

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:34:23] lolwut

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[19:34:29] \n

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[19:34:31] sure

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:34:59] Okay, for seidos's benefit, then,

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[19:35:24] loool

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[19:35:39] yeah, \n<

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[19:35:44] or the enter key

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[19:35:45] \n

Jun 17 <seidos>	[19:35:47] \n is newlines?

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[19:35:53] yessir

Jun 17 <seidos>	[19:35:56] ah

Jun 17 <seidos>	[19:36:01] then I guess I new about it

Jun 17 <seidos>	[19:36:03] sorry

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:36:05] seidos, Try taking the "\n" out of "Hello, solar system!\n", and compiling (running "gcc -Wall 1.c -o 1") again, and running the executable again

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:36:14] Oh

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:36:18] You knew about it?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:36:19] xP

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:36:28] ...nvm then

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:36:31] Okay

Jun 17 *	seidos [19:36:35] does it anyway as punishment for not knowing newlines was \n

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:36:46] Moving on to variables and fancier printf

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:36:49] seidos, Lol, okay

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:37:05] Before the printf, have a line that says:

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:37:13]     int a = 5;

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:37:40] Then, change the printf line to:

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:38:10]     printf("Does Mr.Solar System like the number %d\n", a);

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[19:38:51] lol

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:38:53] Er

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:38:56]     printf("Does Mr.Solar System like the number %d?\n", a);

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:39:01] Forgot the question mark

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:39:03] Sorry

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:39:08] And save

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:39:22] Tell when you're done, please.

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[19:39:58] done

Jun 17 *	bgs100 [19:40:04] patiently waits for juju2143 and seidos 

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[19:40:07] done

Jun 17 <seidos>	[19:40:33] compiling

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:40:34] seidos ?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:40:37] :|

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:40:46] I didnt say to compile yet ;P

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:40:50] didn't*

Jun 17 <seidos>	[19:40:58] oh

Jun 17 <seidos>	[19:41:02] well I did anyway :o

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:41:05] Well, uh, you're ahead

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:41:13] juju2143, pedro3005 Compile, then :p

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[19:41:22] done

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[19:41:24] did that ages ago

Jun 17 <seidos>	[19:41:25] that's a first

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[19:41:25] :p

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:41:28] pedro3005, ...

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:41:33] x|

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[19:41:35] lol.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:41:36] Anyway

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:41:43] Now run it, and tell me the output.

Jun 17 <seidos>	[19:41:44] pedro3005, snatches away my glory

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[19:41:49] bgs100, what's the difference between %d and %i?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:42:02] seidos, Wasn't exactly glory.... MORE LIKE NOT FOLLOWING DIRECTIONS!

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:42:04] (jk)

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[19:42:44] bgs100, well you don't need to go so slowly :p

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:42:53] pedro3005, They're the same

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:43:09] Says man 3 printf

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[19:43:18] julien@maelstrom:~/ctests$ ./01

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[19:43:18] Does Mr.Solar System like the number 5?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:43:20] pedro3005, Okay, I'll go faster

Jun 17 *	bgs100 [19:43:32] claps for pedro3005 actually giving him the output

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[19:43:32] thanks

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[19:43:33] waii

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:43:34] ER

Jun 17 <seidos>	[19:43:36] I wonder which one I'll remember more %d or %i

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:43:36] juju2143, *

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:43:38] Sorry

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[19:43:46] ^^

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[19:43:55] bgs100, you just can't get over me :P

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[19:43:56] %d is decimal and %i integer?

Jun 17 <seidos>	[19:44:16] but we used %d for an int

Jun 17 <seidos>	[19:44:21] at least I did, and it worked

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:44:24] After I tell you to make edits, I'll just say SCRO for Save/Compile/Run/Tell me Output :P

Jun 17 <seidos>	[19:44:38] ooo

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:44:40] seidos, %d is the same as %i , it would work too

Jun 17 *	seidos [19:44:59] is ready for more edits

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:45:03] juju2143, probably

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:45:16] "d, i   The  int argument is converted to signed decimal notation."

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:45:20] from man

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:45:21] Okay

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:45:36] So, you made a variable, a, assigned it, and used it for formatting in printf.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:45:40] So now

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:45:58] Change the line with assigning a to:

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:46:25]     int solar_system_fav = 42, a = 5;

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:46:42] And after that line, write:

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:46:51]     int ssf = solar_system_fav;

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:47:19] Okay?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:47:27] After the printf line,

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:47:35] type (multiple lines):

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:47:53]     if (a == ssf)

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:48:07]         printf("SOLAR SYSTEM LIKES!\n");

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:48:12]     else

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:48:27]         printf("DO NOT LIKE!!!\n");

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:48:34] Okay?

Jun 17 <seidos>	[19:48:49] SCRO?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:48:59] Not yet, one sec

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:49:19] I have to copy the lines into my editor (wrote them in IRC) :P

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:49:38] Okay

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:49:41] SCRO, everyone

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[19:49:56] what's SCRO?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:50:00] ...

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[19:50:05] :P

Jun 17 <seidos>	[19:50:10] arg, got an error

Jun 17 <seidos>	[19:50:12] typo

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:50:12] <bgs100> After I tell you to make edits, I'll just say SCRO for Save/Compile/Run/Tell me Output :P

Jun 17 <seidos>	[19:50:14] I put \N

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[19:50:20] oh ok

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:50:40] juju2143 ?

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[19:50:53] hm

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:50:59] What?

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[19:51:00] k

Jun 17 <seidos>	[19:51:04] and I put "print" instead of "printf"

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:51:05] Okay

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:51:09] seidos, :p

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:51:23] Maybe copy the lines from IRC? :D

Jun 17 <seidos>	[19:51:42] kevin@kevin-laptop:~/programs/c/irc-class$ ./1

Jun 17 <seidos>	[19:51:43] Does Mr. Solar System like the number 5

Jun 17 <seidos>	[19:51:43] DO NOT LIKE!!!

Jun 17 <seidos>	[19:51:47] that's my output

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:51:47] GOOD!

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:52:00] Now I'll explain some of the stuff we added.

Jun 17 <seidos>	[19:52:05] and I have to eat lunch now, bbasap

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:52:27] seidos, alright, you can read the logs when you get back, I suppose

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:52:31] So:

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:52:32]     int solar_system_fav = 42, a = 5;

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:52:32]     int ssf = solar_system_fav;

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:52:40] This adds 2 things:

Jun 17 <seidos>	[19:52:53] I'm gonna' stay logged in, if you're gone before I get back, thank you for the lesson

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:53:17] seidos, Thanks :)

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:53:28] No problem

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:53:31] Anyway

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[19:54:17] k

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:54:23] You can make multiple definitions/assignment in one "int" (or any other kind of type) statement.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:54:29] As the first line shows.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:54:42] Just seperate the variables with commas

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:54:58] And

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:55:15] Since a variable is the value it's holding, you can assign a variable to a variable

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[19:55:52] yeah

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:55:54] In this case, I just decided to make ssf a shortcut for solar_system_fav (which was demonstaarting for seidos that variable names can have underscores)

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:56:21] Although, if you changed solar_system_fav afterwards, ssf wouldn't be changed, or vice versa.

Jun 17 *	bgs100 [19:56:34] just thought of a good intro to pointers for later

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:56:41] Alright

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:57:11] Let's dive into functions and for loops.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:57:20] I'll pastebin the code, and you can copy it

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[19:57:23] one sec

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[19:58:48] for loops are cool

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[19:59:20] lol

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[19:59:23] yeah.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:01:41] Okay

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:01:46] Here we go, sorry for the wait:

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:02:22] http://pastebin.com/WT0NfqzU

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:02:44] Replace your file with that, and SCRO

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:03:42] hm, I'll add syntax highlighting next time, sorry

Jun 17 *	bgs100 [20:04:57] waits for the reporting of the output...

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:05:10] ...from juju2143 and pedro3005

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[20:05:40] oh ok

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:05:51] Well?

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[20:06:06] it only likes 42

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[20:06:38] julien@maelstrom:~/ctests$ ./01

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[20:06:38] DO NOT LIKE 0!!!

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[20:06:38] DO NOT LIKE 1!!!

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[20:06:40] ...

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[20:06:50] DO NOT LIKE 41!!!

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[20:06:51] SOLAR SYSTEM LIKES 42!

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[20:06:51] julien@maelstrom:~/ctests$

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:06:55] Good

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:07:07] Let's go through it.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:07:13] int solar_system_fav = 42;

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:07:21] This makes a global variable.

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[20:07:23] yeah I see how it works

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[20:07:29] good for loop breaking method

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:07:30] It can be accessed in any function

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:07:42] Okay

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:07:54] After that, we make a NEW FUNCTION!

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:07:58] YEAH!

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[20:08:13] you could've done just for (i = 0; i <= 50 && !solar_check(i); i++); couldn't you?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:08:23] It takes one parameter (or sometimes called argument), the integer n.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:08:27] pedro3005, SSSHHHHHH

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:08:37] ... Yeah, though

Jun 17 *	bgs100 [20:08:44] gives pedro3005 a star

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[20:08:49] :D

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:08:53] Anyway

Jun 17 *	pedro3005 [20:08:53] takes star

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:09:13] So we check if n is equivalent to the solar system's favorite number

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:09:36] If so, print it, and return 1 (representing boolean True)

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:09:53] If not, print as much, and return 0 (for false)

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[20:10:06] lol

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:10:10] Unlike most languages, C does not have special boolean values built-in

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:10:26] 0 = False, pretty much everything else = true

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:10:36] Okay

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:10:56] So, in main, we obviously make i and worked, with worked starting as 0

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:11:13] Then, the for loop,

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:11:27] first sets i to 0 (I could've put worked here too),

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:12:30] and then, like a while loop, each time checks if i is less-than/equal-to 50, and if the opposite of worked (that's what the ! does) is true (as in, it has continued to fail).

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:12:55] And each time we set worked to the result of solar_checked(i) with our current i

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:12:57] Oh

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:13:06] And each time, it increments i by one

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:13:11] I could have also done:

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:13:15] ++i

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:13:18] i += 1

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:13:23] i = i + 1

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:13:25] etc.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:13:46] So yeah

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:13:54] Everyone good?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:13:57] Any questions?

Jun 17 *	bgs100 [20:14:02] pings juju2143 and pedro3005 

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[20:14:14] bgs100, it's cool

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[20:14:24] you should speed up :p

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[20:14:26] kay

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:14:28] >:|

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[20:14:31] ...

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:14:36] (jk)

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[20:14:43] I don't know about juju2143 but I've done for loops, switches, bit of functions

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:14:56] Fine

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:15:07] juju2143, What do you know already?

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[20:15:09] pointers is a good subject though

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[20:15:26] I don't feel too comfortable around them

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:15:37] pedro3005, What about structs / arrays?

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[20:15:39] yeah, pointers

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[20:15:49] I learnt that at school

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:16:00] Want me to go to pointers?

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[20:16:02] bgs100, I read about them, but it's best to go over them again

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[20:16:18] structs / arrays need teaching too. whatever you feel needs to come first

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:16:21] pedro3005, You don't think it's best to go over loops/functions again >_>

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:16:24] Okay

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:16:42] Pointers, then.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:16:46] Alright

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:17:04] I'll make a program

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:17:06] Start a new file

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:17:09] Name it 2.c

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[20:17:12] I need aluminium foil!

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:17:23] ?

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[20:17:24] started

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[20:17:47] k

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:20:44] Okay

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:20:46] Pastebining

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:21:16] http://pastebin.com/GaQEwDuM

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:21:22] Copy and SCRO

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:21:39] Maybe I'll be explaining stuff you don't know, for once :P

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[20:22:00] i_pointer is 0xbfe1566c

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[20:22:00] i = 5, i_clone = 5, *i_pointer = 5

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[20:22:01] i = 42, i_clone = 5, *i_pointer = 42

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[20:22:01] i = 9000, i_clone = 5, *i_pointer = 9000

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[20:22:01] i = -7, i_clone = 5, *i_pointer = -7

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:22:21] Now run it again

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:22:25] And tell me the output

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[20:22:39] i_pointer is 0xbfad783c

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[20:22:44] rest is the same

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:23:12] Yes :)

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:23:30] Okay

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:23:35] Explain-time

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:23:39] Also, juju2143 ready?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:24:30] pedro3005, Well, as you've obviously noticed *i_pointer is always the same as i. i_clone is only the same as the original i.

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[20:24:56] oohh right

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[20:25:06] because *i_pointer points to i

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:25:20] The reason that i_clone remains the same is obvious.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:25:22] pedro3005, Yes

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:25:24]     int *i_pointer = &i;

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[20:25:29] whereas i_clone is just (initially) equal to i

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[20:25:39] but the changes that happen to i don't happen to its clone

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:25:54] One sec, Dad is talking to me

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[20:26:37] lol, you capitalize it

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[20:26:39] like he's god

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:28:06] No, in this cae Dad is a proper noun because I did not say "my dad".

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:28:12] case*

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:28:19] pedro3005, That is why I capitalized it.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:28:32] Anyway

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:28:44] So, take this line:

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:28:48]     int *i_pointer = &i;

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:29:08] This is assinging int_pointer the number that is the address in memory of i.

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[20:29:36] what does the * mean?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:29:45] In this case, pointer.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:29:51] pointer to and int

Jun 17 <Shadowwolf>	[20:30:27] Hi, guys.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:30:39] The bits, somewhere in your hardware, which have their voltages in various values representing the binary which represents the current value of i.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:30:47] That, is what int_pointer is.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:30:51] Hi Shadowwolf

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:30:57] I'm giving a C class

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:31:08] Er

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:31:10] i_pointer

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:31:12] failed

Jun 17 <Shadowwolf>	[20:31:16] Lol.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:31:29] pedro3005, Now,

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:31:32] let's take:

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:31:33]     printf("i = %d, i_clone = %d, *i_pointer = %d\n", i, i_clone, *i_pointer);

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:31:42] It's obvious what most of this does

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:31:45] But

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[20:32:07] prints shit

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:32:14] *i_pointer is the is accessing the address the i_pointer carries and gets the value that is there, which is the same as i.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:32:22] pedro3005, ...

Jun 17 *	bgs100 [20:32:34] takes pedro3005's star away

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[20:32:42] :/

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:32:49] Anyway

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:32:54] pedro3005, get it?

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[20:33:02] Yes

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:33:18] Yay

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[20:33:26] are pointers just that?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:33:26] Okay

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:33:44] Pretty much

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:33:56] Honestly, the concept itself is pretty simple

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:34:05] pedro3005, Alright, preparing another program

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:34:42] pedro3005, Save this is another file, too

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:34:46] ( 3.c )

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[20:35:46] (_*_)

Jun 17 <juju2143>	[20:36:38] brb supper

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:38:30] pedro3005, Pastebining

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:38:56] pedro3005, http://pastebin.com/UX8xnwBD

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:39:00] Copy and SCRO

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:39:02] brb

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[20:39:19] n = 5

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[20:39:19] n = 5

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[20:39:19] n = 1337

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:40:57] Yep

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:41:02] Do you know why?

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[20:41:32] let me analyze it

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:41:42] okay

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[20:42:06] bgs100, the first function doesn't actually change the initial variable

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[20:42:09] just its copy of it

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[20:42:16] but the second function goes right down to the roots

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:42:17] Correct!

Jun 17 *	bgs100 [20:42:29] gives pedro3005 his star back

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:42:42] pedro3005, Explain the second function more in depth, please.

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[20:43:06] it actually changes the memory location which the initial variable reflects

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[20:43:12] therefore changes the variable

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:43:23] Exactly.

Jun 17 *	bgs100 [20:43:34] gives pedro3005 a shinier new star

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:43:56] You appear to have a pretty firm grasp of pointers...

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:44:03] pedro3005, What do you know about structs?

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[20:44:26] bgs100, I'll probably recall a lot as you start going over them

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:44:32] ...

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:44:38] What don't you know? >:|

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:44:49] ...oh

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:44:50] well

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[20:44:53] I don't know

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:45:02] pedro3005, Lol.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:45:20] Anyway, structs it is, I suppose...

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[20:45:28] sure

Jun 17 *	bgs100 [20:45:40] is here, teaching a class that already knows most of the material... ;P

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:45:56] I bet I'll have a lot less of that in Common Lisp...

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:46:06] okay

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[20:46:17] (lambda x blabla)

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[20:46:17] xD

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:46:22] Fail

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:46:32] (lambda (x) blabla)

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:46:34] Silly.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:46:45] Anyway

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:47:02] I intend to also show how structs + functions is a lot like OOP

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[20:50:06] bgs100, go o

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[20:50:08] on

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:50:14] I am

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:50:17] I'm coding

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:50:35] Making the next example code

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:53:35] Alright

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:53:39] Pastebining

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:53:56] Save this in a new file

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:54:19] http://pastebin.com/YW55pamf

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:54:22] pedro3005, ^

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:54:29] SCRO

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[20:54:53] Rectangle 3x4

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[20:54:54] Rectangle 9x7

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:55:07] Good

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:55:09] Now

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:55:16] Think of rectangle as a class.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:55:23] makeRect is it's constructor method.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:55:35] printRectangle is it's sole method.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:55:50] printRectangle(rect) , rect.printRectangle()

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:55:56] Not so much difference.

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[20:56:06] ok

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:56:10] Although

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[20:56:17] it appears you created a type called rectangle

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:56:45] with classes you would have the advantage of being able to name it rect.print() without conflicting with another classes print.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:56:50] pedro3005, Yes, go on.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:57:00] Explain the typedef

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[20:57:20] hey, who's the teacher here? :p

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[20:57:25] I don't know :x

Jun 17 <seidos>	[20:57:25] I still don't really get classes, it is a nebulous concept to me, I've never heard of structs before

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:57:27] I'm asking you.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:57:31] pedro3005, Good

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:57:39] Hi seidos!

Jun 17 <seidos>	[20:57:48] Hi, I did my best to catch up

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:57:58] pedro3005 was being very impatient, so I skipped to his level

Jun 17 <seidos>	[20:58:02] but I think pedro3005 has a much better grasp of the material than myself

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:58:05] Which is not the same as yours

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[20:58:22] sorry :/

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:58:25] seidos, I will go back to your level in C in a few minutes, okay?

Jun 17 <seidos>	[20:58:27] eh, I think it's my fault

Jun 17 <seidos>	[20:58:34] I should be at his level, he learns faster than I do I think

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:58:41] No it's not!

Jun 17 <seidos>	[20:58:46] he's always passing me up when we learn python

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:58:46] He's learned some C before.

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[20:59:06] seidos, don't worry man, you'll learn it

Jun 17 <seidos>	[20:59:09] yeah, but I could've learned with him, I got frustrated at my inability to keep up with him

Jun 17 <seidos>	[20:59:23] seriously he learns faster than me, moving on

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[20:59:38] Well still, He and juju2143 knew a lot of C before.

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[20:59:49] I wouldn't call it a lot

Jun 17 <seidos>	[20:59:51] I took a class on c/c++ in college

Jun 17 <seidos>	[20:59:57] there's no excuse for me

Jun 17 *	seidos [21:00:03] weeps in bitter tears

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:00:05] heh heh

Jun 17 *	pedro3005 [21:00:10] pets seidos 

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[21:00:13] it'll be alright

Jun 17 *	bgs100 [21:00:20] tosses some kleenexes in

Jun 17 *	bgs100 [21:00:29] goes back to blackboard

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:00:44] seidos, Well, I'll get back to you in a few minutes, k?

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:00:50] no petting, that's gay

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[21:00:53] It's alright if you try to get the concept of classes into seidos' head

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:01:03] just keep going, if I think of an intelligent question, I'll ask

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:01:09] Alright, cool

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:01:21] pedro3005, Here's what the typedef does:

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:01:25] If it wasn't there,

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:01:37] Instead of rectangle rect; to declare a rectangle,

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:01:47] you'd need struct rectangle rect;

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:02:07] The typedef simply makes rectangle a shortcut for the type struct rectangle

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:02:13] this question probably isn't very intelligent, but I have choice, it has to be asked.  are we still looking at the rectangle file?typedef?  are we still looking at

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:02:18] So we save a lot of typing

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:02:20] oops

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:02:36] seidos, We are talking about the structure/type rectangle.

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[21:02:45] bgs100, so the type rectangle is simply a struct rectangle?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:02:45] Here's the pastebin:

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[21:02:51] and instance of the struct?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:02:58] seidos, http://pastebin.com/YW55pamf

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:03:06] yeah, I got the pastebin

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:03:09] pedro3005, Yes, rectangle = struct rectangle.

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:03:10] and I scro'd

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:03:12] seidos, Ah

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:03:17] Okay, good

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:03:21] typedef through me off

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:03:29] It threw pedro3005 off too

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:03:32] I searched the file for "typedef" and the search didn't find any hits

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:03:48] Okay

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:03:52] Well anyway

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[21:03:58] bgs100, I don't get why the function is type rectangle

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:04:05] So it just makes the programmer be able to type less :)

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:04:14] pedro3005, Because it returns a rectangle

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[21:04:18] oh

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[21:04:19] right

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[21:04:24] lol << failure

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:04:34] Like solar_check() return an int?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:04:43] pedro3005, C class, not C++ ;)

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:04:46] what the heck, I see typedef right there and the search didn't find it

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[21:04:51] bgs100, right right

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:04:52] seidos, :|

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:05:02] Anywayz

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:05:08] sorry, I thought I knew how to use vim, apparently not

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:05:15] seidos, Heh :)

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:05:28] IIRc you have to be before the text

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:05:32] I mean the cursor has to be

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:05:53] So

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:05:57] I thought it would highlight the hit, but it doesn't

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:06:00] sorry

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:06:03] np, lol

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:06:08] Not exactly a big deal.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:06:16] pedro3005, one sec

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:06:28] seidos, Okay, a struct is the definition of a data type.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:06:42] It has named parts of it, like for the rectangle, w and h

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:06:45] so rectangle is a data type?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:06:48] Right

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[21:06:53] bgs100, ok I understand the file

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:06:59] It's just a collection of variables

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:07:02] that makes more sense

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:07:03] pedro3005, Alright one sec

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:07:23] I think I get it

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:07:29] seidos, And makerect makes a new rectangle with the width and height specified as parameters

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:07:33] makeRect*

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:07:43] It then returns the rectangle

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:07:59] hmmm, didn't really get that until you explained it

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:08:06] printRectangle prints out a rectangle, as you've seen from your SCRO

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:08:09] so where is the declaration of the type?

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:08:11] at typedef?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:08:16] Well,

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:08:23] then rectangle makeRect is doing something with the type?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:08:26] making the struct at all made a new type

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:08:37] Without the typedef,

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:08:49] to declare a rectangle you'd have to say "struct rectangle rect"

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:09:01] whereas with the typedef you just say

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:09:06] "rectangle rect"

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:09:06] hmmm forgot about the struct rectangle { sitting at the top all by itself

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:09:21] It's just a typing shortcut, really

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:09:46] it makes sense but I can tell it's not in my long term memory

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:10:00] well go over it some more later :p

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:10:04] (jk)

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:10:35] I was going to go to some simple array stuff next, which would also give me a chance to reintroduce the for loop for seidos.

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:10:37] I'll probably have to, I still have no idea how to apply any of the things I learn to ACTUAL software development

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:10:42] Alright pedro3005 and seidos ?

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:11:14] all right by me

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:11:18] Wait. seidos, Let's say you need to represent a contact in a mail program.

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[21:11:18] bgs100, it'd be cool if you make us use this knowledge.. like, you know, exercises.

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:11:24] I read the for loop stuff

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:11:25] pedro3005, Okay

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:11:27] and scro'ed the file

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:11:37] One sec

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:11:48] yeah, that's where I always epically fail

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:11:56] :D

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:12:13] seidos, Let's say that a contact is a collection of a name and an email address.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:12:24] How would we represent a bunch of these?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:12:33] An array of structs!

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:12:41] struct contact {

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:12:45] I would've said an array

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:12:48] not with structs

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:12:56] seidos, How would that work?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:13:09] You could only have either the name or email,

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:13:09] put the info in the each element of the array?

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:13:14] oh

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:13:22] maybe a what are those called

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:13:26] multi-dimensional array

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:13:29] You'd need a struct to bring both together

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:13:41] seidos, Sort of, except with named pieces

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:13:44] struct contact {

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:13:49]     char *name;

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:13:53]     char *email;

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:13:55] };

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:14:08] typedef struct contact contact;

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:14:15] #include <stdio>

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:14:16] ?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:14:27] contact allofthecontacts[5]

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:14:37] seidos, I'm not making working code

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:14:51] Just showing a piece of how you might do it

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:14:52] lol, that figures, I was typing it out

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:15:02] Lol :p

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:15:03] Okay

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:15:06] Onto arrays!

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:15:10] typing it is probably a good idea anyway

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:15:11] pedro3005, Ping

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[21:15:14] hey

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:15:16] seidos, heh

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:15:17] Okay

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:15:20] Will make code

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:16:34] Also

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:16:47] recall that a character array/pointer is a string.

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:17:10] hmmm

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:17:23] I don't think I've heard that before

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[21:17:25] yeah

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[21:17:32] strings are arrays of chars

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:18:10] ah an array of characters is a string, that makes sense

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:18:40] wait, strings are arrays of chars but is an array of chars a string?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:18:42] Yeah

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:19:00] like array[5]=('k','f','s','i','p')?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:19:01] And don't let this confuse either of you yet, but an array is actually a pointer >_>

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:19:07] I don't know if I got the syntax right

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:19:18] seidos, Swap those parenthesis for curly braces

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:19:23] whoa, sounds deep

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:19:29] seidos, Indeed

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:19:33] But ignore that for now

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:19:48] so array[5]={'k','f','s','i','p'} is a string?

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[21:20:05] bgs100, a pointer of various locations

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[21:20:07] right?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:20:25] Close

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:20:34] All the locations are right next to each

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:20:55] in the string "abc" b is right beside a in memory, and c beside b

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[21:21:06] Oh I see

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:22:57] http://pastebin.com/3vj9XZS0

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:23:00] pedro3005, seidos ^^

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:23:05] Save that as 5.c

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:23:11] Save and Compile

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:23:14] BUT DO NOT RUN

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:23:19] DON'T

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:23:26] pedro3005, seidos ^^^^^

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:23:34] Tell me when you have it compiled

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:23:36] roger, don't run

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[21:23:41] bgs100, oopsie

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[21:23:42] too late

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:23:46] ...........................................

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:24:06] compiled

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[21:24:08] bgs100, sorry, go ahead

Jun 17 *	bgs100 [21:24:25] takes away one of pedro3005's stars and exchanges it for a ninja star, which he lightly stabs pedro3005 with.

Jun 17 *	bgs100 [21:24:33] tosses away ninja star

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:24:36] Okay

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:25:06] seidos, pedro3005 Run it like this: ./5 Ohai there Mr Solar System

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:25:17] Report output

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[21:25:34] Here are all of the command-line arguments:

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[21:25:35] Ohai

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[21:25:35] there

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[21:25:35] Mr.

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[21:25:35] Solar

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[21:25:35] System

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:25:54] No . after Mr, but close enough

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:26:03] Okay

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:26:12] Let's look at what this is doing

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:26:16] seidos ?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:26:28] seidos Did you run it ?

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:26:34] yeah

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:26:35] kevin@kevin-laptop:~/programs/c/irc-class$ ./5 Ohai there Mr Solar System

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:26:35] Here are all of the command-line arguments:

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:26:35] Ohai

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:26:35] there

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:26:35] Mr

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:26:36] Solar

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:26:37] Okay

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:26:38] System

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:26:39] that's my output

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:26:41] Good

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:26:54] Okay

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:27:12] brb, dad wants me...

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:29:04] Back

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:29:06] Okay

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:29:34] seidos, pedro3005 You will notice that the main function is taking the two optional arguments mentioned in the last class.

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[21:29:57] argc, argv

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[21:30:03] they'll need explaining :D

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:30:07] These arguments are called argc and argv (although you could name the boy and hisdog if you wanted)

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:30:14] pedro3005, good

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:30:27] Argc stands for Argument Count

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:30:33] It is the number of arguments

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:30:42] Argv is the Argument Vector

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:30:50] It is the array of strings that are the arguments

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:31:17] The first element of the argument vector is how the program was called

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:31:36] If the program let it be displayed (it doesn't),

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:31:40] it say ./5

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[21:32:07] but the problem is it isn't working good

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[21:32:08] look

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[21:32:12] pedro@pedro:~$ ./a.out

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[21:32:13] Here are all of the command-line arguments:

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:32:23] ...?

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[21:32:29] I didn't feed it any arguments

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[21:32:36] so it should say "no arguments blablabla"

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:32:43] Oh duh

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:32:54] pedro3005,

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:33:00] and seidos

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:33:07] Change:

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:33:11]     if (argc == 0) {

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:33:12] to

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:33:12] I'm with you, just following along

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:33:13]     if (argc == 1) {

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:33:30] And recompile

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[21:33:35] bgs100, wtf, why?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:33:38] Because

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:33:49] The number of arguments will always be at least one

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:33:49] because he's the teacher and he says so?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:33:53] For the reason I just said.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:34:00] seidos, lol, no

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:34:14] pedro3005, I just said it, IF YOU WERE PAYING ATTENTION (jk)

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:34:22] what were the arguments again?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:34:23] <bgs100> The first element of the argument vector is how the program was called

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:34:23] <bgs100> If the program let it be displayed (it doesn't),

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:34:23] <bgs100> it say ./5

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:34:36] seidos, Run it with no args this time

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:34:56] pedro3005, Because the argument vector will always have how to program was ran,

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:35:08] the argument count will always be at least one

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:35:10] Okay?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:35:18] Is your "wtf" satisfied? :p

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:35:30] bgs100, already did, got "there are no command line arguments"

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:35:39] seidos, Yay, good job

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[21:35:45] ok

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:35:54] pedro3005, Alright, cool

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:35:59] I still don't get why, and the code looks greek to me

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:36:04] :(

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:36:09] seidos, Okay

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:36:20] I know!  let me read it out loud once

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:36:39] If you give main 2 parameters to take, it will be passed the Argument Count and the Argument Vector

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:36:50] go ahead, but I'll still explain once more

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:36:59] I don't get what puts does

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:37:03] never heard of puts

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:37:07] I've heard of putts

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:37:11] or putz

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:37:13] I was about to explain

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:37:13] but not puts

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:37:16] roger

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:37:33] puts just prints out a string of text and a newline.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:37:36] That's it.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:38:03] It's useful if you weren't going to do any special formatting stuff with printf and wanted a newline

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:38:10] IN FACT

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:38:26] If you say "printf("Hello world\n");",

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:38:29] when you compile it,

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:38:39] gcc actually changes it into puts("Hello world");

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:38:48] :)

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:38:58] whoa how do you know that?

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:39:08] you know what the compiler is actually doing?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:39:18] Here, one sec

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:41:04] seidos, http://www.ciselant.de/projects/gcc_printf/gcc_printf.html http://nion.modprobe.de/blog/archives/680-gcc-and-printfputs-optimizations.html

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:41:24] You can check out machine with stuff like gdb and a few other programs

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:41:29] er

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:41:33] machine code*

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:42:10] hey cool, a tech blog

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:42:14] I'll add it to my reader

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:42:25] There's are lots of them ;)

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:42:25] it'll be tough getting into this one

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:42:34] yeah I know

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:42:38] :)

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:42:39] lots of blogs, period

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:42:40] Anyway

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:42:44] lol

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:42:45] I subscribe to too many as it is

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:42:48] okay, so that's how you know

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:42:52] cool, thanks

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:43:04] actually

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:43:12] I read somewhere else and tried it myself

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:43:18] That was just from a quick google

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:43:25] ANYWAY

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:43:30] CONTINUING

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:43:39]     for (i = 1; i < argc; i++)

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:43:40]         printf("%s\n", argv[i]);

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:43:51] That just prints out all the arguments, except for the first one

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:43:58] because i starts at 1 instead of 0

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:45:15] ...okay?

Jun 17 *	bgs100 [21:45:21] wonders if pedro3005 is still alive

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:45:35] ...

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[21:45:44] bgs100, yes

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:45:47] Good

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:45:50] And not a zombie?

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[21:45:56] brainsssss

Jun 17 *	seidos [21:45:58] is a zombie

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:46:02] Aw crap

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:46:07] Zombie processes!

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:46:12] killall pedro

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:46:21] $ killal seidos

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:46:25] $ killall seidos

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:46:33] Aw crap

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:46:36] Still alive!

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:46:40] I don't think your knowledge is getting into my brain

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:46:42] hey man

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:46:42] $ killall -9 pedro

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:46:45] I'm a good zombie

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:46:48] stop trying to kill me

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[21:46:50] bgs100, does that work?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:46:52] Lolwut?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:46:59] seidos, Good... zombie?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:47:02] pedro3005, What?

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:47:03] that's the problem with zombie killers, shoot first ask questions later

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[21:47:09] bgs100, killall -9

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:47:10] Lol

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:47:15] pedro3005, Yes, iirc

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[21:47:25] I always forget what iirc is

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:47:33] what is iirc?

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:47:36] in irc?

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[21:47:42] nah

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[21:47:54] if i recall correctly

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:47:55] pedro3005, If I Recall Correctly

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:47:59] yeah

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:48:00] pedro3005,

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:48:06] from man killall:

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:48:07]        Signals can be specified either by name (e.g. -HUP or -SIGHUP ) or by number (e.g. -1) or by option -s.

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:48:10] I like using pkill -stop, then you can revive him later if you want

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[21:48:23] seidos, hey, did you understand the code?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:48:27] seidos, Seriously?

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:48:43] yeah I used pkill -stop firefox

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:48:55] then pkill -cont firefox so that it doesn't use up cpu when I'm not using the computer

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[21:48:59] bgs100, one question though, why char *argv[] and not char argv[]?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:49:08] Because

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:49:11] pedro3005, not so much, I'm staring at it though as time permits

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:49:13] It's an array of strings,

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:49:16] or another way,

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:49:22] an array of character pointers

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[21:49:25] ohh

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:49:26] I've always had trouble with loops

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[21:49:26] right

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:49:33] or an array of character arrays if you like

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:49:37] well, I think I get it, loops aren't that bad, but the syntax is foreign

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[21:49:42] seidos, they're not hard

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:50:10] so i is less than 1 since i is < argc?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:50:11] pedro3005, So you have to put the pointer part (*) and the array part ([]) in to signal an array of pointers

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[21:50:14] seidos, the loop will be run while the condition in the middle is true

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:50:26] oh

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[21:50:30] the first sentence is run as the loop starts and the last sentence is run on each iteration

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:50:32] pedro3005, thanks, that clarifies

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:50:32] seidos, No, i is assigned to 1 at first

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:50:38] And then what pedro3005 said

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:50:41] so argc is a conditional

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:50:49] It's a number.

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:50:54] so the for loop is like a while loop?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:51:10] A lightly extended while loop, yeah

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:51:18] all right, that makes more sense

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[21:51:19] for (run once; loop condition; run each loop)

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:51:30] or, more specifically

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:51:42] or in detail

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:51:47] I don't get how to get the program to do the puts(...

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:51:53] pass any parameter?

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:52:04] at the cli?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:52:09] for (run once before the loop starts; loop condition; run after each loop) { body of loop, run each time }

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:52:22] seidos, ...Which puts?

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:52:48] the puts("Here are all of the command-line arguments:");

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:53:00] seidos, Yes

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[21:53:01] do something like

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[21:53:06] ./1 arguments go here

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:53:08] Just give the program some parameters

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:53:13] ./5*

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[21:53:23] yeah whatever

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[21:53:24] :p

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:53:29] Lol

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:53:44] I don't get why argc has to be 1 and not 0

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:53:47] 0 is more intuitive

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:53:51] ...

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:53:57] Becuase,

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:54:14] There will *ALWAYS* be at least one argument!

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:54:32] even if you don't type any?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:54:40] The first argument is always how the program was ran

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:54:44] seidos, Yes

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:54:47] In this case,

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:54:53] The first argument is "./5"

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:55:03] that's weird

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:55:20] yeah, somewhat

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:55:59] it's like an argument of itself

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:56:04] heh, yeah

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:56:06] all right, I think I get it

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:56:08] Well

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:56:08] basically

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:56:12] seidos, Here,

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:56:15] I couldn't write it out on my own right now though

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:56:29] without first looking at it

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:56:29] think of the argument vector as the argument to the *shell*

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:56:45] vector?  as in physics?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:56:47] or terminal

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:56:56] seidos, vector as in synonym for array

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:57:26] argument array?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:57:35] Yeah, but it's argv, not arga ;)

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:57:37] like the line typed with the arguments?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:57:42] yes

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:57:48] ah crap, you're actually talking about the code

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:57:58] ...

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:58:06] It's pretty much always called argv

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:58:17] so you're referring to *argv[]

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:58:23] and it's the argument to the shell

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:58:26] yeah

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:58:31] arguments

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:58:50] argc is counting the number of arguments

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:58:58] and *argv[] ARE the arguments

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:59:05] yes

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:59:12] that makes sense

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:59:18] yeap

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:59:22] int argc is counting the argument intrinsically?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:59:23] okay

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:59:35] seidos, ?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[21:59:39] What do you mean?

Jun 17 <seidos>	[21:59:59] all you need is int main(int argc) and you have a counter for your arguments

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:00:00] seidos, yes

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:00:08] Uhhhh

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:00:11] I think

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:00:18] I'll test it.

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:00:32] i mean right after that you have if (argc == 1)

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:00:39] well except int i;

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:00:52] it seems kind of intrinsic to me

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:01:02] Yes

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:01:11] seidos, ???

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:01:19] What do you mean by intrinsic?

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:01:28] like, it just is

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:01:34] you don't have to build a counter

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:01:38] Yes

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:01:44] You couldn't build a counter

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:01:46] for some reason, at a low level I guess, int argc is counting

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:01:50] bgs100, intrinsic is inherent, which is present in its own essence

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:02:04] pedro3005, Ah, thank you...

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:02:08] evil is intrinsic to the human spirit

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:02:10] ;)

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:02:17] Heh

Jun 17 *	bgs100 [22:02:33] gives pedro3005 the Dictionary badge

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:02:37] pedro3005, You fool!  If that were true then Jesus would've been evil, since he was human!

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:02:45] heh heh

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:02:49] Lol

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:03:01] back to C

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:03:07] I couldn't have defined it better, and I used the word

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:03:10] IT'S A CONSPIRACY

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:03:13] yes

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:03:14] Wait a second....

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:03:17] back to C

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:03:21] JESUS MUST HAVE CAUSED 9/11!!!

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:03:25] :P

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:03:30] Yeah, back to C

Jun 17 *	seidos [22:03:46] restrains himself from saying anything

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:03:51] lol

Jun 17 *	bgs100 [22:04:01] hands seidos duct tape

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:04:11] I think I get it

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:04:15] finally

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:04:21] still couldn't type it out from scratch though

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:04:25] not sure how long that would take

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:04:35] you know, I get the sense that I'm like actually learning a language

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:04:39] like Tibetan

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:04:45] Heh

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:04:51] it's a pain in the ass

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:04:57] Well, good that you get the sense that you're learning

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:04:58] well...maybe not that bad

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:04:58] LOL

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:05:13] I wish I could just download it into my brain

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:05:18] ...

Jun 17 *	bgs100 [22:05:25] plugs seidos up to the Matrix

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:05:29] I have to ask, is this the most efficient way to get what's in your brain into my own?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:05:46] That's very, very doubtful.

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:05:47] there's the zombie way

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:05:54] eat tiny bits of his brain daily

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:05:55] But it's the best we have so far, methinks

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:06:00] pedro3005, xD

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:06:06] maybe I should make some subliminal tapes on C

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:06:11] lol

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:06:22] pedro3005, But then I lose it :(

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:06:29] it might work

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:06:36] the subliminal tapes of course

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:06:38] seidos, the key is in practice

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:06:44] bgs100, assign homework :P

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:06:50] Lol, okay

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:06:50] pedro3005, genetics help too, from what I hear

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:06:56] hmm

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:06:59] yeah, I could probably use some homework

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:07:07] I need homework, and a grand sweeping project

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:07:16] I will teach you one more thing, and then give you homework

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:07:25] like a web app that I have no hope of doing on my own without coming here regularly and learning bits and pieces

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:07:40] Time to learn about.......................................................................................................................................................................SCANF()!!!!!!!!!!

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:07:43] all right

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:07:49] bgs100, oh that fucks me up

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:07:59] Lol

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:08:00] It just doesn't god damn work

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:08:07] Well fix you up :p

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:08:10] I'm going to call the file scanf.c

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:08:19] seidos, okay

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:08:25] that way if I'm programming some day and I'm like "wtf is scanf again" I can look it up

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:08:26] well go ahead and teach

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:08:31] Okay

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:08:42] scanf() is a nice quick-and-dirt input function.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:08:55] It does lots of work for you, but it easy for the user to break.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:09:02] is*

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:09:23] damn users

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:09:25] but oh well, who cares about users right now

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:09:29] lol pedro3005

Jun 17 *	bgs100 [22:09:41] gives pedro3005 the Potty Mouth badge

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:09:44] I want to write a program that predicts the next Great Depression

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:09:45] :p

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:09:54] seidos, Not quite there yet.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:10:02] Also that needs lots of Economics Maths

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:10:06] seidos, look up rand()

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:10:06] and magic

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:10:08] :P

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:10:10] LOL

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:10:13] just inputs right?

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:10:22] we can discuss it after the lesson

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:10:23] ?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:10:27] yeah

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:10:29] Okay, scanf

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:10:37] I'll write a sample program

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:10:48] k

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:14:22] http://pastebin.com/A8GU61ix

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:14:33] seidos, pedro3005 Copy and SCRO

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:15:19] bgs100, ...

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:15:31] kevin@kevin-laptop:~/programs/c/irc-class$ ./scanf

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:15:32] Type in a number: 3

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:15:32] Type in a another number: 2

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:15:32] You're number multiplied together are 6, yay for math.

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:15:34] we're gonna have to include Grammar classes in this channel

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:15:46] ???

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:15:47] What

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:15:51] is wrong?

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:15:58] You're number multiplied together are 6, yay for math.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:16:05] oh'

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:16:05] typo

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:16:14] Your numbers multiplied result in 6

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:16:15] pedro3005, fix it and be happy

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:16:17] :P

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:16:24] bgs100, go on

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:16:38] "together are" is fine, Thank You Very Much >:|

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:16:43] (jk)

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:16:46] Okay

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:16:56] Can either of you tell me how scanf works?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:17:12] pedro3005, seidos ?

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:17:15] yeah, you know, you type in a number

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:17:19] and it takes it

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:17:19] No

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:17:21] it's like the opposite of printf

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:17:22] and you can do stuff to it

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:17:24] How does it work on the inside?

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:17:35] getchar() ?

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:17:38] I dunno, I haven't even read the code yet :|

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:17:41] Well

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:17:50] It runs on pure magic, quite simply :D

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:17:56] it waits for a \n then breaks

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:18:02] No

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:18:03] or EOF

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:18:05] Here:

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:18:07] Seriously,

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:18:25] what it does (not how it works, that was a joke),

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:18:47] is go through user input looking for the pattern that you described to it

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:19:00] pedro@pedro:~$ ./a.out

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:19:00] Type in a number: a

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:19:00] Type in a another number: You're number multiplied together are -1068067396, yay for math.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:19:08] Yeah

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:19:09] scanf is doing the multiplying?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:19:11] Don't do that.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:19:14] seidos, NO

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:19:16] nononoo

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:19:25] I don't see where the multiplying is done

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:19:32] num1 * num2

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:19:33] nevermind

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:19:33] see it now

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:19:52] continuing, And then it reads in the format things ( like %d) into the variable addresses you provide.

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:20:01] bgs100, sometimes they use scanf like scanf("[shit and stuff here]")

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:20:04] you know?

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:20:09] what's that?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:20:12] ...?

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:20:16] it was all that "magic" talk

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:20:19] What do you mean?

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:20:19] with brackets in it

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:20:35] ...do you have an example?

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:20:43] I used to :p

Jun 17 *	bgs100 [22:20:48] has never seen it done with brackets...

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:20:52] well whatever

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:21:11] So, now you guys know how to get numbers as input.

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:21:14] pedro3005, you don't have a sample file with in it inside?

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:21:17] yeah scanf

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:21:17] Right?

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:21:19] got it

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:21:45] seidos, yeah nvm me, I'm crazy

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:21:46] seidos, And you need a variable to put the number into, and then you give to scanf with & in front of it's name (to get the address).

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:21:49] So

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:21:55] Are you ready for homework?

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:22:04] Yes, Mr. bgs100

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:22:27] pedro3005, You can call me Bgs or 100, it's fine ;)

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:22:39] Your homework is to:

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:22:51] Write a program that has a secret number,

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:23:10] and repeatedly asks the user for the number until they get it

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:23:19] For bonus points,

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:23:30] Tell the user whether they are two high or two low.

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:23:31] ohhh number guessing game

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:23:36] pedro3005, Yep.

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:23:43] this hw is too easy for pedro3005

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:23:45] I'll work on it

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:23:49] he's done a number guessing game already

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:23:52] Next lesson we'll be going into random numbers

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:23:54] in Python

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:23:59] it's diabolical torture for me, however

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:24:00] but python is like cheating

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:24:07] Yeah

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:24:11] You have to do it in C

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:24:22] seidos, The bonus *is* optional.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:24:24] :p

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:24:33] oh shoot me

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:24:38] bgs100, well, this game kind of begs for rand()

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:24:47] pedro3005, That will be next leson

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:24:50] lesson*

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:25:01] After you have submitted your homework

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:25:15] ok, I'll do it by the rules

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:25:16] xD

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:25:19] I will modify it with rand() and we will be learning about that.

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:25:33] ohh, idea

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:25:48] pedro3005, No skipping ahead of material just because you know more >:{

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:26:12] hey, don't try to stunt his development

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:26:18] lol

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:26:26] pedro3005, What idea?

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:26:57] oh yeah, and what about my Great Depression calculator

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:27:21] seidos, He already knows about rand() so it's not so much developemt ;p

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:27:23] Also

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:27:30] I know extremely little about economics

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:27:41] development*

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:27:45] I have a bachelors in business

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:27:46] bgs100, I'm not gonna use rand

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:27:48] that's something

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:27:52] Ah

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:27:57] not much, but it's something

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:27:58] pedro3005, k

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:28:05] seidos, More than me, lol

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:28:14] there is no existing great depression calculator

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:28:15] bgs100, a question though, like, to grab the value of something, which symbol is it?

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:28:17] just tried googling

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:28:24] &?

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:28:28] *?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:28:32] To grap the address, yes

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:28:40] not the address

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:28:41] the value

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:28:45] The get the value at the address, *

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:28:50] ok thanks

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:28:56] in front of the address

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:28:58] np

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:29:17] I'm getting "Segmentation Fault"

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:29:21] :(

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:29:45] ...

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:29:49] Geez, you do move fast

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:29:57] according to this article http://economics.about.com/cs/businesscycles/a/depressions.htm there is no single definition for a depression

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:30:10] pedro3005, PM the pastebined code?

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:30:12] I'd have to pick one :(

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:30:15] seidos, hm

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:30:35] I have two lines on my HW

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:30:40] bgs100, can you give me the pastebin of program 5 again? I lost it

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:30:41] pedro3005, are you working on your HW?

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:30:47] seidos, yeah

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:31:01] pedro3005, Did you not save it? >_>

Jun 17 *	pedro3005 [22:31:08] blushes

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:31:22] do we give the user a range to guess within?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:31:45] If you want

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:31:49] optional

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:32:02] bgs100, so... do you have it?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:32:18] ...I would have my own code *rolls eyes*

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:32:24] :D

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:32:30] I have it

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:32:45] well, can someone paste it?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:32:57] pedro3005, http://pastebin.com/fazfyKeV

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:32:59] especially since I need to leave in half an hour

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:33:12] weird it has "KeV" in it

Jun 17 *	bgs100 [22:33:13] gives seidos The Good Student badge

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:33:19] lolwut

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:33:24] Oh

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:33:26] The URL

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:33:27] the pastebin

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:33:30] yeah URL

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:33:35] seidos, Ha.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:33:36] ...

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:33:36] is that 5?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:33:40] Or should I say...

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:33:43] KEVIN?!

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:33:47] seidos, Yeah

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:33:48] haha

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:34:27] It seems a bit odd if someone ever uses my real name in IRC

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:34:54] I used to come online with my real name

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:35:03] then I was getting too paranoid about it, so I stopped

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:35:08] I never did.

Jun 17 *	pedro3005 [22:35:14] slaps C

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:35:20] Work, dammit!

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:35:32] pedro3005, C is made of iron, your slap had no effect

Jun 17 *	seidos [22:35:51] sacrifices a small animal to the C gods

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:36:01] seidos, Small?!

Jun 17 *	seidos [22:36:03] prays his warnings and errors to go away

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:36:17] You think they want like a rabbit or something?

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:36:19] there are no big animals handy

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:36:32] <look of disapproval>

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:36:32] I'd sacrifice myself, but then I would get nowhere

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:36:48] seidos, You can do it without dying...

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:37:16] bgs100, I kinda need convert char to int :p

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:37:20] All you have to do is throw yourself into malloc, realloc, calloc, free, segfault and memory hell.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:37:38] Probably worse than death anyhow

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:37:42] pedro3005, ...

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:37:50] pedro3005, ............why

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:37:57] don't ask why

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:37:59] pedro3005, PM me with details

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:38:03] is it feasible?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:38:04] Or a code pastebin

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:38:11] pedro3005, Of course...

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:38:21] how?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:38:25] There's a standard function for it.

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:38:29] oh cool

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:38:35] One sec

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:38:39] int()?

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:38:50] dang I put stdio.c and not stdio.h

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:39:12] pedro3005, This isn't python.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:39:19] :p

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:39:23] I know, I know, sorry :(

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:39:30] :)

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:39:34] if it was I'd be done

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:39:35] :p

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:40:24] sec

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:40:25] I forgot 99% of python

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:40:29] I'd still be struggling

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:41:50] pedro3005, Just use (int)(yourcharacter - '0')

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:42:20] If the character represents an integer, that should work with ASCII

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:42:34] (and unicode)

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:43:53] pedro3005, okay?

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:44:02] bgs100, see pm?

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:44:29] I got a bunch of warrnings and errors, but I don't think I got a realloc, calloc, free or segfault

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:44:44] am I in these hells and don't realize it?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:46:35] ...no

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:46:42] You very very veyr ceryainly should not be

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:46:50] Uh

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:46:53] very certainly*

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:50:44] ALSO

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:50:47] pedro3005, seidos

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:50:59] here

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:51:10] I would prefer if the number at least could be 2 digit.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:51:24] Also, do both of you have manpages-dev installed?

Jun 17 *	seidos [22:51:35] isn't sure

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:52:04] I'm installing now

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:52:25] Okay

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:52:27] pedro3005, do you?

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:52:31] weird it didn't ask me to confirm

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:52:31] yes

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:52:45] seidos, With small packages it often doesn't

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:52:48] Okay

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:52:50] I can't even get my program to compile for a single digit number

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:52:55] run the command:

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:52:59] man sscanf

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:53:09] Just in case you want to do anything special

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[22:53:23] seidos, PM Pastebind code?

Jun 17 *	bgs100 [22:54:28] waits for reponse

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:54:36] sorry it took so long

Jun 17 <seidos>	[22:54:54] if it looks bad now, I actually worked on it to improve it :|

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[22:59:36] bgs100, done

Jun 17 <seidos>	[23:00:02] all right, only one warning now

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[23:00:16] :|

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[23:00:22] pedro3005, PM me code

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[23:02:20] Okay

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[23:03:28] bgs100, give an assignment that uses structs

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[23:04:15] Style/Format: Good, could use a little work.

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[23:04:22] (grading pedro's first submission)

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[23:04:48] Meets specifications: Yes, including the bonus

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[23:05:27] Other: Eh, there was a missing return and unnecessary variable

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[23:05:38] Overall grade: A-/A

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[23:05:40] who gives a damn about returns

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[23:05:43] :P

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[23:05:44] ...

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[23:05:45] I DO

Jun 17 <seidos>	[23:05:55] when's the deadline?

Jun 17 *	bgs100 [23:05:58] smites pedro3005 with lightning

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[23:06:01] guess I'll work on an AI for it tomorrow

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[23:06:04] bed time for me now

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[23:06:08] seidos, Next lesson

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[23:06:12] AI?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[23:06:15] pedro3005, Night

Jun 17 <seidos>	[23:06:20] night pedro3005

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[23:06:22] bgs100, yeah so the computer guesses your number

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[23:06:29] and not the oh-so-boring inverse

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[23:06:43] :D

Jun 17 <pedro3005>	[23:06:51] thanks for the lesson bgs100

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[23:06:53] Lol, logival steps make that pretty easy, but yeah :D

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[23:06:58] pedro3005, np, I had fun

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[23:07:06] Hopefully you did too

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[23:08:27] OH CRAP

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[23:08:37] seidos, Do you have the logs for this lesson?

Jun 17 <seidos>	[23:08:50] no, but I went back and read everything already

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[23:09:00] I mean for the channel

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[23:09:12] mohi2911 likes logs of the classes

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[23:09:21] And agreed, they are important

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[23:09:30] So those who weren't present can benefit

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[23:09:37] Hm

Jun 17 <seidos>	[23:28:38] I've read logs from this channel before

Jun 17 <seidos>	[23:28:41] bgs100 ^^

Jun 17 <seidos>	[23:28:44] aren't they on the web?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[23:29:00] Somehow has to upload them...

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[23:29:04] Someone*

Jun 17 <seidos>	[23:29:09] ah

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[23:29:10] Also, idk

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[23:29:24] And to upload 'em someone has to have them...

Jun 17 <seidos>	[23:29:35] I think I might have them

Jun 17 <seidos>	[23:30:23] hmmm I can't find the xchat folder

Jun 17 <seidos>	[23:30:44] ah there it is

Jun 17 <seidos>	[23:31:10] I have logs back to feb 17

Jun 17 <seidos>	[23:31:11] :o

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[23:32:38] Lol okay

Jun 17 <seidos>	[23:33:32] do you need me to paste what I have for today somewhere?

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[23:35:04] No

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[23:35:10] mohi2911 will want itlater

Jun 17 <bgs100>	[23:35:14] it later*

Jun 17 <seidos>	[23:35:30] all right
