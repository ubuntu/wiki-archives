==== Notes ====
'''Breezy'''

Sound:
* No sound in breezy yet volume buttons appear to work

'''Dapper Final'''

Sound:
* For head phones to work you require Alsa 1.0.11 and to use "options snd-hda-intel model=laptop-eapd" in your /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base
http://tech.givemethe.net/node/41
* Hardware volume buttons work but "mute" from turning down as far as possible still makes sound,
whereas the mute button does as advertised.
* Etiquette button doesn't appear to do anything noticeable, including in windows (maybe i broke it?)
* 3D sound doesn't appear to do anything. (does work in windows)

Card reader:
* Only tested with SD card, worked well.

Remote Control:
* Surprised this generally worked, havent tried it with a dvd yet to test Skip forward, back, etc.
