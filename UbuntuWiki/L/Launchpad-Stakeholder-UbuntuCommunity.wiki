=== Feature Requests to Rework as Bug Escalations ===
1. Only Series Tasks
** Tracked at:
*** https://dev.launchpad.net/LEP/OnlySeriesTasks
*** 20111103 - https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/other-p-bugtaskseries
*** Bugs 314432, 777861, ...
** Rationale:  Many times bugs are specific to a particular version of Ubuntu, but this  is not tracked by Launchpad.  We work around this by tagging bugs with the release codename but this is done inconsistently (apport will include the tag automatically, but non-apport filed bugs don't).  There are various bugs, features, and usability issues for which being able to segregate bugs by series would be a possible solution.
** Status:
*** Francis says, "We think this can be completed by our maintenance squads."  So, next step is to try escalating this as a bug.
1. Temporarily adding the uploader as a bug contact for the package being uploaded
** Tracked:  Bug:3882
** Rationale: Our development model is such that packages are often uploaded by a developer who has no ongoing relationship with the package.  Because they do not receive bug reports for the package, it is easy for them to be unaware of having introduced a regression.
** Status:
** Francis says, "That look small enough that it could be completed as an escalated bug."
