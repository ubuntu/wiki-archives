==== Notes ====
===== Wireless =====
* To make wireless front led work (and (de)activate the radio) I just open/created(if does not exist) this file:
 <pre>
~$ sudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/ipw2200
</pre>
 and add this line:
 <pre>
options ipw2200 led=1
</pre>
 and after restart the led worked just fine (tip from AcerAspire1694WLMi).
