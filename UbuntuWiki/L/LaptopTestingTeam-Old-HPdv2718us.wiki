=== Current Issues ===

THIS WIKI/SERVER IS TOO SLOW -- UBUNTU TEAM, HOPEFULLY YOU ARE READING.  Until this problem is fixed, the rest of the work will be documented at http://nohair.com/code/computers:ubuntu:hp_pavilion_dv2718us

8.04 beta: Same as 7.10, doesn't recognize the video or wireless.  But sound works.  Applications> System Tools > Hardware Testing freezes at mouse test.  USB flash drive support shows two icons on desktop.  One icon remains even after unmounting.  Windows hardrive is always on desktop and only root can unmount.

7.10 (Gusty Gibbons): Same as 8.04, and additionally, USB flash drive support shows two icons on desktop.  One icon remains even after unmounting.  Windows hardrive is always on desktop and only root can unmount.

6.06 LTS: X fails "screen not found", safe graphic mode works, no sound, no wireless, no NIC.  Too many problems, aborting testing.
