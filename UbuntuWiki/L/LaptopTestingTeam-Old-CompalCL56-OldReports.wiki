| External monitor works?
| Yes, but resolution/refreshrate is wrong. It is a  very old monitor however, so that may be part of the problem.

==== Notes ====

[1] I've upgraded the BIOS to version 1.40.T1 (02/18/2005), which enables the software wireless switch by default. With older BIOS versions the acerhk kernel module is probably required to enable the software wireless switch, see <nowiki>[[LaptopTestingTeam-CompalCL56]]</nowiki> for instructions how to do this.
