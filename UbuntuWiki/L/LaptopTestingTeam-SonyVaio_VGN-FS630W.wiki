==== Notes ====
Caveat: The installation is flawless however, Breezy will suggest a size for WinXP partition which is too small for WinXP to work, so give it an extra 2GB. Also note that Breezy will take up the rest of the disk (65GB). 30GB should be enough and will leave room for other distros/versions.

First the simplest thing you need to fix is rebooting. The machine will do a shutdown and then just hang. To fix this, add "reboot=h" at the end of your kernel line in grub. Mine is as follows:

'''kernel          /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.12-10-686 root=/dev/hda3 ro quiet splash reboot=h acpi_sleep=s3_bios,s3_mode'''

The acpi_sleep=... in the line above seems to help when waking the machine from a suspend to ram but it is still not 100% reliable.

The touchpad will work out of the box but you will not have scrolling and corner taps.
Do the following:

1. Create file as sudo: '''sudo nano /etc/udev/alps.rules'''

2.Enter followng line: '''BUS="serio", SYSFS{description}="i8042 Aux Port", KERNEL="event?", SYMLINK="input/alps"'''

(The above two steps will ensure that your touchpad will not bet messed up when adding or removing a usb mouse.)

3. Now edit your /etc/X11/xorg.conf file to include the following:

<pre>
Section "InputDevice"
        Identifier      "Configured Mouse"
        Driver          "mouse"
        Option          "CorePointer"
        Option          "Device"                "/dev/input/mice"
        Option          "Protocol"              "ImPS/2"
        Option          "Emulate3Buttons"       "true"
        Option          "ZAxisMapping"          "4 5"
EndSection

Section "InputDevice"
        Identifier      "Synaptics Touchpad"
        Driver          "synaptics"
        Option "AlwaysCore"
        Option "Device" "/dev/input/alps"
        Option "Protocol" "event"
        Option "LeftEdge" "120"
        Option "RightEdge" "830"
        Option "TopEdge" "120"
        Option "BottomEdge" "650"
        Option "FingerLow" "14"
        Option "FingerHigh" "15"
        Option "MaxTapTime" "180"
        Option "MaxTapMove" "110"
        Option "ClickTime" "0"
        Option "EmulateMidButtonTime" "75"
        Option "VertScrollDelta" "10"
        Option "HorizScrollDelta" "0"
        Option "MinSpeed" "0.45"
        Option "MaxSpeed" "0.75"
        Option "AccelFactor" "0.020"
        Option "EdgeMotionMinSpeed" "200"
        Option "EdgeMotionMaxSpeed" "200"
        Option "UpDownScrolling" "1"
        Option "CircularScrolling" "0"
        Option "CircScrollDelta" "0.1"
        Option "CircScrollTrigger" "2"
        Option "SHMConfig" "true"
EndSection
</pre>

Restart X and you will have scrolling plus single tap on the lower right hand corner will give you right click and single tap on the top right hand corner will give you middle click.

4. To make your FN keys work (brightness, volume, hibernate, S1 and S2) follow and implement instructions in the discussions in 

http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-335267-postdays-0-postorder-asc-start-0.html

and 

http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=88611

5. For modem to work you need to upgrade to Edgy Eft Ubuntu 6.10. Then go to http://linuxant.com and click on hsfmodem download. Use cnxinstall utility which will download, compile and install the driver. Remember to reboot after installation or else modem will not work.
