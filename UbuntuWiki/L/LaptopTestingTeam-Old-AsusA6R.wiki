== Current Issues and Regressions ===

This laptop has a big problem with usb, the usb devices stop working after a while.
You can solve it by adding boot option irqpoll. 

The integrated webcam doesn't work (no drivers), see this page for more details <nowiki>[[..-AsusA6BG16E-RWDL]]</nowiki>

In Kubuntu (Edgy) you sometimes get flashing message "LCD display on". Disabling kmilo (keyboard special keys) from kcontrol removes the messages. (This is fixed in
Feisty Herd 4)

Most special keys work now in Edgy, and the sound control keys finally work correctly
in Feisty Herd 4.

==== Notes ====

[1] People are having problems with the ATI IXP sound so this is how I got the sound working in Ubuntu 6.10 Edgy clean install: start alsamixer in terminal -> mute the external amplifier (press M) -> -> increase the master surround sound(if needed) -> quit the alsamixer (Escape) -> sound working. This issue is still the same in Feisty.

[2] Couldn't connect with bcm43xx driver in Edgy or Feisty (even after adding the windows firmware), ndiswrapper and windows drivers worked.

[3] Sidescroll didn't work out of box, only after editing xorg.conf with the synaptics driver.

[4] Reading works great at least with SD and MMC cards, writing has had some issues
in the past is improving.

[9] Dial-up modem works fine using hsfmodem from http://www.linuxant.com.
For those who still using dapper "development" get linux image from http://packages.ubuntu.com/dapper/base/linux-image-2.6.15-23-386 
but currently on ubuntu dapper official released, this is the default kernel. After that download the appropriate hsfmodem driver and do usual install step:

$ unzip hsfmodem*.zip

$ sudo dpkg -i hsfmodem*.deb

and that's it, point to Networking on the menu, give the modem path /dev/ttySHSF0, then activate. On kubuntu, the modem is detected, but after run kppp, the pppd always died out unexpectedly. I still haven't know the reason of it.
