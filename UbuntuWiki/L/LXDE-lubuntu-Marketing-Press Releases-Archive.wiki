=== English : Press Release lubuntu 10.10 ===
''' lubuntu desktop 10.10 released ''' <<BR>>

Taipei/Berlin/Paris, Oct. 10, 2010: Following intensive development Julien Lavergne, developement lead of lubuntu, announced version 10.10 of the lightweight desktop on October 10, 2010. lubuntu is a faster, more lightweight and energy saving Ubuntu variant using LXDE, the Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment. It includes a special selection of light applications combining easy usability and performance. <<BR>>

lubuntu is targeted at "normal" PC users running on low-spec hardware. Improvements of the latest lubuntu version include autologin support in ubiquity, support of install only mode in ubiquity, support for lubuntu-restricted package in ubiquity. lubuntu 10.10 comes with a completely new theme by Rafael Laguna. Lxpanel now supports Ubuntu indicators applets. Added applications and tools are Update-notifier, to get notification for available updates, Xpad, to create quick notes and Ace-of-penguins, to provide some games. Parcellite, which is not maintained upstream, was removed and Pyneighborhood was replaced by gvfs support of pcmanfm. LXtask replaces Xfce4-taskmanager for tasks monitoring. Evince is now used for reading PDF. During new installations a slideshow now describes features of the system. <<BR>>

Minimum requirements for lubuntu are comparable to Pentium II or Celeron systems with a 128 Mb RAM configuration, which may yield a slow yet usable system with lubuntu. <<BR>>

lubuntu features lightweight design work, faster boot speed and a smart choice of applications aimed at keeping resource usage low. The standard web browser is Chromium, the open-source version of Google Chrome. Besides speed the lubuntu team aims to offer the best possible compromise for new users offering easy to use application. <<BR>>

While lubuntu is developed with the end user in mind, its lightweight approach also makes it attractive to corporate users focusing on faster completion of tasks. Applications included are Sylpheed as e-mail client, Openbox as window manager, the file manager PCManFM, GPicView Image Viewer, Transmission for Bittorrent, Gnumeric for spreadsheets and Abiword for word processing. A new meta-package (lubuntu-core) is available to install only core packages of Lubuntu.  A new meta-package (lubuntu-restricted-extras) is available to install restricted packages for Lubuntu (such as flash, java and extra codecs for chromium). Additional applications are available through the packaging installation system Synaptic from Ubuntu repositories. <<BR>>

Features of lubuntu 10.10:

** Faster boot speed through integration of lxdm, LXDE display manager
** Low usage of system resources through Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment
** Lower energy-consumption
** Access to software repository through Synaptic software manager

''' faster, lightweight and energy saving desktop lubuntu 10.04 as stable beta released ''' // ''<nowiki>[[attachment:lubuntu_10_04_press_release.pdf|pdf version]]</nowiki><<BR>>''

Taipei/Berlin/Paris, May 3, 2010: Following the release of the Ubuntu 10.04 desktop the lubuntu team announces its Ubuntu based light version. lubuntu is a faster, more lightweight and energy saving Ubuntu variant using LXDE, the Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment. It includes a special selection of light applications combining easy usability and performance. <<BR>>

lubuntu is targeted at "normal" PC users running on low-spec hardware. Julien Lavergne, head of development from France, says: "lubuntu users may not know how to use command line tools, and in most cases they just don't have enough resources for all the bells and whistles of the 'full-featured' mainstream distributions".

The first official version of lubuntu is released as a "stable beta" marking lubuntu as a usable system that is yet undergoing continuous improvements to enhance user experience and speed.<<BR>>

Minimum requirements for lubuntu are comparable to Pentium II or Celeron systems with a 128 Mb RAM configuration, which may yield a slow yet usable system with lubuntu. Mario Behling, founder of the project from Berlin says: "It should be possible to install and run lubuntu with less than 128 Mb memory. For browsing the Internet without flash 64 Mb RAM is probably enough on some machines, but for other applications the speed may not be suitable for practical use."<<BR>>

lubuntu features lightweight design work, faster boot speed and a smart choice of applications aimed at keeping resource usage low. The standard web browser is Chromium, the open-source version of Google Chrome. Besides speed the lubuntu team aims to offer the best possible compromise for new users offering easy to use application.<<BR>>

Applications included are Sylpheed as e-mail client, Openbox as window manager, the file manager PCManFM, GPicView Image Viewer, MTPaint, ePDFView, the music player Aqualung, Gnome-mplayer for videos, Cheese for webcams, instant messages with Pidgin, Transmission for Bittorrent, Gnumeric for spreadsheets and Abiword for word processing. Other applications are available through the packaging installation system Synaptic from Ubuntu repositories.

While lubuntu is developed with the end user in mind, its lightweight approach also makes it attractive to corporate users focusing on faster completion of tasks.<<BR>>

Features of lubuntu 10.04 stable beta:

** Faster boot speed through integration of lxdm, LXDE display manager
** Low usage of system resources through Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment
** Lower energy-consumption
** Access to software repository through Synaptic software manager
