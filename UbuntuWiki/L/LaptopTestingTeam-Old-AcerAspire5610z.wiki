==== Notes ====
'''3D Acceleration'''
<pre>
Hardy: Minor performance regression due to the switch to GEM.
Intrepid: same as Hardy
Jaunty: Huge performance regression. If you want smooth performance you should probably disable Compiz or Kwin Desktop effects(kubuntu) or edit xorg.conf and enable UXA support. Please note that UXA is horribly unstable and a fix for it probably won't make it in until Karmic 9.10 is released later this year in October.

</pre>

'''External Monitor'''

<pre>
8.04, 8.10, 9.04: on the GMA950 desktop effects won't work with an external monitor attached. This is supposed to be fixed with a future release of the xorg-intel driver(don't hold your breath). Under 9.04 attaching an external monitor also increases the performance hit almost to the point that your system becomes unusable.
</pre>

'''Hibernate'''
<pre>
Jaunty 9.04: Waking from Hibernate will cause any 3D performance issues you may have corrected to come back. Hunting down the LP bug for this and will post a follow up as soon as I find it. Quick fix for this is to restart x.
</pre>

'''Wireless NIC'''
<pre>
HARDY: New kernel uses new firmware extractor. bcm43xx-fwcutter has been replace with b43-fwcutter.
</pre>

'''Webcam'''
<pre>
HARDY: Not a single issue. Works in every application I've tried it in.
