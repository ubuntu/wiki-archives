==== Fixing the screen resolution on Feisty ====
The VGA chipset driver is SiSM760GX
The lscpi output shows this:
<pre>
00:00.0 Host bridge: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] 760/M760 Host (rev 03)
</pre>

I manually added a 1280x800 to the /etc/X11/xorg.conf file
<pre>
Section "Screen"
        Identifier      "Default Screen"
        Device          "Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] 661/741/760 PCI/AGP or 662/761Gx PCIE VGA Display Adapter"
        Monitor         "Generic Monitor"
        DefaultDepth    24

        ....Other SubSections...

        SubSection "Display"
                Depth           24
                Modes           "1280x800" "1024x768" "800x600" "640x480"
        EndSubSection
EndSection
</pre>

==== Activating the WIFI Feisty/Gutsy ====
The lscpi output shows this:
<pre>
00:0b.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM4318 [AirForce One 54g] 802.11g Wireless LAN Controller (rev 02)
</pre>

There are 2 ways to make it run: 

1-USE THE NATIVE linux driver 

Note: This hangs the machine on boot for me -alexanderfaucher at gmail 

Note: Unstable with Gutsy 64 -TiagoBonetti
<pre>
http://boredklink.googlepages.com/ubuntuguide
You'll need the original firmware from here. To get the 64bit WindowsXP driver
ftp://ftp.support.acer-euro.com/notebook/ferrari_4000/driver/winxp64bit/80211g.zip
</pre>
2-NDISWRAPPER
Note: This oops'es ocassionally.  Also benifits from rmmod, modprobe ndis after it stops responding (assuming no oops) -alexanderfaucher at gmail
<pre>
To get the 64bit WindowsXP driver 
ftp://ftp.support.acer-euro.com/notebook/ferrari_4000/driver/winxp64bit/80211g.zip
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LaptopTestingTeam/AcerAspire5003WLCiWifi
</pre>

==== Touchpad scroll ===
add section to xorg.conf
<pre>
Section "InputDevice"
    Identifier    "Synaptics Touchpad"
    Driver        "synaptics"
    Option        "SendCoreEvents"    "true"
    Option        "Device"        "/dev/psaux"
    Option        "Protocol"        "auto-dev"
    Option  "SHMConfig"  "true"
EndSection

Section "ServerLayout"
...
	InputDevice	"Synaptics Touchpad"
...
</pre>

==== Notes ====
Will be testing other features soon but still on Feisty.
