=== Launchpadlib ===

launchpadlib is an open-source Python library that lets you treat the HTTP resources published by Launchpad's web service as Python objects responding to a standard set of commands. With launchpadlib you can integrate your applications into Launchpad without knowing a lot about HTTP client programming. 

==== Installing ====

===== Lucid =====
<pre>
sudo apt-get install python-launchpadlib
</pre>

==== Hello, World! ====

<pre>
from launchpadlib.launchpad import Launchpad
import os

server    = 'edge'
cachedir  = os.path.expanduser("~/.launchpadlib/cache")
app_name  = "Just-Testing"

launchpad = Launchpad.login_anonymously(app_name, server, cachedir)
paultag = launchpad.people["paultag"]

print paultag.display_name
</pre>

And that ( providing paultag did not change his name ) will output

<pre>
>>> Paul Tagliamonte
</pre>

Fantastic. Let's move on to some nifty features of launchpadlib. Let's take a bit of a look at paultag's details.

<pre>
from launchpadlib.launchpad import Launchpad
import os

server    = 'edge'
cachedir  = os.path.expanduser("~/.launchpadlib/cache")
app_name  = "Just-Testing"

launchpad = Launchpad.login_anonymously(app_name, server, cachedir)
paultag = launchpad.people["paultag"]

realname = paultag.display_name

print realname + "'s GPG key fingerprint(s) is/are"

for key in paultag.gpg_keys:
        print "  " + key.fingerprint

print realname + " speaks"

for language in paultag.languages:
        print "  " + language.english_name
</pre>

Fantastic. If paultag has not gone to school to pick up a new language or uploaded a new GPG key, the output should be

<pre>
>>> Paul Tagliamonte's GPG key fingerprint(s) is/are
>>>   57DC4BD33F73E0CDBA98D22AF7EBEE8EB7982329
>>> Paul Tagliamonte speaks
>>>  English
>>>  German
</pre>
