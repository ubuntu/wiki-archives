=== Current Issues ===
Dapper and Edgy:
The laptop will suspend to ram, but does not seem to completely wake up. Have tried adding acpi_sleep=s3_bios to kernel boot param, but doesn't do any good. Anyway to get info that would help without serial port? (maybe the instructions below for getting Feisty to suspend to ram will work?)

Feisty:
Can't use NetworkManager because it causes the mouse to freeze and be jumpy.
If you want to remove NetworkManager just:
apt-get remove network-manager

==== Notes ====

* : Hibernate works 98% of the time. Sometimes it won't hibernate the first try, hit hibernate again and it usually works.

* *: The builtin wifi will work with ndiswrapper, but it wouldn't work with the windows driver that came with the laptop, had to download one for bcm43xx off the web and worked like a charm. (TylerCoumbes)  In Feisty the NIC is seen, but needs to have the Broadcom microcode loaded.  There are how-to(<nowiki>[[WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx]]</nowiki>) docs out there for this. (Tas50)

* **: Sleep and Hibernate both work in Feisty if you have the proper settings in /etc/default/acpi-support. This is using the native bcm43xx driver(haven't tried with ndiswrapper) and ATI's fglrx version 8.34.8 I have not tried with open source ATI driver.

Mine works with the settings below:

POST_VIDEO=false

MODULES_WHITELIST="bcm43xx"

HIBERNATE_MODE=platform

ENABLE_LAPTOP_MODE=true
