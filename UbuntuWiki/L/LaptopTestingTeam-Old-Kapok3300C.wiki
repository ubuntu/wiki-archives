=== Current Issues ===
* Using the Freecom 24B USB CD Writer and USB mass storage devices causes sound to behave erratically. Often losing sync between speakers.
* Shutdown causes the system to halt but not poweroff. This can be remedied by adding the line "apm power_off=1" to the /etc/modules file.

==== Notes ====
 
* Updated Bios from 1.01(2482-00)-(R1.23) to (R1.31)
* Upgraded memory from 2 x 64MB PC100 to 2 x 256MB PC133, though the manual does not say they are supported. Side affect is it causes the keyboard to get quite hot.
* 3D acceleration requires building the mach64 DRI kernel module from source. I used the latest version from freedesktop.org, needed to change to a 686 kernel, install the build-essential and gcc-3.4 packages, not really worth the effort.
* Suspend to Disk requires a separate partition created by the 0VMAKFIL.EXE utility. In my opinion it doesn't offer any improvements over a full shutdown and restart.
* Supports ACPI v1.0 and APM v1.2
* Since Dapper Flight 2 on battery it switches to low power saving mode. ie the hard drive stops spinning on inactivity.
* Since Dapper Flight 6 the touchpad allows scrolling on the right-hand side.
* Works with USB ethernet adaptor.
* Works with Belkin F5D7010 PCMCIA Cardbus (via NDISwrapper or bcm43xx)
* Works with Aztel PCMCIA 10/100 ethernet card.
