=== Current Issues ===

* Wireless card driver must be downloaded from Restricted Drivers. It appears as In Use, and when you check the Enabled box, it changes to 'Needs Restart'. While shutting down, the computer displays an unclear message, explaining to go a site to enable the wireless card.

* Enabling 3D and streaming video acceleration on the integrated ATI Mobility X1250 graphics adapter is very confusing and difficult.

==== Notes ====

Overall an increase in Hardy from Gutsy in laptops performance. Unhappy with the troubles required to install Wireless Card.
