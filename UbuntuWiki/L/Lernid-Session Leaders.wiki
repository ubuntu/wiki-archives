== Lernid For Session Leaders ==

Currently Lernid does not allow you to deliver your session - it currently only supports functionality for viewers. As such, you will need to deliver your session using a normal IRC client and connecting to the classroom channel. This page explains syntax you can use to trigger special features in Lernid.

==== Changing Slides ====

Changing slides is simple. Just type in the following, and replace the number for the correct slide number:

<pre>
[SLIDE 1]
</pre>

This will cause the correct slide to automatically display in Lernid.

==== Showing Web Pages ====

If you mention a web address in your session, Lernid will automatically display it in it's in-built web browser. Just make sure you use the full `http://` address. As an example:

<pre>
Go and check out http://www.ubuntu.com to see an awesome Operating System.
</pre>
