I am a strong advocate of free and open source software, having used various Linux distributions over the last 10 years.
I ran the Ubuntu Installfest at Oggcamp 10, and an Ubuntu Demo Area at Barcamp Blackpool.
I work closely with a local Social Media Surgery to promote the use of IT in public services

'''Why Ubuntu?'''
I believe in free software, and the right for everyone to work together to improve what has come before, we should not settle for second best, we should move on and improve the experience for everyone.
