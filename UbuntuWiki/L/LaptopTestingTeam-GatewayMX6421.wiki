==== Notes ====

(1) - The Fn-volume keys work, and the Ubuntu volume dialog shows up as expected. However, when running off the live CD, the on-screen display built-in to the BIOS (which shows up in a blue window in the upper left usually) is corrupted. It does not seem to cause any issues though, and the OSD does not stay visible for long. This issue does not occur with my regular HD-based Edgy install; just when using the live CD.

(2) - The laptop WiFi does not work out of the box with Edgy Final. This is because this laptop uses the Broadcom driver (bcm43xx) which requires firmware to be extracted from the Windows bcmwl5.sys Windows driver file. The wired connection does work by default however, so if you have internet access then it is easy to get firmware. Follow the "native driver" directions here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx/Edgy. I tried several versions of the bcmwl5.sys file (3.20 and 4.10 in particular) from various online sources, and none seemed to work. Only the original bcmwl5.sys that was present on my Windows installation worked, which was version 3.10, though possibly any 3.10 version would have worked. I did not try ndiswrapper; however the driver INF appears to be in oem12.inf in the default Gateway windows install, if you're looking for it.

(3) - After coming out of sleep mode, the touchpad and audio no longer work. USB mouse and network continue to function fine however.
