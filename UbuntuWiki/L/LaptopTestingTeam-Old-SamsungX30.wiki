=== Updates ===

==== Feb-24-2007 ====
In Feisty the special keyboard buttons work best with the evdev driver.

==== Apr-10-2006 ====
As of revision 1.0-8756 of the nvidia binary driver resuming from sleep wakes the screen as well. 

==== May-31-2006 ====

The two special keys ("Info" and "Checkmark") are mapped by hotkey-setup now.

==== Notes ====

I made an error-free DSDT from debugging with IASL (placed here: http://acpi.sourceforge.net/dsdt/view.php?id=427).
Placement in /etc/mkinitramfs/DSDT.aml makes sure it gets placed in every new kernel's initrd.

Special buttons 74 and 75 were set to 127 and 129 and then mapped to XF86AudioPlay and XF86AudioNext (These Samsung keys were recently added to hotkey-setup; the mapping to browser and E-Mail are a little useless though).
