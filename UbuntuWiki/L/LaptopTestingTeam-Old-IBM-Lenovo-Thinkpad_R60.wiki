==== Notes ====

* Haven't tested out wireless yet. That should be next on the list. 

* I'm still trying to find a solution for suspend. I've applied the suspend2 patch to the 2.6.19 kernel, but it still doesn't work. 

* I'm not sure why hitting Fn + Home causes the screen to blank out. Strangely enough, the laptop is still running. Trying to get to one of the tty consoles, (CTRL + ALT + F1, etc), does absolutely nothing, either. I have to restart the laptop to get my screen back. Very strange.

* Other than those two problems, everything else is pretty good. Some of the shortcut keys don't work well, but it's not a problem since I don't use them anyway.
