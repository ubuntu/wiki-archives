__TOC__

* LoCoDirectory Status:
** 75% of teams populated
** Small issues with naming convention ( ubuntu-(iso-country-code): Teams that really want to will have to ask nicely to see if they can get their names for their teams. If bad comes to worse they will have to stick to what other name they have.
** ~locoteams-approved is restricted and further discussion on how to populate it and the reapproval process will be discussed in the mailing lists and brought in for the next meeting.
* Forum admins can decide what subdomains to use for LoCo forums.
* Ireland is now an approved LoCo.
