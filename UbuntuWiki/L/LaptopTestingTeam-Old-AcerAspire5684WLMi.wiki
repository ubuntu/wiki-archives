=== Current Issues ===
The webcam doesn't work with the newest gspca drivers, and there is a bug that spam an gspca error every second in admin console. Both in gutsy, hardy and intrepid. I tried to downgrade the gspca driver in gutsy, and then it stopped spamming the admin console (ctrl-alt-f1) and the webcam (acer orbicam) did work. I will continue testing this issue later (what version which is the first with the bug).
