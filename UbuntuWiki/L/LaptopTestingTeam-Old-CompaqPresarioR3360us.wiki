I think my mother in law picked this up from costco and used it for a few years before breaking the power jack and a USB port before giving it to me (yea, I do think of this as a thoughtful gift, even though I had to fix it)

=== Current Issues (as of Intrepid Final) ===

* 3D acceleration does not work with the fglrx module, only the generic ati/radeon module will allow you to use the display correctly. In fact, just installing the fglrx packages will cause it to only log in using graphics safe mode. I have not found a fix for this yet.

* I have not gotten suspend to work and there's a 50% chance of unblanking the screen after closing and opening the lid (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/347022). If it does not unblank, I have to hold the power button until it turns off. I have not found a fix for this.  Hibernate, however, seems to work fine.

* The touchpad scrolling doesn't work.

* Wireless works out of box during livecd usage, but after installing, you must install the restricted hardware driver using a wired ethernet connection.  After installing, you manually modprobe module b43 in order to use the wireless each time you reboot the computer. To fix this, add b43 to the /etc/modules file--create a new line at the bottom of the file and add it there. This will automatically add the module when you start the computer.
* When playing movies with totem, sound will come from the speakers and the headphone jack, even when muted.  It is very quiet, but if you turn up the volume in totem, you can hear it clearly.  If you change the volume control to PCM instead of master and mute it, movies are almost inaudible with the built in speakers, and are only slightly louder in the headphones.  I have not tried it with other media players.

=== Current Issues (as of Jaunty Alpha 6) ===

* After installing, desktop effects could be set to normal with minimal loss in performance.  After installing the updates, this functionality was broken.  At this point in time, I do not know which update it was that broke 3D accel. UPDATE: Install (or reinstall) the following packages: xserver-xorg-video-radeon xserver-xorg-video-radeon-dbg xserver-xorg-video-ati xserver-xorg-video-ati-dbg. DO NOT install the fglrx package, even though it says that it is compatible with this chipset, it will display nothing but a bunch of lines on a black screen. After installing those packages, you can do normal desktop effects, but the hardware is no where near powerful enough for 3d gaming.
* The touchpad scrolling doesn't work.  Update(4/9/09):Touchpad scrolling started working on its own.  It may have been an update that caused it to start working.
* Wireless works out of box during livecd usage, but after installing, you must install the restricted hardware driver using a wired ethernet connection.  After installing, you manually modprobe module b43 in order to use the wireless each time you reboot the computer. To fix this, add b43 to the /etc/modules file--create a new line at the bottom of the file and add it there. This will automatically add the module when you start the computer.
* Using the card reader locks up system, forcing a hard reboot.
* System will not wake from sleep or suspend, forcing a hard reboot.  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/347022)
* Sound will come from the speakers and the headphone jack, even when you mute it using the volume control button on the taskbar.  It is very quiet, but if you turn up the volume in totem (or the program that you are listening to), you can hear it clearly.  If you change the volume control to PCM instead of master and mute it, the sounds are almost inaudible with the built in speakers, and are only slightly louder in the headphones.
* When first enabling the external display, it tends to lock up X, forcing either a restart of the entire system or if you have enabled ctrl-alt-backspace, restarting X.  I will try to investigate this further.

=== Current Issues (as of Jaunty Final) ===

 
* Touchpad does not work.
* Hotplugging USB mouse did not work.  Had to switch to VC1 and ctrl-alt-delete to reboot. Then I was able to use the mouse.
* No 3D acceleration at all out of the box, live cd or installed.  See Jaunty Alpha 6 (above) for solution.
* To use wireless, you must install the restricted hardware driver using a wired ethernet connection.  After installing, you have to manually modprobe module b43 in order to use the wireless each time you reboot the computer. To fix this, add b43 to the /etc/modules file--create a new line at the bottom of the file and add it there. This will automatically add the module when you start the computer.
 
=== Current Issues (as of Jaunty Karmic Beta) ===

* Desktop effects can be set to normal with minimal loss of perfoemance.  Enabling advanced effects (desktop cube, wobbly windows, etc) will SEVERELY affect performance.  3D games are unplayable (tuxracer averaged 2-2.5 fps@800x600, all effects disabled (shadows, reflections, etc).  Problem is hardware-related, not software.  IGP 9000 is not designed for 3D rendering, it is a very basic card.
* To use wireless, you must install the restricted hardware driver using a wired ethernet connection.
* System will not wake from sleep or suspend, forcing a hard reboot.  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/347022)
* Battery monitor shows battery capacity is 100%, when in reality, is closer to 5 or 10%.  Battery life is approx 45 seconds.
* Network-manager will not remember WPA key between reboots.  I am investigating this problem.

==== Notes ====

* Unlike the other reports of linux on the R3000 and R3000z, I do not need to add any kernel params. Other had said they needed acpi=off and noapic to make the install finish. I have never needed those to get it installed.
* Shared video RAM is set to maximum (128MB) in BIOS.
* More detailed information about the system can be found <nowiki>[[http://www.angelfire.com/wv/xmorgan/LinuxLaptops/index.html|here]]</nowiki>. Click on the distro for configuration at time of testing.  Note--There are no changes between Jaunty A6 and Jaunty final.
