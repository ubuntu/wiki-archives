'''Introduction'''

Here are some the more often requests we get for 'fine-tuning' the Lubuntu installation from people. As most of these involve the use of the command line, if you are new to it, please do have a read of <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/Documentation/LXTerminal | LXterminal]]</nowiki>. When you see
<pre>
some instructions
</pre>
That means you need to type them into <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/Documentation/LXTerminal | LXterminal]]</nowiki>.

=== Work Arounds ===

If you cannot find the information listed here, please also check <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/Documentation/FAQ/Workarounds | Work Arounds]]</nowiki> for further information.

=== How to install Lubuntu Software Center ===

Lubuntu Software Center arrived too late for inclusion in 11.10. To get it please do the following:

<pre>
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:lubuntu-desktop/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install lubuntu-software-center
</pre>

This will add the 'late breaking changes' part of the 11.10 release to your system and also install Lubuntu Software Center.

It will be available in the regular repos in 12.04/Precise within a few days of 11 January 2012 according to <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/lubuntu-users/2012-January/000021.html|this email]]</nowiki> on the mailing list.

=== How to enable automatic logon in LXDM ===

In LXTerminal, run:

<pre>
sudo nano /etc/lxdm/default.conf
</pre>

and replace lines: 

<pre>
[base]
</pre>

to

<pre>
[base]
autologin=dgod
</pre>

^^replace dgod with your username

=== I don't know how to make/add a application to "start" menu. ===

Here is a small example, it begins with editing a .desktop file, which you can copy to '''~/Desktop''' if you want to have it on your desktop like in Windows.

<pre>
sudo nano /usr/share/applications/urxvt.desktop
</pre>

<pre>
[Desktop Entry]
Name=URxvt
Comment=Opens a terminal with UTF-8 and 256 colors support
Encoding=UTF-8
Exec=urxvt
Icon=gksu-root-terminal
StartupNotify=true
Terminal=false
X-MultipleArgs=false
Type=Application
Categories=Application;System;
NoDisplay=true
</pre>

Categories determine where this program will be placed in the menu.
I suggest to check and inspect '''other .desktop files''' under '''/usr/share/applications/''' to give you more hint about this.

More about this can be found from <nowiki>[[http://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/]]</nowiki>

=== Shutdown Button is missing from LXPanel, how can I add it? ===

From LXTerminal, please run this command:

<pre>
sudo nano /usr/share/applications/lubuntu-logout.desktop
</pre>

Now, copy the below content, paste it into '''lubuntu-logout.desktop''' file, Save and Exit:

<pre>
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Shutdown
Name[zh_TW]=關機
Type=Application
Comment=Shutdown or Reboot
Icon=system-shutdown-panel
Exec=lubuntu-logout
Categories=Settings;DesktopSettings
</pre>

After that, please right click on LXPanel > Add/Remove Panel Items > Add > Application Launch Bar > Add > double click on Application Launch Bar > Preferences > select Shutdown from the list and on the right and then click "Add" > Close > Close

=== I want to bind the power-button to change computer state, how do I do it? ===

In LXTerminal:

<pre>
nano ~/.config/openbox/lubuntu-rc.xml
</pre>

Locate the <keyboard> section and add following lines.

<pre>
<keybind key="XF86PowerOff">
     <action name="Execute">
       <command>lubuntu-logout</command>
     </action>
</keybind>
</pre>

Now the power-button should call the shutdown menu, where you can choose the next state your computer should go to.

-----

=== How can I create a shortcut on the Desktop ===

==== 11.10 ====

Right Click on the programme icon from the Menu, there is an option there to add to desktop.

==== Prior to 11.10 ====

Launch LXTerminal and move to your Desktop directory
<pre>
lxshortcut -o application_name.desktop
</pre>
(Of course you will want to change "application_name" to something else).

A dialog will appear and you can choose the name or the icon, set the path to the file.

------

=== How I can autostart a program when logging into Desktop ===
First you need to copy a .desktop -file to your .config folder's autostart folder.
<pre>
cp /usr/share/applications/urxvtd.desktop ~/.config/autostart/
</pre>
After copying we need to activate the starting from menu:
Menu -> Preferences -> Desktop Session Settings

Please note that the directory may need to be created first:
<pre>
mkdir ~/.config/autostart
</pre>

==== for a PCManFM window ====

<pre>
nano ~/.config/autostart/pcmanfm.desktop
</pre>

and change

<pre>
Exec=pcmanfm %U
</pre>

to

<pre>
Exec=pcmanfm
</pre>

------

=== I have an English desktop and I want calendar week to start from Monday instead of Sunday ===

Firstly edit locale file
<pre>
sudo nano /usr/share/i18n/locales/en_US
</pre>

Then change
<pre>
first_weekday   1
first_workday   2
</pre>

to

<pre>
first_weekday   2
first_workday   2
</pre>

After this you need to generate locales

<pre>
sudo locale-gen
</pre>

And logout and login, as you cant run alt+f2 application launcher without lxpanel which needs to be killed.

------

=== How do I assign certain program to open to a desktop #2 ===

In this example I'm going to show how to open Chromium browser in desktop #2, as I have it configured.

Run in LXTerminal:

<pre>
nano ~/.config/openbox/lubuntu-rc.xml
</pre>

Then you have to scroll all the way to the end of the file and locate the <applications> tag.

On new lines between it and the </applications> tag, add:
<pre>
<application name="chromium-browser">
	<desktop>2</desktop>
</application>
</pre>

Now run:
<pre>
openbox --reconfigure
</pre>
and you can start Chromium on any desktop, and it will be opened in desktop 2. Note it will not switch desktops.

------

=== I want to bind a key to lock my screen, how do I do it? ===

In LXTerminal:
<pre>
nano ~/.config/openbox/lubuntu-rc.xml
</pre>

Locate the <keyboard> section and add following lines.

<pre>
<keybind key="W-l">
      <action name="Execute">
        <startupnotify>
          <enabled>true</enabled>
          <name>Xscreensaver Lock</name>
        </startupnotify>
        <command>xscreensaver-command -lock</command>
      </action>
</keybind>
</pre>

And now Windows (Super-Key) + L  should lock the screen.

To add '''Lock Screen icon''' to the Menu and/or LXPanel, please see this <nowiki>[[http://forum.lxde.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=31300|link]]</nowiki>

=== Firefox problems ===

Whilst not installed by default, Lubuntu does fully support Firefox. If you are having problems with your Firefox installation head over to <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1193567 | Firefox optimization and troubleshooting thread]]</nowiki> for some great advice on solving issues.

=== How to install Skype ===

Menu > System Tools > Synaptic Package Manager

From '''Settings''' Menu, choose '''Repositories''' then select the second tab '''Other Software'''

{{http://i53.tinypic.com/30cszs4.jpg}}

Then select '''Canonical Partners''', Close then '''Reload'''.

{{http://i54.tinypic.com/33aqe6d.jpg}}

After that, type '''Skype''' in the search box, right click, Mark for installation then Apply.
After installation, Skype will be available under Internet Menu.  

-----
=== How to search for files in Lubuntu using GUI application ===

Lubuntu by default doesn't have a tool for search but it's easy to install one:

<pre>
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install catfish
</pre>

The application can be found:
Menu > Accessories > Catfish

Though as of time of writing, LXFind is in the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~lubuntu-desktop/+archive/ppa|Lubuntu PPA]]</nowiki> and is forthcoming shortly.

-----

=== Setting environment variables upon login ===

While <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/Documentation/FAQ/Guides#How_I_can_autostart_a_program_when_logging_in_to_Desktop|autostarting programs]]</nowiki> has been well documented, it is not entirely clear how to set environment variables upon login. A common one would be adding to your `$PATH`.

Relevant files are:
* `/etc/environment`
* `~/.xsessionrc`
* `~/.bashrc`

To understand the differences between these:
* `/etc/environment`<<BR>>This runs before anyone logs in. It is a good place to set a system-wide environment variable, for example if you have a non-standard folder that must be available in `$PATH` to everyone who logs in.
* `~/.xsessionrc`<<BR>>This runs as soon as you log in. It is a good place to set an environment variable that must be available not only to consoles (see next point) but also to GUI programs.
* `~/.bashrc`<<BR>>This runs each time you start a new console, and lasts only as long as that console is open. A console is a terminal, which you can open from the menu with LXTerminal or, for more advanced use, by pressing Alt-F1 etc. to open a non-GUI console.

If you want to add `~/bin` to your path, `~/.bashrc` will do this automatically - but only in a console. If your GUI programs need to access it, you need to set it in `~/.xsessionrc` (which does not exist by default, so you would need to create it).

To edit a file, use Leafpad from the menu. However, `/etc/environment` belongs to root so for that you need to press Alt-F2 and enter `gksudo leafpad`.

The command to add something to the path is as follows.
* To add (say) `/foo` to the path:<<BR>><code>PATH="${PATH}:/foo"</code>
* To add `~/bin` to the path (note the use of `${HOME}` instead of `~`):<<BR>><code>PATH="${PATH}:${HOME}/bin"</code>

Note that interactive non-login shells and non-interactive shells use entirely different files, but that's a more advanced Bash topic.

=== Changing to Lubuntu from another flavour ===

If you already have one of the ubuntu family installed (e.g. xubuntu, kubuntu etc) then <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/Documentation/UpgradeToLubuntu | Upgrade to Lubuntu]]</nowiki> has the details of how to switch without re-installing.

------

=== Changing running applications in panel to icons only ===

1. right click panel
2. click '''Panel Preferences'''
3. click '''Panel Applets''' tab
4. click '''Task Bar (Window List)'''
5. click '''Edit''' button
6. check '''Icons only'''

------

=== The scroll button on your mouse keeps changing the Desktop Workspace even when you're scrolling through a folder or file. ===

<pre>
cd ~/.config/openbox
cp lubuntu-rc.xml lubuntu-rc.xml.bak
</pre>
(this makes a backup file so that when you think you've messed it up you could revert it back.)

<pre>
nano lubuntu-rc.xml
</pre>

and delete the lines which says;
<pre>
<mousebind button="UP" action="click">
 <action name="DesktopPrevious" />
<mousebind button="Down" action="click">
 <action name="DesktopNext" />
</pre>

Log out and Log in back again to see the changes!

if you've messed it up and want to revert it back;
<pre>
cp lubuntu-rc.xml.bak lubuntu-rc.xml
</pre>
------

=== Right-clicking on desktop pulls up a menu that is missing the "Desktop Preferences" option and now I can't change my wallpaper ===

Instead of this:

{{http://img7.imagebanana.com/img/wkyzpj8a/Tooltip_003.png}}

you see this:

{{http://img6.imagebanana.com/img/lxscyecw/Menu_001.png}}

which is actually the `openbox` menu.

Using `lxterminal` or choosing "Run" from the menu, use:
<pre>
pcmanfm --desktop-pref
</pre>
then click on the "Advanced" tab and uncheck "show menus provided by window managers when desktop is clicked" which will solve the menu problem.

If you want to change your wallpaper, click the "Appearance" tab before you close.

------

=== Disable Bluetooth ===

This is achieved by blacklisting the relevant bluetooth modules. To find these, issue the following in <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/Documentation/LXTerminal | LXterminal]]</nowiki>:
<pre>
lsmod | grep bluetooth
</pre>
An example out would be:
<pre>
bluetooth             179900  23 rfcomm,bnep,btusb
</pre>
Using the above example, you would edit the blacklist file, again using <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/Documentation/LXTerminal | LXterminal]]</nowiki>:
<pre>
sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
</pre>
and add the following lines:
<pre>
blacklist rfcomm
blacklist bnep
blacklist btusb
blacklist bluetooth
</pre>
After rebooting, issuing:
<pre>
lsmod | grep bluetooth
</pre>
Should not find anything.

-----
=== Touchpad settings ===
Edit `/etc/xdg/lxsession/Lubuntu/autostart` with the respective values to achieve the desired result on the following.

Please note there are ''many'' more options. Looking at the man pages for <nowiki>[[http://manpages.ubuntu.com/synaptics|synaptics]]</nowiki> (the driver options), <nowiki>[[http://manpages.ubuntu.com/synclient|synclient]]</nowiki> (interfaces with the driver), & <nowiki>[[http://manpages.ubuntu.com/syndaemon|syndaemon]]</nowiki> (handles relationship between keyboard and touchpad) should reveal the breadth of them. 

You can view current settings with
<pre>
synclient -l
</pre>

More common requests include:
==== Enable horizontal two finger scrolling ====
<pre>
@synclient HorizTwoFingerScroll=1
</pre>
==== Disable tap to click ====
<pre>
@synclient MaxTapTime=0
</pre>
==== Disable coasting (scrolling after release) ====
<pre>
@synclient CoastingSpeed=0
</pre>
==== Disable touchpad while typing ====
<pre>
@syndaemon -d -t
</pre>
Optionally add `-k` to allow for modifer keys so that you can do CTRL-click, for example.

=== How to control window opacity ===
If you'd prefer to actually see through to your background windows, you need a compositing manager. <nowiki>[[http://www.compiz.org/|Compiz]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[http://cairo-compmgr.tuxfamily.org/|Cairo]]</nowiki> are two rather heavyweight solutions with lots of resource-heavy eyecandy. An alternative consistent with the small footprint of Lubuntu is `xcompmgr`. We will need to install this as well as `transset` to control the degree of opacity:
<pre>
sudo apt-get install xcompmgr transset
</pre>

To get `xcompmgr` running every time:
<pre>
sudo nano /etc/xdg/lxsession/Lubuntu/autostart
</pre>
and add the line:
<pre>
@xcompmgr -c
</pre>
which turns on translucency and soft shadows. Fading can be added with `-fD A` where `A` is milliseconds between steps in a fade.

To control the level of opacity, make sure the program you want to change is running, then use:
<pre>
transset B
</pre>
where `B` is some number between 0 and 1 where 0 is completely transparent and 1 is completely opaque. Then click on the window you want to change the transparency on. If you like fading, you may want to add `-F` to `xcompmgr` to allow for faded transitions when changing opacity.
-----
=== Change background of login screen with LXDM ===

Using LXTerminal:
<pre>
sudo nano /etc/lxdm/default.conf
</pre>
and change the value of `bg` to the ''full path'' of your desired wallpaper, such as:
<pre>
bg=/usr/share/lubuntu/wallpapers/new.png
</pre>
Logout and you should see it.
