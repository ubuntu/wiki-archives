[1] Pressing this key locks up the machine and it requires a forced hardware shutdown.

[2] The number pad keys work when Num Lock is selected, however if the keys are accessed through use of the Fn button they operate like the cursor key commands on a standard number pad and not as the number which are marked on the keys.

[3] The screen mode is not correctly detected for the install. You must boot the install with vga=771 to see all of the information.

[4] Key works and selects sleep mode, but sleep mode itself doesn't work.

[5] You can assign 16, 32, or 64 MB to the graphics card in the BIOS so the RAM available to the OS is 240, 224, or 192 MB. Gutsy runs in all configurations. Other versions tested in 192 MB.

[6] The setup key opens Acer's eSetting program which provides a Windows interface for changing BIOS options such as the boot device, BIOS password, and so on. This could be mapped to the "Boot Settings Manager", for example. However this key is not recognised by the "Keyboard Shortcuts" program.

[7] Unable to install from a live CD.

[8] It sleeps okay, but after restore, the network won't reconnect (requires hardware restart.)

[9] This key is not currently assigned to anything, nor can it be assigned to anything in the keyboard shortcuts application.

[10] This key is not currently assigned to anything, but it can be assigned in the Keyboard shortcuts application.

[11] On the first boot after install the screen resolution is set to unknown. You can correct this manually to 1024x768 for this laptop. The GDM login screen remains set to the incorrect resolution so you can only see the top left of the image. The refresh rate is set to 0 but this appears to have no adverse effect. To correct the problem you must write some sections into xorg.conf

[12] Hibernate and suspend both work and restore except that the console screens are corrupted after restore.
