=== Current Issues ===
No 3D acceleration out of the box. You have to make some tweaks to get it work. Go to the notes at the end of the page ;)

Integrated webcam (0402:5603 ALi Corp. USB 2.0 Q-tec Webcam 300) does not work. Someone started to develop a driver for it (http://www.linux-projects.org/modules/news/) but the development seems to be frozen (http://www.linux-projects.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=177&forum=3). A project had been started at http://www.actiongames.co.uk/m560x/index.php/Main_Page that aimed at lobbying and developing a driver for the 5603 webcam. It was later moved to http://sourceforge.net/projects/m560x-driver/ but looks pretty dead now as well (latest news are from April 2007).

Card reader (SD,MMC,etc.) is a Ricoh one. Seems to be unsupported.

I wasn't able to disable the touchpad (the key is not working).

=== Hardware details ===
A simple Yes means it works out of the box. A Yes* means you have to configure it to get it work. See the notes.

==== Notes ====

===== Sleep =====

The sleep button (FN+F1) does not work with the default installation. To activate it, edit /etc/default/acpi-support and turn
<code>#ACPI_SLEEP=true</code>
into
<code>ACPI_SLEEP=true</code>

===== Wifi =====

Wireless is on by default but the led is off! Please do one of the following things:

If you want led and wireless off by default create /etc/modprobe.d/ipw2200 whith this content:<<BR>>
<code>install ipw2200 modprobe --ignore-install ipw2200 && /etc/acpi/wireless.sh</code>

If you want led and wireless on by default create /etc/modprobe.d/ipw2200 whith this content:<<BR>>
<code>install ipw2200 modprobe --ignore-install ipw2200 && /etc/acpi/wireless.sh && /etc/acpi/wireless.sh</code>

===== Mail notification LED =====

It just works fine if you install the New mail icon extension <nowiki>[[[http:--moztraybiff.mozdev.org-]]</nowiki>] for Mozilla/Mozilla Thunderbird. Didn't try to look for a similar plugin for Evolution.

===== Enable 3D acceleration =====

First of all, you have to modify /etc/acpi/prepare.sh or your computer will crash when you turn it on after a sleep or an hibernation. Turn

into

if [ x$SAVE_VBE_STATE = "xtrue" ]; then

</pre>

You have to install the non-free driver developped by ATI and packaged by the Ubuntu guys. It is named xorg-driver-fglrx so use synaptic or apt-get.

If you want to use my config that just-works, please save the following code in a text file on your computer.

Save your /etc/X11/xorg.conf somewhere and then replace it by the new one I gave you: <code>sudo cp your-new-file.txt /etc/X11/xorg.conf</code>

 Note: if you don't want a English keyboard, edit this file (sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf), find the line
<code>     Option "XkbLayout"	"en"</code>
 and replace "en" by "de" if you have a German keyboard, "fr" if you have a French keyboard, "it" if you have an Italian keyboard, etc.

Reboot or restart the X server and 3D acceleration should be activated. <code>glxinfo | grep rendering</code> will tell you if direct rendering is activated or not.

If you want to configure your driver by yourself, also install fglrx-control and run <code>sudo fglrxconfig</code>. It will create a new /etc/X11/xorg.conf. Before rebooting, you must edit it and add your resolution (1280x800) which is not given by default by ATI. The Subsection "Display" should look like this:
<pre>
