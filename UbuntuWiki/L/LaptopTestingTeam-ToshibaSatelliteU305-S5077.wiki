=== Current Issues ===

Xorg crashes when attempting to run dual-screen.  This could be related to misconfiguration, but I've tried everything I can find.

ALSA sound is fixable with a patch. See:

https://bugs.launchpad.net/baltix/+source/linux-source-2.6.22/+bug/116326

Madwifi not working, hangs system on boot.  Internal wifi is working fine with wep using ndiswrapper-1.48rc1 and the stock Vista drivers from the Toshiba web site.
