==== Notes ====
* X.org resolution / refresh rate: Without nvidia-glx, it probes 1440*900 correctly. But with nvidia-glx, I have to add modeline in xorg.conf in order to work. However, there's ATI graphic model, but I didn't tested it. 
** Fixed in Dapper, probably.
* Hibernation, Sleep: Goes well, but not restores
* Dim monitor in battery: Adjustable in BIOS.
* Card readers: Memorystick reader was probed, but not works
* PCMCIA: Transcend 5-in-1 Flash reader worked, and probably others too.
* Fn+F3 key: Detected, but detected as some key combinations
* Fn+F6, Up/Dn, EMail key: They have keycodes, but I xmodmadpped that keys to work
** Not fixed in even edgy.
* Internet, User Shortcut: They fire events, but must set keycodes to use them
** Fixed in probably edgy. they generated keycodes and events.
