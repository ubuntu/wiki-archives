==== Notes ====
[1.] Wireless network works out of box. Only needed to add encryption key. <<BR>>
[2.] Integrated webcam is Foxlink.  You must download Linux UVC from BerliOS: http://openfacts.berlios.de/index-en.phtml?title=Linux+UVC  After downloading and installing, use FN + F9 to turn on webcam. <<BR>>
[3.] Fingerprint reader is LighTuning.  Still searching for appropriate drivers, some solutions, looks hopeful. <<BR>>
[4.] NVIDIA GeForce 9300M GS requires download of NVIDIA X Server Settings and NVidia binary X.Org driver ('version 177' driver).  Both can be downloaded using Add/Remove or Synaptic Manager.<<BR>>
[5.] Built-in microphone requires additional drivers.  Download latest Alsa package alsa-driver-1.0.18a, but will require additional configuration after installation.  Sound works perfectly, and a headset records just fine, but still working on built-in microphone.
