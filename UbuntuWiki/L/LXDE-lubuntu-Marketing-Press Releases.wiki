== Lubuntu Press-Department: Breaking news ==

=== Lubuntu 14.04.2 available ===

Lubuntu developers are proud to announce that – with a delay of two weeks – version 14.04.2 of the fast and lightweight operating system is now available for download via <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/GetLubuntu/LTS | this link]]</nowiki>.

Release-Manager Walter Lapchynski explains: “We had to delay the release for two weeks because of problems with X meta-packages which caused us numerous re-spins. But we wanted to do it right in order to maintain stability of existing installations and – on the other hand - roll up accumulated stable updates into updated images to reduce download requirements for new deployments.” 

Jens Leineweber, Head of Lubuntu Press-Department, adds in: “And because we want our users to experience a stable environment even for computers with low resources, we decided to not release a .2 version of the alternate installation. That's due to the fact, that we were not able to fix all the bugs brought to our attention.” 

One major issue the team is fighting with is the debian-installer that causes troubles. Once again Walter Lapchynski: “We've been asked a lot lately to stop doing alternates in lieu of netboot, but that's not really a good solution.” The Lubuntu team will now team up with the Ubuntu Release-Team and Servers Team to develop a possible low resource version of the ubiquity installer.
