We closely follow the discussion about the PAE kernel. Depending on the hardware affected, it could be big support drop for Lubuntu.

It seems that the future of powerpc will also be discussed later. We have some people interesting in this architecture, and able to test the ISO during this cycle. Depending on this discussion, we may request to add a new powerpc ISO to ISO testing.

==== Issues? ====
Not yet :)
