==== Notes ====
Kernel 2.6.28-11, 2.6.28-14 and 2.6.28-15 in Jaunty causes random system hangups/crashes. 
This seems related to wireless network traffic and looks a bit like the problems with the first kernel in Ubuntu 8.10. The crashes are *not* related to the proprietary Nvidia driver. Use kernel 2.6.28-13 or 2.6.28-16 for a stable Jaunty system.
