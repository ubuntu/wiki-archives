=== Current Issues ===
Dapper Flight 3: The therm_adt746x is not loaded by default, neither in the installer nor in the installed system. That makes the fan to stay ALWAYS off. Careful! modprobing therm_adt746x solves the problem.

==== Notes ====
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| *  = Work on the 3D Acceleration is in process. Visit <nowiki>[[http://r300.sourceforge.net/]]</nowiki> for information about the current project status.
|-
| ** = The sleep-mode is rejected by the graphic-chip. This is fixed in Kernel 2.6.14, but it's not part of Breezy.
|-
| *** = The driver for the AirportExtreme chipset BCM-4301 is reversed engineered. With a Kernel 2.6.15 and self-built modules the wireless NIC works, but it's not part of Breezy. Check <nowiki>[[http://bcm43xx.berlios.de/]]</nowiki> for more information. There is also a guide in this wiki on <nowiki>[[WifiDocs-Device-AirportExtreme]]</nowiki>
|-
| **** = Default behaviour of Fn-keys is not the same as in OS X. Their primary and secondary functions are reversed. However, this is more common with other laptops.
|-
| ***** = Sound doesn't work anymore with ubuntu kernels 2.6.15-13 and 2.6.15-14. Kernel 2.6.15-12 works fine. (Malone 29750) Update: this will be fixed in next kernel upload, says Ben Collins. Thanks!
