__TOC__

=== Introduction and Goal ===
Some packages (about 360) in the universe and multiverse components of Ubuntu aren't in Debian as well. They should be audited, because :
* They have less users and are often less actively maintained, so they are more prone to undetected problems.
* They might be of interested to Debian.

The goal of this small project is to audit all those packages and store interesting information in a database.

=== Database schema ===
* sourcepackage : source package name in Ubuntu
* version : version in ubuntu
* description : short description of the package
* origin : where does the package come from :
** package removed from Debian
** apt-get.org
** REVU
** other source (specify URL)
** unknown
* origindetails : to specify URL or more info
* homepage
* maintainer : content of the package's Maintainer field
* ITP : Intent To Package on Debian
* RFP : Request for Package on Debian
* lastchange : last action in the database about this package
* comments : additional comments
* action
** action to take regarding the package

=== Database interaction ===
* export as full text in mdt format
** be able to determine missing packages
** be able to determine packages which are now packaged in Debian
