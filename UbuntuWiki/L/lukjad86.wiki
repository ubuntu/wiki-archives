== About Me ==

I found out about Linux and Ubuntu in 2006, just after Dapper Drake came out. I was at the time using Windows 98 and was having quite a few issues with spyware and lack of quality software. Fortunately, I didn't know much about computers, so I had few habits to "relearn" when someone introduced me to my first distro, SLAX. Then I switched over to Ubuntu for my installed distro.

== Contributions to the Community ==
* Mention Ubuntu whenever possible
* Help out on the forums answering questions as much as possible
* Helping out with the Ubuntu Doc team, editing the wiki.
