==== Notes ====

I had problems with graphic: during using X11 it would sometimes freezes. The freeze was never triggered by
watching video or simple works with xterms. It was often triggered with kontact and sometimes with konqueror.
The problem happened with all drivers: vesa, radeon ang fglrx, and it happened both with ubunutu kernels and
with self compiled vanilla kernels. But now the issues is gone, but I'm not sure what change fixed it.
