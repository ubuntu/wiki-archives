__TOC__

There are a variety of super-powers which are held by the people and teams who occupy the following roles:

=== Summary of current status ===

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| SLOT
| FUNCTION
| TEAM
|-
| Owner
| root
| techboard
|-
| Distro driver
| Approve blueprints for releases
| ubuntu-drivers
|-
| Series RM
| Approve/set bug tasks for that series
| ubuntu-core-dev
|-
| Project driver (for Distro series)
| Not set independently, union of Distro driver and Series RM
| -
|-
| Bug supervisor
| Nominate bug tasks, importance, guidelines, official tags
| ubuntu-bugcontrol
|}

What we would like to do:
* Set series-specific RM to "ubuntu-release"
* If a person can upload a package, she can approve bug tasks for the series (Bug:451390)

''The following tables are incomplete and probably incorrect. They were written by analyzing the several 'security.py' files in Launchpad's lp/ and canonical/ packages. Launchpad has no good way to explain what a given role can do. Bug:506212 is probably the best bug for tracking this.''

----

Our objectives are:

1. To ensure that the people who require these privileges have them, and no one else does (for safety's sake)

2. Make it clear which roles hold which permissions, so that we don't get into a tangled mess like this again in the future

The following bug contains some additional history (we just passed its 3-year anniversary):
https://bugs.launchpad.net/launchpad-registry/+bug/174375

----

=== Notes ===

* Launchpad should have in-site documentation for what each of the roles mean
** https://bugs.launchpad.net/launchpad/+bug/701681
** https://bugs.launchpad.net/launchpad/+bug/701686
* Perhaps at least some part of this documentation should be automatically generated
* The "mirror admins" role has good documentation
