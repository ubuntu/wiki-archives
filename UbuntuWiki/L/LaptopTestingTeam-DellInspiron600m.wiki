==== Notes ====

* Attempted to toggle to an external LCD using Fn-F2 hotkey.  Monitor received a signal from the laptop, but displayed no image.  Image on the laptop LCD went blank.

* * Battery was not detected until power management settings were opened.  After that it worked fine.

* ** Network Manager applet as well and older network applet show up.  Confusing to users possibly. (Fixed in 7.04 Final.)

* *** After using the battery status Fn-F3 combination the battery status applet in the menubar dissapears.  Unplugging power to change the power status does not make it return.

^5^ With Ubuntu 7.04 final, when the VGA plug was first inserted, the external and internal screens display the same contents simultaneously. When the Fn+F8 was pressed, the display alternates between the external and internal screens (one displaying and the other blank). If you want simultaneous display, don't press Fn+F8.

==== User Comments ====

WirawanPurwanto : Ubuntu OS 7.04 is running perfectly on this laptop! I am very pleased to see the hibernation and suspend under LInux finally working smoothly on this laptop. Prior to this, I used SuSE 9.2, which was also working well. Suspend-to-RAM, however, was not usable until I installed Ubuntu 7. Now I can turn off and turn on the laptop in a matter of seconds!  I "leaned out" the booting sequence by removing services that I deemed unnecessary; as a result, I could boot up this laptop from "powered off" state in as little as 1 minute (username/password entry included!). What a shame for Windows XP!
