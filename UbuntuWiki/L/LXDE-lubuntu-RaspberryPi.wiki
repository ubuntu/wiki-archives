__TOC__

Thanks to the help of the <nowiki>[[https://ubuntu-mate.org/ | Ubuntu MATE]]</nowiki> team and their tool <nowiki>[[https://ubuntu-pi-flavour-maker.org/ | Ubuntu Pi Flavor Maker]]</nowiki>, we are now able to provide ''community-supported'' images of Lubuntu for the <nowiki>[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture | arm]]</nowiki>v7-equipped Raspberry Pi 2 Model B and the armv8-equipped 3 Model B. Note that there is no current support for earlier Pi models, since they use the armv6 chip, though <nowiki>[[https://www.debian.org/ports/arm/ | Debian]]</nowiki> does support them.

== Screenshot ==

<nowiki>[[http://lubuntu.me/lubuntu-lxqt-in-a-raspberry-pi/ | Here]]</nowiki>'s the Pi 2 Model B running LXQt in Xenial:

== Testing ==

Testing will be exploratory and non-formal. If you see a bug, please report it to the development <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lubuntu/ContactUs#Contact_Us | mailing list]]</nowiki>.

== Download ==

Downloads are available in torrent and HTTP form from <nowiki>[[ http:--phillw.net-isos-pi2- | phillw ]]</nowiki>. This is currently maintained by the folks behind Ubuntu Pi Flavor Maker and includes the other flavors as well.

== Install ==

# Download the compressed image
# Uncompress the file with `unxz` so that you're left with an .img file
# Run `tail -f /var/log/syslog` and keep it running
# Install your microSDHC into your card reader
# Look for the device name of the microSDHC to show up in the `syslog`, e.g `/dev/mmcblk0`
# Run `sudo ddrescue -d -D --force` '''''image device-name''''' (you may need to install `gddrescue` tho you can also use `dd` but this is left as an exercise to the reader)

Optionally, but recommended is to resize the file system so you have some room to do some stuff:

# Run `sudo fdisk` '''''device-name'''''
# Delete the second partition by typing d and then 2
# Recreate the second partition by typing n then p then 2 and accept any other defaults by hitting enter
# Write the partition and exit by typing w
# Reboot the system and login
# Run `sudo resize2fs` '''''device-name'''''`p2`

== News ==

The <nowiki>[[https://ubuntu-pi-flavour-maker.org/blog/ubuntu-pi-flavours-for-raspberry-pi-3/ | Pi 3]]</nowiki> is now supported! Bluetooth needs some support, though.
