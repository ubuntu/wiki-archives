__TOC__

I'm a web developer with extensive knowledge of JavaScript, PHP, SQL, CSS, (X,D)HTML, XML, XSLT, SVG, etc and projects to prove it ;-)
I'm very concerned about web security and optimisation, therefore I like doing things my way, even though it might take longer than just taking some code from the internet and use it. I occasionally do that, but not before understanding every bit of code and changing it to match my style :-)
My focus is on the design and production rather than on discussing or teaching.

I support and embrace open source because of convincing arguments based on economics, politics and social studies that show why open source has to be the next dominant software player...
