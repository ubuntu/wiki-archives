==== Notes ====

* Sound does not work after installation, use <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=489603&page=2|this guide]]</nowiki> to install.

* Wireless NIC does not work after installation, use <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/Intel_4965_AGN_WiFi_Driver/Fiesty|this guide]]</nowiki> to install. <nowiki>[[http://intellinuxwireless.org/index.php?p=iwlwifi|iwlwifi]]</nowiki> is also available but can't make it work using kernel 2.6.20-16. I <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-meta/+bug/119828|read that]]</nowiki> the driver is included in linux-ubuntu-modules-2.6.22-generic so it should work in Gutsy (will test later on).
