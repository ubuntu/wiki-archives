=== Notes and Workarounds ===

==== Touchpad ====
Doubletap and scrolling work out of the box.

==== Graphics ====
Using the standard open source nv driver results in a blurry screen image. Using the restricted drivers resolves this problem.

===== Desktop Effects =====
After loading the restricted drivers compiz works. (7.04)

===== External monitor =====
Works with the restricted drivers but I have not tried any higher resultions than 800x600. Should go up to 1920x1080.

==== Audio ====
Everything works out of the box

===== Microphone =====

==== Power management ====

===== Battery info =====
Works

===== Suspend =====
Does work with the public driver. Stops working as soon as one installs the newest restricted modules. Using the legace module suggested by envy makes it possible to suspend and resume without problems.
I have applied several hacks before using the legacy driver so I am not sure which have to be applied to successfuly suspend and resume.
 
* Settings in /etc/default/acpi-support
** Stop networking before suspending
** SAVE_VBE_STATE=false
** POST_VIDEO=false
** SAVE_VIDEO_PCI_STATE=true
** USE_DPMS=true
** DOUBLE_CONSOLE_SWITCH=true
* Added a script to /etc/acpi/suspend.d/ to reset the acpi-support values after resume
* Prevent intel_agp from loading (blacklisting)

===== Hibernate =====
I only tried it once which crashed the laptop.

==== WLAN ====
Works out of the box.

===== WPA (WiFi Protected Access) =====
Works out of the box.

==== BIOS update ====

=== Guidelines for this Wiki document ===
Please do not add Kubuntu (and other derivatives) when the same Ubuntu version is already added to the table. For example: Kubuntu has exactly the same kernel and drivers as Ubuntu so everything that works in Ubuntu will work in 
Kubuntu and vice versa. Same for things that don't work. The same reasoning applies when keeping i386 and amd64 seperated. However, with that said. Some functionality depends on the userspace which differs between ubuntu and kubuntu.
