==== Notes ====
===== How to make touchpad work =====
I followed this solution: https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/wacom-tools/+bug/377435/comments/13

===== How to make rotation work =====

Commands:
These comands can control the orientation of the screen(don't use the Catalyst propietary driver from ATI because doesn't support rotation)

/usr/bin/xrandr --orientation inverted
/usr/bin/xrandr --orientation normal
/usr/bin/xrandr --orientation right
/usr/bin/xrandr --orientation left

Here http://www.pietrobattiston.it/wiki/doku.php?id=karmic_on_hp_pavilion_tx2500#rotation_and_buttons  there is a way to associate the rotation laptop key to an script that rotates the screen from normal to left.

If you find out a way to detect the screen changing and calculate and automagic rotation button, please update this wiki.

More info about rotation for that screens: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=996830
