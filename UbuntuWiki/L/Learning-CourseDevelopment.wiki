__TOC__

== Course Development ==

Development for UCLP can be done by writing courses (to be taught in real classrooms or in IRC) or by contributing to our Moodle install at <nowiki>[[http://learn.ufbt.net]]</nowiki>

=== Courses for Live Classrooms ===

(These can also be taught on IRC)

These raw class materials are stored in bzr:

<nowiki>[[https://code.launchpad.net/ubuntu-learning-materials]]</nowiki>

The classes are written in !AsciiDoc format.

Scripts in builder/ help deploy the course structure and convert the !AsciiDoc files into other formats.

''Complete details coming soon, please drop by #ubuntu-learning or ask on the <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-learning|Ubuntu Learning mailing list]]</nowiki> if you have any questions!''

Want to jump into involvement now but not yet comfortable with our bzr+asciidoc infrastructure? Feel free to follow our <nowiki>[[Learning-CourseLayout|CourseLayout]]</nowiki> and write a course in .odt, on the wiki, or anywhere and drop by to have us review it :)

=== Moodle ===

Details coming soon.
