=== Background ===

I've been involved with Free Software since I joined a bunch of Debian fanboys in the French school École Centrale Paris.  I learnt proper usage of Debian, reported some bugs, and started contributing patches.

I applied for Debian Developer status in 2004 and spent most of my Debian time doing the maintenance of GNOME, GStreamer, and related packages as well as participating in flame^Wdiscussions.

Professionally, I've been working for a small software editor in France for 4 years, acting as the "Free Software guy" and I'm currently working for Canonical on the Ubuntu distribution.  My responsabilities at Canonical include the GNOME stack and the UME project.

=== Work in Ubuntu ===

<nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~lool/+packages|My Launchpad packages page]]</nowiki> should provide a good overview of my activities which are focused on GNOME and maemo packages.
