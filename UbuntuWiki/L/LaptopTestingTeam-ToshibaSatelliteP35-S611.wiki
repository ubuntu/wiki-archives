=== Current Issues ===
CD Live ok - install has various issues coexisting with Win XP.
(I suspect these are all 100% "pilot error" and will update accordingly):

Battery Monitor
* ''Could you expand on what this means---is there hotkey that is supposed to display the battery status;  or something else and file a bug against `hotkey-setup` or `acpi-support` depending.'' -PaulSladen

GPart partitioning table corrupt

Atho W/Less driver access
* ''Please could you expand on what this means, I can't follow it.  Many Thanks'' -PaulSladen

==== Notes ====
Will add install scenarios as developed.
Currently CD Live was impressive with the minimum WireLess connectivity and GPart usuability, web browsing etc.
Install was problematic and resulted in various aborted installs due to problems with correctly mounting Primary as root at end of HDD after Ext Logical with windows pre-installed. Grub consistently refused to access and Gpart gave no option to set partition active.
Windows access lost (due to either MBR editing or PT prob) until GRUB eventually installed.
Note that Toshiba supply brain dead W98 booted CDROM (laughingly called RECOVERY) which only (repartitions total HDD) & reverts to shipped XP/SP2 level. 
Currently pursuing FreeDOS/MBR backup and free PartLogic tools to avoid another disaster. Windows PQ7 appears to now be non-viable.
