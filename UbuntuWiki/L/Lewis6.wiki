Hello. I do digital mapping for geographic information systems. I have a background in fine arts and 
contribute to an open source mapping project http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/index.php/Main_Page.
I've mapped parts of NH, here @t http://www.informationfreeway.org/?lat=43.528955859079936&lon=-72.02669076425272&zoom=9&layers=B000F000
I am studying up on SQL, packet sniffing, and network mapping (so I can understand security vulnerabilities). Perhaps I could play around with designing SVG artwork for a project or website. I have some intermediate knowledge of Linux, Unix, and Ubuntu systems (no programming).
Till later, Chow
