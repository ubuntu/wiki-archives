==== Notes ====

AlexRoman: I work for the University of Waterloo / Computer Science Computing Facility. A client has requested that we upgrade Debian Sarge on her tablet to Ubuntu. I will perform a clean install of Ubuntu (not upgrading) and will post here any issues I will encounter and any solutions I may find for them.
