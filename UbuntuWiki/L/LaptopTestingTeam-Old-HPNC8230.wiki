==== Notes ====

==== HotkeyResearch ====
With showkeys (kb mode was XLATE):

Mute: 0x71

Volume down: 0x72

Volume up: 0x73

The laptop does not have Gnome desktop (using Kubuntu Dapper), so I could not follow those parts. But it does seem the keys get recognize somehow, though they don't work:
 
lynoure@pkunk:~$ lshal -m

Start monitoring devicelist:

platform_i8042_i8042_Kbd_Port_logicaldev_input condition ButtonPressed = mute
platform_i8042_i8042_Kbd_Port_logicaldev_input condition ButtonPressed = volumedown
platform_i8042_i8042_Kbd_Port_logicaldev_input condition ButtonPressed = volumeup
