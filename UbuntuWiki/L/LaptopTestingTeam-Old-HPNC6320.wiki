* Model: RH383EA#ABD
* Website: http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/uk/en/sm/WF06b/21675-283229-283229-283229-12434650-12387652-77951821.html (nearest model match on an English page, found the RH383EA only on HP Austria)

=== Notes ===
There are many different models of the nc6320 out there. Common amongst all of them are a 15'' non-glare display (1024x768 or 1400x1050 resolution), an Intel processor (Core Duo, Core 2 Duo or Celeron M), Intel 945GM integrated graphics chip (max. 224MB shared memory), Broadcom Gigabit ethernet (tg3 kernel driver), 802.11 wireless (Intel ipw3945 or Broadcom), and a modem with SmartLink chip. My configuration has a 1400x1050 display, Core 2 Duo 7200 (2x2.0GHz), ipw3945, 100GB hard disk, and DVD-SuperMulti-burner.

I installed Kubuntu Edgy on this notebook, so while one can assume that it also works at least as well on Ubuntu with GNOME I can't make definitive statements on that.

=== Current Issues ===
For the 1400x1050 display to work in native resolution instead of the 1024x768 one, you need the 915resolution tool to change the Video BIOS on every bootup, X.org is already working on a proper solution. For the modem to work, get sl-modem-daemon from multiverse and configure it by setting SLMODEMD_DEVICE=modem:0 and OPTS="--alsa" in /etc/default/sl-modem-daemon. Also, I didn't test the card reader, but there's no indication that it would work, I assume it not to be supported by current Linux kernels. Same with the fingerprint reader which is available on selected models.

Suspend does not currently work with Kubuntu Edgy, while hibernation does. Power management for the Core 2 Duo processors works since BIOS F.09, with previous BIOSes Linux can't scale CPU frequencies.

Other than those minor drawbacks, the notebook works like a charm. It's very quiet and seems to be worked quite solidly. The keyboard has a seperate block for the Insert/Del/Home/End/PgUp/PgDown keys and feels good for writing. The builtin notebook speakers can't match with a proper external sound system, but leave most other laptop speakers behind in terms of sound quality. And last but not least, the Intel 945GM graphics chip has a Free driver in the official X.org server, so no fumbling with proprietary graphics driver modules (even if it's not with top-notch performance, but that also saves battery time and keeps the laptop quiet). In Edgy, the ipw3945 wireless stuff still needs proprietary firmware from linux-restricted-modules, but I heard this is going to be resolved soon.

| 3D Acceleration
| Untested
| I'm not sure: glxinfo says "libGL warning: 3D driver claims to not support visual 0x5b" (which maybe stems from 915resolution usage, or maybe not), but says "direct rendering: Yes". glxgears only gets 795 FPS, which doesn't look all too accelerated. I guess X.org of Feisty or at least Feisty+1 will have that warning exterminated. Maybe everything works and accelerates out of the box with 1024x768'ed displays.
