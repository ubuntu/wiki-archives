=== Known Issues ===
==== Current Issues ====
none! :-)

==== Archived Issues ====
With Kernel 2.6.17-x the first keystroke won't respond. However, it seems to be fixed since kernel 2.6.18, so this won't occure in upcoming releases anymore.

After resuming from hibernate, the screen may stay blank. This is because of the buggy ATI-drivers. Use a driver version which is equal or higher than 8.34.3

=== Notes ===

This notebook runs very well on Jaunty. Hardware detection works for _all_ devices. You can map four extra buttons above the keyboard which are labeled as: 
* Mail Client
* Browser
* Acer e-Button
* P-Button
To map them, just go to you Gnome preferences, select an action and press the desired button.

==== Setting up the card reader ====
On jaunty, it works right away.
Write into a console:
<pre>
 sudo modprobe tifm_sd
</pre>
Since you may want to have it enabled after rebooting, add it to /etc/modules.

==== Graphics Card ====

Since Jaunty, the shipped ati-driver will work, even with 3D acceleration. However, it consumes 100% CPU all the time when desktop effects are enabled. So I recommend to install ATIs driver by going to system - system settings - hardware. You just neet to click "activate" to enable ATIs drivers.

On older versions: 
See <nowiki>[[BinaryDriverHowto-ATI]]</nowiki> for Instructions how to enable 3D Acceleration. Do use drivers > 8.32.x, or you will not be able to resume from suspend / hibernate. However, my Screen got stuck about every 5 seconds on a 32bit-system. Downgrading to 8.32.6 solved this problem. This bug did NOT occure on 64bit-Edgy.

==== Enhancing battery endurance ====
You can use it about two and a half hours by default. This is almost as much as you can use it with other (shipped) OSes.
To save some more energy, open "/etc/default/acpi-support" and set LAPTOP_MODE=true (at the bottom). You may also open "/etc/default/fglrx" and uncomment the option inside to choke graphical performance while the laptop's lid is closed.
You may do this manually, if you have ati's binary drivers installed: "aticonfig --lsp" will show you a list of available powerstates. Set one with "aticonfig --set-powerstate=x", where x is your choosen powerstate.
If I set Powerstate to lowest, my screen sometime has glitches, forcing me to switch to console and back again. Use 2 instead (out of three).

==== Wireless ====

===== Jaunty =====
Wireless works right away on Jaunty. I didn't test monitor mode yet, but on Intrepid I managed to patch the driver '''b43''', so I could use monitor mode with aircrack and/or kismet to test my wireless security.

===== Manual install =====
On older versions what you had to do is this:<<BR>>
Use <nowiki>[[bcm43xx]]</nowiki> to use monitor mode on your Wireless, or ndiswrapper for usual needs. WEP up to 128bits works out-of-the-box, WPA may be configured as shown in this thread: <nowiki>[[link me]]</nowiki>.<<BR>>
<<BR>>For regular use:<<BR>>
* Install 'acer_acpi' module, this must be done because the acer button in front of the computer doesn't work for Linux, the next steps will make the wireless card work by software like if you activate the card by pressing the button.<<BR>>
<<BR>>
1. Download acer_acpi from : [WWW] http://code.google.com/p/aceracpi/<nowiki>[[BR]]</nowiki>
2. Untar (in terminal tar -xvjf package.tar.bz2) the files like you always do with Ubuntu and in the terminal go to these files directory<<BR>>
3. Execute the next commands :<<BR>>
*** make
*** sudo make install

Everytime you want to activate your Wifi, type:
<pre>
sudo rmmod bcm43xx # (may also be blacklisted of cause)
sudo modprobe acer_acpi
sudo modprobe ndiswrapper
sudo chmod 777 /proc/acpi/acer/wireless
echo "enabled: 1" >/proc/acpi/acer/wireless
</pre>
You may put that into a script. You need to sudo these actions.

==== Suspend ====

===== On Jaunty =====
Works right away, both Suspend to RAM (S3) and Suspend to Disk. Both drivers, ati and fglrx were tested.

===== Until Hardy =====
Suspend with fglrx drivers:<<BR>><<BR>>
You must edit stuff in /etc/default/acpi-support<<BR>>
SAVE_VBE_STATE=false<<BR>>
POST_VIDEO=false<<BR>>
This changes should remove black screen of death while resuming from suspend.<<BR>>
