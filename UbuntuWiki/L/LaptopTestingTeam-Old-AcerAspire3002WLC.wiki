==== Notes ====

This was streched out 1024x768 to fit the 1280x800 wide screen <<BR>>
Open console, press at same time: Crtl-Alt-F1 <<BR>>
login as root and run: dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg <<BR>>
for autodetect select "yes" <<BR>>
for desired xserver select "sis" <<BR>> 
accept default till memory: enter 65536...xserver-xorg will enter the correct amount anyway <<BR>>
for framebuffer: enter "yes" <<BR>>
autodetect keyboard layout: enter "yes" <<BR>>
(this worked, so I left it alone. If you discover a better working keyboard, please post here!) <<BR>>
for keyboard: accept "us" <<BR>>
for XKB rule: accept "xorg" <<BR>>
for keyboard model: accept "pc104" <<BR>>
for keyboard variant: leave it blank <<BR>>
for keyboard options: leave it blank <<BR>>
emulate 3-button mouse: yes <<BR>>
Enable scroll events from mouse wheel: yes <<BR>>
Select the X.Org server modules that should be loaded by default: accept default options <<BR>>
Write default Files section to configuration file? yes <<BR>>
Write default Attempt monitor autodetection? yes <<BR>>
DRI section to configuration file? yes <<BR>>
Enter an identifier for your monitor: leave it as "Generic Monitor" <<BR>>
'''the next questions are VERY important and fixes the resolution''' <<BR>>
'''Select the video modes you would like the X server to use: 1280x800 '''<<BR>> 
'''Please choose a method for selecting your monitor characteristics: advanced '''<<BR>> 
Enter your monitor's horizontal sync range: leave the default, xserver will figure out the best <<BR>>
Enter your monitor's vertical refresh range: leave the default, xserver will figure out the best <<BR>>
Please select your desired default color depth in bits: 24 <<BR>>
when back at console, restart gdm <<BR>>
enter at command line: /etc/init.d/gdm restart <<BR>>
logback into gui<<BR>>
If this doesn't adjust screen resolution properly, reboot to correctly restart xserver <<BR>>
if you have a better way to restart the xserver without rebooting, please let post here! <<BR>>

===== Hibernate =====
Hibernate to disk seems to work, however the keyboard and mouse are frozen.<<BR>>
This hasn't been tested this after disconnecting from mains power as mentioned below.<<BR>>

However, hibernate using suspend2 is effective.  <<BR>>
Instructions are here: <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=75443]]</nowiki><<BR>>
My expererience with suspend2 is here: <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=75443&page=5]]</nowiki><<BR>>
It's a bit of work and means to recompile kernel. Follow the instructions carefully. <<BR>>
Suspend2 still occasionally get a frozen keyboard. It's most reliable after disconnecting laptop from mains power for a while: 30mins to overnight.
