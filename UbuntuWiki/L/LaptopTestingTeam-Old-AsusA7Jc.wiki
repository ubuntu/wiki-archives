1. Once the fglrx driver is installed (1440x900).
2. Tested the drivers: fglrx, radeonhd and radeon. Radeon works best on Ubuntu 64-bit, but there exist some issues (such as video overlay in a window). Needs further testing.
3. Crashes on resuming.
4. Fails while ''trying to'' suspend or hibernate. Needs further testing.
5. Muting the master channel alters the sound but have the same volume (The sound changes from stereo to mono and it sounds like music from a can). Also, audio is still hearable when reducing volume to zero.
6. Require manual ipw3945 daemon loading.
7. Not mounting my Memory Stick PRO Duo? Needs further testing.
