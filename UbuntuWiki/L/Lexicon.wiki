__TOC__

W00t...just I'm just starting out on this whole Wiki deal, so bear with me while I learn the tricks of the trade.

Thanks to some help from the guys over at the Clemson University Linux Users Group (CLUG), I was able to fix a pretty nasty problem that's been plaguing some newer laptops out there trying to install Ubuntu. 
It involves the Yukon Gigabit networking card running on the <nowiki>[[sk98lin]]</nowiki> module.
