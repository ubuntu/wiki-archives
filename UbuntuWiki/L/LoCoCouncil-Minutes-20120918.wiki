 20:10:53 <czajkowski> cm-t: so how do you get people involved in the loco, it's rather large

 20:11:34 <cm-t> we focused a lot to get new people as user, and as you espected well, now we need to focus to grow our community

 20:11:43 <itnet7> Very nice job on giving all of the details on the wiki

 20:12:01 <czajkowski> xdatap1: any questions

 20:12:24 <olive> we organize great and big events to attract many volounteers
