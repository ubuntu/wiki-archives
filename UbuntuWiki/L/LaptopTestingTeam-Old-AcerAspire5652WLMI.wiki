=== Current Issues ===
A replacement for Powermizer: Powermizer is a tool for Windows XP to adjust the power consumption of the Nvidia GeForce Go 7600 and other Nvidia modells.

ACPI is working fine: battery-status is shown and seems to be right, I have to test the durability.

A check with the new version (20060608) of the intel ASL compiler have shown 8 errors and 5 warnings, which i was to handle, but I wasn't able to integrate the fixed dsdt (kernel-panic: mount of root impossible). A Custom dsdt ([WWW] [WWW] http://acpi.sourceforge.net/dsdt/index.php) will be posted soon.

| HDA Intel is used. Six channels are shown:  Headphone (seems to be death), PCM, Front, Line-In, CD and Microfon. All is working fine, but Fn+Up and Fn+Down are only adjusting the Headphone-Channel. How to bind this feature with the PCM- or Front-Channel?
