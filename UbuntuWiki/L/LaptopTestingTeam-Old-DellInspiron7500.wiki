=== Gutsy Issues ===
Need to give acpi=off to GRUB, otherwise LiveCD will hang at "* saving VESA state..."
Or, can pass vga=791 per HardwareSupportMachinesLaptopsDell, but you will get a black screen until X is up all the way, then you need to brush the trackpad to wake it up.
(This was not the case with Dapper/Edgy/Feisty)

==== Notes ====
Uses Mach64-based Mobility P video chip, which has traditionally not had 3D supported in X due to security problems with the DRM module, see bug #34590.  If you intend to get this to work, please make sure the information you have is recent, there have been a lot of changes with DRI respecting this chip.  Also note that the most video memory you can have is 8MB, which limits your resolution and/or screen depth severely if you want 3D with x.org.

With Feisty, the "loading kernel" screen from the LiveCD has screen artifacts/glitches, this was fixed with Gutsy.

With Gutsy, DefaultDepth gets set to 24, but for the 1400x1050 screen there isn't enough video memory, so the resolution that gets set is 1280x860, which makes for a squished screen, and you can't change the color depth with the GUI tool.  A better automatic adjustment would have been to drop the color depth since the LCD can only display 18 bits anyway, or at least not use a wide aspect ratio ("widescreen" is unchecked).  For example, Dapper through Feisty use 1024x768 by default, can change this by editing xorg.conf, don't remember if it can be done with the GUI.
