__TOC__


Lucid Lynx is coming, scheduled for release in April 2010. To celebrate the new release the community is planning release parties which mainly take place in the period of '''29th April - 2nd May'''.

For every Ubuntu release we like to organise parties all over the world. At these parties everyone is welcome and we get together to celebrate, meet new friends and often introduce people new to Ubuntu to our community and our Operating System. Release parties are not only a great way to meet people but they are a lot of fun!
