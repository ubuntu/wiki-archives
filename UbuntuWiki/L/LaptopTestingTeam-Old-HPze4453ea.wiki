'''Solution:'''

Go here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/omke/ and download the '''omke''' package!

Extract it, and move "omke.pl" to the "/etc/init.d"-folder.

Now make a script to execute the file on every bootup:

Edit /etc/init.d/bootmisc.sh, and add the following to the end of the file, before the exit 0:

/etc/init.d/omke.pl -k 1

setkeycodes e070 123

setkeycodes e073 120

setkeycodes e071 116

=== Wireless not working ===

Open the modprobe the blacklist file:

<pre>
/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
</pre>

Insert these lines in the bottom of the file:

<pre>
blacklist prism2
blacklist prism2_pci
blacklist hostap_pci
blacklist hostap
</pre>
