__TOC__

* Contact: AlexRoman
* Make: Toshiba
* Model: M40-JM8

=== Current Issues ===
* loading firewire-related modules (ieee1394, ohci1394, eth1394, sbp2 - I believe that's all, though there could be more) will cause the kernel to disable IRQ #11.
* sk98lin driver conflicts with ipw2200 driver (wireless). When wireless gets activated, the kernel panics - not syncing
* wireless eems to go out after a few minutes (of inactivity?)

==== Solutions ====
===== Networking =====
The way I got my wired ethernet card to work was to download the drivers from SysKonnect themselves and compile them using their ./install.sh script.

* vi /etc/hotplug/blacklist and add these drivers: ieee1394 ohci1394 eth1394 sbp2
* vi /etc/modules and remove sbp2
* Get the driver from http://www.syskonnect.com/syskonnect/support/driver/htm/sk9elin.htm
* Install compiler packages and kernel headers with the command apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-`uname -r`
* `sudo ln -s /usr/src/linux-headers-2.6.10-5-386 /usr/src/linux`
* Go to the directory where you saved the drivers and decompress the archive: `tar -xvjf *.tar.bz2`
* `cd DriverInstall`
* `sudo ./install.sh`
* Configure your network card address/settings any way pleases you
