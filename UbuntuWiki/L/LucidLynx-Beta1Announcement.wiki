The Ubuntu team is pleased to announce the first beta release of Ubuntu
10.04 LTS (Long-Term Support) Desktop, Server, and Netbook editions and of
Ubuntu 10.04 Server for Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud (UEC) and Amazon's EC2.
Codenamed "Lucid Lynx", 10.04 LTS continues Ubuntu's proud tradition of
integrating the latest and greatest open source technologies into a
high-quality, easy-to-use Linux distribution.

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS Desktop and Netbook Editions continue the trend of
ever-faster boot speeds, with improved startup times and a streamlined,
smoother boot experience.

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS Server Edition provides even better integration of the
Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud, with its install-time cloud setup.

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS Server for UEC and EC2 brings the power and stability of
the Ubuntu Server Edition to cloud computing, whether you're using Amazon
EC2 or your own Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud.

The Ubuntu 10.04 family of variants, Kubuntu, Xubuntu, Edubuntu, Ubuntu
Studio, and Mythbuntu, also reach beta status today.

Desktop features
----------------
Social from the start:  We now feature built-in integration with Twitter,
identi.ca, Facebook, and other social networks with the MeMenu in the panel.

New Design: Cleaner and faster boot, new notification area, new themes, new
icons, and new wallpaper bring a dramatically updated look and feel to
Ubuntu.

Ubuntu One: Choose any folder in your home directory to sync, choose from
millions of songs for purchase in the Ubuntu One Music Store. Watch 
http://one.ubuntu.com/blog for the launch of the Ubuntu One Music Store 
public beta.

Please see http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/lucid/beta1 for details.

Server features
---------------

Cloud computing:  The Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud installer has been vastly
improved in order to support alternative installation topologies. UEC
components are now automatically discovered and registered, even with
complex topologies. Finally, UEC is now powered by Eucalyptus 1.6.2
codebase.

UEC and EC2:  Ubuntu 10.04 LTS continues the tradition of official Ubuntu
Server image releases for UEC and for Amazon's EC2, giving you everything
you need for rapid deployment of Ubuntu instances in a cloud computing
environment. UEC images, and information on running Ubuntu 10.04 on EC2, are
available at:

  http://uec-images.ubuntu.com/releases/10.04/beta1

Stability and security:  Ubuntu 10.04 LTS brings many improvements over
Ubuntu 8.04 LTS to keep your servers safe and secure for the next five
years, including AppArmor profiles for many key services, kernel hardening,
and an easy-to-configure firewall.

Ubuntu Netbook features
-----------------------
Ubuntu Netbook Edition is optimised to run on Intel atom based netbooks. It
includes a new consumer-friendly interface that allows users to quickly and
easily get on-line and use their favourite applications. This interface is
optimised for a retail sales environment.

It includes the same faster boot times and improved boot experience as
Ubuntu desktop.

Kubuntu features
----------------

Kubuntu 10.04 LTS will be the first LTS to feature KDE 4 Platform and
Applications.  KDE 4 has come a long way since its early releases and is now
suitable for the high demands of LTS users.  Being an LTS we have focused on
bug fixing and stability for this release, but we did find time to add
features such as touchpad configuration, Firefox KDE integration, Kubuntu
notification improvements, and cross-desktop systray menu standardisation.
Kubuntu features the Plasma Desktop while Kubuntu Netbook Remix comes out of
preview status with the Plasma Netbook workspace.

See https://wiki.kubuntu.org/LucidLynx/Beta1/Kubuntu for more details.

Xubuntu features
----------------

FIXME: waiting for input

Please see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xubuntu/LucidLynx/Beta1 for the
full list and details about all the great enhancements Xubuntu 9.10 
has to offer.

Edubuntu features
-----------------

Edubuntu in Lucid features a more complete live environment containing more
software from universe and all existing language packs as well as our usual
educational software in their current version. For Lucid the text installer
has been removed and so is LTSP for the time being. We expect to have LTSP
back on the DVD for the next beta. The DVD is then much smaller than it used
to be but will still provide a complete education environment based on
Ubuntu Lucid.

Also included on the Edubuntu DVD is a small repository containing the
required packages to transform the regular Edubuntu desktop into a LTSP
server or install the Netbook edition interface.

Ubuntu Studio features
----------------------

FIXME: waiting for input

Mythbuntu features
------------------

Mythbuntu 10.04 introduces MythTV 0.23.  This new version is significantly
faster and should feel more responsive and stable than older versions.  It
also integrates better into the OS with better support for things like
ConsoleKit and Upstart.

Please see http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/Release_Notes_-_0.23 for more details
about changes introduced in 0.23.

See http://mythbuntu.org/10.04/beta for information about the Mythbuntu
beta release.

-----

* On the Desktop: GNOME 2.30, KDE SC 4.4, XFCE 4.6.1, OpenOffice.org 3.2.0,
  X.Org server 1.7.5

* On the Server: Apache 2.2, PostgreSQL 8.4, PHP 5.3.1, LTSP 5.2
