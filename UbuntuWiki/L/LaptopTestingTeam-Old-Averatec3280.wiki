=== Current Issues ===
Installed Kubuntu Gutsy from Alternate-CD since I couldn't boot from Desktop-CD. Installation went smooth, since I had the laptop connected to wired ethernet. Suppose there would have been problems using the build-in wireless (see problem described further down). All upgrades of the system went smooth. Now running Karmic with KDE 3.5.10. Can't log in using KDE 4.3.2 -> Xserver crashes.

==== Notes ====

* X-server didn't start anymore after switching to extend desktop

* * After wakeup external USB devices didn't work anymore. Solved in Karmic.

* ** hardware not available

* *** at random closing the lid doesn't trigger hibernation or shutdown. Have no clue, if that's due to a hardware defect. Solved in Karmic.

* **** build-in  Wifi-card  RT2500 802.11g Cardbus/mini-PCI fails to come up again after suspend to disk. Workaround installing ndiswrapper according to this thread: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=564419
