=== Current Issues ===

None I can blame on Ubuntu;-). The laptop works well for me and is very stable with the breezy kernels. I have not set up the proprietary ATI drivers, so I am lacking the 3D acceleration the laptop offers. Those work, but are too annoying to use on a daily basis with their glitches wrt. powermanagement and virtual console switching.

Current Dapper is hardly useable in day to day business: Trying to shut down the box freezes it and sleep mode does no longer get activated at all (sleep key is just ignored). When running the box is rather stable, but never even think about packing up the laptop and taking it with you:-(

==== Notes ====
* Sleep does work fine
* Hibernate is untested as my swap partition is encrypted and I have not yet found a way to unencrypt it before a resume is started.
* The stability issues I used to have are fixed. Kudos to the ubuntu kernel people.
* Madwifi module works fine now as well.
