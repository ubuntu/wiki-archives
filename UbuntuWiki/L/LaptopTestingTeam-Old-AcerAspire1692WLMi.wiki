'''Note:''' There are different products under this model name.
They vary according to geographical location and possibly date of manufacturing.
This one is a 1690 series DDR2 (1 GiB) with ATI Mobility X700 graphics.
Bought in June 2005. Manufactured in April 2005.

=== Current Issues ===
==== Hoary and Breezy (5.10) ====

Current BIOS version (3a28) is incompatible with Linux ACPI implementation.
Download custom DSDT (http://acpi.sourceforge.net/dsdt/index.php)
to benefit from battery status, etc.

==== Dapper (6.06) LTS ====

Problems with ACPI seem to be gone: boots fine without requiring custom DSDT!  (Using BIOS 3a28.)
X display (with ATI driver) is blank after booting.  See below for easy solutions.

==== Gutsy Gibbon (7.10) ====

The live CD works fine, and the system is completely functional after reboot.
X display works with the free drivers and also with the proprietary (8.37.6 and updates), but no composite effects (graphic card blacklisted, see solution at the bottom of this page).

==== Hardy Heron (8.04) LTS, Intrepid Ibex (8.10) (current stable) ====

The live CD works fine, and the system is completely functional after reboot.
X display works with the free drivers and also with the proprietary, but no composite effects (graphic card blacklisted, see solution at the bottom of this page).

==== Notes ====

===== Dapper Drake (6.06) Release Candidate =====

The LCD display is not detected and configured properly with the 'ATI' driver. This results to screen going black when booting the Dapper RC desktop CD (Bug #39232).

Thus one have to select "Start Ubuntu in safe graphics mode" from the first menu displayed when booting. This will force the use of VESA driver for X desktop. The LCD monitor works with the VESA driver at 1024x768 resolution that is not it's native resolution and seems a little funny.

You may also get the "ATI" driver working properly in native resolution by inserting
<code>Option "MonitorLayout" "LVDS"</code>
in <code>Section "Device"</code> of <code>/etc/X11/xorg.conf</code>.

In order to make the LCD display run at it's native resolution (1280x800) and with 3d acceleration install the official binary driver for 3D ATI graphics cards (xorg-driver-fglrx) and then run sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg from a terminal and select fglrx driver and 1280x800 resolution when prompted. Then run sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart or reboot to load the fglrx driver.

Scrolling buttons under touchpad are not correctly configured by default (Pressing down causes a right click). The problem was solved just after running sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and selecting IMPS/2 for mouse type.

===== Gutsy Gibbon (7.10), Hardy Heron (8.04) and Intrepid Ibex (8.10) (latest stable) =====
'''Composite Desktop'''

The composite effects (compiz-fusion) don't work out of the box for me (tested with the free and proprietary drivers for my ATI mobility X700 graphic card).
The card is blacklisted because it's presenting stability problems with a composite desktop.

To make it work with compiz-fusion (works with the free drivers, not the proprietary for me) go to a terminal and enter this :

<pre>
 echo SKIP_CHECKS=yes > ~/.config/compiz/compiz-manager
</pre>

'''Wifi Button LED'''

To activate the led on the "Wifi Button" go to a terminal
<pre>
 ~$ sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/options
</pre>
and add this lines to the file
<pre>
# Activate the LED on Wifi Button
options ipw2200 led=1 </pre>

===== About the special keys =====
The € and $ keys are duplicates from the classic combination with Alt Gr, but they don't work.

'''Proposition'''

The Acer Special Commands (Fn+F2, Fn+F3, ''P'' key, ''E'' key) can be mapped like this if someone found the key codes.
