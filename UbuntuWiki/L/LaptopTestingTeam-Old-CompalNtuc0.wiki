=== Current Issues ===
Powersaving features do not work reducing the battery time. In particular, it is not possible to adjust screen brightness.

Onboard wired nic does not work out of the box in 9.04 or older. It needs driver installed from backports. Wired nic works out of the box with 9.10 and 10.04 though.
