=== Current Issues ===

==== In Intrepid ====
* Battery status updates very slowly for some reason. About half the time, when the mouse is moved over the battery status icon, nothing shows up. Double-clicking the icon results in nothing happening for awhile, then the battery window pops up some 30 seconds later with the information, and the tooltip is responsive again for a time. This also causes display corruption in the popup window when the AC Adaptor is plugged and unplugged; if the battery status is being unresponsive and the ac is plugged/unplugged, a grey box is shown in the middle lower half of the screen where an icon (for plugged or unplugged) appears. It stays there until the next refresh of the battery status.
