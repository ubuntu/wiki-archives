==== Notes ====
This notebook is very old, slow and you're not going to want to use one.  I have it simply for testing (and practicing scripting/programming).  I have it installed with minimal 'server' settings.  I should probably throw it out but I'm a sucker for hardware and I'm a bit of a pack-rat.
