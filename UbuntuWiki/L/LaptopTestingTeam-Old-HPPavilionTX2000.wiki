I (Pablo) am telling here the process to get the maximum profit of the features of this laptop in Ubuntu. TX2000 is the model sold in Spain. From what I have seen in the forums, it also applies to the other variants: tx2000z, tx2000es, tx2000ed, tx2000ep...
Some variants have another model of some pieces of hardware, i.e. the wireless card, but always Broadcom.

This page is under construction and your collaboration is welcome.

==== Wireless ====
Tx2000 comes with a Broadcom wireless card. If you search in the forums, you will find every kind of workarounds to get it working. People talking about ndiswrapper or b43 module. Those howtos are old. Now it exists a new kernel module called '''wl''' that works better and is easier to install.

Unfortunately, Ubuntu 9.10 seems to have a bug in jockey (the restricted hardware drivers manager) and doesn't detect well the wireless card. So I had to install manually the package to get the broadcom driver:
<pre>
sudo apt-get install bcmwl-kernel-source
</pre>

It's a mess because the installation needs internet to finish, so you need to connect first by ethernet or get the package and then install it from a pendrive.
(This may not be very accurate, I can't remember well. Add more information if you have it ;))

=== Sound ===
Sound works out of the box with Ubuntu 9.10, but there are 2 minor issues I have found:
* When you connect your headphones to any of both audio outputs, you can still hear the speakers.
* Sometimes the key light is yellow even when sound is not muted.

To solve it, you just have to adjust alsa by adding the following line to ''/etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf'':
<pre>
options snd-hda-intel model=hp
</pre>

Reboot is required.

==== UPDATE ====
The truth is that actually (3/Dec/09) there's an issue with the sound driver. I have emailed realtek asking for help to fix it.
If you do the workaround above the microphone will stop working.

=== Notes ===

=== Screen ===
Both pen and touchscreen work out-of-the-box in Ubuntu 10.04. 
Nonetheless, touchscreen configuration needs some kind of adjusting to specify the screen size. For example, you cannot select any corner with your finger.

For previous Ubuntu versions have a look at the project:
* http://linuxwacom.sourceforge.net/

=== Fingerprint ===
You need to install two new packages:
<pre>
sudo apt-get install libfprint0 libpam-fprint
</pre>

You can also install '''fprint-demo''' to test how it works.

Now you can configure every kind of authentication to use fingerprint (that is, sudo, gdm, screensaver). You can find a single file to configure every thing in /etc/pam.d.

For example, if you think it's enough the fingerprint authentication to log in gnome, configure /etc/pam.d/gdm adding this line:
<pre>
...
auth    required        pam_env.so readenv=1 envfile=/etc/default/locale
auth    sufficient      pam_fprint.so
@include common-auth
...
</pre>
