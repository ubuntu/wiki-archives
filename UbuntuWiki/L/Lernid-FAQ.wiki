== Lernid FAQ ==

=== System Requirements ===
Lernid is built for Ubuntu 9.10 Karmic Koala and above. It may be ported to other operating systems in future. It can be installed and run from the Live CD.

==== Network and firewall settings ====
Lernid will require a number of outbound ports to be opened, it will need port 80 for the web chat, presentation slides and browser pages, plus it will need ports 6660-6669 for IRC connections to the freenode.net servers. Most domestic routers will just work without further configuration. If you are on a corporate network and the classroom window on the left has no text in then you will need to get the IRC ports opened up.

==== Proxy settings ====
* needs testing*
probably just respects the system proxy settings
