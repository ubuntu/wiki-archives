=== About Me ===
I am a Computer Science major at the University of North Florida.  I enjoy solving all sorts of problems: from proofs to programming.  My primary language is Java, although I have some C experience, as well.  Additionally, although not fluent, I have done a little programming in Python, PHP and SQL.

What first attracted me to Linux was its price tag.  But once I learned more about the philosophy behind Linux and other organizations, like GNU, I realized that Linux was about freedom and liberty.  I then knew that I wanted to one day contribute to developing free software, hopefully as a career once I graduate but, if that is not feasible, then on the side.

My non-computer-related interests include music, philosophy and my Christianity.
