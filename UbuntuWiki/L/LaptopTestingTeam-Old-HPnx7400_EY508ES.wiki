==== Notes ====

=== Dapper installation notes ===

==== How to fix the "bad state" problem ====

When the Linux is shut down with a psmouse kernel module installed (needed for the touchpad to work) the laptop goes in to the "bad state". The only way to come out from it is to shutdown the laptop and disconnect both the AC adapter and the battery for at least for 5 seconds or so.

Problems in the bad state:
Very slow startup of bios

See http://forums1.itrc.hp.com/service/forums/bizsupport/questionanswer.do?threadId=1026460&admit=-682735245+1154898021917+28353475 for more information.

To work around this add line "/sbin/modprobe -r psmouse" into /etc/init.d/halt and /etc/init.d/reboot scripts (right after the PATH variable setting lines).
