== Name: Larry Chen ==
=== Location: San Jose, CA U.S.A ===

I'm fairly new to Linux and open source in general. Though, I have over 15 years of experience in I/O subsystems, especially, SCSI, Fibre Channel, and SAS and SATA.

This year, I have been learning a lot about embedded Linux development using ELDK 3.1.1 and many other neat development tools. In addition, I just bought a Nokia 770 and plan to hack on it.

Lastly, I am married and have one son who is 2-1/2 year old.
