=== About Me ===

Hey All,

I'm Ashley Wilson, a Web Designer/Developer from Kerala, India. Now a full-time student at USQ Australia, pursuing Masters in IT.

Started using Ubuntu from 5.10 (Breezy Badger) which finally gave me a (comparitively) user-friendly distro to use.

My Launchpad account is <nowiki>[[http://launchpad.net/~lifenstein|here]]</nowiki>
