=== Current Issues ===
* Resolution not correctly detected. Real resolution is 1280x800.
* Touchpad not detected as synaptics, so the scrolling was not enabled.
* dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg could detect both resolution and synaptics touchpad!

==== Feisty Fawn ====
* Resolution not correctly detected. Real resolution is 1280x800. Need to changex xorg.conf
* Touchpad detected as synaptics, so the scrolling was enabled.

==== Notes ====

===== Feisty Fawn =====
All works! I am happy with my Ubuntu.

'''For Russian users'''
Do not upgrade 7.04 -> 7.10. Install clean 7.10 from CD. With upgrade you will have ''problems'' with video and can't login after first reboot. For resolving problem read forums ''before'' install or upgrade.
