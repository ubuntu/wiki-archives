__TOC__

This is just a small tip.
To update the kernel just follow the steps.

 1. Open Synaptics (or do it via apt)
 2. Search for ''linux-image'' packages
 3. Check you processor. If Pentium, get the ''linux-image-686'', if AMD, get ''linux-image-k7''. This will always get the latest kernel image. '''If you have multiple processor, like HT, get ''imagename''-smp '''
 4. Apply changes and boot the pc. You should have the latest kernel for you processor.

Any doubts just edit this page asking for tips os something like that.
