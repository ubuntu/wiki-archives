=== Summary ===

It should be possible to store the persistent "device" (or just /home) on the network so you can resume working from another machine at a later time, using just the live CD.

=== Rationale ===

If the live CD is to be usable as a work platform and not just as a demonstration tool, it should be easy to store the changes on the network somewhere.

=== Use cases ===

* Peter uses the live CD from an internet cafe when he's on vacation.  He accessess his /home as he's used to and has his usual set of settings.

=== Scope ===

=== Design ===

=== Implementation ===
