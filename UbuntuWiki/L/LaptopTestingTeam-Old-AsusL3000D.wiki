__TOC__

* Contact: <nowiki>[[Jeroen van der Vegt]]</nowiki>
* Make: Asus
* Model: L3000D
* Website: http://usa.asus.com/prog/spec.asp?m=L3000-D%20Series&langs=09

Note that this is one of the few AMD laptop models Asus made. Additionally it has a SiS740 video chip, not a Radeo card.

=== Current Issues ===
* 80x25 console does not 'fit' on the screen: the bottom 'fall off' the screen and thus can't be read.  Because of the, bootprogress can't monitored closely. Switching to a higher framebuffer resolution fixes all this.
* ACPI works fine with breezy, but not with Dapper. Therefor, frequency scaling does not work with Dapper. It seems to be a problem with SMP kernels.
* Modem not detected: 
0000:00:02.6 Modem: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] AC'97 Modem Controller (rev a0) (prog-if 00 [Generic])
        Subsystem: ASUSTeK Computer Inc.: Unknown device 1696
        Flags: medium devsel, IRQ 11
        I/O ports at b400 [size=256]
        I/O ports at b000 [size=128]
        Capabilities: [48] Power Management version 2
Used to work (in Debian Unstable) with slmodem driver.

All special keys are handled through ACPI events. An error in the acpi-support packages makes them ALL non-functional (see bug 19671, http://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/show_bug.cgi?id=19671). Applying the patch indicated there makes all important ones work.

Again with indicated patch:
'action keys' (for e-mail, internet etc.) on top work fine.
Multimedia keys on the front work fine (next, previous, play, stop).
Volume knob on the left works fine (same ACPI events as Fn-keys).

Non functional keys: the numeric keypad mapped to normal keys (1,2,3 mapped to j,k,l).
