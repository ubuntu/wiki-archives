== Proposed model for Ubuntu Touch development ==

Please note it's just a draft place where ideas related to a new, better process for release management of touch are invented.

As per the channel spec (Touch/ChannelSchemaSpec) and throughout our existing experience, we can see that Ubuntu Touch development does not fit into the standard desktop release schedule.
