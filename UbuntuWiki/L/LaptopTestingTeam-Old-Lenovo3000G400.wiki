=== Current Issues ===
* Internal speakers do not turn off when headphones are plugged in (see below)
* The fan almost always on. The temperature of CPU is almost at 50C all the time, on full load it can goes to 64C. Because of this, on normal usage at normal environment temperature, the battery power will enough for 2.5 hours, on lower environment temperature it could span into 3 hours.
* Wireless driver needs Restricted Driver (see below)

==== Notes ====

Handling sound leakage when headphone jack is plugged:
* Open Volume Control
* If Front slider is not showed, activate it from Edit > Preferences
* Mute the Front slider while headphone's jack is plugged in.

Setting up wireless driver:
* This notebook is using Broadcom 43xx family
* Install bcm43xx-fwcutter from Synaptic
* Run System > Administration > Restricted Driver Manager
* Click the Checkbox beside "Firmware of Broadcom 43xx chipset family"
* Choose the source of firmware (the option is on a file or downloading from internet)
* For safety reason, restart Ubuntu.
