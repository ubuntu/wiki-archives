=== Current Issues ===
Suspend/Hibernate don't work out of the box.  uswsusp (sudo apt-get install uswsusp) fixed it.  Follow instructions in
http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=471855
Not specific to this hardware, but the DVD drive disappears after kernel 2.6.20-16.  Loading the ide-generic module allows it to be used again, but without DMA.  This seems to be a problem with the kernel in general and not specific to Ubuntu.

==== Notes ====
Used the binary drivers for the NVidia video card (installed using Envy)
Had to change the controlled device for sound to the Surround device to get the hardware control to work.
The webcam is detected and works with Ekiga.

The DVD drive disappears after the 2.6.20-16 kernel, and can be accessed by loading the ide-generic module (modprobe ide-generic, or adding ide-generic to /etc/modules) but this doesn't give DMA which is somewhat problematic.
