==== Notes ====

===== Touchpad =====
The touchpad is a ALPS GlidePoint device and needs to be configured separately to work better than out of the box. I configured my device like described <nowiki>[[http://people.equars.com/~marco/vaio.html|here]]</nowiki>.
The only thing I did differently was to point the 'InputDevice' in /etc/X11/xorg.conf to /dev/input/alps instead of /dev/input/event# because that /dev/input/alps is a symlink to the correct event-device.
I have not yet bothered about 'disabling touchpad while typing' feature. And I probably never will.

===== Graphics =====
A look into /var/log/Xorg.0.log shows a warning about a broken BIOS and the advice to add 
<pre>
Option          "DisplayInfo"   "FALSE"
</pre>
to the Device Section in /etc/X11/xorg.conf and so I did after I experienced occational hangups un shutdown. I cannot yet verify that this solved the problem.
