<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 16:53:38] juju2143, so hey, you ok if we schedule classes to start at #ubuntu-classroom this wednesday?
<juju2143>	[Jun 21 16:53:54] yep
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 16:54:00] I'll talk to them
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 16:54:05] how many weeks do you think you'll need?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 17:02:27] juju2143, ^
<juju2143>	[Jun 21 17:09:21] idk
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 18:09:45] juju2143, sorry for all the annoying :P can you give a quick description of the class? like what you plan on covering? they'll be set up btw, it's all good
<juju2143>	[Jun 21 18:23:48] hm
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 18:44:37] hey bgs100
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 18:44:48] shiiiiiiiit I didn't do my homework
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 18:44:52] *sigh*
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 18:44:58] You have 20 minutes :P
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 18:46:16] yeah brb
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 18:51:32] ok
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 18:51:34] 10 minutes
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 19:07:11] bgs100, I need help with it :/
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:07:43] one sec
<seidos>	[Jun 21 19:11:43] I almost typed ./configure to compile my attempt at hw
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 19:23:41] bgs100, you lie!
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:23:48] No
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 19:23:59] you told me there was no way to check the length of an unknown array
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:24:08] uhhhhh
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:24:25] Not unless you have some value marking the end
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:24:39] pedro3005, What "way" are you talking about?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 19:24:50] I stole this trick from google
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 19:24:53] #define arrayLen(x) (sizeof (x) / sizeof *(x))
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:24:59] ....
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:25:09] ...
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:25:19] That uses sizeof on the array
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:25:25] That != good
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 19:25:26] I see that
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 19:25:35] why?
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:25:44] pedro3005, It may seem to work, but it is not guaranteed and will not work in all cases
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:26:07] The only reason it would work would be because gcc is a smart compiler.
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:26:14] Snova, Ping
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:26:26] Anyway
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:26:32] pedro3005, Okay?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 19:26:41] I guess.. :/
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:26:44] ...
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:26:57] pedro3005, seidos Ready for the class to begin?
<seidos>	[Jun 21 19:27:21] I'm having a problem with the hw
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:27:30] Well
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:27:37] Let's start class and then do homework :p
<seidos>	[Jun 21 19:27:44] I guess I can work on it during class :D
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:27:57] ================== C CLASS OFFICIAL BEGINNINGNESS =====================
<seidos>	[Jun 21 19:28:03] I think I'm close
* bgs100 [Jun 21 19:28:03] frowns at seidos 
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:28:06] Okay
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:28:13] pedro3005, seidos Pastebins from both of you?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 19:28:29] of?
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:28:34] Homework
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 19:28:40] it's not working
* pedro3005 [Jun 21 19:28:42] cries
* bgs100 [Jun 21 19:28:58] throws a kleenex made of aluminum foil at pedro3005 
<seidos>	[Jun 21 19:29:07] mine is close, it's just off by a factor of 2
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:29:09] Pastebin anyway :P
<seidos>	[Jun 21 19:29:13] I think the problem is in the sum
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 19:29:24] I'll just send you what I have
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 19:29:35] bgs100, http://paste.pocoo.org/show/228239/
<Snova>	[Jun 21 19:30:03] bgs100: pong
<seidos>	[Jun 21 19:30:12] bgs100, http://paste.ubuntu.com/453127/
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:30:31] Snova, Explain to pedro why his solution to getting the size of an array is bad please :P
<Snova>	[Jun 21 19:30:54] where?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 19:31:01] #define arrayLen(x) (sizeof (x) / sizeof *(x))
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:31:04] Look up just a bit
<Snova>	[Jun 21 19:31:41] well, it'll work, but only in cases you yourself already know
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:32:23] pedro3005,
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:32:33] Here's why your homework is broken
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:32:43] 	puts("Enter integers:");
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:32:43] 	for (count = 0; ((input = getchar()) != EOF); count++)
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:32:43] 		array[count] = input;
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:33:06] You're assigning each part of "array" to the actual character
<Snova>	[Jun 21 19:33:26] '2' == 50
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 19:33:58] bgs100, damn it...
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:34:00] And newlines
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 19:34:15] array[count] = *input ?
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:34:27] ...
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:34:37] input is not a pointer.
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 19:34:40] well idk, what grabs the value?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 19:34:43] #
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 19:34:48] %
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 19:34:49] something
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:34:50] pedro3005, You *have* a value
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:35:00] That value is a literal character
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 19:35:11] and we need to make it an int?
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:35:19] errr
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:35:28] It is an int
<Snova>	[Jun 21 19:35:42] everything is an int, it just doesn't mean what you think it does
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:35:50] pedro3005, Remember when you asked me how to get a number from a character representing a number?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 19:35:55] yeah, it's the character code
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 19:36:19] I see
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 19:36:37] what's the fix? :p
<Snova>	[Jun 21 19:37:13] there's probably a character-to-integer function somewhere, but the quick way (not necessarily the correct way) would be input-'0'
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:37:31] I would recommend checking if the character represents a number with isdigit(0 from ctype.h and then if so what Snova said
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:37:35] isdigit()*
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 19:37:47] of course it's a number
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 19:37:56] we're asking for numbers >:(
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:38:03] ...
<Snova>	[Jun 21 19:38:04] users suck
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:38:04] Uh
<Snova>	[Jun 21 19:38:11] I just typed "haha" into your program; now what?
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:38:16] Actually
<seidos>	[Jun 21 19:38:17] hey!  I'm a user!
<Snova>	[Jun 21 19:38:34] seidos: yes, and validating your input to make sure you aren't up to something is the bane of all programming
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:38:46] There's still newlines, if you're going to separate the numbers.
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:39:00] Actually, I would just reommend scanf'ing the numbers into your array :p
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:39:04] recommend*
<seidos>	[Jun 21 19:39:09] Snova, the haha module will come out in version .02
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 19:39:14] my program lets you do whatever you want... if what you wish is to break it, then go ahead.. it's not a bug, it's a feature
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:39:19] lol
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:39:46] pedro3005, BTW, "// Sums an array of ints;" is not actually standard C, although most compilers allow it
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 19:40:02] bgs100, why?
<Snova>	[Jun 21 19:40:09] bgs100: // style comments
<Snova>	[Jun 21 19:40:12] er, pedro3005
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 19:40:16] oh
<Snova>	[Jun 21 19:40:23] I'm not sure whether that was accepted into the C standard or not
<Snova>	[Jun 21 19:40:31] in any case it comes from C++
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:40:34] Snova, No, but I think it will be in C99
<seidos>	[Jun 21 19:40:41] are // style comments standard c++?
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:40:42] Or
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:40:45] Fail, not will be
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:40:48] is*
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:40:57] seidos, Mhm
<seidos>	[Jun 21 19:40:57] ah nm, snova answered before I could even type the question
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 19:41:04] bgs100, a problem though, it never stops asking for input
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:41:10] pedro3005, Here:
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 19:41:11] oh
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 19:41:13] wait
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 19:41:15] I can solve it
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 19:41:15] shush
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 19:42:22] damn
<seidos>	[Jun 21 19:42:55] It looks like I fixed the problem with my hw, bgs100, want me to send you my updated code?  or am I too late?
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:42:59] pedro3005, :|
<seidos>	[Jun 21 19:43:02] I'm not sure why it worked though
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:43:06] seidos, Sure, send it
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:43:12] I haven't seen yours yet :P
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 19:43:25] will this damn thing work
* pedro3005 [Jun 21 19:43:29] slaps compiler
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:43:32] pedro3005, Do you want the link to my modification?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 19:43:38] no
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:43:42] ...
<seidos>	[Jun 21 19:44:01] bgs100, http://paste.ubuntu.com/453134/
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 19:44:05] look
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 19:44:08] 	for (count = 0; ((input = getchar()) || count < size); count++)
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 19:44:08] 		array[count] = input-'0';
<seidos>	[Jun 21 19:44:11] it must be the i++, I can't move it to the bottom this time
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:44:36] pedro3005,
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 19:44:50] wait
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 19:44:51] fail
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:45:10] pedro3005, That would probably work for input like "123", but what if I wanted multi-digit numbers? :p
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:45:13] seidos, Good,
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:45:21] seidos, Your problem was,
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:45:52] seidos, That you were trying to access input[10] when it's length is 10 and the first elemnt is at input[0]
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:45:58] element*
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:46:15] So you were going one space too far.
<seidos>	[Jun 21 19:46:20] oh, no, I think it was right
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:46:32] In fact, you still are, in the first part
<seidos>	[Jun 21 19:46:32] hmmm
<seidos>	[Jun 21 19:46:36] wait
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 19:46:37] bgs100, oh, I'll fix it using scanf.. But I don't have much time today.. I'll work on this again later, can we move on to the class? I must leave in ~30 minutes
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:46:37] s/part/loop/
<seidos>	[Jun 21 19:46:38] crap
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:46:52] pedro3005, Can I link you to the modification? :p
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:46:59] Meh
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 19:46:59] ok sure
<seidos>	[Jun 21 19:47:00] it should be adding input[0]...input[10]
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:47:05] pedro3005, http://paste.pocoo.org/show/228243/
<seidos>	[Jun 21 19:47:11] when I added up the inputs manually though, I got 66, not 132
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:47:22] Yeahhhh
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:47:29] seidos, We'll get back to that :p
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 19:47:30] yep, what I thought.. scanf
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:47:33] Onto class
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:47:47] So...
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:47:56] We've learned a bit about arrays...
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 19:48:26] :D
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:48:31] I was thinking we might go on to strings (a special kind of array with functions that apply just to it)
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:48:59] So, yeah
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:49:12] First off: A string is just an array of characters
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:49:29] There is a piece of the standard library dedicated to strings: string.h
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:49:54] Now, with string.h, there's a function called strlen() that gets the length of a string.
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:50:08] How could this work, since a string is an array?!
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 19:50:11] !!!
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 19:50:22] I know!
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:50:22] Because, strings have a special character at the end...
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 19:50:26] damn it
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:50:31] lol
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 19:50:35] NULL? "\0"?
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:50:41] \0 , which is the integer 0 in ASCII
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:50:50] probably everywhere else too :p
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:51:04] pedro3005, yeah, except '\0', not "\0"
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 19:51:17] bgs100, only char arrays end with null?
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:51:26] Not char arrays, strings
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:51:32] There is a tiny distinction
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:51:48] With strings, you do have the \0 at the end
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 19:51:53] char arrays = strings
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:52:08] With char arrays, well, you can have whatever floats your boat (no pun intended)
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:52:29] pedro3005, technically
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:52:32] yes
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:52:49] But you might say that not all char arrays are strings
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 19:52:56] ok
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:52:59] pedro3005,
<Snova>	[Jun 21 19:53:16] ohai
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:53:21] When you take "Hello world" in C, you automatically have a \0 on the end
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:53:33] But you could have a char array that did not
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:53:35] So anyway
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:53:36] hai Snova
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:53:48] So yeah...
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:53:56] seidos, pedro3005 Any questions?
<Snova>	[Jun 21 19:54:07] pedro3005: as arrays do not have a length, so called c-strings are initialized with a \0 at the end in the interests of string handling. only *initialized*; it's your job to maintain it
<seidos>	[Jun 21 19:54:24] no questions here
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:54:32] Okay cools then
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 19:54:53] yeah cool
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:54:57] We've been using strings this whole time in calls to printf, fprintf, puts, and scanf
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:55:06] Being arrays,
<Snova>	[Jun 21 19:55:11] all of which are implicitly assuming there is a \0 at the end
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:55:18] You can access the members of a string and modify them
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:55:48] But, as Snova said, it would probably not be good to replace the \0 without replacing it later
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:56:37] Also, as with arrays,
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:56:47] you can allocate them yourself.
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:57:16] (and realloc them, etc.)
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:58:24] If you want to declare a string (or rather char array/pointer in this case), you just take what you know with int pointers and arrays and swap int for char.
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:58:38] char mychararray[10];
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:58:55] However, you'll want to take care if using a number, because of the extra '\0'.
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:59:03] You can also do things like:
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:59:15] char mychararray[] = "Hallo world";
<seidos>	[Jun 21 19:59:17] bgs100, what do you mean by "using a number"?
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:59:35] seidos, I mean the 10 in "char mychararray[10];"
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:59:40] Sorry for unclear wording
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 19:59:54] If you're declaring an array like that, is what I mean.
<seidos>	[Jun 21 19:59:59] if you don't use a number, what else is there to use?
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:00:05] ...
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:00:10] char mychararray[] = "Hallo world";
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:00:17] pedro3005, Thank you :p
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:00:28] that works?  as like an "infinite" array?
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:00:30] And of course pointers
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:00:33] seidos, Uh no
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:00:53] seidos, The size of the array is just the size "Hallo world" has
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:01:16] but I could do char mychararray[] = "kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk etc etc"
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:01:30] char array[∞];
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:01:31] Um, sure.
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:01:43] pedro3005, Hahaha
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:01:46] Nice
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:02:05] pedro3005, you just solved the "matrix of reality".  We're in an infinite array!
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:02:16] or...not
* bgs100 [Jun 21 20:02:24] gives pedro3005 the Neo badge
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:02:32] haha
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:02:36] :D
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:02:43] pedro3005, Now do some backflips and shootings and stuff in slow-mo :P
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:02:54] bgs100, only in Python
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:02:55] I recommend practicing dodging bullets before actually trying it in real life
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:03:15] seidos, No, just stop them with your hand :p
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:03:22] better yet, teeth
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:03:29] well, practice first
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:03:34] ANYWAY
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:03:41] don't be like those people on LSD that think they can fly...well
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:03:44] yeah...anyway
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:03:52] anyone have a gun I can borrow for practice?
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:03:59] Pshaw, I can fly *begins to levitate*
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:04:14] import antigravity
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:04:15] :p
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:04:17] ANYWAY
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:04:21] C
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:04:21] ANYWAY
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:04:24] D
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:04:34] :p
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:04:37] But seriously
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:04:39] C-C-Combo breaker
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:04:43] So yeah
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:05:01] ...
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:05:08] Any questions?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:05:11] none
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:05:17] seidos ?
* bgs100 [Jun 21 20:05:32] assumes not
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:05:37] ONWARDS
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:05:42] you assume correct
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:06:04] Okay
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:06:17] Really quickly, 3 simple things that I did not mention earlier
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:06:19] First:
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:06:25] The dowhile loop
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:06:29] do {
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:06:33]     stuff
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:06:41] } while (conditions);
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:06:55] It is very much like a while loop,
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:07:08] except the condition is checked after the body has been run
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:07:17] So the body will always execute at least once
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:07:34] Useful for when you have something like:
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:07:37] dostuff
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:07:43] while (condition) {
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:07:49]     dotheexactsamestuff
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:07:51] }
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:08:01] Next
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:08:05] The switch statement
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:08:16] switch (variable) {
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:08:24]     case somevalue:
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:08:28]         dostuff
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:08:34]         break;
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:08:36] }
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:08:41] Okay
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:08:54] The switch statement checks if the variable is equal to a bunch of stuff,
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:09:14] The break meaning it exits the switch and doesn't check for anything else
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:09:29] You can also have stuff like:
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:09:35] switch (variable) {
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:09:44]     case value:
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:09:48]     case othervalue:
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:09:53]         dostuff
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:09:57]         break;
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:09:59] }
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:10:08] do you have to put break;?
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:10:15] In which "dostuff" will execute if variable is value or othervalue
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:10:48] seidos, It makes sense to usually, since your variable probably isn't going to be two values at once.
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:11:04] However, you could have a case that changes the variable for a further case.
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:11:12] why do you put break; in the second case but in the 1st case?
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:11:16] seidos, So, technically not, but usually you will.
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:11:22] seidos, Because,
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:11:30] s/but/but not
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:11:47] We want "dostuff" to execute if the variable is either "value" or "othervalue"
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:12:04] We don't want to break, then.
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:12:14] Also
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:12:24] The equivalent of an "else" in switch is "default:"
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:12:30] switch (variable) {
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:12:37]     case blarg:
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:12:43]         dostuff
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:12:49]         break;
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:12:55]     default:
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:13:03]         dostuff
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:13:10]         break;
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:13:11] }
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:13:12] AND
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:13:23] You do not have to put the break in the default
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:13:29] However
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:13:56] It is generally good practice in case you go back and change the default to a case or add another case or something
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:14:05] (no pun intended)
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:14:15] pedro3005, seidos Questions?
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:14:25] just some thoughts
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:14:29] Yes?
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:14:33] it's interesting that the cases have multiple lines without {}
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:14:39] Yeah
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:14:44] and it's interesting break has a ; but not dostuff
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:14:52] err
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:15:12] seidos, That's just because I assumed you had ;'s in your dostuff :P
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:15:23] dostuff just represents the main body
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:15:29] ah okay
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:15:32] Sorry if that caused confusion
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:15:43] But anyway, about the first thought
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:15:59] That is a good though... it's a depart from the normal syntax
* bgs100 [Jun 21 20:16:11] gives seidos the thinker badge
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:16:22] Okay
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:16:26] Maybe pedro3005 has left...
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:16:29] no
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:16:33] Oh Yay!
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:16:41] Okay then
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:16:46] pedro3005, no questions?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:16:49] none
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:16:52] Okay
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:17:01] I want to see Rodin's statue with the "thinker" badge on it.  that would be tight.
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:17:02] I guess that's why you didn't respond earlier?
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:17:09] seidos, Lol
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:17:34] Okay
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:17:38] Final 3rd thing
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:17:51] The acursed "goto" statement.
* seidos [Jun 21 20:18:01] does the sign of the cross
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:18:09] seidos, Good idea.
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:18:42] The goto statement is often regarded as an evil beast, the god of spaghetti code, and in general acursed.
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:18:55] sounds like I'll love it
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:18:59] seidos, pedro3005 http://xkcd.com/292/
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:19:07] It's the dinosaur one
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:19:10] :P
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:19:12] without looking
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:19:20] yay!
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:19:30] :P
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:19:43] bgs100, where's the badge for knowing xkcd?
* bgs100 [Jun 21 20:19:50] gives that to pedro3005 
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:19:55] Well
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:20:08] I haven't read all of xkcd yet
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:20:12] In all honesty there's a multiple dinosaur ones :P
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:20:23] s/a//
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:20:24] Okay
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:20:30] So
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:20:41] Here's how this demon spawn works:
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:20:51] bgs100, I didn't get the alt-text
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:21:02] pedro3005, Er, uh, google it
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:21:08] alt-text?
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:21:11] This isn't xkcd class :p
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:21:15] oh boy
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:21:18] seidos, However your mouse over the comic
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:21:23] Hover*
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:21:25] Fail
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:21:42] ohhh
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:21:56] seidos, Okay?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:22:00] that ones one obscure joke
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:22:03] was*
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:22:03] yeah
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:22:10] See the text?
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:22:35] ...
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:22:41] yeah I'm looking it up
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:22:44] I mean, I'm only really learning C so I can understand the jokes about C
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:22:50] :P jk
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:22:53] seidos, Hm?
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:22:53] haha
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:23:07] seidos, No, just hover your mouse over the comic
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:23:16] pedro3005, lol :p
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:23:34] bgs100, I hovered over and it said "Neal Stephenson thinks it's cute to name his labels 'dengo'.
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:23:39] Yes
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:23:43] That is alt-text
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:23:44] but it made no sense to me, so I'm looking it up
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:23:47] o
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:23:49] oh*
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:23:51] pedro3005, Well,
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:23:54] That's okay
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:23:56] bgs100, ONTO C
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:24:10] Because all of this C that everyone has taught to you is a lie.
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:24:17] GCC is an elaborate joke
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:24:29] I've been PMing seidos the real lessons
* seidos [Jun 21 20:24:43] checks for a pm from bgs100
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:25:31] maybe irc is an elaborate joke, because I never got any pms...ermmm, I mean, there they are, I just haven't had time to read them
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:25:35] odd, didn't see them before
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:25:40] ...
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:25:52] let's just go on then
* seidos [Jun 21 20:25:54] gives his most convincing smile
* bgs100 [Jun 21 20:26:04] gives seidos the Joke Ruiner badge
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:26:10] (jk :p)
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:26:29] I am "the joke ruiner!"  The Joker's archnemesis
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:26:31] ONWARD
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:26:39] seidos, rofl
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:26:48] The was pretty good xD
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:26:51] That*
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:27:17] ONWARD, huzzah to onward!
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:27:22] and thank you
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:27:28] STUPID KEYBOARD
* bgs100 [Jun 21 20:27:28] burns keyboard
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:27:28] OW CRAP MY HANDS
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:27:28] ONWARD
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:27:29] So
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:27:33] Back to goto
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:27:38] goto goto
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:27:47] So, you make a label like this:
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:27:50] pedro3005, har har :p
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:27:58] Let's say you have your code:
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:28:01] int main() {
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:28:05]     blarg;
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:28:09]     sillystuff;
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:28:19] thisisalabel:
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:28:25]     morestuff;
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:28:28]     return 0;
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:28:29] }
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:28:38] Alright?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:28:44] no {}?
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:28:50] Nooope
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:28:57] how do we determine the end of a label then?
<Snova>	[Jun 21 20:29:02] you don't
<Snova>	[Jun 21 20:29:09] there isn't one
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:29:30] Ohai Snova
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:29:32] >.>
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:29:40] what's the point then?
<Snova>	[Jun 21 20:29:50] ordinarily C code proceeds from statement to statement, making exceptions only when if/while/for denote otherwise. goto allows you to break this rule.
<Snova>	[Jun 21 20:30:07] it simply sets the next statement to be executed to the one after your target albel
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:30:07] Yep
<Snova>	[Jun 21 20:30:13] be it going backwards or forwards
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:30:15] I see
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:30:33] then if you go backwards, it'll execute all the way up to the goto again
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:30:34] Here's how you use goto (assuming you have a label):
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:30:35] right?
<Snova>	[Jun 21 20:30:39] pedro3005: and then what?
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:30:44] goto somelabael;
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:30:52] goto somelabel;*
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:30:54] :p
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:30:54] Snova, infinite loop?
<Snova>	[Jun 21 20:30:57] pedro3005: exactly
* seidos [Jun 21 20:31:39] thinks sentience is an infinite loop
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:31:43] Brb, with an example.
<Snova>	[Jun 21 20:31:44] it's the complete lack of structure therein that is why many languages today don't even have a goto statement; it's considered *very* poor form to use except in certain circumstances
<Snova>	[Jun 21 20:31:56] Linux actually uses it a fair bit, but you'll note it's only to ensure cleanup code gets run
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:32:10] Linux uses it?
* seidos [Jun 21 20:32:25] eyes his computer suspiciously, afraid it might crash at any moment
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:32:37] Lol
<Snova>	[Jun 21 20:32:46] yes, they put some cleanup code at the bottom of a function and "goto it" as a means of simplifying the code
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:32:51] seidos, Quick, cross yourself some more!
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:32:54] :p
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:32:56] seidos, watch out for the dinosaur
<Snova>	[Jun 21 20:33:00] that's about the only reason you'd want to use it, ever
* seidos [Jun 21 20:33:08] says an incantation
<Snova>	[Jun 21 20:33:24] better yet, just don't; if you think you have an opportunity to make good use of it, chances are you don't
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:33:36] ok
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:33:40] pedro3005, does the raptor get you even if you weren't the one who used the goto statement?
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:33:57] aw crap
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:34:17] I just realized I might be attacked by a velociraptor for making this example
<Snova>	[Jun 21 20:34:29] seidos: it's the spaghetti raptor, and you aren't at fault, so probably not
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:34:39] it's okay if you don't compile it
<Snova>	[Jun 21 20:34:48] http://www.u.arizona.edu/~rubinson/copyright_violations/Go_To_Considered_Harmful.html
<Snova>	[Jun 21 20:34:55] lolwut, odd url
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:34:56] Snova, is the spaghetti raptor and the flying spaghetti monster in cahoots?
<Snova>	[Jun 21 20:35:09] seidos: worth investigating
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:35:29] Indeed
* bgs100 [Jun 21 20:35:35] dons detective cap
* bgs100 [Jun 21 20:35:50] dons raptor defense bat

<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:37:00] Prepare to be murdered by raptors
* bgs100 [Jun 21 20:37:17] holds raptor-defense-bat tighter
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:37:46] hold it
* bgs100 [Jun 21 20:37:48] notices his raptor-defense-bat is just a plastic toy nightstick
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:37:58] why am I risking death?  I mean, will I die a noble death?
<Snova>	[Jun 21 20:37:59] I think you need to be more worried about Dijkstra...
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:38:03] seidos, pedro3005 SCRO while keeping lookout
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:38:11] Snova, Lol
* pedro3005 [Jun 21 20:38:20] locks door
* pedro3005 [Jun 21 20:38:23] closes window
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:39:00] ...
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:39:08] Jjst hurry up and tell em the output :p
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:39:10] Just*
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:39:30] i is 1..4
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:39:36] errr
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:39:37] what pedro3005 said
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:39:41] Don't you mean 0...4?
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:39:46] oh yeah
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:39:47] 0-4
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:39:54] *rolls eyes*
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:39:55] yeah, 0, 1, all the same
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:40:03] uhhh
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:40:09] shush
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:40:10] *Universe Asplodes*
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:40:11] on with the C
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:40:13] 0 = 1, that's Zen
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:40:32] seidos, No, I think that's just fail :p
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:40:38] ANYWAY
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:40:41] VERILY ONWARD
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:40:50] So basically, this code is equivalent to a for loop
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:40:53] yes, kind sir
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:40:59] for (i = 0; i < 5; i++)
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:41:08]     printf("i is %d\n", i);
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:41:30] That's what this is doing
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:41:54] I see
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:41:58] Interestingly, you can also have a label after a goto.
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:42:01] Like so:
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:42:04] int main() {
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:42:20]     if (idontwanttorunsomecode)
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:42:30]         goto tthheeefffuuuttuuureee;
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:42:34]     somecode;
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:42:38]     somemorecode;
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:42:49] tthheeefffuuuttuuureee:
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:43:06]     puts("WHHHOOOAAAA We're in the fffuuutttuurreee");
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:43:09]     return 0;
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:43:10] }
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:43:20] Okay?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:43:23] makes sense
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:43:27] Good
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:43:28] seidos ?
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:43:50] yeah, clear as mud
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:43:51] as usual
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:43:58] ...
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:44:03] seidos, You have questions?
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:44:33] I guess it makes sense
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:44:39] just had to find which one was the label
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:44:47] Snova, why that link you sent as in a folder called copyright_violations on a directory of University of Arizona's department of sociology is beyond me
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:44:52] was*
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:45:03] seidos, there was only one label :p
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:45:09] And it was not indented
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:45:25] yeah tthheeefffuuuttuuureee: is the label
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:45:29] mhm
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:45:45] Snova, Ping
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:45:59] so tthheeefffuuuttuuureee;
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:45:59] <bgs100>     somecode;
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:45:59] <bgs100>     somemorecode;
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:46:04] is skipped, right?
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:46:09] Yes!
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:46:11] Good
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:46:15] also, at a picture of a kid flipping the camera off is present in the directory
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:46:18] a*
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:46:27] pedro3005, lolwat
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:46:35] bgs100, indeed
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:46:41] verily
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:46:47] I'm going to study sociology at Arizona now
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:46:53] xD
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:46:55] I wonder what kind of crazy shit they smoke
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:47:02] so.
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:47:06] moving on.
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:47:14] young claude.  ha
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:47:29] Now, pedro3005, seidos, you know most of C The Language.
* pedro3005 [Jun 21 20:47:44] celebrates
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:47:49] bgs100, then why can't I speak c?
* pedro3005 [Jun 21 20:47:59] goes to program a new operating system
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:48:01] Hmm
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:48:23] maybe it's because I don't understand Dijkstra
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:48:35] Wait
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:48:37] does that mean that all that's left are projects using C to solve problems?
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:48:42] Were you joking, or what?
* pedro3005 [Jun 21 20:49:01] grabs C book
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:49:05] Hey, I'm going to have to go for a few minutes soon.
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:49:07] there must be something here we don't know
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:49:15] pedro3005, Wait :p
* seidos [Jun 21 20:49:25] thinks of something
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:49:27] bgs100, assign homework and dismiss class then
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:49:38] well specific functions that exist in the many include files
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:49:44] No, I don't have time
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:49:59] okay... farewell
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:50:07] I guess I can work on problem 2 of projecteuler
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:50:07] You know about data types, functions, pointers, and a lot of other stuff
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:50:22] And some of the standard library
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:50:28] We will cover more of that later
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:50:28] thank you bgs100
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:50:30] bbs
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:50:35] Clas isn't over :p
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:50:38] Class*
<mohi1>	[Jun 21 20:50:42] :o
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:50:54] class is perpetual
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:50:57] Lol
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:50:58] but just because you're in class
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:51:01] doesn't mean you have class
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:51:01] Bye
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:51:04] bye
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:51:05] Be back in a few
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:51:10] I won't
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 20:51:14] seidos, That was zen-ish :p
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:51:21] bye until tomorrow
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:51:30] well, i'll hang out until 22
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:51:47] already procrastinated the fuck out of studying for a test anyway
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:52:29] what test?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:52:36] history / sociology
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:53:27] ah
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:53:45] whoa
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:53:49] this is weird
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:53:55] I think I'm actually disappointed class is over
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:54:01] mohi2911, put the logs online
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:54:02] I don't think that's ever happened before
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:54:20] seidos, hey, do you know this book? http://www.amazon.com/Sophies-World-History-Philosophy-Classics/dp/0374530718/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1277167733&sr=8-1
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:54:57] never heard of it
<Snova>	[Jun 21 20:55:15] bgs100: pong
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:55:50] seidos, I was reading some of it at the library today
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:55:52] interesting things
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:55:56] pedro3005, do you know this book:  http://www.amazon.com/Cartoon-History-Universe-Vol-Pt-1/dp/0385265204/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1277167914&sr=8-1
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:56:01] I read about Hume and remembered of that buddhism thing you said
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:56:04] the doctrine of no-self
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:56:08] Hume did have that
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:56:20] Hume believed in no-self?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:56:40] yes
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:57:18] To Hume, the self is constantly bombarded by events and changes, and it does not have an immutable always-present essence, but changes itself fundamentally over time
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:57:40] so there is no essential immutable notion of self to Hume
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:58:08] a self that changes doesn't necessarily mean a self that isn't
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:58:38] depends on your concept of self, I guess
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:58:41] the Buddhist stuff is pretty dense.  The monk that I talk to on facebook just linked me a bunch of stuff to read when I questioned his beliefs
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:59:17] seidos, it is definitely an interesting book, although it's a little too simple and detached
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:59:33] I don't know what the self is, it certainly appears to be intimately dependent on the brain
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:59:42] my question is "how did I get here?"
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 20:59:54] your mom and dad conceived you
<seidos>	[Jun 21 20:59:57] I didn't ask to be born.  My nightmare is that I'll be born again, just like I was born this time
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:00:16] After studying religion my hope has started to become that death is the end
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:00:39] nobody asks to be born, because life exists randomly, and not on a purpose... As Sartre would put it, "existence precedes essence"
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:00:52] that's what I say... I hope this is it
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:01:04] but the only way I can be certain that I won't get born again, is if I can maintain awareness.  Problem is, awareness goes away at death
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:01:08] the infinite is sickening
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:01:26] some guy in #jesus was telling me "eternity is awesome"
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:01:29] you cannot be certain
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:01:35] I asked him if "hell was awesome"
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:01:38] he said no.
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:02:01] but they never actually acknowledge their mistaken views
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:02:19] the problem with randomness, is cause and effect
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:02:24] I think eternity of the self is despairing
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:02:29] look
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:02:43] an eternity free from suffering is by definition not despairing
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:02:49] let's first assume heaven is constant and immutable
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:03:35] Your presence of heaven over time would obviously diminish your happiness as time passes
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:03:43] to this problem, there are two solutions:
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:03:54] 1. there is no notion of time in heaven
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:04:35] this is a problem in itself, because self-consciousness only exists within time.. "the self is nothing but its act of synthesis sublime. this act must be the same to be self-conscious over time" (remember Kant?)
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:04:40] it follows then that:
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:04:46] 2. heaven must be changing
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:05:36] being infinite the time spent at heaven and arguably finite the number of possible states, heaven must at some point run out
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:05:43] following that
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:06:01] actually, heaven changing is consistent with scripture
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:06:18] Adam and Eve were perfect before they fell, implying a "heaven like perfect state"
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:06:38] and the mainstream xian belief of satan's fall, with 1/3 of the angels, also implies heaven is not immutable
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:06:39] but the movement of heaven is absurd
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:06:45] for heaven is perfect, and there can only be one perfect
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:07:03] I disagree that there is not notion of time in heaven
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:07:10] if there is motion, there is a notion of time
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:07:15] me too
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:07:37] but if there is motion, there is a change of state, say state A and B
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:07:38] it kind of makes me wonder, "If you can imagine it, does that mean that it exists"?
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:07:59] s/not/no
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:08:17] the idea of heaven is absolutely perfect
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:08:27] maybe the flying spaghetti monster is floating around the planet out in this very Universe
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:08:32] this follows that A and B are both absolutely perfect and thus alike
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:08:39] and if not this one...oh right, sorry I'm digressing
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:08:54] so the notion of change is incompatible with the notion of perfect
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:09:09] ah, I see your question
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:09:25] is it possible for two systems, A and B, both to be perfect, and different?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:09:42] heaven cannot exist
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:10:02] perhaps there is only one perfect "system" A, that has subworlds A1, A2, A3 ... Ainfinite
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:10:11] I don't have the infinity symbol
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:10:11] if it's immutable, there is no self; if it is mutating, it is not perfect, therefore not heaven
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:10:35] hey, I kind of liked this argument of mine
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:10:46] I don't understand your logic
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:10:55] what do you mean by "it's"?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:11:02] heaven
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:11:05] just take out the "its" and put in the noun
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:11:12] if heaven is immutable, blabla
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:11:28] if heaven is immutable, there is no self, if heaven is mutating, heaven is not perfect, therefore not heaven
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:11:39] I don't get what heaven has to do with self
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:11:55] if something is immutable, there cannot be a notion of time
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:12:05] the notion of self only exists within time
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:12:31] I dunno
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:12:37] I'm not ready to accept it
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:12:53] that the notion of self can only exist with time?
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:12:59] this reminds me of when I asked in #jesus if I got tired of being in heaven if I could just kill myself
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:13:04] religion is absurd though
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:13:13] that's what I want to show
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:13:16] oh, right
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:13:37] but this derives the old darned question of "where does the notion of self come from?"
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:13:47] I think "if something is immutable, there cannot be a notion of time" is an a priori statement, that may or may not be true
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:14:00] I depends how immutable
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:14:06] s/I/it
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:14:19] of course.. the mere passing of time is already a mutation
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:14:24] suppose you bring your clock to heaven
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:14:28] it will change
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:14:43] in Buddhist cosmology, even heavenly beings die
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:14:49] the absurd is in implying here that there is a notion of "perfect" within a watch
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:15:23] now play devil's advocate
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:15:30] I don't know
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:15:36] I don't think it's ironclad
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:15:46] it all depends on the premise that something immutable can't have time
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:15:50] what about something eternal?
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:15:54] hmmm
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:16:04] eternal is not necessarily defined as heaven
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:16:25] actually the definition of heaven in the bible doesn't say there won't be any suffering
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:16:29] 'eternal' is an idea with no known real correspondent
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:16:31] it implies it
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:16:36] but doesn't say it explicitly
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:16:43] in revelation it says there won't be any night
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:16:49] and no that God will wipe people's tears
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:16:50] hey
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:16:56] yeah
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:16:57] maybe we should make this argument in #jesus
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:17:06] you will be disappointed
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:17:12] why?
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:17:33] it just will get crazy with their apologetics
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:17:42] but I'd like to see you try, it is a noble effort
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:17:45] For truth!
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:17:51] hey, I know who I can argue this with
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:18:09] damn it
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:18:11] he's not here
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:18:23] I can present it in #jesus if you don't do it
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:18:43] heck, I'll do it
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:18:43] but I don't believe in it as much as you do, so may not do the presentation justice
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:18:54] s/may/my
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:19:23] pedro3005, you could also try presenting the argument in #philosophy
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:27:07] BAAAACKKKKK
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:27:54] CLASS DOTH NOT BE OVER!
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:27:57] wb bgs100
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:27:58] VERILY!
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:28:15] "<seidos> I think I'm actually disappointed class is over" aww :D
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:28:57] Hmm
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:29:13] pedro3005 and seidos, you two should start a philosophy class
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:29:23] like anyone would come
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:29:24] :P
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:30:13] we could just talk in #philosophy
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:30:24] same diff as a class, sorta' kinda'
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:30:56] I would come
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:31:12] :p
<Snova>	[Jun 21 21:31:24] "bgs100 teaches C and pedro3005 and seidos discuss philosophy related to C daily at 23:00 UTC"
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:31:45] related to C?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:31:49] not really
<Snova>	[Jun 21 21:31:49] well, sometimes
<Snova>	[Jun 21 21:31:55] it seems to start there
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:32:02] well, I guess there's no goto in heaven
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:32:39] lol
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:32:43] no goto in heaven
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:32:45] damn it
* Snova [Jun 21 21:32:49] goes back to not being here
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:32:57] I need an objective perfect to disprove heaven
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:33:00] >:(
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:33:06] no raptors either
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:33:20] bgs100, continue, then?
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:33:32] bgs100, goto continue:?
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:33:56] how did the conversation on heaven relate to C anyway?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:33:56] goto class
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:34:06] ha
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:34:09] I still don't really get classes
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:34:14] recursive functions are also a trip
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:34:19] seidos, it didn't, I abruptly changed it to Hume
<Snova>	[Jun 21 21:34:29] recursion is easy; making it stop is somewhat harder :p
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:35:38] Wait
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:35:42] Almost done reading logs
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:35:49] hmmm, I wouldn't say it's easy.  I'll have to review code presented in class to attempt construction a recursive f(x)
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:36:16] This amused me: "<seidos> this reminds me of when I asked in #jesus if I got tired of being in heaven if I could just kill myself"
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:36:22] :p
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:36:34] sadly, they said yes
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:36:40] ...
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:37:06] I have the log, maybe I'll go back and reread my conversations in there for kicks
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:37:12] or...not
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:37:25] xD
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:37:57] Well
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:38:05] We've covered most of the actual language
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:38:18] We're going to continue with more of the standrad library
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:38:45] standard*
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:38:47] >:P
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:39:02] I'm with ya'
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:39:04] I think I've been punished for using goto via my keyboard
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:40:09] hmm
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:40:21] pedro3005, seidos What are you impressions of C and this class?
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:41:26] oh sure, so talkative 8 minutes ago :p
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:42:08] well, some thoughts off the top of my head.  I really didn't think I could even get the basic ideas of C, but after the classes, and the hw, it looks like I actually was able to piece together some *very* basic programs
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:42:35] which has left me feeling more confident to tackle more challenging problems
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:42:46] :D
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:42:55] I still don't get the result in one of my hw assignments though, even after beating my head against over and over
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:42:58] Well that's good :)
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:43:08] s/against/against it
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:43:10] seidos, Okay, which assignment?
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:43:20] the array assignment
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:43:25] where we were supposed to sum
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:43:45] I extrapolated out the summation (at least I think), but I got a totally different answer
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:43:54] Okay, can you re-link to the pastebins?
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:44:12] if I drop the i's top value, it turns out to be the right answer when I do it manually on a calculator
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:44:14] yeah
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:44:43] Also
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:44:45] http://paste.ubuntu.com/453127/
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:44:54] okay
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:45:04] seidos, Here is the problem
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:45:12] int input[10];
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:45:18] I don't feel safe with structs
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:45:22] You declare input to have a length of 10
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:45:25] I don't think I can use them quite well
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:45:28] pedro3005, Okay, one sec
<Snova>	[Jun 21 21:45:31] looping from 0 to 10 inclusive will iterate ELEVEN times
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:45:38] Yeah
<Snova>	[Jun 21 21:45:40] your loop conditions should be < 10
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:45:47] seidos, And thus you try to access input[10]
<Snova>	[Jun 21 21:45:58] remember in an array of length 10, the indexes are 0-9 inclusive
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:46:04] When your elemtns only go from input[0] to input[9]
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:46:13] elements*
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:46:31] but shouldn't both loops have the same number of iterations?
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:46:36] seidos, Yes
<Snova>	[Jun 21 21:46:47] yes. and they should be running 10 times each, but they're running 11 iterations
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:47:00] So replace "i<11" with "i<10" in both of them
<Snova>	[Jun 21 21:47:02] which is, at the least, one problem
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:47:21] ah
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:47:34] Besides that it looks fine
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:47:37] wait, I still don't get
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:47:38] it
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:47:51] What don't you get?
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:47:55] but you're saying if I change both loops to i<10 then it will work?
<Snova>	[Jun 21 21:48:06] maybe, maybe not, but it's a bug nonetheless
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:48:09] I take in 11 inputs
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:48:15] then it adds 11 times
<Snova>	[Jun 21 21:48:21] but your array only has 10 elements
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:48:22] it should come out to the right value
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:48:22] Yes, because that way you won't be trying to access input[10]
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:48:29] ohhhhh
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:48:30] crap
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:48:33] :P
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:48:43] so it's 0 to 9
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:48:44] dang it
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:48:51] Yes
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:48:57] seidos, Get it now?
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:49:19] I won't believe until it's compiled and shows the right answer :P
<Snova>	[Jun 21 21:49:30] seidos: also, something worth mentioning is there is a shorthand for "sum = sum + input[i];", the += operator. "sum += input[i]" is equivalent, and there are many other compound operators like this (+=, -=, *=, /=, etc.)
<Snova>	[Jun 21 21:49:57] I don't think it will change the fact that it's wrong, unless you're trashing the stack somehow...
<Snova>	[Jun 21 21:50:09] but there's no obvious problems; it's a simple sum
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:50:20] Compiled the fix and it works
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:50:25] I never would've found that problem
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:50:40] I was looking in the loops for the problem when it was in my array declaration :(
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:50:45] Er
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:50:52] well, I guess it could have been the loops if I reduced both of them to 10
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:50:56] I would say it was a problem with your loops :p
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:51:02] but that didn't make sense without knowing why
<Snova>	[Jun 21 21:51:09] bgs100: only if 10 is necessarily better than 11 somehow :p
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:51:11] Well, now ya know why
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:51:21] Snova, Pshaw, of course it is
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:51:25] Well
<Snova>	[Jun 21 21:51:29] not in base 11!
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:51:33] Except for 11 being a number-palindrome
<Snova>	[Jun 21 21:51:38] and it's prime
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:51:41] Mm
<Snova>	[Jun 21 21:51:45] hmmmmm
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:51:45] Good point
<Snova>	[Jun 21 21:51:51] number systems based on prime numbers
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:52:01] And there's a multiple of it in "1337"
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:52:17] Yeah, 11 is pretty awesome
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:52:35] Oh, and we're up to the 11th Doctor :p
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:52:38] the += operator is a trip
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:52:56] lol
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:52:59] Snova, Your arguments have changed my mind!
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:53:00] it's easy
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:53:03] 11 pwns 10
<Snova>	[Jun 21 21:53:05] bgs100: :|
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:53:06] x = x + y
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:53:09] x += y
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:53:12] Snova, What? :p
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:53:25] there's a variable in that +=
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:53:29] that's weird
<Snova>	[Jun 21 21:53:34] bgs100: nothing. there should be a number system based on primes though, instead of the arbitrary "ten"
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:53:35] :D
<pedro3005>	[Jun 21 21:53:51] Good night.
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:53:55] a number system based on primes?
<Snova>	[Jun 21 21:53:56] g'night
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:53:57] Night pedro3005
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:53:58] night pedro3005
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:54:06] ah
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:54:08] 2 is prime
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:54:09] Snova, Ten isn't arbitary! It's ten in base ten!
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:54:14] :P
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:54:38] so base 2 is a number system based on a prime number
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:54:44] Whatever base 10 may happen to be
<Snova>	[Jun 21 21:55:03] not quite what I meant... I don't really know what I mean
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:55:08] Lol
<Snova>	[Jun 21 21:55:13] they wouldn't be primes anymore
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:55:19] 0_0
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:55:33] wwhhoooaaaa
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:56:36] Actually
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:56:47] Why wouldn't they be?
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 21:56:54] <mathclass>
<Snova>	[Jun 21 21:57:35] because as soon as you count to four in your prime-based number system, you meet a number that isn't prime
<Snova>	[Jun 21 21:57:39] </mathclass>
<seidos>	[Jun 21 21:59:16] does that mean the primes are different based on the base?
* seidos [Jun 21 21:59:45] shakes head
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 22:00:11] :/
<Snova>	[Jun 21 22:00:22] I was thinking of counting in primes
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 22:00:23] Oh
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 22:00:27] I misunderstood
<Snova>	[Jun 21 22:00:31] instead of 1,2,3,4,5 we'd go 2,3,5,7,11
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 22:00:43] Ah...
<Snova>	[Jun 21 22:00:45] except those numbers are only primes in base ten
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 22:00:50] Yeah
<Snova>	[Jun 21 22:00:52] 7 would be 4, and not prime
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 22:00:52] Also
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 22:00:56] FRREEE UNNIICOODEEE
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 22:00:59] Ð† wÑ–Î·, â…¿Ï…Ð°ÒºÐ°ÒºÐ°ÒºÐ°. ÐœÐ¾Ð°r ÑÐ¾â…¼Ö…rÑ•!
<Snova>	[Jun 21 22:01:01] also, I have no idea what the heck it would be useful for
<seidos>	[Jun 21 22:01:13] so it would be different, but not really
<seidos>	[Jun 21 22:01:26] I mean 7 is still 7, even if it's represented as a different number in a different base
<Snova>	[Jun 21 22:02:13] yes, but the fourth number in any number system is divisible by the second number
<Snova>	[Jun 21 22:02:17] 3 * 3 = 7
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 22:03:03] & * & = (((
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 22:03:05] :p
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 22:03:18] Hmm
* bgs100 [Jun 21 22:03:39] imagines a number system where O + M + G = 0_0
* seidos [Jun 21 22:03:46] tries to count in binary
<seidos>	[Jun 21 22:03:56] I have to convert it to count
<Snova>	[Jun 21 22:03:58] 1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111
<Snova>	[Jun 21 22:04:03] not hard
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 22:04:20] Just carrying some numbers every other time :P
<seidos>	[Jun 21 22:04:24] so 0100 is divisible by 0010
<seidos>	[Jun 21 22:04:29] crap, I almost said visible
<Snova>	[Jun 21 22:04:30] yes, lots and lots of carrying
<seidos>	[Jun 21 22:04:32] hmmm that works
<Snova>	[Jun 21 22:04:36] and I can't do anything in it except count :p
<Snova>	[Jun 21 22:04:53] well, I can see that, since if only one bit is set it's a power of two
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 22:05:36] 111 + 10 = 1001
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 22:05:40] I think? :p
<seidos>	[Jun 21 22:05:52] I don't know how to add in binary without converting
<Snova>	[Jun 21 22:05:59] hrm
<seidos>	[Jun 21 22:06:04] to base 10...well, or using a calculator
<Snova>	[Jun 21 22:06:07] 1101?
<Snova>	[Jun 21 22:06:18] no, bgs was right
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 22:06:21] Yeah
<Snova>	[Jun 21 22:06:27] I could probably do it on paper
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 22:06:31]  yes
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 22:06:33] Like:
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 22:06:37]  111
<seidos>	[Jun 21 22:06:39] ah, carrying
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 22:06:40]  010
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 22:06:42] +
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 22:06:45]  ___
<seidos>	[Jun 21 22:06:56] 1001
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 22:07:10] right
<seidos>	[Jun 21 22:07:15] makes sense
<seidos>	[Jun 21 22:07:21] now how do you multiply?
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 22:07:22] mhm
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 22:07:26] ...
<seidos>	[Jun 21 22:07:32] 111
<seidos>	[Jun 21 22:07:33] *
<seidos>	[Jun 21 22:07:35] 010
<seidos>	[Jun 21 22:07:37] ____
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 22:07:58] 1110?
<seidos>	[Jun 21 22:08:12] I dunno, I just keep anding it basically
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 22:08:20] Let's convert and see if I'm right
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 22:08:31] 7 * 2
<seidos>	[Jun 21 22:08:34] yeah
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 22:08:40] 14
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 22:08:41] Yes
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 22:08:44] I am right :D
<seidos>	[Jun 21 22:08:44] I used the binary calculator in gnome
* bgs100 [Jun 21 22:08:58] does a little dance
<seidos>	[Jun 21 22:09:10] how'd you do it?
<seidos>	[Jun 21 22:09:14] what is 1 * 0 if not 0?
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 22:09:14] Well
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 22:09:18] seidos,
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 22:09:24] 0 * 111 = 0
<seidos>	[Jun 21 22:09:41] ah
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 22:09:42] 1 (in the next place) * 111 = 111 (one place up)
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 22:09:45] which is 1110
<seidos>	[Jun 21 22:09:49] ah distributing it
<seidos>	[Jun 21 22:09:52] forgot to do that
<seidos>	[Jun 21 22:09:53] and add
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 22:09:56] It was literally 10 * 1111
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 22:10:01] er
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 22:10:03] 111*
<Snova>	[Jun 21 22:10:08] now do 100/10
<Snova>	[Jun 21 22:10:18] never mind
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 22:10:21] 10
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 22:10:32] amiright? :p
<Snova>	[Jun 21 22:10:43] annoyingly enough you're right in both base 2 and base 10 :p
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 22:10:51] :D
* bgs100 [Jun 21 22:11:07] declares himself binary expert! :p
<seidos>	[Jun 21 22:11:26] still don't get the division
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 22:11:31] Well
<seidos>	[Jun 21 22:11:35] can't do it on paper, get the * though
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 22:11:40] Do it like in decimal
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 22:11:56]   ___
<seidos>	[Jun 21 22:12:04] ha!
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 22:12:05] 10|100
<Snova>	[Jun 21 22:12:11] 6 + 6 = C
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 22:12:20] 10 goes into 1 zero times
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 22:12:28] 10 goes into 10 1 tim
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 22:12:32] time*
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 22:12:38] 10 goes into the next 0 0 times
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 22:12:40] thus 010
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 22:13:01] Snova, :p
<seidos>	[Jun 21 22:13:22] 10000000/10 = 100000
<seidos>	[Jun 21 22:13:46] I'm doing it on paper to help me visualize it
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 22:13:51] I remember for you fathers day I got some hexadecimal numbers and got my Dad to add them. The answer was DAD
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 22:13:57] s/you/one/
<Snova>	[Jun 21 22:14:14] heh
<Snova>	[Jun 21 22:14:40] geek seems to run in the family
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 22:14:42] This year I made him decode some various ciphertext :p
<Snova>	[Jun 21 22:14:49] hahaha
<seidos>	[Jun 21 22:15:17] I just sent my Dad an email
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 22:15:28] Although I basically had to spell out for him how to use the Vignere cipher even though I had told him before :p
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 22:15:56] The key was the answer to some other ciphertext :p
<Snova>	[Jun 21 22:16:02] haha
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 22:17:02] Snova, But yeah. My Dad is very much into math.
<seidos>	[Jun 21 22:17:59] my Dad isnt really into math
<seidos>	[Jun 21 22:18:10] the only person really into math are my brother and I
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 22:18:16] Ah
<seidos>	[Jun 21 22:18:34] my brother specialized in AutoCAD, and makes a living at it
<seidos>	[Jun 21 22:18:59] I have no specialty
<bgs100>	[Jun 21 22:20:50] Sometimes my dad drags me over to him and attempts to teach me some math, and occasionally I try to teach him some Python/C/Common Lisp/Shell/Various other stuff :p
<seidos>	[Jun 21 22:21:41] my Dad has tried to teach me anthropology, I think
<seidos>	[Jun 21 22:22:02] trying to remember the stuff he's talked about
<seidos>	[Jun 21 22:23:09] he did a study on left vs right handedness
<seidos>	[Jun 21 22:23:16] not sure what the hypothesis was
<seidos>	[Jun 21 22:24:03] I should call him and ask someday
