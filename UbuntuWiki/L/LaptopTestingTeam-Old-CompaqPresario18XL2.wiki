==== Notes ====
* [1] The hardware volume controls increases and decreases the volume. But it does not move the volume bar when the audio controls are open. The hardware volume does not show any changes to the volume. Also there are no hardware mute keys on this laptop.
** Similar to the ThinkPads, there's a hardware mixer that is separate from the software ALSA mixer which is what appears in the volume control panel.  The mute-status seems the only thing that it's worth-while trying to synchronise;  what's the default suppiled behaviour in MS Windows, it would seems sensible to match that.  Does the hardware volume in Windows put up any status or indication that the keys have been pressed? -PaulSladen
* [2] There is a small blue toggle between the left and right mouse buttons that also acts as a mouse wheel. This toggle button works correctly as a mouse wheel.
* [3] After the system comes out of hibernation, the system may have video distrotion. If the lid is set to suspend when closed, it will wake up when opened.
