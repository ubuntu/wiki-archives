__TOC__

* Contact: ChrisWilson
* Make: IBM Thinkpad T43
* Model: 266875U
* see also LaptopTestingTeam/ThinkpadT43

* '''''UPDATED: 8-Oct-2005'''''

=== Main Differences to ThinkPadT43 ===

* Atheros wireless card
* ATI Mobility Radeon X300 with 64MB
* DVD±RW
* 1400x1050 screen resolution

=== Current Issues ===

* Atheros card not connecting at install time ''(am able to enable it once booted)''
* Fan ALWAYS on (same with Win XP, I think)
* Hard drive recognized as SCSI device (sda) (seems to be sonoma thing.)
* Random Hard Freezes (no log info) -- seems ''FIXED''
* No 3D hardware acceleration
* Resume from hibernate says I need to seet "resume= " kernel option
* Hard Drive shock protection not working ''(Seems like Robert Love is working on that)''
* Fingerprint Reader not working
* Combination middle button (the blue one) and pointer should scroll screen. ''Currently only used as middle mouse button. It's a trade off between unix style cut and paste or scroll. For me scroll wins and it's the default on factory installs''
