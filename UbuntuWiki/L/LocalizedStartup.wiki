There are no longer boot messages, the whole boot process is graphical. I believe this page can be removed, I might even do it myself if no-one else does, but how do we remove the Blueprint? DuncanLithgow (Jan 10, 2008)

=== Summary ===

System boot up messages should be localized.

=== Rationale ===

Many desktops/laptop systems use only one language, that language could be used to show boot up messages.

=== Use cases ===

Jane has put Ubuntu on her mother's new PC. Mom does not speak english at all. 

=== Scope ===

=== Design ===

=== Implementation ===

Suggestion: only utf8, one .mo file, gettext with special binary gettext-simple that does not look at anything else than /boot/messages.mo (for example). Efficient and small.
