=== Current Issues ===
Heat issues when idle, seems the slowing of clock speed stops the automatic fans, causing the system to get hot. This may or may not apply to all of the TravelMate 4060 series and may or may not damage the system after long periods of time, testing is incomplete.

==== Notes ====
I have confirmed all of the above except that native resolution was not working correctly on install, but I beleive an update has fixed that and will test out the newest Dapper Flight at next chance. On first install, the battery was detected, but if power was removed, Ubuntu started to shutdown. This was fixed after an update and is probably fixed in the latest Flight.
