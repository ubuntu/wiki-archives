=== Goals ===

=== Use cases ===

*** Loubna goes to a computer fair. She might have heard of Open''''''Office.org, Firefox and maybe Linux, but probably not of Ubuntu. She passes by our stand. A booth volunteer tries to get her interested in Ubuntu and in the regional LoCo team.

*** Piotr wants to stay informed of Ubuntu news: new releases, local Ubuntu activities and more.

=== Booth Box Ideas ===
Modeled after the success of the Gnome booth box, this is an instant fair booth box. It contains all equipment necessary to run a booth. When you organize a booth, you receive it. When someone else wants to organize a booth, you send it to them.

And don't forget the booth box inventory list!!

=== The weeks before the fair ===
*** announce your fair presence at <nowiki>[[ConferenceAppearances]]</nowiki>
*** finding volunteers:
****** launch the question onto the mailing list
****** ask volunteers to reply to the mailing list, to encourage others to participate
****** find a second person to confirm his participation before adressing the mailing list
****** ask possible volunteers as directly as possible: in person, phone, messaging, mail
*** funding:
****** ask for a non-profit, non-selling discount! ubuntu is popular and will draw people to the fair!
****** be prepared to pay for the booth yourself
****** make it easy for people to make a free contribution at the fair
*** bootstrapping a booth box:
****** often easier to get contributions in kind: let the mailing list know what you need!
****** fairs are a nice place to buy
****** let it grow slowly
****** buy compact (e.g. TFT monitors instead of CRTs)
****** buy quality (e.g. plastic poster instead of paper one)
****** buy flexible, low tech, cheap (e.g. free black and white copier leaflets instead of full colour ofset printing)
*** logistics:
****** many volunteers have no cars! logistics!
****** getting the heavy stuff to the fair
****** borrowing from other booths at the fair
****** sending the booth box around

=== The hour before the fair ===
* set up the booth:
****** news flash & volunteer fill out lists:
********* take enough pens and fix them to the booth with rope
****** consistency and simplicity:
********* 1 flyer visible: present Ubuntu itself and your team
********* keep specialised flyers away from the booth desk, but available:
************ what is free software, especially why "something for nothing" is possible with free software
************ kubuntu, edubuntu, xubuntu
************ Open''''''Office.org -> ODF ISO standard; what are open standards
****** table cloth identifies and unifies the booth

* When the booth is ready, do a role play a few times: a visitor passes:
****** what does the visitor see first?
********* does the visitor see a presentation about Ubuntu, whatever side the visitor passes from?
****** do they receive a flyer?
****** does someone start a conversation with them?
********* conversation:
************ WRONG: "Hello sir/madam, do you know what Ubuntu is?"
************ RIGHT: try to connect to positive experiences: 3 times "yes" and you have a psychological grip :)
****** the visitor is a child (children attract parents!) => do we have:
********* stickers/plush toys/candy/similar
********* games (preferably 3d): planet penguin racer, ...
****** the visitor is a woman:
********* Remember tips from <nowiki>[[http://www.valhenson.org/howto.html|HOWTO Encourage Women in Linux]]</nowiki>
****** the visitor is a journalist: do we have business cards ready?
****** the visitor is a bling lover: do we have a beryl/compiz demo ready?
* schedule breaks!
******* food breaks: volunteers need to eat
******* photo breaks: pictures taken at the busiest moments are the most interesting
* are there enough C''''''Ds? if not: start burning
****** insert them into paper cd bags with transparent window together with a regional LoCo team flyer
****** continue burning during the fair
******* shows the powers of free software in practice

=== The booth itself ===

*** Think about your target audience!
*** We are teasing visitors into trying Ubuntu. This is a big jump already. Keep their experience simple and consistent!
*** A booth is also a social event between volunteers!
*** Enthusiasm sells: don't be afraid to go after every single passerby.
*** Never ever interrupt another volunteer when they are dealing with a visitor, unless that volunteer begs you for input.
*** Mentor each other. Observe another volunteer's way of talking to a visitor. Afterwards, discuss about good and bad effects. Switch roles and repeat.

=== After the fair ===
Do a short debriefing, preferably over a drink or food. Create a small report about the event and send it to your LoCo team mailing list.
* What went really well/wrong?
* Did anyone try something new? Did it work? Is it already listed in this how-to?
* How many newsletter subscriptions did you get?
* How many donations did you receive?
* How many C''''''Ds did you distribute?
* Did you feel this event was worth the effort? Why (not)?

=== Ideas: to be sorted ===

*** organize introduction course/ install party at a less busy moment during fair?
*** Belgium specific: demo an ID card reader.
*** Nelson Mandela video: attractive, and not only to hippies, women, non-technical users
*** presentation machine (introduction)
*** elaborate free contribution
*** explain the freedom model, mix with
****** Shuttleworth the rich space tourist
****** Open''''''Office.org
****** Firefox
*** wish list: printed version at the booth
*** do something interesting on the screens
*** people in front & behind the booth table is easier to demonstrate
*** visibility in height: poles, rope, tape
*** list potential volunteers
*** list of potentially interested people
*** <nowiki>[[ConferenceTopTips]]</nowiki> lists some BRILLIANT hints
