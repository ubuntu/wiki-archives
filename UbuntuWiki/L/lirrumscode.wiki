=== About Me ===
{{ https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1290153834057281537/hVC2oQ30_400x400.jpg }}

My name is Lina Castro, I am a software developer with specialization in mobile application development, I am a Linux enthusiast but mostly Ubuntu, I am always helping and contributing to the community in Colombia, my country of origin, I am currently the leader of the Ubuntu Colombia community and I am a member of the Council of the same.

In 2019 I was part of the Flisol Bogota, the largest free software festival in Colombia and Latin America, where thousands of people attended the different open source technology talks that were taking place on April 25, since Due to the pandemic this was carried out virtually.

I am currently working as a teacher at Platzi, a technology company well known throughout Latin America, where they teach programming topics & also servers (such as Ubuntu servers) and where I continuously promote and disseminate the use of technologies and free software for the entire community.
