__TOC__

As of January 2015 I'm stepping back from leadership in the California team. I will stay involved and continue to host events, but during my tenure as a leader I gained access to and became responsible for many things in the team. The team, along with the new leadership, can work to determine how to share these responsibilities moving forward.
