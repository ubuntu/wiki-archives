__TOC__


* Contact: DmitriyGeels

* Make: Packard Bell (manufactured by Asus)

* Brand: EasyNote

* Model: BG46-T-001RU (T32E by Asus), this model has different configurations for each distribution region

* Website: http://www.packardbell.ru/products/%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%83%D1%82%D0%B1%D1%83%D0%BA%D0%B8/easynote-bg/EasyNote+BG46-T-001RU/productsheet-PC12E05944-1564.html

=== Current Issues ===
* Built-in camera is mounted upside-down. Camera driver needs to be patched to fix issue.
* Wifi currently can't be disabled by wifi switch (driver ath5k doesn't support rf kill switch yet). Wifi sensor itself and wifi led are working and handled by acpi scripts properly.
* Brightness control is not functional yet. Kernel patch should be applied.
* ECO sensor button isn't supported by asus-laptop module, it (and it's led) has default behavior determined by BIOS: enabling it decreases brightness to 6 (from 0..8 interval) disabling sets brightness to 8, also (according to some information from forums) it should be setting CPU throttling to 50%. One of asus-laptop developers told, that this button is entirely controlled by bios and it doesn't seem possible to disable this.

==== Notes ====

* Touchpad in this laptop is circular and it's hardware doesn't support mutitouch, so, it should use settings, different from default ones.
* LCD on/off button actually doesn't switch off lcd, just backlight
