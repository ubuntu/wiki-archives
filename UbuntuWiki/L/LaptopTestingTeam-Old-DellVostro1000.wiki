=== Current Issues ===
The pre-packaged bcm43xx drivers for the built-in wireless NIC do not work. I was able to get the wireless to work after downloading firmware using the restricted driver manager. This means that if you want to make wireless internet work, you have to have a (wired) internet connection to download the drivers.

==== Notes ====
The ONLY issue I've had with this laptop is the built-in wireless card. Everything else works right out of the box.

* The wireless drivers can be downloaded with ubuntu's restricted driver manager. This is a fairly easy and user friendly process provided you have a wired internet connection.

* *Booting Ubuntu Hardy Heron 8.04 LTS with an external monitor works. The monitor is cloned automatically. But the CRT/LD switch hotkey doesn't work.

* **Workaround for brightness up/down keys detailed in <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/159255|bug report #159255]]</nowiki>. Appears to be fixed in 8.10 Intrepid.
