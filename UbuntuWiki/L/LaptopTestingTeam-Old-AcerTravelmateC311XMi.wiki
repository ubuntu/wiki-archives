==== Notes ====
1. Num pad works perfectly when using it with Num Lock
3. Integrated cardreader should read MMC, SD, MS and MS-Pro. Tested only with MMC and SD and miniSD. Doesn't find MMC. SD finds 1GB cards but not 2GB. Supports every memorycard if using usb-cardreader.
4. Seems to go down just fine but waking up doesn't work. Restarting X fixes this. ''Sometimes going to hibernation fails and when trying to recover saved session is lost and new session starts''
