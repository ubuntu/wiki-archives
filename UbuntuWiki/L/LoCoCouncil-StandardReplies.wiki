== Page containing standard replies to use in a couple of scenarios ==

After realizing some sent messages are often similar, this page should help guide the council members to what should be sent back to the users, in a variety of scenarios:

=== Users (as individuals) trying to join the Verified Local Teams and/or Ubuntu Local Community Teams ===

    Thanks for your interest in the LoCo Teams project! This team is for
    LoCo Teams themselves, specifically verified ones. If you feel strongly
    about supporting LoCo teams join http://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-loco-
    enthusiasts instead.

    If you have further questions, feel free to contact loco-
    contacts@lists.ubuntu.com or loco-council@lists.ubuntu.com. You can also
    find us on IRC at #ubuntu-locoteams on Freenode.

=== If LoCos, after requesting feedback when they have applied to a material sponsorship ===

==== A suggestion that depends on the situation ====

    There is someone at Canonical that takes care of getting the items for you. We are usually contacted when the 
    requests can raise any doubts. Yours hasn't been the case as we have not been contacted but we have no way to 
    know how things are going. We will ask what's the status on this though.

    We understand your concern but we can ensure you they ship it UPS Worlwide 2-day, so despite some custom 
    delays can occur, there should be plenty of time to get you equipped for the next event.
