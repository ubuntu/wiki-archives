==== Fixing Issues ====

* Intel Wireless LAN
To get wireless working with Hardy you have take the following steps:

- Download wireless compat 

<pre>
wget http://linuxwireless.org/download/compat-wireless-2.6/compat-wireless-old.tar.bz2
</pre>

- Untar the driver in /usr/src

<pre>
sudo su
cd /usr/src
tar xjf compat-wireless-old.tar.bz2
cd compat-wireless-2008-08-06
</pre>

- Edit the config.mk and add the following two lines to get 5100 support

<pre>
CONFIG_IWL5000=y
CONFIG_IWLWIFI_RFKILL=y
</pre>

- Download firmware

<pre>
wget http://www.intellinuxwireless.org/iwlwifi/downloads/iwlwifi-5000-ucode-5.4.A.11.tar.gz
</pre>

- Untar the firmware and copy it to the current kernel firmware libraries

<pre>
tar xzf iwlwifi-5000-ucode-5.4.A.11.tar.gz
sudo cp iwlwifi-5000-1.ucode /lib/firmware/2.6.24-19-generic/
</pre>

- Now go back to the driver (/usr/src/compat-wireless-2008-08-06) and make it

<pre>
sudo su
make
make install
make load
</pre>

==== Notes ====

Test is still in progress for Karmic
