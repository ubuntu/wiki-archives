== Who Am I ==

I am currently working as software engineer with Canonical's sustaining engineering team.  My primary activities are fixing bugs, making them available in stable releases through the SRU process, collaborate with upstream developers, both in the Debian Project and upstream to fix root cause bugs and make them available downstream.
