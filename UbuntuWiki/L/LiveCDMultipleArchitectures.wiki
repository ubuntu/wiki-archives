=== Summary ===

The live CD should have the squashfs-es for all architectures on it and should be multiboot compatible.  Casper should be taught how to choose the right squashfs-es.

=== Rationale ===

 Having a single disc which can be used to boot any of the supported architectures would be useful and nice.

=== Use cases ===

* Tollef has a rescue DVD in his backpack.  Sometimes, he needs to rescue IA32 machines, sometimes AMD64 machines and sometimes PowerPC machines.  Having a single disc makes it less fiddly to carry around.

=== Scope ===

=== Design ===

=== Implementation ===

==== Code ====

==== Data preservation and migration ====

=== Outstanding issues ===

=== BoF agenda and discussion ===
