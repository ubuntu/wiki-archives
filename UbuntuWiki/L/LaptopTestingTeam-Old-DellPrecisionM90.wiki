=== Current Issues ===
* Issues in Edgy
** The internal speakers are not muted when headphones are plugged in.
** The WiFi interface does not work when starting from a hibernated state. <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/powersave/+bug/94133|Bug 94133]]</nowiki>.  A possible workaround is mentioned in the bug report.
** When resuming from hibernation the display is sometimes full of random garbage (Nvidia driver problem?)
* Issues in Feisty
** The WiFi interface does not work when starting from a hibernated or sleeping state. <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/powersave/+bug/94133|Bug 94133]]</nowiki>. A possible workaround is mentioned in the bug report.
** The internal speakers are sometimes not muted correctly when starting from a hibernated or sleeping state with headphones plugged in. The mute switch is apparently implemented in software.
* Issues in Hardy
** The computer hibernates, but does not power off. Pressing the power button for 3 seconds will turn off the power.
** Resuming from sleeping or hibernated state sometimes fails because of keyboard and/or graphics problems.
