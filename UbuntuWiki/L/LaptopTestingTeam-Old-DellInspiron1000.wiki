==== Notes ====

I used Edgy Knot 3 for the development release testing. At the time of this writing, I have had no serious issues at all with my normal tasks with this laptop under Edgy. I did have issues installing with the Knot 3 alternate CD, where the installer would not even start properly. Using the desktop CD rectified these problems. During boot, the usplash has a tendency to disappear for a few moments and then reappear. Because I had no such issue under dapper, I am inclined to attribute it to Edgy Eft. 

This laptop, being nearly two years old now, lacks many of the fancy features of modern laptops. There is no integrated wireless or CPU frequency scaling.

I am especially happy to see that both Suspend and Hibernate work under Edgy, where they were broken under Dapper
