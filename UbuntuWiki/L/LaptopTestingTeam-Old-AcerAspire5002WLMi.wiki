==== Notes ====
There is a Howto about $ and € keys:
http://personales.ya.com/sucotronic/archives/06-01-2007_06-30-2007.html
but I didn't test it yet because I don't use my Acer anymore (I have 2 laptops). -- AzraelNightwalker

There is another howto on <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LaptopTestingTeam/AcerAspire5610#head-c32b7f7a26c28c9c6d0106485f8c4d6b2433e390|the AcerAspire5610 page]]</nowiki> - I don't know if it works.
