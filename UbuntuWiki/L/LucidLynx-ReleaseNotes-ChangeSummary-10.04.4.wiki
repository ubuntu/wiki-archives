__TOC__


The following is a summary of bugs '''fixed''' between Ubuntu 10.04.3 and 10.04.4. '''This summary covers only changes to packages in ''__main__'' and ''__restricted__'', which account for all packages in the officially-supported CD images; there are further changes to various packages in ''universe'' and ''multiverse''.''' Some of these fixes were by Ubuntu developers directly, while others were by upstream developers and backported to Ubuntu. For full details, see the individual package changelogs.

In addition to the fixed bugs listed below, this update includes all security updates from the <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/usn|Ubuntu Security Notice list]]</nowiki> affecting Ubuntu 10.04 LTS that were released up to and including 13 February 2012. The last update included was USN-1360-1.

To understand the changes made:
* between Ubuntu 10.04 and Ubuntu 10.04.1, please see the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LucidLynx/ReleaseNotes/ChangeSummary/10.04.1|10.04.1 change summary]]</nowiki>; 
* between Ubuntu 10.04.1 and Ubuntu 10.04.2, see the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LucidLynx/ReleaseNotes/ChangeSummary/10.04.2|10.04.2 change summary]]</nowiki>  
* between Ubuntu 10.04.2 and Ubuntu 10.04.3, see the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LucidLynx/ReleaseNotes/ChangeSummary/10.04.3|10.04.3 changes summary]]</nowiki>.

This is the last planned point release update to be issued for 10.04,  SRU's will continue to be issued until EOL.

== Known Issues ==

If you are trying to create an installation CD or USB for a 10.04 based release from a 10.10 or later system, you may run into Bug:645818.  The workaround is documented in the report.  Typing 'live' or 'help' (without the quotes) at the boot: prompt allows the user to proceed with the installation.

On Ubuntu 10.04.4 Alternate image, under some conditions, ltsp client is not able to load boot file.  The following workaround and further information can be found in Bug:813837. 
<pre>
Change the line in /etc/ltsp/dhcpd.conf from
    filename "/ltsp/amd64.tmp/pxelinux.0";
to
    filename "/ltsp/amd64/pxelinux.0";
</pre>

On the Ubuntu 10.04.4 DVD, for i386, the linux-backports-modules-wireless-lucid-server depends on a package that only exists on an amd64 system and should not be used.   On the DVD for amd64 systems,  linux-backports-modules-wireless-lucid-generic-pae depends on an i386 package, which is not available and should not be used.

<<BR>>

== Changes Since 10.04.3 ==

=== Installation and Boot Fixes ===

Updated CD images are provided with this release, including fixes for some installation bugs. (Many installation problems are hardware-specific; for those, see "Hardware support bugs" below.)
