LoCos need to collaborate closer with other teams such as marketing, artwork, etc.

Last year, Richard Weideman requested that LoCos appoint an education contact to provide a communication link between local areas and Edubuntu. This is probably an idea that could and in some cases should be implemented with other team as well, for example Marketing Team especially in regard to the UWN, and maybe even Artwork team as many LoCos seem to want localised artwork, etc.
