__TOC__

Team names on Launchpad ( lp ) should all adhere to the naming convention for LoCos.

The standard is as follows

<code>ubuntu-xx</code>

where <code>xx</code> is the ISO naming convention of the Country.

In the case of the United States, where states have their own LoCos, the naming convention should be:

<code>ubuntu-us-yy</code>

where <code>yy</code> is the US State code.
