==== Notes ====
Vertical scroll can stop function seemingly randomly, although it seems to happen when the lock touchpad button is used but not consistently.

When unlocking the touchpad with the hardware button the help browser is launched, only current work around is to remove the keyboard shortcut for launching the help browser, this will also disable the Fn+F1 shortcut.

===== Wireless =====

To the the wireless card working a patched Madwifi is required. This is what I did to get it working.

First of all we need to stop the ath_hal module from loading. We do this by adding it to the list of disabled modules in /etc/default/linux-restricted-modules-common 

Open linux-restricted-modules-common in gedit
<pre>
gksudo gedit /etc/default/linux-restricted-modules-common
</pre>

Add ath_hal to the DISABLED_MODULES="" section so the file looks like this
<pre>
 
DISABLED_MODULES="ath_hal"
</pre>

Now we need to install build-essential, download and extract the madwifi snapshot and patch, patch the snapshot and then install the patched driver
<pre>
sudo apt-get install build-essential
wget 'http://madwifi.org/attachment/ticket/1679/madwifi-ng-0933.ar2425.20071130.i386.patch?format=raw'
wget http://snapshots.madwifi.org/madwifi-ng/madwifi-ng-r2756-20071018.tar.gz
tar zxvf madwifi-ng-r2756-20071018.tar.gz
cd madwifi-ng-r2756-20071018
patch -p0 < ../madwifi-ng-0933.ar2425.20071130.i386.patch\?format\=raw
make clean
make
sudo make install
</pre>

Now all you have to do is reboot and your wireless will be working.
