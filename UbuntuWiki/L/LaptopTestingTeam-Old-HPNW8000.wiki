=== Current Issues ===
resume after suspend '''now''' working, Card Reader not working, screen dpi incorrect
* ''What is the DPI set to, what should it be set to?'' -PaulSladen
Native DPI is 133. It gets set to 96 DPI by default

* ''I think for this HP laptop we need to feed the cardreader a firmware blob, which is problematic'' -PaulSladen
So I understand. But are there tools available to load such a blob?

* ''As well as the above too, please also file a bug on the suspend issue;  we're particular keen to have HP laptops work..!  ;-)'' -PaulSladen
Done: <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/bugs/37672|#37672]]</nowiki>

* ''ACPI Suspend & Hibernate do not appear to work. The monitor goes blank, and the laptop appears to hang.'' -PhilipWoods2

External Monitor does not appear to have been checked and does not work for me under Ibex. --- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:dmbfan2007]]</nowiki>
