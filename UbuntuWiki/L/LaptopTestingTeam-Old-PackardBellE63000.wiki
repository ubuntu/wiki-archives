=== Current Issues ===
The video card of this model is a S3 Unichrome Pro (K8M800) model.  The driver inside X.org does not have full support for this card, and the reworked driver is not yet available.  Thus, you have to use X in VESA compatibility mode, which yields a 1024x768 resolution.  Both the S-Video and RGB ports for the external monitor are not available.

The modem is a winmodem (AC97 based), and probably uses a proprietary driver.

ACPI needs tweaking: I needed to explicitely enable hibernating and sleeping by editing /etc/defaults/acpi-support.

The PCCard reader needs also tweaking with the yenta_socket module, using the override_bios property.
