=== Current Issues ===

* Needs apic to be disabled in kernel to run
* Installation didn't start. I didn't go through this, just turn it to text installer (debian installer) and it works. Probably issue was with ATI driver (see next)
* fglrx driver works after some tweaking. You need to change BIOS parameter to allow UMA+Sideport video memory (share 128mb) in order to avoid black screen on X start.
* DRI do not work, and should be disabled. I have read around that this problem is only with Xorg 7.0, and it worked in 6.8 and it is adresed in 7.1, but I haven't tested yet.
* Wireless work, but I need to use Ndiswrapper, and made a simbolik link from the configuration file created by the windows driver to the right PCI name of the card (14E4:4318.5.conf -> 14E4:4319.5.conf)
