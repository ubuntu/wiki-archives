__TOC__

== Anna Baas / lenale ==

I work as a junior software engineer at a tech company in the Netherlands. I like cats, knowledge and sustainability in the broadest sense of the word. Global free (as in speech and beer) communities with local networks are essential for long-term social and environmental sustainability. Good work, Ubuntu.

=== Ubuntu ===

* I use an old MacBook Pro for personal use, and Windows 7 at work. Uhm.

* I set up several non-techie family members with Ubuntu after my free software propaganda got to them.

* While tech-supporting them I received so much friendly help from the community that I wanted to do something back

* I am now involved in translating the Ubuntu Women wiki into Dutch.

* In time, I would really like to contribute as a developer.
