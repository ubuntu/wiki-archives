=== Linux History ===
I tried Fedora several times, but with no help, I missed mp3's and DVD's really quickly, and couldn't figure out that you were supposed to install them after. So I gave up on fedora.

I was itching to switch to Linux as we were getting the internet soon. A friend of mine gave me a copy of Slackware 9.
It took getting used to, but I was hooked. Later, Due to dependency hell, I switched to Gentoo, one of the most 
powerful operating systems I have ever used.

For binary and stability issues, I switched to Kubuntu Edgy and have been alpha testing every new release.

Mostly I try to convert friends and am the ultimate resource to those around me for Linux knowledge. 
I was the guy who set up other's xorg.conf or the sources.list, both no longer issues.

I am a huge Kubuntu and KDE enthousiast, and am going to college to learn programming so I can help out KDE projects.
