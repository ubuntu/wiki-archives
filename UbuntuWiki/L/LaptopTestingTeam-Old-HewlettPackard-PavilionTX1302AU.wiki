=== Current Issues ===

Wireless works with ndiswrapper on Gutsy and Hardy.
Hardy's (kernel 2.6.24) b43 driver does not yet support the revision 2 of Broadcom 4312.
I believe it should work with newer kernels so looking forward to Intrepid Ibex.

The AuthenTec AES1610 fingerprint reader was working with poor scans with the "fprint" project.
http://reactivated.net/fprint/wiki/Main_Page
After the move to new libusb the AES1610 driver has not been ported as of May 2008.

Touchscreen works well for me (VishalRao) with the EETI TouchKit driver version 2.02.1615 for Hardy amd64.
An older driver was listed at http://www.eeti.com.tw/ whos module would not load in Hardy with an "old version"
error in Xorg's log. I emailed the support contact and they quickly sent me the latest 64 bit driver which loaded and worked very well.

Most of the Fn "function" and special keys work on Gutsy and Hardy. The ones on the screen for rotate/media do not.

==== Notes ====
For the touchscreen to work in Hardy amd64:
Get the latest TouchKit driver from www.eeti.com.tw.
The 1.08.xxxx driver does not load in X with an "old version" error.
The 2.02.1615 package worked very well.
Unzip the package and follow the manual steps in GUIDE.PDF.
I specified the device option as "usbauto" which translated to /dev/usb/hiddev0.
I have Hardy's default usbtouchscreen and usbhid modules loaded.
In the device section for the EETI/egalax module I also needed to add:
 <code>Option "CorePointer"</code>
to prevent stylus single taps from sending 2 click events.
I did the 25 pts calibration using the TouchKit utility.

The built-in webcam works in Ekiga (V4L2) and Cheese.
