__TOC__

* Contact: Joan Tur
* Brand: LG
* Make : LW
* Model: LW20-34DB
* Website: http://www.lge.com/products/model/detail/lw20%20express.jhtml

=== Current Issues ===
* Last installation steps were done "blind", only pressing the enter key, as there was no info on screen (I used Kubuntu 6.06.1 alternate CD (md5 verified)

* It doesn't power off after the shutdown procedure is done (reboot works fine)

* 915resolution package has to be installed to use the native lcd resolution: 1280x800 (no configuration is needed)

* The integrated card reader needs 2.6.17 kernel to work; also, "setpci -s 06:00.3 4c=0x22" needs to be run for it to work. Tested with SD cards

* The wifi card (ipw2200) needs the "led=1" option to power on the wifi led

* HD's IO_support shows value 0 (16 bit), and cannot be set to 1 (32 bit). Anyway hdparm shows 18MB/s transfer rate.  UPDATE: this seems to be normal for SATA disks

* Modules sdhci & mmc_core have to be removed before trying to suspend or hibernate
