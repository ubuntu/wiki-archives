=== Current Status/Issues ===
==== Hoary ====
Mostly functional but audio and wifi were problematic so I moved to
==== Intrepid ====
Working quite well!  Currently having issues with:
 - Fails to recover from sleeping, possibly "ata1 exception"?  Will investigate.
 - Dim/brighten control work at startup but cease working some time later.
