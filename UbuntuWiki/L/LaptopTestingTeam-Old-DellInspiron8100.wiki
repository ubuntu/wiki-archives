=== Current Issues ===
Many issues if you don't have the latest BIOS. With the A15 BIOS, the issues seem to be reduced to the following:

- Ubuntu loads the wrong SpeedStep driver, causing the system to freeze for about 1 second every few seconds. The laptop feels very slow and laggy like this and its extremely annoying... in order to fix it, modify /usr/share/cpufreqd/cpufreq-detect.sh and hardcode PIII_MODULE=speedstep-ich after the if statement attempts to set it.
* PLEASE file this as a bug and attach 'cat /proc/cpuinfo' and 'dmidecode' output to it.
* There is already a bug filed for it, I just attached dmidecode to it: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/powernowd/+bug/24353
- The laptop will not wake up after you suspend it, and the system never hibernates. No known fix yet.
- Hotplugging drives in the modular bay (both the removal and addition event) usually causes bad things to happen, like a crash... if it doesn't crash, it never works at the very least.
- The internal WinModem has no drivers

==== Notes ====
Disk drive hot-swapping causes crashes (except if you hot-swap a battery into the slot). Many features require a BIOS upgrade to fix bugs.

== Latest Retest ==

  Make: Dell

  Brand: Inspiron

  Model: 8100

=== Current Issues ===
Power management (still) does not work (hibernation, suspending, even closing the lid). Closing the lid will cause the system to crash. 

=== System Info ===
system-manufacturer: DELL

system-product-name: INSPIRON

system-version: A15

system-ram: 512 MB

system-CPU: 1.13/0.77 GHz Pentium III

The play/pause, stop, previous track and next track buttons only work with Rhythmbox and Totem, not with Amarok.

For 3D acceleration to work, you need to install drivers.

USB keyboards work with this laptop too.
