==== Notes ====
Note1: I don't have an option to Hibernate, it's not a Mac thing, so i don't how it works exactly. Sleep works though.

Note2: The sound works correctly from alsamixer, but the function keys are not correctly handled sometimes.

Note3: This is the Airport Extreme card, I have gotten it to work using the Apple Firmware.
