=== Current Issues ===
No issues with Ubuntu Hardy Heron 8.04.  This laptop works perfectly out of box with Hardy Heron.

I have an issue to report on the Load_Cycle_Count for this particular laptop with an Hitachi hard drive.  To correct the frequent load cycles visit the Ubuntu Power Management wiki.

https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PowerManagement

This corrects the frequent load cycles in Hardy, Intrepid fixes most of the problems.
