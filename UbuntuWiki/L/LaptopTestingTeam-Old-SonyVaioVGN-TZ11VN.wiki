=== Current Issues ===

Camera Motion Eye: Not working
Sound: All detected as HDA Intel but not sound at all.
Hibernate/Resume: Not Working but in 7.04 it does perfectly, something wrong with Gutsy Gibbons.
Fingerprint reader: Not working out the box, but I think that with bioapi I can make it...we will see.
Starting Session: It stay 10 seconds and then launch. I think something is waiting for something but I don't see any crash.
