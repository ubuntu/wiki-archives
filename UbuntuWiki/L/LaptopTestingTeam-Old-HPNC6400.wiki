==== Issues and Resolutions ====

1) Problems with keyboard after sleep

Once bind/unbind is added to make the keyboard work after suspend, /etc/default/acpi-support has to be modified to unload psmouse and to do the double-console-switch

2) SD Card does not auto-mount when SD card is inserted.

Add the following line to your startup scripts:
 setpci -s 02:06.2 4c.b=02

3) Fingerprint Reader does not work

There is a working driver available at <nowiki>[[http://www.ag-networking.com/]]</nowiki>, however, it does nothing more other than report a swiped finger.  No authentication is available yet.

4) ATI users unable to get a display while using livecd or after an alternative cd install

Obtain and internet connection and install the ATI proprietary drivers:
 sudo apt-get install xorg-drivers-fglrx
