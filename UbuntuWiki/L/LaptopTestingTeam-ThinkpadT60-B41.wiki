==== Notes ====
The first try for installing did not work see <nowiki>[[http://launchpad.net/bugs/42339|#42339]]</nowiki>. However the second try succeded. 

I got wireless to work by installing ipw3945-1.0.0 and ieee80211-1.1.13. However the GNOME Network Manager has disappeared and I did not manged to restart. I am using KWIFIManager currently.
I installed SMP package for dual core support.

Note that the T60 is almost identical to the T60p (the T60p may have a better CPU\ram\LCD etc.., but most of the hardware is the same or similar).
