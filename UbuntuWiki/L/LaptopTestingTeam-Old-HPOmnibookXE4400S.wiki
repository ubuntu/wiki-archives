=== Current Issues ===
1) Trackpad issues: Right side of trackpad is recognized as scroll area, but there's already a dedicated scroll area built into the trackpad, so there is just too much scroll area.

2) Volume control works but often displays on the screen and in the mixer as  mute, so there's often no way to tell in the OS what the volume level is. 

3) Hotkeys (email, TV, www, lock, ?) on keyboard don't work. 

4) Gutsy sometimes doesn't known how much battery power I have left. It says: "Computer is running on battery power; laptop battery discharging (0%); battery discharge time is currently unknown. 

5) To get 3D enabled, I had to switch the video driver from ati (default) to radeon, and tweak it quite a bit. Still though, I can't get a color depth bigger than 24 bits. 

6) Glxgears only gets about 200-300fps with my current setup, is that normal for a laptop with these specifications? 

7) Network connection (the eth0 module) is gone when returning from standby.
