I am currently "testing on the fly" using this Gateway for work & school.<<BR>>
 -- I had 6.10 LTS and Gutsy 7.10 loaded and dual booting w/M$.<<BR>>
----
Links to GW's site are here for you to confirm any hardware questions etc...<<BR>>
The Photo confirms we're using the "swivel touchscreen", as do the viewable ports and other features. The "touchscreen" and "stylus" have been a thorn in our side and will be documented and added to the forum, when fixed and working.<<BR>>
----
=== Other non-functional features ===

Pointing Devices: Gateway Executive Stylus with Gateway Continuous Sensing Technology<<BR>>
Buttons: 4-way Scroll and Select, Screen Rotation Button, Windows Security Button, Windows Journal Button (programmable).

=== Current Issues ===

 { This is the Wiki, Feel Free to add in a helpful way! }
* As of 2008-04-24, Sound Preference GUI: locks up when testing microphone.
* None of the (above) Notebook features work...yet!
* Not an issue  * Continue to see "double-blurred" Gateway Logo {BIOS ?}-- when booting into either version.

=== Personal Stuff ===

My Graphic Card died. Or whatever it is...as I'm unable to track what exactly it is ~ embedded on the MB?<br>
References to Graphics, turn up a Viper - Motherboard with ATI 64MB Video (FRU).
If someone could lend some advice - so I can fix and use this thing ~ It be great!!!

=== System Info ===

Output of the following commands:
 <code>$ uname -a</code> : Linux 2.6.22-16-386 and 2.6.22-14-generic <<BR>>
 <code>$ sudo dmidecode -s system-manufacturer</code> : Gateway <<BR>>
 <code>$ sudo dmidecode -s system-product-name</code> : M285-E <<BR>>
 <code>$ sudo dmidecode -s system-version</code> : 3402687 <<BR>>
 <code>$ lspci</code> : 01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc Radeon Mobility X1400 <<BR>>

=== Hardware details ===

I cannot include any info concerning Edgy 7.04 as I could not get it installed.<<BR>>
I'll leave tagged "n/a" for features I am unable to test and leave them open for change--if someone else can confirm and add.<<BR>>
I also have no bug report information--because of lack of time to put into it.
