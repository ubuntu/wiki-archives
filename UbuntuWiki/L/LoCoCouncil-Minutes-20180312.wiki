 20:26 <meetingology> Motion carried

 20:26 <kenvandine> sorry :)

 20:26 <kenvandine> i missed that part

 20:26 <kyrofa> Haha, no problem, I guess that only works if you're a chair

 20:26 <kenvandine> yeah

 20:27 <kenvandine> i thought since i added required votes it was automatic

 20:27 <kenvandine> i've updated MyanmarTeam's status in LP already

 20:27 <kyrofa> Yeah you'd think so

 20:27 <kokoye2007> Thank sir

 20:27 <kokoye2007> any suggestion for ubuntu-mm ?

 20:28 <kyrofa> We technically have SwissTeam on our agenda as well, shall we discuss them quickly just for the meeting minutes?

 20:28 <kenvandine> kyrofa, yes

 20:28 <kenvandine> so the bug has enough +1s to pass

 20:28 <kyrofa> kokoye2007, only one: if you work to keep your pages up-to-date as you go, the re-verification app will be much easier

 20:29 <kyrofa> kenvandine, want to update the topic for the minutes?

 20:30 <kenvandine> sure

 20:30 <kenvandine> #topic Re-verification, ubuntu-ch

 20:31 <kenvandine> There was a bug filed to track getting some questions answered

 20:31 <kenvandine> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-locoteams/+bug/1750544

 20:31 <ubottu> Error: launchpad bug 1750544 not found

 20:31 <kenvandine> that private though :)

 20:32 <kyrofa> Yeah, timezones are different enough asynchronous seemed to be best

 20:32 <kyrofa> Long story short: the council voted to re-verify SwissTeam

 20:33 <kenvandine> 3 votes in favor

 20:33 <kenvandine> kyrofa, did you vote?  maybe i missed your's in the comments

 20:33 <kyrofa> kenvandine, I voted first! Haha

 20:33 <kyrofa> Four votes

 20:33 <kenvandine> 4 :)

 20:33 <kenvandine> so it passes

 20:33 <kenvandine> congratulations to the SwissTeam!

 20:35 <kenvandine> i guess that's it for this month

 20:35 <kyrofa> Indeed, if no one has any other business, that's it for our agenda

 20:35 <kenvandine> thanks everyone!
