<nowiki>[[http://www.lxle.net/Search.html|<nowiki>[[File:lxle-14x14.jpg]]</nowiki></nowiki>|target="_blank"]] googlxle

By default LXLE utilizes the <nowiki>[[DuckDuckGo]]</nowiki> search engine. The team believes in this search engine's principles, capabilities, support, and their many opensource (FOSS) initiatives. However, we realize that some users still prefer to search with Google, so we designed a custom Google search engine for our LXLE startpage for those individuals.

Googlxle, LXLE's custom Google search engine does much more than just provide a gateway to Google, it borrows some ideas from DuckDuckGo's awesome search engine like enabling SSL search by default and ommiting known content mills while emphazing results from crowd sourced sites and their sources, bearing excellent returns. Googlxle is a form of Google, minus a lot of controvertial annoyances.
