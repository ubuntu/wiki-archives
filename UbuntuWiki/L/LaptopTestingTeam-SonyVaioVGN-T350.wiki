=== Current Issues ===
Audio is initially silent. To enable it, one has to go to volume regulation, "preferences", select "external amplifier" and set it to mute.

Scrolling doesn't work no more from Gutsy to Hardy Alpha 2. Maybe it's wanted (it had some problems with mute), otherwise it's a regression.

Volume up/down buttons give the sami ACPI signals and keycodes, so they are unusable.
"DVD" button too gives the same keycode.

Mute button is hardware but gives a "mouse button 4" signal. I'm afraid there is no (software) way to give a working mute button /and/ scrolling capabilities, but if scrolling is indeed disabled (as it is now in Hardy), button 4 should just be recognized by default as "mute". Actually, it isn't and it isn't possible to map it with "keyboard shortcuts" (it isn't recognized).

PCMCIA had a regression: my "CISCO AIRONET 350" is no more recognized, dmesg says:

[  852.711225] pcmcia: registering new device pcmcia0.0

[  853.795829] airo(): Probing for PCI adapters
