As announced there by Stéphane Grabber, http://www.linux-archive.org/edubuntu-development/267937-ltsp-testing-jaunty.html

localapps in Jaunty have changed

Here's a quick Howto to get local apps (applications that are running on the thin client directly instead of running in the servers desktop session)

1. Create a new chroot chroot 

First, if you don't want to test on your i386 chroot, build a new chroot  with the same sources.list as the server.

<pre> 
sudo ltsp-build-client --chroot i386_w_localapps --copy-sourceslist
</pre>

2. Then install packages you want as localapps in the chroot

<pre>
sudo chroot /opt/ltsp/i386_w_localapps apt-get install firefox openoffice.org openoffice.org-l10n-fr vlc flashplugin-installer mplayer language-pack-fr language-pack-gnome-fr language-support-fr gimp
</pre>
As you can see, i'm a french user, so I installed language package...

If you want to run firefox as localapp, view this page https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuLTSP/LocalAppsResolvConf to correct the bug with resolv.conf

3. Then update your image
<pre>
sudo ltsp-update-image -a i386_w_localapps
</pre>

4. Then create ( or modify ) the lts.conf 

<pre>
sudo gedit /var/lib/tftpboot/ltsp/i386_w_localapps/lts.conf 
</pre>

and add these lines

<pre>
    LOCAL_APPS=True
    LOCAL_APPS_MENU = True
    LOCAL_APPS_MENU_ITEMS = firefox,mplayer,vlc,openoffice.org-calc,openoffice.org-draw,openoffice.org-impress,openoffice.org-math,openoffice.org-startcenter,openoffice.org-writer
</pre>

Where the LOCAL_APPS_MENU_ITEMS list comes from
 
<pre>
ls -1 /opt/ltsp/i386_w_localapps/usr/share/applications/| grep desktop | sed s/\.desktop/,/g | xargs | sed s/\ //g 
</pre>
No space in list, only comma separated

5. Change your /etc/ltsp/dhcpd.conf to have your client using the new chroot with localapps

6. Restart the dhcp 

<pre>
sudo /etc/init.d/dhcp3-server restart
</pre>
