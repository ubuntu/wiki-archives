<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 17:06:12] juju2143, I'm so sorry to be bothering you yet again but ping
<juju2143>	[Jun 22 17:06:40] pong?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 17:07:40] well, to publicize the class, we need either a short description or even maybe something about your experience related to C#.. something to say, basically, to go towards publicizing
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 17:14:53] juju2143, ^
<juju2143>	[Jun 22 17:20:43] ah ok
<juju2143>	[Jun 22 17:21:14] bah this is an introduction to C#
<juju2143>	[Jun 22 17:22:11] learnt it at school
<juju2143>	[Jun 22 17:22:13] etc.
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 19:03:43] bgs100, was there any homework?
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:04:28] one sec
* bgs100 [Jun 22 19:05:34] attempts to recall...
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:06:04] pedro3005, Don't think so
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 19:06:11] hah!
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:06:17] Hiya seidos
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 19:06:20] bgs100, did you continue the class after I left?
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:06:52] Not really
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 19:07:19] ok
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:07:30] We talked about prine based number systems and binary
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 19:08:15] hey seidos
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:09:34] brb
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:10:53] back
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:10:55] Sooooooo
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:11:06] Are we all ready to begin?
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:11:08] seidos, pedro3005 ?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 19:11:21] ARE YOU READY
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 19:11:27] :p
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 19:11:29] ready
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:11:31] TO ROCK?!
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 19:11:47] noo... >:(
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:11:57] I WANNA ROCK! YEAAHH ROCK YEEAHH ROCK YEEAHH
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:12:02] DA NA NA
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 19:12:11] bgs100, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JSgjQHPrTc
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:12:12] *wicked guitar solo*
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:12:27] oh
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:12:29] :P
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:12:46] seidos, ?
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:14:00] .........
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:14:12] I'll assume seidos will be here shortly
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:14:16] Now
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:14:23] Without Further Ado
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 19:14:33] THE C CLASS
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:14:54] -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= MAY ZE C CLASS =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:15:02] -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= BEGIN =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:15:29] So ya
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:15:43] Now
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:15:51] seidos, pedro3005 You pretty much know the base language
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:16:01] So give yourself a hearty pat on the back
* pedro3005 [Jun 22 19:16:04] dances around the room
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:16:09] or that
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:16:22] whatever *float*s your boat xD
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:16:48] Get it? Get it? *elbows pedro3005*
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 19:16:54] you've used that one before
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:16:59] No
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 19:17:04] yes you have
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:17:05] before I said No pun intended
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:17:13] Thsi time it's completely intended
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 19:17:14] well, still
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:17:18] This*
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:17:49] So
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:17:55] Now, we will be focusing upon:
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:18:05] ***THE STANDARD LIBRARY***
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:18:09] *Angels sing*
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 19:19:19] I read it more in a devilish frightening tone
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:19:28] ...
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:19:34] Well fix that
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:20:11] The standard library is sort of like the modules that Python always comes with. If it's normal C (e.g. your not building stuff for a kernel or embedded device), you'll have the standard library.
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:21:43] So
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:21:57] As you (*pings pedro3005 and seidos again*) know,
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:22:25] we have been using the standard library in every example thus far.
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 19:22:32] yes
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:23:05] There's not that much you can do without the standrad library, unless you use assembly with C.
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:23:20] stdio.h is part of the standard library
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:24:17] pedro3005, Your book should have a reference to the standard library in Appendix B
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 19:24:43] yes
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:25:07] For seidos: http://www.utas.edu.au/infosys/info/documentation/C/CStdLib.html looks pretty good
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 19:25:25] stdio, ctype, string, math, stdlib, assert, stdarg, setjmp, signal, time, limits, float
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:26:17] anyway.
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:26:30] I was thinking that today, we would start with string.h
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:27:11] string.h consists of functions useful for doing things with strings, as the name Oh-So-Discreetly implies
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:28:05] So
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:28:41] Allocating char pointers for strings yourself was mentioned yesterday.
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:28:57] However,
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:29:06] if you allocate it yourself and such,
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:29:13] how can you assign it to a string nicely?
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:29:23] If you do:
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:29:37] char *string = malloc(5);
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:29:46] later saying:
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:29:52] string = "book";
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:29:56] obviously won't work
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:30:11] since it just changes the address string has.
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 19:30:16] string = {'b', 'o', 'o', 'k'}
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 19:30:17] ?
<Snova>	[Jun 22 19:30:21] it's rather not obvious at all
<Snova>	[Jun 22 19:30:26] no
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:30:27] Same thing, except without a '\0'
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:30:38] Snova, It's a reassignment.
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:30:49] *shrugs*
<Snova>	[Jun 22 19:30:53] there is no way to assign to an array like that
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:30:56] Also, hai
<Snova>	[Jun 22 19:31:01] hello
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 19:31:06] did you read the malloc part earlier?
<Snova>	[Jun 22 19:31:12] uh, yes?
<Snova>	[Jun 22 19:31:43] malloc isn't relevant to this point; you can not assign the contents of an array except when initially declaring it
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 19:31:44] still no way?
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:31:50] Oh yeah
* bgs100 [Jun 22 19:31:55] facepalms
<Snova>	[Jun 22 19:31:59] i.e. int x[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; will work but you can't change the whole thing later on
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:32:15] Well, now there's two reasons it would not work. xP
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 19:32:41] Snova, isn't there someway to tell it to "forget" about the old x and just declare it again?
<Snova>	[Jun 22 19:32:42] "char* string = malloc(5); string = "book";" doesn't change the contents of the original allocation; it changes the pointer "string" to reference the constant string "book"
<Snova>	[Jun 22 19:32:45] it's also a memory leak
<Snova>	[Jun 22 19:32:48] pedro3005: no
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:33:02] Snova, That was my point...
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 19:33:29] god I hate C
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 19:33:33] :P
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:33:34] :|
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 19:34:37] you can't do anything
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 19:34:41] but go on
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:34:43] ...
<Snova>	[Jun 22 19:34:56] C has been called a "portable assembly"
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:35:17] pedro3005, Apparently, you can, considering many other languages' interpreters/compilers are written in it...
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:35:46] But Aaaannnyyywaaayyy
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:35:54] So yeah
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:37:05] Anyway
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:37:10] You could do this:
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:37:21] char *string = malloc(5);
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:37:36] strcpy(string, "book");
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:37:40] Correct, Snova?
<Snova>	[Jun 22 19:37:52] yes
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:37:57] Okay
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:38:01] Good :p
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:39:07] pedro3005, (since seidos doesn't seem to be present) strcpy take two char pointers/arrays and copies the contents of the second (including the '\0') into the first.
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 19:39:38] so basically it does string[0] = 'b'; etc?
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:39:46] strcpy = string copy, as you probably guessed.
<Snova>	[Jun 22 19:39:53] pedro3005: pretty much
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 19:40:13] okay
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:40:13] pedro3005, Or rather, string[0] = secondstring[0], but in this case yeah
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:41:09] Also
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:41:37] I should mention that for many str<blank> functions there are also strn<blank> functions,
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 19:42:09] what does that mean?
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:42:21] I'm typing :P
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:42:37] Those take an extra argument that makes it only do whatever for n characters
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:42:41] For example,
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:43:04] strncpy will only copy n characters to the first string
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:44:08] From the manpage for strcpy/strncpy: "The strncpy() function is similar, except that at most n bytes of src are copied."
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:44:22] src being the second string
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:44:28] pedro3005, Okay?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 19:44:31] example?
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:45:05] char *string = malloc(4);
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:45:17] strncpy(string, "book", 4);
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:45:19] HOWEVER
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:45:27] This will cut off the '\0' at the end
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 19:45:57] oh, so always +1
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:46:06] pedro3005, I might be used to make sure that the function doesn't copy past the first string's actual length.
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:46:15] pedro3005, er that's not the point :p
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:46:21] s/I/It/
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 19:46:41] oh, ok
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 19:46:52] this is somewhat confusing but alright
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:47:34] Okay
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:47:43] Next, we have strcat
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:48:21] Example:
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:48:46] char *string = malloc(9);
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:49:00] strcpy(string, "book");
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:49:09] strcat(string, "club");
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:49:16] string ends up being "bookclub"
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 19:49:54] so it adds it before the '\0' and makes sure there is not two '\0' at the end?
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:50:25] Yeah, pretty much.
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:50:41] Or rather just overwrites the first '\0' with the first character of the second string
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:50:54] and then copies the second strings '\0'
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 19:51:32] I see
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:51:40] But yeah, it appends string2 to string1, and if they're "normal" strings there won't be two '\0''s
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:51:47] So
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:51:55] Oh
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:52:02] And there's a "n" version of that too
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:52:15] Where only "n" characters from string2 are appended
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:53:17] Okay
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:53:18] strchr
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 19:53:18] ok
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:54:38] char *string = malloc(7);
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:55:09] strcpy(string, "cookie");
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:55:31] char *otherstring = strchr(string, 'o');
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:55:42] otherstring should now be the string "ookie"
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:55:55] However
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:56:01] Well
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:56:02] First
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:56:44] pedro3005, strchr returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the character ('o') in the string
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:57:02] Okay?
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:57:17] ...
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 19:57:23] brb, I have to... brush my teeth
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:57:27] ............
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:57:34] well okay then
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:57:45] Don't take too long :P
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:57:48] (jk)
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 19:59:12] bgs100, back
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:59:52] okay
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 19:59:59] pedro3005, So Okay about strchr?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 20:00:09] so strchr copies it starting from 'o'?
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 20:00:14] Uhh
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 20:00:23] I was about to get to that...
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 20:00:26] It doesn't copy it
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 20:00:41] oh
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 20:00:41] right
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 20:00:45] it returns it
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 20:00:56] If you changed string more than the first character, otherstring would change too
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 20:01:01] And vice versa
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 20:01:17] oh, because it returns a poinnnnnnter
* bgs100 [Jun 22 20:01:31] gives pedro3005 a star
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 20:01:36] well
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 20:01:38] not quite
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 20:01:45] If it copied it,
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 20:01:53] It would still be returning a pointer
* bgs100 [Jun 22 20:02:00] takes away half of the star
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 20:02:02] just a different one
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 20:02:15] Yea
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 20:03:59] Also
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 20:04:04] There is strrchr
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 20:04:20] It returns a pointer to the *last* occurence of a char
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 20:04:22] Like
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 20:04:26] If we had said:
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 20:04:35] char *otherstring = strrchr(string, 'o');
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 20:04:37] instead
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 20:04:44] otherstring would be "okie"
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 20:04:52] BTW
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 20:05:14] Both of these functions return NULL (secretly 0) if they can't find any of that character
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 20:05:57] pedro3005, 'kay?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 20:06:00] okay
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 20:06:29] good then
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 20:06:34] On to strcmp
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 20:07:07] String compare compares to strings
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 20:07:47] two*
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 20:07:53] lexicographically
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 20:09:20] Which is a very fancy term that means something similar to alphabetical order
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 20:09:28] pedro3005,
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 20:09:57] If string1 is "less than" string2 (e.g. "a" < "b"), strcmp returns less than 0
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 20:10:22] If string1 is "greater than" string2 (e.g. "z" > "y"), strcmp returns more than 0
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 20:10:30] what about
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 20:10:34] "2" - "a"
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 20:10:37] which "wins"?
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 20:10:49] If the two strings are equal (this is probably what strcmp is primarily used for), it returns 0
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 20:11:09] pedro3005,
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 20:11:27] I think it uses your character sets numbers for each
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 20:11:51] pedro3005, 2 is less than a, methinks
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 20:12:11] ok
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 20:12:13] Ah crap
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 20:12:17] I have to go for a few
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 20:12:36] 8sigh*
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 20:12:37] it's cool
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 20:12:42] I'll program something
* bgs100 [Jun 22 20:12:47] shakes fist at parents :P
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 20:12:52] bai
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 20:12:57] bbs
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 20:57:34] Baaack
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 20:57:39] pedro3005, Ping
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 20:57:50] hey
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 20:57:53] seidos is here too
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 20:59:55] ... I think
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 21:01:19] bgs100, >:(
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:05:37] HAI
<seidos>	[Jun 22 21:05:39] hey
<seidos>	[Jun 22 21:05:44] I'll have to read the logs of the class
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:05:45] seidos, Read the logs :P
<seidos>	[Jun 22 21:06:09] 22 isn't posted yet
<seidos>	[Jun 22 21:06:13] but I'll check back later
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 21:08:01] seidos, I have it
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 21:08:04] i'll paste them for you
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 21:08:50] seidos, http://paste.pocoo.org/show/228767/
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 21:09:55] bgs100, do you intend to continue on strings?
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:12:33] Yes
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:12:42] But not right now, unfortunatley :/
<seidos>	[Jun 22 21:14:47] too bad there aren't videos on learning C
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 21:14:55] seidos, there are
<seidos>	[Jun 22 21:14:57] too bad I can't just upload it all into my brain
<seidos>	[Jun 22 21:15:08] pedro3005, have you looked at any of them?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 21:15:17] nah
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 21:15:24] but I intend to.. some day
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 21:15:40] alright bgs100, bye
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:15:50] Well
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:15:52] Actually
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:15:55] i may be able to cintunue
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:16:00] continue*
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:16:15] Anyway
<Snova>	[Jun 22 21:16:47] bgs100: it's been thirty seconds!
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:17:09] ?
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:17:19] strcmp is most often used for seeing if two strings are equal
<Snova>	[Jun 22 21:17:44] isn't that the only thing it does? :p
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:18:04] I already talked about that
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:18:32] Look up.
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:19:54] I laready detailed the usage, I'm just adding on.
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:19:57] already*
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:20:02] Anyway
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:20:10] Example:
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:20:18] Ohwait
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:20:25] I should also mention
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:21:02] scanf can read in strings. It will continue until there is whitespace (a space, newline, or tab).
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:21:11] Continuing with the example:
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:21:40] char *string;
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:22:30] er
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:23:25] brb :p
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 21:25:23] he'll be back by Christmas
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:26:12] Back
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:26:19] Merry Christmas all!
* bgs100 [Jun 22 21:26:31] gives pedro3005 the gift of a bonk on the head
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 21:26:42] :P
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:27:21] Okay
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:27:27] char string[21];
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:28:00] printf("ENTER THE SUPER SECRET PASSWORD OR BE EXTERMINATED! ");
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:28:34] scanf("%s", &string);
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:29:04] if (strcmp(string, "happychristmas") == 0) {
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:30:00] puts("CORRECT. YOU MAY NOW LIVE SO YEAH ANYWAY.");
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:30:10] } else {
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:30:29] puts("EXTERMINATE! EXTERMINATE!");
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:30:30] }
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:30:45] sorry for being kind of slow.
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 21:30:52] no problem
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:31:02] So, that's strcmp
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:31:26] Hmm
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 21:32:04] doesn't C have classes?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 21:32:25] that's probably structs
* pedro3005 [Jun 22 21:32:30] fails
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:33:36] Yes, pedro3005 does
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 21:33:57] :(
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:34:11] :p
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:34:13] Well
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:35:34] You know, I'm not going to go through every single function in the standard library...
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:35:53] I suggest this:
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 21:35:54] bgs100, is it or is it not?
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:36:07] What?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 21:36:11] classes
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:36:15] ...
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:36:26] No, C does not have "classes"
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:36:32] Anyway
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:36:50] For learning about the standard library, I suggest this:
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:37:01] Looking through this page: http://www.utas.edu.au/infosys/info/documentation/C/CStdLib.html
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:37:06] And
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:38:06] For more of an in-depth description of a function (usually), related functions, and sometimes examples of usage or implementation, I suggest consulting manpages:
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:38:16] By running: man <name of function>
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 21:38:18] bgs100, oh, so that's what stdlib means?
<Snova>	[Jun 22 21:38:18] pedro3005: no
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:38:26] If that function happens to also be a command
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 21:38:43] Snova, ... quick answer huh
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 21:38:46] 1 second later
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 21:38:48] :P
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:39:09] pedro3005, stdlib does stand for standard library, but stdlib.h does not mean the whole library or any such thing
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:39:26] Also
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 21:39:31] so why is it called stdlib.h? they were running out of names?
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:39:41] Uh sure we can go with that :p
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:39:45] *shrugs*
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:39:56] pedro3005, stdlib.h is utility functions
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 21:40:24] ok
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:40:29] Perhaps named because it was more in general than the other parts of the standard library
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:40:34] Anyway
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:41:34] If a function happens to have the same name as a command, I suggest trying the 3rd part of manpages: man 3 <functionname>
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:41:37] Okay?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 21:41:51] okay
<seidos>	[Jun 22 21:42:27] okay
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:42:33] I think that the final parts of this class will be taking questions, giving examples, and assigning, uh, assignments.
<seidos>	[Jun 22 21:42:34] so now we're on our own
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:42:39] seidos, No.
<seidos>	[Jun 22 21:42:39] here are the resources for learning
<seidos>	[Jun 22 21:42:41] go read
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:42:50] :P
<seidos>	[Jun 22 21:42:51] and implement some of these tools
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:43:02] seidos, Class isn't over yet.
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:43:05] :p
<seidos>	[Jun 22 21:43:08] oh
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:43:20] There will be a few more
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:43:38] Asking you guys if you have questions or want to go over something again
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:43:49] Maybe a dip into 3rd party libraries
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:43:56] Assignments.
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 21:44:01] I'd think we'd benefit from exercising
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:44:11] Yes, thus "Assignments" :p
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:44:24] ...I should probably think of some beforehand
* seidos [Jun 22 21:44:36] can't wait until he's graduated from "assignments" to "projects"
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 21:44:50] bgs100, maybe the UF beginner challenges?
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:44:50] BTW, about manpages
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:45:04] Yes!
* bgs100 [Jun 22 21:45:10] gives pedro3005 star
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:45:12] In fact
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:45:20] I shall link to those next class
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:45:25] or this class
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:45:28] :p
<Snova>	[Jun 22 21:45:41] seidos: it's coming up with stuff to write that's hard
<seidos>	[Jun 22 21:46:02] hopefully I can do it
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 21:46:04] Snova, well, the hardest part is coming up with how to write it
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:46:10] You can ask me questions about doing things for those, sending me your code that doesn't work/works, etc.
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:46:18] And Snova too, methinks
* bgs100 [Jun 22 21:46:39] volunteers Snova :p
<Snova>	[Jun 22 21:46:43] "sending my your code that works" nothing odder than code that works when it shouldn't, eh?
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:46:50] Lol
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:46:59] I meant just to inspect a nice working product :P
<Snova>	[Jun 22 21:47:10] I realized that shortly too late :p
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:47:11] But that too, I suppose
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 21:47:14] "You are not advanced enough to produce working code! *slaps with ruler*"
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:47:16] Ha
* bgs100 [Jun 22 21:47:27] slaps pedro3005 with meterstick
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:47:45] This is a multi-nation/timezone ordeal! :p
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 21:47:59] bgs100, do we get bonuses for using 'goto' in every code we write?
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:48:07] pedro3005, Yes!
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:48:13] I will send you a nice present
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:48:19] A hungy raptor.
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:48:21] hungry*
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:49:02] Anyway
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:49:41] So yes, I suggest you try things on your own now, read about things, etc., and use the following lessons as a resource for help and additional learning.
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:50:05] Instead of my lesson plan, it will now be more of *your* lesson plan.
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:50:11] Okay?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 21:50:15] okay
* pedro3005 [Jun 22 21:50:20] shakes bgs100's hand
* bgs100 [Jun 22 21:50:31] hands pedro3005 a diploma
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:50:44] :P
* pedro3005 [Jun 22 21:50:50] frames and hangs it on a wall
* bgs100 [Jun 22 21:51:17] says "Good work, pedro. Good work."
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:51:20] :P
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:51:25] Oh and seidos too :D
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 21:51:28] bgs100, okay, now Lisp
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 21:51:30] :P
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:51:32] YAY
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:51:51] ============ The History of Lisp ============
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:51:53] :P
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:52:01] But anyway
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:52:13] pedro3005, seidos Do you currently have any questions vaguely related to C? :P
<seidos>	[Jun 22 21:52:25] what language is firefox written in?
<seidos>	[Jun 22 21:52:44] I asked in #firefox, but they told me to do a google search
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:52:49] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:52:56] Written in 	C++, JavaScript,[3]  CSS,[4][5]  XUL, XBL
<seidos>	[Jun 22 21:52:56] and the question is *vaguely* related to C
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:53:31] seidos, That's probably why they told you to search :P
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 21:53:32] bgs100, how different is C++ from C?
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:53:37] pedro3005, Hmm
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:53:39] Well
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:53:50] C++ has a lot of extra stuff
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:54:11] Classes, Templates, The STL, and such
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:54:27] They are close enough that you can use the C standard library in C++
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:54:37] Lots of valid C code is also valid C++
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:54:56] However, C++ does have a slightly stricter type system, so not all C code is valid C++.
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:55:35] g++ (C++ compiler) is part of gcc
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 21:55:48] alright
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:56:00] The STL really does add some nice classes
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 21:56:06] let me start the beginner's challenges then
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:56:11] Like strings, which you can add to each with +/+=
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:56:22] Er, a string class
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:56:26] pedro3005, Okay
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:56:37] pedro3005, Would you paste the link here?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 21:56:44] http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=5499486
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 21:56:47] this has _some_ of them
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 21:56:49] but not all
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 21:57:00] the others you'll have to search for it because I am very lazy
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:57:03] Yeah, some more were later created
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 21:58:15] 2 looks interesting
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:58:53] Also
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:58:55] pedro3005, seidos
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:59:04] Some functions I suggest you look up:
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:59:06] fgets
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:59:10] ungetc
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:59:12] sscanf
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:59:14] sprintf
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 21:59:22] bgs100, oohhh yeah.. what about sockets?
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 21:59:42] *whistles*
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:00:04] thought you were getting away with it, huh!
<seidos>	[Jun 22 22:00:09] was that a "walking away whistle", or a "woooow, that's big" whistle?
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:00:11] Those header files aren't part of the standard library
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:00:19] seidos, walking away
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:00:27] Those header files aren't part of the standard library, so I don't have to teach them! :P
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:00:41] But, honestly
<seidos>	[Jun 22 22:00:51] you don't have to teach anything, for which I am grateful
<seidos>	[Jun 22 22:01:04] er, that is, I am grateful that you are taking your time to teach us
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:01:08] I would suggest:
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:01:09] http://www.linuxhowtos.org/C_C++/socket.htm
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:01:12] seidos, Lol
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:01:22] You can come to me with any questions
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:01:38] There are man pages for the socket-related functions
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:01:44] as well.
<seidos>	[Jun 22 22:01:49] oh good god
<seidos>	[Jun 22 22:01:52] what did I get myself into?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:02:00] holy f***
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:02:26] .....
<seidos>	[Jun 22 22:02:30] it's like <God voice> The client server model </God voice>
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:02:45] LOL
* seidos [Jun 22 22:03:05] cowers from *The client server model*
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:03:12] Well, admittedly, "C_C" was in the URL
<Snova>	[Jun 22 22:03:22] the socket interface more or less comes down to; socket(), connect(), write()
<seidos>	[Jun 22 22:03:24] okay, that's enough cowering, better start reading
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:03:27] ... who needs sockets anyway
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:03:36] :P
<Snova>	[Jun 22 22:03:41] it's "complicated" to get around language limitations
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:05:51] bgs100, I keep forgetting things
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:05:56] :|
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:06:05] pedro3005, Quick, where are your car keys?
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:06:06] :p
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:07:43] nowhere
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:07:46] I don't have a car
<Snova>	[Jun 22 22:08:20] you lost that too?
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:08:23] Well, good, at least you remember were those are.
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:08:26] where*
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:08:34] Hahaha
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:09:04] Snova, :P
* bgs100 [Jun 22 22:09:44] gives Snova humo[u]r badge
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:09:54] er
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:09:58] yeah
* bgs100 [Jun 22 22:10:07] has unilimited badge supply
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:10:11] unlimited*
* bgs100 [Jun 22 22:10:24] gives self the keyboard failure badge
<seidos>	[Jun 22 22:11:32] I forget things && I have a difficult time understanding things
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:11:45] *shrugs*
<seidos>	[Jun 22 22:11:47] <C3PO voice> I'm doomed </C3PO voice>
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:11:54] bgs100, I don't know how to use scanf anymore
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:11:55] :P
* bgs100 [Jun 22 22:11:55] teaches seidos how to fix that
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:11:59] Ohwait
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:12:03] That might not work
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:12:12] *dad da dum*
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:12:17] pedro3005, :|
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:12:22] pedro3005, Seriously?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:12:26] bgs100, not really
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:12:33] Oh, good
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:12:35] to use it to get things like a name, we should use strings?
<seidos>	[Jun 22 22:12:38] I think I still remember scanf
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:12:46] Oh
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:12:54] i remember we used ints to get characters anyway
<seidos>	[Jun 22 22:12:54] now sscanf, different story
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:13:00] pedro3005, scanf isn't good for all input.
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:13:05] seidos, man sscanf
<seidos>	[Jun 22 22:13:05] server.c doesn't really make sense
<seidos>	[Jun 22 22:13:07] ah ha!
<seidos>	[Jun 22 22:13:10] I'm going to compile it
<seidos>	[Jun 22 22:13:22] right-o gotta' "man up"
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:13:31] xD
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:13:38] Was that pun intended?
<seidos>	[Jun 22 22:13:45] indeed
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:14:34] pedro3005, e.g. the %s directive gets a string up to a whitespace. You can't easily use it to get, for instance, a line of text
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:14:37] okay, i'll use strings
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:14:41] Did you look up fgets? :P
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:14:48] no :p
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:14:54] Well do that :|
* bgs100 [Jun 22 22:15:21] ssh's into pedro3005's computer and pipes man fgets | wall
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:15:37] hey why won't this work?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:15:40] char *name[];
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:15:41] What
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:15:45] ...
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:16:09] pedro3005, because if you don't give it a value at declaration you can't use []
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:16:18] oh
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:16:26] Also
<seidos>	[Jun 22 22:16:31] man, I bet the error catching code in firefox is awesome
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:16:34] Why do you want an array of char*'s?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:16:43] I don't know
<seidos>	[Jun 22 22:16:43] for the input at the URL box
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:16:55] pedro3005, :|
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:17:07] :P I need to grab a name as input
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:17:18] I'll just use getchar()
<seidos>	[Jun 22 22:17:32] why use getchar() instead of scanf()?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:18:43] damn, I wish I still had my getchar program
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:18:53] bgs100, I forgot  how to use getchar.... :p
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:19:04] .......
<seidos>	[Jun 22 22:19:06] I think I have mine somewhere
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:19:10] *sigh*
<seidos>	[Jun 22 22:19:13] I just don't know what I called it :o
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:19:17] pedro3005, What exactly are you trying to do?
<seidos>	[Jun 22 22:19:20] how do you search inside a file?  grep right?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:19:26] bgs100, challenge 2
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:19:29] seidos, mhm
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:20:36] pedro3005, scanf won't do well if you're trying to get a name that might have spaces... getchar() gets one individual char.
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:20:47] Just call it like so: getchar()
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:21:00] It will return EOF (-1) upon, well, EOF
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:21:15] pedro3005, Type this into your shell:
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:21:17] man fgets
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:21:19] Okay?
<seidos>	[Jun 22 22:21:27] pedro3005, I found this:  while ((c = getchar()) != EOF) {
<seidos>	[Jun 22 22:21:27]         putchar(toupper(c));
<seidos>	[Jun 22 22:21:27]         if (c == '!')
<seidos>	[Jun 22 22:21:27]             printf("!!!");
<seidos>	[Jun 22 22:21:27]     }
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:21:45] yeah but then I need to store this entire name
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:21:52] getchar() gets just one char
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:21:53] pedro3005, Yes...
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:21:58] If you wanted
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:22:07] You could build up into a char array.
<Snova>	[Jun 22 22:22:13] getline
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:22:14] And add the '\0' yourself.
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:22:49] bgs100, btw the name can't have spaces so scanf() might be good.. but I suppose it needs to detect the presence of spaces and complains
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:22:58] complain*
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:23:07] Snova, Although it isn't standard :P
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:23:11] argh I just want raw_input() :(
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:23:20] pedro3005, man fgets
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:23:25] I did that
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:23:29] ...and?
<seidos>	[Jun 22 22:23:46] pedro3005, are you working on the program challenges?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:23:54] I'll try to do it with fgets() then
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:23:56] seidos, yes
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:23:58] Wait
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:24:04] pedro3005, The name can't have spaces?
<seidos>	[Jun 22 22:24:05] I should do the same
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:24:10] Go ahead and try scanf.
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:24:20] See if it works.
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:24:35] so wait, a quick reminder.. should I do like
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:24:42] int name;
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:24:49] ...
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:24:51] No.
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:24:52] scanf("%d",&name);
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:25:07] Unless someone's name is "57"...
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:25:19] :P
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:25:52] waait
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:26:04] pedro3005, Where in the challenge does it say the name can't have spaces?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:26:29] oh wait
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:26:35] it can't _begin_ with spaces
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:26:37] failure
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:27:03] ....
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:27:06] Indeed.
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:27:28] and I thought this was hard on Python some months ago
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:28:10] pedro3005, Do something like:
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:28:14] char input[21];
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:28:25] fgets(input, 20, stdin);
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:28:46] bgs100, but then the input is limited :|
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:28:53] And I would uggest seeing if the last non '\0' character is a newline and if so replace it with '\0'
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:29:13] pedro3005, That's okay.
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:29:31] "To make this simpler, I will not enter a string bigger than 20 characters for valid data, but larger strings shouldn't cause problems. Truncate them.)"
<seidos>	[Jun 22 22:29:50] is -- an operator?
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:29:57] Yes
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:29:59] don't you mean fgets(input, 21, stdin) ?
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:30:02] The opposite of ++
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:30:06] pedro3005, No.
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:30:16] Errr
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:30:18] Yes :P
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:30:20]  fgets() reads in at most one less than size characters
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:30:25] yeah
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:30:28] bgs100, please do man fgets
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:30:29] :P
* bgs100 [Jun 22 22:30:31] gives pedro3005 the correct badge
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:30:37] pedro3005, Oh Har Har Har
* bgs100 [Jun 22 22:30:50] whacks pedro3005 with meterstick
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:31:01] er
* bgs100 [Jun 22 22:31:05] notices time
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:31:09] CLASS DISMISSED
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:31:10] bgs100, but wouldn't there be a way not to limit the input?
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:31:15] pedro3005, Yes
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:31:17] In fact
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:31:28] pedro3005, I was annoyed by exactly the same thing before.
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:31:38] How hard it was to get not-so-limited input
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:31:47] I ended up just writing a function :P
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:32:38] int fuck_scanf() {
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:33:00] because that's what I feel like
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:33:08] ...
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:33:26] I wrote this a while back, it may not be totally correct (pings Snova), but:
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:34:07] hey I could actually use goto in this
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:34:50] http://paste.pocoo.org/show/228775/
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:35:48] ugh
<Snova>	[Jun 22 22:36:01] eh?
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:36:04] getline() should be used similarly to raw_input() (without optional text to print)
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:36:24] Snova, Mind checking code I wrote a long time ago? :P
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:36:35] brb
<Snova>	[Jun 22 22:38:37] interesting
<Snova>	[Jun 22 22:39:23] it's fairly dense, but seems to work right
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:39:32] yaaay
<Snova>	[Jun 22 22:39:34] barring tricksy little off-by-one errors
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:43:11] gah
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:43:16] } while ((isspace(char[0])) || !(char[0]));
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:43:16] pedro3005, ?
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:43:19] er
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:43:19] why doesn
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:43:25] I mean
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:43:25] it work
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:43:32] I'll be taking questions next class :P
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:43:42] Snova? :p
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:43:50] Uh
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:43:54] I was kidding :|
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:44:02] oh
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:44:07] *sighs*
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:44:25] pedro3005, What is that } about?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:44:29] do while
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:44:44] Could I see the do? :P

<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:45:32] ...
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:45:34] what is char?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:45:49] hm?
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:46:04] You take it into input, then use "char"
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:46:12] ...
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:46:50] bgs100, oh failure
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:46:53] my god
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:46:56] how did I..
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:46:58] *facepalm*
<seidos>	[Jun 22 22:47:08] is there a way to put a text file into the paste buffer via the command line?
<seidos>	[Jun 22 22:47:16] like sample.txt > paste
<seidos>	[Jun 22 22:47:18] or something?
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:47:20] Paste buffer?
<seidos>	[Jun 22 22:47:29] copy buffer?
<seidos>	[Jun 22 22:47:34] frame buffer?
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:47:38] ...
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:47:39] bgs100, it works bitches!!!
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:47:41] :P
<seidos>	[Jun 22 22:47:45] I'm not sure what it's called
* bgs100 [Jun 22 22:47:48] slaps pedro3005 
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:48:07] pedro3005, Also, I am not plural :P
<seidos>	[Jun 22 22:48:17] why doesn't this loop go negative for(i=99; i>=0; i--)?
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:48:18] I AM THE COLLECTIVE
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:48:26] I was referring to the bitches in general
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:48:31] oh
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:48:36] I AM THE COLLECTIVE!
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:48:38] :P
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:48:51] seidos, Errr
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:48:54] bgs100, I excluded you out of niceness, be grateful
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:48:59] Are you sure it isn't?
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:49:11] pedro3005, *rolls eyes*
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:49:42] bgs100, you'll have to explain your code next class :p
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:49:49] :|
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:49:53] ...okay :P
* bgs100 [Jun 22 22:50:07] goes off to do other computer stuff
<seidos>	[Jun 22 22:50:30] pedro3005, can you see why my loop doesn't go negative so it will stop?
<seidos>	[Jun 22 22:50:45] if I set it >=1 it stops, but >=0 it just loops forever
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:51:04] hmmm
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:52:57] here it works
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:53:07] int main() {

<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:53:25] it prints 10 times
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:53:33] no more
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:53:35] no less
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:53:38] :p
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:54:47] hmm
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:54:54] seidos, is i a normal int?
<seidos>	[Jun 22 22:54:59] yeah
<seidos>	[Jun 22 22:55:01] int i;
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:55:04] hmm
<seidos>	[Jun 22 22:55:06] long int?
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:55:10] what are you doing in the loop?
<seidos>	[Jun 22 22:55:53] printf's

<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:56:54] seidos, ##philosophy gets quite... interesting
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:56:56] to say the least
<seidos>	[Jun 22 22:57:06] someone pm'ed earlier
<seidos>	[Jun 22 22:57:19] was trying to say that suffering is what humans crave
<seidos>	[Jun 22 22:57:30] because it gives them/us "individuality"
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:57:37] :|
<seidos>	[Jun 22 22:57:37] he said happiness was overrated
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:57:43] Uhhh
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:57:45] seidos,
<seidos>	[Jun 22 22:57:46] I said individuality is overrated
* seidos [Jun 22 22:57:51] hides
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:57:55] well that's okay
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:58:01] I think you want == in those if's
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:58:06] not ='s
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:58:10] Those assign i...
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:58:10] <Kjixill> i need to cut down on my masturbation habits
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:58:14] however..
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 22:58:15] :P
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:58:21] Not check if it is a value..
<seidos>	[Jun 22 22:58:31] yes.  that was an epic fail.
<seidos>	[Jun 22 22:58:49] thank you
<seidos>	[Jun 22 22:58:53] I do that to damn much
<seidos>	[Jun 22 22:59:00] s/to/too
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 22:59:07] :p
<seidos>	[Jun 22 22:59:51] no wonder I got a warning from the compiler :/
<seidos>	[Jun 22 23:00:03] man
<seidos>	[Jun 22 23:00:25] hindsight is miraculous
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 23:00:28] seidos, Pay attention to those
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 23:00:51] When you have a problem, paste the warnings (if there's only a few on IRC)
<seidos>	[Jun 22 23:00:55] I'll do my best
<bgs100>	[Jun 22 23:01:55] :)
<seidos>	[Jun 22 23:12:00] I don't get how can I take chars using scanf
<seidos>	[Jun 22 23:12:10] "%d" is for ints
<seidos>	[Jun 22 23:12:18] but I don't know what to use for chars
<seidos>	[Jun 22 23:12:25] man scanf doesn't seem to say
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 23:12:39] %c?
<seidos>	[Jun 22 23:13:27] I don't know, I still get some warnings
<pedro3005>	[Jun 22 23:13:40] me neither
<seidos>	[Jun 22 23:13:50] but I think that fixed some of them maybe
<seidos>	[Jun 22 23:16:18] I like this warning "comparison with string literal results in unspecified behavior
<seidos>	[Jun 22 23:16:19] "
<seidos>	[Jun 22 23:16:26] I mean, what is "unspecified behavior"?
<seidos>	[Jun 22 23:16:29] let's find out!
* seidos [Jun 22 23:16:33] executes binary
<seidos>	[Jun 22 23:17:01] it wouldn't execute :(
<seidos>	[Jun 22 23:18:07] compiling to a text file using > doesn't work to grab the warnings into a file
<seidos>	[Jun 22 23:18:40] ah, wasn't seeing an error
* seidos [Jun 22 23:18:56] facepalms himself *thwap*
<seidos>	[Jun 22 23:19:07] stdio.c?  no!  stdio.h
* seidos [Jun 22 23:19:19] bangs his head and chants "stupid, stupid, stupid"
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 00:51:52] Night
