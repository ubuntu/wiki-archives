=== Current Issues ===
1. (New to Gutsy) The new Screens and Graphics Utility seems not to work with the nvidia-settings tool. The Screens and Graphics utility does not properly configure dual displays, nor does it properly detect/configure the default screen. The nvidia-settings utility does work properly for setting up graphics, and does properly seem to detect the displays, but on reboot or X restart, all settings are lost.

2. (Issue exists in Feisty) Frequent system lockups while using Compiz/Desktop Effects (normal+). The lockups last only a few seconds at a time while under normal operation. CPU/GPU temps were monitored, and powernowd disabled to rule out any link to that issue, yet the problem occurred regardless. cat /var/log/messages revealed nothing to shed light on the issue.
