==== Details ====

 {*} Location: Barak Shrine Temple, Monroe, LA <<BR>>
 {*} April 25th: Setup Day  From 1 to 7 pm <<BR>>
 {*} April 26th: Hamfest  From 8am until midafternoon <<BR>>

We have requested tables 1, 2, and 14 of section C.  The floor plan can be viewed <nowiki>[[http://www.ares-nela.org/hamfest/Floorplan2008.gif|here]]</nowiki>.  Admission for our team members will cover our booth fees.   We have received a <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuAtConferences|LoCo Conference Pack]]</nowiki> (pack B for non-approved teams) from Canonical.  We received 300 fliers and 250 case badges from System76,  and we expect to receive a demo laptop on loan from them as well.

Currently, our plan is to have 2 laptops on each table.  One laptop will be showing a presentation, and the other will have either the liveCD up and running or be booted into a full Ubuntu install.

Amateur radio license testing will be offered at 9am for those interested. A testing fee of $14 applies. Since some of the LoCo members have shown interest in this, RobDeHart has put together <nowiki>[[http://somethingproductive.com/ham|this]]</nowiki> site to help people study.

==== Ideas ====

## Looping videos/screen-casts
## DVD-Movie, Pirates of Silicon Valley, BBS Documentary?
## <nowiki>[[http://www.elephantsdream.org/|Elephant's Dream]]</nowiki> Made entirely with open source software with all materials freely available.
## Application demos in screen cast (FIND SPECIFIC EXAMPLES)
## <nowiki>[[http://screencasts.ubuntu.com/|Ubuntu Screencasts]]</nowiki> these are being updated with subtitles also.  This would help with the need for having speakers/headphones with each laptop.

  1. CD of OSS Ham software for *nix and/or Windows(tm) (We don't want to leave people out and it still promotes OSS)
** Would this possibly fit on the normal Ubuntu cd?  How much free space is there?
** Considering the ISOs for Ubuntu are right at 700MB, not much; and I think it would be best for there to be separate disks, for people who already use other distros. We want to promote not only Ubuntu, but Linux in general as well.
  1. dzportwood - Have verizon ev-do card, PCMCIA mobile router with wifi (runs smoothwall linux), and 5 port small factor switch, can setup mobile internet access, spare cables might be a good idea, 2 laptops with wifi working, and accelerated gfx out of box. (MBP, Dell D630) also have 60 Ubuntu CDs all Gutsy (Desktop 32/64bit, small amount of Server 32/64bit).
