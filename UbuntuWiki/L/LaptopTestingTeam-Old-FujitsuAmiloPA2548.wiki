=== Current Issues ===
Built-in webcam doesn't work. Suspend and hibernate don't work (x-server goes down and command line environment freezes.)
Wireless is not working out-of-a-box, I had to use following instructions: http://www.ubuntugeek.com/atheros-5007eg-with-madwifi-on-i386-platform.html

I had some problems trying to get proprietary nvidia drivers running by hand. After using Envy I've had no problems with the drivers.

My kernel version is 2.6.24-19-generic.
