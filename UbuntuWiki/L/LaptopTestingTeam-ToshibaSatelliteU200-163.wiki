==== Notes ====

(1) With a straight Edgy, sound will be very very low and will play on both speakers and headphones. The trick is to create a file /etc/modprobe.d/sound-hackery which contains the line
<pre>
options snd-hda-intel model=hp
</pre>

(2) On feisty (or, on edgy, with (1) applied), sound will be perfectly functionnal except the mute/unmute key, which will only work for the headphone, not for the speaker.

(3) You simply need to install ThinkFinger (click for more instructions)

(4) To activate bluetooth, you have to press twice Fn+F8
