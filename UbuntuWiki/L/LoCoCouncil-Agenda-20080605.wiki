Syntux is interested in starting an ubuntu-arabic team. He has contacted others and many seem interested. As a next step, Syntux will write up a specification that the LoCoCouncil can look at. Syntux has requested a mailing list where people might discuss the creation of such a spec. The LoCoCouncil will try to get the mailing list.
