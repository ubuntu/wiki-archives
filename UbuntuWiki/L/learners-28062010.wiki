<pedro3005>	[Jun 28 19:50:51] bgs100, ping ping ping!
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 19:51:00] pong pong pong!
<pedro3005>	[Jun 28 19:51:11] me and seidos are here
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 19:51:18] hm
<seidos>	[Jun 28 19:52:03] hola
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 19:52:48] Oh crap
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 19:52:57] It seems I have to go :/
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 19:53:10] I will hopefully be back shortly...
<pedro3005>	[Jun 28 19:53:33] ok, take care
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 19:54:12] sorry :(
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 19:54:24] pedro3005, Thanks
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 19:54:25] bye
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 21:04:05] Back
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 21:04:08] pedro3005, seidos ?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 28 21:04:14] here
<seidos>	[Jun 28 21:04:21] present
<seidos>	[Jun 28 21:05:13] bgs100?
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 21:08:04] We didn't have class for the first time yesterday... I'm thinking about officially "ending" the class. Instead of asking questions in these last few dedicated "question classes", you can ask questions on other channels (after this class is replaced anyway :P) as beginners, not as students. What do you think?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 28 21:08:51] bgs100, oh, you are NOT getting away without teaching sockets :P
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 21:09:12] Not part of the standard library! Am not obligated!
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 21:09:14] :P
<seidos>	[Jun 28 21:13:15] I'm committed to getting the beginner problems done...
<seidos>	[Jun 28 21:13:24] so whether we have a class or not I should have stuff to do
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 21:13:32] Alright.
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 21:13:43] I think this will be the last class.
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 21:14:58] So.
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 21:15:09] What questions do you two have?
<seidos>	[Jun 28 21:16:02] pointers
<seidos>	[Jun 28 21:16:08] I understand that an array is a pointer
<seidos>	[Jun 28 21:16:37] but isn't it also NOT a pointer, since each element of an array is of type char?
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 21:17:08] No
<pedro3005>	[Jun 28 21:17:16] the whole is greater than the sum of parts ;P
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 21:17:18] It is a pointer to a char.
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 21:17:37] and then, one byte after that is the next char in the "array"
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 21:17:41] In fact
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 21:17:53] array[5] is the same as *(array + 5)
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 21:18:06] e.g. accessing 5 bytes past where array points.
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 21:18:23] array[0] is just *array
<seidos>	[Jun 28 21:19:26] I thought pointers pointed to addresses in memory
<seidos>	[Jun 28 21:19:30] not to other variables
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 21:19:47] ...
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 21:20:13] Pointers do not point to address (well, they can), their value is an address, like an int's value is an integer.
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 21:21:02] Pointers "point" (hold the address of) places in memory.
<pedro3005>	[Jun 28 21:22:28] one address = 1 bit?
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 21:22:41] What?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 28 21:22:59] how many addresses does one int take up?
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 21:23:08] err
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 21:23:18] It depends
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 21:23:26] The base "size" is one byte
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 21:23:34] sizeof returns the number of bytes
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 21:23:56] that something takes up
<pedro3005>	[Jun 28 21:24:36] I'm just not sure of what exactly is an "address"
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 21:25:11] A number that represents a place in memory.
<pedro3005>	[Jun 28 21:25:19] and how big is this place?
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 21:25:41] How "big" that place is depends on how many bytes were allocated or how many bytes the thing that's there takes up.
<pedro3005>	[Jun 28 21:25:55] ah
<pedro3005>	[Jun 28 21:26:02] so the size of an address varies
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 21:27:24] Well, how big the address is does not.
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 21:27:29] How big the space is does.
<pedro3005>	[Jun 28 21:27:47] so an address is also like a pointer
<pedro3005>	[Jun 28 21:27:53] it's pointers all the way down!
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 21:33:56] what
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 21:33:59] ...
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 21:34:06] pedro3005, What do you mean?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 28 21:34:23] bgs100, nevermind me
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 21:34:33] Okay then... :p
<seidos>	[Jun 28 21:34:45] maybe if I look at pointers as type address it will make more sense
<pedro3005>	[Jun 28 21:35:33] going to dinner, brb
<Snova>	[Jun 28 21:39:01] pedro3005: uh, a pointer *is* an address
<Snova>	[Jun 28 21:40:39] look, if I have 1gb of memory, that is roughly one billion bytes. the first byte in memory would thus have an address of zero. the billionth byte would be 1000000000. if you put that number into an integer and add a *, you get what is called a pointer
<Snova>	[Jun 28 21:41:11] the number 1000000000 is not important. its purpose is to that we can manipulate the billionth byte in memory, and no other
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 21:41:33] ohai
<Snova>	[Jun 28 21:41:48] oh hello
<pedro3005>	[Jun 28 22:11:37] bgs100, ok, so... the end?
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 22:11:53] sure, if everyone is ready.
* bgs100 [Jun 28 22:12:03] hands pedro3005 and seidos diplomas.
<pedro3005>	[Jun 28 22:12:08] :'(
* pedro3005 [Jun 28 22:12:53] gives bgs100 a Teacher badge
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 22:12:58] "Take all of your knowledge, expand it, and apply it. I expect great things out of you."
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 22:13:05] Thank you, pedro3005.
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 22:13:07] :)
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 22:13:26] Well then...
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 22:13:33] I suppose it is time...
<pedro3005>	[Jun 28 22:13:41] LISP
<pedro3005>	[Jun 28 22:13:42] :p
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 22:13:43] To throw your hats to the wind...
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 22:13:52] AND RRROOCKKK OOOUUTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
* bgs100 [Jun 28 22:13:55] rocks out
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 22:13:57] :P
* pedro3005 [Jun 28 22:14:12] throws hat to the wind
* bgs100 [Jun 28 22:14:29] retrieves the hat.
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 22:14:38] Oh look a free hat >.>
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 22:14:52] Well
<pedro3005>	[Jun 28 22:14:58] a-ha, it has a blade in it
<pedro3005>	[Jun 28 22:15:03] you are therefore CUT TO DEATH
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 22:15:08] I didn't put it on.
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 22:15:13] I just took it
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 22:15:19] Anyway
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 22:15:25] I must say goodbye to you, pedro3005 and sedios...
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 22:15:28] As students...
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 22:15:32] Farewell.
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 22:15:47] --- Official End of Class ---
<pedro3005>	[Jun 28 22:16:03] bgs100, you wish man. it'll be long before you get rid of our pings
<pedro3005>	[Jun 28 22:16:04] >:)
* bgs100 [Jun 28 22:16:05] cuts convientently placed ribbon with novelty scissors
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 22:16:17] pedro3005, I said as students >_>
<pedro3005>	[Jun 28 22:16:28] nevertheless
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 22:16:31] *cough* /ignore pedro3005 */cough*
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 22:16:35] just kidding :P
* pedro3005 [Jun 28 22:16:52] goes off into the night
<pedro3005>	[Jun 28 22:17:00] farewell day-dwellers
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 22:17:00] Godspeed, pedro3005
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 22:17:01] :P
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 22:17:18] pedro3005, What time is it where you are?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 28 22:17:26] 23:13
<pedro3005>	[Jun 28 22:17:32] and with that I leave
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 22:17:33] Also, need to talk to mohi1 about that Lisp class... :P
* bgs100 [Jun 28 22:17:46] waves bye at pedro3005 
<duanedesign>	[Jun 28 23:02:24] bgs100: ever put a terminal into a python program?
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 23:02:34] hm?
<duanedesign>	[Jun 28 23:03:56] i have
<duanedesign>	[Jun 28 23:03:57] http://people.ubuntu.com/~duanedesign/clicomp.SS.4.png
<duanedesign>	[Jun 28 23:04:28] but when i hit the 'run command' button it outputs to the terminal that launched the app
<duanedesign>	[Jun 28 23:04:32] :P
<seidos>	[Jun 28 23:04:34] duanedesign, cool
<seidos>	[Jun 28 23:04:41] what does cli companion do?
<seidos>	[Jun 28 23:05:03] ohhhh command line interface companion
<duanedesign>	[Jun 28 23:05:09] seidos: i started it as a way to help people learn the command line
<seidos>	[Jun 28 23:05:20] that's brilliant!
<seidos>	[Jun 28 23:05:26] why didn't I think of that?
<duanedesign>	[Jun 28 23:05:34] seidos: but i am going to make it a 'command dictionary' as well
<duanedesign>	[Jun 28 23:05:55] so it will come with a couple dozen commands and you can then add your own
<seidos>	[Jun 28 23:06:02] well, even if I did think of it I couldn't have implemented it
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 23:06:02] Neat. But no, I've never done that... hm...
<duanedesign>	[Jun 28 23:06:13] bgs100: me neither :)
<seidos>	[Jun 28 23:06:19] adding your own, that's cool
<seidos>	[Jun 28 23:06:53] duanedesign, I noticed a typo: scan Scan Wireless networks
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 23:07:06] duanedesign, Are you using pygtk, or what?
<duanedesign>	[Jun 28 23:07:30] bgs100: yes
<seidos>	[Jun 28 23:07:34] duanedesign, can I see your source code?
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 23:09:05] duanedesign, How did you make the terminal output widget in the window, anyway?
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 23:09:12] vte?
<duanedesign>	[Jun 28 23:11:23] http://people.ubuntu.com/~duanedesign/clicompanion/clicompanion.0.6.2.py
<duanedesign>	[Jun 28 23:11:39] yes vte
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 23:13:18] And you are currently doing:
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 23:13:19]         os.system(a)
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 23:13:20] ?
<duanedesign>	[Jun 28 23:14:02] bgs100: yes
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 23:14:12] Okay, one sec
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 23:17:04] Alright
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 23:18:10] duanedesign, Make v class wide and then in run_command replace os.system(a) with self.v.feed_child(a), or a + '\n' if you actually want it to execute instead of just being added to the prompt.
* duanedesign [Jun 28 23:19:33] nods
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 23:19:47] :)
<seidos>	[Jun 28 23:20:07] wow, it's not that many lines
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 23:22:04] That is because Python runs on disinfected magic.
<seidos>	[Jun 28 23:23:33] I thin I made it freeze
<seidos>	[Jun 28 23:23:37] s/thin/think
<seidos>	[Jun 28 23:23:42] maybe it's my system though
<duanedesign>	[Jun 28 23:27:43] i had an ncurses version i was working on
<duanedesign>	[Jun 28 23:28:08] not much  python documentation for ncurses
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 23:30:24] Really? There's an "official" page of documentation.
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 23:30:35] http://docs.python.org/library/curses.html
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 23:31:12] Man... every time a search result brings up haskell related stuff, it makes me want to mess with Haskell again... :(
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 23:31:49] Hah, there's better docs for Haskell's VTE bindings than for the actual thing :P
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 23:31:53] http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/vte/0.11.0/doc/html/Graphics-UI-Gtk-Vte-Vte.html
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 23:45:12] Ohai mohi1
<duanedesign>	[Jun 28 23:45:15] bgs100: success \o/
<duanedesign>	[Jun 28 23:45:20] thank you!
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 23:45:22] duanedesign, \o/ :D
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 23:45:24] np
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 23:45:31] Just took a bit of googling :P
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 23:51:42] duanedesign, BTW,
<bgs100>	[Jun 28 23:51:46] ever seen http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=380978 ?
* duanedesign [Jun 29 00:00:53] looking
<mohi1>	[Jun 29 00:02:10] heya bgs100
<duanedesign>	[Jun 29 00:02:28] bgs100: thats pretty neat wil have to look at that
<bgs100>	[Jun 29 00:02:34] mohi1, Hey, I've officially ended the C class.
<bgs100>	[Jun 29 00:02:44] duanedesign, :)
<mohi1>	[Jun 29 00:02:59] bgs100, no classes for yesterday right?
<bgs100>	[Jun 29 00:03:10] No
<bgs100>	[Jun 29 00:03:14] Today there was
<duanedesign>	[Jun 29 00:03:52] oh and thanks for the C classes. I have been lurking, and reading logs.
<mohi1>	[Jun 29 00:04:27] ok
<bgs100>	[Jun 29 00:05:25] duanedesign, Ah, you're welcome :)
* bgs100 [Jun 29 00:05:48] gives duanedesign the Very Quiet Student badge
<bgs100>	[Jun 29 00:05:50] :p
<bgs100>	[Jun 29 00:07:21] I've been thinking about a Common Lisp or Python class, as well.
<duanedesign>	[Jun 29 00:08:19] both would be neat
<duanedesign>	[Jun 29 00:08:38] i like emacs so lisp is something i have always wanted to learn
<bgs100>	[Jun 29 00:09:14] Ah, nice.
<bgs100>	[Jun 29 00:09:15] Also
<bgs100>	[Jun 29 00:09:33] There's a very popular and very nice Common Lisp environment for Emacs called SLIME
<duanedesign>	[Jun 29 00:10:02] i read this blog occasionaly http://lispgamesdev.blogspot.com/
<bgs100>	[Jun 29 00:10:12] It's what I use most often when doing stuff with Lisp.
<bgs100>	[Jun 29 00:10:32] duanedesign, Ah, yes (/me recognizes that blog)
<bgs100>	[Jun 29 00:11:40] brb
<duanedesign>	[Jun 29 00:11:45] i found him from this game he made. http://dto.github.com/notebook/xiotank.html
<bgs100>	[Jun 29 00:14:51] duanedesign, Lol, that's how I found him.
<bgs100>	[Jun 29 00:15:16] From the 7-day rougelike challenge
<duanedesign>	[Jun 29 00:15:30] bgs100: you might be where i got the link
<bgs100>	[Jun 29 00:15:39] Huh.
<duanedesign>	[Jun 29 00:17:31] have a good local_time()
<duanedesign>	[Jun 29 00:18:04] been hacking away all day. Need to stay away from the computer tommorrow and get some work done :)
<duanedesign>	[Jun 29 00:18:23] by all
<bgs100>	[Jun 29 00:18:28] Ah, heh. Bye duanedesign
<duanedesign>	[Jun 29 00:18:34] bye*
<bgs100>	[Jun 29 00:22:50] night
<seidos>	[Jun 29 00:38:49] Hey Snova, if you're around, what's the difference between | and ||?  I know one is "bitwise", but which is logical and which is bitwise?
<Snova>	[Jun 29 00:43:56] seidos: || is logical or; it compares two values for truthness and returns true if either one is also true
<Snova>	[Jun 29 00:44:29] | is a bitwise or, which combines two bytes by looking at their individual bits- where either of the two bits it looks at are 1, the bit in the resulting byte is 1
<seidos>	[Jun 29 00:46:17] Snova, all right, thanks
<seidos>	[Jun 30 00:28:17] Hey Snova, what is the purpose of stdin in gets(array, 5, stdin)?
<Snova>	[Jun 30 00:34:49] perhaps you mean fgets? gets() only takes one argument; also, gets() is the one you should never ever use
* seidos [Jun 30 00:36:43] checks his code
<seidos>	[Jun 30 00:37:30] yeah fgets
<seidos>	[Jun 30 00:38:02] I started off using fgets, and dropped the f while I was working on the last input code
<seidos>	[Jun 30 00:38:11] no wonder I couldn't find anything on google
<Snova>	[Jun 30 00:38:12] the reason it's there is because fgets() operates on any file stream
* seidos [Jun 30 00:38:17] checks google
<seidos>	[Jun 30 00:38:29] I'm just trying to figure out a way to remember stdin
<seidos>	[Jun 30 00:38:51] without some relational neural connections, I don't think I'll remember it
<seidos>	[Jun 30 00:39:09] my memory doesn't like memorizing seemingly unexplained facts
<seidos>	[Jun 30 00:39:42] well, I guess I can always go back and look at my code, if I use it enough, maybe I'll remember it
<seidos>	[Jun 30 00:39:46] Snova, thanks
<Snova>	[Jun 30 00:40:08] "remember stdin"? stdin = standard input
<Snova>	[Jun 30 00:40:30] there's three standard streams in most programs; stdin, stdout, and stderr- input, output, and output for errors
<seidos>	[Jun 30 00:41:08] what about scanf(), why doesn't it use these 3 standard streams?
<Snova>	[Jun 30 00:41:52] scanf() is simply a fscanf() that defaults to stdin
<Snova>	[Jun 30 00:42:24] there's a lot of such functions; purely for convenience. as you might expect, there is also an fprintf(), among several other variations
<seidos>	[Jun 30 00:43:50] ah, so they're defaulted
<seidos>	[Jun 30 00:44:02] that means I can use something other than stdin in fgets()?
<Snova>	[Jun 30 00:44:10] yes
<seidos>	[Jun 30 00:44:32] makes sense, all right, thank you
