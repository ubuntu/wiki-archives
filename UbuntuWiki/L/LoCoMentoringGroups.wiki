== LoCo Mentoring Groups ==

Setting up a LoCo team can be difficult process, and it can always be helpful to have help and assistance from other teams in your area. To help with this process, some teams have collaborated to form 'LoCo Mentoring Groups' which are combined members from LoCo teams that work to help new teams form in their area.

Another purpose of LoCo Mentoring Groups is to increase the number of teams in a particular part of the world. A good example of this is the ubuntu-usa mentoring project who are working to increase the number of state level LoCo teams in the United States.
