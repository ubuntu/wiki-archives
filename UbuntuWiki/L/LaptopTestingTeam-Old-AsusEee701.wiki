==== General Comments ====

=== Live ===
See hardware and software comments.

=== Installation from USB CD-ROM or HDD ===
* You should be able to use unetbootin to use a USB HDD.
* The method I prefer is to dd if=/iso/isoimage.iso of=/dev/usbhdd
* USB CD-ROM should work as well if the image is burned. BIOS is fairly new age.

* It is reccomended that a swap partition not be used, it will cook the drive.
* Without a swap partition hibernate will not function.
