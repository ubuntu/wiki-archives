==== Notes ====
1. Works amazingly well, I'm quite impressed. I'd tested hoary on one of the HP laptops that they were releasing ubuntu with and it pales in comparison to this.

Everything works mostly well. XGL even works in Dapper!

2. In my case, 3D acceleration is working in edgy, so I think this is not a problem now.

3. In my case, in edgy or feisty, I can use external monitor, but the default x.org configuration will make the clone mode work abnormal-the laptop display normal, the external monitor blinking. So I must specify the clone mode in xorg.conf to avoid this problem when I want to use the clone mode. And the extend desktop can work nicely with Xinerama.
