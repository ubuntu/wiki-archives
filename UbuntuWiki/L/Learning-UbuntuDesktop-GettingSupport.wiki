== Helping And Getting Help In The Community ==

Whether you need help, want to give help, or make new friends, the Ubuntu community is a great place, where you can contribute, and help millions of users.

=== IRC ===

The Internet Relay Chat (IRC) network that Ubuntu uses is freenode (irc.freenode.net, port 6669). If you need more information about IRC, please <nowiki>[[Learning-UbuntuDesktop-IRC | click here to access the IRC basics manual]]</nowiki>. Our core channels are:

* #ubuntu, for general support questions.
* #ubuntu-devel, for development issues. (Please, don't ask support questions here, as you will not get an answer, and will be redirected to #ubuntu)
* #ubuntu-offtopic, for offtopic discussions.

You can replace ubuntu for any of its flavors to get into the support channel for the specific flavor. Please, remember to check our IRC Guidelines here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/IRC/Guidelines. To check a complete Ubuntu channels list, go to <nowiki>[[IRC-ChannelList]]</nowiki>.

=== Launchpad ===

Launchpad is a web platform, where projects like Ubuntu are hosted. To ask a general support question about Ubuntu, please go to <nowiki>[[https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu | Launchpad Answers for Ubuntu]]</nowiki> and click "Ask a question". If you want to answer question, just look for one that you think you can answer, and give a response, or ask the user for more information about it. Obviously, to ask/answer questions, you will need to have a Launchpad account, which you can create easily with the Log In/Register link in the top right corner of the page.

=== Ask Ubuntu! ===

Ask Ubuntu! is a site where thousands of users ask an answer questions daily. You can ask what you need about Ubuntu over there, and you'll get an answer quickly. We have users all around the world helping us to maintain the site. You can login to Ask Ubuntu! with any StackExchange account, and start working with us.

Currently, there are lots of help articles. You can check them out in the <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com | Ubuntu Help page]]</nowiki>.
