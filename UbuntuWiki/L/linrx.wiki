__TOC__

When my paternal grandfather passed away, I wanted to visit the Malaysian town of Lipis where my father supposedly was born and where my paternal grandmother was once the daughter of a school principal before she married my paternal grandfather that came to operate a bicycle shop as a proprietor in Singapore. Today Lipis still stands, and with Google Maps Street View I can effectively visit those streets and buildings that my father may have known of, including the hospital where he was born from. In as far as my ancestors came to Malaysia during the rubber economic boom, my generation and I only know of the computing balloon bust, so while our ancestors tried making a healthy profit from repairing bicycles before and after the world wars, in the digital age these days we do without repairing computers and profits and all we speak of is how to abstain and / or prevent wars while ensuring minimal losses.
