=== Current Issues ===

From the IntrepidReleaseNotes:

The version of the <code>iwlagn</code> wireless driver for Intel 4965 wireless chipsets included in Linux kernel version 2.6.27 causes kernel panics when used with 802.11n or 802.11g networks.  Users affected by this issue can install the <code>linux-backports-modules-intrepid</code> package, to install a newer version of this driver that corrects the bug.  (Because the known fix requires a new version of the driver, it is not expected to be possible to include this fix in the main kernel package.)
