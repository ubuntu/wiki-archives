=== Your Name ===

Email: 
My name is Leo Truksans (Leo Trukšāns). I am a lecturer at the <nowiki>[[http://www.lu.lv|University of Latvia]]</nowiki>. I teach Linux administration and CCNA networking here. I lead <nowiki>[[http://linux.edu.lv|Linux Center]]</nowiki> of the University of Latvia and am involved in most of it's activities.

==== Linux Center ====

One of the main goals of the Linux Center is to promote open source software as a wide collection of accessible and convinient tools for everyone. As Ubuntu Linux fits very well into this vision, we support this distribution as our main user-oriented platform. We teach it's usage and administration to students and teachers, support a local Ubuntu comunity, <nowiki>[[http://linux.edu.lv/index.php?name=Forums|forum]]</nowiki> and popular seminar location in Latvia.
