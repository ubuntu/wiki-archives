=== Current Issues ===
* Sometimes the keyboard is dead upon boot when greeted by the GDM login screen. Rebooting helps.
* No matter what sound channel settings I choose, the microphone can just barely be heard.
* After some usage, the line-out stopped working. It does not anymore detect if something is plugged or not. This is not a hardware issue, since it works fine when booted into Windows.
* FIXED: add line ''options snd-hda-intel model=laptop position_fix=2'' at the end of /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base and reboot. The sound card should now work correctly fixind the issues mentioned above.
* on Gutsy the video driver 'intel' is used in stead of older 'i810'. There are some issues however.. best to remove package 'displayconfig-gtk' and do your confs manually in xorg.conf or with xrandr.

==== Notes ====
* To get correct 1280x800 resolution, install package '915resolution'.
* To get S-video out working, set device section in xorg.conf to:

 Section "Device"
        Identifier      "Intel Corporation Mobile 945GM/GMS/940GML Express Integrated Graphics Controller"
        Driver          "i810"
        BusID           "PCI:0:2:0"
        Option          "MonitorLayout" "TV,LFP+CRT"
        Option          "Clone" "true"
 EndSection

* You can use 'System > Settings > Screen resolution' to set resolution to 1024x768 so that the output image looks correct.
