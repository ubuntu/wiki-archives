=== Current Issues ===
* The wireless A/B/G card doesn't seem to work. Ubuntu recognizes it, and can even detects local ESSID's, but it can't seem to sync up with the basestation. I tried via the GUI, and even using iwconfig on the command line, but no joy.
** Some further research suggests this is has something to do with WPA support on the Intel 2200 series wireless chips. Does anyone out there have more info on that?
* I also have a Docking Station II. The USB ports on it don't seem to be recognized by Ubuntu (ie, mouse/keyboard on the dock, so I have to use the laptop's own USB ports for it). With the default "ati" driver, in order to get it to use the external monitor, I have to boot with the lid down. However, with the fglrx driver, it seems to be fine. It does use the docking station's Ethernet port, as well as A/C power.
* One very strange thing. Sometimes, the kernel apparently decides that the hard disk is actually hde instead of hda, and won't boot. Switching the kernel line in grub to "/dev/hde2" fixes this, but then the system will go back to thinking that it is hda at some point in the future. Very weird.
** ''Ahhhh, this may explain another issue I've seen.  When you do boot with `/dev/hdeN`, what do `hda` and `hdc` show up as?  Are they copies of the Serial ATA devices?  Please file a bug against `linux-source-2.6.15` with a title involving "IDE enumeration".'' -PaulSladen
** This is <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/bugs/6367|#6367]]</nowiki> ?
* [new] Sometimes when the system comes up, it doesnt get a dhcp address on the primary NIC. If I run dhclient on the command line, or "deactivate/activate" it via the gnome gui, it works fine. Only happens sometimes.

| Installation works?
| Untested
| Installation went fine, but the system wouldn't boot, complaining that it couldn't find /dev/hda2 (my /). This is the same issue as reported above, about it confusing /dev/hde with /dev/hda.
