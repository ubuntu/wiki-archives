__TOC__

I've been building sites since 1994 when Abril S/A hired me to retain and lead the team who eventually created Brasil Online (BOL), the first large-scale news portal and Internet access provider in Brasil. In 1998 I stumbled upon Python and then Zope, and since then I have been developing content management systems with them.

I was one of the founders and the technical lead at Hiperlógica (1999-2003), the first Brazilian company specializing in Zope. I am now a Plone, Zope and Python instructor and consultant at SimplesConsultoria.

I used to be a college dropout, but since 2004 I've been studying Library Sciences at the Universidade de São Paulo (USP), in São Paulo, Brazil. My goal is to learn and eventually contribute to the theory and practice of organizing information for human needs.
