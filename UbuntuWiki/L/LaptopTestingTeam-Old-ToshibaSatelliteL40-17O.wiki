==== Notes ====

To make the wireless card work:
Go to http://www.datanorth.net/~cuervo/rtl8187b/ and download rtl8187b-modified-dist.tar.gz 2.6.24.patch, compile and install the module:
* wget http://www.datanorth.net/~cuervo/rtl8187b/rtl8187b-modified-dist.tar.gz
* wget http://www.datanorth.net/~cuervo/rtl8187b/2.6.24.patch
* tar -xvzf rtl8187b-modified-dist.tar.gz
* cd rtl8187b-modified
* patch -p1 < ../2.6.24.patch
* ./makedrv
* sudo ./wlan0up
And the wireless card works(somewhat, see below). Add to /etc/init.d/ to make it work on reboot.
Need to recompile the module after every kernel upgrade.

The wireless card now works, but not in all conditions:
* without encryption: works
* using 64 bit WEP encryption and "network authentication: Open System": Works
* 128 bit WEP encryption does not work
* setting "network authentication: shared" (in the ubuntu wireless-authentication popup) freezes the PC. 
* The reporting of the link quality, link strength and noise level doesn't work (all are said to be 0). 
* After suspend the link comes up automatically (but it does take some time).
