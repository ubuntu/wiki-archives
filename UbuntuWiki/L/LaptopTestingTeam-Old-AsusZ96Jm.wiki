==== Notes ====
(1) See http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1699107&group_id=81433&atid=562934 on how to build new kernel module acpi4asus > 0.4 which than states it has registered the led:device asus:mail. 
Shall I post a bug report to get this into the distribution?
(2) When WiFi is disabled via Fn+F2 the WiFi LED does not act accordingly.
