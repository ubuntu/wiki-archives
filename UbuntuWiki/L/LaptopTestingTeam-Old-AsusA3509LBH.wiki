__TOC__

* Contact: WitWilinski 
* Make: ASUS
* Model: A3L (A3509LBH)
* WARNING: This description is still incomplete

=== Current Issues ===
* The Celeron M processor needs p4-clockmod module for speedstepping - not natively supported by powernowd, needs scripts modifications (PaulSladen: p4-clockmod is deprecated.  Scaling is not enabled on the P4-desktop chips because it doesn't actually save any power.  The throttling is just there stop the chip melting under load;  a large latency is introduced when the chip switches between throttle-levels and this is preferable to avoid).
* IRDA doesn't work at all (irdadump shows only the computer)
* The internal PCMCIA card reader is a passive one - not supported by Linux
* Software suspend: 3D accelleration doesn't work after resume
* Laptop mode is totally untuned for any usage - watching a movie is impossible, had to modify some ACPI events
* Switching to an external display is near-to-impossible. The only thing that's possible to achieve is enabling external display with laptop's LCD disabled (needs editing of xorg.conf and server restart)
* synaptics driver doesnt work correctly (no extended functions) if psmouse is a kernel module. Works good with psmouse built into the kernel
* the soundcard module is generating a lot of kernel messages (not corrected since 2.6.7, error in snd-intel8x0 only)
* no program for managing wireless connection. WiFi Radar could be installed by default
