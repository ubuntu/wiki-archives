==== Notes ====

This is a new installation and as such the information here will be added to as the relevant tests are applied.
I will be adding information about my configuration experiences for various hardware issues here as well as any resolutions I uncover.

Please add any issue resolutions from your own experience so all those who work with Ubuntu on this hardware platform in the future will have some guidance.

This is also an appropriate place to post hardware issues you discover so others will know about them and perhaps even resolve them.
