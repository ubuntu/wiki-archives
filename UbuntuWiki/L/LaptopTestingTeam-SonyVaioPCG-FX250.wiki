=== Current Issues ===
Splash screen during boot hasn't work since sometime between edgy knot 2 and knot 3. In Edgy, screen turns into a mess of garbled lines flickering for the duration of the boot. For Fiesty, screen just goes blank. Especially annoying is when errors halt the boot process. Hit Ctrl+Alt+F1 to look at the messages on another virtual console.
