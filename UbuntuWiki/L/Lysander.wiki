Lysander (formally known as Lachlan Cannard) is a university student currently residing in Como, Australia.

Lysander has been using Ubuntu since version 5.10, and although he knows a little C++, does not seem to have the ability to contribute anything else but bug reports. And he's not even very good at that.

Should you wish to contact Lysander, he can be found at the following MSN address: lysandermcgraw@gmail.com 

He does not respond to emails, as they are the tools of the devil.
