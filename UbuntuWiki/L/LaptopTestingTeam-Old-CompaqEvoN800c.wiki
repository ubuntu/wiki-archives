==== Notes ====
* Video occaisionally loses it when screen blanked.  Then get a interlaced/jittery image.  Only fix appears to be a reboot.  This has been seen on Fedora and Suse releases too. Interestingly enough same thing happens in windows , I'm guessing it's a hardware problem.
* Hibernate problem fixed
* Modem requires proprietary driver from http://www.linuxant.com :(
