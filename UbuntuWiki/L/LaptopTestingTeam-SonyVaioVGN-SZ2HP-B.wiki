==== Notes ====

This laptop has two Graphics Cards with a switch button: "stamina" for Intel Card and "speed" for nVidia Card. The only way that works right now in both Linux and Windows is to reboot the machine. Just when the BIOS is restarting, switch to the other Card.

I have two xorg.conf files with different driver section:

/etc/X11/xorg.conf.stamina
<pre>
Section "Device"
        Identifier      "Intel Corporation Mobile Integrated Graphics Controller"
        Driver          "i810"
        BusID           "PCI:0:2:0"
EndSection
</pre>

/etc/X11/xorg.conf.speed
<pre>
Section "Device"
        Identifier      "NVIDIA Corporation NVIDIA Default Card"
        Driver          "nvidia"
        BusID           "PCI:1:0:0"
EndSection
</pre>

and my rc.local script put the correct file at boot time, look like this:
<pre>

if [ "`/usr/bin/lspci|grep -c nVidia`" = "1" ]; then
        cp -f /etc/X11/xorg.conf.speed /etc/X11/xorg.conf
else
        cp -f /etc/X11/xorg.conf.stamina /etc/X11/xorg.conf
fi

exit 0
</pre>
