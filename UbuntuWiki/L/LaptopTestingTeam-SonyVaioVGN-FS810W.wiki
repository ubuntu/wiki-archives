__TOC__

* Brand: Sony
* Make : Vaio
* Model: VGN-FS810/W (PCG-7G2L)
* Website: http://esupport.sony.com/US/perl/model-home.pl?mdl=VGNFS810W&LOC=3

=== Current Issues ===
* Fn Keys - Most function keys do not currently work out of the box - The events are not even detected by xev (X system event viewer). Running a program called fsfn (not in repos, need to compile from source) - Found some similar bugs report, assigned this bug to a developer https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/hotkey-setup/+bug/50692
* Battery life is decent however it is not estimated properly by Gnome Power Manager, this causes annoying popus and unless default setting is changed it will cause unwanted shutdowns (due to thinking it is running on critical power) - this may be an issue with my specific battery, need to research.
* Memory Card reader is not working, it is detected as a tifm_7xx1. The device is only supposed to read Sony Memory Sticks, therefore it is of little interest to get working.
* Using the hardware wireless switch while the computer is on will not allow you to use the wireless once switched back on, generally have to modprobe for ath_pci and it will come back.

==== Feisty Notes ====
* Wireless does not work until you install generic modules:
<code>sudo apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-generic </code>

Then edit <code>/etc/modules</code> as root and add the line <code>ath_hal</code>. This will load the madwifi drivers at boot time.
* In order to get cpu scaling working, edit <code>/etc/modules</code> as root and add the line <code>p4-clockmod</code>. Scaling is supported from 187mhz to 1500mhz.
* In order to get software control of the brightness settings (dim laptop when on battery, use brightness applet):

Edit the following files:

Change the first line on both of these files
<pre>
/usr/lib/hal/scripts/linux/hal-system-lcd-get-brightness-linux
</pre>
and
<pre>
/usr/lib/hal/scripts/linux/hal-system-lcd-set-brightness-linux
</pre>
to read:
