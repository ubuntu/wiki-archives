==== Notes ====
* * 3D acceleration is enabled by using xorg-driver-fglrx but the resolution stuck at 1024x768. By using proprietary ATI driver v.3.0-8.18.6 the problem can be solved so the resolution is back at 1280x800
* ** Using external bluetooth dongle
* *** The key is working for decrease/increase the volume, but if you use it frequently, it will freeze your keyboard (you can't type anything in active window, but you can still do Ctrl+Alt+Backspace and Ctrl+Alt+F1)
* **** The external monitor must be connected before you turn on the laptop
