==== Notes ====
[1] Screen diagonal 13.4 inch, best resolution set at default 1280x800 dpi.
[2] The internal webcam works properly. It has been tested successfully by means of the Ekiga 2.0.x (Voip) videoconferencing function.
[3] Pressing the Fn and F9 buttons simultaneously will lock the touchpad. To re-enable the locked touchpad again, press those two buttons again. It is not a bug.
[4] The preferred order of the icons placed on the command panels, at the right side, changes into a mess when using an external monitor. This minor problem can be dealt afterward, though, by rearranging them manually.
WB: [1] Mouse not working after hibernating using USB port or USB/Sata port, but only since 2.6.28-15.
WB: [2] Fingerprint reader is recognized by software, further testing needed.
WB: [3] changing WiFi network: it's easier and faster to restart & choose new network instead.
