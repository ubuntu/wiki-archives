__TOC__

== LoCo Open Day ==

Go back to the main <nowiki>[[LoCoTeamsUDSMVSpecs]]</nowiki> page

Details coming soon.

== Brainstorm Section ==

/!\ Please add stuff here as you think of it. That's how brainstorming works! /!\

=== Activities ===

* general promoting of the channels around freenode

 (reason: many people in the main ubuntu channels are completely unaware of the LoCo channels/teams)

* promotion on the ubuntu forums

 (reason: many people have not ventured from the forums to the various LoCo channels/wiki/sites)

* promotion in other social networks

 (reason: if nothing else, we might end up with more ubuntu users B) )

* work on documentation (both wiki and team websites)

 (reason: it would be nice to have somewhere to point people, and it would be even nicer if that somewhere was full to the brim of useful info)

* physical meet-ups to get to know your fellow LoCo members, and invite the general public to come see Ubuntu

 (reason: many people still appreciate face-to-face contact)

=== Media ===

What media infiltration can we achieve? Who has contacts they can use?
