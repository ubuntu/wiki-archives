=== Current Issues ===
The Restricted driver for the onboard SmartLink modem interferes with the Intel sound chip driver (ALSA conflict?). Unloading the Restricted driver for the modem re-enables sound immediately. Either will work separately, but not reliably when installed at the same time.

==== Notes ====
(1) Sound chip driver conflicts with the currently available restricted driver for the onboard SmartLink modem. Modem driver must be uninstalled from the Restricted Driver manager in order to have reliable sound hardware detection on boot. If modem driver installed, sound may randomly disappear with device being shown as "Dummy Device". Unpredictable. Fixes with uninstall of modem driver.

(2) Extended Desktop was not usable in the default configuration in either VGA or S-Video. Desktop background disappeared, leaving a black screen with only the mouse cursor visible on both laptop display and TV. Cursor does travel between screens but desktop is not rendered viewable otherwise.

(3) External VGA and S-Video both work, but in mirror mode only. Must shut down, connect external display then reboot in order to display correctly in mirror mode. Attempting to hotplug either results in extended black screen as described in (2) above, with cursor only and no desktop, i.e. not usable.
