==== Notes ====
* I found the Hardy alpha performed quite a bit slower on my system than 7.10.  With visual effects enabled at the "normal" level, there is a VERY noticeable slowdown when scrolling in any application, especially Firefox.  Turning visual effects off altogether kills the slowdown completely.  In 7.10, I have a full-blown Compiz-fusion setup that is as responsive as Hardy with all visual effects off. 

* The external monitor did not work with hotplugging in both 7.10 and Hardy.  I had to restart the X server to get 'er going.  After that though, worked for the most part.  One little gotcha was the fact that I am testing with a 4:3 aspect monitor - On 7.10, the laptop resolution stays at 1280x800 and the monitor resolution becomes skewed.  On Hardy, the laptop resolution changes to 1280x1024 to fit the monitor.

* The side scrolling on my touchpad currently DOES work in 7.10- the thing is, I do recall having issues with it back in the day and I do recall installing/removing some packages that had to do with configuring the touchpad.  Therefore I am not 100% sure if the side-scrolling worked out of the box with 7.10.  Didn't work on Hardy Alpha 5, but as of now with Hardy Beta, it's good to go out of the box.
