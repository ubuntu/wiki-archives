__TOC__


This is a brief summary of bugs fixed between Ubuntu 10.04 and 10.04.1. '''This summary covers only changes to packages in ''__main__'' and ''__restricted__'', which account for all packages in the officially-supported CD images; there are further changes to various packages in ''universe'' and ''multiverse''.''' Some of these fixes were by Ubuntu developers directly, while others were by upstream developers and backported to Ubuntu. For full details, see the individual package changelogs.

In addition to the bugs listed below, this update includes all security updates from the <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/usn|Ubuntu Security Notice list]]</nowiki> affecting Ubuntu 10.04 LTS that were released up to and including August 09, 2010. The last updates included were USN-965-1 (OpenLDAP vulnerabilities).

=== Installation bugs ===

Updated CD images are provided with this release, including fixes for some installation bugs. (Many installation problems are hardware-specific; for those, see "Hardware support bugs" below.)
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| grub2
| Bug:580408
| Rearrange postinst install_devices logic so that preparatory code is run only once and the while loop only encloses actual asking of questions, and so that the question being asked is always marked for redisplay when going round the while loop again (LP: #580408).
|-
| grub2
| Bug:576724
| Only offer partitions containing /, /boot, or /boot/grub for grub-install; installing to other partitions may have harmful effects such as making Windows unbootable, and installing GRUB to every single partition is likely to result in confusion anyway (LP: #576724).
|-
| grub2
| Bug:508173
| When migrating from the old grub-pc/install_devices scheme, check if the old value indicated installation to a single partition on a single disk. In that case, if there is only one disk present and it has a matching partition number, then we can install to that partition without asking (LP: #508173).
|-
| installation-guide
| Bug:591199
| partman/confirm_write_new_label was renamed to partman-partitioning/confirm_write_new_label in r50363, December 2007. Adjust preseeding documentation to match (LP: #591199).
|-
| language-selector
| Bug:569442
| update fontconfig/69-language-selector-ja-jp.conf: change binding to 'strong' (LP: #569442)
|-
| migration-assistant
| Bug:536673
| unmount_os can be called without arguments (LP: #536673).
|-
| ubiquity
| Bug:549756
| Refactor default boot device calculation, bringing it into sync with grub-installer.  This should ensure that when installing to a removable device we always default to installing GRUB to that same device as well, while leaving the situation for installations to hard disks unchanged (LP: #549756).
|}

=== Upgrade bugs ===

These changes fix upgrade issues, smoothing the way for future upgrades to later releases of Ubuntu.

|-
| fglrx-installer

| Bug:574279
| add ubuntu-netbook-remix and ubuntu-netbook to valid meta-packages to ensure clean transition for the rename of ubuntu-netbook-remix to ubuntu-netbook (LP: #574279)
|-
| update-manager
| Bug:574279
| Check if the metapkg is actually upgradable. This covers the case of ubuntu-netbook-remix that may no longer be available to a user if "universe" is disabled (LP: #574279)
|-
| update-manager
| Bug:456468
| Add workaround for nm-applet dying during the upgrade. At the start up of the update we take it down in a controlled way (LP: #456468)

|}

=== Kernel and Hardware support bugs ===

Considerable work has been done in Ubuntu 10.04.1 on improving support for many specific items of hardware.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| acpi-support
| Bug:582471
| power.sh, lib/policy-funcs: don't call pm-powersave if upower is running, as upower already does this for us unconditionally and we don't want to run these scripts twice.  Eventually power.sh should be dropped entirely, but Kubuntu hasn't yet transitioned to use upower.  LP: #582471.
|-
| acpid
| Bug:570450
| debian/powerbtn.sh: ensure that /usr/share/acpi-support/power-funcs exists before sourcing it; note that acpid does not depend on acpi-support (which is fine, as it brings in lots of X dependencies not appropriate for servers); this fix will allow Ubuntu servers (especially those in VMs) to run acpid and catch and handle power button events again; LP: #570450
|-
| base-files
| Bug:610647
| debian/postinst.in: A bug in the build process for the Dell Latitude 2110 factory pre-installed OEM images caused a temporary apt configuration file to be left in the installed system. This disabled apt's enforcement of authenticated packages. Remove the file on upgrades if it matches the factory version. (LP: #610647)
|-
| cdrom-detect
| Bug:586036
| usb-storage sometimes seems to take a while to settle to the point of actually exposing block devices, despite the 'udevadm settle' in hw-detect.  I don't see an easy way to solve this, so, with reservations, retry the detection loop three times with a 'sleep 3' in between in the event that no devices are found, in the hope that that improves matters (LP: #586036).
|-
| hal
| Bug:546992
| Add 02_libhal_dont_check_running.patch: In libhal_ctx_init(), do not check if hal is already running, since it will get D-Bus activated. Thanks to Lionel Le Folgoc for the patch! (LP: #546992)
|-
| hal
| Bug:525245
| Add 00git_bigger_path_size.patch: Bump HAL_PATH_MAX to 4096. Patch taken from upstream git head. (LP: #525245)
|-
| libusb
| Bug:427805 Bug:595650
| 07_altsetting_alloc.patch: Update patch to only clear the current altsetting record in the loop, not overwrite previously written ones. Thanks to Pawel Kot! (LP: #427805, #595650)
|-
| libusb
| Bug:427805
| Add 07_altsetting_alloc.patch: Fix crash due to uninitialized memory. Thanks to Eric Miao for debugging this and the patch! (LP: #427805)

| Bug:539515
| Add 00git-fix-floppy-probing-hangs.patch: A lot of modern machines do not have a floppy drive any more, but still have a floppy controller somewhere (or at least the BIOS pretends to). Trying to open(/dev/fd0) on these machines causes long hangs, which lead to long desktop startup times. To fix this, avoid probing floppies for media in update_info(). nautilus/gvfs do not expect the media state to be correct for floppies anyway. (LP: #539515)
