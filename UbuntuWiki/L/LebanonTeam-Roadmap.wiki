=== Lebanon Team Roadmap ===
Below is the list of active & completed goals/projects. If you would like to propose a project or a goal, simply add it to "Our list" below. Unassigned projects can be claimed by any member. Projects can also be assigned to more than one member. However, before adding your name to an already assigned project you should speak with one of the existing assigners or with one of the leaders. This way, work will not be duplicated and conflicts in implementation will be prevented.
