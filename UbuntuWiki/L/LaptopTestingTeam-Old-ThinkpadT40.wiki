==== Notes ====
[1] Recently had one case where the machine didn't hibernate properly - sat there spinning the HD for 10 minutes after which I power cycled it. Happened when doing the FN+F12 to hibernate. First time in ~20 hibernates it has failed.

[2] After resume from hibernate, it is extremely confusing trying to get the card working again. Method to get interface working is to unload the 'airo' module, then reload it, bring up ACU, then run 'dhclient3' to grab an IP address (if using DHCP).  The cause of this bug is documented in bug 13850.

[3] When docked on the docking station, the image will come out of a connected monitor, but not on the laptop screen (tested once thus far - may be an anomoly).

[4] Backlight remains on.

[5] Must be enabled in the BIOS. See ThinkpadT40IrdaHowto for details of how to get it working with the FIR driver.

[6] Need to install irda-utils and modify default config. Tested using FIR as installed via ThinkpadT40IrdaHowto . Doesn't automatically resume operation after resume from hibernation.

[7] Blanks and locks the screen when FN-F3 is pressed. Backlight remains on.

==== Notes ====
[1]  can't find PCMCIA in KinfoCenter display which presumably means that it wasn't detected by Linux at startup. Note that PCMCIA is supported in Linspire 5.0.347 but apparently not Linspire 5.1.427, Freespire 1.0 (all based upon Debian). PCMCIA likewise not found by Kubuntu 7.04, Freespire 2.0, Linspire 6.0, and Kubuntu 7.10.
[2]  entered hibernation from logout panel OK, but returned with a blank screen. pushing the escape key produced an opportunity to enter my password. note that usb modem wasn't found after return from hibernation. after quick reboot, it was found but didn't work correctly. fortunately a cold reboot resolved all issues. 
[3] Internal winmodem works in Linspire 5.1.427 (based upon Debian) but apparently not in Kubuntu 7.10
