=== Current Issues ===

Monitor: (same as e.g. with Acer TravelMate 3282WXMi) Default resolution of 1024x768 does not come out well on a 1280x800 LCD display. To get working right, install package xorg-driver-fglrx. To use 1280x800, edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf and set the display driver to fglrx and add "1280x800" to mode 24 in the display modes section.

Bluetooth: bluetooth device is not recognized. 

Volume(aka Hardware volume switch): Volume control buttons do not work

Dim Monitor on Battery: not supported
