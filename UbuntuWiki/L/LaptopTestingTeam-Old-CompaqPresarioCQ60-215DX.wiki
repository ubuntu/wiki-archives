==== Notes ====

Several things need to be done to make this laptop work well in Ubuntu/Linux

As far as I can tell only Jaunty 9.04 will load and run on this hardware in 64-bit or 32-bit.
Other (older) versions fail. Have not tested beyond Jaunty.

In order to Sleep and Hibernate you must add "pci=nomsi" to the grub menu.lst file
like so:
root=UUID=xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxx ro quiet splash pci=nomsi
this will allow the laptop to come back from sleep.

I recommend that the Nvidia video drivers be loaded.

The atheros driver can be somewhat troublesome. Other drivers are available i.e. madwifi
The wireless on/off button is always orange. No solution to that.

The FN-F* keys all seem to work fine. Can dim lcd, sleep.

Laptop is stable and works well if you can follow these few tweaks.

Linux 2.6.28-15-generic #49-Ubuntu SMP Tue Aug 18 19:25:34 UTC 2009 x86_64 GNU/Linux
