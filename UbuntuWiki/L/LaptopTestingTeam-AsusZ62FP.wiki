=== Current Issues ===
* The default installation drives the gorgeous 1280x800 display at 1024x768, which makes it terribly blurry and stretched. Fixing the problem requires adding the universe repository to install the package 915resolution. This package should definitely be imported to main (unless another solution is found) because it is so vital to the correct functioning of this hardware.
* The Synaptics touchpad seems to be misidentified as a Wacom tablet, so things like scrolling and tap-dragging don't work. Curiously, running <code>dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg</code> automatically inserts the proper section into xorg.conf. If only the same thing would happen during installation...
* A CPU frequency scaling kernel module such as <code>speedstep-centrino</code> or <code>acpi-cpufreq</code> should be automatically loaded. Without one, the CPU runs at maximum speed even when idle, wasting power. A quick fix is to add one to <code>/etc/modules</code>.
