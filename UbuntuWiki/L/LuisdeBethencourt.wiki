==== About Me ====
 Computer science student and VJ living in Dublin, Ireland. Born in 1983 in the Canary Islands, Spain. With a big interest in computing, free software and audiovisual art, and a lack of talent to autodescribe himself.

Some of you met me in UDS Sevilla, UDS Boston, UDS Prague, UDS Mountain View...

== Ubuntu Work ==

==== Ubuntu Studio ====
status: leader

<nowiki>[[Ubuntu_Studio]]</nowiki> is a multimedia editing/creation flavour of Ubuntu. It's built for the GNU/Linux audio, video, and graphic enthusiast or professional.

Our aim is to make it more accessible for new users to get into the tools that GNU/Linux has to offer for multimedia creation/production. We also want to spotlight whats out there. Show users tools they might not have know existed. 

  get all the information in the website
  <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntustudio.org|ubuntustudio.org]]</nowiki>

I'm also behind the spanish community of UbuntuStudio, being in charge of the forums (http://www.ubuntu-es.org/index.php?q=forum/62) and the irc channel #ubuntustudio-es@freenode. I moderate the english forums as well.

==== Ubuntu MOTU ====
In the process of becoming a MOTU. With the pleasure of having <nowiki>[[LukeYelavich|Luke Yelavich]]</nowiki> as a mentor.

<nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LuisdeBethencourt/MOTU|List]]</nowiki> of my contributions to MOTU. [not up to date]

== Contributions to free software in general ==

==== freemix ====
Developing/experimenting with a live video editing application, <nowiki>[[http://launchpad.net/freemix|freemix]]</nowiki>
Thought for live video artists (I will be using it in my gigs), it is an application to be able to sequence, mix and filter videos on the run. 0.2beta is out. Get it while it's hot :P

==== launchpad ====
I give a hand testing new features in the launchpad beta testers team. Don't ask me about new features, a gentleman doesn't test and tell.

==== gnome ====

I'm a member of the Gnome Foundation.

==== Past development ====
In the past developed/contributed for a brief time for Gnome Hispano, Gimp and Blender.

==== Other ====
Besides my other contributions besides Ubuntu Studio, I try to advocate ubuntu/linux everytime I have a chance. Specially at my collegue, at lectures and install parties the LUG gives. 

Have given lectures about:
* Social Impact of Free Software
* GStreamer
* Gimp
* Blender
* OpenGL
* Pure Data
* Processing.org
* Linux vs. Windows
* Being creative with free software

=== More... ===
==== Teams ====

* <nowiki>[[Ubuntu_Studio]]</nowiki> - explained above
* <nowiki>[[Launchpad Beta Testers]]</nowiki> - Beta testers get to test other new Launchpad features before they are made public.
* <nowiki>[[BugsQuad]]</nowiki> - A great way to learn in Ubuntu is to fix small (and not that small) bugs. Specially unmet dependencies bugs.

* <nowiki>[[Ubuntu España]]</nowiki> - The spanish LoCo team. I usually hang around #ubuntu-es@freenode and help spanish users resolve doubts and problems. It is a great way to get spanish-speaking users since they get the support they need at the beginning in their own language.
