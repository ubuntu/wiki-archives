=== Current Issues ===

==== Ubuntu 8.04 - Installation report ====

Boots and installs fine -- no 3D hardware acceleration, though.  "Number pad" on keyboard doesn't work -- touchpad requires addition of 'SHMConfig "true"' being added to the xorg.conf file.

==== Gutsy 7.10 beta (development) - installation report ====
First boot of Gutsy 7.10beta live CD loaded fine but failed to set the video mode correctly on Gnome load.
Pressing <Ctrl>+<Alt>+<F1> switched to text mode log on fine and then pressing <Ctrl>+<Alt>+<F7> brought up the gnome desktop with correct video mode.

Clock had lost day-light savings setting.

The installer failed after pressing "Next" at "Migrate Documents and Settings".  The computer stood silent with no processor/disk load for 10 minutes.  After pressing cancel I started filling in this report (i.e. no hang).  Second attempt got as far as "Installing System", "5% - Creating ext3 file system for / in partition #3 of SCSI1 (0,0,0)..." and again silently stopped.

After a reboot of the live-cd daylight saving setting was automatically corrected.  

Installation went smoothly on this attempt.

Downloaded and installed updates ("partial upgrade required").
Enabled 3rd party driver for nVidia 3D acceleration.
