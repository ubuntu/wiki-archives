=== What is it? ===

The lpad package enables <nowiki>[[http://golang.org|Go]]</nowiki> programs to very comfortably
communicate with the Launchpad API for building reports, task automation, etc.

The package is still evolving, and there are many uncovered aspects in the API,
but the current set is already significant and adding support for additional
bits is trivial.  It's also possible to use the dynamic layer of the package to
do any action in the API, despite the existence of a more convenient wrapper or not.

=== API documentation ===

The API documentation is comprehensive and is currently available at:

    http://goneat.org/lp/lpad

=== Example ===

Here is a simple example which connects to authenticates to Launchpad in the
command line, waits for the user to confirm the authentication, and then
prints the user's name:

<pre>
package main

import (
    "launchpad.net/lpad"
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    root, err := lpad.Login(lpad.Production, &lpad.ConsoleOAuth{})
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    me, err := root.Me()
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    fmt.Println(me.DisplayName())
}
</pre>

=== How to build and install ===

To make use of lpad, just run the following command:
<pre>
$ go get launchpad.net/lpad
</pre>

=== Reporting bugs ===

Please report bugs at:
