=== Current Issues ===
(Not for Jaunty) Built-in bluetooth doesn't work, but a cheap bluetooth dongle works flawlessly.  Splash screen does not display unless a video mode is specified in the kernel arguments (e.g. include vga=791 in the defoptions line in /boot/grub/menu.lst).

Sometimes machine does not power off on halt unless the user hits "Enter" or the "Power Button" after the splash screen progress bar empties and the hard drive activity light chokes out one final flash.

The 4520 is affected by the HDD cycle count issue as <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=5039237|observed]]</nowiki> frequently in many laptops.  (This is an issue afflicting Windows, too, although it's we Linux propeller heads who actually do something about it.)    Long story short, frequent head parking on a laptop hard drive can decrease the life of the drive.  However, infrequent head parking causes the drive to run hot, as well as making the drive less guarded against bumps.  My solution to this is a crontabbed bash script.  The script can be found <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=5039237&postcount=16|here]]</nowiki>.

==== Notes ====
The wireless NIC in this laptop uses an Atheros AR5007 chipset.  In Hardy, the kernel misidentifies it as an AR5006.  Unknown how Jaunty identifies the chipset, but wireless just works in Jaunty.

Jaunty: The greatest problem is that of Suspend and Resume. After the suspend command, once the screen goes blank and the processes sleep(look our for HDD Led to go steady), one has to keep pressing the power button until the power LED goes from constant Green to Blinking Orange. There is no fixed number of times that you need to press the power button. Sometimes it's one. The maximum I have pressed for a succesful suspend is 14.

Jaunty: Hibernation works well. (very slow, though). At times, the laptop does not power itself off completely. After the OS is halted, the screen continues to be lit, and the power LED continues to blink orange. Closing the Lid and waiting for a few seconds ensures successful hibernation.
Waking up from Hibernation is usually fine most of the times. But occasionally, the boot up stops half way, just before the gui shows. Pressing any key on the keyboard a few times will revive the processes. I use one of the arrow keys.

The webcam works with Kopete and Cheese, but not Gyache or its derivatives, nor with other older apps which rely on old versions of Linux Video
