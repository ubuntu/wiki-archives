=== Current Issues with Gutsy ===

Installation:
* Live-CD wont boot! (Workaround --> read below)

Hardware issues:
* Several performance issues with ATI's new driver 8.42.3(?), XGL and AIGLX -- No 3D effects under dual monitor working!  (For more information search on ubuntuforums!)

All other hardware works out of the box!

Software issues:
* Brightness applet does not work

=== Issues with Feisty ===
* Live-CD wont boot!
* Installation... :
1. Install of ubuntu-7.04-alternate-i386 (text mode)
2. Update & Upgrade in latest kernel version
3. Install restricted drivers through terminal: "sudo apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-$(uname -r)"
4. Reboot

* Speaker does not deactivate when headphones plugged-in

=== Issues with Edgy ===
* Live-CD's don't boot (Dapper, Edgy)

* Installation successful with Edgy DVD in '''''text mode''''' (haven't seen text mode installation option in edgy live-cd! - ???)

* Only ATI linux driver version '''8.34.8''' will allow GDM to start (supports new ATI Radeon Xpress 1250 IGP)
  > Read information: http://www2.ati.com/drivers/linux/linux_8.34.8.html & http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/8.34.8

  > Install instructions: http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Edgy_Installation_Guide

* No 3D acceleration (currently not supported by ati linux driver 8.34.8)

* The Atheros wireless system works with madwifi driver 0.9.3 ==> http://madwifi.org/wiki/UserDocs/FirstTimeHowTo

* Speaker does not mute when connecting headphones or external speakers

* Touchpad works by adding in /etc/X11/xorg.conf under the section "Synaptics Touchpad" the following: '''Options "SHMConfig" "true"''' and can be configured with qsynaptics or gsynaptics (packages than can be installed from the repositories). [If section is missing then: '''sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg''' & restart X. In case the system doesn't boot up properly after that, start Ubuntu in rescue mode and reconfigure ati driver with "aticonfig --initial". Restart again.]

* USB mouse (IntelliMouse Optical 1.0) does not work always if connected before boot-up (!)
