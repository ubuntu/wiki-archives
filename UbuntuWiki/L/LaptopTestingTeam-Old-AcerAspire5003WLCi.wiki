I'm back to the 32-bit version.

=== GUTSY GIBBON (fresh install) ===
Installation notes - Install went fine.
When I booted up, I got a dialog box for the Restricted Drivers Manager.
It found the wireless card and the modem and asked if I wanted to install the proprietary drivers.  (Note, you'll need the hard-wired connection for this one-time setup).
I said "yes" and it downloaded and installed what it needed.
During the install you are asked if you want to download additional files which are required. The answer is "yes".

Battery monitor now accurately reports the time left until fully charged.

=== Current Issues (with 32-bit Gutsy Gibbon) ===
Screen resolution should be 1280x800, instead it's 1024x768.  
It looks OK, though.

Touchpad scrolling - still does not work, and attempting to scroll down acts as if I right-clicked the mouse

NOTE: Suspend and hibernate seem to function better in this version.

==== Notes ====
The Launch keys are configurable under System->Preferences->Keyboard Shortcuts.  
Where I have said they are "configurable", that means they are undefined out-of-box, but work after you manually configure them.

I did a not-so-thorough performance test to compare the difference between Breezy 32-bit and 64-bit ubuntu/imagemagick by running imagemagick's convert utility on the same set of 85 jpg images.  It took 94 seconds on 32-bit, it took 77 seconds on 64-bit (an 18% performance boost)

=== WIRELESS CARD NOTES ===
These steps are required for Dapper Drake (6.06 LTS)
They should NOT be used for Feisty Fawn (7.04) and later

* <nowiki>[[..-AcerAspire5003WLCiWifi]]</nowiki> this details exact steps for this laptop.
