==== Notes ====
Wi-fi doesn't work out of the box.  The chipset is detected, but the module doesn't load.
Chipset: BCM4318 (Airforce One 54g™ 802.11b/g WLAN with 125HSM / SpeedBooster support)
There's a HOWTO at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=405990 that will guide you through setting it up with fcutter.  This method definitely works on this laptop, enabling the wi-fi antenna button and light, but it limits speeds to 11Mbps.  Apparently, this bottleneck can be avoided using ndiswrapper, but I haven't had any luck with that.  

Sound recorder doesn't seem to work out of the box, but all of the hardware seems to be working properly individually.  I can hear the microphone directly through the headphones.

You may notice that the External Monitor Fn Key button works, but the external monitor doesn't.  When I tested the external monitor port (Daewoo C729BBK), the key would reset the monitor, but the monitor continued to report "no signal."

The video card (ATI RADEON® XPRESS 200M IGP) also doesn't work right out of the box. Enabling the proprietary ATI drivers (by clicking System - Administration - Restricted Drivers Manager) and rebooting enables hardware rendering, but doesn't seem to get the external monitor working.

NOTE: beryl-manager does NOT support 3d on the 200M!  2D acceleration only! http://www.howtoforge.com/ubuntu_feisty_beryl_ati_radeon
