==== Notes ====
1. The "DVD" and "Quickplay" keys does not have any function os they are useless.
2. The Wireless LED doesnt stay blue all the time but it pulses to blue and orange , anyways the ireless on/off switch works correctly.

This unit also has a remote with the media keys which most of the keys have correct functionality.

===== Hibernate & Sleep =====
Resumes from hibernate & sleep correctly.
