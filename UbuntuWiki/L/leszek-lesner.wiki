===== About Me =====
<nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/leszek-lesner?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=Ich1.png|<nowiki>[[File:Ich1.png]]</nowiki></nowiki>]]

I was born 08.05.1986 in Gdansk (Poland) and live in Cologne (Germany) now. 
I studied computer science in Gummersbach and got my Bachelor of Science in 2012.
Here a little story how I got involved in Linux and Ubuntu:

I got my first computer in 1997. In 1998 I got my first Linux Distro on CD within a PC-Magazin. (I think it was DLD Linux with KDE 1.0) 
I played a while with it but decide to delete it and stick with Windows 95. 
After the release of Windows 98 I had a lot of troubles with it and searched for a new , easy linux distro and found SuSE Linux 7.0 .
It was my first distro I used for everyday work. Later I worked also with RedHat 7.x as it had some better hardware support, and my soundcard was supported. :) 
Then after some years again with SuSE 7.x and 8.x series I got to know Ubuntu 5.04 in a videotutorial on about-linux.com and fall in love with its simple design. 
After then my main OS was Ubuntu. 
First I start making Ubuntu more popular within a small group of friends. After that I supported a lot of people solving problems with installing and configuring Ubuntu in common Linux Forums (i.e. <nowiki>[[http://www.linux-web.de]]</nowiki>). 
Shortly after the release of Ubuntu 6.06 Dapper Drake , I had a few chats with some moderators from the Gaming and Tech and Television Site Giga.de . In October 2006 I had the chance to present <nowiki>[[http://www.giga.de/show/gigagames/maxx/00134496_ubuntu_606_dapper_drake_so/|Ubuntu 6.06 at Giga TV]]</nowiki>   (<nowiki>[[http://video.google.de/videoplay?docid=-2038722212698561076&ei=Qn-cSLvlH6Xg2gK8pJzwBA&q=giga+leszek|Video]]</nowiki> ) 
After my good experiences after the show and the overwhelming feedback from the community (especially the <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntuuser.de]]</nowiki> community) I started wondering what can I do more to support Ubuntu. 
I came up with the idea of short tutorial videos (screencast) to show how to install and configure Ubuntu especially for all Windows "Switchers". This screencasts are now known as <nowiki>[[http://leszek.lesner.googlepages.com/ubuntu-switcher|Ubuntu Switcher]]</nowiki> Episodes. 
This screencasts are in german language only so far. 

After this few contributions to Ubuntu I started thinking of supporting my old friends from the BeOS Community and make it easier for them to switch to Linux and Ubuntu. 
I started working on a own little distribution initally called Zebuntu and is now called <nowiki>[[http://www.zevenos.com|ZevenOS]]</nowiki>. It does not only reimplement the style and touch of BeOS but it also comes with some new interesting tools like MAGI 2 (see <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/magi2]]</nowiki>) that is an easy to use application launcher and installer especially made for beginners and older people that never worked before with a computer. 
Lots of little other apps have been born throughout ZevenOS. YAVTD a Youtube Video Downloading app and Encode an ffmpeg encoding gui for easy encoding and transcoding videos and many many more. 
I presented ZevenOS at the TV Show <nowiki>[[http://www.cczwei.de|CCZwei]]</nowiki>. The show is hosted by two of the early pioneers of computer and technology in germany (W. Back & W. Rudolph) (link: <nowiki>[[http://www.cczwei.de/index.php?id=tvissuearchive&tvissueid=37|ZevenOS@CCZwei]]</nowiki>) 

Since 2012 I am also contributing to the german linux radio podcast show <nowiki>[[http://www.radiotux.de|RadioTux]]</nowiki>
