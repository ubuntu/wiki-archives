Subject: Lubuntu Vivid Vervet 15.04 Beta 1 Released

----

The Beta 1 pre-release of Lubuntu Vivid Vervet 15.04 is now available. Please check the [release notes][1] for more information as well as download locations.

As you can see from the [release schedule][2], Beta 2 will be released 26 March, with the final release on 23 April. Releases are available for testing only 2 days before release. That being said, I really encourage anyone interested in [QA][3] to start working with the dailies so we don't have any surprises at the last minute.

If there are any questions about this release or the workload for the rest of the cycle, please don't hesitate to get in touch, either with me or with the [lubuntu-qa team][4]. Thanks!
