==== Notes ====
To get hardware headphones switch working (and headphones jack working in general), you have to add ''model=vaio'' parameter to snd_hda_intel module. Create file ''/etc/modprobe.d/sony-laptop'' and add to it:

  option snd-hda-intel  model=vaio

To get working backlight control in Intrepid, you have to set BACKLIGHT_CONTROL property to native (or any other value but kernel, which is unfortunately default).
You can do that using:
 xrandr --output LVDS --set BACKLIGHT_CONTROL native

Then, in intrepid, it should start to work.

Last time i tried bluetooth, it needs reset first time after boot. You can do that by addding to ''/etc/modprobe.d/sony-laptop'':

  options hci-usb reset=1

I believe you can also reset it by hand using
  sudo hciconfig hci0 reset
