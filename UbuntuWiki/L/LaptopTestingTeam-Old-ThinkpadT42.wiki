==== Notes ====
Wireless card: IBM 802.11a/b/g with an Atheros chipset; works with the Atheros driver

Observations during boot after hibernation: Ubuntu boots like normal, then I see some vertical brown lines, then some black and white squares, then the cursor shows up.  Shortly, I see the login dialog.  After logging in, there are no more traces of strange graphics and my session is restored without problems.  NetworkManager even reconnects to my wireless network :)
