=== Current Issues ===

One annoying issue: Ubuntu Breezy doesn't detect the battery. It only ever displays "Battery status unknown" in the applet.
Minor problems: Hibernate works, but the WLAN card has to be reactivated manually afterwards. Some of the Fn+x key combinations don't work.

==== Notes ====
Note 1: The notebook has a "smart" battery installed. It is detected by "dmidecode". The battery state is read via the System Managment Bus (SMBus). With a kernel patch it is supposed to work.

Note 2: Suspend to Mem via "echo mem >/sys/power/state" almost works: It falls asleep fine, and wakes fine, but after waking up, it shuts down immediately!!

Note 3: PCMCIA works - also using hotplug while plugging in. But: Plugging out a PCMCIA-USB-Card while running made the computer power off immediately!
