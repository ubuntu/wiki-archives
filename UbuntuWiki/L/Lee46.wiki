=== About me ===

Hi, my name is Lee Mitchell and I have been using Ubuntu since 2005. I run Ubuntu on just about everything I can, if I could run it on my toaster, I would!

I live in Livingston, Scotland and I would really like to contribute to the community, possibly by doing some coding, etc. As well as programming for Linux, I am an avid Mac and iPhone programmer.

Playing with Ubuntu, Objective-C Programming, etc.

=== My Ubuntu Update ===

I really need to update to Jaunty on my Eee PC because i'm still running Hardy. But oh well, at least it works!
