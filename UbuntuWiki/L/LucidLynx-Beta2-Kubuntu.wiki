== Introduction ==
Kubuntu will release version 10.04, the Lucid Lynx, in April 2010. This will be an <nowiki>[[LTS|LTS]]</nowiki> release, so our overall focus will be bringing a more stable and polished desktop to our users. However, this does not mean there will be nothing new or exciting. Quite the contrary! Read on for highlights of what is new and upcoming for Kubuntu 10.04.

'''NOTE:''' ''This is a beta (pre-) release. Pre-release versions of Lucid are '''__NOT__''' encouraged for anyone needing a stable system or for anyone who is not comfortable running into occasional, even frequent, breakage. Pre-release versions '''__ARE__''' recommended for Kubuntu developers and those who want to help in testing, reporting, and fixing bugs.' Please do not use this in a production environment with data  or workflows that you cannot do without''

== What's New in Beta 2 ==
=== Kubuntu Logo ===
Along with the rest of Ubuntu we have been updating our branding.  In Beta 2 we are trialing our new logo.

=== KDE Plasma Desktop 4.4.2 ===
<nowiki>[[attachment:desktop.png|<nowiki>[[File:wee-desktop.png]]</nowiki></nowiki>]]

<nowiki>[[http://kde.org/announcements/announce-4.4.2.php|KDE Software Compilation 4.4]]</nowiki> is the next version of the popular Plasma Desktop and Applications by KDE.  The improved System Tray now can include various widgets, such as the improved Device Notifier and  our Indicator Display. Nepomuk Semantic Search has matured greatly. New features such as grouping windows into tabs have been added, and new and improved widgets, desktop effects, and configuration/ui changes are just some of the great things found in this latest version.

=== Official Kubuntu Netbook Remix release ===
<nowiki>[[attachment:netbook.png|<nowiki>[[File:wee-netbook.png]]</nowiki></nowiki>]]

Sit back and relax while installing Kubuntu and watch the lovely slideshow showcasing KDE applications included in the default installation. Or just use them, since it's a Live CD. ;-)

=== Touchpad Configuration ===
<nowiki>[[File:wee-touchpad.png]]</nowiki>

The new touchpad configuration section of System Settings allows you to fine-tune how your laptop's touchpad behaves.

=== System Notification Polish ===
The notifications for available codecs, required restarts and upgrade information have been further integrated into the KDE notification system, giving these notifications a seamless way to integrate with the rest of the notifications the Plasma desktop provides. They have also been optimized, taking up much less RAM than before.

=== KDE integration for Firefox ===
<nowiki>[[File:wee-firefox.png]]</nowiki>

Firefox now integrates better with KDE, providing native KDE file dialogs as well as respecting your default choices for opening files, as set in KDE.

=== GNOME app systray integration ===
Work has gone in to integrating GNOME tray icons into the Plasma desktop, so that GNOME apps supporting the integration will share a consistent appearance with the rest of your KDE apps.

== Known Issues ==
* Bug:538136 Message Indicator widget doesn't move from panel to systray on upgrade
* Bug:556376	KDE frontend hangs on timezone page unless mouse is moved
