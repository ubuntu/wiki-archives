=== Current Issues ===
==== Installation issues ====
* It is likely that every installation process will work perfectly using any Breezy or Dapper version.  Downloading and using the latest eMachines BIOS is recommended when installing 32 bit Ubuntu, and mandatory for 64 bit. Check BIOS upgrade procedures at the web page above.
==== Hardware issues ====
* Broadcom WiFi adapter can only be controlled through ndiswrapper (HowtoUseNdiswrapperOnAmd64Ubuntu) with satisfactory results.
* Everytime the linux kernel updates, you must remove and recompile / install ndiswrapper all over again; a massive pain.
* The scroll wheel on the right of the touchpad is not configured exactly and is wider than the correct area allocated.
* On bootup, screen automatically dims to lowest brightness level possible, everytime. (Bug #40336)
* Had to deactivate and the reactivate wireless card to get online again after hibernation.

* Current tests conducted at Breezy64, Dapper64 (Preview).
