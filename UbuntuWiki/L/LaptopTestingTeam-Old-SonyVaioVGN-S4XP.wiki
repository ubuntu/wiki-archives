=== Current Issues ===

* Touchpad settings (i.e. none but the defaults) are usable but rather odd for the extra-wide touchpad.

* Setting `Option "SHMConfig" "true"` in `/etc/X11/xorg.conf` would allow setting and experimenting with touchpad settings using the command-line `synclient`.

* On resume from hibernation, touchpad scrolling does not always work.  Switching consoles (Ctrl+Alt+F1, Ctrl+Alt+F7) seems to fix it.

* The headphone ALSA driver (`snd_hda_intel`) control is named `Front`.

* UPDATE: with the -25 kernel revision, it is called Headphone as it should be.  Sadly, the volume buttons are now broken.  They control the "Headphone" level rather than PCM which would be more useful.  I have found a <nowiki>[[#alsa-fix|work-around]]</nowiki> for this.

* There is no driver for the Sony memory stick reader (Texas Instruments PCI7420/PCI7620).

==== Notes ====

* In the -25 kernel revision of Dapper, the volume keys control the "Headphone" level rather than "PCM" as would be more useful (as was, IIRC, what happed in the -23 initial released version).

* Because of <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/control-center/+bug/22876|this bug]]</nowiki>, there is no simple way to make the volume keys affect a more useful control but I have found a solution that works for me by making ALSA rename the "PCM" control it creates "Master".

     1. Ensure you have nothing in `~/.asoundrc` that will get in the way of these changes.  If you have been editing your `.asoundrc` file you are likely to know if it will interfere!

     2. Edit `/usr/share/alsa/cards/HDA-Intel.conf` and replace the string `PCM Playback Volume` with `Master` (the string occurs in two places).

     3. To ensure you get a clean restart, remove the file `/var/lib/alsa/asound.state` (which is used to reload you card settings on startup) and remove the link `/etc/rc6.d/K50alsa-utils`.

     4. Reboot.  You can then re-link `ln -s /etc/init.d/alsa-utils /etc/rc6.d/K50alsa-utils`.  Of course, all you really need to do is remove and reload the ALSA drivers, but that is messy enough that I find rebooting easier.

  There is almost certainly some simple magic I can put in `~/.asoundrc` to rename or alias the PCM control so that `gnome-sttrings-daemon` uses it in response to the volume keys, but I have not found it.  If you know, please drop me an e-mail!

* With the `sonypi` module (add to `/etc/modules)`, other Fn + key combinations can be deteted and mapped.  They are Fn + Esc, F1, F8-11, E, S, D, F, B, 1 and 2 plus the Fn key on its own.  Some of these are handled by ACPI, so you can program them with files in `/etc/acpi/events`.

* S1 & S2.  These two generate the same evets, so you can't tell them apart.  In addition, each press generated two ACPI key events (or input events on `/dev/input/event4`) so be sure to take that into account or any defined "action" will occur twice.  This is a low-level and long-standing problem with Sony Vaios.
