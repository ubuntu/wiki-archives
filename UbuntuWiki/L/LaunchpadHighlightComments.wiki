In Launchpad, the intent of the karma mechanism is to help in weighing the value of comments from different people. However currently it is difficult to get a sense for the karma of each commenter, without having to navigate out of the bug to the person's summary page (way too much effort).

Instead, comments from high-karma users could be indicated through subtle highlighting of the comments. For instance, the background of the comment box could be a shade darker than usual. Perhaps several shades could be used on a logarithmic scale.

As well, in triaging bugs, it is often important to quickly see when a comment is from the original reporter, vs. someone giving a confirmation. For instance, if someone says, "Yes, that fixed it", it's really important to know if that's the original reporter or not. Something as simple as making the original reporter's name bold would suffice.
