=== Hardware Acquisition and QA Plan ===

Duncan will work with Maria to get a hardware PO. He will order the devices and have them sent to Andy and Bryce. Brian already has a device for testing. Development, testing, and QA will be performed on these devices.

==== Desired Hardware ====

* Dell Studio 17 - Bryce Harrington
* Dell XT2 -  Bryce Harrington
* Stantum device - TBD
* HP TX2 - Andy Whitcroft (Brian Murray has one of his own as well)

==== Possible Issues ====

* Dell releases the Studio 17 in April; Robbie's got a contact at Dell and has made a request for this device. Given the probably lack of a Studio 17, we're going to order a Dell XT2.
* Alberto hasn't been able to get a development kit from Stantum and prototype devices use unsupported Poulsbo  graphics. If OEMs are interested, we can put additional effort here.
