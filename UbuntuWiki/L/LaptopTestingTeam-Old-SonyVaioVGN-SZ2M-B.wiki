=== Current Issues ===
Suspend and Hibernate don't work by default. Now I'm using s2disk, and hibernate is working only the first time you use it, the second one everything is a mess.

==== Notes ====

As I have explained before, the suspend and hibernation is working partially. The external monitor works if you tune the xorg.conf by hand, I had  to read some tutorials about enabling xinerama. However, if I needed to use a projector I only have to restart the laptop with the projector connected.
