=== Current Issues ===
Running beryl in Dapper.
Had to uninstall libgl1-mesa-dri to run upgrade. After that, upgrade ran smoothly, but xorg was broken.  Put old gdm.conf-custom back, then restarted.
Had to reinstall beryl and emerald.  Everything back to working order.  Using beryl-manager in startup causes gdm to fail.  Ctrl-Alt-Bksp fixes.  This is a beryl related issue which is supposedly fixed in the SVN version.
