=== Current Issues ===
On Edgy (Release Candidate):

* the live install CD hangs in "copying files..." when progress is at about 50%; alt install works OK
* the right Alt key fails: it is completely ignored
* suspending through Fn + F3 works, but then only sometimes is it possible to awaken from the suspended state
* suspending through Gnome blanks the screen, but fails to suspend completely since there is still occasional hard disk activity; it's impossible to reawaken from this semi-suspended state

On both Edgy (Release Candidate) and Dapper:

* resolution after install is 1024x768, which looks blurry; to get the correct resolution (1280x800) I need to install the 915resolution package manually
* sound works only sometimes; after each boot it either works or it doesn't
* nautilus-cd-burner works, but hangs for 4 minutes before starting to write any CD.  cdrecord  from the command line works without the 4-minute hang if I run it as root. 
* suspend through "acpitool -s" works, but then the laptop fails to reawaken

On Dapper:

* Gnome shows no option to suspend my laptop; I must use acpitool to suspend
* After I press any function key (such as Fn + Page Up) the X cursor either vanishes or looks corrupted; sometimes it restores itself after a short time, and other times I have to log out to get the cursor back
