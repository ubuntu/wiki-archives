==== Notes ====
1. Would only adjust headphone volume by default. Easily fixed.
2. Has dedicated touchpad on/off key. Launches "Help" when turned off then on. Touchpad seems to be disabled for a time when switching users, or when X is restarted. Installing the Synaptic driver does not help. 11/26 - This seems to have been fixed in recent updates.
3. the Fn+Delete combination also does a "Print Screen" (save screenshot).
4. The "DVD" key is used to launch a software DVD player that exists on a separate partition from Windows Vista. When I installed Ubuntu, it was erased. I don't think it has any other functionality. It seems if you touch the "DVD" key with out the partition there, the computer hangs. The only way I fixed it was to remove the battery for a minute, then reboot.

Wireless on/off switch works correctly.
This unit also has a remote with the media keys which most of the keys have correct functionality.

===== External monitor =====
S-Video port works fine

===== ExpressCard/54 =====
Also supports ExpressCard/34 cards

===== Hibernate & Sleep =====
Resumes from hibernate & sleep correctly.
