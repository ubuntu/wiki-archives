==== Other Lubuntu images ====

All images of the latest Lubuntu version for different PC architectures are available on the Download Overview page. Thanks to The SII and Lafibre we have secondary download servers here: <nowiki>[[http://thesii.org/iso/ | Server 1]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[http://lubuntu.lafibre.info/12.04/ | Server 2]]</nowiki>.

~-For computers with low RAM please use the Alternate or Minimal Images of Lubuntu.-~

=== Low RAM Computers ===
Computers with less than 600 MB of RAM may fall into the class of low-RAM computers. There are special images available for low RAM PCs on the <nowiki>[[http://cdimages.ubuntu.com/lubuntu/releases/precise/release/ | Images Overview page]]</nowiki>. As some old hardware is not always supported in newer Linux kernels, you can refer to previous versions of Lubuntu below. Support for the i386, i486, i586 chipsets (VIA C3, AMD K6, National Semiconductor and AMD Geode) has been dropped from both the kernel and GCC after Lubuntu 10.04 (<nowiki>[[http://lubuntu.lafibre.info/10.04/| Download Lubuntu 10.04]]</nowiki>). Please use Lubuntu 10.04 for this hardware.

'''Alternate (Non-Graphical Install) for Low RAM Computers:''' The Alternate images on the download page for 32-bit and 64-bit computers allow installing Lubuntu to PCs with less than 4.3GB Hard Disk and below 256MB RAM.

'''Minimal Installation Image for lower RAM:''' Using the minimal ISO, it is possible to install and run lubuntu-core on a PC with only 64 MB of RAM.  128 MB of RAM are considered the minimal requirements for a usable Lubuntu Desktop system.  Even with 128 MB, you will have problems (apparent freezing) running memory hungry applications like the Chromium web browser.  In that case, we recommend using the low-memory web browser called <nowiki>[[https://opensource.conformal.com/wiki/xxxterm | xxxterm]]</nowiki>, which is available throught the Lubuntu Software Center.

'''Live-CD Requirements:''' The LiveCD included in the Desktop ISO (when you choose 'Try Lubuntu' in the installation process) requires at least 300 MB of RAM.  The LiveCD uses more RAM as the the file system is build in the RAM during the Live Demo. The memory requirements are 100-200 MB higher compared to a system with Lubuntu installed on the harddrive.

'''Installing with graphical interface on Low-RAM systems:''' On the 'Desktop ISO', The graphical installer <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Ubiquity |Ubiquity]]</nowiki> requires about 200-400 MB of RAM to run, and over 300 to run quickly.  This requirement does not include the RAM required to run the LiveCD (100-200 MB).  So running the graphical installer by using the option 'Try Lubuntu' in the installer requires more RAM.

=== Tipps for Lubuntu ===

'''Lubuntu Live-CD and Live-USB:''' Did you know that you can use the bootable <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_CD | LiveCDs ]]</nowiki> to backup your data? Downloading the Desktop ISO will allow you run in LiveCD, a fully functional Lubuntu without making changes to your hard disk.  You can see if Lubuntu is fully compatible with your computer, or needs a little extra work (an example being a BroadCom WiFi chip).

'''Lubuntu Torrents:''' Wherever possible, please use the torrent links to download the  <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_image | ISOs.]]</nowiki> Torrent downloads can be faster and will help stop the servers slowing to a crawl (as well as the additional costs for the bandwidth). Once you have your system running, please torrent seed the new releases. See <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1259923 | article about torrents on the forums]]</nowiki> for more information.

'''Error Check:''' Always <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/Documentation/CheckISO_CD | Check your ISO and CD]]</nowiki> for errors. Those few minutes can save you a lot of heartache.

'''Back up:''' It's easy to delete all data stored on your hard disk.  Please backup your information.   <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Partitioning/Home/Moving | "Moving /home"]]</nowiki> is one way to save all your settings.

'''32-bit or 64-bit?''' PCs older than about 2007 are not usually 64-bit compatible.  You may need a <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/32bit_and_64bit| 32-bit ISO]]</nowiki> instead of a 64-bit ISO.

=== 12.04 ===
Precise Pangolin will be supported until October 2013.  The Lubuntu team does not offer a Long term support release (LTS) at this time.  There are three types of releases available for Intel and AMD based computers. All Installation images are available on the <nowiki>[[http://cdimages.ubuntu.com/lubuntu/releases/precise/release/| Download Page for Lubuntu 12.04]]</nowiki> (except for minimal install).
* Desktop (Graphical Installer) - These versions are suitable for PC's with over 256 MB of RAM.  Do not try to install 64 Bit on a 32 Bit machine. Installing 32 Bit onto 64 Bit is totally safe. Please see the section <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/GetLubuntu#Low_RAM_Computers | Low RAM computers]]</nowiki> for installations on computers with less resources.
* Alternate (Non-Graphical Install) - The Alternate images for 64-bit and 32-bit computers allow installing Lubuntu to PCs  with less than 4.3GB Hard Disk and low RAM (below 256MB).
* Minimal Install - The <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/Documentation/MinimalInstall | Minimal Install]]</nowiki> images holds the lowest resource system. It is known to work on a Pentium 2 with 64MB of RAM when using the lubuntu core system.
* Intel Mac Images - The lubuntu desktop system should run quite happily on all of the Intel Mac series, use the alternate versions only if you have non-standard setups. Lubuntu has been found to run on a G4 running at 867MHz with 640MiB RAM, although it was noted that using the Alternate Installer was a lot faster. Another tester found that a G3 CPU: 400MHz required the following: Live CD|| 384 MiB RAM || 4.0 GB HDD || or the alternate version Alt CD || 192 MiB RAM || 2.1 GB HDD ||

=== 11.10 ===
Oneiric Ocelot will be supported until April 2013. It was the first official release as part of the Ubuntu cycle. Please do read the  <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lubuntu/ReleaseNotes/OneiricOcelot |Release Notes]]</nowiki> before installing or raising bug reports.

Do not try to install 64 Bit on a 32 Bit machine. Installing 32 Bit onto 64 Bit is totally safe. 
* Alternate (Non-Graphical Install) - 64/32 bit Versions For those computers with low RAM.  Also allows installing to PC's  with less than 4.3GB Hard Disk. 
* Minimal Install - <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/Documentation/MinimalInstall | Minimal Install]]</nowiki> holds our lowest resource system. It is known to work on a Pentium 2 with 64MB of RAM when using the lubuntu core system.

=== 11.04 ===
11.04 will be supported until October 2012.

* 32 bit - official version is available as a torrent and iso. There are two download servers for images available <nowiki>[[http://lubuntu.lafibre.info/11.04/| here]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[http://phillw.net/lubuntu-11.04.iso | here]]</nowiki>. 
* 64 bit - community generated versions are available <nowiki>[[http://lubuntu.lafibre.info/11.04/|here]]</nowiki>. Checking this 64 Bit version is discussed at <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/Documentation/CheckISO_CD#11.04 64 bit Community Edition | About 64 Bit]]</nowiki>
* 32 and 64 bit minimal install - For those people with less than 160MB of available RAM (Typically 192MB for computers with built in graphics). It is a full installation but does not use the standard installer. This minimal version is discussed at the <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/Documentation/MinimalInstall | minimal install]]</nowiki> page.

* 32 bit minimal install - For those people with less than 160MB of available RAM (Typically 192MB for computers with built in graphics). It is a full installation but does not use the standard installer. This minimal version is discussed at the <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/Documentation/MinimalInstall | minimal install]]</nowiki> page.

=== Development Versions ===
The current test version for Lubuntu 12.10 will be linked here. As with all alphas and non-stable betas they are not suitable for a production environment.'' For more details please see the section in our wiki for <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lubuntu/Testing/ | testing]]</nowiki>.
