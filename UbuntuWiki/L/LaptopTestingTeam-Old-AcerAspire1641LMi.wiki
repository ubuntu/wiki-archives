==== Notes ====
Sound: There was no sound after install, however it can be fixed. After the patch, everything (microphone, front speaker, headphones) works correctly. See: http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=791304&postcount=164
Battery: Battery status not detected, fix at http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=604504&postcount=72
3D works correctly. (it was reported as not working at the model 1642WLMi wiki-page)
Resolution: 1024x768@60Hz (same as Window$ default resolution)
External monitor: works, but you have to reboot the machine :(. It cannot be managed to use the TFT and an external monitor together, the Fn+F5 combination is useless.
Bluetooth&Wireless switch, hotkeys: don't work, but there is a module called '''acerhk''', which should fix it -- I haven't tried this yet (if you try it, and it works, please tell me about it ;)) 
New info: I had now the possibility to test the WLAN card, and it works correctly, even the wireless switch on the front panel is working (without the acerhk module!)
I installed the acerhk module, but it won't work - I got an error message saying 'Unknown Travelmate model' :(
Hope I'll find a solution for those leds soon - it's not that crucial, but anyway... :)

* ''Yes, please test this with  `sudo modprobe acerhk` and file a bug against `hotkey-setup`, containing the results and the `dmidecode` data as requested on: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LaptopTestingTeam/HotkeyResearch'' -PaulSladen
* Thanks for the suggestion, bug posted.

==== Notes for Edgy ====
* To use external monitor, a package named i810switch is needed. To use these features of the laptop, BIOS settings have to be changed. To mirror the monitor to external, change the relevant monitor setting (Internal/External VGA) to Both. In this case the external image exists, but it's quality is poor. This setting is also OK for Xinerama. The best choice to use a projector on this laptop with these drivers  is to set this option to External, and forget the LCD display. :(

PS.: I would be pleased if you could send me an e-mail, if you feel this page helped you a lot... :)
