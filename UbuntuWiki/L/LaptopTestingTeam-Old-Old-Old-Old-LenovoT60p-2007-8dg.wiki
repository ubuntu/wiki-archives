==== Notes ====
The computer is not half as good on battery as it is in windows. Hard to install ATI drivers, and change screen resolution. Fn+Home and Fn+End function should adjust the light, and it does. But when you use this buttons it reduses the light to the lowest, or to the highest. The rest is OK. Wireless is a dream, but never tested high speeds. This was a problem in 6.10 i remember.
