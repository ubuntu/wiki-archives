== Lubuntu Human Interface Guidelines ==

This document will help you how to create applications that look right, behave properly, and fit into the Lubuntu desktop experience as a whole. It is written for interface designers, graphic artists and software developers who will be creating software for Lubuntu. Both specific advice on making effective use of interface elements, and the philosophy and general design principles behind the Lubuntu desktop are covered.

These guidelines are meant to help you design and write applications that are easy to use and consistent with the Lubuntu desktop. Following these guidelines will have many benefits:

* Users will learn to use your program faster, because interface elements will look and behave the way they are used to.

* Novice and advanced users alike will be able accomplish tasks quickly and easily, because the interface won't be confusing or make things difficult.

* Your application will have an attractive look that fits in with the rest of the desktop.

* Your application will continue to look good when users change desktop themes, fonts and colors.

To help you achieve these goals, these guidelines will cover basic interface elements, how to use them and put them together effectively, and how to make your application integrate well with the desktop.

These guidelines are based on <nowiki>[[http://developer.gnome.org/hig-book/3.0/index-info.html.en | GNOME Human Interface Guidelines 2.2.2]]</nowiki> (Copyright © 2002-2011  Calum Benson, Adam Elman, Seth Nickell, colin z robertson) and we would like you to refer to this document for anything that is not covered here. We do not wish to steal credit from the original authors, but rather apply their guidelines to our own needs. We would also like the thank the authors of GNOME Human Interface Guidelines 2.2.2 and the GNOME Project as a whole for their hard work and dedication.

== Usability Principles ==

=== Design for Old Hardware ===
Lubuntu's philosophy is to be lightweight, fast and energy conserving. It is also meant to be an alternative to Ubuntu for people with less powerful and/or old hardware. Therefore it is very important that developers and designers take old hardware into consideration. Applications need to have the same workflow on modern computer as they do on old computers, and it is very important that applications keep low resolution monitors in mind.

=== Design for People ===
