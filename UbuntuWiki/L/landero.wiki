__TOC__

Well, My name is Luis Landero, I'm from Nicaragua, actually I study Computing Engineering at the National University of Engineering. I have been using GNU/LINUX Ubuntu since 2007 and I am member of Ubuntu-Ni. Now I am using Lucid Lynx and I think It's an excellent Operating System, that's the reason because I am using GNU/ Linux.
