=== Occupation ===

I recently started a company called Axopen, focused on desktop Linux services. Axopen is set in Lille, north of France.

=== Motivations ===

Ubuntu is by far the best Linux desktop system ever. I am a big debian fan, and i hope Ubuntu is going to make its way to personal and corporate desktop.
