==== Notes ====
* only vesa works ootb, a solution is the openchrome driver, but it has a bug which does not allow you to use xv when using the internal monitor
* no fan control before Hardy: just google for it, there is a novell patch somewhere

fan control with modified DSDT possible

too many interrupts in normal operation (powertop)
use 
" acpi_os_name="Windows 2001" acpi_sleep=s3_mode idle=mwait "
 as bootparameters
together with new DSDT.aml
