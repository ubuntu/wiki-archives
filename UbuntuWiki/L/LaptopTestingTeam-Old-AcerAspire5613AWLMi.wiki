=== Current Issues ===
I have had problems with the Desktop CD. I performed installation in text mode with the Alternate CD. I had to retry the installation process twice because the process was blocked a long time in a non-terminal state.

=== System Info ===
<pre>
bios-version:V3.33
system-manufacturer:Acer
system-product-name:Aspire 5610
system-version:V3.33

I successfully upgraded to Ubuntu 7.10.(21/10/2007)
