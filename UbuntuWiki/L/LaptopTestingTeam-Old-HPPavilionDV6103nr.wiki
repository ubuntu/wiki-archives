=== Overview ===
Ubuntu on this laptop is great.  I installed Edgy 6.10, which was very smooth, and for the most part things have just worked right out of the box / install.  I was impressed that the grub installation automatically detected my Windows partition and set it up in the boot menu.  Upon booting, sound, QuickPlay buttons, touchpad, wireless, and more all worked right away.  The screen also worked, but in order to get the proper resolution, I had to install the package <code>915resolution</code> which was easy and solved the problem as soon as the X server was restarted.  My only other complaints so far are that the headphone and mic jacks don't work properly and the battery estimates are sometimes unreliable.  For example, when the battery is almost fully charged, on occasion the battery monitor will report only 3 or 4 minutes left, or it might report something huge like 22 hours left.

=== Current Issues ===
* headphone and mic jacks don't work
* screen requires <code>915resolution</code> hack to work properly
