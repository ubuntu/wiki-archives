== Support ==
<nowiki>[[File:uduck.png]]</nowiki>

Most of the information you need about LXLE Paradigm can be found in the Ubuntu and <nowiki>[[#lubuntusupportlinks|Lubuntu support]]</nowiki> areas. '''''However''''', issues related specifically to LXLE's implementation of components will need to be addressed directly through LXLE-specific resources. Ubuntu does not provide support for such things.
 
<nowiki>[[uduck|uDuck]]</nowiki> may be the fastest way to find specific information online. This meta search engine was developed by the LXLE team for help and support.

Users are requested to try their best to find solutions to their problems before entering the live support areas, as this will weed out the frequently asked questions. Your attempt to help yourself is considered good etiquette, before asking the friendly volunteers to engage with your problems. (Clue: If nobody answers you right away, you might wonder if your question is a FAQ.)

 .LXLE Paradigm 12.04.3 LTS is a stable respin of Lubuntu 12.04.3. This means that LXLE's foundational software is Lubuntu and Ubuntu based. 

 .The best place to find support for Lubuntu and Ubuntu distros is in the Ubuntu wiki's, forums, and their respective websites. These well developed support areas can assist you with: how to format your hard drives; make installation DVDs and USBs; install software packages; and almost anything else you may encounter.

 .One of the fastest ways to find support for all kinds of Ubuntu distributions is by using a meta search tool, such as ''uDuck'', which can be <nowiki>[[uduck|installed easily with this short tutorial]]</nowiki>. uDuck toggles to uGoogle, its mate.
