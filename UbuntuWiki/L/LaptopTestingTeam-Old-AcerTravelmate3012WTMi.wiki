=== Current Issues ===

==== Monitor ====
The resolution on this baby is 1280x800 which is not recognised by driver since it can't get the information from the BIOS. Instead you get the default 1024x768 which looks weird. This is easily solved by enabling your universe repositories and installing 915resolution. Now you need to edit the file /etc/default/915resolution. Find a free mode by issuing the command 915resolution -l. Then set "MODE" to the free mode you found, "XRESO" to 1280, "YRESO" to 800 and "BIT" to 32. That's it!

==== ACPI ====
I get some funny error messages during boot from ACPI probably due to a buggy DSDT table. However everything seems to work for me so I haven't done much about it. Hibernate did not work out of the box for me. So I played around with the /etc/default/acpi-support config file for a while and after a lot of reboots it finally worked. The content of the file is listed below

<pre>
ACPI_SLEEP=true
ACPI_HIBERNATE=true
ACPI_SLEEP_MODE=standby
MODULES=""
MODULES_WHITELIST=""
VBESTATE=/var/lib/acpi-support/vbestate
POST_VIDEO=true
SAVE_VIDEO_PCI_STATE=true
HIBERNATE_MODE=platform
LOCK_SCREEN=true
STOP_SERVICES="mysql "
RESTART_IRDA=false
ENABLE_LAPTOP_MODE=false
</pre>

==== Sound ====
If you're using dapper you will need to compile sound support yourself using alsa release 1.0.13. Goto http://www.alsa-project.org and download the latest drivers. You need the following tarballs:

* alsa-driver-1.0.13.tar.bz2
* alsa-lib-1.0.13.tar.bz2
* alsa-utils-1.0.13.tar.bz2

Then follow the instructions on http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/doc-php/template.php?company=Intel&card=ICH+southbridge+HD-audio+and+modem.&chip=ICH6%2C+ICH6M%2C+ICH7%2C+ESB2&module=hda-intel and enjoy the sweet sound streaming out of your speakers. 

If you're using Edgy the alsa packages mentioned above is already included in the kernel. So it should work. I haven't tried a reinstallation using Edgy though, so I can't vouch for it.

==== Webcam ====
The webcam in this computer is a Logitech Obicam with ID 046d:0892. In order to get it working you need the gspcav1 driver that you can download from http://mxhaard.free.fr/spca50x/Download/gspcav1-20061216.tar.gz . After that you can install Camorama from the ubuntu repository and view your webcam. It should work out of the box with aMsn and Ekiga but I haven't tried it myself.
