== Calendar of Events ==

The Calendar of Events system is set to become an easy way to manage group events and ease the ability to schedule events for the team.

=== Goals ===

# Provide a nice web 2.0 feel for easy maintainability
# Allow for support of ICal feed
# Allow support for recurring events
# Allow Loco members to post when they are busy. Viewable only by other loco members. *May want to limit to only admin level members and/or members in charge of scheduling events.

=== Ideas ===

Please post all ideas you may have below for discussion.
