=== Current Issues ===
* Hibernation doesn't work, at least not with the nvidia driver. ''UPDATE! 2005-11-09:'' In Breezy, Hibernate (Suspend to disk) works. Even when on battery power. At least once, I will do more extensive testing. What's more, all I had to do was press the Fn key and F12, which has a Zzzz->disk icon on it. When I turned it on, the screen was blank at first (as usual when it didn't work). I tried to do Ctrl-Alt-Backspace twice to kill X, but lo and behold it didn't kill X instead I got a Unlock screen window. I logged in and everything was there as I left it. Awesome.
* Function keys doesn't work. Erik Waling has made a patch to sonypi which is said to fix this, at least for the S4 series (which seems to be basically the same laptop). However, I haven't had the time to test this yet. ''Update (2005-09-05):'' I have patched sonypi, and it indeed works. The Fn keys now send acpi events. I have not tried any tools to handle these events yet, but I intend to asap. The patch is available from http://www.acc.umu.se/~erikw/program/patch-2.6.12.3-sonypi_type3_models
* Setting screen brightness doesn't work out of the box, but using the tool SmartDimmer by Erik Waling it is possible. SmartDimmer is available from http://www.acc.umu.se/~erikw/program/smartdimmer-0.1.tar.bz2

==== Notes ====
* In Breezy, the synaptics driver seems to be overridden somehow when X loads. The touchpad works, but none of the special stuff like right/middle click and scrolling works. ''Update (2005-09-05):'' Since a couple of days back, the touchpad works better again. I haven't had time to investigate much, but I guess it's because of Daniel Stone's latest fix, see his comment: http://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/show_bug.cgi?id=5734#c23 . However, the touchpad is now very sensitive to tap-to-click and a little "jittery". ''Update:'' It doesn't work in stable Breezy.
* For more information on screen brightness, function keys and other issues relating this laptop, see http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-361872.html
* A driver for the TI PCI7x20 flash memory chip is mentioned here, but the actual driver is nowhere to be found. Really annoying. I have e-mailed TI but still awaiting answer (2005-11-09). The webpage: http://www.everestinc.com/fml.htm
