=== Issues with Breezy ===
Xorg dies when switching virtual terminals.  To be precise, it dies when switching back to X from a virtual console.  Problem occurs when running using 24 as the colour depth in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.  Switching to 16 bit depth has removed the problem.

==== Notes ====

Overall, working very nicely indeed.

Only real issue is the X-crashing on switch to virtual terminal, but using 16 bit colour depth solves that one.  The video card uses the i810 driver and as far as I can tell from googling around that driver has a few issues.

Once X is fixed, suspend and hibernate both work a treat (suspend requiring enabling by un-commenting ACPI_SLEEP in /etc/default/acpi-support.

Infra-red (irda) required a little tinkering:

I added the following to /etc/modules:

<pre>
ircomm-tty
irtty-sir
irda
</pre>

Other than that the main obstacle was realising that infra-red was turned off in the BIOS.

Successfully used infra-red to talk to a nokia 6610i and also able to set up a gprs connection via infra-red.

Volume controls all working well, only complaint is gnome-volume-control itself which only controls the speaker volume, not the headphone jack.
