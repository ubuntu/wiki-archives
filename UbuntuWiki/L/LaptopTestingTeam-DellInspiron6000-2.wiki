Did not work for me.
-- JulianYap 
Sleep was highly unstable for me as well.  I also had the blank screen on resume.  To solve, edit the configuration file at ''/etc/default/acpi-support'', and uncomment the second line, '''# ACPI_SLEEP=true'''.  Then restart.  That should enable proper sleep functionality.
-- GregUnger (2006-04-27)
Update: this has no real effect.  Resume from sleep is still hit-or-miss.  It works fine if I resume right away, but not always if I let it sleep for a while.

S-video does not work.  -- GregUnger (2006-04-27)

I've filed a bug report on Sleep, #41969.  -- GregUnger (2006-04-28)

Sleep works just fine for me in Dapper Final -- BrandonHale (2006-06-04)

Yes, Sleep works fine for me in Dapper Final also.  However, on resume, it seems to break Alps Touchpad scrolling?  Minor issue and has not been extensively tested. -- JulianYap (2006-06-04)

I believe this is the current problem with ACPI Sleep, and explains why I didn't notice it when you guys first did.
I was previously coming out of sleep by opening the lid.. it only fails when resuming with the power button.
Greg, if your problem seems to be a duplicate of this, please update your bug to reflect this.
-- Brandon Hale (2006-05-07)

I'm not so sure that is the same bug.  Some of my symptoms are similar, but I also have symptoms they don't.  It's a moot point right now anyway, as I can't seem to get my laptop to sleep on lid-close anymore.  The screen goes blank, and on lid-open stays blank until I switch to tty1 and back to X.  I assume it has to do with some of the recent updates.  I can tell it to sleep from the System Menu or the terminal, but I still have the problems I described in my bug report.
