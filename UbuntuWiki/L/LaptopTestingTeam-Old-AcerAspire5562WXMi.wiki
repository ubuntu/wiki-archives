==== Pros ====

* Installation was a breeze, fast and easy. (I used the Flight 7 dapper desktop installation)
* Centrino Duo works fine (install the linux-smp or 686 kernel packages)
* ATI 3D Acceleration works fine (using xorg-driver-fglrx 8.24.8)
* XGL/Compiz is running fine with some tweaks so it doesn't freezes
* The top of the screen is made entirely of Magnesium Alloy for lightness and resillient which gives it an extremely cool look also :)

==== Cons ====

* Gets a little hot sometimes on the keyboard, nothing out of the ordinary though.

==== Pictures ====

  Pictures I found on the net were for the 5672 model which have just about the same look, only with a bigger   monitor - a 15.4" WXGA.
