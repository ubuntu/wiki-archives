===== Lxmusic =====

===== Aqualung =====
<nowiki>[[http://aqualung.factorial.hu/ | Aqualung project]]</nowiki>
* I think this one is best suited for LXDE. It's simple, powerful, and lightweight. Written in pure C/gtk+ without additional desktop-dependent dependencies. (PCMan)
* John Thng: I have used and liked this player, as the sound quality output is excellent.

===== Gejengel =====
* This is yet another interesting music player. (PCMan)

===== Exaile =====
<nowiki>[[http://www.exaile.org/ | Exaile project]]</nowiki>
* Is it needed? I have not used it myself (Mario Behling)
* Thomas Chace: I tried it recently and it took forever and loads of CPU load to scan my library(14-15GBs). I eventually had to kill the process. Rhythmbox, however, wuickly scanned my library and was lighter on the CPU.
* David Sugar -1, between python dependencies and other things, it wanted to add over 170megs disk space to my minimal lxde install. I actually prefer Exaile over Rhytmbox, but not for Lubuntu at that cost :). 

===== Rhythmbox =====
<nowiki>[[http://projects.gnome.org/rhythmbox/ | Rhythmbox project]]</nowiki>
* we also have LXMusic included already (Mario Behling)
* David Sugar can we get LXMusic running? I imagine we can, and if so, then I agree with Mario... 

===== Consonance =====
<nowiki>[[https://sites.google.com/site/consonancemanager/Home | Consonance project]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~starfall87 | Shae Smittle]]</nowiki> suggests.
*** Similar interface to Rhythmbox
*** Developer left, may need to be branched by LXDE and updated there.

===== Asunder =====
<nowiki>[[http://littlesvr.ca/asunder/ | Asunder project]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~starfall87 | Shae Smittle]]</nowiki> suggests.

===== Audacity =====
<nowiki>[[http://audacity.sourceforge.net/ | Audacity project]]</nowiki>
* Do we need this?  It is not included in Ubuntu by default.
* In regards to the goal of making lubuntu a tool for people in countries/regions with low bandwidth access, it would be a nice thing to have in order to become an independent radio producer (Mario Behling)
