==== Notes ====
The Installation was done without Problems. The Graphic Card was automaticly detected. There were no errors.
W-Lan was installed perfect. I could connect with a network without a Problem.
Auto-Eth: The same easy plug and surf did work with wired Ethernet.
The microphone problem could be fixed with the alsa mixer. You have to select frontmic1,frontmic2 instead of  mic1,mic2. Put it to maximum volume and you can skype (-:

The sound problem is partial fixed with the ubuntu forums:
