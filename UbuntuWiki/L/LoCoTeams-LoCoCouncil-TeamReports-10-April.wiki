__TOC__

Laura chaired the meeting, and we used mootbot again. We discussed our agenda items,and asked Efrain Valles who had been dealing with Ubuntu El Salvador  for a update. 
Next agenda item was Leadership CoC not given to LoCo Leads this was brought to our attention via a bug and we have two outcomes from the meeting:
# LoCo council to review the terminology and better define the word team and report back 
# Look for more input from the loco contact list on "signing the Leadership CoC" which is what this was all about. 
Finally the last agenda item was about the new LoCo Health check which is being run on the 3rd Tuesday of the month in #ubuntu-locoteams

Mexico Team wasn't present and this will be taken to email for follow up
Brazilian LoCo was asked to come back with a more detailed wiki page for their application.

It was a marathon meeting which lasted 3 hours so thanks to all those who came and took part! you ROCK!
