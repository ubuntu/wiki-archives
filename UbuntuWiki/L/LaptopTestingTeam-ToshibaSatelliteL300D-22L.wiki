  Brand: Satellite

  Model: L300D-22L

=== Current Issues ===
The sound (Input and Output) does not work with Skype, even if it works fine with other programs.
The workaround is to uninstall pulseaudio and switch it with esound, as detailed here:
http://blog.rajatpandit.com/2008/11/15/skype-audio-playback-and-capture-problem-on-ubuntu-810/

Hibernate does not work out of the box. It can be fixed by debugging the DSDT, following the instructions given here:
http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1036051&page=15

The hotkeys to change the screen brightness do not work. I have not found any workaround for this.
