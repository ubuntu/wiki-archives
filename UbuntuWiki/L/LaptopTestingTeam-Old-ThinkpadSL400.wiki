==== Notes ====
1. IMPORTANT: The set of Build your own "RECOVERY" DVD's from LENOVO, when used, will ERASE EVERY SINGLE PARTITION on your harddisk and leave the computer as it came out of the factory. And it does so without an '''explicit''' warning, I guess the software engineers behind this program have a good sense of humor. 
2. I am getting freezes all the time when trying to wake-up the computer from ScreenSaver set to random with password lock
