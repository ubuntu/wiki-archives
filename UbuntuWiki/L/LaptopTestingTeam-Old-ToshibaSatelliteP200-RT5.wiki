=== Current Issues ===
-Cannot get webcam to work consistently

* -after fresh install, a pop-up suggests the battery may be under recall. A check of the Toshiba site doesn't list this model

* *-wireless network will not reconnect to encrypted router after hibernation. As a workaround I switch to "away" mode (enable roaming mode) then back to "home" mode
