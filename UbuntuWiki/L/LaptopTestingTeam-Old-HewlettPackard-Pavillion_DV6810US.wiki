==== Notes ====
Correct screen resolution was enabled after I attempted to enable Desktop Effects. The correct driver was downloaded and installed automatically.

Wireless initially did not work. I used the following tutorial to enable the installed wireless card. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=512828

Installation of nVidia Settings Manager makes cloning and extending of the desktop to external monitor effortless. (Package=nvidia-settings)
