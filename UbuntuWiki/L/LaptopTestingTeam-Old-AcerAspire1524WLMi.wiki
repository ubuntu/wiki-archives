* Make : Aspire
* Model: 1524WLMi
* Website: http://global.acer.com/products/notebook/as1520.htm
 
=== Current Issues ===
* It seems that Kubuntu doesn't handle ACPI, which causes a severe overheating problem. 
* The default screen resolution (1280x800) isn't automatically detected with the liveCD or the HD install. The user needs to edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf to enable it.
* There is less functionality offered by the Synaptic touchpad compared with Kubuntu 5.10. For example, the side scroll doesn't work.

==== Notes ====
* The tests were made with the i386 versions of Ubuntu ( NOT the AMD64 )

* Linux ACPI support for the Acer Aspire 1524 is broken which makes the computer do frequent emergency shutdowns while performing demanding CPU operations (compiling, gaming, etc...).
