=== Current Issues ===
The hard disc died (killed? It's only 2 weeks old.)  Unable to continue.

Update:  I replaced the Hard drive and it broke within a week.
I no longer own an MM20.  If anyone else wants to update this page please do.  Be careful with that hard drive though.
----
Dist-upgrade to Breezy was pretty un-successful.  The good news is that sound works better.  but there are still a lot of alsa underrun errors.

Netboot of the Breezy installer worked.  After bootstrapping and rebooting the machine my wireless nic (eth0) was now switched to eth1 and I had to manually change the config in /etc/networking/interfaces to get it to finish the install.  I get this at boot
<pre>
8139cp: pci dev 0000:00:0a.0 (id 10ec:8139 rev 10) is not an 8129C+ compatible chip
Try the "8139too" driver instead.
</pre>

X starts, the cursor is visible and movable, but GDM doesn't start.  I'm still looking through the logs for errors.

----
Looks like my FS got currupted, perhaps a bug in ext3 or LVM?

==== Notes ====
[1] You need to add i8042.nomux to the kernel string in grub to get the trackpad working.
