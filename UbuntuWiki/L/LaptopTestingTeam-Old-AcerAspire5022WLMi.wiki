=== Current Issues ===
The wireless nic doesn't work out of the box (the front panel key won't turn on the wireless). I don't know if it is possible to work, since at the moment I don't have time to make it work.

Euro sign key doesn't work.

Fn + F5 (external monitor or projector) doesn't work. However you can use ati catalyst control center to work with external monitor.
