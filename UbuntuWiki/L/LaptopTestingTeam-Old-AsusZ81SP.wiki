==== Notes ====
* To have frequenciy scaling of the Pentium4 add p4-clockmod to the /etc/modules list.  Powernowd will take advantage of the scaling abalities after this module is loaded.
* The wireless does work with the zd1211 driver but these drivers are qeustionable.  Doesn't work well with network monitor or WPA because the iwconfig interface is only avaliable when the device is up.  This causes problems with said applications.
* The laptop is not detected by the acpi4asus driver.  I wrote a patch for the newest CVS from the project.  I am unable to post it at the moment but I have both the patch and binaries that will load with ubuntu 2.6.15 kernel.  This patch allows use of most features provided by the acpi4asus project as well as the abality to turn on the bluetooth so it can be used.
