== Notes ==

=== Suspend ===

* Works generally, but sometimes it does not wake up.
* To not loose your wireless connection, add the name of the wireless driver to the MODULES entry in the file "/etc/default/acpi-support", so it is: MODULES="ipw3945"

=== Audio ===

The mixer (kmix) gets much more settings and the internal speakers mute when plugging a head phone, if you give the audio driver a hint concerning the model of your notebook: add the following line "options snd-hda-intel model=lg" to the file "/etc/modprobe.d/options” and restart (changing the option on a running system is possible but much more complicated). 

=== Wireless ===

I had stability problems with network managers dhcp, changed to WICD http://wicd.sourceforge.net/ and am happy
 
=== Card Reader ===

To use sd-cards with the build-in card reader, add the following lines to the file "/etc/modules" {{{
   tifm_sd
   tifm_7xx1
   tifm_core}}}

Driver homepage: xd cards are not working yet, http://tifmxx.berlios.de/

=== Issues with Dapper and Feisty ===

On Dapper and Feisty the screen resolution was not set and the LAN-card was not known by kernel drivers. These issues have been fixed in gutsy with the new xorg, the new intel graphics driver and the the lan-card automatically installed by restricted driver manager
