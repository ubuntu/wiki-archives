==== Notes ====

Works great in Ubuntu, was easier to install than Windows XP (on which I couldn't get the sound working, and it required me to have a USB-floppy drive and SATA drivers). It's running the 64-bit version of Ubuntu. WLAN worked "out of the box", and I use network-manager to switch between networks (lovely tool). I got 3D-acceleration to work just by installing nvidia-glx and enabling it.

When using fn + f4 to switch to external monitor, a new x-session is started and you can't switch back to the internal monitor (or use both at the same time).

XGL/compiz, and video out, is yet to be tested. 

The remote control shiped with dv6184ea worked fine out of the box!
