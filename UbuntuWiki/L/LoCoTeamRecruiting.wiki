== Recruiting Members For Your Ubuntu LoCo Team ==

How do you recruit an active and diverse group of people to work with on your !LoCo team?

==== Best Practices ====

* Host small sub-LoCo events to reach potential team members offline

* Make your team and resources easy to find online and define a clear way to join and contribute

* Actively use social tools (facebook, twitter, identi.ca)

* To ease contributing, make it clear that ''anyone can plan an event'' - just inform the team and ask for help as needed

* Form relationships with local tech groups, technically inclined non-profits and colleges and universities
