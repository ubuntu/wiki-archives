=== Current Issues ===
==== Wireless ====
Wireless occasionally fails. I think it's not working with WPA password. It will connect, but about 5-10 minutes later it stops working and must be reconnected by choosing the wireless network again. My solution was to not use WPA on my wireless network.

==== Sound ====
Sound did not work after clean instal of 9.04. This fix worked ( source https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/318942/comments/44 )

* Add ppa from https://launchpad.net/~minichoco-team/+archive/ppa
* sudo apt-get update
* sudo apt-get upgrade
* sudo apt-get install alsa-source module-assistant
* (optional) edit /etc/alsa/alsa-source.conf on line 11 you must have ALSA_CARDS="hda-intel" and this will reduce the compile time.
* sudo m-a a-i alsa-source # this will build and install automagically the audio card drivers
* sudo reboot

This will fix the sound, but will not save the sound settings upon reboot. To save sound settings after a reboot do this
( from http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntucat/vanilla-ubuntu-on-the-hp-mini-1120nr/ )

# Get the volume settings exactly the way you want them.
# Paste the command sudo alsactl store into the terminal.
# Edit the /etc/rc.local file as root (sudo nano -B /etc/rc.local) and then add in the line alsactl restore before exit 0
