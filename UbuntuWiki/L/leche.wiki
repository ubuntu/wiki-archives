I am 24 years old and studying biology. I discovered Ubuntu with the release of Feisty Fawn and invested a lot of time using and getting to know it better.

My primary contribution to Ubuntu is moderation and support in IRC and activities in the German LocoTeam.

== Summary of Ubuntu related activities ==
* Organizing the third german speaking Ubucon in October 2009 in Göttingen
* Organizing the second german speaking Ubucon in October 2008 in Göttingen
* Beeing Helper at the first german speaking Ubucon in October 2007 in Krefeld
* IRC Op and supporter in the german Ubuntu IRC channels (#ubuntu-de, #ubuntu-de-offtopic etc.)
* Helping alot of people arround me that have Problems with Ubuntu (aka rl-support ;))
* becoming member of the german IRC Op Team in 2008
* becoming member of the german Ubuntu association in 2008

== Ubucon Organisation ==
Helping out at Ubucon 2007 in Krefeld i found out that i really like working in the Ubuntu Community in this way. So when people where asked to contribute in the organisation of the Ubucon 2008 i tried to let the conference take part in the university i study at. After alot of talking and emails with the university officials we were allowed to arrange the Ubucon 2008 in Göttingen and i became member of the orga team. My part was to be the link between the rest of the orga team and the university, organizing all the stuff that can just be done locally (Food, local Helpers). In 2009 we again decided to let the Ubucon take part in Göttingen, my tasks stayed nearly the same. Due to my bachelor thesis  i will not have enough time to do that much work this year again but i will be at the conference and try to help where it is possible :)

== IRC Support ==
I am doing irc support since 2007 now, first of course just basic things but now i think with my knowledge i can help alot of users requesting for support.
In pure numbers i participated (wrote and was written to) a total of 

grep -R leche alte_irclogs/\#ubuntu* irclogs/freenode/\#ubuntu-* | wc -l

54265

lines in the ubuntu channels. 

Times people have said thank you to me: ;)

grep -RE '(danke leche)|((leche.*thx)|(leche.*danke))' alte_irclogs/\#ubuntu* irclogs/freenode/\#ubuntu-* | wc -l

510

But as numbers don't tell alot, here are a few examples of my work as a supporter:

== Future plans for my Ubuntu related activities ==

* I plan to keep doing the support online and offline
* I will also stay an IRC operator
* I will not be able to organize the Ubucon this year (study related) but i will be available as Helper. For the following years i will try to be part of the orga team again.

== Testimonials ==
KjellBraden: Ralph always did a great job in the german support channels. I remember him having extensive knowledge of the processes around Ubuntu. And he's a nice guy! :-)
