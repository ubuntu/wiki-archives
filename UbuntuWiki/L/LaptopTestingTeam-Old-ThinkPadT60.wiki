Install Issues (2.6.20-12-generic x86_64):
 - Disk Partition Step: Did not offer to resize the 100GB internal HD, only the external USB 250GB HD. Found that confusing. Had to go back into windows and manually partition, then select the manual option during installation.

 - First boot into windows XP after linux install gave me the blue screen of death...did not remain long enough to read what it said. No problems after rebooting to previous windows image. Could have been something I did. Who knows!

 - Everything else went very smoothly

Other Issues (2.6.20-14-generic x86_64):
 - The keyboard control for screen brightnes does not work correctly. Have not tried to trouble shoot yet. Screen goes blank with either "Fn-Home" or "Fn-End" keystrokes. Pressing either one three times in a row brings the screen back without any change to the brightness. Yet, the little box showing the screen brightness meter appears, but the meter does not change.

 - Sleep works intermittently. Can't find a pattern yet to replicate. The lid switch works, but waking up out of sleep doesn't always work. Following are order of operations on last attempt
<pre>
 - "Fn+F4" initiated sleep
 - Left lid open, did not close
 - Pushed power button to bring back
 - Screen blank
 - Hard drive "crunching" with hard drive light flashing
 - Sleep light flashing
 - Was able to reboot via pressing Ctrl-Alt-Del twice, so there was keyboard control.
 - Rebooted fine
 - Following from /var/logs/messages
