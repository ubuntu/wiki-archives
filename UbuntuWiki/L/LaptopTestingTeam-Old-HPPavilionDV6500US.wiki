=== Current Issues ===

If you have the Intel Wireless 4965AGN network adaptor and your using Ubuntu 8.10 you must install in the backports module or you will get frequent crashes when using wifi.  This is due to a bug in the linux driver, not the HP laptop.

==== Notes ====
 1. Has dedicated touchpad on/off key. Launches "Help" when turned off then on. Touchpad seems to be disabled for a time when switching users, or when X is restarted. Installing the Synaptic driver does not help. 11/26 - This seems to have been fixed in recent updates.

 2. The built in video adaptor was an Nvidia 8600m.

Wireless on/off switch works correctly.
This unit also has a remote with the media keys which most of the keys have correct functionality.

===== External monitor =====
S-Video port works fine

===== ExpressCard/54 =====
Also supports ExpressCard/34 cards

===== Hibernate & Sleep =====
Resumes from hibernate & sleep correctly.
