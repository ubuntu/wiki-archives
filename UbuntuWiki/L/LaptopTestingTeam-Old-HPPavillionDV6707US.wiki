==== Notes ====
1. In Gutsy, worked with reconfigure (NVIDIA graphics card). In Hardy, I had to download NVIDIA driver from website and install manually.
2. In Gutsy, kernel would crash when brought out of hibernation.
3. In Hardy (8.04), will not come out of hibernation (lapci problem?). Takes longish time to come out of suspend.
4. In Gutsy, when headphones were plugged in, sound would play on both headphones and regular speakers.
5. In Gutsy, does not work with restricted drivers. Does not work with Ndiswrapper. Worked with 32-bit gutsy and madwifi driver/patch. (processor is 64-bit).
6. In Hardy, 64-bit, works with ndiswrapper and 64-bit (windows xp) driver. Also works with new madwifi HAL, see http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=816780.
