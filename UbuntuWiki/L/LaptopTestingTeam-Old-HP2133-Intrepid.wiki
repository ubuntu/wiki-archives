=== How-To: Installing Ubuntu 8.10 from USB/SD Card on the HP 2133 Mini-Note ===

==== Pre-Boot ====

===== Installing from a USB/SD Flash Drive =====
  1.  If an external CD/DVD drive is unavailable, you can also install from a USB Flash Drive or SD Card.  The instructions below rely heavily on the instructions and converter file found on the <nowiki>[[http://www.pendrivelinux.com/2008/10/06/usb-ubuntu-810-install-from-windows-non-persistent/]]</nowiki> site and the previous how-to.  Many thanks to the talented people on that site and the previous author. Check on the <nowiki>[[http://www.pendrivelinux.com|PenDriveLinux]]</nowiki> site for updates if you encounter difficulties with the converter file.

1.  Ensure you have the following:

** A Windows PC to run the conversion program
** A downloaded copy of the Ubuntu 8.10 ISO image
** A 1GB or larger USB flash drive or SD Card
** <nowiki>[[http://www.pendrivelinux.com/downloads/Ubuntu810.exe|The PenDriveLinux converter file]]</nowiki>

1. Launch Ubuntu810.exe, which creates a folder named Ubuntu810. 

1. Place the Ubuntu 8.10 ISO file in the Ubuntu810 folder. Click on the Ubuntu810.bat file (also within the Ubuntu810 folder) and follow the onscreen instructions. This step takes a while and you can check its progress by viewing the size of the casper directory (in the root directory of the USB stick/SD card) which is just under 700MB once complete. 

1. Restart the computer and press F9, which will bring up the Boot Device menu. Select your USB flash drive or SD card and hit enter. 

==== Base Installation ====
1. At the Ubuntu install menu select the help option, which will bring up the Boot Options line. Type <I>live xforcevesa</I> and hit enter. The installer will then load the kernel and begin the installation process. It is normal for the progress bar to freeze for a short period of time. Have patience.

1. Eventually you should hear the welcoming sounds of Ubuntu through the Mini-Note's speakers, and see the Intrepid Live session desktop. Wireless and wired networking is available at this point, if necessary. Double-click on the "Install" icon and follow the wizard through the subsequent screens, selecting your location and keyboard layout.

1. Step 4 will ask you how you'd like to partition the disk. If you're comfortable with losing everything currently on the disk, select "Guided - use entire disk". Otherwise, choose the option that makes the most sense for you. Ubuntu works just fine sharing the drive with a Windows install, and it will even read and write to your NTFS partition out-of-the box. REMEMBER - If you choose the entire disk, you will kill everything else on your hard drive. BACK UP FIRST! Continue through the wizard, filling in your user information, password and computer name. When you're sure you're ready to make changes to your hard-disk, hit "Install" on the final page.

1. The "Installing System" dialog will come up next. Grab a tasty beverage and watch the progress bar slowly creep across the screen. When installation is complete, hit Restart Now. The installer will prompt you to eject the CD, so it is now safe to remove the USB stick/ SD card. Press enter to restart your computer. 

==== Video Driver Fix ====
There is extended info about the latest Via drivers and using external monitors here /DisplayConfig810. If you want to use Compiz or have full screen Flash working smoothly then you should try the latest Via 3D drivers - explained on /DisplayConfig810

With a fresh install of Ubuntu 8.10 the hp 2133 uses the wrong screen resolution. This can be fixed by editing your xorg.conf to look like this

The first file was made by copying select lines of the xorg.conf that was provided with the SUSE version of the hp 2133. To edit your xorg.conf:
* I recommend making a backup first. Press Alt F2 and type "gksu cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.bak" Press enter and type your password.
* Press Alt F2 again and type "gksu gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf" Press Enter. Type your password.
* Replace the existing configuration with the configuration above. Save and Exit.
* Restart Ubuntu to see the changes. 

Note: Upon restarting you may have to go into System > Preferences > Screen Resolution and manually select the size of 1280x768. (The native screen resolution)

The vesa driver works well for most tasks, however it does not support an external display. Via provides binary frame buffer (will not enable compiz effects) at <nowiki>[[http://linux.via.com.tw/support/downloadFiles.action| this site]]</nowiki>. Select Ubuntu 8.10 and download the package (desktop is fine).
* Right click the downloaded file and click "Extract here"
* Go into the newly extracted folder and right click via.ko. Select copy.
* Press Alt F2 and type "gksu nautilus". Press Enter. Type your password.
* Navigate to /usr/lib/xorg/modules/drivers and Paste the file in the directory.
* Close nautilus.
* Press Alt F2 and type "gksu gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf" Press Enter. Type your password.
* Edit "Driver" under the "Section Device" to read "via" instead of "vesa." Save and exit.

Note: Using the via driver without explicitly defining the screen modes and refresh rates results in strange cycling colours. However it does work with the xorg.conf as provided above.
