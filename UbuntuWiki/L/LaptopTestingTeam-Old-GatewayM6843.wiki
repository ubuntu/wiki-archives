==== Notes ====
Built in web-cam works.  
Amazed at how well everything "just worked".  Really only things that dont work are some multimedia keys
and the modem.  PCMCIA modems are cheap and you can assign any key in mplayer, vlc, etc, so no big deal on
keys. KDE 4.1 and Compiz work with full effects (same in GNOME).   VMWare runs awesome for Windows applications.
