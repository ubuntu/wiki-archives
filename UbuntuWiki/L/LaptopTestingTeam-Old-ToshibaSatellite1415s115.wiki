==== Notes ====

* This laptop plays better with Ubuntu than any other computer I've ever encountered.
* No integrated wireless, but you can get a broadcom 4318 wireless chipset setup pretty easily with this thread:
http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=197102.
* Hibernate works, but there are some funky graphical artifacts right before X goes up. Nothing serious. 
* Fn+F5 doesn't work insofar as returning to the laptop screen- the display gets corrupted into a repeating series of the first 120 or so pixels from the top down. Restarting X with ctl-alt-backspace seems to work.
