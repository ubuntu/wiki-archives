==== Notes ====

Hoary: 

** hibernate does not work with dri. i had to add "nomce" to the kernel commandline to make it work otherwise kernel panic on hibernate. Fixed with Linux abominox 2.6.12-7-k7 #1 Fri Aug 19 13:46:31 UTC 2005 i686 GNU/Linux - Kernel. (*)
** After the breezy (final) upgrades the 3D Accelerator support is broken. (**)
