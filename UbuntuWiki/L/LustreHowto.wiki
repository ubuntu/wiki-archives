== Start of Lustre Howto (WIP) ==

Lustre is a highly scalable redundant cluster filesystem that I started to play with because it seemed to best meet the highly available server setup I wanted (ability to restart virtual machines from one server to another)

tricky stuff about installing:

Under ubuntu 8.10 I found that you have to compile the lustre kernel modules yourself with module assistant, took me a bit to figure out.

will polish this more later as I figure it out :)

plan: have a setup for completely redundant two server configuration, with eventual setup having a copy of mdt/mds on every server and every ost being mirrored. lvm as backend for storage management on mdadm raided disks.
