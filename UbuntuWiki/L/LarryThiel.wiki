'''Ubuntu-Arizona Loco Team - The Hottest Lo``Co on Earth!'''

=== About Me ===

I am a retired programmer (C, C++, Assembler, Perl, Scripting) and Project Manager for the phone company and others.  I was an independent contractor for a few years doing multi-user database work back in the dBaseII and Optimum days.

My first exposure to *nix was to HP-UX 10 and 11 around 1985 at the phone company.  My group produced a Unix application that had to run 24x365 on multiple servers in different states with automated fail-over whenever needed.  My first exposure to Linux was later with Redhat Linux (prior to the swithover to Fedora and the emergence of RHEL).  I used it primarily for remote X into the company when I was called for support at 3 AM.  During this time I also spent 2 years on the ANSI XJ-311 C++ Standards Committee.  I met some truly amazing people there.

After I retired, I did not use Linux for a number of years.  Probably largely a direct result of my experiences with that early Redhat and the difficulty of doing many things.  When I tried Ubuntu Edgy Eft, I realized how far Linux had come and subsequest releases showed continual significant improvements for users and for installation procedures.  That tied it and I got started with local Linux groups.

I love SCUBA diving with nearly 800 dives to my credit.  I wrote a Divers Logbook program back in 1988 using C and assembler for MSDOS and still use it today though running it with DOSBOX under Linux.  I have been looking at !SubSurface ( http://subsurface.hohndel.org/ ) which was initiated by Linux Torvalds and currently maintained by Dirk Hohndel.  I recently made a proposal to add significant functionality to !SubSurface.

I currently lead, am an officer, or participate in 5 computer clubs 3 of which focus on Linux and FOSS and all of which discuss those things.

** PLUG - Phoenix Linux User Group
** SLUG - Sunland Linux User Group
** AZloco - Arizona Local Chapter of Ubuntu
** ccPDSE - Computer Club at Palmas del Sol East
** EVACC - East Valley Association of Computer Clubs
