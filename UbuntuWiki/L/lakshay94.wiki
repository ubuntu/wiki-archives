'''My Brief Introduction''': I am currently pursuing my Bachelors in Information Technology from USIT,Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University. I started using ubuntu from the ubuntu Lucid(10.04) and found it really good for doing programming specially and now use it as my main operating system on desktop and also on laptop. I want to join the ubuntu community and help improve ubuntu to do every possible job for which you have to turn to windows sometimes.
