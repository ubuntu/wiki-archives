==== Notes ====

===== About the sound issue =====

After the installation the sound won't work in the front speakers, only in the headphones jack. There is an easy way to fix this though. Run "sudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base" to open the config file and add the line in the end of the file: "options snd-hda-intel model=3stack probe_mask=1", and restart alsa by running "sudo alsa reload" or by restarting the computer. Now the sound should work both in the front speakers and in the headphone jack, the computer will also detect if you put headphones in the jack. (Note that I have a computer named l30-149, I assume it's the same computer as l30). Thanks to the forums for helping me with this!
