==== Notes ====
!!!! Currently In Development, !!!!

Any help would be appreciated.

=== Webcam ===
The Acer Orbicam finally works installing the latest gspca drivers which are downloadable from: <<BR>>
http://mxhaard.free.fr/download.html <<BR>>
I still don't know how to set a different resolution of the picture, but i'm working on it.

Gutsy: Could not get the orbicam working with gspca driver, but able to get it working with the uvcvideo driver downloadabled from: <<BR>>
http://mxhaard.free.fr/download.html <<BR>>
You'll also need to download luvcview from there to use with the driver. luvcview works with the command 'luvcview -f yuvy -s 800x600'. uvcvideo does not work with any of the traditional webcame programs like Ekiga or Camorama.

''Note'': Not all laptops have a built-in webcam, it depends on its market or release.

=== Card Reader ===

The card reader uses the ENE Technology Inc CB-712/4 Cardbus Controller chipset but currently no drivers have been found for this.

Gutsy: The card reader is detected and mounted automatically as expected.

=== Multimedia Keys ===

The multimedia keys work with the acerhk package downloadable from: <<BR>>
http://www.cakey.de/acerhk/ <<BR>>
The following line should be added to /etc/modprobe.d/options<<BR>>
options acerhk force_series=6000 poll=0<<BR>>

=== Compiz ===

Compiz is enabled by default in Gutsy. It works well with the exception of certain multimedia applications. The new intel driver bombs out when programs such as luvcview run with the error:<<BR>>
X Error of failed request:  BadAlloc (insufficient resources for operation)<<BR>>
To get rid of the error simply temporarily disable compiz by going to System->Preferences->Appearance->Desktop Effects and switch to "No Effects"

=== Modem ===

Ubuntu doesn't have the drivers for this modem.
Instead, the proprietary <nowiki>[[http://www.linuxant.com|Linuxant]]</nowiki> driver works correctly with Feisty Fawn. Actually, with Gutsy Gibbon (development version) that drivers doesn't load.
