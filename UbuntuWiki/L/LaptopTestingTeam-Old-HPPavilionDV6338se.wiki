=== Current Issues ===
7.04 In order to run this version, I had to use noapic and nolapic so that the system will not lock up when booting.    Unlocking the touchpad causes the help screen to appear.  Webcam works with libpt-plugins-v4l2 on 32-bit but unable to get it working on 64-bit.

On 7.10 you also need to use the noapic and nolapic options to kernel to boot. After the install is necessary to install the NVIDIA drivers manually and the wireless driver. There is a open bug related to a USB problem <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.20/+bug/123853]]</nowiki>.  Webcam does work with libpt=plugins-v4l2 on 64-bit.

With 8.04 64bits alternate CD (didn't try with desktop CD) I've got no more problens with the webcam and don't need to use any special parameters to the kernel on boot.
