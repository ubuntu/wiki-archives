Basic Installation of Ubuntu 7.10 Feisty Fawn

*** Installing

      Installing Ubuntu is streight forward however there ware problems with using the Preinstalled Vista partition resizing utility, basicly it hosed the vista installation. I would suggest if Dual Boot is To be maintained first make the full factory backup disc from within Vistsa/Acer empowerment. then remove the vista C and D partitions compleatly.MAKE SURE YOU DONT DELETE THE ACER RECOVERY PARTITION IF YOU EVER WANT TO REPLACE THE VISTA INSTALL. Then create a small 10 gig ntfs partition for vista and a 10 gig fat32 partition for the Acer eRecovery to work. I then made a 40 gig partition for linux and a 1Gig swap partition and then made the rest of the drive an EXT2 partition to share with vista.Below is a representation of my Drive Partitions
      RecF32 	VistaC_NTFS 	VistaD_F32 	ext3 / 	ext2 share 	swap

*** Post-Install modifications/tweaks

      After installation the only things i needed to tweak were bluetooth and the card reader. these simply needed a few lines placed in the modules file

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| #drivers for bluetooth
|-
| acerhk force_series=610
|-
| #drivers for card reader
|-
| tifm_7xx1
|-
| tifm_core
|-
| tifm_sd
|}

Setting up additional features for Ubuntu

*** Switching Bluetooth radio on/off

      The bluetooth radio and wifi radio buttons dont work. However there are commands in acerhk that turn the BT radio on/off.
      these are:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| echo on > /proc/driver/acerhk/blueled
|-
| echo off > /proc/driver/acerhk/blueled
|}

      however i wrote a simple bash script and thats activated with a launcher to toggle the radio off and on

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| #!/bin/bash
|-
| blueon='cat /home/holto/bin/.ledstate'
|-
| if [ $blueon = "0" ]; then
|-
| echo on > /proc/driver/acerhk/blueled
|-
| echo 1 > /home/holto/bin/.ledstate
|-
| else
|-
| echo off > /proc/driver/acerhk/blueled
|-
| echo 0 > /home/holto/bin/.ledstate
|-
| fi
|}
