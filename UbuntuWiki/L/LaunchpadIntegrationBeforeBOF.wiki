=== Implementation Plan ideas before BOF ===

In the short term, and in favor of making this happen by hoary, some of the std. libraries of GNOME
can be patched in order to include this functionalities as part of an application's "About" dialogues.
This would automatically make most of the desktop applications be "integrated" with about 2-3 centralized
patches, leaving relatively small number of applications that might inevitably need "local" patches due
to non standard usage of the about dialogues, using a flow oriented (i.e. Druids) GUIs or a complete
customized type of GUI.

For the long this may be an opportunity to stream line the way application developers define
and specify their preferred supportive frameworks, i.e. bug report systems, translation systems,
information pages and so on - which would ease derivatives and customized based distros work.

==== Short Term: ====

* Patch libgnomeui and gtk to include 3 buttons to open each launchpad service, from the std. about dialogs.
* Possibly create a configuration file for changing the URLs used for opening the relevant page on the portals, making it easier then changing the code each time launchpad locations and service names change.
* Patch remaining apps (non gtk/gnomeui clients).

==== Long Term: ====

Note: this is just an idea for the future maybe, with a thought to generalize this sort of application supportive desktop integration efforts.

* Create a library and an API that would provide support for an app to use a standard way  to "request"  those menu items and their attached actions.

* Complement the library with a conffile that would include details, per application / globally to instruct which bug tracker , translation portal / program / info pages to use for an app relative to the distro it's running on.

* Encourage the developers’ community to use that API, so to achieve a streamlined way to allow derived custom distributions to specify their preferred bug systems, translation portals, information pages and possibly make this API extensible to allow derivatives to add more functionality, as per their private infrastructures.

* This would make it trivial for distributors of desktop suits (Ubuntu as one) to customize this niche of the desktop, as well as spreading this functionality over all flavors of desktops, if this gets wide adoption by the community.

==== Research ====

This is the list of applications that are expected to have a launchpad integrated menu items, as they
are already using some kind of menu bars infrastructure and/or are visually interactive. (Compiled from the hoary current desktop seed list)

'''These applications link against one of the std. GUI libs in GNOME and are thus addressed by
centralized patching of the libraries:'''

'''Others:'''

* gnome-pilot-conduits - gnome-pilot related, needs further checkup.
* metacity - the window manager, doesn't have interactive gui?
* gdm - doesn't make much sense patching, user must be logged in order to start a browser...

'''Desktop GUI Apps that doesn't use gettext thus not translatable though Rosetta:'''

* openoffice.org
* mozilla-firefox

'''No GUI:'''
* gnome-volume-manager - a daemon.
* xscreensaver-gl
