==== Notes ====
The quickplay feature will still work as long as you don't delete the 1GB partition on installation.  It will be a choice in GRUB.  Also, when you hit the quickplay button to turn the computer on, it will simply start normal and you just choose it in grub.  If you are seeing this after the fact and need to restore quickplay, go to http://www.ubuntops.com for my contact info and I can send you a CD that reinstalls it.  I would also recommend making the recovery CD's before doing anything to windows since you may have to reinstall it for service from HP.

It works to my satisfaction most of the problems I had are gone with Edgy. It did introduce some new problems, but you can check out http://blog.ubuntops.com to see easy fixes for them.
