==== Notes ====

* Screen issues: if using opensource video driver, LCD panel may not work (at least radeonhd v 1.2.1-1.2.3 has these problems).
* 3D acceleration available only with proprietary fglrx driver for the moment.
* External monitor: works good when using opensource video driver (any usage scenario); not really usable with proprietary driver (fglrx), desktop can be mirrored or extended, but only with same resolution, as lcd panel.
* Wireless network controller doesn't work from livecd, because it requires firmware to be loaded, which isn't on cd because of licensing issues.
* Infrared device is "ITECIR Infrared Receiver" ITE8708, doesn't work OOtB, didn't find any mention if it works or not. I think, it is not. 
* Touchpad toggle can be enabled manually by adding Option "SHMConfig" "true" to appropriate section of xorg.conf (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SynapticsTouchpad for how to).
* Headphones connection doesn't disable speakers ootb. To fix this you need to add line ''options snd-hda-intel model=lenovo-ms7195-dig'' to ''/etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base''.
