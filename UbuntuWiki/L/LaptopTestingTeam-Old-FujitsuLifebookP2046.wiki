=== Current Issues ===
The machine has the ability to allow the OS to query and/or change the BIOS volume level, LCD screen brightness, etc. (basically all of the FN-key commands) via ACPI. At one point, there was a DSDT patch available to allow this, but it seems to not be maintained any longer. Links of interest:
* http://www.leog.net/fujp_forum/topic.asp?ARCHIVE=true&TOPIC_ID=2925 (patch for 2.4 kernel; the links are dead, unfortunately)
* http://www.leog.net/fujp_forum/topic.asp?ARCHIVE=true&TOPIC_ID=3388 (ditto as above but for 2.6)
