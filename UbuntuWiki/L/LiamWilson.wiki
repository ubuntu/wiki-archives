=== About Me ===

My name's Liam Wilson, and I'm a 17 year-old college student living in Liverpool, in the UK. I use 2 machines, both of which run Ubuntu 10.04, one of which is a Laptop with Desktop Ubuntu installed, and the other being a Netbook with an UNE/Meego dualboot. 

I've been running Ubuntu on and off from 7.10 "Gutsy" and then went the whole hog and installed 9.04, and have used Ubuntu ever since. After using Ubuntu for so long, I am now looking to become more involved in the community, and hope to help give that little something back to those who help bring Ubuntu to everyone. :-D

=== Community ===

* I'm a member of the Ubuntu UK LoCo, and help out on the mailing lists where I can.
* I'm looking at helping the Ubuntu UK LocO with ISO testing for 10.10 +
* I help out new users on the Ubuntu forums when I have time, usually during the summer.

=== Future Work ===

* Continue to become more involved in the Community
* Look for ways to help out projects in Launchpad
* Develop programming/technical skills.
