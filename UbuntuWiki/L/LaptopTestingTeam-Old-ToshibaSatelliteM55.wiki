=== Current Issues ===
Had many problems using "Install to Disk" app on 6.06 Desktop CD, after formatting sometimes did not recognize new partitions, locked up and closed, broke an NTFS partition on resizing. Fortunately, no data was lost.

Wireless configuration seems to be a tad buggy. If you go System>Administration>Networking and try to connect to a network that does not exist, the program sets up the hour glass and does not do anything. Then you have to close the application, but not force close.

When the screen dims when the shutdown button is pushed (upper right), the colors look a tad ugly. Perhaps not hardware but software.

Although install was slightly buggy, software worked out of the box. Good job. Will add more data when I have time.

Sometimes on unplugging the laptop, the battery icon does not change to the unplugged state. Or, if the laptop is booted without being plugged in, the icon shows that it is plugged in, but the tool tip says it is running on battery.

When the battery power goes critical, it does not do a soft shutdown. Is this normal?

If you switch to the second monitor and the aspect ratio is different (not widescreen), you are stuck with information going off screen.

If you switch to the second monitor when there is no second monitor attatched, the screen glitches. To fix, you can jump between TTY's (Ctrl+Alt+F1, Alt+F7). It would be nice to fix this.

Playing DVD's in Totem works, but the colors and contrast are wacky. This can be fixed manually with configuration.

==== Notes ====
Laptop has been working very smoothly from install. The only thing that does not work are the hotkeys, which seems to be a global problem.
