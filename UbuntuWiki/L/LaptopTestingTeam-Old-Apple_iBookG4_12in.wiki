==== Notes ====

AaronWaite: I had Hoary working on this machine fairly well when I first bought it. I quickly ran out of hard drive space on it's small 30GB drive and switched back to OS X exclusively. With the creation of the LaptopTestingTeam (and discovery that `parted` can resize `hfs+` partitions), I'm going to give Breezy a run on it and report my findings. 

I concur with all of Paul's findings. Sleep works great. For negatives, still no Airport Express support, and I don't have bluetooth to test. I have the external monitor dongle that Paul is missing, but I haven't found the documentation yet to get external monitor support to work. 

See ExternalMonitorIbook

RalphGlass: Breezy installed (replacing gentoo) and I am quite content. Lost my boot entry for OS X (Had not used it for over a year, so not an issue for me, but perhaps somebody else can advice for other people. (After one more year i decided to login to OS X once more - it was just a line to be added to yaboot.conf according to the comments in yaboot.conf. By the way the OS X login was lost time, I just wanted to give it a try before upgrading to Dapper Drake:-)

The fan control is working well. (The temp readouts are located in the /sys/devices/temperatures directory)

Overall i enjoy Ubuntu Breezy on my x86 Desktop and the ibook. It perfectly fits my professional needs as a teacher.

An external 800x600 beamer is used. Tip: Dont use xinerama, I just defined a second screen and device in xorg.conf. This way sleep is still working and a reasonable dvd peformance is easily achievable (16 bit depth, ogle). 

PaulSladen: Borrowed iBook.  Installed with Edubuntu 5.10 Preview branded disk.
