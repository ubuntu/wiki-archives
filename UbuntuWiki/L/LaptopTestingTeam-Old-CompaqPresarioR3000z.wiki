I customized mine online with an AMD64 processor at 1.8GHz, 784MB RAM (256MB factory, 512MB of my own), a GeForce4 440 Go 64MB graphics, Broadcom BCM4306 mini-PCI wireless, and all the chitsets are nVidia nForce.

All tests were done with the AMD64 version of ubuntu

=== Current Issues (as of Dapper Drake Flight 2) ===
* Suspend to RAM (sleep) goes to sleep but fails to wake. It starts to wake but after a while the Caps-lock starts flashing which I beleave means that it oopsed. Bug #<nowiki>[[http://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/show_bug.cgi?id=14657|14657]]</nowiki>
* The touchpad scrolling doesn't work.
* Touchpad does not work on resume from hibernation. Bug #<nowiki>[[http://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/show_bug.cgi?id=16740|16740]]</nowiki>
* The volume control buttons only work on X when the keyboard is not grabed. It would be nice to be able to use it while inside games and such.

==== Notes ====
Unlike other report of linux on the R3000 and R3000z I do not need to add any kernel params. Other had said they needed acpi=off and noapic to make the install finish. With the release of new kernels and drivers, I have never needed those.
