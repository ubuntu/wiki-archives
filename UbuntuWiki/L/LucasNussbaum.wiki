== Interests regarding Ubuntu ==

I am a long time Free Software and Debian user (since ~1998), developer and advocate. More than a year ago, I got the chance to beta-test what was by then called <nowiki>[[http://www.no-name-yet.com/|no-name-yet]]</nowiki>. I've been using and advocating Ubuntu since then. 

Inside Ubuntu, I work on :
* <nowiki>[[MOTU]]</nowiki> stuff : I see universe as an interesting problem of large scale quality management, and, apart from ''normal'' MOTU work, I try to improve the processes and write tools like <nowiki>[[MultiDistroTools]]</nowiki>. Ah, am I'm also working inside [MOTU/Teams/Ruby].
* DebianCollaboration : I think we should improve Free Software as a whole, not just the GNU/Linux distribution we are using. I started working on <nowiki>[[DCT]]</nowiki>, but this is stalled currently.
