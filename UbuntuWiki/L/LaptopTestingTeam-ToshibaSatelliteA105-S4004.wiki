=== Current Issues ===
Note:  Do not use text install cd, it cannot configure X and install fails by coming to a black screen and never leaving.
The desktop install cd is successful but you still have some X configuration issues from which the install cd recovers from.  
Remember to install the smp kernel after a successful install since this is a dual core system.
