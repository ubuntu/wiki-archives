=== Issues with Dapper (all resolved with Feisty) ===

The default audio channel is Front, so you have to unmute it. This is why you will have no sound at the beginning.

Trackpoint is unusable. It moves very slowly and you can not control it from sysfs (or at least i could not write in  /sys/devices/platform/i8042/serio0/serio2/speed for ex) also configure-trackpoing is mising from package tpctl http://tpctl.sourceforge.net/configure-trackpoint.html <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/tpctl/+bug/39620|bug39620]]</nowiki>

In order to make software suspend work for model with ATI video adapter you will need to use xorg fglrx driver.

The SD card reader works when you boot up with a card in the reader, but when you try to use it by inserting a card after booting it doesn't work. See <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+bug/53268|bug #53268]]</nowiki>

=== Notes ===

Since you have the hardware, can you confirm what keystrokes the Fn-Left/Right/Up/Down sequences produce and whether the suspend and blank (Fn-F3 and Fn-F4) keys are swapped. -PaulSladen

ALL (F1-F12,Left,Right...) function keys works. They produce an event and you can bind it to any action you want. - AdiRoiban
