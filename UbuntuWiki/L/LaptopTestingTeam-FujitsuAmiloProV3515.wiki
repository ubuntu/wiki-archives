=== Current Issues ===
Resolution is not properly recognized with installation of feisty. Should be 1280x800, but it's installed with only 800x600
Cooling fan is always running on full speed.
Attaching headphones does not mute the main speakers.

After switching wifi off using Wirelessswitch, turning it on doesn't work (switching network locations helps here).
Hibernate doesn't work.
Text console doesn't work after install (use vga=952 kernel parameter in /boot/grub/menu.lst).

==== Notes ====
^1^Resolution is not properly recognized with installation of feisty. Should be 1280x800, but it's installed with only 800x600. According <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixVideoResolutionHowto?action=fullsearch&value=linkto%3A%22FixVideoResolutionHowto%22&context=180]]</nowiki> 
Run the Autodetect Script Again
did a reconfigure of xserver sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg used vesa driver
restarted X and it worked. Don't know the 3d accel but that's for later questioning. agsamek: Works fine, use:

sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg

Select vesa and 1280x800 and restart the X server or reboot.

^2^Fan is running at full speed all the time. There´s is a workaround in <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=482900&highlight=AMILO+Pro+V3515]]</nowiki> ,did not checked if this works yet. agsamek: I've checked this and it works fine.
