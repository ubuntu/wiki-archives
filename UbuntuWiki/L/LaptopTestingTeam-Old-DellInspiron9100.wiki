3. 3D Acceleration enabled with current ATI drivers (as of 30 feb 2006)
4. Recovery from sleep doesn't reactivate screen (OK with last ATI driver)

==== Notes ====
With the '''ATI Mobility Radeon 9800 graphic card''', you could not launch the x-server because the default driver is unfunctionnal with it. So you could not launch Live-CD for installation. You must install Ubuntu with the ''Alternate CD'' and run in recovery mode for installed the proprietary driver '''''fglrx'' or last official ''ATI driver'''''.
