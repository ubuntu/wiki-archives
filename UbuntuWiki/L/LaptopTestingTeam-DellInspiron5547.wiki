=== Current Issues ===
I am using Ubuntu about a year. It works even better than on Windows, but I have one problem. My GPU (AMD RADEON R7 M265 2GB DDR3) does not work properly. After installation it runs integrated Intel Graphics and everything works fine... But GPU is more powerful than CPU. I have tried to install fglrx from repos, but it crashes the X Server while boot. Also I have tried official AMD drivers for mobile M2XX series GPUs, but when it's installed the performance even worse than on Intel Graphics (VSync problems, scroll hangs...).
