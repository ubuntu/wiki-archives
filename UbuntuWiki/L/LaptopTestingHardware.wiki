| I am willing to do regular testing of breezy install iso's /software in order to ensure that this laptop works out of the box.  Just email me the details of the testing needed, and will email back results in the next few days.  Details of my install and configuration woes are chronicled here: http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~weckerl/ferrari_ubuntu_64.html

| The DVD drive can be removed to add a new battery. It's supposed to be hot-swappable, but the kernel seems to crash when I remove it. I have a hotkey to disable the touchpad, but it seems it needs SHMConfig in the X config (synclient doesn't work without it). When the battery is charging, there's no way to know how much time it needs to be fully charged (might be a BIOS limitation).

| wireless card needed ndiswrapper + Dell Drivers (Dell Truemobile 1350 broadcom chipset - this laptop is also available with ipw2200 wireless, which should work out of the box).  Also needed BIOS setting changed to do a FULL post, rather than a fast post, or modprobing ndiswrapper hard freezes the machine in some situations.  ALPS touchpad works as ps/2 mouse, but no scrolling/etc.  To get fglrx to work, had to set MonitorLayout option to "LVDS, AUTO" in xorg.conf
