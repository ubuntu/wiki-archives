| State of LoCo Governance Docs
|}

Efrain suggested the revision of the docs in <nowiki>[[LoCoTeamKnowledgeBase#Running%20a%20Team]]</nowiki>
making sure that these docs are up to date with regards the new Leadership Code of Conduct. and Also document better the functions of the LoCo Council, what we do and how we interact with the LoCo Community, ie: Announcing LoCo team contact Changes, Team Approvals, and even newcommer teams. This makes the LoCo Council available to all teams at all levels.

| Tunisian LoCo as a legal entity
|}

<nowiki>[[nizarus]]</nowiki> asked about LoCo's as legal entities, he has already emailed the Community Council on this issue and the response has been to contact Canonical Legal for trademark permisions if they were interested, but they were also reminded that that legal entity would not be in anyway endorsed nor legally supported by canonical. Only trademark permission is provided. nizarus indicated that he has tried to contact Canonical Legal through the website form and Christophe mentioned that initial contact takes a while and he shared his experience with the french team as a legal entity.

Belarus has been around for quite some time but still needs to consolidate its resources and document and promote their achievements to the wider Ubuntu Community. They are making good progress. Belarus was asked to return once it has more experience.
