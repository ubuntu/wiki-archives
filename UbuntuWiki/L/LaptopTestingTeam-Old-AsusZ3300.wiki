==== Notes ====
Tested on Kubuntu 5.10.

Sound did not work. Everything seemed ok, the right modules loaded, applications were playing but no sound came out. I then compiled a kernel 2.6.14.5 from kernel.org and sound worked fine. Now wireless indicator does not work and suspend of ipw2200 gives kernel OOPS.
