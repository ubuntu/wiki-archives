=== Notes ===

 1. Info about older releases copied from <nowiki>[[LaptopTestingTeam-ThinkpadSL400]]</nowiki>.
 2. Horisontal scrolling has to be enabled in System -> Preferences -> Mouse -> Touchpad.

=== Getting hotkeys to work ===

The <nowiki>[[http://github.com/tetromino/lenovo-sl-laptop/tree/master|lenovo-sl-laptop]]</nowiki> driver enables the volume buttons and most of the Fn+ hotkeys, and fixes the brightness controls. See <nowiki>[[http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/SL_Driver_on_Ubuntu|this page]]</nowiki> on ThinkWiki for installation instructions.

Following are my observations of what does and doesn't work after installing the driver (in Ubuntu 9.04):
 1. volume up, down and mute keys work
 2. Lenovo Care button doesn't work
 3. Fn+Esc (Break) doesn't work
 4. Fn+Space (magnify) doesn't work
 5. Fn+F1 (SysRq) doesn't work, launches the Save Screenshot app instead
 6. Fn+F2 (lock screen) works
 7. Fn+F3 (power options) doesn't work
 8. Fn+F4 (sleep) works
 9. Fn+F5 (toggle wireless) doesn't work
 10. Fn+F6 (print screen) works, launches the Save Screenshot app
 11. Fn+F7 (toggle display) seems to work (display flashes, haven't tested with external monitor yet)
 12. Fn+F8 (UltraNav) doesn't work
 13. Fn+F9 (EasyEject) ejects optical drive
 14. Fn+F11 (Pause) - not sure how to test this. Suggestions?
 15. Fn+F12 (hibernate) works
 16. Fn+Insert (Scroll Lock) doesn't work
 17. Fn+Delete (Num Lock) works
 18. Fn+Home (decrease brightness) works
 19. Fn+End (increase brightness) works
 20. Fn+PageUp (back) and Fn+PageDown (forward) both work
 21. Fn+arrow keys all work
