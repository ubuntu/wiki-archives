=== Current Issues ===
There are issues with hibernate when using the non-free nvidia xorg modules. Using 'nv' makes everything work without issue, or just switch to a VC and back to get a working X after resuming from hibernate.

Suspend seems to work fine with either free or non-free modules.

There is also a problem with blank VC's at boot. Looks like a duplicate of bug <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/nvidia-glx/+bug/32389|#32389]]</nowiki>

The above relate to Dapper only. Suspend and hibernate work flawlessly on Edgy (15-Oct-2006), and VCs display as expected.
