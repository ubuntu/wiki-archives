=== Notes ===
==== Initial installation ====
* Although this is a 64-bit system, tests were performed using i386.
* If using Feisty/Gutsy, before starting the installer add <code>noapic</code> to the kernel options

==== Sound ====
There are two headphone jacks of which one is also S/PDIF. None of them works out of the box.

The chipset used is Realtek ALC861-VD. After going through many online resources, Hardy alpha 4 already comes with the alsa drivers many recommend to download & compile manually - so no need to install anything. Adding ''either'' of the following to /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base worked for me: 
<code>options snd-hda-intel model=hp</code>
or
<code>options snd-hda-intel model=3stack-dig</code>

The docs at <code>/usr/share/doc/alsa-base/driver/ALSA-Configuration.txt</code> (after gunzipping the file) confirmed these two options should word, since this laptop does have 3 jacks:
<pre>
        ALC861VD/660VD
[...]
          3stack-dig    3-jack with SPDIF OUT
[...]
          hp            HP TX1000
[...]
</pre>

I also noticed a hissing sound in the headphones once they worked. I was able to make it go away by muting the "Front Mic" volume control.

==== LCD Screen buttons ====
None of the buttons on the LCD screen side work out of the box. It's interesting to note QuickPlay used to be powered by a Linux partition that would start very quickly and play audio, video and DVDs. The latest versions run on Windows and required a full OS boot.

Mapping them to commands in Ubuntu (like screen rotation) requires knowing their scancodes, creating commands in metacity and mapping such scancodes to the commands.

Here is blue-lighted keys description and their scancodes (N/A if none generated):

|-
| 4
| N/A
| DVD button
| Launches the DVD playback feature of the <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickPlay|QuickPlay]]</nowiki> program.
|}

There are also media buttons on the side, behind the LCD screen. Here is their description and scancodes:

<nowiki>[[File:media_screen_buttons.png]]</nowiki>

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| 1
| Previous/rewind button
| Plays the previous track or chapter when the button is pressed once. Rewinds media when the button is pressed simultaneously with the fn key.
|-
| 2
| Play/pause button
| Plays or pauses media.
|-
| 3
| Next/fast forward button
| Plays the next track or chapter when the button is pressed once. Fast forwards media when pressed simultaneously with the fn key.
|-
| 4
| Stop button
| Stops playback.
|}

The only key I was able to map to an application (rotate script) was the "Media Button" (#3 of the blue keys). See:
* <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MultimediaKeys|Mapping multimedia keys in Ubuntu]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=4854026&postcount=920|Post on the tx1000 thread in Ubuntu forums]]</nowiki>

==== Webcam ====
The webcam work out-of-the box, this may help make it visible to applications using the gstreamer back-end:
# Press Alt+F2, type gstreamer-properties and click execute.
# In the opened window go to the ''Video'' tab.
# Select ''V4L2'' as input plugin and ''USB 2.0 camera'' as input device. 

==== Touchscreen ====
* '''Screen input''': Although there are binary drivers for this specific touchscreen, I have not been able to make them work with Hardy. Will be posting existing docs later on.
* '''Character recognition''': <nowiki>[[http://risujin.org/cellwriter/|CellWriter]]</nowiki> seems to be the application for character recognition. Starting with Ubuntu 8.04 it is part of the universe repository so it can be installed via standard tools (like synaptic or apt).
