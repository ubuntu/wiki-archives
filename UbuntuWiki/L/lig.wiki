Welcome, who ever you are!

 My name is Serge Matveenko (ru: Сергей Матвеенко) aka lig. I'm from Saint-Petersburg, Russia. I'm one of the many Ubuntu participators from all over the world. Ubuntu Linux was the first Linux distribution I ever used. This was in early 2006 when I was working with <nowiki>[[Andrey Mavlyanov|Aim]]</nowiki> who gave me my first Ubuntu Dapper Drake Beta CD. From that time I've tried some other distributions and have built Linux From Scratch a couple of times. My lifestyle now is to spread Ubuntu all around. My wife uses Ubuntu, a number of my friends use Ubuntu, even my Mom uses it too.
