=== Course Assignment ===

Courses in the UCLP are currently given on a "first come first serve" basis.

For each major topic we cover, we have a wiki page outlining core topics and linking to existing documentation, ie <nowiki>[[Learning-UbuntuDesktopTopics]]</nowiki>

The process for "adopting" a course is as follows:

 1. Review the topic wiki page

 1. If a topic interests you, put your name next to it (link to your wiki or launchpad page), a date, and possibly a link to the "in progress" documentation.

** For instance, if you wanted to write the class on "Basic Office Applications" you may edit the wiki to say:

** Basic Office Applications - <nowiki>[[lyz|Elizabeth Krumbach]]</nowiki> writing, 01/28/2010, <nowiki>[[https://code.launchpad.net/~lyz/ubuntu-learning-materials/learning|bzr branch]]</nowiki>

 1. Start writing your class!

** <nowiki>[[Learning-CourseLayout|Course Layout]]</nowiki>
** <nowiki>[[Learning-CourseDevelopment|Course Development]]</nowiki>

Please join #ubuntu-learning or ask on the <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-learning|Ubuntu Learning mailing list]]</nowiki> if you have any questions!
