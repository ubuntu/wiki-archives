<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 01:30:30] seidos, got your program 2 going?
<seidos>	[Jun 26 01:30:38] hey pedro3005 is it 1:30 in rio de janero?
<seidos>	[Jun 26 01:30:38] crappy
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 01:30:46] seidos, 2:27
<seidos>	[Jun 26 01:30:57] hmmm 4 hours, not 3
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 01:30:58] I should get sleep, I gotta be at school by 8 AM
<seidos>	[Jun 26 01:31:02] 4 is the official random number
<seidos>	[Jun 26 01:31:10] you have school on sat?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 01:31:21] not every saturday, just this one
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 01:31:25] it's actually a test
<seidos>	[Jun 26 01:31:27] I see
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 01:31:39] a simulation of college entry tests
<seidos>	[Jun 26 01:31:52] good luck
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 01:32:02] I generally do very well in these
<seidos>	[Jun 26 01:32:17] and it's just a simulation
<seidos>	[Jun 26 01:32:22] nothing too stressful
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 01:32:25] but it's worth points in your grade
<seidos>	[Jun 26 01:32:30] ah
<seidos>	[Jun 26 01:32:38] that's smart, we didn't have that when I was going to school
<seidos>	[Jun 26 01:32:42] at least, not that I attended
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 01:32:45] if it didn't, I wouldn't even attend
<seidos>	[Jun 26 01:33:44] man it sucks when you think you're done with a program and find out you didn't meet all the requirements
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 01:33:56] which one did you miss?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 01:34:40] let me see if I still have my code
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 01:34:49] nope
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 01:34:58] I'll do it in python just for fun
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 01:35:08] it'll be refreshing
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 01:39:24] Snova, are you there?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 01:43:06] seidos, hey, I made a very cool Python function
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 01:43:11] now problem 2 looks easy
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 01:43:18] it uses recursion
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 01:43:25] but I'd like to do it in fewer lines
<seidos>	[Jun 26 01:44:06] I need to reject spaces as an input
<seidos>	[Jun 26 01:44:12] age has to be greater than 0
<seidos>	[Jun 26 01:44:25] and...
<seidos>	[Jun 26 01:44:32] userid has to have a max
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 01:47:06] seidos, let me see your code
<seidos>	[Jun 26 01:48:26] pedro3005, http://paste.ubuntu.com/455321/
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 01:49:13] seidos, char quit[4] = "quit";  -> wrong
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 01:49:42] first, you'd have to do:
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 01:49:55] char quit[5];  (remember to account for '\0')
<seidos>	[Jun 26 01:50:06] hmmm, interesting
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 01:50:06] strcpy(quit, "quit");
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 01:50:12] and second
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 01:50:14] you don't need this
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 01:50:17] just do
<seidos>	[Jun 26 01:50:20] but it works
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 01:50:28] strcmp(name, "quit");
<seidos>	[Jun 26 01:50:30] when I type "quit" it closes the program
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 01:50:36] odd
<seidos>	[Jun 26 01:51:01] indeed
<seidos>	[Jun 26 01:51:01] compile it and see
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 01:51:22] the name can have spaces
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 01:51:27] just the first char must not be one
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 01:51:37] scanf("%s", name);
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 01:51:43] wrong
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 01:51:52] scanf("%s", &name);
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 01:52:04] I think
<seidos>	[Jun 26 01:52:07] why?
<seidos>	[Jun 26 01:52:29] I'm not sure if & will compile, but I got scanf("%s", name); from an example I saw on the web
<seidos>	[Jun 26 01:53:02] yeah, if I put & it doesn't compile
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 01:53:21] well then I'm wrong
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 01:53:46] god, I wish I still had my code for this
<seidos>	[Jun 26 01:54:25] my problem now is just checking for the space
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 01:54:38] isspace(name[0])
<seidos>	[Jun 26 01:54:41] not sure how I'm going to do the > 0 check on a string
<seidos>	[Jun 26 01:55:21] the other problem is, if there is a space, how do I go back to receiving input?
<seidos>	[Jun 26 01:55:36] I'm trying to avoid a goto
<seidos>	[Jun 26 01:55:38] so I think a loop
<seidos>	[Jun 26 01:55:51] but I tried a loop but it doesn't make sense
<seidos>	[Jun 26 01:55:54] I thought you were going to sleep?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 01:55:58] oh, I know, I could try looking at the logs
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 01:56:01] screw sleep
<seidos>	[Jun 26 01:56:16] what include file do I need for isspace?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 01:56:22] ctype.h
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 01:56:34] seidos, what do you think of this Python solution? http://paste.pocoo.org/show/230112/
<seidos>	[Jun 26 01:57:16] oh no, python
<seidos>	[Jun 26 01:59:11] output doesn't meet the requirements
<seidos>	[Jun 26 01:59:15] You are  , aged 0. Next year you will be 1. Your forum ID is 10000000000000000000000, the next user is 10000000000000000000001
<seidos>	[Jun 26 01:59:43] it still looked cool though
<seidos>	[Jun 26 01:59:50] the code didn't really make sense when I looked at it
<seidos>	[Jun 26 01:59:53] I don't remember much from python
<seidos>	[Jun 26 02:00:03] for some reason, c is making more sense than python to me
<seidos>	[Jun 26 02:00:17] I remember "import math"
<seidos>	[Jun 26 02:00:18] :p
<seidos>	[Jun 26 02:00:21] that's about it
<seidos>	[Jun 26 02:00:23] pedro3005, ^^
<shankar>	[Jun 26 02:00:33] hey seidos
<seidos>	[Jun 26 02:01:21] hey shankar
<shankar>	[Jun 26 02:01:21] ah bgs000 left?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 02:01:23] seidos, ok, it'll have to be bigger
<seidos>	[Jun 26 02:01:27] yeah
<shankar>	[Jun 26 02:01:40] seidos: this is mohi :P
<seidos>	[Jun 26 02:02:09] oh, hi mohi :D
<shankar>	[Jun 26 02:02:15] lol
<shankar>	[Jun 26 02:03:58] linguastic session is over???
<seidos>	[Jun 26 02:04:20] well...now maybe we're just working on computer linguastics :P
<shankar>	[Jun 26 02:04:30] ahha
<seidos>	[Jun 26 02:04:50] I'm drawing a blank
<shankar>	[Jun 26 02:05:03] wut?
* seidos [Jun 26 02:05:05] doesn't know how to improve his program further
<shankar>	[Jun 26 02:05:34] seidos: what program??
<seidos>	[Jun 26 02:05:49] I'm working on the 2nd beginners problem
<shankar>	[Jun 26 02:05:51] pastebin it :D
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 02:05:51] seidos, it now meets requirements http://paste.pocoo.org/show/230114/
<seidos>	[Jun 26 02:05:59] wow, that was fast
<shankar>	[Jun 26 02:06:36] lol its not opening here :D
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 02:06:46] :/
<shankar>	[Jun 26 02:07:01] opened
<shankar>	[Jun 26 02:07:14] ok what you are trying to do with that? any errors?
<seidos>	[Jun 26 02:07:18] shankar,  http://paste.ubuntu.com/455321/
<shankar>	[Jun 26 02:08:29] seidos: what you wanna move furter on it?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 02:08:56] seidos, I am absolutely positive char quit[4] = "quit"; is wrong
<seidos>	[Jun 26 02:10:55] pedro3005, you didn't add the "exit" or "quit" escape
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 02:11:10] seidos, god damn it
<seidos>	[Jun 26 02:11:10] and you're right, it should be "exit" not "quit"
<shankar>	[Jun 26 02:11:11] seidos: what you wanna clarify man!!!!!
<seidos>	[Jun 26 02:11:31] shankar, oh.  I need to know how to implement the requirements:  age needs to be > 0
<seidos>	[Jun 26 02:11:48] userid cannot be negative or 0 either
<seidos>	[Jun 26 02:11:54] and username can't have spaces
<seidos>	[Jun 26 02:12:32] I think I did this one in python
* seidos [Jun 26 02:12:39] checks to see if he has the code
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 02:12:41] seidos, well, that requirement completely kills my program
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 02:12:43] good job
* pedro3005 [Jun 26 02:12:49] begins crying
<seidos>	[Jun 26 02:12:53] pedro3005, what requirement?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 02:13:04] seidos, quit
<Snova>	[Jun 26 02:13:04] someone pinged me (again)
<seidos>	[Jun 26 02:13:15] Snova, it wasn't me
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 02:13:16] me
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 02:13:33] Snova, what do you think of http://paste.pocoo.org/show/230115/ ? (solution to challenge no. 2)
<seidos>	[Jun 26 02:13:44] why does star trek: tng look so stupid now?
<seidos>	[Jun 26 02:14:02] I used to love that show, but now I just can't watch it
<Snova>	[Jun 26 02:14:35] exec is completely unnecessary
<Snova>	[Jun 26 02:15:05] except: is extremely poor practice and not doing much good here
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 02:15:27] :/
<Snova>	[Jun 26 02:15:49] the first can be replaced by passing actual type objects to ask and then executing "return return_type(raw_input(question))"
<seidos>	[Jun 26 02:15:56] ah, I used a while True loop in python, maybe I can do that in C somehow
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 02:16:07] you can do that?
<Snova>	[Jun 26 02:16:10] the latter by catching ValueError
<Snova>	[Jun 26 02:16:12] yes
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 02:16:21] seidos, while (1) { //stuff }
<Snova>	[Jun 26 02:16:35] I assume that except: is there to catch invalid input; str() will never do that and int() raises a ValueError
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 02:18:40] Snova, well, how to avoid except?
<shankar>	[Jun 26 02:20:34] seidos and pedro3005 you know that we can pass parameters in the main function of C program??
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 02:20:57] yes
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 02:21:06] int argc, char** argv[] right?
<shankar>	[Jun 26 02:21:19] yep :)
<shankar>	[Jun 26 02:21:43] its a single pointer char *argv[]
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 02:22:02] ah ok
<seidos>	[Jun 26 02:23:34] what use is it?
<seidos>	[Jun 26 02:23:48] shankar, ^^
<seidos>	[Jun 26 02:27:30] this isspace isn't working
<seidos>	[Jun 26 02:27:37] I need to find out a way to check for spaces
<seidos>	[Jun 26 02:27:46] I'm stumped
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 02:28:06] seidos, oh, I remembered - in my code, I used a do-while loop
<seidos>	[Jun 26 02:28:23] I think a while (1) will work
<seidos>	[Jun 26 02:28:28] I can use continues and breaks
<seidos>	[Jun 26 02:28:39] but I don't know how to check for the space
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 02:28:43] do { //execute once } while ( //if conditions meet, iterate again);
<seidos>	[Jun 26 02:29:28] introduce the do while loop will just bring me farther from finishing this project
<seidos>	[Jun 26 02:29:34] I'll try a do while loop some other type
<seidos>	[Jun 26 02:29:37] that isn't my problem
<seidos>	[Jun 26 02:29:41] my problem is checking for the space
<seidos>	[Jun 26 02:29:51] here's what I'm doing now, that isn't working Give your name: exit
<seidos>	[Jun 26 02:29:51] Give your age: quit
<seidos>	[Jun 26 02:29:51] Give your age: exit
<seidos>	[Jun 26 02:29:51] Give your age: quit
<seidos>	[Jun 26 02:29:51] Give your age: exit
<seidos>	[Jun 26 02:29:52] Give your age: exit
<seidos>	[Jun 26 02:29:54] Give your age: quit
<seidos>	[Jun 26 02:29:56] Give your age: exit
<seidos>	[Jun 26 02:29:58] Give your age: quit
<seidos>	[Jun 26 02:30:00] Give your age:
<seidos>	[Jun 26 02:30:02] oops!
<seidos>	[Jun 26 02:30:03]                 else if (isspace(name[0])){
<seidos>	[Jun 26 02:30:07]                         printf("No spaces please.");
<seidos>	[Jun 26 02:30:09]                         continue;
<seidos>	[Jun 26 02:30:11]                 }
<seidos>	[Jun 26 02:30:13] that's what I meant to do
<seidos>	[Jun 26 02:30:17] let me try something to double check
<seidos>	[Jun 26 02:30:54] yeah, break doesn't exit the loop
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 02:30:58] int hasSpace (char *array, int size) { int i; for (i = 0; i < size; i++) { if (isspace(array[i])) return 1;} return 0; }
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 02:31:02] I think this should work
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 02:32:09] seidos, alright, I'm going
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 02:32:13] good night
<seidos>	[Jun 26 02:32:16] good night
<shankar>	[Jun 26 02:34:57] seidos: http://publications.gbdirect.co.uk/c_book/chapter10/arguments_to_main.html
<seidos>	[Jun 26 02:36:30] shankar, thanks
<shankar>	[Jun 26 02:37:13] =]
<shankar>	[Jun 26 03:29:22] seidos: you are there??
<shankar>	[Jun 26 03:29:29] duanedesign: ping
<duanedesign>	[Jun 26 04:04:10] hello shankar
<shankar>	[Jun 26 04:06:12] duanedesign: hi
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 15:40:02] bgs100, how do I use SQL in C?
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 15:45:08] pedro3005, ...
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 15:45:41] bgs100, I need it for the beginners challenge
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 15:45:50] Uh
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 15:45:57] pedro3005, Does it say "SQL"?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 15:46:07] no
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 15:46:15] Okay then
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 15:46:28] Link?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 15:46:34] it says "database" but mentions "SQL" somewhere along the thread
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 15:46:45] Okay then
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 15:46:55] SQL is a big fancy relational databaseamijgger
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 15:47:05] You probably don't need it.
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 15:47:16] In answer to your question, presumably 3rd parties libraries or lots of input/output to commands.
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 15:51:32] okay
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 15:51:38] bgs100, then what should I use?
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 15:51:54] Class hasn't started :P
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 15:53:06] Honestly
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 15:53:19] I haven't done very much with databses in C.
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 15:53:26] And you haven't given me a link.
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 15:55:46] bgs100, http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=5926632
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 15:56:59] Well, you may have to find out for yourself; google, asking other people, etc.. For now, anyway
<mohi1>	[Jun 26 16:36:35] pedro3005, The SQLite library is designed to be very easy to use from a C or C++ program, says a link
<mohi1>	[Jun 26 16:36:37] http://www.sqlite.org/c_interface.html
<mohi1>	[Jun 26 16:37:18] bgs100, is he dead??
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 16:37:32] mhm
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 16:37:37] killed by those databases
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 16:37:41] gotta watch em close
<mohi1>	[Jun 26 16:37:51] lol
<mohi1>	[Jun 26 16:37:56] l
<mohi1>	[Jun 26 16:38:01] k*
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 17:27:18] mohi1, back
<seidos>	[Jun 26 17:27:24] greetings
<mohi1>	[Jun 26 17:27:45] hey pedro3005. saw those links??
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 17:27:50] mohi1, I will, thanks
<mohi1>	[Jun 26 17:27:55] =]
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 17:28:20] mohi1, but they're all about C++
<mohi1>	[Jun 26 17:28:36] <mohi1> pedro3005, The SQLite library is designed to be very easy to use from a C or C++ program, says a link
<mohi1>	[Jun 26 17:28:41]  C or C++ program
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 17:29:17] mohi1, which link?
<mohi1>	[Jun 26 17:29:26] <mohi1> http://www.sqlite.org/c_interface.html
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 17:29:32] oh ok
<Snova>	[Jun 26 18:05:44] sqlite is written i C
<Snova>	[Jun 26 18:05:45] in*
<Snova>	[Jun 26 18:06:02] it's also not much fun no matter how you go about it; why are you doing this again?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 18:07:02] beginners challenge
<Snova>	[Jun 26 18:07:44] none of them require it (except one of LaRoza's)
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 18:07:51] exactly
<Snova>	[Jun 26 18:08:04] I see
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 18:08:15] and well, databases are a part of programming.. I should learn it one day or another
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 19:35:18] Snova, what does something like string[::-1] do in Python?
<Snova>	[Jun 26 19:36:10] pedro3005: reverses it
<Snova>	[Jun 26 19:36:15] can't talk; busy
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 19:36:19] ok
<Snova>	[Jun 26 19:37:02] slicing syntax is start:stop:step
<Snova>	[Jun 26 19:37:17] if it were ::2 I think it'd grab every other character
<Snova>	[Jun 26 19:37:27] instead, -1 has it traverse the string backwards, but grabbing every one, thus reversing it
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 19:46:09] I see
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 19:46:32] Snova, on a side note, I'm trying to do this in C: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1407897
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 19:46:50] my program manages to sum the digits but I have no idea on how to count the character occurrence
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 19:49:12] or are you still busy?
<Snova>	[Jun 26 19:51:42] yes, just off and on as I lose/don't lose
<Snova>	[Jun 26 19:52:28] pedro3005: there's a fairly simple way to do it; keep a table of each char- 256 items long
<Snova>	[Jun 26 19:52:35] the char itself can be used to index it
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 19:52:42] 256?! don't you mean 26?
<Snova>	[Jun 26 19:52:45] no, 256
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 19:52:58] why?
<Snova>	[Jun 26 19:52:59] there's more than just letters, isn't there?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 19:53:14] in the challenge, it says it'll be either digits or lowercase letters
<Snova>	[Jun 26 19:53:17] one byte (char) has 256 values and this way you don't have to do anything special, like converting 'a' to 1
<Snova>	[Jun 26 19:53:26] then even you're wrong; it's 36 :p
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 19:53:47] but you don't have to count the occurrence of digits
<Snova>	[Jun 26 19:54:08] *shrug* however you like; it's what occurred to me
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 19:54:47] I'll just make a list with 26
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 19:57:36] bgs100, there?
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:11:42] YES!
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:12:12] Hi pedro3005!
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:12:34] The black holes got sedios again?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 20:12:41] he said he was going to the store
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 20:12:49] 1 and a half hour ago
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:12:51] oh
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:12:54] hm
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:12:55] Wlel
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:12:57] Well*
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:13:03] WE SHALL START THEN.
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 20:13:10] bgs100, what does islower_l do? it's not in the manpage (only islower)
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:13:17] Wait
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:13:42] ............................................;;;:::""""""" MAY THE CLASS BEGIN!!! """""":::;;;.............................................
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:13:51] pedro3005, Where did you see this function?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 20:13:58] at the drop down menu
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:14:24] er
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:14:28] what?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 20:14:46] the one that appears when I start typing stuff
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 20:14:47] on my
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 20:14:48] IDE
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:14:57] hm

<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:15:12] Ah...
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:15:19] http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/islower_l.html
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:15:28] The second link is more helpful
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:16:00] It's marked "CX"
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:16:04] "[CX] [Option Start] Extension to the ISO C standard [Option End]"
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:16:11] There you go.
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 20:16:56] ? still don't get it
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:17:13] It's an extension to the standard library.
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 20:17:23] but what's the difference?
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:17:42] Uhm
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:17:50] One tests for a certain "locale"
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:18:01] Read this:
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:18:02] http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap07.html#tag_07
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 20:18:20] oh ok
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 20:18:21] go on
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:18:27] :p
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:18:49] pedro3005, If we're done with islower_l, you go on.
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 20:18:56] go on to what?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 20:19:22] spanish with señor pedro? :P
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:19:39] Lol
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:19:54] pedro3005, You ask questions/bring up topics
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:20:11] besides spanish with señor pedro, that is.
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 20:20:25] well, okay, let me think..
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 20:20:35] oh
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 20:20:43] teach type conversions
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 20:21:19] say we have a char digit
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 20:21:23] we do
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 20:21:40] int z = (int) thisisachar;
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 20:21:41] ?
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:22:32] Well
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:22:44] z is now the character
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:22:52] That is, the character number.
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 20:23:00] isn't it an int?
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:23:03] Really, all things are numbers.
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 20:23:08] oh, yeah, right
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:23:22] The character '1' is a number, but it is not the number 1.
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 20:23:29] int z = thisisachar - '0'
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:23:35] It is the number 49.
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:23:55] pedro3005, That would work as long as thisisachar represented 1-9
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 20:24:17] bgs100, what if it was 0?
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:24:42] Er
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:24:43] Yeah
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:24:45] 0-9
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:24:47] sorry
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 20:24:58] well, a single char can't represent more than that, can it?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 20:25:19] oh, right, it could represent 'a'
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 20:25:45] so if I tried to convert some letter to int it would work
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 20:27:22] and if I have a string, use atoi()
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 20:27:30] ok
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 20:27:49] bgs100, what about float - int - long - double - short etc
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 20:27:58] how to convert between these?
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:28:14] Those all actually represent numbers.
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:28:38] If you convert a floating point number (float/double) to int then it will be floor.
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:28:41] floored*
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:29:02] However
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 20:29:12] 6.9999999999 would become 6?
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:29:18] If you convert a larger size to a smaller size, bit may be cut off
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:29:22] pedro3005, mhm
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:29:36] Unless it was laready 7 :P
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:30:14] already*
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:30:18] silly keyboard
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:30:43] annoying typos are for NOT ME :p
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 20:31:30] oh yeah, you never formally taught #define
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 20:35:43] bgs100, ^
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:36:04] #define FOOBAR 42
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 20:36:23] why use that and not int FOOBAR=42; ?
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:36:26] Now, when the program is being compled all instances of "FOOBAR" will be replaced with 42
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:36:53] pedro3005, You can't modify a define and it doesn't take up space.
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:37:07] They are commonly used for constants.
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 20:37:25] well, you could do #undef and #define it over
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:37:35] However
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:37:45] Not in the execution of the program
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:37:55] All the "preprocessing" is done beforehand
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 20:37:56] orly?
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:38:01] rly
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:38:08] You can actually make functions with define too.
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:38:19] #define sqr(x) x * x
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:38:34] sqr(5) will be replaced, literally, with 5 * 5
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:38:38] However
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:38:49] There's an interesting form of bug from this.
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:39:02] What happens if you say:
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:39:09] sqr(rand())
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:39:10] ?
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:39:21] It will be replaced with: rand() * rand()
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:40:01] Which is *two* calls to rand, so you probably won't be getting the the square you were hoping for!
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 20:40:59] I see
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 20:43:00] bgs100, so......
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:43:17] ......so
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:43:18] wat
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 20:43:23] go on
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:46:27] ...
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:46:35] I'm done.
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 20:47:08] bgs100, think of a new topic then! :p
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:47:21] pedro3005, That is now your jonb.
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:47:24] Not Spanish.
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:47:28] :p
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:47:32] job*
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:47:37] pedro3005, You ask the questions
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:47:44] You bring up the topics now.
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 20:48:03] ok
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:48:25] This class (not this particular session) will be ending very soon.
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 20:48:31] so could I have like char **a, which would be several strings?
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:48:38] pedro3005, Mhm
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 20:48:48] and what about char ***a?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 20:48:49] :P
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 20:49:53] bgs100, aww, ending already?
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:50:04] ?
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:50:05] No
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:50:10] the class isn't ending now
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:50:21] I'm saying that the classes will be
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 20:50:21] but soon
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:50:59] Yes. When you have questions, you can just ask them outside of class (which you do anyway ;P)
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 20:51:15] bgs100, well, what did you think of the experience of teaching?
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:51:25] Pretty good.
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:51:40] You and sedios are fun to talk to, especially when everything gets offtopic :P
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:52:04] I may do a Common Lisp class, as you know.
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 20:52:43] If you do, we should consider hosting that in -classroom. The C# classes have had mild success (better than here anyway)
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:52:54] wait
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:52:58] the classes continued there?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 20:53:02] yes
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 20:53:05] they moved over there
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:53:07] oh :/
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:53:12] Well
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:53:20] I can't really do formal scheduling...
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:53:59] And I consider this a success. I've had class every day, with at least one student :p
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 20:55:06] well, they don't go insane if you're 10 minutes late, but yeah, it sorta needs some level of schedule
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:55:43] Which I cannot do well.
* bgs100 [Jun 26 20:55:56] shakes fist at the concepts of parents and "supper"
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 20:56:16] yeah, I understand
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 20:57:12] I wonder if seidos really learned stuff
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 20:57:21] he seems to have a big difficulty with programming
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:57:43] hm
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:57:48] seems to do alright.
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:57:50] *shrugs*
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 20:59:07] bgs100, hey, at least on common lisp i'll know truly nothing :p
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 20:59:17] Hehehehehe
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 20:59:36] well, I know define and the basic math
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:00:02] Err
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:00:04] Fail
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:00:10] define isn't Common Lisp
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:00:12] xP
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 21:00:18] WHO GIVES A CRAP
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 21:00:20] :/
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:00:22] Uhh
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:00:24] The language?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 21:00:40] ok ok ok
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:01:48] lol
* pedro3005 [Jun 26 21:02:02] rapidly googles
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:02:24] ...
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:02:26] define is scheme
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:02:38] defun and defvar and defparameter are common lisp
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 21:02:49] yeah I see
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 21:04:16] bgs100, I was doing http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1407897 , and to count the character occurrence I made this array with 26 items, but I'd need to make it as a sort of dict to indicate both the char and the number of times it was seen... how to do that?
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:04:33] ...
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:04:44] one sec
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:04:48] lemme see it
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 21:04:57] why do you love ellipses so much?
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:05:25] ...
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:05:30] Anyway
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 21:05:48] you have to admit you use them a lot
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:05:51] pedro3005, Well, you're going to need more than 26 for characters 0-9 :P
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 21:06:15] bgs100, you don't need to count the occurrence of digits, only sum them
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 21:06:21] ...
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:06:24] They represent a kind of a silence where someone is probably either going :| or facepalming
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:06:31] Oh
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:06:32] oops
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 21:06:38] ...
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 21:06:48] see, that was a genuine use
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:06:51] pedro3005, Don't copy my thing >_>
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:07:01] ANYWAY
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:07:15] pedro3005, No, you might've said "Fail" there
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:07:22] ANYWAY
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:07:44] pedro3005, Things like dicts are often made using arrays of structs

<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:12:38] fail
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 21:12:47] well, I did the typedef thing
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:12:51] mystruct array[number];
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:12:55] Like any other type...
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 21:13:07] well how was I supposed to know
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:13:30] Because I said so before? :p
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:13:34] Well, I think I did
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:13:38] Regardless
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:13:42] Now you know
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 21:13:42] not the actual code
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:13:55] orly
* bgs100 [Jun 26 21:14:10] decides he doesn't feel like arguing
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 21:15:05] damn
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 21:15:16] one of the hardest parts of programming is coming up with variable names
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 21:19:40] bgs100, what do I name it :/
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:19:55] foo
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:19:56] bar
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:19:57] baz
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:19:59] notadict
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:20:11] charactercount
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:20:16] char_count
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 21:21:11] rofl notadict
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:26:24] :p
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 21:27:01] bgs100, in a struct, can I already define the initial value of something?
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:27:39] Nope
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 21:27:51] well f... crap
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 21:28:21] bgs100, what if I really need to?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 21:28:22] :p
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:28:36] Make a function to make a struct.
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 21:30:18] hey seidos
<seidos>	[Jun 26 21:30:32] hey pedro3005
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 21:31:40] bgs100, seidos is here
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 21:31:49] bgs100, a function can return a struct?
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:31:49] k
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:31:53] Hi seidos
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:32:07] pedro3005, There was an example where one did.
<seidos>	[Jun 26 21:32:14] hi bgs100
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 21:32:27] struct function(blabla) {blabla
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 21:32:27] ?
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:33:29] Uh
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:33:43] You probably won't have a type called "struct"
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 21:34:48] oh, right
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 21:36:56] bgs100, http://paste.pocoo.org/show/230470/
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 21:36:58] what's wrong?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 21:37:27] oh
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 21:37:28] right
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 21:37:44] well, no
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 21:37:51] changing "struct s" to "ind s" didn't fix it
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:37:53] Uhm
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:38:05] pedro3005, You don't declare structs inside functions...
* bgs100 [Jun 26 21:38:23] facepalms
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 21:39:02] bgs100, you didn't tell me :p
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 21:42:22] oh, I'm stupid
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 21:45:18] bgs100, silly question, I can't have array['a'] can I?
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:45:32] Yep
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:45:44] You can
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:45:55] pedro3005, ^
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 21:46:05] cool
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:46:12] Of course, that's the same thing as typing array[97].
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:46:23] Probably not what you were looking for xD
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 21:46:24] so then, if I have one array of these, how do I iterate through it?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 21:46:44] oh
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 21:46:45] right
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:46:45] pedro3005, You mean get the value for a key?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 21:48:16] nah forget it
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:48:49] You home's Bel-air!
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:48:53] :P
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:48:59] Yo*
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:49:10] *duh dun dun duhh duh*
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 21:49:55] ...
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 21:52:09] bgs100, is having a struct with only one element silly?
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:52:46] Extremely
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 21:53:03] then I don't know what to do
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 21:53:05] it never works
* pedro3005 [Jun 26 21:53:08] cries
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 21:58:41] bgs100, I need help :/
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:59:01] ...
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:59:31] paste
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 21:59:55] pedro3005, Or better, consult chapter 6 of your C book
<seidos>	[Jun 26 22:01:22] bgs100, can you tell me why my code isn't catching for a space?
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 22:01:35] If i can see your code.
<seidos>	[Jun 26 22:01:52] of course.  I'll paste it
<seidos>	[Jun 26 22:02:20] bgs100, http://paste.ubuntu.com/455709/
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 22:02:24] bgs100, http://paste.pocoo.org/show/230476/  -> I discarded a lot of stuff because it was pissing me off
<seidos>	[Jun 26 22:02:44] I'm still not sure how I'm going to check for age to be greater than 0
<seidos>	[Jun 26 22:02:54] I'm guessing I'd have to cast type string to int
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 22:03:12] err
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 22:03:16] seidos, when pasting, you should specify that it's C code, so it's colored neatly
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 22:03:25] pedro3005,
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 22:03:28]         if isdigit(c)
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 22:03:33] Notice anything missing?
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 22:03:54] ...
<seidos>	[Jun 26 22:04:16] oh sorry, here is the colorcoded code:  http://paste.ubuntu.com/455710/
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 22:06:19] bgs100, k, it's working here: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/230477/
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 22:06:57] seidos,
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 22:06:58] char quit[4] = "quit";
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 22:07:06] Two things
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 22:07:13] 1) It should be 5
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 22:07:18] 2) You don't need a number
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 22:07:29] wait
<seidos>	[Jun 26 22:07:32] well it works now
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 22:07:38] so you CAN do char quit[] = "quit"; ?
<seidos>	[Jun 26 22:07:44] what do you mean by "I don't need a number"?
<seidos>	[Jun 26 22:07:53] I tried that, and it wouldn't compile without a warning
<seidos>	[Jun 26 22:07:56] let me try again
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 22:08:00] pedro3005, ...yes
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 22:08:03] I mean
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 22:08:09] bgs100, wouldn't you need strcpy?
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 22:08:14] You don't need a number!
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 22:08:16] pedro3005, NO
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 22:08:21] pedro3005, Remember?!
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 22:08:34] You can set it at initialization!
<seidos>	[Jun 26 22:08:46] okay, it compiled, that was surprising
* bgs100 [Jun 26 22:08:47] mourns the loss of pedro's memory
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 22:08:54] then wouldn't it have to be {'q', 'u', 'i', 't', '\0'} ?
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 22:09:09] ...no...
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 22:09:25] pedro3005, Maybe just go read all the logs again? :P
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 22:09:43] okay, okay
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 22:09:48] I'm kidding.
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 22:09:54] But don't you remember?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 22:10:01] well, now
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 22:10:03] I know
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 22:10:06] "quit" basically is that, btw.
<seidos>	[Jun 26 22:11:19] what can I use to "cast" a string to an int?
* seidos [Jun 26 22:11:30] looks up cast()
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 22:12:26] um
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 22:12:30] atoi()
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 22:16:35] bgs100, give me an idea on how to count the occurrence of letters :x
* bgs100 [Jun 26 22:16:55] goes ugh
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 22:17:18] pedro3005, Write a function to search the array of structs until it finds the struct with the char you are looking for
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 22:17:22] Or
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 22:17:28] Read chapter 6 of your C book
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 22:17:30] Seriously.
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 22:17:38] I *has an implementation* of this
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 22:17:52] Which is a simple function anyway
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 22:19:08] bgs100, I don't understand it
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 22:19:19] ...
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 22:19:24] they have this function
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 22:19:30] What don't you understand?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 22:19:37] int lepalavra (char *, int);
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 22:19:40] what does this do?
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 22:19:42] pedro3005, Look,
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 22:19:43] it's so confusing
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 22:19:48] ugh
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 22:19:53] pedro3005,
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 22:20:17] How would you built a function that searched for a struct with a property (or key) and then returned the struct?
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 22:20:27] pedro3005, And that exact line is a function declaration...
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 22:20:59] but what does the function do?
<seidos>	[Jun 26 22:25:00] I tried atoi()
<seidos>	[Jun 26 22:25:03] but it doesn't work
<seidos>	[Jun 26 22:25:10] man, maybe I should quit while I'm ahead
<seidos>	[Jun 26 22:25:19] it's a sign!  quit works, but that's all that works!
<seidos>	[Jun 26 22:25:23] :'(
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 22:26:21] lol
<seidos>	[Jun 26 22:26:23] oh well, I'll just be patient
<seidos>	[Jun 26 22:26:26] I'll get to work
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 22:26:27] seidos, Did you check the man page?
<seidos>	[Jun 26 22:26:31] maybe a couple years from now
<seidos>	[Jun 26 22:26:37] bgs100, no, good idea
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 22:26:44] pedro3005, I don't know which function you're looking at. I do not speak that language.
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 22:26:48] seidos, Fail.
* bgs100 [Jun 26 22:26:57] sighs and facepalms at the same time
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 22:27:11] bgs100, "readword"
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 22:27:13] something like that
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 22:27:23] er
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 22:27:34] pedro3005, Well, answer my question, ignore that function
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 22:27:50] How would you build a function that searched for a struct with a property (or key) and then returned the struct?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 22:27:51] I'll work on it
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 22:28:18] what do you mean by property?
<seidos>	[Jun 26 22:30:23] okay, read the man page
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 22:30:24] bgs100, ^
<seidos>	[Jun 26 22:30:37] maybe the answer is in the pointer
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 22:30:38] man, philosophy is way simpler
<seidos>	[Jun 26 22:30:42] I don't really get pointers
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 22:31:03] No
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 22:31:15] pedro3005, I mean one of the variables your struct has
<seidos>	[Jun 26 22:31:20] I have the same trouble in philosophy that I do in programming, forgetting stuff
<seidos>	[Jun 26 22:31:50] but then, in philosophy, nothing really has to "work"
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 22:32:18] bgs100, so, for instance, if an int is == 2?
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 22:32:38] if mahstructinstance.somevariable == whatever
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 22:34:56] mystruct findstructwithtwo (structarray, size) { int i; for (i = 0; i < size; i++)  if (structarray[i].value == 2) return structarray[i]; }
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 22:35:07] bgs100, something like
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 22:35:12] that
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 22:35:13] brb
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 22:36:03] seidos, maybe you should practice more
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 22:36:16] pedro3005, Exactly.
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 22:36:21] maybe we're advancing in a pace too fast
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 22:36:35] like, after we learn about functions, you should code a thousand simple functions
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 22:36:38] then move on
<seidos>	[Jun 26 22:36:41] pedro3005, which?  programming or philosophy?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 22:36:47] programming
<seidos>	[Jun 26 22:36:58] I'm practicing now, I'm trying out atoi()
<seidos>	[Jun 26 22:37:02] I'm just slow at it
<seidos>	[Jun 26 22:37:12] this is what happened
<seidos>	[Jun 26 22:37:15] I tried it out
<seidos>	[Jun 26 22:37:16] and it didn't work
<seidos>	[Jun 26 22:37:22] now I need to figure out what atoi() is doing
<seidos>	[Jun 26 22:37:42] so I added it to the program outside the loop, and I'm going to print the integer that I assigned the converted atoi(string) value to
<seidos>	[Jun 26 22:37:45] to see if it's converting it
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 22:37:52] the problem is this challenge uses various concepts that maybe you don't really understand, at least from what it seems
<seidos>	[Jun 26 22:37:58] but when I did that
<seidos>	[Jun 26 22:37:59] it wouldn't compile
<seidos>	[Jun 26 22:38:03] so I have to investigate why
<seidos>	[Jun 26 22:38:07] it's just a painstaking process
<seidos>	[Jun 26 22:38:20] at least the compiler says more than "no".
<seidos>	[Jun 26 22:38:40] I'm doing the best I can to learn
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 22:39:02] haha, real man's compiler
<seidos>	[Jun 26 22:39:51] I told you before, I'm not as fast a learner as you are
<seidos>	[Jun 26 22:39:57] but I'll learn, it'll just take more time
<seidos>	[Jun 26 22:40:04] brb dinner
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 22:40:49] seidos, that's exactly what I'm bringing up, I think you should try to practice things more individually before moving on
<seidos>	[Jun 26 22:50:53] pedro3005, what would you recommend I practice?
<seidos>	[Jun 26 22:50:57] not atoi()?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 22:51:07] not sure
<seidos>	[Jun 26 22:58:12] I mean, I have the basics of the program working
<seidos>	[Jun 26 22:58:36] just gotta' get all the requirements implemented
<seidos>	[Jun 26 22:58:40] there's that word again >:(
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 23:00:26] well I'm tired of programming
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 23:00:32] my eyes hurt
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 23:01:03] pedro3005, Get an editor where you can change the background to a dark color :P
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 23:01:14] bgs100, ewww dark background
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 23:01:21] ...
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 23:01:27] Do you have a problem with this?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 23:01:32] yes
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 23:01:55] I don't like it
<seidos>	[Jun 26 23:04:51] maybe he doesn't like it because I like it, and anything I like must be wrong
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 23:06:37] :o how did you figure it out
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 23:06:46] :p I'm not _that_ silly, come on
<seidos>	[Jun 26 23:07:12] then why you don't like it will remain a mystery
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 23:08:07] it hurts my eyes
<seidos>	[Jun 26 23:08:23] but, that's impossible
<seidos>	[Jun 26 23:08:27] :)
<seidos>	[Jun 26 23:08:39] you mean it hurts your eyes _more_
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 23:09:11] if it hurts my eyes more, it hurts my eyes
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 23:09:28] If it hurts your eyes more,
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 23:09:35] ARGH FLYING SPAGHETTI MONSTER ZOMBIES
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 23:10:39] well, going to scavenge some food, brb
<seidos>	[Jun 26 23:18:55] ah!  I got the age checker working :D
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 23:19:04] :D
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 23:21:15] Yaaay
<seidos>	[Jun 26 23:27:47] all right, basically just had to copy and paste for the userid
<seidos>	[Jun 26 23:27:53] now I just gotta' figure out this space business
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 23:31:15] the final frontier? :P
<seidos>	[Jun 26 23:34:22] more like the 3rd frontier.
<seidos>	[Jun 26 23:34:47] the final frontier is when I learn lisp and see how it informs the universe
<bgs100>	[Jun 26 23:43:47] :)
<bikcmp>	[Jun 26 23:58:34] lisp...
* bikcmp [Jun 26 23:58:37] explodes
<pedro3005>	[Jun 26 23:59:11] heh, what's wrong with it?
* mohi1 [Jun 27 00:01:02] catches bikcmp and puts him in a jar
* bikcmp [Jun 27 00:01:20] likes
<bikcmp>	[Jun 27 00:01:25] haha
<bikcmp>	[Jun 27 00:01:37] what kinda projects have you guys done latey
<bikcmp>	[Jun 27 00:01:41] eh lately
<bikcmp>	[Jun 27 00:01:50] i made a syn. like system for my net
<bikcmp>	[Jun 27 00:02:01] and a wireless barcode reader :)
<bikcmp>	[Jun 27 00:02:05] and PoS
<pedro3005>	[Jun 27 00:03:27] trying to learn
<seidos>	[Jun 27 00:08:28] I think I figured out the problem...scanf doesn't handle spaces
<pedro3005>	[Jun 27 00:08:45] hah
<seidos>	[Jun 27 00:10:13] you laugh at my pain
* seidos [Jun 27 00:10:20] shakes his head in dismay
<seidos>	[Jun 27 00:10:28] well, I tried to do it the easy way, and it turned out to be harder
<seidos>	[Jun 27 00:10:42] I dunno, there might be a way to get it to work
<pedro3005>	[Jun 27 00:22:28] seidos, fgets
<pedro3005>	[Jun 27 00:22:36] well
<pedro3005>	[Jun 27 00:22:39] gets
<pedro3005>	[Jun 27 00:22:41] I think
<seidos>	[Jun 27 00:22:54] I was reading this:  http://bytes.com/topic/c/answers/218363-scanf-include-white-spaces
<pedro3005>	[Jun 27 00:24:42] bgs100, I KNEW IT
<bgs100>	[Jun 27 00:24:51] what
<pedro3005>	[Jun 27 00:24:58] scanf("%[^\t\n]",string);
<pedro3005>	[Jun 27 00:25:06] you can use it with []
<bgs100>	[Jun 27 00:25:08] wat
<pedro3005>	[Jun 27 00:25:15] it's in that link
<bgs100>	[Jun 27 00:25:17] Okay cool
<seidos>	[Jun 27 00:25:36] what's \t?  white space?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 27 00:25:47] bgs100, can you explain how it works?
<bgs100>	[Jun 27 00:25:53] Actually
<bgs100>	[Jun 27 00:26:42] pedro3005, The link explains.
<pedro3005>	[Jun 27 00:28:10] seidos, "For many reasons (including your issue), it's better to get a line from the user with fgets()"
<seidos>	[Jun 27 00:29:26] pedro3005, Pray tell, why is fgets() better than scanf for the OP's issue?
<seidos>	[Jun 27 00:29:26] As a matter of fact and excepting gets(), fgets() is *always* the
<seidos>	[Jun 27 00:29:26] worst solution, when bullet proof behaviour is desired/need.
<pedro3005>	[Jun 27 00:30:29] well he didn't say why
<pedro3005>	[Jun 27 00:30:44] who will you believe? :P
<seidos>	[Jun 27 00:33:28] right now, I'm going to *try* to finish this with scanf()
<seidos>	[Jun 27 00:33:35] at the end, I'll try to segfault it
<seidos>	[Jun 27 00:33:43] if it segfaults, I'll try fgets :|
<bgs100>	[Jun 27 00:35:53] Night
<pedro3005>	[Jun 27 00:36:29] night
<seidos>	[Jun 27 00:36:33] night
