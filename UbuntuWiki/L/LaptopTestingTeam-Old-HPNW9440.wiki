=== Current Issues ===
Hibernation, and IEEE-1394 don't function well (sleep problem is solvable, see below)

=== System Info ===
<pre>

bios-version:68YAF Ver. F.1B
system-manufacturer:Hewlett-Packard
system-product-name:HP Compaq nw9440 (EY314EA#UUZ)
system-version:F.1B

ATTENTION: don't upgrade the BIOS to a version next to F14 !!
           This is a very nightmare for the video driver.
           I have upgraded my bios to the F17 version, and my
           video freeze continuously and display artefacts.
           I have downgraded to the F14 version and now all
           function very well.
           Perhaps with the new nVidia drivers on-coming with
           Feisty, the newest BIOS version will function well too.

NOTE: Everything works perfectly with a model shipped with F17 BIOS
      already (tested on dapper, next upgraded to edgy, with nVidia
      beta drivers from official ubuntu repositories and also with 
      the ones found on nVidia website).

UPDATE 02.05.2007: after the upgrade to Feisty, with new nVidia drivers,
                   I have updated my BIOS to the last F19 version without 
                   problems. So the problem is resolved.

UPDATE 17.06.2007: upgrade to BIOS version F.1A gives no problem also
UPDATE 06.08.2007: upgrade to BIOS version F.1B (28.06.2007) gives no problem also

==== Notes ====

==== To get dual-core recognized ====

In order for the processor to be recognized as dual-core, you have to use the generic kernel, by
installing the "linux-generic" package with synaptic.

==== Video driver issues ====

Some problems (e.g. screen flickering, character console troubles, suspension)
that occur with the proprietary nVidia drivers can be solved by appending the following two
lines to the file "/etc/modprobe.d/options":
<pre>
options nvidia NVreg_SoftEDIDs=0
options nvidia NVreg_RegistryDwords="PerfLevelSrc=0x2222"
</pre>

==== To get suspension to work ====

In order for mouse and keyboard to work properly after wakeup from suspension,
create a file called "97-keyb_unlock.sh" inside the directory "/etc/acpi/resume.d"
and write the following two lines into it:
<pre>
echo -n "i8042" > /sys/bus/platform/drivers/i8042/unbind
echo -n "i8042" > /sys/bus/platform/drivers/i8042/bind
</pre>
If using Compiz/Beryl, i.e. the proprietary nVidia drivers, see the previous
note also.

==== To get the maximum speed out of the processor (edgy only) ====

(''This was taken from the workaround for nx7400'')

Note: this assumes that you are using the "generic" kernel (see previous note)

In edgy, the problem is that
"cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_max_freq" gives 2000000 but
"cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/cpuinfo_max_freq" gives 2333000 for my processor.
To set the maximum frequency to 2333000 do following:
<pre>
}}}

To make settings permanent make a file /etc/init.d/setcpumaxfreq
{{{
echo /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/cpuinfo_max_freq > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_max_freq
echo /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/cpufreq/cpuinfo_max_freq > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/cpufreq/scaling_max_freq
</pre>

Add execution permissions and add to boot scripts:
{{{
