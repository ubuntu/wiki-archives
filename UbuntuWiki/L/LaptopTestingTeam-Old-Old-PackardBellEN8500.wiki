__TOC__

* Contact: <nowiki>[[JoacimHaglund]]</nowiki>
* Make: Packard Bell
* Brand: EasyNote
* Model: A8 (A8500)
* Website: http://www.packardbell.se/products/node1822.asp (A8 xxx is closest, I guess)
* S/N: Only needed if you have a Canonical supplied laptop

=== Current Issues ===
* 1280x768 still won't work with the provided packages without tweaking.
* No sound, no error messages. Seems far from being resolved looking at the alsa bug report from May 2005. The thread seems to be waking up, but Conexant specs for the CX20551 chip is missing. During Jan 2007 the bug seems to have been resolved and by recompiling alsa, the laptop now makes some noise when expected.

==== Notes ====
===== Breezy =====
Using kubuntu install iso.

/proc/acpi is missing some entries: battery/* -- no battery life monitor, ac_adapter/* -- laptop mode won't start. Could it have something with this snippet from the syslog to do?:
<pre>
i2c-acpi-ec.c: ACPI EC SMBus adapter at 0x18
ibm_acpi: ec object not found
</pre>

* Yes, this is the cause of the problem.  Possibly the Embedded Control is at a non-standard address.  Please file a bug assigned to acpi-support (although technically the problem is with linux-source). -PaulSladen
 
===== Dapper =====
Using ubuntu flight 3 install iso.

* After updating to the latest packages in dapper, the battery and ac_adapter entries exist in /proc. (i2c_acpi_ec loads without complaining).

Using ubuntu flight 5 install iso.

* Installed over wlan. :-)
* Hibernates.

Using ubuntu flight 6 install iso.

* i810 driver ok with installer.
