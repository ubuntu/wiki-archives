__TOC__

In mid-2005 Canonical purchased a wide range of laptops from a limited selection of manufacturers, and sent these to active community members who were willing to provide an installation report for every milestone and release candidate of Breezy and Breezy+1. These people are expected to provide debugging information and test potential solutions. After Breezy+2, it's expected that they'll be allowed to keep the laptops.

'''No new laptops are being sent out'''. The final recipients are listed in LaptopTestingTeam.
