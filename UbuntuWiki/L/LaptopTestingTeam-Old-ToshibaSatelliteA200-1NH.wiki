== Notes ==

=== No common CD-ROM drive was detected ===
If you receive this message when try to "Install in text mode", you can solve the boot if the computer can boot from USB media:

1. Download the CD ISO image

2. <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick|Make an USB memory stick bootable with the same Ubuntu version]]</nowiki> (with isotostick.sh)

3. Insert the memory stick to USB port and configure the boot order in the CMOS/BIOS: 1-USB 2-CD 3-HD

4. Keep the CD drive empty

5. Boot the computer from your stick

6. When the boot menu appears (same as CD-ROM boot menu), insert the real CD in the CD drive.

7. Choose now your option to boot, and press "ENTER". The CD-ROM detection will be successfull.
