__TOC__

Student at the TU-Delft (NL), working on my graduation project about creating usable enterprise software.

Using Ubuntu for my desktop (Asus), notebook (Toshiba tablet) and server (Asus) as main OS, only using windows to upgrade my phone's firmware. 

Also using it for a lot of my clients, mainly as server, because they are too depended on Microsofts Word (Open Office isn't compatible enough with .doc documents) and because of particulare hardware like electronic-postage-stamp-credit-reader.
