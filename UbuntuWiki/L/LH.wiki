I worked with the Ubuntu folks, especially Claire Newman, to get UDS rocking and rolling for a week at the Googleplex.  I spent the week with the community to help them at the summit, and for now I'm lurking on mailing lists and getting started understanding what the community is doing.  I'm particularly interested in usability issues, though not a programmer.
