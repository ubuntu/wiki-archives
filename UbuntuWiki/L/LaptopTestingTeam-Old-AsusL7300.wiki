__TOC__

* Brand: Asus
* Model: L7300 and L7200
* Website: http://www.asus.com
* S/N: -

=== Current Issues ===
* Crashes starting X when not using NoMTRR
* Asus states the notebook has cardbus slots, but only 16-bit card work
* Sound doesn't work correctly (Didn't get it to work)
* Screen stays on when you close the notebook (-does- go off in some installs i had, didn't have any time to figure)
* Sometimes just randomly locks up

=== Correct Graphics handling ===
Edit your xorg.conf to match this:

Section "Monitor"
Identifier "Generic Monitor"
Option "DPMS"
HorizSync 20-60
VertRefresh 20-120
EndSection

Section "Device"
Identifier "Silicon Motion, Inc. SM910"
Driver "siliconmotion"
ChipSet "lynx"
Option "NoMTRR"
Option "NoDDC"
BusID "PCI:0:2:0"
EndSection

This will prevent the computer from directly locking up.
=== Correct Grub boot file ===
Just add this to your 'append' part when you're using Lilo.

append=" noinotify apic=off acpi=off pci=norouteirq noapic nolapic noacpi noapm noonotify video=vesafb:nomtrr"
