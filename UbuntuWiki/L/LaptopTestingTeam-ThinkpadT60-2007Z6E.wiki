=== Current Issues ===
None. Minor sound issues as outlined below. Have found third party software for enabling the fingerprint reader; and will update when I have tested that out. Highly recommended as a dedicated Linux machine.

==== Notes ====
^1^ The computer will sleep, but has problem waking up (ie, hanged desktop). Probably ATI drivers at fault here.

^2^ This laptop comes with Intel's High Definition audio chipset, which only worked for me after compiling ALSA from scratch using HdaIntelSoundHowto; even then, the sound is distorted when both the PCM and Master are turned up 100%

^3^ Unlike on Windows, this function key turns off ''both'' WiFi and Bluetooth simultaneously, instead of a toggle. There is also a hardware toggle switch on this model.
