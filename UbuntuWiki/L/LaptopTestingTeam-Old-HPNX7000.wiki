==== Notes ====
Upgraded from Breezy to Drapper without trouble at all.

Works perfectly under Edgy.
ATI drivers (fglrx) 8.28.8 work with correct (powerstriped) Modelines.
When a TV is connected to the nx7000 via the S-Video port, Xserver will automatically
switch down to 1024x768 after running it again. This will result in a clone-mode.
1024x768 creates some out-of-sync image on the xserver but the output on tv is perfect.
Probably need to put correct modelines for 1024x768 in xorg.conf
