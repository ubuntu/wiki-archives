__TOC__

== Installation ==
I chose to do a PXE installation due to the fact that this model has no CD-ROM and no floppy. The installation went smooth, Ubuntu recognized most of my hardware and X ran out-of-the-box.

=== Detected Hardware ===
* ethernet and wireless
* touchpad
* video card

=== Missing Hardware ===
* Pen/Stylus/Digitizer <- whatever you want to call it

=== Unknown ===
These hardware components have not been tested by myself as I have no use for them.
* Card readers: SD/MMC/CF
* PCMCIA
* IrDA - will test later
* External monitor - will test later

== Configuration ==

=== Tablet Pen ===
In order to get this working I had to install the <code>setserial</code> program.
Edit the /etc/serial.conf file, and add the following line to it:
<pre>
/dev/ttyS0 port 0x338 irq 4 autoconfig
</pre>
Re-start the computer or just execute (as root)
<pre>
}}}

Add the following lines to /etc/X11/xorg.conf:
{{{
