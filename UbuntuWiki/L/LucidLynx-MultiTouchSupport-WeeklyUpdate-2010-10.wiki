==== Bryce Harrington ====

On the X side, the last two days have been productive and the basic
packaging work is complete:

* multitouch PPA created
* -evdev has multitouch support added (in PPA)
* -wacom has the N-Trig hw support (in Lucid)
* -evtouch is fixed to build again (in Lucid)
* multitouchd daemon packaged (in PPA)

The PPA is coming together here:

 https://edge.launchpad.net/~xorg-edgers/+archive/multitouch/+packages

I still need to get the daemon to actually init and start automatically
but ran out of time this week.  Plus I've never packaged a daemon before
so this is a bit of a learning experience.  Project for Monday.

After that, it's on to testing...
