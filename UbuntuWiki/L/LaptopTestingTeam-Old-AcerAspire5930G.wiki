__TOC__

* Contact: BernhardReiter2 <ockham gmx net>, Blare82 <blare82 a-t g-mail c-om>
* Make: Acer
* Brand: Aspire
* Model: 5930G-944G32BN
* Website: http://global.acer.com/products/notebook/as5930.htm

=== Current Issues ===

* Wifi doesn't seem to work with kernel versions less than 2.6.27-2 (for 32 bit systems) or 2.6.27-3 (64 bit) . See:
** http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=879134
** https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/256629
* The card reader does not work unless you boot with a card inside (tested with SD, see bug <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/258446|#258446]]</nowiki>).
* The fingerprint reader works (using fprint related packages)
* There is a Bluetooth button to switch it on/off BT Radio, but this model doesn't have builtin Bluetooth.
* There are two special keys up the arrow keys with the symbols € and $ (in spanish keyboard), but they don't work.
* Audio output for Headphones seems not to work.
** Headphones output is bound to Surround in mixer (jaunty alpha5)
