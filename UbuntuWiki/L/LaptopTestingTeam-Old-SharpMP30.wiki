==== Notes ====
description of quixote6's Feisty install: http://www.molvray.com/acid-test/2007/07/ubuntu-and-my-computers-brain-transplant/ . Also, turning off that cursed tap-to-click "feature" took more doing than it's supposed to.  Instructions at: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=2323451#poststop .  It involves editing /etc/X11/xorg.conf which has to be done as root (or sudo).
