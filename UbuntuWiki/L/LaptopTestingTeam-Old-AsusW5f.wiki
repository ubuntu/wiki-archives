==== Notes ====
Bluetooth-Mouse has to be added manually into the hidd-config.

With Edgy also some tweaks in gconf-editor are needed for connecting to bluetooth-mobile-phone.

For Touchpad working correctly (also for some FN-Keys) libsynaptic has to be installed.

For Camera-Support in Edgy, latest gspca-driver has to be installed, in Feisty this is not needed (because it' shipped with it).

The card-reader doesn't work with MMC-Cards, but SD-Cards work (others not tested).
