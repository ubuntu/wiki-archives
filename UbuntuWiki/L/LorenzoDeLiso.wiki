My name is Lorenzo De Liso, I'm from Italy. I started to use linux with ubuntu in the 2006 about. I like ubuntu and I think it's a wonderful operating system. I like the open source, and in my opinion any user should decide the default operating system to use.

Sometimes, I also help in the channel #ubuntu-it.
