=== Description ===

This tutorial helps solving image/video thumbnails problems in Gnome Nautilus on Ubuntu Breezy.

=== The work ===

==== Install/Remove ====

First, install Totem-xine, unnistalling Totem-gstreamer, because it has more video codecs, including proprietaries ones, if you have codecs installed.

==== Refreshing thumbnails icons ====

As you may have entered folders that have video with Totem-gstreamer or other video-thumbnail app., let's clean the cache.

Type the following in the console:

<pre>
rm -rf ~/.thumbnails/normal/*
rm -rf ~/.thumbnails/fail/*
</pre>

This will force Nautilus to reconstruc all thumbnails, and as you got the right thumbnailer, you will get thumbs. from all formats.
