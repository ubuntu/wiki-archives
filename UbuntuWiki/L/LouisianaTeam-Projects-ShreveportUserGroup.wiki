fxef is a member of the Shreveport PC User Group.  They meet every third Thursday at LSUS at 7:00pm.  Attendence is about 25 to 30 people, all using Windows, with one exception.  

After gauging interest we would like to have a presentation and short Q&A session on Linux, Ubuntu and FOSS.  Meetings are usually 2 hours long.  Our presentation would need to be about an hour.  The membership is described as "non-geek retired people" so our presentation should be geared toward their interests.

Things to do:
* Create survey for the user group.
* Possibly schedule a weekend meeting so more LoCo members would be able to attend.
* Create presentation with benefits of Linux, Ubuntu, FOSS, example applications.  Maybe the install process.  Determine Length of presentation.  How long are meetings usually.

Things we need to know:
* Who will handle what
