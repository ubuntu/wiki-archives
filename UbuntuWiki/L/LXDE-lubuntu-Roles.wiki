== Lubuntu Teams ==

This page is designed to show each of the current teams in the Lubuntu project. Its goal is to help you see who is involved and our current developments, and also the current areas of development that you may fit in.

| All the information concerning the development of Lubuntu are gathered on this page. If you want to start to contribute, you probably want to start small. You can start with LXDE (see LXDE development section), or with a small Lubuntu application (see Lubuntu specific development section) and check the source code, or the bug list. Interested about Coding? Packaging? Bug Fixing? Developing specific Application? Have enough skills and experience to dig deeper? Join us!

| <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lubuntu/Testing|Testing]]</nowiki>
| The Testing Team is responsible for using formal test cases to check images of Lubuntu. This allows the Release Team to easily gauge the health of the images. This makes it possible to tell whether an image is functional enough to justify a release and determine where resources need to be allocated to make sure an image gets released. Testing consists of testing milestone images, daily image testing and specific testing. All release stages are tracked by <nowiki>[[http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/|ISO Tracker]]</nowiki> where you can get the latest builds, see and allocate any <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lubuntu/ReportingBugs|bugs]]</nowiki>.
| 
| <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lubuntu/ContactUs#Contact_Us|Mailing list]]</nowiki>, and on Freenode IRC. Join #ubuntu-quality and #ubuntu-release. Note these are general channels shared across all flavors, so you may want to use #lubuntu-offtopic for specific questions about Lubuntu. #lubuntu is another option but we try to keep this specifically to support, so it's not recommended.

| Reporting bugs is important to improve the quality of Lubuntu and of all the software included. Before you can report bugs, if you not have a Launchpad account please do follow <nowiki>[[https://help.launchpad.net/YourAccount/NewAccount|these instructions]]</nowiki>. If you're not sure if you should report a bug, report it anyway. Also, it's easier to troubleshoot bugs in a single place than it is on a mailing list or IRC. The results of any testing should always end up on the bug report.

Under the Wiki & Docs Team, we are working on two areas that are linked in terms of what they contain, but use different methods to deliver that information: <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lubuntu|Lubuntu Wiki]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/Documentation|Lubuntu Documentation]]</nowiki>.

All of the teams work together towards the improvement of Lubuntu distribution. They all collaborate their efforts to achieve better results. This was the way that felt better to achieve a high level of efficiency. Nevertheless, more sub-groups can be added as long as they go along with the following requirement list:

* Need to be active : It's essential that people of the team are active. It's not necessary to be active on a daily base, but a minimal participation is necessary, so we don't have "ghost members" in the teams. It's better to leave the team temporary if we don't have time on the short-term, and enter it again after.
* Participation can be done by members outside the team: of course, other people can help the team, without the need to be part of the team. For example, you can contribute on some wiki pages without to be part of the team. But, if you want to do more, it's better to enter the team, so you can coordinate with other members.
* Free to organize themselves : you can use the wiki, or a specific mailing list, delegate responsibility on 1 member for a specific area or not, nominate a member who will speak at the weekly meeting or not ...
* As not all team members are on the general mailing list (and all the other lubuntu mailing sub-team lists) because each Sub-Team has its own mailing list; please ensure your Team Leaders / Admins appraise all teams via the Admin Team mailing list.

Lubuntu has 9 different Sub-Teams/Departments. With the exception of the Admin Team, each Sub-Team works and organize itself independently and coordinate with the other Sub-Teams via the Admin Team for the greater good of Lubuntu.
