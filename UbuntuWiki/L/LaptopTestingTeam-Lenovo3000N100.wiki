This is the LaptopTestingTeam page for the Lenovo 3000 N100. The Lenovo website lists <nowiki>[[http://www-307.ibm.com/pc/support/site.wss/document.do?sitestyle=lenovo&lndocid=MIGR-48NT8D|laptops which are compatible]]</nowiki> with various Linux distros (Suse, Novell, Red Hat, Turbolinux). The N100 has only been tested on the last two.

Thanks to the work of the ubuntu-laptop team all of the major issues with this laptop have been resolved.  I highly recommend this laptop if you want a top notch Linux laptop. The major outstanding issue is the fingerprint reader which uses a closed driver from Authentec (more information <nowiki>[[http://gkall.hobby.nl/authentec.html|here]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[http://www.csz-online.de/projects/aesxxxx-linux/|here]]</nowiki>; note that the <nowiki>[[http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/How_to_enable_the_fingerprint_reader_with_ThinkFinger|solution using ThinkFinger]]</nowiki> does not work on the N100).

=== Current Issues ===

A user has reported this machine overheats when running 2.6.20-15-generic. For more details see <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.20/+bug/114312|bug report #114312]]</nowiki>.   I however have been using feisty since herd 3 and had no over heating issues whatsoever.  CPU temperatures range from about 49C when idle to 71C when processor is at 100% for an extended period of time.

==== Notes ====

 
* '' Gnome reports 1024x768 correctly, i.e. the default install sets the resolution to a full-screen stretched out 1024x768.  Installing 915resolution and following the man page works fine.  Just restart X; X will then use, and Gnome will correctly report, 1280x800.  No further changes required for the proper resolution to survive reboots.''

* '''I have a different model instead of the one displayed here - I have the high-end model with 1680x1050 resolution and internal webcam and some other stuff.. How can I write a own test? Because I got more to work than the writer of this page.'''
* ''I hope no one minds but I got rid of breezy and put in a column for Feisty.  Lots of good fixes for this laptop have been made so I would recommend upgrading.''
