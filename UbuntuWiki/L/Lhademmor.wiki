=== About me ===

Hi, my name is '''Mads Peter Rommedahl''', but I'm mainly referred to as MP or Lhademmor. At IRC I go by the nick '''ligemeget'''.

I've mainly been active on the Danish Wikipedia - where I've been an administrator since spring 2004.
I first tried Ubuntu back in the days of Breezy Badger, but couldn't get it to work properly back then. I came back in the Feisty-era, and found that Ubuntu worked nicely on my laptop. Now, I've even got Hardy Heron working on my home computer thereby making me run 100% Ubuntu :D

I'm currently a member of the Documentation Team, where I'm mainly correcting typos and rewriting simple stuff - in the future I plan on becoming a MOTU sometime.
I'm also translating Ubuntu and GNOME Documentation, as well as some UI translations every now and then.
