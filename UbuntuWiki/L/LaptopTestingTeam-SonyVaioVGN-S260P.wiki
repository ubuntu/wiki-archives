=== Current Issues ===
* '''Display'''
*** When installing Dapper Flight 6, must NOT use default VGA setting. You will get an interesting "fuzz" effect.
*** When installing and using Breezy, I would have to instances of the display on my screen (both small, one above, another below, but cut-off).
* Keyboard response seems to be a bit sluggish.
* Hibernate feature does not appear to work.
