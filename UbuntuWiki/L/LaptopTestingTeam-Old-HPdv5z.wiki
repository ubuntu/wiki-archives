=== Current Issues ===

==== CPU Temperature ====

The ACPI DSDT table in the BIOS is non-compliant, which prevents the reading of the CPU temperature. In order to read the CPU table, the DSDT table has to be overridden by giving a modified table to the kernel in the initrd image.

'''CAUTION: Editting and overriding the DSDT table could damage your laptop and the necessary changes may be BIOS version dependent!'''

The current DSDT from the BIOS needs to be copied from <code>/proc/acpi/dsdt</code> to a location where it can be worked on by
<pre>
sudo cat /proc/acpi/dsdt > /some-folder/dsdt.aml.old
</pre>
The copied table is in a compiled form (aml) that is not easy to work with. It can be decompiled into source (dsl) which can be edited and recompiled. The compiler (iasl) can be obtained by installing the the ''iasl'' package. Decompile the aml file by
<pre>
iasl -d dsdt.aml.old
</pre>
This produces the file <code>dsdt.aml.dsl</code> which is the source code. Edit it at around line 9400 (might be BIOS version dependent) looking for the text
<pre>
Method (_HOT, 0, Serialized)
{
    If (LEqual (TPOS, 0x40))
    {
        Return (Add (0x0AAC, Multiply (TPC, 0x0A)))
    }
}

Method (_CRT, 0, Serialized)
{
    If (LLess (TPOS, 0x40))
    {
        Return (Add (0x0AAC, Multiply (TPC, 0x0A)))
    }
}
</pre>
The If statements are checking the TPOS variable. This checks which operating system is being run. Windows is 0x40 or 0x41 while linux is 0x80. The DSDT table from the BIOS essentially tells ACPI that linux cannot read the temperature when it actually can. This can be fixed by commenting out the If statements and their respective brackets. '''Do not make any other changes unless you know what you are doing!''' Afterwards, it should look like this:
<pre>
Method (_HOT, 0, Serialized)
{
//    If (LEqual (TPOS, 0x40))
//    {
        Return (Add (0x0AAC, Multiply (TPC, 0x0A)))
//    }
}

Method (_CRT, 0, Serialized)
{
//    If (LLess (TPOS, 0x40))
//    {
        Return (Add (0x0AAC, Multiply (TPC, 0x0A)))
//    }
}
</pre>
Now the dsl file needs to be recompiled to aml. This is done by the command
<pre>
iasl dsdt.aml.dsl
</pre>
Which outputs the aml file <code>dsdt.aml.aml</code> hopefully as opposed to an error message. This file has to be put into your initrd. First, copy it by the following:
<pre>
sudo cp dsdt.aml.aml /etc/initramfs-tools/DSDT.aml
</pre>
where it will be loaded into the initrd when it is updated. It is suggestible to have more than one kernel installed and only update the initrd for the most recent current version so that a fall back kernel using the DSDT from the BIOS is still available. Update the appropriate initrd by
<pre>
sudo update-initramfs -u -k kernel-version
</pre>
(if you have no clue about your kernel version, just running
<pre>
sudo update-initramfs -u -k `uname -r`
</pre>
should do the job).

Reading the CPU temperature should now be possible the next time the kernel is booted.
