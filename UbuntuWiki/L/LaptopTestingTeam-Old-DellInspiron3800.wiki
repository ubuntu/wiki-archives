=== Current Issues ===

=== Issues (Edgy) ===

=== Issues (Dapper) ===
* The machine can sometimes freeze inexplicably. This might be due to heat.
* Suspend and hibernation only works about half the time. Either it fully suspends/hibernates or it tries for a minute before returning to the desktop. Upgrading the RAM from 128MB to 512MB increased the reliability to almost 100%.
* My 802.11g wireless PC Card (Netgear WG511v2, using the Ndiswrapper driver) refused to work after resuming from suspend/hibernation. I had to use cardctl to eject and reload the card for it to be detected again. This is not a problem in Edgy.
* The system often freezes a few minutes after a USB device is connected.
