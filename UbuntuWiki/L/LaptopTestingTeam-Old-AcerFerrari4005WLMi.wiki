* Brand: Acer
* Make : Ferrari
* Model: 4005WLMi

This page only covers what works/doesn't work on the Acer Ferrari 4005 after a standard (K)Ubuntu installation. Another page -- <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AcerFerrari4005Dapper]]</nowiki> -- covers tweaks which can be made after the install to make the computer ''much'' more usable.

=== Jaunty alpha 5 issues ===
* About 1/3 of the time the X window system won't come up after a boot.  t It just sits on a blank screen for ~30 seconds, then goes to a text screen and tries again.  It may start working after a few tries.
* Suspend problems -- it will suspend just fine, but the screen is all mixed up when it tries to power back on.  Hibernate works fine, but is barely faster than the new speedy full boot.

=== Hardy issues ===
* As of 2008-04-05, wireless doesn't work after suspend/hibernate using the b43 driver.  <nowiki>[[https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/network-manager/+bug/209970|#209970]]</nowiki>
** Seems to be fixed as of 2008-04-11.

=== Gutsy issues ===
* No TV Output: <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/37764|#37764]]</nowiki>
* Some hotkeys could be better configured & non-working $ or € keys <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/131404|#131404]]</nowiki> <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/30562|#30562]]</nowiki>
* Firmware for wireless has to be installed before wifi works.
** Restricted drivers manager recognizes that firmware is missing, but only tells you the package bcm43xx-fwcutter is missing.
** You must enabled third-party sources to get bcm43xx-fwcutter.
** Once this package is installed manually, the restricted drivers manager can get the firmware. Once this is done, wireless works great. If the bcm43xx-fwcutter package could come with Gutsy, this whole process would be all but automatic.
** This may be working in the latest daily build.
* With the default video driver, lockups of the system, where the mouse cursor still moved but nothing else responded at all, were common.
** This may be related to the graphics effects, not necessarily the driver. Bug filed at <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/emerald/+bug/115283|#115283]]</nowiki>
** After installing the restricted ati driver, this seems to have stopped happening, but the enhanced graphics effects aren't enabled with the restricted driver.
** The desktop effect cannot be enabled in the latest beta as the X700 video card has been blacklisted (<nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-video-ati/+bug/144077|#144077]]</nowiki>). The effects can however be re-enabled by removing the blacklisting for the X700, but that will no remove the freeze problem.

=== Feisty Final issues ===
* Scroll button on touchpad non-operational. Needs xorg.conf fix to work - See here - SynapticsTouchpadHowTo. <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-input-synaptics/+bug/47971|#47971]]</nowiki>
* Charging time always shows 0:00 to complete charge. <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-power-manager/+bug/62440|#62440]]</nowiki>
* IRDA requires restart after suspend/resume. <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/irda-utils/+bug/93317|#93317]]</nowiki>

====== Requires Testing/Confirmation: ======
* Wireless (SR changed his Broadcom for an atheros)
* Bluetooth (SR's onboard bluetooth died)
* Docking station
* DVI
* Modem (won't work in amd64)
* Infared Port
