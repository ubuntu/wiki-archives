__TOC__

* Contact: None
* Make: Sony
* Model: VGN-S360P

* Sadly I no longer own this laptop thus I am unable to test dapper. I hope someone can pick up this page - <nowiki>[[b3nw]]</nowiki>

=== Pre-Dapper ===

5.04
* Function Keys for the exception of home/end pg up and pg down (funct + left arrow right arrow ect) do not respond at all.
* Seems the fan runs at full speed constantly. (This is fixed in breezy but I have no idea how/why)
* [2] Settable buttons are not settable, this requires some special program on windows and doubt we'll get it to work in linux without sony's assistance.

5.10
* Function Keys for the exception of home/end pg up and pg down (funct + left arrow right arrow ect) do not respond at all.
* [1] Default install does not correctly setup mouse scroll wheel for usb mouse
* [2] Settable buttons are not settable, this requires some special program on windows and doubt we'll get it to work in linux without sony's assistance.
* [3] fglrx works with restricted-modules glxgears is extremely broke, bug has been filed tho.
* [4] Does not work by default. With package "spicctrl" (apt-get install spicctrl) and then modprobe sonypi (add to /etc/modules) for auto boot. all function keys work! Special Thanks to Linus G for the info.
