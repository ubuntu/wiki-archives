__TOC__

Please use this page for discussion about the Targa Traveller 826. I appreciate all input.

== Model compatibility ==
Following laptop models or model series are known to be based on the MS-1029 barebone:
* MSI Megabook M635:
* Targa Traveller 826: known to be sold under this name in Germany and the United Kingdom.
* Targa Traveller 826T: same as above, but with a Turion CPU instead of Mobile Athlon64.
The Targa Traveller 826W is most likely ''not'' based on the MS-1029 barebone, it seems to have a different BIOS and a different WLAN IC.
