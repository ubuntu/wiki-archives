=== Current Issues ===
-The therm_adt746x is not loaded by default, neither in the installer nor in the installed system. That makes the fan to stay ALWAYS off. Careful! modprobing therm_adt746x solves the problem.

-Some problems handing the wireless card.

-Some problem with sleep.

==== Notes ====
* Some Problems with the Wireless Card: sometime you need to restart to get it working again.
* * Firmware must be installed separately. Relatively slow and buggy. The GUI tools rarely works. 

(feisty 7.04) nm-applet seems to work pretty reliably now for both wired and wireless. Occasional failures on resume from sleep with wireless.
