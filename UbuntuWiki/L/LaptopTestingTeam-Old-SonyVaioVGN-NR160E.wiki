=== Current Issues ===
Didn't test with developer release, with 7.10 (Gutsy):
* Fn brightness adjust keys don't work
* Compiz refuses to load. If forced, - works but breaks video playback
* Suspend/Resume doesn't work.
* When adapter is plugged in, notification for brightness change shows up (attached to wrong event???)
* Battery charge estimation may be somewhat off, laptop turned off while status widget reported ~5% left

==== Notes ====
Mostly usable, inability to hibernate is probably the biggest issue.
