=== Current Issues ===
Ubuntu does not install by the default process. You need to tweak a little. However, the following worked for me. You can try the same: 

==== Starting Live CD ====
Starting Live CD is to be done using the following kernel options at startup
<pre>
noapic
</pre>

==== nVIDIA GeForce driver ====
The nVIDIA driver is available in a restricted repository. This has been written for a Debian system and works perfectly with this model. Try <nowiki>[[http://www.albertomilone.com/|"this link"]]</nowiki> and you would have a wonderful new graphics experience, after downloading Alberto's nVIDIA drivers. 

Note: Edgy Version of Ubuntu needs this driver. In fact, without it, Edgy graphics run slow. Google Earth for example does not run without good graphics. 

=== System Info ===
<pre>
bios-version:F.17
system-manufacturer:Hewlett-Packard
system-product-name:Presario V6000 (RE167PA#ACJ)
system-version:Rev 1
</pre>
