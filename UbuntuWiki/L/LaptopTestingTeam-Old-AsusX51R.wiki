==== Notes ====
For 3D-acceleration and the Wireless NIC to be working, the proprietary drives had to be enabled via the restricted drivers manager.

To enable cpu frequency scaling '''acpi-cpufreq''' had to be added to ''/etc/modules''.

For suspending/hibernating to work properly when using the ATi Catalyst drivers in ''/etc/default/acpi-support'' the following lines had to be edited:
 '''SAVE_VBE_STATE=false
 POST_VIDEO=false'''
