=== Current Issues ===
Have to disable "TV out" to get X working with correct resolution (see bug 315169).<<BR>>
Sound doesn't work without adding model=lenovo to snd-hda-intel kernel module.<<BR>>
Additionally speaker mute when connecting headphones only works with latest alsa from repository (2007-12-08).<<BR>>
Compiz doesn't work since the X3100 is blacklisted, can be enabled but seems to have some issues with shadows and video playback.<<BR>>
Backlight doesn't come back on after suspend, but pressing ctrl-alt-F1 turns it back on. (DOUBLE_CONSOLE_SWITCH=true in /etc/default/acpi-support does not help).<<BR>>
Using softkeys to adjust backlight brightness sometimes takes several seconds, the gnome brightness panel applet doesn't have this problem.<<BR>>

==== Notes ====

For getting the wifi back up after suspend add iwl4965 to the MODULES variable in /etc/default/acpi-support.

For getting sound to work add
<code>options snd-hda-intel index=0 model=lenovo</code>
at the end of /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.

To get correct resolution in Xorg I followed advice on
<nowiki>[[http://carrot.hep.upenn.edu/wiki/doku.php?id=thinkpad:start]]</nowiki>

There are a couple of Intel 965 based laptops very similar to the U1E, including the Lenovo Thinkpad T61.
