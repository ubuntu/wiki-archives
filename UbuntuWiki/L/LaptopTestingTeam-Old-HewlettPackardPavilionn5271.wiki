__TOC__

Ubuntu has been successfully installed on this Laptop since 6.10 (Edgy Eft) with 256Mb of RAM being the only addition I've made to it since purchase.  
As at 7.04 (Feisty Fawn) I was also able to run Xubuntu, Kubuntu and Ubuntu with the option to choose the various Desktop Environments at the login screen.
The laptop is currently running 7.10 (Gutsy Gibbon) with GNOME as the only environment after a clean installation from a 6.10 install disk and subsequent upgrades through the manager app. 

The only in built hardware I've yet to get working are the IrDA port and TV output interface.
Connection to the internet is through a 3Com PCMCIA 10/100 MBps card.
The other problem it still has is an issue with ACPI in that it can't power the system down completely, you get to the ubuntu splash screen on black background and the progress bar goes blank, the hard drive spins down, but the system needs to be physically switched off after that point.

Install:

Carried out correctly, both from the 6.10 alternative i386 CD, when it had 128Mb RAM and from the 6.10 Live CD provided with Ubuntu Linux for Dummies. No problems experienced.
