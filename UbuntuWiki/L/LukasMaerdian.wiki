=== About Me ===

My name is Lukas Märdian, I am 32 years old and live in Germany. I was self-employed for 4 years, after studying CS at TUM in Munich and in Beijing. Did a trip around the world in 2019 and started working as a Software Engineer for Canonical in early 2020, as part of the Ubuntu Foundations team. I help maintaining the netplan.io project, co-maintain the systemd package and generally work with upstream and Debian developers on package maintenance.
