==== Notes ====

* Touchpad's middle lower button acts like a third button, upper one does nothing, no scrolling.
* Fn + jklö/uiop/7890/m,.- momentarily inverts the current NumLock setting for these keys.
* Fn + F5 is remembered even across reboots! Scaling low-resolution modes to full screen is great for games and even the console -- no more black borders.
* Fn + F3/F8/F9 for sound control work only under X, i.e. not in a console nor in full screen games.
* Fn + F10 cycles between laptop, external monitor and laptop+monitor. However, the monitor image is bad (too narrow and juggling) when both displays are on. So only either laptop or monitor display work.
* Application keys (A/B/Internet/E-Mail) seem dead: no kernel message, no xev output. The 5th key only switches light between "Application" and CD-"Player" LEDs.
