==== Notes ====

===== Hibernation =====

====== Karmic x86_64 ======

I changed my swap partition to > 1GiB.  This allows me to hibernate and so I can confirm that it does work.

====== Intrepid x86_64 ======

When I cleanly reinstalled and upgraded to 64-bit Ubuntu 8.10 I ignorantly made my swap partition too small (500MB).  Unfortunately I cannot test this unless one of two things happen:

1.  I reinstall with a larger swap partition.

2.  Ubuntu's hibernate (suspend-to-disk) implementation (swsusp) allows for the use of swap files as well as swap partitions.

===== Bluetooth =====

====== Intrepid, Jaunty, Karmic x86_64  and other versions since Hardy ======

I am unable to say whether the Bluetooth would be automatically detected without the use of the pull up that I did (see the Hardy x86 part below).  I can be sure to say that the Wifi LED now works, which didn't in Hardy (before or after the Bluetooth fix).

====== Hardy x86 ======

I had mine be pulled up and working by enabling the usb in my Virtualised Windows Vista (using VirtualBox).

The USB device I had to enable was “Bus 001 Device 003: ID 0a5c:4500 Broadcom Corp.”

''sudo lsusb -v -d 0a5c:4500'' showed that it was infact a Broadcom Corp. device with the 'iProduct' being BCM2045B2.

I also forwarded all other bluetooth devices to the Vista virtualisation.

I then downloaded and ran the program I mentioned above, found here:

[direct link] http://ftp.dell.com/network/R159805.EXE

[dell support site] http://support.ap.dell.com/support/topics/global.aspx/support/dsn/en/document?c=nz&dl=false&l=en&s=gen&docid=2D785CBB1BBFF5F1E040A68F5B282502&doclang=en&cs=

the [direct link] to the .exe is exactly the same as the one on the [dell support site].

After I did this lsusb showed a new device --

<pre>
Bus 001 Device 004: ID 413c:8126 Dell Computer Corp. Wireless 355 Bluetooth
</pre>

====== After thought ======

If/when ReactOS has USB support, then it may be likely that one could use ReactOS to enable their Dell Wireless 355 Bluetooth cards. This would see you save on having to use Windows at all (Sure, you could pirate it for the sake of VirtualBox, but that's not ideal is it).

===== Author Note =====

I will be adding to this page when I upgrade my laptop to the latest distribution.  I have added to this page because I found it useful when I was setting up my Inspiron 1720 with Ubuntu, and found that I could write this page up to date with my findings, further helping others.

My Inspiron 1720 specs are as follows:
* Intel Core 2 Duo 2.2GHz (T7500)
* nVidia Ge&#70;orce 8600M GT with 256 MB
* Intel PRO/Wireless 3945 Dual Band 802.11a/g 54M
* Dell Wireless 355 Bluetooth Module
* 2MP Webcam
* 4GB 667MHz DDR2 SDRAM
(Justifying my editing/adding to this page).
