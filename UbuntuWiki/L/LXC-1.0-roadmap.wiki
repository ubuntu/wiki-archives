__TOC__

Initial roadmap/TODO for LXC 1.0:
* Core
** libseccomp2 support (with per-architecture policies)
** Unprivileged containers using user namespaces (cgroup policy, setuid binaries, ...)
** Plugin-based storage backend system
** Support for other LSM (SELinux/SMACK)
** Tool consistency (reduce the number of binaries, make sure the options are consistent, ...)
** Make our tools use the API so we don't have two implementations of the same thing.
* API
** Release 1.0 with a stable versioned API
** Merge Go binding
** Implement missing calls (attach, clone, console, ...)
** Write our own libvirt driver based on lxcapi
* Monitor/control socket
** Multi-threading
** Stable versioned protocol (so upgrades don't break it)
** Change client tools to do simple calls instead of having extra local logic (cgroup with lxc-freeze/unfreeze for example)
