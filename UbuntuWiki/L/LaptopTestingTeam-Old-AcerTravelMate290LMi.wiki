==== Notes ====
Hoary: Special Keys worked after adding keycodes + XmodMap

Breezy: I dont need to make any changes in XmodMap. I only have to modify the xorg.conf file for the horizontal and vertical scroll in the touchpad. For a external monitor I use: i810switch, with this you can use an external monitor.
