==== Notes ====

===== Friday July, 6th 2007 =====

* made a fresh install of Unbuntu Feisty Fawn (v7.04)
* in ''System -> Preferences -> Appearance'', in ''Font'', I selected "subpixel smoothing (LCD)"
* in ''System -> Preferences -> Keyboard'', in ''Layout Options'', I added the euro sign to key '5'
* tip: to use accentuated characters, in ''System -> Preferences -> Keyboard'', in ''Layouts'', set the keyboard model to "Generic 105-key (Intl) PC" and use the "US English International (with dead keys)" layout. Then type on the accent you want, release the key, and type on the letter, e.g. ^ + e = ê.

===== Thursday July, 12th 2007 =====

* in ''System -> Preferences > Hardware Information'': submitted data into the Ubuntu Device Database
* my submission ID is: <code>397ef3e1abd5ff1e1678d90ecb077d8d</code> as returned by <code>hwdb-gui -h</code>

===== Friday, October 19th 2007 =====

* upgraded to Ubuntu Gutsy Gibbon (v7.10): this fixed the Power Manager issue introduced when upgrading from Edgy to Feisty

===== Tuesday, December 4th 2007 =====

It's been a couple days since my wireless card has not been able to scan local networks. Using <code>dmesg</code>, I noticed that the system had recorded error messages like:
<pre>
(...) ipw2200: Detected Intel PRO/Wireless 2200BG Network Connection
(...) ipw2200: Radio Frequency Kill Switch is On:
(...) Kill switch must be turned off for wireless networking to work.
</pre>

or:
<pre>
(...) ipw2200: Firmware error detected.  Restarting.
</pre>

I searched on the Ubuntu forums and found out that the RF switch on the front of the laptop was in cause. So I installed the Acer Hotkey driver for Linux which is found at: http://www.cakey.de/acerhk/ and I modified my ipw2200 options too.

Now the wifi works like a charm and the WLAN led is either ON or blinking when no connection is active, just as it was in Windows.
