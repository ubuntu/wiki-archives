=== Current Issues ===

Kernel crash on bootup from 8.04 alpha 3 desktop CD (x86).  Determined this was a result of insufficient ram for the installer, but I think Ubuntu should have a warning instead of a crash.  Took two photographs of the screen at crash:

Downloaded the alternative installer instead and that worked well.
