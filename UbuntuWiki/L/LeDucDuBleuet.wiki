=== About me ===
I am mostly interested in free technologies advocacy (including formats, content, licensing) & training for new users, with an emphasis on security.

I also work as an "open-technologies" advocate & coach (software, hardware, formats, licenses) in and around Chicoutimi, QC, Canada, focusing on security and migration issues.

=== Plans & vision for Ubuntu ===
I see Ubuntu becoming an essential tool to make Gnu/Linux more accessible to everyone, starting with my parents and close friends. I feel it's a community that is open enough to let anyone participate to the extent of their abilities and availability.

==== In Quebec, as part of the Ubuntu-QC team ====
* Actively marketing and selling Ubuntu-related services locally:
* * Desktop migration and support
* * Training
* Participating or organizing events with Ubuntu mentions / presence
