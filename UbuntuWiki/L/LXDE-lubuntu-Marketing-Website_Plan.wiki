Branstorming of ideas for the Website lubuntu.net 

* Is it worth approaching Canonical to assist with the hosting of the site? As we are now official it might be something they'd consider to help out with? - <nowiki>[[JaredNorris]]</nowiki>
** I have talked to Lance and Mike from http://osuosl.org . They are happy to host the site. I am working together with them at the moment to move the current system to their servers. Secondly, Simone Brunozzi from Amazon helped us to get support from Amazon. They sponsor 500USD for lubuntu to use Amazon cloud to be used until Nov. 2012. The idea is to set up the site on osuosl and use Amazon as a mirror. <nowiki>[[mariobehling]]</nowiki>

* Need to decide what the web site is for, and how it relates to wiki content at both wiki.ubuntu.com and help.ubuntu.com <nowiki>[[JonathanMarsden]]</nowiki>

* Possible to clone (i.e. download copy recursively or ask for copy from site maintainer) a lubuntu website from the xubuntu one? Deals with web design issues and we can get on with content. <nowiki>[[MichaelRawson]]</nowiki>

* While a larger overhaul is awaited, can the present site at least have some '''minimal maintenance'''? The banner below the main logo could very quickly get (1) a '''new wee graphic'''' to replace the young woman looking at her colouring book, and (2) '''revise the text''' to reflect Lubuntu's current status (i.e., delete "The lubuntu team aims to earn official endorsement from Canonical."). (I write as a relieved new user, stuck on Ubuntu 9.04 for two years. Lubuntu gave me a current release that WORKS on my machine. The website was my first port of call, and it didn't beckon me in. :) Looking forward to the website overhaul making swift progress!) <nowiki>[[djreimer]]</nowiki>

* '''Keep it simple!''' Example of categories: 
** About - A small introduction of the project, screenshot of the desktop & one running application showing the theme.
** Download - Pretty straight forward.
** Get Involved - Redirect users to appropriate places.
** Help & Support - Redirect users to appropriate places. <nowiki>[[frankbooth]]</nowiki>

* It should be possible to marry the quite lovely <nowiki>[[http://i.imgur.com/6mfma.png|mockup]]</nowiki> with the thoughtful content <nowiki>[[https://sites.google.com/site/lubuntunet/|suggestion]]</nowiki>. My own sense is that the ''primary'' purpose of the site is a shop window for new and potential users; it's ''secondary'' purpose is to serve the existing community. With that in mind, the "tab" contents could be:
** '''Home''' - as both have it now
** '''About''' = "what makes it special" in content mockup + feature tour
** '''Download''' - from art mockup, combining both "Trying" and "Installing" from content mockup
** '''???''' - something that incorporates the content mockup "Modifying", but that is really not far from the "Wiki" sort of content of the art mockup. But calling it "Wiki" doesn't really say what's there for newer explorers; and calling it "Modifying" might suggest you need to hack the core. "Personalizing"? "Going Deeper"? ???
** '''Community''' - with team/people info, pointers to support etc.
This gives some sort of "narrative flow", as in the content mockup, but within the "layout" displayed by the (quite lovely) art mockup. FWIW. <nowiki>[[djreimer]]</nowiki>

* Some non ordered ideas :
** Rebase on a clean Drupal installation and theme
** Use as much as possible wiki pages
** Agregate informations from social networks (twitter, google + facebook ...)
** Add a planet
** Decide organization for people allowed to modify the content (set up a team ?) - <nowiki>[[gilir]]</nowiki>
