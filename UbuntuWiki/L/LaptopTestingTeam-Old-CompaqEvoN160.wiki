=== Current Issues and Regressions ===
This laptop requires an updated DSDT for the fan, the battery status, hibernate,
screen dimming or DMA on the HDD to work correctly.

Under Breezy Badger, the CD-R drive is extremely noisy, it spins up to full
speed (24x) and never spins down until the media is ejected. Under Hoary Hedgehog
the drive would only make noise when reading large chunks of data.
