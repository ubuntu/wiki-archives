==== Notes ====
Wifi : bcm43xx work bad (need to downgrade mem=1024M at boot). I use ndiswrapper instead <<BR>>
way to make it working (at this time) : prepare ndiswrapper, modprobe bcm43xx, modprobe ndiswrapper, rmmod bcm43xx, rmmod ndiswrapper THEN modprobe ndiswrapper. <<BR>>

If bcm43xx not loaded first, then ndiswrapper make event/0 taking all processor. <<BR>>
If bcm43xx not unloaded, going to freeze in minutes <<BR>>
Ndiswrapper won't work until rmmod/modprobe <<BR>>

With Ubuntu Edgy Eft and bcm43xx-fwcutter package, the default bcm43xx kernel module works well. It however sometimes does kernel panics. Ndiswrapper is no longer useful.

Mouse: some times need to HALT then restart computer (mouse plugin), else no usb mouse detection (use noapic nolapic parameters to kernel to avoid this) <<BR>>

NVidia driver currently bugs. You need to use the beta driver of Nvidia to use 3D applications.

The touchpad works well, but need to be configured using synaptics.
