==== Notes ====

- A few notes from my experience: 

  - Wifi worked outta the box with Network Manager. Wifi button light stays on 'Amber' does not change to 'Blue'. This may confuse a user that wifi is not working when it really is.

  - ^1^Bluetooth: Bluetooth module is not included in laptop. I'm using an external usb one. Works great. I have to re-plug in each time I reboot though...
  - ^2^Suspend: Suspend function does not work. Screen goes blank with blinking cursor on top left, with no options except to do a forceful shutdown via power button.
