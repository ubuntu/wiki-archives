==== Edgy Notes ====
* The X server restarts itself when the lid is closed and then opened. This defeats the purpose, as any open applications get killed in the process.
* I'm not sure what Fn+F5 is. The icon is two boxes, side-by-side, with an A in them, separated by a slash. The right box is an colour-inverted version of the left. Any ideas?
* With BIOS version A16 it refuses to come out of sleep. The screen shows corrupted rubbish and the Num Lock and Caps Lock LEDs flash. (I've checked my RAM which is working fine.)

=== Feisty Notes ===
* When the lid gets closed it locks the screen and asks for a password when you get back
* With bios version A16 it now comes out of sleep in feisty.
* If you have the Mobility Radeon, both the ati and the radeon drivers work, I'm running the ati driver at the moment and it works with most low level opengl apps. As for this isn't the best. I can run basic opengl games, but don't expect anything great the ati drivers aren't the best. If you have the nvidia board, you probably have a bit better drivers. But since both boards are only 16 megs don't expect much.
* Beryl is not an option at all with the ATI Card, if you want to play with it, the way it will work is if in your xorg.cfg you set your video memory to 32, but then still extremely slow and isn't quite stable since you are pretty much saying you twice as much video memory as you really have.
* To get SVIDEO working on the radeon mobility please refer to this article: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Radeon7500TVOut?highlight=%28atitvout%29
