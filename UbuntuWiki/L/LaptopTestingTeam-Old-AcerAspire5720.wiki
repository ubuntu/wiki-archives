=== Current Issues ===
* '''Moderate:''' Sound doesn't work out of the box (see below)
* '''Minor:''' Card reader isn't likely to work (Bug <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.20/+bug/88992|#88992]]</nowiki>)
* '''Minor:''' Compiz fusion won't work normally. See below.

=== Installing Sound ===
* download the package <nowiki>[[ftp:--152.104.238.19-pc-audio-realtek-linux-audiopack-5.01.tar.bz2]]</nowiki>. Do not use the install script provided, but manually compile the drivers only (Installation won't work because of alsaconf)
* Install curses and linux headers 

 `sudo apt-get install build-essential ncurses-dev`

 `sudo apt-get install linux-headers-\`uname -r\``

* Compile the content of alsa-driver-rt20071002.tar.bz2

 `tar xjf realtek-linux-audiopack-4.07a.tar.bz2`

 `cd realtek-linux-audiopack`

 `tar xjf alsa-driver-rt20071002.tar.bz2`

 `cd alsa-driver-rt20071002`

 `sudo ./configure`

 `sudo make`

 `sudo make install`

* edit the file `/etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base`

 `sudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base`

* At the end of the file, add the line:

 `options snd-hda-intel model=acer`

=== Compiz Fusion ===

 To get Compiz-fusion working, you need to invoke it like this: 

 `SKIP_CHECKS=yes compiz --replace`

 You can create a little script and put invoke it with the gnome session manager.

 PS: If the totem, mplyer and others movie players didn't work, try install xserver-xgl or reconfigure your players (http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=507328&highlight=compiz+totem+playback).
