==== Breezy / Dapper Notes ====

Tried to install from Dapper Flight 4 Live CD, it discovered my LVM shares and allowed me to select exiting LVs, but wouldn't let me create a new LV, limitation of the partitioning tool.  After executing the install, it seemed the installer hung indefinately at 72%, could just be my impatient, cancelled out of the install, and rebooted fine into Breezy

Installed Dapper from Flight 4 Install CD, to an already created LV to dual boot Breezy/Dapper, installation went fine, no hangups, just slow at certain points.  Better feedback it seems in the Install CD than the LiveCD install.

Upon first boot, the resolution was 1024x768 which is blurry on the WXGA screen.  xorg.conf was configured correctly, needed to run 915resolution (new in Dapper, was 855resolution in Breezy)

Added to /etc/default/915resolution:
Mode=7e
XRESU=1280
YRESU=800

Reboot, correct resolution displayed.  

* WirelessNIC - DELL Wi/Fi LED does not activate in Dapper or Feisty.  Antenna not disabled with the hotkey

* * Use the speedstep_centrino and cpufreq_ondemand kernel modules for the best frequency scaling results in Dapper.

Enabled Suspend to test lid close.
Suspended with Lid close, Came alive with Open.  
Wired Network retrieved a DHCP IP (slow on my network)
Hibernate with Lid close, worked, Came alive with Open
Wired Network retrieved a DHCP IP (slow on my network)
* A HAL notify window popped up on restart that said hibernate failed... then went away, without interaction.

==== Jaunty Notes ====
* The Intel 855GM driver was no longer supported by Intel. Coupled with the switch from EXA to UXA, caused 3D acceleration to stop working completely. It is advised that you upgrade directly to Karmic, or stick with Intrepid in the interim.

==== Karmic Notes ====
* Switching from AC to Battery causes monitor to enter DPMS Standby mode, instead of dimming. Upon keyboard or mouse interaction, screen comes back to life with reduced brightness
