__TOC__

LX Ambiance is a theme for open box designed to mimic the default Ubuntu theme with dark window borders and orange buttons.
This theme is free to distribute and modify, and is MIT licensed.

I would like to have this theme included in the 14.04 release of Lubuntu so users can easily switch to an openbox theme to make their computer look like Gnome 2 in Ubuntu 10.04.

I believe this will help users who have old computers have a nice window theme, and users who are displease with non-menu based DEs (Unity/Gnome3).
