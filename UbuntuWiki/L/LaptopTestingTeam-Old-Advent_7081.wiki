==== Notes ====
* There is no 3d acceleration onboard, and external monitors have worked on previous versions of Linux (suse, mandriva, slackware) However; I did not restart the xserver upon plugging in the external monitor

* *CeleronM Dothans do not support Hardware frequency scaling

* **All the keys marked with three stars do not work on the fly, but are recognized by Ubuntu  and are easily binded to functions in gnome.
