==== Notes ====
* Everything works with a bit of setting up.
* Fn keys are on by default so to get 'normal' Fn keys you need to press Fn.
* It is suggested to leave a small OS X installation available for firmware updates.
* https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MacBook is a good resource for initial setup.
