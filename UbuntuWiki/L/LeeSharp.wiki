=== About Me ===
I have been in the computer industry for far too long.  (My first OS was RSTS/E, which is scary)  I have been in and out of Unix and Linux for a long time, but Breezy Badger was the first viable Windows replacement for me.  I now make a living with independent consulting implementing open source projects, and providing networking design and support for small to medium businesses.  My niche seems to be businesses becomming medium, and needing help grwoing the IT systems out of small.
