==== Notes ====
The laptop is very functional in Linux in general, but it works fantastically in Ubuntu! However, the design of the laptop is not very good; the fans are placed on the bottom, meaning you can not place the laptop on any soft surfaces, if you do, you will need to replace the heat sink. And the top of the monitor scratches off the touchpad buttons and laptop cover. Although the hardware in this puppy gorgeous, I would not recommend the laptop to anyone else.

There are problems with suspend / resume and ACPI in bios V1.10. I will comment again after upgrading to 1.50.
