==== Notes ====

* *Problem with allocation of vmalloc space. System is crashing after about 10min of start. In /var/log/messages you can find:

'''''allocation failed: out of vmalloc space - use vmalloc=<size> to increase size'''''

Userful link: ''http://linux.derkeiler.com/Mailing-Lists/Kernel/2005-04/0746.html''

Run the following only if you'd experienced system freeze after couple of minutes after start!!
 
<pre>

gksu gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst

cat /proc/cmdline

cat /proc/meminfo |grep Vma
</pre>

* ** In case the microphone doesn't work don't forget to change "Input Source" to "Front Mic" in the sound applet.
