=== Current Issues ===
The touchpad model is ALPS, not Synaptics and it needs to be properly configured by hand. For Breezy, follow these instructions: <nowiki>[[http://ubuntu.wordpress.com/2005/11/15/fixing-my-alps-touchpad-with-the-synaptics-driver/]]</nowiki> (<nowiki>[[AndreaGamba]]</nowiki>)

==== Notes ====
The keycode column shows the keycode as obtained from gnome-keybinding-properties, or the scancode sequence from the kernel log when the keycode is unknown to the kernel.

The special multimedia keys are completely undetected, they don't even show up in the kernel log. Trying with these <nowiki>[[http://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/laptop-testing-team/2006-January/000340.html|Hotkey testing]]</nowiki> tips was useless, the wistron_btns driver does not do anything for this hardware.

All tests were performed with an out-of-the box configuration, unless otherwise stated.
