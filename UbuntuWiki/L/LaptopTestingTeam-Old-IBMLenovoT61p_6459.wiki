=== Current Issues ===
Unable to install 7.10 Desktop AMD64 Final (or 7.10 Desktop i386 Final).  System hangs after loading kernel from install CD.  Safe Video Mode selection eventually displays the message "The display server has been shutdown about 6 times in the last 90 seconds.  It is likely that something bad is going on.  Wait for 2 minutes before trying again on display 0."

This system: NVidia QuadroFX570M 256MB, Intel Core 2 Duo T7700, 1GB Intel Robson Card, 4GB RAM, & 15" WUXGA LCD.

MS Windows XP and Vista both run fine, so it doesn't appear to be a hardware problem.
