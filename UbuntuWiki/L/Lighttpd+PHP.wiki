__TOC__

This is a how-to to on installing and setting up lighttpd and PHP on Maverick.
<nowiki>[[http://www.lighttpd.net/|Lighttpd]]</nowiki> or "lighty" is a webserver with a very low use of resources.

Install the packages we need: (this may not be all, but these two will automatically download the rest as dependencies)
<pre>
sudo apt-get install lighttpd php5-cgi
</pre>
Enable the fastcgi module and the php configuration with
<pre>
sudo lighty-enable-mod fastcgi 
sudo lighty-enable-mod fastcgi-php
</pre>
Reload the lighttpd daemon
<pre>
sudo service lighttpd force-reload
</pre>

To test if it's working create the file `/var/www/index.php` with the following contents:
<pre>
<?php phpinfo(); ?>
</pre>
and check out <nowiki>[[http://localhost/index.php]]</nowiki> in your browser.
