Ubuntu 6.06 tested with a 800MHz Celeron, 384MB SO-DIMM RAM, QSI SDR-081 DVDROM and a floppy drive.

=== Current Issues ===
Suspend and Hibernate don't work (will investigate). Power management only works with acpi=force ( https://launchpad.net/bugs/38174 ). Synaptics Touchpad detected as mouse ( https://launchpad.net/bugs/36958 ). Most of the special function keys don't work. 

The alternate install cd of any Hardy 8.04 version freezes on boot. To solve use fb=false option on boot options (F6 key).

==== Notes ====
Well catered-for laptop. Nearly everything works out-of-the-box on Dapper - graphics (with DRI), sound, networking, wireless networking... If you're searching for a WiFi PCMCIA card for this laptop, I can recommend D-Link DWL-650+ (acx100).
