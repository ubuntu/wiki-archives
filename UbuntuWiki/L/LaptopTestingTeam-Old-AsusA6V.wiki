==== Notes ====

===== Dapper Drake 6.06 LTS =====

[8]: Add at the bottom of the file ''/etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base'' to get the headphone jack working: <pre>
options snd-hda-intel model=z71v position_fix=1
</pre> In gnome-volume-control is a panel for the headphone (probably it is muted).

===== Dapper Drake 6.06 Beta 2 =====

[1]: At the first boot after the installation ubuntu Dapper Drake shows only a black display - the X driver doesn't work out-of-the-box. When installing ATI proprietary driver package all things work.

[2]: By pressing Fn key + Ins the numpad led lights up/down, but the numpad doesn't work.

[3]: The button locks the monitor.

===== Breezy Badger 5.10 =====

[4]: The installation works correctly, but at the first boot the system hangs while starting hotplug subsystem.

[5]: The X driver doesn't work out-of-the-box. When installing ATI proprietary driver package X starts correctly.

[6]: It can't be switched to display mode 1280x800. It has to add manually to xorg.conf.

[7]: The snd-hda-intel doesn't work. After installing the sound driver manually the sound worked (for example the Fn keys).
