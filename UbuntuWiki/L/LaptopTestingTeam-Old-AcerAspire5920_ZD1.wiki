==== Notes ====
1) The above tests were made with Hardy Heron x86_64 and x86

2) Installation with language other than english needs an Internet connection during install phase or you have to add the language after installation ends (this is a general bug not specific to this laptop)

3) To enable sound you have to add "Surround" track (and then enable it) from volume control preferences (right click on volume icon, on the gnome bar, -> open volume control -> edit -> preferences)

4) To enable built-in microphone you have to add "Front Mic Boost" and "Capture" tracks (follow the above instructions to enable them). Then from recorder software (for example gnome-sound-recorder) you can select "capture" or " front mic boost". The other microphone related tracks (front, mic boost and front mic) seem can be safely removed.
