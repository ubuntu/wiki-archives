| Community training in Ubuntu is something critical to its success as a distribution but as it stands training can be hard to find, difficult to attend due to timezone issues, and has widely varying methods of implementation. The intention of this project is to develop a platform that acts as an umbrella for all community based training to resolve three existing problems identified with the training specifically:<<BR>> * The training is difficult for new users to locate.<<BR>>* The training is often difficult to attend due to timezone issues.<<BR>>* The quality and manner of training inconsistent.<<BR>><<BR>>From the broader community perspective the project intends to resolve issues currently restricting the further development and uptake that need to be addressed:<<BR>>* Improve the retention rate for new users<<BR>>* Improve the amount of users contributing to the distribution<<BR>>* Equip users to be able to advocate for Ubuntu<<BR>>* Equip sysadmins with the knowledge to implement Ubuntu based desktops at work.

| Currently training there is no 'true' community training resource; there are wiki articles, forum how-to posts and IRC sessions, but none of this is tied together in and 'bound' in to a 'course'. The vision I have for this project is to use Moodle to build courseware that makes use of the fantastic resources available and provides a logical progression of topics that build a person's knowledge and skill. I also feel that with such resources available that the following outcomes can be achieved:<<BR>> * New users will have an easier time making the transition <<BR>> * Organizations will have an easier time adopting Ubuntu <<BR>> * Users who want to contribute to the Ubuntu community will be able to grow their skills  <<BR>> * Self-Paced courses will bridge the 'timezone gap' that prevents some folks from getting the training they desire.

| I would like to see community organised and content creation which provides a way to teach physical classes about all areas of ubuntu and foss use, management, development and advocacy. My primary aims are in lesson plans, hand out sheets, pre-reading materials and links and help with teaching new teachers how to teach.
