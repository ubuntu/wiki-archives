==== Notes ====
None of the volume keys properly trigger UI, though they all perform the correct hardware functions, though you can install tpb for a UI using xosd. They did trigger the GNOME volume control, however controlling two volume controls at once seems bad, so I unbound those in Keyboard Shortcuts.

==== Current Issues ====
I've just upgraded from the last Breezy development version (and before it from Hoary) to the final version, and as yet have encountered no problems. Everything seems to work as before, and the changes seem to have meshed fine. This page is very much a work in progress, but I thought it was worth scribbing a few notes on how things were working on a much older machine.

==== Hardware details ====
** IBM Thinkpad T22 laptop
** 900mb P3 processor
** 384m RAM (1x256 and 1x128)
** 40gb Hard Drive
Everything else as per how the laptop was on purchase.

==== Notes ====
From what I can see, everything is working fine. X starts up without issue, and all updated applications work fine. My Belkin Wireless card that took a great deal of work to kick into life under Hoary works out of the box, and both the suspend and hibenate funtions do what they are meant to. I've just installed a load of software via an old shell script (Konqueror, Dia, Thunderbird, Xemacs, Audacity and a few other things) and then tried apt-getting a selection of other things I needed (Nvu being the main thing I needed immediatly). In all cases the software installed with out me having to intervene (I do use -y as standard), and I've not encountered any bugs as yet. All I can really find fault with is that apt-getting TuxRacer didn't give me an icon as default in the Gnome menu. This level of hair-splitting can only be a good thing I feel.

This laptop has worked well with Ubuntu over the past year, and there is nothing obvious that does not work. I know this is not hugely useful, but at least it goes to show that Ubuntu can integrate seamlessly with technology that outdates it.

Boot speed is about 30 seconds faster, and if there is no wireless card/ethernet plugged in, then this time doesn't change (wheras before it hung for a good 30 seconds extra while it was noticing that there was no viable network connection)
