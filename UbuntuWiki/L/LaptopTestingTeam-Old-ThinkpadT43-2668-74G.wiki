==== Notes ====
* Hi Christian. I noticed this page go up: does you machine have different specifications to the other Thinkpad T43's being tested? If not, you might like to coordinate your testing with the people who have the similar machine to you! Thanks very much for testing :) <nowiki>[[mdke]]</nowiki>
