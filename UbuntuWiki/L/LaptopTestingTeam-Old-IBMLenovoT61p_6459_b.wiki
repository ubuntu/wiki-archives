__TOC__

* Contact: McLogic/Nathan Dbb
* Make:    IBM/Lenovo
* Brand:   ThinkPad
* Model:   T61p 6459CTO
NOTE: AS the 6459 is the CTO (configure to order) option, computers with this model number will have lots of different parts in them. I got CTO as I wanted Microsoft Windows XP and not Vista. At the time Vista would not run under VMware reliably.

=== Current Issues ===
The right two (of the computer's 3) USB ports stop working about 5 min after the computer boots. Only the single left-hand side USB port keeps working. This is really annoying. This is true in 7.10 and 8.04 Alpha-6.

Unable to get Quadro FX570M 256 MB working with suspend and hibernate (worked on it for 15 min). As suspend and hibernate are much more important then video 3D (compiz is the worst garbage ever installed on my desktop system), I run the VESA Driver.

I do think that <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CompositeByDefault|compiz-by-default]]</nowiki> is the worst decision that Ubuntu has ever made. The regressions in video and 3D are huge for normal users.

=== System Info ===

This system: NVidia QuadroFX570M 256MB, Intel Core 2 Duo T7300 (2.0GHz 4 MiB), 4GiB RAM, & 15" WUXGA LCD.

==== Notes ====
MS Windows XP run fine, so it doesn't appear to be a hardware problem.

With the extended battery, '''Microsoft Windows XP will run for 3.5 hours. Ubuntu 7.10 will only run for 2 hours'''. This is a huge PITA, and keeps me using windows to read/watch on a flight.

Many people have had trouble with the right-side USB ports not working after about 6 min. This is due to a BIOS bug, in conjunction with the way Linux ignores devices that throw excessive interrupts while Windows tolerates them. Lenovo has released a BIOS fix (7 months after laptop release), but it shows how ThinkPad quality has fallen.
