=== Current Issues ===
* '''Critical:''' Wireless with the ipw2200 driver is restarting due to firmware error, making wireless connectivity impossible. (Bug <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.15/+bug/27778|#27778]]</nowiki>)
* '''Moderate:''' None of the function keys work. (Bug <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/hotkey-setup/+bug/20727|#20727]]</nowiki>)
* '''Minor:''' Card reader isn't likely to work, no Linux driver available. (Bug <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.15/+bug/20964|#14733]]</nowiki>)

=== Restoring Network/USB (Dapper) ===
If you install and find yourself without networking and/or USB access and some really funky dmesg output, follow the instructions below.

* Boot with pci=noacpi and irqpoll
* This will make your ethernet and USB drives work. You can then apt-get update and dist-upgrade to get the latest kernel.
* Upgrade your BIOS to 1.70. This gets around a measure that forces pci=noacpi for BIOS version 1.60 which actually appears to make things worse. The best way to do this is to download the BIOS update from the <nowiki>[[http://www.csd.toshiba.com/cgi-bin/tais/su/su_sc_modItemList.jsp?moid=882431&ct=DL&BV_SessionID=@@@@0826807346.1150474590@@@@&BV_EngineID=ccceaddidhglgejcgfkceghdgngdgmm.0|Toshiba Tecra A4 Download Page]]</nowiki>, install it, navigate to C:\ta4av16 (default location), and burn the ta4av16.iso to a CD using your favorite burner utility. Restart and re-flash from the CD.
* Restart, enjoy ethernet and USB.
