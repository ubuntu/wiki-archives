=== Add uDuck to Your Browser ===
<nowiki>[[File:uduck.png|alt text|width=100]]</nowiki>

<nowiki>[[uDuck|SIMPLE SETUP INSTRUCTIONS HERE]]</nowiki>.
 Add uDuck to your Browser, both as a part of your '''Searchbar''' and on your '''Bookmarks Toolbar'''.  
 LXLE's help tool, uDuck, in the <nowiki>[[https://duckduckgo.com/|DuckDuckGo search engine]]</nowiki>, is an Ubuntu-based, meta search for help and support of any *buntu based distribution. 

 uDuck is focused on Ubuntu support areas, and chances are that your question will be answered here within seconds.
=== Help and Support Etiquette ===
Dedicated volunteers create the software you use, and other dedicated volunteers give their time to help you learn how to use it. In time, you will be able to "Pay It Forward", and help others on their journey.

LXLE provides personal support in mailing lists, chat rooms, and its Forums.  However, you will soon discover that people are more likely to help you if you've done research before asking your questions.  Many of your questions will be frequently asked questions (FAQs,) and those FAQs can be found simply in uDuck. 

Please do the best you can to try and solve your problems with uDuck, first, before asking the friendly support people.  If nobody answers you right away, you might assume that your question is probably a FAQ.

=== Conky Configuration ===
==== Hide and Show Conky Toggle ====

There has been a known bug in the LXDE panel plugin to hide all windows and show the desktop. Otherwise known as '''Show Desktop'''. This bug entails '''conky''' and the way the plugin treats open windows. The plugin believes '''conky''' is a window, regardless of what type of internal configuration is set.

The '''Hide/Show Info Tool''', located in the panel, works around this. You can also find it in your '''System Tools''' menu. Basically it tells the window to either appear or disappear. 

How does this help with the bug?  If you hit the '''Show Desktop''' plugin in the menu bar, '''conky''' will surely go with it. To get it back, just make sure to have any program or window showing, and then '''click''' the '''Hide/Show Info Tool''' button. 

This workaround also comes in handy when in the Lubuntu-Netbook mode. Conky would normally be blocking and covering some of the screen while looking quite awful. Thankfully, you can just click the same '''Hide/Show Info Tool''' button to make it disappear.

==== Network Activity ====

# Go to the programs menu > Accessories > '''ROXTerm'''
# '''Copy/Paste''' the following command line snippet into '''ROXTerm''' then press '''Enter''':
  .`gedit ~/.conkyrc`
# '''Find All''' “eth0” (without the quotes.)
# '''Change to''' your connection, usually one of these: “eth0, eth1, wlan0, wlan1, wlan2”.
# This information can also be easily found in '''network connections'''.
# Once changed just '''save''' and exit.

==== Stop Conky at Startup ====
# Go to the programs menu > Preferences > '''Desktop Session Settings'''
# '''Uncheck''' which ever program you don't want to run at startup.
# Click '''OK'''
If you want to '''renable''' the conky, just repeat, but '''check''' instead of uncheck.

== How To Update All Versions ==
=== Easy Method: Automatic Update Reminder and Update Manager ===
These two programs work together to ensure that you have the latest updates from the Linux community and your distribution.  Follow the prompts, as they pop up on your desktop to remind you.  

You can change the timing of the Update Reminder by following the instructions in the Configuration guides, above.

=== Best Method: Synaptic Package Manager ===

The LXLE team recommends that you learn to use the Synaptic Package Manager, period.  This full featured update manager is also the recommended way to install programs, remove programs, and other tasks involving your packages. 

Using the Synaptic Package Manager, as a beginner/intermediate user, will prevent you from making many mistakes that you might not know how to correct.  Advanced users may use their terminals for command snippets they are familiar with; however, if you need to rely on help and support volunteers, while you learn things, it will be exceedingly difficult for them to help you, not knowing what you entered into your terminal.

'''Simple update with Synaptic Package Manager:'''
# Open the program.
# Start menu/System Tools/Synaptic Package Manager.
# Enter your password.
# After it opens, Click on RELOAD.
# Allow it to do its search, then Click on MARK ALL UPGRADES.
# If there are upgrades to do, if any were marked, then Click on the GREEN ARROW - APPLY.
# Close the program.
