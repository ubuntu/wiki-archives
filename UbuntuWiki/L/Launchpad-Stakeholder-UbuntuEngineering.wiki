| Bug:605293
| bug watches for archived debian bug reports appear not to exist
| budmurray: '''DA prio''': They are actually showing up as Fix Released now which is wrong and makes it very hard to tell from what set of bugs we may be able to find a fix upstream.
|-
| Bug:846003
| janitor shouldn't blindly set duplicate bugs to Fix Released
| bdmurray: '''DA prio''': Brian found about 232 cases where the janitor, using changelog info, set a duplicate bug to Fix Released.  That's 232 less bugs!  Really the janitor knows or can know whether or not a bug is a duplicate and should do something smarter.
|-
| Bug:456502
| bug to question not available in the API
| bdmurray: '''DA prio:''' You have to use the web interface to convert a bug to a question and converting a bug to question would be useful for enforcing a minimum bug quality.

|-
| Bug:827912
| Ubuntu bugs marked "Fix released" before fix is generally available
| closing on upload is not correct dynamic,  should be closing on publishing
|-
| Bug:730610
| Message sharing should prioritize messages from the current distro
| dpm: High: Right now the latest package upload with translations, regardless of the distro series, will be used as the source for current translations and these translations get propagated to all series. This means that a Lucid upload will take over as the current source of translations over Natty. This tends to confuse translators and overwrite their fixes (i.e. data loss) done in Launchpad.
|-
| Bug:775701
| Sharing details page: automatic synchronization detection needs to be aware of LP usage
| dpm: high: We want this feature to be used for both external projects and for projects hosted in Launchpad. Right now projects in Launchpad are expected to do automatic imports of both translations and templates to use the feature, where it should be possible for them to just import templates to do upstream sharing. Importing both templates and translations is not only a bit of a waste, but unless the maintainers are really active in fetching translations from Ubuntu -which is not generally the case-, it can lead to overwriting new translation data with old one. A common example is the case where translations are automatically imported, but out of sync with newer translations from Ubuntu: in that case upstream imports have got precedence and will overwrite newer Ubuntu translations.
|-
| Bug:490668
| "Bouncing" between branch imports and branch exports
| dpm: medium:  This hasn't got directly to do with upstream translations sharing, but it might become more of an issue when upstream sharing gets widely used and translations precedence starts kicking in. It'd be great if upstream maintainers in Launchpad could fully automate the translations process, and having the same branch for translations imports and exports is the way to go. However, they cannot use this feature right now, due to commits being done even if translations have not changed.

== Features ==

1. Bug Lifecycle and Developer/Triager Workflow Improvements: https://dev.launchpad.net/LEP/BugLifecycle
** https://blueprints.launchpad.net/launchpad/+spec/other-o-bug-lifecycle
*** automate state transitions based on evidence available, rather than manual intervention (Bug:777874 Bug:877853 were steps toward this, but much more extensive should be possible - Bug:830180)
*** bug survey conducted, 8/24 results. 
** 20111103 - https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/other-p-bug-workflows
*** consistency for states between teams so effective aggregation (common interpretation of states, incomplete, fix committed, fix released (eg. Bug:827912))
*** standardize notation for expressing state transition
** 2011117 - per stakeholders meeting,  agreement that Francis will help ensure merged model is implementable before we survey back to teams for feedback.

1. Bug Series Cleanup: https://dev.launchpad.net/LEP/OnlySeriesTasks
** 20111103 - https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/other-p-bugtaskseries
*** Underlying common problems for SRU & CVE bugs  (bugs escalated: Bug:314432, Bug:777861, ...)
** 20111117 - per stakeholders meeting will be handled as part of maintenance.

1. Help Upstream Bug: https://dev.launchpad.net/LEP/BugzillaComponents
** better handoff of bugs to upstream, and detection of fixes from upstream (improve fix detection: Bug:605293)
** 20111117 - per stakeholders, agreement this should be considered for roadmap

1. Improved Bug Search Capabilities
** 2011117 - if scope of escalated bugs exceeds maintenance squad capability,  need to look at getting this added.

=== Undefined ===

1. A way to mark bugs as fixed (no longer in progress), but waiting for a merge (not yet fix committed)
*** Probably should be folded into Kate's Bug Status rework plans

1. Opening a new distrorelease before releasing the previous one (shortcoming relative to former dak infrastructure)
** Tracked at: '''https://bugs.launchpad.net/soyuz/+bug/87012'''
** Rationale: When opening a new distrorelease, uploads must be temporarily blocked until the toolchain and other basic infrastructure are in place.  Opening the new release early would allow this work to happen in parallel, so that the new release would be immediately open for development.

** Status:
** PPAs make it possible to do some of the preparatory work for a new distro series
** Fully handling this was not targeted for Launchpad 4.0
** Need to investigate current status of this need, and raise it through the bug escalation process

1. Notifying the release team of new milestone targets
** Tracked at: '''???'''
** Rationale: The release team tracks outstanding targets for milestones and their resolution.  However, they currently must poll in order to obtain this information.  Asynchronous notification would be more efficient.

** Status:
** Structural subscriptions were targeted for Launchpad 2.0  (2009-08-03: update, anyone?  Do we push notification now?)
** Hand this one to the Ubuntu Engineering stakeholder list
