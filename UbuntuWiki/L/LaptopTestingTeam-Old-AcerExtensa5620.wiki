==== Notes ====
* In Hardy 64-bit Final, extend screen works much like mirror screen, but adds overhanging area to the higher-resolution screen.
* The inbuilt card reader works fine with SD and MMC cards, but currently doesn't work with memory sticks, XD and SmartMedia cards. Development of a driver for these cards types is at <nowiki>[[http://openfacts.berlios.de/index-en.phtml?title=TI%20FlashMedia%20xx12%2Fxx21%20driver]]</nowiki>
* The acer e-settings, acer e-application keys and user programmable "P" key are registered, but no functions are assigned to them.
* I strongly suggest updating the firmware on the laptop - I had problems with some key combinations (eg, ctrl+shift+cursor keys would only register sporadically), until I updated to the latest firmware (v 1.32). You need to download these from the <nowiki>[[http://support.acer-euro.com/drivers/notebook/ex_5620.html|acer uk support]]</nowiki> site, and will probably need Windows installed in order to perform the upgrade.
