| Probably proprietary - not output from either `acpi_listen` nor in `xev` nor in `/lib/udev/keymap -i input/event5` when I flip it (right/left), although it does turn on/off the front panel led for wifi, but has absolutely no effect in Linux
|-

| No

| No
| Probably proprietary (same as note on WLAN switch above - has no effect in Linux, and I don’t think alsa is going to fix/support this anytime in the near future either
