=== Current Issues ===
-With the LTS release, most problems which occured with flight 7 and suspend seem to have been fixed.  Hiberate seems to still be hit or miss, but suspend now appears to work properly.  Sometimes the wireless connection does not come back up after suspend, but disabling it in software before closing the lid seems to fix this intermittent issue.
