==== Notes ====
Beryl works in edgy through AIGLX on my Radeon Mobility 7500, but not at widescreen resolutions.  Widescreen doesn't freeze, but you can't really read anything.

another x1000 user comment on Fiesty:
Beryl is not smooth (Mobility FireGL 9000) but widescreen resolution (1280x800) does not seems to be a problem for me.

Hibernate fails to work. (it works on my machine with FC6). Suspend (to ram) works although this event is not binded with closing of lid. Closing of lid simply leads to screen lock.
