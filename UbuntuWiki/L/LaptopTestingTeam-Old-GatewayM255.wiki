==== Notes ====

* Does not recognize correct screen resolution on its own. Need to  install 915resolution to make it work.
* Once sound has been muted (using Fn+Home), it cannot be enabled again.
* Need to install NetworkManager -- otherwise one cannot switch between wired and wireless network.
* OpenOffice has an issue with fonts being displayed badly. Enabling subpixel smoothing helps, but does not completely resolve issue.
* There seems to be no way to use the correct resolution on an external screen -- it can use only those resolutions that are supported by internal screen. 
* Some of the Fn keys make system crash.
* System sometimes hangs during booting.
