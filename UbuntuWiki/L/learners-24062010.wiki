* bgs100 [Jun 24 19:44:57] notices time!
<bgs100>	[Jun 24 19:45:02] pedro3005 ?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 24 19:45:10] yes
* bgs100 [Jun 24 19:45:22] assumes sedios was eaten by black hole
<pedro3005>	[Jun 24 19:45:40] yeah, tragic
<Snova>	[Jun 24 19:47:33] we might see him again, but we'll have to postpone the lesson for a while...
<bgs100>	[Jun 24 19:47:51] Haha
<bgs100>	[Jun 24 19:49:11] -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= C class begin, I guess. 40 minutes late. :P =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
<bgs100>	[Jun 24 19:49:20] pedro3005, You asked for a relink? http://paste.pocoo.org/show/229638/
<pedro3005>	[Jun 24 19:52:16] bgs100, ok, I understand up to line... 9
<pedro3005>	[Jun 24 19:52:17] xD
<bgs100>	[Jun 24 19:52:54] We start a for loop.
<Snova>	[Jun 24 19:53:08] well, I *think* I know how it works; it's quite elegant in its simplicity
<bgs100>	[Jun 24 19:53:24] :|
<Snova>	[Jun 24 19:53:34] am I interrupting? :)
<bgs100>	[Jun 24 19:53:38] No
<bgs100>	[Jun 24 19:53:55] But having called it elegant and simple did slightly throw me :p
<bgs100>	[Jun 24 19:54:08] it called*
<bgs100>	[Jun 24 19:54:20] anyway, i is initalized to 0, and c to '\0' (which is 0 too :P)
<Snova>	[Jun 24 19:54:43] well, it's mostly just four lines... two of which are just loops
<bgs100>	[Jun 24 19:54:56] Yeah.
<Snova>	[Jun 24 19:55:19] however
<bgs100>	[Jun 24 19:55:25] What?
<Snova>	[Jun 24 19:55:42] I think, when the inner loop exits for EOF or \n, it will allocate an extra chunk
<Snova>	[Jun 24 19:56:05] that it doesn't need- so perhaps that realloc() call would do better before the inner loop, where it can also allocate the first chunk
<bgs100>	[Jun 24 19:57:10] Wow, good idea. Fixes a bug and removes some code.
<bgs100>	[Jun 24 19:57:34] Well, back to pedro3005
<Snova>	[Jun 24 19:58:15] to explain (sorry :p), it allocates memory in chunks of 20 bytes. "i" is the index into the memory that is the start of the last chunk (the one being filled in right now) and "j" is the index into /that/ chunk, so i+j is exactly where it's being filled in
<bgs100>	[Jun 24 19:58:58] :P yeah
<bgs100>	[Jun 24 19:59:25] And it keeps doing so until it hits an EOF or the specified delimiter.
<Snova>	[Jun 24 19:59:40] bgs100: also, the reason I called it "elegant and simple" is because if tasked to do this myself, I most certainly would not have come up with something so tidy (at least not on my first attempt)
<Snova>	[Jun 24 20:00:07] I'm not one for "complicated" loops, where "complicated" means just about anything more than one simple condition
* bgs100 [Jun 24 20:00:16] gives self star? :P
* Snova [Jun 24 20:00:53] gives bgs100 the Engineering Star
<bgs100>	[Jun 24 20:00:54] pedro3005, Also, it takes the FILE so you can use it on any file open for reading (as opposed to just stdin).
<bgs100>	[Jun 24 20:00:58] Yaaay
<Snova>	[Jun 24 20:01:11] there is very little to take away from this :p
<bgs100>	[Jun 24 20:02:19] pedro3005, And the other functions are just little convenience functions that give it parameters one might use often.
<bgs100>	[Jun 24 20:02:44] and then the purpose of main was just a test.
<bgs100>	[Jun 24 20:03:23] pedro3005, Okay?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 24 20:03:27] bgs100, how can I put it in some header file so I could do something like #include <bgs'hack> ? :P
<Snova>	[Jun 24 20:03:35] you wouldn't
<Snova>	[Jun 24 20:03:40] headers should not contain code
<bgs100>	[Jun 24 20:04:06] Snova, Remember when I tried to use include like import? :P
<Snova>	[Jun 24 20:04:20] not exactly; were you including C files?
<bgs100>	[Jun 24 20:04:27] Yes
<bgs100>	[Jun 24 20:04:46] Or naming C files with .h instead of .c
<Snova>	[Jun 24 20:04:59] well, technically .h files are C :p
<bgs100>	[Jun 24 20:05:08] *rolls eyes*
<pedro3005>	[Jun 24 20:05:54] bgs100, so then how do you import stuff in C?
<bgs100>	[Jun 24 20:06:03] include*
<pedro3005>	[Jun 24 20:06:19] import, include, use, get, whatever
<bgs100>	[Jun 24 20:07:33] pedro3005, Header files are used to declares the functions in C source/object code. When you #include a file, it's pretty much put there in your program. You then compile your code with the code you're using, or the object code. Unless you're using special .so type files, which I don't know much about.
<bgs100>	[Jun 24 20:07:39] declare*
<bgs100>	[Jun 24 20:07:45] Snova, Correct? :p
<pedro3005>	[Jun 24 20:08:23] So... they DO contain code?
<bgs100>	[Jun 24 20:08:52] Er
<bgs100>	[Jun 24 20:09:04] If you consider just declarations code
<pedro3005>	[Jun 24 20:09:28] it's not cheese, is it?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 24 20:09:31] >.>
<bgs100>	[Jun 24 20:09:42] lolwut
<pedro3005>	[Jun 24 20:10:01] so let me reformulate
<pedro3005>	[Jun 24 20:10:14] how do I stick this non-code into a header file?
<bgs100>	[Jun 24 20:11:36] You put it in there.
<Snova>	[Jun 24 20:11:49] pedro3005: you know how you were able to compile code that called a nonexistent function, but couldn't link it?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 24 20:12:06] how?
<Snova>	[Jun 24 20:12:14] you did it the other day; getcar()
<bgs100>	[Jun 24 20:12:25] That is, the function declarations. You'll need to remove the main() function.
<Snova>	[Jun 24 20:12:40] the purpose of a .h file is simply to inform the compiler of the existence of certain functions; their name and signatures
<Snova>	[Jun 24 20:12:57] all .c files are compiled separately without any further knowledge of each other than the function names they contain
<pedro3005>	[Jun 24 20:13:02] so where is the code for printf()?
<bgs100>	[Jun 24 20:13:02] And variables?
<Snova>	[Jun 24 20:13:27] the reason is that just parsing tons of C code is expensive, so the idea is to build each one separately with the bare minimum of information necessary for it to work
<Snova>	[Jun 24 20:13:31] that too
<Snova>	[Jun 24 20:13:39] pedro3005: /lib/libc-2.11.1.so
<pedro3005>	[Jun 24 20:13:56] Snova, so what I'm really looking after is a .so file?
<Snova>	[Jun 24 20:13:58] stdio.h contains exactly this: extern int printf (__const char *__restrict __format, ...);
<Snova>	[Jun 24 20:14:06] i.e. there is no code anymore
<bgs100>	[Jun 24 20:14:43] brb
<Snova>	[Jun 24 20:14:45] printf()'s *actual* source code implementation has long since been discarded; what you have left is compiled code in libc and its definition in stdio.h
<Snova>	[Jun 24 20:15:02] said definition is only necessary so that the compiler can tell you when you're using it wrong
<pedro3005>	[Jun 24 20:15:23] :/
<pedro3005>	[Jun 24 20:15:31] is there any way to do what I want?
<Snova>	[Jun 24 20:15:54] what did you want?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 24 20:16:12] put these functions somewhere so I can "import" them later
<Snova>	[Jun 24 20:16:27] you would put that code into a .c file, and the function definitions into a .h file
<pedro3005>	[Jun 24 20:17:26] and what exactly is the function definition?
<Snova>	[Jun 24 20:18:04] char* fgetdelim(char delim, FILE* fp);
<Snova>	[Jun 24 20:18:09] char *getdelim(char delim);
<Snova>	[Jun 24 20:18:13] etc.
<pedro3005>	[Jun 24 20:18:30] so I put these things in a .h file
<pedro3005>	[Jun 24 20:18:35] and the code in a .c file
<pedro3005>	[Jun 24 20:18:38] just that?
<Snova>	[Jun 24 20:19:28] yes
<pedro3005>	[Jun 24 20:19:48] don't I need to specify in the .h file where is the .c file?
<Snova>	[Jun 24 20:20:21] no
<Snova>	[Jun 24 20:20:28] because you have to compile and link the .c file yourself
<Snova>	[Jun 24 20:20:41] .h files are just definitions for the sake of the compiler
<pedro3005>	[Jun 24 20:21:05] and what does "link" mean?
<Snova>	[Jun 24 20:21:38] the usual process of combining every library you're actually using into a binary, which I suspect has been transparent to you until now
<bgs100>	[Jun 24 20:22:06] back
<Snova>	[Jun 24 20:22:12] the usual process of building C code consists of compiling each individual .c file into a .o file ("object code") and "linking" all of those .o files, along with necessary libraries, into your finished binary
<Snova>	[Jun 24 20:22:32] putting bgs100's code into a separate .c file essentially gives you your first (I think?) multi-file C program
<bgs100>	[Jun 24 20:22:38] Snova, Yeah, I was going to discuss this in the 3rd party libraries section which never happened
<Snova>	[Jun 24 20:23:02] you *can* compile it all in one go; gcc will let you simply pass it a list of .c files and it will do it all for you without generating intermediate .o files (well... oh, never mind)
<Snova>	[Jun 24 20:23:16] hm, wish seidos was here, else i'll have to explain this twice
<bgs100>	[Jun 24 20:23:20] lol @ never mind :P
<pedro3005>	[Jun 24 20:23:49] well, we can wait for him
<Snova>	[Jun 24 20:24:10] I would have to go through various other compilation phases, /tmp files, and pipelining for that "well..." to make sense :p
<bgs100>	[Jun 24 20:31:48] heh
<pedro3005>	[Jun 24 20:56:28] bgs100, Snova, seidos is here
<bgs100>	[Jun 24 20:56:48] :O
<bgs100>	[Jun 24 20:56:54] seidos, pingeth
<seidos>	[Jun 24 20:56:54] hola
<bgs100>	[Jun 24 20:57:04] seidos, Hi, you've missed a bunch :P
<seidos>	[Jun 24 20:57:23] yeah, I still haven't read the logs from the last class
<seidos>	[Jun 24 20:57:38] I guess just distracted by other problems
<bgs100>	[Jun 24 20:57:51] Ah...
<bgs100>	[Jun 24 20:57:59] well go ahead and read those logs then :P
<seidos>	[Jun 24 20:59:32] oh, I have a question.  can one use scanf to accept string input?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 24 21:02:35] bgs100, +1 to that question
<bgs100>	[Jun 24 21:02:45] Yes.
<bgs100>	[Jun 24 21:02:56] But it only gets up to a whitespace
<bgs100>	[Jun 24 21:04:29] It's the "%s" format.
<bgs100>	[Jun 24 21:04:41] char string[21];
<bgs100>	[Jun 24 21:04:50] scanf("%s", &string);
* duanedesign [Jun 24 21:05:36] waves ay everyone
<bgs100>	[Jun 24 21:05:52] hai
<pedro3005>	[Jun 24 21:06:57] hey duanedesign
<seidos>	[Jun 24 21:07:46] ah %s, never would've guessed that
<seidos>	[Jun 24 21:07:52] thanks bgs100
<bgs100>	[Jun 24 21:11:33] np
<bgs100>	[Jun 24 21:11:38] seidos, s is for string :p
<duanedesign>	[Jun 24 21:15:14] what would be the differences between the integer variables:  int, short, long
<Snova>	[Jun 24 21:18:33] size
<Snova>	[Jun 24 21:18:41] between int and long, possibly nothing
<Snova>	[Jun 24 21:19:06] short is 16 bits and int is 32; long is 32 and /might/ be 64 on 64-bit machines... not sure on that; integer sizes can be unreliably
<Snova>	[Jun 24 21:19:27] unreliable*
<duanedesign>	[Jun 24 21:32:23] in C does the array index start at 0?
<Snova>	[Jun 24 21:32:55] yes
<Snova>	[Jun 24 21:33:09] most languages do, actually; the exceptions are rare and rather odd
* duanedesign [Jun 24 21:33:51] nods
