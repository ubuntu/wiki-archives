==== Notes ====
<pre>
Note 1:  To get sound working:
         Add the following line to /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base
         options snd-hda-intel model=3stack
</pre>
<pre>
Addition to Note 1:  I found that adding the line 
         options snd-hda-intel model=lenovo
         instead of the line in Note 1
         allows for the sound to correctly disable on the main speakers when headphones are plugged in.
</pre>
<pre>
Note 2:  Sound volume seems weak (still very usable though)
         I got nasty looks from others in the library after
         getting it to work; Speakers do not turn off when 
         headphones are plugged in.  I vaguely remember reading 
         something about this in the forums and there is a work-around.
         I will report back when I get it working correctly. 
</pre>
<pre>
Note 3:  USB HD would not eject with a right click on icon
         and left click on eject.  Known bug, forums have a
         work around; USB DVD drive worked perfectly
         USB HD umount working in 7.10!!
</pre>
<pre>
Note 4:  Firewire HD not working
         Firewire DVD works
         Firewire Mini-DV camcorder works
</pre>
<pre>
Note 5:  Beryl works great. (Working in 7.10)
Note 6:  Can't get www.cbs.com to work so I can watch Jericho online
         Working now.  Installed mplayer (don't know how I missed that!)
</pre>
All this for a laptop that cost me only $850.  I have heard of people getting them for less than $800 also.  A pretty good deal for a budget level laptop.  This machine blazes with Ubuntu, but is a slow crawler with Vista.  I haven't tried it with WinXP yet so don't know the speed for that.  WinXP in a VMware player window is faster than Vista installed and booted directly!
