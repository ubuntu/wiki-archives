=== Current Issues ===
This is written based on a quick tryout with the Dapper LiveCD without installing anything.

Live CD for Feisty requires xorg-driver-fglrx to be installed which is not on live cd.  See Feisty Install section below.

==== Notes ====

=== Hardy Install ===

Works extremely well on a clean install...
* Wireless works and the default graphics driver (non-fglrx) gets the correct widescreen resolution.
* Would be more than acceptable to work on a clean install with no tweaks.

* CPU frequency scaling applet(s) recommended!
* Fglrx driver required for desktop effects
Recommended to set gpu powerstate to 1 for best battery and lower heat. It can still cope with compiz in this powerstate...
<pre>
aticonfig --set-powerstate=1
</pre>
* Fprint required for fingerprint reader

=== Feisty Install ===
If installing from the live CD you will need a working network connection.

You need to have the xorg-driver-fglrx installed and you'll need a network connection to do this.

When the live cd boots up use Ctrl-Alt-F1 to get a terminal up.
Then:
<pre>
sudo apt-get install xorg-driver-fglrx
</pre>
Then:
<pre>
sudo aticonfig --initial
</pre>
You should be able to restart x then using either:
<pre>
startx
</pre>
or
<pre>
sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
</pre>
