==== Notes ====
Sound card not automatically detected. Can be fixed afterwards:
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Gutsy_Intel_HD_Audio_Controller

Crystal Eye web cam can be installed via https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EasyCam

Compiz works after installing 'xserver-xgl'. The Intel G965 graphic chip is not fully supported by Gutsy. There are presently problems with 3D applications like Google Earth or games. Feisty did not have theses problems.
