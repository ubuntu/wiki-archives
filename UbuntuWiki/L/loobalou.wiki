Hello,

My name is Loobalou, i am 33yo male from MANCHESTER,ENGLAND. I have only been using Ubuntu for about 1 month so i'm still a finding my way around.I am interested in joining the Ubuntu Beginners Team. It was my strong passion with open source software that has lead my path to where i am now(using a linux OS).It has taken me a good few week to get use to change after using windows for so long.But the journey has be awesome so far.I am hoping to focus my learning towards some kind of programming within Linux.
  
Thanks,Loobalou
