== Installing Ubuntu 5.10 on a Acer Travelmate 4150 laptop ==
Problems on installing Ubuntu 5.10 on a Acer Travelmate 4150 laptop. This problem has been reported on many forums, but until know I did not find any solution. At the site http://scrabbers.blogspot.com/ is presented a solution to install Ubuntu 4.10 on this laptop, however the procedure presented there do not work with Ubuntu 5.10 (did not test it with Ubuntu 4.10 either).

The problem occurs when the Ubuntu 5.10 installer is trying to mount the CD-Rom (immediately after the keyboard selection). It reports that cannot find any CD-Rom available, despite the fact that it boots from it.

I have tried to install from an external CD Rom (connected via USB) and the external CR Rom was well recognized. But then, when the installer tries to mount the hard drive, it fails.

From the previously stated, the problem may reside in the IDE Controller, which cannot recognize either the CD-Rom or the Hard Drive.

Thank you in advance for any help.
