=== System Info ===
* System manufacturer: ASUSTeK Computer Inc.
* System product name: F9SG
* System version: 1.0

=== Current Issues ===
* Problem with Twinview mode deactivating some of the hotkeys (Fn+F9 as for now)
* Don't know how to have the "Power4Gear HotKeys" manage the different powersaving modes (although it's not a laptop issue)
* Wi-Fi LED sometimes doesn't act as expected on Kubuntu.
* Bad english :-)

==== Display switching issue ====
To get the Fn+F8 hotkey working you'll have to use some trick you can find on the internet. Here's the one I used to manage to get it ''almost'' working. First, acpid won't be enough because it doesn't translate the hotkey events into scancodes, then if I try to use ACPI events instead I end up with actions taken as root, which is '''''no good'''''. So I tried with asus_acpid daemon which is a userland daemon in combination with some nvidia-settings utility options to switch to the corresponding mode.<<BR>>The problem is I didn't manage to get all the right utility options so when switching to external display I got a 1280x800 virtual display with a 1360x768 desktop inside of it. That is, while the LCD desktop is still full screen the external desktop has to scroll to get to the borders of the virtual screen. It's kind of weird but I can live with it.<<BR>>Anyway there is no such problem if you use nvidia-settings utility to switch displays and watching HD movies on DFP TV is really enjoying... at least.

==== Missing HotKeys issue ====
See [5]<<BR>>F1, F2, F5, F6, F10, F11, F12 work right out of the box on Kubuntu.

==== Notes ====
 1.#1 Tested with 'installed' Kubuntu 9.04 CD-ROM kernel 2.6.28-15-generic.
 2.#2 Booted and ran 'live' Kubuntu CD-ROM correctly.
 3.#3 Tested with flat panel TV on HDMI output. TV is full HD with resolution 1360x768.
 4.#4 Through nvidia-settings utility.
 5.#5 For hotkeys F3,F4,F8 and F9 one'll have to use the so called asus_acpid daemon which works in userland, because acpid gets the keystroke events but it doesn't send any associated scancodes. So for convenience I'm writing down the ACPI event's codes rather than keycodes.
 6.#6 Fn+F8 uses 3 events as follow:
*************** hotkey ATKD 00000061: switches to external only output
*************** hotkey ATKD 000000A0: switches to external+LCD output
*************** hotkey ATKD 000000A1: switches to LCD only output
      see above for an explanation about the display switching issue.
 7.#7 This hotkey works but I don't know how to change powersaving mode automaticaly i.e without the help of the PowerDevil utility.
 8.#8 I had to configure WI-Fi switch and the associated led activity separately to get the hole thing working the right way, otherwise the led keeps lightening. This hard switch manages both Wi-Fi and bluetooth at the same time:
*************** sends "hotkey ATKD 0000005D"+"hotkey ATKD 0000007D" to activate
*************** sends "hotkey ATKD 0000005F"+"hotkey ATKD 0000007E" to deactivate
 9.#9 This HotKey always sends 2 events so it can manage alternately Wi-Fi and bluetooth.
*************** hotkey ATKD 0000005D is sent to activate/deactivate wifi in conjunction with:
*************** hotkey ATKD 0000007E to stop bluetooth
*************** hotkey ATKD 0000007D to activate it
 It doesn't work very well on my ubuntu.
