__TOC__

=== Introduction ===

This page lists the results of testing Ubuntu Breezy Badger 5.10 on the machine. See <nowiki>[[LaptopTestingTeam-ThinkpadT43-1871|the main page]]</nowiki> for all testing and machine specifications.

=== Current Problems ===

This section will describe the current problems I've had with running Ubuntu Unstable (Breezy Badger) on this laptop. For more information see the individual reports.
* Installer breaks rescue partition Bug <nowiki>[[http://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/show_bug.cgi?id=13390|#13390]]</nowiki>
* Volume Hotkeys do not show on display. It seems that installing tpb should solve this, but it doesn't, probably due to a combination of launchpad bugs <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/malone/bugs/341|#341]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/malone/bugs/446|#446]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/malone/bugs/589/|#589]]</nowiki>
* Hard drive shock protection not working AFAICS
* Fingerprint reader not working
* Wireless hotkey switches both bluetooth and wifi on/off, but does not toggle them individually. bug <nowiki>[[http://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/show_bug.cgi?id=18548|#18548]]</nowiki>
