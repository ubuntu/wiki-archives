=== Current Issues ===

==== Intrepid ====
Much better then Hardy but still some remaining issues.

Touchpad seems to have some sensibility issues. Tap and double tap don't work reliably

Power button doesn't respond to anything

Bluetooth hardware is found but I can't get communication to work with other devices.
Can be helped by "sudo hciconfig hci0 reset"

==== Hardy ====

Bluetooth hardware is found but I can't get communication to work with other devices

For the wireless network the hardware is found but it only works sporadicly. Some Sony power saving feature I'd guess.

WLAN LED doesn't work

Issues with suspend/resume
