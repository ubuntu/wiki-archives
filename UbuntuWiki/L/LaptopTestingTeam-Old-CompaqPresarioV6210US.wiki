== Ubuntu 7.04 "Feisty" on a Compaq Presario V6210US laptop ==

These are the findings on modifications needed to get Ubuntu 7.04 to boot on the Compaq Presario V6210US.

- Add the following to the boot options for the kernel. Not doing so will result in the laptop hanging right as the X server begins to start.
** <code>noapic pnpbios=off</code>

- Install fwcutter to extract firmware from the Broadcom bcm4311 wireless chipset. 

All else seems to work flawlessly
