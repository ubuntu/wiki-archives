=== Current Issues ===
- If suspended (using Gnome's "turn computer off" interface), seems to go in suspension well, but doesn't come back (computer hangs, black screen, ShiftLock/Numlock/... keys don't respond)

- Hibernate doesn't work either (using Gnome)

Both issues with a new system installed (Gutsy 7.10 Beta), out-of-the-box, I need to tweak the system to see if these problems can be solved using well-known fixes for power management bugs.

- The screen brightness can't be changed. The Fn (F5 and F6) keys won't give any response, and using utilities directly from a shell (spicctrl, smartdimmer and such) won't work either. This is a known problem with several Vaio models and <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=3722660&postcount=3|a fix (from nvidia) is in the works]]</nowiki>. You may want to give a try to the latest nvidia drivers to check if it's fixed.

- Webcam will not work without tweaking. To make it work, just install the r5u870 kernel module as explained <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=3342067&postcount=16|in this post]]</nowiki>. After installing (and loading) it the webcam will work like a charm (tested with Ekiga and aMSN). If you have troubles after installing the kernel module try the following:

1) make the /dev/video0 device world writable and readable (chmod 666 /dev/video0)

2) Add "uvcvideo" to /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist, as it might interfere with the r5u870 kernel module.
