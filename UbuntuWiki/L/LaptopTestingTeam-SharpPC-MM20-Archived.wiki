=== Current Issues ===

* X is broken for Breezy Release Candidate. Screen is unreadable at first login.
* I filed a bug for this issue: http://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/show_bug.cgi?id=14940
* Partial workaround: The screen is garbled and you cannot see to switch to another virtual console. Press control-alt-F1 to switch consoles. Type in your username. Press enter. Type in your password. Press enter. Type "shutdown -h now". This will ensure that your install is safely written to disk before restart. Wait for the machine to shut down. Start it up again and choose "rescue mode" in the boot menu. You'll be logged in as root at the (now readable) console. Edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf and comment out the GLCore, dri, and glx modules. "shutdown -r now" to reboot and GDM should work normally. This approach has the downside of disabling 3d acceleration.
