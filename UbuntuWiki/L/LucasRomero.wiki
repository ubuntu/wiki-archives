==== Summary ====

I'm from Buenos Aires, Argentina. I study Multimedial Design and Industrial Design, I have related to many branches of design, giving equal importance to all. I love design and I like to "waste" my time on it :). Back in 2007 I discovered Ubuntu in my school days, I was finding a space and an appreciation for this community. Today I like to do different exercises designed to help the project in any way possible. I like the atmosphere and the decisions that are taken with Ubuntu in general.

=== My Goals ===
* Contribute with more and more design to the Core Apps.
* Contribute to the design (usability) of applications for Ubuntu.
* Collaborate from the design to <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuconla.org/|UbuConLA]]</nowiki> and other projects.
* Contribute from the spread so that more people are encouraged to use Ubuntu.

== Ubuntu community contributions ==

=== Ubuntu App Developer Showdown 2013 (Icon design) ===

When Ubuntu released this event, I have taken the initiative to help participants with the design of icons for a better consistency. Many of these will see the icons when installing applications in Ubuntu Touch.

<nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Touch/AppShowdownList|You can see the icons and projects here]]</nowiki>

=== Ubuntu Touch Concepts (UX, GUI and Icons) ===

During my free time I was able to contribute to Ubuntu in the design area. I have made several designs for some Core Apps and for some community projects.

=== Ubuntu Touch GUI Toolkit ===

Show more an idea is great and encouraging. Do not we all have the programming skills to do so. 
I have therefore contributed to the community with this pack of graphic tools, designed based on the SDK and design guidelines.

=== UbuConLA 2013 - Opening video ===

I created this animated intro for "UbuConLA 2013" (based in Uruguay): <nowiki>[[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPedK7cEQoA|Here the video]]</nowiki>

=== UbuCon Latin America 2012/2013 ===

I am an active member of <nowiki>[[http://graficalibre.org/|Gráfica Libre]]</nowiki>, collaborative design group. We had raised the possibility to take care of the graphics of <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuconla.org/|UbuConLA]]</nowiki> and as a member could perform occasional graphic piece for the event.
The design process is very interesting and has had a significant impact on the local community.
The design began with a proposal that was made ​​to the university, had to make a brand redesign. This course was approved and used in the graph of the event.
While I have provided a lot of my spare time for various graphs, note that it was a collaborative process, and many people were involved, some more, some less. <nowiki>[[http://lucasromerodb.blogspot.com.ar/2013/06/ubuconla-2013.html|But here I detail in what I have worked more.]]</nowiki>
