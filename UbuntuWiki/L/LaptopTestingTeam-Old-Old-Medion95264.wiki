==== Notes ====
 1. Breezy freezes when power cord attached or detached if not in sleep/hibernating. Only power button works and machine needs to be shut down. In Dapper (Flight 6) things work, but hibernating sometimes takes as long as ten minutes! USB-mouse doen't wake on resume and it needs to be detached and attached again.
 2. No sound from the speakers, low volume levels from phone jack
 3. WEP works great. To get WPA working, you need to edit the /etc/network/interfaces and add the following:
* iface ra0 inet dhcp
* pre-up iwconfig ra0 essid your-essid
* pre-up iwconfig ra0 mode managed
* pre-up iwpriv ra0 set Channel=11
* pre-up iwpriv ra0 set AuthMode=WPAPSK
* pre-up iwpriv ra0 set EncrypType=AES
* pre-up iwpriv ra0 set WPAPSK=your-password
* pre-up iwpriv ra0 set TxRate=0
* auto ra0
 4.#4 Number Pad works as numbers with Num Lock on and as Home/End/Pgup/Pgdn with Fn-key. Much like Num Pad on a regular keyboard.
