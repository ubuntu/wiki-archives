PaulSladen: does "No cardreader" mean that the laptop doesn't have one/any.  Or that there is one that isn't working?

MattKirchhoff2: It doesn't have one; certain versions of this model do. It's my understanding that these 6-in-1 readers do *not* work with Breezy, but I can't test this.

=== Current Issues ===

Everything works well... will fill in details as available

==== Notes ====

On some of these laptops, it appears 32bit cardbus devices can't be read. If this problem shows, try adding a boot paramater of '''pci=assign-busses'''.
