<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 19:20:04] I mean, we're actually offering a free course on C, you'd expect more people to show up

<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 19:33:22] I'm in 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 19:33:35] Alright, cool 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 19:33:39] hey bgs100 are you employed? 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 19:34:01] No, not old enough to be.

<bgs100>	[Jun 18 19:34:47] Naw, I'm just 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 19:34:52] 9000!!!!!! 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 19:34:54] (jk)
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 19:34:59] Anyway 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 19:35:05] seidos, Do you have the homework?
<seidos>	[Jun 18 19:35:16] yeah, but I couldn't get it to work right 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 19:35:24] hm
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 19:35:28] Pastebin? 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 19:35:33] an if statement isn't executing and I don't know why 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 19:35:45] all right let me pastebin
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 19:36:28] Okay
<seidos>	[Jun 18 19:38:23] http://paste.ubuntu.com/451829/ 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 19:38:50] bgs100 ^^ 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 19:39:02] Okay 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 19:40:42] seidos, It's because, 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 19:42:23] you're scanf()'ing within the if statement for them getting it wrong, so the other if isn't executed, then the next time it loops, it sees that num1 is the same as secret, so stops, and then the program ends 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 19:42:33] Also, if they get it right the first time, 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 19:42:53] then num1 == secret at the beginning of the first loop, so the body never runs 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 19:43:55] You could fix this by, instead of having and else if saying they won, butting the printf() after the for loop, which means they were successful. 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 19:45:00] And then, you don't need the first if statement because it's asking the same thing as the loop. 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 19:45:20] (you need to keep the body of it, though) 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 19:47:16] seidos ?
<seidos>	[Jun 18 19:47:23] yeah, I'm reading what you wrote 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 19:47:27] I'm also on the phone 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 19:47:40] Ah 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 19:47:55] my friend is a teacher and had a tough day 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 19:48:04] 8th graders 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 19:48:12] at an inner city school 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 19:48:20] Ah... 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 19:48:43] Well, here's the fixed version (also removing the unused variable i): 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 19:48:47] http://paste.ubuntu.com/451833/ 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 19:49:02] Oh crap...

<bgs100>	[Jun 18 20:30:04] Yes 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 20:30:05] I am
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 20:30:12] seidos, ^ 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 20:30:39] pedro3005, Are you here? 
* bgs100 [Jun 18 20:30:53] looks at attendance roll and seating chart 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 20:37:02] bgs100, hi 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 20:37:29] Hai 
* bgs100 [Jun 18 20:37:38] wonders where seidos ran off to 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 20:37:55] hey 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 20:37:57] pedro3005, Alright, well, ready to continue?
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 20:38:01] Yay! 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 20:38:01] sure 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 20:38:03] just watching this video on DNA 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 20:38:05] seidos, Ready?
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 20:38:08] Ah 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 20:38:29] oh man, I need to download your code that fixed my HW 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 20:39:22] http://paste.ubuntu.com/451833/ 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 20:39:47] I'm pretty disappointed, I thought the fix would be easier 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 20:39:51] I really thought I was close 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 20:39:57] seidos, You were 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 20:40:07] In all, 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 20:40:17] you could have fixed it just by moving one line of code 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 20:40:30] by moving a line of code, huh? 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 20:40:54] why did you change it to a while loop? 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 20:41:09] Because i wasn't necessary 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 20:41:19] (the variable i) 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 20:41:25] You didn't do anything with it. 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 20:41:35] #define print printf 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 20:41:36] ?! 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 20:41:48] ahhhh 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 20:41:52] pedro3005, Oh, 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 20:42:02] seidos was getting print mixed up with printf, 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 20:42:03] bgs100 taught me that 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 20:42:21] I put it in just to be..."creative" 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 20:42:31] :P 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 20:42:32] so I told seidos they could do that (as a neat thing, I recommended seidos learns to type printf :p) 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 20:42:37] bgs100, doesn't look like the greatest idea lol 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 20:42:39] s/they/he/ 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 20:42:55] pedro3005, It was something neat I decided to show seidos :p 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 20:43:14] ok 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 20:43:14] ANYWAY
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 20:43:25] seidos, you probably shouldn't use it regularly though 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 20:43:58] pedro3005, I don't think it will really matter. 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 20:45:35] Okay
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 20:45:36] So 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 20:45:45] -----------------------------------------THE STANDARD LIBRARY!------------------------------------------ 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 20:45:49] *angels sing* 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 20:47:02] So 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 20:47:04] Yeah 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 20:47:31] Open up a shiny new text file 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 20:47:38] And I will pastebin the code
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 20:49:02] bgs100, I just saw someone do char** argv, does that work?
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 20:49:11] Yeap
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 20:49:23] Remember, array secretly == pointer 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 20:49:38] so argv[][], *argv[], and **argv are all the same
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 20:50:19] ok
<seidos>	[Jun 18 20:51:03] ...hmmm doesn't really make sense, but I'll trust you
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 20:51:23] It will later, so trust me then too
<seidos>	[Jun 18 20:52:51] ok 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 20:55:09] Okay, here ya go:
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 20:55:38] http://pastebin.com/RP0X57Dd 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 20:55:39] SCRO 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 20:55:45] pedro3005, seidos ^^^ 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 20:57:20] bgs100, why did you import time.h? it's not necessary 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 20:57:32] Yes, it is. 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 20:57:55] well, it compiles and runs without 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 20:58:02] although it bitches
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 20:58:05] Yes 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 20:58:12] it b*tches for a reason. 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 20:58:48] bgs100, well, I understand the code :D 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 20:59:22] pedro3005, Do you understand srand(time(NULL)); ? 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 20:59:28] yeah 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 20:59:32] Okay 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 20:59:34] I kind of understand it 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 20:59:41] time.h is what provides time(NULL) 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 20:59:44] er, time() 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 20:59:54] what does srand(time(NULL)) do? 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 20:59:58] anything? 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:00:04] Yes, one sec 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 21:00:05] it's essential 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 21:00:10] it defines the seed of rand 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 21:00:18] that is, where rand will get its numbers from 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:00:22] Who's the teacher here? :P 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:00:28] pedro3005, Eh, 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:00:34] not 'where' 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 21:00:42] in this case, the seemingly random number is generated from the time the code is being run, I guess 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:00:53] Yes 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:00:57] ANYWAY 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 21:01:05] bgs100, why not 'where'? 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:01:23] pedro3005, Since time.h standard gcc is a nice compiler and will let you get by with not including it, but it's bad practice not to when you're using it's definitions. 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 21:01:37] ok 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:01:41] pedro3005, It just provides a starting number for rand and such to do lots of odd math on
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:01:50] A 'seed' 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 21:01:59] okay
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:04:12] Okay 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:04:13] So
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:04:39] In this source, you'll notice we have included so different files
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:05:10] stdlib.h, and time.h
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:05:21] stdlib.h for the functions rand and srand,
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:05:31] time.h for time() 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:05:48] I just explained what srand does,
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:06:42] rand() returns a not-actually-random number 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:06:57] based (originally) on what srand was given 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:07:23] right, a quasi random number
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:07:47] *nodes* time() is a function that, when passed NULL (Null is actually 0, but it represents some fancy stuff that has to do with pointers), return the number of seconds since this one arbitary date,
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:08:15] *nodes*? 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:08:17] 00:00:00 UTC, January 1, 1970
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:08:22] seidos, 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:08:25] I meant *nods*
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:08:27] sorry :p
* seidos [Jun 18 21:08:46] nods
* bgs100 [Jun 18 21:08:56] nods back 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:09:01] Anyway 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:09:24] So, the number of seconds since 1970 is a number that the user probably isn't exactly counting out. 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:09:33] Ohai Snova 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:09:58] Anyway 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:10:20] ooookay 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:10:44] It's very often used as the random seed. 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:10:54] so it will be quasi random because the user won't be trying to figure out the number of seconds on the clock 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:11:11] or the difference in seconds
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 21:11:17] why do you get the rest of its division by 100? 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 21:11:26] also, can't you set a range to rand()? 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:11:30] No.
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:11:42] C does not have optional arguments. 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 21:11:50] that bastard 
* bgs100 [Jun 18 21:12:07] takes away pedro3005's star "no cursing in class" 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:12:16] seidos, Yeah, that number itself will seem quite random, and then rand() does magic weird math to it, also 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 21:12:16] bgs100, cursing
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 21:12:19] C is okay 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:12:31] anyway 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:12:37] especially since it doesn't do anything
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 21:12:58] bgs100, so it'll come up with virtually anything?
* seidos [Jun 18 21:13:01] laughs at pedro3005 as his words fall away before hitting C
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:13:02] pedro3005, We mod it by 100 so it will be in the range of 0 to 99, inclusive 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:13:05] pedro3005, yeah 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:13:27] modulus?
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:13:38] seidos, Yep 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 21:13:45] bgs100, it'll be definitely in the range? 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:13:52] And then we add 1 to make it within the range of 1 - 100. 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:14:01] I have hard time doing mods in my head 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:14:01] pedro3005, If not, something very serious is wrong.
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:14:15] but then, I have a hard time even doing some pretty basic arithmetic 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 21:14:18] bgs100, that % is the same % as 10 % 3 = 1? 
* bgs100 [Jun 18 21:14:22] gives seidos a free calculator 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:14:34] pedro3005, Yes 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 21:14:41] I don't get why it works 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:14:43] I tried dividing 750,000,000,000 by 150,000,000 today and had to check on my calculator to make sure it was 5000
* bgs100 [Jun 18 21:15:08] shrugs 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:15:19] I would've double-checked too 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:15:25] Anyway 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:15:30] pedro3005, What do you mean? 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 21:15:33] I see that it works 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 21:15:43] but why is it never > 99?
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:16:01] Well hopefully it should be able to be 100, thanks to that +1
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:16:12] it must be the % function
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:16:15] er operator 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 21:16:16] well, you get what I mean 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 21:16:18] >.> 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:16:27] Yeah 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:16:28] Okay 
* bgs100 [Jun 18 21:16:35] switches to, uh, math class mode 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:17:27] brb 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 21:18:59] % is division that results in the remainder, rather than the quotient [Jun 18 21:18:59]
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:19:10] back
<Snova>	[Jun 18 21:19:23] if you moduli by 100 then you can't get a number above 100; such a number would have increased the quotient, no? 
* bgs100 [Jun 18 21:19:40] notices teaching assistance
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:20:06] which one is the quotient?  denominator?
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:20:17] er 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 21:20:42] consider 150/100; quotient would be 1.5 or 1; remainder is 50 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:20:48] hey fractions might help, if it's a whole fraction, there is no remainder 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:21:04] ah dang it, quotient is the result
<Snova>	[Jun 18 21:21:21] i may have my terminology slightly incorrect; the point is % takes the remainder and is a convenient way to keep numbers within a certain range 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:21:52] I need to do some more examples to solidify my understanding of %
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 21:21:55] Oh I see 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:22:04] pedro3005, If you multiply 100 as many times as it will go into n, and then take the difference, it can't be larger than greater than/equal to 100 or 100 would have gone in more times. 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 21:22:14] yeah 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 21:22:19] I understand now 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:22:23] can you give me some more % examples? 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 21:22:23] seidos: 150 / 100 = 1r50; 150 % 100 = 50 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:22:24] Good 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:22:55] Somewhat ironically, I was about to bring up math.h 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:23:12] like 2 % 1 -> 2/1 = 2 so 2 % 1 = 0 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 21:23:30] yep 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:23:54] that's an easy one to understand and remember since there is no remainder 
* bgs100 [Jun 18 21:23:55] prepares to disengage math class mode 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:24:08] I don't tend to think in terms of remainders anymore
* seidos [Jun 18 21:24:19] gets out of the way so he doesn't get hurt 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 21:24:20] modulo arithmetic actually comes up quite a lot; for example- a byte has 8 bits and a range of 0-255 (inclusive); what do you get if you increment a byte containing 255? 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 21:24:56] two bytes? 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:25:05] 16 bits? 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:25:17] :P same diff as pedro3005's answer 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 21:25:25] you wish; it's zero
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:25:42] whoa 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 21:25:46] it's also been described as clock math; where 11 + 3 = 2 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 21:25:55] because it's actually (11 + 3) % 12 = 2 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:25:55] isn't there some overflow buffer or something? 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 21:26:05] no, that's why you have larger numbers 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 21:26:08] er, larger types 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:26:27] so the same is true for an int? 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 21:26:35] a byte is a byte is a byte; the most the cpu will do for you is set a flag informing you that the operation overflowed 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:26:37] seidos, Yes 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:26:47] Get a big enough int and suddenly you have a negative number
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:26:48] if you try to increment an int (what's the limit 65,xxx?), it will evaluate to 0?
<Snova>	[Jun 18 21:26:57] shorts have 16 bits and a limit of ~65000 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 21:27:08] er, unsigned ones 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 21:27:18] unsigned ints (32 bits) are about 4 billion; signed ones half that 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 21:27:41] anyway, are we done with math class yet? :) 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:27:43] whoa, I didn't know that.  never thought of what would happen if you overflowed it. 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 21:27:43] well, I don't know what is unsigned/signed 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:27:54] pedro3005,, 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 21:28:03] pedro3005: sign is a binary state (positive, negative), so signed ints use one bit to represent that
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:28:08] me neither, I assume signed has something to do with data integrity 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:28:17] Signed = One bit is dedicated to representing whether the number is positive or negative or not, 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:28:24] how do you declare a signed int?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 21:28:34] 'int' I guess 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:28:35] seidos, They are signed by default. 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 21:28:35] "int" or "signed int"; they're signed by default until you say "unsigned int" 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:28:39] is it like sint number: 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 21:28:48] bgs100, so an unsigned int is always positive? 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:28:54] pedro3005, Or 0. 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 21:28:58] pedro3005: and guess what happens if you overflow it? 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 21:29:15] it becomes 0? 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 21:29:19] or larger, but yes 
* bgs100 [Jun 18 21:29:25] gives pedro3005 star back 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:29:42] the same thing happens to signed and unsigned variables? 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 21:29:46] conveniently enough (or not), the sign bit is at the "top end" of ints, so if you overflow them you actually turn them negative 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:29:52] if overflowed they evaluate to 0?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 21:30:30] But is overflowing an actual danger we should be on the lookout for? 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:30:39] you mean the sign bit negative, but not the actual value of the int right? 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 21:30:41] 2147483647 is the maximum positive number a signed int can hold; if you increment that by one you get -2147483647 or something 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 21:30:47] pedro3005: only if you're dealing with really big numbers, usually 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:30:57] pedro3005, Probably not. 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:30:59] pedro3005,  it had something to do % math 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 21:32:11] pedro3005: if you're using normal ints you'd have to be dealing with numbers beyond 4 billion and something; if it becomes a problem unsigned 64-bit ints have a range of 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 (eighteen quintillion?) and if you go beyond *that*- there are "bigint" libraries to handle it 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:32:29] Wheeeeeeeee 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:32:41] I couldn't even imagine applications that would use 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 21:32:57] the lesson: don't use small ints (shorts, chars) unless you actually have a reason to, and if you get weird negative numbers you might be overflowing something 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 21:33:02] there is one part of physics which weighs the universe 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 21:33:04] :P
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 21:33:34] bgs100, go on 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:34:14] makes me wonder how many bits it would need to handle a googol 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:34:19] I think that's how it's spelled 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:34:39] Okay 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:34:41] Well 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:35:50] Onto math.h 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:35:56] One sec 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 21:36:03] seidos: 333 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:36:43] Snova, how did you figure it out? 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 21:37:28] seidos: math.log(10**100, 2) in python 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:37:34] Snova, ! 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 21:37:44] On a side note, what are your favorite IDEs/text editors/however you like to program 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:37:53] You're going to make my students want to go to a python class instead! 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 21:38:10] I bet it's like 30 lines of code in 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 21:38:11] C 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 21:38:12] bgs100: what? I don't know the mathematical notation for logarithms of arbitrary bases :) (or C for that matter) 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 21:38:18] god damn it I fail at typing today 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:38:27] pedro3005, Actually, no.
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:38:32] In fact
<Snova>	[Jun 18 21:38:35] pedro3005: C has log(), I just don't know how to get a logarithm for something other than base 10 in C 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:38:39] Great introduction to math.h 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 21:38:55] I'm trying out Netbeans and it just screams "bloated" 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:39:07] Lol 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 21:39:27] pedro3005: just because C is "lower-level" doesn't mean it requires reams of code; I've heard of assembly languages that were more compact than C 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:40:01] I just tried math.log(10**100, 2) in python and it didn't work 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 21:40:21] import math; math.log(10**100, 2) 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:40:22] seidos, import math
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:40:34] crud, I was trying use math for some reason 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:40:38] thanks 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:41:12] man I suck at logs 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 21:41:12] I don't really know what a log is
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:41:25] logarithm; the inverse of exponentiation 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 21:41:26] pedro3005: think of it as the inverse of exponentiation 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 21:41:29] bah! 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:41:35] it's like the log has a base, the base in the number 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:41:40] Snova, :D 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 21:41:44] pedro3005: if x^y = z then log(z, y) = x 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 21:41:46] Snova, bgs100 won this round :p
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:41:48] what's the general form?
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:41:55] yeah, that's it 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:42:03] pedro3005, 5 to the power of 6 = 15625, and 15625 log 5 = 6 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:42:11] log (base) 5 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:42:12] I always forget it after I look at it and figure it out 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:42:21] it's like my brain wasn't designed for logs 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 21:42:23] Alright
<Snova>	[Jun 18 21:42:39] bgs100: is that the notation? seidos's query would be "10^100 log 2" then 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:43:09] I don't get what math.log is doing
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:43:20] is it taking log 2 of 10^100? 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:43:21] must be
<Snova>	[Jun 18 21:43:23] yes 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 21:43:49] you wanted to know how many bits that would take. to find out the numerical range of a given number of bits, take 2^bits 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 21:44:03] so you want to know; 2^bits = 10^100 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 21:44:17] which is a simple application of a logarithm; 10^100 log 2 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:44:17] yeah that's what I was doing, I was stupidly putting 2^x and substituting values of x 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 21:44:36] I've done it; now you know a better way 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:44:47] I didn't even think logarithms were applicable 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:44:59] unfortunately, I don't, I have to spend some time rethinking about logs to relearn them 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 21:45:03] we might not be moving through C very quickly, but at least we're getting some math in :p (some of it is foundational though, especially modulo arithmetic) 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:45:51] hey Snova do you have a job? 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 21:45:55] nope 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:46:05] how old are you? 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 21:46:29] 10 < x < 20 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 21:46:40] and older every second 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 21:46:42] seidos, why do you keep asking that to everyone? 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 21:47:17] pedro3005: it's nice to have some idea of who you're talking to
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:47:24] because I'm 31 and live with my mom :D 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:47:41] it makes me wonder how smart the 31 year old programmers are
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:48:21] if I knew c I'm sure I could find a job somewhere 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 21:48:24] Snova, seems to me like lots of people aren't really comfortable saying their ages / etc 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 21:48:53] pedro3005: true 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:48:57] I think if I had more scruples I'd be embarrassed of my age 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:49:06] but I think I'm too old to care
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 21:49:28] aaaaaand back to C :P I'm almost falling asleep on my chair
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:49:33] #include <stdio.h> 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:49:33] #include <math.h>

<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:49:40] } 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:49:42] ERRR 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:49:44] CRAP 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:49:48] That was supposed to be a pastebin link :| 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:49:58] So ignore all of that 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:50:14] http://pastebin.com/UF0eCknA 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:50:41] pedro3005, seidos SCRO , but add this to your compile command: " -lm" 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 21:51:24] Sine of 42: -0.916522 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 21:51:36] isn't it supposed to be positive? 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:51:55] I don't know much about sines and such :p 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 21:52:00] not according to python 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 21:52:08] also, yes 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 21:52:19] Well, if you draw the circle, the first quadrant has positive sine and cosines 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 21:52:25] since x and y are positives 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 21:52:30] 42 is in the first quadrant 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 21:52:34] hm, that would make sense 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:52:56] Um 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:53:01] Notice the last line 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:53:17] (that's the error I *wanted* you to find) 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:53:26] 2 to the power of 333: 2147483647 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 21:53:31] hehe 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:53:33] 42 is in the first quadrant but -.916 is in the 4th 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:53:39] There's the magic number referenced earlier ;) 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:54:29] Anyway 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:54:39] Maybe I shouldn't have gone into math.h... 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:54:46] :P 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 21:54:46] bgs100, oh yeah, googol 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 21:54:52] why is it wrong? 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:54:59] Ahem,
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 21:55:10] google also says sine of 42 is negative 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 21:55:13] pedro3005: note that number is 2**31 - 1; i.e. it's the maximum of a signed int
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:55:15] <Snova> 2147483647 is the maximum positive number a signed int can hold 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 21:55:31] oh, right
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:56:25] why is it 2^333?
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:56:39] shouldn't it be something to do with 32bit? 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 21:56:47] bgs100 chose 2^333
<Snova>	[Jun 18 21:56:48] in theory you'd get 10^100 with that, a googol 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:56:56] ah 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 21:56:57] it is meant to illustrate integer limits 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:57:03] Yeah 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:57:06] so it didn't overflow
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:57:13] I mean, it stopped at the maximum 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:57:20] Apparently not
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 21:57:49] if I try to change it to unsigned long, it says 2^333 = -1 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 21:57:56] that is the result of an implementation detail in pow()
<Snova>	[Jun 18 21:57:58] "If the result overflows, a range error occurs, and the functions return HUGE_VAL, HUGE_VALF, or HUGE_VALL, respectively, with the mathematically correct sign." 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:58:56] what's pow() 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:58:57] Hm, 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 21:59:00] exponentiation 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 21:59:05] C has no builtin exponentiation operator
<seidos>	[Jun 18 21:59:07] oh, power 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:59:11] seidos, The C standard for function for exponentiation 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:59:34] After changing the "(long)" to "(long long int)", the last line becomes:
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 21:59:35] 2 to the power of 333: 9223372036854775807 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 21:59:38] also, I suspect the reason sin(42) returns such an odd number is that is expects radians 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 22:00:01] if you convert 42 to radians first, you get 0.67
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 22:00:06] oh yeah, maybe it is in radians 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 22:01:01] bgs100, well, math isn't difficult, most of what we need can be solved by a quick google 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:01:09] Yes,
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 22:01:17] no real need to go over it in class 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 22:01:26] I like it
<seidos>	[Jun 18 22:01:33] :( 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 22:01:42] ok sorry seidos :p
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:01:48] but I would think it to be much easier to use a math function in your program than to connect to the net and retrieve and parse a page from Google in your program ;) 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 22:01:51] it's cool, it's the teacher's class
<seidos>	[Jun 18 22:01:59] I just wouldn't go over this math stuff otherwise 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 22:02:05] I mean when do I ever use logs? 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 22:02:14] or even trig functions 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:02:19] seidos, 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 22:02:27] whenever you feel the need to invert a power, and whenever you need to do something fancy with triangles/circles, I guess 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:02:32] You use logs when you want to find how many bits would be needed to represent a google 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:02:39] googol* 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:02:53] Stupid company names :p 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 22:03:06] my point is, outside of this class, I have no problems to work on 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 22:03:10] I recall they named it after "a common misspelling of the word googol" 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:03:30] Now it's a more common misspelling. 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 22:03:34] indeed 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 22:03:44] I almost mispelled it
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:03:57] Changing (long long int) to (long double) changes the final line: 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:03:57] 2 to the power of 333: 1.7498e+100 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 22:04:03] I need to improve my memory 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:04:19] seidos, But you misspelled misspelled instead :p
<seidos>	[Jun 18 22:04:38] bgs100, no I recalled googol was the proper spelling, right? 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:04:42] seidos, no, 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 22:04:46] ah crap 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 22:04:50] lol
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 22:04:53] seidos, you're just so impatient for practicalities 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:05:02] I'm saying instead you misspelled 'misspelled' as 'mispelled' xP 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:05:27] ANYWAY 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:05:30] ON WITH THE C 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 22:05:35] I mean, it's a long way until programming something useful 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 22:05:39] you make no sense, sir
<seidos>	[Jun 18 22:05:44] on with the C
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:05:48] seidos, <seidos> I almost mispelled it 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:05:59] You misspelled the word "misspelled". 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 22:06:06] ohhhhh 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:06:09] Lol.
<seidos>	[Jun 18 22:06:17] didn't even know I was misspelling the word misspelled 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 22:06:24] I should pay more attention to the spell checker 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:06:30] ANYWAY 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:06:32] ON WITH THE C 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 22:06:32] I am too arrogant in my spelling habits 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 22:06:34] sorry
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:06:41] np :p 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 22:06:43] *ability rather 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:06:44] ON WITH THE C 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 22:06:49] go on 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:06:59] ONWARDS, TO STDLIB.H 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 22:07:12] wait! 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 22:07:15] one question 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 22:07:20] how did you change the last line 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:07:20] Everyone put on your war helmets, we- 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:07:22] what 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 22:07:25] for pow 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 22:07:30] to long double?
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:07:34]     printf("2 to the power of 333: %Lg\n", (long double)pow(2, 333)); 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 22:07:56] not Ld? 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:08:00] No 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 22:08:11] oh right 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 22:08:13] okay 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 22:08:14] on with the C 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:08:16] ld is long int, lld is long long int, 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:08:22] and then you need long double 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:08:25] SO YEAH 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:08:29] WITH THE C 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:08:31] ONWARDS 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 22:08:37] I get a warning with that 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:08:42] Everyone put on your war helmets, we're hea- 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:08:44] what 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 22:08:47] and it evaluates to 0 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:08:53] ... 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 22:08:59] heehe 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:08:59] It works fine here, so... 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 22:09:05] ONWARDS 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 22:09:05]  printf("2 to the power of 333: %ld\n", (long double)pow(2, 333)); 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:09:11] Snova, VERILY!!! 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 22:09:13] all right, onwards 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 22:09:17] seidos: ld is long int 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:09:18] seidos, NO 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:09:22] seidos, Lg, not ld 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:09:29]     printf("2 to the power of 333: %Lg\n", (long double)pow(2, 333)); [Jun 18 22:09:29]
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:09:39] ... 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:09:41] onwards? 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 22:09:46] seidos: there's about a million formatters for printf; install manpages-dev and see "man 3 printf" if you want to bore yourself 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 22:09:46] yes please 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 22:09:49] bgs100: hey, this is C 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:09:57] Snova, hm? 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 22:10:01] onwards
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:10:11] ONWARDS, TO STDLIB.H 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 22:10:12] bgs100: this is C, we're just on stdio.h rather than stdlib.h :p 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:10:20] Everyone put on your war helmets, we're heading- 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 22:10:25] and there's about a million things there 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:10:41] interrupted again... xP 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:10:49] Snova, More file processing is later 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 22:10:56] ===== stdlib.h ====== 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:10:58] and such 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 22:11:00] go on 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:11:02] pedro3005, thanks
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:11:05] ONWARDS, TO STDLIB.H 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:11:25] Everyone put on your war helmets, we're heading into m/c/realloc()/free() territory! 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:11:30] :p 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 22:11:35] hope you've explained pointers 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:11:44] Yep 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 22:11:46] if not, prepare for a lot more than you bargained for, because that's never come very easily
<Snova>	[Jun 18 22:11:49] oh good 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:11:58] We're going a bit deeper in this time. 
* seidos [Jun 18 22:12:00] hopes he remembers his explanation
* bgs100 [Jun 18 22:12:10] hopes so too.

<seidos>	[Jun 18 22:12:20] I don't think any amount of body armor is going to help 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 22:12:28] well, free() is when mr. tycoon evicts people... ^_^
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:12:33] Good point... 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:12:36] Snova, LOL. 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 22:13:05] pedro3005, did you get that one? 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:13:06] seidos, Correct, the pointers know you're exact location, inside all of your body armour... 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 22:13:15] seidos, nope... 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 22:13:19] must be a programmer's joke 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 22:13:25] all right, I'm not totally doomed 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:13:33] pshaw, you guys are programmers
* bgs100 [Jun 18 22:13:41] gives you both official badges 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 22:13:45] long story; I didn't expect anyone but bgs100 to get that one :p 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:14:01] wait I was supposed to get it? 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:14:10] (just kidding) 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 22:14:27] and if you ask what the story is I'm going to put on my drill sargeant hat and yell at you 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 22:14:40] onwards to STDLIB.H 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:14:46] okay coo, then

<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:21:12] pedro3005, seidos ^ 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 22:21:48] bgs100, what's a good name for this file? 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:21:56] 9.c ? 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:21:57] :p 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 22:21:59] stdlib sounds good 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:22:14] seidos, malloc would be good too.
<seidos>	[Jun 18 22:22:15] I want to be able to reference them later, when I *know* I forget stuff 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 22:23:04] -lm flag for compiler still?
<Snova>	[Jun 18 22:23:24] no 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 22:23:29] sizeof(int)? 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 22:23:32] -lm links in the math library, which is separate for some stupid reason 
* pedro3005 [Jun 18 22:23:33] dies 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 22:23:36] we're not using it right now 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 22:23:47] pedro3005: it will return 4, if that explains anything 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 22:23:52] it still worked, but I'll recompile 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:23:54] pedro3005, Lol.
<Snova>	[Jun 18 22:23:57] seidos: either way 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:24:02] pedro3005, All shall be explained
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:24:07] Well 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:24:09] Maybe not all
<seidos>	[Jun 18 22:24:26] 0 for starters, then 42
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:24:26] But close enough for now.
<Snova>	[Jun 18 22:24:32] "and that concludes today's lessons; the remaining mysteries I leave as homework"? 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:24:38] Snova, xD 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 22:25:08] bgs100, be sure to assign some homework 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 22:25:16] was it  you that explained structs? 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 22:25:27] I don't remember it very well 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:25:30] I did yesterday.
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:25:35] xd 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 22:25:36] ok go on with malloc 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 22:25:56] me neither 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:25:57] Snova, I imagine a C language teacher coming into a class, writing the classic hello world on the board, and then saying "This concludes the class, your homework is to learn the rest of C." 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:26:20] Okay 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:26:21] So 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:26:36] First, sizeof
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 22:26:52] oh that one is easy
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 22:27:00] it's the size of something 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 22:27:02] :P
<Snova>	[Jun 18 22:27:06] in bytes, to be exact 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:27:14] <look of dissapproval> 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:27:27] I'm going to continue with what I was saying anyway 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 22:27:37] s/ss/s/ 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:27:37] sizeof (in the way we're using it) will tell you the number of bytes in a datatype.
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:27:43] Snova, Yes, i know 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:27:45] I* 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:28:19] sizeof(int) varies depending on the system. 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 22:28:36] officially; you're pretty much going to get 4 anywhere you go
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:28:43] sizeof most stuff varies depending on the system, except for sizeof(char) 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:28:51] Snova, sssh 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:29:06] A char is always one byte. 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:29:08] So yeah 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:29:18] Then, we get to malloc
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:29:30] Does anyone here (BESIDES SNOVA) know what it stands for? 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 22:29:40] m-allocation? 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 22:29:52] master allocation 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 22:29:55] meta allocation 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:29:57] seidos, You have allocation correct, 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 22:29:59] seidos: close, but this isn't string theory 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:30:00] what about the m?
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:30:06] Snova, lol 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 22:30:13] haha 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:30:14] pedro3005, fail and fail 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 22:30:28] mister allocation
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 22:30:30] he is grumpy 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:30:36] Lol. 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:30:37] No. 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 22:30:43] multi? 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:30:47] It stands for... (calls on Snova) 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 22:30:54] MAGGOTS 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:30:57] XD 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 22:31:09] memory 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 22:31:09] memory! 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 22:31:10] :D 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:31:15] Lol. 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 22:31:17] ok I googled it 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:31:22] Man 
* seidos [Jun 18 22:31:24] bangs his head and chants stupid 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:31:27] I was about to give you a star
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:31:35] seidos, pedro googled it :p 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:31:47] At least you didn't cheat
<seidos>	[Jun 18 22:31:50] that's a good idea, I have too many tabs open already 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:31:59] HEY 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:32:01] BAD IDEA 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:32:05] IT'S CHEATING 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:32:12] :p 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:32:14] Okay
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:32:20] So what this does is 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:32:31] clear up 4 bytes of space in your memory. 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 22:32:46] why 4?
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:32:46] And then it gives freaky_pointer the address of the start of these 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 22:32:51] pedro3005: the size of an int 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:32:55] pedro3005, That's how many bytes are in an int
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:32:58] Darn it 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:33:00] Beaten 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 22:33:02] oh cool 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:33:15] pedro3005, Yeah, that's why we have sizeof(int) there. 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 22:33:18] pedro3005: malloc() allocates a certain number of bytes; allocating sizeof(int) means... ? 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 22:33:32] allocating an int 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 22:33:36] malloc(4) 
* bgs100 [Jun 18 22:33:37] claps 
* bgs100 [Jun 18 22:33:44] gives pedro3005 a star 
* bgs100 [Jun 18 22:33:48] gives seidos  a star 
* bgs100 [Jun 18 22:33:54] gives Snova a star 
* bgs100 [Jun 18 22:34:01] gives bgs100 a star 
* bgs100 [Jun 18 22:34:06] gives bgs100 5 stars 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:34:10] Anyway 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 22:34:20] what does the * in *freaky_pointer do? 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:34:20] Now that we are all shiny.
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:34:32] seidos, Gets the value at the address freaky_pointer holds 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 22:34:37] seidos: obtains the value that the pointer is pointing to, in this case an int 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 22:34:45] either that or is used to set it; same idea 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 22:34:55] weird 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:35:07] You said it made sense, yesterday :P
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:35:15] anyway
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:35:17] So 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:35:42] We pretty much just manually (sort of) created a integer 
* bgs100 [Jun 18 22:35:55] creates another example 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 22:37:02] why is malloc needed? 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 22:37:29] it's not, and there's no reason to allocate one int with it 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 22:37:36] usually 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 22:37:43] ever? 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 22:37:59] in which case would malloc be useful? 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 22:38:04] no wonder we need a war helmet 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 22:38:18] larger allocations, and passing memory up the stack
<Snova>	[Jun 18 22:38:24] +without globals
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:38:25] pedro3005, Many cases 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:38:32] we will get to those later
<Snova>	[Jun 18 22:38:35] also, dynamic allocations; most major reason
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:38:36] Here is the example: 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:38:43] Snova, yeah 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:38:53] s/yeah/+1/ 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:39:13] http://pastebin.com/RadyCQLg 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:39:17] SCRO 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:39:24] pedro3005, seidos ^ 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:39:44] Also, might want to open a memory usage monitor 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 22:40:10] I killed it 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:40:17] Good. 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:40:26] seidos ?
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:40:52] ... 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 22:40:59] I took a little while to kill it 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:41:02] Ah 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:41:04] Good
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:41:09] Anyway 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 22:41:20] after killing it, is memory freed?
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:41:28] The point of this was to demonstrate the dangers of m/a/realloc() 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:41:30] seidos, Yes
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:41:46] This is known as a "memory leak" 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 22:42:16] hmmm 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:42:18] It is when something is malloc'ed, but forgotten about later in the program, so it just sits around, hogging up your memory. 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:42:29] (or calloc/realloc'd) 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:42:36] I'll just say alloc'd 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 22:42:48] is it possible for memory leaks to exist in some other way? 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:43:05] Yes, most programs don't have memory sucking loops in them 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:43:18] If a variable is assigned to a malloc, 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:43:24] in a non-main function,
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:43:35] and that memory is not somehow free'd later,
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:43:49] (e.g. the function returned the address and another function free'd it), 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:44:00] it will just be sitting there until the program ends 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:44:45] This was a very extreme example. 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:45:05] Anyway
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:45:25] It's 10:41 here; think you've had enough C/Python/Math lesson for the day? 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 22:45:50] I could probably keep going actually 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:45:55] hmm 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:45:57] pedro3005 ? 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 22:46:27] bgs100, I'm actually craving sleep, but I'm sure you could continue with seidos 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 22:46:39] it's up to you dude 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 22:47:04] seidos: "memory leak" just means allocating something without ever deallocating it 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 22:47:14] by accident, that is
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:47:18] Lol 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:47:25] pedro3005, Okay, bye 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:47:28] Hm
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:47:29] Wait
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:47:31] Homework 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 22:47:45] Snova, when I heard "memory leak" I think of a continues leaking of memory, does it have to be continuous to be a "leak"? 
<Snova>	[Jun 18 22:47:51] seidos: nah 
<pedro3005>	[Jun 18 22:48:02] Night
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:48:08] pedro3005, Wait! 
* bgs100 [Jun 18 22:48:14] has to think of homework 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:48:33] Hm, I know 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:48:37] pedro3005, seidos
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:48:55] I want you to take your program from the previous homework, 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:49:40] and modify it so that you never declare an int; doing it all with int pointers + malloc. 
<seidos>	[Jun 18 22:49:55] Jesus! 
* bgs100 [Jun 18 22:49:58] will have to think of better homework in advance for tommorow :p 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:50:07] seidos, It's not that bad xP 
<bgs100>	[Jun 18 22:50:32] pedro3005, okay? 
* bgs100 [Jun 18 22:50:42] hopes pedro3005 isn't gone yet :p
