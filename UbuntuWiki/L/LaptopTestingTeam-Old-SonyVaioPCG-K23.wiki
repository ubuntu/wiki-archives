==== Notes ====

Works pretty well with Ubuntu 6.06 

Would like support for my inbuilt card reader.

3D Acceleretation is slow about 300+ FPS ,

Uses Graphics by ATI Radeon IGP 345

Was a pain in the *** when i installed the vesa(mesa?) drivers, NOTE: do not install fglrx drivers
you will get a LOT of problems ! (!@#)
