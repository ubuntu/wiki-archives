==== Notes ====

=== Xorg (Changing the resolution to 1280x800 and adding he fglrx driver for 3D Acceleration ===

<pre>
$ sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
</pre>

Replace all of the Section "Screen" section with the following code to get "1280x800" resolution.

<pre>
Section "Screen"
	Identifier	"Default Screen"
	Device		"Generic Video Card"
	Monitor		"Generic Monitor"
	DefaultDepth	24
	SubSection "Display"
		Depth		1
		Modes		"1280x800" "800x600" "640x480"
	EndSubSection
	SubSection "Display"
		Depth		4
		Modes		"1280x800" "800x600" "640x480"
	EndSubSection
	SubSection "Display"
		Depth		8
		Modes		"1280x800" "800x600" "640x480"
	EndSubSection
	SubSection "Display"
		Depth		15
		Modes		"1280x800" "800x600" "640x480"
	EndSubSection
	SubSection "Display"
		Depth		16
		Modes		"1280x800" "800x600" "640x480"
	EndSubSection
	SubSection "Display"
		Depth		24
		Modes		"1280x800" "800x600" "640x480"
	EndSubSection
EndSection</pre>

It also might be a wise idea to install the fglrx drivers so that 3D acceleration may be supported.

<pre>
$ sudo apt-get install xorg-driver-fglrx
</pre>

Next, where it says:

<pre>
Section "Device"
	Identifier	"Generic Video Card"
	Driver		"vesa"
	BusID		"PCI:1:0:0"
EndSection</pre>

replace "vesa" with "fglrx"

Finally add the following code to the end of the document:

<pre>
Section "Extensions"
Option "Composite" "0"
EndSection</pre>

Save the file and close it. You should now be able to change your current resolution from 1024x786 to 1280x800 in "System -> Preferences -> Screen Resolution".

Type ''"glxinfo | grep direct"'' and if you get:

<pre>
direct rendering: Yes
</pre>

Then you have successfully added the fglrx driver.
