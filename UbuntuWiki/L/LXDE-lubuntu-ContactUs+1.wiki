== How to get help with Lubuntu ==
You are here because you did not find what you are looking for on '''<nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/Documentation | Lubuntu Documentation Section]]</nowiki>'''.
It is very important to start from there as you may find the answer that you need without waiting for someone else to provide you with an answer.

Please read <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/support/community | Community support Overview]]</nowiki>  <<BR>>

Lubuntu has many support channels (Forum, Live Chat, Mailing List, etc) each has its unique feature(s) and work differently from the other but at the end, all serve one purpose, that is providing the support to our users.

* If you don't like Forums and prefer a quick answer to your question or a simple fix to your problem, then you may need to use the Live Chat (IRC) Channel.

* If you have a simple question or a problem that does not require a long steps to fix, Ask Ubuntu is a good place to start from.

* Would you like to have a discussion with the developers, members of the team and other Lubuntu Users regarding the development cycle or support for the current release? you need then to look at the mailing list.

* Forums have great popularity and many users prefer to use - See <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lubuntu/CommunicationsTeam/Polls#What_do_you_prefer_to_use_for_Technical_Support.2BAC8-General_Qs | this Poll]]</nowiki>. When you have a problem that require many steps to fix (such as a hardware problem), you need the fine most skilled and experienced users to help, you need a future record or reference that you can go back to and you also want to help the community who may have the same issue as yours, it means you need to go for Ubuntu Forums. 

=== Ubuntu Forums ===

'''<nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/ | Ubuntu Forums]]</nowiki>''' has many sections divided as per the categories and the nature of the content.

* If you are an average/advanced user, you can use <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=327 | Ubuntu General Support]]</nowiki>.

Please remember to use the '''Lubuntu prefix''' when posting, this will ensure a faster response to your thread. <nowiki>[[http://i52.tinypic.com/i2ks2s.jpg|This image]]</nowiki> shows the setting of it. This is very important so please don't forget that.
