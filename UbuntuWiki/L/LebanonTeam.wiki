== Welcome ==

This is the wiki page of the Lebanon Local Community Team. We aim to provide free community support to users of Ubuntu as well as advocating the use of Ubuntu to individuals and organizations. Our main target is universities and schools; helping students to have a better view of Ubuntu and know it better. We keep in touch via our <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-lb| Mailing list]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[LebanonTeam-IRC| IRC channel]]</nowiki>.

== Main Target ==

This group is for anyone in Lebanon who use or aim to use any Ubuntu Flavor. This group is for people of all technical abilities from Beginners to Advanced. Everybody is extremely welcome, advocacy is our aim, spreading Ubuntu everywhere, concentrating on Networking, Administration, and Security without forgetting all Linux development languages, and our message will be to cycle the best of our information anywhere for everybody.

== Join us! ==
