==== Notes ====
The laptop is working without problems, even the webcam is working; installation was absolutely smooth. 
The keys F1-F12 are working as one would expect. 
The function keys (brightness, sound [although it influences just microphone volume - but that can probably be set programmatically]) are working too!
