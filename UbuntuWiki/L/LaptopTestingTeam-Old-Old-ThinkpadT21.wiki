==== Notes ====
Scripts used to initiate sleep or hibernation:

/etc/acpi/sleep.sh

/etc/acpi/hibernate.sh

CPU speed applet used to confirm CPU frequency scaling occured.

* Upon initiating the hibernate script (/etc/acpi/hibernate.sh), the laptop's screen blanks, the backlight turns off, and there is about 15 seconds of hard drive activity. The  laptop never turns off, however. After a forced power cycle, the laptop does a fresh boot.

* * The screen blanks, but the backlight never turns off. 'Option "DPMS"' is set in xorg.conf. In Hoary, "xset dpms force off" also blanks the screen, but the backlight still remains on. For some reason, this same command does not work in Breezy, even though the xset package is loaded. "vbetools dpms off" does succeed in turning the backlight off. I believe this may be an issue with the S3 module.

* ** On older Thinkpads, the ethernet driver for the built-in 3com controller fails to load when ACPI is enabled. This problem affects the following Thinkpad models: A20m, A20p, A21e, A21m, A21p, A30, A30p, A31, A31p, T20, T21, T22, X20, X21, X22, TransNote. The problem is well documented at http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Problem_with_3Com_10/100_Ethernet_card_not_being_recognized -- this page also includes workarounds and a link to a patch to the 2.6.12 kernel that is reported to fix the problem.

* *** The scroll wheel on an external mouse does not work in Breezy, even though it did work in Hoary.
