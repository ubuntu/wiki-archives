__TOC__

* Contact: <nowiki>[[PaulSladen]]</nowiki>
* Make: IBM (aka really an Acer)
* Brand: Think''''''Pad
* Model: R31 2656-6FG
* Website: http://www-307.ibm.com/pc/support/site.wss/document.do?sitestyle=ibm&lndocid=MIGR-40213

=== Current Issues ===

* `i8042.nomux=1` is required on the kernel commandline to '''stop erratic pointer movement''' caused by the buggy embedded/keyboard controller combo, this occurs approximately every 60seconds when using ACPI and the `batt-applet` queries state.  With ACPI disabled, the erratic movement is continous, rendering the machine completely unusable with no way to switch to a virtual-terminal.  <nowiki>[[http://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/show_bug.cgi?id=15335|#15335]]</nowiki>
* '''Interupts are not being routed'''/enabled for the mini-pci wireless card.
** Tested with `pci=routeirq`, `pci=noacpi`, `hostap_pci` and `orinoco_pci` drivers.
* The machine must have '''LCD-stretch turned ''off'' ''' (unstretched) for installation and vga16 boot, otherwise the display can't be read.  This can be done with 'Fn-F8' (not marked on the key) or via the BIOS setup (Press F1).
* '''`ibm_acpi` is not being loaded''' and says ''No such device''.  On the R31, only the Fn-F3 and Fn-F12 combinations do anything.  This should have been fixed in `ibm_acpi 0.10`.   <nowiki>[[http://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/show_bug.cgi?id=15332|#15332]]</nowiki>
* ACPI '''DSDT is buggy'''.

Breezy issues:

* PCMCIA IDE devices don't get mounted because `(none)` shows up as '''`/dev/hde` rather than `/dev/hde1`''' 
* Totem opens on DVD insert but then crashes with ''An error occured: Error invoking "dvdnav_get_next_block": Error reading from DVD.''
* CD-ROM/DVD shows up in ''Computer - File Browser'' as a removable disk-drive (which I guess it kind of is), rather than a CD.  On the desktop, the icon is correct.
* `setserial` is not installed by default. <nowiki>[[http://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/show_bug.cgi?id=15331|#15331]]</nowiki>
* Ctrl-Alt-F1 does not work from X to switch to virtual terminals.
* Icons mounted on the desktop appear on top of each other in the top-left hand corner.  eg. an iPod and an Audio-CD.

==== Notes ====

* This laptop is really an Acer (with IBM Nipple, keyboard, IRDA, docking port, power-supply and removable bay) and as such tends to exhibit similar problems such as interupt-handling,
