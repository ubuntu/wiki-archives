== NOTE ==
This is version 1. Please, see <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StartUbuntu | Version 2]]</nowiki>.

== Welcome ==
Hello and Welcome to the Wiki Page of the Start Ubuntu Project. :D
Thank you for your interest. Your help, support and contribution is highly appreciated.

'''Back to WOW Lubuntu'''
<nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lubuntu/CommunicationsTeam/WOWLubuntu | Click Here]]</nowiki>

== The Project's Motto ==
'''"Don't aim for success if you want it; just do what you love and believe in, and it will come naturally."''' - David Frost

== What ==

Brought to you by <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lubuntu/CommunicationsTeam/WOWLubuntu | WOW Lubuntu]]</nowiki> starting from 8th of April 2013, Start Ubuntu (created by <nowiki>[[amjjawad]]</nowiki>) is a huge project and a massive campaign that is aiming to reach to Microsoft Windows XP Users and offering them a modern, unique, stable, fast, powerful, highly customizable, active and amazing community based system, open-source, free Linux-based system which should replace their very old no longer supported system. Start Ubuntu is simply offering NOT ONLY one "replacement" for Windows XP, '''but 8 options, 8 alternatives, 8 Operating Systems - Please see <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/about/about-ubuntu/derivatives | Ubuntu Family]]</nowiki>.'''

== Why ==

'''Microsoft Windows will stop supporting Windows XP on 8th of April 2014 - for more details, please read <nowiki>[[http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/endofsupport.aspx | this article]]</nowiki>'''.

Microsoft is offering two options to Windows XP Users (Small to Medium Business):

* If your current PC meets the system requirements for Windows 7 or Windows 8, you can buy Windows 7 Professional or Windows 8 Pro from a local retailer or Microsoft Certified Partner. 

* If your PC does not meet system requirements, consider purchasing a new business PC with Windows 8 Pro.

Start Ubuntu Project is simply introducing the <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/about/about-ubuntu/derivatives | Ubuntu Family]]</nowiki> to Windows XP Users. :)

== How ==

No doubt this is a huge project and definitely won't be easy to achieve its goals, it will require lots of efforts, time, energy, strong will, dedication and commitment. However, impossible does not exist in our dictionary and therefore, we can surely achieve our goals and make this yet another successful mission for Ubuntu Family.

This project requires a Master Plan. 

=== Master Plan ===

To make life easier, this project will have different phases :)
In order to make it a successful project, we need to stick to the master plan! 

==== Phase 0 ====
Set a solid plan, set priorities, define our goals, explain what Start Ubuntu is all about, highlight the important points, etc. All this will be done on this page and once this page is fully written and done, Phase 0 will be accomplished successfully.

==== Phase 1 ====
Build a Team. This is not going to be a one-man-job, this is going to be '''a massive community''' job ;)

==== Phase 2 ====
Once recruiting a team is done, this team needs to communicate and discuss all about this project. This shall be done on the mailing list of Lubuntu Communication Team:

 a- Join <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~lubuntu-comms | Lubuntu Communications Team]]</nowiki>.

 b- Start your email with '''[Start Ubuntu]''' tag.
 
 c- If you have accounts on Facebook and/or Google+, please join us on <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lubuntu/CommunicationsTeam/WOWLubuntu#Social_Network | WOW Lubuntu Social Network Pages]]</nowiki>. If necessary, we can also create a new individual page for '''Start Lubuntu Project'''

 d - We can use <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lubuntu/ContactUs#Live_Chat | IRC]]</nowiki> for Live Chat too (<nowiki>[[http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=start-ubuntu | #start-ubuntu]]</nowiki> on <nowiki>[[http://www.freenode.net | Freenode]]</nowiki>).

Communications Channels are very important to make this a successful project.

==== Phase 3 ====

Before we start anything, we must prepare something for the Windows XP Users in order to make life easier for them. Some or most if not all of them may never heard about Linux. Some of them think Linux is only for hackers, programmers and geeks. We need to explain to them what is Linux? we need to explain to them that <nowiki>[[http://linux.oneandoneis2.org/LNW.htm | Linux is not Windows]]</nowiki>. We need lots of efforts here. The most important technique is to be simple, plain and easy. No complications and no geeks stuff. '''Linux for a better easy life''', that is our motto.

For that, we need our own version of some kind of comparison between '''Ubuntu and its variants and Windows XP'''.

<nowiki>[[amjjawad]]</nowiki> will take care of writing that but your contribution is very much welcome :)

One of the secret weapon will be Lubuntu 14.04. As per The Head of Lubuntu Developer, the plan is to make 14.04 an LTS Release. If that will become reality, this is a huge success itself. A great move and push for this project. Why? simply because most for Windows XP Users are running Windows XP on old machines. Chances are slim they are using it on the modern machines which are being solid with Windows 7 and Windows 8 these days. Unless of course they downgraded from Windows 7/Windows 8 to Windows XP. 

Not to worry, with the full set of Ubuntu Family, with 8 systems from Ubuntu to Kubuntu to Xubuntu to Lubuntu and others, Windows XP Users will be dazzled, no doubt about it :D

==== Phase 4 ====

The actual action will start from this Phase. However, we are not yet ready to approach the users directly, there is a pre-step to that. In this Phase, we must approach as many projects, communities, organizations, etc as possible. The more people know about this, the better. Using the Media is very important. Our voices must reach to the whole world. In order to achieve that, we must approach first some communities, etc.

Some of the suggestions was to approach <nowiki>[[http://www.linuxfoundation.org/ | Linux Foundation]]</nowiki>. Of course, there are many more which will be listed here later on :)

Please, feel free to mention here some magazines, projects, communities that could help us to spread the word.

==== Phase 5 ====

After completing the previous four (4) Phases successfully, it is time to reach to Windows XP Users. If Phase 4 made a great success, other parties will play a great role to help us.

==== Phase 6 ====

The Second goal/aim of this project is to make the world a better place with Linux. Enlighten the world with Linux. People need to see the light eventually and these days, I've seen and heard that some companies are converting from Windows to Linux and go full Linux and this is a reality, not from our imagination :)

Having that said, and since Ubuntu and other family members (Lubuntu, Xubuntu, Kubuntu, etc) aress Linux Distributions, our mission might not be limited to spread the word of Ubuntu, but also Linux in general ;)

So, in summary:
Phase A = Start Ubuntu
Phase B = Start Linux 

==== Phase 7 ====

To be discussed later

== Start Ubuntu Members ==

Members of this project will be named: '''Start Ubuntu Ambassadors - SUA''' :D
