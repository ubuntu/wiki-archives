* Contact: MatteoCollina
* Brand: Asus
* Make : ASUSTek Computer Inc.
* Model: A8Js

* S/N: not a canonical laptop

=== Current Issues ===

* Sound:
** The volume applet doesn't change the volume of the headphone. It's necessary to use alsamixer and modify the "headphone" volume. This happens because there isn't a "master" volume in alsamixer, only "front" and "headphone". The applet  (and alsamixer) changes only "front". The solution to this problem is to configure gnome to change the "front" and "headphone" volumes at the same time. This can be done selecting "headphone" and "front" under "Default Mixer Tracks" in Sound Preferences (System -> Preferences -> Sound).

* Function and other keys issues:
** The Bluetooth led doesn't work when switching the device on/off through the keys <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/acpi-support/+bug/105924|105924]]</nowiki>. There isn't a file under /proc/acpi/asus/ to switch on/off the bluetooth led <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.20/+bug/105935|105935]]</nowiki>.
** The Fn+F2 key doesn't swicth off the wifi device <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/acpi-support/+bug/105929|105929]]</nowiki>.

* Power Managment:
** Hibernates works with the nvidia-glx-new driver following this guide: NvidiaLaptopBinaryDriverSuspend.

* This laptop model isn't currently supported by the module "asus-acpi" <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.20/+bug/105935|105935]]</nowiki>, and this is the reason for the bluetooth issue.
