=== Current Issues ===
The boot up may hang on error "soft lock up CPU#0", which is probably related to the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.17/+bug/63418|wlan-card not being activated correctly]]</nowiki>. This error however seems to go away by itself, or at least occur only randomly.

When you come past this issue, you'll end up with a blank screen and a frozen machine, apparently due to graphics card issues. To boot, use parameter vga=771. Later, when Ubuntu is installed on your system, installing nvidia-glx and running nvidia-xconfigure (after reboot) will fix this issue. After running nvidia-configure, check xorg.conf to make your <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/nvidia-xconfig/+bug/74938|keyboard settings correct]]</nowiki> (nvidia-configure activates en_US-keyboard and Alt Gr swapping).
