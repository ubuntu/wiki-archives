<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 18:37:40] juju2143, what's wrong with Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine()); ?
<Snova>	[Jun 23 18:39:47] what *is* wrong with it?
<Snova>	[Jun 23 18:40:01] looks fine to me, and I'm only loosely familiar with c#
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 18:40:13] code goes on to infinite loop
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 18:41:51] I separated it and now it's saying
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 18:41:55] /home/pedro/Projects/TestProgram/TestProgram/Main.cs(16,33): error CS0029: Cannot implicitly convert type `string' to `int'
<Snova>	[Jun 23 18:42:09] what is line 16?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 18:42:58] guess = Console.ReadLine();
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 18:43:04] guess = Convert.ToInt32(guess);
<Snova>	[Jun 23 18:43:06] and what is "guess"?
<Snova>	[Jun 23 18:43:08] ...
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 18:43:15] int guess;
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 18:43:19] shit lol
<Snova>	[Jun 23 18:43:27] glad to see I didn't have to explain that
<Snova>	[Jun 23 18:43:30] afk
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 18:43:54] turning it into string guess only made it worse
<juju2143>	[Jun 23 18:49:27] yeah
<juju2143>	[Jun 23 18:49:49] you are trying to put a int in a string variable
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 18:50:31] what's the solution?
<Snova>	[Jun 23 18:55:40] uh, combine the expressions or use an extra variable
<Snova>	[Jun 23 18:56:02] it's the same static typing as C
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 18:58:18] Snova, http://paste.pocoo.org/show/229171/
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 18:58:28] this code goes on an infinite loop of "too low"
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 18:58:33] never asks for input
<Snova>	[Jun 23 18:59:33] works for me
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 18:59:45] how did you compile it?
<Snova>	[Jun 23 18:59:49] "gmcs test.cs"
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:00:50] yeah
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:00:52] works here too
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:01:02] conclusion:
<Snova>	[Jun 23 19:01:04] a recompilation works wonders sometimes
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:01:07] monodevelop SUCKSSSSSSSSSSSSs
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:01:10] :x
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:05:00] hey bgs100
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:07:08] Hi
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:07:09] sec
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:09:08] Aw crap
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:09:14] Did I miss the C# class?
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:09:29] :[
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:09:49] yes
* bgs100 [Jun 23 19:10:57] will look at logs later
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:11:18] Is the previous class over?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:11:38] it is
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:13:20] Alriiiiighty then
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:13:36] Where's sedios?
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:13:45] ...
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:13:58] Missed another class and half of my students are missing :P
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:14:32] oh well.
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:14:35] *ahem*
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:14:41] half of your students = 1
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:14:44] :p
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:14:49] ...
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:14:53] That was the joke xP
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:14:58] Anyway
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:15:03] I know, I ruined it
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:15:46] sh: Syntax error: Unterminated quoted string
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:15:49] Err
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:15:52] Ignore that :|
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:16:07] ‐=‐=‐=‐=‐=‐=‐=‐=‐=‐=‐=‐=‐=‐=‐= ΜАΥ ТΗЕ ʗ ⅭⅬАՏՏ ВЕԌІΝ! =‐=‐=‐=‐=‐=‐=‐=‐=‐=‐=‐=‐=‐=‐=‐
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:16:29] (super unicode powers go! :P)
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:16:51] ʗ is an awesome C.
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:16:55] Okay
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:16:59] okay
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:17:08] I am like totally confused
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:17:10] pedro3005, So what have you been doing with ʗ ?
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:17:26] ...okay
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:17:32] bgs100, I'm completely lost on input issues :x
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:17:37] :[
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:17:59] one sec
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:18:07] pedro3005, How are you lost?
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:18:44] ...
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:18:58] well
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:19:06] I'm so lost I don't even know how am I lost
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:19:07] :P
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:19:17] :|
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:19:39] Okay
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:19:54] but for instance
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:20:03] on the problem 2 of beginners challenges
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:20:17] okay, I used fgets to grab the forum name
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:20:28] Okay...
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:20:29] should I use that for age too?
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:20:50] Sure
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:21:06] Then it's a matter of dealing with a string, not one of input
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:21:15] but I want age as an int
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:21:18] mhm
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:21:26] So...
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:21:50] Get the input, make sure all the characters are numbers, then convert it to an int.
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:22:44] pedro3005, Okay?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:22:48] I'll try
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:23:02] Okay, would youl ike help with those steps?
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:23:15] you like*
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:23:24] pedro3005, Also
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:23:32] pedro3005, Look up the atoi function
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:23:43] That will help you with the last step
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:24:01] bgs100, is there something like lambda in C?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:24:19] eh probably not
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:24:29] i'll have to make a function for it
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:24:45] but this function thing is silly
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:24:52] pedro3005, Nope, no lambda
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:24:56] why make a function if I'm only gonna use it once?
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:24:56] pedro3005, Hm?
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:25:00] Uh
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:25:04] You don't have to.
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:25:08] Well
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:25:10] Wait
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:25:13] ok
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:25:16] pedro3005, What are you trying to do?
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:25:25] or
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:25:27] check if an entire array is a digit
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:25:28] rather
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:25:29] How?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:25:46] iterate through each element checking isdigit()
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:25:51] pedro3005, Well, you do have to make a function if you're just going to use it once.
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:25:56] pedro3005, Good
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:25:58] Er
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:26:01] s/do/don't/
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:26:02] Fail
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:26:11] You can if you want *shrugs*
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:26:47] I don't see why lambda would do much for you here...
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:27:51] bgs100, isdigit() returns 1 if it is a digit?
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:29:48] mhm
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:29:54] pedro3005, ^
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:30:44] ...
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:30:50] well
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:30:56] this sucks
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:31:03] .....
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:31:06] What?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:31:23] how will I check if the array is a digit?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:31:25] for instance
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:31:30] age can be up to 3 digits
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:31:39] but if it's 2
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:31:46] and the third won't be
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:31:51] Something like:
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:32:01] so I gotta check that all chars present must be a digit
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:32:08] int alldigits = 1;
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:32:12] int i;
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:32:33] for (i = 0; age[i] != '\0'; i++) {
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:32:48]     if (!isdigit(a[i]))
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:33:07] er
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:33:16] for (i = 0; age[i] != '\0' && alldigits; i++) {
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:33:19]     if (!isdigit(a[i]))
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:33:24]         alldigits = 0;
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:33:25] }
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:33:40] And then if alldigits is one at the end you know it's good
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:33:45] Or, all digits :P
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:33:57] pedro3005, Get it>
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:33:57] yeah but I wanted to do this in a while statement :P
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:33:59] pedro3005, Get it?*
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:34:23] Hmmmm
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:34:37] of the sort Do-While
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:34:46] *shrugs*
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:34:53] brb
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:35:26] if I input something larger than what fgets() is to take, does it store them somewhere so it can take them the next time?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:35:34] 'cause I think it's doing that
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:36:36] eh, I'll just put this in a function
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:36:41] screw logic
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:40:05] back
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:40:41] pedro3005, Those extra characters are never ead from input,
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:40:46] read*
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:40:55] So they are still on stdin
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:41:07] So next time you read from stdin, yes, you will get those to start
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:41:10] pedro3005, Okay?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:41:18] bgs100, can I 'clear' stdin?
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:41:29] From your purposes, "yes",
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:41:43] Just call getchar() without sacing the results anywhere
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:41:48] Like so:
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:42:00] while (getchar() != '\n');
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:42:04] Thar ya go
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:42:15] ok
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:42:16] Do you get why that works?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:42:19] yeah
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:42:23] Good :)
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:42:27] Now explain it to me :P
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:42:41] it will run getchar until it finds a line break
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:42:50] i.e. a new input
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:43:13] now, I made this function but it doesn't seem to work
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:43:16] int isDigitArray(char *array) {
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:43:16] 	int i;
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:43:16] 	for (i=0; array[i] != '\0'; i++)
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:43:16] 		if (!(isdigit(array[i])))
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:43:16] 			return 0;
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:43:16] 	return 1;
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:43:20] }
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:43:57] It looks okay...
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:44:31] pedro3005, What about the rest of your code, and are you getting any warnings?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:45:00] no warnings
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:45:02] let me paste it
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:45:51] bgs100, http://paste.pocoo.org/show/229185/
* bgs100 [Jun 23 19:46:40] clicks
* pedro3005 [Jun 23 19:46:49] breathes
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:47:09] :p
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:47:20] Btw
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:47:41] You should probably set the first element of name to '\0' or ' '
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:48:12] the _first_?
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:48:24] Isn't that what you're checking in the while?
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:48:36] Err
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:48:37] Duh
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:48:46] Nevermind, I forgot it was a do-while xP
* bgs100 [Jun 23 19:48:56] apologizes to pedro3005 
* pedro3005 [Jun 23 19:49:05] accepts apologies
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:49:23] Um
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:49:42] pedro3005, Should you be doing the do while it ISN'T DigitArray?
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:49:52] e.g. change:
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:49:53] 	} while (isDigitArray(age));
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:49:55] to:
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:49:58] 	} while (!isDigitArray(age));
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:50:01] ... maybe
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:50:02] :P
* bgs100 [Jun 23 19:50:05] facepalms
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:51:04] oh good
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:51:16] I see you're putting spaces between parameters now
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:51:39] wait
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:51:46] I accidentally typed getchar as getcar()
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:51:49] and it compiled
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:51:52] ...
<Snova>	[Jun 23 19:51:56] hm
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:52:01] lolwut
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:52:04] with only a warning
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:52:12] pedro3005, what warning?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:52:18] implicit use of getcar blabla
<Snova>	[Jun 23 19:52:28] I'd be somewhat surprised if it ran though
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:52:34] Snova, I'm wondering if someone added a bit of a Lisp implementation to GCC? :P
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:52:38] what does getcar() do?
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:52:43] #include <cons.h>
<Snova>	[Jun 23 19:52:43] pedro3005: run it and find out?
<Snova>	[Jun 23 19:52:53] I've never heard of it
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:52:59] pedro3005, I dunno (*uses man pages*)
<Snova>	[Jun 23 19:53:05] it's not in them
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:53:11] Indeed
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:53:16] ah when I click *build* it fails
<Snova>	[Jun 23 19:53:27] "test.c:(.text+0x7): undefined reference to `getcar'" as expected
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:53:44] but when I click *compile* it only gave a warning
* bgs100 [Jun 23 19:53:50] whacks pedro3005 "NO FANCY IDEs (besides Emacs if you consider it one) ALLOWS HERE!"
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:53:55] Just kidding :P
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:54:02] :P
<Snova>	[Jun 23 19:54:05] well yes, that's how C compilation works. ain't that nice?
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:54:06] ALLOWED*
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:54:16] yeah
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:54:24] ...
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:54:29] What IDE is it anyway? :p
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:54:36] geany
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:54:40] Oh
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:54:43] That's okay then
* bgs100 [Jun 23 19:54:51] un-yells at pedro3005 
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:54:57] :p
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:55:07] bgs100, anyway, I put while(getchar() != '\n') inside the do{} and now it requires you to hit enter twice
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:55:21] Errrr
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:55:43] This means that fgets got to '\n' :P
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:56:06] ...well?
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:56:18] sec, typing
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:56:37] pedro3005, Check if the last character (besides '\0', ofc) of your input is '\n'.
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:56:45] And if not then do that while.
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:57:45] bgs100, how do I do that?
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:58:13] pedro3005, strlen()
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:58:29] cool
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:58:36] :)
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 19:58:50] does that include '\0'?
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:58:55] No
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 19:59:09] If there is only a '\0', strlen() returns 0
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 20:00:18] so like this?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 20:00:20] if (name[strlen(name)+1] != '\n')
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 20:00:20] 			while (getchar() != '\n');
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:00:31] +1 ?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 20:00:44] hm
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:00:51] I think you want -1, and you'll also want to make sure the length isn't 0 first
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 20:02:02] gahhh
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:02:06] ...
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:02:08] wat
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 20:02:14] so much work
* bgs100 [Jun 23 20:02:21] rolls eyes
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:02:54] pedro3005,
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:03:07] You can just make sure the first character isn't '\0' again :P
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:03:14] *shrugs*
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 20:03:51] if (strlen(name) > 0 && name[strlen(name)-1] != '\n')
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 20:03:52] 			while (getchar() != '\n');
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:04:11] Err
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:04:16] Why get the strlen twice?
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:04:21] That *is* extra work.
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 20:04:23] it works! shush!
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 20:04:25] :P
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:04:33] Just do either:
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:04:45] Assign the length to a variable, and say:
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:05:03] if (length && name[length-1] != '\n')
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:05:05] Or
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:05:12] Just do:
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:05:23] if (name[0] && name[strlen(name)-1] != '\n')
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:05:30] *shrugs*
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:06:21] If name[0] is '\0', which is equal to 0, which represents false in C, it won't run
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:06:29] The if body, that is
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:06:34] anyway
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 20:07:18] bgs100, it won't accept a valid age though
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:07:26] ...
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:07:40] What is your code?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 20:07:49] it only accepts ages with three digits
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 20:07:52] i'll paste
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:07:56] Oh duh
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:07:58] pedro3005,
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:08:02] I know why
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:08:40] It's because you have a newline at the end when you have less than the chars
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:08:44] three*
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 20:09:05] so... what do I do? :p
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:09:18] pedro3005, So, in that same if, replace the newline at the end with '\0'
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:09:50] You'll probably want to be assigning the length to a var at this point :P
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 20:11:32] bgs100, the 'end' is len-1, right?
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:12:01] mhm
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 20:12:43] but we're checking if it _doesn't_ have a newline at the end
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:13:50] Oh yeah
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:13:53] Oop
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:14:27] pedro3005, Well, put it in an else if that checks if the line still isn't empty :P
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:14:29] Or maybe
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:14:41] Just check if thel ine is empty before all that and if so continue
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:14:44] Then just say:
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:14:55] if (name[length-1] != '\n')
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:14:58]     blah
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:15:00] else
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:15:09]     cutoffnewlineblah
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 20:15:11] line empty -> name[0] == '\0'?
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:15:29] Yes, or just !name[0]
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:16:32] pedro3005, Ping me when you have questions, k?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 20:16:45] ok
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 20:27:07] bgs100, I think I did it
* pedro3005 [Jun 23 20:27:24] celebrates
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:27:37] yaaay
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 20:28:20] now on to the last input
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 20:29:09] bgs100, can I do this in C:
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 20:29:13] 4 < x < 10
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:31:42] No.
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:32:15] You can do 4 < x && x < 10 :P
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 20:32:25] :(
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 20:34:27] bgs100, I don't exactly understand atoi() from na
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 20:34:29] man*
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 20:34:49] atoi(x, y, z); what do y and z mean?
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:36:11] Uhhh
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:36:13] It says:
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:36:14] int atoi(const char *nptr);
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 20:36:39] oh oh
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:41:38] :P
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 20:47:38] bgs100, ok, working code
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 20:47:39] whew
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 20:50:08] bgs100, http://paste.pocoo.org/show/229201/
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:53:13] okay
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:53:16] *looks at code*
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:54:32] pedro3005,
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:54:44] although you might want to keep it for code clarity, you can replace:
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:54:45] array[i] != '\0'
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:54:49] with array[i]
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:54:56] in isDigitArray
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:55:18] pedro3005, errr
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:55:43] pedro3005, Tiny problem
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:55:51]         else
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:55:52]             name[nlen-1] = '\0';
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:56:00] That will run if name is empty.
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:56:25] So...
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:56:31] you'll be setting name[-1] to 0
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:56:36] not good
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:56:57] Also
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 20:57:18] it.. works :/
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:57:31] Your code won't exit if it receives "quit"
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:57:53] pedro3005, It might work, but you SHOULD NOT be doing that
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 20:57:57] bgs100, can you see why ID only accepts 6 digit inputs?
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:58:00] You are out of bounds
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:58:20] pedro3005, Because fgets only gets n-1 characters, not n?
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:58:27] And your call says 7, not 8?
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:58:37] And id is 7 elements long, not 8? :P
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 20:58:48] In other words, yes
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 21:00:30] huh?
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 21:00:43] ...
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 21:00:57]     char id[7];
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 21:00:57]     do {
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 21:00:58]         puts("Enter your forum ID:");
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 21:00:58]         fgets(id, 7, stdin);
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 21:00:58]     } while (!isDigitArray(id));
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 21:01:06] gets will get 7-1 characters
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 21:01:09] fgets*
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 21:01:13] 7-1 = 6
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 21:01:18] Thus 6.
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 21:01:43] You will also need to increase id's size by 1.
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 21:01:46] pedro3005, Okay?
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 21:01:55] brb
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 21:07:32] bgs100, forum user id (a postive integer equal to or between 1 and 999999)
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 21:07:36] that's 6
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 21:18:06] hm?
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 21:18:21] What?
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 21:18:33] pedro3005, Was there actually a problem?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 21:18:46] bgs100, you were saying it's 7
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 21:20:50] uhh
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 21:20:56] I'm saying your parameter is 7
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 21:21:16] Because you said "can you see why ID only accepts 6 digit inputs?"
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 21:22:24] bgs100, I fixed that
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 21:22:26] :)
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 21:22:47] bgs100, lol, my C code is actually smaller than some python submissions
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 21:22:49] like... wtf.
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 21:23:12] Lol
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 21:23:21] Those are Python beginners 8rolls eyes*
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 21:23:25] 8rolls eyes**
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 21:23:29] *rolls eyes***
* bgs100 [Jun 23 21:23:44] rips off shift key, replaces with working shift key
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 21:24:57] bgs100, beginners? they used classes
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 21:25:14] And?
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 21:25:26] That's part of python.
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 21:25:32] They could've just learned python.
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 21:25:33] not really beginner stuff
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 21:25:42] Or already been familiar with OOP.
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 21:26:03] I think it's overkill
<Snova>	[Jun 23 21:26:15] and it takes a better programmer to recognize that
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 21:26:37] Yes, it is a "Beginners' Challenge"
* pedro3005 [Jun 23 21:28:30] looks at challenge 3
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 21:31:58] bgs100, my C book doesn't seem to be using things like FILE and fprintf to deal with files
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 21:32:16] instead, some cryptic read() and write() funcions with buffers and what not
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 21:32:35] mmm
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 21:32:41] Odd
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 21:32:59] pedro3005, I have the non-translated version and there's a part where it does indeed you FILEs and fopen
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 21:33:13] bgs100, which?
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 21:33:24] pedro3005, Type man 2 read and man 2 write :P
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 21:33:27] pedro3005, K&R
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 21:33:35] hm?
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 21:35:08] The C Programming Language
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 21:35:22] K&R = Kerninghan and Ritchie, the authors
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 21:35:28] bgs100, I know, but which part?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 21:35:30] I have that book
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 21:35:34] pedro3005, Remember the wikipedia page I showed you? :P
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 21:35:44] no
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 21:35:45] Um
<Snova>	[Jun 23 21:36:34] read()/write() are the "real" i/o functions
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 21:36:35] pedro3005, You're looking in chapter 8 aren't you?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 21:36:39] yes
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 21:37:11] Look in chapter 7
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 21:37:31] Uses that kind of stuff often
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 21:37:42] (that is, fopen and friends)
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 21:41:12] bgs100, so I need to getc until I find \n?
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 21:41:21] ...?
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 21:41:25] For what?!
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 21:42:04] read each line?
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 21:43:13] hm?
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 21:43:27] bgs100, http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=884394

<bgs100>	[Jun 23 21:44:27] oh
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 21:44:45] pedro3005, Well, you could just keep doing what you have been, with fgets...
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 21:44:59] That's basically what fgets does.
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 21:45:19] Puts characters into your array until it's hit the limit you give or '\n'
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 21:45:32] sounds cool
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 21:46:09] bgs100, I'll just need to make a big array then and hope it doesn't get exceeded?
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 21:46:28] Well, it won't get exceeded, because of the limit you give fgets
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 21:47:09] yeah
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 21:47:21] but this fixed size thing is really getting on my nervers

<bgs100>	[Jun 23 21:48:26] Which I gave you the code to yesterday
<pedro3005>	[Jun 23 21:50:33] :P you still need to explain it

<bgs100>	[Jun 23 22:00:09] pedro3005, CHUNKSIZE = 20. It mallocs a space of 20 bytes (which is the size of a char) and then keeps reading in characters and expanding the space when necessary until there is an EOF or a certain delimiter is met.
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 22:00:23] Er
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 22:00:44] I meant to say "It mallocs a space of CHUNKSIZE bytes"
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 22:00:48] but either way
<bgs100>	[Jun 23 22:00:52] *shrugs*
