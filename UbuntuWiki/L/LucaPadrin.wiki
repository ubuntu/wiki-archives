I'm a fan of Free Software, which I'm adopting for years for private and professional use. I think this software can improve also society, because it allows each of us to express our own freedom in using an everyday life's tool like a computer.<<BR>>
For this reason I'm seeking to contribute to more diffusion of Free Software getting involved in translation projects.

A last important thing: ENJOY YOURSELF!<<BR>>
