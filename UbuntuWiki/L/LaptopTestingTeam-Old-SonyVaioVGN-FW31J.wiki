==== Notes ====

1) There is one issue with the headphone jack. After a fresh install the sound works just fine, but plugging in a headphone won't turn off the pc speakers. This, however, can easily be fixed. Add:

options snd-hda-intel model=sony-assamd

to your /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base file. Restart alsa with:

sudo alsa force-reload 

After this all will be fine.

2) For brightness control check out the following blog:

http://vaioubuntu.wordpress.com/2008/12/04/finally-a-brightness-how-to-for-vaio-fw-series/

and follow the instructions for the vaio fw3xx and fw3x series. Good luck!
