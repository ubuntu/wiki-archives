==== Notes ====

There a not a lof of differences between Ubuntu and Kubuntu, but wanted to make sure this got updated.

Updates have solved some of my frustrations with the function keys so good job on getting things fixed whatever was wrong.  Would love to get the K-Menu mapped to my windows key.  Need to spend some more time solving the problems I am currently having.

NOTE: The volume Fn Keys do not work when something is connected to the headphone jack, mentioned this to the laptop-testing team and we are working on figuring it out.

No further differences between Dapper Beta 2 and the release.  However I know longer have access to this laptop to continue testing
