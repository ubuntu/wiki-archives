* ''The Play/Stop/Next/Back are the standard codes so should work.  Which application have you tried to use them with?  eg. Totem'' -PaulSladen
* If I navigate to keyboard shortcuts from System->Preferences I notice that in the sound section play, pause, stop, skip are all marked 'disabled'. These buttons are therefore effectively disabled throughout Gnome unless the user specifically sets them. I can confirm that in Totem and Rhythembox these buttons have no effect when pressed. -PhilWorrall

* ''Please file a bug report regarding the sleep problem.'' -PaulSladen
* Done, see <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/acpi-support/+bug/34750|#34750]]</nowiki>. -PhilWorrall
