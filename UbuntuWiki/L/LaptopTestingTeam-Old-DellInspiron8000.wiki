==== Notes ====

Note that the Inspiron 8000 is really marginal to use as an "Ubuntu" laptop due to it's older (and underpowered) hardware. While it's functional with Gnome, it will be much happier as a Xubuntu system.

N/A = hardware not physically in this system.
Untested = In this system, but unlikely to be tested any time soon.
? = something just not tested yet (11/30/2008)

[1] Initial graphical install has incorrect resolution/refresh, vertical banding & "striped" video. Safe video works properly for install. Initial login worked correctly.

[2] Initially defaulted to 800x600. ATI Mobility M4 video only functions with VESA driver and changing PnP monitor to Dell panel; trying to use ATI or r128 driver either scrambles video or locks system.

[3] PCMCIA wireless card tested was Motorola WN825G, using Broadcom 4306 restricted driver.

[4] Intrepid upgrade issues: On reboot, grub hangs, dumps to initramfs prompt due to UUID error. Reboot to 8.10 kernel recovery mode won't load X and won't fix, load saved default or detect. Reboot to 8.04 kernel works to load system, no network. Edit /boot/menu/grub.lst and replace all "UUID=<uuid>" with "/dev/sda1" (YMMV) fixes problem with reboot, loads X, loads network.

[5] Hey - it's an old laptop. Things like 3D acceleration aren't high on my list of things to do with it.

[6] At some point in Intrepid, the docking station NIC quit working. 'Update-Manager' to Jaunty did not resolve this. No troubleshooting done at this point.
