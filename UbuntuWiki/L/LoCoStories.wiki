== Introduction ==

The purpose of this page is for planning and writing bi-weekly Lo``Co stories to be published on the Fridge. Lo``Co stories should highlight the good work our Lo``Cos are doing. The story can be any one of a number of things, but we should really focus on achievements, such as:
* Events, parties and suchlike.
* Good work going on with packaging, translations and more.
* Local successes such as roll-outs, installations, charity work etc.

== Gathering stories ==

The Lo``Co community will need to be reached out to get content for the stories. 

Plan of action:

* Set up a recurring calendar appointment to solicit and gather content:
** Ask around
** Post to loco-contacts
** Ask in #ubuntu-locoteams
** Put a link at the bottom of each story so people can send their own stories
** Look for events in each team's wiki
