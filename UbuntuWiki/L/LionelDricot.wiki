I'm an OpenSource Evangelist that like to write (in french, mostly), to talk in front of a large crowd an to travel. I'm the founder and administrator of fritalk.com Jabber server (more than 4000 accounts) and the writer of an <nowiki>[[http://www.eyrolles.com/Accueil/Livre/9782212120035/livre-ubuntu-efficace.php|Ubuntu french book]]</nowiki>. I studied Engineering at <nowiki>[[http://www.uclouvain.be|UCL]]</nowiki> in Belgium and I'm working as a research engineer.

My favourites projects in the FLOSS world are Ubuntu (of course), Debian, GNOME, GStreamer and Jabber.
You've maybe seen me in the following communities : Ubuntu, Ubuntu-fr, Ubuntu-be, gnomefr, jabberfr, LouvainLiNux, Andesi,...

Besides OpenSource, my interests in life are Space & Astronomy, Technology, Martial Arts, Sports, <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature|Literature]]</nowiki> and Travels around the world.

----------------------------

=== What have I done in the OpenSource world ? ===
(it won't be of any interest to you. I just want to keep tracks of what I did )

As from January 2008, I'm not a Ubuntu member anymore and I spend as less time as possible in front of my computer. I'm still a heavy Ubuntu enthousiast and I still do conferences from time to time. Please do not contact me anymore for technical stuffs.

2007 :
* I used to be an active member of http://forum.ubuntu-fr.org and http://ubuntuforums.org , helping newbies and writing howto.
* I maintained the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LaptopTestingTeam/ToshibaSatelliteU200-163|Toshiba Satellite U200-163]]</nowiki> page and the related ThinkFinger howto. 
* Hacking and helping on the <nowiki>[[http://www.bongo-project.org/|Bongo]]</nowiki> mail & calendar server.
* Hacking on <nowiki>[[http://conseil.fritalk.com|Conseil Bug Triager]]</nowiki>
* On November 11, I spent the day with NicolasDaLuzDuque to install Ubuntu on the public computers of Infor Jeunes, Waterloo (Belgium)
* On October 31, I gave a conference at Louvain-la-Neuve (Belgium) to introduce Ubuntu and the benefits of Free Software Development.
* From Frebuary to June 2007, I hold a short weekly chronicle about free softwares on <nowiki>[[http://www.purefm.be/|PureFM radio]]</nowiki>
* On April 28, for <nowiki>[[http://www.installfest.info/FLISOL2007/|FLISOL 2007]]</nowiki>, I gave <nowiki>[[http://ploum.frimouvy.org/?143-flisol-2007-in-guadalajara|a conference about Ubuntu and the Free Software world in Guadalajara]]</nowiki>, Mexico.
* I'm the editor of the Feisty Fawn "Linux Identity Set" Magazine (in French), Oxypress editions.
 
2006 : 
* On Novembre 14, I gave a conference at Louvain-la-Neuve, introducing more than 70 people to Ubuntu, Linux and Free Softwares. This was a Louvain-Li-Nux event.
* The second edition of my <nowiki>[[http://www.eyrolles.com/Accueil/Livre/9782212120035/livre-ubuntu-efficace.php|Ubuntu book]]</nowiki> is available ! Lot of new goodness including a CC licensed chapter about the command line (see <nowiki>[[http://ploum.frimouvy.org/?124-ubuntu-efficace|the announce on my blog]]</nowiki> for more informations).
* As a Summer Of Code, I did the <nowiki>[[http://conseil.fritalk.com/conseil|Conseil]]</nowiki> software wich is an hard client interface against launchpad. Shame on me, it is not yet finished. It can read bugs but not modify them. I think I will not work on it before launchpad as true XML-RPC support.
* Bugs reporting and triaging in both Gnome and Ubuntu Bugzilla.
* Working on specifications for Dapper
* I wrote an article for <nowiki>[[http://ploum.frimouvy.org/?2006/06/01/110-the-long-time-support-flying-car|6.06 LTS release]]</nowiki> (<nowiki>[[http://ploum.frimouvy.org/?2006/06/01/111-la-voiture-volante-long-time-support|french translation]]</nowiki>)

See <nowiki>[[http://ploum.frimouvy.org/?2006/01/06/88-ubuntu-le-livre|my blog]]</nowiki> for more informations. It was a commerical success according to the editor.

* I've launched Ubuntu-be, the BelgianTeam at FOSDEM, making <nowiki>[[http://ploum.frimouvy.org/?2006/03/01/97-it-s-a-long-way-to-the-top|a little speech]]</nowiki>. Ubuntu-be is now rocking thanks to a lof of very talented people, speaking a mix of both languages of our lovely country.

* I did the official <nowiki>[[http://ploum.frimouvy.org/?2006/02/23/96-say-hello-to-your-planet|sabdfl hackergotchi]]</nowiki> ! Not kidding, that's my greatest contribution so far.

* I've been working on a french book about Ubuntu for Eyrolles Editions

2004 : 
* In July, Sébastien Bacher (seb128), invited me as an Ubuntu beta tester. I wrote a long review of the Warty-beta. The only "souvenir" : http://people.ubuntulinux.org/~mako/ubuntu-traffic/u20040903_02.html (look for "ploum")
* For Warty, I wrote the first Ubuntu FAQ in french (there was no french ubuntu website at this time). This FAQ was used as one of the first documentation of ubuntu-fr.org and was widely consulted. I also wrote an article <nowiki>[[http://ploum.frimouvy.org/?2004/10/21/4-ensemble-les-yeux-leves-vers-le-ciel|for Warty release]]</nowiki>.
* I also wrote an howto about installing Warty on a very old laptop : http://wiki.frimouvy.org/CompaqPresario . (I receive a lot of email about this page and helped some people to have sound on their Compaq )

* I was doing bugs reporting and triaging in both Gnome and Ubuntu Bugzilla. 

2003 and before : 
* I wrote a long text called <nowiki>[[http://wiki.frimouvy.org/ThePerfectDesktop|The Perfect Desktop]]</nowiki>. It was a long list of recommandations to make Debian+Gnome the perfect desktop. Just what Ubuntu did !
* I was at this time a member of the french debian community. (reporting bugs, writing documentation and helping newbies on http://andesi.org )
* I was for a few months responsible of the french translation of TheOpenCD.
* I was the webmaster, for more than a year of "La Grenouille Bleue", a website that was promoting free software under Windows
* I did <nowiki>[[ftp://ftp.crans.org/pub/Install-party/Lionel_Dricot.ogm|a speech at Cachan]]</nowiki> about the use of OpenOffice. I also published an <nowiki>[[http://www.framasoft.net/article1891.html|how-to]]</nowiki> about installing OpenOffice in an professionnal environment.
