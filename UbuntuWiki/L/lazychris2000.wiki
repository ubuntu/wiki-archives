I work for a computer repair shop in Anchorage, AK and on my free time, I enjoy playing around on the computers (which, according to my wife, far too many) that I have collected over the years.  Now that I have discovered the LaptopTestingTeam, I hope to contribute some of my time and energy to helping out the ubuntu community. Check out my simple little website: http://www.angelfire.com/wv/xmorgan/LinuxLaptops/
