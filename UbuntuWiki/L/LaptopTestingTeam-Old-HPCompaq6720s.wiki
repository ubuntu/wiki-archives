__TOC__

* Contact: MaciejStrzelecki, OttoKekäläinen
* Make: HP
* Brand: Compaq 6720s (HP6720s)
* Model: GR645EA, GB901ET
* Website: http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/pl/pl/sm/WF06b/1090723-1124065-1124065-1124065-12434458-80464608-80632501.html

=== Current Issues ===
* Desktop effects does not work, has issues in Compiz and thus is <nowiki>[[http://wiki.compiz-fusion.org/Hardware/Blacklist|blacklisted]]</nowiki>.
* * Can be circumvented by disabling the blacklisting and using only mplayer/x11 to play videos.

=== System Info ===
Hewlett-Packard
HP Compaq 6720s
F.04 (Hardy test machine had F.09)

=== Old BIOS versions ===

* BIOS versions below F.03 are known to give network problems. A workaround is to boot with the kernel option "pci=noacpi" which allows you to download a newer BIOS. See <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.22/+bug/151887]]</nowiki>

==== Notes ====

* wireless needs firmware: install package ''bcm43xx-fwcutter'', but still gives error "MAC suspend failed" (see bug:https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/153358)
* * can be circumvented using ndiswrapper and driver form windows xp; 
   in Hardy ndiswrapper breaks suspend and hibernate
* mic needs better volume settings: activate recording and turn up channel ''capture'' to 80 %
* cpu frequency scaling works only by selecting module P4_clockmod explicitly
* network install in Hardy failed when PC Card services were started
* Hardy network install needed vga=771 option
