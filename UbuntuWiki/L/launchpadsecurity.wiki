__TOC__

To ensure that launchpad.net is fairly 'secure tm' the following issues should be monitored and hopefully fixed.
Rational: launchpad.net hosts code repositories, bug tracking(private bugs as well as public), ppa's and various other services. Some of these services are more 'critical' than others. If an attacker is able to compromise a user's ppa they may use it to compromise those using the ppa via back-doored packages.
