__TOC__

* Contact: [JiPi] (Hoary and Breezy), VickiNemeth (Dapper 32-bit) (help accepted)
* Make: ACER
* Brand: Aspire
* Model: 5004WLMi
* Website: http://www.acer.com/
* S/N: Only needed if you have a Canonical supplied laptop
=== Current Issues ===
* The default bootup vga console makes the screen roll over to the top which makes it difficult for setup. Setting vga=791 solves the problem tentatively.
* Changing the brightness of the LCD backpanel using the Function keys sometimes put the system to hibernate mode
* Wireless with Broadcom BCM94318 therefore requires ndiswrapper (latest from sourceforge with 64-bit windows drivers (which ACER doesn't have for this model) and therefore requires picking up the driver from another notebook reference.
* x works from scratch but it is integrated video which Thomas Winischhofer does not recommend. Let's see if it can be put into accelerated mode.
