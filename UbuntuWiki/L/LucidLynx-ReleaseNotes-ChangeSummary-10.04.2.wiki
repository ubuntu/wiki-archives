__TOC__


The following is a brief summary of bugs fixed between Ubuntu 10.04.1 and 10.04.2. '''This summary covers only changes to packages in ''__main__'' and ''__restricted__'', which account for all packages in the officially-supported CD images; there are further changes to various packages in ''universe'' and ''multiverse''.''' Some of these fixes were by Ubuntu developers directly, while others were by upstream developers and backported to Ubuntu. For full details, see the individual package changelogs.

In addition to the bugs listed below, this update includes all security updates from the <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/usn|Ubuntu Security Notice list]]</nowiki> affecting Ubuntu 10.04 LTS that were released up to and including Feb 7, 2011. The last update included was USN-1059-1 (Dovecot).

To understand the changes made between Ubuntu 10.04 and 10.04.1 please see the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LucidLynx/ReleaseNotes/ChangeSummary/10.04.1 |10.04.1 change summary]]</nowiki>.

== Known Issues ==

If you are trying to create an installation CD or USB for a 10.04 based release from a 10.10 or later system, you may run into Bug:645818.  The workaround is documented in the report. Typing 'live' or 'help' (without the quotes) at the boot: prompt allow the user to proceed with the installation.

On some specific hardware systems, oem-config fails to start after reboot.  Current status and workarounds for some releases, can be found in Bug:650703.

== Changes Since 10.04.1 ==

=== Installation and Boot Fixes ===

Updated CD images are provided with this release, including fixes for some installation bugs. (Many installation problems are hardware-specific; for those, see "Hardware support bugs" below.)

|-
| grub2
| Bug:591202

|-
| plymouth

| cdrom_id: Handle pre-MMC2 drives which do not yet support the 0x46 "GET CONFIGURATION" SCSI command. If we have those, fall back to the 0x51 "READ DISC INFORMATION" call. This can only differentiate between CD-RW and CD-R, but first that's better than a complet detection failure, and second, those old drives likely don't support more modern media in the first place.

In that case, check if cd_media_compat() detected that there is a disc present, and assume that we have a CD-ROM medium. (Regression from Ubuntu 9.10). (LP: #653568)

|-
| coreutils

| Other fixes (LP: #643460)
|-
| mountall
| Bug:649591
| Fix infinite loop when one of mountall's private mount options is followed by a comma, and guard against other reasons why cut_options might end up comparing a zero-length option (LP: #649591).
|-
| mountall
| Bug:569365
| conf/mountall.conf: set $LANG so that messages appearing in plymouth are translated (LP: #569365); this is a temporary workaround until upstart is fixed to pass the appropriate env vars to all init scripts
|-
| nfs-utils
| Bug:525154
| debian/nfs-common.statd.upstart, debian/nfs-common.statd-mounting.upstart: refactor startup to wait for local-filesystems. (LP: #525154)
|-
| openssl
| Bug:590639
| Update AES-NI patch to openssl-0.9.8-aesni-modes-perlasm-win32-v4.patch from http://rt.openssl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=2067, fixing segfault on engine initialisation (LP: #590639).
|-
| portmap
| Bug:525154
| debian/upstart renamed to debian/portmap.portmap.upstart, debian/portmap.portmap-boot.upstart, debian/rules: Added to set special ON_BOOT flag during boot, which allows statd to use an AND with 'started portmap ON_BOOT=y'. This version of portmap is a dependency of nfs-utils to fix LP: #525154
|-
| tftp-hpa
| Bug:683955
| debian/patches/02-socket.patch: Backport upstream patch to fix syslog bug when rotating log files. (LP: #683955)
|-
| ureadahead
| Bug:491943
| Count the number of CPUs and divide buffer_size_kb by the number of CPUs. Users should watch for instances of "mmiotrace has lost events" in dmesg to make sure the trace buffers are not too small. The original value for buffer_size_kb was chosen somewhat arbitrarily. Empirical testing has shown that its large enough, so we don't actually know where the lower boundary lies. LP: #491943
