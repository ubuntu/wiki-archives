==== Notes ====
Under Breezy there were problems with ipw2200 wireless. 
When using WEP, would not connect to and AP ("ipw2200: Firmware error detected. Restarting." errors in kern.log), when using no encryption it would connect fine. 
Upgraded ipw2200 drivers to 1.0.10 and firmware version 2.4 from ipw2200.sf.net and everything was fine.
