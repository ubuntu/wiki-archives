==== Notes ====

1) Does not work out of the box. You have to install the fglrx driver. Version >= 8.25 is broken and needs manual fix to work for Radeon 9000 Series. This worked for me: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=197471

2) Might work with this tool: http://tz.exit0.net/tecras1.html

3) Ipw2100, works out of the box! Yeah!

4) Works only if System boots up in docking station. If you connect it after Xserver started, you need to restart X to get external monitor and PS/2 of the docking station to work.

5) Might work with kernel >= 2.6.17
