* LAN does not work (Agere something chip). It was not automatically detected and I didn't try further.
* Modem not testet
* No composite support (because of poor ATI drivers)

| Installation works?
| With Issues.<<BR>>I had to use the alternate install CD, because the X-Server for the graphical install didn't come up. Root cause seems to be the VESA driver, however I have no clue why it doesn't work. Anyway, installing in text mode works fine. See more information below.

==== Installation Instruction ====
As mentioned, the default VESA driver does not work, so you have to use the Alternate CD to install in text mode. After installation, the X-Server doesn't come up, so you will have to install the proprietary ATI driver to make X work. First, login on the text mode console with the username you configured during installation. There, type: <pre>
sudo apt-get install xorg-driver-fglrx
</pre>
After rebooting your system should come up with a graphical login screen. However, you still have to configure the native resolution of the display. Open a console window and type
<code>sudo vi /etc/X11/xorg.conf</code>. Search for the section "Screen", and there for the subsection "Display". Modify each line which begins with "Mode" as follows: <<BR>>
Before editing:<pre>
SubSection "Display"
   Depth 24
   Modes "1024x768" "800x600" "640x480"
EndSubSection
</pre>
After editing:<pre>
SubSection "Display"
   Depth 24
   Modes "1280x800" "1024x768" "800x600" "640x480"
EndSubSection
</pre>
Then log out and kill your X-Server by pressing CTRL+ALT+Backspace. Then it should automatically restart using the native display resolution.

==== Notes ====

Will be improved soon ;)
