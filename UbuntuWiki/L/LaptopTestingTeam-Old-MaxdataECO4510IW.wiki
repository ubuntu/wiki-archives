=== Current Issues ===
Problem with connecting external monitor. I tried to connect external TV but was not able to do it. The xorg configurator has greyed out the option to set secondary screen. Also Fn-F4 does not work. But TV is not a standard VGA monitor, so in theory it is possible that it would work with standard monitor.

==== Notes ====

[1] Default resolution is 1024 x 768, and native screen resolution (1280x800) is not listed in System->Preferences->Screen Resolution. This may be though quite easily fixed installing and running 915resolution package.

[2] The only invalid thing is Font settings (System->Preferneces->Appearance->Fonts) - should be set to "subpixel smoothing" by default; you need to change it manually 

[3] After suspend, sometimes wireless network does not work, and I'm not able to turn it on without system restart
