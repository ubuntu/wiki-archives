=== Current Issues ===

Wireless needs acer_wmi, which finally works but is still not modprobed and used by default.

Compiz doesn't work with open drivers (it just says
    Found laptop using ati driver. 
    aborting and using fallback: /usr/bin/metacity
). But for instance ppracer does (almost fluently), and glxgears too.

Sleep (suspend to RAM) never works (it did under Gutsy, it usually did under Hardy).

==== Notes ====

* glxgears works and ppracer too; compiz works but is not very fluid

* * Honestly I can't find a difference even when I do it under Window, except an icon appearing on taskbar; I say "no" just because nothing appears in dmesg and nothing seems to happen

* ** xrandr says "screen cannot be larger than 1280x1200". Under Gutsy, I had to change xorg.conf. Under Hardy (live) I just couldn't find it in /etc/X11!

* *** when I try to mirror screen with "Screen resolution" app, screens go black and computer becomes unresponsive; I have unplug the VGA cable to shut it down with Ctrl+Alt+Del. Same thing if I start the PC with the cable already plugged in: with Gutsy, it would automatically mirror screen, with Intrepid it becomes unresponsive.

* **** under Windows there is a nice red light inside the hole, indicating it when it's dark; not under Ubuntu
