==== Notes ====
* {i} '''Refresh Rate''' -Note that 63Hz is acceptable, but according to Toshiba, this display should be able to achieve at a maximum 800x600 (60/70/72/75/85Hz).
 
* {i} '''3D Acceleration''' -Note that this can be achieved by utilizing hacked Mach64 drivers and running at nothing more than 800x600 16-bit color.
