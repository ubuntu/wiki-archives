Welcome to the Lubuntu marketing gallery. Please, take care, if you want to use the SVG sources, you may need the Ubuntu typeface (shipped with Lubuntu) to avoid a graphical disaster :). If you're looking for the official Lubuntu artwork, it's here. If you would like to know about Lenny, the Lubuntu mascot, go here. For Press Releases head here.
