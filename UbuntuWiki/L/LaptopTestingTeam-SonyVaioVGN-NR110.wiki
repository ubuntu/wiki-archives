==== Notes ====

== Headphone Jack ==

If you plug in headphones into the headphone jack, sound will come out of both the onboard speakers and headphones. The solution is to set the the driver to ALSA, then turn front all the way up, mute it, then adjust PCM.

== Desktop Effects ==

The Intel 965 in the computer is on the AIGLX blacklist, therefore Desktop Effects will fail.
Either you can install Xgl (this makes fullscreen video - including screensavers - look really choppy), or edit the AIGLX blacklist, by running this command:

<code> gksudo gedit /usr/bin/compiz </code>

and looking for these two lines:

<pre>
 T="$T 8086:2982 8086:2992 8086:29a2 8086:2a02 8086:2a12"  # intel 965
    T="$T 8086:2972" # i965 (x3000) </pre>
and commenting them out with the # character. Then restart X (Ctrl-Alt-Backspace), log in, and enable desktop effects.
