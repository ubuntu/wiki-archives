==== Notes ====

I will write soon here about how I got the touchscreen working. 
Draft!
 1.  Touchscreen issues or howto:
   i. Need to install the P-series touchscreen from: <nowiki>[[http://stz-softwaretechnik.com/~ke/touchscreen/p-series.html]]</nowiki> or <nowiki>[[http://www.conan.de/touchscreen/p-series.html]]</nowiki>
*** Check the instructions on the website
*** My config has the values MinX 100, MinY 200, MaxX 4020 and MaxY 3990 and you can use it with
    <code>setserial /dev/ttyS0 port 0x0220 irq 4 autoconfig</code>
*** When everything works, I will post the xorg.conf file
*** Note: with the new Xorg system you need a .so file instead of .o! In order to change the driver to .SO you need to run this gcc command in the shell:
       <code>gcc -shared -Wl,-soname,fujitsu -o fujitsu_drv.so fujitsu_drv.o</code>
       and then move the newly generated .so to the /usr/lib/xorg/modules/input directory as root.
   i. <nowiki>[[http://touchcal.sourceforge.net]]</nowiki> used for initialize the driver values
   i. also install some on-screen keyboards:
*** xvkbd or matchbox-keyboard (Which is a bit BIG) for virtual online keyboard until viki from KDE comes or use gnome
 1. Sound issues: 
** I am not sure but it seems that the support from ALSA v1.0.14rc1 with STAC 9228 has some issues with the microphone still.  I installed the ALSA from sources (1.0.14rc2) and there is was improvement! I needed the microphone so after some weeks and hard work, I managed to get it right. Here are some bug reports:
** <nowiki>[[https://bugtrack.alsa-project.org/alsa-bug/view.php?id=2901|ALSA Bug 2901 for STAC 9228 (platform one)]]</nowiki>
** <nowiki>[[https://bugtrack.alsa-project.org/alsa-bug/view.php?id=2828|ALSA Bug 2828 for STAC 9221 A1]]</nowiki>
** <nowiki>[[https://bugtrack.alsa-project.org/alsa-bug/view.php?id=2688|ALSA Bug 2688 for STAC 9227]]</nowiki>
** And here is the solution:
    1. Edit /etc/modprobe.d/options file and added at the end:
    <pre>
options snd-hda-intel probe-mask=1 single_cmd=1
</pre>
    2. closed all the apps using sound, including artsd, the the mixer and removed the module snd-hda-intel
    3. reload the module
    4. make sure that you have the ADCMux selected for capture in the switches.
 1. Backlight/brightness of LCD issue:
** By some strange bug, the backlight/brightness setting using the FN keys F6 (for down) F7 (for up) seems to work only between two values. After a closer look, I found that if you reset it to 0:<code>$ echo 0 > /proc/acpi/video/GFX0/LCD/brightness</code>  and later use the FN-F7 to go up, you can change it to the desired level. Probably something wrong in the ACPI reading of the LCD brightness levels. This issue is solved by upgrading the BIOS to version 1.10.
 1. Fingerprint reader:
** The device has the AES2501 08ff:2580 AuthenTec, Inc. fingerprint reader. Although there are some drivers (including the userspace reader package from aes2501-wy) I didn't find a working pam/Bio Authentication software to get it to work.
