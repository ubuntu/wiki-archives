==== Notes ====
Install with an usb mouse connected for X not to freeze.

Add nohz=off to your grub in your kernel line for X not to freeze without a usb mouse connected.

Add the following 2 lines in /etc/init.d/alsa-utils below the STOP)

ifconfig eth0 down

ifconfig eth1 down

in order to have a proper halt (still buggy ...)
