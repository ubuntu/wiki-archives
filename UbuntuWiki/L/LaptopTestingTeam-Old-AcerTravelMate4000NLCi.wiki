==== Notes ====

<nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LaptopTestingTeam/AcerTravelMate4000NLCi/Lspci|VerboseLspciOutput]]</nowiki>

==== (1) ====
 The first time I try to hibernate after a clean boot, the screen goes blank and returns, and it doesnt hibernate. Then, on trying a second time it works. Upon recovering from the hibernation, again the system refuses to hibernate the first time, and works the second.

==== (2) ====
 Xev outputs for Dapper: <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LaptopTestingTeam/AcerTravelMate4000NLCi/Xev|XevOutputs]]</nowiki>

==== (3) ====
 Fn+F1 is supposed to bring on help on hot keys in Windows, instead of that, it ejects the optical drive in Breezy. In Dapper it pops up 'Help Topics' (I know this is not a bug, but if there was an app to edit Fn+ options, and a little help on that along, it would be the perfect program to be bound with this key combination.)

==== (4) ====
 These keys are user-programmable under Windows. Acer supplies the 'Launch Manager' a windows based app to program them. Would someone be interested in writing one for Linux? Please email me regarding this. I am interested too.
