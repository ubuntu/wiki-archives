==== Notes ====
* Dock audio is considered a different audio output, and the volup/voldn/mute keys on the dock (replicates laptop's volume control keys) only control the laptop speaker output, not the dock (laptop speakers are muted while connected to the dock).
* Laptop fails to restore from sleep mode.
