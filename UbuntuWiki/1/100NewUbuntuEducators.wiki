=== 100 new Ubuntu users project tracking page ===

Page to track Dinda's progress in the <nowiki>[[100UsersProject]]</nowiki>.  

My personal goal is to introduce Educators to Ubuntu.  Over the summer of 2010 I hope to reach out to teachers and others in the Education field to show them how easy it is to use Ubuntu and start to integrate FLOSS into their curriculum and for personal use.
