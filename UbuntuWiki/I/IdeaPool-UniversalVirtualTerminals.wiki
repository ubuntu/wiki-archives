__TOC__

This would be a big, kernel-involved change:

I would like dtach-like functionality to be the default for all ttys.
I want to be able to open, close, detach, attach, pause, resume, lock, record, playback
any tty. It would allow conserver-like access to all ttys. It would replace or underly
Linux virtual consoles.  There are various addons and hacks that give you part of
this functionality, but not all of it, everywhere.
