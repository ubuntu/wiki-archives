== Introduction ==
Intrepid Ibex is the codename for Kubuntu 8.10, due out in at the end of October.

The focus for 8.10 for the Kubuntu community will be transitioning to a KDE 4 desktop. The plan is to integrate our existing Kubuntu software while at the same time offering the best out-of-the-box KDE 4 experience around. Intrepid Ibex is a whole new revolution for us, Intrepidly going where no Kubuntu release has gone before.

Alpha 5, the first in a series of milestone CD images that will be released throughout the Intrepid development cycle, represents the very latest snapshots of Intrepid. The pre-release images are known to be reasonably free of CD-build or installer bugs, however they are not recommended for use in stable environments. These releases will be for those who are developing, documenting, and testing. Alpha releases can be downloaded from the following URL:
* http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/releases/intrepid/

'''NOTE:''' ''This is an alpha (pre-) release. Pre-release versions of Intrepid are '''__NOT__''' encouraged for anyone needing a stable system or for anyone who is not comfortable running into occasional, even frequent, breakage. Pre-release versions of Intrepid '''__ARE__''' recommended for Kubuntu developers and those who want to help in testing, reporting, and fixing bugs.''

== New or Improved In Alpha 5 ==
The Intrepid Ibex Alpha 5 CD release brings with it many updated, new, and exciting applications. For this latest release of Kubuntu 8.10, many Kubuntu tools have been more tightly integrated with our KDE4 desktop. Besides these changes, there have been updates to many common applications as well as bug fixes to some of those annoyances you may or may not have run into. With every new pre-release, updates will be documented allowing you to thoroughly test your Kubuntu 8.10 installation. Remember that all of these features are part of a pre-release version of Kubuntu, and may still have issues. We ask that any problems you come across that you file a bug, if one has yet to be filed for your problem.<<BR>>

=== KDE 4.1.1 ===

Intrepid Ibex alpha 5 brings with it the latest and greatest KDE. KDE 4.1.1 robustifies the impressive set of features put in place in <nowiki>[[http://kde.org/announcements/4.1/|KDE 4.1]]</nowiki>. Notable changes include:
*** Significant performance, interaction and rendering correctness improvements in KHTML and Konqueror, KDE's webbrowser
*** User interaction, rendering and stability fixes in Plasma, the KDE4 desktop shell
*** PDF backend fixes in the document viewer Okular
*** Fixes in Gwenview, the image viewer's thumbnailing, more robust retrieval and display of images with broken metadata
*** Stability and interaction fixes in KMail

=== Adept 3.0 Beta1 ===
{{http://www.kubuntu.org/~jriddell/alpha5-adept-wee.png}}

'''INFO:''' http://web.mornfall.net/blog/adept_3.0_alpha_6.html <<BR>>

Intrepid Ibex alpha5 comes with an all-new KDE4 version of the Adept Package manager. It features a new, re-factored user interface and is much more stable, responsive, while at the same time being lighter on resources than Adept 2.1.

=== Apport-by-default/update-notfier-kde ===

{{http://i31.photobucket.com/albums/c355/Woremar/update-apport-hooks.png}}

The all new update-notifier-kde serves as an update-notifier and an apport crash notifier for Intrepid Ibex. The current release also supports notification for the need of a reboot as well as upgrade hooks. 
Note that you will have to run "sudo apt-get dist-upgrade" before update-notifier-kde will work at all, due to a bug that was fixed after alpha5 CD generation.

=== Desktop effects by default ===
{{http://www.kubuntu.org/~jriddell/alpha5-compositing-wee.png}}

KWin's nifty desktop effects will work by default in Kubuntu Intrepid Ibex as long as your card is supported and you have mesa-utils installed. Otherwise they will be turned off automagically and you won't notice the difference.

=== KMix support for keyboard multimedia keys ===
{{http://www.kubuntu.org/~jriddell/alpha5-volume.png}}

In Intrepid Ibex alpha5, KMix now supports the multimedia-button functionality that various keyboards offer.

=== KNetworkManager 0.7 ===
'''INFO:''' http://en.opensuse.org/Projects/KNetworkManager <<BR>>
''KMenu -> Internet -> KNetworkManager''

KNetworkManager is the KDE front end for NetworkManager. It provides a sophisticated and intuitive user interface which enables users easily to switch their network environment. Intrepid Ibex alpha5 brings with it NetworkManager 0.7. Unfortunately, KNetworkManger, NetworkManager's KDE frontend, is broken due to various NetworkManager API changes that occurred a short while before alpha5's release.

=== Various Kubuntu tool integration ===
Numerous Kubuntu tools have been given greater integration with KDE4 with a port from PyQt4 to PyKDE4. Applications that have received PyKDE4 ports include:
* GDebiKDE, the Kubuntu .deb installation frontend.
* Jockey-KDE, the Kubuntu proprietary driver manager frontend
* Language Selector Qt, the Kubuntu language selection/installation manager
* Software-properties-kde, the apt sources.list editor for Kubuntu
* system-config-printer-kde, the Kubuntu/KDE printer manager
