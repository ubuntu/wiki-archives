==== About me ====

I am a Canonical employee and currently working as a Hardware Enablement Engineer in the Kernel Team. I have worked on various parts specializing in BIOS architecture, UEFI, ACPI and platform subsystems in Linux kernel.

I am a maintainer of efi_test kernel driver which provides interfaces to access the UEFI runtime services and also a maintainer of firmware test suite (FWTS). I've also contributed to UEFI shim, firmware update and tpm2-tools projects.
