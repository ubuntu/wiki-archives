Ubuntu History [ref http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_%28operating_system%29]

Ubuntu is a computer operating system based on the Debian GNU/Linux distribution and distributed as free and open source software. It is named after the Southern African philosophy of Ubuntu ("humanity towards others"). With an estimated global usage of more than 12 million users, Ubuntu is designed primarily for desktop use, although netbook and server editions exist as well. Web statistics suggest that Ubuntu's share of Linux desktop usage is about 50%, and indicate upward trending usage as a web server.

Ubuntu is sponsored by the UK-based company Canonical Ltd., owned by South African entrepreneur Mark Shuttleworth. Canonical generates revenue by selling technical support and services tied to Ubuntu, while the OS itself is entirely free of charge.

Ubuntu's first release was on October 20, 2004. Since then, Canonical has released new versions of Ubuntu every six months with commitment to support each release for eighteen months by providing security fixes, patches to critical bugs and minor updates to programs. It was decided that every fourth release, issued on a two-year basis, would receive long-term support (LTS). LTS releases are supported for three years on the desktop and five years on the server. The latest LTS release is Ubuntu 10.04 (Lucid Lynx), released on April 29, 2010, while the latest normal release is Ubuntu 10.10 (Maverick Meerkat), released on October 10, 2010.

Naming conventions: Year.Month with (mostly) alpha codename, i.e. Maverick Meerkat.
