== Introduction (from the Songbird website) ==

<nowiki>[[http://www.songbirdnest.com/|Songbird]]</nowiki>™ is a desktop Web player, a digital jukebox and Web browser mash-up. Like Winamp, it supports extensions and skins feathers. Like Firefox®, it is built from Mozilla®, cross-platform and open source.

Note that Songbird is currently in development and the version available for download is intended for developers. Songbird is notable for providing numerous user-friendly ways to find music and the ease of downloading it.

== Installing Songbird with a .deb ==

'''For Songbird version 1.2.0 '''

     '''32bit/64bit''' Ubuntu users: download and install this <nowiki>[[http://unter-hund.com/2009/11/08/songbird-1-2-0-installer/|.deb]]</nowiki>.

After installing the .deb file, go to Applications - Sound and Video - Songbird to launch the program.

== Installing Songbird Manually ==

To install Songbird first download thier most recent release from http://www.songbirdnest.com/.
Save the tar.gz file to your desktop, open it and extract Songbird folder to your Desktop. 

The tar.gz file is not songbirds source, just it's bianaries so you'll have to install it by copying the contents of Songbird, now on your desktop, to your /sbin/ folder. To do so, in terminal, type: 

   sudo cp -r Desktop/Songbird /sbin/

Once you do that you can add a launcher to your Desktop or Gnome menu using Alacarte.
In Alacarte, goto File - New Entry. Put Songbird (or anything) for the name, and under Command put:

   /sbin/Songbird/Songbird

And you're ready to go! 

To remove, just goto a terminal and type:

   sudo rm -R /sbin/Songbird
