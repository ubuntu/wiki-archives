__TOC__

* We helped spread the word of Open source software and ubuntu on the open source day in Israel.
* We had a booth on the biggest sci-fi convention in Israel, the Icon. In this event we gave over 200 Ubuntu CDs, sold Ubunchu comics and earned 500₪ (about 100 Euro) of donations.
* We have started to push all the part of publishing Ubuntu, so we have printed Ubuntu fliers and Credit cards. for that we have also got a donation from "Hamkor" association for having a rollup for our booths.
* we have started planning our Ubuntu 10.10 Release party :)
