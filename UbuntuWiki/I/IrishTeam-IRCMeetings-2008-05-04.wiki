May 04 21:11:24 <Mean-Machine>	we don't have access to configure the page
May 04 21:12:00 <Mean-Machine>	so I reported this as a bug on launchpad -> https://bugs.launchpad.net/loco-webhosting/+bug/226502
May 04 21:12:39 <Mean-Machine>	I'll be updating everyone on this matter through mailing list
May 04 21:12:52 <ebel>	Deadly. :)

May 04 21:23:48 <Mean-Machine>	hmmm, maybe I'll just drop a line on the ILUG mailing list? or is that rude?

May 04 21:29:44 <ompaul>	it ain't rude
May 04 21:31:29 <Mean-Machine>	ok, another thing that I thought about is http://softwarefreedomday.org/   I know its very early, but I like to think/plan ahead

May 04 21:34:35 <ebel>	but yeah that is really early. :)
May 04 21:35:52 <Mean-Machine>	again, I think it should be organized together with ILUG... well, if they'd be interested of course
