Hello,

I'm currently a PhD student in the Athens University of Economics and Business (AUEB). I'm in the second year of my research which targets OSS development projects and the people behind them. Mostly i am interested in the social networks that form in various levels in an OSS project and also across different projects.

Through my initial study i have seen there is a large knowledge base regarding OSS and its development but also its relation to other fields of study and the possibility to use it as a paradigm and a successful practice. I understand that this project has a similar confident aim and i am very excited that i will get a chance to contribute in any level i can.
