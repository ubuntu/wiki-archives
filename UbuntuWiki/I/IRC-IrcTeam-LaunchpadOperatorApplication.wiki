If you want to contribute to Ubuntu by acting as an operator on those Ubuntu IRC channels that you are active on, you can simply say so on Launchpad!

Through this process anyone can express their interest in contributing through operator work. So if you’re active on our IRC channels and you think your channel has too few operators, and if you’ve been aching to help, you should consider applying for membership! You might get your chance if

* You are great at resolving conflicts
* You are very patient. Superhuman nerve control is a basic IRC operator feature
* You can take criticism
* You are happy when helping and advising others
* In addition to the <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/about/about-ubuntu/conduct|Code of Conduct]]</nowiki> and our <nowiki>[[IRC-Guidelines|IRC Guidelines]]</nowiki>, you are happy to adhere to some <nowiki>[[IRC-IrcTeam-OperatorGuidelines|additional guidelines]]</nowiki> :)

In general, please do not consider becoming an operator because it could be “fun”. It is not, it’s hard work. However, it is often quite rewarding, and you get to operate with a great team of people. You don’t need to be an IRC guru, but you do need to know enough to be able to learn more.

Please be aware that *many* applicants will not become operators for various reasons. This will not necessarily be because we think you would make a bad operator. Only a limited number of operators are ever needed, some timezones are better covered already than others, and so on.

If you feel that you could be a good addition to the IRC Team, please head on to Launchpad and apply to the <nowiki>[[IRC-IrcTeam-Scope|team corresponding to the channel]]</nowiki> you want to help in, and create a Wiki page where you explain why you want to join and why you would be a good operator. Think of the wiki page as your resume. Gather testimonials from other people who know you and believe you qualify. Think of those as your references.

Before you do any of the above, be sure to study <nowiki>[[IRC-IrcTeam-OperatorRequirements|the official requirements and application process]]</nowiki>, to ensure everything is well with your application and it will be considered whenever new operators are needed.
