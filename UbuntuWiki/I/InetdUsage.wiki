== netkit-inetd in Ubuntu ==

Goal: Remove `netkit-inetd` from Ubuntu base since it is a rather
useless daemon running as root.

Maintainer scripts should use `update-inetd` from package `netbase`
rather than directly touch `/etc/inetd.conf`. `update-inetd` works
correctly (i. e. modifies `inetd.conf`) even if `netkit-inetd` is not
installed.

If `netkit-inetd` is removed from base, then packages that use it either need an explicit dependency, or inetd support should be dropped at all (it's off by default in most packages anyway).

=== Main packages that use inetd ===

* cupsys-bsd (debconf question, off by default)
* cvs (for pserver, debconf question, off by default)
* exim4-base (commented out yet, for Etch version)
* exim4-config (disabling obsolete smtp inetd service, should work fine)
* libc6 (for restarting services, should work fine)
* isdnvboxserver
* netbase (dependency, can be dropped to Recommends)
* postfix (for unconditionally disabling smtp in inetd, should work fine)
* quota (postrm: disable rquotad; however, postinst does not enable it)
* samba (offers obsolete possibility to run smbd/nmbd from inetd, off by default)
* ubuntu-base (explicitly depends on `netkit-inetd`, although `netbase` already depends on it)
* tftpd-hpa (debconf question, on by default)
* vsftpd (disables inetd conf on upgrade, older versions used inetd.conf; should work fine)
* xinetd (surprise)
