__TOC__

The Intel D945GCCR motherboard had no installation problems with Feisty Fawn 7.04.  I was searching the internet for a good source to verify compatibility of Intel motherboards and Ubuntu without success.  Please post your experience with motherboards under Hardware Support.

I'm running a 3.0 GHz CPU with 512 MB System Memory and using the built in video.  I'm also using an ide hard drive and ide cdrom drive for testing.  More test results to follow with the different Ubuntu releases.

Any questions, info@wolfland.net
Thanks!
Dave

I'm running a 4.0 GHz CPU with 512 MB System Memory and using the built in video and sound. All works under Mint Cassandra.
