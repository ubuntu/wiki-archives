__TOC__

Currently helping on getting <nowiki>[[http://www.freegeekvancouver.org|Free Geek Vancouver]]</nowiki>  started.  Also maintain a local CAP site at  <nowiki>[[http://www.spartacusbooks.org|Spartacus Books]]</nowiki>, and I also do some work with BC Wireless with the Hotspot project and other embedded stuff.

Do boring QA stuff during the day as well.  I use Ubuntu for most of my Linux work.
