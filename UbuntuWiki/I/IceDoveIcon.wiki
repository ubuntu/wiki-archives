| ''A little easier to make it square this time, although I'm at a loss to make it any "icier." And it wouldn't do to make this one blue, since it's a dove. Is there such a thing as a blue dove? -- K.Mandla

| Very nice.  You might try making it slightly bluer, for more icyness.  Another possibility would be to add some icicles to it, but that might or might not actually look good.  Maybe some faint blue streaks trailing the wings?  (BTW, what software do you use?  Do you use a tablet?  Did you draw the dove yourself?  It'd be really cool if you made a page on the Wiki explaining your techniques.
