__TOC__

* Got new hosting on ubuntu-eu servers so development of an Israeli Ubuntu portal is now starting in a much faster pace.
* We soon get a donated server to do what we want with - probably a development server for now.
* A more solid team is starting to build up as people use the same platforms to communicate (our forums and wiki mostly getting mroe popular).
* An initial version of a script that automatically creates Hebrew-enabled Ubuntu ISO files was written. Another step closer to mass Ubuntu distribution in Israel.
