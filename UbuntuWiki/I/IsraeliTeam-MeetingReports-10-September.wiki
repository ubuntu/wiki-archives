__TOC__

The decisions for this month are as follows.
* We are going to keep our relations with Ilan Ramon center on helping the kids there with Ubuntu and other stuff.
* We are going to keep sending people CD's when wanted/needed to advertise to others. the payment will come from the donation money we get.
* We will have rotation on the position of head meeting, that way any one that wants to help will be able to do it and on the same time we will better know him for more important positions.
** If someone will abuse the position moshe742 will take charge on the meeting.
* We will make publications on facebook any way we can that won't get into the privacy of others.
