=== Your Name ===

innovati is tom hodgins, canadian graphic designer.

I use: 
* inkscape 
* scribus
* GIMP
* kubuntu 

I hope to be making some artwork for (k)ubuntu in the next couple of years and working as a linux artist is my dream job.

I've stashed a simple portfolio of a few clippings of my work here: <nowiki>[[http://tomhodgins.googlepages.com/portfolio.pdf]]</nowiki>

enjoy, and have a great day!
