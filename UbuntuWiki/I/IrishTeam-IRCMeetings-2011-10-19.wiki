 20:08:01 <czajkowski> PRESENT

 20:08:06 <ebel> anseo

 20:08:32 <tdr112> Phere

 20:08:36 <tdr112> here

 20:09:18 <airurando> #topic Review of previous action items

 20:09:35 <airurando> no meeting last month

 20:10:42 <airurando> no outstanding action items for August either

 20:10:56 <airurando> on to agenda items proper

 20:11:34 <airurando> #topic Ubuntu 11:10 CDs

 20:11:43 <airurando> tdr112 the floor is yours

 20:11:48 <tdr112> so we will be getting cds soon

 20:12:01 <tdr112> what do we do with them

 20:12:16 <czajkowski> college comp socs ?

 20:12:18 <tdr112> send them to the same epople we did last time

 20:12:25 <czajkowski> hackerspaces?

 20:12:45 <ebel> FYI i have appljed, as official address contact, and shall let the loco know when the arrive at my address

 20:12:48 <tdr112> how about a ubunut hour in dublin to give them to people and save on postege

 20:13:00 <airurando> I have a spreadsheet with all recipients from the last lot

 20:13:11 <czajkowski> cool

 20:13:20 <airurando> tdr112 slashtom suggested that yesterday.

 20:13:41 <airurando> ebel I'll email the spreadsheet to you

 20:14:00 <ebel> i suppose, in general, posting them around, but would auggest reciepients should send a SAE, rather than 1 person (me) paying all postage

 20:14:02 <tdr112> yep its not my idea

 20:14:09 <tdr112> its a good one

 20:14:28 <airurando> I like the Ubuntu Uk approach

 20:14:35 <tdr112> which is

 20:14:47 <airurando> http://www.theopensourcerer.com/2011/10/18/free-ubuntu-11-10-cds-for-the-uk/

 20:14:47 <airurando> http://ubuntu-uk.org/free-cds/

 20:15:03 <airurando> doesn't really work for the bigger packs though

 20:15:28 <ebel> here's an idea: email mailing list, solicit people who want them, if there arent a lot, follow up on people from last time?

 20:15:58 <airurando> ebel need to keep costs down though

 20:16:22 <airurando> all Dublinites or groups should collech at UH

 20:16:28 <tdr112> yep

 20:16:37 <ebel> yes, agreed

 20:16:59 <ebel> could require peollhr who dont collect to semd sae?

 20:17:00 <airurando> for groups around the country we should try a cheap delivery or collection approach

 20:17:15 <airurando> doesn't have to be instantaneous this time

 20:17:19 <ebel> solves the cost problem, since means i wouldnt have to pay anything

 20:17:34 <airurando> I ebel: indeed

 20:17:46 <tdr112> good stuff

 20:17:46 <airurando> I have a request in relation to this

 20:17:56 <ebel> tbh it costs aboit 3 or 4 eur for a sae, not a lpt

 20:19:25 <airurando> I've been chatting to Cathal Garvey of Nexus Cork about the possibility of the hackerspace running a linux workshop for beginners as part of the Lifelong Learning Festival in cork in 2012

 20:19:51 <airurando> Cathal seems positively disposed to this idea

 20:20:15 <ebel> (for dublin hackerspace, tog should get some, but not as much as last tome, tjere were too many left over)

 20:20:31 <tdr112> ebel: yep 20 max

 20:21:18 <ebel> surely all these people will come out of the woodwork when we email ubuntuie mailing list

 20:21:24 <tdr112> yep

 20:21:30 <daxroc> Are these the CDs n Stickers?

 20:21:48 <tdr112> just cds

 20:21:56 <ebel> i doubt (from experiemce) that we'll run out of people to send em too

 20:22:18 <daxroc> Can I request some, I'll pay the shipping  for 4 copys

 20:22:32 <ebel> finding people to give fancy cds to is jot a problem.

 20:22:33 <airurando> could we possibly 'ringfence' a good few for the possibility of a workshop at the Cork Lifelong Learning Festival for April next?

 20:22:51 <airurando> daxroc where are you based.

 20:22:57 <daxroc> Wexford

 20:23:02 <ebel> aitab suppose, how many?

 20:23:36 <airurando> hard to say

 20:23:48 <airurando> might not even happen

 20:23:55 <daxroc> 4, or if you want to leave a few more here for people to collect, im between north and south wexford daily ( mon - fri )

 20:24:13 <ebel> a lot will depemd on who requests cds. i predict i'll get the cds within the next weel or 2

 20:24:14 <czajkowski> airurando: sounds like a plan

 20:24:19 <czajkowski> airurando: also the limerick learning hub

 20:24:37 <tdr112> czajkowski: what is the story with the packs you can order

 20:24:46 <tdr112> are they free

 20:24:55 <tdr112> for eventw

 20:25:01 <tdr112> events

 20:25:06 <ebel> idea: see who requests cds, then have an irc meeting allocate them?

 20:25:13 <airurando> czajkowski: they got some last time through Michael Yonker so yeah

 20:25:24 <ebel> ratjer than me deciding unilaterally who gets em?

 20:25:28 <airurando> ebel good idea

 20:25:28 <tdr112> ok

 20:25:43 <airurando> ebel will you send the mail

 20:25:47 <airurando> ?

 20:26:01 <ebel> Aince ATM we're talking about thjngs we have no idea

 20:26:38 <airurando> any objections

 20:26:41 <czajkowski> airurando: grand

 20:26:52 <ebel> sute ill send the email to the list asking for requests, and again whwn we get them, inviting peoplhr to a meeting to 'plead their case'

 20:27:35 <airurando> #agreed hold seperate meeting to consider requests for CDs

 20:27:48 <ebel> (and i'm ircing over ssh, so get no autocorrect, its not that im drunk :P)

 20:28:08 <tdr112> ebel: sure :)#
