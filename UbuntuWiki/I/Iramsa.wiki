Most Teams' Wiki Home Pages provide information about who they are, what they do, when their meetings are and how to contact them. Using these pages, teammates are able communicate and coordinate projects.

==== Governance and Membership ====

Like most communities, we have our <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/community/conduct|rules]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/project/about-ubuntu/governance|governing body]]</nowiki>.

Anyone can join and participate in most, if not all, of our Teams and Projects. But if you want an "@ubuntu.com" e-mail address, it has to be earned. Find out how in our <nowiki>[[Membership]]</nowiki> section.
