=== About me ===

Email: 
Considering myself computer savvy but far from an expert, have been using Windows mostly but gone over to the light side in honor of bug#1 about a year ago. Mainly interested in programming and have been wetting my nose with C++, C#, Java, PHP and having my target locked on Python for next victim of my attention. 

So far my experiences with Ubuntu have been great and I'm looking forward to contribute back to Ubuntu as a beginner developer, documenter and Swedish translator.

=== Currently involved in following projects ===

* None yet choosen, will do this weekend
