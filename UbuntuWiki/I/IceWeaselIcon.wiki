An '''updated''' script to replace the Iceweasel icons: <nowiki>[[http://github.com/dbbolton/iw-icon-updater/blob/master/iw-icon-updater]]</nowiki>

A script to replace all of the icons in the Iceweasel package (like the package in Debian) can be found at <nowiki>[[http://alphapapa.net/debian/iceweasel/]]</nowiki>

The list has been edited. The icon started by K.Mandla and polished further by several other artists has been put at the top. Take a look at them right here:

|-
| <(> Based on ericesque's version, but with a more Tango-ish globe
|-
| <(> ''Ok, This one has my vote. I like the colors much more, really has an ice feeling. Also the tail fits better for a weasel than the ericesque's and his head is bigger, it looks better on icon-size. Great work to you all, guys. --Ferk''
|-
| <(> The generel opinion seems to be that this icon should be the default for IceWeasel and I couldn't agree more. The Ubuntu community has really done an outstanding job. Several people have helped in the creation of this icon, a big thanks to all of them! I have moved this icon and the earlier versions to the top to make sure the IceWeasel developers will notice them. --Casper2
|-
| <(> ''Beautiful work. This is definitely No. 1 on my list. I'll be using this one no matter what the Gnuzilla team picks. Nice work, everybody! -- K.Mandla''
|-
| <(> ''Hum.. Wait, I think the image needs to be a square to be used as a icon, currently it's 127x168 according to my browser. Also maybe the continents could be just a little more darker so it doesn't get confused with the weasel skin when scaled down? maybe turning the gradient all the way around? but I dont know if that would look good, this looks great anyway.--Ferk''
|-
| <(> It is because of a "bug" in the png version of the icon. For some reason it has a lot of empty space at the top. Download the svg in the forum thread, it is square. -- Casper2

|-
| <(> This is the original by K.Mandla ''-- I prefer IYY's version; I agree that it should be squarer, and I like the idea that the weasel should be bluer, which will make it look "icier." This one sticks to the Tango colors, but aside from that probably needs a little attention to get it within their guidelines. -- K.Mandla''
|-
| <(> ''-- The whole series of icons is gorgeous, but it would be pretty neat if the position of the Earth was changed so that Antarctica was in the center of view.  Not only would it make the logos a bit "icier", it would make them more region neutral. -- TCH''
|-
| <(> '' I second that idea; using Antarctica is brilliant.  :-)''

| <nowiki>[[File:IceWeasel-KMandla-Revision.png]]</nowiki>
|-
| <(> A revision ''-- This is closer to what I like. It's a bit of a cross between SlimDog360's #2 (with the blue-to-white gradients) and IYY's revision (with a squarer shape). I softened the tail a bit (I was looking at weasel tails and decided to make it less "fluffy") and removed the offside eye, which bothered me. This also uses the Gnome globe, which is GNU ... and GNUer is better! Har har. -- K.Mandla''
|-
| <(> ''-- This is a winner by my standards. Square, more blue and it uses a GNU image for the globe. Only problem i have is the current image shows up small on my panels compared to everything else, but im sure this will be fixed when its a .svg or whatever.. --Polygon''
|-
| <(> ''--I still prefer IIY's version. I don't like the gloss on the globe in this one, and you've lost the sparkle of the weasel's tail. Sorry, but I think this is a recession, rather than a revision...--T Smithe''
|-
| <(> ''-- I don't think that blue makes it icier... snow and ice are plain white not blue, it is also harder to see the weasel, since the earth is already blue. --Ferk''
|-
| <(> ''Looking at this on another monitor, it's almost too blue. The image of the weasel I traced it off was almost pure white, and I'm wondering if backing off the blue side and making it more white might also make it more distinguishable at smaller sizes. This might just turn into a blue blob at 48x48. -- K.Mandla''
|-
| <(> ''I really like the icon, but not the lighter spot on top of the globe. How about making a shadow moving over the globe, like day/night, for the page loading version? --HJH ''

|-
| <(> Here my take on the icons. As icons need to be good not only at full size but also at 48x48 et 17x17 (the size of the small icon in top of program window), I've made a PNG for each of the three sizes.
|-
| <(> I think I like these best.  I prefer the gray outline, especially for the ears.  The blue continents emphasize the icyness, and I can't quite explain it, but this weasel's face is the...cutest.  I think it will have wide appeal.  The only suggestion I have is to add some color to the weasel itself, maybe a gradient or two; IMHO the solid color of the weasel clashes a bit with the globe.

| <(> Testing left-headed weasel...
|-
| <(> I prefer the other way round. I wonder (psychologically) why that is, and why most icons have so far been that way around. -- TSmithe
|-
| <(> I think it has something to do with the direction we read and how that relates to viewing pictures in general, imagine if the Earth were a ball and sitting on a flat surface and started to roll, which way would it roll? I hypothesize that most of us native English readers (left to right) will assume that the ball will roll to the right, thus having the Weasel holding the ball on the right side keeps it in place and eliminates any potential movement in the icon and makes it aesthetically more appealing; I personally couldn't stand an icon that looks like it's about to move :> -- Cookiebearo
|-
| <(> That is a very apt explanation, even on an arguable topic! -- T Smithe
|-
| <(> I like this one the best, it seems like the weasel is supporting the globe, helping it stay steady instead of stopping it from moving.  Some of that bias towards left-to-right movement I guess :) -- jgoguen

|-
| <(> Wow, without a doubt my favourite so far! Not sure if that icon follows the Tango guidelines, but if not, it really should. Seems most GNOME apps are moving towards Tango icons, Iceweasel shold too :)
|-
| <(> yeah, I'll get an SVG up later today.  The icon does follow Tango guidelines fairly well.  I still have some slight fine tuning ahead of me.  I'll review the tango guidelines and make sure the icon is following them as closely as possible.  Thanks for the positive feedback.  Please remember this has been a collaborative effort of the community.  I do not take credit for much of what you see.  --ericesque

|-
| <(> Warbo: This looks great, but I wonder what would happen to the weasel when it gets scaled down? This is probably the only decent icon here which deviates from the "look 'n' feel" of the Firefox icon, instead of 'fox burning up on reentry' it is 'I am a friendly weasel who will help you browse the web'. (PS: If it doesn't get chosen, can I adopt the weasel? Pleeeeeease?)
|-
| <(> It's actually a _curious_ weasel, which is even better for a browser. But the icon is just a blueish blob at 17x17.  It should be brighter.
|-
| <(> Great picture, my favourite. But it needs more contrast, because as a small icon it is not recognisable. Please, work on it because otherwise it is a very nice design.

|-
| <(> Beautiful work, but there are a couple of issues. Both the head and the tail are much too canine in appearance. For anyone who's interested, I found a great fullbody photo of a weasel here: <nowiki>[[http://www.mountainsofstone.com/images/Ermine%20on%20Porch.jpg]]</nowiki> -- Parkotron
|-
| <(> Thank you for your opinion. Yes, the tail and head are not good shaped for a weasel, I took an "artistic licence" for those elements, I'll try to re-do both in a real-weasel shape. A little more rectilineal tail and a head shorter and more triangle-like. Another full body image: <nowiki>[[http://images.enature.com/mammals/mammals_l/MA0036_2l.jpg]]</nowiki> and an interesting Siberian/Himalayan weasel photo: <nowiki>[[http://www.kolkatabirds.com/hillbirdsofind/yellowthroatedmarten8.jpg]]</nowiki> - Ruben

| <(> The globe is really nice.  But the weasel doesn't look very weasely.  It also looks rather dead.  Like a weasel-skin-rug... but it definitley has potential. --ericesque
|-
| <(> This icon is FANTASTICAL! I'm using it right now... it's one of the few ones on this page that are actually round enough to be used as an icon :) Thanks for it! The weasel is super cute, ericesque is probably drunk or something. Thanks again!
