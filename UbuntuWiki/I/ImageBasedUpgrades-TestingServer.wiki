== Plans for deployment of a testing server ==

This page contains technical details to elaborate on the <nowiki>[[https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu-system-image/+spec/test-server|blueprint]]</nowiki>, which will be used to track progress.

=== brain dump ===

Lots more needs to be fleshed out:

* talk to stgraber about how to set up a server
* ev & jfunk -> reference server with synthetic paths
* initially in canonistack
* write a charm to stand up a reference server
* replicate for testing
* craft some reasonable test data
