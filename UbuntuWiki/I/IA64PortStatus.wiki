__TOC__

== IA64PortStatus ==

This page summarizes the state and goals of the IA64 Ubuntu port. Though '''not supported''', IA64 binaries are available from the archive, and in fairly decent shape. Specifically:

== Target platforms ==

All Itanium platforms should be supported, although no effort is being made to support Itanium 1.

== State of the port ==
No known issues.

=== Packages status ===
No known issues.
 
=== Outstanding issues ===
No known issues.

=== Kernel status ===
No known issues.

=== Installer status ===
All HP Itanium 2 machines are believed to work. Itanium 1 may fail during X startup (missing Nvidia proprietary driver), but Itanium 1 is not on our target list.

Apparently some installer issues on at least one other platform.
