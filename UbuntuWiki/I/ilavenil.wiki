=== About Me ===
I'm a science teacher with an MPhil in Theoretical Physics. I used Linux and Unix at my University, and I switched to Ubuntu last year. I have several hobbies, including crossword compilation and dabbling in graphics. I've been using Ubuntu for almost a year, and I'm looking forward to a more active part in the community. 

=== Team Memberships ===
==== Ubuntu Women ====
I signed up to the Ubuntu-Women mailing list as soon as I started using Ubuntu. I've also attended some of the IRC meetings, and I hope to be more involved in the team from now on. 

=== IRC ===
I frequently log on to these channels:<<BR>>

=== Future Plan ===
In the future, I see myself<<BR>>
{*} Helping with Ubuntu Classroom - preparing slideshows and content<<BR>>
{*} Getting involved in testing and documentation<<BR>>
{*} Increasing my efforts in Ubuntu advocacy.

=== Graphics ===
These are some graphics that I've done related to Linux/Ubuntu/Ubuntu Women. I'm just a dabbler in graphics, so some of these might not be up to professional standards. If you want to edit these graphics or use them directly, you are free to do so. 

==== Tux in a saree ====
I made this with the Gimp because I wanted an avatar to reflect an Indian female Linux user.

Someone on the Ubuntu IRC suggested putting tux in traditional Indian male attire. This is the result:

==== Ubuntu Women Sticker ====
These are stickers that I've designed as a replacement to the "Intel Inside" one on my PC cabinet. Any suggestions to improve the design are welcome.
