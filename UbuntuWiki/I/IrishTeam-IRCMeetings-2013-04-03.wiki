 19:36:46 <zmoylan> PRESENT

 19:36:47 <airurando> Only one item on the agenda for discussion so lets get to it.

 19:37:02 <airurando> #topic Regarding Raring Ringtailed Racoon Release Revelries

 19:37:09 <tdr112> PRESENT

 19:37:30 <airurando> So I was wondering would we like to host any Release Parties for Raring and if so when and where?

 19:38:06 <airurando> I would hope we'd host at least one Release Party.

 19:38:22 <airurando> Is there any interest in this?

 19:38:26 <andru183> We host one in UL no prob

 19:38:51 <airurando> nice one andru183

 19:38:53 <andru183> I'm not on the comp soc anymore but the lads will host one for sure

 19:39:12 <airurando> will you take care of that?

 19:39:25 <airurando> getting the details up on the LTP?

 19:39:28 <andru183> can do of course

 19:39:41 <airurando> great stuff

 19:40:03 <airurando> I'd love it if there was a release party also held in Dublin

 19:40:21 <zmoylan> if there were one in dublin how many here would turn up?

 19:40:21 <airurando> I sincerely hope to be able to attend but it will depend on a few things falling into place for me.

 19:40:44 <airurando> zmoylan I'd love to

 19:40:50 <tdr112> I cant am away that time

 19:41:07 <zmoylan> me too but i can't guarantee it either

 19:41:24 <airurando> but it depends on how the leg is doing, my return to work and my return to driving.

 19:41:52 <airurando> Victor9098

 19:42:39 <airurando> Victor9098 would you be interested in being the anchor member for a Dublin Release party.

 19:43:06 <airurando> nothing major.  Just could you guarantee being present for the party

 19:43:46 <airurando> Of all the parties I have attended the two I thought were most fun were 10.10 in the market bar and 11.10 in the Porterhouse in Templebar.

 19:44:07 <airurando> I'd vote for a return to the Porterhouse in Templebar.

 19:44:19 <airurando> Victor9098 would you be interested in being the anchor member for a Dublin Release party.

 19:44:30 <airurando> nothing major.  Just could you guarantee being present for the party

 19:45:10 <airurando> Victor9098 we have no one present at the meeting who can say for certain they will be there

 19:45:40 <airurando> It would be great if you could take the lead on this

 19:45:49 <victor9098> I can't promise anything at the moment, my vehicle is off the road and trying to get a replacement

 19:46:01 <airurando> no problem

 19:46:05 <airurando> hmmmmm

 19:46:51 <airurando> of the people here who might go to a Dublin party would the Porterhouse in Templebar be an acceptable venue?

 19:47:46 <zmoylan> never been there i don't think.  need to find it on map but should be able to reach on crutch

 19:47:54 <victor9098> Looks pretty on Google

 19:48:10 <tdr112> its a nice pub

 19:48:43 <zmoylan> yeah, i can make it there.  http://www.yelp.ie/biz/the-porterhouse-temple-bar-dublin-3

 19:49:05 <airurando> great

 19:49:32 <zmoylan> name a time and date and i'll do my utmost to make it.

 19:49:56 <airurando> I reckon Saturday after the release for Dublin

 19:50:21 <zmoylan> would it be quieter/preferable on a sunday?

 19:51:21 <airurando> would that be more limiting in terms of attendance?

 19:51:44 <victor9098> Should hit up Canonical for a stall and set-up in Temple Bar :-D

 19:51:47 <zmoylan> i'm easy, just pointing out that saturday in temple bar is their busy time

 19:52:03 <airurando> indeed zmoylan

 19:52:06 <zmoylan> a penguin costume handing out disks in front of central bank :-)

 19:52:18 <airurando> i don't know

 19:52:46 <airurando> Saturday night is busy for a reason as it is the night folks like to party

 19:53:32 <airurando> I'm happy to try a Sunday slot

 19:53:45 <airurando> tdr112 would you be around on Sunday evening?

 19:53:57 <tdr112> what date

 19:53:59 <zmoylan> whatever others want i'm happy to go along with.  sunday was just a thought

 19:54:08 <airurando> 28th

 19:54:26 <victor9098> No partying for me, hour drive in and home (if I can get sorted)

 19:54:56 <airurando> victor9098: orange juice?

 19:55:04 <tdr112> sorry flying back from newcaste , i am at maker faire that weekend

 19:55:22 <zmoylan> i'm on public transport for an hour either way.  stone cold sober for that :-D

 19:55:44 <victor9098> :-D Safety first

 19:56:00 <airurando> victor9098: would you prefer a sat or sun party?

 19:56:05 <zmoylan> saturday 27th i have an rpg game that would make it difficult to attend.  standing game for last saturday of month

 19:56:27 <zmoylan> that's why i have missed last few.  :-/

 19:56:28 <airurando> settled so

 19:56:51 <zmoylan> time then?

 19:57:05 <airurando> as you are the MOST likely to attend I reckon it your decision

 19:57:15 <airurando> Sunday at 8pm

 19:57:17 <airurando> ?

 19:57:21 <zmoylan> works for me

 19:57:37 <victor9098> If I can get in I will drop in either/both. Partial to a Sun brew myself, but since I might not even turn up stick with a Sat night party. Might be light on the Ubuntu loaded laptops though

 19:57:38 <airurando> maybe tdr112 could drop in on  his way home from the airport

 19:58:13 <airurando> victor9098: I think Sunday has been decided upon

 19:58:21 <tdr112> :) dont land until 22.30

 19:58:32 <airurando> :-)

 19:58:56 <airurando> zmoylan would an earlier start be more preferable

 19:59:08 <airurando> say 7pm till 10pm?

 19:59:12 <zmoylan> would it make it better for anyone else?

 19:59:55 <airurando> victor9098: would a 7pm till 10pm party suit you better that a party starting at 8pm?

 20:00:23 <victor9098> Early start I reckon, especially for those of use travelling a distance

 20:00:35 <zmoylan> 7-10 it is

 20:00:35 <victor9098> Dinner in Zaytoons beforehand, yummy :-D

 20:00:36 <airurando> I was just thinking an early start early finish party on a Sun would be better

 20:01:16 <airurando> victor9098: single venue for simplicity

 20:02:05 <airurando> can arrange Zaytoons at a later date for pre party munchies. :-)

 20:02:38 <victor9098> Well, if I can make it I will send an email about it before the day

 20:03:14 <airurando> will we just go with the Porterhouse TempleBar from 7pm till 10pm on Sunday 28 Apr 13 so?

 20:03:23 <zmoylan> sounds the easiest
