* happy_tux remembered about an article on Ubuntu in PCLive in December.

Mar 09 21:09:48 *	timnik (n=tim@87-198-41-108.ptr.magnet.ie) has joined #ubuntu-ie
Mar 09 21:09:48 <ebel>	There's a nice little pub next door aswell.
Mar 09 21:10:21 <ebel>	I've put up a wiki page about the party and added that as a proposal.
Mar 09 21:10:37 <RiverrunFree>	sounds good
Mar 09 21:10:45 <ebel>	Does anyone have any other ideas?
Mar 09 21:11:17 <RiverrunFree>	24/04/'08 ?
Mar 09 21:11:17 <happy_tux>	a hotel would be nice....but i dont think thats going to happen...
Mar 09 21:11:26 <ebel>	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/IrishTeam/HardyReleaseParty The wikipage (I relaise now I haven't linked it any other page! :P)
Mar 09 21:12:08 <ebel>	does anyone know any one who works in a hotel or anything?
Mar 09 21:12:13 <happy_tux>	whats the story on getting copies to joe public...is it for just ubuntu enthuasts or can anyone come along ?
Mar 09 21:12:42 <RiverrunFree>	oh it's the 26th
Mar 09 21:12:43 <ebel>	RiverrunFree, yes that's a popular date for the release party on other teams. that's in the wiki page.
Mar 09 21:12:52 <ebel>	happy_tux, copies? Copies of what?
Mar 09 21:13:00 <happy_tux>	if anyone can come along then you would need a comfortable environment
Mar 09 21:13:15 <happy_tux>	cds of hardy heron
Mar 09 21:13:40 <RiverrunFree>	will there be installation discs there, by any chance?
Mar 09 21:13:40 <ebel>	Well I figure we can organise some CDs to be there for the day.
Mar 09 21:13:40 <happy_tux>	the idea is to get new users interested ?
Mar 09 21:13:49 <happy_tux>	yea
Mar 09 21:13:57 <RiverrunFree>	great
Mar 09 21:14:11 <ebel>	I wonder could we get proffesional pressed CDs from Canonical. a la shippit.
Mar 09 21:14:22 <ebel>	Probably not in time for the release party though.
Mar 09 21:14:23 <RiverrunFree>	that will save a lot of work
Mar 09 21:14:40 <happy_tux>	well ill brink a pack of 50 blanks hows that?
Mar 09 21:14:41 <ebel>	Any ubuntu marketing material would be cool too.
Mar 09 21:14:47 <happy_tux>	bring
Mar 09 21:15:13 <RiverrunFree>	it might be best to wait a few weeks anyway before installing
Mar 09 21:15:14 <ebel>	OK well there's lot of nitty gritty details for the release party.
Mar 09 21:15:59 <ebel>	I suggest we pad out that release party wiki page to get organised. What we need (CDs, marketing material, refreshments)
Mar 09 21:16:00 <happy_tux>	i would like to see new users with a slight interest coming along to see it and maybe put a copy on their own system
Mar 09 21:16:16 <happy_tux>	deffo marketing material
Mar 09 21:16:28 <happy_tux>	but you need a location setup
Mar 09 21:16:32 <ebel>	Yes we'll need some sort of game plan for the party. What'll we do, etc.
Mar 09 21:17:13 <ebel>	RiverrunFree, the release party won't be for another month at the earliest, it won't be till *after* hardy is out.
Mar 09 21:17:21 <ebel>	So it won't be beta software.
Mar 09 21:17:36 <RiverrunFree>	yeah, 26th april, right
Mar 09 21:17:52 <happy_tux>	think its a thursday?
Mar 09 21:18:02 <ebel>	happy_tux, 26th is a saturday
Mar 09 21:18:03 <RiverrunFree>	ok
Mar 09 21:18:21 <happy_tux>	ah ok just looking now ;)
Mar 09 21:18:23 <RiverrunFree>	24th the day hh is released
Mar 09 21:18:46 <ebel>	So we'll use that wikipage to start making lists of what we need to have, and what we'll do on the party.
Mar 09 21:18:55 <happy_tux>	yea thats great...couple of days to download install and copy
Mar 09 21:19:25 <ebel>	If I remember from gutsy, it's a pain to download on release day. :)
Mar 09 21:19:36 <RiverrunFree>	looking foreward to hh
Mar 09 21:19:52 <RiverrunFree>	so it is
Mar 09 21:19:57 <happy_tux>	i would prefer a public place where people could come in freely and see whats going on....
Mar 09 21:20:01 <ebel>	But we should be able to burn a bunch of CDs. Get a few people and they'll only have to do maybe a dozen each.
Mar 09 21:20:14 <ebel>	happy_tux, like out in the open? on the street?
Mar 09 21:20:30 <RiverrunFree>	i tried to upgrade the RC a few days b4 hand and it broke feisty
Mar 09 21:20:34 <happy_tux>	camara is perfect, for computer users and the like, but, not sure about joe public accessing the area
Mar 09 21:20:48 <ebel>	happy_tux, yeah, it's not the nicest area. :/
Mar 09 21:20:49 <happy_tux>	no not open
Mar 09 21:21:11 <happy_tux>	a hotel would be ideal i think.?
Mar 09 21:21:33 <ebel>	Yeah that would be nice.
Mar 09 21:21:51 <RiverrunFree>	it would be nice
Mar 09 21:22:03 <ebel>	But you'd have to pay then.
Mar 09 21:22:18 <happy_tux>	just what i was thinking :-(
Mar 09 21:22:35 <ebel>	happy_tux, do you want to investigate that?
Mar 09 21:22:57 <happy_tux>	i will price around a few function rooms yes
Mar 09 21:23:29 <happy_tux>	its all money...grrr
Mar 09 21:24:04 <RiverrunFree>	you wouldn't' need a great big room
Mar 09 21:24:18 <happy_tux>	enough to fit 3 ppl anyway lol
Mar 09 21:24:25 <RiverrunFree>	lol
Mar 09 21:24:53 <happy_tux>	i used to run the amiga user club in the north star hotel
Mar 09 21:24:59 <ebel>	Well like I said, the camara workshop is free. :)
Mar 09 21:25:07 <happy_tux>	ill check it out during the week
Mar 09 21:25:31 <RiverrunFree>	yeah, and it'll be daylight by then
Mar 09 21:25:41 <ebel>	Cool. If someone know someone who worked in a hotel.... 
Mar 09 21:26:33 <happy_tux>	what would a time frame for the day be?   1:00 pm ?
Mar 09 21:26:37 <RiverrunFree>	any enthusiastic linux users in the hotel business?
Mar 09 21:27:02 <ebel>	we should probably look at what other teams are doing.
Mar 09 21:27:13 <ebel>	And deciede what we want to do at the day.
Mar 09 21:27:17 <happy_tux>	aye
Mar 09 21:28:02 <RiverrunFree>	it's a nice idea to have a party
Mar 09 21:28:29 <RiverrunFree>	meet others who use ubuntu
Mar 09 21:29:06 <ebel>	So we need to expand the wiki with things we'll need, and things we could do, and people who are interested in helping out?
Mar 09 21:29:40 <happy_tux>	well put my name down to help out as best i can
Mar 09 21:29:57 <ebel>	somethings we need help with: Finding more venues. Burning CDs. Designing / Finding marketing material for hardy and ubuntu.
Mar 09 21:30:15 <RiverrunFree>	are you expecting many ppl?
Mar 09 21:30:35 <ebel>	RiverrunFree, I dunno. The more the merrier.
Mar 09 21:30:43 <ebel>	We also need to figure out how to market this.
Mar 09 21:30:44 <RiverrunFree>	ok
Mar 09 21:30:47 <happy_tux>	it depends on weather people know about it i suppose ?
Mar 09 21:31:00 <ebel>	We can market the party to a few groups, linux users and non linux users.
Mar 09 21:31:13 <ebel>	Linux users are easy. Mails to ILUG and the like take care of that.
Mar 09 21:31:38 <ebel>	Getting some local press there would be cool. Maybe even write a press release and send to the papers....
Mar 09 21:31:38 <happy_tux>	"The greatest OS in the world comes to Dublin April 26th" !!!
Mar 09 21:31:57 <ebel>	Esp. with vista out recently.
Mar 09 21:32:21 <ebel>	We need to get in contact with people in the Irish press and Irish techy press,
Mar 09 21:33:05 <RiverrunFree>	The Irish Times might be interested
Mar 09 21:33:36 <happy_tux>	yeah PCLive
Mar 09 21:33:57 <ebel>	yep.
Mar 09 21:34:22 <ebel>	We should try to get something mentioned in there before the meeting to get people to come.
Mar 09 21:34:27 <ebel>	Maybe a letters to the editor.
Mar 09 21:34:35 <ebel>	And then something after it to show off. :)
Mar 09 21:34:41 <RiverrunFree>	good idea that
Mar 09 21:35:14 <ebel>	Right, any other thoughts on the hardy party? Or are we done?
Mar 09 21:35:17 <happy_tux>	they did have a ubuntu article recently
Mar 09 21:36:08 <RiverrunFree>	didn't see it
Mar 09 21:36:20 <ebel>	me  neither,
Mar 09 21:36:32 <happy_tux>	yeah december maybe it was
Mar 09 21:36:33 <ebel>	If we could contact the author of that, that'd be cool.

Mar 09 21:37:46 <ebel>	Cool! :)
Mar 09 21:37:52 <ebel>	They might have an online archive or something.
Mar 09 21:38:01 <ebel>	OK, anything else?
Mar 09 21:38:10 <ebel>	We've got a lot of stuff here for the release party.
Mar 09 21:38:30 <ebel>	Lots to keep us busy.
Mar 09 21:38:54 <happy_tux>	busier!
Mar 09 21:39:04 <ebel>	True that. :)
Mar 09 21:39:23 <ebel>	OK, next item on the agenda was added by me.
Mar 09 21:39:39 <ebel>	System76 gives people free 'powered by ubuntu' stickers for their laptops.
Mar 09 21:39:48 <RiverrunFree>	stickers
Mar 09 21:39:48 <ebel>	You can get them in a few countries, but not ireland.
Mar 09 21:39:57 <ebel>	yet. :)
Mar 09 21:40:17 <ebel>	I've emailed press@system76 about a week ago but they haven't gotten back to me.
Mar 09 21:40:28 <ebel>	I'm willing to help with getting that started.
Mar 09 21:40:56 <ebel>	I think I'll just have to bug them more.
Mar 09 21:41:13 <ebel>	And find out how other countries / loco teams got that stated.
Mar 09 21:41:15 <ebel>	*started
Mar 09 21:42:14 <happy_tux>	so we want ireland to be put on the list of free stickers option?

Mar 09 21:42:48 <ebel>	well someone in ireland will have to put stickers in envelopes. :)
Mar 09 21:42:56 <ebel>	(I think)
Mar 09 21:43:04 <ebel>	I'm willing to do that to get it started.
Mar 09 21:43:35 <md5ie>	Hi everyone, nice to see that there are more people using Ubuntu in Ireland

Mar 09 21:44:12 <ebel>	We're talking about getting some free 'powered by ubuntu' stickers.
Mar 09 21:44:37 <ebel>	they'd go well at the hardy party too.
Mar 09 21:44:38 <md5ie>	that shouldn't be a problem
Mar 09 21:44:50 <md5ie>	When is the meeting?
Mar 09 21:44:53 <happy_tux>	so system 76 sends you a load of free stickers and you post them to anyone who wants them ?
Mar 09 21:45:12 <ebel>	happy_tux, yep. they send you 4 for ech self address envelope.
Mar 09 21:45:26 <ebel>	I got some from the UK, but I had to get my sister to send me some UK stamps.
Mar 09 21:45:30 <ebel>	not very practical.
Mar 09 21:45:30 <md5ie>	i have around 20 (I think) :)

Mar 09 21:46:32 <md5ie>	Oh I was thinking about the real meeting :)
Mar 09 21:46:45 <ebel>	well I /think/ system76 send the person a whole bunch and then they dole them out in 4s.
Mar 09 21:46:58 <RiverrunFree>	it's the 26th april
Mar 09 21:47:04 <ebel>	They are available in about 20 countries so far.
Mar 09 21:47:06 <happy_tux>	ill email them
Mar 09 21:47:16 <md5ie>	Could you tell me more about your team? What are your plans?
Mar 09 21:47:19 <ebel>	http://system76.com/article_info.php?articles_id=9
Mar 09 21:47:49 <ebel>	happy_tux, yeah the more ubuntu-ie people ask them the more likely they are to do it. :)
Mar 09 21:48:27 <happy_tux>	ebel:  that is a great idea!
Mar 09 21:48:46 <RiverrunFree>	yeah, I could email them and ask them to add irl
Mar 09 21:48:49 <happy_tux>	im on it
Mar 09 21:48:56 <ebel>	Cool. :)
Mar 09 21:49:05 <RiverrunFree>	I'll do that!
Mar 09 21:49:08 <ebel>	I've emailed press@system76.com already, no reply yet.
Mar 09 21:49:12 <happy_tux>	god ill need to write all these tasks down :-/
Mar 09 21:49:37 <ebel>	We should contact the other ubuntu loco teams that've done it. find out what's involved.
Mar 09 21:50:13 <happy_tux>	ones closest to home would be a good start
Mar 09 21:50:24 <ebel>	Yep. UK.
Mar 09 21:50:46 <ebel>	Right so basically we need to just keep bugging them and find out what's involved?
Mar 09 21:51:35 <ebel>	Any other thoughts on that topic?
Mar 09 21:52:53 <ebel>	OK, next. :)
Mar 09 21:53:11 <happy_tux>	have you seen the graphic stickers i did
Mar 09 21:53:13 <happy_tux>	?
Mar 09 21:53:22 <RiverrunFree>	Think so
Mar 09 21:53:40 <ebel>	happy_tux, I saw the graphics. Are there specific sticker versions?
Mar 09 21:53:42 <RiverrunFree>	You posted them on the site, right?
Mar 09 21:53:50 <happy_tux>	no
Mar 09 21:53:55 <happy_tux>	yea
Mar 09 21:54:00 <RiverrunFree>	They look good
Mar 09 21:54:31 <happy_tux>	cheers....its getting them into actual sticker format that is the stopping point :-)
Mar 09 21:54:47 <RiverrunFree>	That's the problem
Mar 09 21:54:54 <ebel>	Lots of places do printing. Reads would be good.
Mar 09 21:55:19 <ebel>	I /assume/ they do stickers, they do everything else. :)
Mar 09 21:55:25 <RiverrunFree>	Reads would be a good place to try
Mar 09 21:56:01 <happy_tux>	k
Mar 09 21:56:53 <ebel>	cool.
Mar 09 21:57:06 <ebel>	twould be cooler to get free ones though. :)
Mar 09 21:57:29 <RiverrunFree>	would system 76 help out with that, i wonder?
Mar 09 21:58:07 <ebel>	I think so... But I'm not sure! They haven't replied. :(
Mar 09 21:58:14 <RiverrunFree>	ok
Mar 09 21:58:15 <ebel>	That's why we gotta bug em! :)
Mar 09 21:58:29 <RiverrunFree>	I'll drop them a line
Mar 09 21:58:57 <ebel>	Cool. :)
Mar 09 21:59:19 <RiverrunFree>	:)
Mar 09 21:59:25 <ebel>	OK, anything else?
Mar 09 21:59:36 *	md5ie is now known as md5-
Mar 09 22:00:15 <ebel>	Right. Next item on the agenda
Mar 09 22:00:18 <md5->	the website looks quite bad :) you need one like latvians has
Mar 09 22:00:55 <ebel>	md5-, yeah it is. Mean-Machine needs to get the codes off someone for that.
Mar 09 22:01:23 <md5->	is there anyone who can create a website from nothing?
Mar 09 22:01:54 <ebel>	Well we need the codes for the ubuntu-ie.org domain and hosting. 
Mar 09 22:02:24 <md5->	allright
Mar 09 22:02:53 <md5->	how many people do you have in your team?
Mar 09 22:03:23 <ebel>	md5-, there are 48 active members on launchpad. https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-ie
Mar 09 22:03:35 <ebel>	Not all of them are here today. :)
Mar 09 22:03:57 <ebel>	OK stop me if I'm going too fast, I'm just trying to get through this, it's 10pm now!
Mar 09 22:04:20 <ebel>	But next on the agenda is getting stupid am/pm to work on the irish locale.
Mar 09 22:04:23 <RiverrunFree>	Wow, didn't know about the launchpad site
Mar 09 22:04:37 <ebel>	Something relevant to the irish ubuntu community I'm sure. :)
Mar 09 22:04:56 <ebel>	There's some details here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=718768
Mar 09 22:05:15 <ebel>	Please vote for this idea on the ubuntu brainstorm: http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/idea/3904/
Mar 09 22:05:28 <RiverrunFree>	I tried the patch half an hour ago
Mar 09 22:05:36 <RiverrunFree>	didn't work
Mar 09 22:05:53 <ebel>	:( Did you try to patch the code, or use the custom package?
Mar 09 22:06:20 <RiverrunFree>	the string
Mar 09 22:06:38 <ebel>	If you want the 12 hour clock option to show up, you need to restart gnome, or at worse restart your PC.
Mar 09 22:06:43 <md5->	do you need any help in creating your team?
Mar 09 22:06:49 <RiverrunFree>	ok
Mar 09 22:07:29 <ebel>	RiverrunFree, but if you apply the patch and do "date '+%r'" from the command line you can see if it worked right away.
Mar 09 22:07:34 <RiverrunFree>	ctrl+alt +/
Mar 09 22:07:43 <ebel>	md5-, everyone who's interested in ubuntu in ireland is welcome.
Mar 09 22:08:00 <RiverrunFree>	i'll give it a go
Mar 09 22:08:02 <md5->	I am lithuanian but living in Ireland for 4 years
Mar 09 22:08:12 <md5->	so I guess I should join irish team :)
Mar 09 22:08:17 <ebel>	Cool! Great to see you here!
Mar 09 22:08:33 <md5->	thanks :)
Mar 09 22:08:43 <RiverrunFree>	do i need to use gedit to create a file in etc?
Mar 09 22:08:56 <happy_tux>	ok voted on brainstorm
Mar 09 22:09:01 <ebel>	Everyone should join the lauchpad team try to show their support.
Mar 09 22:09:05 <RiverrunFree>	Welcome, md5
Mar 09 22:09:16 <md5->	hey :)
Mar 09 22:09:33 <ebel>	RiverrunFree, probably the easiest way to do it is to use the custom package. the forum thread explains how to do it
Mar 09 22:09:50 <RiverrunFree>	I'm a member in Launchpad, but I didn't know abt the irl group
Mar 09 22:09:55 <RiverrunFree>	until now
Mar 09 22:10:03 <RiverrunFree>	ok
Mar 09 22:10:17 <RiverrunFree>	i'll look again
Mar 09 22:10:36 <ebel>	I don't really know how to get this change into the main ubuntu package. I've created a bug report https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/langpack-locales/+bug/199899 and I suppose we keep bugging them about it.
Mar 09 22:11:05 <RiverrunFree>	hmm,
Mar 09 22:11:12 <md5->	Well the great thing is when you open an ireland group you can get free cds of new realeases before everyone else
Mar 09 22:11:18 <RiverrunFree>	i get: deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/rorymcc/ubuntu gutsy main
Mar 09 22:11:18 <RiverrunFree>	deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/rorymcc/ubuntu gutsy main
Mar 09 22:11:30 <RiverrunFree>	no patch
Mar 09 22:12:04 <ebel>	RiverrunFree, OK, you need to create a file called /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rorymcc-ppa.list with that as the contents
Mar 09 22:12:21 <RiverrunFree>	great thanks
Mar 09 22:12:22 <ebel>	Then just do a normal software update and the patched version will be downloaded and installed.
Mar 09 22:12:35 <ebel>	md5-, really? free cds? Cool.
Mar 09 22:12:35 <RiverrunFree>	didn't know what to call it
Mar 09 22:12:44 <md5->	original ones
Mar 09 22:12:45 <ebel>	can you tell us more about that?
Mar 09 22:13:04 <md5->	Well the main thing is to make the Ubuntu popular in ireland
Mar 09 22:13:10 <ebel>	RiverrunFree, if you do the command: "sudo wget -O /etc/apt/source.list.d/rorymcc-ppa.list http://technomancy.org/ubuntu/rorymcc-ppa.list" it should takecare of everything

Mar 09 22:13:32 <md5->	and after we would come official team of ireland
Mar 09 22:14:03 <ebel>	md5-, are you involved withthe lithuanian team?
