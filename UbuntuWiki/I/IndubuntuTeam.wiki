== Introduction ==

This Team works on making the Ind''''''Ubuntu dream come true.

The main tasks of this Team are:
* Federate all Ubuntu and upstream forces interested in the subject and create a Development Community.
* Sum up the state of Ind''''''Ubuntu artwork.
* Specify the functions and the look & feel of the Ind''''''Ubuntu distribution for better accessibility
* Create the needed resources (graphical and textual components) and plugins.
* Package and maintain everything needed for an Ind''''''Ubuntu.
* Create a specific distribution for Ind''''''Ubuntu installation.
* Maintain and improve the results.
* Work closely with upstreams.

The Indubuntu will be both suited for desktop usage and operation as a dedicated appliance.
