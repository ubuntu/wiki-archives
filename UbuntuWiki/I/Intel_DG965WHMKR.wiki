__TOC__

I have tested this motherboard with Edgy 6.10 (amd64) and Feisty (7.04) and a Core 2 Duo CPU. It mostly works, except:

1. The Marvell PATA driver is not found by the kernel on the installation disc. This makes it impossible to install from an PATA (IDE) CD. SATA CD drives are OK.

2. Edgy: The boot-splashed 'Ubuntu' logo's geometry is messed up and appears in black and white. This is common to many 64-bit machines. See <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/usplash-theme-ubuntu/+bug/67545|Bug #67545]]</nowiki>. (Fixed in Feisty.)

3. The X.Org i810 driver is found automatically and generally works. If you switch from X to a console and then back again, you may get a blank screen and have to reboot. In Feisty and later, this can be fixed by using the newer driver (xserver-xorg-video-intel instead of xserver-xorg-video-i810). This is available in Feisty (universe) and Gutsy (main).

4. If using a DVI-D interface (with an ADD2 card) the image appears somewhat blurred when using the i810 driver. This can be fixed with the newer driver as in (3) above.
