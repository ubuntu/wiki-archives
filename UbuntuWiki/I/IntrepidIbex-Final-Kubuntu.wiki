(This is a draft)
The Kubuntu developers have been hard at work, bringing you the latest and greatest software the open source community has to offer. This Kubuntu 8.10 , which brings a host of excellent new features, and a whole new KDE4 desktop.

This Intrepid release lives up to its name by including many changes, but there are some features that are not yet available in KDE4.  If you would rather stay with what you know, Kubuntu 8.04 is still fully supported, see <nowiki>[[Kubuntu-KDE3-KDE4Migration]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[http://techbase.kde.org/Schedules/Is_KDE_4.1_for_you%3F|Is KDE 4.1 for you?]]</nowiki> for more information on deciding.  You can try it first with the Kubuntu Intrepid Live CD and see.

== Upgrading from 8.04 ==
To upgrade from Kubuntu 8.04, press Alt+F2 and type in ''' kdesudo "adept_manager --dist-upgrade-devel" ''' (including quotes) into the command box. Adept should open up and offer a Version Upgrade button. Click Version Upgrade and follow the on-screen instructions.

By default, our Plasma desktop has a customized offering of widgets, bringing the best configurations that our KDE3 desktop had back to KDE4, along with some new additions such as the QuickAccess plasmoid in the panel which provides quick access to the files in your home directory.

Taskmanager tooltips have also been backported from KDE trunk.

In KDE4 KWin has been given the bling-bling with shiny new Desktop effects ranging from the standard shadows and translucency to Wobbly Windows to a Coverswitch alt-tab switcher. These effects will be on by default if your video card supports them.

Dedicated file manager<<BR>>

Dolphin gets a breath of fresh air in KDE4, with numerous new features, a load of bugfixes, and those tiny polishing details that make Dolphin a very capable file manager. As in past releases, Konqueror is still available for file browsing if you prefer it.

=== Adept 3.0 ===

Adept 3.0 brings a fresh KDE4 interface that is much more stable, nimble and easy on system resources

All the essential Kubuntu tools have been given greater integration with KDE4 with ports to to PyKDE4:
* GDebiKDE, the Kubuntu .deb installation frontend.

* Language Selector, the Kubuntu language selection and setup tool
* Software-properties-kde, the apt sources.list editor for Adept
* Printer Applet, shows what is currently printing
* system-config-printer-kde, the Kubuntu/KDE printer setup tool
* laptop volume key integration
* Guidance Power Manager
* Apport, crash manager now integrated by default

== Known Issues ==
There are several known bugs that users may run into with Kubuntu 8.10 RC. We have documented them here for your convenience along with any known workarounds.
* Icons can get messed up from KDE3 upgrades where the user manually set the icon theme once upon a time, workaround is to set the Oxygen theme explicitly from System Settings https://launchpad.net/bugs/289174
* KNetworkManager does not recognize static IP connections at this time. This issue only occurs for some, and not all. https://launchpad.net/bugs/280762
* External monitors on a laptop blink on and off. This issue only occurs for some, and not all.  This blog post describes a workaround http://blog.nixternal.com/2008.10.22/kubuntu-intrepid-dual-monitor-blinking/  https://launchpad.net/bugs/278471
* Bluetooth is currently broken for Kubuntu Intrepid due to a last minute upgrade of the bluez stack.  We hope to have a fix for this but only as an update after release, 2008. https://launchpad.net/bugs/280997
