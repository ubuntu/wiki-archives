__TOC__

Excellent board, Hardy 64-bit Beta installed flawlessly. Network, sound, USB, onboard video all working ok. Firewire not tested. SATA hard drive, with an IDE DVD-RW (board only has a single IDE anyway, so IDE HDs not tested). 

Suspend and hibernate both working ok. No boot options required.
