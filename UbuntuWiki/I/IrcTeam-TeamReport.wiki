Welcome to the IrcTeam reporting page. Every month this page should be filled with bullet points indicating the summary of some of the work the IrcTeam has been doing.

=== The Report ===

* Preventing fake loco channels
** Seveas will codify (on the wiki) the discussion we had about this as a naming policy.
** We will continue to handle these cases in a case-by-case manner and use this policy to point people at.
* Cloaks
** We discussed policies for bot cloaks. Seveas will codify it as a policy on the wiki.
* Both policies above are up for discussion on the ubuntu-irc list when the first draft is finished.
* Launchpad teams were shifted around, with a new ubuntu-irc-council team being set as owner for ubuntu-irc and ubuntu-irc-cloaks
* Now that the council has been approved, Seveas is replacing all references to himself on the wiki with the Council where appropriate.
