__TOC__

Kubuntu user for about 2 years.

I am currently working as senior Java developer at Willevolve d.o.o. where I do this:

-database design

-middle tier design and implementation (EJB, Spring framework, hibernate, JSP , Servlets, Tomcat etc...)

-client side web programming (HTML, CSS, javascript.. )

-standalone java application design and implementation (mostly SWING)

at my spare time I 'm working on various projects. One of them is www.klopa.hr web site (food portal) where I did all programming and html/css stuff.

I have some experience in 3D programming. I wrote my little 3D engine using java and jogl (Java- Open GL bridge).

I did lots off java network programming (TCP/IP sockets, IO Streams... etc).
