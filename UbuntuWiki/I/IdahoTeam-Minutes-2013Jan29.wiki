Topic(s):	Install & Configure Ubuntu Server

We decided to have a few meetings that focus on a server theme, so we spent the first meeting of the series focusing on a base server install. Curt walked us through a base installation and configuration of Ubuntu Server 12.04. Included discussion on tasksel and various configuration options to prep for various server roles and security.
