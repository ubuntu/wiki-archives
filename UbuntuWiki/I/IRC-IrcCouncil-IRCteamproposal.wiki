=== Factoid Review ===

It has been suggested that some of the ubottu <nowiki>[[http://ubottu.com/factoids.cgi|factoids]]</nowiki> are not very "friendly". 
Some need to be edited,updated, and some disabled entirely.
Work on this has been started at <nowiki>[[http://pad.ubuntu.com/factoids|Review Pad]]</nowiki>
=== Alignment of launchpad and channel access lists ===

we use Launchpad teams to manage the process of applying for ops, but access is defined in channel access lists which are not tied automatically to launchpad
 https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ankl5FhsdSiZdGZVV2ZuLVRwa2c5M3pqX3BEaUhXMFE
we need to do some maintenance to get these aligned one way or another and then have a semi-automatic process going forward to nudge things back into alignment as things change.
