'''Directions to set up an internet proxy server for v. 8.0.4:''' 

'''Description:''' 
Theses are instructions to setup and administer a Squid Proxy Server
'''Procedure:'''
* Installation of Proxy Server
** Install Squid using apt
** apt-get install squid squid common
** At this stage Squid is already running
** Edit the Squid Configuration File for our needs
** Add the following lines
*** http_port 3128 transparent
*** This sets the port number squid listens for http requests, it will also make squid a transparent proxy in the same step :)
*** acl our_networks src 192.168.1.0/24
*** adds the name our_networks to the acl with the value of 192.168.1.0/24
*** http_access allow our_networks
*** Uses the created acl our_networks to allow http_access to the internal network
*** cache_dir ufs /var/spool/squid 5000 16 256
*** This option increases the size of the cache to 5 GB (This may have to be raised.  We need monitoring instructions so we can determine usage once the server is in use.)  

* Todo
** Direct all http traffic through the proxy using iptables (Will need to be done when this can be tested
** iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.1.1:3128
** iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth1 -p tcp -m tcp –dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 3128
** Setup authentication and filtering based on group policy in ManageGroups
