== Introduction ==
Intrepid Ibex is the codename for Kubuntu 8.10, due to be released October 30 2008.

The focus for 8.10 for the Kubuntu community will be transitioning to a KDE 4 desktop. The plan is to integrate our existing Kubuntu software while at the same time offering the best out-of-the-box KDE 4 experience around. Intrepid Ibex is a whole new revolution for us, Intrepidly going where no Kubuntu release has gone before.

'''NOTE:''' ''This is a beta release. Pre-release versions of Intrepid are '''NOT''' encouraged for anyone needing a stable system or for anyone who is not comfortable running into occasional, even frequent, breakage. Pre-release versions of Intrepid '''ARE''' recommended for Kubuntu developers and those who want to help in testing, reporting, and fixing bugs.''
