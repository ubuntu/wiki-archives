I started out using Ubuntu a few years ago. Then for 3 years i switched to Gentoo. It taught me a lot about Linux but eventually i tired of it. So having always had a positive experience with Ubuntu I switched back. One thing i really love about Ubuntu is the ever helpful community. Ubuntuforums has saved my bacon a number of times. it is just a great place to ask questions. So in the end it really was the community that drew me back to Ubuntu.

I really like the local team concept Ubuntu has and am proud to be a member of the Iowa Team.
