=== Meetings ===
Considering the geographical spread of India, online meetings on the irc channel is the primary way collaborating among the team.

Meetings are usually held every first friday of the month at 9 pm IST in the #ubuntu-in channel on the Freenode IRC network. An email reminder is sent to the mailing list atleast 3 days prior to the meeting.

==== How to Chair Meetings ====
Indian Team uses '''''meetingology''''' ircbot for recording the minutes of the meeting, counting votes, action items etc. Person chairing these meetings is requested to read <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NorthCarolinaTeam/Mootbot-UKHowTo | this how-to]]</nowiki> to get acquainted with various commands involved in operating this ircbot.
