| ''I'm not sure I like this one, so I might have a second go at it. For once, I think the mascot looks "icy." It looks like some of the detail is lost at 48px across, but that's easy to fix. -- K.Mandla''

| ''I like K.Mandla's one a lot! It's true that in small sizes it loses detail, but thickening lines can help there. Here is my first try, taking as base K. Mandla's icon and making lines thicker and darker. As usual, in the three sizes, 117x117 48x48 and 17x17''

| Ok, this is mi final concept. I think the green are the future comunication-programs color.
|-
| I like the icon on the right!  It conveys nicely the feel of the all-in-one application.  It would be a great choice if we have to stop using the SeaMonkey logo.  However, I don't like the idea of a single color for all "communication" programs.  It would be so boring!

=== Misc Ideas ===
* I can't help thinking that a polar bear belongs in these Ice* theme icons somewhere.  Maybe I just can't help but think of the Coca-Cola bears.  :-)
* What's wrong with SeaMonkey? Are they doing the same thing as Mozilla? Has anyone tried to talk to them ''nicely''? The SeaMonkey logo itself is a result of am open contest. Do we really need to replace it? ''-- I'm not sure. I do know the Gnuzilla folks asked for all three icons, so I'm assuming there's something about the SeaMonkey package that transgresses the GNU guidelines. I'm guessing there might be proprietary stuff in there, or perhaps their logo is likewise nonredistributable, even if it was created via contest. This might be a question for the Gnuzilla guys.
