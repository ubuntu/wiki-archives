=== amjjawad's suggestion ===

Focus on these channels only and ignore the rest:

'''As for the other channels''', unless some people step in and offer their help, we can't keep maintaining it. NO, we will NOT kill any channel but for this cycle (6 months) until we release Lubuntu 14.04 LTS, we will have no time to run after or maintain all the channels listed on Ibere's list. That is why, I suggested to focus on the main channels - 4 channels. It is TIME now for the Community (Members and Users of Lubuntu) to take over some tasks and responsibilities.
