=== Summary ===

The aim of this spec is to discuss how we can use the location and language of the user (gathered in the installer) to inform them of their local LoCo team and other relevant resources.

This spec is also intended to discuss the validity of users opting in to be counted so we can get an idea of usage - this would be via a button in the installer.

=== Release Note ===

Locale and language settings are now used to optimise users connection to relevant resources.

=== Rationale ===

It would allow us to:
* Encourage people to be involved in Ubuntu GNU/Linux
* Supply users with the most relevant resources available
* Support region, country and language specific resources by pointing users to them

=== Use Cases ===

* Søren lives in Denmark and has heard about Ubuntu but doesn't understand much english. He has a friend who knows a bit about computers who installs Ubuntu for him in Danish. The system now works but when Søren tries to get some help with how to use Evolution he discovers that all the system documentation is in english, the websites linked to are in english, everything is english.

=== Assumptions ===

* Users are interested in more specific resources
* Ubuntu will allow an allow/disallow box to be added to the installer
* That language and locale specific changes are practical at the level of software code.
* That the changes would not take a significant amount of CD space

=== Design ===

You can have subsections that better describe specific parts of the issue.

=== Implementation ===

==== UI Changes ====

* The installer would need an opt-in button with a short text
* Some applications would need to be modified, for example system documentation and the firefox start page(s) and bookmarks

==== Code Changes ====

Some new code would be needed to collect the data and trigger the use of specific settings.

==== Migration ====

No need for migration.

=== Test/Demo Plan ===

It's important that we are able to test new features, and demonstrate them to users.  Use this section to describe a short plan that anybody can follow that demonstrates the feature is working.  This can then be used during CD testing, and to show off after release.

This need not be added or completed until the specification is nearing beta.

=== Outstanding Issues ===

This spec seems to be going unnoticed.

=== BoF agenda and discussion ===

* Menu item for "Local Community Support"
* Detect location from values entered during installation
* Allow overriding (people tend to move to different places :))
* Include LUGs (on an opt-in basis)
* Firefox Plugin that sets local community resources
* List services provided by LoCos / LUGs
* Stuff browser bookmarks full of links to appropriate resources, and also the non-local ones
* Big list by geographic region, showing countries, languages spoken
* No one reads the "Welcome to Ubuntu" firefox page, so not worth linking there.
* During installation have a "slideshow" (like the windows install does)
** Make the Ubiquity percentage bar window bigger, with a bitmap/text area like windows installs ;)
** "Here's where you get support"
** "Here's how you can contribute to Ubuntu" 
* Shipit - tuck in your business card into the CD sleeves before you give them away.

==== Typical resources linked to ====

* Home page of LoCo / LUG
* Mailing list
* Forums
* IRC channels
* Meeting dates / times / locations
* Launchpad Answers
* Phone number of the LoCo contact :)
* Support groups
* Mailing lists
* LoCo Teams  (approved vs non-approved)
 
==== Comments ====

One can organize simple lookup database to map user browser settings (locale) to LoCo Team and suggest user to go Ubuntu LoCo Team site right at ubuntu.com front page. This will work even for non-ubuntu users and help to find on-line resources before trying ubuntu, which is important in some cases and will help to make decision to switch from other OS. -- -- Agafonov
