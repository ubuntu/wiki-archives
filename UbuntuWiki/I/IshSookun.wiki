=== Future Goals ===
I want to become an Ubuntu Member in order to get more involved with the promotion of Ubuntu Mauritius; LoCo Team I started in order to gather local Ubuntu fans under one roof. The aim of the LoCo Team is channel the various ways through which Mauritians could contribute to make Ubuntu better.

In the near future, we have planned several activities with the University of Mauritius and the University of Technology (UTM/M)auritius) to conduct sessions teaching people about bug reporting, tutorial writing etc.

On 12 September 2014, we are organizing Ubuntu Global Jam on the campus of the University of Mauritius.
