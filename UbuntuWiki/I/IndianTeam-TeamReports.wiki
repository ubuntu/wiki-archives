== IndianTeam Reporting Page ==

Welcome to the Indian Team reporting page. Every month this page should be filled with bullet points indicating the summary of the work carried on by the <nowiki>[[IndianTeam | Indian LoCo]]</nowiki> members. As you work on something, try to summarise it at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/IndianTeam/TeamReports/11/<CurrentMonth> (for example https://wiki.ubuntu.com/IndianTeam/TeamReports/11/January). A few guidelines for how to write good points here:

* Keep it simple and short - single sentences are best. :)
* Try to summarize your work and not be over-detailed - we don't need to know specifics, just a summary of the kind of work involved
* Where possible, include relevant links.
