== The Indiana Ubuntu Local Community Team ==

=== Introduction ===

The Indiana Ubuntu Local Community Team is a group of Ubuntu users and enthusiasts from around the state of Indiana that are here to help each other learn the many ropes of Ubuntu. We are a great place for newcomers to seek help and education.

We also work to advocate free and open source solutions where possible, especially Ubuntu.

=== Join Us! ===

If you're in Indiana, and you use or are interested in using Ubuntu, we want you!

<nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-us-in|Join our mailing list]]</nowiki> and/or <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=213|head on over to our forum]]</nowiki>. If you're into real-time chatting, you can find us in #ubuntu-us-in on irc.freenode.net. If you've got a launchpad account, you might as well <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-us-indiana|join our launchpad team]]</nowiki>!

We are a brand new community, and we need you. If we're going to build a lively community, we're going to need people! We need you to help us be more than just the sum of our online resources.

And we need you to help us define what we direction we'll be going.

We ask that you follow the very common sense <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/community/conduct|Ubuntu Code of Conduct]]</nowiki> when interacting in our community as in any Ubuntu community. You may find that following it in all situations is a pretty good idea, too :-).
