'''Launchpad Entry:''' <nowiki>[[https://blueprints.edge.launchpad.net/bantrackertwo/+spec/launchpad-team-integration|launchpad-team-integration]]</nowiki>

=== Summary ===
A user's launchpad team membership should drive what Bantracker permissions they have.

=== Rationale ===
Removing the need for maintaining a user's group membership within the bantracker will make BT admin's jobs much easier.

=== Design ===
We will map a user's LP team membership against a defined list of IRC relevant groups within the bantracker. These groups will in turn be assigned specific permissions as decided by the IRC Council.

=== Implementation ===
Using <nowiki>[[https://blueprints.edge.launchpad.net/bantrackertwo/+spec/openid-auth|OpenID]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[https://edge.launchpad.net/django-openid-auth|django-openid-auth]]</nowiki> we can enable the OPENID_LAUNCHPAD_TEAMS_MAPPING setting and create the aforementioned groups.
