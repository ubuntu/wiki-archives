[14:10:22] <airurando> [TOPIC] Review of previous action items
[14:10:30] <airurando> OK
[14:11:05] <airurando> from the August meeting we carried over a couple of Actions
[14:11:32] <airurando> firstly, ebel was to give shauno access to blacknight account
[14:11:58] <airurando> secondly, shauno was to update the website
[14:12:36] <fagan> present
[14:12:38] <airurando> at the sept meeting tdr112 indicated that shauno had done some work on the website
[14:12:58] <airurando> just wondering if there is any update on this
[14:13:31] <tdr112> yep he talked on irc about it
[14:13:53] <airurando> tdr112: can you give a brief update
[14:14:06] <airurando> I didn't see
[14:14:39] <tdr112> no i cant all i know is work was beening done
[14:14:50] <airurando> fair enough
[14:15:15] <airurando> we will leave that one so.
[14:15:20] <ebel> ah
[14:15:24] <ebel> haven't done that :P
[14:15:32] <ebel> sorry got busy
[14:15:51] <airurando> no bother ebel
[14:15:57] <mokmeister> just for clarification, the website being ubuntu-ie.org?
[14:16:22] <airurando> apologies mokmeister. That is correct.
[14:16:22] <ebel> haven't seen shauno for a while...
[14:16:43] <tdr112> can someone email him/her about it
[14:17:59] <airurando> any takers?
[14:18:35] <ebel> i'm not sure how much work shauno is doing on it
[14:18:57] <ebel> doing much work on it at the moment
[14:21:40] <airurando> does anyone know shauno?
[14:22:36] <lau1> not me
[14:22:54] <mokmeister> fraid not
[14:23:14] <ebel> nope, just from here
[14:23:22] <airurando> alright so we can leave that on the back burner
[14:24:10] <airurando> ebel could you set up access for shauno on blacknight?
[14:24:53] <airurando> We'll move on to a brief review of the action items from last month.
[14:25:16] <ebel> airurando: ok
[14:25:27] <airurando> ebel: great stuff.
[14:25:51] <airurando> Last month I was actioned to seek input from mailing list on ideas relating to a centralised online presence for LoCo event photos.
[14:26:31] <lau1> well I put mine on the pix.ie for the release party
[14:26:39] <imgarysmith> airurando I had an idea for that but I don't know if it can be made automated
[14:26:45] <airurando> I did this and will discuss outcome as part of a later agenda item
[14:27:08] <airurando> imgarysmith: we'll be discussing this in more detail shortly.
[14:27:22] <imgarysmith> airurando no prob
[14:28:00] <airurando> tdr112 was actioned to email the ubuntu-ie mailing list re pub quiz prizes for the 10.10 release party
[14:28:18] <airurando> tdr112: outcome?
[14:28:43] <lau1> I did not win my bottle of wine ;)
[14:28:44] <tdr112> done , and thank you to everyone who gave stuff for the quiz
[14:29:09] <tdr112> well done to ebel on winning
[14:29:44] <airurando> and that brings us on nicely to the last action item from last month
[14:29:51] <airurando> well done ebel.
[14:30:00] <tdr112> for the questions from the quiz http://www.redbrick.dcu.ie/~tdr/blog/?p=39
[14:30:20] <airurando> tdr112 and airurando were to come up with 20 Qs for the pub quiz.
[14:30:36] <airurando> done but only 10 made it on the day
[14:30:54] <airurando> see blog post from tdr112
[14:31:09] <airurando> [LINK] http://www.redbrick.dcu.ie/~tdr/blog/?p=39
[14:31:38] <airurando> all I can say is that I apologise again for the difficult questions....
[14:31:48] <airurando> On to agenda items proper
[14:32:06] <tdr112> and sorry for forgetting mine
[14:32:32] <airurando> [TOPIC] Update: Should we centralise the storage of our event photos?
[14:33:08] <airurando> so as I said I sent the e-mail requestion thoughts and views
[14:33:18] <airurando> got no response
[14:33:50] <airurando> I know czajkowski has kindly set up a pix.ie account which some folks have started using (release party photos and july geeknic photos!)
[14:34:15] <lau1> I pushed stuff on the pix.ie site for the release party (it's a point to start )
[14:34:27] <tdr112> if no one had other ideas or suggestions i am happy to go with pix.ie
[14:34:47] <lau1> I think it is fine
[14:35:09] <airurando> [LINK] http://pix.ie/ubuntuie
[14:35:31] <airurando> imgarysmith: what are your thoughts?
[14:36:55] <airurando> I am also happy to use pix.ie but I have a small concern about the copyright
[14:36:56] <imgarysmith> i think thats grand, i was just looking at the site and its a great way to do it
[14:37:24] <airurando> on viewing each picture there is a footnote:
[14:37:28] <airurando> This photo is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
[14:37:50] <airurando> I'm wondering who holds the copyright?
[14:38:15] <imgarysmith> im guessing the person who uploaded it
[14:38:23] <lau1> the photograph normally
[14:38:44] <airurando> lau1 photographer?
[14:38:54] <lau1> amateur
[14:39:33] <lau1> unless you licence it with cc all this as a copyright (cc is a form of copyright)
[14:40:01] <lau1> iyes meant photgrapher
[14:40:07] <airurando> I'd be happier with cc
[14:40:34] <ebel> airurando: cc is copyrighted
[14:40:39] <airurando> but listen if copyright remains with those who took the photos them thats fine by me.
[14:40:40] <ebel> all creative works are copyrighted
[14:40:53] * fagan dabbles a bit too
[14:40:54] <ebel> technically linux is copyrighted. it's gpled :P
[14:41:05] <lau1> voilà
[14:41:06] <airurando> I thought cc was creative commons?
[14:41:18] <fagan> it is airurando
[14:41:23] <airurando> clearly I haven't got a clue.
[14:41:25] <ebel> airurando: cc is creative commons and it is copyrighted
[14:41:26] <lau1> yes but there are many type of cc
[14:41:29] <airurando> sorry guys
[14:41:50] <airurando> if everyone is happy with both the concept of centralisation and using pix.ie then I think thats great.
[14:41:58] <fagan> yeah thats cool
[14:41:59] <airurando> any objections?
[14:42:02] <lau1> no worries it's a jungle out there
[14:42:03] <ebel> however you can still be copyrighted and allowed to do stuff
[14:42:09] <lau1> agreed
[14:42:15] <ebel> like a public park, owned by someone, but available for everyone
[14:42:33] * ebel uses flickr cause it's set into my workflow
[14:42:53] <fagan> flickr costs for more photos
[14:42:58] <fagan> so its not really scalable
[14:43:03] <airurando> ebel do you agree with pix.ie for ubuntu-ie
[14:43:07] <ebel> fagan: yeah, but i pay for it
[14:43:18] <ebel> ye can put your stuff on it if you want
[14:43:28] <fagan> airurando: I agree with it
[14:43:35] <airurando> I know czajkowski wanted to support the Irish company
[14:43:48] <airurando> great stuff
[14:43:56] <airurando> no objections.
[14:44:01] <ebel> I'll still be putting my stuff on flickr, it's all cc anyway :P
[14:44:57] <ebel> do you have to assign copyright to pix.ie photos? or do you retain copyright?
[14:45:21] <ebel> for facebook you must assign copyright to facebook, for flickr you retain copyright
[14:45:33] <ebel> that's one reason i use flickr more than facebook for my photos
[14:45:50] <ebel> however that's a personal choice for each person
[14:45:51] <fagan> does pix.ie charge for more photos
[14:46:42] <airurando> fagan. not sure but how many photos would we be talking abou.
[14:47:03] <fagan> well if we are centralising it I suppose we would be uploading a good lot
[14:47:05] <airurando> ebel: that was my concern
[14:47:08] <ebel> i don't mind paying for photos. bandwidth and storage do cost money :P
[14:47:26] <lau1> I think they do charge but we would nedd to ake a lot of photos to get there
[14:47:27] <fagan> well I have loads of space on my blacknight hosting
[14:47:44] <fagan> if it comes down to a lot and they charge
[14:47:55] * fagan has like 300 gb free
[14:48:02] <ebel> e.g. my photo here http://www.flickr.com/photos/rorymccann/5011980123/ is copyrighted, but copyrighted to me
[14:48:37] <airurando> the pix.ie homepage makes no reference to cost.
[14:48:48] <fagan> so then thats all good
[14:48:51] <airurando> it also states upfront that:
[14:48:54] <airurando> You have full control over your privacy and can keep photos private, restrict who can see them or make them public to share with the world!
[14:49:07] <ebel> same with facebook (technically)
[14:49:42] <fagan> well if they are for release parties and stuff the copyright is less important than getting them all in the one place
[14:50:21] <airurando> I think as we all agreed above to go with pix.ie we shoud move on.
[14:50:25] <fagan> yeah
[14:50:49] <airurando> If someone comes up with negative details re pix.ie then we can revisit.
[14:51:33] <tdr112> ok people lets move on , no one wants a 2 hour meeting
[14:51:36] <ebel> pix.ie don't seem to require copyright assignment (We do not claim ownership of photos that you choose to Post to Pixie. Pixie neither has nor wants any ownership of your photos. However, by posting or making photos available through Pixie, you hereby grant:
[14:51:37] <ebel> )
[14:51:41] <ebel> cf. http://pix.ie/terms
[14:51:58] <lau1> i think it's fine
[14:52:27] <fagan> yeah that looks ok
[14:52:37] <airurando> [AGREED] Ubuntu-ie LoCo to use pix.ie ubuntuie account for centralised storage on Team Event photos.
[14:52:58] <airurando> Any final comments on that?
[14:53:21] <fagan> nope that sounds all good
[14:53:40] <airurando> moving on so.
[14:53:48] <airurando> next topic
[14:53:58] <airurando> [TOPIC] Ubuntu Hours
[14:54:26] <airurando> I put this item on the agenda also.
[14:54:37] <tdr112> ok lets start with Cork
[14:54:48] <tdr112> anyone have an update
[14:55:07] <airurando> I was concerned that the Cork and Limerick Ubuntu Hours might not be going ahead.

[14:55:42] <tdr112> is anyone here from there
[14:56:12] <czajkowski> think limerick will
[14:56:16] <czajkowski> but not sure the day suits
[14:56:18] <airurando> I'm not happy to log the Cork UH in the LD
[14:56:33] <czajkowski> airurando: aye no point in logging a UH if we don't know it wont happen

[14:58:16] <tdr112> yep
[14:58:48] <airurando> [ACTION] airurando to generate Ubuntu Hour listings for Dublin and Limerick for October
[14:59:32] <airurando> if we get feedback from cork we will of course include them in the events listings
[14:59:52] <airurando> but until we get confirmation Cork is dropped.
[15:00:15] <airurando> can someone remove them from the IRC topic?

[15:19:11] <BaconZombie> airurando : We can aim only for hot girls them......
[15:19:46] <airurando> BaconZombie: not appropriate. please be careful.
[15:19:55] <BaconZombie> <_<

[15:20:20] <airurando> In the interest of time I'm going to move on.
