Open the user administration window from System > Administration > User and Groups to set up an account for the kids.

=== 11-12: How anyone can contribute to Ubuntu ===

We'll be discussing the Ubuntu community in general, and sharing a large variety of online resources including IRC, forums, newsletters/mailing lists, interest groups/teams, documentation, artwork, translations, and events/calendars. We will cover LaunchPad accounts as a way to access, and activate single sign on, for Ubuntu community resources. We will wrap up by discussing the bug reporting process.
