__TOC__

I have successfully installed Ubuntu 7.04 (via SATA CDROM drive) on a system built around this mainboard.

Intel Product Link: http://www.intel.com/products/motherboard/DP965LT/index.htm

The following components worked out of the box:
** Audio
** Ethernet
** Serial ATA
** USB
** Firewire
** Serial port

I have not yet been able to test the following:
** Parallel port
** Parallel ATA

So far, I have not found any onboard component which does not work.
