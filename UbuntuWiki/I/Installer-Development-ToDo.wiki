__TOC__

See Installer/Development for technical details on how to get started. Usually best to start with a particular component and learn by expansion from there.

locale configuration (localechooser)
* languagechooser/countrychooser merge incomplete; makes life hard for oem-config

keyboard configuration (console-setup)
* much better now we're using X keymaps
* no translations
* various keymap bugs to be hoovered up one by one

hardware detection (hw-detect)
* mostly done by udev these days
* some hardcoded things remain (weird buses, floppies, PS/2 mice, some IDE stuff, etc.)
* device enumeration order differs in some cases (defer disk detection until all udebs loaded?)

network configuration (netcfg)
* OK for DHCP, static
* wireless largely OK except for WEP glitches and no WPA support
* funky things like PPP not supported (work done in Debian, needs to be integrated)

mirror selection (choose-mirror)
* will need modifications for automatic optimal mirror detection eventually

partitioning (partman)
* needs to be optimised
* error handling poor in places
* parted breaks with newer ext3 filesystems
* RAID interface is clunky; assist Debian redesign along the lines of LVM
* cdebconf plugins could help; requires ABI break in libd-i to fix dependency handling
* writing recipes is hard

DST configuration (clock-setup)
* largely done; may need to check a couple of corner cases

user/password configuration (user-setup)
* historical state machine bugs, but basically done now
* reserved usernames list manually maintained

base system installation (base-installer)
* must be updated when kernel names change
* occasional initramfs generation hiccups

apt configuration (apt-setup)
* various extra bits of preseeding for Ubuntu

package selection (pkgsel)
* tasksel does most of the work now
* task conflict detection
* language-support-* awkwardness

boot loader installers (grub-installer, lilo-installer, yaboot-installer, silo-installer, etc.)
* loads of bugs and lots to try to figure out
* grub is particularly liable to just failing to install for no obvious reason
* lilo used in some cases where grub can't cope (notably XFS)
* probably number one place where extra developer effort would yield good results
* is UbuntuSpec:grub2 any better?
* booting other operating systems (os-prober) largely works but isn't optimal
* some argument for installing simple MBR and chaining to boot loader in partitions; needs very careful thought and testing, probably spec fodder

preseeding (preseed)
* infrastructure Just Works; always needs more testing
* glitches in various components (chiefly partman)

Kickstart (kickseed)
* thin layer over preseeding, so pretty reliable for what it does
* still needs lots more testing to catch changes in underlying preseeding
* has small manual test suite, but should be more automated
* often needs minor updates
* RAID; other features

rescue mode (rescue)
* exiting rescue shell started blowing up in edgy for some reason
* could do with more features for common tasks

miscellaneous infrastructure
* Tollef's cdebconf Unix sockets work
* language packs are IMO impractical, but we should keep translations more up to date somehow

build system (debian-installer)
* needs updates when kernel udebs are rearranged (again)
* careful of netboot initramfs size
* floppies never supported by d-i on 2.6 to date, but recent work in Debian should be investigated

platform support
* Intel Macs done, at least with BIOS compatibility; EFI is more work
* new ports come along from time to time
* typically subarchitecture detection, new bits in hw-detect, sometimes partitioning, boot loader installers

documentation (installation-guide)
* guide isn't bad, but needs various cleanups
* translations; perhaps try to get more changes into Debian protected by conditionals to make this easier

testing
* base-installer has automatic test suite for kernel selection; cdebconf has some manual tests
* many more unit tests would be reasonably straightforward
* automatic system testing (joeyh's digress?)

CD boot loader (syslinux, gfxboot, gfxboot-theme-ubuntu)
* not installer as such, but tightly coupled for locale and keyboard
* gfxboot-theme-ubuntu needs regeneration for new locales and keymaps
* UI glitches
* accessibility

OEM installation (oem-config)
* various minor enhancements in UbuntuSpec:simplify-oem-installation
* should be merged into ubiquity for UI improvements and ease of maintenance
* guide for OEMs

Installation from live CD (ubiquity)
* uses localechooser, tzsetup, console-setup, user-setup, partman, apt-setup, grub-installer, etc.
* <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubiquity/+bugs|bug list]]</nowiki> is massive; bughelper and apport beginning to help
* external partition editors the intrinsic source of many bugs; new partman-based partitioner to address this
** still slow; disk bar UI not done
* grub-installer causes a big chunk of the rest of the problems; probably largely grub's fault
* recover more gracefully from errors, particularly boot loader installation problems
* automatic partitioning UI not as designed yet (needs partman changes)
* lots of minor UI things (UbuntuSpec:feisty-ubiquity)
* UbuntuSpec:ubiquity-slideshow
* better customisation and advanced configuration
* test suite: unit? system? special frontend?
* user guide
