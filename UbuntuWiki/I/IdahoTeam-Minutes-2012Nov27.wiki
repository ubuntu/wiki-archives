=== Tuesday, Nov 27 6:30-8 pm at Open Lab Idaho, Garden City ID ===

Review of command line – Darin led a review discussion on command line. Covered a bit on file traversal (ls, pwd, cd +/..), file permissions (chmod), job control, echo, pipes & filters, grep among others. We will likely revisit this topic in greater depth – it was a good discussion. 

Data Recovery – Curtis gave a presentation on recovering data from a failing flash drive. Presentation notes are posted/shared in Google Group – will post link shortly.

Android Push Notifications – Sheri gave a quick presentation on Push Notifications and how to identify and remove/prevent them. Notes will be shared/linked along with Data Recovery notes shortly.

The meeting ran longer than an hour, and general consensus was that 90 minutes was a better length so we are extending the general meeting time to 6:30-8 PM.

Meeting slides are posted to the <nowiki>[[https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15LYKEKWvmEXUTnoU_N6GiPZqqUk7zj8E1ecKejgc7Qo/edit?forcehl=1&hl=en#slide=id.p6|team G+ site]]</nowiki>.
