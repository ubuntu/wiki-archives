Hi All!

Hoping to have an online meeting of the minds, Ubuntu Illinois LoCo style!

Join me for a meetup here:
 <nowiki>[[https://matrix.to/#/#loco-us-il:ubuntu.com|https://matrix.to/#/#loco-us-il:ubuntu.com]]</nowiki>

on Sunday, November 10 2024 @ 8:00 pm

I will be broadcasting live from my secret underground lair (my basement) and we can discuss Ubuntu, GNU/Linux, technology in general, your hopes and dreams, or anything really!

No need to RSVP, I'll be there and I hope you can make it too.
