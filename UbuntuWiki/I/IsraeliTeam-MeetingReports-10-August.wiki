__TOC__

* We have decided that we won't have a team to advertise the community or the forum.
* We made the decision of how to handle situations that some one wants to say some one is not doing his job in the community.
if some one see that any one doesn't do his/her job then one should talk to the other, if it doesn't help or one doesn't want to say it personally he should address it on the forum and after 2 weeks there will be a vote on the subject, if it's not resolved by this we should go to the PoC, and after that to the council.
* We decided to not have (at least for now) a projects leader.
