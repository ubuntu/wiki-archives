I built a windoze xp system for a client with an Intel DG965OT motherboard.  Ubuntu 6.06 nor 6.10 would install as I was trying to perform a dual boot system.  It hung on booting up and for the life of me I cannot remember the error I received.  I remember performing quite a bit of research on the error and only coming up with the solution of installing 6.06 instead of 6.10 which didn't work.
I do not know the cause of why this motherboard would not install ubuntu so for now I'm not using this motherboard in my systems.  It's possible the motherboard wasn't the cause however an install in my opinion should go fairly straight-forward with no system hanging glitches.

July 2008
I installed Ubuntu 7.10 on the motherboard and it works great.  Haven't tested with 8.04.

Sincerely,
