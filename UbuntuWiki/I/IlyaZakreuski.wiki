=== About Me ===

Hi, I'm 24 years old sysadmin from Minsk, Belarus. My very first Linux experience was in 2003, when I tried Knoppix LiveCD. I've become a regular Linux user since 2005, started with Debian Woody. Since then I've worked with a number of UNIX-like OS's, including BSD and some embedded ones, but still find APT-based distros to be the most integrated and easy to maintain.

Being a bit bored and concerned by software recency in Debian Lenny, I'm switched to Ubuntu on my laptop since Lucid Lynx Alpha early this year. I enjoy software packaging tasks (even for RPM package format), building highly integrated systems, following industry standards and using Emacs text editor for almost every single thing on the planet.

=== Future Goals ===

** Participate in a HugDay events on a regular basis
** Concentrate on some few projects without proper packaging and get them into Ubuntu/Debian
** Help <nowiki>[[http://cm.bell-labs.com/plan9/|Glenda]]</nowiki> to capture the world (not sure)
