'''Launchpad Entry:''' <nowiki>[[https://blueprints.launchpad.net/bantrackertwo/+spec/openid-auth|openid-auth]]</nowiki>

=== Summary ===
Instead of having to issue @btlogin with the bot, the bantracker web ui should be able to let us login with an openID provider.

=== Rationale ===
Currently operators need to issue @btlogin from IRC using a hostmask that the bot recognizes in order receive a url with a unique sessionID attached to it. Once they visit the site via this url, a cookie stores their ability to view the site in the future from that computer. In the past, people have accidentally posted this URL in public channels, which is a security risk.  By decoupling the authentication scheme from IRC we can ensure that this does not happen in the future. Using OpenID and tying it to a single openid provider (Launchpad), we can ensure that only people who should have access do have access.

=== Design ===
n/a

=== Implementation ===
Use <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/django-openid-auth|django-openid-auth]]</nowiki> as an authentication middleware for the django site that will run the Bantracker.
