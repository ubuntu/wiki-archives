=== What is this? ===
Incident reports document how Canonical responds to what we consider to be a '''crisis in Ubuntu'''. Our decision to categorize an event as a ''crisis'' is based on an assessment of the impact of the issue (i.e. is it ''Critical'' as defined by our <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bugs/Importance|Bug Importance descriptions]]</nowiki>):
* Does is affect a significant proportion of users?
* What is the severity of the problem?
* Does it occur in a stable or post-Beta development release?
