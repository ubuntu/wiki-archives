__TOC__

Intel DG965RY with Intel C2D 2.4 GHZ, 82G965 Integrated Graphics Controller, 82566DC Gigabit Network Connection, 82801H (ICH8 Family) HD Audio Controller (5.1 sound not tested)

Installation of Feisty 32 bit, Gutsy 32 and 64 bit works great on this board. Everything works out of the box. Live Cds with a kernel lower than 2.6.22 will not boot due to IDE/Sata transitional chip set. 

The only problem with this board so far is that Live CDs with Kernel older than 2.6.20 don't boot properly. Gparted for example doesn't work on this mobo but parted magic works (2.6.22).

You can pass boot option 'pci=nomconf ide0=0x1018,0x1010'to get some distros to boot and install like CentOS5.
