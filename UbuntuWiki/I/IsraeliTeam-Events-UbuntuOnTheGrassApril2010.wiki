Ubuntu on the grass this time was a change.
We had a lot of changes in our LoCo and it was noticeable on the event.

to this event came 27 friends, sadly I only counted, and I don't remember exactly who was there.
we had the honor to meet some famous FLOSS users that aren't related to Ubuntu :)

we ate some pizza, talked about Linux, Ubuntu, FOSS, Gezer Project (which is a little shoo shoo right now), lightpriest did a little lecture about X server, SSH, and why Linux is the most safe core an there will never be viruses for Ubuntu.

too sad we had no CDs to share, but maybe next time we will have...

We had a real fun :)
cya next version!
