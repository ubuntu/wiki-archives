__TOC__

There is a growing network of companies that provide local support for desktops and servers running Linux/Ubuntu. The premier provider of global support is Canonical Ltd. The idea of this page is to list companies and individuals who are willing to provide support for Ubuntu services here in Ireland. Please sort by Location/County when you add in your details. 

It would be great to get a list of resources people can access from here if they are looking for help, to contract someone in the migration of a network or to hire.
