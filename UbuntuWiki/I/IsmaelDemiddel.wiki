Hello

As a student I became very interested in OpenSource software.
I believe it is the future and especially at schools. To get involved I began with a couple of friends making a book that can be used for children from 6 to 12 years. (ready +- february 2007)

We hope it will work to spread the Ubuntu spirit in Belgium. As a teacher I know a lot of people who wrote books for schools to use and they will also help me with this job. If you feel like you also have something to offer, please register in the Belgian Edubuntu Team.

We are still with just a few people which is not enough to organise install sessions, but we are growing.

I hope we can mean something to the Ubuntu community!

Kind regards
Ismaël Demiddel

P.S. Think free, think OpenSource!
