itnet7 12/08/2010 08:33:49 PM
You would have to go through the registering process on freenode I can get you a link
or if you already own you you would have to authenticate to nickserv 12/08/2010 08:34:07 PM
 
Paul__ 12/08/2010 08:34:08 PM

itnet7 12/08/2010 08:36:48 PM
I am not sure who was going to host the meeting or what needed to be discussed	

rihanha 12/08/2010 08:37:28 PM
i think vorian had some suggestions to share. might still be away	

CurtisElgin 12/08/2010 08:37:50 PM
aye vorian had some ideas to share.	

Paul__ 12/08/2010 08:37:51 PM
im back...	

itnet7 12/08/2010 08:37:54 PM
I saw that the redirection for the forums is working now!	

Paul__ 12/08/2010 08:38:00 PM
this web based IRC is sweet	

itnet7 12/08/2010 08:38:03 PM
That Rocks!	

rihanha 12/08/2010 08:38:31 PM
yeah, great to have that resource thanks chris & curt!

CurtisElgin 12/08/2010 08:38:55 PM
aye did not take them long to get that up and going. awesome job from the forum guys	

rihanha 12/08/2010 08:39:04 PM
and for history	

Paul__ 12/08/2010 08:39:08 PM
yep. this will make it way easier for average joes to login
Chris where are you from? 12/08/2010 08:39:26 PM
Florida? 12/08/2010 08:39:31 PM
is that right? 12/08/2010 08:39:34 PM
 
itnet7 12/08/2010 08:39:35 PM
Paul__: you would have to do: /msg NickServ identify nick <password>
Yes Paul__ ! 12/08/2010 08:39:39 PM
in the other tab of the webclient 12/08/2010 08:39:55 PM
 
Paul__ 12/08/2010 08:40:13 PM
ohh...LOL so you guys dont want to see my password?  	

CurtisElgin 12/08/2010 08:40:36 PM
will you remember it 	

itnet7 12/08/2010 08:40:41 PM
Don't test this, but even if you typed it it won't show here
It might be different in the webclient 12/08/2010 08:41:03 PM
 
Paul__ 12/08/2010 08:41:24 PM
is there a reason that I should not use my real name?	

itnet7 12/08/2010 08:41:45 PM
Oh, no you can, I just didn't know if it was registered on Freenode
and some people don't like using their real names 12/08/2010 08:41:59 PM
 
Paul__ 12/08/2010 08:42:02 PM
i guess curtis did
yeah i was just wondering why 12/08/2010 08:42:08 PM
 
itnet7 12/08/2010 08:42:18 PM
I guess anonymity maybe?	

Paul__ 12/08/2010 08:42:27 PM
i think a name is like a brand and think its good to use a real name sometiems	

itnet7 12/08/2010 08:42:30 PM
I just always used this nick for pc gaming
Definitely true 12/08/2010 08:42:42 PM
 
Paul__ 12/08/2010 08:42:43 PM
unless its linked to bad typing like me	

itnet7 12/08/2010 08:42:48 PM
ROFL	

Paul__ 12/08/2010 08:42:52 PM

who's curtisMo? 12/08/2010 08:43:05 PM
 
itnet7 12/08/2010 08:43:21 PM
CurtisElgin's mobile nick	

CurtisElgin 12/08/2010 08:43:29 PM
I find it easy for people to connect the face to the name if I use my real name. Other wise I get who is gyron.....
my phone 12/08/2010 08:43:36 PM
 
itnet7 12/08/2010 08:43:39 PM
yeah!

Paul__ 12/08/2010 08:44:36 PM

and recently blocked hamachi's VPN protocol 12/08/2010 08:44:49 PM
 
itnet7 12/08/2010 08:44:57 PM
Paul__: I use a non-standard port that is punched through at work
Wow! 12/08/2010 08:45:05 PM
 
CurtisElgin 12/08/2010 08:45:14 PM
cheater ;p	

itnet7 12/08/2010 08:45:18 PM

the webclient uses port 80 so If I can get to my machine from work, I usually just hit that 12/08/2010 08:45:42 PM
 
Paul__ 12/08/2010 08:46:06 PM
yeah i set up an openssh server (adito) so it uses httpS
which is great 12/08/2010 08:46:09 PM
 
itnet7 12/08/2010 08:46:22 PM
Nice!	

Paul__ 12/08/2010 08:46:23 PM

rihanha 12/08/2010 08:52:55 PM

=) 12/08/2010 08:52:57 PM
 
itnet7 12/08/2010 08:53:14 PM
If you guys/gal don't mind, I'm going to try and get the ubulog bot in here too	

rihanha 12/08/2010 08:53:19 PM
best way to build agenda? email or use the meeting wiki page?	

CurtisElgin 12/08/2010 08:53:23 PM

rihanha 12/08/2010 08:53:36 PM

itnet7 12/08/2010 08:53:50 PM
rihanha: My team has a spot where people can add agenda items they would like to be discussed
and everyone should be able to add discussion items 12/08/2010 08:54:09 PM
 
rihanha 12/08/2010 08:54:26 PM
yeah, i was thinking the same. i'll get on it, include it in the note to voria

itnet7 12/08/2010 08:54:54 PM

and if you need anything else for examples hit http://wiki.ubuntu.com/FloridaTeam 12/08/2010 08:55:17 PM
 
CurtisElgin 12/08/2010 08:55:25 PM

CurtisElgin 12/08/2010 08:56:36 PM
