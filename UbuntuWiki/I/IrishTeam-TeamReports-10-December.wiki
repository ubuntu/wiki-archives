* Regular <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/IrishTeam/IRCMeetings/2010-12-15|Monthly IRC Meeting]]</nowiki> was held at 8pm Irish time on Wednesday 15th December 2010.

* Some members of our LoCo gave a hand running a <nowiki>[[http://christmastechiequiz2010.eventbrite.com/| Christmas quiz]]</nowiki> this month. Four other members of our LoCo took part in the quiz and came third. Well done to those fantastic four.  A write-up of the happenings at the quiz can be found <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu-ie.org/node/125| here]]</nowiki> and some photos of the event can be found <nowiki>[[http://www.flickr.com/photos/whykay/sets/72157625665064748/| here]]</nowiki>

* Some members of our community have formed the Ubuntu Ireland LoCo Podcast crew. Planning is underway for the podcast. The first recording is due to take place on the 19th Jan (directly after the monthly IRC meeting). The podcast team can be contacted by email ubuntuiepods-AT-gmail-DOT-com or on Twitter @ubuntuiepods.
