__TOC__

The motherboard states exactly Intel D845GEBV2/D845PESV, I don't know which it is.  The install went great with Ubuntu 6.06, Connected instantly to the internet, monitor went to high resolution, audio worked.  The monitor has the infamous pixel square while installing but eventually recovers to a nice desktop.
