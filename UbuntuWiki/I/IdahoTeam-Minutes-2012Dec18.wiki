=== Tuesday, Dec 18 6:30-8 pm at Open Lab Idaho, Garden City ID ===

We had to move the usual meeting date to accommodate Christmas. Since it was so close to the holidays we decided to forgo a formal discussion topic and just do open topics. It was a small crew but we had a good time discussing old hardware, previous experiences with IT work, hobby projects and of course Ubuntu.
