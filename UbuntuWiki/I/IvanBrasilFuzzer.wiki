=== About me ===
<nowiki>[[File:IvanBrasilFuzzer.jpg]]</nowiki>
<<BR>>
My first contact with free software was in 1998 with Conectiva Marumbi and I started using Ubuntu in 2005. In 2006 I started a site to document my learning about Ubuntu. I worked with translation for a time. Since this date I have dedicated myself in various ways for the user community: attending events, giving lectures, courses, disseminating the philosophy of Ubuntu and bringing in new members.<<BR>>
In early 2012, after attending events representing or assisting the Ubuntu-BR I was chosen as leader of the Ubuntu-BR-RS LoCo Team. Since this date I have worked to promote events of Ubuntu and improve visibility and participation of the group in the country. Also I reported bugs in Lauchpad and have helped users through the Mailing Lists and IRC.<<BR>>
I think Ubuntu is an incredible way to share knowledge and bring people together through an ideal. Because of this, I want to continue contributing to the community in the best way possible.
