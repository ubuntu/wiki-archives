__TOC__

I have installed Feisty Fawn 7.04 on an Intel D945GTPLKR motherboard without any complications and the onboard peripherals (excluding audio/video) worked properly upon first boot. I have never enabled the onboard sound or video. So, I am unsure of their compatibility. I'm running a Pentium D 2.8GHz with 2 GB of DDR2 RAM. The motherboard was originally from an older Dell Optiplex GX620, I believe. I haven't had any noticeable problems yet.

If anyone has tested the onboard sound/video - please update.
