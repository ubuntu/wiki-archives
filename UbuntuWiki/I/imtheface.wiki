== a tale of an ordinary folk ==

Born as '''Andy Apdhani''' on third planet from the sun! *still looking a way to escape from the gravity, anybody know how?*. I am a huge fan of Free and Open Source Software *i cheers you all people who's give their time and effort to make a better software*. Been using Slackware in the past and finally fall in love with Ubuntu, since i recieved my Hoary CD for the first time!
