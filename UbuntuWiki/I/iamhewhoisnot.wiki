__TOC__

My Name is Justin Williams.
 
I live in Phoenixville, PA.

I've been using Ubuntu since the first version, and Linux for almost 10 years.

I haven't been active in the community so I'm trying to get involved now by following all the steps to complete my Launchpad Profile. 

This is just a generic wiki profile. I'll update it eventually.
