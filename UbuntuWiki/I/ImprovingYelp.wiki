=== Summary ===

Yelp assumes a manual style of documentation, so while it will take an enormous amount of work to move the documentation in a new direction, there are many easy, incremental improvements we can make to Yelp as it is.

=== Rationale ===

=== Use cases ===

=== Scope ===

* search: might be tough for dapper
** beagle patch clahey is working on
** requires beagle in desktop seed
** the other patch that turned up a few months ago: python based, we could help its introduction to upstream
* hide table of contents pane (ToC already shown in main pane)
** which ToC - the full system help ToC, or the document ToC?
* improve the toolbar
** 'home' button goes to yelp home page, confusing in document context
* smaller default window size and toolbar arrangement
* ensure that fnord is not in xhtml with css
* footer linking to online help from every page
* launching arbitrary applications?
** irc handler in yelp instead?

=== Implementation ===
