A place to collect notes about the KDE 4.2 Upgrade process in Intrepid

4.1.3 to 4.2 Beta 2 on mature Intrepid installation (seele)
* Upgrade process (used Adept)
** MySQL asks to configure root password 3 times
* Post upgrade
** Some plasmoids are broken: Bball, Binary Clock, Calculator, Character Selector, Color Picker, Comics Strip, Dictionary, Eyes, ... Timer, Twitter
** Not using the kde4 network manager?
** Akanodi appears to have done its job.  No problems with Kmail or other PIM-related data
** Kontact is not starting when akonadi ressource is used in korganizer, korganizer standalone is working. Problem appears on two differnet machines. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:neversfelde]]</nowiki>   * Kickoff width changes strangely.. from 500px (obviously too wide) to 200 px (too small, have scrolling in many app descriptions)
** If you turn Fast User Switching off in the krunner configuration options, you can't switch users (the option doesn't show up and an alternate way does not appear)
