=== Bugs without a package ===
Sometimes bugs will be reported just using the "Ubuntu" package.  This is not the best place for the bug though and we should encourage bug reporters to report the bug against the correct package by pointing them at some documentation. Keep in mind PKGNAME is a placeholder. 

/!\ If you use this response, you must assign a package. If you do not know what package to assign, please leave the bug alone, and ask for help.

=== A duplicate ===
When making a bug report a duplicate of another it is important to communicate to the reporter that any discussion regarding the bug should take place in the master bug.  Keep in mind that NUMBER is a placeholder and should be the number of the master bug report.
