 21:09:23 <tdr112> PRESENT

 21:10:00 <ebel> #topic review

 21:10:07 <ebel> #subtopic DNS

 21:10:31 <ebel> (Changing ubuntu-ie.org DNS to point to blacknight)

 21:10:38 <ebel> I haven't looked into this yet, sorry.

 21:10:53 <moylan> christmas happened. :-)

 21:10:56 <ebel> Canonical have some fancy commands you can do to change DNS parameters w/ permissions etc.

 21:11:38 <ebel> but haven't looked into it yet.

 21:11:54 <ebel> sorry, i'll try to look into again

 21:11:57 <ebel> #subtopic

 21:12:08 <ebel> #subtopic infoturtle to be ready to maintain, install & admin new website

 21:12:43 <ebel> but infoturtle isn't here....

 21:13:07 <ebel> perhaps we leave this until later, infoturtle might show up

 21:13:08 <moylan> shelve it till next meeting?

 21:13:21 <ebel> #subtopic ebel to reply to people w.r.t. cds

 21:13:55 <ebel> I have replied to everyone who expressed an interest in getting some CDs, and gave my address. I haven't recieved any SAEs and haven't sent any CDs out â˜¹

 21:14:10 <ebel> So we still have about half the CDs left.

 21:14:56 <ebel> Anyone want any?

 21:15:18 <moylan> i use netbooks so cds are superfluous

 21:15:51 <ebel> I'm unsure why the uptake has been so low this time, could be a combination of (a) me idlying too long with sending them out (b) people waiting for LTS (c) "send me a SAE" is more effort than when I posted them CDs for free

 21:16:33 <moylan> i think these days most installs are from usb

 21:17:45 <ebel> perhaps...

 21:19:02 <ebel> any comments on the review of previous action items?

 21:19:12 <moylan> no

 21:19:50 <ebel> #topic Campuscon this Saturday from tdr112

 21:20:48 <ebel> Did you get the CDs I left in TOG? Do you want/need any more?

 21:21:05 <tdr112> i have them

 21:21:09 <tdr112> i am in tog now

 21:22:34 <tdr112> if any is in the area feel free to drop by and get a cd

 21:22:39 <tdr112> thats all
