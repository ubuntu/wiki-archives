== Indicator Tests ==

Manual testing for the indicators and dependencies

=== Packages: ===
* ido
* dbusmenu
* libindicate
* libindicator
* libappindicator
* appmenu-gtk
* indicator-appmenu
* indicator-session
* indicator-datetime
* indicator-sound
* indicator-application
* indicator-messages

All packages require passing unit tests as well as manual tests.  There are 
inter-dependencies to consider in testing, for example a dbusmenu release 
means we need to test the indicators and appmenu.

To test the indicators, you'll need libindicator3-tools installed.
