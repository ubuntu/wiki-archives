== Introduction ==
The Kubuntu developers have been hard at work, bringing you the latest and greatest software the open source community has to offer. This is the Kubuntu 8.10 Release Candidate, which brings a host of excellent new features, and a whole new KDE4 desktop.

This Intrepid release lives up to its name by including many changes, but there are some features that are not yet available in KDE4.  If you would rather stay with what you know, Kubuntu 8.04 is still fully supported, see <nowiki>[[Kubuntu-KDE3-KDE4Migration]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[http://techbase.kde.org/Schedules/Is_KDE_4.1_for_you%3F|Is KDE 4.1 for you?]]</nowiki> for more information on deciding.  You can try it first with the Kubuntu Intrepid Live CD and see.

'''NOTE:''' ''This is a Release Candidate. Do not install it on production machines. The final stable version is scheduled to be released on October 30, 2008.''

== Upgrading from 8.04 ==
To upgrade from Kubuntu 8.04, press Alt+F2 and type in ''' kdesudo "adept_manager --dist-upgrade-devel" ''' (including quotes) into the command box. Adept should open up and offer a Version Upgrade button. Click Version Upgrade and follow the on-screen instructions.
