==== Oliver Grawert: Patching u-boot for use in an Ubuntu Core gadget snap ====

On the second post from the series on Building u-boot gadget snap packages from source, Oliver Grawert takes a closer look at the uboot.patch file that comes with the default board configuration for building the u-boot binaries. Expanding about the morale behind its design, Oliver goes onto pointing out its shortcomings and suggests a more generic method to get all the boards working in the snapd environment.

https://ograblog.wordpress.com/2017/06/13/patching-u-boot-for-use-in-an-ubuntu-core-gadget-snap/

==== Ted Gould: Replacing Docker Hub and Github with Gitlab ====

Ted Gould teaches readers how to replace Docker Hub and Git``Hub with Git``Lab by creating a branch on Git``Hub and adding an automated build to Docker Hub. He accomplishes this with a simple Docker file, explaining that the whole process saved him one or two minutes per build, a 10% savings in total pipeline time.

http://gould.cx/ted/blog/2017/06/15/Replacing-Docker-Hub-and-Github-with-Gitlab/

==== Stéphane Graber: Custom user mappings in LXD containers ====

Stéphane Graber writes about LXD, the lightweight container hypervisor, builds on the classic LXC by being more intuitive and easier to use. He dwells on the aspect of LXD having unprivileged containers by default and the limited size of the default map thereof. Stéphane posts solutions and workarounds for this issue, coming up with neat and intuitive set of code, with proper outputs for reference.

==== Simon Raffeiner: My Ubuntu for mobile devices post mortem analysis ====

Simon Raffeiner provides his thoughts on why the Ubuntu for mobile devices failed. Simon starts by outlining his involvement with the project, provides clues as to what he felt the project needed to be successful, problems with the project, and devices produced including marketing, before wrapping up with a FAQ list of questions in his lengthy article.

==== Marco Trevisan (Treviño): GNOME Fractional (and multi-monitor) Scaling Hackfest, the report ====

Marco Trevisan talks about the recently held hackfest on GNOME fractional scaling at the Canonical office in Teipei 101. He gives us a brief summary of the main objectives of the event and also how they proceeded achieving those. He says that in spite of some of the topics of interest being too much to solve right away, he details that they have been looked upon and will be addressed in the coming weeks after the event.

==== Mathieu Trudel-Lapierre: Netplan by default in 17.10 ====

Mathieu Trudel-Lapierre tells us that he has updated the nplan package to 0.24 and tell so of the changes, relating to the ubuntu-minimal iso. He says that MaaS, cloud-init and others have already started supporting writing netplan configs and includes links to the specification, summary wiki, blueprint, documentation, and IRC channel.

==== Brian Murray: Getting information about LP bugs with lots of duplicates ====

Brian Murray discusses getting information from Launchpad relating to bugs with many duplicates. Brian then discusses the tools available on Launchpad such as lp-bug-dupe-properties and how these can simplify the process and save time.
