== Main Inclusion Report for cdebconf-keystep ==

=== Requirements ===

# ''Availability:'' http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/c/cdebconf-keystep, available for all supported architectures (as soon as it clears NEW and builds)
# ''Rationale:''
** It's the result of factoring out all the keyboard detection code from cdebconf into its own widget.  It is needed by kbd-chooser to work correctly.
 0. ''Security:''
** It's a library which runs inside d-i, it should not have any security impact whatsoever.
 0. ''Quality assurance:''
** Package works out of the box without configuration.
** Canonical (Tollef Fog Heen) is upstream.
 0. ''Standards compliance:'' 
** Standard debhelper packaging, standard patch system.
 0. ''Dependencies:''
** All in main.
