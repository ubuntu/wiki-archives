==== Randall Ross: The Line That Divides ====

Randall Ross summarizes Mark Shuttleworth’s recent talk at Mobile World Congress 2016 and some of the key points to take away from it. He highlights Mark’s graph about societal acceptance of a new idea or platform. “Successful entrepreneurs and innovators live on the left side of the vertical line depicted in the graph. The curves on the chart represent the level of acceptance of an idea (or product) into society.” He highlights Ubuntu’s recent step to adopt OpenPOWER. “The notion of a ragtag group of dreamers taking on a hardware monopoly seems by most to be "crazy".” He ends by restating Mark’s point: “The answer probably depends on which side of the line you ask.”

==== 10 reasons why you should stop picking on Ubuntu Unity ====

Jack writes about ten different reasons why you should consider it again. He highlights convergence, Ubuntu Touch, eliminated privacy risks, and the new ability to move the launcher. He ends by saying: “Ubuntu Unity is not the desktop pariah you once thought it was. This desktop environment has evolved into a beautiful, efficient interface that does not deserve the scorn and derision heaped upon it by so many.”

http://www.techrepublic.com/article/10-reasons-why-you-should-stop-picking-on-ubuntu-unity/

==== Ubuntu convergence finally impresses me ====

Jack Wallen for Tech Republic points out that he is impressed with the Ubuntu convergence concept and points out some pros and cons of convergence and Ubuntu Touch. “I hope this happens. Canonical and the Ubuntu Phone developers have been working tirelessly on this project and it needs (nay, deserves) a win of this magnitude.”

http://www.techrepublic.com/article/ubuntu-convergence-finally-impresses-me/

==== Ubuntu Is Close To Finally Removing Python 2 From Their Desktop ISO ====

Michael Larabel from Phoronix summarizes Barry Warsaw’s update and push to get Python 2 off of the desktop image for Ubuntu. “He explains that it's in the printer space the cause for still keeping Python 2 around... "system-config-printer is already itself ported to Python 3, but it transitively depends on Python 2 through the chain of python3-smbc to libsmbclient to samba-libs to libpython2.7. So the real problem is fully porting Samba to Python 3. Ubuntu is not the only distro converging on this bottleneck."”
