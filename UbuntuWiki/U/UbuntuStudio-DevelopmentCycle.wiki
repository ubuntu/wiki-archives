== Development Cycle ==

Currently, development is done in 6 months periods, correlating with our releases. Usually Ubuntu Studio is released in April and October of every year.
LTS (long term support release) is released every 2 years, and development for that is done over a two years period.

=== Release Schedule ===

To keep track of important dates, we use a development release schedule. See our current <nowiki>[[UbuntuStudio-DevelopmentReleaseSchedule|developmemt release schedule]]</nowiki> for an oversight of important dates.

=== Important Events ===

A development cycle is divided into different periods, following the important events that occur.
