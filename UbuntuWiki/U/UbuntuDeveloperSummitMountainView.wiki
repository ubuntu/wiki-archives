As development of a new release of Ubuntu began, Canonical sponsored a week-long developer summit, gathering Ubuntu developers from around the world to help shape and scope the next release of our beloved distribution. The summit was open to the public, but it was '''not a conference''', exhibition or other audience-oriented event. Rather, it was an opportunity for Ubuntu developers -- who usually collaborate online -- to work together in person on specific tasks.

Small groups of developers participated in short (45-60 minute) BOF sessions where a single project was discussed, documenting the outcome of the discussion in a written specification.  These specifications will be used for planning the new release of Ubuntu, as described in FeatureSpecifications and TimeBasedReleases.
