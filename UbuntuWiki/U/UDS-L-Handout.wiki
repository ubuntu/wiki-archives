==== How to Run a Session ====

* Ensure key people who are needed to be at the spec are present. If not, send runners to track them down before you begin.
* Designate at least one person as a scribe. They will be responsible for:
** Creating a document on Gobby and taking notes during the session, enforcing the per-track naming method (see below).
** Transcribing details from the whiteboard into the Gobby session.
** Involve the people in IRC in the discussion by asking questions that get asked in IRC to the participants
** If the scribe is also participating in the session then you want at least two people taking notes or things will be missed
* Ensure the IRC channel is displayed on the projector so that remote participants can be seen by the attendees.
* Set an agenda for the session
* Stay away from tangents; if there needs to be further discussion, create a new session on the schedule
* Focus on what can be done for this release, don't waste time talking about a long term plan unless that is part of the goals for that session
* At the end of the session, update Launchpad to reflect the status of the specification.
** If more discussion is needed, the status should be set to Discussion
** If discussion is complete, but time is needed to work on the specification, set it to Drafting
** If the specification is written and ready for review, set it to Review
* After the session, use the notes to draft a specification document
** It is crucial that the discussion be documented so that the conclusions are recorded and shared with the community

* Gobby Best Practices
** Save early, save often. If you can, have multiple people saving it.
** Naming your document:
*** '''To keep the document list sane, name your documents as $trackname-$title'''. Examples: community-forums-outreach, server-ldap-auth, or kernel-bugs.
*** Since gobbby keeps this list alphabetized it will keep the document list neat and easier to use.
