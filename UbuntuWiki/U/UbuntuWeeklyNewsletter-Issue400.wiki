Canonical announces that snappy Ubuntu Core is now available on Vagrant Cloud.  Vagrant enables a cross platform developer experience on MacOS, Windows or Linux; however, due to how the Ubuntu Core works, shared file systems within Vagrant are not possible at this time. “We are working on getting the shared file system support enabled and will announce this in due course,” noted the article.

==== Ronnie Tucker: Ubuntu Phone Details ====

In this article, Ronnie Tucker gets Ubuntu Phone details from Canonical. “Users deserve a richer, faster and unfragmented experience built around the things they do most on their devices,” says Canonical.  “With the Ubuntu phone we are moving away from the app grid towards integrated content and services. And we do this by providing a user experience that is centered on bringing the key mobile digital life services directly to the screen, which at the heart we call ‘scopes.’”  Readers can find out more about ‘scopes” and how Canonical wants to improve the user experience for Ubuntu Phone users.

=== In The Press ===

==== You'll get sick of that iPad. And guess who'll be waiting? Big daddy Linux... ====

Scott Gilbertson of The Register looks at device convergence in this article. Gilbertson talks to Jon Melamut, VP of professional and engineering services for Canonical to get his thoughts on the subject.  Melamut says in regards to Linux in the mobile space that "Ubuntu for phones has been a major focus for Canonical, and we’re now in a position to bring devices to market."  Gilbertson notes this “true device convergence” is still a ways off and the success of Ubuntu and others in the space still remains to be seen.  In his conclusion, Gilbertson wonders if desktop “power-users” will ever switch to a mobile based device.

==== Ubuntu Phone: The little phone that could ====

Jack Wallen of Tech``Republic discusses how the the Ubuntu Phone could succeed as easily as it could fail. He looks at the competition from Android and iOS, the availability of apps, and gives us a brief specification of the device. Jack says in his conclusion: "If anyone can do it, I have every faith that it will be Canonical."

==== Why Scopes, Not Apps, Are Ubuntu Phone’s Secret Weapon ====

Joey-Elijah Sneddon of OMG! Ubuntu! says that in the build up to the launch of the Ubuntu Phone, he'll be highlighting some of his favorite features, and that the first is Scopes which work differently to those on the desktop.
