* '''Let''' the other person explain his point of view by asking <nowiki>[[http://youtu.be/8y5tuJ3Sojc|intelligent questions]]</nowiki>. In the end, who is able to understand better one's reasons is oneself; and people like this to be recognized.
* '''Anger''' is other face of fear. Sometimes people get angry because '''their own motives''', rather because of something with you.
* '''Contra-argumentating''' so hardly many times is a clear indicator that the person recognizes the proposed solution is already good, but the person wants to '''get sure''' there isn't any drawback in taking it.
* People tend to '''over-react''' on new changes, but this can easily be reverted by showing them how these changes already connect with their '''own objectives''' (not yours); and '''showcasing before''' getting into words.
* What is '''visually measured''' tends to improve itself. Use the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Ubuntu%20Evangelist/Social%20tool-kit|social tool-kit]]</nowiki> for actually '''being objective''' of what's really going on.
* Evangelizing is '''more about informing''' than convincing, because convincing oneself takes time. With key information people tend to choose wisely what options actually makes things '''simpler'''.
