==== How Ubuntu is Made ====

Sean Michael Kerner writes - Recent years have seen the Ubuntu Linux distribution, led by Canonical, experiencing rapid growth in both users and features. With the upcoming Ubuntu 10.10 Maverick Meerkat release, set for October, Ubuntu developers will continue to push the boundaries further of both server and desktop Linux. Sitting at the upper rung of Ubuntu's engineering efforts is Matt Zimmerman, Canonical's CTO, who helps to lead Ubuntu's technical direction.

==== Daily Dose of Scribus Trunk ====

Canonical now uses the desktop publishing tool Scribus for many marketing materials. The Scribus project has made big strides recently, but unfortunately the Scribus package in Ubuntu is a bit dated. Mark discovered that Philip Muskovac is working on having daily PPA builds available, and includes details on where to get it.

==== Edubuntu Gets a New Installer ====

Edubuntu 10.04 introduced a new GUI LTSP and Netbook interface installation. It was an improvement upon previous implementations, but not all that intuitive. Stéphane covers new improvements coming up in Edubuntu 10.10 that makes LTSP and the new Ubuntu Unity interface easier to install than ever.

==== Magic Trackpad Drivers Land in Ubuntu Maverick and Upstream! ====

If you’ve read some of my previous posts, you’ll note that I’ve been spending some time adding Magic Trackpad functionality to the current Magic Mouse driver in the kernel. I’m pleased to report that the changes have landed both in Ubuntu and upstream in Jiri Kosina’s HID tree as it awaits merging into Linus’ tree. It will be available in Ubuntu 10.10 and hopefully in Linux 2.6.37.

==== Measuring the Value of Canonical’s Launchpad ====

Christopher Tozzi writes - Canonical’s most famous project is Ubuntu.  But Launchpad, another of the company’s major endeavors, has been around just as long–even though many casual Ubuntu users may not be aware of its existence.  Here’s a look at the value Launchpad offers, and where it fits into Canonical’s present and future.

==== Broadcom swims upstream, tackles Linux WiFi woes with new open drivers ====

Ryan Paul writes - Broadcom announced today the initial release of its new open source  wireless drivers for Linux. The drivers, which are built using the  kernel's own native SoftMAC framework, are currently in the kernel  staging tree and are expected to eventually be merged upstream.

According to a Canonical's Jeremy Foshee,  the new drivers will be included in the upcoming Ubuntu 10.10 release  and may be backported to the current stable version. The driver  currently supports BCM4313, BCM43224, and BCM43225, but it can be  extended in the future to support additional Broadcom hardware  components.

==== Ubuntu One Music Store in the Wild ====

Bob Mattes posts about his first experiences with the Ubuntu One Music Store. Although he originally meant to try it before now, it's only recently that he first actually used it. He was impressed with the range of music and found the interface clear. He does say that he needed to update his Rythmbox from a PPA to stop a pop-up saying he needed to install a plug-in that didn't exist. He also has a warning for US users that while prices are in dollars, the company that provides the music store is UK based so there may still be an international transaction fee, which can be avoided by using paypal. Overall, however, he enjoyed his experience of the music store.

==== Broadcom Announces Open-Source 802.11n Driver ====

While the driver is still a work in progress and lacking many options, none the less this represents a huge step for the Open Source Community and Broadcom's involvement.

==== Debunking the 1% Myth ====

Caitlyn Martin writes -  Linux market share is not tiny. Linux and UNIX have held a majority share of the server room for over a decade. Linux is very competitive in embedded devices. It is also making great strides on the consumer and business desktop, which includes laptops, notebooks and netbooks.
Let's start with netbooks, the area where Linux has made the biggest inroads. According to ABI Research Linux regained 32% of the netbook market in 2009 despite being next to impossible to find in brick and mortar stores.Dell also reported that nearly a third of their netbook sales in 2009 were systems preloaded with Ubuntu. Recent reports that there was no longer demand for Linux on netbooks and that Dell was dropping Linux proved to be false. Indeed, as of today Dell is offering laptop and desktop models preloaded with Ubuntu in addition to the Inspiron Mini 10n netbook.

==== Ubuntu One Blog: Ubuntu One Maverick beta update ====

Special thanks go out to the Ubuntu Maverick alpha and beta testers and those that are informing us of Ubuntu One bugs in the release. Our team has been hard at work resolving them so I thought I’d provide a brief summary of a few of the most recent fixes.

* Ubuntu One is now using the new Ubuntu SSO authentication service. There have been many bug fixes along with this change that will make creating an Ubuntu One account more convenient and signing-in to add a computer more reliable

* Fixed the application name “Ubuntu One” that we display at https://login.ubuntu.com/+applications
* Added the Nautilus Ubuntu One ribbon and implemented fixes for when it is visible, how it functions, and some related Nautilus crashing issues
* Fixes to Nautilus displaying published files
* Many server side improvements to improve server resource efficiency and enhance desktop sync speed
* Usability enhancements to the contact picker which will make privately sharing folders using your Evolution address book an easier process
* The Ubuntu One Music Store is now available to Maverick testers using Rhythmbox. A fix is coming soon for Banshee

==== TurnKey unveils a new kind of smart backup/restore system, powered by Amazon S3 ====

This week Turn``Key Linux, an Ubuntu based project, officially unveiled
TKLBAM (Turn``Key Backup and Migration), a smart, fully automated backup
and restore facility powered by the Amazon S3 storage cloud.

Fully automating the backup and restore process makes it practical for
the first time to easily test backups "in the cloud", and migrate full
systems (e.g., servers) anywhere in minutes.

"We designed TKLBAM to be our ideal open source backup system. Imagine a fully
automated backup and restore system with no pain. That you wouldn't need
to configure. That just magically knows what to backup and, just as
importantly, what NOT to backup, to create super efficient, encrypted
backups of changes to files, databases, package management state, even
users and groups."
