==== Ubuntu 6.10 release candidate released ====
The Ubuntu 6.10 release candidate was announced by Tollef Fog Heen on October 19th. The last expected release before the final button is pushed on October 26th, the release candidate allows the last bug fixes checks to be done for final release. You can read more at https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-announce/2006-October/000092.html. The Xubuntu 6.10 release candidate was announced a few days later by Jani Monoses. You can read more at https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel-announce/2006-October/000213.html.

==== Ubuntu 7.04 named ====
On October 18th, Mark Shuttleworth announced the codename for the sixth release of Ubuntu, "The Feisty Fawn".  The name is meant to embody the spirit of courage and restless exploration of a young deer as Ubuntu continues to develop better hardware support in all configurations and investigate brand new developments on the desktop.

==== Kids say thanks ====
A before/after-school club in England thanks Edubuntu for making it possible for their kids to have access to a computer.  See the forums post at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=280193.

==== Ubuntu presentation by the Canonical tech support team in Montreal, Canada ====
Last week, a local advocacy group for open computing,FACiL, presented Jeff Bailey and his technical support team for Canonical in Montreal. Jeff presented Ubuntu LTS in both french and english, answering questions and giving insights about the current and future plans for technical support. The video is available in Ogg Theora format, thanks to Fabian Rodriguez from the Ubuntu-Quebec Loco Team and Gulus.

==== Accessibility development mailing list created ====
The last meeting of the Ubuntu Accessibility Team included the decision to create a new mailing list dedicated to the development of accessibility features.  The old list will continue, but will be more focused on general discussion and support, and hopefully be less intimidating for new list users, while the new one will be able to really dig into deeper-level development discussion.

=== Changes In Edgy ===

This week was pretty quiet, as the release candidate slowed the uploads to main and universe to almost a crawl.

Ubuntu artwork underwent its final change this week, with many different packages uploaded for various pieces. Daniel Holbach uploaded edgy-wallpapers 0.7 with a new default wallpaper, edgy-community-wallpapers 0.4, edgy-wallpapers 0.8, edgy-community-wallpapers 0.5, human-cursors-theme 0.4 and edgy-session-splashes 0.4. usplash-theme-ubuntu 0.3 was uploaded by Tollef Fog Heen while edgy-gdm-themes 0.7 found it was into Ubuntu via Frank Schoep.

Just in time for the final release, Chuck Short uploaded xen-3.0 3.0~rc5 and then the final xen-3.0 3.0.3 this week. 

Jani Monoses uploaded a number of Xubuntu packages this week, including xubuntu-default-settings 0.22, which add a trash applet and enabled accessibility support, xfdesktop4 4.3.99.1svn+r23428, an SVN snapshot for bugfixes, xubuntu-meta 2.22 adding gnome-app-install (more commonly known as Add/Remove) and gcalctool to xubuntu-desktop and finally orage 4.3.99.1svn+r23486, another SVN snapshot for bug fixes.

There were a few multimedia applications uploaded this week by Sebastian Droege, including banshee 0.11.1, banshee-official-plugins 0.11.1, thoggen 0.6.0 (which ported thoggen to gstreamer 0.10), and libipoddevice 0.5.1.

Raphael Pinson uploaded some new Ichthux packages, this week, including ichthux-default-settings 1:6.10, with a new theme and ichthux-meta 1.0ubuntu3, which adds ichthux-doc and ichthux-konqueror-shorcuts.  

==== Rebuilding all packages on i386 ====

Lucas Nussbaum rebuilt all the packages on i386 to uncover problems in the archives. More information about the project can be found at https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2006-October/021858.html.

For the hasty, you can view the failed builds at http://tiber.tauware.de/~lucas/ftbfs/20061019/00FTBFS-List.txt and the build logs at http://tiber.tauware.de/~lucas/ftbfs/20061019/.

=== In The Press ===

Speculation about an Oracle/Canonical partnership has heated up this week with numerous articles appearing throughout the world's tech press:

''In an interview with CNET News, Mark Shuttleworth, founder and CEO of Ubuntu Linux developer Canonical, would not comment on the question of whether an Ubuntu Linux partnership with Oracle is in the pipeline.''

''What is one to make of a "no comment" answer to a direct question?''

''If Canonical wasn't working with Oracle on some sort of Ubuntu plan, he would have said no. Why would Shuttleworth leave the question open to speculation if nothing was happening?''

''The obvious conclusion would seem to be that something is happening. Oracle and Canonical are either in discussions or a deal has already been struck.''

Oracle OpenWorld is this week so the question will likely be answered soon. Read more at http://www.itwire.com.au/content/view/6517/983/

Meanwhile, Mark was also recently interviewed by the BBC's Gareth Mitchell for ''Digital Planet''.  You can see what they have to say about Mark and Ubuntu and hear the interview at http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6080048.stm.

=== Feature Of The Week: Scribus ===

Scribus is an open-source, cross-platform desktop publishing application.  It has a very user-friendly interface but also includes professional-grade tools like advanced color controls and convenient PDF creation.

If you've been looking for something to use the next time you slap together a newsletter for your campus student group, and need to be able to do complex page formatting and work with people using Windows too you can suggest Scribus.  While this is a very simple example and hardly touches on its capabilities, take a look:

To give it a try: ''sudo apt-get install scribus''

==== How to Help Kill a Bug that Annoys You ====
There are times when an application does not work as expected. In some cases this is a bug. Report them, this makes your software better.  Additionally, you can help out at the UbuntuBugDay on Wednesday.

==== When to find bugs ====
The best time to find a bug is early in the programs lifecycle as it is being prepared for the next release, not right at the start but the first snapshot that is taken of the development cycle. You should look at the critical applications in your distro that you use and check they work during the beta cycles. This allows developers iron out the issues before the next release. With the exception of the LTS software we don't expect to see problems resolved after a release is issued, unless it is a security issue. (More information here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TimeBasedReleases )

==== How to report them ====
The report should be done as soon as the program terminates incorrectly.

What you need to report.

Information about what you as the user were doing or trying to do before the error occurred. What the expected behaviour was, what the actual behaviour of the program was. What error messages if any occurred, all of them is a good starting point.

To report bugs on Ubuntu, get an account on [WWW] http://launchpad.net, find the package in the version of Ubuntu you have and share the information you have. It is better to report half correctly and let someone else come along and confirm it.

Your first step in this location is to check that the bug has not been reported already. If it has then confirm it for your platform and so on.

Comments can be added after the initial edit, in fact you may be asked for more detail after you report.

Have a look at a few bugs on launchpad to get a feeling for what is usual.

==== What NOT To Do ====
You should not simply report that "Program X is broken", this is not a fault report, it is in fact a "faulty bug report", which means that it is useless. It lacks the essential ingredient, appropriate information.
