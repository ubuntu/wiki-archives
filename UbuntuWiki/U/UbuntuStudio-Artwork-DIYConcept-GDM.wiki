__TOC__

Keep in mind:
* Thumbnails should be no greater in height than 300px. Link to larger images.
* All submissions must fit the design direction as laid out <nowiki>[[UbuntuStudio-Artwork-DIYConcept|HERE]]</nowiki>.
* GDM with new features looks like it will be used for Ubuntu and thus Ubuntu Studio 8.04 so one will need to be up on what it can do.
