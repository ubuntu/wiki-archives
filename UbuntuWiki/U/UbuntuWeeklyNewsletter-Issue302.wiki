=== General Community News ===

==== Smart Scopes ====

Jono Bacon announces increased development effort into the Unity dash and “Smart Scopes” which “will result in a significantly greater number of scopes (potentially 100) shipped by default and a better search experience that is smarter in the way scopes are searched for terms, thus delivering better results and higher performance.” Bacon also notes that the Canonical Community Team “will also be launching a project over the coming few weeks to grow the range of scopes ready for 13.04 and ease the development process.”

==== Ubuntu App Developer Blog: Develop locally, run remotely ====

Michael Hall informs us about the progress being made in the Ubuntu phone project. According to Hall, app developers can test apps locally on their desktops. There is also the possibility of running apps remotely on other Ubuntu systems thanks to Andrea Grandi who has been working “under Canonical’s Skunkworks program with a focus on enabling the developer tools around the SDK.” You can read more about remote testing on Grandi’s blog:

In a series of 3 posts, Daniel Holbach writes about the recently held Ubuntu Developer Week. Attendees had a diverse pallet of lectures from how to start with Ubuntu development to automated testing in Ubuntu. Holbach writes “All the logs and videos are linked from the timetable, so you can still enjoy the sessions again and again.”

==== Alan Bell: Ubuntu Smart Scopes ====

Alan Bell brings us a very thorough walkthrough of how the new Smart Scopes feature of Ubuntu works. Bell writes: “Lenses are now called master scopes, You control each individual scope that you want to search in or not search in, not the master scopes so you will have 100 or so things to turn on or off, If you install a local scope then your client will tell the server the name of that scope” and much more.

==== Ubuntu Classroom: Interested in helping with Quality? Several sessions next week! ====

Elizabeth Krumbach announces upcoming IRC-based sessions about quality in Ubuntu to be held on the already announced Ubuntu User Days. Topics include reporting bugs, introduction to QA tools, and more. Most will be held in #ubuntu-classroom, but on Saturday the 9th, some sessions will be in #ubuntu-quality to avoid conflict with User Days.

==== Victor Tuson Palau: [Ubuntu QML] SimpleToDo.. done! ====

Victor Tuson Palau informs us about his progress with QML and SimpleToDO applications. Not only that, he is finished with translation which he described in his previous post here http://victorpalau.net/2013/01/25/ubuntu-qml-todo-android-vs-ubuntu/ . Palau went a little further to include work with UI and menus for Ubuntu QML.

==== Charles Profitt: Friendly Needs You! ====

Charles Profitt gives us an update on the Ubuntu Friendly project about which he already wrote. (See the following link: http://ftbeowulf.wordpress.com/2013/01/09/ubuntu-that-was-friendly/)

Profitt writes that the Ubuntu Friendly project needs volunteers of all technical levels from the Ubuntu community. “There is always a need to have more submissions of laptops and desktops to build the database of equipment that works well with Ubuntu.”

==== Ubuntu phones to come with a terminal—prepare your command line skills ====

Jon Brodkin from Ars Technica gives a preview of a terminal app mockup designed by the Ubuntu design team which provides us with information about its possibilities/features. “The Ubuntu phone operating system will come with a terminal application. That's right: experienced users will have access to the full power of the Linux system running underneath the phone's shiny graphical user interface.”

==== StormFly Wants To Childproof Your Computer With Its Ubuntu-Booting USB Bracelet ====

Chris Velazco of Tech Crunch reports on the Kickstarter project by Barcelona-based Now Computing that uses Ubuntu as a basis for a "childproof" operating system on a USB stick running Ubuntu. "After a little bit of setup (mostly changing the boot sequence in a PC’s BIOS), those little ones whip the USB bracelet off their wrists, plug it into a PC or a Mac, and do whatever it is that kids do on computers these days without having to worry." Velazco also notes that it is something "most of you readers could probably cobble together in under an hour" but that they plan offer a backup and replacement solution with all your data for an additional fee.

Also notable is a comment from Feargal Mac Conuladh, CEO for Now Computing, for more details on changes they've made to make their product more than a standard USB stick with Ubuntu on it.
