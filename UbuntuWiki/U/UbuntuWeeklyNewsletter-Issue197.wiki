==== Kubuntu Council Elections ====

The Kubuntu Council is a group of 6 Kubuntu Members who get to vote on membership to Kubuntu Members and occationally other decisions regarding Kubuntu.

Half the council recently came to the end of their 2 year appointment so we need to hold elections for the open positions to the council. This could be you! If you are a Kubuntu Member and are willing to turn up to Kubuntu meetings as much as possible for the next couple of years do consider putting your name forward.

As well as being into Kubuntu I feel it’s a good idea to have one or more council members who have strong links with upstream KDE so if you are into upstream do consider putting your name forward too.

To put your name forward make sure you update your wiki page then post to this list.

You can also nominate someone else by posting to this list. Might be a good idea to chat to them first of course.

Closing date for nominations is in a week, so Monday 14 June.

The original announcement can be found at:

http://fridge.ubuntu.com/node/2058

==== Ubuntu sparc and ia64 ports ====

Scott James Remnant, on behalf of the Ubuntu Technical Board,sent out the following announcement to the Ubuntu Devel Announce mailing list on June 7th, 2010.

Quality is always important to Ubuntu, and nowhere more so in the ports to alternate architectures. Users using Ubuntu ports should expect the same level of quality and support than they receive from using one of the official architectures.

Unfortunately this means that, from time to time, we have to evaluate the state of each of the ports and some may become candidates for decommissioning.

The Ubuntu SPARC port has been declining in both levels of usage and maintenance, and its quality has now fallen below the minimum level we expect to be an Ubuntu port.

After discussion at the recent Ubuntu Developer Summit, and ratified by the Ubuntu Technical Board, a decision was taken to decommission this port at the Feature Freeze point of Ubuntu 10.10's development later this year.

If Ubuntu users or developers wish this port to continue, they should group together to take over maintenance and ensure that the state is improved above the minimum level before that date. This will almost certainly require substantial work on the toolchain and kernel.

The Ubuntu IA64 port is in a better shape, but has no active maintenance team. We recognise that there are benefits to retaining this port, and that the kernel and toolchain are in better shape, however the Technical Board is concerned that without an active maintenance team the quality will decline rapidly.

Likewise if a maintenance team does not step forward to take over, the port will be decommissioned.

==== Ubuntu 10.04 Release Party at Kanchipuram ====

Shrinivasan talks about the KanchiLUG team having an Ubuntu release party on June 6, 2010, with a vision to share the features of Linux to the general public.  The release party was held at Pachaiyappan Higher Secondary School.  They printed pamphlets and circulated the news via local newspapers.  The Chief Guest of the event was Ramadas (amachu).  The event started at 3:45 p.m. and ran till 6:45 p.m. with talks like History of GNU/Linux, Open source and its concepts, Why Linux, and many other talks.  The Chief Guest, Ramadhas, explained how the proprietary world is making us slaves, the need for Open source, the need for localizations, etc.  He released the Ubuntu CD and the “Ubuntu Manual in Tamil”.  The activities of KanchiLUG were explained and the audience was encouraged to join the mailing list.  Overall, it was a successful gathering with the audience totaling around 75.

==== Sunday Special: Ubuntu Hour ====

The Ubuntu Massachusetts Lo``Co held an Ubuntu Hour on June 6, organised by David Wolfman in Arlington.  They had 10 members show up for this social event and it was very successful.  Martin has a few photos from the event in the blog.

==== Día del usuario Ubuntu ROCKED!!! ====

Efrain Valles had an unusual Día del Usuario Ubuntu in the middle of his sister-in-law’s wedding. He was scheduled to talk about Kubuntu and plasmoids.  He followed most of it through a cellphone.  At the time of his session, he pulled out his laptop, went to the very far side of the ballroom, and connected via his phone to give his talk.  His talk reflected his newly found love for KDE.  Many users, mostly GNOME users were impressed by the idea and he believes this what makes KDE stand out from most desktop experiences.

==== LinuxTag 2010 Ubuntu Berlin Barbeque ====

The Ubuntu Berlin team invited the Linux``Tag 2010 folks over for a BBQ on Saturday, June 12th, after Linux``Tag. This was their annual fourth Linux``Tag-Barbeque. Canonical provided free food (also vegetarian), and drinks were available for purchase at the bar.  They even had free Wireless LAN is available.  Looks like it was a fun time to be held by all.

==== Daniel Holbach: Reviewing 2000 patches ====

Daniel Holbach writes about the ongoing work being done with Operation Cleansweep.

… sounds like a daunting challenge, but actually it’s quite doable, because we’ll be a lot of people and we’ll have help from upstream project and the Debian project to make an informed decision about these fixes.

The goal of Operation Cleansweep is to have a look at all the bugs with patches in Launchpad and guide them through the patch review process. Come, join us in #ubuntu-reviews on irc.freenode.net and help to make all the black go red in the countdown meter.

If you’re not afraid of having a look at patches, trying them and getting in touch with other people about them, this is a fantastic way to get involved!

==== Mackenzie Morgan: "Is Linux Secure?" at Southeast Linux Fest ====

Mackenzie Morgan presented an "Is Linux secure presentation at the Southeast Linus Fest on Saturday, June 12, 2010.  Here is what she had to say about her presentation.

"It's ["Is Linux Secure?" Session] meant to be accessible to normal users or to geeks needing to explain to normal users. I was asked afterward why I didn't talk about buffer overflows. That's easy: normal users can't do anything about them."

=== In The Press ===

==== Dell Says Ubuntu Is Safer Than Windows ====

Joe Panettieri, Works``With``U, updates readers in this article.  Joe states, "In a brief but bold statement, Dell’s U.S. website suggests that Ubuntu is safer than Microsoft Windows, especially for customers looking to avoid viruses. The statement, spotted by TheVARguy.com, also suggests that Dell will begin shipping Ubuntu 10.04 on selected U.S. systems sometime in mid-2010. "

Joe asks in the conclusion of this article, "Is Dell’s statement — suggesting Ubuntu is safer than Windows — really news?" Joe says,  "Perhaps not. But it does take guts for a major PC vendor to endorse Ubuntu at a time when Microsoft is aggressively pushing Windows 7."

==== Ubuntu-Hams - great week, first on-air nets ====

Steven Conklin, Canonical Kernel Team member, discusses the Ubuntu-Hams group in this blog post.

It’s been a great week for the Ubuntu-Hams team. We’ve had a lot of activity on IRC for weeks, but we finally set up some scheduled nets, and had the first of those this week.

Of the four nets on the schedule, we managed to have two - the 80m net ended up moving to 20m because it just wasn’t working for us on 80, and we had a nice round-robin net until the band closed on us. Today we had our first echolink net. There were only two of us, and it was a chance for me to hear the voice of 9W2PJU in Malaysia. Due to his location, power and band limitations, it’s not likely that he and I will be able to make an actual rf contact for a long time.

If you’re an amateur radio operator or want to be, and you are interested in Linux in the ham shack, check out the team page and join us on IRC.

==== Ubuntu In Business ====

The Ubuntu UK community and Canonical, the commercial sponsors of Ubuntu, would like to invite you to a very different type of IT event. The Ubuntu operating system for the desktop and server has made significant inroads into UK businesses over the last 5 years. Often it is driven there by the enthusiasm of individuals from the community who use Ubuntu for their personal computing and see the advantages it can bring to the workplace. This event gives those advocates an opportunity to introduce their colleagues to Ubuntu, Canonical, Partners, community experts and their fellow IT professionals. Attendees will learn how Ubuntu is being deployed in the UK and discover how they can introduce or extend this technology safely and effectively within their organisation.

All are welcome, but if you already count yourself as an Ubuntu user, please drag along a colleague who has yet to see the light!

The Wine 1.2 Release Candidate 3 announcement can be read at WineHQ.org. This next Wine release is due out this month and will be the first major stable update since Wine 1.0 was released two years ago.

==== Canonical Rolling Out Ubuntu Advantage for Enterprise Linux OS ====

Sean Michael Kerner, Server``Watch, discusses a new suport service for Ubuntu Enterprise Users.  This new service, Ubuntu Advantage, is series of support and services offerings for enterprise desktop and server users.

"Ubuntu Advantage replaces other support offerings. It is now our primary services offering," Fern Ho, Canonical's Ubuntu Advantage product manager, told Internet``News.com. "We do however still offer technical consulting and training services in addition to Ubuntu Advantage."

The article goes on, "There is actually no longer the option to purchase Ubuntu support and Landscape separately," Ho said. "As these two services are together critical in ensuring efficient use and management of the Ubuntu platform, we decided to bring them together in a single offering for simplicity."

==== Linaro Tools and Infrastructure Sprint ====

Jamie Bennett discusses the first ever sprint held by the new Linaro Tools and Infrastructure team.
Jamie, notes that "the sprint itself lasts all week but I arranged to be there for just Tuesday and Wednesday to find out what they had planned and to join up with a few guests.

This event is slightly different from what we typically do at Ubuntu sprints. The team hasn’t been together for that long so there was equal focus on both information sharing and collaboration. To that end, mornings were for presentations and discussion, afternoons for hands-on hacking."
