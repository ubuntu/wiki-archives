==== Robie Basak: Continuous integration of your Ubuntu-based server deployments ====

Robie Basak proposes that institutions using continuous integration deployments with Ubuntu keep an eye on the development version of Ubuntu, suggesting: “How about a branch that targets the Ubuntu development release? This way your continuous integration can flag any action you need to take to make your deployment work against the next release (and thus the next LTS, if you deploy on LTS).”

http://www.jonobacon.org/2013/09/21/building-an-ubuntu-app-developer-advocacy-community/

==== Lubuntu Blog: StartUbuntu ====

==== Stephen Michael Kellat: Value of Offline Documentation ====

Stephen Michael Kellat reflects upon the work done on the Xubuntu offline documentation and stresses the importance of putting effort into developing it. Kellat demonstrates: “Offline documentation serves a useful purpose with all of our flavors. The so-called "digital divide" has shifted from being a matter of lacking discrete points of access to the Internet to a marked divergence in the degrees of quality among those access points. When the lights go out for me or my broadband provider has a line cut, having offline documentation is better than having access to nothing at all.”
