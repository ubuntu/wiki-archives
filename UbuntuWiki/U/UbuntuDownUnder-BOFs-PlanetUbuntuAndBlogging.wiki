=== Introduction ===

<nowiki>[[http://planet.ubuntulinux.org|Planet Ubuntu]]</nowiki> is a great way for Ubuntu fans to get to know Ubuntu members through their work and lives. How can we extend our blogging activities to activists, LoCoTeams and the broader Ubuntu user community?

=== Discussion Notes ===

We should make sure that members who have blogs can easily add or remove their feeds from Planet Ubuntu, perhaps through a Launchpad user setting. The Planet Ubuntu feeds configuration should then be automatically generated from this data.

Planet Ubuntu is an English-only planet, so we should make sure other planets exist for other languages. LoCoTeams should have their own planet.ubuntu-LOCO.org sites, with their own standards for who should be on the feed. We should probably have a consistent way to maintain the feed configuration though, perhaps with baz archives, or pulled from each LoCo wiki.

We discussed the use of a centralized blog server for Ubuntu members and users, and settled upon LiveJournal as the most appropriate software to use, considering its features and proven scalability. This is a medium term goal, however, because we can easily aggregate blogs from other services, and we need to choose whether to run our own LiveJournal instance, or partner with LiveJournal to host an Ubuntu branded blog site.

=== Implementation Plan ===

JamesTroup and MatthiasUrlichs to set up a standard way for planet.ubuntu-LOCO.org sites to be maintained and generated.

JeffWaugh to collaborate with Launchpad developers to ensure we can maintain feed urls and so on in Launchpad.

JeffWaugh to contact SixApart/LiveJournal about hosting an Ubuntu branded version of LiveJournal.

=== Outstanding Issues ===

The major issues raised about hosting a blog server included how we handle authentication with Launchpad (especially if it is hosted by another provider), whether we provide blog services to members only, or how to provide the service to Ubuntu users in general.

How can we integrate the blogging service in the Ubuntu desktop? Perhaps provide something like gnome-blog or monkey-journal pre-configured to sign up and use an Ubuntu blog service?
