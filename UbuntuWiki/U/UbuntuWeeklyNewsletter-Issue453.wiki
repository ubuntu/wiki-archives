==== Randall Ross: Have We Converged Yet? ====

Randall Ross shares and reflects on a blog post by “long-time Ubuntu Vancouverite” Wayne who shared his thoughts on Ubuntu’s convergence announcement. He concludes “It's about the agenda that is behind the technology. The friendly folks who make Ubuntu are charting a course in computing that respects people. The Ubuntu Tablet is another way to deliver that goal. That's the real news.”

http://randall.executiv.es/convergence

==== Joe Liau: People = People ====

Joe Liau reflects on a series of definitions around “Ubuntu” and “People” and how they relate to the reasons why we work on building Ubuntu. He writes “When we come together to celebrate Ubuntu, we celebrate the humans who are involved in the project. Our events and attention focus on the people and not just software. This means that we establish environments that allow and encourage people to be people. We don’t get Ubuntu by simply having people there. We get Ubuntu by acknowledging that those people are human beings who are part of the bigger picture.”

=== Other Community News ===

==== Ubuntu Desktop on i386 ====

Dimitri John Ledkov begins a discussion on the ubuntu-devel mailing list about the future of the i386 ISOs for the Ubuntu Desktop. He suggests that “people with i386-only hardware are unlikely to be capable to run Unity 7 Desktop, and probably run other Ubuntu variants“ and proposes ceasing to build, validate and ship the ubuntu-desktop-i386.iso. He proposes: “we should only test the relevant multiarch i386 pieces that are there to support 3rd-party, i386-only apps on amd64 desktop.”

https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2016-February/039161.html
