==== Getting the Ubuntu Advocacy Kit to 1.0 ====

Jono Bacon wishes to get the Ubuntu Advocacy Kit (UAK) to 1.0.  At the virtual UDS, he says it’s not quite complete enough to be useful to teams, and he wants to have the kit available on loco.ubuntu.com in the future. Bacon requests the community to help write some content on quality advocacy “in a concise, simple, but detailed fashion.”

http://www.jonobacon.org/2013/05/16/getting-the-ubuntu-advocacy-kit-to-1-0/

==== Ubuntu Ohio: An Update in Notes ====

Ubuntu Ohio Leader Stephen Michael Kellat reflects on the virtual UDS and announces Ohio Lo``Co’s upcoming projects for Saucy Salamander. The agenda includes preparation for the Ohio Linux Fest, resumption of the Burning Circle Podcast, and contribution to the Ubuntu Advocacy Kit effort. Kellat also writes that “across the planet there are only 784 Ubuntu Members,” he hopes to shepherd community members to Ubuntu members.

==== Raring Party in Barcelona ====

The Catalan Lo``Co team held a Raring Ringtail party at Escola del Clot in Barcelona. 80 people attended the various presentations and installation sessions. The following post includes several photos from this event.

=== The Planet ===

==== Daniel Holbach: Our Community Website ====

Daniel Holbach writes about progress in the new community website which was recently revamped to match the style of the current Ubuntu website but with new community-provided content. He writes that Michael Hall has set up a test instance for the site and would like some feedback from the community before it becomes official.

http://daniel.holba.ch/blog/2013/05/our-community-website/

==== Canonical Design Team: Ubuntu.com update ====

The Canonical Design Team writes about their plans for a new global navigation on Ubuntu.com and across other sites.

http://design.canonical.com/2013/05/ubuntu-com-update/

==== Jono Bacon: Video Demo of Unity 8 on Mir and on a Galaxy Nexus ====

Jono Bacon shows off videos of the Unity 8 phone/tablet code-base running on Mir for both the Galaxy Nexus and a Mac``Book Pro Retina. The videos highlight very early evidence of a smooth user experience, even though it has not yet been through a round of performance optimizations.

http://www.jonobacon.org/2013/05/14/unity-8-running-on-mir-on-a-galaxy-nexus/

==== Kevin DuBois: Friendly Mir Links ====

Kevin Du``Bois provides links to important resources around the Mir display server, including documentation links, code and build information, and coordination help.

http://kdubois.net/?p=1845

==== Jorge Castro: Open Source is not a sport for the armchair quarterback ====

Jorge Castro discusses why Brainstorm may no longer be a relevant tool for the community. Rationale includes making UDS virtual (now everyone has similar access to discussion without traveling), public mailing lists and various other feedback options and the general impression that there are already many ideas being provided by the community and they should seek to focus on implementation rather than providing more.

http://www.jorgecastro.org/2013/05/15/brainstorm-does-not-make-sense-in-the-age-of-virtual-uds/

==== The Fridge: Gandi now offers discounts for Ubuntu Members ====

http://design.canonical.com/2013/05/phone-settings/

==== Rick Spencer: Feel Like Friday (post-vUDS) ====

Rick Spencer writes about his favorite parts of the latest virtual UDS. Topics included a proposal to allow users to choose to be on a rolling release without interrupting the standard release cadence, the Ubuntu status tracker, and getting Unity 8 and Ubuntu Touch into 13.10.

http://theravingrick.blogspot.com/2013/05/feel-like-friday-post-vuds.html

==== Xubuntu: Looking towards Xubuntu 13.10 ====

After three "Nights of Xubuntu", the team presents a quick overview of some of the features and improvements planned for Xubuntu 13.10. They look at the included software, extending the documentation, the role of the community, and discuss how the release schedule may depend upon the release of Xfce 4.12.

http://xubuntu.org/news/looking-towards-xubuntu-13-10/

==== Rick Spencer: Dogfood Update ====

Rick Spencer updates on the “dogfood” effort to allow the Nexus devices to run Ubuntu Touch “exclusively as our phones” by the end of May. Although features like SMS, calling, and wifi are complete, there is still a long way to go.

http://theravingrick.blogspot.com/2013/05/at-end-of-april-we-set-goal-to-have.html

==== Jono Bacon: Dogfooding the Ubuntu Phone: My (Early) Experience ====

As an early tester, Jono Bacon takes a detailed look at what is currently possible with a Galaxy Nexus running Ubuntu Touch. Although he finds a few problems, he concludes progress is looking good and is confident Ubuntu Touch will deliver a far-superior experience to Android on the same device.

http://www.jonobacon.org/2013/05/17/dogfooding-the-ubuntu-phone-my-early-experience/

==== Elizabeth Krumbach Joseph: Virtual Ubuntu Developer Summit 1305 ====

=== In The Press ===

==== Ringtail from scratch ====

Chin Wong at Manila Standard Today looks at installing Ubuntu 13.04 from scratch. He makes a clean installation on his Aspire One netbook to see how well Raring Ringtail performs on a low-powered machine with modest specifications. He also provides ten steps to get it “ready for prime time”.

http://manilastandardtoday.com/2013/05/14/ringtail-from-scratch/

==== Exploring Ubuntu Touch, the other Linux OS for your phone ====

Andrew Cunningham of Ars Technica reports on the status of Ubuntu Touch after a few months into development.  Judging by looks, not by performance, he critiques the OS and concludes that apps get the job done, but are not substantial yet. However, he admits that “it has enough interesting ideas to keep us piqued.”

http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/05/installing-and-exploring-ubuntu-touch-the-other-linux-os-for-your-phone/

==== Google Glass rooted and hacked to run Ubuntu live at Google I/O ====

=== In The Blogosphere ===

==== Ubuntu Strikes Out on Its Own Again ====

Katherine Noyes of Linux``Insider gathers positive and negative feedback from bloggers on Canonical’s independence from tradition F/LOSS projects. She sets the tone of the article in her opening post with following quote from blogger Robert Pogson, “I don't know what's wrong with Canonical. They seem not to understand that GNU/Linux is a cooperative product of the world, and wasting resources to do things differently when existing software is working well is poisoning the well. FLOSS is the right way to do IT, whether as a developer, a distributor,  OEM, retailer or user."

http://www.linuxinsider.com/story/78015.html

==== Ubuntu and the Missing Community Link ====

Bruce Byfield of Datamation takes a look at the missing community link from the Ubuntu website and the problems created by this omission. Byfield cites community members such as Elizabeth Krumbach, Benjamin Kerensa, Mark Terranova, and others. Byfield concludes with from any perspective it’s a problem and writes, “At this point, all that can be safely said is that Ubuntu has community problems, and that past reactions to similar problem do not offer much hope of an amicable solution. But unless one can be found, Ubuntu and Canonical are beginning to look as though they just might stumble before they can manage the last few steps towards success.”

http://www.datamation.com/open-source/ubuntu-and-the-missing-community-link.html

==== Ubuntu SDK Beta Planned For July With New Widgets ====

Michael Larabel of Phoronix takes a look at the Ubuntu Software Development Kit and key takeaways from the Roadmap session held during the Virtual Ubuntu Development Summit last week.

http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTM3MTk

==== Canonical Drives Open Source Innovation with Mir for Ubuntu Linux ====

Christopher Tozzi of the Var Guy takes a look at the role Mir will play in in the greater world of technology. Tozzi writes, “So by implementing Mir, an entirely new display server that Canonical is building from the ground up, Ubuntu developers are doing something radically different. They're bringing a crucial part of the open source ecosystem into the modern age, creating a display system tailored to work well on the types of hardware—especially phones and tablets—that will define the future.”

==== Chromium Likely to Replace Firefox As Default Browser in Ubuntu 13.10 ====

Joey-Elijah Sneddon of OMG! Ubuntu! reports that Ubuntu 13.10 is likely to ship with Chromium as the default web browser due to greater usage than Firefox and a clear demand from Chromium users.

http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2013/05/chromium-to-replace-firefox-as-default-browser-in-ubuntu

==== New tablet boots Ubuntu Linux, Android, and Windows 8 ====

Katherine Noyes of PCWorld reports on the Python S3 “a tablet released on Monday by Italian Ekoore that can boot three operating systems: Ubuntu Linux, Android, and Windows 8.” Koyes writes that it has a 11.6 inch display and “is available in Italy for about 599 Euros, or $770 in the United States.”

http://www.pcworld.com/article/2038859/new-tablet-boots-ubuntu-linux-android-and-windows-8.html

==== What to Expect from Unity in Ubuntu 13.10 ====

Based on developer discussions, Joey-Elijah Sneddon of OMG! Ubuntu! takes a look at what we might expect from Unity in Ubuntu 13.10. Features include Smart Scopes Service/100 Scopes, in-Dash payments, new ‘Unity Indicators’, and newer Compiz with performance improvements.
