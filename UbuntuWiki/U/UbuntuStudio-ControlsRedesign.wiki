== Ubuntu Studio Controls Redesign ==

=== Summary ===
The Ubuntu Studio Controls package (ubuntustudio-controls) was developed to help users make system changes to improve audio performance.  Over time some of the specifications for those changes have either changed or no longer exist.  Additionally, there are some additional functionality that has been proposed as well.

Therefore, this specification has been developed to facilitate the immediate development of changes for release in Natty as well as future changes in later releases.  You can find the blueprint at: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntustudio-controls/+spec/update-and-add-functionality-in-ubuntustudio-controls/

All decisions should be considered from the perspective of a user installing ubuntustudio-* packages on top of a vanilla Ubuntu install as well as a user completing a fresh install from a Ubuntu Studio DVD.

=== Changes for Natty ===
There are changes required to fix items that are currently broken and changes that we feel are release critical (RC) for user experience.

==== Fix Broken Items ====
Two major items have broken a few items: JACK handling real-time privileges differently and the new the new FireWire kernel driver stack (alias Juju).

We will need to make changes for:
* making changes for ''memlock'' and ''rtprio'' in /etc/security/limits.d/audio.conf now (was /etc/security/limits.conf)
* do NOT set or adjust ''nice'' anymore
* do NOT set or adjust ''raw1394'' privileges TODO: CHECK TO MAKE SURE THIS IS CORRECT

==== Improve User Experience ====
* tuned kernel
** check if tuned kernel is installed
** warn user if not
** if desired add PPA, install -lowlatency/-rt kernel, reboot
* user in audio group
** check if user is in audio group
** warn user if not
** if desired add user to audio group
