==== Ubuntu 22.10 (Kinetic Kudu) End of Life reached on July 20, 2023 ====

Whilst this shouldn't be news to anyone, Utkarsh Gupta publishes a "follow-up" to the prior End of Life warning; readers should know if they're still using Ubuntu 22.10 that it's unsupported and hasn't received upgrades since 20 July 2023. Links on upgrading to Ubuntu 23.04 (Lunar) are provided, and a warning that the repository will be moved to old-releases.

==== Updating snaps after Mir release ====

Alan Griffiths reminds us that there are a number of snaps built using Mir libraries, and automation is in place to rebuild & test these. This page documents much of this process, including detail on promoting to stable - 22/candidate. Alan makes this a “call for testing”.

https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/updating-snaps-after-mir-release/37218

==== Community contributions to the documentation ====

Cristovao Cordeiro adds a Rocks page that will be helpful for community contributions to Rockcraft. In case you're not sure what Rocks/rockcraft is, it's the "world’s best portfolio and community for production-grade OCI-compliant container images".

https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/community-contributions-to-the-documentation/37324

==== Create an Ubuntu LoCo Team ====

Aaron Prisk writes a documentation page telling us how to create a Ubuntu Lo``Co Team. We're walked through a number of steps that should be completed, with clues as to what resources may be required and some of the options that exist.

https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/create-an-ubuntu-loco-team/37342

==== Ubuntu AI podcast ====

Andreea Munteanu introduces us to a new podcast "on open source, machine learning and levelling the playing field for data-driven innovation". We're told it's a podcast where the talk will be about "artificial intelligence, open source tooling, machine learning operations and the future of innovation". The podcast will be every second week, with episode 1 including Andreea Munteanu, Canonical’s AI/ML Product Manager, and co-host Maciej Mazur, Principal AI/ML Engineer.

==== Canonical launches Real-time Ubuntu on Intel Core processors ====

Maria Deutscher reports on the collaboration between Canonical Ltd. and Intel Corp that makes "Real-Time Ubuntu generally available on the Intel Core portfolio of central processing units". The benefits of running the RT kernel are presented and why such a kernel is needed - designed to power time-sensitive systems.

==== Latest version of Canonical's Wayland compositor arrives ====

Liam Proven writes briefly about the history of the Mir display server. We're told it's used in several IoT product lines, the Lomiri desktop (natively runs on Debian 12), before telling us Mir 2.14 is out. We're reminded 2.14 means it's version 14 of Mir 2, with Mir 2 being the pure Wayland Compositor (or more correctly "set of libraries for handling Wayland compositors", quoting Alan Griffiths). This detailed post gives good coverage of Mir particularly as used by Ubuntu Frame, Lomiri, and Mirway.

=== In the Blogosphere ===

==== Ubuntu 23.10 Will Use Linux 6.5 Kernel ====

Joey Sneddon tells us Ubuntu 23.10 will come with the Linux 6.5 kernel. We're reminded current dailies still have the 6.3 kernel, with 6.5 due out in "mid to late August".

https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2023/07/ubuntu-23-10-linux-6-5-kernel

==== AMD Zenbleed chip bug leaks secrets fast and easy ====

Jessica Lyons Hardcastle alerts us to AMD patches that address a problem dubbed 'Zenbleed'. We're told how it can be exploited if left unpatched on a vulnerable system, what systems are impacted, including that elevated privileges are not required. We're told it was found by Tavis Ormandy back in May, and is addressed by microcode updates, thus update your systems asap. A link to the AMD advisory is provided.

==== New OpenSSH Vulnerability Exposes Linux Systems to Remote Command Injection ====

This post discusses CVE-2023-38408 which has recently received patching impacting all versions of OpenSSH before 9.3p2. Details are provided.

==== Wiz researchers discovered two Linux vulnerabilities in the Ubuntu kernel that can allow an unprivileged local user to gain elevated privileges. ====

Pierluigi Paganini writes about CVE-2023-2640 and CVE-2023-32629 which impact the OverlayFS module in Ubuntu. We're told the OverlayFS changes were introduced in 2018, however later in 2019 & 2022, changes in the upstream Linux kernel 'conflicted' creating the problem. We're given details of the different security threats offered by the problems, a link to Ubuntu's security advisory (which covers eight issues including these two) and told fixes have been released.

==== GNOME Devs Are Working on a New Window Management System ====

Marius Nestor blogs about Tobias Bernard's presentation at GUADEC 2023 which showcased a new window management system for GNOME. Marius discusses this change, including some GNOME videos which give us a 'taste'. Marius provides a link to Tobias' blog, and a reminder it's still an idea at this point.

==== Ubuntu Portugal Podcast: 257 - O Diogo Errou ====

"Choque. Surpresa. Consternação. O Diogo errou; e como é um bom rapaz, educado com fervor religioso, ajoelhou-se e pediu penitência perante os patronos. Estes olharam de soslaio, desconfiados. O Miguel iniciou a homilia com vinho verde branco (não havia tinto) e para acompanhar, uma salada de sistemas operativos: Blend OS - o que será? Para a sobremesa, vergastaram as nalgas a um Lama e claro, ainda trouxeram notícias de Ubuntu Pro e esclareceram toda a polémica com LXD, entre outras novidades da agenda com pequeno-almoço incluído."
