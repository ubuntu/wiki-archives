==== Contributing without Code ====

Alan Pope remembers CIX in the mid-90s, and his first taste of helping people online. When Alan started using Ubuntu, this help switched to Launchpad Answers, then to Ask Ubuntu. Alan tells us how it makes you feel good to help users, and that all of us have that capacity to help others newer in their Ubuntu journey, or stuck with problems you may have already faced, and how these contributions can be done, even by people who don't code.
