=== Setting the Jabber Server on Ubuntu Sugar Remix ===

Sugar uses an <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMPP|XMPP]]</nowiki> (aka Jabber) server to network between activities.  Here is how to set
the jabber server that Sugar is uses:

0. Open the "My Settings" screen:
     <nowiki>[[File:usr_jabber1.png]]</nowiki>
0. Select "Network":
     <nowiki>[[File:usr_jabber2.png]]</nowiki>
0. Change the "Server:" setting:
     <nowiki>[[File:usr_jabber3.png]]</nowiki>
0. Click the check mark:
     <nowiki>[[File:usr_jabber4.png]]</nowiki>
0. Click the X:
     <nowiki>[[File:usr_jabber5.png]]</nowiki>

That's it!  When you visit your network neighbourhood, you should now see the other users who are connected to the same server as you are.
