Kernel testing is done to assure we get the desired performance for our workflows.

For approximate dates, see <nowiki>[[UbuntuStudio-DevEvents-Testing]]</nowiki>

=== Kernel Version Testing ===

Each time a new version is uploadeded (3.18, 3.19) we need to test it.

=== Final Testing ===

This is done after KernelFreeze to assure everything is fine with the kernel.
