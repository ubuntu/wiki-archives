==== Announcing Ubuntu Core, with snappy transactional updates! ====

Mark Shuttleworth announces a new "snappy" image called Ubuntu Core which uses the same technology as Ubuntu phone in that an update applies perfectly or not at all. He says that it is called "snappy" because it uses a new mechanism for app delivery and system updates which is completely different to Ubuntu server and desktop. Mark ends his announcement with: "Welcome to the family, Ubuntu Core!"

=== The Planet ===

==== Daniel Holbach: Foundation or no foundation ====

Daniel Holbach writes that the call for an Ubuntu Foundation has come up again and questions which problems it would solve. He says that Ubuntu's success is tied to Canonical's success and that adding a new layer will bring "incredible amounts of work" but not fix Ubuntu's problems.

==== Ali Jawad: StartUbuntu Leadership & My Ultimate Goal ====

Ali Jawad looks back at the Start``Ubuntu project which he started in April 2013, noting the lack of contributions, the lack of interest from magazines, the continued use of Windows XP, and that it is not a one-man project. He says: "Let’s share the leadership of Start``Ubuntu and let’s move forward." In a follow-up post, Ali links to several other Ubuntu related projects that he is involved with.

https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-news-team/2014-December/002122.html

=== In The Blogosphere ===

==== Linux Mobile-Desktop Convergence ====

Matt Hartley of Datamation examines the areas that need to come together in order for Linux Mobile-Desktop convergence to be widely accepted. He doubts that anyone is going to dump their existing financial investment in iOS or Android to move to another platform "all in the name of convergence."

http://www.datamation.com/open-source/linux-mobile-desktop-convergence.html 

==== Ubuntu Developer Tools Center Gets Renamed To Ubuntu Make ====

Michael Larabel of Phoronix writes that the Ubuntu Developer Tools Center, a project to allow easy installation of common developer tools, has been renamed to Ubuntu Make. 

http://www.phoronix.com/vr.php?view=MTg1ODA

http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2014/12/modular-smartphone-ara-rival-ubuntu-touch 

==== Ubuntu 15.04 To Soon Land The Linux 3.18 Kernel ====

Michael Larabel of Phoronix reports that the Linux 3.18 kernel has been released and that it should be landing in the Ubuntu 15.04 archive soon. He says that the new version brings many new features but by the time 15.04 is released, Ubuntu 15.04 will likely have switched to 3.19.

http://www.phoronix.com/vr.php?view=MTg1ODg 

==== UT One Ubuntu Tablet Delayed; Rooted Android Device May Come Instead ====

Christopher Tozzi of The VAR Guy, reports that The Demski Group has announced the UT One, an Ubuntu-based mobile device has been delayed and that the company may be releasing a hacker-friendly Android tablet instead. He says: “The catch, however, is that the tablet the Demski Group is now working on will run Android by default, so users would have to install Ubuntu on it themselves.”

http://thevarguy.com/ubuntu/121114/ut-one-ubuntu-tablet-delayed-rooted-android-device-may-come-instead 

==== Ubuntu 15.04 to Include GNOME 3.14, Updates to Default Apps ====
