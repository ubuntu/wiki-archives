==== Xubuntu: My media manager: gmusicbrowser ====

The Xubuntu team reminds us that Xubuntu 16.04 LTS is the first Xubuntu release without a default media manager. In the next article in this series about media managers, members of the Xubuntu team talk about their use of gmusicbrowser and why it’s the best choice for them.

==== Sam Hewitt: What's up with Unity 7? ====

Sam Hewitt writes about Unity’s new feature in the upcoming 16.04 to move the launcher to the bottom of the screen. He accepts that the developers have responded to requests from users who wanted this feature, even though he believes it  is“very odd to suddenly give users an option that lets them alter the UI so dramatically.” He concludes by Including the terminal command to move the launcher.

http://samuelhewitt.com/blog/2016-04-06-whats-up-with-unity-7-on-ubuntu

==== Stéphane Graber: LXC 2.0 has been released! ====

Stephanie Graber announces the release of LXC 2.0, the second Long Term Support Release. “LXC 2.0,” he says, “is the result of a year of work by the LXC community with over 700 commits done by over 90 contributors.” He explains that it joins LXCFS 2.0, which just came out last week and it will very soon join LXD 2.0 to complete its collection of 2.0 container management tools. "It will still support all kernels from 2.6.32, though the exact feature set does obviously vary based on kernel features," states Graber. He concludes by also sharing that LXC 2.0 support was greatly improved for a bunch of architectures, a plethora of bugs were fixed, and other rough edges were polished.

==== Simon Quigley: Contributing to Ubuntu - 0 - What is this? ====

Simon Quigley introduces a new blog series that he is working on to help people start contributing to Ubuntu. He says, “I plan on creating a series of blog posts in the next couple of months covering the forms of contributions I have personally participated in, and possibly a few interviews from some Ubuntu community members about their contributions.” He invites anybody with ideas for content to cover to leave a comment on that page.

http://tsimonq2.net/blog/2016/04/06/

==== Dustin Kirkland: Container MacCloud: Can there really only be one? ====

Dustin Kirkland uses references from Highlander to talk about the various types of containers available today for Ubuntu and shares various links talking about the use in development and production. He concludes with plans to attend the upcoming Open``Stack Summit ("The Gathering") and invites readers to view an upcoming webinar on "Discover the Cloud and Scale Out World of Ubuntu on IBM."

http://blog.dustinkirkland.com/2016/04/container-maccloud.html

==== Colin Watson: No more “Hash Sum Mismatch” errors ====

Colin Watson summarizes some updates to the way that the Ubuntu and Debian archives work, showing the steps that built up to the recent change in the design of the repositories. Colin says, "The solution we’ve ended up with, thanks to Michael Vogt’s work implementing it in APT, is called by-hash and should be familiar in concept to people who’ve used git: with the exception of the top-level In``Release file, index files for suites that support the by-hash mechanism may now be fetched using a URL based on one of their hashes listed in In``Release.” He points out that this is currently only supported for Xenial, as “earlier versions of Ubuntu don’t have the necessary support in APT. With this, hash mismatches on updates should be a thing of the past."

==== Michael Hall: New Ubuntu Community Donations report ====

Michael Hall publishes the Community Donations report for Q3 2015. Everybody who has received these funds have used them to contribute to the Ubuntu project. The Ubuntu Community Donations Fund is regularly paying out more than it is getting in donations. Michael Hall writes: "If you like the things we’ve been able to support with this program, please consider sending it a contribution and helping us spread the word about it."

He talks about the growth, customization and improved usability of Ubuntu, and concludes: “Ubuntu is growing, Linux is growing and with it my opinions of the OS are changing. If you want to break free from the monotony of Windows, try Ubuntu 15.10. It’s not as complex as it was before and with a little tweaks here and there, it looks amazing.”

She goes on to discuss Canonical’s plans for the Internet of Things using Snappy Ubuntu Core. The article concludes by asking him if he’d consider going to Mars, to which he respons “Yes, I would. Why not? In 20 years, a one-way ticket could be a perfectly plausible last hurrah. Frontiers are fascinating. There are ecosystems there we have to more respectful of them, certainly more respectful then we have to our own. You have to dial it up to 11 and hope for the best. Going to Mars is dialling it up to 11.”

He concludes by sharing his thoughts about how it can be improved further, “In all, this update brings Ubuntu’s fuzzy attempt at adding social cool into sharper focus. It’s not perfect but it is a big improvement over that which it replaces.”

==== Meet the brand new Ubuntu Software Center in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS ====

This article by Manual Rose covers the GNOME Software Center that replaced the Ubuntu Software Center for 16.04. “I was so excited to see the "new" Software Center in 16.04 that I didn't even check it twice. Canonical completely scrapped the Ubuntu Software Center it seems,” stated Rose. He writes that one of the things you will notice is the different layout of the GNOME Software Center compared to the Ubuntu Software Center. Rose continues by pointing out that the GNOME Software Center is incredibly more responsive, saying that it “feels feather light, and that is going to do a world of good for new Ubuntu users who are probably the primary target of latest Software Center improvements.”

==== Canonical Releases Snapcraft 2.7 Snappy Creator Tool for Ubuntu Snappy 16.04 LTS ====
