==== Big Bug Bonanza Ubuntu 16.04 LTS ====

Will Cooke describes how most users stick to LTS versions, and that over the years bug lists have grown to become unmanageable. To ensure developer’s time is spent on the important current bugs, Will outlines a proposal to cut down the bug-list to size. Critical bugs will be reviewed, but most for unsupported releases of Ubuntu will be closed by robot. Will Cooke further highlights where you can most help, in “triaging” or trying to reproduce bugs in 15.10. How to help is explained, and programming skills are not required.

==== Landing team 17.09.15 ====

Łukasz Zemczak reports the work done by the Ubuntu Touch developers on the upcoming major software update of Ubuntu Touch, OTA-7. Work includes a new Unity8, updated version of unity-scopes-click and pay-service and a fix for a regression introduced by the libusermetrics library.  Also, Łukasz informs us that investigation of the various phone slowness issues continues: "It looks like the overall problem is a combination of many many smaller problems. Not sure if all of those can be resolved by OTA-7 - fingers crossed".

=== Canonical News ===

==== The future of access networks ====

Maarten Ectors writes about how Google & co seem to have their eye set to take over the telecom business. Telecoms businesses though have users who want more data, but to pay less, with few (or no) phone calls or SMS. IoT promises to be a data tsunami but only trickle desired revenue. Maarten equates the traditional telecoms business to like an old Nokia handset; strong & dependable, but the industry has changed. Maarten explores the many facets of the telecoms industry including CPEs (cheap on-premise equipment), parental control, apps, wifi, DSLAMs (broadband), to phones and tablets, finally linking it with Ubuntu Core.

==== Ubuntu nominated in V3 Technology Awards shortlist; cast your vote! ====

==== dConstruct 2015 ====

Jamie Young writes about dConstruct held in Brighton (UK) recently of which Ubuntu was a premier sponsor. Jamie's post contains several photos, and includes details of a popular origami competition in which the winner received a BQ Aquaris E5 Ubuntu phone.

http://design.canonical.com/2015/09/dconstruct-2015/

=== In The Blogosphere ===

==== Fairphone ‘Exploring’ Switch to Ubuntu Touch ====

Joey-Elijah Sneddon of OMG! Ubuntu! writes that the Fairphone 1 handset was affected by the Stagefright Android vulnerability uncovered earlier this year and that fixing the vulnerability was not easy to achieve because of licensing and vendor restrictions. He says to remedy that, Fairphone is "exploring the possibility of replacing the Android software by alternative operating systems (Ubuntu/Firefox/Jolla) in an effort to prolong the life of the device.”

http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2015/09/fairphone-is-exploring-a-switch-to-ubuntu-touch

==== Ubuntu Linux-Based Open Source OS Runs 42 Percent of Dell PCs in China ====

Christopher Tozzi, The VAR Guy, writes that Dell have reported that 42% of the PCs that it sells in China run a variant of Ubuntu that Canonical has helped to develop, i.e. Ubuntu Kylin. He says that Ubuntu Kylin uses the Unity interface but the default theme used make it look more like Windows. Christopher adds that Dell’s comment on their Chinese sales follows an announcement of a US $125 million investment in China.

http://thevarguy.com/open-source-application-software-companies/091515/ubuntu-linux-based-open-source-os-runs-42-percent-dell-pc

Softpedia, PCWorld and Phoronix also had articles about this new statistic:
* Dell Reportedly Shipping Ubuntu-Based Linux On 40%+ Of PCs In China  - http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Dell-China-40-Linux
* It's the year of the Linux desktop, for Dell, in China - http://www.pcworld.com/article/2984194/operating-systems/its-the-year-of-the-linux-desktop-for-dell-in-china.html
* Dell Reporting That 40% of PCs Sold in China Are Ubuntu-Powered - http://news.softpedia.com/news/dell-reporting-that-40-of-pc-sold-in-china-are-ubuntu-powered-491666.shtml

==== Ubuntu Phone Will Skip 15.10 ====

Marius Nestor of Softpedia shares the news that the Ubuntu Touch developers have no plans to switch from the stable Ubuntu 15.04 base and quotes Łukasz Zemczak as saying the 15.10 will be skipped. He also quotes another developer as saying: “There is a growing concern, however, that the lack of attention to Wily will hit us hard (w/ compounded interest) when we want to switch off of Vivid." Marius sees Canonical as considering the upcoming LTS as a good candidate for the next stable version of Ubuntu Touch and that they will soon start looking for an upgrade path.

==== Ubuntu 15.10 (Wily Werewolf) to Be the Last "Boring" Release ====

Silviu Stahie of Softpedia writes that Ubuntu 15.10 which is scheduled to launch on October 22nd will be the last release that users will be able to say is no different from its predecessor. He says that while the next release will ship with Unity 7 Canonical is doing its best to offer Unity 8 as an alternative. He ends his post by saying: “that should make the new LTS a very exciting version.”

http://news.softpedia.com/news/ubuntu-15-10-wily-werewolf-will-be-the-last-boring-release-491965.shtml

==== New Ubuntu Store Makes It Easier to Buy Ubuntu Laptops, PCs and Phones ====

Joey-Elijah Sneddon of OMG! Ubuntu! reports that Canonical has opened a new “brand store” in conjunction with Snapdeal, India’s biggest online retailer. He says: “In launching an Ubuntu Store on Snapdeal Canonical not only makes it easier for Ubuntu enthusiasts in India to see, compare and buy Ubuntu laptops and PCs, but makes it easier for its hardware partners to their promote devices to potential customers.”

==== Intel Graphics Installer for Linux Adds Support for Ubuntu 15.04 ====

Joey-Elijah Sneddon of OMG! Ubuntu! writes that the new release of the Intel Graphics Installer now supports Ubuntu 15.04 and that support for Ubuntu 14.10 has been dropped. He says that 15.04 users can use the tool and download the latest Intel Graphics Stack.

==== Meet The New Ubuntu 15.10 Default Wallpaper ====

Joey-Elijah Sneddon of OMG! Ubuntu! shares a screenshot with us of the new default wallpaper for Ubuntu 15.10. He says that although the new wallpaper hasn’t been packaged and uploaded to the archive yet, those using 15.10 can download the wallpaper from the link that he provides.
