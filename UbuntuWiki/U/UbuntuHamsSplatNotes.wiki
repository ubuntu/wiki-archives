__TOC__

== SPLAT ==

SPLAT is a very useful application used to predict propagation at frequencies from 20 MHz to 20 GHz.

The splat web site <nowiki>[[http://www.qsl.net/kd2bd/splat.html|is here]]</nowiki>

=== Packaging ===

Splat version 1.3.0 has not yet been packaged for Debian or Ubuntu.

Packaging is problematic for the following reasons:
* Building splat is done by shell scripts and not makefiles
* There are interactive decisions requested which determine how splat is built
* These build-time decisions affect the terrestrial range that splat can be used for
 
=== Installation ===

Installation is challenging because the user is required to download, unpack, process,
and install a lot of required terrain data in order to use splat.

=== Wish List for Splat ===

* convert all build-time decisions to run-time decisions
* convert to makefile builds
* A utility is needed to download and process the appropriate data files. This could be implemented as a google-maps type process, where the location and simulation range are used to determine which terrain data to download.
