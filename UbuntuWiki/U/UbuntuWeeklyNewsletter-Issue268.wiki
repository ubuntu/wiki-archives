=== Launchpad News ===

==== Bug Linking Part 1 ====

Curtis Hovey of the Launchpad team discusses the current state of bug linking and writes “Launchpad has always recognized that a bug can affect many project and packages.” He notes problems which occur when considering bugs: bug fixing problems - one bug affects a lot of projects but linkage is the issue; bug visibility problems - public/private; duplicate  problems. Due to these issues, “Launchpad team is planning a new feature that will allow someone to link bugs to each other and describe their relationship. The general idea is that person can say one bug depends of the fix of another.”

http://blog.launchpad.net/general/bug-linking-part-1

==== A story of a clinic ====

Graham Binns shares his experience with the Launchpad clinic session which was held at UDS-Q. The Launchpad clinic sessions are there for discussing improving work at Launchpad, lessons learned, and lessons that are yet to be learned. He describes the first day of the clinic as busy and got “a bit fuzzy, because I was always answering someone’s question or being root on an EC2 instance for someone else. When Laura told us that our time was up I was, I have to confess, somewhat surprised.” In all Binns reports that the event was “massively positive” and “a genuine development community out there for Launchpad, and people really are keen to make changes.”

==== Jono Bacon: Ubuntu Accomplishments Web Gallery: Django Developers Needed and Ask Ubuntu Documentation Needed ====

Jono Bacon puts out a call for volunteers for two sections of his Ubuntu Accomplishments project. First, he wants to bring Ubuntu Accomplishments to the web, saying that the “idea is that a user can voluntarily show their accomplishments online. When this is enabled you can browse all of their accomplishments on one page.” Therefore he calls Django developers to involve with project and help out. Secondly, he has a plan to “get Ask Ubuntu accomplishments into the 0.2. version of Ubuntu Accomplishments which release is planned for the next week.” Due to that, he calls for help with the documentation. Jono stated: “While we have all the Ask Ubuntu accomplishments working and all the tests written, we still need help to get the documentation written for all the badges.”

=== In Other News ===

==== Is Xfce a GNOME and Unity Replacement? ====

Bruce Byfield of Datamation reviews features in the latest release of Xfce, 4.10, including moving local help files online, changes to the Thunar file manager, extra rows available for the panel, the new settings manager, and more. Byfield goes on to ask “To what extent is the latest version of Xfce an alternative for those who miss GNOME 2?” and concludes “Xfce is not splashy. In places, it is almost old-fashioned or crude. But in the end, what really matters for most users is that, as the release notes and tour for the 4.10 release make clear, Xfce is concerned with providing what its users request. It's an attitude that many feel is rare among Linux desktop alternatives today.”
