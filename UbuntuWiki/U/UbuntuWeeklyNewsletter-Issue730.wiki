Michał Sawicz makes a 'call for testing' for ubuntu-frame 60-mir2.7.0 which contains "the hardware-observe interface auto-connected to avoid high volume of logs from libinput". It is noted that this "should not affect existing usage". The command to install it is provided, and we're told it's expected to be promoted to stable in a week's time.

==== Ubuntu 22.04 has arrived and it's one of the best releases from Canonical yet ====

Jack Wallen starts by telling us that Linux desktop use continues to grow, and Ubuntu is part of the reason why. We are told that Ubuntu 22.04 LTS is currently in beta testing, and is scheduled for release on 21 April 2022, and is a long-term-support release. We are told it contains GNOME 42 and given some reasons as to why it's special, including showing us some pictures. We are reminded libadwaita is replacing libhandy and what this may mean, before the post moves to Core App changes. Jack concludes that he has found it one of "best releases to come from Canonical".

==== The next major Ubuntu release is here, with a bunch of handy upgrades ====

Sead Fadilpašić reports that Ubuntu 22.04 LTS is available for download as a beta product. We are told it contains GNOME 42 with Libadwaita support; with a reminder that that is a replacement for the GTK3-based libhandy library. Next we are told it contains a "performance boost" due to triple frame buffering, has hardware accelerated browsing with GNOME web browser, and the 5.15 linux kernel. Links are provided.

Marius Nestor gives us the March 2022 "Xfce's Apps Update“ which includes the news that Orange 4.16 is out with the Xfce calendar app now fully GTK3, with a new icon as well as some bug fixes. We are told the Global``Time and Orage panel plugins are now deprecated and planned for removal.

A link to the official mailing list provided for additional details.

==== Linux's Speculation Handling Was Messed Up After Resuming From Suspend For Boot CPU ====

Michael Larabel reports on a fix related to systems resuming from S3 suspend and restoration of the "MSRs for the boot CPU around handling speculative execution mitigations". Michael explains the vulnerability this caused that has now been addressed with the fix hitting Linux 5.18 on Git. The fix is "marked for back-porting to currently supported Linux stable kernels".

https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Linux-Resume-Spec-Boot-CPU

==== Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Ready With Mesa 22.0, Early Intel Arc Graphics Enabled & Amber Added ====

Michael Larabel writes that Ubuntu 22.04 LTS has "transitioned from the former Mesa 21.3 series to Mesa 22.0" for open-source OpenGL/Vulkan drivers. Michael further adds Mesa 22.0.1 is in the Jammy archive with a patch for enabling Intel DG2/Alchemist discrete GPU PCI IDs to provide support for Intel's Arc Graphics with Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Desktop. Michael expresses an opinion that whilst many patches are backported; support may still be better using a 5.17 or 5.18 kernel, but we'll have to wait and see if that's the case. Other Mesa changes are mentioned, with links provided for more details.

==== Dash to Panel Adds GNOME 42 Support ====

Joey Sneddon reports that Dash to Panel now supports GNOME 42, which means it's usable in Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. We are reminded what the extension does, and Joey adds it runs well on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS beta, before noting the extension can't currently be added through the firefox snap. So if you want to try it out, Joey suggests the Extensions Manager. Joey adds the Ubuntu team is working on fixing the firefox gnome extensions regression.

==== Upgrading from Ubuntu 20.04? Look Out for These Features in 22.04 ====

Joey Sneddon reminds us Ubuntu 22.04 LTS release is getting close, and includes the benefits found in Ubuntu 20.10, Ubuntu 21.04 & Ubuntu 21.10. Joey notes a total of 20 new features, changes and improvements we'll see in Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. A summary of each of the twenty changes is provided, along with screen images for us to look at, before noting there are more improvements than just the twenty Joey has chosen to highlight.
