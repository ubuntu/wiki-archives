== Suggestions from users to developers ==

=== What's about ===

This page is for making suggestions or wishlists of aspects that users think that should be (/were useful to be) in the next release of Ubuntu (Breezy).

Please put here non-trivial suggestions (if you want to do that, put in TrivialUserSuggestions), else a wishlists of aspects that users will thank very much in the next release (Breezy) and 
why these aspect are good for implement

=== Suggestions ===

 1. '''Suggestion''': Modify apt-get for not spend all the bandwith of the computer

   '''Situation''': When apt-get dist-upgrade or apt-get install <anything> is running, apt-get spends all the bandwith of the computer if not QoS is not installed in system (that is a difficult thing to do for non-expert users).

   '''Why it helps''': If we use update-manager and if we want to navigate we can't do that. Special atention when in update-manager we mark "upgrade automatically". In this situation, we can't navigate (or another interner related things) for this thing, and so (at least for desktop user) it's no sense no having internet connection until update-manager upgrades the system.

   '''Comments''':
       1. Is it there a formal bug (what number?) for this?

 1. '''Suggestion''': Make a netinstall CD

   '''Situation''': Now we haven't it.

   '''Why it helps''': Useful for people who:
*** have low bandwith and spends days for downloading CD.iso
*** have old computers and they will not install the majorty of software (only non-X soft)
*** want to install all the newest software from internet (so they want that installer downloads the software they need and install)
*** for betatesters?
   '''Comments''':
### Available at: http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/hoary/main/installer-i386/current/images/netboot/
### Is it "official"?. If it's, why it isn't in releases.ubuntu.com or in cdimages.ubuntu.com?

 1. '''Suggestion''': Put symbolic link into repository (like debian unstable)

   '''Situation''': Now we haven't it. So if we want to have the latest development version, we have change it manually.

   '''Why it helps''': People who want have always the development branch, have not to change manually after every release (after Hoary, Breezy, ...).
    The name?:
**** ubuntu-dev-branch (from "development branch" the title that have hoary array CD's at the boot)
**** ubuntu-unstable (like Debian)
**** will it be actually "grumpy"?

 1. '''Suggestion''': Help "upgrading" from Debian to Ubuntu

   '''Situation''': Now we haven't it.

   '''Why it helps''': Useful for people who:
*** have Debian installed and would like to upgrade to Ubuntu without complete re-installation
   '''Comments''':
### Debian users are a huge crowd of people who already know the debian tools and potentially would be interested in the slickness of Ubuntu's desktop.
### It might help the cross-fertilization of packages between Debian and Ubuntu.
### As a Debian Sarge desktop user myself, I see great advantage if I could upgrade to Ubuntu and then keep updating my packages from both Ubuntu and Debian repositories (the later is something I heard to be possible for people who installed Ubuntu from scratch). But right now, as much as I'd like to use Ubuntu's slick GNOME 2.10 desktop, I am not willing to re-install it over my single-partition Debian machine.

*** Reply to Amo's: Sorry if I don't understand you, but if you change the sources in apt, and run apt-get upgrade you pass from Debian to Ubuntu. Is it not what you refers? (Xan)
*** Reply to Xan's question - from what I learned so far it won't work and will break your Debian installation horribly. I startted looking for this option because I wanted Ubuntu's Gnome 2.10 on top of my Debian Sarge and found questions from others who asked about this and got strict replies not to attempt this since it will leave them with very broken systems. I also asked myself and got the same reply about the latest versions of Ubuntu and Sarge. (Amos)
*** Reply to Amo's answer: Okay. I understand it now. I thinked that the migration process was good. Sorry for obvious question. (Xan).

 1. '''Suggestion''': Installer could have an user-friendly option to select between Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Edubuntu, Xubuntu, etc.

   '''Situation''': Now it is possible to make a server install then install yout favorite version from the CLI, but that's not user-friendly. Point in question is to make it easier to avoid installing unnecessary stuff.

   '''Why it helps''': It helps because:
*** Having only one CD one can ''easily'' install different versions.
*** Possibly helps releasing a netboot install cd.
*** Possibly people would stop asking how to install another version :)

   '''How it could work''': When installing from an Ubuntu CD, user is prompted to install Ubuntu (default) or Other. If Other is chosen, the list with available options appears (Kubuntu, Xubuntu, etc - maybe with a little description) and the user is informed that the missing packages would have to be downloaded (w/ estimated size and time). It could have a Server option as well.

   That pretty much covers the idea. Ubuntu CDs have ubuntu-desktop packages, Kubuntu ones have kubuntu-desktop, etc, and the netboot (or Server) would have none. And all of them would ask nicely if the user wants to install that CD's default or another version (at the smaller cost of downloading the packages instead of download and burn another cd or asking for help to install another version).

=== Questions ===

1. What's the policy of permisions of personal directories?
   What's the default permisions for personal directories in /home?. Can anyone view/modify/create a file in another home directory?. Have you thought in that regarding security topic?

=== Other ===

1. Perhaps, if you have to want to build your modifications of gnome for making it more comfortable, you could use any modification of goneme project (for example a nautilus with tabs...). Maybe it serve to you for 1) having ideas for what modifications you will make and 2) use some of goneme modifications of official gnome.
