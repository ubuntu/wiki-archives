== Summary ==

The <nowiki>[[UbuntuCommercialSupport]]</nowiki> aims to provide
an interface for getting commercial support from Canonical Ltd, right into "System > Help > Commercial Support"

== Rationale ==

Companies and businesses can't rely on getting support from random individuals. What they need is a dedicated 24/7 technical support from a company that offers that kind of services, and knows exactly what they need. The fate of their solutions and operations depends on good support.

Non-technical users are likely to have a problem of knowing exactly what they need. Alot of users don't know anything about technical details, and sometimes they are having a hard time putting up the right questions together. Technical people in chat rooms are most likely to be impatient about non-technical users who asks unappropriate questions. A non-technical user may be terrified of getting answers from chat rooms because of the fear of unappropriate technical questions. What they need is a 24/7 dedicated service support where they can be confident to ask questions.

A concrete support for a specific company that uses complex solutions, requires full technical details, and absolute answer. Random individuals from chat rooms are unlikely to be inexperience about a certain question for a complex systems. What they need is a 24/7 dedicated support service that knows exactly the answers from what they are asking for.

== Comments ==

<nowiki>[[JoeyStanford|Joey Stanford]]</nowiki> - I like the basic idea of this spec. Sending credit card information via plain text however is very bad as it opens up a great possibility of <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_fraud|internet fraud]]</nowiki>. Visa and Mastercard have begun to <nowiki>[[http://www.4w.com/creditcardsecurity.shtml|probit sending or storing]]</nowiki> plain text credit card information. 

<nowiki>[[StevenHarms|Steven Harms]]</nowiki> - I would recommend a web based payment approach where you can provide a more professional, and more importantly, secure channel for communication.  An advantage to this would be the numerous web-based toolchains already in place so you can elminate redunancy of work and save time on unit tests etc.  If I was purchasing an item for my company and they requested my information plaintext email the first thing that comes to mind is scam.
