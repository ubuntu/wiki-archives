__TOC__

== PHASE ==

The project is currently stable. This is in production at <nowiki>[[http://sd.ubuntu-us.org/planet]]</nowiki>.

== Purpose ==

The purpose of the Ubuntu Drupal Planet module is to mimic the way Planet``Planet works. A sample of Planet``Planet can be seen on <nowiki>[[http://planet.ubuntu.net/]]</nowiki>.

== Design ==

A focus will be held on end user functionality as well as the overall "eye appeal" which includes graphics. A style.css and a style-rtl.css will be built to handle multiple languages.
