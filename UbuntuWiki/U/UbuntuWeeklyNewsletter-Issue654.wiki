==== Corrections to point release publications of current LTSes ====

Steve Langasek reminds us of the dropping of MD5 & SHA1 checksums for Ubuntu and flavor ISOs, in favor of sha256sums only. In the clean up, the md5sum and sha1sum files have now been removed for all currently-published releases. Among the clean up items all stale point release images have been taken down.

https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-release/2020-October/005113.html

==== Ubuntu Glibc News ====

Balint Reczey writes about glibc 2.32 as found in Ubuntu 20.10 that includes many new features, plus some deprecations, which have mitigations. In respect to these, because a number of the mitigations will be dropped in due course, a warning is given. If your current application/package builds using one of these mitigations you need to update your programs before the mitigations are dropped. Updates to glibc used in Ubuntu 20.04 LTS are also noted, likewise with Ubuntu 18.04 LTS; which will soon receive it's update of glibc 2.27. A note is given on how to file merge proposals for Ubuntu specific patches.

==== Ubuntu clouds on the Raspberry Pi ====

Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols mentions the Ubuntu 20.10 release, noting especially that it provides "optimized Raspberry Pi images for the desktop, server and the cloud". Steven lists some of the features found in Ubuntu 20.10, before quoting Mark Shuttleworth's statement on the Raspberry Pi Foundation's commitment to open computing. The reasons why Ubuntu 20.10 is worth using on the Raspberry Pi 4 (esp. with 8GB RAM) are given, along with numerous links.
