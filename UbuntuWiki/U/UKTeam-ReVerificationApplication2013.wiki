=== Roadmap ===

* ''Continue maintaining good discussions on IRC and mailing lists'' - 
* ''14.04 launch party'' - it would be great to have party with more put into it than just going to a pub.
* ''Raspberry Pi build cluster'' - Several people are contributing towards a build cluster intended to compile Ubuntu for the ARMV6 architecture for the Raspberry Pi.
* ''14.04 distribution'' - it is possible that there will be a DVD distribution to Locos of 14.04 DVDs which we would be happy to participate in.

=== Experience ===

There have been a number of events held since the last approval, we ran a series of "Happy Hour" meetups around the country which was good fun, however we struggled to sustain the activity longer term. This is something we could consider starting up again.

There have been several successful events on the Watercress Line Real Ale train and regular release parties held in London.

Most events are documented on the LoCo Portal

Overall, community activity has slowed down, the mailing list conversations continue as does the IRC channel activity. We continue to have events but they are not growing in size. There are a number of contributory factors to this, and it could change in the future.
