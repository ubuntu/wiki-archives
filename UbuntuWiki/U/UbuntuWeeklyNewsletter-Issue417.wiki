==== Why Can't Ubuntu Play Well With Others? ====

Bruce Byfield of Datamation reminds us that over the past 10 years of Ubuntu Mark Shuttleworth has made calls for cooperation, including at the recent Ubuntu Online Summit. But with each call the community questions his motives. Bruce says that most of his calls created distrust within the community,and he now seems to just focus on getting his visions finished or in most cases “started” and done with his leadership.
