==== Call for contributors: Flutter Ubuntu settings app ====

Frederik Feichtmeier tells us a small team of developers have created a small flutter project for Ubuntu Desktop.  The purpose of the app is to "explore the power of flutter whilst enjoying the ease of coding". This is a call for more contributors: for any ideas, bug reports, or coding.

https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/call-for-contributors-flutter-ubuntu-settings-app/24188

==== Canonical & Ubuntu at ARM Dev Summit 2021 ====

Darkolarczyk conveys the October 19-21 virtual Arm Dev``Summit conference wherein the topic is Canonical’s Anbox Cloud on Ampere® Altra® platforms. Featured speakers discuss the roles of micro clouds and edge clouds in edge clusters. The workshop is suitable for both the beginners and experts; aimed also towards engineers, developers, and tech enthusiasts.

==== Feature Freeze Exception: Seeding the official Firefox snap in Ubuntu Desktop ====

Ken Van``Dine reports that the Ubuntu Desktop Team have "opened a Feature Freeze exception to replace the firefox seed in ubuntu-desktop from a deb package to a Mozilla-official Firefox snap". We are told the snap is a collaboration between the Ubuntu Desktop Team and Mozilla developers that "is the first step towards a deb-to-snap transition taking place during the 22.04 development cycle". Details of this change, what is impacted and what is not are discussed; if you've got questions this post is the place for them.

==== Ubuntu Touch OTA-19 Is Slated for Release on September 17th, Now Ready for Testing ====

Marius Nestor reports that the UBports Foundation has announced that Ubuntu Touch OTA-19 software update is available for public testing. We are told it's still based on Ubuntu 16.04, with various improvements and bug fixes, and added features for some devices. We are reminded the amount of updates is less for current OTAs as effort is being spent on the migration to Ubuntu 20.04. This is a beta release and is "slated for" final release on 17 September.

==== Bored of Flat UIs? Check Out Skeuos GTK Theme ====

Joey Sneddon asks us if we have ever wished GTK themes had "more depth", well this might be your answer. He tells us about the Skeuos GTK theme, along with screenshots, that there are light or dark variants, with variations available for GNOME 3.36, GNOME 40, Cinnamon, XFWM4, and more. If you can't find your perfect configuration though; a script is available to generate your own version using colors you prefer. Links are provided.

==== Looks Like Ubuntu 21.10 (Impish Indri) Will Be Powered by Linux Kernel 5.13 ====

Marius Nestor writes that Ubuntu 21.10 is currently "powered" by the Linux 5.13 kernel series, and gives an opinion that it's likely to remain on that kernel. Reminding us of the kernel freeze dates, we are told of some of the new features that came with the Linux 5.13 kernel.

==== Ubuntu 21.10 Default Wallpaper Revealed ====

Joey Sneddon tells us the Ubuntu 21.10 default wallpaper has been revealed, and provides us with a look at it. Reminding us of the "origami-inspired", "geometric motif", and "intersecting concentric rings" themes found in recent releases, Joey sees this wallpaper as a more "simplistic rendition"; which perhaps makes it "stronger".

==== The Increasing Importance Of ACPI Platform Profiles With Today's Throttle-Happy Hardware ====

Michael Larabel renders some background on ACPI Platform Profile implementations on the latest laptops in efforts to control power/cooling/performance preferences. Michael notes that balancing these "has rather complicated the Linux support". Michael relates Jens Axboe's advice to work around the throttling issue on his Lenovo laptop as a working alternative.
