==== KDE Frameworks 5.93 Brings Multi-Cursor Support for Text Editor Apps, over 280 Changes ====

Marius Nestor writes that the KDE Project has released KDE Frameworks 5.93, reminding us what this is, and why it's useful for those using KDE apps. We are told of many of the improvements, some of which will be seen in non-KDE apps. We are told KDE Frameworks 5.93 will soon make its way into stable software repositories so we can enjoy the "improvements and bug fixes".

==== Intel Alder Lake Users On Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Will Want To Switch To A Newer Kernel ====

Michael Larabel reminds us that Ubuntu 22.04 LTS will be using the Linux 5.15 LTS kernel, but notes that whilst it has many backported hardware improvements from later 5.16 & 5.17 kernels, there are still many more not included. Michael highlights what he calls a "pain point" for "Alder Lake" processors having slower execution times than a system with a newer kernel. We are told it was Intel providing the patches rather late which led to its inclusion in 5.16. Michael provides his benchmarks - which include Ubuntu 21.10, Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, with its 5.15 kernel, tested against the 5.16 & 5.17 kernels for comparison; which highlight the greater performance in the later kernels.

==== Mesa 22.1-rc1 Brings Radeon Vulkan Enhancements, Imagination Driver & Microsoft Dozen ====

Michael Larabel highlights many of the improvements, enhancements, merges, and changes in the soon to be released Mesa 22.1. Of special note are improvements for old NVIDIA graphics on open-source, enhancements for the Radeon "RADV" Vulkan driver, works on Intel, and much more.
