==== New Local communities health check process ====

Bhavani Shankar writes on the Lo``Co Council blog about some changes around how team approvals are handled. “Every team shall be known as a Lo``Co team, teams that were previously known as an “Approved Lo``Co team” shall be known as a “Verified Lo``Co team”. New teams shall be a Lo``Co team, teams do not have to be verified.  The term ''Verified'' means that a Launchpad team has been created, the team name conforms to the correct naming standard, and the team contact has signed the Code of Conduct.”

Jorge links to video of a charm school tutorial on how to use the local provider.
