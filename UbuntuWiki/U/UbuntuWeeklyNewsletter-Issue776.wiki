==== Ubuntu Pro - FAQ ====

Lech has posted a Ubuntu Pro FAQ that was written in "collaboration with Ubuntu community leads". This document has an Executive summary section, asks if Ubuntu is still free, addresses differences between Main and Universe repositories, and more. It contains useful links & some examples, as well as some links for more details if required in this comprehensive doc. We are told this document will be altered as is required.

https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/ubuntu-pro-faq/34042

==== Ubuntu Flavor Packaging Defaults ====

Philip Kewisch writes about Ubuntu flavors, and that Ubuntu is a community of communities, before moving to packaging. We are told Ubuntu and flavors "consider debs and snaps the default", but with users able to use their "freedom of choice" and thus use other alternatives like Flatpak. We are told flatpak will just be an install away, but will no longer be a default for any Ubuntu flavor from 23.04 forward. A list of FAQ (updated as required) is also provided.

https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/ubuntu-flavor-packaging-defaults/34061

==== Enable Flatpak in Xubuntu ====

Sean Davis writes that Debian, Snap, and Appimage packages are dealt with 'out of the box' in Xubuntu. He then reminds us what Flatpaks are, including an embedded video too, and gives a reason/examples why Xubuntu users may want to use them. What follows is thus the commands needed to enable Flatpak support in Xubuntu, which includes GNOME Software app support. Screenshots are included.

https://blog.bluesabre.org/2023/02/22/enable-flatpak-in-xubuntu/

=== Other Community News ===

==== Using Flatpaks on Lubuntu ====

Aaron Rainbolt (Array``Bolt3) advises, though Flatpak is not enabled by default, the packaging is available in the software repository. It only takes the two provided commands to install Flatpak, and enable the Flathub repository. Aaron, additionally, gives a short primer on the usage of the app store to facilitate finding desired Flatpak apps.
