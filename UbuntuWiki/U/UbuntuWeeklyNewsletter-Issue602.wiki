==== Boosting the Real Time Performance of Gnome Shell 3.34 in Ubuntu 19.10 ====

Daniel van Vugt's detailed blog tells us what Gnome Shell really is, and of the other parts that make Gnome shell work, including mutter. Daniel gives some background of cold spots, hot spots and real time, and stuttering issues; before moving to real time bugs found and fixed in Gnome 3.34. Next Daniel covers bugs found but not yet fixed (some should be fixed by 3.36 for Ubuntu 20.04). He notes mistakes made that ideally won't be repeated, why Gnome is faster on newer hardware, making it faster for older machines, and a rough timetable for when Ubuntu users should see these results.
