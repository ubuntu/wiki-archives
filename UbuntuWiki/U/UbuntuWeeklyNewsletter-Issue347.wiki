==== Ubuntu Touch OS wins its first smartphone partner ====

Stephen Shankland of CNET informs us that Mark Shuttleworth has confirmed that Ubuntu Touch has its first official smartphone partner, though the partner remains unnamed. Four other brands are also in line to become partners in the near future. With carrier support from nearly all the big names, Ubuntu Touch is positioned to make a big splash when the first phones begin shipping next year.

He also reaffirms that this is a community project and that it will not succeed without your help.

=== In The Blogosphere ===

==== Confirmed: Canonical Is Forking GNOME Control Center And GNOME Settings Daemon For Ubuntu 14.04 ====

Andrew of Web``Upd8 informs us that Robert Ancell has confirmed Canonical will be forking GNOME Control Center (commonly known as System Settings) and GNOME Settings Daemon for the upcoming 14.04 release of Ubuntu. Recently Ubuntu GNOME has been blocked from shipping the latest releases due to the need to have them heavily patched for Ubuntu, as a result from now on Ubuntu GNOME will be able to do so without conflicts.

http://www.webupd8.org/2013/12/confirmed-canonical-is-forking-gnome.html

OMG! Ubuntu also covers this news in the next article.

==== Ubuntu Confirm GNOME Control Centre Fork for 14.04 ====

Joey-Elijah Sneddon of OMG! Ubuntu! writes that Ubuntu has confirmed they will be forking the GNOME Control Center for the upcoming 14.04 release. Through the 13.10 release, they’ve been shipping a heavily patched version and have opted to simply fork it rather than continuing to apply updates and patches. He notes that on the plus side, it will no longer conflict with the vanilla version being shipped with Ubuntu GNOME.
