__TOC__

This should probably be a number of shorter (3 sessions of 15 minutes in each 45min block?) BOFs taking only a smaller number of people away.

== People ==

* ScottJamesRemnant
* '''everyone in the distro team'''

== Goals ==

Formally introduce the distro team to HCT, work one-on-one with each member to get their desired packages into dogfood, and demonstrate how to manage that package using the hct.
