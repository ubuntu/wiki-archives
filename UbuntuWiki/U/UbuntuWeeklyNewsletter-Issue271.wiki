=== In The Press ===

==== Shuttleworth on Ubuntu Linux, Fedora, and the UEFI problem ====

Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols, ZDNet, explores the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) replacement for BIOS issue with regard to Linux support by reviewing Red Hat’s solution and then sharing comments from Mark Shuttleworth about the approach for Ubuntu. He notes that Shuttleworth is not happy with the current approaches and is quoted as saying “Secure Boot retains flaws in its design that will ultimately mandate that Microsoft’s key is on every PC (because of core UEFI driver signing). That, and the inability of Secure Boot to support multiple signatures on critical elements means that options are limited but we continue to seek a better result.”
