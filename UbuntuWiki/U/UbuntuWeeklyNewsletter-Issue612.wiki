==== Catfish 1.4.12 Released ====

Sean Davis reports the release of Catfish 1.4.12 which now supports Wayland. This release of Catfish also utilizes client-side decorations that are modal, has improved Preferences and Search index dialogs, and other fixes that will aid packaging for distributions. A list of 17 translation updates is provided, a link to the source tarball, plus we're told it'll be in Xubuntu 20.04.

==== Ubuntu Studio 20.04 LTS Status ====

The Ubuntu Studio team have posted to calm some fears that Ubuntu Studio 20.04 LTS won't be a long-term-support release; we are told it will be. We are updated on the strength of the Ubuntu Studio team, the upload privileges of core members, ie. Erick Eickmeyer, Ross Gammon and Thomas Ward. We are given the impression of strength in the Ubuntu Studio team & of their development. A new web site is coming for Ubuntu Studio, along with improvements to the Ubuntu Studio Controls for 20.04 LTS, additional audio/instrument plugins, and more polish compared to 19.10. If we'd like to help the team, supporting other users via Ask Ubuntu, or IRC is needed.
