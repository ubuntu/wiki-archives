==== Zenbleed vulnerability fix for Ubuntu ====

Lech Sandecki reminds us of the discovery by Google's Information Security Engineering team on 24 July 2023 of the AMD Zen 2 family of microprocessors "Zenbleed" vulnerability (CVE-2023-20593). This led to AMDs microcode updates being released to supported Ubuntu releases within 24 hours of the original announcement. This post alerts us to the details of this vulnerability, what machines are impacted, some links to the relevant Ubuntu Security Notices (back on 25 July 2023) plus subsequent notices/fixes. Further, we are given commands that allow us to check our systems to see if we're still vulnerable.

==== Ubuntu 23.10 seems like the usual boring update - until you dig into it ====

Jack Wallen tells us that whilst Ubuntu Desktop isn't his favorite; he has always found it stable & solid. In a test of Ubuntu 23.10 daily he expected a "boring" upgrade, which "on the surface" is what Jack found. We're then walked through many parts that Jack found remarkable. We're given some screenshots, and links for more details to some of these changes, before being reminded the release is scheduled for 12 October 2023.

==== Ubuntu Portugal Podcast: Episode 267 - Drogas, Pai Cinco e Gatinhos ====

"Depois de uma semana atribulada que envolveu queixinhas à CNPD (outra vez?!), resmunguices sobre atentados à privacidade (outra vez?!) e ataques misteriosos na Internet, recebemos a visita do Senhor Carrancudo com um convidado muito especial, que só trabalha para os sugar dadd…digo, patronos e potenciais patrocinadores. O Diogo trouxe más notícias sobre snaps, boas notícias sobre Kernels, mais más notícias sobre extensões e notícias assim-assim sobre encontrões com um Minotauro, agenda do Centro Linux, festas de lançamento, ajuntamentos no outro extremo do planeta e reuniões aqui bem perto. Para o fim ficou a notícia bombástica, com os detalhes que estão a deixar toda a gente louca para ir às compras…e mais não dizemos. É lidar."
