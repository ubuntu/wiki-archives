==== Ubuntu keeping up with GNOME stable updates ====

Sebastien Bacher writes in response to a recent blog about Epiphany and acknowledges that while the Ubuntu package was outdated, it is now resolved. Sebastien critiques Michael's [Catanzaro] blog over a few points, providing links to the argument.

We are advised if anyone has an issue with a component the team will do their best "to fix the situation".

==== Firefox starts blocking third-party cookies by default ====

Emil Protalinski writes about Mozilla Firefox's Enhanced Tracking Protection which blocks cookies from third-party trackers. Additionally, advisements are made of improvements to Mozilla's Facebook Container extension, a rebranded Lockwise password keeper desktop extension, and an updated Firefox Monitor for storing email addresses. Providing a brief history of Firefox's tracking protection, we are told Enhanced Tracking Protection will be on by default for new installs, its blocking based on Disconnect's tracking rules. It will be rolled out for existing Firefox users over the coming months. Details of the extension upgrades are also provided, along with screenshots and embedded video.
