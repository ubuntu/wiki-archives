=== In Other News ===

==== Ubuntu Looks To Improve Its Windows Installer ====

Michael Larabel of Phoronix writes about discussions during the Ubuntu Developer Summit regarding Wubi, the technology used to install Ubuntu as a partition within an existing Windows installation. Larabel writes that plans include "support for burning to a USB stick, integrated CD burning of Ubuntu, a visual refresh to the user-interface, and better uninstall support" and goes on to highlight a wish list item of "having Wubi be able to handle a full-disk encrypted Windows installation."

http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTIxODA

==== Hybrid Graphics In Ubuntu Are Still Lackluster ====

Michael Larabel of Phoronix discusses the current dismal support for hybrid graphics in Linux. One of the most interesting points raised is that kernel developers are blocking proprietary drivers from using DMA-BUF which effectively locks out proprietary drivers from being supported with hybrid graphics.

http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTIxOTM

==== Canonical Is in a Partnership with Valve and Unity Technologies ====

Jason Warner gives a UDS-R interview about one of the most important Linux collaborations. He outlines how the Valve, Unity Technologies, and Canonical are working on a daily basis to bring big games to Linux. Even if you're not a gamer, it is clear that this is a 'big deal' for Ubuntu and is one more step to crossing the chasm.
