=== Testimonials ===

==== Ubuntu Membership ====

UndiFineD showed up unexpectedly during the Dutch Translation sprint for Maverick where he translated both Orca and the complex financial part of gcalctool in just two days. It was a welcome surprise that he was there to help, certainly gcalctool would not have been translated without him. He continues to be active for the Dutch Translation Team, attending meetings and submitting suggestions for many packages. <<BR>> -- (last edited 2010-11-02 20:06:21 by <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~redmar|Redmar, Ubuntu Dutch Translators (trijntje on IRC)]]</nowiki>)

UndiFineD has shown a tremendous amount of energy in helping to guide prospective members to the Ubuntu Beginners team. UndiFineD also has an energy and passion that is directed at issues concerning accessibility in FOSS and Ubuntu. His work on the Dutch team and with translations is outstanding as well. I believe that Keimpe will be an excellent representative of the Ubuntu community for years to come and strongly support his bid for Ubuntu Membership. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:cprofitt]]</nowiki> 
Keimpe has been a positive force in all the projects I have seen him in, he has been helping on a number of Accessibility projects and his work with new users to Ubuntu is great. I think he should be a Member. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:alanbell]]</nowiki> 
I have had the pleasure of working with UndiFineD in both <nowiki>[[Lubuntu]]</nowiki> and the <nowiki>[[BeginnersTeam]]</nowiki>. His efforts in both have been great, always around on IRC to help and always willing to pitch in with documentation. Keimpe is always warm and kind to new members and is an asset to any team he chooses to participate in (I hear his work in the Dutch LoCo is outstanding as well). I wholeheartedly support his application to be a Ubuntu Member. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:jarednorris]]</nowiki> <<DateTime>>

Keimpe has shown a tremendous desire and ability to help with Ubuntu. His dedication to the Beginners Team is noteworthy. A powerful desire to insure that all individuals regardless of disability has driven him to help with Accessibility as much as possible. His answers on IRC are always courteous and to the point. He takes time to explain as much as needed when necessary to the newcomer. His application for Ubuntu Membership should be approved as soon as possible. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:charlie-tca]]</nowiki> 
I have mostly worked with Keimpe on the Accessibility Team where he has shown his worth this cycle. He is committed to Ubuntu and open source for all people. He is always willing to jump in to help others and is courteous in how he does so. I'm quite please he's applying for membership and support his application. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:pendulum]]</nowiki> 
Keimpe is really doing a great work for the community in Ubuntu Beginners Team as well as Lubuntu project. His contributions are countless and the knowledge he has is highly remarkable. I fully support his application for Ubuntu Membership. --<nowiki>[[Mohan_chml|Mohi]]</nowiki> 2011-04-05

UndiFineD has been great to work with. He has been very helpful to keep our meetings going and staying organized in our efforts on the Ubuntu-Adverts project. We've been slowly progressing with this new team and Undi has been a key part of our efforts so far. Thanks UndiFineD! -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:mattgriffin]]</nowiki> 2011-04-05
