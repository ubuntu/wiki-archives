We made this a short term in order to let others have the possibility of being part of the council. 

=== Roadmap ===

Our roadmap is a plan with a wide range of options. The options are presented by members of our LoCo on the web, IRC or Forum. In the weekly meeting we discuss them and set our goals. This is a summary of the projects we are working on for future plans.

Projects:

* <nowiki>[[UruguayTeam-Proyectos-EstadoLibre|Estado Libre]]</nowiki>: This translates as free state, this project aims to give info to the government about FLOSS and Ubuntu, we talk to every political party with parliamentary representation and to the President. We already send all the letters. The work of this project will also be to promote FLOSS and Ubuntu in other areas as Public and Private Education institutions, and Home or Business scenarios.  
 
* <nowiki>[[UruguayTeam-Proyectos-3G|3G]]</nowiki>: This a documentation project. We explain how to set up 3G wireless modems on Ubuntu with any of the Internet providers in Uruguay. In addition to this, we have a parallel project to teach how to configure ADSL. <nowiki>[[UruguayTeam-Proyectos-ADSL|ADSL Project]]</nowiki>
 
* <nowiki>[[UruguayTeam-ConferenciasUruguay|Conference At Uruguay]]</nowiki> This is a way to have a team of people who are ready to give talks when we have an opportunity, this means talks to the public, local groups, Teachers, Parents at schools or any other place. This Project will be the new and greater form of <nowiki>[[UruguayTeam-EducandoEducadores|Educando Educadores]]</nowiki> Project, a project which aims to give talks to Teachers from schools and high Schools about Ubuntu and FLOSS.
 
* <nowiki>[[UruguayTeam-RevistaUbuntu|Uruguay LoCo Magazine]]</nowiki> We are going to publish a magazine on PDF to start, with high hopes to have a paper version in the future. Everyone is welcome to contribute, as in our community everyone is welcome. We are going to focus on Ubuntu but other FLOSS project will be in the magazine too. 
 
* We give support to users at our website and IRC channel.
 
* We plan to give Ubuntu Basic courses on our Website using Moodle.
 
* Advocacy, this will be to improve our CD distribution. People in different cities of Uruguay give out Ubuntu cds. In order to promote cds, we only ask for a blank cd in exchange in order to do more copies.
 
* Collect hardware in order to gift Institutions who work with kids. After we fix the hardware we Install Edubuntu and we vote which Institution we give them.
