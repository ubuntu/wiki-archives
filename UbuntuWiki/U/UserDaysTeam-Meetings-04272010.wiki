=== Agenda ===

* Review Feedback from previous User Day -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:chrisjohnston]]</nowiki>  * Determine what classes were good, what classes weren't as good, and how we can improve them -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:chrisjohnston]]</nowiki>  
* Determine if some classes need to be split up to allow for more time (i.e. 2 sessions) -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:chrisjohnston]]</nowiki>  * Do we want to have all classes be 55 minutes and add a built in 5 minute break between sessions (to fix a complaint from last time) -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:chrisjohnston]]</nowiki>
