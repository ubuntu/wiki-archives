==== Interview with YokoZar of the Ubuntu Community Council ====

In the seventh and final interview of the series, Scott Ritchie (Yoko``Zar) talks about what he does for a career, his first computing experience, and some of the Ubuntu projects he's worked on over the years. He says that his focus on Ubuntu today is keeping the Wine packages "healthy and reasonable." In his final comments, Scott says: "What we do matters. If you can make Ubuntu just a tiny bit better, that benefit is multiplied across millions of people. There are few opportunities in life where you can have that big of a positive impact on other human beings."
