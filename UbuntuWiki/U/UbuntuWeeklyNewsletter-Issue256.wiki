==== Ubuntu Linux 12.04 One-Ups Windows and Mac, Shuttleworth Says ====

Katherine Noyes of PCWorld wrote about Mark Shuttleworth's blog post where he asserted that Ubuntu 12.04 LTS represents the first time “real desktop user experience innovation is available on a full production-ready enterprise-certified free software platform, free of charge, well before it shows up in Windows or MacOS."

"Still, I think it's interesting to hear the magnitude of Shuttleworth's assertions this time around. Ubuntu 12.04, apparently, isn't just another release, in Canonical's view--it's the first solid look at what Canonical wants its distro to be in the coming years, and how it plans to advance in a desktop market still dominated by Windows and Macs," Noyes noted.

==== How Linux is changing lives in Zambia ====

Adam Oxford of Tech Radar does an in-depth report of work being done by several organizations in Zambia using open source software to increase communication within developing communities. The goal is to achieve this through broader availability of Internet access and computer labs, computer training, and other services. They have an “Ubuntu Campus” for their small technology training college “named in honour of a certain popular distribution and the ideal behind the name.” The article reports that they “also install open source alternatives such as Firefox, Google Chrome, Libre Office, Gimp, Audacity etc. We utilise Ubuntu as our primary distro, though we do keep tabs on other distros.”

=== In The Blogosphere ===

==== Is Ubuntu 12.04 a Linux Game Changer? ====

Matt Hartley of Datamation writes about how, despite being critical of Unity, that Unity offers a stable configurable desktop experience. Hartley says, "Thanks to the HUD (heads up display), more Unity-based configuration options, support for Sandy Bridge, and improved power consumption, Ubuntu 12.04 is shaping up to be a really solid release."
