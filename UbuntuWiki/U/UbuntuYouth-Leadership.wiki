== UY Council - Introduction ==
Hi and welcome to the Ubuntu Youth Council Page. Here you'll find all the info related to the Ubuntu Youth Council, who they are, what they do, and what you can expect from them.

=== About Us ===
The Ubuntu Youth Council Aims to:

* Provide a good IRC experience for younger users.
* Provide a dedicated channel for youth to hang out in, while having fun.

=== What does the Ubuntu Youth Council do? ===
The Ubuntu Youth Council was put in place as a group of people who are there to vote on important decisions regarding the Youth Team. They are also able to sort out problems and disputes within the Ubuntu youth community, although, like the rest of us they are volunteering their own time to be available on the Council.
