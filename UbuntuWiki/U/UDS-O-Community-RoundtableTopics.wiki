== Roundtable Topics for the Community Track ==

This page is for subjects/things you'd like to bring up at UDS. If a subject takes more than ~15 minutes to discuss, then you should probably <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2011-March/032813.html|submit a proposal blueprint]]</nowiki> and name it community-o-$youridea. The roundtable sessions cover other things.
