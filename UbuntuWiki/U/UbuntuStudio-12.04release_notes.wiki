== New Features in Ubuntu Studio 12.04 LTS ==
Ubuntu Studio is the Ubuntu flavour designed for content creation.

It's produced as a DVD image that can also be converted to an USB stick and includes support for most languages by default.

Ubuntu Studio 12.04 LTS is a 3 year Long Term Support release and will be supported until April 2015.

Due to overwhelming improvements during this development cycle, the The Ubuntu Studio Team is very proud and excited to have users experience Ubuntu Studio 12.04 LTS and provide feedback.  We look forward to hearing from you.

* Long Term Support release (3 years)

Lastly, the Ubuntu Studio website is currently under complete development and is expected to be release within weeks.  Please bear with our current website until then.

=== Ubuntu Studio Applications ===
This cycle we focused on developing <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuStudio/Workflows|work flows]]</nowiki> based on user tasks.  This should give a more complete, functional, and robust application tool chain for users to create content.  ''Please note that not all work flows listed in the wiki are directly supported in a default installation.''

Notable applications for audio/video/graphic/photography work flows include:
* JACK - lowlatency and flexible routing sound server
* Ardour - multitrack digital audio workstation
* qtractor - multitrack audio recorder and sequencer
* LADSPA/LV2 - audio plugins
* OpenShot - easy to use video editor
* Blender - 3D modeler and incredible video editor/compositor
* GIMP - powerful pixel-based image editor
* Inkscape - scalable vector graphics editor/creator
* Darktable - RAW digital photograph editor

Common desktop applications saw changes as well:
* gedit - text editor
* Ristretto - image viewer
* Firefox - internet browser
* Transmission - bittorrent client
* XChat - IRC client
* Audacious - audio player
* Totem - movie player
* Brasero - disc burner

== Installation ==

=== Overview ===

Preparing your computer for Ubuntu Studio is now much simpler, with a wider range of disk setup options. Each of these are detailed at length to provide you with a clear understanding of the actions that will take place with your selection.

You can now reinstall or upgrade an existing copy of Ubuntu Studio with the Ubuntu Studio DVD installer, provided that your computer is connected to the Internet. 

=== Download ===

** http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntustudio/releases/precise/ (UbuntuStudio) 

=== System Requirements ===

The minimum memory requirement for Ubuntu Studio 12.04 is 512 MB of memory.  It is highly recommended that you have 2GB or more memory though so that the system will perform much better.  More information about other recommended hardware on the new Ubuntu Studio website when it is released.

== Upgrading ==

=== Upgrading from Ubuntu Studio 11.10 ===

To upgrade from Ubuntu Studio 11.10, press Alt+F2 and type in "update-manager" (without the quotes) into the command box. Update Manager should open up and display following message: "New distribution release '12.04' is available. Click Upgrade and follow the on-screen instructions". 

=== Upgrading from Ubuntu Studio 10.04 LTS to Ubuntu Studio 12.04 LTS ===

It is recommended that users perform a complete instal rather than upgrade from Ubuntu Studio 10.04 LTS due to extent of the changes, including desktop environments.

=== Upgrading from Other Releases ===

Users of other Ubuntu Studio releases need to upgrade first to 11.10, and then to 12.04.

For further information on upgrading to 11.10, please see the <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OneiricUpgrades| Ubuntu Oneiric upgrade instructions ]]</nowiki>.
