==== Canonical Delves Deeper into the Cloud – Launches Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud Services ====

London: July 1, 2009-- Canonical, the founder of the Ubuntu project, today launched new professional services to help and support users building 'private clouds', cloud infrastructures behind a corporate firewall.

The move follows the technical preview in April of Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud (UEC), an open-source system that enables organizations to build their own clouds that match the interface of Amazon EC2. UEC is now available as part of the Ubuntu Server Edition technology stack.

By creating private clouds with UEC, organizations can optimize server use and increase data-centre efficiencies, while lowering costs and providing end users with self-service IT. Ubuntu is the first Linux distribution to provide such a system and now Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud Services from Canonical help businesses build these environments with optimal efficiency.

“Enterprises are realizing that building 'private clouds' enables them to better manage variable workloads, while reducing the waste of idle servers. Building on open-source technology also avoids the issue of vendor lock-in,” said Mark Shuttleworth, CEO of Canonical. “Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud enables businesses to do this  - and the addition of these services helps them to do it with confidence.”

Canonical has partnered with Eucalyptus, whose eponymous product forms the base of UEC, to jointly provide the service but with a single interface for the customer through the Canonical support team.

“While the IT industry talks of future strategies and releases vapour ware, UEC today allows businesses to deploy and now support a 'private cloud' on open source technologies from a renowned Linux provider,” said Woody Rollins, CEO of Eucalyptus. “We are very excited to lend our expertise to building the type of professional services that will help more businesses discover the benefits of private clouds built on open technologies.”
Pricing and Availability

Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud Services enable users to scale up from a five-machine environment all the way to a site license covering all machines, physical and virtual, in a single location.

Yearly pricing for entry-level support for five physical servers and up to 25 virtual Ubuntu servers is $4,750 for 9x5 standard support and $17,500 for 24x7 advanced support. Additional support packs are available per physical server and per ten virtual servers for $1,250 p.a. for standard support and $3,000 p.a. for advanced.

Site support is also available which covers one geographical location. It includes an unlimited number of physical and virtual servers for $90,000 p.a. for standard support and $150,000 p.a. for advanced.

To use Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud, users must first install Ubuntu 9.04 Server Edition available at no charge from http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download-server

==== Tutorial of the Week ====

June 6, 2009.

This week we would like to highlight Fake``Outdoorsman's (http://ubuntuforums.org/member.php?u=162846) well written and nicely presented "HOWTO: Easily enable MP3, MPEG4, AAC, and other restricted encoding in FFmpeg". As pointed out in the thread, this tutorial clears up some confusion linked to legal reasons restricting the abilities of the ubuntu provided FFmpeg package. Several options are provided, along with the steps to follow to revert changes and remove the restricted packages. Well done!

==== Ubuntu Forums working on Login with Open ID ====

Canonical has been working with ubuntu-geek to implement openID authentication on the forums. Work is still in development as some features need to be adjusted (adding friends for example). This is part of the process leading to a greater integration between forums accounts and Launchpad accounts. Stay tuned!

==== Jonathan Riddell: Canonical Party Welcomes Gran Canaria Desktop Summit ====

The Gran Canaria Desktop Summit was opened with a party sponsored by Canonical. Stickers, t-shirts and beer were all given out to contributors and users of KDE, Gnome and any other free software environment. Some converts were made from the local Canary island population who were enthused by the spirit of freedom. Conversation ranged from the essential cross desktop collaboration issues to the question of whether it ever rains in Las Palmas. Pictures of the party can be found at the link.

==== Mackenzie Morgan: Ohio Linuxfest Call for Presentations ====

Ohio Linuxfest is now in its 7th year, and the theme for this years event is the Past, Present, and Future of UNIX & Linux. Doug Mc``Ilroy will be keynoting.  If you haven't heard of him yet, he was Kernighan, Thomson, & Richie's boss back at AT&T Bell Labs when they were creating UNIX and C. He's credited with creating the UNIX pipe ("|") as well. Peter Salus, known for his books "A Quarter Century of UNIX" and "The Daemon, the Gnu and the Penguin" will be keynoting as well.  And finally, Shawn Powers of Linux Journal fame will be giving a keynote on "Fixing the Economy with Linux." Bdale and his daughter Elizabeth Garbee are expected to speak. Jono has also agreed to speak. But these six people can't be it.  If you've got something to say, why not submit a proposal? The call for presentations is only open a few more days—it closes on the 8th. Get your proposal in! You can find out more about this event at the link.

==== Ubuntu’s Papercuts: Usability in Little Things ====

Linux Loop notes that the first ten of the One Hundred Papercuts have been finished.  These are little things, like changing a word from one that geeks would understand to one that most normal people would understand.  The author believes that this might be the first time that real attention has been made to tiny details.

==== As It Stands, Ubuntu Has No Issues With Mono ====

Michael Larabel of Phoronix reports on the position paper concerning Mono that was issued by Scott James Remnant on behalf of Canonical and the Ubuntu Technical Board.  This paper was released in response to the concerns of free software advocates, including Richard Stallman, who question the legal aspects of using Mono.  However, Ubuntu continues to include it and packages built on it, like F-Spot and Tomboy, in the distribution since there have not been any legal notices of infringement from Microsoft or other IP stakeholders.  Scott's position statement on Mono in Ubuntu can be found on Ubuntu's mailing list: https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel-announce/2009-June/000584.html

==== Ubuntu: Still Popular? ====

The author of Starry Hope looks at some statistics concerning Ubuntu popularity, with the understanding that they really can't project the actual numbers of users.  However, in that light, he presents the information from Distro``Watch, Netcraft and Alexa along with blogging trends, Google trends in searching, and Twitter.  His conclusion is that Ubuntu is still the most popular Linux distribution.  Those interested in the statistics may find his numbers, charts, and conclusions at the link.

==== Desktop Linux Reviews: Kubuntu 9.04 ====

Jim Lynch wasn't particularly impressed with Kubuntu 9.04, and felt that it best served experienced Linux users that enjoy KDE and prefer it to Gnome.  He did not recommend that new Linux users try it.  Some of his objections had to do with the look-and-feel of KDE, and he acknowledges that he is primarily a GNOME user.  The quality of the add/remove software and the sliding menus were two of his objections.  Read the whole article at:  http://desktoplinuxreviews.com/2009/06/25/kubuntu-9-04/

==== Linux Vendors Head to the Cloud in Search of Cash ====

Sean Michael Kerner of Internet``News.com examines the difference between the Red Hat certification program for Cloud Computing and Ubuntu's paid support services.  The main difference appears to be that Ubuntu does not see Certification as being valuable.  Simon Wardley, head of Canonical's cloud strategy, said, "We do believe there is considerable value in providing users with an open source system to build their own private clouds that match the de facto standard of Amazon's EC2 API."  His justification is that, "These services will be used in enterprise environments and any enterprise wants the reassurance of professional, ongoing support in this case from the code originators, Canonical."

==== Why Ubuntu has become the flag bearer for Linux ====

This entry from techradar.com sees the rise in popularity of Ubuntu as being caused by the marketing strategy of Canonical, the introduction of Live``CDs as a means of installation, and the lack of interest in Windows Vista.  In short, it's saying that Ubuntu entered the distribution scene at just the right time to catch the wave. Read the entire article and get more information at the link.

=== In The Blogosphere ===

==== Canonical’s Private Ubuntu Cloud Strategy: Partners Welcome? ====

The VAR Guy, posting at Works With U, notes with interest that Canonical has launched the Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud Services.  However, he feels that there is something lacking - the independent software vendors (ISVs). It is his opinion that customers don't buy cloud operating systems. They embrace cloud services to host specific applications (storage, backup/recovery, database, ERP, email, etc.).  Canonical needs to promote reliable ISV software stacks for Ubuntu in the cloud.  According to The VAR Guy, "in order to get the word out faster, Canonical needs partners."

==== Five Questions for Dell’s Ubuntu Linux Team ====

Joe Panettieri, at Works With U, is intending to meet with Dell's Ubuntu team members and has posted five questions that he would like to ask them. He also invites readers to add questions by emailing him or posting them as comments to his article.  It's his intent to create an interview that examines Dell's Ubuntu Linux strategy.

==== Three’s Company: Oracle, Ubuntu and OpenOffice ====

The VAR Guy, from Works With U, notes that Matt Asay from CNet had opined that Canonical needed enterprise software partners like Oracle to help with it's move into servers.  The VAR Guy adds one more element into the mix:  Open``Office.org. It's his opinion that Oracle and Canonical could use Open``Office.org to accelerate Ubuntu's desktop momentum, and that this would help the momentum on the server side.

==== Beyond Ubuntu: Canonical Pursues New Revenue Streams ====

http://www.workswithu.com/2009/07/02/beyond-ubuntu-canonical-diversifies-its-revenue-streams/

==== Ubuntu heads to the clouds ====

On July 1, Canonical, the company behind Ubuntu in partnership with Eucalyptus Systems, an open-source cloud infrastructure firm, launched Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud Services. According to sources at Canonical, Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud Services "is a set of new professional services to help and support users building 'private clouds', that is cloud infrastructures behind a corporate firewall." The idea, as it always is with cloud computing is to save organizations money by optimizing server use, while lowering costs and providing end users with self-service IT. With Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud Services, Canonical will help businesses build private clouds. In a statement, Mark Shuttleworth, Canonical's CEO said, "Enterprises are realizing that building 'private clouds' enables them to better manage variable workloads, while reducing the waste of idle servers. Building on an open-source technology also avoids the issue of vendor lock-in. Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud enables businesses to do this--and the addition of these services helps them to do it with confidence." Once more Canonical is showing that, while its reputation is based on Ubuntu, the popular end-user desktop Linux distribution, the company has every intention of competiting with Red Hat and Novell for the business server market.

==== Powerpets, Inc. Head Offices Switch to Ubuntu ====

An unsolicited email to the Ubuntu News Team mailing list from Powerpets, Inc. gives us some insight into one companies "Ubuntu Success Story":

In 2002, a small Canadian company was started based on a small idea and big dreams to create an entertaining virtual world with many educational aspects and a company goal to support and spread awareness of abused and abandoned animals.

Less than half a year into the project, powerpets.com was experiencing explosive growth and an explosive amount of problems, mainly e-mail based viruses. We would be affected by the next big threat, weeks before large AV companies such as Mc``Afee would have a fix for it. More time was spent fixing our Windows based office computers than what was spent working on our business.

A switch to Linux was made, with quite a few hurdles, but it was nice to know once a system was set up, you wouldn't have to worry about it. You wouldn't even need to restart it. Unfortunately last year, our *flavor* of Linux that was chosen for the
office sold out to another company who pretty much abandoned the OS.

Much research went into selecting a new Linux OS that will carry us through the next decade without headaches or an overload of IT expenses. Ubuntu quickly caught our attention. We actually waited for about a month because we could not find an option to purchase one copy of the Ubuntu OS and felt uncomfortable requesting a free CD. Due to our satellite Internet, we were unable to download the OS.

A few weeks later, our CD arrived in the mail. At the time we were involved in several large projects and were unable to perform any installations. It wasn't until June, when an old test laptop was loaded with Ubuntu. The installation went quick and without a hitch, despite hardware being well outdated. The past few days, the remainder of our office went through the overhaul and in a matter of hours we were using Ubuntu. Some changes were hard to get used to, such as the SAMBA shares, but overall everything was a success.

We're very happy with our Ubuntu solution, and we hope to see the number of Ubuntu system builders grow - after all, one Ubuntu system builder to serve over 300 million people in North America may not be sufficient.

Many thanks for the CD and the great experience
