==== Refactor with Clang Tooling at code::dive 2018 ====

Stephen Kelly blogs about his recent talk on his refactoring tool with Clang Tooling at code::dive last November. Stephen got to demo some features which had never been seen by anyone before. For people who are already familiar with clang-tidy and clang-query, the interesting content shows new features in the clang-query interpreter command line, such as syntax highlighting and portable code completion with scrolling through results selections. The post contains numerous usage clips, and links to Stephen's presentation.
