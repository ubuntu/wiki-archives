==== Attention: ZFS kernel panic mitigation ====

"The version of the ZFS driver included in the 5.13.0-19 kernel contains a bug that can result in filesystem corruption. Users of ZFS are advised to wait until the first Stable Release Update of the kernel in 21.10 before upgrading." Trent Lloyd's long standing bug report of the ZFS kernel panic is mitigated with the 5.13.0-20 impish-proposed kernel.
