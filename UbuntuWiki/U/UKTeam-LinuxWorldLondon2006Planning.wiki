Hi, 

Thanks for dropping in and checking out the Linux World 2006 Planning page. Jono has asked me to Co-ordinate the UK Loco team efforts for the attendance of the Linux World 2006 Expo in London. This page will serve as the Diary and Project Management section of the proceeding Linux World London2006 page. Lets keep dates, commitments and direction on this page and ideas, promises and thoughts on the previous page. If you can help, volunteer effort or contribute then post on  Linux World London 2006    . If that idea or contribution is moving forward then it should be posted in here. So lets begin, the headings are very simple since im dragging the content from the previous page and dropping it in. 

Jono pointed this out <nowiki>[[UbuntuAtConferences]]</nowiki> so ive taken on the advice and ordered the some kit and started to ask some questions.

Nik Butler

=== People Responsible for making this Happen ===

We now have sufficient people to man the stand So please edit this document and  Us know which dates you will be avialable and if you will be helping with the breakdown or the set up .

I think it is safe to say that we only need to have two people on the stand for two days at any moment. If we can therefore have at least 3 people on the stand for the day then everyone gets a chance to take a break go see a talk and stretch their legs. I want to make sure the stand is set up and ready the day before so please if have kit to demo get it to us for the setup and be available to help take it away on the last day. One more thing. Id rather have volunteers for breaking down than for setting up so please bear that in mind.. .okay .. now back to you guys.

=== Staffing of the Booth on the Days ===
Everyone of us will want to at some point wander the Show and visit the speeches, talks and discussions so bear it in mind before commiting to being all day on the stand. Similarly someone who can run the refreshments in provide cover for breaks and absence is also required. Can people confirm which part of when they expect to be on stand. It will be first come first served so if your preferred time is blocked, please consider if you can be available at another time.
