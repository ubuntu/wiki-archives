=== Introduction ===

Identify and eliminate inelegant solutions which were implemented due to time/release pressure, and replace them with proper solutions.

=== Rationale ===

=== Scope and Use Cases ===

* debconf TARGETPRIO
* debconf-copydb for cdebconf
* linux-* metapackage selection in base-installer
* copy-dev stuff in casper (depends on the busybox and rootskel bits of InstallerDevfsPaths)

=== Implementation Plan ===

==== Data Preservation and Migration ====

==== Packages Affected ====

==== User Interface Requirements ====

=== Outstanding Issues ===

==== UDU BOF Agenda ====

* Brainstorm: "What code do you have in Hoary which brings you shame?"
* Outline fixes, schedule BOFs for non-trivial topics

==== UDU Pre-Work ====

=== Implementation Status ===

2005-05-31 ColinWatson: debconf-copydb implemented in cdebconf, and all users of workarounds converted to use it instead.
