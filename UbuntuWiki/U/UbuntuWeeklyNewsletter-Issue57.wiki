=== In The Press ===

* March of the penguin: Linux emerges as option for Windows - Shopping for a home computer involves more than just choosing hardware — buyers must also pick what kind of operating system they want to run that new machine. And for most people, that's long meant choosing between Microsoft's Windows, which runs on PCs, or OSX, the system that operates Apple's Macintosh. Enter Linux, an operating system created by Finnish university student Linus Torvalds as a hobby. "Linux has come a long way in the last few years, especially the Ubuntu distribution" CU's Schenk said. "It has all the standard stuff any regular person would need." Most people are looking for multimedia, which can be a difficult to configure in Linux, and there are difficulties in getting Linux to work with wireless systems, Schenk noted. Computers shipped with Linux do not have this difficulty, as they come pre-configured, eliminating the most difficult step in Linux usage. Along with several other companies offering pre-configured linux systems, Dell and System 76 offer Ubuntu Linux pre-installed and pre-configured. Dell offers three models pre-loaded with Ubuntu 7.04 — two desktops and a laptop. Dell plans to offer additional options later this year.http://dailycamera.com/news/2007/sep/10/cover-story-linux-toeing-the-march-of-the/

* Mark Shuttleworth Interview for Software Freedom Day (2007) - Mark Shuttleworth, Cosmonaut and creator of the Ubuntu Linux distribution, answers questions about Open Source software, flying in space, his decision to start Ubuntu, what Ubuntu means, and the progress of Ubuntu and free, open source software. Please click on the link to see the video interview featuring Mark Shuttleworth. http://www.archive.org/details/Mark_Shuttleworth_SFD

* Lenovo opening the door for Ubuntu Think-Pads? - Lenovo finally started shipping SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop on its T-Series ThinkPads for its mainstream business users. Now, the company appears to be considering offering another Linux, very possibly Ubuntu, for the enthusiast market. Matt Kohut, Lenovo's worldwide competitive analyst, writes: "I need to try Ubuntu. One of our competitors, Dell has done so and it seems to be working out for them." Kohut concluded by opening up a survey to see which desktop Linux ThinkPad customers would like Lenovo to offer. The survey, which began on Sept. 7, has in approximately 48 hours already tallied 13,402 votes. Of these votes, the majority (7,196) are for Ubuntu. Trailing far behind Ubuntu is Debian with 1,443 supporters. Third place currently goes to a user suggestion of any Linux "that refuses to carry binary-only drivers, so that all others will also benefit, as it will require documented hardware." Based on the survey results, Ubuntu is clearly the Linux that the enthusiasts want to see from Lenovo. While it's by no means a slam dunk that Lenovo will be offering a Linux-powered laptop for home Linux users, it does seem unlikely that the company would be stirring up excitement for such an offering unless it was giving the matter serious consideration. http://www.desktoplinux.com/news/NS7908457804.html

* Best of open source in platforms and middle ware - For open source client OS, we like Ubuntu Desktop Edition, although we almost hate to say it. Sometimes it seems that Ubuntu is the iPod of Linux distributions. It’s flashy, simple, and easy to work with. It also has legions of fanatical supporters, along with many detractors. It’s unquestionably a great distribution for those just getting into Linux and those who like the eye candy. For others, it’s too simple and too much like a Microsoft OS – but then those are generally the people that run Gentoo and are proud of it. The sheer amount of effort that’s been put into bringing Ubuntu into the mainstream is impressive, and it gets better with every release… now if we can only get the fanboys to tone it down a little.http://www.infoworld.com/article/07/09/10/37FE-boss-platforms_1.html

* Gutsy Gibbon swinging along - There's a month to go before the next Ubuntu release, 7.10 aka Gutsy Gibbon, hits the download servers. A September 4 daily build shows a number of improvements over the 7.04 release which was named Feisty Fawn. The Gibbon has no problems with DHCP, unlike the previous release. On booting up after installation, it picks up an IP address without any problem. What's more, if one changes to a static IP - using the graphical utility provided - the changes take effect immediately. There's no need to resort to the command line. There is no change in the installation procedure but then this was already streamlined and efficient. Every commercial Linux distribution - and I put Ubuntu in this category because it is produced by a company named Canonical - has to plow a fine path between the free software crowd and the open source backers. In keeping with this balancing act, Ubuntu provides proprietary drivers from NVIDIA for its graphic cards but these have to be installed after the system is up and running - it is not part of the default install. 3D effects have been promised; Mark Shuttleworth, the head of Canonical, said Compiz Fusion would be integrated, barring any last-minute issues that show up in beta testing or upstream. Gibbon also includes a desktop search tool, which Shuttleworth said was meant to provide "fast access to any of your files without needing to navigate through directories." A desk bar applet to provide "quicksilver-like instant-command access to web sites, web services, local search etc" is also present. http://www.itwire.com/content/view/14400/1090/

* Ubuntu expands into virtual appliances - Canonical has released a special version of its Ubuntu Server Linux distribution that is tailored to run as part of a virtual appliance. Dubbed Ubuntu JeOS (Just Enough Operating System), the software has been stripped from drivers and utilities that are bundled with the regular Ubuntu Server distribution. There is no need for hardware drivers in a virtual system, and utilities are typically available in a server's main operating system. If an application requires a specific component, Ubuntu can quickly add that from one of the Ubuntu Server packages, Canonical chief executive Mark Shuttleworth told vnunet.com. The Ubuntu JeOS (pronounced 'juice') kernel has been optimized to run on VMware. Other virtualization platforms may be added based on customer demand.http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2198483/ubuntu-expands-virtual

* Linux’s Free System Is Now Easier to Use, But Not for Everyone (By: Walt Mossberg) - This column is written for mainstream, nontechie users of digital technology. These folks aren’t necessarily novices, and they aren’t afraid of computers. They also aren’t stupid. They simply want their digital products to operate as promised, with as little maintenance and hassle as possible. So, I have steered away from recommending Linux, the free computer operating system that is the darling of many techies and IT managers, and a challenger to Microsoft’s dominant Windows and Apple’s resurgent Macintosh operating system, OS X. Linux, which runs on the same hardware as Windows, has always required much more technical expertise and a yen for tinkering than average users possess. Lately, however, I’ve received a steady stream of emails from readers urging me to take a look at a variant of Linux called Ubuntu, which, these folks claimed, is finally polished enough for a mainstream user to handle. My interest increased when Dell began to sell a few computer models preloaded with Ubuntu instead of Windows. I’ve been testing one of those Dell Ubuntu computers, a laptop called the Inspiron 1420N. I evaluated it strictly from the point of view of an average user, someone who wouldn’t want to enter text commands, hunt the Web for drivers and enabling software, or learn a whole new user interface. I focused on Ubuntu and the software programs that come bundled with it, not on the hardware, which is a pretty typical Dell laptop. My verdict: Even in the relatively slick Ubuntu variation, Linux is still too rough around the edges for the vast majority of computer users. While Ubuntu looks a lot like Windows or Mac OS X, it is full of little complications and hassles that will quickly frustrate most people who just want to use their computers, not maintain or tweak them. Before every passionate Linux fan attacks that conclusion, let me note that even the folks who make and sell Ubuntu agree with it. Mark Shuttleworth, the South African-born founder of the Ubuntu project, told me this week that “it would be reasonable to say that this is not ready for the mass market.” And Dell’s Web site for its Ubuntu computers warns that these machines are for “for advanced users and tech enthusiasts.” http://ptech.allthingsd.com/20070913/linuxs-free-system-is-now-easier-to-use-but-not-for-everyone/

* Ubuntu comes knocking on Oracle's door - Canonical has stated that its Ubuntu Server needs increased support from independent software vendors and system builders. "The acid test for Ubuntu Server is Oracle," Canonical chief executive Mark Shuttleworth told vnunet.com in an interview at the VMworld 2007 conference in San Francisco. Ubuntu is best known for its desktop Linux distribution which Dell ships on its consumer Linux desktop PCs, but the group is seeing increasing interest in its server version that was launched in 2005. Certification for third-party applications such as Oracle's database is considered critical for the continued growth of Canonical's support services. Ubuntu Server is currently starting to move up the chain in areas such as high performance computing, but the final missing piece is support from hardware vendors.http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2198580/ubuntu-comes-knocking-oracle

=== In The Blogosphere ===

* Ubuntu's Hype is Misleading - I'm running a computer institute and I have new, middle and advanced users.  Recently, I've been trying different distros. Trying a distro is always based on the reviews I read on the web. Most of the reviews are based on the stability and performance but none of them I found which is meant for a normal user who is a new user in the Linux world. This time I thought, lets do it practically, give different distros to my people in the Institute and get their opinion. For this I chose Ubuntu, PCLOS 2007, Dreamlinux, and Mandriva One. The most misleading hype I got is about Ubuntu. They say that "Its a replacement fof Windows", "Windows users will feel they are in home". I don't know why they have created such hype when its not at all true.  Its bad marketing and not ethical. I agree that Ubuntu is the largest community and they have a stable OS, but back to the reality, I'm testing different distros from the normal user point of view. Users who'll like Linux and leave Windows, means it should be as easy as Windows for them. I've given each distro a day and asked everybody to do their daily work on it. Ubuntu 7.04: Well, what to say about this distro? It's hyped that it's for the users who are switching from Windows. I gave it to my users for a day and here is how they responded. One guy told me that, "If this is what best Linux is, I'll never move from Windows because its not as user friendly as PCLOS & Dreamlinux". All ten testers reported that it is running slower than Windows on the same machines. It doesn't support any proprietary tools or software out of the box and for many things you need to know the Linux command, it expects you to go back to the command line and do some tweaking there. The experiences of my users were not good, they said it's not at all user friendly and it's slower and doesn't act like Windows at any point. It's not a replacement of Windows, they said. "It could be a stable OS but I'll never move to Ubuntu even if it's the only distro in the Linux world." They also said that they would prefer "Mandriva One over Ubuntu 7.04 because it's at least faster and it doesn't expect users to go to the command line." So the overall review of Ubuntu was the worst from new user point of view and PCLOS wins here. My users say that in their opinion, Ubuntu is over hyped and that it's not for the normal user. It is for those users who know Linux very well and have high end systems with at least 1 gig ram.http://mag.mypclinuxos.com/html/Issues/200709/page02.html (maybe put under news?)

* Ubuntu On The Road To Bloat - I boot my Ubuntu laptop and log in. Shortly after logging in, the IO onslaught begins. I open up a terminal and 'top' exposes the offender 'trackerd'. I begin the motion to kill it. This is a familiar sequence for me, something I have done every day since, well, so long ago I can't remember the exact day I started doing it. A few weeks, at least. Today I hesitate. I have been impatient, unforgiving, and dismissive of Tracker - the application 'trackerd' serves - because of how it renders my PC unusable. I usually 'kill' it so I can resume my daily online routine, but today I decide to wait it out, to let it run it's course. This means I can't browse the web. Well, perhaps I can, but not using Opera which is my browser of choice. For while 'trackerd' is indexing my home folder, Opera hangs for up to 10s at a time. This is not actually the fault of either Tracker or Opera, but instead a consequence of poor Linux kernel releases which have occurred at an unfortunate time for Ubuntu because the Ubuntu team have chosen one of them for Gutsy and are stubbornly in their refusal to take a chance on next, imminent kernel release. I sense that my current frustrations are soon to be borne out across the globe on the desktops of users who do not have the knowledge to deal with it. It must be said that I am using Gutsy Gibbon, the development version of Ubuntu. So I should anticipate some problems, but it's not problems for me that I'm worried about. I've been using Linux for years. I can fix something if I really have to, I can tweak my system and solve my problems. It is those making the transition from Windows to Linux that I am worried about. I've been using Linux for years. I can fix something if I really have to, I can tweak my system and solve my problems. It is those making the transition from Windows to Linux that I am worried about. They hear how stable and wonderful Linux is, but then boot into something that is attacking their hard drive from day one. That's not a good impression to make.http://thefreedesktop.blogspot.com/2007/09/ubuntu-on-road-to-bloat.html
