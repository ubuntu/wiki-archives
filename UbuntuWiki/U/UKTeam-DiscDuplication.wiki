=== Goals ===

* List CD / DVD Duplicators willing to provide copies of Edgy Eft in lieu of ShipIt.

=== Issue ===

ShipIt is only currently providing free copies of 6.06 LTS Dapper Drake, so gaining copies of 6.10 Edgy Eft is more difficult if planning to use large numbers of discs for promotional purposes, i.e. at LUGs, install fests, etc.

=== Solution ===

Provide a list of (possibly approved) duplicators within the UK who can offer reasonably priced, if not free, copies Edgy Eft for the above purposes.

=== Suggestions ===
