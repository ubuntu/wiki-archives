== Goal ==

We now have most of the building blocks to support encrypted removable storage.<nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/EncryptedStorage|wiki page]]</nowiki> for status and details. However, some critical integration pieces are missing and should be discussed.

== Requirements ==

* Allow mounting of devmapper devices with pmount. 
* Implement a safe way to setup encrypted device (requires root privileges) as user.

== Agenda ==

* Discuss how to extend pmount to allow mounting of devmapper devices on top of removable devices.
* Discuss how to wrap `cryptsetup-luks` as user.

This will probably not take a very long time (30 minutes should be enough), but I'd like to hear some more opinions.
 
== Pre-Work ==
 
* See <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/EncryptedStorage|wiki page]]</nowiki> for status and details.
* Detection in hal works.
* Setup with `cryptsetup-luks` works manually (as root).
* Mounting the decrypted devmapper device works (as root).
