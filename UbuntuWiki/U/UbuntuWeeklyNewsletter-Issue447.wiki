=== General Community News ===

==== Ubuntu is about people ====

David Planella writes a retrospective post about the history of collaboration with a view on past and now discontinued in-person Ubuntu Developer Summit events and the rise of community-organized Ubu``Con in their wake, writing: “while over the years we have learnt to work productively in a remote environment, the need to socialize is still there and as important as ever to reaffirm this bonding that keep us together.” He goes on to bring these topics together as he talks about the Ubu``Con Summit, “a super-Ubu``Con” with “some of the most influential members of the wider Ubuntu community, with first-class talks content, and with a space for discussions to help shape the future of particular areas of Ubuntu. It’s the evolution of an Ubu``Con.” His post concludes with some details about the upcoming Ubu``Con Summit in Pasadena, free registration information and more.

=== In The Blogosphere ===

==== Convergence Is About Ubuntu Phones Turning into Desktops and Desktops into Phones ====

Silviu Stahie of Softpedia shares a perspective, fueled by the computing power of phones today, that looking forward phones and desktops will be interchangeable. He predicts: “In a couple more years, we will probably switch systems altogether; we'll be using our desktop computers for regular work, and at the end of the day, they turn into regular phones.”

==== Zero-Day GRUB2 Vulnerability Hits Linux Users, Patch Available for Ubuntu, RHEL ====

Marius Nestor of Softpedia reports on the recent zero-day GRUB2 vulnerability that all supported Ubuntu releases were patched for on December 15th. The vulnerability was caused by a bug in “upstream GRUB2 packages, which not correctly handled the backspace key when the bootloader was configured to use password-protected authentication, thus allowing a local attacker to bypass GRUB's password protection.” He concludes by providing a link to Hector Marco’s report on the vulnerability.
