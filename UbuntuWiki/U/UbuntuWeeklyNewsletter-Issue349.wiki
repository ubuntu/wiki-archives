==== Kubuntu Wire: Kubuntu 13.10.. On a Lenovo Ultrabook ====

Danny Snowman writes about the installation of Kubuntu on a Lenovo T431 ultrabook, writing: “Ultrabooks are an Intel developed specification or brand for high end laptops that are lightweight. There’s no ultrabooks that are preinstalled with Linux yet, but that doesn’t mean you can’t install your favorite linux distribution on it.”

http://wire.kubuntu.org/?p=121

==== Victor Tuson Palau: Developing for Android and Ubuntu – with the same phone ====

Victor Palau informs us that he has been dual-booting Android and Ubuntu on the same device, as a user and as a developer. Victor mentions briefly some of the advantages in dual booting and says that he hopes to see more integration between both development environments.

http://victorpalau.net/2013/12/23/developing-for-android-and-ubuntu-with-the-same-phone/

==== Benjamin Kerensa: Ubuntu’s Addiction to Dual-Booting ====

Benjamin Kerensa writes "I was disappointed to see Canonical push a release of Ubuntu Touch that allows users to Dual-Boot to Android." Benjamin goes on to say that Ubuntu has made significant progress of what users expect on their desktop, but he feels that Mark Shuttleworth didn't envision Ubuntu as being a platform that required its users to dual-boot in order to fulfill their computing needs.

==== Jonathan Riddell: Photo Retrospective: Ubuntu ====

Jonathan Riddell writes "I'm done triaging old photos, here's some of my favourite Ubuntu themed ones from 2005 to 2009."

==== Sean Davis: LightDM GTK+ Greeter 1.7.0 Released ====

Sean Davis writes that the first development release leading to Light``DM GTK+ Greeter version 1.8 has been made available. Sean lists the new features, improvements and bug fixes, provides some screenshots, and informs us how the development release can be installed.

http://www.jorgecastro.org/2014/01/02/nginx-coming-to-main-in-14-dot-04/

==== Jono Bacon: Ubuntu In 2014 ====

Jono Bacon briefly looks at 2013 which he says was a phenomenal year for Ubuntu. Jono says that 2014 will bring a single platform code-base for phone, tablet, and desktop that adapts to each device on which it runs, and that 2014 will be the year when we see this new era of Ubuntu convergence shipping to consumers. He ends his post with "... my goal is to help keep us working together as a community, keep us focused on the bigger picture, keep our discourse constructive, and to keep the fun in Ubuntu."

http://www.jonobacon.org/2014/01/02/ubuntu-in-2014/

==== Nathan Haines: Which version of Ubuntu do I install? ====

Nathan Haines asks himself which version of Ubuntu to install, 12.04 LTS or 13.10? He looks at user experience, available software updates, and the online search capability but discounts installing 14.04 LTS. Nathan concludes "So the next time you recommend Ubuntu to a friend, consider offering them Ubuntu 13.10, and give them an experience that really showcases why we love Ubuntu and Free Software."
