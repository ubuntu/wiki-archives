== Introduction ==
<nowiki>[[UbuntuGNOME | Ubuntu GNOME]]</nowiki> Team is still a young team, yet very fast growing with lots of activities in different areas and moving forward with solid steps. In order to support such rapid growth and improve it even better, we have decided to establish a new area called <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstorming | The Brainstorming]]</nowiki> Area, which is going to be our newest <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuGNOME/SubTeams | sub-team]]</nowiki> starting 1-11-2013. This new area will help us to carry on with confidence and facilitate our mission for 14.04 Cycle and the future ones. This team will work closely with each and every sub-team of Ubuntu GNOME.

The purpose of this team/new area is:

# To Encourage everyone to participate and contribute to Ubuntu GNOME
# By coming up with an idea
# Do a Brainstorming on this idea by the whole team
# Which will eventually lead to a creative and almost perfect result or solution

So, what we do is simple yet very important: Create an idea > Discuss it as a team > Improve it > Finalize it > Find the best and the perfect solution to anything.

== Motto ==
Our Motto is:

'''All of us are smarter than any one of us!'''
