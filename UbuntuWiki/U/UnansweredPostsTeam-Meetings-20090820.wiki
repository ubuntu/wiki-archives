    <bodhi_zazen> ### START MEETING ###
    <bodhi_zazen> As always, thank you all for coming to the meeting
    <bodhi_zazen> The concern I have with the UA team is , due to life, ajmorris has does not seem able to provide as much leadership as this team needs
    <bodhi_zazen> He pops in, but then is busy for several weeks / dare I say months ?
    <bodhi_zazen> So I would like to identify say two people to lead this team in his absence and coordinate with him
    <bodhi_zazen> I believe Hellow and panickedthumb have both expressed an interest in leadership
    <bodhi_zazen> Anybody else interested or does anybody want to put up nominations ?
    <bodhi_zazen> Any other options for providing leadership on this team in aj's absence ?
*** jacob thinks they'll both do great
    <bodhi_zazen>  /end wall of text
    <Hellow> :)
    <dmizer> i'm mostly here to put my +1 behind Hellow.
    <bodhi_zazen> OK, I will look on the forums to put PT and Hellow as Team Leaders
    <bodhi_zazen> Hellow: this should give you some additional options on the forums
    <bodhi_zazen> you should be able to look at the "join requests"
    <Hellow> Ah, ok :)

    <Hellow> That's going around pretty fast

    <Hellow> For some reason, BBQ sauce and fries taste good together.
    <Rocket2DMn> that's just b/c BBQ sauce is good
    <jacob> why wouldn't it?
    <jacob> BBQ sauce is also good on grilled cheese
    <jacob> ...with bacon bits

    <Hellow> (thats a reference to http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/thinking_ahead.png)
    <jacob> :D
    <PartyBoi2> what happened to the meeting?
    <jacob> netsplit kinda killed it
    <jacob> we certainly could continue
    <starcraftman> Hellow: doesn't seem like bodhi's coming back.... maybe ya should go on.
    <PartyBoi2> I agree
    <Hellow> Ok
    <starcraftman> I'm not in a rush though tbh, I got nothing in particular planned, just poking round forums and admiring the squirrel infestation.
    <Hellow> Erm.. wait, there is nothing to go on to :o
    <PartyBoi2> what about the merge of Ua with BT?
    <starcraftman> PartyBoi2: that was the other thing he mentioned, after leadership. I imagine he wanted a discussion and vote from members on the idea.
    <Hellow> Its not really something that can be discussed in individual team meetings, but only in a joint team meeting.
    <Hellow> I would prefer to get input from both teams at the same time, but I personally do not see a purpose of joining us and the BT.
    <PartyBoi2> U agree but if the UA team is happy to do this, then it can be discussed at the BT meeting
    <PartyBoi2> *I
    <starcraftman> Hellow: bt already kinda voted on it, if I recall right, we split half in favour and half abstained.
    <Hellow> Hrm
    <Hellow> Well, lets hold out for a joint meeting so we can decide in unison
    <starcraftman> Hellow: was just more of an informal poll, not binding of course.
    <PartyBoi2> I have no problems with the merge, I think it is a good idea
    <jacob> I'd argue for the joining personally, provides greater strength in numbers. But I agree in needing a joint decision.
    <starcraftman> Hellow: if you want a joint meeting, next bt meet is 25, you should add agenda and ensure members show.
    <Hellow> I will
    <PartyBoi2> but is the current UA behind the idea?
    <Hellow> That is what I wish to find out at the meeting
    <starcraftman> shouldn't all your active ua members be here?
    <Hellow> Basically :P
    <PartyBoi2> you can add my +1 at the meeting then, I can not attend those meetings due to work commitments
    <jacob> many UA members are on BT as well iirc
*** w4ett_ has quit ("ChatZilla 0.9.85 [Firefox 3.0.13/2009080316]")
    <Hellow> My argument is that the two teams do not have much in common, besides overlapping members.
    <starcraftman> jacob: right, I'm just a bt member fyi, though I was thinking of joining a while back.

    <starcraftman> bodhi_zazen: he returns :)
*** dmizer (n=dmizer@unaffiliated/dmizer) has joined #ubuntuforums-unanswered
    <Hellow> bodhi_zazen: OMGWTFBBQLOL
    <bodhi_zazen> dam that was one huge netsplit
    <bodhi_zazen> anyone still here ?
    <bodhi_zazen> Hellow: poke
    <PartyBoi2> wb bodhi_zazen
    <bodhi_zazen> thanks
    <starcraftman> Rocket2DMn: poke
    <bodhi_zazen> wb dmizer
    <dmizer> bodhi_zazen it was just us ...
    <dmizer> lol
    <bodhi_zazen> yep
    <bodhi_zazen> Hellow: what can you access on the fourms now ?
    <bodhi_zazen> The other question for this team is -
    <bodhi_zazen> merge with BT or remain independent ?
    <Hellow> Independent, I would prefer
    <Hellow> And, nothing much :P
    <Hellow> I see no new options on the forums
    <bodhi_zazen> log off an back on please Hellow
    <dmizer> Hellow: i initially agreed with you about being independent, but the BT has some interesting possibilities that i was not aware of.
    <Rocket2DMn> starcraftman, sorry, was in the shower
    <starcraftman> Rocket2DMn: no problemo, bodhi and dmizer are back.
    <Rocket2DMn> groovy
    <Hellow> bodhi_zazen: Where would it be at?
    <Hellow> dmizer: I don't think the BT and UT have very much in common.
    <bodhi_zazen> Hellow: look in your user CP
    <starcraftman> dmizer: care to elaborate on your possibilities? I'm just curious.
    <dmizer> Hellow: the BT appears to be so much more than it used to be when i first joined UA.
    <Hellow> bodhi_zazen: Nothing yet
    <Hellow> dmizer: The BT is more focused on Beginners; the UT is much more general.
    <dmizer> Hellow: yes, that's what i thought too, but bodhi_zazen has explained how much the scope of BT has changed.
    <dmizer> they have focus groups for specific areas of the forums.
    <Hellow> dmizer: I would still prefer we remain independent :P
    <PartyBoi2> should we vote?
    <bodhi_zazen> Try again Hellow
    <dmizer> i think being part of the BT would give us access to resources, leadership, and support that would only benefit UA.
    <PartyBoi2> +1 dmizer
    <dmizer> Hellow: i used to see an advantage of being independent. what are your thoughts on remaining independent?
    <Hellow> Works now
    <Hellow> dmizer: The team would remain sovereign, and we would probably gain more members by being a individual team rather than being a subsidiary of another team.
    <tuxxy> I agree with Hellow +1
    <Hellow> bodhi_zazen: I appear to have lost my Ubuntu Member status on the forums :P
    <bodhi_zazen> Hellow: can you see the join requests ?
    <bodhi_zazen> Hellow: you can have only one =)
    <Hellow> bodhi_zazen: Under where?
    <bodhi_zazen> but let me look
    <Hellow> bodhi_zazen: Moderation?
    <bodhi_zazen> jacob: can you access the join requests on the forums ?
    <dmizer> Hellow: currently, the UA team is (at best) an unknown except to current membership. how do you propose we change this?
    <jacob> bodhi_zazen: don't believe I can
    <bodhi_zazen> Hellow: under User CP
    <jacob> Hellow: http://ubuntuforums.org/profile.php?do=editusergroups see the bottom to re-enable membership thing
    <bodhi_zazen> go to "Group Memberships"
    <Hellow> I'm there
    <jacob> "You are a leader of the following groups" will be shown if it's all set right
    <bodhi_zazen> Do you see yourself listed as a leader of any groups ?
    <Hellow> No
    <Hellow> dmizer: Primarily try to promote the team, through various ways
    <Hellow> dmizer: More general activity in the community would assist that
    <Hellow> brb
    <Hellow> back
    <dmizer> Hellow: since the BT already has a high profile, it should make promotion a breeze.
    <bodhi_zazen> Hellow: Do you want me to take a vote from the team on if they wish to merge with the BT ?
    <Hellow> dmizer: To join the team, they would have to join the BT first.
    <Hellow> bodhi_zazen: Go ahead.
    <bodhi_zazen> ### VOTE ###
    <tuxxy> I dont see why we need to promote a background team, if we needed new recruits we could easily select current good forum members/helpers
    <bodhi_zazen> Do you wish to join the BT : options +1 / -1 / 0
    <Hellow> -1
    <Rocket2DMn> 0
    <PartyBoi2> +1
    <bodhi_zazen> 0
    <dmizer> +1
    <tuxxy> -1
    <jacob> +1
    <linuxwizard> -1
    <starcraftman> 0
    <Hellow> Everyone in?
    <jacob> well that certainly doesn't get us anywhere :P
    <starcraftman> Dead even ha.
    <PartyBoi2> lol
    <dmizer> lol ...
    <starcraftman> 3 of everything
    <Hellow> bodhi_zazen: Endvote :P
    <tuxxy> with aj though it would have been rejected
    <dmizer> bodhi_zazen: would you need to be a member of BT to work UA if UA was a focus group?
    <bodhi_zazen> ### End vote ###
     
    There's not much else relevant to the meeting after this, so I just excluded it.
