==== Lucid Alpha 3 Released ====

Welcome to Lucid Lynx Alpha 3, which will in time become Ubuntu 10.04 LTS.

Pre-releases of Lucid are *not* encouraged for anyone needing a stable system or anyone who is not comfortable running into occasional, even frequent breakage. They are, however, recommended for Ubuntu developers and those who want to help in testing, reporting, and fixing bugs.

Alpha 3 is the third in a series of milestone CD images that will be released throughout the Lucid development cycle.  The Alpha images are known to be reasonably free of showstopper CD build or installer bugs, while representing a very recent snapshot of Lucid. You can download it here:

* http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/lucid/alpha-3/ (Ubuntu)
* http://uec-images.ubuntu.com/releases/lucid/alpha-3/ (Ubuntu Server for UEC and EC2)
* http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/releases/lucid/alpha-3/ (Kubuntu)
* http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/xubuntu/releases/lucid/alpha-3/ (Xubuntu)
* http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/edubuntu/releases/lucid/alpha-3/ (Edubuntu)
* http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/mythbuntu/releases/lucid/alpha-3/ (Mythbuntu)
* http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntustudio/releases/lucid/alpha-3/ (Ubuntu Studio)

See http://wiki.ubuntu.com/Mirrors for a list of mirrors.

Alpha 3 includes a number of software updates that are ready for wider testing. Please refer to http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/lucid/alpha3 for information on changes in Ubuntu.

This is quite an early set of images, so you should expect some bugs. For a list of known bugs (that you don't need to report if you encounter), please see: http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/lucid/alpha3

==== Rocking The Opportunistic Desktop ====

Here are some fun opportunistic developer things going on over the next few weeks. All of these events provide a great opportunity to get started having fun making awesome apps that you can share with others.

1. Ubuntu Opportunistic Developer Week

* Ubuntu Opportunistic Developer Week Wiki: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuOpportunisticDeveloperWeek

A few weeks ago Jono Bacon announced the plan to put together Ubuntu Opportunistic Developer Week: a week of IRC tuition sessions aimed at helping opportunistic developers scratch their itches and write fun and useful programs using our awesome platform. The week takes place from 1st – 6th March 2010.

The response so far to the call for sessions has been fantastic, and we already have the following sessions scheduled, all visible from the timetable for the week:

* Welcome! Ubuntu For Opportunistic Developers – Jono Bacon
* Gooey Graphics with Goo``Canvas – Rick Spencer
* Testdrive – Dustin Kirkland
* CouchDB support in your app with Desktop``Couch – Stuart Langridge
* Creating stunning interfaces with Cairo – Laszlo Pandy
* Hot-rod your app for translations support – David Planella
* Creating a Py``KDE app – Rich Johnson
* Creating an application from scratch with Quickly – Rick Spencer
* Microblog from your app with the Gwibber API – Ken Van``Dine
* What’s new in Quickly 0.4 – Didier Roche
* Learning through examples with Acire and Python-Snippets – Jono Bacon
* Building in Application Indicator support – Sense Hofstede
* Writing a Rhythmbox plug-in – Stuart Langridge
* Create games with Py``Game – Rick Spencer
* Write Beautiful Code (and Maintain it Beautifully) – rockstar
* Using GTK+ signals in Python – Sense Hofstede
* Integrated development workflow with Ground Control – Martin Owens
* Building multimedia into your app with GStreamer – Laszlo Pandy
* Speed your development with quickly.widgets – Rick Spencer
* Web browsing and rapid UI with Web``Kit – Ryan Paul

Each of these sessions is designed to give you a taste of the topic and get you up and running, enough to be productive and start exploring the features of the tool being discussed. In addition to this we will have a series of showcase sessions:

* SHOWCASE: Gwibber – Ken Van``Dine
* SHOWCASE: Lernid – Jono Bacon
* SHOWCASE: Photobomb – Rick Spencer

These sessions explain the story behind the app: talking about which tools, modules and technology that was used to put these apps together and what challenges were solved. This is a great way to learn more about tools available for opportunistic developers so that when you need to do something, you know which tool to reach out for.

2. Introduction To Python Tuition Sessions

Now, many of you will be entirely new to Python and entirely new to coding. To give you folks a head start before Ubuntu Opportunistic Developer Week kicks off, Rick Spencer from the desktop team will be running some beginners Python tuition sessions on the Thursday before Ubuntu Opportunistic Developer Week:

* Thu 25th Feb 2010 – 15.00 UTC – Ubuntu Opp Dev Week Prep: Intro to Python for total beginners – Rick Spencer
* Thu 25th Feb 2010 – 16.00 UTC – Ubuntu Opp Dev Week Prep: Intro to Python for programmers – Rick Spencer

This is a great way of getting your opportunistic development kickstarted!

Again, this awesome content is best experienced using Lernid. If you would prefer to use a normal IRC client, just join #ubuntu-classroom and #ubuntu-classroom-chat to join in the fun.

3. Fun Apps And Hacking Parties

With an awesome week of opportunistic developer learning ahead of us, I was keen to put together some sessions where you good folks can just hack on fun projects in the same room, ask each other questions and more. As such, at the end of each Opportunistic Developer Week day, there will be a a series of parties. These include:

* Mon 1st March 2010 – 21.00 – 23.00UTC – Hacking Party – Work on your app together, ask/answer questions and have fun together!
* Tues 2nd March 2010 – 21.00 – 23.00UTC – Hacking Party – Work on your app together, ask/answer questions and have fun together!
* Wed 3rd March 2010 – 21.00 – 23.00UTC – Hacking Party – Work on your app together, ask/answer questions and have fun together!
* Thu 4th March 2010 – 21.00 – 23.00UTC – Snippets Party – Join us and create Python snippets!\
* Fri 5th March 2010 – 21.00 – 23.00UTC – Hacking Party – Work on your app together, ask/answer questions and have fun together!

This is an awesome opportunity to get together and make something fun. So, Jono has issued a challenge for you good folks: before we start next week, think of a fun app to focus on writing next week. Pick something that will do something useful for you and something not too large and comprehensive (e.g. don’t pick a word processor or spreadsheet!).

4. The Place To Be: #ubuntu-app-devel

As part of building an awesome community and platform for opportunistic developers, Jono created #ubuntu-app-devel on Freenode and we have a great group of enthusiastic developers in there who can answer your questions and help you get started. Join us and join in the fun!

==== Can you hear the music? ====

Well probably not yet, but the Ubuntu One Music Store is right around the corner.

The team has made great progress since we announced this new Ubuntu feature just a few short months ago at UDSLucid in Dallas. That session was very important for a couple of reasons. It confirmed the community’s interest in having easy access to popular music from within an Ubuntu application. It was also an excellent opportunity to learn some of the community’s concerns and desires. We think we’ve built a music store that everyone will enjoy using at the launch of Ubuntu 10.04 and as it evolves in the future.

There have been some great discussions in blogs and blog comments since bits of the store started appearing in Lucid Lynx Alphas. Now that Lucid Lynx has just passed the Alpha 3 milestone, we thought it was a good time to give everyone a quick update.

The store is currently being thoroughly tested by a small group of users. After we fix some of the initial bugs, we’ll expand testing to a larger group. This should be in the next few weeks. In the meantime, we’ve prepared an FAQ for everyone to learn more about the upcoming music store. Additional information about expanded testing will be posted here so follow this blog or our posts on identi.ca and twitter for more information.

=== LoCo News ===

==== Ubuntu Libya LoCo at the Technology & Science Fair ====

Starting a new local community group requires a mixture of dedication, enthusiastic people and the will to make things happen. And having fun at it. The folks at the Ubuntu Libyan Lo``Co seem to have all the ingredients for the recipe to success and are showing them off on their way to becoming an approved Lo``Co team.

Ubuntu is the most used distro in Libya, and the team was born with the lofty goal of supporting the Ubuntu users in the country. Since they first joined the Ubuntu family in Karmic, a lot new members have joined in. They’ve participated in a great deal of workshops, meetings and discussions, which allowed them to shape the team’s plans and goals.

While doing that, they’ve also participated in educational events organized by local universities and private educational institutes, and we’re going to focus in one of them.

As part of its activities and ongoing strive to increase the knowledge of GNU/Linux and Open Source Software, the Ubuntu Libya Lo``Co Team participated in the Technology & Science Fair, organized by The Libyan Information Technology Group during the week of Dec 6th-12th 2009 and hosted by the Al-Fateh University in Tripoli, Libya.

The Libyan Information Technology Group kindly provided a dedicated booth for the Ubuntu Libya Lo``Co``Team, with an elegant and attractive black and orange Ubuntu theme that clearly stood out in the Fair.

During the period of the Fair, the Libya Lo``Co``Team distributed 500 Ubuntu Karmic CDs to visiting students, IT specialists, Instructors and IT consultants. An Ubuntu installation workshop was also organized by the team after an introductory presentation about Ubuntu.

Many visitors were interested to know more about Ubuntu and Open Source Software and this event was a great opportunity for the Ubuntu Libya Lo``Co``Team to spread their knowledge and enthusiasm.

Their next event is going to be Libya’s first installfest, for which they’ve set themselves a target of 1000 attendees.

==== David Planella: Help localization testing with the ISO tracker ====

The Ubuntu Testing Team  is currently testing Lucid Alpha 3 candidate images.

* Testing Team Wiki: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing
* Testing Lucid Alpha 3 images

This cycle we have a brand new set of localization test cases for everyone to check and make sure language support in Lucid is top notch, and we need your help!

Here’s how you can contribute; the procedure for testing is very easy, and it involves:

* Signing up – create an account at the ISO testing tracker and log in
* Running the test cases – run the localization test cases following the given steps
* Reporting – report on them (pass/fail, comments, bugs, etc.)

If you are interested in helping out, please visit the link below for in-depth instructions on how to set up your own testing tracker.

http://davidplanella.wordpress.com/2010/02/24/help-localization-testing-with-the-iso-tracker/

==== David Planella: Translating software descriptions with Nightmonkey ====

Nightmonkey: http://go2.wordpress.com/?id=725X1342&site=davidplanella.wordpress.com&url=http%3A%2F%2Fnightmonkey.ubuntu.hu%2F

What’s this?

Nightmonkey is a project created and driven by the Ubuntu Hungarian team to allow an easier translation of the descriptions of packages, with István Nyitrai as the main developer and rockstar.

These are the short and long texts used to describe what a particular software package does. They are shown in different places in the system, most notably on Software Center when you are looking at an application’s info page.
Why is this so cool?

For multiple reasons. Let me just mention a few:

* It’s a community project around translations, providing an alternative view to translatable packages in Launchpad. This makes them more discoverable and eases the translation process.
* It was designed with upstream collaboration in mind. István and Michael Vogt made a great effort to ensure these translations can be sent back to Debian.
* It’s very easy to use, and it allows filtering translations according to popularity, so that translators can focus their work on the descriptions of most important applications.
* It is a great tool for teams to set translation goals and use it for Translation Jams, for example.

Can I contribute to it?

Well of course!, Nightmonkey is Open Source, and you can:

*** Translate it: https://translations.launchpad.net/ddtp-lp-html
*** Improve it: https://code.launchpad.net/ddtp-lp-html
*** Report bugs: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ddtp-lp-html
*** Ask and answer questions: https://answers.launchpad.net/ddtp-lp-html

==== Dustin Kirkland: Attention Encrypted Home Users ====

We're rapidly pushing toward an excellent Ubuntu 10.04 LTS release, and we have made a few improvements in the way your Encrypted Home's metadata is stored.

If you configured your Encrypted Home with Ubuntu 9.10 (Karmic) or Ubuntu 10.04 (Lucid), then no action is required, -- you may stop reading here.

If you're not sure, and you want to check if you need to read this article, take a look at your /var/lib/ecryptfs directory. If that directory is empty, or it does not exist, you may stop reading here. If that directory has contents, then you may want to continue reading...

Ubuntu 9.04 (Jaunty) Encrypted Home installations stored eCryptfs metadata in /var/lib/ecryptfs/$USER. This information is absolutely required to mount your Encrypted Home Directory. Actually, everything in here can be re-created if you wrote down your randomly generated mount passphrase!

    Big fat reminder here ... please be absolutely certain that you have recorded your mount passphrase, on a piece of paper, stored somewhere safely, separate from your computer! You can retrieve your randomly generated passphrase by running the ecryptfs-unwrap-passphrase utility.

For Ubuntu 9.10 (Karmic), new installs actually put this metadata in /home/.ecryptfs/$USER. This is far more convenient for users who put all of /home on its own partition, or for users who just simply backup all of /home.

I've previously written about how to move your metadata out of /var/lib/ecryptfs. Particularly if you're planning a Lucid upgrade of a system that was originally installed with Jaunty's Encrypted Home Directory, I strongly recommend that you follow these instructions: http://blog.dustinkirkland.com/2009/08/moving-your-encrypted-home-meta-data.html

http://blog.dustinkirkland.com/2010/02/attention-encrypted-home-users.html

==== Dustin Kirkland: Server Bug Zapping - Call for Participation ====

In October 2009, just before the release of Ubuntu 9.10 (Karmic), Mathias Gug, Dan Nurmi, and I holed up for a couple of very long days, working on the Ubuntu Eucalyptus package. Over the course of 72 hours, we uploaded Eucalyptus 7 times, fixing over 30 bugs! While Mathias, Dan, and I were co-located, we were also greatly assisted by Thierry Carrez (located +7 hours ahead) and community member Joseph Salisbury. Thierry and Joe helped tremendously with regression testing of the rapid fire uploads, triaging and squashing any new issues as they arose. This "push" was essential to delivering UEC for Ubuntu 9.10!

Well, the Server Team is going to do it again, for Ubuntu 10.04, and covering several other important server packages in addition to Eucalyptus, and we're hoping to get your help this time!

We're calling this effort Server Bug Zapping. The schedule and plans are detailed here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ServerLucidBugZapping

http://blog.dustinkirkland.com/2010/02/server-bug-zapping-call-for.html

==== Laura Czajkowski: Ubuntu Women has a new IRC Channel ====

Since UDS Lucid we’ve been working on some changes as a team, most know about the Ubuntu team leader, but also a big change was the decision to have a LOGGED CHANNEL. These came about from discussions and meetings discussing the IRC purpose, as again the team is more than IRC.

Many many conversations were happening on IRC and not on mailing list of indeed the forums.  If you weren’t on IRC you missed the information or indeed the lengthy and interesting discussions taking place.  The idea to create a logged channel means if you don’t IRC, not on IRC at the time, and perhaps you don’t run a screen session you don’t lose out on these conversations and discussions, you can catch up and read the logs like many other teams.

We now have two channels and I’d like to point out to folks to perhaps join and update their autojoin

If anyone has any questions pop onto IRC and chat to us there.

==== A preview of Ubuntu 10.04 ====

Kenny Johnson of the PC Report acknowledges that Ubuntu 10.04 (Lucid Lynx) is only in the Alpha stage of testing at this moment. It doesn’t look extremely different from the current version of Ubuntu but there are a few noticeable differences. Johnson decided to dig a little to find out what has been changed. The most notable differences to me are the games (or lack thereof) and a video editing software called Pi``Ti``Vi. The games that come with Ubuntu 10.04 are Aisle``Riot Solitaire, gbrainy, Mahjongg, Mines, Quadrapassel, and Sudoku. The video editor known as Pi``Ti``Vi looks similar to Windows Movie Maker in Johnson's opinion. Ubuntu Software Center has been upgraded, and when you click on the Games category the screen gets split and you can chose from a sub-category or scroll through the entire list of games. These are just the first few things Johnson discovered. Follow the link for more information.

==== An Update On The Boot & Power Performance In Ubuntu 10.04 ====

Phoronix's Michael Larabel recalls that in December he wrote that Ubuntu 10.04 already shortened the boot time, which has been a great focus amongst Canonical and Ubuntu developers as they strive for a ten second boot. A lot has changed since that article was published last year, including the introduction of Plymouth and many kernel mode-setting improvements along with the introduction of Nouveau for NVIDIA KMS support. Larabel has ran a new boot performance comparison on two laptops and a netbook to see how the boot times are looking with Ubuntu 10.04 LTS when compared to Ubuntu 9.10. He also looked at how the power consumption has changed in the Lucid Lynx for these mobile devices. Ubuntu 10.04 LTS "Lucid Lynx" is certainly on track to booting much faster than its predecessor, which will certainly please many mobile users particularly those with netbook computers. While it's not been an active area of interest for Ubuntu developers, Ubuntu 10.04 LTS doesn't appear to be any more power efficient than Ubuntu 9.10 besides with some notebooks now dimming to a darker state by default when running on battery power.

==== Ubuntu 10.04 to Include Built-In Music Store ====

Kevin Purdy of Lifehacker notes that looking to further its mission of making your software, and your media, free of restrictions, Ubuntu is bundling an Ubuntu One Music Store into 10.04, the next release of the Linux operating system due out in April. The store uses 7Digital as its provider, likely due to its greater international availability than Amazon's own offering, and looks to be integrated into the Rhythmbox music player. The Ubuntu One name implies a likely connection with the cloud-based file syncing service, and a blogger who came across a preview interface [1] says each track purchased can be downloaded 3 times on different computers.

==== Ubuntu goin' gray, like the Mac OS way? ====

Tech Source's Jun Auza reports that a source from inside the Ubuntu team has informed a blogger that there will be an important announcement coming from Canonical regarding a possible rebranding of Ubuntu. A lot of enthusiasts are quick to speculate that the changes will be all about the color schemes used by Ubuntu and that it may go from brown to gray. Evidence pointing to an Ubuntu makeover is this Ubuntu Single Sign On page where the logo being used is color gray and not the usual brown. There’s also this statement made by Shuttleworth from a recent interview in which he said: "We'll have some new styling which is going to be the starting point of another five year view. We've been Human for the last five years and now we're going to be light oriented." If indeed Ubuntu turns to gray or light oriented as they call it, how will the users react?

==== Analysis: Ubuntu 10.04 Keeping Pace, Or More, With Windows? ====

Edward F. Moltzen, writing for Channel``Web, has reviewed Ubuntu 10.04 "Lucid Lynx" Alpha 3 and feels that it compares well to Windows 7 in boot speed: 15.2 seconds for Lucid Lynx compared to 30 seconds for Windows 7 on the same machine.  He also noted that it includes other software in it's installation.  NVidia is getting solid support, and Gwibber, a social networking application that aggregates services including Flickr, Twitter and Facebook is now included.  He also tried putting Windows 7 inside a Virtual Machine (VM) in Lucid Lynx, and putting Lucid Lynx inside a VM in Windows 7, and was successful both ways.  In his words, "Folks, this is the real deal."

==== Customizing the Ubuntu Application Stack Before Installation ====
Christopher Tozzi, workswithU, discusses the pros and cons of allowing users to pick and choose what applications users want on their computers when installing Ubuntu on a new system.  In this article Tozzi discusses nhandler's brainstorm idea that proposes just that.  Tozzi points out that the implementation of this idea may save advance users time in customizing their systems after a new install, but may as d0od points out on OMG!Ubuntu, confuse new or "non-geek" users. Tozzi himself agrees that though the idea has some limitations it also has merit, and he would like to see Ubiquity follow suit.

==== EFL brings Ubuntu Netbook Remix to ARM ====

Gustavo Sverzut Barbieri, Enlightenment news, points to Jamie Bennett's (Canonical, Mobile Team) about the new user interface (UI) for the ARM based Ubuntu devices. Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL) enabled rich graphical user interfaces even on non-3D-accelerated ARM devices and this is what the UNR ARM devices will use. Barbieri gives some history on EFL in this article as well as pointing out that the Enlightenment team boasts pride over in this inclusion stating, "Another of the great things about this launcher, as opposed to the 3D launcher shipped with Karmic, is that it's extremely theme-able. The Enlightenment team is proud its products are being used more and more on embedded systems, be they e-book readers, phones, or TV's; x86, ARM, or MIPS; accelerated or non-accelerated hardware."

==== Ubuntu Linux Now Available to Fed Customers on GSA Advantage ====

David Coursey, PCWorld, points out that Ubuntu is now the third Linux operating system approved by the General Services Administration (GSA) for use by federal purchasers.  Red hat and Novell are already available through the GSA advantage purchasing program.  "This gives government purchasers the option of using Canonical's Ubuntu as well as its Landscape systems management and monitoring tool," said Cole Crawford, CTO of Autonomic Resources, an IT and service integration company approved to offer the products to federal customers.  Ubuntu is currently the most popular operating system base for developers building cloud-based computing solutions, Crawford said. The open source operating system is already used in some government agencies, including NASA, but has not been widely available as it lacked GSA schedule pricing and support."
The value to the federal government or to Canonical with Ubuntu and the Landscape services being added to the GSA schedule is unknown at this time, but to find out more follow the link.
