''' Bionic Beaver ''' <nowiki>[[File:bionicbeaver.png]]</nowiki>

== Introduction ==

''' Say hello to Bionic Beaver. ''' 

''' Artful Aardvark is behind us and Bionic Beaver is now chomping away , building new clouds and infrastructure. Bionic will be busy with getting gnome3 and wayland just right and there will be lots of fun with unity7 still in the repos. Also the other great flavors like Xubuntu, MATE Lubuntu and Kubuntu plus many more and don't forget to have fun! '''

=== New Beta Testers Warnings ===

''' Bionic Beaver is the codename for the new development cycle. If you are a new Beta tester and want to upgrade your repositories to the new development cycle then you must be advised that there are certain risks of breakage that could take place on your system(s). it is always advised that you have an extra system (hardware) or an extra harddrive to experiment with. If you are not familiar with experimenting with computer hardware or software then  U+1 is not the forum for you, however, if you are willing to be on the cutting edge of Ubuntu release and understand that  there could be breakage and want to contribute  then the Ubuntu community welcomes you and your valued contributions. '''

=== Some sudo Command Definitions ===
'''sudo''' basically means  '''superusers-do'''. It is the basic command that gives access to administrative files that may need root authentication. There is  a large database on '''sudo''' and '''sudoers''' definitions and uses in the following links. <nowiki>[[http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/man8/sudo.8.html|SudoUbuntuManuals]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/maverick/man5/sudoers.5.html|SudoersUbuntuManual]]</nowiki>

<nowiki>[[File:sudocodegrab1.png|Sudo code quick grabber is an online index that can be used as a tool to copy and paste sudo code recovery commands to the GNOME terminal. The list of recovery codes and other command operations are voluminous, therefore the Sudo Quickgrabber only covers a few very basic commands for those who are testing development releases or alpha/beta releases of Ubuntu software. This particular tool is under development and will be updated as promptly as possible.]]</nowiki>

<nowiki>[[File:line.png]]</nowiki>

Here are some common codes of interest to help with Artful Ardvark recovery in the event of a crash.

How to find your sources.list - this list is used to set repositories and can be done manually. It is also informative to have on hand if you decide to do a transitional upgrade from Oneiric Ocelot to Precise Pangolin or upcoming Trusty Tahr, Utopic Unicorn, Vivid Vervet to Wily Werewolf and WW to Xenial Xerus to Yakkety Yak to Zesty Zapus to Artful Aardvark.

<nowiki>[[File:line.png]]</nowiki>

<nowiki>[[File:hover1bak.png|When you use this command in the terminal it will prompt you for your root password. Enter the password and the text editor, Gedit, will read the sources.list file. This file is convenient to have on hand in case there is a problem ppa within the .list and better helps the forum members at ubuntuforums to help analyze and solve the problem.]]</nowiki> '''gksu gedit /etc/apt/sources.list'''

<nowiki>[[File:line.png]]</nowiki>

Here is a list of commonly used Ubuntu/Linux terminal Codes (not necessarily in order and open to interpretation) of AA Crash Recovery Codes -To be updated:

<nowiki>[[File:line.png|hover1bak.png]]</nowiki>

<nowiki>[[File:hover1bak.png|1. This command is used to auto edit the sources.list file on an install of Saucy Salamander , Raring Ringtail , Utopic Unicorn or Vivid Vervet and could be considered as a first step to converting to Wily Werewolf to Xenial Xerus to Yakkety Yak to Zesty Zapus. However this and other commands may be moot after Alpha .iso are released. You can still play it safe and test the kernels but breakage may occur nonetheless.Current cycle is 17.10 Artful Aardvark]]</nowiki> '''sudo sed -i 's/zesty/artful/g' /etc/apt/sources.list'''

<nowiki>[[File:hover1bak.png|2. This command will update your repositories to ZZ.]]</nowiki> '''sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade'''

<nowiki>[[File:hover1bak.png|3.This command is inclusive in #2. but is always good to run after removing or purging unwanted or residual programs.]]</nowiki> '''sudo apt-get update'''

<nowiki>[[File:hover1bak.png|4.This command is also included in #2. and upgrades any new files that are set in the repositories.]]</nowiki> '''sudo apt-get upgrade'''

<nowiki>[[File:hover1bak.png|4.(a)Update-manager is a fairly important component of the Ubuntu distribution. As we are supposed to be testing during the development phase, this application would be helped by testing and bug reporting as well.You can always make a judgement call as to whether the changes proposed by update-manager seem safe or not. If in doubt I think the best way to proceed is with aptitude. This alleviates the concern when packages/dependencies may not be fully synced in the repos. They will be held back until dependencies are satisfied.]]</nowiki> '''aptitude update && aptitude  safe-upgrade'''

<nowiki>[[File:hover1bak.png|5.This command is an essential command if you are a elementary beta tester as it will upgrade the GRUB bootloader after changes to the system using other commands, are made (like upgrading a kernel). If you have tried to carry out a procedure and wonder why it had not taken effect on the next boot, it is likely that you did not sudo update-grub.]]</nowiki> '''sudo update-grub'''

<nowiki>[[File:hover1bak.png|6.This command will give you simple information about your system, most commonly used to discover your video adapter.]]</nowiki> '''lspci'''

<nowiki>[[File:hover1bak.png|7.This command will display more detailed information about your systems' hardware and some of the drivers being used by it.]]</nowiki> '''lshw'''

<nowiki>[[File:hover1bak.png|8.This command will display version information of the kernel you are using.]]</nowiki> '''uname -a'''

<nowiki>[[File:hover1bak.png|9.This command will tell you what Version of Ubuntu you are using. It will help validate and document that the prior commands have worked properly.]]</nowiki> '''lsb_release -a'''

<nowiki>[[File:hover1bak.png|10.This command will continue to install packages that may have been broken during download or if your download unexpectedly terminated or if you have had a power-failure.]]</nowiki> '''sudo dpkg -i --configure -a'''

<nowiki>[[File:hover1bak.png|11.These two commands can be used separately if you are at the terminal prompt from startup. You can get to the terminal (if you have no desktop) by pressing the keys <Crtl+Alt+F1> It makes booting and restarting quicker and more efficient than if you were in a desktop shell.]]</nowiki> '''sudo reboot'''
'''sudo poweroff'''

<nowiki>[[File:hover1bak.png|12.One that I have found helpful for fixing broken packages is .]]</nowiki> '''sudo apt-get -f install'''

<nowiki>[[File:hover1bak.png|13.Will install any packages necessary to fix the broken package if they are available . If some necessary packages are not available you can use this to remove the broken one .]]</nowiki> '''sudo apt-get -f remove'''

<nowiki>[[File:hover1bak.png|14.Just tried installing Precise for the first time today, using Alpha 1. I have an nvidia gs7600 card.Installation went fine but on reboot the system repeatedly hung without booting to the Desktop. The 'nomodeset' option did not help.Updating the packages from the recovery mode terminal didn't work either, nor did trying to start lightdm after a terminal log in.What finally allowed booting to the Desktop was removing all nvidia packages and then reinstalling nvidia-current (which also installed nvidia-settings).]]</nowiki> '''sudo apt-get purge nvidia*, sudo apt-get install nvidia-current'''

<nowiki>[[File:hover1bak.png|15.Sometimes there have been problems in the past with the lightdm and unity greeter. The solution has been to start GDM ,Gnome Desktop Manager, when certain video&graphic startup problems persist on a new install. First, it is always good to stop lightdm.]]</nowiki> '''sudo service lightdm stop'''

<nowiki>[[File:hover1bak.png|16.To start the Gnome Desktop Manager enter the following commands.]]</nowiki> '''sudo service gdm start'''

=== Todo ===
Ideas:
* We should use MoinMoin Syntax Parsers (http://moinmo.in/HelpOnParsers) where commands/code are presented. Parsers ensure code/commands are not converted to smileys and other MoinMoin stuff, therefore presented without errors.
* We had some amazing threads, specially since the OO cycle, which maybe we could use here;
* The stickies at Ubuntu+1 have some information that can probably be summarized / simplified here - investigate;
* Add a "What is a development cycle" section: How Ubuntu is developed, by who, where, how, when and where it is released (Alphas, Betas, RCs, etc), who tests it, how it is tested, where bugs are reported, how to report bugs properly, who manages bugs reports, etc. A basic vision of how Ubuntu development works."
* Log files: A lot of people don't know they exist, where they are stored, the type of information available in each log file, how to open them, how to search them easily for valuable information. '''EDIT:'''I'll contribute to this portion - I already have something written, as well as log searching scripts posted at Ubuntu+1 threads (posted by Effenberg0x0)
