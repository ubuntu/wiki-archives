==== Oli Warner: Humble Indie Bundle is the single greatest thing to happen to Linux in years ====

Humble Bundle makes a large amount of money while giving to charities and developers, and aids in bringing high-quality games to Linux. He shares that the "first Bundle raised over a million dollars and they kept doing them. The fifth major Bundle (there have been smaller intermediate ones as well) just finished with over five million dollars."

=== In The Press ===

==== Linux gaming on the rise: EA arrives on Ubuntu and Valve plans Steam port ====

Arstechnica's Ryan Paul surveys the current landscape of Linux gaming. Historically, "the relatively small number of total users and the lack of an effective distribution channel" prevented Linux from becoming an attractive platform for game developers. That has changed, with Canonical offering commercial games through its Software Center, and various game publishers showing interest. Even Valve, with its Steam engine, has plans for Linux now.

Moreover, the top three vote-getters in a community poll will also qualify for an N9."

And with the inevitable flood of high-resolution laptop and desktop screens on the way it’s a discussion that is best had sooner rather than later.”
