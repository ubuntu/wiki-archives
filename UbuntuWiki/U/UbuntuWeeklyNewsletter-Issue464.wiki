==== Paul White: Some thoughts about Xenial development, an annoying bug and Yakkety Yak ====

Paul White blogs abouts his stepping back and becoming a "floating contributor." He is impressed by the hard work and enthusiasm that goes into each Ubuntu release, while noting the minor bugs that do occasionally get into releases such as #1521302 which affects 'gnome-terminal' and will be fixed by 16.04.1. Paul suggests using terminator if you are bothered by the bug in the meantime. Finally, he gives his thoughts on “Yakkety Yak.”

http://blog.pcw.me.uk/2016/04/some-thoughts-about-xenial-development.html

==== Stéphane Graber: LXD 2.0: Live migration [9/12] ====

Stéphane Graber continues the series (this is the 9th of 12) about LXD 2.0. This is on container checkpoint and restore which remains experimental at this time. To have access to this container live migration, Stéphane lists the requirements (16.04 has them all) and apt command to install. Then by using example he provides examples of it, its limitations, and requests that if you discover bugs then please fill out a Launchpad bug report.

https://www.stgraber.org/2016/04/25/lxd-2-0-live-migration-912/

==== Matthias Klumpp: A GNOME Software Hackfest report ====

Matthias tells us about the recent GNOME hackfest in London. Starting off as travel log, it moves into shout-outs to various people he hadn't seen in awhile then to new people, including folks from Endless “who build their low-budget computer for developing/emerging countries on top of GNOME and Linux technologies.” Matthias was surprised to see what Endless had done too, writing that the “incarnation of GNOME Software used by endless looks pretty different from what the normal GNOME user sees”. His post touches on many different topics (Xdg``App, sandboxing, App``Stream, etc) ending in a big thank you to the Ubuntu Community Fund for sponsoring him to be there.

http://blog.tenstral.net/2016/04/gnome-software-hackfest-report.html

==== Canonical Design Team: Ubuntu orange update ====

A short blog by Jamie Young to document the new color palette update in the SDK; the new orange for screen use is E95420.

http://design.canonical.com/2016/04/ubuntu-orange-update/

==== Forums Council: Forum Staff Additions ====

Documenting the addition of new Forum Moderators accepted as part of the Staff team. The Ubuntu Forums Council congratulates Duck``Hook, jeremy31, kc1di, MAFoElffen, nerdtron, oldrocker99, vasa1, wgarcia & runrickus for becoming Forum Moderators.

https://ubuntuforumsorg.wordpress.com/2016/04/26/forum-staff-additions-2/

==== Zygmunt Krynicki: Anatomy of a snappy interface ====

Zygmunt Krynicki writes another blog post (third) in a series teaching us about making Snappy interfaces. Zygmunt uses code fragments to explain what's needed to create an interface. He writes also that if you want to create the interface, you'll have to wait for the next post.

http://www.zygoon.pl/2016/04/anatomy-of-snappy-interface.html

==== Nekhelesh Ramananthan: uNav 0.59 "Beauty and the Beast" is OUT! ====

The uNav team, through Nekhelesh Ramananthan, is proud to announce the release of iNav 0.59.  He shares that uNav is a navigation app, and the hope of this release is turning the "beast" of power within uNav into a “beauty” in its use.

http://nik90.com/unav-0-59-beauty-and-the-beast-2/

==== Simon Quigley: Contributing to Ubuntu - 2 - Ubuntu Quality ====

Simon Quigley, having done a couple of forms of QA for the Ubuntu project, tells us how we'd go about it. Using annotated screen dumps with explanation, Simon walks us through some of how we'd go about testing a Lubuntu 16.10 daily build, saving bandwidth by using zsync, creating or selecting a test case, and logging bugs via Launchpad. Links are provided for further explanation, but and he asserts that if you're thinking you'd like contribute to Ubuntu via testing, this could be a starting point.

==== Canonical Design Team: Wallpaper design for Xenial Xerus 16.04 ====

Grazina Borosko writes about how the default wallpaper for Xenial Xerus 16.04 was designed using the Suru visual language. Grazina starts by showing default wallpapers of 14.10 through 15.10, shares the Origami animal made in the image of Xerus and notes that the final resulting default wallpaper of Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial Xerus is inspired by the Origami folds.

==== Sam Hewitt: Extending the Ubuntu Icon Spec. ====

Sam Hewitt talks about his extension to the Ubuntu Icon specification, saying, “When I started designing app icons for folks, I (too) felt the official specification was lacking detailed instructions and explanations for the Suru design –not to mention it's woefully out of date– which isn't much help. My only recourse was to follow updates to the official icons themselves and to dissect the icons to determine the elements and visual principles that make up the Suru style and updates to it.” He links to his extension to the guide.

http://samuelhewitt.com/blog/2016-04-29-extending-ubuntu-icon-design-spec

==== Michael Terry: In-App Purchases Available in the Ubuntu Store ====

Michael Terry points out the new ability to have in-app purchases in Ubuntu Touch apps. He points out, “Besides allowing someone to write the next Candy Crush, this also means that app authors can stop providing separate ‘donation’ versions of their app. Which means less busywork for authors, reviews are all on the same app, and less confusion for users.“

=== Other Community News ===

==== Wolfram Research releases Data Drop Logging app for Ubuntu Phone ====

David Pitkin announces that in collaboration with Wolfram Research, Canonical has released the “first app collaboration with cloud connect functionality for Ubuntu developers and users,” Wolfram Data Drop™ Logging. He writes: “The application turns an Ubuntu phone into a powerful cloud-connected sensor collection device. It has the ability to send location, acceleration and rotation data directly to a Wolfram Cloud Databin where you can then interact and use your own data just like any other Wolfram data source.” The post concludes by including the community in their celebration of this new app, asking users to tweet the most original findings from their collected sensor data using the #Ubuntu``Wolfram hash tag.
