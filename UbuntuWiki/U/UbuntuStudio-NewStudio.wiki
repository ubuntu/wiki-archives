__TOC__

This page is for the outlining of Ubuntu Studio's new direction.

==== Ideas: ====
* PPA for tested and trusted pkgs. Kernels, new apps ect. All with the intention of getting anything we can eventually into Ubuntu.

* *hopefully by 12.10 or so, we will not need a custom kernel anymore

* No installable releases. (/Possibly/ spinning an add-on disk (i think Edubuntu does this) or LTS only releases.)

* We would become an add-on and desktop agnostic.

* Theming can be done to support KDE and XFCE.

* Continue development of "Controls" to allow users to set things easily.

* Clean up our LP pages. As changes happen to LP so do our pages. Things feel/look very convoluted and need love.

==== Target Audience ====
in the IRC, we have discussed the target audience, and have somewhat decided that the new user (new to audio/video/graphics, and new to linux) is our target. there are no other multimedia distros currently catering to those users
