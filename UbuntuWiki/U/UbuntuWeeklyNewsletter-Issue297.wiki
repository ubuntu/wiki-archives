==== Daniel Holbach: What’s going on with the Nexus 7? ====

Daniel Holbach gives us an update about Nexus 7 and Ubuntu 13.04 (Raring Ringtale):

* A new onboard pre-release made it into 13.04 which fixes many bugs and makes the on-screen keyboard much easier to use.
* The new Unity stack is included in 13.04 and is now automatically tested after commits and auto-released as part of a 13.04 build.
* The new images use oem-config to present the installer window where users can specify a username, a wireless network, and other bits.

Holbach informs us it is now possible to put Ubuntu 13.04 on the Nexus 7 without any additional PPAs or reflashing. Holbach also writes about further improvements to memory usage and recommends Alex Chiang’s articles, which can be found at the following links:

==== Timo Jyrinki: Compiz fullscreen unredirection - update ====

Timo Jyrinki brings an update about Compiz’s "unredirection by default" feature for full-screen applications:

* The option is Composite -> Undirect Match (unredirect_match) available in the Compiz``Config Settings Manager (ccsm).
* change the unredirect_match option to be just '(any)' for enabling video playback on older/slower integrated graphics devices, which are usually just barely able to play HD videos with risk of tearing some drivers and apps
* And many others...
