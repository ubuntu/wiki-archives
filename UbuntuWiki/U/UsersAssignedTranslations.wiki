__TOC__

This is a page explaining this blueprint: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/launchpad/+spec/users-assigned-translations

See the blueprint page for summary. Whis wiki page elaborates on the details.

* '''Goal: give a translator overview of translations he's interested in'''
* The overview should be located at https://translations.launchpad.net/~username/+bookmarks (and linked from the menu which currently contains Overview, Translations licensing, Import queue)
* It should contain a table like this one https://translations.launchpad.net/ubuntu/jaunty/+lang/sk but containing only bookmarked projects
* The translator should be able to select (bookmars) projects he wants to see
* There should be a "Bookmark this translation" link at a project's translation page
* If there's a system in LP where a translator has been assigned a translation, this should show up automatically, too
* For translations which are a part of Ubuntu consider showing status of translation in all supported Ubuntu releases (e.g. currently Hardy, Intrepid, Jaunty)
