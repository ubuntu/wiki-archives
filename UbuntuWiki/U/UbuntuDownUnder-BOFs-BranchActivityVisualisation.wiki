=== Summary ===

People interested in contributing to, packaging, or administering details of a product need to decide which branch or branches of that product to work on. To do this, they need to compare the relative activity of those branches. The product page will show this as a table of branches, with bars for merges in, merges out, and differences from the mainline, and text for other data.
