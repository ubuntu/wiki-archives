(12:04:06 PM) johnc4510: me as you probably know  :)

(12:04:27 PM) Joe_CoT: yeah

(12:05:09 PM) Joe_CoT: Zelut, Vorian, boredandblogging,nixternal, bordy_away, 

atoponce,FunnyLookingHat,lamalex_,peanutb ?

(12:05:28 PM) pak33m: well, i guess that iwould like to intro myself because ive volunterred myself as meetinf 
master, as least this is what Zelut dubbed me 

(12:05:50 PM) Joe_CoT: hello

(12:06:01 PM) pak33m: ...this was during the BoF us teams meeting at ubuntu live

(12:06:28 PM) Joe_CoT: ah. yay for ppl who can fly to oregon and pay for conferences :)

(12:06:30 PM) pak33m: anyway im jimmy and i am withthe florida team

(12:06:45 PM) pak33m: i actualy won a free pass

(12:06:54 PM) johnc4510: excellent

(12:06:57 PM) Joe_CoT: ah. how'd ya manage that?

(12:07:15 PM) pak33m: i just wrote a story to corey burger on planetubuntu

(12:08:05 PM) johnc4510: nice to meet ya

(12:08:12 PM) pak33m: i managed to make a cross with jean-paul sartre and the spirit of ubuntu

(12:08:18 PM) pak33m: thanks

(12:08:27 PM) pak33m: lets start the meeting then

(12:09:22 PM) pak33m: ...if i start to sound real neurotic let me know

(12:09:26 PM) pak33m: of course the meeting agnda can be found here https://wiki.ubuntu.com/USTeams/IRC

(12:09:45 PM) Joe_CoT: ok.

(12:10:12 PM) pak33m: the first item is How to recruit new LoCo conacts

(12:10:27 PM) pak33m: ideas?

(12:10:34 PM) Joe_CoT: As far as recruiting goes, one of things I've been doing is try to lure in states that 
currently don't have a team. I've been emailing with people from the University of Delaware LUG to get people 
interested there.

(12:10:48 PM) johnc4510: nice

(12:11:03 PM) Joe_CoT: If you're lucky, just telling interested people in another state about LoCo teams is enough 

to get it to take off.

(12:11:20 PM) Joe_CoT: As far as recruiting in /your/ state, no idea. If you figure it out, let me know :)

(12:11:51 PM) johnc4510: I work on the Ubuntu Weekly news and can include a piece for recuiting on a weekly basis

(12:13:01 PM) Joe_CoT: Local LUGS are a good place to start.

(12:13:34 PM) johnc4510: i also try to inform people in chat channels I attend to join a loco or start one

(12:13:44 PM) Joe_CoT: Honestly, in my opinion, High Schools and Colleges are probably the best recruiting grounds. 
They simply have much more time to do this stuff. I'll be testing that theory out in September

(12:13:46 PM) johnc4510: LUGS are one of the best places to start

(12:13:59 PM) pak33m: maybe we could have a header for the Loco teams forums annoucing that thee are states that 
need contacts & recruitement so that anybody an see it when they go to the ubuntuforums

(12:14:43 PM) pak33m: on the florida team we have recentlyl discussed forming a recruitment team 

(12:14:58 PM) johnc4510: good idea on forum header

(12:15:19 PM) Joe_CoT: maybe. I don't know how well it would sell.

(12:15:42 PM) Joe_CoT: we do have ubuntu-us.org , which should (theoretically) get people connected with LoCo teams

(12:15:59 PM) johnc4510: agreed

(12:16:24 PM) Joe_CoT: so if you're talking to interested people /not/ from your state, send them there :)

(12:16:33 PM) johnc4510: yes

(12:16:53 PM) johnc4510: the recent map was good

(12:17:02 PM) claydoh left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).

(12:17:16 PM) Joe_CoT: yeah, that's about all I've got on recruiting. Anyone else?

(12:17:22 PM) pak33m: my idea about the header was to put it here http://ubuntuforums.org/ just under or above 
Ubuntu LoCo Team Forums

(12:18:05 PM) claydoh [n=claydoh@66-252-54-247.dyn-adsl.midmaine.net] entered the room.

(12:18:27 PM) johnc4510: i'm not sure that will work   but it will here: http://ubuntuforums.org/
forumdisplay.php?f=183

(12:18:56 PM) Joe_CoT: if people are looking there, they're in a LoCo team already

(12:19:06 PM) Joe_CoT: the only place that would help is on the main page

(12:19:06 PM) pak33m: johnc: yeah thats beter

(12:19:20 PM) johnc4510: Joe_CoT: can it go on the main page

(12:19:22 PM) johnc4510: ?

(12:19:25 PM) pak33m: but yeah joe_c that s true

(12:20:02 PM) Joe_CoT: johnc4510: it's certainly possible, i don't know if we could get it done

(12:20:22 PM) johnc4510: who would we have to consult about that

(12:20:22 PM) pak33m: this way anybody from any sates might come across the header & be interested when accessing 
the forum

(12:20:41 PM) pak33m: and thus sign up

(12:21:47 PM) pak33m: ok, looks like we have the following recruiting ideas:

(12:21:50 PM) Joe_CoT: probably someone in #ubuntuforums. probably the guy that runs the thing (is it ubuntu-demon 
or ubuntu-geek? i never remember)

(12:22:07 PM) johnc4510: maybe ubuntugeek

(12:22:16 PM) pak33m: Lugs, forum header, schools & weekly newsletter...did i forget anything else?

(12:22:25 PM) johnc4510: vorian has referred me to him before

(12:22:51 PM) johnc4510: looks like all

(12:23:39 PM) johnc4510: it seems to me we especially need focus on states with no teams  newsletter and forum header will be good for those

(12:23:53 PM) pak33m: johnc: yes

(12:23:54 PM) Joe_CoT: yeah

(12:24:21 PM) pak33m: how do we do that with  lugs & schools...ideas?

(12:24:49 PM) pak33m: in other states that is?

(12:25:11 PM) johnc4510: not sure

(12:25:21 PM) Joe_CoT: with LUGs (at least in my state) i've been doing presentations on Ubuntu and LoCo teams. 
That would probably work just as well with LUGs in other states

(12:25:22 PM) pak33m: i know that i see career recruiting emails in my locall lug mailing lists...maybe something 
like that 

(12:25:33 PM) Joe_CoT: just email them.

(12:25:38 PM) pak33m: yeah

(12:25:39 PM) Joe_CoT: see where it goes from there

(12:26:03 PM) pak33m: you wouldnt get any response from my local lugs beacse its full of older, unix guys

(12:26:08 PM) johnc4510: is there a national lug org

(12:26:46 PM) johnc4510: if so we might be able to appeal to them to help us recruit

(12:26:58 PM) johnc4510: in their newsletters

(12:27:28 PM) johnc4510: i would be glad to look into that  if you want

(12:27:59 PM) pak33m: on the florida team wiki i posted some lugs in our state https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FloridaTeam/
NewUser...maybe we could find all or some or most lugs in each state that is missing a team

(12:28:22 PM) pak33m: ...the list near the bottom of the link

(12:28:54 PM) johnc4510: we could

(12:29:46 PM) Joe_CoT: wow, you guys have a lot of LUGs

(12:29:50 PM) Joe_CoT: new jersey has I think 3

(12:29:52 PM) pak33m: we could make a sticky in the absolute beginners form with an annoucement looking for ppl

(12:29:55 PM) Joe_CoT: and delaware has 1

(12:30:09 PM) johnc4510: AZ about 3

(12:30:17 PM) johnc4510: not very active either

(12:30:22 PM) pak33m: i did a fair amount of research into it

(12:30:48 PM) johnc4510: we still need about 25 teams    is that right

(12:30:59 PM) johnc4510: more or less

(12:31:23 PM) Joe_CoT: 19 to my count

(12:31:31 PM) pak33m: curent map is here https://wiki.ubuntu.com/USTeams/TeamList/

(12:31:54 PM) Joe_CoT: keep in mind, though, some of our "new" teams are a wiki page that say "hey, we're in this 
state and like ubuntu! let me know if you wanna do anything"

(12:32:10 PM) johnc4510: k , so if we are going to research 19 states for lugs   we are going to have to divid it 
up somehow

(12:32:11 PM) pak33m: i know im one of those

(12:32:14 PM) johnc4510: true

(12:32:38 PM) Joe_CoT: some are "work in progress (last updated in February)"

(12:32:45 PM) johnc4510: ah

(12:33:01 PM) Joe_CoT: so yeah, we need to work on those too. Many of the new teams aren't going anywhere either

(12:33:15 PM) pak33m: my question is how can there be so may ppl involved in ubuntu and so few "biggger" sates 
without teams?

(12:33:23 PM) bordy_away is now known as bordy

(12:33:34 PM) johnc4510: hi bordy

(12:33:43 PM) bordy: pak331: its a pain starting up a team.. or at least it seems it from the outside, neh?

(12:33:57 PM) johnc4510: it's a lot of work for sure

(12:34:05 PM) Joe_CoT: because the people involved are technical guys. They don't want to be making phone calls, 
sending 10 emails a night, and putting up flyers.

(12:34:24 PM) johnc4510: yes

(12:34:27 PM) Joe_CoT: the ground work is a complete pain, but it needs to get done

(12:34:34 PM) johnc4510: hard to get participation

(12:35:06 PM) Joe_CoT: yep. i don't know if we'll be having a SFD event this year. I wanted to get multiple across 
the state, we /may/ get one

(12:35:11 PM) bordy: But the glory of ubuntu is that it draw all kinds... like me, I am no where near a tech guy. 
Which is, i think, why I was decently suited to start Florida. lol. Then pak came along and made it easier

(12:36:14 PM) pak33m: thats good enough reason to (non-tech ppl) to put an annoucement in the absolute beginners 
forum as well

(12:36:26 PM) Joe_CoT: bordy: yep, and it's the non-technical people we really need. The LUG guys come out in 
droves for install-fest, but they don't help promote it

(12:36:28 PM) johnc4510: i'm the same as bordy   just a user   we organize well though

(12:36:29 PM) pak33m: at least to draw some interest

(12:37:20 PM) pak33m: so, now on to how to recruit in schools...ideas?

(12:38:20 PM) johnc4510: well, on the AZ team we are setting up demos at the colleges

(12:38:34 PM) Joe_CoT: a lan party is probably the best recruiting tool for schools. Appeal to school computing 
clubs

(12:38:41 PM) johnc4510: when they have fairs   and   orientation days

(12:38:48 PM) johnc4510: yes

(12:38:50 PM) pak33m: like s tand or in a computer class?

(12:38:53 PM) johnc4510: that's good

(12:39:19 PM) johnc4510: all the college have computer clubs of some kind

(12:39:40 PM) nixternal: YO!

(12:39:44 PM) johnc4510: AZ has a lot of college people on team   that has helped

(12:39:48 PM) johnc4510: nixternal: hi

(12:39:52 PM) pak33m: how bout giving a presentation in compter classes...i did at my tech school & ppl were 
excited to hear about ubuntu

(12:40:08 PM) johnc4510: it's a possiblity

(12:40:18 PM) pak33m: ...i got a few responses

(12:40:23 PM) johnc4510: if you can find and convience a prof

(12:41:02 PM) pak33m: i did & he is a big m$ proponent...he was impressed bu shipit

(12:41:24 PM) etank [n=etank@ubuntu/member/etank] entered the room.

(12:41:28 PM) pak33m: ...he ordered his cds straight away

(12:41:31 PM) Joe_CoT: hi etank

(12:41:31 PM) johnc4510: etank: greetings

(12:41:45 PM) johnc4510: pak331: nice

(12:41:50 PM) pak33m: any other ideas for recruiting at schools?

(12:42:10 PM) etank: hi everyone

(12:42:14 PM) johnc4510: :)

(12:42:17 PM) pak33m: hi eank

(12:42:23 PM) bordy: pak331: whys your nick weird today?

(12:42:27 PM) bordy: etank: yo yo yo

(12:42:33 PM) pak33m: im weird

(12:43:27 PM) pak33m: if no other ideas...

(12:43:46 PM) Joe_CoT: Zelut: stop sending us emails and join the meeting :P

(12:44:12 PM) pak33m: ok, now on to weekly newsleter...

(12:44:13 PM) johnc4510: :)

(12:44:19 PM) etank: i forgot that there is a meeting today :(

(12:44:25 PM) etank: did i miss everything?

(12:44:47 PM) pak33m: etank: were working through the agenda

(12:44:54 PM) etank: cool

(12:44:55 PM) bordy: etank: this is an actual meeting?! I thought the room was just somehow more productive than 
usual!

(12:44:57 PM) johnc4510: just been discussing recuitment

(12:45:13 PM) johnc4510: bordy: np join in

(12:45:19 PM) johnc4510: HEE HEE

(12:45:36 PM) pak33m: etank: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/USTeams/IRC

(12:45:56 PM) etank: we are talking about recruiting for the existing loco teams or for new ones?

(12:46:16 PM) pak33m: well, for all but ocusing on ew teams

(12:46:25 PM) johnc4510: both but concentrating on new unformed teams

(12:47:00 PM) pak33m: ok, how would we want the newsletter to announce that we ae recruiting...ideas?

(12:47:21 PM) johnc4510: there is a loco section in the UWN

(12:47:23 PM) pak33m: ...and is it johnc that would add it?

(12:47:34 PM) johnc4510: we could use that to recruit

(12:48:09 PM) pak33m: how do we get the newsletter t those who dont read it and/or to those who might be interested 
(or non-tech, etc>)

(12:48:14 PM) johnc4510: a small paragraph on need help starting teams in states with link to map

(12:48:25 PM) johnc4510: good question

(12:48:51 PM) johnc4510: it's not perfect, but UWN does go out to a lot of people

(12:49:21 PM) johnc4510: just trying to add another resource to work wiht

(12:49:23 PM) johnc4510: with

(12:49:25 PM) pak33m: cool

(12:49:40 PM) bordy: and UWN always does show up on digg and whatnot too, not just in email circulation

(12:49:43 PM) bordy: so they do get out there

(12:49:58 PM) johnc4510: true

(12:50:00 PM) johnc4510: ty bordy

(12:50:08 PM) Joe_CoT: digg's a good point. we could try to get LoCo specific stuff up on the digg front page

(12:50:13 PM) pak33m: i think that ubuntuforums is a great place for these annoucemets beacsue everybody intereted 
goes there...and all the time ( i know I do)

(12:50:30 PM) johnc4510: Joe_CoT: that's a good idea

(12:50:47 PM) Joe_CoT: frankly, i'd like to see ubuntu.com have LoCo team stuff on it

(12:51:06 PM) johnc4510: we could also appeal to the planet folks who blog to add a link to teams on their personal 
blog

(12:51:06 PM) Joe_CoT: i don't know if that's doable

(12:51:17 PM) johnc4510: Joe_CoT: yes

(12:51:25 PM) johnc4510: i like that idea

(12:51:38 PM) bordy: joe_cot: doesnt ubuntu.com havea "get involved" section, or "community" section or something 
like that?

(12:51:55 PM) pak33m: how do we get the msg to the non-tech folks too

(12:52:12 PM) johnc4510: the forums is the best way i think

(12:52:19 PM) Joe_CoT: bordy: yes. In that case, I'd like the LoCo team link to link to something more usable

(12:52:30 PM) johnc4510: newbies always hang there trying to learn

(12:52:30 PM) Joe_CoT: right now it links to this: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LoCoTeamList

(12:52:37 PM) etank: pak331: thats what i was wondering too

(12:52:52 PM) pak33m: could we email lugs with the newsletter while annoucing that we are recuiting?

(12:53:43 PM) johnc4510: you mean send them a email UWN and ask for help recruiting?

(12:53:55 PM) johnc4510: or a link to newsletter

(12:53:56 PM) johnc4510: ?

(12:54:28 PM) pak33m: how about notifying canonical partners in states without teams looking for either partnets 
ppl or their customers who se ubuntu or are ubuntu certified

(12:54:47 PM) pak33m: johnc: yes or just tell them that were looking

(12:54:48 PM) etank: good idea

(12:55:08 PM) johnc4510: is there a list of canonical partners?

(12:55:46 PM) pak33m: http://www.ubuntu.com/partners/findapartner

(12:56:30 PM) pak33m: im sure we could get help on this with either jono or conoical

(12:56:41 PM) pak33m: canonical

(12:57:47 PM) johnc4510: should we get the ok from someone before approaching the partners?

(12:58:16 PM) pak33m: should we have a us team recruiting sub-team to make sure all of this (being disussed) is in 
the works or happens?

(12:58:17 PM) Joe_CoT: johnc4510: yes

(12:58:18 PM) johnc4510: it is probably ok, but i wouldn't want to step on any toes

(12:59:08 PM) johnc4510: well, so far we have discussed a lot of ideas   but nothing on implementing them

(12:59:12 PM) bordy: Bringing Jono in to begin with couldnt be a bad idea

(12:59:23 PM) johnc4510: who how when

(12:59:41 PM) Joe_CoT: johnc4510: yeah well. Implementation isn't going to happen in an irc meeting. We need to 
extend it to the mailing list

(12:59:52 PM) johnc4510: true

(01:00:02 PM) pak33m: any volunteers?

(01:00:25 PM) johnc4510: well, of course i am going to take care of UWN

(01:00:26 PM) Joe_CoT: volunteers? who what?

(01:00:57 PM) johnc4510: but i'm willing to help where i can   with the time i have

(01:01:30 PM) pak33m: anybody want to help research what lugs to get the newsletter out to?

(01:01:41 PM) pak33m: or how to get the msg on the forums?

(01:01:50 PM) pak33m: or out to the partners?

(01:02:22 PM) Joe_CoT: pak331: Let's just get a summary of what we want on the mailing list and work from there

(01:02:32 PM) pak33m: ok cool

(01:03:00 PM) johnc4510: Joe_CoT: sounds good

(01:03:09 PM) pak33m: so, what do we want on the mailing list?

(01:03:30 PM) johnc4510: forum header

(01:03:42 PM) johnc4510: state lug's

(01:03:50 PM) johnc4510: UWN

(01:03:54 PM) johnc4510: colleges

(01:04:09 PM) johnc4510: partners

(01:04:34 PM) johnc4510: is that all so far?

(01:04:48 PM) pak33m: yeppers 

(01:04:53 PM) Joe_CoT: getting dugg

(01:05:05 PM) Joe_CoT: changing the link on ubuntu.com to something that's not a 3 page long wiki list?

(01:05:27 PM) johnc4510: hee hee

(01:05:28 PM) johnc4510: :)

(01:05:41 PM) pak33m: how should an annoucement read in the mailing list to al of those places?

(01:06:01 PM) Joe_CoT: to all /those/ places?

(01:06:05 PM) johnc4510: ?

(01:06:15 PM) pak33m: colleges, lugs, etc?

(01:06:38 PM) johnc4510: we need a email to list outlining our proposals and how to achieve them

(01:06:55 PM) pak33m: on the us teams mailing list?

(01:06:57 PM) johnc4510: i think

(01:07:19 PM) Joe_CoT: yeah, we need to talk about it on the us team list. let's use it for something useful for 
once :)

(01:07:26 PM) Joe_CoT: not 10 emails of "is this thing on?"

(01:07:29 PM) johnc4510: agreed

(01:07:41 PM) johnc4510: do some business on mail list

(01:07:54 PM) johnc4510: ideas will come back in i think

(01:08:17 PM) pak33m: agreeed

(01:08:24 PM) johnc4510: if not Joe_CoT can start strong arming members in channel  :)

(01:08:28 PM) etank: agreed

(01:08:56 PM) pak33m: free cds are involed how hard could it be!!

(01:09:00 PM) ***johnc4510 runs and hide from Joe_CoT 

(01:09:20 PM) pak33m: shall we move on then?

(01:09:21 PM) Joe_CoT: johnc4510: lol, strongarming? what did i say to that effect? :)

(01:09:30 PM) johnc4510: :)

(01:09:33 PM) johnc4510: lol

(01:09:52 PM) johnc4510: jk of course

(01:10:11 PM) pak33m: how about the next agenda topic...Possible LoCoTeams-specific subforum on Ubuntuforums

(01:10:40 PM) pak33m: doesnt this already exist?

(01:11:07 PM) johnc4510: maybe that means a us teams forum page

(01:11:07 PM) Joe_CoT: http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=183

(01:11:24 PM) Joe_CoT: it either means a US teams forum, or a LoCo teams forum

(01:11:55 PM) johnc4510: i discuss things in channel but not eveyone is always here to see or particpate in it

(01:12:05 PM) Joe_CoT: honestly, i don't think either would be very useful. Most of the people who do actual work 
on LoCo teams prefer mailing lists from what i've seen. the forums (mostly) sit empty

(01:12:26 PM) johnc4510: probably true

(01:12:38 PM) pak33m: ok, everybody agree that it exists already and move on?

(01:13:12 PM) pak33m: ow bout the next agenda topic...Integration of Regional LoCo teams to State Level Teams

(01:13:55 PM) Joe_CoT: .. i've never understood the point of regional teams :-/

(01:14:04 PM) johnc4510: me either

(01:14:18 PM) Joe_CoT: has anyone seen regionals ... do anything?

(01:14:19 PM) pak33m: there are a few i think...can anybody name em?

(01:14:23 PM) johnc4510: although texas and california are big states

(01:14:26 PM) pak33m: PNW is one

(01:14:42 PM) Joe_CoT: they

(01:14:42 PM) pak33m: does this also mean cities?

(01:14:45 PM) johnc4510: california has regionals i think

(01:14:46 PM) Joe_CoT: they're in the list here https://wiki.ubuntu.com/USTeams/TeamList

(01:15:19 PM) pak33m: ah, there quite a few

(01:15:49 PM) pak33m: i guess the biggest ? is how to get them to form up with state level teams?

(01:15:53 PM) johnc4510: if a state has regional teams they should be encouraged to unite    the regional team 
leaders should be encouraged to do so

(01:16:22 PM) pak33m: is that a job of the us teams or reg & state?

(01:16:50 PM) bordy is now known as bordy_away

(01:16:56 PM) johnc4510: well, the us teams should encourage this i think

(01:17:26 PM) johnc4510: but it has to be up to the states to make it happen

(01:17:37 PM) pak33m: do we invite them to the us teams meetingto discuss it or other?

(01:18:42 PM) johnc4510: i think we should make a plan to have a meeting with all the state team leaders to discuss 
such things

(01:18:52 PM) johnc4510: in channel

(01:19:11 PM) johnc4510: i think etank had this idea

(01:19:12 PM) johnc4510: ?

(01:19:48 PM) johnc4510: a meeting of the us teams and the state team leaders

(01:20:02 PM) pak33m: that sounds good

(01:20:19 PM) johnc4510: etank: what do you think

(01:20:25 PM) etank: one sec

(01:20:28 PM) johnc4510: kk

(01:20:31 PM) johnc4510: Joe_CoT: ?

(01:20:47 PM) Joe_CoT: will we really be able to get all the LoCo teams in the same place?

(01:21:06 PM) johnc4510: you mean the same channel?

(01:21:13 PM) johnc4510: at a certain time

(01:21:16 PM) Joe_CoT: well, more importantly, at the same time

(01:21:34 PM) johnc4510: it would be tricky probably

(01:21:37 PM) Joe_CoT: there's a lot of them, across time zones. we don't even have all the important ones here for 
this.

(01:21:39 PM) pak33m: maybe just the states and regions concerned?

(01:21:58 PM) Joe_CoT: would it work better as something less synchronous, like a forum post or mailing list?

(01:22:21 PM) etank: johnc4510: i think that it is a great idea

(01:23:00 PM) johnc4510: well, that gets back to having a us teams forum page to post to doesn't it

(01:23:45 PM) Joe_CoT: i suppose ...

(01:23:46 PM) johnc4510: i'm just thinking we could use a little more coordination with the state teams

(01:24:01 PM) johnc4510: hear what they think and need

(01:24:05 PM) pak33m: how bout a post on the state & regions forum about it

(01:24:14 PM) johnc4510: and what ideas we can help them with

(01:25:01 PM) pak33m: i think that we want to get them integrated? states & regions?

(01:25:08 PM) johnc4510: yes

(01:25:12 PM) johnc4510: if possible

(01:25:25 PM) pak33m: what if they dont wan t to?

(01:25:50 PM) johnc4510: well, i don't think we can force them

(01:25:52 PM) johnc4510: :)

(01:26:02 PM) Joe_CoT: yeah we can *pounds fists together*

(01:26:10 PM) johnc4510: LOL

(01:26:13 PM) etank: i may have missed some stuff

(01:26:14 PM) pak33m: he he

(01:26:41 PM) etank: there is US planet that we can syndicate to as teams

(01:26:56 PM) johnc4510: true

(01:26:57 PM) Joe_CoT: if we're approved

(01:26:58 PM) etank: that may help other areas see what a loco team actually does

(01:27:10 PM) etank: right. only for approved teams

(01:27:16 PM) Joe_CoT: how many ppl read the us team planet?

(01:27:17 PM) pak33m: maybe w should make a plan on how to get them integrated then propose it to them?

(01:27:26 PM) ***etank reads the us planet

(01:28:00 PM) etank: do we have some sort of easy to understand checklist for creating a team

(01:28:12 PM) etank: that would be good for interested people and us too

(01:28:20 PM) etank: to make sure that we are consistent

(01:28:49 PM) johnc4510: as far as i know just this  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LoCoTeamHowto

(01:29:13 PM) pak33m: etank: i think that this was talked about in the bof us teams at ubuntulive with Zelut

(01:30:03 PM) pak33m: ...and gettinf everybody on the same page

(01:30:14 PM) etank: right

(01:30:16 PM) johnc4510: k

(01:30:24 PM) etank: where is Zelut and atoponce ???

(01:30:34 PM) etank: Vorian too for that matter.

(01:32:49 PM) johnc4510: no objections from me

(01:33:02 PM) Joe_CoT: anything else? i think that's about it. Can someone summarize and get it on the mailing list 

later? I think we're about out (or items and patience :) )

(01:33:12 PM) johnc4510: :)

(01:33:14 PM) Joe_CoT: s/or/of

(01:33:15 PM) pak33m: in the florida team weve beenahving meetings every 1st & 3rd sunday of the month at least 
until we get built up and approved

(01:33:42 PM) johnc4510: once a month is plenty for us i think

(01:33:46 PM) pak33m: the meeting date/times will be posted both on the wiki and mailing list

(01:34:14 PM) Joe_CoT: ok :)

(01:34:17 PM) johnc4510: pak331: as meeting head you should do the summary and emial i think
