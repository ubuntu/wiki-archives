==== Ubuntu Developer Summit for Quantal ====

The Ubuntu Developer Summit for Quantal Quetzal went from May 7-11th with Ubuntu developers from all over the world - working on dozens of projects - coming to Oakland California to collaborate. In this issue we highlight some posts at the end of the Planet section from community members who have written about it so far.

==== EA Games and Ubuntu ====

Electronic Arts, a major American developer, marketer, publisher and distributor of video games, tests the waters by submitting two games to the Ubuntu Software Center. The game titles are “Command & Conquer Tiberium Alliances” and “Lord of Ultima” and Jono Bacon notes “Let’s not get side-tracked by the fact that these are web games and not native to Ubuntu: EA are dipping their toes in Ubuntu as a channel of opportunity, and let’s welcome them with open arms.”

Adnan Quantum of the Bangladesh Lo``Co team blogs about the Ubuntu 12.04 release party. The event had to be delayed by two weeks due to political unrest in the country, and participation was, unfortunately, hindered by lightning storms in the area.

=== Ubuntu Cloud News ===

==== Introducing Project Sputnik: Developer laptop ====

Dell plans to evaluate the possibility of building a laptop targeted at developers. The primary project goals are to identify and cater to the needs of potential customers, such as integration with Github and Open``Stack, and to improve hardware support. Due to its popularity among web developers, Ubuntu 12.04 came up as a natural choice of a pre-installed OS. To gather feedback from the Ubuntu developer, Dell had a representative and a session at the Ubuntu Developers Summit.

=== The Planet ===

==== Pasi Lallinaho: Brainstorm! Contribute! ====

==== Dustin Kirkland: Project Sputnik: Developer Focused Dell XPS13 ====

Dustin Kirkland delivers his first impressions on the new developer focused Dell XPS 13.  Aside from a lack of proper touchpad driver, he considers the ultrabook to be quite impressive and a real contender to the Macbook Air.

http://blog.dustinkirkland.com/2012/05/project-sputnik-developer-focused-dell.html

==== Alan Pope: Why not contribute to Ubuntu Manual ====

Alan Pope notes that the Ubuntu Manual project is looking for some new contributors, and questions the reasons why people might not be contributing. He mentions a few common reasons and calls for feedback as to how they can help people get involved.

==== ARM arrives on servers with Calxeda’s  Ubuntu demo ====

Calxeda, a server designer from Texas, has demonstrated an ARM based server prototype at the UDS. Running Precise Pangolin with LAMP, node.js and Ruby-on-Rails, it is supposed to “consume much less electricity then similar ones from Intel”. Calxeda believes ARM servers may reach as much as 40% of the total Linux server base in just three years.
