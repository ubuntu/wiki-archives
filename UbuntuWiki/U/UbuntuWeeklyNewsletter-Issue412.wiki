He goes over the various bits of hardware that worked out of the box or required installation of additional drivers (wifi) and writes of the 1920×1080 resolution screen that it’s “amazing how much screen Dell managed to fit in to this chassis” and that when compared to his Lenovo, the Dell has “much sharper text and a better contrast ratio.”

=== Canonical News ===

==== Predictive Maintenance on Industrial Turbines Explained via Duck Tape ====

Under the common assumption that predictive maintenance is the “killer app” of Industrial Internet of Things, Canonical shares a video and writes: “Via the use of a simple accelerometer and their open source Device``Hive solution on top of Snappy Ubuntu Core and Juju Charms anybody can build a predictive maintenance prototype involving industrial IoT, Cloud and Big Data easily.”

https://insights.ubuntu.com/2015/04/08/predictive-maintenance-on-industrial-turbines-explained-via-duck-tape/

https://insights.ubuntu.com/2015/04/08/uber-meets-iot/

==== The power of Software Defined Networking appliances – SDNA ====

Maarten Ectors of Canonical writes about how a server purchased for Mobile World Congress has been installed with Ubuntu Snappy Core and turned into a software defined networking appliances (SDNA). Specifically, he writes that it was turned into: "A switch, firewall and load balancer that shared performance data in real-time with Azure, was monitored by Zabbix from the cloud, device managed by ARM mbed Device Server, identity managed by Forgerock, an IoT wonder: All``Joyn compatible, being able to monitor local temperature and light intensity; making publicity via a connected scrolling display and an excellent robot arm controller."

=== In The Press ===

==== Intel Compute Stick with Ubuntu Linux is cheaper than Windows version ====

Chris Merriman for the Inquirer informs us that Intel's Compute Stick has started to appear as a pre-order item from some retailers and that $40 can be saved over the Windows version by having Linux pre-installed. He says that the Ubuntu version is $110, gives a very brief specification of the device, and informs us that retailers are claiming the Compute Stick will start shipping on 24th April.

http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2402969/intel-compute-stick-with-ubuntu-linux-is-cheaper-than-windows-version

==== BQ Aquaris E4.5 Ubuntu Edition review: A promising start ====

Terry Relph-Knight of ZDNet reviews the BQ Aquaris E4.5 Ubuntu Edition describing it as "a mid-range phone designed for Android." He looks at the Pros, the Cons, and with the aid of screenshots describes in detail swipes, the launcher, scopes, the Ubuntu App Store, audio and the camera. In his conclusion Terry says of the phone: "it's not yet ready for prime time. Ubuntu enthusiasts will get a buzz from seeing Canonical's promises starting to become a reality,  but neutral smartphone users are likely to be annoyed by the oddities and bugs in this new smartphone platform."

=== In The Blogosphere ===

==== There's Yet Another Awkward Ubuntu Linux Tablet Announced ====

Michael Larabel of Phoronix reports on a received email from Certrix of Malta. The email described their new tablet running a full Ubuntu 14.10 desktop. Though with decent specs it sadly does not run the tablet version of Ubuntu, but you do have the option to install Windows or Android.

==== Dell's stunning XPS 13 laptop now comes Ubuntu preloaded ====

http://www.techdrivein.com/2015/04/dell-xps13-ubuntu-edition.html

==== BQ Ubuntu Phone Now Available For General Purchase ====

Andrew of Web``Upd8 updates us with the news that the BQ Ubuntu Phone, which until now could only be bought through flash sales, is now available for general purchase. He gives us a brief specification of the phone, and reminds us that the phone targets early adopters as services such as Whats``App and Skype are not yet available.

http://www.webupd8.org/2015/04/bq-ubuntu-phone-now-available-for.html

==== Unity 8 Won't Be Very Different Visually from Unity 7 ====

Silviu Stahie of Softpedia addresses concerns over how Unity 8 will look on the desktop after users were concerned it would mirror the phone UI, which currently uses Unity 8. He talks about how Unity 8 will be an evolution, but writes: “Mark Shuttleworth has recently said that Canonical is looking to avoid another GNOME / Unity switch that would alienate a part of the community. The Ubuntu developers are working to keep that balance, so they will not be very far away from Unity 7, even some visual changes will be made.”
