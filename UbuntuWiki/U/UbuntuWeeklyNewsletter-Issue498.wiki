He says that the release is only a “security bugfix update” and shares a link to the release notes. Łukasz concludes his announcement by informing us, “The next future OTAs will most likely be very similar, concentrating only on critical security issues - until ubuntu-personal enters the touch world with its snaps.”

He says that this is the first point release that will come with the HWE [Hardware Enablement] stack from Ubuntu 16.10, and quotes Canonical’s Adam Conrad as saying “There are still some bits I need to tidy up to get server images going, but that shouldn't stop people from testing the desktop images.”
