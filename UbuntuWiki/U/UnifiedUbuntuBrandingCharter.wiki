==== D.3 Exclusions ====

Marketing efforts not directly related to Ubuntu Product branding will be considered out of scope.

 4. It is assumed the Marketing Team will craft a launch campaign for the new brands.

 5. It is assumed this project will be complete before the next release.

==== D.6 Constraints ====

 1. ''Current Marketing Focus is Vague''<<BR>><<BR>>Ubuntu lacks a published marketing plan and the current marketing efforts have grown from the individual development communities. This uncoordinated effort has resulted in product groups completing for the same market space. The fact the Community endorses a product by the same name gives it a market advantage over the other products endorsed by the Community. This advantage causes market friction as the other products attempt to reduce this advantage.

 2. ''Lack of Market Research''<<BR>><<BR>>At the moment there is no market research giving direction to the project. It is assumed industry norms will suffice and offer direction.

 3. ''Momentum of Status Quo''<<BR>><<BR>>There is momentum to the status quo. Publications have been printed, news has been disseminated, contacts established using the current marketing standards.

=== E. Project critical Success Factors ===

 1. Endorsement of the Marketing Team to proceed

 2. Endorsement of the Art Team to proceed

 3. Agreement from the Community to accept change

 4. Support of the Project Sponsors
