May 07 20:13:16 <pinwale>	thanks, man.
May 07 20:13:39 <UndiFineD>	mattgriffin are you still around ?
May 07 20:14:39 <pinwale>	Yeah, my father just suffered a heart attack this week so I kind of forgot. :/
May 07 20:15:53 <UndiFineD>	oof
May 07 20:15:58 <UndiFineD>	how is he now ?
May 07 20:16:33 <pinwale>	better, but he had three arteries blocked.
May 07 20:16:57 <pinwale>	The idiot waited 10 hours before DRIVING himself to the hospital.
May 07 20:17:15 <pinwale>	he collapsed in the emergency room.
May 07 20:17:33 <UndiFineD>	paracetamol and a shot of alcohol helps to thinner the blood
May 07 20:18:36 <pinwale>	He thought that he had a heartburn the whole time.
May 07 20:20:16 <UndiFineD>	well, I think the doctor would have given him the same advise, exercise, and a drink every so often
May 07 20:25:38 <pinwale>	No exercise for a while; they had to put in three stents in his arteries.
May 07 20:29:12 <Captainkrtek>	hello
May 07 20:29:25 <pinwale>	Hi
May 07 20:29:36 <Captainkrtek>	sorry I missed todays meeting :/ down with a cold
May 07 20:30:14 <Captainkrtek>	just reading the log
May 07 20:30:42 <pinwale>	Welcome to the late-comers meeting.  Yes, I missed the meeting, too!

May 07 20:34:11 <Captainkrtek>	mattgriffin, could I please get write access to the spreadsheet? steven.richardspc@gmail.com
May 07 20:45:11 <UndiFineD>	well feel free to expresion your thoughts regarding the campaigns
May 07 20:45:52 <UndiFineD>	we have been busy for some time and among such a small group it is hard to tell if we are going into the right directions
May 07 20:46:11 <Captainkrtek>	well I can give some input on the windows/teen segments
May 07 20:47:04 <UndiFineD>	yes, I am not of the youngest persons around anymore, but I have kids in that age territory ;)
May 07 20:48:53 <UndiFineD>	pinwale, you have our wiki now, you should be to find the lp team
May 07 20:49:00 <UndiFineD>	able*
May 07 20:49:06 <Captainkrtek>	heh well the main thing for teens these days is (especially in high school) is the use of social media
May 07 20:49:25 <Captainkrtek>	so we could advertise all the social media clients and IMing apps
May 07 20:49:29 <UndiFineD>	indeed
May 07 20:49:30 <Captainkrtek>	along with photo sharing
May 07 20:49:39 <Captainkrtek>	teens like to collaborate and share
May 07 20:49:50 <UndiFineD>	but we have games coming our way too, which i consider a good change
May 07 20:49:54 <Captainkrtek>	so showing how you can use things like Ubuntu One as well as to store your files online and access anywhere
May 07 20:51:46 <Captainkrtek>	Ubuntu also isn't very well known in terms of people outside the tech community
May 07 20:52:50 <Captainkrtek>	and if you look at the http://www.facebook.com/ubuntulinux page a few of the posts are people saying "im on mint, im on debian, im on fedora"
May 07 20:56:44 <UndiFineD>	true but that does not matter
May 07 20:57:06 <UndiFineD>	in fact I do like these alternatives
May 07 20:57:11 <pinwale>	oops, interwebs connection is flaky.
May 07 20:57:21 <Captainkrtek>	yeah
May 07 20:57:45 <Captainkrtek>	just saying the publicity of Ubuntu is not as out there to the general users as it could be
May 07 20:57:55 <Captainkrtek>	there are lots of ways to promote a product without money
May 07 20:58:06 <Captainkrtek>	I got 1000 people to fill out a survey in less than 24 hours
May 07 20:58:17 <UndiFineD>	I have been with many different distributions, but I am pretty much stable on ubuntu for a couple of years now
May 07 20:58:27 <Captainkrtek>	yeah same here
May 07 20:58:39 <pinwale>	Which is surprising considering the Hannah Montana distro.
May 07 20:58:42 <Captainkrtek>	we need to brand Ubuntu with a tagline or something people think of when they think ubuntu
May 07 20:58:46 <UndiFineD>	we actually have a survey running
May 07 20:58:48 <Captainkrtek>	pinwale, hehe

May 07 21:01:51 <Captainkrtek>	getting some other people with >2000 followers to RT it
May 07 21:02:03 <pinwale>	Twitter is pretty great.  It helped out greatly with World Backup Day.
May 07 21:02:07 <Captainkrtek>	yeah
May 07 21:02:17 <Captainkrtek>	Twitter, when you're known in it, can be a great tool

May 07 22:19:50 <Captainkrtek>	over the summer I plan to promote Ubuntu like crazy
May 07 22:20:05 <Captainkrtek>	you know what would be cool
May 07 22:20:13 <Captainkrtek>	a campaign of like "What is Ubuntu?"

May 07 22:20:53 <UndiFineD>	there are still possibilities there
May 07 22:20:56 <Captainkrtek>	yeah
May 07 22:21:35 <Captainkrtek>	there needs to be more publicity, for the general users and peeps out there
May 07 22:21:42 <Captainkrtek>	not just the tech community
May 07 22:22:58 <UndiFineD>	a lot of people already booked effectively simple success by making a flyer and drop it at the supermarkets and local computer stores
May 07 22:23:52 <Captainkrtek>	yeah
May 07 22:23:57 <Captainkrtek>	Ive put stickers around

May 07 22:24:29 <UndiFineD>	well, you can when their first contact is your phonenumber :)
May 07 22:24:32 <Captainkrtek>	hmm I have an idea for a flyer

May 07 22:24:48 <UndiFineD>	go ahead and have fun, be creative
May 07 22:25:01 <UndiFineD>	we already did some research you can use
May 07 22:25:03 <Captainkrtek>	will do :)
May 07 22:25:10 <Captainkrtek>	I have an idea for promotion
May 07 22:25:30 <UndiFineD>	and their may be useful items on the old marketing team
May 07 22:25:38 <Captainkrtek>	do we have a page of image resources?
May 07 22:25:59 <UndiFineD>	not yet, but it can be created
May 07 22:26:38 <UndiFineD>	we intend to stick to the ubuntu style guide lines
May 07 22:27:54 <UndiFineD>	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuAdverts/Brand
May 07 22:40:18 <Captainkrtek>	was thinking of a thing like a flyer that just has a link on it and the Ubuntu logo in the corner
May 07 22:40:23 <Captainkrtek>	and maybe a slogan up top
May 07 22:42:10 <Captainkrtek>	what do you think?
May 07 22:53:26 <Captainkrtek>	UndiFineD, you here?
May 07 22:53:38 <Captainkrtek>	UndiFineD, http://i.imgur.com/3p5ER.png
May 07 23:05:57 <UndiFineD>	sorry, helping my gf to pack for uds
May 07 23:07:46 <UndiFineD>	145, now we are getting close to something that represents ubuntu
May 07 23:13:02 <Captainkrtek>	?
May 07 23:13:06 <Captainkrtek>	145 clicks?
May 07 23:20:54 <UndiFineD>	149
May 07 23:20:57 <UndiFineD>	indeed
May 07 23:23:44 <UndiFineD>	I assume this will go on up to a day, unless it suddenly gets even more promotion from a different direction
May 07 23:24:20 <UndiFineD>	but around 160 / 170 we would have results from 1/10000 user
May 07 23:24:42 <UndiFineD>	on a global scale that must be good
May 07 23:24:55 <Captainkrtek>	yeah
May 07 23:24:57 <Captainkrtek>	also
May 07 23:25:01 <Captainkrtek>	what do you think of my little mockup?

May 07 23:25:27 <Captainkrtek>	lots of color
May 07 23:26:37 <UndiFineD>	when you stick to white bg, black and orange letters and details you have a higher success in getting it printed among the community
May 07 23:26:55 <UndiFineD>	also I would try to do it in svg
May 07 23:27:07 <UndiFineD>	so people can translate the content
May 07 23:28:53 <Captainkrtek>	yeah
May 07 23:29:57 <UndiFineD>	but it looks good I must admit
May 07 23:30:09 <UndiFineD>	color ads are great for web use
May 07 23:31:05 <Captainkrtek>	I suck at photoshop haha
May 07 23:41:07 <UndiFineD>	inkscape
May 07 23:42:13 <Captainkrtek>	yeah I used inkscape for that
May 07 23:48:42 <Captainkrtek>	just found a wallpaper, added the logo + text

May 09 19:00:43 <UndiFineD>	so we need kick ass releases next cycle end
May 09 19:00:49 <mattgriffin>	UndiFineD: yeah. i think that's probably about right
May 09 19:01:40 <UndiFineD>	we have had some 208 ? clicks on the url
May 09 19:01:54 <mattgriffin>	that's great :)
May 09 19:02:05 <UndiFineD>	so hopefully enough results to represent part of the community
May 09 19:02:13 <UndiFineD>	1/10000
May 09 19:02:38 <UndiFineD>	but I do not have access to the results
May 09 19:02:41 <UndiFineD>	never had
May 09 19:02:53 <mattgriffin>	does barry?
May 09 19:03:11 <UndiFineD>	maybe, or else cassidy / dante
May 09 19:03:44 <mattgriffin>	ok
May 09 20:17:44 <pinwale>	Hi!
May 09 20:18:00 <cwallis06>	Hello.
May 09 20:20:55 <UndiFineD>	hello
May 09 20:21:39 >cwallis06<	hello @ #ubuntu-adverts
May 09 21:04:08 <mattgriffin>	pinwale: ping
May 09 21:04:21 <pinwale>	hey
May 09 21:04:41 <mattgriffin>	pinwale: hi :) free to chat?
May 09 21:04:58 <pinwale>	Yeah
May 09 21:05:32 <mattgriffin>	pinwale: cool. what have you reviewed so far from the materials i've sent over about the ubuntu adverts project and the campaign?
May 09 21:06:24 <pinwale>	I skimmed over most of the stuff and the logs of the last meeting.
May 09 21:07:43 <mattgriffin>	pinwale: cool. one of your concerns seemed like the time required to help out. you said you were a bit busy. when do you think you'd be able to help out some?
May 09 21:08:49 <pinwale>	It's final exam week so probably next week before I can start any production.
May 09 21:09:39 <mattgriffin>	pinwale: ah. gotcha! i remember those days. they always seemed to start a James Bond marathon on TNT so I was often quite distracted
May 09 21:09:48 <pinwale>	haha!
May 09 21:11:32 <mattgriffin>	pinwale: what was your role in worldbackupday? how did that come about?
May 09 21:11:38 <pinwale>	Yeah, I'll be juggling a couple design projects as well.  So depending on how those go, production on the Ubuntu might take a month or two.
May 09 21:12:50 <mattgriffin>	pinwale: ok
May 09 21:13:24 <pinwale>	Basically I bought the domain, found a web designer, got sponserships/giveaways, conducted interviews, UI, etc.
May 09 21:13:56 <pinwale>	Basically anything and everything.  If I couldn't do it, I found somebody who could.
May 09 21:14:13 <mattgriffin>	pinwale: cool. that's great. what are you studying in school?
May 09 21:14:51 <pinwale>	Biology.  Yeah, it doesn't have anything to do with what I do.
May 09 21:14:57 <mattgriffin>	haha
May 09 21:15:04 <mattgriffin>	wow
May 09 21:15:31 <pinwale>	I like to do lots of stuff.
May 09 21:17:15 <pinwale>	Right now, one of my projects is to incorporate QR codes next to museum exhibits so that people can use them to get more info about the exhibit on the web.
May 09 21:18:10 <mattgriffin>	cool!
May 09 21:18:40 <mattgriffin>	pinwale: do you want to talk now about the project or wait until next week?
May 09 21:19:12 <pinwale>	Better to talk about it now so that I can be ready next week.
May 09 21:19:40 <mattgriffin>	pinwale: cool...
May 09 21:20:05 <mattgriffin>	pinwale: so the idea is to get more people to try the Ubuntu OS...
May 09 21:21:08 <mattgriffin>	pinwale: there are lots of ways to do this - they can download the iso file and burn a CD or make a USB stick to boot from ... this Try Ubuntu method doesn't affect their current OS but it does have a steep learning curve
May 09 21:21:19 <mattgriffin>	pinwale: a new trial method will be available soon...
May 09 21:22:27 <mattgriffin>	pinwale: people will be able to go to a website and try out the OS through their web browser... it won't affect their current OS and the learning curve is lower... this should be ready, i'm guessing, in a few weeks
May 09 21:22:59 <mattgriffin>	so, essentially, we want people to try out Ubuntu... specifically people that use Windows today
May 09 21:23:35 <mattgriffin>	pinwale: the thing that we want to use to draw people in to the trial methods is idea #6 at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuAdverts/Campaigns/education/Team0
May 09 21:24:27 <pinwale>	Do you have any URLs talking about the browser trial?  If Ubuntu wants to make a splash on launch day then we are going to need to move fast.
May 09 21:25:32 <mattgriffin>	don't have the final URL but it will probably be at http://www.ubuntu.com/download/ubuntu/download
May 09 21:26:07 <pinwale>	Also, I think that Idea 6 is too broad.  "Unclutter Your PC" can be twisted to mean clean up your Mac or Windows PC.  Blogs would just write about decluttering the registry or the descktop.
May 09 21:26:13 <mattgriffin>	so for idea #6, we're focusing on Ubuntu strengths of a clean, uncluttered desktop and polished user interface
May 09 21:27:50 <pinwale>	I meant source that I can read about for the "browser trial" feature.
May 09 21:28:04 <mattgriffin>	pinwale: ah.. 1 sec
May 09 21:29:21 <pinwale>	Also, is there going to be an official campaign with the release of the trial feature?
May 09 21:29:27 <mattgriffin>	pinwale: http://www.thinq.co.uk/2011/5/4/canonical-ready-put-ubuntu-cloud/
May 09 21:29:27 <pinwale>	no prob.
May 09 21:30:31 <mattgriffin>	pinwale: don't know. if there is a campaign it will be focused on PR. that's where canonical focuses almost exclusively now
May 09 21:31:14 <mattgriffin>	by PR, i mean reaching blog authors (for enthusiast users) and business analysts (for business users)
May 09 21:31:50 <pinwale>	That's even better.  Canonical can spread the word about our mini-site.
May 09 21:31:51 <mattgriffin>	so our focus consumer segment will most likely not be on the radar for the launch
May 09 21:32:31 <mattgriffin>	of course. lots of ways to get the word out from canonical people especially through the Ubuntu community of users
May 09 21:32:31 <pinwale>	We need the tech bloggers to spread the initial word.  They are the gatekeepers.
May 09 21:33:41 <pinwale>	Second, the minisite should be emotional if it is going to target consumers.
May 09 21:33:54 <mattgriffin>	pinwale: i'll check with the canonical marketing department if there is any consumer-focused launch messaging and what that might be... so we can try to align our message through the mini-site
May 09 21:34:27 <mattgriffin>	pinwale: yeah. on the surface idea #6 focuses on rational benefit ...
May 09 21:35:33 <pinwale>	yeah, consumers don't think rationally, even when they are supposedly being rational.
May 09 21:35:41 <mattgriffin>	pinwale: but there could also be an emotional angle. when you have a bunch of crap on you machine, you end of taking lots of time to deal with it. you might be searching for solutions on the Internet or waiting on hold on the phone for hours... that's time that you'll never get back and also time away from other parts of your life ... like spending time with your kids, exercising, etc.
May 09 21:36:15 <mattgriffin>	the Windows Phone 7 ads that are all about getting rid of distractions so you can get on with life are along the same theme
May 09 21:37:30 <mattgriffin>	almost like making backups...
May 09 21:37:57 <mattgriffin>	of course making backups is a good idea but the emotional side is to think about all of those vacation pictures that could disappear forever
May 09 21:39:28 <mattgriffin>	i agree that rational is not an effective approach to reach most consumers
May 09 21:39:38 <pinwale>	Yeah, but "get a uncluttered computer" sounds like a mother scolding her kids.
May 09 21:39:44 <pinwale>	Just think about the brand identity of major corps.
May 09 21:39:47 <pinwale>	Apple --> Magical  BMW ---> Ultimate   Mercedes --->German Luxury   ....etc.
May 09 21:40:27 <mattgriffin>	it's more about always having a fresh computer ... rather than a stale one
May 09 21:41:00 <UndiFineD>	http://www.edubuntu.org/weblive
May 09 21:41:04 <mattgriffin>	so unclutter is definitely a bad word to you use .. i like your mother scolding her kids description
May 09 21:41:31 <pinwale>	Maybe something like "get a whole new computer"
May 09 21:41:34 <mattgriffin>	UndiFineD: thanks! pinwale: ^ this is basically the experience of the upcoming browser demo of Ubuntu
May 09 21:42:21 <UndiFineD>	I had another url :: ?????42.ubuntu.com or something likethat
May 09 21:42:45 <UndiFineD>	but that site only siad test is over
May 09 21:43:04 <mattgriffin>	pinwale: exactly :) that's what goes through people's heads when they have a slow computer full of crap... and what fixmypc.com plays to when they run their tv ads ... many consumers think that fixing this problem will require them to buy a new computer
May 09 21:43:25 <mattgriffin>	UndiFineD: cool. thanks for providing that example
May 09 21:43:36 <pinwale>	no prob.
May 09 21:44:07 <mattgriffin>	pinwale: so unclutter is definitely not the word. it's a very negative word and doesn't really describe the benefit/warm-fuzzy feeling
May 09 21:44:29 <mattgriffin>	getting a new computer for free does describe the benefit
May 09 21:46:15 <pinwale>	I think a supporting branding campaign for the minisite would be a good addition as well.
May 09 21:46:59 <mattgriffin>	pinwale: in addition to idea #6 (the mini-site)?
May 09 21:47:27 <pinwale>	Basically, have the minisite as the star of the campaign and then have a bunch of ads with just the ubuntu logo.
May 09 21:47:46 <pinwale>	to keep the Ubuntu name in people's mind.
May 09 21:48:26 <UndiFineD>	mattgriffin, I did some counting on ubuntu-nl users
May 09 21:48:27 <UndiFineD>	http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7607669/U-NL/forum.ods
May 09 21:48:44 <UndiFineD>	there is a graph at the bottom
May 09 21:49:22 <UndiFineD>	since I did this manually, I miscounted 115
May 09 21:49:29 <UndiFineD>	they are missing somewhere
May 09 21:50:09 <mattgriffin>	pinwale: there are some existing marketing resources that could be used from https://wiki.ubuntu.com/marketing/Home
May 09 21:50:10 <UndiFineD>	not bad on 500 pages showing 30 users per page
May 09 21:50:23 <mattgriffin>	UndiFineD: heh
May 09 21:50:39 <pinwale>	I'll be honest.  I don't know the what I just downloaded.  Does it require linux.  I'm running Mac OS X if that matters.
May 09 21:50:57 <mattgriffin>	pinwale: requires Open Office or Libre Office
May 09 21:51:01 <UndiFineD>	open office document pinwale 
May 09 21:51:27 <UndiFineD>	eh yes libre office, set free by oracle :D
May 09 21:51:44 <mattgriffin>	pinwale: most of the Ubuntu marketing done by the community is around release time every 6 moths in April and October ... a lot of people put banners on their website and facebook pages to promote the upcoming release
May 09 21:51:46 <pinwale>	I think it was set free FROM Oracle.
May 09 21:51:48 <mattgriffin>	UndiFineD: heh
May 09 21:52:05 <mattgriffin>	heh
May 09 21:52:49 <pinwale>	mattgriffin: Yeah, but people who go to those website aren't our target audience.
May 09 21:53:27 <UndiFineD>	well, for oktober noveber and december we need to aim for an additional ? 33 milion users
May 09 21:53:42 <UndiFineD>	to be on track
May 09 21:54:17 <UndiFineD>	do governments count here ?
May 09 21:54:24 <pinwale>	mattgriffin: because we are targeting a new market, we don't really have to adure to the release schedule.
May 09 21:55:05 <pinwale>	Actually, it would be better to target in the middle of the cycle because all the kinks of the new release have been fixed/figured out.
May 09 21:55:47 <mattgriffin>	pinwale: gotcha. yeah. there are definitely lulls in mentions of Ubuntu in the summer and winter
May 09 21:55:53 <mattgriffin>	in the press
May 09 21:56:08 <UndiFineD>	that has been spoken of today as well, to delay upgrades for casual users
May 09 21:56:34 <mattgriffin>	UndiFineD: which session? mark's keynote?
May 09 21:56:46 <UndiFineD>	no, desktop roundtable
May 09 21:56:56 <mattgriffin>	interesting
May 09 21:57:16 <UndiFineD>	that would give time for slider mistakes
May 09 21:58:06 <pinwale>	crap.  Google Docs doesn't open the file and Mac OS thinks it's a zip file.
May 09 21:58:10 <mattgriffin>	pinwale: so the ads - very brand focused, keep the name and product top-of-mind for viewers. don't have a budget to promote them but might be able to get donations or some assistance with canonical if they align with their marketing goals
May 09 21:58:20 <mattgriffin>	pinwale: can't import into gDocs?
May 09 21:58:40 <pinwale>	mattgriffin: nope.
May 09 21:58:59 <pinwale>	well, I can but it can't read it.
May 09 21:59:09 <mattgriffin>	pinwale: i think it's time to switch to Ubuntu ;) ... or download Libre Office - http://www.libreoffice.org/download/
May 09 21:59:50 <UndiFineD>	http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7607669/UAT/Screenshot.png
May 09 22:00:00 <UndiFineD>	that is what matters really
May 09 22:00:38 *	ChanServ gives voice to mattgriffin
May 09 22:01:48 <pinwale>	Wait. I had to convert it to google's format.  Graph looks a little mangled though.
May 09 22:02:16 <UndiFineD>	well the screenshot 
May 09 22:02:21 <UndiFineD>	is good enough
May 09 22:02:51 <UndiFineD>	once started and promoted there has been a steady growth of forum users
May 09 22:03:16 <UndiFineD>	and we can somewhat predict new users over time
May 09 22:03:40 <pinwale>	yeah.
May 09 22:04:18 <UndiFineD>	with the new gaol, the curve has to become a lot more steap?
May 09 22:04:44 <mattgriffin>	UndiFineD: so this is a graph of the # of ubuntuforums users?
May 09 22:04:54 <UndiFineD>	nu ubuntu-nl forum users
May 09 22:05:05 <mattgriffin>	gotcha
May 09 22:05:43 <pinwale>	Do the users have to be register to count?
May 09 22:05:50 <pinwale>	*registered
May 09 22:05:55 <UndiFineD>	which is the biggest collection of users for my loco
May 09 22:06:02 <UndiFineD>	yes they do
May 09 22:06:26 <UndiFineD>	no anonymous posts
May 09 22:07:04 <mattgriffin>	gotta jump on a phone call
May 09 22:07:16 <UndiFineD>	ok
May 09 22:07:29 <pinwale>	okay.  I had to go to the restroom anyways.  :D
May 09 22:07:55 <UndiFineD>	now what could be done is large scale flyer distribution
May 09 22:08:31 <UndiFineD>	I think that has not been done here
May 09 22:10:11 <mattgriffin>	back
May 09 22:12:01 <mattgriffin>	ok. making a scratch todo list for campaign 1 - http://openetherpad.org/zYQUMWFfZ0
May 09 22:12:09 <mattgriffin>	pinwale, UndiFineD: ^
May 09 22:12:18 <UndiFineD>	there :)
May 09 22:20:13 <pinwale>	I'm back.
May 09 22:21:58 <mattgriffin>	pinwale: just making a todo list
May 09 22:24:35 <pinwale>	I have a great date.
May 09 22:25:31 <UndiFineD>	911 ?
May 09 22:25:46 <pinwale>	Shuttleworth loves space.  STS-135 will be lifting off end of June.
May 09 22:26:14 <UndiFineD>	wasnt it planned for tomorrow ?
May 09 22:26:21 <pinwale>	Tech blogs like to talk about tech stuff related to current event.
May 09 22:26:31 <pinwale>	No, that was STS-134.
May 09 22:26:33 <mattgriffin>	pinwale: i like it
May 09 22:27:48 <pinwale>	Also, regular news like to have news pieces that are tangental the main event, i.e. the last space shuttle mission.
May 09 22:28:24 <mattgriffin>	it would be nice to coincide with a holiday (annual event) but this is good
May 09 22:28:34 <pinwale>	We could have a site to countdown the day to the launch.
May 09 22:29:25 <pinwale>	we can choose another day next year.  This is gold, b/c shuttleworth has been to space before.
May 09 22:29:39 <mattgriffin>	it works for me
May 09 22:29:40 <pinwale>	We could have a site to countdown the day to the launch.
May 09 22:29:49 <mattgriffin>	unless they delay the launch ;)
May 09 22:30:11 <pinwale>	Maybe even a web cam of the launch, etc.
May 09 22:30:31 <mattgriffin>	pinwale: cool. lots of good layers to it
May 09 22:30:41 <UndiFineD>	we could implement nasa counter :P
May 09 22:30:52 <UndiFineD>	to have same values
May 09 22:30:56 <pinwale>	with ubuntu branding announcing the new "browser" feature.
May 09 22:31:56 <pinwale>	We could also coordinate with NASA astronauts to offer testimonials about their experiences with Ubuntu.
May 09 22:32:01 <UndiFineD>	mattgriffin, maybe those users could fill a survey to recieve a cd ?
May 09 22:32:01 <pinwale>	^joke
May 09 22:32:35 <mattgriffin>	i think mark might know one of them that's going up on the next mission or the final one
May 09 22:32:37 <pinwale>	I think that they are closing the CD sending down.
May 09 22:32:40 <mattgriffin>	;)
May 09 22:33:07 <pinwale>	* CD sending program
May 09 22:33:17 <pinwale>	mattgriffin: hah
May 09 22:34:40 <pinwale>	It would really great if we could coordinate with the Canonical marketing team so that
May 09 22:34:50 <UndiFineD>	well, I do not know when weblive is ready
May 09 22:35:12 <pinwale>	we can be ready when weblive would be ready.
May 09 22:35:37 <UndiFineD>	and perhaps new users are more interested in filling a survey when they recieve something
May 09 22:35:48 <mattgriffin>	UndiFineD: as long as it is live by the time the campaign is running, it's okay. both don't have to be launched at the same time... the weblive experience can still be "NEW" for a few months :)
May 09 22:35:55 <UndiFineD>	which would give us an idea on how to target them better
May 09 22:36:29 <mattgriffin>	my guess is that weblive will be available in a few weeks. i don't think we have to link this event and the launch of weblive
May 09 22:37:41 <mattgriffin>	what i'm saying is that the shuttle launch will definitely be after the weblive launch... possibly a few months. that's okay in my opinion.
May 09 22:37:56 <mattgriffin>	maybe not a few months ;)
May 09 22:38:10 *	mattgriffin realizes it's may already
May 09 22:39:43 <pinwale>	the mini-site doesn't have to be directly linked to the weblive launch, but the steam will be lost if Canonical pushes a PR campaign without coordinating with us.
May 09 22:40:03 <mattgriffin>	i wonder about the strength of the brand new PC message in light of the idea to link to the final shuttle launch. should there be a link? should we drop the 'new PC' idea and focus on the shuttle launch - new frontier, browsing the world, etc.
May 09 22:41:08 <UndiFineD>	oh wait, 12.04 is P for penguin, that would give lots of marketing possibilities
May 09 22:41:59 <pinwale>	If Canonical does a soft launch and then starts their PR campaign in concert with us, there would be more impact.
May 09 22:42:10 <UndiFineD>	where linux had been ridiculed over the years, that could be a great time to strike back
May 09 22:42:43 <pinwale>	As for the message, we can have a variation of the "new computer" theme.
May 09 22:42:56 <mattgriffin>	pinwale: i see your point. i don't know canonical's pr plans for the weblive launch but, considering where we are right now, they won't alter their plans
May 09 22:43:12 <pinwale>	As for the yearly event, 12.04 sounds great.
May 09 22:44:22 <pinwale>	wait. you meant the release number.  :D
May 09 22:44:34 <mattgriffin>	hehe
May 09 22:45:23 <mattgriffin>	pinwale: yes. 12.04 = 26 April 2012
May 09 22:46:24 <pinwale>	mattgriffin: I was thinking December = 12
May 09 22:47:00 <mattgriffin>	:)
May 09 22:47:27 <UndiFineD>	it does fit nicely there
May 09 22:48:06 <UndiFineD>	so if our campaign is launched, what are we using here ?
May 09 22:49:06 <pinwale>	huh?
May 09 22:50:59 <UndiFineD>	what simple message is going to draw in the hords
May 09 22:51:15 <pinwale>	the final space shuttle launch is targeted to be around 28 June 2011.
May 09 22:51:36 <pinwale>	Something about a new computer...
May 09 22:51:55 <pinwale>	I don't remember my ideas...
May 09 22:52:54 <mattgriffin>	the shuttle is browsing the world from space. you can now browse your new computer from the comfort of home... with weblive (or whatever it'll be called)
May 09 22:53:44 <pinwale>	"see the world with Ubuntu"
May 09 22:54:08 <mattgriffin>	yeah
May 09 22:54:13 <pinwale>	"Ubuntu: the FInal Solution"
May 09 22:54:20 <pinwale>	nvm that.
May 09 22:54:36 <mattgriffin>	hehe
May 09 22:54:44 <pinwale>	Ubuntu: The final frontier
May 09 22:54:47 <pinwale>	nah.
May 09 22:55:52 <pinwale>	"A whole new world. A whole new computer. Ubuntu"
May 09 22:56:16 <pinwale>	"Ready for any mission. Ubuntu"
May 09 22:56:55 <pinwale>	"Houston. We have Ubuntu."
May 09 22:58:19 <pinwale>	btw STS-135 is target to be around 28 June 2011.
May 09 23:01:03 <UndiFineD>	back
May 09 23:01:15 <UndiFineD>	well, I need some coffee to stay awake
May 09 23:03:22 <mattgriffin>	UndiFineD: :)
May 09 23:06:23 <pinwale>	Do we have a server with FTP access?
May 09 23:09:23 <UndiFineD>	people.ubuntu.com :P
May 09 23:10:40 <pinwale_>	whoops.
May 09 23:11:12 <pinwale_>	crappy interwebs connection.
May 09 23:11:22 <mattgriffin>	:)
May 09 23:13:19 <UndiFineD>	launch.ubuntu.com
May 09 23:13:27 <UndiFineD>	could that be done mattgriffin ?
May 09 23:13:47 <pinwale_>	oh yeah!
May 09 23:14:37 <pinwale_>	but first we are going to need a server to dev the website.
May 09 23:15:42 <UndiFineD>	lets see what we can hack together in the weekend perhaps
May 09 23:16:18 <UndiFineD>	dropbox allows me to host sites, do not think ubuntu one can
May 09 23:16:26 <mattgriffin>	UndiFineD, pinwale_: that url might be possible. we'd need to be pretty buttoned up on the plan and site
May 09 23:16:40 <UndiFineD>	http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7607669/SC/index.xhtml
May 09 23:17:27 <mattgriffin>	UndiFineD: i think u1 would force you to download the html files rather than displaying them in the browser
May 09 23:17:44 <mattgriffin>	i need to run in a few min
May 09 23:17:50 <UndiFineD>	i understand
May 09 23:17:56 <pinwale_>	URL is not the prob. We need server access to make the website even if it is a donated mediatemple account.
May 09 23:18:03 <pinwale_>	okay.
May 09 23:18:37 <UndiFineD>	well, we could use LP to share that too hmm
May 09 23:18:52 <mattgriffin>	UndiFineD: right. LP or github
May 09 23:19:00 <mattgriffin>	whichever people are comfortable with
May 09 23:19:02 <UndiFineD>	exactly
May 09 23:19:10 <mattgriffin>	don't need hosting yet
May 09 23:20:36 <mattgriffin>	ok. gotta run. i'll probably be back later
May 09 23:21:22 <pinwale_>	All right, I'll see what I can do over the weekend.
May 09 23:22:33 <mattgriffin>	pinwale_: sweet!
May 09 23:22:49 <pinwale_>	no promises...
May 09 23:26:05 <pinwale>	Ugh. Damn internet connection.
May 09 23:27:53 <mattgriffin>	pinwale: jump in this channel every now and then and we can bounce ideas around. i can see where I can help as well
May 09 23:28:23 <pinwale>	yeah, i'll do that.
May 09 23:29:29 <UndiFineD>	I was already looking at some stuff to use
May 09 23:29:40 <UndiFineD>	thanks mattgriffin and pinwale 
May 09 23:29:52 <UndiFineD>	it is about bedtime for me now
May 09 23:29:55 <pinwale>	share?

May 09 23:36:08 <UndiFineD>	404 ?
May 09 23:37:41 <pinwale_>	damn it, again.
May 09 23:46:21 <pinwale_>	I think that's fixed now.
