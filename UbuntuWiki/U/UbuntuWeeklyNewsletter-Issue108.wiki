==== Introducing Jaunty Jackalope ====

Mark Shuttleworth has announced the name for the proposed Ubuntu release 9.04, and it will be "Jaunty Jackalope." Specific goals for this warrior rabbit will be addressed at the Ubuntu Developer's Summit in Mountain View on the 8th - 12th of December. Included in the new release will be faster boot time and resume time, blurring the difference between web services and desktop applications. The move of all of Ubuntu into Bazaar should provide an intricate pattern of collaboration between developers in a distributed version control system.

The challenge that Mark has set, is to provide customers of the several million devices being shipped with Ubuntu with an experience comparable to Microsoft or Apple. This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance to shine, and Mark wants to make sure that the very best thinking across the whole open source ecosystem is reflected in Jaunty Jackalope since many people will judge free software as a whole, by what we do. https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel-announce/2008-September/000481.html

==== UI Freeze in place, Alpha 6 freeze ahead ====

The sixth and final alpha testing milestone for Intrepid Alpha 6 is scheduled for next Thursday, September 18th. Intrepid Alpha 6 will again use a "soft freeze" for main Developers are asked to refrain from uploading packages that aren't essential to the release of the Alpha from Tuesday through Thursday. This is so the archive can be set, and the last show stoppers can be fixed. See the link for further information. The list of bugs targeted for alpha-6 can be found at: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/intrepid/+bugs?field.milestone%3Alist=1324

https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel-announce/2008-September/000483.html

==== Last push for Intrepid documentation ====

The User Interface (UI) for Intrepid Ibex is now in a freeze state.  This leaves about 3 weeks for errors to be found in the documentation before the string freeze takes place.  Here's an opportunity to help make the documentation better.  If you have Intrepid installed, please scan the documentation and submit bug reports on any errors, omissions and typos. http://oldsoldiers.wordpress.com/2008/09/12/last-push-for-intrepid-documentation/

==== Status of Ubuntu Romanian Localization Team ====

Adi Roiban has issued the first of a series of updates on the localization of Ubuntu to Romanian. Currently, about 27.5% is done, with most of it Launchpad, and 2 major packages done in Narro. The team has almost all GNOME and configuration utilities translated, including the live cd menu, installation program, and Ubuntu guides. They plan to translate all the GNOME packages and the GNOME GUI, then start working on the Ubuntu Desktop Course.  http://adi.roiban.ro/?p=68

==== Ubuntu Developer Week ====

Ubuntu Developer Week happened from Sept. 1st to Sept. 5th in #ubuntu-classroom on irc.freenode.net. 25 IRC sessions happened with involvement from developers of all sorts of teams. At peak times we had more than 200 participants. Here a quick overview what happened throughout the week. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDeveloperWeek

* Day 1:
** "Packaging 101" was packed with people and although we just had one hour to go through the bare-bone structure of the hello-debhelper package, we had a great time and the participants were a very sharp bunch, and asked very clever questions. Awesome! https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MeetingLogs/devweek0809/Package
** Jorge Castro’s "Upstream Bug Linkages" also went great. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MeetingLogs/devweek0809/Upstream He got lots of questions about the process of linking Ubuntu bugs to Upstream bugs, which helps a lot to bring developers closer together. In addition to the session log, check out "Bugs/Upstream" for more information. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bugs/Upstream
** Iulian Udrea had a very busy time in "Introduction to MOTU". Everybody wanted to know more about our Master of the Universe team and how to get involved. Iulian covered a lot of ground, talking about processes, meetings, and people. He conveyed a good feeling for how the team works. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MeetingLogs/devweek0809/MOTUIntro
** Celso Providelo was up next and talked about "Soyuz and all that Jazz". Lots and lots of questions came up and Celso did his best to answer all of them, he even drew a fancy diagram to explain what Soyuz is all about. I’d like to note that the audience of this session likes Rock’n'Roll more than Jazz. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MeetingLogs/devweek0809/Soyuz
** Pedro Villavivencio Garrido spent almost an hour talking about tips and tricks working with "Ubuntu and GNOME QA". If you know Pedro, you know how enthusiastic he is about spreading the Ubuntu and GNOME love. That’s what he did in the session. He covered using GNOME’s Bugzilla, talked about the GNOME Love project, freedesktop components, and lots of other stuff. Awesome! https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MeetingLogs/devweek0809/UbuntuGnomeQA
* Day 2:
** "How do I fix an Ubuntu bug?" was a lot of fun. Lots of sharp questions, and lots of really good fixes by the end of the session. We used Harvest to find some low-hanging fruit, verified the bug, tested the fix, test-built it and came up with a collection of good debdiffs. Yeeeehaw! Lots of excitement among the crowd! https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MeetingLogs/devweek0809/FixingBugs1
** The audience had a good time with David Futcher who was up next with his "Introduction to BZR". David shared a lot of insights into bzr and code hosting on Launchpad and everybody seemed quite pleased. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MeetingLogs/devweek0809/BazaarIntro
** Super Mario Limonciello joined us to take the plunge and experience the joys of "Kernel module packaging with DKMS". His presentation was concise, to the point and demonstrated quite impressively, why DKMS is the way to go. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MeetingLogs/devweek0809/DKMSPackage
** Leonard Richardson (with the help of Barry Warsaw and Francis Lacoste) demonstrated "The Launchpad Web Service API" and got a huge amount of questions. I guess we’re going to see a lot of scripts and applications making use of the Launchpad API soon. Thanks a lot Launchpad Heroes! https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MeetingLogs/devweek0809/LaunchpadWebService
** At the end of day 2, Brian Murray demonstrated his "Launchpad Hacks" and how to make use of Greasemonkey to change bits of the functionality of Launchpad pages, add additional information, etc. With Brian’s background in QA work it was pretty obvious to see how these hacks make working with bugs a lot easier. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MeetingLogs/devweek0809/LaunchpadHacks
* Day 3:
** James Westby started off with "BZR for packaging". The atmosphere was great, and James demonstrated very, very well, why bzr for packaging makes the world a better place and yourself much more productive. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MeetingLogs/devweek0809/BZRPackage
** Cesare Tirabassi took over and explained "How to update a package properly". There was lots of MOTU participation in the sesion, so lots of questions could easily be answered. Excellent session! https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MeetingLogs/devweek0809/PackageUpdates
** Mathias Gug was next and did an "Introduction to the Server Team". A great session: he introduced everybody to the current team members, explained what areas of interested the team works on, where to find easy tasks to get involved, and answered loads and loads of questions! ROCK ON Server People! https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MeetingLogs/devweek0809/ServerTeam
** This is the umpteenth time that Celso Providelo gave his rocking "Introduction to PPA" session. You could call him a veteran of Ubuntu Open and Developer Weeks. It was just awesome to see how many questions popped up, how many ideas were discussed, interest in PPAs is definitely very very high. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MeetingLogs/devweek0809/PPAIntro
** Christophe Sauthier and Didier Roche did a 1h30m-session about "Various ways to patch packages". No matter if it was quilt, CDBS’ simple-patchsys, dpatch or anything else: these two guys from France managed to give everybody the perfect overview. Rock’n'Roll! https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MeetingLogs/devweek0809/PackagePatches
* Day 4:
** Ara Pulido kicked off the day with "Automated Testing of the Desktop". Ara showed us what amazing stuff she was working on. In examples she showed how easy it has become nowadays to test the integral parts of our Ubuntu Desktop. The audience asked lots of interesting questions any everybody left the session with a much better idea of what’s happening in #ubuntu-testing. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MeetingLogs/devweek0809/AutoTests
** Afterwards Daniel Holbach did another session called "How do I fix an Ubuntu bug". The main aim of this session was to demonstrate how easy it is with Harvest and the Ubuntu development tools to make Ubuntu better. You don’t need a degree in rocket science, just a knack for trying to make things work again, some patience, and being good at team-play. The session was well-attended and the questions showed that the audience was clearly motivated to shake out bugs of Ubuntu. We even managed to fix two bugs during the session. The shipment of awesome-ness clearly has arrived! https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MeetingLogs/devweek0809/FixingBugs2
** Jonathan Riddell delivered the third session that day and showed how to write a "Web``Kit browser in PyKDE". Everybody was very impressed by how easy it is to use Web``Kit in PyKDE. Have a look at the examples yourself: this is clearly next-generation awesome stuff. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MeetingLogs/devweek0809/PyKDEWebkit
** Alexander Sack afterwards gave a great introduction to "Having fun with the Mozilla Team". This is one of the very very busy teams we all expect the best from. Alexander explained all the areas that require work (extensions, bug work, maintenance of all mozilla-related packages, etc.) At the end of the session he demonstrated the ease of packaging Mozilla extension. Rock and Roll! https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MeetingLogs/devweek0809/MozillaTeam
** Steve Langasek as one of the Heroes of the Archive Admins delivered a great session on "How to avoid making Archive Admins unhappy". The session was a great opportunity to find out almost everything that’s reviewed with great scrutiny, especially since the session was a relaxed discussion, it invited everybody to join in. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MeetingLogs/devweek0809/Archives
* Day 5
** Matt Zimmerman kicked off with "Ask Matt". He answered a myriad of questions about Ubuntu Development plans, syncing of upstream and distro schedules, distributed development, Canonical partners, and lots of other interesting topics. If you read the log you can imagine how fast Matt was typing to answer the questions. Rock On, Matt! https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MeetingLogs/devweek0809/AskMdz
** Lars Wirzenius talked about "Unit testing Python Code, with code coverage measurement". He did a great job at explaining the bits and pieces needed to write better code and get it tested. The audience was very interested, and will hopefully make Lars proud with their next Python projects. :-) https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MeetingLogs/devweek0809/PyUnitTests
** The "Introduction to the Installer Team" was up next, and Evan Dandrea held a great session about it. It’s worth pointing out how modest Evan was, and how he introduced everybody who’s involved with the team. He also gave a quick update about what’s happening with the team right now, and invited everybody to join in on the fun. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MeetingLogs/devweek0809/InstallerTeam
** The "Introduction to the Security Team" session was packed with people who wanted to see Jamie Strandboge, Kees Cook and William Grant talk about their favorite topic. They started off with a quick introduction to the life cycle of a security issue, areas in which the team is active, proper testing of security fixes and so on. Lots and lots of great questions. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MeetingLogs/devweek0809/SecurityTeam
** Ben Collins had the last slot of this week, talking about "The Kernel Team". Current plans, DKMS goodness, 2.6.26 vs 2.6.27, and lots of other lively discussion happened. Everybody saw how much fun the Kernel can be. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MeetingLogs/devweek0809/Kernel

=== In The Press ===

* The Jaunty Jackalope Hops Aboard Ubuntu’s Ark - Ashlee Vance of '''The New York Times''' reports on the naming of the Ubuntu 9.04 release. Jaunty Jackalope is now added to the other animal names that have helped establish Ubuntu as a legitimate player in the desktop and server OS markets. In an email interview, Mark Shuttleworth admitted that, "We learned a while ago that our sanity depended on making the names alphabetical" but that it's not a sophisticated process. Ashlee also reports that Canonical will be releasing Intrepid Ibex next month.  http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/09/the-jaunty-jackalope-hops-aboard-ubuntus-ark/

* Ubuntu 9.04 to be called Jaunty Jackalope - Ryan Paul of Ars Technica reports on the naming of Ubuntu 9.04. Included in the article is a graphic of Mark Shuttleworth, "our intrepid explorer", riding a jackalope.(Everyone should check out this graphic!) Ryan reports that Mark believes that Ubuntu is ready to compete with Microsoft Windows and Mack OS-X.  Development of the Jaunty Jackalope release will begin following the release of Ubuntu 8.10, Intrepid Ibex.  Ubuntu is popular in the desktop Linux ecosystem and is moving into the general consumer market. Dell is already shipping Ubuntu on the new Mini 9 netbook.  http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080908-ubuntu-9-04-to-be-called-jaunty-jackalope.html

* Canonical to fund upstream Linux usability improvements - Ryan Paul, of Ars Technica reports that Mark Shuttleworth announced Wednesday that Canonical will hire professional designers, and interaction experts to work with upstream developers to improve desktop software. In the past, Canonical has not had the resources to make big contributions to upstream code. Now, it will be able to work on X, Open``GL, Gtk, Qt, GNOME and KDE, to turn ideas into reality over the range of desktop experience.  http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080911-canonical-to-fund-upstream-linux-usability-improvements.html

* Computer Music #129 article: Ubuntu Studio - Ubuntu Studio recently got a write up in CM(Computer Music) Magazine that was very complementary of the distribution. Calling it the miracle OS based on the Ubuntu operating system, it is packed with the latest Linux based free music software. They let readers know that by using Linux based software they are assured of having a system that will improve, be updated as needed, and will always be free under the End User License Agreement. You can read the full article at this link: http://luisbg.users.ubuntustudio.org/luisbg/computer_music/ where the pages of the magazine have been posted. https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-studio-users/2008-September/003114.html

* Survey: 96 percent of enterprises not deploying Ubuntu server - Matt Asay from CNET News reports that Ubuntu server is only being deployed on 4% of the systems for a range of Fortune 1000 companies. Granted, with CIOs representing 48 percent of survey respondents, and vice presidents of IT representing another 33 percent, the survey was unlikely to get a very good view of grassroots IT adoption. However, on the other hand, Matt feels surprised that even 4% knew what Ubuntu was, and felt that this was progress. http://news.cnet.com/8301-13505_3-10037554-16.html

=== In The Blogosphere ===

* Ubuntu Saves Compaq Presario 2100 From Death and Windows - Joe Panettieri writes about saving his brother in law's Compaq Presario 2100 from being sent to the landfill.  Ronnie, his brother in law, was going to chuck the aging Windows machine.  He bought a new laptop, and Joe took the Presario and installed Ubuntu 8.04.  What Ronnie saw then cause him to ask some important questions concerning price and availability. Joe hopes users who are ready to pull the plug on their aging Windows systems will consider a new direction: Installing Ubuntu. http://www.workswithu.com/2008/09/10/ubuntu-saves-compaq-presario-2100-from-death-and-windows/

* Survey Says: Ubuntu Server Gaining Momentum - Joe Panettieri reports on a survey conducted by Works With U [1].  From voluntary information received from 1000 organizations and companies across the globe that run Ubuntu, they took the first 98 received and found the following information:
** 77.6 percent of participants indicated that they run Ubuntu on servers
** The typical survey participant has six Ubuntu servers and 15 Ubuntu desktops
** The most popular uses for Ubuntu servers include Web servers (57.1%), file servers (57.1%), databases (54.1%) and backup/recovery services (40.8%)
** Survey participants represent small, mid size and large organizations from across the globe
 It may not be a scientific survey, but it does show that Ubuntu is making inroads on the server market.

==== TurnKey Linux: new project builds Ubuntu based Live CD appliances ====

The motto of Turnkey Linux is "everything that can be easy, should be easy". Turn``Key is trying to make Ubuntu easier to use for certain types of (mostly server) tasks. Public Betas have been released for:
* Turn``Key LAMP stack
* Turn``Key Drupal 5
* Turn``Key Joomla
Some of the technical specifications of Turnkey are:
* Based on Ubuntu 8.04.1 (hardy LTS).
* Minimal footprint (typically around 150MB) - each appliance is
   carefully built from the ground up with the minimum components needed
   to serve its role with maximum efficiency and security.
* Packaged as an installable Live CD (I.E. bootable ISO) that can run
   on real hardware in addition to most types of virtual machines.

More information can be found at the website: http://www.turnkeylinux.org/

===== Status of cdrtools discussion =====

Mark has offered to obtain a legal opinion from the Software Freedom Law Center, on the condition that Joerg Schilling will agree up front to accept their determination.

We are waiting for Joerg to respond to this proposal.  Mark suggested that we also involve Sun in the discussion, as they are shipping cdrtools.

Action: Mark to contact Sun legal regarding cdrtools

===== Gobby co-maintenance with Debian =====

Philipp Kern, upstream developer and Debian maintainer of gobby, and MOTU, is interested in helping to maintain gobby in Ubuntu main.

We agreed that this is reasonable, and that Phillipp's existing qualifications are sufficient to grant upload privileges.

Action: Matt to arrange upload rights for gobby for pkern

===== Revisiting limited upload privileges for kernel and printing packages =====

The Technical Board granted core-dev privileges to two developers (Tim Gardner and Till Kamppeter) who are interested in working with specific packages in main, with the proviso that they were to follow standard sponsorship processes for other packages.

Now that Launchpad has the capability to implement this type of access control directly, we agreed to transition these developers from
ubuntu-core-dev to per-package upload rights.

Action: Matt to follow up with Tim and Till

===== Board membership/nominations =====

The Technical Board is in search of new members, and suggestions from the community have been received and reviewed. The next step is to contact the top candidates (most were suggested by third parties) and ask whether they are willing to serve in the position.

Action: Mark to contact the candidates and confirm their interest
