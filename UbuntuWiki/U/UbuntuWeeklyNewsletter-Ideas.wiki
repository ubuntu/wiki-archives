=== Ideas for UWN? ===

Do you have an idea for what might be included in the Ubuntu Weekly Newsletter?

Please edit this page with any ideas of what you want to see included in each issue. If you don't tell the team what you want to see then they won't be aware of what the thousands of UWN readers might want included either on a regular basis or from time to time.

* Insert your idea below
* Add the most recent episode(s) Portuguese Ubuntu Podcast (https://podcastubuntuportugal.org) to the Featured Audio & Video section (it's made by Portuguese LoCo Members)
-<Bashing-om> Done. The Portuguese Ubuntu Podcast is now an updated feature.

* more from the subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/Ubucon/
-<Bashing-om> We did have a reddit sponsor that did post for a short time that has since dropped out. Any new taker to post UWN to reddit ?
