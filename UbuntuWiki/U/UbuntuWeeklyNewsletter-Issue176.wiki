==== Ubuntu 10.4 Lucid Lynx Alpha 2 Released ====

Welcome to Lucid Lynx Alpha 2, which will in time become Ubuntu 10.04 LTS.

Pre-releases of Lucid are *not* encouraged for anyone needing a stable
system or anyone who is not comfortable running into occasional, even
frequent breakage.  They are, however, recommended for Ubuntu developers and
those who want to help in testing, reporting, and fixing bugs.

Alpha 2 is the second in a series of milestone CD images that will be
released throughout the Lucid development cycle.  The Alpha images are
known to be reasonably free of showstopper CD build or installer bugs, while
representing a very recent snapshot of Lucid. You can download it here:

* http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/lucid/alpha-2/ (Ubuntu)
* http://uec-images.ubuntu.com/releases/lucid/alpha-2/ (Ubuntu Server for UEC and EC2)
* http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ports/releases/lucid/alpha-2/ (Ubuntu ARM)
* http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/releases/lucid/alpha-2/ (Kubuntu)
* http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/xubuntu/releases/lucid/alpha-2/ (Xubuntu)
* http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/edubuntu/releases/lucid/alpha-2/ (Edubuntu)
* http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/mythbuntu/releases/lucid/alpha-2/ (Mythbuntu)

See http://wiki.ubuntu.com/Mirrors for a list of mirrors.

Alpha 2 includes a number of software updates that are ready for wider
testing.  Please refer to http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/lucid/alpha2 for
information on changes in Ubuntu.

This is quite an early set of images, so you should expect some bugs.  For a
list of known bugs (that you don't need to report if you encounter), please
see:

  http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/lucid/alpha2

If you're interested in following the changes as we further develop
Lucid, have a look at the lucid-changes mailing list:

  http://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/lucid-changes

We also suggest that you subscribe to the ubuntu-devel-announce list
if you're interested in following Ubuntu development. This is a
low-traffic list (a few posts a week) carrying announcements of
approved specifications, policy changes, alpha releases, and other
interesting events.

  http://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-devel-announce

Bug reports should go to the Ubuntu bug tracker:

  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ReportingBugs

==== Ubuntu Developer Week ====

Welcome to the Ubuntu Developer Week! We will have one week of action-packed sessions from Jan 25th 2010 to Jan 29th 2010!

Ubuntu Developer Week is a series of online workshops where you can:
* learn about different packaging techniques
* find out more about different development teams
* check out the efforts of the world-wide Development Community
* participate in open Q&A sessions with Ubuntu developers
* much more…
All sessions will happen on IRC, and the best way to join is to use Lernid[1]. (There are other ways[2] too.)

If you’re not comfortable yet asking all your questions in English, we will have a couple of people helping to translate your questions and translating back the answers. Have a look at the Ubuntu Developer Week page to see how it works.

Like the sound of it? DIGG IT![3]

==== Announcing Ubuntu User Day - January 23, 2010 ====

The Ubuntu User Days Team would like to announce the first Ubuntu User Day,
on January 23, 2010. This will be a very informative one day session geared
towards beginner and intermediate Ubuntu users, as well as people who are
interested in using Ubuntu. We have 14 classes covering topics ranging from
installing Ubuntu, finding help, equivalent programs, using IRC, getting
involved in the Ubuntu Community and more. We have enlisted the help of many
talented people to lead these classes throughout the day.

These classes will be taught in #ubuntu-classroom with questions being asked
in #ubuntu-classroom-chat on irc.freenode.net. Please visit
http://wiki.ubuntu.com/UserDays for a complete class list and schedule of
classes.

There is also a Spanish version of Ubuntu User Days being offered on
January, 23, 2010. Please visit Día Del Usuario Ubuntu at
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DiaDelUsuarioUbuntu for more information on the
Spanish Ubuntu User Day!

Please take a few minutes over the next week or so to promote the Ubuntu
User Day to people you know, in your Lo``Co Team, in your blog, or any other
resources you may have access to.

==== Kernel Bug Day - Tues 19 Jan, 2010 ====

This is a friendly reminder that we're starting up Kernel Bug Day's
again for the new year.  Don't know what a Kernel Bug Day is [1]?
This is the perfect opportunity to find out what it's all about.

The next Kernel Bug Day will be held Tues. 19 Jan, 2010 [2].  We'll be
focusing on bugs with a closed upstream bug watch.  These would be good
targets in Launchpad to overlook and possibly close as well.  Please
join us Tuesday in the #ubuntu-kernel IRC channel on Free``Node as
we tackle this list of bugs together

==== Ubuntu Server team: Amazon Web Services(AWS) client libraries feedback needed ====

The Ubuntu Server team is looking for feedback on which AWS client libraries should be made available as part of Ubuntu. Making it easy to develop applications that use AWS and  UEC services is one of the goal of the Ubuntu Server team. The AWS client libraries blueprint focuses on listing existing projects and then choose which ones should be packaged for Lucid.

If you know of great projects in PHP, Perl, Python, Ruby, Java (or any other platform)  that help using AWS and UEC services such as EC2 or S3 make a note of them in the wiki page.

==== Ubuntu Women Leadership Appointment Announcement ====

Speaking on behalf of the Community Council, Elizabeth Krumbach is happy to announce that they have selected Amber Graner for the 6 month leadership position in the Ubuntu Women project. Congratulations to Amber and a huge thanks to Melissa and Penelope for putting their names forward as candidates. We hope the goals and visions presented on all three of their wiki pages[0][1][2] can be incorporated moving forward and it was a delight to see the wealth of community support for all three of these fantastic candidates.

==== Plymouth In Ubuntu 10.04 Alpha 2: Dead Simple ====

Michael Larabel of Phoronix recalls that a month ago he wrote about Plymouth getting pulled into Ubuntu 10.04 LTS after Canonical ended up flip-flopping on their decision to use this Red Hat created splash program that leverages kernel mode-setting to provide a pleasant and flicker-free boot experience while being highly customizable and extensible. After the Plymouth packages got pulled into Ubuntu 10.04 LTS Phoronix also provided a video that showed it running on the "Lucid Lynx", but it was pretty boring with just a static Ubuntu logo and at the time some warning messages bled into the background. Ubuntu 10.04 Alpha 2 was this week and it featured Plymouth instead of U``Splash. The udev warning messages have since been cleared up, but the artwork remains the same. Included in the article is a photograph of this Plymouth plug-in as of today's Ubuntu Lucid packages, which will hopefully be enhanced by the artwork team before Ubuntu 10.04 LTS final is released in April. http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Nzg4MQ

==== Ubuntu 10.04 LTS "Lucid Lynx" Alpha 2 Released ====

Phoronix's Michael Larabel reports that on January 14, 2010 Canonical and the Ubuntu development community announced the release of Lucid Lynx Alpha 2, or more easily known as Ubuntu 10.04 LTS Alpha 2. This second alpha release of Ubuntu 10.04 delivers on Plymouth integration, the likewise-open package for Active Directory authentication has received a major upgrade, KDE 4.4 RC1, Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud improvements, and many other improvements to this popular Linux distribution. Details regarding Ubuntu 10.04 Alpha 2 can be found on the Ubuntu web-site. The Lucid blueprints on Launchpad provide additional information regarding the features expected for Ubuntu 10.04 LTS. Lastly, the mailing list announcement has links for the different distributions in the Ubuntu family that have been upgraded to a Lucid Lynx Alpha 2 status, such as Ubuntu ARM, Kubuntu, and Xubuntu. http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Nzg4Mw

==== Ubuntu 10.04 Alpha 2 Benchmarks With Early Fedora 13 Numbers ====

Michael Larabel of Phoronix tells us that with Ubuntu 10.04 Alpha 2 having been released, he couldn't resist but to run some new benchmarks of the Lucid Lynx after our original tests last month found Ubuntu 10.04 was off to a poor performance start. In some areas the performance of Ubuntu 10.04 LTS Alpha 2 remains lower than in Ubuntu 9.10 -- largely due to performance regressions upstream in the Linux kernel. Overall, there are both good and bad performance improvements for Ubuntu 10.04 LTS Alpha 2 in relation to Ubuntu 9.10. Most of the negative regressions are attributed to the EXT4 file-system losing some of its performance charm. http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=ubuntu_lucid_alpha2&num=1

==== Ubuntu 10.04 Alpha 2 Removes HAL ====

Linux Pro Magazine's Kristian Kissling notes that "HAL" unfortunately isn't the heinous supercomputer from Kubrick's film 2001, but Ubuntu's Hardware Abstraction Layer between Ubuntu's hardware and software. It has now disappeared entirely from the current Ubuntu 10.04 test version, and it's function being taken over among other things by Device``Kit. The advantage to this, according to the official announcement, is that Ubuntu has a faster boot and startup from hibernate time. Removing HAL has the consequence that Wacom drivers can no longer be used for drawing tablets. Follow this link for more information: http://www.linuxpromagazine.com/Online/News/Ubuntu-10.04-Alpha-2-Removes-HAL

=== In The Blogosphere ===

==== Five Essential Ubuntu Features by Christopher Tozzi ====

Christopher Tozzi, WorksWithU list five essential features that Ubuntu offers out-of-the-box that he has yet to see in any version of Windows.

1. Hardware autoconfiguration
2. Multiple desktops
3. Software repositories
4. ssh client
5. No antivirus

Tozzi states, "I’d like to emphasize again that I’m no Windows-hater. For some users, Windows makes more sense than Ubuntu." and he continues with, "...I can’t imagine myself living without Ubuntu (or a similar Linux distribution, since the features listed above are not unique to Ubuntu itself) ever again..." http://www.workswithu.com/2010/01/14/five-essential-ubuntu-features/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+WorksWithU+(Works+With+U)

==== Tegra 2 supports Ubuntu Linux ====

Interested in touchscreen technology?  See what soltesza has to save about the Ubuntu Linux supported Nvidia devices. "According to this faq-like post on the official Nvidia Tegra developer site, Ubuntu Linux is supported as an operating system for Tegra 2 based devices. "This is extremely important for both Nvidia and Linux in general since a lot of IT-savvy people find Android insufficient for the netbook form factor and ask for a “real” Linux on these very promising devices. A simple Gnome desktop or Ubuntu’s Netbook Remix user interface may not be perfect for a touchscreen operated tablet but is very useable with the traditional laptop form factor. Some of the Tegra 2 tablets will add a pointer device as well, in addition to the touchscreen (like the Notion Ink Adam) so these machines will be easy to use with a customized, full Linux desktop." http://soltesza.wordpress.com/2010/01/11/tegra-2-supports-ubuntu-linux/

==== Ubuntu v. Macintosh and Windows ====

Don Watkins, on his blog - Country Contemplative, compares and contrasts Ubuntu, Macintosh, and Windows.  Watkins states that, "it [Macintosh] is Linux with great multi-media...I love Photo Booth, iPhoto, iMovie and iDVD all great software products that work together rather seamlessly. But are they worth double the price of a Dell for the average person." Watkins has this to say about Windows, "I think Microsoft has gotten the bugs out of Vista in Windows 7. So far it’s quite easy to operate and doesn’t have all the “yes/no” permission questions of Vista. I got Windows 7 Premium because I wanted to experiment with their multimedia tools too."  And with regards to Ubuntu, Watkins notes the plus side for him, "with Ubuntu and Linux in general and this is where Linux really kicks both Windows and the Mac is you have the same OS whether mainframe, desktop, laptop or mobile device and it’s just plain stable. "  Watkins makes some interesting predictions on what he sees as the future for Ubuntu, Macintosh and Windows.  Take a look and see if you think he's got it. http://countrycontemplative.wordpress.com/2010/01/10/1963/

==== Canonical, IBM: Ubuntu Will Counter Windows 7 At Lotusphere ====

The VAR Guy, gives the scoop on Canonicals effort to counter Microsoft's Windows 7 push at IBM's Lotusphere conference in Orlando next week. Sounds interesting, "IBM has previously stated Smart Work can save customers up to 50 percent per seat on software costs vs. traditional Microsoft-based desktops. Canonical says the solution includes Ubuntu 8.04 LTS Desktop Edition and Lotus Symphony, which includes word processing, spreadsheets, and presentations, fully supported by Canonical at $5.50 per user, per month based on 1000 seat deployment."
The VAR Guy states that it is important to keep this upcoming push in perspective as well, "The company’s channel remains a work in progress, and the next three months will rank among the most critical in Canonical’s history — due to the forthcoming Ubuntu 10.04 (Lucid Lynx) release in April 2010 and the ongoing CEO transition, which should be completed by March 2010." http://www.thevarguy.com/2010/01/14/canonical-ibm-ubuntu-will-counter-windows-7-at-lotusphere/
