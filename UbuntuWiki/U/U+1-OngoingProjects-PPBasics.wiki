Once you have installed or upgraded to Ubuntu 12.04, you are going to want to get on the Internet to download updates and to use the Web browser to find more information. Just follow the steps below. The screenshot above will tell you the names of the components of the Unity interface.

=== Get on the Internet and update software ===

To get online and use Firefox, just...

* The '''Network Manager''' icon is in the usual place on the top right of the screen. The top panel is now called the 'menu bar'.
* Click on the Network manager icon in the usual way and select the WiFi network you want to use, or Wired if you have a wired connection
* If the WiFi network uses encryption, you will be prompted for the pass phrase details in the usual way
* The bar on  the left of the screen is the '''Launcher Bar''': click on the firefox icon to start Firefox
* You are surfing!
* Look at the Firefox icon in the Launcher. It has a small white triangle to the left of the icon. That shows you have a Firefox window running. You can switch between running applications by clicking on their Launcher icons
* Where is the Firefox menu? It is hidden in the Menu Bar at the top of the screen. With Firefox as the active application, mouse over the menu bar to see the menu
* The Firefox menu can also be revealed and navigated by pressing F10, which brings up the File menu, and by using the arrow keys to move along the menu bar.

To check for software updates and to shutdown or restart the computer, just

* Check the indicators on the right of the menu bar. '''Software Updates''' will appear if there are automatic updates
* Click on the 'cog wheel' menu to manually start the '''Software Updater'''
* The usual '''Terminal''' commands (apt-get/aptitude) work exactly as before
* '''Synaptic has been replaced''' by default with the '''Ubuntu Software Centre''', but Synaptic can still be installed.
* You can '''shut down the computer''' via the 'cog wheel' icon - see the graphic above
* The '''Restart''' option appears ''after'' you select '''Shutdown...''' from the menu

=== Use the Dash instead of the Applications Menu ===

To start applications that are not in the Launcher, you use the Dash.

The Dash replaces and ''considerably'' extends the old Application Menu. The Dash includes a dynamic search function for applications (by title and by function) and for files.

To see the Dash in action, suppose you want to find and load Gedit, the Gnome text editor.

* Click the Dash icon or 'tap' the Super key
* A 'tap' is simply pressing the key, then releasing it again straight away
* The Home lens will appear, with a box to type into
* In the Search Box type Gedit
* You will probably get as far as Ge when you see the Gedit icon
* When the Gedit icon is the first icon listed, you can load it by pressing the Enter key, or by clicking once with the mouse
* When Gedit loads, the Gedit window will become the active window. The Gedit menu will be hidden in the menu bar at the top of the screen. Mouse over the menu bar to see the menu, or use the F10 keyboard shortcut along with the arrow keys.

The Home lens overlay shows your most recently used applications in the first row, and your most recently used files in the second row. In Unity, you can reach most of your current work with a few mouse clicks or with a bit of typing. You can navigate in the Home Lens using the keyboard arrows as well as the mouse.

There are four other lenses, see the icons at the bottom of the Home lens. You have an Application lens, a document lens, a music lens and a video lens. Unity provides a really simple way of organising your files and media.

=== Load the Ubuntu Desktop Guide ===

The Ubuntu Desktop Guide (the 'help' application) is installed with Ubuntu 12.04 and provides more detailed help with the Unity interface and with the new default applications.  To start the Ubuntu Desktop Guide, just

* Tap the Super key or click on the Dash icon
* Type 'help' into the Home lens search box
* When the blue Help application icon appears press the Enter key or click on the icon

The Ubuntu Desktop Guide is fully searchable
