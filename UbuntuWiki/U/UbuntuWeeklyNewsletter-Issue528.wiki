==== Introducing the 1.8 freedesktop runtime in the gnome nightly builds ====

Alexander Larsson reminds us that the current Flakpak runtimes are based on 1.6, which is composed of two layers, one built using Yocto and the other using flatpak-builder. He tell us that, since Yocto wasn't a great fit, work has been done to provide a Yocto-free 1.8 runtime, which is now available in an unstable form. Alexander calls for testing and to report any found issues.
