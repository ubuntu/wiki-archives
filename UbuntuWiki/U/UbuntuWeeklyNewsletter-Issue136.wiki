==== Newly Approved Ubuntu LoCo Teams ====

On Tuesday, March 31st the Ubuntu Lo``Co Council met to consider team applications. The results are as follows:

* Ubuntu Russia: The Russian Team got outstanding team support during the meeting from its members, and the Council noticed. The also noticed all the great work the Russian Team has done. A suggestion was made that the team should host more events in the future, but it was easy to see that this team is off to a great start. Application: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RussianTeam/ApprovalApplication Team Wiki: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RussianTeam

* Ubuntu Malaysia: The Malaysian Team showed strong community work through support, events and advocacy. They have 164 registered members and have worked to help the government in its adoption of FOSS. They also are working on building a local language wiki. Application: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MalaysianTeam/ApprovalApplication Team Wiki: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MalaysianTeam

The Lo``Co Council and the Ubuntu Community congratulate these newly approved Ubuntu Lo``Co Teams.

==== Hug Day: April 9th ====

Time to get involved in making Ubuntu even better by participating in Hug Day!

* Date: April 9, 2009
* Target: Bugs with Patches
* Location: IRC channel #ubuntu-bugs
* Wiki page: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBugDay/20090409
* Information: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/HelpingWithBugs/

Get involved in helping to squash those pesky bugs!

==== Ubuntu Brainstorm: Call for Idea Reviewers ====

After observing the current trends and workload, the QA Team felt that there was a need for more idea reviewers. Therefore, they are looking for Brainstorm users who would be willing to volunteer for doing the reviews.

Who are Idea Reviewers? Brainstorm idea reviewers' group is a part of the Ubuntu Brainstorm Moderator[1] team. They are responsible for performing an initial screening of ideas inside the Idea Sandbox[2] before they are sent to the Popular Ideas[3] section. Idea Reviewers participate in all activities on the team mailing list[4] and at our IRC channel #ubuntu-brainstorm (freenode).

1. https://launchpad.net/~brainstorm-moderators
2. http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/ideas_in_preparation/
3. http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/latest_ideas/
4. https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/brainstorm-moderators

What can you do as a reviewer? Mainly, you would need to check whether an idea follows the posting guidelines, that it isn't a bug or a packaging request, and that it hasn't been posted before. You would be having a number of moderator tools to help you with the job. You can find more guidelines at the wiki page. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Brainstorm/BrainstormModerators#Approving%20ideas%20in%20the%20Idea%20Sandbox

How can you apply for joining the team? Drop in a mail at our mailing list: brainstorm-moderators [AT] lists.ubuntu.com Make sure you include your Brainstorm user name so that the QA Team can take a quick look at your activity so far. The team would be mainly looking for users who know how brainstorm works, and how things are done (you can always choose to have a mentor who can help you with everything). Once the team is happy, you will be assimilated. "Resistance is futile."

==== The Fourth Horseman ====

Ladies and Gents, I am tickled pink to announce the latest horseman to join my team at Canonical. His name is David Planella and he will be our new Ubuntu Translations Coordinator. He will join Daniel Holbach and Jorge Castro on the team.

David has a strong background in translations and development. He is an Ubuntu Catalan Team administrator and translator, a GNOME translator, Debian translator and had performed translation and coordination of several other projects through Softcatalà, a non-profit volunteer organization for the promotion of the Catalan language in IT, and the other technologies. Oh, and for kicks he is a core developer on the Linux acx100 wireless driver. Rock and roll!

David joins the crew on the 6th April and our friends in the translations community will be seeing David more and more. Folks, give him a warm welcome!

=== Launchpad News ===

==== Launchpad 2.2.3 Released: multiple PPAs and translation imports from Bazaar ====

The Launchpad team is proud to announce the release of Launchpad 2.2.3!

Here are the highlights of what’s new in this release:

* Additional Personal Package Archives for yourself and your teams
* Translation template imports directly from your project’s Bazaar branches

Additional Personal Package Archives: You can now create multiple PPAs both for yourself and your teams. This is ideal if you’re publishing different versions of the same application to different audiences. For example: you may have one archive for alpha versions and another that’s used by your beta testers. Visit your profile page — or that of one of your teams — to add more PPAs. See Julian’s blog post for further details. http://blog.launchpad.net/?p=658

Translation template imports from Bazaar branches: Host your project’s code using Launchpad and Bazaar? Also translate your software using Launchpad? Launchpad can now automatically find and import your translation templates from your project’s Bazaar branches. Once you’ve activated automatic imports, Launchpad will monitor the official branch for each of your series and pull in any new template versions that you commit. Read Henning’s blog post to get the full story. http://blog.launchpad.net/?p=639

There’s more to Launchpad 2.2.3, including:

* teams can now have +junk branches
* releases are now directly linked to milestones http://blog.launchpad.net/?p=627
* project owners and bug supervisors can now set official bug tags
* uploading packages to Launchpad, whether directly for Ubuntu or to a PPA, now earns you karma!

For full details of the bugs and blueprints that make up Launchpad 2.2.3 visit its milestone page. https://launchpad.net/launchpad-project/+milestone/2.2.3

If you come across a bug, please report it! https://bugs.launchpad.net/launchpad

==== Launchpad: Official Bug Tags ====

In the latest release of the Launchpad bug tracker, the Launchpad Team has introduced a new feature: official bug tags. Tags blessed by the project team as official display using a darker colour on the bug page, and are placed prominently at the top of the tags list on project pages. Users can still add tags that are not endorsed by the project as official, but they are encouraged to use official tags where possible.

Tags are a great way to group bugs together, and their free-form nature allows all users participating in bug tracking to invent new and interesting ways to categorize bugs. Visit the link below to learn more about the Launchpad Teams new way of tagging bugs.

==== Ubuntu Server offers Amazon Cloud Capabilities ====

The next iteration of Ubuntu Linux will really help companies lift up into the clouds. The April 30 release of Ubuntu Server will have the ability to migrate KVM-based virtual machines from one physical server to another, similar to VMware's ability to use VMotion to migrate virtual machines, said Steve George, director of the enterprise group at Linux supplier Canonical. In addition, Canonical is adding clustering software that will manage a set of x86 Ubuntu servers as if they were a combined cloud resource. The development team wants Ubuntu Server users to be able to put Ubuntu on a set of x86 servers and then build inside the company an Amazon-compatible cloud.

http://www.informationweek.com/news/software/linux/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=216402773&cid=RSSfeed_IWK_ALL

==== Ubuntu Server's Ambitions no longer cloudy ====

A big feature for 9.04 is cloud compatibility, in the form of a) being able to run instances of 9.04 directly on Amazon EC2 clouds and b) being able to provision cloud-computing infrastructures with local servers (Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud). There's a whole raft of other goodies, too, most of them built around making servers that much easier to provision and manage, but the cloud features made Serdar Yegulalp sit up and pay attention. According to Serdar, "I don't know of a single harried administrator who wouldn't want to be able to, say, provision twenty servers without having to manually pull the levers on each one." If Canonical can make this into the draw for Ubuntu Server, they'll be able to carve out that much more of a niche for themselves.

http://www.informationweek.com/blog/main/archives/2009/04/ubuntu_servers.html

==== The latest Ubuntu 9.04 Beta comes with improved netbook support ====

It Runs On Linux reports that the popular Linux distribution Ubuntu has released a beta of it's latest version, 9.04. This Beta is reported to be running fine on several Netbooks. Brad Linder from Liliputing loaded it onto a 1GB USB flash drive using UNetbootin & did test it on his Eee PC 1000HE & noticed "all of the hardware just worked". Even the keyboard shortcuts for adjusting the volume and screen brightness worked fine on his Eee PC 1000HE. Ubuntu Mini reports: "The Beta does not require any extra fixes or patches for the Dell Mini 9. Audio works out of the box and there is no longer a drive mounting problem after a LiveUSB install. Installing Ubuntu Netbook Remix doesn't require adding any extra repositories or adding items to your start-up programs." http://eeepc.itrunsonlinux.com/the-news/290-the-latest-ubuntu-904-beta-comes-with-improved-netbook-support

==== Ubuntu 9.04 Beta vs. Fedora 11 Beta Performance ====

Michael Larabel or phoronix tells us that last week marked the release of the Ubuntu 9.04 Beta and this week there is the planned release of the Fedora 11 Beta. Both distributions are similar in the respect they will be upgrading several common packages like GNOME 2.26, but in Fedora 11 there are more upstream (and experimental) bits like kernel mode-setting, the EXT4 file-system by default, and various other features. phoronix set out to run a few performance tests comparing the Ubuntu 9.04 Beta to the latest Rawhide packages that will make up today's Fedora 11 Beta release. Of the 15 tests, the Ubuntu 9.04 Beta won 10 of these Linux tests -- in a few of the tests though, the performance was close. This is a bit surprising considering Fedora 11 Beta uses the newer Linux 2.6.29 kernel and the phoronix internal benchmarks have shown this kernel to perform better overall than its predecessor. http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=ubuntu_fedora_q209&num=1

==== Moblin V2 vs. Ubuntu Netbook Remix vs. Ubuntu MID ====

Last week Intel pushed out a second alpha release of Moblin V2. Moblin is certainly turning into an interesting Intel creation, but how does its performance compare to other mobile-focused Linux distributions? phoronix benchmarked Moblin V2 Alpha 2, and compared it against what is likely their biggest competitor in the mobile space, Ubuntu Netbook Remix, and the LPIA-based Ubuntu MID edition. Which of these mobile operating systems is the fastest? The LPIA-based Ubuntu MID was the fastest in three of the seven tests, while Ubuntu Netbook Remix was the fastest in three of the others. When it came to SQLite where there is the bug phoronix exposed in the 2.6.26 - 2.6.28 kernels, Moblin V2 came out ahead. However, in some of these tests, the results between the three distributions were very close. http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=moblin_ubuntu_mobile&num=1

==== Xubuntu 9.0.4 ScreenShots Beta ====

For those that enjoy seeing how a new distribution looks, Allen Sanabria of Linux Dynasty has released his second set of screen shorts and this time it is Xubuntu 9.0.4 Beta based on the New Jaunty Jackalope Beta Release of Ubuntu 9.0.4. Allen says, "I absolutely love Xubuntu since it uses the very light and efficient Xfce 4.6. Granted usually I am praising the fancier Ubuntu based distros, but I do love the simpleness and the fast loading of Applications in Xubuntu." http://www.linuxdynasty.org/xubuntu-904-screenshots-beta.html

==== Ubuntu server adoption slow but steady in the data center ====

Pam Derringer of Search``Data``Center says that although the Ubuntu desktop has won wide popularity, Ubuntu's fairly sophisticated server OS has yet to establish significant inroads in U.S. data centers. In a recent Ubuntu global user survey, nearly a third of the respondents worked for companies with 10 or fewer employees and only 28% worked in the U.S. And the overwhelming majority are using it for basic functions like Web, print and file, database and backup servers, with only a small minority using it for advanced tasks like virtualization or cluster computing. The most prevalent Ubuntu industry sectors, unsurprisingly, were technology and education. Most of the respondents said they are entrusting mission critical functions to Ubuntu and will be adding more Ubuntu servers in the future. http://searchdatacenter.techtarget.com/news/article/0,289142,sid80_gci1352654,00.html

==== Shuttleworth: Windows 7 an Opportunity for Linux ====

Sean Michael Kerner of Internet``News.com reports that Microsoft might be betting big on Windows 7, but to Ubuntu Linux founder Mark Shuttleworth, the upcoming release is really an opportunity for Linux to shine. Granted, Linux on the desktop has not made as much of a dent against Windows as it has in the datacenter. But Shuttleworth figures the desktop itself and the applications that people are using are changing in ways that make the coming desktop battle different than it has ever been before. "The principals of diversity in the desktop space are well established," Shuttleworth told Internet``News.com. "The benefits to consumers and industry of having an alternative are very substantial. Any change in the status quo is an opportunity." http://www.internetnews.com/mobility/article.php/3813456/Shuttleworth+Windows+7+Is+an+Opportunity+for+Linux.htm

=== In The Blogosphere ===

==== Upgrading to Ubuntu 9.04 Beta ====

Tom of Tombuntu reports that on March 26 Ubuntu 9.04 Beta was released. He installed it on his main desktop system as soon as it was available, and has been running it for a few days. Tom reports many improvements in the Jaunty beta that he likes such as the Transmission Bittorrent client’s interface has been tweaked in a few places so it’s now easier to select which individual files to download and set their priority. Also, the default version of Compiz now recognizes GIMP’s toolbox windows and keeps them floated above the image window like Metacity. If you’ve tried the beta, how’s it been for you? Any new features in particular you like? http://tombuntu.com/index.php/2009/03/30/upgrading-to-ubuntu-904-beta/

==== Managed Service Providers Embrace Ubuntu Server Edition ====

Blogger Joe Panettieri from Works With U gives us the scoop about Ubuntu Server Edition's suprise appearance at the Autotask Community Live conference. He found 2 companies that are building their business on top of Ubuntu Server Edition. These companies are Rezitech and Network Depot. Rezietech has Ubuntu sitting at the foundation of their data center. On top of that, they run virtualized Windows services such as: Kayseya, Active Directory and VoIP. This took Joe Panettieri completely by surprise. Network Depot on the other hand, is using Ubuntu Server Edition for its Network Attached Storage or NAS platform. They will Use Ubuntu in conjunction with Kaseya BUDR services as a centralized, low cost, easy to manage NAS device. The platform will be based upon the Shuttle K45 platform allowing Network Depot to create a 1TB ethernet NAS solution that is anticipated to cost under $350. He finishes off by saying that, "during the Autotask conference we didn't go looking for Ubuntu news. But it definitely found us." http://www.workswithu.com/2009/04/02/managed-service-providers-embrace-ubuntu-server-edition/

==== Best of the Best: Hive Five Winners, January through March 2009 ====

Blogger Jason Fitzpatrick from lifehacker goes over the Hive Five winners through January and March of 2009. This is based on polls that were on lifehacker.com between January and March this year. Through these polls Ubuntu won twice in the categories of "Best Home Server Software," and "Best Linux Distribution." Jason Fitzpatrick gives a general description of who the winner is and what it does. http://lifehacker.com/5194859/best-of-the-best-hive-five-winners-january-through-march-2009

==== New Ubuntu Linux server is for business ====

Blogger Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols from Computerworld discusses the new release of Ubuntu Server Edition, and what that will bring. He first covers the improved virtualization with the new version of Kernel-based Virtual machine or KVM, and it's easier integration with Microsoft Active Directory (AD). This will be made possible with the incorporation of Likewise Open and Samba 3.3 support. With the better virtualization the server will be available to users on Amazon's EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud). He also lets us know that users can not only join the Amazon cloud, but also create their own EC-2 cloud on their servers. As far as Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols knows, this is the first operating system to support cloud computing out of the box. Ubuntu Server Edition will also include Advanced Message Queuing Protocol or AMQP support. AMQP is an important set of middleware and SOA (service-oriented architecture) protocols. Red Hat is the only other Linux distribution to support it till now. Baughan-Nichols doesn't know if Ubuntu is ready to go head to head with Red Hat this year, but he does say that, "that's exactly what Canonical is planning to do by next year." http://blogs.computerworld.com/new_ubuntu_linux_server_is_for_business

==== Will Your Next Wireless Router Run Ubuntu? ====

Blogger Christopher Tozzi from Works With U discusses some of the wireless development in Ubuntu, that hasn't been discussed as much as other topics. Although Ubuntu’s rather conservative approach to the new wireless stack leaves many users still having to install drivers manually in Intrepid, the era is at least on the horizon when wireless networking will work out-of-the-box for everyone. He then moves on to talk about "Master Mode" which is a new feature that has the ability to turn an Ubuntu computer into a wireless router. Right now it requires familiarity with commands like iwconfig and the hostap utility, thus limiting it to experienced Linux Geeks. Christopher Tozzi looks forward to the day when users will be able to take advantage of this functionality with a push of a button in network manager. http://www.workswithu.com/2009/04/02/will-your-next-wireless-router-run-ubuntu/

==== Ubuntu-UK Podcast: The Return ====

Ciemon Dunville, Alan Pope, Tony Whitmore, Dave Walker and Producer Laura Cowen bring you a new episode of the Ubuntu Podcast from the UK Local Community Support Team.

In this the first episode of the second season the Ubuntu UK podcast team returns with a slightly changed format. They’re trying to reduce their workload by recording more ‘live’ and doing less editing and post processing. They're’re hoping this won’t reduce the quality that you’ve come to know and love in their little podcast.

=== Meeting Summaries ===

==== Ubuntu Server Team Meeting: March 31st ====

Minutes of the meeting. They can also be found online with the irc logs here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MeetingLogs/Server/20090331

* Ubuntu Server Guide: sommer reported that he received some feedback on a few sections from the Ubuntu Server Guide. However some sections still need to be reviewed: they’re listed in the wiki page. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/JauntyServerGuide Help in reviewing them is welcomed.

* NUMA support for 64bit -server kernel: cooloney brought up the question of whether NUMA should be enabled on 64bit -server kernel. No objections were raised except that it may be too late for the Jaunty release cycle. This topic should be discussed for the Karmic cycle at the next UDS with the Kernel team.

* Ubuntu on EC2: zul gave a report on the state of Ubuntu on EC2. The next beta image based on Intrepid is being worked on. Next in the pipeline is an image based on Hardy and the 2.6.24 kernel. An image based on Jaunty and the 2.6.28 kernel is also being planned. Each new release will be announced on the ec2-beta mailing list. https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ec2-beta

* Bugs from Jaunty Beta: mathiaz reminded that with the release of Jaunty Beta last Thursday the number of new bugs filed had raised. Any help in triaging them is welcomed. The list of new bugs related to the Ubuntu Server team is a good place to start any triaging effort. http://ubuntuservernewbugs.notlong.com/

* Bacula testing: ivoks asked for more testing and bug triaging on the bacula package. https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/bacula/

* RHCS support: ivoks raised the question of whether Red Hat Cluster Suite should be kept in main in Karmic. Fabio M. Di Nitto, the current maintainer, mentioned he had less and less time to maintain the package and was looking for some help. mathiaz suggested to discuss this topic at the next UDS. Meanwhile ivoks will make sure rhcs is in good shape for Jaunty.

* Agree on next meeting date and time: Next meeting will be on Tuesday, April 7th at 15:00 UTC in #ubuntu-meeting.
