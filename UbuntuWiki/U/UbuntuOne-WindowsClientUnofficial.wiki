__TOC__

'''Note:''' This is not an official part of UbuntuOne. Any information about this project should not be requested from the U1 team.

UbuntuOne has been an integral part of Ubuntu since 9.10. It's time to take it to different platforms, allowing for access to your precious files, bookmarks, contacts and whatnot on other platforms.

This page is intended for various blueprints and ideas for how this could be incorporated into Windows, as the plans for creating such a client officially is way in the future.

If you have any ideas, please add them below in the shape of a bullet list ( * Hello!) and sign it.

Design mockups are welcome!
