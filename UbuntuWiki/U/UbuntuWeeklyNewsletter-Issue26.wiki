==== Ben Collins Interviewed ====

<nowiki>[[http://behindubuntu.org/|Behind Ubuntu]]</nowiki> had its latest interview is with our very own illustrious kernel Hacker, Ben Collins.

Ben is one of Ubuntu's premier kernel hackers. Currently employed by Canonical, Ben has been focusing on improving hardware support and stability. Ben's claim to fame is that he does all of his work out of a barn. His systems are secured using a 110 volt Stockmaster energized electric fence and a one tonne bull. When asked "How much time do you spend working on Ubuntu?", he answers: "I try not to keep count. Way more than I should." How much time do *you* spend on Ubuntu?

==== Changes at the UWN ====

There have been some interesting developments at the UWN recently. 

* The UWN is proud to announce that Cody A.W. Somerville (somerville32) has been appointed the new Co-Chief Editor of the Ubuntu Weekly Newsletter.
* Several translation efforts have been started to provide the UWN in native languages. See the frontpage of the UWN (http://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuWeeklyNewsletter) for more details.
* A script has been developed by Cody Somerville to help make the Feisty Changes section easier to write. In the past, it has taken 3-4 writers up to seven consecutive hours to bring you the Feisty Changes section. Hopefully the new script will make the process easier so that we can get the UWN to you on a more regular basis. The script will be tested for the first time for UWN Issue #27

=== LoCo News ===

==== Interview on people Behind Ubuntu-ph ====

The first interview for "People Behind Ubuntu-PH", the LoCo Team of Ubuntu Philippines, was conducted by Mrs. Yolynne Medina via email. She is one of the active members of Ubuntu-PH. The first person interviewed is Mr. Jerome Gotangco, initiator of Ubuntu-PH.

Read more about the interview: http://ubuntu-ph.org/node/78

==== Ubuntu-ve at Expotecnologica ====

This week the Venezuela LoCo team had very productive week at the Expotecnologica held at the convention isle of a very famous shopping mall in the city of Maracaibo, Venezuela. The invitation came rather late, so preparations for the event were not very many. The event gathered the latest trends in technology. Representatives from companies like Nintendo, Epson and A2 Softway (software development group) offered services, and the different university projects gave the event a very special touch of local talent.

=== Changes In Feisty ===

Changes in Feisty has been deferred for this issue. Please check back next week!

=== Launchpad News ===

==== Bug Notification Issue ====

Over the Christmas break, Launchpad stopped sending bug notification
emails - a service important to many developers as it helps them keep track of bugs related to them on Launchpad. Matthew Revell had the following to say in an email:

 "I'm sorry for the inconvenience that this has caused you. We've found the bug responsible and will have the fix rolled out by Thursday (4th Jan).

 We have pretty good quality control but obviously it wasn't thorough enough for us to catch this bug before the Christmas holiday. We're now reviewing how we test changes to Launchpad and will implement a new QA process for the bug mail system.

 I'm glad to say that no data was lost. You may not receive notification of all bug changes straight away, though, as we are currently looking at the best way to process the backlog."

For more information about Launchpad, please visit http://launchpad.net or visit #launchpad on irc.freenode.net

==== Rosetta Statistics ====

Changes in Rosetta from Sept 3rd to December 31st:

* Templates:   +161   (4341 -> 4502)
* Strings:     +34916 (697429 -> 732345)
* PO Files:    +10388 (140753 -> 151141)
* Languages:   +6     (223 -> 229)
* Translators: +3352  (14753  -> 18105)

=== In The Press ===

==== Ubuntu vs SUSE vs Fedora ====

Ubuntu was compared against these two distributions, and although all three had "good and bad", in the end, Ubuntu won the editor's heart. Ubuntu's strong desktop focus and simple installer tipped the scale in our favor ;). The notable complaints were the lack of an active firewall by default and no clear, easy way to get one installed.

You can read the complete shootout at: http://www.helpero.com/news/Computers/Linux/UBUNTU-vs-SUSE-vs-FEDORA_20.html

==== How One Small Business Switched to Ubuntu ====

The Inquirer ran a story on how one small business switched its servers successfully to Ubuntu after becoming frustrated with its current setup. Check it out: http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=36635

==== Mark Shuttleworth on out-innovating Apple and Microsoft ====

Red Herring, a technology business magazine, interviewed Mark Shuttleworth about recent developments in the world of open source and his plans for Ubuntu.

A nice highlight from the interview is:

   "Q:  What about growth in adoption rates, any kind of numbers that you can give me?
    A:  We know now that there are probably at least 8 million [Ubuntu] users."

Who knew there are 8 million of us?

==== Windows and Ubuntu on One PC ====

PCWorld has a nice article on how easy it is to have Windows and Ubuntu installed on the same PC. It has some good caveats for interoperability issues between the two OSes.

Spread the word: http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,128136-c,linux/article.html

==== Yo' Mamma likes Ubuntu ====

Like most parents these days who buy a computer at Best Buy or Wal-Mart and then take it home, plug it in and start using the Web, the computer they bought usually has Windows pre-installed. After a couple months, using the computer deteriorates into a sluggish experience. One particular mother loves Ubuntu after her son installed it on her new laptop.

=== Community Spotlight ===

This week we will be taking a look at the Ubuntu Marketing Team (the people who make an enormous effort every week to bring you what has been happening in the Ubuntu world). The Marketing Team is focused on promoting Ubuntu's uptake in various ways, essentially looking for ways to make people aware of Ubuntu and what it offers.

Ubuntu Bug #1 (http://launchpad.net/malone/bugs/1) is our inspiration, and its final bugfix is our final goal. Spreading all Free Software, particularly Ubuntu, is in the interest of the Team.

The scope of the Marketing Team is:

* Provide a unified front to enable the proliferation of the Ubuntu distribution, inclusive of all marketing activities
* Creatively advocate and positively promote the Ubuntu distribution on behalf of the Ubuntu community
* Understand and respond to the requirements of individuals interested in migrating to the Ubuntu distribution, making it easier for others to do so
* Understand the need to find zero-cost and cost-effective awareness strategies that allow for unlimited scalability
* Provide resources that enable positive and accurate press coverage with a long reach
* Develop long-standing stakeholder relationships that encourage open dialogue and deeper understanding
* Remain approachable by all members of the general public regardless of technical ability
* Remain an 'open' team, understanding that a perfect marketing team recognises that all users are potential advocates
* Be prepared to change and mould to the waves of market forces whilst remaining resolute in our founding principles
* Respect and incorporate the views of the FOSS and Ubuntu community, Canonical Ltd and all users
* Ensure professionalism and Quality of Service at all times 
 
The main projects the Marketing Team is currently working on are:

* The Fridge  (A community-driven news website. You can find it at: http://fridge.ubuntu.com/)
* Ubuntu Weekly News (Weekly news for the community about the community)
* Case Studies (gathering Ubuntu use cases, http://www.ubuntu.com/mystory)
* Herd Reports (updates in the current development version of Ubuntu)
* Ubuntu Video (Portal showcasing Ubuntu videos, take a peek at: http://www.ubuntuvideo.com/)
* Marketing Surveys (surveys on the needs of current, potential and previous users, see current ones at: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MarketingTeam/UbuntuSurveys)
* Spread Ubuntu (a website providing resources for grassroots advocacy, work in progress)
* DIY Website (gathering place for DIY Marketing materials, homegrown campaigns and DIY howtos, work in progress) 
 
Interested in helping out? Joining is easy!

The marketing team is always looking for people to help out. We have huge plans to bring the wonder of Ubuntu to the world, and the more people helping do that the faster we progress.

* Read through the pages linked to from the MarketingTeam page to get an idea of what we are currently working on.
* Join the mailing list. You can have a read through the archives to catch up on what has been discussed previously - but this isn't necessary as important points will be put into the wiki.
* Much of the team's communication and project coordination take place in our IRC channel: #ubuntu-marketing on irc.freenode.net
* Once you've made up your mind, join the team in Launchpad.
