==== Call for testing: Yaru GTK4 theme ====

Paul K. tells us the pull request that adds GTK4 support to Yaru has been merged, and some help is needed to test it. With some details (and link) to help test, we're told to report all issues found via Git``hub.

https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/call-for-testing-yaru-gtk4-theme/20668

==== Private home directories for Ubuntu 21.04 ====

Alex Murray writes that Ubuntu has evolved from it's early days; being seen mostly in the cloud or on devices today, where "strong security is paramount". We are given a brief summary of unix permissions, and told the reasons for the original decisions on security being formed around family members sharing a computer, which seems "quaint" today. Alex highlights that new installs from Ubuntu 21.04 on, will have private home directories. Telling us of the change, and how it may impact some use-cases, we are provided with a work-around that will resolve issues. We are also given the commands that will change an existing installation to make it equivalent to new installs, as well as how to disable it if we're installing Ubuntu 21.04.

https://ubuntu.com//blog/private-home-directories-for-ubuntu-21-04

==== Getting started with Flutter on Ubuntu ====

Daniel Llewellyn starts with a brief discussion about an upcoming new Ubuntu desktop installer, which will use flutter. To help himself learn, Daniel decided to install and sample Flutter on Ubuntu.  This article outlins some discovered "gotchas", and a summary of how to get the "fully functional toolchain setup" for yourself, then testing it using a sample Flutter app.

https://diddledan.com/2021/02/getting-started-with-flutter-on-ubuntu/

==== Linux sudo exploit gives root access ====

Casey Tonkin reminds us that Qualys researchers have found a buffer overflow vulnerability that allows ordinary users to gain root privileges. The good news is Qualys disclosed the vulnerability responsibly allowing for the patches needed for fix to be created, and distributed before the announcement was made.

=== In the Blogosphere ===

==== Ubuntu is Working on a Brand New Installer ====

Joey Sneddon tells us that the Canonical Design & Desktop teams are creating a new installer for Ubuntu desktop. “The tool will use Flutter, leverage Curtin, and take advantage of the effort put into Subiquity". We are reminded of ubiquity's age, and given some reasons why they have chosen not to use an existing installer, quoting Canonical's Martin Wimpress. We should see the new installer for Ubuntu 21.10, but a Git``Hub link is provided for those wanting to peek.

==== Martin Wimpress, Ubuntu Desktop Lead, is Leaving Canonical ====

Joey Sneddon reports that Martin Wimpress will be leaving Canonical with the tweet that announced it to the world. Reminding us of Martin's work in the open-source world, and more recently in the Ubuntu Desktop Team, we are told Martin continues to lead the Ubuntu-MATE flavour.

==== Meet the Ubuntu 21.04 "Hirsute Hippo" Artwork by Sylvia Ritter ====

Marius Nestor gives us a peek of the new Hirsute Hippo artwork by Sylvia Ritter, created using open source tools, especially for the upcoming Ubuntu 21.04 release. We are also told the image is available in a format that will suit mobile phones & tablets, and is available now from the provided Deviant``Art link. Marius ends by reminding us of some features we'll see in Ubuntu 21.04 when it's released in April 2021.
