Notes:
* The "keys-signed-after-ev-date" column indicates the number of keys that you signed '''and were then published'''.  If this number is zero, then you haven't signed any keys from the event (or possibly they're stuck on your system if you used ''caff'' from a system with no MTA) -- please take action!  This number may be slightly lower than you might expect if you emailed the signed keys to each recipient, as some participants have not published their keys since the event.
* The "sigs-received-after-ev-date" column indicates the number of signatures from the event that you have acquired '''and were published'''.  If this is lower than you expect it to be, you may need to re-publish the latest version of your key.
