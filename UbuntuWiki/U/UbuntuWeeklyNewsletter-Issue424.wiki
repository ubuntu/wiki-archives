=== Ubuntu Phone News ===

==== Thoughts on Meizu MX4 ====

Ricardo Padovani reviews the Meizu MX4, comparing it to the BQ Aquaris E4.5. He describes the screen as perfect in relation to the BQ’s screen; with thin borders and sitting at 5.36 inches large, we can understand why. Regarding performance, he notes that the browser renders much quicker and that he receives up to 500 messages a day on Telegram without a bump.

=== In The Press ===

==== Intel To Release Ubuntu-Flavored Compute Stick ====

Lory Gil of Liliputing informs us that Intel is releasing an Ubuntu version (Intel product number STCK1A8LFC) of its compute stick for sale next week. The device will be available on-line and at brick and mortar stores like Best Buy, see: http://tinyurl.com/pp4ukur

==== Why Ubuntu plans to replace traditional Linux packages with something better ====

Chris Hoffman of PCWorld writes an overview of how Ubuntu has traditionally worked and contrasts that with the new Snappy system that is due to be an option for Ubuntu desktops in the near future. Reflecting on how Snappy works, he writes: “Applications are no longer installed system-wide. The base Ubuntu operating system is kept securely isolated from applications you install later. Both the base system and Snappy packages are kept as read-only images.” He concludes on a positive note and writes: “Ubuntu’s developers think the time is right to leave traditional Linux packages behind and replace them with something better.”

=== In The Blogosphere ===

==== Unity 8 Desktop Gains a Slick 3D Task Switcher ====

Joey-Elijah Sneddon of OMG! Ubuntu! tells us that Unity 8 has gained a 3D desktop spread that is triggered using the traditional Alt+Tab keyboard shortcut. He embeds a short video of the new app switcher in his post, warns that the new feature is still a work in progress, and that Unity 8 must be compiled from source in order to try the switcher.

http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2015/06/ubuntu-unity-8-desktop-window-switcher

==== BQ Aquaris E5: An Ubuntu Edition Phone that severely disappoints ====

Jack Wallen of Tech``Republic writes that his first experience of an Ubuntu Phone in the form of the BQ Aquaris E5 was disappointing, saying that the hardware is laggy and slow, there are critically few apps in the Ubuntu Store, and that scopes are little more than glorified short cuts to mobile web pages. After Jack points out further deficiencies he concludes his review saying: "Please, Canonical, go back to the drawing board and return with a UI that makes sense... or simply return all of your focus on what you do best and leave the mobile platform to Google and Apple."

http://www.techrepublic.com/article/bq-aquaris-e5-an-ubuntu-edition-phone-that-severely-disappoints/

==== Ubuntu MATE Announces A Partnership With A PC Hardware Vendor ====

Michael Larabel of Phoronix informs us that Ubuntu MATE has formed a partnership with Libre``Trend who ship the distribution pre-loaded on a "free software friendly and 100% blobless Linux driver" PC. Michael says that the price is rather high for the specification, suggests an alternative option, and says that he hopes the company will put out some other interesting hardware at a competitive price.

==== Ubuntu Is Finally Fixing Its Annoying GRUB Setting ====

Michael Larabel of Phoronix writes that an annoying GRUB configuration setting will be addressed in Ubuntu 15.10 and other releases via a stable release upgrade. He says that currently in the event of a system problem, the GRUB boot-loader screen will hang indefinitely until a user interacts with it but that the update will change the configuration to wait for just 30 seconds.
