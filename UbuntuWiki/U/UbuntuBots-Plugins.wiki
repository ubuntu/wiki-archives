__TOC__

ubotu, ubottu and all derivatives of ubottu run '''[http://sourceforge.net/projects/supybot/ supybot]'''. In addition to the core supybot code, ubottu runs a number of plugins&mdash;some official, some custom-built.

This page is supposed to give a listing of the plugins used with ubottu, and what their purpose is.

=== Bantracker ===
This plugin us used to manage bans. It logs every ban/mute/kick/remove done in a channel and saves a log preceding that action, it also allows comments to be stored by operators and access to this information via a web-based interface.

==== Commands ====

=== Encyclopedia ===
Stores and retrieves factoids. Also adds ignore/unignore capabilities to factoid editors

==== Using ====
The Encyclopedia plugin is used to store, retrieve and edit factoids; short pieces of information triggered by a specific term.<br />
In order to add/edit/forget factoids, a user must have the ''editfactoids'' capability; to add editors, a user must have the ''addeditors'' capability.
===== Retrieving a factoid =====
<pre>
<tsimpson> !factoid
<ubottu> Hi! I'm #ubuntu's favorite infobot, you can search my brain yourself at http://ubottu.com/factoids.cgi - Usage info: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBots
</pre>
===== Adding a factoid =====
<pre>
<tsimpson> !foo
<ubottu> Sorry, I don't know anything about foo
<tsimpson> !foo is bar
<ubottu> I'll remember that tsimpson
<tsimpson> !foo
<ubottu> foo is bar
</pre>
If the format "<term> is <factoid>" is not suitable, you can use the ''<reply>'' keyword:
<pre>
<tsimpson> !bar is <reply> baz
<ubottu> I'll remember that tsimpson
<tsimpson> !bar
<ubottu> baz
</pre>
===== Editing factoids =====
Editing existing factoids is done with the ''no'' keyword:
<pre>
<tsimpson> !foo is <reply> bar
<ubottu> But foo already means something else.
<tsimpson> !no foo is <reply> bar
<ubottu> I'll remember that tsimpson
<tsimpson> !foo
<ubottu> bar
</pre>
Factoids can also be edited with the ''<sed>'' keyword, this works similarly to the ''sed'' command-line tool:
<pre>
<tsimpson> !foo
<ubottu> bar
<tsimpson> !foo is <sed> /$/./
<ubottu> I'll remember that tsimpson
<tsimpson> !foo
<ubottu> bar.
</pre>
===== Aliasing one factoid to another =====
You can alias a factoid to another with the ''<alias>'' keyword, this is useful when you want more than one term to refer to the same information:
<pre>
<tsimpson> !foobar
<ubottu> Sorry, I know nothing about foobar
<tsimpson> !foobar is <alias> foo
<ubottu> I'll remember that tsimpson
<tsimpson> !foobar
<ubottu> baz
<tsimpson> !no foo is <reply> FOO!
<ubottu> I'll remember that tsimpson
<tsimpson> !foobar
<ubottu> FOO!
</pre>
When editing a factoid, always edit what the alias points to, so in the example above you edit "foo", not "foobar".
===== Forgetting factoids =====
If you want to remove a factoid you use the ''forget'' keyword:
<pre>
<tsimpson> !foo
<ubottu> FOO!
<tsimpson> !forget foo
<ubottu> I'll forget that tsimpson
<tsimpson> !foo
<ubottu> Sorry, I don't know anything about foo
</pre>
The factoid is '''not''' deleted, just marked as forgotten. This means that attempting to add a new factoid with the same name will not work:
<pre>
<tsimpson> !foo
<ubottu> Sorry, I don't know anything about foo
<tsimpson> !foo is <reply> bar
<ubottu> But foo already means something else!
</pre>
You must first ''unforget'' a factoid to edit it:
<pre>
<tsimpson> !unforget foo
<ubottu> I suddenly remember foo again, tsimpson
<tsimpson> !no foo is <reply> bar
<ubottu> I'll remember that tsimpson
</pre>

===== Looking for Factoids =====
If you are looking for a specific factoid but cannot remember which one, you can search the factoid database by factoid name or fact:

<pre>
!search <string>
</pre>

You can also browse and search the factoids on-line  [http://ubottu.com/factoids.cgi Here]

Sorted by:
* [http://ubottu.com/factoids.cgi?db=ubuntu&search=&order=popularity%20DESC&page=0 Most popular first]
* [http://ubottu.com/factoids.cgi?db=ubuntu&search=&order=added%20DESC&page=0 By date]
* [http://ubottu.com/factoids.cgi?db=ubuntu&search=&order=name%20ASC&page=0 Alphabetical]

===== Factoid modifiers =====
====== Getting factoid information ======
Some information on factoids can be retrieved by using the '-' modifier when calling a factoid. This information includes information on if the factoid is an alias to another, what factoids are aliases to the factoid, when the factoid was created, and when the factoid was last modified.

You can see this information by added the '-' modifier before the factoid name:
<pre>
<User> !-bot
<Bot> bot is <alias> ubotu - added by SomeNick on 2006-06-18 00:41:01 - last edited by AnotherNick on 2010-09-02 10:30:22
<User> !-ubotu
<Bot> ubotu aliases: yourself, bot, usage, factoid, brain, add, help me, syntax, factoids, everything, me, ubottu, bots, fact - added by SomeNick on 2006-06-19 12:15:56 - last edited by AnotherNick on 2010-09-18 20:14:50
</pre>

====== Getting raw factoids ======
The raw factoid, as it is stored in the database, can be retrieved by using the '+' modifier when calling a factoid. Sometimes it can be useful to see a raw factoid as it is stored in the database, for instance when working with <nowiki>[[#Variables|variable substitutions]]</nowiki>.

You can see the raw factoid by adding the '+' modifier before the factoid name:
<pre>
<User> !+ubotu
<Bot> <reply> Hi! I'm $chan's favorite infobot, you can search my brain yourself at http://ubottu.com/factoids.cgi | Usage info: http://ubottu.com/devel/wiki/Plugins | Bot channels and general info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/IRC/Bots
<User> !+lts
<Bot> <reply> LTS means Long Term Support. LTS versions of Ubuntu will be supported for 3 years on the desktop, and 5 years on the server. The current LTS version of Ubuntu is !$curLTS ($curLTSLong $curLTSNum)
</pre>

===== Variables =====
Ubottu also understands some variables and will substitute them when the factoid is called.

<pre>
<User> !lts is <reply> LTS means Long Term Support. LTS versions of Ubuntu will be supported for 3 years on the desktop, and 5 years on the server. The current LTS version of Ubuntu is !$curLTS ($curLTSLong $curLTSNum)
<Bot> I'll remember that, User
<User> !lts
<Bot> LTS means Long Term Support. LTS versions of Ubuntu will be supported for 3 years on the desktop, and 5 years on the server. The current LTS version of Ubuntu is !Hardy (Hardy Herron 8.04)
</pre>
====== $nick ======

====== $who ======
This variable will be repalced with the nick-name of the person who called the factoid. E.g: tsimpson

====== $chan ======
This variable will be replaced with the current channel the factoid is called in. E.g: #ubuntu

====== $curStable ======
This variable will be replaced with the name of the current stable version of Ubuntu. E.g: Jaunty

This variable will be replaced with the long name of current stable version of Ubuntu. E.g: Jaunty Jackalope

====== $curStableLower ======
Same as $curStable, but lower-case.

====== $curStableNum ======
This variable will be replaced with the version number of the current stable version of Ubuntu. E.g: 9.04
