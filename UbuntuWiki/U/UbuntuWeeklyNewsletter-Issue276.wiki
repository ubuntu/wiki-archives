=== LoCo News ===

==== Ubuntu-Co has a new video about Ubuntu! ====

Sergio Meneses writes about an Ubuntu video made by the Colombian Ubuntu team. The purpose of the video is “to spread the word about Ubuntu”, its features, and possibilities. The video is available in Spanish only.  

http://sergioandresmeneses.wordpress.com/2012/07/24/ubuntu-co-has-a-new-video-about-ubuntu/

=== Launchpad News ===

==== You can hide your bug and question comments ====

Curtis Hovey writes about a new "hidden comments" feature in Launchpad. Everyone can now hide their bug and question comments, and only the “project maintainer or trusted people delegated to work with private information can see hidden comments.” 

http://blog.launchpad.net/general/you-can-hide-your-bug-and-question-comments

==== Project maintainer can see private bugs ====

Curtis Hovey compares the old and new Launchpad functionality related to private bugs visibility. Hovey states:” Launchpad tried to ensure that proper people could see the the bugs in the past but the old mechanism was brittle.” Recently, purple squad migrated project configurations to project sharing which “makes all private information visible to project maintainers and ensures that confidential information is disclosed to proper people.”

==== Canonical Design Team: Introducing web apps ====

Christian Goirdano explains the reasoning behind introducing web apps in Unity. He reasons that today, the web is a major part of our lives, and the Unity shell is in the best position to provide desktop integration with the web. He states web apps will go beyond simple web links; they will integrate into the Unity interface (e.g: via sound menu, Notify-OSD)

http://design.canonical.com/2012/07/introducing-web-apps/

==== Ubuntu App Developer Blog: The Ubuntu App Showdown – followup reviews ====

Michael Hall writes about the apps review stage following the Ubuntu App Showdown. Hall states: “Over the last two weeks we have been working diligently to get all of the app showdown entries reviewed as a part of ARB process so they could be published to the Ubuntu software center.” He reports that half of the apps passed their review, but a large number of apps still need review. Hall asks for help from people who both participated in the initial app review and those who didn't. Hall also gives explicit instructions about how to conduct the app review.

==== Didier Roche: Unity Radios lens for quantal ====

Didier Roche shares his work on the radio lens for Quantal Quetzal. Roche states: “You can search through thousands of online available radios, ordered by categories with some contextual informations based on your current language and location.”

==== Nicholas Skaggs: Remembering the good ole days ====

Quality Assurance (QA) team leader Nicholas Skaggs writes about the changes in Ubuntu's QA process over the years. Previously, everything “just worked” in Ubuntu for the average user; now things may suddenly break. Fortunately, the amazing QA team quickly triages the bugs to the point of failure, and bugs get squashed upstream. That is the power of community!

http://www.theorangenotebook.com/2012/07/remembering-good-ole-days.html

==== Benjamin Kerensa: Test Your Hardware on 12.04 with Ubuntu Friendly ====

Benjamin Kerensa writes about the Ubuntu Friendly program for testing hardware on Ubuntu and encourages users to participate. He explains that you “can help provide data on your hardware by using “Checkbox” to do some system testing which can be found by searching for “System Testing” or by simply running “checkbox-qt” from command-line.”

http://benjaminkerensa.com/2012/07/24/test-your-hardware-on-12-04-with-ubuntu-friendly

==== Nicholas Skaggs: What can webapps do? Help test and see! ====

Nicholas Skaggs invites volunteers to help test and locate bugs in Ubuntu web apps. Testers can choose test cases corresponding to their version of Ubuntu. Skaggs' article also provides a walk-through for newcomers.

http://www.theorangenotebook.com/2012/07/what-can-webapps-do-help-test-and-see.html

==== Jono Bacon: Ubuntu Accomplishments: Call For Volunteers! ====

Ubuntu Accomplishments is heading to its 0.3 release. The goals of that release, as Bacon states, include: 

* quality assurance and stability in the platform 
* ability to provide users' accomplishments on-line 
* expanding the range of accomplishments 
* expanding and improving documentation for accomplishments
* providing greater breadth of translation coverage

Since a lot of work is required to accomplish the goal, Bacon asks for help from volunteers. The ideal volunteer profiles required by Bacon includes: programmers, documentation writers, translators, testers, and support.

==== Barneedhar: Ask Ubuntu update for July 2012 ====

Compliments are paid to the community and moderators of Ask Ubuntu for the high quality maintained on the site. The article also states the 3 hottest question of the month, details of Ask Ubuntu on Google+, and highlights of Ask Ubuntu on its second-year anniversary.

=== In The Press ===

==== Facebook, Last.fm and pals to reach deep into Ubuntu ====

Gavin Clarke of The Register talks about the new web apps feature in Ubuntu. He compares web apps to pinning websites to the taskbar in Microsoft’s Internet Explorer but with more capabilities. 40 sites, including Facebook and Last.Fm, have been made into web apps so far, and Canonical indicates that more are on the way.

http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/07/23/ubuntu_web_apps/

==== Dell's Increasingly Excellent Linux Adventures ====

Katherine Noyes, Tech News World, writes about Dell’s “Linux adventures”. Noyes summarizes Linux bloggers' opinions about Dell’s efforts to bring Linux to many consumers. Linux Rants, one of the bloggers, said: "I think it's great that a prominent OEM like Dell is releasing a Linux based laptop. I think they all should, and they should market those computers to the general population. The average consumer would surely be interested in Linux's many advantages if only they knew about them." 

http://www.technewsworld.com/story/75739.html

=== In The Blogosphere ===

==== Thunderbird 15 Beta 1 Adds New Look, Ubuntu One Support ====

Joey Sneddon, OMG!Ubuntu!, writes about Thunderbird 15 Beta 1 release and its features, including: 

* Search bar now sifts through conversations using its built-in IM client, which supports Facebook and Google Talk as well as your email.
* ‘Do not track’ support.
* Large file attachments can be added to e-mails using Ubuntu One.

==== 5 Reasons to consider Ubuntu for your small business ====

Armando Roggio of Practical Ecommerce shares five reasons why small businesses should use Ubuntu:

* Less worry about viruses, trojans, and other malware
* Better performance on older hardware
* Key software on Windows is possible to run under Ubuntu 
* Lots of helpful, free-to-use software 
* It is easy

==== Latest Stable VLC Heading to Ubuntu 12.04, Help Test It Now ====

Joey Sneddon, from OMG!Ubuntu!, writes about the latest stable VLC release soon to be released to the Software Center for Ubuntu 12.04. Sneddon states that because VLC will be in the Ubuntu Software Center, there won’t be a need to install unstable PPAs to keep VLC up-to-date. Since VLC hasn’t arrived in the Ubuntu Software Center yet, testing is needed according to Benjamin Drung, one of the Ubuntu developers. Sneddon also highlighted instructions on how to test VLC.

==== Ubuntu App Developer Showdown Likely To Be Repeated ====

Saurav Modak of Muktware writes about the Ubuntu App Developer Showdown and the big interests for that event. Modak also discusses the "Ubuntu on Air" event, which occurred on July 26th. One of the questions asked of the Ubuntu developers during the "Ubuntu on Air" session was about repeating the Ubuntu App Showdown. Ubuntu developers answered that “there is a possibility that Ubuntu app showdown will be repeated due to increased interest for that event.”

==== What’s new with Ubuntu? ====

Jeremy Proome, My``Broadband, writes about features in the current distribution of Ubuntu (Precise Pangolin 12.04). Proome also look ahead to features that are going to be included in the next Ubuntu release, like a new HUD and web apps integration. Finally, Proome highlights Mark Shuttleworth's keynote address at OSCON 2012.

==== Alpha 3 articles ====

There have been several Ubuntu Alpha 3 release articles published online. Here’s a quick sampling of some that caught the attention of our editors:
* Ubuntu 12.10 Alpha 3 Released - Joey Sneddon talks about the latest features arriving in Ubuntu 12.10, namely a revamped Nautilus, Linux kernel 3.5, a splendid loading screen from Libre``Office, a long-awaited restart button on the Session Manager, and several others. http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2012/07/ubuntu-12-10-alpha-3-released
* Ubuntu 12.10 Alpha 3 Has Firefox 15 and Unity 6 - Marius Nester of Softpedia reports that Firefox 15 beta, an updated Unity, and Libre``Office 3.6 RC2 are present in Ubuntu 12.10 Alpha 3. The alpha-release also fixes many bugs from Precise. http://news.softpedia.com/news/Ubuntu-12-10-Alpha-3-Has-Firefox-15-and-Unity-6-283214.shtml
* Ubuntu 12.10 Alpha 3 Screenshot Tour - Alpha 3 shows off some of its many feature. Unity now has an improved HUD with smooth corners and a refined filter system. Nautilus is packed with greater functionality thanks to a "settings" button. Libre``Office has a vibrant, aesthetically pleasant green loading screen. http://news.softpedia.com/news/Ubuntu-12-10-Alpha-3-Screenshot-Tour-283215.shtml
* Ubuntu 12.10 Alpha 3 unifies usermenus -  The H Open acknowledges that Ubuntu 12.10 alpha 3 addresses users' concerns of too many user menus by unifying them (e.g. “software updater”). However, Ubuntu 12.10 is still having issues with the Ambiance theme for the revamped Nautilus. http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/Ubuntu-12-10-Alpha-3-unifies-user-menus-1654180.html
