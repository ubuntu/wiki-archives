=== Edgy Eft Knot-2 released ===

Knot-2, the latest development release of Edgy Eft (which will become Ubuntu 6.10), has been released.  This release brings the addition of several new desktop applications (for example, Tomboy, a note-taking program and F-Spot, a photo manager), a new Kubuntu theme, and much more. You can read more at <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/knot2|the Knot-2 page on Ubuntu.com]]</nowiki> or <nowiki>[[http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/edgy/knot-2/|download Knot-2]]</nowiki>.

=== Upstart reaches a new milestone ===

Upstart, Ubuntu's new event-based service management daemon, has reached the point where it can replace the sysvinit package. Steady progress is being made by the author, Scott James Remnant, working towards the goal of replacing the legacy sysvinit as the default system init for Edgy. You can read more, including what and how to test, on <nowiki>[[http://www.netsplit.com/blog/work/canonical/upstart2.html|Scott's blog]]</nowiki>, where he also talks about various event types and how to get involved in development. Upstart has even gained a logo, created by Alexandre Vassalotti, as seen on Scott's blog.

=== Google Summer of Code finishes for another year ===

Google's Summer of Code projects were handed in on August 21 and we can now see the final results. As previously reported, Ubuntu started with 22 projects, which can be seen at <nowiki>[[http://code.google.com/soc/ubuntu/about.html|Google's page of Ubuntu projects]]</nowiki>. Please note that this list was compiled through the diligent research of several members of the Ubuntu marketing team and thus might not be completely correct. If we have missed anything, we apologize in advance.

It's basically done, but i need to get a patch into wine for one of the settings to work right. Wine devs wanted my patch to change a bit more than i intended, so once that gets in i need to change that part of my module a little as well. Currently it's all in guidance in KDE svn."

* Status - Released
* Project page - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Accessibility/Projects/onBoard
Chris Jones says:
"[The package is] reasonably feature complete and i'm getting quite a lot of positive feedback from users.  Heno [Henrik Nilsen Omma], my SoC mentor and one of the Ubuntu-a11y team is hoping to get it in main for edgy and hopefully on the CD too. (...) It's an on-screen keyboard meant to be a simpler alternative to the current gnome on-screen keyboard.  It concentrates on point-and-click based users, leaving GOK to handle switching scanning users."

=== Security Updates ===

There were no security updates this week

=== Ubuntu 6.06 LTS Updates ===

OpenOffice.org 2.0.3 has been uploaded to dapper-proposed, the testing archive for updates to Ubuntu 6.06.  Using the -proposed archive helps ensure new updates are free of serious bugs, such as the X.org issue, before they are released to the general -updates archive.  If you are able, please help us test this update.

=== New Apps In Edgy ===

This week brought much D-Bus love to edgy. (For those who don't know, D-Bus is an "interprocess communication" tool. In laymans terms, it allows apps to talk to one another). A whole host of people, including Sebastian Droege, Michael Biebl, Sjoerd Simons, Anthony Baxter, Daniel Stone, DavidZeuthen, Michel Daenzer, Daniel Silverstone, Kevin Ottens, Daniel Holbach, helped close 56 bugs by working on '''dbus 0.92'''.

Giuseppe Borzi brought in '''keytouch-editor 2.2.1''' , which should make people's lives easier with this program to configure the extra function keys of the keyboard.

Lucas Nussbaum working on '''sqlrelay 0.37.1''', bringing some egdy goodness to those who indulge in database connection pooling, proxying and load balancing.

Jeremie Corbier, Stephen Gran and Mark Hymers brought us '''freeradius 1.1.3''', a high-performance and highly configurable RADIUS server. This is a mostly bug fix version.

Brandon Hale uploaded '''Beagle 0.2.8''' this week, which fixed an indexing issue amongst a whole slew of other bugs.

Szilveszter Farkas uploaded '''nanoweb 2.2.8''', a small webserver written in PHP, which adds a spamcatcher module and fixes some bugs.

Brandon Holtsclaw uploaded '''konversation 1.0''', the 1.0 release of the KDE IRC client. 

=== Bug Stats ===

=== In The Press ===

The xkcd webcomic takes an amusing look at the sudo command:

<nowiki>[[File:sandwich.png]]</nowiki>

Source: http://xkcd.com/c149.html

Search''Open''Source.com takes a look at Ubuntu's success and future prospects:

''The message from end users is consistent: Ubuntu has the chops to continue on its successful path toward wider adoption in the enterprise. Driving those accolades are factors like ease of installation on the desktop as well as the spirited community that has sprung up around the operating system. Today, according to Web sites like DistroWatch.com, Ubuntu has more than 70,000 developers under its umbrella and is the most popular Linux OS distribution.''

=== Feature Of The Week - Gobby ===

Have you ever tried working on the same documents with many people?  You may have discovered how difficult it is. You may have seen this happen in company or charity offices around the world.

Computer programmers, like those who work on Ubuntu, encounter similiar challenges every day. The Ubuntu developers are spread out across several continents, time-zones and countries, so collaboration can be difficult.  Developers try to manage collaboration with  "revision control" or "version control" tools.  Revision control systems allow people to collaborate simultaneously on the same projects.

In an office environment, you may start with a draft document that everyone ''nearly'' agrees on.  The lawyers take the draft away to add a disclaimer, Kelly from accounts improves one of the graphs, Sam in press-relations spices up some of the language...  When the three teams meet again at the end of the day, there are now '''three''' copies, all slightly different.  The next step might be to appoint one person to stitch the copies back together and integrate the three sets of changes.  This is the stage where the programmers win, the automatic ''revision control'' tools take over, attempt to detect each change and to splice the change accurately into the final copy.

With so many people online throught the internet, it would be great to have those same features available ...but without having to be programmers.  A solution to that is "Gobby", which you can easily install from the Add/Remove programs menu.

<nowiki>[[File:uwn-gobby-reduced.png]]</nowiki>

After starting up Gobby and connecting to a central server (or having other people connect to your own machine) you can share editing of a document.  You can see in the screenshot above, that several of the Weekly News editors are working together; can you guess what the document is?  Changes are easy to follow in real-time, with text from each connected user appearing in a different background colour.  There's no restrictions about two people updating the same paragraph at the same time, you can start editing a sentence even while another person is continuing to type words.  As soon as each character is typed, that letter immediately flashes up on everyone else's screen.

Real-time editing is a real beauty to work with, so much so, that Gobby is now frequently used at Ubuntu conferences and summits.  With a dozen developers seated around a table, it is possible for everyone to see, read, update and improve the same specification document.  The ultimate added advantage of Gobby is that anyone ''not'' at the conference can also just as easily connect, log-on with Gobby and start collaborating.  Joining in with the editing, regardless of where in the world that Ubuntero may be.

Gobby is fun, fast, colourful and genuinely useful.  Check it out with a quick visit to Synaptic, Adept or the Add/Remove programs menu and start typing with you friends, colleagues or family!
