==== Karmic Alpha 3 released ====

Welcome to Karmic Koala Alpha-3, which will in time become Ubuntu 9.10.

Pre-releases of Karmic are *not* encouraged for anyone needing a stable system or anyone who is not comfortable running into occasional, even frequent breakage. They are, however, recommended for Ubuntu developers and those who want to help in testing, reporting, and fixing bugs.

Alpha 3 is the third in a series of milestone CD images that will be released throughout the Karmic development cycle.  The Alpha images are known to be reasonably free of show-stopper CD build or installer bugs, while representing a very recent snapshot of Karmic. You can download it here:

* Ubuntu: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/karmic/alpha-3/
* Kubuntu: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/releases/karmic/alpha-3/
* Xubuntu: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/xubuntu/releases/karmic/alpha-3/
* Ubuntu Studio: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntustudio/releases/karmic/alpha-3/

See http://wiki.ubuntu.com/Mirrors for a list of mirrors.

Alpha 3 includes a number of software updates that are ready for large-scale testing. This is quite an early set of images, so you should expect some bugs. For an overview of new features and a list of known bugs (that you don't need to report if you encounter).

* For Ubuntu please see: http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/karmic/alpha3

* For Kubuntu please see: https://wiki.kubuntu.org/KarmicKoala/Alpha3/Kubuntu

If you're interested in following the changes as we further develop Karmic, have a look at the karmic-changes mailing list: http://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/karmic-changes

==== Launchpad is now open source ====

Released today under the GNU Affero General Public license, version 3, Launchpad's code is now open source. Note that although it had been previously announced that two components (codehosting and soyuz) would be held back, a last minute change now includes both.

Big congratulations, (and thanks) to the Canonical Launchpad team, who worked overtime to make this happen sooner rather than later, and to Mark Shuttleworth, whose decision it was to open source Launchpad in the first place.

Listed below are the links to the announcement, the development wiki, and where to get the code:

* launchpad-users mailing list: https://lists.launchpad.net/launchpad-users/msg05118.html
* Blog post at Canonical.com: http://blog.canonical.com/?p=192
* Press release: http://www.ubuntu.com/news/canonical-open-sources-launchpad/
* The development wiki: https://dev.launchpad.net/
* Instructions for getting the code: https://dev.launchpad.net/Getting

The Canonical Launchpad developers will be on IRC in channel #launchpad-dev on irc.freenode.net. That’s the place to go for real time development discussion and questions. For usage issues, #launchpad is still the place, as before.

=== Launchpad News ===

==== Launchpad 2.2.7: translation sharing, release file, automation and more ====

The Launchpad team is proud to announce Launchpad 2.2.7

Launchpd 2.2.7 was rolled out this past week and includes:

* Sharing translations between different releases
* Automatic merge of project translations to a Bazaar branch
* Automatically import release files using product release finder
* Answer contacts can now assign questions
* Browse package branches that are being uploaded
* Source code

Message sharing between different releases of a product or distribution in Launchpad means that translations done in one release (e.g., trunk) would immediately apply to translations in another release (e.g., stable). This should benefit almost all projects that use Launchpad for translations.

Launchpad can now commit regular snapshots of your project's translations to a Bazaar branch of your choice.  No more waiting for the email with the URL! The latest snapshot will always be waiting in the same place for you to download it. We're doing daily snapshots at first, though we may change that later depending on usage.

The product release finder process runs daily to locate new releases and import them to Launchpad.  It uses each series' release file pattern to locate files and import them to the appropriate release, and can even create releases for series.

Read more about this exciting new release from Launchpad at the link.

==== Focusing on the Launchpad UI ====

Now that Launchpad’s source code has been released, the next couple of months of work are going to be mostly focused on page layouts. Launchpad has been around for quite a few years now, and tight release schedules packed with ever-changing features have had the side effect of having a lot of pages with different layouts. In the next 2 months, they plan to fix that, and make sure every single page in Launchpad (452 templates!) has the new “3.0 look n’ feel”.

Since it will take some time to make all the changes, they will most likely not make a Launchpad release in August, and jump straight to September. Roll-outs to the edge server will continue to happen daily, and they’ll need your feedback on the changes more than ever. If you’re interested in helping us, just join the beta testers team. https://launchpad.net/~launchpad-beta-testers

Visit the link below to see a mock-up of what the new overview page might look like.

==== David Planella: Kubuntu Translations Day ====

It’s not a secret that Kubuntu translations have needed love for some time, but it’s not a secret that the Kubuntu team wants to make Kubuntu Karmic a rock-solid release on translations. They’d like to get Kubuntu translations in shape for Karmic and they’re organizing an all day event for this purpose.

* WHAT: Kubuntu Translations Day
* WHERE: #kubuntu-devel IRC channel on Freenode
* WHEN: Wednesday, the 29th of July 2009

How can you participate? You simply need to join #kubuntu-devel on that day and be willing to make Kubuntu translations rock! Here are some suggestions for activities you can do.

==== Canonical Releases Launchpad Source Code ====

Linux.com says that a major advantage of open source software development is the communication between the members of any given project. But what happens when communication must take place between projects? That's where a web-based collaboration service like Launchpad comes in. Today, over two years after it was launched as a public beta, Canonical, Ltd. has released the source code for Launchpad, which will allow the development community to work on the Launchpad tool itself. “Launchpad is designed to accelerate collaboration between open source projects,” said Canonical founder Mark Shuttleworth in a press release. “Collaboration is the engine of innovation in free software development, and our intent in creating Launchpad is to support one of the key strengths of free software compared with the traditional proprietary development process. Projects that are hosted on Launchpad are immediately connected to every other project hosted there in a way that makes it easy to collaborate on code, translations, bug fixes and feature design across project boundaries. Rather than hosting individual projects, we host a massive and connected community that collaborates together across many projects. Making Launchpad itself open source fulfills a long term intention to give the users of Launchpad the ability to improve the service they use every day.” http://www.linux.com/news/software/developer/29342-canonical-releases-launchpad-source-code

==== Launchpad Is Now Fully Open-Source Software ====

Phoronix's Michael Larabel reminds us that last year on the 22nd of July he was covering the OSCON 2008 event. There really wasn't anything great about that year's open-source conference from O'Reilly, but Mark Shuttleworth was there and had keynoted at one of the evening events. Among other statements, Mark said that Launchpad would be open-source within 12 months. Well, with tomorrow marking the one-year anniversary, Canonical has early this morning pushed out the source-code to Launchpad. Launchpad is now fully open-source! A few months back when looking at the road-map to an open-source Launchpad it looked like some of its components would not actually be open-sourced, but with today's surprise announcement, everything has been open-sourced. Yes, it includes the Soyuz and Codehosting components. Launchpad is being licensed under the AGPLv3. http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=NzM5Mg

==== Ubuntu 9.10 Karmic Koala Alpha 3 Released ====

Michael Larabel of Phoronix reports that right on schedule, Ubuntu 9.10 Alpha 3 has been released. This third alpha release brings package updates to the Linux kernel, the desktop (both GNOME and KDE), and other packages throughout the Ubuntu repositories. Likewise, Kubuntu, Xubuntu, and Ubuntu Studio have all reached an Alpha 3 milestone status too. The different flavors of Ubuntu, such as Ubuntu Server and Ubuntu Netbook Remix, have also been spun. The Ubuntu 9.10 Alpha 3 release announcement can be found on ubuntu-devel-announce along with the relevant download links. http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=NzQwMw

==== Ubuntu 9.10 Alpha 3 Comes with Ubuntu One and Linux Kernel 2.6.31 ====

Softpedia's Marius Nestor tells us that the Ubuntu developers unleashed the third alpha version of the upcoming Ubuntu 9.10 (Karmic Koala) operating system, which is scheduled for release in late October this year. As usual, Softpedia has downloaded a copy of it in order to keep you up to date with the latest changes in the Ubuntu 9.10 development. What's new in Ubuntu 9.10 Alpha 3? Ubuntu 9.10 Alpha 3 has a new development version of the GNOME desktop environment, 2.27.4, which brings cool new features. Sad news for Pidgin fans, as the development team decided to replace it with the Empathy instant messenger client. Brasero received a few weeks ago a new interesting feature that shows how much data was written on the CD/DVD media and how much free space is available. Another useful and highly anticipated feature is the completely rewritten login manager (GDM), which works like any other modern login manager (e.g. KDM, the KDE login manager). In short, it means that you don't have to write both your name and password anymore, in order to log in. Just click on your name and you will be immediately prompted for the password. Ubuntu One is now part of the Ubuntu operating system! The already popular Notify-OSD notification system introduced in Ubuntu 9.04 (Jaunty Jackalope) has been revamped. The default web browser in Ubuntu, Mozilla Firefox, received a new add-on called Multisearch. The User Switch applet has been modified drastically. Last but not least, the kernel packages are at version 2.6.31-3.19, based on Linux kernel 2.6.31 RC3, and the Kernel Mode Setting is now enabled by default for Intel graphics! http://news.softpedia.com/news/Ubuntu-9-10-Alpha-3-Comes-with-Ubuntu-One-and-Linux-Kernel-2-6-31-117368.shtml

==== 12 ideas Ubuntu should steal from Windows 7 ====

Adam Oxford of Tech Radar tells us that the next version of Ubuntu is launching exactly one week after Windows 7 hits the shelves. Codenamed Karmic Koala, Oxford says he's loving the alpha version already, but there are some things that Windows does that Ubuntu should (but probably won't) do, to help woo people away. This includes better boot time, improved suspend and hibernate, improvements to the taskbar, parental controls of systems, a better help system, drive encryption, side by side view, a better sound system, an improved media player, the ability to sync devices, a good backup solution, and user access control. http://www.techradar.com/news/software/operating-systems/12-ideas-ubuntu-should-steal-from-windows-7-618472?src=rss

==== A Hands on and Review of Ubuntu One ====

Make``Tech``Easier's Damien Oh presents us with a hands on review of the Ubuntu One online file syncing service which allows you to share and sync file across different computers. At the moment, Ubuntu One only offers simple file storage/synchronization/sharing with others. Those are the basic stuffs that most online file storage services provide, so there is nothing special about it. Ubuntu One is still at beta mode and there are plenty of things that are not on par with other online storage solution such as Dropbox. However, with the vision of Ubuntu One and as Ubuntu become more and more popular, he won’t be surprised to see Ubuntu One becoming a major force in the file and data management arena in the near future. http://maketecheasier.com/a-hands-on-and-review-of-ubuntu-one/2009/07/21

==== Move Over, Netbooks: Ubuntu On Smartbooks? ====

Joe Panettieri, of Works With U, introduces this blending of Smartphones and Netbooks.  Qualcomm has been pushing Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) to build these bridging devices that have a larger screen and full keyboard and are always on and run on the 3G wireless networking. According to a Works With U poll, one third of it's readers would like to have an Ubuntu based Mobile Internet Device (MID) like Qualcomm is suggesting, and Qualcomm appears to be hiring Ubuntu talent to help develope them.

==== Ubuntu to make Linux application installation idiot proof ====

Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols, the Cyber Cynic, posting on the Computer``World blogs, discusses Ubuntu's interest in starting up an application center.  He quotes the Ubuntu site, "There will be a single graphical interface for package management in Ubuntu, currently codenamed App``Center. . . . This will combine the human-readable approach of Add/Remove Applications, the power of Synaptic, and the ease of use of Update Manager."  According to him, this App``Center will show up in October of 2009, in the next release of Ubuntu.  You can find his article at:  http://blogs.computerworld.com/ubuntu_to_make_linux_application_installation_idiot_proof

==== One Hundred Paper Cuts Round 2 Progress Report ====

David Siegel reports on the One Hundred Papercuts Project.  Four were fixed in this round:

* Scrolling over your desktop no longer causes seasickness
* Warn users who attempt to run updates on battery power
* Don’t show esoteric “Sign” and “Encrypt” entries in file context menus
* Remove “Open with” and quotation marks from entries in “Open with” sub-menu
* Show application icons in the “Open with” sub-menu

with others in varying degrees of "need to be fixed".  His report can be found at:  http://davidsiegel.org/100papercuts-round-2/

==== Review: The Official Ubuntu Book, 4th Edition ====

James Pyles reviews the latest edition of the Official Ubuntu Book.  Starting right from the Forward and Preface and ending with the Appendices, he outlines what each chapter is about, including some of the changes that have come about by the maturing of Ubuntu.  He also makes some suggestions as to which chapters are for beginners, as well as what would benefit those who wish to move beyond that point, and which are for more advanced users.  His whole review can be seen at:  http://millionchimpanzees.blogspot.com/2009/07/review-official-ubuntu-book-4th-edition.html

==== Ubuntu App Store: Open for Business? ====

Writing for Works With U, the VAR guy takes a look at Ubuntu's new app store that is still in Beta.  One of the first things he notes is that this new app store, Apperi, is not built by Canonical.  Also, he notes that it's built on an advertising model.  However, it's his opinion that it is still too early to tell if Apperi will be a success even though he feels that users and partners want and need a centralized, commercialized location for downloading and installing new applications.  His report can be seen at:  http://www.workswithu.com/2009/07/21/ubuntu-app-store-open-for-business/

==== Kubuntu Jaunty: Just ‘cos I use it don’t mean it’s good ====

feicipet, writing for the Educated New Village Boy, examines the Kubuntu version of Jaunty Jackalope.  His conclusions are that it seems to miss it's mark as a "just works" release.  His opinion comes about by the significant amount of tweaking and fine-tuning to get it to a reasonably acceptable level of performance, including installing a different kernel and upgrading to KDE 4.3.  It's for these and other reasons that he doesn't feel that Jaunty was a particularly successful release.  Read more at:  http://envb.sapphirewillow.com/writings/2009/07/kubuntu-jaunty-just-cos-i-use-it/

==== Measuring Ubuntu’s Market Share ====

Blogger Christopher Tozzi from Works With U gives us a breakdown on the difficulty inherent in putting a hard number on Ubuntu's marketshare. He covers some of the difficulties in defining "market share", like if you are dual booting, or if it's installed on an old computer that you use every once in a while. We are also introduced to Canonical's claims of a userbase of 8 million, without any qualifications for that figure. Another way that he tries to come up with a number is through Distro``Watch. This says that Ubuntu is about 1.5 times as popular as Fedora, which offers some published statistics. The sale of Dell Netbooks is another way that can be used to figure out Ubuntu's market share. This is made difficult due to Dell not releasing their sales figures for their Netbooks. Christopher Tozzi comes to the conclusion that it doesn't really matter how many people use Ubuntu as long as they like it. http://www.workswithu.com/2009/07/24/measuring-ubuntus-market-share/

==== Ubuntu Server Edition: Where’s the Official Support? ====

Christopher Tozzi, writing for Works For U, tackles subject matter that may initially confuse people based on its title.  Here, he's not talking about the commercial support offered by Canonical, but rather the amount of support of developers for porting and packaging applications for Ubuntu.  He notes three in his article that he's come across that are only supported for RPM distribution, and feels that Canonical needs to work harder to get developers to package server applications for Ubuntu Server Edition.  His report is at:  http://www.workswithu.com/2009/07/20/ubuntu-server-edition-wheres-the-official-support/

==== Welcome to McBuntu's, would you like fries with that? ====

By comparing Linux installations to the difference between a fast-food restaurant and one meant for a sit-down dinner, this article goes a long way toward explaining choice and the reasons for it. The author suggests that Ubuntu is like a fast-food restaurant, where the choices are somewhat limited to what the average user wants in a distribution but with the capability of adding more on. On the other hand, "Debian and Cent``OS and even Open``Suse are like a 'sit down' type of restaurant. Pop in the install DVD, look things over."  While saying that each has their place and their uses, he avoids condemning either one of them. See the article at:  http://linuxgeeksunited.blogspot.com/2009/07/welcome-to-mcbuntus-would-you-like.html
