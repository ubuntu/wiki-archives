__TOC__

A lot of modern netbooks ''just work'' with Ubuntu Netbook remix. See the <nowiki>[[HardwareSupport-Machines-Netbooks|Compatibility Page]]</nowiki> to find out if your netbook works 'out of the box' with UNR or if it requires 'tweaking'.

Ubuntu Netbook Remix (UNR) is a 'remix' of the standard Ubuntu Desktop release, enabling you to work better on devices with small screens, such as netbooks and sub-notebooks. You have access to all the same applications any Ubuntu user has, plus some enhancements to the user interface. For example: 
* All applications are opened "maximized", giving you the most of your screen space.
* Just one, top, panel.
* A "Desktop" that gives you easy access to all applications and ''Places''.
* Self definable '''Favorites''' giving you fast access to your most used applications, websites and storage.

=== Help and documentation ===

* Post any questions you may have (technical or not) about Ubuntu Netbook Remix by registering to http://www.launchpad.net and using the <nowiki>[[https://answers.edge.launchpad.net/netbook-remix|UNR Answers facility]]</nowiki>, by clicking on the blue '''Ask a question''' button.

=== Hints & Misc. ===

==== Removing the desktop ====
Whilst using dual monitors, I find that I can occasionally "click" on the desktop, which brings this above the netbook-launcher (And hiding it until I restart). Preventing nautilus from showing the desktop icons solves this, and is as simple as pasting the following line into a terminal

<code>gconftool-2 --type bool --set /apps/nautilus/preferences/show_desktop false</code>

'''__Deprecated__'''

'''''The stuff here isn't really needed anymore (as of release 9.10) or simply outdated.'''''

UNR consists of a small number of packages which attempt to modify the Ubuntu desktop experience for smaller screens. The packages can be used stand-alone or together and consist of:

* '''<nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/desktop-switcher|Desktop Switcher]]</nowiki>''' - Allows the user to switch between two desktop modes. Currently supports switching between Ubuntu Netbook Remix mode and "Classic Ubuntu" (two panels, gnome-like) mode.
* '''<nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/go-home-applet|Go Home Applet]]</nowiki>''' - A gnome-panel applet that, when clicked upon, displays the desktop. Used in a netbook-based desktop, the desktop-window will normally be the launcher. Go Home Applet also works in conjunction with the netbook-remix-launcher whereby dragging and dropping a file/url/application to the go-home-applet will automatically add it to the launcher's favorites section.
* '''<nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/human-netbook-theme|Human Netbook Theme]]</nowiki>''' - A gtk theme for use with Ubuntu Netbook Remix
* '''<nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/maximus|Maximus]]</nowiki>''' - A desktop daemon which will automatically maximise and, optionally, un-decorate windows. Has support for exclusion lists and will work with any EWMH-spec compliant window-manager.
* '''<nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/netbook-remix-launcher|Ubuntu Netbook Remix Launcher]]</nowiki>''' - An easy-to-use program/places/favourites launcher which resides on the desktop, replacing the main-menu.
* '''<nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/window-picker-applet|Window Picker Applet]]</nowiki>''' - A gnome-panel applet that displays open windows as icons on the panel, and has integrated window title-bar functionality. Optimised for use on netbook-size screens.

==== The Hard (not-recommended) Way ====

==== Look & Feel ====

As there isn't a configuration package available yet, you will need to setup the gnome-panel to mimic the standard UNR set-up. The applet order is as follows:
 <code>go-home-applet | window-picker-applet | notification-area-applet | mixer-applet | clock</code>

To move the panel to the bottom in Ubuntu Netbook Edition:

1. Open the configuration editor by pressing Alt + F2, then type gconf-editor and hit ENTER.
2. In the Configuration Editor, browse to /apps/panel/toplevels/top_panel
3. Look for the key "orientation", click on it and change its value to "bottom".

To have the panel autohide in Ubuntu Netbook Edition:

1. Open the configuration editor by pressing Alt + F2, then type gconf-editor and hit ENTER.
2. In the Configuration Editor, browse to /apps/panel/toplevels/top_panel
3. Look for the key "auto_hide", click on it to toggle its value.
