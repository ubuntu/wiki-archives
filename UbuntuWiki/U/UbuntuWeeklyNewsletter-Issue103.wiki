==== Intrepid Alpha-4 ahead ====

The expected release date of Intrepid Alpha 4 is this Thursday, August 14. Intrepid Alpha 4 will again use a "soft freeze" for main. This means that developers are asked to refrain from uploading packages between Tuesday and Thursday which don't bring us closer to releasing the alpha,

The list of bugs targeted for alpha-4 can be found at: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bugs?field.milestone%3Alist=1322

For a full review of what's still needed, please visit the link. https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel-announce/2008-August/000464.html

==== Ubuntu Studio is looking for help. ====

If you have an interest in multimedia applications, such as Inkscape, Ardour, Blender, Audacity, GIMP, etc., then Ubuntu Studio would like to hear from you.  They are looking for people who can package, or would like to learn packaging, people who can help design the look of the website and people who have documentation skills. Join the team at #ubuntustudio-devel, or introduce yourself on the mailing list:https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-studio-devel

https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-studio-devel/2008-August/000749.html

==== SRU needs you! ====

The number of stable release updates sitting in -proposed is getting larger[1]. Thank you to everyone who has worked on getting SRU bug fixes prepared and uploaded!

Packages in -proposed are ready to be moved to -updates after one week in -proposed and 2 positive verifications (as comments in the bug report) and no negatives. This means verification is often the bottleneck and why we're asking for help. A short howto is:

* read the SRU bug report and verify that you can reproduce the bug. Many reports should have explicit test cases you can follow.
* install the package(s) from -proposed
* repeat step 1 and verify that the bug is fixed
* add both positive and negative results on the SRU bug report

If you have any questions on SRU verifications please ask in #ubuntu-testing. Steve Beattie (sbeattie) is the teams SRU rock star and would love to help you get started.

==== Kernel Team ====

===== Ubuntu Kernel Next =====

Normally in Ubuntu's development cycle, work on the kernel doesn't begin for a release until that release opens for development. This time around however, the kernel team is starting something new. Now that 2.6.26 is released, and the kernel in Intrepid/8.10 (our current development cycle) is pretty stable, they have opened up a new git tree called ubuntu-next. Do not confuse this with linux-next, they are different concepts.

The team will not be spending a lot of time adding features to this tree. It is basically a rebase of all of the patches on top of the latest kernel in linux-2.6 upstream git. Patches are consolidated and given some consistency (and a few pushed upstream). At regular intervals, binary packages of this tree will be made available (usually at -rc milestones from upstream). In fact, the first installment of these are now available at: http://kernel.ubuntu.com/pub/next/2.6.27-rc2/

There are some things to remember when using this kernel, and they can be found here: https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/kernel-team/2008-August/002868.html

===== BarCamp Chicago! =====

August 16th and 17th, Chicago is holding its annual Bar``Camp Chicago event. It will start Saturday and run all the way through Sunday evening. FREE FOOD AND DRINK! Great talks and a lot of super cool IT people all getting together and hanging out. Last year was awesome! So if you are able to next week, go and hang out with the various area user groups and the Ubuntu Chicago Lo``C0. http://blog.nixternal.com/2008.08.09/barcamp-chicago/

==== Ubuntu Love Day Manila 2008 ====

The Ubuntu Philippines Local Community Team (Ubuntu-PH), and the University of the Philippines Diliman Department of Computer Science are holding an Ubuntu sharing event on August 23, 2008. Geared toward Ubuntu enthusiasts, it's an opportunity for people to share their experiences in using Ubuntu in everyday computing.  Six resource people are slated to present talks:

1. The Ubuntu 30 day challenge - Aileen Apolo (Google)
2. Ubuntu on virtualization and integrating to a Windows Network - Wallen Tan
3. Ubuntu: Saving lives (and then some) - Charo Nuguid
4. Choice is Good! Welcome to the Exciting, Productive and Wacky World of Ubuntu Derivatives - members of UP Linux Users' Group (UnPLUG)
5. Ubuntu and the OLPC XO-1 - Rowen Remis Iral (OLPCPH)
6. Kubuntu & KDE: Contributing to an International Software Project - Juan Carlos Torres (KDE Project)

Due to the limited space, tickets for the event have already been fully allocated.  http://ubuntuloveday2008.eventbrite.com/

=== New in Intrepid Ibex ===

==== Encrypted Private Directories ====

Do you have sensitive data on your computer? Perhaps a file containing all of your passwords? Financial spreadsheets or GPG/SSH keys?  Are you concerned about someone reading these files should your PC or laptop be stolen? In Ubuntu’s Intrepid Ibex development cycle, the Ubuntu Server Team is implementing support for an encrypted private directory in each user’s home. The underlying technology is a cryptographic virtual file system in the Linux kernel called eCryptfs.

Testers wanted! Most of the integration of Encrypted Private Directories has been completed in Intrepid, and now the team is looking for some proactive Ubuntu users to test this functionality before the legions of Ubuntu users begin trusting this technology with their personal data. With your help, hopefully the team can shake out any remaining functionality or usability issues.

Please follow the complete, step-by-step, up-to-date instructions in the wiki: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/EncryptedPrivateDirectory#head-4a2aa7460fdca18bfe78bb1283becff406bbc13c

=== Launchpad News ===

==== Inside the new Launchpad web service API ====

If you’ve been wanting to integrate Launchpad into your development tools, or create scripts that read and write Launchpad’s dataset, your wait is over. Launchpad released the initial version of their RESTful web service API to the beta testing team. Now you can integrate with Launchpad using our Python library or by making simple HTTP requests. Right now, the web service provides basic access to Launchpad’s people and bugs. The team is working now to expose more of Launchpad’s data–projects, milestones, and to improve the usability of the Python client. Read more about the exciting new features here: http://news.launchpad.net/cool-new-stuff/inside-the-new-launchpad-web-service-api

==== Survey about Launchpad’s upstream bug workflow ====

One of the cool things about Launchpad’s bug tracker is that it can link bugs together, regardless of whether they’re tracked in Launchpad or an external bug tracker. This is great for Ubuntu, where people report issues against an Ubuntu package of an upstream project. Jorge Castro works on Ubuntu’s community team and wants to know how Launchpad could improve this for upstream projects. If you’re from an upstream project and have an opinion on how to improve the work flow between Launchpad and your external bug tracker, take Jorge’s survey. http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=Grb6rCLEZaCZWhRpOveeaw_3d_3d

=== In The Press ===

* Linux World Expo Awards (Best Desktop Solution: Ubuntu Desktop Edition 8.04 LTS) -  Judged by a group of respected industry experts, the Linux``World Product Excellence Awards recognize product and service innovations by Linux``World® and Next-Generation Data Center™ (NGDC™) Conference & Expo exhibitors. The winners were recognized during a ceremony at the event on Tuesday, August 5. http://www.linuxworldexpo.com/live/12/media//news/CC969855

* Ubuntu attracts the lion's share of Linux``World's smaller crowds -  Michael Hatamoto noted that the Ubuntu booth seemed to attract more people than other booths.  Their presentations and training sessions were heavily attended in a year when overall attendance was sparse. See a pic of the Canonical/Ubuntu booth at the link. http://www.betanews.com/article/Ubuntu_attracts_the_lions_share_of_LinuxWorlds_smaller_crowds/1218146689

* Ubuntu Goes Enterprise - Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols explains that Ubuntu is about to release business software stacks for Small-to-Medium sized Businesses (SMB) and enterprises.  Some of the preloaded software intended to be released by 2009 is the IBM Open Collaboration Client Solution (OCCS) which includes Lotus Notes, Lotus Symphony and Lotus Sametime.  Another offering will be the Zimbra Collaboration Suite 5.5.  And still a third will be Unison, which is a combination desktop and server package.  http://www.cio.com/article/441702/

* A Penguin with an Egg: Growing the Open-Source Community -  Esther Schindler relates some of her experiences at the Open Source Convention (OSCON). She discusses how to include more than just developers in the community, and getting people to contribute in other ways than by just coding. This included talking to Mark Shuttleworth about attracting participants and interacting and integrating with upstream software providers.  Other discussions included the role of women in Open Source, and community management. Also mentioned in the article is the Open Web Foundation, and how it tries to encourage data as well as open source code to be available everywhere.  Some of this involves untangling licensing definitions.  Read more at http://www.cio.com/article/441165/

* Leadership Lessons: Passion, Smarts and What Open Source Can Learn About Management - Esther Schindler spoke to Mark Shuttleworth from Ubuntu, Jon Sobel (Source``Forge group president) and Ross Turk (community manager for Source``Forge.net) about management and the open source community.  One of the things that Ms. Schindler discovered is that there doesn't appear to be any training for managers in open source projects. And now it's time for open source to step up and innovate new methods of managing and training managers.   http://advice.cio.com/esther_schindler/leadership_lessons

* Giving new life to old computers - C.M. Boots-Faubert raises the age-old question: What do you do with a computer that no longer suits your needs?  The answer, of course, is to give it to a child that has none, loaded with a secure operating system like Xubuntu which makes it appear to run faster than it ever did before.  Not only that, but it comes with email and web browser, Abiword for doing homework and, oh yes, games.  http://www.capecodonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080805/BIZ/808050303

=== In The Blogosphere ===

* Canonical Preparing Virtual Ubuntu Server Appliances - The Var Guy briefly explains how Ubuntu is simplifying the installation of server applications in virtual server appliances.  The application stacks ride on top of the virtualization software without the need of special hardware beyond that traditionally used.

* Installfest: Untangle, Ubuntu Linux Saves 750 PCs From Landfills - Joe Panettieri has the final numbers from the Installfest at Linux``World Expo.  In an effort backed by Untangle and its partners, Ubuntu was installed on 750 used computers, resulting in an estimated savings of $375,000 over buying new PC's with Windows Vista installed.  This helps kids and the environment.  http://www.thevarguy.com/2008/08/07/untangle-ubuntu-linux-save-750-pcs-from-landfills/

* A practical experience: Fedora vs Ubuntu - The author of the blog site Journihilism compares Fedora and Ubuntu based on some personal preferences but without giving a definitive choice.  His purpose appears to be more toward showing the strengths of each distribution.  In his opinion, Ubuntu is easy to use, whereas Fedora is more stable and secure, however Ubuntu has a means of getting the codecs one needs where Fedora doesn't. http://journihilism.net/2008/08/a-practical-experience-fedora-vs-ubuntu/

* How Dell and System76’s Ubuntu Machines Stack Up to Their Mac Counterparts - Andrew Min compares prices and features of similarly equipped Mac, System76 and Dell(loaded with Ubuntu) computers in 4 different categories. Prices were somewhat comparable in the mini and low-end laptop categories.  But the System76 Serval took the high-end category and the Dell Inspiron 530N with Ubuntu installed took the desktop category. See the breakdown at: http://www.dawningvalley.com/2008/08/how-dell-and-system76s-ubuntu-machines-stack-up-to-their-mac-counterparts/
