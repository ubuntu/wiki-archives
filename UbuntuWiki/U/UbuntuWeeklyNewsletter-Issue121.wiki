==== Four Thousand People attend Ubuntu-fr Release Party ====

Organized by ubuntu-party and the French Lo``Co team, the event took place in the "Cité des sciences et de l'industrie" in Paris, on November 29th and 30th. Last year the event drew almost 3,000, and with 4,000 certified attendees, this years event was another recording breaking event for the French Lo``Co team.

The event included 14 hours of conferences that covered various topics such as  "what is Ubuntu?", "how to contribute to Ubuntu?" and "what is the French community Ubuntu-fr?". Other talks covered more general issues such as accessibility, achieving freedom through computer science, art and free culture, and open document formats. For new users, there were 8 hours of initiation training. Also included were sessions for beginners that taught them how to use Ubuntu on a day-to-day basis, and a more advanced session that covered command line usage.

The event also included an installation fest where literally hundreds of machines had Ubuntu installed by volunteers. Mozilla had a dedicated room where they attracted lots of attention with their talks. There was an Ubuntu discovery area where team members demonstrated the Ubuntu OS to new users, and a bugjam where attendees could learn how to triage bugs.

Local radio station oxyradio, and the French national newspaper Liberation covered the event by providing interviews, and a full page write up about the happening.

Congratulations to the French team for surpassing last years attendance mark and for hosting what could very well be the Ubuntu event of the year for Lo``Co teams. http://blog.didrocks.fr/index.php/post/Ubuntu-Party-Paris%3A-more-than-4-000-visitors!

==== Hall of Fame: Alberto Milone ====

Alberto Milone is best known for creating and maintaining envy, a tool to help people install nvidia drivers. After its introduction, it gained huge popularity in the community, and soon afterwards he started working on screen-resolution-extra, which made it easy to set up dual-head displays.

A few releases ago, these tools found their way into Ubuntu itself, and Alberto dove head-first into making the integration of graphic drivers and display related features in Ubuntu rock. The first step was writing x-kit, which contains code to parse, edit, and write xorg.conf. Nowadays he is maintaining the nVidia driver within Ubuntu.

Facts about Alberto that are probably not widely known yet: he studied foreign language in college, and is passionate about food, especially Italian! He not only directly helped Ubuntu to move X drivers out of linux-restricted-modules into their own much simpler packages, but also helped with moderation work in the Ubuntu Forums. In addition to these items, Alberto is a big fan of T.S. Elliot.

Alberto Milone is definitely one of the work-horses in the Ubuntu community, he is friendly and very approachable - we're not only very happy, but very lucky he is part of our community.

=== Interview with (huats), Leader of the Ubuntu-fr Team ===

- Who are you? Where do you live? What do you do for a living?

My name is Christophe Sauthier, and my nick is huats in IRC. I am 31, I live in Toulouse (France), and I am in a relationship. I work for a French service company (makina corpus) that only works in the open source world. I am involved with Ubuntu related training, assistance, and migration, but also some development in PHP (Drupal) and Python (Plone).

I am directly involved with Ubuntu as the leader of the French Lo``Co. My other main community role is coordinating the MOTU mentoring reception, which is geared at helping new comers in the Ubuntu development world. I also try to be active on a development level by helping with the packaging of some applications, mainly around the GNOME environment.

- How did you get involved with Linux and Ubuntu initially?

A long long time ago (something like 1996) I went to ask someone his opinion on a perl script I was working on (a cgi for a website in fact). He told me: "if you plan to develop a bit in Perl, you should use Linux. Here are some ways to install it...". That was my first contact with Linux. At that time, I mainly used Suse, and Debian. Then one day, I ran across something which was based on Debian but not named yet, it later became known as Ubuntu. That was in 2004, and since that day, Ubuntu has been the only distribution I have used.

- How did you get involved with the French Lo``Co?

I had been doing some French translations for some software (mainly in Gnome) for sometime, and one day I noticed a post on the French Lo``Co teams wiki that mentioned a bunch of projects that were about to be launched. One of them was the organization of interviews (and then translations) of some key members of the community. This project evolved later into various projects like Behind``Ubuntu.

- How did you come to lead the French Lo``Co?

After that first experience in the French Community, I decided to stay around, hanging out in the IRC of various French channels, or looking from time to time at the forums. That was where I saw the campaign to sell t-shirts for the Lo``Co. My first thought was 'I want one', and my second thought was 'I am sure I can help them to organize it'... After ordering mine, I contacted the guy who was leading the project, and there was so much work that my help was welcomed... it turned out that Yann (the guy I contacted), was the leader of the Lo``Co, and after lots of talks he told me that some help was also needed on the website development area. He asked me to show some proof that I able to help by developing a module for the punbb (the forum we are using for the French Lo``Co). I took on more and more work for the French Lo``Co, and when the leader decided to step down, they asked me if I was willing to face the challenge of trying to build a new team, with new organization. This is how I became the leader of the French Lo``Co, and I have tried to build the team using the "Team Work" concept.

- What are the challenges of running a large Lo``Co? How does your Lo``Co communicate, and reach such a large area?

There are many challenges, but it is also thrilling. The first challenge is of course trying to work everything into one day. There are some many solicitations that it is impossible to please everyone even though we want to try. So it ends up, that some people feel that we are just centered in one area, and that we don't care about the others. The fact is that it is usually a lack of manpower and/or time, and to show that, we are communicating more and more using a report blog. The blog is part of the French planet so it can be reached by everyone. We don't want to only limit ourself to the blog though, since we are also trying to be as transparent as we can on every decisions. Every month or so, we have a public IRC meeting. We try to deal with every aspect of our community: talking about the past actions (since the last meeting), the current ongoing actions, and the short/medium term ones. There is also an amount of time dedicated to questions where anyone can initiate a new topic for discussion. I think that this transparency interests people, for instance at the last meeting, something like 60 people attended.

- How is the French Lo``Co organized? Is it centralized or decentralized?

It is a mix. Of course there are a bunch of guys at the core of the Lo``Co, but with the new team organization, the core has grown a bit. The aim of each one of the cores is to have the big picture of everything that is happening in the Lo``Co, or at least to maximize its knowledge. By doing it that way, if we have someone who steps down, it makes it easier to replaced them. Around the core, is a bigger circle of people, who are more involved in one, or two areas. This second circle can be seen as dedicated teams for one area. So to sum up: a core of less than 10 people, that leads some team activities that are quite independent of the others. Each team has a wide perimeter of action, even though we like to be aware of big decisions.

- Sometimes Lo``Cos go through a slow period, where member participation or motivation may have decreased? How does the French Lo``Co battle that?

I think there has been a slow period like that in the French Lo``Co too. But I think its effect has been lowered by the change in the team organization that I mentioned earlier. It was noticeable during the period when the 'leaders' of the community were slowing down a bit, but there was not a big slowing down in our activities. This is indicative of a bigger community, that can sustain themselves for sometime without major damage... As long as it doesn't last too much of course... Since then, the Lo``Co is again on a good track, and is very active. Good examples are the parties we had all over the country for Intrepid, and of course the Paris event with more than 4000 attendants over the weekend. Since we don't want to slow down again, we are launching some small projects that should help us to tackle some areas that we are interested in. That should help to keep our Lo``Co and the community growing. They are kind of the projects that made me want to get involved in the community, so you can clearly imagine that I am really attached to them. We feel that in this way we can offset a decrease, or slowdown in membership by adding some new areas of interest to get involved with.

- What are your short term and longer term plans for the Lo``Co?

I'd say to keep the current work we have just initiated: to complete the various teams (some are still a bit blurred, or are just taking shape). For instance, there was not really a web development team, since we were just gathering some resources when needed. Right now a group of very talented people are working to tackle the various aspects for long term use, not just on demand. This is necessary if we want to be able to always be innovative. So for the short term, it's finding a new skin for the whole pack of ubuntu-fr sites (www, documentation, forums and planet), to take advantages of our new www website (drupal), and give our editors the rights to many teams (the kubuntu or the edubuntu one). We hope to be able to do that in the next couple of months. For the longer term, we really want to continue our effort on spreading Ubuntu in France, which results in the organization of more parties all across the country (building on the success of the whole intrepid campaign). We want to have some regular events, where people can gather in real life instead of just in IRC. That should help the new user to feel that they are part of the community. It might be some bug jams, some documentation jams (like a bug jam but to verify the current available documentation), or even some translation jams. Finally we will try to set up a real policy for the attendance of events by offering people the chance to meet with the team personally to ask question and get answers.

- One of the ideas that you have talked about with the Lo``Co Council is twinning. What is that? And have you put it into practice yet?

Many meanings can be given to the twinning of Lo``Cos. The one I really care about is the help that a big Lo``Co, like the French one, can provide to a smaller one. That help could be experience, helping to plan some large scale campaign, or even donating some money to help them to get their event started. This is something that we faced at the beginning with our team, and without the financial involvement of some French members we couldn't have done many of the things we have. Since the French Lo``Co has more power now, it might be a great thing to help other teams to get a start. In fact it is quite close to some of the key concepts that lead to the creation of ubuntu-eu some years ago. Ubuntu-eu is a joint German effort to share hosting of their website. Since its inception, many Lo``Cos have found hosting there, which is clearly helpful for the newer teams. Back to the twinning process, we have started to work a bit on it, with the Tunesian Lo``Co, but we are not very far along in the process because of a lack of time lately. I am very confident that we will work on that soon again.

- The Ubuntu French Team had a release party attended by 4,000 people. Can you describe the event? How did you plan the event? How long did it take?

This event, that took place in Paris, was a mixture of all the various kind of parties that we could have: install, release, conference... That is why we simply call it an "Ubuntu Party." We are hosting this event every 6 months, on a weekend, about a month after each release. During the event, many people came to get an installation of Intrepid, or because they were facing a problem with their current ubuntu installation. We also offered more than 14 hours of conferences, and a bug jam... and even live radio during the whole weekend that was broadcasting from the event. The team has been planning the event since the end of the previous one(which was in early June), so it is the result of 6 months of work by the whole team. Some of us were working on the communication (with media, with the desired audience), some others on the materials needed for the event, or even planning the overall look and feel of the conference. We are currently doing the analysis of this event, which should help us to prepare the next one, in May 2009.

- What do you do for fun?

Besides my Lo``Co activities, I do some Ubuntu development. While I know it is still related to our community, this is clearly a separated activity from my point of view. But I also do quite a lot of sports: mainly basketball, but I also go hiking in the Pyrenees (some mountains which are very close to my home) sometimes. Beside that, I really enjoy cooking for my friends. In fact I clearly see a common link in cooking for others, and doing some of the activities associated with free software...

=== In The Press ===

* CDC takes its epidemiological software open source -  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have released an open-source version of its software for epidemiological analysis. According to Enrique Nieves Jr., acting division director of the National Center for Public Health Informatics’ Division of Integrated Surveillance Systems and Services, this move should open the door for the whole world to be our lab, which would bring in ideas from different places and maybe some contributions for features that we hadn’t thought of. CDC has tested Epi Info Community Edition on Ubuntu, a Linux-based operating system. He said the software has not been tested on any other Linux distribution. The reason they used Ubuntu, is it’s one of the most popular Linux distributions and one of the most user friendly. http://www.govhealthit.com/online/news/350715-1.html

* Netflix coming to Linux desktops? - Boxee is a new linux distro, a social media center that gives access to Netflix video downloads to Linux for the first time. Netflix users have been able to stream the subscription service's videos onto Windows for some time, while Macintosh desktops gained support within the last few weeks. However, the capability has never before been available for Linux desktops. A Mac OS X version of the Netflix release is available now, and an Ubuntu Linux version will be ready early next year. Boxee is available in alpha stage for Ubuntu Linux, but new users may have to wait several weeks. http://www.desktoplinux.com/news/NS8284021470.html

* Ubuntu Mobile Broadband Disappointment - Some time ago this author wrote about using mobile broadband with Ubuntu, and he was very hopeful at that time it would soon be "plug in and click to connect". Unfortunately it hasn't turned out that way, at least not yet. Considered in the light of his original goal, which was simply to get his Sierra Wireless Air Card 880 working with Ubuntu, it is still a major win, because now, he can do that. http://community.zdnet.co.uk/blog/0,1000000567,10009946o-2000498448b,00.htm

=== In The Blogosphere ===

* Is Linux ready for the average user? My wife thinks so - The author's wife has always used Windows machines, so it was with some fear and trembling that he purchased a Dell Mini 9 loaded with Ubuntu for her. After some setup, such as Japanese character input, and other minor things, he turned her loose with it. In the 3 weeks she's been on it he's not heard a single complaint. His conclusion: if he can get his wife to use Linux without complaint, then it's ready for anybody. http://okiiliving.blogspot.com/2008/12/is-linux-ready-for-average-user-my-wife.html

* System76 Launches Biometric Ubuntu Linux Laptop - Joe Panettieri, of Works``With``U, introduces the System76 Gazelle Ultra (starting at $899).  This laptop not only is strongly branded around Ubuntu, but sports a bio-metric fingerprint reader for security. The specs include:

** 13.3” LED Backlit Display (1280×800)
** Brushed Aluminum Palm Rest
** Latest Intel CPU’s
** Intel X4500HD Graphics
** Webcam
** Fingerprint Reader
** 4.4 lbs.

* Review: Za``Reason Makes Desktop Linux A Breeze - Joe Panettieri, of Works``With``U, shows people with aging computers alternatives to new, expensive, high-end equipment. The Za``Reason Breeze is a low-end machine running Ubuntu that has been designed for who just want basic desktop productivity applications, Web 2.0 applications, email and instant messaging.  Based on an Intel Atom processor, and costing only about $300, it fills that niche quite adequately. It should be noted that this computer will slow down with multiple multi-media applications running. http://www.workswithu.com/2008/12/12/review-zareason-makes-desktop-linux-a-breeze/

* New Notifications for Jaunty - awalton introduces us to the new notifications work that has been going on for the Jaunty Jack release. Based on information released at UDS (Ubuntu Developer Summit), the upstream development of notifications has stalled, however, Ubuntu and Canonical are doing some work to improve the situation. The direction that they are going in is to have the notifications just show what's happening on your machine, rather than having any actions button associated with them. Actions would, therefore, be moved to a panel applet. In a follow-up article called "Some notifications updates"[1], awalton goes on to explain some things that he got wrong in the original article, such as the legal conflict (just licensing issues) and the state of the code (bad, and just for demo).

==== OpenSolaris tackles Ubuntu dominance ====

Sun has crafted the second release of Open``Solaris with a number of improvements in an attempt to make it more competitive with desktop orientated Linux distributions such as Canonical's Ubuntu. Open``Solaris is Sun's open source version of the Solaris flavor of Unix, and is primarily aimed at workstations. As a relative newcomer to the open source world, however, the platform has lacked a broad selection of applications, and hardware support has been narrower than in competing Linux distributions such as Ubuntu. http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/software/soa/OpenSolaris-tackles-Ubuntu-dominance/0,130061733,339293697,00.htm
