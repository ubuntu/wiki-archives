==== Can these smartphone firms take on the big guys? ====

Kiran Moodley of CNBC writes about the innovations coming out of Mobile World Congress in Barcelona and quotes Canonical’s Jane Silber: "There has to be a window of disruption and opportunity," she said. "We think there's absolutely room for another player here...and there is real demand from OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) and operators for another option. They are increasingly pressured in an all-Android world and they don't have access to the Apple world." The report then goes into the software focus, price point of the proposed phones, and more.

==== New Unity Scopes Technology Detailed by Canonical ====

Joey-Elijah Sneddon of OMG! Ubuntu! writes about some of the changes being made in order to reach the goal of increasing “the breadth of discoverability through Scopes; the control users have over them; and improve the way in which data is presented through them.” Joey writes that “a new ‘dash toolkit‘ is being introduced that allows data to be displayed in new, flexible ways. For example, results for an image search would work best as large thumbnails in a carousel for browsing, while news snippets are more useful in list view, with a wider content area to display text.”
