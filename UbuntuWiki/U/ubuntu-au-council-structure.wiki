=== 1A. Meritocracy (current model) but with recognition of those already performing the duties. ===
This model is currently in use but not everyone is aware of what is being done behind the scenes to make everything work. There is also currently a need for a Chairperson type of role. This is not to say these roles are never rotated, in fact quite the opposite, they are ALREADY rotated. It's just that as some people find they have less time to do things others find they have more time and put their hand up. If you are regularly contributing to an area/s within the community you will find yourself IN one of these roles already if not on the radar should someone have a need to step away for a bit.

* Loco Contact - roles described <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LoCoTeamContact|here]]</nowiki>
* Chairperson - responsible for chairing and documenting regular meetings (doesn't have to do all the work just needs to make sure it gets done)
* Webteam (numbers dependent on changing requirements, suggest minimum of 3) - responsible for <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AustralianTeam/MailingLists|Ubuntu-AU mailing list moderation]]</nowiki>, administrating the <nowiki>[[www.ubuntu.com.au|Ubuntu-AU website]]</nowiki> and keeping the <nowiki>[[http://wiki.ubuntu.com/AustralianTeam/|Ubuntu-AU Wiki page]]</nowiki> up to date.

=== 2. Conventional Committee Model: Democratic ===
* Chairperson: Chairs meetings (driving discussion & Decisions)
* President: Serves as 'Loco Contact'
* Vice-President: Assists President
* Ordinary Members (4-6)
    '''Election:''' General (Annual or Bi-annual) Election by all Ubuntu-au Members
===== PROs =====
* Creates a process, with public responsibilities
===== CONs =====
* Elections & politicisation

* Each member in the City/Region has a say in appointing/electing representative.
===== CONs =====
* Election/Appointment Process 

=== 3B. State Council Representative ===
* A 'State council' would be created when there are 5 or more city/Regional representatives (in One state) on the ACC. 
* Cities/Regions would then elect/appoint representatives to the 'State council' rather than the ACC.
* A state representative, would then be appointed/elected to represent their respective state in the ACC.
