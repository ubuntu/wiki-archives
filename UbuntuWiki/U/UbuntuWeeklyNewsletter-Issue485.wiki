==== Paul White: More on bug reports, September 1973 and a jumping mouse ====

Paul White writes again about bug reports saying that vague and incomplete bug reports are of little to no use so he asks for them to include the version of Ubuntu Desktop used and as much information as possible which will help identify the package at fault. He says that many users that have filed bugs would have received better help had they gone first to the Ubuntu Forums, Ask Ubuntu, or Launchpad Answers. Paul provides a number of links for further reading on reporting bugs.

https://tribaal.io/making-lxd-fly-on-ubuntu-as-well.html

==== Stéphane Graber: Network Management with LXD (2.3+) ====

Stéphane Graber writes about LXD networking in 16.04. Originally networking was external to LXD, but there is now a networking management API in LXD 2.3. He provides an overview of the new networking capabilities, with commands used to enable, examine, attaching, using DHCP, DNS and tunnels. Stéphane also links to sites where more information can be found.

=== In The Press ===

==== Why the IoT security nightmare could be a dream for Ubuntu ====

Glyn Moody from Ars Technica writes about Mark Shuttleworth’s talk at OSCON in London about the Internet of Things (IoT). He highlights some facts on Mark’s slides, Snaps, and how that connects to IoT.

http://arstechnica.co.uk/business/2016/10/ubuntu-snap-packaging-internet-of-things-security/

==== Ubuntu 16.10: Yakkety Yak... Unity 8's not wack ====

Scott Gilbertson of The Register shares his in depth review of the newly released Ubuntu 16.10. He concludes that although the release is not without its faults (particularly the instability of Unity 8), users may yet wish to upgrade to the new release in order to take advantage of updates to the kernel, Software Center and GNOME packages.

http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/10/18/ubuntu_1610_review/

=== In The Blogosphere ===

==== Ubuntu 16.10 Desktop Gaming Benchmarks: Unity, GNOME, Xfce, LXDE, KDE, Openbox, MATE ====

Michael Larabel, writing for Phoronix, responds to requests for OpenGL benchmarks now that Ubuntu 16.10 has been released. He shows us the results after comparing Unity against six other desktop options and notes that the slowest, in an “out-of-the-box” configuration as packaged in Ubuntu, were Xfce and MATE.

http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=ubuntu-1610-desktops&num=1

==== Ubuntu 16.10 Review ====

Mike Johnson of CMS Critic shares his review of Ubuntu 16.10 with us noting that it is one of the easiest distributions to install but doesn’t look much different to previous releases. He says of the Unity 8 preview: “it is simply awful looking” and goes on to show us how it can be accessed. Mike goes on to review some of the updated applications and includes in his summary: “Overall, I'd say this felt like a typical Ubuntu release, at least from a desktop perspective.”

==== 7 Best Features Of Ubuntu 16.10 Yakkety Yak ====

Aditya Tiwari of Fossbytes takes quick look at the best features of Ubuntu 16.10 which updated versions of the kernel, nautilus, GNOME, an extra job for systemd, changes to GPG, a developer preview of Unity 8 and many updated applications. He reminds us that the release is supported for nine months and points us to where it can be downloaded from.

==== Canonical Ltd.'s Ubuntu Core ====

James Gray, writing for Linux Journal, gives us a summary of Ubuntu Core which he says Canonical describes as: “the ideal platform for developers in the semiconductor arena for deploying large numbers of IoT devices due to its secure and open-source design, transactional updates that are fast and reliable and its small footprint.” He informs us that the Uc``Robotics' Bubblegum-96 board is the latest addition to the list of supported devices.

==== Happy 12th Birthday, Ubuntu! ====

Joey-Elijah Sneddon of OMG! Ubuntu! reminds us that 12 years has passed since Mark Shuttleworth’s announcement of the release of Ubuntu 4.10 which was code-named Warty Warthog. He quotes from that announcement, highlights some of the features of the first release and ends by writing: “Ubuntu was a game-changer from the get-go. In the 12 years since that release the project has grown in almost every area, ambition, scale, innovation and popularity.”
