==== Precise Pangolin Alpha 1 Released! ====

Kate Stewart, Ubuntu Release Manager, announced on Thursday, December 1st that the Alpha 1 Precise Pangolin was released.

The announced reads as follows:

We are pleased to bring you the first set of developer images that capture the current fleeting reality of our Precise Pangolin (Ubuntu 12.04 Alpha 1) as it starts to emerge.

Pre-releases of Precise Pangolin are *not* encouraged for anyone needing a stable system or anyone who is not comfortable running into occasional, even frequent breakage.  They are, however, recommended for Ubuntu developers and those who want to help in testing, reporting, and fixing bugs as we work towards getting this LTS release ready.

Alpha 1 is the first in a series of milestone CD images that will be released throughout the Precise development cycle.  The Alpha images are known to be reasonably free of showstopper CD build or installer bugs, while representing a very recent snapshot of Precise.  You can download them here:

   http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/precise/alpha-1/
   (Ubuntu Desktop, Server, ARM)

Additional images are also available at:

   http://uec-images.ubuntu.com/releases/precise/alpha-1/ (Ubuntu Server Cloud and EC2)

   http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/xubuntu/releases/precise/alpha-1/ (Xubuntu)

=== LoCo News ===

==== Akademy FR at Capitole du Libre ====

Akademy FR, Ubuntu Party and Drupal Camp were co-located and held last weekend, November 26-27, 2011 in Toulouse, France.
The KDE team ran a booth and hosted tracks on Saturday noting that they were able to demo KDE to various Ubuntu users who weren’t familiar with it.  Sunday proved to be an equally eventful day with workshops that for the most part attracted attendees who were already familiar with Free Software.

==== Rick Spencer: Smoke Tests ====

Rick Spencer lets readers know that the QA Team has started a page for getting up the minute automated results from smoke testing of daily images. Spencer writes, “They still have more smoke tests to set up, but everything is running automatically from daily builds. You can check to see if the latest build installs and if basic tests run. If they do, it's probably worth testing with that build. If it's not, then the team should be busy at work at making it work testing!”

He also gives a link to the blueprint for the smoke tests results page.

==== Michael Hall: Reports of Ubuntu’s death are greatly exaggerated ====

Michael Hall questions whether or not Distrowatch’s data “is a measure of the “popularity” of any given distro, as so many news stories are claiming it is.”  Find out more about what Hall has to say on this subject at the link below.

==== David Planella: Building the Ubuntu App Development community (I): communication channels ====

“One of the main objectives for the Ubuntu 12.04 cycle is to build upon the foundations set by the Ubuntu App Developer site, My Apps and the Ubuntu Software Centre and start building an Ubuntu App Developer community to realize the vision of a rich ecosystem of apps around Ubuntu,” writes David Planella.  With this post, Planella launches the first of a series that will discuss growing the Ubuntu App Developer Community as he shows readers how to get involved, and the benefits of Ubuntu as a target platform for both developers and users.

==== Martin Pitt: Precises QA improvements for Alpha-1 ====

“The fruits of the new QA paradigm and strategy and the new Stable+1 maintenance team have already achieved remarkable results,” writes Martin Pitt who outlines in this post what some of those improvements are.  Improvements include:

* The archive consistency reports like component-mismatches, uninstallability, etc. now appear about 20 minutes earlier than in oneiric.
* CD image builds can now happen 30 minutes earlier after the publisher start, and are much quicker now due to moving to newer machines. We can now build an i386 or amd64 CD image in 8 minutes! Currently they still need to wait for the slow powerpc buildd, but moving to a faster machine there is in progress. These improvements lead to much faster image rebuild turnarounds.
* Candidate CDs now get automatically posted to the new ISO tracker as soon as they appear.
* Whenever a new Ubuntu image is built (daily or candidate), they automatically get smoke-tested, so we know that the installer works under some standard scenarios and produces an install which actually boots.
* Due to the new discipline and the stable+1 team, we had working daily ISOs pretty much every day. In previous Alphas, the release engineer(s) pretty much had to work fulltime for a day or two to fix the worst uninstallability etc., all of this now went away.

Pitt also take time to thank the Canonical QA team and others for all their work to date.

http://mknadeem.blogspot.com/2011/11/ubuntu-1110-explored.html

==== Fedora 16 vs. Ubuntu 11.10 Performance Benchmarks ====

Michael Larabel, Phoronix, gives readers “a comparison of the 64-bit performance of Ubuntu 11.10 vs. Fedora 16 in an out-of-the-box configuration.”

Larabel writes, “ When it comes to these benchmarks, what's worth noting is that Fedora 16 and Ubuntu 11.10 are both on GCC 4.6.x and the EXT4 file-system. Some of the important differences though is that Fedora 16 is on the Linux 3.1 kernel while Ubuntu 11.10 is on Linux 3.0 and Fedora 16 has a more recent (both user and kernel-space) graphics stack. There's also various other differences from the Linux operating systems from Canonical and Red Hat.”

==== Work Is Underway on Ubuntu TV, with Mark Shuttleworth Watching ====

In this post Dean gives links to both Mark Shuttleworth’s blog and Alan Bell’s proposed designs.

Dean concludes this post with a prediction that readers will see an Ubuntu-based TV platform arrive next year.

==== Ubuntu’s One Hundred Paper Cuts Project is Precisely Back! ====

Bilal Akhtar lets OMG! Ubuntu! readers know that the popular One Hundred Paper Cuts project is back.  In this article, Akhtar and http://wiki.ubuntu.com/PaperCut describe a the paper cut project as:

Put briefly, a paper cut is a trivially fixable usability bug that the average user would encounter in a default application of Ubuntu or Kubuntu OR in any of the featured applications.

If you prefer a more detailed, itemized definition, a paper cut is:
* A bug, or an unintended problem occurring within an existing piece of software,
* the presence of which makes a computer more difficult or less pleasant to use,
* that is easy to fix,
* that the average user would encounter,
* in a default application of the Ubuntu or Kubuntu release currently under development OR in any of the featured applications.

==== Mythbuntu: Mythbuntu guides moved to AskUbuntu.com! ====

The Mythubuntu team announces that they have moved their guides to Ask``Ubuntu.com.  According to the team’s blog post the reason given for this move is for a more efficient method to keep guides up to date and accurate. “The single forum post with all the guides is difficult to keep up to date and requires manual intervention from the Mythbuntu forum moderators (Mythbuntu developers). There isn't an automated way to take care of this. Moving to Ask``Ubuntu.com for this enables us to have an auto-generated list of Mythbuntu/MythTV related guides.”

==== Lubuntu 11.10 review: Lightweight Linux ====

Rohan Pearce, Techworld Australia, writes, “For some people, this may be the best Ubuntu derivative yet. For others, it’s going to be pretty snore-worthy.”

Pearce reviews Lubuntu--lightweight and energy saving variant of Ubuntu using LXDE-- in this post and even comments, “... there is strong, vibrant community surrounding the Ubuntu derivatives”

“Lubuntu gets a lot of things right, especially given it’s a relatively new addition to the Ubuntu family. It’s just really hard to get excited about it and it’s a distro I’d be unlikely to use personally,” concludes Pearce.

For the full review see the link below.

==== The End of the Distro Wars ====

Brian Profitt, IT World, starts this article by saying, “Don't use Distro``Watch as a measuring stick in any way for the popularity of a Linux distribution.” And even follows with a, “Seriously, stop it.”
Profitt says, “Arguing about "popular" distributions is pointless.”
