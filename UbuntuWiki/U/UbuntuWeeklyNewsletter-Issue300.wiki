=== General Community News ===

==== Happy 300th Issue of UWN ====

UWN has evolved to its current form with the help of many throughout the Ubuntu Community.  The dedication, commitment, and passion the Ubuntu News Team has for ensuring that the community has a place to turn for a summary of each week of Ubuntu is amazing. Many thanks especially to Elizabeth Krumbach, Nathan Handler and others for automating much of a time consuming manual process. Thanks go out to the summary writers, reviewers and our social media guru Jasna Benčić.  Thank you to everyone who supports UWN either by contributing or consuming!  Here is to another 300 issues and to Ubuntu in all its many forms!

“Congratulations to the Ubuntu Weekly Newsletter team (past, present and future) for reaching the milestone 300th edition!  UWN is a meaningful summary of the wide-ranging activities in the Ubuntu community and provides a valuable guide to the project, no matter what your level of involvement.  I read it nearly every week on the wiki, skimming the table of contents and then jumping to the sections that catch my eye - usually that's the windows into the community such as Lo``Co News, Ubuntu Cloud News, and the Planet and blogosphere wrap up.  UWN usefully and accurately captures the vast and fast-paced community activities in way that you can't find in other publications.  Thanks to everyone who has contributed to UWN over the years - your support for Ubuntu and for the readers who rely on your work to understand what's happening in the Ubuntu community is legendary!” '''~ Jane Silber, Canonical CEO'''

“I read every section! The ones I pay the most attention to are the Lo``Co news, General community news and blogosphere and news articles. As a marketing team we pay attention to the Ubuntu articles in the press but I often find one that I hadn't seen. And, although I read planet, the Lo``Co news and community news is a great round-up of things that I wouldn't see without UWN. UWN is a fantastic resource because it shows the width and range of things that are happening in the Ubuntu world. Even though I'm probably more informed than most about what's happening in Ubuntu I always learn new things. I'm sure every reader is the same! I'd really like to thank everyone for taking part to create UWN - both the writers and the news contributors. You're really helping Ubuntu and Free Software by providing an easy way for anyone to get the latest news and happenings in the Ubuntu family. It's a great resource for finding out all the rich activity that's taking place every week in some part of the Ubuntu community.” '''~ Steve George, VP Operations, Canonical'''

"Congratulations on your 300th issue!  What an accomplishment.  Thank you to the UWN news team for all of your hard work.  It's collaboration and efforts like this that make the Ubuntu community so amazing.  Keep up the great work and cheers to your continued success." '''~ Leann Ogasawara, Ubuntu Kernel Team Manager, Canonical'''

“Congratulations to the Ubuntu News Team for pushing the Ubuntu Weekly Newsletter (UWN) to the 300th issue!!! UWN is a very good source for obtaining the newest information in the community of Ubuntu and Linux. If you want to see what the different teams are doing, or what sorts of new features are implemented, UWN is  tailor-made for providing such news. I check into Ubuntu Weekly Newsletter every  time I received it through Gmail, normally watching out the "Welcome new member and developers" (to congratulate the people who got a membership) and "The Planet" (where the newest features and team news can be found mainly). Thanks to everybody who contributed to UWN for this great newsletter, especially to Elizabeth Krumbach, Nathan Handler and other editors. Thank you UWN!” '''~ smartboy UWN Subscriber'''

"I have helped on and off for several years with the publishing of the Ubuntu Weekly Newsletter. I also created several scripts to make the process easier and faster for everyone involved. Even with these scripts, preparing an issue of the newsletter still requires a significant amount of time each week from many volunteers. However, these volunteers understand the impact their work has on the greater Ubuntu community. Programmers, packagers, documentation writers, graphic artists, and general Ubuntu members all read and use the Ubuntu Weekly Newsletter to keep up-to-date on what is going on in the community. Everyone who has ever contributed to an issue of the newsletter should feel proud in knowing that they made an important contribution to Ubuntu. I look forward to reading and helping us reach issue 400." ''' ~Nathan Handler, Ubuntu Member and UWN Editor'''

"I've been working with the Ubuntu News team since 2010 and took up primary coordinator of issue releases in mid 2011. In this time I've worked with dozens of amazing people, including Nathan Handler who I worked with to make the release process much more streamlined with our amusing collection of Perl and Python scripts, Jasna Benčić who works hard to not only collect articles throughout the week, but also acts as summary writer, editor and social media guru, Amber Graner who has been happy to pitch in with releases on weeks when I'm traveling and Jim Connett and Matt Rudge who I've come to rely upon for editorial review each week. Finally, it's always a pleasure to meet and chat with our readers and the feedback I've received at random conferences and events I attend has been essential to improvements we've made over these past couple years. Thank you to everyone for making us what we are today and happy 300th issue!" '''~ Elizabeth Krumbach, UWN Editor'''
