The formidable Ubuntu Venezuela team delivered an event to follow up on the successful run on FLISOL 2009. The name of the event is UBUNTAZO (Ubuntu Blast). It was held Saturday May 23rd and it featured a set of talk that shared basic knowledge on basic Ubuntu daily usage and fostered participation in the community through joining the Ubuntu-ve team.

It was held at the Simon Rodriguez Public Library in the center of Caracas, Venezuela and over 60 people came to share experiences with the ubuntu-ve community in Caracas. Thanks to the invaluable support from the people at Simon Rodriguez Library. Ubuntazo is scheduled for a second round this upcoming June 27th for more check the Ubuntu wiki page

Special Thanks to Nelson Delgado, Cecilia Calabria, Andres Thieles, Jaime Escobar, Camilo Torres, Juan Hernandez Enrique Carpenter, Kathie Quintero, Reina Escobar y Jean Piero Lombardo for organizing such great event for the community to share and for keeping the spirit of Ubuntu alive and kicking.

=== Ubuntu Forums News ===

==== Tutorial of the Week ====

June 8, 2009

This week we are highlighting a thread that has been active and supported by frodon (http://ubuntuforums.org/member.php?u=23970) since October 20, 2005! This comprehensive "HOWTO : Create a FTP server with user access (proftpd)" is for you if you are willing to share files with friends over FTP protocol with proftpd, with username/password features (so only people you gave access will be able to get the files). Encryption is also detailed. Please do not hesitate to ask questions in the thread, frodon is always around to help people out.

=== In The Press ===

==== ARM-powered smartbook running Ubuntu ====

Geek.com's Sal Cangeloso asks what happens when you drop Intel and x86 and throw on Ubuntu? How does 10 hours of life from a 3-cell battery sound? The system even plays some light video. It doesn’t have the power of an Atom netbook, but it is still sufficient for basic browsing. The Wistron N900z runs a 800MHz Freescale processor, has 4GB of SSD storage, and packs a 10-inch display. The system might sell for as little as $200, possibly less. The move to ARM processors will mean a drop in performance, but for people using these machines as they are intended they could be an inexpensive alternative to today’s netbooks. http://www.geek.com/articles/chips/wistron-n900z-arm-powered-smartbook-running-ubuntu-2009063/

==== SanDisk Ships Next-Generation SSDs ====

tradingmarkets.com reports that San``Disk Corp. announced that it has begun shipping its next-generation flash memory-based solid state drives (SSD) for netbooks. San``Disk pSSD P2 and S2 employ a new technology called nCache, which it said improves netbook performance. Engineers from San``Disk and Canonical have worked on system optimizations for the Gen2 pSSD, resulting in improved system responsiveness and longer battery life. "Canonical is enabling original equipment manufacturers and designers to offer consumers a fantastic user experience with Ubuntu Netbook Remix running on netbooks," said Chris Kenyon, director of OEM services at Canonical. "Our tests have shown San``Disk second generation pSSD equipped with nCache performing significantly better than a 5400 RPM HDD, providing Ubuntu users with the speed and stability that they need." http://www.tradingmarkets.com/.site/news/Stock%20News/2363284/

==== Get a Linux-powered Dell laptop for $299 ====

C``Net's Rick Broida exclaims "Zowie! For less than the price of some Netbooks, you can get yourself a full-blown Dell notebook. Here's the deal: Dell is offering the Inspiron 15n for just $299." The real consideration for most buyers is that the Inspiron 15n runs on Ubuntu Linux 8.10--a great operating system by all accounts. Everything about the Inspiron is rock solid, including its 2GB of RAM, 160GB hard drive, DVD burner, and 15.6-inch wide-screen LCD. You also get a four-cell battery and one-year warranty. Broida wishes he could say that you'll get out the door for $299, but Dell charges $29 for shipping, and you may have to pay sales tax as well. Even so, this is a fantastic bargain for anyone seeking a full-fledged notebook at a Netbook price. http://news.cnet.com/8301-13845_3-10258138-58.html

==== Ubuntu Becomes Intel's Classmate ====

EFYtimes.com tells us that Canonical has reached an agreement with Intel Corporation to deliver Ubuntu as an operating system for the Intel-powered classmate PCs. The new Intel-powered classmate PC features a larger screen, more memory and larger SSD or HDD than the original classmate PC. and it will also feature a modified version of Ubuntu Netbook Remix. “Not only is this a significant step for an open operating system, it is a significant step for any device to be able to offer these capabilities, at this cost, on standardized hardware,” said Jon Melamut, general manager of Canonical's OEM services. “Our goal has always been to take the best technology and make it available to everyone. Coupling our software with a fantastic, affordable education device like this is a concrete realization of that ambition.” http://www.efytimes.com/efytimes/fullnews.asp?edid=34950&magid=13

==== Judgment Day: Studio Dave Tests Ubuntu Studio 9.04 ====

Linux Journal's Dave Phillips says he needs at least one i386 installation at "Studio Dave" because some production software is not yet 64-bit ready, and he happens to need that software. He experienced some difficulties with some of his hardware, but managed to get his system upgraded to Ubuntu 9.04 after consulting the Ubuntu Forums. Phillips says he has only started to dip into the various goodies provided by the Ubuntu Studio meta packages, and thanks to the currency of the system he can build and test the latest Ardour3 as well as many other applications that require up-to-date graphics and audio components. "Performance-wise this system is now a beauty." http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/judgement-day-studio-dave-tests-ubuntu-studio-904

==== Linux Makes the Grade in California Schools ====

Jacqueline Emigh of Linux.com says that a few growing pains aside, a Linux deployment in a Santa Rosa, CA elementary school district is maturing robustly, letting teachers and students stand apart from their previous dependence on Microsoft Windows while they try on new open software attitudes. The transition in Santa Rosa from Windows NT 4 to Ubuntu Linux Terminal Server Project might not get an A+ mark based strictly on smoothness, suggested Jordan Erickson, but overall, the Linux deployment is ranking highly with the seven schools involved, because it saves them money on Microsoft licenses, spares them from Windows upgrades, prevents computer viruses, and spurs greater collaboration. For the sake of underlying stability, Santa Rosa has been sticking with the Long Term Support versions of Canonical’s Ubuntu Linux, beginning with Ubuntu 6.04 and migrating along to 8.04, the current deployment. Beyond slashing the costs of Microsoft licenses, taking giant steps away from Windows permits the schools to hold on to their software investments. Particularly with LTS versions of Ubuntu, older software "doesn’t stop getting supported, the way it does in Windows. Schools these days just don’t have all that much to spend. They can apply the money they save from LTSP to other needs, such as books." http://www.linux.com/news/enterprise/case-studies/16798-linux-makes-the-grade-in-california-schools

==== Canonical announces support for Moblin v2 ====

At Computex in Taipei Canonical announced support of Moblin, an optimized open source Linux software stack and application framework, by committing to the development of a product based on the recently released Moblin v2 for Intel® Atom™ processor-based platforms. Moblin v2 provides the core infrastructure, applications and user experience that Canonical will integrate into an Ubuntu-based product. "We are very excited about bringing a Moblin v2-based product to market in the near future,” said Mark Shuttleworth, founder of the Ubuntu project. “Intel’s Atom processor along with the Linux Foundation bring fantastic energy and excitement to OEMs looking to deliver Linux-based experiences for users through Moblin. Adding it as an option alongside Ubuntu, and eventually sharing elements between the two, means even more rapid innovation on open platforms which will benefit developers, manufacturers and, most importantly, users.” http://www.ubuntu.com/news/canoical-commits-ubuntu-moblin

=== In The Blogosphere ===

==== Ubuntu and Moblin Linux to work together ====

Blogger Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols from Computer World informs us of some of the big news that has come out of the Computex trade show in Taipei Taiwan. First that Canonical will be announcing partnerships with Intel, San``Disk, and Real``Networks. The biggest news being Canonical's plan to demonstrate the Moblin version of Ubuntu Netbook Remix or UNR. He also lets us know of Canonical's plan to make the full version of Moblin 2 available by year's end. We are then given an overview of the Ubuntu Netbook Remix. It's a slimmed down version of Ubuntu 8.04 that's designed to run on the limited hardware of netbooks. The difference with Moblin that he points out, is that it will be using the Moblin interface instead of UNR's default launcher. He leaves us with Canonical's plan to announce the results of new work with San``Disk, and Real``Networks plan to announce the availability of its Real Player for Ubuntu. http://blogs.computerworld.com/ubuntu_and_moblin_linux_to_work_together

==== CPU Diversification: Ubuntu’s Gain, Microsoft’s Loss ====

Blogger Christopher Tozzi from Works``With``U tells us the benefits to Ubuntu and Linux in general of the growing diversity in processor architectures. He informs us that with Microsoft and Apple sticking with the x86 architecture for now, it opens up many different chipsets that they won't support. He then points out that the support for ARM and other alternative architectures haven't been officially released for Ubuntu yet, but that unofficial builds are out there. Christopher Tozzi informs us that even with Microsoft trying to grab hold of the netbook market with Windows 7, Ubuntu will still gain ground as more and more of the netbooks out there use ARM and other alternative CPUs. http://www.workswithu.com/2009/06/03/cpu-diversification-ubuntus-gain-microsofts-loss/
