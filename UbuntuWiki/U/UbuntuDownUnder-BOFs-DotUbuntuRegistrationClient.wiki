=== Introduction ===

There will be a requirement for a number of applications to be able to talk in a sensible manner to Launchpad and the Ubuntu service infrastructure, including bug reporting to Malone, HCT, shtoom VoIP client and so on.

=== Rationale ===

It would be very useful for one simple application to create all the requisite configuration for these clients and to create a username and password in launchpad.

=== Scope and Use Cases ===

 1. Jane installs Ubuntu and wishes to talk to her friend John using VoIP. She knows he has a dotUbuntu account, so she registers with the dotUbuntu client and then calls him

 1. Jeff wishes to use hct to manage his Ubuntu packages as part of his MOTU work. He also needs to work with Malone. He registers with dotUbuntu and can then start work with Launchpad.

 1. Jim wishes to use bazaar with launchpad and the supermirror. He registers with dotUbuntu and can then work with BazaarLaunchpadClient 
 
=== Implementation Plan ===

Use `gnome-about-me` and extend it with a new tab for dotUbuntu.  This will also buy us the missing GUI for password changing.

The client will also need to be taught how to generate the requisite dot-files for the various dependent programs such as shtoom.

==== Data Preservation and Migration ====
 
 N/A

==== Packages Affected ====

* new dotUbuntu registration client
* programs that wish to hook into the client should deliver sample dotfiles into a well known location
* launchpad needs to provide an account creation interface over HTTP.

==== User Interface Requirements ====

* Addition of dotUbuntu tab to gnome-about-me.
