[00:01] <ClassBot> Logs for this session will be available at http://irclogs.ubuntu.com/2011/01/30/%23ubuntu-classroom.html following the conclusion of the session.
[00:02] <cprofitt> hello all
[00:05] <cprofitt> We are going to discuss - Switching to Ubuntu
[00:05] <cprofitt> There are really two 'ways' of doing this...
[00:05] <cprofitt> 1)  Leave your former OS and use only Ubuntu
[00:06] <cprofitt> 2) gradually changing from your other OS to Ubuntu
[00:07] <cprofitt> I am going to make the assumption that most would want to take option 2 as the first one can be fairly frightening
[00:07] <cprofitt> in both cases the first step would be to back up your data... your data can not be re-installed like an OS can
[00:07] <cprofitt> so make sure you have that backed up.
[00:08] <cprofitt> if you are running Windows 7 you can actually backup your data and your OS (in case you want to go back)
[00:10] <cprofitt> in other cases you can simple copy your data files over to an external storage device; hard drive or usb memory stick
[00:10] <cprofitt> any question yet at this point?
[00:11] <cprofitt> ok... moving on
[00:12] <cprofitt> once you have your backup complete you will want to decide -- full Linux, dual environment or virtual environment
[00:12] <cprofitt> both of the later two allow you to use both operating systems
[00:12] <cprofitt> a virtual environment will allow you to use both at the same time
[00:12] <cprofitt> this is the method many of us choose when we have applications that can not be replaced that run only in Windows
[00:13] <cprofitt> I want to stress that such applications are rare for home users, but they do exist... or in some cases you may prefer a Windows application to its alternatives
[00:14] <cprofitt> the only applications that can not run in a virtual environment are most Windows games (they require 3d acceleration) and some multimedia applications that also make use of direct3D functionality like Movie Maker
[00:15] <cprofitt> good examples of software that can be used inside a virtual environment are Active Directory management tools, VMWare Management tools, tax software and numerous others
[00:16] <cprofitt> If you need applications that require hardware 3d acceleration you will want a dual boot solution and not a virtual solution
[00:16] <cprofitt> A one hour block is too small to go in to the complete details
[00:16] <cprofitt> but here is a link to a set of instructions for dual booting
[00:16] <cprofitt> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot
[00:17] <cprofitt> you can also ask for assistance in #ubuntu-beginners
[00:17] <cprofitt> here is another wiki page about dual booting
[00:17] <cprofitt> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DualBootMigration
[00:18] <cprofitt> the one recommendation I do have is that if you have Windows 7 or Vista that you should use the built-in partition editor (Windows) to resize your Windows partition
[00:18] <cprofitt> there is a lower chance of an issue
[00:19] <cprofitt> The best write up I have seen for using Windows to resize your partition is here
[00:19] <cprofitt> http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/resize-a-partition-for-free-in-windows-vista/
[00:20] <cprofitt> Another option is to use that does not require a repartion is using Wubi
[00:20] <cprofitt> instructions for this can be found here
[00:20] <cprofitt> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide
[00:21] <cprofitt> Wubi actually loads inside of Windows and takes care of installing Ubuntu
[00:21] <cprofitt> for virtualization you have two options
[00:22] <cprofitt> run Ubuntu as a guest on Windows
[00:22] <cprofitt> or run Windows as a guest on Ubuntu
[00:22] <cprofitt> personally, as a Microsoft Systems Administrator by day, I prefer to run Windows as my guest
[00:23] <cprofitt> Ubuntu takes less memory and I feel much more secure being able to control my firewall with Linux than the other way around
[00:23] <cprofitt> in both cases I would recommend using VirtualBox
[00:23] <cprofitt> Mostly because VirtualBox is cross platform
[00:23] <cprofitt> http://www.virtualbox.org/
[00:24] <cprofitt> regardless of how you choose to take that first step... your next step will be trying to be 'productive' in your new OS environment
[00:24] <cprofitt> one of the sites that helped me evaluate 'alternative' applications was Linux App Finder
[00:25] <cprofitt> http://linuxappfinder.com/alternatives
[00:25] <cprofitt> if you were using FOSS apps on Windows you will likely be able to just install the same applications on Ubuntu, but if you were in the jail cell with the proprietary apps you will find the site very useful
[00:27] <cprofitt> the site has multiple applications for each proprietary application and when you click on the app you are presented with a page that gives you a description, a rating (if it has been rated), a link to the app's website and if the application is in the repositories
[00:27] <cprofitt> repositories...
[00:27] <cprofitt> wondering what they are?
[00:27] <cprofitt> repositories are what inspired Apple to build the 'app store'
[00:28] <cprofitt> repositories contain multiple applications that are able to be installed on your computer without fear of getting a trojan or malware
[00:28] <cprofitt> In Ubuntu in is called the Ubuntu SOftware Center
[00:28] <cprofitt> which is also a great place to just browse for applications
[00:29] <cprofitt> maybe even find some great ones that you would not have known about
[00:29] <cprofitt> the best part... no expense to try them
[00:29] <cprofitt> palhmbs> QUESTION: Is it better to start with an older Ubuntu version if my machine is low spec?
[00:30] <cprofitt> palhmbs: I would say no. If you machine is too low spec to run the full Ubuntu I would try a up-to-date version of one of the low spec alternatives
[00:31] <cprofitt> lubuntu, xubuntu or even use the alternative installer and carefully choose the components you want
[00:31] <cprofitt> if your version is too far back it will not be official supported...
[00:31] <cprofitt> updates, etc...
[00:31] <cprofitt> LTS versions, on the desktop, are supported for two years
[00:32] <cprofitt> it will all depend on what you want to do and how 'low' your computer specs really are
[00:33] <cprofitt> if you have a low spec machine and want to learn a lot about Ubuntu I would recommend the alternate installer
[00:33] <cprofitt> once you have installed Ubuntu you will certainly run in to issues...
[00:34] <cprofitt> do not let those bumps get you down... all OSes have bumps
[00:34] <cprofitt> in fact problems with Ubuntu are what made me discover the best part about Ubuntu
[00:34] <cprofitt> the community... and the depth of support and the willingness of that community to help me
[00:35] <cprofitt> there was never any RTFM or insults about how foolish my questions were
[00:35] <cprofitt> the support also does not cost you $300 per incident like Microsoft suport does
[00:35] <cprofitt> with Ubuntu you have the following places for support
[00:35] <cprofitt> http://askubuntu.com/
[00:36] <cprofitt> http://ubuntuforums.org/
[00:36] <cprofitt> https://help.ubuntu.com/
[00:36] <cprofitt> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/
[00:37] <cprofitt> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/
[00:38] <cprofitt> AskUbuntu is realtively new, but it has the great feature of having the 'best' answer (voted on by those using AskUbuntu) at the top right underneath the question
[00:38] <cprofitt> The forums have fantastic tutorials
[00:38] <cprofitt> http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=100
[00:39] <cprofitt> and a forum area just for beginners who are making the transition like you
[00:39] <cprofitt> http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=326
[00:39] <cprofitt> if you are a programmer there is an area for you as well
[00:39] <cprofitt> http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=39
[00:40] <cprofitt> I will not link the rest, but you have areas for Apple users, networking, multimedia, security, server platforms...
[00:40] <cprofitt> the forums are a truly excellent source of information
[00:40] <cprofitt> and getting to know your fellow Ubuntu users
[00:40] <cprofitt> if you want live support you can seek people out on IRC
[00:41] <cprofitt> just like you might be right now
[00:41] <cprofitt> You can also see if there is an active Local Community Team in your area
[00:41] <cprofitt> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LoCoTeams
[00:42] <cprofitt> Local teams may even run 'install fests' in your area to assist with the installation of your Ubuntu system
[00:42] <cprofitt> a great place to find out about activities going on with your LoCo is the LoCo Team Directory
[00:42] <cprofitt> http://loco.ubuntu.com/
[00:43] <cprofitt> just select your continent and then your specific loco
[00:43] <cprofitt> you will then have a list of activities
[00:43] <cprofitt> you can take a look at my loco for an example
[00:43] <cprofitt> http://loco.ubuntu.com/teams/ubuntu-newyork
[00:43] <cprofitt> If there is no active Loco you could also seek out a Linux User Group
[00:45] <cprofitt> I do want to ensure that you are aware that if you seek help on the forums or in IRC that you may not get instant answers
[00:45] <cprofitt> in IRC channels many people 'idle' so they can see questions even when they are away
[00:46] <cprofitt> if you can afford to stay in the channel and wait they will reply when they are 'back' and active in the channel
[00:46] <cprofitt> for the new Ubuntu user that is unfamiliar this can be a bit 'frustrating' at times...
[00:47] <cprofitt> but trust me it is much better than going through the automated attendant phone systems you fave with proprietary vendors
[00:47] <cprofitt> in general you need to plan on making a real committment to learning the new OS, the new apps and getting past some of the learning hurdles
[00:48] <cprofitt> I promise you it will be worth it in the end
[00:48] <cprofitt> I have been able to replace every application I used in Windows for personal use
[00:48] <cprofitt> and only use Windows in a VirtualBox session at work because I manage a 7200 user Microsoft environment
[00:49] <cprofitt> there have been some questions about system specs...
[00:50] <cprofitt> I would say that if you were able to run WindwsXP SP 3, Vista or 7
[00:50] <cprofitt> you will be able to run Ubuntu
[00:50] <cprofitt> if your machine struggled to run XP SP3 and was stuck on SP2 or prior you will have to look at some of the low sys requirement alternatives
[00:51] <cprofitt> any questions as we near the hour?
[00:51] <cprofitt> if not I want to just let you know about Ubuntu One....
[00:51] <ClassBot> There are 10 minutes remaining in the current session.
[00:51] <cprofitt> Ubuntu one is built in to Ubuntu and it allows you to synchronize your files to the 'cloud'
[00:52] <cprofitt> and it can keep them in sync with multiple computers or allow them to be shared with others
[00:52] <cprofitt> http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/features#one
[00:53] <cprofitt> I would like to welcome any potential new Ubuntu users to come and ask the Ubuntu Beginners Team questions as well
[00:53] <cprofitt> we are in #ubuntu-beginners (for questions) and #ubuntu-beginners-team (get to know us)
[00:54] <cprofitt> we can also help you when you are ready to 'give back' to the community when you are ready
[00:54] <cprofitt> oops... double the when you are ready part :-)
[00:54] <cprofitt> I also, to setup the next session, want to tell you that Ubuntu is not difficult
[00:54] <cprofitt> each of my children started using Ubuntu at the age of three...
[00:55] <cprofitt> and each never got frustrated except when our ISP was down and they could not get to the Internet
[00:55] <cprofitt> they LOVE Ubuntu
[00:55] <cprofitt> and I think you will as well!!
[00:56] <ClassBot> There are 5 minutes remaining in the current session.
[00:57] <cprofitt> One last recommendation -- make sure you attend classroom sessions like this...
[00:57] <cprofitt> and learn how to use IRC... as it is a great communication tool for getting help and meeting fellow Ubuntu users
[00:58] <cprofitt> Thanks everyone...
[00:59] <cprofitt> I hope the session helped you as your progress with transitioning from Windows to Ubuntu.
