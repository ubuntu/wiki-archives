==== UDS: How to participate even if you aren't attending ====

UDS begins this week in Dallas, TX and it's going to be another rockin' kickoff for a new Ubuntu release. Lucid Lynx is will be in heavy discussion for the developers and community at large.

Remote participation is encouraged, via IRC, Lifestream, Gobby and Live Stream. There are a number of EXTRA channels to join as each room at the venue will have a different track topic in it every hour. So it’s not by Stream type so you do have to keep an eye on the time table. I’m posting today so you know in advance. The Overall discussion, including plenary: #ubuntu-devel-summit on freenode.

Discussion Channels – The tracks are shuffled around different rooms, so the irc channels are /per room/, not per track. Here are the channels, which corresponds to the room of the session in the schedule.

* #ubuntu-uds-waverly
* #ubuntu-uds-stanford
* #ubuntu-uds-madison
* #ubuntu-uds-esmeralda
* #ubuntu-uds-mayflower
* #ubuntu-uds-riviere
* #ubuntu-uds-vinoy
* #ubuntu-uds-presidente
* #ubuntu-uds-riogrande
* #ubuntu-uds-lonestar1
* #ubuntu-uds-lonestar2
* #ubuntu-uds-lonestar3
* #ubuntu-uds-alamo1
* #ubuntu-uds-alamo2

For Icecast – see the link here: http://icecast.ubuntu.com/

A stream of all Ubuntu and UDS posts made to Identi.ca, Twitter, and Flickr can be found at http://summit.ubuntu.com/media/lifestream.html or if you just want to follow a certain track here is a list of them

* @udscommunity: http://identi.ca/udscommunity
* @udskernel: http://identi.ca/udskernel
* @udsqa: http://identi.ca/udsqa
* @udsfoundations: http://identi.ca/udsfoundations
* @udsmobile: http://identi.ca/udsmobile
* @udsdesktop: http://identi.ca/udsdesktop
* @udsserver: http://identi.ca/udsserver

Gobby is an on line editor that allows any number of participants to add, edit or delete content to a document. Gobby is being used at UDS to collaborate on the specifications that are being written and to facilitate remote participation. To take part, please install Gobby (available in universe) and tell it to connect to gobby.ubuntu.com. You will be presented with a list of documents being edited. During any session or meeting, and particularly at the end of one, please do make a local backup of your documents. WARNING: There is a new gobby in karmic, gobby-infinote, we will NOT be using this at UDS since we need for people on older releases to participate. Ensure you are using the “gobby” package.

One other thing, on freenode you are limited to joining a maximum of 20 IRC channels. If you need to join more you need to join #freenode and ask a staff member there to allow you to join 20+. UDS schedule can be found here: http://summit.ubuntu.com/uds-l/

==== Lucid translation imports are now active ====

Thanks to the wonderful job the Launchpad Translations team has been doing in the last few months it is now much easier to open translations for a new release. Therefore we're pleased to announce that translation imports have now been enabled for Lucid.

This means that packages uploaded to Lucid will have their translations stripped and put in the imports queue straight away. In this way, they will be processed much earlier and it will avoid backlogs of imports as it's been the case in some previous releases.

Translations will still not be visible to translators in the web UI. The team would like to at least wait until the first round of imports has been done and do some clean-up of the templates.

In that respect, there are two points they would like to discuss with the UTC team:

* Making translations visible: I'd like to get some feedback on when you think it would be best to make translations visible on the web UI. This time we can do it straight away much earlier than usual, and I'd like to hear your thoughts on that. They've got message sharing in place, which means that translations done in Lucid will make it into Karmic and vice versa, but if they open translations early will also mean that those teams not working closely with upstreams might start working on translations before the upstream teams, leading to a potential duplication of work.

* Translation templates and the imports queue. In order to allow the imports queue to be more automated and require less manual maintenance, it would be very useful to document the cases in which automatic imports do not work before the queue starts getting full. This way the Launchpad Translations developers will be able to improve or cater for those cases. To that purpose, Arne has started a wiki page to coordinate this effort [1]. I would encourage you to follow the instructions there to contribute to a more automated imports process.

==== Edubuntu Council Elections ====

As you may have noticed, the Edubuntu project has been going through some big changes recently. Something they have been working on with the Ubuntu Community Council for a while now is to have the Edubuntu Council back to a reasonable size (5 members).

That's why, today, they are announcing that there will be an election for new Edubuntu Council members. Jordan Mantha will be resigning from his Edubuntu Council position due to time constraints from his new job. The two remaining members, Jonathan Carter and Stéphane Graber will be running for re-election.

How will the election work:

* First week (#47, next week), they'll be taking candidates on the following wiki page: https://wiki.edubuntu.org/Edubuntu/Council/Election

* On the week after (#48), the Ubuntu Community Council will set-up a vote where all edubuntu-members will be asked to vote and choose the 5 candidates they want as Edubuntu Council members.

* Early on the week after that (#49), the 5 new Edubuntu Council members will be announced by the Ubuntu Community Council and be added to the Launchpad team.

During the election process, the current Edubuntu council remains as it currently is.

Ubuntu members will be able to make nominations by adding themselves to the https://wiki.edubuntu.org/Edubuntu/Council/Election or propose a candidate anonymously by contacting an Edubuntu Council member who will add that person the wiki page. The Edubuntu Council will then forward the list of nominees to the Community Council.

The Community Council will set up a vote for Edubuntu Members and announce the results of the election. In the case where the new Edubuntu Council member is not an Edubuntu Member, they will  receive Edubuntu Membership concurrently. Edubuntu council elections will occur annually, existing members may re-apply.

==== New York State Release Celebration ====

The New York State Ubuntu Community held their Karmic Release Event on Sunday. They had an awesome event once their first speaker actually showed up, about an hour late. They had two talks about FOSS and Ubuntu. Elizabeth (pleia2), gave an abbreviated introduction to contributing to FOSS. They also had time after the talks to enjoy pizza, sodas, and have discussions about Ubuntu and computers. Pictures at the link.

==== Dustin Kirkland: Results of the Ubuntu Virtualization Survey ====

A big thanks to everyone that participated in the Ubuntu Virtualization Survey. I am pleased to share the results with you now. http://blog.dustinkirkland.com/2009/10/ubuntu-virtualization-poll-your.html

* Results: http://rookery.canonical.com/%7Ekirkland/Virtualization_survey_2009_11_02.pdf
* Answers: http://rookery.canonical.com/%7Ekirkland/Answers_Virtualization_Survey_2009-11-02.pdf

I will provide a few of my own observations, but we are very interested in your own conclusions!

* There were a total of 354 responses -- excellent feedback!

* Nearly 2/3 of all responders use virtualization on Ubuntu every day -- wow!

* Over 3/4 of responders have VT acceleration -- that's overwhelming, I think, and it supports our focus on KVM.

* Still, there's 21% of responders who cannot use KVM. kqemu has been deprecated by upstream QEMU, so I think Virtual``Box represents the best option at this point for non-accelerated virtualization.

* 36.7% of responders most use Virtual``Box, 22.6% most use KVM. Virtual``Box is in Universe and essentially unmaintained by Canonical (though some community individuals are doing an excellent job maintaining it!). I don't know what the business opportunity is around Virtual``Box. But it is clear that it's popular among Ubuntu users. People really like the interface and the usability. And we could probably really improve the experience for a large number of Ubuntu virtualization users with some dedicated Canonical effort to clean up the Virtual``Box bug backlog.

* My survey design was evidently flawed on Question #3, as a large number of people "wrote in" an "EC2" answer there. This is an interesting approach, as it diminishes the importance of having VT on the local system.

* In terms of interfaces, virt-manager and virsh are both lagging behind kvm-from-the-command-line and Virtual``Box. I don't know if this means that we should, or should not invest more in the libvirt-based tools. Is the lack of a good GUI for KVM hindering its adoption? I think this data says so...

* Finally, the overwhelming majority suggests that better documentation is simply required for Ubuntu virtualization. I wonder how we should approach solving this? Is this something that we as engineers should be able to just crank out ourselves? Or should we tap into the Ubuntu-Documentation-Team, and attempt to rally a virt-documentation blitz from some more skilled tech writers?

In summary, I think the most important observations were:

* The overwhelming number of respondents have access to VT hardware.

* Virtual``Box is quite popular in the wild, despite a lack of Canonical investment.

* The lack of a better user-interface is hindering KVM's adoption.

* Better documentation is undoubtedly requested.

==== Shane Fagan: Parental Control ====

I've done a good bit of work recently on parental control to get it ready for the UDS. It currently works but it takes a little bit of effort (you have to start the daemon in command line). I'm going to be making it simpler to use next. Ive also made some more changes to the UI so please keep translating https://translations.launchpad.net/parental-control/

Thanks so much to everyone who has worked on it so far!

http://shanefagan.com/2009/11/12/parental-control-2/

==== Dustin Kirkland: Introducing Testdrive ====

I'm pleased to introduce a new package I have created for Ubuntu called testdrive! Testdrive makes it simple to run any Ubuntu release in a virtual machine, safely, and without affecting your current Ubuntu installation. http://launchpad.net/testdrive

This is a great way to "try out" the Ubuntu release beyond your current version, before upgrading. For example, if you're still running Ubuntu 9.04, you could testdrive Ubuntu 9.10 before committing to the upgrade.

You could also testdrive a different flavor of Ubuntu, such as Xubuntu, Kubuntu, Netbook Remix, or the Ubuntu Server. This is great way of learning more about the Ubuntu galaxy, as well as introducing yourself, to the wide world of virtualization in Ubuntu.

I expect that testdrive will be very useful to Ubuntu developers, testers, and bug triagers during the Lucid development cycle, as these people will be able to test Lucid's daily ISOs throughout the cycle, and in particular at the release milestones for ISO-acceptance-testing.

Visit the link below to find out the prerequisites, how to install testdrive, and how to run the app. Dustin will also be giving a talk at UDS in Dallas where he'll demo testdrive as an example of what we can do with KVM and Virtualization in Ubuntu.

==== 10 reasons Ubuntu 9.10 will be a game changer for business ====

Jack Wallen, writing for Tech``Republic, feels that businesses will like Ubuntu 9.10, and lists 10 reasons for feeling that way.
1. The new Software Center that includes commercial programs.
2. Ubuntu One, with it's ability to synchronize between machines automatically
3. Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud Images that are easily downloaded and installed.
4. Quickly, which is a new framework for developers to accelerate the development process.
5. Better Intel graphics support with the move from EXA to UXA acceleration method.
6. Faster and stronger App``Armor for additional security
7. Blocking module loading to prevent kernel root kits from being installed
8. Boot time, which is getting closer to the elusive 10-second boot time.
9. HAL deprecation in favor of Device``Kit-Power, Device``Kit-Devices and udev.
10. Telepathy, the pluggable framework for real-time communication like chat, voice/video over IP and logging.

The full write-up on his reasons can be found at the link.

==== The Karmic Koala - Not Ubuntu's Vista ====

Ghabuntu (ghabuntu.com) defends the allegation that Ubuntu 9.10 is similar to the failure of Microsoft Vista.  To this writer, Karmic Koala is a departure from previous releases due to the addition of new functionality, and new can mean bugs.  But that new functionality is what people have been asking for.  He/she recommends that one do a clean install to avoid some of the problems associated with upgrades from a previous release.  You can find the article at the link.

http://www.ghabuntu.com/2009/11/karmic-koala-not-ubuntus-vista.html

==== Is Ubuntu Broken? ====

Erlik of Tech-no-Media says that there seems to be quite a few concerns and complains about recent Ubuntu releases. Are there really that many regressions and instabilities with the latest releases of Ubuntu? Probably! So is Ubuntu broken? Erlik says he doesn't think so, at least not more than most other Linux distributions. He feels that the problem is that we have two kinds of Linux desktops with their own problems. On one side you have the sedate LTS releases that are stable and ready for the average user, but may be incompatible with newer hardware and software. On the other side you have the bleeding edge interim releases with all the their problems and breakneck 6 month release cycles. Most problems arise when someone wanting a long term solution (a LTS) is forced to use an interim release instead because of hardware compatibility. In the end there is probably no perfect solution. http://www.tech-no-media.com/2009/11/is-ubuntu-broken.html

==== Installing Ubuntu 9.10 ====

Softpedia's Marius Nestor states that Ubuntu 9.10, also known as the Karmic Koala, arrived exactly on October 29, 2009 and is the eleventh release of Ubuntu OS. He has created a tutorial to teach Linux newcomers how to install the Ubuntu 9.10 operating system on their personal computer. Therefore, it is addressed to people who have just heard about Ubuntu, those who have never installed Ubuntu before and want to test it, but don't know how. The tutorial will make things very simple for you, but if you get stuck somewhere in the middle of the installation and you need help, do not hesitate to use Softpedia's commenting system at the end of the article! http://news.softpedia.com/news/Installing-Ubuntu-9-10-126370.shtml

==== New Ubuntu OS Features Create Good Karma ====

Jack M. Germain, in an article for Linux``Insider, looks at Karmic Koala and overall likes what he sees.  Though he had some problems with the Ubuntu Netbook Remix on a netbook, still he felt that the improvements included in the release were worth it.  Among the things he liked were the inclusion of Firefox 3.5 and Open``Office.org 3.1.  Most significant to him was the Software Center application.

==== Two Simple Suggestions for Ubuntu ====

Christopher Smart of Linux Magazine notes that his last (admittedly strongly worded) article ("Hey Ubuntu, Stop Making Linux Look Bad", http://www.linux-mag.com/cache/7600/1.html) appears to have touched quite a nerve out there in the community. Perhaps some readers jumped the gun when they saw the title and didn’t read the whole article, or perhaps he didn’t make his point clear. Either way, Smart has decided to clarify his perspective a little, because he actually does care about Linux. Follow this link to read further what Smart has to say: http://www.linux-mag.com/cache/7607/1.html

==== Computerbank installs Ubuntu on recycled PCs ====

Georgina Swan of Computer``World notes that the not-for-profit organization, Computerbank Victoria, is installing Ubuntu 9.04 on refurbished computers for people with a government healthcare card and Australian students.  Prices start at $30 and recipients have to sign an acknowledgement that they are receiving a Linux-based system.  But Computerbank is nice enough to install media codecs and flash, and do other customizing to make it easier for new and non-technical computer users to get up and running right away.

=== In The Blogosphere ===

==== Nicaraguan schools go Ubuntu ====

The Ministry of Education in Nicaragua wants to put Ubuntu in public and private elementary and secondary schools. Their goal is to create a derivative distribution based on Ubuntu, that would adapt free software to fit the national curriculum. Among those chosen to participate in the endeavour is the Nicaragua Lo``Co team.  The author sees this as an opportunity both to advocate Ubuntu and to contribute back upstream.

==== Advice Against Upgrading Ubuntu 9.04 to 9.10 ====

Mathaba is upset with Ubuntu 9.10, due to issues he had with installing it on an ASUS laptop.  Things that just worked with 9.04 were broken or he felt weren't appropriate (such as the login sequence and color scheme of the boot screens).  On top of that, his migration back to 9.04 was made more difficult due to changes in the Master Boot Record from the 9.10 installation.  In all, he felt that there was no advantage in upgrading from 9.04 to 9.10

http://mathaba.net/news/?x=622051

==== Ubuntu 9.10: My First 10 Days ====

Christopher Tozzi of Works With U, has used Ubuntu 9.10 for 10 days now, and offers his evaluation, good and bad.  He feels that Karmic is a lot prettier than it's predecessors, and has faster boot times.  Firefox 3.5 by default he likes, as he does the fact that his wireless card works much better.  However, even though graphics were better on his laptop, his desktop had an unexpected bug affecting Compiz-Fusion, and he may have to go back to Jaunty on it.  The volume applet has been changed (again), and the weather applet doesn't work for him.  Plus, there's been a change in the way to get flash to work in 64bit, and the init.d script for Network``Manager has been updated, but the documentation hasn't.  So, even though he feels it's a fine release, he feels that there are some non-trivial bugs that really need to be addressed.

==== Arkeia Releases Free Network Backup Software for Ubuntu ====

David Hamilton, reporting for Web Host Industry Review, notes that Arkeia is providing a network backup solution for Ubuntu 8.04 LTS.  This solution is for one free license of Arkeia Network Backup Enterprise Edition for Ubuntu granted per individual or or company.  It includes one server running on Ubuntu and 2 client agents to backup many types of client machines including Windows workstations and desktops, and the vast majority of Linux machines, Mac OS X and BSD computers. This is now available in the Ubuntu 8.04 LTS repository.

==== Canonical and Creative Commons Meet Donations Target ====

Jono Bacon posted on his blog that Melissa from the Creative Commons pointed him to the rather good news that Canonical’s offer to match Creative Commons donations up to $3000 has already been matched. "Just five days ago we announced that Canonical would be generously matching every donation dollar for dollar for the next week – up to $3,000. Well, we met that goal in record time! Thanks to everyone who donated in the past five days and had your donation doubled – for a total of $6,000 going toward our annual campaign to sustain CC! Many thanks to Canonical for their ongoing support of free culture and Creative Commons. We still have a long way to go to reach our $500,000 goal for this year’s campaign, so please donate today and show your support for a culture of sharing!" Thanks to everyone who donated, and if you haven’t donated yet, go and contribute! http://www.jonobacon.org/2009/11/09/canonical-and-creative-commons-meet-donations-target/
