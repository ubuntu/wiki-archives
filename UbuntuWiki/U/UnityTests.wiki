== Manual Unity 5.0 tests ==
=== Rationale ===
This is the temporary manual unity 5.0 tests before the tool for having them is done for community participation.

Those tests requires that you have the default settings enabled and default theme.

Unity2D specific differences are commented like this: [2D: difference]

=== Tests ===
