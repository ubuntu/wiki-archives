Dec 12 23:33:05 <DanteAshton>	so it wont be in the near future

Dec 12 23:35:00 <DanteAshton>	that is part of the agreement, we get access to the studio, and the students benefit from it.

</pre>

=== Meetings ===
<pre>
Dec 12 23:43:41 <UndiFineD>	Meetings
Dec 12 23:44:39 <UndiFineD>	it has been suggested yesterday we have a meeting every 2 weeks, for most it is preferred in the weekend it seems
Dec 12 23:45:13 <DanteAshton>	saturday WOULD be better....
Dec 12 23:45:17 <UndiFineD>	 <cassidyjames> I think we will set up another Doodle poll to be sure (and for members who couldn't make it yesterday evening)
Dec 12 23:45:27 <DanteAshton>	we seem to have a lot more on saturday....
Dec 12 23:46:05 <UndiFineD>	I am also willing to have these re-runs on a different weekday
Dec 12 23:47:12 <UndiFineD>	I think this requires an action
Dec 12 23:47:38 <UndiFineD>	ACTION setup doodle poll for meeting time on saturday
Dec 12 23:47:44 <DanteAshton>	??
Dec 12 23:48:44 <UndiFineD>	ACTION request views on these re-runs in the mailinglist
Dec 12 23:49:45 <UndiFineD>	ok next ?
</pre>

=== Any other business ===
<pre>
Dec 12 23:50:15 <UndiFineD>	Any other business (before we move to scripts)
Dec 12 23:50:35 <UndiFineD>	feel free to ask
Dec 12 23:50:40 <UndiFineD>	anything
Dec 12 23:51:29 <UndiFineD>	....
</pre>

=== Scripts ===
<pre>
Dec 12 23:52:16 <UndiFineD>	Scripts
Dec 12 23:52:27 <UndiFineD>	much has been written / said
Dec 12 23:53:09 <UndiFineD>	if you feel you would like to add your grand idea, here is another chance to do so
Dec 12 23:53:57 <UndiFineD>	no ?
Dec 12 23:54:23 <UndiFineD>	Ok then I think this sums it up
Dec 12 23:54:26 <Merk>	is there a time frame to where we're going to settle on a script/scripts?
Dec 12 23:54:54 <UndiFineD>	hmm DanteAshton 
Dec 12 23:55:45 <UndiFineD>	we have not yet set a time frame for first production
Dec 12 23:56:11 <UndiFineD>	as there is a christmas break at the studio, we have time to make ideas
Dec 12 23:56:27 <UndiFineD>	and work things out
Dec 12 23:57:00 <UndiFineD>	there are plenty of production possibilities
Dec 12 23:57:11 <UndiFineD>	and we named some of it
Dec 12 23:57:17 <Merk>	it wouldn't have to be soon, I just feel that if it doesn't exist at all, the mailinglilst and meets will constantly talk about the pros/cons of various scripts 
which will never go beyond that point because we'll just constantly talk about them
Dec 12 23:57:45 <UndiFineD>	so if you have something, please put it out there so we can review
Dec 12 23:58:59 <UndiFineD>	on the various communtication channels a lot of good  and bad ideas came up
Dec 12 23:59:28 <UndiFineD>	I will try to compile them for the next meeting, but I might miss something
Dec 12 23:59:45 <UndiFineD>	and so we can discuss the best stuff in the next meeting
Dec 13 00:00:23 <UndiFineD>	Merk, good enough ?
Dec 13 00:00:53 <Merk>	yes
Dec 13 00:01:18 <UndiFineD>	great if there is anything more say so now
Dec 13 00:01:31 <UndiFineD>	otherwise i will wrap this up
Dec 13 00:01:49 <UndiFineD>	ACTION compile great ideas
Dec 13 00:02:39 <UndiFineD>	ok, thank you all for being here, next meeting will be held in the new channels
Dec 13 00:02:54 <UndiFineD>	me and my bot uat are in each of them
Dec 13 00:03:22 <UndiFineD>	#ubuntu-adverts  #ubuntu-adverts-social #ubuntu-adverts-sponsors #ubuntu-adverts-documentation #ubuntu-adverts-design #ubuntu-adverts-leaders
