=== Summary ===
Ubuntu variant websites need to be redesigned to have a more structured and targeted content.

=== Rationale ===

Sharing more content and process will also reduce the workload for the maintainers.

=== Use Cases ===
Holger heard about Kubuntu and now wants to know more.

Luite wants to know what's going on in the Kubuntu community

Rinse wants to change the color of her desktop to green and is looking for documentation on how to do that.

Alexander the Fortran developer wonders how he can get involved with Kubuntu.

=== Scope ===
The website's (kubuntu.org) design and structure.

=== Design ===
The site will be switched from the custom-made PHP scripts to Drupal.

What's on the site?

* Announcements / News
* blocks for newsitems
* Download / Get Kubuntu
* Same ISO / download chooser as ubuntu
* Ubuntu website should also point to Kubuntu (and Edubuntu)
* Screenshots
* Support
* Getting Involved

Editorial Process

=== Implementation ===
Kubuntu: Use ken's design {{http://muse.19inch.net/~jr/tmp/web-idea2.png}} but keep drupal template as close to ubuntu as possible for maintainability

Edubuntu: Use modified/specialized Ubuntu design

Poke Matthew Newzum to have kubuntu/edubuntu download on ubuntu.com download page, to be reused on other sites
