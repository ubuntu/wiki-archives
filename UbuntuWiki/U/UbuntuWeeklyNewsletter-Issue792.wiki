==== Ubuntu Studio is the perfect operating system for creators ====

Jack Wallen tells us Ubuntu Studio is a perfect distribution if we create audio, video, or image content, and thus explores it in this article. With a list of the pre-installed apps and some screenshots, we're told of the "pros" of Ubuntu Studio; which are numerous. Conversely, Jack considers the one "con" (Kdenlive) he sees; he fears it isn't as useful as some proprietary options.
