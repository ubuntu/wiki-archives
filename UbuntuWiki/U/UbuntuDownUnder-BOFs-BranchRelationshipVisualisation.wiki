=== Summary ===

For a variety of reasons, software developers will want to see the relationships between branches of a product: what they derive from, what derives from them, how often they merge from each other, and so on. Launchpad will use an HTML tree to show basic hierarchy -- which branches are mostly descendants of which other branches. More detailed information about relationships will be shown with an image, regenerated after each merge.
