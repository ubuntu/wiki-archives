__TOC__

Purpose of this page: This page lists all the packaging changes that '''deliberately differ''' from packaging in Debian.

== Table Of Contents ==

== General Changes ==

=== Langpacks ===

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| '''Keywords'''
| translations
|-
| '''Affected Packages'''
| All packages with message files (gettext, GSI (!OpenOffice.org translations format))
|-
| '''Rationale'''
| Separate all translations for one language in its own set of packages; it should be possible to update translations in stable releases without changing the binary application packages.
|-
| '''Status'''
| Implemented.
|-
| '''Release'''
| Ubuntu 5.04 (hoary) for gettext, Ubuntu 6.06 (dapper) for GSI
|}

==== Description ====

See MataroSessionsWorkshops/LanguagePacks for an early specification. <nowiki>[[UbuntuDevelopment-Internationalisation]]</nowiki> too.

==== Instructions ====

Nothing needs to be done in the source package. To see the effects of stripping the translations, install the pkgbinarymangler for the build of the package (<nowiki>[[UbuntuDevelopment-Internationalisation-RecipeVerifyingTranslationUploads|detailed instructions]]</nowiki>).

Also the package needs to <nowiki>[[UbuntuDevelopment-Internationalisation-Packaging#TranslationTemplates| generate a .pot file]]</nowiki>, so Launchpad Translations has the newest translation templates.

=== MaintainerFields ===

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| '''Keywords'''
| sources, control file, maintainer
|-
| '''Affected Packages'''
| All packages in main and universe, which are modified (compared to the Debian version)
|-
| '''Rationale'''
| Debian maintainers have expressed discontent about the Maintainer field being unchanged in Ubuntu, because this causes them to be contacted in some situations where they are not the correct point of contact.
|-
| '''Status'''
| Currently being implemented
|-
| '''Release'''
| Target: Ubuntu 7.04 (feisty)
|}

==== Description ====

==== Instructions ====

Follow the instructions in <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2006-December/023032.html]]</nowiki>; please DO NOT upload packages just changing the maintainer fields. This will be done by automated uploads.

==== Description ====

Packages showing the distribution name or logo either in logs, error messages or about dialogs (and similiar) should use the name "Ubuntu"; this name should be used for Kubuntu and Xubuntu as well.

==== Instructions ====

Add a patch to the package changing the distribution name. Instead of hardcoding the name, it's better to just reuse the output of "dpkg-vendor --query Vendor".
