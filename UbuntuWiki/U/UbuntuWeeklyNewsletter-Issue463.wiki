==== Xubuntu: Xubuntu 16.04 Wallpaper Competition Winners! ====

The Xubuntu team announced the results of the 16.04 wallpaper competition. Of the 92 submissions only 6 were to be chosen, but due difficulty in picking the "best", 6 grew to become 10. The link contains reduced sized images of the 10, and xubuntu-community-wallpapers package (full-sized images) are installed when you install Xubuntu 16.04.

http://xubuntu.org/news/xubuntu-16-04-wallpaper-competition-winners/

==== Jorge Castro: A Quick Intro to Juju Resources ====

Jorge Castro blogs about "blobs" which he defines as “workload payloads, binaries for software, or whatever bits you need to deploy and manage.” He explains that blobs have always been useful, but Juju never really understood them. A new concept has been introduced into Charms called "Resources", which are binary-blobs that the charm can utilize. This is achieved via a new clause in yaml (resources:), and with new commands "juju list-resources", "juju push-resource" & "juju charm list-resources".

http://www.jorgecastro.org/2016/04/19/a-quick-intro-to-juju-resources/

==== Jonathan Riddell: KDE Neon User Edition Tech Preview ====

Jonathan Riddell tells us briefly that KDE neon User Edition Tech Preview is out now. Built on a foundation of Ubuntu 16.04LTS & coming with Qt 5.5, it contains Plasma 5.6.3. He notes that it does contain some known issues, but if you'd like to test, filling out a 'testers questionnaire' would be most helpful, with user support available via a fb or g+ group, or post on KDE forums.

http://jriddell.org/2016/04/20/kde-neon-user-edition-tech-preview/

==== Dustin Kirkland: By the numbers: Ubuntu 16.04 LTS ====

Dustin Kirkland created some great stats from the Ubuntu Xenial archive placed on a local SSD. Beyond the simple "6th LTS" release; Dustin provides stats on the number of debs for each architecture (armhf, ... i386, ... s390x & no-arch), how many lines of source code (using 'cloc') and how they break up into various languages (C, C++, ... bash, ... fortran, ... assembly, … pascal, ...) and more.

http://blog.dustinkirkland.com/2016/04/by-numbers-ubuntu-1604-lts.html

==== Zygmunt Krynicki: Snappy interfaces, plugs, slots and connections ====

Zygmunt Krynicki continues a series about snappy interfaces. In this second blog he focuses on connections. Zygmunt defines a connection as an ordered tuple (plug, slot) and proceeds to explain it using .yaml example. Covering "Plugs and slots", "Connections", "Binding plus and slots to app", before going to "Working with connections" where he shifts to shell commands to make it all come together.

http://www.zygoon.pl/2016/04/snappy-interfaces-plugs-slots-connections.html

==== Sean M. Davis: Translation Updates! ====

Sean Davis tells us that some releases are notable only for their improved translations; which in his opinion includes LightDM GTK+ Greeter Settings 1.2.1, Menu``Libre 2.1.3 & XFCE Panel Switch 1.0.4. Sean lists the languages that contain translation updates, which are available to anyone running Ubuntu 16.04, or can be downloaded via provided Launchpad links.

==== Canonical Design Team: Redesigning ubuntu.com’s navigation ====

Inayaili de Leon Persson informs us that the web team had a offsite week-long 'sprint' in Holborn, central London. They write that one of the key items in the agenda was to brainstorm solutions for easier Ubuntu web-site navigation. This was last done in 2013; and Inayaili provides photos & details of how this transpired (including looking at how other sites do it). The design work is complete; now it awaits a prototype for testing.

==== Ubuntu Studio: New Ubuntu Studio Release and New Project Lead! ====

In addition to electing Set Hallström as their new project lead, Ubuntu Studio has issued their version of the 16.04 LTS release. Key features of this release include rewritten Ubuntu Studio controls and the transition from libav to ffmpeg.

http://ubuntustudio.org/2016/04/new-ubuntu-studio-release-and-new-project-lead/

==== Zygmunt Krynicki: snap install --devmode ====

Zygmunt Krynicki highlights the --devmode function in snap install. He points out, “Development mode is aimed at snap developers to let them understand what their application (or application toolkit) is doing under the hood.”

==== Made in China: Meizu Pro 5 Ubuntu Edition dares to be different ====

Jason Perlow of ZDNet details how an upcoming version of the Meizu Pro 5 will use Ubuntu rather than an Android mobile OS, thereby offering an alternative to Android based devices. In doing so, he writes that Meizu offers a compelling and reasonably-priced phablet that is capable of competing with flagship devices from Meizu’s larger competitors.

An article on Help Net Security talks about the availability of Snappy in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. They talk about the security aspect, the cloud, and embedded technology and some other features in 16.04 available to users

https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2016/04/21/ubuntu-16-04-lts/

==== Ubuntu Snap doesn't have the security issue -- X11 does ====

Fahmida Y. Rashid from Info``World disproves the recent article by Matthew Garrett that states that the Snap format is insecure, because X11 can be manipulated by any application. She points out that the “security risk isn't from Snap packages, but from the fact that X11 is insecure -- how X11 trusts applications is a well-known security risk. Snap doesn't change X11's trust model, so the fact that applications can see what other applications are doing isn't a weakness in the new package format, but rather X11's.”
