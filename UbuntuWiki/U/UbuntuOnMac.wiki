| Beige G3
| Ubuntu 5.04
| 
| 
| The installation was a little obscure, mainly because the beige G3 is an Old World Mac and won't boot the Ubuntu CD. I got it going with BootX quite easily and then used a few Unix tricks to get BootX to start up the installed system. I can write up a full description of how I did it if anyone's interested. The resulting system seems to work just fine, although I was a little surprised to find that there's no C compiler included.

| Display/videocard setting not autodetected (copy Apple's X11 xorg.conf file to your ubuntu partition to fix it), internal modem not supported (download the linuxant softmodem driver from OS X), everything else works.

|-
| eMac G4 1.25GHz
| Ubuntu 5.10 ''live''
| 
| 
| Seems to boot fine, including the Ubuntu logo (I assume that means X is working). Screen goes blank shortly after "starting Gnome" message. Not sure what to try next.
| 
| 
|-
| Dual 1.25Ghz MDD G4 (1.5 Gigs of Ram)
| Ubuntu 5.10
| 
| 
| Everything worked right at startup. My only issues are low sound volume and sound distorting if I try to turn it up. Really, even though it's nowhere near as loud in Ubuntu as in OS X, it's still a very reasonable listening level. My video card doesn't seem to like any of the GL screen savers, and it shows them for a second and then goes to a blank screen, but all other video stuff seems to work fine.
