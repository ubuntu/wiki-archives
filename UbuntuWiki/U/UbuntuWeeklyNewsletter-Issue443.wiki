==== Ubuntu Studio Is a Treasure Trove for Creative Types ====

Jack M. Germain of Linux Insider takes a look at Ubuntu Studio 15.10 which he says “bundles a nearly full range of multimedia content-creation applications for workflows involving audio, graphics, video, photography and publishing.” He reviews some of the bundled applications, points out that the classic Xfce desktop is installed by default, and concludes that Ubuntu Studio 15.10 is a solid gateway for artistic enthusiasts catering more to graphic and audio users.

==== Unity 8 for Ubuntu Desktop Explained - What You Need to Know ====

Silviu Stahie of Softpedia writes that Unity 8 is coming to the Ubuntu desktop but that there is still a lot of uncertainty about how it will look. He says that one common misconception is that it will look like Unity 8 on the phone, but it already looks quite different. Silviu reminds us that although Canonical wants to have a single operating system for all devices there will be different builds but the core will be the same.
