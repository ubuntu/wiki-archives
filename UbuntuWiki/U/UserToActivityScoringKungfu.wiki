=== Assumptions about computer interfaces ===

 1. The first goal of a computer interface is to provide information.
 2. The second goal of a computer interface is to provide an easy access to activities.
 3. The perfect amount of operations to access a particular activity is none.

=== Scoring table ===
Scores are based on discoverability, skills and concentration required, to perform an action in order to achieve a particular task. The input devices involved are the mouse and the keyboard. A perfect interface would score 0 at this test.
