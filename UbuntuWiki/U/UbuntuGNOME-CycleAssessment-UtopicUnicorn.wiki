== Introduction ==
Starting from Vivid Vervet (15.04) Cycle, <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuGNOME/GettingInvolved/WhoWeAre | Ubuntu GNOME Team]]</nowiki> will start, at the beginning of each new cycle, to do a full assessment for Ubuntu GNOME technical wise and community wise. This is in short like a full report for the previous cycle. A report to highlight our weak points, areas to be improved, achievements, future plans, and so on.

=== The Scale ===
The scale of this assessment will be '''(10) points''' where 10/10 is excellent and 1/10 is very bad. '''0/10''' means N/A.

== Technical ==
'''To be reviewed/edited by <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~darkxst | Tim (darkxst)]]</nowiki>, Ubuntu GNOME Technical Manager'''.

'''Notes:'''
* Only few bugs with the release of Ubuntu GNOME 14.10. 3/10 score means it is a bit buggy due to the bugs mentioned on the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UtopicUnicorn/ReleaseNotes/UbuntuGNOME | release notes]]</nowiki>.
* Not so many new features with Ubuntu GNOME 14.10.

'''Notes:'''
* Despite the QA sub-team showed a great deal of commitment and hard work during the Release Candidate of Ubuntu GNOME 14.10, it wasn't active enough for the rest of the Utopic Unicorn Cycle.
* Although the number of reporting bugs but only those who contributed to testing is good/accepted, the triage process was weak at some point and okay at some other point.
* More testers are needed.
* There must be two groups within the QA Team: (1) Bug Reporting Group (2) Bug Triage Group
* QA Team need to use the ISO Tracker more often. It has been used by very few.

'''Notes:'''
* There is Team Leader and Acting Team Leader but it seems real life is getting into the way.
* This team has a communication problem. More communications are needed and required.
* Has done a great job to include new themes and icons but the packaging team failed to include that by default.
* Failed to re-design the logo as planned previously.
* Plymouth needs some attention. Failed to stick to the plan and did not change it for 14.10 cycle.
* In general, this is a great team with great members but it needs more active contributors.
* For the 2nd cycle, managed to complete the wallpaper contest which is great.

'''Note:'''
* Despite all the hard efforts to recruit new bloods to Ubuntu GNOME Team, only few have remained.
* Although this was a one-man-team where only <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/amjjawad | Ali/amjjawad]]</nowiki> was recruiting, the importance of this team is increasing. Hence, this is one of the most important sub-teams.
* This team needs an active Team Leader.
* I think I figured out what is wrong and why only few remained around. Hope we could avoid that with the next cycle.
 
=== Brainstorming ===

| '''Brainstorming Team Evaluation'''
| 1/10
|}

'''Notes:'''
* Sadly, this sub-team was a huge disappointment for Utopic Unicorn Cycle.
* Since the establishment of this sub-team until now, there were only 3 members active on the blueprints.
* Most of the activities on the blueprints and the planning side have been done by only one, that is the leader of this team (<nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/amjjawad | Ali/amjjawad]]</nowiki>).
* I'd suggest to put this team on hold for the next cycle due to the fact that there was no serious activities and the brainstorming process is generally done by the whole team - if required - and there is no urgent need for this team based on the above figures.
* Lack of many areas are the main reason why this is a dead team or a one-man-team.

'''Notes:'''
* As always, the best sub-team ever was and still the Wiki & Docs Team.
* However, the team was a bit lazy for the Utopic Unicorn Cycle due to real life, etc.
* More contributors are always recommended for any team.
* This team has active/semi-active members and they are almost available whenever needed.
* Those active members are Acting Team Leader for this team.

=== Marketing ===

'''Notes:'''
* For Utopic Unicorn Cycle, the mailing list was quiet most of the time and the activities were less than average or average.
* Same goes for the website.
* Despite the lack of communications on the website and the mailing list, our social media channels were active and publishing whenever possible. Yet, not as good as required.
* Google+ has always the best interaction between the users and Ubuntu GNOME Team. Twitter is the worst. Facebook is okay.
* Due to the fact that only <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/amjjawad | Ali/amjjawad]]</nowiki> - the Team Leader of this team - was almost the only one who is in charge or active within this team, the very weak score is not a surprise and reasonable.
* Without a doubt, this team needs lots of attention and much more activities.

'''Notes:'''

* Ubuntu GNOME Translations Activities have never started until the release of Ubuntu GNOME 14.10.
* After sending <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-gnome/2014-October/002345.html | this call for translations]]</nowiki>, the activities have started.
* Despite the activities are very recent and new, the translators showed a great deal of interest and commitment and this is very promising and encouraging to take this to the next level.
* There is no '''active''' Team Leader for this team yet.
