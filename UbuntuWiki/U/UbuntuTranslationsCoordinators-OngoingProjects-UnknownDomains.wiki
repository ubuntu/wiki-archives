=== Unknown translation domains ===

When generating language-packs, occasionally errors show up in the log. One of those errors is called "unknown translation domain", which indicates that a given translation domain is either not used by any package in 'main', or that the translation domain name is buggy (i.e. has been renamed or contains errors, like upper/lower case letters, etc.).
