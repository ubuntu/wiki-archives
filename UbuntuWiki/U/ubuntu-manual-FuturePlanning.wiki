=== Welcome to the top secret UMP Future Planning committee ===

<nowiki>[[File:loop.jpg]]</nowiki>

This is where we decide on the future for our project and brainstorm ideas for future cool stuff.

What I would like the manual project to accomplish:

* Other ways to package our manual
** Online topic-based HTML5 version with help videos, lots of images etc
** Double-up/book version optimized for printing 
** A bare-minimum quickstart pamphlet to go with the LiveCD
* Improving distribution
** Physical copies of the manuals available for purchase at lulu.com (the downloads are still free though)
** Awesome website with automated language-recognition and downloading
** Inclusion on the default CD and in the Software Center
* New guides
** Kubuntu Manual
** Xubuntu Manual
** Lubuntu Manual
** Ubuntu Developers Manual
** Ubuntu Netbook Edition Manual
* Authoring tools
** Our own LaTeX GUI program (or plugin) with buttons to insert our custom commands
** Quickshot working and fully functional
** Further development of our own tools to make it easy for contributors to help us
** Perhaps our own bug tracker at bugs.ubuntu-manual.org customized for manuals
** Better integration of translations and a smoother, well organized development cycle
* Business development
** Canonical endorsement and support
** Distribution by Dell and System76, others selling Ubuntu machines
** Third-party reviews of the manual (magazines, blogs)
** More publicity, more downloads, more feedback

Obviously, this stuff isn't going to happen overnight. This is where I'd like to see us go, in the long run - now that will take years, but at least by having a plan in place, we know what we want to do.

I want to see the Manual Project, Canonical's in-house documentation, the Ubuntu Community Learning Project, Ubuntu classroom and the Docs team combine into one super-awesome gigantic educational project that works together in harmony with well formulated goals and objectives to provide a wide range of quality educational materials to lower the Linux barrier to entry for new users and in turn increase Ubuntu's market share.

We have an awesome operating system, but we just lack the user education - people don't ''know'' that it's awesome, and they don't know how to use it to its full potential so they can ''see'' how awesome it is. We need to show them this. By incorporating all of the Ubuntu educational projects under one umbrella, we can set out clear target audiences and objectives for each project so all work is efficient and productive as possible. If we have all projects reporting to a single entity, we can also improve consistency across the board to give a better user experience and thereby entice new users to Ubuntu knowing that we have the best OS support infrastructure in the world.
