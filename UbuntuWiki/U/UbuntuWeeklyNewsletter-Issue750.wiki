==== VisionFive 2: a RISC-V alternative to the Pi? ====

Edoardo Barbieri writes about RISC-V working towards becoming an instruction set architecture "alongside x86 and ARM". Edoardo reminds us of Canonical's announcement, and Star``Five's Vision``Five 2 single-board computer. Edoardo provides many specs & details of the SBC, with links for more details, plus links to a Kickstarter campaign to help fund the board's production.

==== Anbox Cloud 1.15.0 has been released ====

Ruth Fuchss, on behalf of the Anbox Cloud team, reports the release of Anbox Cloud 1.15.0. Along with links to component versions, a quick summary of common & AMS new features and improvements is provided. Ruth gives additional links for more details. A list of bug fixes, and a link to upgrade instructions are also provided.

https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/anbox-cloud-1-15-0-has-been-released/30196

==== Ubuntu Desktop Team Indaba - September 23, 2022 15:00 UTC ====

Heather Ellsworth reminds us what the Ubuntu Indabas are about, and tells us the next one will be on 23 September 2022 at 3pm UTC, with Heather Ellsworth, Philipp Kewisch, Sergio Schvezov and Claudio Matsuoka. We are told "a new snap base" has been released (core22), with "some major changes" with snapcraft 7, which will be the topic of this Indaba. The stream will go to both Youtube and twitch, with live chat for people to join, or use this thread in advance of the Indaba.

==== Mir release 2.9.0 ====

Alan Griffiths announces the release of Mir 2.9. A number of improvements are mentioned, as well as the ABI breakage that impacted the Lomiri project (preventing two versions of Mir to co-exist) which has been fixed. A brief changelog includes: ABI details, enhancements, a list of fixed bugs, along with a link to download the source tarball or MIR PPAs.

==== SSHd now uses socket-based activation (Ubuntu 22.10 and later) ====

Steve Langasek (vorlon) discusses the rationale of changing the configuration of openssh-server in Kinetic Kudu (Ubuntu 22.10) OpenSSH. Steve notes the saving of memory as an aid in "a larger effort to reduce the default memory footprint of our images". The change affects Listen``Address and it is possible that upon reboot of the system ssh.socket will fail to start if prior preparations are not implemented in particular use cases; though a reversion is possible.

==== Plasma 5.25 for Jammy 22.04 available via PPA ====

The Kubuntu project reports having many requests for Plasma 5.25 being available for Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. To ensure the stability of the backports PPA, the team reports on the availability of a 'backports-extra' PPA for those that want the packages earlier and are willing to entertain a little more risk. Plasma 5.25 will be available via this 'backports-extra' PPA, though users using backports-extra should have the normal backports PPA also enabled on their systems. The usual caveats and instructions on using the PPA are included.

==== KDE Snap Packages now on ARM and KDE Invent CI ====

Jonathan Esk-Riddell reports 110 KDE apps are available in the Snap store, for execution on any Linux distribution. We are told 350,000 devices installed KDE snaps in the last week, as well as the most popular of those Snaps. Thanks is given to Maximillian Federle, who helped KDE's Invent CI with launchpad builds for both AMD64 and ARM64. Links to the packaging repository are provided, with an invitation for us to talk with the team, if you'd like to help with the effort in packaging more of the apps.

==== Help improve GNOME! ====

This blog is a "guest post by Vojtech Stanek, ... working on an exciting new tool for the GNOME project". We are told of the 'gnome-info-collect' tool, which "collects anonymous data about how GNOME systems are configured", before sending the data to GNOME servers where it can be analyzed, so as to improve GNOME for end-users. This post tells you about the tool, in the hopes you'll install it, run it, scan the report & upload it so your configuration can help the GNOME team to better the GNOME desktop. Packages are available for Fedora, Ubuntu, Arch and openSUSE, with instructions provided.

==== R600 Gallium3D Driver Receives NIR Backend Fixes For Radeon HD 2000/3000/4000 Series ====

Michael Larabel reports on the R300g "driver seeing new shader optimizations", and the fixes for the NIR back-end for "Rade R600 Galium3D driver for the Radeon HD 2000/3000/4000 series". We are told the NIR back-end code concentrated on newer HD 5000/6000 series devices, with older devices now also covered. Links to the merge request are provided.

==== Ubuntu 22.10 May Disable GNOME’s New ‘Device Security’ Panel ====

Joey Sneddon writes about GNOME 43's new 'Device Security' panel, and a bug report where Ubuntu developers report the feature "'confusing and unhelpful' in its current guise". Joey talks about the feature, recognizing what the Ubuntu devs are talking about, and includes some other GNOME responses. Next Joey gives us his view, including some screenshots of it on Fedora 37 for comparison, and how much of the blame for bad ratings is due to OEM/manufacturers (and not the OS). Joey further advises; "Still, it’s also worth keeping in mind that the feature is not finished. GNOME developers DO plan to add further information to this section ...".

==== Meet the Kubuntu Focus NX Mini Linux PC with 11th Gen Intel CPUs, Up to 64GB RAM ====

==== GNOME’s New Quick Toggles Land in Ubuntu 22.10 ====

Joey Sneddon reports that "GNOME Shell 43 beta is now available in the Ubuntu 22.10 daily builds". Joey gives some clues as features he 'loves', particularly the new Quick Toggles menu. He also mentions differences in Ubuntu's Yaru theming versus upstream’s default theme, remarks that some parts are still in proposed, and provides a gif for better appreciation.
