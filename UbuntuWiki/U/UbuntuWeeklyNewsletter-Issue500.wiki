=== Welcome to Issue 500 ===

Welcome to issue number 500 of the Ubuntu Weekly Newsletter. We have an action-packed issue for you this week, with the first beta of Zesty Zapus having come out for selected flavors and news about the latest use of Ubuntu core, containers and more.

To celebrate this issue, we’ve also taken time to turn to our community for feedback and opened up to the first contest that had readers hunt down the answers to various questions about the history of the newsletter.

I hope you enjoy this issue and take a moment to appreciate the work that went into this issue from our team of contributors:

* Paul White
* Chris Guiver
* Vishnu Narayanan
* David Morfin
* Jim Connett

As well as all the news outlets, blogs, podcasters and more whose commitment to reporting on Ubuntu gives us something to write about each week.

Regards, Ubuntu Weekly Newsletter Editor, Elizabeth K. Joseph

==== Words of Thanks ====

This newsletter is a major source of news for many people in our community. The following is a collection of words from key members of the project and various readers of the newsletter:

“Massive congratulations to the UWN team!  It's a sign of the enduring passion and commitment in the team and the Ubuntu Community in general that this newsletter has hit its 500th issue.  It's a time to celebrate the folks who make UWN happen at every level, whether it's producing the newsletter or doing the work that gets reported in the newsletter.  The very first UWN issue celebrated the release of Ubuntu 6.06 LTS, which was the first Long Term Support release of Ubuntu and which laid the groundwork for future LTS releases.  How appropriate that UWN has become one of the longest running open source community newsletters as well. Two fine traditions were born that week.” - Jane Silber

“Ubuntu manages to be both rewarding and exciting thanks to the combined energy and ideas of a very wide and diverse community. Some of us are perfectionists who care about making things work perfectly. Others care about specific experiences or projects. Others about bringing the benefits of free software to the widest possible audience. And still other groups have amazing ideas about the next wave of technology. The Ubuntu Weekly Newsletter is a great example of contributions that raise the tide for every part of Ubuntu, and represent a unique combination of skill and caring. All of these come together to make Ubuntu, with it's wide array of flavors and enormous selection of packages. I want to thank the teams and the leaders who make that possible.” - Mark Shuttleworth

“Ubuntu Weekly News has been a staple of the Ubuntu community for longer than I can remember. In fact, very few people in Ubuntu or Canonical have had a longer period of contribution that the newsletter has. The fact that it comes out every week, almost without fail, for 500 issues is a testament to the care, commitment, and passion for its editors and contributors. It stands a shining example of how our vibrant community makes Ubuntu bigger, better and more accessible than any one company or organization could. Many thanks to everybody who has contributed to it over the years, and especially to those who steadfast leadership have kept it going for so long.” - Michael Hall

“When the Ubuntu Weekly Newsletter was started back in 2006, I do not think anyone would have predicted it would still be going strong 500 issues and over a decade later. It has proven itself as an invaluable concise summary of all of the activities going on in the fast moving community. Everyone who has ever contributed to the newsletter has my eternal gratitude, and I am proud to have played a part in helping the newsletter reach this great milestone. Congratulations on reaching issue 500! Now, on towards issue 600.” - Nathan Handler

“I've been a more-off-than-on editor of the UWN for over three years now. It has been a pleasure being a part of something much larger than any single individual. I'm especially thankful to the leadership and editorial team who've not only welcomed my participation, but have never insisted on my participation. While Ubuntu continues to expand its domain and effectiveness, UWN continues to serve an ever-increasing market as THE news aggregator and central hub for all things Ubuntu. Here's to issue #500 and my best wishes for the next 500 issues!” - Jim Connett

“UWN has always been of a great value to our team here at Softpedia, helping us understand the target audience for our Ubuntu news, which we publish every week. It includes essential information about the new security releases and updated released for all supported Ubuntu versions and gives us an insight about what's going on the Ubuntu world with all the latest news and blogs from the best publications. I'd like to personally thank the UWN team for their hard work over the last 11 years because I know how hard it is to put together such as huge newsletter every single week. Happy anniversary and here's to many more Ubuntu Weekly Newsletter issues!” - Marius Nestor, Editor-in-Chief, Softpedia Linux.

“Thanks for using Ubuntu and here's to another 500 issues!" - Jorge Castro

“Thank you very much for keeping me up to date on Ubuntu and its community all these years.” - Mihai

“Read it EVERY week. Thanks for your diligence and consistency. It's the BEST way for me to keep informed about what is happening in the community. Thanks again, everyone.” - JediJF

“I have been using Ubuntu for nearly 10 years now and get a wide range of updates and news about Ubuntu from the Ubuntu Weekly News to keep me in the loop so from me a great big Issue 500. Thanks!” - Andy Bleaden

==== Congratulations Issue 500 Quiz Winners! ====

Leading up to the 500th issue contributors Paul White and David Morfin worked to get a quiz to Ubuntu Weekly Newsletter contributors. Paul took the time to come up with ten great questions spanning the entire history of the newsletter. David set up the quiz itself in a Google Form so people could quickly and easily respond to it.

And so, we announce the winners of this competition, each of whom will receive a set of Ubuntu News stickers, and some general Ubuntu stickers! These winners all answered a majority of questions correctly.

* Liam Gutierrez
* cariboo
* Andy Bleaden

Congratulations! And thanks to all who participated.
