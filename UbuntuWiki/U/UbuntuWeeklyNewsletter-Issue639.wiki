==== Flutter Wayland support under development ====

William Wold (wmww) presents a work in progress of Flutter running natively on Mir. Initially the Canonical and Google collaboration that brings the Flutter toolkit to linux only supported X11, due to the GTK windowing.

=== The Planet ===

==== kde.org/applications site now with more App Stores and Downloads ====

Jonathan Riddell tells us the kde.org/applications have been updated, providing us with examples: including how we can download the source, or install with just a click. Jonathan thanks Carl for his work, and asks that should we spot out of date information we let a team member know so it can be updated.

==== Lubuntu 19.10 End of Life and Current Support Statuses ====

Dan Simmons confirms too that Lubuntu 19.10 (Eoan Ermine) will be End of Life on Friday, July 17, 2020. There will then be no further updates or bugfixes. Dan writes "After July 17th, the only supported releases of Lubuntu will be 18.04, with LXDE, and 20.04, with LXQt". We are advised to update to 20.04 as soon as possible. Furthermore Dan repeats the advisory that upgrading from some older releases to 20.04 is unsupported. In the event that you have 18.04 or older you are advised to do a fresh install.

=== In the Press ===

==== Google And Ubuntu Join Forces To Make Desktop Linux Better ====

Jason Evangelho highlights the importance of applications to an OS, before telling us about Flutter and Google's Dart programming language. Using a number of sources, including Canonical's Ken Van``Dine's article, we are told of an invitation for application developers to publish their applications using this mechanism that is a joint partnership between Google and Canonical. There is an intention of maintaining "feature parity", with a note it is also very easy to publish those same apps via Canonical's Snap store. Flutter for Linux is currently in Alpha, with links provided if you'd like to learn more.

==== What's This New Ubuntu 'Rolling Rhino' And Do You Need It? ====

Jason Evangelho touches on why many computer users like rolling releases, and that "Rolling Rhino" will scratch that itch. Outlining what it is, and that it's in response to user requests, a warning is given that it's for the "toughest of Ubuntu users". Links to the livestream where it's creation was streamed is given, along with links to the Git``Hub details.

=== In the Blogosphere ===

==== GNOME Shell + Mutter 3.37.3 Are Out Roaring With Better Performance ====

Michael Larabel writes that GNOME 3.37.3 was released without GNOME Shell and Mutter components, being a little late to the party. Those components were released a few hours later and include some large performance improvements which are listed, with links should we need more information. A final note reports Mutter 3.36.4 and GNOME Shell 3.36.4, which contains a few of those changes, backported.

https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=GNOME-Shell-Mutter-3.37.3

==== GNOME 3.36.4 Released With Faster Mutter Fix Back-Ported ====

Michael Larabel writes this time about the GNOME 3.36.4 stable point release which includes the usual bug fixes and translation updates, but also includes a backported Mutter fix which provides a notable performance difference. A link to the original mailing list post is provided.

==== systemd 246-RC1 Released ====

Michael Larabel alerts us that the systemd 246 release candidate is ready for us to test if we're able. We are provided with some of its new features, and a link if we need to know more, or wish to download it. We're also told what didn't make the RC in time.
