=== Introduction ===

Launchpad provides a rich dataset of the open source activity that is '''out there'''.
As a web interface its inherently poll based. Providing a push based interface would
allow interested people to get informed about launchpad activity, prompting them to 
visit specific projects.

=== Rationale ===

The open source community is interested in what is happening, and launchpad has access
to prretty much everything that is happening. Allowing users to be notified of interesting
events will increase the friendliness of the Launchpad and encourage folk to visit on 
regular intervals - when their latest project releases for example.

=== Scope and Use Cases ===

This specification should identify the issues involved in providing both the RSS and email
subscription facilities and document a strategy for addressing them.

A separate specification to provide an implementation allowing Launchpad users to recieve
 email when specific things occur, or view an RSS feed of the same will need to be created
once this strategy is complete.

Example cases:
* John is looking at GnomeBaker in Launchpad. John likes the concept but wants to try the
 next version when its released (because it will support his hardware. So, John clicks on 
 the RSS icon on the product page and
 it gets added to his Blog Aggregator. Then when John reads his aggregator he'll see when
 GnomeBaker releases a new package build or upstream release, and know he can try it out.

* Mary is a developer on GnomeBaker. She is interested in what changes Fred is making in the
 gnomebaker--dvd--0 branch, as they occur. She clicks on the '''envelope''' icon beside freds
 branch name in the GnomeBaker page, and Launchpad then emails her on every commit to that 
 branch. To disable emails Mary needs to go to her LaunchpadSubscriptions page and deselect 
 that subscription.
