=== Introduction ===

For quality purposes, there's a number of automated tests we could do on an Ubuntu distribution before release. This wiki page is being written as a stub, in the hopes that the community would add more suggestions so that we can work towards a comprehensive automated tester, that tests everything that can be tested without needing an actualy human.

=== Test suggestions ===

1. grep through /var and/or other relevant locations and ensure that admin-user password isn't stored anywhere
