==== Announcing Ubuntu 9.04 Release Candidate ====

The Ubuntu team is pleased to announce the Release Candidate for Ubuntu 9.04 Desktop, Server editions and Ubuntu Netbook Remix.  Versions are also available for Kubuntu and Xubuntu. The purpose of the Release Candidate is to solicit one last round of testing before the final release. Here are ways that you can help:

* Upgrade from Ubuntu or Kubuntu 8.10 to the Release Candidate by following the instructions in the release notes referenced above.
* Participate in installation testing using the Release Candidate CD images, by following the testing and reporting instructions at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/ISO

More information is available at the link.

==== Announcing Ubuntu 9.04 Release Candidate for ARM ====

The Ubuntu team is pleased to announce the Release Candidate for Ubuntu 9.04 Desktop edition for the ARM architecture. This first, community-supported ARM release of Ubuntu, targets the i.MX51 Babbage development board and is suitable for use by developers wishing to bring the same high-quality Ubuntu desktop to an even wider range of energy-efficient systems. Images for the NSLU2 "slug" (ixp4xx) are also provided.

Due to the particulars of the systems in question, the installation process is more complex and differs in several important ways from that of a standard Ubuntu desktop system. Further instructions on installing Ubuntu on Babbage boards can be found here:  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BabbageJauntyRCInstall

==== Packaging Training Session Update ====

There was another great Packaging Training Session this week about How-to update a package. Didier Roche did a terrific job of explaining the process of updating a package using a watch file. With the release of Ubuntu 9.04, Jaunty Jackalope, just around the corner, we will soon be faced with the task of updating many of the packages in the Ubuntu repositories to the latest version available upstream. If you are interested in helping out with this task, then you should read through the logs from Didier’s session.

The next Packaging Training Session will be about Package testing: piuparts and VMs, and it will be led by Daniel T Chen. It is scheduled for: 23rd April, 00:00 UTC, and it will take place in #ubuntu-classroom on irc.freenode.net.

==== Announcing Ubuntu Open Week ====

Ubuntu Open Week[1] will be held the week after Ubuntu 9.04’s release, from 27 April to 1 May on #ubuntu-classroom on Freenode. The sessions take place from 1500UTC to 2100UTC (With a special session on Monday night after-hours). There will be the always popular “sabdfl Q+A” session (Thu 30 Apr @ 15.00UTC), in which you have two hours to ask Mark Shuttleworth, the founder of Ubuntu, all your must know questions. Jono and Jorge will also be providing an Introduction and Community Q+A session (Mon 27 Apr @ 15.00UTC) in which you can ask your questions about the community, Ubuntu, Canonical. or anything else.

==== Karma: Where did mine go? ====

If you imported translation files — PO and POT files — into Launchpad from an Ubuntu package, or a Bazaar branch, then you got vastly more karma than if you simply translated directly through Launchpad’s web interface or uploaded PO files as ‘user uploads’. Of course, that was unfair so Launchpad decided to adjust the inflated karma that they had awarded. The way Launchpad calculates karma is pretty complex, so the manual reduction they made to karma awarded for those translation imports has also affected karma given for other types of work — such as bugs, code, or blueprints — even for people who never did anything in Translations.

So, what does this mean? After Launchpad fixed bug #286359 to send import notifications to Ubuntu packagers, they also started giving out translation import karma for them. A large amount of karma was given out compared to other items in Translations, and that caused the total pool of Translations karma to grow, so X started growing for all applications. People noticed that their Translations karma was getting bigger and bigger. Suddenly (or not that suddenly, the scaling factor increased over time), people had about 2–3 times more karma then they were supposed to.

Finally, 6 weeks after Launchpad introduced the problem, they’ve normalized translations karma so uploaders do not have an unfair advantage over actual translators. However that meant that the total pool of Translations karma went down, and with it, X went down and everybody’s karma across the system went down, regardless of the application. The ratio however stayed the same. If you had more karma points than John Doe a week ago, you still have more than him today. So, what actually happened is: karma that was never meant to exist disappeared.

=== The Planet ===

==== Jorge Castro: Support your LoCo economy... ====

Some things just don’t scale. Like say … #ubuntu. It can be frustrating for people who are looking for help during release as everyone floods this channel, everyone is overworked, there are more people that need help that can provide help, it’s a huge channel so you get a bunch of the bad things that come along with that.
Jorge would prefer the more personal approach, like the tighter knit communities of our Local Teams. Release time always has a bunch of buzz, and always an opportunity to reach out to new users, even if it’s the person who tried Ubuntu once in a while and then goes away.

Jorge thinks we should look at using release time as a way for Local Teams to reach out to new users. Instead of piles upon piles of people in #ubuntu maybe we should encourage people to split off into more manageable groups by have people stop by their IRC Lo``Co booth instead. Maybe we as Local Teams should also strive to take more responsibility for our local users and reach out to them actively to get involved in our channels?

==== Shuttleworth: Oracle a Litmus test for Linux, Ubuntu ====

Sean Michael Kerner of Interner``News.com notes that when Ubuntu Linux 9.04 is released for both the server and the desktop on April 23rd it will be lacking at least one key item - Oracle certification. Kerner asked Mark Shuttleworth founder of Ubuntu about the lack of Oracle certification for 9.04 Jaunty Jackalope and he didn't seem too concerned, though he did admit Oracle holds a special place in the application landscape. "Oracle is a litmus test for enterprise readiness. So, Oracle certification is far more important to us as a public testament to the reliability and ruggedness of Ubuntu than it is in terms of sheer volume." Shuttleworth added that he expects that Oracle will eventually certify on Ubuntu, in his view it's just a matter of time as Ubuntu gains momentum. http://blog.internetnews.com/skerner/2009/04/shuttleworth-oracle-a-litmus-t.html

==== Ubuntu 9.04 release candidate arrives ====

ARS Technica's Ryan Paul notes a new version of the popular Ubuntu Linux distribution is scheduled for release next week. A release candidate was made available for download on Thursday to facilitate a final round of testing before the official launch. The new version—9.04, codenamed Jaunty Jackalope—includes some useful improvements and delivers higher reliability than the last few Ubuntu releases. ARS Technica looked at the beta release last month, and the changes since then have mostly been subtle refinements that improve the user experience. Several of the bugs that Paul identified in his beta review, such as the lack of dual-head support in the notification system, have been fixed. The server edition, netbook remix, KDE-based Kubuntu (which will ship with KDE 4.2), and several other variants are also in the release candidate stage. The server edition gained support for Eucalyptus—a cloud computing framework. http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2009/04/ubuntu-904-release-candidate-arrives.ars

==== The five best, new things in Ubuntu Linux 9.04 ====

Computerworld's Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols says he's been using Ubuntu 9.04, Jaunty Jackalope, for the last few weeks, and he recently upgraded to the release candidate. He says he's impressed, and he thinks that you will be too when you download it yourself. X.Org server 1.6 gives you peppier video performance, while GNOME 2.26 gives you a really nice, integrated desktop. Evolution has been upgraded to version 2.26.1, and is now a complete and total Linux replacement for Outlook. Boot times are significantly faster. Ext4 file system support also improved system speed, which is helped further by the Linux kernel 2.6.28-11.37. Overall, Vaughan-Nichols says he's sold on this new Ubuntu. Good solid features and better performance makes for a winning package. http://blogs.computerworld.com/the_five_best_new_things_in_ubuntu_linux_9_04

==== Death of Linux on netbooks greatly exaggerated ====

Ryan Paul of ARS Technica reports that netbooks are growing in popularity because they are attracting budget minded consumers who are looking for better value and mobility. This trend offers a unique chance for the open source Linux platform, which is well-suited for netbooks and doesn't add any licensing costs. The folks at Microsoft, however, contend that they have already won the netbook OS war. In a triumphant blog entry posted earlier this month, Microsoft blogger Brandon Le``Blanc asserted that Redmond has dominated the netbook space. Microsoft's message doesn't entirely reflect reality though. Chris Kenyon, Canonical's OEM services head, took issue with points made by Le``Blanc when he wrote a response in the official Canonical blog. He says that Le``Blanc's characterization of Linux as unpopular on netbooks is an "oversimplification" and he criticizes Microsoft for erroneously contending that Canonical has confirmed MSI's return rate statistics. "Continually repeating that we 'confirmed' a 4x return over XP when we did nothing of the sort is really not worthy of a great company like Microsoft. If we are going to compete, let's do it on real facts and actual statements." http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2009/04/death-of-linux-on-netbooks-greatly-exaggerated.ars

==== Ubuntu circus set to start again ====

IT``Wire's Sam Varghese says that on April 23rd the Ubuntu circus will start all over again. Canonical releases of version 9.04 that day, and lots of bandwidth will be consumed as people upgrade or download the distribution for the first time. Are the new features in Ubuntu 9.04 enough to justify a release though? Varghese is pretty sure that few will agree with him on this, but when he sees releases like this he tends to think that there is something dishonest about them. Why create a whole new release if there is nothing worth releasing? Why not wait for something major before releasing? The retention factor should be due to usability and productivity. When Mark Shuttleworth set out on this grand adventure, Varghese has no doubt that he visualized the day when Ubuntu would be the leading Linux distribution and one that was able to pay its own bills. This rat race to release every six months will, in Varghese's humble opinion, prove the undoing of what was once a noble endeavour. http://www.itwire.com/content/view/24486/1231/1/1/

==== Why Dell Should Stay On Top of Ubuntu Releases ====

Linux Loop comments on an article on Phoronix in which author Michael Larabel argued that Dell should start shipping a newer version of Ubuntu than the 8.04 LTS edition they are shipping now. Larabel justified this on the basis of performance, which has apparently improved dramatically, but there is another reason to stay up to date. As with any operating system, the critical piece is the user experience. In Ubuntu 8.10 tabbed browsing was introduced in Nautilus, a new user-switch applet was added, and a much-improved Network Manager were introduced. Then, in the upcoming Ubuntu 9.04, improved multi-screen support, the ability to import Outlook files easily in to Evolution, improved hibernate and suspend, and faster boot times were introduced. These features may seem trivial, but each adds a little bit to the user experience and is, thus, a worthy update. By sticking with Ubuntu 8.04, Dell is passing up these improvements that have been made and giving their customers a slightly worse experience. http://www.linuxloop.com/news/2009/04/16/why-dell-should-stay-on-top-of-ubuntu-releases/ and http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=ubuntu_netbook_performance&num=11

==== Ubuntu 9.04 due April 23, includes native ARM port ====

Rick Hodgin of geek.com says that while the April 23rd release of Ubuntu 9.04 may be desirable for its feature set alone, it will also spice things up with an additional ISA added to the mix. In addition to the previously supported i386 and AMD64 ISAs, Ubuntu 9.04 will now natively include an ARM installation for ARM-based MIDs and low-end netbooks operating on the ARMv5EL and ARMv6EL-VFP architectures. Why ARM? There is currently a battle taking place at the low-end, and that battle is in performance and battery life, with a heavy bent on battery life. With ARM, the technology is so pervasive that it has seen a tremendous amount of optimization. ARM-based products often provide commensurate levels of performance, when compared to VIA C7M or Nano CPUs, or Intel’s Atom, and often times with greater battery life. If you’ve ever considered giving an alternate OS a try, even on your ARM-based MID or netbook, now may be the time. http://www.geek.com/articles/mobile/ubuntu-904-due-april-23-include-native-arm-port-20090414/

=== In The Blogosphere ===

==== Ordering Ubuntu on a Dell Laptop ====

A blogger from Red Gecko tells us about his experience with his new Dell XPS 1530 with Ubuntu pre-installed. When the blogger first started it up after receiving it in the mail, he was unable to get wireless to work. After plugging in a cat5 cable and running the updates he still had no luck. After going through several Dell support sites trying to get it to work he called up Dell support. After he told them his problem they told him to call up Canonical for help. When he called them, he was told to call up Dell's Linux support line. He spent several hours checking the same things over and over, before he was told to reinstall with the disk that was provided. After he did that, the wireless worked but he still didn't have the fingerprint reader or the webcam working. In conclusion this blogger recommends to companies like Dell, to make their computers work right away with different operating systems. http://red-gecko.blogspot.com/2009/04/ordering-ubuntu-on-dell-laptop.html

==== Ubuntu 9.04 boots in 17.5 seconds! ====

Blogger Matt Cutts tests out the boot speed of Ubuntu 9.04 Jaunty Jackalope. He got an Intel X25-E Extreme solid-state drive (SSD) and wanted to test it out. He was very impressed with the boot time that he had. From pressing the power button to having firefox loaded was 22.5 seconds. That's with 5 seconds for the BIOS display. He achieved this by changing the GRUB timeout from 3 seconds to 0, setup to automatically log himself in, and set firefox as a startup program. http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/ubuntu-904-boots-in-175-seconds/

==== Notification Disappointment in Ubuntu Jaunty ====

Blogger Glyph tells us of his frustrations with the new notification function that is included with Ubuntu Jaunty Jackalope. Glyph is writing applications which he is trying to make cross-platform compatible. with the original notification-daemon, most of the functionality that he wanted was able to be implemented in one way or another. With the new Notify-OSD that is being used in Jaunty he noticed that most of this functionality was no longer available. He goes over specifics in his blog on what is missing, and the frustrations that he has had finding documentation on Notify-OSD. At the end he gives some recommendations to help lessen the blow of some of these issues that he has run into. He would like to see that instead of completely getting rid of something like notify-daemon, to upgrade it or at least leave it in till Notify-OSD has had some more polish. Glyph also continues with letting us know that Notify-OSD has it's good parts, and has much potential. http://glyph.twistedmatrix.com/2009/04/notification-disappointment-in-ubuntu.html

==== Ubuntu 9.04 Server Edition: What to Expect ====

Works``With``U's Christopher Tozzi tells us that the next version of Ubuntu, ‘Jaunty Jackalope’, offers several new features in the server edition. Jaunty server edition’s most noticeable new feature is support for cloud computing via Eucalyptus, which makes it easy to deploy private clouds on Ubuntu servers. Jaunty server edition also includes the dovecot-postfix package for easy installation of mail servers. Ubuntu server 9.04 also ships with Linux kernel 2.6.28 which includes innovations such as support for the ext4 file system, memory-management improvements, and updates to the rapidly maturing KVM virtualization hypervisor, making virtualization via free, integrated tools on Linux more efficient and reliable. Those who opt to put Jaunty into production on their servers will benefit from incremental improvements and new features that, although not yet completely stable, offer cutting-edge functionality. http://www.workswithu.com/2009/04/13/ubuntu-904-server-edition-what-to-expect/

==== Memo to Canonical: Follow Red Hat’s Partner Lead ====

Joe Panettieri of Works``With``U notes that a landmark event occurred recently when the Open Source Channel Alliance launched. Although far from perfect, the alliance shows that Linux and open source applications are gaining momentum with mid-market resellers and solutions providers. Working together, alliance members will promote open source solutions to roughly 15,000 Synnex resellers. Those resellers, in turn, target mid-size business customers across North America. The problem: Red Hat is a driving force in the alliance, and Canonical isn’t involved. It’s a compelling strategy, and in Panettieri's opinion Canonical needs something similar. http://www.workswithu.com/2009/04/14/memo-to-canonical-follow-red-hats-partner-lead/

==== ZaReason Readies Ubuntu 9.04 PCs, Servers ====

Joe Panettieri of Works``With``U reports that after a business trip to China the Za``Reason team is back in the US preparing to offer Ubuntu 9.04 on PCs and laptops the day Canonical’s latest Linux distribution launches. But that’s not all: Za``Reason is preparing to expand its Ubuntu server lineup. Za``Reason launched its first rack-mount Ubuntu servers in March, and Za``Reason CTO Earl Malmrose says Za``Reason will be growing that product line throughout 2009. Malmrose also noted that customers are using Za``Reason’s Untangle``Box as a server. http://www.workswithu.com/2009/04/18/zareason-readies-ubuntu-904-pcs-servers/

==== System76: Ubuntu PC Maker’s Revenue Up 61 Percent ====

Even before Ubuntu 9.04 arrives April 23, System76 has reason to celebrate. The PC maker — which specializes in Ubuntu systems — grew its first quarter 2009 revenue more than 60 percent compared to 1Q 2008,  according to System76 President Carl Richell. But Richell isn’t resting on his laurels. He’s making sure System76 is ready to catch the Ubuntu 9.04 wave — from servers to netbooks. While most major PC makers don’t yet pre-load Ubuntu on servers, Richell sees significant ongoing opportunity for System76 in the Ubuntu server sector. Any other surprises on the way from System76? You bet. Richell says the company is developing its own System76 Netbook with Ubuntu Netbook Remix Edition.

==== Open-source server distro builds on Ubuntu ====

Zaragoza, Spain-based eBox Technologies announced the availability of version 1.0 of its Ubuntu Linux-based eBox server distribution.The open source eBox 1.0 features LDAP, DHCP, NTP, DNS, and email servers, among other features, and provides a new development framework for building add-on modules. Most of eBox's code works to manage the internal communication among otherwise-independent network services. As a result, administrators can more easily manage IT infrastructure as a single unit. For example, the object-based network management system is said to enable high-level management of IP addresses, easing the administration of the firewalls and other tools.

=== Meeting Summaries ===

==== Server Team Meeting Minutes: April 14th ====

Here are the minutes of the meeting. They can also be found online with the irc logs here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MeetingLogs/Server/20090414

* Release critical bugs: mathiaz mentioned two bugs he ran into during his testing. Launchpad bug 360832 (unable to boot from the second disk of a RAID1 array - error 21) and bug 360825 (kvm 0.84 doesn’t create three drives in the guest). There was some discussion with kirkland about reproducing them so that their importance for jaunty can be set. ScottK highlighted bug 360689 (Default Ubuntu configuration is backscatter source in Jaunty). He asked ivoks for a quick review and may fix the problem between RC and release.

* ISO testing: mathiaz reminded that 9.04 RC is scheduled for Thursday. ubuntu-server isos are currently being rolled out. Testing coordination happens on the Iso testing tracker. There are 15 test cases for each iso and each testcase has a detailed description of what needs to be done. Any help in this area is welcome.

* Ideas for Karmic: mathiaz announced that while the last push for Jaunty is done ideas for the next release cycle can already be gathered. The Server team Idea pool wiki page is the place to add new ideas.

* Clamav in Jaunty: ScottK mentioned that the latest version of clamav had been uploaded to Jaunty. Packages for the backports repository have also been prepared.

* Agree on next meeting date and time: Next meeting will be on Tuesday, April 21st at 15:00 UTC in #ubuntu-meeting.

==== Ubuntu 6.06 Updates ====

* langpack-locales 2.3.18.20 - https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/dapper-changes/2009-April/012779.html

==== Ubuntu 7.10 Updates ====

* None Reported

This is the last time that Ubuntu 7.10 will be mentioned in this section.  Ubuntu 7.10 has reached its End Of Life, and no further updates will be done.  The recommendation is that those still using it should upgrade to one of the newer release versions. Note that upgrades to version 8.10 and beyond are only supported in multiple steps, via an upgrade first to 8.04 LTS, then to 8.10, and beyond.  Instructions and caveats for the upgrading may be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HardyUpgrades. Thank you for using Ubuntu 7.10.
