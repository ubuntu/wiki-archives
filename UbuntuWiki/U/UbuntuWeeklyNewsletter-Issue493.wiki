=== The Planet ===

==== Xubuntu: Integrating releases to the website ====

The Xubuntu website team have made constant improvements during 2016 with integrating releases on their website. It's finally a one-stop shop for all currently supported releases of Xubuntu. They team say that the changes not only make the website easier to use but time is saved maintaining the site.

http://xubuntu.org/news/integrating-releases-website/

==== Dimitri John Ledkov: Ubuntu Archive and CD/USB images complete migration to 4096 RSA signing keys ====

Dmitri John Ledkov writes: "Ubuntu Archive and CD/USB images use OpenPGP cryptography for verification and integrity protection." He says that back in 2012 a new archive signing key was created and since then everything has been dual-signed and that with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (Precise Pangolin) reaching EOL in April 2017, and 12.04 LTS being the last release signed with just the 1024 DSA based key, the old key is being retired. Dmitri confirms that Zesty Zapus is the first release signed only with the 4096 RSA based key.

==== Lucas Nussbaum: The Linux 2.5, Ruby 1.9 and Python 3 release management anti-pattern ====

Lucas Nussbaum writes that there is a pattern that repeats occasionally in release management of software He uses the Linux kernel, Ruby, and Python projects to prove his theory, the crux of which, is developer time being split between stable and development branches of software projects which has negative consequences on user testing and speed of stabilization, plus lost development time on backporting.

=== Other Community News ===

==== Removing 32-bit powerpc architecture from future Ubuntu releases ====

Steve Langasek announces the recent decision made by the Ubuntu Technical Board to remove support for 32-bit PowerPC architecture from the Ubuntu 17.04 (zesty) release and beyond. He cites the rationale for this decision as being: "Unlike the ppc64el architecture, there is no longer upstream support for the 32-bit, big-endian powerpc architecture; so its continuation in Ubuntu would be dependent on identifying a community of contributors willing to invest in keeping this port in working order, to carry it forward without it negatively impacting Ubuntu development as a whole."
