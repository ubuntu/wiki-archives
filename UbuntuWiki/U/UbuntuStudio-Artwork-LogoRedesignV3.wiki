__TOC__

This page is for ideas of the 3rd iteration of the Ubuntu Studio logo.

'''Logo should:'''
* Use new Ubuntu font.
* Use white for the text and the "Ubuntu Studio Blue" (#009bf9) for the C.O.F.

=== Cory K.'s Ideas ===
This current quick mockup is based on the new Ubuntu proper logo. The kerning and height is slightly different than the font. (though, the C.O.F. feels a bit heavy)

I feel this is a sophisticated look in keeping with out past and the rest of the Ubuntu line.

Here's one with the tagline (it's use would depend on scale because as-is, it's a bit small), version # and a bit of pretty.
