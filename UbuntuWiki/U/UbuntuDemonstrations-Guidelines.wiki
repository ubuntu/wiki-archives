== Description ==
Opposed to the <nowiki>[[UbuntuDemonstrations]]</nowiki> page this "sub page" is supposed to be as the title says a page with Guidelines and not supposed to be a brainstorming page, so please respect that.

Nothing is written in stone and the Guidelines will most likely change alot in the
process so don't take anything as final.

== Before doing Screencast ==

Here follows information on what todo before actually shooting the screencast. Remember that it's important to get it right from the beginning so take time to plan the screencast.

==== Content ====
* Don't ever use a heavily-modified desktop that is far from a fresh install (if the Screencast has a requirement of a previous Screencast this is no problem).

* No racism, sexism or any kind of material that people can be offended by are allowed. All screencasts are thoroughly looked at to ensure that none of the above is inside.

==== Quality ====
* Plan your Screencast thoroughly before you actually makes the final version of it. It's important that you speak clear and at a slow pace so everyone can understand what you are talking about.

* Don't be too technical if it's not necessary, after all the idea behind the screencasts are to be easy to comprehend and user-friendly, not geeky.

==== Bandwidth, Megabytes and FPS ====
Yet to come...
