== Overview ==

The HUD is a way for you to express your intent and have the application respond appropriately. We think of it as “beyond interface”, it’s the “intenterface”.  This concept of “intent-driven interface” has been a primary theme of our work in the Unity shell, with dash search as a first class experience pioneered in Unity. Now we are bringing the same vision to the application, in a way which is completely compatible with existing applications and menus.

The following blog posts and YouTube video show more detail about the HUD.

== Testing the HUD ==
Prerequisites: Make sure you are running the latest version of precise, and all your packages are up to date. 

=== Installing ===
As of Unity 5.2, HUD is integrated into Unity and does not need to be installed separately.
Command line tools are available through the package ''indicator-appmenu-tools''. It offers a number of additional tools:
* /usr/bin/hud-cli
* /usr/bin/hud-dump-application
* /usr/bin/hud-gtk
* /usr/bin/hud-list-applications
* /usr/bin/hud-verify-app-info

=== Testing ===
Invoke the HUD using the 'alt' key. The HUD interface should pop up and allow you to select menu actions.

=== Filing Bugs ===
For anything related to the user interface, ie directly unity related, file a bug against unity: '''http://bugs.launchpad.net/unity'''

When filing, tag the bug with 'HUD'.

For any issues with matching or other issues core to the tool itself, file them against the appmenu indicator.
