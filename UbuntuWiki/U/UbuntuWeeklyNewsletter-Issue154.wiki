==== Karmic Alpha 4 freeze ahead ====

The fourth Karmic alpha release is planned for next Thursday, August 13.

The team will continue to use a "soft freeze" for main for the Karmic Alpha milestones. This means that developers are asked to refrain from uploading packages between Tuesday and Thursday which don't bring us closer to releasing the alpha, so that these days can be used for settling the archive and fixing any remaining showstoppers. The list of bugs targeted for alpha-4 can be found at: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/karmic/+bugs?field.milestone=12712

Per the policy described at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RCBugTargetting, this list is used for tracking bugs that are blockers for the alpha 4 milestone - so as you can see, the list will be quite short. If you know of bugs that should be considered blockers, please nominate them for release and set the milestone target for those bugs. If you have questions about whether a bug should be considered a blocker, please contact a member of the release team. https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-release/+members

Beyond that short list of bugs that are blockers for Alpha 4, there are those bugs that are listed as release-critical for karmic as a whole: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/karmic/+bugs

==== Landscape: Canonical Systems Management and Monitoring Tool ====

Canonical has announced a new architecture and installation option for its systems management and monitoring system for Ubuntu machines - enabling enterprises to have greater local control over their deployments. Canonical’s Landscape Dedicated Server will be available to be installed on the customer's site running on their local network.

When available in late September 2009, Landscape Dedicated Server will be offered at $150 per node plus server, installation and support fees. Those interested in being the first to get updates on this as well as the latest information may register at: http://www.canonical.com/landscape-server. The Landscape hosted service is currently available for a free 60 day trial at http://www.canonical.com/landscape/register.

Landscape provides the growing number of businesses deploying multiple instances of Ubuntu on servers and desktops with the means to more easily manage and maintain their systems. The tool significantly reduces the cost of ownership and improves the efficiency of resources for any Ubuntu deployment. Landscape will now be available in two architectures: installed on-site or hosted as software as a service (SaaS) by Canonical.

Landscape Dedicated Server will install in a customer’s data center and provide all of the package management, auditing and monitoring capability of the hosted service for both physical and cloud-based Ubuntu instances.

The Landscape Dedicated Server will be able to be configured to manage systems on a network with limited or no access to the public Internet. All system configuration, policies, and profiles are stored locally on the internal infrastructure.

==== Ubuntu-PH.org is back in business ====

Finally, after 2 years, ubuntu-ph.org site is back. http://ubuntu-ph.org/ Thanks to Matthias for pointing the domain to our current host. Also thanks to the great devs behind the Lo``Co Drupal theme group. Dax will also backtrack ubuntu-ph's past (2007-2009) activities and post them on the site. Next project is getting their Lo``Co Planet back.

=== Launchpad News ===

==== First Launchpad community meet-up ====

On the 28th September, the Canonical Launchpad team leads will be in London, along with Matthew Revell, community guy Karl Fogel, and UI guy Martin Albisetti. Matthew is organising a Launchpad community meet-up for the evening of the 28th, which will be a chance to meet other Launchpad types, including several of Canonical’s Launchpad engineers. There are a couple of different venues being considered at the moment but it’ll most likely be a pub in central London, and fairly informal.

http://blog.launchpad.net/general/first-launchpad-community-meet-up

==== Code Hosting quick-start guide ====

If you want to host code on Launchpad, and you need some help, you can turn to IRC, the launchpad-users mailing list or the Code Hosting section on the help wiki. https://help.launchpad.net/Code

If all you want, though, is to get up and running with hosting your project’s code on Launchpad, there’s now a quick-start guide. It leaves out any detail that might distract from simply getting you started. https://help.launchpad.net/Code/QuickStart

So, here’s the question: does it do the job? If not, what should be put in or left out? You can leave your comments at the link below.

==== Mirco Müller: notify-osd 0.9.16 released ====

The latest tarball-release of notify-osd is out and includes quite a few major changes.

* further preparation for refactoring of class Bubble and Stack
* mem-leak fixes and fix for LP: #378193 by Alexander Sack
* much code-refactoring
* adapted to 0.10 fd.o spec
* lots of autotools-related fixes and improvements
* added ATK interface by Eitan Isaacson
* fix by Chow Loong Jin for LP: #401809
* added support for image_data and image_path

There’s still some way to go until notify-osd shows up in Karmic, and the next changes will be more interesting for users.

==== Dustin Kirkland: Migrating to an Encrypted Home Directory ====

Many eCryptfs and Ubuntu Jaunty users have requested instructions on migrating their existing, non-encrypted home directories to an Encrypted-Home setup. Dustin has provided us with some instructions! You can see the full set of instructions at the link.

http://blog.dustinkirkland.com/2009/06/migrating-to-encrypted-home-directory.html

==== Amit Kucheria: Touchscreen = Fail? ====

Do you have a touchscreen that isn't working in Ubuntu? We need your help!

We are trying to get as many touchscreens working as possible for Karmic. Bug #317094 (https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xf86-input-evtouch/+bug/317094) is attempting to collect hardware information about these them. As a first step, we'd like to enable the ones that can use the in-kernel usbtouchscreen driver.

* Do you have a touchscreen?
* Is it connected over USB? (lsusb is your friend)
* Get the vendor and product id of the USB touchscreen (lsub)
* Load the usbtouchscreen module and add the new id to it through sysfs

A made-up example follows (I don't have a touchscreen handy, sorry!)

* example output from lsusb

Bus 005 Device 002: ID 0483:2016 SGS Thomson Microelectronics Fingerprint Reader

* 0483 is the vendor id, 2016 is the product id
* sudo modprobe usbtouchscreen
* sudo sh -c "echo 0483 2016 > /sys/bus/usb/drivers/usbtouchscreen/new_id"

Replace the vendor and product id with what you found from lsusb.

If this makes your touchscreen work in Karmic, please reply to the bug mentioned above with the ids and name of the touchscreen.

=== In The Press ===

==== Canonical Expands Ubuntu Linux Landscape ====

Internet``News.com's Sean Michael Kerner says that while there is a mad rush toward putting more IT resources in the cloud, not everything belongs in the cloud -- just ask Ubuntu Linux vendor Canonical. The Canonical Landscape Ubuntu systems management server is now moving in from the cloud with a new dedicated, on-site offering. "Canonical's Landscape Dedicated Server is a software appliance that is installed on the users' hardware. Updates will be made available by download on an as-needed basis when major kernel/security patches become available," Ken Drachnik, Landscape manager at Canonical, told Internet``News.com. "Of course, this points out one of the major differences between the Hosted edition and Dedicated edition -- users will need to provide hardware and a trained resource to manage Landscape on-site." http://www.internetnews.com/dev-news/article.php/3833111/Canonical+Expands+Ubuntu+Linux+Landscape.htm

==== Canonical removes middleman from Ubuntu management ====

Timothy Prickett Morgan of The Register reports that Canonical is offering a dedicated, local version of its Landscape systems management and monitoring server for Ubuntu, rather than insist you access the service through the company's own systems. Canonical will next month launch the Landscape Dedicated Server, which is a local copy of the current Landscape service. It will run inside the data center, giving IT managers some piece of mind about security. Launched in March 2008 to help deploy monitor, manage and patch large numbers of Ubuntu servers or PCs, Landscape wasn't a service you bought from Canonical. Instead you accessed it through a web interface and portal. Landscape does more than just monitor physical machines individually or in groups. It can also control the deployment of applications from the Ubuntu repository to machines individually or in groups. And if Ubuntu shops want to create their own Ubuntu spin with its own repositories and deploy them on boxes, Landscape can do this as well. The Landscape service is priced $150 per machine per year if you want to just purchase it by itself, but if you buy a normal support contract for Ubuntu Linux for a PC or server, Landscape access comes with the price of that support contract. http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/08/04/ubuntu_landscape_desktop/

==== The Official Ubuntu Server Book ====

Paul Ferrill of Linux Planet thinks that a newbie system administrator that might not have a system working or connected to the Internet but needs help getting a problem solved would find a good basic book like The Official Ubuntu Server Book handy. This recent release from Prentice Hall comes in several versions including a Barnes & Noble Special Edition with extra content. One good measure of a book of this type is the length of the index. "The Official Ubuntu Server Book" checks in at 501 pages with 48 dedicated to the index. List price for this book is $39.99, but you can pick it up on the B&N site for a good bit less. It also includes a 45-day pass to an online version available through Safari.com. This book is definitely worth the money if you need a good reference to help you over the newbie Linux admin hump. http://www.linuxplanet.com/linuxplanet/reviews/6815/1/

==== No Intel Poulsbo Driver For Ubuntu 9.10 ====

Michael Larabel of Phoronix thinks that Intel's Poulsbo driver for their GMA 500 IGP on the SCH U15W is a bloody mess. Unlike their X.Org driver for their other Intel IGPs, the Poulsbo driver is closed-source since Intel licensed some of the technologies for this graphics processor, but the problems go beyond just whether or not you like to use a binary blob. Intel hasn't done a good job at maintaining this driver and ensuring it works with the latest kernel and X.Org releases, and tracking down all of the components to use the driver on a non-supported distribution can be challenging. Originally the Intel Poulsbo driver was found with Ubuntu where those using Mark Shuttleworth's operating system could get this driver working with not so many steps. However, that will not be the case with Ubuntu 9.10. Canonical's David Mandala, who serves as the manager of the Ubuntu Mobile project, shared an interesting statement on the ubuntu-devel list: there will be no Poulsbo support in Ubuntu 9.10. Intel is not interested in supporting Ubuntu 9.10 and as a result their proprietary driver will not work or be included with this next Ubuntu release known as the Karmic Koala. http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=NzQzMg

==== Torvalds and Shuttleworth to speak at LinuxCon 2009 ====

The inaugural Linux``Con organized by the Linux Foundation is set to become the biggest Linux gathering of 2009. Scheduled for next month, September 21-23, in Portland, Oregon, the event will draw some of the best and the brightest that the Linux community has to offer. No less than Linus Torvalds and Mark Shuttleworth among other industry experts will speak at Linux``Con. Just about anyone who is interested in Linux can join. Early registration is available until August 15. http://www.junauza.com/2009/08/torvalds-and-shuttleworth-among-many.html

==== Ubuntu: Patent Policy and Private Support ====

Linux Pro Magazine's Marcel Hilzinger reports that Ubuntu has introduced a new Patent Policy to help developers and rights holders deal with software patent issues. With the Private Support, Canonical hopes to improve its revenue. Its new Patent Policy is designed to avoid such problems as far as possible. The policy lists the steps developers and rights holders should take when faced with a possible breach in patent. One clause contained in the policy states that, if Canonical has not heard from the alleged rights holder for an extended period of time and the patent is near expiration, the code will continue to be shipped as normal. http://www.linuxpromagazine.com/Online/News/Ubuntu-Patent-Policy-and-Private-Support

=== In The Blogosphere ===

==== Canonical’s Ubuntu Server Edition Gains ISV Support ====

Joe Panettieri of Works With U discusses the Independent Software Vender (ISV) support for Ubuntu Server Edition.  He first notes that Open``Bravo ERP 2.50 Professional Subscription and Alfresco Community Edition 3.2 are both on board.  In addition, he notes the Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud and the fact that Hewlett-Packard began certifying Pro``Liant servers to run Ubuntu Server Edition recently.  Not yet a powerhouse, but definitely progress in the server market.  See his report at:  http://www.workswithu.com/2009/08/06/canonicals-ubuntu-server-edition-gains-isv-support/

==== Coming Soon: Landscape Dedicated Server for Ubuntu ====

Joe Panettieri, writing for Works With U, looks at the latest change in Landscape.  Now, along with being a Software as a Service (SaaS) Ubuntu is releasing it as a dedicated server at a reasonable price.  This change will make it easier for those who don't want their information on the cloud, or those with only intermittent internet connections to make use of Landscape to organize and maintain their company computers.  His article covers his observations, at:  http://www.workswithu.com/2009/08/07/coming-soon-landscape-dedicated-server-for-ubuntu/

==== Reader Polls: Google Is Both Ubuntu Rival, Friend ====

Joe Panettieri looks at two Works With U polls that question Google's relationship to Ubuntu.  First was "Canonical’s top competitor", and though the top results were fairly obvious it was interesting to note that Google was in third place.  The second was whether Google’s Chrome would help or hurt Ubuntu.  Here, the figures weren't as clear-cut, but a good chunk felt that it would help Ubuntu.  See his rational at:  http://www.workswithu.com/2009/08/03/reader-polls-google-is-both-ubuntu-rival-friend/

==== Rethinking Ubuntu’s Update Policy…Or Not ====

Christopher Tozzi, writing for Works With U, takes a look at Ubuntu's current policy on updating applications.  At the present time new releases of such applications are held until the next Ubuntu release, in order to keep stability and lack of regression to a minimum in a particular release.  He notes that while this may upset some users, those with the need or interest to upgrade an application usually know how to find it and perform the upgrade themselves.  Whereas the ones that are less inclined will maintain a stable environment in which to operate.  His conclusions are available at:  http://www.workswithu.com/2009/08/05/rethinking-ubuntus-update-policyor-not/

==== Shuttleworth wants Debian/Ubuntu co-operation ====

Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols, the Cyber Cynic of the Computerworld blogs, notes that the flame war is back on.  This time the sticking point appears to be the timed-releases that Ubuntu uses and the fact that Debian has gone to a 2 year cycle, themselves.  Vaughan-Nichols makes the observation that all Mark Shuttleworth is doing is exactly what Debian founder Ian Murdock tried to propose back in 2005.  He also notes that it's really just one segment of the Debian developers that are causing the "sound and fury" over the development cycle, and these appear to be the same ones that have always been in contention with the idea of Ubuntu being built on the Debian distribution.  See his article at:  http://blogs.computerworld.com/14499/shuttleworth_wants_debian_ubuntu_co_operation
