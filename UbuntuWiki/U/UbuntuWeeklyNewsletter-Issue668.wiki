==== Trying wayland by default again ====

Sebastien Bacher (seb128) advises that as several old blockers have been removed for the adoption of Wayland, and time permits testing and feedback prior to the next LTS release, it is time to try again. The thread will remain open for user feedback while bugs are to be reported to launchpad.

==== Linux distributors frustrated by Google's new Chromium web browser restrictions ====

Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols writes that Google recently discovered unnamed Chromium-based browsers had integrated Google cloud-based features, which has resulted in Google announcing they will limit access to many Chrome APIs starting 15 March 2021. Giving many specifics, we are then reminded how difficult it is packaging chromium for Linux distributions, quoting our own Alan Pope. Comments from various distribution packagers are provided, including "no one on the Chrome team understands the concept of open source", with clear signs that many are unhappy. It's suspected the number unhappy may grow once users have received their updated chromium without these features.
