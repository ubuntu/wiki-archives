He concludes the post mortem with an apology for the security breach, the data leak, and downtime.

==== 10 things we love about Ubuntu 13/5 things we hate ====

Maria Korolov of Network World writes that Ubuntu Raring Ringtail (13.04) is billed as being business- and user-friendly. There are still obstacles to its widespread adoption, but if employees only access applications via the browser, and a company doesn't use complex spreadsheet macros or document formats, then Raring Ringtail might be worth considering. She presents a slide show to illustrate "10 things we love about Ubuntu 13 and 5 things we hate."

==== NVIDIA's Linux Driver On Ubuntu Is Very Competitive With Windows 8 ====

Michael Larabel of Phoronix shares benchmarks of the recent NVIDIA Linux Driver for Ubuntu and concludes: “The Nouveau driver performance was generally very slow, but that's to be expected besides its other shortcomings. Overall, if you're using the binary NVIDIA Linux driver (or on Solaris and FreeBSD too) the level of feature support and performance should be comparable to that of Microsoft Windows.”
