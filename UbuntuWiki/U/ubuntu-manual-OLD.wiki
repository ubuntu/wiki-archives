== Getting Started with Ubuntu 10.04 ==

''Getting Started with Ubuntu 10.04'' is a complete beginners manual for Ubuntu, featuring comprehensive guides, How Tos and information on anything you need to know after first installing Ubuntu.

Designed to be as user-friendly and easy to follow as possible, it should provide the first point of reference to any Ubuntu newcomer with lots of information in one easy to access PDF file. Plus, every six months there will be a new revision released to coincide with each new release of Ubuntu.

The manual is written and maintained by the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-manual|Ubuntu Manual Team.]]</nowiki>

==== Team Mission Statement ====

To create and deploy a document that is suitable as first point of
reference regarding the use of Ubuntu by beginner-level users.

In addition to the system software, it shall also discuss a few selected
applications that are part of the default installation, as there is
assumed to be a common interest among beginner-level users. It will also give
detail on installation, hardware, security, a background on FOSS and Ubuntu and
give an introduction to using the command line.

The document shall be ready for the upcoming Ubuntu 10.04 release and be
updated for every following release (6 month cycle).

==== Key Dates for the 0.0 series (Lucid) ====

The project development schedule for Lucid Lynx is split into four main milestone releases:

===== Alpha Release =====

February 10th, 2010 - Version 0.3
 This release should have the basics of all 10 chapters in place, in rough draft format. All of the text should be in place and roughly formatted, but images probably won't be. Formatting and Styles will still need to be confirmed and implemented fully in the beta release.

https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu-manual/+spec/alpha-release

===== Beta Release and Writing Freeze =====

March 31st 2010 - Version 0.6
 In this release, the content of the manual should represent what it will look like in the final release - all references, links and images should be in place, and final formatting, color scheme and styles should start to take shape. Translations should be well on their way to completion.

====== Associated deadlines: ======
* Ubuntu Manual content freeze:       21st March 2010
* Ubuntu Manual writing freeze:        31st March 2010
* Ubuntu Manual beta release:          31st March 2010

https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu-manual/+spec/beta-release

===== Release Candidate =====

April 20th 2010 - Version 0.9
 This release will include any last minute changes that will be present in Lucid Lynx that we didn't already know about. All links and references, including statistics, will be checked and updated in case anything has changed. The final styles and formatting of the manual should be completed by now. Someone has to run through every single instruction given to the reader to make sure that the instructions all work!

https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu-manual/+spec/release-candidate

===== Final Release =====

April 29th 2010 - Version 1.0
 This will be the final release, where the manual is rendered to .pdf and distributed in multiple languages. Everything should be 100% accurate and fully verified to work, it should be suitable for mainstream consumption.

* community based
* features selected screenshots
* able to be output in many formats (PDF, HTML5 etc)
