==== Data mining in Launchpad ====

Inspired by trouble that users have had due to misconfigured grub configuration files, Brian Murray shares that Launchpad facilitates developers by letting them grab attachments from bug reports to analyze them locally with the  lp-grab-attachments tool, part of the lpltools package.

==== Ubuntu One Vs Dropbox: Has Ubuntu One Lost The Personal Cloud Market? ====

Swapnil Bhartiya of Muktware does a review of Ubuntu One compared to several other available online storage options, including Dropbox, Sky``Drive, Spider Oak and Google Drive. He notes that one “of the reasons Ubuntu One is not the preferred cloud for GNU/Linux users is that it’s not available for other GNU/Linux distributions. Ironically it’s available even for Windows (they are also working on a Mac client) but not for competing Linux distributions.” Ubuntu developers claim that code is available and other distro developers can package Ubuntu one for their distrosbut Bhartiya argues that Ubuntu/Canonical is the one who shlould be in charge for packaging due to increment of Ubuntu one users.
