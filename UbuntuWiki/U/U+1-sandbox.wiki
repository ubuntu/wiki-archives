=== Ubuntu Development Version Testing Wiki ===

This wiki page serves as a home base for the U+1 testing team

=== About the Team ===

<nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=427|UbuntuForums.org]]</nowiki> hosts a sub-forum dedicated to Ubuntu Development Releases. This sub-form is open to any one that has a question about the current development version. When that version is released, threads are either closed, or moved to another part of the forum.From 2009 to the present some users have naturally gathered at this sub-forum to report and discuss their experiences with Ubuntu Development Releases: opinions, bugs found and, sometimes, even workarounds.

''' What is a Tester? '''
 
Some of these users gradually defined themselves as '''"testers"''' and engaged into uncoordinated and individual tasks related to testing the development releases of Ubuntu. A Ubuntu+1 tester is typically an individual with some Linux and Ubuntu experience, and enough skills to understand and solve problems and challenges presented when running unstable software. Doing so, these testers automatically create a knowledge base, spread into hundreds of threads and posts, regarding the specificities of the release under development. It's not unusual to see that, once a development cycle ends and a final version of Ubuntu is released, Ubuntu+1 testers jump into the common support areas of UbuntuForums (as well as other forums – including international ones) and share advanced knowledge about the new release. Having used, tested and discussed such releases since day one of alpha stage, their expertise on its particularities is not unexpected.
