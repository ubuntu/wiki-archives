==== GNOME Shell 41 in Ubuntu 22.04 ====

Daniel Van Vugt thanks Marco Trevisan for getting GNOME Shell 41 into Ubuntu 22.04 last week, noting that mutter 41.2 "has enabled support for NVIDIA's GBM backend". We are told how we can check that the path for Wayland sessions is being used.

https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/gnome-shell-41-in-ubuntu-22-04/26435

==== Proposal: GNOME Connections as default remote desktop client ====

Jeremy Bicha proposes that the "default remote desktop client be switched from Remmina to the new GNOME Connections app". Providing a brief history, the discussion includes: features, availability, dependencies, as well as including a screendump to Connections. Jeremy is asking for feedback from those who use RDP or VNC.

==== Focal Fossa (20.04.4 LTS) Point-Release Status Tracking ====

Łukasz Zemczak has started the Focal Fossa (20.04.4 LTS) Point-Release Status Tracking document, which will be updated with the status, summary, any blockers or bugs to watch, plus a release checklist. This document will be updated as required until Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS is finally released.

https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/focal-fossa-20-04-4-lts-point-release-status-tracking/26490

==== Accessibility Testers Needed - Web Site and Flutter Installer ====

Monica Ayhens-Madon reminds us that Ubuntu should be available and accessible to everyone. Admitting this has 'slipped' recently, we are told Canonical has returned focus to this goal, and are thus requesting contributors who use screen readers. We are briefly introduced to Scott Mason Nash, and Ken Van``Dine who need the input from contributors and testers, and who will happily reply to any questions in this thread.

==== Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Integrating systemd-oomd For Improving Low Memory Handling ====

Michael Larabel tells us Ubuntu 22.04 LTS will be using systemd-oomd, which is triggered before the Linux kernel's OOM (out-of-memory) killer. We are told it's not yet found on dailies, but is only an 'apt install' away, and given some history of systemd--oomd, along with links if we require more details.

==== KDE Falkon 3.2 Web Browser Released with Screen Capture Support, Many Improvements ====

Marius Nestor reports that the KDE Project's Falkon browser has been updated to version 3.2. Marius notes that whilst it started as a browser intended for educational purposes, it's now becoming full featured and competes with Mozilla Firefox. We are told of some of the improvements, shown a screen capture, and provided a link for the release announcement page.

==== x86 Straight Line Speculation Mitigation Being Back-Ported To GCC 11 ====

Michael Larabel provides the patch mitigation for the x86 straight-line speculation vulnerability. He further advises that the patch is backported to the GCC 11 stable series and will be available in the upcoming GCC 11.3 point release.

==== NVIDIA 510.47.03 Linux Driver Released With Vulkan 1.3 Support, RTX 3050 Compatibility ====

Michael Larabel writes that NVIDIA has released their first stable version of NVIDIA 510 linux driver (510.47.03). We are reminded of some of the features of the prior 'beta' driver, are told it's a nice update with Vulkan 1.3 support, and provided a link to download this driver.

==== Xfce’s Apps Update for January 2022: New Releases of Ristretto, CPU Freq Plugin, and More ====

Marius Nestor provides the January 2022 "Xfce Apps Update" of what is new from the Xfce project. We are told updates include numerous improvements to Ristretto image version 0.12.2, CPU Freq plugin 1.2.6 & Indicator plugin for the Xfce panel, and major work has been done on Tumbler D-Bus thumbnailing service as work progresses on Xfce 4.18. Links for more details are provided.

==== NVIDIA Linux Gaming Performance For Wayland vs. X.Org On Ubuntu 22.04 ====

Michael Larabel starts by telling us that NVIDIA's newly introduced 510 driver series, paired with the latest XWayland, and GNOME/Mutter can deliver "comparable performance to a traditional X.Org session". We are told NVIDIA Wayland support with GBM has "stabilized", and are given benchmarks using the current Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, contrasting GNOME with X.Org and GNOME Wayland sessions.

==== Ubuntu MATE 22.04 Will Include Flatpak by Default ====

Joey Sneddon reports that "Flatpak support will be included in Ubuntu MATE 22.04 out of the box". Joey reports that "all required desktop integrations with portals are present and working by default". Joey notes where he discovered this, and that no official announcement has yet been made. He gives some thoughts on what he feels this means, and what he has discovered in respect to Flatpak-friendly features for those users who are using the Ubuntu MATE 22.04 LTS alpha.
