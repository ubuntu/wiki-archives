==== Intrepid Ibex Alpha 6 released ====

Welcome to Intrepid Ibex Alpha-6, which will in time become Ubuntu 8.10. Alpha 6 is the sixth in a series of milestone CD images released throughout the Intrepid development cycle. The Alpha images are known to be reasonably
free of show stopper CD build or installer bugs, while representing a very recent snapshot of Intrepid. You can download it here:

* http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/intrepid/alpha-6/ (Ubuntu)
* http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/edubuntu/releases/intrepid/alpha-6/ (Ubuntu Education Edition)
* http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/releases/intrepid/alpha-6/ (Kubuntu)
* http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/xubuntu/releases/intrepid/alpha-6/ (Xubuntu)
* http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntustudio/releases/intrepid/alpha-6/ (UbuntuStudio)

Pre-releases of Intrepid are *not* encouraged for anyone needing a stable system or anyone who is not comfortable running into occasional, even frequent breakage. They are, recommended for Ubuntu developers, and those who want to help in testing, reporting, and fixing bugs. Alpha 6 includes a number of software updates that are ready for large-scale testing.  Please refer to http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/intrepid/alpha6 for information on changes in Ubuntu. https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel-announce/2008-September/000487.html

==== Codecs and DVD playback on Ubuntu 8.04 for all users ====

For the first time we are making codecs for media playback and a DVD player, from our partners at Fluendo and Cyberlink, available through the Ubuntu store. We have had relationships with these companies for a while and to date we have offered their products to our hardware partners as pre-install options.

Though, we are making them available to all users. It is important to us that no matter how you choose to access Ubuntu, pre-installed or as a free download, that you can have a similarly rich experience. The vast majority of our current users will have installed Ubuntu themselves. These users should also be allowed legal DVD and media playback and so we have built a way of letting them do this.

Ubuntu cannot ship codecs through the distro, as they are not free to redistribute. So we have built a restricted download area that is accessible through the store. Once purchased you can find your software here which will then install in the familiar hassle-free way that Ubuntu users appreciate. A pretty cool feature is that, should you wipe out your machine you can go back to the restricted download area and access your codecs again. http://blog.canonical.com/?p=37

==== Xubuntu News ====

The Xubuntu Team is happy to announce several important additions and shuffles within the Xubuntu Team:

Pasi Lallinaho(knome) of Helsinki, Finland - a user of Xubuntu and Xfce4 on his desktop for well over a year now has joined the team as the new Xubuntu Marketing Lead. Having founded his own business solutions and services company at the age of 20, this 22 year old entrepreneur/software engineer/artist/web design professional/jack-of-all-trades will be a huge asset to Xubuntu in helping to grow a strong marketing and artwork community. Pasi is no stranger to the Open Source community, having contributed to Amarok for close to two years. He has already jumped in with both feet by beginning the process of giving our website a much needed face lift and creating a countdown banner for the Intrepid release.

Jannis Pohlmann(JPohlmann) is a 23 year old computer science student and musician living in Lübeck, Germany. Jannis, an Xfce developer, is well known for his development contributions to the Xfce4 project, Lunar Linux, and maintainer of the Xfce4 goodies project. Jannis will be joining the team as the official liaison between the Xubuntu and Xfce4 projects and will assist in maximizing collaboration and communication.

Michael Casadevall(NCommander), who recently joined the Xubuntu Developer ranks, has agreed to take on the role of being our liaison with the Debian Xfce4 developers. In addition to his work as a developer, Michael will assist the Xubuntu project in a similar fashion to Jannis by helping maximizing collaboration and communication with our upstream Debian counterparts.

Vincent Tunro(vinnl), who is a long time Xubuntu contributor and Xubuntu website editor, has accepted the role of leading our efforts to develop the website. Vincent's primary responsibilities will be to ensure that the website is updated regularly with news stories and new content; perform administrative duties such as managing and giving direction to the other website editors; he will also help keep the website "fresh" in general.

=== In The Press ===

* Asus Eee PC 1000 Plus Ubuntu: Big Power in a Small Package - Paul Ferrill describes the Asus Eee PC 1000, that comes with a 1.6 GHz Intel Atom processor, 1 GB memory, a 40 GB Solid State Drive and a 1.3 MP camera. Also included is network support through a 10/100 Ethernet connection or 802.11n wireless, and Bluetooth. This machine comes with Ubuntu 8.04, Open``Office.org, Firefox 3.01, F-Spot photo management, Pidgin instant messenger client and Cheese for taking photos.  Other availabilities are handled by Synaptic package manager, including security updates and additional software. http://www.linuxplanet.com/linuxplanet/reviews/6536/1/

* Battle Brews Over Firefox in Ubuntu 8.10 - Michael Larabel of Phoronix reports that Mozilla Firefox 3.0.2, which is slated for inclusion in Intrepid, will require users to accept an End-User License Agreement (EULA). Mark Shuttleworth weighed in on the subject stating the EULA is a reasonable requirement and that Mozilla is simply protecting their trademark. In fact, Ubuntu has similar guidelines about use of their  Trademark. A number of users are not pleased and state that “mandating this EULA is going too far”. Shuttleworth also states that "abrowser", a new package in Intrepid, will use only the codebase behind Firefox and therefore avoid the need for a EULA.  http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=NjcxOA

* Shuttleworth defends Firefox licence in Ubuntu - In response to some of the criticism that's been going around about the EULA for Firefox, Mark Shuttleworth wrote, "Mozilla Corporation asked that this be added in order for us to continue to call the browser 'Firefox'." Stating that since Firefox is their trademark, which we intend to respect, we have the choice of working with Mozilla to meet their requirements or switching to an unbranded browser. Shuttleworth added that a package called "abrowser" was being developed in Intrepid Ibex which uses Firefox's code base without the Firefox trademark.  http://news.zdnet.co.uk/software/0,1000000121,39488217,00.htm?r=1

* Is Ubuntu about to become yet another restrictive commercial OS? - The author of DC: Infowarrior and Xubuntuphile is contesting the selling of licenses to popular multimedia codecs. The concern voiced on his site is that these commercial, proprietary codecs would eventually be rolled into the actual release instead of the open source software that accomplishes the same goals.  He quotes an article by Kristin Shoemaker and one by Gerry Carr, the Marketing Manager at Canonical. http://darthchaosofrspw.wordpress.com/2008/09/21/is-ubuntu-about-to-become-yet-another-restrictive-commercial-os/

* Ubuntu's Bullet``Proof``X Takes Simpler Step Forward - Michael Larabel has taken a look at the Bullet``Proof``X that's been included in Intrepid Ibex, and finds it to be much easier to solve problems with graphic card configurations and troubleshooting. Instead of a simple statement that there was a problem that needed to be fixed, now it offers you the option of viewing the xserver log, viewing the startup errors or editing the configuration file. He feels this is a major step forward. http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=ubuntu_bulletproofx_2&num=2

* Kroah-Hartman Attacks Canonical - Kristian Kissling, for Linux Magazine, reports that Greg Kroah-Hartman feels that Canonical has only released .01% of the total number of patches to the kernel. On the other hand, Matt Zimmerman felt that Kroah-Hartman's statistics were flawed through including such things as GCC, binutils, X.org and Glibc in with the Linux kernel, and in disregarding the desktop stack (GNOME and KDE). In addition, Zimmerman notes that Kroah-Hartman has a link with Novell, who is a Canonical competitor. http://www.linux-magazine.com/online/news/kroah_hartman_attacks_canonical

* Toshiba NB100 netbook announced for the UK - Amy-Mae Elliott reports on the latest Toshiba offering in the UK: a 8.9 inch offered with either Ubuntu 8.04 and Open``Office.org 2.4 or another proprietary system. Available October 2008, the netbook includes a 1.6GHz Intel Atom CPU, wifi, ethernet port, 3 USB ports, a 0.3MP webcam and a 120 GB hard drive. http://www.pocket-lint.co.uk/news/news.phtml/17730/18754/toshiba-nb100-netbook-uk.phtml

=== In The Blogosphere ===

* Updated: Meet 120 Companies Running Ubuntu Linux - Works With U is striving to identify 1,000 businesses and organizations across the globe that run Ubuntu on servers, desktops, laptops or mobile devices. The fast-growing list of Ubuntu adopters — known as the Works With U 1000 — now includes law firms, technology companies, universities, real estate firms, media companies, financial services firms, and other types of organizations from across the globe. Take a look at the current Works With U 1000 list[1], or add your company to the list by filling out their quick survey[2]. http://www.workswithu.com/2008/09/16/updated-meet-120-companies-running-ubuntu-linux/

* Can Ubuntu Overcome The Status Quo? – Toby Deemer on the Works With U blog posts that much of the hesitance in people accepting Ubuntu, and Linux in general is caused by Ubuntu and Linux being different, and whether people can appreciate what that different might be better. As a case in point, Toby relates the story of how he help his wife move to Ubuntu. In order to make his wife feel a bit more comfortable he customized Gnome to resemble Windows. Once comfortable with Ubuntu he purchased his wife an eeePC running Xandros. Toby runs Ubuntu and administers a large MS Active Directory environment at work and his wife works in education full of Windows and OS X machines. Neither has a problem integrating into their respective environments. The only issue so far is a Lexmark printer at home…Lexmark has yet to write Linux drivers.  http://www.workswithu.com/2008/09/16/can-ubuntu-overcome-the-status-quo/

* Pimp your Blackberry with the Ubuntu Theme! - While we can't run Ubuntu on our Blackberries, blogger defcon shows us how we can make it look like we are. defcon provides us links to Dr. Devious' Blackberry Pearl theme that duplicates the Ubuntu Hardy look and feel. This handy theme also shows new mail and calendar items at a glance. Combined these provide Blackberry users with a great looking and very helpful theme! http://www.ubuntu-unleashed.com/2008/09/ubuntu-theme-on-your-blackberry.html

* Bureaucracy - Ubuntu kernel manager Pete Graner responds to a comment on his blog about the Kernel Team requiring an Launchpad bug being filed prior to committing patch to the tree. Graner explains that requiring a Launchpad bug being filed isn't about bureaucracy, it's about accountability. Without an Launchpad bug being filed then more problems may arise when people cannot remember why a patch was received. Filing the bug report helps the Kernel Team to manage proper change controls and improve the kernel in a well documented manner. http://blog.redvoodoo.org/2008/09/bureaucracy.html

* Memo to Canonical and Ubuntu: Stop Chasing Apple Mac OS X - Blogger Joe Panettieri is concerned with the focus that Canonical CEO Mark Shuttleworth is putting on the future direction of Ubuntu. Panettieri is especially worried that by going after the design and polish of Apple's OSX that other more important factors, such as wireless networking functioning properly on install, may not get the attention they truly deserve. He is further concerned about the lack of Ubuntu branding on systems shipped with Ubuntu, and with naming confusion over the many varieties of Ubuntu. Developing a more elegant OS is a worthy goal, but Panettieri suggests that the basics need to be worked out first. http://www.workswithu.com/2008/09/15/memo-to-canonical-and-ubuntu-stop-chasing-apple-mac-os-x/

==== The OLPC PH Special Interest Group at Software Freedom Day 2008 Quezon City, Philippines ====

Jerome Gotangco in his "Engage the World" blog highlights the festivities of the Software Freedon Day at the National Computer Center in Quezon City. In year’s past, Jerome involved himself with promoting Ubuntu, but this year he turned his attention to One Laptop Per Child.  The XO-1 was a highlight and many asked, “When is it coming to the Philippines” and, “Does it run Ubuntu?”.  Jerome states that using the XO-1 has made people realize its difference from the Netbooks and UMPCs currently on the market.  “-create magic and inspire people!  That’s the best result any SFD or advocacy can achieve”.
