=== How and where do we organize user contributed artwork for Ubuntu Studio ? ===

There *should* be a centralized and easy-to-use site for User Created Content (UCC).  There is considerable activity on DeviantArt for Ubuntu wallpapers in general.  There was some activity on Spreadubuntu, but the sparse usage suggests that it is not the go-to source or solution.

A persistent landing page and regular contests announced on that page would help centralize the presently scattered content.
