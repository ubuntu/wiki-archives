==== The Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious Scorpionfish. Not. ====

Mark Shuttleworth congratulates the entire extended Ubuntu community for the 13.04 release and reveals the codename for the next Ubuntu release: Saucy Salamander. “The salamander is one of nature’s most magical creatures; they are a strong indicator of a pristine environment, which is a fitting way to describe the new world emerging around Ubuntu Touch. [...] And we’re saucy too – life’s too short to be stodgy or stilted”, states Shuttleworth.
