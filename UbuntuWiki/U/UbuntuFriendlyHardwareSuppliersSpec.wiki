=== Summary ===

Promote Ubuntu and its Hardware Certification Program to hardware suppliers by encouraging members of the Ubuntu community to contact and list them.

=== Rationale ===

Encouraging existing and potential customers to tell hardware suppliers about Ubuntu will send a strong message, amplifying any Canonical initiatives.

=== Use cases ===

Pingu, a member of the Antarctic Loco``Team tries to think of ways the team can promote Ubuntu.  He finds the Marketing page which points to the "Ubuntu Friendly Hardware Suppliers" initiative with guidance and templates ready to adopt.  He tells the team at their next meeting, they set up a wiki page to record their results and get to work.

Anne loves using Ubuntu and decides to look for ways she can help the project.  She finds the initiative, drafts a letter from the template and drops it into her local Computer shop.  After she leaves the store manager thinks "Gee, I'd better contact Head Office about this."

=== Scope ===

Provision of templates for communicating with suppliers and some guidance on coordinating the process (if desired).
