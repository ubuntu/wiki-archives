== Calling All Mentors! ==
We are opening the application period for all people interested in mentoring LoCo Teams.  Out there -- right now -- there is a LoCo team in the US who could use your help!  Head on over to the <nowiki>[[USTeams-Mentors | Mentors Page]]</nowiki> to sign up.  We approve new mentors at each scheduled meeting.

== About ==

This is the central team for all Ubuntu LoCoTeams in the United States. We are the collective of groups of volunteers and activists throughout the U.S. organized around the Ubuntu operating system. We advocate <nowiki>[[DigitalFreedom|digital freedom]]</nowiki> and promote Ubuntu as a means of achieving this.

== Goals ==
Currently different states have had better success at getting up and running than other teams. This is most likely due to poor communication and lack of resources or know-how.  We hope that with the cooperation of successful teams and struggling teams everyone can become stronger. 
# Have an established team for every state in the US
# Assist new teams to become approved
# Exist as a central resource to all US teams
