__TOC__

A place where we record any patches we've sent upstream or projects that we've created based on work we were doing for Ubuntu One. This team has a LOT more open source work that it's involved in, this list tries to limit itself to patches/projects that were originally written for Ubuntu One, or that are used by Online Services. So a patch to PQM or bzr or python-boto should be listed, but a patch to a project that we don't use would not be listed.
