Hey There!

I'm Uri, a senior year HUJI (Hebrew University of Jerusalem) B.A Student in Political Science and Education.

I consider myself a happy Ubuntu user since April 2007. In my "spare time" I'm doing my best to contribute to the Hebrew Translation Team of Ubuntu Israel. 
Proudly acclaimed "End-User" of the Ubuntu system - I'm a pure layman when it comes to programming languages. Maybe one day I'll do something about it... :)

Specs: Dell 'crappy touchpad' Inspiron 1525 Laptop
