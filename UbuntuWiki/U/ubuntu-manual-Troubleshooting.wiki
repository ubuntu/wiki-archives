Here is where you can plan what common questions and solutions you will include in the troubleshooting chapter.

Go nuts! When you think you've got a good 10-20 questions, get one of the admins to have a look - either me (Benjamin Humphrey), Jamin Day, Josh Holland or Joe Burgess.

* How can I change the video resolution? (gui only) DONE
* Grabbing ttf (windows fonts) DONE
