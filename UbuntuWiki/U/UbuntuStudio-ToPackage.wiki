=== Package Update Requests ===
If you would like to request an existing package to be updated, please file a bug on <nowiki>[[http://www.launchpad.net/ubuntu/|Launchpad]]</nowiki> and assign it to ubuntustudio-dev.

== Packaging Timeline ==
'''New deadline to get packages in REVU...'''

We are aiming to get any new packages in before Gutsy's Tribe 3.
We would also like to see all our sources pushed into our Launchpad product's BZR repository. If this could be done ASAP; that would be good.

==== Notes ====
[1]Major new issue for inclusion into Universe. Soma needs OpenSSL, but even though Soma has the licence exception, the other software does not. 

Rexbron, in luisbg's absence has packaged soma (including libsoma2) get binaries from www.aehunter.net and source from revu. The packages are not final (the source is) but should be able to satisfy build deps for the other packages. 
'''NOTE:''' in this release, pysoma and phpsoma may not be included due to problems packaging them. Email AndrewHunter if you REALLY need them and I will see if we can work something out.

The project is being rewritten from scratch for next upstream release, will reconsider for inclusion then. http://www.jahshaka.org/forum/showthread.php?t=1140&page=3&highlight=ubuntu (AndrewHunter)
