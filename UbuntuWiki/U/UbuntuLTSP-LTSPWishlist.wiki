This page will eventually become the Ubuntu LTSP wishlist page. Please add to it as much as you can, if you want to clean up, please do!

=== Wish List ===

1. More efficient disk caching on NFS server.

Explanation: Currently, when thin clients boot, the hard disk seems to be hit real hard (sorry, don't have hard information on seeks, etc yet). It would be great if the server would keep files that are read over NFS in memory for a short while, so that other clients that boot won't hit the hard disk so hard, and also improve boot speed when multiple clients boot at the same time.
