=== Summary ===

Locking a screen, logging out, sleeping, hibernating and shutting down represent a large and confusing array of options that could potentially be replaced by implementing a smart screen lock feature.

This feature depends on having a single consistent login screen to implement. See: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+spec/consistent-login-screen
