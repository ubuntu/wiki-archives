==== Call for testing: the new apt stable release update for 21.10/22.04 ====

Julian Andres Klode informs us of a new apt release for Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and Ubuntu 21.10 which should fix the "nasty cases where packages are uninstallable due to phased updates". We are provided the bug link, and asked to consider upgrading to the version in proposed and test it during the seven day testing period to reduce regression risk. Any problems found should be reported on this thread, on the bug report, or send via DM.

=== In the Press ===

==== China rallies support for Kylin Linux in war on Windows ====

Tobias Mann reminds us about what Kylin is; that it was started as a response to the government mandate to move away from Microsoft Windows. Kylin’s development included the switch from FreeBSD kernel to Linux and the subsequent Ubuntu based distribution; a survivor above other abandoned projects. We are told of the openKylin project, the recent joining of industry partners, and what this should mean for the future (particularly with regards RISC-V).

==== How a botched kernel patch broke Ubuntu – and why it may happen again ====

Tobias Mann describes a recent Ubuntu-specific kernel patch that caused problems for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS users using Docker and the HWE kernel stack. The Ubuntu images that use this HWE kernel stack are provided, and we're told the issue caused a kernel panic, which for some users could result in a 'boot loop'. We are given some details of the problem, and told it was fixed in a few days, with links for more details.

=== In the Blogosphere ===

==== Ubuntu's Chromium Snap Finally Seeing Progress On Supporting VA-API GPU Acceleration ====

Michael Larabel tells us that users of Ubuntu's Chromium Snap have been running "without VA-API support for GPU-based video acceleration", but that should soon change, allowing many users to also improve power efficiency. With a link to the bug report, we are told the issue may soon be history, with Canonical's Nathan Teodosio and Sebastien Bacher and other developers working on it. With some technical details on issues being encountered, we are also given a link so we can give it a try.

We are reminded the first Tuxedo Pulse 15 was introduced two years ago and given some original specs, and some of the improved specs of this newer device. Along with some prices (EUR & USD) and some pictures we are told they come with various OSes pre-installed which include: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, Kubuntu 22.04 LTS, or Ubuntu Budgie 22.04 LTS.

==== Star Labs Tease StarFighter, a Linux Laptop with 4K Display ====

Joey Sneddon asks if we're after a "large Linux-powered boasting a 4K display", this may have us covered. We are told of the UK-based company's Star``Fighter laptop, given some details of what we'll find within it, with links provided. We are told the prices are not yet known, and that pictures show elementary OS 6.1, but, we are told to expect Ubuntu 22.04 LTS to be offered pre-installed too.

==== KDE Gear 22.04.3 Brings More Bug Fixes to Kdenlive, Konsole, and Other Apps ====

Marius Nestor reports the KDE Project has released KDE Gear 22.04.3 containing many KDE software suite fixes. We are told it includes an improved Kdenlive video editor, improved Konsole terminal emulator, Elisa music player, and more. Marius details some of the fixes we'll find in each included app in this release. We are reminded this is the last maintenance update for KDE Gear 22.04, with the replacement KDE Gear 22.08 due for release on 18 August 2022.

==== Ubuntu Achieves A ~50% Reduction In Start Time For Firefox Snap ====

Michael Larabel writes that Canonical engineers have continued with their "quest to improve the start-up for the Snap version of Mozilla Firefox" with the latest improvements reducing the start-time by around "50%". We are told much of this improvement is due to "a Mozilla change to copy only one locale / language pack" instead of all. Other improvements have been accomplished by switching GNOME and GTK theme snaps over the LZO from XZ compression. Work is continuing though and we are told "multi-threaded decompression" is next with other items being explored too.

==== China retires last Windows desktops for homegrown Linux distro ====

Dashveenjit Kaur tells us that back in February 2020, "the Chinese government" "announced that it will be replacing all PCS that run Windows by the end of this year". Some statistics are provided, and we are told there are many replacement OSes, including Kylin Linux, and a "Ubuntu-based version of the OS" "introduced after Canonical reached an agreement with Chinese authorities". With mention of some of the companies garnering support for the project, we are also told of the Git``Hub alternative Gitee, along with a note that Windows "still holds a majority share" in the Chinese market.
