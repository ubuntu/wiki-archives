==== Call for testing: ubuntu-frame, mir-test-tools, mir-kiosk, egmde (Mir 2.13.0 update) ====

Alan Griffiths reports a list of snaps (with versions) that have been updated to the latest Mir release (2.13.0). These include mir-kiosk, egmde, mir-test-tools, and ubuntu-frame. Discussion then moves to mir-test-tools and ubuntu-frame being available for both 20 (core20) and 22 (core22) tracks. We are told the 22 track is still being set up, thus the 20 track is recommended. We are given a command to switch to the candidate channel for testing purposes, with a note that if no problems are reported the new versions will be promoted to stable in a week.
