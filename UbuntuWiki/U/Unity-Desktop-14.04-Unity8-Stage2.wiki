This specification describes the next stage of providing a Unity8 preview session on the desktop, after the first stage of being able to log in and run Touch applications from a Unity 8 shell on the desktop.

=== Rationale ===

A Unity8 desktop preview session is a requirement for enabling work on Unity8 as a cross-form-factor convergent OS shell.  It is not intended as a production desktop session but as a stepping stone to the final single converged system.
