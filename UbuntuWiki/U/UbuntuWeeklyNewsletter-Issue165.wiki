==== Release Candidate for Ubuntu 9.10 now available ====

The Ubuntu team is pleased to announce the Release Candidate for Ubuntu 9.10 Desktop and Server editions, Ubuntu 9.10 Server for UEC and EC2, and the Ubuntu Netbook Remix.  Codenamed "Karmic Koala", 9.10 continues Ubuntu's proud tradition of integrating the latest and greatest open source technologies into a high-quality, easy-to-use Linux distribution. We consider this release candidate to be complete, stable, and suitable for testing by any user.

Ubuntu 9.10 Desktop Edition improves on the work of 9.04 to get you going faster, with improved startup times and a streamlined boot experience.

Ubuntu 9.10 Server Edition integrates Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud setup in the installer and provides improvements to system security with App``Armor, including an App``Armor profile for libvirtd to further isolate virtual machines from the host system.

Ubuntu 9.10 Server for UEC and EC2 brings the power and stability of the Ubuntu Server Edition to cloud computing, whether you're using Amazon EC2 or your own Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud.

The Ubuntu 9.10 family of variants, Kubuntu, Xubuntu, Edubuntu, Ubuntu Studio, and Mythbuntu, also reach RC status today. This release sees the first technology preview of Kubuntu Netbook.

The final release of Ubuntu 9.10 is scheduled for 29 October 2009 and will be supported for 18 months on both desktops and servers. Users requiring a longer support lifetime on the server may choose to continue using Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, with security support until 2013, rather than upgrade to 9.10.

Before installing or upgrading to Ubuntu 9.10 please review the instructions and caveats in the release notes: http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes/910

In addition, there are a small number of known bugs in the release candidate that will be fixed before the Ubuntu 9.10 release, but warrant highlighting for your attention: http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes/910overview#Known%20issues

The purpose of the Release Candidate is to solicit one last round of testing before the final release. Here are ways that you can help:

* Upgrade from Ubuntu 9.04 to the Release Candidate by following the
   instructions in the release notes referenced above.

* Participate in installation testing using the Release Candidate CD
   images, by following the testing and reporting instructions at
   http://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/ISO

==== Ubuntu IRC Council Elections ====

Soon several members of the IRC Council (Joseph Price, Marek Spruell and Melissa Draper) will finish their terms of 2 years. The purpose of this email is to begin the process of electing new/re-electing members to the council.

Currently, the wiki states the following regarding IRC Council members:

* Be appointed by the Ubuntu Community Council in consultation with the IRC Council, IRC operators, and active contributors to the IRC channels. Nominations would be open and public and would be considered and evaluated by the CC. Each candidate should prepare a wiki page summarizing their nomination and their contributions and including and referencing testimonials (e.g., something similar to what is prepared for Ubuntu membership). The CC commits to evaluating all nominations
on the following criteria, listed in order of importance:

** The nominees active status as an Ubuntu Member (essential)

** The nominees support from at least one active IRC Council member (essential)

** Opinions and testimonials (positive and negative) from current members of the IRC Council

** Opinions and testimonials from current IRC operators - Opinions and testimonials from Ubuntu Members, Ubunteros, and other active participants on IRC - Evidence of activity within IRC (quality, quantity and duration)

* Serve terms of two (2) years. IRC Council members could serve multiple or repeated terms. Weight will be given to proved contributors and reelection of consistently active members should be both easy and common. "

from: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/IrcTeam/IrcCouncil

We would like to invite Ubuntu members to nominate themselves if they wish to run for election for the Ubuntu IRC Council. Please only nominate yourself, do not nominate others. If you are nominating yourself, please prepare a wiki page as described above. A nomination should be in the form of an email to the Ubuntu IRC Council email address: irc-council at lists.ubuntu.com

All nominations will be passed onto the Ubuntu Community Council. Thank you for your time and we look forward to seeing your nominations.

==== Keeping Ubuntu CD's Available ====

One of the ways in which many people have been able to experience Ubuntu is via Canonical’s Ship``It program, which has shipped millions of CDs to new users. This has provided a valuable opportunity for new users to try Ubuntu and for our community teams to obtain CDs as part of their advocacy efforts.

Due to the sheer growth of Ubuntu, we are making a few changes to Ship``It which I wanted to ensure I share with you. For the details, I am going to turn the mic over to everyone’s favorite Canonical COO, Jane Silber who updated us on the Canonical blog:

* The Ship``It program has been at the core of the Ubuntu project since its inception. The goal was to make sure that there are no restrictions, as far as was possible, to people having access to Ubuntu. In the last five years we have shipped millions of CDs and seen Ubuntu’s popularity and reach grow in ways that would be impossible without Ship``It. https://shipit.ubuntu.com/

  And that aim continues. We need to make Ubuntu available to as many people who need it, particularly those for whom the download options are limited. The goal has not been to supply a CD to every Ubuntu user of every version of Ubuntu. Remember, one of the coolest things about Ubuntu is the way you can upgrade from one version of Ubuntu to another – without the need for a CD!

  While these CDs are often referred to as “free CDs”, they are of course not free of cost to Canonical. We want to continue this programme, but Ubuntu’s growth means that some changes are necessary. Therefore we are adjusting how we handle CD requests to try to find the right balance between availability of CDs and the continued viability of the Ship``It programme.

 We will continue to supply CDs to Lo``Co teams and Ubuntu members. And we hope to make CDs available to everyone who is just discovering Ubuntu. And we continue to search for additional ways to make Ubuntu and Ubuntu materials available to everyone. But we are limiting shipments to people that we think have alternative paths of getting Ubuntu. For instance,

** you can upgrade to the new release without a CD: http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/upgrading
** you can download your own CD for free: http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download
** you will be able to download the CD wallet artwork: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DIYMarketing/#CD%20Distribution%20Materials
** becoming an Ubuntu member by contributing to Ubuntu, and thereby becoming eligible for more CDs: http://www.ubuntu.com/community/processes/newmember
** And finally, you can purchase CDs: http://shop.canonical.com/

    We will change the language on the Ship``It site to make it clearer what we are doing. We hope that you support this effort and realise that the intent is to continue to make Ubuntu available on CD to everyone who needs it.

Jane Silber, Canonical

==== Austin's Karmic Release Party ====

Join the team in Austin between 6pm - 9pm on Thursday, October 29, 2009 at Aussie's Grill and Beach Bar, at 306 Barton Springs Road, just east of the corner of Riverside and Barton Springs Road, south of the river. I figured an Australian-themed bar would have to work, in honor of the home of our lovely mascot, the Karmic Koala!

Burning CD's is so '90s... If you'd like a bootable/installable copy of Ubuntu 9.10 Karmic Koala, bring an empty USB stick, 1GB or bigger, and we'll gladly burn an image for you. There should be a couple of laptops demoing the new release. I'm planning on bringing two, to demo the Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud (UEC), powered by Eucalyptus, which I've been working on for the last few months.

=== Launchpad News ===

==== Launchpad: The next six months ====

A couple of weeks ago, the Launchpad team leads at Canonical gathered in Millbank Tower to talk about what we’ll be doing over the next six months. We talked with each other, we talked with Martin Pool from Bazaar, we talked with people on the Ubuntu Platform team, we talked with Mark Shuttleworth, we talked a lot.

Over the week, two very important things slowly began to dawn on us. I’ll talk about one of them now, and leave the other one to hang tantalizingly in the air like some forbidden fruit that’s learned how to hover.

The first important thing we realized is that Launchpad was originally conceived as a way of helping better connect the Ubuntu operating system to the upstream projects on which it depends. We further realized that could do that much better than we are right now.

A flood of bugs:

Zillions of bugs get filed against Ubuntu every day. While some of them are introduced when the Ubuntu community packages software, many are really bugs in the underlying upstream code.[citation needed] And quite often they’re already fixed in the latest upstream version — it’s just that the Ubuntu package doesn’t have the fix yet.

Yet even though Ubuntu is drowning in this sea of bugs, it can’t simply forward them upstream indiscriminately. Upstreams shouldn’t be bothered with old bugs; they only want to hear about bugs that are still in their code. And Ubuntu needs to know when such a bug has been found, both to tell users that a fix is coming and to help plan packaging updates.

Package of the day:

Launchpad should be doing much more to help rescue Ubuntu from this deluge. With PPAs and source package branches, Launchpad ought to be able to make it really easy to create a packaged version of the tip of any upstream, to test against, and to file bugs and provide patches directly to that upstream. That is,
Launchpad needs to make Ubuntu Daily Builds rock.

That’s going to be our overall focus now. At the same time, we’re also aware that we need to spend time polishing what we already have. So, for this month and for UDS, we’re going to be focusing only on reducing technical debt, fixing OOPSes and cleaning up the UI.

Where to now:

The Canonical Launchpad team are going to be focused on “bridging the gap” between Ubuntu and its upstreams. We’ll focus on better, faster bug triage, on making it really easy to get upstream tip on the Ubuntu desktop and really tight translations integration between Ubuntu & its upstreams. Early next week, we’ll email out a high-level roadmap of where we want to go.

We are interested in getting real-user feedback about our solution to better integrating upstreams and Ubuntu developers. If you are an upstream or Ubuntu developer interested by that problem, please contact us.

PS. If you’ve read this far, you are probably wondering what the second Very Important Thing was. I’m afraid you’ll just have to wait.

==== Meet Matthew Revell ====

Julian Edwards has turned the tables on Launchpad's communications expert Matthew Revell by interviewing him. As you may well know, Matthew is the one usually asking the questions and letting the Ubuntu community know what is going on with Launchpad. This time however, we get a little look into what is going on in Matthew's life. Read the full interview at the link below.

==== Jono Bacon: Wild and Wicked Wolverhampton Weekend ====

I'm fly to England back to Wolverhampton for Lug``Radio Live 2009. I have been over in California now for over a year and it will be the first time I have got to see many of my friends since I moved. It will also be the final re-union of the Lug``Radio team for the last ever live show and last ever Lug``Radio Live. It is going to be a blast! Tomorrow I fly to England back to Wolverhampton for Lug``Radio Live 2009. I have been over in California now for over a year and it will be the first time I have got to see many of my friends since I moved. It will also be the final re-union of the Lug``Radio team for the last ever live show and last ever Lug``Radio Live. It is going to be a blast! http://www.lugradio.org/live/2009/

Although Lug``Radio Live is entirely sold out of tickets, there is going to be one hell of a party on the Friday night at The Hogshead, 186 Stafford Street, Wolverhampton, WV1 1NA from 7.30pm and also on the Saturday night at the The Connaught Hotel, 40-50 Tettenhall Rd, Wolverhampton, WV1 4SW from 8pm. On the Saturday there will be Karaoke. Oh yes. Everyone is welcome to both parties, and I would love to see you all there!

The fun doesn’t end there though, oh no! On the Sunday, the first ever Ogg``Camp is going to take place at The Connaught Hotel in Wolverhampton, and it is shaping up to be an incredible event. The organizers behind it, the venerable Ubuntu UK and Linux Outlaws podcasts, have worked hard to make it a rocking event and I can’t wait for it! I really hope it becomes a staple in the UK Open Source event calendar. So, good people, get your delicate arses over to Ogg``Camp too.

What a rollicking weekend of Open Source goodness, firmly seated in the great British heartlands:

* Friday 23rd October – Party at The Hogs Head in Wolverhampton.
* Saturday 24th October – Lug``Radio Live 2009 and party at The Connaught Hotel in Wolverhampton.
* Sunday 25th October – Ogg``Camp at The Connaught Hotel in Wolverhampton.

==== Dustin Kirkland: Linux Magazine: Ubuntu Encrypted Home ====

Back in April, Linux Magazine ran what I considered to be an inaccurate account of the OS-level security provided by our Ubuntu Distribution. Your Distro is Insecure: Ubuntu. http://www.linux-mag.com/id/7297/1

Frustrated with the piece, I blogged this in return: Your Article is Incorrect: Linux Magazine. http://blog.dustinkirkland.com/2009/04/your-article-is-incorrect.html

Following that post, I had a very constructive, private email conversation with Linux Magazine editor, Bryan Richard. We discussed a number of different ways that Canonical/Ubuntu might be able to respond to their previous article, which caused quite a stir on Ubuntu's public mailing lists.

I'm very pleased with Bryan's response. He invited me to author an article focusing on the security features that are available in Ubuntu. The result was published earlier today, focusing on Ubuntu's Encrypted Home Directory feature, which is rather unique among Linux distributions: Ubuntu's Encrypted Home Directory: A Canonical Approach to Data Privacy http://www.linux-mag.com/cache/7568/1.html

==== Canonical Takes on Win 7 With Ubuntu 9.10 RC ====

Canonical on Thursday made available the Release Candidate of its latest Linux-based operating system, Ubuntu 9.10, on the same day Microsoft launched the long-awaited Windows 7. The upcoming Canonical release, which is code-named Karmic Koala, is the latest version of the popular flavor of the Linux OS. The development release on Thursday pushed the OS one step closer to final release, which is due on Oct. 29, according to the company's release schedule Web page. Built on the latest Linux 2.6.31.1 kernel, Ubuntu 9.10 offers faster boot times, an improved user interface and programming tools for easier software development, according to Canonical.

Earlier development of Ubuntu 9.10 releases -- including the most recent beta edition -- have received mixed reviews on the Web. Some complained of applications not working, while other disagreed with user interface changes. But some were thrilled by the OS improvements: "What I have is a remarkably fast and powerful machine built using some inexpensive software and hardware," wrote a poster going by the name of Liberty in response to a blog entry. Using a test release of Karmic Koala, the poster said setting up an Internet connection on an Intel dual-core Atom system was a breeze. Networking an all-in-one printer was a "piece of cake," Liberty wrote.

http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/174190/canonical_takes_on_win_7_with_ubuntu_910_rc.html

==== Review: Ubuntu 9.10 Brings Good Karma To Linux ====

Canonical has some lofty ambitions for Ubuntu 9.10, code-named "Karmic Koala." The latest Ubuntu edition will offer integration with cloud computing and netbooks. One of Canonical's goals is to make it easier to deploy applications in the cloud, using Amazon (NSDQ: AMZN)'s EC2 platform. Canonical's also trying to break the 25-second goal for booting up Jaunty (Ubuntu 9.04) on netbooks. Ubuntu 9.10 continues version 9.04's ease of install and operation, and is jam-packed with useful, free applications. The ability to run Ubuntu within Windows is an added plus for users who may still want to "feel out" a Linux desktop OS before giving up Windows.

Significant changes from Ubuntu 9.04 to 9.10 beta aren't strictly cosmetic ones. Want to add software to Ubuntu 9.10? This release replaces the Add/Remove feature in the Applications menu with the more contemporary Ubuntu Software Center. Ubuntu 9.10 also replaces the Pidgin IM client with the feature-rich Empathy client. This is part of the updated GNOME 2.28 desktop environment. Canonical seems to be at the forefront of demystifying Linux for the "rest of us." Add into the mix a fleshing out of Ubuntu's server offering and extendibility into the cloud and you have a stronger case for Linux in the corporate environment other than "It's free."

==== Ubuntu Linux Server Simplifies the Cloud ====

With new Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud (EUC) capabilities and tools now fully integrated into its upcoming Ubuntu 9.10 Server Edition operating system, Linux vendor Ubuntu is getting ready to spread the benefits and promise of cloud computing to corporate users, VARs and resellers. For customers, VARs and resellers, that means that users and system integrators will be able to have an easier time creating, deploying and managing private, behind-the-firewall clouds for users who want to explore its options and possibilities. A key to Ubuntu's new OS is that by providing the tools to build fully-featured private clouds for users, it could help encourage their spread by many businesses that are currently prevented from using public clouds today due to security and regulatory issues surrounding their critical data.

Steve George, director of corporate services for London-based Canonical, said the new version of Ubuntu's server operating system also marks a new channel focus for the companies. "The open source community and open source businesses have not traditionally focused a lot on the channel and reaching out," George said. "At Canonical, when we think about how we reach out to customers, we think of working with the channel or partner companies as being a key aspect. There's a very straightforward reason for that. Canonical is essentially an engineering company, so for us to reach out to customers on the strength of our own people just isn’t possible."

==== 5 years later, 5 ways that Ubuntu has made Linux more human ====

ARS Technica's Ryan Paul looks back to when Canonical announced the very first release of the Ubuntu Linux distribution on October 20, 2004. Five years later, Ubuntu is the star of the Linux desktop and has achieved a level of popularity and mindshare that is unprecedented among the various flavors of the open source operating system. Ubuntu has come a long way over the past five years but still has a long road ahead before the infamous Bug #1 can be closed. The upcoming release of Ubuntu 9.10, scheduled for next week, is another important step forward. http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2009/10/5-years-later-5-ways-that-ubuntu-has-made-linux-more-human.ars?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss

==== Happy Birthday, Ubuntu! ====
Marius Nestor of Softpedia thinks that with only a few days until Karmic Koala's official release, it's time to take a look into the past. Five years ago, on the 20th of October, 2004, Mark Shuttleworth and the "warm-hearted Warthogs" from the developer team announced the first official Ubuntu release. Version 4.10, code name "Warty Warthog," was only the first representative in a line of operating systems that were made by human beings for human beings, aiming to let normal people use Linux. Happy Birthday Ubuntu! http://news.softpedia.com/news/Happy-Birthday-Ubuntu-124827.shtml

==== Ubuntu Linux powers up ====

Mark Kellner of the Washington Times wonders just how important are computer operating systems, anyway? This past Thursday morning Microsoft launched Windows 7, and in late August Apple launched Snow Leopard. Are there any alternatives to them? Quite possibly, and its name is Linux — specifically, Ubuntu Linux. Version 9.10 is expected to debut Oct. 29. The nice thing about Ubuntu is that it really is free: Just download a disc image of Ubuntu, burn it a CD or DVD, and you're ready to install it on a computer near you. For straight business applications, Ubuntu as an operating environment is more than adequate. You can't beat the price, especially in these cost-conscious days. http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/oct/19/kellner-ubuntu-linux-powers-up/

==== Ubuntu 9.10 Release Candidate Has Arrived ====

Phoronix's Michael Larabel tells us that with one week to go until the official release of Ubuntu 9.10 "Karmic Koala", Canonical has announced the release candidate of this forthcoming Linux distribution update. Kubuntu, Xubuntu, Edubuntu, Ubuntu Studio, and Mythbuntu have all reached Ubuntu 9.10 RC status as well. There are many improvements to Ubuntu 9.10 and others in the Ubuntu family like Kubuntu and Mythbuntu too, which is briefly described in the Ubuntu 9.10 RC release announcement. The final release of Ubuntu 9.10 is expected on the 29th of October. Succeeding Ubuntu 9.10 will be Ubuntu 10.04 LTS next year, which is codenamed the Lucid Lynx. http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=NzYyNw

==== What's New In Ubuntu 9.10 "Karmic Koala" ====

Christer Edwards of Packt Publishing notes that Ubuntu 9.10 will be out soon, and users around the world are hard at work testing and submitting fixes, eagerly trying to patch every hole in time for the final release. Ubuntu 9.10 "Karmic Koala" continues Ubuntu's tradition of six-month releases, each offering new features and improvements on the release before it. Ubuntu truly is a force to be reckoned with when it comes to pushing the envelope, yet at the same time stabilizing and improving the overall experience. http://www.packtpub.com/article/what-is-new-in-ubuntu-9.10-karmic-koala

==== Ubuntu 9.10 Netbook Performance ====

Michael Larabel of Phoronix asks if it is worth the upgrading to Ubuntu 9.10 if you are running a netbook? From his testing of the development releases, it is most certainly worth the upgrade, especially when compared to Ubuntu 9.04 with its buggy Intel driver stack that caused many problems for Atom netbook users. Ubuntu 9.10 brings many usability improvements to the Linux desktop, various new packages, and the overall system performance has improved too. He has ran a set of benchmarks on both a Dell Inspiron Mini 9 and Samsung NC10 under Ubuntu 9.04 and 9.10 to illustrate the performance gains along with a few regressions. Overall, Ubuntu 9.10 provides some nice performance boosts to netbook users. http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=ubuntu_karmic_netbook&num=1

==== Ubuntu’s Encrypted Home Directory: A Canonical Approach to Data Privacy ====

Linux Magazine's Dustin Kirkland says that a friend recently quizzed him about the Encrypted Home Directory feature in Ubuntu, but unfortunately his questions were not due simply to his naturally inquisitive nature. A week earlier, his friend was en route to a Free Software conference and boarding a train in Europe after an overnight flight from the United States. In a flash, one thief created a diversion while the theif's partner-in-crime stole his friend’s laptop case. While Kirkland's friend was not particularly happy about losing his computer, he was far more distraught at his potentially compromised data which included encryption keys, stored website passwords, personal finance information, confidential documents… everything. By Ubuntu's adding a suite of user space utilities, support in the Ubuntu installer and integration with system authentication, e``Cryptfs provides an elegant home directory encryption scheme while continuing to deliver an outstanding user experience. http://www.linux-mag.com/cache/7568/1.html

==== A Guided Tour Of Ubuntu 9.10 Karmic Koala ====

It's set to be the biggest and best release of Ubuntu so far and it impresses right from the get-go with an impressive installer, fast boot times, new artwork and a whole lot more. This blogger not only lists most of the changes in Karmic, he includes lots of screenshots. In conclusion, he notes that this is only the beginning and that his overview only scratches the surface of all the improvements, refinements and changes in Ubuntu 9.10.

==== Ubuntu 9.10 Review; even better than before ====

With the latest version, Ubuntu will give you integration with cloud computing and net-books. The ability to deploy applications in the cloud much easier than before is one of Canonical’s goal for 9.10 using Amazon’s EC2 platform. Canonical is also trying to beat the 25-second booting time when usingUbuntu 9.04 on net-books. Ubuntu comes loaded with a lot of valuable software and system tools. With the release of Ubuntu 9.10 , Canonical is certainly bringing Linux more closer to the “normal user” and coupled with the fact that it is FREE, I see no reason in not wanting to test it.

==== GNU/Linux Security: Ubuntu has been Cracked! ====

Gene, with ERACC,  talks security issues that can effect the GNU/Linux User.  Comparing the vulnerabilities in Windows v. GNU LInux and where those points of weakness may or may not be.  Gene touches on the "ignorant user problem",  as well as those who are "apathetic about security".  In this article Gene encourages how we can address these issues and encourage the GNU/Linux user to be proactive in security processes. http://blog.eracc.com/2009/10/18/gnulinux-security-ubuntu-has-been-cracked/

==== IBM and Ubuntu roll Linux for U.S desktops vs Windows 7 ====

Sean Michael Kerner, internetnew.com, pulls from the 'First in Africa, now in the U.S' files and talks about the IBM and Ubuntu "launch of Linux and cloud-based desktop software in the U.S." This effort combines a Linux OS and IBM smart client applications known as Open Collaboration Client Software . In their press releases IBM and Canonical (commercial sponsors of Ubuntu) discuss the expensive of migrating to Windows 7 and together they offer a viable solution to businesses that cannot or will not update their hardware to run Windows 7. This joint solution announced on the heels of the Windows 7 roll out gives business an alternative that negates the cost of expensive. http://blog.internetnews.com/skerner/2009/10/ibm-and-ubuntu-roll-linux-for.html

==== NetworkManager Gets Facelift for Karmic Koala Ubuntu 9.10 ====

Christopher Tozzi, WorkswithU, discusses the new look of Karmic's Network Manager.  He points out that Free Soft can look as good if not better than that of the proprietary operating systems.  He carefully points out some of the short comings in this new NM in Karmic vs. Jaunty but readily admits he hasn't used it long enough yet to "say anything with certainty" to the technical aspects of and if the past failings of NM were fixed in this latest release.  Take a look at the full post and the screen shots and links that Tozzi has given you, and see what you think of the new Network Manager. http://www.workswithu.com/2009/10/19/networkmanager-gets-facelift-for-karmic/
