__TOC__

Ubuntu Studio hereby proposes a 3 year period for the LTS release of Ubuntu Studio 14.04 Trusty Tahr.

== Support ==

Support will mainly be in the form of bug fixing and backporting of packages in the Ubuntu Studio package set.

== Point Releases ==

Ubuntu Studio will participate in all point releases as defined for Ubuntu for the first three years - following the 3 year LTS support period of Xubuntu, which Ubuntu Studio bases its desktop on.

== Kernel support ==

linux-lowlatency is now merged into the Canonical master tree, and only diffs in a few kernel configs compared to linux-generic. The Ubuntu Studio kernel team continues to maintain the config diff and fixes linux-lowlatency specific bugs for this kernel, in collaboration with the Canonical kernel team.
