=== Viewing a Session ===

Summit provides a Session page that embeds the !YouTube broadcast video, the Etherpad document, and a Web Chat widget configured for the correct IRC channel.  A small javascript process will periodically check for the availability of the !YouTube broadcast URL and automatically update the page so that users do not need to refresh.

If the user is one of the “required” participants, as designated by the Track Lead or Session Drafter, will additionally be presented with a link to join the On-Air Hangout.  Additional participants can join the On-Air Hangout if given the Hangout URL by somebody already there.
