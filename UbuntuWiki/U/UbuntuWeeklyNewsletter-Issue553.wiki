==== Mir News: 9th of November 2018 ====

Alan Griffiths (alan_g) reports of the continuing works on  porting the MATE panel to Wayland and the Nvidia driver support. Unfortunately still not ready for prime time for release to Mir 1.1.  Alan is excited to advise of an alternate to mir-kiosk in a new desktop snap that yields a more realistic “desktop” confinement, and that the portability of egmde desktop snap is improved and now supports other Ubuntu series as well as possibly other distributions.
