==== Major update of Ubuntu Brainstorm: Call for testing ====

A major evolution of Ubuntu Brainstorm is on the way, it includes:

* An UI redesign, for better navigation through projects and categories.
* Idea rationale & solution separation, with the ability to add your solution to an existing idea rationale. This will help visibility by gathering ideas together that are working on the same problem.
* Approval required for newly submitted ideas. This will help make Ubuntu Brainstorm content consistent by filtering the non-ideas, duplicates and poorly described ideas.
* Custom permissions for project administrators. Upstream and Ubuntu developers could, if they want, ask to add their project and manage ideas related to their project.
* And much more...

A lot of changes have occurred, and Brainstorm would like to test these changes thoroughly before going live, which we don't expect to do for at least a month. You are welcome to post test content, vote, and report any error you find on https://bugs.launchpad.net/ideatorrent/+filebug. Discussions and suggestions about the new UI can take place at ubuntuforums.org thread. (Note: This is a test setup, meaning that all your interactions will be removed at next code update)

==== Ubuntu Arabic Team ====

The Ubuntu Arabic team has been quietly working to merge all of the scattered Ubuntu related efforts in Arabia to establish one solid team and it looks like things are about to break open. They have merged with ubuntu-alarabi.net and now waiting to hear from arabuntu.org.

The goals for this team are:

*** Handling Arabic Support on discussion forum, mailing list IRC and LP answers.
*** Provide hosting to Ubuntu Lo``Co Teams in Arabia and give them any help possible
*** Translating available contributor guides to Arabic to get the more contributor from Arabia (Now we are working on new translators guide) next might be MOTU
*** Taking Arabic translation into higher level, currently we have 165 translator, 266742 untranslated strings which make the status %64 untranslated.
*** Providing Arab users with apps that doesn’t exists yet in official repositories in our PPA

The team is still growing, and of course needs some help. If you are interested in contributing, please visit the link for more information on what you can do to help. http://syntux.net/blog/2008/08/21/ubuntu-arabic-team/

==== New Xubuntu Developer: Michael Casadevall ====

The Xubuntu Team would like everyone to give a warm welcome to Michael Casadevall
who is joining the Xubuntu Team as a Xubuntu Developer. Michael is an exceptionally dedicated individual with a strong, diversified pool of talent and skill who is eagerly working towards becoming a MOTU. Michael will be assisting the team with general packaging and development tasks for the most part, but the  team is sure his ability with FTBFS; experience with ports, debian, and gnome; and his ability to identify and refine infrastructure will be a huge asset to the Xubuntu team.

=== In The Press ===

* Is Ubuntu Really the Most User Friendly Distribution? - Bruce Byfield gives us his analysis of the idea of "Most User Friendly Distribution" from several angles.  Along the way, he explores the fact that, for most users, it's the desktop experience that determines "friendly". In other examples, he explores the mirroring of ideas and changes between distributions and the fact that many improvements are to individual packages, such as Gnome and KDE, rather than the distribution itself. Over all, he is impressed with Ubuntu's ability to support traditional community values and the realities of commercialization. http://itmanagement.earthweb.com/osrc/article.php/3766771/Is+Ubuntu+Really+the+Most+User+Friendly+Distribution?.htm

* Two Operating Systems, One PC  - J. D. Biersdorfer, reporting for '''The New York Times''', answers the question of how to install Ubuntu Linux on a Windows XP computer without having to reinstall XP. His brief tutorial does give links to where to get Ubuntu 8.04, and to information on Wubi and tutorials on installation. He also makes the appropriate comment about backing up one's data prior to repartitioning and installing. Note: If you visit the link, registration is required, but it is free to all. http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/21/technology/personaltech/21askk-002.html?_r=1&ref=personaltech&oref=slogin

=== In The Blogosphere ===

* Why It’s Okay for Oracle, SAP to Skip Ubuntu (for Now) – Joe Panettieri of the blog workswithu.com points out that the concern for SAP and Oracle’s lack of endorsement of Canonical and Ubuntu is unfounded. He comments that Dell is Oracles’ biggest reseller, and that currently most of Dell’s Oracle server sales involve either Red Hat or Windows Server. Based on the fact that Dell has no imminent plan to move to Ubuntu server it makes sense that Oracle would follow Dell’s lead. Additionally, Linux is a currently a niche market for SAP, but as demand for Ubuntu in the server market increases, then Oracle and SAP will be compelled to join with Canonical. http://www.workswithu.com/2008/08/14/why-its-okay-for-oracle-sap-to-skip-ubuntu-for-now/

* 5 Reasons Why a Newbie Should Try Ubuntu – A decade ago Linux was typically for geeks…Ubuntu is starting to change that perception. Praval of the blog Brajeshwar.com outlines five reasons that Ubuntu is the Linux distribution for the rest of us.  Cited are Ubuntu’s ability to test drive before you commit to reconfiguring your hard drive through the use of LiveCD, easy installation and setup, wide range of supported devices, the ability to upgrade with the click of a mouse, and phenomenal community support.  Many who would have never considered trying Linux have installed Ubuntu, and based on their initial experiences, many remain avid Ubuntu users. http://brajeshwar.com/2008/newbie-should-try-ubuntu/

* Ubuntu and the coolness - Blogger everdeath revisits Ubuntu and decides to replace Windows with it. This blogger is surprised at how much Ubuntu has changed, including the ability to read and write NTFS, and speed enhancements for playing games through wine. Windows is gone for good for this user, but he is reluctant to switch their Mac away from OSX which helps prove Mark Shuttleworth's recent comments that Linux's main competition now is the Mac. http://everdeath.livejournal.com/62540.html

* Dell/Ubuntu Inspiron 1525 review - Blogger Mark Schoonover recently decided to purchase a Dell Inspiron 1525N running Ubuntu. He was up and running off this new system within 30 minutes of opening the box, and so far his wireless is more reliable than previous systems, the DVD writer works well, and the keyboard has a nice feel to it. His overall impression is that this is a fantastic laptop for less than $750. He feels that Dell laptops running Ubuntu are a great combination. http://marksitblog.blogspot.com/2008/08/dellubuntu-inspiron-1525-review.html

=== Editorial Comment ===

==== Happy Birthday Linux ====

On August 25, 1991, an unknown student in Helsinki, Finland, posted a question to the comp.os.minix newsgroup.  In 3 days, there were 7 replies, including some of his own further explaining what he had done and what he wanted to do.  Now, 17 years later, there are numerous distributions (including Ubuntu) that operate on the kernel that Linus Torvalds first conceived as a personal project.  Happy Birthday, Linux, and thank you Linus for your inspiration and dedication to good computing.  For the original messages that started this all off, see http://groups.google.com/group/comp.os.minix/browse_thread/thread/76536d1fb451ac60/b813d52cbc5a044b

=== Meeting Summaries ===

==== MOTU Council Meeting, Aug 20th 2008 ====

* Open Applications: Dustin Kirkland (MOTU), Fabien Tassin (MOTU), Iain Lane (UUC)
* MOTU Council voting procedures
** Due to confusions with recent application processing, MC will be adopting the following interim changes to the application processing procedure.  It is expected that more discussion on this topic will happen in the future.
** There will be a new 168-hour window for MOTU discussion, which may be closed early if all listed sponsors for an application have responded.
** At the conclusion of this period, MOTU Council members will be expected to vote, although discussion may continue until all Council members have either voted or stated their intention not to vote.  Only once all feedback from MOTU Council has been received will applications be processed as complete.
* Additional discussion mirroring mailing list discussions regarding applications for MOTU vs. applications for Core-Dev, and the various requirements that ought be applied in either case.  This discussion was inconclusive, and will likely be taken up again, largely informed by the ongoing discussions on the mailing list.

==== Ubuntu Women ====

* IRC Meeting: 16 August 2008 http://wiki.ubuntu-women.org/Meetings/20080816

** Discussed confidence barrier with new contributors to the project, and one new member gave us some ideas about what made her feel most welcome
** Mentoring program by MOTU was brought up as something we should be linking to in our Mentoring program, got +1
