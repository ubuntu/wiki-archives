Its time for a free, all-day gathering to show each
other what *buntu can do, and we have just the time and place!

* '''When:''' Saturday 2007-06-02, probably 9-5
* '''Where:''' Google's Boulder office: 1433 Pearl
* '''What:''' An "unconference" like Barcamp: a spontaneous day of Ubuntu-related demos, talks, chats, etc

See <nowiki>[[Ubucon]]</nowiki> for other such gatherings.

=== What ===

We'll have a small conference room with wifi and LCD projector.  About 20
people can squeeze in.  The space will be tight, so sign up early.

The focus is to share cool Ubuntu stuff with each other.  Be prepared
to share how YOU do stuff with Ubuntu.  E.g. bring your laptops and
demo some application, or show how to participate in ubuntuland via
launchpad and the wiki, propose some projects and specs, set up an
Edubuntu thin client network, get hands-on help installing Ubuntu, or whatever.  But what you propose to
talk about should be possible with Ubuntu.  And that doesn't limit
things very much :-)  E.g. we'll probably spend some time helping Jim
out with https://wiki.edubuntu.org/TIEColorado

We'll announce it first for <nowiki>[[http://coloco.ubuntu-rocks.org/|Colorado LoCo team]]</nowiki> members, but we'll
invite anyone interested in Linux to sign up if there's space.

For a taste of similar gatherings, see
http://barcamp.org/BarCampBoulder . The general unconference process
is to show up with ideas, list them on a whiteboard at the beginning
of the day, and let people decide then and there what the agenda
should be and what they're interested in.  Besides the main "track" in
the conference room, folks can propose other things to talk about in
the anteroom or outside.

The <nowiki>[[BOFHowto]]</nowiki> is handy for any sessions that involve planning projects or developing blueprints for Ubuntu.

See <nowiki>[[/Schedule]]</nowiki> for a schedule of sessions.

=== Where ===
The Google office in Boulder is on the <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_Street_Mall|Pearl St Mall]]</nowiki>, next to
Starbucks, and has wifi and a small conference room.  Our biggest fear
is that it is too good a location and we'll have too many people :-)
But other attempts to quickly find a bigger place haven't panned out.

Naturally enough they don't want us wandering around the development
cubes....  I figure 20 can squeeze into the conference room, and
others can stand and watch.  And they also have a waiting area right
outside the conference room, and for spillover we can always go a few
steps outside into the beautiful ambiance of the mall.

Our very friendly host is Jim Mc``Master, a developer at Google.  And
our contact came thru Leslie Hawthorn, of Google's Open Source Program
Office in California.  She manages the Google Summer of Code program.
Everybody thank Jim and Leslie :-)

Google plans to move late this summer, so they may even have more
space for a later Gutsy release Ubucon, if we behave ourselves :-)
