Welcome to Ubuntu Developer Summit!
put your session notes here
=== Display ===
* X server 1.13 or 1.12 depending on when 1.13 lands, together with matching drivers
* Use a system compositor to provide fully flicker free boot and enable greeter improvements (on drivers that support it)
=== Unity ===
* Use greeter as lock screen
* Keep greeter showing while session loads
* llvmpipe and opengles support in Unity 3D -> dropping 2d if we can (a11y, llvmpipe performances)
* gsettings support to compiz
* extra features under discussion: unity dialogs, coverflow
* More tests and quality improvements
=== GNOME in 12.10 ===
* Update everything to 3.6
** This includes clutter, i. e. new totem, video calls in empathy by default, current games
* Remove all patches from GNOME Control Center unless they're upstreamed to GNOME git. Ubuntu will use ubuntu-control-center, which is the same as gnome-control-center just with the Ubuntu patches (like was used in 12.04 and before); and add a "real" gnome-control-center for the upstream experience
* Convert Ubuntu gsettings overrides to session overrides to only affect the Unity session and moving defaults to ubuntu-defaults
* An "Ubuntu GNOME" flavor, shipping GNOME apps with the default GNOME configurations
=== Firefox and Thunderbird ===
* normal regular updates
* overlay scrollbars
=== Accessibility ===
* improving unity 3D a11y, now that we are phasing out the fallback
* needs work on some GTK widgets
=== Sound ===
* Business as usual, no major changes planned
=== LibreOffice ===
* lo-menubar: looking good, there should be enough reserves to implement this
* drop current templates from main, add presenter-console, ogltransitions, pdf-import and presenattion-minimizer to seed for it in that order (should mostly sizeneutral -- size limit now 750MB? needs to be confirmed)
* upstream "template store" wont be ready for quantal, but some 6-10 good new templates will be: pack them to universe and add session-installer hooks in libreoffice for it
* add session installer hooks for everything missing from default install if possible
* add languagetool grammar checker to universe at least
* reenable report-builder
=== Networking ===
* Finish fixing IPv6 (even on mobile!)
* Add proxy support to NM
* Add firewall support to NM
=== Plumbing ===
* Remove complicated jockey logic, move to an upstream friendly PackageKit API, new and simpler design for third party drivers in the control-center
* Replace language-selector GUI with upstream control-center applet, and add missing input method configuration
 
=== QA ===
* Adding lots more autopkgtest integration to existing tests, to improve the automatic proposed->release migration
* Write more automatic test cases for suspend, multi-monitor, nautilus, gvfs, etc. (upstream)
* run LibreOffice builds and testsuites regularly
=== Other ===
* watch boot speed,  improve if we can, make sure we don't regress at least
* Start dealing better with configuration upgrade within session
* python3 porting of our desktop components (apport, software-properties, jockey, etc.)
* aim at dropping gconf and pygtk2 from the CD
