| independent Ubuntu software R&D
| make things simple by automating tasks in GUI, my mission is to design attractive HIG compliant GUI software for making life in linux easy. My vision is to make Linux a premier desktop OS choice along with MacOSX and Windows Vista. I made, UbuntuLiveChatSupport, UbuntuCommonHooker, UbuntuCommercialSupport, UbuntuHomeBackup, SensibleIRCHandler, UbuntuWelcomeCenter, and counting.... I'm also researching for ways to optimize GNOME, OpenOffice.org, etc, through different ways, currently I'm using XML optimizations. I install Hoary in 300 computers, and planning to install dapper for 1000 computers in AMA Computer University.
