==== Organizing Google Code-In 2018 ====

Ubuntu has been involved for many years, this year Canonical hopes to have Snappy activity, plus community activity, but are having trouble putting together enough tasks in time for the deadline - Monday, 17th September.

==== Please test chromium snap as a replacement for the deb ====

Olivier Tilloy (oSoMoN) calls for testing the Chromium Snap package, which is now being built directly from source rather than from the DEB package as previously. The stated goal is to replace the current DEB packaging with it. Olivier gives install instructions and links to report issues.

==== Mir News: 14th September 2018 ====

Alan Griffiths (alan_g) writes that the focus this week has been on testing mir-kiosk to improve “graphical snaps”, and documentation preparation. A few bugs have been found in the testing that delay the next release. Alan cites two bug fixes, updates on Snapcraft, gives a link to Mir development, updates on Nvidia driver support, and a status on X11 support.

In other areas Simon advises that Trojitá packaging continues, Calamares 3.2.2 is released, there is a new arrival in the Artwork Team, there is updated documentation with listed means to communicate and contribute.
