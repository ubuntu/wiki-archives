==== Ubuntu Women: The First Ubuntu Women Survey ====

Elizabeth Krumbach Joseph writes that at the last virtual Ubuntu Developer Summit, it was decided to conduct a survey of the community to learn what people expected from the Ubuntu Women project. She tells us that the anonymous survey is now online and that the results will be used to better determine how team members spend their time, what projects should be promoted, and what projects should receive focus.

==== Didier Roche: Release early, release often, release every 4h! ====

Didier Roche shares news about modifications to the daily release of changes to components of Ubuntu, writing: “I'm happy to announce that now, we are capable of releasing every 4h to distro! Time for a branch proposed to trunk to the distro is drastically reduced thanks to this. But we still took great care to keep the same safety net though with tests running, ABI handling, and not pushing every commit to distro.”

==== Benjamin Kerensa: Firefox To Remain Default…. Very Nice! ====

Benjamin Kerensa writes that Jason Warner, who leads the Ubuntu Desktop Team, has announced that Firefox will continue to be the default browser for Ubuntu 13.10. Benjamin says "I urge Mozillians in the Ubuntu Community to take part in the upcoming vUDS and share your opinion on what the default browser should be in Ubuntu 14.04" and adds that he thinks it is very important that Ubuntu continues to ship a browser which is backed by an organization like Mozilla which helps power the open web and champions user privacy.

==== Why Ubuntu's creator still invests his fortune in an unprofitable company ====

Jon Brodkin of Ars Technica begins with statistics around Ubuntu and Canonical related to the amount of money Mark Shuttleworth has invested over the past 10 years, writing that the company is still not profitable and today “he continues funding Canonical from his own fortune.” Brodkin continues discussing the new mobile strategy, quoting Shuttleworth’s “I think the desktop on its own will die” rationale for coupling Ubuntu with the mobile market. The article then explores various other methods Canonical has employed to become profitable and their competitors in this space.

==== Canonical On Why They Chose Indiegogo Over Kickstarter For The Ubuntu Edge ====

Charles Luzar of Crowdfund Insider covers the Ubuntu Edge kickstarter campaign in a different way by reaching out to Canonical to learn why they chose to use Indiegogo over Kickstarter. Luzar shares comments from Canonical’s Christine Tran who cites audience and focus as the reasons. “While Kickstarter has a track record of higher funding achieved for individual projects, Indiegogo was also attractive because of their wider international reach. Ultimately, Ubuntu Edge is all about technology. This is an area that fully aligns with Indiegogo strategic direction, while Kickstarter is focused on other topics. This was the main decider in favour of Indiegogo.”
