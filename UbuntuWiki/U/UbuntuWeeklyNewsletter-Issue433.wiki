==== That Awkward Ubuntu Tablet Plans To Go Up For Pre-Order Soon ====

Michael Larabel of Phoronix reports that MJ Technology, inspired by the failed Ubuntu Edge campaign, is to start accepting pre-orders for their unofficial Ubuntu tablet in January. Michael gives us some specifications of the device, shows us some screenshots, and raises his concern that the company has no proven track record, they haven’t even contacted Canonical. and that they’re aiming to use the desktop version of Ubuntu rather than the Phone/Touch version that’s designed for such form factors.

==== The Death of Ubuntu's Software Center ====

Matt Hartley of Datamation looks at the alternatives that some of the Ubuntu flavors and derivatives are using in preference to the Ubuntu Software Center. He puts forward the argument that a software store is not there for ease of installation but somewhere where reviews and feature lists can be read, and applications can be visually discovered. Matt also notes that the move away from Debian packaging will be slow as will the death of the Software Center.

==== Ubuntu Will Not Abandon DEB Packaging in Favor of Snappy, Says Mark Shuttleworth ====

Marius Nestor of Softpedia shares highlights from a recent interview by Sean Michael Kerner from Server``Watch of Mark Shuttleworth. In addition to talking about highlights of the 15.10 release, the video has the following quote from Mark Shuttleworth confirming that the DEB-based versions of Ubuntu will not be abandoned: "'We build Snappy out of the built debs, so we can't build Snappy unless we first build the deb,' said Mark Shuttleworth in the video interview. 'Going forward every six months, we're still gonna get an archive full of DEBs.'"
