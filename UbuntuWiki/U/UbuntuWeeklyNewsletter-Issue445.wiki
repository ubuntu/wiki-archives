In a post on the Ubuntu Studio website, the team advise that they are seeking a new Project Lead. They explain that the vote will occur between January and April 2016 and that candidates should have experience with software development and Debian packaging, and that audio production experience will be helpful. They go on to say that there will be a vote every two years, so that each new project lead will be responsible for the development of a single LTS release.
