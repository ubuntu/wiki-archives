== Summary ==

The UbuntuHomeBackup aims to provide an interface to easily create
backups of your files in any medium. It backup your settings, home directory or system files by a simple step-by-step interface that
guide you into the process.

== Rational ==

Ubuntu Linux is growing, and people would be using it for everyday use.
However, file loss and critical data corruption is likely to happen accidentally or by hardware or software faults. Mediums of data storage
keeps getting cheaper, and much easier to access, but currently, it is not yet used by backup tools.

== Scope ==

The backup tool will be able to use CD-R/RW Recordable Disc, USB Disk Drive, E-Mail, FTP Network Servers, Apple iPod, and Local Directory as a backup medium. Backups of the user's home directory files, settings, or system files like /home, /etc, and /var would be available in the interface.

== Design ==

=== Invocation and Overall Design ===

The software will be linked right into "System > Administration > Backup" menu. and will have a stock harddisk icon. A selection of what
files would be available for backup, and what storage medium would be used.

=== GUI file extraction ===

This would be available along with the backup files if disk medium is used as a backup storage. The user simply double click the application to easily extract the files to the directory.

== Code ==

The code is written in GTK+, C, sh and perl as a scripting backend.

== Source Package ==

<nowiki>[[attachment:ubuntu-home-backup-0.1.tar.gz]]</nowiki>

Version 0.1 "No one accepts my 5 cents and 10 cents anymore."

This is the first release of the software, but it's quite stable, FTP and GUI file extraction is still WIP. I really love feedbacks! :-) 

== Installation ==

It does not require other dependencies other than build-essentials and GTK+ 2.0 Libraries. It can be installed by standard configure, make & make install

However, if it doesn't work, run ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr

== Comments ==

<nowiki>[[IrvinPiraman]]</nowiki>: There was already a spec drafted like this but deferred for dapper. https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+spec/home-user-backup

<nowiki>[[joelbryan| Joel Bryan Juliano]]</nowiki> I've been reading the wiki, and specifications, and been fantasizing with HomeUserBackup GUI, how it would look like, and I've been thinking, how friendly a backup tool can get, I test my curiosity, so I made one, UbuntuHomeBackup.

<nowiki>[[sardion]]</nowiki> The source package here requires automake1.9 which is in the repos but not installed by default.  The package should be updated, but for now, if you have trouble compiling do aptitude install automake1.9.

<nowiki>[[VincentZekred| Vincent]]</nowiki> I successfully installed it, but when I run it I get the following error: {{{
$ ubuntu-home-backup 
/usr/local/bin/ubuntu-home-backup: line 6: /usr/libexec/ubuntu-home-backup-gui: No such file or directory}}}
I installed it with <code>./autogen.sh</code> , <code>make</code>, then <code>sudo checkinstall</code>.

<nowiki>[[Robert523| Robert]]</nowiki> It's missing the /local directory, just edit line 6 to read /usr/local/libexec/ubuntu-home-backup-gui 

<nowiki>[[vaidab| Vaida Bogdan]]</nowiki> It needs encryption. I wouldn't use it otherwise.
