Daniel Holbach continues updating the community in his ongoing Development Update series. UDS kicked off the current Precise development cycle into high gear and Holbach notes that a total of 1704 packages have been uploaded since October 13, 2011. With two weeks left before the Feature Definition Freeze currently scheduled for November 24, 2011 and Alpha 1 is scheduled shortly there after on December 1, 2011 everything in the current 12.04 LTS release cycle seems to be on track.

Holbach also links to the UDS video interviews and highlights Ubuntu developer Evan Broder in this installment of the 12.04 Development Update.

==== Find out more about LoCo Teams and Events ====

Just a reminder to those who may not be familiar with the Ubuntu Local Community (Lo``Co) Team Portal.  The Lo``Co directory as it is often referred to is more than a place to look up whether a Lo``Co team is approved or not.  It’s a place where you can see if there are others in your area of the world participating in Ubuntu.  There is an Ubuntu Lo``Co teams blog section where teams are encouraged to write about what they are doing.  There is even an events section to see when teams are meeting and what events they are planning or even attending.

Take a look at this resource and find out how you and your Lo``Co can participate and share what you’re doing with the rest of the Ubuntu Lo``Co Community.
