==== How Apple killed the Linux desktop ====

Klint Finely of WIRED magazine writes about how the Linux desktop struggles to keep up with Apple’s OS X. Finely points out the thoughts of Miguel de Icaza regarding the failure of the Linux desktop: “The real reason Linux lost is that developers started defecting to OS X because the developers behind the toolkits used to build graphical Linux applications didn't do a good enough job ensuring backward compatibility between different versions of their APIs. For many years, we broke people's code. OS X did a much better job of ensuring backward compatibility."
