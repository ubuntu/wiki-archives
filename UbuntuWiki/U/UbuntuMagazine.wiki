== Guidelines ==

The single rule for an article is; it must somehow be linked to Ubuntu or one of the many derivatives of Ubuntu (Kubuntu, Xubuntu, Edubuntu etc).

'''Please follow these rules :'''

* For advice, please refer to our '''Official Style Guide''': http://url.fullcirclemagazine.org/75d471

* Write your article in whichever software you choose, I would recommend Libre``Office or Google Docs, but most importantly - '''PLEASE SPELL AND GRAMMAR CHECK IT!'''

* Do NOT format your article with bold/italic/tables. Formatting will be added when it is pasted into Scribus.

* Insert images into your article by embedding the image in the ODT (Open Office) or Google Docs document.

* Images should be JPG, no wider than 1000 pixels, and use low compression.

* If you are writing a review, please follow the guidelines on the /MonthlyReviews page.

When you are ready to submit your article please email it to: articles@fullcirclemagazine.org

We always need help with articles. If you need ideas then check our /HowTo page.

If your native language is not English, don't worry, write your article and one of the team will proof-read it for you and email you with recommended change so not only are you helping the magazine and the community but we'll help you with your English!

If you want to drop us some Linux news, please email it to news@fullcirclemagazine.org.

Your comments and suggestions should be emailed to letters@fullcirclemagazine.org
