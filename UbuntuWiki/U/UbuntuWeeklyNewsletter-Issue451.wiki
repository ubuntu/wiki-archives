He notes that the lack of members attending IRC meetings means that the Team``Reports page is out of date, and asks that he be contacted if anyone has any questions, comments or concerns.

==== Serge Hallyn: Cgroups are now handled a bit differently in Xenial ====

Serge Hallyn walks us through some of the trouble that the existing cgroup implementation has caused. He shares how it’s being reworked in Xenial with the new libpam-cgm package and which ultimately reduces the set of user-owned cgroups.

The article concludes by talking about the opportunities that open source has brought both The Working Centre and individuals who have been involved in the project.

Martin Pitt reports from a recent Canonical Foundations team sprint, sharing slides from a presentation he gave to open the gathering.

He concludes: “We are going to have similar sprints for Brian’s error tracker, Robert’s CI train, and Barry’s system-image builder in the next weeks. Let’s increase all those bus factors from the current “1” to at least “4” ``:-) . Looking forward to these!”

=== Other Community News ===

==== Find-a-task 2.0 ====

Nicholas Skaggs kicks off a discussion about the future (2.0) of Ubuntu Find-a-task, a tool which helps new contributors find ways to contribute to Ubuntu. He lists a series of issues and considerations as the team moves forward, including the fact that tasks never expire, a lack of information (including point of contact) in some tasks, and the success rate of using the tool. After outlining a plan, he concludes: “Keep the idea of tasks,
but add sponsors to the tasks, and help facilitate communication between
the interested contributor and sponsor.”
