__TOC__

The Ubuntu Bleeding Edge Team aims to lower the barrier to testing upstream code by providing up to date binaries compiled from the latest VCS commits.

Any bugs found with the packages should be filled in the upstream bug tracking system and _not_ filed against the Ubuntu package.

Support for bugs in bleeding edge packages (after they have been confirm as such by upstream) is available at #ubuntu-bleedingedge
