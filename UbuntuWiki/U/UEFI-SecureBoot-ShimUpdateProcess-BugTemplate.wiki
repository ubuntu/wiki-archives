[Impact]
Shim needs to be updated for the latest fixes, security fixes, and new features
introduced upstream (see below). Shim is kept in sync across supported releases
to avoid subtle policy differences between releases, and because any upload
requires a round-trip of signing at Microsoft, which makes individual uploads
time-consuming.

[Test case]
Test plan is at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/UEFI/SecureBoot/ShimUpdateProcess/TestPlan

[Regression potential]
<describe what could possibly go wrong?>

---

Update shim in all supported releases of Ubuntu.
