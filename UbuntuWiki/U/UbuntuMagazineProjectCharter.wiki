<nowiki>[[File:process_flow_insert-070862.png]]</nowiki>

==== D.3 Exclusions ====

Marketing efforts not directly related to the publishing of the Magazine will be considered out of scope.

==== D.4 Key Stakeholders ====

* Canonical Ltd. (referred to as “Canonical“)
* Ubuntu Community
* Artwork Team
* Marketing Team
* Magazine Team

==== D.5 Assumptions ====

 1. It is assumed the delivery mechanism of the Magazine will be the Internet.
 2. Lacking marketing research data documenting the need for such a publication, it is assumed the readership is there and a quality publication will be an asset to the Community.
 3. The Magazine will be the official publication of the Community and other similar publications will not be endorsed.
 4. The Magazine will represent Ubuntu Products as specified in section B.
 5. Canonical servers have the capacity and bandwidth to host such an endeavor and will be available to those in need on a timely bases.
 6. Data backups will be timely and the amount of data lost in the event of a server failure will be no more than 1 day.
 7. Data marked as confidential will be secured in an appropriate manner.
 8. Critical staff assignments will be filled with individuals with the time and the talent to fulfill their obligations.
 9. Initial copies of the Magazine will be English with other translations occurring as soon as resources become available.

==== D.6 Constraints ====

 1. ''Product Identification is Ambiguous''<<BR>><<BR>>The clear identification of Ubuntu Products is lacking. The product name Ubuntu is used to identify the Community and to identify Ubuntu Linux – Gnome Desktop. Although Kubuntu and Xubuntu are branded in such a manner as to segregate them from other products, to the new user it may be unclear that Kubuntu is really Ubuntu Linux – KDE Desktop and Xubuntu is really Ubuntu Linux – XFCE Desktop. In addition there is no branding for the Ubuntu server family and the new user may not understand Edubuntu is really Ubuntu Linux – Gnome Desktop targeted to schools and young children.<<BR>><<BR>>

 2. ''Lack of Market Research''<<BR>><<BR>>At the moment there is no market research giving direction to the project. It is assumed readers will connect to the Magazine forum to offer comments and suggestions and this will become the market research data to give direction to future editions of the magazine.<<BR>><<BR>>

 3. ''Lack of Incentives''<<BR>><<BR>>In the hard core commercial world of marketing incentives are often used to gain participation. To illustrate, the best artwork submitted receives a coupon good for Ubuntu marketing items (CD's, hats, or shirts).

=== E. Project critical Success Factors ===

 1. Staff all positions and identify subject matter experts

 2. Active participation of readership in Magazine forum

 3. Active participation of Magazine, Art, and Marketing team members

 4. Support of Project Sponsors

 5. Availability of Magazine

 6. Readership numbers justify the publishing effort

=== F. Initial High-level Project Planning ===

==== F.1 Estimated Resource Requirements ====

* Hosting server with an appropriate DNS with the capacity and bandwidth to handle readership

* Development platform ''Ubuntu'', ''Launchpad'', and ''Bazaar'' with the capacity and bandwidth to handle publication

* Magazine forum

* Magazine editor

* Content review board

* (2) Ubuntu – Gnome Desktop reporters

* (2) Ubuntu - KDE Desktop reporters

* (2) Ubuntu - XFCE Desktop reporters

* (1) Ubuntu - Server reporter

* (1) Edubuntu reporter

* (2) Reporters at large<<BR>><<BR>>~-''Note - The goal is to have a reporter and backup for each product area and a reporter at larger to cover community and LoCoTeams events.''-~

==== F.2 Estimated Project Cost ====

* Hosting

* Canonical over site

* Travel to identified Linux events of importance

* Printed materials

* Marketing incentives such as product CD's and other promotional items<<BR>><<BR>>~-''Note - Reported as resources not dollars.''-~

==== F.3 Estimated Benefits ====

* It is estimated a timely and professionally crafted Magazine will further increase the use of Ubuntu Products in general and increase usage specifically in markets where Linux is not favored. It is further estimated the open source software included in Ubuntu Products will benefit from such a publication.

* It is anticipated a quality publication will assist in forging alliances with manufactures of computer equipment to the extent Ubuntu Products will be offered as an alternative.

* It is further expected participation in the Community will rise as the processes put in place incorporate Ubuntu Values and fosters an atmosphere of inclusion.

* It is assumed the successful launch of such a publication will open other marketing opportunities such as endorsements and alliances with other media markets.

* It is anticipated this publication will bring Ubuntu to equal footing with its peers in the Linux community who offer similar publications.

==== G.2 Controls ====

The process of publication will include reviews and validations to insure the content is factual and is harmonious with the goals of the Community and contains the spirit of Ubuntu Values. Although the exact mechanism is to be determined, a '''content review board''' with representatives from Canonical, Community, Marketing, Art, and the Magazine could be the final authority on the quality of the materials submitted.
