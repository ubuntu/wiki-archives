This page tells how to make Ubuntu Studio desktop agnostic, and all the parts and bits that are a part of that.

Source packages involved in making this happen:

* ubuntustudio-live - ubiquity plugin needed for selecting DE and installing it over the internet
* ubuntustudio-default-settings - desktop settings need to become agnostic (a few methods can achieve this)
* ubuntustudio-look - theming needs to work for several DEs, if theming is deemed valuable enough to develop
* ubuntustudio-menu - needs to work on all DE choices that have menus
