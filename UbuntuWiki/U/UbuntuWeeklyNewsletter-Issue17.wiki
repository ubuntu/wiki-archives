=== General Community News ===

The winner of the $100 USD Ubuntu Video contest has been announced. Mous, the creator of multiple Linux gaming videos, was selected because his videos presented an image of Ubuntu that challenges the assumptions people have about Linux gaming. His work was widely circulated and appeared in multiple gaming forums, receiving very positive feedback. You can see the full announcement and his videos at http://www.ubuntuvideo.com/and_the_winner_is

==== Kubuntu/Debian KDE Extras ====

==== New Bluetooth Team ====

Daniel Holbach announced the formation of the Bluetooth Team for Ubuntu. As Edgy is but a few weeks away, the main goal is to look towards Edgy+1 to "make it nice and sweet" in the words of Daniel. You can read more at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bluetooth and https://launchpad.net/people/bluetooth

=== Changes in Edgy ===

This week was fairly quiet in Edgy, as we approach the final release.

Users of Xen will be pleased to see that xen-3.0 3.0.3~rc1 came out this week, thanks to the hard work of Andrew Mitchell and Chuck Short. Later in the week Andrew updated to the rc2 release.

Fabio M Di Nitto uploaded a number of cluster packages this week, including the new Openais 0.80.1 and redhat-cluster-suite 2.20061002. The latter includes changes from a bugsquishing party held upstream.

The printing world got a little saner this week, with Till Kamppeter uploading foomatic-db-engine 3.0.2-20060925, which merges all of Ubuntu and Debian's patches upstream. Till also uploaded foomatic-db-hpijs 20060925 while Martin Pitt merged cupsys 1.2.4 from Debian, including a great many bug fixes. Finally cups-pdf 2.4.2 was synced from Debian.

A few of the gnustep packages were also synced from Debian this week. They include gnustep-base 1.13.0, gnustep-gui 0.11.0 and gnustep-make 1.13.0.

In the Java world, libjcommon-java 1.0.6 arrived this week, which allowed the package to move to universe, now that it builds with Free Java. Likewise libjfreechart-java 1.0.2 was uploaded by Mattias Klose and moved to universe. Also uploaded was ecj-bootstrap 3.2.1, synced from Debian.

Bazaar, the distributed revision control tool, was updated to 0.11 by Etienne Goyer. The new release brings speed improvements and other changes. You can read more at https://lists.canonical.com/archives/bazaar-ng/2006q4/017779.html

If you feel the need to mix your Python and .NET, the 1.0 release of Ironpython was uploaded by Matthias Klose. You can read the 1.0 release notes at http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=IronPython&title=v1.0%20Release%20Notes

==== Ubuntu ====

Andrew Mitchell uploaded the new 0.2.1 release of F-spot, the photo management application. Aside a huge number of bug fixes, this version brings support for scaling images when they are being emailed, exporting them in the correct rotation and Picasa export support. 

In the artwork world, there were a number of new packages this week. Frank Schoep uploaded edgy-community-wallpapers 0.2-0 and later in the week Daniel Holbach uploaded 0.3 of the same package. Daniel also uploaded human-icon-theme 0.4, which adds new emblems from the Art Team. Finally, Daniel uploaded edgy-gdm-themes 0.4 and ubuntu-sounds 0.5. The new ubuntu-sounds package might solve https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+bug/61530, where it was discovered that the Teardown spec had shortened the shutdown procedure so much that the shutdown sound was being silenced too early.

The Telepathy team was very quiet this week, with only telepathy-butterfly 0.1.1 being uploaded by Samuel Maftoul.

A few other pieces of the Ubuntu desktop got updated this week, including the new poppler 0.5.4 and rhythmbox 0.9.6. Both uploaded by Sebastian Bacher, the new Rhythmbox includes some DAAP fixes, ID3 tag writing issues, UI and i18n improvements and more. You can read more at http://www.gnome.org/projects/rhythmbox/news.html. Also uploaded this week was ubuntu-meta 1.26 and 1.27, the former of which added onboard, libgl1-mesa-glx, linuxprinting.org-ppds, util-linux-locales while moving gnome-games to recommends. 1.27 also added avahi-daemon to the default install.

One of the most interesting new apps in Edgy this week is backstep 0.3, a tool to draw icons of minimized apps on the desktop. You can read more about Backstep at http://backstep.sourceforge.net/

==== Kubuntu ====

The kubuntu-meta packages saw two updates this week, both by Anthony Mercatante, 1.15 and 1.16. The former added digikam and removed kmplayer-konq-plugins from kubuntu-desktop and the latter reverted the previous change to read the plugins back in.

==== Xubuntu ====

The week started with the Xubuntu people finishing the split up of the XFFM file manager package. As such, Gauvain Pocentek and David Valot uploaded xffm-samba 4.5.0, xffm-filemanager 4.5.0, xffm-gui 4.5.0, xffm-fstab 4.5.0, xffm-recent 4.5.0, xffm-icons 4.5.0, xffm-trash 4.5.0, xffm-proc 4.5.0. A few days later Gauvain uploaded the xffm4 4.5.0, which is the new modular metapackage. 

Xffm was not the only piece of Xubuntu that saw changes this week. Jani Monoses uploaded the new xubuntu-system-tools 2.15.5, which is a branch of the gnome-system-tools. Jani also uploaded xfce4-dict-plugin 0.2.0, xfce4-mailwatch-plugin 1.0.1, and  xfwm4 4.3.99.1svn+r23289. Gauvain Pocentek uploaded the first release of xfce4-cpu-freq-plugin, 0.0.1. Two changes to the xubuntu-meta package came this week, 2.14, which added gxine, onboard and xfce4-dict-plugin to the desktop, and one of the last uploads of the week, 2.15, which adds the system-config-printer tool to the desktop.

==== Ichthux ====

The Ichthux team continued their work this week. Raphael Pinson uploaded ichthux-meta 1.0ubuntu2, which adds ichthux-artwork-usplash, ichthux-default-settings, and sword-language-pack-nl to the default install. Jordan Mantha also uploaded ichthux-docs 6.10, the initial upload of the documentation for this distro. 

=== In The Press ===

Benjamin Smedberg of Mozilla raised some concerns about the cathedral-like nature of Ubuntu (and any other distros) archives. He wondered about how Ubuntu can manage new applications and the ability for people to install from the "Bazaar", as he called it. You can read more at http://benjamin.smedbergs.us/blog/2006-10-04/is-ubuntu-an-operating-system/

Newsforge reports on Benetech, a charity whose mission is to use technology to improve the world.  They use Kubuntu and Ubuntu on their desktops Ball cited Ubuntu's ease of setup and installation as the reason for the switch. ''"If you have to roll out 10 or 15 machines, Gentoo's [inconvenient]. Most of our machines are Kubuntu, but there are a couple of GNOME people in our organization."''

ZDNet takes a look at Canonical as it gears up and shoots for profitability:

''Canonical is the 65-employee start-up behind a popular version of Linux called "Ubuntu". The company is betting that it can win a place in the market using a strategy that dominant Linux seller Red Hat has dropped.''

''Red Hat offers two versions of Linux: Fedora Core and Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Fedora Core is free, but relatively untested and unsupported by Red Hat, while RHEL is supported and certified, but must be purchased. With Canonical's Ubuntu, however, the free and supported versions are identical--the approach Red Hat abandoned in 2003.''

''"We believe that Ubuntu should be free to everyone--not just a trial version, but our very best version," said Christopher Kenyon, Canonical's business development manager. The South African company even ships free CDs anywhere in the world. Using that strategy, it expects profitability within 24 months, he added.''

==== New features in Apport ====

Apport is a new tool in Edgy to allow users to collect backtraces, amongst other things. There were two major announcments about it this week. The first relates to duplicate bugs. Often a single bug will be duplicated many times. Rather than have lots of duplicates filed, it is better to redirect that person to a common bug. As such, Martin Pitt, the developer of Apport, has announced Bug Patterns. You can read more at https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2006-October/021502.html

The 2nd piece of news involves the retrace tool, which is used for developers to process backtraces after the fact. This allows the direct downloading of the ddebs (debs containing the debug symbols) and then rerun the stack trace to get better debugging symbols. You can read more at 
https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2006-October/021500.html
