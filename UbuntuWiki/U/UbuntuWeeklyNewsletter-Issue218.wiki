==== Announcing the next Ubuntu User Days Event ====

We are pleased to announce that the next Ubuntu User Days (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UserDays) event is scheduled to take place from Saturday January 29th 2011, 09:45 UTC until Sunday January 30th 2011, 03:00 UTC. To quote the wiki page, "User Days was created to be a set of courses offered during a one day period to teach the beginning or intermediate Ubuntu user the basics to get them started with Ubuntu". Logs (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UserDaysTeam/lucid) from the last Ubuntu User Days event are also available for anyone who might be interested.

In order for this event to be a success, we need lots of help leading sessions. To volunteer to lead a session, you can contact a member of the Ubuntu User Days Team (https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-user-days/+members) by sending an email to theubuntu-classroom at lists.ubuntu.com mailing list or on IRC by stopping by #ubuntu-classroom-backstage on irc.freenode.net. If you are unsure of a topic for your session, you can use the Course Suggestions wiki page (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UserDaysTeam/CourseSuggestions) as a reference. Please be sure to pass this information along to any of your friends who might be interested in either participating or leading a session.

Announcing Ubuntu Cloud Portal

Located at cloud.ubuntu.com, the Ubuntu Cloud Portal "helps new-comers to the Ubuntu cloud community quickly find interesting information they may care about such as documentation to read/edit, projects that may interest them and so on. In this first release the following is available."

http://foss-boss.blogspot.com/2010/12/announcing-ubuntu-cloud-portal.html

==== Announcing Ubuntu IRC Membership ====

I am pleased to announce that the Ubuntu IRC Council is now ready to start accepting applications for Ubuntu IRC Membership (https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-irc-members). The Ubuntu IRC Members team represents the people who have made a significant contribution to Ubuntu through the IRC medium. Applications to join this team are done through a process (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/IRC/Membership#Preparing%20your%20application) very similar to what you might go through (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership#Procedure%20for%20Obtaining%20Membership) to acquire membership from any other board or council in the community.

Please remember, Ubuntu IRC Membership is a way for people to acquire Ubuntu Membership for IRC contributions. Some examples of what these might include are available on the wiki (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/IRC/Membership#IRC%20Specific%20Contributions). For more general contributions, you should apply through a Regional Membership Board (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/RegionalBoards).

By becoming an Ubuntu IRC Member, you gain all of the benefits (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership#Benefits%20of%20Membership) granted by normal Ubuntu Membership as well as the privilege of voting in various polls of the Ubuntu IRC community by becoming a member of the ~ubuntu-irc-members team on Launchpad. This includes voting for members of the Ubuntu IRC Council.

If you have any questions about Ubuntu IRC Membership, please feel free to contact a member of the Ubuntu IRC Council (https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-irc-council).

==== Ubuntu-California.org Launched! ====

Elizabeth Krumbach, one of the leadership trio of the Ubuntu California team, talks about the process of creation and launch of the team's new website and ideas for additional components that the team wants to include moving forward.

http://princessleia.com/journal/?p=3829

=== Launchpad News ===

==== Removing team polls ====

The Launchpad team announces the removal of team polls, citing problematic user interface and feature set, and lack of popularity (only 500 polls since inception in 2006).

http://blog.launchpad.net/?p=1860

==== Changing how we track Launchpad’s bugs, questions and blueprints ====

From today, all Launchpad bugs, code, questions and blueprints are tracked under the onelaunchpad project.

We’ve already moved everything from the individual projects over to the parent launchpadproject. All you need do differently is search/file bugs, questions and blueprints under thatparent Launchpad project, rather than Rosetta, for example.

Don’t worry, though, there are redirects in place so that old links will still work.

There are also a couple of one-time steps you may need to take:

* Update your bug subscriptions: if you’re subscribed to individual bugs, you need do nothing. If you’re subscribed to all bugs for a particular project, Malone for example, you’ll now need to subscribe to all Launchpad bugs.
* Check your answer contact status: if you’re an answer contact for one particular application in Launchpad, and want to continue as such, you’ll need to become an answer contact for all of Launchpad.

To start with, bugs that we’ve merged in from one of the old sub-projects will have a tag that shows which project it came from. However, we’re planning to drop those tags once everyone’s settled into using just the one project.

Our code hosting won’t change at all as we’ve always hosted code under the parent Launchpad project.

This new approach will better reflect that Launchpad is one codebase but will also have a big practical benefit: it’ll be easier to find bugs and dupes because everything will be under the same project.

For more, including rationale, read the rest at: http://blog.launchpad.net/?p=1863

==== Caching Ubuntu Package Downloads ====

Alan Pope has a new server and a household with several Ubuntu systems. In addition to keeping these all updated, in the course of testing he is required to re-download the same packages as he tests different install methods. He discusses his use of the squid-deb-proxy package to cache Ubuntu package downloads, speeding up testing and putting less stress on the repositories.

==== Natty Translations Plans I-III ====

David Planella has written a series of posts discussing the progress of the translations plans in Natty.

In the first he talks about the launch of Translations Stories where they'd "like to show how translations change people’s lives for the best, and how the work of translators has an impact on that. We’d like to share our excitement and highlight the awesome work translators do, and we thought that articles with translations stories would be the perfect vehicle for that."

He also discusses the steps you can take to contribute.

http://davidplanella.wordpress.com/?p=645

In the second he announces Translations Training Sessions. They wish to hold "a series of regular events where translators can just attend and learn, in a hands-on way, all the different aspects of translating our favourite distro. There, they should also be able to ask their questions and discuss any topics related to translations. Another goal is to also provide material for all teams to adapt and reuse for their own training events for new translators"

http://davidplanella.wordpress.com/?p=810

In the third he announces the the Ubuntu Translations Portal inital test deployment. "The idea behind the portal is to aggregate all existing content and to be the main entry point to the translations community for new contributors, providing them answers, inspiration and excitement. For experienced translators it will be a central point for resources and news about translating Ubuntu."

His post gives step by step instructions on how to contribute.

==== Ubuntu Screencasts:  How To Sign the Ubuntu Code of Conduct ====

The Ubuntu Screencasts team has released their latest screen cast - this time walking users through how to sign the Ubuntu Code of Conduct.

** ACTION: topyli to send formal agreement to ikonia's suggestion on mailing list

** TOPIC: Clearing the ban list

** Decided to clear all old bans without comments on them, giving ops a week's grace time to document important bans

** ACTION: nhandler to send mail about the sweep

===== LoCo Council =====

* We had a Lo``Co Council meeting on October 19th. Topics discussed:

** UDS-M Blueprint

** Sit down one night next week at UDS via skype/gobby and spend 2 hours getting UDS-M bp all done

** UDS-N Blueprint

** https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/ubuntutheproject-n-loco-council

** Lo``Co Team {re}approvals

** Ubuntu-NI - Re-approved

** Ubuntu-US-CO - Re-approved

** Ubuntu-US-OH - Re-approved

===== Technical Board =====

* Meeting 2010-10-05

** Chair: Colin Watson

** Present: Kees Cook, Matt Zimmerman, Martin Pitt

** Apologies: Mark Shuttleworth

** Guests: Michael Vogt, Jamie Strandboge

** Action review

** Martin Pitt to ask Martin Pool about bzr self test instructions on installed system -- DONE

** Kees to add bzr selftest to qa-regression-testing project -- DONE

** Martin to add bzr microrelease exception to Stable``ReleasePolicy -- DONE

** Decide/document ubuntu-archive interaction with ARB packages

** Michael Vogt confirmed that extras.ubuntu.com is a mirror of a PPA owned by the ARB, which means that ubuntu-archive will have no direct interaction with it as it stands.

** [ACTION] Colin to ensure that documentation on nature of extras.ubuntu.com archive makes it into process docs, and ensure that ARB legality checks are synchronised with those of ubuntu-archive

** Decide on permission changes documented in Bug: 174375 - Matt Zimmerman

** The TB voted in favour of Brian's proposal.

** Martin noted that bug targeting needs to be more open than just release managers (Brian's proposal asks that it shouldn't exclude uploaders).  There was no disagreement.  The main goal here is to separate the blueprint and bug permissions currently aggregated into ubuntu-drivers.

** [ACTION] Matt to follow up with Brian on Bug: 174375

** Chromium security updates (continuation of previous discussion)

** General consensus seems to be that we can drop the seven-day waiting period on promotion to -updates for chromium-browser, but should not drop -proposed and some kind of verification.

** While this still seems too immature for main, the security team will need to treat it essentially like the non-free Flash plugin: it's universe and therefore theoretically unsupported by the security team, but in practice we know lots of people use it and act accordingly, running updates through all the usual checklists.  Regressions on individual web pages and such won't merit a USN, though.

** Jamie says that qa-regression-testing has a semi-automatic script which should catch any huge issues here.

** The board is currently awaiting a proposal from the principal uploader, Fabien Tassin, and a formal vote will wait for that.

** No new community bugs to look at

** Next chair: Kees Cook

** couchdb on lucid: backport 1.0

** https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/technical-board/2010-November/000563.html

** Ubuntu``One cloud servers got updated to couchdb 1.0 to handle the load and SSL

** According to README and James Westby, the 0.10 -> 1.0 upgrade needs to be done manually for the system wide instance

** Impact on per-user couchdbs to be clarified

** API is said to not have changed "much", but any change will break existing couchdb applications, and thus needs to be clarified and evaluated

** will cause problems with shared home directories and clients with mixed 1.0/0.1 packages

** To be investigated by U1 team: introduce couchdb-1.0 package into lucid; what other packages need to be changed, what's the impact?

** To be re-discussed at next meeting with more information on the wiki page

** ARB exception proposal

** https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PostReleaseApps/MaverickExceptionsProposal

** Public python libraries shouldn't be a matter for these packages

** Private libraries could be kept in the app dir by setting sys.path

*** Can quickly templates be updated in lucid to automatically add the application dir to sys.path?

*** Non-quickly apps would have a requirement to set this up by themselves; is that practical?

** .pyc files are not a must, so we could ship maverick packages without them

** general opinion was that making an exception for desktop files only would be okay

** Some discussion whether using a vendor prefix in /opt would make sense

** Next chair: sabdfl (carried over)

* Meeting 2010-11-30

** Log: http://www.novarata.net/mootbot/ubuntu-meeting.20101130_0859.html

** Chair: Matt Zimmerman

** Other members present: Martin Pitt

** Guests: Allison Randall, John Lenton, Eric Casteleijn, Rick Spencer, Stuart Langridge, Emmet Hikory

** Action review

** KDE microversion SRU docs - done

** couchdb lucid backport SRU - John Lenton (http://www.novarata.net/mootbot/ubuntu-meeting.log.20101130_0859.html#3)

** Continuation from the previous meeting

** We enumerated options for the Ubuntu One team to restore lost functionality in Ubuntu 10.04 resulting from the CouchDB 1.0 server-side update. The options supported by the TB members present were:

*** option 1: parallel package couchdb 1.0, update desktopcouch to use it, and release via SRU exception

*** option 3: update couchdb to 1.0 in backports, superseding 0.1 in lucid

*** option 4: do nothing, focus on natty, move on

** The U1 team will decide which option to pursue based on available resources and business considerations 

** ARB exception proposal - Allison Randal (http://www.novarata.net/mootbot/ubuntu-meeting.log.20101130_0859.html#5)

** Continuation from the previous meeting

** Allison's proposal was supported by the TB members present:

*** Allow .desktop files to be installed outside /opt.

*** In Natty, we'll modify Quickly, cdbs, python-support, and related packages o support installation in /opt.

*** For Maverick, accept that .pyc files and version symlinks won't be generated for Python libraries.

*** For Maverick, ARB will perform manual package fixes on proposed applications, to install in /opt and load libraries from /opt.

*** Binaries only in /opt (no exceptions for Maverick), will not be in $PATH.

*** Official install location is /opt/extras.ubuntu.com/ (with version number? i.e. "/opt/extras.ubuntu.com/foo-1.5")
