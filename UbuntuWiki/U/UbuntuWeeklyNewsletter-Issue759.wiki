=== In the Press ===

==== Ubuntu 22.10 is a subtle, polished release that proves boring can be good ====

Jack Wallen expresses the feeling that boring releases can be a good thing, noting Canonical's last "truly innovative" release included the Unity desktop where most users weren't "pleased". Since then Jack expresses the view that most changes are now just changes in GNOME, with Ubuntu 22.10 a "small step forward" and a "rock-solid desktop operating system". Jack gives reasons why Ubuntu Desktop is his "go-to recommendation" for new users, giving features that will be appreciated by new users and veterans. Jack lists things he likes in the release, including screenshots of this "wonderful release".

https://www.techrepublic.com/article/ubuntu-polished-release/

==== Ubuntu Studio is the Linux distribution for audio and video creators ====

Jack Wallen writes that Ubuntu Studio "comes with a very good mix of applications for audio and video productions" and provides a list of those applications. Whilst Jack notes those apps are easily installed on any Ubuntu system, he then highlights the latency issues dealt with by Ubuntu Studio's use of the low-latency kernel. The recent Ubuntu Studio 22.10 is highlighted with some clues as to new features.

https://www.zdnet.com/article/ubuntu-studio-is-the-linux-distribution-for-audio-and-video-creators/

==== Ubuntu 22.10 shines on MicroPython, microcontrollers ====

Paul Krill writes about Ubuntu 22.10 and the introduction of "Micro``Python support on a variety of microcontrollers". We are told how this can help those using devices like the Raspberry Pi Pico W boards, including some other apps now available in the Ubuntu repositories, particularly if using the Arm or Risc processors. A list of new improvements is provided.

https://www.infoworld.com/article/3677575/ubuntu-22-10-shines-on-micropython-microcontrollers.html

==== KDE 5.26 gets a second point release (yes, already) ====

Liam Proven tells us KDE 5.26.2 is out with an "emergency fix for a memory leak". We are reminded 5.26 was released on 11 October, with 5.26.1 a week later with some "minor bug fixes", with this version needing to disable the animated wallpapers (on X11). We are reminded that KDE 5.26 came out too late for inclusion in Kubuntu 22.10, but is available via the Kubuntu backports PPA (instructions for this are provided).

https://www.theregister.com/2022/10/27/kde_5_26_2/

=== In the Blogosphere ===

==== You Can Upgrade to KDE Plasma 5.26 on Kubuntu 22.10 ====

Joey Sneddon tells us Kubuntu 22.10 & Ubuntu Studio 22.10 users can upgrade to KDE Plasma 5.26 via the Kubuntu backports PPA. A warning is provided on this move, along with commands to achieve the upgrade. If you decide you don't like it, Joey briefly walks through the ppa-purge package and commands which allow reversion to the KDE Plasma 5.25 Kubuntu 22.10 came with.

https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2022/10/install-kde-plasma-5-26-kubuntu-22-10

==== Canonical’s Steam Snap Will Let You Switch Mesa Stacks ====

Joey Sneddon writes that "Ubuntu gamers will soon be able to pick which Mesa graphics stack" their Steam snap app uses. Joey gives details on how Canonical plans to achieve this, with details of the three tracks that will be available (through contact snaps). Joey tells us the beta-quality Steam snap has been downloaded 75,000 times, though it is noted the majority still download Steam using deb packages.

https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2022/10/canonicals-steam-snap-will-let-you-switch-between-different-mesa-stacks

==== How I Fixed My Blurry Firefox on HiDPI + Wayland ====

Joey Sneddon writes that his 2K screen on his Ubuntu laptop is "pin sharp", alas firefox was not. Joey tells us he uses Wayland, has fractional scaling at 125% and uses development builds of Firefox, and acknowledges most users won't notice any issue. But in this post he writes how he fixed it. Joey notes there is a reason why this 'fix' isn't default, thus suggests you test it before making the 'fix permanent'. Joey also reports this "unlocks" proper touchscreen support in Firefox. He reports it makes Firefox as great as using Web/Epiphany, and ends with the command to achieve the same thing in Google Chrome.

https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2022/10/fix-firefox-blurry-wayland-fonts-ubuntu

==== “Old/weird laptops” sought to help test Linux kernel backlight drivers ====

Kevin Purdy writes that Hans de Goede has asked for testing of backlight controls with the Linux kernel 6.1 to ensure backlight functions aren't lost with the newer kernel. We are told major changes to "user space backlight controls" have occurred, with some details on issues involved provided. Some clues are provided on how to test, with a link to de Goede's post provided for added details.

** Old & Weird Laptops Risk Seeing Broken Backlight Controls With Linux 6.1 - https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.1-Old-Laptop-Backlights

==== Ubuntu 22.10 Gets First Kernel Security Update to Address Recent Wi-Fi Stack Vulnerabilities ====

Marius Nestor tells us Canonical has published their first Linux kernel security update for Ubuntu 22.10 to address security vulnerabilities. We are told six vulnerabilities are fixed, given the CVEs, who discovered the flaws, plus how they could be utilized maliciously if left unpatched, plus the kernel version which contains the fix. We are advised to patch our systems and reboot.

==== Ubuntu 23.04 Codename Revealed – And It’s a Lucently Likeable Label ====

Joey Sneddon writes the codename for Ubuntu 23.04 has been revealed, including a cryptic tweet from the official Ubuntu Twitter account. Joey writes about the words: Lunar Lobster, and tells us the release is due out on 27 April 2023.

https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2022/10/ubuntu-23-04-codename

==== Ubuntu 23.04 Development Gets Started As The "Lunar Lobster" ====

Michael Larabel writes that Canonical engineers, having completed the release of Ubuntu 22.10 last week, have started work on the next release Ubuntu 23.04 codenamed "Lunar Lobster". Along with the release date (27 April 2023) we are given some expected inclusions.

==== NVIDIA Driver 520 available to install in Ubuntu 22.04 | 20.04 | 18.04 ====

Ji m tells us Nvidia 520, Nvidia's latest driver, is available for all Ubuntu LTS releases. Giving us some features that are included, this post tells us how to install it, along with showing us some screen shots of what we'll see on some releases.

https://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2022/10/nvidia-driver-520-install-ubuntu/

==== A New ‘KDE Control Centre’ Widget Inspired by iOS ====

Joey Sneddon asks us if we like the look of the macOS and iOS control centre, then tells us we can have something like it if we're using the KDE Plasma desktop. We are invited to check out 'Control Centre', a 3rd party widget rather like what macOS/iOS users use. Details and links are provided for this "open source add-on for the KDE Plasma desktop".
