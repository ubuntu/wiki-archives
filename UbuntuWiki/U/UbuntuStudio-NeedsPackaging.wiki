== Adding Things That Need to be Packaged ==

If you feel something needs to be packaged for Ubuntu Studio, add the application here. Generally, we don't package for Ubuntu, but instead for Debian, so the work is really done in Debian and for Ubuntu Studio related applications - most of that which is dealt within the debian-multimedia team, so make sure to become a member! Also, <nowiki>[[https://wiki.debian.org/DebianMentorsFaq#How_do_I_add_a_new_package_to_the_archive.3F|read about how to add a package to Debian]]</nowiki>.
