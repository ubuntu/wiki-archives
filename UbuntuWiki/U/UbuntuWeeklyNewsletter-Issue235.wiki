=== In The Blogosphere ===

==== Ubuntu Friendly Hardware Certification Program Maturing ====

Christopher Tozzi, reviews the Ubuntu Friendly program. Tozzi says, "If Canonical had its way, OEMs would make sure Ubuntu ran well on their hardware before shipping it. But most OEMs don’t, so Ubuntu developers have resorted to the next best thing: crowd-sourcing hardware validation to users via the Ubuntu Friendly program, which is almost ready for prime time." In this post he notes that he tried out the Ubuntu Friendly using a KVM virtual machine to review it and concludes, "The Ubuntu Friendly project itself won’t revolutionize Ubuntu, but it does represent a smart investment on Canonical’s part... It’s a win-win."
