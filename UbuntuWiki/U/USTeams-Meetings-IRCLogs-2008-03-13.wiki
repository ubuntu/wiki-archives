22:39 <+greg-g[MI]> rick_h__: I was just being hammered on by jcastro to be a sheep and change my hackergotchi 20 minutes prior, I can only take so much peer pressure
22:40 < ianmcorvidae> yeah, same deal for me. I'm in other channels that would ask and that would distract from this and that's no fun.
22:40 < desertc> hal14450: Do you go to Nick Tahoes?

22:40 < gcleric[NM]> nealmcb[CO]: if you are a member.
22:40 < LaserJock> what's shakin' people?
22:40 < desertc> jcastro: you're a big vista fan aren't you?
22:40 < lamalex[PA]> kdubois: if they can't figure it out, they probably shouldn't be on the computer
22:40 <@atoponce[UT]> LaserJock, welcome

22:40 < [CA]Yasumoto> heya LaserJock

22:49 < kdubois[MI]> vorian: absolutely, where to sign up?
22:49 < ianmcorvidae> but that's rather unlikely :)
22:49 <@atoponce> vorian, is it free?
22:49 <+etank[KY]> which i dont plan on being dead

22:50 <@atoponce> untagetra[UT], just come to meetings and have fun
22:50 < snap-l[MI]> Anyone planning on being at Penguicon (who isn't in MI, because you're all just expected to come. :) )
22:50 <+etank[KY]> atoponce: could be wrong on that part though

22:50 < desertc> vorian: I got lured into helping last year by a troop carrying cake through the Columbus streets.  But you know what?  The cake was a lie!  I hope I get some cake this year.
22:50 <+boredandblogging> untagetra[UT]: help out wherever you can

22:53 <@atoponce> that would depend on who you ask, i guess
22:53 < tritium[NM]> LDwayneS[PA]: :)
22:54 < tritium[NM]> atoponce: like people with engineering degrees
22:54 <@atoponce> being an RHCE examiner, i can tell you that this ain't no MSCE. you're actually proven you can administer a system
22:54 < snap-l[MI]> MCSE = Microsoft Certified Somewhat Enterprisey.
22:54 < desertc> jms1989[LA]: so the poor web designers can stay employed
22:54 <+greg-g[MI]> haha
22:54 < LDwayneS[PA]> atoponce: so..it should be Red Hat Certified Administrator..
22:54 <@atoponce> LDwayneS[PA], there is already an RHCA: red hat certified architect
22:54 < tritium[NM]> heh
22:55 < lamalex[PA]> haha
22:55 <@atoponce> which is literally 5x harder than the RHCE
22:55 < eddieftw> i want to learn RHCA, but im not sure yet

22:55 < tyche> I'd say RHCS, but people would replace sysadmin with a naughty word.
22:55 <+greg-g[MI]> take care untagetra[UT]
22:55 < untagetra[UT]> Thanks greg-g[MI]
22:56 <@atoponce> untagetra[UT], np. see you around

22:56 <+nealmcb>  jcastro 5-a-day looks like a great idea.  I curious why you have to report bugs via the app - can't the stats just be pulled off launchpad?
22:56 <+etank[KY]> LaserJock: how ya been
22:56 < desertc> jms1989[LA]: I know, I run drupal too and it is complex to make changes
22:56 < tritium[NM]> LaserJock: we have a similar problem in NM.
22:56 <+greg-g[MI]> nealmcb: I've thought the same question
22:57 <+greg-g[MI]> nealmcb: specifically from the "view karma log" or whatever page it is
22:57 < LaserJock> atoponce: well ... the mailing list has 2 emails ... ever
22:57 <@atoponce> heh
22:57 < ianmcorvidae> The problem we have is that we have lots of active people who have great ideas but seem to have trouble implementing most of them :)
22:57 < tritium[NM]> We get a lot of offtopic emails on our mailing list.
22:57 < desertc> What do you guys think about organized LPI study groups?
22:58 < ianmcorvidae> We only have our newsletters on our mailing list
22:58 < desertc> Or Ubuntu certs when they come out
22:58 < ianmcorvidae> but IRC is quite active, so
22:58 <@atoponce> vorian, will there be ubuntu certs going on at ohio linux fest?
22:58 < ianmcorvidae> I'd love to do a study session sometime, if just to teach others stuff :)
22:58 <@atoponce> that's really what i want
22:58 < Heartsbane> desertc: works for me
22:58 < vorian> atoponce: yepper
22:58 < LDwayneS[PA]> desertc: I'd be up for a study group!
22:58 <@atoponce> vorian, know the price?
22:59 < ianmcorvidae> is there any sort of guide for Ubuntu cert yet
22:59 < vorian> atoponce: but you have to be LCP 1&2
22:59 < vorian> atoponce: like $100
22:59 < ianmcorvidae> atoponce: 300 for LPI1, 100 additionall for Ubuntu
22:59 <@atoponce> vorian, have to already have them, or just pass them too?
22:59 <+etank[KY]> atoponce: last year i think it was pretty cheap
22:59 < ianmcorvidae> already have them, atoponce
22:59 <@atoponce> meh
22:59 < ianmcorvidae> well, you CAN pass them there too
22:59 < LaserJock> any idea on how to get some spark in Ubuntu NV?
22:59 <@atoponce> ok. that's better
22:59 < ianmcorvidae> either is acceptable, basically
23:00 < LaserJock> my guess is that it just needs a good leader
23:00 <@atoponce> LaserJock, do you have f2f meets?
23:00 < LaserJock> atoponce: nope
23:00 < vorian> Ohio Linux Fest is the awesomest
23:00 <+etank[KY]> atoponce: they offer a training day on friday, conf on saturday, tests on sunday
23:00 <+etank[KY]> vorian: ++
23:00 < ianmcorvidae> face to face does help a lot
23:00 < desertc> LaserJock: do meetups at the Star Trek Casino and the Museum of Nuclear Weapons Testing
23:00 <@atoponce> etank[KY], cool. i should definitely go then, just for that if nothing else
23:00 < vorian> then Penguicon, (right jcastro?)  ;-)
23:01 <@atoponce> LaserJock, sounds like you just need some good meets. maybe hitting up a datacenter or linux cluster for a field trip
23:01 < jcastro> vorian: I love both.
23:01 < vorian> weee
23:01 <+boredandblogging> LaserJock: spam...err...advertise as much as possible
23:01 < LaserJock> hmm
23:01 < snap-l[MI]> Penguicon and Ohio Linux are different shows
23:01 < jcastro> vorian: penguicon is a great weekend. Ohio Linuxfest is a great one-day event.
23:01 < chuckf> LaserJock, here in md the best meets we have a dinner meets
23:01 <@atoponce> LaserJock, yeah. hit up the LUG mailing lists as well
23:01 < tyche> boredandblogging: LOL
23:01 < LaserJock> I need to find somebody to do that ...
23:01 < LaserJock> :-)
23:01 < snap-l[MI]> Ohio Linux is 100% Linux conference
23:02 <@atoponce> heh
23:02 <+etank[KY]> atoponce: yeah, and it would be good to actually meet you too
23:02 < snap-l[MI]> Penguicon is 100% nerdfest.
23:02 < vorian> jcastro: OLF-U sounds to be a bigger event this year
23:02 < jcastro> I think ohiolinux is a better linux show ... but on the otherhand penguicon has things like Tron-guy.
23:02 < jcastro> which is just awesome
23:02 < chuckf> LaserJock, do you have any LUGs you can work with?
23:02 < vorian> tron guy
23:02 < vorian> :)
23:02 < desertc> snap-l[MI]: Notacon is coming up, too
23:02 <+etank[KY]> snap-l[MI]: nerd is a dirty word. use geek instead :)
23:02 < jcastro> yeah, tron guy, hahah

23:02 < vorian> I've seen the pics
23:02 < desertc> geek is defined as an outcast - nerd means brainy!
23:02 < jcastro> vorian: I think they complement each other well, penguicon in the spring, ohio in the fall
23:02 < vorian> and the large viking women
23:02 < LaserJock> chuckf: well, there are 2 and one got mad at me and started a "Ubuntu sucks" flame fest and the other never responded :-)
23:02 < jcastro> good excuses to party
23:03 < vorian> :)
23:03 < snap-l[MI]> Sorry, I aspire to the true meaning of geek, which means I better start practicing biting the heads off of chickens and busking.
23:03 <@atoponce> etank[KY], unfortunately, there's no training in KY for red hat...
23:03 < LaserJock> the one in my area is like 5-10 people and it's not organized at all
23:03 < chuckf> LaserJock, that bites
23:03 < desertc> mmm... chicken
23:03 < vorian> atoponce: what about TN?
23:03 <+etank[KY]> atoponce: there is nothing in KY
23:03 <@atoponce> vorian, nope. none there either
23:03 <+etank[KY]> atoponce: it sucks to be a geek here.

23:04 <+etank[KY]> sontek: that dont count for us geeks though :(
23:04 <+etank[KY]> i dont gamble
23:04 < sontek> etank[KY]: yeah, but horse racing has a large tech industry
23:04 < r2d2rogers[LA]> anyone got advice for trying to help jumpstart neighboring state loco's?
23:04 < r2d2rogers[LA]> I'

23:05 < tyche> etank[KY]: You don't have to gamble.  Just follow the horses. That's gamble enough.  And watch where you step, please.

23:05 <+etank[KY]> jcastro: i am willing to move for a good job
23:05 < r2d2rogers[LA]> vorian: at least AZ is represented here... or ppl might have wondered at my definition of "neighboring"
23:05 < jcastro> etank[KY]: then stay away from michigan, there are no jobs here, heh
23:06 < desertc> LDwayneS[PA]: best limestone caves in the country in Kentucy
23:06 < klb[KY]> huge, they are
23:06 < klb[KY]> some might even call them Mammoth
23:06 < LDwayneS[PA]> desertc: Yup..and one of the best (if not the best) smallmouth lakes in the country too.
23:06 < tyche> r2d2rogers[LA]: WHAT?  We're good neighbors.  We don't shoot outside our state (of course anything inside it is fair game)

23:15 < tritium> LaserJock: that's excellent.
23:15 < LaserJock> tritium: yeah, not a lot of time for Ubuntu
23:15 < desertc> hey, a bit OT, but I went to a Bio Fuel demonstration at Vanderbilt yesterday.  They take the cafeteria's grease, mix glycerin and lye, let it settle, then get fuel for diesel engines and high-quality soap.  I was amazed.  5 gallons of fuel and 1 gallon of soap for about $6 of chemicals
23:16 < tritium> LaserJock: I can completely relate.
23:16 < eddieftw> Vanderbilt?
23:16 < LaserJock> tritium: I became a Debian Maintainer though and am working upstream on a 3D molecular visualization/editing app
23:16 < vorian> TN
23:16 < desertc> They do this to get rid of their 200 gals / week dirty grease that the cafeteria creates.
23:16 < eddieftw> desertc: it's not an issue of technologically complicated issues about eneergy renewal
23:17 < eddieftw> it's the oil lobby
23:17 < tritium> LaserJock: congratulations!  I never had such aspirations.  MOTU was enough for me.  :)
23:17 < desertc> eddieftw: yeah, but you should have tried this soap.  hands. smooth. felt like butter.  :-D
23:17 < tyche> desertc: And smell like french fries
23:18 < desertc> lol! no
23:18 <+nealmcb> ok - here's the python way to count participants by declared state: [(k, len(list(g))) for k, g in itertools.groupby(sorted(re.compile(r'\][^\[]*\[').split(s)))]

23:18 < snap-l[MI]> Mmmm.... fries.
23:18 < tyche> desertc: Fish?
23:19 <+nealmcb> where s is the string from /names with cruft on the beginning and end stripped out...
23:19 <+greg-g[MI]> phish?
23:19 < desertc> and they can't sell the fuel because of regulations, so they give it all away.  they sell the soap for a profit
23:20 < desertc> Hey, so back on the subject of locos -- I held a nerd movie night
23:20 < LaserJock> tritium: heh, well I didn't much either but there are a couple packages I'd like to maintain in Debian
23:20 < desertc> Was a good success!  We watched a movie that was licensed share-alike so people could get copies, if they wanted
23:20 < tritium> Damn, Marquette can't miss their threes now...
23:21 < desertc> There were 10 people who showed up to watch it.  I recommend it to all locos!
23:21 < tritium> LaserJock: :)
23:21 <+nealmcb> desertc: University of Colorado has fueled student busses with cafeteria grease for a few years now iirc
23:21 < LaserJock> tritium: somehow I keep "gaining" things to be doing

23:21 < LaserJock> tritium: but I'm not really getting a lot done :/

23:22 < tritium> LaserJock: ah, then you can relate.  :)
23:22 <+nealmcb> desertc: yeah.  but there isn't a lot of that fuel, so it is only a small part of the "solution"
23:23 <+greg-g[MI]> nealmcb: and will only be cheap until the deep friers of the world start seeing it as an asset/comodity
23:23 < desertc> nealmcb: not enough grease for everyone - no - but it's typically thrown away
23:23 <+nealmcb> right - other good reasons to do it
23:24 < tonyyarusso> oh hey, you folks are still at it
23:24 < desertc> welcome back, tonyyarusso !!

23:37 < vorian> nono

23:38 < lamalex> I have no idea what you guys are saying
23:38 < eddieftw> well, you're better off doing user@ip than user@host because it's easier than setting up a webserver on your computer
23:38 < lamalex> can one of you just say an example line?
23:38 < desertc> neat - I offered to help out - so they signed me up for some work to do there
23:38 < eddieftw> much easier to just enable ssh
23:38 < lamalex> eddieftw: I'm not talking about how to ssh
23:38 < vorian> lamalex: like this
23:38 < lamalex> you can define hosts in .ssh/config
23:38 < vorian> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/59560/
23:39 < lamalex> vorian: thanks
23:39 < vorian> np
23:39 < vorian> (sever should be server)
23:39 < lamalex> not if you want to call it sever :P
23:39 < desertc> peanutb: maybe we can get a bird-of-a-feather room on promoting linux in schools
23:40 < vorian> lamalex: true that
23:40 < vorian> once you get that set up
23:40 < lamalex> which is a pretty badass name
23:40 < vorian> all you have to do is ssh "host"
23:40 < lamalex> yeah
23:40 < vorian> haha
23:40 < H264> hey desertc
23:40 < lamalex> that was my goal, I just couldn't find syntax for that file
23:40 < desertc> H264: Heya!
23:40 < H264> what's up?
23:41 < desertc> H264: I just won a BlackBerry 8300 at a Cisco meetup, where I was angrily thinking about how AT&T was taking over our cellular data airwaves.  But not so angrily that I wouldn't accept their prize.  :)

23:45  * tonyyarusso invites y'all to sunny Minnesota
23:45 < tonyyarusso> well, partly cloudly, but whatever, it's nice this week
23:45 < desertc> lamalex: are you typing the IP addresses when you connect to freenode?
23:45 < eddieftw> if there are any security nuts, in here.. what is the risk of a computer's contents being hijacked via firewire in linux? I know that it's arbitrarily easy for Windows and possible in OSX, but im not sure about linux
23:45 < eddieftw> anyone?
23:45 < lamalex> desertc: huh?
23:45 < lamalex> desertc: I mean my internal dns
23:46 <@atoponce> The_Boat[CA], welcome
23:46 < desertc> anyone else done any interesting loco events recently?
23:46 < desertc> I'm always up for trying new ideas
23:47 <+nealmcb> eddieftw: hmm?  what is the firewire connected to?
23:47 < lamalex> I wanted to have a bikini carwash

23:48 <@atoponce> heh
23:48 <@atoponce> came, thanked me, and went
23:48 <@atoponce> that's nice of him. :)
23:49 < desertc> easy come, easy go?
23:49 <+nealmcb> desertc: props to Jim Hutchinson (musashi)
23:49 < LaserJock> nealmcb: that's cool
23:49 < tyche> Night, all
23:49 <+nealmcb> desertc: one of the presentations includes windows-based FOSS - and any input is welcome

23:53 <+greg-g> yeah, I need some proof here
23:53 < desertc> Oh, yee of little faith.... ;)
23:53 < H264> I can't imagine all software not open
23:53 <+nealmcb> finally - the one I was really looking for:  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TIEColorado08
23:54 < desertc> "The days of proprietary technology must come to an end,"
23:54 < eddieftw> it was on /. as well
23:54 <+greg-g> call me a cynic, but, I'll believe it when I see them actually do it
23:54 -!- tonyyarusso [n=anthony@ubuntu/member/tonyyarusso] has quit ["booting Hardy, maybe"]
23:54 < desertc> eddieftw: Did I reference this after /. got it?  I hate when I do that.
23:54 < H264> ah... so you can't couple software to hardware
23:54 <+nealmcb> eddieftw: you mean windows opens up file sharing over firewire as a network protocol?  or as a hard-disk protocol?
23:54  * nealmcb doubts linux does anything of the kind
23:55 < H264> "We will no longer accept systems that couple hardware, software and data."
23:55 < H264> thats all
23:55 < H264> not necessarly open source
23:55 < desertc> H264: yes, but it is in reference to this DoD mandate: http://www.fcw.com/print/12_27/news/95458-1.html
23:56 < H264> basically making things more modual... and cheaper
23:56 < eddieftw> no it's how firewire was designed
23:56 < eddieftw> to send data both ways without any other software
23:57 < fxef> firewire apears as a network interface in Windows
23:58 < desertc> \d/
23:58 < jms1989[LA]> Really, I've never seen it and I have a firewire port.

00:18 < LaserJock> LTSP has been moved to the Ubuntu Alternate CD and Edubuntu will focus more on educational apps
00:25 < nhaines[CA]> That is a little unfortunate but good for me and the kids I give Edubuntu to.
00:26 < LaserJock> I think it'll be better for everybody
00:26 < LaserJock> LTSP will hopefully get more attention from Ubuntu proper
00:27 < LaserJock> and we can hopefully provide more useful apps for people

00:31 < LaserJock> if you have any suggestions of apps to include let us know :-)

00:47 < nhaines[CA]> jms1989: historical reasons (hysterical raisins?)
00:47 < nhaines[CA]> It's still "back" in Windows.
00:47 < jms1989> It's mapped in windows, but not linux. I'm not sure about Macs.
00:48 < Flannel> Howdy all.  We still doing M-n-G?
00:48 < LaserJock> nealmcb: heh. if it were up to me that'd have been taken care of a long time ago (re: edu LP teams)
00:49 < LaserJock> nealmcb: basically you want to email edubuntu-users for most things
00:49 < nhaines[CA]> Heya, Flannel!
00:50 < [CA]Yasumoto> heya Flannel :)
00:51 < Flannel> Howdy guys

00:52 < Flannel> although, I'll refrain from changing my nick like my cohorts
00:52 < jms1989> nhaines[CA]: so the fix on that webpage should work? How can I map it in about:config?
00:54 < nhaines[CA]> jms1989: Just go to about:config and change the browser.backspace_action key.
00:55 < nhaines[CA]> 0 == go back a page, 1 == scroll up one screenful (opposite of spacebar), 2 == do nothing
00:55 < fxef> jsm1989: backspace key works on my Linux FF

01:05 < nhaines[CA]> jms1989: historically backspace and spacebar scroll the screen on UNIX.  So that's the default there whereas in Windows it follows the IE convention.
01:05 < nhaines[CA]> But I'm glad you were able to change it.  :)  Remember that Alt-left also goes back a page.
01:07 < jms1989> I never knew that, I always use the backspace key in windows to go back a page.

01:23 -!- [MA]yuriy is now known as yuriy
01:27 < jms1989> Then we need to get that key to be defaulted to the backspace key in future versions on Unix and Linux based systems.
01:28 < nhaines[CA]> So that everyone who's used Unix and not Windows can be inconvenienced as well?
01:29 < nhaines[CA]> The better thing to do is to add an option in the Firefox preferences dialog so it can be more readily changed.
01:30 < jms1989> That would work but what about Konquer (or however its spelt)?
01:31 < nhaines[CA]> What does Konqueror do?
01:31 < nhaines[CA]> (for backspace, I mean)
01:32 < jms1989> I don't know, I saw it mentined in that bug report link posted earlier.
01:33 < nhaines[CA]> Oh, right.
01:33 < nhaines[CA]> The point is that you're used to Internet Explorer's behavior, and in Unix nothing works that same way by default.
01:34 < nhaines[CA]> It's not wrong that you want backspace to go back one page.  It's just not the common behavior.  It's not a bug, it's a user preference.
01:34 < nhaines[CA]> Happily, Firefox lets you set that up.  Konqueror might do so as well, I believe.
01:35 < jms1989> I would test it if I had it installed but I don't at the moment. Ubuntu is sleeping right now.
01:37 < jms1989> I'd have to reboot to test it but I'm working on my podcast downloads. I could do it on my old compaq but I'd rather keep the root FS as clean as possible.
01:38 < jms1989> Anyone here want to test Konqueror's backspace key?
01:39 < H264> I know in OSX firefox will use the backspace to go back a page, in Linux it will not...
