==== Translators: you are awesome and you should be proud of it ====

David Planella, Ubuntu Community Team writes about Translations Awesomeness -

As you all know the Meerkat is out.

After the release frenzy, I’d like to take a step back and use the opportunity to thank the people from the part of the community that’s closer to me: translators.

For those not familiar with them, they are a vital piece of the diverse group of individuals that bring Ubuntu to millions: they enable almost everyone to use Ubuntu in their own language. With every release they manage to organize, coordinate and perform the translation effort for the applications that are part of our Operating System.

We’ve got more than 1600 translatable applications for Ubuntu in Launchpad, and believe me, translating even the set of most visible ones is an incredible achievement. Not to forget the effort of upstream translation teams, the work of which is also reflected in Ubuntu.

All in all, the end result is something to be truly proud of.

==== Enabling Automatic Bug Expiry ====

What is about to change? Launchpad has always advertised that we auto-expire incomplete bugs matching certain conditions, but we haven’t done this for awhile now.  We are ready to turn this feature back on.  This means that bugs that are considered inactive will have their status automatically changed from Incomplete to Expired.  For more detail on how Launchpad determines if a bug is inactive,visit our Bug Expiry help page.
This change will take effect in about two weeks, sometime during the week of 18 October 2010.

For more information go to:

http://blog.launchpad.net/general/enabling-automatic-bug-expiry

==== Unity and uTouch ====

One of the most exciting things about the Ubuntu 10.10 release has been the delivery of the Unity ‘shell’ in Ubuntu Netbook Edition, which delivers a very different user experience to that in the main desktop edition. It also features the new Ubuntu Multitouch framework, called uTouch. The Canonical blog shows off some of the new multitouch features and also includes videos.

http://blog.canonical.com/?p=446

==== Multitouch News ====

Duncan Mc``Greggor, Engineering Manager, Product Strategy for Canonical, posted two blog entries with updates on multitouch in Ubuntu this week. The Ubuntu 10.10 release shipped with the new uTouch stack. He writes about how to get involved, posts a video demoing its features and writes about the Qt community and their involvement in the uTouch stack.

==== LoCo Teams on the Hall Of Fame ====

As you may know, during Maverick cycle we introduced statistics from our testers to be reflected in the Ubuntu Hall Of Fame. Well, now, and thanks to my good friend Daniel Holbach, we have, not only individual statistics, but also statistics by Lo``Co team.

==== Logging of Ubuntu LoCo Teams core channels ====

Greetings from the Lo``Co Council, We would like to take a moment and discuss some ideas with you about implementing Lo``Co Bot logging of #ubuntu- channels on freenode. There is a method to this madness, and this would only apply to

The Lo``Co Council have discussed the issue of LoCo-team channel logging with the IRC Council and we've taken advice from Jono Bacon, the Ubuntu Community manager. It was recommended to us that all Lo``Co teams should enable logging
for their main channel, and that we open this up for discussion on this mailing list.

For many Approved teams this is already a standard practice and we thank you for it, but we would like to encourage this practice among the rest of the teams for a couple of good reasons.

==== Slovenian Ubuntu 10.10 Release Party was a Success ====

Firstly, David Klasinc presented the new Ubuntu release in his own unique way, and also gave a presentation on the novelties of Ubuntu Netbook release. He emphasized the e-mail client called Evolution, and the Ubuntu Music Store, which is integrated in the Rhythmbox music player. Especially for the audience, he also demonstrated how to purchase music through the above mentioned service. During his presentation, he also came across a few problems which amused the audience. After that, he also presented cloud service Ubuntu One.

==== Dustin Kirkland: Introducing the Bikeshed Package! ====

Dustin, like many of us, has many scripts used locally to achieve all kinds of things. Some of these tools and utilities may be appropriate for packaging in Ubuntu, but often this never happens. Dustin created a Bikeshed branch in Launchpad where contributors can drop their scripts for wider use or for someone else to package up.

==== Schools Combine Netbooks, Open Source ====

Patricia Mohr writes about - The marriage of netbooks and open source has given schools the power to create and expand 1-to-1 computing.

In the 'Let Learning Goals Lead' section Mohr writes - Dan Maas, the chief information officer for the 15,500-student Littleton public school system in Colorado, started installing Ubuntu-based netbooks in his schools after the district identified student writing as an area it wanted to improve.

==== The Trouble With GUIs ====

Like everything else in life, it boils down to having the right tool for the right job ... and the command line is like that all-purpose screwdriver that we all have," said Slashdot blogger Barbara Hudson. "It opens paint cans, makes a handy chisel, pry bar and wedge -- we grab it, get the job done, and move on.

==== 42 day widget ====

Yesterday [October 10, 2010] we [Canonical Design Team] successfully released the new versions of Ubuntu family. As you all know, yesterday was such a special date which occurs every 100 years: 10/10/10. But if you are a fan of The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, as we are, you would also know that 42 is THE answer. Since 101010 is 42 in binary, and Ubuntu is our 42, we couldn’t help to take this date very seriously.
To celebrate this special event where hopes, people and bits get together, we created a little widget that you can easily embed on your website (more pictures on the way):

==== Planning and Executing the Linaro Cycle ====

The Linaro release cycle is similar to the Ubuntu one but does has some subtle differences, specifically around the planning stages. This presentation shows how Linaro plans, implements and finally releases software every six months. The slides for this presentation can be found on slideshare.net and are available in many formats on my Linaro wiki page.

==== Full Circle Podcast on YouTube ====

In a bold (and some say rash) experiment, the Full Circle Podcast is on You``Tube. We’ve created a You``Tube channel for the Podcast with two episodes. Podcast Episode #11 in individual segments as audio-with-banner, Side-Pod #4 in two parts: Part one is the news/opinion section, part 2 is our first Screencast of sorts
