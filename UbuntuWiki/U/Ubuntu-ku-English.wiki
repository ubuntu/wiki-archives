<nowiki>[[Ubuntu-ku]]</nowiki> is the Kurdish localized version of Ubuntu. The first well localized edition, 6.10 Edgy Eft, was presented in Diyarbakir/Turkey on November 19th, 2006. See a report with photos on <nowiki>[[Ubuntu_in_Diyarbakir]]</nowiki>. The localization was done by the KurdishTeam. 

Unfortunately a criminal prosecution was launched after the event. Some relevant press reports in English can be found here:
