==== Ubuntu Core On The Nexus 7 ====

Jono Bacon writes about plans for the Ubuntu core on Nexus 7 project. Bacon pointed out very clearly: “This is not going to be a tablet Unity interface running on the 8/16GB Nexus 7, but instead will focus on getting the current Ubuntu Desktop running on the Nexus so that we can ensure pieces such as the kernel, power management and other related areas are working effectively on a tablet device.”

Along with the project description, Bacon provides information for potential project contributors (testers and developers) and points out the UDS-R session schedule for getting Ubuntu core on Nexus 7.

==== Samsung's ARM-powered Chromebook runs Ubuntu ====

Trent Nouveau of TG Daily shares how Olof Johansson managed to load up Ubuntu on a $249 laptop before Samsung’s Chromebook has been officially shipped. Nouveau highlights that person “doesn’t have to replace Chrome as an OS to run Ubuntu, but rather, the Linux variant can be written to an SD card, while the Chromebook is booted from a removable storage card.” Still, there is a caution from Johansson that if a person doesn’t know what is she doing it is better to wait for refined instructions.

John Breeden II of GCN highlights changes to desktop, server and cloud in Ubuntu 12.10. Breeden states: “I’ve always thought that Ubuntu was one of the cleanest flavors of Linux, but it wasn’t always the most cutting-edge. The release of Ubuntu 12.10 and Ubuntu Server 12.10 could change that, adding more Internet capabilities to the desktop and more cloud optimization to the server side.” Breeden then reflects on comments from Canonical CEO Jane Silber that that the new desktop version of Ubuntu is a good alternative to Microsoft Windows 8.
