==== Jono Bacon on UDS ====

December 8th through the 12th, is the Ubuntu Developer Summit (UDS)[1].  This event, for 200 of Ubuntu's finest, and others who wish to attend,  is for the purpose of designing, discussing and planning Jaunty Jackalope, Ubuntu 9.04.  Five days of sessions spread across seven tracks, focusing on different elements of the Ubuntu platform and community.  Also, as a part of UDS, Jono will be heading the Community Track that will include all sorts of issues, including governance, process, initiative, collaboration and participation and much, much more.  Another aspect of UDS is community.  Along with the hard work is the time to play - to greet old friends and make new ones, and come down off the physically draining aspect of the Summit.  Jono invites everyone to attend.

=== LoCo News ===

==== Tamil Team - Intrepid Introduced at Udhagamandalam ====
Udagamandalam, Nov 28. Computer World of Udagamandalam(1) (a.k.a Ooty), hosted Intrepid Ibex release event at Lawly Institute. Wide range of people ranging form School Teachers, Students, Computer Vendors, Government Officials took part in the event.

Variety of topics starting from different modes of Installing Ubuntu, Package Management, Administration, Tamil features were discussed & demonstrated.

Special Thanks to Terrance S Rajesh of Computer World for making arrangements for event despite heavy rains across the week. Sri Ramadoss & Padmanathan of Ubuntu Tamil Team conducted the event.

==== Ubuntu Zimbabwe ====

Below is a report submitted from the ICT Director of the Parliament of Zimbabwe on his presentation given at the e-Parliament Conference in Brussels. The Parliament of Zimbabwe has chosen to use Ubuntu on their desktops, and possibly on their servers too. The ICT Director is also a member of the Ubuntu Zimbabwe Lo``Co Team.

The Global Centre for ICT in Parliament already knew that the Parliament of Zimbabwe was advocating Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) in automating its processes. As a result they requested that I do a presentation outlining the business case for the migration to FOSS. Two other parliaments have also opted to use FOSS for their operations, namely Italy and France, and my presentation followed immediately after that of France.

The final Power``Point presentation is available on request.

A number of African parliaments showed interests in the presentation including Ghana, South Africa, Malawi and Tanzania.

The following questions were asked among other issues that were discussed:

     1. Challenges in migrating calendars (MS Outlook as well as those created using other proprietary software). Parliament of Zimbabwe argued that migrating in general is not a major constraint since there were no shared calendars in use. Parliament will have to use the calendaring system built into the FOSS.

     2. Challenges importing documents done by very old versions of MS Word and MS Excel especially those with nested tables and multiple formulae. Most documents in Parliament are not complex and can be easily and comfortably migrated.

     3. Italy presented that cost cutting should not necessarily be the biggest motivation for migration because major savings cannot be realised in the short term but probably in the long term. This raised the question of affordability in that those countries with good budgets can afford the licensing and purchase of proprietary software where as those with skinny budgets (such as most African countries) tend to have other priorities (hunger relief, HIV/AIDS interventions, Health, etc) and the purchase and licensing of software is usually sidelined. Parliaments in such countries, therefore, will pirate software. The Parliament of Zimbabwe weighed the risk of pirating against the few issues that could be raised against FOSS and decided to go the FOSS route.

     4. Challenges relating to training/re-training Officers of Parliament and Members of Parliament in the use of the FOSS. Parliament submitted that there is a huge difference in the appearance of Office 2007 and earlier versions of Office in such that Parliaments that opt to migrate to Office 2007 will certainly have to re-train. By comparison, the appearance of Open``Office is not too different from earlier versions of Office to the extent that it might be easier training for Open``Office than for Office 2007. Having said that, Parliament of Zimbabwe has the added advantage of having just come out of general elections meaning most of the Members of Parliament are new and will require training. Their training will, therefore, include ICT training. The Officers will also be trained along with the Members of Parliament.

In the end, it was realized that FOSS is the way to go for Parliaments in countries that operate on thin budgets. Given that there is a lot of community support and certainly a FOSS equivalent for most desktop applications, most African countries should consider FOSS for their desktops.

=== In The Press ===

* IBM pushes "Microsoft alternative" desktop - Based on Ubuntu Linux, virtualization technology from Virtual Bridges and its own Lotus Applications IBM created a desktop that should become an alternative to Microsoft. Usage of Virtual Bridge's VERDE (Virtual Enterprise Remote Desktop Environment) is said to make this solution more cost-efficient than Using Microsoft Office on Microsoft Windows Desktops. http://www.desktoplinux.com/news/NS3460383523.html

* IBM, Ubuntu Unveil Microsoft-Free 'PC' - This is a combination of an Ubuntu desktop combined with IBM Lotus applications delivered through a Linux virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) from Virtual Bridges.  The applications, themselves, come from the Open Collaboration Client Solution (OCCS) software. Rather than purely open source, this is an open standards solution.  It is a paradigm solution, rather than a direct product to product competition, because IBM is challenging the perception that a desktop is a machine on your desk running Windows. http://www.internetnews.com/software/article.php/3788981/IBM+Ubuntu+Unveil+MicrosoftFree+PC.htm

* Ubuntu Remains Best Linux Distribution for Desktops - Jason Brooks examined Ubuntu 8.10 as a desktop and felt that, even though Red Hat and Fedora may have more users, Ubuntu is the better desktop due to its concentration on usability.  He defines usability as being Ubuntu's large selection of ready-to-install software, large community of users and contributors and its broad support of hardware components.  He does feel, however, that Ubuntu lacks the latest security features in the server department that are the hallmark of such as Red Hat and Fedora.  http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Linux-and-Open-Source/Ubuntu-Remains-Best-Linux-Distribution-for-Desktops/

* Microsoft Should Worry Less About Live, More About Linux - It is Ed Moltzen's opinion that, with its concentration on search and advertising space, Microsoft has left the field open for Ubuntu to take over the desktop.  He feels that the improvements to Vista have largely been surpassed by Ubuntu and, in this economic climate of recession in the U.S., Ubuntu has been given a chance to make a dent in Microsoft's desktop OS business.  Ubuntu is free to download, easy to install, has high performance numbers, and is easy enough for kids to use. http://www.crn.com/software/212201323

* Why Ubuntu Now Beats Vista - Channel``Web literally looks at both Vista and Ubuntu with a series of slides and descriptions of critical comparisons.  This comparison clearly points out how Ubuntu has caught up to or, in many cases, surpassed Vista.  Some of the points they emphasized are wifi connection, the guest session, multimedia support, lower hardware requirements and cost.  http://www.crn.com/software/212201252;jsessionid=T4YWJV4HS24WSQSNDLPCKH0CJUNN2JVN?pgno=1

* Studio``Dave Does A Hardware Review And Meets Ubuntu 8.10 - Dave Phillips was faced with the deterioration of his HP Omnibook due to age, and set out to replace it with a laptop that would be able to handle his audio needs.  This meant getting a machine that could handle his specific needs, like AVSynthesis, Csound 5.09, Ardour 3, JACK, and the latest Java SDK.  This is not the sort of installation that the ordinary user would face, but he was satisfied with the results that Ubuntu gave him.  In particular, the apt system that make it easy to update the system to the real time kernel and the full-featured development environment.  http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/studiodave-does-hardware-review-and-meets-ubuntu-810

=== In The Blogosphere ===

* IBM launches Ubuntu-based VDI solution - Brian Madden acknowledges, in this post, that he's not really familiar with or comfortable with Linux.  With that as a basis, and the apparent lack of information on the virtualization that IBM is using, he sees no point in the offering.  It is his opinion that regardless of the platform, it will still have to run Windows applications.  In his words, "Maybe in another five or ten years when we're all running Rich Internet Apps in the cloud, but for now, we live in a Windows world".  http://www.brianmadden.com/blogs/brianmadden/archive/2008/12/05/ibm-launches-ubuntu-based-vdi-solution.aspx

* IBM, Canonical Declare Ubuntu Linux War Against Windows, Office - Joe Panettieri makes the prediction that "the Windows-Office duopoly will fall within the next three to five years."  This statement is based on the cooperation of IBM, Virtual Bridges and Canonical in their latest offering.  He quotes the IBM press release with saying, "This solution runs open standards-based email, word processing, spreadsheets, unified communication, social networking and other software to any laptop, browser, or mobile device from a virtual desktop login on a Linux-based server configuration."   http://www.workswithu.com/2008/12/04/ibm-canonical-declair-ubuntu-war-against-windows-office/

=== In Other News ===

==== Ubuntu Podcast #14 ====

 http://ubuntupodcast.net/2008/12/06/ubuntu-podcast-episode-14/

==== Vibuntu 1.0 ====
Vibuntu is another Ubuntu derivative that is based on Ubuntu 8.10 and targeted for visually impaired users. Therefore it logs on automatically and has Orca enabled by default. Applications that are not or rarely used by blind and otherwise visually impaired people, such as GIMP or F-Spot, have been removed.

==== Lazy Linux: 10 essential tricks for admins ====
Ever got your DVD-Rom locked by someone else? Harassed your console? Or even forgot the root password (Well, maybe not on Ubuntu)? IBM Developer``Works has some tricks for you to deal which such annoyances next time.
http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-10sysadtips/index.html

==== Ilumina TV runs on Ubuntu ====

Jerome Gotangco took a look at Ilumina TV, a prototype unveiled by a local start-up in the Philippines called Inovent Inc. One thing he noticed is that it's supposed to be running on a stripped down version of Ubuntu. Other than that, it looks like any other Personal Video Recorder (PVR), such as MythTV or Elisa, with a different front end. He hasn't had the ability to actually see the prototype in action, yet, only some pictures and slides on the company blog site. He hopes to get a sneak peak in the near future. http://engage.wordpress.com/2008/12/06/ilumina-tv-runs-on-ubuntu/

==== George Wright responds to backstage questions(Video) ====

Backstage Blog asked George Wright, Portfolio Manager at Research and Innovation, some questions about the efforts of the BBC, and Ubuntu 8.10, to make a range of non-DRM protected content available. Mr. Wright's answers appear to be somewhat terse, and aimed mainly at individuals, but they go a long way to explain where the plugin is now developmentally, and where it is headed.  One of the biggest problems that the BBC has is negotiating the rights to offer content outside the United Kingdom. Added to this problem is the necessity of individualizing the release of content per the location in which it is viewed. He will also be blogging about this and other things they're working on for the BBC Internet Blog. Video links to the interview are available at the link. http://backstage.bbc.co.uk/news/archives/2008/11/george_wright_r.html
