==== Ian Weisser: Are you ready for new members? ====

Ian Weisser shows us the Find-a-Task tool (http://community.ubuntu.com/contribute/find-a-task/) introduced last year for new contributors to find tasks to work on in Ubuntu. He points out that more people may be inclined to contribute if they received Ubuntu devices for the holidays. Finally, he explains how teams can contribute their own tasks and encourages suggestions to improve Find-a-Task be shared on the Ubuntu Community Team mailing list.

http://cheesehead-techblog.blogspot.com/2015/12/are-you-ready-for-new-members.html

==== Daniel Holbach: The world of Snappy at UbuCon Summit ====

Daniel Holbach shares his excitement over the upcoming Ubu``Con Summit in Pasadena, California in January of 2016, writing “I look forward to meeting everyone and particularly look forward to what we’ve got to show in terms of Snappy Ubuntu Core.” He goes on to outline a couple of Snappy specific sessions: Internet of Things gets ‘snappy’ with Ubuntu Core, and the Hands-on demo: creating Ubuntu snaps with Snapcraft.

==== Kevin DuBois: New Mir Release (0.18) ====

Kevin Du``Bois announces the release of Mir 0.18 and links to the full changelog of the release before diving into some of the highlights around graphics, input and bug fixing. He concludes with some speculation as to what is coming next for Mir, including "various Internet-o-Things and convergence topics" and "more flexible screenshotting support."

http://kdubois.net/?p=2032

==== Dustin Kirkland: More people use Ubuntu than anyone actually knows ====

Dustin Kirkland responds to criticism about the number of systems and users that Ubuntu currently has. Since Ubuntu does not require registration of installations like other operating systems, he dives into various numbers they do have, from downloads of various containers, to cloud deployments and various Internet of Things uses. He also cites various companies (including Netflix, Paypal, Dropbox, Snapchat, Pinterest and Reddit.) whose platforms are running on Ubuntu, arguably bringing the number of “users” much higher. He concludes "More people use Ubuntu than anyone actually knows. Because of who we all are."

http://blog.dustinkirkland.com/2015/12/more-people-use-ubuntu-than-anyone.html

Dustin’s post is a response to the Phoronix article “It Doesn't Look Like Ubuntu Reached Its Goal Of 200 Million Users This Year”: https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Ubuntu-No-200-Million-Users and Softpedia continues the discussion with “There Are Probably More than 1 Billion Ubuntu Users, .Canonical Lead Explains”:  http://news.softpedia.com/news/there-are-probably-more-than-1-billion-ubuntu-users-canonical-lead-explains-498035.shtml

==== Julian Andres Klode: Much faster incremental apt updates ====

Julian Andres Klode reports that the addition of read buffering to the application of the pdiff format that apt uses results in a tenfold increase in the speed of apt-get update. Other potential areas of improvement include write buffering and different compression methods.

https://juliank.wordpress.com/2015/12/26/much-faster-incremental-apt-updates/

Julian continues with a post titled "APT 1.1.8 to 1.1.10 – going 'faster'" https://juliank.wordpress.com/2015/12/30/apt-1-1-8-to-1-1-10-going-faster/

==== Paul White: My Ubuntu year - 2015 ====

Paul White looks back through on 2015 to share the various projects he worked on and things accomplished in the Ubuntu community. Highlights include applying for and becoming an Ubuntu Member, testing Xubuntu and Ubuntu GNOME, a term as a moderator on ubuntuforums.org and various contributions to the Ubuntu Weekly Newsletter. He also reflects on his switch from Kubuntu and takes the opportunity to encourage others to participate in the Ubuntu Weekly Newsletter.

* Juju Charmer Summit: Docker Lightning Talk - https://insights.ubuntu.com/2015/12/22/juju-charmer-summit-docker-lightning-talk/

=== In The Blogosphere ===

==== Ubuntu aims for true convergence across devices in 2016 ====

Paul Hill of Neowin predicts that Canonical may achieve its convergence goal across all devices in 2016 after seeing an image on Google+ which included the message "The same Ubuntu experience across any device - coming soon". He embeds a short video entitled “Convergence in action” in his post and reminds us that convergence requires Unity 8 which will be an option for advanced users to select at the log-in screen of Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

http://www.neowin.net/news/ubuntu-aims-for-true-convergence-across-devices-in-2016

==== Aethercast Developing Open Source Display Streaming for Ubuntu ====

Christopher Tozzi, The VAR Guy, takes a quick look at Aethercast, Miracast and data streaming. He predicts that streaming video to monitors and TVs from Ubuntu mobile devices via Miracast will blur the lines between the GNU/Linux experience (Ubuntu) and proprietary operating systems. Christopher adds that it will also help to advance Ubuntu “convergence”, Canonical’s primary focus for several years.

==== Dedicated GPS Navigation Scope Coming to Ubuntu Touch ====

Silviu Stahie of Softpedia writes that the developer of uNav GPS Navigation is looking into the possibility of building a dedicated scope for Ubuntu Touch. He says that for now it’s just a concept, that would be based on Open``Street``Map. Silviu expects to see more information about the new scope soon.

http://news.softpedia.com/news/dedicated-gps-navigation-scope-coming-to-ubuntu-touch-498128.shtml

==== ZFS File System for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS Is 90% Ready ====

Silviu Stahie of Softpedia writes that the ZFS file system will be available in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS but only as a tech preview as it is not yet fully integrated into Ubuntu. He quotes Canonical’s Chad Miller as saying that there is currently no support in the Ubiquity installer for ZFS but that using a temporary PPA an install using ZFS can be made.

==== System76 Oryx Pro is the Ubuntu Linux gaming laptop of your dreams [Review] ====

Brian Fagioli of Betanews reviews the System76 Oryx Pro gaming laptop which ships with Ubuntu 15.10. He quotes an example configuration, priced at $2,317, shows us several photographs that confirm an impressive number of ports, and describes the 15.6 inch 1080p display as “absolutely gorgeous.” In his summary Brian says: “It is undoubtedly one of my favorite laptops ever.”
