| <rowbgcolor="#d9bb7a">Application
| How to see the problem
| Has a .desktop file?
| Has an executable?
| How to fix
|-
| Bluetooth Wizard
| Execute bluetooth-wizard. Icon is fuzzy and the launcher obtained by pinning does not work.
| No
| Yes, bluetooth-wizard
| Simply creating .desktop file pointing to the executable seems to work
|-
| Send via Bluetooth
| Execute bluetooth-sendto. Icon is fuzzy and the launcher obtained by pinning does not work.
| No
| Yes, bluetooth-sendto
| Simply creating .desktop file pointing to the executable seems to work
|-
| Evolution Backup
| Execute the backup wizard in Evolution. Icon is fuzzy and the launcher obtained by pinning does not work.
| No
| The closest thing is /usr/lib/evolution/<version>/evolution-backup
| Creating a .desktop file pointing to /usr/lib/evolution/<version>/evolution-backup works to fix the icon, but the launcher doesn't make sense because it cannot be launched as a standalone app
|-
| Policykit
| Open anything that requires authorization, for example adjusting Date & Time. Icon is fuzzy and the launcher obtained by pinning does not work.
| Yes, /etc/xdg/autostart/polkit-gnome-authentication-agent-1.desktop
| The closest thing is /usr/lib/policykit-1-gnome/polkit-gnome-authentication-agent-1
| Copying the .desktop to /usr/share/applications works to fix the icon, but the launcher doesn't make sense because it cannot be launched as a standalone app
|-
| pango-view
| Open pango-view with any document as the argument. Goes completely insane: opens two icons, each one indicating three instances, and with no icon
| No
| Yes, pango-view
| ?
|-
| Create a launcher
| Right-click on the desktop and choose "create a launcher". Icon is fuzzy. I'm not sure if the launcher does not work or it simply fails silently because it requires a parameter.
| No
| Yes, gnome-desktop-item-edit
| Creating a .desktop file pointing to gnome-desktop-item-edit seems to fix the icon, but the pinned launcher won't work.
|-
| Network Manager
| Click on the network indicator and choose "connection indicator" or "about". Icons are fuzzy and pinned launchers do not work.
| Yes, but for the applet and not to open directly those windows
| Yes, but for the applet and not to open directly those windows
| ?
|-
| Abiword
| Install Abiword, right click on a document file, select "open with", enter the command "abiword", double click the file
| No idea
| Yes, abiword
