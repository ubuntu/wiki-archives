==== Ubuntu Community Council Elections 2009 ====

The 2009 Community Council is up for election, and all members of Ubuntu are entitled to vote. The nominees for this round are below, together with links to their wiki pages which document their interests, experience, skills and goals.

The Council is responsible for community governance. They are the ultimate arbiter of community disputes, and they nominate candidates for leadership in key positions across the entire project. In selecting your candidates, please consider their ability to act in an independent fashion and exercise good judgement of character, values and tone. We have an enormous community now that spans many different media, regions, technologies and interests. The CC cannot include a representative of every constituency, so members of the CC need to be able to represent the interests of many different groups.

We are electing 7 members. Our amazing candidates are:

* James Troup: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/JamesTroup
* Paul Sladen: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/PaulSladen
* Christophe Sauthier: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/ChristopheSauthier
* Alan Pope: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/AlanPope
* Elizabeth Krumbach: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/lyz
* Richard Johnson: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/RichardJohnson
* Daniel Holbach: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/DanielHolbach
* Benjamin Mako Hill: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BenjaminMakoHill
* Emmet Hikory: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/EmmetHikory
* Nathan Handler: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/nhandler
* Matthew East: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/MatthewEast
* Mike Basinger: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/MikeBasinger

Thank you for taking the time to participate in this election! The winning candidates will form the core of the CC for two years. We may have other votes to add candidates during that time if we need to expand the CC, but it’s likely that this will be the primary team for 2009-2011.

==== New LoCo Council Member Sought ====

A little while ago Nick Ali stepped down from the Lo``Co Council. We were of course very sad to see this happen, and would like to thank Nick for his great work on the Council. However, we are now down one person, and need to find a new member. I’m writing this mail to ask for volunteers to step forward and nominate themselves or another willing person for this position. There is only one position available, so if more than one person steps forward, there will be a vote to decide on the successful candidate.

The Lo``Co Council is defined on the wiki. We meet up once a month over IRC to go through items on the team agenda. This typically involves approving new Lo``Co teams, resolving issues within teams, approving Lo``Co team mailing list requests, and anything else that comes along.

* wiki: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LoCoCouncil
* team agenda: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LoCoCouncilAgenda

The process by which a new member of the Council is selected is defined by the Community Council is outlined on the wiki. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommunityCouncil/Delegation

The first stage is for people to nominate themselves, or be nominated by someone else. We will confirm with each person whether they actually want to be put forward or not. We will give ~2 weeks for this process. Please pass this mail back to your own Lo``Co team so everyone is aware of the process. We welcome nominations from anywhere in the world, and from any Lo``Co team. Nominees do not need to be a Lo``Co Team Leader to be nominated for this post. We are however looking for people who are active in their Lo``Co Team.

Please send nominations to loco-council at lists.ubuntu.com which is a private mailing list only for the Lo``Co Council members.

The above mailing list is moderated, however all nomination mails will be approved before the end of the nomination period

If you’d like to ask any of the Lo``Co Council members questions privately then you contact us individually or use the above mailing list address. https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-lococouncil/+members

The nomination process starts now, and ends at 00:01 UTC on 7th October 2009.

Once this period is over the Lo``Co Council will collate the nominations and double check that each person nominated is still happy to stand. We will then pass this list to the CC as per the process.

==== Ubuntu California is Approved LoCo ====

Tuesday the 22nd, the Lo``Co Council had a meeting where the California Team became recognized as an approved Lo``Co team! The California Team has been very active for a few years, when pleia2 spoke with team contact Neal Bussett following the meeting to ask why it took so long to apply, his response was a modest "Because we're overachievers and didn't feel we were really ready to be approved until this year." They did an excellent job with their approval application too, a shining example of what other teams should be striving for.

* Team application: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CaliforniaTeam/ApprovalApplication

Well done California! Congratulations!

==== Mark Shuttleworth: Don't give up the Linux Desktop ====

There are some people who do not believe that the Linux desktop will ever be a major force in the global IT market. Mark Shuttleworth isn't one of them.

Speaking at the Linux``Con conference late Wednesday, the Canonical founder pitched his approach for expanding Linux to provide a better user experience and broadening its appeal. The approach involves having a degree of cadence and coordination between projects and distributions, as well as improving quality and design.

"We definitely shouldn't give up the desktop," Shuttleworth said. "This is one of the most exciting years for the desktop in living memory."

The Intel-led Moblin effort and Google's mobile Linux initiatives with Android and ChromeOS have generated considerable interest in Linux. Canonical-backed Ubuntu, for its part, has a Moblin-based netbook remix. While the interest is there, Shuttleworth noted that some key areas need to be improved about the way Linux is developed and presented to users.

From a user-experience perspective, for instance, he said that Linux's design has been lacking. To that end, Shuttleworth noted that Ubuntu has its own user-experience team that conducts testing with regular people to see how they use software. But Shuttleworth would like to see the user-experience effort extend beyond Ubuntu. During his keynote, he extended an invitation to any open source application to submit their software for testing by user-experience experts. The sessions would be recorded for posterity, and the developer would not be able to interact with the user.

Shuttleworth noted that there traditionally has been some tension in software development between user interface (UI) people and developers, which is a big problem. "If we can't figure out how to bring these two communities together in a powerful way, I don't think we'll achieve the dream," Shuttleworth said. "If we can't make design cool in free software we won't take first prize."

Another issue facing Linux distributions is the absence of any large-scale coordination between many of the underlying open source applications when it comes to releases. In Shuttleworth's view, distributions do not actually compete with each other based on which version of an application they are shipping.

"Every time we create friction and differences between distros on that basis, we're just making life harder for users, and making it harder for upstreams," he said.

The problem for upstream projects has to do with maintenance for multiple versions. If different distributions are using different versions of a particular project, it compounds the number of versions that an upstream project could need to fix and maintain. Shuttleworth's suggestion is to build some kind of consensus among projects around major versions that come out at regular, predictable intervals.

"This doesn't lead to a world where there is no innovation and there is no differentiation," he said. "It just leads to a world where at a developer level you can actually have more effective collaboration."

Ubuntu's collaboration with the Debian Linux distribution is also something that Shuttleworth is keen on continuing to improve. Ubuntu is based in part on code derived from Debian. Shuttleworth noted that most of the core developers in Ubuntu started out as Debian developers.

While Ubuntu's relationship with Debian has not always been perfect, Shuttleworth said that it's better to focus on what can be done to move Linux forward. In his view, the tone of the conversations is up to the leadership of each project.

==== Ubuntu New Mexico team helps the Endorphine Power Company ====

It all began in October 2007, and the players are the New Mexico Loco Team and the Endorphine Power Company. The Endorphin Power Company, or EPC in short, is a non-profit organization “dedicated to improving the lives of people, with special focus on the substance-dependent and homeless, thus alleviating many of the challenges faced by current emergency medical systems. Additional purposes are the promotion of mental and physical health through exercise, energy consciousness and volunteerism.”

With little more than an idea to help others, the New Mexico team approached a local bank asking for donations of computing equipment to help local non-profit organization.
Working as a true team, the New Mexico folks set up a page for the project in the Ubuntu wiki, defining milestones and getting organized through their mailing list.

Fast forward 2009: a functional Ubuntu network at EPC, wi-fi, a wealth of side-projects, ideas for other initiatives, regular updates on the project, negotiation of a support and training agreement, and the satisfaction of doing a good job while having fun and helping others.

This really is an example of what we are and what we can do as a community sharing the Ubuntu spirit. It is more than the operating system we use, promote and support. It is the ethos we share, what moves us to get involved and help other people in real-world projects to make the world a better place.

==== Ubuntu Florida: Preparing for the Global Jam! ====

This past Tuesday evening, at the Florida team meeting we all discussed a couple of key areas that we have planned to attack during the Global Jam. So here they are in a Nutshell: We are planning to do some serious Florida Team Wiki overhauls and streamlining headed up by Chaynie. We are also planning to do a Presentation Jam so that we can generate some usable presentations that we plan on sharing up on Spread Ubuntu. We plan on trying to coordinate things to work with each other both in IRC @ #ubuntu-us-fl and in person if at all possible. As a team we have agreed that these goals are very important areas for us to concentrate on and are looking forward to the Challenge.

==== Kenneth Wimer: Ubuntu Karmic Desktop ====

September 24th was a big day for the Karmic desktop. Lots of pieces came together like switching icon themes, colour changes in the UI, a new dark theme for GDM, a new default background and, 19 photos chosen from the flickr group we started earlier this year. The results of the flickr submissions is simply amazing. 639 members submitted 2001 photos. Selecting the images to include in Karmic was a big task, and if there were more free space on the disk, I would add more. Anyone and everyone who took part in this deserves a big round of applause, and perhaps a beer from me.

==== Neil Jagdish Patel: Ubuntu Netbook Remix Karmic ====

As Karmic hit beta freeze this week, and the artwork began to freeze, I thought it would be a good time to introduce the latest version of Ubuntu Netbook Remix (UNR). As you can probably tell, the largest change from the previous version is a new design and layout. This is thanks to the awesome work of the design team. In addition to the new UI, there has been a fair amount of work in the architecture of the various UNR components. Apart from the users, the largest beneficiaries of this are the launcher and window-picker-applet. Screenshots at the link.

==== Dell and Ubuntu sign up to Intel’s Moblin OS ====

Dell and Ubuntu have publicly embraced Moblin, Intel’s Linux OS designed for mobile devices. The announcements came at IDF in San Francisco, the day after Intel showcased its new version of Moblin for mobile internet devices. Mark Shuttleworth, founder of the Ubuntu project, joined Intel software VP Renee James on stage to introduce the “Ubuntu Moblin Remix”, a new Ubuntu distribution based on the Moblin core. “Moblin keeps on getting more exciting as a project with new applications and improved user experiences,” he declared. John Thode, Dell's vice president of small screen devices, announced that as of today the Mini 10v netbook – already offered with a standard Ubuntu distribution - would also be available with Ubuntu Moblin Remix pre-installed.

==== IBM launches Ubuntu-based distro in Africa ====

IBM and Canonical are introducing an Ubuntu Linux-based distribution and related cloud services for netbooks and thin clients in Africa. According to IBM, netbook sales are strong in Africa, and it cites a study by AIB Research, stating that netbook sales are expected to quadruple from 35 million in 2009 to 139 million by 2013. The study also projected that Linux will outgrow Windows on netbooks by 2012. Stated Mark Shuttleworth, founder, Canonical, "Starting with Africa, we see that this smart client package can help realize our vision of eliminating barriers to computer access for emerging markets."

==== Ubuntu 9.10 boot optimizations: 5 second startup with an SSD ====

The latest Ubuntu 9.10 alpha release includes significant improvements to boot performance. Tests show that the popular Linux distribution can now boot in mere seconds on a computer with a solid state drive. Earlier this year, Canonical revealed plans to significantly optimize boot performance. It aims to deliver 10-second startups for the Ubuntu 10.04 release, which is due in 2010. In the latest Karmic alpha, the team has already taken some important steps toward achieving this goal. Their roadmap indicates that 25 seconds is the target for Karmic, and the reference device used to benchmark progress is the Dell Mini 9 netbook. Users with solid state drives will see a far more dramatic improvement in boot performance. Canonical external developer relations coordinator Jorge Castro (a former Ars Linux contributor) supplied us with a boot chart from his computer, which has an SSD and boots Karmic alpha 6 in only five seconds.

==== Ubuntu 9.10's New Wallpapers and More ====

On October 1st, they will unveil Ubuntu 9.10 (Karmic Koala) Beta and we bet everybody is wondering if Canonical will actually change the user interface (read: skin it) with a breathtaking one. The truth is that we have no idea if they will come with that professional-looking theme everyone was expecting since Jaunty, or they will just offer enough possibilities for users to create their own personalized desktops. What we know at this moment is that there is a very nice splash screen that greets users before the login screen and/or desktop appears, and, starting with today's daily build, Ubuntu 9.10 has 9 wallpapers with planets and stars. Another interesting item that was added today is the new Usplash theme, with Mat Tomaszewski's new logos. That's not all... with the newly released GNOME 2.28.0 desktop environment, users now have access to a lot of themes, wallpapers and icons with a single mouse click. See screenshots and what other features Softpedia reported, visit the link.

==== Ubuntu 9.10 Netbook Remix Is Looking Great ====

This year when the Moblin V2 user-interface was finally unveiled it put us in awe with its sleek, intuitive design that was driven by Clutter. How has Canonical responded to Intel and Moblin V2? Well, there is Ubuntu Moblin Netbook Remix that just debuted to deliver the best of Ubuntu and Moblin, but the traditional Ubuntu Netbook Remix has also picked up several improvements for its 9.10 release. New artwork, including new login and boot screens, were committed to Ubuntu Karmic Koala this week and the other distributions within the Ubuntu family, Netbook Remix included. Ubuntu 9.10 Netbook Remix is using the Clutter 1.0 tool-kit with its launcher to provide nice animations similar to Moblin V2. The window picker applet found in Ubuntu 9.10 Netbook Remix has also picked up new icons and other improvements. One underlying improvement that will really help those Intel Atom netbook users with Ubuntu 9.10 / Ubuntu 9.10 Netbook Remix is the updated Intel Linux graphics stack. Screenshots are available at the link below.

==== Will Ubuntu 9.10 work on your computer? ====

It’s the question thousands of users will surely ask when Canonical debuts Ubuntu 9.10 in October: “Will Ubuntu 9.10 work on my PC?” Canonical has developed testing software to help you determine if your system will fully support the new Ubuntu. During the Atlanta Linux Fest held Sept. 19, Canonical and Ubuntu volunteers used a USB thumb drive — equipped with diagnostics software — to help attendees determine if Ubuntu 9.10 can fully run on their systems. Canonical is gathering all of the diagnostics test results to fix potential bugs and address as many potential user issues as possible. Also, the diagnostics software eliminates the potential pain of installing an operating system only to discover it doesn’t really work with your hardware. Kudos to Canonical for the pro-active testing approach.

==== Women and Ubuntu ====

Carla Schroder of Linux Today published an essay recently dealing with the low level of female participation in open-source projects.  Although the article doesn’t deal with Ubuntu in particular, it nonetheless prompted some thoughts about the role of women in the world’s most popular Linux distribution. The near-absence of women from free-software development is not news.  It’s been a clear problem for a long time, with a wide range of explanations and suggestions offered. Ubuntu has yet to suffer a major gender-relations issue of the order of, for example, the Con``Fusion fiasco in 2008.

The lack of participation by women in Ubuntu may simply reflect women’s under-representation within the free-software world in general.  But given Ubuntu’s goal of becoming “Linux for human beings,” rather than merely another Linux for geeks, the project would do well to attract more females to its lists of developers and users.
How to achieve that goal is a pretty complex question, and I’m not qualified to give a good answer. A blog post by Elizabeth Krumbach of Ubuntu Women offers some good suggestions: http://princessleia.com/journal/?p=1489

==== Thoughts on Ubuntu One ====

Christopher Tozzi has spent the last few weeks testing Ubuntu One, Canonical’s file-storing and sharing service. For a service that remains in beta, Ubuntu One works exceptionally well.  Its strongest points include: easy installation, and the service has worked great. Unfortunately, Ubuntu One also currently has some glaring problems, namely: only Ubuntu 9.04 and later are supported, no cross-platform support, and Ubuntu One code is not open source. Ubuntu One could go far, and maybe even provide Canonical with another much-needed revenue stream, or it could founder as a result of its lack of cross-platform support.
