==== Alan Pope: Ubuntu Artful Desktop July Shakedown ====

Alan Pope reminds us that we are mid-way through the Ubuntu Artful development cycle, and as such it's a great time to grab and test the coming GNOME release. Alan provides some testing suggestions, hints on how to speak to developers, and asks you mark bug reports with 'julyshakedown'.

==== Robie Basak: Developing Ubuntu using git ====

Robie Basak from the Ubuntu Server Team describes a new workflow that new and experienced contributors alike can use to maintain Ubuntu packages using Git. He reminds us of previous efforts to attempt this with Bazaar, writing, "Some readers may be familiar with a previous effort in Ubuntu, UDD, which was largely a similar effort but with Bazaar. Nine years later, git has largely won the “VCS wars”, and appears to be preferred by the majority of developers. Our current effort could be seen as “UDD, but with git”, if you wish." He ends the post by noting that this is experimental and outlining what would make an initial release of this workflow.
