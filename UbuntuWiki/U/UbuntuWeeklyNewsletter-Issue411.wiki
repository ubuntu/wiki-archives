=== In The Press ===

==== Torvalds' temptress comes of age: Xfce 4.12 hits the streets ====

Scott Gilbertson of The Register reports that Xubuntu 15.04 will come with an update to Linus Torvalds’ briefly favoured Linux desktop, Xfce. He says some of Xfce 4.12 is already part of Xubuntu but the remainder will arrive in 15.04. Scott says of Xfce: "Xfce has grown in the last few years as the project has become something of a refuge for those unhappy with GNOME."

http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/04/03/xfce_4_12_review_linus_torvald_ubuntu/

==== Canonical to integrate Chef DevOps into Ubuntu ====

Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols for ZDNet writes that with Ubuntu being the most popular Linux on Amazon EC2 cloud it makes sense for Canonical to partner with Chef, one of the most popular Dev``Ops companies. He describes the benefits of Chef, shows us a large scale overview of Chef, and quotes Mark Shuttleworth as saying: "Chef and Ubuntu are often inseparable in serious server deployments, making mutual integration a must for our users."

=== In The Blogosphere ===

==== Linux Mint: No Plans to Drop Ubuntu as Base for Popular Desktop Linux OS ====

Christopher Tozzi, The VAR Guy, quotes one of Linux Mint's lead developers Clement Lefebvre as denying rumors that the Debian-based variant of Mint might become the project's main product. Tozzi says: "This might not seem like news worth caring about if you don't use Mint. But it matters for understanding Ubuntu's role within the world of desktop Linux distributions, where Canonical's OS remains vitally important to third-party projects."

He tells us that he found that not all distributions would install on the machine but adds: "The good news is that Ubuntu 15.04 64-bit works whether you disable secure boot or not."
