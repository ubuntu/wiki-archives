__TOC__

A scratch page for outstanding issues during the current dev cycle.

== Hardy Issues ==
=== Done (for reference) ===
* alsa-firmware is in Medibuntu, as inclusion in Ubuntu would require removing much of the supplied firmware. Hence, jockey handlers will not be supplied.
* mscore and fluid-soundfont are in Ubuntu, and work with each other.
** After discussion on the mailing list, consensus seems to be that regardless of size - and even and especially in the case of dial-up users - mscore and fluid-soundfont should be shipped on the DVD, and (presumably) as part of the ubuntustudio-audio seed.
* Icons for various mixer apps have a solid background. See persia. New .xpm: <nowiki>[[attachment:alsa-tools.xpm]]</nowiki> <nowiki>[[attachment:alsa-tools.svg]]</nowiki>
* Add icon for Genpo (rexbron)

=== Issues (must do for release) ===
* Release notes.
* Website update.

=== Needs Done (not critical) ===

* Edit descriptions in our metas so that they display correctly in tasksel. (Joe should work with Luke on this)
