=== General Community News ===

==== Call for nominations: Developer Membership Board ====

Robie Basak writes again about the Developer Membership Board election, reminding us of the four members who have stepped down. Robie once again asks for any Core Dev or MOTU to consider applying for a position on the DMB board, as five required nominations haven't yet been received.

==== How are we improving Firefox snap performance? Part 1 ====

Oliver Smith reminds us of the aim of Ubuntu Desktop, which firefox plays a large part in, thus why performance matters. Providing a reminder of the benefits of firefox as a snap and some of the tradeoffs, we are again reminded why firefox is now a snap. The article then moves to performance, including cold-start, warm-start & other performance metrics, and provides some example benchmarks. Some reasons for different timings are provided, as well as ways the benchmarks may be able to be improved; in fact, some fixes have already landed. Finally we're provided tools (created by Marco '3v1n0' Trevisan) should we wish to create our own benchmarks on our own hardware which can be recorded on the discourse thread.

==== New audio server Pipewire coming to next version of Ubuntu ====

Liam Proven writes that the next release of Ubuntu (22.10) will "switch audio servers to the relatively new Pipe``Wire". We're told not to worry, and that most users won't even notice the change. We are given a brief history of sound servers and the Linux sound playback stack, before told of some of Pipe``Wire's advantages: including that of sound servers, and how Pipe``Wire 'plans' to simplify media handling, use less CPU, offer better latency, and work well with GNOME and the Wayland display server.
