Launchpad projects is a way to keep track of resources and do planning for specific projects.

The Ubuntu Studio launchpad projects are currently in need of some restructuring.

All Ubuntu Studio Launchpad projects should currently be a part of <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/ubuntustudio-project]]</nowiki>, but this may change in the future.

QUESTION: We have a project group called Ubuntu Studio, do we also need a project for it?
