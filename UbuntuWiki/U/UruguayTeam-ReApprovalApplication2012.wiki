=== Structure and Governance ===
In the last two years we kept the Uruguay's <nowiki>[[UruguayTeam-ConsejoComunitario|Community Council]]</nowiki> that is a 5 member board who are elected by other members from the team, this help us to have some sort of direction and planing for the future.

=== Roadmap ===
Over this 2 years we have accomplish almost all the goals we propose for us for this 2 years. <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UruguayTeam/ApprovalApplication#Roadmap|Roadmap 2010]]</nowiki> 

For this 2 years, we will keep this:

* We give support to users at our website and IRC channel.
 
* We plan to give Ubuntu Basic courses on our Website using Moodle.
 
* Advocacy, this will be to improve our CD distribution. People in different cities of Uruguay give out Ubuntu cds. In order to promote cds, we only ask for a blank cd in exchange in order to do more copies.
 
* Collect hardware in order to gift Institutions who work with kids. After we fix the hardware we Install Edubuntu and we vote which Institution we give them.

Also we plan this:

* We are organizing UbuConLA an Annual Conference that will be held in different Latin America countries each year, this project is a colaboration from Uruguay and Argentina LoCos. On June 1st took place the 1st edition in Buenos Aires and a few Uruguay Team Members went and took part giving talks and in the general organization.

* Ubuntu At Schools, this is the intention of Ubuntu-uy to help the Uruguayan Goverment in the Ceibal Project (Government project that is giving OLPC laptops to School kids (all Uruguayan Kids) and Classmate laptops to High School students, this laptops already have Ubuntu), on this bases we are supporting the Ceibal Project by giving talks to students and teachers and providing support.

* Get the infrastructure to have a Ubuntu Mirror in Uruguay, so we don't have to depend of the Brazilian one.

* Create new ways to get real meetings and events, as the Welcome Day, this is in a simple explanation, get all the LoCo people to the street and start giving flyers and talk to people passing by, on the last User Days activity we did this.

=== Past activities ===

We have the list of activities.
As we live in a heavy centralised country, we are trying to get the events out of Montevideo, so all the .10 release parties are heal in a different city to contribute the expansion of Ubuntu Uruguay with other people.
