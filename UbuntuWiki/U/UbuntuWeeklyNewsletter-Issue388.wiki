==== Randall Ross: Why Smart Phones Aren't - Reason #2 & Reason #3 ====

Randall Ross continues his posts explaining his concerns with the use of the term “smartphone”.  Randall reflects that despite the technology’s capabilities, users are asking each other “Where are you?” on the train and ignoring the fact that “silence is golden” while at the movies.

Jonathan Riddell shares the Kubuntu team's experiences of trying to solve a problem of a user's system that was running slow due to Baloo, the new indexer from KDE. He says changes to Unity were made as it was having problems with the CFQ scheduler. Jonathan concludes: "...it would be nice if the expectation was on Unity to get fixed rather than on Kubuntu to deal with the bureaucracy to workaround their workarounds."

==== Randall Ross: Writing About Ubuntu? Own Your Own Content ====

Ronnie Tucker draws from and links to a Softpedia article that shows that the Ubuntu Desktop flavor hasn't been the developer's focus for some time. He concludes his post by saying "Not all users know that the desktop environment that is now on Ubuntu Touch will also power the desktop version in the future, and that future is not very far ahead. In fact, it’s a lot closer than users imagine.

==== Unity 8 Desktop Still Planned In Time For Ubuntu 16.04 LTS ====

==== Ubuntu Touch Fully Forks Its Email Client ====

Michael Larabel of Phoronix writes that up to now the Ubuntu Touch email client has been based on the Trojita application but the Ubuntu Touch developers have stopped upstreaming their changes to Trojita and are now maintaining their own long-term fork called Dekko. Michael says that the reason for the changes is to create something that is tightly integrated into Ubuntu.
