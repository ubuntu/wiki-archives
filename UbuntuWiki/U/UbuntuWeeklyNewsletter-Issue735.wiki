==== Proposal: GNOME Text Editor as default text editor ====

Jeremy Bicha tells us GNOME 42 switched the recommended text editor to 'gnome-text-editor'; he proposes Ubuntu 22.10 use it as default too. We are given some selected features of the gnome-text-editor, and told how we can try it out now if we're using Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. Jeremy notes that whilst both 'gedit' and 'gnome-text-editor' have the same "Text Editor" name in Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, gedit will have its name changed to 'gedit' in Ubuntu 22.10. We are told if this proposal is acceptable, 'gedit' will still be available for install; being located in 'universe', and that the 'gnome-text-editor' will be able to be user-replaced still.

==== Modren: a modern Linux store ====

Rudra Saraswat introduces Modren, a software store that handles snaps, flatpaks from Flathub, “APT”, and DEB packages. We are given a brief comparison with other popular app stores, then provided a list of supported backends and environments. Finally is the roadmap list of what's been done & is yet to do.

https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/modren-a-modern-linux-store/28268

==== Proposal: Sushi installed by default as file previewer ====

Jeremy Bicha proposes 'gnome-sushi' gets included by default. Jeremy reminds us Sushi is a "previewer for nautilus", and how it's used; we are also reminded this has been proposed before. But it's different now with no dependencies to 'universe' anymore.

https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/proposal-sushi-installed-by-default-as-file-previewer/28322

==== Ubuntu Core 22 Beta is now available ====

David Beamonte reminds us Ubuntu Core is a flavor of Ubuntu optimized for IoT and edge devices, and is now available as Ubuntu Core 22 beta. We are reminded of the strengths of Ubuntu Core, provided a link to download the product, and told it'll be released in the coming weeks.
