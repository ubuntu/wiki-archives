==== Ubuntu App Showdown: let the voting begin! ====

David Planella reports that out of a surprising 150 applicants to the Ubuntu App Showdown, a remarkable 132 of them have qualified and made it to the final list, which has now been released. Judges will now have a full week to test and vote on the apps. Meanwhile, apps will begin being added to the Software Centre, where users will review and rate the apps to decide the community portion of the contest.

==== New Session Menu Lands in Ubuntu 12.10 ====

==== Dell's Ubuntu Laptop Program Enters Beta, 'Blows Away' Expectations ====

Katherine Noyes, PCWorld, reports on the success of  Project Sputnik, the effort that resulted in a prototype open-source laptop based on Ubuntu 12.04 and Dell’s XPS 13 hardware. Now entering the Beta phase, interested parties are asked to sign up to participate. “We've been blown away by the number of people who have wanted to be beta participants,” Barton George of Dell explains and goes on to say “if this gets the traction I think it will, you can bet Dell will start looking at others who would benefit from a similar solution.”

=== Launchpad News ===

==== Launchpad does not have private projects…yet. ====

Curtis Hovey writes about problems considering private projects and Purple squad work progress on the Disclosure feature. Hovey states: ”I think the problem here is that Launchpad squads no longer use Launchpad to plan and execute work. There is no place for any interested party to see what the goals of Disclosure is and gauge how we are progressing.”

Hovey also presents a Disclosure draft report, where it is can be seen what Purple squad is doing, has recently done, and will do next. The Disclosure draft report is available at http://people.canonical.com/~curtis/lp-milestone/report.html

==== Charlene Tessier: Make It Yours – A Guide to Lenses and Scopes ====

Charlene Tessier shares a quick-start guide to understanding Unity lenses and scopes. It covers what each of them are and how users can take advantage of them.

==== Ubuntu TV: Ubuntu TV Weekly Update ====

This week’s Ubuntu TV update covers news about the port from Unity 2D to 3D, a working stand-alone mode, and scopes including Video, Music, DVR, and Pictures, as well as more technical notes about metadata and removing Qt to make way for Nux.

http://www.doadjustyourset.com/2012/07/09/ubuntu-tv-weekly-update/

==== Barneedhar: Test Quantal kernels on Precise ====

Testing Quantal kernels in 12.04 is a great way to help the kernel team to provide better hardware support in the 12.04 release. The post outlines the steps necessary to download, install, and test the newer kernel versions. Any bugs should be reported in launchpad.

http://unbrokenspectrum.wordpress.com/2012/07/12/test-quantal-kernels-on-precise/

==== David Henningsson: Top five wrong ways to fix your audio ====

David Henningsson writes about five common, outdated ways people try to fix issues with audio. Among the suggestions are not trying to update ALSA, not purging Pulse``Audio, and not replacing ALSA with OSS.

http://voices.canonical.com/david.henningsson/2012/07/13/top-five-wrong-ways-to-fix-your-audio/

=== Canonical News ===

==== Changes to Contacts ====

The Ubuntu One team is announcing that they are removing the Facebook contact import and sync feature in Ubuntu One. They cite turning off old features reliant on the old infrastructure in favor of moving to a new syncing infrastrcuture, U1DB. Users who have already added their Facebook contacts will continue to have access to that information.

http://voices.canonical.com/ubuntuone/2012/07/11/changes-to-contacts/

=== In The Press ===

==== Canonical, the FSF and the Ongoing Secure Boot Saga ====

Linux Inside reports on the continuing back-and-forth between the Free Software Foundation and Canonical over the proposed plan to overcome issues with secure boot. Disagreements of licenses and a shift to an alternate bootloader, as opposed to Grub 2, are among the top issues discussed.

http://www.linuxinsider.com/story/75612.html

==== Must have missing features in Ubuntu ====

Datamation writes on missing features that new users to Ubuntu, or Linux in general, are expecting when migrating over. One of the features is system restore, which lets users move back to a known good working installation of the operating system. Other missing features include wide-spread inclusions of driver discs with new hardware from the manufacturers, and the ability to easily install software without an active Internet connection.

=== In The Blogosphere ===

==== Thunderfork: Canonical’s Chance To Expand Its Ecosystem With Thunderbird ====

Dean Howell, The Power``Base, writes about Canonical’s innovations around the GUI. When considering innovations, Howell gave the most focus to Thunderbird and its future. Howell states:”Thunderbird integration in Unity is a hack-job. Forking Thunderbird and bending it to fit the will of Ubuntu makes sense. Forking the project and making a version available for Android and iOS to gain adoption, increase mind-share and raise the visibility of it’s cloud services is simply genius.”

http://www.thepowerbase.com/2012/07/thunderfork-canonicals-chance-to-expand-its-ecosystem-with-thunderbird/

==== All About Ubuntu One ====

Hoo Ann, Ezine@rticles, posts about Ubuntu one features, and benefits from its usage namely: storage, online backup, folder/file synchronisation, availability and approachability from other operating systems, and music streaming. Ann states: “Ubuntu One with 5GB of free storage is better than Dropbox and equal to Sugarsync and Google Drive.”

==== There‘s no shortage of Asus Ubuntu netbooks in Italy ====

Joey Sneddon, OMG! Ubuntu!, posts about the shortage of ASUS netbooks, preloaded with Ubuntu, in the UK. Discussing the shortage, Sneddon mentions that in Italy it is a completely different situation. Since Sneddon's source is in Italian, he presents some specs of the ASUS netbooks to make it easier for ones who are not familiar with the Italian language.

==== Preloaded Ubuntu laptops all set to compete against Windows ====

Vaibhav Panwar, REVTHATUP, posts about: Ubuntu’s competition with Windows, Canonical’s partnership with Dell, entrance into new markets like India and China, and advantages of Ubuntu.
