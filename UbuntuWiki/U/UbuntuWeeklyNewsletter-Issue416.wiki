http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/05/05/ubuntu_15_04_review/

==== Ubuntu 15.04 review: Beauty or “boring” is in the eye of the beholder ====

Scott Gilbertson of Ars Technica writes a review of Ubuntu 15.04, writing that on the desktop: “Ubuntu 15.04's Unity desktop is mature, stable, and not really in need of many improvements.” He continues by discussing changes to server, the default kernel and changes to some of the flavor releases.

==== Ubuntu may beat Windows 10 to phone-PC convergence after all ====

Chris Hoffman of PCWorld writes a comparison of the efforts for PC convergence by Microsoft for Windows to those of Canonical with Ubuntu, noting that both companies have slipped deadlines for convergence. He speculates on the promised Ubuntu Phone convergence release this year: “Canonical will probably still get there, but Microsoft might beat Ubuntu to convergence even if it does launch the new phone this year. If the phone slips to 2016, Microsoft will almost certainly beat them to market.“
