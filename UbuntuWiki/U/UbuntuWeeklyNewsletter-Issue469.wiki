=== In The Blogosphere ===

==== Canonical lines up more partnerships -- positive Juju abounds ====

Ben Kepes writes for Computer``World about Mark Shuttleworth, Canonical and Juju, for orchestration of software. He shares news that with the new version of Juju is being released, and it is gaining partners. Treasure``Data and Datafellas are among the partners. This helps keep their customers satisfied with a consistent platform. He concludes: “Canonical can always be relied upon to think about not only where the technology industry is today but, to borrow a metaphor, about where the puck is heading. Something tells me that Shuttleworth and co. have found some good Juju here.”

==== BQ Aquaris M10 Ubuntu Tablet Review: In-Depth ====

Chris Barraclough for Recombu writes an in depth review of the bq Aquaris M10 tablet, covering the hardware design, screen and audio, cameras and performance and battery-life. He goes on to talk about convergence and the other features this tablet brings to market, and how they integrate with the tablet. He concludes with some of his criticisms of the device, but writes “Still, the likes of Convergence is a solid indication that Ubuntu has a lot to offer on a mobile platform and we're intrigued to see what comes next.”

==== Canonical Releases Snapcraft 2.10 Snaps Creator with Support for ZIP Files, More ====

==== New Ebook: The Complete Beginner’s Guide to Ubuntu 16.04 ====

https://www.maketecheasier.com/new-ebook-ubuntu-16-04/

==== Help Test a New Version of Ubuntu Software ====

Joey-Elijah Sneddon writess in response to Ubuntu Desktop Manager Will Cooke's call for people to help testing new revisions of Ubuntu GNOME software. Currently 16.04 uses GNOME 3.20.1 but testing of GNOME 3.20.2 is requested. A PPA for the 3.20.2 GNOME-software is provided.

==== Ubuntu Phone used by 60+ year olds ====

Dedoimedo writes about the introduction of the Ubuntu phone to a man and a woman over 60 and shares their experiences. He covers their basic experiences with the UI, message functionality, popular applications and browser and more. He reflects on overall impressions and writes a length conclusion, including “What really matters is the user opinion, and in this regard, the Ubuntu Phone did pretty well. No complaints. The test bunnies also praised the robust, lightweight design, the camera ease of use, even though the quality is a bit meh, the quality of phone calls, and the general friendliness of the product.”

http://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/ubuntu-phone-elderly.html

==== Canonical Fixes Convergence Issues With OTA 11 Update ====

Derek Forrest for Tom’s Hardware reports on the latest fixes that came with OTA 11 for Ubuntu tablets and phones, writing “the difference in responsiveness is night and day on the Aquaris M10” and that “the device seems like a whole different product.” He concludes: “We said in our initial writeup that Canonical had some work to do before the M10 and its Ubuntu-powered features were ready for users, and we're pleased to see that it did that work. The OTA 11 update may have just renewed the chances of mainstream (and/or enterprise) adoption of Ubuntu's convergence concept, if developers can get behind the platform.”
