== Update the website ==
* Wrap up new theme by 16th of June (Jorge)
* Discuss content/features with team (July 21st). Potential (Drupal-based) features:
** Forums
** Blog
** Wiki
** OpenID authentication (modules from https://launchpad.net/ubuntu-drupal useful?)
** User profiles/map
** Social networking (FB like, share on FB/Twitter, etc.)
* Decide whether to move website to own server
** Cons - requires hosting budget (means of funding would have to be discussed)
** Pros - more autonomy & flexibility, leading to increased potential for collaboration
* If site to remain in current server, then obtain access from Canonical for Scott Lavender ASAP (and others?)
* New website deployment target date: September 1st. Staging will happen earlier, so that design/structure/potential content can be reviewed and discussed.

== live installer ==
lets push this to 12.04 (or further as needed)

== UI change ==
we should have something to look at soon showing XFCE and AWN and a more specific direction. this is something we should be working on in the next few weeks as well so we can test. start testing around the first alpha?

== Artwork ==
discuss what is realistic with Dick Mac``Innis ASAP.

== Testing ==
* UI testing - as needed
* kernel testing
* firewire tests
* expand into specific package tests?
* iso testing as per http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/
