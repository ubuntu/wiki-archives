==== Linux world gains ability to repair exFAT drives ====

Liam Proven reminds us the FAT file-system is still needed. Liam relates the historical need to purchase a license to use it before a free open source means was available, and then Ubuntu users could mount exFAT partitions with the 5.4 linux kernel. We are told the "forthcoming version 1.2" of exfatprogs will include "a fsck.exfat command that can repair filesystem damage". We are reminded the tool already existed, but only reported damage in prior versions.
