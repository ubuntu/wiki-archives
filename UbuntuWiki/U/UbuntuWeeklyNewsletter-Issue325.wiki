==== Mark Shuttleworth: Two weeks with Mir ====

Mark Shuttleworth writes about his experience using Mir for the past two weeks. He notes that the system feels smoother using Mir, and that X and Compiz appear to be using less memory and fewer CPU cycles than when X was directly handling the hardware. He then goes on to discuss competition, the importance of making the Mir decision, and expresses his desire for other variants and distributions to consider Mir.

==== James Page: Ubuntu OpenStack SRU cadence ====

James Page discusses the rationale behind a recent change in Ubuntu’s Open``Stack Stable Release Update (SRU) cadence. “For future Open``Stack point releases the Ubuntu Server team will be following a new cadence for pushing these releases into Ubuntu. This should allow the team to test and promote a point release of Open``Stack into Ubuntu within two weeks of the upstream point release. Hopefully this will allow users of Open``Stack on Ubuntu to plan upgrades a little more effectively going forwards [sic].”
