==== Don't Use Proposed ====

Alan Pope writes after being 'bit' by packages from the proposed repository. Alan provides a brief explanation of the various repositories Ubuntu has, including the "dangerzone" as Alan calls the proposed repository. Brief mention is made of the Ubuntu Stable Release Updates process, and how updated packages enter the Ubuntu repositories. We are then told why Alan wanted to use proposed (to use the 5.10 kernel) and a note to himself to be more careful next time.

https://popey.com/blog/2021/02/dont-use-proposed/

==== All Ahead Stop ====

Alan Pope writes that the Ubuntu archive for hirsute "has been temporarily frozen". Mentioning a "knarly bug" that is causing them to build in a broken state. Alan then steps back in the story, to tell us certain events that made him aware of an issue which led to a bug being raised, and then debugging by Canonical's Kai-Heng Feng and friend Andrew Hayzen. This led to fixes for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS & Ubuntu 20.10. Linking back to the prior ('Don't use proposed') article, Alan reports problems appearing after installing proposed updates, and then walks us through the events that lead to another problem being discovered, and again ends a blog post with "Don't use proposed". Many links are provided.

https://popey.com/blog/2021/02/all-ahead-stop/

==== APT 2.2 released ====

Julian Andres Klode looks at the changes found in Apt 2.2, used by Ubuntu 20.10, Ubuntu hirsute and Debian testing/sid. We are first given a list of new features, some behavioral changes, a couple of performance improvements, a list of bug fixes, some security fixes, and finally a list of depreciations.

https://blog.jak-linux.org/2021/02/18/apt-2.2/

==== Season Fourteen ====

Alan Pope writes that it was nearly thirteen years ago that a few members of the Ubuntu UK Lo``Co team released S0``1E``01 of the Ubuntu UK Podcast. This continued for 187 episodes over seven years before being re-branded as the Ubuntu Podcast, which went for a further 251 episodes over six years. We are reminded of what occurs each year with the curry (virtual this year), and are told the great news that they'll be back next month with Season Fourteen.

==== Ubuntu 21.04 to Use Dark GNOME Shell Theme By Default? ====

Joey Sneddon writes that "plans are afoot to make Ubuntu 21.04 use a dark theme by default". Joey discusses the recent releases that provided three options, but because it impacted two settings, the effect wasn't quite what users expected. Briefly outlining the change, with an added graphic (with slider) to help you understand what Joey is describing, we are told that as Ubuntu 21.04 is still in development, things may still change.

==== Have You Found GNOME Desktop’s Hidden Easter Egg? ====

Joey Sneddon asks us if we're aware "that the GNOME desktop comes with a hidden easter egg?". Joey tells us he discovered via Reddit that a "neat novelty" is found in recent releases of Ubuntu desktop, and is, in his opinion, the "Greatest of All Time" featuring GNOME's GEGL mascot.

==== Ubuntu 21.04 Is Now Powered by Linux 5.10 LTS, Wayland Enabled by Default ====

Marius Nestor reports on the updates for the forthcoming release. The Ubuntu Kernel Team, after proper testing, has decided to go with the 5.10 LTS kernel rather than a newer - perhaps unstable - kernel. Additionally, the Wayland session will be the default, though the traditional Xorg session remains available. Furthermore release 21.04 will "ship with the GNOME 3.38 desktop environment and Python 3.9 by default, as well as many up-to-date core components including GNU C Library 2.33, GCC 10.2.1, and LLVM 12".
