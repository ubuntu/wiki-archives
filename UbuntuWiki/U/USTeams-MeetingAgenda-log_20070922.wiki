12:06 <  atoponce> greg-g: cool. i forgot
12:06 <  djennewe> thanks
12:06 <  atoponce> pleia2: well, what good is this? we advertise it, make arrangements so everyone can be present, and the ones who want it moved can't be here?
12:07 <    pleia2> atoponce: yeah, this is not very good
12:07 <     etank> nope
12:07 < johnc4510> nope
12:07 <   nealmcb> for those who are new: translate nicks to names and roles here:  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/USTeams/
12:07              greg-g shakes head
12:07 <  atoponce> well then, we're at a crossroads. we can continue on, or see if we can get a better turnout another time
12:08 <  atoponce> i really want everyone's feelings on this issue. i want to completely understand where people are coming from and what the best solutions would be
12:08 < johnc4510> agreed
12:08 <     etank> are those that have the issues present now?
12:09 < johnc4510> and discussing without them here defeats the purpose
12:09 <  atoponce> if we don't have everyone here, then we won't get a good sample of how the nation feels
12:09 < johnc4510> yep
12:09 <  atoponce> etank: one is, the other is not
12:09 <  atoponce> at least according to the wiki
12:09 <   nealmcb> I put up a few topics to add a bit of balance :-)
12:10 <   nealmcb> I agree that having all concerned here would be better
12:10 <     etank> adding the CoC was a nice touch nealmcb
12:10 <  atoponce> ok. let's vote
12:10 <  atoponce> those who want to defer the meeting to a later date
12:10 <     etank> should we guve it to about 12:30 or so?
12:10 <     etank> s/guve/give/
12:10 <  atoponce> etank: today? i'll be at a birthday party during that time
12:10 <    greg-g> +1 for etank
12:11 <  atoponce> :(
12:11 <     etank> sorry
12:11 <   nealmcb> I also welcome the sort of input that bordy offers, and have sympathy with some of the arguments (but not the sentiments) expressed by Martin
12:11 <    greg-g> I think etank means give it another 15 minutes
12:11 <     etank> that would be 12:30 my time
12:11 <  atoponce> oh
12:11 <     etank> yeah 15 or 20 minutes
12:11              atoponce sees 10:11 in his clock
12:11 <  atoponce> yeah. let's do that
12:11 <     etank> darn time zones
12:11 <    greg-g> ok, everyone pause!
12:12 <    greg-g> :)
12:12              johnc4510 we could discuss nealmcb items and see if DoctorMO_away shows up
12:12 < johnc4510> or not
12:12 <   nealmcb> I can go either way
12:12 <  atoponce> i would like to get a lot of opinions from everyone on all issues brought up rather than a select few
12:13 < johnc4510> kk
12:13 <    greg-g> true true
12:13 < johnc4510> good thinking
12:13 < johnc4510> that's why you get the big bucks atoponce
12:13 <   nealmcb> NO NO LETS DISCUSS IT ALL AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN!!
12:13 < johnc4510> :)
12:13 <    greg-g> gives me a few minutes to get some more reading done anyways
12:13 <     etank> -1 nealmcb
12:13 <   nealmcb> :-)
12:14 <  atoponce> if we can't execute today, how are weekday evenings?
12:14 < johnc4510> ok with me
12:14 <    greg-g> +1
12:14 <  atoponce> it may be better to get jono on board during that time vs saturdays
12:14 < johnc4510> agreed
12:14 <    greg-g> I agree with having Jono here
12:15 <     etank> evenings are better for me
12:15 <     etank> except for Wed and Thur
12:16 <     Zelut> tonyyarusso: pong
12:16 < johnc4510> Zelut: howdy
12:17 <     Zelut> howdy
12:17 <     etank> Zelut == one of my favorite g33ktors

12:17 < johnc4510> mind
12:18 <     etank> same here

12:19 <    greg-g> :)
12:23              nealmcb finishes re-reading http://www.ubuntu.com/community/conduct
12:23 <   nealmcb> good stuff in there....
12:23              greg-g agrees
12:23 <   nealmcb> perhaps we should choose another time, while we finish waiting?
12:24 <   nealmcb> proposals?
12:24 <  atoponce> anything after oct 1
12:24 <  atoponce> work has me on ball and chain until that time
12:24 < johnc4510> oct 2   hee hee

12:28 <   nealmcb> :-)
12:28 < johnc4510> :)
12:28 <     etank> sounds good for me
12:29 <     etank> i can cut our LoCo team meeting short that night
12:29 <  atoponce> ok. let's reschedule then. for those of you with blogs, esp on planet ubuntu, let's advertise this thing
12:29 < johnc4510> kk
12:29 <  atoponce> get it on your mailing list, loco forum, etc
12:29 <    greg-g> good deal

12:30 <     etank> sounds good
12:30 < johnc4510> atoponce: kk, i'll take care of that later today
12:30 < johnc4510> mail list and forum
12:30 <     etank> so that means 25 people then :)
12:30 <   nealmcb> If there is a summary of the outcome of previous discussions on legal stuff, funding npo etc, can it be posted beforehand?
12:30 <   nealmcb> having a positive agenda would be more inspiring than a complaint-driven agenda
12:31 <     etank> nealmcb: you are so right there
12:31 <   nealmcb> along with agenda items on how to get the next states online etc
12:31 <    greg-g> I agree, but sometimes we need meetings about problems
12:31 <   nealmcb> sure
12:31 <    greg-g> if we don't want this meeting to expand beyond what its goal was
12:31 <     etank> but not be negative about the problems
12:32 <    greg-g> of course
