==== Mercurial Imports will end on October 5th ====

Matthew Revell of Launchpad shares that “on the 5th of October they’ll be ending their beta of Mercurial imports in Launchpad. On that day existing Mercurial imports will cease and there won’t be any possibility to create new ones.” However, Revell points out that “this doesn’t affect Bazaar, Git, Subversion or CVS imports.” The reason for Mercurial ending is because of low usage and low quality.

=== Ubuntu Cloud News ===

==== How we ran the scheduler for the Linux Plumbers conference ====

Jorge Castro discusses how Ubuntu’s cloud team, together with Summit OSS maintainer Chris Johnston, hosted, deployed, and managed the Linux plumbers conference schedule via juju.
Since Castro and his team are “generalizing this work into a more generic Django charm,” anyone interested can contact Castro. Help is not required just with Django but with “Pyramid, nodejs, Rails and $your_favorite_web_platform” as well.

http://www.jorgecastro.org/2012/09/26/how-we-ran-the-scheduler-for-the-linux-plumbers-conference/

Victor Tuson Palau continues his blog series demonstrating how Ubuntu is the best environment to write up “connected” or “cloud backend” Android Apps using Juju with a blog post titled “How to test if it all works in a production environment?”

==== Xubuntu: Offline documentation rewritten for 12.10 ====

http://xubuntu.org/news/offline-documentation-rewritten-for-12-10/

==== Jono Bacon: More Information About Online Dash Search Privacy ====

Jono Bacon responds to some of the concerns about user privacy that have arisen since the inclusion of the ability for the Dash to search external sources for results. After speaking with John Lenton, Senior Engineering Manager, Jono reassures users that no user-identifiable data is retrieved during the search, and that Canonical does not perform any kind of user tracking. They also touched upon concerns about the searches being unencrypted, saying “we are currently working to encrypt these dash searches ready for the release of this feature in Ubuntu 12.10.”

In a later post, Bacon re-enforces that the shopping lens is still under development and testing, and that there will be an option to easily disable it.

==== Charlene Tessier: In Response – Ubuntu: Re-Doing the Possible ====

Charlene Tessier writes about problems around Ubuntu usage and adoption, and criticism by existing users about recent changes to the operating system, speculating that 99% of people don’t know what Ubuntu is or what it is for. We want to reach all of these other people, so Tessier thinks that a solution for the adoption problem is to go out on the street and talk with people who haven’t used Ubuntu yet to see what they like and prefer.

==== Stéphane Graber: Introducing the python LXC API ====

Graber also discusses how the initial implementation of the API has been pushed to the LXC staging branch on github and into the LXC package of Ubuntu 12.10.

==== Meet The Ubuntu Women - They're More Involved Than You Think ====

Veronica Henry of Read``Write``Web shares an interview with Ubuntu Women, Elizabeth Krumbach, and Cheri Francis. Henry points out that Ubuntu Women is a “non political organization, so you'll find no mentions of feminism but rather a safe place where women, curious about the Ubuntu developer community can come and ask questions without fear of intimidation or condescension.” Henry also highlights crucial parts of the Ubuntu Women organization such as mentoring, contributions, and education.

Henry points out that, as in any part of the Ubuntu project, people are welcome to join Ubuntu Women as well. They can do that by “contacting anyone on the leadership team (wiki.ubuntu-women.org/Contacts ) or check out the #ubuntu-women and #ubuntu-women-project IRC channels.”

=== Featured Audio and Video ===

==== Ubuntu Ohio - Burning Circle: Burning Circle Episode 84 ====

Stephen Michael Kellat brings us news, among other things, about the Amazon shopping experience under Ubuntu, and mass market needs. The question is raised whether to be proactive in announcing a feature or being reactive when somebody else says something about it. Most simply put: Is anybody responsible for communicating to the non-developer mass market about these sorts of features prior to their incorporation?
