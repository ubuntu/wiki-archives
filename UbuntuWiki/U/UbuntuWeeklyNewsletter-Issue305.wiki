* Adding an ‘incognito’ style toggle in the Dash for anonymous browsing
* Including individual toggles for scopes and lenses for customisation

==== Ubuntu Pros and Cons ====

Bruce Byfield of Datamation looks at the pros and cons as he sees them of Ubuntu.
Cons include:

1. Increasing Insularity of Development
2. The Commercial Controlling the Community
3. Designing for Mobile Devices
4. Forgotten Roots
5. Ads on the desktop
6. Privacy and Security Issues
7. Introducing Proprietary Elements

Pros include:
1. Simplified Installation
2. An Emphasis on Localization
3. Launchpad
4. Regular Release Cycles
5. Encrypted Home Directories
6. Community Building
7. Concern About Usability

“But instead of praising or criticizing Ubuntu and Canonical wholeheartedly, it seems more reasonable to approach them without expectations, judging them by their actions rather than their marketing or their past,” said Byfield about his thoughts on finding balance.

http://www.datamation.com/open-source/ubuntu-pros-and-cons-1.html

==== Why More People Are Choosing Ubuntu ====

Matt Hartley of Datamation writes, “In this article, we'll explore why Ubuntu is succeeding, why some folks dislike Ubuntu and how this affects (or doesn't affect) other Linux distributions.”  The areas he explores include learning for others, desktop environments and general usability, Unity and the Dash controversy, and the various Ubuntu derivatives.

Hartley notes in his final thoughts, “And despite the fact that sometimes Ubuntu's development cycle may frustrate me, the core Ubuntu experience has been very good to me.”
