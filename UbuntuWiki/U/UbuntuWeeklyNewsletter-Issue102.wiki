==== QA to Launchpad Liaison ====

The Ubuntu QA team is interested in establishing a liaison to the Launchpad team. Because Launchpad is heavily used and critical for QA activities in Ubuntu it is important that Ubuntu QA is well represented to the Launchpad development and management teams.

The liaison's duties would include:

* Provide Launchpad developers with prioritized bugs/specs relevant to Ubuntu QA
* Provide Ubuntu QA with information on Launchpad changes and progress
* Drive discussion around needed Launchpad changes or possible bug fixes
* Advocate on behalf of Ubuntu QA to Launchpad developers and management
* Do the all of the above in as transparent and collaborative of a way as possible

Some useful liaison activities:

* Solicit Launchpad feedback on a specific change or Launchpad feature
* Solicit individual priority bugs affecting QA
* Consult Launchpad developers for possible future directions

=== New in Intrepid Ibex ===

==== Java Open jdk6 promoted to main ====

Recently Openjdk6 was promoted to main; with today's upload of java-common, OpenJDK6 is the default java runtime / development kit in main, on all architectures.

* On amd64, i386, lpia and sparc, the Hotspot VM, including the JIT compiler is used as the VM.
* On ia64, the Hotspot VM, using the byte code interpreter is used.
* On powerpc, the Cacao VM, including the Cacao JIT compiler is used as the VM.

What will change for the packaging?

* Use of the default-jre-headless, default-jre, default-jdk, default-jdk-builddep packages is preferred in favour of a specific runtime/jdk. The packages provide a symlink /usr/lib/jvm/default-java to point to our preferred choice of jvm/sdk.
* build dependencies: If a source package builds a "-gcj" package, don't stop building it yet. This will slow down the gij runtime. Instead, use "default-jdk-builddep", which depends on the default jdk and java-gcj-compat-dev. If no "-gcj" package is built, use default-jdk as a build dependency.
* dependencies: For a dependency, which doesn't require an UI, use default-jre-headless | java2-runtime-headless
* for all other dependencies, use default-jre | java2-runtime Replace java2- with java5- only if newer language features are required.

For intrepid the team will strive to replace all direct references to java-gcj-compat-dev and java-gcj-compat with references to default-*. https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel-announce/2008-July/000460.html

=== Launchpad News ===

==== Launchpad 2.0 Radically Improves Collaboration for Open Source Projects ====

The formal notification of the roll-out of Launchpad 2.0 has arrived. Launchpad was conceived as a nexus of collaboration for Open Source projects to make them more efficient to build, easier to collaborate on, and more open to innovation from community participation, according to Mark Shuttleworth, CEO, Canonical. What it means to the individual is the ability to branch and merge code, mailing lists to keep track of changes and bugs, integration with Bugzilla and Track to work together with other communities, and a simpler, more intuitive web interface.  View the tour at https://launchpad.net/+about

http://www.ubuntu.com/news/launchpad2-improves-collaboration

==== Launchpad 2.0: new beta API, new UI and more! ====

Launchpad 2.0 has arrived with a new logo, a new look and lots of new features. This release brings together new features from the past nine months of Launchpad’s development and introduces two exciting beta features.

* Restful web services API and Python library - One of the main goals for Launchpad 2.0 has been to make it easier to manipulate data in Launchpad. With this release, Launchpad is introducing a beta test of two features that will enable you to develop external applications that can authenticate, query and modify data in Launchpad’s database.
** a restful web services API
** a Python library to access the new API

Initially, the API will provide access to files, and search for bugs, people and teams systems. Full details of the API and Python library will be detailed later this week. In the mean time, apply to join the Launchpad Beta Testers team if you’d like to take part in the beta testing. https://launchpad.net/~launchpad-beta-testers

* Closer integration with Bugzilla and Trac - Often, bugs in free software affect more than one project. Launchpad lets projects share the same bug report and comment history, however up until now, that has only been available where each project uses Launchpad as their bug tracker. With Launchpad 2.0 comes the introduction beta testing of two new GPL plugins — one for Bugzilla, one for Trac — that enable projects to share a comment history between the bug as it’s tracked in Launchpad and on external trackers.

* Simpler page layout and navigation - One of the most obvious changes in Launchpad 2.0 is the web interface’s new design. The aim has been to simplify the layout and navigation. There’s more information at the launchpad blog here: http://news.launchpad.net/cool-new-stuff/simpler-launchpad-web-interface

==== Mark Shuttleworth: Launchpad to be open source in 12 months ====

Mark Shuttleworth says that Launchpad will likely be open sourced within the year.  During his keynote address at OSCON, Shuttleworth put to rest the criticism of some in the open source community that the project hosting platform was proprietary software.  Specifically, Shuttleworth said, "We will release the source code within the next twelve months." Ryan Paul believes the Launchpad user interface is already a much better service than competing closed-source project hosting services, but opening it up to the community will allow it to accelerate development. http://arstechnica.com/journals/linux.ars/2008/07/23/mark-shuttleworth-launchpad-to-be-open-source-in-12-months

=== In The Press ===

* Launchpad Wants to Host Your Project - In a blog written by Mike Gunderloy, he shows that Launchpad is making GPL-licensed add ons for bug-tracking status and history sharing with other projects that use Bugzilla or Trac.  Also, there is the RESTful API, giving access to some of Launchpad's services.  The intention is that more services will be added in the future.  The combination of the new features in Launchpad, especially the API, make it a good choice for those looking to the future.  http://ostatic.com/169995-blog/launchpad-wants-to-host-your-project

* Will a $19.99 Ubuntu Succeed Where the Free Version Hasn’t? - Ubuntu is now on store shelves at Best``Buy, and Adrian Kingsley-Hughes takes a look at some questions concerning this.  One thing that he doesn't understand is why people who are capable of researching and downloading pirated copies of software don't just download or buy a copy of Linux, instead. He believes that a Linux install goes pretty smoothly on most modern desktop PCs. If things go wrong however, and they can go wrong, then even with the backing of tech support a Linux newbie is going to see a side of Linux that they’ll probably not forget. Read his opinions at:  http://itmanagement.earthweb.com/osrc/article.php/3761616/Will+a+$19.99+Ubuntu+Succeed+Where+the+Free+Version+Hasn%E2%80%99t

=== In The Blogosphere ===

* Economic clustering and Free Software release coordination - In a follow-up to a presentation he made at the Linux Symposium, Mark Shuttleworth elaborates on the benefits of coordination in distribution releases.  In this blog article, he shows how car manufacturers all work off a common baseline of features, and this commonality doesn't deter the brand loyalty of the customers. The fashion industry is another industry where releases are coordinated to achieve maximum effect. It is Shuttleworth's contention that the coordination of freezes and releases will build a stronger impact on the global software market. http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/159

* Ubuntu 8.10 (Intrepid Ibex) Alpha 3, Screen shots and New Theme Proposals - The "Break It Down" blog takes a look at some of the proposed features of Intrepid Ibex, concentrating on the theme and icons that may be used. The blog noted that the theme appears to be a trendy dark theme, despite the fact that the theme for Hardy Heron was a lighter one. In addition, new icons were proposed with a more asymmetric look to them.  There are a number of other items listed in the article, with links to their features. http://www.breakitdownblog.com/ubuntu-810-intrepid-ibex-alpha-3-screenshots-and-new-theme-proposals/

* Linux``World Expo Preview: Four Canonical and Ubuntu Linux Trends - The Var Guy takes a look at the upcoming Linux``World Expo, August 4 in San Francisco, and raises some possibilities concerning revelations by Ubuntu and Canonical.  His suggestions include server-oriented application relationships, an appliance initiative tied to Ubuntu Server, Netbooks as being a higher priority than Mobile Internet Devices (MIDs), and for Ubuntu to be the defacto platform used on thousands of PCs that are donated to area schools. http://www.thevarguy.com/2008/07/28/linuxworld-expo-preview-four-canonical-and-ubuntu-linux-trends/

* XP vs Ubuntu, the beginning - After having some trouble with another OS, the author installed Ubuntu on a dual boot configuration. Partitioning was easy with GParted and the installation was a breeze. Best of all, everything worked after the install, including wireless which had been a big problem on the other OS. In fact, the install was so easy that it left him a bit confused, like there should have been something else to do. His conclusion is that out of the box Linux really is better. http://borisg.wordpress.com/2008/07/28/xp-vs-ubuntu-the-beginning/

* 10 + 2 things you’ll get with Ubuntu 8.10 “Intrepid Ibex” - Fabrizio Balliano outlines some things proposed for the Intrepid Ibex release.  These include faster login, better Flash experience, 3G networking, guest account, cleaning up no longer used packages, automatic download of printer drivers, font selector, faster installation from desktop DVD, installation from USB stick, and new graphic for the installer.  Additional possibilities are identity management and network authentication, and Package``Kit cross-distro package manager.  http://fabrizioballiano.net/2008/07/19/10-2-things-youll-get-with-ubuntu-810-intrepid-ibex/

* No! Wha…oooh…wow. Yes! - The author of this article is a tech business owner who uses Ubuntu on his iMac to show friends and customers the advantages of using open source. He thinks using Linux is a lot like listening to an undiscovered band, one that none of his friends have listened to. When they first experience it they want it, because there is something in the experience that gives the initial impression extra impact. When customers realize that the system is built upon a foundation of free and open software they have a newfound respect. Linux is its best sales tool, because it creates curiosity. http://www.ubuntuproductivity.com/journal/ubuntu/07/2008/marketing_linux_to_small_business/

==== Linux pre-installs rocket to three per cent ====

Linux has made headway in Microsoft's UK heartland, the PC sales channel. The number of machines shipped with Linux preloaded on them has multiplied a whopping 28 times since Microsoft launched its Vista operating system in January 2007. This sounds impressive, but Linux was starting from a rather small base in traditional UK sales channels. The Linux share of this route to market has edged up ever since the Vista launch. It broke the two per cent barrier in May after the latest release of Ubuntu, the strain of Linux most capable of kicking Microsoft in the shins. http://www.theinquirer.net/gb/inquirer/news/2008/08/01/linux-preloads-rocket-per-cent

==== Steve Stalcup Interview ====

Steve Stalcup(aka Vorian) lives in Ohio with his wife and 4 children. After using Ubuntu since 5.04, he is now devoting his interests to Kubuntu. Steve is involved in many community projects and he recently earned his MOTU status. He started by contributing in small ways, and gradually tackled larger and more complex tasks. Then, before he knew it, he was getting new packages into Ubuntu and Debian. There were a lot of great resources he used to learn the basics of packaging. The “Old” Ubuntu packaging guide, and the Debian New Maintainers Guide in particular, but the MOTU team is great about helping anyone learn about packaging. For the intrepid release, Steve is focusing on Kubuntu, in order to help make it a top shelf release, but will also help in the sponsorship queue as a way of thanking all the sponsors who helped him. See the full interview at the link. http://behindmotu.wordpress.com/2008/08/02/steve-stalcup-vorian/
