==== Ubuntu 16.04 LTS with Unity 8 to Run GTK+ Apps Natively ====

Silviu Stahie of Softpedia shares results from a recent UOS session held by the Ubuntu Desktop Team. He reports that in the future, Unity 8 will be able to run GTK+ apps natively, quoting Ubuntu desktop lead Will Cooke about their work “working on the Mir-GTK backend at the moment so that we can run GTK apps natively on Mir. He’s made lots of progress, there are a few blockers and a few bugs, but he continues to get those fixed, and that’s looking really good. You’ll be able to run GTK apps on Mir on the phone and on the Unity 8 desktop. You can do that already, but it’s getting better all the time.”

==== Will LXD Containers on Ubuntu Revolutionize Open Source Virtualization? ====

Christopher Tozzi, The VAR Guy, writes that LXC 2.0 has been released by Canonical. He says that according to Mark Shuttleworth, it has revolutionized the container market by providing a lot of various advantages that other containers don’t. Christopher explores this assertion in relation to Docker and writes: “So far, the container craze has centered mostly on Docker. But Canonical's effort to develop a different approach to containers could serve it well as enterprise adoption of container-based virtualization accelerates.”
