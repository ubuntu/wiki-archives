=== Introduction ===

Provide one-stop shopping for everything packaged in `.deb` format and create a panel for user requests then do the packaging on our own.

=== Rationale ===

Users request loads of new software and add source repositories to their `/etc/apt/sources.list`, which we have no control over:

# the used Build-Dependencies
# bug reports; and 
# the user involvement

=== Scope and Use Cases ===

==== Scope ====

* Working with third parties to improve the overall quality of their packages
* Formalize requirements for packages to be imported, similar to MOTUNew process

==== Use Cases ====

* Oliver wants to have ''marlin'', the fancy new GNOME sound editor, installed, but after one week of research, he found it isn't in Ubuntu yet.
* Jorge heard of this ''mono'' repository, which have all the nice apps the guys praise in their blogs and finally finds a way to "improve" his `/etc/apt/sources.list`

=== Implementation Plan ===

# Edit http://wiki.ubuntu.com/UniverseCandidates to have
## list of software, stating:
** name
** link to source code
** status, is one of
*** not taken care of
*** stating name of maintainer
*** resolved
  0. comments section
** veto, stating
*** package name
*** maintainer
*** rationale
** user comments
*** package name
*** name
*** rationale
# announce it on ubuntu-users@lists.ubuntu.com
# research for new
** source package repositories
** software lists, like
** <nowiki>[[http://gnomefiles.org/|GnomeFiles]]</nowiki>
** <nowiki>[[http://www.kde-apps.org/|KDE-Apps.org]]</nowiki>
** ...
# 2 weeks before release:
## start (already existing) <nowiki>[[http://ubuntu.gplan.info/apt-get.org.py|script]]</nowiki>, which will 
** check source repositories for NEW packages
** get source packages
** try to build them
** generate mail templates to source package maintainer
  0. mail package maintainers and inform them about the inclusion of the package and invite them to participate in the MOTU Team

==== Data Preservation and Migration ====

==== Packages Affected ====

==== User Interface Requirements ====

=== Outstanding Issues ===

==== UDU BOF Agenda ====

* Prioritization
* Notifying third parties when we import their packages, and inviting them to become Ubuntu members and maintainers
