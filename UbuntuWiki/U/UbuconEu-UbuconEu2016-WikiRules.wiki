__TOC__

== Wiki Rules ==

We have a pretty large team, so it is necessary to know who is responsible for Wiki pages at tasks at any time.

=== User pages ===

All team members must have a Wiki page with information on how to contact them, e.g. <nowiki>[[Sturmflut]]</nowiki>.

=== Responsibility for a Wiki page ===

All Wiki pages must have the following table at the top:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| Page Maintainer
| User1, User2, ...
|}

=== Responsibility for a Task ===

All Tasks must have the following table attached:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| Responsible
| User1, User2, ...
|-
| Due
| <date>
|-
| Progress
| <progress>
|}
