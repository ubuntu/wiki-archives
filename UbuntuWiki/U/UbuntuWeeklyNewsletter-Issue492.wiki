==== Martin Pitt: The alphabet and pitti end here: Last day at Canonical ====

Martin Pitt who has worked for Ubuntu for 12.5 years announces his departure from Canonical to achieve a "reboot". Martin reminisces about being asked to join the Ubuntu project and some memories over the years, before finally revealing he will commence work on a piece of software called Cockpit. Martin finishes by thanking the Ubuntu community, and Mark Shuttleworth.

http://www.piware.de/2016/12/last-day-at-canonical/

==== Daniel Holbach: Taking a break ====

Daniel Holbach, who has been a part of the Ubuntu community for 12 years, and employed by Canonical for 11 years, announces his departure from Canonical. Daniel says he has not made plans yet on what he will do next, just that he needs a break.

https://daniel.holba.ch/blog/2016/12/taking-a-break/

==== Dimitri John Ledkov: Swapfiles by default in Ubuntu ====

Dimitri John Ledkov writes about a change coming in 17.04 Zesty Zapus where swap partitions will be replaced by swapfiles. He notes how usage (amount of RAM, types of disks) has changed over the years, and gives us some  indication as to what the defaults in 17.04 will be.

http://blog.surgut.co.uk/2016/12/swapfiles-by-default-in-ubuntu.html

==== Leo Arias: Test a stable release update ====

Leo Arias briefly explains the Ubuntu release cycle with regards to testing and stability, with stability a prime goal. Leo then expands to "proposed" Stable Release Updates (SRU), and provides details of how you can help test them if you're willing. Leo suggests testing by using a virtual machine, providing links for more information and example commands at testing snapcraft.

http://elopio.net/blog/test-sru/

==== Leo Arias: Ubuntu Testing Day wrap up - snapcraft and beers (20161216) ====

Leo Arias summarizes the last Ubuntu Testing Day session of 2016 in which Sergio Schvezov introduced Snapcraft and showed some of the features that will shortly land in Ubuntu. He embeds a video of the session in his post, and informs us that as Snapcraft is one of the few projects that has an exception to land new features to released versions of Ubuntu there is a constant need for testing to ensure that nothing is broken for those running a stable Ubuntu.
