__TOC__

Below is an attempt to create a comprehensive list of translations, similar to the <nowiki>[[EnglishTranslation-WordSubstitution|English WordSubtitution]]</nowiki>.
You are invited to add words or sentences you believe doesn't have an obvious meaning. This way we can have more unified transltions and avoid cases in which words are being translated into different Hebrew meanings. We should discuss translations on the <nowiki>[[http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/ubuntu_he_translators/|mailing list]]</nowiki> or <nowiki>[[http://ubuntu-il.com/board/forumdisplay.php?fid=31|Forum]]</nowiki>.

If you start a thread or forum post, update the chart with the relevant word and translation.

The "Context" column indicates that the translator should be questioned prior to the change being made since the word might have multiple meanings. If it is empty, that word can be substituted without question.

If you don't find the word you are looking for on the list, you may try <nowiki>[[http://linbrew.sourceforge.net/carmel/terms.php|Carmel]]</nowiki>.
