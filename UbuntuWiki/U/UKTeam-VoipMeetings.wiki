=== Overview ===

Some members of UKTeam would like to hold audio meetings rather than or in addition to the IRC meetings we already hold. This page outlines the status of that project.

=== Plan ===

Each stage to follow the success of the previous one. The stages may be repeated after reconfiguration or problem solving where appropriate.

NOTE: Stage 1 and Stage 2 are not considered actual Ubuntu-UK LoCo team meetings. Merely tests of the infrastructure and process.

=== Progress ===

2nd April, we held global jam using mumble, and also plan to do a quiz night, using mumble. This thus is progress towards the aim, and also completion in part of that aim.   

==== Stage 1 ====

* 4 person trial of VOIP Meeting.

==== Stage 2 ====

* Invitation to the mailing list for Ubuntu-UK members to participate in a test VOIP Meeting
