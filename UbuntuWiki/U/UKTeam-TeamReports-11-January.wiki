__TOC__

* IRC meetings on the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UKTeam/MeetingNotes/20110127|27th]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[ https:--wiki.ubuntu.com-UKTeam-MeetingNotes-20110110|10th]]</nowiki>
* No podcasts - they are on a break
* Events - planning for the Open Source Expo in February
* Have been trying to persuade pcspecialist to allow testing (I offered to travel to their factory for this) on three or four selected builds.  They are considering this, but at present are reluctant.  Also am looking to do something similar with NovaTech.  At OpenSource Expo, Alan Cocks (I think it was Alan) said he has made some contacts there, and will pursue this.  Barry Drake.
* Made contact with the manager of my local Maplins to offer an Ubuntu demonstration day or evening.  The Manager phoned me back to chat, and is very interested.  Maybe similar initiatives could be tried?  Suggestions?  Barry Drake.
