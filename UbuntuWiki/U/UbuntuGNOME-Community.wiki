Are you '''new''' to Linux? No worries. We've all been there before. :)

=== Ubuntu GNOME Users ===

Users are those interested in and actively using Ubuntu GNOME. If you have been using Ubuntu GNOME or any official Ubuntu flavor, and feel familiar with the system, then you fit this category.

The purposes of this group include:

1. Identifying and organizing Ubuntu GNOME users

1. Creating opportunities to contribute to Ubuntu GNOME

Users are not required to volunteer frequent hours to supporting Ubuntu GNOME. However, we find that most users love the system and want to contribute. We welcome your enthusiasm! If you'd like to contribute, we ask for at least one hour per week.
