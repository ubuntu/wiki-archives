The post goes on to link to a page listing the following and explaining what they do.

* 1st winner: Academy by Roman Shchekin

==== Adding snaps for secure, transactional packages in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS ====

Ollie Ries introduces his post by talking about how Ubuntu has expanded into the realm of phones and Internet of Things devices and how this has required them to “solve real problems in security and reliability.” He continues by announcing “In Ubuntu 16.04 LTS we will make it possible to install snap packages alongside traditional deb packages. These two packaging formats live quite comfortably next to one another and enable us to maintain our existing processes for development and updates to the OS.”

The example is intended to simulate clusters on your machine, rather than showing how to create a production environment.
