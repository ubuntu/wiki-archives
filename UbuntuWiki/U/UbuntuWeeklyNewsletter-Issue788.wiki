==== Improvements to PPA management in 23.10 ====

Julian Andres Klode announces the release of software-properties 0.99.37, which introduces a "significant change to how PPAs are managed on Ubuntu Systems". Thanks is expressed to Nick Rosbrook (enr0n) for his hard work. With a discussion of what this change means, including the enhanced security it offers starting with Ubuntu 23.10, we're asked to 'stay tuned' for more updates and to give any feedback.
