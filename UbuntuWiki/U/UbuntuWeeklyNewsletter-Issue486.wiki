Thomas assures us that the MythTV packages in the official repositories and the Mythbuntu PPA will continue to be available and updated.

Paul White recounts work he has focused on over the past week on several laptops he had running various flavors of Ubuntu. At the end of his testing journey, he concludes: “Old hardware seems to work fine with the right flavour of Ubuntu until you push it to its limits but it's nice to know that if one Ubuntu flavour doesn't work for you then you can always try another.”
