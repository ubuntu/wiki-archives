This Ubuntu Developer Summit is going to be in Brussels, Belgium and we will have five action-packed days in which we set the goals for Ubuntu 10.10, code-named "Maverick Merkaat". The end of UDS is going to be very special, we'll have an Ubuntu Allstars Jam again.

This is how it's going to work: if you play an instrument, sing or can contribute to a jam in any way, we need you. We will kick off the planning for the event now on the mailing list of <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-allstars|The Ubuntu Allstars team]]</nowiki>. You can suggest songs and find people to play your songs with. During the week we will have a room in the evenings in which you can rehearse.

Also check out the planning wiki page at: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UDS-M/Allstars-Planning and add anything (instruments/equip) you might be bringing with you.

On the Monday of UDS week we will meet to kick off rehearsing and planning.

We will meet nightly for a jam starting at 7:30PM in the '''Cocobolo I''' Room.

This is going to be fantastic. Make sure you join the team today, help out with the planning!
