==== Topics for discussion ====
* Review our Code of Conduct draft
** Any feedbacks?
** meeting attendees said the draft one is ok.
** But since number of attendees were relatively small, there will be a poll for 1 week period.

* Sponsorship Discussion 
** Sponsorship package
** Yougnbin: According to the budget plan, most items can be paid directly by sponsor or can receive voucher/service credit/service subscription instead of cash. -> Let's consider receive sponsorship from swag makers or tell sponsors to pay swags directly.
** Yudhi: https://devopsjsconf.com/ -> in that event, attendees asked directly to sponsor to get swag/souvenir (sponsors directly paid to swag makers)
** HP: Best options would be cash sponsorship(that most events choose) with in-kind sponsorship. Fiscal host(a business, organization or individual who manages receiving and distributing fund with cash) is required to do that. FOSSASIA can offer fiscal host since it's registered organization in Sinapore.

Outcome: offer both cash and in-kind sponsorship. 
Hong Phuc offered to use FOSSASIA as a fiscal host. 
Action Item: Youngbin to check with an agency for their service cost if needed 

* Consider delegating cash management to each local team -> no longer required if we got fiscal host.
* sponsor type suggestion: global sponsors/local sponsors -> This will be discussed within sponsorship and update will be shared on next meeting.

CFS Promotion -> This will be discussed in next meeting.
* through our social media
* through each local team’s marketing channel
