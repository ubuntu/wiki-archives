She will do the opening keynote on the first day. Furthermore we're happy to have talks from Canonical employees, from other other companies like Nextcloud and Microsoft and most importantly from the wider Ubuntu-Community.” He concludes by putting a call out to the community for a venue in 2017.

==== Valorie Zimmerman: Kubuntu Alive and Thriving at KDE Akademy ====

Valorie Zimmerman writes about attending KDE Akademy in Berlin.  Meeting teams face-to-face is great, also having many teams at the one place is better. At KDE Akademy, Kubuntu e.V. also have their annual AGM. This year also had Qtcon hosted by KDAB, Qt, VideoLAN and the FSFE.  Reflecting on Kubuntu, she shares that there are more candidates than positions for the Kubuntu Council, which she sees as a healthy indicator.

==== Ubuntu App Developer Blog: Releasing the 4.1.0 Ubuntu SDK IDE ====

Benjamin Zeller and Zoltán Balogh announce the upgrade to the Ubuntu Software Development Kit (SDK) Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to most recent 4.1.0 Qt``Creator. A link to new features and fixes is provided. They share that LXD containers are used to run apps so the SDK IDE host doesn't need runtime dependencies. Commands to grab this IDE are provided.

http://developer.ubuntu.com/en/blog/2016/09/07/releasing-410-ubuntu-sdk-ide/

==== Launchpad News: Linking Git merge proposals to bugs ====

Colin Watson tells us of a new feature for Launchpad's Git repository: Git-based merge proposals can be linked to Launchpad bugs. Colin reveals the required commit text to make linking with bugs work, which is the same as for debian/changelog files. Colin notes that bugs don't automatically close, and there are differences to how Bazaar links.

==== Robert Ancell: Introducing snapd-glib ====

Robert Ancell blogs about snapd-glib; a new library for glib projects to query, install and remove Snaps. It can accessed via C, python or Vala, and a Qt/QML wrapper is coming. Snapd uses the REST API, which snapd-glib closely matches. Robert provides sample code that will show you how to have your apps integrate Snap support.

http://bobthegnome.blogspot.com/2016/08/introducing-snapd-glib.html

==== Ted Gould: Click Hooks ====

Ted Gould gives us the reasons as to why he likes Click hooks. Ted outlines the history for his post, what hooks are, including filesystem hooks. Ted tells us Click hooks work, including how they can help find bugs. Whilst the design may feel wrong at first, it'll fall into place after you create some hooks.

==== Ubuntu GNOME: Ubuntu GNOME 16.10 wallpaper contest winners ====

Alfredo Hernández shares the winners of the 16.10 wallpaper contest, with links to all the wallpapers. He also writes: “The team would like to thank all the gorgeous photographs and digital art that have been submitted to the contest” and shares some alterations to the rules for the next contest.

==== Ubuntu 16.04 kisses the cloud, disses the desktop ====

Tom Henderson of Network World evaluates the latest Ubuntu release, 16.04. He is critical of the lack of changes on the desktop, but does talk about the new Snap package format. Most of his article dives into increased support on what is more traditionally thought of as the server and cloud side of Ubuntu, including ZFS, Ceph, LXC and Open``Stack.

==== Intel Graphics Update Tool Adds Support for Ubuntu 16.04 ====

==== This drone kit doubles as a Ubuntu Linux PC ====

Agam Shah writes for PC World in this article about Parrot’s S.L.A.M.dunk, “a development kit that runs on Ubuntu and the Robot Operating System and can be used to make auxiliary devices for drones.” He provides some of the specs of the hardware included and notes that pricing has yet to be announced, and shipping of these kits should happen in the fourth quarter of this year.

==== Tesla Autopilot 2.0 Capabilities Demoed With Ubuntu ====

In spite of his own lack of interest in cars, Joey Elijah Sneddon of OMG! Ubuntu! shares a video from a Tesla test drive. He writes, “The German electronics company Bosch supplies Tesla’s radar equipment, and has its own autonomous vehicle program based on the Tesla Model S so that it can test its systems.” and goes on before the video link to say “Ubuntu fans may be more interested in the OS that’s used to help test it…”
