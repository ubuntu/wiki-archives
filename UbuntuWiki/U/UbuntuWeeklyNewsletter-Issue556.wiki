Alan Griffiths writes about Mir 1.1, and that all intended features have landed, and with only some housekeeping to be done, it should get released in days. Alan updates us on Experimental X11 support using it as a chance to seek a fresh developer. Next we are told about Nvidia support and that EGLStream support has landed in Mir with some limitations, then told about the MATE migration to Mir status, before finishing up on the egmde desktop snap which now runs on Fedora and Arch.

A video link is provided if you want to see it in action, but William is working with MATE devs in bug-chasing and to get initial Wayland support landed in master. Work on it continues, but as it will cause an API break, a merge is currently on hold.

==== Mir News: 7th of December 2018 ====

William Wold (wmww) advises he continues polishing MATE panel on Mir and chasing other minor bugs in Mir.

William concludes the update with the good news that "These are the last few issues we need to resolve before Mir 1.1.".

As Launchpad already supports Git, Balint suggests projects move to Git when possible, with links provided which should help in the task, or for more details.
