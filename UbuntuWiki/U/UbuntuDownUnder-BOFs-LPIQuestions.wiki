=== Introduction ===

This BOF will solicit suggestions for Debian related questions to be included on the LPI exams.  Mark Miller (LPI) will lead the discussion.

'''Note:''' We want as many people as possible to participate in this, but in order to do so you must either be (a) LPI certified or (b) very experienced/senior and willing to waive your right to ever seek an LPI certification (because you'll know the answers already!).

=== Rationale ===

This discussion will help build our understanding of the LPI tests and therefore aid in the development of an LPI-based Ubuntu certification.

=== Scope and Use Cases ===

=== Implementation Plan ===

==== Data Preservation and Migration ====

==== Packages Affected ====

==== User Interface Requirements ====

=== Outstanding Issues ===
