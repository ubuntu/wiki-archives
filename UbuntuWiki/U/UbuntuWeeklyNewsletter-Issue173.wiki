=== General Community News ===

==== Mark Shuttleworth: My new focus at Canonical ====

From March next year, I’ll focus my Canonical energy on product design, partnerships and customers. Those are the areas that I enjoy most and also the areas where I can best shape the impact we have on open source and the technology market. I’m able to do this because Jane Silber, who has been COO at Canonical virtually from the beginning, will take on the job of CEO.

Since Jane joined the company, she and I have shared the load of coordinating between the leaders of all the key teams that make up Canonical. We’ve been through various permutations as new initiatives needed different kinds of attention; Jane currently leads the Ubuntu One effort, for example.

I’ve become very passionate about design and quality, and want to spend more time figuring out how we harness the collaborative process to build better, more insightful products. I can’t think of a more interesting challenge, and luckily I couldn’t think of a better person to take over my formal management and leadership responsibilities at Canonical than Jane. We’ve worked together long enough, and closely enough, that I can be confident of continuity in the pieces I most care about and also excited about the ways in which I think Jane will raise the bar for the senior team. As a former VP at General Dynamics, Jane has more experience of large customers and large organizational leadership, which I see as essential for Canonical over the next five years. We are being welcomed as a partner and supplier to ever-larger businesses, and I want to make sure we are a robust answer to their needs.

Many folks in the community will know Jane from Ubuntu Developer Summits, and of course she’s well established as a leader at Canonical. In order to focus on the new role, we’ll be hiring for a COO and a new lead for Ubuntu One (both positions will be advertised publicly as well as within Canonical). There’s no rush, so we plan to coordinate things carefully and I expect I’ll be focused on my new role by March.

==== Lucid Community Team Plans ====

Jono Bacon and his horsemen are planning some major community actions for Lucid. They have put together a strategy to help guide and improve some of the community teams for the Lucid cycle. While Jono's team doesn't encompass all the strategic blueprints for Lucid it is a fitting start to the cycle. Blueprints of the different areas that have been highlighted by the team include:

* Upstreams
* Developers
* Governance Support
* Translations
* Lo``Co Teams
* Governance Changes
* Regular Cycle Activities
* Infrastructure

You can see more detailed information at the link below concerning each of the above listed areas marked for improvement during the Lucid cycle.

==== Michal Zajac (quintasan) Interview ====

Michal is 16 years old and lives in Lubin, Poland. He has been using Linux for about 3 years, and has gone from Ubuntu to Kubuntu to Gentoo and now back to Kubuntu. Michal first got involved with MOTU by translating, but quickly moved on to more serious contributions. You can also find Michal contributing in the #ubuntu-pl IRC channel helping out the Polish Lo``Co team. For Lucid, he plans to keep working with the Kubuntu Ninjas to help bring everyone a new KDE SC releases. In his spare time, Michal loves to skateboard, learn Japanese, and he has recently started learning C++.

=== LoCo News ===

==== New update coming for the Ubuntu Israeli website ====

The ubuntu-il Lo``Co has decided to do a makeover of their Lo``Co website. They plan to use more content from the ubuntu.com webpage to help the team promote Ubuntu on a more consistent basis. Since they use RTL language, they can't just do a copy and paste, so rebuilding all the pages will take some time. In the end they will have a complete remake with everything in Hebrew, and possible some site availability for the blind. Sounds like an ambitious undertaking that the Ubuntu community can look forward to seeing.

=== Launchpad News ===

==== James Westby: Ubuntu Distributed Development Overview ====

* Better patch tracking and more in Launchpad Bugs 3.1.12

Launchpad’s 3.1.12 release has been a big release for the Launchpad Bugs team, despite it only being a two week development cycle compared to the normal four week cycle for Launchpad releases.  This meant there was really only a week of development time for the bugs team.  We’ve been anxious to really put some development effort to the plans we’ve been articulating at sprints and UDS over the last few weeks prior to the start of the 3.1.12 cycle, so we discussed in our team being very careful with our time during this short cycle so that we could end the year with a hint of the work to come over the next 2-3 months.

One of the things we’ll be working on over the next months is better patch tracking and reporting in Launchpad.  The first fruits of this have landed with changes to distinguish patches in comments and to list patches separately on the bug page.

Now when you attach a patch to a Launchpad bug, the patch has a new icon to distinguish it from any other attachment.

==== Canonical Continues Ubuntu Server Edition Push ====

The VAR Guy says that Ubuntu is more than a desktop operating system, and that continues to be the message from Canonical, which is promoting another Ubuntu Server Edition user survey in a bid to better understand how customers are deploying the server operating system. Canonical has spent much of 2009 launching more training programs and ISV efforts for Ubuntu Server Edition. The initiatives have even included cloud training. At the same time, Canonical has been evolving Landscape — its systems management platform for Ubuntu desktops and servers. The VAR Guy senses that Canonical is making progress with Ubuntu Server Edition, but big questions remain: How many customers actually pay Canonical for Ubuntu Server Edition support? How many customers are starting to deploy Ubuntu in public and private clouds? And will Lucid Lynx live up to its server promise?

==== Mark Shuttleworth To Step Down From CEO Role ====

Phoronix's Michael Larabel reports that Mark Shuttleworth has just announced this morning via a blog post that he will be stepping down as the CEO of Canonical, the formal company behind Ubuntu Linux. Jane Silber, the current COO of Canonical, will be taking over Mark's position as the CEO. Mark Shuttleworth though will not be leaving Canonical, but rather he wishes to focus more of his time on bettering Ubuntu and its products rather than the formal business responsibilities. From his blog post, "I've become very passionate about design and quality, and want to spend more time figuring out how we harness the collaborative process to build better, more insightful products." Shuttleworth will be formally stepping down as the Chief Executive Officer in March when Jane Silber takes over.

==== Ubuntu 10.04 Already Shortens The Boot Time ====

Michael Larabel of Phoronix states that Ubuntu 10.04 Alpha 1 was released last week and while it did not bring any major features yet for this Long-Term Support release, it began to introduce some underlying changes like the switch to the Linux 2.6.32 kernel, X Server 1.7, and the complete removal of HAL. Larabel's early benchmarks of Ubuntu 10.04 show that there are some negative performance
regressions right off the bat, but one area that Canonical is focusing upon in particular with Ubuntu 10.04 LTS is speeding up the boot process. Also surfacing this month is a new kernel that pulls in more of Intel's Moblin speed patches from their kernel. As most know, Moblin 2 boots extremely fast. Phoronix has tested out this kernel with the Moblin patches on Ubuntu 9.10 and it booted three seconds faster compared to the stock Karmic kernel.

==== Ubuntu 10.04 will bring panel overhaul, social network menu ====

Ryan Paul of ARS Technica notes that Canonical has lifted the curtains on some ambitious plans to reinvent the GNOME panel. The changes, which could potentially debut in the next major version of Ubuntu, will help simplify the desktop user experience and clean up superfluous panel clutter. Canonical has been working on an incremental panel overhaul under the umbrella of its Ayatana desktop enhancement initiative. The company introduced a number of experimental changes to the GNOME panel in previous versions of Ubuntu, and Ubuntu 10.04, which is scheduled for release in April, will take this tinkering to the next level with a more holistic overhaul. Part of Canonical's grand plan for panel perfection is a concept that the company calls the Me Menu. Based partly on Ubuntu's current presence applet, the new Me Menu will serve as a one-stop shop for configuring messaging status and social networks. Designed by Ubuntu founder Mark Shuttleworth himself, the Me Menu is expected to be one of the highlights of Ubuntu 10.04.

==== Ubuntu, Linux, GNOME and Xorg: This Intel-video user is tired ====

Inside So Cal's Steven Rosenberg tells us that he has been reading one of his favorite FOSS writers, Ryan Paul, and one comment leapt right out at him: "I'm looking forward to this release. 9.10 is mostly stable, I could use a good update that breaks my intel video and wireless chips even though they were fine, plus overhauls the USB method so not much works anymore." Rosenberg says he had a pretty good thing going in Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. Rosenberg goes on to say that he did the upgrade from 8.04 through 8.10 to 9.04 in a single weekend solely to be ready for 9.10, and he had no idea so many things would break. "All I want are upgrades that don't completely break the OS. That's it. I like new apps, but what happened to this Toshiba Satellite 1100-S101 with Ubuntu 9.10 is not OK." Rosenberg says that come Lucid time in April of next year, the way he feels now he's not going there in any kind of rush. "Maybe three months, maybe more ... maybe not."

==== Ubuntu's Lucid plans ====

Alastair Otter of My Broadband states that in April the Ubuntu developers will release Lucid Lynx. Also known as Ubuntu 10.04, Lucid Lynx will be the third long term support (LTS) release from Ubuntu and is likely to have a strong focus on stability and security and will be geared at appealing to enterprise users and hardware makers. Speaking in September, when he first announced Lucid Lynx, Ubuntu chief Mark Shuttleworth said that the developers would be "taking the large scale, horizontal scalability, volume deployment, heritage of Debian and really try to push that into cloud computing. Making sure that 10.04 is a platform for anybody who is building a large scale infrastructure - for anybody who is trying to build the next Facebook, the next Google, the next eBay. Whether you want to start on (Amazon) EC2 and migrate to the managed cloud, Ubuntu 10.0.4 is going to be the platform."

==== Canonical’s Shuttleworth: We’ll Have New CEO In 2010 ====

WorkWithU bloggers Christopher Tozzi  and Joe Panettieri have both been busy this week reporting on Mark Shuttleworth's announcement that he will be stepping down as Canonical's CEO and stepping up into that role will be Jane Silber currently the COO for Canonical. Panettieri asks, "Mark Shuttleworth’s Next Ubuntu Move?" [1] Computerworld Blogger, Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols  writes and great summary of this announcement on his blog posts [2] as well.  These 4 posts are tip of the discussions that are happening throughout the Ubuntu Community.  Each article linking to the Shuttleworth's original announcement, and the Canonical Blog as well as several other insightful articles.  As Tozzi states in his article, "it’s worth mentioning that putting a female in charge of Canonical is a great move..."[3] and Vaughan-Nichols states "So much for the business side, but what about Shuttleworth as head cheerleader and leader of Ubuntu? You don't need to worry about that. As he said with a laugh yesterday in a press conference, he's still the "self-appointed benevolent dictator for life" of Ubuntu. "It's a life sentence and I remain undaunted and that remains unchanged.""[4]  Want to know more about what's in store for Canonical in 2010 take a moment to read each of these articles and join in on the exciting discussions happening all over the net.

==== First Look at Ubuntu 10.04 Alpha 1 ====

Tom Dryer, Tombuntu,  takes a look at Ubuntu 10.04, Lucid Lynx Alpha 1 on his Eee PC 901 netbook.  He notes the the differences on what he saw immediately after the install and then notes some of the changes he noticed from 9.10 these included:
* The touchpad defaulted to “edge scrolling” instead of “two-finger scrolling” but it was easy to change this setting.
* Notification bubbles seem to be drawn in a debug mode.
* Ubuntu Software Center uses a nice new animated breadcrumb control.
* Bootup seems to be a bit faster than 9.10. A transition from usplash/xsplash to plymouth/xsplash is taking place, so the boot experience could change soon.
* A few changes are planned for the default software selection, but most have not been made yet. GIMP will be dropped, a video editor will be added, and a smaller selection of games will be available.
Take a look at the screen shots and see if your Lucid Lynx Alpha 1 experience is like Dryer's.

==== So a Man Walks Into a Bar and Asks for an Ubuntu on the Rocks ====

In an article Posted by Daengbo on the "I' been to ubuntu" site, in this tongue-in-cheek article, set in IT Square of Bangkok, Thailand, the discussion centers on how the narrator of this dialogue and his girl friend are looking at computers.  All but 2 have Ubuntu or an Linux OS on them.  The Clerk even smiles at them and says, ""But we can install Linux on those two for you if you prefer," the clerk added with a smile. "It's Open Source."" The narrator notes that six years ago they had Linux computers on display but the salespeople didn't know about it, fast forward today and they are willing to install it for people if they prefer. "My, how times have changed!"

==== My kid will, in fact, do it with Ubuntu (and other 2010 predictions) ====

Christopher Dawson, with ZDNet, makes 6 predications for his kid and other educational items for 2010.

** Prediction #1: My kid will do it with Ubuntu

** Prediction #2: My kid will also do it with Windows 7, Chrome OS, Windows Vista, OS X, and Android.

** Prediction #3: Like it or not, social media will come to education

** Prediction #4: Labs of traditional desktop PCs will not survive

** Prediction #5: 1:1 will be a reality, but not the way you think

** Prediction #6:  Student data will be widely accessible, integrated with all critical systems, and interchangeable among institutions

Dawson goes into specifics for each of these predictions.  Bringing up some points worth pondering.  Concerned about how kids will be using Ubuntu and how Education will be using Ubuntu and Open Source then check out Dawson's article and see if you agree or disagree with these predictions. Dawson concludes with this point to ponder, "It can work and it should work. The question is will it work and, if so, when?"

==== Pushing Prism on Ubuntu ====

Christopher Tozzi, WorksWithU, discusses one of Ubuntu's most useful features - one-click installation of webapps via Mozilla's Prism.  In this article Tozzi, looks at why he thinks Canonical should work harder to push features like these.  "In Mozilla’s words, “Prism is an application that lets users split Web applications out of their browser and run them directly on their desktop.”  In practical terms, that means you can have individual browser windows dedicated to specific Web applications–like Gmail, Facebook or Twitter–without having to worry about them becoming mixed up with your other Firefox tabs or needing to be restarted if you restart your browser."  Tozzi goes on to discuss why this matters and what it means for Ubuntu Users.  "The fusion of the traditional desktop with services hosted remotely is the future, and Ubuntu’s packages for Prism are a great example of how convenient that development can be for users.  But the users need to know about it first."

==== Setting up Ubuntu 9.10 ====

Tom Dryer, Tombuntu, discusses setting up Ubuntu 9,10. Dryer discusses how he set up custom partitions, changed the theme, installing drivers, getting Compiz running, using Chrome, and installing Ubuntu Restricted Extras among other things.  Dryer also installed GNOME Do, and added the new Wine PPA. He even talks using the gmail notifier and Indicator Applet.  Thinking about setting up Ubuntu 9.10 take a look at Dryer's article.

=== In Other News ===

==== Ubuntu's Jono Bacon: Managing an Open Source Community ====

Bruce Byfield of Datamation reminds us that for the past three years, Jono Bacon has worked as community manager for Ubuntu, one of the largest and most diverse projects in open source software. Consequently, when he recently published his thoughts on building and managing communities, people listen. More unusually, as Byfield found out in a recent interview, when people like him critique Bacon's book, he listens, too, with a view to improving the second edition. "To me, this is the first part of the story," Bacon says. "The first part's going to have holes in it where it doesn't quite fit the needs of most people, but the second edition will be the part that's really interesting." Whether a second edition is eventually released is still uncertain -- and will be for at least a year, according to Bacon -- but that does not change the importance of the conversations it is beginning to start. Those conversations alone make The Art of Community, faults and all, one of the more significant books about free software that has been released.

==== Cloud-oriented netbook distro arrives in beta ====

Linux``Devices.com's Eric Brown tells us that Jolicloud released a public beta of its Ubuntu-based, cloud-oriented Jolicloud Linux distribution for netbooks. The free, open source distro offers fast boot-ups, a netbook-optimized interface, and Intel GMA500 graphics support, while running both web-based and native Linux apps. The distribution offers both Firefox 3.5.3 and Prism 1.0b2 browsers, and supports a wide variety of wireless protocols, as well as audio and video formats. Jolicloud founder and CEO Tariq Krim, "Traditional operating systems find their roots in the late seventies and are built around software. But today, 90 percent of our computing life is on the Web. Jolicloud was built with Web users in mind."
