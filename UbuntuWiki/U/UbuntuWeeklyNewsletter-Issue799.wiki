==== Jammy Jellyfish (22.04.3 LTS) Point-Release Status Tracking ====

Paride Legovini has posted the Ubuntu 22.04.3 Point-Release tracking document which is due for release on 10 August 2023. This post shows the current status, with links for more details.

https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/jammy-jellyfish-22-04-3-lts-point-release-status-tracking/37439

==== Event Report: Sparking the Community at KDE Akademy ====

Philipp Kewisch writes a report about KDE Akademy held 15-21 July 2023 in Thessaloniki Greece, which continues on from a prior blog about it. This report informs us of the "experience there and what was achieved". We're told of many talks including how this detail can be useful for Ubuntu, the Ubuntu booth, Lo``Cos and developments and to those who have an interest in these.

https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/event-report-sparking-the-community-at-kde-akademy/37449

==== Ubuntu Kernel 4/2 SRU Cycle Announcement ====

Kleber Souza starts by giving examples of how the 3-week Kernel SRU cycle is "prone to interruptions", which can cause a cycle to be extended. To improve "kernel SRU release cadence velocity and predictability, the Canonical Kernel Team is transitioning from the 3-week cycle to a new 4/2 Kernel SRU Cycle". This post tells us why, and what this will mean, and includes a time-diagram to stress the point. We're told OEM kernels will have a "more flexible schedule", and given links if we require more details.

==== PSA: Retiring the `latest` tracks for ubuntu-frame*, graphics- and mir-test-tools (action required) ====

Michał Sawicz discusses Ubuntu Frame and the desire to have it supported as long as the 'underlying Ubuntu release' - noting that the toolchains and dependencies require update during that time. This led to the 'tracks' introduction. What follows should be read by users of ubuntu-frame, ubuntu-frame-osk, ubuntu-frame-vnc, mir-test-tools, & graphics-test-tools, in order to ensure you understand the 'tracks' concept and correct usage.

==== Ubuntu Minotaur Wallpaper Competition open ====

Aaron Prisk announces the Ubuntu 23.10 (Mantic Minotaur) Wallpaper Competition. We're introduced to the competition, given the rules, and told entries can go on this thread.

==== UbuCon Asia X LibreOffice Conf Asia 2023 - CFP Closed, Tickets now available ====

==== Libera.​Chat: Temporarily disabling the Matrix Bridge ====

This update from Allie and el continues from prior blogs about the change of connections between Libera.Chat and the Matrix bridge; which has transitioned from portalled channel access to an opt-in plumbed channel approach. Due to security concerns, we're told that Libera.Chat requested the change in order to "protect our users", with the bridge to be removed Saturday 5 August 2023 1400 UTC. It is currently unknown when the security issues will be resolved and a return to service. More to come as known.

==== GNOME project considers adding window tiling by default ====

Liam Proven writes about the recent blog from Tobias Bernard (see UWN issue 798) which introduces us to the idea of automatic window tiling in the GNOME Desktop. This article discusses it further, and contrasts with System 76's COSMIC Desktop, and reminds users of other desktops they too can have some of this (eg. KDE Plasma 5.27 has 'advanced tiling support', as did Ubuntu Unity's desktop from 2013).

We're given some details of these changes, including a quote from Mario Limonciello of AMD's Linux client team, and given clues on devices it may help. A note is made that some Intel systems could "potentially" regress with these changes, thus it's not mainlined.

==== Ubuntu Portugal Podcast: Episode 258 - Fora de Fase ====

"Este podcast chega-vos através de electrões que circulam na rede, saltitando de um lado para o outro, à velocidade da luz. Todos? Não. Alguns electrões com mais vagar ficam para trás e emitem um pequeno murmúrio, muito baixinho: "vão andando, que eu já lá vou ter…". Foram esses electrões que nos ajudaram a fazer este episódio, com grande desfasamento, em que falámos de mistérios de ipv6, upnp, llm, ssd por usb, PrivacyLX, GIMP, Inkscape, hdmi, h4, cmd, vpn e outros acrónimos enigmáticos."
