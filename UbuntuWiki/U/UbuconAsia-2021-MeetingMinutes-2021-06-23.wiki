==== Action items from last meeting ====
* Gunyoung, Gyuseok, Youngbin: Try to open US paypal and test sending small amounts of money to other paypal accounts. 
*** First in korean paypal account is cannot transfer money to another korean account so i test korean account to us account making us account is passable but need us phone number but some app support to use US phone number so I can make US account but when korean send money to US account US account cannot receive money before enter SSN number. So send money (kr -> kr) = x (kr -> us) = passable but need SSN. So even if we got a US personal paypal account, We can't accept donations if we don't have a US Social Security Number.
