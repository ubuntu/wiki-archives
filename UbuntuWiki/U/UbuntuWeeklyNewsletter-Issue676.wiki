==== Ubuntu Figuring Out Whether To FSCK Its File-Systems At Boot ====

Michael Larabel writes that Ubuntu developers are working on fsck at boot time. As it turns out Ubuntu Server and "installations making use of their Curtin installation component" don't currently execute fsck on boot and that is now being re-visited. With some history on the issue, including links to some bugs that have sat dormant a few years but have now been picked up by Ubuntu developers, the issue is being discussed. Many links are provided, including that of Michael Hudson Doyle's discourse thread started for the discussion.
