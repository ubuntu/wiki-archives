== Tasks to be completed for Lucid ==

There are several tasks that need to be either completed, or have continuous maintenance for Lucid and beyond. This page attempts to list these tasks, and who they are assigned to. Feel free to add to this list if you have any more tasks that you think need addressing.

==== Recurring Tasks across all development cycles ====

|-
| '''Task'''
| '''Description'''
| '''Assignee'''
|-
| <nowiki>[[UbuntuStudio-TaskMaintainRealtimeKernelPackage|Maintain realtime kernel package]]</nowiki>
| This is on a best effort basis, since the realtime patches often lag behind the latest kernel upstream release, as well as the Ubuntu kernel release.
| LukeYelavich
|-
| <nowiki>[[UbuntuStudio-TaskDVDTesting|DVD Testing]]</nowiki>
| Testing alpha images at a minimum, testing one or two dailies a week would be preferable.
| <nowiki>[[stochastic|Eric Hedekar]]</nowiki>
|-
| <nowiki>[[UbuntuStudio-TaskMetaPackageContentsSelection|Audio-Video-Graphics package selection]]</nowiki>
| We need to review what we currently ship, and see if there is anything else that needs replacing with something better, removed, or kept.
| 
|-
| <nowiki>[[UbuntuStudio-TaskRecruiting|Recruiting more helpers]]</nowiki>
| This will always be ongoing, but its listed here as it needs to be done.
| 
|-
| <nowiki>[[UbuntuStudio-TaskUpstreamPackageUpdates|Application update monitoring]]</nowiki>
| We need to know if there any applications that need updating to a new upstream release either from Debian, or upstream directly. Best to talk to the Debian maintainer if there is one to see how soon Debian can be updated. If a package is not updated in Debian by the end of July, we need to consider updating it directly in Ubuntu.
| 
|-
| <nowiki>[[UbuntuStudio-TaskDocumentationMaintenance|Documentation maintenance and co-ordination]]</nowiki>
| Generally a community effort, but it's fallen by the wayside and is an easy way for anyone to help.
