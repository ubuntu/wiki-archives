==== Ubuntu Free Culture Showcase calls all artists to contribute to next version of Ubuntu ====

Free Culture Showcase to celebrate 'Art in the Open' bringing contributors' work to millions.

The showcase will offer artists, photographers, and musicians of every background the opportunity to have their work ship with Ubuntu 10.10, the popular Linux-based operating system available in October 2010.

'Art in the Open' will expose winning contributors' work to millions of users worldwide and is a demonstration of the energy, quality and power of the open culture.

"We are committed to the idea of 'Art in the Open' at Ubuntu," said Ivanka Majic, head of design at Canonical. "The work we do in an open environment delivers the same quality as closed ones and we believe will be even more successful through tapping into this wide world of volunteer contribution."

The Free Culture Showcase looks to reach beyond what is commonly perceived as the Open Source community. Artists and creatives who may never have been part of an open project before are encouraged to contribute. Winning work will be featured with the contributors' name and all work contributed will be covered by a Creative Commons license.

"We want graphic designers, musicians, photographers and creatives of every stripe to feel they have a place in the Ubuntu project," continued Majic. "Very often without being employed by a vendor, they cannot meaningfully contribute to the tools they use or the OS they consume. With Ubuntu and Open source, we hope they realise that it is different and that difference is important."

Ubuntu Free Culture Showcase calls all artists to contribute to next version of Ubuntu

To read more about this Showcase as well as the details on how you can contribute go to:

==== Operation Cleansweep: We Need You! ====

One of the most critical components in any flourishing community is to ensure contributions that are offered in good faith are fairly reviewed in a timely manner. Unfortunately, the success of Ubuntu has resulted in more contributions than we have had time to review, and Nigel Babu is leading the way to encourage the community to review these outstanding patches.

This is important and worthwhile work, and I am really keen to encourage you all to get involved.

How do you get involved? Simple:

 1. Read the Operation cleansweep wiki page to get an idea of what we are trying to do.
 2. Read our Reviewers Guide that explains the process of how you review a patch.
 3. Pick a patch from this list to review.
 4. Review it and provide feedback.
 5. Join #ubuntu-reviewers to ask for help.

To do this you don’t have to be programmer, you don’t have to have a degree in rocket science, and you don’t have to like metal. The only requirement is that you have the desire to make Ubuntu better, and if you are reading this, you clearly have that.

Thanks in advance to everyone who helps!

==== Ubuntu Accessibility Team Personas Survey ====

One of the goals identified for the Ubuntu Accessibility Team for this cycle is to create personas that can be used by designers and developers to get them thinking about accessibility. Personas are fictional people created to give designers and developers a face and personality to consider when working. Personas just make it a little more personal rather than just concepts.

To help researching all the various accessibility needs of users, we’ve created a survey about how people with disabilities of all types use their computers. Now we need as many people as possible to fill it out. We really want to get feedback from as many different types of disabilities so we can figure out what best suits users as far as needs and where the major problems may lie. We don’t just want to hear from Ubuntu users, but everyone.

The survey can be found at two places:

 1. On a wordpress blog with text boxes. This can be filled out completely anonymously (no e-mail required or anything): http://access.libertus.co.uk
 2. On a wiki page that can be e-mailed to the e-mail address provided. This version also has some more background information on what we’re doing:https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Accessibility/Personas/Survey

If anyone has any questions or anything, please feel free to leave them here or you can e-mail ubuntu.accessibility.survey@gmail.com if you don’t want to ask publicly.

Also, please let me know if you have an access problem with both versions of the survey as I really don’t want anyone barred from taking it due to not being able to access it. We were able to test with a screen reader, but I know we don’t have things like variable text sizes or the ability to play with the colours of the sites.
We’re hoping to gather the responses we need by August 8th.

==== ISO testers for the Hall of Fame ====

Ara Pulido, of the Canonical QA team announces ISO Testers Hall of Fame.

I am glad to announce that, starting in the Maverick Alpha 3 ISO testing cycle, the activity of the ISO tracker will be reflected in the Ubuntu Hall Of Fame.

Actually, and as a beta of the new feature, you can now check the ISO Alpha 2 heroes at the Ubuntu Hall Of Fame under “Top ISO Testers”. If you are wondering why you are not there and you helped during Maverick Alpha 2 ISO testing, I will try to explain why.
The ISO tracker and Launchpad are not connected, but we need to use the Launchpad ID in the Hall Of Fame to get some other user information. Fortunately there is a Launchpad ID field in your ISO tracker user profile.

So, if you want your awesomeness to be reflected in the Hall Of Fame, please, update your profile in the ISO tracker and fill your correct Launchpad ID.

For more information on this go to :

=== LoCo News ===

==== Rocking The LoCo Council ====

I just wanted to take a moment to highlight the incredible work going on with the Ubuntu Lo``Co Council who are working hard to govern the Lo``Co community and ensure everything is running smoothly.

The Lo``Co Council has two key IRC events in each month that everyone is welcome to attend:

Lo``Co Council monthly IRC meeting – on the 3rd Tuesday of the month in #ubuntu-meeting. See the agenda

Lo``Co Health Check – 1st Tuesday of the month in #ubuntu-locoteams – an informal meeting where anyone can add a topic to discuss and get some council feedback – see this page for more details.

…and of course, the Lo``Co council are always available in #ubuntu-locoteams.

Finally, when tweeting about Ubuntu Lo``Co teams, don’t forget to use the #locoteams tag.

Keep up the great work, folks!

==== Ubuntu: a computer operating system built around community ====

Terry Lavender of the Vancouver Observer, discusses Ubuntu and the community that supports and surrounds it in this article.  Lavender discusses a little about the history of both Linux and Ubuntu in his introduction.

Further into this article Lavender talks to Randall Ross and others of the Vancouver Lo``Co Team.  This article covers many aspects of the Ubuntu community through the eyes of some very active community members.  One of the things Ross points out in this article is -  “Ubuntu includes one profoundly important component that no other operating system has: Community. The Ubuntu community is diverse, lively, and fun to be around. The Ubuntu community is real and local.”

Want to find out more about what Ross and others had to say about Ubuntu and the community go to:

==== Ubuntu Chicago Bike Tour ====

In this post by Richard Johnson of the Ubuntu Chicago Team, he invites other team members to join them in its first ever group ride.  Initiatives such as a group bike ride, organized by Lo``Co teams are just one more way to bring teams together by combining hobbies and sharing Ubuntu.

To find out more about this event that was held on July 18th, 2010 or if you are in the Chicago area and want to get involved in this Lo``Co team go to:

http://blog.nixternal.com/2010.07.13/ubuntu-chicago-bike-ride/

==== The Early-Summer LoCo BBQ at hutchnate's house was a tasty success! ====

This past Saturday, July 10th the Arizona Lo``Co team held a BBQ and a Lo``Co members home.  This was a loosely organized and last minute event but it was noted in the article that everyone had a very tasty good time. Which is just another example of how Lo``Co meetups don't have to be big production organization to be successful.

==== Ubuntu Honduras LoCo Team Wakes up ====

Ubuntu Honduras leaves its hibernation time!

As it is customary in the community that these months of May and June we always put in standby mode. But it is time that the community wakes up and get ready for the battle:)

We did a Pizza Bash. They were three hours in which we were talking, eating, telling jokes, among other things. We have set a short and long term goal. Ubuntu Honduras Loco Team will start to gives classes about the use of the Ubuntu OS in a program name IHER (Honduran Institute Education by Radio) which is thought to give a beginner level course, which it will 8 hours. In this way people will be having the knowledge about using the Ubuntu OS. The idea is that if this workshop is all right, opens through to the next level and so on.

Then within two to three weeks we will be informing!

=== Launchpad News ===

==== Launchpad EPIC 2010 photo ====

The Launchpad and Bazaar teams have been in Prague this week. The noted they would be posting more about what they have gotten done at a later daye but did manage to take a picture.

==== Showing first/last 40 comments in Launchpad ====

Bryce Harrington posts a change he made Launchpad concerning displaying the bug page.

When a launchpad bug gets a lot of comments, displaying the bug page can take a long time. To mitigate this, Launchpad only shows the first 80 comments in such a case. But often what you actually want to see is the *recent* activity. So to get that you have to go through an additional page load, which is annoying.

To fix this, I've landed a change to bugs.edge.launchpad.net today which displays the first 40 and last 40 comments. As an example, see bug 541511.

I changed the comment/activity display algorithm a little bit in order to do this, which as a side effect improves the performance a very slight amount (about 1-2% faster for highly commented bugs).

To learn more about Bryce and these changes go to:

==== Three tips for faster launchpadlib api clients ====

Martin Pool posts, three tips from Leonard’s lightning talk in Prague about writing faster Launchpadlib API clients:

 1. Use the latest launchpadlib. It gets faster from one release to the next. (The versions in the current Ubuntu release should be fine; otherwise run from the branch or the latest tarball.)
 2. Profile:
     import httplib2
     httplib2.debuglevel = 1
 will show each http request and response, so that you can see what’s taking time.
 3. Fetch objects only once:
Don’t do this:
    if bug.person is not None:
        print bug.person.name
instead
    p = bug.person
    if p is not None:
        print p.name
In the first case, the client may fetch the Person object twice. (We may fix this in future.)

==== Benjamin Humphrey: Ubuntu Manual Project core philosophy ====

Benjamin Humphrey from the Ubuntu Manual Project talks about the core philosphy for the Ubuntu Manual Project.  Over the course of several weeks, Kevin, Ilya, Thorsten and Benjamin developed ten principles that the project stands for. This list will be displayed on their new website which is being finished off to fit within the new Ubuntu project guidelines and branding.  These values include "success of our users is the ultimate goal", "research, do not guess", and "satisfy our target audience’s diverse needs" to name a few.

==== Dustin Kirkland: Man Your Browser ====

As he's spending more time on smaller laptops and netbooks, Dustin has been falling in love with Chromium web browser.  After taking a little time to learn the ins and outs, he's replaced all of the functionality he needed from Firefox and more.  He feels the most useful feature is Chromium's custom "search engines". He has a video that demonstrates adding a custom manpages.ubuntu.com to Chromium's search engines, such that you can type something like "man kvm" in your browser's URL bar, and go straight to the HTML rendering of the kvm manpage!

==== Is Chrome OS a Threat to Ubuntu or Windows? ====

Matt Harley of IT Management looks at whether Chrome OS is a threat to Ubuntu or Windows.  He opens his article with a very bold statement, "Since late 2009, talk of how Google's Chrome OS is being positioned to "take on" Microsoft Windows has been promoted by individuals who I believe have no idea what they're talking about."

Harley goes on to say, "By Google's own admission, Chrome OS is being designed for near exclusive use on netbook computers, due to its minimalist nature. And as we know, netbooks make up a small piece of the collective PC market. This clearly leaves out of desktops and laptops, which will remain dominated by the Windows OS (near term, at least).

This leads us to consider that Microsoft's Windows OS is not the target for Google after all. So the next line of thought leads us to wonder if perhaps Chrome OS is being created to take on something closer to its own design – for instance,Ubuntu Linux?"

Harley breaks the article up into the following areas of discussion:

* Is Chrome OS Linux or not?
* Chrome OS isn't competing with Windows
* Will Chrome OS become a boon to other Linux distributions?
* Chrome OS and Android, redundant?

==== Plugin Support Added To Ubuntu Software Center ====

This Techie-Buzz article by Ricky Laishram discusses the new pluging support that has been added to the Ubuntu Software Center.

The Ubuntu Software Center for Maverick just keeps getting and better. Today a new version, Ubuntu Software Center 2.1.5, has just been released. While it does not have much visual change to offer compared to the earlier versions, it has some new features underneath.

The biggest and most interesting new feature is probably the introduction of plugins support. The plugins support in the Ubuntu Software Center is needed for the OneConf integration which will be introduced in Maverick Meerkat.

==== Improved Calculator App in Ubuntu  10.10 ====

Marious Nestor, Linux Editor for Softpedia, introduces readers to the revamped calculator application that will be part of the upcoming GNOME 3.0.0 desktop environment and Ubuntu 10.10 (Maverick Meerkat) operating system. The application is called GCalctool and it's a powerful utility that can be used to solve simple and mid-level mathematical problems. Compared to the calculator found in the Ubuntu 10.04 (Lucid Lynx) distribution, the new version of GCalctool has a redesigned user interface and brings support for complex arithmetics, complex trigonometry, additional functions (Integer and Fractional Component, Round, Floor, Ceiling and Sign) to the advanced mode, currency conversion and many more.

==== Google Nexus One Gets Ubuntu-ed ====

Bored with the same old stock version of Android on your Nexus One? Are you one of the many other Nexus One users who would like to see a different boot up screen on your phone, well help is here!

Geeky folks (one geeky folk, to be precise) from a rather ominously named blog called nexus one hacks has posted a rather longish video that can potentially help you port Ubuntu on to your highly capable handset without bricking it. Note that in this case, Ubuntu is being offered as a secondary boot option so that you may switch over to Android at the next boot should anything go wrong. Of course, as it is an OS meant for quite a different platform, you d come across a few things that simply won t work. But then that s excusable when you experience the pleasure of running an OS on a device that is not supposed to run it.

==== Early Ubuntu 10.10 Netbook Benchmarks ====

Michael Larabel, with Phoronix.com, gives a detailed look at some earler benchmarks for Ubuntu 10.10 Netbooks.

Larabel says, "There is still three months left until Ubuntu 10.10 "Maverick Meerkat" will be officially released along with the Ubuntu Netbook spin and the various other incarnations of this popular Linux distribution, but today we have some initial netbook tests of this next version of Ubuntu Linux. While Ubuntu 10.10 Netbook may boast a new user-interface now that it is using the Unity Desktop, the changes that have taken place "under the hood" have led to some performance differences compared to Ubuntu 10.04 LTS Netbook."

==== Mozilla Ramps Up Vulnerability Reward Program ====

Mozilla announces that it has brought its security bounty program in line with the new economic times and has increased the reward paid to researchers for eligible security bugs from $500 to $3,000. It has also officially added Firefox Mobile and other Mozilla services to the list of products covered by the program.

“For new bugs reported starting July 1st, 2010 UTC we are changing the bounty payment to $3,000 US per eligible security bug. A lot has changed in the 6 years since the Mozilla program was announced, and we believe that one of the best way to keep our users safe is to make it economically sustainable for security researchers to do the right thing when disclosing information,” an announcement posted on the Mozilla Security blog reads.

==== Firefox joins Microsoft in uncool kids class - Chrome hangs out, looks good ====

In this article Matt Asay, Canonical COO, he takes a look at the global browser market - who's in the lead and why it matters to Ubuntu. Asay states, "Open...and Shut After more than a decade of slugging it out with Microsoft for supremacy, Mozilla's Firefox now claims 24 per cent of the global browser market, according to Net Applications."

Asay goes on to say, "Since October 2009, Firefox has reached a curious stasis, treading water against Internet Explorer. Microsoft’s IE, for its part, continues its slide, but Firefox is no longer the aggressor. Google Chrome is."
