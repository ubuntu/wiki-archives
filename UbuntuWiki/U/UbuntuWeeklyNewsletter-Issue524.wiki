==== Bionic Beaver (18.04 LTS) Final Freeze ====

Adam Conrad of the Ubuntu release team reports that the next version of Ubuntu, the Bionic Beaver, has entered the Final Freeze period in preparation for the final release next week. With much anticipation, the current uploads in the queue will be reviewed and either accepted or rejected as appropriate by pre-freeze standards. Acceptance pertains to two broad categories: release-critical bugs, and bug fixes that would be suitable for post-release SRUs.
