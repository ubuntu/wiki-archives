==== ZFS focus on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS: what’s new? ====

Didier Roche updates us on what's new with ZFS support on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS since the support found in the prior 19.10 release.

Along with details of the improvements, some screenshots are provided, plus a link to the discourse thread if you want to join the discussion.

==== Ubuntu 20.04 Is Ridiculously Responsive, But Why? ====

Jason Evangelho writes about the progressive improvements made to performance visible to Ubuntu 19.04 & 19.10 users, but more noticeable to LTS users who recently upgraded to Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. Touching on the speed difference noticed between Unity and GNOME showing the need for these improvements, Jason details many of the events and work that gave us this performance. We are provided also with links to Daniel Van Vugt's articles on the Ubuntu discourse site.
