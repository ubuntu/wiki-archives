==== Karmic Open for Development ====

On Tuesday, April 28th, following the setting up of the toolchain, Karmic Koala began it's general development stage. Automatic syncing with Debian will begin shortly. The release schedule for Karmic is available at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KarmicReleaseSchedule. The first milestone is expected to take place mid-May, and cessation of automatic syncs with Debian around the end of August. It is suggested that developers getting involved with Karmic during the initial state of flux be prepared to recover from anything up to complete system failure.  https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel-announce/2009-April/000564.html

==== Notify OSD to be discussed at Ubuntu UDS Karmic ====

* Ubuntu UDS Karmic Koala: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UDSKarmic
* Dates: May 25th-May29th
* Where: Palau de Congressos de catalunya, Barcelona Spain

At UDS Karmic later this month, there will be a session for discussing improvements to the Notify OSD notification server. https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/dx-karmic-notify-osd

Topics for discussion will include:
* experimenting with better positioning for the notification bubbles
* improving the appearance and behavior (making composited bubbles more obviously unclickable, and non-composited bubbles classier)
* implementing the duration rules, so that notifications with longer text are shown for longer
* better handling of long backlogs of notifications
* investigating whether we can use non-critical priorities for anything useful
* helping to get the Free``Desktop.org notifications specification to 1.0
* a Qt implementation
* investigating a "do-not-disturb" mode
* accessibility, e.g. sound theme compliance and maybe alt text for icons
* media key confirmation bubbles (Play, Pause, Previous, Next)
* suppressing bubbles when any window is full-screen
* a test suite for the rendering layer.

If you want to take part in the discussion, keep an eye on the schedule here: http://summit.ubuntu.com/uds-karmic/ to find out when the session will be. If you can't attend(either physically or virtually) but have suggestions you'd like considered, please add them to the Notify OSD comments page. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NotifyOSD/Comments

==== Ubuntu Open Week Summary ====

Ubuntu Open Week finished up last Friday, and as usual, it was a great 5 days of sessions geared toward helping the community get involved. Open Week kicks off the start of each new Ubuntu release in development. With Jaunty Jackalope released, and the announcement of Karmic Koala in development, it was the perfect time to get the community together. Ubuntu Open Week gives the community an introduction to many of the Ubuntu Teams that help make Ubuntu and the Ubuntu Community what they are.

One of the most looked forward to, and highly attended sessions was of course, the Q&A session with the leader of Ubuntu, Mark Shuttleworth(sabdfl), but the list of prominent Ubuntu community members hosting sessions was, as always, impressive. You can find the logs of all the Ubuntu Open Week Sessions here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuOpenWeek just scroll down the page to "The Timetable" header and click on any session title to read the logs.

=== LoCo News ===

==== Jaunty Launch Party: Waterloo ====

The Jaunty Launch Party, held in Waterloo, New York, was planned by Jeremy (ausimage) and Landen (slick666) as both a release party and a public information session.  There were roughly 30 people in attendance with about 65% of the audience already using Linux. The event was the first multi-region, multi-LUG event planned and executed by the New York State Ubuntu local team.  Among other things, a presentation, focused on potential new users, was given.  "The Ubuntu Experience" covered the meaning of Ubuntu and why that focus makes the ubuntu community a good choice for end users.  There was also a lengthy question and answer session, food, drink, and entertainment.  More, including pictures can be seen at the link.

==== Ubuntu Berlin Jaunty Release Party ====

The Ubuntu Berlin Jaunty Release Party was once again held in c-base (their conference center).  Once again, there were advertisements for the party on Berlin's metro TV system, which resulted in a lot of new people who had never heard of Ubuntu and were curious. More than 200 people showed up for barbecue and CDs, talks (that were streamed live on the internet), and a general good time. See pictures of the event at the link.

=== Launchpad News ===

==== Launchpad 2.2.4 ====

Launchpad 2.2.4 introduces several new features such as the ability to import translations from bazaar branches and more AJAX in the web interface.

https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/launchpad-announce/2009-April/000036.html

===== Import translations from Bazaar branches =====

In the last release, the ability to import translation templates from Bazaar branches was added. Now, you can now import the actual translations.

The most common scenario that this feature will likely be used for is the initial import of translations when you start using Launchpad Translations for a project that already has translations. To make this easy to accomplish, a "Request Bazaar import” option has been added in the menu bar of your project's release series right next to "Settings". You need to have an official branch linked to this release series in order to see this button. You can go to the "Settings" page and choose "Import templates and translation files" to have Launchpad continuously import both translation templates and actual translations from your branch. The approval of translation files after they are uploaded works just as if they were uploaded through the upload form.

http://blog.launchpad.net/translations/import-translations-from-bazaar-branches

===== Introducing AJAX in the Launchpad web interface =====

Launchpad has started moving towards a Java``Script-driven interface to streamline how Launchpad is used. Green links are being added to various pages in order to make it clear to users that they can click on the link without navigating away from the page that they are currently working on. Launchpad 2.2.4 also includes a new milestone picker as well as a redesigned way to set the privacy of a bug, both of which use AJAX.

===== Two years since 1.0 =====

Here are some of the ways Launchpad has grown since releasing the beta of Launchpad 1.0 two years ago.

* People registered: 898,261 April 2007, 2,728,657 today
* Projects registered: 2,323 April 2007, 11,475 projects today
* Bug reports: 125,310 April 2007, 367,178 today
* Code branches: 2,459 April 2007, 29,380 today

Launchpad has also introduced Personal Package Archives, a web
services API, mailing list hosting, code review, plugins for two-way
communication between Launchpad and external trackers, and many other features.

==== Launchpad’s web service code released as stand alone libraries ====

After several weeks of work and sprint in Montreal, you can now create your own web service using the same techniques used in Launchpad.

The library is lazr.restful, and there's a companion client library called lazr.restfulclient. They're also on Py``Pl(restful, restfulclient). The place to discuss these libraries is on the lazr-users-mailing list.

The goal is to remove almost all code from launchpadlib, leaving only the OAuth handling and some launchpad-specific information. They are also working on making it easier to use lazr.restful with standard WSGI applications, so you do not have to know as much Zope.

http://blog.launchpad.net/general/launchpads-web-service-code-released-as-standalone-libraries

=== Ubuntu Forums News ===

==== New prefixes in the help sub-forums ====

Two new prefixes were added this week, wubi and unr (Ubuntu Network Remix). They are available to threads in the support area. Following our previous rationale not to increase the number of categories, it is now preferred to use either prefixes (adding new ones is only available to admins) or tags (any member can add a tag to any thread).

==== Hiding post (beans) count ====

Hiding post counts is available again from userCP. Number of posts in the support area can still be seen when visiting the user profile. Beans only add up when posting in help areas, not in the general community chat areas. When users reach 3,500 beans, they can customize their title.

==== RoAkSoAx: Announcing the Ubuntu High Availability Team ====

In the latest Server Team meeting, Ro``Ak``So``Ax presented the idea that HA Cluster packages should be important for the Server Team and that the team should also concentrate on this packets and be a bug contact for them. Why, because companies nowadays work with clusters or want to start using them, which makes Ubuntu a possible choose. He had had this idea for a long time, but never presented it to the Server Team. In the meeting it was decided to create the Ubuntu High Availability Team. This team will work with packages related to HA Clustering in Ubuntu, as a bug contact for them. A mailing list has been created. So, if you like HA clustering, and you want to collaborate triaging bugs related to this packages, everyone is welcome to join!

==== doctormo: Ubuntu Brains ====

Ubuntu Community Learning Project(Ubuntu Brains): https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Learning

This project is to create an interactive learning environment based on Moodle to support new users becoming more engaged in the Ubuntu community. The goal is to take new motivated users and turn them into contributing members of the community. The intend is to do this by working with existing teams such as the classroom team, as well as trying to leverage the work and ongoing training already being done by the MOTU Team, Bug Squad, Doc Team, Desktop Training, and Lo``Co's to develop an integrated training solution, In turn, that will allow the community to undertake self paced and instructor lead training in conjunction with IRC based training and question times. This is similar to what most teams already are doing individually but gives more flexibility in providing quality training materials that will assist in learning without requiring as much IRC time.

http://doctormo.wordpress.com/2009/04/30/ubuntu-brains/

==== Matt Zimmerman: Ubuntu 9.04 does not use ext4 by default ====

There seems to be a significant misconception around Ubuntu 9.04, that it uses the (comparatively new) ext4 filesystem by default. It doesn’t. Ubuntu 9.04 still uses the tried-and-true ext3 filesystem by default. If you install Ubuntu 9.04 and use automatic partitioning, you will get ext3, which we consider to be the most stable option at this time. ext4 is available as an option in the manual partitioning screen for people who wish to try out the latest stuff. There are some known bugs which affect this configuration, though, and filesystem bugs generally carry the risk of lost data, so this is not for the faint of heart.

http://mdzlog.alcor.net/2009/05/01/ubuntu-904-does-not-use-ext4-by-default/

=== In The Press ===

==== Ubuntu 9.04 ====

Kevin Anderson of The Guardian reports that Canonical has unleashed the Jackalope, or Ubuntu 9.04, code-named the Jaunty Jackalope. It's the latest release of an operating system that has become one of the most popular Linux distributions, and it manages to balance adding new features (including cloud computing), a netbook release and an improved interface with performance. That's a balance that Microsoft and Apple don't always make with major updates to their operating systems. Anderson has been using Ubuntu since 6.10, and he feels that with each release that Ubuntu has become a little more polished. To him everything just feels smoother and more responsive in Ubuntu 9.04. http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/apr/30/canonical-ubuntu

==== An open letter to Mark Shuttleworth ====

Tux Radar says to Mark Shuttleworth, "Thanks for creating Ubuntu! Jaunty is the best release yet - stable, fast and full of features, just the way we like it." Not everything is the way they like though, "There's one thing we don't like, and that thing is Update Manager's new-found pop-under behaviour. We understand the need to encourage people to install security updates, but getting on their nerves just doesn't seem like the smart solution." They propose an idea to use the new notification system to point out what critical updates are available, but point out that the the Updates Available balloon may not be the best option. They do feel that it's a better better option than the pop under window though. Tux Radar finishes with, "Let's work together to make the Linux desktop smarter, smoother, and as irritation-free as possible." http://www.tuxradar.com/content/open-letter-mark-shuttleworth

==== Has Ubuntu Reached the End Of the Line? ====

IT World's Keir Thomas says, "I admit it. I'm impressed. I might have written a wishy-washy review of the beta of Ubuntu 9.04, but now I've had a chance to play with the final release, I like what I'm seeing. I like it a lot. Well done, Ubuntu guys!" There can be no doubt that the Ubuntu guys have finally caught up with Windows and Mac OS X, but Thomas would argue that Ubuntu actually crossed the finish line this time last year, when 8.04 was released. Ubuntu 8.04 was a genuine swap-in replacement for Windows or Mac OS X. It really was Linux for the ordinary human. No hype. No bullhonkey. All of this leaves the Ubuntu guys with a very real problem: Where do they go next? http://www.linuxworld.com/news/2009/042709-has-ubuntu-reached-the-end.html?fsrc=rss-linux-news

==== Which Vendors were mentioned with Ubuntu Linux last week? ====

With Microsoft posting its first quarterly loss last week, lots of people are looking for reasons. One of the reasons that some people point to is the rise of Linux. This past week was a big one for many in the Linux community with a major release of Ubuntu Linux. The interesting thing about Ubuntu is that it is trying to be a mainstream operating system as opposed to just appealing to the core Linux community itself, but how does the media see Ubuntu? Running a search for Ubuntu, it is possible to determine which other vendors were mentioned in stories alongside it. Stats show that Microsoft is the most mentioned vendor (and perhaps competitor?) to Ubuntu Linux. Further review reveals an interesting data set that provides some insight into how the media perceives and writes about Ubuntu. http://www.itdatabase.com/blog/archives/262

==== Ubuntu Jaunty Tries to Set the Usability Agenda ====

Bruce Byfield notes that with the first release in 2004, Ubuntu established itself as one of the most user-friendly GNU/Linux distributions available. Since then, each release has reaffirmed this reputation. However, with the supposedly improved notifications system in the recently-released Jaunty Jackalope, Ubuntu unintentionally raises a new issue in usability, which is whether a distribution can or should set the usability agenda by itself. The fact that Ubuntu should be the distribution where this issue arises seems inevitable. Some other distributions like Fedora and Mandriva also have an interest in usability, but few have such a long and extensive history of desktop improvements, nor such an apparent hurry to improve the user experience as Ubuntu. http://itmanagement.earthweb.com/osrc/article.php/3817576/Ubuntu-Debates-Usability-Changes-Passionately.htm

==== Ubuntu: keyword is more popular than Windows XP in Google Trend ====

Tech``Worlds.net reports that Ubuntu has finally eclipsed Windows XP in terms of popularity according to the most recent data from Google Trends. It could be argued that Windows XP is too old that’s why it’s losing its appeal and is going downhill. Compare Ubuntu with the fresh Windows Vista or with the upcoming Windows 7 shows Ubuntu still out pacing its Microsoft competitors. These statistics from Google Trends are another solid proof that Ubuntu is key to Linux mainstream adoption. http://www.techworlds.net/technology/ubuntu-keyword-is-more-popular-than-windows-xp-in-google-trend/

=== In The Blogosphere ===

==== Cloud computing with Ubuntu Server Edition 9.x ====

Blogger Voyager8 gives us a look at some of the new features in cloud computing introduced in Ubuntu Server Edition 9.04 Jaunty Jackalope. First he points out the 2 types of clouds that are offered: Ubuntu on Amazon EC2, and the Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud. Voyager8 says, "Cloud computing transforms traditional server infrastructure into a dynamic environment that expands and reduces capacity depending on requirements." Voyager8 then speaks of the flexibility and efficiency, and greater utilization that cloud computing can provide. He then points out the Canonical announcement that the next version of Ubuntu 9.10 Karmic Koala is planned to be very cloud oriented. http://voyager8.blogspot.com/2009/04/cloud-computing-with-ubuntu-server.html

==== Jaunty Jackalope: Are Alarm Bells Ringing in Redmond? ====

Ubuntu's Jaunty Jackalope has bounded onto desktops, and reaction in the Linux blogosphere is mostly thumbs up. With the release of Ubuntu 9.04 last week, it's not too surprising that few other topics got much attention on the Linux blogs in the ensuing days. When it came right down to it, though, it seemed people mostly just wanted to talk about Ubuntu 9.04 -- Jaunty Jackalope, that is, the successor to Intrepid Ibex. It soon became clear that the release was a very, very exciting one, if the discussions were anything to go by. Titles such as: Not bad at all, All Ubuntu all the time, Gigantic Improvements, I want to upgrade so badly, and I prefer Debian were just a few. Read several of the articles or get the link to them at the site. http://www.linuxinsider.com/story/66905.html?wlc=1241367307

==== System76 Launches Ubuntu 9.04 Netbook ====

Joe Panettieri, of Works``With``U, looks at the new offering from System76 - the Starling Net``Book that's loaded with Ubuntu 9.04 Netbook Remix. Without actually having his hands on one yet, he goes over the specifications and pricing for this new device. He's had good experience with a System76 laptop, and is impressed by the increase in their revenues due to the match-up with Ubuntu. His only concern is whether netbooks will continue to do as well in the marketplace, and whether both System76 and Ubuntu can maintain quality in the face of trying to build even lower-cost systems.
http://www.workswithu.com/2009/04/27/system76-launches-ubuntu-904-netbook/

==== Ubuntu 9.04: Wow ====

Jack Wallen, reporting for Tech``Republic, hasn't been terrifically impressed with Ubuntu since about 7.04.  It seamed to him that the distribution was getting progressively more sluggish.  Couple that with an ageing laptop with quirky graphics, and he didn't hold much hope for Ubuntu 9.04.  But he was in for a pleasant surprise.  It not only installed and loaded, but ran faster than anything he'd had on it recently.  It's his opinion that all the claims that Mark Shuttleworth made for the release were true, and all he could say was "WOW".

==== 10 reasons you'll want to install Ubuntu 9.04 ====

Ubuntu has brought Linux to the masses better than any other Linux distribution. And with its recent 9.04 release, Ubuntu has not only continued to create one of the most user-friendly operating systems available, it has made it faster and more reliable. Let’s take a look to see if there is one (or 10) reasons to entice you to install Ubuntu 9.04. The following are in no certain order: Ext4, GNOME 2.26.1, Speed, Cleanup Janitor, Nautilus Encryption, Xorg 1.6, Notifications and system messages, Native ARM support, Better menu layout, and Better wireless support. Those are 10 solid reasons to give Ubuntu 9.04 a try. Is it perfect? No, but what operating system is? I can happily say, however, that 9.04 might be the strongest overall release of a Linux distribution I have seen to date. http://blogs.techrepublic.com.com/10things/?p=707

==== Canonical Engaging Ubuntu Software Partners ====

Joe Panettieri of Works``With``U discusses what he's seen of the relationship between Canonical and Independent Software Vendors (ISVs). Overall, he feels that response from ISVs for Ubuntu 9.04 was somewhat lacking. However, he also sees that Canonical and its partners are working to coordinate their efforts through various means, including conferences and working closely with Canonical. He feels that what Canonical and Ubuntu need right now is ISVs that are passionate about working together.
