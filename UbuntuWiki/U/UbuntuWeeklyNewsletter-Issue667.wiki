=== The Planet ===

==== Upgrading Ubuntu ====

Alan Pope tells us he tends to run Ubuntu as his primary OS on all his computers, and did so before he was employed by Canonical too, as Alan prefers Ubuntu. In his notes of dalliance with other operating systems and desktops, Alan talks about his "dally" with KDE Neon and issues downloading it at an airport, then installing it on a flight. Alan then gives us his perspectives on upgrade preferences and why his is to use the upgrade tools do-release-upgrade and update-manager. He outlines some of the perils in the upgrade process and why to proceed.
