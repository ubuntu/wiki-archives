== What is Ubuntu Kylin? ==

The objective of the Ubuntu Kylin project is to create a variant of Ubuntu that is more suitable for Chinese users. We are committed to provide you with a delicate, thoughtful and fully customized Chinese user experience out-of-the-box. For instance, by providing a desktop user interface localized in Chinese and installing common software that Chinese users commonly use by default. Ubuntu Kylin has been a formal member of the Ubuntu family, since UbuntuKylin 13.04. Now, we are working on 14.04.

== Features in Ubuntu Kylin 14.04 Beta 2 Release ==

We are glad to announce the Release of Ubuntu Kylin 14.04 Beta 2. In this beta release, the Linux Kernel is updated to 3.13. This Beta 2 fixes more than 100 bugs in total and ships more features. Some other features are in final QA process and will be integrated soon.

'''Note That: '''This is a beta pre-release, which is not suitable for normal users, but for Ubuntu Kylin developers and users who want to help us test by finding, reporting, and/or fixing bugs.

=== System Requirements ===

A Pentium II or Celeron system with 512 MB of RAM is probably a bottom-line configuration that may yield slow yet usable system with a standard Ubuntu Kylin desktop.

14.04 ISO require your CPU to have Physical Address Extensions, or PAE. "PAE is provided by Intel Pentium Pro and above CPUs, including all later Pentium-series processors (except most 400 MHz-bus versions of the Pentium M)." - If you have a NON-PAE CPU and would like to install Ubuntu 12.10, please see <nowiki>[[http://www.webupd8.org/2012/11/how-to-install-ubuntu-1210-on-non-pae.html | this link]]</nowiki> or you can use Ubuntu 12.04 instead.
For Intel based Macs, Ubuntu Kylin 14.04 should run on all models.
