Replace the gnome-screensaver as the lock screen with the use of lightdm as the lock screen and modify Unity7 to respond to Lock/Unlock events.

=== Tasks ===

* have Unity react to to Lock/Unlock signals from logind/consolekit
* have Unity forward lock/unlock requests to LightDM to ensure proper locking in all use cases (LightDM will coalesce calls)
* investigate and remedy the existing gnome-session-daemon interaction with gnome-screensaver so there is no conflict
