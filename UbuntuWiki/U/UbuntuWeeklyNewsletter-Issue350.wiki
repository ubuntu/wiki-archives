=== Canonical News ===

==== New year, new website: the new canonical.com ====
Canonical celebrates its 10th anniversary this year, and with this milestone, the team felt it was a good time to give the website a facelift. The new site aims to distill all that Canonical is and does into its most essential elements in order to be easier to navigate and understand.

http://design.canonical.com/2014/01/new-year-new-website-the-new-canonical-com/

==== Ubuntu scores highest in UK Gov security assessment ====

Canonical has announced that the UK government’s security arm CESG has published a report which assesses the security of all ‘End User Device’ operating systems.

=== In The Press ===

Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols of ZDNet gives us a wide overview of what to expect from Canonical and Ubuntu in the coming year. Highlights include Ubuntu Touch smartphones, and a single code-base for desktops, tablets and phones on which to develop new applications.

http://www.zdnet.com/what-to-expect-from-ubuntu-in-2014-7000024789/

==== Firefox OS, Ubuntu Touch enter the mobile operating system fray ====

Gadjo Cardenas Sevilla of the Calgary Herald writes that with the arrival of Firefox OS and Ubuntu Touch, the smartphone market is rapidly heating up. Though neither are likely to make a big dent in the market this year, their very presence will push all the major players to innovate more rapidly, while giving users a wider variety of phones and systems to choose from.

http://www.calgaryherald.com/technology/Firefox+Ubuntu+Touch+enter+mobile+operating+system+fray/9360311/story.html

=== In The Blogosphere ===

==== Ubuntu 14.04's lock screen updated with clock support ====

razvi of iloveubuntu acquaints us with Ubuntu 14.04’s lock screen, which has recently been updated to include a clock. While a seemingly minor addition, it significantly improves the lock screen experience.

http://iloveubuntu.net/ubuntu-1404s-lock-screen-updated-clock-support

==== Ubuntu Will Add Torrent Search to Embed Free Culture Into User Experience ====

Thanks to a new scope, users of The Pirate Bay will be able to search for torrents directly from the Unity desktop. The scope was endorsed by Mark Shuttleworth in late December, when he wrote “The tool is super-useful and it’s perfectly justified to make it available by default. We use torrents for distributing Ubuntu itself. So please don’t hold back!"

http://torrentfreak.com/ubuntu-to-add-torrent-search-140104/

==== Multiple Ubuntu Phones To Launch in 2014 ====

Joey-Elijah Sneddon of OMG! Ubuntu! reports on the coming year which will see the launch of multiple Ubuntu Touch phones according to Ubuntu’s Community Manager Jono Bacon. His comments follow others made by Mark Shuttleworth regarding a ‘high end’ smartphone made by a well-known brand set to debut in 2014, though exactly which ‘well-known’ brand that is remains open to speculation.

http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2014/01/several-ubuntu-phones-release-2014

==== Ubuntu 13.10: 5 things we love, 5 things we hate ====

Tom Henderson of Network``World has released a short review of Ubuntu 13.10, including 5 things to love about Canonical’s most recent Ubuntu release.

http://www.networkworld.com/slideshow/134353/ubuntu-1310-5-things-we-love-5-things-we-hate.html

==== Ubuntu 14.04 received minor-yet-relevant visual improvement ====

razvi of iloveubuntu writes that the upcoming release of Ubuntu 14.04 ‘Trusty Tahr’ includes several minor and yet important visual improvements, including a new look for Gedit.

http://iloveubuntu.net/ubuntu-1404-received-minor-yet-relevant-visual-improvement

==== MATE Desktop Environment Will Be Available in Ubuntu 14.04 ====

Joey-Elijah Sneddon of OMG! Ubuntu! tells us that Ubuntu 14.04 will include the MATE Desktop environment for the first time. MATE 1.6 is a fork of GNOME 2.x which preserves the 2-panel layout familiar to Ubuntu users prior to Unity’s release. Other similar environments can be found in Cinnamon and GNOME 3’s Classic Mode.

http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2014/01/mate-desktop-ubuntu-1404

==== Ubuntu Has ‘No Plans’ To Make a Smartwatch ====

Joey-Elijah Sneddon of OMG! Ubuntu! writes that Canonical has no plans to join the current trend for wearable technology. Joey-Elijah summarizes his post by saying "Having fingers poked in multiple pies may feel exciting but, with their hands fully free, Canonical are better placed to shaped each of the target form-factors in turn, an approach that will, ultimately, deliver a more polished result. "
