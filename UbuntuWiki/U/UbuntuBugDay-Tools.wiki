Ubuntu HugDay-Tools are a set utilities to simplify the managing of the UbuntuBugDay, it so far allows you to:
* get a list of ubuntu hugdays
* get a list of tasks for a hugday
* mark tasks as DONE

=== Download it ===

You can download some older packaged versions of the tools from <nowiki>[[https://edge.launchpad.net/~thekorn/+archive/ppa|Markus Korn PPA]]</nowiki> or get the branch with:
<pre>
    $ bzr branch lp:hugday-tools
</pre>

You may also need to install python-libxml2 before using the tools.
<pre>
    $ sudo apt-get install python-libxml2
</pre>

=== HowTo use it ===

* get url of latest hugday:
<pre>
    $ hugday current
</pre>
* If you would like to run any of the following commands it is essential to run
<pre>
    $ hugday current --remember
</pre>
By running this command know on which hugday you operate

* get list of all task for current hugday:
<pre>
    $ hugday list
    $ hugday list --filter open  (get list of all open tasks)
</pre>

So far the hugday tool did not change any content of a wiki page, to
be able to do so, the tool needs the users MOIN ID, so first you need to log in to the 
<nowiki>[[http://wiki.ubuntu.com|Ubuntu Wiki]]</nowiki> and then run:
<pre>
    $ hugday init --user LAUNCHPAD_ID --cookie PATH/TO/MOZILLA/COOKIE
</pre>

Where LAUNCHPAD_ID is the name which will be shown in the 'triager' column
after marking a task as DONE. Please only use your Launchpad Id so you can be listed at the 5-a-day automatically as well and COOKIE is the cookies.sqlite or
cookie.txt of your mozilla browser profile. 

'''NOTE''': you need to close your browser while running the command above as the cookie.sqlite can only be accessed by one process at the same time. 

If you are not using a mozilla based browser you can also search for the MOIN_ID or
MOIN_SESSION in the cookie file of your browser and run
<pre>   
    $ hugday init --user LAUNCHPAD_ID --wiki-id (MOIN_ID or MOIN_SESSION)
</pre>
Now marking tasks as DONE by you is as simple as running:
<pre>
    $ hugday close 123456 23456 3456 456
</pre>
