==== UDS registration opened on March 12th ====

The UDS registration form is now open. UDS is an open event, which brings together Canonical engineers, community members, partners, upstream representatives, and cloud specialists, in an environment of active collaboration and debate.

You can learn more at http://uds.ubuntu.com

==== Ubuntu 12.04 Development update ====

The Ubuntu Development News team shares some stats (as of publishing on Thursday, March 15): “42 days until Ubuntu 12.04, the sixteenth Ubuntu release and fourth LTS will be released. This makes six weeks in which the following things are going to happen: one week until Beta 2 Freeze and docs will be frozen, two weeks until Beta 2 gets out, three weeks until the kernel is frozen, four weeks until we hit Final Freeze and it will be hard to squeeze fixes in.”

Among other things, links to blog posts from developers throughout the community are presented, a list of upcoming events, a spotlight on “Putting the Ubuntu Development process to the test” and ways to get involved with development are included in this update.

=== Ubuntu Cloud News ===

==== Ubuntu Cloud Guest images in Amazon’s quickstart launcher ====

Jorge Castro shares that, since many people provide Ubuntu AMIs on AWS, the Ubuntu Cloud team has now branded the official Ubuntu images as “Ubuntu Cloud Guest”. Other images that are based on Ubuntu are simply branded as “Ubuntu”.  Official images are also using the Orange Circle of Friends, the rest are using the Black Circle of Friends. They hope this makes it easier for people to differentiate between official AMIs and AMIs provided by others.

=== The Planet ===

==== Didier Roche: New, shiny, Unity 5.6 released! ====

Didier Roche announces that a new version of Unity, 5.6, landed in Precise this week. He notes that there are “tons of bug fixes and miscellaneous improvements,” including “a patch in compiz that enhances its performance for more than 51%.”

http://blog.didrocks.fr/post/New%2C-shiny%2C-Unity-5.6-released%21

==== Ubuntu Classroom: IRC Operator Class: IRC Basics & Working with Network Services, Aliases and More! ====

The first of a series of “fun and interesting classes on being in IRC Operator” was held recently by Miia Ranta focusing on IRC basics for Ubuntu IRC Operators.  Link to the logs of this first session included.

==== Jono Bacon: Ubuntu Accomplishments Updates ====

Jono Bacon updates the community about the current status of Ubuntu Accomplishments. He gives a video demo of the working system, and writes about the work going into making it as easy as possible to contribute documentation to the project.

http://www.jonobacon.org/2012/03/14/ubuntu-accomplishments-updates-2/

==== Mark Shuttleworth: Ubuntu vs RHEL in enterprise computing ====

Mark Shuttleworth noted that the trend for large-scale enterprise web server workloads indicates that Ubuntu is now being adopted over RHEL. In addition there is a wider community response to the goal of cadence, with the example of OpenStack's Essex. Shuttleworth wrote, "OpenStack’s Essex release is lined up to be a perfect fit for 12.04 LTS. That is not a coincidence, it’s a value to which both projects are committed. Upstream projects that care about their users and care about being adopted quickly, want an effective conduit of their goodness straight to users."

==== Daniel Holbach: Putting the Ubuntu Development process to the test ====

Daniel Holbach presents a new initiative to gain testers, which will help to improve the Ubuntu development process. 

http://daniel.holba.ch/blog/2012/03/putting-the-ubuntu-development-process-to-the-test/

==== Jonathan Riddell: Kubuntu Active is Activated ====

Jonathan Riddell announces daily builds of the new Ubuntu flavor for Tablets: Kubuntu Active. “Images are for i386 only for now, ARMv7 should be added when we know it's a bit more stable and have testers.”

http://blogs.kde.org/node/4544

==== Daniel Holbach: Making sure code gets reviewed in Ubuntu ====

Daniel Holbach describes the sponsorship queue process that new contributors go through to contribute newly packaged software to the Ubuntu repository. He presents a graph showing the status of the queue and notes that new requests come in and the queue is reviewed on a regular basis, with approximately 50 requests in the queue at any given time. This number is still higher than they’d like, so he asks the community “If you can review code, please help out.”

==== Ubuntu App Developer Blog: Top 10 Ubuntu app downloads for February 2012 ====

The top 10 Ubuntu app downloads from February have been announced. Real-time naval strategy game “Oil Rush” tops the list, with familiar favorites like Braid, World of Goo, Core Breach, and Trauma also in the running. Aside from games, both Fluendo DVD Playback and Fluendo Complete Playback Pack are among the top downloads for the month.

Canonical shows off a revamped way of managing open windows and tasks, called "The Spread." It features a slicker design, better app integration, filter options, and is designed to work between workspaces and multiple monitors. 

http://design.canonical.com/2012/03/task-switching-in-ubuntu-and-a-introduction-to-the-spread/

==== Mythbuntu: Mythbuntu changing to LTS only releases ====

The Mythbuntu team announces that “starting with the 12.04 release we will be moving to LTS only releases. Mythbuntu ISOs will only be released for LTS releases. MythTV packages will still be provided in the Ubuntu and Mythbuntu repositories for every Ubuntu release (both LTS and non-LTS).” The post goes on to detail what this means for users, rationale for the change, and how to get involved.

=== In The Press ===

==== Has Canonical Found the Keys to the Computing Kingdom? ====

Katherine Noyes of Linux Insider speculates about the future of Ubuntu and Canonical. After major announcements like Ubuntu TV and Ubuntu for Android, the question of whether Ubuntu is "the next Apple" is raised. In contrast, several critics voice their opinion that the Ubuntu project may be making mistakes by moving too quickly.

http://www.linuxinsider.com/story/74613.html

==== Shuttleworth: Ubuntu rockets up at enterprises ====

Timothy Prickett Morgan of The Register reports on some of the comments from Mark Shuttleworth’s recent blog post regarding the growth in Ubuntu and Debian over RPM-based alternatives. Morgan explores how W3Techs, the source of the statistics Shuttleworth bases his post around, are collected and discusses how the trend of Open Stack with Ubuntu may change the landscape.

==== Is Ubuntu becoming a big name in enterprise Linux servers? ====

Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols of zdnet writes about how Ubuntu is the top operating system in the Amazon EC2 cloud. Vaughan-Nichols writes, "In my own research, I found that Cloud Market, a group that scans the Amazon EC2 cloud use, shows Ubuntu is the top operating system with almost 12-thousand instances. Generic Linux comes in second trailing by thousands, and Windows is far behind in third with 3.58-thousand instances. Combining RHEL with its clone, CentOS, the Red Hat family came in with about 2.3-thousand."

==== Ubuntu For Android Can Disrupt The Enterprise Market ====

==== Canonical To Organize Ubuntu Cloud Day In India ====

Swampnil Bhartiya of Muktware reports on the recently announced Ubuntu Cloud Day presented by Canonical in Bangalore, India. “The event aims to introduce developers and engineers to the Ubuntu Cloud, which is fast gaining popularity across the world. With keynote speeches from various members of the Canonical Cloud team, as well as hands-on technical sessions, the day is designed to deliver an enriching experience for any developer to rapidly be brought up-to-speed on Ubuntu Cloud and the latest developments in the same.”
