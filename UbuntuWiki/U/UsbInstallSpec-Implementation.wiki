__TOC__

So far, I've made a basic backend. There's no point it me writing a shell script, seeing as it'll have to be rewritten anyway, so heres a vague outline:

* Ask the user if (s)he wants ubuntu, kubuntu or xubuntu and i386 or AMD64
* Ask the user what version to use.
* Ask which pen drive to use, and make sure it is at least 720MB. 
* Warn the user that the pen drive will be erased.
* Download <nowiki>[[http://alecjw.no-ip.org/usbuntu/mbr.bz2|this]]</nowiki>, unzip it and write it to the pen drive. This contains the partition table (a single 720MB FAT16 partition) and the MBR.
* Do the command: syslinux -s <first partition of the pen drive>
* Mount the first partition on the pen drive.
* Download http://alecjw.no-ip.org/usbuntu/ubuntu-7.10-alternate-i386.tar.bz2 (kubuntu/xubuntu, other archs and other versions will be there soon, just replace the appropriate parts of the filename) unzip it to the pen drive.
* Copy the CD image to the pen drive (maybe offer to download it if the user does not have a copy?)
* You're done!
