=== Introduction ===

Patch Queue Manager (PQM) should be able to enforce policy on the commit summary message.

=== Rationale ===

The Launchpad team want this to make committers say who reviewed their code, using the convention of "r=ReviewerName,ReviewerName2", "rs=ReviewerName", "[Trivial]".

=== Scope and Use Cases ===

On a merge to certain configured branches, PQM will check the commit summary message against a regex for that branch.  On failure, a suitable message will be sent back to the email address that submitted the request to PQM.  The merge will not be attempted if the commit message does not meet with the requirements for its branch.

=== Implementation Plan ===
RobertCollins to implement this internally for Canonical, and also make this feature available in PQM upstream.
