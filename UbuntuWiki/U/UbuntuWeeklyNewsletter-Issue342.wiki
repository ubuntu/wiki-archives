==== Saucy Party in Flix, Catalonia ====

Rafael Carreras writes "Last Saturday Catalan Lo``Co Team did its Ubuntu Saucy Salamander 13.10 Party at the Enric Grau Fontseré School in Flix, Catalonia with some 40 people who attended to the different speeches and installs." Rafael also shows us some photographs of the event.

==== Benjamin Kerensa: Ubuntu User Advocacy ====

Benjamin Kerensa makes a proposal to start a discussion on having a User Advisory Team in Ubuntu to make User Advocacy a priority on the desktop. Benjamin continues to explain the purpose of User Advocacy and states that feedback from users on their desktop experience and feedback on features should be measured and analyzed. There is a poll on the site asking, “Should User Advocacy be made a priority?”

http://benjaminkerensa.com/2013/11/04/ubuntu-user-advocacy

==== Jani Monoses: My first Ubuntu phone app ====

Jani Monoses describes his experience of writing a simple memory game for small children, a clone of the GCompris railway activity which is about watching cartoon trains composed of a locomotive and a small number of wagons scroll on the screen and then trying to reconstruct them from memory. Jani describes the process of building and deploying the app and adds "I made a minor bugfix release of the game yesterday (0.1.2) but I am not sure how to upgrade to it on the device. Still lots of things to learn about and fix on Ubuntu for phones :)"

http://janimo.blogspot.com/2013/11/my-first-ubuntu-phone-app.html

==== Canonical Design Team: Planning a cathedral at the bazaar ====

Peter Mahnke of the Canonical Design Team says “So I am stretching the metaphor a bit, but I think it [Planning a cathedral at the bazaar] accurately explains my experience of the recent cloud sprint in San Francisco and informs us that some people are coordinating releases, some are planning the next six month cycle and some are trying to design for the next year or more. Peter finishes by saying "We shake hands with friends and colleagues that we will only talk to online for a few months and head home to get building."

http://design.canonical.com/2013/11/planning-a-cathedral-at-the-bazaar/

==== Adnane Belmadiaf: Ubuntu Touch User-Agent ====

Adnane Belmadiaf writes that Ubuntu Touch v1.0 now ships its own Qt``Web``Kit-based browser which will be replaced by Oxide, a Chromium-powered webview, by the release of 14.04 and that there has been a lot of discussions around the user-agent. Adnane illustrates how the browser will identify depending on whether a phone or tablet is being used and concludes "So if you are doing UA sniffing it's really better to look for "Mobile" rather than looking the OS identifier."

http://daker.me/2013/11/ubuntu-touch-user-agent.html

==== Ubuntu App Developer Blog: New API docs added ====

Michael Hall writes when Ubuntu 13.10 was released a new API documentation website on the Ubuntu Developer Portal went live and that it will slowly replace the previous static docs which came in a variety of formats. Michael shows us a screenshot of the site and tell us about the content found there.

http://developer.ubuntu.com/2013/11/new-api-docs-added/

==== Benjamin Kerensa: Ubuntu Foundation ====

Benjamin Kerensa writes "The more and more I see stellar Ubuntu contributors say Goodbye to Ubuntu the more I think there is a growing need for the Ubuntu Community to have a foundation much like Word``Press, Python and any other number of open source projects." Benjamin goes on to say why he thinks a foundation is important and adds that without such a foundation, Ubuntu will be more about making a profit or meeting the expectations of users Canonical is so desperately trying to woo...Windows and Mac users.

http://benjaminkerensa.com/2013/11/09/ubuntu-foundation

==== Charles Profitt: Canonical and the Cease and Desist Letter ====

Charles Profitt writes "Recently Canonical sent a cease and desist letter to Micah Lee and he responded by having a lawyer respond and compromised by taking down the logo and adding a disclaimer to his site." Charles says that he does not wish to take sides about who was right or who was wrong, and he provides some examples of the ‘flame posts’ in this argument that he feels are out of line and inappropriate.

http://ftbeowulf.wordpress.com/2013/11/09/canonical-and-the-cease-and-desist-letter/

==== Mark Shuttleworth: Mistakes made and addressed ====

Mark Shuttleworth writes "Occasionally we make mistakes. When we do it’s appropriate to apologise, address them, and take steps to ensure they don’t happen again." In a lengthy post Mark makes references to tea parties, trademarks, correspondence templates and the label “open source tea party” to refer to the vocal non-technical critics of work that Canonical does. Mark concludes "Please accept my apologies if you have been a vocal non-technical critic of Canonical’s software and felt offended by the label."

=== Canonical News ===

==== Ubuntu OIL announced for broadest set of cloud infrastructure options ====

Canonical have written "at the Open``Stack Design Summit in Hong Kong, we announced the Ubuntu Open``Stack Interoperability Lab (Ubuntu OIL). The programme will test and validate the interoperability of hardware and software in a purpose-built lab, giving Ubuntu Open``Stack users the reassurance and flexibility of choice." The announcement goes on to list the many significant partners on-board, such as Dell, EMC, Emulex, Fusion-io, HP, IBM, Inktank/Ceph, Intel, LSi, Open Compute, Sea``Micro, and VMware. Involvement in the lab is through the Canonical Partner Programme.

http://insights.ubuntu.com/news/ubuntu-oil-announced-for-broadest-set-of-cloud-infrastructure-options/

==== Trademarks, community and criticism ====

Steve George, Vice President of Operations for Canonical, responded to concerns about a cease and desist letter being sent to Micah Flee for the site fixubuntu.com. Steve affirms that the matter has been settled by application of a disclaimer of non-endorsement on the site and that Ubuntu embraces open and diverse discourse.

=== In The Press ===

==== Ubuntu nails colours to the CloudFoundry mast with OpenStack PaaS ====

Phil Muncaster of The Register writes that Canonical has announced two major new projects with Pivotal designed to bring Platform as a Service capabilities to all Open``Stack implementations. Phil says "with Ubuntu’s colours now nailed firmly to the Pivotal/Open Foundry mast, all the momentum in the Open``Stack space would certainly seem to be with this platform, rather than Solum."

http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/11/05/ubuntu_canonical_pivotal_cloudfoundry/

==== Ubuntu's Saucy Salamander is a Slick but Spiritless Upgrade ====

Jack M. Germain of Linux``Insider writes that Ubuntu 13.10 does not deliver much "wow" and serves mostly as a tune-up version before the release of the next LTS. Jack takes a look at the desktop appearance, the installation, Smart Scopes, included software, and he concludes "if you want a solid distro and can work with Unity or GNOME 3 variations, Saucy Salamander might just be worth your while until its replacement arrives."

=== In The Blogosphere ===

==== Meet "A Raspberry Pi Build Cluster for Ubuntu", Indiegogo campaign aimed at "bootable SD card image" ====

razvi of iloveubuntu informs us of an interesting project, "A Raspberry Pi Build Cluster for Ubuntu" and the Indiegogo campaign managed by third-party developer Alan Bell. razvi says the project is aimed at attracting funds for purchasing and building a cluster of Raspberry Pi machines, in order to compile all the source code for Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, 13.10, and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. Alan tells us more in the short embedded video.

==== Linux OS on the rise: Steam Hardware Survey ====

Muktware reports that according to the Steam Hardware Survey from Valve, there has been a considerable increase in number of Linux-compatible games on Steam for Linux. A breakdown of operating systems shows that Ubuntu 13.04 64-bit is in the lead; a link is provided to the complete survey.

==== Ubuntu Touch Toolbars Made More Discoverable ====

Joey-Elijah Sneddon of OMG! Ubuntu! tells us that finding and accessing application toolbars on Ubuntu Touch has been made easier in recent builds as toolbars are now shown by default for a short period when opening an app or changing view. Joey-Elijah explains that Ubuntu Touch prefers to give more screen space to content than other OSes, and describes how the change makes navigating 'back' through an app much quicker.

http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2013/11/ubuntu-touch-toolbar-design-change

==== Linux Desktop In The Enterprise: Ubuntu Vs. Windows ====

Joseph Granneman of Network Computing writes "Now, with shrinking technology budgets and rising Microsoft licensing fees, it's time for IT to seriously consider desktop Linux deployment as an alternative to Windows." Joseph makes reference to Windows XP having just five months of support remaining and its users having to change to something new. He says legacy Windows applications can be accessed through Citrix or RDP clients. He concludes that Ubuntu Linux has matured into a viable alternative to proprietary operating systems, adding that next year may finally be the “year of the Linux desktop.”

==== Ubuntu Touch Browser Finally Given Unique User Agent String ====

Joey-Elijah Sneddon of OMG! Ubuntu! writes that the Ubuntu Touch web browser finally has its own, unique User Agent string of “Ubuntu”. Joey-Elijah says although many websites will ignore the identifier, the experience of viewing the web with Ubuntu Touch will become much nicer in the future.

http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2013/11/ubuntu-touch-browser-finally-given-unique-user-agent-string

==== 5 of the Best Paid Apps in Ubuntu Software Center ====

Jun Auza of Tech``Source writes that Ubuntu does pretty much what any other desktop can do, including watching movies and playing games. Auza says with the growing demand for Ubuntu, developers are coming up with interesting software. Auza lists five apps now, available from the Ubuntu Software Center, that he considers are worth paying for: Machinarium, Braid, Steelstorm, Oil Rush, and Stormcloud.

http://www.junauza.com/2013/11/best-paid-apps-in-ubuntu-software-center.html

==== Ubuntu is back with Saucy Salamander! ====

Dedoimedo writes that Ubuntu has had two underwhelming releases since Pangolin but decided to give Ubuntu another spin and notes that Ubuntu 13.10 boots with a familiar desktop interface, the Dash and search quality have been improved, and resource usage has gone down. Dedoimedo illustrates the article with a number of screenshots to demonstrate his experience and concludes "Only a few tiny niggles here and there, but nothing major. Massive. 9.8/10. Unexpected. Welcome back, Ubuntu, you haZ been missed. Anyhow, Saucy Salamander is a wicked good distro, you should definitely give it a try."
