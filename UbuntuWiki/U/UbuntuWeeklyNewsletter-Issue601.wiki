==== Stress testing CPU temperatures ====

Colin King helps educate us on stress testing CPU temperatures. Providing a study he made on various devices, from a r.pi.2 through to xeon cpus, he gives a very detailed table of how hot various cpu configurations got during 60 seconds of specific types of processing. Colin's conclusion from the detail provided in his study is there is no one way that can be used to stress test CPUs for all architectures, but stress-ng provides the flexibility, with its large suite of methods, to do it for you with the right choice.
