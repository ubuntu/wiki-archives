==== Two weeks with Sol's solar-powered laptop ====

Mariella Moon of Engadget reviews Sol’s new solar-powered laptop, which comes pre-installed with Ubuntu. It’s a hefty 6+ pounds, due in large part to the 2+ pound solar array which can be detached from the top of the lid. Its overall performance leaves something to be desired, though not surprising, given the price ($375-400).
