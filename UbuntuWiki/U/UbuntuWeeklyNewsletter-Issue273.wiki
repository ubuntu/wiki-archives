==== Jonathan Carter: Facebook ads for MOTU? ====

Jonathan Carter writes about ways how to attract more people to Ubuntu as a MOTU and discusses his experience with a Facebook ad where he states: “The ad was displayed a total of 20,661 times. That’s what Facebook considers it’s “outreach”. So out of the 129,520 users who were targeted, it was displayed for 20,661 of them.  59 people clicked on the link (that’s about as far as you can get with $25). 

Did it get more people interested in contributing to Ubuntu? I have no idea. This experiment was mostly to see what $25 gets you in ads.”

Carters says he still prefers Google+ as the way for attracting more people to Ubuntu since, as he writes, there are more geeky people who are eager to share information.

==== James Henstridge: u1ftp: a demonstration of the Ubuntu One API ====

James Henstridge shares a small program he wrote to showcase the power of the Ubuntu One API. The program makes a users’ files available via a FTP daemon running on localhost, meaning that a users’ files can be made available by use of a file manager or FTP client without needing the actual Ubuntu One client installed.

=== Canonical News ===

http://www.canonical.com/about-canonical/news-and-events/events/2012/07/12/live-webinar/ubuntu-server-1204-fast-and-flexible

=== In The Press ===

==== Why Google and Ubuntu don't say “Linux” ====

Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols of ZDNet has some thoughts of why Ubuntu and Google “don’t use the “L” word” and writes  “You see this isn't about reality. It's about perception. Canonical and Google rather than try to fight how Linux is seen by most people ... have chosen to dodge the Linux brand issue entirely.”

http://www.zdnet.com/why-google-and-ubuntu-dont-say-linux-7000000221/

==== Shuttleworth: Why Windows 8 made us ditch GPL Linux loader ====

Gavin Clarke of The Register reports on Mark Suttleworth’s explanation as to why they decided to switch from the GPL licensed GRUB2 boot loader to Intel’s efilinux. Clarke writes: “According to Shuttleworth, this decision was taken because there is too much uncertainty surrounding the terms of the FSF's GPL v3 and its implications for Ubuntu's secret signing key.”

http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/07/06/shuttleworth_responds_uefi/

=== In The Blogosphere ===

==== Does Ubuntu Need More “Apps”? ====

The VAR Guy shares thoughts about the tech ecosystem that is pushing “App” development and Canonical’s own recent push to add more “Apps” to the Ubuntu operating system. He expresses concern over changing Ubuntu’s packaging and software-distribution system to accommodate the new “App” developers. 

http://www.thevarguy.com/2012/07/01/does-ubuntu-need-more-apps/

==== Ubuntu Security: Is There a Threat? ====

Matt Hartley of Datamation writes about some of the threats that exist on Ubuntu (and Linux) when it comes to keeping the system secure. Hartley covers the danger of unknown commands, antivirus software to help protect Windows systems your Linux machine may share a network with: firewalls, file sharing, updates and encryption and more. 

http://www.datamation.com/open-source/ubuntu-security-is-there-a-threat-1.html

==== Software Updater updated with refreshed look in Ubuntu 12.10 ====

Razvi of iloveubuntu.com covers the renaming of Update Manager to Software Updater, including screenshots of style changes also made with this new version.

http://iloveubuntu.net/software-updater-updated-refreshed-look-ubuntu-1210

==== Ubuntu Shaped Crop Circles Appear in Italy ====

Joey Sheddon, OMG! Ubuntu,  posts about Ubuntu-shaped impressions which appeared in wheat fields in Italy. There are questions about who could have possibly done it. Sheddons states: ”So what is causing the grain-groping geometry? UFOs? Aliens? Pranksters? The answer as to what is making them – and why they chose to draw the Ubuntu logo – remains a mystery.”

http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2012/07/ubuntu-shaped-crop-circles-appear-in-italy

==== ARM Wrestling: Fedora 17 vs. Ubuntu Linux ====

Michael Larabel of Phoronix installs ARM versions of Fedora and Ubuntu on a Panda``Board and shares benchmarks. He concludes “While Fedora 17 on ARM is progressing nicely, unfortunately due to the OMAP4460 PandaBoard ES not being properly supported with its default kernel for the PandaBoard, the performance is sub-par to Ubuntu. However, as ARM hardware becomes increasingly common for low-powered desktops, it will be interesting to see how the major Linux distributions wrestle it out on the ARM front.”

==== Red Hat & Ubuntu’s UEFI solutions not good for FOSS ====

Chris Hall of FOSS Force writes about concerns with both Red Hat and Ubuntu’s UEFI solutions, and says “Instead of cooperating with Microsoft’s bid to put a lock on the operating system market, we should be fighting them. For starters, it would appear there are some antitrust issues that could possibly be pursued. Maybe Google could put some pressure on companies making Android ARM devices to just say no to Secure Boot without an easy-to-use “off” button.”

=== In Other News ===

==== 4 Fine Linux ARM Distros ====
