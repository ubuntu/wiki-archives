==== Ubuntu 12.10 (Quantal Quetzal) released! ====

Kate Stewart, Ubuntu Release Manager at Canonical, announces the the release of Ubuntu 12.10 Quantal Quetzal. The release highlights innovations in server, cloud, and desktop versions of Ubuntu. More information on those highlights can be found at:

* http://www.canonical.com/content/ubuntu-server-1210-all-you-need-cloud
* http://www.canonical.com/content/ubuntu-1210-breaks-down-barrier-between-pc-and-web

Stewart noted in the release announcement that, “The newest Kubuntu 12.10, Edubuntu 12.10, Xubuntu 12.10, Lubuntu 12.10 and Ubuntu Studio 12.10 are also released.  More details can be found in their announcements:”

==== Not the Runty Raccoon, the Rufflered Rhino or (even) the Randall Ross ====

Mark Shuttleworth, founder of Ubuntu, announced on his blog the new codename for Ubuntu 13.04--the “Raring Ringtale". Shuttleworth also posted some of the goals that are to be achieved in the following two cycles before the LTS version of Ubuntu 14.04 is released.

http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/1195

==== Raring community skunkworks ====

Mark Shuttleworth, founder of Ubuntu, reinforces the openness of Ubuntu development in this blog post. “This would provide early community input and review, without spoiling the surprise when we think the piece is ready. It would allow community members to work on something that will be widely covered at release (at least, on OMG)," wrote Shuttleworth.

http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/1200

==== “in addition to” ====

Unfortunately, Mark Shuttleworth’s invitation for contributors from Ubuntu community and announcement for Ubuntu being even more open was misunderstood. A lot of people understood Shuttleworth’s post as if Ubuntu’s development is becoming less transparent. Due to the misunderstanding, Shuttleworth wrote another post where he explains his intentions with the original announcement, “What I offered to do, yesterday, spontaneously, is to invite members of the community in to the things we are working on as personal projects, before we are ready to share them. This would mean that there was even less of Ubuntu that was NOT shaped and polished by folk other than Canonical – a move that one would think would be well received. This would make Canonical even more transparent.”

==== Welcome New Members and Developers ====

==== Ubuntu TV Weekly Update #11 ====

Jim Hoddap of Canonical reports on the current status of the Ubuntu TV project which includes: Nux, Unity 3D, Lenses and scopes, Metadata, and many other areas.

As always, Hoddap puts out a call for volunteers to get involved in the Ubuntu TV project with the following, “If you want to get involved, please leave us a comment below so multiple people aren’t working independently on the same things.”

http://www.doadjustyourset.com/2012/10/15/ubuntu-tv-weekly-update-11/

==== Ubuntu TV: Call for More Active Community Participation ====

Jim Hoddap of Canonical and the entire Ubuntu TV team put out a call for more active community participation. Hoddap states that there are three specific ways the community can immediately help the Ubuntu TV project:

* Re-creating the TV user interface using the Nux toolkit (Unity 3D) instead of Qt/QML (Unity 2D).
* Integrating a full MythTV backend into the TV UI, meaning live TV tuning (EPG) and recording infrastructure.
* Researching and finalizing the hardware acceleration of GStreamer video sinks for nVidia, Intel and AMD graphic cards.

==== Jono Bacon: Ubuntu Server Community, You Rule ====

Jono Bacon writes about his experience with “upgrading a four-year old Ubuntu installation to a current installation via SSH without problem.”

==== Jorge Castro: Announcing the Juju web UI ====

Jorge Castro reports on the new Juju web interface which was demoed at the Open``Stack Developer Summit by Mark Shuttleworth. Castro states, “While Juju command line is great for building your own deployment, when you have little boxes you can drag around and connect together it enables people to really model things in a quick and easy manner.”  The Juju GUI code can be retrieved from the following link: http://launchpad.net/juju-gui  The demo of Juju GUI can be found at the following link: http://uistage.jujucharms.com:8080

==== Matt Fischer: UBUNTU-BUG IS FOR LIGHTDM, SOON! ====

Matt Fischer reports about bug triage and a fix of an apport script for lightdm. Fischer writes, “there’s no apport script for any of the the greeters, at least not that he knows of for unity-greeter or lightdm-gtk-greeter, but they’d need the same data. The only thing that this script doesn’t do is get a screencap/picture.”  Fischer also notes that people will be able to file bug reports for lightdm by writing a simple command: ubuntu-bug lightdm

http://www.mattfischer.com/blog/?p=262

==== Randall Ross: The Most Important Thing To Do After You've Installed Ubuntu 12.10 ====

Randall Ross writes about a different type of "thing to do after installing Ubuntu 12.10". He recommends "the only thing you need to do after installing Ubuntu is to install community. Find the people in your town that love it and want it to succeed. Find others that you can talk to face-to-face to share tips, tricks, and your unique knowledge of the amazing things it can do.”

==== Jono Bacon: Growing Our Design Community ====

Jono Bacon blogs about his discussion with Ivo Weevers, head of the Canonical Design Team. "Ivo is passionate about helping the design team at Canonical and the community to work closely together, and we have been discussing what problems we need to solve, and how to resolve them," says Bacon. One of the challenges mention in this post is increasing the Ubuntu Design community and Bacon points out some of the solutions and calls the Ubuntu community to give some feedback.

==== Asus Deploys New Ubuntu Netbooks (Yes, Netbooks) ====

Christoper Tozzi of the Var Guy informs his readers that Asus will be shipping netbooks with Ubuntu preinstalled. For now, netbooks are only available in Germany and Italy.

==== The development of Ubuntu Tweak is stopped ====

Tualatrix Chou, author of the Ubuntu Tweak app announced that development for Ubuntu Tweak has stopped. Chou explained this sudden and unexpected decision with the following, “You may ask why I made this decision to stop the development of Ubuntu Tweak, I may write 10,000 words to describe how I start this project, how I feel happy from this project, how I feel bad from this project… But I just want to say: If making free software is not free any more, why still doing this?”
