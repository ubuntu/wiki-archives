Greetings Ubuntu World!

You already know this, and Mark Shuttleworth's UDS-M keynote confirmed: Ubuntu needs to be '''heard''' and needs to '''spread''' everywhere. It needs to be a meme. It needs to "cross the chasm".

The Ubuntu Vancouver Local Community shares Mark's vision and proudly announces something designed to spread and to startle the world into noticing Ubuntu: the '''Ubuntini'''.

The '''Ubuntini''' is available as both a cocktail and a mocktail. It's lively. It's beautiful. It's delicious. We've chosen our colours with care. We've even included Tang, that savoury sweet drink mix enjoyed everywhere by cosmonauts and normal humans alike.

The next time you're in a bar, a lounge, or at a party please have your friendly bartender mix you an '''Ubuntini'''. Gather your friends. Raise a glass and have a hearty cheer: "Oo-boon-too!" The world will notice. The rest will follow.

Mark, we are truly inspired by your leadership, your ethos, and your project. Thank you for all you have done and for all that you will do. The '''Ubuntini: Inspired by Ubuntu. Dedicated to Mark Shuttleworth.'''

The '''Ubuntini'''  <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ubuntini?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=ubuntini_card_final.jpg|recipe and product card]]</nowiki> are hereby released free to the world on this day, Tuesday May 18th 2010, from Vancouver Canada. 

Cheers,<<BR>>
