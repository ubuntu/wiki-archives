=== Summary ===

Display daily tips for helping new (and experienced) users make the most of their Ubuntu system.

=== Rationale ===

=== Use cases ===

=== Scope ===

=== Design ===

I have made a bash script using zenity that works. It would, however, be better with a real "Tip of the day" application which could start on first boot and then have the checkbox "Do not display this again" added.

=== Implementation ===

==== Code ====

maxrows=0
while read line
do
	number=${line:0:6}
	content[number]=${line:7}
	let "maxrows += 1"
done

RANDOM=$$
thistip=$RANDOM
let "thistip %= maxrows"

for numb in $(seq 0 $maxrows)
do
	if [ $numb = $thistip ] 
	then
		zenity --title "Ubuntu daily tip" --info --text "${content[numb]}"
	fi
done

exit 0

==== Data preservation and migration ====

=== Outstanding issues ===

=== BoF agenda and discussion ===
* It would be great to think about using this as a way of including information from: EthicalInfo.
* i18n, please!
