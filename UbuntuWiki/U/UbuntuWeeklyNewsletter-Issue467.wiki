==== Ubuntu App Developer Blog: The versioning of the Ubuntu UI Toolkit ====

Zoltán Balogh tells us of UITK version 1.3. Previously the UITK targeted touch devices, but with this version it will support not just any screen size; but also keyboard & mouse (missing from prior versions). Lots of bug fixes are included; and the API will be supported for 1 minor release, so until 1.5 at a minimum.

==== Bryan Quigley: Ubuntu 16.04 LiveCD Memory Usage Compared ====

Bryan Quigley has conducted an analysis of memory usage among various flavor versions of Ubuntu 16.04. He concludes that while Lubuntu is the most efficient in terms of memory usage, he also asserts that memory limited users should change flavors rather than changing to a 32-bit version.

==== Kubuntu - Kubuntu Party 4 – The Gathering of Halflings ====

The Kubuntu Team announces the next Kubuntu party coming up on Friday, June 17th. “The party theme is all about digging out those half finished projects we’ve all got lying around our Geekdoms, and fetching them along for a Show ‘n’ Tell. As ever, there will be party fun and games, an opportunity to kick back from all the contributing that we do, so join us and enjoy good company and laughter.”

==== Is Ubuntu's Convergence the Future of Linux? ====

Bruce Byfield writing for Datamation reflects upon the vision of Ubuntu Convergence, a single software platform across devices. He expresses skepticism as to whether convergence is really a desired feature for most users and his expectation that it’s most valuable for folks who travel a lot, writing: “For those who travel, or move from site to site during their work day, convergence should be exactly what they are looking for.”

==== Ubuntu BQ Aquaris M10 Review – Part 1: Hardware ====

JC Torres of Slash``Gear reviews the hardware of the bq Aquaris M10, covering the technical specs, hardware design, performance, display, battery life, camera and speakers. He concludes: “When it comes to hardware, the bq Aquaris M10 can perhaps be best described as something that ‘Just Works’. That can be taken both ways. On the one hand, it has a no fuss approach to features, with hardware that performs decently for the price you are paying for it. On the other hand, it also means that, as far as hardware and design is concerned, the tablet is unexciting and unassuming. Depending on your particular inclination, that might very well be your cup of tea.”

==== Hands-on with Ubuntu MATE 16.04 on the Raspberry Pi 2 and 3 ====

J.A. Watson for ZDNet reviews Ubuntu MATE 16.04 on the Raspberry Pi 2 and 3, walking through several gotchas he found during installation. Once booted, he explores the system and reports that “Ubuntu MATE on the Raspberry Pi 3 is honestly quite pleasant. It boots very quickly” and writing of the Pi 2 that “even on the slower model is not distractingly bad.” He concludes “ Some people (including me) might argue that there are really not many (or any) significant advantages of Ubuntu MATE over Raspbian, but even I can't deny that MATE looks more polished, and if you are accustomed to Ubuntu in general or MATE in particular, then this distribution is the way to go.”
