==== Recaping the Bug Jam and Squashing Party in Portland, OR ====

Ubuntu Oregon Lo``Co Team Lead,  Benjamin Kerensa, discusses the results of the first joint Ubuntu/Debian event held in Portland, Oregon where attendees spent the day learning about packaging, multiarch implementation and SRU verification.

Debian Developer and Ubuntu contributor Kees Cook also in attendance at this event discussed how he used EC2 instances to deploy build environments.

Steve Langasek, Debian Developer and Ubuntu Foundation Team Manager was on scene as well and in the link below writes about the the successes of this first combined Ubuntu/Debian event. “When all was said and done, we didn't get a chance to tackle any wheezy release critical bugs like we'd hoped. That's ok, that leaves us something to do for our next event, which will be bigger and even better than this one. Maybe even big enough to rival one of those crazy, all-weekend BSPs that they have in Germany..., “ concludes Langasek.

See the links below for more information on the ins and outs of this first time Ubuntu/Debian event in Portland, Oregon.
