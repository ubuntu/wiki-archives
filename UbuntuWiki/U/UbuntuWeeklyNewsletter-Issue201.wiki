==== Ubuntu Closes Root Hole ====

User crve, of h-online, discusses a security flaw that was fixed earlier this week.

crve writes, "A flaw in the module pam_motd (message of the day), which displays the daily motto and other information after login (to the shell), can be exploited under Ubuntu to expand access rights. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to gain root access. Ubuntu has already provided a patch for the flaw. Operators of multi-users systems should install it as soon as possible because directions are already in circulation via Twitter on how to exploit the flaw to get access rights to the password file /etc/shadow. The file can then not only be read, but changed.""

crve, also states, "According to the developers, the problem only occurs on Ubuntu; other Linux systems are reportedly not affected. Ubuntu has remedied the flaw by taking root rights away from the module for access to the file motd.legal-notice (under .cache)."

=== Launchpad News ===

==== New Launchpad Bugs Status: Opinion ====

From the Launchpad Blog, the new Launchpad bug status "opinion" is explained. The status 'opinion' means there is a difference of opinion around a particular bug and people are free to continue the discussion, but the project or package maintainers need to move to other work and are considering the issue closed. The idea is that bugs can be marked closed, so developers arent wasting time on the them, but discussion can still be on-going. This status 'opinion' is considered an experiment, and will be closely monitored over the next 3 months.

Web``Upd8 writes about the patched NotifyOSD PPA, wchich was updated to allow further customization. Now you can display notifications in different corners of the screen and it fixes the time out option.

==== Using Bazaar on Subversion Repositories ====

Raoul says "Soon after I started developing version 2.0 of OpenLP, we moved OpenLP over to Launchpad.net and started using Bazaar for our version control. Over the last (nearly) 2 years of using Bazaar, I've really come to enjoy working with it, and the workflow that the Bazaar integration in Launchpad offers. At work we use Subversion for our version control, and some of Subversion's limitations, compared to Bazaar's features, have been annoying me for a while. Then I learned about the Bazaar-Subversion bridge, and I started using Bazaar to checkout my code from Subversion."

How does it work? Read further on his site to find out:

==== Getting Amarok running in Ubuntu 10.04 ====

In this article, Matthew Casperson shares how to make Amarok 'play nice' in Ubuntu 10.04. Screenshots, installation instructions, and instructions on what other software needs to be installed are meticulously documented. Also, specific tips for setting up Amarok in gnome and ways to deal with KDE specific challenges. "When discussing the merits of KDE vs Gnome, Amarok is one of those applications that gives the KDE guys some ammunition. I don't blame them, because it is a kick ass media player. But with a few small tweaks you can have Amarok up and running in your Gnome based Ubuntu desktop as if it were a native application".
