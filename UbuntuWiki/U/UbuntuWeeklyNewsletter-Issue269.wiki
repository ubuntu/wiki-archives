=== LoCo News ===

==== Real collaborative design with open source software ====

Martin Albisetti shares news of the recent Ubuntu conference in Buenos Aires, Argentina, which they plan on now making a regional conference with the help of the Uruguay Lo``Co.

=== Launchpad News ===

==== Launchpad for textual, graphical, and interactive browsers ====

Curtis Hovey gives a thorough review of Launchpad visibility issues (textual, graphical and interactive) in different browsers. Hovey stated: ”There are inconsistencies in pages you might visit. Some parts might not work because Launchpad does not have a ‘proven way’ to solve a problem.” Hovey highly recommends that users should use interactive browsers since they provide information as needed, and best performance to complete the task.

=== Ubuntu Cloud News ===

==== Scaling a 2000-node Hadoop cluster on EC2/Ubuntu with Juju ====

Mark Mims and James Page share their scalability test framework on Hadoop using Juju Charms. They also share the steps of their scalability testing process in a very detailed manner. 

Their framework plan includes:

* pick  service that scales
* spin up a cluster of units for this service
* try to run it in a way that actively engages all units of a cluster
* repeat: instrument, profile, optimize, grow

http://daniel.holba.ch/blog/2012/06/you-can-help-code-review/

==== Ubuntu App Developer Blog: Humble Indie Bundle: a few days later and Help Earn the Humble Indie Bundle More Money! ====

They list out 10 most downloaded apps in May (paid and free): 

* Paid: Braid, Oil Rush, BIT.TRIP RUNNER, World of Goo, Linux Format Magazine - Issue 158 - Beat the CIA, Steel Storm: Burning retribution, Fluendo DVD player, The journey down: chapter one, Linux Format Magazine - Issue 159 - Ubuntu vs. Windows and Family Farm

http://www.jonobacon.org/2012/06/06/download-for-ubuntu-button-campaign/

==== Michael Hall: Contributing to Ubuntu: A better Pkgme ====

Michael Hall calls for back-end contributors to James Westby’s pkgme utility, giving very detailed instructions for new contributors. Hall states: “Currently there is a support for apps using Python and Distutils, apps compiled by cmake and apps written in Vala. But there are still many, many applications out there  that aren’t covered with these back-ends, including: Qt apps, HTML5 apps, Flash apps and more. That’s where you, dear contributor, come in.”

http://mhall119.com/2012/06/contributing-to-ubuntu-a-better-pkgme/

==== Thorsten Wilms: Switches in Unity menus ====

Thorsten Wilms shares plans considering switch widgets in Unity’s network status menu. He notes that enabling/disabling could be handled differently in style and placement of the widgets and that the adoption of “light-switch” style widgets in point and click interfaces is a mistake as they are often unclear about whether labels refer to the current state or the state to change to. 

http://thorwil.wordpress.com/2012/06/07/switches-in-unity-menus/

==== Ubuntu Classroom: A few instructor spots left for Ubuntu User Days on June 23-24th 2012 ====

http://blog.ubuntu-women.org/2012/06/ubuntu-women-at-uds-q/

==== Accessibility Team: The Year of GNOME Accessibility ====

The Ubuntu Accessibility team shares news of a new campaign launched by upstream GNOME Accessibility for improvements "including performance improvements when the desktop accessibility APIs are turned on, enhancements to the readability of WebKitGTK+ and improvements to automatic regression testing which ties in nicely with the renewed emphasis on QA and automated testing in the Ubuntu project." They go on to share an easy way you can help by fixing some bugs the "a11y" tag, which was recently added harvest.ubuntu.com.
