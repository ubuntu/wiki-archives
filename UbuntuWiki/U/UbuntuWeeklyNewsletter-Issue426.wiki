==== Clarification on IP Rights Policy ====

Jane Silber writes: “We are updating our Intellectual Property Rights Policy to clarify the relationship between this policy and the licences of the constituent works in Ubuntu.” She quotes in full a paragraph that has been added to the policy, says that Canonical are proud to have chosen the GPL as their default licence, and thanks the Free Software Foundation and the Software Freedom Conservancy for their suggestions over the past year.

Additionally, the FSF has also issued a statement: https://www.fsf.org/news/canonical-updated-licensing-terms
