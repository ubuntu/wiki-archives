Ubuntu Studio is a multimedia editing/creation flavor of Ubuntu, built for the
GNU/Linux audio, video, and graphics enthusiast or professional.

The Ubuntu Studio team is proud to announce its fifth release: Ubuntu Studio
9.04. With this release, which you can download in a 1.2GB DVD,
Ubuntu Studio offers a pre-made selection of packages, targeted at audio, video
and graphics users. Ubuntu Studio greatly simplifies the creation of Linux-based
multimedia workstations.

For Ubuntu Studio 9.04 we have continued to update packages and fix critical
bugs to better the Ubuntu Studio user experience.

We are happy to announce the real time kernel will be installed by default in
Ubuntu Studio in this release, if the audio task is selected. We have tested it
heavily and are happy with it's performance in audio environments.

The art has had a cool facelift. The gtk theme has been improved staying in the 
'Studio' style. Plus the gdm theme has been switched to some great new eyecandy.

New applications included:
* FFADO firewire soundcard drivers
* Calf audio plugins
* LMMS (updated and included in the meta packages) 

Features/Fixes/Improvements:
* Heavily tested 2.6.28 realtime kernel for low-latency audio work
* Jack Connection Kit upgraded to 0.116.1 (a major improvement)
* Ardour upgraded to 2.7.1
* Fresh ubuntustudio-looks improvements
* Addition to Ubuntu Studio Controls to allow users to maintain 
   Ctr+Alt+Backspace behavior 

See the Ubuntu release notes for other non Ubuntu Studio specific changes.

See http://calf.sourceforge.net/ for more information about CALF.

As our wiki page at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuStudio states, "our
aim is to make it more accessible for new users to get into the tools that
GNU/Linux has to offer for multimedia creation and production. We also want to
spotlight what's out there, and show users tools they might not know to exist."

Thanks to all who helped in Ubuntu Studio 9.04's creation!
