As of writing this post, the Ubuntu 12.04 Beta 2 release was a week away and the archive was put in hard freeze to prepare for it. During the freeze, all uploads to main must be approved by a member of the release team, so if you have fixes which are important to get in, please get in touch as soon as possible (and preferably, get your packages uploaded in parallel!).

==== Is Ubuntu Global Jam an Event for Me? ====

Charlene Tessier writes about her experience being the lead for her area's Ubuntu Global Jam event. "Well, first I was told there is a theme – Jam (stuff you put on bread) and Jammies (aka pajamas)? What kind of tech event is this? But that’s not all. Let’s make it [a] day event with a variety of different activities for all levels of participation," wrote Tessier. "Did anything happen with the theme you ask?" You will have to read the blog post to find out.

http://lococouncil.ubuntu.com/2012/03/21/egypt-loco-approved/

=== Launchpad News ===

==== Why there is always time ====

Dan Harrop-Griffiths explains why there is always time for usability testing. Testing methods can range from very simple to very complex, and setting up "basic tests with a handful of users, running them and then writing up the results doesn’t need to take more than a day or two."

=== Ubuntu Cloud News ===

==== s.fox: An Interview with lovinglinux ====

lovinglinux talks about becoming interested in computers, Linux and Ubuntu; “I started to play with computers in early 80’s, when my parents gave me a TK 85, an unlicensed ZX81 clone. But it wasn’t until the early 90’s, when I entered the University, that I would start using PC’s as we know today, mostly for research and entertainment. I don’t know exactly when I became interested in Linux, but I remember a few unsuccessful attempts to use some distributions that I received with computer magazines, until I came in contact with Ubuntu Hardy Heron, back in 2008. I guess many users like me were drawn to Ubuntu because of Vista. Never looked back since then.”

==== Jeremy Bicha: Ubuntu Docs: A Call for Help ====

http://blogs.kde.org/node/4547

==== Canonical Design Team: The Pangolin wallpaper selection takes flight ====

For another cycle a selection of images has been put forward for inclusion in Ubuntu. As there have been some questions on other blogs about the process, I thought it was worth doing a quick refresher. Each release we ask the community contributors whose images were included in the last release if they’d like to help choose the images that should go into the upcoming release.

=== In The Press ===

==== Ubuntu Linux and Canonical Moving Forward, Two Years After Leadership Change ====

Sean Michael Kerner of Internet News.com writes "It's a move that today in 2012 is still working out well for Ubuntu and Canonical. I recently got the chance to chat with Silber and she told me point blank that there is no way she is going back to her former position at Canonical, she's loves her job as CEO too much."

http://www.internetnews.com/blog/skerner/ubuntu-linux-and-canonical-moving-forward.html

==== Say Hello to Canonical's new Linux desktop: Ubuntu 12.04 beta review ====

Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols of zdnet opines about his experience with Ubuntu 12.04 beta. Vaughan-Nichols writes, "Canonical’s next long-term support release of its flagship Linux distribution, Ubuntu 12.04 is in late beta. This next release, due out on April 26th, is in beta now. I’ve been using it for several weeks now and so far, so good." He continues, "I rather like Unity as well. What Ubuntu’s developers have really been doing with this release is not so much getting HUD ready, as they have been cleaning Unity up and getting it ready for business users."

==== Why Linux is Dead on the Desktop ====

PCWorld Writer Tony Bradley opines about why he feels that Linux cannot compete on the desktop, and cites his struggle and effort to try to use Ubuntu for a month as a factor.

==== Ubuntu 12.04 to be without Wubi installer ====

Sam Osborne of imediamonkey discusses the proposed removal of Wubi in Ubuntu 12.04. Osborne writes, "For those unaware, Wubi (Windows-based UBuntu Installer) allows the user to install Ubuntu alongside Windows, without having to partition their hard drive. Put simply, the installer adds an extra boot option at boot up – giving users the option to boot into either Windows or Ubuntu." The article reveals that one of the reasons for this move is to make it possible for Wubi to be maintained and enhanced outside the Ubuntu development cycle.
