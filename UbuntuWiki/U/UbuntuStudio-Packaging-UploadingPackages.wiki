__TOC__


== Development Release Uploads ==

Before the final beta freeze of a development release, getting a package into the archive can be done in a matter of hours. You just upload it, when you have tested it and make sure it works locally.

=== After Final Beta Freeze ===

After final beta freeze, if a package is included in one of the official flavor ISOs, the package will be stuck in queue for review. (Add more about this here..)

== How to upload ==

Uploading is quite simple. Build the source package, just like you would before uploading to a PPA. Then, just do:

  $ dput ../<changes-file>

When using no argument for dput, it will use the Ubuntu archive url by default (on Ubuntu installations only).
