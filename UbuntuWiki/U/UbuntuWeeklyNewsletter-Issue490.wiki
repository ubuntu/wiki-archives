==== Taking a stand against unofficial Ubuntu images ====

Mark Shuttleworth writes how Ubuntu is a major component in the cloud with AWS, Azure, Google, Rackspace, Soft``Layer and more. Canonical however is in dispute with an unnamed EU cloud provider shipping "insecure and broken" images, where attempts to modify their behavior have failed. The post discusses how Canonical is working to defend the integrity of the Ubuntu name by working with these companies and through legal means to make sure users are confident that images are secure when they have the Ubuntu name.

==== Zygmunt Krynicki: Ubuntu Core Gadget Snaps ====

Zygmunt Krynicki tells us about gadget snaps which are not very familiar to those of us on desktops but are found on all snap core devices such as IoT. He says that these snaps can be found at github.com/snapcore with the pattern 'devicename-gadget', and are mirrored on Launchpad. The wiki link included in the article provides further information.

==== Harald Sitter: Snapping KDE Applications ====

Harald Sitter shares a video on Snapping KDE Applications, but also writes for those who prefer to read. He reminds us of KDE's 20 year history which along with the framework model can be a challenge. Harald says that with Snapcraft, Flatpak et al. packaged-apps in these formats can be large and to solve this problem KDE Frameworks 5 now uses content snaps which reduced a KCalc app snap from 70MiB to 32KiB. He concludes his article with a "howto" using KAlgebra as an example with includes full yaml code and the necessary snap commands.

==== You Can Now Package Your Apps as Snaps Without Bundling Their Dependencies ====

Marius Nestor, writing for Softpedia, informs us of the recent availability of the ubuntu-app-platform snap which allows developers to package their apps as Snaps without the need to build all of the dependencies. He says that an updated Snapcraft version will be made available soon and quotes Canonical’s Olivier Tilloy as saying that the size of the webbrowser-app snap has been reduced from 136MB to 22MB.

==== This Is The Release Date for Ubuntu 17.04 ‘Zesty Zapus’ ====

==== Ubuntu Prepping Its 16.04 "Rolling HWE Kernel" ====

Michael Larabel, writing for Phoronix writes that starting with Ubuntu 16.04.2, the LTS (Long term Support) releases are switching to a concept of a “rolling HWE kernel.” He quotes Leann Ogasawara as saying: “Essentially, consumers of an HWE kernel will automatically be upgraded to the next HWE kernel offered in subsequent point releases until reaching the final HWE Kernel offered in 16.04.5." Michael points out that this is not a true rolling kernel but an automatic upgrade with future LTS point releases.

==== Canonical Takes Stand Against Unofficial Ubuntu Images, Reportedly Risky & Insecure ====

Michael Larabel of Phoronix reports on Canonical’s dispute with a European cloud provider who have been "publishing insecure, broken images of Ubuntu" for its cloud customers. He gives us an idea as to the changes that have been made and speculates on the identity of the cloud provider.
