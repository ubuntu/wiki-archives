==== Improved mail server stack: Testing needed ====

During last UDS it was decided to improve the mail server stack available in Ubuntu Server. One of the items that came out of the discussion was a better integration between postfix and dove``cot. Ante Karamatic worked on implementing it for Jaunty and his results have been uploaded. To test it all you need is a jaunty system and install the dovecot-postfix package. Once the installation has completed the following configuration will be available:

* SASL authentication for smtp services
* Dove``cot delivered as the default Local Delivery Agent
* Tls for smtp services

If you’re interested in a integrated mail stack providing a combination of smtp, imap, pop3 and managesieve services, the Jaunty Jackalope will suit you. Have a look at it, install it, and test it. One simple command: apt-get install dovecot-postfix Please let the Ubuntu Server team know about your suggestions and comments here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ServerTeam/Contact

==== Triage in Launchpad suite ====

The Launchpad team is changing the way that they triage bugs reported against the Launchpad suite of applications. The Wishlist importance will no longer be used because the term is not about importance. There is a distinction between the Confirmed and Triaged bug status, namely that any user can confirm a bug, but only a project member can state the bug is in the application’s code. Many bugs in the Launchpad suite of applications are implicitly in the Triaged state because the Launchpad team members have set the importance.

Changes to current bugs:

*** All bugs that were Wishlist importance are now Low importance and are tagged with “feature”.
*** All Confirmed bugs that had a importance of Low, Medium, or High were changed to Triaged.

The Launchpad team also wants to clarify the meaning of Critical, High, Medium, and Low by expressing their definition in practical terms. Some teams do not think Medium is distinguished from Low, so will not use it. The teams that do use Medium importance will use it to create a pool of bugs for release planning — the bugs may be escalated to High or targeted to a release without a commitment to complete them.

You can read "A Practical Guide to Launchpad Bug Triage" to learn more about the reasons for these changes. https://dev.launchpad.net/BugTriage

http://blog.launchpad.net/bug-tracking/triage-in-launchpad-suite

==== PPA page performance improvements ====

Last week was the first of the Launchpad Performance Weeks that are being started to improve performance. The Soyuz team worked hard on improving the performance of the PPA page, which had a tendency to be very slow, or even time out on PPAs that have a lot of binaries published. The more observant of you will have noticed that the PPA page on edge is now using asynchronous requests to fetch both the “Repository disk usage” section, and the package information section that is expanded when you click on the triangle at the left of each source package row. This means that the initial page load time is a lot quicker! There’s still some more speed we can get out of the page by reducing the query load that it places on the database server, and we’ll deliver that change soon.

A major overhaul of the PPA page is in the pipeline. Watch out for that soon!

==== Netbooks: A Curse or a Blessing in an Imploding PC Market? ====

From the Technology section of the New York Times, Ashlee Vance reports that, though the Netbook market has been blamed for the fall-off of PC sales, the sale of PCs had actually slumped before Netbooks arrived on the market.  Couple that with the lower cost of processors, the lack of need for high-end graphics, and the use of Linux on Netbooks, and you have a formula for making money - just not as much money as the companies used to make.  Hewlett-Packard is one of the latest to join the Linux migration.  HP has taken Ubuntu and modified it by stripping out the branding and creating their own startup screen for the Mini 1000 Mi Edition computer.  This provides people with the ability to access photos, e-mail, music and the Internet.  Ashlee believes that other PC makers will also try fresh approaches, and that such work should eventually reach standard laptops and PCs and benefit consumers.

==== Ubuntu and the new user ====

Pete Graner has just converted his wife Amber to Ubuntu. She was an avid Windows user that he managed to get onto Macs, but that was as far as she would go. Now, Pete is a Canonical employee, and he's gotten Amber to try Ubuntu 8.10. Amber is an average housewife who, according to her doctor, is human. Being diagnosed as human, she wanted to try the "Linux for Human Beings" - Ubuntu. She started the install of Ubuntu on a Dell Inspiron 6400, and in less than 2 hours found herself able to connect to the Internet, connect to a color laser printer wirelessly, get to her website, get to Face``Book, access classes at Dayton, and write her blog. You can read about her "Ubuntu" adventures on her blog here: http://amber.redvoodoo.org/

==== Ubuntu spawns new generation ====

In just the few years since it was released, Ubuntu Linux has inspired tens of new Linux distributions. Here we look at five of the best. In just the few years that Ubuntu Linux has been around it has become one of the most popular Linux versions available, ahead of others such as Red Hat, Suse and Mandriva. Ubuntu is not only a popular distribution in its own right, but it has spawned a new generation of Linux versions that use its underlying code to build versions for particular interest groups. Apart from the official Ubuntu derivatives such as Xubuntu, Kubuntu and Edubuntu, there are tens of other distributions built around the Ubuntu community. http://mybroadband.co.za/news/Software/6933.html

==== Life with Ubuntu ====

A blogger from Bent corner recounts his continuing experiences from his recent install of Ubuntu to replace his install of windows XP. His HP Pavillion dv6000 has the AMD turion 64 bit processor which lead him to the choice of installing Ubuntu 64-bit. He was having trouble getting important things to work, like youtube videos. This led him to install Ubuntu 32-bit to see if that improved his experience. Because of a storm in his area, there were power dips that caused his wireless router to reset to it's default settings which made it interesting to find his wireless network. Once he got that problem fixed he was able to install Ubuntu 32-bit, and was able to install programs like wine that he had difficulty installing before on the 64-bit version. http://bentcorner.com/2009/02/life-with-ubuntu/

==== HP Mini Mi screenshots ====

M Freitas provides screenshots of his HP Mini Mi along with a brief description of his feelings about it.  This is his first Ubuntu computer, and he has found the experience really interesting.  He has even gained the interest of a couple of lawyers, friends of his, who are interested in using it when they're on the move.  Even his parents-in-law are interested.

=== Meeting Summaries ===

==== Server Team Meeting Feb.10th ====

Here are the minutes of the meeting. They can also be found online with the irc logs here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MeetingLogs/Server/20090210.

* SRU for ebox: mathiaz reported that the relevant ebox packages for the intrepid SRU had been uploaded to the intrepid-proposed pocket. They're waiting to be accepted by the archive team.

* Screen profiles: kirkland announced that a new version of the screen-profile package had been uploaded to the archive. Some new features have been added (ec2-cost estimator for the status bar) as well as the usual round of bug fixes. He considers screen-profiles to be feature complete for Jaunty. A PPA[1] has been created to provide screen and screen-profiles packages for intrepid and hardy. Testing is welcome. [1]: https://edge.launchpad.net/~screen-profiles/+archive/ppa

* Update Server``Guide for Jaunty: sommer mentioned that a few sections of the server guide had been updated. The list is kept in a wiki page[2] and updated sections are marked as needing a review. Help in doing so would be appreciated. [2]: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/JauntyServerGuide

ACTION: sommer to ping mdke about keeping doc.ubuntu.com up-to-date

ACTION: sommer to mark all relevant section as Needs review rather then Done

* Postfix and Dovecot integration: ivoks gave a status of the dovecot/postfix integration planned for jaunty. The goal is to have postfix use the dovecot lda, provide SASL authentication via dovecot and use maildir as the default mail store. After some discussion it was suggested to provide a different dovecot configuration file (dovecot-postfix.conf) and modify dovecot's init script to use it if available instead of the default configuration file.

ACTION: ivoks to prepare a debdiff implementing the proposed solution.

* Power management: kirkland noted that cpu frequently scaling was not enabled in a default server install. He asked whether powernowd should be installed by default by a server install. soren pointed to a thread on ubuntu-server[3] discussing this topic. [3]: https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-server/2008-September/002184.html

kirkland also reported on his suspend and hibernate tests with server hardware: all of them worked beautifully. In the process he wrote up a MIR for the wakeonlan package. He is looking for volunteers to test suspend and hibernate on server hardware.

* Agree on next meeting date and time: Next meeting will be on Tuesday, February 17th at 16:00 UTC in #ubuntu-meeting.
