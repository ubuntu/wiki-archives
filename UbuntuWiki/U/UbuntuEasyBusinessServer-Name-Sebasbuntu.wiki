__TOC__

Every Ubuntu flavor you can spontaneously think of is named something with "buntu" as prefix nowadays.
SBS is a common abbreviation for Small Business Servers.

Logical consequence? Call your easy business server "SBSbuntu".
Yeah, right, doesn't look very well, and is impossible to pronounce.

Solution? Take a well-known Ubuntu developer in order to fill in the vowels, so the name is both descriptive and a pun. Tada... "Sebasbuntu"!
:-P
