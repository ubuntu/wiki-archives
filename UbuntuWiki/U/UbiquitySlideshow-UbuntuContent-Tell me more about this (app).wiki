__TOC__

Every slide should have a way to get more info about that topic/app for those that want to learn more. I have two proposals:

1. A link that shows more information right there and then. Will either make the percieved installation process longer, or make the user miss some of the other slides.

2. A checkbox or something that tells Ubuntu to give the user more information about this after the installation, upon first boot up. This could be confusing, because you ask for more info, but nothing seems to happen. But it could also give better opportunity to give more and better info, and maybe even automatically launch the app in question and show helpful arrows with info on the screen (straight on the screen, connected to the app, not the extra info slide. For example.
