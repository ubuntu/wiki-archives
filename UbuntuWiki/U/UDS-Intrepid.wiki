=== Background ===

At the beginning of a new development cycle, Ubuntu developers from around the world gather to help shape and scope the next release of Ubuntu. The summit is open to the public, but it is '''not a conference''', exhibition or other audience-oriented event. Rather, it is an opportunity for Ubuntu developers -- who usually collaborate online -- to work together in person on specific tasks.

Small groups of developers will participate in short Forum and Workshop (formerly called "BoF"/Birds-of-a-Feather) sessions.  This allow a single project is discussed and documented in a written specification.  These specifications will be used for planning the new release of Ubuntu, as described in FeatureSpecifications and TimeBasedReleases.

=== Attendance ===

If you plan on attending the UDS, please go to https://launchpad.net/sprints/uds-intrepid and register your attendance of the event. To do this, click the "Register Your Attendance" link. A <nowiki>[[UDS-Intrepid/Attendees| detailed list]]</nowiki> that includes the travel details, affiliations and interests of the attendees is also available; feel free to add yourself, especially if you'd like to meet others at the airport and share a taxi.  

If you cannot attend in person, you can still listen to the conferences or take part in them remotely.

To attend a session virtually, you will need to listen to the Icecast, join the gobby session, and chat over IRC.  IRC channels depend on the room the session is in, for instance #uds-community for the Tiber room.  The main IRC channel is #ubuntu-devel-summit

You can also get voip access, if you need to speak.  Join channel #canonical-sysadmin and ask for help.
