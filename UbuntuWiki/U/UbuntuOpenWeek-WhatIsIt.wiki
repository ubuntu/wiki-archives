In just nine years, Ubuntu has become one of the most popular Linux distributions in the world with millions of users and a thriving community. Ever wondered what all the fuss is about? How have we achieved such a great feat in such a short space of time?  Here's where you can find out. Ubuntu Open Week is a week of IRC tuition and Q+A sessions all about getting involved in the rock-and-roll world that is the Ubuntu community. We organise this week for the beginning of a new release cycle to help new contributors get involved.

Ubuntu Open Week is a series of online workshops where you can:

* learn about the Ubuntu landscape
* talk to some of the key developers from the Ubuntu project
* find out about the Community and its relationship with Canonical
* participate in an open Q&A with Mark Shuttleworth, the founder of Ubuntu.
