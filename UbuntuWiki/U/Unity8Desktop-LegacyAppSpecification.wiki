=== Rationale ===

A large pool of existing applications built on Ubuntu and X11 exists and is unlikely to move at a reasonable rate to newer Ubuntu technologies (Unity 8 and Mir). To retain the value proposition of Ubuntu running Unity 8, it is necessary to provide a mechanism to minimally support the existing legacy applications without modification.

This specification outlies the requirements and proposed solutions for providing this mechanism.

=== User stories ===

* a bespoke application used in an educational institution for student-teacher communication
* commercial (closed source) software
* applications packaged for other Linux distros ir Ubuntu flavours

=== Requirements ===

# install unmodified DEB packages into a system-image/click-based environment
# run legacy applications in a contained/isolated environment
# provide an X11 service for the legacy application, running on a Mir surface
# provide a minimum required session environment for the applications (eg. gsettings, environment variables)
# provide startup handshaking for the X server (server/window manager/renderer) and app startup
# provide a helper application to launch and monitor the application (tears down the runtime on application shutdown)

=== Specification Details ===

* have updated x.org+XMir packages available in a PPA 
* push Xmir back end upstream to x.org
* modify DEB installation to use bindmount area and extract .desktop file
* changes for (SIGSTOP) startup sequencing (X11-WM-Renderer)
* create LXC stuff for bindmounting local dirs
* write helper app for launching/monitoring containner
