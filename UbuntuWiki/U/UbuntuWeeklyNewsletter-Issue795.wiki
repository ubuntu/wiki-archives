==== Supporting the LXD Community ====

Aaron Prisk reminds us the LXD project has been brought into 'the fold', which means the Linux``Containers forums are moving to Ubuntu Discourse.

=== In the Press ===

==== Xubuntu is a highly configurable Linux desktop that can be tweaked to your heart's content ====

Jack Wallen starts by giving us examples of how configurable the Xfce desktop is, before moving to how it's presented with Xubuntu. Giving us some details of what we'd find on a Xubuntu system, Jack summarizes Xubuntu's strength as 'flexibility'. He adds that whilst many find it suitable for new users, he doesn't recommend that  due to its extensive configurability; however, one can grow with this desktop.

==== Ubuntu Unity relives Canonical's creativity and brings back one of the best UIs ====

Jack Wallen reminisces about the Unity Desktop which was default for awhile on Ubuntu, and then switches back to GNOME as default. In this article, Jack explores Ubuntu Unity 23.04 which is an official flavor of Ubuntu, and some cool features of the Unity desktop that make it special. Some features that are missing (from Ubuntu 17.04 & earlier when Unity was the default desktop) are mentioned, but also great features like the HUD. Jack mentions some problems he encountered, and suggests we give it a try.

==== Wayland. (Details about the plans for Wayland support for Budgie Desktop) ====

Joshua Strobl 'talks' about "plans for Wayland support" for the Budgie Desktop. With some discussion on the work leading up to the present, a link to a prior update is provided, Joshua talks about various desktops, and Red Hat support for X11 is covered. These lead to express the need to move to Wayland (only) in the future. This is a comprehensive and somewhat technical post, outlining a 'long road' ahead, wherein Budgie 11 will drop support for X11.

==== Canonical takes its LXD 'containervisor' back into the house ====

Liam Proven writes about the Canonical-sponsored Linux Containers project that has now been 'taken in-house', with a link to the FAQ post on Ubuntu's Discourse. We're reminded LXD has been around since 2014, with mention of the older LXC project it relies on in part. Discussion on containers, links to understanding differences in approach (between LXC, LXD and other alternatives) is also provided.

==== China's openKylin 1.0 arrives. Our verdict? Not a bad-looking, er, Ubuntu remix ====

==== Ubuntu 23.10’s New Software App Will Demote DEBs (Apparently) ====

Joey Sneddon writes about the new store, that has been written about before, but is now official. We're told it can be viewed in the immutable Ubuntu desktop images, and is a "snap-first app store". We're told for now the store is snap only, but deb package support will be added in time, with other tools catering for deb package installs. Some discussion on rating is given, as well we are told more will be known as Ubuntu 23.10 continues development. You can look at a preview available now (details provided).

==== Ubuntu ‘Apt News’ Feature Coming to GUI Software Updater ====

Joey Sneddon tells us apt news, which has been seen at terminal for awhile now, will soon be seen in the Software Updater app on GUI desktops. Joey admits the tool "informs users of critical security incidents", and we are told this will include Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (now only an ESM release). Joey reminds us the apt news feature can be disabled, with no date known yet on when this will happen.
