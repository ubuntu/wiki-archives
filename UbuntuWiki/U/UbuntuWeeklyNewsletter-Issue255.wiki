==== Ubuntu 12.04 Development Update ====

The Developer News team writes about the transition of Ubuntu 12.04 from Alpha Testing into the first phase of Beta Testing. Nicholas Skaggs has a number of items you can help out with by simply doing a bit of testing.

Also covered are some reoccurring events (including the new Fix-it Friday) and an interview with community member Benjamin Kerensa who has recently begun to get involved with development. 

The post wraps up with a list of outstanding tasks which need to be completed, several ideas for getting involved, how to find something to work on and getting in touch with Ubuntu developers.

=== In The Press ===

==== Ubuntu's Bold Mobile Gambit ====

Katherine Noyes of Linux``Insider writes about Ubuntu for Android and how it "became clear that the news had struck some kind of chord with observers far and wide, prompting nothing less than a large-scale reconsideration of the current state of computing." Some of the responses were positive towards Canonical and Ubuntu while others just saw this as another attempt to stop Canonical from hemorrhaging money.

==== Ubuntu 12.04 hits beta, brings smooth Unity for marching masses ====

The Register reports on the first beta of the upcoming 12.04 LTS release on Thursday. Among many new features and a much more stable version of Unity, they report that this version looks to have a renewed focus for business with a longer support period and a Business Remix.

=== In The Blogosphere ===

==== Ubuntu for Android Gets Shown Off At Mobile World Congress ====

Joey Sneddon of OMG! Ubuntu! reports on Android``Central’s  Phil Nickinson’s comments from one of the premier events for mobile devices, Mobile World Congress (MWC). This year it was held in Barcelona and Ubuntu for Android was strutting its stuff. Sneddon was impressed and excited to the point of “want now” but reports that “exact details remain scant on the ground as to when you can expect to get your hands on it.”

http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2012/02/ubuntu-for-android-gets-shown-off-at-world-mobile-congress/

==== Paul Wise: Debian/Ubuntu games screenshot party results ====

The Debian/Ubuntu games team recently organised a half-day screenshots party for creating screenshots for all the games that are available in Debian/Ubuntu. “Over the 7 hours of the party, they uploaded 100 screenshots for 40 different packages. Of the packages, 2 are available only in Debian (auralquiz, cutechess), one is available only in Ubuntu (plasma-widget-tictactoe) and the rest are available in both. “I think we got quite a bit done for such a small group.”

==== Powerful 'Cotton Candy' Linux PC goes on sale ====

John E Dunn of Tech``World writes about 'Cotton Candy' a powerful tiny computer that can run either Ubuntu or Android 4.0. "The $199 (APS139) computer's small size - it is enclosed within a USB stick case - belies its power. Underneath lies a custom design comprising a 1.2 GHz dual-core ARM Cortex A9 processor with 1GB or RAM, supporting for up to 64GB of microSD storage." Dunn goes on to say, "Despite being commercial, Cotton Candy is not a huge distance away from the philosophy of the UK's Raspberry Pi project."
