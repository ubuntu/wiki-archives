==== Find new ways ====

Torsten Franz writes about the Ubuntu Community Council's need to look at the Local Community (Lo``Co) project. After a brief history, we are quickly led to the need and creation of the Local Communities Research Committee (LCRC). All Ubuntu members who are interested in contributing to this are encouraged to express that interest by applying via email.

==== Phased updates in APT in 21.04 ====

Julian Andres Klode tells us that apt now has phased updates starting with Apt 2.1.16. With some brief details of implementation, we are given details on how to control these phased updates, which includes tools like aptitude or packagekit that use the APT library. Some special notes are mentioned, which include restrictions that avoid breakage, which will likely change in the future.

He mentions a discussion with Alan Pope, about an app idea, that very quickly became an app available for any who want it, and how this shows why he loves open source. Stuart then moves to problems in the open source community, especially those he would like to change. before ending with a thanks to OpenUK.

Alan Pope writes about some of his memorable examples of bugs discovered in his testing software over the years. Through "holding down keys, clicking on the wrong things, and naming things stupidly", Alan is contributing so we all have better software products.

=== Other Community News ===

==== Announcing the Ubuntu Metrics project, and calling for collaborators ====

Iain Lane tells us about a new project that is now ready for new collaborators. With links so we can see the end results and the code that makes it work, we are told it uses Grafana and InfluxDB to track metrics about work done. It can still be developed a lot more, thus Iain seeks additional Ubuntu Developers to help with the burden of development, and review (at least initially), so get in touch (especially if you're a "Grafana wizard"). Iain ends with a thanks to Canonical IS.
