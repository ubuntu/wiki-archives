Kate Stewart of the Ubuntu Release Team has announced the second, and final, beta release of Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (Long-Term Support) Desktop, Server, Cloud, and Core products, along with the recognized flavors. 

"Code-named "Precise Pangolin", 12.04 continues Ubuntu's proud tradition of integrating the latest and greatest open source technologies into a high-quality, easy-to-use Linux distribution.  The team has been hard at work through this cycle, introducing a few new features, but mostly fixing bugs.

With Ubuntu 12.04,  Kubuntu, Edubuntu, Xubuntu, Lubuntu, Mythbuntu and  Ubuntu Studio also reached Beta 2 status today.”

=== LoCo News ===

==== Stellenbosch ubuntu hour March ====

Maia Grotepass shares a photo from the latest Ubuntu Hour in Stellenbosch, South Africa.

=== Launchpad News ===

==== Parallelising the Unparallelisable ====

Having to run more than twenty thousand tests can really burden down systems - and making them work parallel brings in complications. Access to databases, temporary directories and virtual machines comes with a high overhead.  Launchpad has found their solution, LXC (Linux Containers) and talks about it in this post.

http://blog.launchpad.net/general/parallelising-the-unparallelisable

==== That Juju that you do (Part I: Bring the pain) ====

Launchpad recently announced that they were planning on changing their testing system to a parallel system but with this came a lot of unknowns and some tricky problems.  One problem was solved by using Amazon EC2 instances, while not being sure what the best architecture would be.  Then they had to set it all up quickly to overcome geographical and time zone differences, something which requires a better solution than simple shell-scripts. This post details these problems and ends with a “to be continued” with a better solution.

=== The Planet ===

==== Jono Bacon: Integrating Your App Into Unity ====

Jono Bacon shares a video about how you can integrate your application into the Unity interface, including use of Quicklists, Indicators, Launcher, Menus and the HUD and Lenses and Scopes within the Dash.

http://www.jonobacon.org/?p=4250

==== Brian Murray: See the heat ====

Brian Murray blogs about how bug heat is a good indication of which bugs need to be addressed, and takes the opportunity to graph the five hottest bugs for the packages that his team subscribes to.

http://www.murraytwins.com/blog/?p=114

==== Mark Shuttleworth: Holistic UI is smarter UX ====

Mark Shuttleworth writes about the shortcomings of having many tools that each “do one thing well,” and notes that having greater awareness between the various pieces of software would allow for better user experiences. He spotlights some small issues with the notification system, and how fixing the simple things leads to a better experience overall.

http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/1085

==== Canonical: Ubuntu Survey Parts 3 and 4 ====

The final sets of responses from the Ubuntu Survery have been released, and bring with them a closer look at the people that use Ubuntu. Some of the results include the fact that ~40% of users take advantage of Ubuntu One, users seem to be most excited about the upcoming Ubuntu for Android, and the majority of users still use Windows or other operating systems on a regular basis. Most users report that they use Ubuntu on their main PC, and are willing to buy a device with Ubuntu pre-installed.

==== Rick Spencer: 12.04 Quality Engineering Retrospective ====

Rick Spencer discusses the robustness of the upcoming 12.04 release, pointing out that he has been using the development release for a couple months and that it’s “beautiful, fast, and robust” and has “stayed of usable quality throughout the development cycle.” He goes into depth by describing the three key activities:

1. Verify and fix before landing major changes in Ubuntu
2. Not waiting when something breaks to take action
3. Test for testability, then test rigorously

And how their value led to the engineering quality Spencer observes in this development cycle.

==== Xubuntu: Beta 2 released & new branding ====

Along with their Beta2 release this week, the Xubuntu team announces a new, wider wallpaper and an update to their branding, included in 12.04.

http://xubuntu.org/news/beta-2-released-new-branding/

==== Michael Hall: Hello Unity ====

Michael Hall and David Planella have been working on a “Hello World” example application for Unity, called Hello Unity. The post provides a video explaining the key features and a link to the package and source code on Launchpad.net.

http://mhall119.com/2012/03/hello-unity/

=== In The Press ===

==== What Ubuntu users think about Ubuntu 2012 ====

“Ubuntu’s come a long way from being the popular Debian-based Linux distribution for desktops. So, who uses Ubuntu today and what do they think about where Ubuntu is now and where it’s going?” Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols of ZDNet seeks to answer this by reviewing some of the results from the Ubuntu Survey results recently published by Canonical.

http://www.zdnet.com/blog/open-source/what-ubuntu-users-think-about-ubuntu-2012/10680

=== In The Blogosphere ===

==== [How To] Easily Skin Ubuntu’s Unity Desktop ====

Joey Sneddon of OMG! Ubuntu! shares a how-to about creating custom skins for the Unity Desktop. He shows how to create a “Costume Background,” and how to use My``Unity to put it into good use.

http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2012/03/how-to-easily-skin-ubuntus-unity-desktop/

==== Canonical Integrates Landscape with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS ====

Manuel Jose shares that Ubuntu 12.04 now contains Landscape, a service from Canonical that allows administrators to “monitor, manage and update [their] entire Ubuntu infrastructure from a single interface” and provides management tools that help admins remotely access machines, manage tasks, and get real-time alerts. Jose shows screenshots of how this integration works in 12.04.

http://www.techdrivein.com/2012/03/canonical-integrates-landscape-with.html

==== Red Hat Earnings End Ubuntu Server Debate ====

The VAR Guy takes a look at the announced quarterly results from Red Hat in context of the recently made blog post by Ubuntu founder Mark Shuttleworth about the success of Ubuntu at Red Hat’s expense.

http://www.thevarguy.com/2012/03/29/red-hat-earnings-put-ubuntu-server-debate-to-rest/

==== On Old Hardware, Think Twice About Ubuntu 12.04 ====

With less than a month to go before Ubuntu 12.04 LTS is released Phoronix has already done a host of tests using the pre-release images and are planning even more once the final release is out. So far for all of the improvements in Precise Pangolin in regards to performance and power usage for “respectable hardware, Ubuntu 12.04 LTS is looking great”, but the verdict on older hardware is slightly less rosy.  

http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTA3ODQ

==== If You're Lucky, Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Can Boot Faster ====

Thus far the booting time tests conducted by Phoronix have been a mixed bag with boot times sometimes being faster and even, at times, being twice as slow as booting Ubuntu 10.04.

http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=ubuntu_1204_boots&num=1

==== Ubuntu 12.04 vs. Windows 8: The Battle for Desktop Supremacy ====

A unified interface is one which is to be used over multiple different devices. Unity is one, Windows 8 is another. Jun Auza does a little comparing to see how they match up.

http://www.junauza.com/2012/03/ubuntu-1204-vs-windows-8-battle-for.html
