==== Ubuntu 20.04.2.0 hotfix released ====

Łukasz 'sil2100' Zemczak outlines a regression discovered shortly after the release of Ubuntu 20.04.2 which left installs without a kernel; thus unable to boot. This caused the release team to re-issue images of 20.04.2 with a corrected installer. We are told this includes most flavors, with links provided for downloads.

==== Ubuntu Backports a Major App Update to Ubuntu 20.04 LTS ====

Joey Sneddon tells us that Thunderbird 68 is no longer supported upstream, thus, because it's more work to backport all security fixes to it, the Ubuntu developers have opted to replace it with Thunderbird 78, quoting Canonical's Oliver Tilloy. Joey notes the Ubuntu warning that this may cause disruption for some users due to changes outlined in the post.

==== The Work Ahead For Ubuntu 21.04 To Switch To Wayland By Default ====

Michael Larabel reminds us that "Ubuntu 21.04 is aiming to use Wayland by default for non-NVIDIA systems" though more work is yet to be done. Ubuntu developers have made their 'workboard' public allowing us all to get a great view of this work. Michael walks us through many of the items on that workboard. Supporting links to "Wayland-by-default" are provided, as well as for the Trello workboard.
