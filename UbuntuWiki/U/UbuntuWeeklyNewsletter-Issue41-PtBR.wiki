The Community Council met to discuss agenda freezes, the Ubuntu Media Center, and approval of new members and Lo``Co teams. It was decided that the agenda will be frozen one day before meetings for general items and just before the meetings for Lo``Co teams and member candidates. The Ubuntu Media Center Team was approved and is responsible for creating software that will be installable on any Ubuntu based system and provide multimedia facilities like out-of-the-box support for remote controls, TV watching (including PVR capabilities), video/music on deman, X10 home control technology, and many other features. Read more at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuMediaCenterTeam.

==== Novo Time de Torrent ====
Andrea Veri has announced the creation of the MOTU torrent team, and they need your help! The torrent team will take care of and develop packages related to the Bit``Torrent peer-to-peer protocol, while working closely with upstream. It’s also the bug report contact for all torrent packages in Launchpad. They are currently interested in universe and main sponsorship and are looking for more packagers too, so if you are someone who is interested, ping Andrea Veri (bluekuja) on #ubuntu-motu-torrent on irc.freenode.net, or just apply to join the team in launchpad. As is the custom across Ubuntu you can keep an eye on them via their wiki page. Launchpad: https://launchpad.net/~motu-torrent Wiki: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MOTU/Teams/Torrent

==== Ubu(un)con-Boulder ====
Ubucon-Boulder is a free, all-day gathering of Ubuntu-related demos, talks, chats, to show each other what *buntu can do, and Google’s Boulder office is where all the proposed action is. Jim Mc``Master, a developer at Google and Leslie Hawthorn, of Google’s Open Source Program Office in California are the gracious hosts for the venue of this unconference-like Barcamp. Due to space constraints, it will be a small gathering of around 20 people, and registration is first-come, first-served. Read more at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Ubucon-Boulder

==== Novo Endereço para Submissão de Histórias ====
The Marketing Team has created a new mailing list you can submit any idea or story relevant to any of the Marketing Team projects (UWN, Full Circle, The Fridge, etc). Send us your scoops to: ubuntu-marketing-submissions@lists.ubuntu.com

==== Notícias do Conselho do Fórum ====
The Forum Council met to discuss username changes, how to deal with problem staff members, staff renewals, and staff selections:
* Usernames will not be changed unless there are extenuating circumstances. Make the case to an admin, and they can decide whether or not to change it.
* Forum staff problems will be dealt directly with the problem staff member. If agreement cannot be reached, it will be dealt with in a public meeting.
* Staff renewals will be done with a simple private message on the forums.
* Staff selections will be continue to be by word of mouth.

==== Projeto "Ubuntu Mobile and Embedded" a Caminho ====
Matt Zimmerman has announced more details about the Ubuntu Mobile and Embedded project (UME). The purpose of UME is "to build a complete mobile OS based on Ubuntu, with all of the necessary components integrated into the Ubuntu package archive, ready to install and run, or to tailor for custom mobile applications." A mailing list has been created, along with the beginnings of some technical specifications and code.

=== Na Imprensa ===

* Alison Hunt, at Motley Fool, says that for most people who just use their computers for email, surfing the web, and photo management, a fast machine with Windows Vista is not necessary. There are free alternatives to Windows like Ubuntu and installing it is painless. Since Ubuntu comes with Evolution, Firefox, Open Office, F-Spot, and Rhythmbox, the user is ready to go. Alison likes that Ubuntu promises to remain free and will not charge for upgrades. Read the full article: http://www.fool.co.uk/news/money-saving-tips/household-bills/2007/05/15/kit-out-a-pc-for-free!.aspx

* James Bannan, at APC Magazine, provides a tutorial on how to install Ubuntu and dual boot with Windows XP. James provides screenshots as he walks through loading the Live CD and running the installer to set the default language, time zone, keyboard layout, and user account. He continues with partitioning the disk and modifying GRUB to change the default operating system and boot menu timeout. James calls GRUB "an excellent and highly flexible bootloader." Read the full article at: http://apcmag.com/6101/dualboot_windows_xp_and_ubuntu

* Brian Provost, at IT Security, discusses way to secure a default installation of Ubuntu. He suggests disabling ssh root login, limiting access to "su," and enabling automatic security updates. Antivirus software is recommended to protect inbound and outbound files transmitted from other Windows computers. Firewalls should be used to keep attackers away and various network tools allow for monitoring and securing networks. Read more: http://www.itsecurity.com/features/ubuntu-secure-install-resource/

* The BBC has a programme covering Ubuntu and Mark Shuttleworth. Mark discusses how Ubuntu makes Linux more accessible by focusing on everday user experiences like working better on laptops, extending battery life, and providing improved wireless networking. Ubuntu's partnership with Intel is mentioned along with a test-drive of the Freedom Toaster, a kiosk which will burn different pieces of open source software onto a CD. Details of the programme can be found at http://www.bbcworld.com/Pages/ProgrammeFeature.aspx?id=18&FeatureID=201.

=== Na Blogosfera ===

* Adrian Kingsley-Hughes, at ZDNet, discusses the process of installing LAMP on Linux. After researching for the easiest way to make this happen, Adrian decides to down and install Ubuntu 7.04. Adrian uses the server ISO and uses the text installer. He considers the lack of graphics during the installation refreshing compared to Windows. The installation routine was relatively easy and Adrian is surprised since he expected to do lots of command-line work. Read more: http://blogs.zdnet.com/hardware/?p=406

* Sal Cangeloso, at XYZ Computing, wonders if Dell is good for Ubuntu. Without Wine or any virtualization software set up by default, some Windows users may shy away if certain Windows specific products do not work on Ubuntu. Special attention must be paid to the impact on smaller system builders like System76, who will have a tough time competing with Dell's prices. Still, with all the uncertainties of the Dell/Ubuntu partnership, Canonical will want to make sure Dell's support for Ubuntu doesn't reflect badly on them and Sal believes "the fact that it was made is a great sign for the future, especially for the ever-expanding legions of Ubuntu fans."

* "Only Ubuntu Linux" shows how to install a LAMP server using Ubuntu 7.04. Screenshots of the install process are provided along with instructions on how to set up a ssh server and configuring a static IP address for the server. Read more: http://onlyubuntu.blogspot.com/2007/05/ubuntu-704-feisty-fawn-lamp-server.html

* Alphonse Leong, at PerformancePC, describe Ubuntu Studio as "an ambitious attempt to bring Linux multimedia creation to the mainstream, and the results are surprisingly good." Alphonse provides a quick synopsis of the various graphics and audio tools availabe on Ubuntu and thinks the interface is inviting and the simple installation makes the user productive quickly.

* Gary shows how to install and set up MythTV on Ubuntu. He shows how to test if a digital video broadcasting cards will work with the kernel and how to test the output using mplayer and gxine. Gary continues with instructions to install the MythTV software and testing the configuration. Read more at http://parker1.co.uk/mythtv_ubuntu.php
