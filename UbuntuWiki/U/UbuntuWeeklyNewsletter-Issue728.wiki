This Discourse thread annotates the difficulties of maintaining extensions, opening a discussion amongst the relevant Community Boards to what sublist Ubuntu will maintain.

==== Ubuntu 22.04 LTS with Nvidia 510: Wayland session also for GeForce under Gnome 42 ====

Theodore Meeks alerts us that in the Ubuntu 22.04 release Nvidia now also supports the Wayland session for those utilizing the Nvidia 510 driver or higher.

Additionally he highlights the hardware enablement stack roadmap and touches on GTK 4 apps availability.
