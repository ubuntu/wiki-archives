====== Pennsylvania ======
We had a total of 9 people show up for our 6 hour Jam, a couple of whom were new and one who came out from New Jersey to join in. Cake, pizza and soda were the draw, but it was the nourishment of some delicious fruit that a co-worker of Art's (who showed up for the day to help out, being interested in our work) brought kept some of us from keeling over from too much junk food, she was a life-saver!

* <nowiki>[[http://blog.grossmeier.net/2008/08/11/last-post-about-the-gbj/|Michigan Team Report 2]]</nowiki>
* We had two of our members working remotely; one in California, and one arriving at DebConf 2008. this really made it a Global Bug Jam for our team.
* There was a bug relating to networked Frozen Bubble crashing. We tried briefly to get Frozen Bubble networked, but didn't get it working (possibly an issue with the network we were using).
* As appears to be tradition with Bug Jams at the library, a thunderstorm was brewing outside.
* 54 bugs improved!
====== California ======
* We had about 20 people show up, all excited to work on Ubuntu. We might've gotten about 10-15 bugs taken care of, but everyone was helping out one way or another.
* <nowiki>[[http://nhaines.livejournal.com/51418.html|Nathan Haines]]</nowiki> blogged about it on the Ubuntu Planet.
* Some <nowiki>[[http://flickr.com/photos/yasumoto/sets/72157606727662156/|pictures]]</nowiki> from the event.
