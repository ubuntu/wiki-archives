==== BQ goes global with Ubuntu ====

Jordana Sherman announces the opening of BQ's global store where anyone can now buy an Aquaris Ubuntu edition handset. Jordana writes: "We know (and BQ has acknowledged) that network frequency, and mobile operator, compatibility in some countries, such as the US, will limit some of the handset and OS functionality that European users are presently enjoying." She continues by saying that Canonical stand committed to bringing the best Ubuntu phone to individual regions around the world.
