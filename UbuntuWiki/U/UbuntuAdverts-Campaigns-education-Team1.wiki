Ideas

Idea 1: dare to be different, hidden passion, set your PC free

Imagery to set to mood http://thundafunda.com/33/animals-pictures-nature/dare-to-be-different-pictures.php

The idea is to encourage people to try Ubuntu and not be afraid of it being different. 

By celebrating difference we make it an advantage not a disadvantage.

If using a person who is different, that person should be subtly doing something. i.e. using a laptop, tablet 

i.e. a row of smarty dressed businesswomen. One punk. But the punk is on her tablet.

Medium 

Primarily thinking of print media or web banners, but if a budget is made available could also be made into a TV or Radio spot.

Idea 2: a game
