==== The Open Source Community Responds to Dave Neary's GNOME Census Work Presentation at GUADEC ====

Dave Neary presented his GNOME Census work [1] at GUADEC on July 28th, 2010. Response to this presentation set ablaze the internet.

Greg De``Koenigsberg (former Red Hat Employee) blogged [2] in anger his reponse to seeing the census numbers presented by Neary at GUADEC. His response was about how Canonical doesn't contribute enough upstream to the GNOME project.

In response Jono Bacon, Ubuntu Community Manager blogged [3] to refute the claims that Greg De``Koenigsberg's made on his blog post. In the comments section of Jono's post you can find Dylan Mc``Call's "sensible" comment [4] which Mark Shuttleworth refers later in his post.

Around this same time a rather "pithy" blog post [5] was posted by Jeffery Stedfast.

Mark Shuttleworth also weighed in and blogged in response to all the posts and accusations flying around the internet with his  "Tribalism is the enemny within" post [6] in which he cites both Greg, Jono and Dylan's posts.

Then on Sunday August 1st, 2010, Greg De``Koenigsberg apologized for the earlier post he posted in anger in his  "Old Wounds" blog post [7].

==== Ubuntu Global Jam: Start Your Engines! ====
<nowiki>[[File:3978188796_bd3d7d762a_b.jpg | width=325|height=300]]</nowiki>
Are you good folks aware of what is happening on 27th – 29th August 2010. But of course, it is the Ubuntu Global Jam!

In the last few cycles we have organized and run an event called the Ubuntu Global Jam.

The idea was simple: encourage our awesome global Ubuntu community to get together in the same room to work on bugs, translations, documentation, testing and more. And they did, all over the world, as can be seen here.

To make the event as simple and accessible as possible, we have picked five topic areas and we are encouraging you lovely people to organize an event with one or more of them:

* Bugs – finding, triaging and fixing bugs.
* Testing – testing the new release and reporting your feedback.
* Upgrade – upgrading to Maverick from Lucid and reporting your upgrade experience.
* Documentation – writing documentation about how to use Ubuntu and how to join the community.
* Translations – translating Ubuntu and helping to make it available in everyone’s local language.
* Packaging – packaging software for Ubuntu users to install with a clock.
* Other – other types of contribution such as marketing and advocacy etc.

With six primary methods of getting involved, there is something for everyone in this rocking global event.

==== Ubuntu 10.10 Alpha-3 coming next week ====

This is just a reminder that we are one week away from Ubuntu 10.10 Alpha 3, and the following week is Feature Freeze (08/12) [1]. Those wanting their features included in this release will need to upload as soon as possible. Features landing after Feature Freeze will need to be approved by the release team before being accepted [2].

==== 10.04.1 Release Schedule Update ====

The Ubuntu Release team, SRU team, and team tech leads had a meeting (July 20th, 2010) about the first lucid point release preparation.

This is the current list of targeted bugs:

https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+milestone/ubuntu-10.04.1

We'll most likely drop some more, but by and large 10.04.1 will be what is currently in -updates and -security, hopefully most of what is currently in -proposed, and a lot of what is on above milestone list.

Due to not having a full-time release manager (apologies from me on this), we need to push back the release date from the originally planned date of July 29th to August 12th.  This will give use one more week to develop bug fixes, one week to test them in -proposed, and one week to roll and vet images.

Please note that this schedule change *DOES NOT AFFECT 10.10*...we are firmly committed to delivering Maverick Meerkat on 10.10.10. ;)

==== Fixing Ubuntu Software Center Descriptions ====

The Ubuntu Software Center is making some rocking progress, but as everyone’s favorite Dr Vish suggests, it is only a container for other content, and we need to fix and improve the descriptions of apps inside Ubuntu to make it easier for users.

This is a wonderful contribution to Ubuntu. Want to get involved? Simple, check out Vish’s awesome post.

=== LoCo News ===

==== Monthly Reports ====

Monthly reports are a really good habit to get into for all of us!  But for Lo``Co Teams it’s especially good.  It will help you keep track of your events and possibly if you aren’t doing much highlight this to you as you’ll see events decreasing which isn’t a good sign of an active team.

What is a good idea is to appoint one person to do up the team report each month. Mail the team saying the report has been created and let people add any other snippets of information they may not have heard about.  This is a great way to stimulate conversation but also means it’s not just down to one person to add content.

==== LoCo Council meeting time change ====

We had a clash in #ubuntu-meeting with another meeting so we've moved the Lo``Co Council meeting by one hour.

==== Ubuntistas, the magazine of the Greek LoCo ====

It's a (almost) bi-monthly, electronic only Ubuntu and FLOSS related magazine with great success! The magazine includes interviews, tutorials and news of high quality. The magazine is organized through our forums and it's totally community generated -both content and artwork-. We magazine is active for 2 years (8 issues). The content is in Greek so unfortunately non-greek speakers cannot enjoy it.

You can find all the issues at:

==== Ubuntu Q&A community in Shapado - progress ====

A few days ago I invited you to take a look at Shapado and its Ubuntu Q&A community.

It's picking up nicely: http://ubuntu.shapado.com/

If anyone in this list wants to be an admin my only requirement is that you are a current Ubuntu member.

Most users are English and Spanish for now. The site supports 4 languages (French, Portuguese, English and Spanish) with the next release supporting many more, including Russian, Macedonian, Dutch, Galician, German and Catalan.

Progress of translation can be seen here:

http://translatewiki.net/wiki/Translating:Shapado/stats

My personal experience using it has been great and I've learned quite a bit while exploring this new way of helping other Ubuntu users. My main focus is Spanish and English. I've asked my local team members to take a look at this but I don't expect much activity before school is back :D Right now in summer most everyone I know here in Quebec is out catching some sun.

==== Ubuntu Hour in Bangalore ====

Woo! After a while, the Ubuntu Lo``Co community is awakening in Bangalore again.  I had announced a meet up on the mailing list a while back.  I had my fingers crossed as to how many would turn up and how it would be.  Most people assured me “if there are 2 people and the other person isn’t your imaginary friend, its a success!“

I’m glad to report that we ended up with 7 people coming in.  It started out a bit slow with just me sitting alone in Cafe Coffee Day on Richmond Road.  To be a little more noticeable I opened up the laptop and sat in such a way I could see everyone who walked in.  Anyone who looked lost was definitely looking for the Ubuntu Hour (note to self:  Sticker on laptop sounds like a good idea now).

==== Became members of Ubuntu Colombia ====

Ingeniero Forigua takes a moment to tell members in the Ubuntu Columbia team area how they can become members of the team.

==== Limerick Ubuntu hour a success ====

Thanks to all those who came along it was great to meet new people here in Limerick who are users of Ubuntu but also want to get more people using it.

Seven of us turned up the Absolute Hotel in Limerick, I had a table got and had a few things that were on the table to let folks know I was there.  I was really chuffed to see so many people turn up, a lot were end users like myself and others are using Ubuntu but also want to see it more visible in their workplace.

==== Second San Francisco Ubuntu Hour ====

On Tuesday I hosted the second San Francisco Ubuntu Hour. We had four people in attendance (thanks for dropping by James, Grant and Michelle!).

It ended up being quite an evening for gadgets. As is typical, I brought along my mini9 and Grant showed up with his ever popular OLPC laptop.

==== Ubuntu China LoCo Team resigning and nomination meeting ====

=== Launchpad News ===

==== Meet Benji York ====

Matthew Revell interviews Benji York, Canonical’s Launchpad team. Matthew asks Benji the following questions and more:

* What do you do on the Launchpad team?
* Can we see something that you’ve worked on?
* Where do you work?
* What did you do before working at Canonical?

==== Assigning bugs to someone else, or not ====

Recently, we changed the way assigning bugs works on Launchpad. It used to be that anyone could assign anyone else to a bug. This was open to abuse as you can imagine. Bug 511269 was filed about the potential problems with this, and we recently changed Launchpad so that only bug supervisors can assign a bug to someone else.

You can still assign a bug to yourself, but this does keep you from assigning someone to a bug to draw their attention to said bug. In the end, this is a good thing, though, as people should only be assigned bugs who are going to be responsible for working on them.

Now there is one issue with this change. Projects that had not established a bug supervisor for the project will find their developers can no longer assign bugs to each other. The easy fix for this is to create a bug supervisor team for your project and have the people working on your bugs assigned to this team. We do realize this might be a bit heavy weight for some projects, so we’ve opened bug 603281 about this issue.  A fix for this — only requiring bug supervisor permissions if bug supervisor is defined — should be appearing on Launchpad soon.

==== Robbie Williamson: My Motivation for Doing Opensource ====

Robbie Williamson, Canonical Foundations Team Manager discusses what his motivation for doing Opensource is.

Here is some of what Robbie had to say:

The reason I like working in opensource is that I believe the fundamental core of it, is to give…that’s it.  Giving feels good.  I’ve donated my time and money to various charitable organizations, and while they are all good causes…helping people who needed…deep down, I do it because it makes me feel good (and I know I’m not alone).

==== Why Ubuntu Linux Is a Good Business Choice ====

Ken Hess, PC World discusses Ubuntu as a good business choice.

One of those choices is Ubuntu Linux, a greatly enhanced Debian-based  Linux distribution that installs easily, has the familiar Windows look  and feel, and operates well on older hardware (expensive upgrade not  required). Linux fans tout the positive attributes, often at high  decibel levels, of Ubuntu Linux, which is perhaps the world's most popular Linux distribution. But, is it business worthy?

==== Ubuntu's two big advantages over Windows and Mac ====

Jason Hiner with zdnet gives discusses two significant advantages that Ubuntu has over Windows 7 and Mac OS X. This came up last week because Apple displaced Oracle as the new world leader in  security vulnerabilities, according to a report from Secunia.
 1. Comprehensive software updates
 2. Integrated app store

==== Get a Blazing-Fast Computer for Free ====

Farhad Manjoo discusses how Ubuntu can be used on older hardware - Well, I think they've done it. I made a second foray onto Ubuntu's  shores a week ago, and so far, I like it quite a bit. The OS has  progressed a great deal since I last checked in (in 2008 I installed  version 8.04; now I'm running version 10.04). I found Ubuntu quick to  install, speedy to do pretty much everything, and, thankfully, very easy  to figure out. There were some rough edges; for instance, Ubuntu's  designers ought to make some of its error messages more comprehensible  to newbies. While installing Skype, I was informed that a "later version  is available in a software channel. You are strongly advised to install  the version from the software channel, since it is usually better  supported." I'm pretty sure that could have been translated to, "Click  'Next' to install a newer version of Skype." For the most part, though,  Ubuntu has broken free of technical mumbo jumbo, and if you've got a  little bit of tech savvy, you'll have no problem dealing with it.

So Ubuntu is good. But why should you use it?

Farhad Manjoo continues with - "To me, it's the perfect way to give an aging Windows PC new life."

==== Canonical fluffs one-click Ubuntu cloud stack ====

Gaven Clark with the Register reports -  Canonical has revealed  that it's working with open-source project Hadoop and NoSQL database  providers to deepen the level of integration between these big-data  technologies and the Linux distro's next planned release: Maverick  Meerkat, aka Ubuntu 10.10, due in October.

Separately, sources close to Canonical have told The Reg that the company is in talks with Cassandra and CouchDB on NoSQL, and  start-up Puppet``Labs for data-center automation and provisioning.

Canonical also has an internal project underway codenamed Ensemble to  manage dependencies, deployment, and provisioning of applications on  Ubuntu clouds.
Data center and application tooling will come in the follow-on Ubuntu 11.04 and 11.10 releases.

Canonical's end goal seems to be single-click deployment for a cloud  from the Ubuntu command line, starting with specific applications.

==== GNOME 3 not ready yet, release pushed back to 2011 ====

Ryan Paul with Ars Technical discusses delay in release for GNOME 3 - The developers behind the GNOME project have gathered in the Netherlands this week for the annual GUADEC conference.  During a meeting that took place at the event, the GNOME release team  made the difficult decision to delay the launch of GNOME 3, the next  major version of the popular open source desktop environment.

The new version has been deemed unready for mass consumption and will  need another round of refinements before it can achieve the level of  maturity and robustness that is expected by the software's users.  Although the news will likely disappoint some enthusiasts, it is  consistent with the GNOME development community's conservative approach  to release management and strong emphasis on predictability.

==== Using ALSA to Control Linux Audio ====

Carla Shroder discusses Using ALSA -  Last week I wrote how to configure Pulse``Audio on Ubuntu  so you could easily stop and start it when you wanted to, instead of  being stuck with it being on all the time, or having to remove it just  to get it out of your way. Today I'm going to show how to use ALSA,  which has been the default Linux audio subsystem for many years. ALSA  has its limitations, but it's perfectly fine for controlling both  playback and recording volume.

==== Try Out Opera Mini In Ubuntu ====

Anurag Upadhaya discusses how to run Opera Mini in Ubuntu - You must have seen plenty of ways to run Opera Mini in Windows  XP or Windows 7 (yes, we are not talking about mobiles here). Want to  experience the same thing on Ubuntu? The process to run it on Windows  and Ubuntu is almost same with the same software application required for emulation, but still we will take you through the required steps.

==== Ubuntu Server makes gains at SUSE Linux' expense ====

Bridget Botelho, Senior News Writer,Search``Enterprise``Linux.com, discusses the how Ubuntu Server is filling the gaps in the enterprise market.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux is still the most widely used open source server operating system in data centers, but Ubuntu Server adoption is on the rise, and it could come at the expense of SUSE Linux.

That said, Canonical Ltd.’s Ubuntu Server market share is quite small compared with Windows Server and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), but the gap between SUSE and Ubuntu has shrunk over the past year, with Ubuntu deployments rising slightly and SUSE declining, according to Tech``Target’s Data Center Decisions 2010 survey.

According to the survey of 1,049 IT managers, the most commonly used data center OSes are Windows Server 2003 (81%), Windows Server 2008 (52%) and 2008 R2 (45%), followed by RHEL (41%). SUSE Linux ranks below Sun Solaris, IBM AIX, HP-UX and iOS at 16%, while 14% of respondents said they use Ubuntu Linux.

==== Whitelisting Advances with New Bouncer App ====

Sean Michael Kerner informs people that starting with Bouncer 6.0, the company is moving to a software appliance model powered by Ubuntu Linux.

Security  vendor Core``Trace is updating its Bouncer whitelisting application this  week, providing new insight and control into securing applications for  enterprise use. The basic concept behind whitelisting is to only enable  approved applications and deny access to those that aren't.

With the proliferation of applications and the growing strains on  enterprise IT, it's not always possible to have all the necessary  applications on a whitelist. That's where Core``Trace's new Bouncer 6.0  release is aiming to help.

Bouncer 6.0 includes a new cloud-based intelligence service that  is being integrated to help administrators stay up-to-date on current  application security risks and patches. The new Bouncer release will  also help to enable enterprise compliance with software licensing by  providing visibility into application usage.

Overall, what Core``Trace is aiming to do with its new release is  help broaden the definition of what whitelisting applications are able  to do as enterprises continue to secure their application usage.

==== Dell to Continue to Sell Ubuntu Systems, Just Not on Its UK Website ====

By Lucian Parfeni, Web News Editor for Spoftpedia, dispells the myth that Dell isn't shipping laptops with Ubuntu pre-installed on them.

... while 'Dell no longer sells  Ubuntu laptops' makes for a great headline, it’s not exactly true. In  fact, Dell is expanding its offering with the first desktop system  available for quite a while and has started shipping systems with Ubuntu  10.04. However, it has stopped selling Ubuntu machines in its UK online  shop.

...Dell is still selling them over  the phone. But they’re gone from the website and there doesn’t seem to  be any plans to bring them back any time soon...

There are some good news coming from Dell though, the company has recently expanded its Ubuntu offering. It has now started selling its Studio XPS 7100 desktop  pre-installed with Ubuntu, a more powerful machine than the Inspiron line it offered before. It also marks the first time Dell has offered  Ubuntu 10.04 out of the box. Other systems come with Ubuntu 9.10 and  even Ubuntu 9.04. Seeing as any of them can be easily upgraded to the  latest version, it’s not much of an inconvenience for users. In conclusion, Dell is not dropping Ubuntu, at least not in the foreseeable future, but a clearer and more focused strategy from the OEM giant  would be nice.

Ubuntu Forums Council - July 2010

 1. LTSP Forums (suggestion) (http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1513563) - For now we prefer if the Server Platform (http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=339) section is used with a tag - '''''LTSP'''''. If / when traffic increases we can re-consider a subforum, but the impression is the traffic is low.

===== Quebec Team =====

''' Ubuntu Quebec team report for January-July 2010 '''

This is the first Ubuntu QC team report in quite some time. It highlights the past few months activities. June, July and August are typically slower months as Summer kicks in and everyone is out trying to get some sun but the Ubuntu QC community has been anything but dormant.

''The Ubuntu Hour, held in February (http://www.fabianrodriguez.com/blog/2010/02/10/reminder-ubuntu-hour-this-thursday-feb-11th-in-montreal/)'' (Montreal Geek``Fest (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/attachment:IMG_0448.jpg)) <<BR>>

''http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/view?uname=magicfab&isOwner=true&tags=Geekfest#), held in March'' (here's one in February (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/attachment:IMG_1510.jpg))

Here are highlights of recent activity:

* In July, Fabian``Rodriguez invited the locoteams and general Ubuntu community to start using Shapado.com for their language-specific Q&A

* Also in July, Fabian``Rodriguez proposed and got confirmation to offer an introductory informal course about free software and Linux at a local library (Mile End library, on Park Ave, Montreal. The goal is to experiment a new formula in creating local communities in neighborhoods near the library. Ubuntu books have been donated previously to this library.

* A number of Ubuntu Hour events were held ((http://www.fabianrodriguez.com/blog/2010/02/10/reminder-ubuntu-hour-this-thursday-feb-11th-in-montreal/)), with low but great attendance. Ubuntu users from abroad know this event and actually plan their time in Montreal to meet us :) Employees from the nearby Canonical office would bring hardware and Ubuntu gadgets to share impressions on.

* In June the highlight was a victory in court for Savoir Faire Linux (a local company, also a Canonical training partner) who questioned the local government contracting methods which favored Microsoft. Many Ubuntu QC members followed this and participated in the effort. Details at:

** http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2010/06/03/quebec-microsoft-lawsuit.html

** http://slashdot.org/submission/1252548/Free-software-wins-court-battle

* In May a great event took place at a local IT school, Sup``Info (http://www.supinfo.com/en/News0eaaf665-d9bf-4563-befb-ac97f8b035c2.aspx). Their students had attended the Global Jam which we organized previously and organized this by themselves with out assistance. FabianRodriguez presented there.
