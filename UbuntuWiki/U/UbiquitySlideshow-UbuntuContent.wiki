__TOC__

The Ubiquity Slideshow for Ubuntu is being <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/ubiquity-slideshow-ubuntu|worked on over at Launchpad]]</nowiki>. The infrastructure and design is now reasonably solid, so it is time to commit ourselves to some good content.

This Wiki page is where proposals for written content can be added so we can decide upon one.

Each slide is 700x420 pixels. At present, the stuff that changes with each slide is: a large icon for decoration and context, a title and a large block of body text. That stuff is what we will be working on here. During this phase, slides can be added or removed freely; the content is completely flexible.

== Content Proposals ==

Please add proposals for content here. New proposals can be created as sub pages of this one, and will automatically be linked to. Feel free to add some extra notes and comments about the proposals in this page.
