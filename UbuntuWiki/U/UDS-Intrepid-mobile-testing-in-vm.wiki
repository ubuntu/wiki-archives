=== Virtualization ===

Due to the lack of MID devices in the public marketplace, it is important that we have a facility for community member to test UME releases. Xephyr (the current technology being used) is not a valid option for many reasons, therefore a new method is required.

Virtual machines offer an isolated environment separate from the influence of the host system. This is considered the best option for testing, next to an actual device.

Some changes need to be made to the UME releases for them to support VM. This topic is proposed as a means of identifying the work that must be done for that support to be added, and the resources assigned. 

=== Sub Topics ===

'''Topics to be covered within the Virtualization discussion:'''
* Discussion of changes required to support VM
* Dicussion of resources required to make the necessary changes
* Discussion of timelines for VM support
* Discussion of roadblocks preventing the proposed changes and timelines
