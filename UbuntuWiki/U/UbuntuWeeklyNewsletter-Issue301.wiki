==== Ubuntu considers “huge” change that would end traditional release cycle ====

Jon Brodkin of Ars Technica reports that Canonical is considering switching from the traditional release cycle to a rolling release, where a major version is released every two years, with updates rolled out in between. Reasons for the switch include being able to stay current with security updates and software fixes, as well as giving developers more time and fewer restrictions to deliver features.

http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/01/ubuntu-considers-huge-change-that-would-end-traditional-release-cycle/

==== Ubuntu CEO: two-year releases are only “an idea” ====
