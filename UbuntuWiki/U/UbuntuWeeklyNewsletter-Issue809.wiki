==== Ubuntu Desktop 23.10 release image is being updated to resolve a malicious translation incident ====

Oliver Smith alerts us to a problem with a translation used by the ubuntu-desktop-installer, leading to the removal of Ubuntu 23.10 ISOs using that installer. We're given some details of the issue, and that it did not impact installed/upgraded systems; then we are told what will occur in the coming days with the production & testing of new ISOs. This post has been, and will remain updated as new details emerge.

Update: Oct 16, 2023 at 18:26 BST.

"...following an audit of all desktop installer translations, Ubuntu Desktop 23.10 is available for download from https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop.
Updated builds for Ubuntu Budgie 23.10 and Ubuntu Desktop 23.10 Lenovo X13s Gen1 are also available."
