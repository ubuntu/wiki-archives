* '''TOPIC''': The Ubuntu spirit: sharing Ubuntu with people who need it
* '''LEADER''': `dholbach`(?)
* '''SESSIONS REQUIRED''': 1
* '''DESCRIPTION''': We all take the Ubuntu spirit seriously, so let's think about how we could share it with people who are on the other side of the "digital divide". (Which NGOs are working with it already? Is there anything we can do to make things better? Jono <nowiki>[[http://www.jonobacon.org/2009/01/06/open-source-and-open-learning/|wrote about it too]]</nowiki>).
<<BR>>

<<BR>>
* '''TOPIC''': Unshackling Open Week
* '''LEADER''': `jcastro`
* '''SESSIONS REQUIRED''': 1

=== Development related ===
* '''TOPIC''': Finding Development tasks
* '''LEADER''': `dholbach`
* '''SESSIONS REQUIRED''': 1

<<BR>>
* '''TOPIC''': Improving Rosetta
* '''LEADER''': DavidPlanella
* '''SESSIONS REQUIRED''': 1
* '''DESCRIPTION''': We use Rosetta as the tool for translating Ubuntu. As functional as it is, there is always room for improvement. We can talk about specific improvements here.
<<BR>>
* '''TOPIC''': Improving Kubuntu translations
* '''LEADER''': DavidPlanella
* '''SESSIONS REQUIRED''': 1
* '''DESCRIPTION''': Kubuntu translations need some love. Especially in the last releases they were far from perfect. I'd like to talk of ways in which we can improve this with those involved in Kubuntu and in translations in general.

=== Roundtables ===

Generic things we usually discuss or should be brought up:
 
* '''Contributor Burnout''' - the per-cycle health check of our family. 
* '''Contributor Boredom''' - some of the "old timers" might be getting bored with things in the community, how do we spice things up?
* '''Making Better Horsemen''' - don't think this needs it's own session this time, but we (Jono, Daniel, Jorge, David) are always looking for feedback and places to improve our interactions with the community.
* etc.
