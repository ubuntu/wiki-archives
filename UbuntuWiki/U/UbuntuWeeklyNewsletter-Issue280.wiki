==== Ubuntu Server Plans to Move Away From 32-Bit Computing ====

==== Coverflow Returns to Unity in Ubuntu 12.10 ====

Joey Sneddon of OMG! Ubuntu! writes that "coverflow" views, which was due to ship as part of Ubuntu 12.04, has been added to Unity‘s development branch for Ubuntu 12.10. Sneddon explains that this view allows one to browse items by dragging them horizontally with the mouse, rather than the usual ‘drop down, vertical’ approach currently used in Unity.

==== Gnome Online Accounts To Ship By Default In Ubuntu 12.10 ====

==== Ubuntu 12.10 Will Ship With Older Version of Nautilus ====

Joey Sneddon of OMG! Ubuntu! reports that the latest Nautilus 3.5.x will not include the popular type-ahead and split-pane views. These changes, as well as a streamlined UI redesign, required Ubuntu to stick with an older, but more feature rich version of Nautilus for Ubuntu 12.10. The newer version of Nautilus will be available in the repositories.
