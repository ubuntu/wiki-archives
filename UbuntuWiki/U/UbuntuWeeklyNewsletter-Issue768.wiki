==== Announcing Edubuntu Revival ====

Erich Eickmeyer announces the revival of Edubuntu. We are reminded what Edubuntu's intended audience was, and how Erich and family were at Ubuntu Summit in November 2022. We are introduced to Erich's wife Amy who is involved with Early Childhood education, and how this led to the start of Edubuntu's revival. Amy will be flavor lead, with Erich the technical lead. We are told how we can install it on Ubuntu lunar (23.04), and given a list of differences with this and the past Edubuntu. We are reminded this is still only in the starting stages, thus much could change.
