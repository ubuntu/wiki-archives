== What is UbuntuKylin ? ==

The objective of the UbuntuKylin project is to create a variant of Ubuntu that is more suitable for Chinese users. We are committed to provide you with a delicate, thoughtful and fully customized Chinese user experience out-of-the-box. For instance, by providing a desktop user interface localized in Chinese and installing common software that Chinese users commonly use by default. UbuntuKylin has been a formal member of the Ubuntu family, since UbuntuKylin 13.04. Now, we are working on 13.10.

== New Features in UbuntuKylin 13.10 Alpha 1 Release ==

=== System Requirements ===

A Pentium II or Celeron system with 512 MB of RAM is probably a bottom-line configuration that may yield slow yet usable system with a standard UbuntuKylin desktop.

13.10 32 bit ISO require your CPU to have Physical Address Extensions, or PAE. "PAE is provided by Intel Pentium Pro and above CPUs, including all later Pentium-series processors (except most 400 MHz-bus versions of the Pentium M)." - If you have a NON-PAE CPU and would like to install Ubuntu 12.10, please see <nowiki>[[http://www.webupd8.org/2012/11/how-to-install-ubuntu-1210-on-non-pae.html | this link]]</nowiki> or you can use Ubuntu 12.04 instead.
For Intel based Macs, UbuntuKylin 13.10 should run on all models.
