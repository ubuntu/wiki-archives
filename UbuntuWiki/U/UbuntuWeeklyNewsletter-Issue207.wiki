==== N-imal? ====

Mark Shuttleworth announced the code name for Ubuntu 11.04.

Oh yes, it’s that time of year again, when numerate pollsters make nasal proclamations about the naming of the next next version of Ubuntu. When gazers of balls crystal provide nifty suggestions for new new features and, of course, suitable nomenclature to match.

And so, we come swiftly to a conclusion: allow me to introduce the Natty Narwhal, our mascot for development work that we expect to deliver as Ubuntu 11.04.

To read more about Natty Narwhal and what Mark had to say about the thought process behind the name go to:

==== Join the fun at the Ubuntu Global Jam ====

<nowiki>[[File:quickly-ubuntu-global-jam.png]]</nowiki>

It’s less than two weeks before our ever amazing community joins around the globe to have a good time while improving the incoming Ubuntu release, 10.10, codenamed the Maverick Meerkat.

The Ubuntu Global Jam is a great opportunity to contribute to your favourite OS in any area you can participate in. There are plenty of proposed activities, such as Bugs, Testing, Upgrade, Documentation, Translations, Packaging, but it does not have to stop at that. Why not propose your own activities, or run meetings related to them? Marketing, advocacy… your imagination is the limit.

For more information go to:

==== Ubuntu 10.04.1 LTS released ====

The Ubuntu team is proud to announce the release of Ubuntu 10.04.1 LTS,
the first maintenance update to Ubuntu's 10.04 LTS release.  This
release includes updated server, desktop, and alternate installation CDs
for the i386 and amd64 architectures.

Numerous updates have been integrated, and updated installation
media has been provided so that fewer updates will need to be downloaded
after installation. These include security updates and corrections for
other high-impact bugs, with a focus on maintaining stability and
compatibility with Ubuntu 10.04 LTS.

For more information on how you can download Ubuntu 10.04.1 go to:

https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-announce/2010-August/000134.html

==== 10.10.10.10.10….. ====

So, who’s up for making Maverick Movies? It would be great to have a “10 best features in 10.10″ video collection for release. Unity’s awesome and then there are things to show off in OO.o, Gnome, Firefox…. giving credit where it’s due.

I put together https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MaverickMovies as a starting place to aggregate content. Have subscribed, so if you update that page I’ll see it. If that goes nicely, we can beef the process up in the runup to release.

http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/489

==== Gestures with multitouch in Ubuntu 10.10 ====

Multitouch is just as useful on a desktop as it is on a phone or tablet, so I’m delighted that the first cut of Canonical’s UTouch framework has landed in Maverick and will be there for its release on 10.10.10.

You’ll need 4-finger touch or better to get the most out of it, and we’re currently targeting the Dell XT2 as a development environment so the lucky folks with that machine will get the best results today. By release, we expect you’ll be able to use it with a range of devices from major manufacturers, and with addons like Apple’s Magic Trackpad.

The design team has lead the way, developing a “touch language” which goes beyond the work that we’ve seen elsewhere. Rather than single, magic gestures, we’re making it possible for basic gestures to be chained, or composed, into more sophisticated “sentences”. The basic gestures, or primitives, are like individual verbs, and stringing them together allows for richer interactions. It’s not quite the difference between banging rocks together and conducting a symphony orchestra, but it feels like a good step in the right direction.

==== Ubuntu Translations Interviews: Ricardo Pérez (Spanish Translation Team) ====

Ubuntu is brought to users in their own language by a large community of volunteer translators, who tirelessly work on localizing every part of the operating system on every release.

In this series of interviews we’ll get to know who they are, about their language and how they work.

This week we’re introducing you to Ricardo Pérez, the Spanish translation team coordinator.

==== August 17th Ubuntu LoCo Council IRC Meeting ====

Thanks to all those who came and took part in the meeting. It really is
great to see teams come to these meetings and bringing others with you
to cheer you on makes it very interesting. We are at present having TWO
meetings a month to clear the back log of the re approvals and doing
others as well via email, so we are being kept busy. Every team is so
different and interesting to see how they organise and promote Ubuntu,
it's well worth reading their applications. Full log - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LoCoCouncil/Agenda/20100817

==== Gaming Benchmarks: Windows 7 vs. Ubuntu Linux ====

At the beginning of this month we published workstation benchmarks comparing Windows 7 to Ubuntu Linux. In those tests, which were a continuation of tests from earlier this year when looking to see whether Windows 7 is faster than Ubuntu 10.04 and how fast is Windows compared to Mac OS X and Linux, the two operating systems performed quite closely in our workstation tests with only a few exceptions. Today, however, we are back to looking at the Linux vs. Windows performance of the Lenovo Think``Pad W510 and this time we are looking at the OpenGL gamingperformance between Windows 7 Professional and Ubuntu 10.04 LTS.

=== In Other News ===

==== Multi-touch Support Lands in Maverick ====

Canonical is pleased to announce the release of uTouch 1.0, Ubuntu’s multi-touch and gesture stack. With Ubuntu 10.10 (the Maverick Meerkat), users and developers will have an end-to-end touch-screen framework — from the kernel all the way through to applications. Our multi-touch team has worked closely with the Linux kernel and X.org communities to improve drivers, add support for missing features, and participate in the touch advances being made in open source world. To complete the stack, we’ve created an open source gesture recognition engine and defined a gesture API that provides a means for applications to obtain and use gesture events from the uTouch gesture engine.

==== Canonical Announces the Release of uTouch for Ubuntu OS ====

This week Canonical, the backers of Ubuntu, announced that the next release of Ubuntu 10.10 will ship with a multi-touch and gesture stack called uTouch, which integrates all the way down to the kernellevel. uTouch will include an open source gesture recognition engine and gesture API that software developers can tap into that will make their applications 1/2/3/4 finger touch aware (devs can have a looks at the guidelines here via Mark Shuttleworth). As you’re probably wondering: How many apps out of the box will support this new feature? The answer most likely is…
