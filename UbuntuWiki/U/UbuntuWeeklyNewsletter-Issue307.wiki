==== Mir + Unity QML + Unity APIs = Unity ====

Olli Ries, Engineering Director for Unity and Display Server at Canonical, announces and shares some insights about the Mir display server and Unity QML. According to what Ries calls their ambitious goal, Unity will transition back to Qt/QML, and Mir will replace Xserver in 2013.

==== Not convinced by rolling releases ====

Mark Shuttleworth, responded to the case of rolling releases.  Shuttleworth expresses that he is not convinced of the idea as it injects uncertainty where certainty is needed, among other issues.  The proposal rose up again this year and Shuttleworth allowed the core engineering team at Canonical to create a “trial balloon” proposal.  Shuttleworth noted that the proposal put forward by Rick Spencer was not final action as it was not put forward to the Technical Board and that, though the Community Council was briefed on it, they had not taken action either.

Shuttleworth indicated that there were unexpected findings by the team putting the proposal together.  The releases, the mechanisms for releases, and the release paradigms all presented conundrums that needed to be untangled.  Shuttleworth also indicated that some expectations expressed by stakeholders, such as providing support for PowerPC architecture, were unrealistic based on the nature of today’s consumer market.

Beyond that, Shuttleworth called for an end to what he termed as “melodrama” and indicated that the “sky was not falling.”  While noting that there has been a paradigm shift from integration to leadership, Shuttleworth also stated that those who feel the need to move on should not “poison the well behind them.”  Shuttleworth noted that there is now - what he calls - a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Ubuntu to dominate in the consumer electronics space, and it is time to strike while the iron is hot.

The post ends with questions to try to steer the discussion back into debating the rolling release proposal prior to it being submitted to the Technical Board later in March.

==== Follow Up from "Let's Discuss Interim Releases" ====

Rick Spencer follows up on his original proposal to switch Ubuntu to a Rolling Release. He starts by reassuring that the proposal was a call for discussion, and then invites everyone interested to provide input.  The final proposal is planned to be put to the Technical Board on March 18th.

=== Ubuntu Cloud News ===

==== Lock-In: Why Your OS Choice Matters in the Cloud ====

Robbie Williamson reflects on a recent article, which expresses vendor lock-in concerns in the cloud market. Williamson writes that important choices when selecting an operating system include selecting an independently produced OS, and selecting an OS with service orchestration support. He makes the case for using Ubuntu to fill this role. "Obviously I’m going to encourage the use of Ubuntu Server, but not just because I work for Canonical or am an Ubuntu community member, but because I actually believe it’s currently the best option around."
