* Crew can be found at the top of the daily display schedule.

==== Duties: ====

* Your primary responsibility is to help people who are attending UDS. They might need to know who a track lead is, or where to find something. You can direct them to the desk if you can't answer their question.
* Assist the track leads - sometimes they need AV help from the IS crew or something, usually a crew member will act as a runner.
* On Monday everyone on crew must report to the venue at 7:15am to help set up and guide people into the venue.
* On Monday when the crew shirts arrive please see Michelle/Marianna at the desk to pick up your crew shirt.
* Wear your crew shirt during your day so attendees know you are crewing.
* On your day of assignment report to Marianna *15 minutes before the start of sessions* and ask her if she has any duties for you. These might include last-minute schedule changes or something to that effect.
* Inbetween sessions Sign placement - Help Marianna update the signs on the rooms inbetween sessions.
