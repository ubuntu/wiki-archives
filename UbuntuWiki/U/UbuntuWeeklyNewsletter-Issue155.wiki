==== Karmic Alpha 4 released ====

Welcome to Karmic Koala Alpha 4, which will in time become Ubuntu 9.10. Pre-releases of Karmic are *not* encouraged for anyone needing a stable system or anyone who is not comfortable running into occasional, even frequent breakage. They are, however, recommended for Ubuntu developers and those who want to help in testing, reporting, and fixing bugs.

Alpha 4 is the fourth in a series of milestone CD images that will be released throughout the Karmic development cycle.  The Alpha images are known to be reasonably free of showstopper CD build or installer bugs, while representing a very recent snapshot of Karmic. You can download it here:

* Ubuntu: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/karmic/alpha-4/
* Ubuntu Server UEC: http://uec-images.ubuntu.com/releases/karmic/alpha-4/

==== Developer News ====

* We are very happy to have Julien Lavergne (gilir) join the MOTU team. His great work in Ubuntu and great passion for collaborating with Debian made the decision very easy. https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2009-August/028721.html
* Yulia Novozhilova was recommended for upload privileges for `netbeans` (and related packages). We're very happy to have somebody new being very active with Java-related packages!
* Andy Whitcroft was recommended for upload privileges for the Kernel. His great work clearly spoke for himself.

==== Reporting Ubuntu Community Problems: Jono Bacon ====

Jono has been busy lately on how we report problems and issues in the Ubuntu Community. He has been talking with many people inside the Ubuntu community, at the Community Leadership Summit, and with our Community Council and Technical Board about how to flesh out a better, more effective, and more visible process.

While it is a work in progress, the idea is simple: we want to have a place in which our community can report a problem with a community processes or infrastructure and ensure the relevant group or governance body can be assigned to tend to the issue, discuss it as part of their regular meetings and otherwise have it on their radar. The way this will work is that problems are reported as bugs in the ubuntu-community project and preferably assigned directly to the right group, otherwise, other people can assign the bug to the right group. What is important here is that we clearly define what kind of problems should be assigned where. We will then work with our governance bodies to ensure that as part of their work they review these bugs and help to resolve them. Jono would like to encourage our governance bodies to build these bugs into their work.

The process would look like this:

Step 1: Chose the right place to report the problem

We first need to ensure the right team in the Ubuntu project know about your problem:

* If your problem relates to general community governance or the Community Council then note down communitycouncil
* If your problem relates to technical policies or the Technical Board then note down techboard
* For all other issues you don’t need to note anything down.

Make a note of the team name, we will use in just a moment

Step 2: Report the problem

You can now provide us with some details of the problem. This involves three simple steps:

* Middle click (or press both mouse buttons together) on this link.
* You will be first asked for a Summary. Here type in a short and descriptive single-line summary of the problem.
* You are next asked if your problem already exists in the system and a list of possible existing problems will be shown. You can click the arrows to show more details about each problem.
** If one of the problems describes your problem, click the Yes this is the bug I’m trying to report button.
** If the problem you are reporting is not in the system click the No, I need to report a new bug button.
* On next page do the following:
** Type in some details about the problem in the Further Information box. Try to be as detailed in your description as possible.
** Click the Extra Options link and in the Assign to box write in the team name you wrote down above. If you didn’t write down a team, or you don’t know it, don’t worry, just leave this box blank.
** Finally click the Submit bug report button.

When your problem has been filed, you will receive an email with a link to the problem in Launchpad, and you can view that link to see the latest details about the problem.

Jono has documented this process here and also created two other documents which will help us improve it:

* Best Practice - much of what I am hoping we can achieve is building best practice around how we handle reported community problems. As an example, in some cases we will want to develop a spec or solution out of problems to help move it forward. Note down areas of best practice on this page. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ReportingCommunityProblems/BestPractice
* Feedback - opinions and ideas on the process and what does and does not work can be added on this page. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ReportingCommunityProblems/Feedback

Jono would like to review this process at UDS to see how well it works.

=== LoCo News ===

==== Ubuntu US Teams ====

Pleia2 has been working with the US Teams project. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/USTeams This is the mentoring team for all the the US teams and this year they reorganized the project and elected a new board and mentors. Liz has been working with Dan Trevino to launch the new US Teams Planet http://planet.ubuntu-us.org/ for aggregating the news feeds for teams in the US (it’s been a great way to see what other teams are up to!). John Crawford also helped to launch a new version of our website. http://ubuntu-us.org/ Pliea2, Dan Trevino, and John Crawford are the board members for the reorganized US Teams Project.

The latest team news? We’re now publishing articles on our new website! There is a lot of Lo``Co documentation out there, but it can sometimes be tricky to find really useful stuff. Having identified the vital resources, our articles have the following purpose:

* Identify the documentation that we reference most for US Teams, write short articles highlighting where to find this documentation so it puts it on the radar of more people, and contributing back to the main documentation as we can
* Come up with new ideas, write articles about it, contribute back to the main documentation
* US News – approvals, sharing successful new ideas
* US-specific tips about running a Lo``Co in this country

The next US Team meeting is scheduled for August 26th 2009 – 10pm EDT, 9pm CDT, 8pm MDT, 7pm PDT in #ubuntu-us – join us then to discuss the project, or drop by #ubuntu-us any time to get help with your US-based Lo``Co, share experiences, request a mentor or just shoot the breeze with other folks in the US who participate in Lo``Co teams.

==== UbuCon Atlanta 2009 ====

The first Ubu``Con Atlanta (Ubuntu conference) will take place during the Atlanta Linux Fest. This is a chance to bring together the Ubuntu community for a day of all things Ubuntu. We are calling all Lo``Co teams and ubuntu community members to come together and share your knowledge and excitement for forwarding the Ubuntu project.

* Note what you would be interested in talking about under the BoF sessions. Post the topic with the lead of Ubu``Con - Topic. http://atlantalinuxfest.org/node/add/suggested-bof

Ready for Ubuntu 9.10? - Want to know if your hardware will work with the upcoming release of Karmic Koala, Ubuntu 9.10? Members of the Ubuntu kernel team will be on hand with custom built USB sticks that will boot and run a test suite. This will not touch the hard disk and will let users know what of the new kernel/hardware features will work on their machine. Bring your machine and help improve Ubuntu 9.10!

Live Hack Session - Interested in learning how to hack drivers? The Ubuntu kernel team will be running a live hack session to show you how! Using a USB dongle that is a thermometer and a "shell" driver, users will walked through writing the drivers, compiling it, and running it.

==== Brazilian Council and new Brazilian Ubuntu Members ====

Recent changes in the previous Ubuntu Brazilian Council, through an election that had three chosen candidates:

* André Gondim: http://launchpad.net/~andregondim
* Fábio Nogueira: http://launchpad.net/~deb-user-ba
* Laudeci Oliveira – Pretto: http://launchpad.net/~laudeci

Fábio Nogueira was re-elected to the post.

In this process, every candidate listed his plans if elected, and the election consisted of three phases. In each phase, Brazilian official members voted, selecting one Council member per round. The first elected was André Gondim, followed by Fábio Ogueira and then Laudeci Oliveira. Very soon the council intends to publish their ideas and what’s next to come.

New Members

The Brazilian Community is happy to announce its two newest Ubuntu Members:

* Carlos “Coringão” Donizete: https://edge.launchpad.net/~coringao
* Ursula Junque, a.k.a. Ursinha: https://edge.launchpad.net/~ursinha

Coringao is the owner of Ubuntu Games, he’s very active and helpful in Ubuntu Games and development of IUG (Instalador do Ubuntu Games).

Ursinha is an active member, helping with community support and the maintenance of Translations’s wiki. She is really helpful with new users at #ubuntu-br.

The Brazilian Council is proud of you both.

=== Launchpad News ===

==== Zim and the art of wiki development ====

Zim is a desktop wiki that uses both Launchpad and Bazaar. Matthew Revell asked Jaap Karssenberg, its founder and main developer, about the project.

Matthew: How does Zim compare with something like Tomboy?

Jaap: I really don’t know as I never used Tomboy for an extensive amount of time — it wasn’t around yet when I first started with Zim. From interface design I get the feeling Tomboy is designed as a replacement for sticky notes while Zim was designed as a replacement for an outliner. I think Zim is more tailored towards structuring notes. But Tomboy is moving fast as it has seemingly more developers and of course it gets traction from being included in Gnome.

Matthew: Do you think desktop wikis will eventually take over from larger applications, such as Open``Office.org Writer, now that we’re increasingly producing documents for distribution online rather than via paper?

Jaap: I don’t think so, both serve different purposes. Wikis are very useful for storing information and building a knowledge base. Websites to some point have the same use cases, so a program like Zim can be used to build a website (in fact the Zim website itself is maintained in Zim). Office applications on the other hand are used when the focus is on layout and presentation of the data (e.g. writer and presenter) or do specialized calculations (e.g. calc). In my own workflow, I use Zim to collect notes about all my ongoing projects and this changes from day to day. When I need to produce a document these notes are the raw material, but I use an office application to produce a polished document. When such a document is finished it is published and does not change anymore.

Matthew: One of the great advantages of web-based wikis is collaboration. Does Zim have any features to enable collaboration?

Jaap: Zim has plugins to use version control like Bazaar or Subversion on the wiki data. My take on collaboration is that it can be done for a wiki the same way it can be done for code. Obviously you would need some better graphical interfaces for non-programmers to use it, but why not. This features doubles as backup mechanism and as synchronization. I especially like Bazaar for this due to it’s decentralized nature which fits a document concept real well.

Matthew: Are you looking for contributors?

Jaap: Always. Now it is just me on two nights a week and one or two irregular patch submitters. But we do have a lot of translators contributing already and
someone working on windows packages, which is very good. Still I feel the project is to much driven by a single developer.

Matthew: Why did you choose Launchpad and Bazaar?

Jaap: Bazaar was a logical choice as I was an avid Arch user before subversion and other modern version control systems arrived on the scene.

In the past I hosted projects on Sourceforge because I didn’t have my own hosting and needed centralized CVS etc. After some frustration I moved to Gnu Arch for version control and started hosting myself. But I started using Launchpad to allow translators to contribute and gradually discovered more useful features. I still have my own hosting contract for the website and put the bazaar branches there, but Launchpad is useful for contributors of other branches, translations and the bug tracker. Also running the mailing list there since my hosting provider doesn’t offer one. In short it spares me the work of setting up and maintaining those services myself.

==== Dave Walker: Ubuntu Server Tips - Help wanted ====

Something the Ubuntu Server Team has been working on is getting some useful little tips into the Ubuntu Server. We all have little gems that we use, making daily server administration easier. This is your chance to help, and share your wisdom with everyone else.

A tip can be something like: “Ubuntu Server Tip: Browse the command line history with ctrl-r and then type a few characters that you know are part of the command you are looking for.”

The current roadmap suggests a tip like the above will be displayed after login, via motd (message of the day).

How can you help? Currently there is a shortage of tips, and translations of these into other languages. They think they can easily get in excess of 500 soon.

So if you have a little gem of wisdom that is reasonably short, raise a bug and include a short description as a title, and include the tip as the main description. If it is accepted, it will be included. https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-server-tips/+filebug

Translations are another big part of this project, it’s only fair that people see these nuggets in their native language – so if you are capable, we would really appreciate help translating into different languages. Launchpad makes this area very easy to contribute to. https://translations.launchpad.net/ubuntu-server-tips

Once they have a few more tips, Dave will throw out a call for testing.

==== Pleia2: Ubuntu Community Learning Project ====

Over the past several months the team has been working through licensing choices, Moodle deployment (theme still to be completed), governing and user infrastructure. They’ve begun working with teams within the community and have met with the Canonical Training folks to discuss materials and overlap of services.

Now, they need you! Martin Owens has also posted about it[1], so if you’re interested and haven’t yet, have a peek at that post as well as he outlines some of the skills we need. Essentially, we need brains! [1]: http://doctormo.wordpress.com/2009/08/11/ubuntu-learning-organised/

=== In The Press ===

==== Open Source Television ====

Mike Riley of Dr. Dobb's recognizes that technologists and consumers alike have been waiting years for "the ultimate media convergence appliance". Numerous attempts have strived to attain this coveted dream device but none have yet captured the gold medal. This myopic view of customers has given open media device vendor Neuros an entry into this race. The Neuros LINK is essentially a quiet x86 PC running Ubuntu Linux with an ATI graphics card delivering video via VGA, DVI, and HDMI output. To help sprout the Neuros LINK to a tech-savvy media convergence seeker, Neuros has seeded the developer community with a special "gamma edition" of the Neuros LINK. The gamma currently arrives pre-installed with Ubuntu 8.10, although Neuros plans to upgrade to version 9.04 in the commercial version. The Neuros distribution is preloaded with all the audio/video codecs necessary to view the various popular media formats, ranging from AVI, FLV, MP3, MP4, OGV and others that the installed MPlayer, VLC and Xine open source video players support. Check out the Neuros LINK Wiki for a more comprehensive list of the LINK's technical specifications. http://www.ddj.com/linux-open-source/219100482

==== Ubuntu 9.10 "Karmic Koala" Alpha 4 Released ====

Phoronix's Michael Larabel reports that right on schedule, Canonical's Steve Langasek has announced the release of Ubuntu 9.10 Alpha 4. This fourth development release of the Karmic Koala brings more updated packages (including a kernel based upon Linux 2.6.31-rc5), Ubuntu One file sharing support, and some other new features. Ubuntu 9.10 Alpha 4 is also the first build to have Kubuntu Netbook Remix support for KDE 4.3 and Ubuntu UEC. Ubuntu UEC is for the Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud with support for Amazon's EC2 service. The release announcement with 9.10 Alpha 4 download links for Ubuntu, Ubuntu Server UEC, Kubuntu, Xubuntu, Ubuntu Studio, and Mythbuntu can be found on ubuntu-devel-announce. More information surrounding this release is also available from the Ubuntu Testing page. The next release in the Ubuntu 9.10 series is Alpha 5, which is penciled in for a release on the 3rd of September. The final release of Ubuntu 9.10 "Karmic Koala" will come on the 29th of October. http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=NzQ1Mg

==== Technical School changes to Ubuntu and saves Millions ====

PMA Box tells us that the Icelandic National TV channel RUV broadcasted a news story yesterday 11 August 2009 entitled "Nýtt kerfi sparar milljónir", which translates to "New system saves millions." A technical school located in the North of Iceland "Akureyri" saves 5 million Kronas by changing the operating system of the school computers to open source Ubuntu. They also point the fact that it was an easy change without any need of extra hardware or additional costs. Also, they urge other public institutions to follow the example and save money in license fees in this time of world crisis. http://www.pmabox.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=26:technical-school-changes-to-ubuntu-and-saves-milli

=== In The Blogosphere ===

==== Dell’s Ubuntu Strategy: Restoring My Faith ====

Joe Panettieri, writing for Works With U, is feeling better about Dell's strategy concerning Ubuntu.  Though Dell hasn't yet addressed the question of whether or not they will offer a desktop machine with Ubuntu, it has released the information that it will be offering Ubuntu on the new Smart``Books.  Also, it will upgrade to the latest release of Ubuntu on the netbooks.  More information is available at:  http://www.workswithu.com/2009/08/13/dells-ubuntu-strategy-regaining-my-faith/

==== Kubuntu Netbook Release Coming ====

J.A. Watson, writing in his blog attached to ZDNET-UK, is excited about the news that there will be a Kubuntu 9.04 netbook release.  He's tried the Ubuntu Netbook Remix, and feels that it lacks something.  Also the regular release relies on functionality that the netbooks lack.  He has hopes that, as the Kubuntu netbook release is finished up, it will be more a case of adjusting the distribution to the architecture rather than the major changes that are done with the Ubuntu Netbook Remix.  See his comments at:  http://community.zdnet.co.uk/blog/0,1000000567,10013420o-2000498448b,00.htm

==== System76 Refreshes, Expands Ubuntu Netbook and Desktop Lineup ====

Joe Panettieri, writing for Works With U, notes that System76 is adding 2 Gig of memory to their Starling Netbooks, as well as adding Ubuntu to the System76 nVidia Meerkat Ion and Leopard Extreme Intel i7 Desktops.  On the down side, Dell still hasn't come out with information on an Ubuntu desktop, and US Big Box retailers are moving away from Linux netbooks.  His report is at:  http://www.workswithu.com/2009/08/11/system76-refreshes-expands-ubuntu-netbook-and-desktop-lineup/

==== An Early Look at Ubuntu 9.10 Karmic Koala - Overview & Screenshots ====

Craciun Dan at Tuxarena provides us with a first look at Karmic Koala, with screenshots.  Ubuntu 9.10 comes with the Ubuntu One application for syncing and sharing information, Empathy replacing Pidgin, ext4 filesystem as the default and Grub2 as the new boot manager.  His whole write up is available at:  http://tuxarena.blogspot.com/2009/08/early-look-at-ubuntu-910-karmic-koala.html

==== Free Book Review: Ubuntu Pocket Guide and Reference ====

Craciun Dan at Tuxarena gives a brief overview of the Ubuntu Pocket Guide and Reference written by Keir Thomas.  His section by section look at what's in the book demonstrates that it is a good, general, overview of Ubuntu and some of it's capabilities.  The book is available as a free PDF download from http://www.ubuntupocketguide.com/index_main.html or as a print edition from Amazon.com for USD 11,99.  See his site for details:  http://tuxarena.blogspot.com/2009/08/free-book-review-ubuntu-pocket-guide.html

==== Ubuntu Coming to Amahi Home Server? ====

Joe Panettieri, writing for Works With U, notes that Amahi is working on a home server drop-in for Ubuntu.  Right now, it's being developed on Ubuntu 9.04, and is still in its early stages.  From the Amahi wiki: “We just started porting Amahi to Ubuntu. The support is highly experimental. There are a few important things to be fixed before you can run it with minimal tweaking. Please don’t try it on a production server yet."  His report is available at:  http://www.workswithu.com/2009/08/12/ubuntu-coming-to-amahi-home-server/

==== Ubuntu Support for Non-Geeks ====

Although this has been touched on, before, Christopher Tozzi of Works With U does a good job of explaining the what and why of the entry-level “Starter Desktop” support package.  Though it seems rather light for someone with a little experience in dealing with Ubuntu, it may be just what is needed for those migrating from Windows or Mac OS X.  This report goes into more detail at:  http://www.workswithu.com/2009/08/10/ubuntu-support-for-non-geeks/

==== ZaReason Launches Ubuntu Linux Netbook ====

Joe Panettieri, writing for Works With U, informs us that Za``Reason is launching an Ubuntu Linux netbook called the Terra A20.  CTO Earl Malmrose has said that, “Since Za``Reason isn’t beholden to operating system vendors that place artificial restrictions on system specs, we’ve loaded the Terra up with lots of great features.”  Along with Dell and System76, this looks like an area on which to keep watch.  His article is at:  http://www.workswithu.com/2009/08/12/zareason-launches-ubuntu-linux-netbook/
