=== The Planet ===

==== Ubuntu App Developer Blog: A Fast Thumbnailer for Ubuntu ====

Michi Henning records how James Henstridge, Xavi Garcia Mena and herself have implemented a fast and scalable “thumbnailing service” for Ubuntu & Ubuntu Touch. The service is extremely fast, scalable (location independent), low in bandwidth use, robust (fault tolerant), and secure.

http://developer.ubuntu.com/en/blog/2015/08/17/fast-thumbnailer-ubuntu/

==== Svetlana Belkin: Membership Board Member Interviews: Alan Pope ====

Svetlana Belkin continues her series of interviews with members of the Ubuntu Membership Board. In the sixth of the series, Alan Pope talks about his career at Canonical, his first computing experience, and some of the projects that he’s worked on over the years. When asked if he had any comments to share with the community he says: “I’ve really enjoyed being part of the community. It’s a great feeling contributing to a free software project, and I hope to continue for as long as I can.”

==== Daniel Holbach: Snapcraft has landed in the archive ====

Daniel Holbach writes about using snapcraft() in C++, and turning software into snaps. Noting that it's a .01 release, he says that bugs are to be expected, but if you’re using Wily, the PPA is provided for you to try it out. Daniel embeds a short video in his post entitled "Packaging A Java Application For snappy" which shows an example of what snapcraft can do for you.

https://daniel.holba.ch/blog/2015/08/snapcraft-has-landed-in-the-archiv/

==== Svetlana Belkin: Ubuntu Membership Pages Update ====

Svetlana Belkin writes that during the last online summit the Membership Board held a session about getting more people to apply for membership. She links to both the main wiki page and the FAQ which have been updated to remove some confusion and remind the community of the benefits of membership. Svetlana ends her post by saying: “As a close, the Membership Board is asking that if you want to become a Member, please apply!”

==== Aquaris E4.5 and E5 Ubuntu Editions debut in India with Snapdeal ====

Canonical announces that the Aquaris E4.5 and Aquaris E5 Ubuntu Edition handsets are set to launch in India through Snapdeal, India’s largest online marketplace by the end of August. They say that the launch follows on from two successful launches in Europe earlier this year, and that prices will be Rs 11,999 for the E4.5 and Rs 13,499 for the E5.

==== Using the content hub on Ubuntu ====

Stuart Langridge writes about Ubuntu phone security and how apps keep their files isolated from each other by design. Sometimes, however, you want to share files between apps, which is the purpose of the Content Hub. Stuart found Ubuntu’s Content Hub under-documented, so this post documents (the basics of) what he discovered and how to use the Ubuntu Phone Content Hub, something especially useful for phone app developers.

http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2015/08/20/using-the-content-hub-on-ubuntu/

==== Clock App Update: August 2015 ====

Nekhelesh Ramananthan summarizes the changes made to the Clock app and thanks Bartosz Kosiorek for his help with the release and coordinating with the Canonical designers. Nekhelesh shows us some screenshots of the updated app and lists some of the bugs that have been fixed.
