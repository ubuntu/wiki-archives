=== Summary ===

To select one or more from hundreds or thousands of items (such as products or people), Launchpad has a standard control that retrieves suggestions based on text you type. This control is implemented using Xml''''''Http and Java''''''Script, and is similar to that used in <nowiki>[[http://www.google.com/webhp?complete=1|Google Suggest]]</nowiki>.
