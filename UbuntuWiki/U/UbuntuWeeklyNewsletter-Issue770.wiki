Aaron Prisk delineates the Ubuntu Community Documentation Modernization Initiative. Aaron provides us with the initial goals, some subsequent goals & links so we can help join in this effort. Many additional links are provided.

https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/community-documentation-modernization-initiative/33116

==== Governance ====

Aaron Prisk has created a wiki page on the Ubuntu Community Forum to help readers understand the Governance of the Ubuntu project. We are reminded that the project "draws a very diverse community of participants", and the binding to the Code of Conduct. Additional disclosures include: the Ubuntu Boards - which include the Ubuntu Community Council, and the Ubuntu Technical Board. We are reminded it's not a democracy, but meritocracy, and told the role of SABDFL (Mark Shuttleworth), and delegation of board members and teams (including Lo``Cos).

https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/governance/33114

==== Mir release 2.11.0 ====

Alan Griffiths tells us about Mir 2.11.0 which is a 'technical' release as requested by the UBports community. We are told this release aids the uploading of Lomiri to "Debian bookworm", and that a Mir 2.11.1 release is expected shortly. We are given the ABI summary, enhancements included, plus bug fix implemented in this release.

==== New image for existing flavor: Xubuntu Minimal ====

Steve Langasek, on behalf of the Ubuntu Release Team, writes that the Xubuntu team will be releasing a new Xubuntu Minimal ISO image starting with Ubuntu 23.04's release. We are told it'll be targeted at a classic CD-ROM in size, and no impact on existing infrastructure is expected.

==== UnityX 7.7: available for testing ====

Rudra Saraswat reminds us of the work to get Unity 7.7 working without Compiz - wherein Wayland support is coming soon, which has led to this "new variant of Unity 7" titled UnityX. We are told this 'supersedes' a prior effort, including all features of Unity 7, with more customization options, and doesn't require any of Ubuntu's GTK patches. A link to the gitlab source is provided, along with many screenshots and a discussion of the features of UnityX. For the "true tech aficionados" a brief discussion of the Advanced configuration options is provided, with examples. Feedback is welcome.

==== Help Test GNOME’s New ‘Window Focus’ Behaviour ====

Joey Sneddon writes that a "new 'window focus' animation for GNOME Shell is available to test”. We are introduced to this feature with quotes from Tobias Bernard, a GNOME design team member. We are told it runs on GNOME 43, with examples shown via an embedded GIF image. We are warned not to expect anything "revolutionary" as the effect is "subtle". A link to the GNOME discourse thread is provided for more details.

==== GNOME 42.8 Enables Atomic Mode-Setting for NVIDIA/GBM, Improves Wayland and AMDGPU Support ====

Marius Nestor writes of Jeremy Bicha's announcement on the release of GNOME 42.8. Marius expresses the view that it's a small update, before providing details of what is updated in the release, especially for some NVIDIA video card users. All existing GNOME 42 users are advised to upgrade, with the upcoming release timetable of GNOME given.

==== Ubuntu's Real-Time Kernel Approaching GA Status ====

Michael Larabel reminds us that Ubuntu 22.04 has had a beta real-time kernel offering, that has slowly improved. We are advised that it's now approaching general availability (GA) status. Giving details of the official release (via tweet), we are told on release that it'll be available to Ubuntu Pro / Ubuntu Advantage users; which is free for personal use. A brief discussion of upstream RT patches, and a git link are also provided.

Marius Nestor alerts us to Ubuntu kernel security fixes for Ubuntu 22.10, Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, as well as Ubuntu 16.04 & 14.04 ESM. We are given details of the CVEs fixed, who discovered the flaw and how it can be misused against our systems, plus releases impacted. The kernel version with the fixes applied is given, with a reminder to update our systems as soon as possible & reboot.

==== KDE Frameworks 5.102 Enables File Transfers over 2GB in KDE Connect ====

Marius Nestor relates to us the updates in the KDE Project's release of KDE Frameworks 5.102. In the many changes Marius prominently notes these: KDE Connect can now transfer files greater than 2GB, changes in modifier keys, file handling enhancements, Plasma Wayland improvements, and widget response corrections. Marius tells us there are more than 140 changes in the release, and recommends updating as soon as KDE Frameworks 5.102 packages land in the stable software repositories.

==== Ubuntu OnAir: Ubuntu Summit 2022 | Freelancing (and more) with Free Software ====

"The Ubuntu 22.04 release video created by Freehive was an example of the kind of professional work that is possible using Ubuntu and other free and open source creative tools. Ryan Gorley, the Creative Director at Freehive, will share the background behind his agency's use of open source software in its graphic design, animation, and other work for clients large and small. His goal in the presentation is to help creative professionals who aspire to be free of restrictive, expensive, and coercive commercial software to recognize the opportunities freely available to them. He will suggest a course, through his own experience, for their own adoption of community developed and supported alternatives."
