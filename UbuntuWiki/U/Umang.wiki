<nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~umang|Umang on Launchpad]]</nowiki>

I'm a Ubuntu and Debian user. I switch between the two, but try to contribute to both. I report a bug whenever I find one, and try to help anyone I can.

Like many others, I've started a couple of open-source projects  - <nowiki>[[http://launchpad.net/pynagram|Pynagram]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[http://launchpad.net/youngcms|YoungCMS]]</nowiki>. Both were projects I started to learn various things about coding and contribute beyond basic programming. Although I don't think they were significant contributions by any means, they've helped me learn a lot about FOSS and I hope to take what I've learned and now make less irrelevant contributions.

I recently restructured and partially rewrote the <nowiki>[[PackagingGuide-Python|Python Packaging Guide]]</nowiki> on the Ubuntu Team Wiki. I now intend to contribute to Ubuntu/Debian using packaging skills I hope to pick up.
