Hi,

I'm looking forward meeting a Mentor, that can help me to
become a better Ubuntu contributor.

Thanks in advance.

</pre>

In the meanwhile a mentor will send you a confirmation e-mail, please note that we will assign a mentor with a different nationality than you. In the meanwhile, You can start reading the team documentation:

** <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DesktopTeam|Desktop team]]</nowiki>.
** <nowiki>[[http://mythbuntu.org/gettinginvolved|Mythbuntu team]]</nowiki>.
** <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kubuntu/GettingInvolved|Kubuntu team]]</nowiki>.
** <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Edubuntu/Community/GetInvolved|Edubuntu team]]</nowiki>.
** <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MOTU|MOTU team]]</nowiki>.

Once you have received the confirmation e-mail follow the mentor's instructions. What ''''don't'''' needs to be done:

** Ask help to the mentor in private, never or rarely ask the help in private. The mentors aren't perfect so please, '''always''' ask in #ubuntu-motu.
** Think that a mentor is a robot. We aren't bot or something, we're human like you.
** Ask the change of the mentor. We can't change the mentor once it's assigned so please, be comprehensive.
