=== General Community News ===

==== MOTU Council ====
Ahmed El-Mahmoudy's (أحمد المحمودي) great work on packages, his interaction with Debian and work on the Sabily distributions left us no other choice but to say +1.

After an interesting discussion about Java packaging, the Server team and cheese the MC found out that they would very much like to see Thierry Carrez in ~ubuntu-core-dev. Hence our recommendation.

Andrea Gasparini did a great work in the MOTU community, working on lots of different packages. His great love for QA and working with Debian and love for the Italian Lo``Co sealed the deal: +1 from all present MC members.

Andreas Moog's great work on Desktop and other packages, his great attention to detail and work with Debian made the decision pretty easy. He's just joined the MOTU team.

==== New Ubuntu Members ====

The approval results from the last Americas Membership meeting are as follows:

Christian Reis: Christian manages the Launchpad engineering team. In addition to his

We're very happy to welcome these very deserving new members to the project!

==== First Paper Cut milestone reached ====

The first One Hundred Paper Cuts milestone was completed on time! Ten Ubuntu paper cuts and one Kubuntu paper cut were fixed. One hundred paper cuts is a project led by Canonical's Design and User Experience team to improve user experience in Ubuntu by identifying 100 small points of pain for users, or "paper cuts", and healing them!

1. Width of notifications seem arbitrarily small: https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/notify-osd/+bug/336110

2. “Archive Manager” doesn’t mean anything if you don’t know what an “archive” is: https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/file-roller/+bug/15495

3. “Write in this folder” is confusing terminology: https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nautilus-share/+bug/385801

4. Drag and drop of images is dangerous in evince and too easy to perform: https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/evince/+bug/379403

5. ‘Open With’ Nautilus list is unsorted: https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nautilus/+bug/360553

6. Set “open” animation to glide 2, not glide 1: https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/compiz/+bug/195737

7. Search button does not toggle search field: https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nautilus/+bug/57210

8. Spellcheck in [Pidgin], Evolution, gedit etc doesn’t recognize “Ubuntu”: https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/aspell-en/+bug/15200

9. volume is set to zero when changed in fullscreen mode: https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gtk+2.0/+bug/137041

10. “Clean up by name” -> “Arrange items by name”: https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/hundredpapercuts/+bug/388949

11. Power``Devil plasma applet is too skinny, clipping off the sides of the applet: https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/kdebase-workspace/+bug/379192

Now it’s time to get working on next week’s milestone, or any of the other paper cuts targeted for Karmic. One thing desperately needed is more people writing patches. If you are able to patch applications like Nautilus, please grab a paper cut and have at it. Many of the fixes are one-liners, so they’re an easy way to score some karma.

* Next week's milestone: https://edge.launchpad.net/hundredpapercuts/+milestone/round-2
* Other open paper cuts: https://edge.launchpad.net/hundredpapercuts/karmic

==== Tracking Ubuntu Community Issues (Jono Bacon) ====

Recently Melissa wrote a post about how we track problems with community, and how she feels that blogging about community problems is a reasonable approach. As part of her post she says: Blogging about problems we see in our community should be seen as a good thing, not a bad thing. Why? Because this blogging is action. The alternative is no action, and that is much worse.

Jono agrees with Melissa that we need a better way to track issues with community. While blogging has become a tremendous tool in online communities and enabled community members to have a platform in which to share their opinions, ideas, perspectives and achievements, he doesn’t feel blogging is the most suitable means of tracking community issues, improvements and regressions.

Blog entries are single shot capsules of feedback, wisdom and opinion ejected onto the Internet and often aggregated in places such as Planet Ubuntu. They are typically highly personalized, lurking in personally-driven locations (such as a homepage or personal blog), have no facilities for applying status, assignment, milestones or priority, provide little or no means to subscribe to specific problems, and lack facilities for communicating when a problem has been solved: if the issue is resolved the blog is sometimes updated and sometimes not.

Aside from more elegant and better directed methods of communicating that a problem exists, we ideally want to attach problem-solving capabilities to the reporting of an issue: I care only a small amount about hearing the problem, what I am really interested in is collaborating with that person and others in trying to find a solution. Blog entries are not really cut out for that kind of collaboration. Bugs are though!!

Bug reporting systems were designed to allow people to collaborate around defects in software and include facilities to identify, track, prioritize, milestone, subscribe and share information. Although everyone complains about bug reporting systems, they are generally productive in finding problems, developing solutions and having visibility over the lifespan of a problem.

Jono thinks it could be useful for us to use Launchpad for filing bugs for community, process and governance issues. To this end he has registered the Ubuntu Community project in Launchpad which we can use for tracking these kinds of bugs. https://edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu-community

There are some benefits to this:

* Visibility - this is going to help everyone keep visible on community issues. On a slightly selfish note, this will also help me keep visibility over issues for me and my team at Canonical. This should mean more bang for your buck with your friendly horsemen.

* Tracking / Triage - this will make tracking, prioritization, feedback and potential milestoning much easier.

* Assignment - this improved visibility will help us assign bugs better to the right people.

* Familiar - many of us live and breath bug reports: the interface is part of the furniture. No new systems to learn, no random blog entries to keep an eye on.

Jono just set up the project, and we will need some documentation, guidance and best practice written and shared around these bugs, and this will take a little while to be developed. As such, you may have some questions which we will need to document the answers to over the coming weeks. In the meantime we can work with existing bugs and file new bugs there. Feedback on this is of course welcome!

==== Kubuntu Tutorials Day ====

The development team is working hard on Kubuntu Karmic. Join them in these tutorials to learn how to help out with Kubuntu and KDE generally.

* When is it? Monday June 29th from 19:00UTC

* Where is it? On freenode IRC chat network in the #kubuntu-devel channel

Visit the link below to see the schedule of sessions available.

https://wiki.kubuntu.org/KubuntuTutorialsDay

==== Introducing the Ubuntu NGO team ====

The Ubuntu NGO team had it's first meeting recently in IRC. What does NGO stand for?

According to Wikipedia "Non-governmental organization (NGO) is a term that has become widely accepted for referring to a legally constituted, people from non-governmental organization created by natural or legal persons with no participation or representation of any government. In the cases in which NGOs are funded totally or partially by governments, the NGO maintains its non-governmental status therefore it excludes government representatives from membership in the organization. Unlike the term intergovernmental organization, 'non-governmental organization' is a term in generalized use but not a legal definition, in many jurisdictions these type of organizations are defined as 'civil society organizations' or alternative terms."

Many of these NGOs do great work all around the world and the Ubuntu community shares a lot of the NGO ideals and spirit: Ubuntu means "I am what I am because of who we all are" and it's what brings us together. Currently there are great initiatives within the Ubuntu Community to share the technological expertise with NGOs. The Ubuntu-NGO team seeks to ensure that Ubuntu becomes a very resourceful platform for NGOs and it re-energizes the great work done by teams across the world. We want to make Ubuntu work great for NGOs and make it help them in their daily work.

By visiting the link below you can read an interview with team members and get a better feel for the team.

==== Extra options when filing bugs ====

There are now two new levels of options for those filing bugs.  The first, for the average person, is that they can now set tags when filing bugs.  It's not yet wired up with the magical tag auto-completer that you can use on the bug page itself, but that’s coming.  For bug supervisors, there are some new options in the "Extra options" area to set initial status, the importance and milestone of the bug, and to assign it to someone to work on.

=== In The Press ===

==== Berlin art colleges switch to Linux ====

Heise Online reports that Berlin's art colleges are completely switching over to Linux. Most of the productivity software on the workstations has already been swapped for free alternative products as part of a project that started over eighteen months ago. Starting in June, their workstation PCs will switch to Ubuntu Linux and their servers will use Debian. The change is being made because the existing hardware cannot be upgraded to Windows Vista or Windows 7 and the colleges would have had to spend five-figure sums to buy newer hardware and pay additional license fees for Windows. The money that they've saved is now going to be spent on teaching. As part of the changeover, the colleges are also developing platform-independent software to manage teaching and working contracts. The application is being licensed under the GPLv3 and, after its completion, will be available to all users. http://www.heise.de/english/newsticker/news/141153

==== Ubuntu may increase Mono-dependent apps ====

iT``Wire's Sam Varghese says that the next release of the popular Ubuntu distribution may include a third Mono-dependent application by default according to Gerry Carr, a spokesman for Canonical. "That's an interesting question. Really, it is Ubuntu's board of governance, not Canonical whose policy you want as they decide what goes in the distro. The board have been asked the same thing recently and are considering it but I do not have a time line for a decision but I will track and push as far as I can." Mono is a software project begun some years ago by current Novell vice-president Miguel de Icaza to create an open source clone of Microsoft's .NET development environment. http://www.itwire.com/content/view/25900/1231/

==== Shuttle XS29f: Linux Looks Great in Green ====

Paul Ferrill of Linux Planet notes that power and space saving computers are in, and Shuttle has a winner with the XS29F. This little gem really skimps on the power consumption to the tune of around 20-25 watts on average. That's less than half of that 60-watt light bulb shining down on you right now. This system is really responsive running multiple applications including the latest versions of Firefox, Open Office, the GIMP and VLC. Ubuntu is especially great about helping you find the right plugin for things like "other" media formats when it doesn't recognize something. The Shuttle XS96f is a great little box for the DIY user looking for a small form factor with an eye toward saving on the power bill. We had our box up and running the latest Ubuntu release in under 30 minutes, so you shouldn't shy away thinking the "some assembly required" part too tough. http://www.linuxplanet.com/linuxplanet/reviews/6783/1/

==== System76 Bonobo Professional ====

Michael Larabel of Phoronix reminds us that back in March Phoronix reviewed the System76 Serval Professional Notebook and found it to be an excellent contender at the time. One of the new notebooks to recently leave the System76 facilities is the Bonobo Professional, which packs an Intel Core 2 Quad Q9000 processor and an impressive NVIDIA Ge``Force GTX 280M discrete graphics processor. The System76 Bonobo Professional starts out at $1,769 USD and can go all the way up to $4,754 if factoring in the highest-end hardware available through System76 and backing it with a three-year warranty and three years worth of technical support. The build quality of this notebook is also great and the features like eSATA connectivity, Firewire, a large keyboard, and web camera are all excellent too. Of course, with this notebook coming from System76, there is complete Ubuntu Linux support for this notebook. http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=system76_bonobo_pro&num=1

==== Ubuntu's First 100 Paper Cuts, Some Bandaged ====

Phoronix's Michael Larabel tells us that last week the first ten Ubuntu paper cuts were exposed via Launchpad, which are small annoying usability problems with Ubuntu (and upstream applications) that are quite easy to address but simply have not been carried out. In time for the release of Ubuntu 9.10, Canonical hopes to have 100 of these "paper cuts" addressed. In less than a week, 100 of these paper cuts have been tagged in Launchpad and there's a few more in there too for the KDE version of Ubuntu, Kubuntu. These Ubuntu paper cuts are split into ten groups and at least one group of bugs should be addressed per week. However, some of the bugs in the later groups are already being addressed at this time. These small bugs range from missing thumbnails on Open``Document files to over-sized dialog boxes. The 100 paper cuts for Ubuntu 9.10 "Karmic Koala" can be found on Launchpad. http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=NzM0NQ

==== Ubuntu tech board plays down Mono IP concerns ====

Sam Varghese of iT``Wire reports that the Ubuntu technical board appears to have decided that there is no significant cause for IP concern over Mono, the contentious clone of Microsoft's .NET development environment. The Ubuntu Foundation's technical lead Colin Watson wrote on June 16: "In short, at the moment, Mono is very well-maintained in Ubuntu and there appears to be no significant cause for concern over its IP situation. We will attempt to clarify in suitable places what developers and/or rights holders should do in the event that they have evidence of a problem." http://www.itwire.com/content/view/25949/1231/

==== Is Ubuntu Linux Ready for the Enterprise? ====

eWeek's Don Reisinger says that Linux is an enigma. It's a robust operating system, it's free, it's superior to both Windows and Mac OS X on a variety of fronts, and in recent years it has become more user-friendly than ever before. It's a fantastic operating system with a slew of distributions that would satisfy any user. And yet it's not even close to capturing a significant portion of the market. But one of the operating system's most popular distributions-- Ubuntu--has the best chance of changing that. Unlike many of its alternatives, it can appeal to the average consumer with limited knowledge of the Linux environment. It's designed to be easier to use than other Linux distributions. And thanks to Dell, it's quickly gaining mass-market appeal. Thanks to Ubuntu, Linux can finally appeal to the mainstream, and in the process, become a compelling alternative for enterprise users who are tired of running in a Windows world. http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Enterprise-Applications/Is-Ubuntu-Linux-Ready-for-the-Enterprise-568056/

==== Android Apps on Ubuntu: The MID’s Return? ====

The Linux Loop asks if we remember before netbooks arrived when everyone thought MIDs would take over the world? MIDs are mobile Internet devices. They are supposed to be small computers you can carry around in your pocket, but they never really took off. Ubuntu MID edition might be able to bring them back, though. Thanks to the iPhone, the primary value of most smart phones comes from their applications. Regardless of the controversy Apple’s app store created, it certainly changed the game for mobile devices. Since then, we have learned about plans to make it possible to run Android applications on Ubuntu. This could give some new life to MIDs. Imagine if on your MID, in addition to doing whatever normal things you would do on a MID, you could run applications, preferably from different sources. For example, this would allow you to take advantage of the applications created for different phone systems, without having multiple devices. http://www.linuxloop.com/news/2009/06/27/android-apps-on-ubuntu-the-mids-return/

=== In The Blogosphere ===

==== Canonical’s Four Most Important Ubuntu Partners (So Far) ====

Of course there's Amazon with the EC2 cloud and Dell with it's variety of Ubuntu loaded computers.  Both names have helped push Ubuntu's popularity with consumers and small businesses.  Now, Canonical has moved into the IT channel by providing IT training through Bridge Education and Fast Lane.  Marc Alumbaugh of Fast Lane and the Bridge Education representatives are in discussion with Billy Cina, Canonical's training programs manager, discussing accelerating Ubuntu training.
http://www.workswithu.com/2009/06/22/canonicals-four-most-important-ubuntu-partners/

==== Should Oracle's Linux strategy be...Ubuntu? ====

Matt Asay, of CNet News, questions why Oracle continues to push its Oracle Enterprise Linux (OEL) when the figures clearly show that Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) has the majority of the customer base.  In addition Ubuntu's popularity on desktops and in enterprise environments is on the rise.  He suggests that it would be better for Oracle to reconsider and either go with Red Hat or Ubuntu.  See his reasons at:  http://news.cnet.com/8301-13505_3-10272966-16.html

==== Spreading the Ubuntu Brand Too Far? ====

Christopher Tozzi of Works With U questions the suggestion mentioned on the wiki page for the branding package[1] for adding branding to some of the applications in Ubuntu.  It's his opinion that adding Ubuntu branding to packages like Open``Office.org and GIMP would give users the wrong idea about who developed them, and could cause difficulties with the developers of those programs.  In his words, "The fact that an application runs on Ubuntu doesn’t make it part of Ubuntu, and users should be kept aware of the distinctions between the operating system and the programs it runs."
1. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/branding

Read his argument at:  http://www.workswithu.com/2009/06/23/the-problem-with-ubuntu-branding/

==== How to Track Ubuntu Deployments Worldwide ====

Works``With``U's Joe Panettieri asks "Who’s running Ubuntu — and why?" You can find the answers in Works``With``U's 1000 survey and associated research report — which will ultimately track 1000 businesses, schools, government agencies and non-profit organizations running Ubuntu servers, desktops and mobile devices. To see the the Works``With``U 1000 results so far, visit the Works``With``U 1000 center. Also, be sure to participate in the Works``With``U 1000 survey. They’ve received more than 380 survey responses to date, and they intend to march quickly toward 1,000 responses. http://www.workswithu.com/2009/06/23/how-to-track-ubuntu-deployments-worldwide/
