== CHIRP ==

CHRIP is a very useful application used to program numerous brands of radios.

The Chirp web site <nowiki>[[http://chirp.danplanet.com/projects/chirp/wiki/Home|is here]]</nowiki>

=== Recommendations ===

It is recommended for most up to date features and radio compatibility that the Chirp daily build be used
as described here:

=== Known Issues ===
==== Baufeng UV-5r ====
As reported by DARXUS:

Older versions of Chirp (pre v0.4.1-1.0) there is a bug that resulted in me not being able to
use my new radio for the week long event I purchased it for.

If you download a chirp file from a Baofeng UV-5R with an older firmware
version (such as BFS311), then upload it to a radio with a newer firmware
(such as N5R2407) with a version of chirp older than daily build 07172014,
it will not recieve audio.  Issue #2 here:

If this PPA did not exist, I would have used
https://launchpad.net/~dansmith/+archive/ubuntu/chirp-snapshots and not had
this problem.

(I used the PPA because the version in precise was too old to upload to a
UV-5R, I believe.)
