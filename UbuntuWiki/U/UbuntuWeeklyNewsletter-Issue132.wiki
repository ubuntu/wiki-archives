* Automatic backup before upgrading to new release
* Not all problems are valid
* There is no list of new packages that are waiting for acceptance

Ubuntu Brainstorm is a community site geared toward letting you add your ideas for Ubuntu. You can submit your own idea, or vote for or against another idea. http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/

=== LoCo News ===

==== LoCo Directory Moves Forward ====

In a brief posting, Jono Bacon shows off screen shots of the new Lo``Co directory. The idea was to take the information from the Lo``Co Team List, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LoCoTeamList, and gather it in a database that was easier to read and access. This is still a work in progress, but the design is coming along well. Thanks to Rich Johnson for doing the developing work, and efrain for importing the data shown in the screen shots.

==== Ubuntu Tunisia: Migration Project - National Engineering School of Sfax (ENIS) ====

The project was launched under the initiative taken by the ENIS to migrate its computing equipment to a free solutions. Our Lo``Co was contacted by the ENIS administration to contribute to this project by providing presentations on Ubuntu and free software and support them for migration. This migration was carried out in two phases. A first phase in December 2008, code name ENIS Event 8.12, and a second phase in January 2009, code name ENIS Event 9.01. The initial planning of the first phase was scheduled over two days (December 20th and 21th, 2008): a conferences day and another for assistance to the migration.

Members of the ubuntu-tn Lo``Co provided various presentations to students, teachers and ENIS technical staff (around 80 people). These presentations focused on the presentation of Ubuntu, the switching to Open``Office.org, the Ubuntu administration, programming, virtualization, security and Ubuntu server for TPE/PME. Each presentation was followed by a discussion between ubuntu-tn Lo``Co members and the audience in the amphitheater. Pictures of the event at the links.

=== New in Jaunty Jackalope ===

==== Ubuntu in the Cloud ====

Eucalyptus (Elastic Utility Computing Architecture for Linking Your Programs To Useful Systems) was placed in Jaunty before the feature freeze.  This means that a cloud infrastructure will be able to be built upon Ubuntu Server.  In addition, some Java related components have been added:
# Apache Axis2 is a Web services engine.  Both SOAP and REST style web-service are supported with binary data being exchanged via MTOM.
# The WS-Security specification is provided by the rampart package, the Apache web services security engine.

In addition, some virtualization related components were also updated, such as kvm, libvirt 0.6.0, cirt-manager 0.6.1, and opennebula.

=== Launchpad News ===

==== Inside the Launchpad Foundations Sprint ====

The Launchpad Foundations team, and some Canonical engineers have been meeting in Montreal to prepare for the release of the Launchpad code. Part of this process is to separate out the parts that are not specific to Launchpad, and place them in a new framework called LAZR. These will be libraries that can be reused in other projects. The down side is that a lot of these libraries have dependencies to Launchpad that need to be removed.  The up side is that when they get done, these libraries will be able to be used in any project that uses Zope interfaces to describe its data objects.

http://blog.launchpad.net/api/inside-the-launchpad-foundations-sprint

=== Ubuntu Forums News ===

==== Community Interview: Michael Godawski ====

Please meet Michael Godawski, http://matthewhelmke.net/2009/02/26/an-interview-with-michaelgodawski/ from Germany. He was born in Poland and studies History of Art and Sociology. Michael is the perfect example of a non-geeky member, consistently helpful with new users, always patient and kind. Like many others, his first computer encounter was with an Atari 2600. He is now a member of the Beginners Team and Unanswered Posts Team and writes tutorials you can find on his website: http://ubunturesources.ub.ohost.de Enjoy!

==== Simplifying Forums Categories ====

Over the last month, several changes have been made to rearrange the forums categories. In particular, the Other OS Talk section was merged back with the general support sub-forums, and links to the major Linux distributions or other OS support forums provided. Hopefully, we will be able to send back traffic to the other Linux projects, as Ubuntu Forums has a fast growth (current on-line user record is 35,611) and are pushing our hosting servers walls. A new [other_os] prefix has been added to help identify and search specific thread topics.

==== Mark a thread as Solved ====

We used to have a specific plug-in to add "Solved" in the thread title when needed. This plug-in (along with the "Thanks" feature) gave troubles with the database and had to be disabled. Tags can be used instead, as they are shown next to the thread title, in a different color.

==== Mail Stack Improvements in Ubuntu 9.04 ====

Up until the Ubuntu-server 9.04 (Jaunty Jackalope) release, sysadmins needed to manually set up all parts of a mail server; IMAP, POP, SMTP, SASL authentication, and TLS/SSL support for all of the services before any other custom configuration could begin. Working toward a more perfect installation process, the Ubuntu Server team has come to the conclusion that there needed to be an integrated mail stack with a safe default set up. The new Dovecot-Postfix install will enable the default install of a working e-mail server out of the box. Not all mail configuration problems are solved with the default install, as set up for antispam and antivirus countermeasures must be setup separately.

==== Ubuntu Encrypted home with 2 factor authentication ====

There are ways to keep your encrypted home folder safe, defeating the casual hack of using a LiveCD to access the average setup. The methods of securing this data are discussed as to limiting physical access to the pass-phrase file through removable media, by using two-factor authentication. Then you just need to ensure that you protect that device! Pop it out, if you're leaving your system alone, and keep that device on your person. You can read Dustin's advice on encrypted directories by using the links below.

==== Ubuntu Drupal Team: Planet module ====

Introducing the Drupal Planet module, which allows Drupal users to add specific feeds instead creating a whole new site, the Drupal Planet module places feeds under the /planet directory. Users have the ability to add as many feeds as desired, where the feeds are updated automatically using cron. This makes feed aggregation possible now by using a single module.

http://profarius.com/content/planet-module-drupal

==== Introducing Tarmac ====

Announcing the release of Tarmac, the robotic landing bot for Launchpad. The idea is simple. You have a development focus branch that constantly needs to have branches landed on it, but you're too busy writing your own code to manually land them in trunk. Tarmac takes the difficulty out of this by checking your development focus branch for approved merge proposals, and merging them automatically. This first release is just a little more than "the simplest thing that could possibly work." Feature requests and patches are most certainly welcome.

=== In The Press ===

==== Has Ubuntu hit a plateau? ====

Adrian Kingsley-Hughes of ZD``Net wonders, has Ubuntu hit a plateau? After he downloaded the alpha 5 release of the upcoming Ubuntu 9.04, what surprised him was he felt that there was very little for him to get excited about. In fact, even the just announced 9.10 release which is over six months away, has nothing that really gets his blood moving. Adrian states, "Don’t get me wrong, I like Ubuntu. Of all the Linux distros that I’ve tried, it’s the one that seems to show the most promise of being able to go mainstream. It’s fast, reliable and secure." He goes on to question the need for the six month release schedule because in his opinion, these releases are feeling more and more like service packs than evolutionary steps forward. http://blogs.zdnet.com/hardware/?p=3669&tag=nl.e589

==== Ubuntu's "plateau" = Good news for education ====

Christopher Dawson of ZD``Net responds to Adrian Kingsley-Hughes' article summarized above. Dawson wants to know why it's such a bad thing that the six month release schedule has turned into more of a service pack. "What this means is that Ubuntu has reached an incredible state of maturity and schools can now use it without fear of obsolescence in 6 months. It also means that incremental updates are easily applied without significant disruption to labs or servers, while allowing users to take advantage of new features." While the geek in him is always looking for something new, improved, and uber-cool, the IT admin. in him just wants something that works well and consistently. http://education.zdnet.com/?p=2207

==== Linux Desktop heads for the clouds ====

Matt Asay of Cnet News thinks that while evangelists of Linux distributions built for personal computers point to Netbooks as an indication of renewed life in their chances to compete for consumers, new data suggests that this may be a fool's hope. Instead, such advocates would do well to follow the leads of Canonical and Red Hat, as they respectively extend the desktop with cloud services, and deliver desktop functionality from the cloud. Canonical's Mark Shuttleworth told Asay last year that his Ubuntu desktop strategy would increasingly include cloud services. Recently, Canonical started to deliver on this vision. The point isn't to replicate the Windows desktop. The point is to completely change the way desktops are delivered, and their services used. Anyone still worried about Linux on Netbooks is fighting the wrong battle. http://news.cnet.com/8301-13505_3-10189098-16.html

==== Ubuntu vs Windows: Memory and a backup solution ====

Martin compares Windows 7, Windows Vista, and Ubuntu RAM usage; backs up the whole machine with Acronis; and finds some things Ubuntu does well, and others that he can't seem to get working. At startup, Windows 7 for x64 had a memory footprint of 1.24GB, with the Windows Vista for x64 memory having a memory footprint of 1.34GB. On the same machine, Ubuntu 8.10 had a memory footprint of 349 MB of RAM. In other words, a whole gigabyte less than Vista. Heller goes on to discuss using Acronis to back it up, and what features work well for him in Ubuntu. http://weblog.infoworld.com/stratdev/archives/2009/03/ubuntu_vs_windo.html

==== Acer Aspire One with Moblin 2, Ubuntu 8.10 ====

Jordan Spencer Cunningham of OSnews reviews Ubuntu 8.10 (Intrepid Ibex) on his Acer Aspire One. Jordan found that startup is basically as fast as Windows XP, and Windows 7. Everything seems to work out of the box except for the wireless, camera, and microphone. The overall system works flawlessly, and seemingly as fast as Windows 7, even in full-graphics mode. He did have some problems with unplugging or plugging the AC power causing the system’s power manager to halt. Overall, he gives the Ubuntu 8.10 system on the Acer Aspire One a 7/10. Aside from some very minor bugs, it is a very netbooker-friendly system. If the wireless was included naturally in the distribution without having to do any serious tweaking, Ubuntu would be as ready, if not more so than Windows 7 to be a netbook system. http://www.osnews.com/story/21070/Review_Acer_Aspire_One_with_Moblin_2_Ubuntu_8_10_Windows/page4/

==== Taking Ubuntu 9.04 Out For A Spin ====

Wanting to get a taste of what to expect come April, Jeremy La``Croix of IT News Today takes a look at the upcoming version of Ubuntu, code named “Jaunty Jackalope.” After running into a few bugs on a daily build of Jaunty, La``Croix switched to Jaunty Alpha 5 for the install. Once the installation was complete, he was presented with the GDM log in screen, which was sporting a brand new theme, that he thinks looks awesome. La``Croix notes the new notification system, but the best thing he noticed about Ubuntu 9.04 so far, is how fast it is. "The developers weren’t lying when they talked about speed, this thing is FAST." Even though he installed it on an older machine, he says you wouldn’t notice it because even with an older processor, Jaunty is probably the most responsive version he has ever used. http://www.itnewstoday.com/?p=215

==== My Experiences With Ubuntu 9.04 So Far ====

Blogger Jerremy La``Croix from IT News Today gives us a preview of Kubunutu 9.04 Jaunty Jackalope. He makes sure that everyone knows before hand that this it is still in development, so a full review would not be fair or accurate. He will write a full review of the release once it comes out in April. He didn't say anything about the installation process, because he didn't see much change in it. He did comment on how stable and fast jaunty is, even though it's still in development. He continues by saying that "it's very abnormal to have this much stability in the operating system at this point in its development." He was happy that there was a new network manager, so that there was one less legacy KDE3 application being used. He is having difficulty connecting to a network, but contributes this to the release still being in development. We are also informed of K``Package``Kit which is the new package manager that KDE4 is using. Adept is also installed by default, so you can pick which one you want to use. He describes the KDE4 install as "yet another vanilla KDE 4 installation." This is because the theme is still the same, and even the desktop is still the same as previous releases. In conclusion he says that the speed increase alone is enough to warrant upgrading to 9.04. http://www.itnewstoday.com/?p=198

==== Hive Five: Best Home Server Software ====

Blogger Jason Fitzpatrick from Life Hacker goes over what people voted as the top 5 pieces of software that people use to power their home servers. In the top 5 were: Free``Nas, Ubuntu Server Edition, Apache, Debian, and Windows Home Server. He talks about the capabilities of all 5 of these pieces of software, and what benefits that they give to the user. For Ubuntu Server Edition, he covered the ease of use of it. He liked the automated LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP) installation. This is because it's much easier to install the core components of a server this way, than to have to configure each component on your own. He then tells us about the abundance of applications that make integration with the rest of your home network easier. He says that "Ubuntu is more than powerful and capable enough to handle all your media streaming, remote back up, and file serving needs." http://lifehacker.com/5162026/best-home-server-software

==== Memo to Mark Shuttleworth: Don’t Settle for Ubuntu Linux Desktops ====

Joe Panettieri of Works With U wants to let Mark Shuttleworth know where he believes Ubuntu should be concentrating its efforts. He strongly agrees with continuing to push Ubuntu Server Edition, and not relying on just Ubuntu Desktop Edition. This is because he believes that companies that only have one "cash cow" die. He doesn't like the logic behind pulling back from the server market, and pushing harder in the Desktop market. He points out that a lesson is to be learned from Windows NT, and when it first came out for the server market. In conclusion he says that the server efforts shouldn't slow down, they should be accelerated, while holding ground in the Desktop market. http://www.workswithu.com/2009/03/03/memo-to-mark-shuttleworth-dont-settle-for-ubuntu-linux-desktops/

==== Ubuntu Directory Service: Canonical Calls for Help ====

Joe Panettieri of Works``With``U reports that Canonical is developing a Directory Services strategy that could help Ubuntu Server Edition compete, and integrate more effectively with Microsoft, Windows Server and Active Directory. In addition to a relationship with Likewise Software, Canonical is seeking external experts to help accelerate some Directory Services efforts. According to Nick Barcet, Canonical’s Ubuntu Server product manager, “Open``LDAP is our LDAP implementation of choice in Ubuntu Server Edition. Around it we are putting together the base configuration and tools that we need to offer a better “out of the box” experience. In 8.10 we implemented a method for schema update to be automatically replicated to multiple Open``LDAP instances in the network. 9.04 should implement the basis of certificate management as well as a saner default DIT.” Barcet concedes Canonical is juggling multiple priorities at the moment — which means a full-blown directory service isn’t a top priority at the company. However,  while this is not the top priority, it is something they are very conscious about, and progress is only limited by the resources they have. If some readers would have some spare time to help in that direction, they would be more than welcome. http://www.workswithu.com/2009/03/05/ubuntu-directory-service-canonical-calls-for-help/

==== TurnKey: 12 new Ubuntu-based server appliances released ====

To those unfamiliar with Turn``Key Linux, it's an easy way to get a pre-integrated Ubuntu system up and running on your server or VM (VMware, Virtual``Box, Xen, KVM) of choice, and in just a couple of minutes. The project recently announced its most exciting and ambitious batch of releases yet. The 2009.02 release, based on Ubuntu 8.04.2 LTS, features extensive improvements to usability, security and stability: http://www.turnkeylinux.org/news

Since its last appearance in the UWN, the project has added 9 new appliances to its family, which now includes LAMP stack, Ruby on Rails, Media``Wiki, Joomla, Drupal, LAPP stack, Django stack, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Turn``Key Core (102MB) and Bootstrap (67MB): http://www.turnkeylinux.org/appliances

According to the project's developers "next up are appliances for Apache Tomcat, Wordpress, Moodle, Movable Type and phpBB." The project has only gotten this far thanks to the warm reception it received from the Ubuntu community when they were just starting out. Thanks to everyone who tried the appliances, gave them feedback, and got involved!"

=== Meeting Summaries ===

==== Technical Board Meeting ====

Attendees: Matt Zimmerman (chair), Mark Shuttleworth, Colin Watson, and Scott James Remnant

* Should technical-board@lists.ubuntu.com be public?

** Technical-board@ serves two purposes:
1. a contact address to reach the TB (and only the TB)
2. a mailing list to discuss TB matters
   for 1., a private list is appropriate, but for 2., it is not.

** Currently, the Technical Board is responsible for the following
   documents and processes:
1. The Ubuntu Package Policy,
2. Ubuntu Release Feature Goals,
3. Ubuntu Package Selection,
   none of that stuff should be private, however there needs to be a
   quick, easy and memorable way to talk privately to or among the TB.

** No objections to subscribing select people to the TB list who are
   also participating but not actually on the TB.  It was also
   reaffirmed that where possible, we should shift discussion of public
   matters from t-b@ onto ubuntu-devel@

   The TB will stay private so long as we only use it for discussions
   which ought to be private, and nothing else e.g. if someone emails
   technical-board@ and raises a technical concern, we must redirect
   that to ubuntu-devel@.

* MOTU Council list of nominees for MOTU Council Election

** Appointments to the board are made by Mark Shuttleworth subject to
   confirmation by a vote amongst the maintainers

** The CC (and TB) will determine a shortlist of candidates and set up
   Launchpad polls accordingly so team members can vote.

** The polls might take the form of confirmation votes or of a race
   between more candidates than the available seats on the Team Council.
   MC has been well organized, growing it gives an opportunity to
   develop more leadership talent so 2 other seats will be added.

** The three nominees are: Daniel Holbach, Nathan Handler, and Jonathan
   Davies

ACTION: sabdfl to set up Launchpad polls including per-package uploaders
for MC nominee confirmations

* SRU guidelines for Landscape

** https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LandscapeUpdates

** Sometimes, the Landscape client code must be updated to take
   advantage of improvements/updates to the Landscape server...and this
   is their reasoning for the need to be part of an SRU.

** The reasons why Landscape is suitable, given the negotiations to
   date, are:
   - it has an extensive test suite (yes, like other packages in the
     archive)
   - its developers have committed to doing specific QA on a variety of
     upgrade and fresh-install combinations
   - it has very limited interactions with the rest of Ubuntu, that are
     straightforward to enumerate so that we can have a clear idea of
     regression potential
   - those interactions have been specifically called out in the
     mandatory QA process that each upgrade must go through
   - its developers have agreed to work within the Ubuntu update
     process

** Landscape developers originally raised: https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/landscape-client/+bug/306360

** We want assurance that the potential impact is limited, and that the
   testing conducted is sufficient to provide the level of assurance we
   expect for stable updates.

** We've entrusted the SRU team to assess the QA aspect and will review
   that ourselves as well based on the document that outlines the
   criteria we used to make the decision and includes the sentence ("the
   TB will consider additional applications in due course following
   similar criteria")

ACTION: cjwatson to write up a formal decision which the TB can then
vote on

* Upload permission for Romain Francoise for emacs-snapshot

** https://edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/emacs-snapshot
