==== Call for testing: Juju and gccgo ====

James Page informs us that an objective for 14.04 is to have a single toolchain for Go in Juju and the only way that this can be done is to use gccgo instead of golang-go. James shows us how to switch between the golang gc built binaries and the gccgo built versions to make diagnosing gccgo specific issues easier.

==== Jonathan Riddell: Tier 1 is a Slam Dunk ====

Jonathan Riddell writes "KDE Frameworks 5 tech preview shipped last week and we've been packaging furiously. This is all new packaging from scratch, none of our automated scripts we have for KDE SC. Tier 1 is in our experimental PPA for Trusty. Special thanks to Scarlett our newest Kubuntu Ninja who is doing a stormer." Jonathan links to the KDE Frameworks 5 web page and to the experimental PPA where the packages can be found.

==== Benjamin Kerensa: Thoughts on Ubuntu Touch Images ====

Benjamin Kerensa responds to the announcement that Canonical will cease to produce Ubuntu Touch images for certain Nexus devices in the near future. He suggests that instead of producing a set number of images for a select few devices, Canonical could instead choose to simply update its instructions on building images for any device, leaving it up to developers to produce images for their device(s).

Joey-Elijah Sneddon of OMG!
