== Proper name for this project ==

I'm pretty sure we can all agree that "Ubuntu Easy Business Server" is not the catchiest project name in the world. Hence, I'd like to get some suggestions on a good name for the project. Please add your suggestions and your name to the list below. You have until this Friday April 20th) at noon UTC to add your suggestions. Soon after the deadline, I'll look over the list and decide on a winner. The submitter of the winning entry will be awarded eternal fame and glory, a free Ubuntu CD courtesy of http://shipit.ubuntu.com , and a beer if I ever run into you IRL.

| Ubuntu Marketplace
| timothylord
| I like the wide-open implications of the word "marketplace" -- covers everything from craftsmen in a plaza to international trade. Markets are (or should be) free and friendly.
|-
| Ubuntu TradeFair
| timothylord
| Trade fairs are one of the things that brought us into the modern era, or that the modern era allowed to flourish. Both, really. It's nice, too, that both "trade" and "fair" are loaded with applicable positive meanings. ("Fair" can mean here equitable and just, or a dynamic gathering; "Trade" can mean commerce generally, or intentionally equal exchanges more specifically.)
|-
| Ubuntu Dynamo
| timothylord
| "Dynamo" as an analogy; markets are the engine of the world.
