=== Welcome to the Ubuntu Nashik wiki page !!! ===

'''Ubuntu Nashik''' is a group of students who advocate / spread and promote Ubuntu and free software in Nashik city. We plan events in the city in colleges, schools and wherever possible. We act as the face of Ubuntu Community in Nashik. The group is open to everybody in the city with an interest in spreading and discussing '''Ubuntu'''.
