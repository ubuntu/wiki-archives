== Description ==
Creating a game with the name Ubuntu World which takes the player on a trip all around the world as globe trotter. Financially the player will have to take jobs (questions and possibly some interactive task for each job) to save the money needed to continue on the travel, the possibillity of working for a magazine (taking pictures and things like that) could also be an option.

Not much is decided yet and it's continuation is depending on if anyone is interested.

Please let me know if there is something you want to know.
