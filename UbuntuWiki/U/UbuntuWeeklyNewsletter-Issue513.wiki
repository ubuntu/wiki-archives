Adam Conrad on behalf on the Ubuntu Release Team reminds us that Ubuntu 16.10, which was officially released on October 13, 2016, is a non-LTS release and as such its support period will cease on July 20. Adam notes that anyone still using Yakkety Yak 16.10 should upgrade to 17.04 soon to continue receiving security updates, with attached links provided for 17.04 release notes on upgrading.

==== Nobuto Murata: Knowing what services need restart with "needrestart" ====

With the release of Canonical’s Livepatch service for Ubuntu 16.04 and 14.04, it has become easier to apply security and kernel updates without entirely rebooting the system. However, there are some caveats to this service. Nobuto Murata expands on this by quoting the useful “lsof” function, and talks about the helper script “needrestart” which among others, provides a prompt during service restarts.

==== Didier Roche: Ubuntu Make as a classic snap: intro ====

Didier Roche writes about Ubuntu Make, and congratulates Galileo for becoming a core committer. Due to bottlenecks with the Debian-Ubuntu pipeline, Didier is telling us how Ubuntu Make has been made into a Snap to see what converting a complex project is like.

==== Brian Murray: Using the Ubuntu Error Tracker for SRUs ====

Brian Murray of Canonical tells us what a great tool the Ubuntu Error Tracker is for recording information useful for resolving crashes. Using a number of examples, Brian gives examples where it was both easy and required more work, but still make Error Tracker useful in squashing bugs.

==== Carla Seller: My first Snap. ====

Carla Seller tells us that she has been testing Ubuntu for some time, and decided to try something new. Though not a developer, Carla blogs about how she went about learning about Snaps, including speaking to devs on Rocket Chat, and using her knowledge to create a snap.
