==== Ubuntu in 2013 ====

Mark Shuttleworth shares his thoughts about Ubuntu in 2013 with following: “It’s important to me, and to the wider Ubuntu community, the people be able to derive some benefit from our efforts. We know that there are plenty of smart people whos needs are well served by what existed in the past. We continue to maintain older versions of Ubuntu so that they can enjoy those tools on a stable platform. But we want to shape the future, which means exploring territory that is unfamiliar, uncertain and easy to criticise. That’s why Unity in 2013 will be all about mobile – bringing Ubuntu to phones and tablets.”
