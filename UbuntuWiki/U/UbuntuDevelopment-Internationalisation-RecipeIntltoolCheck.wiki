== Checking out the translations of intltool-based packages ==

If you want to make sure that your packages translations are set up correctly, try running:

* For GNOME packages:
{{{
cd po; intltool-update -m}}}

Note: ''this is only worth trying if the package uses intltool for i18n (i.e. look for intltool.m4 in the top-level source directory)''

Sometimes empty `.po` files caused packages to fail to build from source.
