== Checking out the translations of intltool-based packages ==

If you want to make sure that your packages translations are set up correctly, try running:

* For GNOME packages:
<pre>
cd po; intltool-update -m</pre>
and be sure to either fix the issues or report them upstream.

Note: ''this is only worth trying if the package uses intltool for i18n (i.e. look for intltool.m4 in the top-level source directory)''

* For GNU packages:

* For KDE packages:

Sometimes empty `.po` files caused packages to fail to build from source.
