==== Important notice regarding Java packages in Partner archive ====

Due to a change in the Oracle Sun Java JDK packages license, many companies no longer have permission to distribute Oracle JDK.

Marc Deslauriers of the Ubuntu Security Team writes in his email to the Ubuntu Security Announce mailing lists, “Due to the severity of the security risk, Canonical is immediately releasing a security update for the Sun JDK browser plugin which will disable the plugin on all machines. This will mitigate users' risk from malicious websites exploiting the vulnerable version of the Sun JDK.”

For more information and details for how to continue using Java on Ubuntu please see the links below.
