__TOC__

Shouldn't Ubuntu Server have support for NUT in the main repository? This is core server stuff, especially for small and medium size business which don't have power backup for a whole building.

seconded: Arnaud Quette (NUT Project Leader)
 as a side note, I'm working on HAL support for UPSs through NUT.
 This will mostly benefit to Gnome and KDE users, but I'll think about a console backend.
 The HAL code is available in <nowiki>[[http://www.networkupstools.org/source.html|NUT 2.1]]</nowiki>
