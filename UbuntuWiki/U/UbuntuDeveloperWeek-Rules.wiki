== Ubuntu Developer Week Rules ==

Please observe these rules when in a tutorial session:
* Try to get to the session on time.
* Do NOT speak while the host is doing the tutorial part of the session. Talking happens in `#ubuntu-classroom-chat` on `irc.freenode.net`

=== Asking Questions ===

When the Q+A part of the session opens, please do the following to ask a question:
* Log into `#ubuntu-classroom-chat`  on `irc.freenode.net`
* Ask your question and prefix it with '''QUESTION:''' (e.g. "QUESTION: How do I do foo?")
* Wait patiently for your answer in `#ubuntu-classroom`  on `irc.freenode.net`

If you have any problems or questions about the Ubuntu Developer Week, ask in `#ubuntu-classroom-chat` on `irc.freenode.net`.

Thanks for abiding by these rules - this will help us keep the sessions on track and as productive as possible. :)
