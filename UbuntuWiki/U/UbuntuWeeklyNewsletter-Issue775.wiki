==== There's no place like... KDE: Plasma 5.27 is out and GNOME 44 hits beta ====

Liam Proven writes about KDE Plasma 5.27 and GNOME 44. We're firstly told about KDE Plasma 5.27, which is the last of the Qt5 based KDE Plasma releases, which is a LTS release. We are told of some of the "shiny new" features within it, and given a link to the full changelog should we need more. Next Liam discusses GNOME 44 which we'll see in Ubuntu 23.04 and Fedora 38, discussing some of the changes that are expected when it's released in April 2023.

=== In the Blogosphere ===

==== KDE Frameworks 5.103 Improves Support for Flatpak and Qt 6 Apps, Plasma Wayland ====

Marius Nestor writes about KDE Project's release of KDE Frameworks 5.103. We are told of some bugs that are fixed, including one major issue, as well as some fixes that were impacting Plasma Wayland. We are reminded of Qt6 being the future, and given a link to the full changelog for this release.

==== Expandable Folder View Returns to Nautilus in Ubuntu 23.04 ====

Joey Sneddon writes that a new version of Nautilus can be found on Ubuntu 23.04 daily builds. We are told of a new opt-in behavior that can allow us to find files faster in list view. We are reminded that work continues on GNOME 44, which includes a new "icon view in the GTK file picker" which we can see in current dailies. Joey expresses the view that "the bulk of GNOME 44 should be present in Lunar by the time Ubuntu 23.04 Beta rolls out".

==== KDE Plasma 5.27 Released - Better Wayland Support, KWin Tiling, Multi-Monitor Overhaul ====

Michael Larabel tells us about the KDE Plasma 5.27 release from KDE developers. We are told this is a LTS release, "features a new welcome wizard", as well as many other new improvements and fixes. The release will be appreciated especially by Wayland users, and includes a link to the full KDE.org release announcement.

==== You may want to run system updates, after a recent sudo security flaw ====

Liam Dawe writes about his learning of a flaw in the sudo package, giving us some details of it and the version with the required fix. Readers of Ubuntu should also note Alan Pope's response and provision of Ubuntu's relevant CVE-2023-22809 link that shows the correct version of the package for each supported release of Ubuntu with the enclosed fix.

==== Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Is Now Powered by Linux Kernel 5.19 from Ubuntu 22.10 ====

Marius Nestor reminds us that Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS release is almost upon us, and thus Ubuntu 22.04 LTS users using the HWE kernel stack have upgraded to the 5.19 kernel from Ubuntu 22.10. We are reminded of some of the new features included in the 5.19 kernel, with an opinion given from Marius that if those new features are not required, he recommends staying with the 5.15 LTS kernel provided in the GA kernel stack (which has the option of using the real-time kernel). We are reminded that Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS release is scheduled for 23 February 2023.
