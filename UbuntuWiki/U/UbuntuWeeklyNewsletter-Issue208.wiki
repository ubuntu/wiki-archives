==== 11.04 Ubuntu Developer Summit Announced ====

Hot on the heels of the announcement of the Natty Narwhal, I am tickled pink to announce the details of the next Ubuntu Developer Summit taking place in Orlando, USA from 25th – 29th October 2010. We also have a brand new Ubuntu Developer Summit website which provides all the details about how to get there and why UDS is interesting if you are in our community, if you are an upstream, and if you are a vendor.

The Ubuntu Developer Summit one of the most important events in the Ubuntu calendar and at it we discuss, debate and design the next version of Ubuntu. We bring together the entire Canonical development team and sponsor a large number of community members across the wide range of areas in which people contribute to Ubuntu. This includes packaging, translations, documentation, testing, Lo``Co teams and more. UDS is an incredible experience, filled with smart and enthusiastic people, fast paced and exhausting, but incredibly gratifying to be part of the process that builds the next Ubuntu.

For every UDS, Canonical sponsors a number of community members to attend the event. We are looking for those who want to bring some real insight and expertise in their area of Ubuntu, be it development or community governance. If you feel you could offer this but can’t afford to cover your expenses of attending, you should apply for sponsorship. The deadline for sponsorship is 8th September 2010.

==== Getting More Developers Interested In Participating In Ubuntu ====

I am just beginning to get into the planning stages for the next cycle for my team, and as part of this cycle we would like to really focus on attracting more developers to participate in Ubuntu. We would like to see more people interested in getting involved in packaging, fixing bugs, and joining our community. Daniel Holbach on my team will be leading much of this work.

Right now the 11.04 planning slate is clean, and we are looking for what you all feel are the areas in which Daniel’s time and effort would be best spent in the interests of having more people participate.

Where do you think we should focus our efforts?

=== LoCo News ===

==== Maverick Meerkat Release Parties ====

Not long left till Maverick Meerkat aka 10.10 is released with that in  mind it’s time for loco teams to start to plan for their release party.  I’ve added the global event to the Lo``Co Directory Maverick Meerkat is scheduled for  release on the 10th of the 10th 2010. To celebrate 10.10 Lo``Co teams have  organised parties to celebrate these events.

Release parties are a great way to celebrate, meet new friends and often introduce new people to Ubuntu and to our local communities. Release parties are not only great way to meet people but also they are a lot of  fun.  Please add your event to the Lo``Co Directory.

To find out more information on how you can plan a release party go to:

==== Ubuntu LAN Party at Kwartzlab was a lot of fun! ====

Kwartzlab got a new type of event which has been beta tested early this month: The Ubuntu LAN Party! Eric organised this first event, which remained solely within the realms of kwatzlab and gave the kwartlab members the privilege to attend this premiere.

http://blog.txwikinger.me.uk/content/ubuntu-lan-party-kwartzlab-was-lot-fun

==== First Debian/Ubuntu Community Conference in Italy ====

Paolo Sammicheli announces - The Italian Mini-Debconf and the Ubuntu-it meeting will be held together, in an collaborative community conference called DUCC-IT 2010. It will be held in Perugia on Saturday 18 September, contemporary celebrating the Software Freedom Day 2010. A warm-up hacknight and a key-signing party have been organized for Friday and Sunday (17th-19th Sept) on a local Hacklab. Current Debian Project Leader Stefano Zacchiroli has already confirmed his presence with a keynote.

==== Michigan LoCo Jam – Another Success! ====

Greg Grossmeier writes -  Another Ubuntu Global Jam means another Michigan Lo``Co success. Greg also notes, I think we hit every single proposed topic during the Jam. We talked about how to use the Ubuntu area of Stack``Exchange and even had a few members post answers and gain some reputation points. We did some ISO testing (and ran up against bug 608382). We reported some bugs (bug 625989 and bug 626003). And we even played with some new toys (Gib’s 16 megapixel(?!) $10(?!) digital video camera).

==== New Maine LoCo website ====

==== Operation: Wiki De-Kruft ====

Paul Tagliamonte describes Wiki De-Kruft.  So begins Operation Wiki De-Kruft
We’ll ( Lo``Co Teams / Lo``Co Council ) be working on a new project ( which I’d like to call ‘Operation: Wiki-Dekruft’ in a hopeless effort to make it sound like something fun ) to ensure the Wiki is up-to-date.

There’s a lot out there, and we’re migrating over to the Lo``Co Directory, just in case you’ve not figured that out yet. If ya’ll could run through the wiki and find all the pages that are out of date, unused or just plain useless and add the Category “Category``Lo``Co``Obsolete” to it, you will stop seeing my posts about it.

Now there’s incentive!

We’ll blast through this list later on ( once LD is feature complete ) and blow away the pages ( note the action words ) that don’t need to exist anymore ( read: lists that are duplicated elsewhere, events, blah blah blah ).

==== Jono Bacon: Articulating IRC Contributions Concisely ====

Jono has started a discussion on his blog regarding the current inability of being able to accurately assess a person's contributions through IRC Channels. The methods used to assess contributions in the Ubuntu Forums and Ubuntu Stack Exchange are not present in IRC. Follow Jono as he explores some ideas to accurately asses IRC contributions:

http://www.jonobacon.org/2010/08/24/articulating-irc-contributions-concisely/

==== Jono Bacon: Rocking The Application Indicators ====

Some time back the Ayatana project introduced the Application Indicator Framework, based upon technology created by the KDE project. We have been shipping this technology in Ubuntu for a few releases now and it makes the top-right part of the desktop a smooth, efficient, and pleasant experience, getting over the inconsistent and limiting notification area we had before.

To find out more about The Application Indicators go to:

http://www.jonobacon.org/2010/08/25/rocking-the-application-indicators/

==== Canonical Design Team: This week in design – 27 August 2010 ====

This week we caught a chill in the form of our UI Freeze. That meant that from here on we should only be fixing bugs in the next release of Ubuntu.
A highlight of the design contributions this week was the wonderful user contributed wallpapers!

==== Amber Graner: Interview with Ubuntu IRC Council Member – Jussi Schultink ====

In this audio interview Amber talks to Ubuntu IRC Council Member, Jussi Schultink.  Jussi is an active Ubuntu Member as well as and Ubuntu IRC Council Member. Thank you Jussi I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me and share your thoughts on being an IRC Council member and more.

==== Canonical Design Team: Boo-yah!!! ====

Back in Karmic, we had managed to fix 76 papercut bugs before final release.
During the Lucid cycle, we fixed another 102 bugs before final release.
Now in Maverick, 105 bugs have been beaten into submission already!  This is the first time, in the three editions, we have managed to make a hundred changes well before User-Interface Freeze!
A huge thank-you to all the eager patch-makers, amazing upstreams and stealth uploaders for getting us this far!
We are not done yet! No! We still have time to fix more bugs for Maverick. Can we make up for Karmic? Can we get to 300?
Often folks are baffled while looking for ways to start contributing to Ubuntu. Papercut bugs are a quick-n-easy way to get your feet wet in Ubuntu development.

==== Mackenzie Morgan: What are the barriers to walking the MOTU/Developer path? ====

I asked this on Ubuntu.Stack``Exchange but only got 3 answers so far, so I wanted to put this a bit more publicly too. What keeps you from packaging, patching, etc? If you do those things, what keeps you from applying for upload rights?

About 150 people are members of lp:~ubuntu-dev right now. There are also a handful of people who haven't yet become MOTU or joined another developer team but do good work. More hands are always needed, so what's keeping the rest of you folks away from this area of contribution?

For reference, 150 is a pretty small number given about 30,000 packages. Debian has more like 1000 developers.

=== In The Blogosphere ===

==== Keep the "Linux" out of it Please ====

Jeff Hoogland looks at why Android and Ubuntu share such large success as Linux-based operating systems. He posits that this is partially because neither mentions Linux in its advertising. He wants to know if others agree and if this is a sign of problems with Linux as a brand.

==== Rethinking Canonical’s Ubuntu Business Strategy ====

Christopher Tozzi of Works``With``U writes about the changes of Canonical's business strategy since 2007/2008. He focuses on how they've branched out from just being concerned about the desktop and server editions to how now they also have other incentives for people using Ubuntu. This ranges from things like Unity and Ubuntu Light to Ubuntu One, Launchpad, and their work on cloud computing.

==== Back to School with Ubuntu ====

Joe Panettieri of Works``With``U talks about the Za``Reason back-to-school specials for computers preinstalled with Ubuntu. He thinks these are important and wonders how Canonical and Ubuntu OEMS can work to better promote such specials so that more people are aware of them outside of the existing community.

==== Open textbooks to the rescue ====

Mark Horner is a Fellow at the Shuttleworth Foundation. Mark’s specialty is open content for education: figuring out how to produce textbooks collaboratively. He’s done amazing work in the past, independently, leading an initiative to produce free high school science textbooks, and has lead the acquisition of a full set of textbooks in SA and their publication under an open content licence by the Foundation. Today, he’s been presented with a really awesome opportunity: provide open content to all of SA, with full backing from the department of education. He needs help, though, to make sure the current drafts of the Maths and Science textbooks are free of typos.

==== Canonical: The cloud shift is developer-led ====

Jack Clark, ZDNet UK  - The cloud is expanding, with more services coming online from established providers and new entrants. But each time a major player such as Amazon Web Services or Rackspace is marked out for its potential to expand its cloud portfolio, it raises the question of how open the marketplace will be for customers if a handful of big providers end up dominating the industry.

[Neil] Levine [of Canonical] spoke to ZDNet UK to discuss the role open source has to play in keeping the barriers down for companies providing services within the cloud, and how the move to enterprise cloud computing is developer-led.
