== Ubuntu Youth - Introduction ==
'''Welcome to the Ubuntu Youth project!''' 
We are a team of youths who want to use Ubuntu and continue using it. We prove you dont need to be super nerdy to run Linux/ Ubuntu, It just takes dedication! Ubuntu Youth is the best youth-based team on Ubuntu! This is because this is the only youth based team here. Use the links at the top to navigate around our pages/wiki.

This team works towards guiding young Ubuntu Users concerning their efforts and contributions to the Ubuntu Community. The main focus areas of this team are based in four main areas, the two main wikis, system documentation, and the Ubuntu Forums:

<nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/|Ubuntu Forums]]</nowiki> - The Ubuntu Forums are pretty much just that, a website that is the official support forums for the Ubuntu/Linux Distro.
<<BR>>
<nowiki>[[http://wiki.ubuntu.com/|Ubuntu Team Wiki]]</nowiki> - This wiki is now used for organizational work, proposals and all materials not belonging to main wiki.
<<BR>>
<nowiki>[[DocumentationTeam-SystemDocumentation|System Documentation]]</nowiki> - This is the documentation that comes with Ubuntu, information on it can be found at the link. It's no more involved than doing work on the wiki, don't let the name scare you.
<<BR>>
<nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community|Help.Ubuntu/Community]]</nowiki> - The main community wiki for help documents for Ubuntu.
Please see New Users section for a list of resources and steps to getting started.
