==== Lubuntu is Linux for those looking to simplify and speed up their desktop experience ====

Jack Wallen writes about the LXQt desktop and Lubuntu. After a brief discussion of the LXQt desktop and its package manager Jack speaks of the noticed speed of the system, with the note that it isn't a stripped down system needed to achieve that speed. Next mentioned are some of features that are missed, and a dislike of the way LXQt provides theming, before the summary as a "no-frills, user-friendly operating system" for older hardware or those wanting a really fast OS.
