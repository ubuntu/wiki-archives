==== Topics for discussion ====
* Change email from rhoit’s server to dooray.com
*** As rhoit’s mail server: Using it with mail client is ok, But the roundcube webmail still has session consistency problems. It still logged out in a few secs right after logging in.
*** Suggesting to migrate to dooray.com - Not good as Google Workspace, But provides decent services for free(up to 25 users). Ubuntu Korean LoCo has been using it for 6+ months and had no problem.
