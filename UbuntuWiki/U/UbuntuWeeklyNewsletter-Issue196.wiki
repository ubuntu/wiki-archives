==== Maverick Alpha 1 released ====

Pre-releases of Maverick are *not* encouraged for anyone needing a stable system or anyone who is not comfortable running into occasional, even frequent breakage. They are, however, recommended for Ubuntu developers and those who want to help in testing, reporting, and fixing bugs.

Alpha 1 is the first in a series of milestone CD images that will be released throughout the Maverick development cycle. The Alpha images are known to be reasonably free of showstopper CD build or installer bugs, while representing a very recent snapshot of Maverick. You can download it here:

http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/maverick/alpha-1/ (Ubuntu)

http://uec-images.ubuntu.com/releases/maverick/alpha-1/ (Ubuntu Server for UEC and EC2)

http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/releases/maverick/alpha-1/ (Kubuntu)

http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/xubuntu/releases/maverick/alpha-1/ (Xubuntu)

http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntustudio/releases/maverick/alpha-1/ (Ubuntu Studio)

See http://wiki.ubuntu.com/Mirrors for a list of mirrors.

Alpha 1 includes a number of software updates that are ready for wider testing. Please refer to http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/maverick/alpha1 for information on changes in Ubuntu.

This is quite an early set of images, so you should expect some bugs. For a list of known bugs (that you don't need to report if you encounter), please see:

http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/maverick/alpha1

If you're interested in following the changes as we further develop Maverick, have a look at the maverick-changes mailing list:

http://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/maverick-changes

We also suggest that you subscribe to the ubuntu-devel-announce list if you're interested in following Ubuntu development. This is a low-traffic list (a few posts a week) carrying announcements of approved specifications, policy changes, alpha releases, and other interesting events.

http://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-devel-announce

Bug reports should go to the Ubuntu bug tracker:

https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ReportingBugs

To see the original Ubuntu 10.10 Alpha 1 announcement please go to:

https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel-announce/2010-June/000721.html

==== Kubuntu: Maverick Alpha 1 Released ====

The first alpha release of Kubuntu Maverick has been released. This alpha contains the recently announced Amarok 2.3.1 and KDE SC 4.5 beta.

For more information on Kubuntu Maverick Alpha 1 Release go to:

http://www.kubuntu.org/news/maverick-alpha1

==== Postponing Ubuntu User Days ====

With the second Ubuntu User Day being less than a week away, and in going over our final checklist, it has come to our attention it would be a better event, both in attendance and in the choice of session if we were to
postpone this event.

While we understand that you may have scheduled time on the June 5th, 2010, to facilitate a session or participate by attending we want the experience of both session leaders and participants to be the best possible.

Keeping in mind we want to present the best possible learning opportunity, we have made the decision to postpone this event until '''July 10, 2010'''.

It is our, the User Days Planners, sincere hope that this will not be an inconvenience to you or any helpers with your session.

Thank you so much for you understanding!  We are looking forward to another great second Ubuntu User Day (but a few weeks later and with more planning,promotion, participants, and more awesome session leaders like yourselves).

The original announcement can be found at:

https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-classroom/2010-June/000192.html

==== Call for Testing: Hardy Firefox Users (or willing to install Hardy in a VM) ====

'''Background''':
Firefox 3.0 and xulrunner 1.9 are now unsupported by Mozilla. Rather than backporting security fixes to these now, we are moving to a support model where we will be introducing major new upstream versions in stable releases. The reason for this is the support periods from Mozilla are gradually becoming shorter, and it will be more and more difficult for us to maintain our current support model in the future.

'''What we are going to do''':
We are going to release Firefox 3.6.4 as a minor update to the 3.6 series in Lucid. This will also be rolled out to Hardy, Jaunty and Karmic (along with xulrunner 1.9.2.4). The update for Lucid is quite trivial, but the update in Hardy, Jaunty and Karmic is not quite as simple.

Before releasing these updates to the public, we need testing in Firefox, the extensions in the archive and distributions upgrades after those updates. We have published all these packages in a PPA and we will track test results before moving anything to the archive.

'''How you can help''':
We need people running *Hardy* (Jaunty and Karmic will see a similar call for testing in the following days) in bare metal or a virtual machine. If you are willing to help, the instructions can be found at the link below:

http://ubuntutesting.wordpress.com/2010/06/01/call-for-testing-firefox/

==== Request For Help Preparing ClassBot For Translations ====

A few weeks ago, I was approached by some people from the Ubuntu Classroom-ES about having a Spanish version of Class``Bot to help out with their Open Week. Thanks to some help with translations, I was able to create Clase``Bot. The problem is, due to the way that the translations were done, if I make a change to the Class``Bot code, it will have to be manually applied to Clase``Bot. Ideally, I would like to have Class``Bot setup to use Launchpad to allow people to translate it. The problem is that I have no experience using Gettext or with using Launchpad for translations. Class``Bot is also a Perl script, so that also makes it a bit more challenging to find examples. If there is someone who has a bit more experience in this area, please get in contact with Nathan Handler.

To get read the post in full or to get in touch with Nathan please go to:

==== Operation Cleansweep Launched! ====

At UDS-M in Brussels, Jono had announced Operation Cleansweep.  Nigel announced as of June 4th, 2010 that Operation Cleansweep has launched.  Nigel notes that Operation Cleansweep team has been able to subscribe to all the bugs with patches (minus the blacklisted packages).

As of June 4th, 2010, there was 1952 bugs with patches to be cleared by the project and around 80 to 90 patches being added every month.  Operation Cleansweep has set an initial daily target of 15 bugs per day.  Nigel tells others they can participate in Operation Cleansweep.  He notes people can help by reviewing the patches, talking people into reviewing patches, and even putting up the meter on your website.

To learn more about Operation Cleansweep, and how you can participate please go to:

==== Linaro: Accelerating Linux on ARM ====

At our last UDS in Belgium it was notable how many people were interested in the ARM architecture. There have always been sessions at UDS about lightweight environments for the consumer electronics and embedded community, but this felt tangibly different. I saw questions being asked about ARM in server and cloud tracks, for example, and in desktop tracks. That’s new.

So I’m very excited at today’s announcement of Linaro, an initiative by the ARM partner ecosystem including Freescale, IBM, Samsung, ST-Ericsson and TI, to accelerate and unify the field of Linux on ARM. That is going to make it much easier for developers to target ARM generally, and build solutions that can work with the amazing diversity of ARM hardware that exists today.

The ARM platform has historically been superspecialized and hence fragmented – multiple different ARM-based CPU’s from multiple different ARM silicon partners all behaved differently enough that one needed to develop different software for each of them. Boot loaders, toolchains, kernels, drivers and middleware are all fragmented today, and of course there’s additional fragmentation associated with Android vs mainline on ARM, but Linaro will go a long way towards cleaning this up and making it possible to deliver a consistent platform experience across all of the major ARM hardware providers.

Having played with a prototype ARM netbook, I was amazed at how cool it felt. Even though it was just a prototype it was super-thin, and ran completely cool. It felt like a radical leap forward for the state of the art in netbooks. So I’m a fan of fanless computing, and can’t wait to get one off the shelf.

For product developers, the big benefit from Linaro will be reduced time to market and increased choice of hardware. If you can develop your software for “linux on ARM”, rather than a specific CPU, you can choose the right hardware for your project later in the development cycle, and reduce the time required for enablement of that hardware. Consumer electronics product development cycles should drop significantly as a result. That means that all of us get better gadgets, sooner, and great software can spread faster through the ecosystem.

==== LoCo Teams Best Practices and Guidelines ====

Laura Czajkowski, of the Ubuntu Lo``Co Council writes about Ubuntu Lo``Co teams best practices and guidelines on her blog.  Those are guidelines and practices are broken down into 3 areas which include:

1. MONTHLY TASKS

* Monthly meeting – publish mins to mailing list/forums and update wiki.
** Set a chair for 2-3 months and  rotate it
** Someone to publish mins to mailing  list/forums and mailing list (share out the roles)
** Update/create a monthly report
** One person to create the report and  add content to it. Mail the list and ask for input in case folks had organised or participated in events within the OSS/Ubuntu community.
** Meet ups – face to face , publish you had these events, link these to the report
** Take pictures!
** Blog about them
** For larger events publish a report after the event to the loco contacts mailing list
** Add All of the events to the Lo``Co Directory!

2. CYCLE BASED GOALS

** Release Party
** Global Jam

3. LONG TERM GOALS

** Create a a mentoring program on the below  areas and train people in those areas
** Help get existing members of the  community into positions in the Lo``Co where they can do the most good
** Help new ( and novice ) members find members to provide some level of help to ensure the new member can contribute in a useful way
** Encourage and mentor for Ubuntu Membership
** Try to create contact with the Lo``Cos around you, in order to find any potential cross-action

Some other best practices that based on both Laura's blog and the Lo``Co Council wiki pages included delegating team roles.  These roles include:

* Chair of meetings

* Web Admin

* Mailing list Admin

* IRC Ops

==== Help translating the LoCo Teams Best Practices and Guidelines ====

We've got some more content that would be very interesting for Lo``Cos to have translated. Check this out:

https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LoCoCouncil/LoCoTeamsBestPracticesandGuidelines

The Lo``Co Council developed a series of best practices and guidelines to help all Lo``Cos to be more successful, and it would be awesome to have it in YOUR language to allow everyone contribute making your Lo``Co rock even harder.

Here's how you can help:

* Add your language and a link to the page where you want to put the translation to the table on top of https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LoCoCouncil/LoCoTeamsBestPracticesandGuidelines I've added some few languages already for your convenience, and some folks have even already started translating!
* I recommend creating a subpage named after the two-letter or three-letter code for your language (e.g. LoCoTeamsBestPracticesandGuidelines/de for German). You'll find a list of codes here [1].
* Copy the content of the page in English to your new page
* Translate!
* Save your translation and you're done :) Check out the Spanish or Italian translations for an example:

https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LoCoCouncil/LoCoTeamsBestPracticesandGuidelines/es https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LoCoCouncil/LoCoTeamsBestPracticesandGuidelines/it

==== The LoCo Directory wants to speak your language ====

The Lo``Co Directory hackers have asked for some more help in getting the directory translated and thus more usable for your Lo``Co.

You can contribute to it the usual way by going to:

https://translations.launchpad.net/loco-directory

And leaving your suggestions or translations. We've got 7 languages which are nearly completed, and it would really be awesome if also Catalan, Finnish, French, Czech, Asturian, Serbian, Bengali, Greek, Ukrainian, Russian, Romanian, English (United Kingdom), Dutch, Swedish, Galician, Hebrew, Chinese (Traditional), Chinese (Simplified), Vietnamese, Irish, Thai, Arabic, Tamil, Turkish, Welsh, Portuguese, Slovak, Polish, Persian, Danish, Belarusian, and more! would get some translation love.

The Lo``Co Directory has continuous releases, although there are generally not big string changes, so remember to check it out and translate new strings from time to time.

=== Launchpad News ===

==== Jono Bacon: Why Launchpad Rocks: Working With Code Is Dead Simple ====

Jono Bacon continues his series on Why Launchpad Rocks.  In this article he talks about Working With Code is Dead Simple.

This article is part of a series of articles about why I feel Launchpad is a great home for your Open Source project. I am writing these articles not as an employee of Canonical, but instead as a happy Launchpad user who gets agitated that not enough people know how cool Launchpad is.

Jono has the following to say the simplicity of working with code in Launchpad:

''One of the things I love about Launchpad is that getting, hacking, sharing, merging in code is dead simple. Much of this is because of it’s tight integration with the Bazaar version control system. Together it provides akid-in-candy-shop level of awesome if you like to run and hack on code.

One of the things I love about Bazaar is that it is focused on simplicity, and having used CVS and Subversion in the past, and a little bit of git recently, I find Bazaar by far the most naturally connected with my workflow. The reason for this is that I don’t want to care about version control. I am not interested in it, I don’t want to learn it, I don’t plan on sending it a Christmas card; I merely want to learn enough to get code from somewhere, upload it somewhere and rock with it. Bazaar is well suited to my needs because it’s simplicity means that it doesn’t feel like a pain to use.''

This article is part of a series of articles about why I feel Launchpad is a great home for your Open Source project. I am writing these articles not as an employee of Canonical, but instead as a happy Launchpad user who gets agitated that not enough people know how cool Launchpad is.
Jono has the following to say the simplicity of working with code in Launchpad:

''Open Source is fundamentally driven by gifts. People contribute translations, documentation, artwork, code and more. Many of these gifts are made available in the form of patches; fragments of content that can be applied to other chunks of content to apply new features, resolve issues or add value in other ways. Patches are wonderful contributions. their authors take the time to care about a problem and invest their expertise and time in producing a solution that everyone can share and benefit from. As such, we should treat these patches with the due care and attention that they deserve.

Something we found in Ubuntu was that we were getting so many patches submitted that many were being lost in the mix and were not getting reviewed and applied if appropriate. This goes against the grain of a gift – we should always review these gifts with a strong sense of care and timeliness. The situation was not driven by carelessness or malice, but instead a lack of visibility on these available patches for a given project.''

==== Daniel Holbach's blog: NGO Team during Maverick ====

Daniel Holbach discusses the NGO Team plans for the Maverick cycle in this blog post. Daniel states, " I’m very happy with the plans of the Ubuntu NGO team this cycle."

The following list is what Daniel states that the NGO Team wants to accomplish:

* have more regular meetings – once a month
* get an overview of NGO-related blueprints in maverick (http://hexmode.openweblog.com/538142.html)
* come up with specific questions for interviews
* work on stats/feedback from the interviews – find out what works very well for NGO – tools they’ve built on their own
* put together spec and blog, post to mailing list announcing Manifestand create branch to make it easier for others to contribute
* document set-up and install for common applications for NGOs
* create Facebook group
* investigate if there’s “NGO Planet websites” somewhere
* find list of groups of websites and list of organisations
* See if NGOs would consider document their work – best practices

If you’re interested in stuff that non-profits, NGOs and charities do, in Ubuntu and making the world a better place. Join the team and the mailing list and contribute!

==== Danny Piccirillo: Free culture projects need a ubiquitous funding system ====

The free culture and free software movements have made a lot of great progress but still struggle to prove economically viable in the mainstream. The Software Freedom Conservancy exists as a fiscal sponsor for free software projects, basically helping projects get the protections of a corporation, without having to form one. The Conservancy is a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organization, so member projects can receive tax-deductible donations. In order to prove viable in the mainstream, the infrastructure of this system would need to scale, plus add more features. Perhaps inviting non-free culture projects to participate on a limited basis, could help pique interest. If there were such a system, free culture projects would be able to expand and prove viable on a much larger scale.

==== Colin Watson: Hacking on grub2 ====

In this article, Colin Watson addresses the state of the Grub2 package. Various people observed in a long thread on debian-devel that the grub2 package was in a bit of a mess in terms of its release-critical bug count. Along with fixing these issues, making 'grub-mkconfig' a bit more robust (in the event that the root filesystem isn't one that GRUB understands) and writing more documentation are on the list. Quoted from the article: "If you'd like to help, contact me, especially if there's something particular that isn't being handled that you think you could work on."

==== Ubuntu LTS 10.04, a Linux OS at its Best ====

Juliet Kemp, Server``Watch, writes about her experience with Ubuntu 10.04. In this article she walks readers through installing the Ubuntu 10.04 Server as well as her first impressions if the Ubuntu 10.04 Server.

Juliet had this to say about the Ubuntu 10.04 LTS Server - ''It's convenient to have a server install that's entirely separate from the desktop install, and while it may not be as visually slick as the desktop version, that's not really what you want on a server. The install was straightforward; I really liked the package collections; and everything was functional on first bootup. Five years of support is good, and all the software installed was fairly up-to-date (within a couple of release points, which is reasonable given the testing cycle needed for a long-term release). Ubuntu provides security updates regularly, so any security improvements in more recent releases should be rolled out to your servers quickly.

One problem I found was that the documentation available online is a bit shaky. In some cases, it still refers to earlier releases, which isn't very reassuring. However, Ubuntu is obviously making an effort with its documentation, and it's easier to find information than it is with some other distros.

Overall, Lucid Lynx is an impressive offering and definitely something I'd be happy to use for my own servers. More console-driven system management tools and better documentation, would make it an even better option.''

==== Ubuntu Accessibility Team ====

Michael Maclean, from the Ubuntu UK Lo``Co team talks about getting involved with the Ubuntu Accessibility Team. Michael notes that he has recently become involved, at the suggestion of Penelope Stowe who is an instrumental part at resurrecting the Ubuntu Accessibility Team.  He notes that Penelope arranged an Accessibility session at UDS-M that "seems to have gone quite well" Micheal points out that,''The main focus for the team right now is getting organised, and to this end we're aiming to create a set of personas, which are representations of hypothetical users with various accessibility requirements which developers and testers can keep in mind when working on the next Ubuntu release. These personas are going to be developed by a survey which will be dispatched to a host of groups who may have accessibility requirements to get an idea of what the main factors that affect their experience with Ubuntu are, so we can get an idea of the main areas to improve. Hopefully then the work which will take place as a result of these can be sent upstream to the original projects.''

==== Towards Linaro 10.11 ====

Jamie Bennett, the Linaro Release Manager for Canonical, looks toward Linaro 10.11 in this article.

Linaro is an initiative undertaken by ARM, Canonical and partners with the task of improving the state of the whole Linux on ARM ecosphere. It brings together the vast talents of the open source community and ARM’s wealth of experience in the electronics industry to work on key and game-changing projects. It will work in the various upstreams where possible and provide engineering, technical and guidance support for a wide and diverse set of problem area’s. Linaro will not just help other projects, there will also be a clear set of deliverables which will culminate Linaro’s efforts into regular 6 monthly engineering releases, starting this November.

==== Ubuntu Systems Management update ====

We released a new version of Landscape our management service for Ubuntu last week. There’s a slew of new features including server templates, simple upgrades and enterprise authentication support.  Whether you’re managing a few systems or as many as Google the new features make system administration simpler!

Landscape’s objective is to make managing and monitoring hundreds of Ubuntu systems as easy as looking after one. Whether you’re managing some Ubuntu desktops, or looking after a Web server farm Landscape lowers the complexity of administering those systems: no-one wants to apply patches to hundreds of machines manually! For IT managers this means that Landscape makes system administrators more effective and efficient. Landscape also ensures that deployed Ubuntu systems are secure with maintenance patches and upgrades.

Landscape is provided as a software service so every six months Canonical releases a new version that is available to all subscribers. There’s also an on-site version available to customers that have security policies or regulations that prevent them using a SaaS management platform.

To learn more, try the demo and sign up for an invite:

https://hub.turnkeylinux.org/

According to the developers, support for additional cloud platforms, as well as automatic backup and migration functionality is in the works:

"Imagine being able to develop your site on a locally running appliance (e.g., running in Virtual``Box or VMWare). Then, when you're ready you can automatically migrate your appliance, with all your customizations to a cloud hosting provider of your choice."

===== LoCo Council =====

Ubuntu-UY was up for first. Their website has been re-branded with the the new Ubuntu branding, and they have been very active. Their Approval Application was dynamite and easily reflected their recent events as well as their hopes for the near future. Congratulations to the Uruguay Team! We really appreciate your hard work and look forward to what your team will achieve for Ubuntu.

Ubuntu-MX has done some extremely great things for the community. Their Podcast is doing really well, and they are beginning to recover from some huge hurdles (quarantined areas to help contain N1``H1 for example). The Lo``Co Council felt unanimously that Ubuntu-MX should take a little time to get themselves back on track, asking them re-apply in September. Lo``Co Council members volunteered to help guide them through the re-approval process, and answer any questions they have while preparing.

===== Technical Board =====

* Meeting of the TB, 2010-06-01

** Chair: Keybuk

** Present: kees, mdz, pitti, sabdfl

** Review of Actions

** Keybuk had sent draft mail to TB about sparc and ia64 ports, no objections were received, so the board carried and keybuk will send the mail

** Chromium standing FFe

** The board discussed a standing Feature Freeze Exception for Chromium, however since the package has not yet had any SRUs, it was decided that this should be deferred until a reasonable (Kees suggested 3) number had been completed.  Martin Pitt will re-raise this once he feels it has proven it's worth an exception.

** Community Bugs

** The board resolved that the issue of ubuntu-drivers many roles should be a medium-priority bug, and should be fed back to the Launchpad team as part of the usual process

** Chair for next meeting: cjwatson

* Meeting of the TB, 2010-05-18

** Chair: sabdfl

** Present: cjwatson, kees, keybuk, mdz, pitti, sabdfl

** Review of Actions

** On Reinhard's patent question: pitti got a reply from Amanda [Canonical legal] and replied to Reinhard and tb@

** cjwatson has sync'd MoM

** pitti has switched Soyuz' sync-source.py

** 10.10.10

** The Board continued their discussion on the proposed release date for Maverick Meerkat. Concern was expressed about releasing on a Sunday: it was agreed that the release would need to be prepared by the previous Friday. Various stakeholders (webmaster, marketing) will be ready for the release on the Sunday, but the bulk of the work should wrap during the previous work week and only a skeleton team need be in place over the weekend, barring a release crisis.

** The updated release schedule, with 10.10.10 has been published, and should now be considered canonical :-)

** Releases to 12.04

** The Board discussed Robbie's data on the factors affecting actual development time during releases. It's now clear that April releases get reduced developer time, due to the number of Western holidays during the cycle. As a result, we would like to release the October release a little earlier than we have in the past.

** The Board voted and approved a proposal to ask Jorge Castro to engage with the GNOME release team, to see if they have similar dynamics in their cycle, and are amenable to aligning in this way. In addition, we asked Jorge to explore the possibility of publishing a schedule of release dates for 10.10 till 12.04, now. That would allow us to fix the dates of conferences, sprints and other events further in advance.

** The Board also discussed avoiding the final week of the month for releases, but the idea did not carry and no consensus emerged.

** Sparc and IA64 Status

** Keybuk pointed the Board at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArchitectureStatus which lists architectures and gives an indication of their degree of support in Ubuntu.

** The Board approved that Keybuk publicise that page, together with the statement that SPARC and IA64 are declining in levels of usage and maintenance to the point where they are candidates for decommissioning. In the case of SPARC, the issues are severe, with kernel and toolchain causing problems to the point of SPARC being unusable. In the case of IA64, there was some discussion of benefits to the team of having IA64 builds, and a recognition of the fact that kernel and toolchain are in better shape. Nevertheless, the decision was taken that unless a substantial community effort rallies around IA64, it should also be decommissioned, and Keybuk will frame the mail that way.

** Derivative hosting requests

** Persia asked if the TB needed to be involved in questions about new derivatives, and the decision was that yes, if the request involved hosting or modifications to key infrastructure and build services, then requests should be addressed by the TB.

** The chair for the next TB will be Keybuk.

* Technical Board meeting, 2010-05-04

** Attendees: Martin Pitt (chair), Kees Cook, Matt Zimmerman, Colin Watson, Mark Shuttleworth

** Guests: Jonathan Riddell, Scott Kitterman, Emmet Hikory

** Action review

** Riddell and ScottK to sort next steps of KDE Updates process

*** Outstanding, but there was progress this week

** cjwatson to write up 2010-03-09 meeting minutes

*** Outstanding

** cjwatson to drive libfaac issue to conclusion

*** Outstanding

** Scan the mailing list archive for anything we missed

** That was done, added to agenda below

** Request for Kubuntu Unseeded Packages Team

** Would be best to create an explicit list of packages as a seed, based on the "reverse dependency" criterion

** Once this list is done, DMB can implement

** Scope of Canonical's acquired ffmpeg patent licenses for derivatives

** This is believed to be strictly an OEM business, and not apply to Ubuntu in general

** [ACTION] Martin to confirm with Canonical's legal department and follow up

** Default sync source for Maverick

** During lucid we synced from Debian testing by default; recently a survey (https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2010-April/030594.html) was done (summary (https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2010-April/030655.html))

** The TB unanimously voted for switching back to unstable for Maverick

*** [ACTION] cjwatson to switch MoM (''done''))

*** [ACTION] pitti to get Soyuz' sync-source.py switched

** Chair for next meeting: Mark Shuttleworth

** Removing the page in favour of linking elsewhere in the Wiki. ie: Ubuntu Sign``Post (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Signpost/Questions#help).

** ZachK_ offered to take the task of actioning this.

* Discussed replacing Votebot with ubottu.

** All members present were largely in favour of Votebot's deprecation.

** Council are to vote on Votebot's removal from the main channels.

* BT Council proposed a new draft for the membership requirements (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Paultag/UBTCriteria) process to the rest of the team.

** Discussions to continue on the Mailing List and Wiki.

* ZachK_ announced that the Summer of Documentation is just around the corner, and requested for any members to help out.

* cjohnston discussed an opportunity for the BT to help out in redesigning the Ubuntu Community page on the Ubuntu site. http://www.ubuntu.com/community

** Any member interested in helping, are to email, or PM cjohnston.
