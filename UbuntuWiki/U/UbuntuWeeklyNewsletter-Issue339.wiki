Canonical announces the next version of Ubuntu for server and cloud environments which makes it possible to deploy a full Open``Stack cloud on only five servers and offers a sophisticated Landscape dashboard for the management of Ubuntu Open``Stack clouds no matter their size.  Mark Shuttleworth says “Ubuntu 13.10 delivers the latest and best version of Open``Stack, and is the fastest, most flexible platform for scale-out computing,” and adds “Ubuntu is typically used in very large scale deployments. In this release we’ve tuned the cloud deployment experience for very small clusters as well, to support dev-and-test environments.”

==== Latest Ubuntu 13.10 includes first step to mobile / PC convergence ====

==== Preloaded Linux systems: Weighing the options ====

Serdar Yegulalp of Computer``World takes at look at the alternatives for users who don't have the time or inclination to install Linux themselves. Serdar lists several good reasons for having Linux as a preloaded OS, some big-name vendors, some independent system builders and concludes that buying a custom built system is the costliest option and adds "But it also goes a long way towards guaranteeing that the entire system -- Linux distribution, drivers, hardware and all -- works well as one complete system."

==== Ubuntu 13.10: OpenStack Havana Support, Cloud, Server Updates ====

The VAR Guy writes that Ubuntu 13.10 contains new features for Open``Stack, VMware (VMW) vSphere and other cloud platforms in addition to updates for desktop users. The VAR Guy says "The message the company is sending currently is that Ubuntu's strength in the cloud lies in its ability to integrate a variety of components—from Open``Stack to VMware vSphere—into a single platform that offers easy deployability and scalability. Keeping up with the latest upstream versions of important cloud packages, too, will surely help Canonical as it continues to compete for its slice of the cloud market."

==== Calendar App adds new visuals and refined event-related view ====

razvi of iloveubuntu writes that the Calendar App has been updated with a newly-added dark bar on multiple views, including Month, Week, Day and Year, dark bar acting as a background for time elements (such as days), properly differentiating the days from the rest of the view. razvi provides some screenshots to illustrate the professional designs.

==== [Ubuntu in the wild] MIT uses Ubuntu ====

razvi of iloveubuntu writes about MIT, a private research university located in Cambridge, Massachusetts and shows us a clip of a futuristic project that is demoed with Ubuntu and Unity. razvi says "Along with the behind-camera usage, Ubuntu with Unity is retained in front of the camera, too, where the researchers are interviewed, interview populated with Ubuntu being harnessed in delivering a crash-free non-faulty public demo."

==== Will Mir Come On The Ubuntu 14.04 Desktop? ====

Michael Larabel of Phoronix writes that the original plan was to ship Mir as the default display environment for Ubuntu 13.10 and all eyes are on the latest developments for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. Michael reckons that it would be odd for Mir to be shipped by default and says "Modern Ubuntu LTS releases are maintained on the desktop for a period of five years so generally Canonical is conservative with pushing major user-facing changes into these versions."
