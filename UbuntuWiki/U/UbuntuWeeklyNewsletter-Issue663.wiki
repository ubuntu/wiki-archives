==== Snap Tips ====

Alan Pope provides us with various tips useful for snap & snapd. Alan notes this is kind of a bunch of random snap commands found in complete detail in the snapcraft documentation (link provided). Alan provides numerous examples, including a link to his Git``Hub for pull-requests & issues should we have any.

==== My 'Must-Have' GNOME Extensions ====

Alan Pope relates for us the extensions he has added to his Ubuntu 20.10 GNOME Shell to supplement the default. Here he details: Sound Switcher Indicator, Snap Manager, Hue Lights, and CPU Power Manager. Alan notes "GNOME Shell on Ubuntu is a super productive environment ... it’s possible to customise the environment to your needs". Alan invites others to blog about their favorite extensions in hopes of propagating knowledge about GNOME extensions and features.
