==== Ubuntu is coming to a city near you ====

=== In The Press ===

==== 10 Reasons Why Ubuntu Is Killing It In The Cloud ====

Janakiram MSV of Forbes shares various statistics to support why “Ubuntu is most preferred OS by system administrators and Dev``Ops professionals.” Included are the number of Ubuntu instances “launched in the cloud”. In 2015, major organizations run Ubuntu, and more.

http://www.forbes.com/sites/janakirammsv/2016/01/12/10-reasons-why-ubuntu-is-killing-it-in-the-cloud/#2715e4857a0b706f52e119a2

=== In The Blogosphere ===

==== The one glitch in Canonical's convergence plan ====

Jack Wallen of Tech``Republic tells us that he thinks that the Ubuntu Phone platform is far from ready as it has “a pathetic cloud presence” because the Dropbox and Google Drive apps barely work, and that syncing calendars and contacts is not easy. He first asks: “And Canonical wants to converge that with the desktop?” and finishes with another question: “Do you believe convergence can happen without a cloud presence?”

http://www.techrepublic.com/article/the-one-glitch-in-canonicals-convergence-plan/

==== Ubuntu Touch OTA-9 Custom Tarballs Now Ready for Meizu MX4 and BQ Aquaris Phones ====

Marius Nestor, writing for Softpedia, tells us that he’s been informed of the work that has been done by the Ubuntu Touch developers in preparation for the OTA-9 software update. He says that Canonical’s Łukasz Zemczak has urged all those involved in Ubuntu Touch development to take a look at the remaining regressions ahead of the release candidate images being released.

http://news.softpedia.com/news/ubuntu-touch-ota-9-custom-tarballs-now-ready-for-meizu-mx4-and-bq-aquaris-phones-498946.shtml

==== New Ubuntu Convergence Device To Be Announced Next Month? ====

Joey-Elijah Sneddon of OMG! Ubuntu! writes that details he’s seen suggest that Canonical will showcase their progress in creating a software environment that transforms from mobile to desktop PC at the Mobile World Congress which takes place 22nd-25th February in Barcelona, Spain. He speculates what type of device has been codenamed “Frieza”, saying it could be a BQ M10 tablet which developers are using to test the convergent codebase or the “convergent phone Canonical teased back in June of last year.”

http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2016/01/ubuntu-convergence-device-demo-mwc-2016

==== Ubuntu 16.04 LTS Will Be the Best Release in Years, Here's What's New ====

Silviu Stahie of Softpedia writes that although Ubuntu 16.04 is still a month away from feature freeze, the release has already received some new features such as being able to move the Unity launcher, a new USB Startup Creator, and a Plymouth boot splash. He says that the developers are also working on introducing GNOME Calendar, Snappy packages, the ZFS file system, and GNOME Software but that Brasero and Empathy will be dropped.

==== How You Can Help Test the New Ubuntu Software Center ====

Joey-Elijah Sneddon of OMG! Ubuntu! informs us that in order to test the replacement for the Ubuntu Software Center in Xenial Xerus a PPA needs to be used. He advises how to add the PPA, warns us to expect missing features, crashes and bugs, and asks us to report any bugs found against the gnome-software package on Launchpad.

==== UbuCon Summit in California to Cover Convergence, Gaming, IoT, and Everything Else ====

Silviu Stahie, writing for Softpedia, lets us know that it’s been a while since the last Ubuntu Summit where people gathered in the same room, and that this Summit is part of SCALE14x which takes place in Pasadena, California on January 21-22, 2016. He summarizes the events, which include a keynote by Mark Shuttleworth, a hands-on demo with Snapcraft and Ubuntu snaps, sessions about Ubuntu gaming, a discussion about Kubuntu, and talks about Ubuntu convergence.

==== Canonical: One Billion People "Benefit from" Ubuntu Linux ====

Christopher Tozzi, The VAR Guy, reminds us that a “Canonical executive” has stated that more than one billion people benefit from Ubuntu. However, he suggests that the statement is an admission that Canonical has little idea how many people run Ubuntu as few hard statistics have been offered. Tozzi discusses the relevance of any estimate by comparing the usage with that of a pizza delivery man using a Honda car. He admits: “Many, many people do use Ubuntu in indirect ways.”
