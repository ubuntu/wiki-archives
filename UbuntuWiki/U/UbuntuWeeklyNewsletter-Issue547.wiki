=== In Other News ===

==== Microsoft killing off the old Skype client… for real this time ====

Peter Bright reminds us that Microsoft announced back in July 2018 that they were ending support for their 'classic' Skype client which caused a community backlash. Its life was extended but now support ends in November. The newer client is the same for all platforms thus reducing development costs, with a warning that Skype network protocols may change, preventing the old client from working at all.
