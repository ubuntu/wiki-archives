=== Welcome! ===
This is the wiki page of the UAE Local Community Team. We aim to provide free community support to users of the various flavours of Ubuntu as well as advocating the use of Ubuntu to individuals and organisations alike. We keep in touch via our active <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-ae|email list]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[UAETeam-IRC| IRC chatroom]]</nowiki>. This group is for anyone in the United Arab Emirates who uses or is interested in some flavour of Ubuntu, whether it's Ubuntu, Kubuntu or any others. This group is for people of all technical abilities from I've-never-heard-of-linux all the way to I'm-an-Ubuntu-Master.

=== Mission Statement ===
The UAE Ubuntu Team (Ubuntu-AE) is united by a commitment to the philosophy of Ubuntu and FOSS (Free and Open Source Software).

We therefore advocate freedom from the constraints of proprietary software and enjoy the power to make our own choices to meet our computing needs.

Ubuntu-AE provides a common hub to share ideas, resources and experiences to enable localised Ubuntu user groups to distribute, advertise, promote and demonstrate Ubuntu throughout UAE. 

=== How do I join? ===
There is no official process to join, however if you join the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/people/ubuntu-ae|launchpad team]]</nowiki> you are then able to vote in polls organised by the group. Discussion happens on the <nowiki>[[http://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-ae|mailing list]]</nowiki> which you are free to join. There is also an active group of members who chat in real time on <nowiki>[[UAETeam-IRC|IRC]]</nowiki> in the #ubuntu-ae channel on irc.freenode.net.

=== Meetings ===
Meetings for Ubuntu-AE usually happen once a month.
