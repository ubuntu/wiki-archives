==== XMir update for Ubuntu 13.10 ====

Oliver Ries announces that while the Mir team is on track to support native Mir + Unity 8 running on Ubuntu Touch images, they not going to be able to deliver Mir + XMir + Unity 7 as the default experience on the desktop for the Ubuntu 13.10. Oliver says "Mir has made tremendous progress and is currently available on the Ubuntu archive for use, but there are still some outstanding quality issues that we want to resolve before we feel comfortable turning it on by default" and links to a Q&A for further information.

==== Jonathan Riddell: Kubuntu Beastie Fixing ====

Jonathan Riddell addresses a positive response to a recent bug report, writing "Bugs are a pain, especially when a fiddly one comes along involving Python bindings, the number of people who understand SIP is pretty low. So it's nice we were able to fix it quickly." Jonathan quotes from a bug report and adds "Wish we could do them all that smoothly!"

=== In The Press ===

==== French National Police Switch 37,000 Desktop PCs to Linux ====

Klint Finley of Wired.com reports that France’s National Gendarmerie is now running 37,000 desktop PCs with a custom version of the Linux operating system, and the agency plans to move all 72,000 of its desktop machines to the open source OS. Klint says this is one of the largest known government deployments of Linux on the desktop which started in 2008 when it switched 5,000 users to a Linux OS based on Ubuntu.

http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/09/gendarmerie_linux/

==== Ubuntu 13.10: Meet the Linux distro with a bizarre Britney Spears fixation ====

Scott Gilbertson of The Register reports that Ubuntu 13.10 is shaping up to be “a solid, if slightly dull, Linux distro” and that there have been no major visual changes to the desktop, only a couple of expanded features for the Unity Dash, which means 13.10, due 17 October, won't look all that different from the last release of Ubuntu when it arrives. Scott concludes "So while the big stuff is under the hood or yet to come, there are a couple of new things you'll notice if you decided to test this beta. The biggest and most obvious is the new Smart Scopes service, which adds a ton of new search results to the Unity Dash."

=== In The Blogosphere ===

==== Ubuntu user replaces proprietary OS with Ubuntu on mother's computer, the result: "she loves it" ====

razvi of iloveubuntu writes that the Ubuntu-passionate user Suicidalparrot shared an interesting personal happening, namely, installing Ubuntu 13.04 on the computer of the user's mother, shifting the mother's machine from the proprietary Windows 7 to the solid-as-a-rock Ubuntu 13.04 with the result "she loves it, especially since it went from a barely usable hunk of junk to running like a brand new machine." razvi adds that perhaps the most important aspect of this is the reminder of how each one of us is able to recommend Ubuntu to a friend on a daily basis.

==== Ubuntu 14.04 LTS To Stay On GTK/GNOME 3.8? ====

Andrew of Web``Upd8 writes that Sebastien Bacher, software engineer at Canonical, recently posted a message on the Ubuntu Desktop mailing list in which he proposes that Ubuntu stays on GTK/GNOME 3.8 for the next cycle (Ubuntu 14.04 LTS). Andrew says “Ubuntu 14.04 will lag two releases behind GNOME which will affect Ubuntu GNOME, Ubuntu users who are contributing to GNOME as well as some non-core GNOME applications that require the latest GNOME technologies” but points out that Sebastien Bacher's message is just a suggestion.

==== The demand for Ubuntu continues to grow, Ubuntu already shipping in India, China, Mexico, USA, Ukraine ====

razvi of iloveubuntu refers to an article published by Ubuntu's Maria Bonnefon which looks at the areas of the world where Ubuntu is shipped on computers and lists the exciting amount of Ubuntu partners. From the article razvi quotes "The growth of Ubuntu has also been driven through our strong partnership with major hardware OEM brands such as Dell, HP, Lenovo, Asus and Acer. Not only is Ubuntu generally available pre-loaded from these leading OEMs, but in many regions we’ve entered into full retail partnership with dedicated stores."

==== Canonical Store Adds New Mug, T-Shirts & Mousemat Set ====

Joey-Elijah Sneddon of OMG! Ubuntu! reports that Canonical’s online shop has been restocked ahead of the release of Ubuntu 13.10 with a number of brand new items including a new look Ubuntu mug and a redesigned mouse mat. Joey provides illustrations of the various items but reminds us that the drawback to buying from the Canonical Store is the shipping costs which remain slightly exorbitant for most outside of the UK (and for many within).

==== Stylish Saucy Salamander-branded t-shirts available for purchase on Canonical Shop ====

razvi of iloveubuntu shows us some t-shirts that have been created with the upcoming release of Saucy Salamander in mind and that are available from Ubuntu's official shop. razvi adds "The Saucy Salamander t-shirts come for both men and women, retaining the same design with certain gender-specific modifications."

==== Ubuntu 13.10 Release: Five Requirements for Success ====

The Var Guy writes about the 5 major requirements for Ubuntu to succeed on all platforms (mobile, desktop, server and cloud) and attract partners and customers.

==== Unity 7 updated with minor-yet-relevant new names in Ubuntu 13.10 ====

razvi of iloveubuntu writes that Unity 7 has been enriched in Ubuntu 13.10 with newly-renamed text descriptions, optimizing its parts with more natural names. razvi provides some screenshots to illustrate the changes and says "The new names, while minor, significantly strengthen and improve the Dash's identity and clarity, removing inconsistencies and incomplete own identity, aligning the Dash's power to optimized names."

http://iloveubuntu.net/unity-7-updated-minor-yet-relevant-new-names-ubuntu-1310

==== Mir 0.0.13 Released With Various Fixes ====

Michael Larabel of Phoronix writes "While Mir won't be part of the default Ubuntu 13.10 desktop, it will be part of Ubuntu Touch 13.10 and development is continuing in a steadfast manner to make it ready for the desktop in 2014. Mir 0.0.13 was released today while bumping the Mir Server library to version 5." Michael lists some of the changes and says that the updated packages should be available in the Ubuntu Saucy archive soon.

==== ezgo - Free And Open Source Software In Taiwan's Schools ====

Franklin Weng writes "Free and Open Source Software in Taiwan has made impressive strides thanks to the work of the 'ezgo' team" and talks at length about what the ezgo project is. Franklin informs us that Kubuntu is now being used as their base distribution, that the New Taipei City government decided to use a free and open source operating system instead of Microsoft Windows in their new 10,000 PCs for elementary schools, and that ezgo 11 was selected as their pre-installed OS.
