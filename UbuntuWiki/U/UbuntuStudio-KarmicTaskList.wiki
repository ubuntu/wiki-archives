| '''Task'''

| '''Assignee'''
|-
| <nowiki>[[UbuntuStudio-TaskMaintainRealtimeKernelPackage|Maintain realtime kernel package]]</nowiki>
| This is on a best effort basis, since the realtime patches often lag behind the latest kernel upstream release, as well as the Ubuntu kernel release.
| LukeYelavich (TheMuso)
|-
| <nowiki>[[UbuntuStudio-TaskDVDTesting|DVD Testing]]</nowiki>
| Testing alpha images at a minimum, testing one or two dailies a week would be preferable.
| AsmoKoskinen, <nowiki>[[stochastic|Eric Hedekar (stochastic)]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[Galvesband|Rafa Gálvez (Galvesband)]]</nowiki>
|-
| <nowiki>[[UbuntuStudio-TaskMetaPackageContentsSelection|Audio-Video-Graphics package selection]]</nowiki>
| We need to review what we currently ship, and see if there is anything else that needs replacing with something better, removed, or kept.
| LukeYelavich (Taking care of the core desktop), still need one or more people to help with audio/video/graphics seeds.
|-
| <nowiki>[[UbuntuStudio-TaskRecruiting|Recruiting more helpers]]</nowiki>
| This will always be ongoing, but its listed here as it needs to be done.
| ScottLavender
|-
| <nowiki>[[Ubuntustudio-TaskJackIntoMain|Promotion of Jack into main]]</nowiki>
| This requires a <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MainInclusionProcess|Main inclusion report]]</nowiki> to be written for <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libffado|libffado]]</nowiki>. LukeYelavich is happy to provide assistance for anyone who wishes to do this.
| ScottLavender (but will lean heavily on Luke)
|-
| <nowiki>[[UbuntuStudio-TaskUpstreamPackageUpdates|Application update monitoring]]</nowiki>
| We need to know if there any applications that need updating to a new upstream release either from Debian, or upstream directly. Best to talk to the Debian maintainer if there is one to see how soon Debian can be updated. If a package is not updated in Debian by the end of July, we need to consider updating it directly in Ubuntu.
| 
|-
| <nowiki>[[UbuntuStudio-TaskDocumentationMaintenance|Documentation maintenance and co-ordination]]</nowiki>
| Generally a community effort, but it's fallen by the wayside and is an easy way for anyone to help.
| ScottLavender
|-
| <nowiki>[[UbuntuStudio-TaskControlsGtkBuilder|Migrate UbuntuStudio Controls to GtkBuilder]]</nowiki>
| Glade is going to go away upstream, and GtkBuilder is now available in GTK, so we should get ubuntustudio-controls moved to GtkBuilder ASAP.
