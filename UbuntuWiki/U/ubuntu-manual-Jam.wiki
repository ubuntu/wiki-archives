=== Ubuntu Manual Global Jam ===

On the 26th - 28th March 2010 Ubuntu as a whole is holding the Lucid Ubuntu Global Jam, and we're taking part. The purpose of a Global Jam is to fix niggly small bugs in programs. While we will still have bugs, we won't have as many as applications do - so we'll also aim to iron out things in our wiki and Launchpad project page - including blueprints and bugs found there.
