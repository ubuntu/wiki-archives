==== Welcome New Ubuntu Members ====

The approval results from the September 16th Americas Membership meeting are as follows:

* David E. Rondon

* https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Emerling
* https://launchpad.net/~emerling

David has been using Ubuntu since back in 2005, but really got into the Lo``Co around '07. He's helped organize more than 20 local successful events in Venezuela, and recently started to put together a new regional Lo``Co. In the future, he plans to continue with his heavy involvement in organizing events and increase translations of the Wayuunaiki language. His application came with strong support from other Lo``Co members.

==== Ubuntu Open Week, request for instructors ====

Here at Ubuntu we love to give training sessions over IRC. Since Developer and App Developer Week cover the more advanced end of the spectrum we have something for normal users -- Ubuntu Open Week: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuOpenWeek

If you look at the last schedule you'll see that there's still some pretty development focused sessions there:
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MeetingLogs/openweekLucid

I am looking for instructors, specifically those of you who have never taught a class before. Now that developer week is separate, we have some leeway to make these sessions more productive for end users, so I'm looking for some more end-user type questions. So, if you're interested in helping out by teaching a session dive into the prep page: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuOpenWeek/Prep and submit your ideas!

As always, if your Local Team wants to run a concurrent Open Week in your own native language feel free to branch from this wiki page and arrange something, please let me know so I can help get the word out.

=== Ubuntu App Developer Week ===

Just a reminder that Ubuntu App Developer Week begins on Monday, September 27th and ends on Friday, October 1st, 2010.  The line up of sessions proves to be as great as past sessions.  These session will run from 1400 UTC to 2000 UTC daily during the last week of September.

For more information on how you can participate in Ubuntu App Developer Week as well as what sessions are happening and who is leading those sessions please go to:

==== Archive frozen for preparation of Ubuntu 10.10 ====

On Thursday, September 16th Robbie Williamson announced:

We are two weeks out from the 10.10 release candidate and a little over 3 weeks from the final release, so as many of you have probably already noticed, the archive is now frozen and will not thaw again before release.

During the freeze, all uploads to main must be approved by a member of the release team, so if you have fixes that are important to get in and will need discussion, please do get in touch as soon as possible. Uploads to main should at this point focus on release-critical bugs only.

The list of release-critical bugs that we want to still try to resolve before the release candidate on September 30 is tracked here:

 https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/maverick/+bugs?field.milestone=27462

Additional bugs that are still considered "targets of opportunity" for the release are found at:

 https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/maverick/+bugs

==== Fixing Community Processes ====

Jono Bacon writes - Recently a few people have shared stories with me about how they have run up against processes that felt too complex or overly formal, processes that they feel have got in the way of the just do it philosophy that runs deep in the Free Software culture.

My view has always been pretty simple here: the whole point of processes is to organize creativity in ways that (a) reduce confusion (b) optimize collaboration and output, and particularly in Free Software, (c) maintain transparency.

The challenge with projects such as Ubuntu is that our community is huge, and encompasses many different teams, each with their own processes. With this kind of scale it is almost impossible to do a process sanity check with any kind of regularity. As such, we really rely on a Find It And Fix It approach to things. In other words, if you feel a process is to complicated or formalized and actually makes collaboration less attractive, then we need to take a step back, review the process, and improve it.

The underlying moral of this story is – if you come up against a process that is sub-optimal, we should never, and I mean never, ever, ever, ever just say “well, that is the process and that is how it works”.

==== Reflections on Ubuntu, Canonical and the march to free software adoption ====

Prompted in part by the critique of Canonical’s code contributions to the kernel and core GNOME infrastructure, Mark has been pondering whether or not he feels good about what he does every day and how it's done. He talks about his motivation for working on Ubuntu and some of the project's achievements. It's quite a motivational post and worth a read.

==== Alternative UDS Accomodation ====

Ubuntu folk will soon be flocking to Florida in the United States for the next Ubuntu Developer Summit. Some people have been fortunate enough to receive sponsorship from Canonical, while others are sponsored by another organisation or are being self-sponsored. Martin has put together details for people who are arranging their own accommodation to make things easier for non-sponsored people to attend.

http://doctormo.org/2010/09/16/alternative-uds-accommodation/

==== Ubuntu Cowntdown 10.10 ====

The countdown banners for Ubuntu 10.10 are now up. This time, they don’t require Java``Script and thus work fine even on Word``Press.com blogs. With only 20 days left to release, now is a good time to add them to your site!

==== Canonical Design Blog: This week in design – 17 September 2010 ====

This week the big news was all about closure as the final freeze on the desktop for 10.10 is now upon us. This means that we enter a period of bug fixing and the focus of design work shifts more towards 11.04 as we start to prepare for UDS in October... We’ve also been working on the t-shirts for 10.10 to be handed out at UDS – but more on these and an exciting shirt related project soon.

==== Ubuntu 10.10 moves towards completion ====

=== In The Blogosphere ===

==== Belinda Lopez: Getting to the ‘aha’ moments for kids and computers ====

We’ve created a generation that is a great consumer of technology but we’re not enabling them with the right tools and skills to help them move from simple consumers to developers of that and even newer technology. Belinda asks whether you can remember the first time you had that 'aha' moment where you first realized that you can make your computer do new things, and whether we should do something to give kids today that same opportunity.

==== Ed Hewitt: Dropbox vs Ubuntu One ====

On Ubuntu, the two main file syncing services available are Dropbox and Ubuntu One. Ed has been bouncing between these two services since Ubuntu One was released last year. Dropbox has been around since 2007, and has been the leader in this market. Ed decided to write up a a review of both services to compare how they stack up against each other.

http://www.edhewitt.co.uk/2010/09/15/dropbox-vs-ubuntu-one/

==== Ubuntu One Evolves for Maverick ====

Christopher Tozzi, Works``With``U, looks at the improvements to Ubuntu One in Ubuntu 10.10.
Ubuntu One, Canonical’s file-sharing service that has until now been little more than a Dropbox copycat, has evolved for Maverick Meerkat in ways that finally help set it apart from its competitors.  Here’s a look at some of the updates to the service, and what they infer about Canonical’s longterm plans.

Traditionally, Ubuntu One has done little more than allow users to store data in the cloud and automatically sync it between different computers.  Ubuntu 10.04 added a few new features to the service, like syncing Firefox bookmarks, but in general there’s been little to distinguish Ubuntu One from competitors like Dropbox–other than the latter’s cross-platform support, which Ubuntu One lacked until now.

==== Unity Netbook Interface Debuts for Ubuntu 10.10 ====

Christopher Tozzi,Works``With``U writes - It’s been a while since we last took a look at Unity, the new version of Ubuntu customized for netbooks.  A lot has changed since then, however, so it’s time for some updates on how the desktop environment is evolving.

We first blogged about Unity when Canonical introduced it back in May.  We made some unfair conclusions at that time, failing to appreciate the extent to which the interface was still in development.

=== In Other News ===

==== Canonical announces provisional Ubuntu Developer Summit tracks ====

Canonical Ltd., the commercial sponsor of Ubuntu, unveiled the a list of provisional tracks for the Ubuntu Developer Summit (UDS) scheduled for October 25-29, 2010 in Orlando, Florida.

To be confirmed, along with more announced, in coming weeks, the tracks were made available today on the newly-launched UDS site. The site is a destination for information about the event for the key participants in Ubuntu's development, from Canonical engineers and community members to ISVs and partners.

==== A Canonical Controversy ====

Mark Shuttleworth’s blog was added into Planet Gnome after he made a request for it to be added. Why is this a controversy? Mainly because some people want blogs that are featured on Planet Gnome to be from authors that are active in the Gnome community and to actually blog about Gnome as a topic. If Canonical’s contributions to Gnome are being called into question (as evident from the links in closing thoughts below) then what results is a controversial decision for Mark’s blog to be added in.

==== Why Red Hat should fear Amazon Linux ====

While Red Hat's leadership in the enterprise Linux market is without question, the cloud tells a different story altogether. Red Hat's cloud strategy has thus far focused too narrowly on customer retention, opening significant opportunities for Ubuntu to gain traction in the cloud -- and gain traction it has, according to EC2 cloud market statistics.

==== Bazaar team: want to work on Bazaar? ====

We’re looking for a very good software engineer to join the Bazaar team at Canonical, working both on the core tool itself and on how it’s used by Ubuntu developers. We would love to get more applications from people with packaging or distro experience. I want to work with someone who’s very driven, who’ll reach out to their users and not wait to be told what to do, someone who knows the whole environment we work in, and someone who cares about doing good things.
