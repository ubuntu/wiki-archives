A link is provided for those interested, with a clue that a lot more sponsorship money is required for this event than in recent years.

==== Call for testing: ubuntu-frame, mir-kiosk, mir-test-tools, egmde ====

Alan Griffiths tells us new snaps are available for ubuntu-frame, mir-kiosk, and mir-test-tools that use the latest Mir release (2.9.0). We are invited to help test them, and given the command to use the candidate version. We are told a known issue exists with wpe-webkit-mir-kiosk which has been reported to the maintainer, so its fix can be packaged. These apps are expected to be released in a week, however if the wpe-webkit-mir-kiosk fix is in progress it may be delayed slightly to accommodate that.

==== Canonical, Microsoft Bring Ubuntu on Arm to Azure ====

Paul Thurrott writes that Canonical and Microsoft have announced Ubuntu images on Ampere Altra Arm-based Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines are now available. We are told these images provide an "Azure-optimized kernel and configuration" to the Ubuntu experience, with a link to the Ubuntu blog for more details. Details of what Ampere Altra is are given, and some use-cases for where it's useful are discussed.

==== Kylin: The multiple semi-official Chinese versions of Ubuntu ====

Liam Proven writes about Kylin. With most Linux R&D money in the western world being server only, effort in China is being spent on desktops; partially because of the Chinese government's program to reduce dependency on foreign OSes. Mention is made of Deepin and Ubuntu-DDE, before moving to Kylin and the Ubuntu Kylin User Interface (UKUI). There is also some talk of Open``Kylin, before Liam moves to discussing Ubuntu Kylin, and the two versions: one from Ubuntu servers (international), the other being Chinese Ubuntu Kylin Pro. A short review of each is provided in this lengthy post.

==== Chrome extensions with 1.4M installs covertly track visits and inject code ====

Dan Goodin tells us that Google has removed browser extensions from the Play Store, because Mc``Afee "researchers reported they were surreptitiously tracking users’ browsing history and inserting tracking code into specific ecommerce sites they visited". A list of these removed extensions is provided, so you can check your systems to ensure you don't have any installed. Let this be a reminder that extensions can be malicious and that you should exercise discipline when installing them.

==== Microsoft is Investigating Azure Outage Affecting Ubuntu VMs ====

Rabia Noureen reports that "Microsoft has acknowledged that customers may experience domain name system (DNS) issues whilst accessing some Azure cloud services". This was impacting users who used Ubuntu 18.04 on Azure VMs. We are told when the outage started, with a fix for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters being released. Further there are recommendations from Microsoft to get around unhealthy services, which include rebooting (get new DHCP lease) & disabling automatic security updates until the issue is fully resolved.

Here Michael gives focus to Feral Interactive's Game``Mode that controls the CPU frequency scaling governor's performance. While Game``Mode has been available as a Debian package, work is underway to transition it to a Snap. Michael concludes stating: "We'll see how these ongoing Linux gaming improvements for Ubuntu pan out moving forward".
