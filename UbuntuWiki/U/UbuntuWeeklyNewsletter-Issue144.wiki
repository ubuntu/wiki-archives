==== Tutorial of The Week ====

Mon June 1st, 2009.

This week, we step again out of the Tutorial & Tips section of the forums, to highlight psyke83's (http://ubuntuforums.org/member.php?u=50843) gigantic How``To: Jaunty Intel Graphics Performance Guide. Intel graphic hardware is quite popular and Intel drivers code has been extensively developed. Jaunty has some problems with the latest Intel drivers or acceleration method. You can choose one of the three proposed methods, from safe, to optimal and the always risky bleeding edge.

We hope this will help you with Intel video chips, please feel free to post your questions in the thread, psyke83 is actively supporting his tutorial.

http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1130582

See you next week !

==== Ubuntu One New Sub-Forum ====

There is now a place to discuss Ubuntu One on the forums and it can be found here: http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=367.
From the main page, you can access it under the main Support Categories.

=== In The Press ===

==== Android Applications on Ubuntu ====

The Linux Loop reports from the Ubuntu Developer’s Summit where the plans for Karmic Koala should be roughly defined for implementation over the next four months. One of the things that was discussed is support for running Android applications on Ubuntu. This is an interesting possibility, since it could allow for a vast library of interesting applications designed for mobile use to be used on Ubuntu computers, and most importantly those running Ubuntu Netbook Remix. Android stands a chance of really taking off, due to its open-source foundation and powerful backing from Google. There will undoubtedly be a huge library of incredible applications, both free and for pay, that will make the Android experience what it is. If Android applications could be run directly on Ubuntu, that would give Ubuntu a boost from whatever attention Android gets. http://www.linuxloop.com/news/2009/05/25/android-applications-on-ubuntu/

==== Dell Studio XPS 13: Now With Ubuntu 8.10 ====

The Linux Loop notes that Dell has begun shipping their Studio XPS 13 with Ubuntu 8.10. It's interesting that instead of listing the Ubuntu version only on the special Ubuntu page, Ubuntu is an option, like with Dell’s netbooks, on the normal Studio XPS 13 page. This is great, since it means that Dell is putting Ubuntu where more people will see it. It’s good to see another computer from Dell offered with Ubuntu. http://www.linuxloop.com/news/2009/05/24/dell-studio-xps-13-now-with-ubuntu-810/

==== Canonical support ====

Yann Hamon of Oxford Archaeology reports that they've been paying customers of Canonical support for almost a year, and he takes a look back to see if it was worth it, what worked well, and what could be improved. Hamon says, "We purchased support from Canonical to ensure that our road will never be blocked by an unsurmountable bug - and to know that we have a company guaranteeing that the software we deploy will actually work as expected, and that commits itself to fixing it if it doesn't." Hamon reports that the support quality is pretty good. He usually gets an answer the next day, and the people there are friendly and qualified. Not-so-basic questions on how to use the systems are answered quickly and in a professional manner. "I am globally very satisfied with the level of support I am getting - I know I have a bunch of very capable people who would help me whenever I got a question, or who would spend time fixing a bug for me - which is something I may sometimes not be able to do myself." http://blogs.thehumanjourney.net/oaubuntu/entry/canonical_support

==== Review: System76 Pangolin Performance laptop ====

Jack of ghacks.net reviews the System76 Pangolin Performance laptop, and he admits that when the boxes arrived from System76 he was naturally sceptical. "The last Linux-based laptop I reviewed showed some promise until very quickly the weakness of the hardware reared its ugly head. Fortunately, with the Pangolin Performance, I was happily surprised." Jack feels that the user can be confident that what they purchase from System76 will work for them and work well. The elegant combination of Ubuntu 9.04 and the graceful look and feel of the Pangolin Performance laptop make a combination you can not go wrong with. "Of all the Linux-based hardware companies I have ever dealt with, System76 gets the highest recommendation I could offer." http://www.ghacks.net/2009/05/26/review-system76-pangolin-performance-laptop/

==== More Details on Ubuntu One Integration ====

The Linux Loops notes that the Ubuntu Developer Summit for Karmic Koala has given us a few more details on its integration with Karmic Koala. There are plans to include at least the main requirements for the Ubuntu One software in Karmic. The more interesting part is what Ubuntu One might be able to do. There is apparently some discussion about address book synchronization, which seems quite logical. There are also mentions of syncing Tomboy notes, syncing bookmarks, and backing up flash drives. The details on Ubuntu One’s real uses are still emerging, but it looks like it has the potential to be a really useful service and more than a Dropbox clone. http://www.linuxloop.com/news/2009/05/29/more-details-on-ubuntu-one-integration/

==== Linux New Media Launches Ubuntu User Magazine ====

Linux Magazine reports that Canonical's popular Ubuntu operating system continues to win followers around the world, and Ubuntu User is the first print magazine specifically for this rapidly growing audience. "Ubuntu is popular with software developers and IT professionals, but it is also a hit with hobbyists and other desktop users who are looking for an alternative to Microsoft Windows and don't want the restrictive hardware policies of Apple," says Joe Casad, Editor in Chief of Ubuntu User. In addition to reviews, interviews, community news, How``To articles, troubleshooting tips, and in-depth technical articles, Ubuntu User includes a helpful Discovery Guide for readers who are new to the world of Ubuntu. A free DVD included with each issue of Ubuntu User provides an easy way for users to upgrade to the latest version. Linux New Media CEO Brian Osborn said, “Ubuntu is popular around the world, and it's a great fit for us editorially. I couldn't imagine a better match." Ubuntu community members Mike Basinger and Nick Ali have also contributed to Ubuntu User magazine, which is shipping now to news-stands worldwide. http://www.linux-magazine.com/online/news/linux_new_media_launches_ubuntu_user_magazine

=== In The Blogosphere ===

==== Canonical Begins Ubuntu Server Edition Training ====

Blogger Joe Panettieri from Works``With``U gives us an update on what is happening with the Ubuntu Server Edition Training program. He spoke with Billy Cina, Canonical's Training Programmes Manager, and she told him, "We had the first beta run of the server course and it went very well." Panettieri also inquired with Cina if they will be introducing training for Landscape and was told, "Landscape is part of the Ubuntu Certified Professional and Server courses." Cina also noted that Canonical and the Linux Professional Institute (LPI) are offering a special promotion on Ubuntu exams. Ubuntu 9.04 has been tested to run on 45 different server configurations from Dell, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Lenovo, Sun Microsystems and other server makers, notes Canonical CEO Mark Shuttleworth. Canonical is also expected to announce a closer working relationship with the HP Pro``Liant server team within weeks. http://www.workswithu.com/2009/05/27/canonical-begins-ubuntu-server-edition-training/

==== Canonical’s Ubuntu to Support Google Android? ====

Blogger Joe Panettieri from Works``With``U informs us of Canonical's netbook team's plan to show Google Android applications running on Ubuntu during the Ubuntu Developer Summit. Google Android now runs on 1 million to 2 million smart phones and other mobile devices, estimates Newsfactor, and Strategy Analytics predicts that sales will grow 900 percent in 2009 vs. 2008. Android will be a key topic of discussion at UDS — an event where Canonical and attendees will focus mainly on Ubuntu 9.10 (Karmic Koala) development goals. According to an Ubuntu Lo``Co Team member who plans to attend UDS, at least three sessions at the Barcelona event will focus on Android compatibility and strategies. Adds a source close to Canonical, referring to the Ubuntu-Android work: “We’ll share some screen shots/demos [at UDS]. I have no comment on it though — it’s just something we’re playing around with, which is what UDS is about.” http://www.workswithu.com/2009/05/24/canonical-ubuntu-to-support-google-android/

==== Linux Netbook Reviews: What The Wall Street Journal Missed ====

Joe Panettieri of Works``With``U presents his option of the Wall Street Journal's review of multiple Linux netbooks running Ubuntu, Mi, and Moblin Linux. "Overall, I think the review offers fair, balanced coverage of what’s right — and wrong — with the Linux netbook market today." The Journal made some fair points, noting that the Linux netbooks had compatibility problems with external devices. What concerns Panettieri is the statement, "Since a Windows XP version of the Dell Mini 10 sells for the same price as the Ubuntu, I can’t see a compelling reason to choose the Ubuntu option." Panettieri feels that this statement is short sighted, and argues that the total cost of ownership for system running Ubuntu is much lower than one running Windows XP. "I’ve run Ubuntu on desktops, notebooks and netbooks with Open``Office for two years. And I can’t recall experiencing a security headache or paying for security software. Too bad the Journal overlooked this TCO issue." http://www.workswithu.com/2009/05/28/linux-netbook-reviews-what-the-wall-street-journal-missed/

==== Ubuntu AppStore in the workings ? ====

Stefano Forenza says that we live in some cool times. "Everybody’s up creating an App``Store of some kind. After Apple brought out the concept, Nokia, Microsoft and even Sun are hurrying up putting together their ones." Many Open Source supporters have noted again and again, as have many Mac users, that Linux repositories are pretty much the equivalent of an App``Store. There’s some ground to fill, as Apple's App``Store has some end user features that Linux equivalents lack. Forenza tells us that a Launchpad blueprint for a project codenamed App``Center has been taken in consideration and the related wiki page has been given some attention during the past months. Canonical employee Matthew Paul Thomas commented, "This is a multi-release project. Our goal is to have a version 1.0 of the application ready to feature in Ubuntu 9.10, but exactly how much it will do remains to be seen." http://www.stefanoforenza.com/ubuntu-appstore-in-the-workings/

==== ZaReason Preparing Ubuntu Server, Netbook ====

Joe Panetteri of Works``With``U relays recent conversations with Za``Reason CEO Cathy Malmrose about the European expansion, a new tower server model, netbook, and the new Partimus initiative. Malrose relates an overall approval from the Za``Reason customer base for the Ubuntu 9.04 release, with only minor problems mostly relating to Flash.  Malrose describes the new Partimus pathway, "I can announce our current initiative — we are setting up the framework for Partimus (which means “we share” in Latin) to function as a donation center to connect nearly new laptops and desktops with new owners who can show obvious need for the assistance. The Partimus CTO, Maile Urbancic, helps run university housing at the University of California at Berkeley and through her work she has seen many impoverished students, especially graduate students, who would benefit greatly from a laptop that could help them through a few years of school. "On my side, I have seen inventory go unused, depreciating every day that it sits on our shelves. Laptops that are used for shows, demo models and other lightly used systems can be donated to people who could put them to good use." Za``Reason official announcements for the tower server and the netbook are forthcoming, as well as the Partimus branch for gently used systems. Thank you Joe Paneterri for opening a window into the future of Za``Reason. http://www.workswithu.com/2009/05/27/zareason-preparing-ubuntu-server-netbook/
