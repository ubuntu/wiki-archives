==== IX Aniversario de ubuntu-ve ====

David Emerling Rondón shares details and photos from the ubuntu-ve (Venezuela) 9th anniversary of the team. He writes that due to planning difficulties for anniversaries in the past, he changed the plans this year. “Rather than perform a single event, a single day; I called each group to participate in the same locality, extending opportunities to other members. [A]s a result two groups were nominated. [A]nd two groups are being planned.” Links from this post are in Spanish.

==== UbuConLA 2015 reports ====

José Antonio Rey looks back at the two day UbuConLA event which took place in Lima, Peru on 7th and 8th August, noting that over 100 people turned up on the first day. José writes about the sessions, the speakers, other people he met there, and the food. In his conclusion, he says, ”You all, the Ubuntu community, are the reason why I organized the event, as well as the reason why I'm still around. Since I joined you've been like a second family, welcomed me with open arms, and now here we are. Please, keep being awesome.”

Elizabeth K. Joseph also attended the event and notes that her keynote “Building a Career in Free and Open Source Software,” which was delivered in English, was probably understood by the majority due to the audience reaction and her use of bilingual slides. She also runs through the various sessions and shows us some photographs taken while at the event.

Videos of the sessions, which are mainly in Spanish, can be found at the Ubuntu on Air! channel, specifically on the UbuConLA+ 2015 playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-qBHd6_LXWb7HcFQAmfY1eDu0YaYxl4C

==== Ubuntu's Deb-Based Software Center Fails As An App Store ====

Michael Larabel of Phoronix writes that some app developers are unhappy with Canonical’s handling of the Ubuntu Software Center for paid apps. He relays the concerns of Michal Rosiak, a Polish app developer, who says that his games are not being made available to users running Ubuntu 14.10 and 15.04. Larabel quotes several sources which acknowledge the problem, and Martin Albisetti is quoted as saying, “Our last push was to make sure the LTS was supported, we hired an extra person to keep the review queue down to a handful of packages at any time (vs 100s) and we've addressed critical bugs as they came up.”
