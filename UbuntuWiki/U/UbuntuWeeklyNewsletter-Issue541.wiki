=== In the Blogosphere ===

==== Pitivi Video Editor Gains UI Polish, Video Preview Resizing ====

Joey Sneddon reports on improvements to the Pitivi app through the Google Summer of Code event. These include changes and additions to the welcome dialog and support for slow motion videos. Joey advises that the improvements are expected in the next stable release and shares screenshots and links to sources.

https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2018/08/pitivi-video-editor-gsoc-2018

==== Linux 4.18 Arrives With Some Big Changes ====

Joey Sneddon reports on the latest stable kernel release, delayed due to some pending minor updates. Though the code base is reduced overall by 100K, support has been added for new hardware, particularly new video drivers and sound chips. Of note is the inclusion of a reverse-engineered Steam Controller driver. Joey lists some of the many features of the release and provides links for greater details.

https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2018/08/linux-4-18-kernel-release-features

==== EXT4 & XFS File-System Updates Submitted For Linux 4.19 ====

Michael Larabel tells us of Linux 4.19 kernel changes being made. For ext4, documentation found on the project's wiki has been converted into files in the kernel tree, the time stamp found in the superblock fields is now 64bit, the file system has been hardened against corruption and other improvements and fixes. Changes with XFS involve some IOMAP refactoring to remove buffer heads though more changes to XFS are expected before 4.19 is released.

https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=EXT4-XFS-Linux-4.19

==== Big CIFS/SMB3 Improvements Head To Linux 4.19 ====

Michael Larabel updates us on significant patches improving the CIFS/SMB3 support provided in the 4.19 kernel. Updates include improved tracing and stats, snapshots to support previous version mounts over SMB3 as well as security and performance upgrades. Michael notes there is support for ACLs in SMB 3.11, providing the Git pull link for more details. Finally it is noted the GFS2 Linux cluster file-system has IOMAP support for buffered writes or direct I/O in 4.19.

==== Libinput 1.12 RC2 Continues Working On Improving Linux Touchpad Behavior ====

Michael Larabel gives an update for the upcoming Libinput 1.12 release. Along with finishing the documentation are improved scroll detection, blocking of finger motion, and better palm detection in the input handling tweaks. More details are in the provided announcement link.

https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Libinput-1.12-RC2-Released

==== Mesa 18.2-RC3 Released With Two Dozen Fixes ====

Michael Larabel advises that Mesa 18.2-RC3 is now available for testing. This release has various driver patches, Wayland fixes, updates to the multiple build systems, and the Metro Redux fix. He provides a roadmap to the final of Mesa 18.2.0 and advises that 18.3 feature update is on Git master.

https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Mesa-18.2-RC3-Released

==== Ubuntu, Debian, RHEL, and CentOS Linux Now Patched Against "Foreshadow" Attacks ====

Marius Nestor writes about a new Spectre-like flaw which affects Intel x86 CPUs called L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF) or Foreshadow which has now been patched. The flaw is documented in various CVEs which Marius notes providing some detail on it. Marius advises us to patch our systems including Ubuntu 12.04 ESM, 14.04 LTS, 16.04 LTS, and 18.04 LTS, and use the most recent microcode firmware.

https://news.softpedia.com/news/ubuntu-debian-rhel-and-centos-linux-now-patched-against-foreshadow-attacks-522335.shtml

==== KDE Applications 18.08 Open-Source Software Suite Released ====

Marius Nestor informs us that the KDE Application 18.08 software suite is out and stable. He draws much attention to the Gwenview image viewer which has lots of new features, but doesn't forget Konsole, KMail, Akonadi and other programs which too have new features and bug fixes. We are told this release will have 3-4 months of support and enhancements, ending when 18.12 is released late this year. Finally Marius provides many screenshots of the updated programs.

==== Lubuntu Planning Switch To Wayland, Porting Openbox To Mir ====

Michael Larabel reminds us that Lubuntu will be using the LXQt desktop environment, but notes we may not know that they have laid out plans to use Wayland instead of X.Org. To achieve this they intend to port the Openbox window manager to use the Mir display server. Because this change will take some time, it's not expected until the Lubuntu 20.10 release.

https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Lubuntu-Openbox-Mir-Wayland

==== Mir Has Partial Support For The NVIDIA Proprietary Driver, X11 Support Remains WIP ====

Michael Larabel tells us that the team working on the Mir display server have continued adding features to it, the latest being partial support for the NVIDIA proprietary driver. Currently OpenGL clients won't work but they continue working towards that goal. Michael notes Mir has support for the XDG Shell stable protocol, with more Wayland extension protocols being worked on.

https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Mir-Partial-NVIDIA-Support

==== Wayland 1.16 / Weston 5.0 RC2 Released To Fix Vulnerabilities ====

Michael Larabel reports that an unscheduled release candidate has been issued for both Wayland and Weston. They address pointer overflows within Wayland's connection code and the compositor's keyboard mapping corrupting. The release candidates are available for testing while the final releases are expected next week.
