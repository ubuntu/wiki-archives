__TOC__

== PHASE ==

The project under heavy development. It does not yet have a working demo.

== Purpose ==

The simplest explanation of purpose is likely what was discussed between two of the developers.

23:28 <doctormo> what will it be used for?
23:29 <MTecknology> Lemme draw a timeline in slow people typing...
23:37 <MTecknology>
** 1) Asked about a Lo``Co Map
** 2) I look into it
** 3) Really irritated with wiki page format
** 4) I start drawing up code to clean that shit-pile up
** 5) I decide we need something better and agree with the requests
** 6) I start working on it
** 7) I start looking for help because the fucker is massive
** 8) There you are...
** 9) We work together for a while
** 10) You take over much of the coding
** 11) I move over to work on the UD Planet module
** 12) You do one hell of a kick ass job [ We had our different opinions in the mix ]
** 13) You develop another map to zoom in that is royally kick ass
** 14) We stop while waiting to get the XML data
** 15) Somewhere in there the LD guys thought it would be great if we finished this
** 16) They finally give us XML output
** 17) I try to pick this up again
** 18) I grab code from you
** 19) I'm swamped but have other people that want to help
** 20) I develop specs for them to follow. .......
** 21) Project finished.
** 22) You developed it in a highly portable manner that we maintain
** 23) I deliver to LoCo Directory guys
** 24) They spend 15min making it work with the LD instead
** 25) It exists for everyone.

The goal of this Ubuntu Drupal module is to present all of the LoCo information on a map. A model can be seen <nowiki>[[ http:--divajutta.com-doctormo-locomap-usa-locomap-fill.svg | here ]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[ http:--divajutta.com-doctormo-locomap-map.svg | here ]]</nowiki>.

This has been a massive project for some time in the community and nobody has yet to provide a fully functional and ready to deploy system. It's time to finally have this running in the wild.

== Specifications ==

/!\ Review Needed

## This will exist as a Drupal module
### The map must be displayable as a page that is returned as content (map + theme shown) [provided it's feasible]
### The map must be displayable as a page that is printed (only map shown)
## The administrator must be able to specify dynamic options such as:
### The color for:
#### Non-Existing Lo``Cos
#### Non-Approved Lo``Cos
#### Approved Lo``Cos
#### Defaults should be pulled from the SVG Concept
### The highest level map
### The data location (http://loco.ubuntu.com/data/xml)
### The images location (Unknown)
### A button to force retrieving of remote data
## Remote information should be pulled from remote location on cron()
### The cron function will not run more than once every 24 hours
#### Unless forced
### The data will be checked fore timestamp differences before being fetched
#### New timestamp will not be saved until the parse completes successfully
### After retrieving; the data will be parsed and printed to a local file
#### This file will be formatted so no additional parsing operations need to occur
### No remote data will need to be pulled. Except:
#### Current Lo``Co data from the Lo``Co Directory
### Any data needed will need to exist locally in a format ready for the map 
## The map will start in a predefined "highest level map" (Ex. North America)
### The user <!> {will / will not} be able to go out beyond this level
### The user will be able to zoom in until data exists for a detailed overview
### In the detailed overview: users will see outlined areas for each Lo``Co.
### Hovering over the area will highlight the area
### Clicking the area will bring up a box with information about the Lo``Co in that highlighted area
### The box will contain: (if available)
#### Flag or Image
##### https://launchpad.net/api/beta/~<LP_TEAM>/mugshot
##### Some method to use a link to LP Team Image would be best for this
#### Lo``Co Name
##### <!> Possibly a note about if they are officially approved or not
##### <!> Possibly a note about if they provide local support
#### Link to Website
#### Link to Forums
#### Link to Wiki
#### Link to Mailing List
#### Link to IRC Channel (webchat.freenode.net)
#### Link to Launchpad Page
#### [ Above order should likely be followed. ]
## The map will have RTL CSS wherever appropriate
## The code will be CLEAN and READABLE
## THIS CODE MUST BE HIGHLY PORTABLE
### It will not remain as a Drupal project
### It will be expanded and partially absorbed into the LoCo Directory project
## The user must be alerted if they need to enabled javascript
## The user must be alerted if they need to obtain SVG support
## {i} Technologies to be used:
### Open``Layers provides an existing set of tools for working with maps
#### The work could be somewhat reproduced on this
#### To achieve the eye-candy already existing would make much of the existing framework pointless
### SVG provides all the functionality we need
#### A large part of this work is finished by doctormo
#### Provides very nice eye-candy
#### The new mechanism is much nicer to older browsers with older video cards
### Google Maps would be best suited for "pins" which is not a part of this project
