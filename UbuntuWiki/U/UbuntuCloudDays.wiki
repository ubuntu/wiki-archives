/server irc.freenode.net
</pre>

Then join #ubuntu-classroom for the time and date of the session you want to attend. You can manually join the channel by typing: {{{
/join #ubuntu-classroom}}}

You should also join `#ubuntu-classroom-chat` which is the general discussion channel for the session. Questions should be posted there. You should prefix your questions with '''QUESTION:''' to make them easier to spot.

Most sessions last for around an hour. Contact `kim0` on IRC if you have any problems.

For instructions on how to use the various IRC clients, see <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/XChatHowto|XChatHowto]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Irssi|Irssi]]</nowiki>, respectively.
