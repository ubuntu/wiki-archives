=== Introduction ===

Times and dates are displayed in various locations in Launchpad. Currently they are generally displayed in UTC, but it would be nice to display them in local time. When users are entering times, interpreting them as local time may also reduce errors.

In other parts, it may be necessary to store a time value with its associated time zone.
