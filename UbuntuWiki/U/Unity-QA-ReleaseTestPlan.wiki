__TOC__

This document references the series of tests that need to be conducted prior to a release of Unity.

=== Process ===

* Monday 9am CET - The Unity trunk is frozen on Monday, to prepare for a release on Thursday
* Monday - From there, the merge policy is restricted to clear bug fixes (identified with bugs)
** Further, merges are limited to fixes for errors blocking the release, ie regressions or release critical priorities
** Engineers and testers install the PPA packages for Unity and companion components to perform smoke testing (see below)
** QA Enginers verify the test coverage for fixes or changes on the release list: each bug should either be covered by a new manual test or by an automated test; bugs without test require a special authorization 
* Tuesday - Formal testing commences
** The QA engineers follow the <nowiki>[[#Test Suite|test suite]]</nowiki> and collect results into a <nowiki>[[XXX spreadsheet link|spreadsheet]]</nowiki>
** Issues are reported in Launchpad and also highlighted on #ubuntu-unity
** Developers prioritize bug analysis and bug fixing over other tasks
* Wednesday - Test results reviewed
** During the desktop weekly meeting, the test results are reviewed with stakeholders
** Release decision based on the results; this may include dropping some patches or fixes, in order to preserve the "releasability" of Unity
** The trunk freeze is lifted
* Thursday - Release window
** Platform reviews the Unity packages according to their release criteria policy
** Didrocks runs the distro-acceptance tests
** Didrocks uploads the new Unity into Ubuntu

See also <nowiki>[[Unity-ReleaseSchedule]]</nowiki> for the weeks and days where a new release of Unity is planned.

=== Test Suite ===

The test suite is composed of:
# Automated unit tests run at build time; those tests don't require a running display; any regression here will stop any further code merges, until the problem is resolved
# Automated user-acceptance tests, run by AutoPilot: run automatically on the PPA packages; unless regressions are identified, the result goes into the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~unity-team/+archive/ppa|unity-team/ppa]]</nowiki>
# The Unity manual test cases, documented in the source tree directly: http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~unity-team/unity/trunk/files/head:/manual-tests/

=== Misc. ===
==== Smoke Testing ====

For reference, is is a shorter smoke testing list, to quickly assess a new package or tarball:
* revealing the launcher
* invoking the Dash with the SUPER key
* looking for an application like 'terminal'
* invoking the application with a mouse click
* switching back and forth between the terminal application and a browser window
* invoking the Dash Files Lens (SUPER-F)
* invoking the Dash Applications Lens (SUPER-A)
* scrubbing the menus on the panel (from the top left to the extreme right)
* reorganizing the set of launcher icons by dragging and dropping a launcher icon on the launcher
* dragging and dropping an application from the Dash onto the launcher
* verifying that the gnome-terminal application has its global menu hosted on the panel, and not in its window
