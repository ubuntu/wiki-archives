==== Full Circle Podcast Episode 28 A Year in Comedy ====

This episode contains fewer facts than usual.

It’s a New Year. It’s January. We’re on something of a break, so that can only mean a cheap, and frankly brain-numbingly lazy, listen back to the year 2011. This could be the best, or worst idea we’ve ever had.

Our thanks to all our co-hosts, guests, correspondents and contributors.

Select brain to ‘neutral’, put your laughing trousers on stand-by and enjoy.
