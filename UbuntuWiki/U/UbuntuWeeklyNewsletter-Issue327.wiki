==== Ubuntu Edge Indiegogo Campaign ====

The Ubuntu Edge Team announces a campaign to raise 32 million dollars to support development of an Ubuntu-based phone. They write: “The Ubuntu Edge is our very own superphone, a catalyst to drive the next generation of personal computing.” The team tells us Ubuntu Edge is an exclusive production run available only through Indiegogo, and all of the funding that is received goes directly towards producing the device for expected delivery in May 2014. They describe the hardware, the software, the rollout plan, and the technical specifications. A number of mock-ups have been released along with a comprehensive FAQ and details of the evolving pledge levels.

=== Ubuntu Cloud News ===

==== Targetted machine deployment with Juju ====

James Page writes that as of the latest release of Juju (available in a PPA and in Ubuntu Saucy), Juju now has native support for specifying to which machine a charm should be deployed. James provides a number of code samples but points out that there are still a few gotchas; charms are running without separation, and not all of the Openstack charms are compatible with the latest version of Juju.

http://javacruft.wordpress.com/2013/07/25/juju-put-it-there-please/

==== JohnJohn -- A Scalable Juju Charm Tutorial ====

==== Sebastian Kügler: the next kubuntu graphics stack ====

Sebastian Kügler discusses the advancements being made on the Kubuntu graphics stack, with particular emphasis on their goal of making Plasma Workspaces 2 compatible in the future. He states that for the foreseeable future Kubuntu will make use of Xorg, with late 2014 bringing support for Plasma Workspaces 2.

==== Nicholas Skaggs: Ubuntu Edge: Convergence in the palm of your hand ====

Nicholas Skaggs writes about his journey to have convergence between his smartphone and desktop, and how the Ubuntu Edge is the realization of that goal. With his smartphone powerful enough to handle most computing tasks and with cloud servers capable of performing longer running tasks, there seems to be no need to have two separate devices. Ubuntu Edge allows him to use a bigger screen and keyboard while at home, yet take it with him and have access to everything he needs.

http://developer.ubuntu.com/2013/07/ubuntu-sdk-beta-released/

==== Victor Palau: Ubuntu Edge: convergence in action ====

Victor Palau writes that although the hardware is getting a lot of the attention, it’s the Ubuntu Edge’s ability to be a phone and a PC that will have the biggest impact. He shows us a quick video to show a few examples of how it has made his working life so much simpler for the two months or more he has been running Ubuntu for Android on a Nexus 4 phone.

http://victorpalau.net/2013/07/26/ubuntu-edge-convergence-in-action/

==== Canonical Design Team: Ubuntu Edge: Design process ====

Chee Wong details the process of designing the Ubuntu Edge. After getting started by expanding on elements in the Suru theme and transitioning to a physical user experience from a digital one, rough ideas were sketched out and improved. Afterward, techniques like model making, 3D CAD, and 3D printing were used to help refine the product to make it what we now have with the Ubuntu Edge.

==== Nicholas Skaggs: An autopilot emulator for ubuntu sdk apps: Part II ====

Nicholas Skaggs gives props to Leo Arias for making the autopilot emulator an official part of the Ubuntu SDK.  He provides a few examples on integrating the emulator with other test cases.

=== In The Press ===

==== Ubuntu vs. Kubuntu ====

Matt Hartley of Datamation shares his experiences of installing Kubuntu. He makes several direct comparisons with Ubuntu noting differences in the applications such as those used for email and web browsing.

==== Ubuntu vs Xubuntu ====
