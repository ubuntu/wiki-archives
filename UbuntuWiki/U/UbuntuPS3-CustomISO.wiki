== Creation of a custom .ISO for the PS3 Ubuntu Port ==

So, here's the deal:

Like regular visitors of #ubuntu-ps3 know, me and other users are planning on creating a custom .ISO with most of things working out of the box. I found this to be a better approach then to release packages of the stable release of linux-cell. This way, users will have a working system since the first boot.

Describe what you done to fix X (where X is the problem) on your PS3 install. This will allow the developers to implement that solution and make it available for the release of this Custom ISO. I expect to have a working version within 1 week (~ 15th of March).
