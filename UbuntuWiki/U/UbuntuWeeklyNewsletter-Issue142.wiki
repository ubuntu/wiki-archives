==== Landscape 1.3 released ====

Landscape is the package that allows server and desktop administrators to maintain Ubuntu on physical, or virtual servers, and to more easily manage their deployments. The new release, Landscape 1.3, also makes that service available to the Amazon EC2 cloud. Landscape is available as part of the commercial support package, or as a stand-alone service. New features in Landscape include:

* Management of Ubuntu on Amazon EC2
* The ability to choose Ubuntu images on Amazon EC2
* Management of physical and virtual machines
* Updated Custom Graph feature

==== Server Team: Hungry for Merges? ====

Ubuntu developers are focusing on merging packages from Debian unstable into karmic repositories.  Those that want to help improve their skills in merging packages, they have a list for both the main and universe repositories that is available.  To get the packages, go to the Ubuntu Merge-O-Matic[1].  The Merging[2] wiki page has more information on the process.  When finished, upload the changes or ask for sponsorship[3] and don't forget to sent the patches to Debian.

=== Mark Shuttleworth ===

==== Meta-cycles: 2-3 year major cycles for free software ====

Mark Shuttleworth is looking for your comments.  Ubuntu has been running on the basis of 6 month releases with LTS every 2 years or so.  But now the question is, "What IS the best way to approach big releases?"  What would be a good period of time for release of significant changes such as KDE made when it moved from the 3.X series to the 4.0 series?  Is 2 years enough?  Is it too much?  Should it even be cycled on a periodic basis, like the Ubuntu releases are currently using?  Mark's blog asks a lot of questions like this, with significant background to amplify what it is that he's asking, and he would like input from the community as to their ideas and reasons why.

==== Tutorial of the Week ====

The tutorial of the week for May 11, 2009, is How``To: Install the very latest MPlayer under Jaunty Jackalope from andrew.46 (http://ubuntuforums.org/member.php?u=208550). You can find it here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1081070 This is a nifty tutorial that will show you how to successfully compile the subversion MPlayer under Jaunty Jackalope.

From the archives, ubuntu-freak's (http://ubuntuforums.org/member.php?u=314581) "Comprehensive Multimedia & Video Howto" was the Tutorial of the Week for October 06, 2008 and should be used if you do not wish to compile applications. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=766683

This week tutorial is very well presented, and, most of all, supported. You can even browse a recent tutorial from the same author, "Top 10 Tricks and Tips for the svn MPlayer" that focuses on MPlayer usage. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1154431

Long hours of fun ahead!

==== Philipp Kern: Infinote-based Gobby hits Karmic ====

Gobby 0.5 (or to be more precise 0.4.92) just hit the Karmic Koala. It is sadly not protocol compatible to the old version but it features local undo and redo! Furthermore it's not yet stable on-the-wire wise. The software itself is fairly stable but it could be a bit bumpy if the server protocol version goes out of date. If you want to try it out on earlier versions, Philipp is offering backports in the Infinote PPA for Intrepid and up. https://launchpad.net/~infinote/+archive/ppa Thanks to Greg Heynes, there will also be a KDE client for Gobby, called... Kobby! http://www.philkern.de/weblog/en/ubuntu/gobby_infinote_hits_karmic.html

==== Ryan Troy: New Ubuntu Forums LoCo Administrator ====

Ryan announces that Joeb454 who has been a staff member on the Ubuntu Forums for quite some time has offered to take over the managing of the Lo``Co sub-forums. The Forum Council gave Joe the big +1’s he needed. We believe Joe will do a great job taking care of the details. So, if you have a Lo``Co forum and need help or need one get with Joe. http://ubuntuforums.org/member.php?u=373057

==== Ubuntu 9.10 Alpha 1 Released - The Karmic Koala Chronicles ====

Softpedia's Marius Nestor says that while everybody is enjoying Ubuntu 9.04 (Jaunty Jackalope), somewhere deep in the Ubuntu headquarters the developers are working hard to bring us all the new stuff that happens in the Linux world today. Ubuntu 9.10, dubbed Karmic Koala, which is scheduled for release in late October this year, was recently uploaded to the official mirrors. As always, Nestor did not expect something exciting from the first, and not even from the next two or three alpha versions of Ubuntu. Probably starting with the fifth or sixth alpha we will see some big changes, like that professional theme everyone is still waiting for, and which Mark Shuttleworth promised us.

==== Xubuntu: A Simple Approach To Ubuntu ====

Linux.com's Rob Reilly says he's always liked Kubuntu but now that he's back doing freelance work again, tweaking the very cool resident desktop features all the time was beginning to distract him from pursuing fame and fortune as a humble word-smith. Having heard that the xfce desktop was simple and light, it seemed reasonable to try to speed up his article production with a streamlined process. Reilly found that for the new Linux user, Xubuntu is an easy to use version of Ubuntu that is fast, simple, and reliable. Experienced or "get it done" types will appreciate the minimalist approach, that can be beefed up to whatever degree that is needed.

==== Next Ubuntu Alpha reveals video change ====

The next Ubuntu should see improved video performance, along with updates to the underlying Linux and open-source infrastructure. Ubuntu 9.10 will feature a new Intel video driver architecture to solve problems in Ubuntu 9.04, released just last month. Ubuntu 9.10 will switch from the current EXA acceleration method to UXA. A kernel-mode setting, meanwhile, will reduce video mode switching flicker during start up and - the team said - "dramatically" speed up the suspend and resume time.

==== Building Applications Using Ubuntu One ====

Stuart Langridge, a hacker, author, and speaker living in the UK and working for Canonical building online services, says that Ubuntu One is not just a collection of services for Ubuntu, it’s a platform that you can build your own services on. Stuart Langridge explains some of the APIs that Ubuntu One offers to developers, what they do, and how you can make use of them. You’ll see some examples of applications you might want to build that take advantage of data storage in the cloud and automatically-synchronised database backing for your apps, and you’ll get a glimpse of how to build programs to help people work collaboratively through Ubuntu One both on the desktop and on the web.

==== Ubuntu One: Free Online Storage ====

Daniel Pop-Silaghi, Linux Editor for Softpedia, reports that Canonical has just released a new "cloud" service for all users: Ubuntu One. If you are familiar with services like Dropbox, Ubuntu One apparently does the same job. The main features are seamless integration and synchronization between multiple machines and a convenient web interface. But, while Dropbox works across all main platforms, the Ubuntu One application will exclusively be available for Ubuntu 9.04 operating systems. Ubuntu One is surely a service worth watching, and Pop-Silagh says he's sure Canonical has some aces up its sleeve to make its new project much more appealing than the competition.

http://news.softpedia.com/news/Ubuntu-One-Free-Online-Storage-111347.shtml

==== Ubuntu 9.04 vs Mac OS X 10.5.6 Benchmarks ====

Phoronix's Michael Larabel recalls that last year when he looked at Ubuntu versus Mac OS X both operating systems had performed competitively. Since then Apple has released a minor update to Leopard (v10.5.6) and Canonical last month released Ubuntu 9.04 so he felt it was time to compare these latest releases against each other. In looking over these results, Apple's Mac OS X 10.5.6 was faster than Canonical's Ubuntu 9.04 in 17 of the 29 benchmarks. The graphics performance in Ubuntu 9.10, which will be out after the release of Mac OS X 10.6, may improve with Intel working to fix its regressions. Beyond improving the graphics performance and potentially some minor performance improvements thanks to an updated Linux kernel and the newer GCC 4.4 series, we would not anticipate the Ubuntu 9.10 performance to be drastically different.

==== Hands on: Canonical aims for the cloud with new Ubuntu One ====

ARS Technica's Ryan Paul tells us that Canonical, the company behind the popular Ubuntu Linux distribution, is preparing to launch a new Web service called Ubuntu One, which will bring cloud synchronization and collaboration features to the Linux desktop. The service is under heavy development, but it is expected to be ready for widespread use when Ubuntu 9.10, codenamed Karmic Koala, is released in October. Ubuntu One will support tight desktop integration and to achieve that goal, the developers are building client software that will make the service a seamless part of the desktop experience. The software is currently available to beta testers in an Ubuntu Personal Package Archive hosted on Launchpad. The source code will be released soon under open licenses and is said to be usable on other Linux distributions.

==== Health Check: Ubuntu and Debian's special relationship ====

Richard Hillesley of H-Online notes that Ubuntu is five years old. The release of Jaunty Jackalope coincided with the fifth anniversary of a meeting that Mark Shuttleworth called of a dozen or so Debian Developers in his London flat in April 2004 to map out his project to create a distribution that was capable of taking Linux to the masses. During the five years since that meeting Ubuntu has sprung from nothing to become the most popular Linux on the street. "I'm of the opinion that Ubuntu could not exist without Debian", Shuttleworth has written. "So it's absolutely my intention to see that Ubuntu is a constructive part of the broader Debian landscape. It's vital that Ubuntu help to sustain and grow Debian, because it's the breadth and strength of Debian which make up the "shoulders of greatness" on which we in the Ubuntu community stand when we reach for the stars."

=== In The Blogosphere ===

==== Ubuntu Fans Move Quickly to Ubuntu 9.04 ====

When it comes to deploying Ubuntu 9.04 (Jaunty Jackalope), Canonical’s installed base seems to be a loyal, eager crowd. A poll conducted by WorksWithU, the vast majority of site visitors have already upgraded to Ubuntu 9.04.

According to the poll, conducted over the past three weeks:

* 71 percent of WorksWithU readers are already running Ubuntu 9.04
* 11 percent planned to upgrade sometime in April
* 11 percent planned to upgrade within three months
* 5 percent had no plans to use Ubuntu 9.04
* 2 percent planned to upgrade before the end of 2009

==== Dell offers Ubuntu Mini 10 plus SSD option ====

Dell now offers a Mini 10, loaded with Ubuntu for $399 in the U.S. and Canada.  Addition options exist, such as upgrading to either a 32GB or 64GB SSD. There is also the possibility of a 6-cell battery or a bigger 3-cell battery, Tristan Eaton-inspired designs and HD display.

==== Moving Ubuntu Mirror Server ====

Dulmandakh reports on a major boost for the Mongolian Ubuntu community.  Their mirror repository has just upgraded to a more powerful server from Dell.  This mirror was started in 2006 to make it easier and faster to make package installation and updates - up to 10 times faster.  Now, with the more powerful server, they expect to be able to serve more Ubuntu users and support the FOSS community.

http://dulmandakhs.blogspot.com/2009/05/moving-ubuntu-mirror-server.html

==== Canonical Launching Ubuntu One Storage Service ====

Canonical has begun beta testing a managed storage service — known as Ubuntu One — that allows Ubuntu 9.04 users to share and sync files between multiple Ubuntu PCs. The service, known as Ubuntu One, is in beta and available in two formats:

* Free for up to 2GB of storage
* $10 for a 10GB monthly storage plan

Ubuntu One represents Canonical’s latest attempt to build profitable recurring revenue services around the company’s popular Linux distribution.

http://www.workswithu.com/2009/05/11/canonical-launching-ubuntu-one-storage-service/

==== In Defense of the Six-Month Release Cycle ====

The poor experience of many users upgrading to Jaunty has prompted calls for a less ambitious Ubuntu release cycle. Instead of pushing out an updated version of Ubuntu with a new feature set every six months, some have argued, developers should issue new releases less frequently, or recommend that only LTS versions be used for production. Ubuntu stands out as an impressive exception in a software ecosystem where road maps often have little meaning. Since Warty Warthog made its appearance in April 2004, Ubuntu has issued a new release every six months exactly on schedule, with the singular exception of version 6.06, which was deliberately postponed six weeks. In most cases, each new release has actually been stable and ready for production use. Ubuntu’s ability to meet deadlines provides an aura of reliability and professionalism that attracts users on both desktops and servers.

=== Meeting Summaries ===

==== Server Team Meeting: May 12th ====

Here are the minutes of the meeting. They can also be found online with the irc logs here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MeetingLogs/Server/20090512.

* Merges: mathiaz reminded that karmic had opened and merging was one of the favorite activities of the Ubuntu developers these days. He also mentioned the list of easy merges [1] published in the Roadmap. These packages should not be too difficult and thus are perfect to get used to the whole merge process.

[1]: http://ubuntuserver.wordpress.com/2009/05/11/hungry-for-merges-the-ubuntu-server-team-has-a-selection-for-your-appetite/

* MIT krb5 1.7: coffedude asked about the state of krb5 in Karmic. mathiaz explained that krb5 1.7 had been synced from Debian. libkrb53 will be removed from Karmic once the transition to libkrb5-3 has been completed.

* Karmic Alpha1: mathiaz reminded that Karmic Alpha1 is scheduled for Thursday. Help in iso testing is welcome once the iso candidates are available.

* UDS: dendrobates announced that the Server team will have 2 session rooms and a break out room for UDS. The sessions will also be randomized amongst the physical rooms so that we will not just get to sit in the same room. However it may be a little complicated figuring out where to go. ttx said that a riddle would have to be solved to get to the right room while kirkland hoped for a broken RNG.

More important though was dendrobates announcement that he would buy a beer for any server team community team members that shows up. dendrobates looks like this [2] and becoming a member of the server team is a simple two steps
process [3].

[3]: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ServerTeam/GettingInvolved#becomemember

* Web Mirror Manager: gourgi asked whether the web mirror manager [4] blueprint would be discussed. nijaba pointed to the relevant blueprint [5] in Launchpad which will be discussed in the Fondations track.

[4]: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WebMirrorManager
[5]: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/foundations-karmic-repository-management

* screen-profiles renamed to byobu: kirkland announced that the screen-profiles project had been renamed to byobu, a japanese term for elegant folding room dividers, aka folding screens.

* Agree on next meeting date and time: Due to travels and UDS it was decided to cancel the meeting for the next two weeks.

Next meeting will be on Tuesday, June 2nd at 15:00 UTC in #ubuntu-meeting.

=== Community Spotlight ===

==== Hall of Fame, Ante Karamatic ====

Ante is one of the oldest contributor to the Ubuntu Server team having joined on a Friday, the 11th of November 2005. He is a regular attendee of the Ubuntu Server Team meeting and has always specific issues to discuss. His insight has also been valuable during most of the sessions at past Ubuntu Developer Summits. While he considers that Ubuntu Server is a rock-solid product he still has a list of small improvements that should be made.

His bug triaging and packaging skills are put in full action while helping out a wide variety of packages such as the redhat-cluster suite, drbd and bacula. During the last release cycle he also worked on an improved out-of-the box experience for dovecot and postfix. As you can see Ante has a definite interest in everything related to high availability and mission critical components in corporate environments.

Whenever he finds time to come down from his snowboard and reach his computer you'll find him hanging out in the ubuntu-server IRC channel helping out with support requests, discussing webserver benchmarking or planning for the next feature he's working on to move Ubuntu Server another step ahead.
