Uganda and Tanzania

In Runyakitara which is the collection of dialects spoken by the Banyankore, Banyoro, Batooro and Bakiga of Western Uganda and also the Bahaya, Banyambo and others of Northern Tanzania, "obuntu" refers to the human characteristics of generosity, consideration and humane-ness towards others in the community. In Luganda, the language of the Baganda in Central Uganda "obuntu" means being humane and refers to the same characteristics.

=== Welcome! ===
This is the wiki page of the Uganda Local Community Team. We aim to provide free community support to users of the various flavours of Ubuntu as well as advocating the use of Ubuntu to individuals and organisations alike. We keep in touch via our active <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-ug|email list]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[UgandaTeam-IRC| IRC chatroom]]</nowiki>. This group is for anyone in the Uganda (but we welcome non-Uganda residents) who uses or is interested in some flavour of Ubuntu, whether it's Ubuntu, Kubuntu or any others. This group is for people of all technical abilities from I've-never-heard-of-linux all the way to I'm-an-Ubuntu-Master.

=== How do I join? ===
There is no official process to join, however if you join the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/people/ubuntu-ug|launchpad team]]</nowiki> you are then able to vote in polls organised by the group. Discussion happens on the <nowiki>[[http://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-ug|mailing list]]</nowiki> which you are free to join. There is also an active group of members who chat in real time on <nowiki>[[UgandaTeam-IRC|IRC]]</nowiki> in the #ubuntu-ug channel on irc.freenode.net.

It would be nice if you could update the <nowiki>[[UgandaTeam-UgandaLugMembers| LUG Members Page]]</nowiki> if you are indeed a member of a LUG or <nowiki>[[UgandaTeam-OtherGroups| Other Groups Members Page]]</nowiki> if you are a member of any other Linux or Free Software related groups.
