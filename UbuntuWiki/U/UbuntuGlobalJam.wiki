The '''Ubuntu Global Jam''' is an incredible opportunity for the Ubuntu community to unite together around the weekend of ''' Friday, 7 August 2015 17:00 to Sunday, 9 August 2015 22:00 UTC''' to work together to improve Ubuntu. Everyone is able to contribute to the Jam, and everyone is welcome and encouraged to get involved. Curious about how to make a real difference to Ubuntu? This is a great chance to make that difference.

'''To check out the list of participating teams in the world, or to add your event, have a look at the <nowiki>[[http://loco.ubuntu.com/events/global/3139/|LoCo Directory event]]</nowiki>.'''

The '''Ubuntu Global Jam''' incorporates events that have been organized over the world to get Ubuntu contributors and fans together to have a great time and improve Ubuntu. 

== Running the event ==

Running the event is as simple as finding a venue, picking a date and time, and promoting it. Check out more details on planning your own <nowiki>[[Jams|Ubuntu Global Jam]]</nowiki>.

=== FAQ ===

==== What is the Global Jam? ====
 A world-wide online and face-to-face event to get people together to work on Ubuntu projects - we want to get as many people online working on things, having a great time doing so, and putting their brick in the wall for free software as possible. This is not only a great opportunity to really help Ubuntu, but to also get together with other Ubuntu fans to make a difference together, either via your LoCo team, your LUG, other free software group, or just getting people together in your house/apartment to work on Ubuntu projects and have a great time.

==== What goes on during the event? ====
 Collect bugs, fix them, testing, documenting and translating. Get together and make Ubuntu better.

==== Do you meet in a specific place, or just talk on irc? ====
 Both would be great, but it's great to meet in person with other people. You should stop by #ubuntu-locoteams to join in on the action. Also don't forget to microblog with the hashtag #ugj to spread the word!

==== What do we need? ====
 You need a place to be, with decent internet connection, some computers, and great people to share the work. Probably you can find a place in a University, school or even neighbourhood local. Contact your local translation team.
