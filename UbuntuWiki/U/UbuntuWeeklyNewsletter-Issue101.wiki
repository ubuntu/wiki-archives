==== Intrepid Alpha 3 released ====

Alpha 3 is the third in a series of milestone CD images that will be released throughout the Intrepid development cycle. The Alpha images are known to be reasonably free of show stopper CD build or installer bugs, while representing a very recent snapshot of Intrepid. Pre-releases of Intrepid are *not* encouraged for anyone needing a stable system or anyone who is not comfortable running into occasional, even frequent breakage.  They are, however, recommended for Ubuntu developers and those who want to help in testing, reporting, and fixing bugs. You can download it here:

==== MOTU school session: Maintainer Scripts ====

The MOTU school is in session, and this time it's Maintainer Scripts.  Cesare Tirabassi is offering a beginners session in maintainer scripts on the 28th July at 14:00 UTC, in #ubuntu-classroom on irc.ubuntu.com. This will be a great session for anyone starting out with packaging, or anyone looking for a refresher on this topic. Maintainer scripts are important parts of a package, so this should be a useful session. If you can't attend, logs of the session will be available, afterwards. https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-motu/2008-July/004252.html

==== Ubuntu Screencasts ====

Mixing A Podcast In Ardour -  - The UK Lo``Co Team has released the first 6 installments of a 13 part series outlining how to mix a podcast in Ardour. It is their hope that it will benefit others with editing podcasts, or even just editing in general.  The original was recorded at 2560 X 1024 resolution so those with smaller screens may want to select a lower resolution available at the links.

* Part 1: A brief introduction to the applications used and some tips on setting up the environment. http://screencasts.ubuntu.com/Mixing_A_Podcast_In_Ardour_-_Part_1

* Part 2: Some tips regarding jack and real time kernels, sessions in Ardour, adding tracks and adding audio files to tracks. http://screencasts.ubuntu.com/Mixing_A_Podcast_In_Ardour_-_Part_2

* Part 3: Podcast running order, aligning multiple tracks, and fading music down and up with the "draw gain automation" tool. http://screencasts.ubuntu.com/Mixing_A_Podcast_In_Ardour_-_Part_3

* Part 4: Adding a longer track, and aligning it with other tracks, using the "draw gain automation" tool to eliminate unwanted background noise and inserting a sting between segments. http://screencasts.ubuntu.com/Mixing_A_Podcast_In_Ardour_-_Part_4

* Part 5: Adding a music 'bed' in the background and splitting tracks. http://screencasts.ubuntu.com/Mixing_A_Podcast_In_Ardour_-_Part_5

* Part 6: Details how to add the outro, and a review. http://screencasts.ubuntu.com/Mixing_A_Podcast_In_Ardour_-_Part_6

==== LoCo Team Approvals ====

Lithuania - The Ubuntu Lithuania Lo``Co team was founded in July 2005 they are most active in Installfests, presentations, collaboration with other Lo``Co teams, printed press and radio, CD distribution, and translations. Their roadmap shows that they want to be more active in development, education, GreenPC, and Ubucon Baltic. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LithuanianTeam/ApprovalApplication

Tunisia - The Ubuntu Tunisia Lo``Co team has been most active in Installfests, SFD Tunisia, various local conferences, and CD distribution. Their road map indicates that they want to take part in SIB 2008(Tunisia computer exposition), build a working relationship with local universities, and creating a local ubuntu mirror. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TunisianTeam/ApprovalApplication

Japan - The Ubuntu Japanese Lo``Co team has successfully completed the review process for a previously approved team. They are most active in managing bugs submitted in Japanese, promoting Ubuntu with Japanese businesses, a Japanese version of the Official Ubuntu Book, written articles for print and online local magazines, local conferences, and deploying new archive mirrors. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/JapaneseTeam/ApprovalApplication

The Lo``Co council is happy to welcome these teams to the growing list of officially approved Lo``Co teams. Great job!

=== In The Press ===

* Mark Shuttleworth: Ubuntu in emerging markets - Mark Shuttleworth sees the greatest potential for growth in emerging markets and in mobile, where he believes that software freedom has the most to offer. His mission is to bring Linux to new audiences, not to displace the other major distributions. He notes that the sub notebook market offers a unique opportunity for Linux vendors, where there is real room for linux to be a commercial success. Shuttleworth's presentation offered a compelling glimpse at the man behind one of the most successful Linux distributions. His dynamic style of expression and obvious enthusiasm for Linux captivated the audience. http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080722-mark-shuttleworth-life-on-mars-ubuntu-in-emerging-markets.html

* OSCON, Pt. 2.1: A Few Words With Mark Shuttleworth - For many people, Ubuntu is Linux, and Mark Shuttleworth is Ubuntu. It might come as a surprise to learn that the prime mover behind one of the most successful and visible Linux distributions isn't entirely comfortable with that. Ubuntu celebrates everyone else's work, and we focus our energy to deliver their thinking to the world wide community. This interview also gives us insight into Mark's thinking on how to draw people to Ubuntu as contributors, and how to get continued participation from developers. You can also see a video of Mark talking about who his personal heroes are and why, by visiting the link. http://www.informationweek.com/blog/main/archives/2008/07/oscon_pt_21_a_f.html

* Legion of Talk Event Podcast | Mark Shuttleworth on Ubuntu and Space Travel - Hazelnut Tech Talk presents the full 84 minute audio recording of the presentation that Mark Shuttleworth made at Mc``Menamins Mission Theater, in Portland, Oregon.  This is the talk that was sponsored by Strands and Legion of Tech. http://oakhazelnut.com/2008/07/22/legion-of-talk-event-podcast-mark-shuttleworth-on-ubuntu-and-space-travel/

* Shuttleworth: Make Desktop Linux Better than Apple - Darryl K. Taft reports on a talk that Mark Shuttleworth made at OSCON. During the talk, Mark said he thought the greatest task in front of us over the next two years is to lift the experience of the Linux desktop from something that is stable, robust and not so pretty, into something that is art. There is need to invest in making the desktop beautiful and useful, because now more than any other time in history, software matters. The iPhone is a great example of effective use of the pure software experience, and it's no accident that over the last 10 years in technology, many of the biggest brands have been built using free software. http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Linux-and-Open-Source/Shuttleworth-Make-Desktop-Linux-Better-than-Apple/

=== In The Blogosphere ===

* NASA Uses Ubuntu - Mackenzie had the opportunity to visit a Smithsonian Folklife Festival with some friends when NASA had an exhibit going.  After looking around, they noticed a demonstration of a robot climbing a wall. They looked at the laptop the man was using to control the webcam attached to the robot, and saw the Hardy Heron wallpaper showing in a corner of the screen. A closer inspection showed that compiz was also running.  http://ubuntulinuxtipstricks.blogspot.com/2008/07/nasa-uses-ubuntu.html

* Ubuntu VS Other Linux Distributions - There are many things that make Ubuntu different from other Linux distributions. The ease of installation, the APT(Advanced Package Tool) for software management, and the unique use of sudo instead of su. Ubuntu has unique features that have their advantages and disadvantages, but they are far from limiting. Ubuntu has the tools in place to allow you to customize, modify, experiment, and hack to your heart’s content if that is what you want to do. Otherwise, the idea is to be an easily maintainable, secure system with a clear and concise application set which is neither limiting nor overwhelming. This makes Ubuntu a very fluid system allowing you to jump right in and become familiar with it very quickly.  http://computingtech.blogspot.com/2008/07/ubuntu-vs-other-linux-distributions.html

* A Week of Ubuntu - After hearing good things about Ubuntu, oilee decided to give it a try. He first tried installing on an older machine, but had no luck. He then decided to use his main computer and is now dual booting Ubuntu. Initially he was worried about driver issues with his video card and a few other components, but he was pleasantly surprised to see everything worked. He was also a little worried that the UI would be a little clunky, but he actually found it to be very polished. In terms of programs, he didn’t feel deprived at all. He'll still have to get acquainted with Synaptic, but as it stands now, he's really impressed with Ubuntu. http://oilee.wordpress.com/2008/07/21/a-week-of-ubuntu/

* Ubuntu Linux, My Favorite Desktop - amumtaz has used Linux in the past, but he decided to to try Ubuntu to see what all the hoopla was about. He booted the live CD on his laptop and was surprised when it picked up all the needed drivers, including those needed for Wi``Fi. Installing was next, and in less than a hour he was up and running. All the programs were there, and his USB was flash drive mounted first try. He's decided to keep Ubuntu as his default desktop, and will be using it to do all his daily chores. http://amumtaz.wordpress.com/2008/07/21/ubuntu-linux-my-favorite-desktop/

* A few suggestions to improve Ubuntu - Nicolas Bouliane has had some problems working with Ubuntu, and offers these suggestions for improving it.  One, in particular, is the ability to bulk-rename files when file names conflict with existing files.  Another is to add a restore button to the trash applet. A third is to improve the options on "autorun" for storage cards. Nonetheless Ubuntu is still excellent and worth a try.
