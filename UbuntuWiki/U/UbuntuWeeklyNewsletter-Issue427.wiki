==== How UbuConLA 2015 evolved in the past months ====

José Antonio Rey writes that he is impressed and excited with how the upcoming UbuConLA (Latin America) is shaping up. Name badges and banners have arrived but the online Registration form however has been closed, as pre-registrations exceeded the size of the auditorium. José writes that the registration basis is first-come, first-serve so to keep an eye out for more information on social media, and concludes by saying: “Hope to see you in August, can’t wait for UbuConLA to happen!”

==== Zygmunt Krynicki: Using Snappy Ubuntu Core to test-boot anything ====

Zygmunt Krynicki shares that Inception OS is a small Ubuntu Snappy Core based system with programmable boot-process control, and allows any x86/amd64 to be converted into a remotely controlled web API. He says that anyone can reflash the OS and reboot a fresh image (once). Details of installing and using Inception OS are provided, and it will boot non-Linux code.

==== Benjamin Kerensa: Ubuntu Trends: Part 1 ====

Benjamin Kerensa provides graphs of “Ubuntu Lo``Co’s Trend” (by region over years), and “Ubuntu Membership Trends” (by year). He notes that statistics should not be considered to reflect to Ubuntu overall losing popularity, as data from Google Trends shows an overall downtrend for other desktop OS’s likely correlating to end-users spending more time on mobiles. Benjamin also warns that whilst 2015 is included; its data is obviously incomplete.

==== Converting old guidelines to vanilla ====

Richard Mc``Cartney writes about the conversion of styling away Guidelines, the framework developed by the Canonical design team with an array of tools to create consistent Ubuntu themed websites. He writes that Guidelines had many shortcomings (no build system for one), and introduces the Vanilla project. The main goal of Vanilla is to make generic extendable and easy changes possible.

=== In The Press ===

==== I used this crazy alternative 'Ubuntu' phone for a month and ended up liking it more than Android ====

Alastair Stevenson of Business Insider reviews the Meizu MX4 Ubuntu Edition phone finding it to be the most unique and alien mobile operating system that he’d ever experienced. He describes the operation of the phone saying that he found himself looking for dedicated apps rather than scopes but the he eventually adjusted to the Ubuntu way of doing things. Alastair says that his biggest criticism of the phone is that it is not yet smart enough, many key services are missing but that he would definitely urge "tech savvy buyers or developers interested in trying something new" to buy an Ubuntu phone.

=== In The Blogosphere ===

==== GCC 5 Is One Week Away From Landing In Ubuntu 15.10 ====

==== HP ProBook 455 Ubuntu review ====

James Archer, writing for V3, reviews the HP Pro``Book 455 Ubuntu which is one of a series of low-budget laptops produced by HP who joined forces with Canonical and eBuyer. With the aid of some photographs, James looks at the display, the design, the performance and the battery of the machines. Despite some good features he says in his conclusion: "We believe that Ubuntu, with its frequent updates and top-notch security, has the potential to break into the business laptop space in spite of Windows' dominance. But it needs the right machine, and this, sadly, just isn't it."
