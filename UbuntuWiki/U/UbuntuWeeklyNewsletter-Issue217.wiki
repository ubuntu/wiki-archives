=== General Community News ===

==== UWN Catchup, Help the Graner Family ====

We've been a bit silent over the last three weeks. This has been in part due to the very busy Ubuntu Developer Summit, but also because our great editor, Amber Graner had the misfortune of her house being burnt down during UDS leaving nothing left. Fortunately, her family (including the dog) are safe and unharmed.

This issue will be a bulk issue covering news items from the last three weeks. If we missed something, please let us know and we'll be delighted to include it in the next issue.

A fundraiser has been established to help the Graner family. If you are interested, please read further on the Ubuntu-News site:

http://ubuntu-news.org/2010/10/29/help-the-graner-family/

==== Ubuntu 11.04 to Ship Unity ====

Mark Shuttleworth just announced at the Ubuntu Developer Summit in Orlando that we will be shipping the Unity environment in the Ubuntu desktop edition. Unity is the environment we shipped on the Ubuntu Netbook Edition for the first time in Ubuntu 10.10 Maverick Meerkat, and users and OEMs have been enjoying the experience. It is an environment that is inspired by great design, touch, and a strong and integrated experience.

I think this is a fantastic opportunity for Free Software, and this is going to be a busy cycle. We have a lot of work to do, and we know that quality is a firm focus for this release, and we have identified a solid set of issues we need to focus on and resolve, but I know the final product will be something that we will all be proud of. Another key focus is performance; we have already started porting Unity from Mutter to Compiz and the initial work is much faster, most notably on hardware that has traditionally had the most trouble from bug reports. Quality meets design meets performance. Together as a community we can make this rock.

There is going to be some questions about this decision in relation to GNOME. I want to make something crystal clear: Ubuntu is a GNOME distribution, we ship the GNOME stack, we will continue to ship GNOME applications, and we optimize Ubuntu for GNOME. The only difference is that Unity is a different shell for GNOME, but we continue to support the latest GNOME Shell development work in the Ubuntu archives.

==== Unity on Wayland ====

Mark Shuttleworth announced on his blog that the next major step for Unity is to deliver it on the Wayland display server. While this will be a big transition for Ubuntu, Mark states that it doesn't need to cause a reset in the way we run software. Software that will not be ported to work with the new display server will still be able to run under an X server compatibility mode.

==== Emmet Hickory replaces Richard Johnson on Community Council ====

Due to a range of other commitments, Richard Johnson has stepped down from the Ubuntu Community Council.

The current members of the CC want to thank Richard Johnson for all the work he put into Ubuntu Governance. He will be missed. Everybody wishes him all the best on his next endeavors.

Emmet Hikory is replacing Richard Johnson, based on the outcome of the last Community Council vote.

Welcome aboard Emmet!

==== Ubuntu Cloud Community Needs You ====

"I'm interested in Ubuntu and the cloud, how do I get involved" is a question I got a few times already. I thought it would be a good idea to answer this as a blog post. I believe one of the very first things you'd want to do, is to make sure you're on the main communication channels, talking to the community, asking questions, seeing other questions being answered, trying to answer some yourself, sharing opinions and generally "connecting" with the rest of the community. That is a great first step. So I'll highlight the main communication venues for the Ubuntu cloud community, as well as a way to get kick-started.

Places to be:

* Ubuntu Cloud Forums, while pretty young, there has been a pretty good stir in the forums. While IRC and mailing lists may be more focused on "asking questions", the Forums are a great way to get in touch with other community members. To share your experience building your private clouds, the hardware used, software configuration, tuning and optimization, challenges faced, ... Come and join in, if you would like to ask questions, or if you would like to share opinions, tips or tricks, get on the forums and make a splash :)
* The Ubuntu-Cloud mailing list is a great technical resource where most of the experts and developers are subscribed. For very technical discussions, questions, feature suggestions, RFEs and development discussions then the mailing list is a great resource.
* The EC2Ubuntu mailing list is a great resource that focuses on running Ubuntu in the Amazon EC2 public cloud. This list is active with a wealth of information on the topic.
* IRC chat has long always been a primary real-time communication tool used by free software enthusiasts. The Ubuntu cloud IRC room is (surprise, surprise) `#ubuntu-cloud` on Freenode. Jump in, and engage

Once connected, the things that you can do include playing with the latest technology, such as creating yourself a private UEC (Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud) instance, verifying that the latest features work as advertised, reporting and fixing bugs, suggesting features, designing and implementing new projects to advance the state of Ubuntu on the cloud. Whilst the community is very welcoming, I definitely understand that we need to create better new-comer friendly engagement paths—more hand-holding if you will. A better mentoring programme from senior members as well as low-hanging fruit are things that the Ubuntu cloud and server communities need to identify and improve in order to make it easier to attract and engage fresh talent.

==== Yes, we did it: SpreadUbuntu.com is up now! ====

Ruben Romero updates us to let us know that the new Spreadubuntu.com website is up and ready for use. Spreadubuntu is a community website where user contributed marketing materials are made available for remixing and general consumption.

==== Matt Zimmerman: Ubuntu and Qt ====

Matt has been thinking about Qt recently and how it may apply to Ubuntu's desire to allow making applications easier and more efficient. Matt notes that Qt has a good history on ARM as well as x86, that Qt is cross-platform among all major operating systems and that it already has a fairly mature touch input system.

==== Raphaël Hertzog: Managing distribution-specific patches with a common source package ====

Raphaël walks us through a new feature in the Debian 3.0 (quilt) source package format that allows a packager to apply a patch to a specific distribution. This feature can be incredibly handy to a package maintainer who would, for example, like a patch to be applied in the Ubuntu version but not in the Debian versuib, allowing the change to be made just once and reducing future packaging efforts.
