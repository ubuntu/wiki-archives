Brainstorming page for Ubuntu Studio's Lucid Lynx release.

So what do we wanna tackle?

* JACK in main.
* New art (James (dashua) and I will tackle this)
* LOTS of bug fixin'. *-controls and *-settings bugs are drivin' me nuts. Looks like *-controls needs love as well.
* Point site to wiki?
* LV2 in Lucid - what needs to be done?
