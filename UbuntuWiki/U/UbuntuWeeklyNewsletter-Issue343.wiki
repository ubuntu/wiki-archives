==== Trusty attends first Ubuntu Hour ====

Elizabeth Krumbach Joseph writes that for each Ubuntu release, she spends a little time finding a toy or other representation of the codename animal to use at booths, Ubuntu Hours, and other events. Elizabeth says that a Trusty Tahr took some tracking down, so she settled for a Hansa 15″ mountain goat and shows us some photographs of its first Ubuntu Hour in San Francisco!

http://princessleia.com/journal/?p=8719

==== Three Teams Verified ====

Stephen Michael Kellat informs us that the Lo``Co Council recently recently verified the following communities: Ubuntu Morocco, Ubuntu Brazil, and Ubuntu Portugal. Stephen encourages leaders of Ubuntu communities to read through the successful teams' check-in applications as much can be learned from lateral team-to-team contact, and he reminds us that the Ubuntu Ohio Verification check-in is coming up soon on the Council's agenda.

==== Alan Bell: Building Ubuntu for the Raspberry Pi ====

Alan Bell writes about a project that he has been wanting to do for some time, to build Ubuntu from source on a Raspberry Pi. He introduces the project with an embedded video. Alan asks anyone wanting to contribute to join other contributors on the Indiegogo website. He ends his post by saying "The funding campaign runs through to Christmas but as we have some of the money available already I am thinking we will probably start getting some bits fairly soon and start setting up the cluster controllers and do some power measurements and more detailed performance testing."

http://www.theopensourcerer.com/2013/11/building-ubuntu-for-the-raspberry-pi

==== Benjamin Kerensa: Awesome vUDS Sessions ====

Benjamin Kerensa writes that he will be unable to attend vUDS as it is difficult to justify taking time off his other projects for a virtual event. Benjamin points out that the Ubuntu Documentation Roundtable, SDK for HTML5 App Developers, Ceph activities for Trusty, and Limiting Surveillance in Ubuntu sessions should be checked out, and he gives his reasons for doing so.

http://benjaminkerensa.com/2013/11/14/awesome-vuds-sessions

==== Xubuntu: Xubuntu 14.04 Default Wallpapers ====

The Xubuntu team announces that for 14.04, integration of a set of good-looking wallpapers is planned as according to reviews the feature has been lacking for a while. The team has put together a webpage with guidelines for the wallpapers and advise that all decisions will be taken by the Xubuntu artwork team. Wallpaper submission is by upload to the Xubuntu Wiki.

http://xubuntu.org/news/xubuntu-14-04-default-wallpapers/

=== In The Press ===

==== Dell aims for cloudy orbit with Sputnik Ubuntu developer project ====

Gavin Clarke of The Register writes that Dell is ramping up efforts to position the Sputnik Ubuntu developer project as a cloud development platform. It has enlisted a startup called Docker to help improve the ability to build, test, and deploy cloud apps, and is also working on a Profile Tool for building virtual apps. All the developers have switched full-time to the XPS 13 developer edition as their primary laptops.

==== Hillsboro School District considering open-source solutions in wake of failed bond measure ====

Luke Hammill of The Oregonian writes that the Hillsboro School District is considering switching to Ubuntu following a failed bond in the recent election. They are looking to replace Windows 7 on their older hardware which has gotten slower as a result of the upgrade from XP. The free software and lower system requirements make Ubuntu especially appealing to them.
