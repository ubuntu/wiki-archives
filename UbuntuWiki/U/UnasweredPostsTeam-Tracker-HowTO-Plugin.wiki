This is how to use, and install the Tracker Plugin.

Step 1) Install the tracker from the main page at <nowiki>[[http://ua.codechunk.net]]</nowiki>

Step 2) Go to customise in your firefox toolbars: <nowiki>[[http://img114.imageshack.us/my.php?image=customisekq3.png]]</nowiki>

Step 3) Drag the 'Tag thread' plugin to anywhere on your toolbars: <nowiki>[[http://img508.imageshack.us/my.php?image=plugindragei4.png]]</nowiki>

Then, when you answer a post, you just click the red flag that is where you dragged the tag thread plugin.

If you wish to tag a thread for help, just go to the stats tab, and click on the 'open' status: <nowiki>[[http://img153.imageshack.us/my.php?image=statsur6.png]]</nowiki> (just make sure there is at least one other post in the thread other than the Original Poster, you could just do a generic response like: "hi, im just tagging this thread for help with the unanswered posts team, hopefully you will get help soon.") Then just change the status from 'open' to 'help': <nowiki>[[http://img153.imageshack.us/my.php?image=helpeb0.png]]</nowiki>
