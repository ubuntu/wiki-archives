Hi,

A new version of the UEFI SecureBoot shim has been prepared for upload
to <ubuntu release>, and needs to be submitted to Microsoft for signing.

Attached are the files /usr/lib/shim/shimx64.efi and
/usr/lib/shimaa64.efi from the shim
<version> package.

The package where these binaries originate are:

amd64: <url to the build, ie. https://launchpad.net/~canonical-foundations/+archive/ubuntu/shim/+build/15261659>
arm64: <url to the build, ie. https://launchpad.net/~canonical-foundations/+archive/ubuntu/shim/+build/15261660>

The files to be signed are contained within the packages as
/usr/lib/shim/shim*.efi, with the following sha256sum:

amd64: <sha256sum of the binary>
arm64: <sha256sum of the binary>
< any other architectures for which shim binaries need to be signed >

Please submit them to Microsoft for UEFI signing.

Thanks,

<attach the relevant .efi files>
