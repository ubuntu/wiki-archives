{{{#!IRC
[16:00] <kim0> Howdy
[16:01] <kim0> Hello everyone, welcome to the very first Ubuntu Cloud Days
[16:01] <ttx> yay!
=== ChanServ changed the topic of #ubuntu-classroom to: Welcome to the Ubuntu Classroom - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Classroom || Support in #ubuntu || Upcoming Schedule: http://is.gd/8rtIi || Questions in #ubuntu-classroom-chat || Event: Ubuntu Cloud Days - Current Session: Cloud Computing 101, Ask your questions - Instructors: kim0
[16:01]  * ttx attends two conferences at once.
[16:01] <ClassBot> Logs for this session will be available at http://irclogs.ubuntu.com/2011/03/23/%23ubuntu-classroom.html following the conclusion of the session.
[16:02] <kim0> So again, good morning, good afternoon and good evening wherever you are
[16:02] <kim0> Please be sure you're joined to this channel plus
[16:02] <kim0> #ubuntu-classroom-chat : For Questions
[16:03] <kim0> In case you would like to ask a question
[16:03] <kim0> please start it with "QUESTION: <question goes here>
[16:04] <kim0> and write it down in the #ubuntu-classroom-chat channels
[16:04] <kim0> This session is mostly about taking questions and making sure everyone is well seated :)
[16:04] <kim0> Seems like I have a question already
[16:05] <ClassBot> EvilPhoenix asked: I think this could be the start of it.  Could you give a brief explanation of what "Cloud Computing" is defined as?
[16:05] <kim0> Hi EvilPhoenix .. Good question indeed
[16:06] <kim0> Trying to answer your question .. I will begin by saying
[16:06] <kim0> Cloud has so many different definitions already :)
[16:06] <kim0> Almost all companies by bent it to mean whatever product they're selling
[16:06] <kim0> the term has really been abused
[16:07] <kim0> The are also various definitions by institutions like NIST and others
[16:07] <kim0> since there is no one single true definition .. I'll lay down some properties
[16:07] <kim0> that almost everyone agrees should be present in a "cloud"
[16:08] <kim0> 1- Pay per use .. Cloud are online resources that can be characterized by "pay per use"
[16:08] <kim0> you only pay for the resources that you need .. the storage you consume
[16:08] <kim0> the CPU/Memory compute capacity that you are using ..etc
[16:09] <kim0> You never really (or should never) pay in advance .. (just in case you need that resource)
[16:09] <kim0> 2- Instant scalability: Cloud solutions should be instantly scalable
[16:09] <kim0> that is .. with one api call (that's one command, or a click of a button for non programmers)
[16:09] <kim0> you should be able to allocate more resources
[16:10] <kim0> Clouds convey the feeling of inifinite scale .. of course in reality it's not truly infinite .. but it's large enough
[16:11] <kim0> 3- API programmability .. Most cloud solutions are going to have an API .. an API is a programmatic way to control your resources
[16:11] <kim0> Taking a prime example .. The largest commercial compute and storage cloud today is Amazon's AWS cloud
[16:11] <kim0> With Amazon's cloud, with an api call (or running a command)
[16:12] <kim0> you can instantly allocate "servers"
[16:12] <kim0> so it's got an API interface
[16:12] <kim0> it's scalable .. since you can always add more servers (or S3 storage) should you want to
[16:12] <kim0> and you only pay for the consumed CPU hours .. or gigabytes of storage
[16:13] <kim0> Clouds are usually split up by their type as well
[16:13] <kim0> IaaS , PaaS and SaaS
[16:13] <kim0> let me quickly comment on those types
[16:13] <kim0> IaaS : Infrastructure as a Service
[16:14] <kim0> This basically means you get "infrastructure" components (that is servers, storage space, networking ...etc" as as service ..
[16:14] <kim0> You use those to build your own cloud or application
[16:14] <kim0> PaaS : Moves a little up the value stack
[16:14] <kim0> It provides a complete development environment as a service
[16:15] <kim0> so you basically upload some code .. and without needing to worry about servers or networks/switches or storage ..etc
[16:15] <kim0> your application just runs on the "cloud" .. is scalable, is redundant
[16:15] <kim0> someone else (the PaaS provider) did that work for you
[16:16] <kim0> Examples of PaaS would be Google's AppEngine .. salesforce.com or others
[16:16] <kim0> The last type is SaaS : Software as a Service
[16:16] <kim0> This basically means providing a full complete application, that you are directly using in the cloud
[16:16] <kim0> examples of that would be facebook, gmail, twitter ..etc
[16:17] <kim0> Those are "applications" if you come to think of it .. more so than the notion of webpages
[16:17]  * kim0 checks if he has more questions 
[16:17] <ClassBot> BluesKaj asked: ok then what Ubuntu Cloud about ?
[16:18] <kim0> Hi BluesKaj
[16:18] <kim0> Very good question as well
[16:19] <kim0> So Amazon's cloud is a very popular IaaS cloud. However, some people are not totally happy with the fact that they'd upload their data to amazon's datacenters
[16:20] <kim0> some enterprises or ISPs .. would like to utilize the improved economics of the cloud model
[16:20] <kim0> however still keeping their data and servers in-house (whatever that means to them)
[16:20] <kim0> In order to build a cloud that competes with Amazon's cloud
[16:20] <kim0> you need various software components
[16:21] <kim0> Ubuntu packages, integrates and makes available the best of breed open-source software
[16:21] <kim0> that enables you to build and operate your own cloud should you want to
[16:21] <kim0> In the upcoming 11.04 natty release
[16:21] <kim0> Ubuntu packages two open-source complete cloud stacks
[16:21] <kim0> those would be
[16:22] <kim0> - Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud : An Ubuntu integrated and polished cloud stack based on the popular Eucalyptus stack
[16:22] <kim0> - OpenStack : A new opensource cloud stack that's gaining a lot of popularity
[16:22] <kim0> Actually we have dedicated sessions for each of those cloud stacks!
[16:23] <kim0> An interesting fact .. is that UEC and OpenStack both allow you to expose an API that is the equivalent of Amazon's API
[16:23] <kim0> that means you can use the same management tools to control both the public (Amazon's ) cloud and your own private one!
[16:24] <kim0> This is also great for providers wanting to run their own clouds
[16:24] <kim0> so that was an overview of the cloud stacks available to enable
[16:24] <kim0> you to build your own cloud envrionment
[16:25] <kim0> Other than that .. and to fully answer the question of "What is ubuntu cloud" .. I need to add a few more points
[16:25] <kim0> Ubuntu makes available official Ubuntu images that run on the Amazon cloud as well
[16:25] <kim0> You can check them out (as they're regularly updated) on http://cloud.ubuntu.com/ami/
[16:26] <kim0> you basically search for what you want, like (maverick 64 us-east) pick the ami-id
[16:26] <kim0> and launch that
[16:27] <kim0> Also Canonical makes available Landscape a cloud management tool .. you can check it out at https://landscape.canonical.com/
[16:27] <kim0> Also, Ubuntu is soon unleashing cloud management and orchestration tool called "ensemble"
[16:28] <kim0> that is going to revolutionize cloud deployments and management .. it's still in early tech-preview stage
[16:28] <kim0> however we're having an ensemble session and demo today
[16:28] <kim0> I think that mostly covers a broad definitions of ubuntu and cloud
[16:28] <ClassBot> Kruptein asked: so dropbox isn't cloud related? as you don't have to pay for it (basic)
[16:29] <kim0> Hi Kruptein
[16:29] <kim0> Well .. dropbox is cloud storage indeed
[16:29] <kim0> I meant that with cloud .. when you want to grow you pay for what you used/need
[16:30] <kim0> as opposed to buying a 1TB disk that lays on your desk so that when you need the capacity it'll be available for you
=== cmagina is now known as cmagina-lunch
[16:30] <kim0> with dropbox you pay for what you use .. although I believe they only allow payment in coarse packages
[16:30] <kim0> as opposed to Amazon's S3 which charges you per GB of storage per month
[16:31] <kim0> which is a more fine grained model
[16:31] <ClassBot> BluesKaj asked: ok then what is Ubuntu Cloud about ?
[16:31] <kim0> So I believe we covered that
[16:31] <kim0> To quickly recap
[16:31] <kim0> - Building your own private cloud : UEC/Eucalyptus or OpenStack
[16:32] <kim0> - Running over the Public Amazon Cloud : Official Ubuntu Server images http://cloud.ubuntu.com/ami/
[16:32] <kim0> - Systems Management tools : https://landscape.canonical.com/
[16:32] <kim0> - Infrastructure automation : Ensemble (tech-preview)
[16:33] <kim0> Again all of those tools and technologies (except for landscape) are having their own sessions that you'll enjoy :)
[16:34] <kim0> Let me not forget as well about "Ubuntu ONE"
[16:34] <kim0> a personal storage cloud (very similar to dropbox)
[16:34] <kim0> Check it out at https://one.ubuntu.com/
[16:34] <ClassBot> popey asked: Should your average end-user care about Ubuntu cloud? If so, why? If not, what do we say to end users when they see all this promotion of Ubuntu cloud stuff?
[16:34] <kim0> Hi popey
[16:35] <kim0> Great question
[16:35] <kim0> It really depends on your point of view
[16:36] <kim0> The usual-suspects to care about "cloud" stuff are going to be sys-admins, devops, IT professionals .. people who care about server environments and such .. However!
[16:36] <kim0> If you ask me, yes non IT pros should care as well
[16:37] <kim0> because the computing model is quickly shifting to a cloud model
[16:37] <kim0> that is .. instead of you buying a pc, loading it with your personal applications and settings
[16:37] <kim0> and being a sysadmin for yourself .. handling backups .. troubleshooting, software upgrades ..etc
[16:38] <kim0> the world is shifting into an ipad/iphone/thin-client/mobile devices world
[16:38] <kim0> where your data lives on a cloud
[16:38] <kim0> is accessible by a wide varierty of tools
[16:38] <kim0> and all tools sync up together
[16:39] <kim0> obviously the point of interest is going to be different, however it remains that the cloud touches all of us
[16:39] <ClassBot> cdbs asked: The Clous world is buzzing about OpenStack. Natty will include support for OpenStack along with Eucalyptus. Once OpenStack Nova becomes stable enough (should happen soon, by May) then will Ubuntu begin recommending OpenStack for its cloud offerings?
[16:40] <kim0> Hi cdbs
[16:40] <kim0> Seems you're on top of things hehe I can't really claim to foresee the future. Ubuntu is and has always aimed at providing the best of class open-source cloud technologies and software
[16:41] <kim0> As it stands, UEC product is based on Eucalyptus bec it is a mature product
[16:41] <kim0> however since openstack is rapidly maturing, it has been packaged and made available as well
[16:42] <kim0> I am confident Ubuntu will continue to make available all mature choices of best of breed software
[16:42] <ClassBot> Yuvi_ asked: you can differentiate between public cloud and private cloud?
[16:42] <kim0> Hi Yuvi_
[16:42] <kim0> Well, yeah I guess
[16:43] <kim0> Public clouds are cloud operated by an entity you don't control
[16:43] <kim0> and that provide services to multiple other tenants
[16:43] <kim0> examples would be Amazon cloud, rackspace, go-grid, terremark ...etc
[16:43] <kim0> A private cloud, is a cloud that probably runs behind your firewall on your own servers
[16:44] <kim0> and that you can control, i.e. is operated by IT people you have direct influence upon
[16:44] <ClassBot> at141am asked: Is the demo open to all for ensemble, if so when and where?
[16:44] <kim0> Hi at141am
[16:44] <kim0> Yes absolutely!
[16:45] <kim0> The Ensemble session is today in less than a couple of hours
[16:45] <kim0> right here in this same channel
[16:46] <kim0> The session leader is probably going to be copy/past'ing text so that you can follow up the demo
[16:46] <kim0> I'm not really sure how it would go .. but I'm sure it's gonna be loads of fun
[16:46] <ClassBot> marenostrum asked: What does "Ubuntu One" have to do something with "cloud" concept?
[16:46] <kim0> Hi marenostrum
[16:47] <kim0> Ubuntu ONE is a personal cloud service
[16:47] <kim0> It is designed for end-users .. that is non IT pros
[16:47] <kim0> It provides services to sync your files and folders to the cloud
[16:47] <kim0> sharing them to other people
[16:47] <kim0> not only that .. but also
[16:47] <kim0> sync's your "notes" across multiple machines
[16:47] <kim0> your music
[16:47] <kim0> Bookmarks
[16:48] <kim0> I think soon it might sync application settings and the apps installed
[16:48] <kim0> so that when you get a new Ubuntu machines .. it installs all your applications, applies all settings, syncs your data/notes/bookmarks ..etc
[16:48] <kim0> that would be lovely indeed .. I'm not sure if it can do all that just yet thought
[16:48] <kim0> though*
[16:49] <ClassBot> sveiss asked: do the official Ubuntu EC2 images receive updates? Specifically kernel updates, which are a bit of a pain to deal with via apt-get on boot.
[16:49]  * kim0 trying to answer questions quickly :)
[16:49] <kim0> Hi sveiss
[16:49] <kim0> The answer is absolutely YES
[16:49] <kim0> they do receive regular updates
[16:49] <kim0> of course you can always apt-get upgrade them any way
[16:50] <kim0> the one potential pain point .. is the one you have mentioned "kernel upgrades"
[16:50] <kim0> for that .. I've some good news
[16:50] <kim0> Newer AMIs are designed to use pv-grub
[16:50] <kim0> which is a method exposed by Amazon to load the kernel from inside the image
[16:51] <kim0> which means .. you can now apt-get upgrade your kernel .. and very simply reboot into it
[16:51] <ClassBot> There are 10 minutes remaining in the current session.
[16:51] <kim0> if you need to know which exact version switched to pvgrub .. check in at #ubuntu-cloud
[16:51] <ClassBot> IdleOne asked: Repost for AndrewMC :What would be the benifits of using the "cloud" instead of, say  a dedicated server?
[16:52] <kim0> Hi IdleOne
[16:52] <kim0> the main benefits is really
[16:52] <kim0> - Pay per use .. I might need ten servers today .. but only one tomorrow .. cloud allows that .. dedicated servers don't (you'd have to buy 10 servers all the time)
[16:53] <kim0> - flexibility .. If we web application gets slashdotted .. and the load is too high .. within a few seconds .. I can spin up 20 extra cloud servers to handle the load
[16:53] <kim0> - Also .. since almost all clouds provide an extensive API
[16:54] <kim0> it really helps with IT automation .. spin up servers, assign them IPs, attach storage to them, mount a load balancer on top
[16:54] <kim0> all by running a script .. not by running around connection cables :)
[16:54] <ClassBot> Yuvi_ asked: What is hybrid cloud? Under which scenario we can use that
[16:54] <kim0> A hybrid cloud is a mix of public + private
[16:55] <kim0> a typical use case would be
[16:55] <kim0> you prefer running everything on a private cloud that you own and operate
[16:55] <kim0> *however* should the incoming load by too high
[16:55] <kim0> like your application was slashdotted
[16:56] <kim0> you would dynamically "expand" to using a public cloud like amazon/rackspace
[16:56] <kim0> to take some heat for you .. to lessen the load on your servers
[16:56] <ClassBot> There are 5 minutes remaining in the current session.
[16:56] <kim0> You can pull off something like that today with UEC and some smart scripts
[16:56] <ClassBot> chadadavis asked: what advantage does a private cloud provide, vs a traditional server cluster, assuming that then the sysadmin work is not outsourced?
[16:56] <kim0> running out of time ..
[16:57] <kim0> trying to quickly answer
[16:57] <kim0> well basically it's the same concept of public cloud
[16:57] <kim0> Benefits would be
[16:57] <kim0> - Complete infrastructure automation
[16:57] <kim0> - Enabling "teams" to handle their own needs .. a team would spin up/down servers according to their needs
[16:57] <kim0> lessening the load on IT staff
[16:58] <kim0> also .. "pooling" of IT servers into one private cloud
[16:58] <kim0> means providing a better service to everyone
[16:58] <kim0> since everyone can use some of the resources when they need it
[16:58] <kim0> so in short .. pooling, self service, low overhead, spin up/down
[16:59] <kim0> Great
[16:59] <kim0> Seems like I did manage to bust all questions :)
[16:59] <kim0> If anyone would like to get a hold of me afterwards
[16:59] <kim0> I am always hanging out in #ubuntu-cloud
[17:00] <kim0> you can ping me any time and I will get back to you once I can
