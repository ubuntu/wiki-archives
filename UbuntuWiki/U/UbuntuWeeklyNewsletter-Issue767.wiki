==== Proposal: Remove Archive Manager from default install ====

Jeremy Bicha reminds us "GNOME 41 dropped Archive Manager (file-roller) from GNOME Core" and the reason for it, thus Jeremy proposes that it be dropped from the default Ubuntu Desktop install. Jeremy tells us how we can test it out, and the support he noticed it misses, with a note that he'd likely install file-roller himself in the future.

==== Lubuntu 23.04 Now Uses PipeWire! Info you should know + Call for Testing ====

Aaron Rainbolt tells us Lubuntu has migrated away from Pulseaudio, moving to Pipe``Wire audio in the Lubuntu 23.04 release. This post is written for current users of the Lubuntu development product, warning they'll need (currently) to manually remove two packages to ensure the switch to Pipe``Wire fully occurs. Bluetooth support is mentioned, with a request for users to test it reporting any differences they experience on this thread. A note on instability is mentioned when using QEMU and certain hardware, with a request for user testing also.

==== Patch now: Serious Linux kernel security hole undercover ====

Steven Vaughan-Nichols reports on a new Linux kernel bug as discovered by Zero Day Initiative. We are told it's serious & requires immediate patching, impacting the 5.15 kernel. We are given details on who developed ksmbd, how the flaw in existing code can be utilized by malicious code, along with commands we can use to check if our systems are impacted.
