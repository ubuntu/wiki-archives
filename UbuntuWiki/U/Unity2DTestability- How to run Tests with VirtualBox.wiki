__TOC__

These instructions show how to run tests on Unity2D running inside a VirtualBox instance

Terminology:
* '''host''' - your standard Ubuntu installation (running on the ''bare metal''), which runs the test scripts and controls the target.
* '''target''' - the Ubuntu installation inside VirtualBox, where the software being tested resides and is controlled by the host.

Quick setup guide: 

=== Host ===
* edit /etc/tdriver/tdriver_parameters.xml and add the line 
    <parameter name="qttas_server_port" value="55536" />
  This will make the ruby scripts try to connect to the qttasserver inside the VM

* check out this branch, compile

=== Target ===
* Run Ubuntu inside a VM. 
* Install testability-qttas, xdotool, xsel, x11-utils. 
* Set up port-forwarding in VirtualBox like this:
** shutdown the VM
** in the VirtualBox settings manager, click Settings and go into the Network pane
** Click the 'Port Forwarding" button
** Add new entry like so:
<pre>
      Name: "guestqttas"
      Protocol: "TCP"
      Host IP: ""
      Host Port: "55536"
      Guest IP: ""
      Guest Port: "55535"
</pre>
** now you can start the VM again (good to turn off screensaver too :) )

* check out this branch ******into the same directory as on the host machine******
* compile it
* start "qttasserver"

=== Back to Host ===
* go into test directory
* run "ruby run-tests.rb"
