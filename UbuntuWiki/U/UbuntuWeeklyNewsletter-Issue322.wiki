==== Mark Shuttleworth: Here comes the Carrier Advisory Group ====

Mark Shuttleworth announces that the first meeting of the Ubuntu Carrier Advisory Group has taken place to help “figure out how best to shape Ubuntu to meet the needs of the mobile industry.” Of the meeting itself, Shuttleworth also writes: “We mapped out our approach to the key question I’ve been asked by every carrier we’ve met so far: how can we accommodate differentiation, without fragmenting the platform for developers? We described the range of diversity we think we can support initially, received some initial feedback from carriers participating immediately, and I’m looking forward to the distilled feedback we’ll get on the topic in the next call.”

==== Ubuntu Donations And Community Funding ====

Specific details about Ubuntu Donations and Community Funding have been announced following a plan prepared by Jono Bacon and approved by the Community Council. Donation periods will occur every 6 months, and the money received in the previous cycle will go to fund the current cycle. Those wishing to apply for funding must submit a form, and it cannot be used for an arbitrary amount of money for a person or a team. A report containing the budget, a list of items where the money was spent, and the remaining balance will be released at the end of the cycle.
