==== Ubuntu bug fix anniversary ====

Jeremy Bicha gives us an introductory history of his Ubuntu journey, illustrating that contributing works to great effect. The first encounter was Ubuntu 6.06 LTS, his first contribution was helping test release candidate images of Ubuntu 9.10 (karmic koala), where he discovered bugs which resulted in filing bug reports. Jeremy briefly mentions some of the progress in filing, uploading, sponsoring, and processes, including stable release upgrades, that got the bug fixed. We're also told of the introduction of Unity, Jeremy's working on getting GNOME available for Ubuntu users, his first Ubuntu Developer Summit, becoming a Ubuntu Core Developer, Debian Developer, and this year joining Canonical. Finally we're told as this started 13 years ago, and with Ubuntu's use of "alphabetical adjective animal release names" we're back to K or "kinetic kudu". We are encouraged to help test release candidates, consider the upcoming Ubuntu Summit, and told newcomers are still sponsored just as Jeremy was 13 years ago.

==== The easier way to install Steam on Linux gets bleeding-edge graphics support ====

Kevin Purdy tells us "Installing Steam on a Linux system just got a little easier" as Canonical has announced their Steam snap supports "bleeding edge" Mesa graphics APIs. With a reminder of what snap packages are, we are told Canonical worked with Valve to "bake in the Mesa drivers and Proton and Wine wrappers" allowing some "Windows-via-Linux games". We are told this includes "support for removable media, high-DPI displays" and more, including some clues on how it works, and changes that will occur. Many links are provided.

==== Ubuntu Touch development - Wanna sponsor ARM64 CPU power for CI build infrastructure? ====

Mike Gabriel makes a plea to the community to aid the UBports Foundation in their time of need. The effort to port Ubuntu Touch to an Ubuntu 20.04 base is in jeopardy as the current server sponsor will soon decommission the build server.
