=== In The Press ===

==== Ubuntu aims for ten second boot time ====

ARS Technica's Ryan Paul notes that the growing adoption of the Linux operating system on netbook devices has compelled Linux distributors to focus on improving startup performance. Ubuntu 9.04, which was released last month, is one distribution where these improvements are particularly noticeable. In a presentation at the Ubuntu Developer Summit in Barcelona, developer Scott James Remnant noted that boot time decreased from 65 seconds in version 8.10 to only 25 seconds in 9.04. This is already a substantial improvement, but he believes that there is still room for more aggressive optimization. Canonical will continue pushing the limits of boot performance during the upcoming development cycle for Ubuntu 9.10, which is codenamed Karmic Koala. According to Remnant, the company aims to achieve a ten-second boot time next year for Ubuntu 10.04, the release that will follow after Karmic. This emphasis on boot performance will make Ubuntu a more competitive option for hardware makers who are seeking a fast and lean distribution to preinstall on netbook devices. http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2009/06/ubuntu-aims-for-ten-second-boot-time.ars

==== Upgrading Ubuntu 8.04 to 9.04 ====

The Linux Loop tells us that around the time Ubuntu 8.10 was released, their hard drive died and they figured that, as long as they were reinstalling anyway, they should try upgrading to 8.10. Unfortunately, they experienced a couple of problems with 8.10 and so they reverted to 8.04. Recently they have been encountering situations where the packages in the repositories were too outdated so rather than continually patching these outdated packages, they decided to upgrade to 9.04. The only thing the Linux Loops reports that they had to reconfigure was their fingerprint reader, and that leads to their one complaint about the upgrade process. From beginning the first upgrade to finishing the second the process took six hours, but it would have been a lot faster if the upgrade tool hadn’t kept asking questions in the middle of the upgrade. Whenever the installer runs into a configuration file that has been modified, it pauses the upgrade and asks if you want to replace it. In the Linux Loop's opinion the option to set a default behavior should be given at the beginning or you should have the option to deal with all the issues at the end to help speed up the upgrade process. http://www.linuxloop.com/news/2009/06/07/upgrading-ubuntu-804-to-904/

==== Testing Out ATI Kernel Mode-Setting On Ubuntu ====

Michael Larabel of Phoronix tells us that the kernel mode-setting for Intel graphics hardware can already be found in the mainline Linux kernel and will be included by default in the release of Ubuntu 9.10 later this year. While Intel's kernel mode-setting support has been maturing in a steadfast manner, this support has not been moving along quite as fast for ATI and NVIDIA hardware. It is possible we will see ATI/AMD kernel mode-setting along with the necessary memory management support enter the Linux 2.6.31 kernel and potentially see this feature appear in Ubuntu 9.10 as an end-user option, but currently this support is still deemed under development. For those with ATI Radeon hardware looking to test out kernel mode-setting, there is now a Launchpad PPA and a Live``CD available for testing out these mode-setting capabilities atop Ubuntu. http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=ubuntu_ati_kms&num=1

==== GRUB2 To Be Used By Default In Ubuntu 9.10 ====

Phoronix's Michael Larabel reports that starting with Ubuntu 9.10, and beginning with daily CD builds starting June 9th, GRUB2 will be the default boot-loader on new Ubuntu installations. GRUB2 will bring internationalization support, support for newer systems, and many other improvements considering this GNU boot-loader has been in development for a number of years. This change was announced today on the Ubuntu development list after discussions took place recently at the Ubuntu Developer Summit. More on Ubuntu's GRUB2 implementation can be found via their kernel team Wiki. http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=NzMxMg

==== Explaining Ubuntu's 10 Second Boot Time ====

Phoronix's Michael Larabel tells us that two weeks ago he reported that Plymouth would not be making its way to Ubuntu with the next 9.10 release as was once planned. Instead Canonical is putting their focus on improving the boot time so that there is less rationale for spending time on making a fashionable boot experience. With Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, Canonical is looking to achieve a ten second or less boot when using the Dell Mini 9 or similar devices. With Ubuntu 9.10, they hope to be on their way to accomplishing this goal. Canonical's Scott James Remnant has now outlined more on their plans for the Ubuntu boot performance targets with Ubuntu 9.10 and 10.04 LTS. The main areas that developers will be working on is speeding up the X Server start-up process and improving initramfs. http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=NzMxMw

==== Ubuntu One Beta Finally Kicks Off ====

Martin Kaba of Kabatology reports that Ubuntu One Beta, the Dropbox type of service by Canonical, has finally kicked off, but not for everyone. When his invitation arrived he quickly moved on to test it. Kaba states, "It is very intuitive, yes, but damn slow and often breaks - - that certainly why it’s still a beta." To install, just read through the Installation Instructions. After that, get connected and start syncing. A right-click on the Ubuntu One icon menu, gives the user the options to disconnect, report a problem, open a folder, or go to web. Kaba also reminds everyone that if they are amongst the few selected people to test Ubuntu One, don’t forget to report any problems! http://www.kabatology.com/06/09/ubuntu-one-beta-finally-kicks-off/

==== Ubuntu 9.04 vs. Fedora 11 Performance ====

Michael Larabel of Phoronix notes that Fedora 11 was released earlier this week so they have set out to see how its desktop performance compares to that of Ubuntu 9.04, which was released back in April. In a number of the benchmarks the results were close, but in a few areas there are some major performance differences. In particular, with the test profiles that stress the system disk, Fedora 11 generally did much better -- in part due to the EXT4 file-system and newer Linux kernel. Fedora also did much better with the database tests like SQLite and PostgreSQL. Ubuntu 9.04 though had done a better job with the Apache Benchmark and C-Ray. http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=fedora11_ubuntu904_perf&num=1

==== Ubuntu 9.04: New Intel Graphics Drivers ====

Linux Pro's Kristian Kissling tells us that there is hope for Ubuntu users with Intel graphics. As it appears, the current 2D drivers solve most of the recent graphics problems with Intel chips, according to Ubuntu developer Bryce Harrington in a developer mailing list. A nuisance to owners of Ubuntu 9.04 and Intel graphics chips has been the problems with the graphics drivers. Even though Intel manages its drivers in an exemplary open source way, 2D and 3D acceleration has fairly much dragged so far. The reason is an unhappy pairing of the current Kernel 2.6.28's Kernel Mode Setting (KMS) with Intel's new UXA acceleration architecture that replaces EXA and the newly added Graphics Execution Manager (GEM) in the Kernel. The solution should come in the form of the Intel 2.7.99.1 driver. Harrington mentions that Jaunty users have the advantage of the Kernel 2.6.30 installation to resolve the issue. Harrington suggests activating the UXA module in the xorg.conf file, but not KMS, which is deactivated by default. http://www.linuxpromagazine.com/online/news/ubuntu_9_04_new_intel_graphics_drivers

==== Ubuntu 9.10 Alpha 2 Released ====

Phoronix's Michael Larabel reports that Ubuntu 9.10 "Karmic Koala" Alpha 2 is now available. This second testing release for the forthcoming Ubuntu 9.10 doesn't bring too much in the way of exciting features or major changes since the release of Alpha 1. There is, however, GRUB2 as the default boot-loader. There are also some updated X.Org bits, the Linux 2.6.30 kernel, the latest GNOME 2.27.x packages, and other updated packages pulled in from Debian. Unlike the first alpha release, a desktop Live``CD build of Ubuntu 9.10 Alpha 2 is also available. Updates to Kubuntu and Xubuntu are also available at this time. The Ubuntu 9.10 Alpha 2 release announcement can be read on their development announcement list. http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=NzMyMw

=== In The Blogosphere ===

==== Dell's new inexpensive Linux notebook ====

Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols, the Cyber Cynic posting on COMPUTERWORLD Blogs, notes that Dell has released a full-sized notebook with Ubuntu 8.10 pre-installed at a netbook sized price.  The Dell Insprion 15n has a 15.6" screen, an Intel GMA X4500MD graphics chipset, a 2.16GHz Intel Celeron 585 processor, 2GB of DDR2 RAM and a price-tag of $299.  See what he has to say at:  http://blogs.computerworld.com/dells_new_inexpensive_linux_notebook

==== Trouble Brews With Ubuntu Users Mailing List ====

Guy Thouret blogs on Works With U about the problem of people not following the Code of Conduct and mailing list etiquette and procedures when posting to the ubuntu-users mailing list.  He lists specific things that a poster should bear in mind, as well as touches on discussions of what to do about the problem and the outcome of those discussions.  Read the whole thing at:  http://www.workswithu.com/2009/06/10/trouble-brews-with-ubuntu-users-mailing-list/

==== Memo to Canonical: Don’t Repeat IBM’s Mistakes ====

Joe Panettieri, writing for Works With U, defines the mistake that IBM made in the early 1990's when they offered support for Windows software in OS/2.  The result was that developers weren't writing software as native to OS/2.  His concern is that by supporting Google Android and Moblin v2 Ubuntu may not be emphasizing to ISVs that they really need to write Linux native code, too.  His article can be found at:  http://www.workswithu.com/2009/06/10/memo-to-canonical-dont-repeat-ibms-mistakes/

==== Fair is Fair - Ubuntu Netbook Remix ====

Jamie Watson, in a blog on the ZDNet UK website, reports that he is trying Ubuntu Netbook Remix in an effort to give a reasonable comparison between that and Moblin.  After installing it on a nettop he observed that it was much more what he was accustomed to than Moblin.  But, then he begins to wonder if that's really good.  His article asks more questions than it answers, but raises interesting points about what a new user unfamiliar with Linux would like to see.

==== Review: Ubuntu 9.04 on my ASUS Eee PC 901 ====

Petros Koutoupis was unimpressed with the Xandros Linux customized installation that came on the ASUS Eee PC 901, and felt that Easy Peasy still didn't enable him to multi-task as he was used to.  So he installed Ubuntu 9.04 standard desktop release rather than the Ubuntu Netbook Remix.  This provided him with more of what he wanted - the ability to have several windows available at one time without any of them necessarily being full screen.  See the rest of his report at:  http://blog.hydrasystemsllc.com/2009/06/11/review-ubuntu-904-on-my-asus-eee-pc-901/
