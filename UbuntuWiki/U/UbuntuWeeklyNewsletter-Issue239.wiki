==== Colin Watson: Quality in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS ====

In this post Colin Watson says, “As is natural for an LTS cycle, lots of people are thinking and talking about work focused on quality rather than features.”  Watson outlines a laundry list of things he would like to see occur in this cycle. This list includes:

* Precise to have been more or less continuously usable from Alpha 1 onward for people with reasonable general technical ability
* Canonical engineering teams outside Ubuntu (DX, Ubuntu One, Launchpad, etc.) to be comfortable with running the development release on at least one system from Alpha 2 onward
* Installability problems in daily image builds to be dealt with within one working day, or preferably before they even make it to daily builds
* The archive to be close to consistent as we start milestone preparation, rather than the release team having to scramble to make it so
* A very significant reduction in our long-term backlog of automatically-detected problems
