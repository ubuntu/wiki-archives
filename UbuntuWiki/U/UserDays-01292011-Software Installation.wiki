[09:02] <pleia2> shrini: take it away! :)
[09:02] <shrini> Hello all
[09:02] <shrini> So happy to meet you all here
[09:03] <shrini> Here, let us explore the various options of package management in ubuntu
[09:04] <shrini> One of the best feature that ubuntu provides is its package management
[09:04] <shrini> When I was in windows world, I used to carry some 30 to 40 CDs with me always
[09:04] <shrini> they were filled with various software
[09:05] <shrini> I had my local collection of required software
[09:05] <shrini> but the ubuntu linux changed the way we approach installing software in our systems
[09:06] <shrini> Let us explore about installing and removing of various software in ubuntu linux
[09:06] <shrini> using Graphical Tools and commandline tools
[09:07] <shrini> First tool is "Ubuntu Software Center"
[09:07] <shrini> It is available under the menu "Applications"
[09:08] <shrini> Hope you all have ubuntu machines now
[09:08] <shrini> Please open that software
[09:09] <shrini> It is talking a little time to load
[09:09] <shrini> It is there opened
[09:09] <shrini> It is showing some departments
[09:09] <shrini> What are they?
[09:10] <shrini> Unlike Windows and Mac, Ubuntu linux provides tons and tons software
[09:10] <shrini> It gives a central place where we can fetch required software
[09:12] <shrini> That central place is available in the internet
[09:12] <shrini> it is called as "repository"
[09:13] <shrini> Ubuntu gives some default repositories to fetch the software
[09:13] <shrini> we can add some extra repositories too.
[09:13] <shrini> repository can be called as "repo" too
[09:14] <shrini> The default repository is available at http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu/dists/
[09:14] <shrini> you can browse the available packages for all the ubuntu versions
[09:14] <shrini> Let us come back to our "Ubuntu Software Center"
[09:15] <shrini> The available software in the repositories are categorised into various departments
[09:16] <shrini> Ubuntu is for all human beings
[09:16] <shrini> so it provides software for various fields where computers can be used
[09:17] <shrini> From Education, development, graphics, multimedia, research, office to games
[09:17] <shrini> and more
[09:17] <shrini> Let us explore the Graphics packages available
[09:18] <shrini> I am clicking the "Graphics" department
[09:18] <shrini> It gives some more categories like 3D, Drawing, Photography, Viewers etc
[09:19] <shrini> Going into Photography
[09:19] <shrini> It provides all the software required for digital photography management
[09:19] <shrini> See the small green tick mark in the "Shotwell Photo Manager"
[09:20] <shrini> It means that "Shotwell Photo Manager" is already installed in our computer
[09:20] <shrini> We can install any of the software shown here
[09:21] <shrini> Let us install "Gwenview"
[09:21] <shrini> It is a nice Image viewer

[09:24] <shrini> Now let us click the button "install" shown in the same page
[09:24] <shrini> Now it asks the password
[09:25] <shrini> we need the administrator privileges to install any software in ubuntu
[09:25] <shrini> The first user in ubuntu has the admin right and we can give the password
[09:26] <shrini> if we have the admin permission, the screen goes to the next stage
[09:26] <shrini> The blue bar shows the status as "installing"
[09:27] <shrini> In the left panel, we can see a new item as "In progress (1)"
[09:29] <shrini> After a while, it is finished the progress and it shows as "installed"
[09:31] <shrini> the speed depends on the speed of Internet connection
[09:32] <shrini> and the dependencies it has to download
[09:32] <shrini> We can install any package like this
[09:35] <shrini> Ubuntu provides such easiest process to install any software
[09:36] <shrini> The same software center provides some "Featured" software in the home  page
[09:38] <shrini> They are the best software referred by the ubuntu community to install and live happily
[09:39] <shrini> they are popular, stable and feature rich software
[09:40] <shrini> We can click on any already installed software and we can see the button "remove"
[09:41] <shrini> we can uninstall the software by clicking the "remove" button
[09:41] <shrini> It will ask for the password and will remove it
[09:42] <shrini> Let us explore some advanced software called "Synaptic Package Manager"
[09:43] <shrini> It is available at the menu System->administration
[09:44] <shrini> Close the Software center and open the Synaptic
[09:44] <shrini> It interface is little advanced but give a lot of details
[09:44] <shrini> The left panel gives various departments same as software center
[09:45] <shrini> the right panel lists the software available at the selected department
[09:45] <shrini> top right corner has a search box
[09:45] <shrini> give some text there and see the result
[09:46] <shrini> I give there as "thunderbird"

[09:47] <shrini> we can click on any software and select "Mark for Installation" in the menu

[09:48] <shrini> another window pops up with some more details

[09:49] <ClassBot> Fred55411 asked: Does KDE app have lots of dependencies when installed on Gnome system?
[09:50] <shrini> yes. KDE apps will download the core packages to run the KDE apps
[09:50] <shrini> we can run all the KDE apps in Gnome, after installing the required kde packages
[09:51] <ClassBot> geekosopher asked: If installing a package requires removal of other already installed program, does Software Center warn the user that the other package will be removed?
[09:51] <ClassBot> There are 10 minutes remaining in the current session.
[09:53] <shrini> it will do that automatically
[09:53] <shrini> synaptic and commandline tools will show the list of software installed and removed
[09:53] <shrini> after we confirm only they start installing
[09:54] <shrini> To remove any software using synaptic, we can click and select "Mrk for removal"
[09:54] <shrini> "Mark for complete removal" will remove all the dependency software too
[09:56] <shrini> we can edit or add repositories in "Settings->Repositories" in synaptic
[09:56] <ClassBot> There are 5 minutes remaining in the current session.
[09:56] <shrini> Let us explore some commandline tools
[09:56] <shrini> open a terminal
[09:56] <shrini> apt-cache search <name>
[09:56] <shrini> to search the software related to the "name?
[09:57] <shrini> apt-cache search thunderbird
[09:57] <shrini> will list the repated software
[09:57] <shrini> related software

[09:58] <ClassBot> Fred55411 asked: You said "left panel gives various departments same as software center" but software center's seem more "friendly" and less extensive. Do you concur?
[09:59] <shrini> Yes. software center is more user friendly
