==== Open The Cosmic Gate: A beautiful theme gets a beautiful name ====

Didier Roche writes that Communitheme is a community effort receiving loads of feedback, and consists of Sam Hewitt's Suru icons, new sounds and cursors, and an overall style refresh. Designing the theme has many considerations. The embellishments, while staying as close to upstream GNOME as possible, gives a new look and feel beyond just a theme prompting the community endorsed name, Yaru. A brief overview of the project,  why it wasn't included in 18.04 is given, including decisions such as the use/don't-use flat-design, relates the challenges leading to the final theme.  The article ends with how it will be included if you are using Cosmic (18.10) or Bionic (18.04 LTS).

==== Taking a new direction ====

Simon Quigley writes that with Lubuntu's change of direction in adopting LXQt there is a change in focus. In relating why 32 bit systems have lost focus he justifys dropping the 32 bit architechure. While still maintaining the distribution as lightweight and less resource intensive, Simon asvises " we will no longer primarily focus on older hardware". A list of core goals is  provided to guide toward the new age of computing and comments and suggestions within the blog are welcome.

=== In the Blogosphere ===

==== A Major GNOME Icon Redesign is Getting Underway ====

Scott Bouview advises us the GNOME devs are redesigning all GNOME core apps default icons as part of a GNOME design guidelines overhaul. The change includes depreciating the use of tiny icons in favor of symbolic scalable icons in order to ease the packagers job. New designs have less detail, replacing gradients and gloss with higher contrast and striking colors. The article contains many examples, including current & proposed icons.  The GNOME human interface guidelines is also being revised.

==== KDE Plasma 5.14: Default Wallpaper Revealed ====

Joey Sneddon shows us the new "Cluster" wallpaper as created by Ken Vermette using Krita, and is now the default for KDE Plasma 5.14.  Joey apprises though, the developing product in screen resolutions has a far more pleasing effect than the small images often seen online (due to losses with JPEG compression). Joey of course provides a link to see the original wallpaper, plus shows the last five Plasma wallpapers in comparison.

==== Ubuntu 18.10's New Community Theme Is Named Yaru, Here's What It Looks Like ====

Marius Nestor tells us about the upcoming New Community theme named Yaru, referencing Didier Roche's announcement. Reminding us that Ubuntu 18.10 will include the new theme & icon set by default (for new installs) that is now known as Yaru. The new Yaru theme looks great, is sharp, elegant and colorful according to Marius, and tends to be more discreet than the traditional intense orange, but still looks similar to Unity 7 & 8 designs. Yaru will land shortly in 18.10 daily builds, so more feedback is welcome.
