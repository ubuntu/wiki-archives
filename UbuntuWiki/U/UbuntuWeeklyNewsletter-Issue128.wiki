==== Rock The Docs: The Ubuntu LoCo Docs Day ====

What exactly is Lo``Co Docs Day? In a nutshell, it is when the Ubuntu Lo``Co community comes together to refine, add to and otherwise improve our Online Lo``Co Documentation. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LoCoTeams

We already have some excellent documentation, but much of it needs a new lick of paint and a good old fashioned refresh. As such, all the Lo``Co team are invited to come together on Feb. 12th to help make this happen. So, how do you get involved? Simple:

* Save The Date! Put the 12th Feb 2009 in your calendar as the Lo``Co Docs Day.
* On the day (or before if you want to join in the usual chit-chat) join the #ubuntu-locoteams IRC channel on Freenode.
* Contribute some of your time and expertise going in and contributing content to the wide variety of documentation. If you are unsure of where to start, why not take a look at our Lo``Co FAQ and see there are any questions that you have had in the past that the document does not answer. We would all love to see the FAQ become a hugely authoritative document. There is a suggestion of other pages that need a refresh here.

Come out, share the fun, and get involved in helping to bring the Lo``Co Wiki Documentation up to date!

==== Hall of Fame interview: Christophe Sauthier ====

Christophe Sauthier (huats) is involved in various aspects of Ubuntu. He started helping out in the team doing French translations and among other things he maintained the French Lo``Co web site.  Now he is the French Lo``Co contact and the one they turn to in emergencies:  affectionately referred to as "lé president". Christophe is a MOTU, and a driving force behind the MOTU Mentoring Reception. A You``Tube video of Christophe speaking about himself is available here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTmXJ0_G2Gk

==== Fridge Calendar Has Moved ====

The old Fridge calendar has been replaced with a Google Calendar.

The new Fridge calendar is at http://fridge.ubuntu.com/calendar. Please update your RSS feeds.

Teams needing to add meeting or events to the calendar can now do so themselves. Please refer to: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Fridge/Calendar there is a section on adding your meeting or event to the new calendar.

==== Ubuntu HugDay ====

Hug``Day is a special day where the Ubuntu Community comes together with a shared goal of triaging a specific package or set of packages. Working together allows the team to share knowledge and give some much needed assistance to the Ubuntu Developers.

* When: Feb. 12nd, 2009
* Location: IRC channel #ubuntu-bugs (freenode)
* Help on bugs: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/HelpingWithBugs/
* Info page: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBugDay/20090212

Anyone can help out reguardless of their skill level. This is a community effort to help the developers and make Ubuntu even better. Now is the time to get involved in terminating those pesky bugs.

==== Launchpad performance weeks ====

The purpose of Launchpad performance weeks is to improve the loading of Launchpad pages that currently take too much time to load or time out instead of loading. By reducing the soft and hard timeout times each month, the Launchpad team will be able to focus on those pages that need to be improved.  What it means to you is that you will see improved performance on the Launchpad site each month.

The first performance week took place last week. The next Launchpad Performance Week will be the week starting April 6th, with another starting June 1st. These dates may move depending on future schedules. Check the Launchpad News blog for corrections to the dates. http://blog.launchpad.net/

==== Canonical Survey Shows Ubuntu Server as Mission-Critical Enterprise Platform ====

Darryl K. Taft of eWeek reports that Canonical and analyst firm Red``Monk have released the findings of a survey of thousands of Ubuntu users that show usage patterns for the Ubuntu server product. The survey, completed by nearly 7,000 respondents, shows that Ubuntu is being used in most common workloads, such as Web, file, database and mail server, and is considered "mission-critical" by most respondents. Steve George, director of support and services for Canonical, said the survey indicates not only that users are primarily using Ubuntu for such common workloads, but also that the security, backup and firewall areas are important workloads being run on Ubuntu. Users strongly indicated their intent to add Ubuntu servers to their data centers in the immediate and long term. "Clearly, we have businesses of all sizes using Ubuntu to run what they consider to be mission-critical applications," George said.

==== Survey Shows Ubuntu Not Just for Desktop Anymore ====

Elizabeth Montalbano of PC World tell us that Ubuntu should not be considered merely the desktop Linux distribution of choice anymore if a new survey conducted by Canonical and open-source analyst firm Red``Monk is an indicator. The majority of nearly 7,000 businesses surveyed that are using Ubuntu Linux said they use it for a range of mission-critical workloads that are typically run on servers, such as proxy/caching, routing, mail security, clustering, virtualization, data backup and databases. Stephen O'Grady, analyst with Red``Monk, said the range of applications for which companies are using Ubuntu will surprise some people. "The workload distribution is all over the map." He also said that while the survey covered more small businesses than enterprises, the size mix of companies surveyed was broad, and companies in all ranges reported using Ubuntu beyond the desktop.

==== Sibyl Systems to Distribute Ubuntu Linux Exclusively ====

Sibyl Systems, a Central New York based IT solutions provider and subcontracting firm has announced that it will exclusively distribute Ubuntu for all its future linux deployments. Ubuntu was selected in large part because of the company's technical savvy and business acumen. The partnership will provide Canonical Ltd a local point of presence on the sales side, as well as hardware and software installation, service and support.John J Rice, president and lead engineer for Sibyl Systems states: "Canonical is a wonderful partner for us. This is a highly capable company with great integrity. They are dedicated, hardworking and they know their products inside and out. We look forward to exclusively working with them and to help them grow in the Syracuse area and north east US marketplace. Linux is the future of the desktop and server."

==== The case for Ubuntu on the server ====

In this article Leigh Dyer of PC Authority weighs the pros and cons of whether Ubuntu has a future in server deployments. Dyer installed an Intrepid server to play with and is so far quite impressed. The installer is a nicely streamlined version of the Debian text-mode installer, and it lets you enable a number of specific profiles, like ‘Visualization host' or ‘PostgreSQL server', that install extra functionality on top of the base packages. It's definitely still designed for experienced admins., there are no GUI packages on the CD, so regardless of what options you select, you'll be staring at a plain text login screen once your system boots.

=== In The Blogosphere ===

==== Ubuntu Server Linux is for business ====

Blogger Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols talks to us about a survey that was conducted by Canonical and the research company Red``Monk. According to the survey, Ubuntu Server Edition is being used for all the usual infrastructure and edge services you expect from a first class server operating system: Web, database, file, print, back-up and mail serving. He was suprised that larger companies with more than 1,000 employees were using Ubuntu in roles that he usually sees Red Hat and Novell SUSE. He even points out that Ubuntu is now powering Wikipedia. The Wikimedia Foundation recently announced that it was standardizing on Ubuntu across its farm of several hundred servers. According to Vaughan-Nichols Canonical has been working towards making Ubuntu a top server for some time, and that Canonical is quite serious about getting its share of the server market. He believes that with the results of the survey it should serve as a "notice" to all the other server systems out there that Ubuntu server is "here and it's ready to compete." http://blogs.computerworld.com/ubuntu_server_linux_is_for_business

==== Ubuntu developers visiting Ubuntu Berlin and c-base, plus interview with Mark Shuttleworth ====

Taking the opportunity brought about by the Jaunty Ubuntu Developer Sprint taking place in Berlin, the Ubuntu Berlin Lo``Co invited the developers and Mark Shuttleworth to a "night out".  Taking place at c-base, a mythical crashed extra-terrestrial vehicle that serves as the home for Ubuntu Berlin as well as a meeting place for other groups, it turned out to be a night to remember. Members of Ubuntu Berlin got to meet the developers in a relaxed atmosphere of smalltalk about space, canoing the c-base project “Open``Moon” (trying to send a rocket to the moon), and more. They also had an opportunity to interview Mark Shuttleworth and get his opinions on why he started Ubuntu, and how it compares to other methods of delivering software. The video interview of Mark is at the link.  http://www.screenage.de/blog/2009/02/06/ubuntu-developers-visiting-ubuntu-berlin-and-c-base-with-interview-with-mark-shuttleworth/

==== HP releases custom Netbook version of Ubuntu Linux ====

Blogger Andrew Nusca tells us about the HP mini 1000 Mi Edition which has a custom version of Ubuntu Linux installed on it. It's based off of Ubuntu 8.04 Hardy Heron, and has most of the normal preloaded software installed, including: Open``Office.org, Firefox, Thunderbird, Pidgin and more. It doesn't come preloaded with G``IMP though. The G``UI is where most of the changes come in. "When you first boot up the custom O``S, you are greeted with a screen with a web search engine, a list of favorite web sites and shortcuts to your music and photos." Also included is a custom media player called HP Media Style which the blogger points out that it resembles Apple's Front``Row. Experienced Linux users can still get to the terminal window by hitting Alt+F2 and entering 'gnome-terminal'. He also points out that H``P is has plans to post a utility on its website to allow users to create a system restore U``SB flash disk from Windows. It can already be done in Linux, and it can be used to turn an H``P Mini 1000 running Windows XP into a Mi Edition device. http://blogs.zdnet.com/gadgetreviews/?p=1221

==== HP drops Linux netbooks in UK ====

Claudine Beaumont of the Telegraph points out that the UK will not have the privilege of using the HP version of Ubuntu on the HP Mini 1000.  Hewlett Packard has pulled it from the UK.  This was a surprise to many in technology, since the lighter-weight Linux works better on the Atom processor and smaller storage available on such machines.  Also, ". . . as many technology websites have pointed out, the biggest-selling netbook in the UK is the Acer Aspire One – which runs a version of the Linux operating system."  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/scienceandtechnology/technology/technologynews/4528830/HP-drops-Linux-netbooks-in-UK.html

==== First Ubuntu Event in Monastir Tunisia ====

Rafik reports on the personal initiative install fest held in Monastir, Tunisia on February 4 at the High Institute of Computer Sciences and Mathematics (ISIMM).  The dean of the school assisted them by making an amphitheater available for the event, and a banner was created, saying, "It's time to forget about Windows".  Rafik was assisted in this event by Badii Mriga and Sabri Ben Dhaou.  Some students were unable to attend due to courses, and some were impatient and installed Ubuntu prior to the event.  Regardless, they had fun and look forward to holding a Jaunty Jackalop Release Party and install fest.

** prepare for the Ubuntu booth

==== Tunisian Team ====

In the continuation of the ENIS event 8.12, abstract: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TunisianTeam/TeamReporting#ENIS%20Event%208.12, the members of the loco redo a second trip of 3 days to the National Engineering School of Sfax (ENIS). The program of these days is visible at this address: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TunisianTeam/EventENIS9.01. During these days the Lo``Co members assured general presentations (Ubuntu, FOSS, etc.) and targeted presentations (C programming, visualization, etc.) for public present composed mainly by students and teachers. Also workshops concerning various subjects (daily use of Ubuntu, C programming, visualization, etc.) were assured by the Lo``Co members.

Half a day was reserved for an Ubuntu 8.10 install party  where approximately hundred persons were present. Another half day was reserved for the continuation of the migration project of the ENIS Computing Center. The last two classrooms (30 PC) have been migrated to Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. This makes a total of 12 classrooms of 180 PCs that have migrated from windows to Ubuntu. A group of our Lo``Co has assured the installation and configuration of an authentication server (OpenLDAP) to centralize the management of students accounts and assure that their data and documents will be accessible from all computing center classrooms.
