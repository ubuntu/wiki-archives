==== Ubuntu 10.10 is Released ====

Some time ago a group of hyper-intelligent pan dimensional beings decided to finally answer the great question of Life, The Universe and Everything. To this end, a small band of these Debians built an incredibly powerful distribution, Ubuntu. After this great computer programme had run (a very quick 3 million minutes…or 6 years) the answer was announced. The Ultimate answer to Life, the Universe and Everything is…42, and in its’ purest form 101010. Which suggests that what you really need to know is ‘What was the Question?’. The great distribution kindly pointed out that what the problem really was that no-one knew the question. Accordingly, the distribution designed a set of successors, marked by a circle of friends…to ultimately bring Unity to all things living…Ubuntu 10.10, to find the question to the ultimate answer.

And with that, the Ubuntu team is pleased to announce Ubuntu 10.10. Codenamed “Maverick Meerkat”, 10.10 continues Ubuntu’s proud tradition of integrating the latest and greatest open source technologies into a high-quality, easy-to-use Linux distribution.

Read more about the features of Ubuntu 10.10 in the following press
releases:

Desktop and Netbook editions

http://www.ubuntu.com/news/ubuntu-10.10-desktop-edition

Server edition

http://www.ubuntu.com/news/ubuntu-10.10-server-edition

Canonical has also launched the ‘Ubuntu Server on Cloud 10’ program. Anyone will be able to try out Ubuntu 10.10 Server Edition on Amazon EC2 for free for one hour. Visitors to the download pages will now be able to choose to experience the ease and speed of public cloud computing and Ubuntu. For a direct link to the trial, please go to
http://10.cloud.ubuntu.com

Ubuntu 10.10 will be supported for 18 months on desktops, netbooks, and
servers.

Thanks to the efforts of the global translation community, Ubuntu is available in 37 languages. For a list of supported languages and detailed translation statistics for these and other languages, see:
http://people.ubuntu.com/~dpm/ubuntu-10.10-translation-stats.html

==== 10.10 10:10:10 – thank you and Happy Maverick Day! ====

Mark Shuttleworth, founder of the Ubuntu Project, writes - I spent a lot of time observing our community, this release. For some reason I was curious to see how our teams work together, what the dynamic is, how they work and play together, how they celebrate and sadly, also how they mourn. So I spent a fair amount more time this cycle reading lists from various Ubuntu teams, reading minutes from governance meetings for our various councils, watching IRC channels without participating, just to get a finger on the pulse.

Everywhere I looked I saw goodness: organised, motivated, cheerful and constructive conversations. Building a free OS involves an extraordinary diversity of skills, and what’s harder is that it requires merging the contributions from so many diverse disciplines and art forms. And yet, looking around the community, we seem to have found patterns for coordination and collaboration that buffer the natural gaps between all the different kinds of activities that go on.

He continues with - So I have a very big THANK YOU for everyone. This is our most valuable achievement: making Ubuntu a great place to get stuff done that has a positive impact on literally millions of people. Getting that right isn’t technical, but it’s hard and complex work. And that’s what makes the technical goodness flow.

==== Something New and Beautiful: Ubuntu, distilled, in type ====

Marcus and Ivanka sat Mark down for a few words of wisdom a few months ago and suggested the development of a brand new font for Ubuntu designed from the ground up. Mark writes about the progress made during the last few months, how you can get involved in the testing process and also how you can get font support for your language.

To read the post in full and find out more information go to:

==== Ubuntu Fridge: We're moving! ====

This is exciting but also may take a few days to “unpack” all the boxes and work out the kinks. Please be patient with us and if find something that needs to be fixed please let the team know by:

* IRC Channel #ubuntu-news on irc.freenode.net
* Team Mailing list, ubuntu-news-team@gmail.com
* Forums: http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=122
* Editor Email: editor.ubuntu.news@gmail.com

As most of you who follow the Fridge know, Ubuntu has been given a face-lift. There is a cool new theme with new colors, a lighter feel, and just all around an upbeat tone to all the official Ubuntu related sites. Check out ubuntu.com and canonical.com to see the new look if you haven’t done so already.

The goal was to have the redirect go live on Sunday 10.10.10 in conjunction with the release of Ubuntu 10.10. However, confirmation of this has not happened. However starting on Sunday, October 10th, we will be publishing Ubuntu News on The Fridge via ubuntu-news.org.

For more information go to:

http://fridge.ubuntu.com/node/2141

==== Forum Code of Conduct Updated ====

The Ubuntu Forums’ Code of Conduct has received minor adjustments many times over the years, usually without notice. Most changes have either been trivial or additions to encode long standing forum culture.

Yesterday, after many weeks of discussion and rewriting, a new version of the Forum Code of Conduct was posted. There are no real changes to the substance, but how we express the content is significantly improved.

Major changes include lengthening the Introduction to include all the major points and distilling the rest to two sections, one for General Policy and one for Posting Tips.

We think the community will find the updated version clearer and more efficiently expressed.

For more informaiton go to:

=== Launchpad News ===

==== Launchpad Blog: More Build Farm Improvements ====

In a slightly technical post suppliemented with a pretty graph, Julian Edwards has posted a very positive bit of developer news on the Launchpad Blog. Up until very recently the builders (machines that compile code for Ubuntu) could get blocked waiting for other packages to complete. Some optimisation has been done to improve the process and reduce blocking situations. Click through to see the pretty graphs and more detailed explaination.

http://blog.launchpad.net/cool-new-stuff/more-build-farm-improvements

==== Launchpad Blog: Continuous deployment in Launchpad ====

Robert Collins (Launchpad Technical Architect) has blogged about some changes which will affect beta testers of launchpad, the site used to manage much of the development of the Ubuntu project. In a change to the release process, beta testers should notice more rapid deployment of changes to the site, and fixes should be installable with less downtime.

http://blog.launchpad.net/general/continuous-deployment-in-launchpad

==== Launchpad Blog: Enabling Automatic Bug Expiry ====

In a contentious (to some) move, the launchpad developers will be switching on 'automatic expiry' of 'incomplete' bug reports. This feature has been available to the launchpad developers, but has been switched off. It will be enabled during the week of the 18th October 2010. For developers who would like to use this feature on their launchpad projects, they will need to switch it on at a per-project level as outlined in this blog post from Deryck Hodge.

==== Duncan McGreggor: Multi-touch at UDS-N in Orlando, October 25th-29th ====

If you're interested in tracking multi-touch sessions, you can watch our session planning evolve at the link below:
https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu?searchtext=hci-n

We've still got one more blueprint coming: A Gesture Language. I haven't had a chance to compile my notes about this yet, but when I do, there will likely be another blog post just discussing the exploration we want to do around the idea of such a language at UDS.

If you can't make it to UDS, remember that we broadcast live streaming audio and project IRC channels for each room up on a screen so that all present can read remote comments and respond to listeners' questions.

=== In Other News ===

==== Ubuntu in the Cloud ====

Try Ubuntu 10.10 Server in Amazon EC2, entirely on our dime!

You read that right, Canonical will pay for you to experience the ease of Ubuntu Server on Amazon EC2 for an hour (well, approximately 55 minutes). We will take care of the registration, and setup and even give you some pre-configured applications to choose from (such as Wordpress and Moin``Moin). We are that keen for you to see it for yourself.

What do you need to do?

As part of the login process you will be asked to set up login and security credentials. But don’t worry, it’s really quick and easy.

==== Interview with Leann Ogasawara ====

This Full Circle Magazine interview is with Leann Ogasawara,  Leann says,  "I’ve been working for Canonical for the past 3 years. Since joining the Ubuntu Kernel Team, I’ve been involved with QA and triaging, stable maintenance, and am now this cycle’s Ubuntu 10.10 kernel release manager."

==== Canonical to expand cooperation with PC vendors ====

Canonical is preparing to host a hardware summit in Taiwan in an attempt to discuss greater cooperation with Taiwan based manufacturers such as Quanta Computer, Compal Electronics, Wistron, Inventec, Foxconn Electronics (Hon Hai Precision Industry) and First International Computer (FIC). The event is meant to create a greater understanding of the advantages of Ubuntu. For the full article, follow the link below:

==== TurnKey community development contest: let the judging begin! ====

The Ubuntu community is invited to join the discussion and vote who should win $2400 in donated cash prizes. As a result of the contest nearly 30 new ready-to-use Ubuntu-based appliances will be added to the upcoming release of the Turn``Key Virtual Appliance Library, covering an excellent range of high-quality open source software.

"Looking at the big picture, what they've accomplished is not only a tribute to their own impressive abilities but also to the power of the open source ecosystem they leveraged. I can't think of any other area of human enterprise where a loosely knit band of individuals is empowered (in their spare time no less) to help enable thousands of individuals and organizations all over the world to take advantage of so much technological innovation."

=== Featured Podcasts ===

==== Lococast: A New Tech Podcast with Ubuntu Linux Flavour ====

Ever since LugRadio decided to call it quits I’ve been hoping that some other high quality Linux and tech oriented podcast would appear to fill the void left in my podcast player. The Ubuntu UK podcast is quite good, but it lacks the rough edges of LugRadio. Many podcasts out there simply aren’t professional enough, so they are tedious to listen to, or they simply aren’t geeky enough. To be successful, a podcast need to be opinionated, well-informed and up-to-date. Lococast, announced in last week’s Ubuntu News Letter, seems to have what it takes. They describe themselves as a tech podcast with Ubuntu flair.

** No quorum

** No agenda items

** No last-minute issues brought up for discussion

===== Technical Board =====

* Meeting 2010-09-07

** Agenda: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TechnicalBoardAgenda?action=recall&rev=309

** The Board will organize a regular review of user feedback on brainstorm.ubuntu.com according to the proposal described at  https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/technical-board/2010-September/000493.html

** The Application Review Board proposed by Jono Bacon in https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/technical-board/2010-September/000483.html was waved through informally, to bootstrap the application review process. We will re-evaluate in six months.

* Meeting 2010-09-21

** Chair: Martin

** Attendees: Colin Watson, Kees Cook, Scott James Remnant

** Guests: Jamie Strandboge

** Review of Actions

** Martin to follow up with Kees on-list (re: Chromium security updates) -- '''DONE'''

** Matt to implement brainstorm reviews as proposed  -- '''DONE'''

*** Martin added this as a permanent topic to the agenda, together with the next due date

** Matt to respond to jono re: application review board  -- '''DONE'''

** SRU microrelease exception for bzr (https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/technical-board/2010-September/000506.html)

** Requirement: Run selftests during package build to catch architecture specific regressions, and catch problems early

** Run tests on installed package as part of SRU verification

*** '''ACTION:''' Martin Pitt to ask Martin Pool about self test instructions on installed system

*** '''ACTION:''' Kees to add bzr self test to qa-regression-testing project

** Under those conditions, the request was unanimously approved

*** '''ACTION:''' Martin add to Stable``Release``Policy

** Chromium security updates

** Discussion has shown that a general SRU exception is the only viable way

** It is not realistic to do any serious testing on these, since updates are released so fast; updates need to happen pretty much "blindly"

** This makes it rather inappropriate for main/default install, but as an opt-in in universe the current experience with the recent Chromium SRUs showed that the process is working

** In case of new build dependencies: in general they should be bundled, but for some of them it is okay to update the system package (e. g. gyp, and perhaps libvpx); this is a case-by-case decision

** No new community bugs to look at

** Next chair: Mark Shuttleworth
