'''Mission: the primary mission for a desktop OS is to be user-friendly, and for newbie users console is NOT user-friendly, also for write very simple command.'''

'''It will be fantastic to see a distribution one day (Edgy or Edgy+1?) that will can do all these stuff via GUI'''

== Nautilus ==
* Recursive permission editing
** Nautilus has this behaviour in the 2.15.x series - <nowiki>[[http://gnomedesktop.org/node/2706|article]]</nowiki>
* Opening a file with superuser permissions
** (Imported from <nowiki>[[ListOfNGUIs]]</nowiki>) When you need to edit a file you don't have access to, you need to be able to run gksudo or similar in a transparent way without having to use the terminal and sudo things.
* Create a link to a read-only location
* Removing a symbolic link that points to a file/directory on another file system (like fat32)
* Labelling/naming a mounted removable drive (mtools)
* Hard links
** (Imported from <nowiki>[[ListOfNGUIs]]</nowiki>)In natilus, there is still no ability to change permissions recurseively. (Right-clicking on a folder and selecting properties only results in changing the permissions for THAT folder, not the potentially thousands of files within) 
Current fix: In a terminal, type '''chmod -R ### /folder/subfolder'''.

== Synaptic ==
* Opening sources.list in a text editor (-> gedit)

== PPPOE ==
* Running '''pppoeconf''' to set up a PPPOE connection the first time
* '''pon dsl-provider''' and '''poff''' to switch on and off the PPPOE connection subsequently

== gedit ==
* Opening a file in superuser mode: '''gksudo gedit''' '''''filename'''''

== Samba ==
* Need to configure fileharing by modifying smb.conf.  Cause of a lot of frutration to newbies. Needs a Samba configuration console
** <nowiki>[[http://gnomefiles.com/app.php?soft_id=1386|GSAMBAD]]</nowiki>
** <nowiki>[[http://yimports.com/~cpinto/projects/gnome/gshare|Gshare]]</nowiki>, uses FTP and zeroconf. Very simple to uses. Has ubuntu packages. 

== Alternatives ==
* Running '''sudo update-alternatives''' '''''-switch'''''. Unless ''gAlternatives'' is included in the base package

== Xorg.conf ==
(Imported from <nowiki>[[ListOfNGUIs]]</nowiki>)
* It seems to me that the first thing I do when I install any distro is change the default resolutions to delete the massive one with a low frequency, and change the "nv" line to "nvidia". It would be great if this could be done in one or more GUIs under System->Administration, as 99% of users have to edit this file at some point and the only way to do it involves using the CLI and/or editing an important system file by hand. 
Current fix: In a terminal, "sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf"

It would be extremely convenient to be able to make common edits to xorg.conf that won't break future automatic updating of the file; such as mouse buttons, monitor resolutions, etc. While some of these items can be configured via dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg, at present, you cannot properly configure anything other than a standard mouse without a manual edit. Retaining edits to xorg.conf will make future updates and upgrades to the xserver easier for beginners (no scary warning messages or decisions on whether to keep or replace xorg.conf).

== labelling removable media ==
(Imported from <nowiki>[[ListOfNGUIs]]</nowiki>)
* This currently involves not only using the command line, but installing two packages (mtools and one other). This is insanity. Furthermore, after renaming, the media has to be ejected and reinserted to pick up the label change and create a nice mount point in /media. This should all be possible from a right-click=> rename on the media entry in the tree.

== PPTP ==
* running something like: '''''pppd noauth nobsdcomp nodeflate require-mppe-128 name  domain\\\\user‐ name remotename PPTP pty "pptp 10.0.0.5 --nolaunchpppd"''''' to create a connection to a Microsoft Windows VPN Server

== Services ==
* managing services in any form (start, stop, restart, lower/raise priority, disable/enable autostart at all...). You can only disable/enable autostart for a few.
