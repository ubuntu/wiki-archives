==== Objectives ====

Here is a short list of goals as a regional Ubuntu team we will strive to achieve:
  1. Educate the public about Ubuntu
  2. Supply Ubuntu (CDs & CD images) to the general public
  3. Support Ubuntu Locally, conduct community classes and symposiums
  4. Conduct outreach programs via local schools, colleges community centers and libraries.
  5. Spread Ubuntu Linux through out the Northeastern United States.
  6. Provide assistance with migrating, installing, configuring and using Ubuntu
  7. Promote the Ubuntu Certification
  8. Work with other groups to improve peoples computing experience by increasing awareness of GNU + Linux, open source, copyleft software.
  9. start a " NU Ubuntu Team " portal as a resource guide and link to the greater Ubuntu community.
  10. Start a "NU Ubuntu Foundation" within the USA to collect donations of old Computers, and install Edubuntu/Ubuntu/Kubuntu/Xubuntu for Teachers and Students within the Nu Ubuntu Team region. We will specialize in recycling old MS & apple computers for Teachers, students, elderly and those in need.
We expect that more goals are to come as time passes.

==== Target Audience ====

Ubuntu/Kubuntu/Edubuntu/Xubuntu users(and any related derivatives) of the Northeastern United States of America.

==== Target Area ====

The Northeastern United States is a region of the United States defined by the U.S. Census Bureau. The Northeast is bordered to the north by Canada, to the west by the Midwest, to the south by the South, and to the east by the Atlantic Ocean.

As defined by the Census Bureau, the Northeast region of the United States covers nine states: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Vermont. Some unofficial classifications of the region add Maryland, Delaware, District of Columbia, Virginia, and West Virginia. We will include 11 (excluding Virginia & West Virginia) of the 13 states listed above and the District of Columbia in our target area.

It is important that our target area is aligned with the US Census Bureau definition of the Northeastern United States & include Maryland, Delaware, & the District of Columbia so we can easily do demographic research of Ubuntu/Kubuntu/Edubuntu/Xubuntu users and give us a more viable cohesive voice and community spirit.

The networking of this region is important to help in overall marketing and support in this region of the USA. while the land area is overall small compared to the rest of the USA our overall impact in our region and networking of our great cities and states will help Ubuntu tremendously.
