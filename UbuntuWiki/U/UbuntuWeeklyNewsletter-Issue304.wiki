==== Steam Client now available in Ubuntu Software Center ====

The Steam client is now available in the Ubuntu Software Center, after Valve released Steam for Linux officially on Thursday, February 14th. To celebrate, all Linux titles in the Steam store are on sale with up to 75% off until February 21st. Users running Team Fortress 2 in Linux will also receive an in-game Tux penguin item, when they play, through the end of the month.

==== Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS released ====

Ubuntu 12.04.2 has been released, bringing with it many improvements, including an updated kernel and x stack, as well as the ability to install on UEFI systems with Secure Boot enabled. It also includes the updates since the last release, so that fewer updates will need to be downloaded after installation. In addition to Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS, Kubuntu 12.04.2 LTS, Edubuntu 12.04.2 LTS, Xubuntu 12.04.2 LTS, Mythbuntu 12.04.2 LTS, and Ubuntu Studio 12.04.2 LTS are now available as well.

==== 13.04 (Raring Ringtail) Alpha 2 Released ====

The second alpha of 13.04 Raring Ringtail has been released, which includes Kubuntu and Ubuntu Cloud images. The main Ubuntu version will not have alpha releases, however, opting instead for daily quality and nightly testing. The first milestone for Ubuntu will be the Final Beta Release, scheduled for the end of March. These pre-release versions should not be used by anyone needing a stable system, but should be free of “showstopper CD build or installer bugs.”

==== Xubuntu: Xubuntu goes 1GB for Raring, GIMP and Gnumeric are back ====

The ISO size for Xubuntu has increased to 1GB. Although it is too large to fit on a standard 700MB CD, the team voted unanimously to raise the size, a decision that will take effect starting with the Raring release that will be available in April. Gnumeric, a spreadsheet program, and GIMP, the popular image editor, will be included in the distro again, after having been dropped for the 12.10 release due to size constraints.
