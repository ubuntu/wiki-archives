==== Ubuntu 13 challenges Windows 8 ====

Maria Korolov of Network World talks us through an installation of Ubuntu 13.04 and compares its various features to those of Windows. She concludes that the bottom line is that Libre``Office must meet a user’s needs and that all the other applications are either available for Linux or accessible through a browser. 

http://www.networkworld.com/reviews/2013/070113-ubuntu13-271251.html

==== Ubuntu's Mir plans cause divisions ====

Fab of The H writes that after Canonical announced plans to use Mir with an X compatibility layer in the upcoming release of Ubuntu, division occurred when developers of other official derivatives decided not to follow suit. Lubuntu does not plan to ship XMir in either the 13.10 or 14.04 releases, while Kubuntu (and KDE itself) plans to support Wayland instead. It’s not clear what the projects will decide to do when Canonical stops supporting the X.org server as a fallback option in the future.

It is “expected to cost $300-450 and will come preinstalled with Ubuntu Linux and a suite of office/productivity software.”

=== Featured Audio and Video ===

==== Ubuntu Ohio - Burning Circle: Burning Circle Episode 120 ====

This week's episode talks about a set of mass expulsions from Ubuntu Ohio community membership.  The expulsions took place due to members having not signed the Ubuntu Code of Conduct which was a pre-existing requirement to being part of the community that was not well enforced.  After the discussion of what happened was a discussion of the nature of empowerment and enfranchisement in the Ubuntu community.  It was noted that “the silent majority” is not listened to and that activity is needed to be heard.  With signing the Code being a first step to many forms of participation, those who were expelled were encouraged to sign and return to Ubuntu Ohio promptly.
