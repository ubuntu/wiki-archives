The main goals of Ubucon 2016 are:

** To become a place where the members of the european Ubuntu communities can meet, learn form each other, exchange ideas and hopefully create friendships

** To create a showcase for everything (flavors, projects, commercial products etc.) based on Ubuntu

** To inform the general public about Ubuntu and all its flavors and subprojects

** To be as open for everybody and anybody

** To be as much fun as possible

What Ubucon Europe 2016 is not:

** A “generic” event like LinuxTag, OpenRheinRuhr etc.
