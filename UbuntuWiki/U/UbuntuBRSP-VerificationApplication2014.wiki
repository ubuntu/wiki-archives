=== Roadmap ===

==== Events ====
** '''FLISOL''' - The Ubuntu-BR-SP assists in organizing the event in several cities in the state of São Paulo, in addition to part with lectures on Ubuntu and Install Fests.
** '''Ubuntu Day''' - Each year the team organizes Ubuntu Day, which hosts talks on Ubuntu and free software, and install fests and accreditation of new members.

==== Meetings ====
** '''Team Meetings''' - Continue to have regular IRC meetings and get back into the habit of having one very month
