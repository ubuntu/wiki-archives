== Ideas and proposals ==
Thoughts and ideas about making sessions in other languages than English under UOW:

* Schedule a Day within UOW for sessions in other languages/timezones (Ubuntu Global Open Day).
* Assist to "normal" sessions in English on subjects you have some knowledge about and try to give the same session in your own language.
* Advertise the UOW as a multilingual event, not only for English speaking persons.

== UOW in different languages ==
