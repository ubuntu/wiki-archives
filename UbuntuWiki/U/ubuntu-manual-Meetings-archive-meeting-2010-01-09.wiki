==== Project Brief 9th January 2010 ====

Full log can be found at <nowiki>[[ http:--irclogs.ubuntu.com-2010-01-09-%23ubuntu-manual.html ]]</nowiki>.  In this meeting we discussed the rewrite of the the Table of Contents.  The result of of which can be seen at bug <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-manual/+bug/504668|#504668]]</nowiki>.

The main reasoning behind changing everything was to keep in line with the fact that we are aimed toward absolute beginner, who really don't want to touch the terminal.  We have decided that the new ToC has a better flow as well as a better content spread.

The entire conversation is up on the bug comments.
