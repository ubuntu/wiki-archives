== Debtags ==

''debtags'' are potentially useful when searching or browsing for packages outside the default Ubuntu Studio installation. Each package can have multiple tags. Read more about ''debtags'' here https://wiki.debian.org/Debtags.

Currently, not all Debian packages have a rich set of correct debtags. It is planned to assist Debian with correcting this for applications applicable to Ubuntu Studio worksflows. The following table lists the Debtags that fit with the Ubuntu Studio workflow categories. A short description is also provided to help with the process of choosing the right tags so that we do it in a consistent way. The more applicable tags that are added to each Debian package, the easier it will be for an Ubuntu Studio user to find the desired package when they search for it.
