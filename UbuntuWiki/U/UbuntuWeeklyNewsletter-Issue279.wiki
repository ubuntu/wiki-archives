=== LoCo News ===

==== Ubuntu-mx request for help ====

Javier shares that the Mexican Lo``Co was inspired by the Columbian team and is currently undergoing a reorganization process. The team has updated their website at ubuntumexico.org and is asking their members to update or reactivate their launchpad membership, and has created a list of other tasks they wish to accomplish. Javier wraps up by explaining the point of the post is to “announce that we’re alive and ready to rumble, and ask whoever wants to help to join us” and ask for suggestions on some of the technical and administrative tasks related to running the Lo``Co.

http://viajemotu.wordpress.com/2012/08/14/ubuntu-mx-request-for-help/

==== Time to Jam Again! ====

Benjamin Kerensa reminds Lo``Cos that the 12.10 release is quickly approaching, meaning that once again it’s time to plan Ubuntu Global Jams. The Jam, which takes place September 7th-9th, is an opportunity for the community to work on improvements for the upcoming release. Jams are also an opportunity to introduce Lo``Co members to different aspects of the community and new ways to contribute.

http://benjaminkerensa.com/2012/08/16/time-to-jam-again

==== Ubuntu Jam AT Nijmegen, the Netherlands ====

Rachid BM shares plans for an upcoming Ubuntu Global Jam in Nijmegen, the Netherlands in a schoolroom of AT Computing, and notes that the venue provides “computers with Ubuntu installed, so that we are ready to rock!”

http://rachidbm.com/2012/08/ubuntu-jam-at-nijmegen-netherlands/

=== Launchpad News ===

==== New fastdowntime schedule ====

Robert Collins of Launchpad discusses the new, fast application of patches over the past year using FDT (Fast Down Time). He reports the application of “60 such patches, typically taking between 60 and 90 seconds each time, at 1000UTC, our scheduled daily 5 minute downtime window for DB patching.” Collins shares that with the removal of Slony from their environment, they can now do even faster schema patches (6 seconds), and they’ll be taking advantage of this by adding two 10 second downtime windows at 0200 UTC and 1800 UTC.

=== Ubuntu Cloud News ===

* Grilo plugin for TMDB is in the queue waiting to be merged into git repository

PCManFM and LibFM have reached 1.0, which is a major update. Also, the new mini icons for the Box icon theme are in progress.

http://lubuntublog.blogspot.com/2012/08/a-few-things.html

==== Marco Ceppi: How’s Ask Ubuntu working out for you? ====

In his blog, Marco Ceppi asks about the niceness of answers on the Stack Overflow site, which hosts Ask Ubuntu. Pointing out the perennial problem of quality versus quantity, he acknowledges that the larger a community grows, the greater the loss of quality. As the original dedicated team moves on, he suggests the answers might get more rude and less helpful. He then points out that a lot of work has gone into maintaining standards, redirecting bug reports to Launchpad, and removing rude comments considered “too snarky”. 

http://marcoceppi.com/2012/08/hows-ask-ubuntu-working-out-for-you/

==== Nicholas Skaggs: Quality Perceptions Survey Results ====

Nicholas Skaggs provides results and insight from his Quality Perceptions Survey. Questions asked in the survey included questions about quality itself “What does quality mean to you?” and “What's the biggest problem with quality in Ubuntu right now?”, along with questions about using development releases and participation in the QA team itself.

==== Didier Roche: Quickly reboot: Q&A session wrap up! ====

Didier Roche shares the recording of the latest Quickly Q&A session, where he invited the community to “ask questions about Quickly and propose enhancement[s]” for Quickly. He also mentions that they’ll be taking a break from these sessions and invites people to “catch up on the session notes, and provide feedback/ideas” on the wiki: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Quickly/Reboot.

=== In The Blogosphere ===

==== Unity 6.2 Arrives in Quantal ====

Joey Sneddon of OMG! Ubuntu! writes of the recent arrival of Unity 6.2 in Quantal Quetzal’s repositories. This release contains some 91 bug fixes, including: the HUD not closing by Alt+F4 when Numlock or Capslock are on, purchased apps not showing in the Unity launcher, and more.

http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2012/08/unity-6-2-arrives-in-quantal

==== Canonical Showcases Desktop Linux, Inside the Browser ====

Christopher Tozzi reviews how the online tour of Ubuntu provides a “a rigorous and impressively smooth” preview of Ubuntu from within a web browser. Developed by Canonical’s Web Design Team, it aims at highlighting the desktop OS, the Unity Launcher and lens, and the default apps - such as LibreOffice etc.  

http://www.thevarguy.com/2012/08/13/canonical-showcases-desktop-linux-inside-the-browser/

==== We Interview Leann Ogasawara, Canonical Kernel Team Manager, Marathoner and Mother ====

==== Ubuntu Icon Comes Back to GNOME Classic ====

Joey Sneddon of OMG! Ubuntu! shows off the 114KiB update to the Light Themes package for Classic session in Ubuntu 12.04: the reimplementation of the Ubuntu icon for the Application Menu.

http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2012/08/ubuntu-icon-comes-back-to-gnome-classic

==== Unity 2D No Longer Installed By Default, Removed From The Ubuntu 12.10 Quantal Quetzal Repositories ====

Andrew of Web Upd8 writes about Unity 2D no longer being available for the 12.10 Quantal Quetzal release. “Furthermore, the latest Unity package, uploaded to the Ubuntu Quantal repositories a few hours ago, uses a "dummy" Unity-2D package, so Unity 2D is no longer available in the repositories and won't be installable at all in Quantal. Ubuntu users without graphical acceleration will be able to use Unity 3D thanks to llvmpipe.”

http://www.webupd8.org/2012/08/unity-2d-no-longer-installed-by-default.html

==== Why Ubuntu 12.04 is the best desktop experience the free software community has to offer. ====

Neil Munro covers some of the features of Unity which make 12.04 “best desktop experience that the FLOSS community has to offer.” Munro covers in detail the five-year support period included with LTS, the different feel from “the usual Gnome/KDE/XFCE interfaces” and calls it “a next generation interface.” He goes on to cover many of the features of the Unity desktop and concludes: “All these little things add up to create a very polished, functional unique branded desktop experience.”

http://nmunro.blogspot.co.uk/2012/08/why-ubuntu-1204-is-best-desktop.html

==== Say Hello To Unity’s Newest Feature: Previews ====

Joey Sneddon of OMG! Ubuntu! shares details, screenshots, and a video of one of Unity’s newest features: Previews. “In Ubuntu 12.04 and earlier Dash results sport a single action: open. If it’s a music file it opens in a music player; if it’s a Wikipedia Lens result it opens in your browser, etc. Previews give users more by introducing a ‘right-click’ action for items displayed in the lens. This action opens a ”Preview Pane” tailored for that content type.”

http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2012/08/say-hello-to-unitys-newest-feature-previews

==== Does Ubuntu Need A Separate 'eBook & Magazine' Store? ====

Joey Sneddon of OMG! Ubuntu! writes about the increasing number of eBooks and magazines in the Ubuntu Software Center. ‘Despite having ‘Software’ in its name, the shelves of Ubuntu’s one-stop app shop are starting to warp under the weight of so much reading material. One could say that the name “Ubuntu Software Center” is no longer an apt description of what is actually on offer,’ states Sneddon.

=== In Other News ===

==== Linux Top 3: SUSE Secures Boot, Ubuntu Boots Wayland, Slackware 14 Boots Up ====

Sean Michael Kerner from Linux Planet writes about some of the latest news coming out of the Linux community. He highlights “Ubuntu booting Wayland”, and says “Ubuntu is not booting Wayland in the software sense, they are 'booting' Wayland in the kicking out sense.”.

==== Best Educational Linux Distributions ====

==== Ubuntu 12.10 Is Faster With Intel Hardware ====

Michael Larabel of Phoronix shares benchmarks of Ubuntu 12.04 LTS vs. 12.10 2012-08-13 on a Compu``Lab Intense-PC. He concludes that the system “with Intel Core i7 "Ivy Bridge" processor is performing very well with Ubuntu 12.10 and a very nice upgrade already over Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. Most of the performance boosts come from continued optimizations on the open-source Intel graphics driver stack and the move to the GCC 4.7 compiler. Additional performance boosts for Nouveau/Radeon/Intel graphics may come still this cycle when moving to Mesa 8.1/9.0.”
