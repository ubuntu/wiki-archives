| Once you have the Template created and have added the issue number and dates make sure you take the sections you know you will not be using takes the clutter of the wiki out of your way (ie: we don't add Team Reports every week, they are monthly)
|-

| Add Images to the wiki
| add the header.png and the CCL.png image to the wiki these can be found as attachments on previous issues. I downloaded them to my computer and just attach them each week
|-

| Gather news articles in <nowiki>[[https://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0AdKZelXU8Y2LZGNrcHRkYmhfODlkODNxNnRnZA&hl=en|the Google Doc]]</nowiki>
| Throughout the week, gather news articles for each section, see <nowiki>[[UbuntuWeeklyNewsletter-LinkSuggestions]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuWeeklyNewsletter/IssueTemplate?action=raw|view raw text of IssueTemplate]]</nowiki> for resources for other sections
|-

|-

| 11
| Email editors to proof issue
| Email editors as soon as summaries are done! (shared Google Doc has  addresses and form email) This should take at least 30 mins to critically proof.
