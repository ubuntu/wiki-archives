== US Teams Wiki Doc Day 2009 ==

On the weekend of '''2nd - 4th Oct 2009''' LoCoTeams around the world will be celebrating the UbuntuGlobalJam.

Now is your chance to be part of it! In addition to any formal <nowiki>[[UbuntuGlobalJam-Events|events]]</nowiki> your team may be having, we want to see your wiki updated! This is something you can do individually, communicating with other team members online.

Your wiki all up to date? Help us update and expand the <nowiki>[[USTeams]]</nowiki> wiki!

Want more to do? The LoCoTeams wikis have a wealth of information but could use some help with organizing.

So join us on our US Docs portion of the UbuntuGlobalJam!

Add your team here:

 {*} FloridaTeam

 {*} NorthCarolinaTeam

 {*} PennsylvaniaTeam

 {*} ArizonaTeam

 {*} CaliforniaTeam

Then join us in #ubuntu-us on chat.freenode.net to share with us what you're working on :)
