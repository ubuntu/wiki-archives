=== In the Press ===

==== Why Canonical’s Snap-Based Immutable Ubuntu Is a Good Idea ====

Matt Milano firstly mentions that "Immutability and snaps are two of the most controversial elements" but that Ubuntu "may achieve a winning formula" with both combined. We're reminded what these are, and the advantages they provide. In summary we're told this "significantly simplifies the process for users".

==== KDE Plasma's KRunner is a handy tool: How and why you should be using it ====

Jack Wallen tells us KDE Plasma contains exactly what users need from a desktop, with many 'tricks up its sleeve' one of which is KRunner. We're given a list of what KRunner can do, and why it's so useful, before being walked through how it can be used (including screenshots).

=== In the Blogosphere ===

==== Intel GDS/Downfall Linux Mitigation Updated To Confirm All Skylake CPUs Are Affected ====

Michael Larabel writes about the Intel Gather Data Sampling (GDS) "Downfall" vulnerability which impacts all Skylake and Kabylake CPUs. As a result of the Skylake processors reaching end of official support by Intel, Intel didn't disclose them as impacted, and thus the original Linux mitigation didn't protect these processors. We're told a new patch has been queued to mark all "Skylake (and Kabylake) CPUs as vulnerable to Downfall". Thanks to Michael Zhivich is given for noticing the missing details from Intel's disclosures.
