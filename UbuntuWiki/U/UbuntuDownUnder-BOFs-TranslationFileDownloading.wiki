=== Introduction ===

At any time, a Launchpad member can download the translations for a package or upstream product in one or more languages. To do this, you select a package or product, version, language or languages, and whether you want to include unreviewed translations.

Because the translation tarball often takes minutes to prepare, instead of responding to the selection with the download itself, Rosetta tells you that it will e-mail you with a link to the download when it is ready.
