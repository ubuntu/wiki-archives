=== Summary ===

In TheHatchery, we have cases where text is entered in a textarea control, where the user may make use of blank lines to signify paragraphs. At the time of writing, this whitespace is not rendered in HTML, so the paragraph formatting is lost. To fix this, paragraphs should be rendered as HTML `<p>` elements and lines as HTML `<div>` elements.
