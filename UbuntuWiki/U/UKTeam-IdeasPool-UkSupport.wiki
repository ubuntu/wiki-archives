=== Overview ===

Have a ubuntu uk support channel on IRC

=== Detail ===

A number of people in the #ubuntu-uk irc channel want support, although we do support people, the channel isn't dedicated to support.  Rather than push people away to #ubuntu, have a uk centric support channel so members can support if they want to.  This way people will come back to #ubuntu-uk rather than think, they won't help i'm not going there.

=== Resources Required ===

People.  I've created #ubuntu-uk-support on irc.freenode.net [although i can remove this at anytime]
