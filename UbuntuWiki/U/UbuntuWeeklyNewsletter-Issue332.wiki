Pope writes that as Ubuntu Touch 13.10 is due to be released in October the need to get core functionality across all core apps production-quality by the release date is essential.  Apps will be paired each day to get through all 12 in half the time.  This will also give participants a choice of which app to work on.

Jon Brodkin of Ars Technica writes that Ubuntu will be one of the first operating systems offered on VMware's infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS). This vCloud Hybrid Service is set to go live in September and will feature Ubuntu 12.04 along with more recent versions up through the upcoming 13.10 when release. vCloud Hybrid Service will charge customers based on usage of resources.

==== Canonical looking to tap Dell to promote Chinese version of Ubuntu OS ====

Michael Kan, IDG News Service, writes that Dell and Canonical are discussing releasing a version of Ubuntu intended to be supported by the Chinese government. This version of Ubuntu will be made available as a pre-installed OS on Dell's upcoming products destined for the Chinese market. Leonard Tsai, Canonical’s Asia Pacific president stated that the two companies are discussing using the Ubuntu``Kylin OS. Released in April, Ubuntu``Kylin OS had reached over 70,000 downloads by July. The next version of Ubuntu``Kylin 13.10 will be released in October.

==== Ubuntu Touch First Take: OS convergence comes into focus ====

Terry Relph-Knight of ZDNet writes that Canonical’s plans to merge Ubuntu Edge, the Ubuntu SDK, with thinking from the Edge Project, by April 2014. The idea is to have operating systems for different types of devices into a single code base as long as the user experience on any one, or all, of those devices isn’t compromised. The Touch Developer Preview has much of the eventual User Experience of the fully converged Ubuntu 14.04, while the Edge shows how a phone might double as the basis of a desktop system.

=== In The Blogosphere ===

==== Ubuntu 12.04.3 system update in visual review ====
Peter Chubb of PR (Product Reviews) reports some of the latest changes to Ubuntu 12.04.3, which he describes as “not a simple update.”  Some changes include the Linux Kernel upgrade from 3.2 to 3.8, improved gaming on Steam, and many more.

http://www.product-reviews.net/2013/08/27/ubuntu-12-04-3-system-update-in-visual-review/

==== Ubuntu Working Towards Intel Rapid Start Support ====

Michael Larabel of Phoronix writes that with the upcoming Linux 3.11 kernel there is basic support for Intel Rapid Start Technology which allows for systems to resume from deep sleep in about five seconds and says that it's still not clean and easy to setup for end-users. The Ubuntu Rapid Start session at the virtual Ubuntu Developer Summit centered around the matter of having support in the Ubuntu Installer for being able to identify systems supported by Rapid Start.  Michael refers those wanting to find out more details on Ubuntu's plans for Rapid Start to the embedded Google Hangout video of the session.

==== Unity 8 updated with fancy coverflow view ====

razvi of iloveubuntu writes that Unity 8 has been updated, "introducing (enabling) a coverflow-like view for its Unity Videos lens, rendering videos from the My Videos category with a carousel-like rendering type; the result: big-sized thumbnails are now so-beautifully populating the Videos lens, generating elegance, modernism and good-looks into the fancy Unity 8." razvi provides a number of screenshots and reminds us that Unity 8 is available for testing via Ubuntu 13.10's Ubuntu Software Center.

==== Ubuntu Is Close To Recommending 64-Bit By Default ====

Michael Larabel of Phoronix relates that while x86_64 hardware has been very common for years the Ubuntu download pages have continued to recommend the 32-bit version for new desktop installations. Michael goes on to say that with most PCs now supporting x86_64/AMD64, there really is no reason to not be using the 64-bit flavor assuming you have at least 1~2GB of RAM and refers those that want to learn more about the latest 64-bit Ubuntu Linux proposal, which was made at the latest virtual Ubuntu Developer Summit, to summit.ubuntu.com.

==== Ubuntu One Set-Up Added to Ubuntu 13.10 Installer ====

==== Hobby Engineering in Ubuntu Linux ====

Jeremy Cook discusses hobby engineering in Ubuntu Linux.  He describes using Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and PyMCU under Ubuntu.  Though ultimately he was led to switch back to Microsoft because he wanted a better video-editing package than Linux had to natively offer because CAD is his main tool as a Mechanical Engineer and concludes “For hobbyists, especially those with a computer near the end of its useful life, I would definitely recommend at least trying Ubuntu out.”
