=== Welcome to the 200th Issue of UWN ===

Welcome to the Ubuntu Weekly Newsletter, '''Issue 200 for the week June 27 - July 3rd, 2010.'''

The purpose of this newsletter is to let everyone know what is happening in all the different corners of the vast Ubuntu community. It's a snapshot of the Ubuntu Community one week at a time.

The first issue was unleashed June 4th, 2006, and a little over four (4) years and seven (7) releases later UWN and the Ubuntu Community continues to mature and grow together.

The Ubuntu News Team, which includes both UWN and Fridge, continues to report what happens, effects, and relates to the the vast and ever growing Ubuntu community, including information from the different teams, Lo``Cos, forums, mailing lists, IRC universe, and newsworthy press coverage and blogs. A very important and helpful contribution many Lo``Co Teams continue to do is spread the news by translating UWN.

It has undoubtedly been a fun and rewarding experience for all involved!

We would like to thank all our readers for your continued support and feedback and encourage you to keep sending the Ubuntu News Team your comments and corrections (yes, we do make mistakes!).

with gratitude, appreciation, and excitment!

''--The Ubuntu News Team''

=== History ===

Before the UWN, there were several other publications that kept the community up to date. Benjamin Mako Hill published the first Ubuntu Traffic 27 August 2004. Ubuntu Traffic was modeled after Kernel Traffic, and even used the same software. It was focused on summaries of major wiki pages, IRC, and mailing list. Mako published it weekly by himself, usually taking about a day to do. Every message sent to every Ubuntu list was read, but soon became very difficult as the community grew. The last issue of Ubuntu Traffic was released 04 February 2005.

Soon, different teams took it on themselves to improve communication internally and to communicate better with the rest of the project and followed the newsletter model to do that. Vincent Untz published the first Ubuntu Desktop Newsletter in December 2005, followed by the Ubuntu Documentation Newsletter, Kubuntu Newsletter, and Edubuntu Newsletter.

Creating separate newsletters became unwieldy quickly. All the newsletters were brought back under one roof when Matt Galvin released the first issue of the UWN on 04 June 2006.

The UWN archives can be found at:  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuWeeklyNewsletter/Archive

=== 200th Issue Interviews ===

For the 200th Issue of UWN, Amber Graner interviews Mark Shuttleworth, Jane Silber, Joey Stanford, and Jorge Castro for their comments, reflections, and suggestions for and about the Ubuntu Weekly Newsletter.

Amber asks each person the following questions:

* Do you read the Ubuntu Weekly Newsletter?  If yes, for how long? If no, what can we, the Ubuntu News Team do to improve it so that you would find it beneficial to read?

* What section do you read first and why?

* What service does it provide to you personally? What benefit do you see that it provides to Ubuntu? Canonical? Other areas of FOSS?

* Since this is the 200th Issue of the Ubuntu Weekly Newsletter, in your opinion what has been the biggest change in it's evolution to what it is today that you have seen?  What as been the most surprising?

* If you could improve one area of the Ubuntu Weekly Newsletter what section would it be and why?

* The Ubuntu News Team is very much a work in progress as we are always looking for ways to improve the service we provide to all readers.  What would you like to see the Ubuntu Weekly Newsletter evolve into over the next 100 Issues (roughly 4 cycles)?

* When the Ubuntu Weekly Newsletter was first started by Benjamin "Mako" Hill in 2004 under the name Ubuntu Traffic it was a Canonical driven project for the Community.  Over time it it has evolved to a Community driven project.  Do you see other Canonical initiated projects going via this route? If so, why is this important and can you hint as to which projects you might like to see this happen with?

* Is there anything else you would like to tell the Ubuntu Weekly Newsletter readers and staff?

Mark and Jane's interviews were via email as Joey, and Jorge's were recorded. So if you're curious about the answers the go to:

==== Ubuntu User Days - Scheduled for July 10-11, 2010 ====

Just a reminder that Ubuntu User Days will be held on July 10-11, 2010.

The Ubuntu User Days wiki page describes Ubuntu User Days as:

User Days was created to be a set of courses offered during a one day period to teach the beginning or intermediate Ubuntu user the basics to get them started with Ubuntu. User Days is a series of online courses where you can:

* learn how to install Ubuntu
* find equivalent programs in Ubuntu
* learn how to get help
* learn the basics of how to use Ubuntu
* learn how to get involved in the community

This is the second Ubuntu User Days Events to take place and is growing in popularity.

Want to know how you can participate in Ubuntu User days then go to:

http://www.ubuntu-user.com/Online/Blogs/Amber-Graner-You-in-Ubuntu/Ubuntu-User-Days-Scheduled-for-July-10-11-2010

==== Welcome Alessandro Ghersi (lex79) to kubuntu-dev ====

The Kubuntu developers have approved, 5 votes to zero, Alessandro's
application to join kubuntu-dev.  Please join me in welcoming him to the team
and encouraging him to keep up the great work he's doing.

This also (should) make Alessandro a member of ubuntu-dev, although it appears
there is a bit of adjustment in Launchpad needed to make this formally true.
Alessandro is the first member of kubuntu-dev who had not become a MOTU first (I
understand he does also plan to take this step).

==== Translations Advocacy ====

David Planella of the Ubuntu Community Team, discusses why translation efforts in Ubuntu are important.  David explains, "Translations are a key part of the Ubuntu community, with deep roots in our Ubuntu philosophy. For many users having an operating system in their language is the only way they’ll be able to use it (*), so it is just natural that we support this and provide tools to lower the barrier to community translations. Others might be proficient in English and be able to use Ubuntu without natural language support, but still choose to work with it in their language."

David says, "I think this work is just awesome, and I think everyone should get to know about this effort, which does not only enable more people to use Ubuntu, but also makes possible such other amazing stories as keeping an indigenous language alive in our digital age orbeing the only operating system available in a particular language."

David goes on to encourage translators "to blog more on the Planet, tweet/dent about what you and your team is doing and basically spread the word. Translation jams, translation status, areas where help is needed, what you like or don’t like about working with Launchpad Translations, or even explaining a bit more about your language… there is a whole range of interesting topics to talk about."

To find out more about how you can help with translations, why it's important and even participate in an experiment to help you get some hands on understanding of why translations efforts are important got to:

==== Help wanted: Testing programs that use the notification area ====

Matthew Paul Thomas disscusses testing the notification area and where users can help.

He states, "Two months ago I wrote about how Ubuntu is phasing out the notification area.

An important part of this work is surveying Ubuntu applications that use the notification area, working out what they should do instead, and fixing them."

Matthew asks, "So if you have a few spare minutes, please choose one of the programs on the list, install it from Ubuntu Software Center, study how it uses and mentions the notification area, and add your notes to the wiki page."

To find out more about how and where your help is needed in this testing process go to:

http://design.canonical.com/2010/06/help-wanted-notification-area/

==== ubuntu-jobs@lists.ubuntu.com mailing list ====

Recently https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-jobs was created to inform the community about Ubuntu-related jobs from Canonical, but also as a way for employers seeking an Ubuntu specialist . Please note that this is an announce-only list.

An explanatory post from the Canonical HR department:

 ''Dear Friends,''

 . ''At Canonical we pride ourselves in our determination to be the best not only in the products and software we produce but with the people who make this company great and the way we reach out to new talent.''

 .''Most companies only let you know when they have jobs available on a careers web site and you never hear from them at any other time.   We on the other hand, a growing company in an ever expanding community, want to try to create something different and believe that with your help we can.''

 . ''We are launching a mailing list with the aim of keeping you up to date with new roles as they arise at Canonical and possibly other Ubuntu related roles.  Periodically there will be career profiles and articles we feel may be of value to you in your quest for your ideal job.''

 . ''To join the list go to: https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-jobs''

 . ''We recognize that our company is incredibly unique and has a way of doing things what will appeal to many, we also believe our employee brand has the potential to be one of the best in the world and this is just one way to tell you about it.''

 . ''We hope that by signing up to this mailing list you'll have the opportunity to get to know us in a way that is not usually available to someone outside the business.''

 . ''This is an announce only mailing list, as always if you are interested in a career at Canonical please check out our jobs at: http://webapps.ubuntu.com/employment/ ''

 . ''We look forward to you joining our mailing list and hope that you find it a useful way of staying in touch with us.''

==== loco.ubuntu.com meeting ====

'''If you haven’t seen loco.ubuntu.com yet, then go to: http://loco.ubuntu.com .'''

It’s what we call the Lo``Co Directory and where more and more data of our Local Community teams goes. In the beginning we started with just a simple list of Lo``Co teams and additional data they can put there. After some time we added the functionality to put events in there too. It’s awesome and the work the whole team put into it is just amazing. The good thing is that we all hang out in #ubuntu-locoteams, do code reviews together and learn from each other. It’s a fantastic project.

To continue the great story and plan our next steps a bit, we’ll meet in #ubuntu-meeting (irc.freenode.net) on July 8th, 14:00 UTC.

Topics we’d like to talk about:
* explain <nowiki>[[http://launchpad.net/loco-directory|the project]]</nowiki> to new interested contributors
* review the <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/loco-directory|list of open bugs]]</nowiki> and reprioritise for the next 2 or 3 releases
* general Q&A

If you know a bit about Django, Python, Web development or are keen to learn about it and be part of a fantastic project that powers a great and fantastic part of our community, be there and talk to us.

(Also if you microblog about this and other Lo``Co stuff, use the #locoteams hashtag.)

==== Rubén Romero: Drupal usage within the Ubuntu Community ====

Rubén has submitted a session to Drupalcon Copenhagen 2010 which will focus on how the Ubuntu Community uses Drupal in nearly all areas of web presence from it's main website to Lo``Co teams as well as marketing sites such as Spread``Ubuntu.

Rubén asks the community for help in making his session great. If you have deployed Drupal on Ubuntu or set up a Drupal community site then please take a moment to give Rubén feedback on your experience with Drupal.

To find out more information about Rubén's session and how you can give feedback go to:

http://huayra.wordpress.com/2010/07/03/drupal-usage-within-the-ubuntu-community/

==== Colin Watson: GRUB 2: With luck... ====

Colin uploaded a new GRUB 2 package that uses more reliable disk identification when being configured. It also provides simplified debconf questions, avoiding a situation where a user may have accidentally chosen an option which could render a Windows system unbootable.

Other improvements in this version include further documentation work, video improvements, improved UEFI support, automatic configuration support for Fedora 13 and Linux on Xen as well as skipping LVM snapshots instead of failing when they are present.

For more information on Colin's new GRUB 2 package go to:

http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/ucgi/~cjwatson/blosxom/2010/07/02#2010-07-02-grub2-with-luck

==== Jorge Castro: Application Menu status update for 2 July ====

Jorge informs us of a new update of indicator-appmenu and appmenu-gtk that's available in canonical-dx-team PPA for Maverick and Lucid.

* We’re now on by default for UNE in Maverick. (Thanks didrocks and seb128!)
* Adding a new utility to make a mock application
* After you use the dump tool you can now use mockjsonapp to create a test app with the dump data.
* This makes it much easier to debug (this how Ted fixed the gimp menus)
* If an app is being problematic providing a menu dump is the easiest way to provide Ted with the data he needs to fix the menu: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DesktopExperienceTeam/ApplicationMenu#DebugTools
* The big grid of moin death has been removed from the wiki page as it’s hard to keep up to date and we’ve got more detail in the bug reports anyway.
* Cody has a bunch of other fixes for appmenu-gtk on hand, Ted will be reviewing them today so you might see some bugs closed that you won’t see released until next Thursday.

For more information on Application Menu go to:

==== Brett Alton: Local School Board and Ubuntu ====

Brett discusses the pros and cons of a school board that has begun to use Open Source software. Brett notes that according to the school board's Manager of Information Technology, [The school Board] "added Firefox and OpenOffice.org to their default list of programs on their Windows images, although Internet Explorer and Microsoft Office are still the default."

Why is this important to Ubuntu?  Brett goes on to mention, "I want to state that last summer they [The School Board] implemented a system using N-Computing devices that allow one computer to turn into four terminals (saving money through lower energy costs and Windows licenses) and experimented with creating Ubuntu images pre-installed with Edubuntu-type programs, like GCompris.

To find our more about the issues the school board is facing in their experiment with Ubuntu and more go to:

==== Jonathan Jesse: Review of Kubuntu Netbook – Maverick Alpha 2 ====

Jonathan has a Dell Mini 9 and has been switching between Ubuntu Netbook, Ubuntu Unity also Kubuntu Netbook Edition.  In this blog post he reviews the Kubuntu Netbook Edition.

Jonathan describes how he used a virtual machine to install the Kubuntu Netbook Edition and provides screenshots with his descriptions.

==== Randall Ross: Dropping the "L" Word ====

Randall shares his opinion on Linux and Ubuntu branding and how it's still very common for a typical user to get confused with the different concepts.

He also believes that Linux is not the brand that will take FLOSS to the mainstream, "Despite its standing with Innovators and Early Adopters, 'Linux' is not the brand that will carry the day and take FLOSS mainstream. That chance currently rests with the complete operating system called Ubuntu provided we can clear the confusion and cross the chasm."

Randal provides some thought provoking comments and links.  To read Randall's full post go to:

==== Dustin Kirkland: Creating Ubuntu Server Disk Images using vmbuilder ====

Dustin covers a script called vmbuilder that can be used to build bootable server images. This can be quite useful in cases where many servers have to be installed in a short amount of time where deploying pre-built images would be faster than doing a pre-seeded installation.

He provides a complete howto on this and he'll also be covering live-helper which can do similar tasks in a subsequent post.

==== TurnKey Linux Beta Launches Byobu by Default at Login ====

Dustin Kirkland writes, "Turn``Key Linux is a Canonical Cloud Partner that provides Ubuntu-based Virtual Machine appliances. Alon Swartz of Turn``Key recently announced the release of Turn``Key Core Beta, re-based on Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, and should release an official version shortly after Ubuntu 10.04.1 is generally available."

Dustin goes to to note that, "Turn``Key has a real focus on user-friendliness, excellent defaults, and the user's first-run experience. Thus, I was excited to see this bullet in his Turn``Key Core Lucid Beta announcement:

User friendly screen wrapper (byobu) launched by default on login."

Dustin also discusses why he likes this idea, "I think this is a great idea, as I have proposed as much at the last couple of Ubuntu Developer Summits. Ciemon Dunville has filed a bug, suggesting that the Maverick Ubuntu Server install should also default to launching Byobu. The output of the latest UDS session was that "we might consider doing this, if enough Ubuntu server users are asking us for it.""
