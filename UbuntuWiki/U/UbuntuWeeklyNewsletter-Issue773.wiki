==== LoCo council and loco teams resurrection ====

Bhavanishankar Ravindra writes about the Local Community portal and Lo``Co Council which haven't been active for some time. He hopes to 'rejig' both, and asks for anyone with ideas, or would like to contribute with him on this purpose to leave a reply with their ideas & thoughts.

==== About `apt upgrade` and phased updates ====

Sally Makin documents phased updates that are now used by Ubuntu systems. We are shown an example message we may see due to phased updates, and told why this change is actually a good thing, requiring no change from us. We are told security updates are never phased, with a brief discussion on how we could bypass the phasing quickly, or disable them. We are reminded this isn't a new feature, but is more widely used now, along with a brief discussion of how it works, with links if we want more details too.
