=== Joining The Team ===
Don't be afraid to join us. Lojban gurus are rare, so we are just trying to do the translation task with an open cage of untrained monkeys who consult lojban.org three times per translated word.

Joining requires creating an account to Launchpad development environment. The team itself is open for anyone to join and doesn't currently require confirmation from a team leader or member.

* Create a Launchpad account at https://launchpad.net/+login

=== Communicating With Other Team Members ===
We recommend chating on #lojban irc channel in freenode network. We may some day move to another channel, if necessary.
