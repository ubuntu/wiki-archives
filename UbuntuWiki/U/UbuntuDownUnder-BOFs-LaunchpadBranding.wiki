=== Introduction ===

This BOF is proposed to discuss how Launchpad should be presented to the community and future users - i.e., should we develop a single Launchpad brand, develop separate Rosetta, Malone, Soyuz brands (and if so, how tightly linked from a brand perspective), or develop Launchpad and the component parts as brands?

This is not intended to be a review of logos and colours, although that will follow as action items once the strategy has been clarified.

=== Rationale ===

Launchpad is beginning to receive a fair amount of community attention and as the component subsystems are growing, it is time to establish, protect and build their identity.

=== Scope and Use Cases ===

=== Implementation Plan ===

==== Data Preservation and Migration ====

==== Packages Affected ====

==== User Interface Requirements ====

=== Outstanding Issues ===
