==== Ubuntu 6.06 LTS Desktop Edition reaches end-of-life ====

Ubuntu 6.06 LTS Desktop will reach end of life on Tuesday, July 14, 2009.  At that time, Ubuntu Security Notices will no longer include information or updated packages for the Ubuntu 6.06 LTS Desktop.  Server Edition will continue to receive maintenance updates through June 2011.  The supported upgrade path from Ubuntu 6.06 LTS is via Ubuntu 8.04 LTS.  Instructions and caveats for the upgrade may be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HardyUpgrades. For further Ubuntu support, including commercial support options, see http://www.ubuntu.com/support.

==== Call for testing: KVM in Jaunty proposed ====

There is a package in jaunty-proposed[1] that needs to be pushed to jaunty-updates before the Hardy and Intrepid backports can take place. In order to promote the package to jaunty-updates, Dustin Kirkland need users to verify that the new package fixes the four bugs that he thinks it fixes, and does not cause regressions.

=== LoCo News ===

==== Ubuntu LoCo Systems admin lessons: Massachusetts LoCo ====

This has been some time in coming but Doctor``Mo has announce that the Ubuntu Massachusetts Lo``Co will be running an event every Wednesday 7pm-9pm(Local time) at the South End Technology Center with the aim to teach budding new Ubuntu systems administrators how to best administrate an Ubuntu Server and Desktop network. Event Link: http://www.ubuntu-massachusetts.com/events/4/

The lessons are free and are student driven, with teachers on hand to guide, answer questions and start off each section. Each student is expected to learn in their own time and pick up each section as they pass the previous, and prior requirements are existing Ubuntu Desktop experience and familiarity with computers. The lessons do not provide certification or any other official qualification, but will be heavily practical.

This will be in addition to the existing successful Learn Ubuntu Desktop sessions we do on Tuesday evenings but aimed at students who want to go further into the field of systems administration. Computer support and other queries will not be dealt with and people needing Ubuntu help should continue to come on Tuesdays. http://www.ubuntu-massachusetts.com/events/1/

=== Launchpad News ===

==== git-imports ====

As you might have heard already, Launchpad can now import code from Git repositories. You can then create Bazaar branches of those Git repos.

For example:

bzr branch lp:git

Thanks to Jelmer for bzr-git (https://launchpad.net/bzr-git) and Michael & Paul for tying it into our rock-solid import system.

=== Ubuntu Forums News ===

==== Tutorial of the Week ====

tinivole (http://ubuntuforums.org/member.php?u=490875, a moderator on the forums) has put together all the instructions to solve problems when using NVIDIA video cards of the 8400 series and up. He is actively supporting his tutorial and many people have given input. Debugging steps are suggested if all does not go as per the book, as well as reverting the changes and going back to the ubuntu supported drivers.

The tutorial, How``To: NVIDIA 185.18 Drivers in Ubuntu, is located here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1125400

Enjoy and see you soon!

==== Ubuntu Community Interviews ====

This week, please meet panickedthumb (http://ubuntuforums.org/member.php?u=1132), who joined the forums in October, 2004 and has been a moderator since November, same year. He started with Ubuntu when the distribution did not have a name, yet, and has never looked back. He also started and co-admins the Virginia Ubuntu Lo``Co team. Travis is very fun to work with and hosts part of the forums memory. Well done, PT!

==== The Ubuntu Museum ====

Earlier, Steve Langasek reminded us that Ubuntu 6.06 LTS (Dapper Drake) reaches its end of support on the desktop next week (July 14, 2009). So, it's time for a little nostalgia!

As the maintainer of Ubuntu's KVM package, Dustin Kirkland has spend quite a bit of his time regression testing the virtualization stack (kvm, qemu, libvirt, virt-manager, etc). In doing so, he has constructed a massive archive of virtual machine images.

About 6 months ago, Jamie Strandboge and Dustin kicked around the idea of creating a series of "Linux museums", honoring our heritage by providing download-able virtual appliance images that could run under KVM. Jamie is currently working on something like this for Debian's releases.

Dustin is pleased to introduce his contribution...The Ubuntu Museum! Here: http://people.ubuntu.com/%7Ekirkland/Museum/

*** screenshots (png) of each Ubuntu desktop release
*** screencasts (mpeg) of each Ubuntu boot and shutdown sequence
*** virtual machine images (bzip2, qcow2) of each retired Ubuntu desktop release

The virtual machine images are:

*** default i386 desktop installations
*** with all packages updated to their final resting state
*** the username and password are both "ubuntu"

Obviously, these releases are completely unsupported and the images are provided for entertainment and educational purposes only!

Since Dustin started using Ubuntu with the Breezy release, he found it quite educational to play around with Warty and Hoary--a bit of Ubuntu history he was missing. It was interesting to see the evolution of the artwork and color schemes. He found some strange satisfaction hitting a few old, memorable bugs and then thinking "boy am I glad we fixed that!" It is also pretty cool to see how much we've improved startup and shutdown times.

Dustin recently attended an excellent presentation by Colin Watson on the history of the Debian and Ubuntu installers. Colin made the point that it's important to know where we've been, when we're trying to figure out where we're going.

Hopefully some of you will enjoy this trip down memory lane and perhaps learn something too!

http://blog.dustinkirkland.com/2009/07/ubuntu-museum.html

==== Karmic Wallpapers ====

Ubuntu would like to include a beautiful set of images for our users to choose from in our next release. In order to accomplish this we have set up a wiki page to explain things and guidelines for inclusion. In addition we've started a flickr group to attract current flickr users and encourage new contributors to step up and take the plunge. If you have amazing photos which you would like to share with the world, please add them to the list!

=== In The Press ===

==== Ubuntu's maker: Chrome OS 'no slam dunk' just because Google announces it ====

Ubuntu's maker, Canonical Ltd., is defiant that it can maintain its edge in the desktop Linux space despite Google Inc.'s upcoming Chrome operating system. Google may possess brand recognition and engineering resources that dwarf the 200-employee, reported $30-million-yearly-revenue Canonical, but Chrome OS's ascent "is no slam dunk just because you make an announcement," says Gerry Carr, marketing manager for Canonical. Carr told Computerworld today that building a user-friendly operating system is "harder than putting a new feature on a search engine."

==== Koala will be 'a definitive shift' for Ubuntu Linux ====

Linux Format Magazine did an interview of Mark Shuttleworth in which he answers questions about Karmic Koala and beyond. The questions are listed below, with Mark's answers at the link.

* Do you have big goals for the next 10 releases? You're dictator for life – is it really life, or like the British penal system where you get off after six years?
* The GNU Hurd?
* We're looking forward to Koala. You've said that 'boot will be beautiful' – care to explain more?
* Are you thinking of Plymouth or something else entirely?
* One of the most talked about things so far is the retention of 'no brown'. Are you thinking greens?
* Presumably, you're not going back to the controversial semi-naked people approach?
* We talked to Steve Mc``Intyre recently (Debian's Project Leader) and he says he has a great relationship with the guys at Canonical. Do you think there's more work to do to streamline the flow from upstream?
* Elsewhere upstream, Greg Kroah-Hartman gave an interesting speech at the Kernel Summit 2008. He said there were 100 kernel patches in the last three years from Canonical, putting you in 79th position…

==== Ubuntu’s Jono Bacon: Open Source Code Priority Should Begin at Security, then Quality, then Performance ====

Coverity.com recently interviewed Ubuntu Community Manager Jono Bacon. When asked what brings thousands of contributors and hundreds of teams together Bacon said, "Ubuntu has a solid desktop, a good server and mobile experience and an exceptionally large community that refines, extends and supports us." Bacon was also asked about how security and quality have scaled as Ubuntu's size has grown. "Ubuntu takes quality and security very seriously. On one hand, we have definitive processes to manage security expectations including our Bug Triage best practice, our Stable Release Update policy, our ‘proposed’ updates and more." Be sure to check out the article for the rest of Coverity.com's interview with Jono Bacon.

==== Windows 7 is the same as Ubuntu ====

ZD``Net's Christopher Dawson titled this article "Windows 7 is the same as Ubuntu", but says that obviously this isn't true. Their underlying architectures are quite a bit different, Gnome looks different than the 7 UI, etc., but to an average 17-year-old, there just wasn’t any meaningful difference between the two operating systems. Dawson's son has been running Ubuntu 9.04 on his computer for a while, so Christopher thought he'd install the Windows 7 release candidate to get his son's impressions. Dawson managed to extract from his son that his favorite feature was that he was able to use his Zune with it, which is something that had never worked terribly well with Ubuntu. Otherwise, he said, “Windows 7 is the same as Ubuntu; there just really isn’t anything different about them.” Of course there isn’t. He lives in a web browser. The underlying OS is irrelevant. For the average student the old Windows vs. Mac vs. Linux debate may finally be dead. For someone who “hated Linux” a year ago to now happily switch between Windows 7 and Ubuntu in a completely transparent way certainly signals an end to that age-old flame war.

==== Jono Bacon on the Value of Good Communities ====

James Turner of O'Reilly.com notes that Ubuntu has enjoyed fantastic success over the past few years, becoming one of the dominant Linux distributions, and the distribution of choice for netbooks. Jono Bacon's job is to make sure that that success continues, by keeping the huge Ubuntu developer community happy and productive. Turner caught up with Jono in advance of his appearance at OSCON, the O'Reilly Open Source Convention, and he was more than happy to talk about the efforts underway to not only improve the Ubuntu community, but also bring together other communities, such as Gnome and KDE, to help them work better together. "My job is to encourage and to enable the global Ubuntu community to do good work that's productive and that they enjoy doing themselves."

==== Smoother Transitions to Ubuntu With Virtual Machines and Wubi ====

The Linux Loop recognizes that no matter how simple you can make it, installaing a new OS will always be a daunting task for most computer users, especially on a machine they depend on every day. Assuming that not everyone has that geeky neighbor who goes door to door installing Linux on people’s computers, there has to be a better way. They feel that while the Live CD and Live USB options are good, the best way is through a virtual machine using Virtual``Box or Wubi. Separately, these are all good ways of trying Ubuntu out, but together as a process they are an absolutely killer feature. "It’s less important exactly what methods of trying Ubuntu exist than how seamless the process of testing it out and then installing it can be made."

http://www.linuxloop.com/2009/07/09/smoother-transitions-to-ubuntu-with-virtual-machines-and-wubi/

==== What to expect from the next version of Ubuntu ====

Tech Radar's Graham Morrison says that the great thing about Linux distro development, when compared with OS X or Vista, is that the whole process is transparent. You can see at any stage what the developers are planning, and even download the latest build of your favourite distribution. Ubuntu is no different, and the next version, out in October, is going to be called the Karmic Koala. In a battle for enterprise-grade computing, Ubuntu 9.10 will include Eucalyptus which is a computing platform that enables you to dynamically scale applications across a network of transparent computers running in the cloud on your own hardware. One of the most popular cloud computing services is Amazon's EC2. If you're looking for something a little more superficial, we've also been promised a palette makeover to the desktop. Mark Shuttleworth has been noncommittal on the complete abandonment of brown, but it does seem likely that the standard Gnome desktop in Karma will look significantly different.

=== In The Blogosphere ===

==== Is Google Stealing Ubuntu’s Thunder? ====

Joe Panettieri of Works With U looks at the new competition along with the old competition to Ubuntu.  Already facing Google Android and Intel Moblin, along with the competition from Red Hat and Novell and, of course, Windows 7 coming out in October, 2009, now Google is announcing Chrome OS for netbooks. So far, it would appear that Dell is sticking with Ubuntu for netbooks, notebooks and PCs.

http://www.workswithu.com/2009/07/08/is-google-stealing-ubuntus-thunder/

==== Mono Now Safe? ====

Patrick Regan of Works With U, after his disclaimer of not being a lawyer, takes on the thorny question of Mono. Microsoft’s Community Promise only applies to implementations that fully comply with the given specification before releasing. ASP.NET, ADO.NET, Windows.Forms, and others are not covered under the Community Promise. In response to this, the Mono project is going to split their code up into two different pieces.One that is just the implementation of the two specifications covered by today’s announcement, and another with all the uncovered technologies.  Most of the C#/Mono projects that are included in Ubuntu and others do not use the higher technologies that are not covered by the Community Promise. This means that packages like Tomboy are most likely safe from legal threats.

http://www.workswithu.com/2009/07/07/mono-now-safe/

==== Stop piling on Mono already ====

Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols, Cyber Cynic for Computer``World, would like people to "get a grip".  It only makes sense to him that open-source developers should work on projects that help with Windows/Linux interoperability. His position is that if people feel that programs like Tomboy and Banshee shouldn't be written with Mono, then they should re-write the code in some other language/framework.

http://blogs.computerworld.com/stop_piling_on_mono_already

==== KDE 4.3 RC1 in Kubuntu 9.04 - Overview & Screenshots ====

Craciun Dan, writing for Tux``Arena, presents screenshots and comments on the new KDE 4.3 RC1 as installed in Kubuntu 9.04.  He's not particularly happy with the new look of Plasma (now called Air).  According to the announcement[1] on the KDE official website, this release got many Plasma improvements, several game updates, Policy``Kit integration, and several other changes or improvements.

==== Ubuntu Sets Example by Defying Mono Threats ====

Christopher Tozzi, of Works With U, takes a stand with the Ubuntu Technical Board that Ubuntu should continue making use of Mono and Mono-developed applications like Tomboy and F-Spot.  It is his contention that, since no legal action has been taken against developers, distributions or end users, that we shouldn't be paniced by just the possible threat of such action.  He also feels that Ubuntu is leading the way by taking such a stand in favour of innovation and the advancement of free software.

http://www.workswithu.com/2009/07/06/ubuntu-sets-example-by-defying-mono-threats/

==== Dell is sticking with Ubuntu ====

Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols, Cyber Cynic for Computer``World, went looking to find out whether the rumors about Dell and Desktop Linux offerings were true.  He feels that the rumors started when people noticed that Dell's Desktop PC offerings no longer listed Linux as an option.  After contacting Anne Camden, a Dell spokesperson, he found that they are transitioning to a current generation of desktop models, and that the page should be updated soon.

http://blogs.computerworld.com/dell_is_sticking_with_ubuntu

==== How Chrome OS Will Help Ubuntu ====

Christopher Tozzi, of Works With U, feels that Google Chrome OS will follow the same path that other netbook Linux offerings have taken:  that confirmed Windows users will be upset that their favorite programs won't run on it.  However, due to Google's prominent visual position in the world, the fact that they're offering something OTHER than a Microsoft OS will show people that there really are other operating systems than just Microsoft and Apple.

=== Meeting Summaries ===

==== Ubuntu Server Team Meeting: July 7th ====

Here are the minutes of the meeting. They can also be found online
with the irc logs here.

* ubuntu-tips: nijaba added more rules to the server tips wiki page. The main rules are that tips should not be any longer than 2 lines of 80 characters and they should be relevant to packages in main.

* Merges: kirkland reminded that Debian Import Freeze was in effect and that the goal was to get all of the outstanding merges done by Feature Freeze on August 27. Working on merges is one great way to gain experience in order to become a MOTU.

* Drbd: ivoks reported that he had been working on a new package for Ubuntu that used dkms. The package is currently available from the Ubuntu HA PPA and is waiting to be pushed in Karmic. The Debian maintainers have also shown interest in using a DKMS-enabled package.

* Cluster stack: Ro``Ak``So``Ax and ivoks worked on updating the cluster stack in the ubuntu-ha team. pacemaker, openais and corosync have been fixed and some of them are available from the Ubuntu HA PPA.

* Php 5.3: zul and ajmitch have been looking at getting php 5.3 in karmic. 5.3 has been uploaded to experimental to get more testing there. The big difference with the current version in karmic (5.2) is that the suhosin patch has not been ported to 5.3 yet. The security team doesn’t feel comfortable with shipping php without the suhosin patch enabled.

It was decided to push 5.3 into a PPA to get wider testing from the Ubuntu community. Once the suhosin patch is ported to 5.3 and enabled in the build 5.3 can be uploaded to karmic.

An ubuntu-php-team should also be created to handle the maintenance of the php PPA. There have also been some requests for backported versions of php. A PPA and -backports are options to handle this use case.

* Agree on next meeting date and time: Next meeting will be on Tuesday, July 14th at 15:00 UTC in #ubuntu-meeting.
