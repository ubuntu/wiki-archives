=== Introduction ===

This BoF is for the discussion of the potential replacement of Package Framework with other, potentially superior options.

=== Rationale ===

Package Framework is one of Tom's NIH projects. This particular one was a replacement for autoconf. The project is not yet complete and has since effectively been abandoned. As such, Bazaar needs to migrate to a build system that is more portable, more accepted and more useful.

=== Scope and Use Cases ===

=== Implementation Plan ===

==== Data Preservation and Migration ====

==== Packages Affected ====

==== User Interface Requirements ====

=== Outstanding Issues ===

==== UDU BOF Agenda ====

==== UDU Pre-Work ====
