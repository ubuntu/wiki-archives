== Feature Definitions ==

Feature definitions are where we define what changes we want for Ubuntu Studio. After FeatureDefinitionFreeze we follow the established feature definitions as a guide when we implement the changes. In some cases, the feature definition is transformed into blueprints.

=== Adding Feature Definitions ===

To make it easy to find feature definition pages, create the page as a sub page to this page.

=== List of all Feature Definitions ===

Listed below are all sub pages to <nowiki>[[UbuntuStudio-FeatureDefinitions]]</nowiki>.
