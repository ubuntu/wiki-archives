=== LoCo News ===

==== The State of the LoCo ====

Benjamin Kerensa writes about the status of Lo``Co teams in the United States. He shares "troubling" quotes from some unapproved teams he contacted to learn what has prevented them from becoming approved teams. In order to address the issues brought up, he suggests: improved mentoring, better engagement with unapproved Lo``Cos, follow-ups and health checks of Lo``Cos who are declined approval, and a library of resources that include a leadership document.

Bacon states: “Prentice Hall is happy to send each and every approved Lo``Co team one free copy of The Official Ubuntu Book. To be entirely clear: this is one copy of the book per team. This will be a great addition to each team’s library of Ubuntu books!”

==== Mathieu Trudel: Bug 1010724: Why doesn't dnsmasq listen on both IPv4 and IPv6? ====

Mathieu Trudel writes about dnsmasq in Ubuntu currently only listening on an IPv4 address, stating: “Dnsmasq currently only listens on 127.0.0.1; that's done on purpose. If the only nameserver you have is 127.0.0.1, both IPv4 and IPv6 queries will go through it. It doesn't listen on an IPv6 address.” Trudel goes on to say “Letting dnsmasq listen on IPv6 is definitely something I wouldn't mind to see working; but it's unfortunately not as simple as adding '--listen-address=::1' to the parameters passed to dnsmasq by Network``Manager.”

http://blog.cyphermox.net/2012/08/bug-1010724-why-doesnt-dnsmasq-listen.html

==== Jorge Castro: Easier Installation for Everyone With the Ubuntu Button ====

Jorge Castro writes in his blog about the Ubuntu Button, stating “we have a bunch of places where we could use this button, and it’d be easy for people to submit edits and make each answer better and better. When someone google’s “How do I install foo on Ubuntu?” it’d be nice to see that big honkin’ button.”

http://www.jorgecastro.org/2012/08/07/easier-installation-for-everyone-with-the-ubuntu-button/

==== Canonical Design Team: Ubuntu Online Tour ====

Anthony Dillon writes about his recent work with the Ubuntu online tour innovations with HTML5 and JQuery.

=== In Other News ===

==== Three Top Ubuntu Alternatives ====

Matt Harley of Datamation explores his “top 3” Ubuntu alternatives. These are derivatives based on Ubuntu, yet having their own unique take on the Ubuntu base. The three derivatives covered are Linux Mint, with its simpler UI, software backup, and desktop environment. Then there's Peppermint Linux OS which, in contrast to Linux Mint, is very cloud-centric in its preferences in cloud software over local apps. Then there's Pear Linux 5, which is very Apple-like in its UI and is ideal for netbooks.

http://www.datamation.com/open-source/three-top-ubuntu-alternatives-1.html

==== Ubuntu 12.10 Might Ship With Nautilus 3.4 Instead Of 3.6 ====

Andrew, Web``Upd8, reports on recent comments from Sebastien Bacher, software engineer at Canonical, that Ubuntu 12.10 Quantal Quetzal might go back to Nautilus 3.4, even though Nautilus 3.5 is already in Quantal repositories. Furthermore Ubuntu might follow the recent forks from Nautilus, such as Marlin or Nemo.
