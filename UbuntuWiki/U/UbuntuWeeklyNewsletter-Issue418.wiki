==== Ubuntu Advantage Storage launches at OpenStack Summit ====

Caroline Tarbett informs us that at the Open``Stack Summit in Vancouver Canonical has launched software-defined storage solutions with cloud-style pricing.

==== To converge onto mobile, tablet, and desktop, think Grid Units ====

Benjamin Keyser looks at how in the converged world of Unity 8, applications will work on different size screens as if by magic and that to achieve this he says that we should design using grid units. He explains what grid units are, and provides an exercise for those interested to try out.

=== In The Press ===

==== How Walmart uses OpenStack to deliver its 'everyday low prices' ====

Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols writing for ZDNet details how the world’s largest retailer has “bet the house that Open``Stack is ready for prime-time.” He goes on to share details about their deployment, including the use of Ubuntu.

http://www.zdnet.com/article/walmart-relies-on-openstack/

==== The Meizu X4 is the first compelling Ubuntu phone ====

Chris Hoffman of PCWorld writes that Meizu's MX4 is now out in China and that it will be on sale in Europe soon. He looks at its specification, noting that is a higher-end phone than the Bq Aquaris, informs us that it is initially pitched at developers, and asks about phones for the USA and elsewhere. He reminds us that Canonical will be announcing a phone for the US market in June, adding: "Unfortunately, we haven’t heard anything about phones for the rest of the world."

http://www.pcworld.com/article/2923931/the-meizu-x4-is-the-first-compelling-ubuntu-phone.html

==== Mark Shuttleworth: Why Ubuntu mobile really matters ====

Toby Wolpe of ZDNet reports on why Mark Shuttleworth believes Ubuntu mobile really matters. According to Shuttleworth, while there may not be a smartphone that can function as a desktop, the actual pursuit of mobile technology has brought many benefits to Ubuntu.

http://www.zdnet.com/article/mark-shuttleworth-why-ubuntu-mobile-really-matters/

=== In The Blogosphere ===

==== Meizu MX4 Ubuntu Edition Launched in China, Coming to Europe soon ====

Tech Drive-In’s Manuel Jose reports three months since BQ Aquaris E4.5 was revealed the Meizu MX4 with Ubuntu has been launched. While BQ’s device is labeled as a low-end device the MX4 does not cut any corners when it comes to specs.

http://www.techdrivein.com/2015/05/meizu-mx4-ubuntu-edition-launched-in.html

==== Ubuntu Touch to be Officially Based on Ubuntu 15.04 Starting with OTA-4 ====

Marius Nestor writes that Łukasz Zemczak from Canonical's Foundations Team has announced that the next major update to Ubuntu for phones will be dubbed OTA-4 and will officially change its base to the Ubuntu 15.04 release. He says that the update, which is due at the end of May, includes significant new features such as better Bluetooth support, hotspot support, new keyboard layouts, as well as better app startup performance.

==== Will Ubuntu Linux Hit 200 Million Users This Year? ====

Michael Larabel of Phoronix reminds us that it has been four years since Mark Shuttleworth expressed his goal of "200 million users of Ubuntu in four years" and says that while use of Ubuntu has increased it doesn't look like that goal will be realized. He says that when Mark came up with his goal he was probably thinking that there would be far more users of the Ubuntu Phone than there is now. Michael also reminds us of Canonical's claim that Ubuntu would soon ship on 5% of PCs, something which is clearly not the case in the US and Europe.

==== Misplaced ire toward Ubuntu and Canonical is hurting Linux ====

Jack Wallen of Tech``Republic reflects upon the history of how the open source community has treated successful companies like Red Hat throughout the years and compares it to the treatment of Ubuntu and Canonical today. He continues by writing that the Ubuntu brand is the “one distribution best poised for mass acceptance” and calls upon the open source community to get behind the effort rather than continuing to “fight among themselves”.

http://www.techrepublic.com/article/misplaced-ire-toward-ubuntu-and-canonical-is-hurting-linux/

==== Ubuntu 15.10 Release Schedule ====

Joey-Elijah Sneddon of OMG! Ubuntu! writes that Canonical has announced the planned release schedule of Ubuntu 15.10 ‘Wily Werewolf’. Of note is the release date of October 22, 2015 with a the Beta 2 release scheduled for September 24, 2015.

==== Xubuntu 15.04 Vivid Vervet - Fabulous ====

Dedoimedo takes a look at Xubuntu 15.04 which he says has been an excellent performer in recent years. With the aid of screenshots, he looks at running it in a live session, installation, package management and updates,  the applications, smartphone support, and battery life. In his conclusion Dedoimedo says "By far the best distro of this year." and "Try it, you won't be disappointed. We're done here."
