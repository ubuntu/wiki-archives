We will be streamlining the wiki to eliminate redundancy and a hopefully greater effort will be made to create a side-kick library of links pertaining to current development cycles. Also I would like to encourage a greater co-operation with the QATeam for, as it is, a large number of U+1 team members do belong to the QATeam also. Hopefully this outreach will provide a greater connect between both teams and in effect making it more efficient to manage  the wiki and all of it's content while also providing assistance to the QATeam and Ubuntu as a whole.'''<<BR>>'''<<BR>>The U+1 Team is now under new Leadership (<nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ventrical|Ventrical]]</nowiki>). <<BR>><<BR>>''''''<<BR>>The new current testing cycle is code named Wily Werewolf 15.10.<<BR>>
