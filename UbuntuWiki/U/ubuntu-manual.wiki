== Getting Started with Ubuntu ==

''Getting Started with Ubuntu '' is a complete beginner's manual for Ubuntu, featuring comprehensive guides, How Tos, and information on anything you need to know after first installing Ubuntu.

Designed to be as user-friendly and easy to follow as possible, the Ubuntu Manual provides the first point of reference for any Ubuntu newcomer with lots of information in one easy-to-access PDF file. Every six months we produce a new revision of this manual intend to produce a new revision -- a new release to coincide with each new release of Ubuntu.

The manual is written and maintained by the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-manual|Ubuntu Manual Team,]]</nowiki> a group of volunteers striving to improve Ubuntu education by creating quality, up-to-date and consistent learning materials and documentation.

The team has a website where lots of information can be found along with a copy of the manual.
