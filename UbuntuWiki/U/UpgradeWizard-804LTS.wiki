== Step 2/3 - Upgrading Ubuntu 8.04 LTS ==

If you're using Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, '''it is a stable Ubuntu version'''. There is no need to upgrade at this time unless your use of Ubuntu doesn't match the reasons explained below. If you decide to upgrade anyways, you have two choices:
* <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes#From%208.04%20LTS%20to%208.10|Step 3/3: Upgrading Ubuntu 8.04 LTS to 8.10]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LucidUpgrades#Upgrade%20from%208.04%20LTS%20to%2010.04%20LTS%20Beta|Step 3/3: Upgrading Ubuntu 8.04 LTS to the current Ubuntu development version (Lucid Lynx, 10.04 LTS)]]</nowiki>

'''Why should I keep this Ubuntu version ?'''
* Security and major bug updates are available until April 2011 (Desktop) and April 2013 (Server)
* It benefits from full commercial support until April 2011 (Desktop) and April 2013 (Server)
* Any other releases during that period are not obligatory upgrades.
* If you don't need the latest software applications but prefer stable, tested ones, using this Ubuntu version maximizes stability and reliability.
