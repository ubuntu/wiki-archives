The Ubuntu UK Marketing project aims to offer UK specific marketing of the Ubuntu Linux distribution. This isn't a fork of the official marketing group or the ubuntu-uk team - more a drive towards creating a local group specialising in marketing to the UK at both local and national levels. We ask that all of our members join the main Ubuntu marketing group, and its mailing list in addition to this group. Together we are stronger.

We have a launchpad team page over at https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-uk-marketing If you'd like to be kept up to date on project development then please sign up.

Ubuntu-UK Marketing utilises the Ubuntu-UK <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UKTeam/IRC|IRC Channel]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-uk|mailing list]]</nowiki> When sending a message to the list however we would suggest prefixing your message with [UK Marketing] to differentiate it from other traffic.
