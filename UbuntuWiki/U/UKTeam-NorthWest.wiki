This page should list LUGs, Ubuntu user groups or anyone else interested in Ubuntu that is in the North West of the UK. If you have any Ubuntu-related events planned then please add them here to hopefully get more people involved, and if you have any Free Software/Open Source or related projects then please post links to sites giving more information so that Ubuntu users can add to and improve the project, in true Open Source fashion!
