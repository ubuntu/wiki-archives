=== What is Moblin ===
Moblin is a major initiative launched by Intel targeting the netbook
market. Intel is the upstream and has developed some very appealing code
for Moblin and it has gathered lots of momentum in the market.
Moblin is not a distribution itself (but does have a reference implementation based on Fedora), but instead relies on OSV's (like
Canonical and others) to support, package and ship Moblin on their
distributions. So Canonical decided to release a version of Moblin
running on Ubuntu (Ubuntu Moblin Remix) such that we could
give users the freedom to try out Moblin on our great platform that
they know and love 

=== What is Ubuntu Moblin Remix ===
* Moblin 2.1 preview release running on Ubuntu 9.10
* Developer focused, as based on an "preview" (i.e. not final) version of Moblin
* Moblin's rpms were converted to debian packages
* Some packages in made it to "universe" for Karmic, others in PPA https://edge.launchpad.net/~moblin/+archive/ppa
* Ubuntu Moblin Remix image available for download here: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-moblin-remix/releases/karmic/release/ubuntu-moblin-remix-9.10-moblin-remix-i386.iso
* Bug tracking: https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu-moblin-remix

=== How are Ubuntu Moblin Remix and Ubuntu Netbook Remix different? ===
Ubuntu Netbook Remix was developed by Canonical well before Moblin. Canonical continues to develop
and support UNR going forward. We are testing and supporting many
hardware models out of the box with UNR and will continue
to develop UNR past Karmic. UNR is quite popular, intuitive and well
integrated in our platform. 
* UNR is well integrated with the Ubuntu platform (gnome, Ubuntu One, notifications, etc..)
* UNR user interface is straight forward, simple to use
* UNR has been shipping commercially for over 1 year, it's well tested and proven

=== What vendors are shipping Ubuntu Moblin? ===
* Dell Mini 10v, 9.04 based Moblin
* Available for download here: http://en.community.dell.com/wikis/linux/ubuntu-9-04-moblin-remix-developer-edition.aspx
