==== Nicholas Skaggs: Reflections ====

Nicholas Skaggs reflects upon the work he’s done in Quality Assurance over the past couple years, and thanks folks who have been involved, writing: “Oftentimes quality can be a background job, with thank you's going unsaid, while complaints are easy to find. Truly, it's been wonderful learning and hacking on quality efforts with you. So thank you!”

==== Julian Andres Klode: Dropping SHA-1 support in APT ====

Julian Andres Klode discusses the move to disable SHA1 support for future releases, packages and source files, writing that “disabling the SHA1 support requires a bit of patching in our test suite, it’s best to do that now than later when we’re forced to do it.” He continues by sketching out a timeline for completion of this switch, including enforcement of SHA2 for GPG signatures.

https://juliank.wordpress.com/2016/03/14/dropping-sha-1-support-in-apt/

==== Yet Another Reason Why Ubuntu MATE 16.04 Will Rock ====

Joey-Elijah Sneddon of OMG! Ubuntu! highlights some interesting changes relating to GTK in Ubuntu MATE that will land in Ubuntu MATE 16.04 LTS, set to release in late April, from Martin Wimpress’ recent Google+ post. He says, “Ubuntu MATE 16.04 will offer full support for Client Side Decoration (CSD) and GTK Header Bar applications out of the box.” He goes on to point out a screenshot and some applications that could use this, “Header bars span a range of apps, from the increasingly useful GNOME Photos to the geek-friendly Polari IRC client and by way of the fantastic Corebird desktop Twitter app.”

==== NVIDIA GeForce vs. Radeon/AMDGPU OpenGL Performance On Ubuntu 16.04 ====

Michael Larabel of Phoronix writes an article summarizing performance, comparing NVIDIA and AMD OpenGL drivers on Ubuntu Xenial Xerus, the development branch that is set to release in late April. He shows us some statistics using various graphics cards and drivers, for NVIDIA and AMD. He summarizes the results with: “So while it's exciting that the open-source Radeon Linux driver stack is maturing and becoming much more competitive with Catalyst, the whole AMD Linux driver stack with regard to OpenGL performance still needs to be improved. In several of these tests, all of the tested AMD hardware was slower than all of the NVIDIA Ge``Force hardware.”
