These sessions were used to discuss, design, and plan the Ubuntu 12.04 LTS edition that will be released in April 2012. This post provides a summary of many of the outcomes and decisions finalized at the event.”

He points out highlights from the following areas:

* The Keynote
* Desktop
* Server and Cloud
* Foundations
* Hardware
* Community
* Design
* Security
* ARM
* Other

Bacon gives links to the UDS blueprints. Read Bacon’s full post to see the summary of all these areas and see where you can participate to help make the next release of Ubuntu a success.

==== Ubuntu 12.04 Development update ====

Five weeks after UDS,  Daniel Holbach posts another Ubuntu development update in this continuing series.

Holbach writes, “To get a good high-level idea of what was agreed on across the board, check out the proceedings of UDS. It contains the key take-aways from all of the different tracks at UDS: Desktop, Server and Cloud, Foundations, Hardware, Community, Design, ARM and others.

Some major updates like Perl 5.14 and Linux 3.1 (3.2 is expected in the final 12.04 release) have landed and a huge chunk of packages have been merged from Debian already. You can still get involved there.

Until next week all blueprints have to be done and specifications been written, on 24th November we will have Feature Definition Freeze. The week afterwards (1st December), we hope to get Alpha 1 out the door.”

He also discusses Desktop-y bits in progress, Ubuntu Community Appreciation Day, 20 Ubuntu Weekly Development Updates, Get Involved, Find something to work on, and Getting in touch.

In this article, Eric Hammond will “walk through the steps to create an Auto Scaling configuration that runs an instance on a recurring schedule (e.g., four times a day) starting up a pre-defined task and letting that instance shut itself down when it is finished. We tweak the Auto Scaling group so that this uses the minumum cost in instance run time, even though we may not be able to predict in advance exactly how long it will take to complete the job.”

Hammond starts with a high level overview then discusses the Prerequisites, User-data Script, Auto Scaling Group, Clean up, Timing, and Notes.
