==== Thank you [Community Council] ====

Mark Shuttleworth writes a short post thanking the Ubuntu Community Council for their proactive interest in keeping the community happy. He concludes: “They say that it’s tough at the top because the easy problems don’t get escalated, and that is particularly true of the CC. So far, they are doing us proud.”

==== Meizu Pro 5 Ubuntu Edition Smartphone Review (and Giveaway) ====

Christian Cawley of Make Use Of does an extensive review of the Meizu Pro 5 Ubuntu Edition, which includes videos, a photo comparison and more. He concludes, “the Meizu Pro 5 Ubuntu Edition is a solid piece of hardware that should appeal to any Ubuntu desktop user and smartphone owners disillusioned with the way things are going with iOS and Android. If Convergence can be brought into the mix on this device, and app stability issues addressed, the Meizu Pro 5 Ubuntu Edition could prove an attractive alternative to the marketplace-focused worlds of iOS and Android.”

In closing, he writes: “From my perspective, it's an outstanding first entry that has been long overdue. This is a piece of hardware the Linux community should be proud of and should fully embrace.”

==== Snap – I’ve got the package! ====

Dedoimedo, writing for OCS-Mag gives a quick introduction into Snap packages, including why they’re important to the Ubuntu ecosystems and examples of installing packages. He concludes that the “concept of Snap packages sounds interesting, practical, useful, and beneficial, both to the Ubuntu ecosystem and the future proliferation of the Ubuntu operating system outside the desktop space” but he has concerns about the maturity of the current framework, writing that it’s “still very buggy, it’s not streamlined enough, and it does not provide any great advantage over Firefox OS or Android.”
