=== Introduction ===
One of the greater difficulties that a user can have using a GNU/Linux system for the first time is the "mount-thing", and the way that filesystems are managed. There isn't any GUI to make it easier, so the aim of this project is to finish with this lack offering a GTK aplication that can help in the configuration of fstab and hotplugging system.

It is part of CommandLineDisintegration and can be related with GraphicalConfigTools

=== Rationale ===
To make easier the Storage Devices configuration for new users.

=== Scope and Use Cases ===
* Management of fstab file
** Partition autodetection
** Recommended/default configuration for new devices
** Filesystem-dependent options
** "Transparent" mounting
** Automatized creation of mountpoint directory with the name that user wants to see in his/her desktop
** auto/noauto, user and related options management
* Hotpluging
** udev rules management
** device naming
*** Select name for a usb device to be easily recognised by the user
** permission assignment
*** Specify group allowed to use a device

=== Implementation Plan ===
* fstab scripts management
* Autodetection of supported filesystems (/proc/filesystems) and partition status (/proc/partitions, fstab, mtab...)
* PyGTK interface
* udev scripts management
* PyGTK interface completion

==== Data Preservation and Migration ====
* Modified files backup

==== Packages Affected ====
* It depends on:
** libblkid
** pygtk
==== User Interface Requirements ====
* Access from System Configuration menu
