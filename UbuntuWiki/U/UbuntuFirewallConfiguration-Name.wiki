== Project name for Ubuntu Firewall Configuration ==

I am searching for a good name for my Summer of Code 2007 project, the Ubuntu Firewall Configuration.

You can get more information about this project in the following mailing list announcement:

https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-soc/2007-April/000022.html

I hope to get lots of suggestions from the Ubuntu community and I am sure that all of you will have great ideas.

Please add your suggestions and name to the list below.

The deadline is Tuesday May 8th at noon UTC.

Thanks in advance to all of you!
