==== Ubuntu Developer Week ====

It was a very exciting Ubuntu Developer Week. There were lots and lots of attendees and it was surprising how many really great questions there were, and how awesome the atmosphere was. Everybody was really thrilled about getting started with Ubuntu Development.

It all started off with a two hour session called "Getting Started." For the first time there were sessions in English, Finnish, French, German, Italian and Spanish, and it was a roaring success. Day one also included Packaging 101, Working with Debian, and Understanding Gnome technologies.

Day Two was another jam packed day of sessions and answers that included Launchpad Bug Tracking, QA Tools, Launchpad Web Service API, High-quality Updates. One session that had to be cancelled on day two was Martin Pitt's talk on Debugging Program Crashes due to a misplaced keystroke that deleted his presentation. Look for a rescheduling of his talk here: http://martinpitt.wordpress.com/

With the community primed after two days of sessions, Day Three didn't fail to grab everyones attention. Talks on: Pushing out Gnome releases, Fixing Bugs in Ubuntu, Bazaar for Packaging, Kubuntu Bug Squishing, and Using VMBuilder to create test environments made the day a rousing success for all who attended.

After three solid days of exceptional sessions you'd think the Ubuntu Developers would be running out of topics for discussion, but think again, developing a first class distro like Ubuntu takes endless work. Day Four included topics covering: Automated Desktop Testing, Ubuntu Netbook Remix Q&A, Boot Performance, Kubuntu Ninjas in Unicorn mode, and Packaging software for Mono.

The sessions ended up on Friday, but Day 5 was anything but dull. Talks included the following titles: Testing your .deb with piuparts, Fun with python-apt, Bazaar and Launchpad - How to do it, packaging Kernel modules with DKMS, and Xubuntu.

If you missed any of the sessions, or just want a refresher, you can visit the link and click on any title to follow along with the log of the session. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDeveloperWeek

Ubuntu Developer Week was a huge success. Thanks to all the developers for their hard work putting on this great event, and to the Ubuntu Community for their enthusiastic participation.

https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-classroom/2009-January/000139.html

==== Developer application process changes ====

Here's how future applications will be handled for:

* Ubuntu Contributing Developers
* Ubuntu Developers (MOTU)
* Ubuntu Core Developers (core-dev)

1. Set up a personal wiki page for your application. Please make use of https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopment/DeveloperApplicationTemplate. (Talk to your sponsors beforehand and ask them to add some information to the wiki page. In a regular application your will have 3-5 sponsors.)

2. Add your application details to MOTU/Council/Meeting, give the motu-council list a quick heads-up and pick a meeting time you'll be able to attend. Please allow at least one week of time for the MOTU Council members to review your application. (If you can't make it to one of the meetings, please email motu-council at lists.ubuntu.com for either a different meeting time or to process the application on the mailing list.)

3. Attend the meeting.

The MOTU Council will have prepared for the meeting (reviewed the application details, checked a few examples of your work, talked to sponsors, etc.) and ask questions to make sure the applicant qualifies for the team. During the meeting the MC members will cast their votes and if quorum is reached (3 of 5 currently), will add the applicant to the team (in case of Contributing Developer and MOTU, or speak out a recommendation for the Technical Board) or ask to re-apply in due time.

They have just updated https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopers with the new process, added MOTU Council meeting pages, and the new template for applications. If there's still anything that needs clarification, please let them know. Also the MOTU Council will make sure to have the current applications sorted out until the first meeting.

=== In The Press ===

* Move over GNOME, Ubuntu Mobile looks at Qt, other desktop environments - Rodney Gedda of Computerworld tells us that the Ubuntu Mobile operating system is undergoing its most radical change with a port to the ARM processor for Internet devices and netbooks, and may use Nokia's LGPL Qt development environment as an alternative to GNOME. During a presentation at this year's linux.conf.au conference in Hobart, Canonical's David Mandala said Ubuntu Mobile has changed a lot over the past year in that it now includes netbook devices in addition to MIDs and the ARM port. Mandala said that one of the biggest challenges is reminding developers to write applications for 800 by 600 screen resolutions found in smaller devices. Ubuntu Mobile uses the GNOME Mobile (Hildon framework) instead of a full GNOME desktop, but since Nokia open sourced Qt under the LGPL it may consider this as an alternative. Ubuntu Mobile for netbooks will also get its own distribution in line with the release of Jaunty Jackalope in April 2009.  According to Mandala, Jaunty will have a full image for netbook devices, and Jaunty netbook edition will have a cut-down set of applications as compared with the Ubuntu desktop, but apt-get works and you can install what you like. Mandala says he's working very hard with system vendors to get these devices to market at reasonable prices. http://www.computerworld.com.au/article/273605/move_over_gnome_ubuntu_mobile_looks_qt_other_desktop_environments

* Ubuntu 9.04's blazing boot times - According to IT Wire's David M Williams, the results of the latest alpha release of Ubuntu's Jaunty Jackalope are spectacular. The next major release of Ubuntu will be out this April and Ubuntu’s engineers have, as always, included the latest Linux kernel to come out of Linus Torvalds’ hands. While the kernel always includes more drivers, better performance and various bug fixes, often times these go under the radar because they are obscure, or only of niche interest. The Linux kernel 2.6.28 delivers a stable implementation of the ext4 file system. It’s this file system which is getting geeks worldwide all steamy under the collar. ext4 looks set to offer greater file performance along with greater reliability and stability. What’s more, while ext3 was designed well before the advent of SSDs, ext4 is fully aware of such drives. ext4 includes the ability to maximize the lifetime of solid state drives and thus should theoretically offer a boost to netbooks without any corresponding fear of a shortened lifetime. Here's to Ubuntu 9.04 and better disk speed! http://www.itwire.com/content/view/22671/1141/

* Don't Fear the Penguin: A Newbie's Guide to Linux - Neil Mc``Allister of PC World says that getting started with Linux can be an intimidating task, particularly for people who have never tried any operating system besides Windows. In truth, however, very little about Linux is actually difficult to use. It's little wonder why Ubuntu is one of the leading Linux distributions for desktop PCs - it makes installing Linux simple. But once you have Ubuntu installed on your PC, what next? The short answer is: Whatever you like. Ubuntu may be free, but it's hardly a toy OS. If you can do something with Windows or Mac OS X, you can do the same thing with Ubuntu. The great thing about Linux distributions such as Ubuntu is that they include not only the OS but also a whole bundle of practical, full-featured applications. If you're having difficulty, your best option for further assistance is the Ubuntu forums, where beginners and advanced users gather to troubleshoot their favorite OS. Above all, have a good time. Linux's greatest strength is the community around it, and by choosing Ubuntu you have joined a thriving, growing community of users of one of the most powerful and exciting operating systems available today. http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/158059-1/dont_fear_the_penguin_a_newbies_guide_to_linux.html

=== In The Blogosphere ===

* French Lawmakers Hope to Inspire Linux Revolution - Blogger Ashlee Vance tells us that about 18 months ago, the French National Assembly shifted from running Windows on the 1,100 computers of its members and their assistants, to running a version of Linux called Ubuntu. They are doing this not only for financial reasons, but for political reasons. They expect to save about 500,000 euros, or 648,750 dollars over the next 5 years. They also hope to create more local jobs by giving local companies the chance to offer services to install and manage Linux for businesses. A survey polling members of the French Assembly found that 80 percent of the members were happy with the new software, which included new e-mail and office applications, while only 14 percent felt Windows should return. http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/21/french-lawmakers-hope-to-inspire-linux-revolution/

* Tech``Crunch Tablet Update: Prototype B - Blogger Michael Arrington of Tech``Crunch goes over their prototype of a small and cheap tablet for web surfing. Their goal was to make it so that it would cost around $200, but he goes on to say that $299 is a more realistic price. It has a 12-inch touchscreen with a 1024x768 resolution, which will make it easy to view full webpages without scrolling. It's powered by a Via Nano processor, with 1 GB of ram and a 4 GB flashdrive to store the OS and browser. Other features include: wifi, an accelerometer, camera and a 4 cell battery. For the OS they are using Ubuntu with a custom browser, drivers and a virtual keyboard. The software was created by Fusion Garage. So far they have not decided whether they will start making production units. http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/01/19/techcrunch-tablet-update-prototype-b/

* Ubuntu's Shuttleworth praises Windows 7, welcomes fight - Blogger Gavin Clarke reports on Mark Shuttleworth's reaction to Windows 7. Shuttleworth states he is looking forward to a good, clean netbook fight with Microsoft following the release of Windows 7. He believes that with Microsoft having to sell Windows 7 to OEMs instead of giving Windows XP away to them, it will improve Ubuntu's place in the market. Shuttleworth thinks that a good version of Windows will end the current phony war between Windows and Linux in the high-growth netbook market, and reignite the fight on features and capabilities. Even with the new features that Windows 7 is coming out with, the plans for Ubuntu 9.04 Jaunty Jackalope, will up it's game to keep pace. http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/01/22/shuttleworth_windows_7/

* Woman Quits College, Blames Ubuntu, Is Flamed by Overzealous Fanboys - Katherine Noyes of Linux``Insider's Linux Blog Safari tells us of how some members of the Linux community relentlessly flamed a woman who dropped out of college after finding her laptop, which was running Ubuntu, didn't work as expected. Others came to her defense, but not before she was dismissed as "stupid" and "ignorant." The result? Nothing short of mayhem. The Linux community can get upset when those on the Windows side of the fence complain about smaller things they view as deficiencies in our favorite operating system, but when someone says it's so bad they had to drop out of college, you can just imagine the situation in the blogosphere. More than 3,000 Diggs and 1,000 comments greeted the original story within a day of its posting on Digg on Thursday, not to mention more than 1,500 comments on Slashdot. WKOW posted a follow-up to report on the overwhelming -- and overwhelmingly negative -- response both the station and the young woman in question had received. Unfortunately, Linux and Ubuntu get the ding here, but neither deserves it. http://www.linuxinsider.com/rsstory/65877.html

* HP Mini 1000 now with Ubuntu 8.10! - HP now has the right idea. Ubuntu is (there is debate) the leading open soure OS out there in the world at the moment. HP is making a Mini computer that is suppose to be cheaper and faster so that you could do the daily tasks that you need to without bringing along your Desktop Computer, or a large laptop. This makes perfect sense because Ubuntu can run on very little specs, and would be better then Windows any day. This netbook is equipped with an Intel Atom N270 (1.6GHz) processor, with 512MB of DDR2 RAM, and 8GB SSD drive. http://www.shopping.hp.com/webapp/shopping/series_can.do?storeName=computer_store&landing=notebooks&a1=Category&v1=Mini Prices start out at $330 which is really affordable and is a great decision by HP and Canonical! http://www.ubuntuforyou.com/node/16

* Ubuntu Mobile Internet Devices (MIDs): Still Coming Soon? - With Canonical announcing plans to develop Mobile Internet devices in mid 2007, author Panettieri expected to be testing or buying an Ubuntu MID sometime in 2008. As we enter 2009, the MID effort doesn't seem to be paying dividends for Canonical yet. Panettieri asked Canonical Marketing Manager Gerr Carr for an update on the MID and was told that while they continue to maintain and improve the version for MIDs, Netbooks is in a different category and requires more customization, causing it to be slower to get into the market. However with Moblin 2.0 adding to the number of available applications, many more MID success stories should be in store for Ubuntu in 2009. http://www.workswithu.com/2009/01/20/ubuntu-mobile-internet-devices-mids-still-coming-soon/
