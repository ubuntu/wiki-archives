=== Who am I? ===
UseResa is a concatenation of User Resa (my first name) and for some reason, don't even know why, I decided to drop the double R in the middle.<<BR>>
<<BR>>
My full name is Resa Drijsen, born on the 21^st^ of August, 1962.<<BR>>
I am happily married and have two children a boy (born 1991) and a girl (born 1994), so what else is there to wish for?<<BR>>
If you would like to learn more about me or my interests, visit my <nowiki>[[http://resalxh.wordpress.com/ | Wordpress Blog]]</nowiki>.<<BR>>
<<BR>>
I have a degree in Automotive Engineering and have worked in the automotive industry from 1987 'till 1997.<<BR>>
During my last job in the automotive industry I came in touch with <nowiki>[[http://www.sas.com | SAS Software]]</nowiki>.<<BR>>
I have always had an interest in the ICT and in 1997 I got the opportunity as a consultant for SAS Netherlands.<<BR>>
In the period that I worked for SAS ('till 2000) and the years after I focussed on data warehousing and Business Intelligence.<<BR>>
And - although not longer working for SAS - that is what I am still today, a (senior) SAS Consultant.<<BR>>

=== LINUX & Ubuntu ===
Believing that a person is never to old to learn I have started learning and using Linux in the summer of 2006.<<BR>>
So I think it is save to say I am a newb in the world of Linux ;-)<<BR>>
My first introduction to Linux was by installing '''Ubuntu 6.06''' ''Dapper Drake''.<<BR>>
Having some Unix experience I found Ubuntu easy-to-use and I have picked up quite a bit (if I may say so myself).<<BR>>
<<BR>>
Today (October 2006) I have tried several other distro's in VM and still in the progress of finding my way.<<BR>>
Still learning more everyday and hoping that I will be able to continue learning in the years to come.<<BR>>
