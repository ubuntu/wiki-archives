__TOC__

LionelDricot suggests the creation of the Ubuntu-be loco team.

* The front page informs about what Ubuntu is and what Ubuntu-be is
* There must be three main contacts for the three languages. Contacts must be able to answer questions, interview and the rest.
* Event team. People that are ready to participate in an event (or organisate one) in order to promote Ubuntu. A mailing list can be set.
* Support list. I suggest to have a list of adress with :
** LUG that are ready to help about Ubuntu and to borrow/give Ubuntu CDs
** Vendors that are Ubuntu friendly
* help forums must be linked to ubuntu-fr, ubuntu-nl and ubuntu-de. No need to duplicate efforts here.
* is there a need for a local forum ?

 Hosting : LionelDricot has maybe a solution for hosting (depending on the needed bandwidth)
