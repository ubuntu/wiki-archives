==== Photowalk ====

** Something different, a photo walking tour of San Fran. It doesn't matter what level of photography you are into, bring your camera and we're going to walk and take photos. Map of the route we're taking to be worked out but will end up with dinner along the way. If you're interested sign up.

We're going to meet at 6:30 in the lobby at the reception and head towards Chinatown, that way we can take photos and grab something to eat, remember to have your clipper card for the BART and cash for dinner on you.
