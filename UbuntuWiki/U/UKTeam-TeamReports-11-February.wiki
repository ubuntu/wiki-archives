__TOC__

* We exhibited at the Cloud Expo/Open Source expo, handed out 50 or so CDs, the show was rather quiet, but we did introduce quite a few people to Ubuntu who had little prior exposure to Free Software
* Some of the team attended the launch of the Shape My Language exhibition at the Design Museum which is a display of the font art of Dalton Maag, particularly in celebration of the new Ubuntu font.
