15:07:36 <Hellow>	# Cheesy meeting beginning:
15:07:38 <Hellow>	#BEGIN MEETING
15:07:58 <Hellow>	Alright, thank you that are attending for attending this meeting :)
15:08:02 *	zvacet (n=ivica_ko@78.1.24.51) has joined #ubuntuforums-unanswered
15:08:09 <Hellow>	Our meeting agenda can be found here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UnansweredPostsTeam/Meetings
15:08:33 <Hellow>	Our first order of business is: Future of the team
15:08:52 <Hellow>	I have been needing to discuss this with the active portion of the team for a long time.
15:09:11 <Hellow>	There has been talks about merging with the BT, but that never happened (primarily because the team was split even half)
15:09:33 <Hellow>	So, I would like to ask: Where do *you* want to see the team going?
15:09:43 <komputes>	a while back bodhi came in talking about merging with BT, i see no problem with that.
15:10:03 <Hellow>	komputes: Yes, he was the primary person behind that :P
15:10:58 <Hellow>	I personally think we should stay separate: Both teams cover different areas, although we do overlap different times.
15:11:16 <talsemgeest>	Hellow: Completely agree with you there
15:11:53 <Hellow>	Anyone want to add their input to that?
15:11:56 <starcraftman>	Well I was liking idea of merging with bt, would make organizing easier and getting new members (since we'd be an fg, and bt is much larger). Probably reduce management on ya Hellow, as well since part of a larger group.
15:12:03 <komputes>	the way I see it, we deal with what BT can't/doesn't answer, there's nothing stoping us from commenting on newer posts as well
15:12:30 <starcraftman>	Maybe I'm a bit biased, I am a bt member :/
15:12:39 <Hellow>	starcraftman: You forget, so am I :P.
15:12:53 <starcraftman>	lol, this is so. Can be biased other way I suppse.
15:13:13 <drubin>	personally I don't think this team is as active any more as it used to be...
15:13:23 <drubin>	but that doesn't stop it from becoming active
15:13:24 <drubin>	:
15:13:26 <drubin>	:)
15:13:47 <drubin>	but I have been very inactive over the last few weeks so not sure that is a valid point
15:13:56 <komputes>	I agree with drubin, as well BT seems to have better structure
15:14:10 <starcraftman>	IMO, if we merge into bt, then tracker can be used by many more people quickly and bottom line is getting people good quality information who had 0 posts. Also, there's a lot of knolwedgeable poeple on BT smarter than me. I can admit that.
15:14:11 <drubin>	BT has had a stable leader.
15:14:13 <talsemgeest>	drubin: TBH since I became a member I have never seen the team as ver active. I seem to remember one of the first things bodhi said was to come to the BT channel, because this one is normally dead'
15:14:22 <drubin>	with aj busy with uni stuff.. it has been hard
15:14:26 <Hellow>	drubin: And the UA has a *new* leader :P
15:14:50 <drubin>	i know that
15:15:15 <Hellow>	talsemgeest: And i'm working to fix/change that :).
15:15:37 <talsemgeest>	Hellow: Yup, and I am very happy about that :)
15:15:39 <Hellow>	Although it's been hard with me sick for 4 days and PT being gone doing... i've forgotten.
15:16:14 <starcraftman>	I was kinda imaging some easy way to register already long standing bt members with UA tracker. Maybe wishful thinking, anyway, thats my paragraph of text worth of idea.
15:16:14 <komputes>	Hellow: do you have access/willingness to improve the ua.codechunk.net tracker?
15:16:38 <Hellow>	komputes: No, either ajmorris or jacob handles that.
15:16:46 <Hellow>	komputes: Although I do have *willingness*
15:17:05 <Hellow>	Anyway, if no one has anything more to add to our current topic, lets move on.
15:17:30 <komputes>	I've always seen the tracket as having potential, but it was never useful as it stands.
15:17:32 <starcraftman>	Nobody replies to starcraftman's paragraphs.
15:17:35 <starcraftman>	humph!
15:17:48 <Hellow>	Next topic: Activity within Ubuntu
15:18:09 <Hellow>	Our team does have a place within the Ubuntu community, a very big one too.
15:18:20 <Hellow>	One that is much more general than the BT's (lol)
15:18:39 <talsemgeest>	Hellow: I both agree and disagree with that one
15:18:42 <Hellow>	Answering unanswered posts helps hold members to the Ubuntu community
15:18:52 *	starcraftman goes gets drink of water.
15:19:06 <Hellow>	And it helps them feel welcomed with us :)
15:19:33 <komputes>	Mostly helps them feel that the problem they face is not being ignored
15:19:40 <talsemgeest>	I believe it has a smaller part than the BT because it is basically just the forums, whereas the BT has grown outside of the forums
15:19:58 <talsemgeest>	However, I agree our breadth of knowledge is greater than the BTs
15:20:12 <komputes>	talsemgeest: to answers.launchpad.net or mailing list or both?
15:20:37 <Hellow>	That was what I was about to talk about.
15:20:52 <Hellow>	I think we should expand outside of the forums, to encompass what komputes said :)
15:21:06 <talsemgeest>	komputes: Good point, but it is still a narrow approach. However, I think it is that narrow approach we need to succede
15:21:25 <Hellow>	We can nearly double our effectiveness within the community by expanding to Launchpad answers.
15:21:36 <komputes>	talsemgeest: can you explain how BT has expanded ouside of ubuntuforums.org?
15:21:42 <talsemgeest>	Hellow: Very much agreed
15:22:30 <talsemgeest>	komputes: Namely the FGs, in programming, in Wikis/documentation, support, and general beginner education
15:22:43 <Hellow>	If people post their problem to Launchpad Answers and get no reply, they get the same feeling as they would on the forums: That nobody cares about their problem.
15:23:00 <komputes>	Hellow: that happens very often
15:23:42 <Hellow>	Then we should focus upon both expanding our involvement in the forums and our involvement on Launchpad Answers.
15:24:15 <Hellow>	Does anyone have anything to add before I move on?
15:24:45 <starcraftman>	Ummm, shouldn't we have more members before expanding. Just a thought.
15:24:53 <Hellow>	That's a part of expanding :)
15:25:51 <Hellow>	Anyone else have anything to add/ask?
15:26:27 <Hellow>	Alrighty
15:26:36 <Hellow>	Next Topic: Team Communication
15:26:52 <Hellow>	This involves both communication within the team and outside the team, with other teams in the community.
15:27:13 <Hellow>	A lack of communication is what is possibly causing this team to not be as active as it could be.
15:27:34 <Hellow>	Not everyone is subscribed to the mailing list, and not everyone comes into IRC.
15:27:51 <Hellow>	I think that we should all follow and encourage those two with other members.
15:28:59 <Hellow>	Anything to add anyone?
15:29:06 <Hellow>	*crickets*
15:29:10 <Hellow>	:P
15:29:27 <starcraftman>	Nope, sounds fine. I usually am around if people need to talk to me though, at least once a day.
15:30:11 <talsemgeest>	All sounds good to me :)
15:30:16 <Hellow>	Later on I think we should have an "official correspondent" for other teams if one of the three leaders are not around at the time.
15:30:38 <Hellow>	But, that isnt really for a team in this state. Yet. :P
15:30:50 <Hellow>	Anything else to add?
15:31:10 <Hellow>	If not, then I will move on to the fun part of this meeting: New Member Elections
15:31:41 <Hellow>	Alrighty
15:31:47 <Hellow>	First up is starcraftman
15:31:58 <talsemgeest>	Yay :)
15:31:58 <Hellow>	starcraftman, you have the spotlight if you would wish to say anything :)
15:32:29 <starcraftman>	Uh, well, my wiki listing my work over the while > https://wiki.ubuntu.com/starcraft.man/
15:33:13 <Hellow>	Anyone wish to say anything about that?
15:33:15 <starcraftman>	Been doing a lot of doc work lately for backup, almost done I suppose, will be getting back into more regular posting on forums.
15:33:58 <starcraftman>	Done over 2700 posts on forums, answered a lot of 0s. Not one for big speaches.
15:34:14 <Hellow>	You sound like the type of person we need :)
15:34:45 <Hellow>	Anything else?
15:35:40 <starcraftman>	Not really. Most stuff about me on my wiki page for folks to read.
15:35:48 <Hellow>	Alrighty, time for the Officially Unprofessional Voting.
15:35:56 <Hellow>	(I need to get some form of bot in here for this)
15:36:17 <Hellow>	All members have the right to vote, Yay or Nay, all mutes will be counted as abstained :)
15:36:48 <talsemgeest>	A big +1 for starcraftman
15:36:51 <Hellow>	talsemgeest, Rocket2DMn, komputes, drubin

15:38:12 <Hellow>	Ha :P

15:42:03 <Hellow>	Also, we are getting slammed with rain, so do not worry if I suddenly disconnect for some reason.
15:42:13 <zvacet>	not much I like to answer questions to get some info and that new members of forum don�t feel ignored
15:42:27 <Hellow>	Also sounds like the type of person we need :)
15:42:36 <Hellow>	Anyone have anything to add?
