==== Daniel Holbach: Making Ubuntu development more personal ====

By looking into ways to make the Ubuntu Development process more personal Daniel Hlobach discusses some observations and suggestions for improvement.
The observations about development in Ubuntu which Holbach lists include: working hard on improving documentation, working on improving the tools, somebody is always around to answer questions, getting better at doing code reviews and providing feedback.

However, even with all this hard work and improvements it was noted that even more needed to be done.  A Developer Advisory Team was created to reach out to:  new contributors and thank them for their work as well as get their feedback; individuals who might be ready to apply for upload rights and help them through that process; formerly active contributors who are now inactive, get their feedback and offer help.

For those who want more information on this process or want to get involved Holbach gives the contact information in the full post.
