==== Ubuntu Desktop Team Indaba - August 26, 2022 17:00 UTC ====

Heather Hellsworth reminds us what the Indaba is, and tells us the next one will be held on 26 August 2022 at 17:00 UTC. This episode will include Heather from the Ubuntu Desktop team, plus Ryan Gorley from Freehive. They'll discuss the "beautiful new 22.04.1 video" (link provided) made by Ryan Gorley in this "behind the scenes" which covers the "methods and tools used". If you can't make the stream (on youtube and twitch), questions can be left on this thread.

==== Developing a Wayland Compositor using Mir ====

Alan Griffiths starts with a quick reminder of the aims of the Mir project. We are told the Mir codebase includes four different Wayland compositors, with a full list of these provided (with links to code). A great number of examples are provided, including "code and logic" that "proves Mir is flexible" having shipped in Ubuntu Touch and Ubuntu Frame. The document then provides instruction on "building your own compositor with Mir" including the C++ code that isn't much longer than the common "Hello World" code. This post is intended as documentation on Mir.

==== Proposal: Drop gnome-todo from default install ====

Jeremy Bicha proposes that Ubuntu Desktop "drop the GNOME Todo app" from Ubuntu 22.10 installs. Jeremy gives the history of the app in Ubuntu Desktop, plus in the GNOME project, including its new life as Endeavour as a non-core GNOME app. Jeremy reports GNOME 41 is uploading now, but mentions Endeavour 42 will "follow (maybe next week)" but needs approval due to the name change. The reasons for the drop proposal are given, which include a broken date picker (with link provided).

==== Debuginfod is coming to Ubuntu ====

Sergio Durigan Junior blogs about his work on bringing debuginfod to Ubuntu, explaining the service and how it will be deployed. We are told the deployment in Ubuntu will take place in stages, with the first expected in mere weeks; "indexing and serving all of the available debug symbols from the official Ubuntu repository" for all supported releases of Ubuntu. Later stages will occur in subsequent cycles, which will increase the usefulness of this project.

==== What’s new with Ubuntu 22.04.1? ====

Jack Wallen reminds us Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS has been released, which includes the capability of Ubuntu 20.04 LTS to upgrade to Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.

Jack tells us it's a good upgrade and that we should take it if offered the chance to upgrade; or a link is provided so we can download & install it.

Rather than a SRU (stable release updates) systemd-hwe is separating those udev rules into a separate package. Michael provides a link to systemd's hwdb for update info for entries in the database.

==== Nautilus 43 Beta Arrives in Ubuntu 22.10 Daily Builds ====

Joey Sneddon tells us the "Nautilus 43 beta has arrived in the latest daily builds of Ubuntu 22.10". Joey also gives the reason why this is big news, and that the "new-look GTK4/libadwaita version of the Nautilus file manager sits proud within Ubuntu's Yaru-themed desktop". Joey notes this app looks "more modern", but he notices an extra click is required for one function. This isn't the only change Joey noted; with the latest 43 beta builds of GNOME calculator, and GNOME Settings daemon also present on the daily.

Many new features, or changes are highlighted in this rather lengthy post. Many screen captures are shown, including some GIFs to help us better appreciate the changes, with the smaller changes as seen by Joey, just being listed.
