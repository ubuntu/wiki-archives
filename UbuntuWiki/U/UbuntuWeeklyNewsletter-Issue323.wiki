==== Mir Plans In 13.10 ====

Jono Bacon announces that Mir, Ubuntu’s new display server designed for fast, efficient, and extensible display across devices, is to be made default as XMir (an implementation of X on Mir) for users running open-source drivers in Ubuntu 13.10 along with Unity 7. He also mentions proprietary drivers will fall back to X in 13.10 but will get XMir support in 14.04 LTS, and he explains the decision is necessary to make Mir production-stable for 14.04 LTS. Bacon also answers users' possible questions.
