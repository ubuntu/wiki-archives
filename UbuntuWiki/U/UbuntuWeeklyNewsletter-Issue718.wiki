==== First Jammy Jellyfish test rebuild ====

Graham Inggs reports that the first test rebuild of Jammy Jellyfish, which started on 17 December 2021 for all components on all architectures, is complete for 'main'; but, was still running for 'universe' and 'multiverse' on arm64, armhf and riscv64. Graham thanks those who kept the builds going during the end-of-year break, and provides links of build failures requesting help with them if you're able.

==== Ubuntu Desktop GNOME plans for the incoming LTS ====

Sebastien Bacher outlines the plans for GNOME as work progresses towards the next LTS release. We are told where it stands with regards to gnome-shell, applications, GTK3/GTK4, and even some theming work that GNOME is performing upstream.
