==== Canonical Promises Easy, Secure Containerized Apps for Ubuntu with LXD ====

Christopher Tozzi, The VAR Guy, writes about the bundling of LXD, Canonical’s open source containerized app framework with the latest release of Ubuntu 15.10. He shares that with ease of use and security in mind, Canonical promotes the solution as making it “easier than ever to set containerized apps in motion and step away” and promising “hardware‐guaranteed security” for applications running in LXD. He concludes by writing, “Put together, LXD and Autopilot—both of which are homegrown tools from Canonical itself—offer streamlined orchestration and management for people using Ubuntu as a hosting platform.”
