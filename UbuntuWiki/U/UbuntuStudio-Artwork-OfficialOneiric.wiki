Concept/Overarching thematic ideas.
A "etched" look is what we're going for this release.

Apologies in advance if I'm submitting my comment in the wrong space/time in the development cycle.  
These are 3 EXCELLENT wallpapers.  Any chance that they could be included in 12.04 or released as source files for users to modify?  Thank you.

=== Logo ===
* Black or white text based on use.

=== Install Splash ===
=== Plymouth ===
=== LightDM ===
=== Wallpaper ===
* 2560x1600px is a must. PNG is preferred but JPG with no visual compression artifacts is acceptable.
* Image composition must work when used on a 4:3 (zoomed) setting where recognizable images are used. ie: Official logo. people cars, ect. Stuff people would notice looks odd out of aspect.
* ''Generally'' logo use on the wallpaper is discouraged but something tasteful will always be considered.
=== Theme ===
=== Icons ===

== UI Ideas ==
The plan is to 1st copy our GNOME layout using XFCE. Development will then continue with the "AWN Only" idea.

=== AWN Only (this will be short) ===
No panels or icons on the desktop. Just wallpaper and AWN.
