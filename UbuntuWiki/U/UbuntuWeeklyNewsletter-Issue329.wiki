Nicholas Skaggs tells us that he has been writing autopilot tests for about nine months and says "along the way I've learned or been taught some of the things that are important to remember."  Nicholas lists seven best practices and advises that if they are adopted, test cases are more reliable, easier to read, and will consistently run without a hitch.

http://www.theorangenotebook.com/2013/08/autopilot-best-practices.html

==== Brian Murray: Phasing of Stable Release Updates ====

Brian Murray writes that for some time he's wanted to gradually roll out updates to expanding subsets of Ubuntu users so that regressions can be monitored and the update process stopped if issues any are found. Brian tells us that users of Ubuntu 13.04 who install updates with update-manager are automatically participating in this process. He describes how the Phased Update process works and how the Ubuntu Error Tracker has been modified to help determine if there are any regressions.

http://www.murraytwins.com/blog/?p=127

==== Randall Ross: Ubuntu's Gets Two More "P's": Lucky 7! ====

Randall Ross reminds us that he earlier introduced us to the Five "P's" of Ubuntu. After a lively quiz that he hosted at Ubuntu Vancouver's "Cup of Ubuntu" event, he learned that there are actually two more P's that he hadn't thought of and lists Ubuntu's Seven P's.

=== In The Press ===

==== In Pictures: Ubuntu Touch starts getting real ====

Galen Grumen of ARN writes that latest beta of Ubuntu Touch shows the outlines of a possible winner. Galen provides a slide show of the various screens and concludes, "It's well thought out, nicely designed, and should appeal to users for whom iPhone and Android devices are overkill, where apps are not that important, but lightweight services are."

http://www.arnnet.com.au/slideshow/522886/pictures_ubuntu_touch_starts_getting_real/

==== Why the Ubuntu Edge is a success, even if it never exists ====

Nick Statt of CNET writes that Ubuntu Edge may fail to meet its record crowdfunding goal of $32 million as the Edge has seen its support slow to a trickle and that if it does fail, Mark Shuttleworth and the Canonical team will still have plenty of work as Mark Shuttleworth wants the community he's created to be a part of what he sees as the next big mobile jump.

http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-57597208-94/why-the-ubuntu-edge-is-a-success-even-if-it-never-exists/

==== Ubuntu Edge Smartphone Unlikely To Enter Production ====

Leo Xavier of Mobile Mag writes that when Canonical’s Ubuntu Edge ‘super-phone’ had a flying start raising around $3,250,000 within a day after the project was launched people thought that the 30 day limit to achieve their funding goal of $32,000,000 was more than enough. He compares the specifications of Ubuntu Edge, Apple iPhone 5 and Samsung Galaxy S4 and asks his readers if they are going to back the Ubuntu Edge campaign, or if they feel that too much is being asked for the hardware.

http://www.mobilemag.com/2013/08/08/ubuntu-edge-troubles/

==== Crowdfunded Ubuntu Phone Will Be A Big Success, Even If It Never Happens ====

Sharif Sakr of Forbes writes that Ubuntu Edge will pay off for both Shuttleworth and Bloomberg, regardless of whether it eventually gets the green light and concludes, "Shuttleworth may be disheartened if the Indiegogo campaign misses its target when it is forced to shut down in two weeks’ time, but logic suggests he should shrug it off and look at the upside."

==== Xubuntu 13.10 XMir ISO available for testing ====

Andrew of !WebUpd8 writes that the Xubuntu team hasn't decided yet if they will switch to XMir or continue with X.org for the 13.10 release and says that before making the decision, it needs to be properly tested. Andrew provides a link to where an Xubuntu ISO running on Mir & XMir has been made available for download.
