==== [USN-5252-1] PolicyKit vulnerability ====

Marc Deslauriers has posted a Ubuntu Security Notice warning of a Policy``Kit vulnerability. The notice warns users of Ubuntu 21.10, Ubuntu 20.04 LTS & Ubuntu 18.04 LTS that unpatched systems can allow programs to elevate privileges to administrator without authority, and gives the upgraded packages that will fix the system after install and a reboot. References are provided via link.

==== Proposed deprecation of the Canonical partner archive ====

Steve Langasek starts by outlining some of what the Canonical partner archive provided in the past, before noting it's not been used since and including Ubuntu groovy (20.10). This post alerts people to this change, and gives the Ubuntu community a chance to speak up before the partner archive is dropped.

==== Ubucon Europe 2022 - Looking for volunteers! ====

David Negreira reminds us Ubu``con Europe 2019 was a successful event, and writes about the hope for another one being planned for 2022. We are reminded what Ubu``Con is, and given a link for a 'small introductory session' which will be held on 29 January 2022 at 21:00 GMT for more details, as well as email address if we're unable to attend.

https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/ubucon-europe-2022-looking-for-volunteers/26306

==== Watch This Space! 22.04 Wallpaper Competition Coming Soon ====

Monica Ayhens-Madon tells us it's time to "brush off your cameras, digital pads" as it's time for the Jammy Jellyfish Wallpaper Competition. The competition will be run over the month of February, with winners announced no later than 10 March. More details to come, but a link is provided to the Impish Indri Competition for details on competition rules.

==== Anbox Cloud 1.12.5 has been released ====

Ru-fu relates the release is in preparation for the upcoming Ubuntu kernel release on AWS. In support of the 5.13 kernel (20.04 - focal) adaptations must be made to the /proc file system and to the mount system API. Kernel version 5.13 or later must use the 1.12.5 images; else the nested Android container will fail to start. Links to the updated components list, bugs, and upgrade instructions are provided.

==== The idea of a tutorial ====

Daniele Procida writes that almost all software needs a tutorial, and that is one of the four types of documentation in the In the Diátaxis framework. The difference between tutorials and how-to guides is discussed, and a reminder that Canonical is in the process of 'overhauling' the 'approach to documentation'. The intention is that each product should have only a single tutorial, even if it exists in multiple parts. Other fundamentals to documentation are discussed as well as the disclosure of the investment Canonical is making to maintain this documentation.

==== Firefox Nightly Begins Activating Wayland For Capable Systems ====

Michael Larabel tells us Mozilla has "begun activating Wayland support by default on Firefox Nightly" where the machine is capable of it. A link is provided for a 'bug ticket' for known issues, and to check if you're running native Wayland support via "about:support".

==== Intel's Linux Graphics Driver Patched For New Security Issue But Can Impact Performance ====

Michael Larabel informs us that whilst Intel's i915 kernel driver has been patched to prevent user-space triggered read/write faults, the fix comes with some "performance implications". We are reminded of what CVE-2022-0330 did and how it worked, and the devices affected. A link is provided to the fixed code on github, along with a note that the fix implemented was for 'simplicity' and may be refined later. We're told the speed implications vary on GPU and by the work loads, with more specific details to come.
