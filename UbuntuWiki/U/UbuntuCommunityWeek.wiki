=== Ubuntu Is Growing! ===

In just seven short years, Ubuntu has become the most popular free operating system in the world. With '''20 million users''' (give or take), an outstanding new interface, and a thriving community of contributors and fans, Ubuntu is poised to grow ten-fold over the next few years.

=== Ubuntu Where You Live ===

Do you live in a town or city? If you answered "Yes", then there are many people around you, your neighbours, who are already using and enjoying Ubuntu. Some of them may even be contributing to Ubuntu itself as artists, translators, designers, or even as programmers. Others might simply be enjoying the software and the benefits of freedom. How can you find them?
