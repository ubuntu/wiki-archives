==== Harald Sitter: KDE Framworks 5 Content Snap Techno ====

Continuing on from a prior post, Harald Sitter shares more details on the actual building and workings of content snaps specific to KDE Frameworks 5. In total near one hundred KF5, Qt5 and graphics source tarballs have been built to form the Frameworks stack. He concludes his post by saying: “Using the KDE Framworks 5 content snap KDE can create application snaps that are a fraction of the size they would be if they contained all dependencies themselves.”

Stéphane Graber tells us that the LXD and App``Armor teams have completed work on App``Armor support within LXD containers and support has landed in the latest Ubuntu kernels. Originally pushed to 16.10, it's also now available in 16.04 LTS with kernel 4.8.0 and squashfuse installed. Stéphane shows us as an example the commands for Ubuntu 16.10 to install the nextcloud snap.

=== In The Blogosphere ===

==== 10 Reasons To Use Ubuntu Linux ====

Adarsh Verma of Fossbytes lists 10 “promising characteristics of Ubuntu” which have helped it gain a top spot amongst users. Amongst those reasons are that Ubuntu is user-friendly, free, secure, has a high level of customization, has “tons of flavours”, has a supportive community, and that there is “Tons of free software in Software Center.“ He says that he chose Ubuntu as the distribution for his article as “For most of us, Ubuntu was our first Linux-based operating system.”

==== Canonical and System76 Working on Improving Unity7 HiDPI Support in Ubuntu Linux ====

Marius Nestor of Softpedia informs us that Canonical and System76 are working to improve HiDPI support for Unity 7 suggesting that the recently released patches will be for Ubuntu 16.04 and 16.10. He says that Ubuntu community has been asked to help contribute patches to existing HiDPI bugs on Launchpad and reminds us that in order to receive the latest HiDPI improvements we should always keep our PCs up to date.

==== Ubuntu Core has the keys to IoT security ====

Swapnil Bhartiya, writing for Info``World, reminds us that Ubuntu Core has been designed with security and ease of maintenance in mind. He explains how an independent software vendor can create a new snap and deliver an update to all internet connected Ubuntu Core devices in eight hours. Swapnil writes: “I see no reason for IoT vendors to no use systems like Ubuntu Core that offer optimum security and almost zero cost.”

==== This $90 Kit Converts an ODROID board into a Touchscreen #Ubuntu PC ====

He lists what the kit contains, shares some photographs of the finished device and links to the Hard``Kernel website where further information about the ODROID board can be found.

==== 8 Things That Keep You Coming Back to Ubuntu ====

Bertel King, Jr of Make``Use``Of explores the reasons why people “stick with Ubuntu” and suggest that they include a familiar name and desktop, that it can come preinstalled on new computers, it is easy to troubleshoot using web searches, and that Ubuntu is available on phones and tablets. He quickly compares Ubuntu to other distributions, admits Ubuntu isn’t perfect and ends his post by writing: “But there’s a reason you and millions of other people continue turning to Ubuntu.”
