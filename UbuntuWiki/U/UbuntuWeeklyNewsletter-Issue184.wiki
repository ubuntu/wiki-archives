==== Lucid Kernel now Frozen ====

The Lucid Kernel is now frozen. This means that the kernel moves from active development into its stabilization phase. All planned kernel features are now set, included, and enabled and the kernel team focus now moves from new enabling to testing, bug isolation, and fixing of issues found in the kernel. The kernel will now transition over to the stable maintenance team, they will be responsible for patch acceptance from here on.

What does this transition mean for you.  Now is the time to test things you care about and report any issues in Launchpad against the linux package. If you have bugs open found earlier in the cycle please retest with the latest and greatest kernel and report back whether those bugs are still present and where you tested.  The upcoming Beta-1 release is an ideal test platform.

Additionally this transition means that is will be much harder to make a change the kernel. From today patches will need to meet the same criteria as would be required for SRU[1] to a released kernel. That means that the patch must have a Launchpad bug open, it must be a fix for an actual bug being experienced in the field, it must be sent to the kernel-team email list for review, it must receive two acknowledgements from kernel team members, and finally you must test the updated kernels and report back.

 [1] https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelTeam/StableKernelMaintenance

Lucid will be with us for a long time so please help us make this the best kernel possible.  Please test beta-1 and report your issues. Thanks!

https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel-announce/2010-March/000689.html

==== Ubuntu 10.04 beta 1 freeze now in effect ====

We are now one week from the first beta release of 10.04, scheduled for March 18 https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LucidReleaseSchedule and have just entered beta freeze.

During the freeze, all uploads to main must be approved by a member of the release team [1], so if you have fixes which are important to get in, please do get in touch as soon as possible. Uploads to universe require a manual push through the queue, but are not subject to release management approval.

Issues which are important for the beta release will be tracked by the release team here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/lucid/+bugs?field.milestone=21446

If you have bugs on this list, please fix them at the earliest possible opportunity, or (in consultation with other developers and the Ubuntu QA team) un-milestone them if they are not required for beta. If you have bugs you think should be on this list, talk with the Ubuntu QA team or the Ubuntu release team about having them milestoned.

Please also do not lose sight of the list of bugs affecting the release as a whole: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/lucid/+bugs

Over the next few days, please pay attention to eliminating inconsistencies in the archive, including:

* uninstallable packages in main and restricted - http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/testing/lucid_probs.html
* obsolete packages which still have reverse-dependencies - and http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/NBS/

Archive administrators should spend time ensuring that any pending main<->universe component changes have been processed http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches.txt Developers, if you are waiting for something on this list, please help out by filing good main inclusion reports.

==== Canonical Blog: Intel, Eucalyptus and Canonical join forces to help user build cloud infrastructures confidently ====

A few weeks ago myself and Dustin Kirkland had the privilege of travelling to the Intel facility in Hillsboro, Oregon to work with Billy Cox, Rekha Raghu, Paul Guermonprez, Trevor Cooper and Kamal Natesan of Intel and Dan Nurmi and Neil Soman of Eucalyptus Systems and a few others on developing a proof of concept whitepaper on the use of Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud on Intel Xeon processors (Nehalem). http://www.intel.com/software/cloudbuilder

The whitepaper is published today on the Intel site (registration required) so it seems like a good time to talk about why we collaborated.

The Intel Cloud Builder program is intended to develop some best practice information for businesses and institutions looking to take advantage of the promise of cloud computing. As we do consistently with UEC, we are being specific when we talk about cloud as the ability to build Infrastructure as a Service behind a corporate firewall – that is on your own systems, protected by your own security protocols.

In Portland we had access to some great hardware and as an ex-Intel man, it was good to mess directly with the metal again. Intel defined a number of use and test cases and the guys from Intel, Eucalyptus and myself were able to have some fun putting UEC through its paces. And the results were good. We documented them and the whitepaper gives numerous code and scenario examples to help anyone new to cloud to get up to speed really quickly and the make the most of the capabilities of the Xeon processor in supporting an internal IaaS infrastructure. You can find out how to get started on UEC with existing documentation. but this whitepaper takes it to the next stage. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEC

Being able to test the software as part of the Intel Cloud Builder program and jointly publish this whitepaper is a great endorsement of what is still a young technology. And I hope it will give users confidence to start building their own UEC deployment on x86 technology.

==== Call for Testing: Cluster Stack – Load Balancing ====

Continuing with the Ubuntu Cluster Stack testing, it is time now for Load Balancing. During UDS, we discussed that we should based the Load Balancing as part of the Ubuntu Cluster Stack using Keepalived due to its speed. However, since the main Cluster Stack is based in Pacemaker, we decided to do Load Balancing with Pacemaker/ldirectord too.

The wiki page showing the procedure is here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ClusterStack/LucidTesting#Load%20Balancing If you find any bugs in the documentation, please let us know by leaving your comments at the END of the wikipage in preparation for the Documentation that might be included in the Ubuntu Server Guide.

All the packages are now in the archives. So please test the configurations and if you find any bugs, please report them in LP.

==== Dylan McCall: New stuff for the Ubiquity slideshow(Proposed) ====

Remember that slideshow when you did a fresh install of Ubuntu Karmic? For Lucid, ubiquity-slideshow is rocking, if I may say so myself. This is a really simple project with the goal of providing an introductory slideshow that runs when people install Ubuntu. The ubiquity-slideshow packages are all content packages, then Ubiquity displays that content at the right time.

The slideshow is implemented with Webkit, since all the cool people use Webkit. (It also renders things nicely, it's flexible, quick, we can quickly throw it on the web, people can make content really easily, and Javascript allows us a good split between interactive goodies and actual functionality like installing the operating system).

Michael Forrest and Otto Greenslade, from the design team, sent me a mockup and some graphics to fit with the exciting new Ubuntu branding. I worked them into the CSS and played with the text a little. Thus, behold, the proposed new look for the Ubuntu slideshow! http://people.ubuntu.com/~dylanmccall/ubiquity-slideshow-ubuntu/redesign-lucid/ubuntu-transitions/slides/index.html#controls

Keep in mind this is still a proposal, just fully implemented (granted a few clunky bits).
Any constructive feedbacks or cries of “stop, you maniac!” are certainly not in vain.

==== Alan Pope: Why (I think) Ubuntu is Better Than Windows ====

When comparing operating systems people tend to roll out the same old reasons every time. I think those of us who use Ubuntu are already aware that we have less viruses than Windows, less malware, it’s free of cost and so on. I’m sure we’ve pointed out plenty of times that you’re legally entitled to copy the CD and even create your own remix.

However I wanted to look at some of the things I’ve done recently on Ubuntu that under Windows would be costly, difficult or impossible. Here's my list:

* Hardware support is better than you think
* Access more than 4GiB RAM on a 32-bit install out of the box
* Easily create a bootable, functional operating system on a USB stick
* Find out where each file comes from
* Email me when system updates are available
* Go from blank disk to fully installed in under an hour
* Move a hard disk
* Compiling and packaging applications for older OS releases
* Fixing a bug
* Re-install the OS and Applications without losing your data

Alan goes into detail about each of the above bullet points at the link below.

==== The Linux Desktop Will Have Its Day: Q&A With Canonical Founder Mark Shuttleworth ====

Linux``Insider's Jack M. Germain had an opportunity to interview Canonical founder Mark Shuttleworth recently, and he asked Shuttleworth questions such as "Given the growing reach of the Ubuntu server and desktop editions, what do you see as the driving factors for their acceptance?", and, "What will take Ubuntu to the next level?" To the second question Shuttleworth answered, "On the consumer front, we're seeing a shift in the way people think about alternative platforms to Windows amongst the PC companies. It used to be a kiss of death to present yourself as a genuine alternative to Windows. But the success of the Web and the success of Apple have really made the PC companies think that it is possible to offer something that is perceived to be valuable even if it is not Windows." Click on the following link to read what else Shuttleworth had to say, or listed to the Podcast of the interview.

==== PC-BSD 8.0 vs. Kubuntu 9.10 Benchmarks ====

Michael Larabel of Phoronix states that PC-BSD 8.0 was released last week and he took this opportunity to deliver a fresh set of PC-BSD 8.0 x64 benchmarks against Kubuntu 9.10 x86_64. In a majority of the tests, Kubuntu 9.10 performed better than PC-BSD 8.0, but the tests that Larabel used in this article are just a subset of what is available to run on both platforms via the Phoronix Test Suite so for those deciding between running PC-BSD / FreeBSD it is important to run the tests relevant to you and also consider the other features at hand for both free software operating systems. Click on this link to see the details of how Kubuntu 9.10 x86_64 compares to PC-BSD 8.0 x64.

http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=pcbsd8_benchmarks&num=1

==== Ubuntu 10.04 To Hang Onto Old Intel Driver ====

Phoronix's Michael Larabel says that when it comes to Intel's X.Org driver for Linux, xf86-video-intel, the most recent release was version 2.10 and it arrived in early January complete with Pineview (their next-generation Intel Atom systems) support, X-Video improvements, and various other features. The xf86-video-intel 2.11 driver is now emerging as their next quarterly update that brings in the KMS page-flipping and DRI2 swap events support. However, Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, which is set to be released in April, will not be shipping with either of these drivers. Instead Canonical's Bryce Harrington has announced that they have decided to stick with the xf86-video-intel 2.9 driver that was released last September. The decision to stick with this aging release is based on the fact that Intel stripped out user-space mode-setting (UMS) support from the xf86-video-intel 2.10 driver and that leaves this X.Org driver to only supporting kernel mode-setting.

==== Redesigning Ubuntu – behind the scenes on 10.04 ====

Dave Walker of Linux``User reminds us that the next version of Ubuntu – codename Lucid Lynx – will be the 10.04 release, and is scheduled to be released and declared stable in April.  As a long-term support version, coupled with increasing popularity, this is undoubtedly the most important Ubuntu release to date. Walker was privileged to be invited to the Canonical offices in London recently to preview the image changes and comment on how Linux``User might adopt them; offer opinions on how he felt the community would interpret the changes, and offer feedback. Walker states that he is really positive about the changes and he's greatly motivated with Canonical's extended effort with requesting non-employee influence.  It really helps reinforce Canonical’s stance of community empowerment.  Particularly, as they made it clear they wanted to increase community involvement in this area which hasn’t traditionally had a massive community commitment.

==== Taking Ubuntu 9.10 Netbook Remix out for a Spin ====

IT News Today's Jeremy La``Croix tells us that for quite some time he has been intrigued by Ubuntu’s Netbook Remix (UNR), but he's never given it a shot up until now. La``Croix says that he's been using UNR for a couple of months now. When he first started playing with it, he didn’t own a netbook, so instead he tried it out on a Dell Latitude E6400 laptop. About a month later, he was gifted a Dell Mini 10 netbook, which afforded him the opportunity to try UNR in it’s intended environment. Overall, even though La``Croix typically doesn’t use GNOME, the way the desktop was presented in UNR 9.10 was actually pretty cool. "Sure, it took some getting used to, and I probably have strange tastes, but I did enjoy using it, despite the little issues I ran into." UNR also seems like the best choice for any compatible Netbook, because Lx``Croix says that he has tried using Windows on Netbooks and it’s not pretty at all.

==== Ubuntu Server: The Linux OS Dark Horse ====

Kenneth Hess of Server``Watch knows that everyone has heard of Ubuntu Linux and how great it is on the desktop, but have you heard that there's a server version of that same uber-cool operating system? There is, and you should know about it. Ubuntu Server not only follows the same twice yearly updates (April and October) as its desktop counterpart does, but it also benefits from unsurpassed commercial support, consulting and training available through Canonical. Ubuntu melds outstanding performance with easy installation and excellent hardware support. Add those features to its superior commercial support, long-term support commitment and unique cloud computing platform, and you have a formidable rival to its entrenched competition. Keep an eye on Ubuntu, it's likely to be a photo finish for this dark horse.

http://www.serverwatch.com/trends/article.php/3870141/Ubuntu-Server-The-Linux-OS-Dark-Horse.htm

==== Ubuntu, The Ultimate Linux Distribution ====

Dani``Web's Ken Hess thinks that from its Debian roots to its commercially available support to its overwhelming popularity, Ubuntu is the ultimate Linux distribution. Ubuntu is the distribution most often recommended to users new to Linux or those switching from other distributions. Its ease of installation, quick boot times, GNOME user interface and twice yearly major updates keep it at the top of everyone's best distribution list. And, every two years, a new LTS (Long Term Support) version is released. Ubuntu has two major subversions: Desktop and Server. For the desktop, you may choose something other than the default GNOME desktop: Kubuntu, Xubuntu, Edubuntu and a Netbook Remix. On the server side, you can select the standard Ubuntu server or the Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud. It's no wonder that Ubuntu is the world's most popular Linux distribution with several choices for any purpose or application, an absolutely easy to install system, commercial support and a successful track record of security and popularity that speaks volumes since its inception.

==== Ubuntu Software Centre Gets Brand New Look for Lucid; Paid software to feature soon? ====

In this article the OMG!Ubuntu folks will take you on a screen shot tour of the fresh new look of the Ubuntu Software Centre. The screen shots show the "Featured" button that is now in a prominently place of display. The article notes that the application view has been brightened up as well.  The author also notes that a new "Themes and Tweaks category has been added.

==== Ubuntu hits HTC's Touch Pro2, is any Windows Mobile handset safe? ====

Tim Stevens, engadget, takes a look at Brandon Miniman's post on pocketnow.com, in which Miniman demos Ubuntu 8.04 on an HTC Touch Pro2. This article not only has the video but also walks you though how to install Ubuntu on the device. .  Also noted is the fact that Ubuntu also runs on the Xperia X1.  Stevens states, "It looks quite easy: just download a 200MB zip, extract it to your phone, then run an exe within. A few moments later you'll be in open source heaven, and, from what we can tell looking at the video below, it works remarkably well"  http://www.engadget.com/2010/03/09/ubuntu-hits-htcs-touch-pro2-is-any-windows-mobile-handset-safe/
