=== Launchpad News ===

==== Ending support for multi-tenancy ====

Curtis Hovey writes, "Launchpad is ending support for multi-tenancy for branches and bugs to ensure that projects can manage the disclosure of private information. This is a fundamental change to how launchpad permits communities to share projects. Very few users will be affected by this change, but several communities will need to change how they work with private bugs and branches."

http://blog.launchpad.net/coming-features/ending-support-for-multi-tenancy

==== Customisable bug listings in beta! ====

Dan Harrop-Griffiths posts, "The information displayed with bug listings is often not what you want to see – you might not be interested in bug heat and want to see bug age, but it’s not there.  Looking at this problem, we've come up with a new beta feature: custom bug listings.  A lot of you have said that you'd like to be able to filter bugs in a way that works best for you."

http://blog.launchpad.net/bug-tracking/customisable-bug-listings-in-beta

==== Jason Gerard DeRose: Note on Ubuntu One dropping CouchDB sync ====

"In the short run, this has little impact on Novacut," writes Jason De``Rose of Novacut.  "Because of the scaling difficulties presented by the particular way Ubuntu One needed to use CouchDB, we couldn't reliably sync larger databases like dmedia through Ubuntu One anyway, so we weren't counting on this being available (not that it wouldn't have been nice)."

De``Rose says Novacut will follow U1DB development closely and in the end they may stick with CouchDB at least on the server-side.

"Regardless, I'm going to be involved with the U1DB efforts where I imagine my experience building "painfully ambitious" desktop apps that use documented-oriented databases will prove useful," concludes De``Rose.

==== Randall Ross: Ubuntu Community Lexicon, Part 2 & 3 ====

In this ongoing series of post UDS-P blog articles, Randal Ross disgrams the Ubuntu Community.

Randall says, "During UDS-P, I asked publicly for a favour: When we speak about community, lets use adjectives. Let's use more than one adjective if one isn't enough. Let's use precise language to help frame the problems we are trying to solve in the Precise cycle.

To that end, and being a visual thinker, I have begun to map out the Ubuntu community as a first step in developing a lexicon. I hope this will help us frame our discussions and develop a common understanding of what our community looks like."

==== Jono Bacon: The Ubuntu Commons ====

"One of the most wonderful things about Open Source and collaborative community is that every community member participates in a commons; a shared area of community real-estate in which we can all contribute," says Bacon.  In this post Bacon takes a look at the Ubuntu "commons".

He looks at: Our Commons, An Open Commons, Ubuntu for Everyone, and The Opportunity.

==== Ubuntu tells dumped CouchDB: It's not you, it's me ====

==== Will Ubuntu PCs in Retail Succeed Where Mail Order Failed? ====

Christopher Tozzi shares some thoughts on Canonical's recent announcements regarding retail sales of Ubuntu in Asia and Europe. Tossi reviews some of the history of Ubuntu sales, including efforts by Dell primarily in the United States and speculates whether the different market and model (stores vs online) will improve their chances. Either way he says "it's reassuring for the open source community to see Canonical continuing to invest in desktop Linux."
