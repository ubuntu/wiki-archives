== Ubuntu Studio Kernel Team Landing Page ==

== Become a member ==

The Ubuntu Studio kernel team is a restricted team, and is reserved for those assigned to maintain or develop kernels for Ubuntu Studio. One can still help in development, and maintenance, even if not being a member of the team. And this is rather a nessecary first step before becoming a member. 

First thing to do is probably to subscribe to the <nowiki>[[https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntustudio/+spec/ubuntustudio-kernel|Kernel Blueprint]]</nowiki>, where any planning for the kernels are done.

Documentation for Ubuntu Studio kernel maintainers can be found at <nowiki>[[UbuntuStudio-KernelTeamDocumentation|Kernel Team Documentation]]</nowiki>.
