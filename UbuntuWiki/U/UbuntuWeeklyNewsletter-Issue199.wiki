==== Ubuntu Translations Interviews: Milo Casagrande (Italian Team) ====

Ubuntu is brought to users in their own language by a large community of volunteer translators, who tirelessly work on localizing every part of the operating system on every release. In this series of interviews we’ll get to know who they are, about their language and how they work. This week we’re introducing you to '''Milo Casagrande''', the Italian translation team coordinator.

'''Q: Could you tell us a bit about you and the language you help translate Ubuntu into?'''

MC: I’m a Java developer by day, but always with my Ubuntu/GNOME/Linux hat on. :-) I’m helping coordinate the Italian Ubuntu translation team, and also helping translate Ubuntu into the beautiful romantic language that is Italian.

'''Q: How and when did you become an Ubuntu translator?'''

MC: I started contributing to Ubuntu translations just after the Warty release, at the time I was helping out with GNOME translations. When I started contributing there wasn’t a real Italian team but soon after I was contacted by Matthew East; we started to set up and structure a team for that purpose.

Want to read more about what Milo has to say about translations and the Italian Lo``Co team?  The full interview can be found at:

http://fridge.ubuntu.com/node/2064

==== Meet Steve Kowalik ====

Matthew Revell interviews '''Steve Kowalik''' in this Launchpad interview.

Steve Kowalik recently joined the Soyuz part of the Launchpad team at Canonical, so I asked him the, by now familiar, questions!

'''Matthew: What were you doing before you joined the Launchpad team?'''

Steve: I worked on the Ubuntu Mobile team for 2.5 years before switching to the Launchpad team to work on Soyuz.

'''Matthew: Can we see something that you’ve worked on from that time?'''

Steve: You sure can. The images and large parts of the integration work for Ubuntu Netbook Remix 9.04 and Ubuntu Netbook Edition 9.10 were done by me. I was also responsible for image builds for the three ARM sub-architectures for the 9.10 release.

'''Matthew: Where do you work?'''

Steve: I work from my apartment in Sydney, Australia.

'''Matthew: What did you do before working at Canonical?'''

Steve: I worked at a company in Burwood, NSW specializing in satellite communications, and worked on supporting and developing their in-house Debian-derived distribution.

==== Debian Import Freeze in effect ====

Per https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MaverickReleaseSchedule, the Debian Import Freeze is now in effect.  Please remember that if you are waiting for bug fixes from Debian for [Maverick], you will now need to file your sync requests explicitly.

For more information go to:

https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2010-June/030945.html

==== 100 Ubuntu Users Project announcement ====

Belinda Lopez has kicked off a great initiative to get 100 new Ubuntu Users this cycle.  Here is a little about this effort and how you can participate:

* Project Overview

Based loosely on the 100 Papercuts concept lead by David Siegel of the Design Team, this project aims to introduce Ubuntu to 100 new users in this cycle. Project team members and individuals are encouraged to each introduce Ubuntu to a new person and track that work on the team or personal wiki. The number 100 was chosen b/c it is manageable, easy to track and achievable by any dedicated team or person.

* Project Design

Each team/person will create a wiki page with a table with 100 rows with the following column titles:

Team Member | New User | Date Introduced | Notes (can include feedback from the new user, observations, blog posts, links to pics, anything but keep it short |

That's it! We just want a tangible way to show progress and activity, doesn't need to be fancy or formal just help promote Ubuntu to new users and let the world know about it. Once you reach 100, then we start over or transition to another level of mentoring.

To find out more about this project and how you can participate go to:

https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-women/2010-June/002886.html

* YORBA [Shotwell] MUST include 'random [aka shuffle]' option in slideshow - http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/idea/25199/

Ubuntu Brainstorm is a community site geared toward letting you add your ideas for Ubuntu. You can submit your own idea, or vote for or against another idea. http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/

=== LoCo News ===

==== LoCo Health Check ====

Lo``Co Health Check sessions on the 1st Tuesday of each month in #ubuntu-locoteams. In this session if you have any queries from your team or ideas you want to get some feedback on this would be a great  place to bring them up and chat to others in the community. The idea is that we, the council, will add some topics we’d like to share with the community or get feedback on.

For more information on the Lo``Co Health Check sessions or more about the LoCo Council go to:

https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/loco-contacts/2010-June/004625.html

==== LoCo Teams Microblog Tag ====

Paul Tagliamonte announces a new hashtag when microblogging about Lo``Co specific stuff.  Paul encourages everyone to use #locoteams for all microblogging needs whether it be twitter, identi.ca, or status.net.

For more information on the use of #locoteams go to:

http://blog.paultags.com/2010/06/locoteams-microblog-tag/

==== Encouraging LoCo Teams to talk more ====

Laura Czajkowski of the Lo``Co Council calls for more people to drop by in #ubuntu-locoteams on IRC, chatting and meeting more people from all other teams.  It helps bounce ideas off one another and get to know others in the community.  This channel is open to everyone, a lot of the Lo``Co Council hang out in here also so it’s a good place to start if you want to talk to them on IRC.  Laura, like Paul in the article above, also talks about the new #locoteams hashtag taking off.  She reminds everyone to tweet/dent with the #locoteams about an idea or when planning an event to let more people know the work you are planning on doing.

http://www.lczajkowski.com/2010/06/25/encouraging-loco-teams-to-talk-more/

==== Country info in the LoCo Directory ====

There is now a country list has been added into the Lo``Co Directory that is shipped by the iso-codes package. So instead of a text field where you type in which country your Lo``Co is from, you can pick it from a list now.

The obvious benefit of this is, we don't have "USA", "US", "United States", "United States of America", etc. or "United Kingdom", "UK", etc. in all their variations in the database, but only one name and we can more easily match teams, venues and events in the future, which will make the LD more fun.

We also added continent info that will make the LD more usable in the
future.

To find out more about this feature or how you can help with the Lo``Co directory go to:

https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/loco-contacts/2010-June/004594.html

==== You want to know why I am still amazed by the Ubuntu community? and how to improve your loco? ====

In this article, Christophe Sauthier, Lo``Co Council member, talks about how to improve our Ubuntu Lo``Co communities. Christophe reminds the community that the Lo``Co Council meets every 3rd Tuesday of the month in #ubuntu-meeting on freenode.net; where there is a Lo``Co Council meeting.  He also notes that the easiest way to contact the Lo``Co Council is by using their mailing list: loco-council@lists.ubuntu.com.

If you want to know more about improving your Lo``Co team, or communicating with the Lo``Co Council go to:

http://www.reponses.net/blog/2010/06/24/577-you-want-to-know-why-i-am-still-amazed-by-the-ubuntu-community-and-how-to-improve-your-loco-this-post-is-for-you

==== California Team: Ubuntu Hour in Lake Forest #3 ====

Curious to see about how some Lo``Co teams run an Ubuntu Hour.  Nathan Haines of the California team posts their up and coming one that is to be held in Lake Forest.  Here is how he describes the general idea for an Ubuntu Hour - we meet up for an hour someplace public wearing a visible Ubuntu Logo (clothing, sticker or something) and just chat for an hour.

To check out Nathan Haines journal post to find out more about the upcoming Ubuntu Hour, as well as ideas for hosting your own Ubuntu Hour go to:

==== openSUSE conference looking for Ubuntu participation ====

The openSUSE folks are holding a conference in Nuremberg from 20-23 October. They are working on a "cross-pollination" type track at the event, and would like to see participation from Ubuntu contributors:

"Basically the idea is to get multiple distros and upstream projects under one roof and have an open discussion/meet with presentations, talks, workshops and maybe even some hacking on common ground.  The ultimate aim is to advance the Linux cause and promote some cross project love.  The potential topics could be anything from a11y to zealot handling.  Things that all projects suffer from and things that the closed competition potentially do better.  If anyone from Ubuntu would like to propose a talk, please do so by emailing cfp at opensuse.org/"

To find about more about this event and how you can get involved go to:

https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/loco-contacts/2010-June/004624.html

=== Launchpad News ===

==== Launchpad read-only 23.00 UTC 1st July ====

Launchpad’s web interface will be read-only, with other aspects offline, for around 90 minutes from 23.00 UTC on the 1st of July 2010.

This is to allow for the release of the latest Launchpad code.

'''Starts:''' 23.00 UTC 1st July 2010

'''Expected back online:''' 00.30 UTC 2nd July 2010

For more information go to:

http://blog.launchpad.net/notifications/launchpad-read-only-23-00-utc-1st-july

==== Launchpad bug mail changes ====

Brian Murray discusses one of the changes he is making as he does a rotation with the Launchpad bugs team.  Brian states, "I am currently working on a Launchpad Enhancement Proprosal dealing with improved bug notifications and subscriptions. As a part of this work I thought I’d work on an easy bug about modifying the string in a new bug message to say “You have been assigned” instead of “You have been subscribed”. This ended up being more complicated than I had initially thought because there are actually multiple issues in that report and I had to learn the email notification system. But this makes the fix that much more rewarding."

To find out more about this change/fix go to:

http://www.murraytwins.com/blog/?p=77

==== Take the Launchpad user survey! ====

There are all sorts of different ways in which we in Canonical’s Launchpad team keep in touch with people who use Launchpad: informal conversations on IRC, attending Ubuntu Developer Summits, formal user research and so on.

We want to hear from as many people who use Launchpad as possible. To help get there, I’ve created a survey with five questions. Tell us what you like about Launchpad, what you don’t and what sort of work you do in Launchpad:

==== Jorge Castro: Application Menu Status for 25 June ====

From Jorge's Stompbox comes this update on the application menu status in the Unity UI. "Ted and Cody have released indicator-appmenu 0.0.7 and appmenu-gtk 0.0.8 which are now in Maverick and the Lucid PPA".  Jorge tells users, "We’re getting close to including the menu by default in Unity (right now you have to explicitly install it). There’s a few issues left to iron out, basically submenus and some still-partial menus. That’s where the focus is right now. Seb128 and didrocks will then determine when to flip the menu on as default. The DX team are going through existing bugs right now, so now would be a good time to double check an issue to see if it still affects you."

==== Jorge Castro: Adopt an Upstream: Victor Vargas ====

At Jorge's Stompbox, check out the great work that Victor Vargas has been doing with the Rhythmbox packages, and many others. Adopting upstream packages is a great way to take care of a certain class of bugs within Launchpad, and Victor is worthy of many kudos in this regard. Jorge took time to ask Victor how he got started and what tips he could share with Jorge to pass along to people who might be interested.

==== Mike Rushton: FOSScon 2010 followup ====

This article is a great overview of several workshops at FOSScon 2010.  LeftyFB and Joe travel to Rochester NY, and share their findings.  Discussed in the article was Jorge Castro's talk.  Here's what the writer had to say:

"Then we were off to “Learning how to fish: A self-help guide to finding Linux help on the internet” by Jorge Castro from Canonical. This talk was a complete opposite from the previously mentioned. Jorge is insanely good at giving a presentation. He first went on about how people perceive getting help in open source projects and hit the nail on the head doing so. Then he went on to how things should be done. Everything from how to properly use google, search forums and contacting the right people to get the most bang for your buck. Add to that, Jorge was very good at keeping everyone included in the discussion by asking questions from the audience and even adding in some topics that were brought up."

=== In The Press ===

==== The Spirit of Ubuntu ====

Emery Fletcher accounts his experience of introducing Ubuntu to his 88 year old father-in-law. Who, after surmounting the usual growing pains accompanying a new Operating System, introduced Ubuntu to his home aid, a Haitian man by the name of R.C.. R.C. happened to be assisting a school in Haiti by gathering donated computer hardware to send down to one of the schools devastated by the recent earthquake. Ron provided several CDs of Ubuntu 9.04 to accompany R.C. and those donated computers to Haiti.

=== In The Blogosphere ===

==== The Future of Nautilus ====

Take a look at the future of Nautilus in Garrett Le``Sage's weblog post. This is a great 'work in progress' view with some UI screenshots and concept ideas. One of the overall goals is the goal to give Nautilus "All the functionality that you need. Nothing you don’t." For those of us who enjoy using Nautilus, this is a must read article.

==== Introduction to Unity Launcher ====

Christian Giordano writes about the Unity launcher and how it's changing. One of the biggest concerns and challenges in the Unity theming is making it touch friendly. Unlike a dock, where icons scale to size depending on the number, the menu in Unity uses an accordion effect to maximize screen real estate, while allowing for larger icons, which will be useful when on touch devices. Christian also includes information on finding keyboard shortcuts and a video demo for Unity.
