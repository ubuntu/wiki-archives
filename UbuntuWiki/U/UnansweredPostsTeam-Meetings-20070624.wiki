Jun 23 20:00:04 <Jacob> Welcome to the 3rd (?) meeting. Yay...
Jun 23 20:00:36 <Jacob> Nothing on schedule to talk about tonight other than the new system kidders wrote and ajmorris_ styled up
Jun 23 20:00:42 <ajmorris_> agenda...?
Jun 23 20:00:47 <Jacob> ^
Jun 23 20:01:21 <Jacob> so basically, we're killing off uaresolved tagging as of the last meeting, right?
Jun 23 20:01:42 <ajmorris_> that was my understanding
Jun 23 20:01:47 <Jacob> ok, just making sure
Jun 23 20:01:55 <madmetal_spyros> ok i missed last meeting :(
Jun 23 20:02:07 <kidders> bad boy
Jun 23 20:02:07 <Jacob> hehe no prob madmetal_spyros
Jun 23 20:02:20 <Jacob> actually you were the only one remembering to put the tag in the posts lol
Jun 23 20:02:27 <madmetal_spyros> yeap :P
Jun 23 20:02:34 <reclusivemonkey> I did pop one in the other day...
Jun 23 20:02:34 <madmetal_spyros> cause i was up to the idea :P
Jun 23 20:02:39 <ajmorris_> LOL
Jun 23 20:02:44 <Jacob> hehe
Jun 23 20:02:52 <Jacob> yeah reclusivemonkey i saw you in here once
Jun 23 20:02:54 <madmetal_spyros> so i will continue :P pfff
Jun 23 20:02:57 <Jacob> lol
Jun 23 20:04:00 <Jacob> madmetal_spyros: you still need a UA tracker account.. have you seen the system yet?
Jun 23 20:04:06 <Jacob> http://ua.codechunk.net
Jun 23 20:04:20 <reclusivemonkey> lol I meant a "uaresolved"... I agree its probably better to track "our" resolved threads outside the forums. Its probably only of interest to ourselves...
Jun 23 20:04:22 <madmetal_spyros> yeap i just saw it ;)
Jun 23 20:04:33 <Jacob> i agree reclusivemonkey ;)
Jun 23 20:04:58 <Jacob> lol and once again kidders beat me to the chase
Jun 23 20:05:03 <madmetal_spyros> Jacob kidders ajmorris_ i need an account :P
Jun 23 20:05:05 <kidders> i did?
Jun 23 20:05:08 <kidders> what did i do?!
Jun 23 20:05:10 <Jacob> err.. hmm
Jun 23 20:05:12 <Jacob> wait
Jun 23 20:05:28 <Jacob> nvm.. that was the queue cron job speaking
Jun 23 20:05:49 <Jacob> an error popped up when i was adding a user, from UF saying that there is a 15-second search barrier
Jun 23 20:05:51 <madmetal_spyros> brb
Jun 23 20:05:52 <reclusivemonkey> I think another idea for the website is to put a list of "official" HOWTOs that we can point people to for the more obvious answers, like http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu:Feisty
Jun 23 20:05:53 <ajmorris_> and don't for get to add the site to an rss live bookmark :)
Jun 23 20:06:09 <kidders> Jacob, oh sorry... my fault
Jun 23 20:06:11 <Jacob> ah ajmorris_ i forgot about that
Jun 23 20:06:16 <Jacob> nah, no prob
Jun 23 20:06:41 <Jacob> madmetal_spyros: i'm /msg'ing you your username and password
Jun 23 20:07:43 <kidders> reclusivemonkey, Jacob & I were chatting about something related to that
Jun 23 20:07:48 <kidders> ... i think it's a good idea
Jun 23 20:07:51 <kidders> ... personally
Jun 23 20:07:52 <Jacob> yeah
Jun 23 20:08:17 <ajmorris_> hmm....
Jun 23 20:08:19 <Jacob> i wasn't able to find the Beginners team responses.... i thought they were there, but apparently they aren't
Jun 23 20:08:39 <ajmorris_> that is what the UF-BT is doing though... they are making wikis for more obvious answers
Jun 23 20:08:39 <madmetal_spyros> back
Jun 23 20:08:41 <reclusivemonkey> encouraging people to use the existing guides where appropriate can only be a good thing
Jun 23 20:08:51 <kidders> yeah
Jun 23 20:08:51 <Jacob> yeah
Jun 23 20:09:02 <kidders> if we were to compile ourselves a list of good urls...
Jun 23 20:09:17 <kidders> ... we could have the uatracker help us insert them into posts
Jun 23 20:09:24 <reclusivemonkey> ajmorris_: yeah, I don't think the things that slip through will be *as* obvious
Jun 23 20:09:41 <ajmorris_> kk
Jun 23 20:10:04 <Jacob> kidders: the problem with having the tracking system insert them is account access for one thing
Jun 23 20:10:15 <reclusivemonkey> once we have some results from the tracker, we can even spot things that might be asked frequently and add them to the appropriate wiki(s)
Jun 23 20:10:39 <Jacob> i think we just need a page with them on it or a script (greasemonkey anyone?) to insert them
Jun 23 20:10:45 <kidders> Jacob, i was thinking of something much more low-tech...
Jun 23 20:10:53 <kidders> ... that would only be semi-automated
Jun 23 20:10:56 <Jacob> ah
Jun 23 20:11:04 <kidders> losing the personal touch to posting...
Jun 23 20:11:07 <kidders> ... would be bad
Jun 23 20:11:21 <Jacob> lol
Jun 23 20:11:53 <kidders> but at the same time, it would be nice to be able to select howto URLs from lists, rather than having to search for them & type them manually?
Jun 23 20:12:04 <Jacob> yeah i agree with that
Jun 23 20:12:07 <kidders> reclusivemonkey, yep :D
Jun 23 20:12:26 <Jacob> i think we could have a text file on the ua site with canned responses / links
Jun 23 20:12:38 <Jacob> and then use a firefox greasemonkey script to fetch them on the reply form
Jun 23 20:12:47 <kidders> Jacob, perhaps a firefox plugin that looks like a live bookmark...
Jun 23 20:12:47 <Jacob> and put them as a select menu or something
Jun 23 20:12:53 <Jacob> yeah
Jun 23 20:12:59 <Jacob> something along those lines
Jun 23 20:14:02 <kidders> i've been working on a uateam toolbar plugin...
Jun 23 20:14:14 <ajmorris_> ooh :)
Jun 23 20:14:19 <kidders> ...with a collection of gizmos in it that might be useful for the team
Jun 23 20:14:27 <kidders> ...
Jun 23 20:14:34 <ajmorris_> good idea kidders :)
Jun 23 20:14:39 <Jacob> dang kidders you are doing everything ;)
Jun 23 20:14:42 <kidders> hehe :)
Jun 23 20:14:44 <kidders> sorry
Jun 23 20:14:53 <Jacob> nothin to be sorry 'bout
Jun 23 20:15:02 <kidders> heh
Jun 23 20:15:07 <kidders> it just strikes me that ...
Jun 23 20:15:16 <kidders> perhaps an embedded drop-down list that would let ...
Jun 23 20:15:30 <kidders> people select good howtos...
Jun 23 20:15:42 <kidders> and auto-insert the url into a post...
Jun 23 20:15:46 <kidders> would be a nice addition
Jun 23 20:16:00 <Jacob> yeah
Jun 23 20:16:00 * kidders wonders if that made any sense
Jun 23 20:16:06 <Jacob> i get ya
Jun 23 20:16:07 <madmetal_spyros> yeap
Jun 23 20:16:17 <reclusivemonkey> kidders: yep, that would certainly be helpful
Jun 23 20:16:18 <Jacob> and greasemonkey scripts are able to accomplish that
Jun 23 20:16:24 <kidders> :)
Jun 23 20:16:55 <kidders> Jacob ... it's really only a matter of a few lines of javascript
Jun 23 20:17:00 <kidders> ... thankfully
Jun 23 20:17:01 <kidders> hehe
Jun 23 20:17:09 <Jacob> the scripts are all javascript... all that is needed is a little JS + DOM + AJAX (to fetch the canned list)
Jun 23 20:17:11 <Jacob> yeah
Jun 23 20:17:24 <kidders> yup
Jun 23 20:18:03 * ajmorris_ feels out of place..... the only code i know ATM is HTML and CSS
Jun 23 20:18:04 <ajmorris_> lol
Jun 23 20:18:09 <Jacob> hehe
Jun 23 20:18:25 <ajmorris_> and soon php....

Jun 23 20:20:01 <kidders> blender
Jun 23 20:20:05 <Jacob> tons of ubuntu apps are in python
Jun 23 20:20:07 <kidders> gimp
Jun 23 20:20:14 <ajmorris_> wow.....
Jun 23 20:20:17 <ajmorris_> this is awesome
Jun 23 20:20:21 <Jacob> heck, ubuntu.com used to be all python before they switched to Drupal
Jun 23 20:20:21 <kidders> scientology
Jun 23 20:20:24 <Jacob> lol
Jun 23 20:20:25 <reclusivemonkey> kidders: gimp is in python?
Jun 23 20:20:26 <kidders> (lol)
Jun 23 20:20:32 * ajmorris_ bookmarks the page to learn python after the meeting
Jun 23 20:20:36 <kidders> reclusivemonkey ... its plugins are
Jun 23 20:20:38 <Jacob> gimp is in C i think... but it has Python extensions
Jun 23 20:20:41 <reclusivemonkey> ah
Jun 23 20:20:51 <Jacob> ugh I hate C and C++
Jun 23 20:20:56 <kidders> hehe
Jun 23 20:21:03 <kidders> they're a necessary evil
Jun 23 20:21:04 <Jacob> C lets you shoot off your foot
Jun 23 20:21:13 <madmetal_spyros> i bookmarked the page to learn python after summer :P
Jun 23 20:21:14 <reclusivemonkey> I know a little HTML/CSS/XML/XSL/VBA/bash scripting
Jun 23 20:21:14 <kidders> i like that in a language!
Jun 23 20:21:22 <Jacob> C++ makes it harder, but if you do manage to it will take off your whole leg
Jun 23 20:21:31 <kidders> roflmao
Jun 23 20:21:39 * kidders ponders
Jun 23 20:21:48 <kidders> ... so that's why i've been finding it so hard to walk lately
Jun 23 20:21:51 <Jacob> lol
Jun 23 20:22:36 <Jacob> ooh... fresh bait in the ua join queue
Jun 23 20:22:47 <kidders> ?

Jun 23 20:23:20 <Jacob> idk
Jun 23 20:23:25 <kidders> let's all be sure to tell the poor soul what Jacob thinks of him, eh?
Jun 23 20:23:26 <kidders> hehe
Jun 23 20:23:28 <Jacob> never really counted :-D
Jun 23 20:23:31 <Jacob> lol
Jun 23 20:23:49 <Jacob> http://ubuntuforums.org/showgroups.php
Jun 23 20:23:58 <Jacob> we're at the bottom, with the exception of ubuntu-geek
Jun 23 20:24:13 <kidders> it's biiiiiig!
Jun 23 20:24:19 <kidders> (our list)
Jun 23 20:24:24 <Jacob> hehe, it is
Jun 23 20:24:29 <Jacob> and one is about to be added
Jun 23 20:25:23 <ajmorris_> 37 +1 for the new person :)
Jun 23 20:25:27 <Jacob> 'ere he is: http://ubuntuforums.org/member.php?u=35362
Jun 23 20:25:41 <kidders> yeeks
Jun 23 20:25:54 <kidders> a bloody cat!
Jun 23 20:25:57 <Jacob> lol
Jun 23 20:25:58 <kidders> hehe
Jun 23 20:26:07 <reclusivemonkey> we should see if we could keep a count of the unanswered posts and see if we can track the %age over time...
Jun 23 20:26:07 * kidders doesn't much care for cats
Jun 23 20:26:29 <Jacob> reclusivemonkey: it's hard to count them though... i think the search caps off at 25 pages
Jun 23 20:26:31 <kidders> reclusivemonkey, the %age that go unanswered?
Jun 23 20:26:51 <kidders> my "unlucky" user finder effectively does that
Jun 23 20:26:51 <kidders> ...
Jun 23 20:26:53 <kidders> sort of
Jun 23 20:26:57 <Jacob> yeah
Jun 23 20:26:58 <reclusivemonkey> Jacob: Ah, that would explain the constant 250!
Jun 23 20:27:01 <Jacob> hehe
Jun 23 20:27:08 <Jacob> was it 250 pages?
Jun 23 20:27:16 <kidders> (interesting idea, reclusivemonkey)
Jun 23 20:27:41 <reclusivemonkey> It would be nice to see it going down =]
Jun 23 20:27:45 <kidders> sure would
Jun 23 20:27:55 <Jacob> yeah
Jun 23 20:28:01 <reclusivemonkey> 250 posts I think...
Jun 23 20:28:02 <kidders> that'd be the *real* measure of our success
Jun 23 20:28:30 <kidders> reclusivemonkey, i'll add a graph of the numbers of unanswered posts to the ua site
Jun 23 20:28:49 <Jacob> yeah 250 results
Jun 23 20:28:50 <reclusivemonkey> kidders: That would be great!
Jun 23 20:29:03 <kidders> :D
Jun 23 20:29:06 <Jacob> the rest of them are thrown into the void of lost searches
Jun 23 20:29:15 <kidders> yeah :(
Jun 23 20:29:17 <Jacob> kidders, awesome
Jun 23 20:29:30 <reclusivemonkey> If we could break it down into unanswered posts per forum / total posts per forum that would be more accurate
Jun 23 20:29:32 <Jacob> (about the graphs, not the posts)
Jun 23 20:29:38 <Jacob> yeah
Jun 23 20:29:40 <kidders> lol
Jun 23 20:29:44 <kidders> yep reclusivemonkey
Jun 23 20:29:59 <kidders> (my gizmo stores enough data locally to do that, i think)
Jun 23 20:29:59 <Jacob> we'll see if we can make u-g forefit the data on that ;)
Jun 23 20:30:18 <Jacob> or if kidders method works anyway
Jun 23 20:30:26 <kidders> i don't mind
Jun 23 20:30:34 <kidders> :P
Jun 23 20:30:46 <reclusivemonkey> kidders seems like the man who can =]
Jun 23 20:30:51 <Jacob> hehe
Jun 23 20:30:52 <kidders> lol not really
Jun 23 20:33:30 <kidders> erm... am i still connected?
Jun 23 20:33:39 <ajmorris_> yep
Jun 23 20:33:45 <reclusivemonkey> ask uab ;-)
Jun 23 20:33:46 <uab> quit rambling, reclusivemonkey
Jun 23 20:33:49 <kidders> hehe kewl... everything went so quiet!
