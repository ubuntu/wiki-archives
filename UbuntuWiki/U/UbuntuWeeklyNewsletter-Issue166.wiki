==== Ubuntu 9.10 released ====

The Ubuntu team is pleased to announce Ubuntu 9.10 Desktop and Server editions, Ubuntu 9.10 Server for Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud (UEC) and Amazon's EC2, and Ubuntu Netbook Remix, continuing Ubuntu's tradition of integrating the latest and greatest open source technologies into a high-quality,
easy-to-use Linux distribution. Read more about the features of Ubuntu 9.10 in the following press releases:

* Desktop edition - http://www.ubuntu.com/news/ubuntu-910
* Server edition - http://www.ubuntu.com/news/ubuntu-910-server-edition

Ubuntu 9.10 will be supported for 18 months on both desktops and servers. Users requiring a longer support lifetime on the server may choose to
continue using Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, with security support until 2013, rather than upgrading to 9.10.

Thanks to the efforts of the global translation community, Ubuntu is available in 25 languages.  For a list of supported languages and detailed
translation statistics for these and other languages, see: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Translations/ReleaseLanguages/9.10

Ubuntu 9.10 includes the first official release of Ubuntu Server images for UEC and for Amazon's EC2, giving you everything you need for rapid
deployment of Ubuntu instances in a cloud computing environment. UEC images, and information on running Ubuntu 9.10 on EC2, are available at: http://uec-images.ubuntu.com/releases/9.10/release

Ubuntu 9.10 is also the basis for new 9.10 releases of Kubuntu, Xubuntu, Edubuntu, UbuntuStudio, and Mythbuntu:

* Kubuntu: http://kubuntu.org/news/9.10-release
* Xubuntu: http://xubuntu.org/news/9.10-release
* Edubuntu: http://edubuntu.org/news/9.10-release
* Mythbuntu: http://mythbuntu.org/9.10/release
* Ubuntu Studio: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuStudio/9.10release_notes

==== Ubuntu Open Week ====

Ubuntu Open Week takes place from the 2nd – 6th November 2009. Open Week is a week of free live online tuition and Q+A sessions that are provided on a range of topics by many of the movers and shakers in out community. If you are interested in getting involved in the Ubuntu community, this is an incredible opportunity to learn many of the skills involved, meet many of our contributors and just have a great time!

The way the sessions work is pretty simple, and everything is explained here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuOpenWeek/JoiningIn You simply join two discussion channels, one in which you watch the session leader deliver a session and the other to ask questions in. This year we even have a web based interface to the sessions, so it is easier than ever to get involved! https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuOpenWeek/JoiningIn

This is an fantastic opportunity to welcome new members to our incredible community, and I would like to encourage everyone to spread the word about Ubuntu Open Week so that the opportunity is open to as many people as possible: do go and blog, tweet, dent and otherwise spread the word!

==== Ubuntu One Blog: File sync status update ====

A few Ubuntu One users have reported a bug (#462828) in the desktop client software that could cause files to become unavailable in some circumstances. As a temporary measure, we have updated our server to display a “Capabilities Mismatch” error to prevent files from becoming unavailable to users. https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntuone-client/+bug/462828

A client software update will be released very soon in the update channel. Manually running Update Manager will update your client to work with the server and fix the root cause. Throughout this period, all files are still available from the Ubuntu One website. http://one.ubuntu.com/files

Contact syncing and tomboy syncing services have not been affected by this issue.

UPDATE: A new client is available now for beta PPA users running 9.04 and 9.10. More updates coming soon. https://launchpad.net/~ubuntuone/+archive/beta

UPDATE: The updated Ubuntu One client software is now available to those running Ubuntu 9.10 and not using the beta PPA. Please run Update Manager to install the new software.

==== Canonical Blog: Landscape 1.4 Adds UEC Support ====

Cloud management dominates the theme for Landscape 1.4 with new features that allow you to manage your private Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud (UEC) as easily as you manage your instances on Amazon EC2. Also released are new features that help system administrators be more efficient including time based package updates and role based access. These new features will be available this week on both the Hosted and Dedicated Server Editions of Landscape.

Cloud Computing: UEC Support

Building upon our support for Amazon’s EC2 Cloud, users can now start, stop and manage their private Ubuntu instances on their UEC from within Landscape. Users simply enter their credentials directly through Landscape to start, stop and manage an instance. We’ve designed Landscape to work directly with both Amazon and Eucalyptus console pages so you can manage your instances without having to use any other tools. Landscape securely stores your security credentials making is easy to spin up new instances on UEC or EC2 at anytime. Once the instances are initiated, they all display on the same page allowing you manage all your physical, virtual and Cloud instances in one place.

New Timed Package Updates

Users can now schedule package updates, system reboots and shutdowns in the future with minute increments. This gives System Administrators the flexibility to schedule activities for systems to occur during planned maintenance windows or low use periods to minimise the impact on the network. Now that we have developed the time / scheduling function, look for us to add this to other areas of Landscape where it it makes sense, like scheduling scripts in the future.

Administrator Roles

As Landscape is deployed in larger enterprises the need to delegate and limit access to systems has become a key need. Now, in addition to having a master admin who can manage all systems within a Landscape account, you can delegate access to systems to other administrators. This builds on our tags function (which allows you to tag computers performing the same function and update them with a single command) to allocate full access to systems by admin. Typically this means system admins in different areas can be given full access to their local systems, but not to those in another area or country. Like tags, assigning systems to other administrators is completely flexible so you can use what ever criteria you need.

The Landscape 1.4 client is available today and is included with Ubuntu 9.10 server edition. Details are at www.canonical.com/landscape

==== Ubuntu-AZ: ABLEconf ====

ABLEconf (Arizona Business and Liberty Experience conference) was held on Saturday, October 24, 2009.  Once again at the University of Advancing Technology in Phoenix, the conference held more presentations than in its inaugural. Among those displaying their services was the Ubuntu-Arizona Lo``Co team.

We were a little disappointed with the conference at first, this year.  Not because my table was bracketed by Red Hat on one side and Fedora on the other. No, it just seemed that there were very few people attending the conference.  All morning long, we only had a handful of people approach the tables.

However, by noon, the whole area around the vendors’ tables seemed to sprout people by the handfuls and in bunches.  Then it hit me.  Everyone had been at the morning presentations.  That’s why we hadn’t seen them.  About 90 people filled the space as PLUG (Phoenix Linux Users Group) leader Hans started up the raffle for prizes.  Sponsors had donated a number of prizes to be given out – everything from books to a USB pen (literally) drive, to a child’s penguin costume, to various food items.  Excitement ran high as Hans had tickets selected and numbers called off, and good natured teasing erupted from all over.

The presentations were well received. Certainly discussions at our table were enlightening both for the people who came to ask questions and for me.  If the questions raised at my table are any indication then people are starting to think of more than just “what’s in it for me.”  They are beginning to ask about how Linux behaves and what is available, as well as differences between distributions.

The talks with the Red Hat representatives was just as enlightening.  We discussed problems we’d had with various elements of our distributions – everything from window managers and sound and graphics to problems raised by others and how we strove to solve them.  It was interesting to find that we all shared similar problems and solutions.  Unlike commercial software vendors, there was no competition between us, or at least only good natured competition.

All in all, a great event for the Lo``Co and Ubuntu!

=== Launchpad News ===

==== Meet Francis Lacoste ====

Francis Lacoste recently started on a six-month stint of running the Canonical Launchpad team. It seemed like a good time to find out a little more about him. The following are questions Fancis answered in his interview:

* How did you get into free software
* What's more important, principle or pragmatism
* Do you, or have you contributed to any free software projects
* Tell us something really cool about Launchpad the not enough people know about
* In the Principia Discordia, Malaclypse the Younger states that all things happen in fives. What five things are coming soon in Launchpad that you’re most excited about?
* Kiko’s special question! You’re at your computer, you reach for your wallet: what are you most likely to be doing?

==== Accessing Git, Subversion and Mercurial from Bazaar ====

bzr-svn, bzr-git and bzr-hg are plugins for bzr that make Subversion, Git and Mercurial branches first class citizens in the Bazaar world by allowing you to access them in the same way that you would access native Bazaar branches.

Bazaar has supported multiple file formats from its early days. Both its model and its implementation allow this:

* Revisions are not identified by the checksum of their layout on disk (as they are in systems like Git or Mercurial) but by a (pseudo-)random string. This means that copying data to a different file format does not affect the revision id.
* Repositories are accessed through a well defined interface. Other parts of the code base are ignorant about the structure of the files on disk.

This has made it easy to introduce better and experimental repository formats without having to break old repositories or render them unusable for previous versions of Bazaar by forcing upgrades. Initially new formats were introduced at a very high pace (perhaps even a too high pace?), but fortunately this has slowed down nowadays: the last default format change before the 2.0 release was in 2007.

Having grown interested in Bazaar through Martin’s talk at Linux.Conf.Au 2005 and his blog posts I started looking into Bazaar in 2005. Since Samba (the main FOSS project I work on) had just switched to Subversion, I was interested in ways to interact with Subversion using Bazaar, in particular so I could do off-line commits. On the Bazaar wiki Aaron had suggested implementing the well defined interface for repository formats for other version control systems (such as Subversion) as well. This sounded very neat, so I decided to see how far I could get and looked into learning Python and becoming more familiar with the Bazaar API.

Now, four years later, 700 bug reports and about 4400 revisions later, we have released bzr-svn 1.0. The models of Subversion and Bazaar have significant differences, and bzr-svn has to take care of mapping between the semantics of both. Perhaps the best example of this is the fact that a Subversion repository is basically a filesystem; there may be some directories that are commonly used as containers for branches or tags, but there are a lot of exceptions to this convention. In Bazaar on the other hand, a branch is a primary object.

In 2006 Rob and Aaron created a simple plugin for accessing local Git repositories in 2006 called bzr-git. Originally it was based on “stgit”, a tool which (among other things) exposed a Python wrapper around the git executables. Following a switch from Samba to Git I took over in 2008 and changed bzr-git to use a new native implementation of Git in Python, based on a project by James. bzr-git now supports accessing remote repositories, working trees and merging changes back into Git.

At the moment I am working on the bzr-hg plugin, again based on an initial proof of concept by Rob. Last month ago the first version (0.1) was released, providing sufficient support for cloning local and remote Mercurial repositories and accessing working trees. There are still some problems to work out — memory usage is excessive, commit and push do not yet work — but there should be a stable plugin in a few months.

==== Commenting on questions ====

If you’re using edge, you can now just comment on a question in Launchpad. For all questions on Answers, the “Just Add a Comment” button is now always visible. Previously, you might have only seen “Add Answer” and “Add Information Request” (or others; the exact buttons vary), both of which add a comment and cause the question status to change. But often, for example, all you want to do is clarify an earlier comment, add some detail, or give a progress update. For that, “Just Add a Comment”.

It’s been put at the rightmost position of all the buttons because we think it should be the least used option. Normally it’s appropriate to use one of the other buttons to move the workflow forward.

The button will land in production with the 3.1.10 release next week.

==== Michael Lustfield: Creating Your Own Bazaar Server ====

By now we've all heard about the Bazaar (bzr) version control system. If you're a coder then you're well aware of what a version control system is and why it's helpful. If you code on Launchpad you're equally aware how incredibly awesome this system is.

Rather than discuss how incredible bazaar is, I'd like to explain how to set up a production level deployment for a bzr server. If you're curious what makes bazaar great, just try it out. You can use https://staging.launchpad.net/ to create branches for playing around.

To deploy a low level and basic setup you only need to run this command on your server:
sudo aptitude install openssh-server bzr

That's really all there is to it. You can now push an existing code branch to your server using the following command:
bzr push ssh+bzr://yourserver.com/~/branch

That's only a basic deployment. What I like doing is having branches where multiple people can work on the same branch. This first thing I do is create a directory that this whole thing will be based in. I like to do this on its own partition for obvious reasons. For me this always exists at /bazaar. I then use the following: Please visit the link below for the rest of the instructions necessary to complete your bazaar server.

==== Running Ubuntu 9.10 With Older PC Hardware ====

Phoronix's Michael Larabel tells us that for the most part, Ubuntu 9.10 offers better performance over its predecessor, but in his testing there were a few performance drops in different areas. With that in mind he looked at how Ubuntu 9.10 is running with older PC hardware. Larabel determined that Ubuntu 9.10 offers a number of new features to Linux desktop and server users along with other core improvements to this incredibly popular Linux distribution. In a number of our tests today with an older Think``Pad notebook, Ubuntu 9.10 also provided the best performance when compared to earlier Ubuntu releases from the past 18 months. http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=ubuntu_karmic_old&num=1

==== Ubuntu 9.10 "Karmic Koala" Officially Released ====

Michael Larabel of Phoronix reports that just as planned, Ubuntu 9.10 "Karmic Koala" has been officially released on October 29th. Additionally, 9.10 Karmic releases of Kubuntu, Xubuntu, Edubuntu, Mythbuntu, and Ubuntu Studio are also available. The Ubuntu 9.10 Server build also sports support for the Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud (UEC) and Amazon EC2 support. Furthermore, another flavor of Ubuntu 9.10 that is also available is Ubuntu 9.10 Netbook Remix with its many improvements. The Ubuntu 9.10 release notes are available and there is also a graphical overview. Download Ubuntu 9.10 and the other members of the Karmic Koala family from Ubuntu.com. http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=NzY1MQ

==== Ubuntu 9.10 'Karmic Koala' released, could decide your OS fate ====

Engadget's Thomas Ricker says it's October 2009 which means something very special for Linux fans: a 9.10 release of Ubuntu. On October 29th we see the launch of "Karmic Koala" featuring a faster graphical boot sequence (no more scary text scrolls), a revamped audio framework that improves sound control across multiple applications, and a new Software Center that visually simplifies the Add/Remove Applications tool. These are just a few of the user-centric improvements meant to have a "transformative effect" on the OS experience and help bring "the world of open source closer to the user." It's available in desktop, server, and netbook editions now so get to it, before you know it you'll be updating to Lucid Lynx. http://www.engadget.com/2009/10/29/ubuntu-9-10-karmic-koala-launching-today-could-decide-your-fu/

==== Ubuntu Linux 9.10 'Karmic Koala' Starts Its Climb ====

Sean Michael Kerner of Internet``News.com recalls that in February, Ubuntu Linux founder Mark Shuttleworth announced that Ubuntu 9.10 would be codenamed the "Karmic Koala". On October 29th, after months of development and buzz, the Karmic Koala was officially released into the wild. The first thing that new users are likely to notice about the Karmic release is the speedier boot process. "The boot process is now substantially faster in Karmic than it has been in any previous Ubuntu release," Shuttleworth said in a conference call with the media earlier this week. "We have a goal to get to a 10-second boot, and Karmic is a nice step in that direction." http://www.internetnews.com/software/article.php/3846141

==== Ubuntu Linux 9.10 (Karmic Koala) ====

Desktop Linux Reviews' Jim Lynch tells us that since the launch of Desktop Linux Reviews, he has covered a number of different remastered versions of Ubuntu Linux. But he hasn’t done a review of Ubuntu itself. He is happy to note that Ubuntu Linux has hit version 9.10 and has some nifty new features that make it worth reviewing here. Ubuntu Linux 9.10 is well worth upgrading to if you’re running an earlier version of Ubuntu. There’s some great new desktop features in this release as well as some new stuff that isn’t readily apparent on the surface. Lynch enthusiastically recommend Ubuntu Linux 9.10 for beginners as well as more experienced Linux users. It remains one of the best desktop Linux distributions around and it’s the basis for so many fun remasters. In Lynch's opinion, It’s definitely worth a download. http://desktoplinuxreviews.com/2009/10/26/ubuntu-linux-9-10-karmic-koala/

==== My Thoughts on Ubuntu 9.10 ====

Ed Hewitt, Blogger, Gamer and Columnist, Ubuntu Games, for Full Circle Magazine takes a moment to share his thoughts on Ubuntu 9.10, Karmic Koala.  Ed has been using Karmic since the Beta was released and now takes a moment to reflect on the newest addition to Ubuntu.  Ed believes that Karmic is the best release to date!  He attributes this components to making this happen: Ubuntu Hundred Paper Cuts Project, new look of the User Interface, and the Linux Kernel that shipped with 9.10.  In his article Ed goes into much more detail about all 3 of these components.  Ed also talks about some new features and applications with Karmic as well as the Firefox advancements.  He concludes with praises for Ubuntu 9.10 and is looking forward to "further improvements and polish"

==== Centrify: Ubuntu Server Edition 9.10 Meets Active Directory ====

Joe Panettieri, workswithU, discusses the significance of ISV's such as Centrify offering support of the Ubuntu Server.  When Ubuntu 9.10 was launched on the 29th of October, Certify (maker of Microsoft Active Directory, related tools) vowed support of the Ubuntu Server Edition 9.10.  Joe points out that though this may be a small step in gaining a "foothold" in the Windows Corporate networks it is still significant step. In this post Joe goes on to tell why this is important and what he would like to see other ISV (Independent Software Vendors) do in support of future Ubuntu Service Releases.  Especially the next release (Ubuntu 10.4, Lucid Lynx, Server Edition) as it will be a Long Term Supported (LTS) Release. Though Joe is careful to state he hasn't tested Centrify he does show his excitement and support for ISV's willing to support the Ubuntu 9.10 and future Server Editions. http://www.workswithu.com/2009/10/29/centrify-ubuntu-server-edition-910-meets-active-directory/

==== Ubuntu 9.10: confidence riding high at Canonical ====

Sam Varghese, iTWire, discusses the confidence, assertiveness, and cleverness at Canonical, the Corporate sponsor of the Ubuntu Project.  In this article Sam discusses the release of Karmic as "the best of all its releases".  He also discusses the Ship``It announcement, in which Canonical COO, Jane Silber announced changes and scaling back of the program.  Sam cites this is an indicator of Ubuntu being ready for "primetime". Sam also talks about the careful naming of each release and what the names say about the state and goals of each Ubuntu release.  Sam reminds us not to forget about the marketing of Ubuntu through IBM or what effect Microsoft announcing the release of documentation of Outlook Personal Folders will do for Ubuntu.  Sam discusses where the Ubuntu Project was in 2004 and where and why there is no place to go but up.  Read about these things and more in this insightful iTWire story by Sam Varghese. http://www.itwire.com/content/view/28830/1090/

==== Ubuntu 9.10: Linux for business ====

Steven J. Vaughan-Nicols, Computerworld Blogger, notes that with the release of Ubuntu 9.10, Karmic Koala, that Ubuntu means business, with a growing emphasis on the server market.  Steven, points out that there is no doubt that Ubuntu 9.10 is a great desktop distro, but it is clear that Canonical is serious about having (making) the Ubuntu 9.10 Server known in the enterprise market.  Steven, points to a conversation he recently had with Steve George, Canonical, Dir. of Support and Services, that "Canonical saw it's Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) compatible UEC (Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud) as being perhaps Ubuntu 9.10's most important feature"  No matter where you want to run your server Ubuntu has something for you.  Wanna look into the the future of Enterprise Servers - Look into Ubuntu 9.10 (and beyond) Server Edition and see what solutions Canonical can offer you through the Ubuntu Server and cloud computing.  Steven does a great job explaining it and provides links to help the reader figure out what is best. So take a look and see what giant step Ubuntu is taking for the business model. http://blogs.computerworld.com/14999/ubuntu_9_10_linux_for_business

==== Ubuntu 9.10 is the Appetizer; Ubuntu 10.04 is the Meal ====

Joe Panettieri, of Works With U, isn't ready to say that Ubuntu 9.10 is the "default alternative to Windows."  It's his opinion that Ubuntu 10.04, being a Long Term Support (LTS) release will be the one that counts, especially on servers and in the cloud.  He is hearing that "Canonical’s server and partner teams already have their eyes on Ubuntu 10.04 (Lucid Lynx), a Long Term Support (LTS) release expected in April 2010."  But time will tell, as corporate deployments of Ubuntu result in revenue flowing to Canonical.  See his review at the link.

==== Yes, Ubuntu can absolutely be the default Windows alternative ====

Christopher Dawson, writing on ZDNet's News and Blogs section, talks about all the places that Ubuntu is advancing and Windows is not: for example, the mobile and ARM platforms and the cloud.  He acknowledges that many feel that Windows 7 is the best Windows yet, but the reason is because of the competition generated by Ubuntu and others in the FLOSS community.  And competition is the word, as Ubuntu is available on MID, netbook, kiosk, phone, virtualization and smartbook.  See his comments at the link.

==== ZaReason Bolsters Ubuntu 9.10 Branding ====

Joe Panettieri, of Works With U, notes that Za``Reason is offering a stick of Ubuntu case badges with purchase of a new computer between October 29 and November 5.  Za``Reason already puts the logo on keyboards and case badges on netbooks, notebooks, laptops and servers.  Now, they're going beyond that, at least temporarily.  The reason?  Brand recognition.  His comments can be seen at the link.
