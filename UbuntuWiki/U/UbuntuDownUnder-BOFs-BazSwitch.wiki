=== Introduction ===

In an effort to get more people using Baz, start a BazSwitch campaign.

This should initially target existing arch users, rapidly followed by users of other revision control systems (RCS's).  The goal is to make it as easy as possible for users to switch for Baz from their existing RCS's.

=== Rationale ===

With Bazaar and Bazaar-NG in active development, we want to encourage the general Free Software community to embrace the Bazaar concept/development model.  Creating a vibrant community around Bazaar and Bazaar-NG will benefit both applications greatly, in various ways:
** developers contributing features, fixes, and ideas,
** additional third party applications utilizing or based upon Baz,
** advanced users providing support to new users,
** and user advocacy growing the Baz community.

=== Scope and Use Cases ===

N/A

=== Implementation Plan ===
 
** Set up a planet site for developers in the Baz community.  Planet fits a nice niche between a low-traffic announce list, and a high traffic development list.  It's a great place to learn about new hacks and features from the people who are implementing or using them.

** Focused tutorials for all major RCS's, to ease conversion to Baz.  This should be short and sweet; the goal is to get people up and running with Baz as quickly as possible.

** Testimonials from companies and users, especially famous ones.  This will focus on companies, as getting companies to adopt Baz will add different use cases and feature requests.

** Publicize the supermirror and Launchpad.  Users who switch should find that they can just branch off mainline of their favorite project without the hassle of tracking mainline, importing, etc.

** Work with distributors (Debian, RedHat, etc) to ensure installation of Baz is as simple as possible.  For example, 'apt-get install baz' (instead of bazaar) should do the right thing on Debian, Connectiva, Mandrake, etc.

** Provide binary packages or explicit instructions for installation on non-Linux distributors and legacy platforms.

** Update webpage to focus on the Baz-specific IRC channels, mailing lists, and other resources.

** Provide pointers and tutorials to third party plugins and UI applications (`OctoPy`, `Nautilus` plugin, etc) that improve the Baz user experience.  Encourage authors of cool projects to support Baz (IDEs, graphical interfaces, etc).

** Try replacing the current webpage with a Moin wiki that appears the same, but encourages community updates/input.

** "Googlization"; get Baz found via Google when people search for things like "revision control".  If we can't get domains like bazaar.org, we should attempt to get bazaar.canonical.com as one of the first hits when Googling for things like 'baz', 'bazaar', and so on.

** Media coverage:
** Developer interviews.  Increase the visibility of the project for people who wouldn't otherwise be interested.  Print and online articles should be a primary target. 
** Press releases.
** Publish benchmarks and comparisons against others RCS's, once we have optimized Baz to blow away the competition.  Encouraging widespread adoption of Baz will require a sensible UI, and the benefits over other RCS's.  Speed should be emphasized for large projects. 
** Prepare "lightning talk" and tutorial templates for Baz presentations at conferences.  Encouraging existing Baz users to give talks about how to successfully use Baz will provide a focused word-of-mouth buzz.
** Encourage advocacy at conferences.
** Create banners and t-shirts, with a Baz or BazSwitch logo.  Possible logo: <<BR>>
