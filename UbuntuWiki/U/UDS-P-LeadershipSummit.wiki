== Leadership Mini Summit Ideas ==

At UDS we will be running our first ever mini-leadership summit. The goal of the event is to provide an opportunity to block off some time to discuss leadership topics and help empower our leadership and governance community to feel empowered to lead in our community.

=== When ===

The leadership summit will take place over two afternoons at UDS in Orlando, Florida. These afternoons are yet to be finalized.

The summit is open to all, and Jono Bacon has reached out to leaders to propose topics for the sessions. Remote participants are welcome to join in the sessions too.

=== Ideas ===

At the beginning of the leadership summit we will review the ideas list below and prioritize which topics are of most interest and then flesh out the time in leadership summit afternoons to discuss the most interesting topics.

Please add your topics below (if you add a topic, you should be willing to attend and help run the session -- feel free to add your name to an existing topic if you are happy to coordinate it too):
