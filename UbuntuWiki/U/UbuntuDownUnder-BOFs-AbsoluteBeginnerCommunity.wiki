=== Introduction ===

Ubuntu can do a better job of catering to 'Absolute Beginners', folks who could be new to Linux, might previously have used Windows or Mac
OSX or might even be completely new to computers.

=== Rationale ===

This BOF aims to help us cater better to our absolute beginner
community. Absolute beginners come in several forms:

* Beginners to computers
* Beginners to Linux in general
* Beginners to Ubuntu

We need to do a better job structuring the early user experience to
better identify and serve each group and to retain those users over
time.

=== Scope and Use Cases ===

The BOF aims to discuss the following issues and problems:

* Experts can't conceive that users don't yet understand the basics and no single support and documentation option fits all groups.

* There are different types of newbies. Different group should be catered to differently and separately.

Most users are currently pointed to http://www.ubuntu.com for support,
to the default welcome page in Firefox in the install CD and in the
Live CD or to the GNOME Yelp dialog is the other major area.

=== Implementation Plan ===

We should concentrate in three areas identified as the major contact
points for new users:

* The Ubuntu home page at http://www.ubuntu.com
* The default local start page in Firefox on the Live and Installed versions
* The GNOME Yelp Help dialog

Each of these places should have more information for new users and
should cater to the different groups of users separately (even if they share
some information) rather than expecting users to find the right
information for their level of expertise.

We should write text useful for people new to Ubuntu. In some form,
this information should be:

* Linked from the homepage with a clearly visible link

* Visible on the Firefox start page on default Ubuntu installations.

* At the top of the Yelp dialog (as the first or one of the most visible item).

Then first choice users should face after identifying themselves as a
new user is to ask users to identify themselves into one of the three
categories of users that we have defined and then provide them with
appropriate information.

==== Users Who Are New To Computers ====

Task oriented guidelines - probably the Quick Guide although we can
add additional resources or modify the existing quick guide to better
serve this role.

Support options for new users that include:

* Local Community Teams

* Relevant forums (pending the creation of an beginner forum)

* Any other relevant documentation that we can identify as useful for this type of beginner.

* Link to events like Software Freedom Day that can connect newbies with people willing to help

==== Users Who Are Familiar with Proprietary Operating Systems ====

We should create a document that introduces Mac OSX and Windows users
to Ubuntu and summarizes the way the applications in the different
OSes map to each other -- or don't -- and points out key differences.

NOTE: We can refer to the wiki pages made by Tim: <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/WhatWindowsUsersWant|WhatWindowsUsersWant]]</nowiki>.

The Quick Guide can also be linked here.

We should also point out important and relevant support options that
include:

* Local Community Teams

* Relevant forums and mailing lists

* The standard Ubuntu support page

* The Ubuntu IRC Channel

==== User Who Are Familiar with Other GNU/Linux OSs ====

We should point users who are already familiar with GNU/Linux systems
to documentation for individual applications and to the Ubuntu User
Guide.

We should also point them to the complete list of Ubuntu support
options.

==== Summary ====

Other ideas voiced in the BOF include adding functionality to call
online help for any context where users are working (probably
an issue for upstream).

We should also look at web statistics and other information to
identify the distribution of users among these groups to help focus
our efforts more effectively in the future.

Other ideas largely outside the scope of this BOF but mentioned
include pursuing OEM deals to get Ubuntu pre-installed (installation
being the most difficult stage for most users).

=== Outstanding Issues ===

* Ask Ryan Troy to create a forum for absolute beginners. (UPDATE: 5/9/2005 Absolute Beginner Guide added to the forums)

* We should also go through and identify documentation that exists and that can be classified into the group we've identified above.
