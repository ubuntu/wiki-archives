==== Ubuntu Developer Summit - Ubuntu 10.10 - Maverick Meerkat planned ====

Ubuntu developers and contributors from all over the globe meet in Brussels, Belgium from May 10th through May 14th, 2010 to plan the next Ubuntu release - code named Maverick Meerkat, currently scheduled to be released in October 2010.

UDS opened with the "We're not going to take it" video introduction to Maverick Meerkat [1].  The video was made using Ubuntu and open source applications by Robbie Williamson of the Ubuntu Platform team.

While the Ubuntu Technical Board has not yet approved the 10.10.10 release date, there is already talk of the Oct 10th date being the goal to shoot for. Mark Shuttleworth in his UDS Keynote [2] explained why this date would be an important date to aggressively plan for.  In this same keynote the mystery of why the buttons were moved to the left in lucid was solved as "Unity" and "Ubuntu Light" and "Windacators" were explained.

Many who attended UDS in Brussels noted that even though the tracks were the almost same as past UDS'. There seemed to be even more sessions available to choose from than in the past. The following break out illustrates why those who attended felt that way.

Sessions per track at UDS-M:

* Cloud and Server - 53

* Community -  72

* Design - 20

* Desktop - 116

* Foundations - 33

* Kernel - 27

* QA -  35

* Security - 17

* Ubuntu on Arm - 47

The Canonical Kernel Team choose 2.6.35 to be the Ubuntu 10.10 kernel version as well btrfs as a technology preview.

The popularity and demand for the ARM sessions surprised everyone to include Mark Shuttleworth and before the end of the first day at UDS the ARM sessions had to be moved to rooms that held 60+ people.  Even after moving these sessions to larger rooms they were still at standing room only capacity.

The Ubuntu 10.10 cycle will focus on how to encourage new developers and to sharpen the skills of those developers who are currently contributing to Ubuntu. The 'opportunistic' developer will play a key, and crucial role in this cycle.

UDS also focused on better communications, better marketing, increasing community participation, increasing quality and quantity of testing as well as increasing participation in all *ubuntu weeks, and updating wiki.ubuntu.com pages for all teams.  There are also plans for updating ubuntu.com/community pages to better serve those who are looking to find ways to contribute to the Ubuntu project. That's not all, the community pages aren't the only area getting a face lift, The Fridge, Ubuntu Weekly Newsletter, Ubuntu Wiki Pages, Ubuntu Forums, Ubuntu.com and Canonical.com will be updated to reflect the new light theme.

Several people who attended UDS in person and remotely did a great job or summing up the sessions they attended. Please take a moment to read about their thoughts on UDS.

==== Unity, and Ubuntu Light ====

Mark Shuttleworth discusses Unity and Ubuntu Light on his blog post:

A few months ago we took on the challenge of building a version of Ubuntu for the dual-boot, instant-on market. We wanted to be surfing the web in under 10 seconds, and give people a fantastic web experience. We also wanted it to be possible to upgrade from that limited usage model to a full desktop.

The fruit of that R&D is both a new desktop experience codebase, called Unity, and a range of Light versions of Ubuntu, both netbook and desktop, that are optimised for dual-boot scenarios.

The dual-boot, web-focused use case is sufficiently different from general-purpose desktop usage to warrant a fresh look at the way the desktop is configured. We spent quite a bit of time analyzing screenshots of a couple of hundred different desktop configurations from the current Ubuntu and Kubuntu user base, to see what people used most. We also identified the things that are NOT needed in lightweight dual-boot instant-on offerings. That provided us both with a list of things to focus on and make rich, and a list of things we could leave out.

Instant-on products are generally used in a stateless fashion. These are “get me to the web asap” environments, with no need of heavy local file management. If there is content there, it would be best to think of it as “cloud like” and synchronize it with the local Windows environment, with cloud services and other devices. They are also not environments where people would naturally expect to use a wide range of applications: the web is the key, and there may be a few complementary capabilities like media playback, messaging, games, and the ability to connect to local devices like printers and cameras and pluggable media.

We also learned something interesting from users. It’s not about how fast you appear to boot. It’s about how fast you actually deliver a working web browser and Internet connection. It’s about how fast you have a running system that is responsive to the needs of the user.

Mark also discusses the following in his post:

* Unity: a lightweight netbook interface

* Ubuntu Light

* Evolving Unity for Ubuntu Netbook Edition 10.10

* Relationship to Gnome Shell

* Relationship to Free``Desktop and KDE

It will be an intense cycle, if we want to get all of these pieces in line. But we think it’s achievable: the new launcher, the new panel, the new implementation of the global menu and an array of indicators. Things have accelerated greatly during Lucid so if we continue at this pace, it should all come together. Here’s to a great summer of code.

==== A Case for Modifying the Ubuntu Release Schedule ====

Robbie Williamson,  Ubuntu Platform Team Manager writes on his Blog about the modified release schedule needed to hit the proposed 10.10.10 release schedule for Maverick Meerkat on his blog.  Robbie presented this information on the last day of UDS.

There has recently been some discussion on the Ubuntu Tech Board mailing list around releasing Ubuntu 10.10 on 10/10/10 and the impact on Ubuntu’s promise to release on a regular six month cadence.  In my thinking around this, I decided to take a deeper look at the schedule of past releases…to see how close to a cadence we actually are.  Interestingly enough, I found that while the releases were in the same month (and towards the end), the amount of development and bug fix time varied greatly.

Robbie through a series of slides breaks them (the releases) into equal 26 week cycles, and by the end of the slide show shows - "yes we can!" make the 10.10.10 release date a reality.

==== New Default Applications In Ubuntu Netbook Edition 10.10? ====

After a discussion @ UDS-m, the blueprint for UNE default app selection was updated seconds ago and it now points out that some default applications might be changed in Ubuntu Netbook Edition 10.10.

The first on the list is Chromium, which might replace Firefox as the default browser. The blueprint says this will happen if there is enough space for Chromium and it will be used as the default application until Alpha 3 - and then it will be decided if UNE will switch to Chromium by default or not.

The blueprint also indicates a lot of issues with Chromium which might be in the way of it becoming the default browser in Ubuntu Netbook Edition 10.10 Maverick Meerkat:

==== Steve Conklin: Ubuntu Hams - Our First UDS Session was Great ====

Steve Conklin, Ubuntu Kernel Team writes:

The Ubuntu Hams team was started a year ago, and has seen a lot of membership growth since then. We just finished the first BOF session we’ve ever had at an Ubuntu Developer’s Summit, and it was a lot of fun. As soon as I can I’ll email a summary to the team mailing list. The discussion was wide-ranging, from enabling translation of amateur radio packages, to increasing the number of upstream maintainers that we engage with.

We decided to begin having monthly meetings on IRC for Ubuntu-hams, as well as starting to have some HF nets. If you’re interested in following this, join the team and subscribe to the mailing list. We’ll be having followup discussions there.

==== Jorge Castro: Clarifications around Ubuntu using “Google Chrome” ====

Jorge Castro, Ubuntu Community Team, takes a moment to clarify some things about default applications and Chromium.

* Chrome and Chromium are not the same thing. Chrome is a non-free build of the Chromium project.

* It is impossible for us to ship Google Chrome as a default web browser without compromising our beliefs [1]. You can read more about our licensing and how that relates here [2].

* However we have a section in the software center where people can opt-in to have things like Skype, Adobe Reader, and possibly Google Chrome.

* The distribution models of Chromium and Ubuntu/Debian couldn’t be more different, but since Evan Martin from upstream Chromium attended the Ubuntu Development Summit we have begun to identify how we can make this work. Expect more progress here in the future.

* The switch to Chromium has only been identified as possible choice on the Ubuntu Netbook Edition.

* WE LOVE FIREFOX. Mozilla is one of our most important upstreams and we will continue to work with them as we have in the past.  Improving Chromium in Ubuntu helps Firefox because they both believe that competition is the best way to drive the web forward. For example we use CouchDB as our default for “sqlless databases”, but work (or plan to work) with MongoDB and Cassandra as well. We ship and integrate puppet by default but that doesn’t stop us from making sure Chef is well supported. No sane operating system vendor would want to artificially limit what developers can do on their platform.

* We should be celebrating the choice of excellent browsers pushing the web.

Jorge states, "I hope that clears things up, you’ll be hearing more updates in the usual development channels from the Desktop team as the cycle progresses."

==== Daniel T. Chen: UDS-Maverick recap ====

Daniel Chen takes a moment to recap UDS-M and pass the torch to those who will be carrying on the awesome work Daniel has done on the audio front in Ubuntu and Linux as a whole. Here's what Daniel had to say:

UDS-M is bittersweet. It is the last summit I attend due to additional work commitments that will remove me from Ubuntu development, but more significantly it is the first summit where the future gardeners, maintainers, and developers of the audio infrastructure in Ubuntu and derivatives gathered and discussed how we can drive user experience improvements. In fact, the phenomenal Amber Graner asked me a few questions to that end [1], and a few things that I neglected to mention are that:

* Canonical has some real rock stars ramping up enablement and proactive quirking efforts on the ALSA front, so Linux distributions will see significant improvement in vendor support for audio in the 12.04 LTS time frame;

* we might see a streamlined method of switching between Pulse``Audio and JACK via indicator-sound on the Ubuntu desktop;

* Maverick will see the complete removal of native OSS support from our linux packages with OSS proxy being used instead.

As always, we'll continue to apply stable release updates to supported releases (particularly the most current LTS), to address high profile bug reports against the audio stack, and to maintain helpful presences on the varied mailing lists.

It has been one heck of a five-year ride. Thanks for all the fish [2].

==== Scott James Remnant: BTRFS By Default In Maverick? ====

UDS is over! And in the customary wrap-up I stood up and told the audience what the Foundations team have been discussing all week. One of the items is almost certainly going to get a little bit of publicity.

We are going to be doing the work to have btrfs as an installation option, and we have not ruled out making it the default.

I do stress the emphasis of that statement, a number of things would have to be true for us to take that decision:

1. btrfs would need to not be marked “experimental” in the kernel config; we understand that this is planned for 2.6.35, which is the kernel version we are expecting to ship in Maverick.

2. btrfs is not currently supported by GRUB2 (our boot loader) or the installer; these pieces would need to be finished before Feature Freeze.

3. If that happens, we may make it the default for Alpha releases to gain testing; that testing must go smoothly.

4. The btrfs upstream must be happy with the idea.

5. We must be happy with the idea.

It’s a tough gauntlet, and it would only made with the knowledge that production servers and desktops can be run on Lucid as a fully supported version of Ubuntu at the same time.  I’d give it a 1-in-5 chance.

==== Matthew Helmke: Testing Ubuntu Releases ====

Do you like it when your operating system “just works?” I do. This does not happen easily or without hard work. Ubuntu has a wonderful QA team that has a systematic method of testing releases on diverse hardware platforms. However, they don’t own every piece of equipment out there. This doesn’t have to be the end of the story. Anyone who is willing to do a little bit of work and follow some very clearly outlined procedures may become a part of the team and help make releases better. Interested? Take a look at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing for ways that community members can join the Testing Team and http://qa.ubuntu.com/ for information on the QA Team. These two groups work together toward the common goal of making Ubuntu releases the best they can be through finding bugs, reporting them, and helping find problems on an even wider set of hardware.

==== Lucas Nussbaum: Receive Ubuntu bugs by mail with the Debian PTS ====

It is now possible to subscribe to Ubuntu bugmail for the packages you care about, without having to use Launchpad (and subscribe on a per-package basis there). This is implemented as a new opt-in Package Tracking System keyword: derivatives-bugs.
To subscribe for all your packages, use keyword [email] + derivatives-bugs (as documented in the Developers Reference). You might also want to subscribe to derivatives (Ubuntu diff, etc. also opt-in).

Of course, if other derivative distributions are interested in providing such data, don’t hesitate to contact me or the Debian QA team.
Also, if you are like me and never remember about subscribing to packages you maintain, you can use that UDD script to check for missing subscriptions.

==== Hands-on with Ubuntu's new Unity netbook shell ====

Ryan Paul of ARS Technica reports that during a keynote at the Ubuntu Developer Summit in Belgium, Ubuntu founder Mark Shuttleworth unveiled a new lightweight user interface shell called Unity. The new shell is designed to use screen space more efficiently and consume fewer system resources than a conventional desktop environment. It will be a key component of the Ubuntu Netbook Edition and a new instant-on computing platform called Ubuntu Light. The Unity environment eschews the conventional GNOME panel configuration. It includes a dock-like launcher and task management panel that is displayed vertically along the left-hand side. The top panel will house application indicators, window indicators, and the menubar of the active window. Moving the menu out of individual windows and into a global menu bar will reduce wasted vertical screen space, leaving more room for content. ARS Technica's test of the Unity prototype leads them to believe that the project has considerable potential and could bring a lot of value to the Ubuntu Netbook Edition. Its unique visual style melds beautifully with Ubuntu's new default theme and its underlying interaction model seems compelling and well-suited for small screens.

==== Ubuntu headed to tablets, STBs and embedded car platforms ====

Expect more Linux-based touchscreen tablets, mobile devices and set-top boxes over the next couple of years, as Canonical prepare to push touch functionality in their Ubuntu distribution.  According to director of business development Chris Kenyon, the OS manufacturer is targeting ”the digital home or something you carry around” – though not smartphones – with new builds that prioritise finger-friendly UIs and stripped down packages that boot quickly and offer speedy access to core mobility functionality.

==== Ubuntu Learns New Tricks, Forgets Some Old Ones ====

Ubuntu's latest Lucid Lynx upgrade gave the distro a needed facelift and endowed it with a speed boost as well. Users may find the new music store attractive, and social network butterflies can pipe friends' updates directly into the OS. However, Lucid Lynx has annoyingly changed the placement of crucial buttons, and some users may be miffed by the exclusion of certain programs like GIMP in the default installation. It is evident that the community did a huge amount of work to make it a polished OS. This release stands out! It runs quite deep in user experience. Much of the social networking is more integrated, making it sexy to use.

==== Ubuntu developing new Unity UI, instant-on versions for netbook ====

Canonical is making fast progress on a promise to improve the netbook experience by launching a new user interface dubbed “Unity” and plans for light editions of Ubuntu. An early development codebase of Unity is available now for early testing and experimentation. Unity is optimized for the web services experience and will offer a “dash” interface, instant-on and touch capabilities. One chief goal is to maximize speed — which is defined as getting users to the Internet, and to cloud services pronto, as opposed to the typical fast boot-up metric everyone focused on.

==== With Ubuntu 10.10 It May Be Easier To Run Wayland ====

Phoronix's Michael Larabel thinks that beyond working towards the X Server not running as the root user and the X.Org/Mesa/Kernel upgrades planned for Ubuntu 10.10, it may also be easier to test the Wayland Display Server in this Ubuntu "Maverick Meerkat" update due out in October. Larabel first talked about Wayland in late 2008 when the project was still in its infancy by Kristian Høgsberg. Wayland is still very much a side-project of Kristian's that just receives commits every once in a while and has yet to gain any widespread adoption, but it still possesses a lot of progress. Wayland can run dual nested X.Org Servers within it, now runs off Mesa rather than Eagle EGL, supports the KMS page-flipping ioctl, a DRI2 driver is being worked on, and much more. However, it doesn't do too much yet for the end-user, but that should change once the GTK, Qt, or Clutter tool-kits are properly supported within Wayland. We'll see where Wayland gets by the time Ubuntu 10.10 is due out in October.

==== Microblogging and More with Gwibber ====

Joe Brockmeier, Linux Magazine, takes time to look at Gwibber.  Tired of slogging through Facebook’s interface? Sick of seeing the Fail Whale? Cut through the cruft and simplify your social services with Gwibber — a microblogging client for Linux that supports Identi.ca, Facebook, Twitter, and more.

Joe notes, "It’s easy to get sucked into using social media, but hard to keep up when you start using two, three, or more social media sites. Looking to untangle the Web? Try out Gwibber, a microblogging client that supports a bucketload of social media services."

In his article he discusses the following:

* Getting Started with Gwibber

* Gwibber Displaying Search for Ubuntu

* Multiple Streams in Gwibber

* What Gwibber is Missing

Joe concludes with, "Gwibber development has moved pretty fast. It’s grown up a lot in the last year, and I suspect that trend will continue. It is very easy to use, stable, and If you’re looking for a desktop microblogging client, you should give Gwibber a spin."

==== Ubuntu open to greater touch ====

You'll want to touch Ubuntu in personal places - like in your kitchen or in your car. At least that's what Canonical hopes, as it works on architectural changes and business deals to put the Linux distro on more embedded systems. But smartphones, the industry's current fixation, are out of the picture. Canonical is looking at Ubuntu for in-car systems, tablets, set-top-boxes, and what director of business development Chris Kenyon called "the digital home or something you carry around. We're not thinking about the phone base." The focus of all this is Ubuntu Core - Ubuntu Linux minus the familiar interface. Keynon expects support for other architectures and variants of ARM to grow during the next 12 months. "In 10.10 [due in October], you will see a big push that will make Ubuntu Core a fantastic platform," Kenyon promised.

==== 'Linux is Not User Friendly' - No Way! ====

The mainstream media is adopting Linux, and a lot of people are starting to complain how not-user-friendly Linux really is. one thing they all need to consider is this, Linux!=Windows! It is not the friendliness factor, it is the user familiarity factor that is giving Linux a bad name. Until 4 years ago this blogger was not much of a computer user. He installed Ubuntu on a dual boot and loved it right off. But it took him about 3 months to really get comfortable with the system. There lies the rub, most folks think Linux should be just like windows, and that perception has to change. People have to give Ubuntu and Linux a chance to show them that there is a better way.

==== Philippines use Ubuntu-based voting machines in recent election ====

Last weeks election in the Philippines was notable for several reasons – not least of which was the introduction of a new electronic voting system in which Ubuntu has played a vital – but invisible – role managing the Linux-based ROMs that do the actual counting. Sadly the introduction of computerized vote counting was marred by repeated machine hardware failures, and large-scale errors. Ubuntu in this situation was neither the culprit or the cause, but demonstrated once again the versatile deployment capabilities of Ubuntu.

==== UDS-M: Sound menu Changes coming In Ubuntu Maverick ====

Ubuntu 10.10 will see the introduction of a ‘unified sound menu’, designed to allow users to easily control music playback and control over-all sound volume; staking itself on more than just managing volume, but managing applications that use the sound menu. The menu will act as a “remote control” for Rhythmbox  allowing users to change track, start playlists and display artwork, although it allows for any music player to use it. VoIP applications will also see themselves well served by the new menu with handy sliders for Microphone/input volume and automated fade in/fade out of music upon receiving a call.

==== Too many Ubuntu's? ====

Ubuntu is an excellent Linux distribution. The latest version, Ubuntu 10.04, is great. It's also obvious why there are several Linux distributions based on Ubuntu, such as Kubuntu. But do we really need two new Ubuntu desktops, Unity and Light? Can Canonical do everything that it's already doing while adding more work to its load? Unity, is designed to get the most good out of a netbook's limited screen real estate. This is not just a matter of dumping and/or shrinking down icons. It's an interesting take on what to do with the netbook interface, and it shows that Canonical has been thinking hard about what needs, and what doesn't need, to be on a netbook screen. Canonical has been working on the Ubuntu Netbook Edition since 2008, Ubuntu Light is a new project. This is Canonical's first take on an instant-on, dual-boot Linux.

The Light interface is based on Unity, but the underlying Linux has been optimized to work both in dual-boot situations — but what is most interesting, "it comes with tools for Windows which assist in the management of the dual-boot experience." Gerry Carr, Canonical's head of platform marketing, says that "the business plan is to get OEMs to pre-install Ubuntu on notebooks and desktops so that "Users can access the web in under ten seconds." Just how thinly Canonical can spread itself?

==== The Ubuntu Support and Learning Center ====

The Ubuntu Manual Project is always looking for ways to make their content and material available to as many people as possible. They make it available in different languages and downloadable in different formats, as well as offering the printed version for purchase through an online publisher. The next logical step is an online HTML version of the content. The Ubuntu Support and Learning Center (USLC) will be an awesome, quality, dynamic website that acts as an online learning and support center for Ubuntu users to both solve their problems or work through tasks, and also to learn more about Ubuntu and how to contribute to it. The final site would involve material from the manual project, docs team, learning project and third party articles, split into well organized, topic based help using cutting edge web technologies like HTML5 and Javascript. The website would also collect information and feedback from the users. USLC will be developed over the next 6 months and will be available for Maverick.

==== UDS-M: Me Menu getting improvements for Maverick ====

The Me Menu in Ubuntu 10.04 is getting much needed improvements for Ubuntu 10.10 based on user feedback and research. Some new features and bug fixes planned from the UDS session:

* Notifications to confirm that your broadcast message has been sent
* A label for the text field to make it more obvious what it does
* Character counter for the text field
* Faster synchronization with Gwibber updating new information
* A better word instead of "Broadcast" for the Broadcast accounts option
* Buttons to select which accounts you would like to post the message to as per the original design

==== Advanced Configuration pop-up messages (notify-osd) ====

Thanks to Lucid``Fox [1] for pointing to Roman Sukochev blog [2] where he writes about configuring the notify-osd pop-up messages. Since notify-osd in Ubuntu Meerkat is being dropped, a patch that allows you to change under a color pop-up messages, and text options, indents, etc seemed to be a good idea. Instructions describe how to implement the patch, how to use it, and it also specifies the repository where you can install the already patched package notify-osd, without the need to build it manually. Please visit the translated page below to get the full instructions.

==== Canonical’s Ubuntu support scope ====

What software will Canonical provide support for? That’s probably one of the questions you might be asking yourself. Generally speaking for an application to be supported as part of a service subscription it has to be within the Main repository. This is because applications within the Main repository receive public maintenance (bug fixes and security updates) for the life-cycle of the release. In order for an application to move into Main it goes through a stringent security and quality assurance assessment. As part of this review Canonical’s engineers inspect the code and ensure that they are able to maintain it. The second issue is how do you know which software is covered within the Ubuntu service that you subscribed to? Some Linux distributions deal with this by covering all the software that they physically ship to customers. However, in Ubuntu’s case most users receive the software electronically so this doesn’t work. Consequently, when a customer purchases a particular service subscription they receive a Service Description. This describes the scope of support, the bug-fixing coverage, the legal indemnification, the software components covered and the response levels.

http://slgeorge.wordpress.com/2010/05/14/canonicals-ubuntu-support-scope/

==== Commercial bug-fixes for Ubuntu ====

If you have a commercial subscription service for Ubuntu how do we prioritize fixing bugs? For business users Ubuntu’s advantage is often flexibility. Nonetheless, it’s hardly “free” if you can’t use the software. And Ubuntu, like all software, has bugs and issues – particularly when you’re using it in a complex environment. To resolve these issues professional users need access to expertise when there’s an issue. In the proprietary world the license agreement commonly includes support so the customer presents the bug and they should get a resolution. A service agreement means that the customers bugs are guaranteed a response, that the issue will be dealt with by an Ubuntu expert and that the issue will be prioritized. For Canonical engineers customer bugs are prioritized over general development work and are split into categories by urgency. Initially when the customer presents the case the GSS (Global Support & Services) team triage it and where possible come up with an immediate workaround. So flexibility is the Ubuntu advantage, and the advantage of working with Canonical is there’s a canonical resource for Ubuntu expertise.

==== Ubuntu Lucid Lynx on Arm ====

What a fantastic release Ubuntu 10.04, aka Lucid Lynx is. Now that UDS is over, it's a good time to look back at what happened to the ARM version of Lucid this cycle. Here are some of the changes.

* New User Interface
* Faster Live CD Boots
* Web Office & Web Mail integration
* Optimized Tool Chain defaults
* Concentration on bug fixing
* Chromium browser now works on ARM
* Root``stock gui
* beagle board support
* and lots of minor improvements

Canonical is very proud of the Lucid Lynx on ARM, and are extremely excited at what future releases will bring.

==== OggCamp10 – veni, vidi, vici ====

Ogg``Camp in Liverpool has finished up, and it looks like many in the Ubuntu Community had a great time. Tony Whitmore, Alan Pope, and Laura Czajkowski were just a few of the participants. A lot of productive work got done, but there was a lot of fun behind the scenes and after hours at the event. By the end, everyone was worn out. Tony is busy reflecting on the event and says he is looking forward to next year already, even though he'll probably have to organize the event again. Sounds like a love - hate - love relationship. Read all the high points of the event at the link below.

==== GNOME Marketing Hackfest Spring 2010 ====

Jason D. Clinton, discusses the ends and outs of GNOME Marketing Hackfest 2010. We got so much done marketing work done last week in Zaragoza, Aragón, Spain. The city was beautiful and I'm more energized and optimistic about the GNOME 3.0 launch than ever before!

By the time that the hackfest began, we knew a lot more about what will be in GNOME 3.0 than we did 6 months ago. Additionally, Vincent Untz, of the release team, was able to give us a much more informed view than we've had before. Taken together, we were able to nail down the major features we are going to talk about to the public: the improved user experience (GNOME Shell + search), topic-based help, performance improvements, improved art (symbolic icons) and a new theme, all the great GNOME apps we have now plus great new applications (the details that the release team will decide and then release in the coming weeks).

We hammered out, as a large group, the timeline of actions needed to be taken by the marketing team. The list is huge and there's plenty of room for more help! If you're a non-coder, this is one of the many ways to get involved in GNOME. The entire 3.0 launch roadmap is posted here [1].

All in all, it was hugely productive and a great time, too. GNOME 3.0 is going to rock!

==== F-Spot 0.6.2 Released! ====

Ruben Vermeersch, F-Spot 0.6.2 released.

After a long period of silence, it is my pleasure to announce that a new version of F-Spot has been release: 0.6.2. Notable changes in this release are:

* We no longer embed Mono.Addins. The distribution copy should be used from now on.
* A ton of bugfixes and usability improvements, part of them coming from the Ubuntu One Hundred Papercuts effort. Many thanks for everyone involved!
* Lots of cleanups and small performance improvements.
* The screensaver code has been migrated from old and slow to new and fast.
* A stop-gap fix for the long standing issue of timestamps being changed on import. The default policy is now to not touch them. This should lead to the least confusion among the majority of our users. If desired, additional techniques can be developed for those who want it otherwise.
* A pile of translation updates.
* As of this release, we're switching to a versioning scheme where even version numbers denote stable versions and uneven versions denoting development versions. There's also a stable branch which can be tracked. More info on this will come in a separate email.
* 573 files changed, 81197 insertions(+), 85122 deletions(-)
