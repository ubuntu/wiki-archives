=== Other Community News ===

==== Ubuntu Kylin is a beautiful Linux operating system optimized for Chinese users ====

Jack Wallen in writing about Ubuntu Kylin provides us a list of apps that are included by default. We're told it includes a unique app store geared for Chinese users; thus Jack resorted to installing some wanted apps from the terminal. Jack notes that whilst Ubuntu Kylin is optimized for Chinese users, it was easy to switch to English at install (telling us how), though he notes some 'bits' still remained in Chinese. Finally a discussion is given on why you'd want to use Ubuntu Kylin.
