=== General Community News ===

==== New domain names for PPAs ====

Colin Watson reminds us of the history of Launchpad's PPAs, and the issues with cookies & HTTPS. This leads to a brief history of security decisions made, and to a "dilemma" which is being resolved by the addition of a ppa.launchpadcontent.net domain that supports HTTP and HTTPS. We are told Ubuntu 22.04 LTS will use this new address, but are also advised the older address will continue working using HTTP only. This is also a warning that some proxies will require change.

==== Call for testing: preliminary 20.04.4 release candidate images ready! ====

Lukasz Zemczak on behalf of the Ubuntu Foundations Team reports the release of the first official release candidate of Ubuntu 20.04.4; noting that some OEM kernel work is being done so new ISOs may be required for desktop releases. We are invited to help test; links are provided so the test can be recorded, and we can track the progress on this release.
