==== Ubuntu Tamil Team ====

Tiruppur, Nov 22nd. The Textile Town of Tamil``Nadu, India - Tiruppur[1] witnessed the Ubuntu Intrepid Ibex release in a demonstration given by its IT Association - TITA[2]. Members of Tiruppur IT Association demonstrated Ubuntu Intrepid Ibex, and its various features including Tamil Language support, Multimedia Capabilities, Office Suites, Package Management techniques, Wine, etc.

The Ubuntu Tamil Team proposed, that a one day Monthly Training program on Ubuntu, be organized for people who purchase computers through the Association Members. This should motivate people to switch over to Free Software with confidence. Sri Ramadoss and Siva from the Ubuntu Tamil Team conducted the event. The secoond day of the event explored the Ubuntu Server capabilities for the TITA members. More demand were made on the Server segment.

It was a memorable event, and the team wishes to thank the Tiruppur IT Association for providing the team with this opportunity. Special thanks also to Mr. Ravichadran, President of IT association, Mr. Babu, Mr. Thiyagu, Mr. Senthil, and others for their backing and helping with this event.

==== Tunisia Team ====

The Tunisian Team held an install party and conference on November 15th at the Multimedia and Computer Science Institute of Sfax, Tunisia. Held in conjunction with the local cell of the Tunisian Association Young and Sciences, they started the day with a booth of about 10 laptops powered by Ubuntu, Ubuntu``Studio, and Ubuntu Muslim Edition. They distributed about 40 CDs, burned iso images, and did some USB installations. The team also made 2 presentations, one to introduce FOSS and Ubuntu, and the other to talk about Ubuntu``Studio.  http://rafiiik.blogspot.com/2008/11/ubuntu-install-party-et-confrences.html

==== Ubuntu-Netherlands release party ====

The Netherlands Team held a release party in Groningen, and it was quite successful according to Herman Bos. The team had about 50 people stay through the whole program. Herman felt that the size of the party was good, and that a good time was had by all in attendance. Two talks were given during the party, too.

==== Launchpad 2.1.11 and Open ID support ====

Launchpad 2.1.11 has just been released, and includes  two major features.  First, Open``ID, that lets you access many different websites, such as Source``Forge, Blogger, Live``Journal and thousands of others,just got better. Second is the ability to contact other Launchpad users when their email address is hidden.  By using the new "Contact this user/team" link you can email up to three users/teams per day.

=== Ubuntu Forums News ===

==== RSS Feeds for Ubuntuforums ====

bapoumba has a solution for those looking for RSS feeds of the Ubuntuforums. The dedicated page for the feeds was lost in the last big upgrade of the Ubuntuforums software. It may come back, but in the meantime here is a work-around. By clicking on a sub-forum thread in the Ubuntuforums front page and looking at the address bar, you will see a number at the very end.  This is the forum-id number. So, for example, the URL for Absolute Beginner's Talk (ABT) would be http://ubuntuforums.org/external.php?forumids=326. The one for the complete forums RSS would be http://ubuntuforums.org/external.php.

=== In The Press ===

* Local hero: Stefan Lesicnik on Linux and Ubuntu - South African web site Tectonic interviewed Stefan Lesicnik on various aspects of how he got involved with Linux and Ubuntu. Stefan points out that Ubuntu contributing developers, are contributors to Ubuntu that do so on a more technical level. Ubuntu contributors typically handle more complicated tasks such as merging new packages from Debian, debugging software, or packaging software from scratch. Stefan has been working with the security team, and part of his responsibilities will be to merge security fixes from vendors or the community, into supported versions of Ubuntu. Stefan was this week confirmed as an Ubuntu contributing developer. http://www.tectonic.co.za/?p=3692

* Ubuntu vs. Open``Solaris vs. FreeBSD Benchmarks - Over the past few weeks Phoronix has been providing several in-depth articles looking at the performance of Ubuntu Linux. They first compared Ubuntu 7.04 to 8.10 benchmarks, then Mac OS X 10.5 vs. Ubuntu 8.10 benchmarks, and in this article they compared the 64-bit performance of Ubuntu 8.10 against the latest test releases of Open``Solaris 2008.11 and FreeBSD 7.1. The tests included LAME MP3 encoding, 7-Zip Compression, Gzip compression, GnuPG, BYTE Unix Benchmark, Tandem XML, Bork File Encryption, Java Sci``Mark, Bonnie++, OpenSSL, and Sunflow Rendering System. The Phoronix Test Suite, which is Phoronix's advanced GPLv3 testing software that is compatible with Linux, BSD, Open``Solaris, and Mac OS X platforms, powered all of these tests. In the end if simply counting which operating system was in first place most frequently, it would be Ubuntu. Ubuntu 8.10 x86_64 was in first place eight times, Open``Solaris 2008.11 RC2 was in first place seven times, and FreeBSD 7.1 Beta 2 AMD64 was in first just three tests. http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=os_threeway_2008&num=8

* Fedora 10 vs. Ubuntu 8.10 Benchmarks - With the Fedora 10 release earlier this week, Phoronix performed benchmarks comparing the performance of Ubuntu 8.10, and Fedora 10. In their testing they used both the 32-bit and 64-bit builds of each distribution, and then ran a series of automated tests through their Phoronix Test Suite. After testing both the x86 and x86_64 editions, performances were nearly identical. In fact, the results were so close that it was hard to call a winner. There were a few slight deviations in tests like the timed Gzip compression and BYTE Unix Benchmark, but nothing conclusive on the hardware configuration Phoronix used, or the real-world tests conducted. http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=ubuntu_810_vs_fedora_10&num=6

* First Jaunty Jackalope (Ubuntu 9.04) alpha hops into view - Ubuntu developers have announced the availability of Ubuntu 9.04 alpha 1, the first pre-release version. Ubuntu 9.04, codenamed Jaunty Jackalope, is scheduled for official release in April. In addition to the ongoing long-term usability enhancement efforts, Canonical and the Ubuntu development community, are focusing on several specific technical goals for 9.04. Some of these improvements include performance, boot time, and integrating web services more tightly with the desktop. Ubuntu 9.04 alpha 1 is available for download from the Ubuntu web site, although only the server CD image and the text-based "alternate" CD image were built for the alpha release. The next major alpha release is scheduled for December 18th, shortly after the Ubuntu Developers Summit(UDS). The final Debian package import freeze for 9.04 will be on Christmas day. Additional pre-releases will follow until the final release arrives on April 23rd. http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20081124-first-jaunty-jackalope-ubuntu-9-04-alpha-hops-into-view.html

=== In The Blogosphere ===

* When Ubuntu Breaks, Who’s to Blame? - Blogger Christopher Tozzi tells us that as a regular participant in support threads on ubuntuforums.org, he's exposed frequently to people who might be fairly characterized as ‘dissatisfied customers’ of the Ubuntu experience. Something doesn’t work as well as it’s supposed to—no out-of-the-box wireless or dual-monitor support are two of the most popular complaints—and these new users condemn Ubuntu and Linux in their entirety as a result. But are these charges justified, and how should Ubuntu respond? Canonical has to assume responsibility for shortcomings in software beyond its control. Microsoft and Apple may not have to answer for the problems of third-party applications, but if Ubuntu really aspires to become a Linux for the masses, its developers and community members need to understand the point-of-view of ordinary users and stop placing blame elsewhere, even when it does rightly lie elsewhere. Accepting blame for someone else’s faults is neither pleasant nor fair. But it’s a reality that Ubuntu has to accept if it truly aspires to bring desktop Linux to the masses. http://www.workswithu.com/2008/11/22/when-ubuntu-breaks-whos-to-blame/

* More Ubuntu Kung Fu - Keir Thomas, author of the new book Ubuntu Kung Fu, stopped by lifehacker to share some of the best material from his book. Tips in this article include how to optimize startup for faster boot times, running boot-time scripts in parallel, building a read-ahead profile personalized to your computer, and trimming the gnome startup programs. Keir also explains network time protocol, getting more data onto CD-R discs through over-burning, and installing all the multimedia playback codecs you’ll ever need. You'll learn how to get better dvd movie playback, create zip files using maximum compression, and how to get a high-quality (and free) command-line word processor with Microsoft word. Top it all off by learning how to add drop shadows to screenshots, stop the cursor from blinking, how to play MP3/OGG files at the command line, and adding RAR file compression support to Ubuntu. http://lifehacker.com/5098369/more-ubuntu-kung-fu

* Xavier School Deploys 600 Ubuntu Linux Desktops - Joe Panettieri of Works``With``U reports that Xavier School in San Juan, Philippines has deployed more than 600 Ubuntu desktops. The switch from Windows was brought about due to a budget issue based on Microsoft's base licenses and subscription licenses.  Ubuntu was chosen because of its ease of use as a desktop, and because of the availability of Edubuntu. http://www.workswithu.com/2008/11/25/xavier-school-deploys-600-ubuntu-linux-desktops/

* Ported entire live disk build process to be livecd-rootfs friendly
* Canceled alternate disk builds

==== Training Team ====

* Our primary project is updating the Ubutnu Desktop Course materials from 7.10 to the 8.04 LTS version. Many contributors have reviewed the existing material and suggested edits. To see the status of our progress, see the Getting Involved section of the wiki. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Training/GettingInvolved
* The Training Team is now holding weekly mentoring sessions. These sessions cover using the tools (Docbook editing via OO.org v. 3, Bzr and Launchpad)to help update the Ubuntu Desktop Course. Sessions are held every Wednesday in #ubuntu-training at 20:00 UTC. Starting next year we hope to add North America evening times as there have been several requests for this.

* Meeting 10-11-18:
** South Africa Team reviewed and reapproved.
** Discussed encouraging Lo``Cos to do their Team Reports. Decided that the Lo``Co Council will not make an official push, but will see if the News Teams publicity of the Team Reports has any impact.
** The idea of Lo``Cos having their IRC meetings in #ubuntu-meeting was discussed. The reasoning involved making Lo``Co members feel part of the greater Ubuntu community, not just their Lo``Co. It was deemed unnecessary since it would cause major scheduling headaches and require Lo``Co members to join a separate channel just for a meeting.

==== Danish Team ====

Yet another nice month for the danish team, and a range of great projects has been planned for the next couple of months.

General:
* The 8.10 Release Party was the biggest event for the danish team yet. Feedback has been great, and they feel it was a success. Planning has started for the next one or two release parties.
* Appeared in National TV (DR1) equivalent to English BBC in a 20 min. long show about Ubuntu and Open Source.
* Increased the average daily visitor number on the Lo``Co site by a stunning 71% in 2 months due to heavy marketing campaign. A similar increase in the registered forum user number has been counted.
* A good general increase in the number of active members and participants in the Lo``Co team.

Projects:
* A new project has been started to redesign/plan out website, from the bottom up. A LP group has been created to the project.
* A danish Ubuntu Podcast is being planned.
* More focus has been put on marketing for Ubuntu in Denmark, both for private and governmental institutions. Discussions about distribution Ubuntu CDs from public libraries and the likes, together with home-made flyers has been taken, and the flyers are being worked out.

==== German Team(Berlin) ====

* The team had a fantastic release party. http://daniel.holba.ch/blog/?p=269
** Translation of the officially unofficial party report as posted on the ubuntu-berlin mailing list: The "Ubuntu Berlin" user group successfully accomplished the 6th release party in Berlin on November 1st to celebrate the latest Ubuntu version "Intrepid Ibex". For the fourth time the party took place at the Berlin culture project "c-base e.V." establishing a fine tradition. Once again around 150-200 people took part in the celebration during the night. The agenda consisted of 6 presentations about new features in Ubuntu, the network manager, an initiative for free wireless networks "Freifunk", the semantic Desktop Deep``a``Mehta, tips and tricks for newbies, KDE 4 and of course personal support and demonstrations on the demo computers. To prepare the party the media agency Area42 kindly sponsored 1000 leaflets that were dispersed all over the town, and for the second time the Berlin subway TV "Berliner Fenster" promoted the Ubuntu release and the party to thousands of travellers. Some high profile blogs like netzpolitik.org as well as the popular radiostation "Radio Fritz" made a good point about the event in their news coverage. Amongst the supporting musical program covering a variety of tastes and styles were DJ High``Energy with live electronic music and the rockband "Hankyfour", while booths for Ubuntu brownies, Ubuntu apparel and Ubuntu origami contributed to the rich variety of activities. As before dozens of still warm [k|x]ubuntu CD's were spread amongst the party people... Our special thanks goes out to Area42, Berlin subway TV "Berliner Fenster", ubuntu Deutschland e.V., c-base e.V. and all volunteers taking part in the preparation and wrap-up of the party.
* Workshop held on 2008-11-20: working with Ubuntu - users show their applications for the daily work (organized as an open talk). There were about 20 people in the audience. More infos in german language at http://www.ubuntu-berlin.de/node/90.
