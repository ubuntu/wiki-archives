__TOC__

I'd just like to let everyone know that another Apple iBook G3 (turquoise clamshell) has been revived.  I've just installed Ubuntu 5.04 and am loving it!  One problem that made things difficult is that the cdrom is not very sensitive and so wouldn't read the installer cds that I had tried to burn.  To remedy this problem, I set my burner at a low write speed (4x).  The cd created at this speed worked perfectly upon reboot.
