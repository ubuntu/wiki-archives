Profile: Amateur tester of Feisty amd64 builds...

My main motives for struggling:

a) To learn linux and propagate the ideals of FOSS

b) To get the most out of the hardware I buy with my own sweat and blood

c) To be someday soon (before April that is) able to enjoy HD definition audio from my P5B-VM motherboard.

My present goal is getting stable bit-perfect spdif output from the Analog Devices AD1988 chipset (24bit/192KHz), Dolby Digital etc. I managed once to achieve it with feisty and since then I try to reproduce the awesome sound I got.

I believe in the "no sense running 32 bit apps on 64 bit harware" motto.

I will try to help in my spare time debugging the issues involved, help the other testers and hopefully some time I will be able to provide tips and support for audiophile applications for Feisty x64.

CURRENT PROGRESS of x64 Feisty Desktop daily-live testing

==========================================================  ==

March 18. I am still stuck at bug #84964 and the livecd won't boot. Waiting for the beta next week, hoping this will be fixed.
