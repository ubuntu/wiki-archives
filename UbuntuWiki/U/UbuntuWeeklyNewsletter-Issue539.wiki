=== In Other News ===

==== Mark Shuttleworth’s next mission: making private clouds affordable ====

Martin Veitch relates his interview with Mark Shuttleworth giving a brief biography and a history of Mark's rise as CEO of Canonical. In the phone conversation the point of reference is the analysis by 451 Research, that leads to utilize cloud assets in a private cloud sector for IoT. The result is a plan for Canonical to manage the infrastructure of private clouds, but the execution is done in the private domain (ie. your own servers). As Canonical surpasses competition in IoT, Martin speculates that there may be an IPO as soon as next year. If private cloud is successful, Marin remarks another "change in the way the world makes IT work".
