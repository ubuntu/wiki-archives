=== General Community News ===

==== And We're Back ====

The Ubuntu News Team hopes everyone had a wonderful holiday season and that 2012 is starting out to be great.

Issue 247 will be a little longer than past issue as we try to bring you the highlights from the holidays.

Thanks for your continued support and we are looking forward to bringing all of you the Ubuntu Weekly Newsletter throughout 2012.

==== Ubuntu 12.04 Development update ====

Daniel Holbach shares some of the latest news in Ubuntu 12.04 development, including creating working daily builds, QA work on automatic ISO and upgrade testing as well as the reduction in number of uninstallable packages. Holbach also reports: "publisher (the machinery that makes packages available once they are built in Launchpad) can be run every 30 minutes" shortening the amount of time between uploading a fix and testing.

The spotlight of the development update is on “Fixing Ubuntu bugs – how you can be part of every step along the way” where the process flow is described consists of test, file bugs, investigate the bug, forward upstream, pick up the fix, integrate the fix and propose for upload.

The update wraps up with basics for how to get involved, find something to work on and get in touch with the development team.

http://fridge.ubuntu.com/2011/12/22/ubuntu-12-04-development-update-9/

==== New IRC Council ====

The Community Council announces and congratulates the following new IRC Council (IRCC) Members:

* Ben Rubin | Pici | https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BenjaminRubin
* Juha Siltala | topyli | https://wiki.ubuntu.com/JuhaSiltala
* Alan Bell | Alan``Bell | https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AlanBell
* Matt Wheeler | Funkyhat | https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MattWheeler

And sends thanks to the former members of the IRCC for their work.

==== Precise Quality, not just for Precise ====

Mark Shuttleworth discusses the path forward with the development of 12.04 as he describes the three legs of the Ubuntu engineering practice: cadence, quality and design. He discusses the Quality Assurance (QA) tools and processes now being employed to not only help quality on the Ubuntu side, but which will also work with upstreams that have test suites.

==== #lubuntu call for operators ====

The IRCC is now taking applications for a number of new operator positions in the #lubuntu channel. Requirements and core expectations are outlined and instructions for applying are provided.

==== Canonical at CES, Las Vegas, 10th – 13th January to showcase Ubuntu TV ====

Canonical has announced its participation in the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas from January 10-13. "On display will be the latest in Desktop, Cloud and demonstrations on Ubuntu One, plus an exclusive Ubuntu concept design which will be announced during the show."

In a later post Canonical revealed that the concept design would be an Ubuntu TV. They have launched a new site at http://www.ubuntu.com/tv with details.

=== Community Acknowledgments and Success Stories ===

==== Thanking the Ubuntu community ====

Marek Bardoński wrote up a summary of Ubuntu Community Appreciation Day and adds some thoughts of this own:

“We are in Christmas period. Everyone reassembles wishes and try to appreciate others.

It is the perfect time to thank the people, by which we can enjoy a free operating system - Ubuntu, and in a broader perspective - the whole Open Source community. Consider how computer world would look without free software:

* Microsoft would have a monopoly for a long time, because no single company is not able to create the competition for him, resulting in much higher price of Windows
* All tools and programs designed to study or work would be paid (except for not fully functional demo version), so that the development of science and art will grow in a much slower rate
* The presence of monopoly would jeopardize the security, because a group of one thousand people from around the world is able to react much faster than even Microsoft's security team, consisting not more than twenty people

These are only some aspects, which is worth noting. Exactly one month ago, on 20.11.2011, we held the first Community Appreciation Day Ubuntu, a day in which users would like to thank developers for their work. For my part, I would like to thank all the Ubuntu developers and wish further successful development. I put a few links showing gratitude from the community:

Let us remember this day, I encourage everyone to create entries and thank Ubuntu contributors, especially in this day in the next year - 20/11/2012.”

==== Thanks to the Open Source Community ====

Scott Sanbar discusses some of his recent successes and the open source tools he’s currently using. He then goes on to thank the Ubuntu Beginners Team and notes he seeks to increase his involvement in, Ubuntu and the Open Source Community in general.

Graber writes about the following areas: Bonding, Tagging, Bridging, Complex Network Configuration Example, and IPv6.

In his conclusion he states, “At this point, I think Ubuntu Precise is pretty much ready as far as networking is concerned. The only remaining change is the new ifupdown and the small installer change that comes with it for DHCPv6 support.”
