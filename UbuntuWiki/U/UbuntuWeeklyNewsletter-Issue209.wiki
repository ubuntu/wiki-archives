==== Farewell Ian ====

Canonical remembers Ian Clatworthy:

Our friend and colleague Ian Clatworthy passed peacefully away on the 31st of August, after a long, difficult struggle with cancer. Ian was very excited to join Canonical in early 2007, and he made large contributions to Bazaar, including launching and driving the bzr-explorer project. Ian's unique enthusiasm, insight, drive, courage and sense of humour continue to be an inspiration to us.

==== Ubuntu 10.10 Beta (Maverick Meerkat) Released ====

The Ubuntu team is pleased to announce the release of Ubuntu 10.10 beta.

Codenamed “Maverick Meerkat”, 10.10 continues Ubuntu’s proud tradition of integrating the latest and greatest open source technologies into a high-quality, easy-to-use Linux distribution.

Ubuntu 10.10 Desktop Edition and Ubuntu 10.10 Netbook Edition continue the trend of ever-faster boot speeds, with improved startup times and a smoother, streamlined boot experience.

Ubuntu 10.10 Server Edition provides even better integration of the Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud, with its install time cloud setup.

Ubuntu 10.10 Server for UEC and EC2 brings the power and stability of the Ubuntu Server Edition to cloud computing, whether you’re using Amazon EC2 or your own Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud.

The Ubuntu 10.10 family of Kubuntu, Xubuntu, Edubuntu, Ubuntu Studio, and Mythbuntu, also reach beta status today.

The announcement covers what's new the following areas as well:

* Ubuntu Desktop features

* Ubuntu Server features

* Ubuntu Netbook features

* Kubuntu features

* Xubuntu features

* Edubuntu features

* Ubuntu Studio features

* Mythbuntu features

* Other

 There is also a section  - About Ubuntu and links to how you can -  Get Ubuntu 10.10 Beta

For more information on Ubuntu 10.10 Beta, how you can get it as well as a list of mirrors closest to you go to:

==== Xubuntu Winning Artwork ====

Charlie Kravetz announces - AND THE WINNER IS …

I want to thank all the artists that submitted artwork for Xubuntu Maverick Meerkat, soon to become Xubuntu 10.10. We certainly got some great images from you. The artwork was selected by vote of the Xubuntu Team after some discussion. The actual wallpaper is now in Maverick Meerkat.

All of the submitted art is on display at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xubuntu/Artwork/Maverick. The winning wallpaper is Xubuntu 10.10 / Balls/Curve. We also selected the GTK Theme that was submitted, Zuki Blues.

The Shimmer Project team did the final polishing of the theme for Xubuntu, including the Elementary Icon set. The final package is called Bluebird, and is really good. With the addition of Bluebird, Xubuntu has both an excellent dark theme, named Albatross, and an excellent light theme, called Bluebird. Albatross will remain a working, usable theme in Xubuntu.

Back to the title, the real winner here is all the Xubuntu users, who will once again have great artwork in the new release. With the addition of Bluebird, users have a real choice between light and dark. Again, many thanks to those who did submit art and to the Shimmer Project (http://shimmerproject.org/) for their fantastic work.

==== New Ubuntu Lucid Proposed Kernel ====

Steve Conklin, Canonical Kernel Engineer, announced on September 1, 2010 that a new Ubuntu Lucid proposed kernel was available.  The Ubuntu kernel team has prepared a new proposed kernel for Lucid (2.6.32-25.43), containing a large number of fixes. This is a larger number of updates than we would usually push at one time, but processing of the upstream stable updates was delayed by a couple of security updates.

This kernel should fix a lot of issues, including this one that people have been asking about a lot.
You will get this automatically if you have updates from lucid-proposed enabled. Note that if it breaks you get to keep all the pieces,  so don’t try this on production machines.
Please test against your favorite bugs in the changelog and provide feedback.

==== Announcing Ubuntu App Developer Week! ====

It’s that time again! Ubuntu App Developer Week (Formally Ubuntu Opportunistic Developer Week), is happening online between September 27th through October 1st, 2010.

“What is Ubuntu App Developer Week?”

Ubuntu App Developer Week is a week of sessions aimed at enabling and inspiring developers to write applications that scratch their itches. Our goal is to give all attendees a taste of the wide variety of tools on the Ubuntu platform that can be used to create awesome applications, and to showcase some applications that have been created and explain how they were put together.

“When is Ubuntu App Developer Week?”

Ubuntu App Developer Week is scheduled for Monday, September 27th through Friday, October 1st, 2010.

“Where will Ubuntu App Developer Week take place?”

Ubuntu App Developer Week will take place in #ubuntu-classroom and #ubuntu-classroom-chat on freenode.net.

Still undecided? Here is how Jono Bacon, Ubuntu Community Manager described this event last cycle:

The week will be just like our previous online learning events such as Ubuntu Developer Week and Ubuntu Open Week, but instead providing a week jam packed with awesome sessions about writing applications that scratch your itch, and predominantly focusing on Python tools and frameworks, Bazaar, Launchpad and infrastructure. The goal for the week is give attendees a head start on a given technology useful for applications.

Like the other weeks this cycle, Lernid is being used and all session leaders are being encouraged to create slides for their sessions . As each session is confirmed it will appear in Lernid and on the wiki page.

Just like the other Ubuntu Weeks we are looking for volunteers! So what are you waiting for? If you feel you could give a tutorial about a given Python module or associated technology (e.g. Glade, Launchpad, Bazaar etc), please drop Jono or myself an email at jono AT ubuntu DOT com or akgraner AT ubuntu DOT com and we will work with you to get everything scheduled.

Thanks in advance to all you session leaders that I know are waiting to volunteer. We’re looking forward to another awesome Ubuntu Week and seeing what itches get scratched during this Ubuntu App Developer Week!

For more information on how you can participate (we still need sessions and session leaders) go to:

==== Why do you use Ubuntu? ====

Alejandra Obregon, Canonical Design Blog - We’ve been looking at making developments to the Ubuntu website that explore and highlight the reasons for using Ubuntu above and beyond the features of the products. One idea we had was to invite community members and Ubuntu users to tweet or post about why they use Ubuntu and display this on the site. The community’s voice on the website would demonstrate one of the key drivers for using Ubuntu: showing the strength and commitment of the community, not just telling visitors about it.  Adding the voice and personality of the community to the websites will enable members and users to participate in our site’s messaging and to share their passion for the concept and principles on which Ubuntu is based.

More can be found here: <nowiki>[[http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23iuseubuntubecause | #iloveubuntubecause]]</nowiki>

Please post your own and raise awareness so we can get a broader response.

Have you got any other ideas for how we can bring this to the fore on our websites?

==== First Kernel Triage Summit ====

Jeremy Foshee, Ubuntu Kernel Bug Triager, announced the First Kernel Triage Summit.  On Saturday September 11th the

Kernel Team will take the first in what I hope to be a series of steps toward educating ourselves and our community in the triage of the thousands of bugs that pass our way daily.

My goal for this event is to begin the process of training those interested in helping with kernel bugs in the way we process our bug tickets. This first event is meant to help us both educate and document. The information on the first ever Triage Summit is located on the wiki here.

As with everything we do, your feedback is appreciated. Please don’t hesitate to send us e-mail to the team list at kernel-team@lists.ubuntu.com or even on the wiki page itself. Your feedback will go a long way toward our plans for future events like this.

To find out more information and what topics are being covered go to:

==== Ubuntu in Education ====

Wow – I’ve already been amazed at learning about some of the great things happening with Ubuntu in Education.  At every level, Ubuntu in schools and learning just makes sense.  Yesterday I was pointed to this great map showing school deployments in Finland:  http://bit.ly/amFiOO .   Greece is right behind them and lots of schools in the US are reporting success using Ubuntu as well.  The work is being done by both volunteers and Solution Providers.

The Andalusia deployment of over 200,000 systems is well documented and Amtron deploying 28,000 in Assam in northern India and Oxford Archaeology and Johns Hopikins and Oakland University and the list continues to grow.  Next week I’m visiting a local school in my backyard of Houston, TX that has migrated to Ubuntu using Moodle and other open source SIS (Student Information Systems).  The project lead is also the volunteer coordinator of the Moodle Core Contrib team.   I had to travel out of town to meet him and learn about this great project.  I’m really glad I did!

Next up, the Edubuntu team is still being driven by the unstoppable Jonathan Carter (highvoltage) and everyone is welcome to stop into #edubuntu and join the weekly meetings on Tuesdays to add your voice.

=== LoCo News ===

==== LoCo Team Banners for Approved Teams ====

Following on from my post  last week regarding the up to date conference packs and the new banners for APPROVED teams, we have created a new wiki page we need the team contact to fill in. Again, a big thank you goes to Canonical for making this possible!

The wiki pages lists the teams at present who are approved  at present, please do not add any more teams in there without consulting the Lo``Co Council.  Team contacts need to update the wiki AND mail shipit with the relevant information on the wiki page. The banners are not ready as of yet but will be soon, and we need to have this information at hand when we have them in stock.   Remember when updating the wiki to check if someone else is editing it to avoid wiki conflicts!

For more information go to:

http://www.lczajkowski.com/?p=898

==== LoCo Testing Team HowTo ====

Paolo Sammicheli gives an update to the Italian Lo``Co Teams ISO Testing experience - I finally completed the wiki page about the Italian experience in ISO Testing: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/LoCoTeam I would really love if other Lo``Cos would like to start ISO TESTING contributing in making Ubuntu everyday better.  I also ask you to continue improving that page sharing your experiences as well.

==== Ubuntu 10.10 Installfests ====

We are looking forward to the release of the next version of Ubuntu, version 10.10 the Maverick Meerkat. As we should in theory have access to the final iso images slightly before the release date, we have an opportunity to run installfests during the day of release. Where ever you are, feel free to use this poster design based on an awesome Meerkat photo.  So if you want to use this you can check out the svg source and the bitmap image on Ubuntu with:  bzr branch lp:~alanbell/+junk/installfest. Feel free to edit it using Inkscape, change the time, date, Lo``Co logo and print it. You will need the Ubuntu font to print it properly. You may be thinking that the orange is too orangeish, that is because it is the correct CMYK colours for printing which are quite a long way from the RGB colour specification.

==== Ubuntu Global Jam - Another Success Due to LoCo Teams Participation ====

For those of you who still maybe wondering what the Ubuntu Global Jam event is all about here is how the wiki describes it : The Ubuntu Global Jam is an incredible opportunity for the Ubuntu community to unite together... to work together to improve Ubuntu. Everyone is able to contribute to the Jam, and everyone is welcome and encouraged to get involved. Curious about how to make a real difference to Ubuntu? This is a great chance to make that difference.

The Ubuntu Global Jam incorporates events that have been organized over the world to get Ubuntu contributors and fans together to have a great time and improve Ubuntu.

The Ubuntu Global Jam was a big success again this cycle thanks to the amazing participation from the awesome LoCo Teams across the globe.

==== Ara Pulido: Testing your multitouch device ====

Maverick is coming with multitouch & gestures support!

OK, right, this is not news, a lot of people have been already been talking about it, inside the Ubuntu community, and also outside the community. I cannot express how excited I am about multitouch support and the possibilities it opens (phones?, tablets?, the-next-great-small-device?). But, first, we need to test it!

So, maybe, you have a multitouch device. OK, maybe you don’t. Maybe you just have a single touch device (a touchpad, a tablet). OK, maybe you don’t. Maybe you just have a mouse. In all those cases we need your help. Obviously, our main interest is in getting feedback from people with multitouch devices, but, we also need to see if regressions were introduced in the process.

==== Jono Bacon: Incredible Stories Of Free Software and Open Source ====

Jono writes - In a continuation of that theme I am keen to talk about stories.

I have talked about stories quite a bit in my writings on community management (particularly so in my book The Art of Community). Stories are important entities in communities – they are vessels in which we share ideas, lessons we have learned, our experience and more. Many stories come laced with these underlining nuggets of wisdom that we then take aware and help us to refine and improve how we interface with the world and the people around us.

Stories though encompass another significant benefit: they allow us to inspire and encourage others via real-world practical examples of our ethos being put into practice.

Jono asks - What are the most inspiring and encouraging stories of Free Software and community that you have heard? Which story have made those little hairs on the back of your neck stand on end?

To read this post in full go to:

http://www.jonobacon.org/2010/08/30/incredible-stories-of-free-software-and-open-source/

==== Rick Spencer: Why I Have Nothing Interesting to Say ====

Inspired by Jono's post - On Visibility and Change - Rick Spencer, Director of Ubuntu Engineering, discusses Changes to Canonical Organizational Structure, his new role as Director of Ubuntu Engineering, being part of the community and transparency.  Rick also discusses the partnership between Canonical and Ubuntu.

To read learn more about Rick and see what he's been up to go to:

http://theravingrick.blogspot.com/2010/09/why-i-have-nothing-interesting-to-say.html

==== Raphaël Hertzog: Understanding Membership Structures in Debian and Ubuntu ====

Debian and Ubuntu have a set of official membership roles that can be granted to regular contributors. Those roles come with rights that enable the contributors to do their work and to participate in the project governance (elections and other official decision-making processes). It’s also a way for the distributions to acknowledge the work done: most contributors are proud of the status they reached.

The membership structure plays an important role in the development of a distribution: it defines the kind of contributors that are welcome in the project, it sets expectations of the project towards its contributors and defines their rights. In the end, this shapes the project’s ability to recruit new contributors to keep the project alive and kicking. This article introduces the existing statuses in Debian and Ubuntu, and defines the — sometimes confusing — jargon associated with them.

For more information on these membership structures go to:

http://raphaelhertzog.com/?p=723

==== Daniel Holbach's: What I do ====

Daniel Holbach, Ubuntu Community Team, talks about what his thoughts about his job, Ubuntu and the community were 6 years ago when he started with Canonical, what all he has worked on, and what he continues to work on now.

A few of his observations back then were:

* how friendly, encouraging and motivating people were: in a very short time I made lots of friends, people who are always there for me and I’d always be there for (extended family  – kind of)
* how much I learned in a very short period of time (a state of constant “a-ha! moments”)
* the incredibly strong sense of opportunity: “if I fix this bug, I not only fix it for myself, but for millions of users”

If you want to know more about Daniel go to:

http://daniel.holba.ch/blog/?p=776

==== Dustin Kirkland: How My Work Benefits Free Software ====

Dustin Kirkland, Canonical Server Team, says - I'm personally offended when Canonical and Ubuntu are dogged about a perceived lack of contribution to the Free Software ecosystem.

So I'd like to talk about the work I have been doing at Canonical on Ubuntu, and how I believe it benefits Free Software in 7 important ways:
1. Packaging
2. Documentation
3. Communication
4. Conferences
5. Upstream Contributions
6. Being an Upstream
7. Bringing Free Software to the Masses

To read Dustin's post in full and see what he has to say about these 7 areas go to:

==== Ara Pulido: Multitouch testers in the Hall of Fame ====

Thanks to Daniel Holbach, the people testing uTouch and reporting back in the Multitouch Testing Tracker now appear in the Ubuntu Hall of Fame.

If you have been helping testing MT and you’re name does not appear there, is due to a bug in the ISO tracker, that prevents testers that haven’t set their Launchpad ID properly. This bug has been fixed, and it will be released in our next roll out of the testing tracker, but, in the mean while, there is a workaround that I explained in a previous post.

Please, if you are helping testing uTouch, check out how to appear in the Hall Of Fame.

==== Canonical's X Gesture Extension Being Re-Evaluated ====

Earlier this month Canonical introduced its own multi-touch framework for Ubuntu that is set to premiere with Ubuntu 10.10 "Maverick Meerkat" and it's called UTouch and is joined by their own gesture/touch language. That same day as announcing UTouch for Ubuntu that will support devices like the Apple Magic Track``Pad and Dell XT2, Canonical proposed the X.Org Gesture Extension to the X.Org development community. While it's good to see Canonical making more contributions to upstream projects that it depends upon for Ubuntu Linux, the X.Org Gesture Extension is already being re-evaluated and may in fact not be needed.

==== Choose a Desktop Linux Distribution ====

Katherine Noyes, with ITWorld writes  - With all the many reasons to use Linux today--particularly in a business setting--it's often a relatively easy decision to give Windows the boot. What can be more difficult, however, is deciding which of the hundreds of Linux distributions out there is best for you and your business.

Judging by popularity statistics, as tracked both by Distrowatch and in a recent study at Linux``Trends, Ubuntu is clearly the most popular distribution, or "distro." There's no denying that Ubuntu has many benefits for business users; at the same time, there are many, many other possibilities, each offering its own twist on Linux.

==== StackApplet Displays Your Ubuntu Stack Exchange Reputation On The GNOME Panel ====

Stack``Applet is a simple GNOME Panel applet which checks your Stack Exchange reputation every X minutes and displays it on the panel. Stack``Applet works with any Stack Exchange website and in fact, it can display your reputation across multiple websites at once.

Besides displaying your reputation, Stack``Applet also notifies you when comments are posted to you.

==== This week in design – 3 September 2010 ====

This week was a short one in the UK but it seems as though we set out to fill it with as much as we possibly could! For a start we hit beta this week. If you’ve not upgraded to Maverick, you really should. We all have and are enjoying the updated Radiance and Ambiance themes. On the subject of arrivals we also welcomed Lilly to our web team this week – we’ll set her up on the blog in the coming weeks and coax a post or two out of her.

==== Thinking different at Canonical ====

Matt Asay, Canonical COO, notes the following on his blog - Canonical really needs to be different, because Ubuntu is different. Ubuntu is a user phenomenon, not necessarily an enterprise phenomenon. We have a great deal of enterprise adoption (tops in both development and deployment according to recent surveys), but that adoption came through individual developers choosing to use Ubuntu, and not through some heavy-handed corporate decision to do so.

He also asks at the end of this post - What do you think? What would you do if you worked in Canonical’s marketing department?

==== IBM DB2 on Ubuntu 10.04 LTS ====

All IBM DB2 Editions are validated on Ubuntu 10.04. This is an important validation for Ubuntu as it demonstrates that the IBM DB2 team believes Ubuntu is an important platform to validate against. IBM previously validated 8.04 LTS. This shows IBM’s long-term commitment to Ubuntu. Check out the DB2 Enterprise-C virtual appliances on Amazon EC2. These appliances enable developers who are already using DB2 on Ubuntu to have an option on the Amazon cloud.

==== Embedded Linux Conference, April 2010 Videos ====

Colin King writes - I had the privilege to attend the Embedded Linux Conference in San Francisco in April this year. Like all conferences with multiple tracks it's impossible to attend all the talks, fortunately Free Electrons are hosting the slides and videos of a lot of the talks, so one can catch up on all the goodness at http://free-electrons.com/blog/elc-2010-videos/.

==== Ohio LinuxFest Proves Real FOSS Diversity ====

The annual Ohio Linux``Fest is a genuine grass-roots community event. It is one of the most fun and most worthwhile Linux fests, and one of the most welcoming-- everyone from brand-new Linux users, people curious about Linux, to wizened gurus and everyone in between are welcome.
Many of the big-name Linux fests pay lip service to diversity, but don't invest much energy in trying to attract a diverse audience, or a diverse range of speakers. The organizers of the 2010 Ohio Linux``Fest wanted more women speakers, and with a bit of effort were able to attract many more than before:

"With a little outreach effort, and embracing diversity as a core value, the Ohio Linux``Fest has successfully recruited more women to share their experience at OLF.
'How'd we do? While last year only five of the speakers at Ohio Linux``Fest were women, out of a total of 31, this year 14 of the 38 speakers are women. That's a third of the conference speaking slots! One of the two keynoters is a woman. There were 107 talk proposals for the 27 general speaking slots. "

Read the rest of Maco's report to learn how they succeeded. It's nothing all that mysterious, just applying a bit of smarts.

** Attendance: nhandler, Pici, topyli, jussi (for ~4 minutes)

** [TOPIC] Support channel bug parsing

** No technical reason to have bug info fetching disabled in #ubuntu, #kubuntu, and #xubuntu

** Some concern about the added noise that the bug info will create and about the possibility of the bug info leading to off-topic discussion in the support channels.

** [TOPIC] Legitimacy of discussing policies and op actions by people not directly affected

** LjL presented, citing a recent even where he was asked to leave -ops after disagreeing with the ban placed on another user.

** Present parties agreed that it was unhelpful for third parties to be allowed to act as another's attorney.

** We discussed the current appeals process and how that could be modified. We would explicitly mention this particular use-case in the wiki page.

** [AGREED] We shall slightly revise the appeals wiki entry to clarify that users may dispute operator actions even when they were not the user affected by such actions.
