==== Jaunty Alpha 3 released ====

Jaunty Jackalope Alpha 3, which will in time become Ubuntu 9.04, has been released. Alpha 3 is the second in a series of milestone CD images that will be released throughout the Jaunty development cycle.  The Alpha images are known to be reasonably free of show stopper CD build or installer bugs, while representing a very recent snapshot of Jaunty. You can download it here:

* Ubuntu: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/jaunty/alpha-3/
* Edubuntu: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/edubuntu/releases/jaunty/alpha-3/
* Kubuntu: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/releases/jaunty/alpha-3/
* Xubuntu: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/xubuntu/releases/jaunty/alpha-3/
* Ubuntu Studio: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntustudio/releases/jaunty/alpha-3/
* Mythbuntu: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/mythbuntu/releases/jaunty/alpha-3/

See http://wiki.ubuntu.com/Mirrors for a list of mirrors.

Pre-releases of Jaunty are *not* encouraged for anyone needing a stable system or anyone who is not comfortable running into occasional, even frequent breakage.  They are, however, recommended for Ubuntu developers and those who want to help in testing, reporting, and fixing bugs.

See all the details at: https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel-announce/2009-January/000524.html

==== Ubuntu Developer Week ====

Welcome to the Ubuntu Developer Week! There will be one week of action-packed sessions from Jan 19th to Jan 23rd! Ubuntu Developer Week is a series of online workshops where you can:

* learn about different packaging techniques
* find out more about different development teams
* check out the efforts of the world-wide Development Community
* participate in open Q&A sessions with Ubuntu developers
* and much more...

You can find the timetable of sessions at the link below.

https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDeveloperWeek

==== Fridge Mockups ====

At the last UDS there was a much needed discussion about a new "News" site for the community. Work has now begun on this proposal, and the first step of creating some basic templates for the pages is ready. Feedback would be appreciated, since this is going to be a community based news site.

* Blueprint: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/community-communications-internal-external
* Summary of UDS session: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Community/Specs/PlatformExternalInternalNews
* Rationale behind the idea: http://www.ndeschildre.net/2008/11/30/on-ubuntu-community-news/

What might you expect to see that differs from the current Fridge news site:

* A new theme: 2 different themes are ready for viewing
* Highlighted stories will be chosen: for more important stories
* 3 targeted audience sections: World, Lo``Co, and Development
* Multi lingual support: thanks to some Drupal plugins
* A new name: possibilities include "Ubuntu News"
* Anyone could post to the site: posting would then be reviewed and posted
* Planet blogs: would automatically be put in the quay for review and posting
* Comment support: including picture support would be available
* Video and flash support: embedding of flash and video format on the site
* Inter website navigation bar: to allow linking to all the major Ubuntu sites

You can view the purposed themes, find more details, and leave your comments at the link below:

http://www.ndeschildre.net/2009/01/10/ubuntu-news-website-mockups/

==== Technical Board Run off ====

There is now a ballot of Ubuntu developers, to select a new member of the Technical Board. Note: Only MOTU and core devs can vote in this process.

   https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-dev/+poll/2009-01-tb-nominees/+vote-simple

The candidates in alphabetical order are Colin Watson and Kees Cook. In a departure from tradition, there will be a race between two candidates, rather than a confirmation vote. Both candidates have indicated that they are happy to be in a race rather than a confirmation. In future, depending on circumstance and candidates, the confirmation approach may take either method. This is a simple two-candidate selection, the winner will be the candidate with the most positive votes. In the event of a tie, Mark Shuttleworth will act as the tie breaker.

Both candidates work for Canonical. While that is not a requirement for the position, the requirements do stack the deck heavily in favor of someone who is able to devote full time
attention to the whole Linux stack, in Ubuntu or Debian, and is very aware of the Ubuntu community processes and players. Please vote soon, the vote is only open for a week.

https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel-announce/2009-January/000522.html

==== UDS Jaunty Proceedings ====

Proceedings from the Ubuntu Developer Summit for Ubuntu 9.04, which took place from 8-12 April in Mountain View, CA, USA, are now available.

The notes are available here:

https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UDSJaunty/Report

They are categorized by track. As you will see there are still a few entries which are missing notes or have only a few bullets; it is encouraged that those of you that participated continue to expand and correct these pages.

==== Awards: Ubuntu Forums, Ubuntu, and Canonical ====

The Ubuntu Forums has been named the "Best Support Resource" in the Linux Format awards according to issue LXF115. The forums community managed to beat the mighty Google for this award. Pretty impressive stuff! Everyone in the Ubuntu community is very proud of the excellent work that goes on in the Ubuntu Forums. 6.5million posts and counting, 745,000 members and growing, the forums are a very valuable resource for Ubuntu and the Ubuntu ethos. They provide an important home for many of our community members. Thank you to Forums Council, the moderators, and all the posters for earning the award. It is also very gratifying to see that Ubuntu won the "Best Distribution" award, and Canonical bagged the "Best Enterprise" award. 2008 was a great year for Ubuntu, with everyones continued support and hard work, 2009 can be even better!

=== LoCo News ===

==== Dutch LoCo bringing it home ====

When the Dutch team asked for help with a computer fair, Jono arranged for 400 Ubuntu CDs to be sent to them. Attendance was heavy, and the disks were gone in only a few hours. Jan Stedehouder, from the Dutch team, stated, "It was good to see people of all ages and nationalities, constantly flocking to the various computers with Ubuntu installed.” Jan is the author of the book “Probleemloos overstappen op Linux” (Migrating without problems to Linux), and will have a new one out soon, “Basiscursus Ubuntu” (Ubuntu Basics course). Jan felt that the use of the "Ubuntu Ethos" in his presentation helped to draw out the ethos of the audience. http://www.jonobacon.org/2009/01/16/dutch-loco-bringing-it-home/

=== Launchpad News ===

==== How Launchpad will open source ====

When a major undertaking occurs, there are always questions.  Launchpad becoming open source is no different.  In brief, the questions are:

* WHAT - Launchpad source code, to be released under the AGPLv3 License
* WHEN - July 21, 2009
* WHERE - On Launchpad.net
* WHY - When a large project reaches the point where a team of limited size can no longer keep up with incoming bug reports, then the team has to choose between letting some bugs go or gathering more developers to help take care of the bugs. Launchpad has decided that the second is the better way, and is open sourcing the code in order to get that help.
* HOW - This is a sticky one, because some code used in Launchpad is specific to the business of Canonical, and some of the dependencies may have licensing problems. Thus, the existing team is going through the code very carefully, passing out to open source what they can right now, and trying to resolve licensing and to determine what is actually proprietary. In addition, they are putting together documentation for developers and making sure that the existing team is comfortable with the open source method to minimize the number of simultaneous changes.
* WHO - Canonical will have the final determination as to what changes make it back into the code. They host the site, therefore they are responsible for what software runs on it.  However, they want to make it as easy as possible for good changes to make it into the site, and have some concrete plans for how to do that. http://news.launchpad.net/general/how-we-are-open-sourcing-launchpad

==== What's new with Launchpad API ====

The Bugs team has published Collaborative Virtual Environments (CVEs) through the web service.  These are associated with every bug.  The Soyuz team has published archives that can be inspected, copied, and managed from the web service.  Also, merge proposals have also been published, but they're read-only for the time being.

Fields can now be modified directly instead of through named operations. And the http_etag has been simplified through the use of Javascript.  For more on these two, and the whole story, see:  http://news.launchpad.net/cool-new-stuff/whats-new-with-the-launchpad-web-service-api

=== In The Press ===

* Windows Vista Business Vs. Ubuntu 8.10 - Edward F. Moltzen of Channel``Web says that while Microsoft Corp. had problems with Vista when it was released, their Service Pack 1 and better driver and application support, has done much to fix the issues. Linux, however isn't seeing these issues, and one distro in particular, stands out. Ubuntu 8.10 Desktop Edition, nicknamed "Intrepid Ibex," provides so much more functionality and ease of use, at zero cost of acquisition, that it is really impossible to ignore. Installing Ubuntu has become a snap, and it scored big against Vista in both performance testing and in wireless integration. Ubuntu beats Vista on performance, client connectivity, portability and sharing, and acquisition price. Head to head, Ubuntu simply beats Vista on so many important points that Windows is no longer the simple, reflexive default. We're calling this one for Ubuntu, plain and simple, because it's a beautifully done operating system. http://www.crn.com/software/212701668

* Dump Windows, save millions - Chin Wong of the Manila Standard Today reports that the Xavier School is demonstrating what most of us have long believed: an organization can safely dump Microsoft Windows and save millions of pesos by replacing it with Linux, a free and open source operating system. The school had about 800 computers, the majority of which were running Windows, and after switching vendors they were told that they were not compliant with Microsoft’s licensing requirements because they did not have base licenses to cover all their computers. When school management saw the cost of the required licenses, it became more receptive to the open source alternative. The large-scale deployment of Ubuntu 8.04, chosen because of its ease of use as a desktop operating system, began in April. Xavier School’s migration to open source is still a work in progress, but it’s already paying dividends. Aside from the huge savings in software licenses, the system has also become more reliable. Pierre Tagle, IT consultant at Xavier, states: “There are much fewer issues of PC's hanging, or viruses with Ubuntu.” http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/?page=business6_jan13_2009

* Fort Sill soldier rehabs old computers, donates to students - KSWO in Wichita Falls, Texas says if you have a job, chances are you use a computer each day, and that's why schools teach students computer skills early. However, while some youngsters get to use a PC or Mac at school, some are unable to use a computer at home because they cost too much money. There's good news for Elgin Elementary however, a soldier stationed at Fort Sill is seeing to it that every student has one. Second Lieutenant Jacob Roecker isn't getting anything in return for taking on the project, stating he only wants to make sure children at Elgin Elementary have the same opportunities as other children. He's been able to do this by getting people to donate their old computers which he then fixes up and installs Edubuntu on. Edubuntu will give families the tools that will help children of all ages. Tux Paint helps younger users learn to use the mouse and get started with navigating the desktop. For high school kids, if they are working through the periodic table of elements, they can see how the atomic structures look - they can do a  Q and A session with each element...really help them out in science class." http://www.kswo.com/Global/story.asp?S=9675283

* Woman blames Dell for missing online classes - Reporter Dan Cassuto of WKOW in Madison, Wisconsin tells us how Abbie Schubert paid more than $1,100 for a Dell laptop equipped with Ubuntu. She wanted to enroll in online classes at Madison Area Technical College(MATC). The person she talked to said Ubuntu was great, college students loved it, and it was compatible with everything she needed. Later, she discovered Ubuntu might look like Windows, but it doesn't always act like it. Her Verizon High-Speed Internet CD wouldn't load, so she can't access the internet. She also can't install Microsoft Word, which she says is a requirement for MATC's online classes. 27 News contacted Dell, but the company has not responded. However, they think they've helped her get back to school. Verizon says it will dispatch a technician to try to assist her accessing the internet without using the Windows-only installation disk. Verizon says its high-speed internet does indeed support Ubuntu. Schubert's computer also came with Open Office installed, a word processing software package that is compatible with Microsoft Word. She says she wasn't aware it was compatible.  MATC promised to show her how to save documents in compatible formats so she could enroll in online courses again. http://www.wkowtv.com/Global/story.asp?S=9667184

* Ubuntu 9.04 Boots in 21.4 Seconds - Marius Nestor, Linux Editor at Softpedia, tells us that this past Tuesday the folks at Softpedia couldn't wait two more days until the third Alpha version of the upcoming Ubuntu 9.04 (Jaunty Jackalope) would be available for testing. They decided to take the current daily build for a test drive to "sweetness" of that evolutionary EXT4 Linux file system. Announced on Christmas Eve, the EXT4 file system is now declared stable and it is distributed with version 2.6.28 of the Linux kernel and later. So how will the end user benefit from this EXT4 filesystem? The whole system will be much faster and more reliable compared to one with EXT3, it will boot faster, and it's able to handle files with sizes of up to 16 TB. Softpedia also tested the boot process of a default Ubuntu 8.10 and 9.04 Alpha on a system with the Intel Core 2 Duo. Ubuntu 8.10 with EXT3 filesystem booted in 26.8 seconds, and Ubuntu 9.04 Alpha (Build 20090112.1) with EXT4 filesystem booted in 21.4 seconds! http://news.softpedia.com/news/Ubuntu-9-04-Boots-in-21-4-Seconds-101885.shtml

* Ubuntu'd HP Mini 1000 Mi Launched - Paul Lilly of Maximum PC doesn't know if Verne Troyer's into the whole netbook scene or the open source movement, but if he is, he can now order HP's Mini 1000 Mi. Sporting a 9-inch screen, the pint sized mobile PC gets randy with the Linux community by trading in Microsoft's Windows XP for a customized version of Ubuntu. A baseline configuration starts at $330 and includes an Intel Atom N270 (1.6GHz) processor, 512MB of DDR2 RAM, 8GB SSD drive, and HP's Mobile internet (Mi) software. Upgrade options include a 10.1-inch display, 1GB DDR2 RAM (currently a free upgrade), 16GB SSD or 60GB 4200 RPM hard drive, and Bluetooth. http://www.maximumpc.com/article/news/ubuntud_hp_mini_1000_mi_launched

=== In The Blogosphere ===

* eRacks to offer Netbooks with Ubuntu, Fedora Linux - C``IOL reports that, eRacks Open Source Systems has been building computers preinstalled with open source operating systems for the past 10 years. They are adding netbooks built by Asus, MSI, and Acer with Ubuntu and Fedora Linux preinstalled. They are doing this for the netbooks that are powered by Intel's Atom processor. The netbooks come with the Open Office suite of software already installed. http://www.ciol.com/Developer/Open-Source/News-Reports/eRacks-to-offer-Netbooks-with-Ubuntu,-Fedora-Linux/12109114721/0/

* 10 predictions for Linux and open source in 2009 - Blogger Jack Wallen predicts that this year Ubuntu server will finally be adopted as a viable solution for enterprise server needs. He also predicts that Ubuntu 9.04 Jaunty Jackalope will become the standard for the user-friendly level of linux operating systems. This is due to the better hardware support that it offers. This also fits in with the prediction that he has. He is predicting that we will continue to see more companies pre-installing linux on their computers. This is backed up by the fact that, Canonical is collaborating with AMD on a version of Ubuntu perfectly matched with the ARM processor. http://www.builderau.com.au/program/linux/soa/10-predictions-for-Linux-and-open-source-in-2009/0,339028299,339294292,00.htm

* Ubuntu 9.04 Receives EXT4 Support - Blogger Michael Larabel of phoronix goes over a new feature that has been added to Ubuntu 9.04. That feature is the support of the EXT4 file system. EXT4 will not replace EXT3 as the default file-system until at least Ubuntu 9.10. This support is found when you manually partition the disk during install. He tested both the alternate and Live``CDs, using the EXT4 files system, and he reported that, the EXT4 file-system for the / partition worked as expected without any issues. http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=ubuntu_ext4&num=1

=== Meeting Summaries ===

==== Technical Board Meeting Minutes ====

Attendees:

* Mark Shuttleworth
* Scott James Remnant
* Matt Zimmerman (chair)

Agenda:

* ubuntu-core-dev application from Dustin Kirkland (kirkland)
* Limited main upload rights for Stephane Graber
* Getting correct information on the fridge about this meeting (mdz)
* Technical Board nominations (sabdfl)
* cdrtools (mdz)
* Archive Reorganization and governance impact thereof (mdz) https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArchiveReorganisation
* Patent policy (mdz)

Minutes:

Meeting times and the Fridge:

* The meeting time was incorrect on the Fridge calendar, and needs to be updated. It would be far preferable if a member of the Board could do this directly. Matt recorded an action to follow up with the news team.

ubuntu-core-dev application from Dustin Kirkland:

* Dustin's application was accepted and approved by the Board, and he is now our newest core developer.

Upload rights for LTSP in main for Stephane Graber:

* The Board approved Oliver's request, on behalf of Stephane, for privileges to upload the italc, ltsp, ldm and ltspfs packages to main.

cdrtools:

* Nothing has happened since early December. Matt took an action to ping the parties involved in the discussion.

Archive Reorganization and governance:

* We were short on time in the meeting, and a separate meeting on this topic (with the MOTU Council) is scheduled for later this week, so it was deferred.

Patent policy:

* The lack of a clear policy on patents is blocking a complete response from the Board to a developer inquiry.  There wasn't time to hash this out during the meeting, and it still needs work.

Technical Board nominations:

* Mark nominated Colin Watson and Kees Cook for one open position on the Board. A run-off vote of Ubuntu developers has been announced on ubuntu-devel-announce and is in progress at: https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-dev/+poll/2009-01-tb-nominees/+vote-simple Note: voting is for MOTU and core devs only.

Other business:

* Colin Watson asked for guidance on the management of the OEM tracking ID namespace. It was agreed that the Technical Board would manage this for now.

==== Server Team Meeting Minutes ====

Server Team meeting minutes can also be viewed here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MeetingLogs/Server/20090113.

Screen Profiles:

* kirland announced that he uploaded a new version of the screen-profiles package to jaunty. Versions for hardy and intrepid are also available from his PPA[1]. He stated that it was totally awesome now and posted a screenshot [2]. He is looking for more testers.

ACTION: kirkland to write a blog post about screen-profile

SRU for ebox:

* sommer reported that all the bugs had been updated and submitted to the motu-sru team. zul uploaded relevant packages to intrepid-proposed which are waiting for the ACK from the motu-sru team.

libmysqlclient-dev package (MySQL 5.1) in jaunty:

* mathiaz reported that libmysqlclient15-dev is currently a transitional package depending on libmysqlclient-dev. Both packages are provided by mysql-dsfg-5.1. Unfortunately that breaks builds in main that depends on libmysqlclient15-dev since mysql-dfsg-5.1 is in universe. For now MySQL 5.0 is still the preferred package and should stay in main while MySQL 5.1 is part of universe. After some discussion it was decided to upload a new version of mysql-dfsg-5.1 that would provide libmysqlclient16-dev instead of libmysqlclient{,15-dev}. libmysqlclient16-dev won't provide libmysqlclient-dev. A new version of mysql-dfsg-5.0 will also be uploaded with the version 5.1.30really5.0.75-0ubuntu1 in order to restore a working libmysqlclient15-dev package. libmysqlclient15-dev will provide libmysqlclient-dev.

ACTION: mathiaz to upload mysql packages to fix libmysqlclient{15,16,}-dev
packages in jaunty

Ubuntu Server on NAS devices:

* persia asked what would be required to turn one of his little ARM servers into a complete NAS device. There was some discussion about which services would be provided (NFS, CIFS, SFTP) and the need for a management interface. ebox may provide the latter. The first step however is to test whether cifs (via samba) and may be nfs are working correctly on ARM. zul mentioned that access to ARM devices was a blocker. persia volunteered to run an ARM install of Server through the test cases to check the current status and what needs to be done. He is also looking for help chasing down some of the bugs he might uncover during the process.

Agree on next meeting date and time

* Next meeting will be on Tuesday, January 20th at 16:00 UTC in #ubuntu-meeting.
