|-
| '''Device'''
| '''Works Out of Box?'''
| '''Works with User Intervention'''
| '''Notes'''
| '''Bug #'''
|-
| Screen
| Yes
| 
| Widescreen format. Very flat and smooth
| 
|-

| <-4> '''Power Management'''
|-
| Battery detected?
| Yes

|-
| Hibernates?
| No
| 
| Screen went black and appeared to go into hibernate mode. Cursor appeared in upper left corner. System would not awaken. Had to reboot.
| 
|-
| Sleep/Suspend
| No
| 
| Only one way to reliably put the system in suspend is by pressing the silver suspend button next to the wireless toggle switch on the keyboard. System will hang (i.e., screen remains black) if I initiate the suspend using any other method. For example, by clicking on the red Quit button (upper right) and then click on the Suspend icon. Also had problems with lost network connection when going in suspend mode. Corrected this by turning off the wireless network device and back on again sing the wireless device toggle switch. Investigating this issue.
