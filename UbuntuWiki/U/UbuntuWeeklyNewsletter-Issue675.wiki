==== Stable Release Updates on Xubuntu ====

Sean Davis writes about Stable Release Updates (SRU) and how they keep Xubuntu updated and safe once a release reaches Final Freeze. Sean outlines what fixes qualify for SRU updates, for Xubuntu in particular, with an example of two packages currently going through SRU (Exo & XFCE weather plugin). In walking us through each of the steps performed in SRUs, detail is provided that allows users to help contribute via testing and then recording their testing of these fixes. This process promotes updated packages to end-users faster.
