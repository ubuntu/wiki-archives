==== Ubuntu 9.10 Beta released ====

The Ubuntu team is pleased to announce the beta release of Ubuntu 9.10 Desktop, Server editions, and Ubuntu Netbook Remix.  Codenamed "Karmic Koala", 9.10 continues Ubuntu's proud tradition of integrating the latest and greatest open source technologies into a high-quality, easy-to-use Linux distribution.

Ubuntu 9.10 Desktop Edition improves on the work of 9.04 to get you going faster, with improved start-up times and a streamlined boot experience.

Ubuntu 9.10 Server Edition integrates Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud set-up in the installer and provides improvements to system security with App``Armor, including an App``Armor profile for libvirtd to further isolate virtual machines from the host system.

The Ubuntu 9.10 family of variants, Kubuntu, Xubuntu, Edubuntu, Ubuntu Studio, and Mythbuntu, also reach beta status.

To upgrade to Ubuntu 9.10 Beta from Ubuntu 9.04, follow these instructions: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/KarmicUpgrades

==== Ubuntu 9.10 Countdown Banners ====

Ubuntu 9.10 Beta images were released Thursday. What you might not know is that the countdown banners have also been released.

* You can grab them here: http://go2.wordpress.com/?id=725X1342&site=andrewsomething.wordpress.com&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ubuntu.com%2Fgetubuntu%2Fcountdown

There are 3 different version, 2 different image groups that use a java script, and a static non-java version for those who can't use java scripts on their website or blogs. Help us to promote the new Karmic release by adding the banner to your website to express your "Ubuntu Pride."

==== Ubuntu 9.10 Karmic Koala Beta Released: Testers Needed! ====

Our global community of contributors and developers has worked tirelessly to get this Beta out, and there are lots of great features in there including Upstart switched on by default, improved boot experience, the new Ubuntu Software Center, new messaging indicator changes, and lots of EC2 and Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud awesomeness.

But wait, before you go and download it, we want to talk about the point of a beta…it is, in a word…TESTING!

Unfortunately, nestled inside all of the lovelyness described are some inevitable bugs. While we have an incredible bunch of people at Canonical and in the community that fix bugs, we are really looking to you good people to hunt these bugs down and report them so we (a) know about them and can (b) fix them and make Ubuntu the best Operating System it can be.

The whole system needs testing, but there are some key topics which some of us in Ubuntu land would like you to give a solid test to. It is these features which are new to Ubuntu and need the most love and attention. So, let’s cover them:

* Empathy Audio and Video calls
* Boot Experience
* EC2

If you have any questions or queries about testing and filing bugs, here are some resources:

* Reporting Bugs – this page provides more detail about how to file a bug with ubuntu-bug and other tools. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ReportingBugs
* General Testing Team Documentation – there is lots of help here on these pages about how to help with testing Ubuntu. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing

Detailed information on the above listed items for testing can be found at the link below.

==== Planning of Karmic Release Parties kicks off! ====

For every Ubuntu release we like to organize parties all over the world. At these parties everyone is welcome and we get together to celebrate, meet new friends and often introduce people new to Ubuntu to our community and our Operating System. Release parties are not only a great way to meet people but they are a lot of fun!

This guide[1] explains how best to run a great release party and you can get a lot of advice and help with the planning on the ubuntu-event-planners[2] and loco-contacts[3] mailing lists.

Be sure to add your party to the Karmic Release Parties wiki, and post pictures of the party in your blog afterwards. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KarmicReleaseParties

Karmic``Koala is coming, scheduled for release in October 2009. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KarmicKoala

==== Ubuntu Karmic Free Culture Showcase Winners Announced! ====

With each release of Ubuntu we ship a package called example-content which provides some example video, audio, images and information that can help a new user get started exploring their Ubuntu system. In each cycle we like to use example-content as a means of showcasing a Video, Audio, and Photo/Graphic artist who releases their work under a free Creative Commons license.

A few months back Jono announced the opening of the competition and we have had a tremendous collection of entries posted on the competition page. He wants to give a huge thank you to everyone who participating in the competition. The final choices were made by a set of judges and finally by the Ubuntu Community Council. To see the content you will need to check out Karmic when it is released on the 29th October, but without any further ado let's introduce our incredible set of winners!

* Video winner: Water and Wind by Eugenia Loli-Queru
* Audio winner: Hungry Lucy
* Photo/Graphic winner: Daniel Galleguillos

Background summaries of each of the winners is available at the link below.

http://www.jonobacon.org/2009/10/01/ubuntu-karmic-free-culture-showcase-winners-announced/

==== Changes to releases.ubuntu.com rsync/FTP access ====

The Ubuntu sysadmins have asked us to advise people about some upcoming changes to rsync and FTP access to releases.ubuntu.com. In order to distribute CD images more effectively, releases.ubuntu.com will shortly be reorganised such that it can only support access over HTTP. If you need rsync or FTP access, please use the new hostnames rsync.releases.ubuntu.com or ftp.releases.ubuntu.com respectively. Access methods such as Bit``Torrent and jigdo are unaffected by this change.

==== Ubuntu France: Having a great time at Toulouse Jam ====

Gather almost 20 people around 2 Ubuntu developers in order to work on Ubuntu and you will end up with a nice global jam! After explaining to the group the basic usage of Launchpad in the morning session, the afternoon rocked! As always in Tououse, this is done thanks to the cooperation of Toulibre (Toulouse LUG), and ubuntu-fr. Pictures at the link.

==== Ubuntu Ohio Global Jam 2009 ====

The Ohio Global Jam ‘09 just got wrapped up. Amazing showing, and outstanding event. The team had a blast! A big shout out to Digitalvectorz, Mathay, Ken, Mike, Chris, Anthony, Andrew, Joe, Dr. Palmer, and the John Carroll Computer Science department where the event was held. Pictures at the links below.

==== Ubuntu Florida: Global Jam ====

The Florida team met at the Stardust Cafe where Chaynie lead an in-service on packaging a python application for Ubuntu. The venue was nice except it lacked a persistent wireless connection, which made pulling down all the required packages quite a challenge! Most of the crowd was able to follow along, and a lot of those that were there learned a bunch about packaging. There are some pictures from the web cam using cheese at the link below.

==== Ubuntu Massachusetts / MIT Jam ====

The Ubuntu Massachusetts team were at the MIT Strata Center for the MIT SIPB organized Jam event. It was an awesome all day event that didn’t end until very late in the day, they managed to sort out a whole bunch of asciidoc course/class rewriting from the old odf format. They also spent some of the day looking at pygames and packaging. Pictures at the link below.

==== Ubuntu-Tour in Honduras ====

The Ubuntu Honduras Lo``Co Team did another presentation in the Instituto Tridentino
locate it on the city of San Pedro Sula. They were also planning on taking part in the Global Jam that just concluded, and hope is will be the first of many jams they participate in. If you are a Spanish speaker, you can learn more about the "Tour of Honduras" at the links below.

==== Philadelphia be Jammin'! ====

The Philadelphia Mythbuntu Jam is in full swing, Andrew Keyes has been taking photos and posting them up on flickr: http://www.flickr.com/photos/ahotw/sets/72157622383830903/ There are a couple of panoramic views of the event at the link below. Awesome! The team ended up having 22 people come out and help at the event.

==== Michigan Checking in! ====

The Ubuntu Michigan team met at SRT Solutions for their jam event. An early report with not a lot of detail, but you can see a picture of the event which looks to have about 10 people jammin' away.

==== North Carolina Team: Ubuntu Global Jam at the 1927 Lake Lure Inn and Spa ====

The NC Lo``Co Team is one of the many teams participating in the "Awesomeness" that is Ubuntu Global Jam Weekend. Amber thoughtfully went ahead and posted some pics to help share the fun with everyone.

==== Ubuntu El Salvador Team: Mangini ====

For Ubuntu Community people, this an one of the big projects of the Ubuntu El Salvador Team. We are working for the Salvadorean education because we know.. "ubuntu can change the mind and the education of guys." Padre Richard Mangini Institute is an big example...now they a have a sub Lo``co team and the name is “Ubuntu Mangini” More information is available at the link if you are a Spanish speaker. Pictures are also available.

=== Launchpad News ===

==== Help Launchpad get better icons ====

We’re trying to improve the icons we have in Launchpad so they’re more usable across different cultures and types of users, and our first step is to do some user testing on our current icons. The Canonical User Experience team has set up a survey to gather information on how users see our icons, so if you have a few spare minutes (it’s very quick!), please take the survey and pass it on to other people, especially if they don’t use Launchpad, as they will be less biased.

* Survey is available at: http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=8hXmjrmFS7TmQCjh7jJB_2bQ_3d_3d

=== Ubuntu Forums News ===

==== Tutorial of the Week ====

Quite often, there is a delay between latest stable application version from an upstream project and updated version from the Ubuntu repositories. This gap is quite important with ALSA. Here is a tutorial from soundcheck (http://ubuntuforums.org/member.php?u=343879) that will help you install the latest official stable ALSA release: "ALSA Upgrade Script". The script should be used with caution as it installs packages itself without going through official repositories. A restore option is provided to reinstall sensitive packages and get them back to their previous Ubuntu version. Many sound issues appear to be solved by this tutorial!

==== Michael Lustfield: Ubuntu Drupal Modules Released ====

The Ubuntu-Drupal team has been working hard to bring some really awesome features to the Ubuntu community. We're pushing for a final 6.6.0 release before Drupal 7 is released. We've completed a few great modules for you to try.

UD Theme - This is what started it all. This theme has undergone massive changes and is now working great. It is meant to mimic the Ubuntu website within legal agreements. http://drupal.org/project/udtheme

UD Countdown - This allows you to add a block to your site to count down to the next Ubuntu release. It has been updated for Karmic Koala. http://drupal.org/project/udcountdown

US Sidebar - This is the latest completed module. It is meant to mimic the side bar of the Ubuntu website that everyone seems to crave. It still needs RTL adjustments, but it is doing great. http://drupal.org/project/udsidebar

UD Header - This allows you to have that pretty little header on every page. (Not the really big one.) It will allow you to set a header combination for every content type you have. http://drupal.org/project/udheader

We can always use developers interested in Drupal and Ubuntu. If you're interested we sit in #ubuntu-drupal on Freenode. We still have these modules that need to be completed.

UD Planet - This has been a tedious project. The goal is to mimic how Planet``Planet (planet.ubuntu.com) works within Drupal. http://drupal.org/project/udplanet

UD Lo``Co Map - This has been a tedious project as well. Our goal is to offer a fully dynamic and flexible map of all Lo``Co's. We need some support going to this module as well the Lo``Co-Directory project as well to complete this project. http://drupal.org/project/udlocomap

BUGS! If you find bugs... please report them. It makes us happy to see these modules going under punishment. Each link above has a link within it that will bring you to the Launchpad development page. This is where bugs should be filed.

==== Martin Meredith: I'm really enjoying Karmic ====

My laptop’s one of those annoying ones that have problems, however, it seems Karmic has fixed a fair chunk of those. My wireless now works (though still only with WPA networks for some reason). I no longer have to boot with “nolapic_timer” (urgh!) and those annoying little niggles are gone. Also, Karmic is looking pretty swish. It’s new notification icons are stylish and minimal, and the xsplash looks good. Also, I’ve noticed that shut down time is drastically reduced! (2 seconds vs my old 10-15 seconds). Boot time isn’t amazing, but it’s pretty nippy. I’m lovin it.

==== Mathias Gug: Test run - Ubuntu Netbook Remix 9.10 Beta on my Dell Mini 10v ====

At the begining of the week I received a Dell Mini 10v I had ordered a few of weeks ago. I had chosen to upgrade some of the default components: my Mini 10v comes with 2Gb of RAM and a 16 GB SSD drive. And of course Ubuntu Hardy 8.04 LTS is installed by default at the factory. Now that the Beta of Karmic has been released I decided to take the opportunity to download the Ubuntu Netbook Remix iso and boot from a USB stick to see how this variant of Ubuntu looked like. Impressive for a beta release. Of course there are few glitches but overall it feels great: I’m writing this article from my Mini 10v running an Ubuntu Netbook Remix 9.10 Beta live system. Read about all of Mathias's experiences with the 9.10 beta release of Netbook Remix at the link.

==== Shane Fagan: Epiphany in Karmic ====

I just tried the new version of epiphany in karmic that uses webkit and it's very nice. I have been a firefox user for about 3 years now but now firefox is becoming a little out of place. Its really strange when you try Epiphany because it's like firefox but it's more integrated but on the flip side it's missing some features. The integration is great in very small little touches, it's very integrated with GNOME’s theme and the address bar doubles as a progress bar for the page loading (I love that). Also, everything can be moved or removed if the user wants to(I love this too). The biggest difference is webkit, with webkit pages load nice and fast and it passes the acid3 test (unlike firefox).

Of course some things annoy me about epiphany like the spell checker deletes words, why is there a tabs menu bar entry when its a button on the browser anyway? Why is it so easy to just open the browser and view/edit all of the passwords without asking the user for a password? So really I don't know which I will use, it's a choice between full featured Firefox and fast and integrated Epiphany.

==== Luis de Bethencourt: edubuntu in sunray ====

Luis tells us about edubuntu in sun ray installation in an Italian primary school at Rome. There are 5 edubuntu desktops in 5 classrooms. Free as in freedom, fun as in kids, and eco as in electricity saving! Pictures available at the link.

=== In The Press ===

==== First Look at Ubuntu 9.10 Karmic Koala Beta ====

Life Hacker's Kevin Purdy notes that the beta release of Karmic Koala, the next version of Ubuntu Linux, just arrived on the net. In general, Ubuntu 9.10, or Karmic Koala, doesn't have a whole ton of new-new features over what we saw in 9.04. That's because a lot of the focus has been on more nuts-and-bolts areas, like boot-up management, application security, and other deep-down bits. That said, there is some new stuff worth checking out. Follow this link for a screen shot tour.

==== Ubuntu gets set to mark fifth birthday ====

Sam Varghese of IT Wire says it seems like only yesterday that Warty Warthog was making its debut to cheers among the crowd who had always wanted a distribution based on the unstable development stream of Debian. At the end of this month Karmic Koala will be out for download, and it will be another proud moment for Mark Shuttleworth. Shuttleworth has succeeded beyond his wildest dreams as far as usage goes, but he still has a few mountains left to climb as he tries to remove the red ink from the Canonical books. Karmic Koala is an excellent milestone, and a fitting one to mark the fifth birthday. Many happy returns of the day, Mark.

http://www.itwire.com/content/view/28023/1090/

==== Mark Shuttleworth's Radical Vision ====

Carla Schroder of Linux Planet notes that Mark Shuttleworth's Linux``Con keynote has gotten a lot of attention. Some for being the big Linux celebrity, some for making some unfortunate comments, and a small bit for his actual message. "People often ask me why I'm so fascinated by Free software , and why I put so much time, energy, and money into Ubuntu...I really believe the Free software process is the right way to build software. Not only that, but there is the potential, if we raise our game... that we could end up defining the experience that the average person has whenever they turn on a computer." Hit this link to read more of Schroder's comments, or to watch the video of Shuttleworth's speach.

==== FreeBSD 8.0 vs. Ubuntu 9.10 Benchmarks ====

Phoronix's Michael Larabel reminds us that Canonical will be releasing Ubuntu 9.10 at the end of next month while the final release of Free``BSD 8.0 is also expected within the next few weeks. With these two popular free software operating systems both having major updates coming out at around the same time, he decided it warranted some early benchmarking as we see how the Free``BSD 8.0 and Ubuntu 9.10 performance compares. More times than not, Ubuntu 9.10 Alpha 6 came out on top compared to Free``BSD 7.2 and 8.0-RC releases.

==== Ubuntu 9.10 Beta Is Available for Download ====

Marius Nestor of Softpedia tells us that the Ubuntu development team has unleashed the Beta release of the upcoming Ubuntu 9.10 (Karmic Koala) operating system, due for launch in late October this year. What's new in Ubuntu 9.10 Beta? Well, as you probably already know, there is now a revamped Human theme, the Humanity icons and lots of wallpapers! Moreover, the Ubuntu Software Store has been renamed to Ubuntu Software Center and updated several times in the last two weeks. And... in order to improve the boot performance, the Ubuntu developers have now transitioned to Upstart. Follow this link for further details.

==== ZaReason's New Terra A20 Ubuntu Netbook: Everything Works ====

Linux Planet's Paul Ferrill tells us that many vendors offer a variety of operating system options, but very few pre-load an OS targeted specifically at the netbook. Za``Reason is one of the few and pre-loads Ubuntu 9.04 Netbook Remix on their Terra A20 netbook. If you were to take a look under the hood of the Za``Reason netbook, you'd find an Intel Atom N270 1.6 GHz processor, up to 2 GB of memory and a variety of options for the hard disk. They also offer, as an option, a built-in 3G wireless modem for $99. At a base price of $349 it's slightly higher than similarly equipped units from Acer, Asus or HP. You could get one of these and just install Ubuntu Netbook Remix yourself or, you could support a fine company in Za``Reason and expect to get real service and support. The choice is yours.

==== Ubuntu One: Canonical Raising Storage Limit ====

Joe Panettieri, of Works With U, talks about the initial Beta testing of Ubuntu One and suggestions that have been made for improving it.  Initially, the storage limit for Ubuntu One was 2 gig for the free service, and up to 10 gig for $10 per month.  Ubuntu One Product Manager Matt Griffin made it official on October 1st that the paid subscription would be 50 gig for $10 per month.  Other suggestions have been made by Beta testers, including making Ubuntu One available for Mac OS X, iPhone and Windows users, too, but so far third party developers haven't come up with anything concrete.

==== Ubuntu: good enough for grannies and girlfriends ====

Shane O'Sullivan just installed Ubuntu 9.04 on his girlfriend's new EEE Netbook.  He had been disappointed with 8.10 and it's support of the Huawei Mobile Broadband modem he has, and wasn't sure that his girlfriend would be able to connect to the internet with Ubuntu.  But, to his surprise, it connected perfectly.  He was impressed with the amount of device driver support that has gone into Ubuntu.  As for his girlfriend, who is not interested in computers or open source, she now complains about having to boot into Windows, because "Ubuntu is so much easier and faster to use."  His article is at the link.

==== U Done Me Right. U Done Me Wrong ====

Marcel Gagné begins a new blog for Ubuntu User with an introduction of himself, and a description of his "love/hate" relationship with Ubuntu.  Actually, his problem is that he likes Kubuntu, personally, but found that Kubuntu 9.04 had some real problems. Now that he's tried Karmic Koala Alpha 5, though, the problems that Jaunty had seem to have been solved. See what he has to say at his blog.

==== Karmic Koala: That's One Seriously Fast Marsupial ====

Jason Perlow, in his blog "Tech Broiler" on ZDNet, was surprised to see that Karmic Koala would boot in 15 seconds.  He had installed it in a virtual box, and actually got the time down to 10 seconds with some virtual box tweaks.  That's 15 seconds from BIOS post to full desktop.  Karmic Koala comes with the latest GIMP 2.6 as well as Open``Office 3.1. and Firefox 3.5.3.  Also included is a 2.6.31 Linux kernel and it now uses the GRUB 2 bootloader and ext4 file system by default.  In all, he appeared to be impressed with the improvements.  For more on his thoughts, see his blog.

==== Review of Ubuntu 9.04 ====

Andrew was impressed when he installed Ubuntu 9.04 on a girlfriend's computer.  All the things that he expected to not operate worked out-of-the-box.  Volume control on the keyboard, printer installation, things that he didn't expect to work, worked perfectly.  And updates!  He's not a fan of auto updates on a server, but with a desktop he found them to work very well.  He gives it two thumbs up for the new or casual desktop linux user.

=== In Other News ===

==== PlayOnLinux to be in Ubuntu's repositories ====

Play``On``Linux will be available via the Universe repositories in Karmic 9.10 due to be released in October. About PlayOnLinux : Play``On``Linux is a piece of sofware which allows you to easily install and use numerous games and softwares designed to run within Windows. Few games are compatible with GNU/Linux at the moment and it certainly is a factor preventing the migration to this OS. Play``On``Linux brings an accessible and efficient solution to this problem, cost-free and respectful of free software. New games available in Play``On``Linux include: Age of Empire 3, and Supreme commander/Supreme Commander Forged Alliance.
