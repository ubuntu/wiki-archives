Thom Holwerda reminds us of how Matthais Ettrich sent out an email to a newsgroup that introduced what became KDE 25 years ago, before giving us the opinion that KDE’s new Plasma is "a gust of fresh air", partially due to the updated 'Breeze - Blue Ocean' theme. We are also told of some of the other features found in Plasma 25AE.

Ankush Das describes Dash to Dock as one of the "most useful GNOME extensions", and discusses it and the changes that have occurred in GNOME Shell. The new version of the extension works in GNOME 40, though alas it no longer works with older versions of the shell.

==== Ubuntu 21.10: Plan to do yourself an Indri? Here's what's inside... including a bit of GNOME schooling ====

Scott Gilbertson reports that Ubuntu 21.10 or "Impish Indri" is out, and reviews it with the mindset that it's a good "preview" of what Ubuntu 22.04 LTS may look like. A discussion on the way GNOME 40 works is given, and changes made from an operational viewpoint of the desktop, or how it's seen by Ubuntu users, and more. Details of what's included (5.13 kernel etc) , and some of the flavors (Kubuntu & Xubuntu) are also mentioned, before giving his conclusion that "Ubuntu 21.10 is well worth the upgrade".
