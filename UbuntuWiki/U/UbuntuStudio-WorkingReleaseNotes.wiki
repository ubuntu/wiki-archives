Pulse Audio/JACK integration
* This was noted on IRC and I thought it should be noted here as to be not forgotten and since I don't really understand what point needed to in the release notes I am including the preceding conversation:
** <persia> ScottL: In case anyone asks during nighttime on this side of the globe again, PA built against Jack is available, but qjackctl still disables PA on start.  There likely exists some way to untangle this, but I don't believe it's been done.
** <TheMuso> persia: The optimal way is jack2 and dbus to/from pulseaudio. That way, pulse only suspends access to the device jack wants. Whether it then can allow pulse to sit on top of jack in the same communication, I don't know.
** <crimsun> the pulse side isn't really up to snuff yet (Lennart posted about this a few months ago)
** <crimsun> perhaps [to add a hack] we could check the default sink and source from pactl stat and act accordingly with pasuspender in qjackctl
** <persia> I'm happy to wait for lucid+1 to sort this issue.
** <crimsun> yeah, I'd much rather release-note it for lucid

=== Ubuntu Studio Hardy 8.04 ===

Ubuntu Studio is a multimedia editing/creation flavor of Ubuntu, built for the
GNU/Linux audio, video, and graphics enthusiast or professional.

The Ubuntu Studio team is proud to announce its third release: Ubuntu Studio 
8.04. With this release, which you can download in a 1.1GB DVD, 
Ubuntu Studio offers a pre-made selection of packages, targeted at audio, video 
and graphics users. Ubuntu Studio greatly simplifies the creation of Linux-based
multimedia workstations.

For Ubuntu Studio 8.04 we have continued to update packages and fix critical bugs to 
better the Ubuntu Studio user experience.

We have developed a small application called "Ubuntu Studio Controls" to help with managing settings in
limits.conf like rtprio and memlock, which is useful for people working with
realtime JACK applications. It also contains the ability to enable firewire devices.

Effort has been taken to simplify the user interface in this release. We have
taken the design down to one panel and reduced the number of applets. There
are no desktop icons and the theme has been made into a Feisty/Gutsy hybrid:
much flatter but still retaining some dimension. We have also included 3 new
wallpapers that fit the audio, video and graphics themes. Compiz has also been 
included but is not enabled by default.

New applications included:
* Open Movie Editor (replaces PiTiVi)
* jaaa (JACK and ALSA Audio Analyser)
* Ubuntu Studio Controls
* PulseAudio
* gigedit (Gigasampler format instrument editor)
* mscore and the fluid-soundfont package
* Genpo

Features/Fixes/Improvements:
* Simplified UI. Art tweaks/updates.
* JACK Control with Pulse Audio wrapper.
* Compiz shipped but not enabled.
* System sounds fixed.
* Wrapper around jackd to stop/start PulseAudio when JACK is in use.
* Complete support for all languages as they are all on the disk.

Stuff To Mention:
* We have worked with Medibuntu (http://www.medibuntu.org) to provide the alsa-firmware package that is needed for many soundcards. It is in their Hardy repo.
* Set Control+F1 to launch gnome-system-monitor.
* OpenOffice has been removed.

See the Ubuntu release notes for other non Ubuntu Studio specific changes.

As our wiki page at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuStudio states, "our 
aim is to make it more accessible for new users to get into the tools that 
GNU/Linux has to offer for multimedia creation and production. We also want to 
spotlight what's out there, and show users tools they might not know to exist."
We feel this is our best release to date and have come even closer to providing the best system for multimedia creation.

Thanks to all who helped in Ubuntu Studio 8.04's creation!
