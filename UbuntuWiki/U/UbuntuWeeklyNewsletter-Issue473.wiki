Derrik Deiner from Make Tech Easier compare and contrasts about the two leading packaging software, Snappy , an Ubuntu based software developed by Canonical and Flatpaks, more of an open source version offering similar functionality.

Editorial comment from UWN staff: This article provides valuable information comparing the formats, but it is worthy to note that Snaps are not actually “hard-coded to use the Snap package store” run by Canonical as the article states, it is possible to run your own snap repository.
