=== Introduction ===

Kubuntu has a choice of office suite, KOffice 1.4 or OpenOffice.

=== Rationale ===

KOffice recently released 1.4, OpenOffice.org is about to release OpenOffice 2.  We should choose between them for the best office suite in Kubuntu.

Advantages of KOffice:

* Fast (starts up quickly)
* Less memory usage
* Well integrated (look and feel)
* Less disk space ~20MB compared to >100MB
* Includes database and drawing application
** Drawing application is needed by Kubuntu regardless, so using KOffice means one less package to look for elsewhere
** OOo Draw is not a bitmap program and so is not acceptable
** OOo Base does not work at all because Java is not present
* Doesn't need Java at all
* Compiles on all platforms

Advantages of OpenOffice:

* Better Microsoft files import
* Microsoft Office files export
* OpenOffice 2 has better KDE integration (but not perfect)
* Buttons don't fit on the toolbars, who designed this stuff?
* More stable than KOffice
* Expected by most users
** Mimics Microsoft Office, so switchers from Windows will find familiarity
* More features e.g. macros
* Easy conversion from other desktops

=== Implementation Plan ===

Set seed to include OpenOffice/KOffice [TODO delete as appropriate]
