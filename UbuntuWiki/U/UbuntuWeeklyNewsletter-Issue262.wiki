==== Code of Conduct Update ====

The Ubuntu Community Council has been working on a draft for version 2.0 of the Ubuntu Code of Conduct and has put out a call to the community for review and feedback. Feedback will be published on a wiki for public review, and discussion about it will take place at the public  Community Council meeting in #ubuntu-meeting on May 3rd.

==== Developer Advisory Team Report 12.04: Feedback from new contributors ====

The  Ubuntu Developer Advisory Team reached out to many new developers this development cycle and, as a part of that, “solicited feedback about our development process.” They have now published a report available in PDF or text and hope “that it will help drive further discussion about our development processes, tools, and documentation in the lead up to UDS and over the course of the next cycle.”

==== Jonathan Carter: iPads in Education and the Road Ahead for Edubuntu ====

Jonathan Carter talks about a new trend of educators using iPads as a means of helping students. He raises a concern as to whether such technology actually helps or hinders student success, and examines a common viewpoint from teachers that they are “magical devices that will do a lot of the teaching for them.” Jonathan considers how Edubuntu could be made even better for schools, and discusses how it’s time for an official Edubuntu device where teachers would be able to “choose which software, ebooks, courseware and other tools are installed on which device.”

==== Michael Hall: Ubuntu 12.04 is for App Developers ====

Michael Hall tells how Ubuntu 12.04 is catering to App Developers to make creating and distributing their applications as simple as possible. He talks about the developer portal, and how it can not only help developers get started writing their applications, but can also make packaging and distributing them a piece of cake. The goal is for Ubuntu 12.04 to be “a rich platform for app developers to target,” where the Ubuntu Software Center has “the means of delivering those apps directly to over 12 million users worldwide.” As you would expect with the communal spirit of the project, the community of app developers is a great place to communicate with, and gain helpful tips from, other developers, and will hopefully continue to grow through this LTS release and beyond.

Digital magazines like Ubuntu User and Linux Format are perhaps the most interesting items, given their new inclusion in the software center.
