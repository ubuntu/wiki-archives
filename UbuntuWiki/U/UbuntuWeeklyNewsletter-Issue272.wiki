==== 12.10 (Quantal Quetzal) Alpha 2 Released! ====

"Welcome to the Quantal Quetzal Alpha 2 image set, which will in time become the 12.10 release.

Pre-releases of Quantal Quetzal are *not* encouraged for anyone needing a stable system or anyone who is not comfortable running into occasional, even frequent breakage.  They are, however, recommended for Ubuntu developers and those who want to help in testing, reporting, and fixing bugs as we work towards getting this release ready.

Alpha 2 is the second in a series of milestone images that will be released throughout the Quantal development cycle, in addition to our daily development images.  The Alpha images are known to be reasonably free of showstopper CD build or installer bugs, while  representing a very recent snapshot of Quantal.  You can download  them here:

http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/quantal/alpha-2/ (Ubuntu Desktop, Server)"

More details, including links to the other images released for Alpha 2, available in the announcement here: https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel-announce/2012-June/000965.html
