==== Second Ubuntu Developer Week! ====

The second Ubuntu Developer Week will be held from Sept. 1st to Sept. 5th in #ubuntu-classroom on irc.freenode.net. There are Wiki docs, MOTU Videos, MOTU Interviews, and the developers are seeing more and more contributors each day. This is all great, but there’s nothing like talking to real people, and asking real questions in a real-time environment. The Ubuntu Developer Week is designed to give you an overview of what’s going on in the Ubuntu Developer world. Speak to the developers, learn, ask questions and finally realize: “It’s true, I can make a difference by helping out here."

A partial listing of some of the fantastic sessions are: Packaging 101, Upstream bug linkages, Introduction to MOTU, How do I fix and Ubuntu bug, Using Launchpad web service API, Updating a package properly, Introduction to PPAs, Ask Matt Zimmerman, and many, many more!

==== Intrepid Feature Freeze - Alpha 5 freeze ahead ====

The Feature Freeze is now in effect for Intrepid. From now until release, the focus is on polishing and bug fixing. If you do believe that a new package, a new upstream version of a package, or a new feature is needed for the release, and will not introduce more problems than it fixes, please follow the Freeze Exception Process by filing bugs and subscribing to ubuntu-release or motu-release as appropriate. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FreezeExceptionProcess

The next testing milestone, Intrepid Alpha 5, is scheduled for next Thursday, September 4th. Intrepid Alpha 5 will again use a "soft freeze" for main. This means that developers are asked to refrain from uploading packages between Tuesday and Thursday which don't bring us closer to releasing the alpha. These days can then be used for settling the archive and fixing any remaining show stoppers.

* The list of bugs targeted for alpha-5 can be found at: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/intrepid/+bugs?field.milestone%3Alist=1323

More information can be found at: https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel-announce/2008-August/000477.html

==== Call for testing of 2.6.27 kernel(Intrepid) ====

As you may have noticed, the kernel team moved to the 2.6.27 kernel in Intrepid this week. They would like to ask everyone to really give it a good testing to ensure they aren't introducing any major regressions from 2.6.26. If you have problems with this kernel, and the problem didn't exist in 2.6.26, please note that in any bug reports you file. https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel-announce/2008-August/000476.html

==== Xfce 4.6-beta is now available for Intrepid users ====

Ubuntu new Xubuntu developer, Michael Casadevall, has been working to package Xfce 4.6-beta (4.5.80) for Intrepid. He feels it has reached the point where its worth announcing an open beta test, both to find Xubuntu bugs, and any Xfce release issues. It has been a fairly massive rewrite of some major sections of Xfce, so now is a good time for a shakedown cruise to find any issues with this release, and work towards filing the bugs upstream. In addition, the team has used this opportunity to port some of the Xubuntu specific patches such as the unified logout screen.

It should be stressed that these packages are still extremely experimental, and are not recommended for day-to-day use yet, or by non-developers. If you are running Intrepid, you can install Xfce 4.6-beta by adding the following line to your sources.list: deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/xubuntu-dev/ubuntu intrepid main

==== Using identi.ca for Ubuntu information ====

Jorge Castro has written about the possibility of using identi.ca for Ubuntu related things.  First, in discussion with Mike Basinger, then with Nick Ali, Jorge has created the first of many to come identi.ca accounts at http://identi.ca/ubuntunews.  He has managed to include, by RSS feeds: The Fridge, QA/Brainstorm Blog, the Canonical Blog, Ubuntu website news, Ubuntu Screen casts, the Ubuntu-UK, and Fresh Ubuntu podcast feeds.  He would like your feedback on how useful the idea is. http://stompbox.typepad.com/blog/2008/08/using-identica.html

==== Ubucon El Salvador ====

Saturday September 6th the Ubuntu El Salvador Lo``Co team will be hosting an Ubucon at Universidad Evangelica de El Salvador from 9:00 AM to 2:15 PM local time. Ubucon is a community driven, community organized event that is all about Ubuntu. These events often include a number of speakers, BOF sessions, demos, social events and more, and they are excellent ways to grow the Ubuntu community in your area, and to build an interesting and fun event. Ubucons are different from large Linux expos and conferences. They are uniquely community focused and driven, and uniquely Ubuntu. http://www.fabianrodriguez.com/blog/archives/2008/08/27/ubucon-san-salvador-on-saturday-sept-6th-save-the-date/

=== Launchpad News ===

==== This week in Launchpad’s web API ====

Last week the Launchpad web service didn’t change because the source tree was frozen pending a Launchpad release. This week however, Launchpad landed the branches they wrote last week, as well as some new ones. Edwin Grubbs continued his work on publishing the Launchpad registry, and launchpad.projects is now open for business. You can now get basic information about Launchpad projects, their milestones and branches. Finally, launchpadlib has some new code that uses the client-side cache to avoid the “lost update problem.” This happens when two people modify the same object without coordinating, and the second one unknowingly overwrites the first person’s changes.

Next week there will be more of the Launchpad registry exposed, and some long-awaited aspects of Launchpad’s bug tracker. Then on Tuesday, Barry Warsaw and Leonard Richardson will be talking about Launchpad’s web service API as part of Ubuntu Developer Week. That’s at 1900 UTC, in #ubuntu-classroom on irc.freenode.net.

=== In The Press ===

* Dell's new low-end strategy for emerging markets includes Linux - Jacqueline Emigh of Beta``News reports that emerging markets are about to get some help. Dell has come up with 2 new desktops and 2 new laptops, loaded with Ubuntu, to meet the needs of governmental and educational organizations, and small businesses. These products will be available world-wide.  According to Kirk Schell of Dell's commercial products division, Dell's new Vostros for emerging markets have been specifically designed in accordance with customer requests for low cost, and easy of operation. http://www.betanews.com/article/Dells_new_lowend_strategy_for_emerging_markets_includes_Linux/1219962684

* Really free Linux takes hold - Bill Snyder, of Info``World, describes how a German television and radio station have switched to a community driven Linux distribution, rather than a commercially supported one for its servers.  Cutting costs was one factor, but a rise in internal expertise was just as important. Distributions like Ubuntu are gaining ground on the desktop, and could gain an edge in the server market soon. Snyder feels that this could be the beginning of a move toward community supported distributions. http://weblog.infoworld.com/tech-bottom-line/archives/2008/08/really_free_lin.html

=== In The Blogosphere ===

* Making Intrepid Solid - James Westby discusses how everyone can get involved and help prepare the next release of Ubuntu (Intrepid Ibex) for the October release. Those with the technical skills to troubleshoot problems that could result in a system not booting properly are encouraged to install Intrepid now, and report any bugs that they may experience. Triaging bugs is extremely helpful because it helps the developers focus their efforts on the more release-critical items. Everyone is encouraged to participate so that Intrepid Ibex is the best release of Ubuntu yet! http://jameswestby.net/weblog/ubuntu/02-making-intrepid-solid.html

* New Low-Cost Ubuntu Linux equipped Dell PCs and Laptops Arriving - On August 27th Dell announced the Vostro A100 and A180 desktop PCs, as well as the Vostro A840 and A860 laptops, which will come pre-installed with Ubuntu Hardy Heron. These systems are targeted for small business users in countries that until recently haven't had many PCs of these specs available. Customers in these countries are demanding affordable systems that are high-quality, and highly reliable. To deliver that affordable, high-quality, and highly reliable system, Dell turned to Ubuntu. Pricing has not yet been announced, but all of these computers will be available by early November. http://practical-tech.com/operating-system/new-low-cost-ubuntu-linux-equipped-dell-pcs-and-laptops-arriving

* Boosting the translation process - Blogger Syntux (aka Jad) has been involved with translations in Arabic.  He offers some opinions concerning why people would help out with translation, such as if they have passion for it, if they need it, if it’s fun doing it, or if they are making some money out of it. His reasons for analyzing the process is to find a way to increase the number of translators by making the process something that people would want to do. His analysis of the situation, and conclusion, can be seen at http://syntux.net/blog/2008/08/28/boosting-the-translation-process/

* Calling All Ubuntu Linux Users and Administrators – Works With U is offering an on-line survey in order to track the following: Does Ubuntu have an increasing and faithful installation base, momentum on both servers and desktops worldwide, VAR’s, integrators, and solution providers who could greatly increase deployments, and finally the fact that Ubuntu can be used for mission critical applications. Organizations who complete the survey will be included in the Works With U 1000 list and a report with be provided to all at no cost showing how Ubuntu is seeing increased use in specific markets, regions, etc.  http://www.workswithu.com/2008/08/27/calling-all-ubuntu-linux-users-and-administrators/

* 5 Factors Making Ubuntu Server Business Ready – Works With U shows that Canonical is becoming increasingly serious about the server market by developing essential core OS services and collaborating with 3rd providers for server applications. Listed in this article are five specific items that which demonstrate Canonical’s increased focus. First is the highly available and fault tolerant technology through backups, OS clustering, disk replication, data integrity, etc. Second are the central administration tools which include patch deployment, systems warnings, instance start-stop, etc. The third encompasses Ubuntu’s large community of experts. Fourth highlights green technology and the fact that Ubuntu can be run on a server without a GUI saving energy in large server farms deployments. Finally, Ubuntu server is becoming application-friendly given simple installation, comprehensive documentation, fanatical support and solid benchmark results. http://www.workswithu.com/2008/08/25/5-factors-making-ubuntu-server-business-ready/#more-222

==== Ubuntu Christian Edition 4.0 ====

Ubuntu Christian Edition is back, with Bible``Time and a bunch of resources for Bible``Time and Gnome``Sword.  Also, it's replaced Open``Office.org with GNOME Office to keep the ISO size down.  A new, cleaner website has also been created.  The distribution can be downloaded from http://mirror.oc.edu/lfc/Ubuntu_8.04_i386_Christian_Edition_v4.0.iso.  More information can be found at http://distrowatch.com/?newsid=05053

==== Post your Xfce news on reddit ====

While there are many sites devoted to news about Gnome and KDE, there's almost no way to get news about Xfce short of subscribing to the mailing list. The Xubuntu Blog hasn't posted a new article in a month. The Xfce Dev Blog hasn't posted in five months. And there's no Planet Xfce like there is a Planet Gnome or Planet KDE. At least, there wasn't. Now, however, there's an Xfce Reddit devoted to all news Xfce/Xubuntu. Of course, aggregators like Xfce Reddit only work if users submit news to them. So start submitting! http://www.reddit.com/r/xfce/
