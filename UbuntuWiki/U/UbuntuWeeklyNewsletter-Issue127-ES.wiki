==== Petición de pruebas para DRBD: Server Team ====

El DRBD se ha actualizado a su última versión en Jaunty. 8.3 y trae nuevas capacidades muy interesantes:

* soporte para dispositivos de más de 4 TBytes
* resincronización basada en "checksum" para acelerar los procesos de resincronizacióne en redes lentas.
* support for stacked resource
* Red``Hat cluster suite (rgmanager) integration scripts

Now that both the kernel module and the userspace tools have been updated DRBD is ready to be tested in Jaunty. Ante wrote up test instructions in a wiki page. Following his instructions and reporting the results is a great way to contribute to the Ubuntu Server team and help the shaping of the next release. If you’re already using DRBD in a specific environment and have access to a test setup, the Server Team would love to hear if this new version works well in your infrastructure. Let the team know of your findings at the next Ubuntu Server Team meeting or on our mailing list: ubuntu-server@lists.ubuntu.com.

=== LoCo News ===

==== Arizona LoCo Installfest ====

Arizona Lo``Co, in conjunction with the Phoenix Linux Users Group (PLUG), held an installfest on Saturday, January 31st at the University of Advancing Technology in Tempe. Wireless internet was no problem, plus the team had routers available to patch CAT5 cables into for those that didn't have wireless capability. The installfest took place in an upstairs room, so the team was able to hang their team banner off the guardrail with Velcro strips where it was highly visible to everyone entering the building. The team reported a fair turn out for installs, and lots of LUG folks attending to help if needed. Included by the team was a demonstration of Platinum Arts Sandbox on a Dell Mini 9. The event was a successful collaboration between the Lo``Co and PLUG, and everyone had a great time with lots of great inter-state cooperation between the team and the LUG's.

=== Launchpad News ===

==== Launchpad 2.2.1 released ====

The Launchpad team are proud to announce Launchpad 2.2.1, our first release of 2009!

In 2.2.1 Launchpad has introduced:

* a unique signature for each Personal Package Archive
* a way to introduce new translators to your team’s way of working
* an easier way for projects to export translations made in Launchpad.

Included at the link are details about:

* Signed PPA's (screencast: http://news.launchpad.net/ppa/adding-a-ppas-key-to-ubuntu)
* Help new translators find their way (Blog post: http://news.launchpad.net/translations/translations-style-guides)
* Upstream projects: (Help page: https://help.launchpad.net/PartialPOExport)
* Full details of 2.2.1 (Milestone page: https://launchpad.net/launchpad-project/+milestone/2.2.1)

http://news.launchpad.net/releases/launchpad-221-signed-ppas-and-easier-translation-exports-for-upstream-projects

==== Exporting translations upstream ====

Providing translation work back upstream is now greatly simplified!

There is a lot of translation work going on in Launchpad, for Ubuntu as well as for other projects. There is also a lot of translation work going on for the projects, that is not done in Launchpad. This is especially true for many of the Ubuntu packages that have their own translation effort “upstream”.

For various reasons, translations imported from upstream projects may be altered in Launchpad. One possible scenario is that an error is detected in the upstream translation with no time to fix that upstream and import again, because the next Ubuntu release is imminent. The Ubuntu translator will then fix it in Launchpad and Ubuntu will have the corrected version. But now it is a matter of good community citizenship to provide that change back upstream.

So far, the only option here was to either communicate the changes manually or to download the whole translation file and provide that to the upstream project. Unfortunately this may not be easy to merge into the upstream translations which may have progressed in the meantime. This step is now simplified by a new feature that only exports those translation strings from Launchpad that were changed from what was originally imported from upstream. This export also includes translations of strings that were not translated at all before.

You can find information about the feature on the help page: https://help.launchpad.net/Translations/PartialPOExport

It is hoped that this feature will find good use and that the upstream translations can profit much more from the translation work done in Launchpad. It is as easy as clicking on “export” and then forwarding the exported file to upstream.

Watch for more enhancements on the import/export front in the next releases.

==== 5 Things Mark Shuttleworth Has Learned about Organizational Change ====

Esther Schindler of CIO talked to Mark Shuttleworth, and he demonstrated how open source collaboration can improve the ability to innovate.
* The wisdom of the crowd - If everyone is going in the same direction, then no one stands out, and new ideas and optimization of ideas may fall by the wayside.
* It is necessary to harness both individualism and teams - Once one has the inspiration, it takes a team to be able to develop it.
* Tough times are good - With hard times, people look for more innovative ways of accomplishing things with less.
* Large changes are only possible when they have the potential to deliver radical improvements - Small changes won't cause people to want to change.  It takes large changes, radical improvements, to interest people in moving in a new direction.
* The earth from space is the most beautiful thing most people never get to see - Seeing the earth from space gives a new perspective on the need to cooperate with each other peacefully.

==== Sibyl Systems Selected as Solutions Partner for Ubuntu Linux ====

Sibyl Systems has discovered the stability offered by Ubuntu, and is happy to be selected as an Ubuntu Linux Solutions Partner to Canonical. "In the past we have been hard pressed in our ability to offer a stable and easy to use alternative to MS based software. The linux platform was not ready for prime time as they say, but with Ubuntu that has changed. Not only do you get a stable operating system, but you also get world class software comparable with anything MS has to offer." said John J Rice, president and lead engineer for Sibyl Systems.  http://www.pr.com/press-release/129640

==== Canonical Joins ARM Community ====

IQ Online reports that Canonical Ltd has joined the ARM Connected Community, the industry’s largest ecosystem for ARM technology-based products and services. Last autumn ARM and and Canonical Ltd confirmed that they are planning to bring the full Ubuntu Desktop operating system to the ARMv7 processor architecture, enabling new netbooks and hybrid computers. It will target energy-efficient ARM technology-based So``Cs, to deliver an always-connected, power efficient, mobile computing experience. This version of the Ubuntu Desktop operating system will target the ARMv7 architecture including ARM Cortex-A8 and ARM Cortex-A9 processor-based systems. http://www.arm.com/iqonline/news/partnernews/24205.html

=== In The Blogosphere ===

==== 36% of Ubuntu Users Seeking Mobile Internet Devices ====

Blogger Joe Panettieri of works with u give the results of their weekly pole about Ubuntu powered mobile internet devices (MIDs). According to the pole 36% of participants absolutely intend to buy Ubuntu MIDs. 45% might be interested in a MID purchase depending on features, functions and price. 19% of participants expect to purchase a smart phone or a netbook rather than an Ubuntu MID device. 106 works with u readers participated in the weekly poll. He then details what he believes are some of the challenges that Ubuntu powered MIDs are facing. He blames netbooks as a major contributer to the delay of an Ubuntu MID device. Mr Panettieri thinks the netbook craze, coupled with emerging platforms like Google Android, have limited Canonical's ability to drive interest in the MID concept. http://www.workswithu.com/2009/01/26/36-of-ubuntu-users-seeking-mobile-internet-devices/

==== Keith Tokash and Ubuntu ====

Blogger Keith Tokash describes his experience with switching from Windows XP on his work laptop to Ubuntu 8.04 Hardy Heron. He covers programs and functionality that he needs and wants to have on his computer. One thing that he really liked is that almost all of this software was installed by default. His experience in switching from Windows XP to Ubuntu 8.04 has not been all positive, but overall he's incredibly glad he did it. He used to hate his entire computing experience, now he just hates his email client. What he really wanted to express in writing this article is that while you may have a mixed experience making this switch, it's entirely possible to do so. You don't have to be a Linux expert, or even a Linux power user, to jump ship anymore, so go for it.  http://www.ccieflyer.com/2009-Feb-KTokash-Ubuntu.php

==== [Detux] 2 Years of Ubuntu ====

It’s almost 2 years since this blogger freed himself of Microsoft’s propriety, OS and he's even converted his wife (though she occasionally falls back onto MS Office when Open``Office just doesn’t quite do it the way she wants). He's still using Ubuntu, despite playing around with other distros. He's found himself coming back just because of the great support forums and hardware support. With the added ability of being able to create a USB Live Disc, he was able to convert several machines including a Samsung NC10. http://abandonallfear.org.uk/2009/01/30/detux-2-years-of-ubuntu/

=== In Other News ===

==== Ubuntu pocket guide and reference book ====

Keir Thomas is pleased to announce that his new book, Ubuntu Pocket Guide and Reference, is now available. It's a compact yet comprehensive guide to all aspects of day-to-day Ubuntu use.

Keir's book make be purchased online from Amazon.com for a recession-busting $9.94. It's approximately 5x8 inches and 166 pages (ISBN 978-1440478291).

Uniquely, the PDF Edition of the book is available entirely free of charge from http://www.ubuntupocketguide.com. What's more, people are encouraged to share the PDF Edition file with friends, and even upload it to file-sharing networks. The PDF Edition is exactly the same as the Print Edition.

Since the website went live about 48 hours ago, the PDF Edition has been downloaded over 100,000 times. This makes it the world's most widely-read Ubuntu book (at least according to Nielsen book-sale figures), and possibly the most widely read Linux book of all time.

==== Ubuntu Nokia Experiment(a community project) ====

Joey Stanford tells us that despite the insurgence of Android phones, he still sees a large amount of Nokia phones (and Nokia employees) at developer summits and conferences. He has created the grass roots Ubuntu Nokia Users team in Launchpad complete with a recommended set of software for Nokia devices. This is an open group, anyone may join, and is not an Canonical project. This experiment (and team) has two aims:

* Self-Help: Helping users connect to their Nokia devices (phones and tablets) in Ubuntu and getting the most out of their experience as well as discussions about how to get Ubuntu onto Nokia devices.
* Comradeship: A social experiment to connect Ubuntu users with Nokia devices together.

Stanford also hopes that this experiment will draw in some developers to improve the experience of using Nokia devices in, and using, Ubuntu.  There is already an existing community-led  Ubuntu Nokia Development group if you are interested.

=== Meeting Summaries ===

==== Technical Board Meeting ====

* Welcome Colin Watson - Colin Watson joined as the newest member of the Ubuntu Technical Board, his membership in the Launchpad group and to the Mailing List have been confirmed.
* Verify outstanding ubuntu-core-dev applications - Daniel Holbach confirmed that there were no outstanding ubuntu-core-dev applications for the TB to consider, and that there was one pending in the MOTU Council queue awaiting further information according to their new process.
* Calendar follow-up - The Ubuntu News Team have, as requested, switched to Google Calendar for the fridge and documented the procedure for adding meetings to it. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Fridge/Calendar.  The TB meeting has been added to this calendar.
* Per-package uploader proposal - Emmet Hikory proposed a set of criteria for reviewing per-package uploaders.  The proposal is quoted verbatim here, however please note that this was not approved in the meeting.  The discussion was fairly long and quite constructive; the general consensus was that per-package upload rights do not waive the requirements of Ubuntu Membership. It was felt that a prospective candidate must still have shown a significant and sustained contribution to Ubuntu (albeit for a single package), and that the candidate must still be socially integrated with the larger development team.  Emmet Hikory will review the meeting log and redraft the proposal according to the discussion. The current candidates will remain on hold until the criteria have been approved.
* Archive reorg update -
** The notion of restricted layers has been added to the spec
** Sections on how the ogre model will work and on some anticipated community factors have been added
** The proposed ability to give permissions has been changed around to match current consensus

 The permissions has one rather curious feature it has a "core" layer, which remains necessary for the ogre model and for partial mirrors but the permissions on the "core" layer are simply "Ubuntu [generalist] developers", the same as for all packages in no layers.

 Next steps:
** prepare rough set of requirements for the Soyuz Team, including transition plan
** work on an example layer archive to be published on people.ubuntu.com for development of APT, etc.

==== Server Team: January 2009 ====

Mail services:

* dkim was added during the Intrepid release cycle. Work keeps being done by Scott Kitterman to keep the milter support up-to-date: dkim-milter, pymilter, pymilter-milters have been updated to the latest upstream version in Jaunty.

Virtualisation:

* Soren Hansen has uploaded a new version of the libvirt package. Amongst bug fixes the version available in Jaunty brings support for openvz. A patch to support opennebula has also been added but is not enabled yet. The related tool virt-viewer has also been updated and provides a Mozilla plugin package. The tools used to interact with EC2 have been updated to the latest version released by Amazon while the latest version of virtualbox-ose made its way to the Jaunty archive. The 2.1 version brings better support for 64 bit systems as well as full VMDK/VHD support including snapshots.

Collaboration tools:

* moinmoin has been updated to a new major version. The 1.8 version brings in a major GUI editor upgrade, a new theme in addition to the usual round of bug fixes.

Databases:

* MySQL 5.0.75 is available in main while MySQL 5.1.30 is in universe. Some more work is still needed to make the latter fully working. One of the new feature provided by MySQL 5.1 is the embedded server library. libmysqld is already used by the new version of the Amarok music player shipped by the Kubuntu team in Jaunty.

Clustering support:

redhat-cluster has been updated to the latest alpha2 release of the 3.0 branch. This soon-to-be-stable third generation of the code includes a new conga interface - the graphical tool to manage clusters. Related dependencies such as openais and corosync have also been updated.

Screen-profiles:

* Multiple uploads include the work done by Dustin Kirkland and Nicolas Barcet. After some discussions on the ubuntu-server mailing the default escape sequence has been changed back to ctrl-a. A few scripts have also been added to provide more information: a memory count script and a load average script. The common key bindings are using the F-keys to ensure that they work in both gnome-terminal and the tty console. A screen-profile-helper has been added to allow the selection of profiles as well as to install screen by default.

Squid proxy:

* The default configuration has been updated to better support apt repository caching: the cached object size has been increased so that big packages are properly cached. The Release and the Package file are also kept for a longer period of time.

Tomcat6:

* The tomcat6 package has seen the addition of a webapp auto-deployment feature to handle application load and unloads. One of the consequence is that installing webapp packages doesn’t stop tomcat6 processes anymore.

Uncomplicated Firewall:

* The 0.26 version has seen the addition of a new REJECT functionality. debconf questions have also been added to enable the firewall and set some basic rules. This is the first step towards integration of ufw in the installer.
