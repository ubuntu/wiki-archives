==== Zabbix + IoT/Snappy: allows users to feel the pulse of things ====

Sergey Sorokin, Director of Business Development at Zabbix, writes about how the open source monitoring system, Zabbix, can be coupled with Ubuntu Core on Internet of Things (IoT) devices. “Zabbix brought a tiny, resource efficient agent to reside on top of any device; whether it is a smart house sensor, vending machine, electronic device, or anything else. This agent can collect device performance, availability and status data, as well as other useful application metrics and it can communicate this information with other devices or to the cloud – thus creating true synergy between the things of the IoT.”

==== Why the Ubuntu developer portal moved to DjangoCMS ====

Michael Hall shares with Open``Source.com the rationale behind moving the Ubuntu developer portal from Word``Press to DjangoCMS, including ease of building additional components, high availability considerations, and community interaction. He writes that of the content management systems surveyed, there "was no perfect solution, we found that DjangoCMS stood out from the rest" and that it has "proven to be just the right balance of simplicity, flexibility, and power."

==== This IKEA Table Has Ubuntu-Powered Multitouch PC Inside ====

Silviu Stahie, writing for Softpedia, tells us about a small and inexpensive coffee table modified to be a Touch Coffee Table that runs Ubuntu GNOME 15.04. He lists the items that were used to build the table which include a Dell P2314T multi-touch monitor, and says: "It's not the sort of stuff you might imagine needing, but it's likely that once you had an Ubuntu-powered coffee table, you won't be able to go back to a regular one."

==== Take a Look Inside Cirrus7 Nimbini, the Most Beautiful Ubuntu Mini PC ====

Silviu Stahie of Softpedia takes a look at the Cirrus7 Nimbini mini PC that ships with either Ubuntu 14.04 LTS or 15.04 and comes in three versions with different hardware specifications. He says that the case is built from many aluminium layers which ensures that it doesn't need any fans or mechanical heat dissipation methods. Silviu also links to the website from where further information about the PC can be found.

==== Is there spyware in Ubuntu? Answered. ====

Dedoimedo looks back at a blog post in which the writer said that as Canonical's Jane Silber was previously involved in intelligence and information gathering, Ubuntu has been compromised. He shows us how we can prove that this is not true by taking the source code, compiling it, and comparing to the Ubuntu binaries. In his conclusion, Dedoimedo says: "Thousands of engineers, scientists and highly experienced system administrators run Ubuntu daily. And yet for some reason, despite rigorous IT practices, network security and whatnot, all of them are dumbasses and not one of them has been able to find any trace of Ubuntu backdoor stuff, and yet a casual blogger has all the mighty data in his hands."

==== Eurocom Releases Linux Edition Of Its M4 Ultraportable Notebook ====

Rob Williams of Eurocom reports that Eurocom have released a Linux edition of its M4 Ultraportable notebook which includes a 3200x1800 resolution screen, 8GB of memory, a 500GB hard drive, and 802.11b/g/n Wi``Fi. He says that the online configurator doesn't currently list Ubuntu as an option but the press release does, and that as a Linux fan: "I  am glad to see more and more companies push the OS on their laptops."
