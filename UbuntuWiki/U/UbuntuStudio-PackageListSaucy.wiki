<nowiki>[[UbuntuStudio-WorkflowCategories]]</nowiki> - A place to list all of the Ubuntu Studio workflow subcategories

== How to create these tables ==

Copy the text, including all the packages from any of the sections in http://packages.ubuntu.com/saucy/ , for instance http://packages.ubuntu.com/saucy/sound/. 

Paste into a file. Add an empty line at the beginning of the file (next command is buggy otherwise). Run this command to create a wiki table out of it:

<pre>
cat <oldfile> | sed 's/^ */|| /g' | sed 's/([^ ]*)/||/1' | sed '$!N;s/\n/ /' | sed 's/$/  ||  ||  ||/' > <newfile>
</pre>

It's not working perfectly yet, but it's workable..
