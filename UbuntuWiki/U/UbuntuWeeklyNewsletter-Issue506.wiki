==== Alan Pope: April Snapcraft Docs Day ====

Alan Pope announces the next Snapcraft Docs Day on April 28th with a “Flavours” theme, encouraging the community to provide Snap feedback specific to different Ubuntu distributions. Links to participate are included in the article.

http://popey.com/blog/posts/april-snapcraft-docs-day.html 

==== Xubuntu: Xubuntu Quality Assurance team is spreading out ====

The Xubuntu team writes about upcoming changes to the team’s management. They write, “Today, we’re pleased to announce that Dave will be carrying on as a team lead. However, starting with the artfully named Artful Aardvark cycle, we will migrate to a Quality Assurance team with two leads who will be sharing duties during development cycles.” They write about what happened last cycle, and what they would like to come out of these changes.

https://xubuntu.org/news/xubuntu-quality-assurance-team-spreading-out/ 

==== Canonical Design Team: Designing in the open ====

Canonical Design Team explains their process for integrating design changes in GitHub. By adding a separate “Issue” for a design, the project gains increased transparency of a work in progress and enables feedback from anyone subscribed to the project. 

https://design.canonical.com/2017/04/designing-in-the-open/

==== Kubuntu General News: KDE PIM update now available for Zesty Zapus 17.04 ====

The Kubuntu Team writes about the availability of the latest KDE PIM stack in PPAs. They write, “As explained in our call for testing post, we missed by a whisker getting updated PIM 16.12.3 (kontact, kmail, akregator, kgpg etc..) into Zesty for release day, and we believe it is important that our users have access to this significant update. Therefore packages for PIM 16.12.3 release are now available in the Kubuntu backports PPAs.” [sic] They give instructions for installing the new packages and how to report any issues.

http://www.kubuntu.org/news/kde-pim-update-now-available-for-zesty-zapus-17-04/

==== Alan Pope: OpenSpades Snap - pew pew ====

Alan Pope writes about a game he recently snapped, which operating systems he tested it on, and how to install it. He notes, “I also had to disable EAX (positional audio) because it crashes OpenAL on the i386 builds. Players on AMD64 systems can of course just re-enable this, as it's only the default I set, not permanently off. I might modify this default so it's only disabled on i386 builds in future.” He encourages users to let him know of any issues that may arise.
