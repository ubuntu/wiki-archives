=== LoCo News ===

==== Planet Ubuntu Ireland – Lets get chatting ====

We are redoing the ubuntu-ie website here for the Irish team. We have our own planet and there are many members; it would be great to add more of your blogs on here. You don't have to post about Ubuntu; post about you, what you do, and what projects you're working on. We’re a community and we should get to know our community. You don't have to be currently based in Ireland; lots of us expats want to get in touch and keep up to date with one another.

==== Vancouver's Natty U-Party! ====

Last Friday evening, Vancouver threw a party in celebration of Ubuntu and Unity. We call our parties "U-Party" to appeal to everyone, not just Ubuntu users.  Over the course of the next few days I will be sharing some of the highlights (at least the ones that I'm allowed to share). I will also share some of the ideas that helped make this party special.

More information can be found at: http://randall.executiv.es/uparty-n-1

==== Ubuntu-ie and Canonical Meet up in Dublin ====

Next week some of the folks that work in Canonical from Launchpad and the Platform team  will be in Dublin on a sprint. The Irish Lo``Co is having a pub meet up to say hello to some of them.  Everyone is welcome to drop in and say hi. It’d be nice to put the names to the faces and well meet the folks who do such a great job on Ubuntu!

More information can be found at: http://www.lczajkowski.com/2011/06/22/ubuntu-ie-and-canonical-meet-up-in-dublin/

==== The World Needs To Hear You ====

Ubuntu Community Week is your chance to learn about how Ubuntu communities and Lo``Co teams work. It's also your chance to showcase the great work your Ubuntu group is doing to help people find Ubuntu, to grow your community, and to make events even more awesome!  We have a few slots lefts for presenters, but not many! So, if you have a good Ubuntu story to tell please head on over to the UCW wiki page and nominate yourself to spread your wisdom.

==== Hello, World! ====

This is the first of our official Ubuntu Lo``Co Council blog posts.  We’ll be doing all sorts of fun community-based posts, updates, and news.  We may all be reached on the Lo``Co Mailing List, “loco-council” <loco-council@lists.ubuntu.com>. Keep in mind that we do moderate it, so please don’t worry about the bounce message!  We can also be found on IRC, in Freenode/#ubuntu-locoteams. If you would like to ping us, please just ask the bot! All you have to do is say “!lococouncil”, and we get the ping.

=== Launchpad News ===

==== Consistent display of tangential links ====

On Launchpad there are a lot of links that take your focus away from the current task. Usually, these exist to let you get more information on Launchpad or take you off Launchpad to do something like look at upstream information.  These links are usually represented one of two ways–a blue link with a globe for something that takes you to a new website, or a blue or green link for an internal link that opens a new window.  Everyone’s been bitten by clicking a link while in the process of filling out a form and losing the data they’ve spend five minutes filling out.  There is a survey put together showing some rough ideas of how to indicate a link that opens in a new window. It’s a very short survey, and the Launchpad team would love to get your input.

More information can be found at: http://blog.launchpad.net/general/consistent-display-of-tangential-links

==== Launchpad meet-up Dublin ====

There is going to be a Launchpad meet-up in Dublin next Wednesday (29th June) from 8pm at the Porterhouse on Nassau Street.  Come and meet some of the Canonical Launchpad team, a few other Canonical types and members of the Ubuntu Irish Lo``Co.

More information can be found at: http://blog.launchpad.net/general/launchpad-meet-up-dublin

==== Knowing who the user is in Launchpad ====

The Launchpad team is testing changes to the person picker used on many pages in Launchpad. The general goal is to ensure that you can trust you know who the user you are seeing is.  The listing of users shows the unique-name. IRC nicknames were added, since it was common for users to search on them. Those who are active in the project you are working with are shown with the project’s badge to the right of their name. There will be cases where you want to see more details about the user before choosing, so the listing includes a link to see the user’s profile.  Person picker defects are being tracked with the person-picker tag.

==== Victor Tuson Palau: Ubuntu Certification: What components do we test? ====

Victor Palau tells more about certification. Certification is a generic level of functionality to be expected for hardware running on an Ubuntu Release. Part of the challenge is to identify what hardware components should be included in the test. The aim is to cover all widely accepted components, while excluding fringe ones that may only be of interest to a small set of the user base. In the past it has been a bit hard to understand what components were tested for Certification and this has lead to questions like “Why is the finger reader scan not working in this certified system?” when the answer is simply that certification does not test for finger-reading functionality.
