=== Summary ===

Making Launchpad maximally usable to search engines will increase exposure of Launchpad pages to developer eyeballs. There are four main issues: making useful pages indexed, making useless pages not indexed, preventing link spam, and removing the appearance of link spam. All these problems can be solved or minimized with technical means.
