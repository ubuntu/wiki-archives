==== Xubuntu 16.10 Yakkety Yak - A breath of fresh air ====

Dedoimedo reviews the latest release of Xubuntu, 16.10 Yakkety Yak. They evaluate several aspects, including various parts of the Live Session, the installation and package updates, default applications and customization. As part of the conclusion, they write: “It would seem that Xubuntu is recovering gently. Perhaps it is still too early to tell, but Yak is much, much better than Xerus. And it deserves 8/10.”

==== Ubuntu Releases IoT Core Platform ====

Jack M. Germain of Linux``Insider takes a look at the recently released Ubuntu Core 16 which uses Ubuntu’s snap packages to ensure that Internet of Things [IoT] applications access only necessary data. In his summary he writes: “The new Ubuntu Core delivers confined security with read-only, tamper-proof application images. They are digitally signed. That adds a critical importance to the integrity of IoT devices.”

==== Applications Missing From Ubuntu ====

Matt Hartley, writing for Datamation, runs through some applications that are missing from Ubuntu such as Microsoft Word, Adobe Photoshop and Quick``Books.
