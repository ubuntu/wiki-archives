=== To Enable rtirq ===

To enable the rtirq script (package name rtirq-init), the kernel needs to be booted with the ''threadirqs'' argument. For this to work, the kernel needs to have been built with '''CONFIG_IRQ_FORCED_THREADING=y''' (which is done on both linux-lowlatency and linux-generic).

To enable ''threadirqs'' on a kernel by default, it can be built with the config options '''CONFIG_CMDLINE_BOOL=y''' and '''CONFIG_CMDLINE="threadirqs"'''.

To boot with the ''threadirqs'', an easy way to add it to the boot parameters for GRUB is to add the argument in /etc/default/grub and edit the line '''GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=""''' to read '''GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="threadirqs".'''

If wanting to try a newer version of the script, or updating the current one, the files of interest are /etc/default/rtirq (configuration), and /etc/init.d/rtirq (the actual script).
