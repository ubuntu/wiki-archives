__TOC__


In WartyWarthog, multiple independent hardware detection systems were used:

* The installer (debian-installer) uses discover1 to load kernel modules
* The installed system uses hotplug to load kernel modules, with some assistance from debian-installer via /etc/modules where hotplug support is not yet available
* The live CD uses Knoppix hardware detection tools and methods to load kernel modules and configure the X server
* The xserver-xfree86 package uses discover1 and custom scripts to configure the X server

For HoaryHedgehog, we will reduce this duplication, because it hampers maintenance and improvements to hardware detection.

* The installer, the installed system and the live CD will standardize on hotplug to load kernel modules
* The live CD will use xserver-xfree86's configuration infrastructure to configure the X server

What about using discover2 for the detection of new hardware that hotplug does not detect?

We would rather improve hotplug, as it seems to be the right way forward.
