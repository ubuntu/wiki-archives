==== Introducing Metal as a Service: provisioning for the hyperscale era ====

On April 4th Mark Shuttleworth announced the new Metal as a Service (MAAS) in this blog post, explaining:

“As we move from “tens” to “hundreds” to “thousands” of nodes in a typical data centre we need new tools and practices. This hyperscale story – of hyper-dense racks with wimpy nodes – is the big shift in the physical world which matches the equally big shift to cloud computing in the virtualised world. Ubuntu’s popularity in the cloud comes in part from being leaner, faster, more agile. And MAAS – Metal as a Service – is bringing that agility back to the physical world for hyperscale deployments.”

He shares further ideas behind MAAS, which makes “it easy to set up the hardware on which to deploy any service that needs to scale up and down dynamically.”

==== Ubuntu Server is No Longer the Best OS for Cloud Computing. ====

Robbie Williamson makes the case for why the Ubuntu Cloud release is a better option than Ubuntu Server for cloud computing with Ubuntu. He explains why scaling-out is better than scaling-up and looks at the complexity of management that scale brings.

http://undacuvabrutha.wordpress.com/2012/04/04/ubuntu-server-is-no-longer-the-best-os-for-cloud-computing/

==== Kicking the tires on MAAS ====

Jorge Castro shares step-by-step instructions for how users can test out the new Metal as a Service infrastructure with as few as 3 boxes for testing, and details for how to give feedback.

=== In The Press ===

==== Shuttleworth defends Ubuntu's Linux contributions ====

Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols of ZDNet reports on the recent report by Linux.com on top contributors to the Linux kernel, noting that Canonical is not in the list of top 20 contributors. He shares excerpts from emails with Mark Shuttleworth defending Canonical’s Linux contributions explaining, among other things, that “ the kernel is a tiny part of the user experience of Ubuntu, and we don’t lead kernel development as a particular goal” and that they do lead with “tools that make Linux a fantastic environment for developers, system administrators and end-users alike”

http://www.zdnet.com/blog/open-source/shuttleworth-defends-ubuntus-linux-contributions/10726

==== New Canonical Tool Tackles 'Hyperscale' Data Centers ====

Rick Whiting of CRN covers the release of the Metal-as-a-Service (MAAS) provisioning and management tool. Whiting writes “Businesses and cloud service providers today are wrestling with what some are calling "hyperscale" data centers running tightly packed racks of thousands of nodes, especially those running ARM and Atom CPUs.” The post includes excerpts from an interview with Mark Shuttleworth where the tool is discussed.

http://www.crn.com/news/applications-os/232800273/new-canonical-tool-tackles-hyperscale-data-centers.htm

==== This Wild Visionary Wants To Turn His Linux Company Into The Next Apple ====

Julie Bort of Business Insider compares some of the goals, actions and relationships that Canonical has with users and vendors with those of Apple. Among those comparisons include the “new Apple-like user interface” (Unity), Ubuntu One service which mixes the ideas of iTunes and iCloud, Ubuntu TV, Ubuntu for Android to market to phones and Ubuntu tablets. Bort ends by quoting from Mark Shuttleworth who “sees his role as making Linux more popular.”

http://www.businessinsider.com/mark-shuttleworth-turning-ubuntu-into-the-next-apple-2012-4

==== Ubuntu in South African Schools ====

Andrew Craucamp writing for My``Broadband.co.za News makes a case for using Ubuntu and other open source software in South Africa, rather than the current proprietary options. His reasons include recognised open standards that Ubuntu abides by, ability to run it on older machines without additional antivirus software, and freedom of licensing. The article concludes that Ubuntu is “ a natural fit for a modern South African youth.”

=== In The Blogosphere ===

==== New Ubuntu Print Test for 12.04 LTS ====

==== 5 problems with Ubuntu 12.04 part 1: Unity Dash usability issues ====

Russell Barnes of Linux User discusses his view of what would happen to a prospective Windows user experiencing Ubuntu 12.04. The fictitious character Wendy Windows encounters five problems in this article including the following: "At first glance she doesn’t see the Lens icons at the bottom of the window at all, but even if she did would she recognise which represents applications? Should she take her chances she would eventually be met by a list of applications, but it needs to be expanded and cycled through before she’ll get the result she’s looking for."

==== Why Ubuntu Is Not Contributing To Linux, Or Is It? ====

Swapnil Bhartiya of Muktware discusses some of the contributions to Linux being made by Ubuntu and Canonical. Bhartiya begins by discussing the low percentage of kernel changes submitted by Canonical, and takes the discussion beyond the raw numbers presented in these contributions. He shares discussions around the development that has been done in making Linux more accessible “among the masses” and contributions to other open source projects.

==== My interview with Andy Woodhead, aka ActionParsnip. ====
