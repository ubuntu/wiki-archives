Computing is for everyone, so GNOME has a fully featured accessibility platform included.

A good page of information about it is <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Accessibility/doc/Guide | in the Ubuntu community pages.]]</nowiki>

== Setting Up Universal Access ==
From the GNOME shell, search for '''Universal Access'''.

From here, you can pick your settings. See <nowiki>[[#Included_Features | Included Features]]</nowiki> for a complete list of settings that are available.

== Included Features ==
In '''Universal Access''', you can select from four categories of assistance:
# '''Seeing'''
# '''Hearing'''
# '''Typing'''
# '''Pointing and Clicking'''

== Installing with Universal Access ==
* To install Ubuntu GNOME with universal access settings enabled, press any key while the disc is loading.  This will bring you to the following screen, where you will select your language.
