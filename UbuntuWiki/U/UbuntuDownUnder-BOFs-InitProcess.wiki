=== Introduction ===

Coordinate various changes to the init process.

=== Rationale ===

The DependencyInit and UdevRaces specifications both describe extensive changes to the system init process, and many of the potential changes overlap. For instance, network service startup could be implemented either using dependencies or using `dev.d` scripts. It would be advantageous to coordinate these changes in advance to make sure each package is modified in the most effective way.

=== Scope and Use Cases ===

=== Implementation Plan ===

==== Data Preservation and Migration ====

==== Packages Affected ====

==== User Interface Requirements ====

=== Outstanding Issues ===
