=== Summary ===

Change the X display manager such that the flip from the usplash VT to the X VT is not performed until the login screen is ready.

=== Rationale ===

=== Use cases ===

=== Scope ===

=== Design ===

=== Implementation ===

==== Code ====

==== Data preservation and migration ====

=== Unresolved issues ===

* X saves the existing mode and uses that when returning to text consoles. If the console is still in a graphical mode when X is started, it will return to a graphical mode when the user presses ctrl+alt+F1. This will prevent the text consoles from working.

=== BoF agenda and discussion ===
