==== Help Testing Translations in the New Natty Language Packs ====

The next set of translations for Ubuntu 11.04 "Natty Narwhal" are now ready.  Please help test them.  Also please take special care to test the localization of Firefox since there are changes in how Firefox handles translations.  Please ask your teams to test them and provide an indication that they've done so by following some simple steps and submitting a signoff.

More information can be found at: http://ubuntu-news.org/2011/06/14/help-testing-translations-in-the-new-natty-language-packs

==== Unity Contributor Report for 14 June ====

We've got a bunch of new rockstars since the last status report from 11.04 including Daniel van Vugt, Marius Gedminas, Manuel Nicetto, Jeremy Bicha, Nico van der Walt, and Cameron Heart.  Some of the more familiar names like Marco Biscaro, Oliver Sauder, and Andrea Azzarone have also been awesome at fixing bugs.  To contribute to Unity, follow the Step by Step Instructions and Wiki Page. This will get the code from Launchpad, set up your development environment, and getting you used to the Launchpad workflow.  Then, pick a bug, fix the bug, and get your code into Unity.  Join the ~unity-community-hackers team and start digging in.  There is now a Weekly Meeting at 000UTC on #ayatana on Freenode IRC if you feel like hanging with us and getting organized and ask questions.

==== Ubuntu 11.10 Development Update ====

Daniel Holbach writes about a busy week about Oneiric development.  Oneiric is still in the development phase, where most of the heavy lifting is being done and where things are still broken. He goes on to say that its still a great time to get involved and fix a few issues early on.  Interesting dates coming up in the next few weeks include dh_python2 porting jam on June 23rd and Ubuntu Developer Week coming up from July 11th to 15th.  A week full of development tutorials, workshops and interactive sessions.  This week, we hear about Abhinav Upadhyay from India and his experience about getting fixes into Ubuntu.

=== LoCo News ===

==== Zamboanga City Natty Release Party ====

The Philippine Lo``Co Team will hold two Natty Narwhal Release Parties this June 24, one in Manila and other in Zamboanga City. This will allow the team to maximize efforts and exposure by serving 2 out of 3 island groups. The Zamboanga City event is organized by Yolynne Media and will be hosted by ELearning Centre, Inc. Visit http://ubuntu-ph.org/ for more infomation.

More information can be found at: http://blog.knightlust.com/2011/06/zamboanga-city-natty-release-party/

==== Better Late than Never – Natty Release Party [Philippines] ====

The folks in the Philippines will kick off June 2011 with Natty Narwhal Release Party. If you’re in the Greater Manila Area and itching to meet up with fellow Ubuntu users, join the party and share your Ubuntu stories over pizza and a bottle of beer (or cup of coffee) on June 24.

==== Michigan LoCo sponsorship of MUG ====

Recently, the Ubuntu Michigan LoCo took over Michigan!/usr/group (MUG) for a night.  Recently, MUG started a sponsorship program targeted at companies. A company can choose to sponsor a meeting for $150 where their sponsorship will be recognized and all of their employees will be full members for the year. The Michigan Lo``Co put out a call to raise funds to sponsor a meeting and we blasted past the $150 amount and ended up donating $185 to MUG.  There were 6 awesome talks by amazing members of the LoCo team. There will be videos of the event posted later.

==== LoCo Team Directory Translation Updates ====

The Lo``Co Team Portal team is working on finalizing updates to the Lo``Co Team Directory to push out a new release in the next week. There have been many changes to the translation strings for the Lo``Co Team Directory. The team would appreciate it if translators could take a look and update any translation strings that need to be updated prior to then. There could be a secondary release a few days or a week after the initial release if there are enough translations done after that would warrant an update.  There are some changes coming up this cycle to the Lo``Co Team Directory that will create a fair amount of new strings that will need to be translated. Please file bugs on any strings that could be worded differently to make translations easier.

==== San Francisco Ubuntu Hour and Bay Area Debian Dinner ====

The San Francisco Ubuntu Hour and Bay Area Debian dinners in June landed on Wednesday the 8th, which was also World IPv6 Day. There were 7 people at the 6PM Ubuntu Hour at The Roastery on New Montgomery. The conversation included how Ubuntu syncs packages from Debian, the exciting work of the new DEX team and various Ubuntu tidbits.  The Debian dinner began at 7PM over at Henry’s Hunan Restaurant on Natoma Street, just across the alley from The Roastery. It was the biggest dinner since November, bringing in 10 people, including 2 Debian Developers (thanks again for coming Devin and Jonathan!).

=== Launchpad News ===

==== Farewell, Jonathan ====

==== Visualizing Ubuntu Differences Against Debian ====

Over the past few months, Launchpad's Red Squad have been working to make it easier to create and manage derivative distributions in Launchpad.  They have recently released a beta of a new feature that lets you visualize the differences between Ubuntu's Oneiric series and Debian Sid.  There is a new portlet on the distroseries page that will list the numbers of packages in both distributions, numbers only in Sid and numbers only in Oneiric. Clicking on the links takes you to pages that show the differences in more detail and allows you to request debdiffs and add comments on the packages.  Bugs on this feature are tracked using the 'derivation' bug tag. Note that this is not meant to be a replacement for MoM – yet.

==== Using visibility for rudimentary JavaScript templating ====

When designing pages to work with-and-without Java``Script enabled, then you’ll likely be tempted to repeat some of the user-interface text in the template and in the Java``Script file. Especially for text that appears only some of the time.  One alternative is to render that text all the time, and only show it some of the time. In Launchpad, you add the "unseen" class to text in order to hide it.  In YUI3, it’s easy to add or remove classes using Node.toggle``Class().  This adds the 'unseen' class to foo when baz is true, and removes it when baz is false.  If the page needs to have more than one instance of the text, this approach doesn't directly apply. However, it’s easy to imagine extending it by using a hidden copy as a prototype and copying it as needed.

They think that Ubuntu would be the next big popular thing for them to look at.  Requests are primarily coming from web hosters in Europe.
