'''Launchpad Blueprint Link:''' https://blueprints.launchpad.net/loco+/+spec/launchpad-event-registration

=== Detailed Outline ===
The Ubuntu LoCo teams are looking a way to follow up on an event promotion; tracking attendance, gathering support for the event, keeping track of past events, meetings etc.

Currently this is all done in a wiki and does not follow any specific way of organizing the attendees as every team has a different way of doing this and this can be a way or inhibiting new comers. Also, there is no way of letting all the team members know about the event, as not all members are on mailing lists.

==== Issues ====

Laura is organising a meet up to celebrate a release party. She does not know how many people are coming so she can chose a suitable venue.  Currently it is by mailing list or wiki post, making it very difficult for her to track who is coming. 

Efrain wants to attend the event laura is promoting but there is a list of attendees on the wiki but Efrain does not know wiki mark up, so he cannot edit the wiki entry and add his name.

Jono wants to know what each LoCo has organized at any given point, this is currently easy to track at fixed event times, but not for individual events at any given point.

Laura would like to have an efficient way of email notification. She depends on mailing lists to ensure the email arrives to all inteand members.  Each members options may slow down reception of the information for the event.

== Proposed Solution == 

An slightly different implementation of the Sprint/meeting that is currently available in Launchpad would definitely fit the current need with the exception with a couple of fields such as organizing LoCo and being part of a bigger event organized by a bigger group such as a BugJam.

==== Use Cases ====

Efrain runs a BugJam he has registered an event, and he has already let his LoCo team know about the event by associating the BugJam to his LoCo team.

Laura has received an email from Launchpad with a suggestion on an event she would like t attend based on LoCo team affiliations. 

Laura has created an event and wants to know how many people are attending or not.
