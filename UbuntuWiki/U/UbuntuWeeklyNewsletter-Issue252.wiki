==== Ubuntu Global Jam: Call For Events! ====

Ubuntu Global Jam (UGJ) will take place from 02-04 March 2012. UGJ is a call to action for Ubuntu users to organize and participate in a local event designed to be fun and improve Ubuntu at the same time. Anyone is able to contribute to their local UGJ event and everyone is welcome and encouraged to get involved.

http://www.jonobacon.org/2012/02/07/ubuntu-global-jam-call-for-events-2/

==== Ubuntu 12.04 Development update ====

In his latest Ubuntu 12.04 development update, Daniel Holbach highlights the Alpha 2 release, encourages users to test this release, and reminds the community that Feature Freeze is Friday, 17 February 2012.

Events in this update cover Ubuntu Global Jam to be held on 02-04 February, 2012, and Holbach links to a video to help get people started with organizing a local Global Jam.

As usual this update includes a list of items that still need to be accomplished, how first timers can get involved, and who to contact.

This update also includes interviews from various Kubuntu developers who look at where this distribution stands and its future.

==== Remixing Ubuntu for the Enterprise Desktop ====

Mark Shuttleworth announced the release of the Ubuntu Desktop Business Remix which is based on Ubuntu 11.10.  The difference in this release over other Ubuntu releases is that Canonical tailors the Ubuntu Desktop Business Remix for enterprise environments.  There is a special EULA (End User License Agreement) to sign before this can be used due to proprietary software additions like VMWare and others.

==== Jonathan Riddell: Kubuntu Status ====

Jonathan Riddell, the sole paid developer of the Kubuntu project at Canonical, announced that Canonical will no longer offer financial support for the project after the 12.04 release. Canonical will offer infrastructure support in the same way as the other community flavors such as Edubuntu, Lubuntu, and Xubuntu, but future development will rely on the strength of the community.

==== Philip Ballew: We are Ubuntu: My interview with Mike Holstein ====

Philip Ballew talks to  Ubuntu``Studio, NC Lo``Co, and community contributor, Mike Holstein in this ‘Were are Ubuntu’ interview series.  Holstein lets readers know what he does outside the Ubuntu Community--he’s a musician--, what areas of Ubuntu he helps in as well as how this helps the Ubuntu community.  He also answers why he uses Ubuntu, what inspired him to join the Ubuntu community, what else he would like to help with, as well as what he brings to the Ubuntu to make it better.

==== Chris Coulson: Why Ubuntu is not using the Firefox ESR ====

Chris Coulson of the Ubuntu Desktop Team explains why Ubuntu is not using the Firefox Extended Support Release (ESR) in the upcoming Ubuntu 12.04 LTS release.

Coulson looks at the arguments both for and against using Firefox ESR  and concludes his post with, “It is entirely possible that we might provide a Firefox ESR build for people who are managing large deployments of Ubuntu, although the details of this aren’t decided yet. However, this isn’t going to be the default browser for our LTS. If it existed, it would be shipped in a PPA (much like we have been doing for the Firefox Stable PPA), and we would have to be clear to users that it wouldn’t receive the same level of support we give to the regular Firefox versions.”

==== Canonical Design Team: Ubuntu sound theme design ====

==== Jeremy Bicha: Ubuntu Classic, Now With Indicators ====

Jeremy Bicha thanks Jason Conti (for the patch) and Ted Gould (for the merge) as he announces that indicators have now been ported to gnome-panel 3.  Bicha says the themeing is a broken, but that should get fixed in the coming weeks and notes that patches are welcome.

He also admits that the Classic desktop in 11.04 had issues but now he’d be happy to recommend 12.04 to “fans” of the GNOME 2 style.

=== In The Press ===

==== Will Unity win the battle of the Linux desktop? ====

Brian Proffitt, ITWorld, writes about the fragmentation of Linux desktop environments. In this article Proffitt notes, there aren’t single environments anymore, but desktops using common technologies. He also describes, with references from User Experience (UX) experts, why Canonical can (and should) win the Linux desktop battle.

http://www.itworld.com/it-managementstrategy/247574/will-unity-win-battle-linux-desktop

==== A tale of two distros: Ubuntu and Linux Mint ====

Terry Relph-Knight, ZDNet, says, “Regardless of operating system, the user experience is always mediated through the user interface, or UI. Since Mint is based on Ubuntu, comparisons between the two OSs for desktop use come down almost entirely to the UI.”

In this article Relph-Knight compares and contrasts Ubuntu and Linux Mint using screencasts and summaries to highlight the UI experience.

==== “We’re Going to be Building Awesome Things” – Ubuntu TV Interview with Canonical’s Will Cooke ====

Will Cooke, Engineering Manager for the Product Strategy Team at Canonical, sheds some light on what he thinks will contribute to the development of Ubuntu TV and the ultimate, simple TV experience. Cooke’s “love for the telly” mixed with Canonical’s recruiting strategy for the best developers and designers promises “awesome things” in store for Ubuntu TV. The community response has been amazing so far, and will continue to drive the success of the project with help from Jono Bacon’s “Experience Teams” idea. Decisions regarding aspects of the design and hardware specifications will be kept in-house, but will stay focused on simplicity in an attempt to bringing back the lean-back experience to TV.

==== No More Dodge Windows in Unity? Global Menu to Become Optional in Ubuntu 12.04? ====

Manual Jose, Tech Drive In, looks at the option of the Global Menu in the Ubuntu 12.04 LTS release.  Jose looks at both the Ubuntu Design Team mailing list and comments posted by Mark Shuttleworth in Google+ thread to a post by Alan Pope [Product Strategy Team, Canonical].

“...Global Menu is kind of useless and sometimes even irritating. Now, we will have to wait and see if these proposed changes are going to arrive in Ubuntu 12.04 Precise Pangolin release itself,” say Jose in conclusion.
