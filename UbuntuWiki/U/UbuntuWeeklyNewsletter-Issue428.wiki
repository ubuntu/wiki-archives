==== Dustin Kirkland: Appellation of Origin: FROM ubuntu ====

Dustin Kirkland responds to concerns about the use of Ubuntu in Docker images, writing: “I am speaking for my employer, Canonical, when I say you are not violating our policies if you use Ubuntu with Docker in sensible, secure ways.  Some have claimed otherwise, but that’s simply sensationalist and untrue.” He goes on to explain in further detail how Ubuntu can be used in Docker and how to go about working with Canonical if any permission for usage is required, concluding: “Believe it or not, we’re really quite reasonable people!  Canonical has a lengthy, public track record, donating infrastructure and resources to many derivative Ubuntu distributions. Moreover, we’ve successfully contracted mutually beneficial distribution agreements with numerous organizations and enterprises. The result is happy users and happy companies.”

==== Launchpad News: Improved filtering options for Gmail users ====

Colin Watson writes that some email clients including Gmail have a problem filtering email from Launchpad effectively. He says that a new option is available on the Launchpad personal details page to include filtering information in email footers, and shows us how Gmail users should set up their filters to read this information.

==== Nicholas Skaggs: Opportunity: Automated Installer Testing ====

Nicholas Skaggs reports that after some of the automated tests stopped working, a community member discovered that the CI team within Canonical can no longer run these tests. As such, Daniel Chapman and Daniel Kessel have been involved with handling tests and getting a community-driven test infrastructure up, but they need help. He concludes his post by saying that diverse skills are needed and asks “Are you interested in helping make flavors better? Do you have some technical skills in writing tests, the web, python, or running a jenkins server? Or perhaps you are willing to learn? If so, please get in touch!”

==== Ubuntu GNOME: Help needed to test 14.04.3 ====

Ali Linx appeals on behalf of the Ubuntu GNOME team for help testing 14.04.3 which is due for release on 6th August 2015. He provides links to the testing tracker, the new testing procedures, and concludes his post with: “As always, your endless help and continuous support are highly appreciated.”
