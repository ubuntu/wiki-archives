==== Riccardo Padovani: Ubuntu Phone seen by my friends ====

Riccardo Padovani shares some feedback he’s received from his university friends who aren’t studying tech and “know about Ubuntu only because [he is] involved.” Positives include fluidity and ability to multitask, but he noted the lack of the Whats``App application and a confusing unlock screen as some weaknesses. He concludes “I’m more than happy with the results: Ubuntu Phone seems ready for all, and this is a good point where we could start to build. We have simply to continue on that way, and we will change the world, bit by bit, mind by mind.”

Christmas gift, and Happy Holidays, New Year 2015 and beyond to you and yours."

The Forums Council informs us that they have decided to mentor a group of Super Moderators who will have access to the Administrator Control Panel. They say: "With the advent of the SSO login, we’ve found that more and more time is spent just trying to help people log into and use the forums. The only way to actually deal with these issues is from the Administrator Control Panel."

==== Ubuntu Phone User: Manager at Braum's ====

When taking his son out for ice cream on his birthday Ted Gould, wearing an Ubuntu hat reports that he was asked about Ubuntu. The manager of the ice cream shop Braum’s asked a few questions about Ubuntu, as he was using it on his desktop and had installed it on his phone for full time use. He said, describing his favorite feature, "I love how much it's the same as the computer version. I'm trying to get a business off the ground, have four kids and I have to keep this place running. I don't have time to keep a different model of how two things work."
