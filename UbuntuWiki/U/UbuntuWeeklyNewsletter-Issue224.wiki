==== Ubuntu 11.10 Oneiric Ocelot Alpha 2 Review, Screenshots, Download Links ====

Manuel Jose from Tech Drive-In blog reviews the new Oneiric Ocelot Alpha 2 release. He notes that although the system in general became snappier, it nevertheless collected few annoying bugs as well. Two of these problems seem to be around keyboard handling, as trivial key combinations behaved for Manuel in a wrong way.

Additionally, Manuel mentions some of the new software packages and software versions in the new Alpha release, such as Gnome 3, Thunderbird and LightDM.

==== David Baucum: Features needed in Thunderbird to replace Evolution ====

David argues in his post, that while "Evolution has a very solid feature set, and great usability and integration, its just some nasty quirks that pop-up from time to time that keep it back". He notes, that changing the email client altogether might be too drastic, but also possibly inevitable in this case.

He also reviews Thunderbird, which is to be the default email client in Oneiric Ocelot. He points out that while Gmail integration was quite easy and straightforward, there's no calendaring application by default, and while Lightning plugins provides that, there's no easily configured synchronization with Google Calendars. In addition, he reviews other features in Thunderbird and explains what features need to be integrated, in his opinion, to make Thunderbird viable replacement option for Evolution.
