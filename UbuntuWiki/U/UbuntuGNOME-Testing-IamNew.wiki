== Important Notes ==
Testing and using Development Releases of Ubuntu GNOME (or any other flavor of Ubuntu) isn't meant to be for production machines of daily usage. Testing is to make sure the Stable Release is working as good as possible. Find Bugs, Improve Performance, etc - this is what we do until we finalize the testing process and release a stable version. Whenever you are testing, keep in mind few notes:

# Make sure to <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BackupYourSystem | Backup]]</nowiki> your '''important data'''. If you are using Linux, the best and easier way is to make a copy of your '''/home''' folder or partition. If you want to do a full system backup, please see <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BackupYourSystem | Backup Your System]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[http://www.howtogeek.com/108869/how-to-back-up-ubuntu-the-easy-way-with-dj-dup/ | this link too]]</nowiki>.
# You can use <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine | Virtual Machines]]</nowiki> - for example <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VirtualMachines | See this]]</nowiki>. You can use USB Drives or External HDD. You can use your machine. That is totally up to you but please, refer to #1 :)
# Using a Development Release is not suitable for daily production machine.
# The more you break your installation, the better. That is why, to play it safe, better to use Virtual Machines, Spare Testing Machines and/or USB Drives, specially with Alpha 1 and Alpha 2. Beta Releases are a bit more stable but still under heavy development.
# '''The most important part of testing is to actually install the system and check how the installation process will work'''. This is very important. Please, do a fresh new install - you can either <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ZsyncCdImage | zsync]]</nowiki> your ISO or download again.
# Finally, always remember: '''Better Safe Than Sorry''' :)
