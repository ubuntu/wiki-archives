==== Final Freeze for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) ====

The Final Freeze for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) occurred this past Thursday in preparation for the release on Thursday, April 17th.

Adam Conrad writes about some exceptions to the freeze and concludes: "And don't forget kids, this one's an LTS.  It's the release you'll install for your friends, family, and work networks and then promptly forget about for two years because it's just that awesome.  At least, it should be.  So, if it's not, let's make sure we sort that out."
