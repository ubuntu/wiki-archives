== Intro ==
=== What is Quickly? ===
* https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Quickly
* Application templating system
* Boiler plate
* Commands
* Integration with infrastructure
* Opinionated choices
* shell completion
* Easy and fun

=== Quickly in Karmic ===
* 0.2.5
* First iteration of quickly and ubuntu-project template
* Only one template
* PPA support is there, but a bit brittle
* $quickly tutorial up to date

=== Quickly in Lucid ===
* 0.4.0
* Second iteration with 2 or 3 templates
* ubuntu-application, ubuntu-cli, maybe ubuntu-arcade
* $quickly tutorial not up to date yet

=== Installing Quickly ===
* $sudo apt-get install quickly
* Lots of dependencies, so a slightly large download
* Sets up lots of useful tools

== Creating your app ==
* 0.2.5: quickly create ubuntu-project appname
* 0.4:  * quickly create ubuntu-application appname
* Creates a working application

=== naming ===
* In 0.2.5/karmic, only support for one work names
* In 0.4.0/Lucid, support for multi-work names

== Editing the UI ==
* Code files and glade files linked by naming
* automatially hooked up for you

=== Glade Command ===
* within project directory
* 0.2.5 $quickly glade
* 0.4.0 $quickly design (support non-gnome templates)
* Must use this command, project won't work otherwise

=== Glade Tips and Tricks ===
* Fill tool-like interacton
* Selecting in the inspector
* layout via boxes, VBoxes and HBoxes
* Changing position in a Box
* pack_start, pack_end
* Fill and expand control sizing, auto layout on window resizing
* Border and padding control spacing 
* Use stock items when possible
* add dialogs with the "dialog" command
** 0.2.5: $quickly dialog dialogname 
** .4: $quickly add dialog dialogname
** import the dialog
** use New*Dialog()
d = New*Dialog()
response = d.run()
if response == gtk.RESPONSE_OK:
# do your stuff

=== Signals ===
* In glade on signal tab
* for buttons, use both clicked and activated
* for menus, just activated
* writing signal handlers
def handlername(self, widget, data=None):
### do your stuff
### widget is the sender

== Writing Code ==
* finish_inishializing versus __init__()

== Debugging and Testing ==
=== print statements ===
* most common and easiest
* leaves print statements in code, need to be deleted

=== Logging ===
* won't cause debug output to be printed in normal run
* a bit broken at the moment

=== debugger ===
* pdb is a command line debugger, works well, but is a bit hard to use
* there are graphical debuggers built into some IDEs

== Packaging ==
* For sharing apps via email, or dropping a file somewhere
* quite forgiving

=== setting up your app for packaging ===
* add your name and email to the copyright file
* issue license command
* Edit *.desktop.in to define category
* add author, email, description, long description to setup.py
* $quickly package

=== Creating a deb ===
* $quickly package
* try it out

== PPAs ==
* a bit less forgiving than package
* create ssh keys as per launchpad instructions (will need for release)
* create pgp keys as per launchpad instructions
** Don't use a comment!
** set DEBEMAIL and DEBFULLNAME in .bashrc, the same as what was in your gpg key
** match gpg --list-secret-keys
export DEBEMAIL=rick.spencer@canonical.com
export DEBFULLNAME=Rick Spencer

* Create a PPA
** for 0.2.5 call it only "ppa", nothing else will work
** 0.4.0 will allow you to choose a ppa 
* To release, you need to create a project in launchpad
* $quickly share - puts latest in your ppa
* $quickly release - does the same but also increments version and makes an announcement
