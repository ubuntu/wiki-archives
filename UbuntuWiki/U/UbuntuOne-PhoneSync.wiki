__TOC__

NOTE: As of June 1, 2011 the current Ubuntu One contacts sync for mobile will no longer be active. We’re stopping support for our current service so we can focus our energy on launching a much better service sooner than we could otherwise.

== Contacts phone sync, public alpha ==

For questions about the service, see <nowiki>[[UbuntuOne-PhoneSync-FAQ]]</nowiki>

==== Set up your phone ====
===== Instructions =====
* Go to: https://one.ubuntu.com/phones/ (if the link is down, check our <nowiki>[[http://twitter.com/ubuntuone|twitter status]]</nowiki>)
* Select your phone model. If the model isn't listed, but you know it works, then proceed. We will give you a username and password to authenticate your phone with your Ubuntu One account.
** iPhone and Android phones can download the app directly from their respective app stores (web links for Android available at <nowiki>[[http://www.cyrket.com/p/android/com.funambol.androidsync/|Cyrket]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[http://www.appbrain.com/app/com.funambol.androidsync|AppBrain]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[http://code.google.com/p/funambol/|Google project site]]</nowiki>).
* '''Don't''' configure calender/notes sync or anything else that isn't contacts, no matter what the instructions tell you to do
* If your phone doesn't support syncml, download the client from here: https://www.forge.funambol.org/download/
* The host is: '''http://syncml.one.ubuntu.com'''
* DB name: '''card'''

===== Model gotchas =====
* iPhones, download the Ubuntu One app from the Apple app store
* Android phones, only 2.0x models are supported. Download the app from the Android Marketplace. 

==== Resetting your contacts ====

|-
| Do they seem to have all the correct data?
| I added a contact with an international phone number to Evolution. The contact synced file to the webui but the contact did not have the phone number when I synced my phone.
|-
| Other observations
| Seems to be some sync strangeness when switching the type of email from 'other' to 'work'. Sometimes the sync causes it to switch back to 'other' even though I've changed it to 'work' in Evolution. The iPhone has a phone type of "iPhone". Assigned phone numbers to this type are not displayed in the webui. Editing a contact in the webui adds values (blank) to empty address fields. Recreate by adding a new contact on your phone (just phone # and no addresses). Sync. Edit the phone # in the webui. Save. Sync. Contact on phone now has blank address values.

|-
| Can you see all your contacts on the web ui?
| Started with all contacts in Web UI (loaded via evolution) & empty phone contact list, loaded into ubuntu one from evolution
|-
| Do they seem to have all the correct data?
| Web UI almost. The Sync from evolution to ubuntu one contacts has put the Job Title field from the Evolution Contact into the contact Name Title field, giving contacts with job titles the wrong name.  Phone contacts are incorrect.  Addresses are being created that aren't in the Web UI (SyncML record contains them even though they don't exist on the contact & ubuntu one iphone app creates them in the phone contact).  Phone numbers are not being created in most cases, although it looks like if a contact record has multiple phone numbers, the second one does get created.

|-
| Do they seem to have all the correct data?
| no... data is not appearing in the correct fields.  Most significantly, Home Phone is appearing as Mobile on the iPhone and Mobile Phone isn't appearing at all.  Home email address is appearing as Other email.  Work Phone isn't appearing at all either.  On the whole, these issues make the app unusable in the current form, the Mobile # not appearing being the most significant issue.
