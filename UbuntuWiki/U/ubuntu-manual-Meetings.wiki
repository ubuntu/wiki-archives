==== Authors Due Date ====
The Ubuntu Manual Team has set September 19th, 2013 as the due date for all authors to complete changes to the Ubuntu manual. If you have not started authoring, please do so now! If you have completed authoring, please contact the editors of your section. Our goal is to complete all the sections BEFORE the due date so as to give the editors plenty of time to complete their task.
