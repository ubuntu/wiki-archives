==== Yakkety Yak Alpha 1 Released ====

On behalf of Ubuntu Release Team, Martin Wimpress and Simon Quigley announce the release of Alpha 16.10. Alpha 1 includes a range of updates that are ready for testing for the following flavors: Lubuntu, Ubuntu MATE and Ubuntu Kylin. They explain that while the images have been tested to confirm they generally work, it is quite an early set of images, so you should expect it to be buggy. Ubuntu developers are continuing to improve the Yakkety Yak release as the cycle goes on.
