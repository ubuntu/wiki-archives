==== Ubuntu on Windows — The Ubuntu Userspace for Windows Developers ====

Dustin Kirkland writes about news announced at the Microsoft Build 2016 conference, the Windows 10 feature which provides the ability to run Ubuntu natively. Dustin confirms, "An Ubuntu user space and bash shell, running natively in a Windows 10 cmd.exe console!" He also gives a short tutorial on how to do it, answers some questions that might come up, and ends by stating, "From Microsoft’s perspective, a variety of surveys and user studies have pointed to bash and Linux tools – very specifically, Ubuntu – be available in Windows, and without resource-heavy full virtualization."

==== Xubuntu: The Small and the Noisy ====

The Xubuntu team writes that they have prepared some tidbits for its blog to make waiting for the upcoming 16.04 LTS release more enjoyable, reporting that will publish articles in two different series. One series covers the fact that that Xubuntu 16.04 LTS will not come with a default media manager, and invites team members to discuss their favorite media players. In the second article series, the Xubuntu team will present smaller details to help you use your system with ease.

http://xubuntu.org/news/small-and-noisy/

==== Xubuntu: My media manager: Clementine ====

The Xubuntu team begins their series of discussions with team members leading up to the Xubuntu 16.04 LTS release where there will no longer be a default media manager. In this installment of an ongoing series, Xubuntu team members Kev and Daniel talk about using Clementine and the features and reasons they’ve selected it as their media manager.

http://xubuntu.org/news/my-media-manager-clementine/

==== Stéphane Graber: LXD 2.0: Image management [5/12] ====

Stéphane Graber publishes his fifth installment about LXD 2.0. This article discusses how LXD manages images, and how to create your own. He states "with LXD, we’re taking this one step further by being all-in on the image based workflow." "All containers are created from an image and we have advanced image caching and preloading support in LXD to keep the image store up to date,” he stated. He goes on to explain "The ability to have the exact same image easily available bit for bit on a bunch of globally distributed system is a big step up from the old LXC days and leads the way to more reproducible infrastructure."

https://www.stgraber.org/2016/03/30/lxd-2-0-image-management-512/

==== Didier Roche: Ubuntu Make 16.03 features Eclipse JEE, Intellij EAP, Kotlin and a bunch of fixes! ====

==== Dustin Kirkland: Still have questions about Bash and Ubuntu on Windows? ====

The Xubuntu team gives us some tips about some of the smaller details in Xubuntu, stating, "In this series the Xubuntu team present some of the smaller details in Xubuntu to help you use your system more efficiently. Several of the features covered in this series are new for those who will be upgrading from 14.04 LTS to 16.04 LTS. We will also cover some features that have been in Xubuntu for longer, for those that are completely new to the operating system." The first article shows us how to modify the theme colors and the second one shows menu editing.

* Ubuntu 16.04 beta now available for LinuxONE - https://insights.ubuntu.com/2016/03/29/technology-preview-of-ubuntu-server-now-available-for-linuxone/

=== In The Press ===

==== Go nuts, brother: Ubuntu 16.04 beta – no more auto data-spaffing ====

Scott Gilbertson of The Register writes that Xenial Xerus is the first significant update to the Ubuntu desktop in two years, due to the status as an LTS release (Long Term Support). He explains that Ubuntu 16.04 LTS will not just set the framework for all the next releases for the following two years, it will enjoy full support and updates until 2021. "There's still a few weeks to go," Gilbertson writes, "and this beta definitely has some rough edges, but Ubuntu 16.04 is shaping up to be an excellent release, particularly from an LTS stability standpoint. LTS releases always have to find a balance between incorporating the best of what's new with the need to support those features and apps for five years."
