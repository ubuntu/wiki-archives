== Help and Support Etiquette ==
<nowiki>[[File:favicon.ico]]</nowiki>

Dedicated volunteers create the software you use, and other dedicated volunteers give their time to help you learn how to use it. In time, you will be able to "Pay It Forward", and help others on their journey.

All the Ubuntus provide personal support in mailing lists, chat rooms, and their Forums.  However, you will soon discover that people are more likely to help you if you've done research before asking your questions.  Many of your questions will be frequently asked questions (FAQs,) and those FAQs can be found simply in uDuck. 

Please do the best you can to try and solve your problems with uDuck, first, before asking the friendly support people. (Clue: If nobody answers you right away, you might wonder if your question is a FAQ.)
