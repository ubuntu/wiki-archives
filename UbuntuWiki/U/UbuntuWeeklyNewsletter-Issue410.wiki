Michael Larabel of Phoronix reports that on most tests Ubuntu 15.04 and Fedora 21 surpass OS X 10.10. The one outlier is the Xonotic v0.7 test where Fedora 21 is slightly below OS X 10.10 but Ubuntu 15.04 pass them by with a extra 10 fps (frames per second).

==== The Most Common, Annoying Issue When Benchmarking Ubuntu On Many Systems ====

Phoronix writer Michael Larabel reports that GRUB is the most common issue when benchmarking on Ubuntu. When there is a power problem (ex. machine’s power is cut) or the system is just left in a non favorable state when booting. This causes the system to need the user to select a kernel to boot, on a headless system this can only be fixed with hooking up a monitor and keyboard.
