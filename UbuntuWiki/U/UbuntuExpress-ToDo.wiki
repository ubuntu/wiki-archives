__TOC__

== UbuntuExpress to-do list ==

'''This page is here to aid cooperative development. Please do not edit this page (other than wiki gardening) unless you are an Espresso developer or have explicit permission from an Espresso developer. Bug reports do not belong here.'''

* do something better than the current mountpoint selector
* combine partman and partman_commit so that we don't have to start up the partitioner again (not urgent)
* UI polishing:
** keymap screen needs a good polishing
** probably more
* fix up various untranslatable strings
* Add a "hardware clock is in local time" checkbox to timezone selector that sets "UTC=no", and otherwise DTRT.

=== braindump from UI sprint ===

* picture on left-hand side depicting stage of installation
* max dimensions: 700x500 (?)
* language:
** make better use of empty screen space
* location:
** not clear that you don't have to hit the timezone point first time
** more explanatory text at the top of the timezone page
** zoom out on leaving map area?
** if zooming out on leaving map area, zoom out more slowly
** reduce number of alignment points
* keymap
** make better use of empty screen space
* identification:
** password error causes page to jump around
* advanced partitioning:
** get rid of operations window entirely
** some way to change existing filesystem
** really really want mountpoint here if possible
** otherwise do what we can
* summary
** bevel text box (ColinWatson: changing xthickness/ythickness seems to be excessively hard in pygtk)

=== deferred ===

* language:
** use horizontally-scrolling tabular list view (too hard to do in GTK at the moment)
* keymap:
** use horizontally-scrolling tabular list view (as with language)
* identification:
** once passwords are same length, display inline error on mismatch (difficult while using user-setup validation)

=== done ===

* API shake-up to allow debconffiltered coprocesses to run asynchronously
* actually run debconffiltered coprocesses asynchronously so UI works smoothly
* missing UI steps:
** language
** keymap
** location/timezone (need to evaluate existing code, e.g. Evolution timezone widget)
** "ready to install" summary
* infer country from timezone
* reconfigure locale according to selected country
* language pack support
* automatic partitioning was broken
* include partitioning commit in main installation progress bar
* change partman control flow (including in d-i, probably) to better support <nowiki>[[UbuntuExpress/PartitioningTool|proposed multiple-disk UI]]</nowiki> (FabioMassimoDiNitto)
* sort out espresso-grub trying to install grub from the network
* yaboot installation
* move copy/configuration code to a separate debconffiltered process to avoid progress bar code duplication and so that it runs asynchronously without messing around with threads
* use apt-setup to generate standard sources.list?
* copy network configuration
* UI polishing:
** separate windows for installation progress bar and farewell text
** use a dialog from partman/confirm* instead of the weird "confirm automatic partitioning" checkbox
** tell the user he needs to be root for the installer to work (if started as non-root)
** back button doesn't always work properly
** summary page needs to have Install not Forward
** username/password/hostname screen needs sprucing up
** autopartitioning screen is a quick hack, redo once partman lets us do better
** replace breadcrumbs with "Step x of y" in bottom left corner (DanielSilverstone)
** excise remaining Spanish strings
* add glue to make preseeding work
* sort out localisation in general
* general gparted cleanup (DanielSilverstone)

=== KDE Frontend Done ===

* Map Widget (based off kworldmapclock)
* qt parted should return a list of partitions and their formats
* qt parted should apply when clicking Next
* qt parted UI simplifying (remove left hand side, replace with drop down box of disks)
* BUG: two progress dialogues appear
* Resize partition option (waiting on GTK frontend first)
* fix up various untranslatable strings
* disable back/next buttons when busy and show a busy cursor

=== done (from UI sprint) ===

* horizontal rule above dialog action area
* locale:
** move locale select box into main body of page
** more conventional background colour for locale page
* keymap:
** add typing-test region to keymap page
** move keymap page after location selection
* location:
** button to allow changing current time (with time-admin)
** current time should use LC_TIME
** first click should be a magnifying glass?
** border around map
** UTC -> GMT
** UTC-8.5 => GMT-8:30
** "Adjust..." -> "Set Time..."
** remove justification text from bottom, add text to top something like "Select a city in your country and time zone"
** "Nearest city" => "Best city"
** show selected country
* identification:
** "Who are you?"
** restore hostname question ("Computer name") - short hostname only (no standard for where to put longer name)
** cut password field down to 12 characters
** run laptop-detect, "username-desktop" / "username-laptop" as default hostname
* advanced partitioning:
** "Prepare partitions"
** move explanatory text to bottom
* mountpoints
** needs format checkbox
** "Format?" -> "Reformat?"
** grey out "Reformat?" if no filesystem on partition
** check Reformat? by default for /, /usr, /var, maybe /boot?
* summary
** ditch expander and "Details"
** border between text and edge of box
** use standard dialog background (gtk.Label.set_selectable(True))
* install bar
** madly wrong copying time
** better indications that it's doing something at various points
* final page
** needs better wording
** reboot needs to switch VC (gdmflexiserver)
