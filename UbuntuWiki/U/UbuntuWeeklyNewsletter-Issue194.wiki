==== Ubuntu Mentioned on CBS's The Big Bang Theory ====

There have been several people in the community who have pointed to Sheldon mentioning his favorite Linux OS in an episode of CBS's The Big Bang Theory.

If you haven't seen the clip you can now go to: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1-Q_8EbB8A

==== Audio from UDS Sessions Now Available ====

The crew at UDS have put the audio recordings from the sessions on-line.

http://uds.ubuntu.com/audio/uds-m has the audio files in Ogg Vorbis format for download. There are separate sub-directories for each day from Monday through Friday, and the files are timestamped and named based on the rooms that sessions happened in.

==== Why Launchpad Rocks ====

Jono Bacon, the Opportunistic Developer, tells the community why Launchpad rocks. In this article Jono describes the opportunistic developer as well as what he has tried before and the balance launchpad offers other opportunistic developers.

Jono states, "I feel Launchpad gets the right balance. It doesn’t overflow you with meaningless features that you will never use, but instead provides a well designed set of core tools that I have used for pretty much all of my projects."  He goes on to list those features which include:

* Bug Tracking – a place to file bugs, triage them, attach fixes to them and manage them.
* Code Hosting – a place to store and view your code and manage those branches.
* Translations – a place where non-developers can contribute translations to your program.
* Package Building – a place to build packages for Ubuntu and deliver them to users.
* Specification Tracking – a place to plan features to be used in projects.
* Community Support – a place where questions can be asked and answered.

In reference to the above listed features, Jono had the following to say, "My projects use all of these features and this is most of what I need in a development forge, with the only additional features that could be nice being a wiki and possibly a testing tracker. Not only does Launchpad give me enough of what I need to be productive, but it also integrates all of these components. As an example, branches in the code hosting component can be attached to bugs in the bug tracker."

Also, in this May 21st, post Jono, talks about his plans to "spurt a bunch of blog entries onto the Internet to help spread the word" about Launchpad.

==== Kubuntu Maverick All Planned Out at UDS ====

Jonathan Riddell writes about Kubuntu Maverick and invites those who want to help out to take a look at the specs and the Todo list and see where you can help out.

Ubuntu Developer Summit is over, we emerged from the deepest darkest Belgian forest full of plans for the next six months of Kubuntu. The specs are written [1] and we have a lengthy Todo list [2]. If you've ever thought about helping out Kubuntu take a look at the Todo list and see if there's anything that inspires you.

If there's a theme to our plans for the next six months it's filling in the obvious holes we have in our offering. KPackageKit has plans for usability love, we found a way to have an "App Store" view in KPackageKit, new printer setup tools are in the works, samba file sharing might well get fixed. We'll also have Kolabsys keeping an eye on our KDE PIM packages. There's hopes for a "mobile" version of Kubuntu for weeny devices and the Netbook and Desktop CDs will probably merge into one. Oh and we plan to ship with Rekonq for a web browser, it's getting nicer every day. Agateau showed his plans for a global menu bar which is currently being discussed with the Plasma Netbook guys as a possible way to save screen space.

If it all works out it'll be a lovely release, do come and join us.

==== Daniel Holbach: Debian and Ubuntu ====

I was particularly happy that Stefano Zacchiroli, the Debian Project Leader, was at the last Ubuntu Developer Summit in Brussels. He’s a great guy. Also was I quite happy with the discussion at UDS and the notes we all took from it. Here’s Stefano’s report [1].

While having concrete actions to follow up on are great, we also need more people from both projects engaging with each other and sharing knowledge and their project’s culture so we form a mutual understanding of both.

http://daniel.holba.ch/blog/?p=682

==== Daniel Holbach: Archive / Permissions Reorg confusion ====

For a few development cycles we have been working on reorganising the Ubuntu archive and developer permissions. There were a lot of changes that were suggested and discussed and it proved to be quite a bit of work.
We completed a huge chunk of it and because there are many misconceptions about it, here’s a list of changes that are implemented today:

* Ubuntu developers can apply for upload rights for one or more specific packages. This is very interesting for upstream or Debian maintainers or simply people who are interested in just a very narrow selection of packages.
* We created a list of package sets. This concept works great for teams that are interested simply in a subset of packages, ie: kubuntu, ubuntu-server, ubuntu-desktop, etc. You can query them via theLaunchpad API. Also can you apply for upload rights for those.
* Because of these changes, we merged ubuntu-main-sponsors and ubuntu-universe-sponsors into ubuntu-sponsors. Here a view that explains who can upload which packages. (Process docs.)
* Also did we merge motu-sru into ubuntu-sru. (Process docs.)
* Also did we merge motu-release into ubuntu-release. (Process docs.)

These changes will give us much more flexibility in giving teams more liberties to maintain packages efficiently. Also do the changes above make it easier for contributors, because for things like sponsorship, SRU and release decisions they just get in touch with one team, no matter which package set the package maybe be in in the end.

==== Kenneth Wimer: Ubuntu Maverick UDS Group Photo made with the Hugin Panorama Creator ====

Ken Wimer, walks readers through how he created the UDS-M group photo using Hugin.  In the first paragraph of the post Ken gives the reason why he chose to stitch the photos, "Due to the weather and the layout of the hotel grounds at the Ubuntu Developer Summit for 10.10.10 (Maverick Meerkat) it was impossible to take the group photo outside and from above (which I prefer). The next best place was the auditorium in which the daily plenary's took place. Unfortunately the room is quite wide and my 24mm objective didn't fit the bill (it was quite dark as well)."

Ken walks readers of his blog through the steps he took to create the picture and even includes screen shots.  To see the group photo and to find out more about how it was created go to:

==== Clearing the air around Ubuntu and Chrome ====

Trevan Mc``Gee of Ubuntu User says reports that Ubuntu would ditch longtime default browser Firefox for Google's Chrome browser were put to rest with a resounding "sort of." A recent blog post by Ubuntu Community team member Jorge Castro explained that while Canonical has considered a Firefox alternative, it isn't Google Chrome, but rather Chromium, the open source version of the Chrome browser. Castro was also quick to dispel any rumors that the potential browser switch was for the desktop build of Ubuntu. If Chromium is chosen, it will only affect the netbook edition of Ubuntu 10.10. Again, this is all potential. The distribution models for Chromium and Ubuntu are largely dissimilar, so coordinating a chromium release so that it can be packaged in Ubuntu Netbook Edition is its own challenge. The Mozilla Foundation is also prepping a faster, sleeker version of Firefox for a fall release as well, so at this point its anyone's game.

==== Teo, the New Tough Linux Netbook From ZaReason ====

Linux``Planet's Carla Schroder tells us that the nice folks at Za``Reason, the independent Linux OEM computer vendor, sent her their Teo tough netbook to review. This turned into a family affair as Schroder's excellent significant other Terry was charmed by the little netbook, and had to try it out. The Teo feels sturdy. She's a beefy little girl, not as thin as other netbooks, but still very portable. The screen is beautiful; it is bright and sharp, and quite readable even for Schroder and Terry, with, as Schroder puts it, "Our don't-like-small-print eyes." Colors are excellent, with true bright whites, and good saturated reds, blues, and greens. The standard operating system is Ubuntu 10.04. Like all Za``Reason computers, it comes with an Ubuntu meta-key instead of a Windows key. Despite the Teo's modest specifications (by modern standards) neither of Schroder or her friend Terry experienced any performance annoyances. Web surfing, using Cheese, Open``Office and other applications were fine. A good part of the credit must go to Canonical, because 10.04 is a pretty nice release. Executive summary: thumbs up!

==== Is Arch Linux Really Faster Than Ubuntu? ====

Michael Larabel of Phoronix reflects that often when he is preparing for cross-distribution comparisons or benchmarks of different operating systems (like our recent Mac OS X 10.6 vs. Windows 7 vs. Ubuntu 10.04 benchmarks) he is asked to include Arch Linux in the mix. This is usually on the basis of including a rolling-release distribution to provide a performance look at a constantly evolving distribution with many of the most recent open-source packages rather than a traditional distribution with packages that may be months older. Larabel tells us, "The main reason we do not deliver many benchmarks of Arch, Gentoo, or other distributions that use a rolling release approach is that they are not very reproducible with their results since their packages are frequently changing and there are more end-user customizations going on compared to most other distributions." However, to test the performance claims of Arch versus others, Phoronix has compared the performance of the newest Arch 2010.05 media against Ubuntu Linux. While Larabel says he often hears "Arch is faster than Ubuntu" and similar statements in Phoronix's forums and via email comments, this really is not the case. At least when both Arch and Ubuntu are put in as much a stock configuration as possible to reflect the "out of the box" experience encountered by most users, the numbers shown on this Intel Core 2 Duo notebook show the performance to be about the same.

http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=ubuntu_arch_faster&num=6

==== Early Release Schedules For Ubuntu 11.04, 11.10, 12.04 LTS ====

Phoronix's Michael Larabel admits that while the release schedules for Ubuntu Linux aren't exactly a close secret -- new releases generally coming in April and October with the version scheme being YY.MM such as Ubuntu 11.04 for the April 2011 release -- Canonical's Robbie Williamson has laid out tentative release schedules for Ubuntu 11.04, Ubuntu 11.10, and even Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. These release schedules are coming after Robbie began tweaking the release schedule for Ubuntu 10.10 (codenamed the Maverick Meerkat) from the original Ubuntu 10.10 release schedule from its final release on the 28th of October. Mark Shuttleworth wants to release Ubuntu 10.10 on the 10th of October (10/10/10), and so that's when the Maverick Meerkat will be introduced to the world. While these future release schedules are still quite tentative, they are available from the Ubuntu Wiki Release Schedule. [1]

==== Ubuntu vs. Fedora: The Latest Versions Square Off ====

Bruce Byfield of Datamation states that Ubuntu regularly claims to be the most popular Linux distribution. But, if so, Fedora is a competitive second. Both have thriving communities and are a major source of free and open source software innovation. Regularly, you can read on mailing lists of users having grown discontented with one and deciding to migrate to the other. In many users' minds, each is an alternative to the other. But how do the distributions really compare? The most reliable answer is to examine the latest releases, Ubuntu 10.04 (Lucid Lynx) and Fedora 13 (Goddard) -- or, to be exact, Fedora 13's release candidate, since last minute concerns delayed the final release that was expected this week by another seven days. Basically, with its reputation for innovation and its determination to provide only free software, the latest Fedora ranks among the best of the traditional distributions, with a GNOME desktop only lightly customize and branded. By contrast, Ubuntu's latest version places a higher emphasis on usability and commercial competitiveness -- so much so that it is making many of its changes inside the distribution before they are accepted by the GNOME project itself. Yet despite these different outlooks and goals, the differences turn out to be small, especially from an end-user's perspective. To devoted fans, the differences in the distros may loom large, but I suspect that the rest of us are unlikely to agree. These days, a change of desktops within a distribution is probably going to seem a more disruptive change than switching from one GNOME-based distribution to another.

=== In The Blogosphere ===

==== Lubuntu Netbook Remix: A Look ====

Christopher Tozzi at WorksWithU takes a look at Lubuntu Netbook Remix. LNR is a remix of Lubuntu, the Ubuntu variant based on LXDE. Christopher has three notable reasons why LNR is worth looking at as an option for netbook use: 1) It doesn't require 3D video hardware; 2) It's very fast; and 3) It's a combination of the traditional Lubuntu desktop panel and a netbook interface. Christopher also includes some screenshots of the LNR interface. While he concludes that he probably won't use LNR regularly, he recognizes this is because his netbook is new enough and fast enough to not have problems with Gnome. He also says that if he were to ever move to Lubuntu, he'd probably choose LNR over the regular Lubuntu.

==== New Ubuntu Advert Needs Your Voice - Literally ====

Ever wanted to help promote Ubuntu? Well now’s your chance!

The Ubuntu Ads project are launching a new advert, one that requires your voice to be heard – literally!

Ddorda from the aforementioned Ads team contacted me to ask for OMG! readers with a video camera/webcam & mic to record the message below, save it and then wing it over to the provided e-mail.
The clips will then pass through an awesome-o-matic before being collated into one super awesome Ubuntu advert.

What you need to say

Clear your throat and make sure you’re visible in frame and then record yourself saying this sentence in your native tongue (be that English, Swedish, Fnark or whatever): -

"My name is [YOUR NAME] and I use Ubuntu!"

Once you’ve recorded that and are satisfied send it to Ubuntuadverts@gmail.com with your name and what language you spoke in the clip.

You can see current examples of Ubuntu Ad’s work @  http://www.youtube.com/UbuntuAds
