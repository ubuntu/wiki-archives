This is a proposal to enhance the usability of the Ubiquity partitioning page. 
  
=== Rationale ===

Partitioning usually involves two separate operations: freeing up space and selecting a target.

Merging the two operations into a single action is potentially unsafe and it might be confusing.

It would be more appropriate to limit the target selection only to safe partitions/disks. I.E. partition and/or disks that are already empty and are big enough to host a new Ubuntu installation. If more space is needed the user will have a clear option to either resize an existing partition or to delete an existing disk/partion. After freeing up the necessary space a new item will appear in the the Install-Into list.

In particular, with this approach, it is not possible to accidentally overwrite/delete any file unless the user explicitly selects "Delete an existing disk/partition" or (s)he uses the "Advanced Mode". 

=== Ubiquity Partitioning Page Mockup ===

All options are radio buttons, so only one of them can be selected

<pre>
Install into:
 [ ] Available free space in hard disk #1 (sda, 8GB) 
 [ ] Available free space in hard disk #2 (sdb, 6GB)
 [ ] Empty partition #2 of hard disk #1 (sda2, 26GB)
 [ ] Empty partition #5 of hard disk #1 (sda5, 12GB)
 [ ] Advanced Mode

Free up space for the new installation:
 [*] Resize an existing partition 
 [ ] Delete an existing disk/partition

[<< Previous ] [ Next >>]
</pre>

Alternative layout, using regular buttons for resize/delete operations

<pre>
Install into:
 [*] Available free space in hard disk #1 (sda, 8GB) 
 [ ] Available free space in hard disk #2 (sdb, 6GB)
 [ ] Empty partition #2 of hard disk #1 (sda2, 26GB)
 [ ] Empty partition #5 of hard disk #1 (sda5, 12GB)
 [ ] Advanced Mode

Free up space for the new installation:
 [Resize an existing partition] [Delete an existing disk/partition] 

[<< Previous ] [ Next >>]
</pre>

==== Page With No Available Free Space ====

If there is no available free space or empty partition the Install-into list will be empty and instead a message is displayed inviting the user to free up some space.

<pre>
No free space is available. 
You will need to free up some disk space first 
in order to continue the installation. 
A minimum of 4GB free is required.

 [*] Resize an existing partition 
 [ ] Delete an existing disk/partition

[<< Previous ] [ Next >>]
</pre>

Or

<pre>
No free space is available. 
You will need to free up some disk space first 
in order to continue the installation. 
A minimum of 4GB free is required.

 [Resize an existing partition] [Delete an existing disk/partition] 

[<< Previous ] [ Next >>]
</pre>

Alternatively, the resize/delete dialog could be shown directly.

==== Resize-Partition Dialog ====

<pre>
 Squeeze [partition #1] in [disk #1]
 to 5GB [ =====|========= ] and free up 10GB
 -----------------------------------------------------
 Partition Info: /dev/sda1
 Total size: 15GB
 In use: 4GB
 Label: mytarget
 Filesystem: NTFS
 Files: WINDOWS, temp, Program Files, RECYCLER
 -----------------------------------------------------
 [Resize Partition] [Cancel]
</pre>

==== Delete-Partition Dialog ====

It might be safer not to merge the resize/delete dialogs, so that a user does not accidentally wipe a partition that was supposed to be resized. 

<pre>
 Delete: [partition #1 | all partitions] in [disk #1]
 and free up 15GB
 -----------------------------------------------------
 Partition Info: /dev/sda1
 Total size: 15GB
 In use: 4GB
 Label: mytarget
 Filesystem: NTFS
 Files: WINDOWS, temp, Program Files, RECYCLER
 -----------------------------------------------------
 [Delete Partition] [Cancel]
</pre>

==== Advanced Mode ====

Same as ubiquity
* Overwrite an existing disk/partition #skip disk/partitions where wubi is installed
* Create multiple mountpoints
