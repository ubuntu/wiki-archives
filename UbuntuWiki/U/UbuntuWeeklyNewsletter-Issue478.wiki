==== Zygmunt Krynicki: Snap execution environment ====

Zygmunt Krynicki writes his fourth article about snappy interfaces, this time focusing on the execution environment. He covers in detail using the chroot environment, how process containment works and cases where a device control group is used.

http://www.zygoon.pl/2016/08/snap-execution-environment.html

==== Canonical Design Team: Web team hack day ====

Anthony Dillon of Ubuntu Design writes about the web team's hack day which was held in a hotel and started by brainstorming ideas, creating mini-teams and commencing the 'hack'. Projects were IRC bots, Asset manager search improvements, Git``Hub CMS, and commit linting. He says that the day went well with some projects 'landed and released'.

http://design.canonical.com/2016/08/web-team-hack-day/

==== Canonical Design Team: Competition winner – Timer App ====

Steph Wilson of Ubuntu Design reminds us of a competition to write an app that converges across devices using Adaptive``Page``Layout, which makes it easier to converge apps on many devices. She provides details of the winning app; a timer app, along with details of the 2nd through 5th place winners.

http://design.canonical.com/2016/08/competition-winner-timer-app/

==== Dustin Kirkland: Howdy, Windows! A Six-part Series about Ubuntu-on-Windows for Linux.com ====

==== Zygmunt Krynicki: Creating your first snappy interface ====

Zygmunt Krynicki continues his series about snappy with the fifth article, this time talking about creating snappy interfaces. He walks his readers through a sample “Hello” interface with the help of code snippits and screenshots. Zygmunt goes on to talk about granting permissions through interfaces and shares a more practical “reboot” interface.

==== Julian Andres Klode: Porting APT to CMake ====

Julian Andres Klode briefly tells us some history of APTs build system (autoconf & makefiles), and the decision to go with CMake in 2009. He says that this seemed to work until a few months ago; so after a busy weekend, CMake has been updated. Julian details the changes, advantages, the testing, and some issues saying that it still needs some work (eg. documentation), and asks from those that build on macOS or *BSD and have issues to report back.

==== Aaron Honeycutt: Plasma features – The endless search Pt.1 ====

Aaron Honeycutt writes about the 'Digital Clock' widget in KDE Plasma, and the features Aaron needed dealing with a global team. He explains how to add extra time-zones (with screen images) should you wish to use this feature, but it should be noted that the changes require Plasma 5.7.2.

==== Simon Quigley: A look at Lubuntu’s LXQt Transition ====

Simon Quigley, a member of the Lubuntu team, lists the applications that are candidates (he notes that these are not final) to be included in Lubuntu once it has been migrated to LXQt. He says that images will be added to the ISO QA Tracker when they become available and that specific test cases need to be created. Of the transition to LXQt, Simon says: "I'm really excited for this transition, and I hope you are too."

==== Windows 10 vs. Ubuntu + Linux 4.7 + Mesa 12.1 Intel OpenGL Tests ====

Michael Larabel of Phoronix compares and contrasts the performances of Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and the recent Windows 10 Anniversary release. He runs specific benchmark tests such as openArena and Ugine Heaven coupled with GPU tests and also with individual games such as Shadow of mordor, Tomb Raider etc in the brief comparison. Michael shows that the Windows 10 update outperforms most of the Linux systems but as of now the Linux systems show promise with better results than their previous counterparts.
