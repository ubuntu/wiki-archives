=== In the Press ===

==== Ubuntu Lunar Lobster could be the surprise hit of 2023 ====

Jack Wallen reminds us his last review of Ubuntu Desk top "declared it predictable" which "is a good thing", that Jack believes Ubuntu 23.04 will be again. We are told of the new installer (totally re-written but changes appear only cosmetic), plus GNOME 44.0’s promotion on the desk top. Using a number of screenshots, Jack walks us through what he sees using a daily image, and states "the Ubuntu development and design teams have proved to be masters of subtle and effective change".

https://www.zdnet.com/article/ubuntu-lunar-lobster-could-be-the-surprise-hit-of-2023/

==== Linux desktop leaders unite behind Flathub app store. Here's why ====

Steven Vaugan-Nichols reminds us that the GNOME Foundation and KDE Foundations are creating an appstore using Flatpak, giving us some of the benefits of appimage/flatpak & snap which containerize apps. We are then told why the chosen platform is Flatpak (instead of Snap), and given some stats on Flathub. Steven ends saying he hopes the store will succeed, as he expresses the view that this will help the Linux desktop.

https://www.zdnet.com/article/linux-desktop-leaders-unite-behind-flathub-app-store-heres-why/

==== After nearly two decades of waiting, GNOME 44 brings you... image thumbnails ====

Liam Proven writes that "GNOME 44 is reaching readiness", before moving to some of the technical changes that have occurred underneath what we use. Liam briefly touches on GTK3 to GTK4, Mutter advances, Wayland's fractional scaling, and more. We're told some features that disappeared in GNOME 43 (but were missed by users) have returned, with VPN support in settings; all of which should make this a welcome release.

https://www.theregister.com/2023/03/14/gnome_44_release_candidate/

=== In the Blogosphere ===

==== Ubuntu 23.04 Will Ship with Linux Kernel 6.2 ====

Joey Sneddon writes that Ubuntu 23.04 will use the Linux 6.2 kernel at release. With a brief discussion on the 6.1 kernel & kernel LTS support, we are told this is a big deal even if you're using Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, as that release will get the 23.04 kernel in due course too. Some links are provided for details, a quote from Dimitri John Ledkov reporting no further 6.1 builds will occur, and Joey reporting this is "exciting stuff".

==== Ubuntu 23.04 Default Wallpaper Revealed ====

Joey Sneddon writes it was "only natural that the designers of the official Ubuntu 23.04 background chose to lean lovingly into the ludicrous label with a lascivious zeal". Joey provides the image for us to look at, then discusses the image, telling us there is a colorized version & desaturated dull grayscale, with the release still scheduled for 20 April 2023.

==== 9 Ubuntu 23.04 (Lunar Lobster) Features We Spotted So Far ====

Ahnkus Das writes in this blog about nine features spotted thus far in Ubuntu 23.04 (Lunar Lobster). Ahnkus reminds us 23.04 is not a LTS release and is due out next month. Many screenshots are given with those nine features which includes the new installer, GNOME 44, mini ISO, app changes, Ubuntu Cinnamon as a flavor, the Linux 6.2 kernel, and more.
