==== Community Donations Report, Q2 2014 ====

Michael Hall informs us that whenever a user downloads Ubuntu from the website, they are asked if they would like to make a donation, and if so how they want their money used. He links to a report that breaks down the Community Donations for Q2 2014, adding that consistently less is spent each quarter than is received.

Inspired by a recent post about the awesome year that Ubuntu Italy had, Elizabeth K. Joseph recalls the events of last year for Ubuntu California. She writes about the Southern California Linux Expo, the release of Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, some local presentations, and some regular Ubuntu Hours that took place in San Francisco.

==== A year in the Cloud ====

Canonical writes "The new year is a perfect occasion to reflect on the road we just covered and how far we have come just in this past year." They briefly refer to the launch of Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS,  demonstrating container live migration at the Open``Stack summit in Paris, porting the Snappy technology from Ubuntu Phone to the cloud, and that Certified Public Cloud confirmed its position as the company’s fastest growing commercial program.

==== Stuart Langridge: Ubuntu phone screencasting, a minor tip ====

Stuart Langridge informs us that an Ubuntu phone has a command-line utility called "mirscreencast" which means in theory it's possible to record a video of your phone's screen. He says that in practice it doesn't work for video as the result is too jerky but that he has come up with a way to make it work better by sending the video over a network rather than save it to phone storage.
