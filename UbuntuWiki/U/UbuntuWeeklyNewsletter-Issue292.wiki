http://blog.canonical.com/2012/11/14/cloud-model-checklist/

=== In The Press ===

==== Devs port Ubuntu to Rockchip (RK3066) devices ====
Trent Nouveau for TG Daily reports on the progress being made by developers, especially AndrewDB, to port Ubuntu to run on the UG802 and other devices ported by Rockport's RK3066 chip. Most of these devices ship with Google Android due to limited access to the source code. While Ubuntu 12.10 on the UG802 is still a work in progress, it does already support 1080p monitors using the integrated HDMI port.

http://www.tgdaily.com/software-features/67476-devs-port-ubuntu-to-rockchip-rk3066-devices 

==== Ubuntu gaining ground in website deployments ====

Neil Mc``Allister of the Register reports on statistics from W3``Techs that states that 7% of the world's web servers are now using Ubuntu. This is an increase from 5.5% in the previous year. When adjusted to only include servers known to be using some version of Linux, this means Ubuntu is now used for 21.4% of Linux servers. Mc``Allister does also mention that W3``Tech was unable to identify which OS were used for many websites so these numbers are not perfect.

http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/11/16/ubuntu_gaining_ground_in_web_servers/

==== Ubuntu 12.10 review ====

Darien Graham-Smith reviews Ubuntu 12.10 for PC Pro. He points out new features such as the option on a clean install to encrypt the entire installation disk using a passphrase, and support for LVM volumes. He also comments on the increased integration of Web applications to the Dash and the expansion of Ubuntu One for cloud syncing and storage (and the beta for the native OS X Ubuntu One client). He discusses the change to rendering desktop graphic effects on the CPU when there is no compatible GPU driver. He does comment that on low-power machines, this can slow performance. Ultimately, he concludes that unless you're using an older or low-powered machine, Ubuntu 12.10 is a worthwhile place to start for a new user, but may not have enough new features to be worth the upgrade from 12.04 for an existing user.

=== In The Blogosphere ===

==== Will 2013 Be the Year of the Ubuntu Desktop? ====

In an article title that he admits many readers will “likely groan at”, Matt Hartley of Datamation speculates why he believes 2013 could be a “huge year for Linux on the desktop.” Points include: many successes in 2012, improvements to Ubuntu which include interest from gaming developers such as Valve, and the role that money plays. Hartley concludes by answering his question and saying “I, with countless others, have made it a personal mission to make every year an Ubuntu celebration instead.”

http://www.datamation.com/open-source/will-2013-be-the-year-of-the-ubuntu-desktop-1.html 

==== New Animated 'Ubuntu For Android' Ad Hits the Web ====

Joey-Elijah Sneddon of OMG! Ubuntu! reports on a new Ubuntu for Android advertisement that was released this week, but that the code for it is still not available to contributors. Sneddon speculates “Is its appearance a subtle prelude to a formal announcement? Is an Ubuphone finally in the offing? Logical Joey says ‘probably not’. It’s more likely that the ad was released to sustain and build on the awareness already generated for the technology. This pent-up demand could then be used by Canonical in negotiations with vendors interesting in rolling with it.”

=== In Other News ===

==== ZaReason’s Ubuntu All-in-One PC Might Look A Little Familiar… ====

Joey-Elijah Sneddon of OMG! Ubuntu! reviews Za``Reason’s new Zimo 930, an all-in-one PC that uses the same physical shell as the System76 Sable released earlier this year. Sneddon writes, that both “have 21.5″ screens, Intel Graphics, 4GB of RAM, and an Intel i5 CPU. To stand out a little the Zimo has a marginally more powerful processor (a quad-core3.1Ghz i5 to the Sable’s quad-core 2.9Ghz i5); a 64GB SSD in place of a mechanical hard-drive; and a few extra ports.” Prices for the systems similarly speced out are equivalent.

Stephen Michael Kellat from the Ohio Local Community Team is back and talks this week about the geographical challenges facing the Ohio team in terms of coming together.
