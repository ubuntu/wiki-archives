== Snappy Ubuntu Core - alpha-02 ==

Hello Snappy Lovers,

ss you might have already spotted in the news, this time we bring you the snappiness of Ubuntu Core right to the Thing next to you :).

Release highlights that got packed up in this snappy Ubuntu Core alpha release with focus on the Things world include:

1. a new port of ubuntu-core system image to armhf architecture
2. support for u-boot for our transaction system image update
3. an early drop of our new  "Web Device Manager" (webdm) framework that enables humans to manage snappy systems through their browser
4. a prebuilt beaglebone image that comes with webdm preinstalled
5. ubuntu-device-flash as tool to produce snappy images for local hacking on enablement and to assemble your custom appliance
6. a porting guide to explain to the world of board manufacturers what they need to do to get their board ready for development of snappy appliances

Also you might be pleased to see that we have started consolidating our tutorials, walkthroughs. docs, specs and examples into a single place on developer.ubuntu.com [2] that is eaasy to remember and easy to find.

Of course, this release also brings a refresh of our already availble snappy ubuntu-core offerig for the cloud. Install instructions on how to get the latest on KVM and your favourite public cloud can still be found on our snappy cloud landing page [3]

For that that want to know more details, check out our release wiki page that we created for this release [4].

Thanks and see you soon snapping yet another thing :).

Cheers,

 - Alexander
