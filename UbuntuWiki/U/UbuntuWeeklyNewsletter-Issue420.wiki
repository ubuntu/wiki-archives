==== BQ launches the new Aquaris E5 HD Ubuntu Edition ====

Canonical, in conjunction with BQ, announces the launch of the Aquaris E5 HD Ubuntu Edition phone which follows on from the Aquaris E4.5 Ubuntu Edition, and which will come with impressive new features such as a 5 inch HD display and 16GB of internal memory. Cristian Parrino of Canonical says: "BQ is a fearless innovator whose risk with Ubuntu has already paid off  - the launch of this second device in Europe marks an amazing milestone for both companies."  While Alberto Méndez of BQ says of Canonical: "Working with Canonical on bringing the Aquaris E5 Ubuntu Edition has been very satisfying. We share the same philosophy as them along with the same commitment to the Open Source Initiative."

==== Costales: "Ubuntu reduces PC troubleshooting in a school", by Open Source Observatory (European Commission) ====

Costales announces that following an interview last year, a project to convert schools from Windows to Ubuntu was successful, and that the European Commission is now using it as an example.

http://thinkonbytes.blogspot.com/2015/06/ubuntu-reduces-pc-troubleshooting-in.html

==== Xubuntu: Xubuntu at Computer Reach ====

The Xubuntu team interviews Kevin Driscoll, PC/Linux Technical Consultant at Computer Reach about their use of Xubuntu in their organization, why they chose to deploy open source software and some of the details about how they go about deploying Xubuntu. Kevin concludes: “If you think about the tremendous variety of brands and models of computers made in that time frame, it is astounding how many combinations of equipment our (often non-technical) volunteers run into. Yet after a quick PXE-boot, Clonezilla automated script runs on those computers, it will reboot into a completely operational Linux environment is amazing! Xubuntu is so resilient to be able to run, without prompt for drivers, on so many different kinds of PC’s!”
