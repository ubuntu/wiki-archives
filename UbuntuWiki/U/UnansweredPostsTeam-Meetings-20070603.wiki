Jun 02 20:06:11 <Jacob> woah... its 8
Jun 02 20:06:16 <Jacob> err.. 0 utc
Jun 02 20:06:46 <Jacob> looks like i'm late for a meeting i scheduled... ha
Jun 02 20:07:03 <kidders> tut tut...
Jun 02 20:07:07 <kidders> go stand in the corner
Jun 02 20:07:12 <kidders> :P
Jun 02 20:07:21 <Jacob> already am ;)
Jun 02 20:07:37 <kidders> hehe
Jun 02 20:07:41 <Jacob> anywho, no "big" topics to discuss tonight
Jun 02 20:08:07 <Jacob> but it's been a month + 1 week since the last meeting.. so we'll check up on whats going on.
Jun 02 20:08:25 <ajmorris_> ah
Jun 02 20:08:28 <ajmorris_> sorry i'm late
Jun 02 20:08:43 <Jacob> no problem ajmorris_, i just got to my laptop a minute ago :-D
Jun 02 20:09:00 <ajmorris_> kk
Jun 02 20:09:01 <Jacob> to start, i'm shutting off beryl because this is the 5th time it has crashed today
Jun 02 20:09:35 <Jacob> AGH! now firefox crashes
Jun 02 20:10:19 <ajmorris_> u using gutys dude?
Jun 02 20:10:24 <ajmorris_> *gutsy
Jun 02 20:10:50 <Jacob> ajmorris_: feisty, and it has only been unstable today.. i did mess with my X configuration however, i might reboot later
Jun 02 20:11:01 <ajmorris_> kk
Jun 02 20:11:07 <Jacob> next off: these UAresolved tags seem to be doing somewhat well
Jun 02 20:11:18 <Jacob> 80 topics tagged with them
Jun 02 20:11:44 <Jacob> however, i'm wondering if we should keep them
Jun 02 20:12:23 <Jacob> they are keeping "fixed" topics out of the bumped posts filter, but it still seems like a bit of a hassle at times.
Jun 02 20:12:33 <Jacob> I even forget to put them on posts.
Jun 02 20:13:03 <ajmorris_> i forgot we had them
Jun 02 20:13:04 <ajmorris_> lol
Jun 02 20:13:09 <Jacob> (so did I)
Jun 02 20:13:23 * inkogneato has quit ("Into the great wide open...")
Jun 02 20:13:23 <kidders> I've been lazy about it too :(
Jun 02 20:13:36 <Jacob> I think this is something that can be polled on the forums later; on whether we shall keep them
Jun 02 20:14:39 <Jacob> madmetal/spyros has been doing a good job of remembering it looks like, since 80% of all topics in this search were last posted by him
Jun 02 20:16:01 * Jacob is looking thru the last meeting log to find out what was said
Jun 02 20:16:27 <spd106> To be honest I don't like the word resolved being in there, kinda gives the wrong impression
Jun 02 20:16:44 <Jacob> spd106: my thoughts exactly
Jun 02 20:17:05 <spd106> UATeam would achieve the same results
Jun 02 20:17:14 <Jacob> yeah
Jun 02 20:17:26 <spd106> Without sounding like we had solved the problem
Jun 02 20:17:35 <kidders> :)
Jun 02 20:17:37 <Jacob> i actually was asked about that once
Jun 02 20:17:56 <Jacob> (but then they saw my signature and read the answer)
Jun 02 20:18:52 <Jacob> so our choices are: 1) keep it, 2) change it to UATeam (or similar), 3) scrap the idea
Jun 02 20:19:24 <spd106> I like the idea of promoting our presence
Jun 02 20:19:57 <kidders> me too. i suggest switching to "UATeam" and ...
Jun 02 20:20:11 <kidders> ... scrapping the idea, only if it turns out not to be useful
Jun 02 20:20:17 <ajmorris_> where is the uaresolved thing?
Jun 02 20:20:24 <ajmorris_> i just answered a post and cant find it
Jun 02 20:20:43 <Jacob> ajmorris_: http://ubuntuforums.org/search.php?d...ery=UAResolved
Jun 02 20:21:07 <Jacob> although it might be a few moments until the search index is updated
Jun 02 20:21:10 <ajmorris_> Jacob, "Sorry - no matches. Please try some different terms."
Jun 02 20:21:24 <Jacob> strange... it seems to work here
Jun 02 20:21:28 <Jacob> try http://ubuntuforums.org/search.php?searchid=21365822
Jun 02 20:21:39 <Jacob> ack - never mind
Jun 02 20:21:56 <Jacob> try clicking on the last link on http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=390283
Jun 02 20:21:58 <ajmorris_> no, but do we click a UAresolved button when resolving a post?
Jun 02 20:22:03 <Jacob> nope
Jun 02 20:22:15 <Jacob> you just add the text at the end
Jun 02 20:22:25 <ajmorris_> oh, my bad
Jun 02 20:22:26 <ajmorris_> lol
Jun 02 20:22:29 <Jacob> :-D
Jun 02 20:23:47 <Jacob> anyway, we'll poll this on the forums
Jun 02 20:24:46 <Jacob> as for the suggested forum changes from last time, i can't see them happening soon
Jun 02 20:25:02 <Jacob> (as in moving the subscribed thread box and search options)
Jun 02 20:25:28 <Jacob> asked about the subscribed thread box, never got a response
Jun 02 20:26:06 <Jacob> although there have been times when things have been scheduled for the next forum update and just haven't been published yet
Jun 02 20:28:29 <spd106> I like the new "check if already posted" button, though I don't know how much it's being used
Jun 02 20:28:48 <Jacob> i agree
Jun 02 20:29:45 <Jacob> i think that should be a required option, especially in ABT. once they click submit, it should do a search, and ask the user if they still want to continue
Jun 02 20:30:11 <ajmorris_> like when posting a bug in launchpad :)
Jun 02 20:30:26 <kidders> I think so too, Jacob
Jun 02 20:30:37 <Jacob> ajmorris_: right
Jun 02 20:31:29 <Jacob> are all of you using firefox as your web browser?
Jun 02 20:31:36 <Jacob> or Epiphany?
Jun 02 20:31:54 <ajmorris_> when i don't have to use an i.e. only page, i use firefox
Jun 02 20:32:29 * spd106 uses Firefox
Jun 02 20:32:30 <kidders> i don't have any particular habit
Jun 02 20:33:43 <Jacob> ack, never mind, i was thinking of something to track posts but then realized it wouldn't work out so well :-P
Jun 02 20:34:27 <kidders> you're not going to tell us about it?
Jun 02 20:35:27 <Jacob> well, it would have been something to the effect of a greasemonkey extension that would automatically send topics to a tracker when you reply
Jun 02 20:35:52 <Jacob> but then i'm starting to think of privacy implications of it sending every topic link to it
Jun 02 20:36:21 <Jacob> maybe a confirmation dialog or checkbox near the submit button
Jun 02 20:36:35 <Jacob> let me rephrase this then, it could actually work
Jun 02 20:37:03 <Jacob> 1) You find a thread that needs answering, while already having this "extension" installed.
Jun 02 20:37:16 <Jacob> 2) You hit Reply and start writing an answer.
Jun 02 20:38:06 <Jacob> 3) The extension will add a checkbox above the Submit button to send the topic to a central location, accessible only to UA team members, where it could be tracked
Jun 02 20:38:53 <Jacob> benefits of tracking would be the ability to ask questions between the team on a topic, and mark them as resolved/unresolved and such
Jun 02 20:39:15 <Jacob> However this is just an idea floating around in my head
Jun 02 20:39:23 <spd106> How about an irc bot for forum posts, like ubotu does for bug reports?
Jun 02 20:39:37 <Jacob> spd106: yeah, and i was actually about to type that
Jun 02 20:39:48 <kidders> Most browsers have some sort of built-in search capability that we could hijack, either.
Jun 02 20:40:05 <Jacob> although... we need a server for an IRC bot, and my host strictly prohibits them
Jun 02 20:40:17 <Jacob> kidders: i see what you mean, like the firefox search bar
Jun 02 20:40:32 <kidders> Yeah... Firefox users could just drag a tab onto the search bar
Jun 02 20:40:48 <kidders> ... Opera users could just put a "U" or something before the URL and reload it
Jun 02 20:40:55 <Jacob> ooh, i like that idea
Jun 02 20:41:22 <Jacob> and it seems to work when i drag a tab into the search bar (although google returns no results)
Jun 02 20:41:32 <kidders> Yep
Jun 02 20:41:51 <kidders> ... adding an extra "search" would be trivial for most users
Jun 02 20:42:00 <Jacob> another option for that would be a bookmarklet, that when you click it, it takes you to a tracker
Jun 02 20:43:16 <Jacob> kind of like the TinyURL! and reddit this buttons for toolbars
Jun 02 20:44:10 <kidders> hmmm...
Jun 02 20:44:12 <Jacob> i'll probably end up scripting some massive database system for this.. I script PHP when i'm bored.
Jun 02 20:44:16 <Jacob> lol
Jun 02 20:44:30 <kidders> The way I see it, if someone felt kind enough to create/host something that could read post IDs off URL querystrings...
Jun 02 20:44:43 <kidders> ... there would be any number of ways it could be plugged into browsers
Jun 02 20:45:02 <kidders> ... people could use whatever idea they thought was smartest
Jun 02 20:45:05 <Jacob> we can give the option I suppose
Jun 02 20:45:06 <Jacob> yeah
Jun 02 20:45:21 <kidders> yeah
Jun 02 20:45:22 <kidders> ...
Jun 02 20:45:29 <kidders> from an implementation perspective...
Jun 02 20:45:45 <kidders> the only thing that would be important would ...
Jun 02 20:46:11 <kidders> ... be what the script liked people to send it
Jun 02 20:46:26 <kidders> (in terms of a querystring, for instance)
Jun 02 20:47:07 <Jacob> well.. it could either take a whole url or topic id as I'm seeing it
Jun 02 20:47:18 <kidders> yip
Jun 02 20:47:21 <Jacob> (thank god for regular expressions in that case)
Jun 02 20:47:24 <kidders> lol
Jun 02 20:48:04 <Jacob> well i'll probably make a subdomain for it tonight/tomorrow and write some sort of tracking system
Jun 02 20:49:06 <Jacob> this is something easy enough to implement and it also takes the load off of the forum servers ;)
Jun 02 20:49:29 <kidders> I'd be happy to help ... but I doubt you'd need it!
Jun 02 20:49:45 <Jacob> hehe
Jun 02 20:50:27 <Jacob> you can help draft ideas / test / code (SQL + JavaScrpt + PHP) if you want
Jun 02 20:50:34 <kidders> sure
Jun 02 20:50:40 <Jacob> although be warned: i don't use revision systems O.o
Jun 02 20:51:01 <kidders> you're like me then? hehe
Jun 02 20:51:06 <Jacob> ;)
Jun 02 20:51:34 <Jacob> countless times have i lost many lines of code because of random server occurences
Jun 02 20:51:57 <Jacob> forgetting to save in vim, connection drops, overwriting the wrong file...
Jun 02 20:52:01 <kidders> nasty
Jun 02 20:52:08 <Jacob> but i have survived still....
Jun 02 20:52:23 <Jacob> maybe i'll use Baazar on it soon
Jun 02 20:52:32 <Jacob> but not yet ;)
Jun 02 20:54:24 <Jacob> I have nothing else to say for this meeting, anybody have anything?
Jun 02 20:54:55 <ajmorris_> none here
Jun 02 20:54:58 <spd106> nope
Jun 02 20:55:10 * kidders has quit (Read error: 113 (No route to host))
Jun 02 20:55:19 <Jacob> i'd take that as a no :-P
Jun 02 20:55:23 <ajmorris_> lol
