==== Karmic Koala Alpha 5 released ====

Welcome to Karmic Koala Alpha 5, which will in time become Ubuntu 9.10.

Pre-releases of Karmic are *not* encouraged for anyone needing a stable system or anyone who is not comfortable running into occasional, even frequent breakage. They are, however, recommended for Ubuntu developers and those who want to help in testing, reporting, and fixing bugs.

Alpha 5 is the fifth in a series of milestone CD images that will be released throughout the Karmic development cycle. The Alpha images are known to be reasonably free of showstopper CD build or installer bugs, while representing a very recent snapshot of Karmic. You can download it here:

* Ubuntu http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/karmic/alpha-5/
* Ubuntu Server UEC & EC2 http://uec-images.ubuntu.com/releases/karmic/alpha-5/
* Ubuntu ARM http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ports/releases/karmic/alpha-5/
* Kubuntu http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/releases/karmic/alpha-5/
* Xubuntu http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/xubuntu/releases/karmic/alpha-5/
* Mythbuntu http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/mythbuntu/releases/karmic/alpha-5/

See http://wiki.ubuntu.com/Mirrors for a list of mirrors.

Alpha 5 includes a number of software updates that are ready for large-scale testing. This is quite an early set of images, so you should expect some bugs. For a list of known bugs (that you don't need to report if you encounter), please see: http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/karmic/alpha5

==== Jono Bacon: Three Years At Canonical ====

Three years ago today Jono joined Canonical as the Ubuntu Community Manager.

Throughout this time there have been many adventures and many stories. Jono has had the good fortune to not just work with good people, but great people. The Ubuntu family is a welcoming, inspiring and productive one, and he feels a very personal connection to the ethos and opportunity of Ubuntu, and the incredible people who turn that ethos from theory into something we can all see and touch.

Jono wants to thank the inspiring Ubuntu community for making this role such a pleasure to wake up to every day, and thanks also to his awesome team and his peers. Here’s to another three years!

You can read the entire article at the link below.

==== Canonical adds Advanced Ubuntu Service and Support ====

Premium Service Engineer (PSE), a new level of support for large enterprises, offers a single point of contact for Canonical’s large customers – enabling a faster response time and faster issue resolution. PSEs have access to all levels of support, including Canonical’s platform engineers.

“Having a Premium Service Engineer has been vital to getting the level of support we require to improve our operational infrastructure.” said Chief Technology Officer Antonio José Sáenz from Isotrol, a pioneering customer of the PSE service. “As we are involved in the delivery of many open-source projects and ourselves operate a large Ubuntu and Debian server and desktop environment, being able to rely on a dedicated Ubuntu expert from Canonical reduces the pressure of supporting high-profile open-source projects externally and internally.”

PSEs work pro-actively to support Canonical’s enterprise customers – becoming virtual team members who collaborate with IT/IS staff. They conduct regular technical and service reviews, transferring best-practice knowledge, and helping enterprises optimize their Ubuntu environments.

“One of the reasons we decided to engage a Premium Service Engineer from Canonical was to have an open-source Ubuntu expert on-hand on a continuous basis to help and ensure all our business units equally benefited from operational best practices,” said Saenz from Isotrol.

Information and pricing for the PSE service is available at http://www.ubuntu.com/support/services/pse

==== Ubuntu NC LoCo Team Meet-n-Greet ====

September 5th was the Ubuntu NC Lo``Co team meet-n-greet in Asheville, NC at the Fire``Storm Cafe and Books. What an AWESOME turnout! Once there, all the people stayed until 2pm the scheduled time for the meeting to end. Folks started filtering in in ones and twos, and before they knew it the whole coffee shop was full of Ubuntu and Open Source devotees. There was also a great Ubuntu success story in the making there. The Coffee shop's computers for public use all run Ubuntu and the Point of Sale system is Ubuntu as well. The Coffee shop is worker owned, and it's just a really cool place, with really nice people. They are Ubuntu enthusiasts helping spread the Ubuntu Spirit one cup of coffee at a time.

==== Swedish Ubuntu Team News ====

Andreas Olssonis the newly elected Team Contact for the Swedish Lo``Co team. He's been a part of the Swedish Lo``Co since January 2008. Besides helping out with support, and a short tour as a forum moderator, his primary Lo``Co work has been done in the role as one of the server administrators. Now he's looking forward to a whole lot of new challenges in the role as Team Contact. Outside the Lo``Co Andreas is part of Ubuntu Bug Control, primarily doing triage on bugs related to the server team. One of his current goals is to get the Swedish Lo``Co more involved in the triage process.

The team also has a new team leader, Mathias Friman. Mathias takes over for former team leaders Urban and Vulfgar who did a great job. While Andreas deals with external communications, Mathias will be responsible for the Lo``Co's internal organization.

==== Ubuntu Massachusetts LoCo adds new look to network installs ====

The Ubuntu Massachusetts Lo``Co team has configured a lovely tftp/pxe boot installer system that allows refurbished computers to be installed ridiculously easily via PXE booting. There are still quirks and such, they can’t yet get it to install ubuntu restricted extras by default, although they have gotten skype, libdvdcss2 and java to install by default, but once sorted out these OEM machine installs will have all the updates, all the common desktop packages, anything extra they want to add including replacement gdm theme or extra docs / manuals and it’s must less hassle than a CD or USB boot media. Settings are delivered by kickstart scripts and they have a local mirror supplying all the packages, so installs can be quite quick even with all the updates.

=== New in Karmic Koala ===

==== Karmic gets another cloud tool: Tahoe-LAFS ====

The Tahoe Lightweight Authorization File System, or Tahoe-LAFS for short, is a cloud storage tool with "provider-independent security" -- your file can't be read or modified even by the cloud storage provider who owns and operates the servers. The Tahoe-LAFS storage tool was accepted for Karmic slightly after Feature Freeze according to the  Feature exception. To find out more about Tahoe-LAFS, visit: http://allmydata.org

=== Ubuntu Forums News ===

==== Tutorial of the Week ====

Many times, users having computers not connected to the internet or on very slow connections come to the forums and ask how they can update/upgrade their setup. Bob``Songs (http://ubuntuforums.org/member.php?u=53299) has written a very useful and well written and supported thread, where other users also came to give input and improve the tutorial. The thread has been live for 2 1/2 years and covers all supported ubuntu releases and major environments (ubuntu, kubuntu and xubuntu). Thank you Bob``Songs!

==== Pasi Lallinaho: Help Fill in the Ubuntu IRC channels ====

We want you, the Xubuntu user and/or fan, to join the channel #xubuntu on the freenode IRC network. While our average user count was 90 a few months ago, it’s now about 60. We want more people! As the Karmic release comes closer, we start to prepare for the next big wave of questions – you can be part of the helping team as well. However please do remember that #xubuntu is for support, and if you want to chat about just about everything, you should join #xubuntu-offtopic.

==== Ubuntu Karmic's Installer Slideshow ====

Michael Larabel of Phoronix tells us that on September 3rd Ubuntu 9.10 Alpha 5 was released and besides shipping with a number of updated packages and the Ubuntu One client along with Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud images, the Ubiquity installer shipped with its new slide-show feature enabled. Now during the Ubuntu installation process from the desktop Live``CD, rather than just showing a status bar it also advertises various features of this Linux operating system. For those that have not yet tried Ubuntu 9.10 Alpha 5, this is something new in the Ubuntu land. The final release of Ubuntu 9.10 is due out in late October. http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=NzUwOQ

==== A Tour of the Ubuntu Software Store ====

The Linux Loops tells us that about a month ago, Canonical announced plans for an Ubuntu app store, codenamed App``Center. As expected, the first version has shown up in the Karmic Koala daily builds, now under the name Ubuntu Software Store. If you’re not impressed with the Ubuntu Software Store, the Linux Loop says they don’t blame you. It’s really not much more than a new interface that does the same thing Add/Remove does. The exciting parts of the Software Store don’t really come until Ubuntu 10.04, when it will replace Add/Remove, Synaptic, Software Sources, and, possibly, Update Manager. Over the next several releases, the Ubuntu Software Store could provide one of the first realistic ways for shareware developers to sell software for Linux and, at the same time, make it much easier for new users to understand the software installation process. For now, though, we’ll just have to wait and see. http://www.linuxloop.com/2009/08/30/a-tour-of-the-ubuntu-software-store/

==== ZaReason's New Linux Netbook, How to Thrive in a Tough Market ====

Carla Schroder of Linux Planet has a Q & A with Cathy and Earl Malmrose who founded Za``Reason several years ago. Schroder says that Za``Reason is a Linux OEM that has long intrigued her for a number of reasons: they encourage customers to open their boxes and tinker, they specialize in OEM Linux boxes, and they demonstrate that there is still room for independent shops in the rough-and-tumble world of computer retailing. In many ways the independents out-perform the big businesses as they understand Linux and Linux users, and a Linux-only shop doesn't have to contend with the pressures and restrictions that Microsoft puts on its partners. http://www.linuxplanet.com/linuxplanet/reports/6839/1/

==== Dell conquers Europe with its Ubuntu netbooks, enters the Netherlands ====

Newsvine's Vinnl states that with their new Latitude 2100 laptops, Dell is finally allowing Dutch consumers to pick Ubuntu as pre-installed operating system for their netbooks. The Latitude 2100 is targeted at small and medium businesses and costs €299, compared to €366 for its Windows counterpart. The version of the installed Ubuntu system is 8.10, a.k.a. Intrepid Ibex. Unfortunately, the Netherlands is not known for its large share of users of open source software (even though there's a very large number of contributors). That Dell still dares to enter this market with its Ubuntu offering shows, once again, that its current offering in other countries is a success - so much, that it dares to compete with established Dutch companies with an Ubuntu tradition. http://vinnl.newsvine.com/_news/2009/08/21/3177292-dell-conquers-europe-with-its-ubuntu-netbooks-enters-the-netherlands

==== Can Ubuntu 9.10 Outperform Mac OS X 10.6? ====

Michael Larabel of Phoronix says that now that he has tested Mac OS X 10.6, he is seeing how its performance compares to that of Ubuntu Linux. Ubuntu 9.10 "Karmic Koala" will be out in October and does have some performance improvements as Larabel's earlier tests have shown, but Canonical engineers have not been exclusively focusing on performance optimizations with this release. Can the Karmic Koala outperform Snow Leopard? Yes and no. Of the 26 tests shown in this article, Ubuntu 9.10 "Karmic Koala" was the clear winner in 12 of the 26 tests while Snow Leopard had won a handful and the rest of the tests had results that were too close to call or unchanged between the Apple and Canonical operating systems. Ubuntu 9.10 can certainly compete with Mac OS X 10.6 when it comes to the performance, but of course a few of these tests do show performance regressions compared to the earlier Ubuntu 9.04 release, an area where Ubuntu developers could improve. http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=ubuntu_karmic_leopard&num=1

==== Ubuntu 9.10 "Karmic Koala" Alpha 5 Released ====

Phoronix's Michael Larabel tells us that in just under two months Canonical will release Ubuntu 9.10 "Karmic Koala", but until then, there is the continual stream of new test releases. The latest test release to emerge from the Canonical camp is Ubuntu 9.10 Alpha 5. This fifth testing release of Mark Shuttleworth's operating system brings the Linux 2.6.31-rc8 kernel, the latest KDE/GNOME packages, a few updated X.Org bits, and many other package updates, although the Karmic Koala is now under a feature freeze. Also included in Ubuntu 9.10 Alpha 5 is the Ubuntu One file-sharing client and Ubuntu UEC (Enterprise Cloud) images with support for the Amazon EC2 cloud computing service. Besides that, there are the usual spins of Kubuntu, Xubuntu, Ubuntu Server, Ubuntu Netbook Remix, Ubuntu for ARM, and Mythbuntu. The testing page for Ubuntu 9.10 Alpha 5 can be found at Ubuntu.com. http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=NzUwNg

==== Ubuntu 9.10's New X Based Boot Splash ====

Softpedia's Marius Nestor says that he is are proud to announce that, as of this morning, Canonical added a brand-new X-based boot splash, which will be present in the upcoming Ubuntu 9.10 (Karmic Koala) operating system, due for release on October 29th. xplash is the package in charge of the new boot splash and it is a user-space software that uses the X interface to draw a splash screen at boot before the desktop loads. Nestor says that he has tested it on two 19" Samsung LCDs and a 19" DELL one, and it looks and acts pretty good, without flickering. The idea is to completely replace the existing boot method with a flicker-free one. The graphical boot splash is designed to run on top of the X.Org Server and not Usplash! A graphical operating system switcher will also be present during the boot sequence, accessible by pressing the ESC key. http://news.softpedia.com/news/Ubuntu-9-10-039-s-New-Boot-Splash-120193.shtml

=== In The Blogosphere ===

==== Dell Prepares Ubuntu Encore ====

The VAR Guy, writing in Works With U, notes that Dell has had some problems recently with their image regarding their Linux offerings.  However, he also notes that a source close to the Dell-Ubuntu efforts states the following:

    “There will be more [Dell Ubuntu] desktop  and notebook SKUs and the relationship will be more global then ever next year… there will be plenty of Ubuntu/Canonical and Dell good news stories in the near future.”

So things appear to be looking up.  See his article at:  http://www.workswithu.com/2009/08/28/dell-prepares-ubuntu-encore/

==== Openbravo on Ubuntu Server Edition: ERP Sales Will Take Time ====

Joe Panettieri, of Works With U, indicates that there is a lag-time between offering an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) and its actual acceptance by businesses.  Openbravo COO Josep Mitja indicated that Openbravo’s core products (enterprise resource planning and point-of-sale software) typically have long sales cycles.  However, Openbravo Quickstart, a custom configured offering is set to launch September 1, and Ubuntu Server Edition 9.10 – set to debut in October — includes several cloud enhancements that could further improve Ubuntu’s appeal beyond the desktop.

==== Sharp Launches Ubuntu Mobile Internet Tool ====

Joe Panettieri, writing for Works With U, has an article on the new Sharp PC-Z1.  This device, set to launch September 25 in Japan, is a new entry in the world of Mobile Internet Devices.  "It features a 5-inch TFT LCD touch-screen, runs Ubuntu 9.04 and launches in as little as 3 seconds."  Paul Miller of Engadget says that it's running a full Ubuntu install at a relatively high resolution and a rather snappy pace. More details at the link below.

* You can see an Engadget video of the new device here:  http://www.engadget.com/2009/09/03/sharp-pc-z1-netwalker-hands-on-ubuntu-like-youve-never-seen-it/

==== The easiest operating system to update is... ====

Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols, the Cyber Cyinc writing on the Computer``World blog site, tried upgrading several operating systems with an eye to ease and speed.  Among those that he tried were Microsoft Windows 7, Mac Snow Leopard and Ubuntu 9.04.  Of the three, he felt that the Ubuntu 9.04 upgrade was the easiest.  Read his explanation at:  http://blogs.computerworld.com/14629/the_easiest_operating_system_to_update_is

==== Ubuntu Software Store: Will Your Kids Try It? ====

Joe Panettieri, writing for Works With U, looks at the Ubuntu Software store through the eyes of the end user - his 10 year old son.  Considering that he is greatly taken with the Apple App Store, he feels that he would be just as happy with the Ubuntu Software Store.  He also feels that adults will flock to it for business and productivity applications.  See what he has to say at:  http://www.workswithu.com/2009/08/31/ubuntu-software-store-right-place-right-time/
