Aaron Prisk tells us Ubuntu and flavors are having another Ubuntu Testing Week from 2 March until 9 March 2023, this time testing Ubuntu 23.04. We are told testing is easy, and given details on how we can help test. We are shown an installation page from the new Desktop Installer which is being tested, but we're also told the legacy (ubiquity) installer also still needs testing. Links for how we can communicate with others involved in testing are provided, along with many links if you're new to testing.

Sean Davis tells us that Xubuntu Minimal went live in February 2023. We are reminded this was known as Xubuntu Core previously, and what the purpose of this is, given some comparison sizes (compared with Xubuntu Desktop ISOs), and told we can try it now. We are next reminded of the removal of Flatpaks & given a link showing how easy they are to use on Xubuntu. We're also told Xubuntu is now on Mastodon, along with details on the changes to packages that have occurred, before reminding us to help with Ubuntu 23.04 Testing week.

This post reminds us what Kubuntu is, and that it's made many package types available to Kubuntu users in the past. We are told Canonical and the Ubuntu Technical Board have chosen to support only snaps on initial install. A link is made to community member arraybolt3’s post, who discusses issues supporting Flatpaks. We are then told Kubuntu can still use flatpaks, they just need to be installed with the required commands given.
