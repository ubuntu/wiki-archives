Canonical's CEO Mark Shuttleworth has said Ubuntu 22.04 LTS will "cement the company's dominance of cloud computing", with assurances that critical security issues will get fixed within 24 hours on Long Term Support Docker Image Portfolio. "The overarching goal is to provide organizations with a set of container images that have been vetted", with it easier to replace the whole container than deal with patching flaws within it.

==== Ubuntu Founder Explains Why Distro Won’t Support Flatpak ====

Joey Sneddon writes that in a recent "Q&A to celebrate the recent Ubuntu 22.04 release", Ubuntu's Mark Shuttleworth was asked if Ubuntu would consider shipping Flatpak support 'out of the box' by default. Mark gave an answer: "No". Mark outlined his reasoning, highlighting security and "integrity of execution", before adding that many developers & consumers prefer the "simplicity" of Snaps. Mark also acknowledged some areas where snaps need improvement. Joey notes the widening gap in package availability with Commercial and proprietary software, preferring Canonical's Snap store. However, many open-source software developers prefer Flatpak/Flathub, and that Ubuntu users can use Flatpak easily anyway.
