==== Launchpad News: Git-to-Git imports ====

Colin Watson notes that Launchpad has had Git-to-Bazaar and some other code imports since 2009, which helped aid Launchpad's original mission of tracking free software. He says that as of last year direct Git hosting support was added, and now Launchpad supports Git-to-Git code imports, otherwise known as Git mirroring. replacing many Git-to-Bazaar imports.

Adam Stokes informs us that Localhost (LXD) is now a supported cloud type for deployment in the Canonical distribution of Kubernetes. He says that it's confined within LXD containers, is managed by Juju and that with the aid of conjure-up, a Kubernetes implementation can be deployed on a public cloud like AWS, GCE or Azure in about twenty minutes. Adam shows us the commands and some screenshots to help us understand the process.

==== Ubuntu 16.10 & Unity 8 overview ====

Dedoimedo reviews the latest release of Ubuntu, 16.10 Yakkety Yak, evaluating several aspects, including installation and package management, default applications, and making Unity 8 usable. They highlight some of the problems with scopes and in their conclusion they write: “There's truly nothing exciting in Yakkety Yak, so at least this hybrid concept brings in some color into a dreary, rainy, foggy, smoggy reality. But it needs a lot more work. A lot more.”

http://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/ubuntu-yak-unity-8.html

==== What’s In Store for Unity 8 in Ubuntu 17.04 (And Beyond) ====

Joey-Elijah Sneddon of OMG! Ubuntu! assures us that the development of Unity 8, which was introduced in Ubuntu 16.10, will be refined to “deliver a truly converged desktop experience.” He quotes from a recent Q&A session at the recent Ubuntu Online Summit which indicates that there is now a heavy focus on developing Unity 8. Joey shows us a screenshot of what we might expect to see and quotes Canonical’s Will Cooke as saying: “by 18.04 everything will be Snaps and Unity 8 all the way down.”

http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2016/11/ubuntu-1704-zesty-unity-8

Michael Larabel of Phoronix and Marius Nestor of Softpedia wrote similar posts about how future releases of Ubuntu and Unity 8 will look:

==== Linux Kernel 4.9 Lands in Ubuntu 17.04's Proposed Repositories, Based on RC5 ====

Marius Nestor of Softpedia informs us that the recently released 4.9 RC5 kernel is available in the proposed channel of Ubuntu 17.04 which is due for release in April 2017. He says that the kernel should land in the stable repositories soon but predicts that Ubuntu 17.04 might actually ship with a later 4.10 kernel.

==== This new Ubuntu Linux laptop has a 4K screen and Nvidia Pascal GPU ====

Agam Shah, writing for Tech``World, briefly reviews System76’s 15.6-inch Oryx Pro laptop with a 4K screen which is preloaded with either Ubuntu 16.04 or 16.10, and is priced between US $1,499 and $7,012 depending on configuration. He makes a short comparison to Dell’s XPS13, highlights some of the hardware features and notes that the laptop uses a Intel Skylake chip rather than the newer Kaby Lake chips.

==== Mozilla Firefox 50.0 Web Browser Lands in All Supported Ubuntu OSes, Update Now ====

Marius Nestor, writing for Softpedia, informs us that Firefox 50.0 is available in all of the officially supported Ubuntu repositories. He says that the release is not a major update but as a total of 18 security fixes have been addressed we should update as soon as possible.

==== Kubuntu 16.10 Yakkety Yak - Cautiously good? ====

Dedoimedo reviews the latest release of Kubuntu, 16.10 Yakkety Yak, evaluating several aspects, including various parts of the Live Session, the installation and package management, default applications and customization. They highlight some of the problems and in their conclusion write: “Kubuntu 16.10 Yakkety Yak is nothing to be proud of, but it is an okay Plasma release that has redeemed a whole generation of failed distributions in the past year or so.”
