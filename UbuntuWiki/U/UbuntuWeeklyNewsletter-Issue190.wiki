==== Announcing the Release Candidate for Ubuntu 10.04 LTS ====

The Ubuntu team is pleased to announce the Release Candidate for Ubuntu
10.04 LTS (Long-Term Support) Desktop and Server Editions and Ubuntu 10.04
LTS Server for Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud (UEC) and Amazon's EC2, as well as
Ubuntu 10.04 Netbook Edition.  Codenamed "Lucid Lynx", 10.04 LTS continues
Ubuntu's proud tradition of integrating the latest and greatest open source
technologies into a high-quality, easy-to-use Linux distribution.

We consider this release candidate to be complete, stable, and suitable for
testing by any user.

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS Desktop Edition and Ubuntu 10.04 Netbook Edition continue
the trend of ever-faster boot speeds, with improved startup times and a
streamlined, smoother boot experience.

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS Server Edition provides even better integration of the
Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud, with its install-time cloud setup.

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS Server for UEC and EC2 brings the power and stability of
the Ubuntu Server Edition to cloud computing, whether you're using Amazon
EC2 or your own Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud.

The Ubuntu 10.04 family of variants, Kubuntu, Xubuntu, Edubuntu, Ubuntu
Studio, and Mythbuntu, also reach beta status today.

The final release of Ubuntu 10.04 LTS is scheduled for 29 April 2010 and
will be supported for three years on desktops and five years on servers.

Before installing or upgrading to Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, please review the
instructions and caveats in the release notes:

http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes/1004

In addition, there are a small number of known bugs in the release candidate
that will be fixed before the Ubuntu 10.04 LTS release, but warrant
highlighting for your attention:

http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes/1004overview#Known%20issues

The purpose of the Release Candidate is to solicit one last round of testing
before the final release. Here are ways that you can help:

* Upgrade from Ubuntu 8.04 LTS or Ubuntu 9.10 to the Release Candidate by
   following the instructions in the release notes referenced above.

* Participate in installation testing using the Release Candidate CD
   images, by following the testing and reporting instructions at
   http://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/ISO

To upgrade to Ubuntu 10.04 LTS Release Candidate from Ubuntu 9.10 or Ubuntu
8.04 LTS, follow these instructions:

==== Call for UDS Plenaries and Lightning Talks ====

Jorge Castro posted to the ubuntu-devel mailing list the the call for UDS the hour after lunch we have plenaries. These are typically broken up into 4 15 minute talks, but can be combined for longer talks for a total of 16 plenaries. If you're interested in giving a talk, sign up here:

https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UDS-M/Plenaries

Jorge has also added a "talks you'd like to see" section. This spot is for you to fill out. Please take this opportunity to throw team members under the bus ... er, or rather encourage them to share their knowledge.

Like last time on Friday instead of plenaries we'll have Lightning Talks. These will be 5 minutes long and we need as many diverse topics as possible. By Friday we'll be dead tired, so if you remember jml's "Code like a Rockstar" pep talk this is exactly the kind of energy we're looking for to motivate everyone to finish off strong. For more information see link below:

==== Ubuntu Launchpad Single-Sign-On Now Open Source ====

Jono Bacon[1] (Ubuntu Community Manager) announced on his blog [2]:-

Some time back we made Launchpad available as Open Source, and we have gone on to see a wonderful and thriving Launchpad development community flourish there.

One component in particular that was not made available as Open Source [3], was the Canonical Identity Provider which is used by the Launchpad Single Sign On and Ubuntu Single Sign on facilities. I am pleased to announce that we are now able to provide this code under an AGPL3 license. Thanks to Stuart Metcalfe who has been coordinating the technical and licensing work to be able to contribute this change.

You can grab the code from this Launchpad project page [4].

==== Ubuntu's success at Anime Boston 2010! ====

The Ubuntu Massachusetts Lo`` Co team played an instrumental part in the success of Anime Boston 2010.
Reactions came from people who already used Ubuntu, knew someone who used Ubuntu, had heard of Ubuntu, and even those who had never heard of Ubuntu.  Overheard "Who needs Windows 7!?"  This comment from passersby at the Anime Boston convention. Along with passing out fliers, about 550 CDs, and 1000 copies of the Ubuntu Manga they even did 5 live installs.  Overall, it was quite a success.  For more information and pictures of the event please see link below:

==== LoCo Stories: the Asturian team drives the Asturian Language Academy migration to Ubuntu ====

The Ubuntu Asturian Lo``Co has prompted the Asturian Language Academy to move to Ubuntu.  Asturian is a language used in the Northern region of Spain, and has not achieved formal recognition as a coexistent language.  The event that started the migration was a press conference held on April 9th that was covered by television, radio and newspapers.  This was a "move that sets an important milestone in the introduction of Ubuntu in the regional government of Asturies, to be hopefully followed by other governmental bodies."  The even closed with a demonstration of Ubuntu in the Asturian language.  More information is available at the link below:

==== Ubuntu Turkey LoCo Team Interviews Canonical CTO, Matt Zimmerman ====

Canonical CTO Matt Zimmerman was recently in Turkey, and the Turkey Lo``Co had an opportunity to interview him.  A number of questions were asked, including (but not limited to):
* Can your briefly tell us what did you present in FSF days?
* Where do you see yourself in relation to Free Software and Open Source, now and in the past?
* What are the targets and the plans of Ubuntu project in five years?
* Ubuntu makes radical changes like moving the window buttons to the left side and removing Gimp from default applications. How do you decide those changes? Do you evaluate all relevant factors like the community’s opinion?
* Will Canonical make alliances with computer vendors for Ubuntu’s being at many computers, for instance are we going to see the computers that have been installed Ubuntu at Ubuntu Shop?
* We have lots of ATI driver complaints. Does Canonical take steps in the direction of ATI drivers?
* Do you have plans for cell phones? In after days, are we going to play music and videos or view pictures that we have transferred to the cloud from our computers by connecting to Ubuntu One account?

The answers to these and other questions are available at this link.

=== Launchpad News ===

==== Launchpad in the second half of 2010 ====

Want to see what Launchpad is thinking of for the rest of the year?  Launchpad’s Strategist, Jonathan Lange suggests four areas that he feels are important to Launchpad users:
* Privacy and permissions model - "It’s currently tangled up with the way we send emails to people, and we’d love to untangle them."
* Making Launchpad faster - the Foundations team is already working on this
* Derivative distributions - Linux distributions that extends or customizes another one, generally Ubuntu
* Ubuntu Software Center - "Launchpad occupies a special place in the Software Center world, since it can help make it easier to get applications for your desktop and make it easier to develop those applications."

==== Jono Bacon: Lucid Community Team Review ====

One thing I have been working hard to continue to grow and refine with each cycle is how I manage my team at Canonical, the projects that we are working on, and how we coordinate ours and other projects with the wider community. As I have focused on improving this project management approach, I have been working to help better structure and plan our projects.

While I started doing this with my team specifically, I was keen to see if I could improve this in the wider community too. As such, at the last Ubuntu Developer Summit I worked to better socialize the idea of teams developing a firm idea of what they want to achieve in a cycle, planning that work out, assigning the work across the wider team and making steady progress on those goals throughout the cycle.

To do this I encouraged teams to build roadmaps with a core set of goals, divide those goals into blueprints and to track actions inside those blueprints. Some teams embraced this more structured approach and were successful in achieving their goals.

As part of this work I approved a set of blueprints that I would manage as part of my team. This core set of blueprints, a mix of my team’s and other community goals, set the primary goals and workflow for my team throughout the cycle, and my role was to keep everything on track. Then by using a burndown chart we tracted the progress of the blueprints. this experiment demonstrated to me that the tool is useful for helping raise the opportunity for success.

As such, in the Maverick cycle I am going to use the same approach, but continue to encourage more community participation in these structured blueprints. I think that the burndown approach not only helps me guide all these projects and keep them on track with a regular flow of achievements, but it also helps raise my visibility on the different actions which helps me easily identify the next pieces of low-hanging fruit and coordinate with the community around completion of those tasks and unblocking any problems.

For a list of the blueprints for Lucid, and the burndown chart see link below:

==== Martin Owens: Ground Control 1.6 and Website ====

Doctor``Mo is pleased to announce the release of Ground Control 1.6, these feature features minor improvements and fixes but the main change is fixing the launchpad openid problem that stopped all new users of ground control from enjoying the integration. He is also pleased to announce the new ground control website[1] which was very kindly designed by Brett Alton, and produced by himself for this release. You can get the new version 1.6 from the download link on the website, please use the latest PPA, as the version in Lucid is 1.5, and still suffers from the launchpad openid login bug.

Any thoughts and comments please post them here, but any bugs please post them to the launchpad bug tracker. https://bugs.launchpad.net/groundcontrol

==== Oliver Grawert: Unleash the Beagles !!! ====

Over the last few weeks the mobile (mainly me, Ogra) and the kernel team (mainly amit) of Ubuntu made some effort to bring up an image for the awesome TI OMAP3 Beagleboard. Since we literally only had a few weeks and it is already been late in the release cycle when we started the images will have more rough edges than the other ARM images we provide. Also the board only has 256M of RAM so using a Netbook image, even though it is already slightly optimized for low-end systems and ARM usage it will surely use swap on your system if you try it out. So if you have a Beagleboard, go to https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ARM/Beagle any try out one of the images, if you dont have one yet, GET ONE !!! Its fun and you can help out ubuntu on ARM!

==== Martin Owens: 200 Artist/Designers! ====

According to Doctor``Mo, a Ubuntu artists community has been developing over the past couple of months. He's very impressed that it now contains 200 members who can post images to the galleries and 268 watchers (people who can’t post but who do see other people’s work). If you have an article or piece of news that you’d like relayed to this burgeoning Ubuntu artists community, do let him know right away and he’ll post it as a blog entry. They’ve already posted entries about gimp ui changes, inkscape competition and mypaint guides. They are looking for more contributions and sharing of methods, as they don’t get many icon makers either considering the number of them making lovely graphics.

==== Ubuntu 10.04 delivers usability, strength ====

IT World's Brian Proffitt says what finally convinced him that Ubuntu was worthy of the average desktop user: Proffitt installed it on his Mom's computer. Actually, this happened quite some time ago, so this is not necessarily news. But it's key to note that Proffitt indicated "average" desktop user. While he says he was very willing to recommend Ubuntu for users who just needed to handle day-to-day operations like surfing, e-mail, word processing, and the like, Proffitt was personally holding back from using it himself, preferring instead to use open``SUSE, which enabled me to complete more advanced tasks, like video editing and conversion, pretty easily. Earlier versions of Ubuntu gave the feel of a pretty, shiny face over the old existing Linux strengths and limitations. Ubuntu 10.04 delivers a sense of a strong, cohesive operating system underneath. Beauty, for Ubuntu, has at last become more than skin deep.

==== Ubuntu 10.04 Release Candidate Available ====

Jamie of ZDNet just installed the "desktop" 64-bit release and the "netbook" 32-bit release yesterday. Setting aside the controversy over some of the technical decisions and changes Ubuntu has made, and looking only at installation, cosmetics and simple functionality, Ubuntu has once again done an excellent job. Installation is smooth and easy and most, if not all, of the installation screens have been reworked and significantly improved in terms of both ease of understanding and use. When Jamie compares this RC to a couple of releases ago, it is a huge improvement, and looks very good.

==== Ubuntu 10.04 Release Candidate Is Here ====

Phoronix's Michael Larabel notes that for those interested, distributions as part of the Ubuntu family (Kubuntu, Xubuntu, et al) have also been updated to their Lucid Lynx release candidate status. The mailing list announcement with all of the download links can be found on the Ubuntu mailing list. [1] By now most everyone should be familiar with Ubuntu 10.04 "Lucid Lynx", so there is not much more to say. The final release of this Long-Term Support release is expected a week from today.

==== 50 Places Linux is Running That You Might Not Expect ====

Focus.com recalls that it was not long ago when Microsoft Windows had a tight stranglehold on the operating system market. Walk into a Circuit City or Staples, it seemed, and virtually any computer you took home would be running the most current flavor of Windows. In the last decade, though, the operating system market has begun to change. Slightly more than 5% of all computers now run Mac, according to Net``Market``Share.com. Linux is hovering just beneath 1% of the overall market share in operating systems. And although that might sound like a small number, Linux is far more than just a fringe OS. In fact, it's running in quite a few more places than you probably suspect. Focus.com then goes on to list fifty places where Linux is running in place of Windows or Mac, including places like the French parliament which opted in November 2006 to dump Windows in favor of Ubuntu Linux. According to Macedonia's ministry of education and science, every student in Macedonia uses a computer workstations powered by Ubuntu Linux, as part of that country's "A Computer For Every Child" program. Other places such as the Philippines, Georgia, Google, Wikipedia, and some systems from Dell all use Ubuntu. Follow this link to see a number of other places currently running Ubuntu.

==== Ubuntu 10.04 Is Hit By Major X.Org Memory Leak ====

Michael Larabel of Phoronix tips us off that Ubuntu 10.04 LTS is set to be released next Thursday and a release candidate was just released on April 22nd, but there's some last minute problems within the Lucid Lynx camp. There's a last-minute X.Org Server update that's being looked at as a result of a "major memory leak" that has been found over the past week. An X.Org Server update that was pushed into the Lucid repository last week has resulted in the system being slower and slower as its left on until it reaches a point where the system is no longer usable. The memory leak was tracked down to a set of patches that were made to fix some program crashes when the X.Org Server began supporting GLX 1.4. The bug surrounding this X.Org memory leak is titled GEM objects not deallocated [1] in reference to the Graphics Execution Manager. There's also details surrounding this troublesome regression on the Ubuntu Wiki via the GEM``Leak page. [2] A message in regards to this problem has also been written to the ubuntu-devel mailing list [3] classifying this as an urgent problem.

==== Ubuntu Lucid Lynx 10.04 RC released on time ====

Bob Mattes reviewed the Ubuntu 10.04. He says he doesn't find huge differences from Beta 2. The icons are the same as Beta 2 and the window controls are still all on the left side. He provides a short list of some of the included software and a review of Rythymbox and the Ubuntu One Music store. He shows how easy it is to use the music store and how well it syncs to his MP3 player. He mentions the new Nvidia drivers.

He also briefly discusses Kubuntu 10.04 and some of the changes, from 9.10, including that, like Ubuntu, the system tray icons now change colors for alerts.

==== Ubuntu Manual Project To Release Quickstart Booklets For Ubuntu 10.10 ====

Benjamin Humphrey announces the work being done to keep the Ubuntu Manual up to date. He explains the quality control going into the second edition and states he wants the second edition to be 100% error free. For 10.10 he says that the Ubuntu Manual project will not only keep to its same high quality, but add an Ubuntu Quickstart booklet that can be handed out by Lo``Co teams and other groups at events. There will also be improvements to Quickstart to make things easier both for the Ubuntu Manual project and to make it easier for other projects to use Quickstart. Benjamin's final goal for the project is to make it more efficient and work hard to make the project as easy as possible for newcomers to get involved with.

==== Ubuntu: How to Measure Canonical’s Business Progress ====

Joe Panettieri of WorksWithU has some suggestions for how Canonical can better estimate its success as a business and share that information. He thinks that the fact that there are an estimated 12 million users of Ubuntu is great, however, would like to see more information out there to build momentum to allow the company to grow more.

His ideas:
1. Create some sort of phone home process for Ubuntu so that more accuracy can be achieved in estimating userbase
2. Start disclosing how many Ubuntu systems are being managed worldwide by the SaaS version of Landscape, or disclose the growth percentage as more systems are being managed.
3. Open up the information about Ubuntu One. This could mean showing how much storage is being used on a quarterly basis rather than specific information about how many users (or paying users) there are. He also would like to see stats on the Ubuntu One Music Store use as it becomes available.

==== Ubuntu Improved Enough… No Desire for Windows anymore! ====

Ed Hewitt has the solutions he needs to now be able to use only Ubuntu and not Windows. This has come due to two things. First, he managed to fix a problem he has had for several Ubuntu releases where his monitor has not be detected correctly. After several years of having the problem, he filed a bug when the work around he'd used in the past stopped working. He ultimately, however, decided to see if he could fix it on his own and was successful. The second thing which has made it possible for Ed to say he can stop using Windows is the fact that it looks the Steam gaming platform will be coming to Linux. He's a gamer and it was one of the last things holding him back.

==== Canonical Training Set To Announce New Ubuntu Certified Professional Certification ====

Amber Graner, writing in Ubuntu User, notes that a new certification program is being introduced.  The Ubuntu Certified Professional (UCP) course will be based on Ubuntu 10.04, Lucid Lynx, and joins such other courses offered by Canonical and Authorised Training Partners.  This information comes from a telephone interview with Billy Cina, Director of Training for Canonical.  Billy says, "No prior Linux experience is necessary; IT/system administration experience is a must".  Furthermore, it no longer requires students to take the LPIC-1 exams in addition to the Ubuntu 199 exam in order to become certified.

==== Canonical and MuleSoft partner to improve Tomcat packaging ====

The H Online reports that middleware specialist Mule``Soft, formerly Mulesource, has announced that it has partnered with Ubuntu sponsor Canonical. Under the agreement, Mule``Soft will help to improve the Apache Tomcat packaging for Ubuntu and Debian. COO of Canonical Matt Asay said that, “We share Mule``Soft’s goal in improving the experience for users of open source software,” adding that, “The work that Mule``Soft is doing will dramatically simplify the installation, configuration and use of Tomcat for the Debian and Ubuntu communities.” The two companies hope that the contributions will improve the "out-of-the-box" usability of Tomcat in the upcoming Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, in Debian 6.0 "Squeeze" and future releases. Improvements to the Tomcat packaging – the latest stable 6.0.24 release – include Authbind as the standard method for binding Tomcat to ports lower than 1024, defaulting the security manager to the disabled state and implementing restarts with the init script. Additionally, the JSVC set of libraries and applications is no longer used by the package.

==== Canonical open sources Launchpad and Ubuntu Single Sign On code ====

The H Online advises us that Canonical, sponsor of the Ubuntu project, has announced that its Canonical Identity Provider code is now available as open source. The CIP Single Sign On (SSO) authentication software is a component that was not made available last July when Launchpad, the site and software that drives Canonical's open source and project collaboration, was open sourced. Canonical Identity Provider is part of Canonical Identity Systems, which is a series of projects to support Canonical's Open``ID-based SSO platform, and is currently used by both the Launchpad and Ubuntu Single Sign On facilities. More details about the Canonical Identity Provider can be found on the project's Launchpad page [1] (login required). Canonical Identity Provider code is released under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License [2] (AGPLv3).
