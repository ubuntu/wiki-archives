== General ==
We are hosting regular hangouts on http://ubuntuonair.com/. They often take the form of a brief and informal interview, follwed by Q&A from the audience. Sometimes they are discussions as well, or regular presentations. Whatever you might want to talk about, let us know. If it's about UbuntuDevelopment in the broadest sense, we'll make time for you. Talk to LaunchpadHome:dholbach or LaunchpadHome:joseeantonior

== Schedule ==
