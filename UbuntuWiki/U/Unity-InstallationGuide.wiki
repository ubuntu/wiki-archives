__TOC__


== Unity Installation Guide ==

This page documents how you can try out Unity 3.0 on your Ubuntu system.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <style="background:Orange">Note: This software is pre-alpha. You should be comfortable with being able to downgrade multiple packages if you want to go back to a stable desktop, otherwise we recommend not trying this on a production machine. Alpha 1 will have a more stable version.
|}

=== Limitations and Tips ===

* This version of Unity does NOT have Places or the Dash, these will come back for Alpha 2.
* It's normal that clicking on the Ubuntu button does nothing.
* The session to log in in GDM is now "Ubuntu Desktop"
* For now, be sure to use Humanity or Humanity-Dark icon themes. Others will cause Unity 3.0 alpha to crash.

=== Natty ===

Unity is available in Natty .

<pre>
sudo apt-get install unity
</pre>

Then restart Compiz or log out and log back into your desktop session. Finally start CompizConfig Settings Manager (/usr/bin/ccsm) and then search for and enable the Unity plugin!

=== What to do when it Crashes ===

As this is prealpha code it can crash sometimes, unchecking the Unity plugin in CCSM will stop unity from running.
