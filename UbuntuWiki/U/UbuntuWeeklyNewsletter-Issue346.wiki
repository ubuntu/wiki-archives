=== In The Blogosphere ===

==== Canonical: Ubuntu TV Lives, But Linux Smartphones Come First ====

The VAR Guy writes what may be self-evident for anyone keeping an eye on Ubuntu TV, that it has been, as Jono Bacon explained, ‘put on something of a backburner’ as compared to other projects, including Ubuntu for smartphones.

==== Canonical Working To Bring Weather Channel App to Ubuntu Touch ====

==== Ubuntu to include torrent search in Dash search ====

Varghese Chacko of Muktware writes that users of Ubuntu will soon be able to search for torrents right from the Unity dash via the upcoming torrent lens which will be included by default. After initial hesitancy by its author David Calle due to torrents sometimes dubious legality, Mark Shuttleworth gave the OK on Google+ writing “David, let’s go ahead. The tool is super-useful and it’s perfectly justified to make it available by default. We use Torrents for distributing ubuntu itself. So please don’t hold back!”
