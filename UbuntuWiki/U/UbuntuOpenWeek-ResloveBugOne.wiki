Description of UbuntuOpenWeek/ResloveBugOne here.

Mark Shuttleworth filed <nowiki>[[Bug One in launchpad as "Microsoft has majority market share."|https:--bugs.launchpad.net-ubuntu-+bug-1]]</nowiki>

Ubuntu is a desktop operating system which is making great strides to resolving this bug, but this is only part of the solution.

Microsoft has majority market share in 3 sectors:
1. Desktop operating system
2. Browser
3. Office Suite

On Friday November 6, a <nowiki>[[Ubuntu Open Week |https:--wiki.ubuntu.com-UbuntuOpenWeek]]</nowiki> BethLynnEicher will discuss what bug one means to us and what we can do as a community about it.
