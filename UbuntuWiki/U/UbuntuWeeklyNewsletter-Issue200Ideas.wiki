These are exciting times for Ubuntu and our community, and you can help contribute by joining the Ubuntu Newsletter Team. Some ways to join or contribute are listed below.
UWN mailing list: One way to get started is to join the mailing list and post an introduction. We can then help guide you on how to get started working for our publication. https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/Ubuntu-news-team
UWN IRC channel: Anyone can drop by the UWN news channel and ask how they can help. Just join #ubuntu-news on freenode and introduce yourself.
