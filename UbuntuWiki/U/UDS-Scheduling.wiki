== Scheduling Meetings ==

If you are a scheduler, you will need to be listed as a <nowiki>[[http://summit.ubuntu.com/uos-1511/tracks|Track Lead]]</nowiki> in Summit, and be logged in. Then, from the <nowiki>[[http://summit.ubuntu.com/uos-1511/|uos-1511 page]]</nowiki>, you will have an "Actions" box on the side of the screen with a "Schedule Meetings" link.  

<nowiki>[[File:Actions_schedule-meetings.png]]</nowiki>

Clicking that will bring you to the manual scheduling interface, where you will be able to schedule the meetings for your track (and only your track) by dragging the meeting block from the Unscheduled side-bar to an open room and time slot.

If your scheduling causes a scheduling conflict, it will notify you which person has the conflict.
