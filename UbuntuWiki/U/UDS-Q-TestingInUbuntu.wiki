We'll be hosting the first ever Testing in Ubuntu Birds of a Feather session at UDS-P.  This event is heavily inspired by the <nowiki>[[http://us.pycon.org/2011/openspaces/TestingBOF/|Pycon TiP BoF]]</nowiki>, and it will follow much the same format of opening remarks, followed by lightning round talks.

| Plenary Room

| I'm hungry:
| Pizza and beer will be provided

If you are going to be at UDS, and want to give a quick, 5 minute talk on something cool you've learned about or developed for '''automated''' testing, do sign up below.  You do not have to give a talk in order to attend.  The talks do not have to be about Ubuntu specifically, but should be useful to those developing Ubuntu infrastructure.
