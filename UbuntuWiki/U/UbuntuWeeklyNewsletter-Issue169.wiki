==== Lucid Ubuntu Developer Summit Videos ====

The Ubuntu Developer Summits have always been very open and participatory events, but this year they are going a step further than in previous years. On top of the audio streams, gobby documents, separate IRC channels, blueprints and wiki pages they also had many sessions video recorded. The videos are available in both Ogg Video format and flash, so we can reach a wide and diverse audience of interested parties. Below are direct links to the Ogg Video. To download any or all of the various videos please visit the Ubuntu Developers Blip.tv Channel: http://ubuntudevelopers.blip.tv/ , the Youtube channel: http://youtube.com/user/ubuntudevelopers , or the Miro Ubuntu Community: http://ubuntu.mirocommunity.com/

==== Matthew Helmke: Heading Home from UDS-L ====

The Ubuntu Developer Summit has ended and I’m on my way home. Ubuntu 10.04 LTS is going to be an incredible release and I’m proud to have participated a little bit in the process. I’ll be writing more about it as time passes. For now, enjoy the group photo at the link below.

==== Joe Baker: An Interview with Richard Johnson (nixternal) ====

The next interview in the series comes from somebody who I’ve never really spoken to personally (well…until now), but who I’ve heard a lot of people talking about/referring to. To me, this shows the extraordinary amount of work that he’s put into Ubuntu/Kubuntu. Some of you have probably heard of him for something more recent…which I won’t spoil. The interview covers, personal info, how and when he started using computers, his involvement with Ubuntu, his best memories, advocacy, and tips for new users. You can read the full interview at the link below.

==== Martin Pitt: Nicer Launchpad upstream releases with lp-project-upload ====

A while ago Martin Pitt introduced a script lp-project-upload to automate tarball release uploads to Launchpad. http://www.piware.de/2009/09/automated-release-tarball-upload-to-launchpad/

Many people asked for further features, two of which Martin has added now: First, it automatically invokes gpg to create a tarball signature (unless one is already present), and second it invokes an editor to specify changelog and release notes (just keep the files empty if you don’t need them). Uploaded to lucid’s ubuntu-dev-tools.

==== 20 Essential Tips Every Ubuntu User Should Know ====

Maximum PC's Will Kraft says so you've read Maximum PC's Complete Beginner's Guide to Linux and have decided to adopt an open-source operating system--congratulations! But diving right into a new OS is daunting, even if it is as polished and stable as Ubuntu. That's OK though, because they're here to help. He has compiled a list of the 20 most important skills that every Ubuntu user should have. These tips, ranging from basic GUI manipulation to advanced system recovery, are essential to your Windows-free computing experience. Whether you've just installed Ubuntu for the first time or have been a Linux acolyte for years, you'll want to read our refresher. Follow this link for these 20 tips: http://www.maximumpc.com/article/features/20_essential_tips_every_ubuntu_user_should_know

==== Canonical working on an iTunes-like music store for Ubuntu? ====

Lee Mathews of Download Squad says the one program people he knows miss when they've tried to switch to Linux is i``Tunes. Like it or not, Apple's desktop app has gained the reputation of being the place to buy music and video downloads. But i``Tunes on Linux? Fuhgettaboutit. That leaves an opportunity for someone in the Linux community to step up and deliver an alternative. Enter Canonical, who may be preparing to do just that in time for the release of Lucid Lynx. Over at Launch``Pad, there's a blueprint called Ubuntu One Music Store which states its goal as "to deliver the ability to purchase music from within a desktop music player." There's nothing much yet for details on the associated wiki, so there's no telling yet what exactly might be in the works. Even if the Ubuntu One Music Store ends up being an affiliate app powered by Amazon, it could provide a decent revenue stream for Canonical. It's also one more feature that could entice users to give Linux a try on their desktop. http://www.downloadsquad.com/2009/11/17/canonical-working-on-an-i``Tunes-like-music-store-for-ubuntu/

==== Good karma: an in-depth review of Ubuntu 9.10 ====

ARS Technica's Ryan Paul reminds us that Ubuntu 9.10, codenamed Karmic Koala, was officially released last month. In this comprehensive review, Ars takes you under the surface for an in-depth look at the new features and major architectural changes. Karmic Koala, climbed down from the tree last month with new features and updated software. For five years and eleven releases, the Ubuntu Linux distribution has delivered a capable desktop operating system built largely on open source software. The new version is another important step forward for Ubuntu and its corporate backer Canonical. Ubuntu has achieved a level of popularity that is unprecedented for a desktop Linux distribution. It has gained an enormous following among open source software enthusiasts and is even beginning to attract some mainstream recognition. The Karmic release continues Ubuntu's march forward and will raise the bar a notch for other desktop distributions. http://arstechnica.com/open-source/reviews/2009/11/good-karma-ars-reviews-ubuntu-910.ars?utm_source=rss

==== Head to Head: Windows 7 vs Ubuntu 9.10 ====

Benny Har-Even of IT Pro points out that Windows 7 turns to face its latest challenger in the form of Ubuntu 9.10, the latest and greatest flavor of Linux to be released. "It’s with some trepidation then that we pitch the most recently updated flavour of Linux, Ubuntu 9.10 Karmic Koala, against the new mainstream choice that is Windows 7." There’s no great revelation is saying the Windows 7 is a fine operating system that is going to remain the default choice for most, even though it costs money. However, for a business, if your strategy is to try and avoid Microsoft, end users could be worse off than being stuck with Ubuntu 9.10. If you look hard enough, there’s nothing your Windows machine can do that your Ubuntu one can’t. As much as Har-Even says he likes Windows 7, he can’t help but be impressed with what’s on offer in Karmic Koala and if you’ve never tried Linux then it’s an easy and relatively painless place to start. http://www.itpro.co.uk/617848/head-to-head-windows-7-vs-ubuntu-9-10

==== Kubuntu 9.10 Karmic Koala is really nice ====

Dodeimedo.com says if you have read his Ubuntu 9.10 review last week, you must have noticed his reaction to the latest Ubuntu release was rather lukewarm. This makes today's Kubuntu review all the more intriguing. First, is there and why is there any difference between Ubuntu and Kubuntu, after all, they are pretty much the same distro? Then, what are these differences and are they any good? Kubuntu 9.10 Karmic Koala is very, very nice. It's a pleasant surprise. And it's better than Ubuntu. It is not without issues, but they are mostly cosmetic and related to KDE. If you're considering trying the latest Ubuntu release, I'd say try Kubuntu. It's lovely, polished, smooth, runs well, and will cooperate with your hardware. You will also get a decent array of programs to begin with, plus lots of eye candy to please you while you grunt over and smooth the bumps you find along the way. http://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/kubuntu-9-10.html

==== GIMP To Be Removed From Lucid; F-Spot Has Challengers ====

OMGUbuntu.com reports that the decision has been taken, and it seemed pretty final that The GIMP will not be included in Ubuntu Lucid by default. The decisions behind this are based on a few factors:

*** the general user doesn't use it
*** its user-interface is too complex
*** it's an application for professionals
*** desktop users just want to edit photos and they can do that in F-Spot
*** it's a photoshop replacement and photoshop isn't included by default in Windows...
*** it takes up room on the disc

Of course, these are all perfectly valid points, and OMGUbuntu.com says he agrees with most of them. The logic behind this is sound. Desktop users just do not need something as powerful as The GIMP. It takes up space, it's not widely used outside of designers and a simpler "paint" type program would better serve the features it provides that don't overlap with F-Spot. http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2009/11/gimp-to-be-removed-lucid.html

==== How The X Stack In Ubuntu 10.04 LTS May Look ====

Michael Larabel of Phoronix reports that Canonical's Ubuntu Developer Summit for Ubuntu 10.04 LTS (codenamed Lucid Lynx) is taking place this week in Texas, but happening right now on the Ubuntu-X mailing list is a discussion about what the X.Org plans are for Ubuntu Lucid. Bryce Harrington, Canonical's principal X leader, has shared his views about the X.Org package set for Ubuntu 10.04. As far as the X Server goes, Bryce believes it is a question between the 1.6, 1.7, and 1.8 releases. X Server 1.7 has been shipping as part of X.Org 7.5 since early October, but Bryce is still willing to consider using 1.6 in Lucid as an option since it's been tested longer than 1.7. However, X Server 1.6 lacks support for X Input 2.0 / Multi-Pointer X, VGA arbitration, EXA improvements, and many other goodies. Using X Server 1.6 though would likely just be a fall-back scenario if going with X Server 1.7/1.8 does not work in Ubuntu's favor. Right now this is all up in the air but we will see what ends up getting settled for Ubuntu 10.04 LTS and Phoronix will certainly be around with their benchmarks when the time comes. http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=NzcxOQ

==== Mac OS X 10.6.2 vs. Ubuntu 9.10 Benchmarks ====

Phoronix's Michael Larabel recalls that back in August upon the launch of Apple's Snow Leopard he delivered benchmarks comparing Mac OS X 10.5 and Mac OS X 10.6 along with initial benchmarks of how Ubuntu 9.10 was running against Mac OS X 10.6. Since that time though Ubuntu 9.10 has been officially released with various changes since last August and Apple has issued two point releases for Snow Leopard, now putting it at version 10.6.2. As we await the release of Free``BSD 8.0 to deliver a larger operating system comparison, Larabel has carried out a fresh round of tests comparing Mac OS X 10.6.2 and Ubuntu 9.10 (both x86 and x86_64 editions) under a variety of tests. Ubuntu 9.10 (with the 32-bit and 64-bit wins being added together) had won about ten of the sixteen benchmarks in this Mac OS X vs. Ubuntu Linux comparison.http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=macosx106_ubuntu910_final&num=1

==== Ubuntu in truffle shuffle with Chrome OS ====

Kelly Fiveash of The Register reports reports that Ubuntu’s commercial sponsor Canonical revealed late yesterday that it has been working with Google on its Chrome OS platform since before Mountain View announced its game-changing plans in July this year. The firm’s OEM veep Chris Kenyon said in a blog post on Thursday that “Canonical is contributing engineering to Google under contract”. His comments came following Google’s announcement that it would open source the Chrome OS. “While the two operating systems share some core components, Google Chrome OS will provide a very different experience to Ubuntu,” he said. “Ubuntu will continue to be a general purpose OS running both web and native applications such as Open``Office and will not require specialized hardware.” Chrome OS on the other hand will be specifically designed for a hand-picked selection of web-obsessed x86- and (eventually) ARM-based netbooks created by Google’s hardware partners that include big name computer makers such as Hewlett Packard, Asus, Acer, Lenovo. http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/11/20/ubuntu_chrome_os_contract/

==== Ubuntu 9.10: A karmic disconnection ====

William Charles D'Souza of The Business Standard writes that he has always believed that the primary responsibility of an operating system is to work so smoothly that it becomes virtually invisible — functioning without the least bit of hiccup to provide an unobtrusive environment on any computer where other applications come into play. Now imagine if you could have this for free! I mean, the basic version of Microsoft’s Windows 7 costs nearly Rs 6,000. Why pay so much when you can do all your normal tasks on an OS that’s absolutely free for home use? The Linux-based Ubuntu was fast catching up with the Windows on all these parameters, at least till its latest version 9.10 — the ‘Karmic Koala’. D'Souza went onto experience DSL problems during upgrade which soured his opinion of Karmic, but he still likes Ubuntu. "As for me, I am just hoping that somewhere between the fixes and forums, the Karmic gives my MTNL connection back... Then the 9.10 would be the definitive alternative to the Windows. Till then, I would be happy to have my netbook stuck with the good old 9.04 Jaunty." http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/ubuntu-910karmic-disconnection/376597/

==== Dell Shows Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid Lynx Some Love ====

Joe Panettieri, workwithU, gives some early details of Dell beginning to to show "Lucid Lynx Some Love" in this article. "According to Dell's Direct2``Dell website: 'Dell Linux Engineers will hit the road to Dallas, TX to participate in the upcoming Ubuntu Developers Summit for Lucid Lynx (UDS-L).'"  Joe points out the signs of progress between Dell and Canonical with the following:

* Dell and Canonical in mid-September 2009 introduced Ubuntu Moblin Remix Developer Edition on Dell netbooks.
* Canonical CEO Mark Shuttleworth visited Dell’s Austin, Texas headquarters in late September 2009.
* Dell’s U.S. website in October 2009 finally re-introduced a desktop PC with Ubuntu pre-installed.

Joe points out that Dell is studying the Ubuntu 10.04 and LTS release that will be supported by Canonical for 3 years on the desktop and 5 on the server.  Joe sees a lot of potential in the future for this endeavor.  Let's see what comes out from Dell about their involvement in UDS this week.  See what you think read this article full of links and information.

==== Why Ubuntu release schedules should be changed ====

Sam Varaghese wants to see Ubuntu go from a 6 month release schedule to a annual release schedule. The first reason he gives, is so that no showstopping bugs will show up in future releases like they have in 9.04 and 9.10. Second, he points out that with Ubuntu's move to the Debian testing stream instead of the Debian unstable stream will require a slower release schedule. We are also informed of the opinion that the 6 month release schedule is used mainly to give Ubuntu the impression of being in perpetual motion. The third reason given is GNOME's major changes that are planned for 3.0. Sam Varaghese informs us that 1 month between the release of GNOME and Ubuntu's release is not enough time to work out the problems that will arise from the changes in GNOME.

==== Shutdown/Reboot Ubuntu 9.10 ====

J.A. Watson doesn't like the 60-second delay that has been added when you shutdown and reboot in 9.04 and 9.10. We are also told that the option in 9.04 to turn this delay off was missing in 9.10, but he gives us a way to turn this off in the GNOME configuration settings. He then starts what he calls a "rant" and asks why this feature was added, and why the option to turn it off was hidden in the GNOME configuration settings.

==== Ubuntu One Music Store ====

Stefano Forenza notes that Ubuntu is considering a music store for Ubuntu 10.04.  The store would be hooked up to Ubuntu One, thus the name "Ubuntu One Music Store".  He raises a few interesting questions in his blog, such as: what type of commercial agreements were reached with the music companies, what format the music would be in (mp3 or open formats), and what about DRM?

==== Ubuntu One Music Store: A Real Business? ====

Joe Panettieri of Works With U voices his opinion of Ubuntu offering a Music Store in Lucid Lynx.  This, according to Launchpad, is a project to deliver the ability to purchase music from inside a desktop music player.  He goes on to ask 3 questions:

* Can Canonical actually make money from the Ubuntu One Music Store?
* Is the music store something completely new, or is it a simple connection to existing online music stores?
* Is Canonical stretching itself too thin by continuing to launch more and more services.

Joe seems to feel that this is a good move for Ubuntu, as music is a big drawing card for on-line use.

==== Ubuntu's Canonical and Google partner to create Chrome ====

Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols, the Cyber Cynic writing on the Computerworld blogs, announces that Ubuntu is partnering with Google to create Chrome.  This is a major project, under contract, where Canonical is contributing engineering for the netbook operating system.  He feels that this doesn't impact Ubuntu, since Ubuntu is for general purpose machines, and Chrome is for a specific goal on specific hardware.

==== Who Deserves Free Ubuntu CDs More? ====

Christopher Tozzi of Works With U addresses the questions concerning Canonical's move to scale back the Ship-``It program.  It is his opinion that Canonical may be targeting the wrong people.  Free CDs are now being sent only to those who are already Ubuntu members.  But Christopher feels that this may be discriminating against those who don't have the technical ability to burn ISOs, or the bandwidth to download them:  in short, the very people that need the service the most.

==== Ubuntu Netbook Remix to be redubbed Ubuntu Netbook Edition ====

liliputing reports via OMGUbuntu, that Ubuntu Netbook Remix (UNR) is being renamed Ubuntu Netbook Edition (UNE). The fact that the term "remix" implies and "respun" version of the operation system and the word "Edition" would mean a fully supported, fully-featured version of the OS. So what this renaming means is yet to be seem.  Could it be a UNR by any other name is still an UNR or are we looking more in the edition.  Time will tell.  Take a look into the article and the blueprint that it is linked and see what's in store for the Ubuntu Netbook Edition for Ubuntu 10.04, Lucid Lynx.

==== My life with Linux: Day 1 - The daily ups and downs of switching to open source ====

Stuart Turton, writing for Australian PC Authority, begins his odyssey in the Linux world by installing Ubuntu 9.04 at home and Fedora 11 at work.  He was impressed with the Wubi installation, but not with the brown theme of Ubuntu or what he considered the retro menus.  He also wasn't to impressed with the speed of 9.04.  He was impressed with the preselected programs that were installed, as well as the selection of other programs available through Add/``Remove.  After 2 hours, he was feeling right at home with Ubuntu.
