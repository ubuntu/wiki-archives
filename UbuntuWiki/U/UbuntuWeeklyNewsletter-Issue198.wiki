==== Field experiment: fix an Ubuntu bug ====

We want to make it easy to get involved in Ubuntu on a broad basis, but also make it easy to just go ahead and do something as a drive-by contribution.

At UDS we talked a lot about making it easy to just go and fix a bug that bothers you. We did a couple of improvements to our documentation and some other bits here and there.

What I now need is your feedback. It’d be super-sweet if you never just went and fixed a bug in Ubuntu, you now just tried to do that. I don’t want to give too many instructions, because I want to see how you go about finding docs, which tools you use, what you do to make it happen, so the instructions are thus:

* Wear your hardhat.
* Remember an Ubuntu bug that bothered you or find one you’d like to work on
* Take notes. It’s important that you note down what exactly you tried to do, what worked and what didn’t work. We want to fix the process harder and make it super-smooth.
* Add a comment to this blog entry or mail dholbach at ubuntu dot com with your findings.

Thanks a bunch in advance. This is an awesome opportunity for you to not only fix a bug in Ubuntu, but also help fix the process involved.

I’ll report the findings in a couple of weeks.

==== Call For Testing: Karmic Firefox Users (or willing to install Karmic in a VM) ====

The Ubuntu QA team issued the following call for testing on June 18th.

Following up a previous call for testing for Hardy users, we are calling Karmic users to test the Firefox 3.6.4 upgrade.

As we wrote, Firefox 3.0 and xulrunner 1.9 are now unsupported by Mozilla. We are going to release Firefox 3.6.4 as a minor update to the 3.6 series in Lucid. This will also be rolled out to Hardy, Jaunty and Karmic (along with xulrunner 1.9.2.4). The update for Lucid is quite trivial, but the update in Hardy, Jaunty and Karmic is not quite as simple.

Also, we have added a new testcase "Xul``Runner Applications" aiming to test that the applications using xulrunner keep working correctly after the update. These applications need to be tested both in Hardy and Karmic.

Please, check the testing instructions if you are willing to help with this important security update.

==== Community Leadership Summit 2010 ====

The Community Leadership Summit 2010 will be kicking off in Portland, Oregon; taking place the weekend before OSCON. The event takes place on 17th – 18th July 2010.

http://ubuntu-us.org/?q=node/14370

==== Upcoming M Cycle Re Approvals ====

Just to clarify the Lo``Co Council will be contacting teams for reapproval this cycle, they were chosen at random.  As you can imagine the list of teams is large and this process only started last cycle. If your team is ON THIS LIST

https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LoCoCouncil/LoCoTeamReApproval

Then you will receive an email from us regarding the re approval process. Every team at some stage will go through this process.

If you've any other queries just ask us, there are 6 of us on the council and are here to help you where we can.
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LoCoCouncil

https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/loco-contacts/2010-June/004579.html

==== LoCo Team Expiration ====

If you see that your team is expiring from Launchpad and it's only been a year, _PLEASE_ notify one of the council members, or the council list ASAP. The council list is loco-council@lists.ubuntu.com _PLEASE_ check this.

We are holding re-approvals every two years, not every year, so your team _will_ fall off the launchpad 'approved' group if we do not take action. This is change from years past, so the approval lengths are not set correctly yet. In the future we will script something to take care of this, but for now please be aware of the issue.

==== Cassidy: Linux could ease schools' tech crunch ====

Members of the Ubuntu California Lo``Co team and their efforts to bring Edubuntu to classrooms are highlighted in this Mecury News article.

Mike Cassidy of Mercury News reports on how Linux can help cash-strapped schools deploy computers in the school and possibly save money and administration resources alike. Many schools will have some obstacles to overcome, some schools have existing contracts or software that specifically relies on Microsoft Windows, however, Mike suggests that Linux is something that any struggling school should think about.

==== Perfectly good waste of “social” ====

Matt Asay, Canonical COO, talks about the trust that is created by the use of social media.  Matt admits, "Yes, much of social networking is just idle chitchat. But even that chitchat helps to lay the foundation for trust, which in turn is the key to fueling trade, trade which makes us rich…together."

The article points to studies that have been conducted by Nielsen and others on just how much time and money is spent (or wasted) on socializing.

Matt also points to an arguement by Matt Ridley in the Wall Street Journal as well as a blog post by Glyn Moody.

Matt says, "So don’t feel guilty when you contribute your time to open-source projects, or Facebook. You’re helping to drive global trade. See what your boss thinks of that."

==== GoogleCL Brings Google Services to the Command Line ====

Lifehacker reports on the June 18, 2010, GoogleCL announcment:

Linux/Mac/Windows: Google's new utility, Google``CL, allows you to access a handful of Google services from any *nix command line. Google's services are pretty easily accessible in their individual webapps, but if you've got a hankering for the command line, this is awesome.

Having Google's services at your fingertips in the Terminal may not sound super cool, but if you want to incorporate, say, fetching Google Calendar events, Google contacts, Google Docs, or Picasa photos into your scripts, GoogleCL is extremely handy (and long overdue). GoogleCL is a python program that can access and perform a number of actions in Blogger, Calendar, Contacts, Docs, Picasa, and You``Tube.

Ubuntu users can download a .deb package and install it right away, though Mac and Windows installation is a bit trickier.

==== 5 Things New Linux Converts Should Know ====

Jonathan De``Prizio, Techthrob.com, talks about 5 things he believes new linux users should know.  Those 5 things include:

1.  Drives don’t have letters, they have mountpoints
2.  There is no registry
3.  Software comes from the repos, not CDs or websites
4.  Don’t login as root
5.  Help is available — and it’s free!
