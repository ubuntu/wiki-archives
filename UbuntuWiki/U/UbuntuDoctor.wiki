__TOC__

Ubuntu Doctor is a GNU/Linux distribution based on Ubuntu and which integrate popular medical software. The domains can be General Medicine, Surgery, Medical imagery, etc. This distribution will also integrate widely used library for rapid software development of medical application. See Kitware, inc (ITK, VTK, KWidget) and the Inria institut.

The Window Manager has not been decided yet but I am interested in using Enlightment because of its possibility of configuration. The use of CMake as software project configuration and management is also interesting because lots of good libraries and software are already using it. It will be possible to produce portable softwares.
