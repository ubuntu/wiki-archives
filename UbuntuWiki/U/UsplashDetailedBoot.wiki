=== Summary ===
This specification outlines the method for displaying boot details without switching VTTYs and video modes.

=== Rationale ===
usplash hides valuable detailed boot output in another VTTY. It is beneficial to provide better access to that output because:

1)The method of switching between VTTYs may be unknown to portions of the user community.
2)Switching VTTYs usually leads to unappealing switching of video modes. 

=== Use Cases ===

=== Scope ===

=== Design ===

=== Implementation ===
Fedora/Red Hat's graphical boot (rhgb) provides a toggle to hide or show boot details.
Screenshots:

usplash should provide similar functionality, via a similar toggle or instructions to "Press F1 for boot details". Details should be hidden by default.
