Scale your DISTRO to the environment

*** 

      call for international collaboration
*** 

      with the positive side effect: Further defragmentation of the Linux society as cross-distribution work is needed.

The software is to blame for most of the worlds computer-garbage! How come and why? Well, this is a long story. We do aggree with the british parlament members, who notice that Vista (and maybe soon some heavy Linux-distros) send thousands of computers into garbage. This is due to careless fluffy programming, the 3D and the animation usage especially in games and – for this reasons you need to buy new computers. But for all the standard working purposes such as offices and schools this may even be disturbing for the concentration of the core output.

The optimation purpose is to combine existing distros to fit to your computer in stead of buying computers that fit to the operative system. Beside we like to minimize the environment burden in all aspects – that is the ressource consumption from the fabrication to the disintegration of COMPLETE scrapped computers.

The combined distro may end up as another distro, even we like to keep the concept inside the existing ones. But the point is: a distro that fulfill ”Linux by Demand” a userfreindly multi applicational and environmentel freindly distro with optional level of services and applications for different levels of age and speed of the computers. And all level of IT-scilled people are welcome to participate!

Background:

The fabrication of a computer account for 81% of the energy consumption of the energy usage of the entire life of the computer. So in contrast to Greenpeases effort to encorrage companies to ”Green computing” for more efficient harddisks, processors etc. companies may only help the environment of 19% conserning the DAILY energy consumption*. In few years, the daily energy-consumption will be as low as 10%**, which only make the fabrication account for a larger proportion of the energy.
Beside a new desktop computer cost about 265kg fossil oil products, 24 kg of chemicals and 1650 l of water*** and when single components are recycled 100 l of water is used.

The future in energy (and so the CO2 usage) lookes brider as we buy more laptops (59% are laptops in 2006) and laptops spend less energy. But laptop screens and flatscreens are more poluting than the old ones due to the ozone killing chemical - sulfur hexafluorid - of these monitors. Conclusively, as these environmental riscs are solved only one solution is feceable. Prolong the lifelength of each computer and here a scalable Linux is the ONLY solution today.

After the discussion of the ”Linuxdag in parlament of Dk” and intensive discussions at a conference in China at University of Yunnan (China host half of the worlds computer garbage) the needs are obvious:

To find usage of older equipment – such as thin clients for LTSP-servers, Email- and file-servers, media servers and render farming (LinuxFormat sept 2007).

To keep older computers running efficient as solitary working computers for office, schools or basic use only: A lot of partly environment freindly distributions exist such as the minimalistic distributions Deli-linux, DSL, Ubuntu-lite, Xubuntu, Ubuntueee, Knoppix etc. However, to combine these and optimize these do need some more effort and therefore we call for international collaboration.

Userfreindly minimal applications from different distributions is valuable to be picked out with care, tested and made available from a common standard repository.

The sceletton of this combined distro is

*** 

      small applications from the minimalistic distributions
*** 

      high userfreindly
*** 

      optional level of choises, dynamic add ons of services, scalable according to the equipment available (the age / processor- & RAMsize of your computer)
*** 

      long lasting security support as the Long Term Support (LTS) of Ubuntu server.
*** 

      Up to date kernel
*** 

      dynamic scalable facilities that you can adapt to your computer – such as white text on dark background

The tools:

*** 

      Few or no unnessesary services or servers are running permanent in the background (like the CUP-server) but
*** 

      Simple userfreindly and well documented text scripts available from menues in stead of GUIs.
*** 

      Energy sparing artwork (such as dark backgrounds with white text, vector-graphics in stead of bitmap graphics.) eg. to spare the life of your laptop-battery.

*** 

      Power management
*** 

      Hardware management (eg. cold storage of servers)

To do list:

*** 

      create a repository along without conflicts when choosing remote applications

*** 

      fall back recovery mode..

*** 

      test of the applications and services on different hardware
*** 

      documentation
*** 

      cross-distribution work: grab a task – 3 mounths for each miner aspect – the only salary is our fame

*** 

      characterize different applications according to slim programming and fast executing of the programs

Even the basic distribution seems to be Debian / Ubuntu a LOT of experiences are easy to convert to other distributions – that is text configurations-scripts, artwork, needed minimalistic applications and usefull for USBpens and enbedded hardware.
