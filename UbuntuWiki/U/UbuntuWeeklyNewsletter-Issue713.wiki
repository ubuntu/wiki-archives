==== Mesa's Classic Drivers Have Been Retired - Affecting ATI R100/R200 & More ====

Michael Larabel writes that the "classic OpenGL drivers (non-Gallium3D) have been cleared out of the code-base" in the "modernization" of Mesa. We are told the drivers will still be maintained in the Amber branch. We are also told the old "Radeon R100 & R200 drivers, the original Nouveau code, and the Intel i915 and i965 drivers" have been removed, resulting in "49k" lines of code removed in Mesa 22.0.

==== LibreOffice 7.2.4 and 7.1.8 Released with an Important Security Fix, Update Now ====

Marius Nestor tells us the Document Foundation has released Libre``Office 7.2.4 and Libre``Office 7.1.8, with a bugfix for CVE-2021-43527. The fixed flaw was serious enough to warrant the update for the 7.1 series that had already reached end of life, and bring the release of 7.2.4 weeks early. We are given details of this issue, links, and advised to update our systems asap.

==== Ubuntu Rethinking Its Initramfs Compression Strategy ====

Michael Larabel relays the reasoning that leads to discussions relating to changing the Zstd compression levels for various hardwares. Michael finally remarks "Finding the right mix in between for the proper memory / performance / time trade-off is still being determined but should be sorted out well in time for Ubuntu 22.04 LTS."
