Welcome to the UKTeam FAQ! The aim of this page is to provide an up to date list of common questions that we get. We encourage you to update this document when something is missing so it becomes a core source of information for the project.

== General Questions ==

=== Why don't we have a forum? ===
A forum has been avoided up until now as we didn't want to split the community into forums users and mail users. A forum to mail gateway is in the process of being setup and will then be trialed. This will mean users of http://ubuntuforums.org/ will be able to post messages to the forums which will be emailed to the mailing list, and emails to the mailing list will show up as posts on the forum.
