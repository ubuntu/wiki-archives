==== Chicago Style Release Party ====

The Ubuntu Chicago Lo``Co team held their 9.04 release party today in stormy downtown Chicago. When they arrived it was HOT and HUMID, when they left it was WET and FREEZING. They had quite a good group of people show up, and the great thing was, there were a lot of new faces. They had a lot of fun learning about the Chicago Lo``Co team, as well as what is new in the 9.04 versions of Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Xubuntu, and Ubuntu Server. Pictures at the link.

==== Rocked the Finger Lakes ====

New York: The first regional awareness and Jaunty release party was a big success. About 2 dozen people attended from: Albany, Binghamton, Ithaca, Rochester, Syracuse and other locations. Talks on "The Ubuntu Experience" and "The Direction of Ubuntu" were given, and a demo table full of computers running Jaunty Jackalope 9.04 held the interest of the attendees. OH, and don't forget the pizza! Pictures at the link.

==== Danny Piccirillo: Announcing Ubuntu Gaming Team ====

In recognition of the value of FOSS gaming, the Ubuntu Gaming Team has been formed for the mutual benefit to Ubuntu and FOSS gaming. The team is now open for anyone to join and participate in. They hope that by working towards improving FOSS gaming and development, it will help to eliminate the argument against switching to Ubuntu, into an appealing reason to switch. FOSS gaming is important to Ubuntu because a lack of quality games is one of the most cited reasons preventing users from switching to Ubuntu from Windows.

Anyone interested may join the Launchpad Team, subscribe to the mailing list, help build the team wiki, and chat in #ubuntu-gaming on irc.freenode.net!

=== In The Press ===

==== Ubuntu 9.04 as slick as Windows 7, Mac OS X ====

Renai Le``May of Cnet News says there's something that the official press release for Ubuntu 9.04 won't tell you: its designers have polished the hell out of its user interface since the last release in October. So much so, in fact, that he is starting to prefer using his Ubuntu "Jaunty Jackalope" desktop over the similarly slick Windows 7 beta and Mac OS X Leopard operating systems, which he uses regularly. Looking back to the genesis of Ubuntu 9.04 six months ago, Le``May suspects that Jaunty's subtle but powerful changes are due to the new user interface team that Ubuntu founder Mark Shuttleworth said at the time he would put in place. If so, that team has already earned its paychecks and even more, and we're looking forward to seeing what another six months of development will produce. http://news.cnet.com/8301-1001_3-10226746-92.html

==== Ubuntu 'Jaunty Jackalope' Jumps Linux Forward ====

Internet News' Sean Michael Kerner reports that Canonical's Ubuntu, known for its quirky animal named Linux releases, came out with its 9.04 release, codenamed the "Jaunty Jackalope", on Thursday. This release includes new versions for netbooks, desktops and servers and features faster boot times and cloud computing capabilities. According to Canonical CTO Matt Zimmerman: "This our 10th release and we've really come quite a long way both in demonstrating the success of a model where a business can work together with the community to produce a great product, and in the open source realm in really honing this concept of a strict time based process. It ensures we always have a fresh product on the market with all the greatest improvements that are available in free software." Ubuntu has grown from being a small Debian Linux based distribution to one of the most popular Linux distributions, with more than 8 million users. Ubuntu now challenges Red Hat and Novell in the Linux space, while also going after Microsoft and its upcoming Windows 7 release. http://www.internetnews.com/software/article.php/3816866/Ubuntu+Jaunty+Jackalope+Jumps+Linux+Forward.htm

==== Ubuntu 9.04 frankenreview ====

Tux``Radar says it's official: Ubuntu has taken over the Linux world. Tux``Radar has been using Jaunty for some time now and so far they are very impressed: it's solid as a rock, substantially faster and even has some new features. There's no doubt about it: Ubuntu 9.04 is short on killer features, but so what? This is the slow and steady, release early and often approach that has served Ubuntu well so far. When something is faster than what you had and more stable than what you had, clearly it's a lot better. But when you factor in that it also includes hundreds of new features in every conceivable part of the desktop, it becomes clear that Ubuntu 9.04 is a truly worthy update to what was already a technically impeccable Linux distribution. http://www.tuxradar.com/content/ubuntu-904-frankenreview

==== Ubuntu Users Looking a Bit Jaunty Today ====

Justin Ryan of Linux Journal says it's that time again, ladies and gents — time for the biannual release of a new Ubuntu version. This time it's the Jaunty Jackalope, officially Ubuntu 9.04, rolling off the line, and bringing with it a fresh new set of features users have been longing for. Prime among the features being touted by the Ubuntu camp are improvements in speed, perhaps rather fitting for a release named for the jackalope. Boot speed is reportedly greatly improved, as low as twenty-five seconds in some cases. Overall Ubuntu 9.04 has lived up to its promised impressiveness. All that remains is to get down to using — and, of course, to developing 9.10. http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/ubuntu-users-looking-bit-jaunty-today

==== Canonical punts Ubuntu Jaunty Jackalope ====

Timothy Prickett Morgan of Channel Register reports that on Thursday Canonical debuted its Ubuntu 9.04 release of Linux, the tenth release since the company founded the Ubuntu project in October 2004. This iteration of Ubuntu, code-named “Jaunty Jackalope,” comes with mixes designed specifically for three platforms: netbooks, desktops, and servers. Even though Ubuntu 9.04 is not a so-called Long Term Support release, Canonical founder Mark Shuttleworth has pretty high hopes for it. “It is an extraordinary release, and we expect it to be very popular,” said Shuttleworth in a conference call announcing the release. "We think it is our best release ever." http://www.channelregister.co.uk/2009/04/20/ubuntu_9_04_released/

==== Crash Testing ext4 on Ubuntu ====

One of the more controversial aspects of the Ubuntu 9.04 Jaunty Jackalope release is the use of the ext4 filesystem.  Users have apparently lost important data already while testing Ubuntu on their desktop. The advantages of ext4 are increased filesystem support for volumes up to 1 exabyte with files up to 16 terabytes, as well as increased performance. In the tests Begin``Linux.com performed, no data was lost after a number of forced crashes. The tests were done over the period of a day, and they warn that before you bet the farm on ext4 you will want to do several things. Migrate slowly to ext4 to verify for yourself that the option of performance is worth the risks.  Always use UPS and do regular backups. If you want to use ext4 on the desktop you must also follow that procedure. Last, there are applications, especially on the desktop, that really are not created for ext4 so they add additional risks. http://beginlinux.com/server_training/8-ubuntuadmin/1255-crash-testing-ext4-on-ubuntu/

=== In The Blogosphere ===

==== First Look at Ubuntu 9.04 Jaunty Jackalope ====

Lifehacker writer Keir Thomas reviews the 9.04 release of the Ubuntu desktop. Thomas covers the installation, desktop wallpaper improvements, the new notification system, Brasero CD / DVD Creator, Open``Office 3.0, and the improvements to the Synaptic package manager. Thomas sums up Ubuntu 9.04 as being "light years ahead of any other desktop version of Linux. Linux simply doesn't get any better than this right now for ordinary users, and Ubuntu is the only serious choice if you're tired of Windows or OS X". Kier Thomas is award-winning Ubuntu author of the Ubuntu Pocket Guide. http://lifehacker.com/5224586/first-look-at-ubuntu-904-jaunty-jackalope

==== Ubuntu 9.04 review ====

Tech``Combo weighs the pros and cons of the Ubuntu 9.04 release and the scales tip in favor of the pros. Ubuntu 9.04 includes the latest 2.6.28.8 kernel as well as many other features, including faster boot times, X.Org 1.6, the latest Adobe Flash, and many other pros. Noting the lack of (Windows) game support, notification controls in the preferences menu, and the lack of "new features" as the only cons in this review. " ... Ubuntu is still miles ahead of any other desktop version of Linux, and this release does have some significant server platform developments. Personally, I think Ubuntu is on the same level as Windows and OS X." http://techcombo.com/ubuntu-904-review

==== Ubuntu 9.04: Installs and Upgrades reportedly great so far ====

Rick Hodgin writes that there are "no major complaints on user forums thus far regarding either upgrades or new installs". Stating that the problems so far are with the Nvidia and ATI device drivers, relating to the 3D enhanced Compiz Fusion desktop. The open source drivers are not allowing the video drivers to recognize the high-end 3D capabilities of those cards. Hodgin lists the places new users can obtain help and assistance with Ubuntu, such as the Ubuntu``Forums.org, IRC, and online Ubuntu install guides, which as he points out can be a bit dated, but will point the user in the right direction. "With Ubuntu there really are no limitations, and most people I’ve introduced to it say Ubuntu makes using their computer fun again. After all, the word Ubuntu does means 'Humanity to others'." http://www.geek.com/articles/chips/ubuntu-904-installs-and-upgrades-reportedly-great-so-far-20090423/

==== Ubuntu Server Edition 9.04: Progress with HP ====

Joe Panettieri talked with Canonical CEO Mark Shuttleworth about the relationship between Ubuntu and Hewlett-Packard, and while it may not involve HP pre-loading Ubuntu Server on the servers yet (negotiations by Canonical for pre-loading on HP servers are in the works), the relationship currently involves compatibility testing and full certification of Proliant servers to run Ubuntu. Shuttleworth tells Works``With``U's Panettieri that Ubuntu has been tested to run on 45 different server configurations from IBM, Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard, Dell, Lenovo and other smaller providers. This is the first Canonical release to be tested on so many server systems prior to an Ubuntu upgrade launch. http://www.workswithu.com/2009/04/20/ubuntu-server-edition-904-the-coming-hp-deal/

==== Canonical Partners Launching Ubuntu Server Training ====

The VAR Guy reports that Canonical is launching Online Virtual Training for Ubuntu Server Edition in May 2009, and in conjunction with Canonical's training partners a classroom-based server course in June, this face-to-face training will be available in 12 countries. In the United States, The Var Guy Reports that the Ubuntu Training Partners ( Fast Lane and Bridge Education ) will offer this server course. The five-day course will cost (US)$2500, and costs will vary by country as the training partners set  the pricing according to the local market. Billy Cina, Canonical’s Training Programmes Manager, also told Works``With``U's The Var Guy that a "cloud course" is scheduled for a launch in mid-2009.

The current proposed line up for Canonical’s training program will include these four courses:

*** An Ubuntu desktop course, which shows end-users how to master Ubuntu for their everyday needs.
*** Ubuntu Certified Professional, which shows junior-level administrators how to set up Ubuntu (mainly desktop) in the small-to-medium office.
*** Deploying Ubuntu Server Edition, which trains administrators to deploy, configure and maintain secure Ubuntu servers.
*** Supporting Ubuntu, which helps participants to troubleshoot some common issues faced with Ubuntu

==== Shuttleworth: Oracle's Sun buy validates open source ====

According to Mark Shuttleworth, it's very hard to name a large proprietary software company which has been created since the 1990's. He argued that the major sources in software today are either free software or powered by free software, Google Yahoo etc. "The fact that Oracle has just announced a multi-billion dollar acquisition of a company that describes itself as the world's biggest Free Software and Open Source company to me is enormously instructive," Shuttleworth said. "To me it suggests that open source and free software are the big game in town. And everyone is trying to figure out what that means and how they integrate it, what they can't do is ignore it." http://blog.internetnews.com/skerner/2009/04/shuttleworth-oracles-sun-buy-v.html
