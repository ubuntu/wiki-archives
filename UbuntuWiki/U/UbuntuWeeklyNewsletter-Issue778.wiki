=== The Hub ===

==== What’s up with Ubuntu mainline builds? ====

Canonical employee juergh asks if we noticed any of the Ubuntu mainline kernel builds failing, before outlining what changes have occurred. We are briefly told changes to how kernel config changes are handled caused a number of mainline builds to break, and some of the checks that are performed to ensure there are no broken kernels. We are told stable kernel builds should now reoccur, and reminded that mainline kernel builds are not actively monitored, so if problems are detected you can report via IRC or on mailing list.

==== Kubuntu Manual 22.04.2 Release ====

The Kubuntu team announces the release of the Kubuntu 22.04.2 Manual, offering thanks to those who provided feedback and filed bug reports.

https://kubuntu.org/news/kubuntu-manual-22-04-2-release/

==== Authenticated encryption: why you need it and how it works ====

Andrea Corbellini discusses "malleability" in relation to a "common problem of modern cryptographic ciphers". In this long, and somewhat complex post, we are walked through some components of ciphers, some basic problems which help introduce us to the 'malleability' issue that this article is about. Numerous examples are given, including some pictures, and code, that help us recognize issues.
