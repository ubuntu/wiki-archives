=== Description ===
The Unanswered Posts Team is a forum team designed to reduce the number of topics on the forums with zero replies.

The team goal is to try to answer as many unanswered posts on the forums as possible. The less empty topics there are, the better. We don't want users to go away from the forums thinking that no one cares about their topic or problem.
