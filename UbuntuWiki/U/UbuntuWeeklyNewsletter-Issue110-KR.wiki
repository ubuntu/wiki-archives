Potential hardware-damaging e1000e driver: Intrepid
잠재적 하드웨어-손상 e1000e 드라이버: 인트리피드

Reports have been coming in that the e1000e ethernet driver for Intel GigE chipsets, as included upstream in Linux 2.6.27, may under certain conditions irreparably damage your ethernet hardware by corrupting the on-board firmware. Alpha releases are expected to have a fair number of bugs, but bugs that damage hardware is another matter. As a result of this bug we must recommend that users do *not* use Intrepid alphas, including the LiveCDs, on machines with Intel GigE ethernet.

인텔 GigE 칩셋 용 e1000e 이더넷 드라이버가 리눅스 2.6.27 업스트림을 포함하여 특정한 상황에서 여러분의 이더넷 하드웨어에 손상을 일으킬 수 있다는 내용의 보고서가 들어왔습니다. 알파 배포는 상당한 분량의 버그를 가지고 있음이 예상되지만 하드웨어에 손상을 일으킨다는 것은 별개의 문제입니다. 이 버그의 결과로서 우리는 사용자들에게 인텔 GigE 이더넷이 사용되는 기기에 라이브CD를 포함한 인트리피드 알파를 사용하지 말아주실 것을 당부드립니다.

Efforts to safeguard the hardware of affected users are ongoing, though initially this will consist of a workaround in the form of disabling the e1000e driver. Alpha 6 CD images will not be re-issued for this fix, so affected users are advised to either use daily CD images once a resolution is in place, or to wait for the release of the 8.10 beta, due to be released on October 2nd. Further discussion of this issue can be found on the ubuntu-devel mailing list at: https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ub...er/026559.html, and progress on resolving this issue can be tracked at: https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/263555.

Ubuntu 8.10 beta approaching
우분투 8.10 베타 어프로칭

Ubuntu 8.10, Intrepid Ibex Beta is scheduled to be released Thursday, October 2nd, 2008. There are milestone bug items remaining[1] that need to be cleaned up. There are also bugs that affect the release as a whole.[2] It is also important to address inconsistencies in archiving, such as uninstallable packages in main and restricted[3] and undeclared Replaces or Conflicts.[4]

우분투 8.10, 인트리피드 아이벡스 베타가 2008년 10월 둘째주 목요일 배포될 예정입니다. 처리되어야할 마일스톤 버그 아이템들이 남아있습니다. 또한 전체로서 배포판에 영향을 미칠 수 있는 버그들도 있습니다. 메인이나 제한된 영역에서 인스톨 가능하지 않은 패키지들과 선언되지 않은 교체나 충돌 등과 같은 것들을 목록화하는 데 있어 불규칙성을 보고하는 것 역시 중요합니다.

Ubuntu 7.04 reaches end-of-life on October 19, 2008

Ubuntu announced the release of 7.04 almost 18 months ago, on April 19th, 2007. As with the earlier releases, Ubuntu committed to ongoing security and critical fixes for a period of 18 months. The support period for 7.04 is now nearing its end-of-life date. On Sunday, October 19th, 2008, Ubuntu security notices will no longer include information, or updated packages for Ubuntu 7.04. The supported upgrade path is to version 7.10. Those wishing to upgrade to 8.04 must first upgrade to 7.10, then again to 8.04. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GutsyUpgrades.

Intrepid Release Parties!
인트리피드 배포 파티!

Ubuntu will be 4 years old with the release of Intrepid Ibex. What better time to throw a party than to combine the release with a birthday bash? Organizing a party is pretty simple:
우분투가 인트리피드 아이벡스 배포와 함께 네 살이됩니다. 배포와 함께 생일 잔치를 하기에 딱 좋은 때 아닌가요? 파티 구성은 아주 단순합니다:

Pick a date: It is recommended that it be either Thursday, October 30th, or the following weekend, Nov. 1st or 2nd.

 
Pick a venue: This can be someone’s back yard, a pub, a university room, a school, etc. The key thing is not the venue, it is the people. 
Add your party to the list: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/IntrepidReleaseParties 
Let the world know: Blog about it, make up some fliers, and put them in computers shops, libraries, cafes, educational establishments, etc. 

A more detailed guide to organizing a release party can be found at: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BuildingComm...ngReleaseParty. Be sure to include your release party on the master list at: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/IntrepidReleaseParties. The important thing is to get organized, have fun, and help make the release of Intrepid Ibex a success in your community.
