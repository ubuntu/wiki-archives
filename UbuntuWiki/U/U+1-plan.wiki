__TOC__

== Team responsibilities ==
The U+1 Team will engage into activities related exclusively to the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UsingDevelopmentReleases|Development Releases]]</nowiki> of Ubuntu. Such activities may include:<<BR>>
* Intra-day updates testing and reporting;
* Custom Testing (e.g. CheckPoint, <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UsingDevelopmentReleases#Using%20TestDrive|TestDrive]]</nowiki>, as well as answering to direct requests from developers);
* Creating high value-added Launchpad Bug Reports and working with triagers and developers to solve such bugs, if requested;
* Supporting new Development Release users;
* Attracting new talents to the team, retaining and motivating skilled testers;
* Developing, documenting and sharing testing procedures and techniques;
* Documenting its organizational and technical information and making it publicly accessible via Ubuntu Wiki;
* Supporting other teams in activities that relate to the Development Releases (QA, learning, documentation, etc).<<BR>>
U+1 members will sign and follow the <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/project/aboutubuntu/conduct|Code of Conduct]]</nowiki>, being respectful and responsible in all of its Ubuntu-related activities.
== Team governance ==
The U+1 Team is self-managed, meaning its members define the team goals, plan and regular activities. Members get a chance to propose changes and have their ideas voted by the others. Conflicts are handled internally and, only in punctual situations, taken to the Community Council (by the team leader).
== Team membership ==
Any Ubuntu user may apply for a 1-year U+1 Team Membership. In order to do so, the user must:
* Sign Ubuntu Code of Conduct and act according to it;
* Provide valuable contributions to the team activities and discussions;
* Engage productively into the team activities;
* Be accepted by other members in a U+1 Team Meeting. Current members that attend to the meeting will vote for or against the membership application.<<BR>>
Observations:
* U+1 activities require some degree of technical knowledge. Team memberships will not be granted to users that don't actively contribute to the team activities and/or that have no technical skills to assume a role in the team;
* The U+1 Team is subject to the Community Council governance. It can not offer <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership|Ubuntu Memberships]]</nowiki> to it's members.
== Recognition memberships ==
Team memberships will immediately be granted to all the Ubuntu+1 regulars that have clearly contributed to its development and provided support to Development Releases users. As with many Ubuntu Team Memberships, its length term is of one year (this is preset in the team settings in Launchpad as a way of tracking active members). Members automatically receive renewal requests via mail when their membership is about to expire.
== Ubuntu Membership ==
U+1 Team Memberships are not the same as <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership|Ubuntu Memberships]]</nowiki>. Every Ubuntu user can apply for an Ubuntu Membership by following the procedures described <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership|here]]</nowiki>.
== Team Founder / Ownership ==
* The team founder <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~Effenberg0x0|Effenberg0x0]]</nowiki> is automatically granted "ownership" of it in Launchpad.
* The Team Founder will create a Team Council and transfer ownership of the U+1 Team to the U+1 Team Council.
* The Team founder, who would then be the Team Council founder, will occupy a permanent position in the council. Therefore all of his decisions will have to be voted by other council members, to prevent any possibility of dictatorial ownership of the team.
== Leadership ==
* U+1 will be led by one of its members for the period of '''one complete development cycle''';
* The current leader will communicate all members the start of new elections up to two (2) weeks before the end of the current development cycle. This will be posted in the team Mailing List;
* Team members will immediately be notified through the mailing list of the candidates for election to team leader.
* Applications must be informed, by Mailing List, up to three days after the public announcement of elections;
* Applicants for the team leadership will provide links to:
** A Launchpad page (to check if the Ubuntu CoC was signed)

* A voting session via '''U+1 IRC Channel''' will be held up to one (1) week before the beginning of the new development cycle;
* The selected member will assume the leadership position immediately on day one of the new development cycle;
* Once elected, the team leader must communicate to all members the start of new elections for '''two (2) new council positions''', except for the QQ cycle, in which three '''(3) to four (4)''' new council positions will be created;
* Previous team leaders will automatically assume the position of Team Council members for the term length of two (2) development cycles, the same term length of other members of the council, except for the team founder (permanent position);
* Previous team leaders are allowed to run for re-election;

* All team leaders are expected to have read and accepted the Ubuntu Code of Conduct, as well as the <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/community/leadership-conduct|Leadership Code of Conduct]]</nowiki>.
=== Current (PP) Leadership ===
* For the remaining days of the Precise Pangolin development cycle, team leadership will be held by <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~cariboo907|Cariboo907]]</nowiki>.

== Decision Making Processes ==
Decisions of minor importance, which adhere to the team goals and processes and do not require a change in its plan might (and likely will) be taken by the team leader and/or the council with no participation of its members. At this initial phases of the U+1 Team, members are expected to help its development, engaging more in its productive activities than in its internal management. However, some other decisions may affect the group and its members. In these cases, the propositions will be presented to all members via mailing list and a meeting (IRC) will be scheduled. All members present at the session will vote on the subject.
== Delegation ==
Team members are expected to volunteer to its activities. Delegation will happen in an open and non-mandatory form during team meetings or via the team mailing list.
== Dispute Resolution ==
All U+1 Team members are expected to have signed and to operate according to the Ubuntu Code of Conduct. Conflict should be avoided and, when not possible, rapidly managed by the Team Council, in a way that it does not interfere with the team work.
* The Team Council will designate one member to manage the conflict;
* This member will speak with each party involved in the situation and gather the relevant details;
* A private session of the Team Council will be scheduled to evaluate the information collected;
* The team council will come up with a solution and vote on it;
* The  council has the authority to remove members from the Team, if needed;
* <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BuildingCommunity/DealingWithConflict|General guidelines]]</nowiki> proposed by the Ubuntu Community Council will be considered;
* If necessary, conflicts will be taken to the Community Council.
== Team and Members Evaluation ==
* The team council is responsible for evaluating its members and, eventually, supporting their Ubuntu membership request for the Community Council or other boards of governance;
* In such cases, the team council will provide the governance board with precise and true information about the members' contributions and performance, as requested.
== Team Technical Resources ==
=== Launchpad ===
The U+1 Team is registered at https://launchpad.net/~U+1. This page lists general information about the team and it's members.
=== Mailing-List ===
The U+1 Team Mailing-List is hosted at U+1@lists.launchpad.net. It is used exclusively for U+1 member discussions and also for interaction with other teams and developers. It's not targeted at end-user support. It is a moderated list and it requires subscription (see https://launchpad.net/~U+1).
=== Forum ===
The Ubuntu+1 sub-forum at UbuntuForums.org is the main channel for end-user support. Using the forum for support has some advantages, as it creates a searchable knowledge base, that can be accessed by other users (unlike IRC). However, the sub-forum is not managed by the U+1 Team, but by the Forum Council. All issues regarding the forum must be addressed to the forum staff and the focum council.
=== IRC Channel ===
U+1 uses an IRC channel for it's internal management, discussions and events.<<BR>>
There's currently not enough resources to use the IRC channel for end-user support. The Ubuntu+1 sub-forum at UbuntuForums.org is the main end-user support media.
The channel is registered and moderated, and hosted at irc.ubuntu.com at #U+1.
=== Wiki ===
The wiki is hosted at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/U+1. Notice the uppercase letter 'U'.
== Team Reports ==
* It is important to track the team developments and activities;
* The team council will be responsible for keeping track of such information and reporting it;
* All team reports should be public and also directly provided to the Community Council.
=== Media ===
* Reports will be posted to the team <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/U+1/reports|reports]]</nowiki> wiki page;
* The information will also be posted to the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommunityCouncil/TeamReports|Community Council Reporting Page]]</nowiki>;
* Additionally, the Team Council will participate in IRC meetings to report its work and the activities of its members to the Community Council and other governance boards;
=== Regularity ===
* Team reports will be monthly updated;
* The team council is responsible for delegating this task and verifying that it is being done properly.
== International / Localized Content and Team Branches ==
* U+1 is a new team with limited human resources and experimental processes. It would be hard to spread its ideas to international groups (and to manage them).
* English is the common language of the U+1 team. Although many of its members speak other languages translation is not one of the aims of the U+1 testing team. This is to avoid diluting the team's efforts in its primary purpose of testing Ubuntu software. For the same reason there is no intention to translate the U+1 Testers wiki.
