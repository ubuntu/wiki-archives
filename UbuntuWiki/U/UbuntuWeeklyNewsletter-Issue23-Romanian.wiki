==== Lansarea mEDUXa ====

Departamentul de educaţie, cultură şi sport al guvernului regional din insulele spaniole Canare au lansat mEDUXa 1.0. mEDUXa este o distribuţie de software liber GNU/Linux dezvoltată în scop educaţional şi este bazată pe Kubuntu. Va rula pe 35000 de calculatoare în 1100 de şcoli, fapt ce reprezintă un potenţial de 325000 de utilizatori (25000 de profesori şi 300000 de studenţi) în şcolile de stat ale Insulelor Canare. mEDUXa vine configurat cu profiluri diferite, datorită modului KDE Kiosk. Una din caracteristicile majore ale mEDUXa este profilul pentru cei mai mici elevi (între 4 şi 8 ani).

==== Jono Bacon intervievat de BehindUbunutu ====

If you haven't been keeping up with the BehindUbuntu interviews, now is as a good time as ever! Florida, Sausage Dogs and bash.org! Open your mouth wide in shock as he slips in a full two sentences pimping Jokosher! Get it all in the BehindUbuntu’s revealing interview with our very own man of metal, Jono Bacon. http://behindubuntu.org/interviews/JonoBacon/

==== Free Geek Burgled ====

Free Geek este o fundaţie non-profit care recicleaza componente de calculator şi alte echipamente informatice vechi şi le distribuie celor neprivilegiaţi, şcolilor şi organizaţiilor non-profit în schimbul unor servicii prestate în folosul comunităţii. Ubuntu este instalat pe toate calculatoarele astfel distribuite.

Din păcate, organizaţia Free Geek a fost recent victima unei spargeri. Valoarea bunurilot furate a fost estimate la aproximativ 4500 de dolari americani. Numeroase persoane şi organizaţii non-profit simt deja efectul acestui act, în special sistemul local de şcoli. Pentru mai multe informaţii legate de incident şi cum puteţi da o mână de ajutor, vizitaţi http://www.freegeek.org/news.php#breakin, de asemenea http://fridge.ubuntu.com/node/648 şi http://www.katu.com/news/4688221.html .

==== Ubuntu 6.06.2? ====

A common question has been ''Are there any plans to release Ubuntu 6.06.2? If so, when?'' and we've finally gotten an answer. Colin Watson, an Ubuntu developer and Canonical Employee, announced on the Ubuntu-devel mailing list that there is no current plans for Ubuntu 6.06.2:
"I expect we'll do another point release at *some* point just to aggregate updates, but there's no schedule at the moment, and other things are higher-priority"
You can read Watson's entire message at https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2006-November/022542.html

None the less, there were some interesting and exciting changes that still landed. This week we also have a new method of showcasing the changes in Feisty.

=== In The Press ===

==== Kurdish Ubuntu in Turkey ====

Kurdish Ubuntu has been promoted (http://www.ntvmsnbc.com/news/391178.as link in Turkish) in Diyarbakir, Turkey, with a reception. According to the news agency, Ubuntu was the first linux distribution to implement Kurdish localization. Kurdish localization in Linux is an important milestone for Turkey due to ethnic conflicts (You can read more at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurds_in_turkey ). 

Kurdish Ubuntu was prepared by a team of hardworking translators (https://launchpad.net/people/kurdish ) in Rosetta. In his talk at the reception, the mayor of Sur (a town in Diyarbakir) said that "Whatever language it is in, we wanted it "our service" to be accessible multi-lingually because multilingualism is our wealth. Our work is being conducted on Kurdish, English, and Turkish language support. ... If we can integrate multilingualism, multi-identities, and multi-culturalism in this nation, this region will be a place of peace instead of conflicts." 

Mehmed Uzun, a Kurdish writer, speaking about the Kurdish language, told the attendees that "Our most important problem is that the language is not standardized. The Kurdish language should be standardized." Ubuntu was later distributed to the reception's attendees. You can find screenshots of the Kurdish Ubuntu at http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Kurdish_Linux_launched_in_Turkey

==== Ubuntu in the OLPC mix: An Interview at ZDNet ====

MIT Media Lab guru Nicholas Negroponte has been grabbing the headlines recently with his One Laptop Per Child project. The aim is to create a cheap — about $100 — and robust laptop for use in the developing world. Negroponte is adamant that ownership of the device is key to helping children engage with technology. However, the OLPC project is not the only organisation to have focused on the lack of computing devices and infrastructure in the developing world. 

An alternative to both the refurbished PCs and the OLPC approach has been developed by two UK academics. Ndiyo, the Swahili word for "yes", is a project that aims to allow multiple users access to the same PC. The brain-child of Quentin Stafford-Fraser, a former research scientist at AT&T Laboratories Cambridge, Ndiyo is based around the untapped ability of the Linux operating system (Ubuntu) to support numerous simultaneous users.

=== Meetings ===

==== Xubuntu Community Meeting ====

Xubuntu had a very important meeting (the first meeting in almost 6 months, you can read the agenda at https://wiki.ubuntu.org/Xubuntu/Meetings/Archive/Agenda/2006-11-25) on November 25th which was open to the general community. After 2 and a half hours of discussion, it appears that the Xubuntu Team (http://launchpad.net/people/xubuntu-team ) and interested community members have made great strides in developing goals, strategies, and organization for the Feisty release cycle. Topics included artwork, documentation efforts, website development, community development, and much more. You can review the minutes from the meeting at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xubuntu/Meetings/Archive/Minutes/2006-11-25 and the log at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MeetingLogs/Xubuntu_2006-11-25.

==== Ubuntu Documentation Team Meeting ====

The Ubuntu Documentation Team was also guilty of taking a long meeting hiatus but that changed on November 24th when the doc team got together to discuss documentation specifications, the kubuntu desktop guide, Ubuntu open week, the use of screencasts, Xubuntu documentation (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xubuntu/Documentation) and consider a move from svn to bzr. You can find a detailed summary at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DocumentationTeamMeeting20061124.

=== Upcoming Events ===

In just two years, Ubuntu has become one of the most popular Linux distribution in the world with millions of users and a spot regularly at the top of Distrowatch. Ever wondered what all the fuss is about? How we've achieved such a great feat in such a short space of time? With the upcoming Ubuntu Open Week, you can do just that!

The Ubuntu community and Ubuntu's corporate sponsor Canonical is holding a series of online workshops where you can:

*** learn about the Ubuntu landscape;
*** talk to some of the key developers from the Ubuntu project;
*** find out about the Community and its relationship with Canonical;
*** participate in an open Q&A with Mark Shuttleworth, the founder of Ubuntu; and
*** much more...

The week takes place between '''Mon 27th Nov and Sat 2nd Dec 2006''' and more information about the event (including a schedule of the week's events) can be found at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuOpenWeek.
 
=== Specification spotlight ===

Last week we added a new feature called "Specification highlight" and we discussed the very interesting Network Roaming (https://features.launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+spec/network-roaming) and Default Network Services (https://features.launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+spec/default-network-services) specification. This week will continue with the network theme and take a look at the much desired Winmodem Support (https://blueprints.launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+spec/winmodem-support) specification which proposes developing out-of-the-box support for winmodems.

As you may know, a winmodem is a software modem designed to work with the Microsoft Windows operating system. A traditional modem uses hardware to perform its tasks, but Winmodems perform their key tasks with software. This makes them smaller and cheaper to produce, but it also means they cannot be easily used on other operating systems because the driver support requires far more effort to produce. This specification proposes including drivers for supported winmodems by default andr working with the upstream project (http://linmodems.org) to develop drivers for winmodems that are currently unsupported.

With over 500 individuals strongly supporting this specification (out of 771 respondents) according to an unofficial poll (http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=82608) conducted on the ubuntu forums (http://ubuntuforums.org), it seems like support for winmodems could have a positive impact on the ubuntu experience for a lot of users.

=== Ubuntu Weekly Newsletter Correction ===

The UWN Team would like to correct an error in the Ubuntu Weekly Newsletter Issue # 21.

Colin Watson wrote"
"

Quoting from https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-news/2006-November/000061.html:

"However, only certain people have the authoirty[sic] to determine which specs are worthy of discussion at a meeting like the Ubuntu DeveloperSummit in Mountain View, and fewer still can approve a spec for official inclusion in Ubuntu."

Actually, this is backwards. Approving specs for meetings is done by the Technical Board (four people at present), while we have been farming the job of approver out to increasing numbers of longer-serving core developers. We had a conference call shortly before the summit with IIRC at least six of us going through the list and figuring out which of us would be best suited to make sure each discussion was going in a sensible direction.

Cheers,

Colin Watson
"

The UWN Team would like to apologize for any confusion that this error may have caused and much thanks to Colin Watson for letting us know.
