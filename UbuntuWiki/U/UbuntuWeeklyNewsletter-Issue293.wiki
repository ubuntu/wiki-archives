==== CoC Version 2.0 has been released ====

Charles Profitt of the Ubuntu Community Council announces the new version of Ubuntu’s Code of Conduct, an “important guiding document which forms the basis how organization operates internally and externally.”

A summary of changes included in this revision of the Code of Conduct is as follows:

* merged CoC and LCoC, factored in diversity statement too
* generalised it, so other communities can more easily make use of it
* mention CC-BY-SA 3.0 license
* generally reduced duplication
* make it clear that everybody can take action, there's no need to wait for formal recognition
* explain governance principles
* concrete leadership guidelines: added paragraphs about courage, considerateness and decisiveness

The Code of Conduct is available at the following address:  https://launchpad.net/codeofconduct/2.0

==== New community-announce mailing list! ====

There are all kinds of announcements in the Ubuntu community posted on the Ubuntu Fridge that are not strictly development or release-related - from the recent revision of the Code of Conduct, to upcoming community-wide events.

At the Ubuntu Developer Summit in October, the Community Council spoke with other members of the community and decided to launch a new community announcement mailing list so community members can receive these announcements by email as well.

The list is now live! Sign up here: https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/community-announce

==== Review: Ubuntu 12.10 Quantal Quetzal a mix of promise, pain ====

Brian Proffitt of Ars Technica brings us a detailed review of the Ubuntu 12.10 Quantal Quetzal installation process, along with issues he encountered during the installation. The article explores the “shiny” features, including improvements to the dash and newer application versions, the imperfection of online account linking and integration, and a quick note about how to uninstall the shopping lens. Profitt also notes he has “personally never been the world's biggest fan of Ubuntu's Unity interface” but that Unity has “improvements since it was first released. Beyond the pretty interface, there's a sense of real depth to this interface now, as pieces and parts fit together in ways that make sense.” In spite of these improvements, he also notes it’s slower on older machines without the 2d version and offers suggestions on how to install alternative desktops. The article wraps up with a quick look at Open``Stack and juju.

==== Proprietary Software for Ubuntu--What Will It Mean? ====

Matt Hartley shares with us an introspective view on a potential divide between Ubuntu and other Linux distros. He highlights the absense of marketing attention when compared to Ubuntu. Ubuntu's market attention looks appealing to both new users and to companies like Valve, who are now offering proprietary software for Ubuntu.
