We are given the backgrounds of the guests, and told this Indaba will look at educators who are using "Ubuntu as a teaching tool". We are reminded the Indaba is streamed to Youtube and twitch, with this thread suitable for questions if you can't make the live stream.

=== In the Blogosphere ===

==== Updated: Xubuntu 23.04 Will Offer Official ‘Minimal’ Image ====

Joey Sneddon updates a post first published last week (see UWN issue 770) with a correction that the text-based installer will not be used, nor will an active internet connection be required.

https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2023/01/xubuntu-23-04-will-come-in-a-cd-rom-size-minimal-image

==== First Look: Ubuntu’s New Installer is Shaping Up Nicely ====

Joey Sneddon writes about the new Ubuntu Desktop installer. He notes that it uses a different toolkit (Flutter) & "leverages Ubuntu's server-based Subiquity and Curtin efforts", but still doesn't look "that different to the existing" installer. Joey reminds us the installer was available on prior releases via a 'canary' ISO, then walks through an install, providing many screenshots of an installation process, along with brief commentary.

==== KDE Plasma 5.27 Beta Released With Tiling & Multi-Monitor Improvements ====

==== gnome-info-collect: What we learned ====

Allan Day reminds us of the 'research exercise' that ran using the 'gnome-info-collect' tool, which got a "fantastic response" with over 2500 people uploading their data. This post shares what was learnt from those responses. Firstly the users who likely responded and thus have provided their data is outlined noting this may influence the results. The data is presented in various subjects, provided in numerous tables - with descriptions, and is rather detailed in this long report. Finally Vojtěch Staněk is thanked for his work on the gnome-info-collect tool, with a note that the final data will not be published in complete form (for privacy reasons).
