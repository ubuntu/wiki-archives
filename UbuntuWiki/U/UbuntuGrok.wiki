This page will document a few Grok projects that we are working on and how to set them up on Ubuntu.

Here is what we have so far:

We will be installing Grok and all the supporting Python software in what is called a '''virtual environment'''.  There are two good reasons for doing this:

## It is easiest, in the sense that the changes you will make to your system will be localized and will neither effect nor be effected by any other Python environment you have on your system.
## It is safest, for the same reason.

Once we have a real application we want to deploy, it will be time to leave the ease and safety of our virtual environment behind us, but for now, since we are just learning, we will remain in the warmth and comfort that our virtual environment creates.

Before you can create a virtual environment, run the following two commands from a Unix prompt:

** <code>sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev python-setuptools subversion bzr</code>
** <code>sudo easy_install virtualenv</code>
