== Ideas for Unity Lenses ==

Unity Lenses are a cool new Unity technology that allow you to make mash ups of elements that integrate with the Dash and Launcher. An example of a Lens is Seif's <nowiki>[[http://seilo.geekyogre.com/2010/11/unity-Lens-people-day-2/|People Lens]]</nowiki>:

<nowiki>[[File:peopleplace.png]]</nowiki>

In short, a Lens is something a user will access from either search or via a dedicated button on their launcher. It also provides a ''consistent'' way for users to search and browse this data.

=== Kinds of Lenses ===

Dash is very constrained to do text and facet searching. It's not for browsing photos, or browsing music or anything like that. Dash things are search results - a search box at the top, with search results, with headers, and search filters, and that's it. We are purposely not supporting fancy widgets or anything like that - a Lens is there to return data that people care about.

So while you wouldn't browse your photos in a lens, you would expect it to return a list of thumbnails when you search for "2011 Vacation", and then take you to the photo application. 

==== Application Lenses ====

Application Lenses integrate with your system and applications. There are currently three application Lenses.

* Applications - this is basically your application launcher, search for the app you want and launch
* Files - this is a quick way to find a file via a dash search.
* People - this is a quick way to find a person via a dash search.

For Natty these are all the application Lenses we're working on, we'd like people to concentrate on Web Lenses, since the opportunity to do cool things there is greater:

==== Web Lenses ====

Web Lenses integrate your system with the web. The idea here is hit the super key, search, and then have it return results from whatever website you care about. A good analogy would be that they are like <nowiki>[[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/search-tools/|Firefox Search Providers]]</nowiki>, except they are for your entire system, not just your browser, and since they talk Zeitgeist we can manipulate that data and do cool t hings with them.

==== Default Dash Lens ====

Users should be able to configure which lens they would like to display as the default for the Dash window. Users should also be able to somehow identify an arbitrary number of individual lenses in order to choose their own key bindings for an arbitrary number of lenses, besides the key binding for the main Dash window (typically the left Super key).

This is particularly important in any scenario where the Dash becomes full of enough features to eliminate the launchers launcher (a logical outcome), especially for as long as the Big Funny Button is not restorable to the top Unity panel.

==== Lens Cycling ====

In addition to the lenses being identifiable via icons at the bottom of the Dash window, users are able to hit Tab to cycle through the lenses (or Shift Tab to cycle backwards).

----

=== Proposals For Specific Lenses ===

Here are some examples of ideas for some Lenses. We need '''your help''' to come up with ideas AND to help implement them. Make sure to refer to the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Unity/Lenses|Unity Lenses Documentation]]</nowiki> if you want to write one of these and to familiarize yourself with the terminology.

* Note, these are just ideas, think of crazy things and add them! 
* Each idea should explain what goes where in the actual Lens, refer to this diagram:

<nowiki>[[File:unity-glossary.png]]</nowiki>

=== Core Lenses ===

These are closer to low level functionality of a graphical shell.

==== Window Management ====

| Name

|-
| Open Windows Lens
| Allows you to view all open windows and search them by window title. Shows the window icon and title. Alternatively show the window title and a window preview similar to the window preview in Windows 7, DockbarX, and the Talika window-switcher applet for the Gnome2 panel. (Icon versus window preview could be user configurable similar to the same choice in Nautilus.) When an icon/preview is clicked, switch to that window. Main groups or sections for this lens would consist of "This Workspace" and "All Workspaces". In the search bar the user could also filter based on the application name if necessary. The default key binding for this lens could perhaps be the right Super key, although it should be user configurable as well. The addition of this lens would make the dock / springboard / launcher launcher redundant and unnecessary.

==== Pinned Applications ====

| Pinned Apps Lens
| Allows user to pin apps of their own choice to an area in the Dash, as an alternative to using the launcher (dock) and making the launcher redundant. Precedents for this include the Windows Start menu, the Linux Mint menu, and the Cardapio menu available for Ubuntu through a PPA. The intent of this lens is NOT to replace the "Frequently" used apps statistics in the main Dash window (as determined, presumably, by Zeitgeist), but to supplement what the system thinks with what the user explicitly chooses. However, it might also be nice to give users the option of turning off the "Frequently Used" statistics, or blacklisting individual items (or categories of items, e.g., apps or folders) from the statistics collection.
