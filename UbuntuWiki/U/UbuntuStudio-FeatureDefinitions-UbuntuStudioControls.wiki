On systems that support it, there will be a menu in the app-indicator area:

== Features ==

Complete list of planned features. See further down the page for a more complete explanation.

System Info:
* Full system check script - make sure everything is in order
* Monitor system resources, such as DSP, CPU, Memory, Temp, CPU Hz

System Settings:
* System setup wizard:
** Analyze system:
** if ok, show rt configuration toggle
** if not ok, ask to clean the system, and set default rt configuration
** Make Settings for each audio server (pulseaudio, jack) (alsa???)
** Jack Specific Settings:
*** Select jack (jackd1, jackd2, jackdmp)
*** Select and test default audio device (button to a alsa mixer for that card, for setting levels)
*** Enable/disable autostart at login
*** Enable/disable alsa to jack midi bridge
** Pulseaudio Specific Settings:
*** Select and test default audio device (button to a pulseaudio mixer, for setting levels
*** Enable/disable autostart at login
** Enable/disable pulseaudio to jack bridge (greyed out when using jack1, perhaps even jack2)
** Select default kernel
** Select default CPU governor
** Set Swappiness
** Perform a system test, and ask if to send it <somewhere> (anonymous info only)
* Realtime Administration (per user control: audio group and security/limits file)
* swappiness
* CPU governor

Third Party Application Settings:
* jack
** set device I/O (hw:<name>, preferably also by pci number)
** samplerate
** latency (simple and advanced control)
** take snapshot of connections
* pulseaudio
** set device I/O
** volume control
* a2jmidi
* zita-a2j

Third Party Application Launchers:
* pulseaudio (desktop audio) mixer
* card alsa/ffado mixer (correct mixer is launched, based on running audio device)
* patchage, for making jack connections

Session Settings:
* Profiles/Modes (each profile can have different session settings)
** autostart jack y/n
** autostart a2jmidid y/n
** autostart pulseaudio y/n
** autostart pulse-to-jack-bridge y/n
** auto-set jack as input y/n
** auto-set jack as output y/n
** default CPU governor mode

Quick buttons:
* (Desktop audio volume - pulseaudio)
* Profile/Mode - Low Latency(monitoring), High Latency(mixing), Power Saving(desktop usage)
* Reset (resets everything, and possibly restarts all audio servers)

=== System Info ===

==== System Check Script ====

'''Abstract:''' A system script for making sure there are no problems in the system. Great for troubleshooting.

'''Actions:'''
* autorun at login (silently in the background)
* print full report in home folder
* check: kernel type
* check: irq conflicts
* check: (etc..)

'''Graphical IF:'''
* toggle for notifying of errors/problems at login
* button for manual check

==== Monitor System Resources ====

'''Abstract:'''

'''Actions:'''

'''Graphical IF:'''

=== System Settings ===

==== Realtime Administration ====

'''Abstract:'''

'''Actions:'''
* list only "real" users
* add selected user to correct group
* make sure correct group has rtprio and memlock privileges
* check the kernel if rtprio and memlock are the same as settings
** if there is no rtprio or memlock at all, ask the user to reboot for changes to have effect
** if there are conflicting values, advice the user that there is a conflicting settings file in /etc/security/

'''Graphical IF:'''

Select user from a menu, and toggle rt privilege for that user.

==== Swappiness ====

''This setting requires root privilege, and a reboot for changes to have effect''

'''Abstract:''' The default Ubuntu setting is no good for desktop/multimedia production use. 10 is a good value. But, the user could be allowed to change it to something else too. What are good values here, and what are min-max values? 

'''Actions:'''
* Set a new value for swappiness in a custom file at /etc/sysctl.d/*

'''Graphical IF:'''
* Slider to set swappiness from 0-?

==== CPU governor ====

'''Abstract:''' In order to change the cpu governor on the fly, we'll need access to do so.

'''Actions:'''
* ?

'''Graphical IF:'''
* Display available governors as radio buttons.

=== Third Party Application Control ===

The makeup of Linux Audio requires the use of several different applications/servers. Ubuntu Studio Controls will try to simplify setting those up, by including controls for the most useful ones.

==== Jack ====

'''Abstract:'''

'''Actions:'''
* autostart option
* set audio device (persistent between boots)
* set samplerate
* set latency (two settings)
* make snapshot of connections
* Choose between jackd and jackdbus (and show info on what is installed)

'''Graphical IF:'''

==== Pulseaudio ====

'''Abstract:'''

'''Actions:'''
* autostart option
* set audio I/O (jack should be persistent)
* pulse to jack bridge enable/disable

'''Graphical IF:'''

==== a2jmidid ====

'''Abstract:'''

'''Actions:'''
* autorun when jack starts option

'''Graphical IF:'''

==== zita-a2j ====

'''Abstract:'''

'''Actions:'''

'''Graphical IF:'''

=== Third Party Application Launchers ===

As there already are lots of good guis for different functions, we can make use of those as a part of the Ubuntu Studio Controls solution for controlling and setting up audio.

==== pavucontrol ====

'''Abstract:'''

'''Actions:'''

'''Graphical IF:'''

==== card mixer ====

'''Abstract:''' Some cards have special mixers, such as firewire devices, and some pci cards.

'''Actions:'''
* launch appropriate mixer for card in use

'''Graphical IF'''

==== patchage ====

'''Abstract:'''

'''Actions:'''

'''Graphical IF:'''

=== Session Settings ===
