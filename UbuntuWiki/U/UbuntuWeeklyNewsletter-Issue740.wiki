==== Stable Updates Back To Linux 4.9 Released For Intel MMIO Stale Data Vulnerabilities ====

Michael Larabel writes about the Intel "MMIO Stale Data" vulnerabilities. As the embargo has lifted, patches committed for Linux 5.19 are now working their way back to stable kernels as old as Linux 4.9. We are told this includes "Linux 4.9.319, Linux 4.14.284, Linux 4.19.248, Linux 5.4.199, Linux 5.10.123, Linux 5.15.48, and Linux 5.18.5". To be safe from the vulnerabilities both the kernel patch and updated firmware are required. Whilst no new firmware was released; Michael's testing reveals it likely was pushed in Intel's May 2022 CPU microcode updates. We are finally provided a means to check if our system is protected.

The CVEs are mentioned, along with a short description of the flaws, plus a list of impacted processors provided via a Intel link, as well as kernel versions that include these fixes for Ubuntu releases.
