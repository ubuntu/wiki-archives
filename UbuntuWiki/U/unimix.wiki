=== About Me ===
<nowiki>[[File:guillermolisi.png]]</nowiki>

* I am an Ubuntu Member since November 18th 2009.<<BR>>

* Member of Ubuntu Argentina LoCo Team since May 2007<<BR>>

* I've been using Ubuntu since February 2007 (Dapper). I have previous experience with Unix (Xenix and SCO) as system administrator and applications programmer in commercial enterprises. When I discovered Ubuntu, I decided to be an active member of Ubuntu community because of the amazing people you can find there and its great philosophy. In May 2007 I've signed the Ubuntu CoC to be completely commited with this community. I think technology without people has no entity, has no sense.

=== Ubuntu Contribution ===
==== Local Community ====

* I started my active local community participation organizing the Ubuntu Intrepid Ibex Release Party in Buenos Aires, supporting Tucuman and Cordoba RPs in many ways too (getting merchandising stuff and all the logistic management necessary to send it to each city from BsAs just in time for the parties, gathering pictures from each party to publish them in the Ubuntu-ar web site, etc., etc.). In this BsAs II RP I had the toaster role, introducing the keynotes speakers for each presentation and closing the mini conferences thanking all the people there for their presence and their great jobs. <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/album.php?albumid=705|Pictures here]]</nowiki><<BR>>

* I've active participation in educational Ubuntu related training course for technical personnel of Fundación Equidad, a foundation that refurbishes and donates PCs to schools and community educational institutions in Argentina. This foundation aims to release PCs with Ubuntu and FOSS software. This training was held from September to December 2008. <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/album.php?albumid=709|Pictures here]]</nowiki><<BR>>

* In November 2008 I had an active participation in the Fabrica de Fallas (Bugs Factory) at FM Radio La Tribu, in Buenos Aires. A complete open and free weekend with an Ubuntu stall, conferences and an installation room to help users who want to use Ubuntu in their PCs/notebooks, solving from complete installations to issues with video, audio, network configurations and graphics desktops tuning. Due to limitations on the Internet link of the radio, I took a repository server updated one day before, with all the ISO images for the 8.04 and 8.10 Ubuntu/Kubuntu/Xubuntu, to burn CDs, download and update packages for the people (with the collaboration of <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/mhoyos|Marco Antonio de Hoyos]]</nowiki>). <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/album.php?albumid=707|Pictures here]]</nowiki><<BR>>
 
* Since October 2008, I've been also maintaining main contents of the Argentina LoCo Team website - Ubuntu-ar - (publishing news, tutorials, translation - General and Leadership CoCs into Spanish - editing pictures to put there so as to make a "cozy" website for all the members and users. I am using Bazaar and Launchpad with Mariano Mara (Marplatense) to update some sections and maintaining all the website structure.<<BR>>

* I was in charge of the Ubuntu stall in the WhyFLOSS conferences, Universidad Tecnologica de La Plata, November 2008. <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/album.php?albumid=731|Pictures here]]</nowiki><<BR>>

* I was in charge for organization tasks for the second edition of Fabrica de Fallas, November 21st and 22nd 2009. There were the exclusive Ubuntu technical support room that had a terrific success between the people who arrived with technical problems to be solved and machines to install Ubuntu, and the traditional stall where a lot of people asked for  Ubuntu related questions. Best of all was the participation and very good work of new members of the LoCo Team, mainly in the technical support room <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/album.php?albumid=1508|Pictures here]]</nowiki><<BR>>

* <nowiki>[[http://www.afcea.org.ar/cursos/conf1_10.htm|The Argentina chapter of AFCEA]]</nowiki> invited Ubuntu-ar to give some Ubuntu related conferences.

* Organization of a new cycle of team meetings via IRC - (Beginning October 2011)<<BR>>
** Organizational (internal)
*** How to organize ourselves to achieve a good work, good results, as a team, giving equal opportunities to all the LoCo members to develop themselves and encouraging them to be Ubuntu Members<<BR>>
** UbuCon
*** I've made the proposal to organize the next UbuCon (date to be confirmed) between Ubuntu-ar and Ubuntu-uy. The idea is to gain experience in this new way of working (two LoCo Team working together), achieve good results at the end of UbuCon and then make this event a regional one, involving all South America's LoCo Teams making one annual UbuCon in different and alternate countries (<nowiki>[[http://irclogs.ubuntu.com/2011/10/28/%23ubuntu-ar.html|Meeting log]]</nowiki>)<<BR>>

==== International Community ====

* Ubuntu Forums mod since May 29th 2009. I read all the messages posted in the Argentina LoCo Team sub-forum, every day of the week from 7:30AM to 12:00PM as a regular activity, moving those threads and posts that users put out of place (we have specific sections for Hardware, Software, Community and the General Threads sections), talking with the users via PM when the things go complicated, aiming that everybody observes the CoC, moving old threads to the correct section and collaborating with other mods with things such as cross postings, bad users behaviour, post some help answers in other sub-forums (such the Chilean one) and making translations into Spanish for those written in English (there are too many people in Latin America who cannot write or read in English).<<BR>>

* Member of the "Cafeteria para Ubuntueros de habla Hispana" (Spanish Speaking Ubunteros Cafe) social group.<<BR>>
* Member of <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-uy|Ubuntu Uruguay LoCo Team]]</nowiki><<BR>>

=== I would like to ===
* Make events like UbuCon to be part of an annual South America's schedule, integrating all the spanish speaking LoCo Teams (including Brazil, why not?)<<BR>>

* Carry out all necessary actions in order to train people (of Argentina LoCo Team) in Ubuntu (as project) and make them part of the community (as Ubuntu Members), in this way the work team would become stronger and broader.<<BR>>

* Last but not least I strongly believe and intend to strengthen and reach a greater participation and integration in the Spanish Speaking Ubuntu Community Loco teams.<<BR>>

=== Testimonials ===

I am pleased with the amount and quality of Guillermo's work on the local Ubuntu Community. 
He has put a lot of effort in making the Argentina Team what it is: a sparking group of people
that believe in FLOSS and go spreading the word of Ubuntu everywhere. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PabloSajnovsky<<BR>>

Since I've know Guillermo he has shown, great collaborative spirit towards the Latinamerican community, working really hard to make us all work together, with lots of enthusiasm and being really polite by doing it. For this reasons I think he would be a great LoCo Council member. <nowiki>[[PabloRubianes]]</nowiki>
