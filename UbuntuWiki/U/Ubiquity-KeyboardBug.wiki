__TOC__

* OEM config ID
* WiFi password step
* Full Disk Encryption passphrase
* Geolocation Step
* Keyboard Step
* User Info

Currently we ask for keyboard layout as late as possible, such that installation is already running in parallel.
If one boots into a customized locale, one cannot switch to an English locale for certain inputs.

This brings the following bugs:

* Wrong locale/cannot change locale on OEM ID ( http://pad.lv/290421 )
* Wrong locale/cannot change locale on the WiFi step ( http://pad.lv/871752 )
* Full Disk Encryption passphrase locale != boot time locale ( http://pad.lv/1047384 )
* Geolocation cannot be type in Latin (~ish) locale ( http://pad.lv/630990 ) ( http://pad.lv/1055124 )
* Cannot change locale at user info step ( http://pad.lv/511956 )

There are possibly other subtle bugs like that.
