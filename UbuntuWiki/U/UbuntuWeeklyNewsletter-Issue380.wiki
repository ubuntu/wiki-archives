If you're new to everything to do with jams, you might as well already have a look at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuGlobalJam - we're gearing up for the next Ubuntu Global Jam (12-14 September)."

While he concludes that it “could be much better” he also writes “I actually didn't find anything in Unity that would prevent me from enjoyably using my Linux-powered PC. It worked, and it has been quite reliable. In fact, if Unity were the only Desktop Environment available for Linux... I would use it quite happily.”
