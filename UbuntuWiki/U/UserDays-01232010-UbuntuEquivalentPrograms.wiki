[21:00] <cjohnston> cprofitt is up next
[21:01] <cjohnston> cprofitt is a Systems Administrator who works with Windows and OS X at this day job, but is a passionate advocate for FOSS and Ubuntu.
[21:01] <cjohnston> He is an Ubuntu member, leader of the Linux User Group of Rochester, leader of the NY State Ubuntu LoCo, council member of the Ubuntu Beginners Team,
[21:01] <cjohnston> council member of the Ubuntu Community Learning Project and leader of the Ubuntu Beginners Team Security Focus Group.
[21:01] <cprofitt> Welcome everyone. I am here to discuss applications that can replace applications commonly used on OS X or Windows.
[21:01] <cprofitt> The intended audience for this session is people who have recently switched to Ubuntu (and Linux) or those debating making the switch.
[21:02] <cprofitt> The best part about many of the applications I am going to cover today is that they are cross-platform. By that, I mean that they can be run on Ubuntu, OS X or Windows. For those that are debating making the switch this will allow you to slowly make a transistion.
[21:02] <cprofitt> how many of you here today have just made the switch to Ubuntu?
[21:03] <cprofitt> How many ofyou are considering the switch... or still have Windows because you have some application you have not found an alternate for?
[21:03] <cprofitt> So first I would want to cover what I consider the 'basic' productivity applications. I admit that these applications are my opinion.
[21:03] <cprofitt> - Word Processor:  Typically Microsoft Office on both OS X and Windows though iWork is a productivity suite.
[21:03] <cprofitt> - Image editor (bitmap): This is usually Photoshop or a derivitive, like Photoshop express. Corel Photopaint is an option as well.
[21:04] <cprofitt> - Media Player: Quicktime Player or Media Player would be the two obvious choices, but you also have to factor in iTunes as a media organizer (it uses Quicktime to play media files).
[21:04] <cprofitt> - Web Browser: The default for OS X is Safari and the default for Windows is Internet Explorer. Though in this space we have to acknowledge that Firefox is used on numerous machines of both OSes.
[21:04] <cprofitt> - File Browser: Though both OS X and Windows have so entagled their file browsers that most people do not think of them as applications they are, indeed, applications. OS X uses Finder and Windows uses Windows Explorer.
[21:04] <cprofitt> those are the 'core' applications to me
[21:04] <cprofitt> I will go over some applications to replace those as well as some other applications.
[21:04] <cprofitt> The first application I am going to cover is actually an application suite. OpenOffice contains Writer, Calc, Impress and Base. The applications are substitutes for Word, Excel, Power Point and Access. I will admit that the GUI (Graphic User Interface) is not as 'pretty' as Microsoft Office, but the functionality is there to meet the needs of most users. Open Office is able to open Office Documents so the transition can be a smooth one
[21:05] <cprofitt> NATO with its 26 members (Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Turkey, the UK, and the USA) uses ODF as a mandatory standard for all members.
[21:05] <cprofitt> OpenDocument has been officially approved by national standards bodies of Brazil, Croatia, Ecuador, Hungary, Italy, Malaysia, South Korea, South Africa and Sweden.
[21:05] <cprofitt> That is 35 countries that have approved the ODF standard.
[21:05] <cprofitt> While you may not think that is a great many...
[21:05] <cprofitt> Only ten countries have approved their Office Open XML standard.
[21:06] <cprofitt> Using OpenOffice is actually a much better choice if you are concerned about standards
[21:06] <cprofitt> OpenOffice is cross-platform
[21:06] <cprofitt> OpenOffice is cross-platform
[21:06] <cprofitt> what do I mean by 'cross-platform'
[21:07] <cprofitt> I mean that you can use these applications on OS X and Windows
[21:07] <cprofitt> cross-platform applications are good for several reasons
[21:07] <cprofitt> but I find that they assist most with making the transition and being able to work with others after the transition
[21:08] <cprofitt> the fact that your OS X or Windows using friends can use these applications and exchange documents with you is important
[21:08] <cprofitt> the fact that you can use these applications and become comfortable with them prior to switching is also a key to being comfortable
[21:08] <cprofitt> do we have any questions about Open Office?
[21:09] <cprofitt> I want to take this time to also let you know that you can ask questions on this topic after the live session in the Ubuntu Forums
[21:09] <cprofitt> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=8712145
[21:10] <cprofitt> Question: Can open office accept all of the changes in a  Word(tm) document?
[21:10] <cprofitt> Yes, you can make changes to a MS Word document and either save it as in OpenDocument format or back to the original file
[21:11] <cprofitt> Question: Does the word processor have the ability to "track"  changes to the document?
[21:11] <cprofitt> I am not sure if it can track changes or not. If you post that question to the forum thread I will get an answer for you.
[21:12] <Pendulum> < tcpip4000> Question:  how versioning works in OOO?
[21:12] <cprofitt> To be honest I do not do that at all with my documents
[21:12] <cprofitt> tcpip4000: I am not sure on the versioning either. If you can post that question to the forum thread I can look that information up and get an answer for you as well.
[21:12] <cprofitt> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=8712145
[21:13] <Pendulum> < dm-madmod> QUESTION: Can OpenOffice Base use a mySQL database?
[21:14] <cprofitt> Pendulum: I have not tried that. but my understanding is yes
[21:14] <cprofitt> http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Connect_MySQL_and_Base
[21:14] <cprofitt> That is the wiki article I read on the subject
[21:14] <cprofitt> but I have not thrown up a MySQL DB yet to test it.
[21:14] <Pendulum> < userdays6_> Is printing envelopes and mail merge feature supported in OOO?
[21:15] <cprofitt> It is. I have a wiki link but it is to OO 2
[21:15] <cprofitt> http://openoffice.blogs.com/openoffice/2006/07/mail_merge_labe.html
[21:16] <cprofitt> here is another - http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/How_Tos/Creating_Mail_Merge_Documents_From_Text/CSV_or_Spreadsheets
[21:16] <cprofitt> any more questions on OO?
[21:17] <cprofitt> ok... next item
[21:17] <cprofitt> Many of us use our computers to store, catalog and modify our photographic memories. For managing photos we have F-Spot (which is a play on the phrase f-stop that is used in photography). F-Spot will import and catalog your images for you. I have not, as of yet, use F-Spot because I like to catalog my images by using my file system. For editing bitmap images (and creating them) you can use the GIMP. The GIMP is not a clone of Photoshop
[21:17] <cprofitt> For some sample work done in GIMP - http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=8712145
[21:18] <cprofitt> There I have included a Blue Planet -- made from scratch (dunno why I enjoy making those, but I do). There are also two .xcf files that were potential logos that I created for my local lug. If you have questions on those specific images please ask them in the forum thread. There is also a .png of the final logo, which was changed due to the layout of the web page for Lugor.
[21:18] <cprofitt> The GIMP is cross-platform
[21:18] <cprofitt> Do we have any questions about The GIMP?
[21:18] <Pendulum> You're good to go on :)
[21:19] <cprofitt> k
[21:19] <cprofitt> Many people need to design images that 'scale' with the need for different sizes. The best type of images for this are 'vector' images. In the Windows and OS X world that would usually require an investment of several hundred dollars for Adobe Illustrator or Corel Draw. To accomplish this type of image editing one can use Inkscape in Ubuntu. Inkscape is a powerful editor, but due to my needs focusing on bitmap images I do not have exam
[21:19] <cprofitt> One place to look at some amazing samples of vector images, as well as creative commons work for you to use, is Open Clipart Library - http://openclipart.org/
[21:19] <cprofitt> Inkscape is cross-platform
[21:19] <cprofitt> so those two applications take care of most of our image editing needs -- bitmap and vector
[21:20] <cprofitt> any questions on Inkscape?
[21:20] <Pendulum> < userdays6_> yes, i tried editing like in Ms paint, but some basic funtions were not there. Is it a substitute of Ms paint?
[21:20] <cprofitt> userdays6_: No, GIMP is more ppwerful than MS Paint
[21:20] <cprofitt> it is closer to Photoshop or Corel PhotoPaint
[21:20] <Pendulum> < bullgard> QUESTION What do you mean by "cross-platform" precisely?
[21:20] <cprofitt> the ability to add-on brushes and scripts make it much more powerful
[21:21] <cprofitt> cross-platform means it can run on OS X and Windows
[21:21] <cprofitt> in sames cases even other OSes like OS/2
[21:21] <Pendulum> < Pernig> QUESTION there was a package called gimpshop which made GIMP mimmick functionality of photoshop but it doesn't seem to work with the latest version. Is there anything similar out there?
[21:21] <cprofitt> I find that important when switchign because you can slowly make the transition and your peers can use the applications as well -- even if they do not transition to Linux
[21:22] <cprofitt> Pernig: I have not heard of a similar package to Gimpshop
[21:22] <cprofitt> You may want to file a bug or ask that question on the forum thread
[21:22] <cprofitt> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=8712145
[21:22] <Pendulum> < RPG_Master_> Question - When is GIMP going to get 16 bit support?
[21:22] <cprofitt> perhaps we can get a work around or alternative for you from the community
[21:23] <cprofitt> I was unaware they do not support 16bit, and do not know when they might add it... that would be a question for one of the developers
[21:23] <cprofitt> http://www.gimp.org/
[21:23] <Pendulum> < bullgard> QUESTION Iconsider Inkscape great. Where is it inferior to competing Ubuntu programs?
[21:24] <cprofitt> I am not following that question bullgard -- do you mean other programs in Ubuntu or programs like Illustrator?
[21:25] <cprofitt> Ok... in Ubuntu...
[21:26] <cprofitt> I am not aware of any other programs that can compete with Inkscape... for me it is the best of breed on Ubuntu
[21:26] <cprofitt> I am going to move on to the next program
[21:26] <Pendulum> < Pernig> QUESTION is therer cmyk colour support in GIMP?
[21:26] <cprofitt> Pernig: only with a plugin -- but I have heard they may be working on that
[21:27] <cprofitt> CMYK will only be important if you plan on printing your work though
[21:27] <cprofitt> please remember that if I do not get to your questions you can ask them on the forums
[21:27] <cprofitt> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=8712145
[21:27] <cprofitt> Another common program used by a typical computer user is Publisher. Publisher is mainly used to make cards, newsletters and other 'publication' type documents. In Ubuntu the program that fills this need is Scribus. http://www.scribus.net/
[21:27] <cprofitt> I have not had a need to use this software as I do not make these types of documents, but this is an excellent program for LoCo teams that need to make adevertising material for their groups. You can find excellent example of this type of work on http://spreadubuntu.neomenlo.org/ (Spread Ubuntu).
[21:28] <cprofitt> Scribus is cross-platform (even for OS/2)
[21:28] <cprofitt> Any questions on Scribus should be directed to the forums
[21:28] <cprofitt> I do not use the program, but I am sure the community will be glad to answer questions about it
[21:28] <cprofitt> Many of us like to watch movies or listen to music. Even more have portable music players and like to manage their players music with a program on their computer. The programs used outside of Ubuntu are Windows Media Player, Quicktime and iTunes. In Ubuntu we have Movie Player (Totem) and Rhythmbox.
[21:28] <cprofitt> I personally use Rhythmbox to manage my Sansa Fuze in MTP mode.
[21:29] <cprofitt> Do we have any questions about Rhythmbox or Totem?
[21:30] <cprofitt> I did not mention VLC player because it is not included in the base load of Ubuntu and there are applications that Ubuntu does include that cover that 'area'
[21:30] <cprofitt> VLC is an excellent program and is cross-platform
[21:30] <cprofitt> I used it while I was still using Windows
[21:31] <cprofitt> < patchwork_> Question- When I launch Rythymbox, it immediately docks in
[21:31] <cprofitt>                     my indicator applet without opening the window.  I then
[21:31] <cprofitt>                     have to click the indicator to open the window.  Is there
[21:31] <cprofitt>                     an easy way to make this one operation?
[21:31] <cprofitt> From my experience it opens in the last state I had it in
[21:31] <cprofitt> so if I exited directly from it being open it will open again.
[21:31] <cprofitt> the default for you 'clicking the close' x in the upper right is to minimize though
[21:32] <cprofitt> I am not aware of being able to change that behavior
[21:33] <cprofitt> I am going to move on to another area...
[21:33] <cprofitt> one that most people do not bother to think about... but that has a huge impact
[21:33] <cprofitt> One of the most basic programs included with an operating system is the file manager (or browser). In OS X that is the finder. In Windows that is Windows Explorer. In Ubuntu the default file manager is Nautilus. In KDE the default file manager is Dolphin. One of the great things about Linux is that you can change your file manager. For this session we will focus on Nautilus.
[21:33] <cprofitt> One of the things that Nautilus does very easily that the other OS file managers do not do is toggling hidden files. In nautilus all you have to do is hit cntl+h and it will toggle showing/not showing hidden files.
[21:33] <cprofitt> I can not tell you how upset I get each time I use OS X and can not see the hidden files by default
[21:34] <cprofitt> I usually just launch a terminal out of frustration
[21:34] <cprofitt> for those that do not know how to hide a file in a *nix variant
[21:34] <cprofitt> In *nix based OSes a hidden file (or folder) is hidden by placing a '.' in front of it. So to make test.txt hidden you would rename it to .test.txt
[21:34] <cprofitt> Questions on Nautilus?
[21:35] <cprofitt> Question: why doesn't rhythmbox come with dlna/upnp enable as default?
[21:35] <cprofitt> I am not sure... that would be another question for the developers
[21:35] <cprofitt> no questions on Nautilus?
[21:36] <Pendulum> < Jedemco> Question: Isn't Nautilus called "places" in Ubuntu?
[21:36] <cprofitt> < Jedemco> Question: Isn't Nautilus called "places" in Ubuntu?
[21:36] <cprofitt> No... places is a 'location' more than the program used to display it
[21:36] <cprofitt> Nautilus does open when you click one of the options under places
[21:36] <cprofitt> just like in Windows when you click on my computer it is actually windows explorer that opens
[21:37] <cprofitt> in OS X when you click on my hard drive it is finder that actually is the program
[21:37] <cprofitt> any other Q's on Nautilus?
[21:38] <Pendulum> < dm-madmod> QUESTION: When copying and pasting, the pasting sometimes doesn't work in Nautilus as there's no right-mouse paste option.  Icons works, List doesn't.
[21:38] <cprofitt> I am not sure on that dm-madmod I get a paste option with the version of Nautilus that I use...
[21:38] <cprofitt> if, however, you are trying to copy something that you do not have rights to that may cause the option to be greyed out
[21:39] <Pendulum> QUESTION: what has gone wrong that i have to load all of my applets (nm-applet for example), i can't mount my windows partition without sudo, etc
[21:39] <cprofitt> but I have not tried that.
[21:39] <cprofitt> I am not sure when your applets have to be reloaded...
[21:40] <cprofitt> and to my knoweldge you only have to use sudo when you mount a hard disk with NTFS
[21:40] <cprofitt> if you have a memory stick (usb removable media) with NTFS formatting you will not be prompted
[21:40] <cprofitt> If you use alt+f2 and type in gksu nautilus you can launch nautilus in 'sudo' mode
[21:41] <cprofitt> this may help with some of the issues people have with copying files
[21:41] <cprofitt> any more Q's on nautilus
[21:41] <cprofitt> this is really an important area when making the migration to Linux
[21:41] <cprofitt> One of the other important areas is next
[21:42] <cprofitt> An application that most Windows and OS X users ignore is the basic text editor. For this reason the basic text editors in Windows and OS X tend to be a bit on the weak side. On Windows one would use notepad and on OS X it is just called 'text editor'. On Ubuntu you have the built-in gedit which is a powerful text editor.
[21:42] <cprofitt> gedit can use its high-light mode to change what kind of file is being viewed and present a color coded view of the text making it easier to read.
[21:42] <cprofitt> If you are going to be programming there is another graphical text editor that can be used in Ubuntu called SciTE. SciTE does a bit more than gedit in that is will auto-indent per the language specifications.
[21:42] <cprofitt> Two other options in Linux are non-graphical. For basic text editing one can use nano and for programming one can use vi(m). There is another option for programming, but it is more like an OS unto itself than a simple editor. It is called emacs.
[21:42] <cprofitt> SciTE is cross-platform
[21:42] <cprofitt> I will not go in to the greatness that is sed or awk in this session, but those looking to manipulate text should look at those as well
[21:43] <cprofitt> Any questions of basic text editors?
[21:44] <cprofitt> OK... as we do not apear to have any more questions on text editors I will move on
[21:44] <cprofitt> Some more exoteric applications that are used in the world of Windows and OS X are applications like Inspiration and Quick Books / Microsoft Money.
[21:44] <cprofitt> In Ubuntu you can use Freemind for mind mapping software. You can use GnuCash for managing your business. I do not have experience with either of these applications and if you want more information please check out the wiki entry for this session: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UserDays/01232010/UbuntuEquivalentPrograms and feel free to ask questions on the forum thread: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=8712145
[21:45] <cprofitt> This was meant to be a simple overview of some of the basic applications in Ubuntu.
[21:45] <cprofitt> There are cetainly many applications that I may have not covered. For those you can check out two sites to find recommendations.
[21:45] <cprofitt> Linux App Finder - http://linuxappfinder.com/
[21:45] <cprofitt> OS Alt - http://www.osalt.com/
[21:45] <cprofitt> < scunizi> There is also Vym for mindmapping
[21:45] <cprofitt> I would like to thank scunizi for mentioning this
[21:46] <cprofitt> I just read about the program today and it does look solid
[21:46] <cprofitt> thanks scunizi
[21:46] <cprofitt> Again, feel free to discuss other applications in the forum thread as well. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=8712145
[21:46] <cprofitt> I thank you all for coming. Are there any other questions before we end?
[21:46] <cprofitt> we can opne questions to any of the applications covered
[21:47] <cprofitt> and remember that the forum thread is open to all the apps covered and those that were not covered
[21:47] <Pendulum> < Pernig> Question Not come acrosds mind mapping software before, could you briefly explain?
[21:48] <cprofitt> Mind mapping software is kind of a flow of thoughts...
[21:48] <cprofitt> you link them in the order that you thought of them...
[21:49] <cprofitt> it is used in education a great deal
[21:49] <Pendulum> < userdays6_> yes, I wanted a substitute for dreamweaver, but I got compozer and it is not much helpful. Can you suggest a better alternative?
[21:49] <cprofitt> yes, I wanted a substitute for dreamweaver, but  I got compozer and it is not much helpful. Can you suggest  a better alternative?
[21:49] <cprofitt> http://linuxappfinder.com/alternatives?search_text=Dreamweaver
[21:50] <cprofitt> personally the one I have heard the best about is Bluefish
[21:50] <cprofitt> http://linuxappfinder.com/package/bluefish
[21:50] <cprofitt> Question: How come Daap plug-in in rhythmbox works with Itunes?
[21:51] <cprofitt> To be honest I am not sure why it works with iTunes. I stay as far aware from iTunes as possible. That is why I got my Sansa Fuze -- it supports .ogg and .flac files and works out of the box with Ubuntu
[21:52] <cprofitt> any other questions?
[21:53] <cprofitt> What are the issues with editing music files?
[21:53] <cprofitt> I have been able to edit the genre, title, etc...
[21:54] <cprofitt> for editing the music I go in to Rhythmbox and right click ont he song -- then hit properties
[21:54] <cprofitt> I can edit the details on that dialog box
[21:55] <Pendulum> < Pernig> QUESTION are there any alternatives to empathy and pidgin with similar or better features?
[21:56] <cprofitt> I do not use those two apps Pernig, but I would ask that in the forum thread
[21:56] <cprofitt> Again, feel free to discuss other applications in the forum thread as well. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=8712145
[21:57] <cprofitt> Question: if i wan to program in C# or vb.net can linux alternative
[21:57] <cprofitt> you can kind of do C# with mono
[21:57] <cprofitt> but I am not aware of an implenetation that allows vb.net
[21:57] <cprofitt> personally, I moved away from .Net and am now learning Python
[21:58] <cprofitt> Eclipse is in the repos and does have a mono plugin I believe
[21:58] <cprofitt> a great area to ask about programming is the forums area dedicated to it
[21:58] <cprofitt> http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=39
[21:58] <cprofitt> we have two minutes left before our next session...
[21:59] <cprofitt> with the illustrious Mr. Castro helping us all to get Involved in the Ubuntu Community
[22:00] <cprofitt> Thank you to this event for helping me be involved in the Ubuntu Community
[22:00] <Pendulum> Thank you cprofitt :)
[22:00] <cprofitt> I hope that many of you here today will continue to become more comfortable
