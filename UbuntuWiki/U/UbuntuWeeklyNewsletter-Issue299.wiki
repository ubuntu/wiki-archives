=== Featured Audio and Video ===

==== Ubuntu Ohio - Burning Circle: Burning Circle Episode 96 ====

“This week's episode mentions **Ubuntu Phone** briefly, talks about the need for discussion on the mailing list about an upcoming educational session for the Lo``Co on IRC, the standing *promise* that if there is a lack of discussion the first educational topic is going to be a discussion of **"The Joy of the Beagle``Board"**, and the need for bug squashing in Debian Wheezy which will trickle down to help Ubuntu.”

==== Ubuntu Audiocast - Episode 04 ====

Members of the Vancouver team present the latest in their series of Ubuntu Audio``Casts.

"After a much deserved holiday, Your Ubuntu Audio``Cast crew, Chuck, Bucky, and Philbare are back with Episode 4! They openly talk about people who are being controlled by their computers (and don't even know it), how to make a great steak, creepy marketing, and much more. They frequently mention Ubuntu, too, but not enough to bore your mom's aunt's dog."
