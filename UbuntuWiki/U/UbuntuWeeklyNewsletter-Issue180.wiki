==== Ubuntu Opportunistic Developer Week: Call For Participation! ====

In the continued interests of helping to make Ubuntu rock as a platform for scratching itches and making awesome apps, Jono Bacon is putting together a new online learning event: Ubuntu Opportunistic Developer Week, happening online between 1st – 6th March 2010. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuOpportunisticDeveloperWeek

The week will be just like the previous online learning events such as Ubuntu Developer Week and Ubuntu Open Week, but instead providing a week jam packed with awesome sessions about writing applications that scratch your itch, and predominantly focusing on Python tools and frameworks, Bazaar, Launchpad and infrastructure. The goal for the week is give attendees a head start on a given technology useful for applications.

Jono is looking for volunteers. If you feel you could give a tutorial about a given Python module or associated technology (e.g. Glade, Launchpad, Bazaar etc), please drop him an email at jono AT ubuntu DOT com and he will liaise with you to get it scheduled. Jono is also look for some showcase sessions: stories about how you put together an application, how it scratched your itch and what tools you used.

==== Interview With Jono by Joe Barker ====

Joe Barker recently interview Canonical's community manager Jono Bacon. If you've been active in the Ubuntu community, you'll know who Jono is, but if you don't, here's your chance to get to know him on a more personal basis. The following are the questions Jono responded to. You can find his answers at the link that follows. Be sure to take a few minutes to read the entire interview.

* Tell as much as you’re willing about your “real life” like name, age, gender, location, family, religion, profession, education, hobbies, etc.
* When and how did you become interested in computers? in Linux? in Ubuntu?
* When did you become involved in the forums (or the Ubuntu community)? What’s your role there?
* Are you an Ubuntu member? If so, how do you contribute? If not, do you plan on becoming one?
* What distros do you regularly use? What software? What’s your favorite application? Your least favorite?
* What’s your fondest memory from the forums, or from Ubuntu overall? What’s your worst?
* What luck have you had introducing new computer users to Ubuntu?
* What would you like to see happen with Linux in the future? with Ubuntu?
* If there was one thing you could tell all new Ubuntu users, what would it be?

==== Interview with Dustin Kirkland, Ubuntu Core Developer about encryption in Ubuntu ====

Dustin Kirkland is an Ubuntu Core Developer, working for Canonical on the Ubuntu Server. His current focus is developing the Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud for the Ubuntu 10.04 LTS release, but previously he had worked on a number of Ubuntu features and packages, including Ubuntu's Encrypted Home Directories. He is also the upstream maintainer of eCryptfs, the cryptographic filesystem used to provide Encrypted Home Directories. Those are fair enough reasons to ask him a couple of questions. If you're wanting to learn more about encryption and the thought processes behind it, this is a great read. See the entire interview at the link below.

=== LoCo News ===

==== Upcoming Ubuntu Global Jam and your Loco Team ====

The dates for the Global Jam for this cycle are the 26th through the 28th of March 2010. We are hoping to make this Global Jam extremely successful, and we need your help in doing it. We want to have events in as many places as possible, not only to help improve Ubuntu, but also to help promote it. The Ubuntu Global Jam is an online and in person event that takes place all across the world. People get together with the interest of making Ubuntu better, while having a good time socializing with other people in your area who have the same interest and passion about Ubuntu as you do.

What can your Lo``Co do? The Ubuntu Global Jam has many different events that for users to participate in, just pick one that you and your team like, and make it happen. You can pick from one or more of the following events:

* Bug Jam – During a bug jam users would work on finding, triaging and fixing bugs.
* Testing Jam – Lucid is due out the end of April and we need help testing it out prior to its release.
* Upgrade Jam – Upgrade systems that are currently running older versions of Ubuntu and report your experience.
* Documentation Jam – Write documentation about using Ubuntu, or joining the Ubuntu community, or work on making the existing documentation better.
* Translations Jam – Help to make Ubuntu available to everyone. Help translate Ubuntu into your language.
* Packaging Jam – Help out with improving packages in Ubuntu.
* Other – If your team has some other aspect of helping out the Ubuntu Community, feel free to participate in that for the Global Jam.

If you have never run a Global Jam event before, or if you have, but would like some fresh ideas, we have three training sessions scheduled between now and the kick off of the Global Jam. The training sessions will be hosted by Jorge Castro and will be held in #ubuntu-locoteams on freenode. The training sessions will take place on:

* 17 February 2010 at 18:00 UTC
* 26 February 2010 at 21:00 UTC
* 10 March 2010 at 21:00 UTC

All three training sessions will contain tips, tricks, pointers and advice on how to run a Jam. You can also find out more information at the Running An Event page on the Ubuntu Wiki. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Jams

You can also find out what other Lo``Co teams have done in the past for Global Jam by visiting this wiki page: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuGlobalJam/Stories

==== Ubuntu Honduras Loco Team at the T3 conference ====

What is T3? It is an event organized by the EIS School in the city of San Pedro Sula. More than 37 teachers and principals will be on hand for this event. It was a great opportunity to show them about the open source world and about Ubuntu linux. The team was given 2 hours for our presentation. The first hour covered what is open source, GNU/Linux and Ubuntu. The second hour was a workshop so teachers can get familiar with Ubuntu.

==== Jono Bacon: Ubuntu Opportunistic Developer Week Update ====

Earlier this week I announced the plan to put together Ubuntu Opportunistic Developer Week: a week of IRC tuition sessions aimed at helping opportunistic developers scratch their itches and write fun and useful programs using our awesome platform. The week takes place from 1st – 6th March 2010. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuOpportunisticDeveloperWeek

The response so far to the call for sessions has been fantastic, and we already have many sessions scheduled, all visible from the timetable here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuOpportunisticDeveloperWeek

Each of these sessions is designed to give you a taste of the topic and get you up and running, enough to be productive and start exploring the features of the tool being discussed. In addition to this we will have a series of showcase sessions:

* SHOWCASE: Gwibber – Ken Van``Dine
* SHOWCASE: Lernid – Jono Bacon
* SHOWCASE: Photobomb – Rick Spencer

These sessions explain the story behind the app: talking about which tools, modules and technology that was used to put these apps together and what challenges were solved. This is a great way to learn more about tools available for opportunistic developers so that when you need to do something, you know which tool to reach out for.

Many of you will be entirely new to Python and entirely new to coding. To give you folks a head start before the week kicks off, Rick Spencer from the desktop team will be running some beginners Python tuition sessions on the Thursday before Ubuntu Opportunistic Developer Week:

* Thu 25th Feb 2010 – 15.00 UTC – Ubuntu Opp Dev Week Prep: Intro to Python for total beginners – Rick Spencer
* Thu 25th Feb 2010 – 16.00 UTC – Ubuntu Opp Dev Week Prep: Intro to Python for programmers – Rick Spencer

We are still looking for sessions, and if you want to contribute and give one, just drop me an email at jono AT ubuntu DOT com.

http://www.jonobacon.org/2010/02/11/ubuntu-opportunistic-developer-week-update/

==== David Planella: Call for feedback on preferred desktop fonts ====

While trying to offer a better experience for users in all languages and trying to balance that with features, we are faced with the fact that the space on the Live CD is limited. Fonts in particular take a lot of space, and we’d like to reduce that to the minimum necessary in order to have a reduced set to correctly display all languages. These will then be collected in an ‘ubuntu-desktop-fonts‘ package.

This will only be for the Live CD. In an installation with network connectivity all required font packages, writing aids, etc. will be downloaded and installed as usual. This will also not yet solve the issue whereby only a few languages are included on the CD, but will free some more space on it and avoid duplication.

Arne Götje has started a wiki page to collect feedback on this, and I’d like to ask you to add the information for your particular language/script combination and complete the tables at:

* https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Translations/PreferredFonts

Here’s how you can do it:

* Look for your language/script on the list. If it does not fall in any of the existing categories, you can just add it
* If the current font for basic display of messages is correct, simply add an “OK” note to the Remarks column.
* If not, please suggest a better font (a maximum of two, in order of preference) and add a note on the Remarks column as well
* That’s it! If you’ve got any questions, feel free to ask them to the translations team: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Translations/Contact/

==== Dell dropping its Ubuntu offerings? ====

Christina Tynan-Wood of Info World comments that purchasing a preinstalled Linux system may have gotten a little harder, as one Gripe Line reader and loyal Dell customer recently found out. "I've always supported Dell and enjoyed the availability of the company's Linux systems," writes Cal. "But I was recently appalled when a Dell sales rep hung up on me when I tried to order some Linux systems for my business. The Dell rep made it clear that unless I wanted Windows, Dell didn't want my money." Could this be so? Christina headed to Dell.com to find out, and she browsed to the Business section and ticked the Free``DOS and Linux button to filter out all but open source systems. The site returned only a handful of laptops and no desktops, so she called the sales line to see whether they could set her up. Christina contacted Dell representative Anne Camden who told her, "I suspect that what is going on here is that we recently refreshed most of our consumer desktop portfolio, and unfortunately the Linux model is lagging and is not currently available," she says. "We will offer Ubuntu pre-installed again in the future, but it will not be for several weeks." http://www.infoworld.com/d/adventures-in-it/dell-dropping-its-ubuntu-offerings-243

==== Ubuntu 9.10 and GNOME 2.28: Advancing Past Meh ====

Linux``Planet's Carla Schroder says that many eons ago, GNOME 1.4 still lived, and it was good. Fast-forward eight years to Ubuntu 9.10, and in Schroder's opinion this is the first *buntu and the first GNOME that have gotten past "meh" on her Wow``Meter. After a week of running Ubuntu 9.10 Schroder says she is dangerously close to being impressed.  Carla thinks the most important test of a distribution is how it performs over time. Does it improve? Do bugs get fixed? Does it handle changes competently? Will it upgrade gracefully to a new release? This is on her audio production computer, so Schroder says it's going to get a serious workout. Carla says that there is one comparison that she cannot resist making: the default installation from the Live``CD uses about 2.8GB of hard disk space, and in that 2.8GB you get a wealth of applications. Windows 7 clocks in at over 12GB, and what do you get? Um, Notepad? http://www.linuxplanet.com/linuxplanet/reviews/6976/1/

==== Univ. of Arizona student builds Ubuntu-Atom powered spider-bot ====

 Matt Bunting, a electrical engineering student at the University of Arizona, has been attracting some attention with his latest creation: a six-legged robot that he built for a class on cognitive robotics. The spider-bot, or hexapod as it is more properly known, is powered by a fairly low-cost, off-the-shelf 1.6GHz Intel Atom processor, running on a US15W chipset. The software runs off of a Ubuntu Linux OS. The most significant feature that Matt's yet-unnamed robot creation has is an adaptive capacity to walk. Matt's prof was impressed with his work: "I see that this device might be doing scientific work like autonomous navigation, mapping of different environments, moving over rough terrain and doing exploration, possibly planetary exploration...I think Matt's robot has a lot of possibilities. It's really not so far-fetched that a robot like this could go to Mars." Even folks at Intel heard of Matt's robot. And after a seeing video of it in action, they decided to order two from him to use as promotional robots for the Atom processor. See the video of Matt's creation at the link below.

==== AbiWord & Gnumeric To Replace OpenOffice in Ubuntu Netbook Edition ====

On February 8, 2010, OMG!Ubuntu shares with readers the decision to drop OpenOffice.org suite of applications from the default install of Ubuntu 10.04 Netbook Edition.  According to the article and statement from Ubuntu developer, Rick Spencer, "I think we should try GNUMeric and abiword by default, and then those who want OOo apps can install just the ones they need later."  The article also points out that most people agree Open``Office.org was overkill on small, underpowered netbooks. http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/02/few-days-ago-we-shared-word-that.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+d0od+(Omg!+Ubuntu!)

==== It's Not The Hokey Cokey; OpenOffice BACK In Ubuntu Netbook Edition After User Outcry ====

On February 11, 2010, OMG!Ubuntu reports on that because of the community response to Open``Office being dropped from Ubuntu Netbook Edition of Ubuntu 10.04, the early decision now has developers rethinking their decision.  In this February 11 article, OMG!Ubuntu let's readers know that the decision to use Abi``Word and GNUMeric has been fully reversed and Open``Office will be installed by default.  Here is what Ubuntu developer, Rick Spencer has to say about the reversal. "All in all it seems that users and community members would really prefer that we ship OOo for the editing suite. We discussed a bit in #ubuntu-desktop this morning and decided that we should probably switch back to OOo, which we will do on Monday if we don't hear anything that makes us change our minds again." http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/02/openoffice-back-in-ubuntu-netbook.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+d0od+(Omg!+Ubuntu!)

==== Canonical’s Latest Ubuntu Developer Pitch ====

Joe Panettieri, Works``With``U, discusses Ubuntu Opportunistic Developer Week, which is scheduled for March 1-6, 2010. Panettieri notes, "Canonical is making multiple moves to engage and energize Ubuntu software developers. " Panettieri notes that there are two moves worth watching with "Canonical has made multiple moves to strengthen the Ubuntu ISV story. Incoming COO Matt Asay arrives with a big Rolodex filled with ISV contacts and boardroom relationships." and "Jono Bacon, Canonical’s Ubuntu Community Manager, is preparing an online learning event called Ubuntu Opportunistic Developer Week."
Panettieri states that, "Works``With``U will closely watch the Ubuntu Opportunistic Developer Week for more potential signs of progress." http://www.workswithu.com/2010/02/09/canonicals-latest-ubuntu-developer-pitch/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+WorksWithU+(Works+With+U)
