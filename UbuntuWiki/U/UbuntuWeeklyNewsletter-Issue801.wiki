==== Why I use Ubuntu ====

Alan Pope decides to spend 20 minutes telling us why he (still) uses Ubuntu. He acknowledges the post gets long, and thus gives a short "tldr" : he likes it & it works, familiarity, has good security, software availability & is consistent. We're given a brief history of Alan's Linux exploration, before trying Ubuntu first in 2005. We're told Alan doesn't only use Ubuntu, but told why he continues to use it. Lastly we're given some "reasons not to be cheerful" or a few gripes (mainly with Canonical) but he still believes the good outweighs the bad.

==== Linux Reworks AMD Zen 1 Divide-By-Zero Mitigation After Original Fix Inadequate ====

Michael Larabel firstly reminds us of the AMD Inception vulnerability, then tells us another AMD Zen CPU bug has been discovered that can leak data. We're told the "original workaround" was insufficient, thus a new patch has been created. Michael quotes AMD Linux engineer Borislav Petkov, and provides a link to the patch. The patch is expected to land on Linux 6.5-rc7.
