==== Meizu MX4 Ubuntu hands-on review ====

Alastair Stevenson for V3 quickly reviews the Meizu MX4 Ubuntu Phone looking at the operating system, performance, camera, battery life and internal storage.

==== Review: Dell's Ubuntu-powered M3800 Mobile Workstation is a desktop destroyer ====

Bryan Lunduke of Network World reviews the Dell M3800 Mobile Workstation which doubles as a Linux-powered desktop replacement that ships with Ubuntu. He pays special attention to the performance while running games, the ease of installing and running other Linux distros, and the high resolution display which he says is too high for some software that won't adapt. He sums up by saying: "This is a ‘no compromise’ complete mobile workstation with fantastic Linux support. It's not cheap, but if this is the type of system you need – and I know many of you do – the price is worth it."
