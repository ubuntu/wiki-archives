==== Founder of Ubuntu Linux: No Back Doors; No Weakening of Encryption ====

C. Mitchell Shaw writes that Mark Shuttleworth has affirmed Ubuntu’s commitment to security by stating that the distribution will never have built in back doors or weakened encryption. Writing of the virtues of open source, he concludes “There would simply be no way for a backdoor to be hidden in the source code, since millions of eyes are on it.”

Terry Relph-Knight of ZDNet provides his review of the recently released Aquaris M10 Ubuntu edition tablet, the first Ubuntu tablet to offer desktop-mobile convergence. He concludes that although the device will likely only garner interest from diehard Ubuntu fans and determined early adopters in its current state due to software issues, these issues may be easily rectified in the near future.

==== Ubuntu 16.10: What To Expect from Unity 7 ====

During the planning for 16.10 at the Ubuntu Online Summit it was announced that Unity 8 / Mir will not be default. Unity 8 still has it’s share of rough edges to get smooth out before being pushed to millions of Ubuntu machines. 

http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2016/05/what-to-expect-ubuntu-16-10-unity-7

==== Unity 8 and Snaps Are the Future of the Ubuntu Desktop, After Ubuntu 16.10 ====

Planning are being made with snaps being used on Ubuntu a lot more, from major applications only being in snap format to change deb installed applications into snaps during an upgrade. Unity 7 will also just receive OEM work and critical/major bug fixed. 

http://news.softpedia.com/news/unity-8-and-snappy-are-the-future-of-the-ubuntu-desktop-after-ubuntu-16-10-503735.shtml

==== Unity 8 suffers another delay (and how to solve this issue) ====

Jack Wallen of Tech Republic proposes two solutions to the delays of Unity: migrate all of their desktop developers to Unity 8 or delay the release of Ubuntu. He goes in depth on both these ideas, and concludes “Unity 8 will be worth the wait.”
