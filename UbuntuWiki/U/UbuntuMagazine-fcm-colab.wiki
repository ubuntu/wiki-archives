This page reflects the current development status of the fcm-colab dream app, please do not edit.

== This page is not done yet, do not read please ==

== Brief Overview ==
FCM-colab is the codename of the Full Circle Magazine Dream App. A project which focuses on helping the development community of of Full Circle Magazine. It will include two main parts, a front end in which users can submit queries, ideas, article and other content. And a backend where developers, proofers and other full time contributors can control the magazine.

== About the Project ==
Our public svn repository can be found at http://fcm-colab.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/fcm-colab/

To help develop contact us at fcmdev@fullcirclemagazine.org

* Lead Developer: Ttech
* Other Developers: Catfacts, Mrmonday, Linuxgeeky
* Project Coordinator: Ronnietucker

== Full Overview ==
For the original post go to: http://fullcirclemagazine.org/fcmapp/

=== Text Editor ===

When an item is clicked on the lister it is viewed in the WYSIWYG text editor. This should have US spell checking by default and any images from the item would be shown at the end of the text as small thumbnail previews. Any of the team members would be able to edit this text, this is effectively step one in proof-reading. The viewer should also have an ‘archive and email’ facility to have an entire article emailed to a specified email address or team member.

=== Team Members ===

This is a list of members who can either be administrators who have access to all steps of the process or be proof-readers who only have access to the text editing and ‘proofing pad’ (see later) steps.

=== Administrators ===

Administrators should have access to all steps and configuration of the process but also have access to an ‘Event Scheduler’.

=== Event Scheduler ===

The Event Scheduler would allow administrators to assign tasks to team members and also set deadlines all done on a visual calendar. The deadline setting should email all team members (unless told otherwise) several days before deadline to remind them (with a predefined message) that the deadline is approaching. The administrator could also create a ‘To-Do’ list with each event being an article assigned to a specific team member. The email lister would check email headers against this To-Do list. If the writer emails his article in with the subject line of ‘[Q&A] here it is’ and the email lister has a criteria of ‘[Q&A]’ linked to a To-Do then upon receiving the email the Event Scheduler would automatically check the Q&A To-Do as done. The Event Scheduler would also email anyone with a To-Do when the deadline is approaching.

=== Proofing Pad ===

When an issue has reached preview status the PDF would be uploaded to the Proofing Pad. When the PDF is uploaded all the members tagged as proof-readers would be sent an email. When they click the PDF file it should be displayed in their browser but have a notepad beside the PDF. While the proof-reader examines the PDF file, they can type into the notepad any errors they see in the PDF. When they click the Send button the Proofing Pad should email the Editor (of the magazine) with their notes. This could be repeated for a second time if a second proof-reading is required.

=== Calendar ===

All of the sections above are linked to the Calendar. All Team Members have access to the calendar and can add items to the calendar so, for example, if a proof-reader is not available for two weeks in December they would add this to the calendar, the Proofing Pad should not email that person when a PDF is uploaded in that two week time span. If a writer is not available then a To-Do should not be allowed for that person in the time they are away. Same for the deadline.

=== Podcast Specific Featurs ===

==== Upload Audio ====
This would be a backend feature for people like Matt who publish the podcast. It would allow him to upload the podcast and take care of exporting the RSS and sending subscribers email reminders.

==== Edit Show Notes ====
This would go along with the previous idea, allowing Matt to type show notes up, most likely on the same page as the audio uploader page, and then add the shownotes to the RSS all at once.

==== Send Email ====
Matt Please Edit

==== Submit Ideas ====
Matt Please Edit

==== Public Tumble Blog ====

The idea of the Public Tumble Blog is to allow users to submit links to the stories that they want to see discussed on the show.  There is an Ideas Tank wiki page in the FullCirclePodcast section which was implemented to collect ideas.

==== Public Voicemail ====

The idea of the Public Voicemail is that a listener can send us an audio message which gets played back on the show.

Example:

Bob decides to email in an article to full circle which he emails to articles@fullcirclemagazine.org. His attachment is a .tar file which contains an .ODT article with several images.

Solution:  The email catcher accepts the email and unarchives the attachment passing the ODT and images to the lister. An administrator logs in, looks at the article and decides to tag it as a ‘How-To’ for ‘Issue #9′. That email is marked as read and tagged. A proof-reader logs in, sees the new article, clicks it and moves to the text editor. Here they correct a few spelling mistakes and save it. On deadline the Editor logs in and does an ‘archive and email’ on all items tagged as ‘Issue #9′. He now has all the articles needed for Issue #9 and can start importing articles in to Scribus.

Initial Set Up: 

Before an issue is begun an Administrator would log in to the Event Scheduler > Calendar and set up a series of reoccurring events such as meetings, deadlines and so on and whether they apply to all Team Members and if they apply to all future issues. These settings can be turned on/off on a per issue or per person basis.

You can only use this idea and create the software if:
a) it is free and open source software and:
b) Full Circle Magazine is given credit for the idea and full use of the software!
