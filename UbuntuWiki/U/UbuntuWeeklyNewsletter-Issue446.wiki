=== Other Community News ===

==== Online searches in the dash to be off by default. ====

Will Cooke reminds us that Unity 7 scopes, which were introduced with 12.10, added results from online searches to the dash home screen. He says that in Unity 8 the scopes concept has evolved; this ‘evolution’ cannot be added to Unity 7 so the decision has been made to gracefully retire some aspects of the online search features in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

==== UAVIA unveils first 100% remotely controlled drones; powered by Ubuntu ====

Thibaut Rouffineau writes about UAVIA’s first 100% remotely controlled drones, which are powered by Ubuntu.
