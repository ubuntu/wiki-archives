__TOC__

The URL dispatcher project is hosted in <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/url-dispatcher|Launchpad]]</nowiki>.

=== User Documentation ===

Documentation on using URL Dispatcher as an application developer is now available on the developer website:

<nowiki>[[https://developer.ubuntu.com/en/start/platform/guides/url-dispatcher-guide/]]</nowiki>

=== URLs with multiple handlers ===

(bug Bug:1378350)

<nowiki>[[File:multiple-apps.png]]</nowiki>

Whenever the URL dispatcher is called on to open an address that multiple apps have registered for, it should open a “Use App” dialog, with a centered grid of labelled buttons with the icon for each applicable app, followed by a “Cancel” button.

=== Unsupported URLs ===

(bug Bug:1370008)

<nowiki>[[File:unrecognized-address.png]]</nowiki>

Whenever the URL dispatcher is called on to open an address of a protocol that it does not understand (`url-dispatcher-bad-url`), it should open an alert with the title “Unrecognized Address”, text of the form ‘Ubuntu can’t open addresses of type “{protocol:}”.’, and an “OK” button. To prevent denial of UI service, however, the alert should not open if it has already opened more than three times in the past minute.
