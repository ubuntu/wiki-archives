__TOC__

We need screenshots for all supported languages that will be included in the tour. This page details how to take them.

== Standards ==

Screenshots must be taken using the <nowiki>[[http://ubuntutour.org/images/default-desktop.jpeg|default theme and wallpaper]]</nowiki> in Ubuntu 10.10. The username must be ubuntu_tour. To make sure you have the right setup, you can download and liveboot our <nowiki>[[http://releases.alexandos.org/ubuntu-10.10-desktop-i386_ubuntu-tour-screenshots.iso|screenshot CD]]</nowiki> which is an updated version of the 10.10 beta with the new themes (and the default user is ubuntu_tour). Apologies, this live CD does not have bzr installed.

What tool you use does not matter. We recommend the gnome-screenshot tool with time delays or the printscreen button.

Please use .png images! We can easily turn .pngs into .jpgs, but we cannot do the reverse.

== Uploading ==

Screenshots are to go in our <nowiki>[[https://code.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-tour/ubuntu-tour/maverick|bzr branch]]</nowiki> (see <nowiki>[[http://ubuntutour.org/contribute/branch|here]]</nowiki> for instructions on getting it).

Store screenshots in the folder chapter-name/langcode/images. Screenshots should be named in the same format as the following names: '''panel_system-menu_open.png''', '''firefox.png''', '''firefox_url-search-bars.png'''.

== Picky Details ==

* When taking screenshots of a window, do so over the desktop (to avoid mismatched corners).
* When showing menus, the contents must be the default ones. This is a good use for our live CD.
* Do not show the mouse if the mouse is not doing something.
* If the text refers to a menu item that is to be clicked on or selected, highlight that item when taking the screenshot.
