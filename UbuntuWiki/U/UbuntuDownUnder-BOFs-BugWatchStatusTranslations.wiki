=== Introduction ===

A ''bug watch'' allows a bug in an upstream bug tracker to be monitored through Malone. When the status of the bug in the upstream bug tracker changes, Malone can notice that and send a notification to the subscribers of the Malone bug letting them know of this status change. This document describes how Malone will translate an upstream status (e.g. "Resolved") into a Malone status (e.g. "Fixed".)
