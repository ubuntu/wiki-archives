==== Mesa's RADV Vulkan Driver Holds A Narrowing Lead Over AMDVLK With Ubuntu 21.10 On Wayland ====

Michael Larabel's testing of the AMDVLK 2021.Q4.3 open-source Vulkan driver reveals vastly improved performance when running under Wayland. Michael provides his benchmark results comparing Mesa's RADV alternative Vulkan driver on several games, as the base for testing. The final analysis: though AMDVLK is performing better and on par, gamers are advised to remain on the Mesa RADV driver due to the better gaming support.
