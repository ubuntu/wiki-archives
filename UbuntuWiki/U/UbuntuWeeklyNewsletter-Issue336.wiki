=== The Planet ===

==== Nicholas Skaggs: Spreading the (testing) weight ====
Nicholas Skaggs writes that the Ubuntu Quality Team has gained responsibilities other than the reporting of bugs on the latest desktop development images and building tools.  Because handling test cases for the Ubuntu touch images and apps is adding some undue "weight", the Ubuntu CI team was born to specialize in Ubuntu Touch-related testing. Nicholas also hopes that the Ubuntu Quality team will have a better vision for the next cycle.

==== Jonathan Riddell: Switching to Kubuntu comments ====

Jonathan Riddell quotes some comments from a recent Slashdot article about switching to Kubuntu.

http://blogs.kde.org/2013/09/26/switching-kubuntu-comments

==== Nicholas Skaggs: A vision for our testing future ====

Nicholas Skaggs writes about bringing the Quality team closer to automation and proposes that the group take an exploratory approach to manual test cases, start writing more automated test cases, and manually test phablet devices. Nicholas also explains how these actions are necessary and how they will affect the team.

http://www.theorangenotebook.com/2013/09/a-vision-for-our-testing-future.html

==== Benjamin Kerensa: Ubuntu Dash Search Is Still Not Anonymous ====

Benjamin Kerensa writes that the "Ubuntu Dash Search is very much still not anonymous despite several Canonical employees announcing otherwise on Google+" and links to some posts that summarize why.

=== In The Blogosphere ===

==== Canonical is gold sponsor at October 2013's OggCamp open-source event ====

razvi from iloveubuntu.net tells us that Canonical is a gold sponsor at Ogg``Camp, which is happening next 18th October. He says, “The Ogg``Camp sponsoring is yet-another evidence of Canonical's awareness of and participation in the open-source ecosystem, and of its deep and constantly-maintained interest in pushing forward the adoption of open-source collaborative software and projects at a planetary scale”.

http://iloveubuntu.net/canonical-gold-sponsor-october-2013s-oggcamp-open-source-event

==== Are We Witnessing the Decline of Ubuntu? ====

Bruce Byfield from Datamation writes an article about how they see the current status of Ubuntu and its relation with Canonical. Byfield writes "Ubuntu and Canonical have isolated themselves from the free software community that Shuttleworth once hoped to lead. In the last year, the community has signaled repeatedly that at least parts of it feel disempowered."

http://www.datamation.com/open-source/are-we-witnessing-the-decline-of-ubuntu-1.html

==== Ubuntu 13.04 vs. Ubuntu 13.10 In A VMware VM ====

Michael Labarel from Phoronix writes a comparison between Raring and Saucy running in a VMware VM and concludes: "Long story short, there wasn't too much to get excited about. While there's an updated kernel several releases ahead, the Mesa 9.2 graphics stack, GCC 4.8, etc, it didn't translate to much of a difference in the VMware Fusion guest."

http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTQ2OTg

==== Ubuntu converged's Ubuntu System Settings received Bluetooth support ====

razvi from iloveubuntu tells us about the now supported feature of Bluetooth for Ubuntu Touch, writing: "Basically, the new Bluetooth addition gives depth and dedicated view to the main view's Bluetooth icon; clicking on it, shifts the Ubuntu System Settings' view to a Bluetooth view where the user is to notice the handy ON/OFF switch for bluetooth. Moreover, Connect a headset shows interesting upcoming features, where probably bluetooth-related devices are to be managed and tweaked accordingly."

==== Dell Still Offers Ubuntu Amid Microsoft Loan, Windows 8.1 ====

The VAR Guy addresses the recent privatization of Dell that included a loan from Microsoft and explores the impact that has had on their Ubuntu offering. He writes that the loan, "which will include a big Windows 8.1 push, has not upended Dell's continued work with Ubuntu, the Linux distribution that has found a home on millions of desktops, servers and mobile devices." He continues, "Dell sees Ubuntu as a potential springboard into a range of international markets. A case in point: Dell is expanding the number of China retail stores that carry its computers with Ubuntu pre-installed."
