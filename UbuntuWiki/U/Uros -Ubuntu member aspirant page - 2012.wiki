=== Goals ===
==== Stronger cooperation with other free software teams in My country ====
Although  already collaborating with local free software communities, such as:
* <nowiki>[[http://ns-linux.org/|LUGoNS]]</nowiki> (Linux user group Novi Sad) <nowiki>[[http://www.flickr.com/photos/ubuntu-srbija/sets/72157618033816322/|images]]</nowiki>, 
* <nowiki>[[http://www.mozilla-srbija.org|Mozilla Serbia]]</nowiki> (community of Mozilla developers), 
* <nowiki>[[http://rs.wikimedia.org|Wikimedia Foundation Serbia]]</nowiki>, 
* <nowiki>[[http://mint-srbija.com/|Linux Mint user group of Serbia]]</nowiki>,
* Craft Exchange prominent Belgrade HackLab as well, My plan is to expand further collaboration and spread the free software love. 

==== Dialogue with institutions my mission ====

Our team is devoted to expanding FLOSS software usage, both in society and civil institutions; therefore, we consider dialogues with institutions representatives to be an important part of process. During last two years, major steps have been taken in that direction, and dialogue with following institutions has been established:
 

* <nowiki>[[http://www.digitalnaagenda.gov.rs/|Ministry of Telecommunications and Digital Development]]</nowiki>,

* <nowiki>[[http://www.poverenik.org.rs/|Commissioner  for Information of Public Importance and Personal Data Protection  Office]]</nowiki>,

* <nowiki>[[http://www.ombudsman.rs/|Ombudsman of the Republic of Serbia]]</nowiki>,

* <nowiki>[[http://www.erazvoj.com/|E-development – association devoted to digital development]]</nowiki>,

  Commissioner  for Information of Public Importance and Personal Data Protection  Office is the first institution in Serbia that expressed interest and intention to switch completely to FLOSS software and Ubuntu. For this purpose, the team is preparing and adapting additional applications, and this project is considered to be strategic in establishing precedent in Serbia. 
I`m proud to be part of dialogue.
 
 
==== Education support ====
* On my iniative team expressed interest in supporting schools in tree Belgrade Municipalities (Vracar, Stari Grad and Rakovica) where elementary schools students use Edubuntu based programs. We plan to set up the infrastructure to help them coordinate and improve skills, both of teachers and students. We have the opportunity to participate in program as a official software support.  

'''Facts:'''
* Rakovica municipality – 2104 computers in 14 schools
* Vracar municipality – 2017 computers in 11 schools
* Stari grad municipality – 617 computers in 7 schools
* Edubuntu 12.04. - 100% localized
We  upgrade computers to Edubuntu 12.04 LTS in May; for that purpose, LoCo members are translated additional applications, and customize Edubuntu as well.

=== Testimonials ===

I had the honor to meet Ladislav in person which gives me a freedom to speak about him as my close associate. 
It is impossible to ignore his enthusiasm and energy. He is a great speaker. His lectures are full of useful information and knowledge, as well as sincere desire to make free software closer to as many users as possible. Lectures, he held troughout Serbia about Ubuntu, has the result of providing this software in schools. Most of those schools are private, but it's a start.
There аre no events provided by Serbian free software communities in the absence of Ubuntu Serbia LoCo. 
All of these and many many more thanks to Ladislav Urošević. <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ivaaivaa|ivaaivaa]]</nowiki>

Uros is devoted member of Serbian ubuntu community. He helped me a lot when I decided to try ubuntu. His enthusiasm is, for me and many others, main reason for trying ubuntu, and keeping it as main operation system.
<nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~faba1973|aleksandarz]]</nowiki>

Uros is highly active with Serbia LoCo  through giving support and participating in live events and  enthusiastically evangelizes the community. Though he is one of the oldest members of team,  he showed a great ability to help others  inside Ubuntu-Serbia community, whether through giving support, helping  others to migrate and spreading the word. <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~nihil-enochian|nihil-enochian]]</nowiki>

Uros is kind and noble sir that is responsible for my journey through the Linux universe. Has not been for him I would still pedal through the W slime with tears pouring from my sinful eyes. But no, he stumbled upon my cry for help with Ubuntu 9.04 and - get this - he harassed me over the IM in order to provide me with ever needed assistance. When I was at my lowest and my enthusiasm was nowhere in sight he injected open source substitute of corporate monsters manufactured shot of adrenalin in my heart and lifted me and my reborn OS to new heights where I flew free on floss winds. And I am still in the air. So, please, Very Respectful People That Make Decisions, give this fine gentleman whichever honors he is candidate for, because as he dealt with me he deals with every soul that encounters his path of righteousness. He deserves it, if anyone does.

Uroš is great guy, and spiritus movens of Serbian LoCo. His personal initiative helped us lot times. Biggest contribution of his to our LoCo was when he negotiated new hosting to us. I personaly think that this cpable and devouldted man could help a lot to ubunt. Напред, Уроше. <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~dalibor|dalibor]]</nowiki> 

Ladislav (uros) is my very good friend and the great Ubuntu and open source enthusiast. We share the same principles and fighting the same battle for freedom. He is also a key member of ubuntu-rs LoCo team. I had the honor to organise one of the best Ubuntu presentations, in Kula in 2010. Ladislav played the key role on that event. Our community is giving him full support. He definitely deserves this position. <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~bane-grbic|webmasteryoda]]</nowiki>

Uros is a very dedicated person and well respected Serbian LoCo member. He invested himself in a promotion of Ubuntu and FLOSS ideas in general. A lot of FLOSS events happened thanks to his devotion and persistence to bring open source software in our region on a big doors. I thank him for all the help throughout these years and support since I decided to check in FLOSS waters and Ubuntu as part of it.
