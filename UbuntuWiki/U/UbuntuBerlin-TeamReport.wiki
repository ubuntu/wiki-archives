== Ubuntu Berlin Reporting Page ==

Welcome to the Ubuntu Berlin reporting page. Every month this page should be filled with bullet points indicating the summary of some of the work you have been working on. As you work on something, try to summarise it here. A few guidelines for how to write good points here:

* Keep it simple and short - single sentences are best. :)
* Try to summarise your work and not be over-detailed - we don't need to know specifics, just a summary of the kind of work involved
* Where possible, include relevant links.

You should get all your reporting included here by the '''22nd''' of every month.

=== The Report ===

* Berlin participated in the UbuntuGlobalJam - we had around 10-15 participants, testing Ubuntu Beta, filing and triaging bugs and even fixing a few. `libjs-dojo` was packaged for the NGO team effort.
