=== In the Press ===

==== Ads may be coming to KDE, the popular Linux desktop ====

Dean Howell, of Neowin, reports that Qt has announced "support for ads in client-side applications". We are given an example of what this could mean, though it's added that KDE users are unlikely to see adverts in KDE's core applications. However, Dean notes it's possible for distributions to use it for monetizing their work. We are told of other users of Qt (Blackberry with QNX) that may make use of this support for ads.
