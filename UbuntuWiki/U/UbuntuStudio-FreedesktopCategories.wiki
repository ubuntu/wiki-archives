== Freedesktop Categories ==

One of the main features of Ubuntu Studio is how we categorize software. Currently (2013) we are doing this in a custom fashion in our XFCE menu, but that doesn't help the rest of the Linux multimedia community, as not everyone are on XFCE, or even on Ubuntu. So, the answer to that problem is that we work on creating new standards for multimedia specific categories in the freedesktop registered categories <nowiki>[[http://standards.freedesktop.org/menu-spec/latest/apa.html]]</nowiki>.

The following tables show the Freedesktop Categories that fit with the Ubuntu Studio workflow categories, and also contain a little description to help categorise the Ubuntu Studio default applications. As the categories listed in a ".desktop" file determine the menu the application is desplayed in, the number of Additional Categories for an application needs to be limited to prevent the same application appearing in many menus.

=== Audio Category ===

In the freedesktop category standard, it is stated that any desktop file with the category Audio must also include the category AudioVideo.

Some of these are duplicates of what exist in the Video category. What separates them should be that something that is strictly Audio should also have the AudioVideo category, but not have the Video category, and vice versa.
