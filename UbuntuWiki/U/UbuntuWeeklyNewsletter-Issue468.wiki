==== Kubuntu: Plasma 5.6.4 available in 16.04 Backports ====

The Kubuntu team announces the availability of Plasma 5.6.4 in the backports PA. Plasma 5.6 was released in March with many feature refinements and new modules to complete the desktop experience. Here you can find instructions on how to obtain the latest release.

==== Ubuntu App Developer Blog: Can I haz MainView in a Window? ====

Zoltán Balogh for the App Developer blog writes that “apps are currently advised to use a Main``View as the root item, which can have a width and a height used as the window dimensions in a windowed environment - on phones and tablets by default all apps are always full screen.” He goes on to say that as soon as users resize the window, some apps may no longer look great. Qt``Quick.Window solves this by providing minimum/maximum/Width/Height properties. This article describes how to utilize this function.

http://developer.ubuntu.com/en/blog/2016/05/30/can-i-haz-mainview-window-post/

==== Sebastian Kügler: Multiscreen in Plasma 5.7 and beyond ====

Sebastian Kügler provides information about the status in Multiscreen in Plasma 5.7. He shares that even though there are problems with restoring previously set up configurations, and around the primary display mechanism, they are currently working on fixes. As they put it, it’s the stuff nightmares are made of. “Multiscreen support requires many different components to play in tune with each other, and they’re usually divided into separate processes communicating via different channels with each other.” A fix is in the works.

==== Verdict and 10 things to know about Ubuntu bq Aquaris M10 ====

This article, by JC Torres for SlashGear, discusses and summarizes the Ubuntu Touch platform. “The bq Aquaris M10 is a promising start to a new kind of convergent computing but is hampered by decent but mediocre hardware and work-in-progress software,” says Torres. “Mobile devices, especially smartphones, are becoming more powerful every year and are practically taking over our computing lives.” He concurs that Ubuntu Touch is a convergence device.

==== It Will Soon Be Possible to Deliver Many Popular Games as Snaps for Ubuntu 16.04 ====

Marius Nestor, of Softpedia, writes that “Canonical's Zygmunt Krynicki and Michael Vogt have announced the debut of snapd 2.0.5, the fifth maintenance release in the stable 2.0 series of the Snappy daemon for Ubuntu Linux.” snapd 2.0.5 is not a notable release, but it improves the Snap integration for the Unity 7 desktop environment on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial Xerus) in the way that it adds more support for Free``Desktop, KDE, and D-Bus Menu notifications. He writes that by and large, there are the obvious enhancements that should make the Snappy experience much better.
