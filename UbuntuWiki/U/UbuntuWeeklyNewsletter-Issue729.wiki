==== Ubuntu 22.04 Testing Week ====

Britt Yazel tells us Ubuntu and flavors will be participating in a Ubuntu Testing Week from March 31st to April 6th, 2022. We are invited to download a daily ISO and give it a test, recording the result on the ISO tracker. We are provided with links to watch Alan Pope do it via some youtube video links. We are also given some quotes from the Ubuntu Podcast on testing, and told it's a "great way to begin contributing to Ubuntu".

==== The Keys to Successful Bug Reporting ====

Britt Yazel writes that bug reporting is a key component of successful open source projects. We are told this article is based on an interview with Ubuntu "extraordinaire" Sebastien Bacher, and covers the basics "in writing concise and effective bug reports". We are reminded it's a person who reads the reports, thus they should be clear, and contain only the required information. We are given an example of a good report, with some reminders of what to avoid. Additionally, we are given some clues on seeking help, and told of some tools used to file bugs.

==== ‘Extension Manager’ GNOME App Adds New Features, New Icon ====

Joey Sneddon informs us that a new update (0.3) to the Extension Manager app has rolled out on Flathub. Joey highlights the change in the icon, notes it lets you read user reviews - including star ratings, and that it lets you install extensions that don't match your version of GNOME Shell too. A special note is that it will bypass current issues with the snapped version of firefox included with Ubuntu 21.10 and later.
