=== General Community News ===

==== Ubuntu 11.04 (Natty Narwhal) reaches end-of-life on October 28, 2012 ====

Kate Stewart of Canonical reminds the community that support for Ubuntu 11.04 will end on October 28, 2012 and that Ubuntu 11.10 continues to be “actively supported with security updates and
select high-impact bug fixes.” Stewart therefore recommends using the “supported path from Ubuntu 11.04 to Ubuntu 11.10.” Instructions for the upgrade are available at the following link: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OneiricUpgrades

https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-announce/2012-September/000162.html

==== Ubuntu Open Week for Quantal: Call for Instructors ====

José Antonio Rey announces Ubuntu Open Week for Quantal to be held from October 24th-26th and puts out a call for instructors who are willing to participate. Anyone interested can contact José Antonio Rey (JoseeAntonioR on #ubuntu-classroom-backstage on freenode, joseeantonior at ubuntu dot com) or Philip Ballew (philballew on ubuntu-classroom-backstage on freenode, philipballew at ubuntu dot com).

Open Week will last for three days; the first two days will consist of IRC sessions, and the third day will be dedicated to Ubuntu On Air! sessions. More information about Ubuntu Open Week can be found at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuOpenWeek

==== Quetzal is taking flight & update on Ubuntu secure boot plans ====

Jon Melamut of Canonical discusses changes in the support for secure boot. Melamut explains that Canonical’s first decision was EFILinux boot loader, but then had an opportunity to discuss the GRUB 2 licensing concerns with the Free Software Foundation. Following this meeting with the FSF, Canonical felt their concerns were addressed, and the decision was made stay with GRUB 2 ,which will be used in Ubuntu 12.04.2 and Ubuntu 12.10 by default.

==== Quantal Quetzal 12.10 Beta Freeze now in effect ====

Kate Stewart of Canonical reminds Ubuntu developers that the Beta freeze for Quantal Quetzal is in effect. Stewart highlights that if there are any urgent bugs to be fixed, developers should tag them with rls-q-incoming tag. Also, Stewart reminds developers to check their blueprints, and to submit any information to be added to the technical overview for Beta 2.

==== Amazon search results in the Dash ====

Mark Shuttleworth discusses the recent change to the Unity Dash for the development version of 12.10, to display search results from Amazon, writing that it “makes perfect sense to integrate Amazon search results in the Dash, because the Home Lens of the Dash should let you find *anything* anywhere. Over time, we’ll make the Dash smarter and smarter, so you can just ask for whatever you want, and it will Just Work.”

Shuttleworth goes on to respond to some of the main questions and comments from people since this change made it into the 12.10 release, including “Why are you putting ads in Ubuntu?” “I want to control what is searched on the Home Lens” and “This is just a moneymaking scheme.”

http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/1182

Olli Ries, a Director of Technology at Canonical, writes about the change in this mailing list post: https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2012-September/035905.html

==== Desktop Linux: Has Ubuntu's Unity Surpassed the Mac? ====

Bruce Byfield of Datamation leads us through Ubuntu’s journey from 2008 when “Mark Shuttleworth, the founder of Ubuntu and Canonical, challenged the crowd at OSCON with the following question: Can we not only emulate, but can we blow right past Apple?" through today. 

Byfield also includes Ubuntu vs. Mac comparison:

* Launcher vs. Dash
* Ubuntu Dash vs. OS X Finder / Spotlight

Byfield concludes: ”If you value an interface for its configuration options and its ability to meet the needs of users with varying degrees of experience, then you are more likely to conclude that Unity still has a ways to go before it can match much less overtake OS X.”
