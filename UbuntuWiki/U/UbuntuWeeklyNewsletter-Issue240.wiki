==== Ubuntu Community mourns the loss of André Gondim ====

The Ubuntu Project has lost an active member of its community. André Gondim died on 3rd November after fighting with ill health for several months.

André was a major contributor of Ubuntu Brazil, the leader of the Brazilian Translations team and member of the Brazilian Community Council. He was 29 years old and married. Even despite his poor health condition, he was always there to support Ubuntu and the community.

The Ubuntu Project honours his excellent work and strong dedication to Ubuntu and the broader Open Source community. André was always there for others as a friend. He will be sorely missed and his dedication and contributions will serve as inspiration to us all.

Our thoughts are with his wife, his family and friends.

=== LoCo News ===

==== Darcy Casselman: Ubuntu LoCo Teams and the 200 Million ====

With the 200 million mark that was presented at UDS-O a few months back, Lo``Co teams need to work as hard as they can to help spread Ubuntu to the masses of people. Darcy suggestions ways in which Lo``Co teams can help reach this goal.

==== Recognising City Teams ====

Darcy Casselman discusses the current policy of regional rather than city teams and suggests a structure in which we officially recognise the regional teams and offer city team leaders atonomy within each Lo``Co team. Lo``Cos can easily do this themselves without any change in general policy.
