==== Jaunty Jackalope Alpha 6 released ====

Announcing the release of Jaunty Jackalope Alpha-6, which will in time become Ubuntu 9.04. Alpha 6 is the sixth in a series of milestone CD images that will be released throughout the Jaunty development cycle.  The Alpha images are known to be reasonably free of show-stoppers CD build or installer bugs, while representing a very recent snapshot of Jaunty. You can download it here:

* Ubuntu Desktop, Server, Netbook Remix, & MID: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/jaunty/alpha-6/
* Ubuntu Education Edition: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/edubuntu/releases/jaunty/alpha-6/
* Kubuntu: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/releases/jaunty/alpha-6/
* Xubuntu: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/xubuntu/releases/jaunty/alpha-6/
* Ubuntu Studio: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntustudio/releases/jaunty/alpha-6/
* Mythbuntu: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/mythbuntu/releases/jaunty/alpha-6/

Pre-releases of Jaunty are *not* encouraged for anyone needing a stable system or anyone who is not comfortable running into occasional, even frequent breakage.  They are, however, recommended for Ubuntu developers and those who want to help in testing, reporting, and fixing bugs.

==== Ubuntu Testing Day: Notify-OSD ====

Ubuntu Testing Day will be next Monday, March 16th. Ubuntu Testing day is a special day where the Ubuntu Community comes together with a shared goal of testing a specific set of ISO images (Alpha, Beta, RC, Gold or Point releases), a specific feature, or bugs needing verification. Taking the idea from the Ubuntu Bug Day, Ubuntu Testing Day will apply the same concepts to ISO testing.

The goal for this testing day will be testing a cool new feature in Jaunty: the new notification system. This is a complete new feature in Ubuntu, so it can be fun to play with it, and find bugs no one else has found before! Please, visit the wiki page for more information and test cases to drive your testing efforts. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/UbuntuTestingDay/20090316

Who can join the Testing Day? Everyone! You don't need to be a developer, or know how to code. Everyone is welcome. If you don't know how to help, then just stop by #ubuntu-testing, and they'll explain everything to you. One of the objectives of Testing Day is to help people get started learning, and testing Ubuntu.

Where to join the Testing Day? Come to #ubuntu-testing on freenode IRC. The team will be there day and night resolving any testing questions you might have. For this particular Testing Day, you can ping eeejay and Mac``Slow to ask for help. Drop in for Ubuntu Testing Day and help make Ubuntu even better!

=== LoCo News ===

==== Ubuntu Florida Rocks Florida Linux Show ====

The Florida Linux Show was held on March 9th, and Ubuntu Florida took pictures and named names.  The Lo``Co Team was there to help promote Linux to individuals and businesses in the area.  In addition to attending the informative talks, they handed out CDs, brought new people to the Lo``Co and area LUGs, and had an all-around great time. See the team picture here: http://www.ubuntu-fl.org/images/stories/fls_fl-loco_edited.jpg

=== Launchpad News ===

==== gmail filters for bug email ====

What does you do when you deal with bugs on Launchpad and get the emails about them through gmail? Grouping a large amount of mail in one folder is problematic at best. The author of the Launchpad blog found a solution. He created filters to automatically sort those emails into folders, making it easier to search through them and follow up. His extensive tutorial may even be applicable to other situations, but it certainly is a solution to the problem he faced. See how he solved the problem at the link.

==== Inside Launchpad AJAX sprint ====

Recently ten people from Launchpad and other parts of Canonical came together in Berlin to hack on Launchpad’s new YUI 3 Java``Script interface.  The sprint was tremendously successful, producing four fully functioning YUI 3 Widgets, complete with test suites, and live demo pages. Here is a brief summary.

* The morning of day one kicked off with a walk through some video proof-of-concepts that they would bring to life.  At the end of the day eight of the sprinters split into pairs, each pair picking a widget to work on.
* Day two saw the four teams plan their attack, then dive into the code.
* Day three saw more code, tests, and their first working widget.
* By noon of day four most of the remaining widgets were functional, if not fully styled. Day four’s afternoon was spent in a team review of the fully functional fancy Overlay widget.
* Everyone had great momentum going into day five.  All four widgets were fully functional, with only a few rough spots remaining.  Day five’s afternoon was spent with everyone in a Review Jam.

==== Canonical QA Desktop Automation Sprint ====

Various representatives of Canonical QA gathered in Oxford to collaborate on automating the Ubuntu desktop testing effort. Some of the areas discussed were tools, team collaboration, best practices, and roadblocks. cgregan, the author of the Open Source QA blog, discusses Desktop Automation, particularly with respect to the efforts of the Canonical QA team. "Testing automation is a key process in the testing efforts. It could simplify testers' lives by automating things that are repeatable and leaving human effort to things that cannot be automated by a machine, like usability bugs." --

Automation wiki - Get involved: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/Automation

==== Ubuntu Women project status ====

The Ubuntu Women project, held a meeting on March 4th discussing the current state of projects and future goals. During the meeting they did some brainstorming and came up with a few ideas:

* Provide more encouragement to women to speak at events and be visible within the project
* Launch a “Women Behind Ubuntu” interview series for inclusion in Full Circle Magazine and on our wiki
* Revitalize the website

From the minutes of the meeting, the Ubuntu Women are genuinely and heavily involved with many projects within the Ubuntu Community, and have great ideas for what should be acted upon in the future.

==== Ubuntu 9.10 sees the cloud above the trees ====

Next month Ubuntu 9.04, Jaunty Jackalope, hits an FTP or torrent site near you. With its features set frozen, the masterminds at Canonical are looking to the future. Ubuntu 9.10 is already being touted as "cloud-centric," with aims to keep it at the forefront of cloud computing. The cloud storage space can be used for backing up data, but the more visionary approach is that applications can be deployed to the cloud. You can construct applications for others to use, and you can make applications available no matter where you are working on the Internet. Ultimately, Ubuntu wants to make the Amazon cloud as straightforward as their existing Ubuntu package management tool for loading new apps onto your hard drive. http://www.itwire.com/content/view/23719/1141/

==== French police: we saved millions of euros by adopting Ubuntu ====

ars technica's Ryan Paul tells us that France's Gendarmerie Nationale, the country's national police force, has saved millions of dollars by migrating its desktop software infrastructure away from Microsoft Windows, and replacing it with the Ubuntu Linux distribution. The Gendarmerie began its transition to open source software in 2005 when it replaced Microsoft Office with Open``Office.org across the entire organization. It gradually adopted other open source software applications, including Firefox and Thunderbird. After the launch of Windows Vista in 2006, it decided to phase out Windows and incrementally migrate to Ubuntu. At the current stage of the migration, it has adopted Ubuntu on 5,000 workstations and based on the success of this pilot migration, it plans to move forward and switch a total of 15,000 workstations to Ubuntu by the end of the year. It aims to have the entire organization, and all 90,000 of its workstations, running the Ubuntu distribution by 2015. http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2009/03/french-police-saves-millions-of-euros-by-adopting-ubuntu.ars

==== Dvorak discovers Linux (Ubuntu) ====

Henry Kingman, writing for Desktop``Linux.com, notes that John Dvorak will install Ubuntu 8.10 permanently on his latest machines.  Dvorak has shied away from it before, due to hardware issues.  But now, the Live``CD feature allows him to test his hardware first.  Dvorak adds, "The critical mass has been reached, and it's time everyone tried Ubuntu."  Some of his interest in Linux stemmed from his experiences with Windows.  Those interested in what else appealed to Dvorak can get more information at his editorial for PCMag.com. http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2342703,00.asp

==== 15 free downloads to pep up your old PC ====

Preston Gralla of Computerworld lists 15 free downloads that can breathe new life into an old PC, and one of his suggestions is Ubuntu. "Frustrated with your old operating system but don't want to spend the money to get a new one? No problem." He suggests using Wubi which installs Ubuntu as a dual-boot option on your PC for free. Preston goes on to say that if you haven't installed Linux before, you'll be quite surprised at how peppy it is. It has lower hardware requirements than Windows, which makes it quite fast, even on an older PC. There's also plenty of free software available in the repositories, and it ships with a good deal of free software, including the office suite Open``Office.org. http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&taxonomyName=Software&articleId=9129351&taxonomyId=18&pageNumber=7

=== In The Blogosphere ===

==== RightScale Puts Ubuntu Server In the Cloud, Too ====

Joe Panettieri of Works``With``U reports that the Ubuntu Server revolution is starting, but it doesn’t involve traditional on-premise systems. Right``Scale, a well-known cloud computing company, today announced “full support” for Ubuntu as part of the Right``Scale Cloud Management platform. It’s big news, and here's why: "The Ubuntu software development community can now use Right``Scale to easily deploy and manage cloud applications on cloud infrastructures such as Amazon EC2 with complete control and portability." About six months ago, Panettieri assumed Windows Server and Red Hat Enterprise Linux would dominate Amazon’s Elastic Compute Cloud. But moves by Right``Scale, Turnkey Linux and Canonical itself suggest that Ubuntu Server Edition has a strong chance to become a dominant application server on multiple cloud platforms. http://www.workswithu.com/2009/03/12/rightscale-puts-ubuntu-server-in-the-cloud-too/

==== 12 Ubuntu Server Appliances Meet the Cloud ====

Joe Panettieri of Works``With``U says that Ubuntu is converging quickly with cloud services. A prime example: Turnkey Linux is launching 12 Ubuntu Server Edition software appliances that users can deploy in various cloud services. The news comes only a few weeks after Canonical said Ubuntu 9.10 will leap into Amazon.com’s cloud. Initial server appliances from Turnkey Linux support the LAMP stack, Ruby on Rails, Drupal CMS, Joomla CMS, Media``Wiki, Django framework, MySQL and PostgreSQL database engines, and LAPP. Turnkey Linux's press release also stated that appliances for Apache Tomcat, Wordpress, Moodle, Movable Type and phpBB are currently under-going private testing before a public release. Panettieri says he's certainly intrigued by Ubuntu and software appliances heading into the cloud. http://www.workswithu.com/2009/03/12/12-ubuntu-server-appliances-meet-the-cloud/

==== Possible data loss in Ext4 ====

A bug report posted in Launchpad bug tracker for the next version of Ubuntu 9.04 (Jaunty Jackalope) describes a massive data loss problem when using Ext4. The report describes a crash occurring shortly after the KDE 4 desktop files had been loaded. Developer Ted Ts'o explains the background of the problem. Like other modern file systems, such as XFS, Ext4 implements delayed allocation – writing new data can take up to 60 seconds. This increases the performance and allows for optimization of the data organization on the hard drive platter. Ts'o says that the application should be fixed so it does not write and rewrite small files. He advises that "this is really more of an application design problem more than anything else." http://www.h-online.com/open/Possible-data-loss-in-Ext4--/news/112821

==== Testing Ubuntu Jaunty and Ext4 WITHOUT Trashing Your Data ====

Scott Wegner reports that Ubuntu 9.04 “Jaunty Jackalope” is set for release in less than two months, and is currently in the “Alpha 6″ testing stage. Arguably, the hottest new feature is stable support for Linux’s new file system, ext4. The new file system has been shown to have significant performance gains over any other Linux file system to date. But think twice before you upgrade to ext4, as many users have been reporting considerable data loss. It manifests itself after a system crash, where open files will simply be emptied and erased. It is particularly prevalent in users’ settings files, such as those used for GNOME or KDE. Fortunately, the cause of the bug is relatively well-known. http://www.automaticable.com/2009-03-12/testing-ubuntu-jaunty-and-ext4-without-trashing-your-data/

==== Ubuntu for Business: The Missing Pieces ====

A blogger from Works With U points out several things that Ubuntu is missing to compete well with Microsoft in the business market. They are email access, word processor, spreadsheet, and the ability to collaborate by having access to shared documents all within a secure framework to prevent any unauthorized access or malicious activity. He points out that a Windows Server/Desktop solution is the only one that can currently satisfy all of these functions. When he compares this to Ubuntu, there is Open``Office. This gives the word processor and spreadsheet applications. The only functionality, that he says is missing, is an email server linked to a centralized user authentication system. This is available with Ubuntu, but not without going through some tedious setup. This blogger says that the one thing that Ubuntu needs to do to make it a great solution for businesses, is to gain integrated directory and email services. http://www.workswithu.com/2009/03/08/ubuntu-for-business-the-missing-pieces/

==== Five things Ubuntu really needs ====

Blogger Darren Yates goes over some of the "bigger-picture" things that he believes Ubuntu, and Linux in general could use help with. The first suggestion is "More encouragement for beginners." Darren would really like to see experienced Linux users feeding their vast knowledge back to the community, and helping people who have just started with Linux. The next suggestion he gives is "Better support from big name brands." The US and the UK have pretty good support already, but Darren Yates is from Australia where this support is not nearly as good. The third suggestion that he has is "better netbook/notebook support." This is coming with 9.04, but netbooks have been out for 18 months now, and it has taken Ubuntu this long to get serious about them. The last suggestion that he has is "More supporters introducing it to their friends." He finishes by saying that more than anything, people have been saying, Linux needs people showing it to their friends and family. http://darrenyates.com.au/?p=918

=== Meeting Summaries ===

==== Server Team Meeting: March 10th ====

The Server Team meeting minutes can be found online with the irc logs here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MeetingLogs/Server/20090310

* Samba Bug Day: mathiaz reminded that next Thursday is dedicated to triaging samba bugs. Ubuntu Server members are welcomed to join the effort and invited to join #ubuntu-bugs to give a hand to bug triagers.

* Postfix and Dovecot integration: ivoks wrote a blog post about the dovecot/postfix integration. mathiaz mentioned bug 339966 reported by a user that had an existing working dovecot server, and installed the dovecot-postfix package, resulting in a broken system.

* Exchange support for Evolution: ivoks made some tests with the new evolution-mapi plugin. Although the openchange mapi clients are working evolution is unable to connect to the exchange server. ivoks is not sure what the problem is - further debugging is required.

* Support for likewise-open krb5 patch: mathiaz gave an update on the likewise-open patch he had applied to the krb5 package in Jaunty. One of the Debian maintainer contacted him to inquire about the future of this patch. The upcoming version of MIT kerberos, 1.7, includes a different implementation of the GSS service than the one provided by the likewise-open patch. Implementations are API incompatible. The Debian maintainer suggested to rework the patch to not change the public header and include the types and prototypes in the likewise package instead.

* Planet ubuntuserver: dantalizing mentioned he started to aggregate Ubuntu Server related blogs on The Completely Unofficial Ubuntu Server Planet. http://ubuntuserver.org/

* KVM backport in hardy: kirkland announced he had backported the userspace part of KVM 84 to hardy. Packages are available in the ubuntu-virt team PPA. Anyone having long-standing issues with kvm-62 on hardy should try that package and let the Ubuntu Server team know how it works in #ubuntu-virt. https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-virt/+archive/ppa

* QEMU 0.10.0 in Jaunty: kirkland reported that a new version of qemu (0.10.0) had been released upstream. He plans to push it to jaunty if the Feature Freeze Exception is accepted by the MOTU release team.

The next Server Team meeting will be on Tuesday, March 17th at 15:00 UTC in #ubuntu-meeting.

==== US Teams Meeting: March 5th ====

* Planet

** Do we want the US Planet to include unapproved teams?

** The official stance is that unapproved teams should not have websites
** The reality is that many unapproved teams have websites
** We found no reason that unapproved teams should not be allowed to participate in the planet if they have a site, but we should uphold the official stance (share your feed if you have one, but we won't encourage unapproved teams to make sites to participate)

** We now have access to the planet, pleia2 will be working on making the template more US-oriented

* Website

** johnc4510 volunteered to work on the Drupal site that Canonical is hosting as a Mentor he will be given Administrative access
** MTecknology and Yasumoto also offered up their expertise
** At the time of writing, it was decided to stick with Canonical hosting unless a reason to look for hosting elsewhere is uncovered
** Content?
** Will we aggregate news? Who would write news? Should planet be news? Undecided.
** For now we will keep current content, and expand upon it as time, ideas and initiative dictate

* Mentors

** John Crawford(johnc4510) of the US-AZ Lo``Co was approved as a mentor: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/JohnCrawford
** Dan Trevino(dantalizing) of the US-FL Lo``Co was approved as a mentor: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DanTrevino

The US Lo``Co Teams Project is happy to welcome it's new mentors. Plans are moving forward with the current website hosting situation. The planet will continue to be updated with a new theme and more feeds to be added soon.
