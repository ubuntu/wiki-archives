== Introduction ==

The TV team has come around to start brainstorming on the next step in computing, or as Mark Shuttleworth said "Smart Screens". We shall have two areas to focus on. Those are '''hardware''' and '''software'''. We need to figure out on what kind of hardware we will be running our part of the Unity experience on, as well how it should look and behave.

== IRC ==
IRC is a great way for for a global team, like the TV Team, to communicate. In our channel we take care of team business or just get to know each other better. Please read <nowiki>[[IRC-Guidelines]]</nowiki> for channel guidelines.

If you do not have an IRC Client or are brand new to IRC you can quickly and easily sign on to our team channel <nowiki>[[ http:--webchat.freenode.net-?channels=ubuntu-tv | here]]</nowiki>.

== Launchpad ==
We use <nowiki>[[Launchpad|launchpad]]</nowiki> for our team organisation, which included a list of our members and the discussion mailing-list. The team is open for everyone to join and can be found on <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-tv | launchpad.net/~ubuntu-tv]]</nowiki>. On there you can subscribe to the mailing-list.
