==== Canonical Promotes Ubuntu Pro To General Availability ====

Michael Larabel tells us Canonical has released the Ubuntu Pro subscription service. We are reminded it is available for free for up to five systems for personal subscriptions, and includes every LTS release since Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. It includes "further compliance/hardening certifications like around HIPAA and FedRAMP" and can include "optionally backed by 24x7 enterprise grade support". We are given some details of it, including a helpful Canonical provided comparison chart in which support for Universe packages; as well as live patching is depicted.

=== In the Blogosphere ===

==== ‘Damask’ is a New Wallpaper App for Linux Desktops ====

Joey Sneddon reminds us 'scores' of wallpaper downloader apps already exist for Linux desktops, before telling us about another: Damask. We are told this is a GTK4 app that fits in perfectly on modern Ubuntu desktops. We are given a list of sites the app can grab images from. We are told of some of the features and limits within the app, and given a link on Flathub so we can grab a copy.

==== Wine 8.0 Released With PE Conversion Complete, Progress On WoW64 Support ====

==== Ubuntu 23.04 Makes Telegram a Deb-to-Snap Transitional Package ====

Joey Sneddon writes that users of Ubuntu 23.04 who install the 'telegram-desktop' app will now get the snap package, even if installed via apt. We are also told why discussions are taking place that may also do this for older releases of Ubuntu too. We're also told it was Telegram that asked Ubuntu to make this change, with Joey adding that this change makes "sense to me". The snapped version of telegram-desktop is packaged by Telegram FZ-LLC.
