=== Summary ===

On every Launchpad page, Launchpad''''''Menus will provide a "Bugs" link taking you to the Malone page for the current context (person, distribution, project, product, source package, or Launchpad as a whole). The design of the page is much the same for each context: a search form for finding bug reports involving that entity, lists of recently reported and random unresolved bugs, and (if you are logged in) bug reports you were recently involved in for that context.
