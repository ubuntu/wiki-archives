==== No! Ubuntu is NOT Replacing Apt with Snap ====

Abhishek Prakash writes that he regularly sees rumours that Ubuntu is planning to replace Apt with Snap in Ubuntu 19.04, and that this is just not true. Abhishek provides some context and the original source for the rumor, and how it gained some 'heat'. Then we are advised of accurate clarification in this rumor’s dismissal as merely a proposal by some community member not affiliated with Ubuntu. Alan Pope of Canonical confirms the fact stating “not a thing we're doing”.
