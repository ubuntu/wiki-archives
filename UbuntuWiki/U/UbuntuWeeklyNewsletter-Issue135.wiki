==== Ubuntu 9.04 Beta Released ====

The Ubuntu team is pleased to announce the beta release of Ubuntu 9.04 Desktop and Server editions. Codenamed "Jaunty Jackalope", 9.04 continues Ubuntu's proud tradition of integrating the latest and greatest open source technologies into a high-quality, easy-to-use Linux distribution.

* Ubuntu 9.04 Desktop Edition brings faster boot speeds and a new notification system to your everyday computing experience.

* Ubuntu 9.04 Server Edition makes it easy to experiment with cloud computing using Eucalyptus on your own servers, and sports an improved mail server integration stack based on postfix and dovecot.

* The Ubuntu 9.04 family of variants, Kubuntu, Xubuntu, Ubuntu Studio, and Mythbuntu, also reach beta status today.

This is a Beta, so there may be some bugs. If you find one, please report it to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ReportingBugs rather than using the traditional Launchpad method.

https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-announce/2009-March/000119.html

==== Jaunty Countdown Banners ====

Help spread the word about Ubuntu.  There are 4 banners available for your website or blog:  The Ring, The Calendar, and a New Animated banner as well as a simple image for those who can't use javascript.   A special thanks goes to the community members who created the graphics, concept and animation:

* Thorsten Wilms (thorwil) for the ring and animation artwork
* Markus Grönholm for the animation javascript
* Mads Rosendahl (MadsRH) for the calendar artwork
* Pierre Buyle for initial animation and concept

For best results: use the exact code listed. It will change as release day approaches so if you copy the file to a different location you won't get the full benefit. The code and examples are at the link below.

==== Ubuntu 7.10 reaches EOL, April 18,2009 ====

Ubuntu announced the release of 7.10 almost 18 months ago, on October 18, 2007.  The support period is now nearing its end and Ubuntu 7.10 will reach end of life on Saturday, April 18, 2009. At that time, Ubuntu Security Notices will no longer include information or updated packages for Ubuntu 7.10.  Note that upgrades to version 8.10 and beyond are only supported in multiple steps, via an upgrade first to 8.04 LTS, then to 8.10.

http://www.ubuntu.com/news/ubuntu-7.10-eol

==== Ubuntu Server-dedicated course: Deploying Ubuntu in the Enterprise Environment ====

Canonical has now launched an Ubuntu Server-dedicated course, called "Deploying Ubuntu in the Enterprise Environment".  This is a 5 day course for intermediate-to-advanced system administrators.  Participants will acquire the skills they need to deploy, configure and maintain Ubuntu Server Edition within an enterprise infrastructure.  Canonical is offering a trial run with an online ‘virtual classroom’ version of the course for two weeks from Monday 4 May 2009. The seating is limit and sold through the Canonical store. The trial is offered at a special price and includes a special guest speaker, Mark Shuttleworth, founder of the Ubuntu Project.

==== QA Team Testing Day: Ubuntu Installers ====

The next Ubuntu Testing Day will be next Monday, March 30th. The QA team will be testing the two main installers in Ubuntu: debian-installer (the installer featured in alternate images) and ubiquity (the installer featured in Live CDs). They are going to test Ubuntu Jaunty Beta ISOs. You don't need to be a developer to test for bugs, everyone is welcome. For help with problems or testing questions, join #ubuntu-testing on irc.freenode.net. You can ping cjwatson for help on testing day.

The Tunisian Lo``Co has recently participated in 2 events.  The first was at the Faculty of Economics and Management of Sfax on March 14, 2009. Four presentations and an install fest were held that day.  The second event was held march 21, 2009 in the Youth Club of Ras El Jebel.  There they gave 2 presentations and a workshop.  This was an opportunity to meet a lot of secondary school students and explain the benefits of Ubuntu.

https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-news-team/2009-March/000467.html

==== Educational Technology Day in New York State ====

The Ubuntu-NY (New York State) Lo``Co participated in an Educational Technology day, held in Ithaca, New York on March 26, 2009.  This is a regional event with major vendors such as Adobe, Apple Computer, Dell, Hewlett Packard, Microsoft and others.  Their booth was right near the entrance, where they had lots of traffic.  Lo``Co members gave presentations on the OLPC (One Laptop Per Child) and saving money with Free Software.  Included at the link are lots of pictures of the event.

https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NewYorkTeam/Events/20090326

The release party with a small cover donation and rsvp will be from 4-6 pm. Check out our event page for more details. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NewYorkTeam/Events/20090425

If the community has any suggestions or successes with public awareness of FOSS and Ubuntu, please let ausimage know. The plans right now include talks and demos, but the exact details have not yet been decided. ausimage has also drafted a new pamphlet that is awaiting trademarks approval and is aimed at basic and casual computer users. http://www.ausimage.us/Blog/20090327

==== Ubuntu LoCo Drupal 6.3.1 released ====

With the coming of Ubuntu 9.04, it was time for a change to this package. Our latest release now has a countdown timer.

You can see available options for countdown images at http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/countdown. Unfortunately, this third option being an iframe means that we're unable to include it as an option.

The options available:
* Pick from 3 for the 4 images
* Set position
* Set size
* Set opacity
* Set visibility
* Even IE tested

You can grab the latest package at https://launchpad.net/ubuntu-drupal-releases/6.x.

=== Launchpad News ===

==== Launchpad down for maintenance April 1st ====

The Launchpad Team has some planned maintenance, and the release of a new version of Launchpad coming up, both of which will mean a short period of down-time. Launchpad will be offline for one hour on April 1st. With this new release, Launchpad 2.2.3, all of Launchpad will be offline for around an hour while they roll-out the new code to their servers.

Going offline: 22.00 UTC April 1st
Expected back: 23.00 UTC April 1st

http://blog.launchpad.net/notifications/launchpad-maintenance-26th-march-and-1st-april

==== Linking project releases in Launchpad to Milestones ====

With the 2.2.3 release of Launchpad — due 1st of April — the team will strengthening the relationship between milestones and releases. https://launchpad.net/launchpad-project/+milestone/2.2.3

* What are Releases, Milestones, and Series: Launchpad hosted projects can arrange their development into Series, which contain Milestones to which bugs can be targeted, and Releases which hold download tarballs and have release notes. Although Milestones and Releases go together, they were previously managed separately in Launchpad. Now they’re more unified.

* Why are they doing this: Many people already use releases and milestones in this way. Milestones aid release planning, and help people understand a project’s goals. Creating a release directly from a milestone implies that the milestone was reached. The goal is to better present the history and future of a project, as well as to improve the workflow for planners.

* What you can do: You do not need to take any action regarding releases. The Launchpad Team will migrating existing releases by linking them to a milestone, or if there isn’t an appropriate milestone, creating a new one. You can use Launchpad’s staging environment — https://staging.launchpad.net/ — right now to check what your releases and milestones will look like under the new system.

The team would value your feedback so they can improve the data migration script. If you come across a problem, please report a bug here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/launchpad For other comments, send them an email at feedback@launchpad.net

=== The Planet ===

==== LinkedIn for Ubuntu Members ====

Ubuntu Planet blogger Michael has been using Linked``In, and he's seen great potential in it for career networking.

Admittedly he saw the "Groups" available and his first instinct was "oh... is this going to be another Facebook with a little Launchpad in it?" He quickly realized that this isn't the case at all. It turns out that the groups are what drives the networking process, and the applications available are just to add to your profile.

Since there was no group for Ubuntu Members, he created one. This will be for Official Ubuntu Members only. If you are a member and have your @ubuntu.com email address setup as your Linked``In account, you can sign up without being approved. Otherwise you will have to meet with him on IRC to verify your status.

If you are an Ubuntu member and are using, or are curious about using Linked``In, take a trip over to the team and see if perhaps you would be interested in joining.http://www.linkedin.com/groups?about=&gid=1867717&trk=anet_ug_grppro

=== The Fridge ===

==== Ubuntu 9.04 Free Culture Showcase Winners ====

This was a competition in which creative types could submit their work for inclusion in the /Examples folder of the next edition of Ubuntu. In this competition there was an expansion of the Audio and Video categories to also include a Graphic/Photo category. The net result was a fantastic range of entries, and many great submissions!

Here are the winners:

* Audio: Jean Franois Marais - Invocation: http://moshang.net/MoShang-Invocation.ogg
* Video: Robbie Ferguson - Spirit Of Ubuntu: http://blip.tv/file/get/Category5-SpiritOfUbuntu595.ogv
* Graphic/Photo: William J Mc``Kee Jr - Canadian Clouds: http://fc30.deviantart.com/fs38/i/2008/334/4/e/Canadian_Clouds_by_m0deth.jpg

Thanks also to Keith Worrell and Endolith for some of the patches and branches involved in the Example Content package. You can read more about each submitter at the link.

http://fridge.ubuntu.com/node/1844

==== The Fridge needs a new theme ====

The Fridge is going to under go some much needed changes, and they are calling on the Ubuntu Community for help creating a new theme. The goal is to go live in time for the Jaunty Jackalope release.

Mock ups will be due Thursday, April 2nd. The Ubuntu News team will select from the submissions, and provide the feedback needed for final polish. You do NOT need to create a full-blown design here, just enough to sell your idea. This is purely a graphic design job, submit your mockups by posting them as attachments in the Phase 1 section of: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Website/FridgeTheme

Here are the requirements:

* Design

** A new visual appearance, harmonious with the ubuntu website but not just another ubuntu knock off
** Stick with the colours and fonts of the ubuntu site but not feel constrained to using the rounded borders with the top right drop down nav
** Attractive, people will feel the site is credible
** A layout that looks like a news website
** Possibly include a special layout for Ubuntu Weekly News, since it is a regular item and has a different format than the other news stories

* Content Types

** News stories
** UWN
** Events

* Blocks - side-bar items

** Popular content
** Syndication/rss
** Events
** Search

Ensuing phases will create HTML/CSS, and a Drupal theme. Some people who are great at making designs may not know how to make drupal themes, and those who can do drupal coding may not be great at design. Lets make this a team effort since there is lots of talent in all the necessary areas.

==== Linux Weekly News Subscription for Ubuntu Members ====

Canonical has announced that it is contributing a new benefit to Ubuntu Membership: a complimentary subscription to Linux Weekly News. Our friends at Debian have been doing this extra for a while now, and Canonical thought this could be an excellent gesture for its Ubuntu Members.

There are currently 459 Ubuntu Members. https://launchpad.net/~ubuntumembers

To enjoy this benefit you need to be a member of the Ubuntu project. You can then switch on your free subscription like this:

* Apply for an account at LWN here: https://lwn.net/newaccount
* Send an email to Rachael at rachael.tripp (at) canonical dot com (preferably using your ubuntu.com address) asking for a subscription sponsorship. This email MUST contain:
** Your LWN username
** Your Launchpad username.
* Rachael will then go and double check you are a member and not telling porkies.
* You will receive an email when the subscription has been accepted and is ready to roll (or read).

Ubuntu Members are the group of people who vote to confirm new appointments to the Ubuntu Community Council. Membership is open to anybody who has made a substantial contribution - of any form - to Ubuntu. For more details about Ubuntu Members, and how to become one, please visit: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership. Our thanks to Canonical and Mark Shuttleworth for adding this extra perk for Ubuntu Membership.

=== In The Press ===

==== Ubuntu planning move to the cloud ====

C``Net's Charles Cooper says we should add Canonical to the roster of companies offering technology to help enterprise customers build their own cloud-computing setups. But unlike most of the better-known players in this nascent market, the twist here is that the technology will be supplied by an open-source shop. Next month the company will offer the first details on plans to roll out cloud-computing services to its customers. At this point, details remain scarce but management isn't planning to reinvent the wheel. Instead, the company is going to adopt the same approach it used to promote Ubuntu as an open-source operating system. http://news.cnet.com/8301-10787_3-10203590-60.html

==== Ubuntu promises DIY Amazon cloud ====

Gavin Clarke of The Register tells us that next month should see the first steps from the Canonical camp that will let you run an Amazon-style cloud behind the firewall on Ubuntu. The Jaunty Jackalope edition of Ubuntu, version 9.04, due in April, will let you take existing Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) from Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and run them on your own Ubuntu servers. The plan with Ubuntu is to target serious business users who like the idea of the cloud, with its virtualized computing resources, but who want to retain control over the servers, the computing cycles, their applications, and their data. Steve George, Canonical's director of support and services, speaking to The Reg at the Open Source Business Conference in San Francisco called Jaunty Jackalope's cloud capability an initial technology release. Full features are planned for Ubuntu 9.10 - called Karmic Koala and expected in October. http://www.channelregister.co.uk/2009/03/25/ubuntu_amazon_cloud/

==== Giving Linux That 'XP' Factor ====

Keir Thomas of PC World says that everybody has a version of Windows that's their favorite. What version it is depends a lot on your age. For most people, XP is their favorite Windows. But pretty soon XP will be a vague memory to most users. "I have a solution for your XP woes.", Thomas says, "I recommend Ubuntu." Thomas thinks that Ubuntu is like a warm pub on a cold night -- inviting and welcoming to everybody. But Ubuntu also has that magical "Windows XP factor" -- it's as functional as you need it to be, yet is still accessible. It 'just works' too -- there's usually no need to install drivers, or add-on software. You install, and go. Everything comes together very nicely. http://www.pcworld.com/article/161958/ubuntu_windows_xp.html

==== As Jaunty Nears, Ubuntu 9.04 Beta Released ====

Michael Larabel of phoronix tells us that while there is about a month to go until the release of Ubuntu 9.04, on March 26th Canonical released the only beta release for this next Ubuntu release known as the Jaunty Jackalope. Among the features in Ubuntu 9.04 are the GNOME 2.26 desktop, Linux 2.6.28 kernel, X Server 1.6, KDE 4.2, and various other updated packages. Ubuntu 9.04 also has a new desktop notification system, improved boot performance, and various other features. http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=NzE3Mg

==== What You Should Expect from Ubuntu 9.04 ====

Daniel Pop-Silaghi of softpedia is sure most of you noticed the abundance of Ubuntu-related news that filled the Linux section last week. It's no surprise though, as Canonical renewed most artwork elements for the upcoming Jaunty Jackalope in that small interval. But new artwork is not even close to everything Ubuntu 9.04 will have to offer. Software-wise, Ubuntu, Kubuntu and Xubuntu 9.04 will come with the latest major releases: GNOME 2.26, KDE 4.2 and Xfce 4.6 desktop environments. Open``Office 3.0.1 will be the default office productivity suite and a system-cleaning tool will be available in the form of Computer Janitor. Ubuntu 9.04 (Jaunty Jackalope) will definitely invade many computers all over the world and further strengthen its loyal community. http://news.softpedia.com/news/Softpedia-Linux-Weekly-Issue-38-107484.shtml#0

==== Everything You Need to Know About Ubuntu 9.04 (Jaunty Jackalope) ====

Will Kraft of Maximum``PC reports that the newest version of Ubuntu (9.04, codenamed “Jaunty Jackalope”) is set to be released on April 23, 2009. While there are some noticeable differences, much of the improvement in 9.10 can be found under the hood. Jaunty comes with GNOME 2.25.92 (in Alpha 5) and many other packages like Open``Office.org 3.0, GIMP 2.6.5, and much more. Jaunty will also include  X server 1.6, which includes new features like X input 1.5, predictable pointer acceleration, and RandR 1.3. Also, Jaunty introduces the “Computer Janitor”, a new administration utility meant to help clean up orphaned packages. Kraft also notes improvements in appearance, the inclusion of EXT4, kernel updates, and speed increase as just some of the many highlights of Ubuntu 9.04. http://www.maximumpc.com/article/features/everything_you_need_know_about_ubuntu_904_jaunty_jackalope

==== Canonical To Not Enable UXA, Too Problematic ====

Michael Larabel of phoronix reports that in August of last year Intel had introduced the UMA Acceleration Architecture (commonly referred to as UXA). UXA is based upon the very common EXA acceleration API but it handles the pixmap management using GEM objects. With its use of the Graphics Execution Manager it's more optimal as more open-source graphics drivers turn to kernel memory management. Bryce Harrington, the lead X.Org engineer at Canonical, has decided these performance improvements do not outweigh Intel's UXA bugs and as a result it will not be enabled by default in Ubuntu 9.04. Bryce shares that some Ubuntu users are able to use UXA without any problems, while others with the same Intel IGPs report serious regressions. He hopes, however, to enable UXA by default on Intel hardware in Ubuntu 9.10. http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=NzE3MQ

==== Goodbye Ubuntu 7.10 - Gutsy Gibbon reaches end of life on April 18th, 2009 ====

Daniel Pop-Silaghi of softpedia looks back to almost eighteen months ago, on the 18th of October 2007, when Canonical announced the release of Ubuntu 7.10, codename Gutsy Gibbon. It was undoubtedly an awesome release, allowing many to make the switch from other operating systems and plunge into the Linux experience without any regret. But as we all know, all good things eventually come to an end, and Ubuntu 7.10 will reach its end of life on April 18th, 2009. This means that starting with April 18th, Canonical will stop "feeding" its Ubuntu 7.10 operating system with security/critical fixes and software updates! Those of you who still use Gutsy and want to upgrade will have to do that incrementally, from Ubuntu 7.10 to Ubuntu 8.04 LTS and from Ubuntu 8.04 LTS to Ubuntu 8.10. Or wait for Ubuntu 9.04 (Jaunty Jackalope) and do a clean install with the new EXT4 filesystem. http://news.softpedia.com/news/Goodbye-Ubuntu-7-10-107519.shtml

=== In The Blogosphere ===

==== Ubuntu Server Edition Training from Mark Shuttleworth ====

Blogger Joe Panettieri from Works With U tells us about Canonical's plan to launch an online training course for Ubuntu Server Edition on May 4th. "The virtual classroom will include a special guest speaker: Canonical CEO Mark Shuttleworth." Face-to-face training sessions will also be starting in June. Joe adds that this is another of the pushes that the Ubuntu server Edition has made recently, including: Right``Scale and Turnkey Linux, promoting Ubuntu server applications in various clouds. Canonical is piecing together a directory services strategy to help Ubuntu Server Edition compete more effectively against Windows Server and Active Directory. With Unison Technologies launching a unified communications system on Ubuntu, Plans for HP to certify Ubuntu on Pro``Liant servers, and a Canonical user survey highlighting Ubuntu Server Edition's continued momentum. http://www.workswithu.com/2009/03/24/ubuntu-server-edition-training-from-mark-shuttleworth/

==== Top 10 Tools for a Free Online Education ====

Kevin Purdy of lifehacker says it's easy to forget these days that the internet started out as a place for academics and researchers to trade data and knowledge. Recapture the web's brain-expanding potential with these free resources for educating yourself online. One of the things Purdy thinks people should do is learn to actually use Ubuntu. With a brand-new installation sitting on your computer, few resources are as straight-forward and comprehensive as the Ubuntu Guide, which is packed with common stuff like installing VLC and getting VLC playback, but spans across topics including Samba and remote printing configuration. Author Keir Thomas also offered Lifehacker readers a little preview of his Ubuntu Kung Fu in two excerpts that tweak one's system into a faster, more efficient data flinger. http://lifehacker.com/5188342/top-10-tools-for-a-free-online-education

==== First Look at Ubuntu 9.04 "Jaunty Jackalope" Beta ====

Kevin Purdy of lifehacker thinks the name's ridiculous, but notes that "Jaunty Jackalope," the next release of the popular Linux distribution Ubuntu, is seriously focused on the user experience. lifehacker has covered bits and pieces of what's coming up for Ubuntu 9.04 in the past few months, but one feature they couldn't show with screenshots was the improved boot time in Jaunty. Purdy says, "Having lived in it for about a week and installed a few apps, it took 24.9 seconds from choosing my OS to boot in Grub to a login window, and about 19 seconds more to get to a fully-loaded desktop (about 43 total)." http://lifehacker.com/5180833/first-look-at-ubuntu-904-jaunty-jackalope-beta

==== Ubuntu Keeps Getting Better - Is There A Limit? ====

Every six months without fail, a new release of Ubuntu arrives, carrying a number of new features. How long can this last, though? Certainly there are a lot of great features that could be implemented, but projects of Ubuntu’s size have to start worrying about feature creep, or the tendency to introduce too many features, making the product less useful and too complex. While this may not be an issue that Ubuntu runs into for at least a few more years, it is something that almost every piece of software must eventually deal with. Hopefully Ubuntu will continue to introduce only useful, important features and not stray into bloat land. http://www.linuxloop.com/news/2009/03/26/ubuntu-keeps-getting-better-is-there-a-limit/
