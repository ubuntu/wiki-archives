==== Karmic UNR packages now open for translation ====

Karmic Ubuntu Netbook Remix (UNR) packages are now open for translation. You can start translating them straight away from here: https://translations.launchpad.net/unr

Please note that we encourage everyone to translate them in that upstream location before translations flow to Ubuntu.

Notes:

* Deadline: the deadline for translations in the upstream project is the 10th of September, which coincides with the UserInterfaceFreeze milestone. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KarmicReleaseSchedule
* Ubuntu translations: after that date, translations will be imported to Ubuntu at https://translations.launchpad.net/ubuntu/karmic and translators will still be able to modify them or do the last fixes before the Language``Pack``Deadline. The translations will then be included in language packs. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KarmicReleaseSchedule
* Webfav: we are still working on getting webfav translatable through Launchpad. If it is not possible to do this before the translation deadline, and considering that the package has only got one translatable string, we might consider a workaround to allow new translations of this string.

For more information please refer to the following links:

* https://lists.launchpad.net/ubuntu-translations-coordinators/msg00121.html
* https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-translators/2009-May/002502.html

==== Next Ubuntu Global Jam ====

The Ubuntu Global Jam is an incredible opportunity for the Ubuntu community to unite together around the weekend of 2nd - 4th Oct 2009 to work together to improve Ubuntu. Everyone is able to contribute to the Jam, and everyone is welcome and encouraged to get involved. Curious about how to make a real difference to Ubuntu? This is a great chance to make that difference.

The Ubuntu Global Jam incorporates events that have been organized the world over to get Ubuntu contributors and fans together to have a great time and improve Ubuntu. Each event has one or more of our four themes:

* Bugs - finding, triaging and fixing bugs.
* Testing - testing the new release and reporting your feedback.
* Documentation - writing documentation about how to use Ubuntu and how to join the community.
* Translations - translating Ubuntu and helping to make it available in everyone's local language.
* Other - other types of contribution such as marketing, packaging, advocacy etc.

Lo``Cos should not feel required to support all themes, but the Global Jam can be used as an opportunity to introduce members to different aspects of the community.

More information on preparation, including a Jam Tutorial Video and artwork banners for your website see the link below.

==== Jono Bacon: Free Art of Community Book for Approved Ubuntu LoCo Teams ====

Recently I announced my brand spanking new book The Art of Community and so far the reception has been fantastic! Thanks to everyone who has been spreading the news about the book - continue to do your good thing!

Well, I am a firm believer that you should look after your own family, and I am a member of the awesome Ubuntu family, so I have managed to swing a sweet deal with O’Reilly, the publishers of the book, to send all approved USA based teams a free printed copy of the book and all other approved teams a free electronic copy of the book. While we wish we could send all approved teams across the world a free printed copy, O’Reilly are only able to cater to USA based teams right now. Damn economy.

To keep this as simple as possible, you can request your book by following these steps:

1. The team contact shown on our Lo``Co Team List https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LoCoTeamList (and only the team contact) should send me an email to jono AT ubuntu DOT com with the subject line Free Art of Community Book For Lo``Co Team (be sure to type this subject line exactly as here or it may slip through the net).

In your email include all the following details:

* Your full name.
* Which team you are from.
* Your full address (including zip/postal code, region and country).
* Your phone number, including country and area code.

2. I will assess whether you will receive a print or electronic edition.

3. A few weeks after the deadline you should receive your edition of The Art of Community, for free!

A few notes:

* Only approved teams are eligible for the free copies of the book.
* Only the team contact for each team (shown here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LoCoTeamList) can make the request for the book.
* There is a limit of one copy of each book per approved team.
* O’Reilly will kindly cover postage, but not any import tax or other shipping fees.
* When you have the book, it is up to you what you do with it. We recommend you share it between members of the team. Lo``Co Leaders: please don’t hog it for yourselves! I would also really appreciate if you write a review of the book on your nearest Amazon website.
* The deadline for getting your requests in Wed 2nd September 2009.

Make sure you get your requests in by the deadline, anything after that will be sent to the bit bucket.

If you have any questions or queries, feel free to drop me an email.

==== The Squirrels are taking over the forums! ====

It all started out of fun. The Staff decided it was time for another theme week on the forums, and Matthew came up with this squirrel picture (you'll find it in one of the threads). We all gimped our avatars, some even changed it for a pic close to their real location. It did not take much time before our very fast community notices and picks up on the idea. Beware, they are coming in..

==== Daniel Holbach: Computers without internet are no fun ====

You probably heard “Computers without internet are no fun” or “Linux/Ubuntu without internet is no fun” before and your might have had the same feeling the last time your DSL provider had an outage. Fact is that a lot of areas around the world don’t have a cheap, reliable or fast internet, or even internet at all.

The Ubuntu NGO team is trying to make life with Ubuntu easier for organizations working in those areas. Some of you will know how to set up an off-line mirror of the Ubuntu archive, how to set up squid, how to use rsync and so on. Many people don’t. If you have good ideas, know of good documentation, are knowledgeable in that area, please consider joining the team and mailing list. We want to build good documentation and share best-practices, work on small tools to help overcome common problems.

Another area the NGO team is trying to look into is off-line content. Schools in areas with little or no connectivity would benefit from an off-line Wikipedia or other free content and small scripts to assemble that data, update it and use it with or without a small server would be fantastic. If you know a bit about solutions there or would like to help out. Please consider joining the team and mailing list.

==== David Siegel: One Hundred Paper Cuts Round 7 ====

One Hundred Paper Cuts Round 7 (https://edge.launchpad.net/hundredpapercuts/+milestone/round-7) drew to a close last week. Here are the paper cuts that were (or were not) addressed:

* GNOME Panel icons (on right side) move apparently randomly on session start in some situations: https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-panel/+bug/44082
* Dates are not consistently displayed according to locale: https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/evolution/+bug/198346
* Inconsistent spelling of “Filesystem” (vs. “File system”): https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nautilus/+bug/297793
* Change “abort” to “close” or “cancel” in default KDE apps: https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/hundredpapercuts/+bug/389751
* Notification popup should display filename in header and job number in details rather than the other way around: https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/system-config-printer/+bug/404330

The following paper cuts could use a brave soul to push them until they are fixed:

* Downloads should go to ~/Downloads: https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xdg-user-dirs/+bug/204567
* “Home Folder” has 3 different names: https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nautilus/+bug/382703
* “Less than a minute remaining” text is confusing and unnecessary: https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubiquity/+bug/199834
* “Eject” should eject the CD-ROM drive tray: https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-mount/+bug/203574
* Drag and drop of Bookmarks from Places menu copies entire directory instead of creating a link: https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-panel/+bug/62529
* Background image geometry options are confusing: https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/hundredpapercuts/+bug/416605

==== Nick Ali: Support the Ubuntu Global Jam ====

In an effort to help strengthen the communities ties to the Ubuntu Global Jam, Nick suggests adding a banner or badge to our personal or Lo``Co websites. You can find the original source files under Artwork on the Ubuntu Global Jam wiki page here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuGlobalJam The Artwork is attractive and will go a long way towards helping to improve Ubuntu and our community.

=== In The Press ===

==== Dell plans to Linux to expand netbook presence ====

Agam Shah from Computerworld tells us that in an effort to expand its Linux offerings, Dell is researching new netbook-type devices and will soon offer netbook Linux operating system upgrades. Dell is researching the possibility of offering new Linux-based mobile devices called smartbooks, said Todd Finch, senior product marketing manager for Linux clients, at the Open``Source``World conference in San Francisco. The company will also upgrade its Ubuntu Linux operating system for netbooks to the latest version in the next few weeks, he said. Smartbooks are netbook-type devices that are powered by chips designed by Arm. The devices mostly support the Linux operating system and are designed for those who rely on the Web for most of their computing. Dell couldn't say whether it would ultimately offer a smartbook. http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9136733/Dell_plans_to_expand_netbook_presence_with_Linux

==== New Ubuntu Installer Coming Soon ====

Softpedia's Marius Nestor reports that Canonical is working hard these days to redesign the Ubuntu installer (also known as Ubiquity) into something a little more in tune with our times. Ubiquity now has a "Quit" button during all the installation steps, so you can quit the installer at any time. Moreover, the time zone selection items have been changed a little to reflect the region/zone only, and not the city. The updated installer will display some content, every 20 seconds or so, especially created to introduce new users to the Ubuntu operating system, while installing it. The developers have been quoted as saying, "The technology and design for our slide show is now reasonably established, so it's time to polish up the content and get things rolling towards a release." http://news.softpedia.com/news/New-Ubuntu-Installer-Coming-Soon-119569.shtml

==== Ubuntu 9.04 Coming Soon to Dell Netbooks ====

The Linux Loop recognizes that Dell has been somewhat slow in adopting new versions of Ubuntu. Currently, most of Dell’s Ubuntu computers offer Ubuntu 8.04, which was the last long term support release. Dell has changed their minds, though, at least for netbooks, which will soon offer Ubuntu 9.04, the latest release. Previously, Dell had said they planned to use only the LTS (long term support) releases, since they are supposed to be more stable and are updated and given support for a much longer period of time. It is not yet clear if the decision to upgrade all netbooks to Ubuntu 9.04, which is not an LTS release, will also apply to any other Ubuntu computers. http://www.linuxloop.com/2009/08/15/ubuntu-9-04-coming-soon-to-dell-netbooks/

==== Ubuntu netbook is colored to match ====

Jonathan Angel of Linux Devices tells us that Berkeley, Calif.-based system integrator Za``Reason is selling a netbook that includes Ubuntu, and even is available with a matching "mocha" case. The Terra A20 includes the usual Intel Atom N270 CPU, a 10-inch display, a 160GB hard disk drive, and an optional internal cellular modem. Za``Reason's Terra A20 one-ups even Dell by offering pre-installed Ubuntu 9.04 on a netbook that's as full-featured as most any other. According to Za``Reason, the Terra A20 is available now, with prices that start at $350 for a 1GB/160GB configuration. Purchasers may select either Ubuntu, Edubuntu, or Kubuntu. http://www.linuxfordevices.com/c/a/News/ZaReason-Terra-A20/

==== Ubuntu 9.10 Alpha 4 Benchmarks ====

Phoronix's Michael Larabel reports that Ubuntu 9.10 Alpha 4 was released last week and with all of its updated packages and changes compared to Ubuntu 9.04, Phoronix decided to carry out a fresh round of benchmarks comparing Ubuntu 9.04 to Ubuntu 9.10 Alpha 4. Besides some of the synthetic graphics test results being lower in Ubuntu 9.10 Alpha 4, the rest of the Linux desktop
benchmarking spectrum experienced the same or better results. With the switch to EXT4 and some other improvements, in a few tests it shows Ubuntu 9.10 really shining. http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=ubuntu_910_alpha4&num=1

=== In The Blogosphere ===

==== Enhanced Command-Not-Found Hook in Ubuntu 9.10 ====

Christopher Tozzi of Works With U notes that the "command-not-found" hook in Ubuntu 9.10 has been enhanced to give more information.  For example, when trying to run aircrack-ng and it's not on your machine, you would receive the following information:
<pre>
 The program 'aircrack-ng' is currently not installed. You can install it by typing:
 sudo apt-get install aircrack-ng
 You will have to enable the component called 'universe'
 bash: aircrack-ng: command not found
</pre>
It also catches typos, such as typing gdit
<pre>
 No command 'gdit' found, did you mean:
 Command 'edit' from package 'mime-support' (main)
 Command 'gdis' from package 'gdis' (universe)
 Command 'git' from package 'git-core' (main)
 Command 'gedit' from package 'gedit' (main)
 bash: gdit: command not found
</pre>
As Chris says, "The enhancements to this tiny utility in Ubuntu 9.10 go even further in helping users feel comfortable while exploring the command line."  His article is at:  http://www.workswithu.com/2009/08/17/enhanced-command-not-found-hook-in-ubuntu-910/

==== Preview: Ubuntu Experts At Atlanta Linux Fest ====

Joe Panettieri, writing for Works With U, looks at the upcoming Atlantic Linux Fest that will be held on September 19 in Atlanta, Georgia (in the U.S.).  In addition to the participation of several distributions, there will be an Ubucon.  Ubucon Atlanta will have a number of speakers, including:
* Pete Graner, the Ubuntu Kernel manager
* Steve Conklin, also on Kernel team
* Dan Chen, who works with audio in Ubuntu, is attending
* John Pugh, the Canonical ISV manager, is attending
* And several other key Canonical sources may also attend (stay tuned)

Joe feels this is important for people to understand the over-all "big picture" of Ubuntu's strategy.  Read more at:  http://www.workswithu.com/2009/08/19/preview-ubuntu-experts-at-atlanta-linux-fest/

==== Ubuntu 9.10 vs Windows 7: No Ordinary October Showdown ====

Joe Panettieri, writing for Works With U, takes note of the fact that Windows 7 and Ubuntu 9.10 are scheduled to be released within days of each other.  Generally speaking, Windows 7 has earned positive buzz from testers.  However, Ubuntu is aiming for more than just the desktop.  Their thrust includes:
1. Desktops
2. Mobile (Notebooks, Netbooks, MIDs and Smart``Books)
3. Servers and Virtualization
4. Cloud
5. Training
7. Channel Partners and Customers

Joe feels that Ubuntu has become more than just a desktop distribution. See his reasoning at:  http://www.workswithu.com/2009/08/17/ubuntu-910-vs-windows-7-no-ordinary-october-showdown/

==== What’s New in Ubuntu 9.10 ====

Christopher Tozzi, with Works With U, looks at what Ubuntu 9.10 has to offer that's new or changed.  Along with the kernel mode setting and GRUB 2, which he had previously discussed, there are:
1. Ubuntu One - which allows people to share files between computers easily.
2. Empathy - which replaces Pidgin due to it's lack of support for video chat and convoluted software overhead.
3. Gnome interface changes - which has undergone some minor tweaking, like the restoration of the System>Shut Down/Log Out menu and the inclusion of the Gnome Control Center in System>Preferences.

See what Chris has to say at:  http://www.workswithu.com/2009/08/20/whats-new-in-ubuntu-910/

==== What makes me want to work in the Ubuntu Community ====

Helen Mc``Call is a woman of many accomplishments, beginning with mathematical and statistical methods of automated visual identification and finally moving on to Contemporary Circus.  Along the way she became interested in Linux, building her own computer and having to compile the versions that were available at the time (1995) and moving to Ubuntu in 2004.  As she got involved with Contemporary Circus, she began to have the need to make videos both for training and and artistic production, which led her to a search for good video editing software.  One application, called Open``Shot[1] showed a great deal of potential.  She has since joined Ubuntu Women[2] and found ways to overcome some of her problems, like indexing help files and creating .deb files.  Like with any life story, this has no conclusion - only a goal:  to become an Ubuntu member.
