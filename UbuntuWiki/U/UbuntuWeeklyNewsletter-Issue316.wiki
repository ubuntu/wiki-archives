==== Our Community Website ====

Daniel Holbach writes about the progress on the Community part of the ubuntu.com website. 'The first stage of the work is largely done. Michael Hall set up a wordpress test instance here where we put all the updated content, which is a great achievement already. It’s not only up to date, but also much more welcoming and friendly. The Canonical Web team should help us update the style to match the new ubuntu.com site', he mentions.

==== Jono Bacon: Sprinting In Oakland ====

Jono Bacon provides a reflection on the recent Client Sprint he had with other Canonical employees. He states the aim of the Sprint was to "ensure the many different teams working on Ubuntu Touch at Canonical are in sync and working as efficiently as possible."  For those disappointed with the lack of a physical UDS, he says the Sprint was necessary to allow more team coordination and alignment not possible in a UDS setting. However, he is pleased with the progress the team is making to deliver Ubuntu Touch 1.0 by October/November.
