==== Contribute with Ubuntu One Bug Day ====

* Date: Tuesday, 2 February 2010
* Time: 1400-1600 UTC
* Place: Join us in #ubuntuone on freenode in IRC

Each day Ubuntu One usually has at least one representative from the team dedicated to addressing subscriber questions, participating in IRC discussions, and responding to bugs. A few months ago, we decided that this would be enhanced by the entire team collaborating for a short period of time on open bugs and subscriber questions. We called it Bug Day.

The goal was to reduce the list of bugs in an undecided state. After a few months, we’ve found this to be very useful in addressing open issues and questions, identifying duplicates, elevating the overall knowledge of the entire team and sharing best practices.

Tuesday is the next Ubuntu One Bug Day, and this time we’re going to try something a little different. We would like invite our subscribers to join us. This will be an excellent opportunity to learn more about the Ubuntu One service, improve your skills and assist your fellow Ubuntu community members. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuOne/BugDays

==== Lucid changes to Firefox default search provider ====

This announcement is to apprise you of two small but important changes coming to Firefox in Lucid.

We are changing the default search provider in Firefox to Yahoo! Note that this won't in any way effect the ability of a user to choose and use the search provider of their choice. It's literally 2 easily discoverable clicks to change this setting, a simple matter of switching to that search provider in the chrome by clicking on the icon and choosing the desired provider. Note also that Yahoo! does not share any
personally identifiable or usage information.

Why?

We are pursuing this change because Canonical has negotiated a revenue sharing deal with Yahoo! and this revenue will help Canonical to provide developers and resources to continue the open development of Ubuntu and
the Ubuntu Platform. This change will help provide these resources as well as continuing to respect our user's default search across Firefox.

==== Announcement: Ubuntu Server update for Lucid Alpha3 ====

Last week the Lucid Alpha3 development phase started. So in following our Alpha2 announcement below is what’s on the horizon for Alpha3. Some of these are new blueprints for Alpha3 some are continued work from Alpha2.

'''Alpha3 Projects'''

Since the upcoming release is an LTS, a lot of this cycles work is centered around stability. Currently, we’re broadly targeting the following 3 areas:
Software integration

* Eucalyptus 1.6.2
* Moving from MySQL 5.0 to 5.1
* Provide libraries in PHP/Python/Perl for AWS services

Improving our UEC & EC2 experience

* Integrating Puppet & Etckeeper
* Provide boothooks & user based configuration

'''QA & testing'''

* UEC tests
* Automated server tests
* Bug squashing
* Apport hooks
* Daily builds for server packages
* The Server Papercuts project

There are also a few community driven specs which are targeted for the Lucid release:

* Asterisk Integration
* Ubuntu Cluster Stack
* Ubuntu Server Containers (LXC, OpenVZ)
* Integration of Amavisd-new, Spamassassin, and Clamav

The full list of blueprints related to these targets and our progress can be found on the server team wiki or on our work item tracker.

'''Feedback & Involvement'''

If you have any suggestions for AWS libraries in PHP/Perl/Python or are interested in packaging/contributing a library in another language, please let us know in the RFC thread

To make the most of our Server Papercuts project, please participate in the email discussion and nominate papercuts and/or volunteer to fix them!

To help us track down bugs and crashes better, we’re adding apport hooks to several key pieces of software. If you’d like to implement any of those hooks or contribute your own, please let us know in
the blueprint.

The Ubuntu Cluster Stack spec has issued a call for testing and would love to hear about your experiences.

==== Interview With Ubuntu Manual Project Leader Ben Humphrey ====

The Ubuntu Manual Project has stirred up veritable carnival of publicity over the last few months, signifying a huge appetite for such a document within the community. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-manual Here is an interview with Benjamin Humphrey the project leader.

''' Let's go back to the start: Where did the idea of creating a "beginners manual” come from? '''

It all started halfway through last year. I had been helping users troubleshoot their problems on the Ubuntu Forums, and I also had a fair few of my own problems with Ubuntu when I started using it for the first time. I quickly learnt to resolve these, and, as time went by, I helped others too. I wrote a bit of Community Documentation, but felt the need to pass my knowledge on to more new users - so I started my blog with that intention. The blog articles then began to be exported into a PDF, which started to take shape as a manual. The project didn't become open for collaboration until late last year when I realized it would be more beneficial to have many people working on it as a team - that way we could cover more stuff and make a better document overall.

''' Who is the manual aimed at? '''

Our target audience is new computer users, and users coming from Windows/Mac, who otherwise wouldn't know much about Ubuntu or GNU/Linux in general.

''' What differentiates the Ubuntu Manual Project from the official documentation, official books, etc that already exist for newcomers? '''

Content wise, we go into less detail than the documentation and wiki. We aren't supposed to be an all-encompassing Ubuntu bible, like the Official Ubuntu Book. The manual is a free PDF download, it will hopefully be included in Ubuntu 10.04 LTS as well. It will be translated in over 30 languages, possibly available for purchase in print, and also will feature many localized screenshots.

It's more organized than the wiki documentation and easier to access than the forums. It will also be kept up to date with revisions every six months to coincide with the Ubuntu release cycle. We will be pointing readers in the direction of the in-built help, or the wiki help, or the forums if they need more detail on a specific topic.

''' What areas will the 'manual' be covering? '''

The manual follows a linear learning curve - it starts with the basics (like an introduction about Ubuntu's philosophy and history), then moves to explaining the desktop, default applications, getting online, installing software and so forth. It's split into two sections, the first half and the second half - we don't even mention the command line until the second half, the "advanced" section. The full table of contents can be found here.

''' What won’t the manual be going into? '''

A lot of stuff. As I said above, this isn't an Ubuntu bible - we're not going to have a guide for installing Nvidia drivers on a Ge``Force 7600GT graphics card, for example. It won't be that specific - we will give you a general idea on how to do something, show you the basics, and then point you in the right direction for more information.

''' So the big question is – will it be included in Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid Lynx? '''

At the moment, we're not sure. I know many people would love to see it on the CD - our research proves that, and my talks with Ubuntu members/key contributors also shows there is a great deal of interest in the project. If everything goes to plan, I think it would be silly to not include a version in Lucid and make it available for download at www.ubuntu.com.

What's working against us is file size. With more than 50 pages, and a whole heap of images, we'll be hard pressed to get it down to a small enough size to squeeze onto the CD. Remember a CD can only hold 700mb - the Ubuntu devs have to fit a whole operating system and several applications onto that. I think we can get it down to a small enough size for it to be included as example content at least, but it's really too early to tell as we haven't even started inserting images yet. If we can't get it into Lucid, I will try to get it included it for 10.10. It will be much easier to convince the desktop team/docs team once we have something to show.

''' If it does make it into Lucid, where can users expect to find access to the manual? Desktop icon? Menu Entry, etc? '''

This hasn't been decided yet. While we would love to see it as an icon on the desktop, this just won't happen - the desktop team have a strict no icons on the desktop policy as a "design decision." It will most likely appear in the main application menu, or as an icon on the panel. It will hopefully also be available for download right next to the main download link for Ubuntu on the website.

And just to hedge my bets - How will users be able to ‘find’ the manual if it ISN'T included in Lucid?
If it isn't included in Lucid, we will try to get it on the main Ubuntu website and most definitely in the main repository. We will probably also set up our own website with a download link, and of course it will be available on our Launchpad page as well.

==== Ubuntu Honduras ====

Ubuntu Honduras kicked off the 2010 year of activities with a team pizza party where they discussed upcoming events for 2010, and welcomed new members. The team set the agenda for the next 3 months which includes, an Ubuntu presentation at Universidad de San Pedro Sula, and a two hour talk  at the T3 conference  Escuela Internacional Sanpedrana. The team is also discussing a couple of workshops they hope to have. One for team members to help them gain experience and improve their knowledge of Ubuntu, and the second that they will have at area universities. Pictures of the pizza party are here: http://picasaweb.google.com/elvira.martinez38/PrimerPizzaBashSanPedroSula2010#

=== Launchpad News ===

==== Back up old sources from PPA's ====

We’ve been overwhelmed by the popularity of PPAs on Launchpad. In fact, according to our sysadmins, they are a little too popular and now our disks are full.

Full disks mean no more PPAs, and no more uploads to PPAs. We’d like to add some more disks, but we can’t actually do that soon enough for a bunch of complicated reasons.

Instead, we’ve decided that we’re going to remove all of the source files for any uploads that are:

* in PPAs
* not published, that is, deleted or superseded
* have been not published for over seven days

Note that we already delete the binaries for such uploads.

We are going to delete these old files this Wednesday, January 27th. We’re really sorry that we are announcing it so close to the actual event — we know it’s a hassle.

If you want to keep any of these files, you are going to have to download them right now. Here’s how to do it.

1. Go to your PPA’s web page on Launchpad and click on “View package details”.
2. Change the filter to search for “Any status”. Click “Filter”.
3. For each superseded or deleted upload with files you want to save, expand the upload and manually save all the files under the “Package files” heading.

If it’s a busy PPA like the example one, then there will be a lot of old versions to download. If you aren’t sure, you probably won’t need all of them. Ask on #launchpad on Freenode or the launchpad-users mailing list if you are unsure.

http://blog.launchpad.net/general/action-back-up-old-sources-from-ppas

==== Improved Bug Patch Notifications ====

There are a couple of new features related to patch handling in Launchpad bugs this month.

Building on the work we did in December to better distinguish patches in bug pages, we now use an icon to show if a bug has a patch attached in bug listings.  Any search on Launchpad will now indicate if a bug has a patch attached.  Look for the band aid icons, and you’ll know that a bug has a patch attached.

Also, bug mail notifications have been updated to distinguish patches from any other attachment.  Now when a patch is added or removed from a bug the email notification will read “Patch added” or “Patch removed” to make spotting patches easier in email.

These are small improvements to our handling of patches to help patches become more easily spotted on Launchpad.  Combined with our work on sorting bugs by a heat number, the Launchpad bugs app is doing more to let users know about the state and quality of a bug report.

==== Getting your code into Launchpad ====

Brad has written a great guide to writing and committing your first code for Launchpad.

Amongst other things, he has a useful bullet list that describes the steps between deciding you want to write code for Launchpad and actually seeing your work in place. http://bradcrittenden.net/post/358363191/getting-your-code-into-launchpad

* The steps for fixing a bug or adding a new feature in Launchpad are:

** Find a bug or feature request. The best place to look is on the milestone for the application of interest. (See the list for Launchpad Registry’s 10.02 milestone).
** Research the problem.
** Have a pre-implemention call.
** Grab the latest branch of Launchpad (which we informally call ‘rocketfuel’). You can use ‘rocketfuel-get’ to update your copy of devel and ‘rocketfuel-branch’ to make a branch for your work. It’s best to create a new branch for each chunk of work you do.
** Write your tests, write the code, repeat. (Read about TDD.)
** Push your code to Launchpad (‘bzr push’).
** Create a merge proposal (‘bzr send’).
** Have a review, fix changes, repeat.
** Run the tests. At a minimum you should run all the tests for the application you changed. For bugs you can do that with ‘bin/test -vvm lp.bugs’.
** Submit to PQM.
** QA the change when it lands on edge or staging.
** See the change in production when the next release rolls out.
** Bask in your awesomeness.

==== Daniel Holbach: Ubuntu Developer Week Recap ====

UDW was another rocking success in terms of getting things done, and having fun doing it. So much was accomplished in such a short amount of time. Thanks to everyone who attended and contributed. You can find daily summaries of what happened at the following links.

* UDW Day One: http://daniel.holba.ch/blog/?p=571
* UDW Day Two: http://daniel.holba.ch/blog/?p=575
* UDW Day Three: http://daniel.holba.ch/blog/?p=595
* UDW Day Four: http://daniel.holba.ch/blog/?p=597

==== Steve George: Canonical Voices ====

Want to know Canonical’s secret business plan? Or find out the latest features we’re working on in Ubuntu or Ubuntu``One? Then hop over to the Canonical Voices site.  It’s a blog aggregator that provides a single location for Canonical employees to blog and engage with the wider world.

Many Canonical employees develop Ubuntu directly making them members of the Ubuntu community so their views already appear on Ubuntu Planet. However, there are lots of Canonical employees who work in other areas, such as with OEM’s, or on Ubuntu``One, in marketing or with business customers. Canonical voices brings together everyone in the company and provides a single place where you can see the breadth of their views, opinions and thoughts.

As an Open Source technology company we’re working within a variety of communities; sometimes that means an Open Source project, but it could mean a group of users or a set of companies. So it’s important for us to be transparent and to engage in a conversation – encouraging understanding and perhaps sparking interesting ideas. Canonical Voices provides a space for that.

==== Elizabeth Krumbach: Ubuntu Community Learning Project Update ====

The UCLP is attempting to make professional education course materials, because we believe that education is one of the biggest barriers to getting new users and increasing existing users abilities. We are working to develop course material in 5 different segments, How to Use, Maintain, Develop, Spread and Teach Ubuntu. This material is structured in the form of classes that can be taught in real life classrooms, on IRC and/or via our Moodle site. We now have a documented Course Layout for in-classroom classes and Charles Profitt has been working on the Moodle side for online learning.

How do you contribute? First, join the team by swinging by to have a talk to us in #ubuntu-learning or engage us on the Ubuntu Community Learning Project mailing list (you’re also welcome to email me directly at lyz at ubuntu dot com, please do!). We currently have people writing courses in .odt, on the wiki, in bzr using Ascii``Doc and in Moodle, so there are a number of ways to get involved now. We also need folks who are interested in doing peer review of the classes.

==== Eric Hammond: Southern California Linux Expo ====

* February 19-21, 2010 at the Westin LAX

The 8th Southern California Linux Expo (aka SCaLE 8x) is a community organized, non-profit event. Those words and the incredibly cheap price might lead you to believe that it is not worth going to, but if this is your first time you’ll be amazed by the size, scope, and professionalism of the event with nearly a hundred exhibits and dozens of informative talks.

* SCa``LE: http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/

Even though you’re not paying hundreds of dollars for the conference fee, it’s still worth traveling to if you’re not in Los Angeles. If you are in LA, then you have no excuse.

Just like last year at SCa``LE, I will be leading another “Try-It Lab” where we’ll help folks get started with using Amazon EC2 and Ubuntu Linux. More information about preparation will be posted on the SCa``LE web site, so be sure to review it before attending if you’re interested in a hands-on, guided, workshop experience with EC2. The lab seats “sold out” quickly last year, so make sure you get in early.

Deal for readers of Alestic.com: When you register for SCa``LE, use the code “ERIC” for 50% off of the listed price. If you sign up today, that gives you a full access pass for a ridiculously low $35. Prices may go up as the weekend gets closer.

==== Nouveau From 2.6.33 Prep'd For Ubuntu 10.04 ====

Michael Larabel of Phoronix recalls that back in November he shared that Nouveau would finally be pulled into the Ubuntu 10.04 kernel as up to this point Canonical had employed the feature-limited and obfuscated open-source NVIDIA driver known as xf86-video-nv. The plans to switch over to Nouveau with kernel mode-setting support for Ubuntu 10.04 were great, but then in December the Nouveau driver got pulled into the Linux 2.6.33 kernel which complicated matters for Ubuntu as they already were set with using the Linux 2.6.32 kernel for the 10.04 LTS "Lucid Lynx" release. It looks like the Canonical kernel developers have decided to pull the Nouveau DRM from the 2.6.33-rc4 kernel, and the Nouveau KMS code will be pulled in for the next alpha release. More information at the link.

http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=NzkyNw

==== Updates Coming For Ubuntu Server 10.04 LTS ====

Phoronix's Michael Larabel tells us that Canonical's Jos Boumans sent out an e-mail on the Ubuntu development mailing list to outline some of the new plans going forward for Ubuntu Server with the 10.04 release. Ubuntu 10.04 LTS Alpha 2 came out just nine days ago, but Jos is hoping to incorporate these new Ubuntu Server changes prior to the Alpha 3 release that is scheduled for the end of February. To be worked on for Ubuntu Server 10.04 Alpha 3 is migrating from My``SQL 5.0 to My``SQL 5.1, an upgrade to Eucalyptus 1.6.2, PHP/Python/Perl libraries for Amazon's cloud computing platform, integrating Puppet and Etckeeper, boothooks and user based configuration for UEC/EC2, and various QA improvements. For the Ubuntu Server 10.04 release the community also hopes to provide Asterisk integration, an Ubuntu Cluster Stack, Ubuntu Server Containers for LXC and Open``VZ, and integration of Amavisd-new, Spamassassin, and Clamav.

==== Yahoo Pays Canonical, Now They're The Ubuntu Default ====

Michael Larabel of Phoronix reports that Canonical's Rick Spencer has written about two small changes that are happening to Mozilla Firefox in Ubuntu 10.04. The first is the default Ubuntu home-page with its search box in Firefox will now follow whatever the user has set as their default search engine in Firefox. The second change is that Canonical is changing the default search engine for Firefox in Ubuntu to Yahoo. Google has always been the default search engine in Ubuntu's Firefox, but now it's changing to Yahoo beginning with Lucid Lynx. Canonical is changing the default search path over to Yahoo as the two companies have negotiated a revenue sharing deal off the advertisements when using Yahoo search on Ubuntu. Users can still switch Firefox to using Google search with a couple clicks, but Canonical is hoping this change will yield them some additional revenue.

==== Does Ubuntu Need Server Hardware Partners? ====

When Joe Panettieri helped launch Works``With``U in 2008, he strongly believed Canonical needed to build strong server hardware partnerships with Dell, IBM and Hewlett-Packard. But as he heard more about Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud (UEC) in 2009, he realized Ubuntu in 2010 may find a back door into the server market. He still think it’s important for Canonical to work with hardware markers on Ubuntu Server Edition. Pre-install deals and bundling deals would be great. Fingers crossed, maybe we’ll see some deals around the time of Ubuntu Server Edition 10.04’s scheduled April 2010 launch. But if those server hardware relationships don’t materialize he won’t press the panic button. The reason: He thinks Canonical’s cloud strategy — built around Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud — represents a back door into the server market. See more of Joe's reasoning at the link.

==== Ubuntu Unleashed 2010 Edition Review ====

The Linux Blog takes a look at the Ubuntu Unleashed 2010 edition. The author found themselves turning to their bookshelf when a re-install was needed, and found "Ubuntu Unleashed 2010 Edition" coming their aid. The author notes, "Normally by the time a book hits my shelf the material is outdated, not necessarily useless, just not the most up to date. This is an exception. The Ubuntu Unleashed 2010 Edition was updated with an Ubuntu 9.10 DVD and a “Free Upgrade to Ubuntu 10.04″ which I found out that if you buy the book before the end of 2010 you can get an upgrade kit in the mail."

In the author's opinion the book is packed full of information, 32 chapters and a hefty appendix. The author felt that the book was well written, and would be of interest to Linux users in general, and not just Ubuntu users. Looking a handy reference book for 2010? Check out the full article and see if this book would make great edition to your bookshelf.

==== Ubuntu Could Profit From Both Yahoo, Google ====

Joe Panettieri of Works With U takes a look at Canonical's relationship with both Google and Yahoo. He notes that it is a balancing act between the two, finding ways to financially aid the continuation of Ubuntu.

Panettieri when looking for the why this change is being made,  sites Rick Spencer's (Canonical Desktop Manager) January 26th, announcement on the ubuntu-devel mailing list: "“I am pursuing this change because Canonical has negotiated a revenue sharing deal with Yahoo! and this revenue will help Canonical to provide developers and resources to continue the open development of Ubuntu and the Ubuntu Platform. This change will help provide these resources as well as continuing to respect our user’s default search across Firefox.”"

Canonical is under contract with Google to help in the development of Chrome OS. And now it has a financial arrangement with Yahoo to promote the Yahoo search in the Firefox search bar. How much the two will help is unknown. The following link has the Panettieri's full article as well as the link to Rick Spencer's announcement.

==== Ubuntu: Enterprise Management Getting Easier? ====

Joe Panettieri of Works With U asks the question, "Are Ubuntu servers and desktops easy for enterprises to manage?" The answer appears to be "maybe". More IT specialists are getting on board, such as Bomgar, Kaseya, Likewise Software, Groundwork Open Source and Canonical itself.

Panettieri notes that Canonical offers Landscape - a remote management platform and Landscape Dedicated Server  - and on-premise solution.  He outlines 5 contributions  to making enterprise management easier in his article.

* Ubuntu Support
* Kaseya and Kasey2
* Likewise Software
* Landscape
* Bomgar

However, he also mentions that it's too soon to tell what effect it will have on acceptance. see the his article and links to those contributions at:

==== The choices inside Ubuntu ====

Hearing that the next Ubuntu release will use Yahoo! as the default search engine in Firefox leaves me with a twinge of uneasiness. This bloggers misgiving -- and it's a small one -- is not so much with the decision as with why it was made. In itself, the decision is trivial enough. If you dislike Yahoo!, you can easily change the default by going to the search engine field in the upper right corner and clicking on the icon and choosing Manage Search Engines from the drop-down menu. The reason for the change is that Canonical has negotiated a revenue sharing deal with Yahoo, and this revenue will help Canonical to provide developers and resources to continue the open development of Ubuntu and the Ubuntu Platform. This change will help provide these resources as well as continuing to respect our user's default search across Firefox. Some people will object to the deal automatically, because, last year, Microsoft emerged as one of Yahoo's major partners. But that seems a relatively remote concern. What makes me uneasy is that the change is apparently being done solely for business reasons. This blogger understands that Canonical is searching for the road to profitability, but Foss isn't suppose to be like that, and neither is Ubuntu.

==== Apple’s iPad vs Notion Ink’s Adam tablet with Ubuntu: battle of two worlds ====

Sola believes that the new iPad was received with mixed feelings by the IT savey community. The main problem is that the tablet is just not as revolutionary as many expected it would be. It keeps many of the limitations of the iPhone (no multitasking, tightly controlled app-store), and doesn’t provide impressive new features which could keep the balance. On the other hand, Ubuntu on the Adam can run any full-desktop or command line Linux/ARM software from the Ubuntu ARM repositories. This is a huge selection of software and includes powerful applications like Open``Office, GIMP and others. These may not be optimized for the touch screen interface but the Adam’s backside trackpad can help using them in tablet mode and in docked mode you will be able to use a USB mouse and keyboard just like with a netbook. Moreover, Ubuntu is completely free of limitations so you will be able install whatever software you want.

==== NZ school ditches Microsoft and goes totally open source ====

A New Zealand high school running entirely on open source software has slashed its server requirements by a factor of almost 50, despite a government deal mandating the use of Microsoft software in all schools. Albany Senior High School in the northern suburbs of Auckland has been running an entirely open source infrastructure since it opened in 2009. The 230-pupil school was set up to follow open learning principles, offering large "learning commons" areas where multiple classes interact rather than conventional classrooms and setting aside one day each week for pupils to work on self-driven research projects. The implementation uses Ubuntu on the desktop.
