=== LoCo News ===

==== About our Mailing List ====

Simon Quigley runs through the advantages and disadvantages of having a mailing list hosted by Launchpad instead of using the traditional Ubuntu lists. He also summarizes some of the newsletters that he forwards to the list and concludes: “Although it has it's downsides, using Launchpad for our mailing list has been very smooth for us and the advantages outweigh the disadvantages, in my honest opinion. So we will continue to use it.”

==== Ubuntu at SCALE14x ====

Elizabeth K. Joseph writes about her long weekend in Pasadena from January 21-24th when she participated in the 14th Annual Southern California Linux Expo (SCALE14x) which also included the first Ubu``Con Summit. With the aid of some photographs she sets out the highlights of the weekend, mentions some of the people she met, and summarizes her own presentation which was entitled “Building a career with Ubuntu and FOSS.” She shares a number of links to videos of the various sessions, and also to her personal flickr site which hosts some of the many photographs that she took at the event.

==== Dustin Kirkland: adapt install [anything] ====

Dustin Kirkland back from speaking at SCALE14x, tells us about ‘adapt’ which is a package installer that will install any package from any Ubuntu release onto any version of ubuntu. He says that this allows the running of an LTS but also allows the installation of packages from later versions of Ubuntu and that this is achieved through the use of architecture independent LXD system containers. A PDF of the slides from Dustin’s SCALE14x talk is provided by link.
