=== In the Blogosphere ===

==== NVIDIA 440.59 Linux Driver Brings DP MST Audio, PRIME Sync For Linux 5.4+ ====

Michael Larabel reports that NVIDIA has released the 440.59 Linux driver. This updated driver includes many fixes with details listed, plus a link to nvidia.com to download the driver.

https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=NVIDIA-440.59-Linux-Driver

==== Linux-Firmware Adds Updated Binary For Fixing Performance With RX 5600 XT vBIOS Update ====

Michael Larabel reminds us of the Radeon RX 5600 XT's recent release, and its problems giving low performance when run on Linux. The updated firmware to resolve this issue has now passed QA (Quality Assurance) and is available, which rectifies the performance issue. Links are provided.

https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=RX-5600-XT-New-SMC-Micro

==== Systemd 245 Shipping Soon With Systemd-Homed, Systemd-Repart Partitioner ====

Michael Larabel informs us that Systemd 245, a large release, will ship soon. This release Includes systemd-homed, systemd-repart, as well as new features to other parts - such as systemd-journald. Systemd 245 RC1 is available for testing with a link provided.

https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=systemd-245-RC1

==== Ubuntu 20.04 LTS Likely To Ship With Linux 5.4 As Opposed To 5.5 ====

Michael Larabel writes that whilst Linux 5.5 kernel has been released, it's probable that the current 5.4 kernel in Ubuntu 20.04 will be the default kernel shipped. However, upstream kernels will be available with the enablement of the Hard``Ware Enablement (HWE) stack. Michael gives the reasoning for these likely decisions, and reminds us that the Ubuntu kernel team has backported Wire``Guard support to the 5.4 LTS kernel. Links are provided.

==== Ubuntu 20.04 LTS Aims To Enhance The Certified OEM Experience From Its Installer ====

Michael Larabel writes that booting the Ubuntu 20.04 LTS install media on a "Certified OEM" device could provide a different experience to other devices. We are told that Ubuntu developers are working on GRUB checking the device using an SMBIOS module providing added functionality if a certified device is detected. A link to the mailing list post for more detail is provided.

==== Devs Push for Unicode 13 Support in Ubuntu 20.04 LTS ====

Joey Sneddon gives us a quick background on Unicode, before telling us Unicode 13 is due out March 10, with a request on the Ubuntu developer mailing list to consider packaging ICU 66 for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. A response from Ubuntu's Dimitri John Ledkov has said it's too late for inclusion. Joey tells us a preview of ICU 66 is available.
