==== Status of Ubuntu Mesa backports ====

Timo Aaltonen reports that in order to backport Mesa 18.0.5 to Ubuntu 16.04, it first has to get to Ubuntu 18.04, so that upgrades from the first release to the latter will be smooth once Mesa 18.0.5 is released to 16.04 - which is already in process. Additionally, Mesa 18.1.1 is available for 18.04 via the X-Updates PPA.
