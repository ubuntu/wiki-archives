==== Ubuntu 12.10 (Quantal Quetzal) Beta 1 Released. ====

Kate Stewart announces the release of Ubuntu 12.10 (Quantal Quetzal) Beta 1:

“The Ubuntu team is pleased to announce the first beta release of Ubuntu 12.10 Desktop, Server, Cloud, and Core products.

Codenamed "Quantal Quetzal", 12.10 continues Ubuntu's proud tradition of integrating the latest and greatest open source technologies into a high-quality, easy-to-use Linux distribution. The team has been hard at work through this cycle, introducing new features and fixing bugs.

For the client, this release now has a consolidated Ubuntu image. There is no longer a traditional CD sized image, DVD or alternate image, but rather a single 800MB Ubuntu image that can be used from USB or DVD. This change does not affect Ubuntu Server, which remains a traditional CD sized image.  

With Ubuntu 12.10, Kubuntu, Edubuntu, Lubuntu, and Ubuntu Studio also reached Beta 1 status today. These images, along with Xubuntu will continue to have daily updates for the remainder of the release.”

Michael Hall shares some insights on how the newly proposed specification for developers to get their applications into the Software Center was created. He highlights some of the problems with the previous process and discusses how the team collaborated to put together a possible solution to fix the issues. The spec was released to the community to gain feedback and is not yet final.

http://mhall119.com/2012/09/how-the-appdevuploadprocess-was-written/

==== Daniel Holbach: Hanging out with Ubuntu developers ====

Daniel Holbach blogs about a new series of Google Hangouts where developers interested in helping to make 12.10 a great release can join to learn more about development and bug fixing. It also serves as a great way to get to know the developers a little better. Sessions start this week and will be on Tuesdays and Thursdays for anyone interested in attending.

http://daniel.holba.ch/blog/2012/09/hanging-out-with-ubuntu-developers/

==== No Quantal Beta 1 for Xubuntu ====

The Xubuntu team didn’t release Beta 1 this cycle citing, among the reasons, a desire to fix several important bugs and reduce the image size in order to make Beta 2 the very best possible. Despite the absence of Beta 1, daily updates will be released and Xubuntu Beta 2 will be released toward the end of the month.

http://xubuntu.org/news/no-quantal-beta-1-for-xubuntu/

==== Thomas Ward: Servers and PHP FPM: The New Method in Quantal ====

Thomas Ward writes that the PHP FPM package has been modified in both Debian and Ubuntu to listen on a UNIX socket by default, running at /var/run/php5-fpm.sock, and stresses: “Anyone upgrading to Quantal from Precise or earlier which have servers using php5-fpm assuming that it’ll continue to listen on 127.0.0.1:9000 will need to change their configurations to adapt for this change!”

http://lordoftime.info/?p=39

==== Ted Gould: Desktop in the Cloud ====

Ted Gould details a new feature in Ubuntu 12.10 that he is excited about: the ability to log in to a remote desktop. By using the guest account feature, users can connect to their remote desktops located anywhere on the Internet. The remote desktop is integrated with your Ubuntu SSO, meaning that a user needs only to provide their SSO to be able to see a list of their available servers to connect to.
