==== Compromised LoCo Servers (What are your options) ====

The recent compromise of the community hosted servers has received considerable scrutiny both in the linux press and through the mailing lists. However, since some of the community do not subscribe to the loco-contacts mailing list, there remains some confusion about what steps Lo``Cos need to take. 

The Canonical staff wishes to point out that this event had no effect on the code, packages, or CD's for Ubuntu. 

Here are the two options available to Lo``Cos:
* First, if a Lo``Co  is using one of the "approved" webapps listed in the e-mail, https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/loco-contacts/2007-August/001510.html,  the Lo``Co is welcome to use the hosting provided by the Canonical sysadmin team in the London based Canonical data center (CDC). If third-party modules or plugins are needed, they will need to be audited for security before being activated.
* Second, if the Lo``Co is not using an approved application and doesn't feel migration to a supported application is possible, the application can continue to be hosted on the community servers. The community servers will still be maintained, but not allocated the same administrative resources that the CDC hosted sites will receive. The PHP, CGI, and other executable codes on the community servers will need to be replaced since they may have been compromised.

All of the above means, "don't worry, everything is going to be OK." Also, each site will need to make arrangements for getting their site set up in the proper place. 
To do this, follow these steps:
* A. File a bug at https://launchpad.net/loco-webhosting. 
* B. Contact us to make sure we can make DNS changes for your site by filing a bug at https://launchpad.net/loco-webhosting. This process is not instantaneous unfortunately.

As always, be patient, Lo``Co teams far outnumber sysadmins.

If you do not yet have Canonical sponsored hosting and are an approved team, but would like to have hosting, please understand that there will be a longer than usual delay, and see the existing instructions at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LoCoHosting.

==== Celebratory Hug Day - 22 Aug 2007 ====

In celebration of the 10th anniversary of the GNOME project we are having a very special Hug Day on Wednesday, August 22nd.  We will be focusing on the collaboration between the Ubuntu and GNOME projects by working on the following topics:
* Linking related bugs in Malone to GNOME's bugzilla.
* Ensuring that any forwarded bug reports have the same information and are complete.
* Reproducing crasher bugs in GNOME's bugzilla in the development release of Ubuntu to provide a detailed crash report for GNOME.
There will be a list of types of bugs including specifically targeted bugs at: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBugDay/20070822 So on 22 August 2007, in all timezones, we'll be meeting in #ubuntu-bugs on irc.freenode.net for a very special Hug Day. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBugDay If you're interested in helping to improve Ubuntu and GNOME, please join us. Feel free to ask pedro, bdmurray, heno and the rest of the team for ways to help out.  We hope to see you there and your name on the list of
bug triagers! https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-users/2007-August/121367.html

==== LinuxMCE Releases Media Centre Addon to Kubuntu ====

When picking a media center solution for your PC, it tends to be a matter of compromise. There are solutions that are visually attractive, solutions that are Free/open source software, solutions that are more complete than others and solutions that integrate well with a desktop environment. In the past there have been few, if any, that have been all of these things. After an extensive beta testing period a new version of LinuxMCE, release 0704, was recently made available to the public that shows how we can indeed have our media center cake and eat it too. See more at http://dot.kde.org/1187201437/ and http://linuxmce.com/

=== LoCo News ===

The Ubuntu Loco-Team in Portugal, the Portuguese translation team and also a few free software friends in Portugal had been discussing a project specialized in implementing Ubuntu in Portuguese Schools for a few months (on the ubuntuescolas at googlegroups.com mailing list and in Freenode #ubuntu-pt). The discussions have led to the conclusion that the Lo``Co should focus all the efforts in a more general project, which could include other free software distributions as well. The websites, http://www.escolaslivres.org and a forum at http://www.escolaslivres.org/forum, have been setup and already have some interesting content. There has been a substantial amount of input in the first days already.  If you are a Portuguese speaker, interested in Free Software in schools, join us and contribute!

=== Launchpad News ===

Wednesday 22nd August sees the release of Launchpad 1.1.8! Full details of what's new in Launchpad will be posted to the Launchpad News blog (http://news.launchpad.net/) and in the next issue of UWN.

=== In The Press ===

* Ubuntu tries to go Loco in all 50 states - The Ubuntu community is seeking to get approved Local Community (Loco) teams in all 50 states in the US by the end of this year, and it's making impressive progress. Christer Edwards, founder of the Utah Loco team and one of the founders of the US Teams project, says, "As one of the few US Teams leaders, I felt a bit of a responsibility to share what I had done with the rest of the country. Myself, Aaron Toponce (also of the Utah Team), and Stephen Stalcup (of the Ohio Team) started the US Teams project. Our goal was to create a team-building framework, improve communication between teams, and build a small group of mentors to help users build their teams with one-on-one guidance." Long-time Linux users may be wondering why there's a need for Ubuntu Loco teams when so many Linux user groups already exist, and whether the Loco teams are competing with LUGs. Edwards says that the Loco teams exist to "advocate, educate, and support the use of Ubuntu" specifically, and that they try hard not to compete with existing LUGs. In fact, Edwards says a Loco team can assist LUGs. "By offering Ubuntu-specific education and resources to existing regional and university-based LUGs, we can help them improve their attendance and user experience. http://www.linux.com/feature/118583

* Cedric Janssens, French Speaking Press Contact for Ubuntu-be.org was invited to a Belgian tech podcast (in French). In the first half of the podcast, he presented Ubuntu, described the French-speaking Ubuntu community structure (ways to find websites and help are given at the end of the interview), and discussed several open-source applications such as Open``Office.org, Firefox and Thunderbird. The professional support offered to business companies or public administrations is also presented, in addition to security issues handling in open-source projects. For the complete interview and a 3D video of the Ubuntu desktop, please see: http://www.lepetitjournal.com/content/view/17621/1257/

* Ubuntu Servers Compromised - This last week, 5 of the 8 servers that are loco hosted but Canonical sponsored, had to be shut down due to reports that they were actively attacking other machines. - http://osdir.com/Article9888.phtml

=== In The Blogosphere ===

* XP, Vista, MacOS X and Ubuntu Linux: Innovations at Risk - As I ponder the coming need to replace my fast aging IBM Thinkpad T40, I am faced with a tough choice. Do I continue using Windows? I decided to download and install Ubuntu Linux. Since the arrival of Ubuntu, Linux installation has become increasingly easy. While Ubuntu doesn’t support as many devices as Windows does, Ubuntu does a great job. The fact that the Ubuntu CD comes with major productivity software already bundled makes perfect sense. If you are weary of such a major switch, you can even run the CD live, that is, you don’t have to install Ubuntu until you are ready.http://www.bityard.com/article.php?sid=909#Adds

* Lunch Meet: Ubuntu is Linux for Human Beings - Ubuntu is a GNU/Linux distribution that is quite useable and easy to install. Based on debian and GNOME, ubuntu offers extensive hardware recognition combined with a functional desktop environment complete with a suite of office applications. While at Linuxworld in San Francisco, I had a chat with ubuntu's Kevin Shuk, who gives me a demo. Video available by clicking on the link. http://www.podtech.net/home/3854/lunchmeet-ubuntu-is-linux-for-human-beings

* Review: Dell Inspiron 1420N with Ubuntu - The time seems right for a company like Dell to partner with a distribution like Ubuntu and bring Linux to the masses. Unfortunately, Dell and Ubuntu’s parent company Canonical have not worked together closely enough to make this a first-rate offering. While I think the 1420N is a great computer overall, the lack of attention to detail (and unbelievably bad driver support) keep these latest Linux offerings from being ready for the general public. Hopefully Dell and Canonical will resolve these problems and make a truly great product that I could feel comfortable recommending to family members who are not familiar with Linux.http://www.starryhope.com/dell/2007/review-dell-inspiron-1420n-with-ubuntu/

* Vista Ultimate vs. Ubuntu 7.04 - Which Install Is Easier? - So less than 3 hours into this experiment, I have both Vista and Ubuntu installed and patched. Both systems are stable, more or less, but both systems have quirks. Neither system worked perfectly, but much to my surprise the Ubuntu system worked better, (once I got the keyboard working). More hardware worked without needing to download additional drivers. More over, the desktop that I do have is more functional - applications like GIMP, Open Office, and a slew of multi-media apps are far more useful than Wordpad, Paint and the slew of crap that Vista comes with. I am left with the feeling that Ubuntu passed the install test with a higher mark than Vista. While it may lack some of the polish of Microsoft’s flagship product, in this test, on my machine, it was the better OS.http://scitech.teambio.org/2007/08/14/vista-ultimate-vs-ubuntu-704-which-install-is-easier/

* How to install Ubuntu 7.04 (Feisty Fawn) in OS X using Parallels Desktop 3.0 - a complete walkthrough - This tutorial will take you every single step of the way through installing Ubuntu 7.04 (Feisty Fawn) using Parallels Desktop 3.0 (Build 4128) for OS X. In other words, even your parents should be able to follow along. This tutorial is for anyone with an Intel based Mac who is curious about Linux - specifically Ubuntu, and has about an hour to kill (not including the time it takes to download Ubuntu). The steps and screen shots used for this tutorial are specific to Parallels Desktop 3.0 (Build 4128) running on a Mac Book Pro w/ OS X (10.4.10). With that said, they will be nearly identical if you have a Mac Pro, Mac Mini, Mac Book or any other Intel based Apple Mac. http://www.simplehelp.net/2007/08/15/how-to-install-ubuntu-feisty-fawn-in-os-x-using-parallels-desktop-30-a-complete-walkthrough/

* First Official Compiz Fusion Release! - Compiz Fusion is the result of a merge between the Compiz community plugin set “Compiz Extras” and the window manager core independent parts of the “Beryl” project. Both Compiz Extras and Beryl have left important marks on in how we look at Window management, and with the merge, you no longer have to choose which one to use. The release marks a milestone as our first release and six months since the last release of Beryl. - http://smspillaz.wordpress.com/2007/08/13/compiz-fusion-our-first-release-052/
