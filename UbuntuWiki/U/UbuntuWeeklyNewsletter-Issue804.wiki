==== First Mantic Minotaur test rebuild ====

Graham Inggs informs us the first test rebuild of Mantic Minotaur started on 30 August 2023 for all architectures and components. We're told the main component completed for all architectures except for riscv64, and is still running for universe and multiverse. We're given a link to view superseded builds, and another link for failed builds, with a request to help fixing these failures (currently in mantic-proposed).

==== Thank You for the Passionate Discussion: An Update on Installation Options and Provisioning Overhaul ====

Tim Holmes-Mitra thanks all who contributed to the Ubuntu desktop ISO discussion for their valued input. We're reminded of the purpose: the exploration of combining 'Full' and 'Minimal' installation options into a new default install. Plans for 23.10 have changed and will now include the result of this new default, plus a full install option. It is expected this will 'inform' what maybe best going forward.

https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/thank-you-for-the-passionate-discussion-an-update-on-installation-options-and-provisioning-overhaul/38397

==== [update] Modern Communication Platforms - Call for Feedback ====

Mauro Gaspari thanks all who shared the good and bad of Matrix. Mauro discusses some of the points raised in this thread. Brief mention is made of many participants in the prior thread, and likely plans of action (use of bridges etc), with mention of some who expressed problems and a request to "have specific discussions about those, here in the open". We're told that even if discussions occur elsewhere, updates will be provided here on discourse.

https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/modern-communication-platforms-call-for-feedback/36763/19

==== Web3Lagos Conference Report ====

Bright Adams gives us his experiences from a recent Web3 event, where he promoted Ubuntu, and helped attendees with their installations. Bright sees "significant potential for Ubuntu in Africa", but with a need for "more awareness and education", which leads to Bright's proposal to organize more events like this one. We're given a link to join the Nigeria Lo``Co, along with a number of photos.

==== Xubuntu Development Update September 2023 ====

Sean Davis provides the monthly update of Xubuntu development. Various improvements are covered, including Color Emoji, Bluetooth headphone fixes, the replacement of policykit-1-gnome with a modified mate-polkit (if done perfectly users won't even notice), and a list of package upgrades. We're invited to test these changes by using the Xubuntu 23.10 daily ISOs (links provided for the Desktop or Minimal).

https://blog.bluesabre.org/2023/09/04/xubuntu-development-update-september-2023/

==== Ubuntu at DebConf 2023 ====

Mauro Gaspari starts by reminding us Ubuntu relies on Debian (upstream), which is why Ubuntu is a Gold sponsor of Deb``Conf again this year. We're told who will be hosting some sessions, and what those sessions will cover, and given a link to the Deb``Conf23 web site for more details, and reminded it's being held in Kochi, India.

=== Other Community News ===

==== Ubuntu 23.10 Adding Experimental TPM-Backed Full Disk Encryption ====

Michael Larabel informs us that Canonical is "introducing initial support for TPM-based full disk encryption to make use of your system's Trusted Platform Module (TPM)". Michael tells us this feature relies on snaps, and that "Ubuntu 23.10 will have experimental TPM-backed Full Disk Encryption support" that will complement existing encryption. A quote and link to the official announcement is given.

==== September Plasma 6 update ====

Nate Graham provides a Plasma 6 status update, firstly telling us Plasma 6 will be released early February 2024. We're then walked through some of the porting and feature tasks that have been completed in the past month, which includes a list of developers who did this work. We're told the team is now in stage 4 of the Plasma 6 roadmap, and "nibbling" on stage 5. There are 75 Plasma 6 issues, which is a reduction. Nate extends an invitation for developers to come and help, or end-users to help test the Plasma 6 work.

=== In the Blogosphere ===

==== Linux Fix Incoming For Intel Fallout After The Kernel Disabled Buggy AMD fTPM RNG ====

Michael Larabel writes that the disabling "random number generation (RND) for all AMD fTPMs ended up having unintended consequences on Intel systems" that broke S3 suspend behavior. We're told a fix for this has been submitted into the Linux 6.6 kernel, and is marked for backporting to LTS kernels. We are given a link and details of where it was discovered, plus a link to the patch.

https://www.phoronix.com/news/AMD-fTPM-RNG-Intel-Fix-6.6

==== GNOME 45 Arrives in Daily Builds of Ubuntu 23.10 ====

Joey Sneddon reports GNOME 45 has hit Ubuntu 23.10 dailies. Joey reminds us that GNOME 45 still hasn't been released, thus GNOME on the dailies may change. What we'll see is described, including some screenshots and a GIF, before being reminded when Ubuntu 23.10 will be released.

==== Mesa 23.2-rc3 Released After Five Week Hiatus ====

Michael Larabel reports on Mesa 23.2-rc3 being available for testing. Brief mention of some of the fixes is given, before telling us more RCs are expected before final release later this month.

https://www.phoronix.com/news/Mesa-23.2-rc3-Released

==== Linux Kernel 6.5 is Ready to Install in Ubuntu 22.04 LTS ====

Ji m briefly mentions some of the 'goodies' found in the Linux 6.5 kernel, and tells us the kernel has been packaged for Ubuntu 23.10, and as an OEM kernel for Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. We're briefly told about OEM kernels, and how we can install this kernel on a Ubuntu 22.04 LTS system, and remove it if we wish.

https://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2023/09/linux-kernel-6-5-is-ready-to-install-in-ubuntu-22-04-lts/

==== Ubuntu 23.10 Mascot Art, Default Wallpaper Revealed ====

Joey Sneddon shows us the default wallpaper of Ubuntu 23.10. We're told the designers chose to include the mascot image within a maze, making what Joey describes as "ancient and classic yet modern and dynamic". A link is provided for us to download and use it (and other goodies) today on our systems, or we can view it using the provided image.

https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2023/09/ubuntu-23-10-default-wallpaper-unveiled

==== Brand New ‘App Center’ Lands in Ubuntu 23.10 ====

Joey Sneddon tells us that "Ubuntu's new 'App Center' app has arrived" on daily builds of Ubuntu 23.10. A picture of the app store running is shown to us, and we're told it looks like it belongs. Joey gives his finding that it "feels faster" than the store it replaces, and uses less RAM too. Joey notes it won't let you find & install "repo/deb" software, as it currently only offers snap packages; but this is temporary. Nor is flatpak supported.

==== LibreOffice 7.5.6 Office Suite Released with More Than 50 Bug Fixes ====

Marius Nestor informs us the Document Foundation has released Libre``Office 7.5.6 which resolves 53 bugs/issues. Links are given to the RC changelogs for more details, along with some details of further Libre``Office expected release dates. We are advised to upgrade when we can.

=== In Other News ===

==== Help us make GNOME Calendar rock-solid by expanding the test suite! ====

Jeff Fortin writes that GNOME Calendar 45 is a "groundbreaking release in terms of UX". Jeff mentions some bugs that have existed in GNOME Calendar related to timezones and daylight-savings. To help test these, some unit tests are wanted (there aren't enough currently). Jeff requests help in creating these unit tests. Details on what is required, and how much it will help the project is provided.
