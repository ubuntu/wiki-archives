=== In Other News ===

==== Will Flatpak and Snap replace desktop Linux native apps? ====

Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols, in expressing his opinion in respect to containerization, reminds us of the early days of installing software which was replaced by package managers. We're reminded of the costs with this, which led to the newer containerized package systems and their benefits, and even costs. Next in this 'story' is the joining of GNOME and KDE Foundations in creating a joint store above Flatpak. After some discussion we're given a conclusion that "the future of the Linux desktop is here, and it's going to be containerized".
