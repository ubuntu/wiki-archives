==== Ubuntu 8.10 released ====

The Ubuntu team is pleased to announce the release of Ubuntu 8.10 Desktop and Server. Intrepid Ibex continues Ubuntu's tradition of integrating the latest, and greatest open source technologies into a high-quality, easy-to-use Linux distribution. Ubuntu 8.10 will be supported for 18 months on both desktops and servers. Users requiring a longer support lifetime may choose to continue using Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, rather than upgrading to or installing 8.10. Ubuntu 8.10 is also the basis for new 8.10 releases of Kubuntu, Xubuntu, and Ubuntu``Studio:

* Kubuntu: http://kubuntu.org/news/8.10-release
* Xubuntu: http://xubuntu.org/news/intrepid/release
* Ubuntu``Studio: http://ubuntustudio.org/8-10_release_note

It is recommend that all users read the release notes, which document caveats and workarounds for known issues. They are available at:

* 8.10 release notes: http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes/810

You can find more information on where to download Ubuntu Desktop, or Server editions here:

https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-announce/2008-October/000116.html

==== Ubuntu 8.10 Server: significant new features ====

Ubuntu 8.10 Server Edition will be maintained for 18 months and adds significant enhancements in virtualization, Java development, and system management. This continues the project’s commitment to serve the needs of those users for whom innovation, and performance are vital. The server edition embraces cloud computing, virtualization, mail server enhancements, Java development and deployment, as well as a range of services to help system administrators, and developers. The six-monthly release cycle allows the project to get these features in front of users faster, which in turn helps to make Ubuntu the best option for innovative organizations. http://www.ubuntu.com/news/ubuntu-8.10-server

* Download Ubuntu Server: http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download

==== UDSJaunty ====

* What: Ubuntu Developer Summit for version 9.04
* Where: Google Campus, Mountain View, California, USA
* When: Monday 8th - Friday 12th December 2008
* IRC: #ubuntu-devel-summit

At the beginning of a new development cycle, Ubuntu developers from around the world gather to help shape and scope the next release of Ubuntu. The summit is open to the public, but it is not a conference, exhibition or other audience-oriented event. Rather, it is an opportunity for Ubuntu developers -- who usually collaborate online -- to work together in person on specific tasks.

Small groups of developers will participate in short Forum and Workshops (formerly called "BoF"/Birds-of-a-Feather) sessions. This allows a single project to discuss, and document a written specification. These specifications will then be used for planning the new release of Ubuntu, as described in Feature Specifications[1] and Time Based Releases[2]. Find out more about UDSJaunty, including how to attend, and where to find lodging by clicking on the link. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UDSJaunty

 [2] Time Based Releases: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TimeBasedReleases

==== Ubuntu Open Week ====

Ubuntu Open Week is a week of IRC sessions that are geared toward teaching. Sessions use a Q+A format, and it's all about getting involved in the rock-and-roll world that is the Ubuntu community. It is also a week for organizing the beginning of a new release cycle, and to help new contributors get involved. Jorge has put together a week full of great sessions to help anyone interested in getting involved, and it's going to be a rockin' week!

Ubuntu Open Week is scheduled for Monday, Nov. 3rd - Friday, Nov. 7th in #ubuntu-classroom, on the Freenode IRC network. You can use any IRC client program, such as XChat-GNOME to connect. So, what session topics are on the scheduled? The timetable is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuOpenWeek, along with who's giving the presentations, and more. Everyone will want to mark their calendars now to attend any, or all, of the sessions. Don't miss out!

==== SFD in Tunisia ====

Software Freedom Days in Tunisia was held on October 29th, 2008. It was delayed until this date because of conflicts with Ramadan. The Tunisian Team participated and hosted a booth of about 10 PCs, 2 sun servers, and 5 Sunray's. There was also a conference with the theme, "Ubuntu: the spirit, the OS and the community". The team handed out about 400 CDs, gave talks, hosted workshops, and sponsored an install party. The article, in French, can be found at http://rafiiik.blogspot.com/2008/11/rsultat-de-la-journe-du-logiciel-libre.html

=== Launchpad News ===

==== Launchpad EPIC ====

What do you get when you bring together a group of developers, QA engineers and other Launchpad team members? Cheesy photos, of course! They came by air, and by land to meet in London for a couple of weeks at what they’re calling the Launchpad EPIC. It’s was a rare chance to get the full Launchpad team together for planning, training and, of course, unrepentant bad dancing. You can see the "Not so Cheesy" picture at: http://news.launchpad.net/

=== Ubuntu Forums News ===

==== Over 6 Million Forum posts and counting ====

The forums continue to grow and be a vital part of the Ubuntu Community. Most of us have, at one time or another, hunted for answers, or provided some technical support to the community through the forums. In fact, it's likely that most active community members got their start with Ubuntu by using or working the forums. Recently, stats show that over 6 million posts have been made to the forums, and they are closing in on 1 million threads. Like all the projects in the Ubuntu community, the forums are driven by people who care, and are committed to volunteering their time and effort to make it the best. Thanks to everyone involved, and congratulations on breaking the 6 million post mark!

=== Ubuntu Sighting ===

Intrepid Ibex on Berliner Fenster - Mathias Hasselmann tells us about the Berlin subway cars being equipped with LCD screens showing news, headlines, event tips, and advertising. He was recently surprised to see a very familiar wallpaper, and an advertisement for Intrepid Ibex. If you've seen Ubuntu in a place you wouldn't have expected, take a picture, and let the Ubuntu Weekly News know by emailing our list at: ubuntu-news-team@lists.ubuntu.com We would be happy to include your sighting of Ubuntu from around the world.

=== In The Press ===

* Shuttleworth: Canonical may need 3-5 more years of funding - Chris Kanaracus of IDG News Service, reporting on a teleconference with Mark Shuttleworth, notes that Mark is willing to continue supporting Canonical for the next 3 to 5 years.  He adds that it may not take that long for the commercial side of Ubuntu to operate in the black due to the present world economic climate. Looking forward from Ubuntu 8.10, Mark suggests that there are 3 trends that Ubuntu will follow: Touch based interactivity, 3-D imagery and the integration of Web-like features on the desktop. http://www.linuxworld.com/news/2008/102708-shuttleworth-canonical-may-need-3-5.html?fsrc=rss-linux-news

* WORLD FIRST review of Inspiron Mini 12: Dell’s super-slim netbook! - David Flynn went for a cup of coffee during a conference in Shanghai, and ended up getting a first hand look at the upcoming Dell Mini 12. Compared to the Mini 9, the Mini 12 has a larger screen, and a keyboard that is more like a normal keyboard. Also, where the Mini 9 only had a Solid State Drive, the Mini 12 has a regular hard drive of 60GB (80GB in Australia). The Mini 12 is slated to come with Windows Vista Home Edition, with the possibility of Windows XP and Ubuntu in the future.  http://apcmag.com/scoop_we_review_the_inspiron_mini_12__dells_supersized_yet_superslim_12_inch_netbook.htm

* Ubuntu Linux: 8 Million Users and Growing - Sean Michael Kerner reports that the number of Ubuntu users, according to Chris Kenyon, director of business development at Canonical, is 8 million. This compares very favorably to Fedora with 1.2 million reported for Fedora 9, and more than 2 million (in 2007) for Fedora 6. It also compares favorably to Red Hat with over 2.5 million paid subscriptions to Red Hat Enterprise Linux. http://www.internetnews.com/software/article.php/3780651

* Editor's Note: Does Linux Deliver For Small Businesses? - Carla Schroder reports for Linux Today that Linux fills many niche rolls, and has a lot to offer small businesses, too. Much of that she attributes to Canonical and Ubuntu. There are some drawbacks however - such as the lack of visibility and support for Linux, and the need for some specialized Windows or Mac-centric software. Despite that, Carla feels that Linux is "good enough" for small businesses. http://www.linuxtoday.com/it_management/2008103103235OPBZCY

* Review: Ubuntu 8.10 Is The Real Deal - Edward F. Moltzen outlines a number of improvements in Ubuntu 8.10, over Ubuntu 8.04, and include wireless connectivity. He also mentions the continued bundling of applications like Open``Office.org, Rhythmbox, Firefox and GIMP. The bottom line however, is that Ubuntu 8.10 Desktop Edition is not just an alternative to Windows, but a strong OS in its own right. http://www.crn.com/software/211800390

* Ubuntu 8.10 Charges Up the Mountain - Justin Ryan reviews Intrepid Ibex, and relates to us a number of problems, and changes with the new distribution. Among the issues are some problems with certain NVidia cards, and a Totem plugin for BBC content. A number of these problems are documented in the Release Notes[1], and system requirements are available from the Ubuntu Documentation Site [2].

* Ubuntu quality: or, “but what about my bug?” - Quality in software is an ever-increasing condition, and this article focuses on that problem, and the tools used to address it. First on the list is people to review the bugs, with the Ubuntu bug squad as a focal point, and the 5-a-day program as a good way to get started. The QA Team adds such tools as the package status pages, regression tracker, and release management weather report. More detail is given at http://www.e-linux.it/news_detail.php?id=6809

* Ubuntu 8.10 is here! - Neil Bothwick says that there isn't a great deal of difference between Ubuntu 8.04, and Ubuntu 8.10. This is mostly due to the distribution having matured to the point where changes are more incremental. He did note however, that there were some major improvements. Among them are a new kernel (2.6.27), X.Org (7.4) and KDE (4.1.2). Also highlighted were the number of different download options, including 32 bit and 64 bit desktop and server editions, and the new Mobile USB image option. Neil goes on to outline his experience with installing Ubuntu 8.10, at http://linuxformat.co.uk/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=759&mode=thread&order=0&thold=0

* Ubuntu 8.10: A Positive Evolution - Adrianot has had Ubuntu 8.10 installed on his computer for over two weeks now. The tests began with the beta version, and continued through RC. Now that he has tried the final release, he's not disappointed. Network``Manager supports 3G, Nautilus is equipped with tab support, the new guest account feature is great, encrypted file in home directory, new theme, and the upgrade which has been problematic in the past was a breeze. In his opinion, the decision to focus on the evolution, and bug fixes, instead of stuffing too many (often unstable) packages into this release of Ubuntu, is a correct one. http://polishlinux.org/linux/ubuntu/ubuntu-810-a-positive-evolution/

=== In The Blogosphere ===

* A User's Look at Ubuntu 8.10 Intrepid Ibex - Keir Thomas, who has been reviewing and writing books on Linux for years, looks at Ubuntu 8.10 as if he were new to Linux. In a detailed article, complete with various screen-shots and graphics, he outlines what he sees as improvements, and/or updates to previous releases of Ubuntu. His bottom-line conclusion is that while there are some glitches with Intrepid Ibex, it is a good release, and a month's wait will probably eliminate most of the problems. http://lifehacker.com/5072351/a-users-look-at-ubuntu-810-intrepid-ibex

* Ubuntu 8.10, The Intrepid Ibex - Linux is ready for prime time! - Brett Martin has some very nice things to say about Ubuntu and about his new installation of Intrepid Ibex. Having used Ubuntu 8.04 as his main OS for the past 4 months, he's found the difference between it, and the new 8.10 version, to be a refreshing experience. An example, is the ability of 8.10 to handle an AT&T 3G network, then hand off seamlessly between a Wi``Fi hotspot, and the wireless network. http://itchannelcast.com/blog1/2008/10/31/ubuntu-810-the-intrepid-ibex-linux-is-ready-for-prime-time/

* Get Set... (Ubuntu Intrepid Ibex) - J.A. Watson tells us that while the release of Intrepid Ibex is not focused exclusively on improvements to mobile computing, that is where he uses it the most. He highlights Intrepid's support for Mobile Broadband connections (3G cellular modems) as something that is crucial to him. Getting wireless networking connections to work is now easier than ever. Improved video display support when working with multiple displays has improved, and has allowed Watson to use both his laptop display and a separate attached display at the same time. These, and other improvements have resulted in Watson being able to use his laptops with Ubuntu anywhere at any time. He no longer has to boot into Windows for his twice daily commute. He commends Canonical for doing an excellent job with this release. http://community.zdnet.co.uk/blog/0,1000000567,10009643o-2000498448b,00.htm

==== New TurnKey Linux release ====

In issue #108, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuWeeklyNewsletter/Issue108, we reported on a new Ubuntu based project code-named Turn``Key Linux. The motto of Turn``Key is "everything that can be easy, should be easy". In short, the project is trying to make certain tasks, mostly server oriented, easier for the everyday user. In response to that article, it seems the Ubuntu community pitched in to help out. As a result, the project is happy to announce that their latest version of LAMP, Joomla, and Drupal appliances now feature:

* an easy to use configuration console (written from scratch in Python)
* a beautiful web management interface (Mac OS X themed)
* auto-login while in demo/live mode
* root password configuration during installation

Detailed information, screen shots, and release notes are available in the appliances section of their website: http://www.turnkeylinux.org/appliances

Launchpad blueprints for this release can be found at: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/turnkeylinux/2008.10.17-hardy-x86

==== Release week for Ubuntu and CohesiveFT ====

This week, Ubuntu released the latest version of its operating system, 8.10 (aka Intrepid Ibex). In an unsurprising twist, the CohesiveFT team is delivering their own Ubuntu bundles of joy, available now in the Elastic Server factory! Elastic Servers are custom application stacks, built from components, virtualization-ready, that you can download to test, or deploy to a cloud. The Community Version of Elastic Server is also free: http://cohesiveft.com/community/

Initial Elastic Server support for Ubuntu comes in the form of the Hardy Heron 8.04 LTS version for 32-bit, and includes Amazon EC2 small, on the most popular bundles in the Elastic Server factory. To quickly locate Ubuntu-ready bundles, go to the Bundle Explorer, and search for the tag, Ubuntu 8_04LTS. This tag indicates that the specific bundle has been tested and approved for use on your Elastic Server. http://es.cohesiveft.com/bundle-explorer

Elastic Server gives you the freedom to choose the components you want from their library of horizontal, open source, and third-party software components. Don't like those? Upload your own components with their Build-Your-Own (BYO) option (here's how): http://www.cohesiveft.com/Elastic_Server/Main/CohesiveFT_FAQ/#addbundles
