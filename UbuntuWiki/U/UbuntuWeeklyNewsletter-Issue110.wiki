=== General Community News ===

==== Potential hardware-damaging e1000e driver: Intrepid ====

Reports have been coming in that the e1000e ethernet driver for Intel GigE chipsets, as included upstream in Linux 2.6.27, may under certain conditions irreparably damage your ethernet hardware by corrupting the on-board firmware. Alpha releases are expected to have a fair number of bugs, but bugs that damage hardware is another matter. As a result of this bug we must recommend that users do *not* use Intrepid alphas, including the LiveCDs, on machines with Intel GigE ethernet.

Efforts to safeguard the hardware of affected users are ongoing, though initially this will consist of a workaround in the form of disabling the e1000e driver.  Alpha 6 CD images will not be re-issued for this fix, so affected users are advised to either use daily CD images once a resolution is in place, or to wait for the release of the 8.10 beta, due to be released on October 2nd. Further discussion of this issue can be found on the ubuntu-devel mailing list at: https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2008-September/026559.html, and progress on resolving this issue can be tracked at: https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/263555.

==== Ubuntu 8.10 beta freeze now in effect ====

In preparation for the Beta release of Ubuntu 8.10, a freeze is now in effect.  All uploads to main must go through a member of the release team.[1]  Uploads to universe can be manually pushed through the queue without release team approval. Issues which are important for the beta release will be tracked by the
release team.[2]

==== Ubuntu 8.10 beta approaching ====

Ubuntu 8.10, Intrepid Ibex Beta is scheduled to be released Thursday, October 2nd, 2008.  There are milestone bug items remaining[1] that need to be cleaned up.  There are also bugs that affect the release as a whole.[2] It is also important to address inconsistencies in archiving, such as uninstallable packages in main and restricted[3] and undeclared Replaces or Conflicts.[4]

==== Ubuntu 7.04 reaches end-of-life on October 19, 2008 ====

Ubuntu announced the release of 7.04 almost 18 months ago, on April 19th, 2007. As with the earlier releases, Ubuntu committed to ongoing security and critical fixes for a period of 18 months. The support period for 7.04 is now nearing its end-of-life date. On Sunday, October 19th, 2008, Ubuntu security notices will no longer include information, or updated packages for Ubuntu 7.04. The supported upgrade path is to version 7.10. Those wishing to upgrade to 8.04 must first upgrade to 7.10, then again to 8.04. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GutsyUpgrades.

https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-announce/2008-September/000113.html

==== Intrepid Release Parties! ====

Ubuntu will be 4 years old with the release of Intrepid Ibex. What better time to throw a party than to combine the release with a birthday bash? Organizing a party is pretty simple:

* Pick a date: It is recommended that it be either Thursday, October 30th, or the following weekend, Nov. 1st or 2nd.
* Pick a venue: This can be someone’s back yard, a pub, a university room, a school, etc. The key thing is not the venue, it is the people.
* Add your party to the list: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/IntrepidReleaseParties
* Let the world know: Blog about it, make up some fliers, and put them in computers shops, libraries, cafes, educational establishments, etc.

A more detailed guide to organizing a release party can be found at: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BuildingCommunity/RunningReleaseParty. Be sure to include your release party on the master list at: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/IntrepidReleaseParties. The important thing is to get organized, have fun, and help make the release of Intrepid Ibex a success in your community.

==== Ubuntu Upstream Report ====

The upstream report at: https://edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+upstreamreport, is now in shape for people to use for bug work. The upstream report is a real-time list of the Top 100 projects in Ubuntu, sorted by open bugs. It provides information such as how many of those bugs are triaged, how many have an upstream task associated to them, and how well those bugs are being linked to an upstream bug tracker. Report users are encouraged to contact Jorge Castro with feedback concerning better measurement of bug linkages, and any other details. More information at the link.

https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2008-September/026573.html

==== Ubuntu Server survey launched ====

The Server Team wants to know: Where does Ubuntu Server fit into your IT environment? Members of the Server team devised a set of questions to better understand where and why you are using Ubuntu Server to support your IT infrastructure. Completing the survey, http://survey.ubuntu.com/, takes around 20 minutes and topics such as hardware, virtualization and system integration are covered. The survey will help prioritize feature requests, guide partnerships when choosing new technologies and provide input for the next Ubuntu Developer Summit in December 2008. Make your voice heard, shape the future of Ubuntu Server, take the survey!

==== Introducing the Ubuntu Wanted project ====

The purpose of the Ubuntu Wanted Project is to provide a place for projects, and potential contributors to find each other. Brainstorm provides the ideas, with launchpad, and development toolsets providing the means. What is needed are people to man the projects, and the Ubuntu Wanted Project is intended to serve that purpose. Like most projects, this one needs some help, including PHP and SQL skills. To contact Sense Hofstede (Qense), go to the #ubuntu-website or email the Ubuntu Website mailing list. https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-website

==== Progress of Romanian Translation Team ====

The Romanian Translation Team has now set up a wiki section that include a translation guide, a starter guide, and various templates for emails.  Currently, they are involved in translating the Ubuntu Desktop Course, which is a slow process.  They have also reorganized the localization forum from the Romanian Ubuntu Forum, and are continuing work on GNOME packages, passing translations upstream to the coordinator of the GNOME Romanian translation team.

==== Regular Bug Jams in Berlin kicked off! ====

Daniel Holbach reports on the first of what is to become regularly Bug Jams for Berlin. About 15 people showed up, most of them were very new to bug triage, but there was plenty of information available for them to be able to understand how to get started. They also set up 5-A-Day in PPA for everyone. Being a first time event, there was a learning curve for those new to working with bugs, including organization, such as having a list of bugs ready, and rearranging tables to seat people in work groups. Most importantly though:

* They had lots of fun.
* There was lots of interest in Upstreaming Bugs.
* They have active 5-A-Dayers in the Ubuntu Berlin team now.
* Everybody left very excited

==== ABLEconf co-hosted by Ubuntu Arizona LoCo ====

On September 20th, the Arizona Lo``Co team in cooperation with the user groups in the state co-hosted an open source conference in Phoenix. It was a first try at coordinating an event with all the state user groups, and according to those who attended, it was a big success. The idea was two fold, unite the user groups, and advocate for open source computing in Arizona. Members of the team made 3 of the 21 presentations at the conference, and worked at the team booth. Special thanks to all the user groups that participated in this kickoff event for open source conferences in Arizona. For a detailed summary of the event including lots of pictures, please visit the link. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArizonaTeam/OpenSourceConference

=== In The Press ===

* Ubuntu 8.10 "Intrepid Ibex" (Alpha 6): first impressions  -  Hamish Taylor, reporting for ITWire, has written about Intrepid Ibex Alpha, and now he has gone on to actually try it. He was expecting it to still be buggy, being an Alpha, but was pleased to actually be able to use it to write his report. Hamish was also surprised to noticed that Intrepid was faster than Hardy Heron, he also noticed improvements in individual packages like Gedit, and Nautilus. http://www.itwire.com/content/view/20793/1162/

* Who’s Running Ubuntu: The Works With U 1000 - Joe Panettieri reports that Works With U has now obtained 230 entries of people and companies running Ubuntu on business servers, desktops and mobile systems. Shortly, they will be sorting the entries by vertical market, region, etc. This is an update from previous posts concerning the Works With U 1000. http://www.workswithu.com/2008/09/24/whos-running-ubuntu-the-works-with-u-1000/

* Toshiba NB100 netbook announced for the UK - Amy-Mae Elliott for Pocket-lint reports that Toshiba has come out with a new mini.  Sporting a 1.6GHz Intel Atom CPU, 8.9 inch 1024 X 600 display, Wi-Fi and Ethernet port, and 3 USB ports, the NB100 is entering the growing netbook market. The unit can either be equipped with Ubuntu 8.04 and Open``Office 2.4 or Microsoft Windows XP Home Edition. http://www.pocket-lint.co.uk/news/news.phtml/17730/18754/toshiba-nb100-netbook-uk.phtml

=== In The Blogosphere ===

* The Validity Of 5-A-Day - Jono Bacon, who is the Ubuntu Community Manager for Canonical, responds to the Ubuntu UK podcast's debate about the 5-A-Day goal for bug triaging. 5-A-Day isn't necessarily for everyone, and at the moment a relatively low number of people are participating in 5-A-Day. Despite the low number of participants, in the past seven months the 5-A-Day team is responsible for having touched over 14,000 bugs, and thanks to the 5-A-Day team's efforts more than 8,000 bugs have been closed. 5-A-Day team membership fluctuates, and Jono gives a list of excellent educational resources available to those interested in joining the 5-A-Day team. The 5-A-Day team is making an excellent contribution to the Ubuntu community, and anyone with the skills to join in is encouraged to do so. http://www.jonobacon.org/?p=1307

* 5 Things That Make Linux Great - Ken Hess, a Dani``Web Staff Writer/Blogger, reports on five aspects that he feels are compelling reasons for running Linux. His list points out to Linux newcomers that Linux is free, stable, and offers high quality software such as Open``Office.org. These factors, combined with the fact that Linux will work well on older systems, make a compelling argument for those unfamiliar with Linux to give it a try. Hess suggests if you're a beginner to Linux operating systems, and want to try it out, you should look at Ubuntu. http://www.daniweb.com/blogs/entry3248.html

* Ubuntu alpha hits a snag - Christina Warren of the download squad blog comments on a serious bug found in 8.10 alpha. "In some circumstances it appears possible for the 2.6.27-rc kernels to corrupt the NVRAM used by some Intel network parts to store data such as MAC addresses. This is limited to the new e1000e driver, and reports have only appeared from users of "82566 and 82567 based LAN parts (ich8 and ich9)" (to quote Intel)". So far only laptops are effected, but it is not fully understood whether desktops or servers are vulnerable as well. The e1000e driver in the latest kernel release candidate may potentially corrupt NVRAM in Intel 82566 (ich8) and 82567 (ich9) chipsets. This could potentially damage hardware. In some cases a BIOS update has resurrected hardware, but often the hardware needs to be replaced. Christina reports that there is some debate as to whether the alpha release should be removed from the download site. Risks are associated with running alpha software, though in the overwhelming majority of cases, that risk is to software and data, not hardware. To make matters worse, this is hardware integrated into the motherboard of a laptop. Christina recommends removing the download and driver, and release a program to identify if a potential user's system has effected hardware.  http://www.downloadsquad.com/2008/09/26/ubuntu-alpha-hits-a-snag/

* Ubuntu, KDE 3.5, the Mac Mini, and the Future - The author of the RFD Networks blog comments on Ubuntu and the sickness that he shares with many in the Open Source community. Though there are a couple of frustrations with running "Ubuntu flavored Gnome" it has become a very stable system, so much so that the author is bored. He comments, "I am simply bored with getting my work done and not fighting with my computer. It is a sickness, I know". In an effort to overcome the boredom, he has installed the packages required to run the KDE desktop, and was happy to immediately run into the number key issue immediately. The author feels that Ubuntu is certainly ready to be the sole OS for the average home user, though in his case the desire to tinker with the OS superseded his desire for a 100% stable system. http://rfdlinux.wordpress.com/2008/09/27/ubuntu-kde-35-the-mac-mini-and-the-future/

==== Review: Xubuntu 8.10 'Intrepid Ibex' Alpha 6 ====

In this report, Andrew examines Xubuntu 8.10 Alpha 6 from the gamers point of view. This is one of a number of reports Andrew has been doing on distributions, which include Ubuntu 8.10 Alpha 2, Mandriva 2009 Beta 1 (KDE4.1), Ubuntu 8.10 Alpha 4, Kubuntu 8.10 Alpha 4 and Kubuntu 8.10 Alpha 6. He identifies his equipment, then goes into installation and what's available directly from the repositories. His feeling is that, for older equipment, Xubuntu is the way to go.
