The Ubuntu Hams Team exists to bring together Amateur Radio Operators and developers of Amateur Radio packages who use Ubuntu to:

* Provide a meeting place for Amateur Radio Operators using Ubuntu Linux
* Promote Amateur Radio as an enjoyable hobby for all interested people
* Promote and help each other use Amateur Radio applications on Ubuntu Linux
* Organize and collaborate on the development, packaging and maintenance where needed for Amateur Radio applications, both in Ubuntu Linux and upstream.
* Help provide documentation for Linux APIs, i.e. for sound interfaces
* Allow experienced Ubuntu users and the bug handling community to help process bugs reported against Amateur Radio apps running on Ubuntu
* Connect application users with upstream teams in order to facilitate testing
* And more!

We hang out on IRC in <nowiki>[[irc:--irc.libera.chat-ubuntu-hams|#ubuntu-hams]]</nowiki> on irc.libera.chat

=== How to get the latest updates to Ubuntu ham packages ===

The Ubuntu-hams team maintains a PPA with updated versions of a number of ham packages, which are scheduled to appear in future versions of Ubuntu. The team tests these packages, and in most cases it is desirable for hams using Ubuntu to subscribe to this PPA.

If you are having problems with a package in Ubuntu and there is a more recent version in the PPA, please try the PPA version before filing a bug.

<nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-hams-updates/+archive/ppa||Ubuntu Amateur Radio Software Updates]]</nowiki>

=== General Ham Radio information ===

* <nowiki>[[http://www.qsl.net/oh2mcn/license.htm|Worldwide Information on Licensing for Radio Amateurs by OH2MCN]]</nowiki>

The Launchpad page for the team is here:

https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-hams

{i} '''Please join the Launchpad team and also the associated mailing list.'''

=== How To Join ===
# Join the team on the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-hams|Launchpad Team Page]]</nowiki>

Once you are done with these steps, you can order a slick Ubuntu Hams callsign badge as described below:

=== Expected courtesies on the mailing list and IRC ===

The ubuntu-hams community strives to be a collaborative community open to people with all levels of experience and knowledge, consistent with the greater Ubuntu community.

Any question of what is and is not appropriate content for the mailing list and chat room must be addressed in those public channels or in private communications with the admins. Critical personal responses (via off-list email or private chat) are inappropriate.

Use the <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/about/about-ubuntu/conduct|Ubuntu Code of Conduct]]</nowiki> as your guide.

In a situation where there is a question or comment that may not belong on the list, or an individual receives off-list communication which diminishes their contributions in any way, please contact one of the administrators as listed on the ubuntu-hams launchpad page.  We will review it and take appropriate action.

=== Team Badges ===
After completing the steps above, you are eligible to order your very own Ubuntu Hams callsign badge from <nowiki>[[http://thesignman.com/clubs/ubuntucart.html|here]]</nowiki>.
