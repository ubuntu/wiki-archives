==== Recap ====
The event was a load of fun and the participants were all pro-foss. The most interesting event of the day was Lockpick Village that included a lock picking challenge that included four locks and a blow up doll. The event was a success for FOSS with a Fedora employee being the first to complete all four locks. Not to be outdone cprofitt took the challenge and defeated all four locks and the dreaded blow up doll captor in 80 seconds. That time was the best of the day at 4:00pm and bested the time of the 'expert' by two seconds.
