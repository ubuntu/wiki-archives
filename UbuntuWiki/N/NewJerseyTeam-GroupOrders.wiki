__TOC__

== Description ==

Several members of the New Jersey and Pennsylvania Ubuntu Local
Communities are organising a bulk purchases of items from the <nowiki>[[http://shop.canonical.com|Canonical Store]]</nowiki> to reduce individual shipping costs. We invite you to join us
and share in the reduced costs by following the plan laid out below.

== The Plan ==
Go to the Canonical Shop and login using your Launchpad account
(this changes the prices to reflect the 15% discount we'll receive). Add
the items you want to your cart. When you're done, view your cart and
copy the contents of into the bottom of this wiki page. Add your
name and email address to the page. You may obfuscate your email address against spam harvesting; just make sure real people can figure it out.  See the example below for how your order
should look. 

Within 36 hours, you'll receive a confirmation from Dave
Harding (see contact info below) that he has your order. If you change
anything, you'll receive another confirmation. Please DO NOT edit anyone
else's list or change your order after the order submission deadline (see Deadlines table below).

 '''Example'''
 <pre>
Jane Doe -- jane@example.com
4	Gutsy Gibbon Mens T-shirt - Small
		$ 82.89

1	Ballpoint Pen
		$ 1.38

Sub-Total: $ 84.27
</pre>

Once the order-placing deadline has past (see deadline table
below), Harding will enter the combined order, calculate your
share of the shipping charges, and send you a bill. Shipping
charges will be distributed based on the dollar value of your
order. An example is below.

        '''Example'''

        Three people order. Abby's order is for $25, Brian's order is
        for $25, and Cordelia's order is for $50. Abby pays 25% of the
        shipping charges, Brian pays 25%, and Cordelia pays 50%.

|}

There will be a small surcharge to cover the cost of people who
fail to pay (which increases the relative shipping charges for everyone
else), to cover changes in the exchange rate between when the order
is entered and when its placed, and to cover Harding's PayPal fees. The unused part of the surcharge will
either be given back to you when you pick up your stuff or, with your
consent, it will be given to your State LoCo team.

Information on whom to pay is stored on the <nowiki>[[http://nj.ubuntu-us.org/files/payment-info.txt.asc|official New Jersey Ubuntu LoCo website]]</nowiki>. For expediency's sake, we ask you pay your bill using
PayPal. If that's not acceptable, Harding will accept personal checks or
U.S. Postal Service money orders, but you must email Harding in advance
(see Contact Information table below).

''FOR SECURITY'', please only send money to the accounts <nowiki>[[http://nj.ubuntu-us.org/files/payment-info.txt.asc|listed on the New Jersey Ubuntu LoCo website]]</nowiki>.  Anyone can edit this wiki or forge email
headers, and any information you receive from the wiki or email is suspect.
If you have any questions or concerns, please direct email to your
LoCo's leaders; they'll be able to provide you with the correct
information.

Once your payment is received, Harding will send you a confirmation
notice.  The order will be placed on the date in the deadline table
below.

Shortly after the shipment arrives at Harding's house, you will receive
an email notifying you of the dates and times you can pick up your
stuff. The locations are described in the Pick Up Locations table below.
Please respond to the email and tell Harding at which date and location
you'll pick up your stuff. You may also arrange with Harding a time to
pick up the stuff at his house, but be aware, he lives far from
civilisation in a place believed to be the inspiration for certain
scenes from the movie Deliverance. If you go, beware of dueling banjos.

Unless you're absolutely sure Harding knows who you are, please bring
state-issued identification to the pick-up location.

If you don't pick up the stuff within three months, it will
automatically be transferred to the possession of your state LoCo team
to be distributed as give-aways. Harding must approve, in writing or
email, any exceptions to this rule.

=== Pick Up Locations ===
* Philadelphia LUG Central
* LUG in Princeton
* Cherry Hill LUG
* Rutgers University Student LUG  (may be on winter break when the order arrives)
* Major NJ or Philadelphia-area LoCo events (depending on when the order arrives)

=== Contract Terms ===
The bill Harding sends you is a contract that will include the following
two CONDITIONS:

 1. You will not hold David A. Harding, Elizabeth Bevilacqua, Jim Fisher, Joe Terranova, or the New Jersey or Pennsylvania Local Communities responsible for the lose of, or damage to, your property or money resulting from their good faith efforts in fulfilling this order.

 1. You must retrieve your property from Harding within three months after he notifies you its available. If you fail to do so, possession of the property will be automatically transfered to a representative of the Ubuntu Local Community in your State.

'''Explanations:'''

 1. You can, of course, still hold me responsible if I act in bad faith. I just don't want to be, for example, sued if Canonical fails to deliver and refuses to refund the money.

 1. I have enough junk in my house without having to hold on to your stuff forever. :-)

=== Shipping Costs ===
Over a certain weight, which we'll probably exceed, the only available
shipping choices are UPS Express and UPS Expedited. The cheaper option,
UPS Express, is hideously expensive for small orders, but is cheaper (as
a percentage of total price) for large orders. For example, an $85 order
pays $24 (22% shipping costs) for Registered Surface Mail, but a $650
order pays $110 (14% shipping costs) for UPS Express, and we get the
order much quicker.

My guarantee: before billing you, I'll investigate whether splitting the
order into pieces will result in lower shipping charges.
