== About me ==
I'm Navid, born in 1981. I consider myself a industrial engineer because of my tendency to optimize anything that comes on my way, I just can't help it. I earned my B.S. from Yazd University and since I hate the university so much I managed to get on with my studies in IT management. I love anything related to computer and learning languages, anything new amuses me beyond imagination. I'm also a Linux enthusiast. My favourite flavor is Gentoo but I also admire Ubuntu (actually Kubuntu cause I'm a KDE fan).
