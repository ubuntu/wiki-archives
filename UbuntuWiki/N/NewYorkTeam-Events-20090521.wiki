=== Topic ===
Virtualization Event (Joint event with Lugor)

<nowiki>[[http://www.smp-corp.com/|Systems Management Planning]]</nowiki> will do a presentation on virtualization.

'''More Detail''':<<BR>>
Would you like to reduce your hardware and IT operations costs as well as your total cost of ownership? Fully utilize your server capacity, deploy new servers efficiently, and manage your server resources strategically? If so then you should consider using virtualization.

'''How Does Virtualization Work?'''

The VMware virtualization platform is built on a business-ready architecture.    VMware to transforms or “virtualizes” the hardware resources of an x86-based computer—including the CPU, RAM, hard disk and network controller—to create a fully functional virtual machinethat can run its own operating system and applications just like a “real” computer.  Each virtual machine contains a complete system, eliminating potential conflicts.     VMware virtualization works by inserting a thin layer of software directly on the computer hardware or on a host operating system. This contains a virtual machine monitor or “hypervisor” that allocates hardware resources dynamically and transparently.   Multiple operating systems run concurrently on a single physical computer and share hardware resources with each other. By encapsulating an entire machine, including CPU, memory, operating system, and network devices, a virtual machine is completely compatible with all standard x86 operating systems, applications, and device drivers. You can safely run several operating systems and applications at the same time on a single computer, with each having access to the resources it needs when it needs them.

 

'''vSphere – the foundation for Cloud Computing?'''

A cloud operating system is a new category of software that is specifically designed to holistically manage large collections of infrastructure – CPUs, storage, networking – as a seamless, flexible and dynamic operating environment. 

Analogous to the operating system that manages the complexity of an individual machine, the cloud operating system manages the complexity of a datacenter.  Although alternative approaches may be pursued, VMware believes that virtualization is the key underpinning technology to enable the cloud.
