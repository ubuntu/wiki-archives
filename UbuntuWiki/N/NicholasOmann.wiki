=== About Me ===

My name is Nicholas Omann, and I have been an Ubuntu user off an on for 2 years.  I am a student at Bemidji State University in Minnesota, I am a  Computer Science major and History Minor. Ubuntu was my 2nd taste of GNU/Linux after trying Fedora to utter failure I feel in love with Ubuntu.  I have not been using Windows now other then for CS assignments which require it for the last year. Since upgrading my desktop I have only been running Ubuntu only on my laptop as my Desktop now has a Radeon 3850 because of the fact that the radeonHD driver still doesn't support it.

=== Ubuntu Community ===
I help out in #ubuntu-us-mn and am a part of the Minnesota LoCo Team and hoping to sometime start helping with Exaile again.
