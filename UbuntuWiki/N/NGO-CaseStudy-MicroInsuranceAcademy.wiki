__TOC__


IN PROGRESS

== Introduction ==
Out transition to FLOSS is under-way.  

== Started Projects ==
* CiviCRM - Moving to from proprietary contact system (hosted externally)
* dotProject - Moving to from Excel spreadsheets (hosted externally)

=== Ubuntu ===
Currently rolling out to pilot/new users (we are expanding right now). 

'''How we deployed/customized'''

Each time we want to make a new LiveCD version, using Ubuntu Customization Kit (UCK)

* Run UCK and do simple language removal, tell it to prompt for manual customizations
* Copy over customize script and MIA-custom.deb
* Run customize script (which customize just the installed software and install MIA-custom.deb)
* MIA-custom.deb - Adds our customization, including specific fonts, customized gconf values, proxy values, Desktop icons, openoffice templates, smb.conf, etc.  Installed manually in Ubuntu Customization Kit

More when I blog about MIA-custom.deb.

'''Issues / Bugs'''

* Virtual desktops cause users to "lose" applications
* Desktop becomes cluttered with network drives (can turn off in gconf)
* Need more space in Fast User Switcher Applet, users can easily try to click the applet instead of an X to close a program and then they will likely end up switching users
* Thunderbird drag and drop fails https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/thunderbird/+bug/151162 

=== OpenOffice.org ===
We have deployed OpenOffice in parallel with MSO.
Blogged (http://gquigs.blogspot.com/2009/06/going-to-openoffice-step-1-unfreezing.html)

'''How We Deployed (on Windows)'''

Used an extension to preload templates, had to manually set them to be the default though.
Deployed 3.1.0.  

'''Bugs holding us back'''

http://qa.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=75498
Spellcheck issues (to be investigated more) - on both Ubuntu and Windows, but might be different underlying cause

'''Suggestions (for OpenOffice)'''
* Preload landscape as a page style (workaround for windows, put it in your template)
* Let the mail merge use the default mail client (not do it directly) 

'''Next Steps'''

* Survey partners on their office suites/ODF support possibilities. (IN PROGRESS)
* Update Templates

== Future Projects ==
* Claims Management System for health insurance
* GIS system
* "Virtual Library"

== General Case Study Guidelines ==
'''Summary''' ''(100 words approx.) 

'''Challenge or situation''' ''(250 words approx.) 

'''Solution''' ''(250 words approx.) 

'''Benefits – with subheadings''' ''(400 words approx.) 

== Interview Questions ==
* What is the mission of your organisation?
Training community-based micro health insurance schemes in insurance domain knowledge.
* Can you give us a few examples of what you have done? Maybe you have some pictures you can share?
* '''Other Software'''
** Did you also use other linux distros?
** Did you also use proprietary software?
** In this case, what feature do you think is missing in Ubuntu that forced you to choose proprietary software?
* '''Suggestions'''
** What do you suggest should be done in Ubuntu to better match your needs?
** What would you like to see improved in Ubuntu resources like documentation?
* '''Experiences'''
** What is the biggest difficulty you encountered with Ubuntu?
** and what do you think is the best trick you learned along the way?
** What would you suggest to our readers that are interested in an initiative like yours?
** How can interested readers help your organisation?
* ''' Photos and stories'''
** Collect few photos of the initiative
** Ask if there's particular anecdotes, good or funny stories, best lessons that reporter would like to tell to the world.
