Hola Amigos! Our very own Jonathan "Kubuntu" Riddell was in attendance along with
Mark Shuttleworth.  By all accounts everyone was busy loving Kubuntu,
you can see the latin spirit at work in the photo of various people enjoying themselves.  http://conference2005.kde.org/

<nowiki>[[http://www.kubuntu.org/|Kubuntu]]</nowiki> is for everyone who prefers KDE and
designed to be the best desktop based on the Qt/KDE toolkits and
environment.  Along the idea and nickname of 'Kubuntu' has been waved
about for about a year, things really started happening at the Ubuntu
conference in Mataro, just north of Barcelona in Spain.  Since then,
there then work has accelerated with the movement of large parts of
high-quality KDE code into the '`main`' repository, signifying the
official parity of support status followed by the pressing of CDs and
the 5.04 release of Kubuntu onto the world.

Kubuntu has been holding a steady 11th place on the
<nowiki>[[http://www.distrowatch.com/|Distrowatch]]</nowiki> ranking, although this maybe
lower than the true reflection---over the weekend of the 5.04 release,
downloads of Kubuntu CD 'ISO' images were higher than Ubuntu on some
mirrors.

It looks like KDE is happening, is here to stay.  Something important
for everyone wanting to run KDE in a business environment and for the
<nowiki>[[http://www.edubuntu.org/|Edubuntu]]</nowiki> team focusing on letting schools
run the ubuntu core in the best way for them.

If you prefer GNOME, remember that you have a choice and the freedom
to prefer---others have that freedom too.  Remember aswell that all
Linux is Good Linux, all *Ubuntu is good Ubuntu and all Freedom is
Good Freedom.
