== Feedback ==
* Add your comments here! -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:claydoh]]</nowiki>  * Wow, I've got it installed since alpha 2 in a system, and it's working great. There are only some minor issues, mainly with my radeon r200 still not very supported. Also, tested in an HP Pavilion DV5 from an USB media, it works great, responsive and looks very good. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:yoalieh]]</nowiki>
* The link from the main (news about release) page to this page seems to be wrong, please correct! -- -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:dgvirtual]]</nowiki>   * Corrected -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:yofel]]</nowiki>  * Would be good to add a note to "New Samba Filesharing" section of "Kubuntu 11.04 Released" page indicating that "kdenetwork-filesharing" needs to be installed, if not already, to see the sharing tab in Dolphin
