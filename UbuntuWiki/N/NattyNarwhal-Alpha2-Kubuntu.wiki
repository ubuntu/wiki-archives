Kubuntu will release version 11.04, the Natty Narwhal, in April 2011. With this, the second alpha pre-release, we are introducing some new and interesting things in preparation for our next official version. Read below for some of the highlights.

Pre-release versions of Kubuntu are NOT encouraged for anyone needing a stable system or for anyone who is not comfortable running into occasional, even frequent, breakage.

Our multimedia system has changed to GStreamer.  This offers consistency with the rest of Ubuntu, HTML5 video in our web browser and improved codec install facilities.

GTK applications such as Firefox or Inkscape now fit in with KDE's Plasma desktop.
