__TOC__

* <nowiki>[[NGO-ApplicationPackaging|NGO Packaging]]</nowiki> is moving on slowly, but surely: php-recaptcha, php-validate-it and php-services-json (all necessary for CiviCRM) now in our <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-ngo/+archive/ppa|our PPA]]</nowiki>; preliminaty packages of php-htmlpurifier and php-ids. Licensing issues of `php-validate-finance` have been resolved, this unblocks `php-validate-ie` and `php-validate-finance-creditcard`.
* Lots of new members: we're at 92 now.
