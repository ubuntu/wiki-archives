'''Topics Discussed'''

* Adding notifications for the EPC Mesh Network, we could create an account say on gmail and add it to the LoCo 
mailing list.

<gcleric> Adding notifications for the EPC Mesh Network, we could create an account say on gmail and add it to the LoCo<gcleric> mailing list. 

<tritium> Speaking of EPC, gcleric, we need a total cost from you, so we can reimburse you.

<deinerson1> I can forward the alerts with a gmail filter. I am doing that anyway. the dashboard sends to epcstaff@gmail.com

<gcleric> what are thoughts about forwarding the EPC mesh alerts to the LoCo mailing list?

<tritium> How often are notifications sent?  I don't want to spam the list unnecessarily.  There may be other ways to address notifications.

<gcleric> daily.<gcleric> once a day.

<deinerson1> gcleric: sounds good to me - what address? the listserv one?

<tritium> I think we could easily appoint someone to monitor the notifications, or automate the collection of notifications without sending daily posts to the list.

<gcleric> deinerson1: well that would be ubuntu-us-nm@lists.ubuntu.com  bit lets make sure everyone is OK with it.

<deinerson1> yeah, there's no digest - daily only

<gcleric> tritium: and if that someone is not available?

<dthomasdigital> How many notifications get created daily?

<tritium> gcleric: I would assume it is a priority to someone at EPC.

<gcleric> 1

<deinerson1> 1 notify daily, yes

<tritium> (If not to some in the LoCo)

<deinerson1> I get it daily

<dthomasdigital> If it's just 1 or 2 I don;t see a huge issue with the mailing list, the question then becomes who responds?

<genfool> I would help

<gcleric> ditto.

<genfool> if I could

<tritium> Again, if someone needs to respond, that is the same as having someone who could monitor notifications.

<dthomasdigital> The we should have a primary and a back up?

* Follow up on new LoCo Project with gclerc and genfool.

<tritium> Agreed.  Let's move on to item 2.

<gcleric> I've attempted to contact the person in charge but have not had any response.

<tritium> genfool: have you had any contact with him/her?

<gcleric> genfool: ya still with us?

<deinerson1> The troublesome one is OM2 in the St. Joseph's offices - access is annoying if too often. I have been waiting until evening to resetit, but have ordered line conditioners to hopefully prevent the current issue 

<genfool> what does the job "monitor notifacations" entail

<deinerson1> so far it entails power cycling the routers

<tritium> Are we capable of doing that remotely?

<genfool> physically being their

<gcleric> tritium: power cycling?

<tritium> yes.

<gcleric> no.

<deinerson1> unplugging it, then plugging it back in is what I have been doing

<nick125> Ouch, that sucks. Can't you SSH in and type "reboot"? :)

<tritium> So, in order to act on notifications, we need to have a man on the grounds.

<gcleric> deinerson1: I think we need to swap OM2 with another router to see if it is hardware.

<deinerson1> nick125: I think we can ssh in, but haven't explored it

<gcleric> my thoughts are if this is an LoCo project these should go to the LoCo...not just one person.

<tritium> And, if that's the case, I'd propose that deinerson1 consider being the monitor point for notifications.  He can notify us if there are issues we need to act on.

<deinerson1> I am happy to do that

<gcleric> -1

<dthomasdigital> Thats logical and the backup?

<tritium> Similarly, I don't sent #ubuntu IRC channel maintenance emails to the list, or launchpad team issues to the list.

<dthomasdigital> but the EPC stuff is uniquely us

<deinerson1> There are two other staff and reseidents that could get into St. Josephs if need be 

<gcleric> tritium: but those are not projects that we have started as a loco.

<deinerson1> residents that are also staff

<tritium> gcleric: sure they are.  They were the first ones.

<gcleric> tritium: really? how are  #ubuntu IRC channel maintenance emails  loco projects?

<dthomasdigital> tritium I guess technically you are correct but we do not run IRC or launchpad,

<tritium> gcleric: they are LoCo team resources, and require regular maintenance

<gcleric> tritium: but they are not projects that we've started with the intention of supporting.

<tritium> As does the mailing list, which we recently modified.

<protonchris> I propose that the maintenance emails go to the contacts at EPC.  If they need help, they could email the list.

<dthomasdigital> Well should we get a list pf LoCo projects and get primary and backup administrators listed as well?

<dthomasdigital> protonchris I can support that idea

<tritium> That would be consistent with what we have now -- primary and backup contacts for various things such as IRC channel, mailing list, calendar, etc.

<tritium> I second protonchris' proposal.

<dthomasdigital> tritium should I compose a list (we kind of have one) and list it on the wiki?

<tritium> dthomasdigital: let's revisit that list in the near term

<tritium> Shall we first close this item?

<dthomasdigital> cool

<dthomasdigital> we should vote on it first

<dthomasdigital> +1

<protonchris> deinerson1 or gcleric: can a custom message be added to the maintenance emails? 

<tritium> dthomasdigital: which proposal is that for?  The agenda item 1 proposal, or protonchris' proposal?

<dthomasdigital> protonchris proposal we should see how it works as always we should remain flexible, if we need to change things around we can.

<tritium> protonchris: what is your idea regarding custom messages?

<deinerson1> prontochris: not easily on the custom alert. It appears we can setup a custom.sh script to run, though not experienced with this

<protonchris> The custom message could just have the loco mailing list info if the person who receives the email cannot resolve the problem.

<tritium> That's a good idea.

<dthomasdigital> great idea

<tritium> My vote: +1 for notifications to contacts (-1 for notifications to mailing list)

<deinerson1> it's easy to send the alerts tomultiple emails right from the dashboard

<dthomasdigital> My vote: +1 for notifications to contacts (-1 for notifications to mailing list) (+1 to modify the notifications to include loco contact info)

<protonchris> I suggest that the notifications go to deinerson1 and anyone he deems appropriate.

<tritium> deinerson1: are you cool with that?

<deinerson1> yes, totally

<tritium> We're missing jimrz for his vote, and gcleric has not voted.

<gcleric> +0

<deinerson1> Here's a screenshot of the dashboard notifications setup: http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/369550/open-mesh_notifications1.jpg

<tritium> 3 for, and 0 opposed.  Looks like it's settled.

<deinerson1> only 1 email a day even if more than one router is down

<tritium> As far as I can tell.

<protonchris> gcleric: I agree that epc is our project, but I thought our ultimate goal was for them to be self sufficient.

<tritium> That echoes my sentiment as well.

<protonchris> anyway, let's move on

<protonchris> Lets stay open to changing this if we need to.

<dthomasdigital> I so agree

* Our LoCo did not take part in the global bug jam, what can we do to make the next one?

<dthomasdigital> item 3?

<tritium> Yes.

<dthomasdigital> I so have no idea how to work on bugs....and so want to.

<protonchris> We'll if other locos participate in their irc channel, a good first step might be to attend theirs.

<tritium> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RunningBugJam

<tritium> We should try to schedule a few of us to attend the "How to run a Bug Jam" IRC session in #ubuntu-meeting, when they have another one.

<tritium> And try to be ready for the next go-around.

<tritium> We'd want to put some effort into preparation for it, so we can do a decent job.

<dthomasdigital> I'll make sure I keep up to date on the dates
