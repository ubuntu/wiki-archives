==== Agenda ====
 
* The New Mexico Ubuntu LoCo now has accounts on Twitter and identi.ca account names on the Ubuntu wiki <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MicroBlogging|microblogging list]]</nowiki>. Want to be a micoblogger for the group? Contact David Thomas dthomas@ubuntu.com for account details.
* Adding notifications for the EPC Mesh Network, we could create an account say on gmail and add it to the LoCo mailing list.
* Mark your calendar for the kick-off <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LoCoTeamMeeting|Ubuntu LoCo Team Meeting]]</nowiki> on Sat 28th Feb 6pm, 1800 UTC.
* Proposal by the two currently listed LoCo "contacts" (Mike and Dave) for the formation of the NM LoCo council, to assume the role of decision-making and leadership for the LoCo, as a team.  Nominations for the council:
** tritium
** dthomasdigital
** protonchris
** gcleric
** jimrz
* If the above council is formed, the <nowiki>[[http://seehuhn.de/pages/vote|Debian Voting System]]</nowiki> may be considered
* mneptok has generously offered to provide webhosting for the LoCo at <nowiki>[[http://hosting.birdhouse.org|birdhouse]]</nowiki>
** Pros: No more waiting for Canonical sysadmins to process hosting request, likely quicker response time, release of customized Drupal as LoCo hosting platform makes setup far easier ( http://www.fabianrodriguez.com/blog/2009/02/13/drupal-5x-and-6x-loco-suite-released/ ), cPanel access allows greater self-sufficiency
** Cons: Not part of Canonical's hosting infrastructure
* Just a note about more ubuntu and Drupal https://launchpad.net/loco-drupal
* tritium would like to nominate Doomcat the official Scratch and game developer of the NM LoCo
* vote on changing the default ubuntu-us-nm mailing list behavior so that the default reply-to is the list not a posters email address.
** Argument against: <nowiki>[[http://www.unicom.com/pw/reply-to-harmful.html]]</nowiki>
** Argument for: <nowiki>[[http://www.metasystema.net/essays/reply-to.mhtml]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/GlobalBugJam|Global Bug Jam]]</nowiki> This weekend
