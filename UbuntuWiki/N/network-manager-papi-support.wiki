=== Summary ===
Include PAP auth method on network-manager

=== Rationale ===
I use wpa_supplicant for access to wireless networks. I prefer it because it don't need a Xserver running. I know users on my University and on others universities of Spain that want use network-manager to connect its networks but network-manager no support this. There aren't the possibility to set PAP auth method on network-manager-applet or I don't discover it.

=== Use Cases ===

=== Scope ===
PAP auth is used by the authenticate system of Universities to identify its members, like alumnus, teachers and other members of university community.
