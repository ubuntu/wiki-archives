This package contains translatable strings, which can not be translated with language packs, therefore it is affected by the https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NonLanguagePackTranslationDeadline. In order to deliver translations for these strings, the existing translations should be exported from LP and included in the source, then a new package has to be build.
