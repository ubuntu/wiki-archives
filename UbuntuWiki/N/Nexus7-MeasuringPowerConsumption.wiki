=== Nexus7 Power Measurement ===

Steve Conklin did an initial investigation on the power consumption on the Nexus7 by watching the I2C bus and doing some disassembly of the unit:

* <nowiki>[[attachment:nexus-power.odp|Initial Nexus7 Power Investigation (ODP)]]</nowiki>
* git repo for tools mentioned in the above presentation:  `git@github.com:sconklin/nexus-tools.git` (https://github.com/sconklin/nexus-tools)

=== Identifying Issues ===

The same tools used to identify power issues for other architectures (like powertop) work just fine:
* <nowiki>[[Kernel-PowerManagement-IdentifyingIssues| Identifying Power Management Issues]]</nowiki>

* Measuring CPU usage is a good way to detect when your application is drawing too much power, kcachegrind and callgrind (part of Valgrind) are excellent tools.

=== Statistics ===

Colin King maintains several tools to gather statistics on power consumption:

* <nowiki>[[http://smackerelofopinion.blogspot.com.es/2011/12/monitoring-proctimerstats.html|Eventstat]]</nowiki>: calculates the rate of events per second and can dump the data in a .csv 

* $ sudo apt-get install eventstat
* $ sudo eventstat

=== Hardware Tools ===
The ARM Energy Probe is a hardware tool that is fairly cheap and can be used to measure power consumption.  It uses a GPL software stack and offers command-line and HTML5+websockets interface.  Here is an intro video on using the <nowiki>[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDStdtopy_g|ARM Energy Probe]]</nowiki>.

At Linaro Connect, Andy Green, from Linaro, gave a very good presentation on power measurement (<nowiki>[[attachment:slides.pdf|Slides on PDF]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTwqaKFiSNk|Youtube presentation]]</nowiki>)
