Dear Mark, dear Ubuntu developers,

====  ====

We the undersigned petition you to reconsider your decision of including binary drivers by default in the next Ubuntu release. We believe, as you do, that it should be as easy as possible for end users to enable extra functionality via closed software when necessary and if they so wish, but only after an explicit acknowledgement and only after being informed about the issues at stake and possible alternatives. Users can be given the option to install closed drivers/software during installation or soon after installation or when an application that may require such software is run for the first time. It is a small change, but one that will avoid dividing the community on an issue that many hold dear, without sacrificing ease of use and product appeal. We therefore encourage you to opt for easy-installation as opposed to pre-installation.

# João Crespo - Why not let the problem of blobs installation up to the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommonCustomizations|common customizations]]</nowiki> spec (a GUI somewhere at system » administration or something similar)? is the solution found to all the other non-free stuff instead of bundling with for default or asking the user during the install if he wants flash, codecs, etc....

# David Nielsen - First it was wifi, then it was graphics. What freedom and supportability is going to fall at the hand of temporary highly limited functionality next? Instead of doing this we should fund and support work towards bridging the functionality gap with free drivers.
# Lloyd Almeida
# Guy Johnston - I only use GNU/Linux and other free software for the freedom it allows me. My next installation is likely to be gNewSense. If this increase in installing proprietary software by default continues, it definitely will be, and I won't use Ubuntu or any of its official variants again.

# Simon Bürger
# Bernhard Hanakam - via http://www.ubuntuusers.de/ikhaya/354/ - Please give the user the opportunity to choose, because this is what linux is. A GUI is IMHO a good solution, but the closed drivers should stay in restricted, not in the default installation. Mark and all the others: don't let ubuntu become some stuff like SuSE. Keep thinking of bug #1!
# Ueli Zahnd

# Richard Hirner - via http://www.ubuntuusers.de/ikhaya/354/ - I have installed and recommended Ubuntu Linux to many people, but I won't support another "Lindows"
# Oliver Gellner
# Martin Gräßlin - Why don't you try to persuade the companies to change their closed source drivers to open source? That would be the best for the users.
# David Fu - maybe gNewSense does make sense after all.
# Carsten Schmidt
# AndreasGnau - The user has to be informed about both the advantages and disadvantages.
# Marco Hunseler - Please, dont do that :-\
# Gaurav Mishra - this will forget the real ubuntu spirit and will be followed by the commercial market requirements ,

# IanDarwin - Every single time you install a binary blob driver, you convince some big company that "open source" just doesn't matter. Is that what you want to do?
# Christian Wagner - via http://www.ubuntuusers.de/ikhaya/354/
# <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DavidTangye|David Tangye]]</nowiki> - In addition I also support (see http://boycottnovell.com/category/ubuntu/ "12.23.06 Ubuntu No Blobs By Default Petition"): "put a button that sends an email to the detected hardware vendor complaining about this extra step. Then, vendors will see just how many customers it does affect and act; by Ubuntu doing it for the end user without interaction, there will be no market backlash or incentive to open up."

# Bartosz Bogacz - please don't forget that many of us are using linux because its open-source and not because its better or free

# Peter Levi - Ubuntu won me over XP by being free and open. It does not work better for me, quite the contrary. 3D acceleration won't change a thing in this aspect - I hardly find it necessary for the average user, and it is useless for me. But binary drivers would mean Ubuntu's greatest and most important advantage will diminish.
# Niko Manos
# Celso Araujo - Free by default, non-free by choice!
# KarlGoetz
# Jonathan Kotta: I use the nonfree drivers, but it should definately be choice.  
# Daniel Miles: I also use the non-free Drivers, but when a linux system is free at its most basic levels, a user should easily be able to retain that freedom, or at least understand when they choose not to.
# Mikko Viinamäki - Freedom by default!
