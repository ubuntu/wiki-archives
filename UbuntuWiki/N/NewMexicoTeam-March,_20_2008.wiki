==== Agenda ====
 1. Flyers and general marketing for 8.04 release party:
    a. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MarketingTeam/Materials
    a. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LoCoActivism
# Document freedom day is March 26th.  Any ideas?
# Software freedom day 2008 is September 20th.  We need to start thinking of a location.
# We've received a generous offer from EPC for office space.  Could we make good use of this space, and give back to EPC?  One possible way to give back would be to participate in grant writing, focused on computing, to "earn our keep."

If you want to add anything else to the agenda, please feel free!
