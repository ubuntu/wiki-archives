==== Support ====
I've been using Ubuntu since Hoary went stable, and I've spent a lot of time helping out new users on the #ubuntu IRC channel.  I believe the best support software can get is people actively talking about it.  So if you want to talk to me, my alias is Tiglionabbit, and you can find me on Gmail/Gtalk, AIM, and Freenode IRC.

==== Games ====
* <nowiki>[[http://wiki.kraterbikes.dforge.cse.ucsc.edu/|KraterBikes]]</nowiki>
Me and some guys from my Software Methodology class made this game.  Despite the name, there are no craters or bikes in this game.  It's an internet multiplayer thing where you fly around with jetpacks and shoot lasers at eachother.  It works great on Ubuntu.  Try it out, if you want!  (requires SDL, SDL_image, and SDL_net).
