<nowiki>[[http://www.cis.rit.edu/user/11|Dr. Peter Anderson]]</nowiki>, Professor Emeritus RIT, will give a presentation on J.<<BR>><<BR>>

J is Ken Iverson's APL in disguise.  Unlike APL,
programs are written in ASCII; like APL it is a superb
"array processing language" -- Iverson called it an
executable mathematical notation.

J is a functional language: functions are first
class object, easy to define and manipulate.  It is
interactive, like Python, Perl, etc.

J reminds me a lot of the Unix shells with lots
of well thought out elementary components
and the glue to stick them together (i.e.,
pipes, redirection, etc.).  J supplies the
primitives for dealing with arrays (lists, table,
report) and the glue, several types of function
composition, to make  a superbly useful system.

See http://jsoftware.com/ for a copy of the software
as well as lots of free books and articles.
