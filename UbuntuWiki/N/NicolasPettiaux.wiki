__TOC__

I have used free software since 1993 and I have been an active advocate, promoter, conference organizer and speaker since 1998.

A former ICT manager of public adminsitration, my main activity is now to teach physics and computer sciences at secondary level and help write free content physics documents. My complimentary activity is to coordinate the implementation of free softwares in associations, SME, primary and secondary schools.
