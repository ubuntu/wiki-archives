<kenneth> I'm in walking distance of Cottonwood mall
<gcleric> genfool:  I'm down with that.
<dthomasdigital> genfool, hard enough getting people to show up at one
<jimrz> me too
<dthomasdigital> but I'm open
<ColonelPanik> There are numerous game/computer/coffee places in Albuq/RR  Maybe a display in each of them.  Even if its just a poster and some CDs?
<jimrz> we have enough active folks now to handle
<genfool> If for some reason one falls through the cracks???
<gcleric> ColonelPanik: that's a good Idea!  A mini display with CD's.

<gcleric> genfool: is there prior contact required or is it a dry call?
<dthomasdigital> genfool good idea as the date gets closer we need to remember that
