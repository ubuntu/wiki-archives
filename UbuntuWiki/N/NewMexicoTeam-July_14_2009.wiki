<dthomasdigital> He was very nice about it last time I talked to him
<protonchris> Wow.  I didn't think it would require this much effort to get a table at the mall.
<dthomasdigital> he had requested that I call him back mid-July to see if we could book it
<gcleric> dthomasdigital: he's the one who downloaded ubuntu...after you mentioned it...
<dthomasdigital> They are really weird about who gets to do it
