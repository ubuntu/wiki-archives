__TOC__

My name is Nour Haridy, i'm a 14 years old, twitter based activist, telecomix activist at night =_=.
I'm also a Ubuntu Linux Administrator and student.
Python student, since i'm still going though learning coding, this is my first language.
I love politics and computing.

I met telecomix activists on their IRC during the last critical events, and i wanted to give them any information they would need to help us get over this, and also to help us against SCAF bureaucracy.
So, we decided to make a whole Egyptian Telecomix cell, since there is already a tunisian one and a syrian one.
