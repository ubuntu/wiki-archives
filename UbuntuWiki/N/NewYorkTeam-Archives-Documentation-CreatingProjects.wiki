2. Put the idea into words. Think about the best way to phrase the idea you have. If you can think about ways that we could implement ti.

3. Post your idea to the <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=387941|Project Ideas and Discussion thread]]</nowiki>.

4. Discuss your idea. talk about your idea with other people. The team as a whole (that means yourself included) will decide what the importance of the project is and whether or not its worth implementing.
