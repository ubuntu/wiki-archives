Devices I use to test NetworkManager functionality. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:mathieu-tl]]</nowiki> 
=== Wired ===

* tg3
* r8169 (in two different systems)

=== WiFi ===

* Laptop with an ath9k device.
* Laptop with an iwlwifi device.
* ZyDAS ZD1211B 802.11g USB dongle (using the zd1211rw driver)

=== 3G ===

Working:

* ZTE MF112
* ZTE MF636
* Option GI0461
* Sierra Aircard 330U
* Sierra USB 306
* Sierra Compass 889
* Nokia CS-18
* Huawei E1831

And other devices that appear broken due to reasons other than NM being buggy:
 
* Huawei E220 and E226 -- they don't seem to accept my SIM cards; properly detected by ModemManager and "accessible" via DBUS with no SIM.
* Option iCON 225 -- could be a firmware issue. Once detected the LED flashes like crazy; MM detection never completes.
