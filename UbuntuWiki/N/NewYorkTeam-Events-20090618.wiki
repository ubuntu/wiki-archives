=== Recap ===

Despite worries that attendance would be low 24 people attended Justin Kirby's presentation on Erlang. The presentation dealt with both a high level over view of the language and some specific examples of what make the language unique. Five new people were at this meeting and one of them volunteered to do a presentation on Lua.
