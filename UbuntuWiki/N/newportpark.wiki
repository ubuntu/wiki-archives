Hello! I am using Lubuntu 12.10 on my ibook G4 and Xubuntu 12.04 on my Gateway desktop. Both are working great. The ibook was made in 2004. I swiched to Lubuntu after Apple dropped support for Power PC Macs. I also wanted to switch because the last two updates to OSX made the ibook noticeably slower.  

My Gateway was made in 2002 and originally had Windows xp as its os. I switched to Ubuntu 10.04 after Microsoft stopped supporting xp several years ago. I recently switched to Xubuntu because I didn't like Unity.
