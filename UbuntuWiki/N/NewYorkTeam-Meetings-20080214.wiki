[19:03:13] <ausimage> hal14450: want to give a report on the rochester meetup?
[19:03:55] <hal14450_> we had fun but i was a bit preoccupied w/ my borkage of my laptop
[19:04:10] <hal14450_> for that matter so was everyone else 
[19:04:43] <ausimage> wish I could have made that one :/
[19:05:06] <hal14450_> we came up w/ a plan for me to resolve the situation and i followed that plan then jaguar gave me the commend i needed to mount the encrypted partition
[19:05:17] <hal14450_> command*
[19:05:34] <hal14450_> which was no fun since i didn't even get to look it up
[19:05:45] <ausimage> so it IS helpful to attend and hold local meetups ;)
[19:06:09] <hal14450_> absolutely
[19:06:15] <ausimage> next....
[19:06:15] <spudnoggin> somebody said next was the Report from NYC Meetup?
[19:06:55] <ausimage> I have heard that Cybermatt is working on a meetup for Syrcuse area... no details yet...
[19:07:22] <hal14450_> well i'll try and make a meetup out there is scheduling permits
[19:07:23] <ausimage> Community Advocacy and support....
[19:07:41] <ausimage> yeah I was thinking the same too....
[19:08:06] <hal14450_> carpool is an option then
[19:08:13] <ausimage> yeah
[19:08:49] <ausimage> in S&A we have rochester refurbish and recycle... hal14450 any more details?
[19:09:40] <hal14450_> i'm still working on a presentation and my contact for ABC is on vacation so i'll have to wait and see but any ideas or help for a presentation is welcome
[19:09:51] <hal14450_> not quite there yet 
[19:10:09] <ausimage> hal14450: give me a look see and I will see what I can do to help
[19:10:45] <hal14450_> i did some screencasts and screenshots and wrote up a brief explanation of open source apps and ubuntu/linux
[19:11:05] <hal14450_> let me polish it up a bit first ;-)
[19:11:23] <ausimage> awesome... sure... email me when you have something to look at
[19:11:33] <hal14450_> cool
[19:11:52] <ausimage> Ok... I am suggesting to look at making up some yard signs and bumper stickers....
[19:12:08] <ausimage> to promote awareness of Ubuntu in our communities
[19:12:43] <ausimage> I think we can even push out the results to other LoCos when we have something....
[19:13:08] <ausimage> that might give us a better price point for producing them
[19:13:32] <ausimage> I think we should probably keep them simple...
[19:13:59] <ausimage> Ubuntu... [catchy slogan] Ubuntu.com
[19:14:05] <ausimage> kind of thing...
[19:14:24] <hal14450_> maybe an "ask me about ubuntu" sticker or buttons would work well with that
[19:14:35] <ausimage> maybe we should put out a call for suggested slogans
[19:14:49] <hal14450_> posting fliers at a library is a good idea as well
[19:14:50] <ausimage> yeah that too... would be nice
[19:15:27] <ausimage> My thoughts are to come up with about three slogans... and use them everywhere...
[19:15:56] <ausimage> with a very basic design that translates well to the various formats...
[19:16:03] * hal14450_ is sort of partial to "ask me about ubuntu"
[19:16:23] <hal14450_> i'd put a sticker on my laptop that says that ;-)
[19:16:37] <ausimage> I like.... Ubuntu... the other [OS|Computer|Windows]
[19:16:54] <ausimage> or Ubuntu... Freedom of Choice
[19:17:15] <ausimage> * perhaps a variation of that one :S
[19:17:27] <hal14450_> powered by ubuntu or ubuntu capable
[19:17:34] <ausimage> :)
[19:17:54] <ausimage> I think I will put an email out about this... to get more feedback...
[19:18:11] <hal14450_> i'd like to ask Gnu_Joe if he still wants to do that podcast thing
[19:18:19] <hal14450_> maybe i should email him
[19:18:30] <ausimage> ah yeah... that would be awesome to get going....
[19:18:59] <ausimage> lastly... I would like someone to go through the  Team Application for official recognition
[19:19:05] <ausimage> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NewYorkTeam/Approval
[19:19:25] <ausimage> and help us get it fleshed and linked out
[19:19:43] <ausimage> I would like to get the team approved soon....
[19:20:02] <hal14450_> yeh would be a big step forward
[19:20:05] <ausimage> Anything else from the team?
[19:20:56] <ausimage> cool... then lets adjourn this meeting</pre>
