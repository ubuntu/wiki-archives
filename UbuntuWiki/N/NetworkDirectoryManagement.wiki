=== Summary ===

=== Release Note ===

=== Rationale ===

=== User stories ===

* create/edit/update/delete a user/group/host/service via web and CLI.
* search for user/group/host/service via web and CLI.
* change user password.

=== Assumptions ===

=== Design ===

Several options:

==== Freeipa v2 ====

Pros:
* Actively developed.
* Solves our use cases.
* Infrastructure already available:
** install scripts
** management interface in python, both CLI and web.

Cons:
* Upstream only interested in supporting Fedora Directory Server: https://www.redhat.com/archives/freeipa-users/2009-May/msg00020.html

* v2 targeted for Q3 2009: https://www.redhat.com/archives/freeipa-users/2009-June/msg00008.html

* Technical choice (minor): xmlrpc.

==== Freeipa v1 ====
Pros: 
* already released.
* support base use case.
* web + cli support.

Cons:
* v2 is a rewrite.
* unknown support from upstream for v1.

==== smbldap-tools ====
Pros:
* already packaged.
* minor updates to support default DIT.

Cons:
* Only covers User/Group mgmt.
* upstream not very active.
* cmd line only.

==== ldapscripts ====
Pros:
* already packaged.
* minor updates to support default DIT.

Cons:
* Only covers User/Group mgmt.
* Cmd line only

==== Gosa ====
* web interface written in php.
* no CLI.
* ACL stored as an attribute in the object rather than using the native openldap ACL system.

==== New mgmt interface ====

(pylons|turbogears)+lazr.restful+lazr.restclient.

Something similar to the new Mailman 3 admin interface:

=== Implementation ===

==== FreeIPA v1 ====

1. Update to support different DIT and package relevant part of freeipa v1 components: 
*** ipa-server/xmlrpc-server
*** ipa-admintools
*** ipa-server/ipa-gui

Note: ipa-kpasswd is not needed as it's supported in kadmind starting from 1.7.

=== BoF agenda and discussion ===

===== UDS Karmic discussion =====

<pre>
== Managing the Directory ==

* Tool target Audience.
** Tools for system admins, or users.
** Allow customization by admins.

* phpldapadmin

* Need task specific tools.
** Won't be provided by Ubuntu because they are too specific to the domain.
** Should Ubuntu make the task easier?

* Provide tools to manage the default DIT.
** MDS tools.
** Goza 
** Cluttered interface.
** Not all features may be useful.
** smbldaptools
** Works well.
** Needs some configuration.
** Need to learn new commands.
* Apache Directory Studio
** Tool for System Admin.

* adduser added functionality.
** Will adduser only affect local user's, or the whole directory.
** To manipulate the directory a special switch would be needed.
** Still have an issue with password sync.

* Focus on one task at a time.

* Provide New tools for the Directory.
** Web Admin component.
** Web2LDAP -- customized
 
* Need a write interface to the NSS attributes.
** getent
** putent
** delent 
** Need to specify which backend to manipulate.

* For Karmic
** adduser
** addgroup
** modifygroup
** addhost?
** sudoers
</pre>
