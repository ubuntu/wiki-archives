(07:06:06 PM) ausimage: hal14450: whats the addie to send to?
(07:06:31 PM) hal14450: well you can send to hardyheron@nerdsonlinux.com
(07:06:44 PM) hal14450: i guess that's final now lol
(07:06:52 PM) ausimage: We also are hoping to see members from Syracuse and Buffalo areas...
(07:07:05 PM) ausimage: perhaps even down to Ithaca :/
(07:07:13 PM) hal14450: you might receive a message saying it's awaiting moderation
(07:07:44 PM) ausimage: Those Interested in finding out more about what is up in NYC....
(07:08:33 PM) ausimage: You are encouraged to ping MJording or check out  http://linux.meetup.com/392...
(07:08:50 PM) ausimage: He assured me that he had things covered in NYC
(07:09:19 PM) ausimage: That brings me to the next subject
(07:09:30 PM) ausimage: Leadership er Coordination...
(07:09:54 PM) hal14450: local coordination
(07:09:56 PM) hal14450: ?
(07:09:57 PM) ausimage: We can use members to help with the coordination of activities in their local area
(07:09:59 PM) ausimage: yeah
(07:10:18 PM) hal14450: leadership sounds too fussy
(07:10:37 PM) hal14450: it implies responsibility lol
(07:10:46 PM) ausimage: I am relying on the members to formulate their strategies for meetups and activities in their area....
(07:11:07 PM) ausimage: I do not know enough about every part of the state ....
(07:11:28 PM) ausimage: I am however willing to support the activities with promotion and advice....
(07:11:47 PM) ausimage: that probably goes for other members here as well ;)
(07:12:04 PM) ausimage: Membership:
(07:12:15 PM) hal14450: everyone that's interested should feel empowered to start doing stuff to help right?
(07:12:26 PM) ausimage: Yeah exactly !!!
(07:13:09 PM) ausimage: On membership.... it seems to have stagnated and a few have not reupped their membership on Launchpad...
(07:13:37 PM) ausimage: I am open to suggestions as to improving this :)
(07:14:02 PM) ausimage: Just PING me or drop an email...
(07:14:07 PM) hal14450: i'm guilty of not being a launchpad regular myself but i'm still keen on spreading the ubuntu love and foss love in general
(07:14:57 PM) ausimage: hal14450: I am not sure why... it is fairly simple to just clink the link in the email that comes asking to renew...
(07:15:32 PM) ausimage: so I think some have decided it was not what they thought or time has dissapeared for them...
(07:15:47 PM) deejoe: of what possible benefit is it even to do that?  The instinct in this day and age is to actively avoid anything like that at all, most specifically as an anti-spam measure, but more generally as a way of conserving time and attention.
(07:16:09 PM) deejoe: "even to do that" == renew, or sign up in the first place
(07:16:19 PM) deejoe: (bedtime now)
(07:16:55 PM) ausimage: deejoe: the Ubuntu Community for whatever reason has decided to track membership with Launchpad....
(07:17:21 PM) hal14450: i can't keep track of all the mailing lists i'm on in a timely manner
(07:17:25 PM) ausimage: and I am aware of those that just click and forget... or even decide later it was not for them....
(07:18:02 PM) ausimage: so the renew option helps ensure the active members remain on the Membership List
(07:18:04 PM) ausimage: :)
(07:19:13 PM) ausimage: Launchpad is not a list perse... just a place to track membership for the most part....
(07:19:31 PM) ausimage: ummm... next topic
(07:19:32 PM) spudnoggin: next topic is Team Official recognition...
(07:19:47 PM) ausimage: spudnoggin: forget next topic
(07:19:47 PM) spudnoggin: ausimage: I forgot next topic
(07:20:11 PM) ausimage: its Actually Community Advocacy and Support
(07:20:28 PM) ausimage: hal14450: how goes the computer refurbishing?
(07:21:03 PM) hal14450: ausimage, we might want to steer away from the bureaucratic side of things and focus on community related activities at least for the time being
(07:21:15 PM) hal14450: it's going well actually
(07:21:36 PM) ausimage: thats great hal14450!
(07:21:49 PM) ausimage: do we have a taker for the first batch?
(07:21:52 PM) hal14450: i've got a another bunch of computers to drop off at a local church

(07:22:50 PM) ausimage: good to hear finally
(07:23:01 PM) hal14450: might have to load christian edition ubuntu on them to make it a more satisfying experience but overall we're doing well
(07:23:13 PM) ausimage: ok
(07:23:29 PM) hal14450: could use donation of a server for an ltsp type of setup though
(07:24:00 PM) hal14450: something powerful enough to make them more efficient
(07:24:26 PM) ausimage: uh huh
(07:25:08 PM) ausimage: K.. Last main Topic?
(07:25:14 PM) hal14450: we also did a cd handout at the Rochester Public Market

(07:25:53 PM) ausimage: awesome
(07:26:12 PM) ausimage: you demo the OS too?
(07:26:25 PM) hal14450: i'll probably wind up paying for new discs to hand out but it's a good investment
(07:26:39 PM) hal14450: yes we has a few machines setup
(07:26:41 PM) ausimage: hal14450: we can get some from ship it too
(07:26:51 PM) hal14450: yeh but that takes a while
(07:27:11 PM) ausimage: though not as many than when we are official :/
(07:27:14 PM) hal14450: we still have some free ones to hand out though
(07:27:52 PM) hal14450: the discs were supplied by on-disk.com
(07:27:59 PM) ausimage: cool... hal14450 did you want some help with the weekly handouts?
(07:27:59 PM) hal14450: free ones ;-)
(07:28:18 PM) hal14450: any help will be appreciated
(07:28:23 PM) ***ausimage probably would not be available but others maybe too
(07:28:33 PM) ausimage: cool... 
(07:28:43 PM) hal14450: my friend nate showed up
(07:28:56 PM) hal14450: and next weekend Dave123 might be there
(07:28:57 PM) ***ausimage puts blog on Hal14450 weekly handouts at the Public Market;)
(07:29:23 PM) hal14450: it's practice anyway
(07:29:40 PM) ausimage: did you get the FOSS material you needed?
(07:30:14 PM) hal14450: more people were interested in buying my laptop than anything else and that was the in we used to explain that we were showcasing linux
(07:30:26 PM) ausimage: :)
(07:30:55 PM) hal14450: ausimage, i need to edit a handout and print off a few hundred copies
(07:30:56 PM) ausimage: hal14450: I found an email from US-Mentors... that has tons of info for FOSS 
(07:31:30 PM) hal14450: well i'll be there next weekend for anyone that wants to hand out discs
(07:31:38 PM) ausimage: hal14450: too bad we can't get them through on the cheap...
(07:31:52 PM) hal14450: we can get them on the cheap
(07:31:55 PM) ausimage: the copies I mean...
(07:32:16 PM) ausimage: thats good... copying can get costly
(07:32:20 PM) hal14450: oh well i'll just print them out myself
(07:32:33 PM) hal14450: or find someone to do them cheap
(07:32:52 PM) ausimage: hal14450: I was thinking of getting an employer to get some or all of them copied ;)
(07:32:58 PM) hal14450: we had a good time hanidng out discs and people were responsive
(07:33:05 PM) ausimage: that is good...
(07:34:08 PM) ausimage: I think as a last topic I am going to roll it all into a call for an active members sip conference call...
(07:34:45 PM) ausimage: to discuss Developing and Encouraging Membership Activities...
(07:35:18 PM) ausimage: probably would not happen till mid-May now :/
(07:35:26 PM) ***hal14450 watches the server crumble under the load
(07:36:04 PM) ausimage: I think getting those who WANT to get active and involved is the best place to solve the last topics on the agenda
(07:36:04 PM) hal14450: well we can use it just to get to know eachother better
(07:36:20 PM) ausimage: or make a little headway
(07:36:28 PM) ausimage: yeah that would be good too...
(07:36:49 PM) hal14450: we're NY and we're proud of it
(07:37:40 PM) ausimage: Ok I will send out an email at some point asking for good days and times in Mid-may
(07:38:04 PM) ausimage: I am hoping for maximum participation! :)
(07:38:35 PM) ausimage: .... and rid the feeling that I am the only one attempting to drag this boulder up the hill ;)
(07:39:07 PM) hal14450: quiet sysyphus!
(07:39:12 PM) hal14450: lol
