== Ubuntu New York State LoCo Team Newsletter ==
The New York State Ubuntu Local Community (LoCo) Team is a group of volunteers united by a commitment to Ubuntu and free and open source software (FOSS). The team advocates and supports Ubuntu for home, business, and educational use in New York State. By bringing the freedom of choice, power of the community, and stability of Ubuntu to the public, the team believes it can change the face of computing for the better.

The primary purpose of the team newsletter is to document everything the team has done.  The reader should get a sense of the activities conducted by the team both offline and online. Experienced members should find information on "what happened" and "what's going on," while newer members should find information on how to get involved. In addition to this primary purpose, the team newsletter can add another community aspect to the team and contain articles written by members on relevant topics.

Welcome to the New York State LoCo Team Newsletter, Issue #2 for February 2009.
