<tritium> Item 1: JauntyJackalope is coming, scheduled for release in April 23, 2009.  Let's see if we can come up with a tentative date for our Release Party. Also, any ideas / suggestions / preferences regarding possible locations for the party welcomed.
* deinerson1 (n=chatzill@c-68-35-135-32.hsd1.nm.comcast.net) has joined #ubuntu-us-nm
<Doomcat> Hello deinerson1
<dthomasdigital> Not sure what Jim's been up to
<deinerson1> Doomcat: hey there and hello all
<tritium> Hi, deinerson1.
<tritium> So, 4/23 is a Thursday.  Discuss amongst yourselves...
<dthomasdigital> I say the weekend gives me time to make some disc
<protonchris> Unfortunately, the end of April is pretty busy for me.
<tritium> Me too, actually.  Especially if baby comes early.
<dthomasdigital> Oh no protonchris you can't get out of this one
<gen_fool> Sounds so cool as I have never been to a install party    How many would we expect and what type of atmosphere?
<dthomasdigital> now tritium has an excuse 
<dthomasdigital> It's a party
<tritium> gen_fool: we've typically had under 20, I think.
<dthomasdigital> Once we had a computer class show had about 40 people that night
<tritium> Well, shall we table it?  Not much discussion on it.
<protonchris> +1
<gen_fool> local arts theater and coffee shop on central close to epc, I donated some hours on construction, does that sound like something we would want?
<dthomasdigital> +1
<tritium> gen_fool: sounds interesting!
<tritium> Item 2: The New Mexico Linux Forums: What can we do to increase volume?
<dthomasdigital> They seem a little slow, I'l start posting our events at least
<SonicSounds> Question: I'm new to the forums ... are these regular discussion board forums or something else ... pardon my ignorance :)
<tritium> dthomasdigital: we may need to take another look at the forums.  I believe things have changed since we were approved, and we may have more administrative rights than we currently enjoy.
<dthomasdigital> support, discussions, event posting all centralized around Ubuntu.
<SonicSounds> Thanks!
<dthomasdigital> tritium, really your right that would be great.
<tritium> I'm not a big forum user, though.  Eric is/(was?) our forums administrator.
<tritium> Not sure who should follow up on that.
<dthomasdigital> Well, that's a good question.
* deinerson1 has quit (Remote closed the connection)
<SonicSounds> Just curious ... what kinds of folks or categories of users are we trying to encourage to use the forums?
<tritium> SonicSounds: anybody at all, really.
<SonicSounds> Ok
<tritium> Any other thoughts on the forums before moving on?
<kenneth> the problem is advertising, people want use something they don't know about
<dthomasdigital> any one that has questions we need them to ask
<dthomasdigital> good point Kenneth
<protonchris> I guess I am not sure why someone would use our forums when they could use the mailing list or the general ubuntu forum.
<tritium> And some of it is personal preference.  There are many ways to seek assistance: wiki page, mailing lists, IRC, and forums.
<kenneth> definitely
<SonicSounds> +1
<protonchris> What can we offer that doesn't already exist?
<dthomasdigital> I guess what we should do is make sure if anyone from New Mexico comes to the forums we make sure they have a way to contact us.
<kenneth> the new website should help with that. be able to give a URl that people can remeber
<tritium> True.  Granted, our current wiki page also has a link to it.
<dthomasdigital> kenneth is right that will help
<SonicSounds> Maybe also we could add it as a link to the LinuxFest site?
<dthomasdigital> We could but LinuxFest is not Ubuntu Centric 
<gen_fool> Is promoted by ubuntu
<SonicSounds> David - maybe you could Twitter it?
<dthomasdigital> I will be doing some heavy twitering
<SonicSounds> you have a lot of followers :) and so that might be a good option IMHO
<tritium> I'm not sure how high-priority the forums are at this time.
<dthomasdigital> tritium, your right just if anyone sees a reason to post, then post....keep them active.
* deinerson1 (n=chatzill@c-68-35-135-32.hsd1.nm.comcast.net) has joined #ubuntu-us-nm
<tritium> Welcome back, deinerson1.
<tritium> dthomasdigital: let's keep that in mind.  Will you introduce item 3?
<deinerson1> thx, had to reboot :|
<dthomasdigital> sure give me a second
<dthomasdigital> Hey guys look we are giving away stuff http://abqonthecheap.com/
<dthomasdigital> Not sure if this will generate traffic but I saw an opportunity.
<protonchris> looks good
<tritium> Agreed.
<dthomasdigital> We have tons of disk, stickers and other stuff all the time we could do this a lot more if we just knew about it.
* thompson (n=thompson@nmd.sbx06442.losalnm.wayport.net) has joined #ubuntu-us-nm
<tritium> Hello, thompson.
<dthomasdigital> http://nmlinuxfest.ning.com/ some folks have clicked on the sponsor links on the fest page too
<thompson> hi
<thompson> guess I'm late... is the meeting still going?
* SonicSounds has quit ()
<tritium> Yes, thompson.
<thompson> cool.  what is the current topic?
<tritium> I think we'll move on to item 4:
<tritium> thompson: agenda here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NewMexicoTeam/March_10_2009
<thompson> thanks
<tritium> Item 4: David Thomas will be interviewed on the next Ubuntu Podcast.
<dthomasdigital> Scary
<dthomasdigital> No one can make fun of my okie accent
<protonchris> Wow, stardom.
<tritium> dthomasdigital: put in a good word for us
<protonchris> What will you be talking about?
<dthomasdigital> I'm going talk about protonchris and his BBQ sensor
<protonchris> lol
<dthomasdigital> Oh I'm going to say that the NM LoCo is fantastic with fantastic members and the right attitude to get things done.
<tritium> And gen_fool's attic antics
<gen_fool> BBQ sensors rock
<protonchris> dthomasdigital: great.  congrats.
<tritium> Yes, congrats, dthomasdigital.
<gen_fool> +1
<dthomasdigital> Well we really are making a name for ourselves and we got to keep the momentum going and it's a real team no doubt about it.
<thompson> When does it air?  --thought about the phrase, sounds old school...but I'm sticking with it.
<dthomasdigital> Thursday 7:00pm our time.
<dthomasdigital> I'm skypeing it in
<gen_fool> tomorrow?
* SonicSounds (n=phil@67.99.198.2) has joined #ubuntu-us-nm
<gen_fool> I mean day after
<thompson> dthomasdigital: awesome...have  a good show
<dthomasdigital> thanks on to the next item?
<tritium> Sure.
<protonchris> +1
<dthomasdigital> +1
<SonicSounds> +1
<Doomcat> ok
<dthomasdigital> So I've been thinking about a game night
<dthomasdigital> Only Doomcat can't come he would win
<Doomcat> What!?
<protonchris> Sounds good to me.  I like watching Doomcat frag dthomasdigital
<gen_fool> Has to be a game old farts can play
<Doomcat> Ill go easy on everyone.
<tritium> I will come to watch the fragfest.  I'm not a gamer, but I'll sit back and enjoy the entertainment.
<kenneth> Urban Terror
<dthomasdigital> I'd love it to be starcraft
<gen_fool> +1
<dthomasdigital> Tell you what I work out some details and come up with a day and see what we can do
<protonchris> +1
<dthomasdigital> sound good?
<tritium> Sure.
<gen_fool> gen_fool looks up starcraft
<tritium> OK, next item is mine: Launchpad Team created for the Ubuntu New Mexico LoCo Council
<Doomcat> kenneth:I like urban terror i think we should do that  or starcraft i like them all.
<tritium> NM LoCo Council (dthomasdigital, protonchris, jimrz, gcleric, tritium) have a new launchpad team: https://launchpad.net/~nmlococouncil
<Doomcat> great.
<tritium> It was requested by protonchris, as it will be useful for the web hosting to have an administrative team.
<dthomasdigital> looks very good, thanks for all the work on that tritium
<protonchris> It makes permissions on the website easier.
<tritium> dthomasdigital: no worries, buddy
<protonchris> Initially council members will be able to do whatever they want on the drupal install.
<tritium> Oops...I accidentally deleted everything.
<protonchris> Exactly
<dthomasdigital> oh great
<tritium> :D
<protonchris> It is a starting point and we can adjust as necessary.
<dthomasdigital> cool
<tritium> protonchris has been putting a lot of hard work into the new website.
<tritium> Thanks for your efforts, protonchris.
<dthomasdigital> It's going to be awesome
<gen_fool> +1
<tritium> Also, dthomasdigital -- your efforts often go unrecognized.  Thanks for always updating meeting minutes, and all your hard work on the wiki.
<protonchris> Last item is a website update.  We ran into a snag with the openid modules.  I emailed our webhost to see if we can get to the bottom of the problem.
<dthomasdigital> What about the case badges?
<tritium> Yes, http://www.zareason.com/shop/product.php?productid=16197&cat=0&p
<tritium> Anybody want to order some aluminum case badges?
<tritium> $5 for 11, with free shipping.
<dthomasdigital> Really I'm down for 10.00 when do we order?
<protonchris> Whoops.  Sorry.  I skipped over the case badge item ;)
<tritium> Any time.
<tritium> No worries, protonchris.  :)
<protonchris> I would like a few badges.
<tritium> Show of hands?  Who all is interested?
<tritium> +1
<protonchris> +1
<gen_fool> I would prefer a fat bumper sticker for my truck
<SonicSounds> +1
<dthomasdigital> Or do we just order ourselves now we have the cool links
<tritium> gen_fool: we can do another ubuntu shop order too
<Doomcat> +1
<tritium> That's true.  There's no reason we have to order as a group.  We can make individual orders.
<gen_fool> +1
<tritium> Anyway, I at least wanted to point out that website to the group.
