== Profile Roulette ==
This page will host the North Carolina Team Profile Roulette! Get your wiki pages ready, and then head over to <nowiki>[[NorthCarolinaTeam-CategoryNorthCarolinaTeamProfile]]</nowiki> to learn how to add your profile pages to the roulette list. We will start the roulette in a couple of weeks, once a good number of profiles have been added to the list.

<nowiki>[[cwill747]]</nowiki> will update the page every day.
