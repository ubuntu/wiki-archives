== New Mexico Linux Fest ==
This page has been created for the organization of the first annual New Mexico Linux Fest. If you have any ideas, a wish list, or have event organization experience please contact us. We will be looking for speakers, sponsors and exhibitors.

==== Committee ====

We have put together a committee to explore the idea of starting a Linux Conference in New Mexico along the lines of the <nowiki>[[http://www.ohiolinux.org/|Ohio LinuxFest]]</nowiki>. If you have ideas, would like to serve on the committee or know of ways that would help including locating sponsors. Please contact any of the current committee members. <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MichaelRimbert|Michael Rimbert]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Jimrz/|Jim Riordan]]</nowiki>,<nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/dthomasdigital|David Thomas]]</nowiki>

We are hoping to learn from others most notably <nowiki>[[http://linuxfestnorthwest.org/|Linux Fest Northwest]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[http://www.ohiolinux.org/|Ohio Linux Fest]]</nowiki>, and the <nowiki>[[http://www.onlinux.ca/|Ontario Linux Fest]]</nowiki> as well as many others. We've taken the liberty of using much of the ideas, verbiage, and organizational skills of these organizations to help make the New Mexico Linux Fest successful. Thanks to all they do.  

==== Organizational Chart ====

This will be a non-profit and free to attendees festival. However we may need to create banking accounts or create a non-profit, 501(c)3 corporation to pay for various needs  and therefore full transparency must be maintained. We will need a group of officers to handle various task.

* President
* Vice-President
* Treasurer

Please bring your own network cables (50'), extension cords (25'), and power strips. Also, please avoid the use of large display lights.

This is a call for presentations on all aspects of Linux and open source technology. We welcome both introductory lectures and advanced discussions on software development, database, server application, networking, and system administration topics.

Lecture slots will be 60 or 90 minutes long. Please adjust your lecture length to fit your time slot, and leave time for a question and answer period afterward.

A DHCP network connection to the Internet will be available for each presentation . An overhead projector will also be available.
