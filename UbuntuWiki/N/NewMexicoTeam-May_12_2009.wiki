<pre>
<sithlord> I was kicking around the Idea of having a free night at my cyber cafe for linux gaming
<sithlord> oh ok
<nick125> sithlord: Where's your cyber cafe at?
<dthomasdigital> sithlord I think we would agree to that!
<sithlord> near 4th and osuna
<nick125> Ah.
<dthomasdigital> What's the name?
<nick125> dthomasdigital: I still remember the last LAN party...heheh
<dthomasdigital> nick125 sorry bout that
<sithlord> internet express but its inside a cricket store viva wireless
<nxion> I havent been to a LAN party since Gamma used to go on at New Horizons in Alb
<nick125> I'm not much of a gaming fan anyways :)
<sithlord> I want people to discover the games that can be played on linux
<dthomasdigital> Just installed Quake 4 this week, damn fine fun
<gen_fool> nick125,  I am not either, another chance to get together and root on the kids :)
<sithlord> cool, I finally got my C & C zero hour to work perfectly
<doomcat_> I got quake wars and doom 3 to run on linux just demo on quake wars but full doom 3 (i like modding it and playing it no mods) It rocks!!!!
<gen_fool> sithlord,  who gets to use the 36" crt?
<gcleric> whoohoo.. got ubuntuone working... had to kill it's sync-daemon.
<sithlord> lol, use it for noobs to get them addicted to linux
<nxion> Ubuntu One looks awesome
<nxion> I signed up today for the beta
<gen_fool> That thing is huge, ...
<sithlord> and weights a ton
<sithlord> I want to load old atari style games
<gen_fool> I have a 32" tv and am happy takes 2 people to carry
<dthomasdigital> Should we get started we have a small agenda tonight https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NewMexicoTeam/May_12_2009
<sithlord> I know if people see that they can get them for free, then they will switch
<sithlord> ok
<protonchris> Looks like I have item one.
<dthomasdigital> The floor is yours protonchris
<protonchris> Birdhouse has installed the necessary software for running drupal with the loco-drupal modules.
<gcleric> gen_fool: a few years back I got a free 32" while loading it into my car I dropped it on my pinky finger...shattering the Proximal phalange.
* fgleich (n=fgleich@97-123-104-79.albq.qwest.net) has joined #ubuntu-us-nm
<fgleich> hi all
<protonchris> In the future, it might be possible to use the canonical hosting, but their version of drupal is older and the loco-drupal modules are being backported.
<gen_fool> Hello fgleich
<gcleric> howdy fgleich!
<doomcat_> hello fgleich
<fgleich> hi gen_fool , gcleric , doomcat_
<protonchris> I suggest we stick with birdhouse since they have bent over backwards for us.
<protonchris> Only thing left is to switch the dns to point to birdhouse.  I will get tritium to help with that (he knows the admin)
<dthomasdigital> sounds good to me +1
<protonchris> After that we should be good to go.
<protonchris> openid logins work and we have a special launchpad group for people with edit/write access on drupal.
<dthomasdigital> Does this mean I have to learn drupal?
<mneptok> protonchris: be sure to let me know if there's anything else you need from Scot
<protonchris> It probably wouldn't hurt, but for basic stuff it is pretty self-explanatory
<protonchris> mneptok: Yeah, I need to get in touch with him and thank him, but the last couple of weeks have been crazy.
<mneptok> protonchris: i'll pas that along
* mneptok speaks to him a few times per week
<protonchris> Scot, the admin of birdhouse, has been great.
<protonchris> mneptok: give him a big kiss for us.
<mneptok> with tongue?
<sithlord> ewwwww
<protonchris> Yeah, if that is what he likes.
<gen_fool> ouch
<dthomasdigital> For those of you that think there is no gaming for linux http://savage2.com/en/main.php
<mneptok> for those of you that want to play great games, get a console :P
<sithlord> oh, there is thought
<mneptok> dthomasdigital: any update on pictures from the release party?
