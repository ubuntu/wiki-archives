Hello there,

I'm trying to organize the Ubuntu New Jersey Local Community team, and I wanted to know if anyone from your LUG would be interested in working with us.

The goal of a Ubuntu Local Community team is to promote Ubuntu use in their state. Tasks generally include:
* Advocating use of Ubuntu to local governments.
* Facilitating the use of Ubuntu (usually Edubuntu) in local schools and educational institutions.
* Advocating for Ubuntu at Microsoft events (ex: the Vista launch)
* Organizing events to promote the use of Ubuntu (ex: Install-fests)

Please pass this information on to members of your LUG and ask if they would like to help us out with our efforts. I will be trying to organize an in-person meeting in the near future for everyone to meet and discuss what we'd like to accomplish as a team. Let me know if you'd like me to speak about Ubuntu and LoCo teams at a future meeting, and hopefully we'll be able to arrange a time to do so.

Regards,

Joe Terranova
