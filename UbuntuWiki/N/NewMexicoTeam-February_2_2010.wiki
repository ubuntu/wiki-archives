<jimisrvrox> wireless chipset
<mneptok> Realtek wireless chipset?
<jimisrvrox> RaLink
<mneptok> that loosk like some kind of encoding issue. UTF8 vs ISO9xxx
<mneptok> did this same chipset work previously?
<jimisrvrox> yeah it has worked before but ive had probs with it since 8.10
<jimisrvrox> of course I should have documented what I did but failed to do s
<jimisrvrox> so*
<jimisrvrox> at first I figured it was a driver problem
<mneptok> have you tied booting to an older kernel?
<mneptok> *tried
<jimisrvrox> well no I am not exactly knowledgeable..but I had somebody tell me the other day to get the karmic backport wireless package..
<jimisrvrox> did that and rebooted and it did nothing for me
<jimisrvrox> what I could try though is because I learned the other day that you can boot into multiple kernels in grub...
<jimisrvrox> boot into a different kernel in grub I suppose..
<mneptok> that's what i mean by "boot to a previous kernel"
<mneptok> and try booting off a Live CD
<mneptok> is this a laptop?
<jimisrvrox> no desktop
<jimisrvrox> and ive just about wanted to boycott the liveCD
<jimisrvrox> burned 3 iso's...1 with bad MD5 and 2 with good MD5 hash..
<jimisrvrox> none of them worked...Error reading boot cd I/O
<mneptok> did you MD5 the .iso you downloaded?
<jimisrvrox> finally got an internet connection and upgraded using upgrade manager
<jimisrvrox> let me reboot and I'll try a different kernel..
<jimisrvrox> brb
<mneptok> survey says .... !
<jimisrvrox> mneptok: well I tried 3 kernels that I have
<jimisrvrox> this one...
<jimisrvrox> the next one...froze..
<jimisrvrox> last one...didnt even start up
<jimisrvrox> bad block sectors..are another prob im having
<mneptok> that's bad.
<jimisrvrox> yup
<mneptok> could well be your hard drive is going south
<mneptok> and every moment you use the machine inches you closer to catastrophic data loss
<jimisrvrox> idk
<mneptok> do you have another machine in the house?
<nick125> uh oh
<jimisrvrox> hey nick
<nick125> Hello.
<jimisrvrox> hey mang I'll brb im gonna go smoke a cig..are you good with wireless stuff?
