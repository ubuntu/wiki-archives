=== October 2010 Team Meeting Agenda ===
* '''Final Planning for Launch Party Support'''
** Rochester
** Syracuse
** New York City
* '''Discussion about NYSCATE preparations'''
* (please add your items)
* '''Verify List of Project contributions'''
     Alan Nordman suggests setting up a list of items and users that will be maintained for upcoming events.  For example, there was a suggestion of a newsletter.  This project should be defined as to what users will be maintaining it, when time can be devoted to completing the project, and when it should be finalized.

* '''Organize team calendars to define project work periods'''
     Alan Nordman suggests that we share calendars, like Gmail, to better arrange for collaboration on projects and events.  Not sure if we can just use the team calendar or if we should have individualized calendars but this will help establish when time can be allotted.
