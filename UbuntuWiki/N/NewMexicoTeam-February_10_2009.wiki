'''Topics Discussed'''

* EPC Router and Mesh Network install Postmortem. Including Full cost of project.

  Install went very well. deinerson1 reports that as of yet no major problems and the residents are not reporting any issues. EPC will hold a meeting and let the residents know when the old network is being shut down and give them instructions on how to connect to the new mesh network.

* Lets start planning the Ubuntu 9.04 Jaunty Jackalope Release Party (i.e when, where and  dead line for marketing/getting the word out.)

  We started getting the ball rolling on the next release party, talked about flyer's, locations, and dates.

* Talked about a new website, and who would like to be webmaster.
