	===	#ubuntu-us-nm https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NewMexicoTeam
	<tritium>	Hi, deinerson1.
	<deinerson1>	hello, tritium :)
	<tritium>	How is everyone this evening?
	<genfool>	Hi all, fine here....hope all is the same :)
	<tritium>	Doign ok here. I'm just quite tired.
	<tritium>	Doing*
	<genfool>	:) is like that
	<genfool>	any more thoughts on the gun & knife show?
	<kenneth_>	working on it,
	<deinerson1>	I would like to take on the privilege of updating the NewMexicoTeam wiki site. I have noticed it could use a current pair of willing hands. Not sure how the approval process works, but am certainly willing to learn.
	<nick125>	deinerson1: What approval process?
	<tritium>	deinerson1: there's no formal approval process
	<tritium>	(or informal, for that matter)
	<nick125>	Just don't do anything that makes a big change.
	<deinerson1>	gotcha - I am thinking mainly of just adding current events, IRC mtgs, that sort of thing
	<tritium>	Wow, thanks, deinerson1.
	<nick125>	deinerson1: In honestly, just do it.
	<protonchris>	Hello. Sorry I am late.
	<tritium>	Hi, protonchris.
	<kenneth_>	the only problem is i don't have feb 13 off
	<protonchris>	deinerson1: Go for it.
	<deinerson1>	I will start experimenting - I am fairly good with wiki's.
	<tritium>	That's awesome.
	<protonchris>	deinerson1: and don't worry if something gets screwed up, we can always go back to a earlier revision ;)
	<deinerson1>	ok, will do.
	<protonchris>	The gun & knife show is over Valentine's Day. Hilarious.
	<protonchris>	Now I know what the wife and I are going to do.
	<protonchris>	Any business tonight?
	<tritium>	No agenda items.
	<tritium>	firefox sure is having fun crashing every few minutes tonight
	<genfool>	ff working fine here 3.5.6
	<tritium>	genfool: let me know how 3.6.7 does for you
	<tritium>	3.5.7, rather
	<genfool>	lol
	<tritium>	You've not installed the security update, it would appear.
	<tritium>	kenneth_: I got my Chumby One yesterday.
	<genfool>	sooo, Eeb. 13 is on a Saturday.....Is any one else interested in obtaining a table and hanging out....handing out disc ??? I will get the update when it gets in portage :P
	<tritium>	genfool: ah, I had assumed you were running ubuntu 9.10 ;)
	<genfool>	I refuse grub2
	<protonchris>	Well gents, I am going to cut out of here early. I am dog tired. Have a good night.
	<tritium>	I'm rather tired myself.
	<deinerson1>	good night, prontochris
	<tritium>	genfool: how come?
	<deinerson1>	it gives your pc grubs :) I have an older friend who got karmic and every time he asks for help he says his pc has grubs. It cracks me up.
	<tritium>	haha
	<genfool>	I believe grub2 will be replaced with the original...on next release. I can wait
	<nick125>	That seems like a silly decision.
	<genfool>	I just do not want to deal with the uuid # manually setting up my existing drives
	<tritium>	Why would you have to do that?
	<nick125>	Grub2 is much better than Grub.
	<genfool>	you guys are going to make me try it .....
	<tritium>	Ubuntu has been using UUIDs for several releases now, even before switching to grub2.
	<genfool>	genkernel has, for that matter. I have a mixture of kernels not using uuid and a couple using uuid grub handles them well grub2 I will be putting it all back together. If ubuntu 9.10 is the only one using grub2 as default and will drop it ????
	<tritium>	I don't understand your question, genfool.
	<genfool>	I think grub2 for me is a bad idea, will create hours of work understanding how it works and how to modify.. And ubuntu on the next release, will drop grub2 never was a question.
	<nick125>	genfool: Where does it say that Ubuntu will drop grub2?
	<tritium>	I've not encountered that rumor anywhere.
	<genfool>	Busted :( I have only heard that, because of all the issues on the ubuntu forums. That it was posted there.... I do not have a link....I still am not ready for grub2 till I have to.....BOYCOT GRUB2! FTW!
	<genfool>	or not :)
	<nick125>	I highly doubt they would drop a superior solution (Grub2) for something that's....inferior (Grub).
	<tritium>	Interesting. What kind of issues are people having with grub2?
	<deinerson1>	no trouble here after I learned how to do in it what I could in the older version
	<fgleich>	what the heck is causing all those dings and dongs on this machine ?
	<fgleich>	hi guys, btw
	<deinerson1>	hi
	<genfool>	Using grub, I do not have any. You can check the forums for grub issues...see what comes up.
	<fgleich>	go back to lilo
	<genfool>	Hey fgleich
	<fgleich>	hey genfool
	<genfool>	fgleich, remembers lilo?
	<nick125>	I suspect that most grub2 issues are likely not because of grub2, but rather configuration issues.
	<fgleich>	all of a sudden my machine started going 'ding dong ding ding !'
	<fgleich>	<----lilo king
	<fgleich>	<----lilo king extraordinaire
	<fgleich>	It's dingy, I tell you !!!
	<deinerson1>	okay, gotta go...Bootz (my dog) is demanding to go outside. Good night all
