'''Proceedings'''

Meeting started at 8:00pm by tritium

'''Topics Discussed'''

* EPC Router and Mesh Network install Feb 7th at 10:00am -- Any Last minute items needed? 
  
Looks like we have every thing ready for the install.

* Ubuntu wiki document day on Feb 12th join in on the fun all day being coordinated on IRC Freenode channel #ubuntu-locoteams
   
On the 12th go to IRC channel #ubuntu-locoteams and help update the Local Communities wiki pages.
  
* New Mexico Linux users groups, and Commercial Linux resources on our wiki. Any more to add or remove?
   
Decided to only list non-profits and LUGS, however we would like to see if commercial groups would like to sponsor the LinuxFest in some way.
 
* Who needs case badges or stickers? Need any copies of 8.04 LTS?

Drop dthomasdigital an email and he will get you all the stickers and case badges you need.

The big news from the meeting is that tritium put in an official request to have a New Mexico LoCo website hosted by Cononical our web site would be nm.ubuntu-us.org
