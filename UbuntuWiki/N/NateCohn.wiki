== About Me ==

I am a 21 year old student living in Florida. I am going to school to be a chef but I love computers. I have been a Linux user since 2000 starting out with Red hat. I moved to Ubuntu recently from Fedora Core 6 and I find Ubuntu to be a much nicer distro. 

Member of the FloridaTeam Loco
