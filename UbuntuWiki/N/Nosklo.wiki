== About Me ==
I'm a 27 years old Computer Science and Free Software student. I live in Belo Horizonte, Brazil.
I have started using free and open source software in 1997, and now I am a big supporter of the free software community/movement. I help in many social projects, i.e. the ONG Moradia e Cidadania's LTSP centre where many people with low financial condition and digital exclusion are learning about free software and how to use it.
