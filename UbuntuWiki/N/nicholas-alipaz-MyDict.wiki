 3DACCEL:: 3D Acceleration works with proprietary nvidia drivers
 EXTDESK:: Extended desktop works in Twin View only, with nvidia drivers.  Untested with Ubuntu proprietary drivers
 904HIB:: Upon either hibernation or suspension the laptop's backlight turned off, when resuming the backlight would not turn back on despite reboots. The only solution was to reset the bios (turn computer off, unplug, remove battery pack, press and hold the power key for 15 seconds, put computer back together and start as normal). 
 910HIB:: Upon suspend the laptops backlight was dimmed, and did not return to the proper setting when resuming. The fix was to just do a Fn+F6 until it reached it's original brightness. However the issue that occurred with resetting the bios did not happen the way it did in 9.04&lt;&lt;FootNote(&#64;904HIB&#64;)&gt;&gt;
