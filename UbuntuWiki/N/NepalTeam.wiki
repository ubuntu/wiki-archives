== Welcome! ==

<nowiki>[[File:ubuntu-np192x192.png]]</nowiki> 

Ubuntu-np LOCO supports Ubuntu desktop users in Nepal. The volunteers can give Ubuntu users online support either through mailing list, IRC or through physical meetup. Overall, the Gnu/Linux distribution is growing at the moment and the teams will focus on Ubuntu users as our primary goal is to establish a point of contact for Nepali Ubuntu Linux users. 

=== What is NepalTeam? ===

Anyone who is interested in using Ubuntu Linux, contributing in Ubuntu and Open source Community can take part in this Team. Please insert your names below if you are interested in helping out. Please talk to us at #ubuntu-np or mail your details to ubuntu-np@lists.ubuntu.com if you are in Nepal and want to be part of this community. We're in search of Ubuntians who can accomplish something. 

=== Why join? ===
The members of Ubuntu-np are what make the Ubuntu Nepal team happen.

You can also have an official say in the ubuntu-np group, and vote on decisions made.
