Hi, I'm a 23 years-old french guy frome Nice (Côte d'Azur). I presently live in Brest, Brittany, and I'm graduating in Service Marketing from the Institute of Business Administration of Occidental Brittany (Brest, France) this year (2010). I use Ubuntu since Dapper, I think.
The marketing team activities are starting to tackle with problems I've often thought about when trying to apply my skills to Ubuntu, so I'm following them closely.
