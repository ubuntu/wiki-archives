I've been a Linux user off an on for many years.  I recently discovered the Ubuntu project, and I am trying to find ways to help myself and others better understand and use it.

You may contact me via private message on the Ubuntu forums.

I am also trying to get involved in #ubuntu-doc irc, so you may find me lurking there.
