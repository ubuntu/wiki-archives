__TOC__

I have been using Ubuntu for over a year on a desktop machine at home, basically as a hobby. I am 77 years young with an active brain and come from the world of business and research. I would like to see Ubuntu play a bigger part in helping small businesses and organisations in the Voluntary Sector and will test and promote, where I can, any suggested software.

Linux appears to lack any accounting and payroll software suitable for those areas of interest and I know there would be a lot of interest if such software became available either as open source or commercially at a reasonable price. I would like to open discussion on this topic and would welcome suggestions and recommendations.
