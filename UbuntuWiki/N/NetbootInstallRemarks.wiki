=== Netboot Install Remarks ===

'''Installing Ubuntu on a laptop (IBM X31) without drives through netboot install.'''

The basic steps are explained in the Netboot Install Howto

'''Assumption''': You're firewalled and will not expose services used for this exercise to the world. You have a reasonable (cable) network connection.

The slightly different scenario caused some adjustments, which I'd like to share here.

=== Scenario: ===

*** Cablerouter acting as dhcp server and gateway to the internet (ip: 192.168.0.1)
*** Linux box running debian to serve the bootimage through tftp and act as dhcp-boot server (ip: 192.168.0.2, hostname: debian)
*** Laptop without drives, but with network boot option in the BIOS.

=== The proceeding is: ===

*** Install <code>aftpd</code> (see InstallingSoftware): the tftpd isn't able to serve the files.
*** Download the Ubuntu netboot tar file from the Ubuntu netboot archive
*** http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/warty/main/installer-i386/current/images/netboot/
*** Unfortunately this is a warty file, I wasn't able to install hoary directly.
*** Unpack into /tftpboot ('''sudo mkdir /tftpboot'''), which is the default for aftpd '''tar -xzf pxeboot.tar.gz -C /tftpboot'''
*** a) dnsmasq: The following entry in '''/etc/dnsmasq.conf''' lets the dhcp server on linux indicate the cablerouter as default route for packets to the internet:'''dhcp-boot=pxelinux.0,debian,192.168.0.2 dhcp-option=3,192.168.0.1''' Run dnsmasq ('''sudo dnsmasq'''). 
*** b) dhcpd: The debian machine runs its own dns server (dhcpd) with the follow configuration (/etc/dhcpd.conf):

<pre>
host x31 { 
   hardware ethernet <MAC address of laptop>; 
   fixed-address <some unused IP for laptop>; 
   filename "/tftpboot/pxelinux.0"; 
   option routers 192.168.0.1; 
}
</pre>
 Run dhcpd (install <code>dhcpd</code> package (see InstallingSoftware), and launch it '''sudo dhcpd''').

*** Pressing the Access IBM button at boot time (or your equivalent on non-IBM laptops. Mostly F1, Delete, Shift-F10) lets one enter the BIOS to do a netboot (sometimes called PXE / boot ROM)    * Check the log files to see what's happening, since netboot is not very verbose: '''tail -f /var/log/daemon.log'''

... marvel as Ubuntu is installed over the net. Upgrade to Hoary as needed.
