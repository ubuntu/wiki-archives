==== Me ====
I am new to Ubuntu and really appreciate both the distribution and the goals of the Ubuntu community.  I have just started to work with the documentation which enables me to both learn about Ubuntu and also help out :) .  My background is mostly Windows based :o so I have some adjusting to do but it is most definately worth the effort.
