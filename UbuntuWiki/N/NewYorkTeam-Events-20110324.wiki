Educational Technology Day is a regional technology event that attracts over 1,600 people annually from the upstate New York region. It features local and national vendors such as Adobe, Apple, Dell, Epson, Hewlett Packard, Microsoft and many others.

While one of the primary audiences for the event is the higher education community, the event is open to all, and there is plenty of information of interest to the K-12 and business communities. You’ll be able to talk directly with major computer and technology vendors, explore educational applications, be dazzled by computer graphics and state of the art audio-visual systems, learn how technology is being used today in and outside of higher education, and see what can be expected in the coming years.
