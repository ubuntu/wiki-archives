EPC PROJECT: Tritium and I (gcleric) met with Sam from EPC.  A tentative plan has emerged to start our EPC support with their computer lab.  Right now many of the computers are running windows 98 and XP with no access to them because passwords have been lost or not shared.  Sam would like us, with assistance from EPC residents, to install Ubuntu on all PC's in the lab. There internet access and a basic LAN, wired and wireless, but they may need a securing their wireless. Tritium and I where invited to attend the residents Community Council of the residents some expressed interest in learning about Ubuntu would like to help us install and support lab's PC's.  At this point volunteers who are interested in learning how to install Ubuntu, assisting with the installs, and helping EPC residents learn, installl and support Ubuntu on their computers.  
 

'''01/10/08'''<<BR>>
EPC PROJECT: Next meeting with Sam confirmed Friday Jan 11th at 5:30pm at EPC.<<BR>>

'''01/6/08'''<<BR>>
EPC PROJECT: Scheduling next meeting with Sam as of right now there appears to be a tentative date of Friday Jan 11th at 5:30pm at EPC.<<BR>>

==== December 2007 ====
'''12/5/07'''<<BR>>
Meeting with Sam from EPC, and Eric and David from the New Mexico Ubuntu Loco. This meeting was the initial meeting setting up some exceptions and needs for both organizations. Out of this meeting came a greater understanding of what EPC does, and for EPC let them know what the New Mexico LoCo is all about. In the future the Loco will be setting up a campus network that will include a computer lab, office computers, and dorm room computers, all tied into a centralized network. Sam (the director of EPC) will be gone till January and this should give the New Mexico LoCo ample time to better organize our support structure.
