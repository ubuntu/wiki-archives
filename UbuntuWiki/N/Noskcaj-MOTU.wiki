=== About ===

I began packaging about 6 months ago, i now believe my standard of work is high enough for motu. I have done a large amount of motu work (<nowiki>[[http://ubuntu-dev.alioth.debian.org/cgi-bin/ubuntu-sponsorships.cgi?render=html&sponsor=&sponsor_search=name&sponsoree=Jackson+Doak&sponsoree_search=name|details here]]</nowiki>). As well as this i maintain a number of packages in debian, as well as being part of many teams, including pkg-xfce, pkg-gnome, and the debian QA team.
