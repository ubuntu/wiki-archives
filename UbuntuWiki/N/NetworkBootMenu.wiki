=== Summary ===

Implement a network boot menu generator that allows choosing between local boot, network installer, and thin-clients as well as custom menu entries.

=== Rationale ===

The current ltsp-update-kernels script generates a hard-coded pxelinux configuration that only is able to boot PXE.

=== Use Cases ===

* Brent is a system administrator who manages thin clients as well as conventional workstations on the same network. The workstations dual-boot as thin clients or a local operating system and are reinstalled over the network when updates are needed.

=== Scope ===

Initial implementation may only be able to support PXE capable machines, and not those using etherboot.

=== Design ===

=== Implementation ===

=== Outstanding Issues ===

=== BoF agenda and discussion ===
