=== CD Duplication and Distribution ===

Find out how much it would cost to duplicate a large quantity of Ubuntu CD's and distribute them to Non-Approved LoCo teams in the US.

10/4/2007: Sent initial queries to local CD Duplicator asking about minimum runs, packaging, and art work. 

=== Ubuntu Off The Shelf ===

The goal of Ubuntu Off The Shelf is to place Ubuntu CD's and the copies of the official Ubuntu book in every public library in Nebraska.  

==== How The Project Works ====
Beginning in the Omaha and Lincoln areas, we're contacting library officials and asking them if they would accept a donation of CD's and the Ubuntu book.  We're using the i386 Dapper CD's for Ubuntu and Kubuntu, and taking advantage of some discounts we have with O'Reilly to purchase the books.  We'll be tracking contacts and shipments in the table below.

==== Resources Needed ====
* Ubuntu and Kubuntu CD's for standard (not 64-bit) PC's.  Obtained from ShipIt or copied locally.
* Copies of the Ubuntu Book.  Currently planning on purchasing through O'Reilly for free shipping and Dave's Safari member discount. 

==== Team Personnel ====
* Dthacker (dthacker)
* karindalziel - Karin is in the process of obtaining her Master's in Library and Information Science

=== Project Critical Mass ===
In the short time I've been Team Contact, I can already see the folly of being a two person organization.  The goal of Project Critical Mass is to recruit and retain members of the team, so that the team achieves a continuous nuclear reaction of energy and talent.  My first step is to find the other Ubuntu users in this area and find out what they would like to do to help.
