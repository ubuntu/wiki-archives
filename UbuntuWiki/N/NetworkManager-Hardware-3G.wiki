__TOC__

This page is part of the <nowiki>[[3GNetworkingIntrepid]]</nowiki> effort.
You will find information relevant for various Releases of Ubuntu, not only Intrepid.

'''Contents'''

== Data Card Info ==

This page lists hardware details and test results for mobile broadband hardware (including mobile phones) for NetworkManager 0.7 3G networking testing and development.

If your device isn't listed, please add it to the table below. If it's not detected by the latest NetworkManager 0.7 from the NetworkManager <nowiki>[[http://launchpad.net/~network-manager/+archive|PPA]]</nowiki>, file a bug according to the instructions <nowiki>[[http://lwn.net/Articles/293813/|here]]</nowiki>. '''Remember to attach your lshal output to the bug report you file''' and to link to the bug report from the entry for your hardware on this page.

=== How to obtain device details ===

Many modems are internally installed in a laptop, or are rebranded/rebadged devices from other providers. They also vary in terms of their capabilities, many of which can't be discovered from the USB device IDs alone.

Some detailed instructions on how to probe your modem to find out the real manufacturer details, modem capabilities, USB vendor and product IDs, etc can be found in <nowiki>[[NetworkManager-Hardware-3G-Probing]]</nowiki>. Adding this information - particularly the capabilities string and the real manufacturer - to the "Notes" section of the entry for your device would be helpful.

=== Mobile Broadband cards ===

For mobile phones, see the next section. This list is for add-in or built-in dedicated mobile broadband modems.
