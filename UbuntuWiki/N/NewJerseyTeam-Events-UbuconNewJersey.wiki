=== Description ===

An Ubucon for New Jersey. I'm thinking August 4th (after Ubuntu Live, before people are back at school), and I'm currently looking for a location.

The goal would be to get to know other Ubuntu and Linux users, and welcome new and potential users. I'm looking for people interesting in working and organizing the event, helping with the install fest, and give talks on various Linux topics.
