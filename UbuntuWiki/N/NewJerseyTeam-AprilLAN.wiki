Dave Harding will run a Frozen Bubble tournament from 14:00 to 14:30 (or whenever we finish).  There will be a home-made trophy and  gold-colour winners icon suitable for blogging.  The runner-up(s) will get a silver-colour runners-up icon suitable for blogging.  Final scores will be posted on this Wiki.

I'm trying to hold the tournament during lunch so we can all watch and munch simultaneously. To play, you will need to arrive before 14:00 (Two O'clock) and have a recent version of Frozen Bubble installed on your computer.

We'll play using <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_system_tournament|Swiss System Tournament Rules]]</nowiki>.  "The principle of a Swiss tournament is that each player will be pitted against another player who has done as well (or as poorly) as him or herself."  We'll play enough rounds to determine a single winner.  For 5-7 players, that's three rounds.  For 8-15 players, that's four rounds.  In the Swiss System, each player plays in each round; so 15 players will play 7 matches each round for 28 total matches. If we have fewer than five or more than fifteen players (sixteen players require 40 matches), Dave may use alternative tournament rules.

Each match will consist of two players competing head-to-head until one player wins two rounds of network Frozen Bubble.
