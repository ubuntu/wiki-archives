Hi my name is <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~niall-mcguinness|Niall]]</nowiki> and I am working on a project looking at the effectiveness and usefullness of the Ubuntu community communication tools. 
I have uploaded a map of these tools and their uses and their relationships.

I hope this will be a help in some way for new Ubuntu team members to navigate around but also to let the community guage which tools are most effective, used most, and which have the most links etc.

=== Current communication tools used by the Ubuntu community include ===
FORUM, MAILINGLIST, IRC, LAUNCHPAD, WIKI, PLANETBLOG, FACEBOOKGROUP, WEBSITE, FRIDGENEWSLETTER, TWITTER, GWIBBER, IDENTI.CA

The following map shows each tool and its uses as well as its relationship or link to the other tools.

=== A semantic map of these tools ===
Following on from that, I decided to try to build a Semantic map or Ontology of this domain using an open source tool, again mapping the tools uses and relationships...any comments/criticisms welcomed :)
