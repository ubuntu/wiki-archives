==== Me ====

I'm a Frenchman, born in Nancy (Lorraine), now living in Strasbourg (Alsace).  
I enjoy listening to Pink Floyd, learning Ubuntu and cooking Italian food.

==== My job ====

After a few studying and working, I have been a freelance journalist. I now work for a major European flat screen TV manufacturer, as a marketing assistant. I also handle internet websites, the company's network and provide support to dealers with our networking related products. 

==== And Linux ====

I started using Linux a few years ago and have been using Ubuntu from the Breezy Badger. Ever since I exclusively use open source softwares in my everyday life and work. I participate in this great community as much as I can.
