=== Recap ===
The combined launch party and public information session drew roughly 30 people including people from Albany, Binghamton, Ithaca, Rochester, Syracuse and Utica. This is the first statewide loco event in team history. The crowd was a mix of current Linux users and people interested in migrating to Ubuntu from Windows. Several people were there representing their community LUGs and there was excitement expressed by many about a statewide event.
