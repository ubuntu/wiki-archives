My name is Boning Chen, a linux user and a long-time fan.

Because I do not know too much about programming, the only way for me to take part in this development is to help Translating Ubuntu and its surroundings... I participate mainly in the Simplified Chinese, Chinese (Hong Kong) and Traditional Chinese sections.
