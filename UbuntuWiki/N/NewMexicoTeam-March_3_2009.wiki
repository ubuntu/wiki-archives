==== Agenda ====

* JauntyJackalope is coming, scheduled for release in April 2009.
For every Ubuntu release we like to organize parties all over the world. At these parties everyone is welcome and we get together to celebrate, meet new friends and often introduce people new to Ubuntu to our community and our Operating System. Release parties are not only a great way to meet people but they are a lot of fun! We already have a listing on the <nowiki>[[ttps:--wiki.ubuntu.com-JauntyReleaseParties|party page]]</nowiki>.
* We got a tip of the hat from Ubuntu Podcast #20 for our EPC project
* We will be removing the commercial Linux Resources from the NM Ububtu wiki unless an argument can be made to keep them.
* Webpage status update
* A couple of protonchris' tiny projects (don't get excited)

 
If you want to add anything else to the agenda, please feel free!

'''Topics Discussed'''
<protonchris> Item #1 Jaunty release party

<dthomasdigital> So any ideas?

<protonchris> I don't think it is too early to see if someone wants to volunteer to coordinate it.

<genfool> never to early, when is the date?

<jimrz> release date scheduled for 4/23

<dthomasdigital> I'd love to but I got a lot on my plate with NMLC and NM LinixFest

<dthomasdigital> But I'll sure help 

<tritium> I'd prefer not to, with my wife nearing her due date at that time.

<tritium> (coordinate, that is)

<jimrz> I can do the coordinate thing

<protonchris> Great.  Thanks.

<dthomasdigital> jimrz let me know if you need me to help with anything

<tritium> Thanks, jimrz.

<protonchris> Let's think about where we want to have it this time.

<dthomasdigital> Oh btw my projector bit the dust, I hope I can fix it

<jimrz> dthomasdigital: sure will

<protonchris> dthomasdigital: bulb?

<genfool> can we make a list of items that need to be done , and pick them off/

<dthomasdigital> No not at all it keeps saying the filter needs changed and I did.

<dthomasdigital> sounds good genfool

<dthomasdigital> 1st location?

<protonchris> genfool: sure.  I think a wiki page would be perfect for that.

<jimrz> +1

<genfool> cool

<dthomasdigital> I'll create a page right now 

<jimrz> dthomasdigital: can you do the flyers again?

<dthomasdigital> Sure I'll look for official ones on the artwork wiki page

<genfool> poor guy  you do have enough on your plate, wish I knew more

<dthomasdigital> I'm just lucky the wife lets me get sway with it

<genfool> :)

<jimrz> :)

<jimrz> dthomasdigital: careful what you say outloud

<dthomasdigital> good point

<protonchris> Next Item: Ubuntu Podcast mention

* protonchris points to dthomasdigital 

<dthomasdigital> points to the whole gang great work and the pat on the back was fantastic

<tritium> Definitely.

<protonchris> dthomasdigital: I was pointing to you since you put it on the agenda :)

<dthomasdigital> oh, well it really shows what Ubuntu is really all about <jimrz> +1

<tritium> Not on the agenda, but along the same lines (and hopefully you've seen my post to the mailing list), but we also got named "Team of the Week" in the Community Spotlight of the latest Ubuntu Weekly News: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuWeeklyNewsletter/Issue131

<dthomasdigital> I saw, man are they butting the pressure on...now what do we do :)

<genfool> For having fun?

<dthomasdigital> genfool did the f

iberglass ever come off

<tritium> genfool: that was fun for you?  That's good!  That second attic made me claustrophobic.

<jimrz> indeed

<dthomasdigital> I'm very proud of us all big thanks to Dave at EPC and to Eric big time

<genfool> took a couple of showers, I crawl attics as a carpenter all the time. ubuntu makes it fun

<tritium> :)

<dthomasdigital> next item We will be removing the commercial Linux Resources from the NM Ububtu wiki unless an argument can be made to keep them. 

<dthomasdigital> We talked about this some time ago what do you think?

<tritium> +1

<dthomasdigital> +1

<protonchris> +1

<jimrz> +1

<dthomasdigital> Well that was easy

<genfool> I vote not present , was not there

<dthomasdigital> Ok next

<protonchris> I have started on our new website.  Take a look here:  http://nm.ubuntu-us.org

<dthomasdigital> I like, what ya useing?

<protonchris> mneptok is providing the webhosting.

<jimrz> cool

<protonchris> I still need t

o integrate the openid/launchpad logins

<genfool> looks like gnome

<tritium> It's Drupal.

<genfool> :)

<dthomasdigital> very cool I love my openid will work with it

<protonchris> I used the drupal/loco theme.

<deinerson1> prontochris: very nice!

<protonchris> I keep everyone updated.

<dthomasdigital> Any idea how you if at all will work our wiki into the page?

<protonchris> Not sure.  I haven't looked into moinmoin/drupal integration

<dthomasdigital> cool

<protonchris> I have two tiny projects to finish the meeting with.

<jimrz> shoot

<protonchris> Map of our previous events:  ht<protonchris> I am missing the f2f at source3's house

<protonchris> The next one is a work in progress .....

* nmlocobot (n=nmlocobo@c-69-254-133-134.hsd1.nm.comcast.net) has joined #ubuntu-us-nm

<tritium> protonchris: the f2f at my house, but I don't mind if it's left off

<deinerson1> prontochris: I like the map

<dthomasdigital> ohhhh what is that

<tritium> Yes, nic emap.

<protonchris> ?epcstatus

<protonchris> That is all it does so far.

<protonchris> So far I envisioned that it would useful for checking the status of the epc mesh network, but we can have it do anything.

<dthomasdigital> Release party wiki page https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NewMexicoTeam/JauntyJackalope link on the main wiki page as well.

<tritium> protonchris: ok

<protonchris> deinerson1: yeah, the epcstatus command needs to be more descriptive.

<protonchris> If we don't find the bot useful, no harm done.

<tritium> protonchris: that would be useful

<deinerson1> on the plus, those two had several days in a row last week with no outage

<protonchris> It still needs some work before it will sit in the channel all the time.

<dthomasdigital> I think the bot is a great idea I love how we keep evolving and growing, so cool

<protonchris> I am open for suggestions about other bot functions.

<deinerson1> yes, indeed

<tritium> protonchris: if you prefer to move newmexibot's planned functions (@schedule, etc.) into nmlocobot, we can do that
<protonchris> sure

* protonchris assumes newmexibot is a tritium creation?

<tritium> Yes, he has been in here before, a few weeks ago.

<genfool> protonchris: your work rocks!

<dthomasdigital> trutium and protonchris needs to teach us about bots

<tritium> protonchris wrote his own bot, whereas I just used the supybot sources that they use for ubottu

<protonchris> tritium: really?  I must of missed or forgot about it.

<tritium> So, kudos to protonchris.

<tritium> Yeah, he didn't do much yet.  I'd have to search the logs to find when.

<protonchris> Well, don't give me too much credit I found example code on the interweb.

<protonchris> I thought about putting in a special command for doomcat, but I haven't had a chance.  don't tell him.  it will be a surprise.

<dthomasdigital> He will love that, 

<tritium> Nice :)

<protonchris> It will most likely poke fun at dthomasdigital
<jimrz> :)
<tritium> protonchris: ubottu supybot sources here, if you prefer to use it: https://code.launchpad.net/~tsimpson/ubuntu-bots/tweak

<genfool> Butt you did it, You found what you needed to do the job

<dthomasdigital> protonchris great, nice to know you think about me.

<protonchris> tritium: thanks.  I'll have to take a look.  Is it written in python?

<tritium> protonchris: yes

<protonchris> That is all I have for the meeting

<protonchris> tritium: nice.

<tritium> !info supybot

<ubot3> Package supybot does not exist in intrepid

<tritium> I wonder what's up with ubot3.

<dthomasdigital> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NewMexicoTeam/JauntyJackalope page is all set up and good to go even has a table

<tritium> Description: robust and user friendly Python IRC bot

<tritium> !test

<ubot3> sigh... again? I'm busy here, I already told you it failed.

* ChanServ gives channel operator status to tritium

* ubot3 (n=ubot3@unaffiliated/nalioth/bot/ubot3) has left #ubuntu-us-nm (requested by tritium: "Go fix yourself!")
* tritium removes channel operator status from tritium

<dthomasdigital> guys headign off soon

<tritium> genfool: did I see you warning about the network-manager updates.

<protonchris> I am going to hit it.  Good night.

<tritium> Good night, protonchris.

<genfool> seems to be an issue with policy kit that is still masked

<jimrz> good night protonchris

<tritium> genfool: does it break your wireless?

<tritium> protonchris: cool projects you demoed today!

<dthomasdigital> Got to head out as well talk at you later my friends
