__TOC__

The Xubuntu website (and all of Ubuntu) currently only uses .torrent files for it's torrent downloads, this is an obsolete format, and nearly all other torrent sites (both legal only and sites that don't care) use magnet links, either solely or as well as .torrent files.

How they work:
file: link to "trackers", then downloads from a list from the trackers. 
link: uses lots of confusing algorithms to ignore the need for trackers, so no "middle man" and nothing to host, no download as well. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet_URI_scheme , http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/bittorrent-magnets-work-technology-explained/ and http://news.softpedia.com/news/BitTorrent-Magnet-Links-Explained-132536.shtml have more info.
Both methods get similar amounts of peers. Magnet links can also contain links to trackers.

Magnet links are easier to use than .torrent files and it is very likely that if someone both has a torrent client and knows what xubuntu is, the know about using magnet links.
The link may even be less confusing, because you don't download a file that some people may think is xubuntu.

Why the move away from .torrent files?

a .torrent file is a file that sits on a server somewhere. The files take up space. For somebody to share a .torrent that server must be up and available to all parties. With torrent index sites frequently under attack for their potentially illegal uses, an available server is not guaranteed.

By doing away with the .torrent files, magnet links takes the dependence of the server out of the equation. By using the magnet link, users can get information from other users directly. Additionally, by this process the user increases his or her chance of the torrent process working in case the original tracker is not public or closed.

Advantages of magnet links over .torrent files

1. Torrent index sites will have lower bandwidth and space requirements.
2. Easier to share just a link than to share a link to a file on a server.
3. Magnet links should be updated where .torrent files may not be.
4. Better chance of success even if a specific tracker is not available.
5. Ability to obtain download from alternative, non-torrent methods.

Disadvantages of magnet liks over .torrent files

1. Initially they are slower as connections are made to other peers to find the data.
2. It’s can be more difficult to download specific files using magnet links versus torrents. (this isn't an ubuntu issue as our torrents only have one file)
