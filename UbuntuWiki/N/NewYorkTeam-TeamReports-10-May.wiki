.:Structure Changes:.<<BR>>
The New York State Team removed the formal by-laws that had been established during the team origin and replaced it with an informal structure. The team lead is now the cprofitt who had been serving as the teams president since last November when elections were held. The team has also adopted the idea of re-locos from the Ohio team.
