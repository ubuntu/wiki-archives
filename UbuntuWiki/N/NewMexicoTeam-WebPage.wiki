== Introduction ==
Now that the New Mexico Team has achieved official LoCo status, Canonical will host a webpage for us.  This wiki page will serve as a place to brainstorm ideas for the webpage.  Feel free to contribute.  For more information regarding LoCo webpages, check out the LoCoCreatingWebsite page.

== Ideas ==
* Aggregator of blog posts from New Mexico LoCo Team members (similar to ubuntu planet, but just for our team)
* <nowiki>[[http://cgiirc.org/|cgi:irc]]</nowiki> linking to our irc channel.  This would allow people to join our channel without the need to install and configure an irc client.
* photo galleries of meetings, events, projects, etc.
* place date of conference prominently on the website so users can see right away without having to click one of the tabs --I'm a usability geek :)
