__TOC__

=== About me ===

I graduated as Computer Scientist in March, 2007, in the National University of Córdoba, Argentina. I've been developing open source software since 2005, using different programming languages such as C, Eiffel, Python, and technologies such as zope/plone, django, GTK+, and some more.

Python is one of the best things that happened to -the geek part of- my life, and I love working in a daily basis with it.

I'm part of the Ubuntu One team since October, 2009. I started working in the foundations+ team, improving the file syncdaemon service. After that, I was moved to the desktop+ team, where I'm working since March, 2010. Currently, I'm the Technical Leader of the aforementioned team.

I'm also a Professor Assistant at the National University of Córdoba, where I mostly teach in first and second year courses. Is worth noting that the computers in the university labs are running Ubuntu :-).
