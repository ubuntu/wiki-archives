20:09 < deinerson1_irssi> okay, i think i'm logging the mtg for the wiki
20:10 < tritium> Thanks deinerson1_irssi.  If you ever need logs, locobot_4 also logs the channel.
20:10 < tritium> protonchris: tablet?
20:10 < protonchris> tritium: that's the rumor
20:12 < tritium> Probably going to be a lot more expensive than http://news.cnet.com/8301-13924_3-10423606-64.html
20:13 < protonchris> Well, you have to pay extra for "sexy" devices.
20:13 < kenneth_> As My christmas gift to my self  joined the Linux Foundation
20:14 < tritium> I'm definitely keeping my eye on ARM devices this yaer.
20:14 < tritium> kenneth_: congrats!  You get some cool benefits with that, as I recall.
20:14 < protonchris> tritium: Yeah, I think the ARM snapdragon is going to be everywhere this year.
20:15 < tritium> I agree.
20:15 < protonchris> Who makes the snapdragon?  Might be a good company to invest in ;)
20:16 < tritium> Qualcomm, I believe.
20:16 < tritium> kenneth_: have you investigated those benefits?
20:16 < kenneth_> a little
20:17 < tritium> http://www.linuxfoundation.org/about/join/individual
20:17 < kenneth_> also the ARM cortex A9 processor
20:18 < nick125> Good evening.
20:18 < tritium> Yeah, the snapdragon is essentially a cortex A8, with some additional stuff.
20:18 < tritium> Hello, nick125.
20:19 < nick125> Qualcomm is in a weird state, to my knowledge. Do they have any LTE chipsets in progress?
20:20 < tritium> Shall we discuss the lone agenda item, as it's already 8:20?
20:21 < protonchris> tritium: sure.
20:21 < nick125> yeah, let's go for it.
20:21 < kenneth_> ok
20:21 < deinerson1> ok
20:22 < nick125> What's the progress on that?
20:23 < kenneth_> I called the organizers of the show to ask some clarifing question
20:23 < kenneth_> s
20:23 < nick125> What were those?
20:23 < nick125> (just to satisfy curious minds)
20:25 < kenneth_> does it matter who set up to request for a table ( I work on sat) - was told that it doesn't
20:25 < kenneth_> also
20:26 < kenneth_> is there a limit on how many people work the table ?
20:27 < nick125> How many people are planning on showing up? (I might not be able to)
20:27 < kenneth_> was told that the ornizers have to do tags for the dealer - as a limited numner would be perffered
20:27 < deinerson1> I cannot on the feb show
20:31 < kenneth_> give gave an estimate of 4-5 people - the orginzers said that would be ok
20:31 < nick125> kenneth_: I think that seems reasonable
20:33 < tritium> Thanks for coordinating all of that, kenneth_.
20:33 < kenneth_> also I told that this would be a Ubuntu Linux  User group - the orginazer didn't know what that wa, but didn't have a problem with that.
