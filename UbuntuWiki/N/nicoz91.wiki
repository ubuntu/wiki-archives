'''''Nathan Nhaines''''' 23/11/2021 at 9.41AM on <nowiki>[[https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/nicoz-membership-application/25381/4 | Discourse]]</nowiki> :
Nico has been a constant presence in the Ubuntu Italian forum, on IRC, and worked very hard to make sure GNOME Software is translated for Italian. He is polite, patient, and eagerly helps others where he can. He’s been involved with Ubuntu and Debian and is an asset to our community.
I’m happy he wants to continue participating the Ubuntu community and I think it perfectly reasonable to formally recognize his contributions thus far.
