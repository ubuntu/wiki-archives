The Rochester chapter of the Ubuntu-New York LoCo will be having the
Hardy Heron release party on Saturday, May 3.  We're holding it at The
Distillery at 3010 Winton Road South and meeting at 1pm at the bar.

If interested, please RSVP to hardyheron@nerdsonlinux.com so that we can
get a general idea how many people to expect.

Hope to see you there.
