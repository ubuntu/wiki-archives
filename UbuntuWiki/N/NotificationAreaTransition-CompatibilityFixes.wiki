__TOC__

Until mid-2011, we will use this page to track programs running on Ubuntu that need adjusting for <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NotificationAreaTransition|the notification area transition]]</nowiki> (as <nowiki>[[NotifyOSD#compatibility|we did for Notify OSD]]</nowiki>). This is so we can easily compare proposed design solutions, and assemble guidelines on how developers should alter any other programs. Once we’ve done that, we’ll retire this page.

=== How you can help ===

* For each program listed here that doesn’t have any issues described, examine it to see where it uses or refers to the notification area (or “tray”). For each place where it does, add a row describing it. If it doesn’t, write in “(none)” followed by your wiki signature (so we know who reviewed it).
* For each issue, ensure a bug is reported about it, and link to the bug report.
* For each bug report, ensure that it’s tagged with <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bugs?field.tag=trayaway|the “trayaway” tag]]</nowiki>.
* Help fix the bugs. :-)

=== Programs ===

http://people.canonical.com/~kees/search-status_icon.log -- needs to be converted into Moin``Moin table rows, sorted, and pasted below

http://people.canonical.com/~kees/search-qt-systemtray.txt -- needs to be converted into Moin``Moin table rows, sorted, and pasted below

http://people.canonical.com/~kees/search-eggtrayicon.txt -- needs to be converted and added to this table. There are also <nowiki>[[http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=python-eggtrayicon|Python bindings]]</nowiki> shipped in Ubuntu for this as well so any package which depends on that would also be a candidate.

| “The hot key set for Artha is Ctrl + Alt + W. Press this key combination to call Artha from the system tray. Selecting text in any window and calling Artha will pop it up with the selected text's definitions. If notifications are enabled, instead of popping up, Artha will notify the first definition of the selection. Notifications can be enabled/disabled by right-clicking on Artha's status icon on the system tray and selecting the required option. Pressing Ctrl + Alt + W actually does nothing, and so does right-clicking on the notification area item.

Choosing “Settings” opens a “System Tray Settings” window, which is a duplicate of the “System Tray Icon” tab in HP Device Manager’s own Settings window, and erroneously suggests the existence of “System tray icon messages” (“All”, “Errors and Warnings”, “Errors Only”, or “None”).

Right-click provides a context menu: "Open Dropbox Folder" (same as left-click), "Launch Dropbox Website", "Recently Changed Files" menu, disabled item indicating used space in online dropbox folder (e.g. "6.7% of 2.5GB used"), disabled item indicating sync status (e.g. "All files up to date"), Help menu (sub-items are Help Center/Tour/Forums), "Get more Space" (opens browser with info about dropbox plans), "Preferences..." (opens prefs app that doesn't appear to be accessible any other way), "Stop Dropbox". Preferences window contains various options, including this checkbox option: "Show system tray notifications". Note that nautilus-dropbox provides access to Dropbox which is similar to Ubuntu One, so perhaps we could take UI cues/recommendations from what is being done with Ubuntu One (provided there aren't any functional regressions) it has libappindicator support in it's experimental builds.
| Dev builds of dropbox use app indicators, so we probably won't need to do anything for it depending on when they release. --<nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:jorge]]</nowiki>

| truecrypt
| When running Truecrypt encryption program and mounting a volume, Truecrypt minimizes into the Systray. I have not found a way to get the Truecrypt program back again; and as consequence, cannot unmount encrypted partitions; cannot mount more volumes; basically, cannot do anything...

| "View" > "Preferences" > "Advanced Configuration" has "Close to tray" checkbox. Left click shows the window, right click brings up a menu with the options: "Preferences", "About" and "Quit". It's written in Python and uses the "gtk.StatusIcon()" object to create its tray icon.
