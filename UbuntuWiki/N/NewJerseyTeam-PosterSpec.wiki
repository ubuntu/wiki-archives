Ubuntu NJ LoCo Team Poster Specification.

Poster prototype

<nowiki>[[attachment:ubuntu-nj-poster-prototype.png|png version]]</nowiki>

<nowiki>[[attachment:ubuntu-nj-poster-prototype.svg|svg version]]</nowiki>

I've modified the poster and uploaded the new one, following suggestions by my girlfriend and <nowiki>[[Madpilot]]</nowiki> (the guy that made the original). I think the new font fits in much better with the rest of the image, and it looks better overall with less text.
