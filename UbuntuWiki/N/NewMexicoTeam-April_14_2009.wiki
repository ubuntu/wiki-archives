<jimrz> +1
<protonchris> +1
<doomcat> +1 on that
<nick125> sounds good
<genfool_> +1
<protonchris> tritium has to work.  So he won't be here tonight, but he told me to tell everyone hello.
<dthomasdigital> I'd like to table the first item till tritium and gcleric can chime in
<jimrz> +1
<genfool_> sounds good
* nick125 gets out the big pokey stick and pokes gcleric in the eye with it
<dthomasdigital> So How did the LAN party go?
<protonchris> I think we maxed out at 5 people.  We mostly just shot the breeze.
<nick125> yeah
<dthomasdigital> Hey that's pretty good,I so forgot about Easter too.
<protonchris> Aaron came by with some eeepc issues and nick125 helped him out.
<genfool_> I showed up and brought a friend, shot the breeze
<nick125> protonchris: I'd put "helped" quite lightly. We ended up with a bricked SSD
<dthomasdigital> Still never a bad time to talk about Linux
<protonchris> nick125: HeHe.  Ouch.
<nick125> That'd probably explain some of the weird quirks he was having with it, though.
* SonicSounds (n=phil@c-69-254-147-195.hsd1.nm.comcast.net) has joined #ubuntu-us-nm
<protonchris> I did pimp our release party to some of the guys at the epc :)
<dthomasdigital> Cool, 
<protonchris> SonicSounds: Are you the phil from the epc?
<SonicSounds> Not from epc, but I am Phil -- hi!
<protonchris> SonicSounds: welcome
<SonicSounds> Thanks
<genfool_> HI, phil
<SonicSounds> Howdy

<nick125> That always helps.
<dthomasdigital> I agree protonchris
<dthomasdigital> so we can do a little marketing
<ColonelPanik> Aye
<dthomasdigital> Want to talk about a booth for Solar Fiesta?
<doomcat> yes
<ColonelPanik> I will help man it, both days
<dthomasdigital> Can we put you on charge of finding out info? After all you said yo have attended before.
<protonchris> dthomasdigital: can you remind us when/where the solar fiesta is.
<dthomasdigital> http://nmsea.org/Solar_Fiesta/Solar_Fiesta_2009/index.php

<genfool_> dthomasdigital, , you know I want to help.
<dthomasdigital> Thanks all of you, as soon as I get the task list posted you all will be the first to know.

<dthomasdigital> Jimrz little ads will be perfect we just got to get a venue nailed down solid
