==== Annual Conference Information ====
Once again it is with great excitement that we welcome you back to Rochester, NY for the 44th Annual NYSCATE Conference.  Each year, the committee works incredibly hard to ensure that each experience you have is new and inspiring.  This year, we are thrilled to have an incredible line-up of internationally known keynote speakers including Sir Ken Robinson, Chris Lehmann, Elliot Soloway, Cathie Norris, David Jakes and Peter Reynolds.  The goal of this years event is to stress collegial collaborations during a very difficult budget year.
