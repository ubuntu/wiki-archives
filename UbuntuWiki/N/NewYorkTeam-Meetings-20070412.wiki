Apr 12 18:20:07 <yharrow>	samiam010203: oh ok.  I was just wondering. because Im just assuming hes a busy guy and I am not familiar if it considered a good idea to bother him about the CDs.

Apr 12 18:21:18 <yharrow>	samiam010203: ok, so I guess we will just let him know about our shipit CD request and see what he says
Apr 12 18:21:25 <samiam010203>	cool
</pre>
<pre>
Apr 12 18:21:45 <yharrow>	as you said earlier though, release party planning is an important issue
Apr 12 18:21:50 <yharrow>	so lets get on to that now
Apr 12 18:22:27 <peterp>	do we have the general setting down yet?
Apr 12 18:22:35 *	GNu_Joe has quit ("Leaving")
Apr 12 18:22:46 <samiam010203>	there is this place http://www.bcupcafe.com/
Apr 12 18:23:13 <yharrow>	peterp: I beleive so. We want to have it in a cafe, and we want to have it on Sunday the 22nd
Apr 12 18:23:29 <yharrow>	peterp: we do not yet know the specific location nor time
Apr 12 18:23:39 <yharrow>	peterp: bcup cafe is one suggestion
Apr 12 18:23:51 <yharrow>	peterp: do you have any others?
Apr 12 18:23:52 <yharrow>	btw
Apr 12 18:23:56 <peterp>	Has the bcup been contacted yet?
Apr 12 18:23:57 <samiam010203>	yharrow u also mentioned b and n
Apr 12 18:24:02 <yharrow>	we decided to have the release party in manhattan
Apr 12 18:24:26 <yharrow>	samiam010203: did you contact bcup cafe yet?
Apr 12 18:24:49 <yharrow>	I personally didnt get a chance too yet
Apr 12 18:24:55 <samiam010203>	ill call them tomorrow morning
Apr 12 18:25:09 <yharrow>	samiam010203: ok that sounds cool
Apr 12 18:25:11 <samiam010203>	and then ill get to you the info here
Apr 12 18:25:33 <yharrow>	I was going to set up an RSVP page, but I cant do that till we have a definite time and place
Apr 12 18:26:20 <samiam010203>	ill call them in the morning and tell them whats going on and inform them thats its going to be about 10-16 of us and can we use there cafe and then ill let you know whats up yharrow ok?
Apr 12 18:26:33 <yharrow>	peterp: what do you think the would be the best part of manhattan to have the  party in, if any?
Apr 12 18:26:40 <yharrow>	peterp: b-cup is in the village
Apr 12 18:26:58 <peterp>	I would have to go with the east village, seems to be the most laid back area
Apr 12 18:27:10 <peterp>	or maybe a cafe near NYU
Apr 12 18:27:21 <peterp>	I'll start searching for some
Apr 12 18:27:48 <yharrow>	peterp: that would be great, since you live there you'ld probably be able to make the best choice
Apr 12 18:28:09 <yharrow>	peterp: we are actually quite fortunate to have you on our team right in the nick of time :D
Apr 12 18:28:28 <samiam010203>	peterp u ever hang in alt.coffee?
Apr 12 18:28:40 <peterp>	I'm actually way downtown, by the brooklyn bridge so I hang out down here
Apr 12 18:28:45 <samiam010203>	cool
Apr 12 18:29:10 <peterp>	but it is usually so dead after 5 here so that is why I was thinking up by NYU
Apr 12 18:29:23 <yharrow>	peterp: oh ok, well I was just thinking that yould be more familiar with manhattan then any of us
Apr 12 18:29:24 <samiam010203>	well the b cup sounds cool
Apr 12 18:29:43 <samiam010203>	and i think they wont care about us hanging out at all
Apr 12 18:30:00 <yharrow>	samiam010203: bcup cafe is definitely an option
Apr 12 18:30:10 <peterp>	it is the best we have so far
Apr 12 18:30:20 <yharrow>	samiam010203: right now our only option :) , just trying to look for some more ideas
Apr 12 18:30:31 <samiam010203>	yes i know
Apr 12 18:30:47 <yharrow>	I think the idea of meeting near a university is a good one
Apr 12 18:30:49 <samiam010203>	but im going to call them tomorrow and ask about the 22nd if it would be cool
Apr 12 18:31:22 <yharrow>	samiam010203: ok, yeah thats a good idea

Apr 12 19:08:28 <peterp>	this place is way toooo big
Apr 12 19:08:38 <Zyrshnikashnu>	Wander around a SMALL part of the city.
Apr 12 19:08:42 <Zyrshnikashnu>	Three blocks.
Apr 12 19:08:45 <peterp>	i know i was jk
Apr 12 19:09:16 <yharrow>	Zyrshnikashnu: I think thats just a wee bit too aimless and time consuming ;)

Apr 12 19:10:27 <Zyrshnikashnu>	This is the land of opportunity! Fulfill your dreams! Go wander around the city all day!
Apr 12 19:11:05 <Zyrshnikashnu>	Recent comments claim WiFi is no more.
Apr 12 19:11:17 <yharrow>	Zyrshnikashnu: contrary to popular opinion my dream is not  to windowshop aimlessly for internet cafes ;)
Apr 12 19:11:27 <Zyrshnikashnu>	Freak.
Apr 12 19:11:30 <yharrow>	lol
Apr 12 19:11:33 <yharrow>	:D
Apr 12 19:12:07 <yharrow>	I know man,  insane in the membrane. 
Apr 12 19:12:16 <Zyrshnikashnu>	I think I'll use this site to find local spots...
Apr 12 19:13:20 <Zyrshnikashnu>	Never mind. Buffalo apparently isn't listed.
Apr 12 19:13:28 <yharrow>	shucks
Apr 12 19:13:39 <yharrow>	Zyrshnikashnu: I'm sure there are tools out there though
Apr 12 19:13:58 <Zyrshnikashnu>	Yep.
Apr 12 19:14:12 <Zyrshnikashnu>	Actually, I don't even have a laptop yet, so it hardly matters.
Apr 12 19:14:55 <Zyrshnikashnu>	Ha! Check out this quote: "It was the Iroquois who named this area "Tonawanda" after the "Swift Running Water" of the Tonawanda Creek."
Apr 12 19:15:11 <Zyrshnikashnu>	These days, you wouldn't know the creek was moving if someone didn't tell you.
Apr 12 19:15:22 <peterp>	lol
Apr 12 19:15:33 <yharrow>	peterp: place if you were walking down the street. You have to go down a few steps to enter it and the only window in the front has an iron gate on it. The interior is very modest, only contains one table and two chairs. ...
Apr 12 19:15:43 <yharrow>	lol
Apr 12 19:16:08 <yharrow>	Review: You would probably hardly notice this place...
Apr 12 19:16:32 <yharrow>	doesnt sound like much of a place for a party, although I'd prolly go there by myself
Apr 12 19:16:39 <peterp>	wooooops
Apr 12 19:17:27 <yharrow>	take a look at this though
Apr 12 19:17:27 <yharrow>	The gramstand people just opened a new cafe and store on Ave A (by 14th). There's a full menu, more teas to choose from, and a much bigger space. I spent the afternoon there (free wi-fi for all!) with my girlfriend recently, and ended up chatting with some of the staff. The owner blends his own teas. A must-try for anyone who likes teas or cozy places!
Apr 12 19:19:54 <yharrow>	lol Zyrshnikashnu 
Apr 12 19:20:35 <peterp>	oooo
Apr 12 19:20:48 <peterp>	do you have a link?
Apr 12 19:20:53 <peterp>	for the new place?
Apr 12 19:22:17 <yharrow>	http://www.gramstand.com/
Apr 12 19:22:58 <yharrow>	I just called
Apr 12 19:23:12 <yharrow>	I told him that we would be tops 20 guys
Apr 12 19:23:18 <yharrow>	does that sound right?
Apr 12 19:23:33 <peterp>	yeah
Apr 12 19:23:46 <yharrow>	in general I dunno if we would want to hold a partyt here since it seems like a really quiet spot
Apr 12 19:24:22 <yharrow>	they said the managers name is Richard, and he's going to call me back when he has a chance
Apr 12 19:24:50 <peterp>	do you think we would really be any louder than people talking back and forth with and occasional announcement
Apr 12 19:25:28 <yharrow>	peterp: not really, I guess I'm just more concerned with guys feeling like they need to keep their voices down
Apr 12 19:25:54 <peterp>	gotcha
Apr 12 19:26:44 <yharrow>	peterp: does that make sense at all?
Apr 12 19:28:31 <peterp>	yes, I see what you are saying but I feel like I would need to visit the place first to get a feel of the actual ambiance's and noise level
Apr 12 19:28:38 <yharrow>	peterp: also, do you think that there is any chance that we will have over 15 attendees if there are only 10 members who live in NY to begin with
Apr 12 19:29:08 <yharrow>	peterp: exactly, I think we should go together either tomorrow or this weekend and visit all 3 spots we spoke of
Apr 12 19:29:09 <peterp>	probably not, to be completely honest
Apr 12 19:29:28 <peterp>	alright that sounds good
Apr 12 19:29:45 <yharrow>	bcup, think, and  grandsatam

Apr 12 19:34:03 <Zyrshnikashnu>	I was considering Pace. I never applied, though.
Apr 12 19:34:23 <peterp>	I am transferring, not very satisfied with the educaiton
Apr 12 19:34:55 <Zyrshnikashnu>	So not applying was a good decision? :P

Apr 12 19:36:13 <peterp>	have you decided on a meeting place?
Apr 12 19:37:38 <yharrow>	peterp: I was trying to find the place closest to the both of us, but I give up, we can just meet at the info cafe and go from there

<pre>
Apr 12 19:42:41 <yharrow>	peterp: we need to decide on a time for the party
Apr 12 19:43:45 <peterp>	ummm
Apr 12 19:43:58 <peterp>	the 22nd is a Sunday correct?
Apr 12 19:44:04 <yharrow>	peterp: correct
Apr 12 19:44:12 <yharrow>	peterp: what time of day do you think is best?
Apr 12 19:44:25 <yharrow>	I was originally thinking evening
Apr 12 19:44:29 <peterp>	5??
Apr 12 19:46:11 <yharrow>	peterp: I would think 5 or 6 seems reasonable. I am not entirely familiar with when people would be most available
Apr 12 19:46:59 <peterp>	around 5 or 6 seems OK to me, it seems like a normal decent time
Apr 12 19:47:21 <yharrow>	peterp: someone suggested that we hold a poll, but I think that process is too slow at this point. what do you think?
Apr 12 19:48:14 <peterp>	I don't think it's to late for a poll, it's worth a shot
Apr 12 19:49:32 <Zyrshnikashnu>	Isn't there a mailing list? You could ask people to post on the forum.
Apr 12 19:49:50 <yharrow>	peterp: ok so we will hold a poll for afternoon or evening  and then we will hold a poll for 1 out of the 2 places that we decide
Apr 12 19:50:21 <yharrow>	Zyrshnikashnu: yeah I agree, we should  create a forum poll and tehn let people know about it
Apr 12 19:52:46 <yharrow>	Zyrshnikashnu: unfortunately I am not very good with mailing lists though
Apr 12 19:53:04 <peterp>	I have to go now. So yharrow 2pm at Think Coffee
Apr 12 19:53:13 <yharrow>	Zyrshnikashnu: do you think you can send out a link to a mail with a link to the poll once it is up?
Apr 12 19:53:18 <yharrow>	peterp: ok meet you then
Apr 12 19:53:21 <yharrow>	peterp: later

Apr 12 19:54:56 <Zyrshnikashnu>	Bah! I just found out that Descent 3 runs natively on Linux, but my CD is for Windows only. :(
