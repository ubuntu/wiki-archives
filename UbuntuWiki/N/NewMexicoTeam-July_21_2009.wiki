<jimrz> hi nick125
<doomcat> hey nick125
<gcleric> there is also a call for pc's and pc parts for EPC.
<jimrz> any items that are urgently needed?
<dthomasdigital> I think I have some hard drives
<gcleric> jimrz: not they are just running low...
<nick125> If I had any spare parts, I'd donate them...but..
<jimrz> thx gcleric
<jimrz> I have a couple of CRT monitors + some other misc bits and pieces
<nick125> So, what needs to be done?
<gcleric> nick125: for EPC?
<nick125> Yeah...
<jimrz> gcleric: the EPC lab comps are running hardy, are they not?
<gcleric> jimrz: they are running 8.04
<gcleric> nick125:  they are just running low on spare parts for the pc's they have.
<jimrz> ok, are we planning to upgrade to 8.10 then 9.04 or just do clean installs?
<gcleric> as to upgrading the lab.  we just need to download the Alt CD for 9.04 and use it to upgrade the PC's
<jimrz> ok
<gcleric> jimrz:  we can jump right to 9.04
<dthomasdigital> sounds like we got  a plan damn we rule.
<jimrz> gcleric: thanks for the info, I still thought you had to do it sequentially
<jimrz> nice to know
<gcleric> dthomasdigital: it's almost like we've done this before...
<gcleric> =)
<dthomasdigital> ;) gcleric
* fgleich has quit (Remote closed the connection)
<gcleric> so I'm done.
<gcleric> next item?
* fgleich (n=fgleich@c-76-113-42-129.hsd1.nm.comcast.net) has joined #ubuntu-us-nm
<doomcat> +1
<jimrz> +1
<gcleric> +1
<protonchris> +1
<dthomasdigital> So what do you folks think about the team blog idea?
<gcleric> like it.
<jimrz> +1
<protonchris> Sounds good to me
<fgleich> how does it work ?
<gcleric> need to bow out... dinner!
<nick125> I'd also like to see a NM Ubuntu user blog aggregator
<dthomasdigital> Well my only concern is I do not have the tome to write the blog and keep it up to date with team info
<fgleich> I must not have been here when it was discussed
<dthomasdigital> * time
<gcleric> laters...
* gcleric has quit ("It's better to burn out than to fade away!")
<jay4rest> A  blog aggregator makes sense
<dthomasdigital> It's great I aggregate on planet ubuntu users but it would be great if we did it on the ubuntu team, I just don't have the time to do it
<jay4rest> Can't we just drop in an RSS feed and the site do it for us?
<jay4rest> I know wordpress has that feature
<dthomasdigital> Sure not an issue of how to get it done, but who?
* doomcat thinks hard
<dthomasdigital> And we sure have to careful of the content, you know just official New Mexico Team stuff.
<protonchris> and no mono posts ;)
<dthomasdigital> We don;t have to make a decision tonight just wanted us to start to think about it.
<protonchris> I can look into aggregating using drupal.
* fgleich (n=fgleich@c-76-113-42-129.hsd1.nm.comcast.net) has left #ubuntu-us-nm ("Leaving")
<dthomasdigital> great idea protonchris
<dthomasdigital> So let's move on and next week we can talk more about a team blog, protonchris can you give us a follow up for next week?
<protonchris> Sure.
