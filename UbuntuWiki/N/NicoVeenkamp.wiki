Hi, I am Nico Veenkamp. I live in a small town in the center of The Netherlands. 

I am a projectmanager working for a worldwide publisher of professional information (such as stuff for (tax)lawyers). My main area of work is Online business. Besides that I am very much into getting to know Ubuntu and Open Source. I plan to run my own business on this, by advising people and SME on how to use Open Source for their ICT needs.
