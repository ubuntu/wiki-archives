__TOC__

== A never ending story of upgrading ==
=== Abstract ===
This page is about my endless tries to get Lubuntu 10.10 updated to 11.04. This Abstract will only mark the most important steps I've taken so that Lubuntu-Devs are able to work with it faster and do not need to read the whole story.

=== Short Summary ===
A. System
* AMD Athlon(TM) XP 2200+ (1800Mhz)
* 1 GB RAM
* VT8373 Chip Set (VIA Technologies)

B. History 
1. started with Lubuntu 10.10 (LXDE) in Feb (no problems at installation and afterwards
2. in Apr. I wanted to upgrade to 11.04 so I fetched a copy from http://people.ubuntu.com/~gilir/lubuntu-11.04.iso (checked the MD5 == ok) after burning it with K3 the "Check CD/DVD for errors" delivered no error messages but first boot directed me directly to a login shell (no other information available)
3. tried to get another copy from a different location. Same problem as reported in 2.
4. tried to burn a copy of gilirs version from Lubuntu at another computer (MD5-Check == ok, first Boot ok == no errors found at "CD/DVD check for errors") booted it up at home => CD Check found a problem while checking for errors
5. tried several other distributions of linux (Ubuntu, Xubuntu) always with the same outcome.
6. tried Mint Linux 5 (worked) but upgrade to Mint Linux 10 was not possible
7. tried a USB-Stick Installation with Lubuntu 11.04 which I made on my Windows Laptop == System didn't find a configuration file
8. burned a copy of current Mint Linux 10 at work == pre installation check delivered no errors == update worked so i am on Mint Linux now.

| NRWlion: jmarsden : here i am
|-
| [08:38]
| jmarsden: NRWlion: OK... I know roughly what I am looking for but have not found it yet...
|-
| [08:38]
| NRWlion: jmarsden take your time. have stuff to do
|-
| [08:39]
| jmarsden: OK.  Meanwhile, if you boot from the Lubuntu 11.04 CD and select the "Install Lubuntu" option does it work and get you to the "Welcome" screen?  (Don't go all the way through the installer, obviously!)
|-
| [08:39]
| NRWlion: jmarsden just got a pop up that might be useful ... its called busy box
|-
| [08:43]
| NRWlion: jmarsden: you know what the following lines mean: (initramfs) mount: mounting /dev/loop0 on //filesystem.squashfs failed: Input/Output error Can not mount /dev/loop0 (/cdrom/casper/filesystem.squashfs) on //filesystem/squashfs
|-
| [08:44]
| jmarsden: NRWlion: Yes, they mean your machine could not read that file from the CD-R, basically.  Sounds like a bad CD-R or a failing CDROM drive.  Can you reliably run the "Test this CD" thing and get it to report no errors?
|-
| [08:45]
| NRWlion: jmarsden : affirmative tested it on two different pc at my work
|-
| [08:45]
| jmarsden: NRWlion: What about on *this* PC?
|-
| [08:45]
| NRWlion: jmarsden : freezing system now
|-
| [08:45]
| NRWlion: last time i tried it delivered no errors
|-
| [08:59]
| NRWlion: jmarsden : still there?
|-
| [08:59]
| jmarsden: Yes.
|-
| [09:00]
| jmarsden: If you can't run the "test this CD" item, and the CD is good... then chances are high the machine has some sort of hardware issue, as far as I know.
|-
| [09:00]
| NRWlion: jmarsden : thought the same
|-
| [09:00]
| jmarsden: NRWlion: Do you have a spare CDROM drive from another PC to swap in, in case that helps?
|-
| [09:01]
| NRWlion: jmarsden : thats a negative
|-
| ...
|-
| [09:12]
| NRWlion: and i will go back to bed for an hr or two because i am awake since 3.40 am utc
|-
| [09:12]
| jmarsden: :) It is after midnight here, I need to go to bed soon too...
|-
| [09:12]
| jmarsden: Goodnight NRWlion
|-
| [09:13]
| NRWlion: jmarsden : hope i helped you a little bit
|-
| ...
|-
| [09:13]
| jmarsden: NRWlion: well, we have a bug report and *something* is unhappy with your PC and that Lubuntu 11.04 CD... so that's a start :)
|-
| [09:14]
| NRWlion: anything i can do atm?
|-
| [09:14]
| jmarsden: Probably not, unless you can burn Lubuntu 10.04 and 10.10 CDs and see if they work or fail in the same way on that PC?
|-
| [09:15]
| jmarsden: And add what you have tested and the results to your wiki page about this, so we do not forget what you tested already tonight :)
|-
| [09:21]
| NRWlion: jmarsden : top 1 nearly impossible ^^ ran out of blank cds on the last try ^^ but top 2 is possible
|-
| [09:21]
| NRWlion: will copy our convo into it
