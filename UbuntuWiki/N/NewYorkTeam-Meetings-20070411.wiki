Apr 11 19:06:14 <samiam010203>	first meeeting should be in the city

Apr 11 19:06:57 <yharrow>	            Cafe (wifi would be good)

Apr 11 19:06:57 <yharrow>	#
Apr 11 19:07:13 <yharrow>	bullets dont translate too well I guess
Apr 11 19:07:22 <samiam010203>	yup
Apr 11 19:07:54 <samiam010203>	so what about a cafe?
Apr 11 19:08:15 <samiam010203>	you guys could do it in an cafe downtown in the village
Apr 11 19:08:32 <yharrow>	thats what I was thinking too, since it seems like the easiest choice
Apr 11 19:08:59 <samiam010203>	now there is an dunkin doughnuts on 11th and 2nd that has free wifi
Apr 11 19:09:09 <yharrow>	lets go through the requirements for each location though
Apr 11 19:09:16 <yharrow>	so we can get an idea
Apr 11 19:09:40 <samiam010203>	cool
Apr 11 19:09:43 <yharrow>	Cafe - wifi, and enough room for a party
Apr 11 19:09:46 <samiam010203>	yes
Apr 11 19:09:47 <yharrow>	also
Apr 11 19:10:01 <samiam010203>	then the dd is out because its a small place
Apr 11 19:10:09 <yharrow>	It would have to be the kind of cafe, where they may not mind a little noise
Apr 11 19:10:28 <yharrow>	ok
Apr 11 19:10:30 <samiam010203>	i would recomend you try that place i was telling u about a while ago
Apr 11 19:11:11 <yharrow>	barnes and nobles?
Apr 11 19:11:30 <samiam010203>	yes that would work
Apr 11 19:11:38 <samiam010203>	in astor place
Apr 11 19:11:39 <yharrow>	it would seem a little akward though
Apr 11 19:11:48 <yharrow>	and I dunno if we can get away with it
Apr 11 19:11:49 <samiam010203>	not really they wont bother us
Apr 11 19:12:04 <yharrow>	its a library though
Apr 11 19:12:19 <yharrow>	i mean bookstore
Apr 11 19:12:22 <samiam010203>	yes
Apr 11 19:12:29 <samiam010203>	and people hang there all the time
Apr 11 19:12:45 <yharrow>	I don't think they'd appreciate if we held  aparty on their grounds
Apr 11 19:12:55 <yharrow>	and.. we'd have to be kinda quiet I think
Apr 11 19:12:57 <samiam010203>	maby call them first and ask
Apr 11 19:13:16 <samiam010203>	http://www.auscillate.com/wireless/manhattan/
Apr 11 19:13:31 <yharrow>	its definately a possibility but I wouldnt make it our first choice
Apr 11 19:13:51 <samiam010203>	http://auscillate.com/wireless/manhattan/location/6065/
Apr 11 19:13:57 <samiam010203>	b cup cafe
Apr 11 19:14:17 <samiam010203>	http://www.bcupcafe.com/
Apr 11 19:14:34 <yharrow>	well, before we go through any other options, I just want to finish the list of requirements for each spot, does that sound ok?
Apr 11 19:14:42 <samiam010203>	cool
Apr 11 19:15:18 <yharrow>	ok. so any other requirements for cafe, besides for, wifi, lots of room, and tolerance of noise?
Apr 11 19:16:00 <samiam010203>	so u call the cafe beforehand and say what were going to bve doing and ask them if they dont mind hosting us for the event
Apr 11 19:16:45 <yharrow>	that sounds like a good idea 
Apr 11 19:17:08 <samiam010203>	so do u want me to call them ?
Apr 11 19:17:20 <yharrow>	well, i meant for any cafe in general.
Apr 11 19:17:24 <samiam010203>	cool
Apr 11 19:17:46 <samiam010203>	also you should make a reservations page on the wiki for people to sign that r coming to the party
Apr 11 19:17:53 <yharrow>	but yeah you can call just to ask, probably better not to confirm yet though
Apr 11 19:18:08 <samiam010203>	so if the cafe has questions about the number of people you could email them the link to the page
Apr 11 19:18:12 <yharrow>	great idea
Apr 11 19:18:14 <yharrow>	!
Apr 11 19:18:23 <samiam010203>	thanks
Apr 11 19:18:43 <yharrow>	will do that soon as meeting is over :)
Apr 11 19:19:00 <yharrow>	ok
Apr 11 19:19:07 <yharrow>	next option
Apr 11 19:19:14 <yharrow>	resturaunt
Apr 11 19:19:35 *	Zyr[afk] is now known as Zyrshnikashnu
Apr 11 19:19:40 <yharrow>	I think that a restaraunt would be similar to a cafe
Apr 11 19:19:43 <samiam010203>	i dont think thats a good idea because a strait up restarant wont want to tollarate a bunch of people hanging out
Apr 11 19:19:51 <yharrow>	I agree
Apr 11 19:20:13 <yharrow>	so it would need to be a really casual restaurant
Apr 11 19:20:19 <samiam010203>	yes
Apr 11 19:20:31 <yharrow>	hey Zyrshnikashnu 
Apr 11 19:20:35 <Zyrshnikashnu>	Hello
Apr 11 19:20:39 <samiam010203>	some place that would let us just hang out and chat with laptops all over the place
Apr 11 19:21:03 <samiam010203>	hey Zyrshnikashnu
Apr 11 19:21:04 <yharrow>	Zyrshnikashnu: your just in time for the feisty pary planning meeting
Apr 11 19:21:12 <yharrow>	party*
Apr 11 19:21:16 <yharrow>	;)
Apr 11 19:21:24 <Zyrshnikashnu>	I'm not anywhere near NYC. :P
Apr 11 19:21:29 <samiam010203>	paR-TA!
Apr 11 19:21:50 <yharrow>	Zyrshnikashnu: you can still help plan :P
Apr 11 19:22:07 <yharrow>	Zyrshnikashnu: we'll list your name in the closing credits ;)
Apr 11 19:22:13 <Zyrshnikashnu>	Grand
Apr 11 19:22:30 <yharrow>	yep
Apr 11 19:22:42 <yharrow>	Zyrshnikashnu: what part of ny are you from btw?
Apr 11 19:22:48 <Zyrshnikashnu>	Buffalo
Apr 11 19:23:01 <yharrow>	awesome, buffalo's a great place
Apr 11 19:23:12 <yharrow>	I ought to take a trip up there some day
Apr 11 19:23:41 <yharrow>	ok
Apr 11 19:24:03 <yharrow>	Zyrshnikashnu: right now we are going through types of places we can meet
Apr 11 19:24:27 <samiam010203>	yharrow i think we could start at a cafe and then  end thge night at a restarant for evening meal. hows that sound?
Apr 11 19:24:30 <yharrow>	we already discussed a cafe, which seemed like a decent option
Apr 11 19:24:42 <Zyrshnikashnu>	Indeed.
Apr 11 19:24:44 <yharrow>	samiam010203: definitely a possibiilty
Apr 11 19:24:56 <yharrow>	samiam010203: in which case, we would be breaking down the party into parts
Apr 11 19:25:01 <samiam010203>	yes
Apr 11 19:25:23 <samiam010203>	the feisty part at the cafe and the mello part at the restarant
Apr 11 19:26:10 <yharrow>	samiam010203: greeting, and then, acitivity followed by supper/ supper followed by acitivity
Apr 11 19:26:24 <samiam010203>	yes
Apr 11 19:26:41 <yharrow>	which do you think appeals more? supper first or activity first?
Apr 11 19:26:51 <samiam010203>	we could do cafe then evening meal then bar for beer
Apr 11 19:27:03 <yharrow>	and should we or should we not have supper? we could just have snacks
Apr 11 19:27:10 <samiam010203>	snacks is cool
Apr 11 19:27:18 <yharrow>	Zyrshnikashnu: what do you think?
Apr 11 19:27:46 <Zyrshnikashnu>	Sorry, I'm multitasking here. :P
Apr 11 19:28:00 <yharrow>	ok
Apr 11 19:28:14 <Zyrshnikashnu>	Snacks are best. They can be eaten while messing with computers.
Apr 11 19:28:31 <samiam010203>	that makes a lot of sence
Apr 11 19:28:32 <samiam010203>	true</pre>

<pre>
Apr 11 19:28:41 <yharrow>	I think it would also help if we knew what time of day we were meeting and what day
Apr 11 19:28:49 <yharrow>	and might hlep us decide on a place
Apr 11 19:28:57 <yharrow>	it might*
Apr 11 19:29:14 <samiam010203>	how about sat 21st
Apr 11 19:29:28 <yharrow>	saturdays are difficult for me
Apr 11 19:29:33 <samiam010203>	sunday then
Apr 11 19:29:41 <yharrow>	Sundays are good
Apr 11 19:29:53 <samiam010203>	that parts up to you yharrow because ill still be in florida
Apr 11 19:30:02 <yharrow>	I think the Sunday following the release is a good date
Apr 11 19:30:07 <samiam010203>	cooll
Apr 11 19:30:09 <yharrow>	yeah, good point
Apr 11 19:30:09 <samiam010203>	cool
Apr 11 19:30:52 <yharrow>	What do you think about meeting on a weekday when many people are off (easter) vs meeting on a weekedn?
Apr 11 19:32:25 <yharrow>	samiam010203: I think sunday is good
Apr 11 19:32:29 <samiam010203>	cool
Apr 11 19:32:36 <yharrow>	 samiam010203, we need a time though
Apr 11 19:32:41 <yharrow>	for starters:
Apr 11 19:32:47 <samiam010203>	thats up to u yharrow
Apr 11 19:32:52 <samiam010203>	whats best for u
Apr 11 19:32:54 <yharrow>	morning, afternoon or evenening?
Apr 11 19:33:05 <yharrow>	samiam010203: there are others involved too, thats the problem
Apr 11 19:33:20 <samiam010203>	what u do is put a poll on the wiki
Apr 11 19:33:40 <samiam010203>	and we can also discuse it tomorrow night at the meeting when there is more poeple here
Apr 11 19:33:45 <yharrow>	samiam010203: that's what I'm thinking, I dunno how to do it though
Apr 11 19:34:04 <samiam010203>	do a poll in the forums
Apr 11 19:34:12 <yharrow>	samiam010203:  ok
Apr 11 19:34:14 <samiam010203>	there u can do it easyly
Apr 11 19:34:32 <samiam010203>	and tomorrow tell people to go to the poll and vote
Apr 11 19:34:43 <yharrow>	samiam010203: lets in the mean time try to pick a time when most ppl are available, Im thinking evening is good
Apr 11 19:34:48 <yharrow>	or afternoon
Apr 11 19:34:51 <yharrow>	not sure though
Apr 11 19:35:15 <samiam010203>	sounds good yharrow
Apr 11 19:35:20 <yharrow>	if we do it at evening, there might be less peopel around
Apr 11 19:35:24 <yharrow>	does that make sense?
Apr 11 19:35:31 <samiam010203>	put it in the poll
Apr 11 19:35:41 <samiam010203>	time / place/ day
Apr 11 19:36:24 <Zyrshnikashnu>	Put up three polls.
Apr 11 19:36:30 <samiam010203>	smart idea
Apr 11 19:36:48 <Zyrshnikashnu>	How many of our NY users are in the NYC area?
Apr 11 19:37:12 <yharrow>	well, I would but we need to start considering options for the  party, so I think we should just make it simple and have it on sunday, and vote for time
Apr 11 19:37:17 <yharrow>	what do you think?
Apr 11 19:37:23 <samiam010203>	sounds good
Apr 11 19:37:29 <yharrow>	do we have enough time to make many polls?
Apr 11 19:37:29 <samiam010203>	vote on the time and cafe
Apr 11 19:37:34 <samiam010203>	yes
Apr 11 19:37:49 <samiam010203>	make the poll tonight and tell poeple about it at tmorrows meeting
Apr 11 19:38:22 <yharrow>	ok, and we'll do that then. lets discuss our other options for meeting places then
Apr 11 19:38:28 <samiam010203>	cool
Apr 11 19:38:38 <yharrow>	Zyrshnikashnu: I think about 9</pre>
<pre>
Apr 11 19:39:07 <yharrow>	ok, next option is private party
Apr 11 19:39:28 <samiam010203>	ok
Apr 11 19:39:30 <yharrow>	I don't know anyone in the team who lives in manahttan, so thats prolly out
Apr 11 19:39:42 <yharrow>	since we decided to have it in manhattan
Apr 11 19:39:51 <samiam010203>	i think a cafe is a good place to start
Apr 11 19:40:20 <yharrow>	samiam010203: we prolly will have it in a cafe, I just wanted, to exhaust all my options before I came to that conclusion ;)
Apr 11 19:40:29 <samiam010203>	ok
Apr 11 19:40:48 <yharrow>	samiam010203: ok so cafe, does look like the best choice right now
Apr 11 19:40:57 <samiam010203>	ok
Apr 11 19:41:13 <samiam010203>	so now we just have to put it in the poll for the best time
Apr 11 19:41:53 <yharrow>	samiam010203: now, the remaining issues are 1. Which cafe? 2. What will we do. 3. What will we serve. 4. How will we pay. 5. How many people will attend?
Apr 11 19:42:11 <yharrow>	2. what will we do, meaning which activites will we ahve

Apr 11 19:44:53 <yharrow>	sounds like fun. Too bad for us though
Apr 11 19:45:01 <samiam010203>	we could not do it at that place anyway becasue they dont let u use the sockets to plug things into
Apr 11 19:45:17 <yharrow>	heh, thats not very good

<pre>
Apr 11 19:52:56 <yharrow>	heres a link to a review of the cafe http://www.menupix.com/nyc/restaurants.php?id=306576
Apr 11 19:53:23 <Zyrshnikashnu>	Ack! I always forget that Chatzilla won't open a new tab for links,
Apr 11 19:53:42 <yharrow>	Zyrshnikashnu: what does chatzilla do for links?
Apr 11 19:53:49 <yharrow>	open in same page?
Apr 11 19:53:53 <Zyrshnikashnu>	Yes.
Apr 11 19:54:02 <Zyrshnikashnu>	So whatever I have open is lost.
Apr 11 19:54:07 <yharrow>	do ctrl+left click 
Apr 11 19:54:16 <yharrow>	or middle click
Apr 11 19:54:21 <Zyrshnikashnu>	That opens a whole new window. :P
Apr 11 19:54:26 <yharrow>	not for me
Apr 11 19:54:37 <Zyrshnikashnu>	Middle works.
Apr 11 19:54:45 <yharrow>	cool
Apr 11 19:55:06 <Zyrshnikashnu>	Handy. It should probably inherit its settings from the main app, though.
Apr 11 19:55:46 <yharrow>	anyways, I'm thinking, that maybe we should decide whether we have a preference for any particular town in manhattan
Apr 11 19:56:32 <Zyrshnikashnu>	I've been to Manhattan once, so I'm not much help there.
Apr 11 19:56:47 <yharrow>	If we know which neighborhood we want to have our meeting in we can do a search with http://www.menupix.com/nyc/index.php
Apr 11 19:56:54 <Zyrshnikashnu>	I have no idea what "the Village" is. :P
Apr 11 19:56:58 <yharrow>	hehe
Apr 11 19:57:13 <yharrow>	Zyrshnikashnu: I live in NYC and I only have some Idea
Apr 11 19:57:14 <yharrow>	lol
Apr 11 19:57:22 <yharrow>	Zyrshnikashnu: I pretty much stay in queens
Apr 11 19:57:37 <yharrow>	could be greenwich village though
Apr 11 19:58:11 <yharrow>	Zyrshnikashnu: the other things we need to discuss are what will we do at the meeting? and how will we pay?
Apr 11 19:58:25 <Zyrshnikashnu>	Out of your pockets. :P
Apr 11 19:58:45 <yharrow>	yeah I was thinking that we will pay for our own meals or buy snacks and split
Apr 11 19:58:54 <yharrow>	split the total cost i mean
Apr 11 19:59:09 <Zyrshnikashnu>	Didn't someone have the idea to get a school to help? Did that go anywhere?
Apr 11 19:59:23 <yharrow>	yeah someone had that idea, I need to get back to them
Apr 11 19:59:30 <yharrow>	I think I emailed them
Apr 11 19:59:45 <yharrow>	I am waiting for a response though
Apr 11 19:59:47 <yharrow>	as for activities, 
Apr 11 19:59:56 <yharrow>	what ideas do you have?
Apr 11 20:00:01 <yharrow>	I'm thinking, install fest
Apr 11 20:00:08 <Zyrshnikashnu>	I need to either join or establish a LUG at U of Rochester when I go next year so we can do these things with school finds.
Apr 11 20:00:27 <Zyrshnikashnu>	Sure, but installing will only take a little time.
Apr 11 20:00:30 <Zyrshnikashnu>	Hopefully.
Apr 11 20:00:32 <Zyrshnikashnu>	:P
Apr 11 20:00:42 <yharrow>	Zyrshnikashnu: you can make an extension of the Loco team if you want
Apr 11 20:01:21 <Zyrshnikashnu>	The clubs there are all fully supported by the school, which is awesome.
Apr 11 20:01:21 <yharrow>	Zyrshnikashnu: lets say 2 hours tops
Apr 11 20:01:34 <yharrow>	Zyrshnikashnu: sound reasonable?
Apr 11 20:02:05 <Zyrshnikashnu>	I suppose so.
Apr 11 20:02:05 <yharrow>	We need to decide How long we want the meeting to be
Apr 11 20:02:16 <yharrow>	what do you think is a decent duration?
Apr 11 20:02:19 <Zyrshnikashnu>	Until everyone gets tired and leaves.
Apr 11 20:02:53 <yharrow>	Zyrshnikashnu: well there will be a certain amount of planned activities and then we will just kinda hang out till ppl leave
Apr 11 20:03:08 <Zyrshnikashnu>	Hmm...
Apr 11 20:03:14 <Zyrshnikashnu>	Activities, activities...
Apr 11 20:03:19 <yharrow>	Zyrshnikashnu: does that make sense?
Apr 11 20:03:20 <Zyrshnikashnu>	LAN games. :P

Apr 11 20:04:14 <yharrow>	jk_: and you didnt miss it, we are still going 
Apr 11 20:04:24 <Zyrshnikashnu>	All two of us.
Apr 11 20:04:29 <jk_>	sweet
Apr 11 20:04:47 <yharrow>	jk_: I'm doing great, and Ill be doing even better after we have a better idea of what the release party wil lbe like ;)
Apr 11 20:04:47 <yharrow>	haha
Apr 11 20:04:48 <yharrow>	yeah
Apr 11 20:04:54 <yharrow>	allll 2 of us
Apr 11 20:04:58 <yharrow>	now 3
Apr 11 20:05:00 <jk_>	so you guys have planned taking over times square bill boards with guerilla advertising for the  release ?
Apr 11 20:05:08 <yharrow>	hmm
Apr 11 20:05:11 <yharrow>	we should advertise
Apr 11 20:05:13 <yharrow>	good point
Apr 11 20:05:14 <Zyrshnikashnu>	Nice.
Apr 11 20:05:22 <jk_>	strippers with ubuntu logos with body paint ?
Apr 11 20:05:26 <yharrow>	some kinda posters/papers or something
Apr 11 20:05:28 <jk_>	you got it all covered, right ?
Apr 11 20:05:32 <yharrow>	jk_: now your getting creative
Apr 11 20:05:46 <yharrow>	hehe
</pre>
<pre>
Apr 11 20:06:07 <yharrow>	jk_: so far the only thing weve decided are that 1. we will have the party in a cafe
Apr 11 20:06:08 <yharrow>	2.
Apr 11 20:06:14 <Zyrshnikashnu>	Set up an elaborate viral marketing scheme to propagate throughout the web in a few hours.
Apr 11 20:06:19 <yharrow>	We will most rprobably have it on sunday
Apr 11 20:06:39 <yharrow>	3. people will probably  split the cost. no sponsor as of yet
Apr 11 20:07:01 <jk_>	hmm.... how about some outdoor event where we give out live cd's ?
Apr 11 20:07:26 <yharrow>	jk_: that soiunds like an activity
Apr 11 20:07:33 <yharrow>	jk_:  great idea
Apr 11 20:07:40 <yharrow>	so so far we have 2 activities
Apr 11 20:07:44 <yharrow>	handing out ubuntu
Apr 11 20:07:48 <yharrow>	and installing ubuntu
Apr 11 20:07:55 <yharrow>	where would we get cds from?
Apr 11 20:08:02 <Zyrshnikashnu>	Drop them on parachutes from a tall building.
Apr 11 20:08:09 <jk_>	ha awesome
Apr 11 20:08:10 <yharrow>	sal just told me that shipit is now taking orders fro feisty
Apr 11 20:08:12 <jk_>	that'd be sweet
Apr 11 20:08:22 <yharrow>	lol @ Zyrshnikashnu 
Apr 11 20:08:58 <jk_>	i wonder if there's any ubuntu "presence" in the universities in nyc .. nyu, columbia, etc.
Apr 11 20:09:02 <yharrow>	Zyrshnikashnu: if a penny can make a dent in the concrete, can you imagine what an ubuntu cd would do?
Apr 11 20:09:15 <Zyrshnikashnu>	Parachutes!
Apr 11 20:09:19 <Zyrshnikashnu>	And not THAT tall.
Apr 11 20:09:26 <yharrow>	Zyrshnikashnu: prolly make a dent or 2 in MS's  market share
Apr 11 20:09:37 <Zyrshnikashnu>	*rimshot*
Apr 11 20:10:21 <jk_>	has anyone else in any other city had great luck with getting the word out about ubuntu ?
Apr 11 20:11:36 <Zyrshnikashnu>	Haven't tried.
Apr 11 20:12:03 <Zyrshnikashnu>	Of course, my community can barely be called a "city." :P
Apr 11 20:12:13 <yharrow>	jk_:  we need methods of "getting the word out"
Apr 11 20:12:38 <Zyrshnikashnu>	How big is Central Park? My city is about 3 sq. miles.
Apr 11 20:12:40 <jk_>	right: i mean, nyc is big, there are 10 users on here right now (says xchat).
Apr 11 20:12:40 <yharrow>	jk_: it would fall under "community outreach"
Apr 11 20:12:53 <jk_>	so .
Apr 11 20:13:02 <jk_>	i wonder what the most bang for the buck is (thinking out loud)
Apr 11 20:13:17 <jk_>	this is really an aside from the cafe, sorry
Apr 11 20:13:26 <yharrow>	bang for the buck in which regard?
Apr 11 20:13:48 <yharrow>	jk_: what would you like to purchase>?
Apr 11 20:13:49 <jk_>	single targeted event resulting in the greatest increase in awareness
Apr 11 20:14:38 <yharrow>	jk_: hmm, well, I think we should start out with and installfest and work from there, although you can do a little experimentation at the release party too
Apr 11 20:14:46 *	Zyrshnikashnu_ (n=zyrshnik@pool-71-126-1-105.bflony.east.verizon.net) has joined #ubuntu-ny
Apr 11 20:14:54 *	Zyrshnikashnu has quit (Nick collision from services.)
Apr 11 20:15:09 *	Zyrshnikashnu_ is now known as Zyrshnikashnu
Apr 11 20:15:23 <yharrow>	jk_: what kind of methods do we have available to us?
Apr 11 20:15:29 <Zyrshnikashnu>	The trouble always comes to funding, doesn't it? It's hard to advertsie without funds, and most of us are not independently wealthy.
Apr 11 20:15:41 <jk_>	well it's also a question of target
Apr 11 20:16:01 <jk_>	students, pedestrians, academics, artsy folks, tech people ...
Apr 11 20:16:06 <yharrow>	jk_: if we are clever, and we fundraise as well, money will not be an issue
Apr 11 20:16:07 <jk_>	business people ...
Apr 11 20:16:44 <yharrow>	jk_: excellent point!. we must define target audience
Apr 11 20:16:47 <jk_>	my issue with install fests has always been that it's sort of preaching to the choir
Apr 11 20:16:51 <jk_>	specifically:
Apr 11 20:17:09 <jk_>	an install fest is by its very nature picking basically "tech folks"
Apr 11 20:17:16 <Zyrshnikashnu>	Indeed.
Apr 11 20:17:22 <jk_>	hot chicks ?
Apr 11 20:17:23 <jk_>	no
Apr 11 20:17:27 <jk_>	business people ?
Apr 11 20:17:28 <jk_>	no
Apr 11 20:17:40 <jk_>	students?  well ... maybe the D&D crowd
Apr 11 20:17:43 <jk_>	(no offense to them)
Apr 11 20:17:58 <Zyrshnikashnu>	There are no hot chicks in the NYC regions of NY LoCo? :(
Apr 11 20:18:09 <jk_>	:\
Apr 11 20:19:05 <yharrow>	jk_: I think that the equivilant of an installfest but for the masses would be to hand out cds, with a support phone number on the back
Apr 11 20:19:13 <jk_>	yea
Apr 11 20:19:19 <Zyrshnikashnu>	I've really got to finish modifying this Chatzilla motif. I can't see most of the smileys and such.
Apr 11 20:19:36 <jk_>	i mean, the ideal end result is to get a larger percentage of people using ubuntu at home, right?
Apr 11 20:19:45 <jk_>	probably "at home", not "at work" , right ?
Apr 11 20:19:58 <yharrow>	most people don NOT want to stand there while some stranger installs a foreign operating system on their laptop
Apr 11 20:20:11 <yharrow>	:D
Apr 11 20:20:26 <jk_>	right but at the same time, most people probably ALSO do not feel comfortable re-installing their whole OS themselves
Apr 11 20:20:27 <Zyrshnikashnu>	Heh.
Apr 11 20:20:44 <jk_>	hence the power of vista-on-factory-installs . . .
Apr 11 20:21:10 <jk_>	here's the problem
Apr 11 20:21:10 <yharrow>	jk_: which is why handing them a cd with a support number is the best solution, since its not just a business card, its somthing solid
Apr 11 20:21:14 <Zyrshnikashnu>	Supposedly Dell is going to be shipping more models of computers with some distro or another pre-installed.
Apr 11 20:21:19 <jk_>	windows: 0 install.  it comes installed
Apr 11 20:21:30 <jk_>	linux: you have to install something (fear! horror!)
Apr 11 20:21:41 <yharrow>	plus
Apr 11 20:21:42 <yharrow>	get this
Apr 11 20:21:45 <yharrow>	its a livecd
Apr 11 20:21:52 <jk_>	right that's true
Apr 11 20:21:54 <yharrow>	= 0 install
Apr 11 20:21:56 <yharrow>	:D
Apr 11 20:21:56 <jk_>	that's a beautiful thing
Apr 11 20:22:01 <yharrow>	if they want it installed
Apr 11 20:22:05 <yharrow>	they call number
Apr 11 20:22:06 <yharrow>	we come
Apr 11 20:22:08 <yharrow>	poof
Apr 11 20:22:12 <Zyrshnikashnu>	Not bad.
Apr 11 20:22:30 <yharrow>	worst comes to worst they throw the cd out
Apr 11 20:22:41 <Zyrshnikashnu>	Except for the few that panic when a foreign operating starts when they boot up with the LiveCD. :P
Apr 11 20:22:47 <yharrow>	but at least theres a chance they will be exposed to name branding and or system
Apr 11 20:22:52 <Zyrshnikashnu>	*operating system
Apr 11 20:23:03 <yharrow>	Zyrshnikashnu: we should hand out the cds with a manual as well
Apr 11 20:23:27 <Zyrshnikashnu>	Or a hidden camera.
Apr 11 20:24:18 <yharrow>	Zyrshnikashnu: lol
Apr 11 20:24:21 <jk_>	this is really the crux of it though.  in order to get more penetration, people will probably have to install linux on their home machines.
Apr 11 20:24:32 <jk_>	that -- for your average user -- is an enormous act of bravery
Apr 11 20:24:39 <yharrow>	Zyrshnikashnu: I think we could stop at the manual, not all MS users are spies
Apr 11 20:25:02 <jk_>	it's almost like this:
Apr 11 20:25:05 <Zyrshnikashnu>	jk_: Especially since it involves repartitioning etc.
Apr 11 20:25:10 <yharrow>	jk_: which is why need to guide them
Apr 11 20:25:12 <jk_>	you want to stand outside of the place in NYC that sells the most PC's and laptops
Apr 11 20:25:19 <jk_>	whichever place that is.  it can be found out
Apr 11 20:25:37 <jk_>	and when people walk out install linux for free for them
Apr 11 20:25:40 <yharrow>	what we really need, is some viral marketing
Apr 11 20:25:45 <jk_>	of course ... that probably violates warranties or something
Apr 11 20:25:54 <jk_>	yharrrow: agreed
Apr 11 20:26:20 <yharrow>	jk_: I was played with idea of creating sub-teams within our team
Apr 11 20:26:40 <yharrow>	jk_: such as a marketing team, support team, art team and so on
Apr 11 20:26:50 <jk_>	it would be worth reaching out to comp sci profs in nyc
Apr 11 20:27:08 <yharrow>	jk_: where again in NY do you live?
Apr 11 20:27:27 <jk_>	if they can be convinced that -- say -- edulinux or edubuntu or whatever the hell it's called is a Good Thing that their students should use
Apr 11 20:27:33 <jk_>	that could be some real traction
Apr 11 20:27:40 <jk_>	jackson heights
Apr 11 20:27:47 <yharrow>	NK?
Apr 11 20:27:48 <jk_>	(williamsburg transplant !)
Apr 11 20:27:52 <yharrow>	BK?
Apr 11 20:27:53 <jk_>	queens
Apr 11 20:27:58 <yharrow>	awesome
Apr 11 20:28:01 <yharrow>	I live in queens too
Apr 11 20:28:01 <jk_>	(i know, it's no bklyn)
Apr 11 20:28:04 <Zyrshnikashnu>	Isn't Edubuntu geared more toward teachers of young students?
Apr 11 20:28:22 <yharrow>	yharrow: around flushing
Apr 11 20:28:26 <jk_>	zy: regular ubuntu whatever.  i just mean: classrooms could be a good place to start
Apr 11 20:28:32 <Zyrshnikashnu>	Indeed.
Apr 11 20:28:34 <jk_>	in terms of return on hours dedicated to the task
Apr 11 20:29:42 <jk_>	how about this
Apr 11 20:29:48 <yharrow>	I was thinking just now, that if we can pull off this release party succesfully, it will do wonder s towards getting our team officially recognized
Apr 11 20:30:31 <jk_>	we write up an email -- get the ubuntu nice nice marketing on it -- for nyc comp sci profs telling them about the new version coming out and about the party
Apr 11 20:30:40 <jk_>	it's sort of "current events" from their perspective
Apr 11 20:33:01 <jk_>	yharrow let me know what I can do for the release party
Apr 11 20:33:07 <jk_>	buy party hats, whatever
Apr 11 20:33:14 <jk_>	you have my email ?
Apr 11 20:33:38 <yharrow>	jk_: well we are trying to decide right now
Apr 11 20:34:00 <yharrow>	jk_: the problem is that we are not completely certain what we want to do at the party
Apr 11 20:34:42 <yharrow>	jk_: we are fairly certain that it will take place on sunday, in the morning to evening, and that it will take place in manhattan at a cafe
Apr 11 20:34:57 <yharrow>	sunday the 22nd that is
Apr 11 20:35:20 <Zyrshnikashnu>	Arbor Day. :P
Apr 11 20:35:23 <Zyrshnikashnu>	Plant a tree.
Apr 11 20:35:52 <yharrow>	jk_: well technically speaking, by spreading ubuntu, we are planting a tree... of hope :D
Apr 11 20:36:23 <Zyrshnikashnu>	I am Zyr, not jk.
Apr 11 20:36:29 <Zyrshnikashnu>	Pay attention. :P
Apr 11 20:37:22 <yharrow>	Its Arbor day! Come Plant a tree ... of Hope. Join us today at the cafe in manhattan and be part of one of the most momentous event in the history of the software market
Apr 11 20:37:33 <jk_>	i'll put it on my calendar</pre>
