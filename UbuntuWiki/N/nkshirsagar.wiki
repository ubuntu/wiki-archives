=== About Me ===

Nikhil Kshirsagar

I spent the first 10 years of my career being a Linux userspace programmer, developing C/C++ storage based applications for various flavors of Linux. My first purely open-source related job was when I began working at Red Hat as a storage SME (SEG) in 2015, and have used Linux exclusively since then. During this role I got acquainted with several folks in the upstream community, particularly in the domains of performance and storage. This role led me to submit several upstream contributions, and I also presented talks at conferences like DevConf and PCPConf on topics like Modern C++, block layer caching, performance monitoring and LVM2. 

Among the distributions I have used on my personal machine at various times are RHEL 7+, Debian, Fedora and Ubuntu. (all releases since xenial)

I joined the SEG team at Canonical in July 2021, working on escalated cloud as well as platform storage issues. I  became familiar with the Debian/Ubuntu universe, including from a packaging point of view, as I took over the role of the maintainer of the sosreport apt packages in Ubuntu from slashd. I work on multiple levels of the storage stack at Canonical, helping Ubuntu customers/users resolve issues related to juju charms, ceph, bcache, lvm, device-mapper, multipath and the kernel.
