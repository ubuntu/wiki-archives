<doomcat> +1
<dthomasdigital> I have a signed up for an official team again this year for software freedom day.
<jimrz> cool...need to figure a really good location this year
<dthomasdigital> we got to get a better location this year.
<gcleric> dthomasdigital: not mention get the word out early.
<dthomasdigital> I'll contact cotton wood mall int he next few days and get some info
<dthomasdigital> Yes much more advertising this year
<jimrz> si
<dthomasdigital> I'll start a project page on the wiki
<doomcat> good idea
<ColonelPanik> http://softwarefreedomday.org/  This?
<dthomasdigital> yes
<ColonelPanik> Thats the day I am doing Lindependence in Portales, NM
<dthomasdigital> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Software_Freedom_Day%3A_September_20%2C_2008
<jimrz> nice timing
<ColonelPanik> I will wrap the two together and make it real!
<jimrz> this year,s is Sept 19
<dthomasdigital> ColonelPanik I'll see about getting you some swag, set up a team in Portales
<jimrz> :)
<ColonelPanik> Gracias amigo
<dthomasdigital> I don't have any details yet but I wanted to get an early start on SFD 2009
<jimrz> yep, last year was fun but definitely need more exposure to the general public
<gcleric> Mall..
<dthomasdigital> Plus a perfect time to promote LinuxFest
<dthomasdigital> +1 on gcleric's idea
<jimrz> that, too ;)
<doomcat> perfect place
<gcleric> Which Mall?
<jimrz> good question
<dthomasdigital> Cotton Wood I would think
<dthomasdigital> Working on getting some banners made for the fest with luck will have them before SFD
<gcleric> I think Cottonwood would be the better choice.
<jimrz> Cottonwood probably has the most traffic and the best demographics, but it is also the least centralized and hardest one to get at the traffic in
<gcleric> Should we call and see if there is a fee?
<dthomasdigital> We can put Doomcat in a sandwich board having him walk the mall :)
<gcleric> I've seen public stuff near the elevators.
<jimrz> probably a good idea and find out what, if any, their rules are
<dthomasdigital> I was planning to contact them as NMLC as we are registered as a non-profit
<gcleric> cool.
<dthomasdigital> As soon as I get some info I'll post it. But for this to work it's going to take a  little more planning than in years past.
<jimrz> believe you are right
<gcleric> dthomasdigital: agreed.   I'll help if needed.
<jimrz> +1
<doomcat> +1
<ColonelPanik> Some of you could come over to Portales?

<gcleric> dthomasdigital: fyi... Daneil Robbins now is hosting his own sub gentoo based distro...Funtoo.
<dthomasdigital> There will be a page like this on all the distribution's wiki's so everyone will have distro specific info
