Print this out ('''not the thumb!''' one of the ones below! :) ) and flyer for it by you (keep in mind this is mostly meant to be a South Jersey Event). Please check the printer margins and make sure it comes out right; it was meant to have 1/4 inch margins all around. If you print in adobe or otherwise, don't let it automatically resize; if your printer requires 1/2 margins on the bottom, print it upside down.
