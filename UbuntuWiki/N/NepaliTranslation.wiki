== Overview ==

This is the home page for Ubuntu Nepali translations.

Our intention is to maintain a central communications channel for ne_NP based languages. Generally, this includes the forms of Nepali spoken in Nepal and  <nowiki>[[IndianTeam|India]]</nowiki>

These variants are almost identical in their written forms, so it makes sense for some communication and co-operation to take place. We hope to eliminate the duplication of effort that is currently taking place in regards to translations.

Our translations are based on <nowiki>[[https://translations.launchpad.net/ubuntu/karmic/+lang/ne_NP|Nepali]]</nowiki>. That effort is headquartered <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-l10n-ne|here]]</nowiki>. Essentially, we are producing an internationalised form of ne_NP.

We do not intend to restrict the activities of local translation groups, but rather to provide a common base for everyone to build upon. Through co-operation, we hope to strengthen rather than weaken localised versions of Nepali.

== How to Participate ==

Joining the Ubuntu Nepali  Translators team allows you to commit translations and vote on policies. If you are not a member, your contributions will need to be approved by a member. The procedure for joining is as follows.

# Sign up for a <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/|Launchpad account]]</nowiki>.
# Make your e-mail address visible on your Launchpad homepage so that we can get in touch with you. If we cannot contact you, you cannot join.
# Apply to join the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-l10n-ne|Ubuntu Nepali Translators team]]</nowiki>
# Sign up to the <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-l10n-ne| l10n-ne mailing list]]</nowiki>
# An Administrator should e-mail you. Reply to their message.

The team is moderated, meaning that you need to be approved by an Administrator before you are allowed to join. Membership is dependent upon:

* adequate command of the written Nepali language to qualify as a translator
* ability to contribute constructively and work as a team under the leadership of the Administrators
* following established guidelines and directions
* remaining contactable via the mailing list

Don't let these requirements scare you off, though. Provided you have decent written Nepali language skills, you will likely be admitted.

== Communication ==

Our primary communications channel is our <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-l10n-ne|mailing list]]</nowiki>.

== Tools ==

=== Table of translations ===
The bulk of our translation effort is simple word substitution. To streamline this process and to maintain consistency, we are compiling a <nowiki>[[NepaliTranslation-WordSubstitution|table of translations]]</nowiki>. Please help us by contributing to that table. As a quick guide, refer to our ''table of common translations'', below.

For the ''Check Spelling'' function on the wiki to function correctly, we should also add our words to the <nowiki>[[LocalSpellingWords|Local Spelling Words]]</nowiki> list.

=== Rosetta ===
Our primary tool is <nowiki>[[https://translations.launchpad.net/|Rosetta]]</nowiki>, Ubuntu's Web-based translation tool. To get started, consult the <nowiki>[[TranslatingUbuntu|Translation Team portal]]</nowiki> and the <nowiki>[[https://help.launchpad.net/LaunchpadTranslationsFAQ|FAQ list]]</nowiki>.

== Translation Guidelines ==

Unless they conflict with the information given below, translations should be based on the following dictionaries:

* TBD
=== Dialectical/Contextual Differences ===

Since our goal is to provide a common base for Nepali, one must be mindful of the use of Nepali internationally, and the differences between dialects and contexts (nouns/verbs, computing/non-computing, etc.). Below is a list of differences that should be reconciled. We will use the mailing list to discuss such matters.

=== Other Resources ===

== Similar Groups ==

Below is a list of groups that share some of our values. For our translation effort to be successful, we should be communicating and co-operating with them as much as possible.
