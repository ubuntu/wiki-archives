=== About... ===

Not much to say here. Spending my time with computerstuff since i can read a book. Started with SuSE (by the age of 6.4), discovered Debian and now using Ubuntu on my Laptop and Xebian on my XBox. I like the simple and clean design of ubuntu and that it's working out of the box without changing my config-files. Now spread it to the world... ;)
Ahh, at the moment i'm working with ltsp in the university. If you need help there, just ask..
Greets,
nille
