Kubuntu will release version 11.04, the Natty Narwhal, in April 2011. With this, the third alpha pre-release, we have introduced a few new things in in preparation for our next official version. Read below for some of the highlights. For more information of what is planned and being worked on, please read the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.kubuntu.org/Kubuntu/Todo|To Do document]]</nowiki>.

'''NOTE:''' This is an alpha pre-release. Pre-release versions of Kubuntu are NOT encouraged for anyone needing a stable system or for anyone who is not comfortable running into occasional, even frequent, breakage. Pre-release versions ARE recommended for Kubuntu developers and those who want to help in testing, reporting, and fixing bugs. Please do not use this in a production environment with data or workflows that you cannot do without.

== What's New In Alpha 3 ==

On top of the underlying changes in our Ubuntu core, there are a number of new and interesting things happening for this alpha.

The <nowiki>[[NattyNarwhal-TechnicalOverview|Natty Technical Overview]]</nowiki> shows the changes in the rest of Ubuntu.
                                                                                                                                                                                    
=== New Samba Filesharing ===

Thanks to the hard work of RodrigoBelem, we now have a working Samba filesharing system. You can now right-click on a folder in Dolphin, select "Properties" and easily share it with other computers on your network. It will even offer to install the Samba server if you do not already have it.

=== New Language Selector Module ===

We also now sport a new System Language Selector, now integrated into System Settings' Locale section. Now you can easily add, remove and manage languages wish extra security because it does not run as root.  Many thanks to <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~bambi|Romain Perier]]</nowiki> for working on this!

<nowiki>[[attachment:kubuntu-natty-gstreamer.png|<nowiki>[[File:kubuntu-natty-gstreamer-wee.png]]</nowiki></nowiki>]]

=== GTK Oxygen Theme ===

GTK applications such as Firefox or Inkscape now fit in with KDE's Plasma desktop.
