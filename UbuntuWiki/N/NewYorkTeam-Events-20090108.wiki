__TOC__

The Rochester group held an Asterisk demonstration and FAQ. There were sixteen attendees and many new faces this month. Hal14450 gave a solid presentation on the benefits of using open source as your VOIP (voice over IP) telephony solution. Hal14450 fielded many questions from the attendees and over came some technical difficulties by dialing in to his server using a cell phone while an attendee used Ekiga to connect to the server at the same time.
