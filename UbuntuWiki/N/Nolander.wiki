Hi!

Im blake 16 Australia. I've been using ubuntu since June 2006. i think it is the best linux distro i've used.

== About Me ==
=== Why I like Ubuntu ===
Its '''FREE'''. I like the fact that all the software is free and the range of software is wonderful. Its has every pice of software i need.

=== How i found ubuntu ===
In 2004 i install redhat on a mechine. It was like a foreign film without subtitles. i freaked and went back to window. And then mid 2006 my mate gave me an Ubuntu Live CD. At first i was unsure but after jumping on the ubuntu forums it began to grow on me. Now I love it.

=== Windows ===
Im Windows free.
