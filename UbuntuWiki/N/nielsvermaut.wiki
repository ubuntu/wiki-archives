=== Brief introduction ===
Hello, I'm a self-learned Web Developer. I like to digg around in Linux, just because tinkering is in my blood. I am currently trying to completely switch over from Windows to Ubuntu Gnome. 

=== Knowledge ===
My knowledge of programming/styling/it is listed here:
* I've learned VB.NET 2010 on school. I don't really use it, just if I want a very specific (small) application, I'll use VB.NET.
* I have followed introductory courses (on Teamtreehouse) on Ruby on Rails, Objective-C, and regular C. 
* I am planning on learning C++, just because I want to create applications on Linux. 
* Professionaly, I am able to write HTML/CSS, where I love to work with Bootstrap, and PHP, CakePHP to be more precise.

=== Contact ===
