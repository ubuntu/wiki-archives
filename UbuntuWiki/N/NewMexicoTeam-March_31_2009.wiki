<pre>
<tritium> Hello, dthomasdigital.
<dthomasdigital> Hello, just getting home...give me a few I'll be right back
<dthomasdigital> Good to see |mando| in the room
<tritium> Yep.  He's been around the past week or so.
<dthomasdigital> Man I got to stay connected to IRC
<dthomasdigital> Ok I'm back
* deinerson1 (n=chatzill@c-68-35-135-32.hsd1.nm.comcast.net) has joined #ubuntu-us-nm
<nick125> whee
<tritium> Hi deinerson1.
<deinerson1> hello all!
<tritium> We have a short agenda.  We can probably afford to wait a few more minutes.
<dthomasdigital> Not much on the agenda should there be more?
<dthomasdigital> ColonelPanik sent you 40 disk, stickers and cases badges. Went out in the mail Monday.
<jimrz> hi deinerson1
<deinerson1> hi jimrz :)
* beanie77 (n=pra@97-123-146-143.albq.qwest.net) has joined #ubuntu-us-nm
<beanie77> Good evening all
<protonchris> beanie77: Hey
<nick125> hello
<dthomasdigital> Hello all
<jimrz> hi beanie77 + dthomasdigital
<tritium> Well, we only have one agenda item: Webpage Update.  protonchris: do you want to give us the update?
<protonchris> Ok.
<protonchris> We now have hosting through canonical for your loco webpage.  Before we can use it, I need to install the loco theme and investigate launchpad integration.
<dthomasdigital> canonical hosting good job to those that got us that
<protonchris> That's it.
<tritium> Quickest meeting ever.
<nick125> haha
<dthomasdigital> lol How about LAN party? Release Party? LinuxFest?
<beanie77> I'm still having installation issues with ubuntu, if anyone can help. ubuntu now boots from the hd, though
<beanie77> We can discuss after the LAN party, Release part, linuxfest
<jimrz> we do have the Hospitality room @ Flying Star Corrales reserved for the Jaunty release party for Saturday May 2nd 6-9pm
<tritium> Thanks, jimrz.
<jimrz> no prob
<dthomasdigital> Hey folks Doomcat says hi!
<jimrz> hi Doomcat
<tritium> Hi to Doomcat, dthomasdigital.
<dthomasdigital> Cool Jimrz what is the cost?
<deinerson1> hey there doomcat!
<tritium> deinerson1: any update from EPC on the "incident"?
<jimrz> yet to be determined
<tritium> Since last Tuesday, she was back in here one more time.
<tritium> beanie77: what issues are you having?
<deinerson1> tritium: I did find out more - the girl is only 9. Gigi and I are going to speak (gently) with her about what a support chat room is. Ahh, since she is still coming back I will ramp up the talk with her
<tritium> deinerson1: sounds like a good plan.  Thanks for the update.
<beanie77> xorg doesn't see my monitor, EDID reports back nothing, as a result I get 800x600. I need to edit
<tritium> beanie77: old monitor?  CRT?  Do you know specs on it?
<beanie77> xorg.conf for force 1280x1024 or 1024x768.
<tritium> Have you successfully edited it?
<deinerson1> We will clearly ask her not to use the support chat rooms for the purpose of general chat. Gigi know her and her mother, so it will turn out all good
<beanie77> The monitor is an lcd and I lost the manual, can't find specs on the web either.
<tritium> deinerson1: good.  The most important part is to keep her safe.
<jimrz> dthomasdigital: cost will be $20/ hour + $3/person setup fee (min 10 people) w/ each person responsible for their own food purchases.
<tritium> beanie77: have you followed this guidance below?
<tritium> !fixres
<ubot3> The X Window System is the part of your system that's responsible for graphical output. To restart your X, type « sudo /etc/init.d/?dm restart » in a console - To fix screen resolution or other X problems: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Config/Resolution
<deinerson1> I am also going to remove the auto login into that channel, too.
<beanie77> The part that is disappointing is that suse uses sax to configure xconf when autodetect fails.
<dthomasdigital> We still planning the LAN party, Doomcat suggest smoking guns http://www.smokin-guns.net/index.php
<tritium> deinerson1: perfect.  I think the auto-login should only point here for now.
<beanie77> ubot3 this looks good, I'll try it out a little later.  Thanks
<ubot3> beanie77: Error: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)
<tritium> beanie77: ubuntu has fail-safe X now.  You're installing intrepid?
<dthomasdigital> tritium good idea for the most part people are in this room 24/7
<tritium> beanie77: he's a bot.  I had him send you that info.
<beanie77> Yes I'm installing 8.10
<deinerson1> dthomasdigital and doomcat: yes, I have read that is a great game
<tritium> dthomasdigital: true, but not necessarily 100% available (often idling)
<dthomasdigital> Yes please all come to the LAN party and see Doomcat dominate 
<tritium> beanie77: have you run "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"?
<beanie77> I did at one time, I can reload it.
<tritium> beanie77: knowing monitor specs would be helpful, too
<beanie77> I ran sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg. All it did was to change the kbd to 101 keys from 105.
<beanie77> I have another compter connected to the lcd and I tried copying the settings to xorg on ubuntu without success.
<beanie77> The other things I want to do is to boot to a shell instead of X. I haven't had any luck with that either.
<tritium> beanie77: if you pastebin your /etc/X11/xorg.conf and /var/log/Xorg.0.log, I can look at them for you.
<tritium> beanie77: to boot to the console, follow the first method (update-rc.d) here: http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/reference/ch-tips.en.html#s-no-x-start
<dthomasdigital> Jimrz you want me to update our jaunty page with the party info? Also I'll update the official party page.
<beanie77> right now xxorg.conf is empty, which I think is odd. It had a few lines before I reintalled.
<jimrz> dthomasdigital: yes, thank you
<tritium> beanie77: entirely empty?  Newer releases have very limited info in /etc/X11/xorg.conf, but not completely empty
<beanie77> I can send the log file later as I'm using another machine right now.
<tritium> OK, beanie77.  pastebin would be preferable.  Thanks.
<tritium> See that debian reference above for the second issue.
<beanie77> I know. Before I reinstalled xorg.conf hand a few lines.  What's pastebin?
<tritium> !pastebin
<ubot3> pastebin is a service to post multiple-lined texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu.com (make sure you give us the URL for your paste - see also the channel topic)
<tritium> dthomasdigital, protonchris, jimrz, deinerson1: what other business?
<protonchris> I don't have anything else.
<dthomasdigital> LinuxFest is moving along I'll have details coming soon
<deinerson1> I'm clear :)
<tritium> dthomasdigital: you might have seen you finally convinced me to sign up
<jimrz> none here either
<dthomasdigital> I saw, I was stunned
<jimrz> oh my
<tritium> dthomasdigital: :)
<beanie77> The Xorg.0.log says that it detects my matrox card ok, but can't use higher resolutions as it can't detect the monitor.
<jimrz> is that the 5th or 6th sign?
<dthomasdigital> Green Mountain Coffee will be supplying all our coffee needs for the fest....that's good news
<jimrz> :)
