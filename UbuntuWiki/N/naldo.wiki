May God bless everyone. first of all, I would like to tell you about my Ubuntu story.

I'd just got married in 2004, and we decided to buy a PC. Unfortunately, my first contact with computing was windows XP
and its programs, and at the end of that same year I couldn't put up with windows problems any more and I had my first contact with Linux, Debian. That first experience was unforgettable because I deleted everything in my PC, photos, musics, videos and nothing was left in, in that time I didn't know how to install any Linux OS. Today I'm not an expert in Linux yet, but I've learned how to install any Linux OS and I have almost more than 60 Linux operational systems. Debian, Fedora, Red hat, Mandriva, Suse, Slackware and their distros.

As I said before, I'm not an expert, but I know I can help this wonderful operational system, Ubuntu, in translating their files from English to Brazilian Portuguese as my compliment to it.
