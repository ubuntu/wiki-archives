__TOC__



Generally we will try to meet, as a team, at least twice a month in IRC to discuss what is going on in our individual Ubuntu efforts, plan what can be done as a team, and assist each other in building and implementing ideas to benefit the Ubuntu community.

This page will serve as a sort of hub for meeting information, and everybody is encouraged (yay Wiki!) to edit this and add ideas to the agenda, add responses to meeting times, and anything else that may  arise.

=== Schedule ===

* Team meetings will be held in #ubuntu-us-nc every '''1^st^ and 3^rd^ Thursday of every month'''.
