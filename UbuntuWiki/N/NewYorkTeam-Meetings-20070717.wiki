(06:14:44 PM) ausimage: great vbabiy... basically the bylaws define an organization...
(06:16:00 PM) ausimage: samiam010203: the two things under bylaws don't necessariily belong in the bylaws

(06:19:11 PM) vbabiy: 8pm maybe
(06:19:12 PM) ausimage: K... I am wondering who else is active enough and will to participate... I have already tackled them with some of the more active members.

(06:24:58 PM) samiam010203: now we move on to casual conversation
(06:25:29 PM) ausimage: what needs to be discussed?
(06:25:35 PM) samiam010203: nothing els
(06:25:38 PM) samiam010203: that was it
(06:25:41 PM) vbabiy: Well what else needs to be done to help move this group
(06:26:21 PM) samiam010203: well vbabiy, we would like people to help edit the wiki
(06:26:25 PM) ausimage: vbabiy: I think we need to find activities that will interest the members and help fulfill our goals
(06:27:01 PM) samiam010203: in a few im going to be installing gutsy kubuntu
(06:27:48 PM) ausimage: samiam010203: I think the goal is to find out what the memberships wants to do about bringing Ubuntu to New York
(06:28:02 PM) samiam010203: yes i aggry thats what it looks like
(06:28:16 PM) ausimage: How do they feel they can help make this a reality...
(06:28:58 PM) samiam010203: i think one thing we need to do is get everyone together at the 6 month meetup and start a sireus plan of action
(06:29:23 PM) ausimage: I don't have that answer for everyone... but for me working behind the scenes is where I want to be :)
(06:29:31 PM) samiam010203: thats cool
(06:29:59 PM) samiam010203: i like the idea of us getting more and more people into ubuntu threw outreach
(06:30:00 PM) ausimage: samiam010203: I wonder who all will travel if they do not even bother to participate in an IRC meeting
(06:30:11 PM) samiam010203: yes i think the3 same way
(06:30:24 PM) samiam010203: we could just kick them out opf the group :)
(06:30:44 PM) dbist: the best way is to find old machines install ubuntu and give to charity
(06:30:51 PM) ausimage: http://www.cypherbios.org/blog/?p=46&language=en read this samiam010203
(06:31:38 PM) ausimage: essential it quotes: The Matrix is a system, Neo. That system is our enemy. But when you’re inside, you look around. What do you see?
(06:31:38 PM) ausimage: Business people, teachers, lawyers, carpenters. The very minds of thepeople we are trying to save. But until we do, these people are still apart of that system, and that makes them our enemy.
(06:31:38 PM) ausimage: You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged. And many of them are so inert, so hopelessly dependant on the system, that they will fight to protect it.
(06:32:09 PM) ausimage: that is an analogy for Ubuntu and Linux in general 
(06:32:44 PM) samiam010203: i guess
(06:33:13 PM) dbist: where did i see that the other day
(06:33:49 PM) ausimage: I think it is about changing mindsets... and getting people to think outside of the box... getting them to see a new and better way....
(06:34:03 PM) dbist: i recruited a few guys :)
(06:34:15 PM) samiam010203: we need chicks :)
(06:34:19 PM) ausimage: dbist it was on Planet Ubuntu.... and the quote is from the Matrix
(06:35:19 PM) ausimage: cool dbist... I think the important thing is recruit more actors than audience...
(06:35:52 PM) dbist: oh early adopters are actors
(06:36:09 PM) ausimage: perhaps it is important to narrow the scope of what needs to be accomplished....
(06:36:27 PM) ausimage: edit wiki.... WOW that is a large....
(06:36:43 PM) dbist: i want to be at Ubuntu Live :(
(06:36:53 PM) ausimage: edit a page on how X affects you that is narrow
(06:37:09 PM) ausimage: yeah Ubuntu Live sounds like fun...
(06:37:23 PM) samiam010203: ill see you guys/ gals later
(06:37:37 PM) ausimage: dbist: maybe we should try to get Ubuntu Live! here
