== Feedback ==
* Super job! -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:claydoh]]</nowiki>  * Package kubuntu-desktop depends on kpat (Patience game). This makes no sense and keeps me from uninstalling the game without uninstalling kubuntu-desktop, too. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:dave-stfu]]</nowiki>  * Are those old-schooled apps like KMag and KMouseTool really used anymore and should they be installed by default? -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:dave-stfu]]</nowiki>
