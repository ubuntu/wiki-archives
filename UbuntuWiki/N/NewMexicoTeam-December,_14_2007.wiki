Face to face meeting at the Two Fools Tavern in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

Bad weather, and Christmas parties keep the attendance low, but that didn't stop the people that showed up from having good drink good food, and Ubuntu talk. 

If anyone was there and wants to add more or has pictures please contact me and I'll get them posted. dthomasdigital@gmail.com
