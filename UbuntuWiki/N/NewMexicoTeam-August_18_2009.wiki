<gcleric> thank you nick125!
<gcleric>   =)
<nick125> gcleric: Yee ask and yee shall receive!
<gcleric> the EPC lab upgrade to Jaunty went pretty smooth...apart from the new floor.
<protonchris> ubot3, locobot_4, and ChanServ don't count.
<ubot3> protonchris: Error: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)
<dthomasdigital> Oh we did not expect the new floor
<gcleric> !count
<ubot3> Factoid count not found
<nick125> gcleric: The new floor was pretty smooth, though :p
<gcleric> darn...
* genfool_ (n=genfool@70-57-254-29.albq.qwest.net) has joined #ubuntu-us-nm
<dthomasdigital> The wall looked nice too
<gcleric> nick125 yea,, I liked the little slippers..
<jimrz> thye lab is looking good now
<nick125> We still need to knock that SMC box off the wall
<gcleric> So EPC is now fully upgraded to Jaunty.  David E has not reported any issues post upgrade.
<dthomasdigital> pictures in the news section of the front page of the wiki https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NewMexicoTeam
<nick125> gcleric: Great.
<gcleric> I plan on stopping by this week to double check things..
<tritium> Awesome.
<ColonelPanik> gcleric,  put in for overtime.
<jimrz> and we even got tritium's Sony done without major issues
<gcleric> As mentioned earlier  Dr. Slishman is now switching to Linux.
<gcleric> He's ordered an EeePC.
<jimrz> :)
<dthomasdigital> tritium your sony did manage to give us a few issues ;)
<gcleric> Oh... we saved the sony for tritium...
<tritium> Why am I not surprised?
<gcleric> =)
<tritium> My favorite machine...
<nick125> I have a feeling that a nasty "accident" will happen to that Sony machine :P
<gcleric> It was mentioned that the Sony is the favorite machine for most users of the lab. =)
<gcleric> seriously,,,
<protonchris> Yeah, it has speakers in the monitor
<tritium> That's hilarious.
<jimrz> true
<gcleric> =)
<gcleric> oh... there is a minor DNS issue that David E is having but we thing it is in relation to Comcast switching IP's on the cable modem.
<protonchris> What is the issue?
<nick125> What's the issue?
<gcleric> we removed the SMC mini switch out of the mix,
<nick125> protonchris: Eek! Get away from my braaaain! :P
<gcleric> protonchris: nick125 they seem to have DNS resolution issues every so often.
<protonchris> Hmmm.  Comcast did make some dns changes recently.
<nick125> I thought EPC wasn't using Comcast's DNS.
<dthomasdigital> Oh how I hate the cable companies
<gcleric> nick125: they are not... but they have an OpenDNS account that is bound to an IP.
<protonchris> Ah.
<gcleric> they use this for filtering ...porn and such.
<nick125> gcleric: Well, if the IP changes...it should still resolve. It might not be associated to the account, but it should work.
<nick125> gcleric: Do they have a static IP?
<dthomasdigital> Oh nick125, DNS is evil oh so evil.
<nick125> dthomasdigital: Yes, I know.
<gcleric> nick125 I have asked David E to track ip changes and if the DNS issue crops up check to see what DNS the DHCP is offering...may be a device on the network.
<nick125> gcleric: What, you're thinking its some kind of rogue device on the network?
<gcleric> David E says it has not happened for a few weeks,
<dthomasdigital> On to the next item ?
<gcleric> nick125: yes...
<gcleric> sure..
<nick125> gcleric: Hmm...I wonder if that has anything to do with the DHCP issues we were having....likely not, but...mm
<gcleric> +1
<jay4rest> +1
<sylvainrb> +1
<kenneth_> +1 + $25.00
<gcleric> nick125 still something to track and collect more info.
<jimrz> +1
<nick125> Yeah, we've beat the EPC topic enough for tonight. +1
<dthomasdigital> She must have hidden the prawns in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them... I'm hungry!
<dthomasdigital> oh wrong topic
<dthomasdigital> Big thanks to ColonelPanik, gcleric, jimrz for helping make sure SFD can happen feel free to donate if you wish as we can find ways of making SFD really something this year.
<dthomasdigital> that's better
<gcleric> dthomasdigital: darth vader on twitter..
<dthomasdigital> gcleric I'm hooked on that guy
<kenneth_> I just donated $25.00 for the SFD
<gcleric> dthomasdigital: did you see my tweet back to him?  asking if he was refering to D9.
<dthomasdigital> So the guy in charge of events for cottonwood mall is well not very helpful
<dthomasdigital> kenneth_ thanks, I'm making displays for SFD and that will help big time 
<gcleric> dthomasdigital: uh oh...
<nick125> dthomasdigital: You need to go down there and whack them with the cluebat.
<dthomasdigital> we will still be doing it a cottonwood mall I just feel I've been doing his job
<nick125> dthomasdigital: Do you think we're going to get a response before the day of?
<jay4rest> you should get his pay
<jimrz> nick125: or a 2 iron
<gcleric> I know this guy named andre is a master with a knife and a god at hiding a body. =)
<dthomasdigital> I actually am going down tomarrow and getting all the paper work done
<protonchris> dthomasdigital: thanks
<dthomasdigital> But it really has been a chore, should be just very simple but damn he never returns a call, email nothing
<jay4rest> gcleric: lol
<gcleric> dthomasdigital: do we have enough $$$?
<gcleric> jay4rest: =)
<dthomasdigital> I'll have all the details by the end of the week, yes we are covered for SFD and the insurance. We still might have a few more expenses but not much
<nick125> dthomasdigital: What size of display/booth/whatnot are we going to have?
<dthomasdigital> I have a six foot table and will have standard tri-fold displays plus all kinds of disc.
<dthomasdigital> I have not got SFD confirmation on SFD stuff, but that's never stopped us before
<gcleric> dthomasdigital: I'm trying to see if I can grab one of our verizon wireless cards at work and pick up a Wireless-G Router for Verizon Wireless Broadband WRT54G3G Wireless Router
<dthomasdigital> as always gcleric rules
<nick125> I'd still like to see us have an LCD running some kind of demo video....Compiz, etc.
<dthomasdigital> I'll have my laptop, but SFD is really about just getting the disc in peoples hands, should have about 400 handouts as well
<beanie77> Do we know where in the mall and what hours?
<nick125> I think a good demo could help to get them to pick up that CD.
<dthomasdigital> Not yet beanie77 I'll know more tomorrow and will get it out on the mailing list ASAP
<jay4rest> Maybe download some youtube video demos
<jay4rest> linux foundation  has some too
<dthomasdigital> On SFD we hand out Windows Open Source as well, for those that have never taken part in a SFD, it helps with the conversion process.
<dthomasdigital> That sounded kind of evil......
<nick125> haha
<doomcat> yeah but we have no choice
<nick125> WE MUST CONTINUE WITH THE MASTER PLAN!
<jay4rest> it is a contradiction
<gcleric> or and oxymoron
<jay4rest> it helps in transitioning them to Linux
<jimrz> do we have enough copies of the open cd and open education?
<dthomasdigital> Ready for next item?
<jay4rest> +1
<doomcat> +1
<sylvainrb> +1
<jimrz> +1
<gcleric> +1
<nick125> +1
<dthomasdigital> As you can see the menu and table of contents have changed, thanks to the Florida LoCo, I basically stole all their code.
<nick125> Looking good.
<jay4rest> always best not to reinvent the wheel
<jimrz> love that open approach
<dthomasdigital> Just of changes are made in the future make sure you check with the person who last edited and coordinate those changes with that person.
<nick125> I like putting the meeting bar below the menu.
<gcleric> ditto.
<dthomasdigital> Like I said those Florida guys can code some MoinMoin
<tritium> Looks good, dthomasdigital.
<gcleric> dthomasdigital: and make a mean mojito
