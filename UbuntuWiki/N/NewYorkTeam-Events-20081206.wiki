__TOC__

The first NY State LoCo Rockland County Region Meetup was a success.  We had 2 LoCo members and 3 non-members attend.  This was an open forum, with no agenda.  

Discussions that took place were as follows:
* Working with the local PCUG to conduct Ubuntu/Linux/FOSS workshops.
* Again, working with the local PCUG regarding getting involved with their PC recycling program. Hopefully, we can use this as an opportunity to use those PC's for installfests or for demonstrations.
* Gaming in Ubuntu, especially the non-proprietary games available. 
* General Ubuntu/Linux experiences.

'''==ORIGINAL EVENT NOTICE=='''

NewJack has planned a Rockland County Meetup for Saturday December 6, 2008 @
1pm at the Potato Republic which is located in New City (see map below).
Anyone who can make the ride is invited.  I figure this is a meetup to
get to know each other and to discuss future meetup locations and
ideas.
