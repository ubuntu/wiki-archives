The event drew approximately 25 people from all over central NY including members of the Syracuse Linux User Group (SyrLUG). The presentations had some technical difficulties but they went on none the less and were well received from all who attended. The area set aside from install was quite cramped do to the overwhelming response but we opened up more rooms and everyone found a spot. Overall we got a real positive response and plan on having more event in the future.
