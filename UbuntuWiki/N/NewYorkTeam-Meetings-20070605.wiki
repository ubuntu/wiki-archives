== Request for speaker ==
  (From the email:  My name is Matthew Hirsch and I am writing you as a board member of UnigroupNY <nowiki>[[http://unigroup.org/|(Unix User Group Of New York.)]]</nowiki> Unigroup is a user group that is vendor and platform neutral that has been serving the New York area since the early 1980's.  As Ubuntu is being used more, we feel that it would be useful for our members to have a meeting about the Ubuntu distribution.

  Would you be able to arrange or know who to contact to arrange a technical presentation about the distribution?

  The people that we have at our meetings are typically mid level to senior technical professionals and they would need to know how is Ubuntu different than other linux distributions. If the presenter was also able to give a technical talk about one of the aspects of Ubuntu, it would be great.

  We have meetings in downtown New York city.  Actually, our meeting location is 2 blocks south of where the the World Trade Center was.   We meet the third Thursday of the month. (so this would be for: 20070621, 20070719, 20070816, or 20070920.)

  Thank you.

(06:15:22 PM) Zyrshnikashnu [n=zyrshnik@pool-72-75-214-193.bflony.east.verizon.net] entered the room.
(06:15:26 PM) samiam010203: did you see the flier yet ?

(06:15:45 PM) samiam010203: hello and welcome zyr
(06:15:50 PM) n8k99: that way if they say yes, we know that we are not completely wasting our time
(06:15:57 PM) samiam010203: ok
(06:16:16 PM) samiam010203: so i think we should stay in the park and not go into the souronding streets

(06:17:42 PM) samiam010203: u would be suprised , we might just run into a lot of *nix users down there
(06:17:45 PM) n8k99: no pressure for anybody
(06:17:48 PM) samiam010203: true
(06:18:27 PM) n8k99: the real objective- at least in my mind- is to find some other ubuntu users who are not aware of the community aspects
(06:18:31 PM) samiam010203: so also we should hand them the flier and the cd at the same time
(06:18:32 PM) n8k99: such as this team
(06:18:45 PM) samiam010203: yes thats what i was thinking too n8
(06:18:55 PM) samiam010203: so that way we can grow the group
(06:19:05 PM) n8k99: exactly
(06:19:23 PM) samiam010203: its going to be sunny and 74 tomorrow so a lot of people will be around
(06:19:59 PM) samiam010203: and we will, im sure, run into other linux users down there
(06:20:08 PM) samiam010203: and we will try and get them into the group as well
(06:20:30 PM) n8k99: but without being spooky and weird
(06:20:39 PM) samiam010203: yes exactly
(06:20:47 PM) hendrixski [n=hendrixs@cpe-66-66-116-69.rochester.res.rr.com] entered the room.
(06:20:50 PM) samiam010203: like you cant walk up to people and act like a nut

(06:22:43 PM) hendrixski: samiam010203, but the others at the meeting may not have caught it
(06:22:56 PM) samiam010203: yes i know
(06:23:33 PM) hendrixski: but acting like a nut, is probably not a good way to hand them out
(06:23:36 PM) n8k99: who called me a nut!!!

(06:24:23 PM) hendrixski: jk
(06:24:40 PM) samiam010203: but i think we should defer it to another time becasuse there is not alot of people here now to dicuse it
(06:24:54 PM) hendrixski: samiam010203, what does he want one of us to talk about?
(06:24:58 PM) ***hendrixski loves to talk about stuff
(06:25:03 PM) samiam010203: ubuntu and its usses
(06:25:20 PM) hendrixski: This is a NYC guy? or an upstate guy?
(06:25:23 PM) samiam010203: The people that we have at our meetings are typically mid level to senior technical professionals and they would need to know how is Ubuntu different than other linux distributions. If the presenter was also able to give a technical talk about one of the aspects of Ubuntu, it would be great.
(06:25:43 PM) samiam010203: We have meetings in downtown New York city. Actually, our meeting location is 2 blocks south of where the the World Trade Center was. We meet the third Thursday of the month. (so this would be for: 20070621, 20070719, 20070816, or 20070920.)

(06:26:38 PM) n8k99: who needs a speaker?
