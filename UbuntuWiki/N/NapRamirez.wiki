=== About Me ===

I've been using Linux since 2003, and Ubuntu since 2005.  Ever since getting a hold of the shipments from Canonical, I never stopped spreading Linux awareness using Ubuntu as the selling point to new users.  I converted an entire company of a little over 50 people to use Ubuntu, and I continue to spread the F/L Open Source love to even greater distances.
