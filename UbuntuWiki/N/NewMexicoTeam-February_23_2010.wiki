20:11 < tritium> Looks like we have a few agenda items: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NewMexicoTeam/February_23_2010
20:11 < protonchris> Cool.
20:11 < protonchris> I can handle item #1.
20:12 < kenneth__> also there is a help request on the the forum http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1411015
20:12 < protonchris> http://nm.ubuntu-us.org/
20:13 < protonchris> That is the website.  We haven't really done anything with it since it was setup.  It probably needs a software update if we are going to use it.
20:13 < tritium> protonchris: It's not letting me login with my launchpad open id.
20:14 < protonchris> Looks like it must of broke along the way.  I am willing to fix it if we plan to use it.
20:16 < tritium> protonchris: can you log in?
20:16 < protonchris> tritium: not right now.
20:17 < deinerson1> The site looks very nice - professional!
20:18 [Users #ubuntu-us-nm]
20:18 [@ChanServ  ] [ locobot_4  ] [ smooge ] [ |mando|] 
20:18 [ deinerson1] [ mneptok    ] [ tritium] 
20:18 [ fgleich   ] [ nick125    ] [ ubot3  ] 
20:18 [ kenneth__ ] [ protonchris] [ woowoo ] 
20:18 -!- Irssi: #ubuntu-us-nm: Total of 13 nicks [1 ops, 0 halfops, 0 voices, 12 normal]
20:19 < tritium> I'm sure there are many good uses for the website.
20:19 < protonchris> I used a ubuntu theme.
20:19 < protonchris> tritium: sure.  I agree, but no one (including myself) has been interested.
20:21 < protonchris> So if someone is interested in adding content, I am willing to get it working again.
20:23 < fgleich> any specific type ?
20:23 < nick125> I think it might not be a bad idea, but it is a bit of a hassle to deal with.
20:24 < kenneth__> something to welcome new users
20:24 < tritium> We could start with some static information that won't change much, like the LoCo's contact info.  I know we have this info on the wiki page, but it can't hurt to put it on the website as well.
20:25 < fgleich> good thought
20:25 < tritium> I know we're all busy, and have limited time for updating wiki and web pages.
20:25 < protonchris> Sounds good to me.  I can work on getting the openid working again this weekend.  It looks like local logins work, but openid is borked.
20:26 < tritium> Thanks, protonchris.  If it's not too much trouble.
20:26 < fgleich> it wouldn't let me register
20:26 < tritium> fgleich: have you signed up on launchpad?
20:26 < protonchris> Yeah, I am not sure what is wrong.
20:26 < fgleich> uh.......no
20:26 -!- genfool [~genfool@70-57-255-4.albq.qwest.net] has joined #ubuntu-us-nm
20:27 < tritium> Do you have an OpenID?
20:27 < fgleich> also no
20:28 < deinerson1> I am getting this msg in chrome64: Unable to find the socket transport "ssl" - did you forget to enable it when you configured PHP?
20:28 < tritium> I might suggest you register on launchpad, then, fgleich.
20:28 < deinerson1> I do have openID via launchpad
20:28 < fgleich> ok, where is launchpad ?
20:28 < tritium> !launchpad
20:28 < ubot3> Launchpad is a collection of development services for Open Source projects. It's Ubuntu's bug tracker, and much more; see https://launchpad.net/
20:29 < fgleich> thanks !
20:30 < tritium> No problem.
20:31 < genfool> Hi gang, sorry I am late....did I miss much?
20:32 < tritium> Hi, genfool.  No, we're just discussing the LoCo website.
20:32 < protonchris> deinerson1: Are you getting that on the loco page?
20:33 < deinerson1> prontochris: yes - on the drupal http://nm.ubuntu-us.org/ site
20:33 < deinerson1> when I select login
20:33 < deinerson1> it looks like a PHP msg - at the tippy top of the page
20:34 < protonchris> Hmm.  I had trouble with that in the past and it was a pain.
20:37 < protonchris> It took a lot of convincing to get the hosting guys to enable ssl in php.  I wonder if they changed their mind and switched back in the 8 months it has been since we used the site.
20:37 < tritium> I was wondering the same thing.
20:40 < protonchris> Dangit
20:40 < fgleich> dagnabit !
20:41 < tritium> Did you confirm that to be the case, protonchris?
20:45 < tritium> We have about 15 minutes left.  Shall we address the second agenda item, and the forum post that kenneth__ pointed out?
20:46 < deinerson1> Here's the event info for the 1st Annual Endorphin Day at EPC this Saturday - everyone is invited: http://endorphinpower.ning.com/events/1st-annual-endorphins-day
20:46 < fgleich> yes we should
20:47 < deinerson1> There is an online and downloadable PDF that has all the details available on that link.
20:47 < protonchris> tritium: No I will need to dig more.  I don't want to involve the hosting guys until I have too.  Since we get the hosting for free, I try to only bug the admins when absolutely necessary.
20:47 < tritium> Looks like a great event, deinerson1.  I'm sorry that I won't be able to attend.
20:47 < deinerson1> The highlight will be Sam speaking about his 3 weeks in Haiti
20:47 < tritium> protonchris: good strategy
20:48 < deinerson1> tritium: ahh well, there's always next year :)
20:49 < deinerson1> EPC has a new Executive Director: Janice Mancuso janice.mancuso@gmail.com
20:49 < deinerson1> The big 2010 plans include lots of outings, too.
20:50 < tritium> Sounds great.  Will there be another endorphathon?
20:50 < deinerson1> tritium: not this year - we had no one willing to take it on
20:52 < deinerson1> Other EPC news (and the last bit): we are close to setting up EPC with a standard Google Apps account, so we'll all be getting proper endorphinpower.org email addresses.
20:53 < tritium> Awesome.
20:54 < protonchris> I need to get going.  I will let you guys know when I have the website up and running.  It might take me a little while.
20:54 < fgleich> great work deinerson1
20:54 < deinerson1> Here's next weeks agenda link: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NewMexicoTeam/March_2_2010
20:55 < fgleich> thanks protonchris , ttyl
20:55 < deinerson1> good night prontochris
20:55 < fgleich> and nice design work on the website tritium and protonchris
20:56 < protonchris> fgleich: I can't take any credit for that.  The theme is a project on launchpad.
20:57 < fgleich> well, great theme choice :)
20:57 < tritium> I can't take any credit.
20:57 < tritium> Well, it's nearly 9:00, and I need to get going.
20:57 < tritium> Have a good night, everyone.  Talk to you soon.
20:58 < fgleich> g'night tritium ttyl
20:58 < deinerson1> good night tritium
20:58 < fgleich> oh I got some info on bumper stickers
20:59 < fgleich> we can talk another time about it
21:00 < kenneth__> Iam look for other venue to go to.
