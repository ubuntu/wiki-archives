(10:23:43 PM) hal14450: NYSCATE - Canonical has not offered support; do we want to try and raise $750 or give up on the idea of an Ubuntu booth?  <----- I'm going to that come hell or high water and franky i don't care what brand of FOSS i'm peddling so long as I can peddle it
(10:24:13 PM) ausimage_oui: k
(10:24:18 PM) cprofitt: hal14450, I agree... but as the 'LoCo' I want to know if we give up on the idea of an Ubuntu booth
(10:24:28 PM) cprofitt: the question of a Fedora booth is a different question
(10:24:34 PM) TheDukeNY: any details about our next meeting?
(10:24:40 PM) hal14450: well i can't really afford to shell out that kind of cash
(10:24:43 PM) TheDukeNY: nothing is on the wiki
(10:24:53 PM) cprofitt: tonight TheDukeNY
(10:24:55 PM) cprofitt: right now
(10:25:04 PM) cprofitt: we started a bit late
(10:25:07 PM) ausimage_oui: lets get through this agenda
(10:25:16 PM) cprofitt: ausimage, you want to cover the first items though
(10:25:26 PM) ausimage_oui: yeah

(10:25:42 PM) TheDukeNY: good thing Im herethen :)
(10:25:48 PM) ausimage_oui: first thing https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NewYorkTeam/Events is our old business

(10:26:14 PM) ausimage_oui: but just want it pointed out :)
(10:26:23 PM) cprofitt: I do have one thing there
(10:26:33 PM) ausimage_oui: k
(10:26:42 PM) ausimage_oui: cprofitt: ?
(10:26:47 PM) hal14450: huge turnout for whitehat
(10:26:48 PM) cprofitt: I sent out 103 emails tonight to the people that signed up that they were interested in getting more information about the LoCo
(10:27:11 PM) ausimage_oui: oh nice cprofitt
(10:27:22 PM) ausimage_oui: new blood mmmmmmm ;)
(10:27:38 PM) ausimage_oui: anything else?
(10:27:47 PM) cprofitt: The organizer was so impressed with our booth activity and the number of people at Carl's presentation that he announced at the end of the meeting that he wants to do a Linux focused event this September
(10:27:51 PM) hal14450: this is what happens when we attend events that aren't really linux centric
(10:27:51 PM) ***cprofitt done
(10:27:57 PM) cprofitt: takes a while to type ausimage
(10:28:04 PM) cprofitt: and when in the middle I can not answer you questions
(10:28:06 PM) ausimage_oui: sorry
(10:28:12 PM) cprofitt: your
(10:28:20 PM) cprofitt: damn spelling stinks tonight
(10:28:39 PM) hal14450: carl was standing room only
(10:29:03 PM) ausimage_oui: awesome
(10:29:16 PM) hal14450: they borrowed chairs from another room
(10:30:44 PM) ausimage_oui: k.. then ready for some fall release party discusion?
(10:31:21 PM) cprofitt: yes
(10:31:26 PM) hal14450: you set a date for that?
(10:31:41 PM) Slick666: should we go for the first sat?
(10:31:50 PM) ausimage_oui: most likely 1st nov weekend
(10:31:54 PM) Slick666: capture teh excitement
(10:31:55 PM) cprofitt: of which month November?
(10:32:03 PM) ausimage_oui: yes
(10:32:18 PM) ausimage_oui: release weekend is halloween
(10:32:20 PM) cprofitt: November 7th then
(10:32:25 PM) ausimage_oui: yeah
(10:32:54 PM) ausimage_oui: I need to get details from the wife about the HI...
(10:33:04 PM) LordKenTheGreat left the room (quit: ).
(10:33:12 PM) cprofitt: So two weeks after Ontario Linux Fest and three weeks prior to NYSCATE
(10:33:22 PM) hal14450: busy season
(10:33:30 PM) ausimage_oui: and I should also ask scotty from HWS
(10:33:34 PM) ausimage_oui: yeah
(10:33:50 PM) cprofitt: It may work better to see if HWS can host...
(10:34:05 PM) hal14450: there's an idea
(10:34:07 PM) ausimage_oui: yeah I was thinking abouut thAT
(10:34:31 PM) cprofitt: Though to be honest I would rather have them host a larger spring event than a fall event
(10:34:33 PM) ausimage_oui: QUESTION HOW INVOLVED DO WE WANT
(10:34:42 PM) cprofitt: due to the 'packed' nature of the fall
(10:34:45 PM) ausimage_oui: sorry 
(10:35:03 PM) hal14450: so long as we have a location where i don't have to play presentation lackey i'll be happy lol
(10:35:10 PM) ***ausimage_oui typing on tiny mini keyboard
(10:35:41 PM) cprofitt: I really think we need to have one release be 'local' for communities and outreach by our members to their LUGs and one season for a combined central event
(10:35:46 PM) ausimage_oui: do we want to a tracked session?
(10:36:09 PM) ausimage_oui: sessions
(10:36:17 PM) ausimage_oui: and trades
(10:36:38 PM) cprofitt: for the big event a track or multiple tracks would be good... once it grows in size
(10:37:00 PM) ausimage_oui: so like this spring then or a little more?
(10:37:07 PM) ausimage_oui: how much more?
(10:37:10 PM) hal14450: i dunno if we're ready for that step i'd be happy to see a decent turnout like the last one and build on it
(10:37:30 PM) Slick666: I agree
(10:37:32 PM) cprofitt: I think this spring we can have another central event...
(10:37:37 PM) Slick666: we should take it one step at a time
(10:37:37 PM) ausimage_oui: so a single track?
(10:37:41 PM) cprofitt: with perhaps once 'classroom'
(10:37:45 PM) cprofitt: and one demo room
(10:37:46 PM) hal14450: get a few of these events under our belt
(10:37:46 PM) ausimage_oui: and a lab then
(10:37:52 PM) cprofitt: I do not think we are ready for multiple tacks
(10:37:58 PM) ausimage_oui: k
(10:38:00 PM) cprofitt: unless we work with Larry
(10:38:10 PM) ausimage_oui: that does make it simpler
(10:38:11 PM) cprofitt: which would put the event in Rochester and out of our control...
(10:38:17 PM) cprofitt: which I would prefer not to do
(10:38:27 PM) ausimage_oui: yeah true
(10:38:40 PM) cprofitt: I do not mind working with Larry on an event... but think we need to build our own as well...
(10:38:47 PM) cprofitt: though perhaps the efforts will merge
(10:38:49 PM) Slick666: I think we should look at seperating demo and class room
(10:39:06 PM) hal14450: i'd like to attend this --->  http://fsoss.senecac.on.ca/2009/
(10:39:22 PM) ausimage_oui: I will try to ping scotty and get an estimate for the HI for the bigger room
(10:39:35 PM) hal14450: pick their brains and get them to show up for a similar event in NY
(10:39:36 PM) cprofitt: There is also the chance that we will have a FOSS event in Rochester
(10:39:40 PM) cprofitt: pleia2, are you here?
(10:39:47 PM) pleia2: mhmm
(10:40:07 PM) ausimage_oui: pleia2 needs to come
(10:40:08 PM) cprofitt: pleia2, what is the channel and web page for the NE FOSS CON
(10:40:19 PM) hal14450: #northeastgnulinuxfest
(10:40:27 PM) cprofitt: hal14450, that is the middle of the week following Ontario Linux Fest
(10:40:27 PM) pleia2: that's the one :)
(10:40:30 PM) pleia2: far too long
(10:40:56 PM) hal14450: pleia2, <tab>
(10:41:21 PM) hal14450: cprofitt, it is but it's also very interesting
(10:41:27 PM) cprofitt: it is...
(10:41:33 PM) cprofitt: but I can not afford to do both...
(10:41:48 PM) cprofitt: I would like to do both... but can not afford to do both
(10:41:59 PM) hal14450: yeah i'm pretty sure i can't unless jaguar has his brother put me up lol
(10:42:04 PM) cprofitt: I would also like to have a version of that in NY State as well
(10:42:24 PM) Slick666: I think we're getting off topic guys
(10:42:32 PM) cprofitt: we are...
(10:42:45 PM) Slick666: back on topic ......
(10:42:45 PM) cprofitt: I think the Fall launch should be local not central
(10:42:49 PM) cprofitt: to get back on topic
(10:42:55 PM) Slick666: are we at a concensus about the location of the fall release party?
(10:42:56 PM) hal14450: we've got all sorts of FOSS goodness going on here a lot of it's happening @ RIT
(10:42:57 PM) ausimage_oui: so a simple fall session simliar to this spring
(10:43:03 PM) cprofitt: shoot for a central event at HWS for the spring
(10:43:15 PM) cprofitt: Slick666, no...
(10:43:23 PM) cprofitt: I do not think we have a consensus
(10:43:42 PM) ausimage_oui: that is what I hear
(10:43:45 PM) cprofitt: Though no one has + or - anything
(10:44:04 PM) cprofitt: I would vote for spring = central and fall = local LUG based
(10:44:06 PM) Slick666: should we get some nominations?
(10:44:20 PM) cprofitt: it allows us to bring together people once a year and to support our LUGs once a year
(10:44:34 PM) cprofitt: that is my idea...
(10:44:35 PM) hal14450: ausimage_oui, you've got a community to build on in HWS so why not take advantage of that this rls ?
(10:44:36 PM) cprofitt: any others?
(10:44:59 PM) ausimage_oui: mulitiple parties this fall?
(10:45:07 PM) cprofitt: yes, multiple parties...
(10:45:15 PM) ausimage_oui: big one may 2010?
(10:45:16 PM) cprofitt: our members supporting a launch with their local LUG
(10:45:26 PM) cprofitt: big one in May 2010 - yes
(10:45:35 PM) cprofitt: or central medium sized one
(10:45:37 PM) ausimage_oui: in favor?
(10:45:41 PM) cprofitt: +1
(10:45:49 PM) Slick666: Abstain
(10:46:02 PM) cprofitt: Abstain = 0
(10:46:07 PM) Slick666: lol
(10:46:09 PM) cprofitt: easier to type
(10:46:14 PM) cprofitt: no = -1
(10:46:23 PM) ausimage_oui: hal?
(10:46:37 PM) cprofitt: or so the convention is in the IRC world I have floated about
(10:46:52 PM) hal14450: +1
(10:46:57 PM) ausimage_oui: k
(10:47:07 PM) hal14450: sorry i had to take a bathroom break
(10:47:27 PM) cprofitt: ausimage, ?
(10:47:29 PM) cprofitt: your vote
(10:47:33 PM) ausimage_oui: so it will be multi party this fall and regional this spring
(10:47:44 PM) TheDukeNY: mk
(10:47:59 PM) cprofitt: though I hope NY City can get its act together this fall
(10:48:07 PM) cprofitt: they were a train wreck this spring
(10:48:24 PM) TheDukeNY: there's nobody out here
(10:48:26 PM) TheDukeNY: :(
(10:48:28 PM) ausimage_oui: yeah it is quite a bummer to get bogged down in the details there
(10:48:31 PM) cprofitt: arguing about bagel shop vs. library vs. I dunno what
(10:48:41 PM) hal14450: well their are so many people down there it's hard for them to get organized it seems
(10:48:46 PM) TheDukeNY: oh, that
(10:48:47 PM) TheDukeNY: heh
(10:48:52 PM) hal14450: there*
(10:49:06 PM) cprofitt: Dude if I was there I would just say -- I am going to be here - JOIN ME
(10:49:08 PM) hal14450: do-ocracy
(10:49:09 PM) cprofitt: and that would end it
(10:49:32 PM) TheDukeNY: Well, if you would like to help with finding an afforable place for everyone, your more then welcome to help me
(10:49:32 PM) cprofitt: all the trashing about was pointless
(10:49:42 PM) TheDukeNY: since there is really nobody else doing this stuff here
(10:49:43 PM) cprofitt: If I lived there I would...
(10:49:55 PM) ausimage_oui: ready for next item?
(10:49:56 PM) hal14450: TheDukeNY, i would as well
(10:50:09 PM) TheDukeNY: I was kinda doing everything myself, and I didn't have much notice. Like 4 days to organize something
(10:50:18 PM) hal14450: hell i'd make it a free place to meet
(10:50:23 PM) TheDukeNY: there was no chance it was going to happen, but at least I tried
(10:50:36 PM) ausimage_oui: yeah true TheDukeNY
(10:50:38 PM) cprofitt: TheDukeNY, there was a discussion on the mailing list that went on for three weeks I think
(10:50:44 PM) TheDukeNY: They would have meet, we had enough people interestd
(10:51:03 PM) cprofitt: we have time this fall...
(10:51:08 PM) cprofitt: so we should be able to get it done
(10:51:17 PM) hal14450: TheDukeNY, http://www.communitywiki.org/en/DoOcracy
(10:51:19 PM) TheDukeNY: So were is this free place you speak of, i would like to hear it
(10:51:24 PM) cprofitt: next topic ausimage ?
(10:51:34 PM) ausimage_oui: righty then...
(10:51:39 PM) cprofitt: TheDukeNY, I use Barnes and Noble
(10:51:41 PM) ausimage_oui: Nyscate....
(10:51:45 PM) cprofitt: but we can talk after the meeting
(10:51:47 PM) cprofitt: NYSCATE
(10:51:53 PM) TheDukeNY: Barnes and Nobles is not free in NYC
(10:51:58 PM) cprofitt: I have spoken to SABDFL and jcastro
(10:52:09 PM) cprofitt: and not heard anything about if they will or will not
(10:52:16 PM) cprofitt: support a booth at NYSCATE
(10:52:39 PM) cprofitt: I would like to have the LoCo weigh in on if I should continue to try or if we should wait until 2010
(10:52:42 PM) cprofitt: and try again
(10:52:59 PM) ausimage_oui: is there a deadline?
(10:53:05 PM) hal14450: i'm all for attending
(10:53:24 PM) hal14450: i don't care if i have to peddle FOSS in the parking lot
(10:53:27 PM) cprofitt: ausimage, I believe there is a deadline
(10:53:35 PM) ausimage_oui: when?
(10:53:45 PM) cprofitt: I am still submitting two RFP (presentation proposals)
(10:53:58 PM) cprofitt: but getting the booth is a different matter
(10:54:47 PM) ausimage_oui: perhaps it shoulkd be publically blogged about?
(10:54:47 PM) cprofitt: http://www.nyscate.org/conferences.cfm?subpage=363
(10:54:48 PM) hal14450: would be nice if i could get some shipit discs instead of having to make a bunch for the event
(10:55:09 PM) cprofitt: ausimage, I have blogged about it... asked during SABDFLs session in OpenWeek
(10:55:29 PM) ausimage_oui: k
(10:56:00 PM) cprofitt: http://www.nyscate.org/conference_rfp.cfm?confid=27
(10:56:13 PM) cprofitt: I have filled one of those out and will be completing another later this week
(10:56:16 PM) hal14450: cprofitt, you think we can manage dispensing another ~300 or discs without running out before lunch hits?
(10:56:37 PM) cprofitt: I, Hal and Karlie are working with Sugar labs and Fedora on submitting some proposals as well
(10:56:50 PM) cprofitt: hal14450, I would say double what we did in Ithaca
(10:56:53 PM) cprofitt: 600+
(10:56:56 PM) ausimage_oui: I feel we should be out everywhere possible
(10:57:13 PM) hal14450: cprofitt, that's gonna come out of my pocket lol
(10:57:15 PM) Slick666: Amen
(10:57:22 PM) cprofitt: and that can not come out of hal14450 and cprofitt pockets only
(10:57:32 PM) ausimage_oui: not sure how to get around the monetary issue
(10:57:46 PM) cprofitt: I have already put $50 towards the presentation board
(10:57:55 PM) cprofitt: and I know you have spent $$$ on CDs for all the events
(10:58:16 PM) cprofitt: the support thus far from Canonical / Ubuntu community has been lack luster
(10:58:18 PM) hal14450: i do my part
(10:58:39 PM) cprofitt: a few shirts, soem pens, two hats, some fliers, and some stickers
(10:59:06 PM) ausimage_oui: cprofitt: there seems to be the pervasive attitude that it should come from a members pocket rather than raised
(10:59:12 PM) cprofitt: ausimage_oui, it goes back to us becoming a 503c
(10:59:16 PM) cprofitt: or operating under one
(10:59:25 PM) hal14450: i can't expect a boatload of cash for events but something like this i'd like to see an offer of "dollar for dollar match" or something
(10:59:30 PM) ***Slick666 has one we could use
(10:59:32 PM) ausimage_oui: yeah and that seems frowned on too
(10:59:48 PM) Slick666: yea
(10:59:58 PM) cprofitt: ausimage_oui, I would think Canonical and Ubuntu would look at larger events...
(11:00:07 PM) cprofitt: and want to potentially support some of them
(11:00:09 PM) ausimage_oui: i like the matching funds way to-
(11:00:10 PM) Slick666: has anyone perused the organization for funding?
(11:00:20 PM) hal14450: this isn't a linux centric event
(11:00:27 PM) cprofitt: at the very least it would be nice to have an answer and not a we'll look in to that with no response
(11:00:31 PM) hal14450: so it's ideal to invest in
(11:00:38 PM) cprofitt: Slick666, which organization?
(11:01:19 PM) Slick666: the DEC users group have 503C
(11:01:28 PM) ausimage_oui: it is computer centric with millions of computers on the line ;)
(11:01:30 PM) hal14450: when i was groing up the first computer in my school was an apple II since they actually bothered to stick their noses in
(11:01:36 PM) Slick666: we could operate the ubuntu friends groups as a branch of that group
(11:01:45 PM) Slick666: alot easier than creating our own
(11:01:49 PM) cprofitt: Slick666, we could...
(11:01:55 PM) cprofitt: Rochester also has RCSI
(11:02:25 PM) cprofitt: but not sure how money gets taken in and spent if you are a sub-group
(11:02:30 PM) hal14450: hell rcsi loved us presenting last week
(11:02:52 PM) ausimage_oui: partnering wouild be easiest as it probably end a grand or more for us to incorporate
(11:03:00 PM) cprofitt: they wanted me to present, but the news letter went out already
(11:03:23 PM) hal14450: i'd be willing to bet they'd love the attention gleaned from nyscate and we can hit up a local vendor for a raffle maybe boost the roles in the process
(11:03:25 PM) ausimage_oui: we are diverting again :S thouhg
(11:03:28 PM) cprofitt: yes, but if some group gets $3000 in are they going to give it all to us... or how would that work
(11:03:39 PM) cprofitt: hal14450, they might...
(11:03:41 PM) cprofitt: we can ask...
(11:03:51 PM) cprofitt: the other option is to get a corporate sponsor
(11:04:00 PM) cprofitt: like Brite or System76
(11:04:04 PM) cprofitt: Brite will be there
(11:04:05 PM) ausimage_oui: ibm or google?
(11:04:10 PM) cprofitt: but not sure if they want to sponsor us
(11:04:13 PM) cprofitt: Google might...
(11:04:19 PM) cprofitt: IBM would not IMHO
(11:04:39 PM) hal14450: i'll pimp for a foss vendor booth
(11:04:55 PM) ausimage_oui: get carley ;)
(11:05:24 PM) cprofitt: We are still working with Sugar labs and Fedora
(11:05:30 PM) ausimage_oui: cool
(11:05:34 PM) cprofitt: there may be a FOSS booth there, but it looks like it will not be Ubuntu
(11:05:47 PM) ausimage_oui: that wouldbe sad
(11:06:00 PM) ausimage_oui: ley move on?
(11:06:04 PM) ausimage_oui: lets
(11:06:11 PM) cprofitt: yes
(11:06:11 PM) cprofitt: lets
(11:06:31 PM) cprofitt: who is planning on going to Ontario Linux festival?
(11:06:35 PM) Slick666: here
(11:06:36 PM) ausimage_oui: OnLinux who plans to attend
(11:06:43 PM) cprofitt: I really would like to get a list so we know...
(11:06:44 PM) Slick666: (work sponsors me :))
(11:06:52 PM) Slick666: (lets hope they do this year too)
(11:06:52 PM) ***ausimage_oui can't
(11:06:54 PM) cprofitt: I am going to try to apply for my Visa this week...
(11:07:03 PM) ausimage_oui: visa?
(11:07:05 PM) cprofitt: but I have to find out what documentation for my birth I have...
(11:07:11 PM) Slick666: what?
(11:07:17 PM) Slick666: it's ontario
(11:07:20 PM) cprofitt: I may need to gather parental information to get the visa
(11:07:21 PM) hal14450: OLF
(11:07:24 PM) Slick666: it's like Democracy lite up there
(11:07:35 PM) ausimage_oui: you only need a passport or edl
(11:07:39 PM) cprofitt: and as of July you will need a Visa or special drivers lic. to get back in the states
(11:07:47 PM) cprofitt: I am sorry... passport is what I meant
(11:08:02 PM) Slick666: Just say your an american and therefor a very important person so let you through
(11:08:03 PM) Slick666: ;)
(11:08:06 PM) hal14450: and it's land of the scared home of the fascists here when you try and cross the border
(11:08:18 PM) cprofitt: they will not Slick666
(11:08:20 PM) ausimage_oui: it is only 30 for the edl on top of your normal license
(11:08:23 PM) hal14450: getting out isn't a problem it's getting back in
(11:08:26 PM) cprofitt: and if I tell them I was born in Canada...
(11:09:09 PM) hal14450: fubar
(11:09:37 PM) cprofitt: exactly
(11:09:42 PM) hal14450: i got to watch them march all the non white people off the train last year
(11:09:52 PM) cprofitt: so I need to see if my certificate of birth is good enough or not for the passport
(11:10:02 PM) cprofitt: I will be driving...
(11:10:04 PM) cprofitt: no train
(11:10:09 PM) cprofitt: and I have priced out the hotel already
(11:10:13 PM) cprofitt: $200 for the two nights
(11:10:19 PM) hal14450: train is great for relaxing
(11:10:29 PM) ausimage_oui: cprofitt:  maybe wiki page for those going?
(11:10:41 PM) hal14450: just the border trip back in is the worst part
(11:11:05 PM) ausimage_oui: to arrange rides and lodhging, meeting up etc
(11:11:06 PM) Slick666: Ducky and I will probably be car pooling
(11:12:08 PM) ausimage_oui: next then?
(11:12:48 PM) Slick666: yes
(11:13:11 PM) ausimage_oui: k  Loco Approval...
(11:13:32 PM) ausimage_oui: next meeting is July... should we go for it?
(11:13:37 PM) ausimage_oui: or wait
(11:13:39 PM) cprofitt: ausimage_oui, good suggestion
(11:13:48 PM) ausimage_oui: yw cprofitt
(11:13:53 PM) cprofitt: approval application
(11:14:09 PM) cprofitt: I do not want to apply again and have a failed application for the fourth time
(11:14:17 PM) ausimage_oui: pleia2: you abouts?
(11:14:31 PM) ausimage_oui: yeah me niether
(11:14:40 PM) cprofitt: as I look at the benefits I am not even sure they are worth the effort involved
(11:14:44 PM) Slick666: what?
(11:14:51 PM) Slick666: I'm sorry guys I'm lost somewhere
(11:15:14 PM) cprofitt: getting the loco to be an approved loco
(11:15:18 PM) ausimage_oui: there is a last step for any loco...
(11:15:22 PM) pleia2: what month was the last attempt?
(11:15:32 PM) cprofitt: we applied in march and were denied for a second time or third time or what not
(11:15:37 PM) cprofitt: March pleia2
(11:15:43 PM) pleia2: I think you're good to reapply
(11:15:56 PM) cprofitt: I personally would prefer to put it over the top and wait until January of 2010
(11:15:57 PM) ausimage_oui: what are our chances?
(11:16:08 PM) ausimage_oui: pleia2: ?
(11:16:10 PM) pleia2: remind them that you applied then, that they said to complete the tasks on the schedule and you should come back in 3 months
(11:16:17 PM) pleia2: ausimage_oui: high
(11:16:21 PM) pleia2: you did what they asked
(11:16:23 PM) cprofitt: by then we may have more activity than 25 or so state combined
(11:16:39 PM) cprofitt: pleia2, we did that the last time as well... and got denied
(11:16:52 PM) Slick666: hmmmmm
(11:16:57 PM) pleia2: cprofitt: howso?
(11:17:12 PM) cprofitt: the NY team applied last year and was told to do more... and come back...
(11:17:18 PM) pleia2: this time around there were pretty specific instructions on "do more"
(11:17:19 PM) cprofitt: we did...
(11:17:24 PM) pleia2: yeah, last time it was pretty vague
(11:17:38 PM) cprofitt: I can not speak to the other approval meeting as I was not there though
(11:17:41 PM) pleia2: they wanted you to complete all the tasks you had planned for these 3 months, you have
(11:17:49 PM) cprofitt: so I am going based on ausimage_oui telling me about it
(11:18:14 PM) ausimage_oui: i think that was our first time :/
(11:18:24 PM) Slick666: I wouldn't be discouraged about the failed attempts
(11:18:32 PM) ausimage_oui: I had it out with getting on the approval schedule
(11:18:38 PM) Slick666: as long as we can show progress it shows that there is a real desire in the state :)
(11:18:45 PM) pleia2: they did ask you to come back in 3 months with those tasks completed :)
(11:18:46 PM) ausimage_oui: yeah
(11:18:50 PM) cprofitt: pleia2, I am not discouraged
(11:18:58 PM) pleia2: I know
(11:19:18 PM) cprofitt: I do think that one more rejection would end the ability of the LoCo group in Rochester to muster members who care about trying though
(11:19:27 PM) cprofitt: we had some very strong reactions the last time...
(11:19:59 PM) cprofitt: and I think that 'response' would catch more wind this time around
(11:20:11 PM) Slick666: do we need to get more people involved
(11:20:13 PM) Slick666: ?
(11:20:18 PM) cprofitt: that is why my thought was to go for over-kill
(11:20:24 PM) cprofitt: like I did with my Ubuntu membership
(11:20:30 PM) Slick666: have multiple members write a letter or e-mail
(11:20:35 PM) ausimage_oui: Slick666: I think there is some NYS = NYC concern
(11:20:44 PM) ausimage_oui: when !=
(11:20:49 PM) cprofitt: I waited several months after getting told I should apply before I put my application in
(11:20:55 PM) cprofitt: and got approved on the first app
(11:21:02 PM) pleia2: the NYC folks had a release party organized on facebook, didn't they?
(11:21:08 PM) pleia2: even if that was none of you, it can go under your events
(11:21:08 PM) ausimage_oui: no
(11:21:16 PM) cprofitt: pleia2, they may not have done it...
(11:21:19 PM) pleia2: NYS != NYC, but you are in the same state :P
(11:21:21 PM) ausimage_oui: they squabbled it to death
(11:21:26 PM) pleia2: hmm
(11:21:28 PM) cprofitt: they talked about it until the event date past and never actually met
(11:21:37 PM) cprofitt: NYC = NYS like Paris = France
(11:21:52 PM) pleia2: and yet paris is part of the french loco
(11:22:04 PM) ausimage_oui: i feel that maybe our hurdle
(11:22:24 PM) cprofitt: true pleia2 but holding back a state due to one part of it not being active is IMHO wrong headed
(11:22:26 PM) ausimage_oui: paris is kicking it though
(11:22:29 PM) cprofitt: and counter-productive
(11:22:35 PM) hal14450: well all i can say is we're FOSS freaks here take it or leave it we'll promote it regardless
(11:23:04 PM) cprofitt: I know there is some concern on the team that the NYC issue is what has caused issues
(11:23:15 PM) cprofitt: I do not share those views, but perhaps they are correct...
(11:23:35 PM) ausimage_oui: pleia2: i think the concern here maybe the ubuntu isa giving some of or communtity may end ruining it
(11:23:44 PM) Slick666: is there something we can do down in NYC to help muster support?
(11:23:58 PM) Slick666: would that help get the state alligned for an application?
(11:24:10 PM) pleia2: ausimage_oui: hm?
(11:24:17 PM) cprofitt: Slick666, while that is a valid question why should one city of several in a state be critical?
(11:24:40 PM) pleia2: cprofitt: the council likes to see a lot of the potential for a team realized
(11:24:43 PM) cprofitt: that is tantamount to saying the rest of the state, regardless of activity level, does not matter
(11:24:44 PM) ausimage_oui: some feel ubuntu not pullin their end... and not recognizing them only adds
(11:24:47 PM) Slick666: the same reason the politician only stick to NYC
(11:24:53 PM) Slick666: people
(11:25:02 PM) cprofitt: pleia2, so NY City is what they are really after?
(11:25:04 PM) Slick666: you could also argue.....
(11:25:14 PM) cprofitt: Perhaps they should do what they did for Chicago then
(11:25:19 PM) pleia2: cprofitt: no, that's not the impression I got
(11:25:24 PM) cprofitt: and let the rest of NY State not be tied to the dead weight
(11:25:25 PM) Slick666: if they can't make it in NYC, why should the reast of the state florish
(11:25:29 PM) pleia2: but there is a feeling of "you have the biggest city in the country in your state, why not have events there?"
(11:25:30 PM) cprofitt: ah... pleia2 good...
(11:25:33 PM) Slick666: while I don't agree it might be a perspective
(11:25:37 PM) cprofitt: I would have been shocked if they did...
(11:25:44 PM) pleia2: pennsylvania wouldn't have gotten approved without Philadelphia and Pittsburg having done stuff
(11:25:51 PM) hal14450: we do our part here so canonical can acknowledge that and ride our coattails or let us keep on truckin'
(11:26:08 PM) pleia2: it might hurt your team since NYC can't get their act together, but it helps smaller teams
(11:26:20 PM) pleia2: you can't expect new jersey to be as active as france, for instance
(11:26:39 PM) pleia2: but jersey had events as their little state could handle, did a lot of work
(11:26:41 PM) cprofitt: pleia2, so even if Rochester, Buffalo, Ithaca and Waterloo have events they will not be satisfied due to NYC not having events
(11:26:50 PM) Slick666: I'm thinking we might have an opportunity for an inroad to NYC
(11:26:55 PM) pleia2: cprofitt: I didn't say that, I was explaining the reason why they would like to see NYC events
(11:26:57 PM) cprofitt: Most of Jersey is closer to NY City than I am
(11:27:12 PM) pleia2: 23:24:17 < cprofitt> Slick666, while that is a valid question why should one city of several in a state be critical? <-- answering this
(11:27:32 PM) ausimage_oui: hmmm
(11:27:35 PM) cprofitt: pleia2, I am sorry... getting confused with hypotheticals and reality
(11:27:50 PM) Slick666: if I might step in here
(11:27:57 PM) ausimage_oui: pleia2: do you thinkwe can argue for a split?
(11:28:00 PM) Slick666: the 2010 Debian conference is scheduled for NYC
(11:28:06 PM) cprofitt: I will be honest if the efforts of many are wasted simple because we live in the wrong geographic location that would be offensive
(11:28:08 PM) Slick666: (first time in USA)
(11:28:27 PM) pleia2: ausimage_oui: no, but I think your upstate work is plenty (as I've said, you've done what the council asked)
(11:28:34 PM) ausimage_oui: k
(11:28:54 PM) ausimage_oui: just wondering
(11:28:56 PM) cprofitt: pleia2, so you agree that NY City is not a holding back factor
(11:29:03 PM) hal14450: i'm not getting down on NYC here myself since there is activity there it's just such a massive city you really can't expect them to get it together like upstate without some hiccups
(11:29:19 PM) ausimage_oui: hiccups?
(11:29:44 PM) pleia2: cprofitt: yes, but I don't think it'll get in the way of approval
(11:29:53 PM) ***ausimage_oui would claasify their situation a little worse
(11:30:27 PM) hal14450: we're like a few apartment buildings compared to NYC
(11:31:08 PM) ausimage_oui: yeah but i sometimes feel it is a different world from us
(11:31:21 PM) hal14450: because it is
(11:31:27 PM) ausimage_oui: but that digressess
(11:31:27 PM) pleia2: cprofitt: boredandblogging in #ubuntu-us is friendly :) might want to give him a nudge to look over your app if you're unsure
(11:31:36 PM) pleia2: cprofitt: explain the concern about another failed attempt
(11:31:59 PM) cprofitt: pleia2, that is a good idea...
(11:32:08 PM) ausimage_oui: pleia2: you have ideas on getting support to attend nyscate?
(11:32:25 PM) cprofitt: do you think there would be harm in going for the over-kill approach and waiting until December / January?
(11:32:28 PM) pleia2: financial support?
(11:32:30 PM) pleia2: cprofitt: nah
(11:32:34 PM) ausimage_oui: yeah
(11:32:37 PM) cprofitt: pleia2, already helped me ausimage_oui
(11:32:45 PM) cprofitt: she helped me talk to jcastro
(11:32:49 PM) ausimage_oui: oh k just windering
(11:33:01 PM) cprofitt: pleia2, the only issue I have is I have not gotten a response back from jcastro
(11:33:21 PM) cprofitt: my assumption is that the answer is no, and do not want to bother him or jono repeatedly
(11:33:34 PM) cprofitt: as that may harm chances for backing later (another year)
(11:33:39 PM) pleia2: cprofitt: I think you're right that it's no :(
(11:34:01 PM) pleia2: cprofitt: was it just a single email? A poke about it might not be a waste of time
(11:34:16 PM) pleia2: canonical typically doesn't lend financial support to locos though
(11:34:57 PM) cprofitt: pleia2, it was two emails, three or four pokes and a question to SABDFL during open week
(11:35:09 PM) pleia2: ah
(11:35:33 PM) pleia2: did sabdfl give a clear answer?
(11:35:41 PM) cprofitt: no
(11:35:50 PM) pleia2: unsurprising :)
(11:35:57 PM) cprofitt: asked me to talk to jcastro or jono
(11:36:03 PM) ***pleia2 nods
(11:36:38 PM) ausimage_oui: we have only upcoming left so when we are ready...
(11:36:56 PM) cprofitt: I am ready
(11:37:03 PM) ausimage_oui: k...
(11:37:30 PM) ausimage_oui: I have only one announcement here...
(11:38:26 PM) ausimage_oui: I am working on a lug for my area...
(11:38:45 PM) ausimage_oui: It is tenatively called ULLU finger lakes
(11:38:57 PM) Slick666: Upper Lake Linux Users
(11:39:00 PM) Slick666: ;)
(11:39:10 PM) ausimage_oui: http://linux.ausimage.us/ <=website
(11:39:47 PM) cprofitt: nice make sure you spam some Linux message boards
(11:39:53 PM) cprofitt: like linuxquestions.org etc
(11:40:10 PM) ausimage_oui: so if you are out between Rochester Syracuse and Ithaca check the site
(11:40:30 PM) ausimage_oui: ahhh... I am not on many of those boards :/
(11:40:30 PM) TheDukeNY: sorry I can't add to the conversation, it has been interesting but I need to be up early for something important tomorrow. I will keep you updated. good night
(11:40:42 PM) ausimage_oui: thanks TheDukeNY
(11:40:54 PM) Slick666: night
(11:41:12 PM) ausimage_oui: I think Lugor and Rochester Loco have a pile of activity planned there...
(11:41:19 PM) TheDukeNY: Oh
(11:41:38 PM) TheDukeNY: And the problem with getting NYC together is because of the cost issue, I really think it boils down to cost
(11:41:46 PM) TheDukeNY: hopefully these BN college places can help
(11:41:52 PM) ausimage_oui: not sure about buffalo, syracuse, binghamton, ithaca, albany etc
(11:41:55 PM) TheDukeNY: I told cp I will give them a call
(11:42:12 PM) cprofitt: TheDukeNY, I will try to research more places as well...
(11:42:14 PM) ausimage_oui: cool TheDukeNY we don
(11:42:19 PM) TheDukeNY: once again good nite
(11:42:25 PM) ausimage_oui: we don't encounter that here as mch
(11:42:27 PM) cprofitt: getting a faculty sponsor from an IT department can help as well
(11:42:32 PM) cprofitt: night TheDukeNY
(11:43:09 PM) ausimage_oui: I think that finishes the agenda 
(11:43:21 PM) ausimage_oui: anything that needs to be added?
(11:43:28 PM) cprofitt: no
(11:43:32 PM) TheDukeNY is now known as TheDukeNY-afk
(11:43:41 PM) cprofitt: I do think we need to move the meeting to 9pm permanently
(11:43:55 PM) cprofitt: pleia2, and I are involved in an 8pm meeting on some Mondays
(11:44:07 PM) cprofitt: pleia2, thanks for giving us advice... you are always helpful and supportive
(11:44:08 PM) ausimage_oui: that is fine with me
