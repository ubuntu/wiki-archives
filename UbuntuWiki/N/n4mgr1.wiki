Hello, My name is Matthew Robertson and I am the President and founding member of Southwest New Mexico IT Solutions, LLC. I have been using Ubuntu since 2005 with Breezy Badger. I have used Fedora, Red Hat and other variations of Linux and feel that Ubuntu is by far the best O/S hands down. I have been extremely impressed with the support available through the community and feel this is the best O/S on or off the market. 

I have been advocating the use of Ubuntu among friends and associates for a few years now and believe that as time goes on Ubuntu will rival MS in both quality(which I feel it does now) and number of users. Needless to say, I am very optimistic for the future of Ubuntu and hope the progress made in the last few years continues.
