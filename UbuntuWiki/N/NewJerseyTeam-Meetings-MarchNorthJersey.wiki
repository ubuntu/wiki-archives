There was a lot of discussion about whether to have the meeting in New Brunswick or Hoboken, so if there's anyone from Hoboken that can't make it, let me know and I'll see what I can work out.

This should be a good compromise for those in Freehold / Red Bank that wanted to have a separate meeting. Once again, Let me know if it's not.
