The New York Ubuntu !LoCo will be celebrating the release of Ubutunto 10.10 "Maverick Meekrat" on Saturday November 6th 2010. Local events have been organized across the state and will coincide on the same date and times. Online activities will include IRC discussions as well as Video and Audio feeds to select local events.  

=== Online Events ===
We are planning on live video streaming from all three of our local events so that people who can not make one of the three events can participate as well.
