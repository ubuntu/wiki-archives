=== Summary ===

Open folders if the user drags something over them.

=== Rationale ===

The current drag&drop behaviour requires two open Nautilus windows if the drop target is not available on the desktop. This requires preparation and slows down the user.

A somewhat better behaviour would open a folder as soon as the user drags something over them. This should also apply to entries in the shortcut list and the folder button in the location bar. They should open in the same window.
