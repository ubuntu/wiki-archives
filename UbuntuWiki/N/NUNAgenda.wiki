* Do we restart advertising? -- RyanKavanagh  * What will we do in mid-january when classes run out? Loop? Ask for new topics? etc -- RyanKavanagh   * What about asking a Team to give a Marketing Speech on how to get involved every other weekend (where there isn't a course)? -- RyanKavanagh   * What about a mailing list type course, where every week, we send out an email with a link to a piece of documentation that would interest and affect a large portion of users, 5-10-20 questions based on it, and the answers to the previous week's questions. Also, they mail the list any questions they have on the course material (NOT everyday questions, they can go to kubuntu-users, ubuntu-users, etc, for those). -- RyanKavanagh   * What about making it a great big Ubuntu School, geared towards all users in all ubuntu subjects, (like merge with motu-school, etc), or have teams give courses (instead of or as well of a Marketing Speech) -- RyanKavanagh  * Feedback? Comments? What should we change? What should we keep? -- RyanKavanagh  * Goals for the future     -- RyanKavanagh  * Where is the NUN going? -- RyanKavanagh  * ''Add to the agenda here'''
