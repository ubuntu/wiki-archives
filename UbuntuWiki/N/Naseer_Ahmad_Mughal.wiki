__TOC__

I am Naseer Ahmad Mughal (نصیر احمد مغل) a computer engineering graduate from PIMSAT, Islamabad, Pakistan. The first and last thing you should know about me is that the machine called computer is my soul and heart and I can’t live without it. Just like water to me.

I am a freelance web designer/developer and a volunteer web development expert who loves to learn through innovative ideas and inspiration. My expertise includes extensive ASP and PHP coding. I can provide solutions from membership based sites to credit card driven e commerce applications.

I love my work and its like my passion. So the quality is no compromise. Having worked in over over 30 software projects, I have the right skills to develop database driven complex applications like CRM solutions.
