Back to year 2005, three year ago, when I was working in Microsoft, I received an ubuntu live CD. People hand in hand happily, smiling.<<BR>>That's a magic of life. If I didn't get that CD, probably I'm not here now. The most interesting point of our life is its flexibility.<<BR>>People live in this world, not only to earn money, enjoy love or kill time, but should also contribute to this world.<<BR>>Here I find another path to my destiny.<<BR>><<BR>>Neil Sun, April 15, 2008, 4:44 pm.
