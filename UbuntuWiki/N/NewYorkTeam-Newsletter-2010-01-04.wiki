=== NY LoCo Team Newsletter January 04, 2010 ===
==== A Letter From the President ====
!LoCo Members and List Subscribers:

First let me say Happy Holidays to everyone -- drive safe and have a
great time with friends and family.

I wanted to let you know that I have updated the official Wiki site with
events and goals for 2010.

Events:
The events page now has the events that I was aware of through April of
2010. If your area is having an event that is not listed please let me
know and I will add it. Also, if you would like to have an Ubuntu
presentation given at your local group please contact me as well. While
I may not be able to attend I will try to locate a person that is
willing and able to present.

Highlight Events:
!EdTech Day @ Ithaca College: This event is an Educational Technology
Conference held at Ithaca College. The Ubuntu !LoCo works with Fedora
Ambassadors and the Ithaca Free Software Foundation to sponsor booths
and give presentations. Last years event saw us distribute over 800 CDs
in roughly 2 hours. We work with on-disk.com to produce the CDs. If you
would like to sponsor some CDs for the event please contact me and I can
arrange contact with on-disk.com

!BarCamp 5 @ RIT: Last year two !LoCo members attended this event along
with two Fedora Ambassadors. The event was a load of fun and very FOSS
friendly.

White Hat Security Day @ Rochester: This event is a security focused
event. Last year we worked with the event sponsor to obtain a booth and
gave a presentation on Linux security tools. The turnout for our
presentation was overwhelming and the activity at our booth was high.
This year the vendor approached us to ask what we would be willing to
do. The current plan again includes a booth with CD give-a-ways, but
this year we may be giving several presentations.

Goals:
The Goals include local, regional and national goals this year. The !LoCo
needs help establishing active contacts in the NY City and Albany areas.
If you would be willing to assist us in those areas please contact me.

At your service,

Charles Profitt
NY State Ubuntu Local Community President
