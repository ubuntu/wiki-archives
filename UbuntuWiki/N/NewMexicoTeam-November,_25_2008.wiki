Transcript: 

<pre>
<dthomasdigital> Hello all got tons going on be back in about 30 min
<jimrz> good evening ... sorry to have been out of touch for so long, but 'twas unavaidable ... sure glad to be back
<dthomasdigital> glad to have you back.
<jimrz> thanks
<dthomasdigital> Installing new sub woofer for the computer prey so rocks on the PC now
<Shoadow56> Good day gentlemen!
<[mando]> Hey dthomasdigital and Shoadow56
<[mando]> :)
<Shoadow56> Haven't talked to you in a while how have you been [mando]?
<[mando]> Very very busy, it seems my teachers made these three days (I'm off on Thursday and Friday) as hard as possible.
<Shoadow56> Yeah, I know how that is, trying to pack everything in before you leave. Hoping you wouldn't forget probably.
<[mando]> Yep.
<[mando]> Had a test yesterday, one today, and one tomorrow.
<Shoadow56> Eww, sorry.
<gcleric> evening.
<Shoadow56> You there protonchris?
<dthomasdigital> Hello all
<gcleric> dthomasdigital: howdy
<[mando]> Evening, gcleric
<[mando]> :)
<gcleric> hey [mando]!
<gcleric> =)
<[mando]> How are you?
<gcleric> I'm ok and you?
<jimrz> hi everyone
<kenneth> hi everyone
<gcleric> howdy all.
<gcleric> small rant..... ZFS ROCKS!!!!!!
<dthomasdigital> Still working on my project from hell found out to day that one of the motu's was bad and a fire wire card.
<Shoadow56> gcleric, does it work on linux?
<gcleric> dthomasdigital: drag. you know I see motu and I see Masters of the Universe... =P
<gcleric> Shoadow56: via fuse. there's actually a packages called zfs-fuse.
<dthomasdigital> Sorry moto is a device that turns analog audio to digital and transfers it in to a SQl database.
<Shoadow56> gcleric: Is it any faster for you?
<gcleric> Shoadow56: I an admin of a few Netapp SANs and ZFS is just like the Netapp WALF file system... I love it!
<Shoadow56> gcleric: Haven't heard of WALF before, have heard of ZFS.
<gcleric> Shoadow56: take a peek... http://twitpic.com/m0d7/full
<gcleric> Shoadow56: I should have typed WAFL not WALF. =)
<dthomasdigital> Worf?
<gcleric> Shoadow56: say you want to create a raid pool or zpool it looks like....
<dthomasdigital> Agenda Page for tonights meeting https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NewMexicoTeam/November,_25_2008
<gcleric> zpool create vol0 raidz /dev/sad1 /dev/sdb1 /deb/sdc1
<gcleric> the you can create virtual volumes....
<gcleric> zfs create vol0/home/gcleric
<protonchris> Hey everybody. I just got home from a long trip. I probably won't be around much.
<gcleric> hey protonchris!
<tritium> Hi protonchris.
<jimrz> hi protonchris
<Shoadow56> gcleric: So you can create entire virtual directories on a RAID-like system?
<Koolguy> Good evening, all
<dthomasdigital> Meeting time in 2 min
<jimrz> hi Koolguy
<Shoadow56> gcleirc: Wait, let me rephrase: You can create entire directories on 'virtual Raid-like directories'?
<gcleric> Shoadow56: yup! with dynamic stripes. so you can add more storage (/dev/sdd1) to your pools as you need it.
<Koolguy> Looks like I am still logged in from work two... there are two of me
<gcleric> Shoadow56: oh and the block level snapshots are cool too.
<Shoadow56> gcleird: Can be used as a server File system?
<Koolguy> two=too
<dthomasdigital> So ready to start folks?
<jimrz> +1
<tritium> Let's go, dthomasdigital.
<weazzle> +1
<gcleric> Shoadow56: we'll talk later..
<tritium> agenda: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NewMexicoTeam/November,_25_2008
<dthomasdigital> cool, I give the floor to gcleric, he's been busy.
<tritium> Hi deinerson1.
<gcleric> So has every one seen.... https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Endorphin_Power_Company_Ubuntu_Install_and_Support/WirelessNetwork
<tritium> gcleric: topic 1 is yours...
<jimrz> good evening Source3
<deinerson1> hello all
<tritium> Hi jimrz. Good to see you again.
<source3> hello
<jimrz> thanks tritium...good to be back
<weazzle> Howdy jimrz
<jimrz> hi weazzle
<gcleric> so has everyone had a minute to review the diagrams?
<dthomasdigital> +1
<jimrz> +1
<source3> -1
<gcleric> source3: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Endorphin_Power_Company_Ubuntu_Install_and_Support/WirelessNetwork
<tritium> gcleric: what was used to measure signal level, etc?
<source3> ok
<gcleric> wavemon
<tritium> good deal
<gcleric> so lets start by talking about running cable.
<jimrz> when did you have in mind?
<gcleric> as I see it if money was not an issue the distance it too long for CAT5 or 6... I'd run fiber.
<dthomasdigital> I got a fiber switch
<gcleric> 2 of them? with SFX modules?
<dthomasdigital> yep off of and old SAN, gathering dust.
<genfool> cost of fiber per foot?
<gcleric> so i've actually priced it out 300ft of multimode fiber = $1050
<Koolguy> Ouch
<gcleric> yup!
<Koolguy> How many strands for that price?
<tritium> And how much will Cat5e cost?
<gcleric> dual strand.
<gcleric> tritium: it's not the cost at this point but distance. the recommend max for CAT5 or 6 is 90m
<gcleric> 100m can be done but you need pretty beef switches.
<dthomasdigital> Can we get by with strings and tin cans?
<tritium> gcleric: can you not use a switch or whatever every 100 ft or so?
<gcleric> tritium: but in case you are wondering I found a place online that is selling CAT5e for $147/1000ft.
<tritium> Whatever the wired equivalent of a repeater is.
<tritium> gcleric: yes, can you please give me that URL?
<jimrz> gcleric: is that 90m or 90ft for cat?
<gcleric> tritium: there is a 150ft conduit. and little power in the crawl way.
<tritium> gcleric: gotcha
<gcleric> jimrz: 90meters. 260ft
<dthomasdigital> Great turn out tonight, thanks to all for coming.
<tritium> So, a device after the first 150 ft (crawl space/conduit junction) might work, if there were a convenient place (and power)
<gcleric> tritium: the solid red on the diagram in the conduit. and the dotted red line is from the crawl space.
<jimrz> 295.275590551181 according to my calculator's conversion thingy
<gcleric> dthomasdigital: Sam and Dave may be joining us.
<tritium> jimrz: whoa! easy there on the significant digits! ;)
<jimrz> they gonna sing "Soul Man"?
<jimrz> ;)
<dthomasdigital> jimrz just aged himself.
<tritium> gcleric: right. I understood that. What's at their junction point? Is there power?
<dthomasdigital> gcleric did the devices you found pan out?
<jimrz> nature has been doing that to me for a loooong time
<Shoadow56> Would it be worth it to upgrade to CAT6 if you do decide to use RJ-45?
<gcleric> the conduit terminates into the crawl space under one of the rooms on the SE corner.
<gcleric> dthomasdigital: they should arrive sometime around on friday.
<tritium> gcleric: bottom line, it seems your recommendation is wireless?
<tritium> And, the signal measurements seem to indicate it is feasible.
<gcleric> tritium: not entirely.
<dthomasdigital> Could we do a mix of both wired and wireless?
<gcleric> it seem that there is an issue with the rooms acting like faradys cages.
<tritium> not surprising
<gcleric> as noted on the diagram.
<tritium> Where?
<gcleric> I will not know for sure if wireless will work until I recieve the open-mesh routers.
<gcleric> so I can start testing.
<gcleric> where is says "wireless reading inside room 15"
<dthomasdigital> I like the idea of mesh and we could afford it too.
* tritium wonders what units wavemon's output is in. dB?
<tritium> gcleric: OK, I see the "-" now that I didn't see before.
<gcleric> the signal level and signal to noise levels listed are in dB.
<tritium> So, not knowing the units, the link quality numbers appear good.
<tritium> S/N is not too bad, but signal level -- ouch
<gcleric> yup.
<gcleric> but I think we can compensate with the new routers. if all works out but we'll see when they arrive.
<Shoadow56> Just a quick off topic question if I could? Are the OpenMesh routers just running firmware that allows them to interact like they do, and could it be done with regular routers flashed with dd-wrt?
<tritium> Good question, Shoadow56. Not offtopic at all.
<Koolguy> I thought dd-wrt could do it
<gcleric> Shoadow56: they are a custom flash. https://www.open-mesh.com/store/products.php?product=Open%252dMesh-Mini%252dRouter
<gcleric> the routers can act as AP, bridge, or repeater. they are designed with hotels, apartments and campuses in minds.
<Koolguy> Sounds cool
<tritium> We could all take turns hand-carrying packets back and forth from the residents' rooms to the router, and back.
<gcleric> Koolguy the price point if these work is better.
<Shoadow56> Is it necessary to use one in every room or do they have enough coverage to only use two or three for this project?
<gcleric> tritium: =)
<tritium> gcleric: :)
* tritium wants to thanks gcleric for going over to EPC on Sunday, making all these measurements, and making the pretty diagrams
<jimrz> +1
<Koolguy> I second that
<gcleric> Shoadow56: nope if you look at the second diagram you'll see that my thoughts are to use a couple repeaters at the right locations in a couple rooms to boost the over all signal.
<dthomasdigital> +1 the eric rules
<gcleric> no worries!
<Shoadow56> What kind of internet connection do or will they have?
<gcleric> nope If i did I would include ZFS in the linux kernel.
<gcleric> =)
<jimrz> comcast
<gcleric> jimrz: is 100% correct.
<deinerson1> +1
<Shoadow56> Are the pipes gonna be big enough for the load you are planning?
<tritium> gcleric: Sam might join via IRC?
<gcleric> hi deinerson1! did see you join. =)
<dthomasdigital> Don't forget we need to do the whole LTS upgrade too.
<jimrz> yep
<gcleric> tritium: he mentioned that he might make it. but I think he's busy.
<tritium> gcleric: that would be cool
<tritium> dthomasdigital: and get wireless kiosks in the cafe, etc.
<deinerson1> Sam is in mtg, but hopes to join soon
<gcleric> sweet!
<dthomasdigital> lots to do but "we can do it"
<gcleric> ok so ethernet over power.
<weazzle> Is EOP for real?
<tritium> deinerson1: that rocks
<tritium> weazzle: yes, sir!
<gcleric> weazzle: it is an option but...
<gcleric> I can;t seem to find equipment that will allow a single IDF point to many client nodes.
<tritium> gcleric: nor I. I think you're correct.
<Shoadow56> http://www.altair.org/labnotes_POE.html
<gcleric> EOP would also still require a means of accessing the ethernet in the community building. wireless or wired run.
<Shoadow56> Wait, wrong link, sorry.
<gcleric> Shoadow56: do you have a EoP solution that can do one to many?
<weazzle> I imagine that would just work like a hub...
<Shoadow56> The only problem I have with the EoP solution is that there is no way of knowing how the building is wired electrically. You may be able to get a connection in the first building, but the second building is a crapshoot.
<Shoadow56> Which I believe is what someone else pointed out earlier.
<gcleric> Shoadow56: you are correct. We would need a means of some sort of wireless bridge from point at to point be or a wired run.
<Shoadow56> Well would it be possible to test with just one set of EoP connectors?
<gcleric> so all things said wireless looks like the best option, not without it's faults but...
<tritium> gcleric: it's at least worth trying the tests you propose with the mesh routers
<gcleric> Shoadow56: sure? Does anyone have a pairing?
<Shoadow56> I mean, would it be possible to say, have your wireless routers set up in the main building, the use an EoP connection to get the internet out to the community hall?
<gcleric> tritium: I've purchased 3 routers and 2 - 7 dbi antenna.
<tritium> gcleric: yes, and we need to split the cost
<jimrz> definitely +1
<dthomasdigital> yes at least if it works others could buy what we need.
<gcleric> tritium: if the test work we will need to buy additional routers and wallplates.
<Shoadow56> My bad, the other way around: Use an EoP to get a guaranteed (if it works) connection out to the Waterman Building?
<dthomasdigital> mr money bags....
<gcleric> dthomasdigital: not for long if the economy does not improve. but I should mention we stressed tested out avaya phone system today with mortgage rates it 5.25%
<jimrz> bet that did give it a workout
<dthomasdigital> Hey I heard the word "laysoffs" not for us but for some other state agency's today.
<gcleric> dthomasdigital: yeeeouch!
<jimrz> indeed
<tritium> The outlook for the labs looks bad under the new administration
<gcleric> so on topic does anyone else have any solutions or ideas?
<gcleric> does the spec'd idea meet with everyone's agreement?
<gcleric> if it works.
<gcleric> =)
<tritium> gcleric: works for me
<source3> signal through electrical system...never tried it bu apparently it works
<dthomasdigital> I'm so in trouble bejewled twist works in wine
<jimrz> oooops
<tritium> source3: makes sense
<dthomasdigital> So as it stands what's the next move with EPC?
<source3> use the existing electrical system to carry the signal
<dthomasdigital> what to see if the mesh will work?
<gcleric> dthomasdigital: could be worse. I've spent the last 2 weeks playing with ZFS on Ubuntu 8.10 server, OpenSolaris, FreeBSD.
<jimrz> dthomasdigital: did you really have that much extra time
<tritium> dthomasdigital: nothing -- it's invisible ;)
<gcleric> source3: yup!
<jimrz> gcleric: did you try the open solaros/ubuntu hybrid and, if so, how did you like it?
<gcleric> jimrz: yup and it's ok...needs a lot of work before it's really like Ubuntu but cool idea.
<dthomasdigital> Hey folks I just realized that November is our 1 year anniversary being am official LoCo.
<gcleric> dthomasdigital: so the next step.
<gcleric> dthomasdigital: sweet!
<dthomasdigital> So when should we upgrade the lab?
<jimrz> gcleric: thought so. as well. will have to give it a spin
<gcleric> the next step is when the open-mesh routers arrive arrange to go over to EPC and start testing.
<dthomasdigital> Sounds good to me gcleric
<jimrz> +1
<gcleric> dthomasdigital: I thought we agreed on dec 20th-21st?
<dthomasdigital> So that date is set? Might be a good time to test the router too or should we do that sooner?
<gcleric> deinerson1: if the routers arrive friday are you free to lend a hand?
<gcleric> anyone else want to help test?
<jimrz> sure
<tritium> gcleric: sure
<dthomasdigital> if I'm free I'd love to.
<Shoadow56> Careful driving around on Friday! You might get hit by crazy soccer moms!
<dthomasdigital> Black Friday
<gcleric> Shoadow56: stay away from the malls!!!
<tritium> Oh, this weekend? Can't -- holiday travel, time with family, etc.
<gcleric> =)
<dthomasdigital> I got suckered in to put up lights the weekend
<gcleric> tritium: we can post pone?
<Shoadow56> I can't I have to work that day. At least I work in the afternoon so it won't be as bad. Plus nobody brings their computers in unless they are not very smart.
<tritium> gcleric: no, don't hold things up on my account. Thanks, though.
<tritium> I'd love to help out, but not if it means delaying progress.
<gcleric> I will update the EPC wiki pages and plan out testing.
<dthomasdigital> dthomasdigital wondering of Ubuntu makes a onesy for the soon to be little tritium?
<dthomasdigital> Wow updated wiki pages ;)
<tritium> dthomasdigital: I sure hope so ;) There will also definitely be a little linux penguin in Jr.'s future. ;)
<gcleric> dthomasdigital: with the economy the way it is I'm sure that there is going to be a push towards linux and open source ...
<dthomasdigital> Lord knows the State is moving fast int hat direction, sure was easy to talk them into Zimbra.
<Shoadow56> gcleric: We can only hope.
<gcleric> Shoadow56: =)
<gcleric> I have a crazy idea for the linuxfest.
<Shoadow56> Shoot!
<gcleric> what about an online linuxfest?
<Shoadow56> How?
<jimrz> hmmmm
<genfool> crazy
<gcleric> i.e. via DimDim or something like it.
<dthomasdigital> I'm for any and all ideas about LinuxFest
<gcleric> video, audio, presentations, world wide availability...
<dthomasdigital> Are we ready to talk about LinuxFest we done with EPC talk?
<gcleric> and its cheaper then renting space..
<tritium> Please shoot me. There's another hour of Dancing with the Stars.
<gcleric> dthomasdigital: yup...unless anyone has anything lese.
<source3> tritium: bang
<tritium> source3: thanks!
<Shoadow56> tritium: Come on, don't you love that show?
<tritium> Shoadow56: no, but apparently our house-guests do..
<gcleric> well i need to hope off... take care everyone... have a great Turkey day!
<source3> time for me to go eat diner. bye
<dthomasdigital> see ya soon gcleric
<gcleric> laterz
<tritium> bye, source3
<dthomasdigital> Well just have a small update on Linuxfest
<jimrz> ok
<dthomasdigital> Started the process of setting up the non-profit, will have to have a board of directors. to move forward.
<deinerson1> Sam sends his regrets.
<tritium> deinerson1: please wish him well, and say hello to him for me.
<jimrz> +1
<dthomasdigital> Jim and Mike if you want to serve on the board I would love you too, and I'm in talks with some one from the NMLUG to be on the board as well.
<tritium> dthomasdigital: thanks
<jimrz> works for me
<dthomasdigital> Cool I'll send you both the information.
<jimrz> thanks
<Shoadow56> What has been produced in terms of marketing material for the Linuxfest?
<jimrz> good job getting the non=profit started
<tritium> dthomasdigital: do I get a free hat or fleece jacket? :D
<dthomasdigital> Also I have some numbers from the convention center and it just might be doable there.
<dthomasdigital> I'll make t-shirts
<jimrz> :)
<dthomasdigital> Shoadow56 nothing much as of yet, we are still getting the edges ironed out.
<dthomasdigital> However we do have www.newmexicolinusfest.org
<dthomasdigital> www.newmexicolinuxfest.org
<Shoadow56> If possible, I would like to be a part of that. I have become semi-accomplished at desktop publishing and I would like to try and learn Scribus transitioning from InDesign.
<Shoadow56> If you like, I could whip up a few things this week and show you at the next meeting.
<jimrz> cool
<dthomasdigital> Shoadow56 looks like you just gave yourself a job, send me an email with your contact info
<tritium> That sounds fantastic to me.
<Shoadow56> Sounds good. Now I have an excuse to learn Scribus!
<jimrz> :)
<dthomasdigital> oh and we really do have a real sponsor the law firm setting up the non-profit is donating there time.
<jimrz> nice
<dthomasdigital> So that all I have for now,.
<tritium> Thanks, dthomasdigital :)
<dthomasdigital> Fantastic meeting, feel like we are getting things accomplished.
<tritium> Agreed.
<jimrz> +1
<deinerson1> +1
<dthomasdigital> now to get kenneth to give me his chumby
<weazzle> +1
<dthomasdigital> wow did that not sound right.
<Shoadow56> Chumby?
<weazzle> heh
<jimrz> Shadow56: http://www.chumby.com/
<jimrz> fun toy
<Shoadow56> BTW, is our logo set in stone or is it open for ideas? Because I have a semi- interesting idea for a logo.
<jimrz> all ideas welcome
<tritium> Shoadow56: we can have multiple logos
<dthomasdigital> please dear god make a better logo Shoadow56
<Shoadow56> K, now I have to try and learn inkscape too, lol.
<tritium> An SVG logo would be nice.
<Shoadow56> SVG?
<tritium> scalable vector graphics
<dthomasdigital> SVG rules for logos
<Shoadow56> Oh, wait... It's been a long time since I've heard that.
<Shoadow56> I've been out of publishing for a while.
<tritium> Much more appealing to the eye when you need to resize them.
<tritium> Time for me to get going. Good night, New Mexico!
<jimrz> good night tritium
<dthomasdigital> see ya tritium have a great holiday
<tritium> Happy Thanksgiving, everyone!
<jimrz> Happy Thanksgiving
<dthomasdigital> wow almost 20 at the meeting tonight fantastic
<kenneth> yup
<jimrz> biggest turnout yet?
<kenneth> saw asus eeepc's at target
<dthomasdigital> almost we had over 20 once, but I really like the group now lots of people getting involved, jusy what we wanted.
<jimrz> nice price, too
<dthomasdigital> did yo get one kenneth?
<kenneth> thing about it
<kenneth> but target just has the celeron one's
<jimrz> thought I saw them there with atom proc also
<Shoadow56> kenneth: You aiming for an Atom proc?
<kenneth> yes
<jimrz> either at the one on Paseo or, maybe it was in TX last week
<dthomasdigital> The atom one is much faster but I added 2 gigs of ram to mine and that's just what it need runs nice and fast now.
<kenneth> it was at the paseo del norte one, on a endcap
<dthomasdigital> Got mine at the Rio Rancho Target
<kenneth> best buy is listing at 279.99
<dthomasdigital> Wife is all ready in bed and the boy is going to bed, time to fire up beyond the red line and blast some cylons.
<jimrz> kenneth: have seen at several Target's...pretty sure at least one had the one with Atom proc...not sure which one
<jimrz> go get'em
<jimrz> have fun
<dthomasdigital> http://www.game-warden.com/bsg/
<dthomasdigital> I was thinking that kenneth needs a eee cause he has so few gadgets.
<Shoadow56> dthomasdigital: I'll be sending you my information. Is your e-mail on the wiki?
<dthomasdigital> email dthomasdigital@dthomasdigital.com
<Shoadow56> Well that's easy.
<Shoadow56> I'll be seeing you then! Have fun with your game!
<dthomasdigital> Getting a team together for the LinuxFest and you just joined
<Shoadow56> Yes, I did, lol. Doing something I love. Linux and designing!
<dthomasdigital> besides jim loves t-shirts with cool logos on them
<jimrz> way true
<Shoadow56> Well I have a few different ideas for logos, so we'll see what happens. We may be making a cafe-press site.
<dthomasdigital> Just send meetings notes out via the mailing list.
<dthomasdigital> Not on the mailing list go here https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-us-nm
<Shoadow56> You mean for the stuff I'll be working on?
<dthomasdigital> Not on launchpad go here https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-newmexico
<dthomasdigital> just sent meeting not out via the mailing list, damn fat fingers.
<dthomasdigital> lord notes out via mailing list.
<jimrz> darn fingers ;)
<dthomasdigital> I'm out see you all soon.
<Shoadow56> Night!
<Shoadow56> I'm heading out too, good night all.
<deinerson1> g'night
<jimrz> good night
<jimrz> think I better be running along, as well
<jimrz> good night all
