=== About Me ===

My name is Ahmed Sghaier, also known as Neo31. I am a Tunisian technology enthusiast who followed a Master's degree in Network Security and Services as well as a Software Engineering degree. And currently seeking a good Ph.D opportunity.

The first time I have heard about the Tunisian community was in fall 2008 when I started following the community online since then.<<BR>>
My first contribution was in Software Freedom Day 2009 where I had my first contact with the awesome Tunisian members. And since then, my journey with Ubuntu-TN have started and I learned a lot about Ubuntu, FOSS and the community.<<BR>>All than inspired to be the founder with Anis El-Acheche the first FLOSS club in our university. As well as we have supported the opening of other FLOSS clubs in other universities.<<BR>>
During the following years we have supported the opening of other FLOSS clubs in other universities.

I have been approved as a FreedomFighter member of Ubuntu-TN community in the beginning of 2010 and joined the management committee board in 2011.<<BR>>
During 2012 I was following the activities with our LoCo contact offering assistance when possible. And later, in 2013 I have been approved to take LoCo contact responsibilities for Ubuntu-TN.<<BR>>
On the other hand, I am currently the secretary general of the NGO CLibre promoting FLOSS and open data.

==== Personal Linux Experience ====

I have first tried GNU/Linux in 2002 (Knoppix, Live Suse, Fedora Core and Mandrake 8), than it has become my primary operating system since fall 2005 as Mandriva and Fedora 7 came out.

At the same time, I have experienced with my first Ubuntu distribution and I have become interested in the distribution as I became more involved with Ubuntu-TN community in the beginning of 2009.

As my knowledge about GNU, FLOSS and Linux have grown, I have tested many Linux distributions along with some BSD and UNIX distributions.<<BR>>
But currently, I am still loyal to Fedora and Ubuntu as my main PC distributions.

=== Contributions ===

Since I have joined Ubuntu-TN I had the chance to learn a lot from the community and especially about the community. I first started giving back to the community the favor of learning, before things get reversed as I got used to community contribution. Even if I am always learning from our community now I am always giving every thing in every way possible that helps our community.

Briefly, it became my second family.

==== Events : Conferences, workshops, install parties and others ====

Most Ubuntu-TN events are listed on our <nowiki>[[TunisianTeam-Events|Events]]</nowiki> page. You can find events details, reports, photos and blog links on that page. Our <nowiki>[[TunisianTeam-TeamReports|monthly report]]</nowiki> may sometimes contain further details or information.

Following are 25+ IRL events I have contributed to, either as a speaker in conferences, workshop trainer and presenter, assistant, organizer, coordinator or a combination of these.

During these events I have worked with members of Ubuntu-TN community and sometimes with members of other FLOSS communities, organizations, universities and clubs. I am very thankful to everyone who contributed to these events in any way possible.
