__TOC__

At this point any new packages that are not in the archive must be packaged and submitted for inclusion into the archive. This is in preparation for FeatureFreeze where we stop introducing new features, packages, and APIs, and concentrate on fixing bugs in the development release.

If a package is not in the archive and it's not been submitted for inclusion to the arvhive by this date it will not be included in the release.

Exceptions have to be approved by the release management team. They should be granted if the new package:

* contributes to high-priority ''Releasename''Feature''''''Goals,
* is a reasonable fix for an important bug,
* other exceptional circumstances, as judged by the release managers.

See FreezeExceptionProcess for details.
