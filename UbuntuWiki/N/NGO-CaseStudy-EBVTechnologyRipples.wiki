The Results of this case are all product of the effort in the Technology Ripples Project at Escuela Bella Vista, Maracaibo Venezuela and PO-TE (Tu pote es tu tesoro) geared by <nowiki>[[http://velugmaracaibo.org.ve VELUG-Maracaibo]]</nowiki>. It is an initiative to create a way to give children in poor schools and orphanages the opportunity to interact with technology in their learning process. This project is based on a sustainable model that maintains a balance between environmental protection and social equality. The idea is based on donations to get hardware that is considered "out of date" and put it to work again by using software that lets you work with an excellent operability. The software provides a range of applications to enhance skills with the devices of the computer, mathematics, logic activities, tools, office. Ubuntu could very well provide the software platform for this to happen.

=== Purpose / Problem Statement ===

The project seeks to provide an opportunity for children and young people with fewer resources to access knowledge through computers. In recent times, providing computers to schools is more and more difficult considering the high cost of procurement of equipment and maintenance. This creates a digital divide for those who unfortunately can not gain knowledge of or with the help of computers. As Humans depend on using computers for daily routine task, Email, banking, government services, et all, the importance of having knowledge about how to use computers is essential. person who does not possess basic computer skills is an incomplete person.

==== Mission ====

Provide children and young people with little resources the opportunity to interact with computers through software that allows them to learn skills and tools that are useful in the development, implementation always considering free software tools paramount int he achievement of our goals.

==== General Purpose ====

Bridging the gap of technology as a learning method and a tool for development of the child and adolescent channeling donations upgraded computers and giving training to the young minds of tomorrow.

==== Specific Objectives ====

* Computer-Oriented donations. 
* Reconditioned computers with free educational software.
* Train volunteers to teach children and young people to use the tools. 
* Courses-basic educational tools suite, office suite, with skills-input devices of the computer (keyboard, mouse). 
* basic programming for children.

=== Challenges ===

===== Technical Challenges =====

* No Internet, This makes it difficult installing, mantaining a basic Ubuntu install.
* Old Hardware does not always install from standard procedures.
* All hardware donated is different and therefore it is difficult to conjure a simple installing.

===== Other Logistical Challenges =====

* Having enough volunteers to cover the work to be done.
* Knowledge on best practices is often needed to save time and to better share a way of doing things.

=== Achievements ===

An initial batch of 4 computers were donated to 2 schools in remote areas as a result of this initial effort. "Casa Hogar Nido Alegre" and "Escuela Basica Los Pescadores". Both schools received 2 machines with Ubuntu 8.04 Hardy Heron.

* Pictures from when the computers were being set up, <nowiki>[[http://picasaweb.google.com/voices.in/DonandoPCS#]]</nowiki>, they had to be redone after the release of Ubuntu Hardy Heron 8.04 LTS.

* Pictures from Intenational Day @ Escuela Bella Vista, the moment where computers where ready to be shipped <nowiki>[[http://picasaweb.google.com/voices.in/DAInternacional#]]</nowiki>.
