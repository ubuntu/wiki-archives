== Official Ubuntu Hour ==

'''What:''' Meet and discuss Ubuntu goodness

'''Where:''' Krankie's Coffee, Winston-Salem

'''When:''' Saturday, February 13 2010

'''Time:''' 11:00am

Dewey (BugeyeD), Mark (_marx_), Joe (magedragon25), and John (jcg) braved the blizzard to gather at Krankie's for some soul-warming FOSS with a side of hot coffee.

Collectively we installed/configured grub2, discussed the merits of command-line work and root access, and in general had a rockin' FOSS time.

 (!) I wonder whether these events should be renamed, as so far each has lasted at least two hours ...
