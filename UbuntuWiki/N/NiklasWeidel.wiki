__TOC__


Cheers, this is where I'll upload pics of experimental things and graphics that have no special category and/or which doesn't belong to a proposal quite yet.

== Short bio ==
I'm a 26yr old swedish student, formerly IT consultant, graphics artist in advertising and entrepeneur. Feel free to contact me at weidel@gmail.com - all feedback much appreciated! :)

Currently involved with the Edgy art team. 

I'm still not linuxified enough to tolerate Gimp, so I'm a Photoshopper. (Please don't bully me!) If anyone wants PSD originals for my ubuntu-work to tweak or play with, just send me a mail.

== 22 july - wallpapers ==

Uploaded some more <nowiki>[[Artwork:Incoming/EdgyProposals/WallpaperProposal|wallpaper proposals]]</nowiki> to the wiki. I've also uploaded a 1600x1200 version of the glass flower. <nowiki>[[attachment:wall_weidel_glassflower_hires.jpg|Click here to download it.]]</nowiki>

== 16 july - Golden ubuntu logotype ==

<nowiki>[[File:goldlogo_weidel_bg.png]]</nowiki>
<nowiki>[[File:goldlogo_weidel.png]]</nowiki>

Many hours spent tweaking, and some heavy filtering. Could, in some incarnation or another, be useful for marketing purposes, style guide or alike.

== 16 july - Textured ubuntu circle ==

<nowiki>[[File:texturedlogo_weidel.jpg]]</nowiki> 
<nowiki>[[File:texturedlogo_weidel.png]]</nowiki>

Did this at the same time I did the goldlogo, so lots of the same techniques and filters involved.
