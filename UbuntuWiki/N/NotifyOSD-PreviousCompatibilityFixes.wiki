__TOC__


Ubuntu and upstream developers have made fixes to several programs to make their notifications compatible with Notify OSD and the Desktop Notifications Specification. This is an alphabetical list, by package name, of the projects where fixes have been merged into the upstream code. (Fixes that have not yet been implemented or merged upstream are listed in the main <nowiki>[[NotifyOSD]]</nowiki> specification.)

==== banshee ====

* When a new track began, a notification bubble appeared with a “Skip this item” button. The bubble still makes sense without the button, so the button was made conditional on whether the notification server supports `actions` ( (./) <nowiki>[[http://launchpad.net/bugs/327640|bug 327640]]</nowiki>).

==== dropbox ====

A compatibility problem with Dropbox was <nowiki>[[http://forums.getdropbox.com/topic.php?id=7029&replies=1|reported]]</nowiki> (registration required) and <nowiki>[[http://forums.getdropbox.com/topic.php?id=7099&replies=3|fixed]]</nowiki> (registration required).

==== gnome-do ====

* When updates are available for Gnome Do plug-ins, a notification bubble appears that says “Updated plugins are available. Click here to update.”. This should be converted to an alert box:
 <nowiki>[[File:gnome-do-updates.jpg]]</nowiki>

* When Gnome Do cannot run a command, or cannot enter text mode, it displays a notification bubble appears that, when clicked, closes and takes a notification area icon with it. Instead …

==== transmission-gtk ====

* When a download finishes, a notification bubble appeared with an “Open Folder” button, and an “Open File” button if only one file was downloaded. Transmission should instead follow the same approach as for <nowiki>[[#Firefox|Firefox]]</nowiki>. That is, a notification bubble should not appear, the main window should open <nowiki>[[http://library.gnome.org/devel/gtk/stable/GtkWindow.html#GtkWindow--focus-on-map|unfocused]]</nowiki> (if it is not open already), the completed download should be selected in the list, and the window should request attention. Transmission 1.51 included changes to “Play nicely with Ubuntu's new notification server”.

==== update-manager ====

The availability of updates is no longer shown using a notification area icon and notification bubble pointing to it. Instead, Update Manager opens automatically, <nowiki>[[http://library.gnome.org/devel/gtk/stable/GtkWindow.html#GtkWindow--focus-on-map|unfocused]]</nowiki> and in the background (<nowiki>[[http://launchpad.net/bugs/333284|bug 333284]]</nowiki>). (When opened manually, Update Manager should still open focused and frontmost as usual.) This fixed (./) <nowiki>[[http://launchpad.net/bugs/175166|bug 175166]]</nowiki> ("click the icon" instruction dangerously confusing) and (./) <nowiki>[[http://launchpad.net/bugs/33605|bug 33605]]</nowiki> ("Updates available" popup should hide when update-manager starts).

So that the window does not open inappropriately:

* When security updates are available, Update Manager opens automatically within one day, and displays those security updates plus any non-security updates that happen to be available.

* When non-security-only updates are available, Update Manager opens automatically whichever is later: (a) one week after it was last open, whether that was manually or automatically, or (b) one week after updates were installed by any `apt`-powered method, including `apt-get` or `aptitude` (<nowiki>[[http://launchpad.net/bugs/334952|bug 334952]]</nowiki>).

* When no updates are available, Update Manager does not open automatically at all.

* When Add/Remove Applications, Synaptic, or a similar graphical tool is open (''i.e.'' if apt/dpkg is locked) at the moment Update Manager would be scheduled to open, it waits until they are closed (<nowiki>[[http://launchpad.net/bugs/334935|bug 334935]]</nowiki>).

The automatic opening means that Update Manager will often be the first window people ever see on a newly-installed Ubuntu system. Therefore, the text at the top of the Update Manager window is customized to be more welcoming.

To make it easier to configure the Update Manager behavior, a “Settings…” button has been added to the bottom left of the Update Manager window that opens the “Updates” tab of Software Sources ( (./) <nowiki>[[http://launchpad.net/bugs/334959|bug 334959]]</nowiki>).

==== update-notifier ====

Post-update information is no longer advertised using a notification area icon and a notification bubble pointing to it. Instead, the post-update information dialog opens <nowiki>[[http://library.gnome.org/devel/gtk/stable/GtkWindow.html#GtkWindow--focus-on-map|unfocused]]</nowiki> directly.

This fixed:
* <nowiki>[[http://launchpad.net/bugs/93624|bug 93624]]</nowiki> ("System restart required" bubble is unnecessary, just use the alert)
* <nowiki>[[http://launchpad.net/bugs/160362|bug 160362]]</nowiki> ("Ubuntu has some information for you.")
* <nowiki>[[https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/urgent-reboot-notification|Urgent Reboot Notification]]</nowiki>
