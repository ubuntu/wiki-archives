'''Topics Discussed'''

* EPC Router and Mesh Network install Feb 7th at 10:00am -- Coffee?

deinerson 1 did some fantastic work on documenting what we can expect with the new mesh router. More information can be found <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Endorphin_Power_Company_Ubuntu_Install_and_Support/wireless_signal_levels|here]]</nowiki>. We are still on for getting the network configured, we still need some Cat5 however. We decided to get 200' of CAT5 and make it Plenum for safety.

We had one agenda item so once we talked about that our minds wondered. Talked about KDE 4.2, cost of some of the Netbook PC's, and <nowiki>[[http://nmlinuxfest.ning.com/|New Mexico LinuxFest]]</nowiki> stuff. Lots of things going on Linux keeps growing in New Mexico.
