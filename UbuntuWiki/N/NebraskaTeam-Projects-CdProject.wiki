| A number of LoCo teams face the problem that they run out of offical CDs from Canonical well before their allotment is due to be renewed; to aid these teams we wish to produce batches of CDs for each of the major ubuntu versions so we can distrobute more freely without worrying that we will run out money.<<BR>><<BR>>'''Organizer:''' David Thacker

Comments about the CD designs here
* Can we get a description of the kind of printing the Massachusetts factory will do for the quoted price?  Is it four-color?

All designs on the packaging and ubuntu covers and the forms they may take.

Note: IsoDisc offered me a lot of different packaging options.  They're all listed here, some of them may be too expensive for us to consider. ~~~~

=== Comments ===

Comments about packaging here.
** Can we get a better description of the Sleeve from the Massachusetts mfg?  Is it windowed?  Is it Tyvek or paper? 

== Commitments ==

* Ubuntu Massachsetts is committed to working with the Nebraska team to produce these CDs and buy a quantity depending on price.
* Ubuntu Nebraska will work with MA and all other loco's to put this together.
