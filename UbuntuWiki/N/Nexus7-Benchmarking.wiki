=== Why Benchmarking? ===

One of the main reasons we've chosen the Nexus 7 as a reference platform is because it will allow us to further refine Ubuntu to work on a mobile ARM device.  One of the best ways to help make Ubuntu better in this regard is to benchmark this device in several ways (i.e., Memory, CPU, Power management).  This will help us find the areas that need the most attention, and will therefore help Ubuntu everywhere (including desktop, server, and cloud!)

=== Types of Benchmarking ===

There are several types of benchmarking planned.  Results can be found on the pages below.
