'''Topics Discussed'''

* SF complex help?

The Santa Fe Complex is a  center dealing with art, technology and science. Dthomasdigital will talk to the director and see about starting some workshops with the group. 

* Ideas for helping local business?

It was decided that working with non-profits might be the way to go. The New Mexico Linux Conference might be the direction when dealing with small business. Deinerson1 will inquire with the  St. Josephs and South San Pedro Neighborhood Assoc. To see if they would be open to working with us.
