__TOC__

=== Overview ===
It is possible to install Ubuntu from the internet by booting from a USB stick or a CDROM.  This method of installation is called ''netinst'' in Debian and that name is used here as well.

=== Getting the Image ===

The images for this can be obtained from http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/netboot. The CD image is called <code>mini.iso</code> (~12MB) and the image for usb keys is called <code>boot.img.gz</code> (~12MB)

=== Preparing for Boot ===

The ISO can be burned to CD with any standard disc burning software, just be sure the ISO is being used as a source image and not just a file on a data disk.  To prepare a USB stick, back up any data that you have on it (any data will be overwritten) and <code>zcat boot.img.gz >> /dev/sdX </code> where X is the letter of your USB stick.
