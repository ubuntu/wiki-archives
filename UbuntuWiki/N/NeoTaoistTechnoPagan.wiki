=== UPDATE ===

'''Nov 30, 2008'''

At the moment I am having an issue installing mysql on my lappy - anyone care to assist me?
<nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=4719036]]</nowiki>

* NOTE* [SOLVED] - for some reason the system was not automatically making the mysql user.
It still does this when an app needs user-level access (like clamav). 

'''**SOLVED**''' I had some custom bash scripts installed and one for 'adduser' was called
BEFORE the system one - so I mucked up the PATH. Fixed path order and all good now.

== About ==

Ok, go ahead and ask - ''"What's up with the name?"''<<BR>><<BR>>
__'''It's the best way I could describe myself.'''__<<BR>><<BR>>
I'm somewhat of a ''new-age'' thinker, ''Taoist'' in the way that I think and approach the world, ''Techno'' because, well, 
I'm a geek ok? Finally, ''Pagan'' - __yes, I am Pagan__ - albeit an eclectic mixture of '''Taoism''', '''Buddhism''', 
'''Wicca''', '''Druidism''', and even some '''Hindu'''. __I'm on my own path and and it's taken me a while to find it.__
<<BR>><<BR>>
So as to why I am here, well I enjoy tinkering with Linux. I started with Mandrake at 7.1 and then tried out FreeBSD 4.2 - 
getting X to work back then wasn't anywhere as easy.  From there I tried Debian and was hooked on it until I found Linux From 
Scratch (LFS). I then found myself in Gentoo Land and was '''very''' happy. I still say to this day that Gentoo is my distro 
of choice, but I do enjoy using Ubuntu and Debian as well.<<BR>>
