It is often the case that a bug report is a support issue rather than a genuine bug. For this reason, Launchpad offers a support tracking system which allows users to receive help on their issue.

Want to help solve these problems? Find the many open support questions <nowiki>[[https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu|here]]</nowiki>.

=== Converting a Report to a Question ===

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| 1. Click the "Convert to a question" at the top of the bug's web page, as shown below. This will mark the bug as "Invalid", create a new question in the answer tracker and link it to the bug.

|-
| 2. In the comment dialog that you receive, post a comment to inform the reporter about your action, and advise them to use the support tracker for any future problems.

<pre>
Thank you for taking the time to report this issue and helping to make Ubuntu better. Examining the information you have given us, this does not appear to be a bug report so we are closing it and converting it to a question in the support tracker. We appreciate the difficulties you are facing, but it would make more sense to raise problems you are having in the support tracker at https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu if you are uncertain if they are bugs. For help on reporting bugs, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ReportingBugs.

=== Assigning Packages ===

It is also a good idea to change the source package beforehand if it's set incorrectly, so that the question will be associated with the correct package in the answer tracker, or edit the question afterwards and assign it to the correct package. If it doesn't pertain to a specific package, change it to "Ubuntu". For help on assigning packages, see <nowiki>[[Bugs/FindRightPackage]]</nowiki>.
