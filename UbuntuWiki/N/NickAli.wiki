__TOC__

Hello, I used to be involved in the Ubuntu community long time ago. Some of the old video episodes of <nowiki>[[http://blip.tv/ubuntu-podcast/|Ubuntu Podcast]]</nowiki> floating around.

My old @ubuntu.com address no longer works. Quickest way of getting a hold of me is through <nowiki>[[http://twitter.com/iamtherealnick|Twitter]]</nowiki> or <nowiki>[[https://plus.google.com/117174056769475261270/posts|G+]]</nowiki>.

What have I been doing since being involved in Ubuntu? <nowiki>[[http://nali.org|Marketing strategy]]</nowiki> kind of stuff at <nowiki>[[http://www.denmarktheagency.com|Denmark {the agency}]]</nowiki>.
