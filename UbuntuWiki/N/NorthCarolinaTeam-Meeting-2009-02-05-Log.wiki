<<BR>>19:35:01 <Citizenjoefriday>	couldn't get ahold of him
<<BR>>19:35:19 <Citizenjoefriday>	i'll try during his office hours tomorrow
<<BR>>19:35:20 <_marx_>	the ccc venue for triangle yall should jump on that
<<BR>>19:36:02 <_marx_>	my thought on the ccc venue was wait until tonight to see what people from that are thought of the location
<<BR>>19:36:40 <_marx_>	ArepaKing: you're still marked away
<<BR>>19:36:48 <ArepaKing>	why don't we create a poll on this? it will also serve as a headcount
<<BR>>19:36:59 <ArepaKing>	ops... sorry about that..
<<BR>>19:37:53 <_marx_>	poll on UForums?
<<BR>>19:37:58 <ArepaKing>	yep
<<BR>>19:38:43 <ArepaKing>	I saw a poll on our forum.. didn't you create that one?
<<BR>>19:39:27 <ArepaKing>	this is the link: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=590221
<<BR>>19:39:54 <_marx_>	no jfrorie did
<<BR>>19:40:02 <ArepaKing>	mm ok
<<BR>>19:40:21 <ArepaKing>	we could create something similar
<<BR>>19:40:27 <_marx_>	looking at a calender...reserve the space
<<BR>>19:40:49 <_marx_>	15 days to go
<<BR>>19:40:55 <_marx_>	to GBJ
<<BR>>19:41:19 <ArepaKing>	Bac said he could take care of the venue reservation. He just need us to decide if that will be the selected venue
<<BR>>19:41:36 <_marx_>	bac: you there?
<<BR>>19:41:43 <ArepaKing>	and the reservation needs to be done at least 2 weeks in advance
<<BR>>19:42:39 <jfrorie>	yipes. I'm back...
<<BR>>19:43:02 <jfrorie>	hey mark
<<BR>>19:43:07 <_marx_>	hey jim
<<BR>>19:43:47 <_marx_>	ArepaKing: my thought was to leave that to people that live in that area
<<BR>>19:44:20 <_marx_>	if everyone here in triangle area is good with that location book it
<<BR>>19:44:44 <jfrorie>	BTW for those interested. I got a new job at the NC research center. Will be working with their 256 node IBM cluster running linux and MPI.  Dunno what flavor...
<<BR>>19:45:05 <ArepaKing>	congratulations Jim..
<<BR>>19:45:15 *	jfrorie is emplyed again!
<<BR>>19:45:30 <_marx_>	yah jfrorie ! very good sir
<<BR>>19:45:46 <Citizenjoefriday>	congrats jim
<<BR>>19:45:47 <ArepaKing>	_marx_ aside of mrdashe, bac and I.. I don't know who else lives around RTP.
<<BR>>19:46:21 <_marx_>	one other...who's not here now
<<BR>>19:46:42 <ArepaKing>	and Cprompt who lives in High Point said that he is willing to travel to Carrboro
<<BR>>19:46:43 <undadecor>	I live there
<<BR>>19:46:44 <_marx_>	still book it sounds great
<<BR>>19:46:57 <undadecor>	Works for me
<<BR>>19:47:20 <ArepaKing>	ok 5 members so far agrees with CCC.. who else is from RTP?
<<BR>>19:48:26 <_marx_>	PTI
<<BR>>19:49:47 <jfrorie>	Who is doing the webcast for the RTP meetup?
<<BR>>19:50:17 <_marx_>	for me I'll have to be in Charlotte on the 20th for testing
<<BR>>19:51:25 <ArepaKing>	the other thing is that the GBJ is from 20th to 22nd... Would you like to meet just the Saturday 21th?
<<BR>>19:51:26 <_marx_>	so i won't likely make ccc on the 21'st
<<BR>>19:51:45 <ArepaKing>	too bad to hear that bud
<<BR>>19:52:13 <_marx_>	but I would like to see a webcast!
<<BR>>19:53:39 <ArepaKing>	if any of the attendees knows how to do the webcast I could take my webcam with me that day
<<BR>>19:53:43 <_marx_>	do we have a location for Charlotte?
<<BR>>19:54:01 <_marx_>	or anywhere else in the state?
<<BR>>19:55:19 <ArepaKing>	_marx_, I don't think we have any other venue proposed
<<BR>>19:56:00 <jfrorie>	I havn't seen anyone else in the charlotte area.  Since there is no prentation, would think that a meeting at a local carbou coffee would be acceptable.  I just need other takers.
<<BR>>19:56:10 *	_marx_ thinking back to regions
<<BR>>19:56:13 <jfrorie>	prentation = presentation
<<BR>>19:56:57 <jfrorie>	ne1 form charlotte are on tonote?
<<BR>>19:57:01 <_marx_>	I know BugeyeD is close by he's on my lug's mailing list
<<BR>>19:57:11 <jfrorie>	tonote= tonite- *sigh*
<<BR>>19:57:22 <_marx_>	but he's mainly a freeBSD guy afaik
<<BR>>19:58:06 <_marx_>	so jfrorie how hard is it to find a place in Charlotte?
<<BR>>19:58:11 *	ArepaKing is wondering how many members are active in this conversation
<<BR>>19:58:43 <_marx_>	12 here now but that counts the bots
<<BR>>19:58:55 <_marx_>	consider this a core group?
<<BR>>19:59:31 <ArepaKing>	yep
<<BR>>19:59:43 *	_marx_ thinks so too
<<BR>>19:59:49 <jfrorie>	Depends on what we need.  I could find a place, but I need taker to make it worth the time.
<<BR>>20:00:26 <_marx_>	jfrorie: are u in a lug?
<<BR>>20:00:53 <jfrorie>	Even the UNCCLUG group is dead.  C-lug is dead.  I can;t find anyone around here.
<<BR>>20:01:04 <_marx_>	geez
<<BR>>20:01:57 *	_marx_ ponders the state of lugs
<<BR>>20:02:03 <_marx_>	wow
<<BR>>20:02:35 <jfrorie>	There is a very nice independent coffee shop that is screaming for business with wifi and counches and everything.
<<BR>>20:03:18 *	jfrorie is not typing on his beloved IBM model M keyboard tonite. 
<<BR>>20:04:41 <_marx_>	what can we do to increase the size and disparity of this core group?
<<BR>>20:05:15 <jfrorie>	What I am wondering is if we can make this a little nicer by have multiple meetings connected via webcasts or something.  That would require a more private venue tho.
<<BR>>20:05:49 <_marx_>	we need reps in the western and eastern parts of the state
<<BR>>20:05:56 <ArepaKing>	I think the meeting that we are planning will serve as a publicity event as well.
<<BR>>20:06:27 <_marx_>	true and we are just getting restarted
<<BR>>20:06:33 <ArepaKing>	correct
<<BR>>20:07:04 <undadecor>	Anyone heading to the TriLUG meeting next week?
<<BR>>20:07:14 <undadecor>	I'll be trying to get the word out there
<<BR>>20:07:48 <jfrorie>	If we can connect the venues, then a small turnout at a remote location would be less of an issue.  Kinda like superbowl parties.
<<BR>>20:08:24 <_marx_>	well I'm going to Plug this month and have already posted there
<<BR>>20:08:31 <ArepaKing>	please allow me to a quick poll here... say "1" if you are planning to attend the meeting if it is held in Carrboro?
<<BR>>20:08:35 <ArepaKing>	1
<<BR>>20:08:44 <Citizenjoefriday>	i can on the 20th
<<BR>>20:08:49 <Citizenjoefriday>	oh, 2
<<BR>>20:08:52 <Citizenjoefriday>	*1
<<BR>>20:08:53 <ArepaKing>	a friday?

<<BR>>20:09:17 <ArepaKing>	oh ok
<<BR>>20:09:22 <jfrorie>	0
<<BR>>20:09:41 -->	cwill747 (n=cameron@adsl-072-148-042-210.sip.rmo.bellsouth.net) has joined #ubuntu-us-nc
<<BR>>20:09:49 <ArepaKing>	ok let's get this started because I can't meet on friday.. here goes a new question
<<BR>>20:09:53 <_marx_>	I'll look harder for a venue in the triad
<<BR>>20:10:20 <undadecor>	1
<<BR>>20:10:35 <ArepaKing>	who is willing to attend the meeting if it is held on Carrboro the 20th? (Vote 1 if you can, Vote 0 if you are not)
<<BR>>20:10:44 <ArepaKing>	0
<<BR>>20:10:52 <undadecor>	1
<<BR>>20:10:53 *	ArepaKing works on friday
<<BR>>20:10:53 <Citizenjoefriday>	1
<<BR>>20:10:58 <Citizenjoefriday>	yikes
<<BR>>20:11:18 <ArepaKing>	come people vote :)
<<BR>>20:11:22 <jfrorie>	0
<<BR>>20:11:48 <jfrorie>	I'm in Charlotte, so I'm pretty much out period.
<<BR>>20:12:44 <ArepaKing>	the 21st?
<<BR>>20:12:45 *	_marx_ is taking the RHCT test 2-20
<<BR>>20:12:55 <_marx_>	in Charlotte
<<BR>>20:13:04 <_marx_>	if I pass...
<<BR>>20:13:31 <_marx_>	1
<<BR>>20:13:37 <ArepaKing>	1
<<BR>>20:13:47 <Citizenjoefriday>	0
<<BR>>20:14:06 <_marx_>	book the place!
<<BR>>20:14:21 <ArepaKing>	bac can you vote?
<<BR>>20:14:23 <_marx_>	look it's a big state
<<BR>>20:14:32 <ArepaKing>	and it is free
<<BR>>20:15:34 <ArepaKing>	I will send a mail asking for people to vote on 20th and 21th....  I think we could reach more people
<<BR>>20:15:45 <cwill747>	0
<<BR>>20:15:49 <_marx_>	see for me I'd drive to Charlotte on Friday, test, drive home, drive east and want to keep going east
<<BR>>20:16:34 <ArepaKing>	if we have more than 4 attendees I will let you know _marx_ so you can give the green light to Bac and reserve the space in Carrboro
<<BR>>20:16:51 <_marx_>	no look
<<BR>>20:17:23 *	ArepaKing is listening 
<<BR>>20:17:34 <_marx_>	my perspective on leadership of a group like this is pretty open
<<BR>>20:19:11 <_marx_>	so book the room, I wonder why anyone asked
<<BR>>20:19:26 <ArepaKing>	ok.. bac are you there?
<<BR>>20:19:37 <_marx_>	I see my role as only an instigator
<<BR>>20:19:56 <_marx_>	a prode to get this bunch moving again
<<BR>>20:20:13 <ArepaKing>	but what really concerns me is that Bac reserves the space and no one shows up
<<BR>>20:20:23 <_marx_>	ah
<<BR>>20:20:42 <undadecor>	Yeah, I think a poll via email, results due tomorrow is a good idea
<<BR>>20:21:04 <ArepaKing>	correct.. we have to have a headcount within our group at least
<<BR>>20:21:52 <ArepaKing>	I will send the question tonight with a due date tomorrow at noon..
<<BR>>20:22:25 <ArepaKing>	what do you guys think?
<<BR>>20:22:33 <undadecor>	Sounds good.
<<BR>>20:22:36 <Citizenjoefriday>	sounds good to me
<<BR>>20:22:37 <_marx_>	sounds good
<<BR>>20:22:59 <ArepaKing>	all right....
<<BR>>20:23:02 <jfrorie>	i agree
<<BR>>20:23:06 <ArepaKing>	good!
<<BR>>20:23:25 <ArepaKing>	I think we can close the venue bullet point for now... :)
<<BR>>20:23:35 <ArepaKing>	guys I have to stepped out for some time
<<BR>>20:23:35 <undadecor>	I hope so ;)
<<BR>>20:23:54 <ArepaKing>	you guys can continue with the second bullet point
<<BR>>20:24:03 <ArepaKing>	b) Fliers
<<BR>>20:24:11 *	ArepaKing is away
<<BR>>20:24:59 <_marx_>	hum
<<BR>>20:25:09 <undadecor>	Are these fliers for the GBJ?
<<BR>>20:25:13 <undadecor>	Or for something else?
<<BR>>20:25:42 <_marx_>	no one has develed any that I know of
<<BR>>20:26:08 <undadecor>	Oh okay, what I meant to ask, was is this bullet point concerning the GBJ?
<<BR>>20:27:46 <_marx_>	next should likely be logo for this team and a stock template for fliers
<<BR>>20:28:00 <undadecor>	Yeah, did cprompt say he was developing a logo?
<<BR>>20:28:09 <_marx_>	yes he did
<<BR>>20:28:14 <undadecor>	Any idea on his progress?
<<BR>>20:28:41 <undadecor>	I know he was having some trouble determining what he could/couldn't do in terms of the trademark policy
<<BR>>20:28:47 <_marx_>	he's marked away now, and I haven't heard from him
<<BR>>20:28:50 <undadecor>	Okay
<<BR>>20:29:28 <_marx_>	I was working on one too unaware of restrictions
<<BR>>20:29:48 <undadecor>	Okay, well in terms of the flier, I can try to work on one and leave a spot for the logo.
<<BR>>20:29:50 <cwill747>	yeah a normal flier template would be great. pretty sure you could put the ubuntu logo on anything
<<BR>>20:30:29 <Citizenjoefriday>	http://www.ubuntu.com/aboutus/trademarkpolicy
<<BR>>20:30:46 <_marx_>	my thoughts were make a generic flier that can be modified for different events
<<BR>>20:31:11 <jfrorie>	Mark, can you send an email to all the users on the forum?  I'm wondering how many people are not on the mailing list and not subscribe to the forum?
<<BR>>20:31:55 <_marx_>	jfrorie: what forum?
<<BR>>20:32:47 <_marx_>	er no I can't send list email to all posters on the nc uf
<<BR>>20:33:49 <_marx_>	undadecor: that would be good
<<BR>>20:34:11 <_marx_>	work on a logo too if you have time
<<BR>>20:34:22 <undadecor>	Okay
<<BR>>20:34:27 <undadecor>	Speaking of the nc uf
<<BR>>20:34:45 <_marx_>	I can make one that conflicts with the specs ;)
<<BR>>20:34:47 <undadecor>	Do we need to get a new moderator since viridari is still one?
<<BR>>20:34:59 <undadecor>	Oh wait
<<BR>>20:35:11 <undadecor>	Are you a moderator _marx_?
<<BR>>20:35:22 <_marx_>	only if we need a sticky post
<<BR>>20:35:27 <undadecor>	Oh okay
<<BR>>20:35:29 <undadecor>	nvm
<<BR>>20:35:29 <_marx_>	no I'm not
<<BR>>20:35:50 <undadecor>	Do we have an active moderator from our loco group then?
<<BR>>20:35:57 *	_marx_ markthecarp there only 9x posts
<<BR>>20:36:07 <undadecor>	Haha
<<BR>>20:36:08 <undadecor>	true
<<BR>>20:37:33 *	BugeyeD bounces in for a bit after being flagged that his name had been mentioned
<<BR>>20:37:42 <BugeyeD>	sup _marx_
<<BR>>20:37:54 <_marx_>	hi BugeyeD
<<BR>>20:38:04 <BugeyeD>	i'm somewhat geographically, uh, stupid
<<BR>>20:38:12 <BugeyeD>	will have to google carrboro to see where it is
<<BR>>20:38:32 <undadecor>	What size of flyer are we looking for?
<<BR>>20:38:33 <_marx_>	west of raleigh
<<BR>>20:39:01 <_marx_>	standard 8x10
<<BR>>20:39:07 <_marx_>	for now
<<BR>>20:39:20 <undadecor>	Okay
<<BR>>20:39:47 <_marx_>	I like the ones with tear offs
<<BR>>20:39:49 *	ArepaKing is back..
<<BR>>20:40:19 <_marx_>	BugeyeD: the other night when I was looking for the cd cleaner disk
<<BR>>20:40:21 <undadecor>	Tear-offs, okay
<<BR>>20:40:28 <cwill747>	Sorry for being so in and out, i'm playing around with Jaunty
<<BR>>20:41:14 <_marx_>	I found suse 7.2 Pro cd's had to come from you BugeyeD
<<BR>>20:41:15 <ArepaKing>	guys I hate to interrupt the fliers discussion but I have a question in regards to the venue. Are we thinking to hold this event two days? or we need to pick (based on the poll) one day?
<<BR>>20:42:10 <undadecor>	Probably pick one based on poll
<<BR>>20:42:12 <_marx_>	I can 't make Friday in Carborro
<<BR>>20:43:04 <ArepaKing>	that's what I thought but I rather ask
<<BR>>20:43:46 <_marx_>	friday in Charlotte somewhere yes
<<BR>>20:43:54 <BugeyeD>	_marx_: why me? because they were pro? i used to buy them all ...
<<BR>>20:44:03 <ArepaKing>	ok
<<BR>>20:44:44 <_marx_>	BugeyeD: nay I got them from you, I didn't have a burner back then
<<BR>>20:45:56 <BugeyeD>	_marx_: gotcha. about the buntoo thingy ... is carrboro the closest for us, or are others in our little triangle meeting elsewhere?
<<BR>>20:46:04 <BugeyeD>	i've been in the channel but definitely not reading everything
<<BR>>20:46:23 <BugeyeD>	s/triangle/triad
<<BR>>20:46:52 <_marx_>	BugeyeD: I used them to run a little website on a dual proc P-90 all good
<<BR>>20:47:44 <_marx_>	BugeyeD: if we can find a closer location for us that would be great
<<BR>>20:48:23 <BugeyeD>	what date are we talking about? i'm busy as heck right now so need to know as soon as possible
<<BR>>20:48:44 <_marx_>	saturday 2-21-09
<<BR>>20:48:49 <BugeyeD>	you are testing in charlotte ... as in exam?

<<BR>>20:49:33 <_marx_>	i'll smoke it
<<BR>>20:49:56 <BugeyeD>	excellent. going for a change in career path?
<<BR>>20:50:05 <_marx_>	hopefully
<<BR>>20:50:17 <BugeyeD>	rhct = trainer? techie?
<<BR>>20:50:32 <_marx_>	redhat c tech
<<BR>>20:50:58 <_marx_>	hope to take others test through out this year
<<BR>>20:51:26 <_marx_>	it's all linux you know
<<BR>>20:51:35 <BugeyeD>	if you land in the right place, the rest may be paid for.
<<BR>>20:51:44 <BugeyeD>	have you talked to thor?
<<BR>>20:52:11 <_marx_>	lol, the son of odin is my father ;)
<<BR>>20:52:13 <jfrorie>	BugeyeD: where are you located?
<<BR>>20:52:39 <BugeyeD>	jfrorie: welcome - just between lexington and winston. i work in winston.
<<BR>>20:53:28 <BugeyeD>	_marx_: smart alec. i meant thor @ presens
<<BR>>20:53:49 <jfrorie>	ok, thx.  Mark, if they do friday, do you want to get together somewhere in clt?
<<BR>>20:54:09 <_marx_>	not so son of odin is my sponsor
<<BR>>20:54:22 <_marx_>	yes jfrorie
<<BR>>20:55:16 <jfrorie>	ok, what I'm thinking is once we finalize the carboro meeting, we annouce a charlotte meetup at the same time.  It will be a public venue so if noone show, no loss.
<<BR>>20:56:18 <_marx_>	sounds good
<<BR>>20:57:11 <jfrorie>	I'll throw some blind emails out on the local mailing lists to see if I get  a bite.  Just let me know when carboro is finalized
<<BR>>20:59:01 <_marx_>	I'd like to see something from Boone = ASU
<<BR>>20:59:34 <_marx_>	Asheville and points east toward Wilmington
<<BR>>21:01:05 <_marx_>	next one is a release party for Jaunty
<<BR>>21:08:03 <_marx_>	I'm out for now
<<BR>>21:08:22 *	_marx_ is away: being with spousal unit
<<BR>>21:09:26 <_marx_>	now no smart alec comments from BugeyeD
<<BR>>21:09:35 <_marx_>	I'm really away
<<BR>>21:09:42 <_marx_>	lol
<<BR>>21:13:24 <BugeyeD>	_marx_: sry, was away talking to my wife. have have stuff planned on that particular day, but we're going to try to move some stuff around.
<<BR>>21:13:51 <BugeyeD>	_marx_: you should be able to count me on that day, carrboro or closer.
<<BR>>21:14:37 <BugeyeD>	and for anyone who cares, i am a right-tool-for-the-job kinda guy. i just happen to think bsd fits most of my jobs the best.
<<BR>>21:15:16 <BugeyeD>	i'm working a lot on ubuntu right now trying to learn/test/eval kvm as a possible replacement for vmware-server.
<<BR>>21:16:12 <BugeyeD>	i've been with vmware since before their first public beta, so it's kind of a hard sell. but i do like knowing the available tools.
