__TOC__

== Who am I? ==
Long story made extremely short: I'm a Norwegian student, living in Narvik. For more information, see my personal home @ http://nitrolinken.net.
== What do I do? ==
As I like contributing to open source projects, there are some things that I do in some of my spare time.
* Translating on Launchpad
* Answering questions
* Reporting bugs

Not the most advanced nor important things, but it is something nice to do.
