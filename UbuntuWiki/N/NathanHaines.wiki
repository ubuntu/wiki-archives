=== About me ===
I'm a computer technician who has been using Linux since 1994, and Ubuntu since 2005.  I've had a lifelong interest in computer programming and am currently a huge fan of Python.  I'm an active member of the <nowiki>[[CaliforniaTeam|California LoCo]]</nowiki>. I enjoy helping others and spreading the word about Ubuntu and other useful Free and Open Source solutions.  I enjoy helping others install Ubuntu and answering any questions they might have.

=== Plans and Goals ===
Ubuntu is truly a marvel of the Free Software community.  The "it just works" goals plus the "be excellent to each other" foundation of the community have made a real impact in the Linux world.  It is my honor and privilege to be involved with such wonderful people.  By continuous, respectful advocacy, Ubuntu can make great inroads towards fixing LP bug #1.  I offer Ubuntu Desktop CDs to interested people and I intend to increase the number of public speaking I do about Ubuntu.

In addition, I plan to become involved in packaging for Ubuntu so I can package my projects for Debian and Ubuntu and help package and maintain other projects.  At the moment, I'm packaging <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/pyroom|PyRoom]]</nowiki> in my <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~nhaines/+archive|PPA]]</nowiki> and have begun the process to have it included in Universe for intrepid.

=== Contributions ===

I have been recommending and offering Ubuntu CDs since May 2005 when I discovered how well it worked.  I have been an active member of the <nowiki>[[CaliforniaTeam|Ubuntu California Local Community Team]]</nowiki> since October 2007 and have created artwork and promotional material.  As part of the LoCo team, I have run booths and given presentations at BarCampLA4, SCaLE6X, LugRadio Live, and on local radio and campuses, both with other team members and as a sole representative of the team and Ubuntu.
