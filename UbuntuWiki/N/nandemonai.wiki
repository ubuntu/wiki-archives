Web Developer and Network Administrator based in Adelaide, South Australia.

I'm a long time Ubuntu user and hope to be of some use in spreading the word here in Adelaide along with helping with the odd project or two. I'm a regular of #ubuntu, #ubuntu-offtopic and now #ubuntu-au on Freenode so if you ever need a hand with something don't hesitate to ask ;)
