Timeline of my involvement in Ubuntu:

On 27 November 2006 I subscribe to the GreekTeam's mailing list at https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-gr and I apply for subscription to the UbuntuGreekTranslators team at https://translations.launchpad.net/people/ubuntu-l10n-el and I also join the Ubuntu Greek Users team at https://translations.launchpad.net/people/ubuntu-greek-users

On 26 November 2006 I found the GreekTeam and decided to join to help with translation to Greek.
