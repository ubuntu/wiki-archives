== What's New In Beta 1 ==

On top of the underlying changes in our Ubuntu core, there are a number of new and interesting things happening for this beta.

The <nowiki>[[NattyNarwhal-TechnicalOverview|Natty Technical Overview]]</nowiki> shows the changes in the rest of Ubuntu.
                                                                                                                                                                                    
=== New Samba Filesharing ===

Thanks to the hard work of RodrigoBelem, we now have a working Samba filesharing system. You can now right-click on a folder in Dolphin, select "Properties" and easily share it with other computers on your network. It will even offer to install the Samba server if you do not already have it.

=== New Language Selector Module ===

We also now sport a new System Language Selector, now integrated into System Settings' Locale section. Now you can easily add, remove and manage languages wish extra security because it does not run as root.
