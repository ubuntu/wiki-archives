19:03:01 <_marx_>	howdy folks
<<BR>>19:03:11 <undadecor>	Hey there
<<BR>>19:03:25 <undadecor>	Decent crowd :)
<<BR>>19:04:04 <EdLind_>	hey
<<BR>>19:04:13 <jfrorie>	hey mark
<<BR>>19:04:28 <alinuxfan>	heya
<<BR>>19:05:02 <_marx_>	10 discounting marco_polo who's is me on my laptop logging
<<BR>>19:05:28 <Hex|xeH>	hi all
<<BR>>19:05:30 <EdLind_>	I'm in Arden.  Half way between Asheville and Hendersonville
<<BR>>19:06:10 <_marx_>	ah EdLind_ I lived in Hooterville for most of the 80's
<<BR>>19:06:47 <_marx_>	Hendersonville of course, we used to refer to it as Hooterville
<<BR>>19:09:03 <_marx_>	how many folks participate in some way in a lug
<<BR>>19:09:41 <undadecor>	Unfortunately I just moved to the area, so not yet
<<BR>>19:09:50 <alinuxfan>	i was living in germany until recently, and i kept meaning to go, but i figured there'd be a language barrier
<<BR>>19:10:16 <jfrorie>	I've emailed every lug in charlotte and have yet to make contact.
<<BR>>19:10:39 <EdLind_>	we are resurrecting the WNCLUG here first real meeting last month.  More scheduled for the Third Thursday of each month.
<<BR>>19:14:23 <EdLind_>	I guess it is now called the Asheville LUG
<<BR>>19:14:54 <_marx_>	EdLind_: I'll pass that on to a friend in Marion
<<BR>>19:15:44 <_marx_>	my thinking is using a lug's resource to hold maybe an installfest and cross promote Ubunut and Linux in general
<<BR>>19:16:19 <EdLind_>	We now have a regularly scheduled meeting time and location for Asheville LUG.  Per the instruction of attendees at last week's workshop, I reserved the Firestorm Cafe & Books back room for every third Thursday from 5pm to 7pm. The address is 48 Commerce Street in downtown Asheville (next to the Purple Building, near the USPS, Jack of the Woods and Prichard Park). So the next meeting/workshop will be January 15th at 5pm.
<<BR>>19:17:23 <_marx_>	sorry yall some bad timing on my part here, wife's home from work confirming her employer is shutting down
<<BR>>19:17:45 <undadecor>	Meeting break?  Or keep going?
<<BR>>19:17:52 <EdLind_>	sorry for you
<<BR>>19:17:58 <alinuxfan>	that sucks
<<BR>>19:18:00 <jfrorie>	sorry to hear mark.
<<BR>>19:18:12 <alinuxfan>	:s
<<BR>>19:18:13 <_marx_>	let's roll, we were pretty sure it was coming yesterday, confirmed today
<<BR>>19:18:44 <jfrorie>	BTW, ne1 with Lucent stock should sell.
<<BR>>19:18:56 <undadecor>	The lug's installfest idea is a good one I think
<<BR>>19:19:19 <undadecor>	Should we try to jump in on one they have scheduled already for this year?  Or help to organize and plan one?
<<BR>>19:19:29 <_marx_>	piggy backing on a larger groups action
<<BR>>19:19:41 <EdLind_>	I agree.  I'd like to see Mythbubtu
<<BR>>19:19:42 <_marx_>	my lug hasn't held one in years
<<BR>>19:20:33 <undadecor>	trilug seems pretty active, anyone know if they have one coming up?
<<BR>>19:20:43 <_marx_>	i organized the last one for PLUG, last official one
<<BR>>19:21:31 <_marx_>	I don't undadecor
<<BR>>19:22:02 <undadecor>	I'll be heading to the next next meeting at trilug since I can't make the one this week
<<BR>>19:22:20 <_marx_>	there was a former member of plug (piedmont lug) that went to nc state
<<BR>>19:22:40 <_marx_>	i've lost touch with him over the years
<<BR>>19:22:45 <undadecor>	We could also try to recruit at some of the college/universities
<<BR>>19:25:26 <undadecor>	Does anyone know if our LoCo team has a logo?  I requested one on this thread:  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=531198
<<BR>>19:27:40 <alinuxfan>	the example looks pretty cool
<<BR>>19:27:41 <_marx_>	afaik we don't cool idea
<<BR>>19:28:37 <undadecor>	Well, should we hit off the three things on our agenda one at a time to make the meeting flow or something?
<<BR>>19:29:28 <_marx_>	ah an organizer :) regions major metro areas seems logical
<<BR>>19:30:10 <undadecor>	Yeah, agreed, what places are represented tonight?  I'm at the Tri area (Wake Forest)
<<BR>>19:30:37 <_marx_>	then there are the more rural areas that could be close to more than one metro area
<<BR>>19:30:42 <jfrorie>	Charlotte metro
<<BR>>19:31:18 <_marx_>	PTI after the airport Piedmont Triad Int, Winston-Salem
<<BR>>19:31:53 <alinuxfan>	I'll be in Pinehurst in a couple months but would be interested in anything in Cary or Fayetteville
<<BR>>19:32:02 <_marx_>	alinuxfan is a long distance member
<<BR>>19:32:30 <alinuxfan>	for a bit yet...i'll be there soon
<<BR>>19:33:38 <undadecor>	Should we try to get someone to organize each area, or is that too organized ;)
<<BR>>19:35:06 <jfrorie>	I would think we need to concentrate on getting participation on the board and mailing list.  I think a lot of people think the gorup is dead
<<BR>>19:35:20 <EdLind_>	I'd like to gather Ubuntu users in the WNC area.  I just have not found any others yet
<<BR>>19:35:36 <_marx_>	you know I'm not sure on that; having organized a couple of installfests it can be amazingly difficult to organize Linux people
<<BR>>19:35:51 <EdLind_>	How can we get the word out?
<<BR>>19:36:54 <alinuxfan>	my favorite tactic is to put live cds in the stores when I am browsing the laptops...helps me check which ones work with wifi too :p
<<BR>>19:37:10 <undadecor>	Nice tactic
<<BR>>19:37:14 <EdLind_>	Just by our nature we are unorganizable :-)
<<BR>>19:37:29 <_marx_>	exactly
<<BR>>19:38:09 <CPrompt^>	ok....what are we talking about :)
<<BR>>19:39:36 <_marx_>	meeting fliers in local computer stores my lug has done that
<<BR>>19:39:48 <undadecor>	That's a good idea
<<BR>>19:39:49 <CPrompt^>	i can help with the fliers
<<BR>>19:39:52 <undadecor>	Not expensive either
<<BR>>19:39:59 <CPrompt^>	i can help design them as well as print them
<<BR>>19:40:12 <CPrompt^>	so that would certainly cut out the cost of printing ;)
<<BR>>19:40:19 <alinuxfan>	that is a good idea
<<BR>>19:40:24 <_marx_>	undadecor did you hear back from the guy on the logo?
<<BR>>19:40:34 <undadecor>	No not yet, but it's only been a few days.
<<BR>>19:40:44 <undadecor>	I'll probably PM him later this week
<<BR>>19:40:52 <undadecor>	Maybe he's taken back his offer, but I guess we'll see
<<BR>>19:41:14 <CPrompt^>	so fliers are a good idea for sure.  what would the fliers be for?  local meeting?
<<BR>>19:41:16 <_marx_>	I know some skilled gimp users that run suse
<<BR>>19:41:21 <alinuxfan>	he hasn't answered that thread in a while....maybe he is just busy
<<BR>>19:41:45 <undadecor>	Yeah, although he did say from the beginning he would PM the image to people I think, maybe I'm mistaken
<<BR>>19:42:05 <alinuxfan>	make sure to add a line about this group on the flier...then other parts can be specified based on the local area's desire
<<BR>>19:46:01 <undadecor>	I assume our wiki url will be them as well?
<<BR>>19:46:19 <undadecor>	and speaking of the wiki, I think it needs a makeover.  Anyone talented at wiki design?  If not I'll take the role
<<BR>>19:46:34 *	_marx_ is willing to try to get plug to do another installfest but that will have to be general Linux, not Ubuntu specific
<<BR>>19:47:35 <alinuxfan>	i used mandrake before ubuntu...but now I can't shake ubuntu (not that i would) but i am not impressed with Suse or Fedora
<<BR>>19:47:55 <_marx_>	I can probably wrangle schwag from several vendors
<<BR>>19:48:00 <alinuxfan>	so, at an installfest, i'd be sure to push ubuntu
<<BR>>19:48:34 <CPrompt^>	need to make sure there are not just a bunch of linux geeks going to show up.  need some people that have never used linux before
<<BR>>19:48:44 <_marx_>	ubuntu does seem to be the most used distro in that group
<<BR>>19:49:17 <_marx_>	CPrompt^: that is the most difficult part of organizing an installfest
<<BR>>19:49:30 <_marx_>	promoting it outside of Linux circles
<<BR>>19:49:45 <alinuxfan>	Ken starks help organize those Lindependence events this summer, from what I rather...it was just a lot of marketing beforehand
<<BR>>19:50:32 <CPrompt^>	_marx_  I agree
<<BR>>19:50:51 <alinuxfan>	i think I remember something about going door to door...but that is definitely resource intensive
<<BR>>19:51:10 <CPrompt^>	could do one of those fliers like "Having Computer Problems?"  and have it advertise an install fest
<<BR>>19:51:22 <CPrompt^>	a lot of people that I speak with have no idea what Linux even is
<<BR>>19:51:30 <undadecor>	Yeah, MA's LoCo team started calling Installfests "Exploration Ubuntu"
<<BR>>19:51:30 <CPrompt^>	or what it means to run it
<<BR>>19:51:32 <_marx_>	ah, local computer clubs, groups that are generic and most likely ms centric
<<BR>>19:51:37 <undadecor>	so that non-geeks would come out
<<BR>>19:52:24 <CPrompt^>	i have had people ask "So what is Linux".  Then after telling some general stuff, they want to know more.
<<BR>>19:52:43 <CPrompt^>	however, there are some that are all about playing games that don't really run on linux
<<BR>>19:52:55 <Hex|xeH>	I've had best buy employees argue with me that Linux is a game, not an OS.
<<BR>>19:53:06 <alinuxfan>	i try to wear linux gear often...i've had a couple people ask
<<BR>>19:53:08 <CPrompt^>	Hex|xeH: that's nice
<<BR>>19:53:24 <_marx_>	really nice
<<BR>>19:53:42 <alinuxfan>	i am working on about 50% market share here where I am right now...enough people are getting sick of the viruses and stuff on XP and the BS of vista...
<<BR>>19:53:43 <CPrompt^>	i have a co-worker that his son has crashed their computer twice in the past 2 weeks.  BSOD
<<BR>>19:53:58 <_marx_>	my license plate is /dev/tk1, nobody gets it
<<BR>>19:54:17 <CPrompt^>	_marx_:  what is tk1 ? :(
<<BR>>19:54:20 <alinuxfan>	and no one here is playing many games...just browsing and chatting
<<BR>>19:54:22 <_marx_>	truck 1
<<BR>>19:54:26 <alinuxfan>	_marx_, nice license plate
<<BR>>19:54:26 <CPrompt^>	ah :)
<<BR>>19:54:45 <CPrompt^>	alinuxfan: that's a great application for Linux then
<<BR>>19:54:49 <_marx_>	used to have /usr/src, that one caught some attention
<<BR>>19:55:35 <alinuxfan>	CPrompt^, i am gonna try to get a couple more in the next couple months...bandwidth sucks, and I have 2 computers 64bit and 32bit so every time, I burn a new aptoncd
<<BR>>19:56:08 <alinuxfan>	depending on the recipients hardware
<<BR>>19:57:04 <CPrompt^>	i always keep a couple of Ubuntu disks with me, I handed out one the other day aamof
<<BR>>19:57:26 <undadecor>	Good idea, I need to start doing that
<<BR>>19:58:20 <EdLind_>	me to
<<BR>>19:58:26 <_marx_>	for regions how about a regional contact person
<<BR>>19:58:46 <CPrompt^>	_marx_: makes sense to have that
<<BR>>19:58:56 <_marx_>	that could be posted on the wiki and maybe the launchpad site as well
<<BR>>19:59:06 <undadecor>	Yeah, sounds like a good idea
<<BR>>19:59:12 <CPrompt^>	where is the wiki?
<<BR>>19:59:21 <undadecor>	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NorthCarolinaTeam
<<BR>>19:59:36 <alinuxfan>	undadecor, beat me to it
<<BR>>19:59:47 <CPrompt^>	cool
<<BR>>19:59:58 <CPrompt^>	right on the Ubuntu site.  Good
<<BR>>20:00:02 <alinuxfan>	ooh, a facebook group
<<BR>>20:00:26 <CPrompt^>	so, what about the fliers?
<<BR>>20:00:56 <CPrompt^>	i go to a lot of places throughout the week.  I can certainly post them places.  Universities, etc...
<<BR>>20:01:16 <undadecor>	Yeah, not a bad idea, and certainly computer stores
<<BR>>20:01:42 <_marx_>	I was thinking of fliers to promote events but fliers to promote the group/team would be good too
<<BR>>20:01:52 <CPrompt^>	be careful about the stores.  some don't like you just leaving stuff
<<BR>>20:02:12 <CPrompt^>	places like Panera Bread don't mind it at all
<<BR>>20:02:19 <CPrompt^>	they have a board there for that stuff
<<BR>>20:02:23 <EdLind_>	I wonder if Best Buy and Circuit City would allow fliers?
<<BR>>20:02:30 <_marx_>	and if they know what Linux is they may not like it because it might hurt their business ;)
<<BR>>20:02:31 <CPrompt^>	just be sure to ask
<<BR>>20:02:50 <CPrompt^>	see if they have a message board or something of the nature.
<<BR>>20:02:52 <alinuxfan>	best buy allows my live cds :p haha
<<BR>>20:02:57 <CPrompt^>	coffee shops is cool
<<BR>>20:03:19 <CPrompt^>	coffee shops (local and Starbucks) have local message boards to leave fliers
<<BR>>20:03:32 <CPrompt^>	B&N, Borders...
<<BR>>20:03:40 <EdLind_>	so do many supermarkets
<<BR>>20:03:45 <CPrompt^>	yep
<<BR>>20:04:11 <alinuxfan>	basically just carry around a couple fliers in the car and maybe one in the pocket just in case
<<BR>>20:04:39 <CPrompt^>	yep
<<BR>>20:04:50 <EdLind_>	we need to make it easy for someom
<<BR>>20:04:57 <CPrompt^>	i can certainly carry them in my car during work
<<BR>>20:05:02 <_marx_>	to find help
<<BR>>20:05:14 <EdLind_>	some one just getting started to join in
<<BR>>20:05:51 <_marx_>	I think there are lots of people out there that have tried Linux in some form and ran into some problem they couldn't solve
<<BR>>20:06:03 <undadecor>	Yeah, definitely tell them about the support forum
<<BR>>20:06:03 <CPrompt^>	oh yeah
<<BR>>20:06:05 <undadecor>	and IRC
<<BR>>20:06:13 <CPrompt^>	irc is great for help
<<BR>>20:06:17 <undadecor>	Although with IRC you might have to give them a tutorial
<<BR>>20:06:19 <undadecor>	or intro
<<BR>>20:06:26 <CPrompt^>	yep
<<BR>>20:06:34 <alinuxfan>	ubuntuforums is always a good place to start
<<BR>>20:06:48 <EdLind_>	I would be willing to place fliers with the NC Ubuntu information and then my local info so we could meet
<<BR>>20:06:51 <CPrompt^>	let them know it's not much different than IM'ing and they will be fine ;)
<<BR>>20:07:01 <undadecor>	Yeah, I think regional contact info should be on the flier
<<BR>>20:07:19 <undadecor>	for meetups or local help
<<BR>>20:08:00 <EdLind_>	does any one have any experience with the "meetup" sites?
<<BR>>20:08:44 <undadecor>	I don't really know what you mean
<<BR>>20:09:00 <_marx_>	limited, I've done a flickr meetup, two linux users 6 ms 2 mac, was fun
<<BR>>20:09:33 <_marx_>	people you "know" online meet ftf
<<BR>>20:09:42 <EdLind_>	https://secure.meetup.com/login/
<<BR>>20:10:01 <undadecor>	oh, I've only done it with Thawte certificate notaries
<<BR>>20:12:58 <jfrorie>	I done meetups before
<<BR>>20:13:40 <_marx_>	I'm going to make some changes to how the mailing list works
<<BR>>20:13:56 <alinuxfan>	what are you gonna change?
<<BR>>20:14:03 <CPrompt^>	_marx_: i never get anything from the mailing list.  has there been anything recently?
<<BR>>20:14:08 <undadecor>	Yes there has
<<BR>>20:14:10 <_marx_>	1-make replies to posts go to the list rather than the poster
<<BR>>20:14:12 <CPrompt^>	i got your email today
<<BR>>20:14:26 <alinuxfan>	yeah, i got the email today
<<BR>>20:14:49 <undadecor>	Check the archives to see if you missed anything:  https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-us-nc/
<<BR>>20:15:03 <_marx_>	right now the default is for a reply to a post to go to the poster
<<BR>>20:15:13 <undadecor>	Yeah, I noticed that
<<BR>>20:15:20 <undadecor>	Good idea to change that
<<BR>>20:15:22 <_marx_>	so a user has to take extra steps to send to the list
<<BR>>20:15:32 <EdLind_>	I just tried to create a WNC Linux meetup group.  It is $6.00 a month
<<BR>>20:15:55 <EdLind_>	I thought it was free with ads
<<BR>>20:16:03 <_marx_>	second a poster will get a copy of their post instead of not getting a copy
<<BR>>20:16:03 <undadecor>	Does anyone else get 2 copies of each e-mail to the list?
<<BR>>20:16:06 <CPrompt^>	yeah, i haven't gotten any of those emails in January
<<BR>>20:16:39 <_marx_>	undadecor: I don't, are they coming to the same address?
<<BR>>20:16:40 <CPrompt^>	hmmmm...maybe that was before I joined
<<BR>>20:16:58 <undadecor>	_marx_: Yes, same address
<<BR>>20:17:53 <_marx_>	undadecor: I'll see what I can find out from the admin pages
<<BR>>20:18:07 <_marx_>	anyone else getting two copies?
<<BR>>20:19:58 <undadecor>	_marx_: actually, it wasn't the same, I guess I had an old e-mail address subscribed, thanks for the tip
<<BR>>20:20:43 <_marx_>	cool, just got an email notice on the removal
<<BR>>20:20:49 <CPrompt^>	_marx_: while you're in there see if they are going to my email address :(
<<BR>>20:21:20 <_marx_>	CPrompt^: did you get the reminder email this am
<<BR>>20:21:40 <CPrompt^>	yeah, I got that
<<BR>>20:21:52 <CPrompt^>	i didn't get the responses that were in the log though
<<BR>>20:22:05 <undadecor>	They weren't from today though
<<BR>>20:22:13 <_marx_>	you're good then, ah, and ah again
<<BR>>20:22:21 <CPrompt^>	gotcha ;)
<<BR>>20:23:21 *	_marx_ sends orc hords to High Point
<<BR>>20:23:30 <undadecor>	So for the fliers, I guess CPrompt will send the source file to the regional people and then they can add info specific to each region?
<<BR>>20:23:39 <undadecor>	Or do it a different way?
<<BR>>20:23:47 <_marx_>	that sounds good
<<BR>>20:24:02 <EdLind_>	sounds good leave a place for the local contact
<<BR>>20:24:10 <_marx_>	maybe you can press that person on a logo
<<BR>>20:24:30 <EdLind_>	I'll take WNC / Asheville area
<<BR>>20:24:31 <CPrompt^>	i'm pretty good with Gimp and such
<<BR>>20:24:46 <undadecor>	I'll take the Tri area
<<BR>>20:24:46 <CPrompt^>	or, you could just send me your contact info and I can edit the file
<<BR>>20:25:02 <CPrompt^>	so...how many fliers do you think should be printed total?
<<BR>>20:25:54 <_marx_>	start small to allow for fine tuning
<<BR>>20:26:15 <undadecor>	I guess it depends on how many regions have representatives too
<<BR>>20:26:16 <CPrompt^>	cool.  if it's not like thousands i can get by with no charge for the printing
<<BR>>20:26:21 <_marx_>	I'll take Winston and points NW, Stoke, Surry Yadkin counties
<<BR>>20:26:29 <CPrompt^>	yes, need to split the regions up
<<BR>>20:26:55 <_marx_>	for me Mt Airy is just as close as G'boro
<<BR>>20:27:56 <CPrompt^>	ouch
<<BR>>20:28:12 <CPrompt^>	undadecor: when you say "Tri" area.  is that Triangle?
<<BR>>20:28:25 <alinuxfan>	i'll work pinehurst/fayetteville when I get there in May
<<BR>>20:28:32 <undadecor>	CPrompt^: Yes
<<BR>>20:28:56 <undadecor>	I think elfick might be in the tri area as well, based on his host name
<<BR>>20:28:57 <CPrompt^>	gotcha
<<BR>>20:29:06 <CPrompt^>	well, i'm in the Gbo / High Point area
<<BR>>20:29:13 <CPrompt^>	anyone else from here?
<<BR>>20:30:55 <EdLind_>	I've got to go.  Do you need my contact info?
<<BR>>20:31:42 <CPrompt^>	EdLind_: sure
<<BR>>20:32:00 <EdLind_>	lindquistgreen [at] gmail.com
<<BR>>20:32:48 <EdLind_>	will there be a post of what transpired?
<<BR>>20:32:48 <CPrompt^>	coo
<<BR>>20:32:51 <CPrompt^>	er...cool
<<BR>>20:33:07 <CPrompt^>	could do an irc log ??
<<BR>>20:33:09 <marco_polo>	EdLind_, sorry I (mark) switched machines, may  I PM you
<<BR>>20:33:20 <marco_polo>	well I'll ask here
<<BR>>20:33:35 <marco_polo>	have you been involved with ncvoter.net?
<<BR>>20:33:42 <EdLind_>	no
<<BR>>20:34:00 <marco_polo>	ok, thought I recognized your name from there
<<BR>>20:34:19 <marco_polo>	I'll post a log to the mailing list
<<BR>>20:34:38 <EdLind_>	we do not need a log just a summery
<<BR>>20:34:45 <undadecor>	Cool, maybe on the wiki as well?
<<BR>>20:35:07 <undadecor>	I'm going to log off as well, my contact info is thomas [at] thomasroten.com
<<BR>>20:35:35 <marco_polo>	gotcha
<<BR>>20:36:20 <CPrompt^>	later undadecor
<<BR>>20:36:25 <EdLind_>	bye
<<BR>>20:36:28 <alinuxfan>	later
<<BR>>20:36:31 <CPrompt^>	later EdLind_
<<BR>>20:36:32 <undadecor>	bye, fun meeting :)
<<BR>>20:36:36 <marco_polo>	siezure undadecor
<<BR>>20:36:42 <EdLind_>	\exit
