== Beta Packages ==
If you want to try beta packages, just add this line to your source repository.
<pre>
deb ftp://ftp.upsa.es/Software/debian/ubuntu/nfsv4/ ./
</pre>

== Other Considerations ==

* Some kernel modules need to be loaded before nfs exports are available. Should we add these to /etc/modules or do it in another way?

* To have kerberos security support, we need a kerberos working system. More info at UbuntuEnterprise

== Hoary Packages ==

You can install backported linux-image (patched with the latest CITI diff) and nfsv4
packages if you add the following lines to your sources.list:
{{{
deb     http://ubuntu.uni-klu.ac.at/ubuntu.uniklu/  hoary  uniklu uniklu-testing                                                                  deb-src http://ubuntu.uni-klu.ac.at/ubuntu.uniklu/  hoary  uniklu uniklu-testing  }}}
Also add the offical Ubuntu backports:
{{{
deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/  hoary-backports  main restricted universe multiverse }}}

The uniklu archive signed - if you want get rid of apt-get warnings:
{{{
$ wget http://ubuntu.uni-klu.ac.at/uniklu-debuild.pub
$ sudo apt-key add uniklu-debuild.pub }}}

To install the backported and modified kernel enter:
{{{
and check if its really downloaded from http://ubuntu.uni-klu.ac.at
