__TOC__

* We had a great discussion about the goals of the team at UDS and there was a lot of interest in it.
* One of the goals discussed was to separate our activities into "Advocacy", "Documentation" and "technical contributions to Ubuntu" and assign contacts for those activities.
* Daniel Holbach reworked the wiki to the new structure.
