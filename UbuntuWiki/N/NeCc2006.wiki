=== Summary ===

Every year at the National Educational Computing Conference the powers at be allow us to run a Free Software Center, usually set up by a team including several people who will be at UBZ.  While we are in Montreal we should make some plans for next year's center.

In particular, we could focus on planning out a solid agenda of presentations, including many, many Moodle talks.  Also, we should focus on more promotion within the conference.  Can we leaflet at other free software related talks?  Can we have more talks in the center that are sponsored by companies like Canonical and Novell?  Can we get some promotion from those companies on the show floor?  Can we get some funding to have a few people at the conference just to work on the above?
