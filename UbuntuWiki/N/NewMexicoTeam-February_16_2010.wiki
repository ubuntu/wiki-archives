19:59 < tritium> Just about.
20:00 < fgleich> hey tritium
20:00 < genfool> damn kids, always getting in a hurry   :)
20:00 < tritium> Hi, fgleich, genfool.
20:00 < genfool> hi tritium
20:01 < tritium> We've got one agenda item tonight: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NewMexicoTeam/February_16_2010
20:02 < tritium> 1) Review the Silver Spur Trade Show booth.
20:02  * tritium was there Saturday morning, along with protonchris, genfool, and fgleich, and overlapped with mneptok a bit in the afternoon.
20:03 < kenneth> Gratuitous Imagery at bottom of https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NewMexicoTeam/trade_show_2010
20:03 < tritium> We gave away all the little make-your-own-penguin pages.  They were a big hit!
20:03 < genfool> where is the link to make more?
20:04 < tritium> Nice pictures, kenneth.
20:04 < tritium> Thank you again for organizing our presence at the show, kenneth.
20:04 < kenneth> http://en.digitalkamera.com/make-a-paper-tux-linux-penguin-in-less-than-15-minutes/
20:05 < tritium> kenneth: that was a great idea!
20:06 < genfool> cool. bookmarked, thanks
20:07 < genfool> what were the thoughts of the meeting, now that it is over?
20:08 < tritium> genfool, fgleich: what were your thoughts?
20:08 < protonchris> I am going to skip out tonight.  Have a good one.
20:08 < tritium> Good night, protonchris.
20:09 < fgleich> g'night protonchris
20:10 < fgleich> I think that the paper cutouts were a great idea, need to get those young kids attention and exposed to linux, also, it's an opening to their parents to learn about linux
20:11 < kenneth> Also to have Edubuntu Disks
20:11 < fgleich> also I think more explanations were in order, I mean, signs and things like that, like about who we are, what we do, what linux can do for them, things like that
20:11 < genfool> mine, thought it was fun, we need info on the group to explain who we are, many asked. I or we need to build a laptop that will display linux for an appropriate amount of time...12 volt battery.
20:12 < fgleich> yes, maybe some toys....people like that eye candy stuff
20:13 < tritium> protonchris and I did discuss the need for a sign, banner, handouts, or business cards, with info on who we, the LoCo, are.
20:14 < tritium> kenneth's 2D barcode business cards are awesome.  Perhaps we could make some for the LoCo like that.
20:14 < genfool> After locked into the gun & blade show, turns out there was a electronics show in ABQ same weekend  :(
20:18 < genfool> I think we did well for a first time, we all see improvements available for a next time, or would we prefer to not do a next time???
20:19 < tritium> I'm sure there will be future opportunities, at various shows and conventions.
20:19 < genfool> I am still waiting to hear from kenneth  and what he thought  :|
20:20 < tritium> And mneptok...
20:20 < kenneth> Next gun show won't be til may 1 and its at the state fair grounds
20:20 < tritium> I'm going to cut out shortly.  I need to spend some time with my daughter before she goes to bed.
20:20 < genfool> cool
20:21 < fgleich> ok so this is about what we discussed before
20:22 < fgleich> I mean, the approximate same items
20:22 < fgleich> is there some web site that shows what future shows are going to be held in this area ?
20:23 < fgleich> anyone know ?
20:23 < kenneth> http://www.itsatrip.org/ +
20:24 < kenneth> any of the convention locations
20:24 < genfool> I had a crazy idea about adding bumper stickers and key chains etc...for sale, help raise revenue for future shows.
20:25 < fgleich> ty kenneth
20:26 < tritium> It's too bad that Canonical closed their U.S. shop.
20:27 < tritium> And their selection has gone down quite a bit.
20:29 < genfool> Is a grass roots platform that we are on. On Sat. am  were several that were using linux already, cool t-shirt or whatever  they may have bought...a little money in the ubuntu-us-nm coffers would go a long ways to future projects.
20:30 < fgleich> penguin popcorn
20:31 < nick125> genfool: It would be interesting to find ways to raise funds
20:31 < fgleich> linux robots
20:31 < genfool> lots of butter, none of the low fat knd.
20:32 < fgleich> penguin coins
20:32 < nick125> Would Canonical/Ubuntu allow us to use their trademarks in order to raise funds for us?
20:33 < tritium> nick125: I believe so.  I will check into the LoCo rules.
20:33 < fgleich> tux the penguin cakes
20:33 < fgleich> and cupcakes
20:33 < genfool> The show, I think was a success. we learned a lot from it. we had fun. If we had a flyer available with the disk explaining who we are and how they can reach us, would help.
20:33 < nick125> tritium: Okay.
20:34 < nick125> Maybe we should setup an IRC client on the site. Speaking of the site...what's the status with that?
20:34 < fgleich> penguin rings
20:35 < fgleich> 'Linux rules, Windows drools' bumper stickers
20:35 [Users #ubuntu-us-nm]
20:35 [@ChanServ  ] [ locobot_4   ] [ smooge ] 
20:35 [ deinerson1] [ mneptok     ] [ tritium]

20:35 [ genfool   ] [ protonchris ] [ woowoo ]

20:35 -!- Irssi: #ubuntu-us-nm: Total of 15 nicks [1 ops, 0 halfops, 0 voices, 14 normal]
20:36 < tritium> nick125: it's basically ready for us to add content.  We can get an update from protonchris next week, perhaps.
20:36 < nick125> fgleich: Where could we get quality bumper stickers printed?
20:36 < nick125> tritium: I think that might be something we should look into.
20:36 < tritium> nick125: agreed
20:36 < fgleich> I don't know, but I'll look into it
20:37 < fgleich> like one color, or multi color ?
20:38 < nick125> Multicolor would be nice.
20:38 < genfool> we want all the colors fgleich
20:38 < fgleich> probably have to have it done it LA then
20:39 < fgleich> it=in
20:40 < nick125> I think we should investigate NM LoCo gear, such as t-shirts, bumper stickers, etc.
20:40 < fgleich> I was going to have a multi color cigarette lighter wrapper made up a few years ago, and no one here in town could do multi color, nearest place was in LA
20:40 < nick125> fgleich: We'll probably have to order it in from somewhere, yeah.
20:40 < fgleich> might get a single color done here though
20:40 < nick125> Does the LoCo have a Paypal account?
20:41 < genfool> another thought on the show, amazing how many people have just never heard of linux.  why I say a grass roots effort to spread the love.
20:41 < fgleich> there is....or was.....a print shop here in town
20:41 < nick125> We should make it easier for people to contribute funds to the LoCo.
20:42 < genfool> nick125,  would make it easier for us to contribute to those that need it.
20:43 < nick125> Maybe we could have "fundraising goals" for certain things, i.e., launch parties, booths, etc.
20:44 < nick125> Maybe recurring donations too, etc.
20:44 < genfool> We do have rules to abide by, we need to understand them... I do not know the rules.
20:44 < nick125> genfool: Yeah, I was about to mention that. We need to make sure that we're within the rules for LoCos.
20:46 < tritium> nick125: I'll take an action to look into the rules.
20:46 < tritium> I'm heading to bed.  Good night, everyone!
20:46 < nick125> tritium: Great. Good night!
20:46 < genfool> seems like it is a workable situation, raise moneys to donate to projects of our interest?
20:46 < genfool> night tritium
20:47 < fgleich> g'night tritium
20:47 < nick125> My primary idea is raising money for LoCo events.
20:48 < genfool> nick125,  exactly, no one knows that linux exist, we need to change that.
20:49 < genfool> everywhere we go, we spread the love  :)
20:49 < nick125> It would also be interesting to see about partnering with local PC places to offer Ubuntu on their machines.
20:49 < fgleich> we could hire an old retired guy to drive around town all day with an advertising billboard with linux stuff on it
20:50 < fgleich> good idea nicq
20:50 < fgleich> nick125: good idea
20:50 < fgleich> by partnering, what do you mean exactly ?
20:50 < genfool> fgleich,  you are hired, will you work for peanuts?
20:51 < fgleich> I can't eat peanuts, but anything with sugar........
20:51 < fgleich> oh and coffee
20:51 < nick125> fgleich: By partnering, I mean that we'll supply them with expertise, installation media, advertising, etc while they offer their customers Ubuntu machines.
20:51 < fgleich> you could have a sign on the billboard...'FREE LINUX CD'S'
20:52 < fgleich> "ASK ME FOR A FREE LINUX CD"
20:52 < fgleich> ya know, magnetic signs
20:52 < nick125> Interesting idea.
20:52 < fgleich> any kind of advertising would work
20:54 < genfool> steve already does offer that with his shop, I see a conflict with most shops, they make there money with virus removal and malware etc...
20:54 < nick125> It would be interesting for us to distribute CDs locally, maybe by mail, etc.
20:54 < nick125> genfool: True...but I think it's worth a shot.
20:55 < fgleich> I know someone who works for a bulk mailer
20:55 < fgleich> my brother used to do that too
20:55 < genfool> An honest shop will go a lot further than one that just removes crap so it can be re-infected.
20:55 < fgleich> I'll ask about the cost
20:55 < fgleich> it's not cheap
21:00 < fgleich> this meeting over ?
21:01 < genfool> looks like it, I need to eat    see you later fgleich
21:01 < fgleich> later genfool
