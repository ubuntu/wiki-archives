Hi !

17 June 2009
I am Nandan Vaidya, currently a student in Pune, India pursuing my Masters in Science in Computer Applications.
I am a very recent convert to GNU/Linux and I started using Ubuntu in April 2008.

Wish to contribute to Ubuntu in some way, will try and learn Packaging since it seems the most interesting to me.

More later

Thank you.
