=== My relationship with Ubuntu ===

==== Discovering Ubuntu and the free world ====

I first used Ubuntu in October 2008 while working on my university project and mentor suggest me to test the project using some other Linux based distribution as I am introduced to Linux systems using Fedora initially. Until then I was an user to only Redhat and fedora .

I am also a member of Data Security Council Of India , Kolkata Chapter ( A NASSCOM Initiative ) as well as <nowiki>[[https://isoc.org|Member of Internet Society ( Member ID: 203180 )]]</nowiki> etc ..
