__TOC__

The monthly Rochester area New York State LoCo meetup was a success. A total of twelve people showed up for the event and a good time was had by all. Two participants got their CACert assurance completed and other members completed a PGP key signing. There were several mini-conversations including a conversation about offering classes to the local community and hosting open source demonstrations.
