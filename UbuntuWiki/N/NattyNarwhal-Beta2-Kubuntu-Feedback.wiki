== Feedback ==
* The upgrade from 10.10 to 11.04 Beta2 was nearly flawless. The only minor problem was a notification that plasma-desktop had crashed, but everything worked despite that 'crash'. The desktop looks and feels noticeably faster. Well done!
* Flash is broken in Konqueror and Rekonq. I see either nothing or a black rectangle. In Firefox it work at least kind of, although with painting problems. This is on 64bit.@``SIG@
