'''Proceedings'''

Meeting started promptly at 9:00pm by kelms with a hearty "hi there"

Meeting ended at 9:38pm

'''Topics Discussed'''

Talked a little about the different ways one can get on IRC smart phones, IPADS, and the such.

Some talk about STEAM and Desura.

Mainly the discussion focused on getting together for a face-to-face in January, we decided to have a second meeting in December to hopefully rally the tropes and get an idea of how many more would be interested in a face-to-face. It's look like that would be a meeting at the Flying Star on the West side of Albuquerque at Alameda.

And because I promised "We are on a goose".
