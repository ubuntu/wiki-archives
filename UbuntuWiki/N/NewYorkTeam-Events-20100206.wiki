=== Recap ===
This event was a follow-up to the data recovery presentation given Thursday night by NY State Ubuntu LoCo member cprofitt. Several of the participants today got to experience hands on recovering data from disks with the following issues:

* no partitions
* a partition over the top of existing data
* a partition not recognized by the OS

The drives were all attached via a USB 2.0 to IDE/SATA adapter and a mix of images were used to put information on the drives. In addition an old dead drive was disassembled and the parts shown to attendees.

One person also showed up asking to have Ubuntu installed on his laptop. We were able to get Ubuntu and VirtualBox installed on the laptop.
