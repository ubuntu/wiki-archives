=== Future Goals ===

Canonical's focus on its mobile operating system (Ubuntu Touch) has opened up many new opportunities for app developers. I have a few ideas for new applications, some of which are still in the planning stages while others are partially complete. Snappy is something I also hope to play around with in the near future.

I am, of course, planning to continue my focus on developing NitroShare on the desktop.

=== Testimonials ===

'''Note:''' If you have anything nice to say about me, please do add it below along with @ SIG @ (no spaces).  The @ SIG @ command will sign your name and date/time it after you "Save Changes".

Nathan is not just a good developer: he's an ''excellent'' developer: he makes something that just works out-of-the-box and then keeps on pounding it until it's the fastest and most efficient thing around... -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:fabrizio-marana]]</nowiki> 
Nathan is an amazing guy. Whether he is writing awesome software (NitroShare, StackApplet), helping people in Ask Ubuntu chat, or posting on the main site, Nathan has done an outstanding job helping build Ask Ubuntu, its community, and by extension the greater Ubuntu community. I cannot imagine what AU would be today without him. I highly recommend Nathan for membership! - -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:sethj]]</nowiki> 
Nathan was patient/responsive/helpful to Qt questions in AU chat when I was working to learn some PyQt. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:aking1012-com]]</nowiki> 
Nathan is an excellent person, and a great developer. He has helped out quite often, helping people in Ask Ubuntu, and has contributed quite a bit, whether it's through creating excellent software like NitroShare or StackApplet, or contributing to the community to make Ubuntu better, he has definitely made a substantial impact and contribution on the Ubuntu community.  I wholeheartedly recommend him for Ubuntu membership, 100%. - -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:teward]]</nowiki> 
As one of the Ask Ubuntu moderators, I have had the privilege of working with Nathan multiple times over the years, and he has repeatedly proven himself to be someone who is kind, helpful, and very knowledgable on a great many things. If he doesn't know the answer, he also is not afraid to say "I don't know". I highly recommend Nathan for Ubuntu membership. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:jamesgifford]]</nowiki> 
I would say that Nathan has been a mentor and teacher to me.(I first knew him as GeorgeEdison on Ask Ubuntu, and realized we both had stuffed penguins) He is patient, explains things, links to documentation. Then there is also the work he does on building/maintaining the 2buntu blog, I'm inspired as I always see him working on awesome stuff. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:mateo-salta]]</nowiki> 

Nathan gets involved. He helped set up Ask Ubuntu (now a thriving community in itself) and since then he's started a broad spectrum of projects with a singular aim: helping people. Any community would want him in their ranks; Ubuntu will be better for his membership. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:oli]]</nowiki>
