<doomcat> +1
* beanie77 (n=pra@97-123-160-46.albq.qwest.net) has joined #ubuntu-us-nm
<nick125> +1
<doomcat> just in time
<beanie77> Hi All
<gcleric> +1
<tritium> Good evening.
<gcleric> howdy beanie77!
<gcleric> aloha tritium!
<tritium> Hi, gcleric :)
<dthomasdigital> protonchris around?
<tritium> No, he hasn't responded to my ping yet.
<tritium> I will give a quick update on item 1.  Per http://fridge.ubuntu.com/node/1886, I placed an order for official copies of both books for us.  I have already received confirmation that the order has been placed.
<dthomasdigital> well the 1st item belongs to tritium
<dthomasdigital> very cool
<tritium> I have a PDF flyer that they'd like me to share with the group, detailing special editions of the books, with CDs or DVDs inside, available at Barnes and Noble.  I will post a link on our website as soon as protonchris can fix it.  ;)
* jimrz (n=jriordan@c-68-54-8-56.hsd1.nm.comcast.net) has joined #ubuntu-us-nm
<jimrz> good evening everyone, sorry I'm late
<gcleric> hey jimrz
<tritium> I can also sign the group up for a program to get 35% discount on books in the future.
<dthomasdigital> Very nice that they did that
<doomcat> jimrz your fashionably late
<dthomasdigital> I always like getting perks
<tritium> So, anyone that wants to borrow either the official Ubuntu book, or the official Ubuntu Server book, please let me know.  I should be receiving them shortly.
<jimrz> great thanks tritium
<tritium> No problem!
<dthomasdigital> I wonder if we could create some kind of library?
<nick125> dthomasdigital: That would be neat, but where would we keep it?
<dthomasdigital> I certainly have some books to donate...EPC comes to mind
<jimrz> dthomasdigital: was thinking the same thing
* ColonelPanik  votes yes!
<doomcat> that sounds great
<dthomasdigital> But that's something we can bring up at a later date
<dthomasdigital> I'm sure that will be a pretty good size project.
<dthomasdigital> item #2 we kind of need protonchris
<nick125> Let's postpone that until protonchris appears.
<jimrz> +1
<gcleric> +1
<doomcat> +1
<nick125> Otherwise, I think we might be waiting here a while.
<dthomasdigital> +1
<jimrz> <grin>
<dthomasdigital> SFD fast approaches
<jimrz> si
<ColonelPanik> RLY?
<nick125> ColonelPanik: RLY RLY
<dthomasdigital> The people from Cottonwood Mall have till tomorrow to get back to me
<nick125> before dthomasdigital breaks out the katanas
* doomcat laughs
<dthomasdigital> cost of "liability insurance" and time will be known then
<gcleric> dthomasdigital: is there an issue?
<dthomasdigital> the cost will be between 90 and 130 bucks
<dthomasdigital> gcleric no issues those people just move slow
<gcleric> dthomasdigital: cattle prod?
<dthomasdigital> We might have to do it under NMLC if that is OK with the group, and the NMLC board
<nick125> What would be the benefits of that?
<gcleric> +1
<dthomasdigital> +1
<jimrz> +1
<doomcat> +1
* nick125 isn't questioning the idea...just curious
<dthomasdigital> high traffic area to hand out massive amount of media
<tritium> What does the liability insurance cover?
<dthomasdigital> If someone trips on a cord, table falls on them we are covered standard policy
<nick125> ...of course, let's hope that doesn't happen.
<dthomasdigital> Also if we do it under NMLC the incorporation gives us protection too
<jimrz> that, too
<tritium> That sounds best.
<dthomasdigital> funny protection to hand out disc
<nick125> Are we going to have any displays?
<nick125> i.e., maybe a few demo videos running or something?
<gcleric> dthomasdigital: everyone want's their cut...
<dthomasdigital> I building them as I type
<dthomasdigital> Well I'm good for 20.00
<tritium> nick125: that would be smart.  A laptop showing off some eye candy might be wise.
<nick125> Play some open source music, etc.
<dthomasdigital> SFD 2007 https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Software_Freedom_Day%3A_September_15%2C_2007
* jimrz also good for $'s
* nick125 would give $, but he doesn't have much
<tritium> I can contribute too.
<jimrz> nick125: no worries
<dthomasdigital> You can use the donate button on the NMGLF site http://www.newmexicognulinuxfest.org/?q=node/11 button is on the bottom, just email me once you donate and let me know it's for SFD
<gcleric> I'll contribute...just spending $$$ on tiling my house...
<dthomasdigital> gcleric I saw your hands, tough work man.
<nick125> dthomasdigital: What time do you think SFD will be at? earlier than say...7am?
<gcleric> did another 110sqft list weekend...
<nick125> Oh what the heck, I'll just sign up. I'm not doing anything that day.
<dthomasdigital> I'd mid-morning, 
<dthomasdigital> that's the spirit

<ColonelPanik> You all are doing good on SFD, all I have for help is one Mandriva user!
<ColonelPanik> a psychologist
<dthomasdigital> I should have plenty of Ubuntu disk to send some SFD ballons and stickers too.
<ColonelPanik> Any Fedora?
<dthomasdigital> fedora is sending plenty of liveCD and DVD should have those too
<tritium> dthomasdigital: I gave you nearly all the 9.04 CDs we got.  That should go a long way.
<ColonelPanik> Wow, great
<gcleric> I still have a few CDs left too.
<dthomasdigital> tritium yes, and the SFD people are sending more too we should be well covered for us and ColonelPanik's event

<gcleric> if not I guess we are done.
<ColonelPanik> Now I have the pleasure of calling "helios"  the infamous Ken Starks in Austin TX
<nick125> ColonelPanik: What for?
<dthomasdigital> See you all I'm off to bed after some much needed documentation.
<nick125> night
<ColonelPanik> Pick his brain on how to put on a Linux event
<gcleric> ColonelPanik: Helios of the famous School/linux issue?
<clayjar> I'm a newcomer to ABQ, recently from Chicago, so I'm reading the websites right now... looks like the most active F/OSS group around here.
<nick125> clayjar: We take most pride in being the most active group around here! :P
<ColonelPanik> And just cause he is a cool guy.  gcleric:  Yes
<gcleric> clayjar: we welcome to the ABQ... just in time for the chili roasting too.. .
<dthomasdigital> clayjar NMGLUG in Santa Fe is a fine group too
* nick125 gets the marshmellows
<ColonelPanik> clayjar, No, all the action is in Portales, I have several meetings everyday.
<dthomasdigital> Also folks at MVLUG down to the south are nice group too
<clayjar> I was looking for a generic Linux group at first, but I think this group is the only one that seems to be active.
<dthomasdigital> We all worry about ColonelPanik......but it's a good kind of worry.
<gcleric> clayjar: if you are not busy Sat morning stop by EPC and meet some of the group..
<gcleric> EPC's address is  509 Cardenas Dr. SE
<ColonelPanik> Portales is the Linux capitol of the Universe or even the multi-verse
<clayjar> Thanks for the invite! :)  I'd probably drop by to say hello and share my spare parts, too. I don't think I can stay too long, though.
* nick125 doinks ColonelPanik 
<dthomasdigital> clyjar I'm an Ubuntu member, fedora Ambassador, and OpenSUSE Ambassador so these Ubuntu LoCo folks are a pretty open bunch
<gcleric> clayjar: very cool...
<ColonelPanik> dthomasdigital, What?  No Mandriva?
<nick125> clayjar: This brings up the question....what distro ARE you using? ;)
<dthomasdigital> clayjar oh and I can't spell and and these guys make me document everything
<clayjar> My love/neglect relationship with linux goes all the way back to the first version of slackware... I'm either using Ubuntu or Fedora mostly for LAMP setups these days...
<gcleric> clayjar: mine too.
<dthomasdigital> ColonelPanik when you going to send me that guys contact.
<ColonelPanik> helios?
<dthomasdigital> Have slackware on a laptop I can;t give up my first love too
<ColonelPanik> or my Mandriva guy?
<clayjar> dthomasdigital, cool, glad to meet an evangelist.
<clayjar> dthomasdigital, same here... although my laptop boots into fedora as well...
<dthomasdigital> evangelist is a good title for me I'm a true believer now to get my wife off windows that would be a real miracle.
<clayjar> lol
<dthomasdigital> darn photographers and their photoshop
<clayjar> I wonder how well ReactOS works with Photoshop...
<ColonelPanik> dthomasdigital, Those mixed marriages don't work
<clayjar> I know Photoshop 3 is in one of their screenshots.
<clayjar> Anyway, Wine probably doesn't like Photoshop for now..
<dthomasdigital> CS 2 will work but not CS4
<dthomasdigital> Ready to call the meeting, I got to get to bed
