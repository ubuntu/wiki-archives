Tester's comment: Telling update-manager to look for normal instead of LTS allows it to see Maverick. However, still a failure because Metacity is broken and the desktop is quite unstable and unusable after opening a single large app (like firefox or OO.o)

1: The post-upgrade test item: "Open the Example Documents and play the "Experience ubuntu.ogg" and see if that playing works" Needs to be changed. The current example content does not contain this (looked in /usr/share/example-content)

2: ubuntu desktop is glitchy.
