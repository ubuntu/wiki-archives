__TOC__

Essentially I would like to have the website being able to replace
add/remove just by using apt:$packagename uris. The way I think it
could work would be to have something like

http://apps.ubuntu.com/hardy

That would then display a search bar and a nice web page that shows a
overview based on the categories of the packages (Education, Games,
Graphics, ...). The data is all available in the app-install-data
package. When the user clicks on a category, he sees the individual
applications with sort options (popularity, alphabetic). So essentially
how gnome-app-install works now. If he clicks on the details, there is
the usual description/icon.

In addition to the stuff that g-a-i already offers I would like to add:
* screenshots (a lot of them can be auto-generated I think -  I have some code for this. Screenshot uploads by trusted members would be cool.)
* comments (with the ability to remove them again)
* ratings (a new rating in addition to the popcon stuff we use now)

Revelant UB idea:

Existing examples:
* http://linuxmint.com/software/?sec=categories&release=3
* http://www.gnomefiles.org/
* http://online.gnome.org/applications

* http://en.opensuse.org/Standards/One_Click_Install

Notes:
* Just applications, not libraries.
* Initially, just for officially-packaged applications.
* Desktop files already have meta-data.
* The Ubuntu Brainstorm website has some similar functionality already (users, comments, categories, rating). Reuse?
* Auto-detect OS/distro
* having independent voting for openoffice/hardy and openoffice/dapper
* Launchpad's XML-RPC API can (or could soon) provide a list of applications, plus application details. Ask in #launchpad - Elliot Murphy (statik) or Leonard Richardson (leonardr).But app-install-data maybe has all that's needed already.
* Allow users to improve application descriptions and translate them (even into English).This could also be in Launchpad (there is a rosetta spec for this at: https://blueprints.edge.launchpad.net/rosetta/+spec/native-package-descriptions-support)
* Guidelines on how to write useful package descriptions. [one that exists: http://people.debian.org/~walters/descriptions.html]
* Provide screenshots (but make clear what the copyright license for these will be).
