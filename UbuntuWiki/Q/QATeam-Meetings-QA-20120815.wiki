 14:04:18 <smartboyhw> #topic Ubuntu Updates

 14:04:43 <smartboyhw> O

 14:04:45 <smartboyhw> OK

 14:04:53 <smartboyhw> So, Ubuntu 12.04.1 is coming next week

 14:05:12 <smartboyhw> So the testing will be more intense in the coming week

 14:05:38 <smartboyhw> Um...

 14:05:52 <smartboyhw> Hopefully we will get to test all flavors...

 14:05:53 <smartboyhw> ..

 14:05:58 <smartboyhw> balloons: Any updates?

 14:07:04 <balloons> 12.04.1 images will be landing at the beginning of next week, and we'll have our usual round of testing on the images

 14:07:22 <balloons> these will be an lt supdate, so it's really important to watch for regressions.

 14:08:17 <balloons> we don't anticipate respins; aiming for a smooth round of testing :-)

 14:08:17 <balloons> ..

 14:08:21 <smartboyhw> Hmm

 14:08:49 <smartboyhw> balloons: Last time phillw deleted the flavor updates

 14:08:59 <smartboyhw> Is it that we shall never talk about it again?

 14:09:17 <balloons> they've been migrated in the agenda to other updates

 14:09:25 <balloons> use the [TOPIC] so people can follow along :-)

 14:09:29 <smartboyhw> OK

 14:09:34 <smartboyhw> [TOPIC] Ubuntu updates

 14:09:40 <smartboyhw> Yep, then

 14:09:54 <smartboyhw> An agenda item added by phillw: Abiword

 14:10:00 <smartboyhw> [TOPIC] Abiword

 14:10:22 <smartboyhw> balloons: i'm wondering what's that

 14:11:18 <smartboyhw> Someone added AbiWord to the agenda

 14:11:22 <smartboyhw> Is phillw here?

 14:11:30 <balloons> smartboyhw, there is a concern about the stability of abiword in the 12.04 repos

 14:11:38 <balloons> there is a bug opened to this effect, let me find it

 14:11:43 <smartboyhw> balloons: What's abiword

 14:12:18 <balloons> here is the bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/abiword/+bug/1019621

 14:12:19 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1019621 in abiword (Ubuntu) "Precise abiword version needs to be reverted to stable release prior to 12.04.1" [Undecided,Confirmed]

 14:12:24 <balloons> abiword is a word processor

 14:12:42 <smartboyhw> OK

 14:13:12 <smartboyhw> Hmm, big bug

 14:13:53 <smartboyhw> ..

 14:14:36 <smartboyhw> balloons: ..?

 14:14:57 <balloons> yes smartboyhw ?

 14:15:26 <balloons> phillw, and lubuntu and presumbably xubuntu flavors are all concerned about this bug

 14:15:32 <smartboyhw> Wow1

 14:15:37 <smartboyhw> Maybe even Ubuntu Studio

 14:15:55 <balloons> likely it will have to be fixed by an update after 12.04.1

 14:16:01 <smartboyhw> OK

 14:16:06 <smartboyhw> ..

 14:17:11 <balloons> ..

 14:17:23 <smartboyhw> OK, then AOB

 14:17:28 <smartboyhw> [TOPIC] AOB

 14:17:40 <smartboyhw> balloons: How is the survey results?

 14:19:24 <balloons> smartboyhw, I intend to post the full result this week

 14:19:33 <balloons> a little preview I can share some details

 14:19:37 <smartboyhw> OK

 14:19:42 <smartboyhw> Please, balloons

 14:20:34 <balloons> the folks answering the survey we about 50/50 split on running the development release

 14:20:53 <smartboyhw> 50/50? I hoped 70/30

 14:21:14 <balloons> the largest number of votes on "what quality means" was "Quality means the default desktop and applications should work without crashing"

 14:21:45 <balloons> Finally, many many folks had never heard of the team before, but most people expressed interest in helping, but they were unsure of time and technical skills

 14:21:46 <smartboyhw> yep, I voted for that:)

 14:22:07 <smartboyhw> balloons: Not good. Nobody heard of the team?:(

 14:22:21 <balloons> good feedback, and as a group we can discuss ways to bring more awareness to the team and share what we're doing with others

 14:22:39 <smartboyhw> balloons: So how do you promote the team?

 14:22:47 <smartboyhw> I mean planning:)

 14:24:11 <smartboyhw> balloons: I mean how will you plan to promote the team.

 14:25:33 <balloons> smartboyhw, promoting the team means more visibility to what we are doing

 14:25:47 <smartboyhw> I'm a bit ? about the visibility

 14:25:52 <smartboyhw> How to improve it?

 14:25:59 <xnox> balloons: what survey? =)

 14:26:18 <balloons> xnox, sorry we should have linked ;-)

 14:26:45 <balloons> http://www.theorangenotebook.com/2012/08/quality-perceptions-survey.html

 14:29:05 <balloons> xnox,  the survey is now over, and I'll be posting the results. It was anonymous, however, if you have thoughts to share, feel free to do so

 14:29:33 <xnox> well wanted to see questions really. oh well. I will wait for the results blog =)

 14:29:52 <balloons> smartboyhw, promoting the team means sharing details on the work and planning events and ways to involve people. this is something everyone can do

 14:29:57 <balloons> xnox, :-)

 14:30:18 <smartboyhw> balloons: Great

 14:30:33 <smartboyhw> balloons: I have been failing to contact phillw about our UEFI testcase

 14:30:46 <smartboyhw> He is busy when I'm not, I'm busy whe he i

 14:30:48 <smartboyhw> *is

 14:31:35 <smartboyhw> ..

 14:32:35 <smartboyhw> Also, balloons, I saw some Mythbuntu testcase missing, wat to do?

 14:32:58 <balloons> smartboyhw, we can discuss outside of the meeting. Are there additional topics to cover?

 14:33:34 <smartboyhw> No, then, so end meeting?

 14:33:58 <balloons> Normally the final item on the agenda is [OTHER TOPICS]

 14:34:17 <smartboyhw> It's now AOB, don't you realize

 14:34:22 <smartboyhw> Any other business

 14:35:08 <balloons> ahh!

 14:35:11 <smartboyhw> So what other business can we discuss?

 14:35:17 <balloons> smartboyhw, I have nothing else

 14:35:42 <smartboyhw> Really, this meeting has too few people

 14:35:46 <leadsled> abiword versions

 14:35:51 <smartboyhw> Hi leadsled

 14:35:55 <smartboyhw> #topic Abiword

 14:36:27 <smartboyhw> leadsled: What things do ya want to say about AbiWord?

 14:37:32 <smartboyhw> leadsled: o/ if you want to say something about AbiWord

 14:37:56 <leadsled> which version will be used before the freeze?

 14:38:11 <smartboyhw> balloons: Your turn, I don't know much about Abiword

 14:39:08 <balloons> I can't speak for the 12.04.1 team, however at this point I believe changing the version would need to be a post-release work

 14:40:11 <ScottK> Nothing new now for 12.04.1 that isn't an absolute show stopper with a clear fix that has very low risk of regression.

 14:40:35 <smartboyhw> Thanks, ScottK

 14:41:30 <smartboyhw> Anyway, we don't know, ask the 12.04.1 team tmr

 14:41:31 <smartboyhw> ..

 14:42:54 <smartboyhw> End meeting now, since it's been discussed.
