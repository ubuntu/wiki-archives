Tester's comment: Testing is done in Oracle VirtualBox and physical computers.

Details of the encoutered bugs are on launchpad.

I tested it on a IBM T23 laptop and it told me that Unity couldn&#039;t run on it. I tried then to run the classic session. It didn&#039;t run in the classic mode either.

Testing the daily for Feb 3rd also had a serious problem. It stalled during bootup. I was able to get an error code.
