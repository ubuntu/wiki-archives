__TOC__

The QuickTour is the respeced Quickguide.

=== Spec ===

The point of this doc is to highlight what makes Ubuntu cool, fun and useful and also to point out what makes Breezy cool, useful and fun (over Hoary). The target audience is conferences, the upcoming Fridge and any event that needs bite-sized marketing stuff.

Language should be short, light and to-the-point. Each section is about 20 words long, with an appropriate screenshot. The screenshot must be in the default Ubuntu theme, with the default Ubuntu background, if visible.

=== Viewing the doc ===

The doc is now in the UbuntuDocumentationTeam svn repo, in the quicktour dir in the gnome directory.
