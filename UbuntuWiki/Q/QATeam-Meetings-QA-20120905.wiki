 14:06:51 <smartboyhw> balloons to chase up the incorrect meeting time on qa.ubuntu.com

 14:06:55 <smartboyhw> This one...

 14:07:02 <balloons> smartboyhw, ahh yes

 14:07:13 * balloons goes to look

 14:07:23 <smartboyhw> Also phillw balloons to continue to update Wiki progress update please:)

 14:07:45 <smartboyhw> Not yet edited balloons, the time:(

 14:08:01 <phillw> smartboyhw: work continues, the bug section has been tidyed up.

 14:08:06 <smartboyhw> OK

 14:08:12 <smartboyhw> Thanks phillw

 14:08:23 <balloons> smartboyhw, no status update on qa.ubuntu.com sadly

 14:08:30 <smartboyhw> ...

 14:08:40 <balloons> [TOPIC] Ubuntu Updates

 14:08:54 <balloons> Ok, as everyone knows it's beta 1 time

 14:09:50 <balloons> The biggest news for this milestone is the dropping of alternate images for ubuntu

 14:10:06 <smartboyhw> +1

 14:10:48 <balloons> For the sake of the chat, I will supply the link to the discussion

 14:11:10 <balloons> https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2012-August/035675.html

 14:11:18 <balloons> any further discussion on the change?

 14:11:59 <smartboyhw> No!

 14:12:34 <balloons> Alright, the beta testing itself is going well, although we've had some respins during the testing

 14:12:47 <smartboyhw> Yep so many for Ubuntu Studio due to ubiquity

 14:12:48 <balloons> the images were in quite a state of flux before the milestone

 14:13:02 <balloons> so they are still being ironed out

 14:13:59 <balloons> [TOPIC] Other topics

 14:14:02 * balloons sighs

 14:14:03 <smartboyhw> \o

 14:14:11 <balloons> go ahead smartboyhw

 14:14:26 <smartboyhw> #link http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2053135

 14:14:41 <smartboyhw> balloons have a look at it, not good

 14:15:27 <smartboyhw> Someone is having negative comments on the ISO QA Tracker

 14:15:41 <smartboyhw> So how can we improve it, or should we ignore their feedback?

 14:15:42 <smartboyhw> ,,

 14:15:43 <smartboyhw> ..

 14:15:49 * smartboyhw sighs

 14:16:13 <balloons> smartboyhw, I saw the thread

 14:16:17 <smartboyhw> :)

 14:16:38 <balloons> we can take the feedback and try and understand what's causing them issues

 14:17:08 <smartboyhw> OK

 14:18:01 <phillw> \o

 14:18:02 <balloons> communication and responsiveness from the development team is an on-going thing.. We'll continue to try and fill in the gap for both sides

 14:18:16 <balloons> thanks smartboyhw.

 14:18:19 <balloons> phillw, go ahead

 14:18:21 <smartboyhw> :)

 14:18:58 <phillw> I'd like to put on record my thanks to stgraber for the work done on the tracker so bugs are carried over when respins occur.

 14:19:17 <phillw> it has long been a thorn in our side.

 14:19:18 <smartboyhw> +1

 14:19:42 <balloons> sure looks nice doesn't it? :-)

 14:19:43 <phillw> lubuntu has two show-stopper bugs :(

 14:20:03 <phillw> bug http://launchpad.net/bugs/1041625

 14:20:04 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1041625 in xserver-xorg-video-openchrome (Ubuntu) "X not starting after install [openchrome]" [High,Triaged]

 14:20:19 <phillw> bug http://launchpad.net/bugs/1040544

 14:20:21 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1040544 in ubiquity (Ubuntu) "Installer dialog does not come up" [Undecided,New]

 14:20:28 <smartboyhw> Alright

 14:20:45 <phillw> both are out of our hands.

 14:21:09 <smartboyhw> Ubuntu Studio builds got a hell lot of respins for the last few days due to ubiquity being unstable. However the new build works fine

 14:21:19 <balloons> phillw, likely will turn into respins?

 14:21:39 <balloons> at least one is an upstream issue

 14:21:41 <phillw> balloons: a respin is better than no release on those two.

 14:22:44 <balloons> of course.. not sure the openchrome will be solved, but it looks like a fix can be had for it

 14:23:10 <balloons> the other one is a dosey.. lars always manages to find those exotic bugs doesn't he?

 14:23:12 <phillw> as it is killing both of the ppc iso's one of them really does need fixing

 14:23:13 <balloons> +1 for lars

 14:23:35 <smartboyhw> +1

 14:23:55 <phillw> he's a good tester :)

 14:23:58 <balloons> :-)

 14:24:02 <balloons> anything else?

 14:24:21 <smartboyhw> No

 14:24:27 <phillw> oh yes, I forgot.

 14:24:41 <smartboyhw> phillw: ?

 14:24:42 <phillw> lubuntu now has an ARM iso (it arrived overnight)

 14:24:55 <phillw> the arm community are looking after it.

 14:24:58 <smartboyhw> Yep, sadly I don't have ARM

 14:25:02 <balloons> phillw, yes, please share the story

 14:25:18 <smartboyhw> :)

 14:25:41 <phillw> I was asked if lubuntu would object to it. Some ARM machines cannot cope with full ubuntu install, so they wanted a light weight vriant

 14:26:04 <phillw> I was on the release channel and

 14:26:12 <phillw> so it seems lubuntu came to mind,

 14:27:14 <phillw> it was a long term goal for lubuntu to have arm, but we lacked resources - these have now been provided by the arm community.

 14:27:20 <phillw> ..

 14:27:27 <balloons> thanks phillw

 14:27:30 <smartboyhw> \o

 14:27:40 <balloons> I think it's exciting, and glad to see if all coming together so quick

 14:27:49 <balloons> smartboyhw, go ahead

 14:28:01 <smartboyhw> Er, wait while I give the links

 14:28:23 <smartboyhw> #link http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2052509

 14:28:56 <smartboyhw> It is said that there will be a Ubuntu GNOME remix coming

 14:29:12 <smartboyhw> And trying to get approval to become a official Ubuntu distro

 14:29:12 <phillw> Gubuntu?

 14:29:20 <smartboyhw> phillw: Possibly GNOMEbuntu

 14:29:56 <smartboyhw> So any comments on that?

 14:30:28 <phillw> i don't use gnome, so none from me.

 14:30:35 <smartboyhw> OK.

 14:30:46 <balloons> smartboyhw, it's always exciting to see new ideas come to life.. I wish the flavor the best

 14:31:19 <smartboyhw> OK

 14:32:07 <balloons> anything further?

 14:32:12 <smartboyhw> ..

 14:32:14 <smartboyhw> No

 14:32:18 <balloons> if not this meeting's a wrap :-)

 14:32:21 <smartboyhw> ;-)
