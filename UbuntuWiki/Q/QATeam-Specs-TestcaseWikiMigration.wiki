=== Summary ===

Migrating all test cases to testcases.qa.ubuntu.com, adding useful macros and making sure all relevant teams are using the new facility.

=== Rationale ===

We need a consistent syntax to define the test cases and a better way to track them. Right now, test cases are maintained under https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/Cases but the syntax is not defined and there is no logical way to track what it is available.

=== Use Cases ===

* Mark, a netbook-remix user, wants to add a new test case for an application that already has a test case for Ubuntu desktop. He calls the already available test case from the UNR page, needing only to upload the netbook-remix specific screenshots.
* Anne, a Kubuntu user, finds a bug in Kpdf while reading a complex PDF file. She creates a LP bug but also creates a new test case to track future regressions. This file will be added also as test case for Evince in Ubuntu.
* Chris wishes to track the testing for a mobile build. He can do that in the wiki by using a macro

=== Design ===

==== Testcases Syntax ====

A standard test case template will be drawn up which will be used by all test cases. <nowiki>[[ApplicationTemplate|Application Template]]</nowiki>
The syntax will not be automatically checked, at this point it is enough to follow the template and reedit them manually if errors are found.

===== Metadata =====

** Distro(s) - for which distro flavours is the case valid? 
** Version(s) - for which distro versions is the case valid? 
** Application name
** Attachments required for the test case should be stored in the wiki and linked explicitly

==== Testcase Number ====

After much discussion it has been agreed that we will use the following syntax to track the test cases number as:
* If it is a test case for an application, then the testcase number will be [a-z]{2}-[0-9]{3} (2 letters for the application and 3 numbers for the test case number)
* If it is a test case for a Launchpad bug then the testcase number will be lp-[bugnumber] 

The testcase number will be checked for syntax and a warning will be raised in these cases:
* No track number has been added
* The track number is already used by other testcase.

==== Path Structure ====

We have decided to move the pages from <code>/Distribution/Applications</code> to just <code>/Applications</code>. For example, the Ekiga page will be at <code>http://testcases.qa.ubuntu.com/Applications/Ekiga</code> instead of <code>http://testcases.qa.ubuntu.com/Ubuntu/Applications/Ekiga</code>.

A Moin Moin plugin will be needed to change to the proper screenshots when called with /Ubuntu, /Kubuntu, /Xubuntu, etc.

The testcases from pulled from launchpad bugs exists under http://testcases.qa.ubuntu.com/Regressions/ with per-data type subtrees, but is open to renaming or restructuring.

==== Tracking results ====

A test tracking facility in a separate page tree but in the same wiki will make it easy to track test results linked to the cases.

* Use a standard page space such as <code>/TestRuns/<identifier></code> to collect results
* Write a macro to list the tests used (and optionally display the full case text) and collect the results through simple input boxes

=== Implementation ===

 '''Admin:''' A new LP project needs to be created to track bugs and code for the custom changes (plugins, themes and macros).

* '''Displaying case numbers''' - A ''Macro'' for collecting and displaying case numbers and titles in table form
* '''Test results''' - A '''Macro''' based on <nowiki>[[http://moinmo.in/MacroMarket/PageComment2|PageComment2]]</nowiki> to display case information with result entry boxes and result tables. The actual results are stored in a sub-page (as the comment macro does).

==== Migration ====

* After migration all the old test cases wiki pages need to have just an advice pointing to the new test cases wiki.
