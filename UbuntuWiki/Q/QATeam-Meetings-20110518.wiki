=== Any Other Business ===
Question from brendand: i'd like to do some stuff for QA in my spare time. what's the best place to put my efforts? 

* you can help with bug triage if there are some package you know particularly well,
* SRU testing is also a great place to start and where we need more testing.
* for each milestone, you can help with ISO testing (arm, powerpc and amd+mac welcome)
* and you can help with automation and application testing.

You can join us on #ubuntu-bugs for bug triaging and #ubuntu-testing for ... testing

 <''''''> Any question ?

 <''''''> Good, next topic

 <''''''> [TOPIC] Any Other Business

=== Any Other Business ===
 <''''''> anyone?

 <''''''> o/

 <''''''> brendand, go ahead, you've been waiting for this moment all day ;-)

 <''''''> i'd like to do some stuff for QA in my spare time. what's the best place to put my efforts?

 <''''''> i'm guessing i could verify a few of those SRU's

 <''''''> anything else?

 <''''''> brendand, what's your best place of interest in QA ?

 <''''''> usually writing automated test cases

 <''''''> i can do anything though

 <''''''> jibel, brendand: I think this conversation should be taken outside of this meeting

 <''''''> people are waiting to get back to work :)

 <''''''> brendand, if you like bugs, step by #ubuntu-bugs and we'd be glad to help you with that :-)

 <''''''> brendand, there are a few pointer on this page https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QATeam/

 <''''''> and on http://qa.ubuntu.com/

 <''''''> you can help with bug triage if there are some package you know particularly well,

 <''''''> ok. thanks

 <''''''> SRU testing is also a great place to start and where we need more testing.

 <''''''> for each milestone, you can help with ISO testing (arm, powerpc and amd+mac welcome)

 <''''''> and you can help with automation and application testing.

 <''''''> You can join us on #ubuntu-bugs for bug triaging and #ubuntu-testing for ... testing

 <''''''> brendand, does it answer your question ?

 <''''''> jibel - very much so

 <''''''> brendand, great!

 <''''''> anyone else ?

 <''''''> [TOPIC] Moving the meeting to #ubuntu-meeting -- bdmurray

=== Moving the meeting to #ubuntu-meeting -- bdmurray ===
 <''''''> bdmurray, the floor is yours

 <''''''> bdmurray, already moved to #u-meeting ?

 <''''''> bdmurray: is still lurking, profoundly so ;-)

 <''''''> ok, topic postponed to next meeting.

 <''''''> but yes, it has already moved to -meeting

 <''''''> hey now

 <''''''> hey bdmurray welcome back

 <''''''> I just thought moving the QA team meeting to ubuntu-meeting might make more sense

 <''''''> bdmurray, right, is there a slot available same day same time ?

 <''''''> double checking

 <''''''> not at 1800 UTC but at 1700 there is

 <''''''> however the meeting scheduled for right now doesn't seem to be happening in #ubuntu-meeting

 <''''''> do you want to vote for moving to #u-meeting at 1700UTC ?

 <''''''> sounds like a good idea to me

 <''''''> I think it is a good idea, if there is a slot available

 <''''''> +1

 <''''''> are we no longer going to rotate the time each week? meaning 1700 each week?

 <''''''> it'd make things less confusing

 <''''''> agreed

 <''''''> yeah. I was never sure of when -- mostly given the conflicting invites ;-)

 <''''''> my calendar is going to appreciate that :-)

 <''''''> add DST + google calendar and you're definitely lost.

 <''''''> accepted then, I'll send the announcement to ubuntu-qa.

 <''''''> yeah, the gargle canlendar has some issues there
