'''THE DATES IN THE SCHEDULE WERE TAKEN FROM THE IntrepidReleaseSchedule'''

* ''Please do not edit''
* Freezes normally happen at the start of the given date, UTC time.  So last minute changes need to happen the day before.
* Some background information and Q&A about the Ubuntu release process can be found on TimeBasedReleases
* Compare with <nowiki>[[http://live.gnome.org/TwoPointTwentythree|GNOME release schedule]]</nowiki>
* See the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/OtherProjectSchedules|Schedules of other projects]]</nowiki>
* There are a wide variety of areas to focus on to ensure quality in the Ubuntu distribution.  The '''QA Focus''' indicates where our efforts should be focused in descending order.

=== Focus explanation ===

* SRU (Stable Release Update) Verification - the process of installing packages from the -proposed repository for a release and testing to ensure that it fixes the SRU bug and has no regressions
* Forwarding bugs - sending bug reports to upstream, developers of the software, bug trackers to ensure the bug has the greatest number of developers working on it
* Solicit kernel testing - due to the large volume and possibility of regressions for kernel bugs not every bug may get fixed.  Subsequently, we solicit testing of milestones for unfixed hardware specific kernel bugs.
* intrepid-qa bug lists - these are created by the Canonical QA team for subteams (platform, desktop, server) of the distribution team
* ISO testing - testing of the daily builds leading up to a milestone
* Finish string-fix bugs - any outstanding string-fix bug reports should be fixed before the '''DocumentationStringFreeze'''
* Test case review - review of the ISO test cases after User Interface freeze for upcoming ISO testing
* Triage of Intrepid bugs - 'nuff said!
