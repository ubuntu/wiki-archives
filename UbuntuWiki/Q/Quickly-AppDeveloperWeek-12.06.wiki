'''Here are notes for the "Getting started with Quickly" Ubuntu App Developer Week talk on 2012-06-18.'''

== Intro ==
=== What is Quickly? ===
* A way to get up and running quickly
* Boiler plate
* Opinionated choices
* Package an app for users
* Easy and fun

=== Quickly in Ubuntu 12.04 ===
* Version 12.04
* Three templates: ubuntu-application, ubuntu-cli, ubuntu-flash-game
* GTK+ 3 and Python 2 based

=== Installing Quickly ===
* $ sudo apt-get install quickly
* Lots of dependencies, so a slightly large download
* Sets up lots of useful tools

== Creating your app ==
* $ quickly create ubuntu-application app-name
* Creates and opens a working application
* $ cd app-name

== Tutorial ==
* $ quickly tutorial
* Runs you through some sample modifications and commands, but just note it for later.  We'll move on

== Editing the UI ==
* $ quickly design
* Code files and glade files linked by naming
* Automatically hooked up for you

=== Glade Tips and Tricks ===
* Selecting in the inspector
* Layout via Boxes
* Changing position in a Box
* pack_start, pack_end
* Fill and expand control sizing, auto layout on window resizing
* Border and padding control spacing 
* Use stock items when possible
* Translator comments

== Editing the Code ==
* $ quickly edit
* Code files opened in gedit

=== Testing changes ===
* $ quickly run
* Runs your project, with all your changes

=== Saving changes ===
* $ quickly save [comment]
* Uses bzr to save a checkpoint.  Use actual bzr for anything fancier, like reverting.

=== Dialogs ===
* Add dialogs with the "dialog" command
** $ quickly add dialog dialog-name
** Close, reopen Glade
** Import the dialog
<pre>
from project_name.DialogName import DialogName
</pre>
** Use <code>DialogName()</code>
<pre>
d = DialogName()
response = d.run()
if response == gtk.RESPONSE_OK:
# do your stuff
d.destroy()
</pre>

=== Signals ===
* In Glade, note widget name
* For buttons, use clicked
* For menus, use activated
* Writing signal handlers:
<pre>
def on_button1_clicked(self, widget, data=None):
### do your stuff
### widget is the sender
</pre>

== Writing Code ==
* <code>finish_initializing()</code> versus <code>__init__()</code>
* Your entry point is ProjectWindow, project_lib is subject to change

== Debugging and Testing ==
=== Print statements ===
* Most common and easiest
* Leaves print statements in code, need to be deleted

=== Logging ===
* <code>logging.debug('things are working')</code>
* Won't cause debug output to be printed in normal run

== Packaging ==
* For sharing apps via email or dropping a file somewhere
* Quite forgiving

=== Setting up your app for packaging ===
* Add your name and email to the AUTHORS file
* $ quickly license BSD # if needed, GPL-3 by default
* Edit *.desktop.in to define category (http://standards.freedesktop.org/menu-spec/latest/apa.html)
* Add author, email, description, long description to setup.py

=== Creating a deb ===
* $ quickly package
* Try it out

== PPAs ==
* A bit less forgiving than package
* Create SSH keys as per Launchpad instructions (https://help.launchpad.net/YourAccount/CreatingAnSSHKeyPair)
* Create PGP keys as per Launchpad instructions (https://help.launchpad.net/YourAccount/ImportingYourPGPKey)
** set DEBEMAIL and DEBFULLNAME in .bashrc, the same as what was in your GPG key
** match gpg --list-secret-keys
<pre>
export DEBEMAIL="oliver.twist@example.com"
export DEBFULLNAME="Oliver Twist"
</pre>

* Create a PPA (https://help.launchpad.net/Packaging/PPA)
* To release, you need to create a project in Launchpad
* $ quickly share # puts latest in your PPA
* $ quickly release # does the same but also increments version and makes an announcement

== Software Center ==
If you'd like to see your project in the Ubuntu Software Center, then the <code>submitubuntu</code> command will help you out a bit.  It does a few notable things to aid application approval:

* Creates and publishes a package to a PPA just as <code>quickly release</code> does
* The package will have files installed into /opt as required
* The package will have special metadata that is used by the Software Center (like where the screenshot lives and such)

You can create the same special package without actually publishing to a PPA (for testing and your curiosity) by using the <code>package</code> command:

<pre>
$ quickly package --extras
</pre>
