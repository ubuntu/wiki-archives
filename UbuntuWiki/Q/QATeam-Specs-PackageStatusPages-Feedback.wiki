==== Package Requests ====
Currently we are only producing status pages for a subset of packages that have more than 100 bugs.  We're always open to suggestions for adding packages which should be monitored.  Below are the current requested packages to be added:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| Package
| Implemented
|-
| casper
| 
|}

==== More info on the package itself ====
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| Feature
| Implemented
|-
| links to Ubuntu/Debian changelogs
| 
|-
| Ubuntu/Debian versions
| 
|-
| links to package LP page and Debian PTS/BTS pages
| 
|}

==== Feature Requests ====
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| Feature
| Priority
| Implemented
|-
| historical view of data - ie like bryce's page (Needs change to php code)
| <bgcolor=red> HIGH
| 
|-
| individual graphical view of status' (possibly clickable from the graph headers)
| <bgcolor=red> HIGH
| 
|-
| look at upstream report to find packages to add - https://edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+upstreamreport
| <bgcolor=red> HIGH
| <bgcolor=lightgreen> Done - but maybe review again later
|-
| Reword "Most duplicates" to "Bug with most duplicates"
| <bgcolor=red> HIGH
| <bgcolor=lightgreen> Done
|-
| bug info for upstream should include a bugs fixed upstream number and link
| <bgcolor=red> HIGH
| <bgcolor=lightgreen> Done
|-
| add regression-* tag counts to pkg stat pages
| <bgcolor=red> HIGH
| <bgcolor=lightgreen> Done
|-
| most recent version of the package - per release and per pocket; https://edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ports; also refer to "More info on the packge itself" section above
| <bgcolor=orange> MEDIUM
| 
|-
| Bugs with bzr branches - possible to find these with bugnumbers
| <bgcolor=orange> MEDIUM
| 
|-
| graphs should use the svg instead of a png file (May need change to the php code)
| <bgcolor=orange> MEDIUM
| <bgcolor=lightgreen> - Done from QA side, need the server side to be updated with new <embed> html tags
|-
| Last at zero counter* [see footnote]
| <bgcolor=orange> MEDIUM
| 
|-
| bug info for bug tags like apport-crash, apport-bug, regresssion, bitesize
| <bgcolor=orange> MEDIUM
| 
|-
| Linking to patches in Ubuntu e.g. <nowiki>[[http://patches.ubuntu.com/by-release/extracted/ubuntu/n/network-manager/0.7~~svn20080818t061112+eni0-0ubuntu1/ | n-m patches]]</nowiki> more for upstreams - another example <nowiki>[[http://patches.ubuntu.com/a/amarok/amarok_2:1.4.10-0ubuntu3.patch | amarok]]</nowiki> or http://patches.ubuntu.com/by-release/atomic/ubuntu/a/amarok/ (which scales more, as more changes are made).  also consider apparmor
| <bgcolor=orange> MEDIUM
| 
|-
| "Most duplicates" should show status and importance on mouse over
| <bgcolor=orange> MEDIUM
| <bgcolor=lightgreen> Done
|-
| a popup bug info for the oldest bugs a la the way the most duplicates bug is handled might be nice, too
| <bgcolor=orange> MEDIUM
| <bgcolor=lightgreen> Done
|-
| under 'Hot Bugs' section - list bugs with critical status before bugs with high status
| <bgcolor=orange> MEDIUM
| <bgcolor=lightgreen> Done
|-
| http://status.qa.ubuntu.com/qapkgstatus/xserver-xorg-video-ati oldest bug with status confirmed is blank but it would be better to show 'n/a'
| <bgcolor=orange> MEDIUM
| <bgcolor=lightgreen> Done
|-
| it would also be interesting if we had the number of fixed bugs under the totals section
| <bgcolor=orange> MEDIUM
| <bgcolor=lightgreen> Done
|-
| the bugs with patches stat is inaccurate because launchpad will list the same bug # multiple times.  It should be easy enough to just run the +text list through uniq to get a more accurate count or use bugnumbers --haspatch to get the correct count
| <bgcolor=orange> MEDIUM
| <bgcolor=lightgreen> Done
|-
| graph - create a three month graph
| <bgcolor=orange> MEDIUM
| <bgcolor=lightgreen> Done
|-
| Number of bugs carried over from release to release (missed milestone)
| <bgcolor=lightyellow> LOW
| 
|-
| Change the theme for the links in the number : this is not obvious, I did not notice it for a while. (Needs change to the CSS style sheet) will cause a conflict with the rest of the qa.ubuntu.com site so would require a separate CSS style sheet
| <bgcolor=lightyellow> LOW
| 
|-
| adding colors for delta's (Needs change to CSS style sheet)
| <bgcolor=lightblue> WISHLIST
| 
|-
| breakdowns by release
| <bgcolor=lightblue> WISHLIST
| 
|-
| delta's for increasing/decreasing number of duplicates and subscribers to indicate the popularity of a given bug - possibly leverage the mailing list to gather this info
| <bgcolor=lightblue> WISHLIST
| 
|-
| bug gravity - a mathematic calculation of the bugs impact using number of subscribers, comments, metoos and duplicates
| <bgcolor=lightblue> WISHLIST
| 
|-
| Delta's of bug stats for each milestone; overlaps with http://people.ubuntu.com/~ogasawara/weatherreport.html
| <bgcolor=lightblue> WISHLIST
| 
|-
| deltas should be clickable links to list of bugs e.g. the new bugs in the past seven days - wait to use the "bug bag" functionality that will come with LP 3.0
| <bgcolor=lightblue> WISHLIST
| 
|-
| vertical lines for releases and package uploads - still don't know how to do this in gnuplot
| <bgcolor=lightblue> WISHLIST
| 
|-
| bug info section for release targetted bugs
| <bgcolor=lightblue> WISHLIST
|

==== Footnote ====
* There are some bug statistics that we want to "drive to zero", for example the number of "New" bug reports or the number of bugs needing forwarding upstream.  Showing when the last time these items reached zero, or the closest they've gotten, would be motivating!
