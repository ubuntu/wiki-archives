* '''Launchpad Entry''': UbuntuSpec:qa-website-tokamak

=== Summary ===

Improving the current idea tracker part of the Ubuntu QA Website called Tokamak.

=== Release Note ===

Users can now give feedback on the features or bugs they want to see fixed or implemented in the next Ubuntu release.

=== Rationale ===

The current Tokamak works but is minimal, those changes are about improving it to make it easier to use for the users and the admins.

=== Use Cases ===

* John is a long time Ubuntu user and then has reported a lot of bugs on Launchpad. As he thinks that some of them are affecting lots of people but aren't critical enough to be fixed quickly he adds them on the tracker and blog about them. After a week or two hundreds of people show interest for this bug and the developers increase the priority and ensure it's fixed for the next release.

* Martin has some idea of how to make Ubuntu better for newcomers but don't now where to talk about his idea. He creates a forum post then add his idea on Tokamak and link it to the forum post. People then see his idea and vote for it, after some time a specification is written on Launchpad and added on Tokamak.

* Scott is an Ubuntu developer interested in what the community wants as improvment for the release to come, having not much time to surf the Internet, he adds the RSS feed to his feed reader and then read users' ideas when traveling using his cell phone or any other device including a feed reader.

=== Design ===

==== User UI ====

* There will be some links or icons pointing to the different RSS feeds (new ideas, top-50, user's favourite ideas)
* An image-link will be associated to each idea pointing to the idea page (as the digg-it button you can put on your blog)
* Status of the idea (new, work in progress, implemented, invalid)
* Users won't be able to vote for an invalid or implemented idea
* A search feature will help locating ideas we are interested in (possibly with categorizing ideas)
* When proposing a new idea, the user will be able to provide an additional description of his idea which will be shown on the idea's page.
* Users will be able to comment on an idea as we do for bugs on Launchpad (no file attachment planned though)

* Some additional fields will be available to link to other websites as youtube, digg, ... or any other URL (need to be checked against spam URL)
* The UI will be updated to be easier to use by using Javascript (AJAX) and improved icons and button/link positioning (the website must still be usable using a text browser)

* A "My ideas" page will be created showing the list of proposed and favourite ideas
* The users will be able to add ideas to a favourite/watch list which will be shown on My ideas and as a RSS feed

* An archive part will be added showing archived/expired polls

==== Admin UI ====

* The site admins will be able to add a new poll, remove one and set the expiration date (already present but not used)
* The QA admins will be able to add global polls (shown on every website)
* The site admins will be able to manually change the status of an idea

=== Implementation ===

The module already exists, it's only about adding new features.

==== Automated tasks ====

* Status syncronisation with Launchpad (using our Launchpad integration script) so a Fix released bug is shown as implemented on Tokamak

==== Migration ====

* The Tokamak website will be moving from qa.stgraber.org to tokamak.ubuntu.com for the main website, teams can have their own polling module on *.qa.ubuntu.com/qapoll

=== Test/Demo Plan ===

A test website will be running on https://qa.stgraber.org running an up to date copy of the code from Bazaar.
The website will be updated twice an hour and the database will be synced once a day.

=== Outstanding Issues ===
