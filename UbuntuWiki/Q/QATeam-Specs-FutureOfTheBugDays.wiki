    I won't be able to attend this session, so I write what I wanted to say here.
    Handle them like IRC suggestions. ;) Can be removed from the document after 
    the session is over.
***** Tighter integration/association with the Kernel Bug days?
***** Include links to documentation about triaging the kind of bugs that are
            the subject of the day and include information about upstream
***** A graphical interface(i.e. applet) for hugday-tools
***** Does 5 A Day actually do something with the hugs?
***** Include a command in hugday-tools for easy generating of a list of bugs?
***** Promote BugDays as a great way for mentees to learn triaging, encourage
            the mentees to be online on BugDays.
***** Encourage mentors to be there on BugDays to have at least one day the 
            mentor and mentee can meet and discuss the progress. <- discussed at the mentoring program. Yes we'll do that.
***** Communicate the upcoming BugDay and the results clearly, maybe via the
             planet. Spread the enthusiasm of closing many bugs.
***** How to integrate this with Adopt-a-package?
         
* Problem: its just pedro doing the work
** Not much choosing of bug targets in advance, little schedule/planning/discussion
** IRC is rather silent during bug day - makes it harder for new contributors to say anything to a quiet room
*** Generate the traffic ourselves to promote it
       - "I'm taking bug 12345...done"
       - "what do you think of bug 12345?"
       - "Im going to look for open bugs"
       - really announce which bug is being looked at
*** Mentoring
* Bot spam is bad
** have people saying "here are some bugs to work on"
*** then edit the wiki using a bot
       - the bot can be used to update the wiki page
***** close and mark in progress bugs
* Timeframe for making a bug day?
** More consistant schedules
** Announce the bug day on the same day every week
* 48 hour bug days
* Weekly bug days for small packages (Examples gwibber, empathy)
* super bug days once a month for major packages(Examples Firefox, Open Office, major cleanups)
* Maybe use launchpad api to make it easy to get info for choosing a project to help
* Bug fix contest and
** Star of the week
* At the weekly QA meeting we ask for volunteers to make the search and run the next week's bug day
** by default, have Pedro keep doing it
* do a short classroom suggestion on how to triage, how to run a bug day, etc 
*** topic varies over a rotating (6 months) basis so you don't get bored teaching
* loco events for bugs
   - "the QA team is looking for help we should do something"
* Encouraging bugcontrol candidates to organize bug days

* 5 a day 
*** it might reduce the quality of the bug reports because people might cheat by marking bugs as invalid

* encourage the ubuntu bugcontrols members to spam the planet, identi.ca, facebook, etc much more.
