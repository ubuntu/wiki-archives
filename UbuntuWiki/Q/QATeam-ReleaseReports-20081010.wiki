| compiz.real crashed with SIGSEGV
|-
| <-2>Comment: Many users are finding that this crash occurs almost immediately after startup (bug seems to be getting a few me-toos daily), and that it seems correlated to a previous update, perhaps requiring system restart. The crash doesn't seem to affect anything as compiz appears to function normally, however. A secondary concern is that someone moved bug 151200 and about 40 of its duplicates over to being a duplicate of 145360 without any explanation; there may actually be multiple metabugs within this one bug.
