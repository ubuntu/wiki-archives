| Bug task for the correct package?
| <-7> No
|-
| Is the status correct?
| <-7> Yes, because nobody else reported against the bug so it hasn't been confirmed.
|-
| What status should it be?
| <-7> New
|-
| If still new - why?
| <-7> It should probably remain New until a more specific package is assigned or someone confirms the same problem.
|-
| Is the importance correct?
| <-7> no
|-
| What importance should it be?
| <-7> Low, because it only seems to affect a single person.

| <-7> It is assigned to the ubuntu package, but it should probably be assigned to the linux or acpi package. Should mac addresses and serial numbers be private?
