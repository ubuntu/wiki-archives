__TOC__

Purpose of this page is to articulate the specific images that will be produced as part of Quantal, and the key contacts for each.  

Only images that have testers signed up for them will be released in Quantal.  Based on the identification of contacts for testing and resolving build issues, this information will feed into updates for the iso tracker and the <nowiki>[[QuantalQuetzel-ReleaseManifest|release manifest]]</nowiki>.   

All images to be produced should have their testing contacts identified by Feature Freeze.
