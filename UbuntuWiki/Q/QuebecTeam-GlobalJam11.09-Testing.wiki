__TOC__

Hardware Testing will be preformed using Checkbox. Bring your hardware and peripherals, we can help you report hardware issues, assuring that all necessary information is available to developers.

Currently the HardwareSupport wiki page is being redirected to ubuntu.com/certification. 
Instead of having a redirection to certified machines, we will make HardwareSupport a page which explains our transition and provides the projects we are now working on:

* Certified machines (Best Choice)
* Ubuntu friendly program (Work in progress)
* Old wiki resources (Legacy - cleanup needed)
** https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponents*
** https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WirelessCardsSupported
** <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Home?action=fullsearch&context=180&value=linkto%3AHardwareSupport&titlesearch=Titles|Pages linking to HardwareSupport]]</nowiki>
