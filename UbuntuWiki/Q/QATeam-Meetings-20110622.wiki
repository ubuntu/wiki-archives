<bdmurray> \o
<bdmurray> o/
<patrickmw> that was quick
== <bdmurray> so initially I'd said about 720 bug reports had workarounds in the description ==
 come to find out my search was case sensitive and its more like 10,000
<bdmurray> In all fairness the documentation does say to use WORKAROUND
<jibel> bdmurray, it that opened bug reports only or fixed as well ?
<bdmurray> regardless workarounds have been documented a fair bit and these should be communicated more and better
<bdmurray> jibel: all bugs
<jibel> bdmurray, k
<bdmurray> patrickmw: that's it
<patrickmw> thank you, bdmurray.  back to community efforts

 Thanks to everyone who helped with testing.
<jibel> micahg, sent a call for testing for firefox in Natty
 Next Oneiric milestone is in 2 weeks, but you can test daily builds until then.
 and that's all for today
== pedro_, ? any news on bugdays ? ==
<pedro_> Hello, Yes!
 there's a bug day being organized for tomorrow: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBugDay/20110623
 Unity is the target , so if you use Oneiric and want to contribute a little to make Unity rock please join us
 as always the *whole* day your timezone at #ubuntu-bugs
 ..
<patrickmw> thanks, guys

== [TOPIC] Automated/Systems Testing ==
<MootBot> New Topic:  Automated/Systems Testing
<patrickmw> = What was done last week = 
 The Automation Sprint was productive and we have been able to set goals for Oneiric and beyond. The three highest priority testing items:
* ISO server and EC2 image testing
* Kernel SRU testing
* Installer testing
 Other projects:
* Public Jenkins viewing instance
* testing notifications mailing list
* ISO server tests have been migrated to the new lab
 = What's happening this week =
* Running the tests for all images is now 8x faster.  The CPU load on the system averaged around 30%.  The current bottleneck is IO.  Once we get the new drives added we should see increased performance.
* EC2 access has been configured and we will be setting up EC2 tests
* The kernel sru testing project is undergoing modifications to prepare for Alpha 2 kernel testing
 = What we need to move forward =
* Awaiting new hardware for Installer test environment
 Questions?
<jibel> o/
<patrickmw> yes?
== <jibel> not a question, just some infos about Wubi testing ==
 Some good progress this week, I added a noninteractive mode to Wubi and I'm now able to run a wubi installation completely automatically.
 I expect to finish the automated tests of Wubi tomorrow after some polishing and testing.
 Some details still remains like selecting Ubuntu by default before reboot then back to windows by default for next run,
 switching the default windows user to auto login,
 how to start a jenkins job in Windows and report the results from Ubuntu
 and how to remove all those Ads installed by default on Windows and which pop up continuously during the test run
 I hope we'll be able to add the test machine to the automated test run next week. We have to figure
 remove the "We have to figure" c/p error
 This doesn't replace what ev plan to do with kvm autotest of course
 ..
<patrickmw> awesome!
 unless there is anything else we're moving on in 3

<patrickmw> open floor
<bdmurray> \o
<patrickmw> bdmurray, go ahead :) - your arm must be tired
= <bdmurray> As a general statement bug patterns can be really really helpful for consolidation duplicate bug =  reports and preventing further bug reports.
 I've seen some cases where people have been manually marking duplicates for bugs reported by apport where a pattern would have made things a lot easier for them.
 ..
<patrickmw> bdmurray: is there a list on the wiki of common bug patterns?
<bdmurray> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Apport/DeveloperHowTo#Bug_patterns
