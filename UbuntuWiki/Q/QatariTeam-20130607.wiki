The "Doctor" got started talking about how we can start growing the community "Umbrella" Campaign. 

Goal:  To educate, advocate, and get more Ubuntu Users!
Opportunity: The shops in Sofitel Tower that are selling Dell Laptops with Ubuntu Pre-installed could give out details of the Ubuntu Hours as a way to get new Ubuntu users linked into our community quickly. 
Approach:  Dr Syed said he will help us with our "wording" when we approach the Shop owners
