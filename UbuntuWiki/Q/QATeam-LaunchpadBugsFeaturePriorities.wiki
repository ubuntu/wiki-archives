__TOC__

The following is a list of suggested enhancements to Launchpad bugs and HW database over the next year. The list is compiled by the Launchpad team based on feedback they have received. A priority rating will be assigned to each feature by a representative of MOTU and Ubuntu QA, ReinhardTartler and HenrikOmma respectively, after discussions in the teams. For the QA team the results will be presented to Launchpad Friday Aug. 8th.

** Choose 15-20 items from the list below in the order you'd like them implemented.
** Mark '-' for ones you don't care about.
** estimated effort in story points, an abstract unit

=== Other items ===

The following are items not on the original list that are important to Ubuntu QA:

* A stable and well documented set of APIs - this is key for us to develop tools that work with Launchpad
* Speed - improving the performance of the web interface will make working with bugs more practical for heavy users and more inviting for new contributors
