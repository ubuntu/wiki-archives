=== About me ===

{{http://i.imgur.com/aOluY.jpg}}

I'm QIII!  Dorpee dorp dorp!

==== Personally ====

If I were to try to say where I am from, I might have to write a fairly long book.  I suppose I could say I am from the United States -- all of them.  My Dad's from Montana, Mom's from North Dakota and we seemed to pitch camp in Montana more than elsewhere while I was growing up.  That's where I spent most of my first 8 years in College, so I call Montana "home".  I have lived in the Pacific Northwest since 2001 and don't plan to resume my wandering ways any time soon.

Happily married to a great lady I happened to meet, probably tripped over, and certainly stepped on her toes while we danced, when I was three sheets to the wind in Washington, DC, some years back while in my Army Dress Blues.  Must have been the uniform.  I have no other explanation for why such a fine young woman gave me the time of day all those years ago!

Together, we've raised two wonderful, talented and extraordinarily intelligent children.  We've also opened our home to a whole lot of folks who were down on their luck, just passing through, or just needed shelter from the rain for a little while.  And then there are the foster kids.  It would just seem to be a shame to have this big old house and not share.

I've been an avid hunter, fisherman and outdoorsman all my life -- but things have slowed me down a bit after a lot of miles down bumpy dirt roads in the back country of life. 

==== Professionally ====

I'm currently a software developer, specializing in computationally intensive projects for a clientele which prizes discretion, so I can't say much more.

I started herding electrons in the 70s and kept up with it the whole time I was in the Army, developing a couple of applications that are still being used, albiet much improved and changed.

=== Linux and Ubuntu ===

I started using Linux in the mid to late 90s, using RedHat.  In those days, it was a lot of fun for a guy who likes to break things and put them back together with very little documentation and help back then.  Linux reminded me of my Unix days, so it wasn't a really unfamiliar new world.

By 2001 or 2002, I was using Linux at home as my primary.  I started using Ubuntu with Warty and soon make Ubuntu my primary.  I was still a do-it-yourself type and didn't take part in much on-line discussion.  I did use what resources there were to answer my own questions.

Somewhat infrequently these days, I also use Fedora, OpenSUSE, CentOS and Bodhi Linux.

==== Ubuntu Forums ====
 
I joined the <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntuforums.org | Ubuntu forums]]</nowiki> in 2008, asked a few questions here and there at first and then began spending my time mostly answering questions.  For the last couple of years my involvement has taken off.  Although I help out with a range of subjects, lately I have found myself involved most of the time in questions/issues regarding the ATI Proprietary driver and Oracle Java.

==== Wikis ====

Recently I have been doing extensive editing of the <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI | ATI proprietary driver community wiki]]</nowiki> and the <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java | Java community wiki]]</nowiki>.

==== U+1 Team ====

I recently joined the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/U+1/ | U+1]]</nowiki> team.  I've been using the development releases during the testing periods for several releases, but my time is limited and the bugs/issues I find always seem to have been discovered and handled on Launchpad before I get around to them.  Precise was such a breeze I just gave up and started using it heavily around the end of the Alpha testing stage, except that I'd boot to Natty specifically when I wanted to use proprietary video drivers.  When things started working with the ATI drive at the end of the Beta stage, I went all in.  Quantal seems to be going the same way.  Dang it!

==== Ubuntu Oregon LoCo Team ====

I am a member of the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-us-or | Ubuntu Oregon LoCo]]</nowiki> team.
