==== Agenda - 2007-10-03 ====

* <nowiki>[[QATeam-Meetings-OsloSprint|Report]]</nowiki> from the testing mini-sprint in Oslo
* Selecting topics for UDS
* Release Candidate next week - where are we on bugs?
* QA team wiki pages
** Should this one be merged with UbuntuQA?
** How can we make the connections between the teams less confusing?
* Agree upon a method for communicating high profile or well known bug reports amongst each other.  It should be something that developers can add bug reports that they are working on too.
** The bugsquad mailing list might be a good idea so other triagers see it to, the mailing list reports could then be added to a wiki page or vice versa
