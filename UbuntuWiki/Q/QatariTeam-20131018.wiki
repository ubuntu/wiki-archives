=== Minutes ===

We had a good meeting with the largest attendance to date - Nine :) 

We chatted a bit about strategies and ways to increase awareness and members of the community - First time visitors Mohammed and Deya offered an alternate venue for the next meeting - They said we would be welcome to use their offices (which are close to the Museum of Islamic Art Round-about).  We would have access to a meeting room with projector and screen where we can meet and start working towards the goals of:
* Increasing the membership of the Loco
* Increasing the knowledge of the Loco members (through training sessions, video library, etc.)
* Increasing awareness of Ubuntu (in general) through-out Qatar

Due to the Eid weekend the venue was about three times as busy as usual on a Friday afternoon, and the wifi was intermitted, so we didn't do much else.  First time visitor Horacio however did a live demonstration of <nowiki>[[SaucySalamander]]</nowiki> on a Dell Vostro.  

Horacio first did a "demo" of Ubuntu in <nowiki>[[LiveCD]]</nowiki> mode, and then proceeded with setting up Ubuntu alongside the existing operating system, similar to the steps in this link: <nowiki>[[http://askubuntu.com/questions/107538/how-do-i-set-up-a-dual-boot-windows-and-ubuntu|DualBoot]]</nowiki>     

Various conversations spread off in different directions, including an attempt to remedy new-comer Gary's Radeon Video Card issue in Ubuntu.  We didn't have enough to address it though, but will try fix it before we meet next week.  

We ended around 6:15pm and look forward to having a meeting next week. (Details to be added)
