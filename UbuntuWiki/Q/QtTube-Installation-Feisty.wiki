__TOC__

This page provides installing on how to install QtTube on Ubuntu Feisty 7.04 (this may also work on previous versions).

=== Getting the dependencies ===

<pre>
sudo aptitude -y install python-qt4 && cd ~/Desktop && wget http://www.arrakis.es/~rggi3/youtube-dl/youtube-dl && sudo mv ./youtube-dl /usr/local/bin && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/youtube-dl
</pre>

''Note that you can't get youtube-dl from Feisty's repositories since the version available there doesn't include it's feature used by QtTube. If you have it already installed, run the previous command anyways and then you can either uninstall youtube-dl or, on QtTube, open Edit -> Preferences and on "Location of the 'youtube-dl' script" write "/usr/local/bin/youtube-dl".''

=== Running or Installing QtTube ===

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run and/or install QtTube following the <nowiki>[[QtTube/Installation|common instructions]]</nowiki> for GNU/Linux.
