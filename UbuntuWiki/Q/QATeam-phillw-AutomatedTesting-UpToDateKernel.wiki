== 12.10 Kernel on 12.04 testing ==

How to test the 12.10 Kernel and X stack on 12.04 + other necessary packages.

=== Testing brainstorm ===
* Daily or as fast as needed
* VMs (KVM, XEN)
* Hardware
** audio -> needs a plan for spot checking to be automated
** video -> some good automated testing (pitti to review test plan) What will be the set of tests to run?
*** xorg-gtest
*** piglit (tests 3d)
*** client-space / application tests
** video hardware
*** Intel
*** ATI w/ -ati driver
*** ATI w/ -fglrx driver
*** NVIDIA w/ -nouveau driver
*** NVIDIA w/ -nvidia driver
** new hardware
*** will run these tests on new hardware platforms 

QA to have a dashboard for 12.04 with updates with latest kernel testing ready by 05/24. 

=== Building ===

Single toolchain? NO

12.10 to build on 12.04 toolchain
Kernel and X server stack into a ppa, along with required packages

=== Things Worth Testing ===
* Verify that xdmx, xnest, xvfb and xserver-xephyr are installable (and still start up properly)
