== Application Testing ==
Application testing is the manual testing of specific things (''test cases'') in applications.  ''Regression tests'' are specific tests for potential breakages from one release to another (they're also relevant for SRU testing).

'''Advantages:''' Many of the testcases are very quick to do.  Uploading your results to the wiki is also relatively painless - all you need is a launchpad account.

'''Disadvantages:''' Unlike general testing, application tests require you to follow a specific set of procedures purely for testing purposes.  Since existing application tests tend to cover either general functionality or parts that broke in a previous release, you may need to help write new test cases for a program to ensure good coverage.

If you are interested in this kind of testing, head to <nowiki>[[http://packages.qa.ubuntu.com/|Packages QATracker]]</nowiki> and run through the application testcases and report your results.
