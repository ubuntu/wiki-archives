== Introduction ==
`autopkgtest` tests can be very easily integrated into existing source packages and easily test-run locally. http://packaging.ubuntu.com/html/auto-pkg-test.html shows how to easily get started with this kind of tests. Log in to <nowiki>[[http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=ubuntu-quality|#ubuntu-quality]]</nowiki> to ask questions and get help.

If you decide to work on one of the tests, please add `@``SIG``@` behind the package in question and if you submitted a test-case for review already, you might want to add a link to it.

== Required Tests ==
For the following packages we require `autopkgtest` tests.

=== simple compile/link/run tests ===
The idea here is to test if we can easily compile and link against these libraries and run some very basic code. 

The following tests might serve as inspiration: 
* '''Example:''' <nowiki>[[http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-branches/ubuntu/quantal/glib2.0/quantal/view/head:/debian/tests/build|glib tests]]</nowiki>
* '''Example:''' <nowiki>[[http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-branches/ubuntu/quantal/gtk+3.0/quantal/view/head:/debian/tests/build|gtk tests]]</nowiki>.

For these libraries we require tests:

== functionality tests ==
The following packages don't have tests at all. It'd be great to let tests exercise the most common functionality and workflow (ie. for d-conf this might be: check reading, writing of schema keys, handling of invalid values for types, and schema creation/compilation, for a lens this might be: create a temporary home directory with some files, and check that these files are found).

== run upstream test suite against system installed packages ==
What we want to do here is to get the upstream test suite run as part of the autopkgtest. 

This is what's done here as well:
'''Example:''' <nowiki>[[http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-branches/ubuntu/quantal/ubiquity/quantal/view/head:/debian/tests/unit|ubiquity tests]]</nowiki>

For the following tests we want to run upstream test-suites:

== review package for tests ==
The following packages could do with some tests but have not been reviewed to see if they have upstream tests yet; if they have something usable then enable the upstream tests; otherwise write some basic functional tests to exercise the package.
