 <''''''> [TOPIC] Bug Day

=== Bug Day ===
 <''''''> Hello

 <''''''> Last Thursday we had a bug day for Compiz, ~20 bugs were triaged that day, you can see the progress of that on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBugDay/20101209

 <''''''> Thanks to kamusin and to njin for triaging bugs during that day

* '''''' :)

 <''''''> Tomorrow we're having a bug day for the amazing Software Center, there's plenty of bugs waiting to be triaged

 <''''''> so if you have some time and want to learn about bug triage join us at #ubuntu-bugs , the Ubuntu BugSquad will be glad to help you to start

 <''''''> and as always the page is:  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBugDay/20101216

 <''''''> special thanks to kamusin for helping with the organization of it

 <''''''> bdmurray, that's all from here unless there's a question/comment

 <''''''> pedro_: nope, it looks like the bug day will a be good one.  Lots of interesting stuff in that list.

 <''''''> indeed :-)

 <''''''> it might be interesting to sort bug day bugs by title

 <''''''> ouch

 <''''''> That might help with duplicates, too, huh?

 <''''''> right that was my thought at least

 <''''''> okay moving on
