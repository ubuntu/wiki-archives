The Kubuntu community is proud to announce the release of 12.10, the Quantal Quetzal.  This is the first release to burst free from the limits of CD sizes giving us some more space for goodies on the image.  

It also does away with the alternate installer images, adding advanced partitioning options to the desktop image.

Built on Ubuntu's core and polished with KDE’s applications and workspaces, Kubuntu 12.10 is a grand example of friendly, fast and beautiful software. We recommend it as the perfect OS for casual users, students, Linux gamers, software developers, professionals and anyone interested in a free, open platform that is both beautiful and useful.

<nowiki>[[attachment:ubiquity-partitioner.png | <nowiki>[[File:ubiquity-partitioner.png||width=400]]</nowiki></nowiki>]]

We're bursting out of our increasingly limited CD-sized images.  The 12.10 images need to be installed from a DVD or USB drive.  This will give us the room to ship more of the world-class KDE Software.
