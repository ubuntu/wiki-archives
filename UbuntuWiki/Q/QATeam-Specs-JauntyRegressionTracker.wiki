=== Summary ===

In Intrepid, we started basic regression tracking. A basic prototype webpage developed at  http://people.ubuntu.com/~sbeattie/regression_tracker.html but needs improvement. We document this at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QATeam/RegressionTracking

=== Rationale ===

We want to help the development team identify, track, and fix regressions, as these are particularly frustrating for users.

=== Use Cases ===

We want to identify and raise the priority of regressions for:

* potential regressions in the upcoming release under development (hopefully to fix before release)
* regressions in the current supported releases versus the prior release
* regressions in a package that occurred in an update within a release
* regressions in a package proposed for an update (sitting in the RELEASE-proposed)

We currently track this through the use of tags in launchpad. Are the better ways to do this?

We also want to do data tracking over time, to see whether our processes are improving.

=== Assumptions ===

=== Design ===

Split out the report into two classes of reports:

* developer-oriented pages that show confirmed regression reports (to keep noise away from the developers)
* QA-oriented pages to find reported regressions that haven't been identified as such.

=== Implementation ===

Current tasks:

* Splitting out the pages into per-tag pages
* move bug reports that are unconfirmed (new or incomplete) to a separate QA page
* searches for keywords for QA

Other ideas?

==== UI Changes ====

Should cover changes required to the UI, or specific UI that is required to implement this

==== Code Changes ====

Code changes should include an overview of what needs to change, and in some cases even the specific details.

==== Migration ====

Include:
* data migration, if any
* redirects from old URLs to new ones, if any
* how users will be pointed to the new way of doing things, if necessary.

=== Test/Demo Plan ===

It's important that we are able to test new features, and demonstrate them to users.  Use this section to describe a short plan that anybody can follow that demonstrates the feature is working.  This can then be used during testing, and to show off after release. Please add an entry to http://testcases.qa.ubuntu.com/Coverage/NewFeatures for tracking test coverage.

This need not be added or completed until the specification is nearing beta.

=== Unresolved issues ===

This should highlight any issues that should be addressed in further specifications, and not problems with the specification itself; since any specification with problems cannot be approved.

=== BoF agenda and discussion ===

Use this section to take notes during the BoF; if you keep it in the approved spec, use it for summarising what was discussed and note any options that were rejected.
