== What is a broken build? ==

We consider a build or an image to be broken when it is not suited for further testing. 

=== How do we decide if an image is broken? ===
The smoke testing runs daily and determines whether an image is broken or not. 

<nowiki>[[https://jenkins.qa.ubuntu.com/view/Precise%20ISO%20Testing%20Dashboard/view/Daily/?|Results]]</nowiki> can be found on Jenkins. The testing kicks off every time that a new image is published on the daily websites. 

=== How to know what bugs are associated to a particular image? ===
There is a <nowiki>[[http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/qa/qa-open-bugs.html|report]]</nowiki> that shows which bugs have been found for a particular image. 

The bugs associated with smoke testing are the ones under the "ISO Daily Testing" group, at the top of the report. If the date of the bug is the one of the image, and the bug is high or critical, the image is not suitable for further testing.
