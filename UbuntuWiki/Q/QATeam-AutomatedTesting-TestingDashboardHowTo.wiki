__TOC__

To be able to keep track of bugs raised as a result of automated testing, whenever a bug is added to launchpad, it needs to be reflected in the Jenkins description for that particular job run. 

There are two bits of information that are part of the description:

** Build Number: usual format, i.e. 20120512
** Bugs: The bugs will be referenced by a string of the format: <code> LP:#111111 </code>

If there is a build, it is always at the beginning of the description. Followed by as many bugs as required, all comma separated. No white spaces no trailing spaces, just a nice parsable comma separated values string.
