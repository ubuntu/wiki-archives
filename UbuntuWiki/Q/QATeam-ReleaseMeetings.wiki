__TOC__


The QA Team has a presence at the (nearly) weekly Release Team meetings (<nowiki>[[ReleaseTeam-Meeting-2008-07-31|an example]]</nowiki>) in which it should give a brief status report. These meetings focus on the next upcoming release, so reported items should be tailored to that release.

We'll keep a standing agenda item in the QA Team's <nowiki>[[QATeam-Meetings|weekly meetings]]</nowiki> to cover these issues.

=== Meeting Reports ===

=== Items to Report ===

* serious bugs we've found, not yet on the milestone list
* bugs that need their priority/attention increased
* the state of our testing infrastructure - including blocking bugs for automation, kvm, etc
** these may not be blockers for the release as such, but  makes testing difficult
* new regressions (of some minimum threshold of importance?) See <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bugs?field.tag=regression-potential|bugs tagged with regression-potential]]</nowiki>
* iso/smoke/automated testing results
* basic bug stats relevant to release?

''See <nowiki>[[QATeam-ReleaseReports-Template|report template]]</nowiki>''
