== More Information ==

This section provides an more detailed introduction to the use of the qa-tracker and how the cycle works. As with all alphas and betas they are not suitable for a production environment, please take the time to read <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1594833 | Common Questions for Testing]]</nowiki>. This is specific to iso testing, but the methodology of testing applies to all areas.

=== Testing ===
Testing is split into distinct, but joined areas. The '''Daily Builds''', the '''QA-testing of Milestone releases''' and the '''Milestone releases''' themselves.

To not get overly complicated, think of it as that we have a <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QuantalQuetzal/ReleaseSchedule | schedule]]</nowiki> to keep to.

All release stages are tracked by <nowiki>[[http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/ | ISO Tracker]]</nowiki> where you can get the latest builds, see and allocate any <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lubuntu/ReportingBugs | Bugs]]</nowiki>.

So, in order of how they happen.

==== Daily Builds ====

These iso's are automatically generated every 24 hours using the latest updates on the system from the devs. They are available from <nowiki>[[http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/|ISO tracker]]</nowiki>. Using the <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ZsyncCdImage | zsync (or rsync)]]</nowiki> option allows you to update your <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BurningIsoHowto |iso]]</nowiki> to any of the various dailies you choose to follow without having to re-download the entire iso. They are there to check that bugs that are resolved between the Milestone releases do not break the install. They also are used to confirm that any fix for a bug that seriously affects an initial install which is released for testing now works. 

==== QA testing of Milestone releases ====

A few days before a Milestone is due, the daily is plucked and becomes the QA (Quality Assurance) test version for the Milestone release. Once it is confirmed that the QA version works, it then becomes the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lubuntu/Testing#Milestone_Releases | Milestone]]</nowiki>. At this point, the dailies are suspended and new versions will only appear when a major bug warrants a re-spin (A new version).

Alpha, Beta and Final Release Candidates (RC) are also tested using <nowiki>[[http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/|ISO tracker]]</nowiki>. If you want to help out in this important area of testing, please read through <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/ISO/Procedures | Procedures]]</nowiki> for further details.

'''QA testing is to ensure the actual install iso works, if you can, please get involved in the qa testing'''

==== Milestone Releases ====

Once a Milestone release passes the QA testing, it becomes a Milestone Release and is listed on the <nowiki>[[http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/ | Releases]]</nowiki> as such. The <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QuantalQuetzal/TechnicalOverview | technical overview]]</nowiki> is also updated so that any known problems are available.

If you would to know more about how this all works, have a read of <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lubuntu/Testing/TheStages | Stages of testing]]</nowiki>. Alternate is <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/ISO/Milestones | Milestones]]</nowiki>.

=== General Testing ===
During the release cycle, things will get broken. You can really reduce these occurrences by taking the time to read <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1479146|Partial Upgrades]]</nowiki>.

==== Manual test of ISO and CD ====
On the help-pages of Ubuntu there is an extensive guide on <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM|how to MD5SUM]]</nowiki>.

=== Specific Testing ===

==== QA tests ====
You can do more specific tests, like ones done for the Ubuntu ISO : http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/qatracker/test/5090
