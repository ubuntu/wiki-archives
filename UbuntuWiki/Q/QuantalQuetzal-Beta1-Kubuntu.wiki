As October nears, the Kubuntu team has been hard at work preparing for the final release of 12.10, the Quantal Quetzal. With this first Beta release, we are finalizing the changes we are making and buttoning things down. We have some interesting things happening, so read on for highlights and information. 

'''NOTE:''' This is a beta pre-release. 
Kubuntu Pre-releases are NOT recommended for:
* Regular users who are not aware of pre-release issues
* Anyone who needs a stable system
* Anyone uncomfortable running a possibly frequently broken system
* Anyone in a production environment with data or workflows that need to be reliable

Kubuntu Pre-releases ARE recommended for:
* Regular users who want to help us test by finding, reporting, and/or fixing bugs involving installation, updgrades, and regular usage.
* Kubuntu developers

== Beta Highlights ==

=== 1GB Images ===
We're bursting out of our increasingly limited CD-sized images.  The 12.10 images need to be installed from a DVD or USB drive.  This will give us the room to ship more of the world-class KDE Software.

Highlights include further integration of Qt Quick in plasmoids making them more attractive, easier to enhance and extend and behave better on touchscreens.  Dolphin file manager has improved its display and sorting and searching based on metadata. Deeper integration of Activities for files, windows and other resources. Kontact PIM suite sees bug fixes and performance improvements and introduces new tools to import mail, filters, account information, calendar data and address book entries from Thunderbird and Evolution.

Okular document viewer and Gwenview image browser both also see added functionality and improvements.
