=== Hackfests ===
During a scheduled hackfest, people gather together and make themselves available for the community to work on a shared goal. A hackfest usually has one main focus, but all kinds of contributions are encouraged during the events.

To prepare for the hackfest, schedule free time for the event. On the appropriate Hackfest page, sign up for tasks (you can also just show up and help people with whatever they are working on). If you are planning to work on something that needs a specific setup done, take time to do that before the hackfest to save time on the actual hackfest hours.

The QA Team hackfests are organized on the '''<nowiki>[[http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=ubuntu-quality|#ubuntu-quality]]</nowiki>''' IRC channel on the Freenode IRC network.

A hackfest is an opportunity to learn and get help from other people as well as get loads of work done in a short timespan. We heartily recommend participating!
