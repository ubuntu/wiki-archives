 14:03:45 <balloons> Ok, let's do a quick role call and see who's around

 14:03:56 <phillw> o/

 14:04:51 <MohamedAlaa98> me :)

 14:05:11 <balloons> excellent :-)

 14:05:20 <balloons> I can only assume everyone else is iso testing :-)

 14:05:34 <balloons> [TOPIC] Previous Actions

 14:06:25 <balloons> I don't believe we have any

 14:07:08 <balloons> [TOPIC] Ubuntu Updates

 14:07:56 <balloons> So, I wonder if gema is around

 14:08:11 <balloons> the UK has had a bit of a holiday and long weekend

 14:08:31 <phillw> we're all supposed to be back today :)

 14:08:33 <pitti> in general she is

 14:08:59 <balloons> that's right.. everyone is back today :-)

 14:09:09 <balloons> We'll move on for the moment to the flavors I think

 14:09:33 <balloons> [TOPIC] Ubuntu Flavor Updates

 14:09:59 <balloons> phillw, why don't you start us off -- and is your successor around?

 14:10:19 <phillw> my successor has not agreed to the role - so you're stuck with me :P

 14:10:39 <balloons> :p

 14:11:12 <phillw> testing seems okay. a few minor niggles. One thing that is causing concern is that there does not appear to be a browser for ppc builds in 12.10 (they used Ffox in 12.04).

 14:11:22 <MohamedAlaa98> I'm still here :)

 14:12:04 <balloons> phillw, what do you mean no browser?

 14:12:25 <phillw> no Chromium (never was ppc) but no Ffox either this time.

 14:12:46 <balloons> aka, there's no ppc build for ffox..

 14:12:46 <phillw> http://launchpad.net/bugs/1008975

 14:12:47 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1008975 in lubuntu-meta (Ubuntu) "Firefox and Chromium missing from powerpc live cd image" [Undecided,Incomplete]

 14:12:54 <balloons> did they drop support on ff's end?

 14:13:24 <MohamedAlaa98> quit

 14:13:49 <phillw> idk, I was made aware of it a couple of days ago. The lubuntu-qa team is in discussion with Julien, but I guess it would affect all of the ppc builds?

 14:14:11 <balloons> seems like it does https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=691898

 14:14:14 <ubottu> Mozilla bug 691898 in JavaScript Engine "Use YARR interpreter instead of PCRE on platforms where YARR JIT is not supported, since PCRE doesnt build" [Normal,Resolved: fixed]

 14:15:10 <balloons> anyways, it looks like they fixed the issue, so it should be possible to build on ppc again with there code changes

 14:15:43 <phillw> excellent news, i will communicate it to the testers :)

 14:16:39 <balloons> well, julien linked to the ubuntu bug, which is still pending

 14:16:43 <phillw> how do we go about getting it into 12.10?

 14:16:48 <balloons> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firefox/+bug/987421

 14:16:50 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 987421 in thunderbird (Ubuntu Quantal) "Firefox/Thunderbird 12 FTBFS on powerpc" [Medium,Triaged]

 14:17:17 <phillw> okies, I'll leave it in Juliens' capable hands :)

 14:17:21 <balloons> :-)

 14:17:34 <balloons> the good news is it CAN be fixed, how's that?

 14:17:45 <balloons> anything else to report?

 14:18:05 <phillw> nope. I'm done :)

 14:18:38 <balloons> thanks phillw

 14:18:59 <balloons> and as always, thanks to all the lubuntu QA team -- you guys are doing good work again on alpha one :-)

 14:19:50 <balloons> alright, do we have someone from xubuntu?

 14:21:02 <balloons> astraljava, you about?

 14:21:38 <balloons> how about ubuntu studio?

 14:22:30 <balloons> Well I can give the update for both that they are not participating in alpha 1..

 14:22:43 <balloons> anyone around for kubuntu?

 14:22:55 <balloons> They too are not issuing iso's for alpha 1

 14:23:37 <Riddell> mm?

 14:23:41 <Riddell> I'm testing alpha 1 right now

 14:23:49 <balloons> err.. sorry Riddell

 14:24:04 <balloons> yes, not the full suite of images.. just the desktop for alpha 1

 14:24:12 <balloons> correct?

 14:24:24 <Riddell> right, which will probably become the full suite of images

 14:25:05 <balloons> great, anything else to report -- how's the testing going?

 14:25:20 <Riddell> pleasingly well

 14:26:26 <balloons> anything else to add?

 14:26:43 <Riddell> not just now

 14:26:56 <balloons> that's great news.. I hope it's smooth sailing for you :-)

 14:27:25 <balloons> Alright, finally mythbuntu, which isn't pushing out a DVD for alpha 1

 14:28:37 <balloons> [TOPIC] Other Updates

 14:28:46 <balloons> I suppose I shall fill in then for updates for ubuntu

 14:28:55 <balloons> As everyone knows, it's alpha 1 testing time

 14:29:11 <balloons> we've had a few respins already, fixing some kernel bugs and other issues

 14:30:23 <balloons> the following caused respins:

 14:30:24 <balloons> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-base/+bug/1006717

 14:31:42 <balloons> thanks to everyone testing on alpha 1 and helping find and sort out these issues

 14:32:37 <balloons> Updates from me:

 14:32:58 <balloons> working on the first call for testing to be announced tomorrow -- we'll be testing the 12.10 kernel on 12.04 and using the qatracker to do it :-)

 14:33:37 <balloons> working with popey to understand how unity testing will happen this cycle

 14:34:04 <balloons> and meeting with the hexr team to understand how we can roll out a community hardware database using HEXR

 14:34:28 <balloons> Anyone else have a question or update they'd like to share?

 14:34:37 <phillw> o/

 14:34:46 <balloons> go ahead

 14:35:24 <phillw> do you have the link to the area where the devs flag up what is being considered to cause a respin. It was an excellent resource last time :)

 14:37:08 <balloons> phillw, sure

 14:37:39 <phillw> afaik, no one dared edit anything on it last cycle from lubuntu-qa :)

 14:37:54 <balloons> hehe :-)

 14:38:10 <balloons> yes, also I was just checking, but the build notes for the iso's should contain the same information

 14:39:09 <balloons> I'm not sure I'm seeing such things, so that's something for me to follow-up with

 14:39:38 <balloons> alright, anything else?

 14:39:44 <balloons> if not, we're finishing up early :-)

 14:39:53 <jibel> o/

 14:40:01 <balloons> jibel, go ahead

 14:40:25 <jibel> about quantal alpha 1 testing

 14:40:26 <jibel> as you said we've had a few respins already

 14:40:48 <jibel> I'd just like to mention that there is a build in progress of ubuntu desktop

 14:41:02 <jibel> and new images will be published in 1h or so

 14:41:06 <balloons> jibel, ohh really? ahh

 14:41:19 <jibel> so stay tuned on #ubuntu-testing to help us review these images

 14:41:20 <balloons> I just synced and was surprised nothing new came in overnight

 14:41:23 <jibel> balloons, really

 14:41:53 <jibel> we need tests on HW with wireless and Macs

 14:42:06 <jibel> but review on VM won't hurt :)

 14:42:13 <balloons> your bugfix is landing for the mac mini?

 14:42:43 <jibel> yep, new kernel to fix a bug with B43 wireless cards

 14:43:07 <jibel> and fix in Ubiquity to workaround a bug in python3

 14:43:20 <jibel> that's all from me

 14:43:21 <jibel> ..

 14:43:24 <balloons> thanks jibel !

 14:43:47 <balloons> ok, everyone thanks for coming out.. happy testing
