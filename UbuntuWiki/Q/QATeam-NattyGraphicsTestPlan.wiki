== Introduction ==

=== Objectives ===
The objective of this document is to define a test plan for ATI/NVidia proprietary driver testing, graphics and performance in Unity. 

=== Scope ===
The testing tasks includes:
* Testing of ATI and NVidia proprietary drivers
* Test cases that are known for:
** Crashes
** Visual corruption
** Performance impact

For each testing task we will also:
* Collect test data and review testing results.
* Reporting of all test results.
* Risk analysis and communication of the blocking issues.

=== Deliverables ===
* This test plan
* At the end of each testing milestone QA will provide a test report for that testing cycle.  
* All defects found will be reported in Launchpad.

=== Testing procedure ===

The testing procedure and call for testing is available from the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Testing/ProprietaryDrivers/Natty/WeeklyProgram|X Testing Wiki]]</nowiki>

== X Drivers Testing ==

There are 11 test cases covering all aspects of the ATI and NVidia proprietary drivers, from installation, basic and standard functionalities (resolutions, rotation, monitor hot plugging,...) and removal of the drivers.

They are available from <nowiki>[[http://testcases.qa.ubuntu.com/Hardware/X/ProprietaryDrivers|testcases.qa.ubuntu.com]]</nowiki>

== Unity Graphics Performance and reliability ==

These test cases are available from http://testcases.qa.ubuntu.com/Hardware/X/GraphicsVideoPerformance

== Target Hardware ==
=== NVIDIA Cards ===
GPUs such as GeForce series 6 or newer are supported and have the hardware capabilities needed to run Unity. 

For a complete list, install the package nvidia-current and see /usr/share/doc/nvidia-current/README.txt.gz 

=== ATI Cards ===
* R6xx (HD 2xxx, HD 3xxx)
* R7xx (HD 4xxx)
* R8xx (HD 5xxx) "Evergreen" series
* (HD 6xxx) "Northern Islands" series

* + Mobile cards
* And more generally all the graphics chips that are sold today by AMD have the hardware capabilities we need to run Unity. We can safely go as far as 5 years and the GPUs that were made by either of these companies will still offer the hardware features we need.

== Acceptance Criteria ==
=== Acceptance Criteria: Phase 1 - Alpha ===
The Phase 1 Alpha deliverable will be considered met when all the basic functionality of the software and hardware is complete.  The client will have the ability to test the deliverable software and hardware functionality.  There may be defects in this milestone that will be addressed in the next Phase.  Performance and reliability requirements are out of scope for the Alpha release.  

The image may have Critical, High and Medium bugs.

=== Acceptance Criteria: Phase 2 - Beta ===
The Phase 2 Beta release will be considered feature complete based on the Statement of Work.  This image will also include bug fixes.  The image may have a limited number of Critical bugs. Performance and reliability requirements are acceptable for the Beta release.  

=== Acceptance Criteria: Phase 3 – Final Release ===
This image will be the Final release.

All features will be complete.  
There are no Critical bugs. A minimum of High level bugs may be present.
