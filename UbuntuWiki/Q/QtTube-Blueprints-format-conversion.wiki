=== Overview ===

An option to convert .flv files to another format after download should be available for each download (on the main window), and it should be also available to choose it for all downloads from the Preferences menu.

Also there should be an option (only in the Preferences window?) to decide to keep the original .flv files, delete them, or move them to a long-lasting temporal directory (perhaps somewhere in /var) and make many purge options available (remove after 1 day, etc).

=== Technical Details ===

Possible programs that can be used for the conversion:

* ffmpeg
* ffmepg2theora
* <nowiki>[[http://vixynet.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/vixynet/trunk/flv2mpeg4/|vixy]]</nowiki>

Or either use gstreamer's Python bindings (import gst)
