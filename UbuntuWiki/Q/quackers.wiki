=== About Me ===

I am semi-retired and live in the north of England.
My introduction to computers came in the form of a ICL ME29 mainframe in 1989. 
I had absolutely no computer experience. I didn't even own a personal computer at the time (and I didn't own one for another 15 years after).
Within a year I was running the mainframe and writing small search programmes to cut down on the amount of "legwork" required to find accounts with a given set of circumstances.

I bought my first pc (a laptop) in 2004 and started using Windows XP at that time. I've since moved through Vista to Windows 7, but along the way I became disheartened that a company the size of MS, which had been writing operating systems for so long could still be getting it so wrong.
I tried Ubuntu in 2007, and although I liked what I saw, it didn't work very well with my hardware. I therefore persevered with Windows in its various forms.
I finally had had enough of it and installed Lucid Lynx on my newer hardware (a Sony Vaio AR51SU) and was extremely pleased with how much worked "out of the box". 

=== Ubuntu Contributions ===

I needed help at times and that help was forthcoming from the UbuntuForums - willingly and pleasantly, I might add. I was impressed with both Lucid Lynx and the community spirit offered at UbuntuForums.
I decided early on that I would try to help others in the same way that others had helped me.
I have spent most of my spare time on UbuntuForums giving help and advice where I thought I could do some good. The majority of that time has been spent in the Absolute Beginner, General Help and Installation & Upgrade forums trying to help people with booting problems/partitioning problems and anything else that I thought I could give help with.

I have also taken part in the Maverick and Natty Testing Forums giving (but mostly receiving) help.
I now run a couple of Natty Narwhal installations (amongst other Ubuntu flavours) and am currently enjoying its new interface.

=== Interests & Hobbies ===

I have a compulsion, it seems, to install as many versions of Ubuntu as I can, all at the same time!  Raid, non-raid, I'll try anything!

I enjoy watching motor racing in its various track-based forms - both cars and bikes.
I play and watch golf and I play snooker to a reasonably high standard.

=== Goals ===

I promote Ubuntu every chance I get and am currently converting a number of family and friends to the "right path".
As I learn more I hope to play a greater role in taking Ubuntu forward to total world domination by means of bug reporting and testing new versions.
