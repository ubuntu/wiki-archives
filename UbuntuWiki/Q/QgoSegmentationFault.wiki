This page has been created to provide a description of <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/qgo/+bug/4048|Bug 4048]]</nowiki>.

In Ubuntu 6.06 Dapper Drake, qgo segfault at startup, even with the default configuration. The bug is reproductible, and that is also the case with the Live CD (tested with <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-announce/2006-May/000081.html|Release Candidate]]</nowiki>).

== Steps to reproduce the bug ==

Here is the method to reproduce the bug if you don't want to install Dapper, or if you want to fiddle with a default system :

 1. Dowload and burn <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-announce/2006-May/000081.html|Ubuntu 6.06 Dapper Drake Release Candidate]]</nowiki>

 2. Boot with the defaults

 3. Connect to the internet (System>Administration>Networking, or if you are an ADSL user <nowiki>[[#ADSL|Follow this procedure]]</nowiki>)

 4. Lauch System>Administration>Synaptic Package Manager.

 Go to Preferences>Repositories

 Select Ubuntu 6.06 TLS (Binary) then click Edit

 <nowiki>[[File:Screenshot-Repositories.png]]</nowiki>

 Enable Universe and Multiverse :

 Then search for "qgo" and install it (it pulls one dependency)

5. In a terminal, launch
{{{
qgo}}}

Note : gdb is available on the Live CD. Other tools are available through Synaptic.

=== If you have an ADSL Internet connection ===

If you are using and USB ADSL modem, the following might or might not work. If your modem is an Ethernet one, you're on the safe side :)

To connect to Internet in Ubuntu 6.06 Dapper Drake, you have to resort to the command line.
Use {{{
sudo pppoeconf}}}

then answer the relevant questions (you'll be asked the username and the password provided by your Internet provider).

To trigger the Internet connection, use (the automatic completion helps!)
{{{
pon dsl-provider}}}

To kill the daemon {{{
sudo poff -a}}}
a few times :)
