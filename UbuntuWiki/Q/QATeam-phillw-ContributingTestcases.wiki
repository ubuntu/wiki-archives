== Contributing Testcases ==
Contributing testcases is a great way to contribute to the quality efforts for ubuntu. There are several options to choose from -- no matter if you are a programmer or just a well minded user.

==== Launchpad & bzr ====
Never contributed before? New to launchpad? Take a look at this <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QATeam/ContributingTestcases/Launchpad|tutorial]]</nowiki> for getting yourself setup for contributing testcases on launchpad.

==== Hackfests ====
We hold <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QATeam/Hackfest|hackfests]]</nowiki> online from time to time to help new and old contributors contribute tests.

=== Manual Testcases ===
We welcome new contributions as well as enhancements or corrections to the current set of cases. Follow this handy <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QATeam/ContributingTestcases/Manual|walkthrough]]</nowiki> for helping you to contribute your first manual testcase. See the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/ubuntu-manual-tests|launchpad project for manual tests]]</nowiki> to contribute or modify a manual testcase,.

==== Writing Style Guide ====
If your contributing testcases it may be helpful to check out a few pointers for <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QATeam/ContributingTestcases/ManualStyleGuide|writing your testcases]]</nowiki>.

=== Automated Testcases ===
==== Autopilot ====
We welcome new contributions as well as enhancements or corrections to the current set of cases. We are active in many different areas of ubuntu in writing cases. The major projects are broken out below.

===== Needed autopilot tests =====
To see a list of all the needed autopilot tests for you to write, <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/+bugs?field.searchtext=&field.tag=needs-autopilot-test|click here]]</nowiki>.

===== Ubuntu Desktop =====
See the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/ubuntu-autopilot-tests|launchpad project for ubuntu desktop autopilot tests]]</nowiki>. Follow this handy <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QATeam/ContributingTestcases/Autopilot|walkthrough]]</nowiki> for helping you to contribute your first autopilot testcase.

===== Ubiquity =====
We help maintain the set of autopilot tests to test ubiquity. Our goal as a team is to reduce our maintenance burden of manual testing repetitively by automating the repetitive tests via autopilot. To join in this effort, please see the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QATeam/AutomatedTesting/ubiquity|ubiquity automated testing project page]]</nowiki>.

===== Ubuntu Touch Core Apps =====
The ubuntu touch core apps are community developed applications written for the ubuntu touch platform. As a quality community team we have been assisting these developers by writing autopilot tests for the application as they have developed. For more information, including tutorials on <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Touch/CoreApps/Testing|writing autopilot tests for ubuntu touch qml applications, see the following page]]</nowiki>. In addition there is a  <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Touch/CoreApps/Testing/ContributeAutopilotTestcase|walkthrough for contributing a testcase]]</nowiki>.

==== Autopackage ====
See the <nowiki>[[http://packaging.ubuntu.com/html/auto-pkg-test.html|tutorial]]</nowiki> to get started.
