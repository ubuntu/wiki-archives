__TOC__

By default UTAH uses a preseed stored as <nowiki>[[default-preseed.cfg|-etc-utah-default-preseed.cfg]]</nowiki>  for the provisioning of the test machine. By giving a '''-p preseed_file''' input to UTAH a custom provisioning could be carried out.

For example: 
The following command would provision the test machine with quantal server image with the options given in the contents of ''preseed_file'' and run the post installation tests given in ''master.run''

<pre>
sudo -i -u utah /usr/share/utah/examples/run_utah_tests.py -i http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-server/daily/current/quantal-server-i386.iso -p /absolute_path_to/preseed-file /absolute_path_to/master.run 
</pre>

An example preseed for precise is given in <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/installation-guide/example-preseed.txt]]</nowiki>
