=== About ===

My name is Merrill but commonly known as "quietstorm" and have no preference on name. I am 45 and started my journey into open source about 10 years ago by experiementing with Red Hat 9. I quickly became frustrated and discountinued using it. My first experience with Ubuntu was with Warty Warthog and also joined Ubuntu Forums, Being a beginner and longing for more than the windows experience, I was ever so frustated with the standard "RTFM" response from the forums so yet again, I dropped from the forums and Ubuntu. I took this time to begin to find my own answers about Linux and started going to "www.linuxsurvival.com" to teach myself. This is a site that I recommend for beginners.

It's when I discovered the local users group and the their IRC channel "#Ubuntu-US-AZ" I was relieved to find great people that are more than willing to help you with Ubuntu without the annoying reference to the manual. I believe this to be the truest expression of "humanity to others" philosophy. I've learned and continue to learn that open souce software is more than "free". It's a mindset and principle of freedom. I still struggle with problem with Ubuntu but feel confident that I am not alone in learning and leaning away from my current O/S to embrace a greater freedom. Every member is my mentor and forever grateful for their contribution.

All this aside, I am a student of the University Of Phoenix majoring in information technologies. Currently on disability due to a stroke, my goal is to return to the workplace. I never cared for the label of "disabilty" let alone the implication that we are less than what we are. I enjoy movies (science fiction) and technology. In my spare time, I build, repair and maintain computer systems for the economically disadvantaged. I believe that a computer shouldn't be limited to people who can afford them. I also advocate the use of Linux in legacy systems that can be provided to econimcally disadvantaged. It's a great way to promote open source and reuse hardware that would normally be less viable in modern O/S's.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions and if I don't know the answer, I will put you in contact with the resources that will. My goal is to provide a atmosphere of trust and support while new members acclimate themselves to Ubuntu. There is no manual, just caring people and that is what makes open source work
