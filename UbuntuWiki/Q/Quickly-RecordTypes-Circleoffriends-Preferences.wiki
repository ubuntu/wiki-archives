__TOC__

This stores the access details allowing Circle Of Friends to connect to twitter using oauth. This is in two parts, firstly the Consumer Key and Secret, these were created by @alanbelltolc and belong to the application and are embedded in the source code. The second part is the Access Key and Access Secret, these get populated by the procedure when the application starts. If they are empty (strictly if the key is empty) then a web browser will be launched asking the user to log on to twitter to get a code number to be pasted back into the circle of friends application. It then connects to twitter to retrieve the access key and secret which belong to the user. These get stored and it can use them in future to read the user's stream and post tweets from the user.
Should twitter invalidate the consumer key and secret you can always create your own new one and just change the values in the preferences.
