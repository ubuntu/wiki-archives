We’re preparing  Kubuntu 12.10, the Quantal Quetzal, for distribution in October 2012. With this Alpha pre-release, you can see what we are trying out in preparation for our next version. We have some interesting things happening, so read on for highlights and information. 

'''NOTE:''' This is an alpha pre-release. 
Kubuntu Pre-releases are NOT recommended for:
* Regular users who are not aware of pre-release issues
* Anyone who needs a stable system
* Anyone uncomfortable running a possibly frequently broken system
* Anyone in a production environment with data or workflows that need to be reliable

Kubuntu Pre-releases ARE recommended for:
* Regular users who want to help us test by finding, reporting, and/or fixing bugs
* Kubuntu developers

== Getting Kubuntu 12.10 ==

=== Download a Disk Image ===
* <nowiki>[[http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/releases/quantal/alpha-3/|Bootable images for standard PCs/laptops/netbooks]]</nowiki>

Instructions for burning the image to a DVD or USB flash drive can be found on the <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BurningIsoHowto|Burning ISO Howto]]</nowiki> or <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick|Installation for USB Stick]]</nowiki>

We recommend you learn how to <nowiki>[[https://wiki.kubuntu.org/HowToMD5SUM|check your image file]]</nowiki> so your pre-release is as it’s supposed to be. Compare your MD5 checksum with the correct ones found <nowiki>[[http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/releases/quantal/alpha-3/MD5SUMS|alongside the images]]</nowiki>.

== Alpha 3 Highlights ==

=== 1GB Images ===
We're bursting out of our increasingly limited CD sizes images.  The 12.10 images will need a DVD or USB drive to install from.  This will give us  the room to ship more of the world class KDE Software.

=== KDE Plasma and Applications 4.9 Beta ===
<nowiki>[[attachment:desktop.jpg | <nowiki>[[File:desktop.jpg||width=400]]</nowiki></nowiki>]]

<nowiki>[[http://www.kde.org/announcements/announce-4.9-beta2.php|The latest testing release of KDE's Plasma Workspaces and Applications]]</nowiki> brings new features and improvements all around. Highlights include further integration of Qt Quick in plasmoids making them more attractive, easier to enhance and extend and behave better on touchscreens.  Dolphin file manager has improved its display and sorting and searching based on metadata. Deeper integration of Activities for files, windows and other resources.

=== New Software Selections ===
We are testing out some different default software selections. Please help us test them to help determine if these choices are worthy of inclusion or not.

==== Calligra Suite ====
<nowiki>[[attachment:calligra.png | <nowiki>[[File:calligra.png||width=400]]</nowiki></nowiki>]]

We are experimenting with offering the KDE Office Suite as the default in 12.10. Users are encouraged to try it out and provide feedback for this.

Calligra has the best support for reading MS Office files from any open source software.

Calligra Suite expands our offering of creativity tools to include graphics creation, and project management. Please check out
