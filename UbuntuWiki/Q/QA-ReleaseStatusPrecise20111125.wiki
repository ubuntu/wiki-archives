=== Blueprints and Status ===
* Work Item Status for Precise: http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-precise/canonical-platform-qa.html 
* Work Item Status for Alpha 1:  http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-precise/canonical-platform-qa-precise-alpha-1.html

=== What was done engineering wise? ===
* Automated testing and merging of Unity and related components.
** Automated tests are run before a branch is merged to trunk and accepted only if the tests pass. Then every commit is pushed to a PPA for users to get the latest fixes and features before it lands into the development release.
** Announce: https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-desktop/2011-November/003492.html
** Documentation: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QATeam/AutomatedTesting/UnityAutolandingSetup 
** Results: https://jenkins.qa.ubuntu.com/view/Precise%20Unity%20Merger/

* we are now keeping the last 15 days of ISO in the Lab
** This will be extended to 1 month (is it worth keeping more?) once more storage capacity comes in.

* It was getting difficult to read the public instance of Jenkins due to the amount of jobs running. To make things easier whilst the ISO dashboard is up and running, we've added this temporary page: https://jenkins.qa.ubuntu.com/view/Precise/
