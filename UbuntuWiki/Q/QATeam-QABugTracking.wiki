__TOC__

This page is meant to provide the guidelines to tag bugs depending on which part of the QA Organisation found them. This will contribute to enrich our metrics and help us focus in the right areas going forward, being able to track the bugs we raise is an important part of what QA is about, and making sure they have been fixed whenever a fix is released, just nicely closes the QA cycle. 

Also, some of those bugs will grant a test case addition, so we need to start tracking them reliably. 

* For automated testing, the Platform QA Team has a set of <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QATeam/AutomatedTesting/TestingTypeAndBugTracking|guidelines]]</nowiki> already in place. 
* For manual testing the QATracker will inform you of the tag to use and/or automatically tag your bug properly if the bug is recorded in the tracker. For example, iso testing is tagged as 'iso-testing'.
