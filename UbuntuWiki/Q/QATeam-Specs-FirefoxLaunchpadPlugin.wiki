=== Summary ===

The Firefox launchpad plugin contains some useful searches for Ubuntu bug reporters particularly the search that will get you a package's bug list. This is something that is not navigatable in Launchpad (you have to hack the url) so would be helpful for reporters to find "their" bug report. How can we get that search if not all the LP ones into the a default install of Ubuntu?

=== Release Note ===

This section should include a paragraph describing the end-user impact of this change.  It is meant to be included in the release notes of the first release in which it is implemented.  (Not all of these will actually be included in the release notes, at the release manager's discretion; but writing them is a useful exercise.)

It is mandatory.

=== Rationale ===

This should cover the _why_: why is this change being proposed, what justifies it, where we see this justified.

=== User stories ===

=== Assumptions ===

=== Design ===

You can have subsections that better describe specific parts of the issue.

=== Implementation ===

This section should describe a plan of action (the "how") to implement the changes discussed. Could include subsections like:

==== UI Changes ====

Should cover changes required to the UI, or specific UI that is required to implement this

==== Code Changes ====

Code changes should include an overview of what needs to change, and in some cases even the specific details.

==== Migration ====

Include:
* data migration, if any
* redirects from old URLs to new ones, if any
* how users will be pointed to the new way of doing things, if necessary.

=== Test/Demo Plan ===

It's important that we are able to test new features, and demonstrate them to users.  Use this section to describe a short plan that anybody can follow that demonstrates the feature is working.  This can then be used during testing, and to show off after release. Please add an entry to http://testcases.qa.ubuntu.com/Coverage/NewFeatures for tracking test coverage.

This need not be added or completed until the specification is nearing beta.

=== Unresolved issues ===

This should highlight any issues that should be addressed in further specifications, and not problems with the specification itself; since any specification with problems cannot be approved.

=== BoF agenda and discussion ===

==== Agenda ====

Possible solutions:

* Include searches, or some of them, in the ubufox package
* Have firefox-launchpad-plugin promoted to main and included in a seed

===== Notes =====
 
* It was agreed that the market for the search plugin would be very large
   subsequently including it in ubufox is unnecessary
* perhaps having ubuntu-bug open the existing bug list for the package
* the bug reporting tools should display the package bug lists or the launchpad
   duplicate finder
* report a problem could open an apport UI to guide the user to find the right
   package (not clear that is is application specific)
** if somebody reports a problem once via firefox they'll always think it is
     the right place to report problems
* maintain logic of how to find the right package in the distribution and
   not in launchpad.
* intermediate solution could be to pop up a gtk window that suggests to users
   to first go to the bug list in launchpad and search for duplicates and only
   then go to the launchpad bug report page
* _but_ launchpad report a bug page already provides a more or less smart
   duplicate suggestion list -> its not obvious how this is done technically
   and if it can be done by simply using the launchpad bug search => LP: #358505

The bug report wizard could have three pages (non-final wording, just outlining
the general workflow):

1. "You are about to report a problem against the 'Firefox' package;
    if 'Firefox' is not the package you experience your problem in
    click 'here' to find the right package; otherwise press "Next"
1a. searching by package name and once done go back to 1. (this step can
    be improved at some point by providing better guidance for finding packages
    the user doesn't directly interact with - like linux or some lib etc.)

2. "Please describe the problem in one line"
   (once the user did that the duplicate search from LP: #358505 is run and
    displayed, user can click on it to go to the launchpad bug)

3. "Did you find your bug in the list below? If so, click on the subscribe button
    next to it to track the progress of the fix; otherwise click on the report this
    problem below."
    (here the app should open launchpad +filebug page and prefill the title with
    the summary the user entered above)
