== Installation ==

=== Overview ===

Preparing your computer for Kubuntu is now much simpler, with a wider range of disk setup options. Each of these are detailed at length to provide you with a clear understanding of the actions that will take place with your selection.

You can now reinstall or upgrade an existing copy of Kubuntu with the Desktop CD installer, provided that your computer is connected to the Internet. 

=== Download ===

Kubuntu 12.10 images can be downloaded from:
** http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/releases/12.10/ (Kubuntu)
** http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu-active/releases/12.10/ (Kubuntu Active) 

=== System Requirements ===

'''TODO: please confirm Kubuntu memory requirements are accurate'''
The minimum memory requirement for Kubuntu 12.04 is 384 MB of memory for Kubuntu.   Note that some of your system's memory may be unavailable due to being used by the graphics card. If your computer has only the minimum amount of memory, the installation process will take longer than normal; however, it will complete successfully, and the system will perform adequately once installed.

Systems with less memory may be able to select "Install Kubuntu" from the boot menu to run just the installer, rather than the whole desktop, or may be able to use the alternate install CD.

== Upgrading ==

=== Upgrading from Kubuntu 12.04 ===

=== Upgrading from Other Releases ===

Users of other Kubuntu releases need to upgrade first to 12.04, and then to 12.10.
