[18:03] <marjo> Thanks sbeattie!
[18:03] <pedro_> it was a general bug day, so we created bug lists based on all the packages they're currently tracking
[18:04] <pedro_> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBugDay/20091014
[18:04] <pedro_> it turned out to be really cool, around 150 bugs were triaged
[18:04] <marjo> pedro: nice work!
[18:04] <pedro_> so thanks a lot to zul and ttx for helping us that day and for answering the questions the community had
[18:05] <pedro_> and also thanks to kamus and sbarjola for their participation
[18:05] <pedro_> I'm not planning to run a bug day for this week, since I'd like to put some more efforts into iso testing instead :-)
