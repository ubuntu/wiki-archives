== New Features in Edubuntu 12.10 ==

Edubuntu is the Ubuntu flavour for education and children, it's based on Ubuntu and integrates additional software for use at home or in the classroom.

It's produced as a DVD image that can also be converted to an USB stick and includes support for most languages by default.

=== Edubuntu Applications ===

* Stellarium has been dropped in favour of Kstars. Stellarium has big OpenGL demands that are hard to meet on ARM devices.

* Tomboy has been re-introduced as the default note-taking application.

* Language packs have now been moved off from the live image to a pool on the disc. This greatly improves install times at the cost of using more RAM in a live session when a local language is specified.

* A new package called 'edubuntu-netboot' is introduced. This package now provides the functionality previously provided by ltsp-live and will also be used for casper-netboot.

* Certain packages which are default in Ubuntu aren't installed in Edubuntu. These are avoided during installation, but due to current technical limits, can't be avoided during upgrades and may have to be manually removed after an upgrade. These packages include: icoutils, qt3-assistant, unity-lens-shopping and virtuoso-minimal. These can be removed using the Software Centre or by using "sudo apt-get remove icoutils qt3-assistant unity-lens-shopping virtuoso-minimal" from a terminal

* Nepomuk and Akonadi icons are now hidden from menus.

* The wallpaper selection has been updated.

* Although no ARM release is made for Edubuntu 12.10, test builds have been done daily to ensure Edubuntu packages work on ARM. If you are running Ubuntu 12.10 on ARM, you may install the Edubuntu educational packages from the Software Center.

== Installation ==

=== Overview ===

Preparing your computer for Edubuntu is now much simpler, with a wider range of disk setup options. Each of these are detailed at length to provide you with a clear understanding of the actions that will take place with your selection.

You can now reinstall or upgrade an existing copy of Edubuntu with the DVD installer, provided that your computer is connected to the Internet. 

=== Download ===

Edubuntu 12.10 images can be downloaded from:
** http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/edubuntu/releases/12.10/release/ (official source)
** http://www.stgraber.org/download/releases/edubuntu/12.10/ (mirror)

=== System Requirements ===

The minimum memory requirement for Edubuntu 12.10 is 512 MB of memory but 1024 MB is highly recommended.
Note that some of your system's memory may be unavailable due to being used by the graphics card. If your computer has only the minimum amount of memory, the installation process will take longer than normal; however, it will complete successfully, and the system will perform adequately once installed.

It's recommended to use the i386 image for computers with less than 1GB of memory. For these systems, installing using the "Install Edubuntu" option from the DVD boot menu will also be faster as it'll save some memory (compared to the "Try Edubuntu without installing" option).

When using Edubuntu 12.10 as an LTSP server, you should plan at least an additional 256 MB per client.

The Edubuntu 12.10 installation image does not include support for old computers that do not support PAE. 

== Upgrading ==
=== Upgrading from Edubuntu 12.04 ===

To upgrade from Edubuntu 12.04 on a desktop system, press Alt+F2 and type in "update-manager -d" (without the quotes) into the command box. Update Manager should open up and display following message: "New distribution release '12.10' is available. Click Upgrade and follow the on-screen instructions". 

=== Upgrading from Other Releases ===
Users of other Edubuntu releases need to upgrade first to 12.04, and then to 12.10.

For further information on upgrading to 12.04, please see the <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PreciseUpgrades| Ubuntu Precise upgrade instructions ]]</nowiki>.

== Known Issues ==
Edubuntu being based on Ubuntu, most known issues of Ubuntu also apply to Edubuntu, below is a list of Edubuntu specific known issues and the current list of Ubuntu known issues.

=== Specific to Edubuntu ===

* Unity 2D is no longer available in 12.10. As a result, the Gnome Fallback session (also known as the "Ubuntu Classic") will now be made default when LTSP is selected. LTSP users who wish to continue using Unity-2D should remain on Edubuntu 12.04 LTS.
* In some cases, the session indicator shows up empty on LTSP. This appears to be related to the video card of the thin client. The only known workaround at this stage is to call "gnome-session-quit" manually. (Bug:1028972)

== Support ==

* Edubuntu 12.10 is supported for 18 months.
* Security and bugfix updates for Edubuntu are provided by the Edubuntu community
