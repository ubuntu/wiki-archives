==== Agenda - 2008-07-30 ====

* Bug Importance Guidelines
* Iso Testing Bug report layout.  While testing UME cgregan came up with a nice bug report template to write out reports.  I am attempting to do the same thing for Iso testing.  I think the polished our reports are the more the dev's will look to them.  (As the QATeam I also feel we should lead the way hear too). <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/kubuntu-docs/+bug/253244|Here]]</nowiki> is a Layout I've tried for the first time comments please. - davmor2
* Bugs in backport packages. Which should the policy with those be? It is clearly written that those packages are unsupported. -- AraPulido
* QA Liaison to Launchpad (LaserJock)
* <nowiki>[[http://www3.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/Research/FAUmachine/description.html|FAUMachine]]</nowiki> for installation testing (LaserJock)
