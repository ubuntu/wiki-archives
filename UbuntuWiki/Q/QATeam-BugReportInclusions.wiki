__TOC__

Everytime you report a bug it needs to be in a way that Developers can then make use of, reproduce for themselves and then hopefully fix.  You may be asked by the developers for more info but this is the minimum that should be included.

=== BASICS FOR ALL BUGS ===
1. Relevant title
** Should be as short as possible
** Should be easy to remember
** Should contain the facts you wish to put across
** '''Example''' Unable to get a 3g connection after moving away from a wifi access point
# Every bug needs the same set of basic information
## Steps to reproduce
** This needs to be a detailed set of steps, take nothing you do for granted.
** Once written follow the steps as they are written and ensure you get the expected result
1. Expected result
** This is a description of what you thought should happen, this is important as the behaviour might be correct but seems wrong to you.
1. Actual result
** The result you actually get and how it differs from your expected result
1. Versioning info of the system
** Versioning is really important, at any time there are 2-3 versions of Ubuntu being maintained knowing which you are on is therefore critical

phablet shell
system-image-cli -i
</pre>
