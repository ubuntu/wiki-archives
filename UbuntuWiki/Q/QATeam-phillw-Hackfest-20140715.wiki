=== Summary ===

This <nowiki>[[QATeam-Hackfest|Hackfest]]</nowiki> will focus on cleaning up the remaining outstanding bugs for our manual testcases, as well as cleaning up and hacking on the toolkit helper and ubuntu touch core apps!

Don't forget to checkout the guides on preparing yourself and machine for contributing tests! Please make sure your system is setup to push code to launchpad:

https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QATeam/ContributingTestcases/Launchpad

And for manual tests, have a read of:

https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QATeam/ManualTestingHackfest

=== Manual testcases ===
'''Bugs to hack on''': 
<nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-manual-tests/+bugs?field.tag=bitesize|Bitesize bugs]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-manual-tests/+bugs?field.tag=edubuntu| Edubuntu]]</nowiki>

Instructions: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QATeam/ContributingTestcases/Manual

Format: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/TestCaseFormat#contribute

Format Checker: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QATeam/ContributingTestcases/ManualStyleGuide/test_case_format_script

Style Guide: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QATeam/ContributingTestcases/ManualStyleGuide

'''Edubuntu note''' some of the packages that testcases needed to be written for will pull in kde libs, if you do not want to pull them into the install you are working with, think about running a virtual machine to install 

Requirements: Utopic installed (a virtual machine works fine!).

=== Ubuntu UI Toolkit Autopilot Helper ===
'''Bugs to hack on''': https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-ui-toolkit/+bugs?field.tag=autopilot-helper

Leo's notes: http://pad.ubuntu.com/contributing-toolkit-helpers

Requirements: Utopic installed (a virtual machine works fine!), python-autopilot, ubuntu-ui-toolkit-autopilot and ubuntu-sdk installed

Thanks for helping!

What's that you say? Our targets aren't good enough and you want to work on actual automated tests?

In that case, might we recommend the core apps.
