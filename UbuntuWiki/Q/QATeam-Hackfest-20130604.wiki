This week's <nowiki>[[QATeam-Hackfest|Hackfest]]</nowiki> will focus on '''manual and automated tests'''! Specifically we want to accomplish the following goals:

# Finish migration of all the ubuntu-autopilot-tests testcases to autopilot 1.3
## A pad has been setup to help follow progress: http://pad.ubuntu.com/CFXkuLR7Lb
# Review and expand manual testcases in preparation for cadence testing
# Hack on ubiquity to perform automated image tests using autopilot
