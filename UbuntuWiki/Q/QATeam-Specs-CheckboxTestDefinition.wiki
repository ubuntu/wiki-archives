=== Summary ===
The way tests are defined in checkbox needs to be reviewed and refined to cover the following scenarios:

* multi-part tests
* alternative test
* expected answers (e.g. no == pass)
* answer phrasing (e.g. "I don't know" == skip)

=== Rationale ===

This should cover the _why_: why is this change being proposed, what justifies it, where we see this justified.

=== Use Cases ===

=== Assumptions ===

=== Design ===

You can have subsections that better describe specific parts of the issue.

=== Implementation ===

This section should describe a plan of action (the "how") to implement the changes discussed. Could include subsections like:

==== UI Changes ====

Should cover changes required to the UI, or specific UI that is required to implement this

==== Code Changes ====

Code changes should include an overview of what needs to change, and in some cases even the specific details.

==== Migration ====

Include:
* data migration, if any
* redirects from old URLs to new ones, if any
* how users will be pointed to the new way of doing things, if necessary.

=== Test/Demo Plan ===

It's important that we are able to test new features, and demonstrate them to users.  Use this section to describe a short plan that anybody can follow that demonstrates the feature is working.  This can then be used during testing, and to show off after release. Please add an entry to http://testcases.qa.ubuntu.com/Coverage/NewFeatures for tracking test coverage.

This need not be added or completed until the specification is nearing beta.

=== Unresolved issues ===

This should highlight any issues that should be addressed in further specifications, and not problems with the specification itself; since any specification with problems cannot be approved.

=== BoF agenda and discussion ===

Existing fields:

Required
* name - utf-8
* plugin (to be "type") - a-z\w*, ne.I
* description - multi line

Optional
* command - multi line
* depends - !?name([_]+name)*
* requires (to be "run_if") - python-ish boolean exp/multi-exp
* timeout - \d+
* optional - true|false|0|1
* architecture - i386|amd
* category - desktop|server

== Actions ==
* Create a way for checkbox to be forced to run all the tests regardless of depends
* Have ERROR result statuses
