=== Ubuntu 12.10, 13.04 and 13.10 ===

Qreator is not yet available in the Software Center for Ubuntu 12.10, 13.04 or 13.10 but will be coming very soon!

In the meantime, you can add one of the qreator PPAs to your repository and install it from there. There is the PPA with the stable version:

'''ppa:qreator-hackers/qreator-stable'''

and for the more adventurous, the version created from our daily changes:

'''ppa:qreator-hackers/qreator-daily'''

=== Ubuntu 12.04 ===

You can install Qreator from the Ubuntu Software Centre. Either:

* Click on this link: apt://qreator, or

* Simply search for 'qreator' on the Software Centre and install the matching result.
