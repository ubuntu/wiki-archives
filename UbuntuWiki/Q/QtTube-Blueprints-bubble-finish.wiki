=== Overview ===

It should be possible to let QtTube display a notification bubble when a download finishes.

<nowiki>[[https://blueprints.launchpad.net/qttube/+spec/bubble-finish|See this blueprint on Launchpad.]]</nowiki>

=== Technical Details ===

The result with Qt4's <nowiki>[[http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/Docs/PyQt4/html/qsystemtrayicon.html|QSystemTrayIcon]]</nowiki>'s <nowiki>[[http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/Docs/PyQt4/html/qsystemtrayicon.html#showMessage|showMessage]]</nowiki> function is rather suboptimal (in both, appearance and display location).

Because of that, it has been decided to make use of pynotify. If it isn't available, notifications will be disabled and an informational message will be displayed on the Preferences window.
