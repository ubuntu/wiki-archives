This week's <nowiki>[[QATeam-Hackfest|Hackfest]]</nowiki> will focus on '''manual and automated tests'''! Specifically we want to accomplish the following goals:

# Re-organize the ubuntu-autopilot-tests trunk so known good tests are separated from those that are a work in progress
# Complete review of the manual testcases and bugs in ubuntu-manual-tests
# Migrate all the ubuntu-autopilot-tests testcases to autopilot 1.3
# Clean up the old autopilot documentation and resource links from autopilot 1.2 to autopilot 1.3

A pad has been setup to help follow progress: http://pad.ubuntu.com/CFXkuLR7Lb
