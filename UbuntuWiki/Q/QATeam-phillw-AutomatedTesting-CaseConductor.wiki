__TOC__

'''Case Conductor''' is the new test case management tool the mozilla team are putting together to do community testing and to substitute litmus. The project is being tracked with <nowiki>[[https://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/280483|pivotaltracker]]</nowiki>. 

The tool will be available by Q1 2012. They are undergoing a re-architecture at the moment and are moving to use Django for the front end. 

IRC Channels to talk to the Case Conductor team: #caseconductor and #qa in irc.mozilla.org.
