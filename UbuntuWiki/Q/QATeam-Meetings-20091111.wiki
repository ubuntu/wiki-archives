[17:18] <pedro_> noup just a quick question
[17:19] <ara> pedro_, yes?
[17:19] <pedro_> regarding the uds schedule, do you know why the sessions don't appear on http://summit.ubuntu.com/uds-l/track/qa/
[17:20] <pedro_> but they do on the daily ones
[17:20] <ara> pedro_, I think per track is broken in the summit site

[17:20] <pedro_> i'm a bit confuse about that
[17:21] <ara> I will ask jono again and will send an email about to ubuntu-qa
[17:22] <pedro_> ah might be that, not really important though just a little doubt
[17:22] <pedro_> ara, awesome, thank you
