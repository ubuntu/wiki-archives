<jibel> Thanks to all the contributors who helped testing Alpha2
 On the ISO Testing side, next week we will be testing Lucid 10.04.2
 and 2 weeks after it will be Natty Alpha3.
<patrickmw> and thank you jibel for managing the iso testing process
<jibel> That's all for me.
<patrickmw> [TOPIC] TestLink update -- patrickmw
<Mootbot-UK> New Topic:  TestLink update -- patrickmw
<patrickmw> quick summary
 managing our test suites in wiki format is a pain
 so we've been researching tools to help us manage our tests better
 teamst.org is TestLink's official site
 hggdh was kind enough to let me borrow a server to do prototype testing on
 I have started installing it this morning and when I'm done I will send an announcement and make sure those interested have accounts
 any questions on that?
