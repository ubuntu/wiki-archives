Curious as to how effective the guided bug filing instructions are I took 3904 bugs with "New" in the e-mail subject from the ubuntu-bugs mailing list dated from 2008-01-25 to 2008-02-15.  These e-mails are only the initial description of the bug.  I've discovered the following so far:

*** queried mailing list for subject NEW and date "25/01/2008-15/02/2008"
*** 283 of these were apport-bug reports
*** limit =b "ProblemType: Bug" - 283
*** limit =b "apport-bug" - 265
**** Tags didn't show up for some reason in 18 of these
*** 271 of these were apport-crash reports
*** limit =b "ProblemType: Crash" - 271
*** limit =b "apport-crash" - 270
*** 125 of these were failure to install / upgrade a package
*** limit =b "ProblemType: Package"
*** 699 without a package specified
*** limit =h "distribution=ubuntu; sourcepackage=None"
*** 190 with some info found in /etc/lsb-release
*** limit =b "DISTRIB_ID"
*** 47 with some info from dpkg output in them
*** limit =b "+++-===" 
*** 75 with some info from dpkg output in them
*** limit =b "dpkg -l" 
*** 31 with some info from dpkg output in them
*** limit =b "ii  " !b="dpkg -l"
*** 181 were submitted via e-mail 
*** limit !~h "Message-Id.*malonedeb" - need ~ for regex
*** 341 were sync requests 
*** limit =s "Please sync"
*** 54 bugs about something needing packaging
*** limit =s "needs-packaging"
*** 2065 about packages in main
*** limit ~h "distribution=ubuntu.*component=main"
*** 989 about packages in universe
*** limit ~h "distribution=ubuntu.*component=universe"
*** 87 about packages in multiverse
*** limit ~h "distribution=ubuntu.*component=multiverse"
*** 20 about packages in restricted
*** limit ~h "distribution=ubuntu.*component=restricted"
*** 50 with component=None and !sourcepackage=None
***** linux-source-2.6.x has no component
***** multiple tasks got counted in here too
***** restricted-manager has no component
***** this is caused by Malone bug 196783

I did a second sampling from February 16th to March 20th.  The guided bug filing instructions were asking for 'cat /etc/lsb-release' and 'apt-cache policy'.

*** 7456 New bugs from Feb 16 to Mar 20
*** queried mailing list for subject NEW and date "16/02/2008-20/03/2008"
*** 567 of these were report a problem reports
*** 567 limit =b "ProblemType: Bug"
*** 538 limit =b "apport-bug"
**** 21 Feisty users
**** 6 Gutsy users
**** 1 tag editor
*** 621 of these were *public* crash reports
*** 624 limit =b "ProblemType: Crash"
*** 620 limit =b "apport-crash"
**** difference was from one person adding other tags (dropping apport-crash), some Feisty apport crashes, and somebody with a horked version of apport
*** 177 were package upgrade issues
*** 177 limit =b "ProblemType: Package"
*** 174 limit =b "apport-package"
**** difference due to people running Feisty
*** 56 needs-packaging bugs
*** 44 limit =s "needs-packaging"
*** 56 limit =b "needs-packaging"
*** 533 with the string "DISTRIB_ID"
*** limit =b "DISTRIB_ID"
*** 152 with some dpkg output
*** 88 limit =b "dpkg -l"
*** +15 limit =b "+++-===" !=b "dpkg -l" 
*** +49 limit =b "ii  " !=b "+++-===" !=b "dpkg -l"
*** 196 with apt-cache policy results
*** 106 limit =b "apt-cache policy"
**** OR "grep -r -m 1 "apt-cache policy" * | wc -l"
*** 90 limit !=b "apt-cache policy" =b "  Installed: "
*** 83 submitted via e-mail
*** limit !~h "Message-Id.*malonedeb"
*** 80 of these were actually sync requests =s "Please sync"
*** 178 were sync requests
*** limit =s "Please sync"
*** 1378 of them did not have a sourcepackage
*** limit =h "sourcepackage=None"
*** 4006 were about main
*** limit =h "component=main"
*** 1677 were about universe
*** limit =h "component=universe"
*** 118 were about multiverse
*** limit =h "component=multiverse"
*** 169 had no component?
*** limit =h "component=None" !=h "sourcepackage=None" !=h "distribution=debian" !=h "distribution=baltix"
*** due to malone bug 196783
