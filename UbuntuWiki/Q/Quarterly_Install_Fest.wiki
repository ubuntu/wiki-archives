The next version of Ubuntu will be a Long Term Support version. We will be coordinating a Release Party and an Installfest at the same time. We need locations and volunteers and ideas. Please contact <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/dthomasdigital|David Thomas]]</nowiki> for more information or to help.
