== Ubuntu Quality Assurance Tracker ==
=== Global description of the idea ===
We currently have several websites for QA testing and hardware testing.
The current QA tracker is used to test ISO images and packages (mozilla), instead of reimplementing the same thing several times it'd be better to have a single
website for all kind of testing. The various development teams would then be merged to get faster and better development.
Hardware, software and images testing and certification are very similar and most features would be common to all kind of testing.

=== Use cases ===
* Ubuntu ISO testing
** User
## See a list of available ISO images for testing
## Choose an image and find the download links
## Get a list of testcases for this image (or a single one if decided by the QA team)
## Go through all points of that testcase and valid or invalid each points
** Get an overview of all images being tested and their status
** Get the list of all people assigned to testcases and whether or not they are QA members
** Receive e-mail notification when new builds are uploaded or when they are marked as invalid
** QA Admin
** Add new images to sync from cdimage or another server
** Manage the testcases list
** Batch subscribe users to a testcase or e-mail notification
** Release manager
** Mark images as broken
** Force add/remove images that aren't auto-synced (DVD images for example)

* Ubuntu SRU (stable release update) and security updates testing
** User
## Have a list of packages needing tested for SRU
## Download the package from -proposed or a PPA
## Get the testcase(s) for the package
## Make sure the bugs are fixed in the package and no regression exist
## Submit the result to the tracker
** Get an overview of all packages being tested and their status
** Get the list of all people assigned to testcases and whether or not they are QA members
** Get notified by e-mail when new packages need testing
** Security team member
## Have a list of packages needing testing for security updates
## Download the package from an internal website
## Get the testcase
## Make sure the security issue is fixed and no regression exists
## Submit the result to the tracker
** Get an overview of all packages being tested and their status
** Get the list of all people assigned to testcases and whether or not they are QA members
** Get notified by e-mail when new packages need testing
** QA Admin
** Add new packages or group of packages and assign a QA responsible for them
** Manage the testcases list
** Batch subscribe users to a testcase or e-mail notification

* Hardware certification '''Marc Tardif should fill that section'''
* Hardware testing (Ubuntu Mobile and Embeded, Classmate PC, ...) '''Ubuntu Mobile and Classmate developers should fill that section'''

=== Features ===
* E-mail notification
* Linked to Launchpad for bug filing, team membership and login
* Public and Private sections
* Easy to get new testcases from various sources (PPA, cdimage.ubuntu.com)
* Build (package, ISO, hardware image) -> Testcases -> Detailed testcase -> Result
* Easy subscription to testing
* Entirely web manageable (no manual SQL changes required)
* Report and statistics generation for release to release testing progress statistics
* Have a central hardware database instead of the two (or three) we currently have.
