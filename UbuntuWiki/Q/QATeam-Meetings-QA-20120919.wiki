 14:00:54 <smartboyhw> \o

 14:01:03 <phillw> \o

 14:01:06 <balloons> \o

 14:02:08 <smartboyhw> Oh sorry:)

 14:02:29 <xnox> \o

 14:02:59 <balloons> alright, we shall dive into the agenda

 14:03:11 <smartboyhw> :)

 14:03:21 <balloons> [TOPIC] Previous Actions

 14:03:40 * balloons balloons to follow-up with ubuntu-qa website changes

 14:04:09 <balloons> I actually have news on this. We can change the theme in launchpad, and the admin will redploy

 14:04:10 <njin> \ï¿½

 14:04:21 <smartboyhw> Yeah

 14:04:32 <balloons> sadly I can't get the update I want for wordpress, but this will still work

 14:04:50 <balloons> It's on my to-do list, but volunteers are welcome to pitch in here

 14:05:03 <smartboyhw> wordpress?

 14:05:09 <balloons> need to be able to use lp and bzr.. the change is basic html

 14:05:13 <smartboyhw> I donÂ´t understand balloons

 14:05:42 <balloons> smartboyhw, wordpress is a the engine running the site

 14:05:52 <smartboyhw> OK I get it

 14:05:57 <smartboyhw> phillw can do that I think

 14:05:59 * balloons balloons to fix regex on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QATeam/Meetings

 14:06:05 * smartboyhw is not using any ubuntu system for now...

 14:06:12 <balloons> That's done, regex is all fixed up now

 14:06:21 <phillw> i saw, thanks :)

 14:06:26 <balloons> I believe that's it for previous actions

 14:06:28 <smartboyhw> Thx

 14:06:28 <balloons> anything else?

 14:07:12 <TheLordOfTime> \o

 14:07:14 <TheLordOfTime> (late attendance)

 14:07:24 <smartboyhw> ThatÂ´s a lot of people today

 14:07:40 <balloons> ok, moving on to more exciting things

 14:07:51 <smartboyhw> :)

 14:07:52 <balloons> [TOPIC]  Ubuntu Updates

 14:08:17 <balloons> the big excitement this week is the testcase work going on

 14:08:17 <smartboyhw> Is it that Beta 2 Freeze and DocumentationStringFreeze is tmr?

 14:08:23 <balloons> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QATeam/QuantalTestcaseUpdates

 14:09:54 <balloons> the goal is to have the testcases for flavors and other leftover tests all pushed into the tracker this week

 14:10:08 <balloons> in support of the efforts, a new version of the tracker with some nice improvements is also landing

 14:10:59 <balloons> it will have collapsible testcases, date filtering for reports, and will allow us to use variables in our testcases to support multiple flavors better

 14:11:37 <balloons> beta2 testing will be next week, and as mentioned, the doc and string freeze along with beta2 freeze is happening tomorrow

 14:12:12 <balloons> I would expect the first candidate images this Friday/Monday for beta2 as usual

 14:12:37 <balloons> after the beta2 release, the RC (and testing!) comes quickly so get ready

 14:13:09 <balloons> Also, I sent some things to the list about new stuff landing in quantal

 14:13:46 <balloons> new dash's, new beta drivers for graphics and some other things.. read the archives if your interested in seeing what's still trickling in :-)

 14:13:47 <balloons> any questions or further comments on what's going on in ubuntu?

 14:14:23 <smartboyhw> len-dt: \o

 14:14:27 <smartboyhw> Sorry

 14:14:39 <smartboyhw> I want to \o and accidentally pinged one of the Studio guys

 14:14:45 <smartboyhw> balloons: Have question

 14:14:50 <balloons> smartboyhw, go ahead

 14:15:14 <smartboyhw> Migration of legacy testcases to isotracker testcases

 14:16:06 <smartboyhw> Does that mean only changing words which are Â¨UbuntuÂ¨ or Â¨XubuntuÂ¨ to like Â¨Ubuntu StudioÂ¨?

 14:16:37 <smartboyhw> ..

 14:16:37 <balloons> smartboyhw, no you don't need to change the testcase for something so simple

 14:16:55 <smartboyhw> balloons: So what exactly does Migration of legacy testcases to isotracker testcases mean?

 14:16:58 <balloons> the new version of the tracker is allowing us to use a variable to replace the 'ubuntu' string

 14:17:22 <balloons> so what you can do is simply create a testsuite for ubuntu studio, and assign the needed testcases to it

 14:17:38 <balloons> let's take a look quickly as an example

 14:17:38 <smartboyhw> Ah that is easy, so I do it in the sandbox?

 14:18:00 <balloons> so ubuntu studio only releases dvd's

 14:18:05 <balloons> and there are 2 testcases

 14:18:06 <smartboyhw> Yes only

 14:18:12 <smartboyhw> Uh huh

 14:18:15 <balloons> you need to create a testsuite and add those 2 testcases to it

 14:18:26 <smartboyhw> In sandbox or real ISO tracker?

 14:18:34 <balloons> then I'll assign the testsuite to ubuntu studio and you'll be set

 14:18:45 <balloons> you'll need to do it on prod, obviously, once your ready

 14:18:57 * smartboyhw now goes doing it

 14:19:07 <balloons> ok, anything else?

 14:19:32 <balloons> [TOPIC] Other topics

 14:19:46 <balloons> Ok, we do have a few items to discuss under other topics

 14:20:07 <balloons> First up is the update-manager bug -- https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/update-manager/+bug/1046563

 14:20:08 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1046563 in update-manager (Ubuntu) "update-manager never appears on lubuntu precise" [Undecided,Confirmed]

 14:20:35 <balloons> I've seen the bug firsthand. We'll need to chat with michael voigt or someone else who understands the update-manager in more detail

 14:21:08 <phillw> thanks, it is an issue if peoplel are not getting things like security updates.

 14:21:14 <balloons> if anyone is familar with python, I don't think debugging it would be *that* hard.. I have played around with it before, but sadly I don't know any specific debugging techniques

 14:21:42 <balloons> phillw, ohh.. yes, look, it affects precise

 14:22:10 <balloons> I didn't realize that

 14:22:28 <phillw> yeah, after putting in 12.04.1 stuff on.

 14:22:28 <balloons> in that case, I would push it up through lubuntu channels to your security contacts if possible

 14:23:06 <phillw> Julien is on a well earned vacation, so we're a bit on the ground a.t.m.

 14:23:15 <phillw> *bit thin*

 14:23:23 <balloons> if we can confirm it's that serious and affecting precise, I'll work with your right after this to push it harder

 14:23:34 * balloons thought it was a quantal bug

 14:23:46 <phillw> no such luck :(

 14:23:50 <balloons> [TOPIC] Power PC fail to build

 14:24:05 <bikefridaywalter> yay :(

 14:24:16 <smartboyhw> ...

 14:24:18 <phillw> o/

 14:24:20 <balloons> ok, so I've heard some success and some failure, but there certainly are some powerpc bugs affecting some lubuntu users

 14:24:23 <balloons> phillw, go ahead

 14:25:58 <phillw> Adam has spent quite some time herding bugs into some sort of reason so that they can be followed. As I only got that email about 6 hours ago, I've replied asking him to give some additional guidance to the L-QA ppc testers.

 14:26:23 <phillw> you will see his name crawling on the bugs.

 14:26:38 <phillw> (ojordan)

 14:27:07 <bikefridaywalter> of course with oversized images that makes for certain difficulties: (

 14:27:08 <balloons> yes, I too heard from Adam

 14:27:30 <balloons> on the oversized images issue, yea, it's common during the cycle

 14:27:41 <balloons> I simply use usb nowadays

 14:27:50 <balloons> I understand ppc is a bit trickier

 14:28:10 <phillw> bikefridaywalter: as I replied in the mailing list, the issue is discussed on the PPC-FAQ area. let me get the link for you.

 14:28:37 <phillw> bikefridaywalter: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PowerPCFAQ

 14:28:59 <bikefridaywalter> it is very unreliable with openfirmware. i have tried for years to make it work right with no success

 14:29:13 <phillw> both how to shrink an iso, and how to get usb to work.

 14:30:09 <bikefridaywalter> the usb is not 100% with that or any process but ill try shrinking

 14:30:34 <phillw> bikefridaywalter: it is certainly worth a try, those were the suggestions from Adam.

 14:31:33 <phillw> I'll be sending an email to L-QA about the areas that Adam raised with me.

 14:31:46 <phillw> ..

 14:31:55 <balloons> thank you phillw and bikefridaywalter

 14:32:17 <balloons> [TOPIC] Testcase Admins Team sandbox and mailing list discussion

 14:32:32 <balloons> ok, smartboyhw requested we bring up the idea of another mailing list for the admin team

 14:32:59 <balloons> fyi for others; https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/TestCaseAdmins

 14:33:18 <phillw> o/

 14:33:44 <balloons> go ahead phillw

 14:35:24 <phillw> is the test case admin team expected to generate so much mail? I'd think something similar that is used my L-QA, where PPC has PPC in the subject line so those not interested don't need to read it and use our current QA mailing list so any one interested in test cases can see what & where we are upto.

 14:35:33 <phillw> s/my/by

 14:36:59 <balloons> phillw, I agree.. I'd really rather avoid specific mailing lists for things

 14:37:07 <smartboyhw> Agree!

 14:37:18 <balloons> njin, smartboyhw, elfy thoughts/

 14:37:32 <smartboyhw> \o

 14:38:00 <elfy> extra m/l seems a bit like just having a m/l so there's a m/l - I'd concur with phillw's thoughts

 14:38:11 <njin> balloons, we have a new hard tester, sandra farnedi is back

 14:39:09 <balloons> ok, sounds like we'll keep things as is.. If you need to get in touch, use the ubuntu-qa mailing list and consider putting a [testcase-admin] header in the subject line

 14:39:18 <smartboyhw> OK:)

 14:39:22 <smartboyhw> \o

 14:39:42 <balloons> ok, that's all we have for scheduled topics.. feel free to raise anything additional now

 14:39:58 <smartboyhw> \o

 14:40:02 <balloons> njin, go ahead -- who is this new tester

 14:40:05 <balloons> one sec smartboyhw

 14:40:10 <smartboyhw> Sorry

 14:42:18 <njin> She's sandra, https://launchpad.net/~sandra-farnedi-d

 14:43:07 <balloons> njin, excellent

 14:43:16 <balloons> I assume you'll get her up to speed :-)

 14:43:21 <balloons> go ahead smartboyhw

 14:43:24 <njin> she was a teacher

 14:45:16 <njin> https://bugs.launchpad.net/~sandra-farnedi-d/+reportedbugs

 14:45:52 <smartboyhw> OK my turn

 14:46:17 <smartboyhw> Been a bit worried in https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QATeam/QuantalTestcaseUpdates

 14:46:41 <smartboyhw> balloons: When is the deadline for distro specific testcases?

 14:47:04 <balloons> smartboyhw, no deadline.. just future work on that

 14:47:04 <smartboyhw> ..

 14:47:13 <balloons> it's up to the flavors if they want to do it at all

 14:47:25 <balloons> I don't drive your schedules :-)

 14:48:27 <balloons> ok, anyone else have anything they wish to ask or bring up?

 14:48:34 <balloons> a question, comment, etc? :-)

 14:49:23 <smartboyhw> balloons\o

 14:49:27 <smartboyhw> One more questino

 14:49:31 <smartboyhw> *question

 14:49:58 <balloons> go ahead smartboyhw

 14:50:14 <smartboyhw> Back in https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QATeam/QuantalTestcaseUpdates

 14:50:25 <smartboyhw> As I recall Mythbuntu is an LTS->LTS release.

 14:50:51 <smartboyhw> So balloons you may just go and delete the item for ISOTracker testcase for Mythbuntu in Beta 2 secion

 14:50:54 <smartboyhw> *section

 14:51:40 <smartboyhw> ..

 14:52:03 <balloons> thanks smartboyhw
