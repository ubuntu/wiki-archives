__TOC__

I'm relatively new to the Linux world but I learn quickly. My main motivation was the ease of use of today's Linux distros. Back in 1998 I glanced at Linux but I was put off because, honestly, it couldn't do much for an average computer user like myself. But the <nowiki>[[http://www.knoppix.com/|Knoppix LiveCD]]</nowiki> converted me and now I use Xubuntu exclusively. I do what I can to switch as many people as I can over to the Penguin side. I'm always in learning mode no matter where I am.
