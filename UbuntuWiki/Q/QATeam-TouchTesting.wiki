== Testing Ubuntu Touch ==
Welcome! This page contains the information you need to know to test ubuntu touch. Follow the steps outlined to keep your device updated and your testing relevant.

=== Setup ===
You should subscribe to the phone mailing list, and keep in mind the following IRC channels for help.

* '''Mailing Lists''' - The <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-phone|ubuntu phone mailing list]]</nowiki> provides constant updates about what is happening on the phone images.
* '''IRC''' - join the Ubuntu QA in `#ubuntu-quality` and and Ubuntu Touch `#ubuntu-touch` IRC channels on freenode if you need realtime help.

You also need to flash your phablet device with the latest proposed image.

==== Install the current development image ====
Flash your phone to the latest proposed image. If you have not yet bootstrapped or unlocked your phone's bootloader, <nowiki>[[http://developer.ubuntu.com/start/ubuntu-for-devices/installing-ubuntu-for-devices/|see the install page for more information]]</nowiki>. 

To test with the proposed image:
<pre>
  $ ubuntu-device-flash  --channel=devel-proposed
</pre>

=== Test process ===
This describes the daily process of testing. We will flash our devices, read what's changed, and look for bugs.

=== Step 1: Update ===
You need a phone or tablet with the latest development proposed image. If needed, install the current development image now by flashing or using the OTA update feature.

==== Perform a system update ====
Once you are running the ubuntu image you may perform a system update from the device itself. The images now prompt and even autoupdate if allowed. To manually update, select the 'system-settings' application, then click update. Once the download completes, press the install and restart button.

=== Step 2: Check to see what's changed ===
'''This step is optional.''' A list of changes between stable images can be <nowiki>[[http://people.canonical.com/~lzemczak/landing-team/|found here]]</nowiki>. The list contains the list of changing packages.

Use these changes to help you understand what is new so you can check it for bugs.

=== Step 3: Test ===
* Run through the list of new features and changed areas of the phone, paying specific attention to spot regressions and verify the features are working.

* Use the device as you normally would as you go about daily activities.

* Remember this is exploratory testing, so try and break things!

=== Step 4: Report Bugs ===
Report any bugs you found while testing. See the <nowiki>[[QATeam-TouchTesting-BugReporting|Reporting a Bug page]]</nowiki> for details.

=== Step 5: Review Bugs ===
'''This step is optional.''' Review bugs found. If you did not find a new bug, seek to confirm existing bugs via triaging. You can also flag bugs as good candidates for tests to prevent future regressions.

==== Confirm an existing bug ====
Not finding any bugs yourself? Look at <nowiki>[[QATeam-TouchTesting-BugReporting#Triaging|Triaging]]</nowiki> and confirm bugs others have found.

==== Add a testcase for reported bugs ====
Once testing is completed, review the list of reported bugs with the <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/+bugs?field.tag=touch-needs-autopilot| touch-needs-autopilot tag]]</nowiki>. Pick a testcase to <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Touch/CoreApps/Testing/ContributeAutopilotTestcase|automate using autopilot]]</nowiki> that tests the bug to ensure the same bug doesn't reappear. So we can track work happening on these bugs, follow this process while writing the test; 

# Remove the '''touch-needs-autopilot''' tag from the original bug
# Open a new bug against the same project, tagged with '''qa-touch-automated'''
# Assign yourself to the bug and update progress as usual. When you release the test, close the bug with fix released.
