For specific packages it is more efficient to contact the maintainer of the package directly. Here are a few ways to find when a specific version have been uploaded and find the changelog:

* Which version of a package is available:
** $ rmadison <package>

* Publishing information: 
** https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/<package>/+publishinghistory

* Changelog from the command line:
** $ apt-get changelog <package>

* Changelog from launchpad:
** https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/<release codename>/+source/<package>/+changelog
** https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/<package>/+changelog for everything

These links are available from the package page on launchpad.

* When an image is not available while it should be, the following links contains useful information:
** http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/livefs-build-logs/
** http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/cd-build-logs/
