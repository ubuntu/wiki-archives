__TOC__


This page details information for hackfests. A hackfest is a gathering of interested contributors with the goal of contributing new testcases as well as fixing and enhancing existing testcases. Testcases are generally targeted for each hackfest, but all contributions are welcome. Members from the quality team make themselves available during the fests to help streamline contributions. Additional hackfests on specific areas are also held.
