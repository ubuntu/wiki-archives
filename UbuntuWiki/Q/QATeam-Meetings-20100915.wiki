<ameetp> twice...

<cr3> whip it, whip it good
<ameetp> alright.  jibel thank you!!
<pedro_> lol
<ameetp> [Topic] Bug Day status -- pedro_
<Mootbot-UK> New Topic:  Bug Day status -- pedro_
<pedro_> Hola, so last Thursday we had a bug day for Apt which was organized with help of charlie-tca
<pedro_> the participation was good, 99 bugs were triaged that day
<pedro_> Thanks a lot to our rocking contributors: kamusin, charlie-tca, vish, adam-collard, devildante, ris and yofel
<pedro_> per the action item of previous meeting we ran a bug day for upgrades yesterday
<pedro_> but looks like we didn't have a lot of participation
<pedro_> not sure why, jibel do you have any thoughts on that?
<jibel> because it was organized on a tuesday ?
<ara> I guess upgrade bugs are a bit harder to triage?
<charlie-tca> +1
<ara> jibel, wouldn't you like to organize a session on how to triage upgrade bugs next ubuntu dev week?
<pedro_> yeah i think you're both right
<pedro_> ara, that'd be awesome to have, jibel please please please ?
<jibel> ara, I think you are right. but the u-m bugs only needed to be confirmed or reproduced
<charlie-tca> I think many think of doing installs to reproduce an "upgrade"
<ara> jibel, but, how do you reproduce a bug that might involve having a strange combination of packages?
* ara is talking without knowing much, just to start the conversation
<pedro_> charlie-tca, yeah but i thought we were going to have more participation due that the previous was about apt which is totally connected to u-m/n
<jibel> The bugs list was about failures in maverick.
<jibel> so no really combination of packages.
<pedro_> ok let's try to fix that for the next time :-)
<ameetp> pedro_, jibel:  do you want an action item to "organize a session on how to triage upgrade bugs next ubuntu dev week"?
<jibel> for example we see from that list that fglrx, blcr, and other kernel modules doesn't build in maverick.
<charlie-tca> I don't think the list was looked at, tbh. People think of upgrade as meaning they have to install an old version first. We need to explain better, maybe?
<pedro_> ameetp, that'd be nice to have , yes please
<ameetp> based on charlie-tca comments maybe we need more education on this..
<pedro_> charlie-tca, agreed
<ameetp> [ACTION]  "organize a session on how to triage upgrade bugs next ubuntu dev week"
<Mootbot-UK> ACTION received:   "organize a session on how to triage upgrade bugs next ubuntu dev week"
<pedro_> alright since tomorrow is Thursday, we have another bug day planned
<pedro_> which was also proposed by charlie-tca, the target for tomorrow is Brasero
<pedro_>  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBugDay/20100916
<pedro_> there's plenty of bugs waiting to be triaged so if you have some time and want to learn more about bug triage and Brasero, please join us tomorrow at #ubuntu-bugs
<pedro_> if you don't have too much time to participate but you'd like to do some testing, please help us to test the latest Brasero on Maverick
<pedro_> and file bugs if the application is not working correctly for you
<ameetp> thanks pedro_!  Anything else for us?
<pedro_> ameetp, that's all from here unless there's a question/comment
<bladernr_> Seems to me brasero bugs will also require a media investment
<bladernr_> all the bugs I ever filed against it were due to burn failures :(
* Hoaas (~hoaas@84-16-209.201.3p.ntebredband.no) has joined #ubuntu-quality
<ara> bladernr_, some of them are related to the interface or file management, so you can collaborate without expending a CD
<bladernr_> ara:  ack... just commenting on my own experience
<ameetp> ara: good point
<ameetp> bladernr_: thanks.  we'll keep that in mind during testing
<ameetp> any other comments/questions for pedro_?
<ameetp> going once...
<ameetp> twice...
<ara> 500$!!
<ameetp> alright, [Topic] Maverick Work Items -- marjo

<marjo> nice looking burn-down chart; lots of green above the line and red below the line!
<ameetp> \o/
<marjo>  nice looking burn-down chart; lots of green above the line and red below the line!
* davmor2 has quit (Quit: I'm outta here)
<pedro_> great work everybody :-)
<marjo> it would look even better if the burndown line was set to 38 initially
<marjo> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/qa-maverick-automated-server-testing
<marjo> hggdh will focus on finishing the last two remaining test cases
<marjo> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/qa-maverick-bugsquad-roadmap
<marjo> pedro has postponed the update / make a new reporting bugs video to next release when we'll know what would make for better information
<marjo> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/qa-maverick-improving-communication
<marjo> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/qa-maverick-mago-daily
<marjo> ara is making good progress on both
<marjo> any questions? otherwise, looking good for release!
<marjo> ameetp: that's all from me
<ameetp> thanks marjo!
<skaet> marjo,
<marjo> hi skaet
<skaet> just a heads up lots of churn today on the X/mesa front.
<marjo> skaet: yes, as expected
<skaet> cool.
<ameetp> skaet:  Thanks for the FYI.  Anyone else have questions/comments for marjo?
<marjo> we went through a similar experience after the move to mesa 7.6
<ameetp> okay then
<ara> skaet, do we have a bug number?
<skaet> good to know.
<ara> skaet, I have been hearing all day about the "white screen of death" mixing intel & unity, but I haven't heard of a bug number
* ara asks at ubuntu-x
<skaet> ara,   lots of them.  will get them in background
<ara> skaet, OK
<marjo> skaet: fyi, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/Mesa7.6
<skaet> last I saw there was a workaround for the "white screen of death",  but its pretty active right now on the #ubuntu-x channel.
<ameetp> skaet:  sounds good.  I'll move up.  Just chime in with the bug number(s) 
<ameetp> anything else... going once.
<ameetp> twice
<skaet> ammetp,  ack.
<ameetp> [Topic] Misc. Items - anything people want to discuss
<Mootbot-UK> New Topic:  Misc. Items - anything people want to discuss
<fader> o/
<skaet> ara,  white screen bug is 638808
<ameetp> fader: go ahead
<fader> I want to mention something that cjohnston was asking about (and posted to the mailing list)
<fader> Specifically https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommunityContributePages
<cjohnston> o/
<fader> ara has offered to fill out some of the tester info but I'm sure she wouldn't object to help
<fader> :)
<ara> fader, I already posted it, but any review is more than welcome
<fader> And I think there may be some other areas on that wiki page that the QA community might want to provide input on
<ara> and everyone, feel free to edit
* brianchidester has quit (Quit: Ex-Chat)
<fader> ara: You're fast! :)
<cjohnston> thanks ara !
<fader> That's it from me.
<ara> fader, bits missing: the picture (working on it, thanks to bladernr_) and the "specific case"
* Hoaas (~hoaas@84-16-209.201.3p.ntebredband.no) has left #ubuntu-quality
<ara> but I have seen that the other sections haven't fill that either
<ara> cjohnston, is something that are you requesting? or finally is going to be out=
<ara> ?
<ara> reviews welcome: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommunityContributePages#Testers
<cjohnston> I have sent emails to all ML's that haven't yet filled theirs out.. Hoping to get the rest done, and then get everything put into place
<ara> cjohnston, thanks for organizing this
<ameetp> cjohnston, ara: thanks for starting this process
<cjohnston> :-) thanks for helping
<marjo> cjohnston: thanks for organizing this
<ameetp> any other topics?
<skaet> maverick x related bugs:  602899, 607490, 625239, 628077, 633593
<ara> skaet, thanks
<ameetp> fader: we should double check that we don't need to add "pcert" tag to those bugs
<ameetp> alright.  Looks like there are no other Misc. topics
<ameetp> going once...
<ameetp> twice...
<marjo> ameetp: good idea
<ameetp> alright, our favorite topic [Topic] select a new chair
<charlie-tca> I will... learning by doing.
<marjo> charlie-tca: thx!
<bladernr_> wow that was fast
<charlie-tca> You are welcome
<ameetp> charlie-tca thanks!!
<charlie-tca> You are welcome
<marjo> bladernr_ please note that as an example of volunteerism
* fader high fives charlie-tca.
<ameetp> that was fast.  Well, all of you have been a great audience
<bladernr_> marjo:  I'm old enough to know better about volunteering
<ameetp> I will end the meeting...
