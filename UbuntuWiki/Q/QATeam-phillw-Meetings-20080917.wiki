==== Agenda - 2008-09-17 ====

* Automated bug replies - A recent <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-bugsquad/2008-September/001111.html|thread]]</nowiki> regarding the kernel's automated call for testing has raised some concerns.  For future reference, I'd like to discuss if we should establish a set of guidelines these types of automated posts should follow?  For example, should it be clearly stated this is an automated response, what the odds of a response to the automated reply being seen by a real person, etc.   
* Getting <nowiki>[[QATeam-ReleaseReports|QATeam-ReleaseReports]]</nowiki> in shape for the next release meeting - heno.
* <nowiki>[[http://ubuntutesting.wordpress.com/2008/09/17/announcing-ubuntu-testing-day/|Testing day]]</nowiki> preparations
** Volunteers to be on hand
** Tidying up the test documentation - what should we prioritise before the even and what is suitable for editing during it?
* Triage of <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bugs?field.tag=regression-potential|potential regression]]</nowiki> bugs
