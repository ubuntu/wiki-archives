__TOC__


The testing focus for this week will be the new manual testcases written during the hackfest this past week. You can find them on the packages tracker here:

<nowiki>[[http://packages.qa.ubuntu.com/qatracker/milestones/263/builds|Application Tests]]</nowiki>

Also, the call for testing unity is continuing, with in-dash payments landing in the ppa and needing testing:

<nowiki>[[http://packages.qa.ubuntu.com/qatracker/milestones/262/builds|Unity Tests]]</nowiki>

In addition the daily images are leading up to the final beta and could use testing:

Click each link below to be taken to a page on the qatracker with the testcases, and the submission page to submit test results.
