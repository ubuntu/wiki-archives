== Introduction ==

'''Please note that Ubuntu 12.10 Beta 1 has been superseded by <nowiki>[[QuantalQuetzal-TechnicalOverview-Beta2|Ubuntu 12.10 Beta 2]]</nowiki>, which we advise you to use instead.'''

The Ubuntu developers are moving quickly to bring you the absolute latest and greatest software the Open Source community has to offer. The Quantal Quetzal Beta 1 Release of Ubuntu 12.10 give you a preview of the next version of Ubuntu.

== Get Ubuntu 12.10 ==
=== Upgrading from Ubuntu 12.04 LTS ===

To upgrade from Ubuntu 12.04 LTS on a desktop system, open Software Sources. Switch to the Updates tab and set ''Notify me of a new Ubuntu version'' to ''For any new version''. Press Alt+F2 and type in "update-manager -d" (without the quotes) into the command box. Update Manager should open up and tell you: New distribution release '12.10' is available. Click Upgrade and follow the on-screen instructions.  

To upgrade from Ubuntu 12.04 LTS on a server system: ensure that <code>/etc/update-manager/release-upgrades</code> includes ''Prompt=Normal''. Install the <code>update-manager-core</code> package if it is not already installed; launch the upgrade tool with the command <code>sudo do-release-upgrade -d</code>; and follow the on-screen instructions. Note that the server upgrade will utilize GNU screen and automatically re-attach in case of e.g. dropped connection problems.

Offline upgrade options via alternate CDs are no longer offered for Ubuntu Desktop and Ubuntu Server. Please ensure you have network connectivity to one of the official mirrors or to a locally accessible mirror and follow the instructions above.

=== Download the Beta 1 ===

Beta 1 images can be downloaded from a location near you. 
<<BR>>'''Note:''' The Ubuntu Desktop images are now bigger than a standard CD, and you should use a USB or DVD for installation.  Some image consolidation has occurred as well.

You can download Beta 1 ISOs from:

=== Updated Packages ===

As with every new release, packages--applications and software of all kinds--are being updated at a rapid pace. Many of these packages came from an automatic sync from <nowiki>[[http://www.debian.org|Debian]]</nowiki>'s unstable branch; others have been explicitly pulled in for 12.10 Quantal Quetzal.

For a list of all packages being accepted for 12.10 Quantal Quetzal, please subscribe to quantal-changes: https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/quantal-changes .

==== Linux kernel 3.5.3 ====

Quantal Beta-1 includes the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.5.0-13.14|3.5.0-13.14 Ubuntu linux kernel]]</nowiki> which was based on the <nowiki>[[http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v3.x/linux-3.5.3.tar.bz2|v3.5.3 upstream Linux kernel]]</nowiki>. This is an update from the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.5.0-6.6|3.5.0-6.6 Ubuntu kernel]]</nowiki> which shipped in the Quantal Alpha-3 release and was based on the <nowiki>[[http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v3.x/linux-3.5.tar.bz2|v3.5 upstream Linux kernel]]</nowiki>.  Key changes with the Quantal Beta 1 kernel includes cleanup of redundant firmware files, updated EDAC/CLK highbank patches, brcmsmac and apple-gmux driver updates, and misc bug fixes and config changes .  As with the Quantal Alpha releases, the Quantal beta 1 kernel continues to include the transitioning of the i386 generic-pae flavor to become the generic flavor offering, collapsing of the virtual flavor back into the generic flavor, and standardizing of the entire linux-meta package.

==== Python 3.0 ====

For 12.10, we intend to ship only <nowiki>[[http://docs.python.org/release/3.0.1/whatsnew/3.0.html|Python 3]]</nowiki> with the Ubuntu desktop image, not Python 2.  Beta-1 continues this process.

If you have your own programs based on Python 2, fear not!  Python 2 will continue to be available (as the `python` package) for the foreseeable future.  However, to best support future versions of Ubuntu you should consider porting your code to Python 3.  <nowiki>[[Python-3]]</nowiki> has some advice and resources on this.

=== General ===

Until Ubuntu 11.10, the Unix group for administrators with `root` privileges through sudo had been `admin`. Starting with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, it is now `sudo`, for compatibility with Debian and sudo itself. However, for backwards compatibility, `admin` group members are still recognized as administrators.

Automatic Apport crash reporting has been enabled by default again to catch problems early on. It now <nowiki>[[http://www.piware.de/2011/11/apport-1-90-client-side-duplicate-checking/|checks for duplicates on the client side]]</nowiki>, which will avoid uploading debug data and creating Launchpad bug reports unnecessarily in many cases now.

=== Ubuntu ===

There is no longer a traditional CD-sized image, DVD or alternate image, but rather a single 800MB Ubuntu image that can be used from USB or DVD.  Users who previously installed using LVM or full-disk encryption via the alternate CD will find that these installation targets are supported by the consolidated image in 12.10.

Update Manager has been streamlined and renamed Software Updater.  It also now checks for updates when launched.

A new X.org stack has been introduced which includes xserver 1.13 candidate versions, mesa 9.0, and updated X libs and drivers.  The new xserver provides improved multiseat support, better smooth scrolling, and a large variety of bug fixes.  The proprietary -nvidia driver now supports the RANDR standard for monitor configuration.  

Compiz with GLES support landed, making unity-3d work again on the pandaboard.

Unity was updated to version 6.4 including support for dash previews and coverflow view.

Other notable updates include:
* Jockey has been deprecated in favor of a "Drivers" component in software-properties.
* Libreoffice was updated to 3.6.1 with built-in menubar & HUD support without needing a separate plugin.
* GNOME has been updated to 3.5.90 for most of the components.

=== Ubuntu Server ===

Unlike the Desktop flavour, we are currently targeting the 12.10 Server image to fit onto a standard cd image (703MB). 

Notable updates:
* Juju <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/juju/2012-June/001696.html|Charm Store policy]]</nowiki> implementation, and <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/juju/2012-July/001751.html|Charm maintainer]]</nowiki> assignment.
* Ceph updated to 0.48.1 (upstream argonaut stable release):
** RADOS Gateway (S3 and Swift Compatible) now available.

* armhf cloud images available.
* cloud-init support for "config drive v2" from Openstack Folsom.
* Starting with Ubuntu 12.10, the Ubuntu Cloud Images no longer have the 'ubuntu' user pre-populated in the images. The 'ubuntu' user is now created on first boot by cloud-init unless instructed otherwise.  This allows easy creation of instances with no 'ubuntu' user and even no users.
* Ubuntu 12.10 provides Apache Tomcat 7 as the default, supported version of Tomcat. Existing installations of tomcat6 will continue to function; its recommended that users upgrade to the tomcat7 package as soon as possible.
* New version of MAAS is available. This realease has dropped the usage of maas-provision, and features its own, MAAS managed, DNS and DHCP server.

=== Kubuntu ===

Kubuntu now comes on 1GB images for a USB drive or DVD.

Other notable updates: 
* KDE Plasma and Applications 4.9 add many new features and fixes
* Calligra is the default office and graphics suite adding top class painting and database applications
* New login manager LightDM adds a guest session feature for letting your friends use your computer quickly

* Digikam 2.8 adds better photo handling http://www.digikam.org/drupal/node/661.
* The release of Rekonq 1 gives Kubuntu the stable web browser it deserves.
* A Facebook resources in Kontact means you can get calendar and contact information from your Facebook account.
* While a Google resource means you can get calendar information from your Google account .

== Known issues ==

As is to be expected, at this stage of the release process, there are some significant known bugs that users may run into with the Quantal Beta 1 Release.
