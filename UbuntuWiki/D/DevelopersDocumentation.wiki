__TOC__

Ubuntu developers' documentation includes all necessary information to help someone not acquainted to the system's inner workings to establish enough solid knowledge to start contributing to the system, both development and QA wise. As a such it would assume certain amount of familiarity with common development and hacking terms which would be required to know before diving in to the wonderful world of Ubuntu hacking. We are not going to rewrite every single piece of doc that is relevant to the system, just be sure to give at least starters links and pinpoints to get somebody going, and fill in the missing parts.
