__TOC__

I am an enthusiastic Linux user who moved from having theoretical knowledge to being an advaned user after being introduced to Ubuntu Linux in 2008 by <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/GanyaniKhosa|Ganyani Khosa]]</nowiki>
My first real work was more on the desktop side of things and participated in the migration of  <nowiki>[[http://www.parliament.gov.zw|Parliament of Zimbabwe]]</nowiki> to Ubuntu Linux
 
The rest has been history and im one person who does not belieive in a controlled or limited society and Ubuntu is the solution being freely available you can build what ever you want as long as you have the hardware and expertise alone 

Currently i am eager to implement Ubuntu Linux based servers and Ubuntu linux based software solutions
like firewalls ,packet filters ,mail and proxy servers etc
