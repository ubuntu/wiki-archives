=== About me ===

'''Si deseas leer <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DKcross/es|mi wiki en Español sigue este enlace]]</nowiki> '''

I’m a twenty-one-year-old Ubuntero from El Salvador in Central America. I have a great passion for  Free Software projects especially the Ubuntu project. My interest in GNU/Linux started in 2003 as I started using Mandrake 9.1. I had tried Knoppix 3.1 before, but then Ubuntu was presented to me. When I first knew about Ubuntu with Breezy Badger (5.10) I didn’t change immediately to it because I was willing to try different "distros" of GNU/Linux. !OpenSuse and its 10.2 version was the one that got me completely into the world of GNU/Linux.When Ubuntu Gutsy Gibbon 7.10 was released, I started reading more about Ubuntu and I became more interested in it. Then, when I discovered how popular and promising this distro was, I finally decided to switch to Ubuntu instead of !OpenSuse.

'''Working in launchpad for Ubuntu '''

I want help to Ubuntu, this is the first idea about my work in Ubuntu global community, and have any actions on launchpad, you can see the summary <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~dkcross/+karma|here]]</nowiki>.

Some of the contributions are :
* Translations 
* Answers  
* <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/~dkcross|Bugs]]</nowiki>

=== Plans & vision for Ubuntu ===
Keep working on the Ubuntu project, collaborating in the communities where I use to participate (Ubuntu-sv,-gt Ubuntu, Ubuntu-hn, Ubuntu-ni-ve Ubuntu, Ubuntu-uy,-centroamerica Ubuntu, Ubuntu-mx, Ubuntu-es), trying to see people becoming more friendly to the community and motivates them to follow and fully migrate to Ubuntu.

Ubuntu is an amazing project, that fills many visions I have for the future. Including getting people close and seeing as a powerful GNU alternative that fills all needs and without they need to be experts in computers and GNU / Linux of course. Also in education Ubuntu may be the perfect operating system for schools to work, where not only they will have a powerful desktop, but a proper system of education with packages such as Edubuntu and other great tools.

'''In the future, i would like to...'''

* Become a developer of package(s)
* Work with the MOTU team to help maintain packages
* Work on my English, and continue to help the translations team

==== In all teams ====
* Ubuntu El Salvador Team
''It is the community where I participate the most, organizing events to promote Ubuntu. Free software projects to exploit its advantages and ethical principles for the development of my country El Salvador. My vision of the future is clear, work hard to make people more and more comfortable with the community, so they can find support and they can also invite other people to enter the world of GNU/Linux through Ubuntu community. Keep working for the community to create more projects that benefit us all.
* Others Ubuntu Team 
I love help to others, I'm working with others 
LoCo teams (ubuntu-hn,ubuntu-gt,ubuntu-ni,ubuntu-ve,ubuntu-uy,ubuntu-cr,ubuntu-pa) because they are like brothers, and its a good oportunity to help the people that is new in Ubuntu world.

=== Cheers from the community ===

* DKcross has made since he begins in Ubuntu, all types of assistance. He has unfolded almost like a teacher in a community mainly composed without knowledge of Linux users in both the creation of video tutorials and explanations, and custom documentation. I would recommend him as a Member of the Ubuntu community, where I am sure it would provide (as it has done) on the establishment and growth of the Ubuntu project, '''<nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~andresj551|Andres Jalinton]]</nowiki>'''.

* DKcross is a great contributor to the Ubuntu community, not only active in the Ubuntu community El Salvador but has participated in Ubuntu communities in other countries such as Uruguay, ALWAYS willing to help. Dkcross has made tutorials, videos, guides to share his knowledge and help others learn more about Free Software. That is why I would recommend him as a Member of the Ubuntu community. '''<nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~sofvitale|Sofía Vitale]]</nowiki>'''

* I've been in contact with DKcross for more than half year, and he has proven to be a strong worker for the comunity in the salvador-team. He has also been working for quite a long time with the Ubuntu-Salvador website and other services. For this and far more, I give him my support on his career as Ubuntu member. '''SantiagoZarate'''

* DKcross is a very collaborative person with the community of El Salvador, without him I never would have interested me in the GNU / Linux world. He is an example to follow, he is very cooperative and he work very hard in the Ubuntu community as a leader in El Salvador. It is not enough to talk about the actions that he does in the community, he never thinks only about himself but in the entire community. As he says, we are a community not only a few. It not enough to say that DKcross ALWAYS want to help and share his knowledge and help everyone who asks his help to let other people know more about Free Software. Because of thata, I would recommend him as a Member of the Ubuntu community.'''<nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~jalecrox|Jalecrox]]</nowiki>''''

* Personally DKcross, has been the most active and has show more interest in Free Software projects, in addition to being a person very helpful in every way. Dk deserves and I recommend him as a member of the Ubuntu community. I think I don't have to mention about how many projects he had been involved and how much effort he had put in them. I have no more than recommend DK to be an Ubuntu community member '''<nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ahcupidin-ubuntusv|Ahcupidin]]</nowiki>'''

* Dkcross have taught me so much of this environment, thanks to you I saw the opportunity to install and use Ubuntu on my pc! I think for each person who knows you, you are a role model to follow. Thanks for your teaching '''<nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~eucita|Eucita]]</nowiki>'''

* DKcross has been a person very supportive to the Ubuntu Honduras community, now reborning. He is always supporting us in IRC #ubuntu-hn and had been helpful to all in a friendly, patient and unselfish way. I appreciate your support and all the helped I have had receive from you in learning about Ubuntu. '''<nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~tatica1|Tatica1]]</nowiki>'''
* DKcross is for me the top Ubuntu contributor : he has put a lot of himself into working for many projects, he's very open minded, and moreover, he's very talkative. I think as Eucita that he should be a Ubuntu member model. Keep going! '''<nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~yaitanes|Yaitanes]]</nowiki>'''

* DKcross has been a huge help with a community project I am working on in El Salvador (see http://proyectojuanchacon.blogspot.com/2009/08/it-feels-good-to-be-part-of-history.html).  In addition to volunteering his own time and support, he has actively mobilized the Ubuntu community in San Salvador, introducing several other people to the project.  We need more Ubuntu members like DKcross! '''<nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~jelkner|Jeffrey Elkner]]</nowiki>'''

* DKcross is a motivated and helpful member of the community. I have spoken to him in #ubuntu+1, and he is always willing to test out the latest bleeding edge packages and relentlessly triage any bugs. I am confident that Ubuntu will be a higher quality distribution with him around." '''<nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~mpontillo|Mike Pontillo]]</nowiki>'''

* DKcross is a great person. He has really interest in helping other Loco specially in Ubuntu Honduras. He gives many contribution via IRC in which he has help many users. Go DKcross. '''<nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DiegoTurcios | Diego Turcios]]</nowiki> '''
