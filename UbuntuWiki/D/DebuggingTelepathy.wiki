== Introduction ==

This page gives an overview over how to efficiently debug Telepathy problems.

== Debugging procedure ==

=== Connection managers ===
If problems occur in connection managers, the debug output can help sometimes:
* For `telepathy-salut`: <pre>
SALUT_DEBUG=all telepathy-salut
</pre>
* For `telepathy-gabble`: <pre>
GABBLE_DEBUG=all telepathy-gabble
</pre>

Just make sure you stop all instances of those connection-managers beforehand. You can also test connection-managers using the `telepathy-inspector` package.

=== Persistent Connection Managers ===

To make `telepathy-idle` not exit, when there's not client connected, use this: <pre>
IDLE_PERSIST=1 telepathy-idle
</pre>

=== Applications ===
If problems occur in clients, you can get debug output for them too:
* For `gossip`: <pre>
GOSSIP_DEBUG=all gossip
</pre>
* For `cohoba`: <pre>
/usr/lib/cohoba/cohoba-applet -w
/usr/lib/cohoba/cohoba-applet houston
</pre>
