'''dog·ged''', ~-adjective: ''Stubbornly persevering; tenacious''-~

Dapper was already good before it was a release candidate. I wanted to contribute. My installation was Edgy, but now I've got Feisty.

__Objectives__
* Contribute to Kubuntu, with a focus on security, documentation, examples, process automation and Python;
** Security:
** Original source availability is great; but automated, on-demand source re-extraction may improve responsiveness to security concerns, such as to show a client whether and how their system has or has not been compromised. This of course might help little if the problem is a corrupt BIOS whose state cannot be reversed... (comments welcome, BTW.)
* Work with scripting that enables further automation of the work involved in making custom '''Live/Install ISOs''':
** Adept > Interface (I/O) > burned DVD;
* Use SVG to visualise various aspects of project work;
* Apply concepts documented by Edward Tufte;
* Earn money, get clients, introduce them to Kubuntu (probably not in that order);
* Develop and promote arguments for an ''Adept ISO image creator'' enhancement;

__Method__

* ''how about via subversion?'' http://websvn.kde.org/trunk/playground/edu/kdissert/
* http://developer.kde.org/documentation/tutorials/subversion/
* Follow https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LiveCDCustomizationHowTo

__Commands__

* Downloaded dapper-live-i386.iso using KTorrent to /media/hda2/local/custom-dapper-6.04-dvd/
* sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/swap bs=1M count=5000
** This seems to have done the business on hda1:

* # Note: for this set-up, a better command might have been: <code>sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/media/hda2/tmp/swap bs=1M count=5000</code>
* sudo mkswap /tmp/swap
* sudo swapon /tmp/swap
* sudo apt-get install cloop-utils mkisofs
* echo "Kernel version is" $(dpkg-query -W --showformat '${Version}' linux-image-$(uname -r))

* export LC_ALL=C
* cd /media/hda2/local/custom-dapper-6.04-dvd/
* mkdir mnt
* sudo mount dapper-live-i386.iso mnt -o loop
