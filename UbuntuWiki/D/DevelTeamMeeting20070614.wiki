==== Adilson Oliveira (adilson) ====

Done:
* Fixed problem with hildon-theme-tools
* hildon-theme-layout-4 and hildon-themes-plankton pushed
* Work at google with Intel and Nokia on the procedures to have a hildon enviromment working on Gutsy.

==== Alexander Sack (asac) ====

This week i spent most of my time to work on the free-flash spec implementation; in addition, i mentored my MOTU student and sponsored a few packages. On the mozilla end, I set up a bzr branch to package firefox-granparadiso and started to implement the extension part of the firefox-distro-addon-support spec.

Some Details:

Free Flash
* implement initial version of easy-codec install patch
   http://people.ubuntu.com/~asac/gnash_missing_codec_v0001-filtered.patch
* fix build system for gnash: now klash, konqueror plugin can all be build in one build run, without adding depends on qt/kde to gnash and mozilla-plugin packages.
* testing AGG and opengl renderer; though AGG appears to have benefits over opengl, it currently doesn't work with klash/konqueror plugin, so we stick with opengl for the first upload; AGG patch for klash/konqueror is available on trunk, but needs backport/verification. (-> TODO)
* discussed the benefits (for distributors of binary packages) of a pluggable renderer architecture with upstream
* discussed and coordinated package update for gnash 0.8.0 release with debian maintainer; joined alioth team; packaged plain gnash 0.8.0 and uploaded to debian.
* branched ubuntu gutsy package, included easy-codec patch and tweaked depends/recommends/suggests.
* take care that gnash CVS HEAD was properly synched to launchpad.

Mozilla
* setup grandparadiso (firefox 3 preview) bzr branch
* started to implement ubuntu-distro extension for firefox
* firefox bug discussion and triage

Next requirement is to build a liveCD with Unionfs2.0 to test for any unexpected regressions.
