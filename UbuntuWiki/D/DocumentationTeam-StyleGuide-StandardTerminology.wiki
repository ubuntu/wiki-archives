This section provides a list of terms that are commonly found in technical documentation. You should use the spellings of words as documented in this section whenever you use those words in Ubuntu documentation.

This list is not exhaustive. For terminology that is not listed here, refer to the <nowiki>[[http://library.gnome.org/devel/gdp-style-guide/2.20/gnome-glossary-desktop.html.en|Gnome Desktop Style Guide Term List]]</nowiki>.

=== General ===

==== How to Refer to Ubuntu ====

# Use "Ubuntu operating system" the first time you refer to Ubuntu, then use "Ubuntu" thereafter. You can use the terms "Ubuntu system" and "Ubuntu environment" when they are more appropriate than "Ubuntu operating system."
# You can use "Ubuntu Linux distribution" or "Ubuntu Linux distro," but try to reserve those terms for audiences who do not need to have "distribution" or "distro" explained to them.
# You can use "Kubuntu", "Kubuntu system", "Kubuntu environment", and "Kubuntu distribution" when referring to Ubuntu with the KDE desktop environment. Note that it is still the Ubuntu operating system, not the Kubuntu operating system.
# Use "based on Debian GNU/Linux" when referring to Ubuntu's Debian roots.
# Use "Linux-based" when referring to Ubuntu's kernel roots.
# You might find that you must use the term "Ubuntu Linux". If so, consider using the phrase "based on Debian GNU/Linux".
# If you use any of the following terms, you must explain them in the text following their first use, as well as in the glossary (if there is a glossary). 
## Debian
## GNU/Linux 
## Linux 
## distribution 
## distro  
 The only exception is when the audience of the document is already familiar about the terms.
1. If there is an About Ubuntu section in your document, describe Ubuntu and its genealogy, including GNU/Linux, Debian, and the Linux kernel.

=== GUI Terms ===

==== check box ====

* '''Description:''' An on/off element used for selecting and deselecting an option. Usually signified by a check mark, but sometimes by an "X".

* '''Usage:''' The phrase "check box" is seldom used in text. It is more common to use words such as "select", "deselect", and "choose", depending on the user action being described. If there is any ending punctuation such as a period, colon, or ellipsis on the label associated with the check box, do not use the punctuation in your text.

* '''Doc''''''Book Tags:''' Since a check box usually has a label associated with it, use the <code><guilabel></guilabel></code> tags for the check box name.

* '''Example:''' Select the <guilabel>Case sensitive</guilabel> option.

==== drop-down combination box ====

'''NOTE:''' The drop-down combination box is currently being discussed on the ubuntu-doc mailing list. The information below will likely be changed.

* '''Description:''' The combo box is the combination of a text box and a drop-down list. The list is activated by clicking the arrow to the right of the text box. You can either type into the text box or select an item from the list.

* '''Usage:''' Use "choose" to tell the user what to select rather than specifying whether to use the drop-down list or the text box. A possible exception is in documents where users might be unfamiliar with combo boxes, such as a document for those who have never used a computer before. Avoid the term "combo box". Use "drop-down combination box" instead.

* '''Doc''''''Book Tags:''' Since a combo box usually has a label associated with it, use the <code><guilabel></guilabel></code> tags for the combo box name.

* '''Example:''' Choose <userinput>Ubuntu</userinput> from the <guilabel>Operating System</guilabel> drop-down combination box.

==== command button ====

* '''Description:''' The classic button. You press it to start an action.
