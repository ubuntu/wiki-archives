Done
* Archive rebuild kicked off, in progress, and FTBFS-fixing uploads have been happening as quickly as I can fix and/or delegate
* Spent a great deal of the week in sessions with the Soyuz folks over various bugs and misfeatures, as well as some minor fallout from the apt-ftparchive upgrade
* Plenty of archive maintenance tasks, clearing out queue/new on a far more regular basis (we sure do like to upload just before a freeze, don't we?)
To do
* Lots more FTBFS bugs to fix and delegate, I'm afraid.  They keep rolling in.
* Archive administration for the freeze/release.
* Make sure we're ready for edgy-security and edgy-updates.
* Make sure my Soyuz bits are ready to open edgy+1.
Milestone bugs
* #61684: livefs task/metapackage mangling, should be fixed already, but confirming the fix is working as expected before I close it
* #63336: bizarre samba rc?.d symlinks appearing from nowhere, this was fixed once in hoary(?), but seems to have come back, however the package that used to cause the bug no longer seems to contain the buggy code.. I'm at a loss
* #63693: conffile upgrade prompt with initramfs-tools, looks like it may have been a bug in dapper's d-i.  Once I install a dapper system and confirm the bug, the fix is trivial and non-intrusive (copy and paste of some code from dapper, even)

Done:
* security updates: PHP, Mozilla, 
* Edgy security review, applied a few missing patches that fell through the cracks; in a good state now
* caught up with pending MIRs
* bug triage/fix sprint; brought my own milestone bug list down to zero, starting to look into unassigned milestone bugs and general FTBFS issues from autotests builds now
* transition uploads to get rid of gnutls11 in universe, leaving us with only two gnutls versions for edgy (12 in universe, 13 in main); needs to be removed from the archive now (infinity might have already done that)
* new langpacks for edgy and dapper-proposed
Todo:
* CD testing
* helping with release-critical bug and FTBFS fixing wherever I can 
** bug #62593 is my pet bug on the list ATM; I'm sure I can fix it soon
** ogra noticed that edgy's gstreamer breaks the LTSP audiosink magic; if that's considered release critical, I'll fix that by tomorrow evening, too
** currently dealing with various FTBFSes (partly fixed already), poppler ABI change, etc.; my current list should get done today; I'm certain that infinity has more stuff to look into :)
* think about and draft SRU policy for langpacks
* question to mdz/tfheen/Kamion: when shall I upload the final edgy langpacks? Another round would be nice for last polish and to pick up the KDE 3.5.5 translations (they came too late for the current packs)
