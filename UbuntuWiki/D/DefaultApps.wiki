== Default Ubuntu Desktop Apps ==

Ubuntu Desktop includes a number of apps that are shipped by default (i.e. included on the CD image). These apps are included with the following criteria:
* They are good quality apps.
* They are useful to the target audience of Ubuntu Desktop users.
* They keep the CD image to a reasonable size.

Since Ubuntu 17.10 we ship the GNOME desktop by default. GNOME has a set of core apps that should be shipped by default. Where we are not shipping a core app we have listed here the reasons for this. A core app that doesn't have a reason not to ship is a good candidate for being a default app in Ubuntu. The list of core apps is managed in <nowiki>[[https://git.gnome.org/browse/jhbuild/tree/modulesets/gnome-suites-core-3.26.modules|jhbuild]]</nowiki>.

Any discussions about default apps should occur on the <nowiki>[[mailto:ubuntu-desktop@lists.ubuntu.com|Ubuntu Desktop mailing list]]</nowiki>.
