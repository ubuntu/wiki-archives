__TOC__

I have used Linux on and off since 1998. I started with Mandrake, moved to Redhat, and eventually on to Debian and then Ubuntu. I use Ubuntu on my desktop machine as well as a few various servers I administer.

As a budding sysadmin, I always thought that Debian was the end-all distribution for a server, and after spending enough hours with it on the desktop, there as well. But all of that changed after I installed 6.06. It was a better experience out of the box (off the CD?). I started to use it as a server, and found that even without any graphical niceties to look at, it still addressed all my qualms about Debian packaging and release cycles.

Ubuntu is the best distribution, bar none, for the desktop and laptop. I think Ubuntu has a long way to go before it can make major strides in the enterprise, but it success there lies at the feet of its community.
