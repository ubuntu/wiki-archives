=== Other Stuff ===
I am only 14 years old, so I don't know how much of a help I will be to Ubuntu users, although I will help to promote Ubuntu in any way I can.

I play lots of games on the PC and am in the process of resurrecting Windows for that reason only.(Windows wont boot and I don't care)

Yeah thats about it..
