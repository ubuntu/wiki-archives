=== Agenda ===

* Outstanding actions from last meeting
* [http://people.ubuntu.com/~dholbach/sponsoring/ Sponsoring Overview
* update]:

 desktop team is doing well, all but one patch is uploaded; Scott
 still has a few open bugs, though, but he isn't available today for
 further details

* Review activity reports

* Mirko's work is a bit stuck on his gdm work on face browser, since
 the new gdm is far from ready for Intrepid so far; he will continue
 to work with upstream and have a talk with Mark for our requirements
 in Intrepid.

* Martin asked about how everyone is doing with their spec
 implementations; no problems or drags were reported, aside from
 Mirko's above.

=== Outstanding actions from last meeting ===

* Matthew to follow up with upstream about UI improvements in new
 user admin tool: no response so far, he will mail again

=== Actions from this meeting ===

* Mirko to clarify gdm goals for face browser for Intrepid/Intrepid+1.

=== Activity reports ===

==== Jonathan Riddell (Riddell) ====

done:
* KDE 4.1 packaged and uploaded
* update-manager ported to Qt 4
* gdebi ported to Qt 4
* Fix avahi to compile in main
* Kubuntu meeting (one new member)

todo:
* system-config-printer-kde
* finish KDE 4 Rosetta support not cdbs compiles

no milestoned bugs

==== Kenneth Wimer (kwwii) ====

No report received.

==== Martin Pitt (pitti) ====

Assigned Intrepid specs:
* intrepid-device-permissions: No change since last week.
* jockey-printer-driver-support: No change since last week.
* gdm-guest-account: 
** After working on the guest setup scripts for about a week, I
  discovered many bugs in graphics drivers and kernel oopses, so
  that I doubt that I'll ever get this stable enough with the "do
  everything from scratch" approach. Sad to say that this was wasted
  work :-(
** So I went ahead and hacked guest support into our current gdm,
  with externalizing as much as possible into the new
  gdm-guest-session package. Both are in intrepid now, feedback
  appreciated. AppArmor profile landed today. UI integration still
  missing.

Currently open milestoned bugs:
* Intrepid: #224697 (Disable hibernation if swap is on file), #232428
 (guile 1.6 -> 1.8 transition), #246550 (upgrade conffile prompt):
 will do later, specs go first

Other non-chores work done:
* got the apport retracers back into working order, including intrepid

==== Matthew Paul Thomas (mpt) ====

No report received, busy with Launchpad.

==== Michael Vogt (mvo) ====

===== update-manager/release-upgrades =====
* reproduce/fix install-doc failure (#243830 and some duplicates)
* merge "better-nvidia-support" branch into update-manager that
 should now be able to automatically select the right nvidia driver on
 upgrade (and fix some issues like missing depends)
* improvements in the progress reporting for the non-interactive mode
 (needed for the sandbox-upgrade-tester) - not perfect yet, but a
 improvement
* merge the kde4 branch and do testing/fixing on it (some smallish
 issues with the terminal widget and other small bits), improve the
 test-code for the terminal widget along the way
* fix crashes

===== sandbox-upgrader =====
* add automatic test script that works on top of the cloned system
* create sandbox-upgrader package and put it into my PPA
* testing (work ok on my system now)
* feedback very welcome (needs a kvm capable machine and
 diskspace/bandwidth for the test), available in my PPA as
 sandbox-upgrader and then "sudo sandbox-test-upgrade"

===== systemwide-preferences =====
* sent mail to gnomecc list (stuck in the moderation queue?)
* add reader/writer for /etc/environment to the dbus backend

===== compiz =====
* analyze compiz hang for certain screensaver hacks (LP: #101943,
 compiz bug 961) that is caused by compiz not catching up fast
 enough with the xdamage events and and sent patch upstream
 (based on patch by Michel D�nzer)
* updated plugins-main to latest git
* looked into updating compiz core too, but little changes and the
 current kde3/kde4 code is difficult to split appart, needs more
 work (i.e. even with just kde4 enabled in configure it wants to
 build kde3 bits)

===== mobile =====
* make virtual-mobile-builder behave a bit more like
 moblin-image-creator and produce mccaslin-lpia-ume kvm images for
 the mobile team (this was complicated by the fact that with
 hardy-updates and hardy-security in sources.list midbrowser would not
 start because of some incompatibilty in the GRE version)

===== apt =====
* review/merge apt https branch by Arnaud Ebalard
* translated package descriptions update for intrepid
* fix incorrect reporting ofr "breaks" in at-cache unmet

===== SRU =====
* debug/fix problem with security.ubuntu.com display in
 software-properties (#244093)
* make anacron wakeup on resume in pm-utils too (#249220) and upload
 hardy version into my PPA, will do a SRU for it
* fix update-notifier shows incorrect number of updates problem (LP  #251494) 
* merge compiz animation fix for hardy (#LP 198370, opencompositing: #949) 
* debug/fix crash in python-apt when a package has no priority set,
 upload fixes to gutsy and hardy (#253255)
* add workaround for the crash in python-apt to the release-upgrader
 and upload fixes to intrepid and hardy-proposed

===== misc =====
* bug triage/mail
* some sponsoring (sponsoring list)
* review/merge potmodify.py script into apt-ddtp-tools to improve the
 translated package descriptions pot
* fixed HW issues in my desktop (replaced main power supply unit,
 fortunately that was all needed)
* fix gnome-session regression when update-notifier sents it the
 save-clients message before rebooting and sent patch upstream
 (#545123) 
* upload new libgksu to fix hang problem (#55172) - SRU too?
* new friendly-recover with some fixes

==== Mirco Müller (MacSlow) ====

login-experience/gdm-face-browser:
* using relative sizes in .json file for works now, will be able to make
 theme and layout adapt to screens aspect-ratio
 
* reading lots and lots of code of upstream simple-greeter, to get a
 better understanding which parts are needed for the graphical-greeter
 
* getting used to bzr's svn-plugin for importing upstream gdm-repository
 from GNOME's svn, but considering bzr-mirror.gnome.org because it's
 faster
 
* did small screencast of some early code...

==== Sebastien Bacher (seb128) ====

* lot of bugs triage
* looked a the sponsoring queue and subscribed people
* backported some fixes to hardy
* intrepid GNOME updates
* got a new mentoree, gave him some tasks and replied to his questions, sponsored his first desktop updates
* archive admin tasks
