== Introduction ==

The <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community|Community Help Wiki]]</nowiki> is a sub-project of the DocumentationTeam. It is a community-driven and open area of the Ubuntu documentation website which anyone can edit.

== How Can I Help? ==

The ways to help the Ubuntu Documentation team are almost limitless, but here's a short list of things you can start with: 

* '''Reading the <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WikiGuide|Wiki Guide]]</nowiki>''' will allow you to understand how to format the pages correctly.

* '''Proofreading''' is an important and easy way to help. You only need to follow the instructions, click the links and check spelling and grammar!

* '''<nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Tag|Tagging]]</nowiki>''' allows others to see what wiki pages need to be fixed based on the tag's description.

* In the past, some of the members imported guides from the !UbuntuForums.
