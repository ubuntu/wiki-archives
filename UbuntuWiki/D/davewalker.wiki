== Linux Usage History: ==
Began experimenting with Slackware during 1999 (v4).

Experimented with Ubuntu, December 2004 (Warty).

Solely used Ubuntu April 2005 - Present.

I first tried Linux with 'Slackware' back in 1999, but with very little support it was not possible to fully convert.  It took me a while to realise that Linux was more than just a console.  I was relieved when a friend showed me 'startx'.  At that point I realised that Linux could be a viable desktop OS, and I knew that eventually I wanted to fully convert.  I didn't feel comfortable fully switching to Linux until April 2005 - and in honestly, haven't missed the proprietary system I once used.
