Hi everyone

I'm Dieter, also known as "Didius" on irc/forums...

Currently I study education (called bachelor in education), in Ghent (HoGent, dept LERA), Belgium.

I am an ubuntu user since Warty and completly switched during those two years. I'm a convinced Open-source user and I try to convince many others to do the same thing. I began participating with Ubuntu-be after FOSDEM 2007.

These are the things I've helped Ubuntu-be with:
** I helped out at the VLOD-fair. <nowiki>[[BelgianTeam-VLOD_2007]]</nowiki>
** I helped organising the Ghent Dipro-fairs
*** <nowiki>[[BelgianTeam-ComputerFairs-Gent_06-05-2007]]</nowiki>
*** <nowiki>[[BelgianTeam-ComputerFairs-Gent_2007-09-16]]</nowiki>
*** <nowiki>[[BelgianTeam-ComputerFairs-Gent_2007-11-25]]</nowiki>
** Several Ubuntu installations (as a support point)

I've helped the Open-Source community with the following:
** Distribution en demo's of Ubuntu (edubuntu) at my school (about educational software)
** Participation in an Open-Source group at HoGent (workshops etc)
** Translation of Klavaro (educational typing software)

To contact me, please use this mail-adres dieter.vanderfaeillie AT gmail.com. (it's also my Jabber-account)

regards
Dieter
