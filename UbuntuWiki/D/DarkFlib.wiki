Email:  {en}

Within the UK Ubuntu community I am a fairly new face, having only been around for a few months.
Within the wider community I have been around for many years. I actively use and support Linux and other Open Source projects, providing online support on the Undernet and FreeNode IRC networks.

I am a capable coder, and have experience in networking, storage, voip and security.

I can be found on many channels on Undernet ( #phphelp, #programmer, #mysql, #sed and #linuxcode among others) and also on Freenode ( #asterisk-doc, #ubuntu, #ubuntu-uk ).
