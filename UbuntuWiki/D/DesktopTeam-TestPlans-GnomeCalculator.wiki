== Test Cases for Gnome Calculator ==

=== Activities integration ===
==== This test will check that mathematical operations can be previewed in the Gnome Activities overview ====

* Open Activities with the "Meta" key, or by clicking the button in the top-left corner of the desktop
* Type a mathematical expression, such as <code>7+2</code>
** A result entry is shown with <code>7+2  = 9</code>

=== Opening and Closing ===
==== This test will check that Gnome Calculator can be opened either from a terminal window or from the applications menu, and shutdown ====

* Open a terminal window, type <code>gnome-calculator</code> at the prompt and hit the "Enter" key
** Calculator opens
* Click the top right "X" of the window's title bar to close the application
** Calculator closes
* Open Gnome Calculator from your FAMILY menu
** Calculator opens

=== Menu options ===
==== This test will check that Gnome Calculator's Application menu options work as expected ====

* Navigate to Mode -> Basic
** Calculator's GUI changes to provide buttons suitable for basic equations
** Equations are entered in standard mathematical form. For example to add 7 and 2 enter the following: 7+2
* Navigate to Mode -> Advanced
** Calculator's GUI changes to provide buttons suitable for advanced mathematics such as Trigonometry
** Trigonometry calculations can be performed using the sin, cos, and tan functions. For example sin 45
* Navigate to Mode -> Financial
** Calculator's GUI changes to provide buttons suitable for financial equations
** Financial functions cannot be performed using the keyboard and the following buttons are available: Ctrm, Ddb, Fv, Gpm, Pmt, Pv, Rate, Sln, Syd and Term
* Navigate to Mode -> Programming
** Calculator's GUI changes to provide buttons suitable for computer programmers
** When in programming mode there is a drop down menu for binary (Ctrl+B keys), octal (Ctrl+O keys) and hexadecimal (Ctrl+H keys) and the 'á' button opens a dialogue to convert characters to character codes
* From the Hamburger menu select one of the given options for 'Number format'
** The format used to display results change accordingly to the selection made
* From the Hamburger menu navigate to Preferences
** Preferences dialogue window opens
* Decrease/increase the value of decimal places to show
** The number of decimal places, if trailing zeroes and if thousands separators are shown, change accordingly
* Tick the 'Trailing zeroes' option
** The format used to display results shows trailing zeroes
* Tick the 'Thousands separators' option
** The format used to display results shows digit grouping
* Click the 'Angle units' drop-down list and select one of the given options
** The unit used to display results, when performing trigonometry calculations, change accordingly to the selection made
* Click the 'Word size' drop-down list and select one of the given options
** The results when performing boolean algebra calculations, using the AND, OR and XOR operators, change accordingly to the selection made
* From the Hamburger menu navigate to About Calculator
** A dialogue window opens and the "Credits" and "Legal" buttons correctly display the associated information
* From the Hamburger menu navigate to Contents
** Calculator Help dialogue window opens

== What Could Go Wrong ==
Gnome Calculator provides a shell plugin to preview mathematical expressions in the Activities overview search bar.

If there is a bug in the plugin, the shell might become unresponsive or consume a high amount of CPU resources.
