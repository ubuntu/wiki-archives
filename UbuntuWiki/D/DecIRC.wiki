Since now, I'm an Ubuntero (I forgot to sign the code of conduct before...)

Email: 
* I live in Charleroi, Belgium.
* I'm working on a non-profit project called <nowiki>[[http://www.3x20.info/|3x20.info]]</nowiki> and Ubuntu was choosen as base of work.
* I'm actually creating a non-profit organisation (also called asbl in Belgium) to help the spread of OpenSource products at most places in Belgium, specially in Hainaut.
* As I have a dedicated webserver with a lot of Bandwidth, I'm hosting project I found interesting (Xubuntu installation without the net cd, usbuntu.info iso image, ...)
* I'm an Ubuntu evangelist. I'm using Linux since 1998 but before Ubuntu, I didn't try to convince people to leave the "other" OS and to switch to Linux. When Ubuntu arrives in my life, my opinion has changed. Before Linux was an OS for Geeks, and now, Ubuntu is an os for human. And as there are more humans than geeks, I have a lot of work. If there wasn't economical reasons (one wife, three children) I'll left my actual job to promote Ubuntu at full time.
* I'm also trying to promote Edubuntu is schools in local area where I'm living now.
* I'm activist (not in pejorative way) in <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BelgianTeam|Ubuntu-Be]]</nowiki> LocoTeam
* I've choose to spend a lot of time to promote officialy Ubuntu

*** I'm defending the Ubuntu colors in <nowiki>[[http://www.dipro.be/1/index.htm|Dipro Mega Computer Beurs]]</nowiki> around french speaking area of Belgium
*** I'm learning to <nowiki>[[http://www.3x20.info/|aged people]]</nowiki> to use a computer with Ubuntu
*** I'm helping workless people to discover computers <nowiki>[[http://www.seconde-chance.info|with not a lot of money]]</nowiki>
