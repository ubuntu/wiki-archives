__TOC__

Digitalkarabao is a slave from the Philippines. He would like to see a Linux distribution topple Gates' Windows, which happen to rule the streets of Quiapo, the pirate haven in his country, as the number one pirated Operating System. Dark as this may seem but this, he think, is a positive thing. Gates owes the world. And through pirates, Windows becomes pseudofree.
