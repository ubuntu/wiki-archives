== THIS PROJECT IS NOT MAINTAINED ANYMORE ==

Please remove this page.

== Introduction ==
Roverex, a derivative Ubuntu distribution, has been created to integrate IBM Lotus Software with Ubuntu, specifically Lotus Notes Client, Lotus Symphony and Domino Server.

IBM Lotus Notes Client and Domino Server 8 provide a secure email, scheduling, calendaring, messaging/chat platform and application development. 

IBM Lotus Symphony is an Office open source alternative that are intuitive and easy to use, which ensure access to documents well into the future with new standard file formats (ODF), and save existing investments with support for Microsoft® Windows® and Office file types.

Running IBM Lotus Software on Ubuntu lowers maintenance costs and with open standards enables easy integration and maintenance in a heterogeneous IT environment.
