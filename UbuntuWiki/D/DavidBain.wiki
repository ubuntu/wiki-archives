Linux, Python, Zope, Web

I'm a web developer, big into open source, with a decided focus on Zope. Ubuntu has been my distribution of choice since about September 2004 (had to get Gnome 2.8). I hope to contribute useful information specific to running Zope under Ubuntu.

I administer a few Zope sites now including <nowiki>[[http://www.jalug.org|the Jamaica Linux User Group]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[http://www.alteroo.com|own companies website]]</nowiki>.
