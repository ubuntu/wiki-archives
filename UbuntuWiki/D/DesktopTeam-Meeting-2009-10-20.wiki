==== Tony Espy (awe) ====
* Monday - holiday
* general network-manager triage
* ran tests on my macbook with BCM4312 Wi-Fi card.  Reported driver-specific (Broadcom 'wl') bug (LP: 452571)
* ran several Jaunty to Karmic upgrades trying to reproduce (LP: 435073) to no avail.  Milestone was dropped as nobody could reliably reproduce.
* did several UNR install while trying to reproduce jockey bug (LP: 440294): Cannot enable Broadcom STA Wireless driver

==== Till Kamppeter (tkamppeter) ====
* Freeze exception (approved): Let system-config-printer preferably use HPIJS and not the new hpcups when setting up HP printers, hpcups has a lot of regressions (LP: #452532).
* Freeze exception (approved): If CUPS queues broadcasted from other servers via DNS-SD have UTF-8 characters in their description, and the dnssd backend of the new CUPS 1.4.x discovers these queues, it is not possible any more to set up queues (even local queues) with system-config-printer as the new-printer wizard crashes immediately. Such broadcasts come mainly from Mac OS X. This makes system-config-printer unusable for all users who have at least one Mac in their network (LP: #437997).
* Fixed also LP: #448583 and LP: #444280 in system-config-printer before final freeze.
* CUPS (before Final Freeze): Made cold-plugging of USB printers correctly work also if the usblp kernel module is loaded; Made new usb CUPS backend also work with USB URIs of older CUPS versions (LP: #450513).
* Answered and triaged printing-related bug reports.
