=== Adam Conrad (infinity) ===

Done:
* build-failure-process: After many talks with cprov and some tests, this is rolled out in production, but not turned on, awaiting one final fix, which should be done today.
* Spent lots of time this week with Team Soyuz, discussing their specs, discussing new and shiny bugs, and generally giving them gentle shoves in the directions we need.
* General archive maintenance, NEW processing, etc.
* Re-rolled, tested, published, and re-released the 6.06.1 Ubuntu Server CD for sparc.
* General buildd maintenance, as usual.
* Some random bugfixing, bootstrapping, and other faff not worth expanding.
To do:
* While everyone is off sprinting, I intend to finish up what's left of larger-livefs, live-cd-stacked-filesystems, livefs-build-speedups, and debian-maintainer-field.  None have a great deal of work left, but all have some odd requirements here and there.
* Need to put the pieces together with pitti to get ddebs off the buildds and onto rookery.
* Need to do a couple dozen uploads for FTBFS issues to get edgy's out-of-date count back down to zero.
