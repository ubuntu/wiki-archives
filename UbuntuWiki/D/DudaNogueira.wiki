== My Wiki Pages ==
* http://wiki.ubuntubrasil.org/UbuntuParaCriancas - '''For those who want to learn with play'''
- A list of all the Kids applications (and also conferring the translations and pt-br material), showing how to create a user with no access to /home/users, *studying* how to create a easy local http-proxy-filter content for adults that want to allow the use of kids without the fear of loosing data.

* http://wiki.ubuntubrasil.org/VoipNoUbuntu - '''For those who want to talk freely'''
- As the VOIP Operators in Brazil listed in this wiki doesn't show in their site that they support linux, e decided to create this document showing all the voip applications for Ubuntu and also how to configure the Voip Operators in each program.

* http://wiki.ubuntubrasil.org/UbuntuParaJornalistas - '''For those who is a press professional''' - I had made a talk with this content on FLISOL/II Ubuntu Meeting (28/04)
- CONSTRUCTING - This document will show how a regular journalist and "press assistor" could use the applications avalible in Ubuntu Linux for work on creating releases, organizing contacts and events, generating labels for mass send of releases, liferea for news reading and other stuff.

* http://www.ubuntugames.org - '''For those who wanna have fun!'''
- GOING INTERNATIONAL - Had contacted the right person (Coringao) and will work with him to define a new communication process, to create a mailing list, to redefine all the the wiki structure, translate everything and call the community help for translating it to other languages. My preview is to finish this until 30 May. Im planning to afilliate the planet.ubuntu.com for making international announcements about this project.
