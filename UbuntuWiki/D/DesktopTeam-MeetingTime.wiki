__TOC__

Please indicate in your column which times in UTC you would be available to meet by placing an "x" in the appropriate cells. Please be flexible in defining times when you would be available, as we have staff around the world. So if there is a reasonable time that is outside of your normal working hours, please include that. For example, I could take an hour off between 8pm and 9pm once per week if necessary, so I included that time.

After we determine possible meeting times, we will discuss days.

There are several tools such as: http://www.timezoneconverter.com/cgi-bin/tzc.tzc
That can help you convert your local time to UTC time.
