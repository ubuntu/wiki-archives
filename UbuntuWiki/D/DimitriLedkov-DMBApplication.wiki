Hello, my name is DimitriLedkov and this is my Developer Membership Board application.

I am a 24 years old professional open-source developer. I have become Ubuntu Contributing developer ( DimitriLedkov/ContributorApplication ) in 2010, later I became Debian Developer and in 2012 I became Ubuntu Core Developer ( DimitriLedkov/CoreDevApplication ).

In my spare time, I play for LSKVC Fireball team in the London League. In the past, I have also refereed National Volleyball League and held various tutoring positions in University and high school (mainly in mathematics & physics).

When sponsoring, I tend to look for a few things: consistency, maintainability and compliance with relevant policies (e.g. both from Ubuntu, Debian and general hacking etiquette).
In addition to technical excellence, I hope that all Ubuntu Developers are approachable, agile and have positive attitude towards each other.

For further details about my involvement in the Ubuntu Community please see my launchpad page <nowiki>[[http://launchpad.net/~xnox]]</nowiki>. If you have any questions or comments do not hesitate to contact me.

I hope you will consider voting for me. 

Regards,

Dimitri.
