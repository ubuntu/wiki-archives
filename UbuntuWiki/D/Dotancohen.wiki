__TOC__

I see that my Launchpad profile points to my own wiki page. How fun!

I'm no programer, but I am a heavy user of everything that I use. So I make myself useful by filing bugs. My everyday apps are Firefox, Thunderbird, Open Office, and KDE (specifically Kontact, Konquerer, KnowIt, and Kate).
