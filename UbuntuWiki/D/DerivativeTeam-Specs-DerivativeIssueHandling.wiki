=== Summary ===

Gather and document best practices for handling crash and issues reports for Ubuntu derivative distributions.  Implement these practices by extending existing Ubuntu tools.

* Forwarding bugs to the Ubuntu issue tracker from derivative distribution's issue tracker. 
* Monitoring crash and issue report in Ubuntu's issue tracker from derivatives' issues trackers. 

=== Rationale ===
