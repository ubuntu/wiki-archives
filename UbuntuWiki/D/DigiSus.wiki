Hi, my name is Marcus Dapp. I am a happy ubuntu user since Hoary Hedgehog. I am also thinking about free software in my daily work -- doing a PhD about software patent policy's effects on innovation on free/open source software. But IANAL! I maintain a very low-traffic blog at http://www.digisus.info.
