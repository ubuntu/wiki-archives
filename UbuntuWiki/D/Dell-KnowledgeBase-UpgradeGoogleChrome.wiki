=== Which version of Google Chrome has this issue ===

=== Solution ===

 <nowiki>[[File:update-failed.png]]</nowiki>

* Please ignore the warning messages, and run first full upgrade, the Google Chome keeps outdated.
* '''Software Updater''' will inform the user that there are still packages to upgrade, and the user finally got the latest Google Chrome.

=== Details of the issue ===
Google hosts an archive for the Chrome package, and Google keeps updating the GPG key of the archive. That will block the user with the archive key in the old chrome package. 

Canonical introduces a new package oem-somerville-partner-archive-keyring to ship the partner's keyring, including the latest keyring for the  Google Chrome archive. The new package will and only be installed in the factory image, which will be pulled by upgrading the somerville-meta package.

==== Under the hood ====
0. After the OOBE, the user has an outdated Chrome and a deprecated archive key installed.
* apt-get fails, because it can not validate the Google archive.
* apt-get upgrade installs the new somerville-meta and oem-somerville-partner-archive-keyring on demand, which has the google archive key.
* The user can access the google archive without the apt error. The user can upgrade to the latest chrome version after an apt upgrade.
