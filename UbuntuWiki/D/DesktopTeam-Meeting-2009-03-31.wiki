Currently open stable/milestoned bugs:

* Bug:344688 (New PostgreSQL bug fix microreleases: 8.3.7, 8.1.17): in -proposed
* Bug:346078 (do not announce ath_pci in jockey on systems where ath5k is running): planned for this week

==== Sebastien Bacher (seb128) ====
* spent the week in the London office with robert_ancell who just
started, showed him how we are working, discussed work split, etc
* jaunty beta iso testing
* looked again at what we could win on the CD, splited the gnomeprint
and gtksourceview binaries in gnome-python-desktop so libgnomeprint,
libgnomeprintui and libgtksourceview could be moved out of the CD, the
space win is small, that could break depends for third party packages
and those libs are still build depends and need to stay in main so the
win is not really worth the trouble, we will do that following the
debian changes next cycle rather
* updated notify-osd and pygtksourceview to jaunty
* lot of bug triage after beta, fixed some desktop issues in jaunty
* sponsoring: gnome-applets pidgin gnome-media gnome-games seahorse
gnome-games pidgin-libnotify libunique

switching on my d630, not luck with valgrind but got stacktrace for the
exa crash and a different uxa one

==== Till Kamppeter (tkamppeter) ====

* Finished adding apport hooks to the printing-related packages which did not get treated before the beta (bug #338442).
* Fixed PPD file update script in all packages providing PPD files. It showed (harmless) error messages if their were PPDs without CUPS queue in /etc/cups/ppd (bug #345866)
* Fixed command line option handling and custom option support in foomatic-filters, I hope this is the last fix for Jaunty and upstream Foomatic 4.0.1 (bug #338999)
* Prepared SRU for foo2zjs (did not handle custom paper sizes in PDF printing workflow, bug #351630)
* Fixed names for Ricoh and OEM printers in Gutenprint (upstream and Jaunty) so that there are no duplicate listings of the printers models in the printer setup tools.
* Uploaded several fixes in system-config-printer and hal-cups-utils after the beta freeze: Adaptation to HPLIP 3.9.2, assure that driver choice of new printer wizard and Plug'n'Print is the same.
* Re-uploaded HPLIP unchanged to overcome Python bug on build server.
