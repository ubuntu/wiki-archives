My name is Dražen Odobašić, I'm a student at <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Zagreb_Faculty_of_Geodesy|Faculty of Geodesy in Zagreb, Croatia]]</nowiki>. My main interests are geoinformatics and any spatial related subjects.
I use mostly free software and open formats, but sometimes there are no alternatives. :(

I've started using different Linux distributions by the end of year 2002, but now I'm focused on Ubuntu. I like Ubuntu mostly because of it's lively and vibrant community spiced with just enough boldness and desire to make a difference in this predefined proprietary world.
