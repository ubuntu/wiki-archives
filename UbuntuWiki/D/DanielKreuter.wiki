=== About Me ===

My name is Daniel, I am 25 years old and using Linux for ~3-4 years now. After testing lots of distributions (I think that I'm very experienced in installing my OS new as often as I did that the last few years) I decided that Ubuntu fits best my needs. Because I thought to give the community something back I decided to join the Ubuntu Team and develop something for it (nothing special in my mind yet, we need to find something soon maybe I'll fix some bugs first).

==== Socially ====

I try to keep me (a little bit) fit with my bicycle and sometimes I meet my friends for some drinks and fun.

==== Professionally ====

From 2006-2009 I made an education as an application development specialist. After that I started my study on computer science (now in the 4th semester of 6) At the university I'm also working as a tutor in programming (Java) so if someone needs help with Java don't hesitate and ask me.

==== Skills ====

* C/C++
* Java
* (X)HTML
* litte bit Python
* bit of PHP
* Oracle DB / MySQL

==== Internet Relay Chat ====

My registered IRC nickname is xardas008.  I am looking forward to getting to know the Ubuntu community members better through this medium.  I am usually present in the following channels:

 {*} #ubuntu-beginners

 {*} #ubuntu-beginners-dev 

 {*} #ubuntu-beginners-team

 {*} #ubuntu
 
 {*} #speechcontrol

 {*} #speechcontrol-devel

 {*} #speechcontrol-offtopic
