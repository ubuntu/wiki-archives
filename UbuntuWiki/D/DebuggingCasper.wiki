== Debugging casper (booting the live CD) ==

=== casper and kernel log files ===
For debugging casper please boot with the boot option (e.g. kernel line in grub or append line in isolinux) "debug=". At the live CD boot menu, press F6 and add <code>debug=</code> to the list of parameters:
<pre>
append  file=/cdrom/preseed/ubuntu.seed boot=casper initrd=/casper/initrd.gz debug=
</pre>
Removing <code>quiet</code> and <code>splash</code> is generally a good idea when debugging.

The debug log file is /casper.log inside the initrd temporary filesystem, but will be copied to /var/log/casper.log in the fully booted system. The kernel log will be in /var/log/dmesg.log. If the system does not boot up, retrieving the log files for attaching to the bug report can be an exercise of its own:

# plug in an usb stick
# watch the kernel messages and look for the partition on the stick, for instance /dev/sdb1
# or check with <code>ls /dev/sd*</code> if you can recognize it
# <code>mkdir /tmp/stick</code>
# <code>mount /dev/sdb1 /tmp/stick</code>
# <code>cp /casper.log /tmp/stick/</code>
# <code>dmesg > /tmp/stick/dmesg.txt</code>
# <code>umount /tmp/stick</code>
# unplug the stick and give us the files casper.log and dmesg.txt!

Failing this, a photograph of the screen (hopefully with some relevant error messages) can be of help.

=== hacking the initrd ===

If you would like to change things in the initrd for debugging purposes, and without having to remaster a CD, see CustomizeLiveInitrd.
