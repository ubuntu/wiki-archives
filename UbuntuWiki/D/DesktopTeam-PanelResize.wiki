__TOC__

In some of the reviews of the Gutsy desktop one thing that was mentioned is that the panel resized poorly.  Curious (as I've never resized my panel before) I took it to the extreme (96px) just to see what would happen:

Not pretty.  Basically the only icons handling the resizing correctly are the links to other apps, the show desktop and the trash can.  Eww.

Here is the screenshot with some more applets.

The interesting thing here is how the different applets work with the space.  Almost none of them handle it in the most obvious way.  It looks like some of the icons, specifically the force quit icon, seem to be getting larger but not to the full size of the panel.

What's also kinda fun is that you can notice that the Firefox icon from the first screen shot has shifted, and now is under the "System" menu.  Now clicking on the system menu opens Firefox:
