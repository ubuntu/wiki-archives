== Ubuntu Server Guide - Specification - Saucy ==

We are proposing the following:

1. Developing and publishing the Guide based on the ''rolling release'' model.  This implies:
** Official releases of the Guide will be LTS-only
** Unofficial publications based on ''snapshots'' of the interim development branch (available online)

1. Removing ''String Freeze'' and publishing links to some languages on help.ubuntu.com.  This implies:
** A more flexible and realistic cooperation between contributors, committers, and translators
** All translations may not be published in the snapshots

Rationale:

# The development work being done every 6 months is not worth the administrative overhead required.  Community involvement is simply not enough to warrant a publication every 6 months.
# Ubuntu Server installations tend to be LTS anyway.
# Based on observation, translators find the current string freeze schedule too tight.
