__TOC__

I propose that Ubuntu uses the default clearlooks theme/colourscheme for two main reasons:

1) It will greatly simplify the pooling of documentation resources in regard to screenshots. This way screenshots can be taken from any distribution and pasted into our documentation (assuming permission), greatly reducing the time and effort it takes to document a new gnome feature, for example. 

2) It allows greater consistency across gnome distributions, as pointed out here: http://www.gnome.org/~davyd/gnome-2-12/
