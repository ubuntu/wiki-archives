=== About me ===

 '''irc:''' dieudo on irc.freenode.net

 '''Backgrounder:''' I'm 40 this year, French, living with my family near Bordeaux, France. I work as an airline pilot on Airbus 340. Since a few years I become more and more aware of the power within the copyleft attitude. And as soon as I discovered the beauty of <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Communication|Nonviolent Communication]]</nowiki> (NVC), I started to build a bridge between theses two communities, as it is obvious for me the same kind of spirit is inside. For example, I started this website : http://nvc-europe.org/SPIP/ using <nowiki>[[http://www.spip.net|SPIP]]</nowiki>. More details at <nowiki>[[http://dieudo.dyndns.org|La Soleïade]]</nowiki>.

=== Request ===

Looking for people knowing both <nowiki>[[http://www.shuttleworthfoundation.org|Shuttleworth foundation]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Communication|Nonviolent Communication]]</nowiki>, and who would like to merge theses energies.

Something looking like this here :
