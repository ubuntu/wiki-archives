=== Summary ===

This blueprint proposes a small package of tools that will help people that use or create torrent files using Ubuntu. 

=== Release Note ===

This section should include a paragraph describing the end-user impact of this change.  It is meant to be included in the release notes of the first release in which it is implemented.  (Not all of these will actually be included in the release notes, at the release manager's discretion; but writing them is a useful exercise.)

It is mandatory.

=== Rationale ===

There is currently no package in Ubuntu that gives you tools which can aid the creation, use and modification of bit-torrent files. As bit-torrent becomes more wide-spread it would be useful to have a collection of tools to help with this.

=== Use Cases ===

=== Assumptions ===

=== Design ===

torrent-tools would be a small debian package consisting of several tools. These should all be command line based.

mktorrent - A script which allows you to create torrents 

torrent-info - A script which lists torrent meta-data like the files included and trackers referenced in the file.

seeders - A script which queries a torrents tracker for the amount of seeders and leechers

=== Implementation ===

This should be implemented in a scripting language like Python to easily allow people to customise the tools for their own specific needs. All of the scripts should be based around the same library.
