Greetings,

I have been a Linux enthusiast since 1999.  My journey started with Red Hat 5.2 and Caldera's  Linux distribution around that same time frame.  I have installed and used FreeBSD, Debian, Mandrake, Slackware, and Ubuntu operating systems.  I found that Debian was the most appropriate for me and my particular taste as a User and beginning Developer.  I used Debian exclusively for about three years before transitioning the Ubuntu in 2004.  Recently I have been using Xubuntu at work, and on my Thinkpad X31.
