== Introduction ==

Hi all.

My name in Daniele and I'm from Italy.

I've been using Ubuntu for about 2 years, and I'm pretty proud of it.

I've discovered Lubuntu not long ago, and I've adopted it for my old pc (a pc that is 8 years old!!!) and it works pretty fine.

My work make me utilize some obsolete software on obsolete platforms (someone remembers something like COBOL? sigh), so I decided to keep myself "up to date" learning how to contribute in an open project. Lubuntu dev fits this need pretty well.

Every friendly advice and indication on how to make the first steps, will be warmly welcome by my side.

I think I have a lot to learn, and I'm sure to find some high skilled developers to help me out!

Thank you for your time to read this!
