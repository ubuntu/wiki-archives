=== About Me ===

My screen name is simply my last name.  It seems that no matter who I know, work for etc I always end up being called dendle.  So for the longest time it is my nick for almost everything web-related that I am involved in.  

I have been using Ubuntu since Breezy Badger back in 2005.  It shares a place in my digital life with my Mac, and Win..machines.  I have been using Unix since my undergrad days back in the early 90's (even learnt PDP8 programming for what that was worth).  Currently I am running Ubuntu 9.10 on my Toshiba laptop, and loving it.  

My start in Unix and Web Development began in 1993, when I managed parts of my Faculties website.  I am an old man in the world of web development.  I remember when HTML tables was released and that was a big deal!!!  I remember when dynamic websites could really only be developed using Perl, and Windows had no equvilent web application solutions (ahhhh glory days).

I have been working IT for many years now.  Here is a quick Synopsis:

1. IT Support
2. University Tutor
3. University Lecturer (undergraduate and postgraduate)
4. Multimedia Programmer
5. Web Applications Developer (specialising in Oracle, PHP and JAVA)
6. Business Analyst
7. Project Manager

Currently I run my own small IT Support Business.  This means that I have time on my hands to finally be able to join and contribute to the Ubuntu Community.  It had always been my goal but I knew that I did not have the time.  Well now I do :)

=== Documentation Background ===

I have a love for document/technical writing.  In my past roles I have been responsible for writing to Senior Management, End users and clients.  Some examples of documents I have co-authored are the following (note: these documents were aimed at a web authoring/publishing community of around 250 staff):

1. Publishing Web Addresses Policy
2. Web Collection Management Policy
3. Web Collection Management Policy Schedule 1: Roles & Responsibilities in Managing Web Content 
4. Web Collection Management Policy Schedule 2: Expiration of Web Records and Content 
5. Web Services Naming Policy
6. Web Services Naming Policy Schedule 1: Operational Guidelines & Procedures

I have also been responsible for / involved in the testing phases of websites for commercial vendors.  For some sites it was User Acceptance testing of the site (content, structure etc), and others it was the design/look'n'feel testing down to the pixel (This was for a large global fast food chain).  And of course I have written that many Project Plans, Analysis Documents etc .....
