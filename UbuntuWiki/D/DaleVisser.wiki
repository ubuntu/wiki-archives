=== About Name ===
Former physicist, now an IT systems researcher.

==== Learning ====
Ph.D. in Physics (2003), B.Sci. in Physics, Applied Computer Science and Applied Statistics (1996)
==== Use ====
Currently use Lubuntu 13.10 and Peppermint 3. In the past I've used regular Ubuntu, as far back as Breezy, as recent as Quantal. Just prior to Lubuntu, I was using Ubuntu Gnome 13.04 in a VM. Since turning on 3D accelaration in the VM was problematic, Gnome 3 performance suffered. Hence, my foray into Lubuntu, since I had already been installing Peppermint 3 (another LXDE-using Ubuntu offshoot) on my daughter's and wife's computers.

=== Why using Ubuntu? ===
I like the basic concept of core Debian stability and package management, with extra developer effort added to support commercial and closed source where necessary to get something running well.
