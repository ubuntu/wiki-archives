== Rationale ==

The download manager allows the client to provide the hash and the algorithm used to calculate it. Those two values are passed as a string and the download manager is not case sensitive, that is Md5 and md5 are the same.
== Valid values ==

The following are the valid algorithms used by the download manager to calculate the hash of a download.

* Md5
* Sha1
* Sha224
* Sha256
* Sha384
* Sha512
