 Using ubuntu on a Sony Vaio Laptop. 

 I have used several forms of Linux including: 
* Red Hat
* Suse
* UNIX (on the IBM RS6000)
* Corel (ugh)
* Debian
* FreeBSD

 However I am not where I would like to be. I am a user not a power user. Guess that is why I am trying to get involved in the forums. ;-)
