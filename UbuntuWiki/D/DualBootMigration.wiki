This section discusses the procedures for dual booting your hardware.

Many people cannot simply throw their Windows applications away
and migrate to Ubuntu overnight. The best method for those people
is a Dual Boot Scenario.

'''Dual boot''' means the computer will have both the old operating system in it, which you can keep on using, plus the new Ubuntu operating system, and you can choose which operating sytem to boot up.

If you are planning to start from scratch, that is, you plan to use a new physical drive for the 'Dual boot', then install Windows first and leave about half the drive space for Ubuntu. 

 Obtaining the Ubuntu Installation ISO/CD:: 
** Obtain the Ubuntu Installation CD from here <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntulinux.org/getubuntu/download|Here]]</nowiki> <<BR>>
  Don't get the latest version if it has been released within the last 60 days as you want one that has been around for a while and had most of the kinks worked out of it.<<BR>>
  Don't get an Alpha or Beta version either.<<BR>>
  Check the integrity of any downloaded .iso images using the md5sum command. A bad .iso image not only means a bad CD it also means lost time and frustration.
** Burn the .iso image. You can find an .iso burning howto <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BurningIsoHowto|Here]]</nowiki>
** You can also order a CD <nowiki>[[https://shipit.ubuntu.com/|From Here]]</nowiki>
** Run the Windows defragmentation tool on C:
 Resizing Disk Partitions:: Your current Windows installation probably uses all of the available disk space on your physical drive as your Windows C: drive, so you will need to resize the Windows partition so you end up with two partitions, one with your current Windows installation and one for your new Ubuntu installation.
 Resizing With Windows Vista::
** Windows Vista can shrink its own partition without the need to use third-party software. See '''<nowiki>[[http://www.vistarewired.com/2007/02/16/how-to-resize-a-partition-in-windows-vista|this link]]</nowiki>'''. If you are running Windows Vista, shrink your Vista partition using that method. The Ubuntu installer will use the free space you created for your new Ubuntu OS.
 Resizing Partitions Using the Ubuntu Installer:: The Ubuntu Installer has several partitioning methods. The easiest is to allow the installer to free up space by resizing your Windows partition. This is covered later in the procedure.
 Begin Ubuntu Installation::
** Once you have the CD, insert it into your CD-ROM drive and reboot your PC.<<BR>>
  If the computer does not boot from the CD (eg. Windows starts again instead), check your BIOS settings and alter them accordingly so the CD will boot up.
** The first image you will see is the Language Selection Menu<<BR>>
   <nowiki>[[File:UbuntuInstallLangSelection.png]]</nowiki><<BR>>
  Use the arrow keys to Highlight your preferred language and press <ENTER>

** The next you will see the Ubuntu Install menu<<BR>>
   <nowiki>[[File:UbuntuInstallerMenu.png]]</nowiki><<BR>>
  Select '''Install Ubuntu''' and press <ENTER>

** Next you should see a Progress Bar as the system prepares to launch the installer.<<BR>>
   <nowiki>[[File:UbuntuInstallerProgressBar.png]]</nowiki><<BR>>
  The Progress Bar will display until the installer is ready to start up and ask several questions about the installation.

** After the Progress Bar displays for a while, your screen may go blank for a few seconds then the installation questions will start with the Welcome and Language Selection Screen<<BR>> 
   <nowiki>[[File:UbuntuInstallerQuest1LangSelection.png]]</nowiki><<BR>>
  Use the arrow keys to Highlight your preferred language and select the <Forward> Button

** Next you will be asked to select the Time Zone<<BR>>
   <nowiki>[[File:UbuntuInstallerQuest2TimeZoneSelection.png]]</nowiki><<BR>>
  Use your mouse to access the drop down menu and Select your city and Time Zone<<BR>>
  Then Select the <Forward> Button

** Next you will be asked to select your Keyboard Layout<<BR>>
   <nowiki>[[File:UbuntuInstallerQuest3KeybLangSelection.png]]</nowiki><<BR>>
  Use the mouse and arrow keys to select your Keyboard layout and then select the <Forward> Button

** After selecting the Keyboard layout and selecting the <Forward> Button you will see the following indicating that the Linux partitioner is obtaining information about your hard disk<<BR>>
   <nowiki>[[File:UbuntuInstallerPartitionerStartupScreen.png]]</nowiki>

** When the Partitioner completes it will display something similar to the following indicating how the Ubuntu Installer plans to repartition your disk space to allow Windows and Ubuntu to coexist on the same physical disk.<<BR>>
   <nowiki>[[File:UbuntuInstallerPrepareDiskSpace.png]]</nowiki>

  This step is the most important step as it re-partitions your hard drive.<<BR>>
  The best method is to allow the Ubuntu Installer to figure out what free space is available and where to put the Ubuntu OS. This method is referred to as the '''Guided resize''' method.
   However, the Partitioner will be very greedy here and resize the Windows partition to only the amount of disk space Windows is currently using. This is probably not what you want to occur.
   You can adjust the size of both the Windows and Ubuntu partitions by doing the following:
    
   Place your mouse cursor on the hash marks between the two partitions as shown below until a double headed arrow appears
   <nowiki>[[File:UbuntuInstallerResizeHashMarks.png]]</nowiki><<BR>>

   When the double header arrow appears press and hold the Left mouse button and drag it to the right, reducing the Ubuntu partition size and increasing the Windows partition size. You can play with this until you are satisfied with the size of each partition. When you are satisfied with the size of both partitions release the Left mouse button.<<BR>>

   Note that as you resize using the mouse cursor the color bars in the '''After''' graphic will also change.

   Here is a view after resizing Windows and Ubuntu so each has about 50% of the available disk space.
   <nowiki>[[File:UbuntuInstallerResizeDiskFinal.png]]</nowiki><<BR>>

   When you are satisfied with the sizes of the Windows and Ubuntu partitions you can, <<BR>>
   Select the <Forward> Button

** You will receive the following Warning about the changes you are about to make to the hard drive
   <nowiki>[[File:UbuntuInstallerWritePartitionSizeChanges.png]]</nowiki><BR>>
   You can select '''Continue''' on the warning form.

** Next you may see this message while the partitioner resizes your hard disk<<BR>>
   <nowiki>[[File:UbuntuInstallerDiskResizePleaseWaitMsg.png]]</nowiki>

** When the partitioner completes the hard disk resizing you will be presented with the following Identification Screen
   <nowiki>[[File:UbuntuInstallerEnterNamePasswd.png]]</nowiki><<BR>>
   Fill in all the fields on the form, leave '''Log in automatically''' Unchecked<<BR>> <<BR>>

   Here is an example of a completed Identification Form<<BR>>
   <nowiki>[[File:UbuntuInstallerCompletedIdForm.png]]</nowiki><<BR>>
  Select the <Forward> Button

** After the Identification Form is completed the Import Settings form shown below will be displayed.
   <nowiki>[[File:UbuntuInstallerImportSettingsForm.png]]</nowiki><<BR>>
   Selecting one of the listed accounts will cause the installer to import 'Documents and Settings' for the particular account and make them available after the installation.<<BR>>
   When you have completed the form,
   Select the <Forward> Button<<BR>>

** The last screen to display is a Summary of the installation choices shown below. <<BR>>
   <nowiki>[[File:UbuntuInstallerSummaryFinalStep.png]]</nowiki><<BR>>
   The most important section of this page is the area explaining what partitions will be formatted and how each will be used. It is imperative that you understand disk drive partitioning to be able to interpret what actions will be performed on your hard drive.

   Review the Summary and when you are satisfied with what actions will be taken to install Ubuntu, then<<BR>>
   Select the <Install> Button<<BR>>
   And the Ubuntu Installation process will begin
   
** After a few seconds you should see the disk partitioning progress bar shown below.<<BR>>
   <nowiki>[[File:UbuntuInstallerPartitionDiskProgressBar.png]]</nowiki> <<BR>>
   The disk partition progress bar may be displayed momentarily or may be displayed for 2 to N seconds, depending on the size you chose for the Ubuntu partition.

** Next an '''Installing system''' progress bar similar to the following will display<<BR>>
   <nowiki>[[File:UbuntuInstallerInstallingSystemProgressBar.png]]</nowiki><<BR>>
   The Installing System Window will be displayed until the Ubuntu OS has been installed.

** When the Ubuntu OS has been installed your will see the 'Installation complete' message Window shown below<<BR>>
   <nowiki>[[File:UbuntuInstallerInstallationCompleteMsg.png]]</nowiki><<BR>>
   Select <Restart now> Button

** Your machine will reboot and present you with a Grub menu similar to the following<<BR>>
   <nowiki>[[File:UbuntuInstallerPostInstallGrubBootMenu.png]]</nowiki><<BR>>

   Note!! That your kernel entry should not be listed as a '''development branch''' if you installed the latest stable Ubuntu release.<<BR>>
   
   At this point you can choose to boot the Ubuntu OS (the default because it is highlighted) or the Windows OS. To accept the default Ubuntu OS press <Enter>. To boot the Windows OS use the arrow keys to move the highlight to the Windows OS entry and press <Enter>

  Either OS should now boot up and run properly.
