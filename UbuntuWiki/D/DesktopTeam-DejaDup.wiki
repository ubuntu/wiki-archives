== Déjà Dup in Ubuntu ==

This page covers details about how the Desktop Team takes care of the deja-dup and duplicity packages.  (Duplicity is the backup commandline tool that Déjà Dup uses.)

=== Upstream Schedule ===

Déjà Dup follows GNOME's six month release schedule, though it uses its own numbering scheme.  For example, 21.x is GNOME 3.3.x and 22.x is GNOME 3.4.x.

Duplicity releases on its own schedule.  There is no particularly semantic numbering scheme.

=== Acceptance Criteria ===

==== deja-dup Testing ====

# make check (automatic unit tests)
# Make fresh backup into Ubuntu One.  Restore back and compare files.

==== duplicity Testing ====

# ./testing/run-tests (automatic test suite)
# Make fresh backup into Ubuntu One.  Restore back and compare files.
# Make fresh backup into local drive.  Restore back and compare files.
# Run the deja-dup test plan above with the new duplicity installed
