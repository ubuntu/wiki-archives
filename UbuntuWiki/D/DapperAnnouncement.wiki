Subject: Announcing Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

The Ubuntu team is proud to announce the release of Ubuntu 6.06 LTS, 
codenamed "Dapper Drake". This release includes both installable 
Desktop CDs and alternate text-mode installation CDs for several
architectures, for Ubuntu, Kubuntu and Edubuntu.

Ubuntu is a Linux distribution for your desktop or server, with a 
fast and easy install, regular releases, a tight selection of 
excellent packages installed by default, every other package you can
imagine available with a few clicks from a global network of mirrors,
and professional commercial technical support from Canonical Ltd and
hundreds of other companies around the world.

Ubuntu 6.06 LTS will be the first Ubuntu release with a long-term 
support cycle: free security updates and commercial technical support 
will be available for three years on the desktop, and five years on 
the server.

About Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
---------------------

Highlights of this release include:

 On the Desktop CD

** A new, very fast, graphical installer based on the Live CD

** Faster system startup and login

** Simplified menu organization

** Graphical shutdown process

** Easy access to power management settings with GNOME Power 
    Manager (Ubuntu)

** Improved support for video playback

** Optional NetworkManager for convenient roaming between different
    wireless and wired networks

** OpenOffice.org 2.0.2, X.org 7.0

** Support for ongoing translation updates throughout the life of
    this release, for all supported desktop environments

 On the Server

** New kernels targeted at server platforms. The server kernels are 
    tuned differently than the desktop kernels (providing better 
    performance for server applications).

** Both low-end and "big iron" server kernels. The low-end 
    server kernel is generic, and should work on the same equipment 
    that the desktop kernel runs on. The high-end server kernel is 
    geared towards systems with greater than 8 CPUs (ES7000 / Summit
    / BIGSMP).

** Turn-key LAMP installation for this common deployment scenario

** Improved support for clusters and SANs

** Thin client enhancements, including faster client startup,
    graphical boot process, reduced memory requirements, and sound
    device support

 Localization

** Automatic setup of non-Latin input methods

** Menu item translations included in language packs, for faster 
    integration of new and updated translations provided through
    Rosetta

** Ongoing translation updates from the Rosetta web service:

      https://launchpad.net/distro/ubuntu/dapper/+translations

 Installation and Upgrades

** Ubuntu can now be installed to USB devices, such as removable
    hard drives and flash memory, using the text-mode installer

** A new upgrade tool is available, for simple, clean and reliable
    upgrades from one Ubuntu release to the next, starting with 
    Ubuntu 5.10

** The alternate installer now runs in a single stage, rebooting
    straight into the complete system. This makes it faster,
    simpler, and more reliable.

 "Under the hood"

** GCC 4.0.3

** glibc 2.3.6

** Linux 2.6.15.6

** New live CD infrastructure for improved performance, usability and 
    space-efficiency

** Greatly improved infrastructure for automatic hardware detection and activation

** The system PATH is now set in exactly one place, /etc/environment, for
    convenient administration

As always, Ubuntu includes the very best of the 100% Free / Libre 
application software world, and each new release incorporates 
countless new features and bugfixes from the global development 
community. More detailed release notes are at
