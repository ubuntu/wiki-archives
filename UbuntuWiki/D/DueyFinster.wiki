=== Introduction ===
Welcome to my Ubuntu Wiki Page. I am Neil Grogan, owner of the alias Duey Finster. I run the latest Ubuntu and have Kubuntu and Xubuntu installed aswell. I am from and live in Ireland. I am very fond of (in no particular order): debating, computers, Ubuntu (You can't tell?), my family, music, computer games, consoles, Ireland and I could go on forever!
