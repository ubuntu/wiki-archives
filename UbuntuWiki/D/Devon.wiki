=== User Informations ===
Hi all, I'm a Computer Science student from the north of Italy.

I like going for a ride with my bicycle, playing with friends and helping others (yeah, mostly with computers...).

I hope to help with my time and skills in translating software, and hopefully developing useful things, as well.

* Italian (primary language)
