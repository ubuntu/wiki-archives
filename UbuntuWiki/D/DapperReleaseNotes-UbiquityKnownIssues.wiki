== Known Ubiquity issues in Ubuntu 6.06 LTS ==

(Ubiquity is the new graphical installer on the Desktop CD.)

* Problems when LVM or RAID are active:

 If you are installing from the Desktop CD on a system that already has one or more RAID arrays or LVM volume groups set up, you must disable the arrays (`sudo /etc/init.d/mdadm stop; sudo mdadm --stop --scan`) and volume groups (`sudo vgchange -a n`) before starting the installer.

* Boot loader installation on powerpc:

 When installing from the Desktop CD on powerpc and using manual partitioning, you may experience problems setting up the HFS bootstrap partition required for the yaboot boot loader. You will need to deselect the bootstrap partition on the mount points page, and an error message beginning with "No New``World boot partition was found" will appear, at which you should select "Continue". If the bootstrap partition did not exist prior to starting installation, then you may need to create it using `parted` outside the installer: make sure the partition is of type `hfs`, at least 820kB in size, and has the `boot` flag set. Installations from the Desktop CD with automatic partitioning, or from the alternate install CD, do not have this problem.

 While this has not been entirely fixed yet, ubiquity 1.0.13 in dapper-updates should be a little more forgiving while handling existing HFS bootstrap partitions.

* '''[fixed in dapper-updates and edgy]''' Crash if /boot is on XFS: <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/bugs/47848|#47848]]</nowiki>

 If you use manual partitioning to select an XFS root filesystem, and if you do not create a non-XFS /boot filesystem, then the installer will crash while trying to install GRUB. This is due to some reliability problems between GRUB and XFS, exacerbated by an installer bug. The workaround is either to use a non-XFS root filesystem or to create a non-XFS /boot filesystem.

* '''[fixed in dapper-updates and edgy Knot 1]''' Crash if system partitions are not reformatted: <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/bugs/47046|#47046]]</nowiki>

 If you use manual partitioning and do not check the "Reformat?" box for filesystems you mount on /, /boot, /usr, /var, or subdirectories of those, then the installer may crash while copying files to the target system. The workaround is to make sure to reformat these filesystems (note that /home, /media/*, and so on do not need to be formatted). If you are upgrading an existing installation and want to save existing data, then you should follow the instructions in DapperUpgrades rather than using the Desktop CD's installer.

* '''[fixed in dapper-updates and edgy]''' Crash if some packages on running live session are unconfigured: <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/bugs/47859|#47859]]</nowiki>

 If you choose to install NTP support during installation, or if you tried to install a package in the live session before starting the installer but left the package incompletely installed, then the installer may crash while installing language packs. The workaround is not to choose to install NTP support during installation (it can be installed after rebooting into the newly-installed system), or not to install the offending package, or to remove any incompletely installed packages entirely using `dpkg --purge PACKAGENAME` before starting the installer.

* Translation problems in certain languages: <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/bugs/47742|#47742]]</nowiki>

 Installations from the Desktop CD in languages that do not have ".UTF-8" in their locale code (Arabic, Bengali, Hindi, Northern Sami, Persian, Punjabi, Vietnamese, Wolof) may incorrectly display English text where localised text should be available.

* '''[fixed in dapper-updates and edgy Knot 1]''' Crash when installing in Chinese but with a non-Chinese-speaking country: <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/bugs/47687|#47687]]</nowiki>

 If you select a Chinese language (either Simplified or Traditional) but then select a non-Chinese speaking country on the timezone/country selection page, the installer will crash while configuring the target system. The workaround is to select a Chinese-speaking country.

* Crash when autopartitioning and disk is too small: <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/bugs/48355|#48355]]</nowiki>

 If your disk is too small to complete an Ubuntu desktop installation (a sensible minimum is about 2.5GB), then the autopartitioner will fail to warn you about this, and instead the installer will crash while copying files.

* '''[fixed in dapper-updates and edgy Knot 1]''' Crash with certain kinds of disk attached: <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/bugs/48732|#48732]]</nowiki>

 Disks with non-ASCII (and non-UTF-8) model names cause the installer to crash while initialising the automatic partitioner. This seems to be particularly common with USB drives; removing them during the installation may work around this problem.
