== Introduction ==

I have spent a great deal of my life serving others.  As a retiree of the U.S. Navy, husband, and father of 4, doing for others has always been part of my life.  While certainly a lot of work, it has been, and continues to be quite rewarding.

I have always been they type of person that wanted to know how things work.  From my earliest memories, I was taking my dad's tools and taking things apart to see how they worked.  Sometimes I even got them back together and working again. I would have to say that love of learning how things work, and basically being able to tinker with things is what drew me to Linux.

I used my first Linux distro in 2004.  Having been using proprietary software, I wanted to see what this "free software" was all about.  My first foray into Linux was Mandrake (as it was called at the time.)  While it was certainly different than the proprietary software I was used to using, learning something new was quite exciting. Over the years, I tried out quite a few flavors of Linux.  With our kids growing and wanted to use computers, I found that I simply did not want to spend the money on proprietary software if I could avoid it. I remember reading a news article that a major electronics chain store had started selling laptops with a version of Linux pre-installed.  It was a flavor I had not heard of before, so I went to the website for the distro.  I downloaded a copy of Ubuntu and installed in on a test box of mine.  After about 10 minutes of playing around with it, I called my wife and told her this is the software that will make it to all our computers.  The rest is history, as they say. 
== Community Involvement ==

I have only recently became involved with the community.  Thanks to the more than helpful folks in the community, I expect to become much more active and contribute greatly to the community.

== Future Hopes ==

In the short term, I hope to see my last child born happy and healthy, (s)he's due Feb 2012.  I also hope to become a valuable contributor to this great Ubuntu community as quickly as possible.

In the longer term, I would like to become intimately familiar with as much of the inner workings of the Ubuntu project as possible.
