About:
All my life i have used Windows, but now i've seen the light :D
I'm in love with open-source/cross-platform applications and of course, i'm a big fan of the Ubuntu OS. I want to help the community as much as i can, so i'm in the Ubuntu Romanian Translators team, also if you happen to need an Ubuntu cd and you are in Constanta, drop by :)
