=== Summary ===

The <nowiki>[[http://www.dmtf.org/|DMTF (Distributed Management Task Force)]]</nowiki> has defined a set of management open standards :
* <nowiki>[[http://www.dmtf.org/standards/wbem/|WBEM (Web Based Enterprise Management)]]</nowiki>: a set of management and Internet standard technologies developed to unify the management of distributed computing environments. WBEM provides the ability for the industry to deliver a well-integrated set of standard-based management tools, facilitating the exchange of data across otherwise disparate technologies and platforms.
* <nowiki>[[http://www.dmtf.org/standards/cim/|CIM (Common Information Model)]]</nowiki>: provides a common definition of management information for systems, networks, applications and services, and allows for vendor extensions. CIM’s common definitions enable vendors to exchange semantically rich management information between systems throughout the network.
* <nowiki>[[http://www.dmtf.org/standards/mgmt/cdm/|CDM (Common Diagnostic Model)]]</nowiki>: As an extension of CIM, the CDM specification is widely used within the industry to evaluate the health of computer systems in multi-vendor environments. CDM creates diagnostic instrumentation that can be utilized by platform management applications, and its tight synergy with the other manageability domains in CIM further enables integration of diagnostics into critical management functions.
* <nowiki>[[http://www.dmtf.org/standards/mgmt/smash/|SMASH Systems Management Architecture for Server Hardware)]]</nowiki>: is a suite of specifications that deliver architectural semantics, industry standard protocols and profiles to unify the management of the data center.
* <nowiki>[[http://www.dmtf.org/standards/smbios/|SMBIOS (System Management BIOS)]]</nowiki>: addresses how motherboard and system vendors present management information about their products in a standard format by extending the BIOS interface on x86 architecture systems. The information is intended to allow generic instrumentation to deliver this information to management applications that use DMI, CIM or direct access, eliminating the need for error prone operations like probing system hardware for presence detection.

The first 2 are a bare minimum we need to implement.

=== Release Note ===

[x,y,z] are now supported on Ubuntu Server Edition, allowing users to use these DMTF specification to manage their servers

=== Rationale ===

DMTF implementation is required by many management platforms used on server.  DMTF include most (if not all) hardware vendors as well as virtualization software vendors.  All major server distro implement at least CIM and WBEM.

=== Use Cases ===

=== Assumptions ===

=== Design ===

You can have subsections that better describe specific parts of the issue.

=== Implementation ===

This section should describe a plan of action (the "how") to implement the changes discussed. Could include subsections like:

==== UI Changes ====

Should cover changes required to the UI, or specific UI that is required to implement this

==== Code Changes ====

Code changes should include an overview of what needs to change, and in some cases even the specific details.

==== Migration ====

Include:
* data migration, if any
* redirects from old URLs to new ones, if any
* how users will be pointed to the new way of doing things, if necessary.

=== Test/Demo Plan ===

It's important that we are able to test new features, and demonstrate them to users.  Use this section to describe a short plan that anybody can follow that demonstrates the feature is working.  This can then be used during CD testing, and to show off after release.

This need not be added or completed until the specification is nearing beta.

=== Outstanding Issues ===

This should highlight any issues that should be addressed in further specifications, and not problems with the specification itself; since any specification with problems cannot be approved.

=== BoF agenda and discussion ===

Use this section to take notes during the BoF; if you keep it in the approved spec, use it for summarising what was discussed and note any options that were rejected.
