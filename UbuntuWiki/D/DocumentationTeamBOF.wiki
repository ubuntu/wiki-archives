=== A look at what we are doing: ===

==== Ubuntu Handbook + FAQ ====
* Hornbeck is leading the writing (10/15%)
* targeted at end users
* docbook
* debian packaging 
* there is also Colin installation manual

==== Work on existing documents ====

===== Manpages =====

plovs is leading the work on improving existing manpages

===== Gnome documentation =====

* Taken from gnome 2.8 documentation, trying to port it to Ubuntu/
* sivan started it
* it's available in svn
* Gnome upstream has things ready to support branding, so we may just work with them instead of forking.  Ubuntu specific things can just be included upstream and marked with a special ID that makes it not appear in Gnome docs
* We could also get working on the main baz server directly on the gnome import

=== Documentation in different language ===

Other wiki teams approached with the reSt -> Moin translation, and were generally positive with it

=== Things we could do ===

* There is documentation that is developed elsewhere we don't know about or we just happened to know (like the korean input and translation guide or the unofficial handbook)
* One other thing we could do is looking for other people writing ubuntu docs and getting in touch with them
* Add language teams to the language resources page
* Gnome docutils has an xml2po that can be used to make translating docbook easier
* Facilitate existing grassroots communities
** Tell them about each other
** Share practices and what happens
* Conglomerate exists as an XML authoring that can be used for DocBook, but it's not easy anyway
* Creating a blog for country teams to announce what they do

=== Wiki ===
* Which wiki language will we use? Moin
* Which content goes to the wiki - which in DocBook
* Cleaning up the wiki
* Contact most active language wiki people asking if they could have one for each language community subscribe to ubuntu-doc and tell they can submit things they think are good for publishing in the main website 

=== Welcome process ===

* Handled by Sivan
* There's an invitation to come document (documentation team on the main website, also linked from FrontPage)
* Sivan is approaching new people in IRC and in the mailing list
* Tried to find out ways of measure involvement of people to see if someone can have svn access or what tasks can be assigned to them

=== Docteam tools ===
* Style guide
** The Gnome Style Guide is really good and can be adopted
** Integrate trademark guidelines
** Coordinate with marketing team
* Docbook templates

=== Relationships with the translation team ===
* Offering independent translators to merge their work in the website
* There should be a list of people we could refer to for every language
* Various localization-related tasks:
** Translate documentation
** Check input methods
** Check fonts
** Check what happens and interact with local communities
** Using Rosetta
** Political correctness and similar local issues
** Deadline-related tasks (like, we finished writing it, time to translate it, and negotiate the time needed)
** Report problems that exist for that culture

* We could host translated sites

=== svn repository ===
* moving the svn server into Canonical's farm
* svn hooks: which future?
* svn accounts: formalizing the consensus, maintaining a list of who has one

=== Official website ===
* Maintenance
* Copying/moving/caring for quality  on content from the wiki to the official website
* Who manages the website?  Lulu (now) Mako (later), others and maybe some of us?
** There will be someone that can take care of the website from a programming perspective
** Mako will be there content-wise
* What can be added to the official website?
** See if the Plone helpcenter is meeting our needs and what other options are available
** This also needs to be done to evaluate the scope of the LinguaPlone translation
** There will be a total website redesign next year
** How many/what high-quality tutorials do we have?
** How many/what high-quality HOWTOs do we have?
** How many/what high-quality FAQ items do we have?
** Hot Wiki pages can be computed by seeing the amount of wiki updates that happen to them
** It would be important to see the most visited places or NOT visited places
