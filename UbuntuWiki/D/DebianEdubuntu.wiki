== Proposal for DebianEdu and Edubuntu cooperation ==
'''The proposal was to explore ways we can cooperate and create synergy between the two projects.'''
== Cooperation Items ==

* Collaboration (but how?)
** Hold a DebianEdu/Edubuntu developer gathering or through a mailist (whatever is easiest/most efficient in the first stage)
** Use <nowiki>[[http://wiki.debian.org/Utnubu|Utnubu]]</nowiki> as the Umbrella for collaboration
* Where can we collaborate:
** Packaging: i.e. Moodle
** File wishlist bugs (preferably) with patches and thus help reducing their own work later on once they do the usual Debian-unstable to Ubuntu merge.
** Create a a space (a wiki page?) for information tracking for DDs, MOTUs, Ubuntu Core devs and Upstream devs. Hopefully that will get us somewhere.
