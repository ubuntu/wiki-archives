** Should be uploaded by the end of the day.

==== Chris Halse Rogers (RAOF) ====

* Lots of Intel & Nouveau bugwork
** Went through all the lucid Intel & Nouveau bugs
*** 8xx chips are a mess, and don't look like they'll get fixed upstream soon.  Upstream has gone through a number of suspected fixes, all of which haven't been fixes.  Turning off 3D on 845 & 855, and turning of KMS on 830 should get us sufficiently stable X.
*** 9xx chips seem pretty good.  No serious wide-spread problems identified and a couple of relatively minor problems have workarounds.
*** Nouveau's tracking surprisingly well.  When it works at all, it seems to generally work quite well.  When it doesn't work at all, disabling acceleration allows systems to boot.  Nouveau as a better stepping stone to -nvidia was our goal for Lucid.
** Disable DRI on i845 & i855 Intel chips to avoid hitting serious crasher bugs (LP: #541492, LP: #541511) - awaiting sponsoring.
** Pick up upstream fix for X startup crashes on old nv cards (LP: #547124) - awaiting sponsoring.
** Create a kernel patch to allow us to quirk acceleration off on troublesome nvidia cards
*** Currently we have GeForce 3, GeForce 6100 and the 9600GT in 5th gen MacBook Pros as default-noaccel.
*** These systems fail to get to X without quirking off acceleration.
** Further investigated MacBook Pro situation; infuriatingly, disabling acceleration no longer seems enough to make them bootable.
** Chase up a possible fix for LP: #558657.  Test kernel waiting for reporter to verify fix.
* Push new gnome-keyring-sharp up to Debian; fix silly error identified in review, and sync fix back to Lucid.
* Half an hour's investigation as to why gnome-do now dies in the keyring.  Find that libgnome-keyring seems to be much less thread-safe than g-k-s was, although g-k-s wasn't thread-safe either.  Patch created, needs a little polish.  Need to wire up a similar patch for Docky.

==== Didier Roche (didrocks) ====

* UNE:
** clutk: work with njpatel to fix the errors in some languages with wrongly ordered icons (LP: #435805). Made new release and upload.
** netbook-launcher: fix duplicate desktop folder showing in the ui (LP: #554807). Made new release and upload.
** New installation and upgrade from karmic test: all seems good :)
** Try to install ubuntu-desktop on a fresh UNE install: success
** Try to install ubuntu-netbook on a fresh ubuntu desktop install: success
** lot of bug triaging. No bug too worrying for lucid release right now.
* GNOME:
** metacity: fix little dead space in the button ordering. Upload new release of metacity too.
** vala: upload stable release (0.8), still some packages that needs to be transitioned, working with maintainers.
** try to debug some g-c-c bug (hang in desktop effect). chriscoulson was finally cleverer than I on that. Some good training on valgrind too.
** Look at embarrassing bug #221112 encountered by French people keyboard layout (space is wrongly taken by rhythmbox for play/pause, forbidenning using it in search field). This is even more annoying as it impacts the music store too. After doing a lot of research (https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9529, https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xkeyboard-config/+bug/198759, https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=15804, https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-settings-daemon/+bug/324480, https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/console-setup/+bug/89835, https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-fr-l10n/2007-February/001113.html), and tried to talk with involved people it seems we can have a workaround (currently under test on my config). Still waiting to talk to upstream people has there is no ideal solution.
* Quickly:
** Fix some bugs to be ready to release 0.4 (export DEBSIGN_KEYID, tutorial issue, and ubuntu-pygame one)
** i18n new messages finally imported into LP \o/
** developing a new nautilus extension widgets and extending API (screenshots available <nowiki>[[http://people.canonical.com/~didrocks/quickly/quickly-nautilus1.png|here]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[http://people.canonical.com/~didrocks/quickly/quickly-nautilus2.png|here]]</nowiki>)
** merging debug command from Nafai
** help the two students we can have for Quickly to setup their GSoC proposal
* misc:
** completing and registring UNE default app and settings (https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/desktop-maverick-une-app-selection) and Quickly (https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/desktop-maverick-quickly/) blueprints.
** proposing OneConf (see item in https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DesktopTeam/10.10/BlueprintList)
** notation in ubuntu GSoC proposal

==== Till Kamppeter (tkamppeter) ====
* system-config-printer: Updated accidentally used unstable version 1.1.91 to 1.2.0, this caused the translation problem LP: #557199; Fixed also several problems of system-config-printer freezing when searching for printers by optimizing the use of avahi-browse (LP: #552398); Let system-config-printer prefer HPLIP instead of hpcups (LP: #553573, LP: #539708, LP: #538031, LP: #405116); Let system-config-printer only recommend avahi-utils and not depend on it (LP: #559780); Finally got the new Ubuntu logo for the test pages (LP: #542975); Made the man pages getting installed; Improvements on finding out which detected network printers are one and the same physical printer; Let Bluetooth printers get searched together with network printers, as the search takes longer. So USB and parallel printers and also network printer search     methods appear nearly instantly; In the listing of network printers let not only IP addresses but also DNS-SD names appear; do not search for drivers when setting up an IPP queue which points to a remote CUPS queue; when setting up a remote LPD printer manually let the list of detected queue names actually get filled; Do not use the tray applet when the desktop environment is LXDE (LP: #529472).
* hplip: Fixed problems with installation of the proprietary plugin on some locales (LP: #525901); Switched back to HPIJS as default driver (migrate hpcups queues to HPIJS) as there are new problems with hpcups (LP: #553573, LP: #539708, LP: #538031, LP: #405116); merged fixes from Debian; Removed duplicate PPD files for HP Color Inkjet CP1700, the one which got used was missing A3 paper size (LP: #290559); fixed auto-update of PPDs of already existing print queues; Fixed problem of hp-check depending on libcups2-dev (LP: #530327).
* Answered and triaged printing-related bug reports.
