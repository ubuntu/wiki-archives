I'm continuing my journey into the world of Ubuntu.  I've been a dedicated Mac user since. . .  well, since the Mac came into the world but have been forced to continue to use Windows for my day job. My background is in educational technology, usability and distance learning. I'm a Learning Consultant who has worked for K - 12 school districts, Universities, NASA and international petrochemical companies.

Please my named wiki page at <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BelindaLopez]]</nowiki> for my community activity.
