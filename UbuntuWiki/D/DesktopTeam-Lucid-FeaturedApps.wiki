Approach for selecting apps:

5. If there is overflow (more apps that meet criteria than slots designated) the canonical-desktop-team will select apps to drop off
6. Selected apps will then available for review, comments, feedback

Comments:
* gnucash
** I would suggest "homebank" instead, it is much, much easier to grasp IMHO. It doesn't require a budget-style balance workflow like accountants are used to. --Jeff
*** Agreed -- <nowiki>[[Qense|qense]]</nowiki>
* gftp
** I'd suggest FileZilla instead, it looks better and is more modern. -- <nowiki>[[Qense|qense]]</nowiki>
* Boxee Beta is a media center, and it is packaged, unlike XMBC. -Wiggums
** Boxee is not in the Ubuntu archives, thus is not installable from the Software Centre -- RobertAncell
* Parcellite is might break copy/paste in applications like OpenOffice. Installing it is very dangerous for non-experimented users as they are very unlikely to understand why things are broken. The idea of a "clipboard manager" is, IMHO, too complex. It should be invisible. I strongly recommand to *not* feature it. -- LionelDricot
* 3D requirements... -- Arand
** chromium-bsu seems to run extremely sluggish when 3D acceleration is not available (simple noveau vs nvidia test), if we want a simple 2D game this might not be the best choice 
** fretsonfire is virtually unplayable without 3D support 
** stellarium is virtually unusable without 3D support
** moovida is virtually unusable without 3D support

* epiphany-webkit (light weight web browser?) DUPE of Firefox
