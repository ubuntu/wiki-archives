=== Our Mission ===

Since the inception of Xgl and Compiz there has been a whole lot of buzz in the community, and a never ending avalanch of howto's. third party packages, and of course countless bugs.  We seek to bring Compiz, and soon Beryl, to the ubuntu desktop, to make it easy to install, and painless to run.  We will be a regular Ubuntu team with meetings, with a mailing list, with bugs, with our own IRC channel, and direct interaction with Beryl developers.

=== Goals ===

Our list of goals include:
* Find and triage bugs in composite managers
* Maintain complete documentation of setup and usage of Compiz/Beryl
* Help new users set up their own systems, this is not just a developers toy anymore
* Bring new developers to the Beryl project
