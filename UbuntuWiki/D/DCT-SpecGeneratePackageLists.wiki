__TOC__

== Summary ==
Generate the list of source packages to monitor.
* From a list of maintainer emails (grep-dctrl on sources)
* From a list of additional packages

== Implementation ==
Should be a simple script to write using MultiDistroTools and some bash. Someone just have to do it and figure out a way to update the lists easily.
