__TOC__

This page describes the requirements for uploading to PPAs, or
rather to multiple distributions at once. It is a work in progress.

autoppa is prior art that should be looked at for inspiration.

=== Requirements ===

** Alter the version number for each distribution so that they
    don't clash and there can be an upgrade path.
** Upload the source to launchpad.
** Be able to tweak for older distributions that e.g. don't have a new enough debhelper.

=== Current steps ===

** Change the version number, usually using tildes, the release name, and some other string, often "ppa".
** Change the distribution target.
    - These steps can either modify the last changelog stanza, or create a new one.
** Perhaps tweak the packaging for older releases.
** Build the source package.
** Upload the source package to the PPA.
