=== About Me ===

I am new to the Ubuntu Bug Squad. And would like to start helping in cleaning up the bugs for the network part of the Operating System.

I have been an avid computer user since the days of the 286 and have had several computers since then. Either bought or built my own. Have been using Ubuntu since 6.04 . Had some experience in networking and in debugging procedures, and would like to help in anyway that I can.

=== Contributions ===

I really have not contributed as much as I would like to technical or otherwise. 

=== Future Goals ===

To be part of the Bug Squad and help in the development of Ubuntu and future projects to come. I can triage at anytime during the day.
