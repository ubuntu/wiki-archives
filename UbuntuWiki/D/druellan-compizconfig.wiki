== Compiz Config ==
My own tweaked compiz config.
Download: <nowiki>[[attachment:psy.profile]]</nowiki>

=== Goal ===
To improve the base config to be fun but usable on a day to day basis.

=== Notes / Guidelines ===
* Animations should be quick, ~1 second from start to finish.
* Weird animations should serve a porpuse, example: tooltips should zoom out from the UI element to show relation.
* Close animations should be *almost* always a fadeout, I don't want my attention to be dragged to something that is no more.
* I need a way to customize Unity animations :(
** "Pulse" is not quick enough for click feedback.
** "Wiggle" is too fast, too short and not showy enough to take my attention.
