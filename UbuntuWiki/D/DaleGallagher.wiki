__TOC__

I run my own business, http://www.zootzone.com and have 9 years of GNU/Linux experience. I'm primarily a Slackware user, but have used Red Hat, SuSE, Debian, Slax, Ubuntu and recently Rubix, which has a lot of potential. Recently, I have recommended Ubuntu to non-technical users moving from other platforms, hence my peripheral involvement with occasional bug reports, mailing list messages and IRC chats. I'm partiularly interested in Xubuntu, as I'm an avid fan of the Xfce desktop environment.

I believe that GNU/Linux distributions need to focus on making trivial, repeated tasks like basic network connectivity, communications, and package management an easy task. Ubuntu appears to be following this goal. I have realised that the fragmentation in the OSS world is a two-edged sword, bringing about amazing innovation, but also cramping collaboration across projects, particularly when it comes to "doing the right thing" both technically and from an end-user's perspective.

Computing has come a long way, but many entrenched systems (like Sysvinit) are out-dated and unwieldy. There are many fantastic and better alternatives to many of these entrenched systems which are unfortunately overlooked due to dogma and standards like LSB.
