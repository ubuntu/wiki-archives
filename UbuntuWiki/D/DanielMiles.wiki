__TOC__

I'm a reasonably long time Ubuntu user just beginning to get into really giving back to the community. 

I'm learning how to do some basic bug triaging, and trying to report more things that I notice as imperfect.

My focus is learning how to package properly, as debian packaging seems to be the most useful and interesting thing I can think of without having to actually learn how to code...
