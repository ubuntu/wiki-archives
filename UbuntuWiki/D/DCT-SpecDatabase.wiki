__TOC__

== Summary ==
Way to manage ''reviews'' of packages and meta-bugtracking : tracking of bugs filed in Debian.

== Use cases ==
* DCT member A has some free time, and wants to find a package to review. He needs a way to know which packages need his help. What's the version in Debian, in Ubuntu ? When were they last reviewed ?
* DCT member A now needs to read the ''history'' of this package's reviews. Who reviewed it in the past ? What were the conclusions about this ? Which Debian bugs were filed ? Are they still open ?

== TODO ==
* detailed spec
* implementation
