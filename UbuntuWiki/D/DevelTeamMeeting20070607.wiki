==== Ian Jackson (iwj) ====

Done:
* Discussed with Scott, and wrote a new disk full testing spec. (FullFilesystemSanityGutsy).  Scott yet to approve but I've already started on trying to find where in libc to hack it.  (Ideally I want to hack libc so I can catch in one place every syscall that returns ENOSPC.)
* Various ongoing discussionlets about winmodem support, particulary in the context of Dell.  The situation really needs improvement.
* Got mvo to introduce me to Carlos Garnacho so we could get him to fix the default dialling type (apropos of winmodem support, but should be fixed generally).  I also fixed the seeds to put sl-modem-daemon on the CD.
* Updated the consistent-login-screen spec to prefer the VC switching approach at least at first.  This is as unpopular as I expected and I predict that the end result will be a decision to turn off fast user switching.
* Merged dpkg from svn to get the latest lpia changes.
* Various other loose ends I've forgotten.
