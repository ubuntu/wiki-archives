Done
* Teardown: implemented as specified, there will be ongoing work to remove shutdown scripts from packages not installed by default.
* LibAtaForAtaDisks: implemented /etc/fstab migration (in volumeid); implemented resume-from-uuid which we forgot in the spec; grub root= migration.
  - Needs someone else to do other bootloaders (who knows them, and can test better).
  - Needs someone who knows them to investigate "special filesystems" (LVM, EVMS, RAID, devmapper, etc.).
  - Probably also needs mount to be patched to use libvolume_id instead of libblkid so it can support uuids from more filesystems.
* ReplacementInit: making progress; debating when is the right time to add this to the archive, as it will not be fit to completely replace /sbin/init for a few weeks yet -- but then maybe this is a development release, so people shouldn't need their machine to boot normally, etc.

To do
* Spending the week mostly on ReplacementInit and BootMessageLogging
