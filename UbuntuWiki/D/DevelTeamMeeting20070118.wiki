Done
* Documentation correction on new printer driver package SpliX (Samsung laser printers)

* Updated foo2zjs printer driver package: Now there is also support for the HP LaserJet M1005 MFP, Konica Minolta magicolor 2490MF and 2530 DL
* Updated foomatic-db: Marked more drivers obsolete, removed Foomatic data which already comes with driver packages, so less occurences of the problem described in bug #59324
* Updated gs-esp: Replace static binary by one using the libgs-esp library, saving 4.7 MB on installed system, package splitting to allow installation on X-less server
* Answered to bug reports

To do
* Prepare Ubuntu for new FHS standard for printer driver and PPD file directories, to prepare for installation of distribution-independent driver packages (LSB 3.2). See http://lists.freestandards.org/pipermail/printing-architecture/2006/001512.html
