Hello this is the wikipage of DieB.

I started using Ubuntu with the 5.10 release in March of 2005. Due to some malware hassle with the crappy xp (it seemed  I lost 25 GB of Music - what was quite alot that time - but ubuntu brought it all back !!). So we got married ;)

In the beginning me had been more in the <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/|UbuntuForums]]</nowiki> as dbasis or DieB. But after a while I got distracted by some other things.
 
On launchpad you can find me at launchpad.net/~dieb

In the last two years I mostly advocated ubuntu to friends and worked on an customized ubuntu live-cd, to get more involved in using Linux/Ubuntu than thinking it is not useable.

==== My goals for/with ubuntu are: ====

* get the number 1 on pcs and laptops and netbooks and what so ever
* extend the user-expierence
* give users the possibility to easily learn about the underlying system
* build a strong community to survive the next crisis (so it can go on even without canonical)

==== My Contacts are ====
