'''TODO: This page should provide info for common users how to report Java related problems and bugs properly.'''

== Introduction ==

Bugs relating to <package name/category> typically fall into X categories:
# User interface bugs - require a detailed description of the issue, steps to reproduce and screen captures where appropriate. 
# Crasher bugs - Log files from the crash incident are required to track down these.
# Hardware specific bugs - The developers may not have access to the hardware that triggers this bug. Certain log files and command outputs can help
# Package selection - Help to find the right package (may be specific to category -- a bug filed as ubiquity may in fact be a casper d-i bug, an xorg bug may be an xorg-driver bug, etc.)

== How to file ==

Useful for bug-filers and as a boiler-plate advice for triagers.  This is the minimum information required for a bug report.

== Bug tags ==

Bug tags specific to the package or area should be included here for reporters so they can tag their bug report.  It will also be useful for triagers.  The Bugs/Tags wiki page should then be modified to include these tags.

== Debugging procedure ==

In depth debugging procedures for this particular package or subsystem.  This usually is information about the log files to gather and what to look for in them.

== How to Triage ==

Information that will facilitate the triaging of bugs for this package or subsystem.  Remind triagers of the bug tags in use for this particular package.

=== Stock Reply ===

A stock reply to be used for initial bug reports basically asking for the stuff in "How to file".  The Bugs/Responses page should include this reply.

=== How to Forward ===

In the event that the package or subsystem has an upstream bug tracker this section should contain detailed steps to forward a bug to that tracker.  Some packages may just link to the general "How to Forward" page for another bug tracker like Gnome's bugzilla or freedesktop.org's bug tracker.

== Known bugs ==

Description of known bug reports that may receive duplicates and how to recognise them.  This information should be obtained by looking for bugs tagged as 'metabug'.
