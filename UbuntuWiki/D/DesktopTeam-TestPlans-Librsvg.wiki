__TOC__

For Librsvg we test that its reverse dependencies SVG capabilities are still fine.

This is our test SVG:
<pre>
<svg width="250" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
  xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
  <svg x="10">
    <rect x="10" y="10" height="100" width="100"
        style="stroke:#ff0000; fill: #0000ff"/>
  </svg>
  <svg x="120">
    <rect x="10" y="10" height="100" width="100"
        style="stroke:#009900; fill: #00cc00"/>
  </svg>
</svg>
</pre>

It displays two non-overlapping squares side by side.

==== Xboard ====

The figures in the chess board are SVGs, so resize the window some times and verify that the figures are resized and displayed fine (see <nowiki>[[attachment:xboard.png]]</nowiki> for reference).

{i} Exercised code base: <nowiki>[[https://sources.debian.org/src/xboard/4.9.1-2/draw.c/#L324|draw.c]]</nowiki>

==== Eye of Gnome ====

Load the test SVG in it, verify that the picture displays correctly too when changing zoom level and rotating it.

==== Gthumb ====

Load the test SVG in it, click the brush button to edit it and verify that the picture still displays correctly changing zoom level and rotating it.

Crop the image and verify that it is still displayed correctly.

==== Inkscape ====

Load the test SVG in it and click the ellipsis button. Add a yellow ellipsis (shortcut: E) somewhere in the picture. Save as <code>square-ellipsis.svg</code>. Inspecing the file in a text editor should reveal an 'ellipse' element. Firefox should display the same picture you see in inkscape.
