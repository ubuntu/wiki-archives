Hello!

I am Daniel Voicu, currently working as a Web Copywriter for a Romanian interactive agency. I am playing around with Linux distributions since 2000 (although I took some breaks from time to time) but now I'm rollin' with Ubuntu. You can find out more about what I did and what I'm doing at this moment in the next few lines.

== Past activities ==

Linux Editor at Softpedia

I was Co-Editor and Community Admin at Open Source Living. I also helped out with the usability issues and with the project management.
