quick brain dump on how to do upstream work on kde networkmanager applet.

==== finding your way around ====
knetworkmanager pieces are split into parts in kdebase/workspace/solid and the plasma-widget playground tree. see "building and running" below how to get those trees.

==== building and running ====

1. Get the following branches:
** svn://anonsvn.kde.org/home/kde/trunk/playground/base/plasma/applets/networkmanager
** svn://anonsvn.kde.org/home/kde/branches/KDE/4.3/kdebase
1. create build/ directory in both: <pre>
mkdir networkmanager/build; kdebase/build </pre>
1. install build-depends of plasma-widget-network-manager (or knetworkmanager or whatever) <pre>
sudo apt-get build-dep plasma-widget-network-manager
</pre>
** also ensure that you have kdebase-workspace-bin installed (which is installed if you run kubuntu, but maybe not if you are on gnome)
1. in the build directories run cmake like: <pre>
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/your/prefix ..
</pre> you can use /usr as prefix, but that will clutter your install; asac used /home/asac/local_knetnm; remember to add whatever dir you use to KDEDIRS environment
1. to build networkmanager main pieces go to networkmanager/ dir and run: <pre>
make install
</pre>
1. the networkmanager pieces in kdebase are in <code> kdebase/workspace/solid/networkmanager-0.7 </code> and <code> kdebase/workspace/libs/solid/ </code>; so if you changed something in there, cd into the matching build/ dir and run <pre>
make install
</pre> too.
1. remember to update the service cache with your KDEDIRS properly set to ensure that you are really using your bits installed outside of /usr <pre>
kbuildsycoca4 --noincremental
</pre>; asac's KDEDIRS were set like this: <pre>
echo $KDEDIRS 
/home/asac/local_knetnm/:/usr/
</pre>
1. start knetworkmanager like: <pre>
./monolithic/knetworkmanager --nofork
</pre>
