== Lessons Learned ==
Over the next several weeks I would like to make contact by phone (the bandwidth of IRC and Email is just too low) with the creators and maintainers of existing distributions based on Ubuntu.

I would like to ask questions about what you have learned putting out your distribution and how Ubuntu can make it easier and more efficient create and maintain your distribution.

I will then run your question by some of the Ubuntu developers and started turning them into feature specifications.
