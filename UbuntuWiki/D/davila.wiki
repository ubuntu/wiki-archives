'''About me'''
----
I become a linux user since 1999. I'm using Ubuntu from the 5.10 release.

''' My actual activities related to Ubuntu '''
----
My activities related to Ubuntu are, for now, some translations to Spanish. You can see this link:

https://translations.launchpad.net/~davila

and some notes in my blog ( http://blog.nicaraguaopensource.com/ ) published when I faced some situation related to Ubuntu ( like a server installation) or another issue related to the Linux world.

''' Some talks '''
----
For some activities in my country related to the free software I like to participate talking about netfilter/iptables, webserver configurations, how to share the Internet connection via proxy with Squid and some other topics.

My last participation was about the administrative menu in GNOME (for Ubuntu 9.04).
