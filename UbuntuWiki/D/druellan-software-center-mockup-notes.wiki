* Three column layout looks nice on landscape, but on a vertical space (tablets, phones) could be some complications.
* I find it strange that the author is not mentioned anywhere. My understanding is that authors are very proud of their work and will like to see their names. Also, commercial companies will welcome the publicity, or even better, a way to have their own list of games on the store.
* The way the requirements are shown on both the technical details, notifications and button text seems odd. I need to think a bit about that...
* I'm pretty sure border to border (inset) areas will work better than floating boxes, but I'm not sure about UI's toolbox limitations on this matter.
* Text sizes and line-heights need to be explored further.
* Left and right columns are about 190px, fixed. Central column is dynamic.
