Some discussion about whether the X bugs are truly Release Critical, and whether there are other bugs that aren't labeled as such, but should be. 
For example bug 356264 is widely reported, but not targeted.
ACTION: rickspencer3 to get list of critical bugs from bryce, follow up with release team to get correct bugs tracked.

** fix LP: #354420 - offline notification should have NOTIFY_URGENCY_CRITICAL;
** eliminate most string changes from a few notification patches to ease translation task for dxteam
** make 0.7.1 release fit: ensure that it also builds on hardy; backporting
    policykit function from 0.8; ensure that this happens upstream too.
* Firefox/Mozilla:
** discuss with community and investigate regression LP: #353924; thinking
    about solutions better than "just" backing out the fix that triggered this.

==== Arne Goetje (ArneGoetje) ====

* moving and renaming translation templates in Rosetta
* meeting with Kevin Huang and Zheng-Peng Hou to discuss Chinese font development for Karmic.
* uploading new Mozilla translations (3.0.8) into Rosetta for Hardy, Intrepid and Jaunty
* debugging and fixing Albanian (sq) and Galician (gl) translations for Mozilla, reporting bugs upstream and uploaded the fixes into Rosetta for Hardy, Intrepid and Jaunty. Before those languages where not importable into Rosetta, due to format bugs in the translations and tarballs.
* testing Jaunty installation media on my laptop

==== Bryce Harrington (bryce) ====
===== Distro =====
* Sponsoring - xserver-xorg-input-aiptek(#352083), xorg-server(#353074),
   xserver-xorg-video-ati(#351245), libdrm(#350925),
   nvidia-graphics-drivers-180(#348852), screen-resolution-extra(#282283),
   xfree86-driver-synaptics(#320632), xorg-server(#356254)

===== Xorg Work =====
* General X bug triage
* Investigate spate of -intel 8xx bugs.  Fix #322646 for i855 and
## 317457 for i865, and so now #304871 (for i845) can finally be
   closed.  Workaround #279835 by disabling DRI on i810.
* Attempting to contact Intel regarding stability issues with current
   -intel driver
* Created a glossary of cryptic terms that show up commonly in X error
   messages.
* X Hug Day April 2nd netted some triaging
* Helped cwillu get up to speed; he's volunteered to help focus on
   -intel bug triage on an ongoing basis.
* Sponsored several contributed X patches (#348052, #328205, #134906,
## 337926, #356254)
* Heavy focus on -intel bugs.
   - Fix user switching freeze, caused by an earlier patch (#348428)
   - Workaround X freeze on i865 (#317457)
   - Fix BO backbuffer bug on i855 (#322646)
   - Fix lid close freeze on Thinkpad X30 (#304614)
   - Fix 4 crasher bugs with Xv video playback (#354688, #352760,
### 354889, #347527)
* Analyzed 356264.  VirtualBox shipped a non-1.6.0-compliant video
   driver that causes xserver to crash, resulting in dozens of dupe
   bugs.  Cleaned it up, identified workaround/solution.
* Browsed through other SIGSEGV crasher bugs in xorg-server and cleaned.

==== Martin Pitt (pitti) ====
Assigned blueprints: all implemented

Currently open stable/milestoned bugs:
* Bug:264336 (pgsql fails to start due to shared buffer setting greater than kernel allows): hard to reproduce, started discussion upstream; looks like wontfix for jaunty
* Bug:344688 (New PostgreSQL bug fix microreleases: 8.3.7, 8.1.17): in -proposed

Non-chores stuff done:
* finishing touches on the apport launchpadlib branch, and sorted out remaining ronne firewall issues with IS; switched ronne's appor retracers to launchpadlib after p-lp-bugs broke once again with the new Launchpad rollout
* above has uncovered a few bugs in launchpadlib; filed, and sufficiently worked around in apport
* fixed langpack-o-matic to support extra Recommends: packages on language-pack-*; quick hack for #352036 until we get a good long-term solution in Soyuz
* lots of debugging and bug fixing, primarily on my assigned RC bugs
* Spent a couple of hours debugging X.org -intel bugs with upstream and testing a few patches; unfortunately this did not yield something truly working yet

Sponsoring:
* gnome-system-tools, system-config-printer
==== Robert Ancell (robert_ancell) ====
* First week working from home.  General triaging and reading of existing bug reports in packages.
* Fixed Rhythmbox not being able to copy long similar filename tracks to iPods (bug #312902)
* Fixed low resolution rendering of small SVG images set to fill background (bug #9722)
* Fixed GDM configuration applet 24 hour option (bug #256283)

==== Sebastien Bacher (seb128) ====
* nautilus bug fixing: don't set the autorestart key to workaround
issue with gnome-session restarting in it loop when no background is
displayed for example, set no action for autorun since those are mostly
not working under linux
* backported some rhythmbox svn changes
* new poppler bug fix version
* triaged gvfs and nautilus issue, did some svn snapshot to give some
testing to all the bug fixes that landed there recently, updated to
2.26.1 tarballs rolled later
* new totem version
* updated gnome-settings-daemon to not use notifications when
multimedia keys are used, the player track changes are enough and those
were displayed when no player is running which is confusing

changes, decided to drop the change for jaunty since it creates some
issues, we will investigate on that next cycle
* lot of desktop bugs triage
* sponsoring: notify-osd gnome-panel tsclient brasero notify-osd pidgin
totem-pl-parser tracker gnome-nettool gtk2-engines-murrine gdm
gnome-keyring rhythmbox evolution-indicator tracker glade3

* Fixed Plug'n'Print in hal-cups-utils. It generated broken USB CUPS URIs (bug #348316)

* Fixed foomatic-rip to prioritize command line option settings against default option settings inserted into the filter command line by CUPS (bug #338999)
* Let system-config-printer not use setlocale() only to do locale-independent case-insensitive comparing (bug #340932)
* Made PPD updater of Gutenprint fail gracefully (bug #353220, bug #353242)
