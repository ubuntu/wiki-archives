=== The Problem ===

Currently, there's no easy way to install packages that have been downloaded from the web. The only way to install no-repository packages is dpkg -i with manual dependency resolution. This is not very userfriendly and does not encourage 3rd party development for Ubuntu.

=== The Solution ===

Michael Vogt has hacked together a prototype called Gdebi. The source is available via bazaar-ng (bzr) at http://people.ubuntu.com/~mvo/bzr/gdebi--main. Debs are available at http://people.ubuntu.com/~mvo/gdebi.

''My idea would be to inspect the deb file and extract the control
information and parse the Depends/PreDepends/Conflicts line. Now use
libapt to figure if these dependencies can be satified and if so,
install them. Then dpkg -i is called. This way it will never produce a
broken cache but still make install local debs easy and painless (with
information how many additonal packages needs to be installed). And no
need to modify apt/synaptic/sources.list.
