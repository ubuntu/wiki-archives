| evolution

| even if not shipped by default, might not hurt to have it 'supported' in main, has a few universe deps not listed here, was in default install until 2011. (Laney: We intentionally demoted it out of supported when it had obsolete deps. I don't personally see why we would take on maintaining another application if we're not using it, especially one that hasn't been trivial in the past.)

==== Notes ====
* Done means that is in main and in the default install
* 'In main before?' should link to the approved MIR unless it was in main before Ubuntu had MIRs. In that case, just use Y for that field.
* The Approved field allows us to easily see which MIRs have already been approved.
* The Other category is for stuff that's not a priority now or maybe doesn't need to be in the default install or main.
* The - in the first row is a basic form of nesting.
* See <nowiki>[[MainInclusionProcess]]</nowiki> for how to file MIR bugs.
