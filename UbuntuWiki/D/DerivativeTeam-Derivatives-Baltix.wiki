== Introduction ==

'''''Baltix GNU/Linux''''' is a GNU/Linux distribution, based on <nowiki>[[Debian]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[Ubuntu]]</nowiki> aimed to be a complete, user-friendly operating system for people, living in the Baltic region (mainly for Lithuanians and Latvians). Additional supported languages are  Russian, English, Polish, Estonian, Norwegian and others near and around the Baltic region. The main language is Lithuanian (at least for now).

Main desktop environment is <nowiki>[[GNOME]]</nowiki>, additionally little resource concuming desktop environment is included (currently LXDE, maybe will include Equinox Desktop Environment or Enlightentment - E17, from <nowiki>[[Elbuntu]]</nowiki> project).
Baltix GNU/Linux has pretty long history (older than Ubuntu, first public versions released in 2003), the very first versions were based on <nowiki>[[Knoppix]]</nowiki>, then Morphix framework was used and at last Ubuntu technology was choosen for LiveCD. Despite of changes in startup and installation technologies Baltix is always distributed as an installable <nowiki>[[Live CD]]</nowiki> with user-friendly graphical installer (0.8.x and 1.x versions additionally have text-mode debian-installer).

Currently (2006-2008) Baltix GNU/Linux is the best sold GNU/Linux distro in Lithuania (Baltix in Lithuanian shops appeared in 2003 with small book "Acquaintance with Linux", now people can buy cheap Baltix GNU/Linux CDs at many Lithuanian computer shops )

== Mission ==

Baltix GNU/Linux misstion is very similar to the Ubuntu mission, but is limited to the Baltic states:

 1. A majority of the PCs for sale in Baltic states should include  free (libre) software like <nowiki>[[Baltix]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[OpenOffice.org]]</nowiki> or <nowiki>[[Ubuntu]]</nowiki>.
 2. Popular Free software (e.g. <nowiki>[[OpenOffice.org]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[Ubuntu]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[Baltix]]</nowiki>, The <nowiki>[[GIMP]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[Mozilla]]</nowiki>/<nowiki>[[Firefox]]</nowiki>, etc) should be marketed in a way such that its amazing features and benefits would be apparent and known by all.
 3. Popular free software, including operating system, shall become so user friendly, that people will don't need any instructions or phone support to start use free software.
 4. Majority of local computer shops and bookstores should sell free operating systems, free software and books about this software.

* Posibility to run software, compiled for Windows OS
* Posibility to work comfortable on older computers (starting from 64 MB RAM and 200 mhz CPU), little resourses consuming desktop environment is included (currently LXDE)
* Comfortable for computer manufacturers (Baltix 0.8.x and 1.x) has a noninteractive automatic installation (autoinstall) feature - OS can be installed into computer in about 10 minutes without user intervention.
