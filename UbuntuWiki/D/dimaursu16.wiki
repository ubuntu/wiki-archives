Hello! My is '''Ursu Dumitru''', and I am from '''Republic of Moldova'''. I'm 19 years old, and I'm an first year student at '''Technical University of Moldova''', Computer Science. 

I am new to Ubuntu, and I'm enjoying it a lot. So I decided to help Ubuntu with development.

I also can help with documentation ( I know English(very good), French(middle level), Russian(good) and Romanian(this is my mother tongue) languages ).
