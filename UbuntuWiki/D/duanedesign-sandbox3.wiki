=== First Iteration of Beginners Team Graphics ===
The Structure Graphic I was able to spend more time on. It should give you an idea of what the Focus Group Graphic might look like when I get a chance to spend more time on it.

==== BT Structure ====
On this one i want to make another row on the bottom for 'Team Resources'. Show the IRC Channels relationship with IRC Focus Group and the same with the wiki and Documentation FG.

<nowiki>[[File:BT-Structure.gif]]</nowiki>

==== BT Focus Groups ====
I still need to make icons for the different areas of the community the FGs participate in. For example a bug icon for bug triage.
