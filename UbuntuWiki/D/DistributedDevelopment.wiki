__TOC__

This is an area of the wiki for the ''Ubuntu Distributed Development'' (UDD) initiative. This initiative aims to make Ubuntu development more efficient and bring it even closer to our upstreams by making better use of Bazaar and Launchpad.

'''Do you want the <nowiki>[[http://packaging.ubuntu.com/html/|Documentation?]]</nowiki>'''

=== Getting Started ===

You can read more about the effort on the '''<nowiki>[[DistributedDevelopment-About|About]]</nowiki>''' page.

If you want to know how to work with the tools and get things done then the '''<nowiki>[[http://packaging.ubuntu.com/html/|Documentation]]</nowiki>''' is for you.

For those that are interested in development of the idea you can read and contribute to the specifications. There is the '''<nowiki>[[DistributedDevelopment-Specification|Overall phased specification.]]</nowiki>''' Each phase then gets its own spec that will be a little more up to date when we work on that phase. '''<nowiki>[[DistributedDevelopment-ImporterSpecification|Phase 1]]</nowiki>''' is about importing Ubuntu packages in to Bazaar. '''<nowiki>[[DistributedDevelopment-DebianImportSpecification|Phase 2]]</nowiki>''' is about importing Debian as well as Ubuntu. '''<nowiki>[[DistributedDevelopment-ImproveDebianImportSpecification|Phase 3]]</nowiki>''' is about improving the Debian import by including the branches pointed to by Vcs-* information.

This is discussed on the '''<nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-distributed-devel|ubuntu-distributed-devel]]</nowiki>''' public mailing list. Please subscribe to that and join in the discussion. In addition please contribute any ideas you have to the '''<nowiki>[[DistributedDevelopment-IdeaPool|IdeaPool.]]</nowiki>''' If you want to know more about the technical details of what we have now then you can start at '''<nowiki>[[DistributedDevelopment-UnderTheHood|UnderTheHood.]]</nowiki>'''

If you have any comments or questions, or would like to get involved then please contact JamesWestby (james.westby@canonical.com or james_w on irc.ubuntu.com) or BarryWarsaw (barry@canonical.com or barry on irc).
