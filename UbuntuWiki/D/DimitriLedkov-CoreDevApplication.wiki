== Who I am ==
I am a recentish electronic engineering graduate. I started my
career as a software developer with free and open-source
projects. I worked for <nowiki>[[http://www.credativ.com | credativ]]</nowiki> (a
global Debian company) for 15 months as a consultant. I was
providing 3rd level support to sysadmins, doing
troubleshooting/profiling/sysadmin work and coding in python. In
May, I joined <nowiki>[[http://www.canonical.com | canonical]]</nowiki> to work in
FoundationsTeam.

== My Ubuntu story ==
I have started using Ubuntu during my university studies because
of: TeXLive, editors, EDA tools (PCB layout, VHDL, Verilog, etc),
compilers. Later I started fixing small things, maintaining a few
packages, eventually becoming a DD...

=== Areas of work ===

Broadly my interest lies in C, Python, Gtk+ stacks. I happened to poke C++ stuff as well. I am one of the leaders of the Debian Crosswire Packaging Team and I actively (somewhat) participate in the Debian python [apps/modules], science and games teams. I am involved in the OpenERP / openobject upstream & addons development. For a while I wanted to get into the lower stack. Thanks to my new job, I will be working on core operating system components, such as various file systems and the installers.

=== Things I could do better ===

English is not my native language, and inadvertently I make blatant errors, use awkward grammar and produce lost-in-translation innuendoes. These sometimes end up in commit messages and changelog entries.

== Plans for the future ==
=== General ===
* Make RAID/LUKS/LVM rock in ubuntu
* Make same rock in ubiquity
* Make a cunning plan to fix my English grammar

=== What I like least in Ubuntu ===
* the time it takes to dist-upgrade my machine
** Fix this with: btrfs? lvm-snapshots & disable fsync? debdiffs? magic pixie dust?

== Comments ==

=== Yolanda Robla ===
==== General feedback ====
I've been working on an OpenERP 6.1 package for Debian/Ubuntu. I'm not very experienced with packaging, so i needed extra help and an experienced point of view in order to finish the package properly. Dmitrijs has helped me a lot, explaining me about the proper way to use packaging tools, and proposing very useful suggestions. He has been always there to help, he has explained me how to do things, rather than just solving the problems himself, so that is a more useful contribution because he has passed me the knowledge for future work.
 
-- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:yolanda.robla]]</nowiki> 
=== Iain Lane ===

I merged some stuff into the transition tracker for Dmitrijs, and he followed up on some bugs which emerged. I'm glad to see more people using the right infrastructure for doing stuff.

-- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:laney]]</nowiki> 
=== Didier Roche ===

I sponsored some work that Dmitrijs did on the boost transition. All the transition were trivials (just a rebuild), but nicely done with the right process and tools. Also, the rebuild was effectively tested. This is not enough data for me to give a real endorsement, but knowing his DD and MOTU hat, I'm more than confident that Dmitrijs would do an awesome Core developer.

-- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:didrocks]]</nowiki> 
* Am not actually MOTU, only UCD. Thanks a lot though ;-) -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:dmitrij.ledkov]]</nowiki>

== Endorsements ==
''As a sponsor, just copy the template below, fill it out and add it to this section.''
=== SteveLangasek ===
==== General feedback ====
In the short time Dmitrijs has been with the Foundations team so far, I've sponsored uploads for him of sudo, lvm, grub2, and e2fsprogs, and am working now on sponsoring mdadm as well.  What in another might seem like audacity for tackling such a string of core packages back to back, in Dmitrijs is merely cool competence.  As often as not when commenting on his merge requests, it turns out that I'm wrong and he's right, which is just as it should be.

As Dmitrijs is already a Debian Developer, Ubuntu Member, and Ubuntu Universe Contributor, I have no concerns with his understanding of technical and social policies regarding the Ubuntu archive and fully endorse his application for core-dev.

=== ScottKitterman ===
==== General feedback ====
I've only sponsored one package for Dmitrijs, but it was a tricky one (split of boost1.49 into boost-mpi-source1.49).  I've also interacted with him regularly in both Debian and Ubuntu IRC channels.  He is clearly knowlegeable and pleasant to work with.  I appreciate the way he's stepped up on the boost transition (since I've done this in the past, I know what a pain it is).

==== Specific Experiences of working together ====
Discussion of boost transition and transition tracker requirements and sponsorship of boost-mpi-source1.49.  All very well done with no issues.
==== Areas of Improvement ====
None that I've noticed.

=== Evan Dandrea ===
==== General feedback ====

I've worked with Dmitrijs on several changes to ubiquity, usb-creator and migration-assistant. I have found his work to be of excellent quality. In discussions he's shown a clear understanding of the inner workings of our infrastructure and of Debian packaging.

I believe he has shown himself more than ready for core-dev status.

=== Kate Stewart ===
==== General feedback ====

I've interacted with Dmitrijs on Ubuntu IRC and found him knowledgeable on the key pieces of our infrastructure, and with a very good attitude towards doing the right thing and diving in to solve problems.  He's been doing SRU uploads as well as transition tracker work.   From our discussions, he has a sound understanding of the way our development and stable releases work, and wants to help improve the consistency and tracking, with debian and our releases.   +1 from me.
