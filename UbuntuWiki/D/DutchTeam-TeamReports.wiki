== DutchTeam Reporting Page ==

Our team reports are written in Dutch. We did translate those reports to English for a while, and you can find those translations in the remaining part of this page, but we're not doing that currently (i.e. July 2013). So for recent reports, please check out <nowiki>[[http://wiki.ubuntu-nl.org/community/Meetings/ListMaandelijkseVoortgang|the team reports page on our own (Dutch) wiki]]</nowiki>.

=== Older reports ===
