==== Mirco Müller (MacSlow) ====

Spec-related work (gdm-face-browser):
* trying to solve an "unsupported version 0 of Verneed record"-error from svn while updating gdm from subversion (probably from failing harddisk, see below)

* problems with enter/leave-events on actors to achieve "pulsating" on mouse-overs

* clutter_effect_*() turned out to be not flexible enough to allow looping timelines, had to move to full-blown setup of alpha/behaviour/timeline

* layout-algorithm not fully working yet, bounds of surrounding rectangle are sometimes exceeded

* drop-shadow rendering a bit too heavy, need to restrict it to using only two additional images

Misc:
* needed to replace failing harddisk in my desktop-machine, had to move much data between partitions, evolution- and browser-settings still not moved yet

* update of my laptop to linux-ubuntu-modules-2.6.24-16 caused it to be non-bootable, took some time to solve this

==== Sebastien Bacher (seb128) ====

* did some extra GNOME updates
* desktop bugs triage
* lot of bugs fixing and patches backporting for hardy
* sponsored some uploads
* upgraded some boxes from gutsy to hardy

* Final GPM packages
* Bugs, bugs and more bugs.  Nothing major so far.
* Continuing to work on Ubuntu.net whitepaper
* Off on Friday
* Helping with GNOME SoC, potential cool stuff for Intrepid
* Signed up for Ubuntu Open Week slot
* Started outlining Ubuntu Live talk
