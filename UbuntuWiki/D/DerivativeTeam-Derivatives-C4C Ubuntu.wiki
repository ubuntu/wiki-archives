==== Purpose ====

<nowiki>[[http://www.computers4christians.org/|Computers4Christians]]</nowiki> seeks to lead unbelievers to an authentic relationship with Jesus and to nurture believers in discipleship. To that end, C4C Ubuntu adds a wide array of Christian software and media to <nowiki>[[https://xubuntu.org/|Xubuntu]]</nowiki> utilizing the <nowiki>[[https://xfce.org/|Xfce]]</nowiki> Desktop Environment to create a light, fast, free, born again Christian Linux distribution.

==== Statement of Faith ====

We believe there is one true God, eternally existing in three persons; Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. We believe God created all things; including all life and the world we live in. We believe the <nowiki>[[http://www.savingus.org/bible.htm|Holy Bible]]</nowiki> is the Word of God and it is inherent and infallible. We believe Jesus Christ is the Son of God, our Savior and Lord. We believe Jesus was born from a virgin, lived a sinless life on the earth, died for our sins, and rose three days later. We believe in salvation by grace-through-faith in Jesus Christ.

==== C4C Ubuntu 22.04 ====

<nowiki>[[https://computers4christians.org/c4c/education/|Education]]</nowiki> Bible, Bible Desktop, Diatheke, Verse, Wide Margin and Xiphos are included to help the C4C user with Bible Study and works are preloaded and pre-indexed, so they are quickly searchable right-away. <nowiki>[[https://computers4christians.org/c4c/games/|Games]]</nowiki> 12 Apostles Quiz and Memory Game, Bible Knowledge Games, Bible Verse Maze Quest Games, Fun Bible Stuff and Flash Bible Games. <nowiki>[[https://computers4christians.org/c4c/graphics/|Graphics]]</nowiki> GIMP, Draw, Pinta and GNOME Screenshot. <nowiki>[[https://computers4christians.org/c4c/internet/|Internet]]</nowiki> File Zilla, Firefox, Gufw, Thunderbird and Transmission. <nowiki>[[https://computers4christians.org/c4c/media/|Media]]</nowiki> Audio Bible, Christian Video Shorts (45), Believe PDFs (5), Disciple PDFs (5) and The Practical Christian Life PDF. <nowiki>[[https://computers4christians.org/c4c/office/|Office]]</nowiki> Atril, Gnu Cash and Libre Office (Base, Calc, Draw, Impress and Writer). <nowiki>[[https://computers4christians.org/c4c/sound-and-video/|Sound and Video]]</nowiki> ALSA, Pulse Audio Volume Control, Gnash and VLC. 150 different photographs of God's creation comprise our collection of backdrops in HD, Standard and Widescreen aspect ratios. We also feature launchers to over 35 online Christian video channels, Christian video collections and Christian music video collections.

<nowiki>[[https://www.gnu.org/software/gnash/|Gnash]]</nowiki> is born again as a snap! Special thanks to <nowiki>[[https://raymii.org/s/blog/Ive_packaged_up_Gnash_as_a_Snap_for_modern_linux.html|Remy van Elst]]</nowiki> for making Gnash live again. Gnash is used to play over 150 Christian files in the SWF format included; 12 Apostles Quiz and Memory Game, 24 Christian video shorts, 24 items in Fun Bible Stuff and 117 Flash Bible Games! And there are no security issues – the Gnash snap is sandboxed – it only works on SWF files in Home and those files can’t reach the Internet.

To ensure fast start up and the ability to use Mozilla extensions, a non-snap version of <nowiki>[[https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/|Firefox]]</nowiki> comes with this Christian Ubuntu derivative. The included parental control extension <nowiki>[[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/foxfilter/|FoxFilter]]</nowiki> helps filter out inappropriate content on the web (subscribe if you find it useful) and <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Firefox|Firefox]]</nowiki> is packed with hundreds of hand-picked, nicely categorized bookmarks; from learning about Linux to learning about the Lord - it's in there.
