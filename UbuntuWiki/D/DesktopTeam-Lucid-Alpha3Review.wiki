== Desktop Team Work ==
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| '''Blueprint'''
| '''Status'''
| '''Notes'''
|-
| Firefox support model
| Postponed to Beta 2
| Backporting new glib calls to libsoup took 5 weeks rather than 5 days
|-
| Boot Experience
| Postponed to branding roll out
| tseliot still working on Plymouth theme. Animation support not accomplished by Dx yet.
|-
| Desktop start time
| Postponed to Beta 2
| Only .8 seconds or less to go on unity. Awesome progress.
|-
| Default Apps
| Postponed to Beta 2
| Seeds all changed. Need to determine pitivi readiness, and f-spot needs patching to support non-import editing
|-
| xorg triaging and diagnosis
| Done, some work items postponed
| some work on apport integration and bug queries was accomplished. Testing work postponed in favor of Wayland packaging and ChromeOS work
|-
| Bug management
| Done
| Lots of apport work, bughugger work, and query work accomplished
|-
| Jocky Hot Plugging
| Done
| You can now plug in a device and get jockey without running it or rebooting
|-
| Social from the Start
| Done
| Gwibber much improved along with integration of Me Menu and Gwibber API. Still some bug fixing and robustness to work on
|-
| Suspend quirks and xorg halsectomy
| Done
| There is no HAL at boot time in the desktop. HAL is now dbus activated if needed by an app
|-
| UNE Apps
| Done
| The apps in A3 will be the apps that come with UNE
|-
| UNE/Desktop sessions
| Done
| need more testing before beta 1 to make sure that the unity/UNE/and desktop sessions work properly across each other
|-
| xorg properietary drivers support
| Done
| Reduces system breakages by allowing proprietary drivers to maintain their own versions of libraries rather than sharing with open source drivers. This has the effect of keeping open source drivers always available as a fall back, as proprietary driver installation won't muck with the libraries and keep them from working
|-
| Compiz effects
| Done
| New settings are in. Roll back mechanism turns out to be not necessary, as "Nomral" mode is always just the defaults, it's not possible for users to tweak them, and the new defaults apply to all users.
|-
| Desktop in the cloud
| Postponed
| Server team creates images suitable for hosting in cloud daily. Instructions for accessing them were a bit convoluted, so actually using them is not trivial. Will consider addressing in Lucid + 1
|-
| Document scanning
| Done
| This was a bonus. robert_ancell created a sweet tool called Simple Scan. It is much loved and is now in Ubuntu. Debian has picked it up, but not clear what RH will do.
