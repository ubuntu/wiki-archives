==== About Me ====
----

I have been a Linux user since 1998.  I have tried almost every major Linux distribution out there and now I'm hooked on Ubuntu.  Ubuntu is a excellent distribution with a strong and growing community behind it.

==== Future Goals ====
----

I hope to become a valuable asset to the Ubuntu documentation team and a productive member of the community.  I believe that solid documentation is a vital key to any projects growth and is much too often neglected. I hope to assist in assuring Ubuntu documentation is the best of any Linux distribution.

Other goals:

* Maintain a few packages

* Have a little fun (that's the point after all)
