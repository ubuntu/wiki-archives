==== Current Status ====
Bryce reports two fundamental issues:
# Unpredictable freezes on i965 chips. He believes the freezes were introduced by the 7.3 to 7.4 Mesa upgrade. Unfortunately there are no repro steps for the freezes, so hard to verify that reverting to 7.3 would fix the problem. Bryce is exploring reverting to 7.3 in an SRU if the specific cause can not be determined and fixed.
# Poor performance on most intel hardware. Many people report that Jaunty is significantly slower. Many users find using uxa solves the perf issues, but introduces stability issues. Users also find the enabling the "greedy" MigrationHeuristic improves perf significantly. However, a path to turn on greedy by default re-introduces a segfault. Users who simply add the greedy option to their xorg.conf do not seem to run into this issue. Steps for enabling greedy can be seen here: https://launchpad.net/bugs/359600. 

bryce continues to work on these issues, and the desktop team is planning SRUs for fixes when they are discovered. rickspencer3 is also re-engaging with Intel to see if they can provide more guidance on solving these issues asap.

=== Gwibber ===
Gwibber is a universe project that kenvandine has been working on to get ready to use indicator-applet in Jaunty. Potential SRU if the changes are unobtrusive.

=== Translations ===
Final full export from Rosetta for the language-packs is currently running, expected to complete tomorrow. 

Jono joined to introduce David Planella (dpm), new to the community team. His role includes:
* to help grow and extend our extensive translations community
* to work with translations teams to help build best practice around great translations
* to work with upstreams to ensure we can participate as effectively as possible with translations
* to provide a resource inside Canonical to report to other teams the status of translations

=== UDS Topics ===
* https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UDSKarmic/Prep/Desktop
Everyone agreed to put their UDS topics on the wiki, and we will discuss in next week's team meeting.
ACTION: Everyone to put their UDS topics on the wiki

=== Release Bugs/Release Status ===

* X bugs discussed in -intel section above.
* bug 355814 - ArneGoetje believes to be fixed.
   ACTION: ArneGoetje to follow up with Riddell to ensure that 355814 is fixed
* bug 338982 is in universe, and is not a regression, so probably shouldn't be targeted.

==== Bryce Harrington (bryce) ====
===== Distro =====
* Sponsored:  screen-resolution-extra(version 0.8; fix FTBS).  No other
   sponsoring due to FinalFreeze
* Updated Jaunty Release Notes

===== Xorg =====
* Mega-triage Incomplete w/ Response bugs
* Xorg bug resolution w/ Intel
* Xorg Freeze bug (recent regression on i965)
   - Reviewed all reported EXA freezes for -intel
   - Wrote https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Troubleshooting/Freeze
   - Compiled https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Bugs/IntelDriver
   - Identified change as regression between Mar 30 to Apr 7th
   - Analyzed changes to relevant packages between these dates.
     mesa 7.3 -> 7.4 seems the most likely culprit
   - Performed testing to verify downgrading mesa resolves issue
     (not 100% sure... still got one freeze, but only after >24hrs)
* Confcall with AMD
* Xorg Performance bug (jaunty regression)
   - Analyzed greedy option, rolled package with old greedy patch
   - Analyzed segfault produced by above; not sure of cause yet
