=== About Me ===
Hi, my name is Dimitar and I'm working with ubuntu since Ubuntu 6.06 Dapper Drake. I really look forward to become a part of the MOTU team and start packaging some apps that are currently not in the ubuntu repositories. I'm also actively writing WIKI pages in the Ubuntu Community Documentation. And looking for minor bugs on launchpad to learn the way of a bug from reporting it to fixing it. I also have some articles and tutorials on Full Circle Magazine.

=== Working on ===
1.Now I'm writing a wiki page on rtorrent and I expect to finish it till 22 May 2011.
2. Finding how to join the ubuntuforums's Unanswered Posts Team.

=== Plans ===
1. I'm planning to form a Bulgarian LoCo Team.\
