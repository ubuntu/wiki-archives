| Ubuntu Theme Sounds, I was trying to get an air of distinction and maturity, so used a New York concert grand Steinway, quite a few cool synths, and underscored with violas, cellos and other orchestra sounds. With the long version of the Desktop Ready theme I was also inspired by idea of seeing sunlight spreading over the planet, as seen from space, realising we are all one life, and trying to do something that makes a positive impact all over the world (eg Ubuntu as a benevolent movement!). Hope you enjoy :)
