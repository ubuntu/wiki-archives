__TOC__

I am an office co-ordinator from Ontario, Canada. At work, I take care of a variety of task, including system documentation on some of our (admittedly simple) in-house applications. At home, I write and write and when I'm done that I write some more.

I've been using Ubuntu for about two years now, and am just now becoming literate in Linux concepts. From what I can tell, this is rather backwards, and I thank the Ubuntu team for that. Functionality flows from concepts, but you shouldn't have to learn them in order to access that functionality.

I like big words. It's a vice, really.
