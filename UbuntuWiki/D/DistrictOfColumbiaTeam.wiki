<nowiki>[[File:dc-loco.jpg]]</nowiki> Welcome fellow Ubuntites, Ubuntunistas, Ubunturists ("Ubunt-tourist"), etc! The DistrictOfColumbiaTeam <nowiki>[[LoCoTeams|LoCo]]</nowiki> covers the Washington, DC, metropolitan area (also includes parts of Maryland and Northern Virginia).  We focus on advocating the use of <nowiki>[[Edubuntu|Edubuntu]]</nowiki> in K-12 schools, local libraries, community centers, Section 8 (low-income) housing, and wherever else we can think of.  <nowiki>[[EdubuntuInstallations|Yorktown High School]]</nowiki> piloted and remains actively involved in the development of Edubuntu.  Other accomplishments include tabling for <nowiki>[[http://softwarefreedomday.org/|Software Freedom Day]]</nowiki> annually at the Takoma Park Folk Festival since 2005 and the Federal Office Systems Expo (FOSE). We have also installed Edubuntu for the <nowiki>[[EdubuntuInstallations|Tenants’ and Workers’ Support Committee]]</nowiki> and both the <nowiki>[[EdubuntuInstallations|Mount Rainier]]</nowiki> and the <nowiki>[[http://cityoftakomapark.org/library/|Takoma Park]]</nowiki> public libraries. Recently, members have participated in <nowiki>[[http://crisiscommons.org/|CrisisCamp Haiti, DC]]</nowiki>.

New members of the DistrictOfColumbiaTeam learn to use GnuPG so that they can digitally sign e-mail, files, etc.  In particular, using GPG is required to sign the Ubuntu <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntulinux.org/community/conduct/|Code of Conduct]]</nowiki>, which makes one a true <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership|Ubuntu member]]</nowiki>. In addition, you become part of the "web of trust". To learn about working with GPG, see the GnuPrivacyGuardHowto page.  See also "<nowiki>[[http://www.youdzone.com/signature.html|What is a digital signature?]]</nowiki>". This <nowiki>[[http://www.hlug.org/presentations/gpg/gpg.html|GPG tutorial]]</nowiki> also looks promising. (You can also contact KevinCole if you get stuck.)

== Local Commercial Support Resources ==

There are a few businesses in the area that are becoming quite interested in Ubuntu and its derivatives. Some are still learning Linux themselves but are willing to offer affordable support to non-profits and others with a limited budget.
