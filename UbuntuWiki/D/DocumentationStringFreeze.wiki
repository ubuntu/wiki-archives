__TOC__


The point at which we cease creating and modifying strings in Documentation. This freeze allows the documentation to be translated.

Exceptions may be made before release, on the following grounds:

* Major glaring typos
* Exceptional circumstances

A string change must be discussed (and approved) on the mailing list (see <nowiki>[[DocumentationTeam-Contact]]</nowiki>). If a string is changed after the freeze, it must be communicated to the translators (by writing to the ubuntu-translators mailing list) with enough time to update the translations before the translation freeze.

After release, any fixes must comply with the StableReleaseUpdates procedure (and are therefore acceptable in extremely limited circumstances, as prescribed by that page), and where necessary must be accompanied by translations before uploading.
