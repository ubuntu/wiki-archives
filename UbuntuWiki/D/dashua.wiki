__TOC__


I've been using Ubuntu as the primary OS since 6.10 Edgy Eft.  I was drawn to Ubuntu Linux after seeing screen cast of Compiz/Beryl which was ground breaking at the time and still unmatched.  I bounced back and forth between Windows and Ubuntu for almost a year where I then began distro hopping from openSuse, Sabayon, Arch Linux, and Gentoo.  I used Arch for about a year and then back to Ubuntu.
