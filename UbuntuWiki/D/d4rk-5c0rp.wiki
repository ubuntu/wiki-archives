=== About Me ===

My name is `ElAcheche` Bedis, aka d4rk 5c0rp. I am a Tunisian technology enthusiast who followed a Software Engineering degree.
I am a web and mobile developer.

The first time I have heard about the Tunisian community was in the UGJ 11.09 and I started following the community online and IRL since then.

==== Personal Linux Experience ====

I have first tried GNU/Linux in 2011 at UGJ 11.09, than it has become my primary operating system after two months.

As my knowledge about GNU, FLOSS and Linux have grown, I have tested many Linux distributions such as arch, mint and fedora<<BR>>
But currently, I am still loyal to Ubuntu as my main PC OS.

=== Contributions ===

Since I have joined Ubuntu-TN I had the chance to learn a lot from the community and especially about the community.
I first started helping the community creating some designs such stickers, covers, wallpapers and, posters
I also developed some ubuntu-touch projects as an ubuntu-tn developer and I am tring to give any kind of help as possible as I can to our community.

==== Events : Conferences, workshops, install parties and others ====

Most Ubuntu-TN events are listed on our <nowiki>[[TunisianTeam-Events|Events]]</nowiki> page. You can find events details, reports, photos and blog links on that page. Our <nowiki>[[TunisianTeam-TeamReports|monthly report]]</nowiki> may sometimes contain further details or information.

During these events I have worked with members of Ubuntu-TN community and sometimes with members of other FLOSS communities, organizations, universities and clubs. I am very thankful to everyone who contributed to these events in any way possible.

 {*} Bedis, aka The Artist, he is always ready to make a few mouse clicks and produce beautiful artworks. I can't imagine a Tunisian LoCo team event without a poster made by Beids and using only free software. His contribution to our community is important and I highly recommend his approval as an Ubuntu member.
