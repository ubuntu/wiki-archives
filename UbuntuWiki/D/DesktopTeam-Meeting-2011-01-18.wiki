__TOC__


== Weekly Summary ==
* The indicator stack was ported to GDBus, which caused some '''upgrade issues''' while packages were blocked waiting for everything to finish building.
* '''partitionmanager''' and '''muon''' got approved to be used on the Kubuntu CD.
* '''Reduced CD space by 25 MB''' by porting our GTK3/pygi apps to GTK2 and thus dropping GTK3, dropping unnecessary X.org fonts, imagemagick, and xulrunner-2.0. They now have enough space to even fit some languages.
* Tracked down and '''fixed plymouth corruption''', looks shiny again.
* More GNOME3 PPA updates (new GTK3, gnome-control-center, gnome-settings-daemon, eog, file-roller, accountsservice, gnome-power-manager)
* '''GNOME session saving is dropped''' as it caused a lot of issues. Email sent to the ubuntu-desktop ML: https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-desktop/2011-January/002734.html

=== Unity ===

* We've got an epic rally week!
** New compiz with an ABI break, making rebuilding all the compiz reverse dependencies. This made some upgrade issues. This version contains a lot of fixes.
** We also reviewed with the design team the compiz default settings and tweaked them a little bit. It's time to unity --reset to ensure you all have the default settings. Some can be noted: we now have a 2x2 ws layout by default (in compiz and metacity) as well as worskpace preview in the workspace switcher. Do not hesitate to report if those new settings are acting weirdly for you.
** '''New unity''' this week! A lot of fixes as we didn't have any release since mid-december (holidays…). A lot of new settings as well. We can hilight in particular the new launch background, autohide by default, super key to show the launcher, some refinement in the design for the quicklist and for the arrows in front of running application, automaximization of windows (if > 60% of the screen size), migrating all your settings from existing docks (awn, cairo-dock, docky) in addition to existing one (gnome-panel, unity mutter, netbook-launcher and your desktop).
** Changed the fallback system to support multiple fallbacks. If you install unity2d, the unity session will first try to fallback to it. If not present, it will fallback in the gnome classic desktop as usual.
* Next week: more to come!
** Maybe an initial dash implementation.
** Lot of bug fixes and a11y improvment.

=== Software Center ===
* Usability Improvements
** '''Startup time reduced a further 15%''' this week, branch awaiting review/merge
** Much improved install/remove feedback performance in listviews
* Ratings and Reviews
** R&R Server: alpha deployment is complete and we are currently testing against it
** Client-side development continues in branch lp:~mvo/software-center/reviews
** Gwibber integration completed
** Added link to wiki page providing guidelines for a good review
** Lots of testing, final tweaks and bugfixes
** Plan is to merge to trunk and release later this week/early next week
* Software Center version 3.1.10 released

=== X.org ===

* Tracked down a problem with the graphical GRUB menu being corrupt - some VESA bioses (like mine) have a broken preferred mode.  Colin Watson is looking at workarounds.
* New X server, drivers, and Mesa are coming soon!  Currently in xorg-edgers for pre-upload acceptance testing.
* Focusing a lot on compiz/nux/unity driver bugs.  Most known issues either fixed or narrowed down to something other than X.org so far.
* Discussing with NVIDIA and DX teams about improving backtraces when nvidia is loaded

(08:31:53) jasoncwarner: RAOF: TheMuso`: bryceh: robert_ancell, you ready for eastern edition meeting? 
(08:31:54) jasoncwarner: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DesktopTeam/Meeting/2011-01-18
(08:32:11) robert_ancell [~bob@ppp121-44-248-122.lns20.syd7.internode.on.net] entered the room.
(08:32:21) RAOF: Good morning :)
(08:32:22) TheMuso`: jasoncwarner: will be in a bit, just gotta reboot, brb.
(08:33:03) jasoncwarner: RAOF: good morning!
(08:33:37) jasoncwarner: TheMuso`: No worries, we'll be here when you get back :)
(08:34:19) jasoncwarner: Ok, lets get started. 
(08:34:38) jasoncwarner: [TOPIC] X.org
(08:34:47) jasoncwarner: RAOF: would you care to update X.org for us and bryceh can jump in if he is around? 
(08:34:53) RAOF: Yup.
(08:35:33) TheMuso`: back
(08:35:41) RAOF: Lookout!  It's about to be break-my-X season!  We're prepping Xserver 1.10RC1 and mesa 7.10 for natty.
(08:36:12) jasoncwarner: RAOF: thanks for the heads up ;)
(08:36:18) RAOF: 1.10 comes, as always, with a new input and video ABI, so installability issues may arise.
(08:36:43) RAOF: We'll send an email to ubuntu-devel-discuss a bit before uploading.
(08:37:24) aquarius left the room (quit: Read error: Connection reset by peer).
(08:38:01) RAOF: In other tangentially-X related news, we discovered at the sprint that some laptops have a broken VESA mode as the preferred mode, causing the shiny grub boot to be a corrupted framebuffer.  Colin's looking at how to work around that.
(08:38:40) RAOF: Xserver 1.10 should also fix some bugs that compiz/unity are running into.
(08:38:45) TheMuso`: VESA, the standard that should have bin... Or should I say the standard that was not.
(08:39:16) RAOF: VESA, the standard that nobody cares about because the last thing that really used it was dos 6.2 :)
(08:39:17) jasoncwarner: RAOF: any ETA on 1.10? How quickly are you thinking? Later this week? next?
(08:39:36) RAOF: Later this week is my plan.
(08:40:15) RAOF: If it comes down to Friday, it will instead be next Monday :
(08:40:16) RAOF: :)
(08:40:42) jasoncwarner: very cool, thanks
(08:40:42) robbiew [~RobbieWil@rrcs-71-42-177-86.sw.biz.rr.com] entered the room.
(08:40:52) RAOF: Mesa 7.10 shouldn't be long after that.
(08:41:41) jasoncwarner: ok, so it sounds like break-my-X-season is officially during LCA ;)
(08:41:53) jasoncwarner: Anything else for X? 
(08:42:09) RAOF: Nothing that springs to mind.
(08:42:31) jasoncwarner: ok...
(08:42:34) jasoncwarner: [TOPIC] AOB
(08:42:42) jasoncwarner: robert_ancell: TheMuso` Anything you wanted to add? 
(08:42:51) robert_ancell: nope
(08:43:52) jasoncwarner: Ok then

(08:43:57) jasoncwarner: http://people.canonical.com/~pitti/workitems/natty/canonical-desktop-team-natty-alpha-2.html
(08:44:10) jasoncwarner: we are a bit behind the trend line even with a great rally week
(08:44:20) jasoncwarner: don't forget to close out your WIs as you finish them
(08:44:49) jasoncwarner: there are some on other teams and we should be pushing those teams to clear their WIs as well.
