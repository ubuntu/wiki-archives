__TOC__

== Bugs ==
** do not display /dev/sdb and /dev/sdb1; instead, show human-readable description of device, and always consume the entire device when selecting "Wipe disk"
** Only offer the "smartest" choice.  If they don't have a partition table, then only 
** Show existing partitions if they are any
* Show lsusb abstracted name instead of device name
* Detect other filesystem quirks and force format (FAT16 or USB key that has no partition table i.e. partition direct on device - unless --whole-disk is used)
* keep existing files on the disk

== Done ==
* Make startup disk button needs to be greyed out when disk and iso are not selected
* when formatting block user interface and show progress bar. 

== Random Ideas ==
* automated tests?
** 13:23 <ev> xnox: on the automated tests front, do check out the usb gadget module in the kernel. It will let you write system tests without having to plug in a physical usb device.
* better message if you try to install something that's not an ubuntu iso
* NTFS disk support
* clone an existing usb stick (allowing for different sizes; might cause ui confusion)
