== Proposal for Alternative Structure of DesktopGuide ==

(<nowiki>[[mdke]]</nowiki>): this is my proposal for a revision of the current structure of the guide. My reason is basically this: I think that for such a big and comprehensive guide it is very important for everything to be easy to find (otherwise we will start feeling the need for shorter more targeted documents). The guide already does this to some extent, but I think we can make things clearer by:
 a. Having more top level headings
 a. Ensuring that each section is logically distinct

=== My proposed structure ===

Where I've renamed a section I've put the old name in brackets. I don't think there should be a separate "Tips & Tricks" section, but because I am not very familiar with the various things that are in there, I haven't attempted to integrate that with the body of the document.
