__TOC__

Below are the test cases that should be run when GDM is updated to new major releases in the development version of Ubuntu.

These should also be run for all GDM Stable Release Updates.

=== Test Case 1 ===

'''Login'''

# sudo apt install gnome-session
# Install the update.
# Log out.
# Select your name on the login screen.
# Click the gear button to choose a session to log in to.
# Finish logging in.
# Verify that things continue to work well for all these sessions:
** GNOME
** GNOME Classic
** Ubuntu
** Ubuntu on Xorg

=== Test Case 2 ===

'''User switch and user lock'''

# From a logged-in session, select the ''Switch user'' option
# You need to be able to login as another user
# You need to be able to unlock and go back to the the previous session

=== Test Case 3 ===

'''Smart card authentication'''

In absence of a physical smart card, this test can be performed by simulating one in software. Follow <nowiki>[[DesktopTeam-TestPlans-GDM-Smartcard|this guide]]</nowiki>.

# Configure setup with smart card authentication following <nowiki>[[https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-use-smart-card-authentication-in-ubuntu-desktop|this tutorial]]</nowiki>
# Ensure smart cart authentication works, plugging in the card both before and after gdm has been started
# Once logged in, unlocking the screen should work with smart card

=== Test Case 4 ===

'''Fingerprint authentication''' - ''If hardware supports it''

# Configure user to enable fingerprint authentication from user session (Settings -> Users -> Fingerprint)
# Ensure that after the user has been selected, it's possible to log-in with fingerprint
# Once logged in, unlocking the screen should work with smart card

=== Test Case 5.a ===

'''NVIDIA (Ubuntu 24.10 or newer)''' - ''For desktops or laptops with NVIDIA graphics''

This test verifies the default session type for NVIDIA systems running Ubuntu 24.10 or newer

# Boot to the login screen
# Select your name
# Click the cogwheel at the bottom-right of the screen
# Verify that all these options are listed:
** Ubuntu
** Ubuntu on Xorg
1. Verify that there does not exist:
** Ubuntu on Wayland

=== Test Case 5.b ===

'''NVIDIA (Ubuntu 24.04 or older)''' - ''For desktops or laptops with NVIDIA graphics''

This test verifies the default session type for NVIDIA systems running Ubuntu 24.04 or older

# Boot to the login screen
# Select your name
# Click the cogwheel at the bottom-right of the screen
# Verify that all these options are listed:
** Ubuntu
** Ubuntu on Wayland
1. Verify that there does not exist:
** Ubuntu on Xorg

=== What Could Go Wrong ===

GDM is the main login manager for Ubuntu desktop.

A severe enough bug could mean that people are unable to use their desktop version of Ubuntu or to log in to a specific session.

Smaller bugs could interrupt people's workflows.
