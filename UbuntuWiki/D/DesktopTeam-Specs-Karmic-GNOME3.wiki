=== Summary ===

The specification describes how Ubuntu will work on the new GNOME3 components, what packages will be available and where and what tasks the team plans to work on

=== Rationale ===

Ubuntu is a GNOME based distribution, having the new versions and components available early will benefit the distribution, users and GNOME

=== User stories ===

* Users will want to try the new GNOME components and be able to test GNOME3, it will be easy to do so from Ubuntu

=== Assumptions ===

* The new components will be available to universe first and until being ready to be used by default in which case they will be considered for the desktop installation

=== Design ===

* The new components will go to universe
* The current components updates will be packaged the usual way
* The team will work to make the desktop applications use the new libraries

=== Implementation ===

* gnome-shell will be packaged in universe
* zeitgeist will be packaged in universe
* http://www.gnome.org/~fpeters/299.html has the list of cleaning tasks, the team will work on cleaning api usage in the desktop applications and especially libgnome*, libgnomevfs, libglade, other libraries are probably too much work for the karmic cycle

==== UI Changes ====

* No interface changes out of the standard GNOME updates changes

==== Code Changes ====

==== Migration ====

* No migration required

=== Test/Demo Plan ===
