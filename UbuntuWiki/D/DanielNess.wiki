=== About Me ===

I'm 23 years old, currently living in Glasgow and working as a developer for a finance company. 

I have been exploring various distros since 2006, however, Ubuntu has had an almost constant presence on at least one of my machines. This persistence is largely due to Ubuntu's ease of use and supportive community.

In my spare time I enjoy running, mountain climbing, and have recently taken up parkour. I also spend alot of time tinkering with my home servers and working on various programming projects.
