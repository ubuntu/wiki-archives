Ubuntu welcomes you to Deview 2013!

You should receive a USB drive with a pre-installed Ubuntu Saucy image ready for use with VirtualBox.

=== How to use the VirtualBox image ===

1. Install VirtualBox. Please find the "VirtualBox" folder on the USB drive or download the installer for your platform from:

** Windows: http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/4.2.18/VirtualBox-4.2.18-88781-Win.exe
** Mac: http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/4.2.18/VirtualBox-4.2.18-88780-OSX.dmg
** Linux: install the "virtualbox" package with your package manager

2. Copy the "Ubuntu/Saucy.vdi" file to your hard drive, otherwise performance of the virtual machine over USB will not be good. This file is a virtual disk image of an Ubuntu installation. To use it, we need to create a virtual machine and "install" this hard drive in it.

3. If there are more people in the room than USB drives, please pass them along so that everyone can take part in the coding section of the workshop :)

4. Open VirtualBox, this is what you'll see:

Click "New" to create a new VM (Virtual Machine)

You'll enter the VM creation wizard. Give it a name, "Ubuntu Saucy" is good as Virtual Box then recognizes it as a linux-based operating system called Ubuntu automatically. Click 'Next'.

Now you need to specify how much of your laptop's memory the Virtual Machine can use. Please allocate at least 2GB of memory, 3GB or more is better. Click 'Next'.

Here you specify the "hard drive" for this virtual machine. Select "Use an existing virtual hard drive file", and click the small yellow folder icon at the bottom right of the window. A file navigator will pop up, use it to select the "Saucy.vdi" file you copied from the USB drive.

Click "Next" and the wizard will complete. Now you can start the virtual machine and boot Ubuntu!
