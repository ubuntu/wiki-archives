=== Mission ===

The Ubuntu Desktop Team <nowiki>[[DesktopTeam-Mission|Mission Statement]]</nowiki> is to produce a desktop environment that is:

* stable,
* usable,
* accessible,
* attractive,
* consistent,
* discoverable, and
* immediately useful.

To comply with our Mission Statement, the Desktop Team tasks are mainly to maintain and develop our <nowiki>[[https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/packagesets/plucky/ubuntu-desktop|desktop packages]]</nowiki>.

=== Maintenance ===

The first and most important task of the Desktop Team is maintaining our desktop packages.

We do this by:

* Keeping up to date with the <nowiki>[[http://people.canonical.com/~platform/desktop/versions.html|latest releases]]</nowiki> from our upstreams
* Triaging and fixing reported <nowiki>[[DesktopTeam-Bugs|bugs]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[Testing]]</nowiki> the desktop
* Deciding which packages should compose the desktop

=== Development ===

The second task is new development to improve the user experience, both by improving the usability of our existing desktop and developing innovative new interface concepts.

We do this by:

* Identifying key user <nowiki>[[DesktopTeam-Experiences|experiences]]</nowiki> that define the desktop
* Designing user cases for these experiences
* Writing new project <nowiki>[[DesktopTeam-Specs|specifications]]</nowiki> to improve them
* Developing some applications ourselves to fit the needs of the desktop

=== Contributing ===

Does this sound fun?  We have many suggestions on how to <nowiki>[[DesktopTeam-GettingStarted|get started]]</nowiki>, but here are a few important ones:

* Collect <nowiki>[[DesktopTeam-Visions|visions and ideas]]</nowiki>
* Identify <nowiki>[[DesktopTeam-UsabilityWishlist|usability issues]]</nowiki>
