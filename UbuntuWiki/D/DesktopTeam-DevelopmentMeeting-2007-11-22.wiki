=== Spec Approval ===

The list of specifications targeted as hardy feature goals were reviewed, and the statuses chased if they were not already ready for
approval.

ACTION: Riddell to complete drafting of kubuntu-hardy-kde4
ACTION: Riddell to mail Keybuk one-liners for all KDE parts of other specifications, and note who is going to do them.

ACTION: kwwii to complete drafting of art-team
ACTION: kwwii to complete hardy-theme and hardy-icon-theme after decision at London presentation

ACTION: MacSlow to add username-box-only (> 100) mock up to hardy-gdm
ACTION: MacSlow to complete drafting of hardy-desktop-effects

ACTION: mpt to complete drafting of exit-strategy

ACTION: mvo and Keybuk to discuss his specification list

ACTION: Keybuk to review all specifications

=== Use of usernames on GDM Face Browser ===

Kees Cook had raised a concern that displaying usernames in the GDM Face Browser would give intruders one half of the username/password pair, and thus increase the chance of intrusion.

Not displaying the names (and by inference, also not completing on them by typing) has usability concerns; while users may know their own photo, when using avatars or randomly selected imagery, they would not.

It was noted that the current mockups include the real names of users, not their username, however that it is often possible to deduce one from the other.

Also it was noted that the face browser inherently gives you one half of the pair since you don't need to know the username, you can simply click on the picture.

Imagery for comparison:
* {{http://people.ubuntu.com/~mmueller/face-browser-3.png}}
* {{http://www.guidebookgallery.org/pics/gui/startupshutdown/login/macosx103-1-1.png}}
* {{http://www.winsupersite.com/images/showcase/winxp_login.jpg}}

Consensus was that provided it was possible to disable the display of names, the default could remain with them displayed.  It is fine if disabling the display of the names is done by disabling the face browser (which needs an off option for the > 100 case anyway).

ACTION: MacSlow to update spec with result of discussion.

=== MoM and pending sync requests ===

Sometimes it take some time for a sync-from-debian request to get processed. The relevant package still appears in MoM even when the bug is filed and its possible that some work gets duplicated when people do not check the bugpage first and look at the open merge. Maybe we could teach MoM about requested syncs? Or get some limited archive-admin power to do syncs? The more patches we forward the more often we will want syncs instead of merges.

While it was noted that requests rarely take long, this feature would be trivial enough to implement.

ACTION: Keybuk to add check to MoM TODO

=== Patch Tagging Guidelines ===

seb128 reminded everyone that all patches should now be sent upstream, and appropriate tags added to the file as outlined in
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopment/PatchTaggingGuidelines

ACTION: all developers to review and obey

Developers should:
** submit patches upstream
** add tags for all new patches
** add tags when merging or updating a source package for any existing patches

seb128 also asked whether it was possible to have MoM show the debian/ubuntu-applied-patches, and whether it was possible to have an
HTML summary of those fed back and those to be fed back based on the tags

ACTION: seb128 to add examples to the patch tagging wiki
ACTION: Keybuk to add output to MoM TODO
