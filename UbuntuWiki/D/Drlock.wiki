=== About me ===
Among other things (see my <nowiki>[[http://www.drlock.com|website]]</nowiki> for the others), I am a Linux geek. I started with Red Hat way back in the day. When they changed their pricing/distrobution policy I went looking for a sane distro. I played with SuSe and DSL along the way and landed on Debian for a while. Debian had super package management but poor overall integration. Which of course lead me to Ubuntu. I am currently a huge Xubuntu fan. It has great package management good integration, superb community support, and small memory footprint. What more could you ask for?

=== Skill Set ===
* C/C++, Perl, PHP, Ruby, JavaScript, CSS/XHTML, Matlab, ...
* Linux hacker as needed
