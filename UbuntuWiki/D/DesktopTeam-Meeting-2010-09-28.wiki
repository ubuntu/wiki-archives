=== Actions from this meeting ===

=== Outstanding actions from last meeting ===

=== Partner Update ===
==== DX ====
* Another round of bug fix releases last week, I think they are in good shape for RC

==== UbuntuOne ====
* desktopcouch 0.6.9 was released today (in unapproved queue), should fix replication 

=== Kubuntu Update ===

=== UNE update ===

* Double dose of sweetness with 2 unity releases! and multiple uploads to some components :)
* More than 40 bugs were fixed last week, we gain support for a lot of things and no known crashers as of today!
* Of course, due to a crasher we needed to transition from libindicate0 to libindicate1 which we enjoyed a lot, but all went well after all. :-)
* RC is coming, iso testing is needed! thanks to everyone who wants to help there.
* I'm particularly interested from people who don't have graphical acceleration as the UNE session should not warn you about it, and once you validate, you should be logged out of the session and the desktop session should be set as a default.
* still some issues known with shotwell, should be fixed by eow
