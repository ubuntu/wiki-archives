''ACTION:'' Micah to send summary of PPU decoupling discuss to the DMB list ''ACTION:'' Micah to urgently send feedback on Bjorn's PPU application 

* PerPackageUploader Applications - Paul Gevers
** https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Elbrus/PerPackageUploaderApplication
** Was granted upload rights to:
     winff, daisy-player, ebook-speaker and cacti.

* MOTU Applications - Vibhav Pant
** https://wiki.ubuntu.com/VibhavPant/MOTUApplication
** Although Vibhav has demonstrated a lot of good work and technical knowledge, the board feels that Vibhav is a bit overenthusiastic and that he sometimes should stop and ask other developers before acting. As a result, we do not believe he's currently fit for MOTU and invite him to come back a bit later.
