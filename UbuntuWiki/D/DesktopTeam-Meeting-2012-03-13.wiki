__TOC__

== Weekly Summary ==

* Updated GNOME to 3.3.91.
* Start new oneiric-proposed language pack update/test cycle. (pitti)
* Fixed a few more a11y related issues in dbusmenu, menus should work fine now. (TheMuso)
* Found a weird bug where Orca won't speak indicator accessible descriptions, but successive restarts of orca and unity-panel service seem to resolve this somehow, I suspect a race, but am not sure where it is, since the accessible descriptions show up fine in accerciser. (TheMuso)
* Filed a bug upstream with the previously discussed ubiquity GTK accessibility issue, with the best solution to work around it in ubiquity for now, handed the bug back to ubiquity devs since I don't know the code. (TheMuso)

== Agenda ==

* ''Insert things to discuss at meeting here..''

=== Partner update ===
==== DX Systems ====
* Updates coming this week:  indicator-application, indicator-appmenu, ido, indicator-session, indicator-sound, indicator-power, indicator-datetime

=== Unity ===

* Finally release Unity 5.6 \o/ (with additional compiz sugar). More information on my blog: http://blog.didrocks.fr/post/New%2C-shiny%2C-Unity-5.6-released%21. We got today some more unity rebuild for an ABI break in libxfixes (and a small regression in alt + keys in some apps)
* Unity-2d with mutlimonitor support will be released this week (not a full release, just a minor one). Preparation is under way and FFe is here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/954175
* Speaking about multimonitor, we have now this FFe/UIFe, which is quite invasive (it's changes from the -3d MM support). Support in -3d landed in trunk, the 2d guys are waiting on the above FFe: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-translations/+bug/950136. The major UI changes (and giving some challenges) are in gnome-control-center. Speaking with design to see what can or can't be done.
* Continuing defining priorities and blockers: https://docs.google.com/a/canonical.com/document/d/1kiVPg0U7VJpHt21y-Qm9VtnLxsTmKHfBmA2B16yLGzc/edit and https://docs.google.com/a/canonical.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AuMtju1x8UoEdDNCT1U5MlVodjIwNGJPdnU5YVltVmc#gid=1
