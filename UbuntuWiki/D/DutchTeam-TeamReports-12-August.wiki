__TOC__

=== Administration Team ===
The wiki has been modified: logging in now requires Launchpad. This changes the usernames, requiring some adaptions to the ACL's and homepages. It is now almost completely done.

=== Foundation Support Ubuntu-NL ===
* An meeting in real life is being planned;
* New t-shirts have been ordered;
* The foundation is looking into branded mugs.
