=== Test plan for update-manager ===

1. If <code>apt list --upgradable</code> returns nothing, downgrade a package in the system.

(!) Of course it's better to do so with a cosmetic package that has no chance to impact the system, e.g. <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cowsay/+publishinghistory|cowsay]]</nowiki>.

2. Start update-manager.

3. Verify that update-manager suggests packages matching the output of <code>apt list --upgradable</code>.

{OK} If the list is too long, just scanning over the output is OK, as Apt will list package names and Update Manager their short descriptions and that makes a one-by-one comparison very slow.

4. Install one or more updates via Update Manager, verify that the corresponding packages are gone from

(./) <code>apt list --upgrade</code>; and

(./) update-manager's recalculated view.
