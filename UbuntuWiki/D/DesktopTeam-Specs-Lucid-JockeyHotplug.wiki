* '''Launchpad Entry''': UbuntuSpec:desktop-lucid-jockey-hotplug-support

=== Summary ===

Jockey supports printers, Wifi cards, and DVB-T cards, which often come with USB and are hotplugged. Instead of just triggering Jockey to check for drivers once after installation, we bring up Jockey when such a device is plugged in and needs firmware.

=== Release Note ===

The check for required hardware drivers ("Jockey") is now run when hotplugging hardware which needs firmware, such as DVB-T or Broadcom WLAN USB sticks.

=== Design ===

* When a device is plugged in which needs firmware, the kernel triggers a "firmware" subsystem uevent.
* Add code to `update-notifier` to watch for those uevents, check if the requested firmware file is missing, and if so, launch `jockey-gtk` (or `jockey-kde` in update-notifier-kde).
* Check modules which have jockey handlers (b43, wl, dvb-*) for having correct firmware file links in modinfo. E. g. `b43` has a wrong one, which needs to be fixed in the kernel.

=== Implementation ===

See blueprint work items.

=== Test/Demo Plan ===

# Ensure that you do not have firmware installed yet: no `/lib/firmware/b43/`, and the `linux-firmware-nonfree` package is not installed.
# Log into a GNOME or netbook session.
# Plug in an USB device which needs firmware, such as a DVB-T stick or a hotpluggable Broadcom Wifi device.
# After some seconds, Jockey should pop up, offering the firmware package/download.
# Regardless of whether you installed it or not, if you remove the device and plug it back in, Jockey should not pop up again.
