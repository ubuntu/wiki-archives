__TOC__

Daerot ("toread" backwards, pronounced like Cairo, with a "d") is a project made in light of Ubuntu Opportunistic Developer Week by Daniel Neel.

Purpose: Give users a simple, easy way to add books to a to-read list

Note: The project will begin allowing only a limit of 10 user-definable books, due to a lack of programming skills.

Roadmap:

v0.1:
    - users can input book title, author, year published, and view a list of inputted books - this list can be saved and opened again after made.
    - basic ui created

v0.2:
    - users can add new books to the list

v0.3:
    - users can sort the books listed by column

v0.4(?):
    - users can create a "reading schedule" sorted by various factors to get an idea of how long it would take to read their book list

v1.0:
    - program is in a feature-complete state

v2.x:
    - program pulls from an online book database to gather book information

Brainstorm:
    - Add desktop notifications to remind the users of things?
