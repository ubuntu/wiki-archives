=== About Me ===
I'm founder, and Editor, of Ubuntero.info (<nowiki>[[http://ubuntero.info|ubuntero.info]]</nowiki>), a blog for the Ubuntu Community, which is running in a bilingual mode (English and Spanish). The idea came after hours spent in front of my laptop learning and looking for solutions, finding ways to share the knowledge that I’ve been acquiring.

I am a technology junky ever since I can remember, I used to disassemble every electronic device that came in my way (I don't remember putting all the pieces back together), my first computer was a Commodore 64, that was when i fell in love with computers, My first encounter with Ubuntu was five years ago, it was my first Linux Operating System distribution, being spreading the word ever since.
