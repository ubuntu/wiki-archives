=== Outstanding actions from last meeting ===

* https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bugs/FindRightPackage: TheMuso to update the page for audio
** Not done, pushed to this week
* https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bugs/FindRightPackage: robert_ancell to update the page for compiz
** Not done, pushed to this week
* https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bugs/FindRightPackage: pitti to update the page for storage devices
** Done

=== Changed bug reporting process ===

Feedback about the `+filebug` redirection: 
* many bugs can legitimately be filed without apport information (such as translation bugs), wishlist bugs, or UI problems
* Devs still want an easily accessible "file it anyway" link 
* Proposal from Alex: Firefox protocol handler like apturl (`ubuntu-bug:file/firefox-3.5`), but that requires new code and will only work with Firefox
* Ideal solution: `+filebug` page shows wiki page contents and offers a "file it anyway" link at the bottom
* Compromise: Disable redirection for `~ubuntu-bug-control` members.

''ACTION:'' pitti to talk to bdmurray about +filebug feedback

Done in bug Bug:432088; other developers proposed the same solution.

=== Partner Update ===
==== UbuntuOne: ====
* Online services team is sprinting this week, and I haven't gotten an update from them yet
* couchdb
** split server from the rest of couch so it doesn't start at boot
* bindwood
** we need bug fix release with oauth enabled
* desktopcouch
** we need bug fix release with oauth enabled (to allow syncing)
* ubuntuone-client
** There will likely be a UI freeze exception requested to deal with the preferences dialog usability issue 

Martin pointed out that enabling oauth and peer-to-peer sync is a new feature which comes very late.

==== DX: ====

* <nowiki>[[DesktopExperienceTeam-KarmicWeeklyReleases|Weekly releases]]</nowiki>

===== Boot =====
* lots of incoming bugs about not being able to boot: https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/+bugs?field.tag=ubuntu-boot

** Video is broken and consistently crashing
** Ken will talk to cassidy (upstream)
** New telepathy-farsight was synced yesterday and is supposed to help a lot
* not interacting well with messaging menu

===== X =====
* Is there something keeping compiz from working on intel 945?
** Race condition on boot, sometimes does not load DRM modules and thus enable KMS and acceleration

See below

===== software-store =====
* looking good
* needs more testing?
* is it showing up in the right places?
** In Applications menu now, where it belongs
** Extra entry in System → Administration menu; filed as bug 435123 with a tested solution

=== Work items ===

Way above the trend line right now. Most problematic ones:

* Kubuntu/Todo/Karmic: 25 open items; Riddell says that many can be closed
* UbuntuSpec:desktop-karmic-firefox-3.5 : mostly cleanup left, which can be done post-beta
* A lot of the remaining items are QA/test plan/release notes items which are suitable for post-beta

ACTION: Riddell to clean up Kubuntu/Todo/Karmic

=== Activity reports ===

==== Alexander Sack (asac) ====

* finish autoconnect-inhibit (disconnect) network-manager feature and committed upstream
* lots of work on 0.8 network manager applet UI changes; prototyping various
   approaches and trying to get upstream to give a GO; still decision pending
* update gnome-bluetooth, webkit to latest upstream
* update finish epiphany to webkit migration; fix and upstream greasemonkey
   fixes for epiphany extensions; also fixed gw2get to work with latest ephy.
* work on networkmanager/modemmanager PUK issues; propose a solution with upstream; settled on doing it different (more work) LP: 
* ported galeon to xulrunner 1.9.1
* fixed listen package to not depend on xulrunner (just webkit)

==== Alberto Milone (tseliot) ====

* Bug triage for -ati, -intel, -fglrx. Upstreamed ATI bug #429251.Upstreamed Intel bugs #429241, #429191.

* Provided Felix Kuehling (AMD) with feedback about his patch for X which can't be included in Karmic.

* Reviewed and approved Mario Limonciello's patch to work around card detection problems in the -nv driver, uploaded his fix to my PPA for testing. The fix is now in Karmic (LP: #385658)

* Worked on -intel issue about suspend/resume with Compiz (#429241):
** Added a fix in mesa to correct the relocation delta for WM surfaces. Uploaded mesa to Karmic.
** Worked with Andy Whitcroft so that the problem is solved in the kernel too. The result is in: http://people.canonical.com/~apw/lp429241-karmic/ . The combination of the two (the latter will be uploaded after the freeze) solves the problem.

* Discussed critical bugs (affecting -intel) for Karmic with Intel engineers.

* [ATI R6xx and above] X fails to start up after mesa+git update (LP: #419126):
** After discussing the problem with Alex Deucher (AMD) I decided to disable the 3D driver for r600 in mesa.
** Experimental support for this driver will be provided in a PPA.

* Investigated problems with Intel Arrandal Video controller (#416792) together with Andy. I asked Intel about the error affecting tiling on the front buffer. Andy will integrate the new patches from Intel in Karmic.

* Filed bug report against ubuntu-release-notes so that my instructions on DontZap can be added (#432384).
 
* Synaptics driver: provided upstream with a small correction about the type of the Synaptics Area options in the man page of synaptics. This fix will enter Karmic too.
 
* Discussed #409456 with NVIDIA. I'm working on the changes as suggested by kees.
 
* Changed the section of the -modaliases packages (in fglrx and nvidia) to "admin" as the packages are not "restricted" (LP: #429153). Will upload it after the freeze.

==== Arne Goetje (ArneGoetje) ====
* langpack-o-matic:
** build new language packs for Karmic, Jaunty and Hardy
* language-selector:
** write a script to do the language-support completeness check independently from gnome-language-selector. This can be called by other applications to figure out which packages are still missing on the system for a given language code.
* Rosetta import queue cleaning

==== Bryce Harrington (bryce) ====

==== Chris Cheney (calc) ====

==== Luke Yelavich (TheMuso) ====

Accessibility:
* Continued debugging of speech-dispatcher pulseaudio output code. I have come to the conclusion that the pulseaudio output code
+needs tobe optimized a lot more, and more functions to help with better performance/latency need to be used from the pulse API.
+This shouldn't be too much work, if I can find some example code as a reference. Hope to land this by beta, if not ASAP afterwards.
* Uploaded new versions of orca, gok, and mousetweaks, all version 2.28.0 to karmic.

Audio:
* Audio bug triaging, bugs in question are against pulseaudio, alsa userspace, and the kernel for hardware enablement.
* Uploaded pulseaudio v0.9.18 plus a couple of extra fixes from the 0.9.18 stable branch to karmic, thanks to Daniel chen for his
+help.
* Updated libcanberra with some bug fixes from git head.
* Added files for libcanberra to play a login sound when gdm loads. This is still not working, so it needs to be debugged.

Misc:
* A little sponsoring, less than I should, I know. :)

==== Tony Espy (awe) ====

==== Till Kamppeter (tkamppeter) ====

* Uploaded system-config-printer: Integration of the new "dnssd" CUPS backend. It produced a lot of duplicate entries of the same printer and so cluttered the list of discovered printers a lot.
* Uploaded foomatic-db, foomatic-db-engine, ghostscript, hplip, gutenprint, splix, and all other printer driver packages to make the PPD auto-updates in the post-install scripts not ask for the server's password if the user has set a remote server via client.conf.
* Fixed CUPS bugs: Double-sided printing did not work on PostScript printers when the "sides" command line option for "lp"/"lpr" was used (LP: #411392), for options with an underscore (or any other allowed non-alphanumeric character) in their names the default settings were not conserved when the PPD got replaced ("lpadmin -p ... -m ...", system-config-printer, automatic PPD update for existing print queues, LP: #432902).
* Answered and triaged printing-related bug reports.
