=== About Me ===

Hello all, I'm David. I am a college student at the Indiana Institute of Technology getting my Bachelor of Science in Organizational Leadership. I have a real passion for community and would love to see the Ubuntu community grow.

==== Goals ====

My mission with Ubuntu is to encourage the idea of F/LOSS to everyone I can. This is done with talking with people at school and work along with working with LUGs and LoCos. Another way I am helping is trying to write tutorials that cater to the non technical user. Ubuntu is known for its ease of use and the ability to get some of the jobs done that most heavy users would normally deem simple may not be so simple to the new or non-technically minded users.  

=== Involvement ===

==== Kubuntu Council ====

I was a member of the Kubuntu Council for through two elections.

==== Kubuntu Documentation ====

As a contributer to Kubuntu Documentation I assisted in a leading way maintain Kubuntu Documentation. Talking with the volunteers to the project, reviewing documentation, filling documentation bugs in LP:kubuntu-docs and writing new documentation. I coordinated with the other volunteers to maintain and update the Kubuntu Docs. I have been working with Docbook and XML for over 10 years and continue to work to improve my writing and the documentation of Kubuntu.

Former member of the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-core-doc|Ubuntu Documentation Committers Team]]</nowiki> and am able to further help the documentation team in committing docs.

==== Kubuntu Testing ====

I have been working with all of the +1 releases, running bug reports, pushing the system to the limits so that we can improve the KDE experience of Kubuntu to support the user; along with this come the responsibility of ensuring that the user will not have problems from his system.  

==== California LoCo Team ====

Late 2010 I was honored by being able to help the CaliforniaTeam by being elected as one of the CaliforniaTeam tri-leadership. We are currently planning for SCaLE9x and have been doing Ubuntu Hours all over the state of California.

As a member of the CaliforniaTeam I attended Jam and release parties for Karmic, spoke at SCaLE8x and Camp KDE in San Diego, CA. Topics included documentation and KDE in Kubuntu. 

I also helped setup and run the Ubuntu booth at SCaLE8x. I also worked with the Gnome and KDE booths at SCaLE8x to have them hand out Ubuntu and Kubuntu CDs at their booths as well.

==== Ubuntu Beginners Team ====

As a prior member of the BeginnersTeam Council and I loved it. Learning and helping others further their knowledge in Ubuntu and Linux in general. 

We are in the process of moving the UBT toward a place where we can not only help new users but, also train the future developers for Ubuntu.

=== Testimonials ===

I have now known David for some time now and believe that he is quite the guy. He definitely knows his way around Linux/Ubuntu/Kubuntu and is always available for a kind word. When he's in the IRC, he makes himself available to everyone, whether they are an extreme user with a question, or a new user looking for guidance. In whatever he path he takes, he has my full support. -- <nowiki>[[zkriesse]]</nowiki>

David was a big help with testing and bug triage for the first Kubuntu Netbook release in Karmic.  I've seen what he's doing with Kubuntu Netbook documentation for Lucid and I'm fully supportive.  Lucid will be our first release for end users and his documentation work is an important part of getting ready for that.  He's been contributing steadily (I don't count time off due to a severe car accident and having to move for work against him) for some time now. I have full confidence in his work and intent to continue to contribute.  I endorse him for Kubuntu membership -- ScottKitterman

David has been doing a great job on the Kubuntu Docs for both Karmic and Lucid, he is great to work with and should be an excellent official membership in Kubuntu and Ubuntu.  David has worked on helping with the testing for the Netbook preview release in Karmic and also in Lucid.  +1 for me to membership in Ubuntu Doc Committers and also Ubuntu/Kubuntu membership -- JonathanJesse

There is not too much I can say about David that has not been proclaimed in the testimonials former to this humble addition. I am proud to say that in my time in the community, the list of those that I not only relish working with, but respect and look up to, has done nothing but grow. I have the distinct honor to say that David holds one of those spots. There are seldom few with such personal drive, work ethic and rampant thirst for information greater then that of David. I say without reserve, hesitation, quiver or dishonesty that he would be an outstanding addition to the Kubuntu community. -- <nowiki>[[paultag|Paul Tagliamonte]]</nowiki>

I don't even know where to begin here. David is seriously my hero for the Lucid release. I put out a call for help during the first week, if not sooner for the Kubuntu Documentation rewrite plans. David answered, and within 2 weeks, you would have sworn David was me, just a bit nicer. He not only stepped up and helped out, but he also hit the ground running and in no time was helping to lead the effort by helping me lead about 4 or 5 other people. He is now helping with upstream KDE documentation as well. I think David is the first of his type that I have witnessed in the 5+ years I have been around. For someone to come in from the streets, and brand new tot he game, and then to be classified and looked upon as a leader, truly shows that David is exactly what being an Ubuntu Member is all about -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:nixternal]]</nowiki> 
David has been actively promoting KDE and Kubuntu for some time now.  When we've worked together through <nowiki>[[CaliforniaTeam|California Ubuntu]]</nowiki>, he's always been enthusiastic and helpful.  David really understands the concept of ubuntu, and I'm certain the Mississippi LoCo will be a rising star in the USTeam project.  I'm very impressed with the work he's done for the Kubuntu Documentation project and with the dedication he's shown.  I'd be proud to have him as a fellow Ubuntu member. -- NathanHaines

David has a great understanding of what Beginners Team is, and would make an excellent member of the council. His ability to give assistance with those learning Ubuntu and Kubuntu is commendable. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:charlie-tca]]</nowiki> 
Working with David in both the Ubuntu and Android community has been great. David is an extremely skilled and passionate open source contributor. He is one of the most giving people I have had the chance to work with, in terms of sharing knowledge and working many hours on various projects. I look forward to working with him in the future on any projects we happen to cross paths on. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:steven.richards]]</nowiki> 
All of the above + David is highly engaged in the Kubuntu community. As one of the drivers of the Kubuntu documentation efforts and doing active testing he is one of those people without Kubuntu could not uphold its high quality standards. By being very active in LoCo matters he also presents an important link to the LoCo world, something I came to appreciate a lot. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:apachelogger]]</nowiki>
