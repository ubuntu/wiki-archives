'''About Me'''

I am currently a systems administrator for several SMB's in Simcoe County and surrounding areas. Primarily I work on Windows enviroments but also have 1 or 2 Novell enviroments still kicking around. I have been a Linux user since 2002 and first tried Ubuntu in 2005 and have been hooked ever since. I have been activly promoting Ubuntu to friends an family and have also introduced it to some IT collegues of mine. I am eager to participate in any way to the continued success of the Ubuntu distro.
