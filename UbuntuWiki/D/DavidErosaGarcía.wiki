Hi.

I'm currently a developer at <nowiki>[[http://www.juntadeandalucia.es/averroes/guadalinex/|C.G.A of C.E of Junta de Andalucia]]</nowiki>.

The C.G.A is the control center of ITC schools. There are about 850 ITC schools connected to the same net. Every school has one computer each two pupils and that computer runs a modified version of Ubuntu called [WWW] Guadalinex.
