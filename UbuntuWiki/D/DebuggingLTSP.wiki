__TOC__

==== This page lists some helpful steps when filing an ltsp bug ====

* It is very helpful if you include version numbers of the ltsp (or ltspfs) packages in your bug report (see below how to get the right version numbers for the various packages).
* If you modified any defaults in your thin client chroot, please mention this.
* Did you change anything in your lts.conf file (until gutsy in /opt/ltsp/i386/etc/, later in /var/lib/tftpboot/ltsp/i386/), if so, please attach it.
* Architecture: x86 or amd64
* Please tell how to reproduce the bug.
* See also: HelpingWithBugs

Get the versions of the packages:
<pre>
dpkg -l ltsp-server
dpkg -l ltsp-server-standalone
dpkg -l --root=/opt/ltsp/i386 ldm
dpkg -l --root=/opt/ltsp/i386 ltsp-client
dpkg -l --root=/opt/ltsp/i386 ltsp-client-core # gutsy only
</pre>

Is your bug related to local devices:

<pre>
dpkg -l ltspfs
dpkg -l --root=/opt/ltsp/i386 ltspfsd
</pre>

==== Debugging speed problems ====

===== Debugging tools =====
These tools you could use to monitor some speed problems, so you could find the bottlenecks:

* LatencyTop (http://www.latencytop.org) This tools monitors on what actions give the most latency in a process
* PowerTop (http://lesswatts.org/projects/powertop) (aptitude install powertop); PowerTOP is a Linux tool that helps you find those programs that are misbehaving while your computer is idle.
* SystemTap (http://sourceware.org/systemtap) (aptitude install systemtap); Very flexible/scriptable diagnostics tool
* xrestop (http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/xrestop) (aptitude install xrestop); Gives a top like interface on the processes which uses the most X-resources
* Cacti with snmpd (http://www.cacti.net/) (aptitude install cacti snmpd snmp); For monitoring system and network usage. Needs some work to setup
* Munin (http://munin.projects.linpro.no/) (aptitude install munin); Also for monitoring system and network usage. Easy to setup.
* ntop(http://www.ntop.org/) (aptitude install ntop); For network traffic monitoring.
* BootChart (aptitude install bootchart); For monitoring bootup speed. See also: http://www.hamilton.ie/gavinmc/edubuntu/bootchart.html and LtspBootPerformance
* See also: DebuggingProcedures

===== Configuration check =====
These things you need to check if they are working correctly on your system:

* Video drivers on the server (are they installed correctly?). You can check that via the /var/log/Xorg.0.log if the drivers are loaded correctly. Search for (WW), (EE) and (!!). The command `cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log | egrep '(\(EE\)|\(WW\)|\(!!\))'` should help you filter it.
* Video drivers on the client. Same as for the server, but now on a running LTSP client.
* Check if disk/file indexing is turned on on the server. This will give some disk usage. Which can slow the system down.
* Memory per client
* Disk usage per client
* For locking with sound, you could try to use PulseAudio fully. (in lts.conf: SOUND_DAEMON=pulse)
* Try another Window Manager (like ICEWM). It could be that Gnome is very slow. If that speeds up, you know what might be the problem.
* Check the load average with the command uptime.

==== Bugs not directly with LTSP, but affect LTSP environments ====

* Policykit not allowing remote sessions (Both ssh -X that ltsp uses, and NX sessions) to access admin functionality:

===== Orphane processes =====
* gvfs-fuse sessions hanging around: https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gvfs/+bug/252796
* gconfd-2 hanging around: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gconf2/+bug/269541
* bonobo-activation-server
* <nowiki>[[http://logicalnetworking.net/other/watchdog.txt|LNS watchdog.txt from a school site that contains syslog info from gnome-watchdog]]</nowiki>

==== Workarounds / Solutions ====
 
* Workaround: For the ophrane processes, you can install gnome-watchdog (http://logicalnetworking.net/other/gnome-watchdog_0.9.2_i386.deb)
