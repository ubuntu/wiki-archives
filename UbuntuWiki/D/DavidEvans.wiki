__TOC__

DavidEvans is a professional graphic designer based in Louisiana, USA. 

== TimeVault ==
His work in the Linux community includes logo design for branding of the open-source application <nowiki>[[TimeVault]]</nowiki>. The use of a Mobius Loop for the logo and it's related software iconography is derived from the basic concept of the program's operation and how that applies to time. Colors red and green were applied in opposition to one another to illustrate the perceived start-stop process of TimeVault's file backup. These colors also communicate a metaphorical "catch-and-release" treatment of data as it is saved and recalled.

=== Professional Background ===
DavidEvans received his degree from Louisiana State University's College of Design and has practiced graphic design in print and web media for 13 years, at one time operating as part owner of an advertising and Internet development agency.
