__TOC__

Drupal add-ons (modules) to consider for the Edubuntu website.

Note: This page lists all modules that sound useful, grouped by categories found on the drupal.org site, in alphabetical order. Also note, some of the module might not have been ported to work with the latest release yet (Drupal 6.x).

=== Drupal Core Modules (Issues) ===

* Blog API - Posts submitted via Blog API can't be assigned their Taxonomy.
* Form submit - rapidly clicking on the submit button of a form will result in duplication of nodes/users, see discussion and suggested solution at http://drupal.org/node/107358 alternatively, if an immediate solution is needed, try the 'form single' module http://drupal.org/project/formsingle
* Upload - ''Don't enable this?'' Possibly use 'IMCE' or 'File framework' instead. Update: file handling in Drupal 5.x is still sub-optimal, a new file api is being worked on.
** See "Race condition in upload module" - http://drupal.org/node/11060
** See "making upload.module more scalable with a better directory structure" - http://drupal.org/node/28769

* Note: there are different approaches to adding and managing videos to a Drupal site:

*** (B) Upload video as nodes, allows taxonomy, permissions, etc for individual images
*** (C) Upload (multiple) video(s) as CCK fields (filefield), positioning is pre-defined by the template, note: it's possible to create a content type with one video only (i.e. a video as a node)
*** (D) Videos bulk-uploaded to webserver
*** (E) Embedding third-party videos (from !YouTube, etc.)
** Display
*** (i) Display via client-side flash player (direct embedding of flash content)
*** (ii) Display via server-side flash players for advanced features like playlists, theming (logo overlay, custom player colors & controls), scripted events, etc.
** Asset Management
*** (1) Browse video files on the server
*** (2) Organise videos into playlists
*** (3) Web video editing (trim clips, add soundtrack, transitions, text, ...)
