=== Summary ===

The specification describes the changes that will be made to the default messaging and communication applications selection in karmic

=== Release Note ===

This section should include a paragraph describing the end-user impact of this change.  It is meant to be included in the release notes of the first release in which it is implemented.  (Not all of these will actually be included in the release notes, at the release manager's discretion; but writing them is a useful exercise.)

It is mandatory.

=== Rationale ===

The ubuntu desktop tries to select the applications which best serve its users.

=== User stories ===

* Jorge and Daniel are discussing community work over IM, they decide that having a quick video chat would be faster, they click on the video icon in their buddy list and the conference starts immediately
* The desktop experience team is looking on how to integrate better presence and contacts to the desktop environment, the telepathy stack is modular and will make their job easier

=== Design ===

* Don't install ekiga by default, it's not an application most users are running, take lot of cd space and having it in universe will make community work easier
* Switch from pidgin to empathy early in the karmic cycle
* Get feedback on how empathy is working for users compared to pidgin
* Review the connection managers feature and the libpurple integration for each protocole and decide on the telepathy packages to install
* Look to the feedback receive are feature freeze and decide to stay on the switch or to delay to after the next lts

==== Migration ====

Empathy does import the pidgin accounts already
