=== Command output ===
* I'm no genius on the cli, but couldn't the commands of the section on USB printers https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingPrintingProblems#USB%20printer be altered so it makes a set of files which a user can attach? I suppose they'd be called something like lsmod_usb.txt, var_log_messages.txt and lpinfo.txt. As I say I can't remembe how to do this but think it would be easier for your average Joe. PS.

=== Troubleshooting Wizard ===
* I am using Linux Mint 12 with Gnome Classic. I cannot follow the instructions to get the Troubleshooting Wizard to work. This desktop does not have System-> Administration. Going to System Settings-> Printers is no help. Any suggestions?---- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:d-liell170]]</nowiki>
