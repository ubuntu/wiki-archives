=== About Me ===
39 years old front end programmer and IT professional, with an itch to improve and contribute to each product that falls into his hands. Lives in La Plata, Argentina, coding markup and PHP for a living, wishing he could have more time for pure UX design.

=== Why here ===
Contribute, learn!

I love UIs, and Linux is currently the best playground you can have.
Sadly, I have not enough time to contribute with more tangible work (coding, design), but I can test things and report back ideas :D

=== Geek facts ===
* First computer: Sinclair ZX81
* Best hardware ever: Timex Sinclair TS2068
* Close one: Asus eeePC 1000H
* Time spent tuning the desktop: weeks
* Timespan OS reinstall: ~4 years
* Picky?: YES!
