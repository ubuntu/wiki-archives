== Meta ==

I've been an active Linux Kernel contributor since 2002, using Linux personally since 1999 and professionally since 2001. In 2004, I switched from Redhat to Ubuntu as it became clear there was the dynamism needed to bring Linux to a wider audience, began contributing to Ubuntu in 2005.

Previously, I was developing software at <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrics|Quadrics]]</nowiki>; now I work at <nowiki>[[http://www.numascale.com|NumaScale]]</nowiki> at the pre-OS and kernel-level.
