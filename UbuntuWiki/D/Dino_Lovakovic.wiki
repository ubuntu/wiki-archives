My name is Dino Lovaković (pronounced: Deeno Lovakovich). My first use of free software was in the middle of 2010, with Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid Lynx LTS. At the time, Ubuntu was, and has stayed, the only OS on my computer. Since then, I am a big fan of open source and especially Ubuntu, primarily because of the options that allow me to really control my computer, unlike some other operating systems. But, the thing that made me the biggest fan was the idea of free software itself, ability to help others, and to give something back to the community.

My contributions to Ubuntu Community are limited only to translations on Croatian language, at the time. Hopefully, with time, I will shape-up my computer languages skills, so I will be able to further assist Ubuntu Community around the world.
