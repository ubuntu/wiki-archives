__TOC__

I'm a christian medical doctor, webdesigner and Ubuntu enthusiast.  I first found Ubuntu when it was in its Breezy release and have grown to love it as a distro.  I'd love to see more folk using it and plan to help in whatever way I can to get more people using Ubuntu and making it the best distro it can be.
