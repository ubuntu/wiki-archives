=== Outstanding actions from last meeting ===

* MacSlow to update clutter to appropriate version, not worrying about parallel install:
     Package in PPA, but not yet suitable for upload, so still outstanding.
* seele to follow up with Jono about usability testing swag:
     No reply from Jono.

     Doing so.

=== Actions from this meeting ===

* MacSlow to update clutter to appropriate version, not worrying about parallel install
* seele to follow up with Jono about usability testing swag
* MacSlow to merge goffice, seb128 to help him understand what's going on

=== Problems with merging goffice ===

MacSlow has encountered problems whilst merging goffice, which is needed for gnumeric.  The package was modified in Ubuntu to build different variants for Ubuntu and Xubuntu, whilst in Debian debug packages have been added.

seb128 seemed to know about the changes, so was asked to help MacSlow with the merge.

* UbuntuSpec:compiz-intrepid mostly tweaks, unless we want to use the glxclip plugin and not wait for dri2
* UbuntuSpec:kernel-abi-package-handling, the apt bits are tricky with the two dimensional design that is proposed, especially because it looks like the aptitude and smart resolver need to be modified too (smart for landscape love)
* UbuntuSpec:upgrade-testing-in-the-sandbox, I would like to give people the ability to clone there machine into a VM and run a upgrade test there

* some improvements to the auto upgrade tester: libvirt and snapshots for better debgging of failures

=== Activity reports ===

==== Jonathan Riddell (Riddell) ====

Done:
* mostly packaging KDE 4.1 beta 2
* advising/helping community with their backport of 4.1 beta 2 to hardy
* final merges
* a couple hours of archive admin
* playing with seeds, still some bits to work out for an installable kubuntu-desktop

Blocked:
* 1 main inclusion report still needing review
* Kubuntu website

Next week:
* hardy .1?

No milestoned bugs

==== Kenneth Wimer (kwwii) ====

* finished stage 2 of the murrine theme. The input box bg is quite dark in order to work around bugs in firefox preferences and other wierd widgets.

* finished first stage of a new metacity theme. The buttons are not really ready and I'd liek to somehow show the "clickable" area better (to make moving the windows easier).

* Packaged all of this for intrepid (ubuntu-artwork as well to set the defaults). Removed the dependency on ubuntulooks and included a legacy light-colored theme based on murrine as well. Also made a PPA out of the above for hardy...screenshot of theme attached

PPA available at https://launchpad.net/~kwwii/+archive

<nowiki>[[File:murrine-theme.jpg]]</nowiki>

* wallpaper ideas until now attached...nothing far enough along to really present, but some ideas nontheless :-)

<nowiki>[[File:energy.jpg]]</nowiki>
<nowiki>[[File:hardy-style.jpg]]</nowiki>
<nowiki>[[File:ibex-mod.jpg]]</nowiki>

* looked into two ideas for usplash refresh

==== Martin Pitt (pitti) ====

Holiday reminder: I will be on vacation from Friday to next Tuesday.

Intrepid specs I am drafting:
* intrepid-device-permissions, consolidate-spell-checkers, kernel-abi-package-handling, jockey-printer-driver-support:
 to be reviewed by Scott
 
* drafting: guest account (still waiting for upstream feedback)

Currently open milestoned bugs (8.04.1): None

Merges:
* Done: libnjb
* All done, except for belocs-locales-bin, which is a poinless merge (tiny FTBFS NMU, but it builds fine on intrepid); I'm going to ignore this one, unless someone wants me to do it for the purpose of cleaning the MoM list

Other non-chores work this week:
* Played with PackageKit, updated to latest version, made it work on Intrepid, uploaded; I also sent the patches upstream and got upstream git commit access (4 h)
* Fought with PolicyKit to use it from Python programs (which is not obvious due to not having Python bindings for libpolkit{,-auth}.).  I understand it now. (4 h)
* Split Jockey into a system D-BUS backend (PolicyKit controlled) and an unprivileged UI. This gets rid of some nasty hacks in the code, makes it much more portable, and paves the way for the killall-gksudo and jockey-printer-driver-support specs. (25 h)
* jockey-printer-driver-support: Discussed shared implementation of local printer detection and openprinting.org driver query with Tim Waugh, in a split-out library from system-config-printer. Found out that he already implemented most of it. Had an initial look, stuff looks mostly good. Will work further with him to get it perfect for our purposes. I plan to package it, and integrate it into Jockey in the next two weeks. (1 h)
* Scrutinized Dustin's ecryptfs mount suid program (1 h)
