Session notes

=== Interface ===

Provide dbus interface that starts when we need it. Dbus to provide language
aggnostic way.

Interface:
* querry for specific appliation service
* querry profile manager
* account creation (maybe only for ubuntu.net initially, but we can    provide others by providing a URL)

When passwords are needed the interface provides back a pointer to gnome-keyring
so that all the passwords are stored in the keyring. The API should be done
in a way that is keyring agnostic too so that kde can provide a interface
to kwallet.

Trying to conntact the service provides (google, yahoo) with the design
document should be done. To check if they are ok with us providing the
integration. 

=== Example app ===
* a possible example application would be python-launchpad-bugs for the OAuth

=== Future work ===
* possible integration of this into a directory service so that the profiles   are automatically setup in a cooperate environment
