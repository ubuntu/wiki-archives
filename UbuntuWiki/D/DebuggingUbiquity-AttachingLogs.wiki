__TOC__

=== Uploading log files after an installer crash ===

If you wish to provide a bug report of a crashed installer it is important to also include the relevant log files. These can be found in the Live CD file system just after the crash happened.

Please take into account that the log files would be at one of two different places depending if you're still with the LiveCD or if your system has been already installed.

If you're still at the LiveCD environment the files will be in `/var/log/`

If you've had just installed the System the files will be in  `/var/log/installer`

=== Filing a bug ===

The crash report window will pop up. It asks you to file <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubiquity/+filebug|a bug under the ubiquity package]]</nowiki>. Follow the instructions to add a summary and description. Please copy and paste the 'traceback' displayed, and describe what stage you were at when it crashed.

=== Adding an attachment ===

When you have entered the text and saved it you can add further attachments. Click '''Add a comment/attachment''' at the bottom of the bug webpage.

Clicking '''Browse''' will open a file browser in your ubuntu home directory. Click on the disk icon to get to the base of the file system and then the <code>var</code> and <code>log</code> folders to get to <code>/var/log</code>.

=== The /var/log/syslog file ===

On newer systems (6.10 and up) this is often the most important file and should be attached to crash reports.

After installation, this is saved as `/var/log/installer/syslog`.

=== The /var/log/partman file ===

If the installer crashes at or beyond the partition stage (the re-organizing of your hard disk), then this file is also likely to be important.

After installation, this is saved as `/var/log/installer/partman`.

=== /var/log/installer/syslog ===

On 6.06, the <code>/var/log/installer/syslog</code> file contains the key installer logs (later moved to <code>/var/log/syslog</code>). If you experience errors with 6.06 we would encourage you to also try the install with a later edition of the Ubuntu CD and add comments about that to your bug report.

=== /var/log/installer/debug ===

Sometimes a developer may ask you to reproduce a problem by running <code>ubiquity --debug</code> from a terminal, and to attach this file. It contains a full debug trace of all ubiquity's communications with debconf.
