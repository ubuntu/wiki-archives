* Jonathan to track down who is working on bug #290695, set assignee, and clarify status -- done, in -proposed now

* Everyone to think about what they would like to work on in Jaunty -- covered in agenda below

=== Actions from this meeting ===

* Martin to talk to beuno to put the desktop team meeting at the fridge
* Everyone to register their specs and propose for "uds-jaunty" by the end of the week

=== Meeting reminder ===

Several people complained about not being notified hard enough about
the meeting. Some appreciate the weekly reminder emails, and many
would like to have it in in the Fridge, and thus in Evolution. Thus
Martin will send out reminder emails every Monday afternoon.

=== intrepid-updates bugs ===

Martin asked about difficulties with getting the intrepid-updates
milestoned bugs fixed and reminded everyone to get them fixed by UDS,
since we'll heavily work on Jaunty afterwards.

The only reported difficulty was the kde4libs SRU, which apparently
rendered several other KDE packages to fail to build. Jonathan and
Michael Casadevall are investigating and working on it.

Seb pointed out that GNOME 2.24.2 is due next week, but we will not do
the full updates as for Hardy, only some prominent packages which fix
high-visibility bugs, such as Evolution.

Jonathan will create SRU tracking bugs for moving KDE 4.1.3 packages
in intrepid-backports to -proposed.

=== Jaunty plans ===

For Jaunty, the desktop team wants to concentrate on bug triage
catch-up, bug fixing, and cleanup. So far there do not seem to be
major structural changes coming from upstreams, except kernel
modesetting (whose adoption in Jaunty isn't decided yet), so this is
an ideal cycle for working on stability and quality.

* Arne: continue to work on fonts, language-selector, font-selector, plus a new item: ibus (a candidate to replace scim); will register specs for language-selector UI improvements and ibus
* Bryce: assist on some that ubuntu-x community members are taking the lead on (config tools), switch -ati from XAA to EXA, work on ongoing X.org testing (XSmoke), work on OEM X.org bugs, put a lot of time into getting distro X bugs closed as I'm having good momentum with upstream at getting fixes
* Chris: get release exception and OOo 3.1 in, get OOo languages switched to Pootle/Rosetta (will register spec), get OOo split builds working
* Jonathan: https://wiki.kubuntu.org/KubuntuJauntySpecs; mainly focusing on UI cleanup and bug fixing, too
* Martin: concentrate on triaging and fixing bugs, robustifying the apport retracers (UbuntuSpec:apport-retracer-maintenance), and working on CD downsizing
* Sebastien: concentrate on bug fixing, plus the usual GNOME 2.26.x
