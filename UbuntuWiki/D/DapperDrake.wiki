| Mostly the main utilities/libraries are done and test, the UI interface and things that depend on it have been deferred to Dapper due to the fact that there is no workable UI interface yet. Bounty Goal has been deferred also, its development continues with the possibility of being exacpted as standard by upstream.

(2005-08-05) squidguard moves to main, squid already is and ogra will make a default blacklist package this weekend from the default blacklists squidguard upstream offers. Deferred as not completed in time for Breezy.

| For the Technical use cases, not attempting root on iscsi In the implementation plan:   Creation of archive of kernel modules isn't done. It's modeled internally in the code, but more study needs to be done to figure out how this will affect people who build custom kernels. Add ability to concatenate CPIO files to grub version 1.  mdz expressed concern about us having features in grub that weren't in other versions of grub. Upstream has stopped all development on grb 1, and will not accept the patch. They have agreed to the patch for grub 2, which may be usable in time for 6.04. hotplug-ng is a dead project, so this target was implemented in a different way. User space partition detections is a research topic (upstream hasn't talked about the idea in a serious way yet) Partition label / UUID handling is a trivial post-breezy item (And was marked as such in the proposal).It was blocked from Breezy by UVF. A further step that should be added for 6.04 is the final unification of the hotplug detection systems. The Linux Kernel version 2.6.12, integrated much of the hardware detection by exposing "modalias" files in the sysfs hierarchy. This greatly simplifies the coldplugging process. We should also explore the possibility of capturing and replaying hotplug events, however, since that would be that transitory events would still be noticed and could be either acted upon or logged.

| LinuxKernelRoadmap
| fabbione
| infinity
| chmj
| (2005-08-16) Most of this goal was completed, but several minor features were deferred, namely * evaluate cost of enabling SMP on UP. If performance hit is low enough, drop UP kernels. DEFERRED: we have a major issue with some -smp kernels showing extra bugginess compared to the UP version, mainly in these subsystems like USB that are very common on desktops. * evaluate cost of running generic kernels versus optimized kernels.If performance hit is low, drop optimized (k7, etc) kernels. DEFERRED: from a fast look at the code there are too many differences on how certain CONFIG_ values are set. Some of them are related to cache allignement. Bringing in a non-optimized kernel will hit badly on the cache and as a consequence on performance. * generate non-supported-linux-kernel-modules.(high priority: asap)  DEFERRED: this is only a packaging problem and from a first cut, it might involve more headackes than the one it solves. * Defer enhancing ABI check for now; improvements to this can come over time. (low priority: before FeatureFreeze) DEFERRED: current method is still working fine, even if requires a bit of manual fiddling. * Unify Debian and Ubuntu kernel packaging. Drop dpatch, and add centralized config file generation/management. (possibly use cdbs2) (low priority: decision beeds to be taken within 2 months) DEFERRED: debian arrived too late to match FeatureFreeze. Not enough resources to complete it in time.  *Add infrastructure to autobuild git/bk snapshots from upstream. DEFERRED: not enough resources to implement it. * Add a hook to kernel image's postinst to call out to module-assistant. Create -source packages for 3rd party modules requested by users. DEFERRED: not enough resources to implement it.

| Deferred due to time constraints. (2005-08-05) the only part of LiveCDFeatures likely to land is adding unionfs as an option for COW which would be a nice performance boost, and would allow us to take a decision later about which one to use as default. Should push that in over the weekend the rest is deferred

| (2005-09-06) mono is in main & all targetted apps are packaged and in universe, they need stabilization to move back to main. Novell is doing a ton of that work to get them in suse 10 but too late for breezy.Probably beagle, f-spot, and monodevelop are the hotest items to move to main, this is deferred to Dapper

| NetworkAuthentication

| (2005-07-30) Currently looking at the config editor provided in patch 10273,working on debconf support for base-files. The basic work still should go into breezy. (2005-08-10) adding the nsswitch.conf configuration tool to base-config, included a debconf configuration. modifying the nis package with debconf support to act as a nis client and modifying the nsswitch.conf with the nsswitch.conf config tool. the same has to be done with every other authentication method.  I doubt, that I can implement debconf support for all these methods in breezy time frame, as I need to setup server support for these methods as well. (2005-08-16) Deferred - no time to complete for Breezy.

Freeze exceptions needed to bring in new versions of supporting components, these are approved and should be in progress. (2005-08-16) ogra is just writing a new main inclusion report (the package names changed) and have to integrate with gdm.... (1-2 workdays) (2005-08-19) It isn't in desktop yet it needs adjustment... the design is very similar to network manager and it needs similar but easier changes you can use it as is from universe currently to display the status of all battery driven devices, but you cant manage them yet.

Also been working on GL transition to Mesa with adconrad. (2005-08-15) libraries complete, applications mostly complete, XKB transition mostly complete.  Server and Mesa work ongoing now; server works on all platforms, Mesa now contains DRI.  Roadmap to completion: transition to Mesa as the sole GL provider, transition to the modular server and thus drivers.  Plan is to put experimental packages on p.u.c within two weeks, get community testing, and then upload to Breezy after community testing. Some parts of this goals Deferred to Dapper - no time to complete for Breezy.
