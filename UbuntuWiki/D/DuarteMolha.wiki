== About me ==

Hello.

I am PhD Student on the subject of Bioinformatics and Comparative genomics at University of Ulster, UK

I have completely adopted ubuntu linux as my OS. And with the expection of a few proprietary drivers and applications that currently I cannot find a replacement I try to only use free software.

My main interests are on scientific software in the area of bioinformatics and science in general although I love to learn everything about emerging technology.
