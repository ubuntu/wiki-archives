Email: 
I am a recent user of Ubuntu Linux, though with several years of experience
with Debian GNU/Linux.

My current Ubuntu machine is an Acer Aspire 5002 WLMi, running breezy-amd64.
Feel free to contact me by email if you want to share your experiences,
especially concerning running Ubuntu on this specific hardware.

I prefer KDE to Gnome, so while I used a Ubuntu install disk, one of the first
things I did post-install was `apt-get install kubuntu-desktop'.

==== Questions ====

Notes on a couple of things I haven't figured out (yet).  Some of them might
yet lead to bug reports.

* How to prevent Kscd from popping up every time I insert an audio CD into my drive
 (I prefer to use amaroK, in spite of its silly name ;-) Other than uninstalling Kscd
 of course.

* The integrated soundcard works fine, but the KDE mixer seems confused -
 operating the master volume control has no effect, instead the headphone
 volume control operates both on the headphone output and builtin speakers.
 BTW I don't like stuff like the control labeled "IEC958 Playback AC97" -
 I don't have a clue what it means, and no explanation is provided either
 in a tooltip nor in the help file :(

* How to customize kdm's login screen - KDE's usual settings module for kdm
 doesn't seem to work in Kubuntu.

* There should be some simple way to dump downloaded podcasts (mp3 files)
 to my portable player (flash drive) from amaroK, perhaps it's so well hidden
 I didn't find it. Instead, I figured out where amaroK stores thoses files (deep down under 
 ~/.kde/) - but I suspect many users would have a problem doing that.

* Copying one particular podcast mp3 file (via the file manager) to my player's flash drive
 was failing mysteriously; I went around checking and re-checking permissions for a
 while, until I realized someone had cleverly used a colon character (':') in the filename,
 and the likely reason for the failure was that this isn't allowed on FAT filesystems
 (am I correct about this?). Is it too much to expect some message like "Illegal character
 in filename"?

* Sleep mode & hibernation: bah, seems hopeless :( Actually I could expect problems
 with getting suspend-to-disk to work, since I configured my system without a swap
 partition (hey, with 1 GB of RAM a laptop shouldn't need any swap). I figure
 the standard suspend-to-disk can't work with a swapFILE (as opposed to 
 a swap PARTITION). I did have hopes for a working suspend-to-RAM though
 (much faster), but while the system does suspend cleanly (so it seems..), 
 it doesn't restore - haven't been able to figure out the reason yet.

* Konqueror "simplification" by Kubuntu seems a little overdone IMHO -
 I haven't yet found any way to re-enable some of Konq's nifty features, 
 like splitting the window, or firing up an embedded konsole.

* If I set the integrated VGA to use 128 MB of memory for video RAM, the built-in
 Broadcom wireless refuses to work (under Linux; it works fine regardless in Windows).
 With my usual setting of 64 MB it works great (this is a BIOS setting).
