* Added music library to Rhythmbox: FLAC, 3328 tracks
* Took all R.E.M. tracks (66) and dragged them onto iPod
* Copy icon, no action
* Created an "R.E.M." playlist, can't drag that to iPod
* Played "Leaving New York" to ensure Rhythmbox could understand FLAC (sounds like crap on internal speaker, stop that)
* Can't copy single track either
* Select iPod and try and play the LUG Radio track downloaded.  Play is selected, time never gets off 0:00:00.
