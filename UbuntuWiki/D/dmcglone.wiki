=== Contributions ===

At the moment, I haven't done anything much along the lines of contributing, except maybe a bug report and answering a few questions in IRC.

=== Future Goals ===

Although, I'm still feeling things out to find where I best fit in the community, my main goal is to become an integral part of the Ubuntu Ohio team, by helping with bug fixes, event planning and participation to ultimately bring awareness to Ubuntu.
