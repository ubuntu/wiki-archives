Specifications tell us how to get from our current desktop to the <nowiki>[[DesktopTeam-Experiences|user experiences]]</nowiki> and user stories we have written.  They might define a new plugin for an existing application, modifications that should be made to it, changing one application for another or developing new applications altogether.

We use the <nowiki>[[https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu|Launchpad Blueprint]]</nowiki> tracker for Ubuntu to track our specifications, with their text as pages under this one.
