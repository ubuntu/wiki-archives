=== Celtic Ubuntu Groups ===
==== Ubuntu Translation Teams ====

* <nowiki>[[https://translations.edge.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-l10n-br|Breton]]</nowiki> 
* <nowiki>[[https://translations.edge.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-l10n-ie|Irish]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[https://translations.edge.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-l10n-cy|Welsh]]</nowiki>

Languages without a translation team have been omitted if you speak a Celtic language not listed then feel free to create one and help to translate the Ubuntu project!

==== Ubuntu LoCo Groups ====
LoCo groups strive to build up Local Communities in their area to help spread the word of Ubuntu and assist other local users who may be seeking a little extra help with their setups. Many LoCo teams are highly sociable groups who love to get together to chat on a variety of mediums including: IRC, Jabber, Email & face-to-face meetings.
