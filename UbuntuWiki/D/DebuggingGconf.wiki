__TOC__

If you ask people to run tests with `gconftool-2`, you sometimes need to ask them to set a `GCONF_CONFIG_SOURCE`.

In <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gconf2/+bug/90314|bug 90314]]</nowiki> the resulting command is:
`GCONF_CONFIG_SOURCE=xml:readwrite:/var/lib/gconf/defaults sudo gconftool-2 --makefile-install-rule /usr/share/gconf/schemas/yelp.schemas`
