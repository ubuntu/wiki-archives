=== Cherry-picking changes from Debian ===

Debian had made a change to emacspeak in the 28.0-2 upload, but Ubuntu only had 26.0-3. I wanted just the changes
to fix that bug. I had to "apt-get source emacspeak", then go to the PTS and grab the source of Debian's (is there
an easier way to do that). I then had to identify the changes in the Debian package, and create a diff against the
Ubuntu version.

If both were available in bzr then I could have done "bzr branch lp:ubuntu/intrepid/emacspeak" and then "bzr merge -c 1
lp:debian/unstable/emacspeak", then "bzr reverted" the bits that I didn't want.
