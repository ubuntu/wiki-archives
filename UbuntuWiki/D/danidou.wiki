=== About me ===
My name is Daniel LeBlanc.  I've been a Linux user since 2002, and I've promoted Ubuntu to family, friends and Comp. Sc. students for many years.  I like to dabble in many different things, like application development and web design, but also literature, politics, etc.  I am an RPG enthusiast, I love cooking, and my wife Emilie and I just purchased our first house, where we live happily with our cat Oberon.

=== Ubuntu ===
I've been a Ubuntu user for many years, and the official "guru" for all my "converted" friends, colleagues and family members.  I feel that I haven't done enough for the community, which is why I now wish to actively contribute in any way possible, either as a developer, a documentation specialist, a translator or a designer.  I'm eager to learn and to help!
