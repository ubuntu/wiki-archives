== About me ==

My name is Nick, though I go by the strange name of durksauce in most forums. I am currently a student working toward a BS in Computer Science and have always held a strong interest in Linux (or GNU/Linux, if you're into that kind of thing). It started out as a political stance, but these days I am more interested in the software and community building. I am still pretty new to the game and I expect to make many mistakes, with that, I hope to take away a better understanding of software development and with any luck give something back to Linux and the community in return. I look forward to getting more involved in the community and finding projects to work on.

Cheers!
