__TOC__

I'm a early 30-something semi-drooling, cantankerous layabout, who makes his clams in the magazine publishing industry. 

My spare time is spent drinking, smoking, muttering, banging my head to metal, beating the elderly while wearing a skirt (also known as Aikido) and being a full-fledged, paranoid, computer nerd.

Right now, I'm using Kubuntu and Xubuntu 6.10 on my computers. I maintain a few websites, but my main blog can be found at <nowiki>[[http://www.davebgimp.com]]</nowiki>.
