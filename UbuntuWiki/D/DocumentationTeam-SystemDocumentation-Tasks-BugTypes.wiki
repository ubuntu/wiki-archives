__TOC__

<code>CURRENTLY A BRAINSTORMING PAGE ONLY</code>

This page contains a proposal for the classification of bugs in Ubuntu Documentation. The different bug types can be used as tags on Launchpad, allowing new and existing contributors to Ubuntu Documentation easily to find and locate bugs that may interest them.

* <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubuntu-docs/+bugs?field.tag=typo|typo]]</nowiki> - bugs which involve simple typos such as spelling or grammar mistakes.
* <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubuntu-docs/+bugs?field.tag=bitesize|bitesize]]</nowiki> - bugs which are ideal for new contributors and which don't require detailed knowledge of documentation markup.
* <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubuntu-docs/+bugs?field.tag=new-topic|new-topic]]</nowiki> - bugs which involve the creation of an entirely new document or material on a topic which is not currently covered by ubuntu-docs.
* <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubuntu-docs/+bugs?field.tag=serverguide|serverguide]]</nowiki> - bugs which concern the Ubuntu Server Guide.
