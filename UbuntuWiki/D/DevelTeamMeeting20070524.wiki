==== Alexander Sack (asac) ====

Firefox
* started dapper backport of ffox 2.0. The idea is to shake out eventual glitches before we actually need to do the 2.0 transition.
 Patches used so far are in
  http://people.ubuntu.com/~asac/dapper-ffox2-transition/
 Community driven (untested) builds for i386 packages currently land in
  http://gnomefreak.youmortals.com/mozilla-testing/dists/dapper/main/binary-i386/

Firefox Addon Support
* bringing spec to review state
* looking into extension manager code to get a general idea about changes needed in case we want an "alternate install dialog" to pop up when user installs .xpi from the web and we have an Ubuntu equivalent for it.

MOTU work
* reviewing and sponsoring gnome-btdownload, bitstormlite; merging xulrunner
* bzr, packaging and licensing mentoring for torrent team
* upstream discussion with libtorrent rasterbar developer about library name clash (and sonames/ABI-compatibility of libs); unfortunately author appears to not care. Next: try to find a common name of library filename with other distributors.

Other Mozilla Work:
* more work on lightning and sunbird against system libs. State: Still trying to find a decent solution to build sunbird-bin runner binary without rebuilding parts of the (firefox) toolkit from within sunbird sources. Using libxul-dev from xulrunner (instead of thunderbird-dev) appears to be an option.
