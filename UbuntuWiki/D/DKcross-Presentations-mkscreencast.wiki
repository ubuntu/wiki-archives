 Using recordMyDesktop
You can start recordMyDesktop under Applications > Sound & Video > gtk-recordMyDesktop:
<nowiki>[[File:10.jpg]]</nowiki>

This is how its interface looks. You can configure the video and sound quality (if you want to include sound in your screencast; it's also possible to deselect sound); to start a recording, click on Record; the recordMyDesktop window will disappear, and the recording starts.

During the recording, you will see a square button in the taskbar in the upper right corner:

<nowiki>[[File:12.jpg]]</nowiki>

This button allows you to control the recording. By right-clicking the button, you can pause the recording:
<nowiki>[[File:11a.jpg]]</nowiki>

And by left-clicking it, you stop the recording. This will cause the recordMyDesktop-encoder window to apppear; your screencast is now being converted to Theora Ogg:

<nowiki>[[File:13.png]]</nowiki>

 
Afterwards, the recordMyDesktop window appears again. Click on Quit to leave it:

<nowiki>[[File:14.jpg]]</nowiki>

You can now find the screencast in your home folder (Places > Home Folder):

<nowiki>[[File:15.jpg]]</nowiki>
Your screencast is named out.ogv. You can watch it by double-clicking it:

<nowiki>[[File:16.jpg]]</nowiki>

This will open your screencast in the Totem movie player:
