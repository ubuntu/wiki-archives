__TOC__

== General ==

My name is Danny Piccirillo and I am an humanist, environmentalist, activist, and an advocate of digital freedom and subsequently free software and free formats. I live in Newton, Massachusetts, USA, very close to Boston. I am in my Junior year at Newton North High School where I am working with the tech department to adopt free software solutions like Ubuntu, SchoolTool, Drupal, and Moodle. I was born in 1991 and have lived in Newton since I was an infant (though not in the same house). I am an Ubuntero, and an official Ubuntu Member and was approved on <nowiki>[[..-MeetingLogs-CC-20071009|October 9th, 2007]]</nowiki>.

== My Path ==

As a child I valued virtue above all else, whether I was aware of it or not. I loved nature and was as close to an environmentalist as someone that young can be without any real understanding of the greater world of politics built up around him. I valued life, freedom, and truth. As I grew up I became aware of environmental, political, and moral issues plaguing our world. Today, I am a leader of my school's Environmental Club which has taught me a lot about leadership and I have become absorbed in the Digital Freedom movement. So here I am, supporting Ubuntu :)

=== My Interest and Experience with Linux ===

I have had a love for computers and technology since I was very young. I was introduced to computers with Windows so I began with blind faith in Microsoft but my interests in computers inevitably led me to learn about digital rights and free software and formats and the like. I began using Linux when i was 15 years old in late 2006 with Ubuntu 6.10 Edgy Eft and ever since, I have become more and more involved. I am one of the core members of the Ubuntu Massachusetts Team as well as a member of the Ubuntu Marketing Team and the Ubuntu US Team.

==== Outside contributions ====
I advocate Ubuntu at my school and would love to get my city library to switch too. I am working with my school to test out Ubuntu and have gotten the head of the Technology Department to give me a brand new school iMac (right out of the box) to install Ubuntu on and put it out for students to try and give feedback on. So far, so good! 

I help friends and family switch too. Everybody loves it!
