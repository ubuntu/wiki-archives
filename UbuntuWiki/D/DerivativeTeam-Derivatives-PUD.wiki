PUD (Penk's Underbred Distro) GNU/Linux is a Taiwanese mini live and installation CD based on Ubuntu, with ideas borrowed from the LAMPPIX and Damn Small Linux projects, and with support for Traditional Chinese (zh_TW). Its main purpose is to provide a complete Linux desktop with many popular applications and tools, yet remain small and simple to operate.
