=== About Me ===
Hi, I'm Doug.  I've been using Linux since '93, back when many people (myself included) pronounced it "lie nucks" 'cause we didn't know any better.  I use Linux every day both at work and at home.  Debian and Debian derivatives are my favourite distros.  I've recently installed Lubuntu on an older G4 iMac and decided to joing the qa team to help improve the PPC version.  There are lots of G4 and G5 machines out there that have plenty of life left in them and Linux is the OS to give them that life.
