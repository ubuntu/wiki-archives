Hi I'm Duncan Lithgow.

I've been playing with Linux since about 2002.

First I decided Debian had the best philosophy, so I bought the set of 7 Debian CDs. I couldn't install it. A linux sys-admin from the local university came to help me, he gave up as well. I hope they've sorted out their useless installer since then!

The sys-admin gave me a Fedora Core 2 CD set, and that worked fine becasue I was patient and read eveything carefully. I would never give that to an average PC user and expect them to be able to install and configure it. I hope they've improved their installer! 

Because I want to be able to recommend Linux to others I had a look at Ubuntu, and think it's the best balance between user friendliness and the GNU ethos.

Cheers, Duncan
