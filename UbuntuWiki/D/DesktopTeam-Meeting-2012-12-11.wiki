== Agenda ==

* ''Insert things to discuss at meeting here..''

=== Product strategy integration ===

* Daily landing now can tackle dependencies between stacks, to ensure that one stack can't regress another one if a stack is landed withot another.
* We now need autopilot support as some stacks like the indicator one doesn't have integration tests, autopilot installing is worked on to support that case.

==== Unity ====

* Manually release a first daily stack (using every part of the daily landing infra, but testing was manual) of unity into raring!
* This release has some small features released, but especially a fix for having raring rocking the nexus7
* Autopilot tests and fixes to get the unity land daily tested coming soon. Daily landing is disabled until then :)

==== Indicators & Themes ====

* More interesting autopilot case for the indicators, autopilot fixes for supporting and ensuring we don't regress in progress.
