__TOC__

==== Install the packages ====
<pre>
$ sudo apt install libcamera-tools gstreamer1.0-libcamera
</pre>

==== Check that your camera is listed ====
<pre>
$ cam -l
</pre>

==== Capture an image ====
<pre>
$ cam --camera=1 --capture=1 --file=image.ppm
</pre>

NOTE: cam has limited pixel conversion support, the above may not work.

==== Verify that the captured image is correct ====
<pre>
$ eog image.jpg
</pre>

==== Check that the gstreamer plugin is working ====
<pre>
$ gst-launch-1.0 libcamerasrc ! videoconvert ! autovideosink
</pre>

(you might need to specify a camera-name=... if more than 1 camera is available)

==== Run the camera compliance tests ====
<pre>
$ lc-compliance -c "camera_name"
</pre>

(you can get "camera_name" by doing `lc-compliance 2>&1 | tail -n 1 | cut -c 3-`, and yes the name is slightly confusing and include the leading \_ chars)

==== Try an application using libcamera ====

To be added once we have a client software available in the archive
