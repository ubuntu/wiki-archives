=== Presentations ===
Canonical would like to encourage participation and presenting at conferences. Rick to discuss with team members and encourage ideas.

=== Changing the Add/Remove ... ===
The team and community are overall supportive of the notion of changing the label as long as:
1. Usable - users know what it is, and existing users aren't confused.
2. Translatable
3. Cooler than "Add/Remove..."
4. Doesn't make the menu look bad, for example, by being too long
We should test whatever we come up with through user testing, or seb128 could even integrate it into an alpha.

=== Berlin Sprint ===
We discussed possible topics for the upcoming sprint. These are all the *proposed* topics only at this point:
1. fix hotkey
2. fix beamer/projector
3. fix suspend/resume for everyone's laptop
4. fix the intel driver in xorg for i855, 915 and 945 first
5. fix machines that crash when user switching
6. Session with Seb128 and Pitti on efficient bug management
7. Work with Dx team to install new stuff on our laptops
8. Fixing bugs where it is useful to pick brains of our colleagues
9. Finish a great deal of language selector 
10. fixing bugs in apps that dont behave properly on network changes
11. making sure our mysql changes get agreed and in
12. measure everyone's desktop startup speed and work on making them faster
13. Try not allowing GNOME Settings Deamon to force DPI of 96, even if overriding value in xorg.cof

=== Release Status ===
==== Dx Support ====
davidbarth provided an update of the Dx team status:
* mpt has reviewed all of main and universe. davidbarth believes they can patch all applications that use actions in time for Jaunty.
* The last POR regarding handling notifications with actions had to be revisited. The Dx team has a recommendation, but it was not covered in this meeting.
* Will drop patches patched applications as they are patched.
* Already have good support from Mozilla (thanks to asac).
* More on message indicator expected next week, including API
==== New GDM (Universe and Migration) ====
* seb128 will upload the new GDM to universe this week.
* no progress on migrations yet (not slated for Jaunty)

==== Device Kit ====
* Latest DK and DK-power are in universe
* Ted to package new GPM in a PPA, needs to work on his packaging branch
* Jaunty will use version 2.24.3 of GPM, 2.25 requires new GPM, which is not ready

=== Activity reports ===
* All done on time

=== Other Business ===
* seb128 informs us that two things were removed from Alpha CD and moved to supported due to space constraints:
** nautilus-cd-burner (brasero fulfills all the requirements)
** deskbar-applet tracker to supported (disabled by default)
* seb128 brings up that it might be time to revisit GNOME Settings Daemon's behavior of overriding font dpi settings in xorg.conf

==== Alexander Sack (asac) ====
* track mozilla security progress; backport patches and get approval
   for landing for most
* committed a bunch of security patches upstream
* committed fix for moz bug 471359 and asked for approval for 1.9.1
   branch
* evaluated and fixed nss/nspr mini-transition fallout (LP: #316452);
   thanks to mvo who helped using his upgrade testing testing
   infrastructure.
* initial libnotify backport to 1.9.0 branch; status: works, but
   breaks ABI; next: make patch suitable for stable xulrunner branch
   by unbreaking ABI
   https://code.edge.launchpad.net/~asac/xulrunner/xulrunner-1.9.1.head.libnotify
* marked a few pet-bugs
* sponsored liferea (intrepid SRU), network-manager (committed to jaunty
   bzr), evolution-data-server, nmap (jaunty), mozvoikko (jaunty/NEW)
   and seahorse (jaunty)
* drafted most parts for DesktopNetworkChanging spec document (KDE apps missing);
   started to verify individual apps
* wrote down 3GNetworkingJaunty roadmap wiki page (not a spec)
* fix URL escaping bug in gwibber and sent fix upstream and got it merged
   https://code.edge.launchpad.net/~asac/gwibber/bug317073-pasted-url-escaping/+merge/2854

==== Arne Goetje (ArneGoetje) ====
* marking my pet-bugs
* finish the JauntyLanguageSelectorImprovements spec with the help of mpt.
* translations issue: it was discovered that if a translation was
marked as c-format and had format strings where the original msgid
didn't, it might crash applications if the user was running his system
in that language. Since this was considered a security issue and
affected Hardy and Intrepid, this had to be solved urgently. In the
result, we turn on c-format checking in langpack-o-matic when generating
language packs. Also all affected translations need to be fixed in
Launchpad, the translation teams have been notified and are working on
this issue. Also the Launchpad Translations Team is involved in
improving Rosetta to filter out buggy translations.
