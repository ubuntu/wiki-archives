* Draft Schedule
* Freezes normally happen at 2100 UTC, to permit overnight builds to include the last content. Please make sure all changes have been uploaded before then unless agreed to by the release team.
* In general, October releases follow a 25-week schedule, while April releases follow a 27-week schedule, to compensate for year-end holidays (non-LTS releases might break this cycle to wiggle things a bit).

<infinity> (base)adconrad@nosferatu:~$ date -d 'october 12 27 weeks'
<infinity> Thu Apr 19 00:00:00 MDT 2018
<infinity> (base)adconrad@nosferatu:~$ date -d 'october 19 27 weeks'
<infinity> Thu Apr 26 00:00:00 MDT 2018
<infinity> So, if we do a 27wk schedule for 18.04, we release on the 26th.  Which is doable.
<infinity> Assuming a 27wk schedule for 17.10
<infinity> Then we'd go back to 25/27, ish.
<infinity> Except that Easter keeps breaking that every couple of years.
<infinity> Stupid 4-day weekend.
<infinity> The point of 25/27 is that we lose a ton of development time over the year-end break.
<infinity> So 25/27 makes up for that, to a degree.
<infinity> (base)adconrad@nosferatu:~$ date -d 'Thu Apr 26 00:00:00 MDT 2018 25 weeks'
<infinity> Thu Oct 18 00:00:00 MDT 2018
<infinity> Keeping that cadence would put us just past mid-October for 18.10.
<infinity> And then back to Apr25 for the next 04.  Which will break because Apr 21 easter.
<infinity> But that can be another 26 to compensate.
<infinity> Whee.
<infinity> So, I think what works here is "27wk Oct 19, 2017", "27wk Apr 26, 2018", "25wk Oct 18, 2018", "26wk Apr 18, 2019"
<infinity> And I refuse to plan further out than that.

Planning further than that:

(base)adconrad@nosferatu:~$ date -d 'april 18 2019 26 weeks'
Thu Oct 17 00:00:00 MDT 2019
(base)adconrad@nosferatu:~$ date -d 'april 18 2019 53 weeks' (Easter is April 12, so we want to skip a week)
Thu Apr 23 00:00:00 MDT 2020
(base)adconrad@nosferatu:~$ date -d 'april 23 2020 25 weeks'
Thu Oct 15 00:00:00 MDT 2020
(base)adconrad@nosferatu:~$ date -d 'april 23 2020 52 weeks' (Easter is April 4)
Thu Apr 22 00:00:00 MDT 2021
(base)adconrad@nosferatu:~$ date -d 'april 22 2021 25 weeks'
Thu Oct 14 00:00:00 MDT 2021
(base)adconrad@nosferatu:~$ date -d 'april 22 2021 51 weeks' (Easter is April 17)
Thu Apr 14 00:00:00 MDT 2022
