== Introduction ==

My name is '''Daniel !McGuire'''. I was born and raised in the South of Wales in the United Kingdom. I currently study Software Engineering at Cardiff Metropolitan University. 

== Current Projects ==

=== Ubuntu Touch ===
With Unity 8 and Ubuntu Touch I am focusing my work on that part of Ubuntu at this current moment in time.

==== Ubuntu Help App ====
===== App Design =====

I am working on the design for the Ubuntu (touch) Help App.

===== App icon =====

I am also deisging a new icon for the app, here is a working mock up I have created.

With the help of Daniel Holbach I am designing a new theme for the Ubuntu Help App, the application in its current start (version 0.3) is a purely text based, boring app. With my understanding of HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and the Ubuntu HTML5 application protocol interface I am trying to bring a new standard to Ubuntu's HTML5 applications. 

I have other applications in the store which are all my own work.

==== Golf Score Card ====

This is the first application I created for Ubuntu Touch, I did this so early on I received an Ubuntu Pioneers T-Shirt for being one of the first 200 developers to post an application to the store.

==== Uber ====

I also published a simple web app for Ubuntu Touch, the Uber web app is a simple way for people to get Uber on their Ubuntu Phones since it uses Ubers' fantastic mobile site. I have had over 100 downloads for this app, however the two people who reviewed it didn't read the description first...

==== My Cardiff Met ====
My university has a web app that for students and staff to use, I published this to the store because I know of Ubuntu users at my university who in the future will use this.

=== Reddit ===

==== r/UbuntuAppDev ====

I created and I am maintaining the Ubuntu App Dev sub reddit.

==== Ubuntu Community Theme for reddit ====

The Ubuntu community theme is a CSS theme for Ubuntu community related subreddits, I am a big contributor to it and it is activly being used in the <nowiki>[[http://www.reddit.com/r/UbuntuAppDev/| r/UbuntuAppDev]]</nowiki> subbreddit.

** Testing Lubuntu Development Releases

==== WOW Lubuntu ====
{{http://i39.tinypic.com/23v2ix.jpg}}

WOW Lubuntu was project created by amjjawad (a member of Lubuntu family) to enlighten the whole world with the power of Linux generally and Lubuntu specifically and tell the untold story about a unique system that could breath a new life into an ancient machine instead of breathing the dust somewhere in the dark. I joined amjjawad on the 9th of June as a administrator of the page. I have since stopped contributing to this project.

==== Lubuntu Team ====

== Ubuntu Community Involvement ==

== Converted People to Ubuntu ==
I have currently converted 6 people to the Ubuntu operating system. Every user uses and likes Unity and I do offer help whenever they need it.

=== University Group ===
As I mentioned earlier I am studying software engineering in Cardiff Metropolitan University in Wales, at the start of my next year (September 2015) I will be hosting an Ubuntu Group for my peers where we will install Ubuntu on their machine, get their development work flows and applications set up and hopefully actually contribute something back to Ubuntu/Linux.

Because of this interest in Ubuntu I decided to publish the "My Cardiff Met" app to the Ubuntu Store.

== Experience, Skills and Activities ==

1. Excellent understanding of HTML and CSS
2. Very good in Troubleshooting and Support (Installation, Partitioning, Dual-Booting, Multi-Booting, Desktop Environment, Linux Distributions, etc).
3. Very eager about design and UX, I believe it is one of the most important parts of software development that is often over looked. 
4. I actively enjoy doing all the above things and will continue to do so for a very long time.
5. I plan to study design more and become fluent with image manipulation tools such as Gimp and Inkscape.
   

== Testimonials ==

If you know me and have something nice to say, please leave a comment here : 

* Daniel is an active member of the community, and espcially on reddit where he does an awesome job to make our "third party" developper community growing, community where he is himself part of, as a moderator, but also as a developper (he pushed 3 apps on the store if I am up to date). Happy to meet him everytimes online, sometimes even on our LoCo IRC channel, and maybe AFK ? I hope he comes see us in Paris (France) so I could share a beer with him! Everytimes I asked him some help on ubuntu (reddit css, sharing call for volonteer of our loco where we were in trouble to fill our team,…) he was there. That kind of behavior looks pretty ubuntu to me ;) <nowiki>[[~cm-t]]</nowiki>
* As an active participant in our official subreddit, /r/Ubuntu, Daniel helps keep the conversations active and respectful, while consistently providing assistance to others. He's also the creator of /r/UbuntuAppDev, a small but growing subreddit for our small but growing app developer community, which I very much appreciate. Reddit is a newer area of contribution for Ubuntu members, but it's quickly becoming a very important one, and Daniel's contributions in this space have been an incalculable benefit to the wider Ubuntu project. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:mhall119]]</nowiki>  * Daniel is great to work with. He was quick to jump into the project, noting small problems, joining UOS for planning and working on his ideas proactively, independently. He's easy to work with and great to have around. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:dholbach]]</nowiki>
