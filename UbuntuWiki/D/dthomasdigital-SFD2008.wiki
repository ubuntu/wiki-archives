September 20th 2008 marks the next Software Freedom Day and The New Mexico Ubuntu Loco plan to have a better year this year than in <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/dthomasdigital/SFD2007|2007]]</nowiki>. Now that the New Mexico Loco is an Official Team and we know to register our team early we will have plenty of Cd's to hand out along with other goodies.
