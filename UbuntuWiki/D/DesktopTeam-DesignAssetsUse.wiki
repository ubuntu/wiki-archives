__TOC__

The page lists the assets used in the Ubuntu Desktop image and their format at the time of Kinetic

== Those are expected to change every cycle ==

=== Wallpapers ===

default background image - png, 3840x2160 or 4096x2304 (? we had 4096 for a few cycles then 3840, unsure if one format is preferred)

the default wallpaper is colored and we include dark/dimmed/light variants

Vcs - https://code.launchpad.net/ubuntu-wallpapers

=== Installer ===

We use the mascot in 3 different shapes

* the mascot with no background and space around the image
https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-desktop-provision/blob/main/packages/ubuntu_bootstrap/assets/slides/1/mascot.svg

* the mascot with a colored background
https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-desktop-provision/blob/main/packages/ubuntu_provision/assets/images/mascot.svg

* the mascot with no background
https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-desktop-provision/blob/main/packages/ubuntu_provision/assets/images/mascot_no_background.svg

The SVG images should not use inline styles (use style: "presentation attribute" in the format settings)
due to https://github.com/dnfield/flutter_svg/issues/105

=== gnome-initial-setup ===

The welcome screen of the initial setup wizard uses a mascot logo, svg format, 560x560
