__TOC__

This is the first blueprint for the https://launchpad.net/doctemplate project. 

This project has two aspects, Project Code and LP:
* Project Code:
** Create template that enables one to easily add documentation to another package or as a standalone package (DONE)
** User can choose to write source in docbook article or docbook book (DONE)
** Full localization supported: localized strings and localized images (DONE)
** Make commands convert source to localized: html, pdf, docbook (DONE)
** Package installation supports installing localized docbook or html using omf files to register it in library for display in yelp
* LP:
** Easy (well-understood), two-way integration with LP translations (DONE)

LP Wish List items: 
* Project "Documentation" tab
* Set Documentation privileges (analogous to Translations privileges: Open, Structured, Restricted) 
* Assign project to Documentation Group (analogous to Translation Group)
* Translation page to support image localization (implies import and export from/to source branch)
* LP to provide xml transformation to localized version (html/docbook?) with auto-display in LP

=== Phase 1 ===

Phase 1 is focused on the Project Code and its integration with LP translations.

==== Goals ====

* Add build target that generated localized docbook in a directory structure (under build/) that is suitable for installation as yelp help
* Add packaging that installs the docbook/html/pdf output

==== Completed Goals ====

* Work through the LP Translation process for this project: 
** 'make update-po' to extract strings to po directories
** request bazaar import in LP project to update LP template
** translation in LP
** export to bzr branch and integration into bzr source 
* Add build target to convert it to localized html: this now works with two make commands: 
** 'make html-site LANG=<langcode>' generates a localized version of the article or book in build/html/<langcode>/
** 'make html LANG=<langcode>' generates a localized version of the article (book needs work) that is nicely formatted and css styled with a clickable TOC, next and previous buttons for article sect1 elements. This is in build/html-test/<langcode>/

=== Phase 2 ===
