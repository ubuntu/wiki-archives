Ubuntu-Secured-Remix is created to help any Ubuntu user, and any Windows/MacOS user willing to try Ubuntu.

Letting people install Ubuntu without loosing their MBR, and providing boot-related tools (Boot-Repair and OS-Uninstaller) until these 3 functionalities are included officially in Ubuntu.

== Goals ==

Road map: providing a new ISO release based on the last stable Ubuntu version, each time that a major stable version of Clean-Ubiquity or Boot-Repair is released.

== Collaboration Focuses ==

This distribution aims at working closely with Ubuntu to include the 3 tools (Clean-Ubiquity, Boot-Repair and OS-Uninstaller) in Ubuntu ISOs.
