// State transitions with Unparenthesised, Unannotated event descriptions are triggered upon that event.
// Parenthesised phrases indicate a predicate test, alternative transitions should be given for other cases.
// phrases annotated with a '+' or a '-' indicate a change of predicate state - some may not be given (usually where it is fairly obvious)
