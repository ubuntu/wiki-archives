== How to Triage ==
When triaging bugs in Plymouth, it's important to make sure that the bug describes a genuine bug in Plymouth. If a bug describes a problem that might not be related to Plymouth, the bug reporter should be asked to try reproducing the bug without Plymouth (as indicated in the Debugging procedure). When the bug can be reproduced without plymouth, the package should be changed for the appropriate one.<<BR>>
It's also important to make sure that the bug reporter gave sufficient information like described in the "How to file" section. When some information are missing, it's always a good idea to set the status of the bug to Incomplete, subscribe yourself to the bug report and to ask the reporter for the missing information.
