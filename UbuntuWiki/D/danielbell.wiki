=== About Me ===
I'm a computer science student living in Dumfries, Scotland. I've been interested in Linux for a number of years, beginning somewhere around 2004, but only begun using Ubuntu as my main Operating System in 2007. Since using Ubuntu (and listening to some great Linux/free software related podcasts), I've been advocating free software and Linux to my family, and close friends.
