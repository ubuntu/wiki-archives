__TOC__

Linux user since 1997. Ubuntu user since 4.10.

Great understanding of the structure and philosophy of a Linux distro. Enough Bash skill to get things done. No real programming since 1988.

Tangentially involved with LTSP and K12LTSP since the pre-1.0 days on both accounts.

Heavily involved with the Thailand FLOSS movement, localization, and LinuxTLE from 2001-2004. Offered a spot on the LinuxTLE development team (NECTEC) before the movement was killed. Curse MS and their back-room dealings!

Spends spare time writing blogs ( http://ibeentoubuntu.com ), howtos, and books about Ubuntu.

Slashdot membership under the same nick.
