=== Summary ===

Users should be able to disable or decline a components and there is currently no way to do this. Several other specifications slated for EdgyEft are suggesting software from components that have not been explicitly selected yet. Users should be able to not only decline to install this software but to select that they do not want to every have non-free software suggested again. While universe and multiverse are not enabled by default, they must be able to explictly ''disabled'' as well.
