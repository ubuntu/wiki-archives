** X Stabilisation:
*** Drive through nouveau DDX bugs; all are upstream or awaiting info from reporters
*** Use upstream-testing section from NouveauEvaluation to start a Nouveau troubleshooting page
*** Pull some safe, small fixes from nouveau kernel tree for some small bugs we've filed.  After testing the kernel, these will get sent to the kernel team.
*** Poke at Intel GPU hang list.  With Sarvatt's help, we're down from more than 50 to 24, and we've identified a kernel patch that got accidentally dropped from the -16 kernel that should fix a large class of these.
*** Start on a patch to make VESA bail when kms is active; if VESA tries to drive a kms screen it results in pretty “blooming” rather than a useful display.  Patch works, just requires some more autofoo & checks to ensure it's acceptable upstream.
** F-Spot
*** Fixed the obnoxious problem where editing would make photos with orientation information mysteriously rotate by 90 degrees.  As an added benefit, orientation information is now preserved when saving files.
*** Added the (hopefully!) final polish - handling when files appear in the directory f-spot's watching, and fixing the worst part of bug #175191 by preventing the incorrect timestamps being written to imported files.
*** Triaged some f-spot bugs while I was in the neighbourhood.
** gnome-keyring-sharp
*** The keyring daemon in 2.30 no longer exports a socket interface, and gnome-keyring-sharp is totally dependent on that socket interface.  <nowiki>[[https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/lucid/+source/gnome-keyring-sharp/+bug/536925|Bug 536925]]</nowiki> tracks this.
*** Poked at upstream, who are not particularly active.
*** There's a partial replacement by an upstream broken by the change on the bug, but that's unlikely to be acceptable to gnome-keyring-sharp upstream.
*** I'll keep prodding upstream & get an acceptable plan of attack
