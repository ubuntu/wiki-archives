== Weekly Summary ==

* cups-filters 1.0.22: The pdftopdf filter duplicated a lot of code of Poppler. It is now replaced by a QPDF-based one written as a Google Summer of Code project this year by Tobias Hoffmann who wrote already texttopdf and pdftoijs in the Google Summer of Code 2008 (tkamppeter).
* Progress on getting the remote-login feature landed: remote-login-service and thin-client-config-agent both hit the archive.  Patches to enable them are approved, but winding their way into the archive.
* Sync dnsmasq 2.63 (and update NM), for proper DBus DNS modifications support; dnsmasq introducing a way to specify a custom DBus name for the instance spawned by NetworkManager (cyphermox)
* Tweaked the accessibility indicator in ubiquity such that it appears for all startup conditions except for being run from the desktop. (TheMuso)
* GNOME a11y stack updates, 3.5.90. (TheMuso)
