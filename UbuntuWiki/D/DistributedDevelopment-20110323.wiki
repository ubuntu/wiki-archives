* slangasek has been doing lots of udd branches for multiarch and gobject-introspection was the only out-of-date one.  kudos to the bzr team!
* do you use udd for sru's?  if so, tell us what you did and how it went! slangasek: "I was surprised to see a UDD merge request the other week for -proposed [...] surprised because it worked, actually :)"

<barry> hi everybody and welcome to this week's udd meeting.  it's been a few
        weeks, how is everyone?
<poolie> good
<poolie> it feels like a long time
<barry> indeed

<poolie> thanks for chairing, barry  [17:02]
<barry> poolie: np!
<barry> hi jelmer, james_w.  anybody know if jam is around?
<james_w> I don't  [17:03]
<barry> shall we jump right in then?
<poolie> remember he's in europe now, so this is late at night for him
<poolie> like 11pm
<poolie> let's go
<barry> ah, right
<barry> [TOPIC] action items
<MootBot> New Topic:  action items
<barry>    * poolie to advertise udd projects to non-staff contributors
<barry> 
<jelmer> barry: jam was around an hour or so ago but mentioned he was heading
         out  [17:04]
<barry> jelmer: thanks
<poolie> i think done
<poolie> but if other people have good ideas for how to get more help on it i
         would welcome them  [17:05]
<poolie> or, they can just do it :)
<barry> poolie: cool.  related: is bzr participating in gsoc this year?
<poolie> no
<poolie> i don't think it's a good tradeoff on the whole
<barry> okay.  if there were interest, it could be done under the psf umbrella
                                                                        [17:06]
<barry>    * poolie to integrate jml's feedback into lep
<barry> 
<poolie> yes, done  [17:07]
<barry>    * poolie to meet with robbiew re lep
<barry> 
<poolie> not yet sorry
<poolie> carry it over
<barry> poolie: will do
<barry>    * jam to propose/report plan for quilt imports
<barry> 
<barry> i'm guessing that's to be carried over...
<poolie> there was some discussion about them probably needing to be imported
         to looms
<poolie> i'm not sure if jam's action is to do more than that
<barry> i'll send him an email to get his status  [17:10]
<poolie> ok, good
<barry>    * poolie talk to stakeholders about bfbip scheduling
<barry> 
<barry> poolie: remind me what bfbip means? ;)
<poolie> build from branch into primary
<poolie> and i have not done it yet  [17:11]
<barry> poolie: ah yes, of course, thanks
<poolie> :(
<poolie> but i will soon
<barry> cool
<barry>    * poolie to prepare udd sessions for uds-o
<barry> 
<poolie> !  [17:12]
<poolie> thanks for the reminder :)
<poolie> jelmer could i hand that off to you?
<barry> poolie: np.  i can help with that if you want
<poolie> or you, barry?  [17:13]
<jelmer> poolie: Yes, sure
<barry> jelmer: why don't you and i chat about it tomorrow?
<jelmer> barry: sure, sounds good
<barry> [ACTION] jelmer and barry to prepare udd sessions for uds-o  [17:14]
<MootBot> ACTION received:  jelmer and barry to prepare udd sessions for uds-o
<barry> that's it for action items

<barry> 
<barry> this is a hold over from our last meeting.  is there much more to say
        about it?
<poolie> the main thing with it now is to schedule a lp squad to actually do
         it  [17:15]
<poolie> the bzr team will help but i think (as does francis) it's going to
         have enough ongoing work it's better done in house by lp
<poolie> we're hopeful it will be the next feature scheduled and therefore be
         live by uds-o
<barry> poolie: sounds good.  i guess in that case we don't need to keep i on
        the udd agenda.  we can just get updates in the normal lp way or
        celebrate in aob when it lands  [17:16]
<poolie> good idea
<barry> [TOPIC]  * Package importer progress
<barry> 
<MootBot> New Topic:   * Package importer progress
<poolie> we've fixed some more bugs in the importer  [17:17]
<poolie> especially in scheduling
<poolie> and the number of failures has dipped .. a bit, but not dramatically
<barry> [LINK] http://package-import.ubuntu.com/status/
<MootBot> LINK received:  http://package-import.ubuntu.com/status/
<poolie> we got some bug reports about failures from ubuntu devs, which is a
         good sign  [17:18]
<slangasek> there seem to be new bugs always popping up that affect importing
            of precisely those branches I've touched before :-)
<poolie> and they're pulled into our team queues
<poolie> hm
<poolie> any particular packages or bugs people would like to nominate for
         attention?
<slangasek> gobject-introspection, for me
<james_w> that's the one that's waiting on a new bzr being rolled out to
          jubany  [17:19]
<james_w> #1 failure currently I think
<poolie> ah, ok  [17:20]
<poolie> [action] poolie to talk to mthaddon about getting new bzrs rolled out
         faster
<barry> james_w: is that: 80 packages failed with key
        AssertionError:<module>:main:find_unimported_versions:check
<poolie> i wonder if we can persuade them to deploy from a branch or something
<james_w> no, repository.user_url
<poolie> james_w do you have an opinion about that?
<james_w> not really
<barry> [ACTION] poolie to talk to mthaddon about getting new bzrs rolled out
        faster  [17:21]
<MootBot> ACTION received:  poolie to talk to mthaddon about getting new bzrs
          rolled out faster
<poolie> or maybe that's charlie
<james_w> so perhaps not #1, but #1 growing currently I think
* slangasek nods
<barry> i'll write it up as LOSA
<barry> any other feedback on the package importer?
<barry> [TOPIC]  * Bugs of interest:  [17:23]

<slangasek> I can say that I've been doing a lot of UDD branches over the past
            month for multiarch, and gobject-introspection was the only
            out-of-date branch I ran into - great job, guys :)
<barry> slangasek: how did you find out it was out of date?
<slangasek> barry: I'm in the habit of not trusting the branches at this point
            and always compare with the archive before I begin work :(  [17:24]
<barry> slangasek: yeah.  i see bug 609187 is in the queued column on kanban.
        that will help a lot i think  [17:25]
<ubottu> Launchpad bug 609187 in Ubuntu Distributed Development "bzr branch
         ubuntu:foo (a.k.a. lp:ubuntu/foo) should warn when foo is out of
         date" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/609187
* slangasek nods
<poolie> slangasek, thanks for that (both the positives and the specific
         negative)
<poolie> we're all finding the kanban pretty good btw
<poolie> it is encouraging some people (though not yet me ;-) to have smaller
         in progress queues  [17:26]
<barry> there are an impressive number of bugs in release and needs release.
        that's really awesome
<poolie> thanks
<poolie> it's been pretty good  [17:27]
<poolie> now everybody is back from vacation it should be better :)
<poolie> next item?
<barry> any other bugs to discuss?
<barry> if not...
<barry> [TOPIC] aob
<MootBot> New Topic:  aob
<james_w> none from me  [17:28]
<jelmer> I have a question. Now that we've done some FFe's and SRU's I was
         wondering if there was any guidance on how to do those with UDD?
<poolie> oh, we have four rotation candidates; i'm hoping at least one will
         proceed and start working from our may sprint  [17:29]
<jelmer> poolie: W00t. That'd be really nice.
<barry> \o/
<barry> jelmer: i've done one and iirc it wasn't much of a different workflow,
        after using a different url to get the code
<barry> not much of a data point, but i don't remember any udd-specific issues
<jelmer> barry: I guess that means there isn't a particular reason not to use
         UDD for SRU's at least then; I'll give it a shot next time one comes
         up.  [17:31]
<slangasek> I was surprised to see a UDD merge request the other week for
            -proposed
<jelmer> barry: thanks
<slangasek> surprised because it worked, actually :)
<barry> slangasek: yay! :)
<barry> not strictly udd, but: i want to give a shout out to jam.  python
        finally switched to mercurial, and there have been a huge number of
        messages on python-dev about it.  jam's messages always have a very
        high signal to noise ratio, and i really appreciate his expert
        involvement
<slangasek> barry: how is this supposed to work, in general?  does pushing to
            a new -proposed branch work yet?  [17:32]
<poolie> should be fun for them too
<poolie> thanks barry
<poolie> barry, prod him to ask you for a 360 review thing
<barry> oh, and it makes me *really* appreciate bzr, but more on that in a
        blog later :)
<barry> poolie: i will
<barry> slangasek: sadly it was a while ago and i don't remember exactly what
        i did  [17:33]
<slangasek> ok; just wondering if the one that worked worked only because
            there'd been a previous SRU for that package, so the branch was
            pre-populated  [17:34]
<barry> if/when folks do sru via udd, please do update the wiki with your
        experience
<barry> oh, which reminds me: the udd guide was integrated with the ubuntu
        packaging guide, so technically the wiki is out of date.  i will take
        an action item to see if dholbach has published it on the web
        somewhere and update the wiki documentation to point to the upg as the
        canonical information
<barry> [ACTION] barry to check with dholbach about publishing of upg with udd
        docs, and update the udd wiki pages  [17:36]
<MootBot> ACTION received:  barry to check with dholbach about publishing of
          upg with udd docs, and update the udd wiki pages
<barry> there was a little impedance mismatch there, but it was mostly a
        smooth integration, and we can clean things up as we go
<barry> anybody have anything else?  [17:37]
