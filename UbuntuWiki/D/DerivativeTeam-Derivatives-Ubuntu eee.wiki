== Introduction ==

'''This distro is inactive as of January 2020.'''

Ubuntu Eee is not only Ubuntu optimized for the Asus Eee PC. It's an operating system, using the Netbook Remix interface, which favors the best software available instead of open source alternatives (ie. Skype instead of Ekiga)

== Contact Information ==

* Web site: http://www.ubuntu-eee.com/
* Community news: http://www.jonramvi.com/category/ubuntueee/
* Launchpad project, including bug reports: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu-eee

== Audience ==

* Target audience: users of Asus Eee PCs who want to use a better Linux than the default Xandros distribution.
* Audience size: 300.000
* Estimated number of users (August 2008): 20.000

== Mission ==

== Goals ==

The distribution will be rebranded because Canonical holds the 'Ubuntu' trademark.

Also, the scope of the project is expending to include other popular netbooks, such as Aspire One, Classmate PC and others.
