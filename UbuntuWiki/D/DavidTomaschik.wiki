__TOC__

== About Me ==
I'm a college student studying Computer Science at Georgia State University.  I've been using Linux since around the time Slackware 3.0 came out, so it's been a little bit.  I've run Slackware, Debian, Gentoo, Fedora, and Ubuntu.  Ubuntu is by far my favorite for desktop use, and I've been using it exclusively for about two years.

== Projects ==
I'm the president of a student organization at GSU called <nowiki>[[http://cs.gsu.edu/~sos|Students for Open Source]]</nowiki>.  I'm heavily involved in local <nowiki>[[InstallFest|InstallFests]]</nowiki> and similar activities.
