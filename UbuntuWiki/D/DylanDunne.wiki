=== About Me ===
I'm Dylan Dunne.  I'm a Graphic/Web Designer/Windows Admin.  It's kind of an odd combination, but it affords me the opportunity to have a rediculious number of little electronic toys to play with.  I'm a double major in Marketing and Art, hence the graphic and web design, and the Windows Admin bit comes from work, just cause I have been doing it for a few years to put myself through college.

=== Things I Do ===
For the most part, I spend my day in my office posting updates to our company website, working on our company website, telling people to go to our company website, and generally preventing tue users from using their CD-trays as cup holders.  Oh, and I fix all the stuff that breaks.  My better half wonders why I come home and continue to work on websites and computers and what not.  Seems I have an addiction to learning new things, and spending hours in photoshop, and currently trying to figure out how in the hell to do a damn thing in GIMP.  Such is life.

Hopefully, I can contribute some of my skills to the distro that allowed me to play in the world of Linux again.  Without undue amounts of frustration.  The real thing I'm good at is raster drawings and photo manipulation, then comes web design (although there are far better ones than me out there), last but not least is my bumbling ability to create something that resembles a vector drawing.

=== Ubuntu as I see it ===
I've always loved the idea of Linux, just something different than Windows.  Always loved the idea, never managed to get it to work.  Ever.  Make no mistake, I know just about nothing about Linux, but I learn a little something new every time I reinstall because I broke it.  I do that bit often, chances are, I'm reinstalling it as you read this.  The one thing that made me stick around this time was that Ubuntu seems to work.  Out of the box, my video, sound, and mouse work.  It's amasing how vital the mouse is when you don't know all of the keyboard shortcuts for a new OS.

So, I keep a Ubuntu box in my living room, and I dual-boot on my laptop.  I get frustrated, or want to play a game, I switch.  But the more I use it, the more I love it.  It's not the customization that everyone screams about Linux all of the time, this is just a solid distro for a noob.  I could give this to my aunt and only make part of her head hurt.  Linux as a whole has come a very long way in the 2 years since my first __attempted__ install of insert -random-distro-that-was-flavor-of-the-month-for-my-linux-friend and subsiquent failures.  So, a random expriment with Ubuntu worked, and I have been playing with it for the last few months.
