__TOC__

Douglas was once a normal hamster. One evening, all that changed after he was bitten by a mindless hamster zombie. Ever since, all Douglas cares about are brains and avoiding having his head removed by hostile "livers". If you see Douglas on the street, give him a wide berth, as he will eat your brains.... Then he will laugh and laugh.

On the Ubuntu side of things, Douglas is much more laid back. He enjoys burning ISOs and handing them out to complete strangers, that is... when he is not craving brains. Douglas detests Vista and is not much fonder of the Mac, but he does what he can. Spreading open source at a rate only a tactical nuke could stop is Douglas's mission. Brains... mmmmmmmm!

PS Bill-
I want my licensing fee back. I will accept payment in the form of brains or brains. But not Steve Balmer's, his is not so fresh.
