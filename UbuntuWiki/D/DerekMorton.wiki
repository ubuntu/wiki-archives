I'm currently a student and ResNet Technician at the University of Arkansas Fayetteville studying Computer Science. I've been messing around with Linux since about 2001 or so, and discovered Ubuntu with version 5.10 (Breezy Badger). I enjoy using many different Operating Systems, and currently my systems consist of a Dell Latitude D420 with Vista Business, a MacBook Pro running OS X 10.5.1 (Leopard) and a Dell Dimension 3100 running Ubuntu 7.10. I've also have quite a few virtual machines between the three machines running XP, Solaris 10, and various other Linux distros.
