=== Who I am ===

I'm Dimitrios Ntoulas, member of the Ubuntu-gr (Greece) team. My academic background is in Computer Science. 
I am a network administrator and php developer in <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kozani|Kozani, at Macedonia, Greece]]</nowiki>.

== My Ubuntu story ==
I started using GNU Linux in 2003. In 2006 I made the switch to Ubuntu and never looked back!
I got involved with computers and Ubuntu while working with colleagues, trying to create a metropolitan network (MAN) at our city, <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kozani|Kozani]]</nowiki>. In our adventure I learned lots of things, including Linux networking, routing, wireless network setups and all sort of servers, such as Web, DNS, FTP, IRC, VoIP and game servers. Nowdays, I do all things Ubuntu, including the running of an open Internet lab running Ubuntu workstations.

=== My involvement ===

{*} System administrator at <nowiki>[[http://forum.ubuntu-gr.org/|Ubuntu-gr Forum]]</nowiki>. I recently fixed several bugs in the new template for the <nowiki>[[http://forum.ubuntu-gr.org/|Ubuntu-gr Forum]]</nowiki>. The forum is a high-capacity website, with more than 7600 members. We currently get 6 new members per day at our forum. My role is to make sure that the server runs smoothly, and I attend to any issues that may arise.

{*} I am co-administrator of Website and Forum for the <nowiki>[[http://www.klug.gr/|Kozani Linux User Group (KLUG)]]</nowiki>.

{*} As part of <nowiki>[[http://www.klug.gr/|Kozani Linux User Group (KLUG)]]</nowiki> we arranged with the Municipality of Kozani and now have a venue for our LUG, offering [[http://www.klug.gr/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=82&Itemid=36|free computer access with computers running Ubuntu Linux].

{*} I participate in bug reporting and translations on Launchpad. My main involvement on Launchpad is with the OpenERP project. I did debugging for OpenERP and worked with <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~logari81|logari81]]</nowiki> who did the coding. I am <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ntoulasd/+karma|at 700 karma]]</nowiki>.

{*} I help as a moderator at the <nowiki>[[http://forum.ubuntu-gr.org/|Ubuntu-gr Forum]]</nowiki> and also assist users with their questions on Linux. I have written <nowiki>[[http://forum.ubuntu-gr.org/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=5231|2275 posts (requires account to view]]</nowiki> at the <nowiki>[[http://forum.ubuntu-gr.org/|Ubuntu-gr Forum]]</nowiki>.

{{http://klug.gr/images/stories/klug-hq.jpg}} ''<nowiki>[[http://klug.gr/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=82&Itemid=36|Open Internet lab with Ubuntu workstations in Kozani]]</nowiki>''

{*} I run (as a member of KLUG) <nowiki>[[http://klug.gr/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=82&Itemid=36|an open Internet lab with Ubuntu workstations in Kozani]]</nowiki>. The lab space was offered by the Municipality of Kozani. It is open to everyone two days per week (Sunday, Wednesday). The lab has been in operation since September 2009.

{*} I helped organise the ''<nowiki>[[http://klug.gr/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=125:-7-&catid=1&Itemid=19
|7th Information Day on Computing Science]]</nowiki>'' at the Technical University of Western Macedonia as a member of the <nowiki>[[http://www.klug.gr/|Kozani Linux User Group (KLUG)]]</nowiki>. My responsibilities included the taking care of the three Ubuntu laptops (used in the presentations), distributing Ubuntu CDs (part of the Ubuntu-gr Loco CD allocation), arranging the catering of the event and booking the presentation hall.

{*} Participated at the <nowiki>[[http://osarena.net/2010/12/1%CE%BF-open-festival-%CF%83%CF%84%CE%B7-%CF%86%CE%BB%CF%8E%CF%81%CE%B9%CE%BD%CE%B1-%CE%B1%CE%BD%CF%84%CE%B1%CF%80%CF%8C%CE%BA%CF%81%CE%B9%CF%83%CE%B7.html|1st Open Festival]]</nowiki> event in <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florina|Florina]]</nowiki>, Macedonia, Greece. This was an open event and I manned the Free & Open Source stand, providing help on Ubuntu and distributing Ubuntu CDs.

{*} I created and manage <nowiki>[[http://troubleshooting.ubuntu-gr.org/|http://troubleshooting.ubuntu-gr.org]]</nowiki>, that helps new users find the solution to the most common issues they face with Ubuntu. The service uses <nowiki>[[http://ietherpad.com/0JfP1DdWXc|an open database of common issues]]</nowiki>. Troubleshooting.ubuntu-gr.org helps new users to identify quickly what they should do when facing a problem in Ubuntu. For example, for a sound card problem, the user would select ''Hardware issue'' » ''Problem with sound card'' » ''No sound at all'' » ''''SOLUTION: <nowiki>[[http://forum.ubuntu-gr.org/viewtopic.php?f=38&t=7867|Use the alsa-info.sh script to generate a sound card hardware report]]</nowiki>, and start a new thread at the <nowiki>[[http://forum.ubuntu-gr.org/viewforum.php?f=38|Sound section of the Ubuntu-gr forum]]</nowiki>.

One of his most prised gems is <nowiki>[[http://troubleshooting.ubuntu-gr.org/|troubleshooting.ubuntu-gr.org]]</nowiki>, which is a helpful tool for new users to troubleshoot their problem and figure out a solution. This tool also accepts easy addition of question-answer pairs -- people with none or minor coding background have contributed. <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~medigeek|Savvas Radevic]]</nowiki>

{*} It is difficult for me to count how many times Dimitrios helped me with issues I have had with ubuntu and many open source applications at my laptop and netbook, as he is offering his help and knowledge every day at the greek comunity of ubuntu.
I deeply respect people like Dimitrios, who help simple users like me to understand and learn about ubuntu and open source software generally, because if they were not there, there is a strong possibility that me and many of us would still be using windows. 
Dimitrios did a great job before he became an administrator at ubuntu.gr forum, and in my opinion since then he multiplied his efforts. 
Dimitrios thanks again and keep up with the good work. Th P
