__TOC__


At this point, no further fixes and updates to the desktop infrastructure components (libraries and key user interface stacks) should be made.   This is needed to give time to permit desktop applications to apply any necessary fixes on top of the infrastructure, and stabilize for the release. 

As with other freeze dates, exceptional circumstances may justify exemptions to the freeze, at the discretion of the release manager.
