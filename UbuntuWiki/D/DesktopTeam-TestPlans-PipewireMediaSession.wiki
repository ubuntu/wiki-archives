__TOC__

Since pipewire-media-session doesn't include a testsuite nor autopkgtests we will follow a manual testplan to verify updates.

Currently we are not using pipewire as a sound server so its use is limited to screen recording and sharing.

==== Setup ====

* Ensure a GNOME session, gnome-remote-desktop and pipewire-media-session are installed.
* Log into the GNOME session

==== Testing screen recording ====

* Hit Ctrl+Shift+Alt+R 
-> a red circle icon should be displayed in the top panel indicating recording has started

* Hit Ctrl+Shift+Alt+R again
-> the circle should be removed

The recording should be available in the standard xdg Video directory (~/Video in english)

==== Testing screen sharing ====

* Go to settings -> Sharing
* Enable sharing in the headbar if needed
* Click on Screen Sharing to enable it, check that remote login is enabled

On another machine

* Install a VNC client on another machine
* Try to connect to your linux desktop

-> The desktop should prompt to allow access, one accepted the VNC client should be able to see the session
