== Known Problems ==

* There is an issue where Ubuntu Studio will freeze at boot when run inside a virtual machine. However, since Ubuntu Studio is not designed to run in a virtual machine for performance reasons, we do not support this method of using Ubuntu Studio. If you wish to try Ubuntu Studio, burn it to a DVD or run it from a USB drive.

* A problem has been discovered related to <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xfce4-volumed/+bug/1291855|this bug in xfce4-volumed]]</nowiki> where a user's hardware volume keys will not respond after restarting !PulseAudio, such as when starting and stopping Jack. Only workaround is running the following in a terminal:

`killall xfce4-volumed && xfce4-volumed`

* Ubuntu Studio uses the same XFCE desktop environment as the official Xubuntu release, and thus, may be affected by some of the same issues.  This is also true of the core packages of the mainline Ubuntu release.  You can see their release notes <nowiki>[[https://wiki.xubuntu.org/releases/19.04/release-notes|here]]</nowiki> (Xubuntu) and <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DiscoDingo/ReleaseNotes|here]]</nowiki> (Ubuntu)

* Timidity (not installed by default) has been known to cause problems with audio configurations on Ubuntu and will lock-up ALSA.
