__TOC__

Below are the test cases that should be run when epiphany-browser is updated to a new major release in the development version of Ubuntu. These should also be run for any Stable Release Update for epiphany-browser.

=== Test Case ===
1.#0 Epiphany has build tests that will fail the build if they fail. Ensure the build is successful on all architectures.
# Install the Epiphany updates
# Visit https://ubuntu.com/ . Verify that the website loads and appears to work as expected.
# Visit https://jeremy.bicha.net/ In the address bar, there should be a 📖 icon. Click it to activate Reader Mode. The site should reload in a simplified view suitable for reading.
# From a terminal run
<code>sudo apt install gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad</code>
1.#5 Visit https://youtu.be/sgcVp5RHy4Q . The video and audio should play.

=== What Could Go Wrong ===
epiphany is not seeded in any Ubuntu desktop flavor so users are likely to have another web browser available if things were to go wrong and know how to install it.

As a component of GNOME core, there is a micro-release exception for epiphany-browser
