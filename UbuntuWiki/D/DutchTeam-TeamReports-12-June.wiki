=== Translations ===
At the moment it is calm. Precise has almost completely been translated (GUI and documentation). We're waiting with translating Quantal until String Freeze.
The English version of the Ubuntu Manual will be released shortly. In the beginning of July we can start with translating that.

=== Promotion ===
June 2nd there was a national release party in Beekbergen for the 12.04 release. A fotoalbum can be found here: http://www.ubuntuparty.nl/node/460

=== Foundation Support Ubuntu-NL ===
Many t-shirts have already been sold and flyers have been printed that can be requested from the website.
