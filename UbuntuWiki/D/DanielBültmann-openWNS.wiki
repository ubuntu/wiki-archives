__TOC__

The openWNS project is developing an open source system level simulation platform for performance evaluation and comparison of wireless and professional multi-cellular mobile communication systems. The simulation platform will offer close-to-emulation implementation of the respective protocol stack, including implementations of detailed interference modeling in reference scenarios, mobility models, traffic load generators, statistical evaluation methods and detailed channel models.
