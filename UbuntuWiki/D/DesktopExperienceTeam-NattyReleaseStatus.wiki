==== General status ====
* A few 0day-SRU elements still on our radar: https://launchpad.net/unity/+milestone/3.8.12
** One in particular requires the attention of the release team: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/compiz/+bug/737792/comments/18
** We are still investigating the design of a workaround

* All other bugs have been triaged and placed on either the regular SRU candidates list https://launchpad.net/unity/+milestone/3.8.14, or de-scoped for Natty.

* No pending FFE: thanks again for considering all of the last changes
