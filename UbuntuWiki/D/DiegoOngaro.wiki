== About ==
I started using gentoo in 2004 and moved over to Ubuntu just after the Warty release. I acquired a Fujitsu LifeBook P1510D in the summer of 2006 and moved over to Xubuntu during edgy's lifespan. I've worked with PHP/MySQL for a few years now, learned Python, and am currently picking up C. I started a Xfce panel plugin in C recently, which I hope to get included in feisty+1 (<nowiki>[[http://goodies.xfce.org/projects/panel-plugins/xfce4-places-plugin]]</nowiki>). I'm a student at Rice University (where I live for now), and I plan to graduate with a degree in Computer Science in 2009.
