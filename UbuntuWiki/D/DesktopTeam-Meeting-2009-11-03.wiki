==== Till Kamppeter (tkamppeter) ====

* IRC meeting with Ghostscript developer Ken Sharp on the #ghostscript channel on Freenode, to discuss the problem of evince's printing output not being accepted by PostScript printers (LP: #419143). He did not find anything breaking the specs, so that the problem can be a PS interpreter bug, but there are many interpreters having the problem (mostly printers of various brands and Adobe Distiller) and not having the problem (mostly software solutions, like Ghostscript).
* Reported nastygnome-settings-daemon bug letting the display of a notebook periodically turning on and off after once having closed the lid (LP: #471768).
* Answered and triaged printing-related bugs.
