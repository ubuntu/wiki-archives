== When LVM/RAID/etc. don't work on boot ==

Boot with `break=premount` on the kernel command line, remove both `quiet` and `splash` for sanity.

<pre>
(initramfs) rm scripts/init-premount/udev
(initramfs) echo "" > /proc/sys/kernel/hotplug
(initramfs) /sbin/udevd --verbose --suppress-syslog >/dev/udevd.log 2>&1 &
(initramfs) /sbin/udevtrigger
</pre>

Now press ^D and let the boot continue; once it has booted, please provide the `/dev/udevd.log` file.

'''NOTE: This does not appear to work on Lucid'''
