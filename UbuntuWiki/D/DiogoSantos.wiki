I've been early on involved with the Portuguese community, in several ways, my first attempts to participate date at least as early as of May 2005 (https://launchpad.net/~diogo-santos).

== Contributions ==

Most of my contributions have been in organizing or contributing to organizing within the Ubuntu Community, both in Portugal and Europe, but also in promoting Ubuntu, and establishing relations with other Free Software communities, organizing and helping the organization of small monthly events, and bigger events at national and European scale, and representing Ubuntu-pt and UBports.

I'm a long standing active member on the Portuguese LoCo and <nowiki>[[http://loco.ubuntu.com/teams/ubuntu-pt/|member of the Portuguese LoCo Council]]</nowiki>.

Over the time, I participated both on technical and the social events organized by the Ubuntu-pt Team, or where the team joined.

== Testimonials ==

I've known Diogo since the early days of the Ubuntu Phone project. He always helps point people in the right direction. Diogo is also always represented at Ubuntu community events such as UbuCon Europe. He even helped organize such an event. I had the pleasure of participating in several podcast episodes on various shows with Diogo where we talked about Ubuntu and the community. I am surprised that he is only now applying for Ubuntu Membership, he has been a valuable member of the Ubuntu community for many years. Make him a member :) --<nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:marius.quabeck]]</nowiki>

I only can say one thing: Diogo has to be an Ubuntu member! :) I'll not meet a guy with so much passion about Ubuntu and its community as Diogo has. He is always trying to help, he is always involved everywhere. Then, I wouldn't say +1 for his application, I would say +1000! -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:costales]]</nowiki>

In a scale from 1 to 10 Diogo is an 11 on the Ubuntu passion level! He is in constant evangelization of everyone around him, always in the right word/advice. I share with him some projects like the Podcast Ubuntu Portugal, that he challenge me to do with him and until now is being quite a ride... Thanks for everything, bro!-- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:tcarrondo]]</nowiki>

Diogo is so passionate for Ubuntu and privacy, that it is not somewhat surprising to know the number of projects he is involved and the amount of things we deals with regularly. Diogo has been a key stone in the Portuguese Loco, helping to spread Ubuntu, despite living abroad. Furthermore, he has played a key role developing Ubuntu Europa, a federation to help organize european LoCos. He connects often with third-party associations to help organize and defend what he thinks are the best interests of all open source communities, Ubuntu included and being a priority that he tries connection too often. For that alone, he is more than deserving of his Ubuntu Membership. It has been a pleasure to coordinate the efforts of the Portuguese LoCo and I know we will be working together on many ends.
-- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:gsilvapt]]</nowiki>

Diogo not only promotes and understands Ubuntu, but he lives Ubuntu. He is a self-motivated advocate who dedicates his time to improve the whole community. From hosting audiocasts to running meetups, Diogo loves getting together with people and sharing Ubuntu. He has be instrumental in supporting UBports and keeping the Ubuntu Touch project alive. I look forward to working with him more in the community. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:joe]]</nowiki>

Diogo Constantino must be the most passionate member of the European Ubuntu community I know. His work both for the Ubuntu Europe Federation and the UBports community is amazing and invaluable. Additionally to the unmatched dedication that makes his contribution so valuable, Diogo has an excellent network of contacts in the industry, which helped UBports develop many new relationships. I 100 % support Diogos application (frankly, i am suprised he is not a member already!). -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:neothethird]]</nowiki>

Diogo is one of those rare persons who are just amazing in everything they put their mind to.  From his dedicated work with the Portuguese !LoCo, to the astonishing number of podcasts and in-person meetups, no one could imagine that he might work harder to advance Ubuntu advocacy.  Except that he is such an important part of the Ubuntu Europe Federation and the UBports project, too.  With all of that hard work, he is also an incredibly warm, friendly person.  There are a lot of people who really embody the spirit of Ubuntu, and as one of them, Diogo is a true inspiration to anyone who hopes to do the same.  -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:nhaines]]</nowiki>

I've meet Diogo in different Ubuntu & FLOSS events in Europe and also on many online networks (podcast, chats, etc), and he is always making something about/for Ubuntu and its community. He is a strong and enthusiast advocator of the Ubuntu project & its community in Europe, and having his Ubuntu membership would be simply a normal thing regarding his past, present, and future contributions. Looking forward to share a drink with him at next Ubuntu Party in Paris December 2018 ! -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:cm-t]]</nowiki>

Diogo is a force of nature for the Ubuntu community. I thoroughly enjoy working with him as we create the messaging to keep users informed about Ubuntu Touch. He's always willing to help and doesn't pass up an opportunity to represent Ubuntu at a community event. If he says he's going to do something, it gets done right. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:universalsuperbox]]</nowiki> 
I have known Diogo since 2008 through Ubuntu-pt meetings in Lisbon and I consider him to be a valuable member to grow the local and European Ubuntu community. He is a great supporter of Free Software and Digital Rights and an active member of the Ubuntu-pt Community Council, always ready to support and develop the Community's initiatives. It has all the merit to be an Ubuntu Member. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:jaimepereira]]</nowiki>
