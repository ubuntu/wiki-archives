=== About Me ===

I'm a 37 year old married father of two lively boys living in Surrey in the <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK|UK]]</nowiki>. My background isn't in IT - I'm actually a GP (medical doctor) by day. I first got the IT bug when a undergraduate doing a thesis and rather enjoyed messing around with PC's. I spent many years on MacOS, though also messing around with linux since 2000 (and getting into a bit of bother when I installed redhat ?5 on a hospital PC!). I finally moved everything at home to ubuntu in 2007. I run the practice website from an ubuntu VPS - http://www.langleymedicalpractice.co.uk. Sadly there is little evidence of ubuntu within the NHS or UK healthcare, but who knows how the future will pan out. I suggest OSS and ubuntu where possible - to me the merits are a 'no-brainer'

=== Things I do for Ubuntu ===

==== Community ====

* Started a project to evaluate distributed backup solutions for <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UKTeam/Projects/DistributedBackup]]</nowiki>

==== Development ====

* A django based project for community anticoagulation monitoring, which has recently morphed into a system for diabetes monitoring and may well morph into something bigger yet.

==== Support ====

* When I can I answer support questions (and ask many more!) in #ubuntu-uk

 
=== External Stuff ===

* I'm on a couple of medical IT committees and am trying to introduce the notion of open source software

=== Future Work ===

* Open to suggestions!
* I'm watching the recent changed in NHS IT with interest (as of 9/8/10). The Microsoft tie-in has gone, leaving and area that floss can move into.
