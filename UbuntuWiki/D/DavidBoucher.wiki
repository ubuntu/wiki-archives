Email: 
I'm an open source developer very interested in computer algebra.
During my free time, I work essentially on Numexp.

I have taught mathematics for 8 years, but I am not motivated for this task now. I really like mathematics and programming, and I prefer to combine those two disciplines.

So, I'm looking for a new job. :-)
