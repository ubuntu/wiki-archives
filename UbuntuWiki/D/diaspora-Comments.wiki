__TOC__

Describe what you'd like to see as part of the DIASPORA* on Ubuntu spec. Please be as specific as possible.

Thanks!

---------------

-In the area where Gwibber and Empathy and all that stuff is, a notification area for Diaspora which is permanently logged in (like how Gwibber works)

-A package in the Ubuntu Software center for downloading and quickly installing Diaspora onto any Ubuntu-Ready device (ie. a Shiva plug)for the purpose of making pods proliferate

-A way for Gwibber to post Diaspora updates and receive notifications (possibly eliminating the need to do the first suggestion above)
