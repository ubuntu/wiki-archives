==== Evan Dandrea (evand) ====

* Merged the Mythbuntu changes to Ubiquity into trunk.
* ubuntu-without-restricted:
** Investigated areas where preseeding apt-setup/restricted would conflict with the .disk contents, discussed with Colin.
** Tested restricted-free installs.  They worked fine except for installing restricted-manager, which pitti fixed by pushing it into restricted.
* Reviewed the MOTU and cdbs documentation.  Started re-packaging ushare for universe.
* Ubiquity bug triaging.

==== Fabio Di Nitto (fabbione) ====

* LDOM integration in userland. As of wed night we should have all bits and pieces in place. We need to wait a few more days to get some minor kernel bug fixes before we can pull it in the kernel support.
* Hacked LDOM 1.0 (Solaris 10) init script to cope with their broken vds implementation while waiting for the real fix. This workaround will allow us to work with linux guests without too much manual hackery.
* Prepared ubuntu-gutsy-ldom.git tree on kernel.org with ubuntu changes. (configs and d-i bits)
* Done a bunch of merges and specifically lvm2 was important to get the bug fix from upstream to work with quorum disk devices. The latter still need proper testing (clvmd).
* Had friday off.

==== Ian Jackson (iwj) ====

automated-testing-deployment:
  I have made a working Xen setup again, using etch and a kernel from backports.  With this I was able to test and debug the new privilege separation and related features for autopkgtest, and I've passed this over to the sysadmins for deployment.

winmodems:
  Acquired a USB modem for testing, to try to find out what was commonly available.  Unfortunately it seems to be a Conexant-based device - ie supported only via the payware drivers from Linuxant. This one of only two USB dialup modems sold by my usual online suppliers, and the one which seems most common.

  I tested the sl-modem-daemon detection and configuration in gutsy daily, using the HP laptop provided via Matthew Garrett some months ago.  I've written a wiki page aimed at naive users, which unfortunately paints a rather difficult picture:
    https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SupportedDialupModems
  I think this ought to replace the rather complex and out-of-date
    https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DialupModemHowto

Spec review, planning and scheduling, including some incidental research.

Spec status:

* crash-reporting: all basic building blocks are together now, currently discussing the handling of the "black hole" email addresses on launchpad@.
* restricted-manager-improvements: no change since last week.

Other stuff done that week that might be of interest:
* changed langpack-o-matic to work with a PPA, removed a lot of old code cruft from it, and set up some tools on drescher for syncing them; once the PPA buildd settled down (sorry for DoSing it with the initial bootstrap) and packages have been tested, I'll switch the gutsy updates to automatic daily uploading.
* Set up http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-archive/NBS/ (updated twice a day) to help devs who help us with transitions (most notably StevenK :-) )

==== Søren Hansen (shawarma) ====

* EBox packaging (ftw!)
* Server sprint discussions and things
* Bug triaging

==== Till Kamppeter (tkamppeter) ====

* Made some thoughts about Ubuntu printer driver package auto-generated from distro-independent driver packages from OpenPrinting and discussed them with Martin Pitt on IRC. Main problem is that distro-independent driver packages install into /opt and a Ubuntu package must be made in a way that it does not install anything in /opt.
* Investigated Linux support by Xerox, see bugs
** https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cupsys/+bug/102389
** https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cupsys/+bug/110242
  Contacted Xerox about the problems, no answer yet. Tested Xerox driver packages: Closed source, do not work with Ubuntu, not redistributable. Only thing which we could do: Make printer setup tools clearly tell when they did not find a driver or PPD.
* Investigated fixed upstream bugs of ESP Ghostscript to make sure that the merged Ghostscript (which we will ship) gets all fixes and does not cause regression bugs in the distro.
* Answered bug reports.

==== Tim Gardner (rtg) ====

General:
* July 4 holiday

Kernel:
* Edgy l-r-m build problems on PPC
