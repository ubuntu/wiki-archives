=== draft/braindump ===

==== General process ====

* <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-distributed-devel/2010-January/000373.html|scottk's post on current problems]]</nowiki>

==== merging in bzr ====
* conflicts when merging debian/changelog (<nowiki>[[https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/bzr-builddeb/+bug/516060|bug 516060]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/bzr-builddeb/+bug/516056]]</nowiki>)

==== general bzr workflow ====
* bzr commit should default or provide a template that does something similar to debcommit (or suggest using debcommit?)
* obvious way to diff is against the remote branch, which is slow <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-distributed-devel/2010-January/000373.html|1]]</nowiki>

==== bzr builddeb ====

* inconsistent exposure of -S vs other flags <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-distributed-devel/2010-January/000373.html|1]]</nowiki>
* needs dput, mark-uploaded and push vs just one <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-distributed-devel/2010-January/000373.html|1]]</nowiki>

==== foreign branch support ====
* git submodule support is commonly requested
* general robustness of bzr-git

==== launchpad ui ====

* not clear how to add missing registry data, eg missing upstream links?

==== soyuz ====
* needs more buildds, or better use of the existing ones, for daily builds to be useful
