* Approved: access-gdm, braille-support, color-filters, common-at-conf, orca-laptop-support
* Drafting: multilingual-speech -- this will be taken forward by Gilles Casse from Oralux. I've also created orca-espeak as a prerequisite to this. 
feisty-speakup -- Depends on involvement from the speakup community. The next week or so will tell.
* Abandoned: atspi-testing-by-default -- seb128 had issues with this and I see his point.

Done:
* lots of package merges
* spec reviews, discussions, and approvals; my own (assignee/drafter) feisty specs are all approved; I approved most of the specs I'm approver for, except:
** simple-x-mode-selection: still in drafting, pinged rodarvus yesterday
** scalable-installation-testing: was approved this morning with our original design; mdz had a different idea which got discussed shortly this morning, but which requires more intrusive changes in ubiquity, the db design, and other components, so I set it back to discussion for now
** ltsp-local-apps: utterly complex and a quick discussion with cjwatson revealed that this needs much more thought (this one is not marked for feisty)
* cleanup-audio-jumble: tested pulseaudio and attempted to create the mentioned (in spec) patch to not hog the audio device; this failed due to the principal design of pulse; upstream works on a cleaner and more generic solution, but this will not be ready for feisty; since I do not want to break compatibility with commercial OSS apps and the multiuser case
, I did not continue working on this for now
* zero-configuration-networking: 
** did the required changes to base-files, avahi-autoipd, avahi, libnss-mdns, and ifupdown, so that the stuff works OOTB now when using dhclient
** filed bug for zeroconf package removal  
** still missing: fix network-manager to not clobber the avahi-autoipd address (so that .local name resolution works with n-m), teach network-admin about the new ifupdown method (not that urgent, though, most people will not use the new /e/n/interfaces method and just rely on n-m or dhclient), and seed avahi-autoipd to ubuntu-desktop (after herd freeze)
* apport-improvements: got apport bits in for intercepting Python crashes, discussed a battle plan for Mono with slomo
* two OpenWeek talks
* started discussion and coding for automated package tests (mainly to improve QA of security updates so far, but this topic seems to grow and grow)

Todo:
* finish zero-configuration-networking implementation
* fix feisty's and edgy's gnome-system-tools authentication problem
* change dapper's and edgy's ~/.xsession-errors rotation handling to new plan
* dive into bug triage
* look into other specs as time permits

Done:
* Taught two classes for UbuntuOpenWeek
* Verified many StableReleaseUpdates
* Bug triage
* Decided on two interns for the Montreal office
* scalable-installation-testing spec is drafted
To do:
* Interview more interns on Friday
* Start getting thin clients for interns
* Write documentation on Wiki about Ubuntu QA and TestPlans/TestCases.
Blocked:
* synaptic SRU is waiting in the edgy-proposed NEW queue
Specs:
* bug-reporting-tool (Approved)
* scalable-installation-testing (Discussion)
** We should probably implement some form of scalable-installation-testing, even if it isn't sufficiently general.  The Testing/Current wiki page must die.
