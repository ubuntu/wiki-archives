''This specification will eventually describe how <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debconf_(software_package)|debconf]]</nowiki> should be presented graphically.''

… If an installation script requests to overwrite a configuration file, an alert should appear:
  <nowiki>[[File:transaction-config-conflict-installation.jpg]]</nowiki><<BR>>

The alert should have the primary text ‘The installer for “{<nowiki>[[#software-title|title]]</nowiki>}” wants to change a configuration file already on this computer.”, and the secondary text “If you do not know why this file is there already, it is usually safest to allow the change.” followed by “File: {path}” in a paragraph by itself. It should have buttons “Keep Existing Version” and “Allow Change”, where “Allow Change” is the default.
