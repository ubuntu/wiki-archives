== What is Digital Freedom? ==
Digital freedom is freedom of information, which includes content, software, formats, codecs and containers, protocols, and even hardware, but with a strong focus on digital information and technology. It is very similar and closely related to the Free Software and Free Culture movements. The Free software movement's philosophy is broad enough for it to be called the digital freedom movement.
