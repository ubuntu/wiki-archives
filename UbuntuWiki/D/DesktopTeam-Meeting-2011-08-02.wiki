__TOC__

== Actions from previous meeting ==

== Actions from this meeting ==

== Weekly Summary ==

* Ghostscript: Worked out important printing-related bugs with the upstram developers, especially segmentations and wrong color output on HP printers (TillKamppeter)

* Updated Gutenprint to have "-dNOINTERPOLATE" in the Ghostscript command line (TillKamppeter)

* Updated HPLIP to version 3.11.7 (TillKamppeter)

* Updated system-config-printer to version 1.3.5. Now it contains a D-Bus service through which all its algorithmic parts (driver selection, correct listing of detected printers, ...) can be used by other printer setup tools like the tool of GNOME 3, g-c-c upstream is already making use of this, see https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=654742 (TillKamppeter)

* OneConf 0.2 is released. Compatible with current gtk2 software-center, removing desktopcouch and compatible with (to enter beta staging server next week) ubuntu-webcatalog. (didrocks)
* Removed the recommends between cifsutils and winbind, won 4 MB on the CD (didrocks)

=== Partner update ===
==== DX ====
* Nothing before a3
==== UbuntuOne ====
* shim is being worked on, planned to land in time for feature freeze
* sounds like they will drop support for rhythmbox in oneiric to preventing support libubuntuone for both gtk2 and gtk3

=== Unity ===

** Unity:
*** we get an unity release yesterday late (libunity-misc/nux/unity), giving the needed infrastructure for next week release for latest incoming features.
*** This version broughts some nice contributors fixes as well: https://launchpad.net/unity/4.0/4.6.0
*** There is still known regression or mouse and keyboard events. Not planned to be fixed until feature freeze though
*** A last minute upload in nux, making it crashing on some intel card is in progress. Next respin will take it (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nux/+bug/819739)
    
** Compiz:
*** No tested compiz release went out from dx, so no gsettings backend ready for now. We reverted the unity dialog reverting light-themes, removing the unitydialogs plugin and reverted from unity-window-decorator to gtk-window-decorator to workaround the slowliness some people were getting. All of that for alpha3 being more testable. Hoping next release after alpha3 to bring the gsettings backend by default.
    
** Unity-2d:
*** New unity-2d release, this version brings gtk2 indicator free deps \o/
*** new release of some qt components, like libqtdee, lilbqtbamf
*** A lot of bug have been fixed: https://launchpad.net/unity-2d/+milestone/3.8.12. This version now shares more code for the panel with the unity code. unity-2d is now depending on nux and unity. Consequently, as there is no ABI garantee, each release will need a nux -> deps on libunitycore rebuild -> deps on unity-2d rebuild.
*** the new unity release consequently asked for a new unity-2d one (https://launchpad.net/unity-2d/+milestone/3.8.14) for the new libunitycore ABI break, and a last minute alpha3 fix: https://launchpad.net/unity-2d/+milestone/3.8.14.1
    

=== Software Center ===
* Software Center version 4.1.11 released, includes:
** New top-rated panels for category views (Games, Internet, etc.), many thanks to Aaron Peachey
** Continued progress in the GTK3 version
** Many bug fixes
* This week:
** More 5.0 features for the default branch, GTK3 work continues
