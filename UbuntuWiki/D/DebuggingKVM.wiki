__TOC__


== Bug importance ==

* critical: eats your data
* high: crashes the host
* medium: crashes the guest (and most other "normal" bugs)
* low: doesn't crash host or guest, but has undesirable, clearly buggy behavior, or if it does cause crashes, can be worked around
* wishlist: feature requests, everything else lower priority

== Debugging procedure ==

* If it is easily reproducible, try building from upstream git and reproducing.  Then bisect
** [ todo - give example ]
* Try a newer kernel if available
* If KSM is enabled, see whether disabling it helps

== Reporting a bug ==

All reports should contain the following information.  Please be sure to '''attach''' these files to the bug report.

* uname -a > uname-a.log
* cat /proc/version_signature > proc_version_signature.log
* dmesg > dmesg.log
* cat /proc/cpuinfo > proc_cpuinfo.log
* If your linux guest can't boot, start kvm with <code> -serial file:kvm_guest_debug.log </code>.
   <pre>
 kvm linux_guest.img -serial file:kvm_guset_debug.log 
</pre>
   And edit grub to boot kernel with <code> earlycon=ttyS0 console=ttyS0 </code>
   <pre>
 kernel /vmlinuz root=/dev/sda1 earlycon=ttyS0 console=ttyS0 
</pre>
