There are a number of arguments that you can pass on the kernel command line that affect the way the Desktop CD and installer function.

* Section B.2.2 of the installer-guide discusses preseeding the answers to debconf questions as kernel command line options.  The format for this is component/question=answer.
* '''url=http://my.server.com/preseed.cfg''' or '''file=/path/to/preseed.cfg''': Grab and use a preseed file from the specified location.
