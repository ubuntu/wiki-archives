=== Agenda ===

* Disable apt+http URLs since PPAs (primary use case) are not signed?
* buildds don't have debconf accept set for Sun's java licence, no response from infinity

=== Disable apt+http URLs ===

apturl: the Spec (and the current implementation) have an apt+http://foo.bar?package=baz syntax that allows adding new
repositories if the repository is signed with a key we have in the apt keyring.

The use-case for this was PPA.  It turns out that PPAs are not signed currently and that it is uncertain when they will and with what key.  I would like to disable this feature in apturl therefore for gutsy and come back to it when the situation with the PPAs is more clear. Any objections?

Decision was to disable and revisit the implications at UDS.

ACTION: iwj to start conversation on ubuntu-devel about automatic software installation etc.

=== buildds don't have debconf accept set ===

This was a case where an RT ticket had been filed, and assigned to a member of the IS team who hadn't done it and was not responding to pings.

In this situation, it's more than fine to escalate back to their team leader.  If that doesn't get you anywhere, let your team leader (ie. me) know and I'll ensure somebody looks at it.

ACTION: Riddell to talk to elmo
