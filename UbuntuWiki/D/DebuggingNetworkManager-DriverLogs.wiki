== Getting debugging-level driver logs ==

/!\ Might be slightly out of date. This section needs review. /!\

When a bug appears to be driver related or you are asked by a bug triager to submit a driver enabled
log, you need to enable driver logging right before you start to capture your testcase. How to do that depends
on the driver you use and whether it has been with compiled with debug support.

=== IPW (2100,2200, 3945) ===
==== Logging ====
<pre>
 modprobe ipw{2100,2200,3945} debug=65535

 echo 65535 > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/ipw{2100,2200,3945}/debug_level
</pre>
