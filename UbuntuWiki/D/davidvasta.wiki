== About Me ==

My Name is David Vasta. I live in Charlotte, NC. I am a 20 year IT Professional with a very wide background in IT. Over the past 20 years I have been a System i (AS/400, iSeries, i5/OS) Admin, Lotus Admin with some Lotus Development, UNIX & Linux Admin and Windows Admin. I really have enjoyed using Linux and MacOSX over the past 10 years and would like to help out more with the Loco and Documentation Teams.

My launchpad page is <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~david-vasta]]</nowiki> and my website and blog are at <nowiki>[[http:www.davidandkelly.com]]</nowiki>.

== My interest in Ubuntu ==

I have always wanted to be a developer and create things that people use, but I know now C++ and coding are not something I can do with ease. I enjoy learning about the OS and it's underpinnings, then sharing that with others, which is mainly documentation. I am looking for a mentor on the documentation team and would love some day to work for Ubuntu. That would be dreamy.

== Contact ==

== Other Interest Outside of Ubuntu ==

* Photography - I am a pretty good photographer and enjoy taking pictures. People & Places
* Karting - Love to kart. Not karts by the beach but full on racing karts. 
* If you kart then let me know. I would love to build a timing system that is open for Linux. Like I said I am no good at C++ or development but would give it a try if I could. I am still trying and still have time to figure it all out.
