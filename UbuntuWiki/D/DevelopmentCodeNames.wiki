__TOC__

Ubuntu is known for having the funkiest release code names around.  From time to time users suggest potential names, so if you have a magical idea, please add it to the table at the bottom of this page.

To determine the code name of the system you are running, 
open a terminal and use the command 
<pre>
    lsb_release -a
</pre>

=== Release Naming Scheme ===

The official name of an Ubuntu release is "Ubuntu X.YY" with X representing the year (minus 2000) and YY representing the month of eventual release within in that year. Ubuntu's first release, made in 2004 October (10th month) was Ubuntu 4.10.  Since the actual release date is not known until ''it's ready'' and humans tend to prefer names rather than numbers, a set of codenames are used by developers and testers during the buildup to a release:

The development codename of a release takes the form "Adjective Animal". So for example: Warty Warthog (Ubuntu 4.10), Hoary Hedgehog (Ubuntu 5.04), Breezy Badger (Ubuntu 5.10), are the first three releases of Ubuntu. In general, people refer to the release using the adjective, like "warty" or "breezy".  The names live on in one hidden location---the archive release name in `/etc/apt/sources.list` and seen on the download mirror network.

=== History ===

MarkShuttleworth said the following with regard to where the naming scheme originally came from:

  '''So, what's with the "Funky Fairy" naming system?'''

  Many sensible people have wondered why we chose this naming scheme. It came about as a joke on a ferry between Circular Quay and somewhere else, in Sydney, Australia:

    <pre>
lifeless: how long before we make a first release?
sabdfl: it would need to be punchy. six months max.
lifeless: six months! thats not a lot of time for polish.
sabdfl: so we'll have to nickname it the warty warthog release.</pre>

  And voila, the name stuck. The first mailing list for the Ubuntu team was called "warthogs", and we used to hang out on `#warthogs` on `irc.freenode.net`. For subsequent releases we wanted to stick with the "hog" names, so we had Hoary Hedgehog, and Grumpy Groundhog. But "Grumpy" just didn't sound right, for a release that was looking really good, and had fantastic community participation. So we looked around and came up with "Breezy Badger". We will still use "Grumpy Groundhog", but those plans are still a surprise to be announced...

  For those of you who think the chosen names could be improved, you might be relieved to know that the "Breezy Badger" was originally going to be the "Bendy Badger" (I still think that rocked). There were others...

  For all of our sanity we are going to try to keep these names alphabetical after Breezy. We might skip a few letters, and we'll have to wrap eventually. But the naming convention is here for a while longer, at least. The possibilities are endless. Gregarious Gnu? Antsy Aardvark? Phlegmatic Pheasant? You send 'em, we'll consider 'em.

1. `lifeless` is Robert Collins.  `sabdfl` is Mark Shuttleworth.

=== Code Name Suggestions ===

If you think of a really good one future name, save it here rather than keeping it hidden away inside your brain and you never know, you may even see a release named after allowing you to feel happy inside knowing that you've contributed in a very special and unique way to an Ubuntu release!

This is not a competition, but a way for people to work together!

'''11.10''' ('''<nowiki>[[#O]]</nowiki>''')

'''This name is already decided, so ideas added here will be ignored.'''

11.10: '''Orderly Owl''' - Orderly: since this is one of, if not, the most organized & easy to use piece of software out there.  Owl: because they are nocturnal (like most of us) and sit patiently, wait and watch the chaos from up above; waiting for the right moment to strike and be seen!

11.10: '''Oneiric Ocelot'''. '''An OS that we all dream of... think ahead to when you are referencing the release in forums and such, e.g., like "Lucid" and "Karmic" ... with that criterion, "Oneiric" ~sounds~ the best, and Ocelot sounds more fluid than Octopus and kind of continues the Lynx theme ... and it is probably easier to be more esoteric on a non-LTS release ... of course, if Gnome is not restored in place of Unity, this is all moot ....''':)

11.10 '''Ozric Ocelot''' ...  if anyone knows what Ozric actually means ... it sounds cool, but definitely a made-up word ...

11.10: '''Oneiric Octopus'''

11.10: '''Open-Source Operating System''' Not exactly following the naming convention, but still cool!

11.10: '''Optimistic Osprey'''

11.10: '''Oscillating Owl'''. Sounds good?

Also, '''Observing Opossum'''

If 11.10 has a major artwork update, '''Opulent Oryx''' (or some other animal) would seem fitting.

11.10: '''Opulent Ocelot'''

11.10: '''Opulent Okapi'''

11.10: '''Ogling Owl'''

11.10: '''Ostentacious (or Outgoing) Orangutan'''

11.10: '''Ominous Orca'''

11.10: '''Ornery Otter'''

11.10: '''Outrageous or Outlandish Ocelot'''

11.10: '''Odd Ostrich'''

11.10: '''Obnoxious Orangutan'''. First seen in <nowiki>[[http://thedailywtf.com/Articles/The-Receptionist-Test.aspx|thedailywtf.com]]</nowiki>.

11.10: '''Osculating Octopus'''. While not a simple adjective, it still serves as one.

11.10: '''Opulent Ox'''. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ox

11.10: '''Ostentatious Opossum'''.  Opossums have a remarkably robust immune system: like ubuntu (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opossum)

11.10: '''Omnipotent Orca'''.

11.10: '''Orgiastic Ocelot'''. ;-)  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocelot

11.10: '''Optimistic Olingo'''. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olingo

11.10: '''Organic Octopus''' - Go cephalopods!

11.10: '''Odd Owl''' tells me what I want to do.

11.10: '''Ornery Oni'''. Make it Oni-ni-Kanabo! <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oni_(folklore)]]</nowiki>

11.10: '''Orthogenic Owl'''. There aren't many good, short O-adjectives, are there? "Orthogenic", according to my dictionary, means "promotes proper development". In this context, of course, "proper" means open-sourced. ;)

11.10: '''Orgasmic Okapi'''. Orgasmic because, well, you know why.  Okapi because it is a truly extraordinary, beautiful animal that has only recently been discovered by humans and 11.10 could be the release that lets '''everyone''' know about Ubuntu :D

11.10: '''Obsequious Otter''' does what you tell it to.  Also, floats on its back and cracks things open with a rock balanced on its belly.  Beat that M$.

11.10: '''Opulent Otter'''.  We all now how opulent otters are with their rich, playful nature.

11.10: '''Obnoxious Ox''', '''Ominous Ox''', '''Obedient Ox'''.

11.10: '''Obscure Ostrich'''.

11.10: '''Obnoxious Octopus'''.

11.10: '''Obscure Owl'''.

11.10: '''Obedient Orc'''.

11.10: '''Omnific Octopus'''.

11.10: '''Organic Oyster'''.  Tasty, fat, sea-flavored non-OGM Oyster.

For release 11.10 I suggest '''Oblivious Okapi'''

11.10: '''Ostentatious Owl'''.

11.10: '''Organized Orca'''. Ubuntu wants to be organized. Furthermore, a quote from <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orca|Wikipedia about orcas]]</nowiki>: "Killer whales are highly social; some populations are composed of matrilineal family groups which are the most stable of any animal species."

11.10: '''Orgasmic Octopus'''.

11.10: '''Oatiest Ogre'''. Maybe with a nice Shrek themed wallpaper for the kids? ;-)

11.10: '''Omniscient Owl'''

11.10: '''Omnipotent Owl'''

11.10: '''Ornery Ox'''

11.10: '''Orthogonal Ocelot'''

11.10: '''Opulent Ogre'''

11.10: '''Oblique Ocelot'''

11.10: '''Open Oyster'''

11.10: '''Orthodox Otter'''

11.10: '''Omnipresent Ossifrage'''.  One tough bird.  Its name literally means <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossifrage|"bone breaker"]]</nowiki>.

11.10: '''Omniscient Ossifrage'''.

11.10: '''Ornery Oryx'''

11.10: '''Omnipotent Octopus'''. All those omnipotents and all those octopi and nobody thought to put them together?

11.10: '''Ornery Orca'''.

'''12.04''' ('''<nowiki>[[#P]]</nowiki>''')

'''This name is already decided, so ideas added here will be ignored.'''

12.04 '''Pudgy Penguin''' Penguin because Tux is. Pudgy because Tux is.

12.04 '''Pangrammatic Penguin''' Pangrammatic coming from pangram, a sentence containing all the letters in the alphabet. What are we doing here again? !!! And the penguin? Well, that rounds it up. Ubuntu: it's the linux-penguin going through all the letters of the alphabet!

12.04 '''People's Penguin''' It's gotta' be Penguin. A nod to Linus & Tux & all that has sprung forth.
      Persistent...
      Plucky...
      Penultimate...
      Popular...
      Prodigious...
      Portentous...

12.04 '''Ponty Python''' be a legend!

12.04 '''Punctilious Possum''' Attention to detail

12.04 '''Pretty Penguin'''.

12.04 '''Psychedelic Penguin'''.

12.04 '''Priapic Porcupine'''.

12.04 '''Placid Pigeon'''. Pigeons are not easily disturbed. Look at where they live.

12.04 '''Persistent Penguin'''. Ubuntu has Persistently worked towards making the Linux-Penguin available and more accessible to a wider audience. Persistent Progression of the Penguin could be symbolic for this release.

12.04 '''Pleasant Pheasant'''. Because It is a pleasure using Ubuntu and Beautiful at the same time.

12.04 '''Psychedelic Peacock'''.The peacock is an interesting creature. I take a little offense that the male is the beauty, and the peafowl (female) is very plain and without the bright .Psychedelic states are an array of experiences elicited by various techniques.

12.04 '''Perpetual Puma'''. "Perpetual" seems to stay with the slightly mystical theme going from "Lucid" to "Natty" and "Oneiric." 12.04 is also an LTS release, and Perpetual sounds perfect for that. The Puma is a good representation of what we know Ubuntu to be. Sleek, elegant, and beautiful; while light on its feet and fast.

12.04 '''Perceptive Polecat'''. I like this animal because it represents in its qualities the same qualities that have the ubuntu family! particularly perceptive in this case, a quality that allows us to anticipate the circumstances and the best way to overcome the difficulties, this quality has always been important in the development of ubuntu, and essential for community members around the world. More information in this <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Polecat|page]]</nowiki> and pictures <nowiki>[[http://www.google.com/search?q=polecat&hl=es&prmd=ivns&source=lnms&tbm=isch&ei=XqTOTZm8DMnV0QHSz8TuDQ&sa=X&oi=mode_link&ct=mode&cd=2&ved=0CBgQ_AUoAQ&biw=1143&bih=640|here]]</nowiki>.

12.04 '''Pragmatic Peafowl'''. Getting things done, elegantly. After some daydreaming Ubuntu must get its feet back on the ground for an LTS release. A dapper drake, a hardy heron and a lucid lynx share style and solidity. They should really be followed by a pragmatic <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peafowl|peafowl]]</nowiki>.

12.04 '''Polished Pronghorn'''. <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronghorn|As fast as light]]</nowiki>, but it doesn't have a hair out of place. Note: I agree that choosing Python or (worst) Penguin would be bad. Every single Linux distro could have those names. A name should somehow identify the peculiarities of Ubuntu, it shouldn't make Ubuntu appear like.. a Penguin, just like every other Linux out there. Not good.

12.04 '''Placid Platypus''' - I think Placid is the winning adjective this round because Ubuntu should be equated with serenity for its relative ease of use. Among the animal suggestions, I fear that A) penguin is just to panderingly obvious, and I agree with some who opine that Ubuntu is more about the platform as whole, B ) parrot just brings up the accusations of Canonical "aping Apple" and C) python is almost too obvious like penguin for the programming language association. I think Platypus is nice for two reasons, firstly just the general WTF-ness of the platypus as a strange seeming amalgamation of genera (which makes it, to me, a "fun" animal choice), and secondly, when combined with placid, it is simply alliterative. Plus, just imagine the t-shirt in the Canonical store!

12.04: '''Placid Penguin''' - Placid: Having a calm appearance or nature, undisturbed by disorder, satisfied, complacent.  Similar to Lucid in definition and spelling, the perfect follow up from one LTS to another.  Penguin: Nuff said...

12.04: '''Placid Python''' - Placid: Having a calm appearance or nature, undisturbed by disorder, satisfied, complacent.  Similar to Lucid in definition and spelling, the perfect follow up from one LTS to another.  Python: Quoted from a post below "Python is a powerful and open-source programming language.  It is the core language of Ubuntu".  It also has a nice ring to it.

12.04: '''Placid Panda''' - Placid is definitely corresponding to the spirit of a LTS release. Python and Penguin are too obvious and geeky choices. Panda is a freaking cool animal and is also quite placid, a perfect match. Moreover «Placid Panda», ''sounds'' good, just try to say it out loud...

12.04: '''Poetic Panda''' - Less LTS-ish adjective, but more "dreamy", which might also be quite nice.

12.04: '''Passionate Panda''' - Passionate like the Ubuntu Community.

12.04: '''Polished Penguin''' - This name came up when I was browsing a list archive from 2005 at lists.ubuntu.com - have a look at https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2005-September/010893.html

12.04: '''Pretty Pig''' it's funny :) This name remember "Patty the Pretty Pig", it's a good idea for a 'pink' ubuntu release to meet more female users... :P and an opportunity for male users to approach more ubuntu girls! ;) ihihihi

Regardless of the name, a 'pink' release to promote breast cancer awareness would be a good thing. It'd need to be a .10 version (October release, for Breast Cancer Awareness Month).

I like "'''Perverse Penguin'''"... Imagine the logo :)

Also, "Prodigious Penguin" or "Pragmatic Penguin"

I like '''Phobic Phoenix''' for 12.04. Or, as a friend suggested when I pumped him for good PH adjectives, "acidic".

I personally like '''Phasic Phoenix''', referring to the constant change and development, and no doubt 12.04 will be a major step forward, so it's the bird rising from the ashes! I think it has quite a nice ring to it too :)

I like "Peaceful Parrot" One definition of peace is (freedom of the mind from annoyance, distraction, anxiety, an obsession, etc.; tranquillity; serenity.) that describes Ubuntu well....Not annoying, but beatifully colored

I like "Phoenix", but "Phobic" sounds rather negative. What about '''Persistent Phoenix''' or '''Prestigious Phoenix'''?

How about '''Pyrophobic Phoenix''' I like the idiosyncrasy?

Perhaps '''Pensive Phoenix''' or '''Prodigious Phoenix'''? I like how it sounds.

'''Pyrotechnic Phoenix''' seems better to me than '''pyrophobic''', but I do like '''pensive''' fairly well too.

For that matter, how about '''Pyrophoric Phoenix'''? Or even '''Pyroclastic'''?

'''Playful Porpoise''' :) is about the best imagery I've thought up, I believe.

But then '''Precocious Porpoise''' is also good -- practically perfect if think of a young porpoise.

Particularly promising though is '''Pouncing Puma''' -- ready to pounce on the competing OS's... or even just pouncing all over people's problems.

Obviously '''Perpetual Puma''' would be a nice choice for an LTS release. Or '''Perpetual Phoenix''' since they are born over and over again from their own ashes and therefore keep on living.

Who wouldn't like a '''Playful Platypus''' though? :) Of course, Practical Platypus or even Pragmatic Platypus might be okay too.

Playful Panda

Prancing Pony

Precocious Panda

'''Prominent Peacock'''

'''Polar Penguin'''

Perenneal Peacock

'''Perky Piwakawaka''' (<nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piwakawaka|NZ bird]]</nowiki>, common name is Fantail)

'''Purple Panther''' (Because 'Pink' would be too obvious)

'''Pink Puffin'''
'''Precious Puffin''': Precious is short enought and it perfectly fits the spirit of previous releases. And honestly, Puffin is just an amazing animal name ;)

'''Poetic Pony''', or indeed anything at all ending in '''Pony''', I have been promised, would result in my girlfriend defaulting to Ubuntu rather than only occasionally going in when her Windows install breaks down.

Therefore: '''Poetic Pony''', which I feel emphasises the ''poetic grace'' we are coming to expect from increasingly slick Ubuntu releases, or perhaps '''Pensive Pony''' to show that Ubuntu is careful to think, to deliberate, to give matters suitable consideration?

'''Precocious Pony''' too has, I think, an extremely good ring to it, and would lend itself well to our habit of doing new things.

I like "'''Pink Panther'''"... just for fun :-)

'''Precarious Pangolin''':  Ubuntu releases have tended to focus on more unusual animals or names for animals.  They raise questions like, "What is an Eft?" or "Where do badgers even live?" and thus can raise awareness of the animal and its circumstances.  I, for one, would like more people to know about pangolins because they're interesting and well-defended creatures.  Much like Linux as a desktop operating system.  The adjective can probably take many angles, but the way I see it, it's an X.04 release and it's also reflective of the continued state of the Linux desktop.  It's taken a long time to get this far, but it's never bad to have a reminder that resting on our laurels is at our own peril.

I like the animal but I would say '''Playful Pangolin'''. Precarious seems too much like "instable" :)

12.04: '''Powerful Penguin'''

12.04: '''Poetic Penguin''' - It's time for Tux to come back!

12:04: Me gustaría un nombre en Español para demostrar la apertura del sistema a todas las comunidades, me parece muy al estilo de la filosofía Ubuntu. Ej: Poderoso Pingüino.

12.04: '''Pretty Panda''', the <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panda|Giant Panda]]</nowiki> is a conservation reliant endangered species. Giant Panda black and white coat color, black eye, very cute! In 1961, the <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Fund_for_Nature|World Wide Fund for Nature]]</nowiki> (WWF) select Giant Panda for their logo. Now, Giant Panda has become the most important symbol of wildlife conservation. Sorry, bad English.
<nowiki>[[http://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-hk/%E5%A4%A7%E7%86%8A%E7%8C%AB|大熊貓]]</nowiki>（別名：貓熊）是瀕危野生動物。大熊貓黑白相間的毛色、黑色的大眼圈，非常可愛！早在1961年<nowiki>[[http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%96%E7%95%8C%E8%87%AA%E7%84%B6%E5%9F%BA%E9%87%91%E4%BC%9A|世界自然基金會]]</nowiki>（WWF）成立時就選擇了大熊貓作為其標志。現在，大熊貓已經成為了全世界物種保護的象征。

12.04: '''Powerful Python''' Python是一种强大，开源的编程语言，Ubuntu 使用它作为核心编程语言。/Python is a powerful and open-source programming language. It is the core language of Ubuntu.

12.04: '''Perilous Pica'''

12.04: '''Personal Pixie'''

12.04: '''''Proud Puma''''' - Proud LTS

12.04: '''Punctual Penguin''', 'cause Ubuntu is never slow and is therefore never late :)

12.04: '''Pulchritudinous Penguin''', since 12.04 will be a beautiful thing. And, for a change, some people will be asking what the adjective means, instead of what the animal is. "Pulchritudinous" is a bit of a mouthful for daily use, so I expect if adopted, the daily name will be either (radically) "Penguin" or (contractively) "Pulk." Suggested by Deref at <nowiki>[[http://thepaperpusher.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=29058|PPMB]]</nowiki>.

12.04:  '''Purple People Eater''', Just because it would be funny!!

12.04:  '''Pyro Phoenix''', Does not exactly ring but still cool.

12.04:  '''Precocious Platypus''', '''precocious''' - achieving mental aptitude far ahead of normal developmental schedules; '''platypus''' - a mammal that lays eggs.  Nuff said.

12.04:  '''Peckish Piranha''' - Razor teeth and pools of developers ready to taste the blood in the water.

12.04:  '''Prickly Pheatherbrain Protozoa''', the protozoa is '''prickly''' because of the feathers on its brain.<nowiki>[[http://bobobo.wikia.com/wiki/C-Block|(Bo-Bobo C-Block Featherbrain Protozoa)]]</nowiki>.

12.04:  '''Peppy Penguin''', gotta invoke Tux, and having the OS be 'peppy' has a nice ring and feel to it.

12.04:  '''Pacific Pegasus''', Pegasus is very cool name, and Pacific is a place for Pegasus. (from:raihan maulana)

12.04: '''Pink Panther'''

12.04: '''Powerful Puma''' - cute LTS name

12.04: '''Pinky Peacock''', because I like peacocks pink comb.

12.04: '''Pyromaniac Python'''

12.04: '''Perfect Penguin'''

12.04: '''Paranoid Pelican''' "Insecure Windows and Mac users can scoop up a copy."

12.04: '''Persuasive Pig''' "You can't say no."

12.04: '''Phat Possum''' "I don't compete with anyone"

12.04: '''Prissy Possum''' "Looks are deceiving"

12.04: '''Persnickety Peacock''' "I'm better then you :P"

12.04: '''Perverted Peacock''' "Just for laughs :D"

12.04: '''Perky Python''' "One that stands Firm /  bright / Standing upright"

12.04: '''Persevering Parrot''' This release is probably going to be an LTS release, it's going to have a long life. Parrots usually live for many years and are long term commitments when kept as pets. They are also colorful and fun when well kept, therefore can be related to some kind of cosmetic/functional uplift. Persevering as the commitment to making a great OS. Possibly a reference to the progress in solving Ubuntu bug <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/1|#1]]</nowiki>.

12.04: '''Pacifist Penguin''' Well, when the code name starts with a "p", why should you use anything else than a penguin? Now we have the chance to use a penguin!

12.04: '''Plucky Pidgeon''' Taken from the following <nowiki>[[http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/idea/27405/|idea]]</nowiki>

12.04: '''Pellucid Puffin''' Would look good as a simplistic logo. Also, puffins are awesome and need to be spread around the world!

12.04: '''Placid Pichi''' - I agree for the reasons stated above in Placid Platypus and Placid Python for why I think Placid is the adjective to go with. As for my choice in animal, I think that Python and Penguin are too obvious (as stated above). I like Pichi for the way Placid Pichi sounds, and when I think of an armadillo I think of a content, calm, but tough animal, and this is like the image I get for Ubuntu.

12.04: '''Prolific Penguin''' - As Ubuntu is gaining more and more market share, Prolific seems like a sensible adjective. Penguin..... well come on, you can't miss this opportunity can you?!

12.04: '''Pragmatic Puffin''' - Pragmatic: meaning guided by practical experience and observation rather than theory. Puffin: a most interesting, mystical and majestic species of seabirds.

12.04: '''Pristine Pelican''' - Pristine is clean, raw, and uncorrupted.  Designed with your own beliefs in mind despite what others may say. Pelican, because it sounds cool and is a bird. The first two LTS releases were birds, though Lynx was not. I think it would be cool if all the next LTS's where birds.

12.04: '''Pristine Penguin''' -Doesn't soar as high and freely as the Pelican, but it stands mightier than any bird and has the freedom to rapidly swim throughout the oceans of this world.

12.04: '''Paradisaic Pegasus''' WIN! :)

12.04: '''Prudent Pangolin''' Prudent means ''Acting with or showing care and thought for the future''. This is probably not a bad description since for instance it's the first major Gnome upgrade ever in Ubuntu + I'm sure there are other good reasons for this. Pangolin is the animal of choice for several reasons. 1. It is secure because of its scaly armour. 2. It loves eating bugs (well ants but you get it...) 3. It's an endangered species and while the opposite might be said of Ubuntu it would be nice to give this special animal some recognition.

12.04: '''Paramount Panda''' - Just sounds and feels right to me.

12.04: '''Pumped Penguin''' - Fired up and ready.

12.04: '''Prudent Pronghorn''' - Showing care and thought for the future as it's a LTS release.

12.04: '''Progressive Pangolin''' - The scales slowly tip toward a more reasonable standard for those genuinely interested in this unique animal.

12.04: '''Prudent Phoenix''' - Exactly what Ubuntu is: Powerful, and always looking to the future! It also sounds good, too.

12.04: '''Phantom Phooka''' From Celtic mythology, a shape-shifter that takes you on a wild ride.

12.04: '''Pernicious Potoroo''' of course.

12.04: '''Pure Panda''' - An innocent skillful animal.

12.04: '''Paramount Penguin''' - After all our (Emperor) Penguin should stand powerful and stable like a mountain for this LTS release and in future.

12.04: '''Persevering Pegasus''' - Because I like the Pegasus. It is awesome. :) Also, the Persevering makes sense because of the LTS release.

12.04: '''Perished Parrot''' - Remember Monty Python?

12.04: '''Pining Parrot''' - Remember Monty Python???

12.04: '''Prostrate Parrot''' - Another Monty Python name.

12.04: '''Powerful Pudu''' - The Pudú is a little deer <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pudú]]</nowiki>. The name points to most OS's today needs one or two DVD's to install a bit of applications (no office or media apps). Ubuntu on a simple USB Pendrive or CD, put much more functions than other. Ubuntu can be friendly to the home user or have quality tools for the professional server environment.

12.04: '''Persnickety Penguin''' - You'd be fussy too if you were always in formal wear.

12.04: '''Perspicacious Penguin''' - Listen, this is a Linux distro...you have to respect the penguin when his turn comes up.

12.04: '''Pensive Penguin''' - The ''penguin'' is a must for this release. And because Ubuntu shows its way into the future of Linux with this Unity-LTS release the attribute ''pensive'' is most fitting.

12.04: '''Prestigious Penguin''' -  Ubuntu is a well-respected company. Also, this release must have ''penguin'' in it.

12.04: '''Plucky Penguin''' - Because that's what it is.

12.04: '''Prudent Pegasus''' - It can go on earth or in the sky as he chooses.

12.04: '''Punny Parakeet''' - Puts the fun back into computing.

12.04 '''Proud Penguin''' - Obvious, memorable, and to-the-point.

12.04 '''Peachy Penguin''' - It's gotta be a penguin, and I think ''Peachy'' has a great ring as a stand-alone adjective and ''Peachy Penguin'' conjures up a cool, uniquely coloured flightless bird who's doing just "peachy"! :)

12.04 '''Ponderous Panda''' - A well built, powerful, slow moving, playful yet thoughtful animal.

12.04 '''Posh Penguin''' - It's an LTS release, so i think "posh" is the thing we want to symbolize for a broader usage. I thought about a panther instead of a penguin, but I think it's to Mac'ish, and we are indeed "Penguin". Penguin with a butterfly is what pops in my head.

Uintathere is an extinct animal and UBuntu is not extinct, Umbrian you can't find it on internet and Ubuntu you can, Urukai the same story as Umbrian, urubu doesn't work as a team, An Urchin doesn't represent the beast that Ubuntu is.

'''This name has already been decided "Vivid Vervet" so any further suggestions will be ignored '''
 
15.04: '''Venomous Viper''' a powerful beast out to destroy competition.

'''"veracious veery"''' (the meaning of veracious is speaking or representing the truth, and the veery is a songbird.)

'''Victorious Viper''' Ubuntu 15.04: After the Trusty Tahr and his stability, passed the magnificent Utopia and the winning Unicorn action, Ubuntu reach his most belowed result... Victory! All of us have won! Mark, the community, Canonical and the entire Linux World... Many people switch to Open Source and here we are all so happy! So from there I decide Victorious adjective; for the animal, Honestly there aren't so much animals to choose starting with V... I opted for Viper as an astute intelligent and sneaky animal that as Ubuntu in the near future will slowly but inexorably destroy Windows market share (bug n.1) and turn people to freedom and right to choose whatever they want, whatever they search for and all of what they want to do without limits restrinctions or something else... This is my propost.. Please read it as accurately as I wrote this piece of text :)

15.04: '''Victorious vulture''' - As it's suitable/stable to run with any old computer, it will never get old. it's fast and free good looking clean OS with power and open source on it side to work together to make it more powerful and better each year as a team.

15.04: '''Victorious Velociraptor''' - We're going to eat somebody's lunch...

15.04: '''Versatile Viper''' - Running on multiple platforms

'''15.10''' ('''<nowiki>[[#W]]</nowiki>''')

Suggestion for 15.10 : '''Whacky Worm'''.

'''Wonderful Wallaroo''' - A moderate sized kangaroo, sort of in between a Kangaroo and a Wallaby

'''Witty Woodpecker'''
'''Witty Wildebeest''' :)

'''Wascally Wabbit'''

'''Wild Wolf''' - Generic but beast.

'''Warlike Wolf''' - A variant of the above, but conveys more emotion. Ubuntu is a wolf ready to go to war against the closed-source evils of Microsoft and Apple, and to free the human from non-free software.

'''Wandering Wolverine''' - A powerful animal that does it's own thing aside from big corporations.

'''Wily Wombat'''

'''Wandering Wombat'''

'''Warm Wombat'''

'''Wondrous Wombat'''

'''Wiggly Wallaby'''

'''Wet Whale'''

15.10: '''Wily Wolf'''

15.10  '''Wily Weasel'''

15.10: '''Willful Wallaroo'''

'''Weird Wapiti'''

'''Wry Weka'''

'''Wise Walrus''' - A strong, social animal that lives in large communities. <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walrus|Wiki]]</nowiki>

'''Witty Walrus''' - Above suggestion, modified a bit. <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walrus|Wiki]]</nowiki>

'''Wise Whippet''' - As it will always be fast and learning new things

15.10: '''Wicked Werewolf''' - Probably there is a more suitable adjective, but I'd love to have an Ubuntu t-shirt with a werewolf :)

Ubuntu 15.10: '''Witty Wolverine''' 

'''16.04''' ('''<nowiki>[[#X]]</nowiki>''')

'''<nowiki>[[http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/date/2015/10|Officially]]</nowiki> known as: Xenial Xerus'''

  What fortunate timing that our next LTS should be X, because “xenial” means “friendly relations between hosts and guests”, and given all the amazing work going into LXD and KVM for Ubuntu OpenStack, and beyond that the interoperability of Ubuntu OpenStack with hypervisors of all sorts, it seems like a perfect fit.<<BR>>
  And Xerus, the African ground squirrels, are among the most social animals in my home country. They thrive in the desert, they live in small, agile, social groups that get along unusually well with their neighbours (for most mammals, neighbours are a source of bloody competition, for Xerus, hey, collaboration is cool). They are fast, feisty, friendly and known for their enormous… courage. That sounds just about right. With great… courage… comes great opportunity!

'''Xerophile Xeromys''' - see <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerophile|Xerophile]]</nowiki> <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xeromys|Xeromys]]</nowiki> on  Wikipedia. Xeromys usually live in <nowiki>[[http://www.qm.qld.gov.au/microsites/mangrove/watermouse.asp|swamps and mangrove forests]]</nowiki>. Xerophile is someone who prefers it dry (xerophobe sounds lame).

'''Xeric Xiphias''' - a swordfish adapted to a dry environment... A bit of an oxymoron perhaps, but no more than "military intelligence" :)

'''Xenial Xantus''' - a hospitable hummingbird... Picture of a Xantus's hummingbird would look great as a release logo.

'''Xenial Xebu'''

'''Xenial Xema'''

'''Xenial Xenops'''

'''Xintillating Xenomorph'''

'''Xenophobic Xenopus'''

'''Xenophilic Xerus''' - Attraction to things foreign and different, and still has squirrely cuteness...

'''Xtatic Xiphophorus'''

'''Xenophobic Xenomorph'''

16.04: '''Xanthous Xoni'''

16.04: '''Xanthic Xoloitzcuintle''' The Mexican Hairless Dog is a rare, hairless breed of dog whose size varies greatly. It is also known as Xoloitzcuintle (Spanish pronunciation: [ʃoloit͡sˈkwint͡ɬe]; English: /ʃoʊlɔɪtsˈkwiːntli/ SHOH-loyts-KWEENT-lee).

'''xenodochial xenops'''

'''Xenodochial Xanthidae'''

16.04: '''Xenodochial Xoloitzcuintli''' Mexican hairless dog breed that is friendly to strangers.  According to  http://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/xoloitzuintli though they are not friendly to strangers, hehehehe.

'''16.10''' ('''<nowiki>[[#Y]]</nowiki>''')

'''<nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakkity_Yak|Yakkity Yak]]</nowiki>''' is fun... but maybe Nickelodeon would sue us...

'''Yellow Yeti'''

'''Yummy Yak'''

'''Yumping Yemeni'''

'''Yoyoing Yak'''

'''Yodeling Yapok''' The Water Opossum (Chironectes minimus), also locally known as the Yapok, is a marsupial of the family Didelphidae.

'''Yawning Yak'''

'''Yappy Yorkie'''

'''Yowling Yak'''

'''Yucky Yak'''

'''Yelding Yulong'''

'''17.04''' ('''<nowiki>[[#Z]]</nowiki>''')

And what will be then after 17.04 codenamed with Zarthy Zorthy :D

If Xenial Xebu doesn't do for 16.04, then maybe '''Zealous Zebu''' might pass for 17.04

'''Zippy Zorro'''

'''Zany Zebra'''

'''Zooming Zebra'''

17.04: '''Zesty Zander'''

17.04: '''Zig-zagged Zanzibar'''

17.04: '''Zestful Zebra'''

17.04: '''Zesty Zorilla''' Ubuntu project is located in Vancouver.  Skunks are rampant in Vancouver and area.  Zorrilla (skunk) thus makes a very interesting homage to our unofficial mascot of Vancouver, and also marks the end of the first alphabet.  Zany reminds me of the film animation industry in Vancouver.  Zippy is much like their behavior. Oh, please, make my day!

17.04: '''Zealous Zorse'''  Hybrids should not go unloved.  And open source advocates can be zealous.

'''17.10''' ('''<nowiki>[[#A]]</nowiki>''')

Maybe we could start doubling the initial like in '''Aalenian Aal''' or '''Aalenian Aardvark'''

We could restart using flowers or plants instead of animals.
e. g. '''Apologetic Anemone'''

For release 17.10 i suggest '''Ambitious Aye Aye'''

Maybe: Awesome <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alebrije|Alebrije]]</nowiki>?

I like the idea of using plants next. Or perhaps rocks/minerals.

On that note, I'd like to suggest Anomalous <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysoberyl#Alexandrite|Alexandrite]]</nowiki>.

Well, how about using planets? Because Ubuntu GNU/Linux are out of this world!

As per my idea, I suggest "Artsy Ables" or anything that has a planet in it.

17.10: '''Alternative Argania'''

17.10: '''Artsy Ara Ararauna'''

'''18.04''' ('''<nowiki>[[#B]]</nowiki>''')

Potentially 18.04: '''Ballsy Baboon''' Or... '''Busy Beaver''' (A <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_beaver|Busy Beaver]]</nowiki> means a Turing machine that attains the maximum "operational busyness").

'''Big Bat''' 

'''18.10''' ('''<nowiki>[[#C]]</nowiki>''')

'''Chocolate Chapulín'''.  Or... '''''Chapulín Colorado''''' (''no contaban con mi astucia'')...
'''Chillin Chinchilla'''... '''Cheerful Cheetah'''.
'''Cheesy Chicken '''

'''Calculating Camel'''
'''Cheesy Cobra'''

'''Cheshire Cat'''

'''Cool Crocodile''' As Ubuntu is cool ( with a nice GUI etc. ) but it's robust ( like a crocodile )

'''Canonical Cardinal'''

'''19.04''' ('''<nowiki>[[#D]]</nowiki>''')

19.04: '''Drowsy Donkey'''

'''Defiant Deer'''

19.04: '''Dreamy Dragon''' Ubuntu is simple and cool and yet powerful amd robust. (References from the dragon "Night Fury" from the movie "How to Train Your Dragon")

19.04: '''Didactic Dove''' Might be a tad haughty, but odds are the average person won't know what didactic means so they will have to look it up, which means we will have taught them about morals :)

'''19.10''' ('''<nowiki>[[#E]]</nowiki>''')

We'll have to skip non-vowels to do this: '''Eely Eel''' is kinda exaggerated :)

19.10: '''Electric Eagle'''

19.10: '''Elegant Elk'''

19.10: '''Elite Elk'''

19.10: '''Epic Eel'''

'''20.04''' ('''<nowiki>[[#F]]</nowiki>''')

20.04: '''Fair Fox'''

20.04: '''Foxy Fox'''

20.04: '''Flying Fly'''

20.04: '''Flamboyant Falcon'''

20.04: '''Полный Песец''' (rus. Polny Pesec, Fat arcticFox) Just for fun! This word combination is widely known in former (ex)USSR. Hey, you`ve just named an whole OS after zulu word ;) Please don`t blame me for this little cyrillic piece.

20.04: '''Fiery Falcon''' - Ubuntu gets faster...

20.04: '''Funky Ferret'''

20.04: '''Feral Ferret'''

20.04: '''Flippant Flounder'''

20.04: '''Flashy Flicker'''

20.04: '''Fancy Flamingo''' - Ubuntu in its true colors

20.04: '''Furious Fennec'''

20.04: '''Fluffy Fennec'''

20.04: '''Fervent Finch''' - Ubuntu is only getting faster and lighter, and is built by individuals fervent about Ubuntu.

----

''and somehow this part of the page went unused for a couple of years so 20.10, 21.04, 21.10, 22.04, and 22.10 got left out...''

----

'''23.04''' ('''<nowiki>[[#L]]</nowiki>''')

23.04: '''Limpid Llama''' - Limpid means "clear, clean, unclouded, easily understandable", which is what we want all Ubuntu releases to be.
