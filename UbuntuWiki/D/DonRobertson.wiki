Greetings all,

I am setting up a Cambodian LoCo Team for Ubuntu, so there should me more here soon. Also see the CambodiaTeam page.

I am still figuring out what needs to be done, and getting the mailing lists, forums, home pages and so forth set up.

If you would like to join or contact me, please use <nowiki>[[http://rn.saksaathmey.net/contact|this]]</nowiki> form.

Ubuntu is available in Cambodia. Contact <nowiki>[[http://zenerves.net/linux/index.html|Tropical Ice Cube]]</nowiki> for details.

Don
