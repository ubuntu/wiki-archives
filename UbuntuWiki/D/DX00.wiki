==== Linux Background ====

I started messing with Linux about 4 years ago but I kept putting it down for one reason or another. Around the time that Ubuntu 5.10 came out I heard about and decided to pick up Linux again. Ubuntu was easy enough for me to learn in a way that I didn't get to frustrated and I decided to stick with it. I haven't put it down since and I'm almost 100% MS free (only used it for gaming).
