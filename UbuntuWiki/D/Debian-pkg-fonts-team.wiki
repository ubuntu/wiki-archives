__TOC__


We are a team of maintainers using the <nowiki>[[https://alioth.debian.org/projects/pkg-fonts/|pkg-fonts Alioth project]]</nowiki> to co-maintain open fonts in upstream Debian and provide them to all interested derivatives.

These open font include font families released under the OFL (Open Font License <nowiki>[[http://scripts.sil.org/OFL|scripts.sil.org/OFL]]</nowiki>). See <nowiki>[[http://scripts.sil.org/OFL_fonts|OFL_fonts]]</nowiki> and [http://unifont.org/fontguide the unifont.org fontguide} for examples of open fonts.

Currently we mainly use this <nowiki>[[http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/pkg-fonts/|svn repository]]</nowiki> the hold the packaging for the various fonts and also have a mailing-list. We plan to make use of more Alioth features later on.

If you want to help maintain fonts, you can join us there.

There is also a launchpad team: [https://launchpad.net/~fonts fonts team}.
