=== Summary ===

This specification describes a centralized user account system to allow all applications accessing user accounts a consistent view.

Fedora has a similar goal for fedora 13 and the project is very advanced : <nowiki>[[http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/UserAccountDialog|Wiki page]]</nowiki>

=== Rationale ===

Currently user account information is managed and stored in multiple locations including:
* /etc/passwd
* Login images in ~/.face or ...
Multiple applications access this information:
* gdm
* user switch applet
* gnome-system-tools
* system-tools-backends
* gnome-about-me
* ConsoleKit
* ...
Each application tends to have the same code to access all this information and don't reliable handle users being added and deleted.

=== User stories ===

=== Assumptions ===

=== Design ===

Provide a central D-Bus server with control over the following:
* user information (name, uid, icon, ...)
* group management
* user addition/deletion
* notification of user changes
* switching to that user
* integration with telepathy?
