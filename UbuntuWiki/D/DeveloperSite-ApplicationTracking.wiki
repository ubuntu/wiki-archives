__TOC__

This is the outline of a specification for how <nowiki>[[http://developer.ubuntu.com/|the Ubuntu developer site]]</nowiki> should accept and present application submissions from developers, and show usage and ranking for published applications.

=== General ===

==== Developer registers an account ====

<nowiki>[[File:publishing-account.png]]</nowiki>

The “Company name:” field should be sensitive whenever “I submit apps on behalf of a company” is checked.

The “Different Paypal address:” field should be sensitive whenever its checkbox is checked.

As much as practical, the address fields should match the selected country. For example, if “United States” is selected, there should be a “Zip:” field.

Until it has manually been changed for the first time, the “Phone number:” field should be pre-filled with “+” and the country code for the selected country.

==== Reviewer sees submitted applications ====

==== Reviewer tweaks application details ====

So that they can fix typos and other small errors, reviewers should have the same “Edit” links, to the same forms for editing details, as an application developer does (bug Bug:797093).

==== Reviewer reviews an application ====

When you are signed in as a reviewer, the application screen should have a “Review” link that opens a “Reviewing” page in a separate tab/window.

* When “Ask the submitter for more information” is selected, the comment field should be “Your message to the '''submitter''' ({name of submitter}):”.

* When “Reject the application” or “Approve for publication” are selected, the comment field should be “Your message to the '''submitter''' ({name of submitter}) (optional):”.

* When “Return to the packager for corrections” is selected, the comment field should be “Your message to the '''packager''':” (bug Bug:857414).
