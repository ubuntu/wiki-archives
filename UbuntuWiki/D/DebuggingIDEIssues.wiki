== Introduction ==

This page describes how to debug issue with IDE harddrives, CDROM and DVD drives.

Chances are that if you have newer hardware and are running a newer distribution, you are using the ata_piix module.

== Debugging procedure ==

=== Temporary ===
* On power on, press 'Escape' to get the Grub boot menu
* Add the following kernel command line parameters at the end
<pre>
break=top, modprobe ide_generic all_generic_ide=1
</pre>
* To do this press ''e'' to edit then go down to kernel and press ''e'' again. When done adding press ''ESC'' to go back and then ''b'' to boot with this option.
=== Permanent ===
To make this persistent you can edit the grub config file as root such as gksudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst
