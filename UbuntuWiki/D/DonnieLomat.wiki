__TOC__

Am an undergraduate student of Lyceum of the Philippines, currently taking up BS Information Technology.  I started using GNU/Linux late last year and encountered Ubuntu last January 2005, iirc. A member of Ubuntu LoCo Team Philippines, I helped quite a bit in the translation work of the team but is slowly focusing my efforts in advocacy of Free Software (in general) and Ubuntu, of course.
