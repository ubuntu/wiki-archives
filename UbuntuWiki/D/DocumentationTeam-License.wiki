== Our Documentation License ==

As from the Ubuntu 7.04 (Feisty Fawn) release, the Ubuntu system documentation will be released under a new licensing policy.

The license is the <nowiki>[[http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/|Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike]]</nowiki> license.

If you wish to use the documentation you can do so, under the terms of this license.

The main points for use of the documentation in derivative works are:

* They must be released under an identical license
* Attribution must be given to the original authors and contributors 

Commercial use may be made of the material within these terms.

Note: The <nowiki>[[http://doc.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/packagingguide/C/index.html|Ubuntu Packaging Guide]]</nowiki> is an exception to the Documentation Team licensing policy and is released under the <nowiki>[[http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html|GNU General Public License (GPL) ]]</nowiki> to maintain compatibility with Debian development documentation.

== Other code ==

Third party code or applications used to process Ubuntu Documentation source-code should be available under a license that satisifies the Ubuntu License evaluation criteria.

Code sources such as shell or python scripts or make files developed by members of the Ubuntu Documentation Project to be used in the processing of documentation source-code must be released under a Free Software or Open Source license as well. Ideally, this will be the GNU GPL (althought other Free Software licenses are fine as well).
