__TOC__

CategoryEdubuntuCleanup is a temporary category to be used for cleaning up the edubuntu wiki space.<<BR>>
It is temporary because there are <nowiki>[[HelpWikiQualityAssurance|plans]]</nowiki> to use CategoryCleanup across the ubuntu wiki-space.

Refer to <nowiki>[[Edubuntu/Wiki/Cleanup]]</nowiki> for related implementation. Refer also to <nowiki>[[Edubuntu/Wiki/Archive]]</nowiki> for archived pages.

This category was created on 18/12/2006 and should hopefully not be needed beyond 31/03/2007.
