=== Introduction ===

<nowiki>[[File:ubuntu_classroom_logo.png||align="left"]]</nowiki>

<<BR>> The Ubuntu Classroom is part of the <nowiki>[[Learning|Ubuntu Community Learning Project]]</nowiki>. <<BR>><<BR>>

The idea of The Classroom is to host regular tutorial sessions on the freenode IRC server in the <nowiki>[[http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=ubuntu-classroom|#ubuntu-classroom]]</nowiki> channel. The tutorials cover information for Ubuntu, Edubuntu, Kubuntu, Lubuntu, Mythbuntu, Ubuntu Server, Ubuntu Studio and Xubuntu users, primarily on ways in which the user can contribute back to the Ubuntu project. The Classroom attempts to have sessions for all levels of expertise, from beginner to advanced. These sessions are instructed by members and teams within Ubuntu community and last about one hour.<<BR>><<BR>>

'''''Why Ubuntu Classroom?''''' Several teams within Ubuntu offer IRC sessions. Classroom seeks to be a centralized location for these sessions to be held and resources documented. Ubuntu Classroom currently hosts classes for the following:

* UbuntuOpenWeek
* UbuntuDeveloperWeek
* UbuntuAppDeveloperWeek
* UserDays

Is your team hosting classes but not involved with Classroom? Feel free to join the <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/Ubuntu-classroom|Ubuntu Classroom Mailing List]]</nowiki> and get involved!

=== Presenting in #ubuntu-classroom ===

If you or your team is interested in presenting in <nowiki>[[http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=ubuntu-classroom|#ubuntu-classroom]]</nowiki>, please have a look at the information on both the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Classroom/Submissions|submissions]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Classroom/Guidelines|guidelines]]</nowiki> pages.

=== IRC Channel ===
The Ubuntu community is currently utilizing the <nowiki>[[http://www.freenode.net|freenode]]</nowiki> servers for IRC. If you are going to join a session, the channel to use is <nowiki>[[http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=ubuntu-classroom|#ubuntu-classroom]]</nowiki>. If it is your first time using IRC, we ask that you simply review the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/IRC/Guidelines|IRC Guidelines]]</nowiki>. You may also be interested in this list of <nowiki>[[Classroom-IRCHOWTO| IRC HOWTO]]</nowiki> Pages.  To connect to the IRC server, use the following information:
* '''Server:''' ''irc.ubuntu.com''
* '''Port:''' ''8001''
Once connected to the server type /join <nowiki>[[http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=ubuntu-classroom|#ubuntu-classroom]]</nowiki> to join the classroom channel. <nowiki>[[http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=ubuntu-classroom|#ubuntu-classroom]]</nowiki> isn't the main support channels, so you can't expect to join it searching for answers, as most of the time it is a ghost towns. We recommend you continue using <nowiki>[[http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=ubuntu|#ubuntu]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=kubuntu|#kubuntu]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=edubuntu|#edubuntu]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#lubuntu|#lubuntu]]</nowiki> or <nowiki>[[http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#xubuntu|#xubuntu]]</nowiki> for support.

=== Information ===

The classes will start promptly at the designated times. The classroom will be open briefly in order to provide the members and students the opportunity for brief introductions and instructions. Once the class begins, the channel may become moderated (+m), meaning only instructors and administrators will have speaking privileges. This will insure there are no interruptions, making the class enjoyable for everyone attending. If the class is moderated, questions can be asked in <nowiki>[[http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=ubuntu-classroom-chat|#ubuntu-classroom-chat]]</nowiki>. The proper way to ask a question in <nowiki>[[http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=ubuntu-classroom-chat|#ubuntu-classroom-chat]]</nowiki> is: <code>QUESTION: Type your question here</code>. Further instructions will be given at the beginning of each class.

See the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Classroom/Guidelines|Ubuntu Classroom Guidelines]]</nowiki> for more details.

=== Logs/Transcripts ===

The classroom sessions are recorded, along with all the Ubuntu related IRC logs at <nowiki>[[http://irclogs.ubuntu.com/|Ubuntu IRC logs]]</nowiki>. To find the transcript you want you must know the date of the event as the logs are stored by date. Visit <nowiki>[[http://irclogs.ubuntu.com/|Ubuntu IRC logs]]</nowiki> and select the year, then the month and date on the subsequent pages. This will give you a list of all the Ubuntu related IRC logs for that day, available as both a text file and html (for your web browser). Navigate to the Ubuntu classroom logs, #ubuntu-classroom.html and #ubuntu-classroom.txt and select a format.
