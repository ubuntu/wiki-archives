==== Description ====

The Solano Stroll <nowiki>[[http://www.solanoavenueassn.org/strol.htm|event]]</nowiki> is a ~ mile long street fair held once a year in Berkeley California  on Solano Ave.  There are over 500 vendor and non-profit booths.  Attendees are ordinary folks from the Berkeley/SF-Bay area who may or may not have a technical background.  It is, thus, a good opportunity to advertise Ubuntu to a general audience.  

* '''Date:''' Sunday, September 12th 2010
* '''Time:''' 10am - 6pm
* '''Location:''' Booth will be at 1223 Solano Ave., Berkeley
