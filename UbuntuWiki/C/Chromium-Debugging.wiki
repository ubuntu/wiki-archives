__TOC__


If Chromium crashes and you want to file a bug upstream, use their <nowiki>[[http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/entry?template=Defect%20on%20Linux|linux template]]</nowiki>. Always include the output from the following command:

<pre>
$ dpkg -l | grep chromium-
</pre>

You'll need to provide a <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Backtrace|backtrace]]</nowiki>. It can be produced using gdb, with the help of debugging symbols.

=== Getting a backtrace ===
Debugging symbols come in packages that can be <nowiki>[[InstallingSoftware|installed just like any other software package]]</nowiki> in Ubuntu. The debugging symbols package for Chromium is called ''chromium-browser-dbg''. Once you've installed it, open a terminal and proceed as follows:

<pre>
$ chromium-browser --debug 2>&1 | tee gdb-chromium.txt
(gdb) handle SIG33 pass nostop noprint
(gdb) set pagination 0
(gdb) run <arguments, if any>
</pre>

Do what you need to do to trigger the crash, then:

<pre>
(gdb) backtrace
(gdb) thread apply all backtrace
(gdb) quit
</pre>

If the backtrace shows lots of lines with question marks (such as "#5&nbsp;0x083949e0&nbsp;in&nbsp;??&nbsp;()"), you're likely to need additional debugging symbols packages. To find out which libraries Chromium is loading, try:

<pre>
$ ldd /usr/lib/chromium-browser/chromium-browser
</pre>

Then look for corresponding -dbg or -dbgsym packages in the repositories.

=== Debugging child processes ===
Since Chromium normally spawns several processes (such as the sandbox and renderers), the backtrace from the browser process may not be useful (unless it is the main process that crashes). For catching backtraces from Chromium's child processes, you should run Chromium with --single-process:

<pre>
$ chromium-browser --debug --single-process 2>&1 | tee gdb-chromium.txt
</pre>

Then proceed as above with gdb.

Once you feel your backtrace file (gdb-chromium.txt) is sufficient, attach it to your bug report.
