The Ubuntu California LoCo has been accepted as an exhibitor at the <nowiki>[[http://socallinuxexpo.org/scale6x/|Southern California Linux Expo]]</nowiki>!

SCaLE6x is February 8-10 (Fri-Sun).  The Expo is open Saturday and Sunday, with Friday being reserved for the mini-conferences.  Doors open at 8am Saturday for setup, and 11am to the general public (10am is the keynote) <nowiki>[[http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale6x/conference-info/schedules/|See Full Schedule]]</nowiki>.  Parking is $8/self with validation ($12 without).

== Planning ==
If you think of anything else (large or small) we need, please add it to the list.  If the reason it is needed/wanted isn't obvious, explain the reasoning in the description area.  This should be an all encompassing list, from duct tape to computers to scratch paper.  When in doubt, add it and mention you're unsure in the description.

If you can provide something, please sign your name in the volunteer column (more than one person per item is fine).  If you have anything else to say about it (like, "I'm 60% sure I have one of these") use the comments field.  If you're providing a part of something (a computer but no monitor) make sure you mention that as well.

If you can't figure out the wiki formatting, just add items/comments underneath, and someone else will come wikify it.

Feel free to make any comments/suggestions/additions!
