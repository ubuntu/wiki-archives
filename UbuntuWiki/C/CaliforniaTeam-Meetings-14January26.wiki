[03:01] <eps> Â¡Yo!
[03:01] <pleia2> ok, so only thing on the agenda is scale prep, less than a month away!
[03:01] <pleia2> #topic SCaLE planning
[03:01] <pleia2> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CaliforniaTeam/Projects/Scale12x
[03:01] <darthrobot`> Title: [CaliforniaTeam/Projects/Scale12x - Ubuntu Wiki]
[03:01] <pleia2> I gave rww a bag full of goodies to take down for the booth :)
[03:01] <raevol> i'm excited for SCaLE
[03:02] <raevol> pleia2: are you going to be there>
[03:02] <pleia2> yep!
[03:02] <philipballew> So Michelle has been on holiday, but she is back, and I believe will be sending me a conf pack in the next few days.
[03:02] <pleia2> probably not at the booth a lot, but I have talks at ubucon and main conference
[03:02] <pleia2> philipballew: great
[03:02] <philipballew> I got the exhibitor kit yesterday I think.
[03:03] <philipballew> I emailed Steve, and he confirmed it works.
[03:03] <raevol> excellent
[03:03] <pleia2> \o/
[03:03] <pleia2> do we have a booth number?
[03:03] <philipballew> now I only need to email one other person on the wiki who is not speaking/working and getting in otherwise.
[03:03]  * philipballew looks
[03:04] <philipballew> 17
[03:05] <pleia2> cool, I'll add to the wiki
[03:05] <pleia2> is there a map too? :)
[03:05] <raevol> i didn't get a chance to write up some handouts about FAQs like unity or the shopping lens :(
[03:05] <pleia2> there is still time
[03:05] <raevol> yea
[03:05] <raevol> i will try to sneak it in
[03:05] <philipballew> si pleia2
[03:06] <pleia2> http://spreadubuntu.org/en/material/poster/start-ubuntu-addis-announcement was also interesting, thinking about modifying it to s/mint/xubuntu
[03:06] <darthrobot`> Title: [Start Ubuntu in Addis announcement | spreadubuntu]
[03:07] <eps> Is Mint still relevant with MATE going into 14.04 LTS?
[03:07] <pleia2> it still ships with proprietary codecs and binaries that aren't strictly legal to ship in the US (so Ubuntu can't), so I think there will still be a market
[03:07] <pleia2> not among professional users, but the typical mint userbase
[03:08] <philipballew> pleia2, were you wanting to put up all your posters and candy this year again?
[03:08] <pleia2> philipballew: I'm bringing it and rww is looking into candy, up to you whether you want/need them
[03:09] <pleia2> err eps
[03:09] <pleia2> one of those 3 letter nicknames :)
[03:09] <eps> :-)
[03:09] <raevol> philipballew: we got some system76 laptops?
[03:09] <philipballew> pleia2, nobody needs to spend their money for candy probably.
[03:09] <philipballew> unless they want to I guess
[03:09] <philipballew> raevol, yes, confirmed this week with Ema.
[03:09] <raevol> cool
[03:10] <raevol> what day are you guys getting there?
[03:10] <pleia2> thursday night
[03:10] <rww> thursday night
[03:10] <pleia2> my ubucon talk is the first of the day on friday
[03:10] <rww> driving down from the bay area at like 5pm
[03:10] <rww> so i'll be there late
[03:10] <philipballew> whenever raevol picks me up
[03:10] <ianorlin> not far from my house
[03:10] <raevol> philipballew: ;D hehe. drive up thursday night ok?
[03:10] <pleia2> schedule went up today :) https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale12x/schedule/friday <-- includes ubucon
[03:10] <darthrobot`> Title: [Friday, February 22, 2013 | SCALE 12x]
[03:10] <pleia2> ianorlin: you should come!
[03:10] <philipballew> raevol, perfect
[03:10] <eps> philipballew: do you have a sponsor lined up for candy/other giveaways?
[03:11] <philipballew> eps, No.
[03:11] <philipballew> Does candy bring people to the booth or not?
[03:11] <eps> Well, then not spending money really isn't an option, is it?
[03:11] <eps> Yes, absolutely.
[03:11] <ianorlin> althogh grr parents made dinner ready now
[03:11] <philipballew> eps, would you feel comfortable wearing a shirt that says "free hugs" on it?
[03:11] <philipballew> might bring some people?
[03:12] <pleia2> oh dear
[03:12] <raevol> should we consider getting some candy that's individually wrapped? the m&ms were tasty but i felt kind of weird after a given quantity of people had stuck their hands in the bowl
[03:12] <eps> Depends ... is that like "free tibet" or "free beer"
[03:12] <rww> "open source hug party"
[03:12] <philipballew> haha
[03:13] <raevol> libre hugs
[03:13] <eps> FYI, Hugs are a variant of Hershey's Kisses, and they are individually wrapped.
[03:13] <raevol> the source code of this hug is freely available and any modifications you make to this hug when redistributing must also be freely available
[03:13] <pleia2> hahah
[03:13] <raevol> eps: genius
[03:14] <eps> The M&Ms were two years ago. Last year, we had buttercream mints.
[03:14] <pleia2> ok, any more updates re: scale? action items for the next couple weeks?
[03:14] <raevol> eps: woops
[03:14] <rww> I have a full ISO set for 13.10 now, will get 12.04.whatever when the next one's released early Feb
[03:14] <rww> including Ubuntu Kylin, which is seeded by like nobody
[03:14] <pleia2> the caramel hersey kisses are orange and brown, we could be retro :)
[03:14] <philipballew> Ubuntu shaped cookies would be cool
[03:15] <raevol> pleia2: jono will confiscate them
[03:15] <pleia2> raevol: haha, not on brand!
[03:15] <raevol> xD
[03:15] <eps> rww: Feb. 4, I think.
[03:15] <rww> yep
[03:15] <rww> way before scale, anyway
[03:15] <raevol> (and then he will eat them)
[03:15] <rww> considered 14.04, but i don't think i'm going to bother
[03:15] <philipballew> If you have an ubuntu shit, you should wear it to the booth when working.
[03:15] <rww> lol ^
[03:15] <rww> i have a brown ubuntu shirt, does that count?
[03:15] <philipballew> I do not want to see anyone in a Fedora shirt at the booth
[03:15] <raevol> hahahahahahahahaa
[03:16] <rww> philipballew: so no MarkDude, then?
[03:16] <philipballew> rww, "what can brown do for you."
[03:16] <eps> Has anyone heard from MarkDude lately?
[03:16] <pleia2> he pops up on facebook now and then, so I know he's alive :)
[03:16] <philipballew> I herd he might be going to Manila sometime.
[03:18] <raevol> sweet
[03:19] <pleia2> #topic Any other business
[03:19] <pleia2> anything else to chat about?
[03:19] <philipballew> Nope

[03:20] <darthrobot`> Title: [Ubuntu Hour Berkeley | Ubuntu LoCo Team Portal]

[03:21] <darthrobot`> Title: [[Ubuntu-US-CA] Running an Ubuntu App Dev School - can anyone help?]
[03:22] <pleia2> unclear so far whether it'll be mt view or sf
[03:22] <philipballew> Either one should be good.
