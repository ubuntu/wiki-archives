==== About Me ====
* Full Name: Christopher L. Cmolik
* AIM SN: Christehdude
* Experiance with Linux: 3 years
* Distributions I've tried (in no particular order):
** Fedora Core
** Mepis
** Debian 
** SUSE
** Slackware
** Gentoo
** Knoppix (who hasn't :-) )
** Ubuntu (of course)
As you can see, i've tried many different distributions of linux.
I am interested in porting various applications to Ubuntu, including (but not limited to):
** Rundns (program to automatically update DynDNS account)
** XPDE
** Whatever I am told to port to Ubuntu
* Strong advocate of Open Source software
==== Availability ====
** My time varies every week, usually 5:30 PM EST to 9:00 PM EST, but about once a week, and on weekends, 9:30 AM-?
==== Other Interests ====
I dual-boot Windows and Ubuntu, and found the transition to linux rather easy, because i had a book on Linux.  I would also like to (possibly) write a Windows to Linux migration guide, (I apologize if this has already been done.)
