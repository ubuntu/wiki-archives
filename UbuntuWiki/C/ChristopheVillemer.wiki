== About me ==

Despite I'm french (nobody's perfect), I reside in Montréal since april 2004 and I love it ! 
I was before in Hanoi, Vietnam for almost 6 years and I also spent a year and a half in Iceland. 

I'm executive vice-president of <nowiki>[[http://www.savoirfairelinux.com |Savoir-faire Linux Inc.]]</nowiki>, the OpenSource leading company in Québec. 

In another life, I was CIO of the <nowiki>[[http://www.auf.org|Agence universitaire de la Francophonie]]</nowiki>

I've been using Ubuntu since the HoaryHedgehog release and I'm now an Ubuntu addict.
