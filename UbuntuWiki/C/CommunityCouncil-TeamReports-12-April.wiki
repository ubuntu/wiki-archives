* 2012-04-05 Meeting (<nowiki>[[http://irclogs.ubuntu.com/2012/04/05/%23ubuntu-meeting.html#t17:03|log]]</nowiki>):
** Danny Piccirillo brought the agenda item "Bug #1"
** "bug #1 is a bit vague because it is specific to microsoft"
** Proposed <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bug1|new Bug 1]]</nowiki>
** It was generally agreed that Ubuntu has grown beyond the "smallminded tease" that Bug #1 is, as it was never fully serious
** Mark Shuttleworth summed it up as "i think it would be a mistake to turn bug 1 from tease to dogma"
** Representatives from the Asia/Oceania Regional Membership Board were not available due to time zones
** Decided to move teams page draft into production, updated version now live at <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Teams]]</nowiki>
** Reviewed some of the proposed changes to the CoC for v2.0, decided to do further review and then blog about it on fridge for community input which Laura Czajkowski will collect and put on a wiki page
* 2012-04-19 Meeting (<nowiki>[[http://irclogs.ubuntu.com/2012/04/19/%23ubuntu-meeting.html#t17:02|log]]</nowiki>):
** Meet-up with ARB
** WORKFLOW
*** queue:
*** ARB feel like they generally caught up.
*** need feedback → the entry disappears from the queue (bug #927588)
*** expire/reject would be nice (My``Apps team is aware)
*** no rating / importance system
*** some confusion about how many items are in the queue (~20 need ARB attention right now, ~70 in the queue generally)
*** 8 apps launched last cycle, 2-5 apps new apps get processed each week, time-to-first-response less than a week
*** app developers who don't reply on feedback are a concern.
*** if submitter gets it right, the process is fast enough
*** general process:
*** pick off quick responses
*** pick off apps which need slightly more investigation
*** clear out old apps which need packaging
** PACKAGING PROBLEMS:
*** app submitters need a lot of help
*** education and hands-on help is necessary, otherwise no apps go through the queue at all
*** some old apps are still in the queue which have no packaging at all (which is a requirement now)
*** /opt is a big problem (quickly, pkgme and all of our other tools basically don't adhere to it yet)
** TEAM
*** need more volunteers
*** needs restaffing soon
*** staying motivated is hard - working together might help
*** communication seems to work well: IRC + votes on the list mostly, monthly meetings
*** idea of having an arb-helper team has been kicking around for a while
** Current team in LP: https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-app-review-contributors
** TODO: set guidelines for the team, start using and promoting it
** top prio problems on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AppReviewBoard/Agenda
** Miscommunication with Canonical Community Team
*** felt under pressure in January
*** differing views on how many apps are actually in the queue - due to 1) not being able to expire/reject, 2) needs info apps falling out    of the queue
** dpm's help with coordination was very useful, also his work on inspiring new contributors.
