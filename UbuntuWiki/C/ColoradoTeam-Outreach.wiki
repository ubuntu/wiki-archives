__TOC__

The US ColoradoTeam has been involved in outreach about Ubuntu and open source software to others in Colorado over the years.

On several occasions, led by JimHutchinson, we've put on presentations at the Colorado Technology In Education (TIE) Conference (http://tiecolorado.org/), a major event every year for K-12 educators in the state.  At times we've had a booth sponsored by Canonical, a technology lab full of Ubuntu workstations booting off an HP server, demos of educational applications, and other presentations.
