__TOC__

In this example I will asume you have an existing Ubuntu 6.06.1 install, and you want to dual boot with gNewSense. Ubuntu is installed on the first hard drive (hda), and gNewSense on the second (hdb)

* Install gNewSense as you would normally.

* Boot into gNewSense

* Mount Ubuntu into a chroot:

<pre>
sudo mkdir /mnt/Ubuntu

sudo mount /dev/hda1 /mnt/Ubuntu

sudo mount --bind /dev/ /mnt/Ubuntu/dev/

sudo mount --bind /proc/ /mnt/Ubuntu/proc/
</pre>

* Chroot in:

<pre>
sudo chroot /opt/
</pre>

Note:

If your install is on the same hdd, you will have to do this slightly differently, but i'll fix it up later.

<pre>
sudo grub-install /dev/hdax
</pre>

* Type "exit" to leave the chroot

* Now add os2 to menu.lst

<pre>
sudo vi /boot/grub/menu.lst
</pre>

* Scroll down to *bellow* the line reading thus:

`### END DEBIAN AUTOMAGIC KERNELS LIST`

And add the following lines:

1. what will be displayed

` title Boot Ubuntu 6.06.1 LTS `

1. partition to look for the bootloader

` root (hd1,0) `

1. load the bootloader, not the one on mbr

` chainloader +1 `

* Save and quit.

* Your done!
