== Hello from Melbourne, Florida! ==

I am a former Marine, and belong to Florida's Ubuntu Local Community Team. I really like how the ubuntu community has created this network of Local Communities! I was a Debian "Woody / SID" user prior to using Ubuntu when it was first released. 

It's kind of ironic looking back, at the time I had recently purchased an AMD-64 Shuttle that was top of the line. During that period there were only a handful of distributions that supported 64-bit, This oddly named distro appeared near the top of my google search, "Ubuntu". I first downloaded the i386 live cd, and went on from there to download and install the AMD 64 version, and then on to install Unreal Tournament Tournament which released a 64-bit version of the game shortly after.

I will be on irc as often as I can and use itnet7 as my irc Nick.

I have been trying to organize install fest for local computer user groups as well as take PC's that my work is disposing of, installing ubuntu and re-purposing them

Hobbies: I really like to play the Acoustic Guitar, when I am not busy downloading podcasts for my daily commutes to work. I also love to spend extra time with my Family!
