==== About Me ====
My name's Christopher Meiklejohn.  I've used Linux for a long time, but there was an unfortunate period where I switched to Mac OS X.  Thankfully, I'm back.

I'm one of the lead developers and engineers for Berklee College of Music's online extension school, where we run Ubuntu exclusively.  I also triage bugs for Ubuntu in the BugSquad, and write a lot of Ruby code.

I'm also extremely interested in Amazon Web Services, which I write Ruby code to interact with.

You can contact me through Launchpad, or on IRC (#ubuntu-bugs, #u1msbeta, etc.)
