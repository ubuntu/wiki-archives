== September 2010 Community Report : Art ==

<nowiki>[[CommunityReview-Sep2010|<-- Back to the main Community Report page]]</nowiki>

This report is being put together by: '''Martin Owens'''

This report is here to satisfy the following use case:

<pre>
Sam would like to make Ubuntu and the community look prettier and doesn't know where to start?
</pre>

The goal of this assessment to identify what typical experience Sam may have and areas in which it can be improved.

=== Assessment Process ===

To perform this assessment we would like to ask those involved to perform the following steps:

1. First put yourself in the position of Sam who has no idea how to participate within this area. How does find out about to participate, where our resources are, which communication channels they can use etc? Please enter your findings into the ''Discoverability'' section below.
2. How does Sam learn the skills to participate in this area? Enter your findings in the ''Learnability' section below.
3. How does Sam know what to work on and how to contribute? Enter your findings in the ''Doability'' section below.
4. Find five community members who are very new to the community and ask them to answer the questions in the ''New Community Member Feedback'' section below.
5. Finally, review all the findings you have notes down here and propose a set of improvements that are concrete things we can work on. Note these in the ''Recommendations For Improvement'' section below.

=== Findings ===

''To ensure our work is as useful as possible, please ensure that all findings are factual and not based on opinion and perception, and where possible, backed up with links to resources that outline the findings''.

==== Discoverability ====

Items to consider:

* How do new community members typically start learning about the community?

** A google search for '<nowiki>[[http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&source=hp&q=ubuntu+artwork&btnG=Google+Search#sclient=psy&hl=en&q=ubuntu+art&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai=&pbx=1&fp=7b3e9e0669ddb0a1|Ubuntu art]]</nowiki>':
** '''Ubuntu Art website''', similar website to gnome-look.org, low connectivity to other teams/groups, no connection to ubuntu-art team mailing list or irc channel. Own separate Forums, own separate Q/A section, Sub-groups, uploading of non-packaged artwork, peer voting.
** '''Artwork Wiki Page''', official home of the Ubuntu Artwork team. High connectivity to other ubuntu artwork groups, links to mailing lists and irc, artwork submitted to wiki and educational topics.
** A google search for "<nowiki>[[http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&source=hp&q=ubuntu+artwork&btnG=Google+Search#hl=en&expIds=17259,25659,25907,25941,26751,26757,26758&sugexp=ldymls&tok=KSGbpdta_k0gUQe4ypPwow&xhr=t&q=How+to+contribute+art+to+Ubuntu&cp=31&pf=p&sclient=psy&aq=f&aqi=g2g-o1&aql=&oq=How+to+contribute+wallpappers+to+Ubuntu&gs_rfai=&pbx=1&fp=4e781b66e30e329a|How to contribute wallpapers|icons to Ubuntu]]</nowiki>" - Nothing useful
* What is the primary web pages and points of contact when new community members get involved?
** <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Artwork|Artwork Wiki Page]]</nowiki>
* Are there magazines, other websites and other resources that often act as on-ramps for community members to get involved?
** <nowiki>[[http://ubuntu-artists.deviantart.com|deviantArt Ubuntu Community]]</nowiki>
** <nowiki>[[http://www.flickr.com/groups/ubuntu-artwork/|Ubuntu Artwork Flickr group]]</nowiki>

==== Learnability ====

Items to consider:

* What documentation/resources are available?
** Anything that's on the wiki: <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Artwork/Documentation|Artwork Documentation]]</nowiki>
* What support channels are available to help them learn?
** Mostly the team leaning is done on Mailing List or independently using guides and texts available.

Critically - from the perspective of someone completely new to learning the skills in this area of the community, are our resources easy to follow and understand?

The guides cover a lot of the community interaction and process learning, but few or no guides on artistic matters. A few art guides exist on the deviantArt users group and a couple are available on the wiki. More could be done to bring in documentation from inkscape, gimp and other projects where they have these guides written.

==== Doability ====

Items to consider:

* How does someone know what to work on?
** The wiki lists some tasks that can be done: <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Artwork/Tasks|Artwork Tasks]]</nowiki>
* How do they contribute their work back?
** Wiki page submission, packaging directly into debian/ubuntu or an outside group like flickr/deviantArt and ubuntu-art.org
* How easy is it for Sam to understand how this works?
** Not very, it's confusing and going in multiple directions.
