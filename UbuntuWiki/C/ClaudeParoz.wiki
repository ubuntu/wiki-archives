After contributing to and having led the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-l10n-fr|ubuntu-l10n-fr translation team]]</nowiki>, I'm now mostly active in GNOME i18n project (http://live.gnome.org/TranslationProject/CoordinationTeam). <<BR>>
Of course I'm using Ubuntu since at least 10 years :-?
