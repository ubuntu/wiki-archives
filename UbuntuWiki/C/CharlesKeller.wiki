__TOC__

I am a student at Georgia State University majoring in Political Science.  I started using Linux when I was 17 during the days of Mandrake Linux, but I didn't start using it again until I came to GSU and started using Ubuntu.  I am a gamer when I have the time, and I'm currently trying to get as many of my games working in Linux and wine as possible - in large part because I don't currently have a Windows box of any kind, and my girlfriend would really appreciate it if I didn't randomly steal her computer to play Jade Empire and the like!
