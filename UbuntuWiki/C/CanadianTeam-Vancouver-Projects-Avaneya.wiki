__TOC__

''Earth is a write off. The year is 2082 AD and the struggle for social justice and human rights has inevitably followed early settlers into their first Martian city-state republics.

Broken neoclassical economics, corporate controlled media, fractional reserve central banks, false flags, over industrialization, and a delicate supply of natural capital will challenge you as governor in a new world which is hostile and intolerant of mistakes.''

Free as in freedom, GPLv3, commercial, science fiction entertainment for the cerebral GNU/Linux community.
