<pre>
(20:59:36) <jpds> OK.
(21:00:06) <jcastro> hi!
(21:00:37) <tsdgeos> ho
(21:01:29) <jpds> I suppose only tsdgeos and alex_muntada are here from the Catalan team...
(21:02:00) <tsdgeos> only familiar names
(21:03:10) <alex_muntada> hi!
(21:04:50) <jpds> jcastro: So, Jorge, how may we help you?
(21:05:14) <jcastro> well
(21:05:24) <jcastro> I redid the uds wiki pages with some help from people
(21:05:45) <jcastro> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UDSKarmic
(21:05:56) <jcastro> this is supposed to be easier to use than it used to be
(21:06:21) <jcastro> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UDSKarmic/LocalParticipation
(21:06:33) <jcastro> this will be where we put local things, like restaurants and whatnot
(21:06:48) <jcastro> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UDSKarmic/Travel
(21:06:57) <jcastro> and directions to and from the airport go there
(21:07:05) <jcastro> I see someone has put in links already
(21:07:29) <tsdgeos> jcastro: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UDSKarmic/Travel ← that's wrong, Palau de Congressos de Catalunya is not a hotel, just an auditorium, i guess you mean Hotel Juan Carlos I there
(21:07:46) <alex_muntada> tsdgeos: just fixed it right now
(21:07:51) <jcastro> I am not sure, I didn't put in the link, heh
(21:07:57) <alex_muntada> it was me
(21:08:01) <jcastro> so it's a good thing you guys reviewed it
(21:08:03) <jpds> Are many people going to be driving from the airport?
(21:08:27) <jcastro> doubtful, I guess most will find public transportation
(21:08:46) <jcastro> Is there anything you guys feel is missing from those pages?
(21:09:45) <tsdgeos> Schedule links to https://blueprints.launchpad.net/sprints/uds-karmic
(21:09:48) <tsdgeos> is that correct?
(21:11:03) <jcastro> that's a placeholder, the scheduler link isn't active yet
(21:11:11) <jcastro> good point though, I need to link to that
(21:11:32) <tsdgeos> ok
(21:12:53) <jcastro> I put it to a more sane link
(21:13:07) <alex_muntada> I hope that someone knows how to make beautiful maps on google, I will gather a few links to add to the map
(21:13:40) <jcastro> there is no way to embed the map in the wiki page is there?
(21:13:45) <jcastro> or is links the best way?
(21:14:59) <alex_muntada> I'm sure there is a way, just happens that I don't know it yet ;-)
(21:15:08) <jcastro> also, I used an apt:// link in the remote page so people can just click and install gobby. :D
(21:15:57) <jpds> w00t Canonical IS.
(21:16:46) <jcastro> I think the pages look great
(21:16:51) <jcastro> we missing anything else?
(21:18:03) <alex_muntada> not that I can think of right now
(21:18:05) <tsdgeos> i think it's ok
(21:18:21) <jpds> jcastro: What kind of things do you want to be put into the 'things people are interested in'? Stuff like Perl group meetings? Or anything?
(21:18:36) <jcastro> jpds: I think those will be during the week
(21:18:40) <jcastro> like "I like this restaurant"
(21:18:50) <jcastro> or maybe famous tourist-type places
(21:18:59) <jcastro> "this museum was good" kind of thing
(21:20:39) <jpds> alex_muntada: You got the metro sorted, awesome!
(21:22:20) <alex_muntada> it still needs a map maybe, to show the path to the hotel
(21:29:01) <jpds> According to Google+moinmoin help: http://paste.ubuntu.com/148534/plain/ should be what's needed to embed an image, but I think there's something server-side blocking it.
(21:30:26) <jcastro> I think a link would be sufficient
(21:32:50) <jpds> OK.
(21:33:16) <jcastro> anything else?
(21:33:39) <RainCT> (Hi)
(21:34:16) <alex_muntada> jcastro: now that the UDSKarmic/* is set up, we well stard adding local information
(21:34:55) <alex_muntada> nothing else right now
(21:40:55) <alex_muntada> jpds: still editing UDSKarmic/Travel?
(21:41:02) <jcastro> ok great
(21:41:10) <jcastro> I guess we're all set, everyone have a good weekend!
