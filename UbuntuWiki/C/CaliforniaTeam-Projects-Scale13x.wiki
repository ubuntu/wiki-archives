Welcome to the page for Ubuntu California's presence at the <nowiki>[[https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/13x | 13th Southern California Linux Expo]]</nowiki>!  The expo runs from Febuary 19-22, 2015 (Thurs-Sun), but the exhibition floor will be open Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.

SCALE 6X in 2008 was Ubuntu California's second public event and the Lo``Co has maintained the Ubuntu booth ever since.  This year the Ubuntu booth will showcase Ubuntu and its derivatives, exciting new projects like Ubuntu Core, and Ubuntu running on phones.

Ubuntu California team members can use coupon code "UBNTU" for half off your Full Access pass registration.  Booth volunteers will receive a complimentary Exhibitor badge.
