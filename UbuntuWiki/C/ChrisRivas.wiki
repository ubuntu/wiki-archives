Hi, my name is Chris.  I'm an American presently living in Thailand working with software for <nowiki>[[http://www.sipa.or.th/|SIPA]]</nowiki>.  Work's mostly networking/IT (servers, applications and scripts) and programming when things work like they should. Thailand is nice; I rarely miss the cold.  Beer is cheap and there are lots of nice beaches, etc here too.

We are going to try to activate the ThaiTeam LoCo here in the very near future.

Thailand has an active Linux and Ubuntu community, including <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntuclub.com|ubuntuclub.com]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[http://www.thaiopensource.org|Thai Open Source]]</nowiki> and many other Thai organizations and companies.
