[02:00] <darthrobot`> Title: [CaliforniaTeam/Meetings/14August24 - Ubuntu Wiki]
[02:00] <pleia2> agenda!
[02:01] <pleia2> so I added the item
[02:01] <pleia2> #topic Upcoming events, are we participating?
[02:01] <DonkeyHotei> item?
[02:01] <pleia2> we have two big things coming up:
[02:01] <DonkeyHotei> ok.
[02:01] <pleia2> UbuntuGlobalJam September 12-14
[02:01] <pleia2> Software Freedom Day September 20th
[02:01] <pleia2> so far I haven't heard much about us doing either
[02:01] <pleia2> I think jyo was thinking about doing something for the jam though
[02:01] <pleia2> (I'll be on the wrong side of the country during it)
[02:02] <pleia2> any thoughts?
[02:02] <Roguehorse> Where is the SFD going on?
[02:02] <DonkeyHotei> any coordination with fedora folk regarding 9/20?
[02:03] <pleia2> California seems empty UbuntuGlobalJam September 12-14
[02:03] <pleia2> grr
[02:03] <pleia2> http://softwarefreedomday.org/map/index.php?year=2014
[02:03] <darthrobot`> Title: [SFD 2014 Map: Find an event in your area!]
[02:03] <pleia2> not to say none exist, but on the official site where events can register, there aren't any
[02:04] <DonkeyHotei> sounds like a first
[02:04] <Roguehorse> Just found that..thanks
[02:04] <pleia2> DonkeyHotei: no coordination with anyone so far, if you know of Fedora folks doing something, please do chat with them :)
[02:04] <Roguehorse> So we would have to host one?
[02:05] <pleia2> yeah, unless we find a LUG or other group already doing something
[02:05] <DonkeyHotei> Roguehorse: it might be nice
[02:06] <Roguehorse> I'm always game for doing stuff I just stink at the coordination
[02:06] <nhaines> Roguehorse: find a friend and help out with coordination.  You'd be surprised how quickly you learn.  :)
[02:06]  * nhaines vaguely remembers SCALE6X....
[02:07] <DonkeyHotei> i attended scale6x
[02:08] <Roguehorse> nhaines: Everyone in my LUG says they're too busy to help with anything...thus very slow progress
[02:08] <DonkeyHotei> your lug meets in a busy area
[02:08] <Roguehorse> I guess
[02:09] <nhaines> Roguehorse: any LoCo members nearby?
[02:10] <Roguehorse> Don't know.....I've only made it to one gig so far...14.04 launch. I think Grant lives nearby though (or not far)
[02:11] <grantbow> SFSU usually does an SFD event
[02:11] <grantbow> I'll ping sameer
[02:11] <rww> o/
[02:11] <Roguehorse> speaking of Grant
[02:13] <pleia2> grantbow: thanks
[02:14] <pleia2> anything happening in socal?
[02:15] <nhaines> Not that I know of.  I need to check with OCLUG on the status of the next installfest.
[02:16] <Roguehorse> grantbow: You want to work together to put on a SFD?
[02:16] <pleia2> nhaines: sounds good
[02:16] <pleia2> philipballew: anything in SD?
[02:16] <philipballew> pleia2, for sfd?
[02:17] <pleia2> philipballew: or ugj
[02:17] <grantbow> Roguehorse I'll help coordinate if you want to lead up an effort and attend.
[02:18] <Roguehorse> grantbow: Ok..we can talk after the meeting
[02:18] <philipballew> I am planning a ubuntu hour that I will call a ubuntu global jam where I show people how to report and file bugs. As for Software Freedom Day, I am speaking on open source stuff at the one in Tijuana Mexico, just over the border.
[02:18] <grantbow> ok
[02:18] <pleia2> philipballew: cool
[02:19] <philipballew> I'll try to remember to take pictures or both and shoot out a blog or two
[02:19] <pleia2> philipballew: please do!
[02:19] <DonkeyHotei> Roguehorse: if you were at the 14.04 launch, we probably met
[02:20] <pleia2> #topic Any other business
[02:20] <philipballew> Quallcomm still will not put up my ubuntu meetup flyer's at their office.
[02:20] <pleia2> that's all we had for agenda items, anyone else have anything?
[02:20] <eps> Utopic release party planning?
[02:21] <DonkeyHotei> i think it's a bit early
[02:21] <eps> DonkeyHotei: trust me, it isn't
[02:22] <pleia2> not early, we need to pin down a venue pretty early, it's only 2 months away
[02:22] <pleia2> October 23rd is release
[02:22] <DonkeyHotei> oh.
[02:22] <pleia2> I'll be in the wrong part of the world again
[02:23] <Roguehorse> ...don't you have some sort of assigned "second" for when you're traveling?
[02:23] <pleia2> hehe
[02:23] <DonkeyHotei> Roguehorse: how 'bout he.net as a venue?
[02:25] <Roguehorse> I think we probably could...I would have to ask first (obviously)
[02:26] <DonkeyHotei> another possibility might be noisebridge
[02:28] <pleia2> I stopped doing them there because the feedback wasn't great (venue was hot, dirty)
[02:28] <pleia2> but it's been a while since I've been
[02:29] <pleia2> citizenspace.us has offered us space, and we can always ask Mozilla or AdRoll again
[02:30] <pleia2> so I think we have a lot of options in SF, just need folks to coordinate something
[02:30] <Roguehorse> ooh...I'd like to look inside Mozilla, that would be cool
[02:31] <pleia2> they have a pretty cool community space at their office on the Embarcadero
[02:31] <Roguehorse> nice
[02:31] <pleia2> I reached out to them for our 14.04 party, but they took forever to reply so I gave up on them for that event, but have since been promised prompter replies ;)
[02:32] <pleia2> so I'm happy to put folks in touch as needed, even if I can't attend myself
[02:32] <Roguehorse> well, between parenting, school, eblug and working with Grant on SFD - I'm pretty tapped
[02:33] <nhaines> Roguehorse: Definitely better to pace yourself.  :)
[02:33] <Roguehorse> nhaines: I like to be community active but it's not fair to the wife for me to be gone all the time ya know?
[02:35] <nhaines> Roguehorse: or the kids.
[02:35] <nhaines> Although we always made SCALE a family event.  :)
[02:35] <eps> SCALE 13x info available at http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale13x -- it's scheduled for *four* days this time.
[02:35] <darthrobot`> Title: [SCALE 13x | scale13x]
[02:36] <pleia2> eps: wow :)
[02:36] <Roguehorse> yeah, he wants to come with Daddy but he gets boired real easy
[02:36] <Roguehorse> still owrking on that
[02:36] <Roguehorse> :-( fat fingers
[02:36] <nhaines> Aw.  :)  Well, nothing a 3DS can't fix once he's participated a bit.
[02:37] <pleia2> it's ok, I bring my 3DS too
[02:37] <pleia2> ;)
[02:37] <Roguehorse> we'll see, it's almost time to start bringing him too
[02:38] <nhaines> pleia2: StreetPass tags!  \o/
[02:38] <pleia2> \o/
[02:38] <Roguehorse> ???
[02:39] <pleia2> 3DS speak
[02:39] <pleia2> ok, anything else?
[02:39] <Roguehorse> Ah
[02:40] <eps> Planning for SCALE?
[02:41] <pleia2> crickets
[02:41] <Roguehorse> Yeah, think it was just those two topics
[02:41] <eps> Put it on a future agenda. ;-)
[02:41] <DonkeyHotei> scale does take planning
[02:43] <pleia2> eps: wfm
[02:43] <pleia2> next meeting we should also chat about leadership elections for the coming year too
[02:43] <pleia2> but I think that's it for tonight :)
[02:44] <pleia2> thanks all
