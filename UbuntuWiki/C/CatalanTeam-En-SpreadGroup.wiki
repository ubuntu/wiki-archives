==== Ubuntu courses in Sant Cugat ====

We have got a classrom with seven computers which you can have it at your disposal. The only limitation is the people that can/want to give the course. People wanting to give a course should announce it: what will it be about, timetable and the price. We also have bigger classrooms that can be used for lectures although, in this case, there is only one computer for the projector, if needed.

About dates, it is on your own. It can be an specific one or you can plan periodic. The only condition is to have people attending. We promote quarterly courses where, if you want, can attend.

Do not forget to take a look at our <nowiki>[[http://atzusac.netfast.org|web page]]</nowiki>. At the courses offering there is a long list focused to fit almost all audiences.

Anybody willing to give a course can announce it here and we will talk about it.
