=== Contributions ===

==== Ubuntu Manual Project (UMP) ====

I am a keen participant in the <nowiki>[[http://ubuntu-manual.org|Ubuntu Manual Project]]</nowiki>. I  can usually be found fixing bugs, editing text, translating (UK English) or helping out in the <nowiki>[[irc:--irc.freenode.net-#ubuntu-manual|#ubuntu-manual]]</nowiki> IRC channel on Freenode.

So far I have worked on two releases of the manual and I look for forward to continuing this for the foreseeable future. Hopefully we can make the manual the best it can possibly be.

With the Lucid release of the manual, I took responsibility for ensuring that bugs were fixed and that the manual was ready for release as per the release schedule. I have also scheduled meetings and send out information to the mailing list.

I have updated the wiki with missing information and helped make information easier to find.

==== Ubuntu One Music Store ====
I have beta tested the music store before it was released and will continue as the project progresses into future releases. I have logged several bugs, and I have also remotely participated in the project at the Lucid UDS. I have also had discussions with various people on the team about future enhancements.

=== Advocating Ubuntu ===

I can always be found promoting the use of Ubuntu. Either at my place of work or to anybody that will listen. I have also managed to get Ubuntu to be the distribution of choice for my company's website.

I have also installed Ubuntu on various peoples computers as a better and more secure alternative to the more traditional operating systems ;)

==== Ubuntu Developer Summit ====

Hopefully one day there will be a summit in London or the United Kingdom. I would love to go. I have remotely participated in a some Ubuntu One meetings for UDS-M.

=== My Future ===

* Continue helping out wherever possible with the Ubuntu Manual Project.
* Continue to learn more skills so that I can help out  help out with software projects
* Alpha and Beta test upcoming releases, report and triage bugs
* Make Ubuntu the best it can be!
* Maybe one day work for Canonical.

=== Aside from Ubuntu ===

When I'm not helping the community, I'm usually reading books, listening to music, designing something or being the sound engineer in my church!
