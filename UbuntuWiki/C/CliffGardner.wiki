=== About Me ===

I was first introduced to Linux in high school and worked in Redhat 7 in our Computer Systems Technology class.  Ubuntu was later introduced to me by a colleague and friend at HP.  I have used Macintosh OS X and Windows extensively but neither of them can compare to Ubuntu IMO.  I am currently using Ubuntu as my primary OS on my home computers and running a dual-boot on my work laptop.  I continue to let interested parties know about Ubuntu.  I am experienced in web design and W3 standards and am currently learning Java.

==== Socially ====

I am in a committed long term relationship and enjoy spending what little free time I have with my girlfriend.  I am constantly listening to music on Sirius or Pandora when I am at a PC and love film.  

==== Professionally ====

I am a Customer Solutions Center Supervisor at Hewlett-Packard in Kentucky.  I previously worked in a business analyst role developing and managing knowledge and technical documentation for up to 300 employees.  I was also involved in SharePoint development and maintenance.   

HP has a very large and open UNIX/Linux profession group that I would love to move into down the road in my career.  I have recently installed Ubuntu 9.10 on my work laptop and am dual-booting with Windows Vista as we have some programs that will not run in Linux or Wine.

=== Ubuntu Participation ===

I currently participate by answering posts in the Ubuntu Forums as well as helping friends and co-workers install and configure Ubuntu on their PCs.  I help answer questions in IRC at #ubuntu.

I recently joined the Documentation Team and am looking for bugs that I can help with.

==== Beginners Team ====

I am not a member of the Beginners Team yet but I am hopeful and want to help new Ubuntu users transition from Windows and Mac.   I am currently in the process of joining the team and am a padawan for <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/cprofitt|cprofitt]]</nowiki>.

I wish to join this team because I have seen how much I have been able to learn and how much I prefer Ubuntu to any other OS I have used.  I aim to become a team member by August 2010.

==== Local Community Team ====

I have recently joined the Ubuntu Kentucky LoCo Team and am looking to become more involved ASAP.  I have joined the mailing list and will be attending the next team meeting. Our LoCo team has essentially (if not fully) migrated to the logcal LUG, <nowiki>[[http://bglug.net|BGLUG]]</nowiki>.

2.  Continue to post in support sections of the Ubuntu forums 
3.  Continue to get Friends and Colleagues trying Ubuntu
