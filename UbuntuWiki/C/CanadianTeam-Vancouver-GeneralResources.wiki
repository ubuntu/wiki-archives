Ubuntu Vancouver is constantly looking for '''free''', '''Ubuntu-specific''', '''current''', and '''very-high quality''' materials that will be helpful to our local community in Vancouver. 

The best resources present Ubuntu clearly and concisely. They respect the Ubuntu ethos. In other words, the word "Dummy", "newbie" or other derogatory language shouldn't appear anywhere in the book. In the world of Ubuntu, every person is a member of the community and has equal standing.

This is our current list.
