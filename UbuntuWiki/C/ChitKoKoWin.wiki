I met Chit Ko Ko Win in Myanmar in March 2013 when I was visiting the country and doing a couple of talks there on Ubuntu Touch. I was very impressed by the work he and the whole Ubuntu-MM team do - they have a space in Yangon where they teach people how to use Ubuntu, they travel around the country holding workshops and lectures on Ubuntu to hundreds and sometimes thousands of people at a time, and they are even talking to the government and council leaders of Yangon about changing their systems to Ubuntu. Chit Ko Ko Win and the rest of the Ubuntu-MM team also does very valuable work on translating Ubuntu and different apps to native Myanmar language, which has been a huge driver in terms of adoption of Ubuntu in Myanmar. He is a great guy, very helpful and kind, and I fully recommend him to be an Ubuntu Member.
