== Website Design Discussion ==

Regardless of what engine we use as the backend to our new site, we'd like to make our site design something that stands out while being identifiable with Ubuntu.

==== Other LoCo sites ====

First off, here's the state of the art as far as other LoCo sites at the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LoCoTeamList|LoCo Team List]]</nowiki>.

Many of the sites fall into the category of clones of various ubuntu.com or Ubuntu wiki styles past and present. Please take a look at a few of the sites and let us know what you like or don't like about the sites on the <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-us-ca|Mailing List]]</nowiki>

==== Official Design Guidelines ====

Canonical has a design blog with some technical information about exact colors and other layout guidelines:

==== Our Designs ====

If you have an idea for a design, feel free to link to a mockup here. It doesn't even have to be HTML, if you want to draw something in GIMP or Inkscape and post an image up here then those of us that know how can use it in the design process.
