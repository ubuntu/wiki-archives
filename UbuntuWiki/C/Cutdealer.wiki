Hi :)
I'm a 20 years old student, learning Geography in Paris I University (France).
I know Ubuntu for some times, but I'm really using it for the 6.10 Release (Edgy).

My participation to Ubuntu is small, and mostly active in translating the UWN in French, helping the UWN Translation Team : <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~lhu]]</nowiki>

If you're french-speaking, join us there ;)
