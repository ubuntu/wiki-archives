__TOC__

* Auto registration - registers you as a linux user at http://counter.li.org/ and as an ubuntu user at http://ubuntucounter.geekosophical.net/ (if your consent is given)

* '''Monodevelop updates'''. Mono is being something really important in gnome (example: right now tomboy is officialy included in gnome 2.16). The changes in each new version of monodevelop are really important and the mono installer offered by the mono-project works only for x86. It would be really a good thing having monodevelop more oft updated.

* Add a line like "remove the cd from the cd-rom and press ENTER to reboot" (as in Dapper live-cd), now it just shows a blinking white box.
