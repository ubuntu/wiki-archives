=== Testimonials ===

==== Alvaro Olivares Santiago ====
Actualmente Cristian es un pilar fundamental dentro de la Comunidad Ubuntu-cl, su liderazgo ha sido determinante tanto en el desarrollo de los nuevos proyectos emprendidos por nuestra comunidad (Difusión, Fuch, Rediseño de la Web, etc); como en el fortalecimiento de sus instituciones base (Concilio, Grupos de Trabajo, Equipos de participación en actividades presenciales, etc).

En cuanto a su persona, Cristian es un fiel representante de lo que significa vivir la filosofía ubuntu, cada una de sus responsabilidades las asume como un aporte a la comunidad sin un afán de figuración, ni de ambición de ningún tipo; simplemente observa una necesidad y si cree que él es la persona idónea para hacerlo, toma la labor tratando de cumplirla de la mejor manera posible.

AlvaroOlivares Miembro del Concilio de Ubuntu-cl

==== Miguel Ruiz ====
I support this application because Cristian represents in a good way the Ubuntu philosophy. He has been an important part of our community since he became part of it. He wants to improve our community in many ways, so he is always facing new challenges and responsibilities within our LoCo Team.

As Ubuntu Member, I think that Cristian would be a good example or model to follow in our country. He can help us to spread the word about Ubuntu, Linux, Free Software and Open Source. Also as a former LoCo contact, I have to say that Cristian is doing a very good job.

MiguelRuiz, Ubuntu Chile Council / Ubuntu Member

==== Fefa Morales ====
Cristian guided me so i can begin my membership in the comunity, teaching me how to sign the code of conduct.

During the time that I have been at the expense of the group marketing with alvaro, cristian has been very cooperator, working with him it's been a very nice experience.
He's always happy to help anybody who need some help with anything in the comunity no matter how little they know about ubuntu he is alway there.

<nowiki>[[FernandaMorales|fefa]]</nowiki>  Marketing management

==== Patricio Gonzalez ====
Since Cristian belongs to the Ubuntu Chile LoCo Team, his contributions never ended. He is always ready to help someone, to  propose an idea, to execute an idea, etc. He is one of the few i know who really live the Ubuntu philosophy. 

<nowiki>[[PatricioGonzalez]]</nowiki> Ubuntu Chile.

==== Pedro Villavicencio ====

Cristian has been working on the Ubuntu Chilean Community for a few years, the energy and passion he's providing to the community is truly admirable and probably without his support things like the mentoring program there wouldn't be possible, he's also helping *quite* a lot on organizing loco events like bug jams, meetings, etc and he's also giving a bunch of Ubuntu talks at free software events here in Chile, also, Cristian is part of the Chilean Council and our LoCo Contact. And when he have some free time also contribute to the website and the marketing team. I strongly recommend him to be an Ubuntu Member he's really a rockstar.

==== Daniel Galleguillos ====

Cristian is a fundamental part of the Ubuntu Chilean community is an active member in various events to promote and develop activities related to Ubuntu. Importantly, Cristian is a person very committed to their function and position within the community, always helping and guiding positively to those who need it and I'm sure that will always deliver the best of for the good of the community of Ubuntu.

==== Carlos Cuevas ====

Cristian's work is fundamental in our team, as he collaborates with several people in the community. He is actively involved in the integration of new members in the Chilean team and coordinates several of the tasks that we developed as a local community. One of his qualities is his ability to motivate others to work in our team.

CarlosCuevas, Ubuntu Chile Council.
