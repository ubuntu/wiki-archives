__TOC__

My name is Carlos Vinicius, I'm a brazilian "geek" and new in the GNU/linux world. Before I was a Mac user and Windows and decided to migrate completely (no dual boot) there is exactly one 6 months. I am not an IT guy, I am a law student and intend to become prosecutor. But always loved technology.
