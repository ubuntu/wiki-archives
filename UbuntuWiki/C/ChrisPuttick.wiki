__TOC__

Otherwise loitering around the Internet as "putt1ck", I'm a longtime web user, who one day hopes to be a real developer/hacker of Python or something else cool :-), but is currently a techie manager type. Recent Ubuntu adopter (previously SuSE but if Novell "get it" I'm pretty certain Novell UK don't...), both privately and at my place of work, which is Oxford Archaeology (more information about them at http://thehumanjourney.net).

I contribute where I can, and have a convincing line in arguments based on economics, politics and social studies that show why open source has to be the next dominant software player...
