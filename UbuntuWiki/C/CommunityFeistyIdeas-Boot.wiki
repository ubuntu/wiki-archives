** AoE: add the possibility to boot from an Ata-Over-Ethernet root besides the present options (Local and NFS). AoE is far more performant than NFS; "Storage Area Network" solutions are now coming to the SO/HO and no longer only a solution for the cluster/server domain. The scripts in the initramfs are easily expanded to do this and the AoE kernel module is already present there (Edgy). The only problem seems to be the kernel module being too old and possibly incompatible with the "vblade" server that is bundled (in Edgy)... see <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.17/+bug/75179|"bug 75179"]]</nowiki>.
