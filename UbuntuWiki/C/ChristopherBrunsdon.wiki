__TOC__

I'm a PHP developer for a mobile value-added service provider and WASP in South Africa with connectivity into other African regions.

My core PHP development is done using the Symfony framework and PostgreSQL.

=== Current non-work related projects ===

I'm currently working on a script for my Neotel device - this is a CDMA 800 EVDO Deskphone. This is South Africas second landline operator and is growing in popularity within the IT and LINUX community. The device is rather limited and currently only has Windows drivers.

Getting it too work under Linux is achieved via wvdial. The device has one vice in that it hangs up and requires power cycling. I have done this through a script which is still much work in progress...
