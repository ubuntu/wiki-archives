1. SCaLE Planning!
** <nowiki>[[http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale6x/images/maps/expo_floor_map.png | Floor Map]]</nowiki> Our booth for SCaLE will most likely remain this year as #31, as corners are very beneficial.
** With the advent of new, improved CD cases with the LoCo's contact info, we hope to give out fewer business cards, however, we should have a healthy supply just in case...
** It's in 10 weeks! We need to start getting ready!
1. December 28 meeting?
** Discussion on whether to cancel a meeting on the 28th for holiday reasons will be moved to the list (It was canceled)
1. UDS recap (Not previously on the agenda)
** The Jaunty Ubuntu Developer's Summit (UDS) took place at the Google campus in Mountain View from Monday December 8, 2008 to Friday December 12, 2008 <nowiki>[[http://summit.ubuntu.com/uds-jaunty/|Schedule]]</nowiki> | <nowiki>[[http://videos.ubuntu.com/uds/jaunty|Videos]]</nowiki>
** For increased LoCo involvement to share best practices, there might be a "LoCo weekend" similar to "Open Week" for LoCos around the world to collaborate and share their ideas to spread Ubuntu even further.
1. Case badges (Also not really on the agenda, but tangentially brought up)
** We still have 'em!

==== Sunday, November 30th, 2008 ====
No meeting due to holiday.

1. Release Party Recaps
** The release party at Chapman was a success. Nine people, dinner, games, and a lecture on Electrical / Computer Engineering. However, we haven't had any information on Northern California parties.
1. SCaLE -- Begin Planning?
** SCaLE 7x will be at the LAX Westin Hotel on the Feb 20-22 weekend. We're looking for volunteers to help out on the floor, or to lend demo computers. Monitors are not required, but preferred. If you can't bring a computer, there will be a wiki page of other smaller but still useful things to do in the future.
1. Two Point Oh Silliness (Or, How I learned to stop  worrying and love micro blogging)
** And also a <nowiki>[[http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=33733199182|Facebook]]</nowiki>
** An <nowiki>[[http://identi.ca|identi.ca]]</nowiki> channel is in the works.
** However, these lines of communication should not be substituted for the mailing list. The mailing list should be where all major discussions regarding the LoCo team should take place. These will probably be used for communicating and announcing before and during events.
** Discussion regarding further social networking and other new communities has been tabled and moved to the mailing list for the time being.
1. Ubuntu US Meeting moved (to 6pm, Dec 9)
** Self-explanatory
1. Upcoming Meetings around Holidays (Nov 30th and Thanksgiving?  Dec 28 and Christmas?)
** The meeting on November 30th may be shortened or removed depending on the size of the Agenda on the week before (November 23). We'll decide what to do on the 28th when that time comes.

1. Feisty Fawn is now unsupported

  a. Presentation: Good slides prepared, working on recording video/audio for the future (put recordings on the web!)
  a. Flannel and nhaines took turns presenting on each slide
  a. For the future: cut down on the amount of text on the slides, put more images/diagrams/etc; bring copies of all the various ISOs (including alternate, different flavors, etc.); maybe attend a prior meeting and scope out the audience's experience level
1. Wiki site One-A-Week
  a. Several CaliforniaTeam pages need to be updated frequently, and aren't; if people made one edit a week, we'd be able to keep on top of it.

  a. Yay!

==== Sunday, May 18th, 2008 ====

<nowiki>[[CaliforniaTeam-Meetings-08May04]]</nowiki>
1. CSULB Installfest review
  a. Flannel and nhaines went on the radio the week before to promote it
  a. Venue was changed at the last minute. About 60 people turned up to watch Revolution OS
  a. Yasumoto and nhaines spoke after the movie about Ubuntu
  a. Nobody actually installed Ubuntu at the event, but lots of CDs got taken
  a. Pictures: http://www.flickr.com/photos/nathanhaines/sets/72157604596346722/
  a. Would have been nice to have more CDs and a banner
1. Hardy Party
  a. Saturday, May 10th
  a. Somewhere near Irvine at a Chinese restaurant
  a. Discussion moved to mailing list

==== Sunday, April 20th, 2008 ====
<nowiki>[[CaliforniaTeam-Meetings-08April20]]</nowiki>
1. CSU Long Beach InstallFest
  a. It's on Wednesday!
  a. Anyone who hasn't already should let Flannel know they're going so he can organize parking permits.
  a. Flyer: http://art110.wikispaces.com/Installfest
  a. nhaines is going to be presenting. He'll be a little late, but should be there before the movie's over, so it's okay. Flannel is going too, and will also be late.
1. Hardy flavor changes
  a. Mythbuntu and Ubuntu Studio are now official flavors of Ubuntu.  There are mythbuntu-desktop and ubuntustudio-desktop packages in universe.
  a. Edubuntu is now an addon to existing K/X/Ubuntu installations, not a separate installer. There are metapackages for different age groups.
   i. LTSP is now an option in the normal alternate installer, so it's not an Edubuntu-only thing now.
  a. Kubuntu 8.04
   i. ''Not'' an LTS (unlike Ubuntu and Xubuntu 8.04).
   i. KDE4 "remix" for testing Hardy. The official release uses KDE3, though.
   i. The upgrade path for Kubuntu 8.04 is LTS-like (i.e., you can upgrade to it from an older LTS release), even though it isn't an LTS.
   i. Reason for lack of LTS is the KDE3 to KDE4 change: KDE4 isn't ready for LTS, and the Kubuntu team don't want to support KDE3 for the LTS time period.
1. Hardy party
  a. No offers for locations yet, except CSULB. A couple of LUG meetups were mentioned on the mailing list.
  a. Consider making it more pary-oriented than installfest-oriented, considering the installfest at CSULB is close to it.
  a. Discussion moved to the mailing list.
1. Team Reports
  a. Monthly report on the wiki containing a summary of what we've done that month
  a. We're just contributing to the US teams report, so we don't have to make one up every month.
  a. Keeping up with these will help us keep track of stuff on the wiki anyway, which is nice.
1. Lug Radio Live Recap
  a. Photos: http://www.flickr.com/photos/nathanhaines/sets/72157604566288815/
  a. Very laid back. Lots of interest on Sunday. Everyone got an Ubuntu 7.10 Desktop CD in their swag bag. 
  a. We gave out 6 Ubuntu 8.04 Beta CDs, 1 Kubuntu CD plus several official ones donated by the KDE booth, 5 Edubuntu CDs, and 3 Xubuntu CDs. We also received 3 Ubuntu 7.10 Desktop CDs from people who didn't need theirs, 16 Dapper CDs, and the KDE booth donated 61 Kubuntu 7.10 Desktop CDs.
  a. nhaines gave a 5 minute presentation during the "Gong-A-Thon": http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hZ2kscPlug
  a. Jorge Castro, the External Projects Manager for Canonical, came by and thought the booth was good. Sun's Open Solaris demo was running Ubuntu.
  a. Someone was unhappy with the unofficial, non-pressed CDs: "If you don't start to step up and perform, other people will."

==== Sunday, April 6th, 2008 ====
<nowiki>[[CaliforniaTeam-Meetings-08April06]]</nowiki>
1. <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-us-ca/2008-March/000206.html|Gmane Archiving]]</nowiki>: should email addresses be obfuscated?
  a. nhaines pointed out that lists.ubuntu.com obfuscates addresses a little, so we should set gmane to do it too. Everyone else agrees (after discussing what exactly the options are).
1. <nowiki>[[http://www.lugradio.org/live/USA2008/start|LUG Radio Live 2008]]</nowiki>
  a. At the Metreon in SF on Apr 12-13
  a. nhaines will be there and offered to talk to any northern CA people who wanted to know more about the Lo``Co.
  a. Lo``Co representation in northern California is thin, would be good to reach out
  a. Registration is only $10 for the entire weekend and includes goody bags and light lunches
1. CSU Long Beach Install``Fest
  a. Flyer: http://art110.wikispaces.com/installfest
  a. Wednesday 23rd. Schedule: 6pm show Revolution OS; 7pm Linux OS "demo" plus overview of software available; 7:30 - 8pm Install``Fest on stage. Installs in the lobby starting at 6pm for people who come to the event ready to install.
  a. Get names of people for parking to Flannel by the 20th

==== Sunday, March 23rd, 2008 ====
No meeting due to holiday.

==== Sunday, March 9th, 2008 ====
<nowiki>[[CaliforniaTeam-Meetings-08March09]]</nowiki>
1. CSULB installfest
  a. Date set! Wed April 23
  a. Lots of people at CSULB don't know what Ubuntu/Linux are, or are scared of it, so this will also be an advocacy/information session
  a. Possible schedule: Revolution OS 6-7, demo Ubuntu from 7 to 7:30. Install from 6 - 10 in the lobby
  a. Info page: http://art110.wikispaces.com/installfest
  a. Available resources: 6 power strips, net connection, 4 port router, probably tables, okay wifi signal
  a. sn9 suggested Digital Tipping Point instead of Revolution OS, but DTP isn't finished yet so people preferred Revolution OS.
  a. Advertising: 8.5x11 flyers, announcements in Computer Science classes, story in school newspaper, 60 sec spot for KBCH Radio
  a. Moved further discussion of advertising etc. to mailing list
1. LUG Radio Booth
  a. April 12-13 at the Metreon in San Francisco. More info at http://www.lugradio.org/live/USA2008/start
  a. Jono Bacon is one of the founders, and also an Ubuntu community manager. He asked nhaines if our LoCo could do a booth there. 
  a. Keep an eye on the wiki and mailing list for more info!
1. Hardy Installfest
  a. Probably some time in May
  a. Will have one in the south, but would like to have a northern one too. Possibly Bay Area? Davis? Another university up there?
1. Ubuntu-California Membership
  a. LoCos are primarily advocacy groups, not social groups, so it'd be nice if most of the people in this LoCo were active.
  a. Lots of people signed up for the Launchpad group but are inactive.
  a. Concept of membership needs to be fleshed out more (on the mailing list), but is something to think about.
1. gmane.org
  a. Should email addresses be obscured in gmane?
  a. Can import old history to gmane if it's in mbox format

==== Sunday, February 24th, 2008 ====
<nowiki>[[CaliforniaTeam-Meetings-08February24]]</nowiki>
1. <nowiki>[[CaliforniaTeam-Projects-Scale6x|SCaLE6x]]</nowiki>
  a. At booth: three Ubuntu computers, Canonical-provided swag
  a. Estimate about 100-125 CDs given out
  a. What went well?
   i. Good location: a little far from the middle, but the corner was good because we could drop the outer wall and put up a table (felt accessible and inviting)
   i. Good booth volunteers! Show was friendly and relaxed, the people at the booth were welcoming, people had a good time (Canonical swag helped!)
   i. People were drawn to the CDs, stickers, and the big monitor
   i. None of the booth people insulted other distros/OSes (yay!)
   i. Harkonen's business cards were good! Handed them out with the CDs
  a. What didn't?
   i. Need to burn CDs in advance! We had trouble keeping up with demand.
   i. People thought we were official representatives (nhaines said this isn't a problem)
   i. Didn't have a banner because of time constraints
   i. Booth people disappeared frequently; maybe have an actual schedule next time?
  a. Pictures from SCaLE! http://www.flickr.com/groups/socallinuxexpo/
1. April Installfest at CSULB
  a. Screen Revolution OS from 6-7pm and then installfest from 7 to 10pm
  a. April 16, 23 or 30: between Spring Break and finals
  a. Advertising for it: mention that you can dual-boot, that there are good tools for Ubuntu (GIMP, Inkscape, Krita, Scribus...)

==== Sunday, February 10th, 2008 ====
No meeting due to SCaLE.

==== Sunday, January 27th, 2008 ====
<nowiki>[[CaliforniaTeam-Meetings-08January27]]</nowiki>
1. IRC channel renaming
  a. The IRC council has decided that US state LoCo teams must use the #ubuntu-us-NN (where NN is the state regioncode) format for their channel names
  a. Several people think that switching from #ubuntu-california to #ubuntu-us-ca is a bad idea.
   i. It looks too formal.
   i. It makes state LoCo teams look like subteams of the US LoCo team, which they're not.
  a. Need to decide whether to put #ubuntu-california or #ubuntu-us-ca on the SCaLE business cards that harkonen is planning to make. He's not around, so the matter's deferred.
1. <nowiki>[[CaliforniaTeam-Projects-Scale6x|SCaLE6x]]</nowiki>
  a. Planned resources: Four computers for demos, Canonical's conference pack, wifi router
   i. Clarified that demo computers aren't just for Compiz and will be available to demo the rest of Ubuntu too.
