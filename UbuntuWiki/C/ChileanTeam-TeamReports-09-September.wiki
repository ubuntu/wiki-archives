In this month we celebrate the independence day ("Fiestas Patrias") and we enjoy dancing and drinking, but Ubuntu doesn't sleep and we have the following activities:

* IRC Monthly Meeting (September 15th, #ubuntu-cl). The meeting page with the log is <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ChileanTeam/Reuniones/2009-09-15|here]]</nowiki>.
* Freedom Software Day (September 26th, Talca).
