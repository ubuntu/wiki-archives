 03:04:13 <nhaines> Hi everyone!  It's time for our biweekly LoCo meeting here in sunny California!
 03:04:23 <nhaines> And by "sunny" I mean "flooded."
 03:04:38 <nhaines> Tonight's agenda is available here and is currently empty: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CaliforniaTeam/Meetings/17January22
 03:04:38 <darthrobot`> Title: [CaliforniaTeam/Meetings/17January22 - Ubuntu Wiki]
 03:04:49 <pleia2> so soggy
 03:05:53 <nhaines> On the bright side, the value of waterfront property is on the rise, as is the water.  Unfortunately, the waterfront property itself isn't moving, just the water.  :)
 03:06:03 <nhaines> #topic Upcoming events
 03:06:34 <nhaines> UbuCon Summit and SCALE 15X are coming up on March 2nd-5th!
 03:06:49 <pleia2> \o/
 03:07:31 <nhaines> The call for papers is still open, and Richard and I are meeting to talk about what we have so far on Monday.  http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/15x/cfp if you'd like to give a talk about Ubuntu!  :)
 03:07:31 <darthrobot`> Title: [CFP | SCALE 15x]
 03:08:09 <nhaines> If you'd like to visit UbuCon as an attendee, you can register at http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/ and should definitely use the promo code "UBNTU" for 50% off a full expo pass!
 03:08:09 <darthrobot`> [R: www.socallinuxexpo.org] Title: [SCALE 15x | 15x]
 03:08:57 <nhaines> And if you'd like to volunteer to help out at the Ubuntu booth at SCALE, you can get a free SCALE pass by signing up for at least one shift here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CaliforniaTeam/Projects/Scale15x
 03:08:57 <darthrobot`> Title: [CaliforniaTeam/Projects/Scale15x - Ubuntu Wiki]
 03:09:23 <nhaines> We plan to get ubucon.org updated by the first of the month, so stay tuned.
 03:09:29 <nhaines> Any other upcoming events?
 03:09:34 <pleia2> nothing from me
 03:09:52 <pleia2> nhaines: will the second day have scheduled presentations, or just be unconferencey?
 03:10:01 * pleia2 has an idea for a talk, but can't participate on Thursday
 03:10:57 <nhaines> pleia2: looks like we're mostly going to be unconferency, but we will also give talks scheduling priority if we have the space.
 03:11:06 <pleia2> ok
 03:11:36 <pleia2> well, I'll submit anyway and see what happens :)
 03:11:46 <nhaines> Oh, and Softpedia picked up the call for papers off my blog, so I sent them the full-resolution group photo from last year!  http://linux.softpedia.com/blog/ubucon-summit-at-scale-15x-to-take-place-march-2-3-in-pasadena-california-512080.shtml

 03:12:00 <nhaines> #topic Announcements
 03:12:06 <nhaines> Any other announcements this week?
 03:14:17 <nhaines> Doesn't look like it.  :)
 03:14:24 <nhaines> #topic Agenda
 03:14:36 <nhaines> There are no agenda items for this meeting.
 03:14:48 <nhaines> #topic Other business
 03:15:00 <pleia2> nothing from me here either
 03:15:31 <nhaines> My sit down with the leadership document got pushed to next week, but I basically know how I think I want to amend things, so it should go pretty quickly.
 03:15:37 <pleia2> folks may have noticed, other things have taken priority for me lately and I haven't been able to host Ubuntu Hours and Debian Dinners in SF recently
 03:15:47 <pleia2> thanks nhaines
 03:16:05 <nhaines> pleia2: have others picked up either of those activities?
 03:17:25 <pleia2> no, I've asked around but no bites so far
 03:17:48 <nhaines> Ubuntu Hours are fun and really easy to host!
 03:18:14 <nhaines> They're great ways to get used to organizing events, if anyone is thinking about taking pleia2 up on those events, or wants to star their own locally!
 03:19:46 <nhaines> pleia2: thanks for organizing those for so long!  I hope you can get back to them again soon.  :)
 03:20:02 <pleia2> me too :)
 03:21:05 <nhaines> pleia2: well, you can pretend the UbuCon party is like an Ubuntu Hour, except with more free alcohol.  :)
 03:21:26 <nhaines> Alrighty, I think that's it for this week.
 03:21:27 <pleia2> lol
 03:21:33 <pleia2> thanks for chairing, nhaines :)
 03:22:04 <nhaines> Next meeting is February 5th!
