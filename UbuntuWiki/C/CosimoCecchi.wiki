Hi, my name is Cosimo Cecchi, I'm an italian guy and I'm 21 years old. I've been using Linux for about two years and Ubuntu for some months. I think that Ubuntu succeeds in providing the most easy and exciting Linux desktop experience and I'll be very proud of spreading it, as I'm already doing among my friends.
I'm a member of <nowiki>[[http://www.lilik.it|LILiK]]</nowiki>, a lab of free computing manteined by some engineering students at the University of Florence. We also have <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/people/lilik|our launchpad team]]</nowiki>.
