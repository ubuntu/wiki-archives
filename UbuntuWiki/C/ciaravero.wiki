== About Me ==
I'm a 21 year old female from the United States.

I have been using Ubuntu since 10.04, and I've been using it as my primary OS since 11.04. Ubuntu is my desktop distro of choice, because it takes something that I already have great respect for (Debian Testing), and makes it more accessible/user-friendly.

I don't have much money, which means that I perpetually have old or low-end hardware. As a result, I've found my way over to LXDE, and Lubuntu, in particular.

'''Why I'm Here'''
I'm here for many reasons, but most of them boil down to guilt. Guilt of taking and taking, but not having given back to the community.

Side Note: opensource software comes with an emotional price tag. If I were just purchasing some proprietary OS, I wouldn't have to deal with all these emotions (i.e. belonging, gratitude, guilt).

=== Contributions to the Ubuntu Community ===
* '''<nowiki>[[http://lubuntusearch.blogspot.com/|Lubuntu Search]]</nowiki>''': I've been using <nowiki>[[http://www.googlubuntu.com/|Googl Ubuntu]]</nowiki>, for a while now, but I felt compelled to tailor a CSE for Lubuntu. I'm about to notify the facebook group to see if someone there thinks I violated one of Canonical's trademarks. (Or if I'm in violation of anything else.)
* '''Lubuntu Testing/QA''': Woo hoo! I'll start with 12.10. So far I've just been reading the mailing lists, and I didn't realize how time-consuming it would be. In preparation, I've been pouring over the docs.
* '''Community Documentation''': Hardware Compatibility
** <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AspireOne|Acer Aspire One]]</nowiki> - I've been helping to update/organize the Acer Aspire One pages
** <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AspireOneAOD250|Aspire One D250]]</nowiki> (aka eMachines eM250, Acer Aspire One KAV60, eMachines KAV60) - I own this model, and I'll be using it when testing Lubuntu. I expect to keep this page maintained.

=== Goals & Plans ===
* '''Lubuntu Testing/QA''': x86
** <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/Netbooks/AcerAspireOne|/Testing/Netbooks/AcerAspireOne]]</nowiki> - I plan to update this.
** <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AcerAspireOne|/AcerAspireOne]]</nowiki> - I plan to update this (or maybe delete it).
