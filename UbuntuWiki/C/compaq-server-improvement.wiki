__TOC__

better instilation support for older compaq servers and compaq servers in general. 
on older compaq servers (eg. proliant 7000) ubuntu will not recognise the scsi/raid controllers. (eg. Smart Array 3100ES Controller) and will therefore not install; or in some cases not even boot into the text based installer or live cd.  

this would not take much effort to fix.

eg. have an optional kernel with scsi/raid drivers built in that can be selected prior to starting the installer.
