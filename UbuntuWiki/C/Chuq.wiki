__TOC__

Hi there.  I am Chuq, I'm a long time Linux/OSS advocate living in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia.

Sadly I still use Windows on my desktop ... however I'm getting there, my wife has been using Ubuntu for several years and I'm running pretty much all free/open source software as far as applications go! (OpenOffice, Firefox, Thunderbird, The Gimp)
