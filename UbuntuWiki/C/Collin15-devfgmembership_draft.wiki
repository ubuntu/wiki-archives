__TOC__

The Development FG's mission is to promote general development throughout the Ubuntu community and involve people interested in development in real-world projects. We do not focus upon Ubuntu development specifically, although we do promote it as a "real-life project".

Requirements for joining:

* Know or be learning at least one programming language; More than one is preferred, but not required.
<<BR>>
- Highly valued, but not required:
* Knowing your way around version control systems and bug trackers.

Process for joining:
1. Apply to join the FG at our Launchpad page at https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-beginners-dev
2. You will be appraised by one of the team's officials for your development abilities sometime in the near future after applying, most likely in 24-48 hours, either by IRC or by email (if you want it to be done by email, please make sure you send a message to the team leader).
3. After this appraisal, you will either be added to the team or asked to improve upon an aspect before being added. We will never flatly deny you membership to the team. If at all possible, we will extend an offer of assistance in gaining the requirements you need to join the team.
