=== Summary ===

Currently, you can choose between 3 options: No effects, Main plugins and extra plugins. You cannot choose the specific settings for each plugin through a simple interface (you need to use Gconf). I propose to add an "Advanced settings..." button to Desktop effects tab and link that button to compizconfig-setting-manager, the best tool to configurate compiz. The emerad theme manager should be included here too.

=== Rationale ===

This is needed to  improve the Ubuntu experience. This change will give the user an easy and  powerful tool to manage the compiz settings

=== Use Cases ===

José wants to use a pyramid instead of the cube. He goes to Preferences>Appearence>Desktop Effects and click on the "Advanced" button. He gets the compiz-config-manager and he changes the setting.

John want to use another theme for compiz. He goes to the Desktop Effects tab and click on 

=== UI Changes ===

Simply add 2 buttons to the Desktop Effects tab

=== Assumptions ===

compizconfig-manager and emerald theme manager must be installed.

=== BoF agenda and discussion ===
