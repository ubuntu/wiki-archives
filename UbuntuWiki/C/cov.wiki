My name is Christopher Covington and I'm currently the Benevolent Dictator of the Virginia Tech Linux and Unix Users' Group. I have a long history with Gentoo GNU/Linux but find myself installing (and troubleshooting) Ubuntu on friends' machines increasingly often.

The Engineering Department at Virginia Tech requires tablet PCs. I'd like to help grow a student testing and development community locally to ensure that Ubuntu, the distribution we most often recommend to new users, works flawlessly and compellingly on tablets out of the box.
