I'm Chris - otherwise known as chrisod or COD on the 'Net. I am not the actor.

=== Ubuntu / Linux Community ===

I'm a member of the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/VirginiaTeam | Virginia Team]]</nowiki> and I'm fairly active helping out in the Absolute Beginner's Forum. I'm also an active member of my local LUG at <nowiki>[[http://fredlug.tux.org/|FredLUG]]</nowiki>

=== Computing History ===

At the risk of dating myself...my first computer was an Atari 800XL that I received as a high school graduation present from my parents. After college I bought a PC (probably a 286) and discovered the world of the dial up BBS. That got me through graduate school. I launched my first web page on 12/31/1995. Yes, I spent my New Year's Eve learning HTML. I had an excuse - my wife was 7 months pregnant so we weren't going out :) I first installed Red Hat in 1999 or 2000 and started and stopped with Linux several times before I finally stuck with Ubuntu.
