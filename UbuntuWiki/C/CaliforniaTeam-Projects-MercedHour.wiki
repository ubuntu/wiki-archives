__TOC__

Merced is beginning in Nov, 2021 to host an Ubuntu <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Hour|Hour]]</nowiki> like other <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CaliforniaTeam/Projects/UbuntuHours|team Ubuntu Hour activities]]</nowiki>. We created this page from <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CaliforniaTeam/Projects/UserGroupContacts/|User Group Contacts]]</nowiki> as a low barrier way to get started rather than other recommended methods related to the above links. There is no user group in this area yet but with the two colleges <nowiki>[[https://www.ucmerced.edu/|UC Merced]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[https://www.mccd.edu/|Merced College]]</nowiki> there seems to be ample potential for something like a LUG.

When: Monthly on the third Saturday at 2:00 PM.

Where: ASIP Coffee Roaster Co., 425 W Main St, Merced, CA 95340
