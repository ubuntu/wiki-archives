__TOC__

I'm writing this wiki page to apply for Ubuntu membership.

My launchpad profile is located at https://launchpad.net/people/tortoise

I've been working with the accessibility team over the summer.  My involvement started with the onboard project.  Onboard was a summer of code project for Ubuntu, the goal of which was to write a simple On-Screen-Keyboard that could replace GOK for most of it's use cases but still be relied on to work out of the box without configuration as much as possible.

Post SoC I have submitted various patches:

Adding a quit button to orca http://librarian.launchpad.net/4197494/quitbutton.dpatch

Changed gnome-at-properties dialog to suit orca better, allow launching at apps from dialog and have dialog default to onboard and fall back on GOK.

Ubiquity orca script <nowiki>[[attachment:ubiquity.py]]</nowiki>

I plan on continuing to contribute to Ubuntu in both accessibility and other areas and to attend the UDS at Mountain View in November.
