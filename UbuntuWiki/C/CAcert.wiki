CAcert is a free (gratis, free of charge) root certificate trusted by <nowiki>[[http://wiki.cacert.org/wiki/CacertSites|many sites]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[http://wiki.cacert.org/wiki/InclusionStatus|many distributions and programs]]</nowiki>. There has been <nowiki>[[http://blog.cacert.org/2005/04/4.html|talk about inclusion in ubuntu]]</nowiki> in 2005 in <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDownUnder/BOFs/CACertInclusion|an UbuntuDownUnder BoF]]</nowiki> but ultimately didn't happen.

=== Procedure ===
You can manually install the CAcert root certificate with the following command:

<pre>
sudo apt-get install ca-cacert
</pre>

The file will be installed in 
<pre>
/usr/share/ca-certificates/CAcert/
</pre>

But you need to manually import it. Firefox used to allow the import to start from command line, but now this has to be done in Preferences -> Advanced -> View Certificates.

If you are still getting a message like '''''You have not chosen to trust "Thwate Premium Server CA"''''' you will need to manually copy the SSL Certificate to the ICAClinet directory.
# Go into Firefox → Edit → Preferences → Advanced → View Certificates → Authorities Tab
# Find the missing certificate, e.g. Thwate Premium Server CA
# Export this Certificate to your hard drive somewhere
# Run the following command (''assuming you Exported to your Downloads directory'') to copy the file to the ICAClient directory:   <pre>
cp ~/Downloads/ThawtePremiumServerCA /usr/lib/ICAClient/keystore/cacerts
</pre>
