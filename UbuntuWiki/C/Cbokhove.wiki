__TOC__

I'm a teacher of Computer Studies and Mathematics at St. Michael College in Zaandam. I've been experimenting with moodle for about four years and find it the best Open Source (if not the best in general) LMS available. Especially the community that supports Moodle is a definite plus. I also am projectleader of the Galois project (www.galoisproject.nl), ICT-coördinator and member of the city council (for political party SP) of my residence, the beautiful town Enkhuizen (north of Amsterdam, on the Zuiderzee) Other important occupations are my 4 children and my wife.
