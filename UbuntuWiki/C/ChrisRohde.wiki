== About ==

<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/Icongnomeicu3.png]]</nowiki> I am an accounting clerk / amateur geek at a small real estate investment firm in Florida.

I have been toying with Ubuntu, my first Linux distro, since mid 2006 and switched over to Kubuntu in early 2007. I have not yet figured everything out, but I am gaining ground quickly after so many years of laziness brought on by the competition. I have recently started the Florida LoCo team (see FloridaTeam), and am incredibly happy with the speed with which it has taken off, having already reached almost 100 members in only a few months. I see nothing but good things coming from this team and its members in the future.

I mostly spend my time working on my new kubuntu toys, breaking the system, reinstalling, and all the fun that goes with it. I also try to document what I learn so it might help others at <nowiki>[[http://veritastic.net|veritas/tic]]</nowiki>, and spend a large amount of my time attempting to learn Python as a jumping-off point to understanding other languages as well.

=== Goals ===
<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/IconCalendarOpen.png]]</nowiki> I find that the best way to make sure I follow my goals is to list them, add to them, edit them, worry about them, ad nauseum, until I complete them all in a sad, twisted competition with myself. Strangely enough, by listing and following these goals I may actually complete one of them, becoming a member.
