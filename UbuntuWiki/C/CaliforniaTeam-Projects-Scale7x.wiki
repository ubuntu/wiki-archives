'''Read about our <nowiki>[[CaliforniaTeam-Projects-Scale7x-BugJam|BugJam]]</nowiki>!'''

The Ubuntu California LoCo has been accepted as an exhibitor at the <nowiki>[[http://socallinuxexpo.org/scale7x/|Southern California Linux Expo]]</nowiki>!

SCaLE7x is February 20-22 (Fri-Sun).  The Expo is open Saturday and Sunday, with Friday being reserved for the mini-conferences.  
Doors open at 9am Saturday for setup, and 10am to the general public (10am is also the keynote) <nowiki>[[http://scale7x.socallinuxexpo.org/conference-info/schedules|See Full Schedule]]</nowiki>.  Parking is $14 per day.

We've got a lot going on this year!  The weekend of SCaLE is also the weekend of the next GlobalBugJam, and we'll be participating at SCaLE!  We will have a room where people can go and learn to do bugwork, jam on some bugs, and learn how to run their own bug jam!  We're also hoping to have a few presentations/demonstrations throughout the weekend on various beginners Ubuntu topics.

=== Materials ===
If you think of anything else (large or small) we need, please add it to the list.  If the reason it is needed/wanted isn't obvious, explain the reasoning in the description area.  This should be an all encompassing list, from duct tape to computers to scratch paper.  When in doubt, add it and mention you're unsure in the description.

If you can provide something, please sign your name in the volunteer column (more than one person per item is fine).  If you have anything else to say about it (like, "I'm 60% sure I have one of these") use the comments field.  If you're providing a part of something (a computer but no monitor) make sure you mention that as well.

If you can't figure out the wiki formatting, just add items/comments underneath, and someone else will come wikify it.

Feel free to make any comments/suggestions/additions!
