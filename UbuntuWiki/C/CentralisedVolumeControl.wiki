=== Summary ===
The individual volume of every sound-playing application should be adjustable through the volume-control applet

=== Rationale ===
Right now, every sound playing application manages the volume by itself. There is no central point where one can get an overview over all currently sound-playing applications and their adjustment.

Extending the volume control applet would give the user some centralised control. This could be spiced up by some metadata from the sound playing applications.

=== Use cases ===
Annada would like to tune down the music player while chatting through Ekiga. He knows that he can adjust the global volume, but to tune down a specific application, he has to bring this application to the top and then adjust the volume.

=== Scope ===

=== Design ===

=== Implementation ===
