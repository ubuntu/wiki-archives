__TOC__

I've been on Ubuntu full-time since Hoary Hedgehog in May of 2004.  How time flies...

During the day (and sometimes at night) I work for Sage Software on <nowiki>[[http://www.billingboss.com|Billing Boss]]</nowiki> and other fun projects.

My blog <nowiki>[[http://www.madanalogy|Mad Analogy]]</nowiki> is the best place to find me.

Cheers,

Chuck
