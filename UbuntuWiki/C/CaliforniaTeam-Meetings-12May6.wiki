[02:01] <pleia2> Agenda; https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CaliforniaTeam/Meetings/12May6
[02:01] <pleia2> so first up, UDS starts tomorrow! https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CaliforniaTeam/Projects/UDS-Q
[02:01] <eps> o/
[02:02] <pleia2> we've gotten very good feedback to our public transportation page, so thanks to everyone who helped out there :)
[02:02] <pleia2> eps: I've already given out 3 Clipper cards :)
[02:03] <pleia2> refills are working well
[02:03] <akk> Giving blank clipper cards was a great idea!
[02:03] <akk> And the transit page is excellent too.
[02:03] <eps> they're good for 20 years, so don't toss them
[02:03] <pleia2> indeed!
[02:04] <pleia2> I also mentioned that in my email, people should keep them for their next visit :)
[02:04] <pleia2> anyone have any comments, questions, etc about UDS?
[02:04] <pleia2> I went to the hotel last night and this, nice place, and you can't beat how close it is to bart
[02:04] <akk> Is there a gathering point for ubuntu-cal people? Place to get "I'm a local" badges or offer to help out with anything?
[02:05] <pleia2> akk: nope, it's mostly just "find pleia2"
[02:05] <pleia2> I'll have all of them in my bag
[02:05] <akk> pleia2 is the embodiment of ubuntu-us-ca :)
[02:05] <pleia2> lol
[02:05] <pleia2> I try :)
[02:06] <pleia2> http://summit.ubuntu.com/uds-q/2012-05-07/
[02:06] <jtatum> Hehe
[02:06] <pleia2> is the schedule for tomorrow, as you can see the intro and keynote is at 9AM
[02:06] <pleia2> you'll want to get there a little before that so you can go to registration and get your badge
[02:06] <jdeslip> Is registration only tomorrow?
[02:07] <pleia2> jdeslip: nah, they'll have the table open all week
[02:07] <pleia2> it's also where they'll set up the shop (they bring over goods from the canonical store to sell at UDS, very useful)
[02:08] <pleia2> and you can get any other information you may need by asking the folks there
[02:08] <DonkeyHotei> akk: www.511.org
[02:08] <DonkeyHotei> akk: http://www.511.org
[02:09] <eps> Do we need to register for each session we want to attend? I see participants lists on the schedule.
[02:10] <pleia2> feel free to grab me at UDS if you have questions too, I can usually help, or know someone who does
[02:10] <pleia2> eps: no, you can just show up, the people "registered" are those who are subscribed to the blueprint (that means you'll get emailed each time it's updated throughout the next 6 months)
[02:10] <DarkwingUDS> pleia2: you still here at the hotel?
[02:10] <pleia2> DarkwingUDS: nah, I came home
[02:11] <DarkwingUDS> pleia2: ahhhh. Yeah, I'm up in my room charging my phone. :D
[02:11] <pleia2> :)
[02:11] <pleia2> ok, see those of you who can make it at UDS this week!
[02:11] <pleia2> next topic...
[02:11] <pleia2> Booth at Maker Faire: https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-us-ca/2012-May/001954.html
[02:11] <pleia2> jdeslip: have anything to say about this one?
[02:12] <pleia2> (and yes, we're getting them sorted disk-wise :))
[02:12] <jdeslip> Ya. The maker faire is pretty awesome event. A lot of do-it-yourself type people there. So, I think it is a good audience to show off Linux too
[02:13] <jdeslip> The booth is called "Bay Area Linux Groups" and I inviting people from a few different to come
[02:13] <jdeslip> But, obviously we want a good showing from Ubuntu-CA see that is what people often associated Linux with these days
[02:14] <jdeslip> I should be able to get James, Aaditya and Philip in for free.
[02:14] <jdeslip> I'll send out some details in the next day or so. Please think of cool/crafty things to demo...
[02:15] <DonkeyHotei> eps: you got my e-mail, right?
[02:15] <pleia2> great, thanks jdeslip :)
[02:15] <jdeslip> Ya, I guess that is about it on Maker Faire
[02:15] <eps> DonkeyHotei: haven't checked yet ... I've been out doing errands
[02:16] <pleia2> ok, anyone else have anything?
[02:17] <pleia2> oh! if anyone wants to help me with the tourism night on Wednesday I'd love to have the help :)
[02:17] <pleia2> we're going bart > embarcadero > ferry building > street car to pier 39 > fisherman's wharf > ghirardelli square > cable cars back to powell (probably)
[02:18] <pleia2> grabbing dinner somewhere along the way
[02:18] <jtatum> pleia2: I will ping work and see if I can swing that
[02:18] <eps> Tough call ... that, or the BAD dinner or free pizza and beer
[02:18] <pleia2> jtatum: ok cool, we're planning on leaving Oakland on BART at 7PM, you can meet us anywhere
[02:19] <pleia2> sessions end at 6PM, 7 gives them time to head up to their rooms to wash up/change/relax for a few minutes
[02:19] <pleia2> I can't imagine our group will be more than 20 people, but even handling that will be interesting :)
[02:20] <jledbetter> cool
[02:20] <jtatum> Maybe I can convince jledbetter to join too :)
[02:20]  * pleia2 will be putting together a pretty PDF for the tour tonight
[02:20] <pleia2> yes yes!
[02:21] <jledbetter> Wednesday is hard :(
[02:23] <pleia2> anyone have anything else?
[02:24] <eps> Maybe you can convince UDS attendees to buy Partimus earrings
[02:24] <pleia2> ah yes, I'll be carrying 8 pairs with me!
[02:24] <pleia2> and the business cards for the shop, in case people want to buy later
[02:24] <pleia2> so you're welcome to send people to me if you find anyone who wants a pair
[02:25] <jtatum> Neat!
[02:25] <jledbetter> I dig that they have silver ones now.
[02:25] <pleia2> yeah :)
[02:26] <pleia2> ok, thanks everyone
