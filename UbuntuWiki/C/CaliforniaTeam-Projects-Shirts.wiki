We need to come up with some designs for shirts, so we're collaborating in the same way we did for our <nowiki>[[CaliforniaTeam-Projects-Logo|LoCo logo]]</nowiki>.

These shirts could be designed for a number of possible purposes: general LoCo shirt, release-specific shirts, activity-specific shirts.  Don't hold yourself back.

Here are a few templates if you want to use one: <nowiki>[[attachment:TShirt_Template.svg|T-Shirt]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[attachment:PoloShirt_Template.svg|Polo Shirt]]</nowiki>

Post your ideas here! You can  (in any format) or (if you're not graphically inclined) write a description and someone else can come by and fill in the gaps. Even if you post a picture, don't worry about it being perfect: we can always clean up a final design later.

If you'd like to upload a file directly to the wiki, you can do so on the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CaliforniaTeam/Projects/Shirts?action=AttachFile|Attachment page]]</nowiki>. To link to the attachment on this page, use the syntax <code><nowiki>[[File:filename.png]]</nowiki> </code>. To link to an image hosted elsewhere, use the syntax <code>{{http://example.com/link/to/picture}} </code>. 

== Black CA Logo Design ==
* I took the logo, resized it for the front pocket (2"x2" as I recall) and back of a shirt (7"x7" as I recall) and saved it in tiff file format needed for producing the shirts. Feedback encouraged! Thanks to the provided svg templates here is a similar example to below. -- <nowiki>[[Grantbow]]</nowiki>

* <nowiki>[[attachment:front.tiff|front.tiff]]</nowiki> <nowiki>[[attachment:back.tiff|back.tiff]]</nowiki>

These shirts have become a reality thanks to a generous donation from Ragga Wear! The team now has them in several sizes, as documented in the chart below. Don't be shy, if you're involved with the team contact lyz@ubuntu.com as described in <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-us-ca/2010-April/001163.html|this email]]</nowiki> to have one sent your way.
