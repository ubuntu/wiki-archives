1. <nowiki>[[CaliforniaTeam-Projects-Scale6x|SCaLE]]</nowiki>
   a. Our booth got accepted to SCaLE!
   a. SCaLE is in February, so planning for it will start once the holidays are over.
   a. Demo boxes (with Compiz) would be useful. Flannel has a couple he can bring.
# Launchpad expiration discussion (from <nowiki>[[CaliforniaTeam-Meetings-07December02|last meeting]]</nowiki>) never made it to the mailing list; Flannel will get to that at some point.
# Two weeks from now is December 30th, which is in the middle of holidays, so the next meeting will be in January instead.

1. <nowiki>[[CaliforniaTeam-Projects-Scale6x|SCaLE6x]]</nowiki>
   a. Booth application submitted. We'll probably get accepted.
   a. Canonical will probably have a booth. Flannel will email them to get "swag".
   a. Postpone specific plans (number of people at booth, etc.) until we get accepted.
1. Launchpad Membership Timeouts
   a. Flannel set our Launchpad group to not expire members automatically. This was intended to be a temporary setting.
   a. Expiry is good because it gives us an idea of how many active/interested members we have. People would be emailed every so often asking if they want to stay in the group; if they don't reply, they get expired out of it.
   a. Discussion of how long between emails. No clear consensus, so the topic was moved to the mailing list.
1. Installfest postmortem
   a. Case badges were a hit. We distributed a CD! Not much actual installing went on, though.
   a. nhaines presented on FOSS, instead of his original GPG plan.
   a. Pictures didn't come out well because of weird lighting.
1. Release party
   a. The party at BarCamp LA was really cool! Next time, we should stay longer and do an Ubuntu presentation in the breakout room. 
   a. Some people thought we were from Canonical (because of Ubuntu t-shirts and nametags?). The nametags were really cool, though.
1. The-Kernel proposed that we package the Jabber server program "Openfire" 
   a. Consider asking the creators, Jive Software, to do it for us
   a. Updates as The-Kernel researches it will be posted on the mailing list

# Not many people were around, and DST had just happened, so this meeting was rather informal :-).
# Some photos from the Installfest made it to flickr
   a. Maybe we should make an ubuntu-california tag on flickr for our photos?

1. Gutsy Installfest
   a. Info page: <nowiki>[[CaliforniaTeam-Projects-GutsyRelease]]</nowiki>
   a. Yasumoto had problems getting a room for it, so we need to reconsider venue and time.
     i. Ideas: move venue to CSU Dominguez Hills' Sun Lab; push date back a week; co-ordinate with the new LUG at Cabrillo College?
   a. Maybe film the talks? Maybe come up with a schedule of talks?
   a. Probably not allowed food in installfest venue; go to a restaurant afterwards instead?
   a. Presentations: nhaines on GPG, lcafiero on FOSS
2. California LUG discussion
   a. lcafiero mentioned that Cabrillo College is forming a LUG
   a. Yasumoto and charlesnw mentioned OCLUG, but neither have had much of a chance to meet them
   a. UC Irvine has no LUG activity :-(
   a. SVLUG had a Gutsy installfest yesterday that went really well.
3. <nowiki>[[CaliforniaTeam-Projects-Logo|New Logo]]</nowiki> discussion
   a. Several people liked 6, but think that the drop shadow makes it too busy.
   a. Consensus that dropping the shadow from 6 would make it the best.
4. General discussion about filming and multimedia on Linux
