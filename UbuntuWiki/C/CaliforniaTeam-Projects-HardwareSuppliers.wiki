This page is implementing the <nowiki>[[UbuntuFriendlyHardwareSuppliers]]</nowiki> idea for California.  By contacting local (and  national) suppliers LoCo members can promote Ubuntu and inform the suppliers about existing <nowiki>[[http://webapps.ubuntu.com/partners/system/#na|programs]]</nowiki> to meet their customers' needs.  We hope California computer users will find these pages useful when making purchasing decisions.

For more general information see <nowiki>[[HardwareSupport]]</nowiki>.
