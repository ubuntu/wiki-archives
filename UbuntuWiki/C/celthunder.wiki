=== About Me ===
Hello all, I'm Sean Allen Zipperer.  I've used multiple distros of Linux and but I'm always trying new things.  I'm usually willing to help people as long as I am at home and have the time to help. 
=== Team Memberships ===
   None at the moment.

=== My Contributions to the Ubuntu Community ===
I'm always idling  {*} #ubuntu, {*} #ubuntu-beginners, and {*} #ubuntu-beginners-team on IRC.Freenode.net and I occasionally read the forums and try to help out there too.

==== Current Project & Goals ====
My current project is pretty much messing around on my servers learning as much as I can. Currently though I'm starting to document what does and does not work on what makes the systems I really liked vs disliked.

=== Future Plans & Projects ===
Once I finish college (hopefully soon) I will try to write a few how-to guides for people who are new.
