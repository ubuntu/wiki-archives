=== About Me ===

  I've been using Linux off and on since 2000, starting with Caldera 2.3.  I've been through Mandrake, Gentoo, and Redhat.  I first successfully installed Ubuntu with 7.10, and shortly after that I converted every machine I own to Ubuntu. I am currently working on building a working Linux From Scratch system (in a virtual machine). 

==== Socially ====

  Honestly, I have very little life outside work and family.  I am married, and have 2 kids, ages 7 and 11.  I do enjoy IRC and the occasional camping trip.

==== Professionally ====

In real life, I'm a technical support specialist with a regional ISP.  Which means I help the general public with internet-related computer issues over the phone. Although we don't 'officially' support Linux, we have several Ubuntu users in the department and generally do whatever we can to support Linux users under the table.

=== Ubuntu Participation ===

==== Ubuntu Forums ====

At the moment, I tend to post rather erratically on the forums, but try to help out in the Absolute Beginners board whenever I think I have something useful to contribute. I've been on the forums since 2008.

==== US Ohio LoCo ====

I am a member of the Ohio LoCo, and the default Toledo ReLoCo team lead.  I plan on starting up a local Ubuntu Hour within the next couple of months, once I figure out a good date and location.  I helped man the Ubuntu LoCo booth at Ohio Linux Fest in 2010.

==== Internet Relay Chat ====

My registered IRC nickname is canthus13.  I am looking forward to getting to know the Ubuntu community members better through this medium.  I am usually present in the following channels:

1. #ubuntu
2. #shellium 
3. #ubuntu-offtopic
4. #ubuntu-us-oh

=== Linux User Group (LUG) ===

I do not attend any LUG's currently,  though it is something I would like to get involved with.  I hope to find out more about any LUG's near to me and attend a meeting soon.

=== Goals For The Future ===

1.  Continue to post in support sections of the ubuntu forums 
2.  Continue to get Friends and Family trying Ubuntu
3.  Continue to offer assistance on IRC
4.  Successfully finish a Linux From Scratch installation
5.  Join a LUG
6.  Help the Toledo, OH ReLoCo grow.
7.  Eventual Ubuntu Membership.
