=== Who Is Chris Crane? ===
I'm a Project Manager who ''used to'' know a lot about the innards of unix than I currently do. 

Whilst my current role is largely irrelevant here, I do remember enough about my former roles (incl. Sys Admin on ''AT&T 3b2 600'' and ''SUN Sparc 1+'') to stress those key words (''used to'') in the opening sentence :-)

=== Ubuntu ===
I started using Ubuntu in March 2007 with a Final Edgy (6.10) install on a <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LaptopTestingTeam/DellInspiron1100|DELL Inspiron 1100]]</nowiki>.  I did have some issues with this as documented on that page, although they are now sorted.  Many thanks to Jeremy who ''still'' knows a lot more about the innards of unix than I currently do and quickly pointed me in the right direction (including towards Ubuntu in the first place).
