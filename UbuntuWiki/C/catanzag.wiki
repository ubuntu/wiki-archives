I started playing around computing in 1985 with the C=64, and it's a long story of passion since then...<<BR>>
I joined Ubuntu on June 2006 with Ubuntu 6.06 Dapper Drake.<<BR>>
Due to my job and my family, I've not so much time to dedicate to Ubuntu, but in my spare time I try to give some help in the forums and now I started with Rosetta.<<BR>>

In the italian <nowiki>[[http://wiki.ubuntu-it.org/GruppoTraduzione/RosettaToDo|RosettaToDo]]</nowiki>, I've read that there was a big job to do with
<nowiki>[[https://translations.launchpad.net/ubuntu/gutsy/+source/libexif/+pots/libexif-12/it/+translate|libexif]]</nowiki>, and, as  I like photos and have a bit experience on it, I'm giving my contribution there.
