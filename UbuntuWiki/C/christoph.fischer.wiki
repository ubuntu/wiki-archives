=== About Me ===

Mostly, I know Linux from server administration. On the desktop, I have been using various Linux flavors over the years just to try them out. Until recently, my main desktop was running on Windows XP, due to a number of Windows lock-ins. One by one, I have managed to eliminate them and was ready to take the plunge with Oneiric. Haven't looked back since :-).

==== Socially ====

Outside of computers I like being around my family (Rebecca & my two girls), cooking (which I find very relaxing, so I get to do it every day) and reading (anything I can get my hands on.

==== Professionally ====

I am working as a pastor in a Pentecostal/Evangelical church in Southwestern Germany. I have always been interested in software and programming, which occupies a lot of my free time. As someone with decision power in my church organization, I am pushing for the adoption of FOSS software everywhere, even if that means we have to make adaptations by contributing features, etc.

I am maintaining a couple of different server installs for my church organization (web services and intranets). All of them are running on Debian-based distributions, with the latest ones using Ubuntu Server.
