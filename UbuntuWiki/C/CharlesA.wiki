=== My Background ===

My first experience with Linux was with RedHat 6.2, but I don't really remember all that much about it except that I was very confused when trying to use it and got frustrated easily.

In 2007, I took a Linux class in college and got a bit more familiar with the terminal and the different commands that existed. I primarily used Pink Tie Linux, which is/was based off of RedHat.

Around that time I decided to install a server-class OS on the machine I was using as a file server, since I wanted to go in another direction and Windows XP wouldn't work for what I wanted to do. I was trying to decide between either Windows Server or some version of Linux at the time, and after comparing the pros and cons of each, I decided to give Linux a shot, Ubuntu in particular. I suppose what got me hooked was that it was free to download and use and I really didn't need a full blown "Windows Server" deal, and Windows Home Server had a lot of things that were "unsupported," such as logging in to the console and using RAID.

Anyway, I decided to check out Ubuntu and started off with 9.04 and kinda went from there. I'm now running Ubuntu Lucid Lynx x64 on that same machine, which runs headless now, and gets administered via SSH for the most part.

=== Participation ===

I have been a member of the UbuntuForums since October of 2009, and a member of Staff since September of 2010.

I mostly stick to the Security and Server Platforms areas as well as Virtualization and General Help, but I try to help out when I can.
