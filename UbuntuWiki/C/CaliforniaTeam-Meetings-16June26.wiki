# Announcements
# Update team logo with 2010 branding. In 2010 the Ubuntu logo switched from the tri-color logo to the simple orange circle of friends in a <nowiki>[[http://www.jonobacon.org/2010/03/03/refreshing-the-ubuntu-brand/|branding refresh]]</nowiki> where the new Ubuntu font was also introduced. Then in April of this year, the design team <nowiki>[[http://design.canonical.com/2016/04/ubuntu-orange-update/|announced]]</nowiki> a change in official Ubuntu color to #E95420 (all color palette details <nowiki>[[http://design.ubuntu.com/brand/colour-palette|here]]</nowiki>). However, the <nowiki>[[http://ubuntu-california.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/california_loco-300x285.png|Ubuntu California logo]]</nowiki> has remained the same pre-2010 colors and style. Should we put out a call to contributors to see if someone wishes to update our logo?
   a. It's becoming increasingly awkward for me to use the old branding at events, I note this as I'm leading up to our SF release party and getting ready to prepare and print materials. I'd really like to see the branding updated to be the same logo as before (I love the bear!) but with the new circle of friends in the new orange. I support putting out a call to contributors to update it. (pleia2)
   a. Yes I agree this would be nice with the bear and new colors (lynorian)
   a. I disagree.  Canonical have not clarified the recent branding changes and we should wait until they figure out whatever it is they're trying to do with the colors to avoid duplication of work. (nhaines)
