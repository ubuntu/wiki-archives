(captured by Bob Jonkman)

<pre>
(2010-12-12 18:58:54) dscassel: Anyone here for the meeting?
(2010-12-12 19:00:55) dscassel: I am tempted to just postpone.
(2010-12-12 19:01:17) Yompa: I was here to listen in, not planning to participate :-)
(2010-12-12 19:01:31) dscassel: Hey, Yompa.
(2010-12-12 19:01:42) Yompa: Good evening!
(2010-12-12 19:03:43) dscassel: Whereabouts are you anyway? (I've probably already asked that, but I'm terrible at remembering IRC nicks)
(2010-12-12 19:05:52) Yompa: No I never introduced myself really. I'm in Montreal but I'm of Swedish origin and I still have trouble with the French language so I prefer the English channels for now.
(2010-12-12 19:07:32) dscassel: That's cool. We have a bunch of Quebec people here.
(2010-12-12 19:07:55) BobJonkman: <in>Bob here, live in Elmira ON, but typing from somewhere in Toronto <out>
(2010-12-12 19:08:44) dscassel: Yompa: Have you been out to any of the ubuntu-qc Ubuntu Hours or anything?
(2010-12-12 19:09:08) dscassel: BobJonkman: This is probably going to be a pretty informal 'meeting.'
(2010-12-12 19:09:25) dscassel: My main action item's going to be hunt down txwikinger and find out why the site's down.
(2010-12-12 19:10:09) Yompa: I'm a C and C++ programmer by profession and I got caught by Ubuntu the other year, loving it and using it daily now. I'm more or less just idling here to see what's going on locally.
(2010-12-12 19:10:42) Yompa: Haven't been to a Ubuntu Hour yet, I know there are some in Montreal right?
(2010-12-12 19:11:41) dscassel: Yeah, ubuntu-qc has one every Thursday in Montreal and Longueuil.
(2010-12-12 19:12:35) dscassel: -qc mainly operates in French, but the Montreal group seems to be pretty multilingual.
(2010-12-12 19:12:50) dscassel: Talk to MagicFab about it if you see him around.
(2010-12-12 19:14:40) Yompa: Alright thanks, will visit one. Montrealers are usually pretty good with languages.
(2010-12-12 19:15:40) dscassel: They may have moved it to Fridays.  The last one was here: http://loco.ubuntu.com/events/team/592/detail/
(2010-12-12 19:21:18) Yompa: I see the last one was close to Parc Avenue, not far from where I live. I will keep an eye on the next Hour event.
(2010-12-12 19:22:04) dscassel: Awesome. :)
(2010-12-12 19:22:18) dscassel: MagicFab is the one who came up with the Ubuntu Hour idea.
(2010-12-12 19:22:44) dscassel: I want to go check out his Hour if I happen to be in Montreal sometime when it's on.
(2010-12-12 19:23:10) Yompa: I see, so it's a Canadian thing only still? Or the idea is spreading?
(2010-12-12 19:23:33) dscassel: Definitely spreading. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Hour
(2010-12-12 19:23:42) dscassel: A few in the Europe. Lots in the US.
