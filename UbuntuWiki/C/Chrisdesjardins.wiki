Ubuntu/Xubuntu Rules!

I run a Dell Inspiron 1100 with Breezy Badger 5.10.  
Installing Ubuntu or Debian on an Inspiron 1100 is very easy.
-The only problem is that you need to get a 845patch from here 
http://www.chzsoft.com.ar/855patch.html
to get 1024 x 768 resolution and not just 800 x 600
Everything else works like a charm.  
-I run an Orinoco Gold PC Wireless Card.  This works out of the box.  
-I have a Dell A920 all-in-one printer.  To install it on Ubuntu follow the directions on this link.

If that doesn't work do a google search of "z600 and ubuntu"

Look me up on irc.freenode.net #ubuntu or #xubuntu
I'm ecobuntu
