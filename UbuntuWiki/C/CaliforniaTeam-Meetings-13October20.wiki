[02:01] <pleia2> for the first time in a little while we don't have any agenda items
[02:01] <jyo> o/
[02:01] <pleia2> we had a fun little release party in SF this week, jyo was there :D

[02:02] <darthrobot`> Title: [A Little San Francisco 13.10 Release Party â€“ pleia2's blog]
[02:02] <jyo> Yes, thanks again for organizing it, pleia2. :D
[02:02] <pleia2> overlapped with lots of other events that day, and the openstack release, so attendance was a bit sparse, but it was still fun and we'll do better for 14.04
[02:02] <pleia2> sure!
[02:02] <grantbow> lts is much bigger deal
[02:03] <pleia2> yeah
[02:03] <grantbow> though touch was big this cycle
[02:03] <pleia2> I tried to get MJ to loan me his galaxy nexus to flash, but he won't :)
[02:04] <grantbow> i won't either on my galaxy nexus until I have a better android phone
[02:04] <grantbow> nexus7 testing works ok
[02:04] <pleia2> all the options are a bit too expensive for me right now (even n7), but I might be able to check it out once prices come down
[02:05]  * pleia2 just uses grantbow's n7
[02:05] <jyo> I think everyone missed that $200 N4 clearance sale.
[02:05] <grantbow> happy to provide i
[02:05] <grantbow> it
[02:05] <pleia2> jyo: yeah :(
[02:05] <grantbow> really?
[02:05] <grantbow> when is the n5 scheduled?
[02:06] <pleia2> not sure
[02:06] <pleia2> it was leaked a couple days ago, but was gone again last I looked
[02:07] <jyo> grantbow: Yeah, price dropped to $200 in late late August and poof, gone by mid September.
[02:07] <grantbow> http://twit.tv/aaa might have the scoop
[02:07] <darthrobot`> Title: [All About Android | TWiT.TV]
[02:08] <pleia2> :)
[02:09] <pleia2> lots of news this week about the phone release, the ubuntu weekly newsletter this week is packed
[02:09] <pleia2> anyone have any upcoming events or anything to share?
[02:09] <pleia2> congrats to the olpcsf folks for getting olpcsf day again this year https://twitter.com/olpcsf/status/391561326390046720/photo/1
[02:09] <darthrobot`> Title: [Twitter / olpcsf: Good morning! Today is One ...]
[02:10] <grantbow> nothing out of the ordinary weekly/monthly stuff
[02:10] <grantbow> except that, thanks pleia2
[02:10] <pleia2> oh, we were re-verified this week (formerlly "re-approval" process)

[02:11] <grantbow> yes, good work
[02:11] <jyo> legacy naming scheme ftw?
[02:11] <pleia2> hah
[02:11] <pleia2> too late to change :)
[02:12] <pleia2> I'm inclined to wrap this up unless there is anything else
[02:12] <pleia2> congrats to everyone who worked on the release :)
[02:12] <pleia2> eps: anything from you before we finish up?
[02:13] <eps> I have no idea what I missed
[02:13] <grantbow> with logs, you will :-)
[02:13] <eps> Supet inconvenient right now
[02:16] <pleia2> it was a pretty quiet meeting, yay release, yay phablets
[02:16] <pleia2> we can wrap up :)
