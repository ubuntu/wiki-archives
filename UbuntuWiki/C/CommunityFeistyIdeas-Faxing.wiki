==== Issues Relating To Faxing ====

Fax support is useful in small and home office and integrated with a computer can save on waste paper and so help the environment.  What can we do to make faxing work better?

* Have a default outgoing fax printer out of the box (like Windows).
* Allow easy configuration of fax-to-email, so incoming faxes end up in Evolution / Thunderbird.
