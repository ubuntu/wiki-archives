=== Corey J. Steele ===
My name is Corey J. Steele.  I'm a long-time FLOSS user and supporter.  I first began using Linux back in 1995 in the 1.2 kernel days.  I've used Slackware, Red Hat, Debian, and of course Ubuntu.  My professional area of specialty is information security, but I do a fair bit of coding and sysadmin bits too.

You can e-mail me at coreyjsteele<at>yahoo<dot>com or visit my homepage at http://intertrusion.com.
