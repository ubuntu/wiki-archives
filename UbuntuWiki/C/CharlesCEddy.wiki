I am an 18 year old college student, going into my sophomore year.  I am a French and History double major, who uses Ubuntu as a personal operating system.  By profession, I work at my school's information technology department, where I actively promote Linux, working in a Windows only environment.  I have helped to translate Ubuntu programs on launchpad, and I have also been as active in the forums as possible, using what knowledge I have of this OS to help people adjust to it and enjoy their time in the best computing environment out there.
