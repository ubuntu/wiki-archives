__TOC__

Chris Lockfort would like to have the time to help develop Ubuntu more, but doesn't. Chris is a computer engineering (EECC) student at the Rochester Institute of Technology. Chris is mostly on here just to post and talk about bugs, and occasionally has free time enough to patch some fixes in with help from other developers.
Chris Lockfort (or, CLockfort as many call him) has his blog up at http://clockfort.com , and publishes new coding project ideas and project status of already-started projects there.
