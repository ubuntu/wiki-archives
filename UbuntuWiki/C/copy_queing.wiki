==== Summary ====
The ability to que set number of files being copied simultaneously, when a new file is selected to be copied at the same time a current file is being copied it will be qued rather then having another copy dialog window popping up

Also have the ability to cancel a file that is being qued to copy
==== Rationale ====
Currenty when a user needs to copy multiple documents he is often bombared with a number of copying windows each trying to compete for system resources.
==== Use cases ====
This would allow users to change file copy priority and cancel files that have not yet begun to be copied, it would work similar to FireFox's downloader.

Common use is during system administrative task where large volumes of data needs to be moved with ease but were a limited strain is presented on the overall system

Another key feature is that the user is not bombarded with a multitude of different file copyign windows.

==== Scope ====

==== Design ====

==== Implementation ====
I believe Nautilus is currently in charge of the graphical file copying a change as this would require rewriting some of its code and increasing its code base.
==== Code ====

==== Data preservation and migration ====

==== Outstanding issues ====
Need support and programmers, ideal developer would be someone already withing the Gnome development team.
==== BoF agenda and discussion ====
* I believe that this could be implemented using the new gvfs which is coming in Ubuntu Hardy.
