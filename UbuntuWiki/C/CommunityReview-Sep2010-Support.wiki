== September 2010 Community Report : Support ==

<nowiki>[[CommunityReview-Sep2010|<-- Back to the main Community Report page]]</nowiki>

This report is being put together by: '''TBC'''

This report is here to satisfy the following use case:

<pre>
Sam is a bit of a power user and enjoys helping people with technical questions. How and where can he/she provide this help?
</pre>

The goal of this assessment to identify what typical experience Sam may have and areas in which it can be approved.

=== Assessment Process ===

To perform this assessment we would like to ask those involved to perform the following steps:

1. First put yourself in the position of Sam who has no idea how to participate within this area. How does find out about to participate, where our resources are, which communication channels they can use etc? Please enter your findings into the ''Discoverability'' section below.
2. How does Sam learn the skills to participate in this area? Enter your findings in the ''Learnability' section below.
3. How does Sam know what to work on and how to contribute? Enter your findings in the ''Doability'' section below.
4. Find five community members who are very new to the community and ask them to answer the questions in the ''New Community Member Feedback'' section below.
5. Finally, review all the findings you have notes down here and propose a set of improvements that are concrete things we can work on. Note these in the ''Recommendations For Improvement'' section below.

=== Findings ===

''To ensure our work is as useful as possible, please ensure that all findings are factual and not based on opinion and perception, and where possible, backed up with links to resources that outline the findings''.

==== Discoverability ====

Items to consider:

* How do new community members typically start learning about the community?
* What is the primary web pages and points of contact when new community members get involved?
* Are there magazines, other websites and other resources that often act as on-ramps for community members to get involved?

==== Learnability ====

Items to consider:

* What documentation/resources are available?
* What support channels are available to help them learn?

Critically - from the perspective of someone completely new to learning the skills in this area of the community, are our resources easy to follow and understand?

==== Doability ====

Items to consider:

* How does someone know what to work on?
* How do they contribute their work back?
* How easy is it for Sam to understand how this works?

==== New Community Member Feedback ====

''Within this part of the community, look at which community members are new (such as new MOTUs in the Packager assessment or those newly participating in LoCo teams in the Advocacy assessment) and pick five community members to answer the following questions on this page. They should include their answers below''.
