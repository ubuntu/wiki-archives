===== Adding Photo Right/Left Rotate from right click contextual menu =====

This is not the only way to add this functionality to Nautilus, however,
this is a dead simple way to do it.

We will be adding a Rotate Right and Rotate Left functionality to the
right click contextual menu in nautilus. You may select multiple JPEGs in
a folder within nautilus and apply a right or left rotation to a selection
of photos.

First, you will need 2 dependencies, '''jpegtran''', and '''jhead'''. These will
be used by bash scripts made available to nautilus.

1) try '''which jpegtran''' and '''which jhead'''. If these are missing you need
to apt-get them or install them with your package manager.

2) '''cd ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts'''

3) using your favourite text editor create two files named '''rotate_right'''
and '''rotate_left'''. These will be bash scripts acting as wrappers to the
two utilities.

4) copy and paste the following script into '''rotate_right'''
<pre>
while <nowiki>[[ -n "$1" ]]</nowiki>; do
    if <nowiki>[[ -f "$1" ]]</nowiki>; then
        jpegtran -rotate 90 -copy all \
            -outfile "$1" "$1"
        
##### clear rotation/orientation tag
        jhead -norot "$1"
    fi
    shift
done
</pre>

5) copy and paste this script into '''rotate_left'''
<pre>
while <nowiki>[[ -n "$1" ]]</nowiki>; do
### if a file and not a dir
    if <nowiki>[[ -f "$1" ]]</nowiki>; then
        jpegtran -rotate 270 -copy all \
            -outfile "$1" "$1"
        
##### clear rotation/orientation tag
        jhead -norot "$1"
    fi
    shift
done
</pre>

6) Make your scripts executable.
<pre>
chmod +x ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts/rotate_right
chmod +x ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts/rotate_left
</pre>

6) Logout and back in to your system to reinitialize nautilus.

7) Now when you right click on one or more JPEG photos you will have a
scripts menu option with 'rotate_right' and 'rotate_left'

8) Although this menu is available when scripts exist in
'''~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts/''' the actions will only work on JPEG images

9) Notes: According to the documentation on 'jpegtran' the rotations are
lossless transformations, however I observed the file size increase
slightly (a few dozen bytes) after rotating images. The image quality
did not appear to be affected, but also no photo manipulation software
recommends rotating images repeatedly as it could result in a loss in
quality.
