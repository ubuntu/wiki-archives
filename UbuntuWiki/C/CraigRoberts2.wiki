=== About ===
I'm a student in England, the United Kingdom. Ubuntu is my main Operating System on my Dell Inspiron 1501, which is my pride and joy. Ubuntu was simply the easiest distribution to install, with the best hardware support while remaining technical enough to allow me to learn the ins and outs of Linux. As such, if a better distro comes along, I'll switch without hesitation.
