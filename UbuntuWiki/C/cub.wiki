=== About Me ===

My name is Jimmy Sjölund but I usually go by 'cub' online since, well forever. I started out as a sound technician, amateur musician, computer geek who ended up in the IT world. I have always fiddled with computers since my first <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments_TI-99/4A|Texas Instruments TI-99/4A]]</nowiki>. I explored different distributions until I landed with Ubuntu in 2004. I switched to Ubuntu Studio in 2007, but being an analog studio technician/musician I didn't start using Ubuntu Studio for audio recordings until 2010.
I have been an active member of the Ubuntu Forums since 2006 and recently felt confident I could do more for the community and contacted the Ubuntu Studio team.
I like to try out new things but when it comes to day-to-day work I want my environment to be stable, low on resources, and if possible somewhat shiny.

=== Contributions ===
So far my contributions have been to help out in the <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/|Ubuntu Forums]]</nowiki> as much as possible, mostly in the Ubuntu Studio and Absolute Beginner Section. Lately I have been helping out with support in the #ubuntustudio channel as well as on <nowiki>[[http://askubuntu.com/|AskUbuntu]]</nowiki>.
I have also engaged in discussions on the Ubuntu Studio mailing lists as well as the #ubuntustudio-devel channel where I can and have any expertise or ideas to share.

=== Future Goals ===
My goals are to become more active in the development of Ubuntu Studio, broaden the areas where I can provide support, learn about packaging and participate in testing of the new releases.
