__TOC__

Cindy has been handling end-user computer training since 1984. Cindy used to be connected with the International Center for Computer Studies (where she was part of the team who worked on the Catholic Mass Media Awardee, "The Computer Program" over at Channel 4). In 1994, she and 2 friends established Tri-Global Computer Systems, Inc./Tri-Global Computer Training Center in Makati.

Having been in the computer training industry for more than 2 decades now, Cindy hopes to make Tri-Global Computer Training Center one of the first if not the first FOSS End-User training center in the Philippines by offering courses for Ubuntu/Kubuntu/Edubuntu Linux and the various application software to complement the distro.
