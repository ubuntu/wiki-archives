Email: 
I'm Colin, a 23 yo guy from the Netherlands.

This summer I seriously started using Linux. Gentoo at first, but after a few installs (I prefer learning by trial and error), I got tired of compiling an entire desktop, so I sought something else. That's when I came across Ubuntu, which I stuck with ever since.

And yes, I do still have a working Windows installation beside Ubuntu. I hardly ever use it anymore, but sometimes it's just easier to do something in Windows rather than Linux.

So that's my short Linux history.
