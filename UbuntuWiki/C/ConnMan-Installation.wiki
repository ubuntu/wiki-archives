<nowiki>[[ConnMan|Back to main page]]</nowiki>

=== Ubuntu 10.04 LTS (Lucid Lynx) ===

Installation instructions for Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, applies both to Desktop and UNE:

1. Install Indicator Network PPA:

    <pre>
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:indicator-network-developers/ppa
sudo apt-get update
    </pre>

1. Install indicator-network (which will also install connman):

    <pre>
sudo apt-get install indicator-network
    </pre>

1. Disable !NetworkManager from starting during boot:

    <pre>
sudo mv /etc/init/network-manager.conf /etc/init/network-manager.conf-disabled
sudo mv /etc/xdg/autostart/nm-applet.desktop /etc/xdg/autostart/nm-applet.desktop.disabled
    </pre>

1. Reboot computer.

1. Use <nowiki>[[NetworkSettings|NetworkMenu]]</nowiki> by clicking network indicator icon.

Please note that network-manager is still installed, but not running. Also the nm-applet is removed from the panel.

=== Ubuntu 10.10 (Maverick Meerkat) ===

indicator-network and connman are now included in Maverick Meerkat, so there is no need to install any PPAs.

1. Install indicator-network (which will also install connman):

    <pre>
sudo apt-get install indicator-network
    </pre>

1. Disable !NetworkManager from starting during boot:

    <pre>
sudo mv /etc/init/network-manager.conf /etc/init/network-manager.conf-disabled
sudo mv /etc/xdg/autostart/nm-applet.desktop /etc/xdg/autostart/nm-applet.desktop.disabled
    </pre>

1. Reboot computer.

1. Use <nowiki>[[NetworkSettings|NetworkMenu]]</nowiki> by clicking network indicator icon.

=== Ubuntu 11.04 (Natty Narwhal) ===

1. Install indicator-network (which will also install connman):

    <pre>
sudo apt-get install indicator-network
    </pre>

1. Relogin to see the new network menu.

This installs both indicator-network and connman. As connman conflicts with network-manager, network-manager is automatically uninstalled.

=== Removing network-manager ===

If you are using lucid or maveric, want to continue using ConnMan and remove network-manager:

1. Remove network-manager
     <pre>
sudo apt-get remove network-manager-gnome network-manager
     </pre>

2. Also remove the files the we renamed above so that we don't leave them lingering for ever:
    <pre>
sudo rm /etc/init/network-manager.conf-disabled /etc/xdg/autostart/nm-applet.desktop.disabled
    </pre>

With natty network-manager is automatically removed and there's no need to remove it manually.

=== Reverting back to network-manager ===

To revert back to network-manager and remove all connman related packages with lucid and maverick:

1. In case you renamed the autostart files, rename them back to enable network-manager-gnome to start automatically:

  <pre>
sudo mv /etc/init/network-manager.conf-disabled /etc/init/network-manager.conf
sudo mv /etc/xdg/autostart/nm-applet.desktop.disabled /etc/xdg/autostart/nm-applet.desktop
  </pre>

1. Remove all connman related packages:

  <pre>
sudo apt-get remove indicator-network connman
  </pre>

1. Reboot computer.

With natty:

1. Install network-manager

  <pre>
sudo apt-get install network-manager-gnome
  </pre>

1. Remove all connman related packages (they should be removed already, this is just a precaution):

  <pre>
sudo apt-get remove indicator-network connman ofono
  </pre>

1. Reboot computer.
