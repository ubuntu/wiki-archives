https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CanadianTeam/Meetings/2011-08-09 

(2011-08-09 19:02:55) dscassel: Please feel free to introduce yourself.
Where are you? What do you do with/for/on Ubuntu? 

(2011-08-09 19:03:15) ***BobJonkman is Bob Jonkman, out of Elmira, just
north of Waterloo, N 

(2011-08-09 19:03:15) dscassel: I'm Darcy in Waterloo, and I'm the LoCo
Contact for Ubuntu Canada. 

(2011-08-09 19:03:33) dscassel: (feel free to ask what that means. :) 

(2011-08-09 19:03:46) BobJonkman: What does that mean? 

(2011-08-09 19:03:55) bregma: wow, it's that time already? I haven't
left work yet! 

(2011-08-09 19:04:00) razorgoto: I am Sammy Lao in Toronto. I am a
volunteer at Free Geek Toronto. 

(2011-08-09 19:04:08) zeroedout: I'm Alishams in Vancouver. Director at
Free Geek Vancouver, linux geek and Ubuntu lover 

(2011-08-09 19:04:29) dscassel: Cool. A meeting of the Free Geeks. :D 

(2011-08-09 19:04:32) ***psema4mobile is from Hamilton, uses ubuntu for
general home computing 

(2011-08-09 19:04:41) oracology: zeroedout: hey, i see you on the

(2011-08-09 19:04:47) Jeruvy: I am Jeruvy, a power user from Calgary.
Actually around for a meeting for a change :) 

(2011-08-09 19:04:59) zeroedout: oracology: yea, it's an awesome project

(2011-08-09 19:05:28) dscassel: BobJonkman: Well, you should probably
know already, but the LoCo contact acts as a point of contact between
the Canadian Ubuntu community (ie., us) and the LoCo council (and, in
turn, the community council). 

(2011-08-09 19:05:41) oracology: zeroedout: agreed. but it is my
bedtime, so I should head off to bed...talk to you again soon! 

(2011-08-09 19:06:00) zeroedout: bye! 

(2011-08-09 19:06:12) dscassel: Good night, oracology :) 

(2011-08-09 19:06:30) oracology: good night everyone! 

(2011-08-09 19:06:31) dscassel: Isn't it 4pm in Vancouver right now? 

(2011-08-09 19:06:40) razorgoto: good night zeroedout 

(2011-08-09 19:06:42) oracology: dscassel: i live in the UK, but i'm
from vancouver originally. 

(2011-08-09 19:06:50) dscassel: I was actually thinking about moving the
meeting out an hour... 

(2011-08-09 19:07:01) zeroedout: oh I'm still around 

(2011-08-09 19:07:06) dscassel: oracology: Ah, that's cool. :) 

(2011-08-09 19:07:13) oracology: razorgoto: i'm the one who's leaving
;). good night! 

(2011-08-09 19:07:23) oracology left the room (quit: Quit: Leaving.). 

(2011-08-09 19:08:03) razorgoto: oh. oops. my eyes skipped a line. 

(2011-08-09 19:08:06) dscassel: I'm going to get some water and settle
in for a minute. 

(2011-08-09 19:08:12) dscassel: Is there anything anybody wanted to add
to the agenda? 

(2011-08-09 19:08:50) dscassel: Hi psema4mobile. BobJonkman was telling
me about you. :) 

(2011-08-09 19:09:37) BobJonkman: I have a little stack of Ubuntu CDs
here, literally with your name on them. 

(2011-08-09 19:09:55) BobJonkman: (Well, with your name on the stack,
not the individual disks) 

(2011-08-09 19:09:59) psema4mobile: Lol. :-) 

(2011-08-09 19:10:48) psema4mobile: Sorry bit hard to type on this
phone. 

(2011-08-09 19:11:22) razorgoto: psema4mobile: You on a Desire Z? 

(2011-08-09 19:11:26) BobJonkman: psema4mobile and I are trying to set
up a date for an Ubuntu Hour in Hamilton 

(2011-08-09 19:11:56) psema4mobile: razorgoto no, xperia play 

(2011-08-09 19:12:10) BobJonkman: Maybe in September, if our calendars
remain clear 

(2011-08-09 19:12:37) psema4mobile: agree, need to clear off my plate a
bit. 

(2011-08-09 19:12:44) BobJonkman: psema4mobile becomes the latest member
of the Ubuntu Hour CD Bribery Program 

(2011-08-09 19:12:55) dscassel: Awesome. :D 

(2011-08-09 19:13:12) psema4mobile: B-) 

(2011-08-09 19:13:13) razorgoto: Great! :-) 

(2011-08-09 19:13:15) dscassel: I guess that means we should move onto
the only actual agenda item: 

(2011-08-09 19:13:17) dscassel: Events! 

(2011-08-09 19:14:10) dscassel: There's ubuntu hours, of course. 

(2011-08-09 19:14:22) dscassel: I'm running mine next Wednesday in
Waterloo. 

(2011-08-09 19:14:48) dscassel: Charles McColm is running one in
downtown Kitchener as well. 

(2011-08-09 19:14:52) BobJonkman: @chaslinux is running one in Kitchener

(2011-08-09 19:14:54) BobJonkman: :)) 

(2011-08-09 19:15:07) dscassel: So Ubuntu Canada currently has two
ubuntu hours: both in K-W. ^^; 

(2011-08-09 19:15:35) razorgoto: We are still trying for a consistent
one in Toronto. 

(2011-08-09 19:16:00) dscassel: If I could afford the time off, I'd do a
cross-country tour to do thim all over the place and show people they're
really not hard or anything. 

(2011-08-09 19:16:21) razorgoto: Linuxcaffe on College is kind of like a
semi-permanent Ubuntu Hour. ;-) 

(2011-08-09 19:16:30) dscassel: razorgoto: True. :) 

(2011-08-09 19:16:32) razorgoto: but agreed, dscassel. 

(2011-08-09 19:16:57) psema4mobile: If no one objects, can I get a
rundown? I've checked the eiki page but would prefer a first hand
description. 

(2011-08-09 19:17:09) dscassel: Of an Hour? 

(2011-08-09 19:17:23) dscassel: It's just a meet-up. 

(2011-08-09 19:17:39) dscassel: Laptops optional (depending on the
group, they are sometimes frowned upon). 

(2011-08-09 19:17:51) dscassel: Just meet local Ubuntu people. 

(2011-08-09 19:18:05) dscassel: You can talk about Ubuntu, or whatever
else comes up. 

(2011-08-09 19:18:14) psema4mobile: an informal outreach, user get
together then. ok 

(2011-08-09 19:18:24) dscassel: Yeah, basically. 

(2011-08-09 19:18:27) psema4mobile: cool. 

(2011-08-09 19:18:41) dscassel: It gives people a reliable *thing* they
can start building a community around. 

(2011-08-09 19:18:50) BobJonkman: dscassel: There are Ubuntu Hours on
the calendar for Longeuil and Montreal too 

(2011-08-09 19:19:11) dscassel: BobJonkman: Yes, true, but I won't take
credit for ubuntu-qc. :) 

(2011-08-09 19:19:44) dscassel: I'm going to try to get to one when I'm
in Montreal in a couple weeks. 

(2011-08-09 19:20:27) dscassel: (I'll be close to the Outremont one, but
I'm taking the train to Ottawa on Thursday...) 

(2011-08-09 19:20:56) dscassel: Also, the Ubuntu global Jam is coming
up. Sept 2-4. 

(2011-08-09 19:21:08) dscassel: We'll be hosting a Jam event at
Kwartzlab. 

(2011-08-09 19:21:50) dscassel: (Ubuntu Jams, btw, are all about
* contributing* to Ubuntu. Testing, bug triage, development, etc.) 

(2011-08-09 19:22:36) dscassel: txwikinger has a plan to build an
automated packaging tool to help with package updates especially. 

(2011-08-09 19:22:59) dscassel: So we'll be doing something like a
hackathon around that, i think. 

(2011-08-09 19:23:02) BobJonkman: I've reported bugs, but haven't
actually contributed code. 

(2011-08-09 19:23:10) dscassel: Or whatever else the people who show up
want to do. 

(2011-08-09 19:23:47) dscassel: BobJonkman: Nothing wrong with that. :) 

(2011-08-09 19:24:29) BobJonkman: And Ubuntu Community Boosterism is a
contribution too 

(2011-08-09 19:24:48) dscassel: BobJonkman: Absolutely. :) 

(2011-08-09 19:25:55) bregma: Ubuntu likes non-coding contributions 

(2011-08-09 19:26:13) BobJonkman: The Ubuntu Jams happen close to the
next version release date 

(2011-08-09 19:26:32) bregma: end of October? 

(2011-08-09 19:26:45) dscassel: After beta 1. 

(2011-08-09 19:26:52) BobJonkman: I think Oneiric releases on Oct 13 

(2011-08-09 19:27:10) bregma:
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/OneiricReleaseSchedule 

(2011-08-09 19:27:59) dscassel: Stuff's pretty locked down by the time
the Jam comes around. 

(2011-08-09 19:28:21) dscassel: Which is why the emphasis tends to be on
testing and triage. 

(2011-08-09 19:28:38) bregma: actually the lock down starts Thursday 

(2011-08-09 19:28:41) dscassel: txwikinger was getting kind of bored
with triage, tho (He's kind of done a lot of it. :) 

(2011-08-09 19:28:57) bregma: some of us start work on the P-series next
week 

(2011-08-09 19:29:05) bregma: I wish it had a name 

(2011-08-09 19:29:16) BobJonkman: Still, we need someone to show the
rest of us how triage is done. 

(2011-08-09 19:29:34) BobJonkman: It's much more comfortable with an
experienced triager at the helm 

(2011-08-09 19:29:50) dscassel: BobJonkman: Yeah, and I don't think
he'll mind helping out. 

(2011-08-09 19:30:47) dscassel: bregma: What do you *do*, exactly. :) 

(2011-08-09 19:31:07) dscassel: I ask out of genuine interest. 

(2011-08-09 19:33:08) razorgoto: guys, for the jam, do you guys do it
all in one physical location? 

(2011-08-09 19:33:55) dscassel: razorgoto: Depends on the Jam. 

(2011-08-09 19:34:06) dscassel: For ours, yeah. we hold it here at
Kwartzlab. 

(2011-08-09 19:34:11) BobJonkman: In Kitchener Waterloo we go to
Kwartzlab. The camraderie is nice, even if we don't get much work done 

(2011-08-09 19:34:20) dscassel: I know there are other Jams that are
distributed, and people work together on things over IRC. 

(2011-08-09 19:35:36) ***psema4mobile wishes there were a GO route
brtween Hamilton and KW 

(2011-08-09 19:35:53) dscassel: razorgoto: I know you guys were
interested in running Jams at Free Geek, but I guess you're busy with
Linux Fest...? 

(2011-08-09 19:35:56) razorgoto: I've polled around here at Free Geek,
we have the space, but we don't have someone interested in organizing
one. 

(2011-08-09 19:36:02) dscassel: psema4mobile: You're not the only one.
:) 

(2011-08-09 19:36:11) BobJonkman: psema4mobile Are you involved with the
Hamilton Hackerspace? 

(2011-08-09 19:36:25) psema4mobile: um, loosely. 

(2011-08-09 19:37:11) psema4mobile: Ive spoken with a few if the
communities members 

(2011-08-09 19:37:26) dscassel: I just know Adina... 

(2011-08-09 19:37:33) dscassel: (even then not very well) 

(2011-08-09 19:38:29) dscassel: Speaking of hackerspaces, SoOnCon 2011
is October 1 at Bell Lightbox in Toronto. 

(2011-08-09 19:38:38) cvillaco: dscassel, do I understand that one of
the jam locations may be running irc? 

(2011-08-09 19:39:10) cvillaco: sorry for my typing, my hand is in a
brace right now and want to catch before the question is gone 

(2011-08-09 19:39:21) dscassel: cvillaco: I know they've had virtual
jams in the past, but I haven't heard about one this time. 

(2011-08-09 19:39:28) dscassel: I can look into it for you. 

(2011-08-09 19:39:40) dscassel: I'm sure BobJonkman and I will be online
here during the proceedings. :) 

(2011-08-09 19:39:45) kjwcode: Any Vancouver, BC events? 

(2011-08-09 19:39:50) dscassel: We can set up the webcam too.. 

(2011-08-09 19:39:51) ***psema4mobile will be right back after these
msgs 

(2011-08-09 19:39:57) BobJonkman: I'll be at Kwartzlab, and I can bring
a dedicated laptop for IRC 

(2011-08-09 19:40:24) dscassel: kjwcode: You'd have to check Ubuntu
Vancouver. http://www.meetup.com/ubuntuvancouver/ 

(2011-08-09 19:40:37) cvillaco: i wonder if there would be enough
attendees via irc to mak eit worthwhile, it could be a porta if there is
interest for the members who are not close to a session 

(2011-08-09 19:40:39) dscassel: Randall Ross has posted cryptic blog
posts about it. 

(2011-08-09 19:40:40) kjwcode: dscassel: Thanks for the pointer --
checking! 

(2011-08-09 19:41:06) dscassel: kjwcode: np :) 

(2011-08-09 19:41:38) dscassel: cvillaco: Dunno. A lot of it can be done
independantly, tho. 

(2011-08-09 19:41:45) dscassel: Like bug triage. 

(2011-08-09 19:41:46) razorgoto: do you guys keep this channel open
during the jame party in Kwartzlab? 

(2011-08-09 19:42:09) dscassel: It's more fun to do it in groups, but
nothing stopping you otherwise. 

(2011-08-09 19:42:33) BobJonkman: razorgoto: This channel is always
open, but I'll pay special attention during the Jam 

(2011-08-09 19:42:37) dscassel: razorgoto: Sure. Actually, I'm in here
all the time. Often idle, but still online. 

(2011-08-09 19:42:59) razorgoto: Sorry, you know what I mean by "open". 

(2011-08-09 19:43:13) ***psema4mobile is back 

(2011-08-09 19:43:22) dscassel: You can check the Kwartzlab webcam here:
http://www.ustream.tv/channel/kwartzlab 

(2011-08-09 19:43:23) BobJonkman: Yes, "paying attention to" :-) 

(2011-08-09 19:43:34) razorgoto: Yep, Bob. :-) 

(2011-08-09 19:43:40) dscassel: (I guess it's offline at the moment.
I'll kick it when the meeting's over) 

(2011-08-09 19:44:22) BobJonkman: I learned about Big Blue Button at
KWLUG yesterday, maybe we can set up a conference 

(2011-08-09 19:44:27) dscassel: cvillaco: If you really want to go to a
jam, you can run one. :) 

(2011-08-09 19:44:49) cvillaco: is thee ppl interested in participating
remotely? 

(2011-08-09 19:45:24) cvillaco: ohh, haha, 

(2011-08-09 19:45:32) cvillaco: maybe such a thing is possible. 

(2011-08-09 19:45:57) razorgoto: I think so. cvillaco. 

(2011-08-09 19:46:13) dscassel: cvillaco: An Ubuntu hour would be an
easier place to start, but hey, it's still not that bad running a Jam. 

(2011-08-09 19:46:33) razorgoto: cvillaco: where are you in Canada? 

(2011-08-09 19:46:37) dscassel: See http://wiki.ubuntu.com/Jams 

(2011-08-09 19:46:39) cvillaco: i think i would be int3erested in
observing first before making concrete actions. 

(2011-08-09 19:46:45) BobJonkman: About half-way between a Jam and an
Hour is a Release Party 

(2011-08-09 19:47:00) BobJonkman: in complexity, that is 

(2011-08-09 19:47:02) cvillaco: maybe watch a jam first or something. 

(2011-08-09 19:47:20) cvillaco: razorgoto i am in Thunder Bay On 

(2011-08-09 19:47:50) razorgoto: cvillaco: I think the same as you. It's
hard to know how to organize something properly if one has never been to
one before... 

(2011-08-09 19:48:18) dscassel: cvillaco: I've seen a couple Thunder Bay
people come and go through the channel and IRC. 

(2011-08-09 19:48:48) razorgoto: I think it's the logistics of it. Is
the organizer reponsible to "find something for people to do?" 

(2011-08-09 19:49:10) dscassel: And you might be able to tempt
tonyyarusso to come up from Minnesota... 

(2011-08-09 19:49:24) razorgoto: Or would the jam participants be mostly
self-directed... I read the website before, and it wasn't to clear the
social conventions of one. 

(2011-08-09 19:49:43) dscassel: razorgoto: I haven't really figured that
one out either. 

(2011-08-09 19:49:47) dscassel: So mostly self-directed. 

(2011-08-09 19:49:59) dscassel: We have an actual project we're going to
work on this time. 

(2011-08-09 19:50:10) dscassel: But there's nothing that comes down from
the mothership. 

(2011-08-09 19:50:20) dscassel: Last time there was stuff about testing
Unity. 

(2011-08-09 19:50:26) dscassel: Time before that tehy wanted install
testing. 

(2011-08-09 19:50:33) BobJonkman: For me, at the Jams, installing a Beta
has always resulted in bugs to report. 

(2011-08-09 19:50:46) dscassel: Yeah, that's not a bad place to start. 

(2011-08-09 19:50:50) razorgoto: BobJonkman: :-) 

(2011-08-09 19:51:33) BobJonkman: So I've kept myself busy that way. I
may have triaged one bug in the last 3 Jams.. 

(2011-08-09 19:51:49) dscassel: razorgoto: You guys doing anything for
Software Freedom Day? 

(2011-08-09 19:52:01) dscassel: That would seem to be up Free Geek's
alley. :) 

(2011-08-09 19:52:24) razorgoto: nope. 

(2011-08-09 19:52:27) razorgoto: :-( 

(2011-08-09 19:53:30) razorgoto: We've been internally focused the last
few months. We have this whole "facilities management" side of the
operations. 

(2011-08-09 19:53:53) dscassel: razorgoto: No worries. 

(2011-08-09 19:53:54) razorgoto: that's been taking up a lot of time.
:-( 

(2011-08-09 19:54:19) BobJonkman: SFD is always on a Saturday, so you
could just put up some posters and talk about software freedom in the
ordinary course of events 

(2011-08-09 19:55:13) dscassel: According to the website
(http://softwarefreedomday.org/) there are events in Victoria, Winnipeg,
Kitchener (hosted by chaslinux again), Pickering, montreal and Quebec. 

(2011-08-09 19:56:08) razorgoto: Pickering? 

(2011-08-09 19:56:17) dscassel: Yeah, I know! 

(2011-08-09 19:56:37) razorgoto: lol!

org/2011/Canada/Pickering/Ontario/Pickering%20Public%20Library%20Main 

(2011-08-09 19:57:36) psema4mobile: cool, at the library even! 

(2011-08-09 19:57:46) dscassel: There *should* be events everywhere. :) 

(2011-08-09 19:57:57) razorgoto: I wonder which library branch is that? 

(2011-08-09 19:58:13) dscassel: Main, apparently. 

(2011-08-09 19:58:41) cvillaco: maybe bringing some ubuntu posters or
informative pamplets to such events would introduce people who are using
proprietary solutions to the idea of a free software operating system, 

(2011-08-09 19:59:19) razorgoto: Oh, I know the person that runs that
library... 

(2011-08-09 19:59:25) BobJonkman: razorgoto: What can you tell us about
FSOSS? 

(2011-08-09 19:59:51) BobJonkman: Specifically, the LinuxFest that goes
along with FSOSS this year? 

(2011-08-09 20:00:04) razorgoto: Well, we're doing this thing with
Seneca this year. 

(2011-08-09 20:00:38) razorgoto: They do FSOSS every year and they have
the space, resources, people and volunteers to manage and plan a big
event. 

(2011-08-09 20:01:08) BobJonkman: Are you still accepting speakers for
LinuxFest? 

(2011-08-09 20:01:08) razorgoto: Basically, it will be at Seneca @
York... so not in Scarborough. 

(2011-08-09 20:01:17) razorgoto: Bob, totally. 

(2011-08-09 20:01:29) dscassel: razorgoto: I put in my proposal. :) 

(2011-08-09 20:01:44) razorgoto: Actually, we had a dearth of speakers
this year so far. 

(2011-08-09 20:02:02) razorgoto: I am encouraging everyone I know to
join. 

(2011-08-09 20:02:38) razorgoto: We are also, on top of the conference,
doing an unconference on the last day. 

(2011-08-09 20:03:20) razorgoto: So that will be more a breakout time to
do more workshops and conferences. Maybe of a more impromptu nature. 

(2011-08-09 20:03:32) dscassel: Cool. 

(2011-08-09 20:04:19) dscassel: Well, it's after 8. 

(2011-08-09 20:04:45) razorgoto: time does fly swiftly. 

(2011-08-09 20:04:49) dscassel: Oneiric is out Oct. 13 so get planning
release parties! 

(2011-08-09 20:04:57) BobJonkman: Before we break up, any words on
Oneiric's Release Party? 

(2011-08-09 20:05:01) BobJonkman: :) 

(2011-08-09 20:05:24) dscassel: BobJonkman: We'll have one in Kwartzlab.
I'm hoping there's a Toronto one again. :) 

(2011-08-09 20:05:27) razorgoto: Oneiric is the LTS. Right? 

(2011-08-09 20:05:32) dscassel: I haven't heard about any others. 

(2011-08-09 20:05:38) dscassel: razorgoto: Nope. 12.04 is LTS. 

(2011-08-09 20:05:38) SIR_Taco: anything in Kingston? haha 

(2011-08-09 20:05:42) psema4mobile: There can only be ONEiric! 

(2011-08-09 20:05:50) razorgoto: lol. 

(2011-08-09 20:05:51) dscassel: SIR_Taco: If you hold one there will be.
:D 

(2011-08-09 20:06:04) BobJonkman: Ubuntu Release Parties are easy to
arrange. 

(2011-08-09 20:06:15) razorgoto: The last Ubuntu Release party was great
fun here in Toronto. 

(2011-08-09 20:06:19) BobJonkman: The toughest part is getting the
Ubuntu logo on the Devilled Eggs! 

(2011-08-09 20:06:26) dscassel: Probably better Oneiric isn't an LTS.
Don't want to have to keep trying to pronounce it for 5 years. 

(2011-08-09 20:06:33) SIR_Taco: dscassel: been holding my breath for
awhile now haha 

(2011-08-09 20:06:46) razorgoto: I will try to get in touch with Mike to
see if he will be doing it again. 

(2011-08-09 20:07:15) dscassel: razorgoto: Great! 

(2011-08-09 20:07:44) dscassel: SIR_Taco: There's gotta be at least a
couple Ubuntu users at Queen's... 

(2011-08-09 20:08:09) BobJonkman: SIR_Taco: Just make an announcement,
gather in some local establishment, and burn some CDs from the new ISO 

(2011-08-09 20:08:26) BobJonkman: It might turn into an installfest if
people bring laptops 

(2011-08-09 20:08:41) psema4mobile: Im afraid I need to drop off.
battery's getting pretty low. Nice to meet you all! 

(2011-08-09 20:08:53) dscassel: Or just, you know, hang out. :) 

(2011-08-09 20:09:00) psema4mobile: BobJonkman catch up with you soon? 

(2011-08-09 20:09:04) dscassel: psema4mobile: No problem thanks for
coming out. :) 

(2011-08-09 20:09:06) BobJonkman: Just the thought that it's legal to
burn CDs of an operating system is news to some people 

(2011-08-09 20:09:16) psema4mobile: l8tr 

(2011-08-09 20:09:20) psema4mobile left the room (quit: Quit: AndroIRC).

(2011-08-09 20:09:26) BobJonkman: OK psema4mobile, talk to you soon 

(2011-08-09 20:10:01) razorgoto: gotta say the oneric is hard to
spell... 

(2011-08-09 20:10:10) SIR_Taco: that's possible 

(2011-08-09 20:12:33) BobJonkman: dscassel: Do you have a date yet for
the KW URP? 

(2011-08-09 20:14:47) dscassel: Oct 15. 

(2011-08-09 20:14:59) BobJonkman: Yay! 

(2011-08-09 20:15:02) dscassel: (The saturday after release, as per
tradition. 

(2011-08-09 20:15:12) dscassel: (Wait, when's thanksgiving?) 

(2011-08-09 20:15:35) dscassel: (the Monday before. Phew) 

(2011-08-09 20:15:36) BobJonkman: 10 Oct 

(2011-08-09 20:15:37) SIR_Taco: the weekend before that 

(2011-08-09 20:15:58) SIR_Taco: oooh, I'm a birthday turkey again this
year haha 

(2011-08-09 20:16:22) dscassel: SIR_Taco: heh. :) 

(2011-08-09 20:18:36) razorgoto: guys, I've been at work long enough. My
Windows computer just crashed. I am going home. 

(2011-08-09 20:19:35) razorgoto: I emailed some people at Free Geek
about taking on more activities next two months so we can do some of
these stuff in Toronto (Center of Universe.) 

(2011-08-09 20:20:09) razorgoto: See you later. 

(2011-08-09 20:20:46) SIR_Taco: cya razorgoto 

(2011-08-09 20:21:15) SIR_Taco: I always miss the meeting haha

(2011-08-09 20:22:09) razorgoto: bye 

(2011-08-09 20:22:12) razorgoto left the room (quit: Quit: leaving). 

(2011-08-09 20:32:23) dscassel: Thanks for coming out, guys. :) 

(2011-08-09 20:37:54) cyphermox: dscassel, poke 

(2011-08-09 20:38:01) cyphermox: sorry, just finished reading backlog 

(2011-08-09 20:38:41) cyphermox: dscassel: might be worth pointing out
LinuxConNA next week in Vancouver (I'll be heading out to there on
Tuesday) 

(2011-08-09 20:39:08) cyphermox: dscassel: also, please ping me if
you're in Montreal on Monday or before, maybe I can make time 

(2011-08-09 20:46:17) dscassel: cyphermox: Oh yeah! 

(2011-08-09 20:46:31) dscassel: There's an open source thing in Ottawa
in a couple weeks too. 

(2011-08-09 20:46:35) dscassel: With rms and everything. 

(2011-08-09 20:46:39) cyphermox: fun fun 

(2011-08-09 20:47:41) bregma: wait, what? 

(2011-08-09 20:48:07) bregma: what open source thing in Ottawa? I might
convince my company to pay 

(2011-08-09 20:49:11) dscassel: bregma: hold on.. 

(2011-08-09 20:55:42) dscassel: bregma: Found it! 

(2011-08-09 20:55:49) cyphermox: yay for stuff in Ottawa. this is within
driveable distance within a day :) 

(2011-08-09 20:55:57) dscassel: http://fosslc.org/drupal/sc2011 

(2011-08-09 20:56:19) dscassel: I'll actually be in Ottawa on the 27th,
but I've got a train ticket that leaves at 1pm. :( 

(2011-08-09 20:57:22) dscassel: Funny, tho, that the fsf where's rms
page doesn't list it. 

(2011-08-09 20:57:45) dscassel: It says he's suppoed to be in the UK
that week. 

(2011-08-09 20:59:58) dscassel: BTW, a little bit of self-promotion I
forgot to do at the meeting, I'm putting myself up for Ubuntu membership
next week, if you're interested in giving me a testamonial... 

(2011-08-09 21:00:01) dscassel: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/dscassel 

(2011-08-09 21:00:20) cyphermox: dscassel: absolutely, thanks for
bringing it up 

(2011-08-09 21:00:28) cyphermox: i thought the meeting was this week
though 

(2011-08-09 21:01:05) cyphermox: I stand corrected 

(2011-08-09 21:05:44) bregma: dang, August 27 is my brother's 50th
birthday party in Hamilton, I can't miss that 

(2011-08-09 21:13:19) dscassel: bregma: Maybe your brother will want to
meet St IGNUcious for his birthday... :) 

(2011-08-09 21:14:28) bregma: unlikely 

(2011-08-09 22:18:58) khoover: did i miss everything? 

(2011-08-09 22:20:13) dscassel: khoover: There's always something. :) 

(2011-08-09 22:20:23) ***dscassel may be lying... 

(2011-08-09 22:20:51) dscassel: Still, if there's anything you want to
bring up, I haven't done the minutes yet.
