== Ubuntu Marketing Video #1 "Burned" ==

          INT. A CLASSROOM - DAY
          Large print notice of school policy regarding software
          piracy fills screen. "OFFENDERS WILL BE EXPELLED"
          Pan to one side to reveal an unlit computer science
          classroom except for the glow of a single CRT. Dark shadows
          lurk in the glow of the monitor.

                              VOICE 1:
                    Shhh, hey man, come on. Can't you burn
                    that CD any faster?

                              VOICE 2:
                    It's almost done. Just hang on.

                              VOICE 3:
                    Yeah, but you got to make mine next and
                    we're almost out of time. I need that
                    copy of Office so that I can get my
                    report done next week.

                              VOICE 1:
                    I want the new operating system update.
                    He he, I'll never have to pay Norton for
                    their Anti-virus service again. This is
                    great man where did you get all this
                    software from?

                              VOICE 4:
                    Shhh, keep your voice down. I downloaded
                    over the Internet of course. With Peer
                    to Peer technology there is a world of
                    software, music and movies at your
                    disposal. And it's all free. People are
                    really dumb to be spending money on this
                    sort of stuff. I haven't paid for
                    software in years.

                              VOICE 1:
                    Is it done yet?

                              VOICE 4:
                    Yup, here ya'go.

          Hands voice 1 a CD. Lights suddenly come on and a
          teacher and the principal come in with stern
          expressions on their face.

                              PRINCIPAL:
                    What are you boys doing in here?

                              VOICE 1:
                    Ah sorry sir, we were just leaving.

          Long pause, boys try to make for the door, but are
          blocked by TEACHER and PRINCIPLE.

                              VOICE 1:
                    (after another long pause) Oh sorry....
                    Err. here's your copy of Ubuntu back.

          VOICE 1 hands original CD to teacher and all 4 run
          out the door)

                              TEACHER:
                    (Yelling) Next time don't come in here
                    during recess without telling a teacher
                    first. (softer) Well, at least they're
                    sharing some good software.

                              ANNOUNCER:
                    Ubuntu, Software for humans.... All of
                    them. Copy....  Share.... Enjoy....
=== Notes on approach ===

The following MUST be decided before production can begin.
==== Pre-production ====
* Determine budget:
** How much can be obtained for free? 
** Does anyone have any connections?
** How much money would people be willing to spend/ donate to this project?
* Determine format:
** Most likely video as the cost of film is beyond the preliminary budget.
* Review script
* Location scout
** High school. One possibility is Woburn C.I. (Markham and Elsemere). Andrew Hunter has connections there and could get us in for free, but after-hours. 
* Casting:
** Most likely friends of the crew (shudder)...
==== Post-production ====
