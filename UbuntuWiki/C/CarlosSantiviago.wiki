<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/IconCalendarOpen.png]]</nowiki>

Since i'm a Brazilian one, i plan to help as much as possible to get Ubuntu rocking in my native language. However, as i love the security field, i'll try to make some security-related packages to Ubuntu.

In the beginning of 2006, i started making packages, as i wanna be a developer too. Here is the list:
