== * Organize Grub menu better ==

I suggest to make the grub menu more modular, using sub-menus.

In the main menu there should only be the most minimal and clean boot options,
means only the last Linux kernel (without kernel version in the line), and Windows if exists.

There will be also a sub-menu named "Other boot options", in which there will be the Failsafe boot, memory check and all the other kernels (old kernels or other flavors).

There should be a graphical GUI, that will let the user organize Grub to better fits his needs, by adding, removing and editing menus and sub-menus, and editing all the options of /boot/grub/menu.list .

It's also about time, that the menu will be graphical and less ugly...

* Switch to GRUB2 ??
* or use Grub-gfxboot just like Mepis, Suse and others... ?
