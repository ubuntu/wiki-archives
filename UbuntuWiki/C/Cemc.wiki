__TOC__

My name is Imre Gergely (<nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~cemc|on Launchpad]]</nowiki>), I live in Romania and I've been using Linux for a couple of years now.

I've been actively involved in Ubuntu for the past year, with debugging, some packaging, package testing and backporting.

I can be contacted through email, IRC and other IMs.

=== Contributions ===
* testing various packages (mainly clamav backporting and related packages), see <nowiki>[[MOTU-Clamav]]</nowiki> (the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MOTU/Clamav?action=info|info page]]</nowiki> for a more detailed look)
* some bugreporting/bug triaging
* minor patching (again clamav-related)
* helping out on ubuntu-server mailing list, in #ubuntu-server on Freenode
* running an <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+mirror/ftp.astral.ro-archive|official Ubuntu mirror]]</nowiki> (<nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+mirror/ftp.astral.ro-release|releases]]</nowiki>) in Romania

=== Contacts ===
* email: <code>gimre at narancs dot net</code>
* IRC: <code>cemc</code> on FreeNode (usually in <code>#ubuntu-server</code>, <code>#ubuntu-motu</code>) or OFTC (<code>#debian-clamav</code>)
* other IMs: Yahoo, MSN, ICQ, gtalk (ask for them if you need to contact me faster)

=== Plans for the future ===
No big plans, just trying to help out, time permitting.
