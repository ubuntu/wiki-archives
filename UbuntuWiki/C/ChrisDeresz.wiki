Hi.  My name's Chris.  I live in New Jersey and work in Business Development.

I have been contributing where I can with English to Italian translations for Ubuntu packages.  

Lately I've been playing with virtualization using VirtualBox (www.virtualbox.org).  I don't think it's as fast as VMWare, but the usability is a 10.  I'm running Ubuntu 7.04 right now on one laptop through VirtualBox and Ubuntu 7.10 on my desktop.
