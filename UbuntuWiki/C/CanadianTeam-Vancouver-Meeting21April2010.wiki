Our meeting planning is in full swing!

We'll have sizzling Lightning Talks. Stuff that makes people want to try Ubuntu. Stuff that inspires!

Our theme is loosely about accelerating Ubuntu adoption... 

Stay tuned, and see you soon.

=== Astounding April Acceleration! ===

You are encouraged to read the whole page. If you don't have the time, here's the stuff to remember:<<BR>><<BR>>
a. '''RSVP'''. It's really important and it's polite. http://www.meetup.com/ubuntuvancouver/calendar/13136747/ <<BR>>
b. We start promptly at '''6:30pm'''. Location below (see "Where"). Please don't arrive too early though. Doors are generally locked until about 6:10-ish to give the meeting crew time to configure the space, to rehearse and to set-up.<<BR>>
c. The meeting is about building '''local community''', not just software.<<BR>>
d. '''Sharing''' food and drinks helps build community. Please bring some! ("Note A" below)<<BR>>
e. Bring a chair if you can. This is going to be another full house. ("Note C" below)<<BR>>

=== Some Background Information ===
'''Ubuntu is all about community'''. Our meetings are designed to be friendly, welcoming, and non-intimidating for '''all'''. No computer experience is assumed or required. We meet to share ideas about freedom in computing through the use of Ubuntu and also to build relationships in our community that transcend the stereotypical "user group" or "computer club". Sure, there are "computer clubs" in Vancouver. This isn't one of them ;)

In this spirit of being different, friendly, and in support of our goal to make the Ubuntu Vancouver community the largest in the world, please consider bringing a guest or two to this meeting. (Ideally someone who normally wouldn't attend a "computer club" type of event: a friend, significant other, family member.) We promise to make it interesting for everyone who attends! And don't forget to add them to your RSVP if they're not already a meetup member.

'''Our Theme for the evening Astounding April Acceleration.''' April marks the retirement of our beloved Koala and the imminent birth of a fast new mascot! One that is set to race through Vancouver.

=== Agenda (Proposed) ===
We are gathering a '''great''' line-up of speakers and topics.

==== Lightning Talk: "TBD" ====
A sizzling Ubuntu presentation!
==== Break = Socializing + Refreshments ====
Our members meet, mingle and enjoy the food and beverages (see Note A below) that everyone brought to share. Some members laugh uncontrollably. Everyone is encouraged to find a new face, start a conversation and to make everyone feel welcomed. (Note that this meeting will not include our usual RescueCentre due to the proximity of our upcoming SupportSaturday event. If you need help, please check the meetup calendar and RSVP for SupportSaturday.)
Would you like to "Chime In? Sign-in during the break and get on the agenda.
==== Rapid Lightning Talk: UGH! ====
A quick highlight of Ubuntu games!

'''Plans sometimes change''', so please '''RSVP above''' to ensure that you are updated in the event we need to move to bigger space, or for any other important news about this meeting. Your RSVP is also a polite way to help us plan.
=== Important Notes ===
==== a. Treats ====
Many members bring '''treats''' to share with everyone, potluck style during the break. It's not required, but we certainly welcome it, as it helps create a more friendly environment for socializing, especially given that many people come to our meetings directly from work. And, if you're not comfortable preparing or sharing drinks/food for others, please consider picking something up from your nearest supermarket, bakery, pub on the way over.  (Examples of what members have brought to previous meetings: sandwiches, sushi rolls, cupcakes, muffins, veggies, cookies, tangerines, nuts, coffee, tea, juice, pop, wine, ... the list is growing!)
==== b. Rescue Centre ====
'''We're deferring the Rescue Centre to Support Saturday.''' Normally: In parallel with the latter half of the meeting we host a '''Rescue Centre.''' If you have an Ubuntu issue that you just can't seem to figure out, this will be the place for you! Expert(s) will be on hand to help triage issues and to provide suggestions. (Please remember to RSVP with a comment on the type of assistance that you will need. Also remember that this is time-limited so it's probably not realistic to expect a complete reinstall or something very detailed. For intense help, consider coming to a Support Saturday.)
==== c. Chairs ====
We never seem to have enough. If you are driving, please consider throwing an extra folding chair (or two) in your trunk on the way over. We promise not to hurt them, and the meeting is more comfortable when everyone has a seat.
==== d. Still Want More? ====
After the meeting some members continue socializing nearby on "The Drive". For those who want to mingle with Ubuntu Vancouver LoCo folks, in a less formal (restaurant/patio) setting, please plan to join us after the meeting. (If there is an "after-event", the venue will be announced as part of the meeting wrap-up.)
