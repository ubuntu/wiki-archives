* 2012-12-06 meeting:
** Meeting log: http://ubottu.com/meetingology/logs/ubuntu-meeting/2012/ubuntu-meeting.2012-12-06-17.02.html
** Catch up with Lubuntu team and Edubuntu team
** Lubuntu had great feedback on the 12.10 release.
** Both are generally doing well, both could do with some more help from the development side. 
** Daniel offered both to be on the Ubuntu Development Hangout.
** No pressing issues or anything else the CC could help out with.
* 2012-12-20 meeting:
** Meeting log: http://ubottu.com/meetingology/logs/ubuntu-meeting/2012/ubuntu-meeting.2012-12-20-17.00.html
** Catch up with the Translations team
** Translations team representative kelemengabor felt the translations process last release was a little buggy compared to Precise 
** The team lacks leadership since dpm's job focus was changed (without someone pushing things forward, things tend to not move forward)
*** Proposal: clone dpm ;)
** Gwaihir mentioned that this might be a good opportunity to open up a little bit the ubuntu-translation-coordinators team
** Explained that they don't have milestones, but there are things that need to be done at certain times in the release cycle (opening up translations, setting up langpack export&build, cleaning the import queue) but these are not formalized
** Things are driven and teams are motivated by translations statistics page
** Discussed possibilities for more collaboration between teams to share best practices - some is done in bug reports, IRC meetings tend to be hard due to time zones
** Translations team agreed to have an internal meeting to discuss some of the current challenges and dholbach took an action to mail the translations team again about a scheduling a date in 2013 to check in again
** teolemon pointed out starting http://lite.framapad.org/p/ddtpUbuntu
** Rescheduling meeting with Forums Council because none were available for this meeting
