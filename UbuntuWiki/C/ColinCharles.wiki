__TOC__

Things I've done that will interest the Ubuntu community:

* ran OSS-101 back in 2001 (december) right up till around 2003. It was a 16-hour course (initially 24-hour) that got people (even those unfamiliar with Linux) up to scratch with using Red Hat Linux 8 (and then later RHL9). I would like to re-do this for Ubuntu

* Training LiveCD - done for the <nowiki>[[http://www.iosn.net/|IOSN]]</nowiki> which is a United Nations Development Programme body. It is based off Ubuntu, and includes training materials like: a end user guide (that I co-wrote), Flash presentation as well as premiers on the open source movement. Its still in a beta release stage, and will be released soon

Otherwise, I'm a Fedora hacker, finding Ubuntu/Canonical rather interesting at the moment... There's actually focus!
