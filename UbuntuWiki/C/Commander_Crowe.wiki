About me: My name is Thomas Crowe and I've been into computers all my life. I'm currently running FC5 and Xubuntu. I've had experience with many Linux flavors. I'm learning Python at the moment and I have a familiar background with Shell Scripting. I'm often found in the IRC freenode server in the Xubuntu support channel.
