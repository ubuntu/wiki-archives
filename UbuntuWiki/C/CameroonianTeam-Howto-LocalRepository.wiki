=== Context ===
In cameroon, we still not have internet everywhere and with a good bandwidth. It's very difficult to install and update a GNU/Linux distribution when you cannot connect your machine to the internet.

=== Goal ===
One workaround to counter the issue stated above is to deal with local repository .
You or a friend build packages and all the necessary file from a machine connected to the internet . You bring back that repository to your home and install/update from that source :) .

=== Resources ===
I will based this help from https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Personal and explain how I have adapt it to my needs.
