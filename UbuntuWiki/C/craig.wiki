Hi! My name is Craig. I'm a member of Ubuntu Vancouver (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CanadianTeam/Vancouver/). My goals in promoting Ubuntu Linux is primarily to advocate the usage of Free/Open Source Software. Often, I accomplish this by illustrating the elegance of UNIX-based systems and how its innate transparency helps users better understand what computing is about, and how everybody can benefit from its facilities--not just computer-wizzes.

I am also a Mac user, and although I think Apple does a very good job of making computing easy for users with its innovative designs and great user interfaces, its original values from 60s counter-culture have been corrupted beyond recognition. I believe that the Free and Open source communities, and ultimately the Ubuntu community still holds these values, and can help educate people about great software without compromising freedoms or liberties.
