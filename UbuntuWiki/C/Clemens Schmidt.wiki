==== Learning ====
On the programming side: I'm currently participating in some classes on the Ubuntu Beginners Development Team.
And I'm trying to learn Spanish right now. 

=== Why using Ubuntu? ===
Hm, that's a difficult one... well, because it's open source, it looks and works great, and it's simply awesome.
