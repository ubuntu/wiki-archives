(2011-07-12 19:14:52) hakimsheriff: to be able to see it 

(2011-07-12 19:15:03) KombuchaKip: BobJonkman: Ubuntu forum I think you
have to sign in to see message attachments. 

Unknown command. 

(2011-07-12 19:15:16) dscassel: KombuchaKip: Huh. Is that all rendered,
or just the lander superimposed on Mars photos? 

(2011-07-12 19:15:23) ***BobJonkman grumbles about yet more logging
inning 

(2011-07-12 19:15:55) KombuchaKip: dscassel / BobJonkman: It's real.
Very exciting. Details on how we got it out here:
https://www.avaneya.com/temp/Avaneya%20Crew%20Handbook.pdf

(2011-07-12 19:17:57) ***txwikinger is on his way 

(2011-07-12 19:18:59) dscassel: KombuchaKip: That's cool. I was assuming
Avaneya was just the game. 

(2011-07-12 19:19:06) dscassel: See you soon, txwikinger :) 

(2011-07-12 19:19:17) dscassel: Okay, we don't have much of an agenda
today, but we should get started... 

(2011-07-12 19:19:23) KombuchaKip: dscassel: It is, but we needed the
Viking Lander images to make the material shaders realistic. 

(2011-07-12 19:19:50) dscassel: Events! 

(2011-07-12 19:20:19) ***BobJonkman grumbles that he has to log into

(2011-07-12 19:20:23) BobJonkman: Sorry. 

(2011-07-12 19:20:38) dscassel: Ubuntu Global Jam is coming up September
2-4. 

(2011-07-12 19:20:58) dscassel: We're going to host a jam here at
Kwartzlab (the hackerspace in KW) 

(2011-07-12 19:21:02) KombuchaKip: BobJonkman: Don't worry. Soon we'll
have them all in PNG for you to download. 

(2011-07-12 19:21:36) dscassel: There seemed to be interest in hosting
one in Toronto at Free Geek, but I haven't heard what's going on with
that. 

(2011-07-12 19:21:48) dscassel: I need to hunt down a point contact
person there. 

(2011-07-12 19:22:19) dscassel: If people want to run one, it's pretty
fun. 

(2011-07-12 19:22:35) dscassel: Not as easy as an Ubuntu Hour, but a
great way to get people contributing to the project. 

(2011-07-12 19:22:58) dscassel: Anybody running (heard about) other
Jams? 

(2011-07-12 19:24:08) dscassel: I'm assuming that's a no. 

(2011-07-12 19:24:27) zeroedout: nope :) 

(2011-07-12 19:24:34) hakimsheriff: nope 

(2011-07-12 19:24:39) fhassouneh: nope 

(2011-07-12 19:24:44) dscassel: hakimsheriff: Nothing in Montreal? 

(2011-07-12 19:25:02) hakimsheriff: dscassel: not sure 

(2011-07-12 19:25:28) dscassel: (Quebec has its own loco, but I like to
know these things so I can tell people about them if they ask. :) 

(2011-07-12 19:25:54) hakimsheriff: Im not very involved with Ubuntu
Quebec 

(2011-07-12 19:26:17) dscassel: hakimsheriff: Still haven't made it out
to an Ubuntu hour, eh? 

(2011-07-12 19:26:25) hakimsheriff: not really, 

(2011-07-12 19:26:34) hakimsheriff: im currently VERY busy 

(2011-07-12 19:26:37) dscassel: MagicFab's a good guy. I'm looking
forward to meeting him next month. :) 

(2011-07-12 19:27:08) BobJonkman: Are you going to MagicFab, or is
MagicFab coming to KW? 

(2011-07-12 19:27:19) dscassel: BobJonkman: I'm going to Montreal. :) 

(2011-07-12 19:27:53) dscassel: Anyway, Ubuntu Developer Week is on this
week in #ubuntu-classroom. 

(2011-07-12 19:28:04) dscassel:
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDeveloperWeek 

(2011-07-12 19:28:50) dscassel: If you're interested in programming for
or on Ubutu, it's a great place to learn about different technologies
and techniques. 

(2011-07-12 19:29:04) fhassouneh: Thanks a lot dscassel 

(2011-07-12 19:29:28) dscassel: no problem, fhassouneh :) 

(2011-07-12 19:29:31) dscassel: Hope it's helpful. 

(2011-07-12 19:29:40) dscassel: I've attended in the past. 

(2011-07-12 19:29:57) dscassel: I kinda forgot about it this week
(doesn't help I'm at work when it's going). 

(2011-07-12 19:30:12) fhassouneh: oh ok, it should be interesting 

(2011-07-12 19:30:13) dscassel: I'll probably fire up Lernid and have it
running in the backround at work. 

(2011-07-12 19:31:41) dscassel: Ubuntu Vancouver's Randall Ross is
running a similar event: Ubuntu Community Week. 

(2011-07-12 19:31:56) dscassel: Similar, but about building the
community. 

(2011-07-12 19:32:02) sipherdee: dscassel: thanks for mentionning it
again, i am back from vacation so i will check #ubuntu-classroom. 

(2011-07-12 19:32:05) dscassel:
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuCommunityWeek 

(2011-07-12 19:32:15) dscassel: No problem, sipherdee :) 

(2011-07-12 19:32:51) dscassel: It's July 18-22 in #ubuntu-classroom. 

(2011-07-12 19:33:26) dscassel: (Although I think they're pushing
Lernid, because you get slides and it's easier for non-technical
people). 

(2011-07-12 19:33:37) cgroza: Too late for the meeting? 

(2011-07-12 19:34:10) dscassel: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lernid 

(2011-07-12 19:34:17) dscassel: cgroza: Nope! We're still going. 

(2011-07-12 19:34:31) dscassel: Although we're coming to the end of the
posted agenda. 

(2011-07-12 19:35:10) dscassel: Anybody else running, know of events
they'd like to talk about? 

(2011-07-12 19:35:29) BobJonkman: Is the Ubuntu CD Bribery Program still
on? 

(2011-07-12 19:35:34) dscassel: Assuming the answer is no, anything I
can do to convince you it's a good idea? 

(2011-07-12 19:35:43) dscassel: BobJonkman: Yeah, but no bites. 

(2011-07-12 19:36:20) dscassel: Ubuntu CD Bribery Program is I will send
you a package of 10 CDs if you run an Ubuntu Hour in your town, and post
pictures/blog about it. 

(2011-07-12 19:36:28) dscassel: A bargain! 

(2011-07-12 19:36:36) dscassel: I'll probably throw in stickers and
buttons too. :D 

(2011-07-12 19:37:02) BobJonkman: Maybe I can distribute some CDs at
events like the Guelph Web Makers Meetup and the KW Design/Developers
Meetup 

(2011-07-12 19:37:49) hakimsheriff: Be Right Back, 

(2011-07-12 19:38:00) dscassel: Ubuntu Hours are fun and easy! You just
find a nice cafe somewhere, advertise when you're going to be there
(twitter/identica/forums/the mailing list/loco.ubuntu.com) 

(2011-07-12 19:38:43) dscassel: And people show up! You meet other cool
Ubuntu people! And you can make nefarious plans for release parties and
whatnot. :D 

(2011-07-12 19:39:00) dscassel: Or you dont' have to talk about ubuntu
at all, if other things come up. 

(2011-07-12 19:39:08) dscassel: Totally informal. 

(2011-07-12 19:39:14) dscassel: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/Hour/ 

(2011-07-12 19:39:26) BobJonkman: And we have one in KW next Wednesday 

(2011-07-12 19:39:42) dscassel: Yup! 

(2011-07-12 19:39:54) dscassel: BobJonkman: I brought CDs for you to
KWLUG, but you weren't there. :( 

(2011-07-12 19:39:59) dscassel: I'll have some to give you next week. 

(2011-07-12 19:40:00) ***hakimsheriff is back! 

(2011-07-12 19:40:03) dscassel: yay! 

(2011-07-12 19:40:46) BobJonkman: *grins* because #gwmm is tomorrow... 

(2011-07-12 19:40:55) BobJonkman: But #kwdm is the week after Ubuntu
Hour 

(2011-07-12 19:41:02) dscassel: BobJonkman: You should be here! I've got
them in my car. :) 

(2011-07-12 19:42:45) BobJonkman: That'll teach me... 

(2011-07-12 19:42:49) dscassel: fhassouneh: You should totally run an
Ubuntu Hour in St John's. 

(2011-07-12 19:43:01) dscassel: Anything else anyone wants to talk
about? 

(2011-07-12 19:43:39) fhassouneh: dscassel: I think its a great idea, i
think i'll run one soon, i just need some information and ill definitely
find some ppl to help me here 

(2011-07-12 19:43:52) dscassel: fhassouneh: Great! 

(2011-07-12 19:44:02) dscassel: Yeah, see if you can get in touch with
rgreening. :D 

(2011-07-12 19:44:25) dscassel: And let me know if you have any
questions about it. There's really nothing to it. 

(2011-07-12 19:44:56) fhassouneh: ok i think it will be a fun experience

(2011-07-12 19:45:15) dscassel: We gotta get one going regularly in
Linuxcaffe in Toronto. I should poke the Free Geek guys. 

(2011-07-12 19:45:15) fhassouneh: by the way all the computers at
memorial univerity have ubuntu 8.04 installed on them 

(2011-07-12 19:45:34) dscassel: fhassouneh: Yeah, that's where U
Waterloo is too. 

(2011-07-12 19:45:53) fhassouneh: dscassel: yeah thats awesome 

(2011-07-12 19:46:14) dscassel: I'm just happy I'm able to run Ubuntu at
work now. No more Windows! :D 

(2011-07-12 19:47:09) BobJonkman: I've been running rogue Ubuntu at work
for about 6 months. 

(2011-07-12 19:47:44) dscassel: BobJonkman: I'm making it possible for
other developers to run Ubuntu at work too. :D 

(2011-07-12 19:48:16) BobJonkman: Need Virtual Box to run WinXP for
MS-only apps like OneNote and Exchange (because the Exchange server is
too damaged to properly deal with UTF-8 in SMTP) 

(2011-07-12 19:48:18) dscassel: Our old IDE is Windows-only. I'm making
a new cross-platform one based on Eclipse. :D 

(2011-07-12 19:49:02) dscassel: BobJonkman: Yeah. I need IE for a few
things still. 

(2011-07-12 19:49:34) dscassel: I installed Crossover Pro trial to get
Office running because I need to mark up Word docs sometimes. 

(2011-07-12 19:50:16) dscassel: (I'm thinking the meeting is pretty much
over, btw. But I'll be around for a bit if anyone wants to chat) 

(2011-07-12 19:50:17) BobJonkman: I'm hoping the money argument will win
over management types to adopt Linux - no OS license fees, no server
license fees, no application license fees... 

(2011-07-12 19:50:48) dscassel: BobJonkman: For us, we support Linux for
our customers, but developers aren't testing it. 

(2011-07-12 19:50:58) BobJonkman: Maybe we should form a special
interest group, the Ubuntu Rogues 

(2011-07-12 19:51:00) fhassouneh: nice to meet everyone today, sand I'll
keep u all updated about the ubuntu hour :) 

(2011-07-12 19:51:03) fhassouneh: have to go now 

(2011-07-12 19:51:09) dscassel: Getting developers developing on Linux
cuts down on embarassing bugs. 

(2011-07-12 19:51:11) BobJonkman: Bye fhassouneh! 

(2011-07-12 19:51:23) dscassel: See you, fhassouneh. thanks for coming
out. :) 

(2011-07-12 19:52:14) fhassouneh: dscassel: see you 

(2011-07-12 19:52:23) hakimsheriff: fhassouneh: Goodbye! 

(2011-07-12 19:58:54) dscassel: BobJonkman: Ubuntu Rogues. I like that.
Infiltrate and assimilate. :D 

(2011-07-12 20:00:33) BobJonkman: I envision the Rogues with cloth caps
at jaunty angles, silk scarves trailing in the wind, and black leather
jackets so shiny you can see your reflection. 

(2011-07-12 20:04:57) BobJonkman: Almost, but perhaps not entirely
unlike

(2011-07-12 20:08:50) BobJonkman: OK, if the fun and frivolity is at an
end, then this Rogue must go shopping before the stores close. 

(2011-07-12 20:08:58) BobJonkman: Bye all! 

(2011-07-12 20:16:42) dscassel: See you, BobJonkman_AFK :)
