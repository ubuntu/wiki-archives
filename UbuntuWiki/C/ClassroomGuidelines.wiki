== Guidelines for Ubuntu Classroom ==

=== 1.  How to get involved and procedures ===

     This article describes the procedures required to teach or run a
     class or session in #ubuntu-classroom.

=== 1.1 Before the Class ===
==== 1.1.1 Adding yourself to the instructors list ====
     
     To teach a class, you must be knowledgeable about the subject you wish to teach.
     You may then add your wiki name as an instructor to the class 
     you would like to teach, as long as there are no more than 2
     instructors teaching any one class at any one time.
     Once you have decided upon a topic, the table of topics must be updated following this example:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <:>'''Date'''
| <:>'''Time'''
| <:>'''Class Topic'''
| <:>'''Instructor(s)'''
|-
| Aug 5^th^ and 6^th^
| 18:00GMT, 04:00GMT
| Introduction to Internet Relay Chat (IRC)
| Bob (KDE) <> Alice (CLI)
|-
| Aug 19^th^ and 20^th^
| 18:00GMT, 04:00GMT
| Introduction to Command Line Interface (Terminal)
| John (GNOME) <> Mark (KDE)
|}
  
==== 1.1.2 Submitting a Class Outline ====
     
     Each instructor (or group of instructors) must submit a rough
     plan of the material covered in their class to the <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/Ubuntu-classroom|Ubuntu Classroom Mailing List]]</nowiki>, at the very latest,
     a week and a half before the class is held.
     This will then be reviewed to make sure that the class is being 
     taught by someone knowledgeable and to make sure that no-one is stuck
     at the last minute looking for someone to teach. The preview will then be
     posted onto the wiki as a preview of the upcoming course. 
     The instructor(s) may also do the latter themselves if they feel so inclined.

==== 1.1.3 Getting the channel ready ====

     The instructors should ask an operator of the channel
### ubuntu-classroom to set a topic announcing the subject,
     the date, and the time of the upcoming class.
     The instructors should then be opped by a channel operator
     shortly before the class.
     A minute or two before the class begins, the instructor may
     set the channel to +m (moderated) or keep the discussion open and unmoderated.     

=== 1.2 During the Class ===
     
     This section describes procedures for during a class, such as how
     to ask questions effectively, etc. 
  
==== 1.2.1 Questions ====

     Depending on the preferences of the instructor, classes may be held in a moderated (+m) channel.  Questions during the class will be directed toward the moderator. In other words, at the beginning of the class, the instructor will say something similar to this:
	"Please /msg <moderator> with all questions. They will then voice 
	 you in your turn and you will be able to ask your question in this
	 channel."
     If the classes are held unmoderated, users are expected to be polite and use their common sense when asking questions and engaging the instructor (wait until other answers are answered before asking theirs, be patient with answers, etc).

==== 1.2.2 Time ====

     Each class should last around an hour, up to a maximum of two hours,
     with a minimum of half an hour.
     The length of the class is determined by the amount of material
     covered by the instructors, by the amount of questions asked, etc.

=== 1.3 After the Class ===
 
    This section describes procedures for after a class, such as resuming your
    class material into a wiki (if nobody has made a wiki on your subject beforehand)
    and linking to it.
    

==== 1.3.1 Creating and linking to the classes Wiki (encouraged, but optional) ====

    After you have taught a class, please write up a wiki page, resuming what you covered in your class. This is NOT supposed to be a pasting of the logs. If there is already a wiki page written, and you consider it to be complete, it will also be accepted.
    Go to ClassroomTranscripts and add a link to your classes' wiki, or to the existing wiki, following the format shown on the transcript page.
    You may skip this step, but please inform someone on the Classroom team that you are unable to take the time to do this so we are able to put something up instead.
