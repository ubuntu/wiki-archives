Agenda for the May 16, 2010 Ubuntu-CA IRC meeting - 23:00 UTC (19:00 EDT)

=== Introductions ===

Since we're just getting the group out of hibernation, it would be nice to know a bit about eachother.  What do you do with Ubuntu?  What are your interests and expertise?

=== What is a LoCo ===

Brief discussion about what a national LoCo is, what it isn't, what it does and how you can help.

=== Events ===

Let's brainstorm a bit about future events.

* external Free Software events we want Ubuntu-CA to have a presence at
* events we want to put on ourselves

=== The Website ===

What do we want to do with it?  How long til Canonical moves to Wordpress?

* Stay Canonical hosted or redirect to our own server.
* Fixing the theme.
* Getting more content/contributors?
* Ubuntu Canada Planet: Syndicating blogs from chapters/users.

==== Brett Alton's Design ====
Just a quick, incomplete mock-up that can start some discussion about where we'd like to go with our website, design and content placement.
