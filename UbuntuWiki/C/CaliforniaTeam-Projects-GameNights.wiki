== Game Nights ==

Game nights for the Ubuntu California team would be a virtual event for team members to play multiplayer games on Ubuntu over the Internet.

=== Game Suggestions ===

There are a few game directions we can go such as graphics intensive games like Open Arena or more simple games like poker and chess. Here is a list of multiplayer games collected so far with some notes. Please add any comments you might have related to each game that can help narrow down the selections. Some games that are single player like chess and backgammon could be played collectively if we had a tournament setup.

==== PokerTH ====
* open source
* all graphics cards
* connect via lan or internet

==== PyChess ====
* open source

* download from software center
* single player, maybe set up a tournament page

==== KBackgammon ====

Game play is fun if you like backgammon. It is one vs. one so would need to create a tournament for game play. The only way I could register for free FIBS (first internet backgammon server) account to play online was to download and run the javafibs file here: http://www.fibs.com/javafibs/download

* open source
* most graphics cards
* supposed to have multiplayer

==== PyScrabble ====
Tested on March 1st 2012. Game play was a lot of fun with 4 players. Not entirely sure how many can play in each game, but could easily split up people into games of 4 each.
