This team manages and updates global and local news at the website Ubuntu Chile (http://www.ubuntu-cl.org), adding outstanding information from Ubuntu members in Chile and all over the world news.

Our Website Team is made up of local editors in charge of posting and checking articles for our web pages, those posts can be sent by other members or contributors, collected by the Chief editor or directly produced and posted by himself.

At present the Website Team is reviewing the organizational structure and process of work, projecting a dynamic upgrading to this website, considering graphics and interactive work design.

The size of the group is ~1500 members and the main focus of the group is to help newcomers with Ubuntu. We also use it for making announcements to the local community.

The Marketing Team deals with the sponsoring motto and spreading out of Ubuntu brand and trademark in Chile, this staff runs a mobile stand and takes it to different events along our country when possible, this group intends to give out Ubuntu written and oral information to interested visitors and public in general, as members of this team we are also in charge of producing our own materials (brochures, speeches, and sponsoring materials). In addition we update our wiki page constantly.
We always introduce new visitors to Ubuntu's most highlighted features as Linux OS, we also give out official CDs and DVDs of the latest updated Ubuntu versions, brochures and stickers, and inform newbies about some important deeds lately done by our Ubuntu Concil representative, AlvaroBarahona., from Chilean National Government's position charge.
