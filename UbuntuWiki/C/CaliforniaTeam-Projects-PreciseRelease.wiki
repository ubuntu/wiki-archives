If you would like CDs, please contact Elizabeth Krumbach at lyz@ubuntu.com with your name, address and purpose for request (Need some for your school or library? Handing out at small event?)

This is ''the only shipment'' the team gets per cycle, so please don't waste these CDs and request only a limited number to suit your needs! Follow these tips to help stretch our supply:

* At tech events, inform users that they can download and burn an ISO: <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BurningIsoHowto|BurningIsoHowto]]</nowiki>
* Burn ISOs as they wait! Bring along a system that can burn a CDR at the event and give them a fresh copy
* Use the pressed CDs as display copies and use our <nowiki>[[CaliforniaTeam-Projects-CDSleeves|CDSleeves]]</nowiki> for burned copies
* For installs and demos at an event, try using a USB stick

NOTE: For large conferences please contact Elizabeth Krumbach at lyz@ubuntu.com to request an UbuntuAtConferences conference pack plus CDs ''at LEAST 6 weeks prior to the event''
