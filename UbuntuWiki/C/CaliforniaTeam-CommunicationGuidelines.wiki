<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/warning.png]]</nowiki> This page is a draft <nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/warning.png]]</nowiki> Here is <nowiki>[[CaliforniaTeam-Guidelines|one alternative]]</nowiki>.
----
A process is being established to develop some basic rules for how team communications channels will be used. This document distills what has been agreed to so that our group of California <nowiki>[[LoCoTeams|Ubuntu fans and enthusiasts]]</nowiki> can move forward together working to help advocate, promote, translate, develop and otherwise improve Ubuntu and Free Software.

* Forward Emails With Relevance Included - on other mailing lists (such as <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/loco-contacts|loco-contacts]]</nowiki>) there may be announcements and content relevant to our team. While we value forwarding these emails to the <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-us-ca|ubuntu-us-ca]]</nowiki> mailing list, please check first to see if the mail has already been sent, if it applies to team projects and add a few notes about how it could apply to the team. This will ensure the forwarded email is as valuable as possible.
* Mark Sensitive Wiki Edits As Such - our wiki pages are open to edits by everyone, and we actively encourage an environment in which everyone can edit each others content to improve it. If there is content that should be cautiously changed (such as governance and rules), please mark them as so.
