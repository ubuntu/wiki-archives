=== Background ===
This session is a "General Discussion" with no specific agenda, just sharing Ubuntu stuff that's going on in Vancouver, some marketing results from our first blitz and perhaps a brainstorm about Ubuntu Vancouver upcoming events. We have a General Meeting, a party, a bug squish, support sessions, theme nights, more marketing blitz's, and lots of other good stuff in our future, so it's perhaps a great time to get all the minds in one place and start thinking about planning.
