=== Ubuntu History ===

My main goal is to promote Ubuntu in several ways: I spread the word around me, I try to be present to some computer fairs. 
These contributions are rather low because I am spending quite some time on the <nowiki>[[http://fosdem.org|FOSDEM]]</nowiki> organization. 

=== Ubuntu Contributions ===

- '''2005''' Start using Ubuntu.

- '''2004-2006''' Promotion of Open Source Software and Linux at my university. Gave during 1,5 years courses about using linux. First basic but also more advanced.

- '''2007''' Particitpated to the Ubuntu stand on a few <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BelgianTeam/ComputerFairs|Dipro Computer Fairs]]</nowiki>. 

- '''2008-01''' Participation to the Ubuntu-be Kickoff-meeting
