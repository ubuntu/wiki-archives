== ATI 9.11 driver & Ubuntu 9.10 ==

INTRODUCTION

Ubuntu does not install 3d graphics drivers by default. Such needs to be installed by the user. As I use an ATI GPU at this time, I will focus on that, but the Ubuntu commands are very similar, if not identical for a Nvidia GPU.

At the time of writing, the ATI 9.11 3d driver does not work with Ubuntu 9.10. I do not know what the bug(s) are.

As such I will defer adding to this guide until the bug(s) are resolved.

Thank you.
