== About me ==
I have been using Linux in one way or another for many years now. At work I have a big saying in which systems to use, and all backend services are now running debian or ubuntu.

I push for implementing Ubuntu on certain categories of desktops, it is not an easy job.

== Points of interest as an ubuntu member ==
Bugreporting, translation
