I am applying because:

''Remove any reasons that don't apply, add any extra reasons and edit as
needed. These examples are the common cases, but are not a hard requirement for applications.''

* I'd like to reduce the burden on my sponsors.
* I'd like to assist in the packaging process for packages I work on

== Who I am ==
''I am a graduate software defined networking developer, I have been programming since a very young age and have had a strong interest in linux and open source for the majority of my life. I contribute to microovn and ovn and greatly enjoy doing so.''

=== Examples of my work / Things I'm proud of ===
* Microovn service control
* Assisted with OVN unnumbered BGP work

=== Future Goals ===
* To become more proficient in both software defined networking and package maintainership
