Welcome to the page for Ubuntu California's presence at the <nowiki>[[https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/14x | 14th Southern California Linux Expo]]</nowiki>!  The expo runs from January 21-24, 2015 (Thurs-Sun), but the exhibition floor will be open Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.

SCALE 6X in 2008 was Ubuntu California's second public event and the Lo``Co has maintained the Ubuntu booth ever since.  This year the Ubuntu booth will showcase Ubuntu and its derivatives, exciting new projects like Snappy Ubuntu Core, and Ubuntu running on phones.  We will also host select Ubucon speakers for visitor meet-and-greets and additional discussion.  We are working closely with Canonical's Community Team to help coordinate equipment sponsorship.

Ubuntu California team members who are not volunteering at the booth can use a coupon code ''UBNTU'' for half off your Full Access pass registration. <nowiki>[[CaliforniaTeam-Projects-Scale14x#Volunteers|Booth volunteers]]</nowiki> will receive a complimentary Exhibitor badge.

== Ubucon ==

Richard Gaskin and Nathan Haines are in charge of Ubucon.  Some Ubucon speakers may schedule times to be on hand at the Ubuntu booth to discuss their presentation topics with booth visitors throughout the weekend.

Ubucon Summit is an officially endorsed two-day event combining speakers from the Ubuntu community as well as a day of unconference talks for both the general Ubuntu community as well as Ubuntu developers.  Members of the Ubuntu Design Team, the Ubuntu Touch team, the Ubuntu Core Team, and the Canonical Community Team will meet at Ubucon Summit to discuss the progress and status of Ubuntu 16.04 LTS across all form factors.

The opening keynote speaker on January 21st at 10am will be <nowiki>[[MarkShuttleworth|Mark Shuttleworth]]</nowiki>.
