This guide will help you to change your shell from one to another. We have many Shells and this will help you how to change from one to another Shell by using a command named as 

<pre>

chsh

</pre>

__For example changing your SHELL from BASH to ZSH you have to follow this :

<pre>
raja@badfox:~$ chsh
Password: 
Changing the login shell for raja
Enter the new value, or press ENTER for the default
	Login Shell [/bin/bash]: 

raja@badfox:~$ chsh
Password: 
Changing the login shell for raja
Enter the new value, or press ENTER for the default
	Login Shell [/bin/bash]: /bin/zsh

raja@badfox:~$ 
</pre> 

 Now logout to apply the changes and check your shell with 

<pre>

echo $SHELL

</pre>

Hope that helps.
