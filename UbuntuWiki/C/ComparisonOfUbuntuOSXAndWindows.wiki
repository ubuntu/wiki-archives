=== Idea of this page ===
Comparing the most marketed features of the latest operating systems from the major Operating system vendors: Microsoft, Apple and (for the sake of comparison) Canonical/Ubuntu Community (which leaves us with Vista, OS X Tiger and Intrepid Ibex), could help get a rational overview of where the Desktop market is at present day and help make strategical decisions for those who are aiming to increase the share of Linux-based desktop computers through marketing efforts. 

=== Scope ===
All comparisons should be made from a new clean installation perspective point of view! For OS X and Vista - this is either accomplished in the terms of an upgrade from XP or an earlier cat - or - a new computer-purchase. For Intrepid a clean installation using a downloaded and burnt ISO installation disc with default values are presumed. 

For features that are basically the same in all systems - or simply is good enough to meet most targeted user's requirements in all systems - are listed in the bottom of this page and do not belong in the comparison tables. 

Zealotry does not belong on this page, as does not irony or facts based on biased personal opinion. Keep it real and based upon the opinions of the majority of Desktop and Office user's, cited as needed.
