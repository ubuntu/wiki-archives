__TOC__

As of 2015-05, the old "pepperflashplugin-nonfree" is deprecated in favor of an official, maintained, one-step package called '''adobe-flashplugin''', which works for Firefox and Chromium and derivatives, but not for Yandex.Browser 46.0.2490.3623 beta (64-bit version) on November 2015. No terminals, no multiverse. 

Add the Canonical Partners software source, and install ''adobe-flashplugin''.  See <nowiki>[[Chromium-Getting-Partner-Flash]]</nowiki>.
