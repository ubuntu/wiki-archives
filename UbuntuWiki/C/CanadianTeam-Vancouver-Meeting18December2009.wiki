=== Some Background Information ===
'''Ubuntu is all about community'''. Our meetings are designed to be friendly, welcoming, and non-intimidating for '''all'''. No computer experience is assumed or required. We meet to share ideas about freedom in computing through the use of Ubuntu and also to build relationships in our community that transcend the stereotypical "user group" or "computer club".

In this spirit, please consider bringing a guest or two to this meeting, ideally someone who normally wouldn't attend a "computer club" type of event (a friend, significant other, family member.) We promise to make it interesting for everyone who attends! And don't forget to add them to your RSVP if they're not already a meetup member.

'''Our Theme for the evening is "Celebrating Ubuntu's Karmic Community". Here is our agenda (so far):'''

=== Agenda (Proposed) ===

==== Presentation: "Stuff That's Generally Interesting" ====

'''Plans sometimes change''', so please '''RSVP above''' to ensure that you are updated in the event we need to move to bigger space, or for any other important news about this meeting.
=== Important Notes ===
==== a. Treats ====
Members usually bring '''treats''' to share with everyone, potluck style. It's not required, but we certainly welcome it, as it helps create a more friendly environment for socializing, especially given that many people come to our meetings directly from work. And, if you're not comfortable preparing or sharing drinks/food for others, please consider picking something up from your nearest supermarket, bakery, pub on the way over.  (Examples of what members have brought to previous meetings: sandwiches, sushi rolls, cupcakes, muffins, veggies, cookies, tangerines, nuts, coffee, tea, juice, pop, wine, ... the list is growing!)
==== b. Rescue Centre ====
In parallel with the latter half of the meeting we host a '''Rescue Centre.''' If you have an Ubuntu issue that you just can't seem to figure out, this will be the place for you! Expert(s) will be on hand to help triage issues and to provide suggestions. (Please remember to RSVP with a comment on the type of assistance that you will need. Also remember that this is time-limited so it's proabably not realistic to expect a complete reinstall or something very detailed.)
==== c. Chairs ====
We never seem to have enough. If you are driving, please consider throwing an extra folding chair (or two) in your trunk on the way over. We promise not to hurt them, and the meeting is more comfortable when everyone has a seat.
==== d. Still Want More? ====
After the meeting some members continue socializing nearby on "The Drive". For those who want to mingle with Ubuntu Vancouver LoCo folks, in a less formal (restaurant/patio) setting, please plan to join us after the meeting. (The venue will be announced as part of the meeting wrap-up.)
