The Ubuntu-cm LoCo is a group of open source enthusiasts guys who want to share their knowledge in their area. We want to make aware others that open source software are reliable enough for their daily life usage. When it will be possible, we will provide efficient tools for their local users.

We organised online meetings and attend to some events when possible.

In small groups spread around Cameroon we use to organise small gathering and talks on various topics about free software and Ubuntu.

The approval will give to the team a better visibility in the young cameroonian IT environment.
