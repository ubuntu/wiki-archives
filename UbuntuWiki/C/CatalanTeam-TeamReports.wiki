<nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BuildingCommunity/TeamReporting/HowTo| Reporting Team Howto]]</nowiki>

Welcome to the CatalanTeam reporting page. Every month this page should be filled with bullet points indicating the summary of some of the work you have been working on. As you work on something, try to summarise it here. A few guidelines for how to write good points here:

* Keep it simple and short - single sentences are best. :)
* Try to summarize your work and not be over-detailed - we don't need to know specifics, just a summary of the kind of work involved
* Where possible, include relevant links.
