The 8-bit / Karmic party is being billed as "Data Beez" and
performances run from 8-11.  We are designating 7-8 as the
Installfest, although of course everyone is free to keep installing
stuff all night.  How about some Linux LAN games?
There is going to be some small reasonable cover charge for admission
to the show, but anyone who comes to the Installfest with a laptop
before 8 gets in free.  If you don't have a laptop to bring but you
want to volunteer to help with the Installfest, we will also have an
RSVP list for volunteers to get in before 8.

Let's promote the hell out of this party to celebrate
Linux, check out some top-of-the-line 8-bit music, and bring in a few
people to help cover the expenses of bringing this great crew of
artists in from NYC and elsewhere.
