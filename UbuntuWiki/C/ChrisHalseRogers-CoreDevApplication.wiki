== Who I am ==
I'm Chris Halse Rogers, and I work for Canonical on the Desktop team mainly maintaining the X stack.  I'm also involved in the Debian & Ubuntu Mono teams, and upstream on GNOME Do and Docky.

== My Ubuntu story ==
I started using Ubuntu around the Breezy release, and started contributing in areas I was interested in soon after; first multimedia, then Mono and the nouveau drivers.

=== My involvement ===
=== Examples of my work / Things I'm proud of ===

I'm pretty proud of my work on <nowiki>[[http://do.davebsd.com|Do]]</nowiki>, particularly wandering around UDSs & sprints and watching people use it.  I'm pleased with how the graphics stack in Maverick ended up.

=== Areas of work ===
I've worked on UNE and F-Spot towards the end of the Lucid release, as the primary member of the Ubuntu-X team for the Maverick release, and now continue in Ubuntu-X.

=== Things I could do better ===
I keep my work on packages in the pkg-xorg git repositories on my system for too long; I need to push the incomplete changes publicly more frequently to aid collaboration.

== Plans for the future ==
=== General ===
* Keep X ticking over, and improve how we deal with unusual & broken hardware.
* Ensure X supports what the DX team needs, and fix it where we hit broken edges.
* Keep an eye on the nascent open-source GPU video decoding stack and make sure we've got all the interesting bits in Ubuntu.

=== What I like least in Ubuntu ===
Not specific to Ubuntu, but generally - the lack or backwardness of C# bindings for our platform.  Python is getting it much more right with Py-GI.  I think I can write a C# gobject-introspection binding generator, and am working on one.

==== General feedback ====
I've been working with RAOF for a few years now on maintaining X packages.  I really appreciate how patient he is with bug reporters, and how good he is at following up with them until their issue is solved.  He also keeps a good pulse on upstream developments, which helps him spot patches worth inclusion in Ubuntu.  I also respect how deeply he groks the X packaging complexities of mesa, libdrm, and other dark corners of X.org that few packagers fear to tread.

Beyond X, he's had his hands in a number of other areas of the distro, which gives me confidence that he can be trusted with core development privileges Ubuntu-wide.

==== Specific Experiences of working together ====
I worked most closely with RAOF during the Lucid development cycle, where we brought in the -nouveau driver with Kernel Mode Setting support.  This required extensive coordination between us and the kernel team, as well as coordination with Debian and upstream.  The packaging work was complex and error prone, with very high risks of severe breakage (e.g. boot failure and system lockups) if things were done incorrectly.  The fact that we were able to transition from -nv to -nouveau, enable KMS, and not leave a smoking crater where our userbase was, is testament to RAOF's attention to quality and caution in rolling out dangerous changes.

I've reviewed and sponsored many of RAOF's uploads and find his work is trustworthy and reliable.

The one situation I can think of that could have been handled better involved a bug that RAOF already had a solution for, but didn't get it uploaded before leaving on a long duration airplane flight.  While he was en route, the bug became high profile, but the solution hadn't been posted to git or the bug report, so we ended up duplicating efforts unnecessarily.  In the grand scheme of things it was pretty minor (the bug was solved), but better communication of status could have saved time.

==== Areas of Improvement ====
Like I mentioned above, given the X team's distribution in time and space, more verbose communication of current status on bugs would probably help save co-workers some time and help avoid duplication of effort.  But I think this is holds true of all of us X packager guys.

=== Martin Pitt ===
I uploaded a magnitude of 10 X.org related packages for Chris, none of which I
had anything to complain about. I also sponsored some GNOME related updates
from him.

Chris has shown attention and dedication to details, and I'm confident in his
packaging skills. I welcome him to become a core developer.

=== Steve Kowalik ===
I have uploaded what seems to be a large number of packages for Chris, and I continue to be impressed with his dedication and attention to detail. I'm confident in his abilities, and would welcome him as a core developer.

=== Timo Aaltonen ===
I've done a bunch of sponsoring for Chris, including full rebuilds of the whole X stack. There hasn't been anything to complain about, so a core-dev status for him would be most welcome.

=== Chase Douglas ===
Chris has been a great help to our multitouch efforts. We regularly touch the X stack, and he has been instrumental in helping us review and integrate changes. I have found him to be a great resource both in debian packaging and in upstream development. Further, he shares a great enthusiasm for Ubuntu, and I believe he can be counted on to act responsibly to further the project as a whole. And anyone who willingly test builds the entire of X locally is probably ready for the technical challenges of core dev. As such, I endorse Chris for core dev membership without reservation.
