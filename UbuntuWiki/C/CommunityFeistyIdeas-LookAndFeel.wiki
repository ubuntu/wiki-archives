Mark Shuttleworth recently blogged about making Ubuntu prettier. It is probably a good idea. So lets talk about how we would like Feisty Fawn to be more pretty and polished. (Note: You can read his blog entry about this here: http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/63)

* Does this include music? I like the Edgy login music -- short and sweet.

* Lots of people complain about the brown theme. Could we have a first-time-login wizard that allows people to mess around with their theme? Make it easy to dismiss, though. 

* Just found a link to an orange theme. Some of the screenshots look quite polished: http://www.taimila.com/orange-look.php

* This isn't necessarily the place for talking about compiz, etc, but how do we want to integrate those into our basic look and feel? Meaning, how to do we integrate transparency, etc, without becoming too bloated or having to have two themes, one for high-end and one for low-end machines?
** Transparency hinders readability. An example of a composite effect that should increase usability instead is shadow.

* Use custom panel backgrounds to make it look spiffier
 
* Bundle system-themes into consistent deb packages including everything needed to change the look and feel of grub + usplash + gdm + wallpaper. 

** Maybe few Themes for each release, default theme in installation source + additonal temes availables in repositories. So should be easy to user change whole look keeping coherence.

* Do the same for user-themes, possibly using equivalent package names for associated themes. 

* Make a single interface to install a system theme that covers all aspects required. The GUI should be similar to the user-them manager so that you can easily select a single consistent theme, but you can also customize it. 

*** I like the idea of being able to customize the mouse theme, login, splash screen, Window borders, icons, and Application themes all in one easy to use interface or Theme Center.

* Make the themes available in G-A-I. And rename G-A-I from "Add Remove" into "Add-ons" (more intriguing and more in line with FF).

* Make the panel work like Firefox toolbar. Firefox toolbar has a nice interface as far as the toolbar goes. There is only one item in the menu: "customize", after that it is all drag and drop and things go easily in the right position. Compare this with the gnome panel where shortcut menu is cluttered with customization items (add, remove, move, lock...), an akward locking mechanism, things move "continuously" and you can end up with blank spaces between items. 
** Enlightenment 0.17 has a similar technique, where a menu entry (something like "Edit Mode") gives everything resize handles and makes them draggable when clicked on, regardless of their usual clickableness (is that a word?). Also, Kicker has the option to not show handles unless the mouse is over the widget/applet, which seems to be a more intuitive way of handling (excuse the pun) applets, as GNOME's handles often go unnoticed since they hang around all of the time. Also, if handles are going to be used at all then any "lock" or "cutomise" mode is made pretty much irrelevant, since the handles become mostly useless when "lock" is on or "customise" isn't (if this idea will simplify applet's right-click menus then a single menu can be used across the whole applet [I am thinking of the window list here] rather than the applet's controls only being accessible from the handle), so either use a "customise" mode, or keep the handles as an always-on customise mode (I think the "lock to panel" toggle should be done away with anyway, unless it is sorted out to actually do what it says. Try locking a load of application launchers to a non-expanded panel and log out and in a few times, you'll see they keep getting rearranged when they are supposed to be locked in place, and reorganising them to their correct locations is made more difficult by having to unlock all of the launchers first!))

* OS X and Windows Vista both have shiny, smooth looking icons and themes. Give the menus , backgrounds, and title-bars the same glossy look.
** Will KDE's Oxygen (I think it's called) be usable in GNOME? Those icons look pretty cool (although I am a very matte person myself and think that Clearlooks 2 perverted the perfection which is Clearlooks 1 :) )

* Can we finally get theme recoloring in GTK? I hate it that I need to install a complete new theme if all I want to change is the color/shape/size of one component.
** We ''have'' theme recolouring in GTK, someone just needs to bite the bullet and integrate it into something useful, like a GUI tool or maybe even GTK itself... [CarlVanTonder].
** This already exist here <nowiki>[[http://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php?content=47349]]</nowiki> and there is an ubuntu package here <nowiki>[[http://asher256-repository.tuxfamily.org/index.php?page=packages&subpage=3&lang=fr]]</nowiki>. This would be very nice if it was in a new tab in "Themes" and would be even more better if it loaded the corors from the current theme.

* Add an option to change the splashscreen (and the background color) in gnome themes window.

* Integrate customization of the upslash,so that you can just have the usplash package compile your .PNG or .SVG to be used

* Make it easier to change the GTK theme used in GDM. I still can't work out how to do this.

* Make an intelligent handler for .tar.gz files - metacity, gtk, icon and GDM themes aswell as standard compressed archives could be differentiated and handled appropriately.

* A really nice gnome theme mock-up. It saves screen real estate. http://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php?content=31128
** This mock-up is just the best Desktop design I`ve ever seen. GNU/Linux with this Gnome theme would look far more better than any OS. It would be really a good reason for people to migrate to such a clean and neat Desktop --LucasArruda
** Absolutely amazing mock-up. It would revolutionize the Desktop UI in a way Vista only dreams of. :) However, it does look like some pretty significant changes would need to be done. Fiesty+1 or +2 possibly?
** Another nice one: http://desplesdadotcom.nfshost.com/?p=75

* A glossy green/blue/black (alternate?) theme. Clean, shiny, smooth looking themes are a cool factor on computers, which makes switching to Ubuntu more appealing. (Just look at OSX with its use of blue, XP's use of green, and Vista's use of black.)
*** Maybe too Orange, like Dapper Drake, Brown, like Hoary, Silver/Grey, as oposite to Vista's Black, and maybe purple, like Kubuntu Edgy Eft. Available for color schemes, gtk themes, metacity/compiz/beryl/kwin & icons.

* Shape the ends of the panels, possibly raise menu buttons or raise them on mouseover (exposing the button boundary, clarifying that the words _are_ buttons).

* Have a look at this exciting previews: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuEvolve

* It´s a small and easy thing. Close button sometimes have a red colored X image. Sometimes when I finish installing something with Sinaptyc and I see this I feel something wrong happen.

* Here's my idea about what the buttons should look like: {{http://img207.imageshack.us/img207/9513/buttonstyle2rs4.png}}
