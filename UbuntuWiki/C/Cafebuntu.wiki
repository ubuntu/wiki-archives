=== Summary ===

Cybercafés need lots of machines that user can use, which don't get hacked and can be centrally managed, rebooted, powered-on and powered-off.

=== Rationale ===

Get Ubuntu into cybercafés with a great out of the box-experience and people will love it and tell their cybercafé-owning friends about how easy their lives have become.

=== Use cases ===

Bruce plans to set up an Internet café. He realises that he will have to spend an important amount of money on Windows licenses and billing software. He learns from a friend that he can get everything working easily and for zero price if he chooses to use Ubuntu.

Clark usually goes to an Internet café to check his e-mails and browse the web. He has gotten used to the programs they use there for IM, Internet browsing... when he finally buys his own computer, he learns that he can download and install legally and for zero price all the software he's been using in the café. He also tells his friends.

=== Scope ===

* '''Client-side''': Kioskmode, with Browser, Instant messaging client and anything else the owner is going to allow.
* '''Client-changes''': Dialogue box showing available time, allowing top-up of credit, ordering of Muffins-with-chocolate-on-top and logging off.

=== Design ===

=== Implementation ===

* The network code all already exists in Edubuntu, Ogra will add an install target that runs the clients in Kioskmode in Dapper+1 and we can build on that.
* Pessulus and sabayon for creating and locking down profiles.

==== Data preservation and migration ====

* Clients netboot and run out of RAM.  Nothing is there for them to mess up.
