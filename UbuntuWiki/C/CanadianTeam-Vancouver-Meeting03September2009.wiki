This event was designed to provide a practical showcase for Ubuntu in a non-intimidating and supportive setting. It was designed to provide a little bit of coaching and support to those who needed it.  '''Thank you to everyone that came out and made this a success.'''

Short Summary of Meeting:

<<AttachList>>
* Several people brought systems that had various anomalies
* We could have used more time to fix more issues, but overall we accomplished a lot

== Ubuntu Beginner Night (The Original Promo) ==

* Are you new to Ubuntu?
* Do you know someone who is?
* Are they skeptical?
* Do you know someone who just never seems ready to try it?
* Are they saving their money for "Windows 7" or "Mac Snow Leopard"? Yikes!

Members of the community are free to drop-in and talk to people who live and breathe Ubuntu everyday. Ubuntu Vancouver folks will be there to demonstrate 1-on-1 the many ways that Ubuntu is amazing!

Please RSVP here, and please bring the skeptical. http://www.meetup.com/ubuntuvancouver/calendar/11239242/
(And, if you live and breathe Ubuntu, please come and help.)
