We will be celebrating the <nowiki>[[NattyReleaseSchedule|release of Ubuntu 11.04 (Natty Narwhal)]]</nowiki> scheduled for release April, 2011. (see below)  Natty is *not* a Long Term Support (<nowiki>[[LTS]]</nowiki>) release but continues to set the stage for the next (12.04) LTS.  Physical and virtual (IRC & other) Natty events will be scheduled.  Each release cycle a number of efforts happen focused around the release.  Globally, <nowiki>[[UbuntuDeveloperWeek]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[UbuntuGlobalJam]]</nowiki> events happen a month or two before the release focusing on new contributors.  Parties (listed below) and <nowiki>[[UbuntuOpenWeek]]</nowiki> happen near or after the release.  If you are thinking about organizing one, <nowiki>[[BuildingCommunity-RunningReleaseParty]]</nowiki> has some hints more hints are described in a video <nowiki>[[http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/6181333|how to do a release party.]]</nowiki> "... can be organized in literally 10 minutes."
