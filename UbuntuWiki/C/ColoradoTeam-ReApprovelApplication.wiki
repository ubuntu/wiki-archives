=== Challenges ===

* Lack of timely responsiveness & support from the higher ups in the Ubuntu Community.
** Had difficulties in getting support for running booths at events.
* Large geographical region. Hard to plan events that involve as many people as possible.
* Financing for events. 
** Not a lot of locations that can play host to a group our size. While still providing WiFi, Beer, Food, and Family Env, and be free.
