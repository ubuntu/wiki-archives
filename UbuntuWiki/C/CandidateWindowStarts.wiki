__TOC__

From this point in time, any image produced could be the one we release as the final image.

All images in this interval should have 100% mandatory test case coverage as specified on the ISO tracker, or issues agreed as OK to release note by the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-release/+members#active|Release Team]]</nowiki>.
