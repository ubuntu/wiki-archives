Welcome to the California Team reporting page. Every month this page should be filled with bullet points indicating the summary of some of the work you have been working on. As you work on something, try to summarise it here. A few guidelines for how to write good points here:

* Keep it simple and short - single sentences are best. :)
* Try to summarize your work and not be over-detailed - we don't need to know specifics, just a summary of the kind of work involved
* Where possible, include relevant links.

More information is available on Ubuntu's TeamReports page and <nowiki>[[BuildingCommunity-TeamReporting-HowTo|HowTo]]</nowiki>.

The deadline for Team Report edits for a particular month is the first Sunday of the next month. Please do not edit month reports after that deadline, or add events to team reports before they actually take place.

If you have a team report entry to make for the month ''currently being worked on'' (the current month is listed at <nowiki>[[TeamReports]]</nowiki> under "Next Report In Progress"), and someone else hasn't already created the !LoCo's page for that month, you can add it with these steps:

# Log in to the wiki
# Visit https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CaliforniaTeam/TeamReports/TWODIGITYEARHERE/MONTHNAMEHERE (e.g. .../09/October)
# Click "Create new empty page"
# Add your entry in the box that comes up, add an edit comment, and click "Save Changes"
# Visit <nowiki>[[CaliforniaTeam-TeamReports-Current]]</nowiki> and edit it to point to the new month.

=== Editing an existing month ===

If you have a team report entry to make for the month ''currently being worked on'' (the current month is listed at <nowiki>[[TeamReports]]</nowiki> under "Next Report In Progress"), and the LoCo's page for that month is already created and listed below, you can add your entry with these steps:

# Log in to the wiki
