This page is kept as a historical reference to the team shirts that were created/sold in 2007 and 2008.  This new <nowiki>[[../2014 Tshirts|page]]</nowiki> is used to document the most recent shirt.

This page coordinates information and designs for team T-shirt orders.

Parameters for the shirt:
* Classy durable "Polo shirt" with embroidered logo and "Colorado Ubuntu Linux Team" on the left chest.  "CoLoCo Rocks" phrase on the left sleeve also (specify if you don't want it).

Style and Colors: see the default style, and choice of colors, on the Queensboro web page at http://www.queensboro.com/1433.html

Future orders: anyone can organize an order. You just need to order at least 4 shirts. The company we used for the first order was  http://www.queensboro.com

Future design possibilities, e.g. for a more casual t-shirt:
* Bonus points for stuff on the back also.
* Silkscreening or the like.  No decals.

Phrases:
 A. Linux for Human Beings

** back: Colorado LOCO: Community Supported Computer Fun

(...and for anyone who wants the Ubuntu font:  sudo apt-get install ttf-ubuntu-title)

=== First Order, 2007-09-12 ===
Cost for first order:
* The default shirt is $14.95
* The sleeve text is an additional $5
* Shipping for the entire order will be $12.50

I have a total of 18 shirts being order according to the wiki page. If you want
one and are not on the wiki you'd better get there before Monday. If you don't
specify size or color you get XL black. I hope the 1433 shirt is fine for
everyone (one person chose 1430). I know nothing about the quality of the shirt
and can't be responsible if it's not what you expect. Feel free to choose a
different style if you want and adjust your cost accordingly. I will submit the
order on Monday (assuming most people pay) so make sure the wiki is right for
what you want.

=== Commitments to Order ===

Fill in the form below to commit to a shirt of some sort. Without about 20 or so committing to buy them it will not make much sense to put in an order. We might also consider ordering 20 or so and then reselling them at meetings for the people that don't follow the mail list so much. I (Jim) will volunteer to collect the money and order the shirts (if everyone trusts me :)). I will not ask for any money until we are ready to put in the order. However, please indicate how you will pay so I know what to expect. You can send a check or Pay Pal. Cash works too if you close enough to me to deliver it. However, Pay Pal would be best.
