* '''Current Projects''': an as-of-yet unnamed <nowiki>[[http://www.supybot.com/|SupyBot]]</nowiki> plugin, adding a kind of infobot/chatterbot functionality.  Inspiration drawn from <nowiki>[[http://www.bmotion.net/|bMotion]]</nowiki>,  a chatterbot for plugin for <nowiki>[[http://www.eggheads.org/|eggdrop]]</nowiki>.  Writing bMotion was an excersize to help the main developer learn tcl, the idea behind my so-far-unnamed bot is to help me get a good grasp on Python.
