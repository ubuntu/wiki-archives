Nice to meet you Council

The Ubuntu Catalan LoCo Team is a very active, fast growing group of people that gathers the Catalan-speaking users community of Ubuntu in all its varieties. The scope of the Catalan LoCo Team is mainly the <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_countries|Catalan Countries]]</nowiki>, that is, the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CatalanTeam/Grafisme?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=mini_FonsUbuntuPPCC.png|territories where Catalan is traditionally spoken]]</nowiki>, where members and volunteers are scattered practically all over their geography. Its aim is to support and promote Ubuntu amongst the Catalan speaking community as it is the most important resource of information about Ubuntu in this language. We are a very heterogeneus and varied group of people focused on spreading the free software philosophy, specially Ubuntu, and have several projects in mind that will be carried out by our different workgroups in the near future.
