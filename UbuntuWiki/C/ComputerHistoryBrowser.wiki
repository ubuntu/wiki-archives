__TOC__

As explained here, it would be nice is we could have one interface to viewing the history of what you did on your computer. Below is a mockup:

There's been some research related to this. See at least <nowiki>[[http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/freeman/lifestreams.html|Lifestreams]]</nowiki> (and <nowiki>[[http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=84331|Beyond Lifestreams]]</nowiki>) and <nowiki>[[http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/rekimoto99timescape.html|TimeScape]]</nowiki>.

It would be relatively easy to implement a simple prototype of something like this on GNOME at least for documents. You could just watch the recent files list for changes and record the times in a db and create a display based on that. A fancier approach would be to patch gnome-vfs, but that's more invasive.

Of course, the applications and people part would require a bit more work.

You'd have to be careful not to re-implement that most /hated/ part of MSOutlook - the Journal!!!

It doesn't look any different to Outlook journal at all, except the concept has history of applications used.

Maybe something for beagle?

<nowiki>[[http://www.gnome.org/~seth/storage/features.html|Storage]]</nowiki> had something like this, too bad it's development got stalled.

Looks a bit like <nowiki>[[http://www.ethomaz.com/onlife/|Onlife]]</nowiki> for OS X.
