Here is a letter I am considering sending to one of the local newspapers in Salt Lake City (DeseretNews.com). It's a bit long and in need of editing so any input is appreciated.

Dear Editor,

The two major computer operating system producers, Microsoft and Apple, have released new versions of their systems in the past couple of months. Apple released Mac OS X 10.6 "Snow Leopard" in August, and Microsoft released its Windows 7 operating system just last week. Both operating systems have been anticipated for years and were released with much pomp and media fanfare.

In relative quietude compared to the releases of Mac and Windows, yesterday, October 29th, 2009, the small British company Canonical released Ubuntu version 9.10 "Karmic Koala", a Linux-based operating system for PCs (and Macs) of all descriptions: desktops, laptops, netbooks, and servers. Ubuntu is free; it costs nothing to download and try for yourself. Ubuntu is also free from viruses and license restrictions.

Linux is a widely used operating system powering computers ranging from most Top 500 supercomputers to many cell phones. Ubuntu is a collection of software including Linux and other Open Source software to create a user friendly operating system to rival the two big boys. Giving Ubuntu a try is easy: simply download and burn the CD-ROM, put it in your computers CD drive, and reboot. A fully-functional version will run from the CD which you can use to test its compatibility with your existing computer hardware, and install onto your computer's hard drive if you so choose.

To download Ubuntu and find more information, you can go to http://www.Ubuntu.com. There are also local support groups for Linux and Ubuntu in Ogden (http://oalug.com), Salt Lake (http://sllug.org, http://utah.ubuntu-us.org), and Provo (http://plug.org). Anyone who is looking to try an alternative in computing should give Ubuntu a try.
