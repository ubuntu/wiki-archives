== Creating Your Wiki Profile (Home Page) ==

=== Why you should create a profile ===
 As you start volunteering more in the Ubuntu Community, it is helpful to have a wiki profile. Your profile is a place that will let the community know more about you and your accomplishments. 
 
=== What you should include in your profile ===
 '''A basic profile should include:'''
* Your Real Name (at least, first initial and last name)
* Your Internet Contact Info:
** Email Address
** Freenode IRC nickname
** Launchpad name 
* A Brief related bio
  ''How do you fit into the community?'' 
* A List of Accomplishments.
  ''What have you done for the community?''
** Include links to your teams, projects and specs.
** Include description of your involvement.
* Your goals and vision for Ubuntu Linux
  ''When you ask for membership from the Community this important.''

=== About Me ===
 I discovered Linux and Ubuntu a few months ago. It was great. I got involved in the community when I had a problem with an application. I chatted on IRC about the problem and got interested in helping improve the application.

=== My Involvement ===
 I am involved with BugSquad and MOTU now. I am helping package an app I discovered just recently. I am also helping squash bugs in few gnome apps that appear on Launchpads bug list.

=== My Vision ===
 I plan to continue helping maintain the package. I want to become an official MOTU and someday maybe a Dev. I plan to continue helping the BugSquad squash those bugs that seem to never end.
