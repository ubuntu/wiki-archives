My only mission is to let Ubuntu and Kubuntu become a distro for desktop daily uses and not only for geeks and console amateurs.
A lot is done, but a lot is still to be done and I fight for this.

Some mine contributions:
* lot of comments and helping in closing bugs as duplicates in launchpad, just search for me and you will see my contributions
