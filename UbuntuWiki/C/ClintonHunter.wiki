== Introduction ==
----

Hello, my name is Clint and I live in Brisbane, Australia.

My first interest in Linux first started with PCLinuxOS 2007, through reading the APC Magazine.  You might recall that for a very brief time, PCLinuxOS was more popular than Ubuntu on distro watch.

My first introduction to a personal computer was probably back in 1989, a school friend had some sort of variety of 8-bit Amstrad PC.  I recall it took a few minutes to games from 5.25" floppy drives.  We finally got a PC at home in my early teenage years - 486 DX2, 66 MHz processor, 8 MB RAM, 300 MB HDD running IBM Dos with IBM Dosshell and then eventually Windows 3.11.

=== Education ===

My computer knowledge steadily grew through my own tinkering and in the computer lab in high school, where I also learnt basic programming in Pascal and GUI programming in Delphi Pascal v3, the pinnacle of my high school programming being a Mandlebrot/Julia Set generator. I also took IPT as a Board Subject for Year 11 and 12.  

After high school, I decided to study IT rather than music after much discussion and research and did a Diploma of IT - Network Engineering.  During the Diploma I did in 2000 was also the year I got my first taste of Linux - Red Hat.  It formed only a very small part of the course and was mainly covering the basics using the cli, and trying to get the GUI working.  At the time I wasn't really all that impressed by it and didn't give it much thought.

=== Work ===

After finishing the Diploma I ended up getting a job at a law firm...as a Photocopy Clerk (trust SRJA to get one of their graduates a job not even in their studied field!).  It all worked out in the wash though, as I managed to transfer to the IT department as an IT Support Analyst (Helpdesk) when an opening arose and have been there ever since (> 10 years now)

== IT Skill-set ==
----

I think of myself as an all-rounder - I have a wide breadth of knowledge and skills but none of them I have followed through to an high level of expertise.  Although I work in the IT, the majority of my work and knowledge gained at work is based around the proprietary systems required by the law firm.  However, I got involved in the Socialclub for awhile, which led to quite a few "outside of the square" IT projects that got me interested in various other areas that are outlined below.

=== Programming ===

* Python
** Years Used:  approx. 4
** Experience:  Mostly writing small cli scripts, I have started building GUIs in wxPython using Glade - most notable a program that acts as a GUI front for Windows Remote Access at work.

* Java
** Years Used: less than 1
** Experience:  I decided to start learning it when I discovered it was the language using for Droid applications.  Due to lack of time, and suprisingly, patience.  I have put it on the back-burner.  Compared to Python I find the syntax a little cumbersome.
