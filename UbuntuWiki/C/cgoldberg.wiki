=== About Me ===

My name is Corey Goldberg, and I am a software developer from Boston.  I've been working in software development and engineering since 1997.  I started using Ubuntu in it's first release (Warty Warthog!) back in 2004.  I currently work for Canonical, in Ubuntu Engineering, on the QA team.
