I live just east of Indianapolis, Indiana, USA. I have been an Ubuntu/Kubuntu since October 2005 (Breezy Badger), but before that I was a Debian user (3.1 Sarge, which was then "testing"). It was a while before I completely made the switch from Windows to Linux, though. It took me until Dapper Drake before I made Linux my primary OS, and by Edgy Eft, I was using Linux nearly exclusively at home. I used to prefer KDE over GNOME, but I have made the switch to GNOME.

Officially, my main contribution I have made to the open-source community is I am one of the few moderators for the "unofficial" OpenOffice.org User's Forum, located at <nowiki>[[http://oooforum.org]]</nowiki>. I took some programming classes in college over 10 years ago, but the only language we worked with was Pascal, which doesn't do me a whole lot of good now, and I have forgotten most of what I knew, anyway. But I do my best to spread open-source software to anyone who will listen to me.

I am also the secretary of the Board of Directors for the <nowiki>[[http://www.cinlug.org|Central Indiana Linux Users Group (CINLUG)]]</nowiki>.

I usually am found online under the username "corfy". This is true of the <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/member.php?u=130356|Ubuntu user forums]]</nowiki>, on irc.freenode.net, and in the Ubuntu IndianaTeam. But I am sometimes found under the username of jkcorfy (usually when a site requires six character username or corfy is already taken).
