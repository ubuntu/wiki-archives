Are you interested in helping to recruit instructors for the Ubuntu Classroom? Below we will explain what we look for when we are looking for instructors. Please also check out the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Classroom/Guidelines|guidelines]]</nowiki> to learn more information. 

When we look for instructors, first and foremost, we need to make sure that they are qualified to teach on a particular subject. The reason that we do this is to make sure we maintain a high level of quality in classes presented in the Ubuntu Classroom.

==== Potential instructor has never taught a class in the Ubuntu Classroom ====

When talking to someone about having them teach in the Ubuntu Classroom who has never taught in the Ubuntu Classroom before, please attempt to get the following information:
* any qualifications and experience that they have in the subject that they are wanting to teach
* A trusted member of the community who will verify that the potential instructor is qualified to teach the course that they are interested in

Once you find a potential instructor for the Ubuntu Classroom, and have gotten information on their qualifications and experience, you will need to find a time that they can teach their class. After determining a time for the class and a subject to be taught the instructor will need to go through the process listed on the the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Classroom/Submissions|submissions]]</nowiki> page and be approved by a member of the Classroom Management Team before they will be allowed to hold a class in the Ubuntu Classroom. Follow the instructions on the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Classroom/Guidelines|guidelines]]</nowiki> page for scheduling a class.

==== Potential instructor has taught in the Ubuntu Classroom in the past ====

If the potential instructor has taught in the Ubuntu Classroom then follow the instructions on the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Classroom/Guidelines|guidelines]]</nowiki> page for scheduling a class.
