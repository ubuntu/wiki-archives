Hello! I am a Computer Science student at UMass Lowell and Ubuntu enthusiast. This year I'm studying abroad at TU Darmstadt in Germany, and working as a researcher at the Center for Computer Graphics (ZGDV). Presently I am enthralled at the possibilities of GPGPU technology, which we are using to build a real-time multi-camera 3D reconstruction system. I am interested in making the most of life, and the question of how to do that is never fully resolved. Zen Buddhism and complex systems are the general frameworks of thinking that make the most sense to me, in terms of understanding the universe and informing my own philosophy, psychology, and actions. I enjoy taking pictures, playing jazz on my guitar, programming, traveling, and most of all talking with people.
