== Building Buzz around Bug Days ==

=== Intro ===

The QA team does a great job running hug days, we need to support them by building buzz around them so people who are interested in working on those bugs have a place to go and know what's going on. 

* <nowiki>[[UbuntuBugDay-|Main Hug Day Page]]</nowiki>

=== Talking Points ===

These are things you should consider mentioning in your blog/twitter post:

* The page for that specific hug day (<nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBugDay/20100318|Example]]</nowiki>).
* Link to the upstream project's page.
* Link to the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingProcedures|debugging procedures]]</nowiki>.
* Link to the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bugs/HowToTriage|How to Triage]]</nowiki> guide.
* Encourage people to <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BugSquad/AdoptPackage|Adopt the package]]</nowiki>.
* Encourage people to use <nowiki>[[http://launchpad.net/testdrive|testdrive]]</nowiki> to test bugs.

=== Other tips ===

* Bug work can be tedious, add some humor or something clever to make it more fun.
* Encourage bug work as part of the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuGlobalJam|Global Jam]]</nowiki> or other LoCo team events.
