=== About Me ===

  A bloke from Turkey in his early 20's. 

==== Socially ====

 I am interested in climbing, free and open source software and server administration. Currently I'm studying to get my LPI-1 certificate.

==== Professionally ====

  I am a Mining Engineer doing a PhD on Chemical Engineering at the moment. My main research area is fluidized bed flotation which is actually a way to separate valuable minerals from the gangue materials by using bubbles.

=== Ubuntu Participation ===

I am not sure just yet which groups but of course I will begin with 

==== Beginners Team ====

I am not a member of the Beginners Team yet. I am currently in the process of joining it. I wish to join this team because I want to contribute in as much as I can and learn more about Ubuntu. I aim to become a team member before April 2011.

==== Internet Relay Chat ====

My registered IRC nickname is cagriemer.  I am looking forward to getting to know the Ubuntu community members better through this medium.  I am planning to be present in the following channel(s):

1. #ubuntu
2. #ubuntu-beginners

=== Linux User Group (LUG) ===

=== Goals For The Future ===

1.  Become an Ubuntu Beginners Team member
2.  Learn to use Python effectively
3.  Help out people having problems with Ubuntu
