== Ubuntu Colombia 2017 - 2019 ==

=== Ubuntu Colombia Re-approval ===

Ubuntu Colombia is one of the most traditional LoCo Teams within the regional and global communities, specially with the Spanish language ones. As Ubuntu Colombia is conscious about the importance to keep being recognized as an active and official LoCo Team, we've created this Wiki page to summarize the main activities that we've done during the last three years. We know that the re-approval application should be done in 2016, but as many other communities we faced some problems during 2015 to 2016, now we are again active, and we want to continue spreading the FLOSS voice, the Ubuntu philosophy and the Ubuntu OS and related services.

==== Ubuntu Colombia Members ====

Ubuntu-Co has decreased the number of official members in Launchpad, however with the activities that we are doing, we have increased the members in our different channels and more than that, the people collaborating with the team that have made possible the update of this Wiki and has support the different activities that we report here. We had a process for the membership, that we plan to update after we accomplish the re-verification because it includes the creation of a Ubuntu Wiki that has been difficult. 

==== Council ====

Ubuntu Colombia is being administered by the council, composed by official community members.  Within its tasks, it should help fulfilling the community's interests in general, serve as support for different activities and events held all over the country, look for a harmony and orderly development in the community growth and help in establishing cooperation agreements between different LoCo Teams and communities within Colombia and other countries, within other several tasks.

As we mentioned before, we faced a crisis in 2015-2016 and the Council is not fully active, we plan to continue working at least one year more, in order to boost the community and after that call new elections.

The venue was divided into four parts:
a. Government and culture that consisted of conferences related to government policies and citizen culture in front of the technology (open data, citizen digital services etc.)
b. An area set for the realization of workshops dedicated to the practical part such as the installation of a LAPP server, implementation of firewalls in high availability etc <nowiki>[[https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bw2oPausZe17Mm9QVFFZN0NFVTQ/view|Photo]]</nowiki>.

On this occasion, we had the support of strategic allies who gave us their unconditional support, such as <nowiki>[[http://www.correlibre.org/co/|Fundación CorreLibre]]</nowiki>, who lent us their facilities to develop the course, we also supported great professionals certified in free technologies like Instructors.

The development of the course was divided into several sessions face-to-face, the topics covered were GNU / Linux Architecture and Hardware Identification, Boot System, etc. (the agenda is available <nowiki>[[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kZgntGslh3LdFXJ_zebIPsYflTJZ5jNgojRtwvq47KM/Edit|here]]</nowiki> ), the students followed the commands and instructions of the instructor in his own computer, virtual sessions were assigned to each student <nowiki>[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXiAUVYevEQ|see more]]</nowiki>. The students also practice with exams in which the topics were evaluated, the results of the exams were socialized to be able to see the failures and to be able to improve. The course finished with a test of 60 questions that simulated the certification, and could not miss the <nowiki>[[https://scontent.fbog4-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/19959278_10155533912454931_6675788275894606593_n.jpg?oh=f04e72d34124f4797151b55e15fe03f4&oe=59ED01FE|cake]]</nowiki> of Ubuntu Colombia
