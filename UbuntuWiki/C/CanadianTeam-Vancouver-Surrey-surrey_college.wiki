__TOC__

At CDI Surrey, we have a networking lab. In this lab, we have 28 computers. Each student is assigned one computer where they run multiple operating systems virtually.

Since the class has grown to capacity, it was decided to add an afternoon class which meant I had to find a way to allow multiple users to use one machine without potentially damaging another student's work.

The network here is based off of a MS Active Directory Hierarchy and each student has his/her own login and network drive. While a network drive prevents regular students from having their work wiped out during a Wipe/Image scenario, it doesn't help students who must run multiple operating systems at once.

Enter Ubuntu.

I set up a test machine with Ubuntu 9.10 64bit connected to the AD via Likewise and installed VirtualBox. I installed Windows XP in Virtualbox and logged off. I had a student log in using their AD credentials and open virtualbox. Empty. Perfect.

I added the student to the sudoers file so they could troubleshoot basic problems and download updates and voila!

We now have a working, multi-user set up where students can run their virtualbox without fear of damaging another student's work.
