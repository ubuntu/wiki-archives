__TOC__

The Columbus Local Community Team provides peer support and advocacy for Ubuntu Linux, and Free Software generally, to citizens of Columbus, Ohio.

We're not in direct competition with the <nowiki>[[http://www.colug.net/|Central Ohio Linux User Group]]</nowiki>, of which many of us are members.  Rather, we aim to create a support community for novice users who might otherwise be intimidated by the more technical discussions prevelant on the COLUG mailing list.

=== Activities ===
* Advocate Ubuntu
* Distribute Ubuntu CDs and DVDs
* answer questions on the mailing list (http://freegeekcolumbus.org/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu)

=== Members ===
* ScottMerrill
