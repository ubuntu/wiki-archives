== About Me ==
Hi, my name is Cedric. I like computers a lot and I've been using Linux since I discovered it the first time when i was 14 years old. These last few months I got rid of other operating systems completely and so now I am currently using Ubuntu as my main and only operating system. I like to develop software. Other hobbies of mine include making music, acting, reading and flying.
