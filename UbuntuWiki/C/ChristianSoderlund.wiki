=== About Me ===
I was born 1980 in Sweden. I work as a Linux system administrator for a big Swedish company. Linux means Red Hat Enterprise Linux in our case and I am also a Red Hat Certified Engineer. I recently (april 2007) installed Ubuntu for the first time (Feisty) and I was amazed about the simplicity of the installation. I recommend Ubuntu for home usage to all my friends :)
