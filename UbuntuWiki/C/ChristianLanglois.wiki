=== Personal Profile ===

I am a software developer with 30+ years experience. Have run small teams (development, test and operations) using a hands on agile development methods.

I have used Unix since 1983, Linux since 1994 Yggdrasil, Slackware, Redhat, Suse and Ubuntu for past 3-4 years.

I want to contribute to Ubuntu, more from an educational, mentoring, testing roles than mainstream development, but this may change if I feel inspired by a particular project. My main interests at the moment are in Audio and Video production and also in educating industry and education establishments that Ubuntu can be used as an effective alternative to using a proprietary solution, however since I also understand business requirements and the need to make a profit I appreciate switching to use OSS incrementally, is often the best way forward allowing users and organisations to migrate at their pace being the smoothest transition.

If anyone feels that I can help to their project please let me know.
