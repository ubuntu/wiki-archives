=== Who Am I? ===

I'm Carl Fletcher. I have used Ubuntu for longer than I can remember now, but some of those free ship it cd's came my way and I was amazed how beautifully it worked then. My love for Linux though is shared as openSUSE is something I am involved with...Well I'm a Forum Admin there! But I share my love and Ubuntu has it's fair share. I spend a fair amount of time in the Ubuntu Forum (carl4926). 

I live in the UK's Lake District.

=== Future Goals ===

I plan to keep using and supporting Ubuntu. Not forgetting recommending it to friends.
