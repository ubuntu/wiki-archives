__TOC__

When dropping an API from a framework in a devel series:

* If a complete package is being removed, remove the package from the sdk-libs and sdk-libs-dev
* If necessary, seed the package in the touch and desktop seeds instead, to ensure it remains available at runtime
* Sync with Michael Hall to announce the deprecation
* Add new framework declarations to the frameworks/ directory in ubuntu-touch-meta
* Update click-reviewers-tools to detect use of deprecated APIs
