I am what I am because of what we all are

"We chose the name Ubuntu for our distribution because we think it captures perfectly the spirit of the sharing and cooperation that is at the heart of the open source movement."

It's a movement.

Sharing 

The Ubuntu Philosophy can be great. I like it so much I volunteer to go teach others about it. Open Source is a philosophy, one that I continue to learn more about . Linux needs a to appeal to more than just a niche group. It's not just about computers or software, it is especially about people.
