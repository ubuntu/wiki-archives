'''Greetings Friendly Canada Ubuntu People!'''

I'm interested in hearing from anyone who's part of a Canadian Ubuntu
LoCo or User Group, just to get a finger on the pulse of how active the
Ubuntu community is in this country. If you'd like to participate in my
"informal" survey, please answer the following:

 1. Your city/town, province? 
 2. Name of LoCo (or user-group) you participate in? 
 3. Is it an official (registered) group? 
 4. Website URL: 
 5. How often does it meet? 
 6. How many people normally attend meetings? 

A summary of responses will be shared with the list. Thanks in advance.
