[02:00] <DarkwingDuck> *** START MEETING ***
[02:00] <DarkwingDuck> Greetings fellow team members!
[02:01] <DarkwingDuck> Yes, I'm actually chairing a meeting tonight.
[02:01] <pleia2> *gasps from the audience*
[02:01] <DarkwingDuck> okay smart butt. :P:P
[02:01] <pleia2> at least I didn't say something about kde
[02:01] <DarkwingDuck> Seeing that I just came from one of those meetings... Thank you :P
[02:01] <pleia2> :)
[02:01] <DarkwingDuck> Our agenda tonight is kinda short and sweet. (maybe)
[02:02] <DarkwingDuck> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CaliforniaTeam/Meetings/11March13 for the list of items
[02:02]  * DarkwingDuck pauses
[02:02] <DarkwingDuck> Is anyone here other then pleia2 and myself?
[02:02] <grantbow> o/
[02:02] <akk> o/
[02:02] <DarkwingDuck> Okay, scale fallout
[02:03] <DarkwingDuck> overall i felt that Ubucon was a HUGE success
[02:03] <pleia2> nhaines did an amazing job with ubucon!
[02:03] <DarkwingDuck> +100 to nhaines for ubucon
[02:03] <DarkwingDuck> speaking of...
[02:03] <pleia2> he said he'd update ubucon.org with links to videos and such when he gets them
[02:04] <DarkwingDuck> Okay good.
[02:04] <DarkwingDuck> The booth did very well too
[02:04] <DarkwingDuck> we handed out around 600 CDs
[02:04] <pleia2> http://www.flickr.com/photos/ubuntu-us-ca << photos from myself and iheartubuntu
[02:05] <DarkwingDuck> and about half of that amount was pressed CDs
[02:05] <grantbow> nice
[02:05] <iheartubuntu> im interested to hand out 1000 next time
[02:05] <pleia2> iheartubuntu was a cd sleeve folding machine :)
[02:06] <pleia2> and erichammond showed us how to fold them (thankfully!)
[02:06] <DarkwingDuck> I have talked to jono about the CD issue we had and he gave me the names of a couple of people to talk to so we can get many many more CDs next year
[02:06] <DarkwingDuck> A BIG shout out to all of you who showed up. It was fun to put a face to these IRC nicks
[02:07] <DarkwingDuck> Any other positive fallout?
[02:07] <iheartubuntu> ive started an ubuntu hour with richard gaskin
[02:07] <DarkwingDuck> Other then loads of people that talked to me about KDE and Kubuntu :D
[02:07] <iheartubuntu> first one in pasadena :)
[02:07] <DarkwingDuck> Oh good.
[02:07] <iheartubuntu> and hope philip and i can do one in claremont when he is up here
[02:08] <iheartubuntu> seidos and i are now talking about one in lakewood area
[02:08] <DarkwingDuck> Awesome. There are rumors of another one down here in San Diego too
[02:09] <DarkwingDuck> Anything else from SCALE?
[02:09] <iheartubuntu> San gabriel LUG wants me to speak
[02:09] <iheartubuntu> not sure what to speak on
[02:09] <DarkwingDuck> +1!
[02:09] <iheartubuntu> i will go there a couple times firts
[02:09] <DarkwingDuck> Unity!
[02:09] <iheartubuntu> first
[02:09] <DarkwingDuck> :D
[02:09] <pleia2> if anyone else has photos and wants them up on the flickr page just let me know (grab me on irc or email lyz@ubuntu.com)
[02:09] <pleia2> this goes for scale, ubuntu hours, etc etc
[02:09] <DarkwingDuck> Sweet
[02:10] <iheartubuntu> jbermudes is excited about pasadena ubuntu hour too! so we should have minimum 3 people attending and enjoying the time
[02:10] <grantbow> great
[02:10] <seidos> when is it again iheartubuntu?
[02:11] <iheartubuntu> 2nd thursday of every month
[02:11] <iheartubuntu> peets coffee - corner of lake ave and california blvd
[02:11] <iheartubuntu> two blocks from cal tech
[02:11] <pleia2> http://loco.ubuntu.com/events/team/778/detail/ is the 1st
[02:11] <iheartubuntu> which is where the LUG meets
[02:11] <seidos> cool
[02:11] <iheartubuntu> ty
[02:11] <DarkwingDuck> Okay, next item on the list...
[02:11] <DarkwingDuck> Ubuntu Global Jam
[02:12] <iheartubuntu> so it will be a ubuntu hour + head over to the LUG after large amounts of espresso?
[02:12] <seidos> sorry i asked, heh
[02:12] <pleia2> jono organized one in Walnut Creek for Friday April 1st: http://loco.ubuntu.com/events/team/701/detail/
[02:12] <seidos> i won't be drinking espresso
[02:12] <DarkwingDuck> From April 1st to the 3rd is the Ubuntu Global Jam. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuGlobalJam
[02:12] <DarkwingDuck> These Jams can be a host of things.
[02:12] <seidos> i think i'm on the same drug that Sheen is on
[02:12] <pleia2> I have work that day, but jdeslip floated the idea of having one in Berkeley on Sunday, so I'll follow up with him about planning that (we did a Lucid jam there too)
[02:13] <DarkwingDuck> Bug jams, packaging jams, Translation jams, Doc jams, testing jams and Upgrade jams
[02:13] <seidos> spread jam
[02:13] <seidos> ha
[02:13] <DarkwingDuck> I will be holding a doc jam on one of those days via IRC for Kubuntu Docs
[02:14] <pleia2> cool
[02:14] <iheartubuntu> so how does a jam work? people meet in person or online
[02:14] <DarkwingDuck> Both.
[02:14]  * akk was just listening to cartalk, a woman who got jam in her automatic shifter and it wouldn't shift any more :)
[02:14] <DarkwingDuck> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuGlobalJam
[02:14] <grantbow> akk: different kind of jam here, lol
[02:14] <DarkwingDuck> hehehe
[02:14] <pleia2> the lucid global jam in berkeley worked well for both last year, a bunch of us met for pizza and worked on things, we were working on a flier that we posted to the list and talked about in IRC during the jam :)
[02:15] <DarkwingDuck> Awesome.
[02:15] <pleia2> and grantbow and I did mini presentations
[02:15]  * grantbow nods
[02:15] <DarkwingDuck> The mean reason I won't be able to do much is that the Doc freeze is on the 7th and that is my final crunch time. :/
[02:16] <DarkwingDuck> So, I figured I would host a IRC Kubuntu Doc jam
[02:16] <pleia2> DarkwingDuck: here or with kubuntu people?
[02:16] <DarkwingDuck> Anyone
[02:16] <akk> With all the talk about opportunistic development, how come there are no development jams?
[02:16] <pleia2> I mean, where on IRC :)
[02:17] <DarkwingDuck> Oh, I'll be creating a channel for it.
[02:17] <DarkwingDuck> I'm almost finished drafting that email.
[02:17] <pleia2> akk: global jams can be anything, so a development jam is fine
[02:17] <pleia2> these started out as global bug jams, until one day there were a massive number of newbies around the world triaging bugs and making a mess that the bug squad had to clean up after :\
[02:17] <DarkwingDuck> The doc jam I'm holding will be Kubuntu because the system docs for ubuntu and kubuntu are different on many levels
[02:18] <DarkwingDuck> Anyway, I had forwarded Jorge's email on it to the ML and I will forward it again.
[02:18] <pleia2> so now it's "whatever your expertise is and you want to share it with others" jam :)
[02:18] <grantbow> right, contributing to Ubuntu encompases more than code and bugs but those are certainly welcome
[02:18] <jledbetter> that's cool
[02:19] <pleia2> DarkwingDuck: you can just reply to the same email and say we'll talk about it, no need to reforward :)
[02:19] <DarkwingDuck> Works too. :)
[02:19] <DarkwingDuck> Anyway, if we want to get some jams setup this is the time to plan it.
[02:20] <DarkwingDuck> We can announce finals at the next meeting
[02:20] <pleia2> once you plan a jam, make a loco.ubuntu.com directory about it and add it here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CaliforniaTeam/Projects/NattyGlobalJam
[02:21] <pleia2> (ask anyone here if you have questions about using loco.ubuntu.com)
[02:22] <DarkwingDuck> If you have any more questions about Jams please, ask away. :)
[02:22] <DarkwingDuck> If not, we can roll onto release parties.
[02:22] <pleia2> onward!
[02:22] <DarkwingDuck> Now, I know that this is a while out but, I wanted to touch base on this
[02:23] <DarkwingDuck> Normally a release party requires more planning because of the space required.
[02:23] <DarkwingDuck> Natty releases on April 28
[02:23] <DarkwingDuck> So, maybe an install-fest/release parties in the beginning of May will work out nicely.
[02:24] <iheartubuntu> (general questions can be asked at the end of the meeting?)
[02:24] <seidos> oh, i have a question, has anyone considered having a jam at a hacker space?
[02:24] <pleia2> seidos: yep, hackerspaces are fine places for jams :)
[02:24] <seidos> there's apparently a hacker space here in LA
[02:24] <iheartubuntu> what is a hackerspace
[02:25] <seidos> like a space where hackers meet
[02:25] <pleia2> hackerspaces.org
[02:25] <akk> Usually someone who's a member of the hackerspace has to host it -- at least that's how it works with hacker dojo here.
[02:25] <seidos> ah, i knew there would be caveats
[02:25] <pleia2> noisebridge in SF is more open than hacker dojo, you have to check with each space for their policies
[02:25] <seidos> i guess crashing a hackerspace is looked down upon in the hacker community
[02:26] <pleia2> depends on the space
[02:26] <grantbow> depends
[02:26] <seidos> has anyone done it?
[02:26] <pleia2> we had an installfest at noisebridge
[02:26] <grantbow> You don't have to crash if you are a regular.
[02:26] <seidos> did it go well?
[02:26] <pleia2> it went great :)
[02:26] <DarkwingDuck> Unless I can do it from home it is hard for me to get to places... the joys of three young kids
[02:26] <grantbow> I think it went well, yes
[02:26] <seidos> did you ask someone before you started inviting people?
[02:27] <seidos> i can't even do it from home, since i don't have my own place
[02:27] <pleia2> seidos: our experience won't be the same as at other hackerspaces, you need to check the rules of your local one
[02:27] <seidos> the joys of being a loser :)
[02:27] <seidos> pleia2: sorry i asked
[02:27] <pleia2> grantbow is at noisebridge all the time, so we just needed to set aside the space and time
[02:27] <DarkwingDuck> :)
[02:28] <DarkwingDuck> Going back to release parties... if you are setting one up please, please please update the info here. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CaliforniaTeam/Projects/NattyRelease
[02:28] <pleia2> thanks to grantbow for putting up the page
[02:28] <DarkwingDuck> Whoot!
[02:29] <pleia2> I'll give jono a nudge and see if he has thoughts on one, he usually likes to host one in SF at thirsty bear brewing
[02:29] <DarkwingDuck> Anything else on release parties? We have plenty of time to get things setup
[02:29] <iheartubuntu> what goes on at a release... jsut a glorified ubuntu hour? :)
[02:29] <iheartubuntu> with the new release of course
[02:29] <pleia2> iheartubuntu: you can have a party, or have an installfest, or do whatever
[02:30] <grantbow> often the party is too close to the release to have media available, so it's usually a social event.
[02:30] <DarkwingDuck> Some people get together for drinks
[02:30] <akk> or combine it with a jam
[02:30] <pleia2> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CaliforniaTeam/Projects/LucidRelease shows the variation of our events (Lucid was an LTS so a big release, we did *a lot*
[02:30] <DarkwingDuck> Other help with upgrades and installs
[02:30] <pleia2> )
[02:30] <eps> If we use a hackerspace, we can have our own food, as opposed to whatever a restaurant/bar limits you to
[02:30] <seidos> there's two answers, the simplified one, and the glorified hyped up propagandified electrified stupendous answer
[02:30] <DarkwingDuck> Loads of goody joyness
[02:30] <DarkwingDuck> seidos: +1
[02:31] <DarkwingDuck> Next on the list is something I have been wanting to do for a while now.
[02:31] <DarkwingDuck> Training
[02:31] <DarkwingDuck> If you have ever wanted how to do soemthing. Bug running, docs, packaging, dev ect ect
[02:31] <seidos> you can bring your own drinks and food to a bar, but you gotta' use Jedi mind tricks and stealth
[02:31] <DarkwingDuck> We wnat to help setup training for these things.
[02:31] <pleia2> seidos: most won't allow it (it can get you thrown out)
[02:32] <seidos> pleia2: you will not throw me out *waves hand*
[02:32] <akk> and it's a good way to have your event not welcome there in the future
[02:32] <jledbetter> DarkwingDuck, Great idea
[02:32] <akk> DarkwingDuck: Local in-person training, or online/irc?
[02:32] <seidos> no way
[02:32] <pleia2> DarkwingDuck: the Ubuntu Learning project exists, but it's woefully low on volunteers to write courses, if ubuntu-us-ca wanted to help I'd be grateful
[02:33] <DarkwingDuck> I'll help out with that too pleia2
[02:33] <iheartubuntu> i want to know training :) great idea
[02:33] <seidos> why couldn't the wiki be the course material?
[02:33] <iheartubuntu> see pleia2 ^^
[02:33] <pleia2> seidos: it can be the basis of material, but teaching a class is more than just reading from a book/wiki :)
[02:34] <seidos> pleia2: like what do you have in mind besides reading from a book?
[02:34] <DarkwingDuck> seidos: The wiki is good info... taking packaging for example... Packaging on the wiki is horrible to look at. Once I had someone walk me throughit became a breeze
[02:34] <seidos> so there is no packaging walk through, interesting
[02:34] <DarkwingDuck> Oh there is
[02:34] <seidos> it's just mind numbingly boring?
[02:34] <DarkwingDuck> took me 5 hours to read all of it
[02:35] <seidos> did it take 5 hours to walk through it when you worked with someone?
[02:35] <DarkwingDuck> So, would anyone be interested in learning about things like packaging or bug triage?
[02:35] <akk> Most ubuntu/debian packaging tutorials take the approach "there are 5 different ways to do this, it's a matter of taste which one you pick, here's a bizarre hybrid of 3 of the techniques switching randomly between them".
[02:35] <seidos> energy cannot be created or destroyed
[02:36] <jledbetter> akk, True
[02:36] <DarkwingDuck> akk: +1
[02:36] <jtatum> â€¦ what?
[02:36] <pleia2> DarkwingDuck: online or off?
[02:36] <seidos> huh interesting
[02:36] <pleia2> and IRC? video?
[02:36] <DarkwingDuck> both
[02:36] <jledbetter> jtatum, no idea
[02:36] <akk> DarkwingDuck: I'd be interested in learning better packaging (and might be able to teach some other topics).
[02:37] <DarkwingDuck> I was thinking ubuntu-classroom stuff
[02:37] <pleia2> I'd also be happy to welcome california folks to #ubuntu-classroom for anything any time :)
[02:37] <iheartubuntu> packaging of DEBs?
[02:37] <DarkwingDuck> But even beyond that
[02:37] <pleia2> we organize in #ubuntu-classroom-backstage
[02:37] <seidos> why can't we learn in this channel?
[02:38] <eps> packaging _and_ PPAs
[02:38] <akk> Has anybody tried in-person packaging tutorials, like "Let's spend 3 hours and each person will actually get something packaged in that time"?
[02:38] <akk> I've been to a few of the #ubuntu-classroom sessions, and they're helpful but they go way too fast for people to keep up and actually do it right then.
[02:38] <DarkwingDuck> I have, but that was becasue of what I was packaging
[02:39] <DarkwingDuck> So it sounds like this might be something good?
[02:39] <akk> (and I'm not criticising them -- I think they go at the right speed considering there's another class coming up right afterward)
[02:39] <seidos> ah, no wonder i'm not interested in packaging.  i have nothing to package.
[02:40] <grantbow> eps: ppas are not so bad: https://help.launchpad.net/Packaging/PPA/InstallingSoftware
[02:40] <pleia2> DarkwingDuck: sounds good!
[02:40] <iheartubuntu> double good!
[02:40] <DarkwingDuck> Awesome, I'll work on gettig a wiki setup for it and look on the ML for it too!
[02:40] <DarkwingDuck> Okay, that about wraps up the agenda. We now open the floor to anything else?
[02:41] <iheartubuntu> yes
[02:41] <iheartubuntu> uno momento
[02:42] <iheartubuntu> ok. this tuesday i will be placing an order with Ubuntu Store
[02:42] <iheartubuntu> to help save on the shipping
[02:42] <grantbow> we can chat after the meeting too.
[02:42] <iheartubuntu> details I put out on the mailing list here: https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-us-ca/2011-March/001589.html
[02:42] <iheartubuntu> ordering a big item yourself like a backpack might cost $50
[02:43] <iheartubuntu> or just some stickers along might cost you $10
[02:43] <iheartubuntu> if we group the order, then shipping should be down to $5 a person
[02:43] <iheartubuntu> nhaines brought up that there may be new merchandise soon for Natty release
[02:43] <iheartubuntu> so keep that in mind
[02:44] <iheartubuntu> im still ordering no matter
[02:44] <iheartubuntu> (done)
[02:44] <DarkwingDuck> How do we get the money to you?
[02:44] <jledbetter> iheartubuntu, Thank you :)
[02:44] <iheartubuntu> paypal
[02:44] <DarkwingDuck> Okay sweet
[02:44] <DarkwingDuck> If the store sold up to date Kubuntu items I would :P
[02:45] <iheartubuntu> please IM me and i will give out my email addy. since this is logged i wont post it here
[02:45] <DarkwingDuck> Anything else?
[02:46] <iheartubuntu> i have a few questions, but can wait till the end
[02:46] <iheartubuntu> unless now is a good time
[02:46] <DarkwingDuck> If there is nothing else the meeting ends. Next meeting will be held in two weeks on the 27th of March at 7p
[02:46] <DarkwingDuck> ** END MEETING **
