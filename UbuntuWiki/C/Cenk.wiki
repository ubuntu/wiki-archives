I intend to conduct tests on primarily Fujitsu-Siemens Primergy Intel based servers. With these tests, I intend to help developing necessary packages for Fujitsu-Siemens Primergy server installations that work out-of-the-box.

More information about Primergy servers are available at http://www.fujitsu-siemens.com/products/standard_servers/index.html

Cheers
