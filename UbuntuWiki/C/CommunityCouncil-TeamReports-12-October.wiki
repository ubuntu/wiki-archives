** Kubuntu Council catchup
** Began with reminding attendees that Canonical dropped them as a supported flavour earlier this year and the felt the announcement for that was handled poorly by Canonical, as the only communication to the kubuntu community was an e-mail which didn't have many details and led to a lot of confusion
*** Note: they are still a recognized flavor, but they no longer get financial support
** They now we have a company who wants to sponsor Kubuntu by providing a the support service Canonical dropped, but "nothing is moving forward" to transfer rights to support Kubuntu by new company
*** Feel no deliberate attempt to restrict kubuntu there, but they feel so low down on the priority list it just doesn't get done
** Lack of progress is very demotivating for contributors
** There is also an outstanding ticket from August about some updates to the Kubuntu website, no response from IS
*** This is also demotivating to the contributors
*** They are interested in moving it off Canonical's servers, but there are questions about aforementioned control of the Kubuntu brand
*** czajkowski following up with IS to see if progress can be made
** Asked Canonical Community team where to put Kubuntu-focused sessions
*** jono replied: "just put them on the logical tracks (E.g. Desktop for KDE related topics, Foundations for lower level bits, Community for governance)"
** Seem to have a good number of contributors, but not sure they're doing as good at recruitment as we have done
** Do you think the kubuntu community is working out fine generally? just in terms of getting things done? "For distro development yes I think so"
** Code of Conduct review (<nowiki>[[http://fridge.ubuntu.com/2012/09/27/code-of-conduct-v2-request-for-feedback/|call for review was posted here]]</nowiki>)
** No mails sent in during call for review
** we only got one applicable comment on the fridge post, "make it easier to sign"
** shall we have a session at UDS that is CC + CoC?
