=== Usage ===

ConnMan can be used in two different ways, either with Network Menu found from the panel or via a command-line tool called cmcc , both are in indicator-network package.

Current usage options:

* Wired: plug in cable and network will be automatically enabled
* Wi-Fi: click indicator icon and choose network
* Wi-Fi security: a dialog asks passphrase from user during connection establishment
* Command-line tool cmcc for debugging and editing connections. For usage run:

    {{{
cmcc help
    }}}

==== 3G modems ====

For 3G modems a separate package ofono is needed. Also it's a good idea to install use-modeswitch also.

   1. Install ofono:
     {{{
sudo apt-get install ofono
     }}}
   1. Install usb-modeswitch:
     {{{
sudo apt-get install usb-modeswitch
     }}}
## Plug in the modem and wait for the initialisation to finish
## Check that cellular network is found:
     {{{
cmcc list
     }}}
   1. Edit APN for the connection (usually it's "internet", but depends on the operator):
     {{{
cmcc edit <connectionname> apn <apnname>
     }}}
   1. Start connection normally using the <nowiki>[[NetworkSettings|NetworkMenu]]</nowiki>
