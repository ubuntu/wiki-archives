__TOC__

=== Performance ===

* Set concurrency to "shell" in /etc/init.d/rc
* Finish and implement the replacement init scripts. Edgy was only edgy under the surface (AIGLX), Feisty lost its teeth (composite by default), and Gutsy better not lose its guts to show the technology world what Linux can do!
* Build i686 optimized packages. Maybe a legacy version for Ubuntu with i386 builds would make sense
