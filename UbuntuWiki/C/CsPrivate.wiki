Describe CsPrivate here.

Hi there. 
I wrote the original content that the Ubuntutoronto.org team gave me feedback on, so now that it's posted I'm trying to match what I intended, and the latest information I have, at the same time as I'm learning how to edit wiki pages. My wikiname itself should tell Dave Sullivan, Corey Burger, and most others who I am :-)

Other than that info, I did have a professional career in HR sales and marketing until I had to retire early, and subsequently moved pretty well exclusively into volunteer work. I'm an artsie (voracious reader) from way back, too, and feel I'm fairly knowledgeable on nonprofit and charity issues, research, culture, and the issues of technology in that sector. 

I'm still a Linux noob from August 2006 onwards, although I do have mythtv working here, so perhaps I'm a quick study?
