During events such as UbuntuOpenWeek, UbuntuDeveloperWeek, and UserDays, there has been a need for "Session Helpers" to do certain tasks. This is an attempt to define some of the tasks that a Session Helper may do:

* Meet with the instructor prior to the session and answer any questions for the instructor and determine how the instructor wants the class run (+m/help with questions, etc.)
* Change <code>#ubuntu-classroom</code> and <code>#ubuntu-classroom-chat</code> topics
* Give instructors Ops/Voice in the channels
* Set #ubuntu-classroom to moderated (+m)
* Assist in moving questions from <code>#ubuntu-classroom-chat</code> to <code>#ubuntu-classroom</code> for the instructor
* Assist with questions in <code>#ubuntu-classroom-chat</code>

The IRC-based commands are now handled by ClassBot, but Helpers still need to handle them if something out of the ordinary happens (need a non-standard topic, instructor rejoins with an alternate nickname, instructor needs another user voiced at last minute, etc).
