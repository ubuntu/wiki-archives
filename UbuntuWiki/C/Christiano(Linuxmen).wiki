I`ve graduated as an accountant, but have been working as a support analyst since 1996, when I got in touch with the free software for the first time. I started as an IT consultant 3 years ago, when I  idealized the Free Desktop event which originated the "Ubuntu - Free your Desktop" presentation.

I  often help on Brazilian Free Software events such as FISL, Conisli, Encontro Ubuntu-SP, Desktop Livre, ESLI, among others. Have been a speaker at Latinoware, Debian Day, Flisol 2006-2007-2008-2009, Ubuntu Uai, TecSul 2008 and many others, always talking about Ubuntu on a desktop. Also collaborate frequently on local Broffice.org (the Brazilian OpenOffice.org name) users group and the Ubuntu-br team.

Besides that, I am the founder and coordinator of the São Paulo LoCo team (www.ubuntu-sp.org) and the www.desktoplivre.org website.

It is expected to become a source of reference on events, meetings, tutorials, support and general info about Ubuntu at the great state of São Paulo. <<BR>> {*} The Ubuntu Games team is a sub-team of Ubuntu-Br-SP, because it is very important to speak about games in GNU/Linux. This is a critical factor for people to migrate from Windows® platform to Linux. Linux was always criticized by everyone who found it bad or complicated, saying that there is very few options of amusement in it; cause the majority of games are only released for Windows®. Then the objective of this team is helping with tutoriais, illustrations, hints of Installations and configurations of the best games for the Ubuntu Linux system. Understanding things this way, the Ubuntu-BR-SP team has embraced the Ubuntu Games Team and has been supporting it since the beggining.'' ;)

I don't do the usual coding or translation but I have been advocating and marketing for Ubuntu since it`s first version, Ubuntu 5.04 - Hoary Hedgehog, on numerous events all over the country.

For example, I was the first person to introduce the Ubuntu Brazil Community to the Brazilian press and other FOSS communities on the first and only Linux Expo World Brazil  which ever took place on 2006, as you can see on this magazine`s blog <nowiki>[[http://info.abril.com.br/fotolog/linuxworld2006/fotos/ubuntu.jpg|archive]]</nowiki>.

I also help lots of people on instant messengers, e-mail, going at their homes or even writing on Ubuntu-SP team`s blog.

=== Plans for the future ===

I am going to spend a special focus on the improvement of the LoCo team. I want it to be the best LoCo team in the country. I want our LoCo team`s meetings to be more regular. We are going to seek for the team`s approval (which we only got to know recently although we`ve been around for a long time... ;-)). We are looking for to bring the community closer to the Ubuntu distribution by promoting install fests and release parties at universities and other places in São Paulo state.

I want to spend some effort on the improvement of the Ubuntu Games project by internationalizing it, which will need lots of the community help. Ubuntu Games have created some debs to put it on it`s own repository. Now we want to send those debs to the universe repository, but this will need some more attention to the debian standards.

==== TESTIMONIALS ====
write a testimonial if you know me :D

{*} Christiano is one of the most passionate users I`ve ever known. I`ve meet him when I needed someone to make a free software speech at the non-profit organization which I work for. He went there and also invited a bunch of other people to speak about other FOSS topics which he was not specialized. He is so community driven that ended up inviting me to make speeches by his side on some FOSS events. How many people would do that? Now I am also an administrator of the LoCo team and try to help him and the others on whatever I can. <nowiki>[[Kemel]]</nowiki>

{*} From many years Christiano has been advocating Ubuntu, has been present in meetings, and helping people to come to the brown side of the force :) . I met Christiano at a FISL and used to talk only by chat. But once, he accepted an invite to speech on an install fest (a little one) and traveled 6 hours on a motorcycle just to it. He is really passionate about Ubuntu. <nowiki>[[AndreNoel]]</nowiki>

{*} Christiano is a great friend and makes also a great job as coordinator of the São Paulo (ubuntu-br-sp) LoCo Team. He strongly supports the development of the Ubuntu Games website, advocates and markets for Ubuntu, Ubuntu Games and Free Desktop in meetings, conferences, and speeches in big and small events in many states of Brazil. He is a strong candidate for a official Ubuntu Member. <nowiki>[[Coringao]]</nowiki>
