=== About Me ===

Hi everyone, I'm '''Luca Ciavatta''' aka '''cialu''', I am from Ravenna, Italy, but I dream to live in Berlin. I'm passionate about IT, tech, Linux and the Open Source World, so I try to spread this wonderful verb as I can.

I have studied Environmental Science at the University of Bologna and I'm also a qualified IT technician.
I like to learn and I'm also a hobbyist-developer. I used many operating systems, but none satisfy me completely, so I switched to Ubuntu and loved it!

* <nowiki>[[https://community.ubuntu.com/t/winners-of-the-ubuntu-17-10-free-culture-showcase/940|Design]]</nowiki>: <<BR>>I have participated in several editions of the '''Ubuntu Free Culture Showcase''', contributing with graphic images, photographs and drawings, made or elaborated through opensource tools such as GIMP and Inkscape. In older cases, I also used proprietary solutions such as Adobe Lightroom or Photoshop. During the cycle for the release of '''Ubuntu 17.10 Artful Aardvark''', one submission of mine was selected and became one of the default wallpapers of the distribution. I am also having fun in creating and editing graphics themes for various Linux DE shell. As for Ubuntu, I have created and maintained <nowiki>[[https://github.com/cialu/AmbianceDF|AmbianceDF]]</nowiki>, a theme based on the classic Ambiance, but modernized with tones of different and lively colors. All the shades, except the characteristic blue of the theme, have been taken from the color palette of the Ubuntu Design brand.

* <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu-it.org/Documentazione/Indice|Wiki]]</nowiki>: <<BR>>Since October 2015 I have been interested in the documentation, creating some updates for pages regarding new releases.
