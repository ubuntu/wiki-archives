=== Operation Cold Comfort ===
This project is an impromptu campaign being worked on members of Ubuntu Canada, taking place on Friday February 2nd at 4PM at Yonge-Dundas Square in Toronto.

We will be handing out CDs and infosheets, and generally raising awareness for Ubuntu and free software, right near the Microsoft Digital Ice House.

We currently have:
* A press release in the works and being sent out
* An infosheet to be mass printed and handed out tomorrow <nowiki>[[http://64.142.120.49/ubuntu-letter-toronto.pdf]]</nowiki>
* Approximately 6-8 people, a few with laptops, ready to hand out sheets and answer questions
* A 10-foot inflatable Tux penguin with a portable power source
