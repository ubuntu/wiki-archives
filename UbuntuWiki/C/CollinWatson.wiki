Hmm....

Name's Collin. I'm graduating from the University of Washington in a few months with a degree in math, however my real interests lie in programming. Specifically, I enjoy the applied aspect of the development cycle rather than a pure theoretical discipline. Currently, I don't have much experience with large projects but I hope to rectify that soon.

I created the <nowiki>[[http://www.dental.washington.edu/ob/|Oral Biology]]</nowiki> website at my University but I would rather not continue in Microsoft land. (I developed the site with ASP.NET......I was forced to!!!)

Anyhoo, my goals here are to contribute, help out and learn along the way.
