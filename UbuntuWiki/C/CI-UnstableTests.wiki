__TOC__

== Process to promote an image with failing tests ==
The purpose of this process is to be able to promote an image with failing tests, when the test has been identified as a non-regression, and fix these unstable tests to make them reliable.

# Get a list of failures from the CI dashboard
# For each failure on the dashboard
### CI file a bug against the project with the failure
### CI either run the test manually or ask dev (test must be run by hand)     1. QA documents manual steps if not already documented.  1. If --
### test passes in manual execution:
#### CI retargets the bug against the infrastructure  [QA or CI owns / investigates]
#### Promote the build if there is no other regression
### test fails in manual execution:
#### CI retargets the bug against the production code/application [Dev owns / looks]
#### Reject the build

=== Questions ===

* Q: What is the incentive for people to fix broken tests? 
* A: Give people 2 weeks to fix the test, after this time, block the build

=== Landing email changes ===

* Include bug number for every test with problems
* date of each bug 
* time it has been open
* before an issue is removed from the landing email, QA verifies how this has been fixed.
