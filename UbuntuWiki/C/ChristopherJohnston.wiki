=== About Me ===

My name is Chris Johnston. I live in Orlando, FL. My day job is a !FireFighter Paramedic, but in my spare time I am a computer enthusiast. I have been running an Ubuntu Server since 7.10 and as a desktop since 8.04. 

I was awarded membership to <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntumembers|Ubuntu Members]]</nowiki> on December 7, 2009 by the Americas Regional Membership Board.

I am currently one of the lead developers for the Community Website Project, which includes the Summit Scheduler, LoCo Team Portal, and the community supported web themes.

==== Ubuntu User Days ====

Ubuntu User Days was born out of a discussion at the Ubuntu Developers Summit in November 2009 regarding Ubuntu Open Week not being targeted enough at users. Ubuntu User Days was created to be a set of classes offered during a one day period to teach the beginning or intermediate Ubuntu user the basics to get them started with Ubuntu, including:

* Learn how to install Ubuntu
* Learn how to find equivalent programs in Ubuntu
* Learn how to get help with Ubuntu
* Learn the basics of how to use Ubuntu
* Learn how to get involved in the community
* And more! For our full schedule head over to https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UserDays

I have been a lead for the Ubuntu User Days project since its inception, recruiting instructors, creating a class list and schedule, designing the website, promoting, and hosting the event.

Our first Ubuntu User Days was January 23, 2010. We had 13 instructors teach on 14 different topics throughout the day.

=== Testimonials ===

==== Ubuntu Beginners Team Council 2010 ====

===== Nathan Handler (nhandler) =====
I have been able to work with Chris through the Ubuntu Beginners Team as well as through the Ubuntu Classroom. He is very hard working, and he always has new ideas on how to improve things. Chris is also a relatively new member to the Ubuntu Beginners Team, so he will have different views on how to handle any issues that come up, which could prove to be very beneficial. I support his nomination for the Ubuntu Beginners Team Council. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:nhandler]]</nowiki> 
===== Nigel Babu (nigelb) =====
I've worked with Chris through various teams and I'm certainly +1 for him.  He is open to new ideas and improvising throughout.  His enthusiasm for ubuntu has no bounds and I certainly hope he becomes a council member @-- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:nigelbabu]]</nowiki> @

==== Ubuntu Membership 2009 ====

Even though he has only been a member of the Florida !LoCo for a short time, Chris has been very active in our online and in person events.  He is always willing to offer help and expertise to us in the IRC channel, and he blogs regularly blogs on Ubuntu subjects.  His blog has also been included in <nowiki>[[http://planet.ubuntu-fl.org]]</nowiki>.  He has also taken the lead on getting our new <nowiki>[[http://family.ubuntu-fl.org|family-oriented website]]</nowiki> up and running.  I have met Chris and his family on a couple of occasions, and look forward to interacting with him more.  He is already becoming an invaluable member of our !LoCo, and I only see than increasing in the future. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:mhall119]]</nowiki> 
I second the kind words that mhall119 has previously said. Chris has a passion for Ubuntu. It's obvious whenever you talk with him, I look forward to seeing good things from him for the Florida Team and Ubuntu! -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:itnet7]]</nowiki>
