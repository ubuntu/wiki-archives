 02:03:27 <nhaines> Is there anything to look forward to in June?
 02:03:36 <dax> end of the school year
 02:03:42 <nhaines> That can be one thing!
 02:04:36 <nhaines> My friends' kids got out of school last week, but the one I'm affected by is still in school until the 23rd!
 02:05:03 <nhaines> Well, with school ending and summer starting, it's a great time to plan get togethers once vacations and all that settle down, so keep that in mind.

 02:08:39 <nhaines> We can always improve things further, so anyone should feel welcome to bring up any suggestions on the mailing list.
 02:08:48 <nhaines> Are there any other announements for this meeting?
 02:10:25 <nhaines> Okay, with the new leadership document in place, I'll work with lynorian and pleia2 to organize a new call for nominations so we can get our election process started up again.
 02:11:10 <nhaines> Oh!  Announcement: the Ubuntu 17.10 Free Culture Showcase is going to run from June 1st to June 30th, so if you're a photographer, start thinking about nice Ubuntu background images.  :)
