'''Chris Bonner'''

Have been using Linux since 2001/2, or about then! Started off using SUSE Linux 5.2, then SUSE Linux 7.1 for PowerPC. Used SUSE through to version 9.1. Used Fedora for a while, but have now found happiness with Ubuntu!

Founded Portsmouth LUG in November 2005, to build a local community to support Linux users in the area.

Currenty working as a Network Administrator in a secondary school, and am very interested in the Edubuntu project. It has great potential!

Interests include: Walking, Cycling, Music, amongst others.
