[02:03] <pleia2> who all is here for the meeting?
[02:03] <nhaines> I'm mostly just keeping an eye on it.  :)

[02:04] <pleia2> agenda, empty ;)
[02:05] <pleia2> SFSU had a software freedom day event on Thursday, some pictures: https://twitter.com/SFStateCommons/status/512658985002881024
[02:05] <darthrobot> Title: [Commons at SF State on Twitter: "Software Freedom Day 2014 at #SFSU. http://t.co/YSrcTchYa0"]
[02:05] <pleia2> a sharp eye will notice some Ubuntu DVDs ;)
[02:06] <pleia2> I think we found out a bit too late for any team members to head over, I gave Sameer the disks last month
[02:06] <nhaines> I wasn't aware that OpenDisc was still a thing.
[02:06] <pleia2> jyo has reached out to at least one possible venue for SF 14.10 release, so that's chugging along
[02:07] <pleia2> (I'll be out of town)
[02:08] <pleia2> I think that's all I had
[02:08] <nhaines> OCLUG might be doing an installfest in December.  They had some scheduling issues with their venue and want to reschedule presentations before then--installfests take up their entire meeting time.  :)
[02:08] <pleia2> cool
[02:08] <nhaines> I'm also trying to convince some of them to help out with the Ubuntu booth.
[02:08] <pleia2> at scale?
[02:08] <nhaines> That'd be the the booth at SCALE.
[02:08] <nhaines> Yep.
[02:09] <pleia2> call for papers for scale is open now: https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/cfp
[02:09] <darthrobot> Title: [Call for Papers | SCALE 13x]
[02:10] <nhaines> I'd like to organize the SCALE booth this year.
[02:10] <pleia2> :D
[02:10] <pleia2> I'm not sure if I'll be going
[02:11] <nhaines> Aww.  But I need you, Phillip, and JosÃ© to sign my Ubuntu book so that it can go on ebay^W^W^W^Whas more sentimental value to me.
[02:11] <pleia2> haha
[02:11] <DonkeyHotei> i finally upgraded my main machine from precise to trusty, and the hiccups are really annoying me
[02:12] <pleia2> anything else team wise before we wrap up?
[02:12] <DonkeyHotei> will there be conference packs for scale?
[02:13] <pleia2> we'll request the standard one from Canonical
[02:14] <nhaines> I don't have anything else.  Other than that I'm going to try to put together a talk for SCALE.
[02:14] <nhaines> Nothing like a chance to push my book.  ;)
[02:14] <pleia2> \o/
[02:14] <DonkeyHotei> at this point i don't expect to be able to afford parking let alone accommodations
[02:14] <nhaines> Also, I'm going to try to get extra discs for SCALE.
[02:14] <pleia2> good idea
[02:15] <nhaines> It's huge.  I think we can sneak in a community reimbursement request.
[02:15] <pleia2> I'll make sure some copies of The Ubuntu Book make it down, will send them down with someone if I don't go
[02:15] <pleia2> yeah
[02:15] <nhaines> (Also maybe a Meizu MX4 with Ubuntu... well, I can *ask*)
[02:15] <pleia2> hehe
[02:15] <pleia2> I hear getting them in the US won't be simple
[02:15] <pleia2> alas
[02:15] <DonkeyHotei> what's a meizu?
[02:16] <pleia2> a phone
[02:16] <nhaines> I heard it'd was just an online order like anything else.
[02:16] <DonkeyHotei> ah
[02:16] <pleia2> that would be nice
[02:16] <nhaines> DonkeyHotei: phone manufacturer.  Along with BQ Reader, the first two commercial Ubuntu phone partnerse.
[02:16] <nhaines> We'll see.  MX4 Ubuntu preorders start on Thursday and phones ship in December.
[02:16]  * pleia2 nods
[02:17] <DonkeyHotei> i'd want a phone with a physical keyboard AND a physical dialpad
[02:17] <nhaines> DonkeyHotei: there are tons.
[02:18] <pleia2> ok, thanks for coming nhaines and DonkeyHotei :)
