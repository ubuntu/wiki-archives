__TOC__

I'm currently the IT Manager at the <nowiki>[[http://dharma.org/|Insight Meditation Society]]</nowiki> in Barre, MA.  I've been involved in <nowiki>[[http://www.emdebian.org/|EmDebian project]]</nowiki> in the past. Also some various <nowiki>[[http://www.milw0rm.com/author/365|exploit development]]</nowiki>.  Previously worked for Atipa on large Beowulf clusters running RHEL. Before HPC engineering I worked for Shuffle Master on real-time embedded Linux for casino slot machines.  Prior to that I worked on Yellow Dog Linux for the PowerPC arch.
