=== Oneiric Ideas ===

* Upstart
** automated boot/shutdown testing
*** Use LXC or chroot support on hudson slaves to boot and shutdown w/ all packages shipping upstart scripts installed.
       - Record initctl list output when it looks right, fail tests w/ differs.
** bootup change rc-sysinit to 'start on started networking'
      - network-services and rc2.d -- services which depend on networking being up and configured.
      - network-support-services and rcS.d -- services which may be needed to finish ifup -a ru
        - Non upstart bootup forced this .. ifup -a was run at S40 in rcS
        - Timeout for ifup to avoid stalling the boot?
** clarify socket activation and chroot support
** 1:1 LSB init conditions to upstart abstract jobs/events
** LSB -> upstart job (template?) converter
** New event "default-route-configured" -- jobs that need real internet access (as opposed to being usable on a LAN) can use this to run when a real interface is available and has claimed the default route.

* Bugs
** Opinion Status lightning round
     - 2 minutes for one person argument FOR Confirmed
     - 2 minutes for one person rebuttal FOR Invalid
     - 5 minutes for discussion
     - at 9 minutes per bug, this should allow 5 bugs to be reviewed.
