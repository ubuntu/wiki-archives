Hello, fellow ubuntero. ;) 

As you can see, I'm just digging into Ubuntu community.. I'll do my best to help it just like it helps to me. If you are really curious to know who am I and what I do, you can have a look at my <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/people/cezz|launchpad.net account]]</nowiki> or you can visit my <nowiki>[[http://cezz.pohonet.sk/|homepage]]</nowiki>. I hope, that when somebody sometime will follow those links, there will be more to read, than there is right now. :)
