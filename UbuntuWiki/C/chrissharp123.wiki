=== About Me ===

I'm a thirtysomething librarian and free/open source software end user/advocate who is beginning to delve into programming (Python mainly).  I work for an organization that supports and administers the largest implementation of the <nowiki>[[http://evergreen-ils.org/|Evergreen open source library automation system]]</nowiki>.

I have been using Linux since summer 2007 and Ubuntu since February 2008.  I volunteer (mostly beginner) support on the <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/|Ubuntu Forums]]</nowiki> and very much enjoy using and exploring new free/open source software solutions to problems.
