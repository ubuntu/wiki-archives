==== About me ====

I'm an Ubuntu Core Developer since 2009, member of the Ubuntu Developer Membership board, and former project leader for the Xubuntu flavour of Ubuntu.

Previously an employee of Canonical, I designed and implemented the image building, software package repository management, and release infrastructure used by the Professional Engineering and Services group to deliver Ubuntu pre-installed on eight-to-ten million devices in 2011.

I'm now an engineer in Hewlett-Packard's Office of Corporate Strategy and Technology doing fun cloud R&D stuff :)

I'm always happy to lend a hand or help anyway I can. If you're interested in any of the projects I'm involved in or think I'd be interested in one of yours, please feel free to contact me.
