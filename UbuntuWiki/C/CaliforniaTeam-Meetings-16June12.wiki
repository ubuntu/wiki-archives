[02:01] <lynorian> o/
[02:03] <pleia2> alright, hi lynorian :)
[02:04] <pleia2> #topic Upcoming events
[02:04] <pleia2> nothing in the loco team portal at this time http://loco.ubuntu.com/teams/ubuntu-california/
[02:04] <darthrobot> Title: [Ubuntu California | Ubuntu LoCo Team Portal]
[02:04] <pleia2> our Meetup.com group has the monthly Pasadena Ubuntu Hours, next one coming up in July http://www.meetup.com/Ubuntu-California/
[02:04] <darthrobot> [403] Title: [Attention Required! | CloudFlare]
[02:05] <pleia2> we'll talk about 16.04 events being planned in a few minutes
[02:05] <pleia2> any others anyone is aware of?
[02:05] <lynorian> pleia2, no
[02:07] <pleia2> ok
[02:07] <pleia2> #topic Announcements
[02:07] <pleia2> are there any? :)
[02:07]  * lynorian does not have any
[02:09] <pleia2> ok, we'll keep things going then
[02:09] <pleia2> #topic 16.04 release parties, presentations
[02:10] <pleia2> so there was the micro release party back in april that Michael Paoli hosted, but that seems to be pretty much it so far for California
[02:10] <pleia2> that one was at BUUG (berkeley unix users group) on release day http://loco.ubuntu.com/events/ubuntu-california/3364-ubuntu-1604-xenial-xerus-release-micro-party-berkeley/
[02:10] <darthrobot> Title: [Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial Xerus Release micro-"Party" - Berkeley | Ubuntu LoCo Team Portal]
[02:11] <lynorian> Yeah I know I don't really know of venues that much and got really busy with things like my dad going into the hospital
[02:11] <pleia2> as I mentioned at the last meeting, I've been searching for a venue for something in San Francisco and think I finally found one :)
[02:11] <pleia2> lynorian: eep, sorry to hear
[02:11] <pleia2> I've also been busy, but thankfully nothing bad
[02:12] <pleia2> I'm working with the organizer at a venue this week, so should have an announcement for an SF release party in the end of July in the next few days
[02:12] <pleia2> I'll also be giving a couple 16.04 presentations, the first is two weeks away in Felton at FeltonLUG on Saturday, June 25th
[02:13] <pleia2> then on July 19th at the Bay Area Linux Users Group meeting, that one will be pretty casual since there's no projector or anything
[02:13] <pleia2> I'll likely be skipping the Ubuntu Hour in San Francisco again in July since I have all this other stuff going on
[02:14] <pleia2> I'll forward details about both these things to the list so others who don't read these meeting logs will be kept in the loop :)
[02:14] <pleia2> once the announcements go out
[02:15] <pleia2> so, all around good news and things happening here in SF, should be a good summer for us
[02:15] <pleia2> #topic Any other business
[02:15]  * lynorian does not have any
[02:16] <pleia2> ok, hopefully once I announce the SF party this week it'll inspire some others ;)
[02:16] <pleia2> I'll also update the wiki this week to add a page about release stuff so it's all in one place
[02:17] <lynorian> pleia2, good
[02:20] <pleia2> alright, sounds like we can wrap this up then
[02:20] <pleia2> thanks for joining me, lynorian :)
