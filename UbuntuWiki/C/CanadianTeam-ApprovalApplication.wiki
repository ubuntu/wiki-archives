Ubuntu Canada is a currently growing group of Ubuntu users in Canada, mostly centred around Victoria, Toronto and Montreal. Currently led by CoreyBurger in Victoria, Ubuntu Canada has had some ups and downs, being one of the earliest loco teams to form and one of the earliest to have interest wither away. Ubuntu Canada has a number of very experienced members, including CoreyBurger, DanielRobitaille and DaveSullivan, all of whom have extensive connections and have done extensive work in the larger Ubuntu community. One SFD is down and a few conference attendences, we hope to grow our list of press contacts and conference attendences over the next year or so.
