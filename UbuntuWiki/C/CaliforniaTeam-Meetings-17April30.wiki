[02:01] <pleia2> anyone here for the Ubuntu California meeting? :)
[02:04] <pleia2> our agenda is looking pretty sparse as well
[02:04] <pleia2> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CaliforniaTeam/Meetings/17April30
[02:04] <darthrobot`> Title: [CaliforniaTeam/Meetings/17April30 - Ubuntu Wiki]
[02:05] <RogueScholar> I'm here for the meeting, sorry was AFK.
[02:06] <pleia2> welcome RogueScholar :)
[02:06] <pleia2> so we start these things off by talking about upcoming events
[02:06] <pleia2> #topic Upcoming events
[02:06] <RogueScholar> Much obliged, Pleia2. Glad to be here. :)
[02:07] <pleia2> I don't have anything scheduled for San Francisco at the moment (I've been too busy) but there is a local who is interested in helping out and to whom I owe an email
[02:07] <pleia2> the monthly Ubuntu Hours in Pasadena are still happening, can see details and RSVP on our meetup page https://www.meetup.com/Ubuntu-California/
[02:07] <darthrobot`> Title: [Ubuntu California LoCo (Los Angeles, CA)| Meetup]
[02:07] <pleia2> next one is on May 11th, they happen right before the San Gabriel Valley Linux User Group meeting, so it's a good night
[02:08] <pleia2> I think that's all we really have event-wise
[02:08] <pleia2> #topic Any other business
[02:08] <pleia2> this is the wild west part of the meeting :)
[02:09] <pleia2> RogueScholar: what brings you here?
[02:10] <RogueScholar> Well I've been in IT for going on a couple decades now, and I feel like part of my professional development at this stage needs to be promoting the causes that I care about.
[02:10] <pleia2> that's great to hear, using Ubuntu where you work?
[02:11] <RogueScholar> Haha, don't I wish. No I get to save that enjoyment for my personal PCs and homelab.
[02:11] <pleia2> ah, fair enough, I remember those days
[02:12] <RogueScholar> Truth be told, I'm not much of a Linux veteran, I think I onboarded with 14.04.
[02:12] <pleia2> that's ok, always people coming and going from linux spheres, so it's nice to see new blood
[02:13] <RogueScholar> Thanks, I'm relieved to see that there's not a certain threshold of prior involvement in order to participate here.
[02:13] <pleia2> not at all, I always like to say that if you've been using Ubuntu a day longer than someone else, you have something to teach ;)
[02:14] <RogueScholar> In regards to your mention of a San Francisco event, I too am a NorCal person, though a few hours north of SF, so please keep me in mind for activities up in this area.
[02:14] <pleia2> a lot of our month to month events are pretty basic, "Ubuntu Hours" where we just go to a coffee shop and chat about the latest Ubuntu news and projects we're working on (both at work and as hobbies)
[02:14] <pleia2> oh, good to know, have you been to North Bay LUG before? it's in Sebastopol http://nblug.org/
[02:14] <darthrobot`> Title: [North Bay Linux Usersâ€™ Group]
[02:15] <RogueScholar> No I haven't, but I know Sebastopol very well, it's barely a couple hours away. I'm bookmarking them as we chat. :)
[02:15] <pleia2> nice folks, often have super interesting meetings
[02:15] <pleia2> I wish I could make it up, but from SF it's quite the hike on a week night
[02:15] <RogueScholar> Oh you're based up north as well?
[02:16] <pleia2> I live in downtown SF
[02:16] <RogueScholar> In looking over the group page it seemed there was a heavy slant towards SoCal, so I just kind of assumed the leadership probably resided there as well.
[02:17] <pleia2> we're pretty spread out :)
[02:17] <RogueScholar> Well if I can drive to Sebastopol from Fort Bragg, then you can make the trek too. ;)
[02:17] <pleia2> haha
[02:18] <pleia2> I also work with a non-profit based in the bay area, Partimus.org, so some of our time is spent working with low-incoming housing facilities and schools (though fewer schools now) to put Linux-based machines in for residents and students
[02:19] <pleia2> I'd say right now that's where most of my effort is focused Ubuntu-wise locally, instead of Ubuntu Hours
[02:19] <RogueScholar> Oh no kidding?? I was just reading about their work not long ago, I wish I could recall where.
[02:22] <pleia2> alright, I think we'll wrap up this meeting
[02:22] <pleia2> usually nhandler and lynorian at least are also here, but quiet night :)
[02:23] <pleia2> err, nhaines
[02:23] <RogueScholar> It happens; spring is in the air.
[02:23] <pleia2> but sometimes nhandler too! he's in london right now though
[02:23] <pleia2> hope you got out to enjoy the weather today :) was gorgeous down here
[02:24] <pleia2> and with that, let's conclude!
