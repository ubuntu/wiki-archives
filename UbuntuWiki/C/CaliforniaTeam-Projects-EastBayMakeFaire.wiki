Similar to our booth at the Solano Stroll, we are going to be mostly demoing Ubuntu on various hardware and distributing Ubuntu discs, brochures and pamphlets.  Additionally, we are located next to the Fixit Clinic - and the organizer is encouraging people to bring in old laptops etc... to try Ubuntu on.  If he repairs their computer hardware, we can give them an Ubuntu disc to take home with them.  

Things we have so far:

1 Ubuntu/Linux Banner

1 Tent

2 Tables

3 Chairs

1 Demo Ubuntu Box and TV

1 Stuffed Penguin and Stuffed Android

200 Brochures

20 Pressed 10.10 CDs
