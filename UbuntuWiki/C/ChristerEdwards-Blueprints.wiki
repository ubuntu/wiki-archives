__TOC__

This page will contain blueprints for projects created by ChristerEdwards

== Diet Tracker ==

This project would help track a users diet, possibly allowing the user to find common (unhealthy?) foods and improvements in their diet.  Not only tracking caloric intake but also ingredients populate a tag-cloud for a real insight into what is common in the diet.

=== Storage ===
xml storage backend (current in shrinkingman).

=== Presentation ===
GTK based interface offering a calendar with food + ingredient input.  Tracking calories daily, plus additional ingredient tracking.

I imagine a user could easily track the regularity of certain types via a tag-cloud style presentation.  Eat big macs everyday and the cloud will be overrun with such.

=== Input ===
Desktop
