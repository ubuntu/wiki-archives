== Actual Status ==

Ubuntu Colombia is growing faster, and Ubuntu in Colombia is expanding their influence everyday. Now, we are a great community with big goals and wishes.

On this years Ubuntu Colombia and his directives had been changing to respond to the different challenges that we confront. Many people has been integrated to our works and helping us to keep working for and with Ubuntu.

We want to broadcast the Ubuntu Philosophy and Ubuntu Operative System across our country, we have many obstacles but the people around Ubuntu Colombia is a memorable group of activist and passionated for Ubuntu and Free Software.

This are some of our big changes and projects in the last 2 years:

=== Participation on Ubuntu official media and co-work with regional LoCo teams ===

Ubuntu Colombia has been always a community focused on events, projects and collaboration. But one of our big goals was to collaborate with other LoCo Teams and regional/global events and show this on the official Ubuntu channels besides the work inside of our country.

Our participation with another Teams is growing and now we are one of the most collaborative Teams in different global/regional events (GBJ, UGJ, Ubuntu User Day, Ubuntu Open Week)

And, additional to this, we are using now the official channels to spread or work to world, on Planet Ubuntu (thanks to <nowiki>[[HollmanEnciso|Hollman Enciso]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[ingforigua|Diego Forigua]]</nowiki> ) and in the Ubuntu LoCo Teams Monthly Reports (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ColombianTeam/TeamReports/).

== Old plans and commitments ==

According to the <nowiki>[[ColombianTeam-ApprovalApplication|Approval Aplication]]</nowiki> and the <nowiki>[[http://irclogs.ubuntu.com/2008/02/21/%23ubuntu-meeting.html|log from the approval]]</nowiki> of Ubuntu Colombia as an Official LoCo Team, we had some projects, goals and compromises. This are some of them:

=== Karma Table ===

We've got some participation on karma activities at Launchpad, this is our actual status

<nowiki>[[File:uco-karmatable.png]]</nowiki>

=== Mailing list archive ===

Two years ago we had 281 members in our <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-co|mailiing list]]</nowiki>, now we have 939 members!!! 

According to the <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-co/|mailing list archive]]</nowiki>, this is the amount in size of the list.
Note: The mailing list of Ubuntu Colombia doesn't accept emails in html format or files.

<nowiki>[[File:ubuntuco-mailarchive.png]]</nowiki>

We can see 2 special behaviors:
1. The mailing list in the months of October, November an December of 2008 was very active, that, probably was because of the organization of the UbuCon Colombia 2008, one event held only by Ubuntu Colombia, with many responsibilities and coordination.

1. The size of the mailing list is decreasing in the last months, this maybe could be explain by the moderation to every message on the list. Almost every message is approved or declined by the 4 moderators of the mailing list.

=== Website visitors ===

Our website is wearing a new design after 2 years of use the old Ubuntu theme. Our website is the main point of contact with the community and users in general.

Now, we have 1.992 members registered in our website. Normally, we have 70 visits per day, the majority from Colombia.

<nowiki>[[File:ubuntuco-website.png]]</nowiki>

== Photographic Record ==

<nowiki>[[http://picasaweb.google.es/noticias.ubuntu.colombia|Photographs]]</nowiki>: 39 photo albums in different events!!

<nowiki>[[http://www.youtube.com/ubuntucolombia|Videos]]</nowiki>: Many videos, even with Jon "maddog" Hall :)

== New plans, goals and milestones ==

 {*} Keep working with the projects and organize a better system relationship with the leaders.
