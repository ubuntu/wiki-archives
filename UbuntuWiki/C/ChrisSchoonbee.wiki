=== Before Ubuntu ===
In 2000 I stumbled across Linux and the Free Software philosophy/movement on the internet. It was an epiphany.  Moving over from Windows to Linux was a slow affair.

=== My Journey into Ubuntu ===
==== April 2007 ====
Set up a Launchpad account.
I got involved in an ad-hoc manner - lurking on mailing lists, reported a couple of bugs.
==== September 2008 ====
Joined the South African Ubuntu team

==== December 2008 ====
Decided to commit the time needed to get more involved with the Ubuntu community.
Also to make my involvement more formal.
