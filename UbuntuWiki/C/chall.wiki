__TOC__

Eventually I'll get free time to work on this WIKI page....but that will probably be when there's 48 hours in a day :)

I'm Curtis Hall...I'm 28 at the time of this writing ().  I work for Bluecherry and I float between both divisions (Retail security (Linux) equipment sales and the software development side).  I'm not a programmer by nature.  I can look at PHP and some C++ and understand the general idea but I'm not one to sit down and punch out a thousand lines of code a day (blame ADD).  In the retail division I'm in sales and support and on the development side I generally consider myself the non-developer project leader.  I provide the rough roadmap and the suggestions on making sure the software is where we need it and the developers have what they need to make things awesome.  

I've been using Linux since 1996.  I started with Slackware and migrated to Debian / Ubuntu in 1999ish.
