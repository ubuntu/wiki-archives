== Setting The Stage ==
Our previous Support Saturdays were, in a word, '''amazing'''. Let's keep up the momentum.

Ubuntu Vancouver uses SupportSaturday to spread Ubuntu all across the city. We show people that great software is made better with great community. People come for help and leave feeling the Ubuntu spirit. Problems solved with a friendly smile. People come for demos and information and leave feeling enthusiastic about Ubuntu!

The goal for SupportSaturday #4 is to '''strengthen our technical team processes and capabilities'''. We will focus on providing superb technical support to our members, ensuring that they have the best possible Ubuntu experience.  This will position us to offer higher quality help to more people as we expand over the coming months. This will ensure that every member of Ubuntu Vancouver is in a position to advocate rather than to talk about what doesn't work for them.

Speaking of capabilities, we now have a mailing list for support.heroes and are planning regular tech meetings too. More to come on that...

Cheers,<<BR>>

=== Venue ===

The main venue location is Room G219 in Building B of the VCC Broadway Campus (1155 East Broadway).  Building B is the brand new building on campus that faces the north parking lot (on 7th). For those who drive to the campus and park in the lot, just walk through the front entrance and go past the Bookstore and elevators to the back end of the building. G219 is just to the left.

For those who enter the campus from Broadway, please walk all the way to Building B and go to the ground floor of the building. Turn to the back of the building and find G220. Note that the VCC main doors on Broadway Ave are sometimes locked on weekends, '''and you might have to walk down to 7th Ave. entrance to get in.'''

The VCC website has a map of the campus location:
http://www.vcc.ca/about-vcc/contact-us.cfm

==== Proposed Flow: ====
Upon arrival, attendees will sign-in. If they are a member of Ubuntu Vancouver, sign-in will be a simple name/email on the clipboard. Attendees coming for help will be briefly interviewed by a "triage" person and the output of that will be a "Support Request" (same forms as last time). <<BR>>
"Support Requests" will be posted on the bulletin board and managed by the triage/registration crew. In the event that a Support Hero/ine is available s/he will grab a "Support Request" that looks promising and get the person needing help.

=== Registration Room === 
G219. All Signage will point to this room. Staged for greeting people coming in for support. A friendly registration person will greet arrivals, interact with the triage specialist, and manage the event. For this session only, a part of this room will be configured for the Bug Squish. Normally this room is for demos and marketing functions.

=== Tech Room === 
G220. Staged for technical support, and staffed with tech support people to do installations, configurations, troubleshooting, etc. A room, more conducive to thinking and concentration. Lots of power, equipment, tools, and big brains. No marketing hype. Sign on the door that says "Register First. Tech issues only"

The room is a classroom with a reconfigurable table setup. The size is 9m x 6m (roughly estimated, and roughly the same size as the G219). It has:
* chairs for min. 20-25 people,
* around 9 to 10 tables (each big enough for 4 chairs and a workstation),
* '''NO LCD projector or AV equipment'''
* 2x2 power points are on the left and right side of the room in a distance of ~2m,
* One ethernet RJ-45 wall plug that does not work on w/e. However the room is expected to have wireless internet access using a captive portal. Randall and Stefan have the wifi login info. KK will try to set-up the server with two network interfaces and establish wired/wireless routing. (KK can you comment on whether this is done?
* whiteboards, corkboards

=== ToDo ===
* (./) Find volunteers in ubuntu-vancouver - RR, ST
* (./) Marketing: meetup.com posting, description, venue, RSVP questions - RR
* (needs owner) Create order of events (checklist/flight-check)
* Gather needed equipment (identify who will supply) We may be able to borrow some from Free Geek.

=== Lessons Learned ===
Please document any lessons learned from prior support events (e.g. Windowless Wednesdays, install-fests, etc.). We'll use that information to make SupportSaturdays stronger. No need to repeat mistakes.
'''Please refer to our "Lessons Learned" page for the list.'''

=== Event Marketing ===
We have essentially two things going on at the session:
1) Tech Support and installation
2) One-on-one demos (mini-booth style)

The thrust will be to get as many people as possible in the Ubuntu Vancouver Loco signed up for the event (in the spirit of '''fixing our own group''' and making it stronger so we can help more people at future events). Randall will email the group at least 3-4 times to encourage everyone to come and get their issues fixed. Scheduled mailings: xx/02, xx/02, xx/02.<<BR>>

=== Terminology: ===
'''SupportHero''': A volunteer who is attending the event to offer technical assistance or to provide marketing support, or general organizational event support and has been part of the planning process.<<BR>>
'''Requestor''': A person that has RSVP'd "yes" for the event and has indicated that they need assistance.<<BR>>
'''Drop-In''': A person that saw our poster and just showed up, or was "dragged in" shown in or flagged down.

=== Suggested Help Procedure (pre-event) ===

1) "SupportHero" reaches out to Requestor via email, acknowledging the request and asking the Requestor to quickly scan a list of bug reports, if applicable. Outreach targets are documented in the table below. See: Issues Reported at bottom of this page.<<BR>>
2) Requestor responds with more info. This could be a bug number, or more descriptive information about the issue.<<BR>>
3) "SupportHero" asks Requestor if s/he would be comfortable filing a Launchpad Question. If so, Requestor submits question to: ____ If so, skip to step 5. If not, skip to step 4 below.<<BR>>
4) "Support Hero" submits a Launchpad Question describing the issue on Requestor's behalf.<<BR>>
5) "Support Hero" monitors Launchpad responses to question, and conducts further research.<<BR>>

=== Suggested Help Procedure (at event) ===
* Refer to the main <nowiki>[[CanadianTeam-Vancouver-SupportSaturdays|SupportSaturdays]]</nowiki> page. Stefan has some '''great''' ideas documented there on how to maintain flow, and how to match the best help to each situation.
