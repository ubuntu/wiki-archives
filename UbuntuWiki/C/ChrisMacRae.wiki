'''__General Information__'''

My name is Chris MacRae and I have been using Ubuntu for the past 6 months and I have to say that I am impressed. I have decided to contribute to the community in any way I can as I have had lots of help in the past. I live in Lloydminster, AB and look forward to meeting other Canadian linux users. I hope to promote the use of open source software including Ubuntu in and around my community.

'''__Volunteer Work__'''

I am a proud member of the UFCW Local 401 and I hope to show my union the benefits of free open source software.
