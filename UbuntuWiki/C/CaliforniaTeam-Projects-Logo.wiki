* Not sure if I like the "California Ubuntu" or if "Ubuntu California" would be better.  Also, question about what font to use for Ubuntu.
* I think that "Ubuntu California" is a bit more traditional sounding, as the Ubuntu should be first. What are the rules about using the Ubuntu font again?

* Here's what I was thinking with the Ubuntu-California design.  I'm not sure which looks better.  I think they lose something in the thumbnails (too subtle) but for our team icon (on Launchpad) we could simply use the California outline by itself.
* Different sizes plus SVGs available here: http://www.nhaines.com/ubuntu-california-logos/
