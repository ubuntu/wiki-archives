=== Introduction ===
This page is a place for the Ubuntu community to collaborate on ideas for Ubuntu 7.10 (Gutsy Gibbon). It is adapted from the <nowiki>[[CommunityFeistyIdeas]]</nowiki> page for the 7.04 release (Feisty Fawn).

Mark Shuttleworth announced the name of the next release and some of the priorities for this release on the ubuntu-devel-announce list. That message can be see here: https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel-announce/2007-April/000276.html

This page is intended for the community. Ideas should be added, but unless they are outrageous, illegal etc (i.e. cannot be implemented) they should not be removed.

As this page grows it will most likely need to be turned into a list of links to separate pages.

=== Goals ===

According to Mark Shuttleworth's announcement, the priorities for this release include:

* Unattended Installation
* Composite-by-default

=== Ideas ===

Review what is on the [CommunityFeistyIdeas] page. Some of those ideas have already been implemented. If they have not been, and you're interested in them happening in Gutsy, then please move them here.

=== Getting from Ideas to Specs ===

If you go to https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+specs you  will see a list of many desired feature specs for Ubuntu. They are given different priorities. 

We should translate the CommunityGutsyIdeas into specs to ensure that they are considered for Gutsy Gibbon. At the bottom of each Ideas page, please indicate if an idea being discussed has already been posted as a spec. If there is an idea that you want to get posted as a spec, you can either submit it yourself or start drafting it at the bottom of the Ideas page.

The specs often have other wiki pages linked. For instance <nowiki>[[https://features.launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+spec/home-user-backup|home-user-backup]]</nowiki> links to https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HomeUserBackup. As the ideas get developed, we should start to turn the discussions into  proposals. This means creating the spec, but it also means creating a page on the wiki that presents a reasonably detailed proposal for each idea. 

The more we turn these ideas into actionable items, the more likely they will be implemented. Let's make Gutsy Gibbon the most community-driven release yet!
