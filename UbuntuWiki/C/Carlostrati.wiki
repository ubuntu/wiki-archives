=== Who I am ===

My name is Carlo, I'm a freelance and ICT consultant working for several magazines and websites. I'm author of some books about digital lifestyle (photo, home networking, wirless comm). For more details about my job experience, please look at my wiki page on <nowiki>[[http://wiki.ubuntu-it.org/CarloStrati|Ubuntu-it]]</nowiki>.

=== My interest in Ubuntu ===

For years I've been using several Linux distributions both on my desktops and servers, but I think that Ubuntu for the first time has made real the idea of free software. I like it, I use it and I tell my friends to use it. That's why give my support to the Ubuntu project and community.
