This page is a list of projects that need doing on the CaliforniaTeam wiki pages and elsewhere on the web. If you've found something that needs doing that isn't on here, please write a note about it here so someone can step up and do it. If you'd like to work on an item, add your name in the "Volunteer" field, so we don't step on each other's toes (and so other people can collaborate with you).  Also, feel free to split items into smaller pieces.

|-
| <(>Lots of the pages for individual projects need updating with pictures and information about what happened at the event. We do an awesome job of showing how we planned events, but it would be good to also show how the event turned out, so people can browse through and look at events, and so that we have a repository of information that might be useful in the future. The <nowiki>[[CaliforniaTeam-ApprovalApplication|approval app]]</nowiki> might be useful for this, as it has links to relevant meetings and other useful stuff.

|-
| <(>I am willing to do some wiki editing. I need some input on which of this is straight forward & which needs more thought. The general idea is to make the wiki easier to use. Consolidate items that are spread out. Find what we can merge. Let's '''ask''' people outside of the developer community for their input. The more approachable we make it - the better. Suggestions should be sent to ML.
