== Whoami ==

Central place for all my personal pointers: http://www.google.com/profiles/cmuller13
(LinkedIn, Picasaweb, blog, etc.)

I am a french research engineer working at Gemalto, a smart card manufacturer.
I have been working on a Java framework for using Smart Cards named Open Card Framework (OCF), see the web site I have set-up for more details: http://www.gemplus.com/techno/opencard/.
I am now involved in prototyping the next generation Java cards (Java Card 3.0). Some of my interests include Tcl and are detailed (not very much) in my Advogato Personal info page: http://advogato.org/person/cmuller/. In the near (?) future, I intend to develop this page with pointers on tips for using Ubuntu with photography: http://cmuller13.googlepages.com/

== Ubuntu ==

I am using (K)Ubuntu 9.04 (Jaunty) on a Dell D830.

Thanks all teams for a wonderfully stable yet up-to-date distrib. And of course thanks to all debian developers as well.
