=== Ubuntu Colombia Re-approval ===

Ubuntu Colombia is one of the most traditional LoCo Teams within the regional and global communities, specially within the Spanish language ones. As Ubuntu Colombia is conscious about the importance to keep being recognized as an active and official LoCo Team, we've created this Wiki page to summarize the main activities that we've done during the last three years. We know that we have lost approval a couple of years ago, but we have still remained active and operational in our country and wish to have LoCoTeam reapproved again.

==== Council ====

Ubuntu Colombia is being administered by the council, composed by official community members.  Within its tasks, it should help fulfilling the community's interests in general, serve as support for different activities and events held all over the country, look for a harmony and orderly development in the community growth and help in establishing cooperation agreements between different LoCo Teams and communities within Colombia and other countries, within other several tasks.

We have a strong team for this new administration that will take care of the future of the community.
