__TOC__

since xlibs 6.8.2-66 the package description it says 
<code>If you are running Breezy already, you may safely remove this package.</code>

The only problem is, there are quite a lot of packages still depending on it.

This is the output of: <code>grep-dctrl -FDepends xlibs < /var/lib/apt/lists/archive.ubuntu.com_ubuntu_dists_breezy_main_binary-i386_Packages | grep-dctrl --not -FDepends libx11-6 -s Package</code>

The command isn't quite accurate, since <code>xlibs | libx11-6</code> would be acceptable, but some packages might have <code>xlibs, libx11-6</code> in their <code>Depends:</code> line. 

Let's make the transition happen.

Here's the list (these are obviously wrong):
