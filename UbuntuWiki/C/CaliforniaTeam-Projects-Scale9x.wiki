Welcome to the page for Ubuntu California Team participation in the 9th
<nowiki>[[http://socallinuxexpo.org/scale9x/|Southern California Linux Expo]]</nowiki>, aka SCaLE9x.  SCaLE9x is February 25-27, 2011 (Fri-Sun)!

Get 50% off of registration for SCaLE9x with the Ubuntu California Team promo code "UBUCA".  This code can be used by anybody, so feel free to let your friends, family, and co-workers know about the great deal.

See <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CaliforniaTeam/Projects/Scale8x|Last Year's SCaLE Page]]</nowiki> for reference.

== Booth ==

=== Materials ===
If you think of anything else (large or small) we need, please add it to the list.  If the reason it is needed/wanted isn't obvious, explain the reasoning in the description area.  This should be an all encompassing list, from duct tape to computers to scratch paper.  When in doubt, add it and mention you're unsure in the description.

If you can provide something, please sign your name in the volunteer column (more than one person per item is fine).  If you have anything else to say about it (like, "I'm 60% sure I have one of these") use the comments field.  If you're providing a part of something (a computer but no monitor) make sure you mention that as well.

If you can't figure out the wiki formatting, just add items/comments underneath, and someone else will come wikify it.

Feel free to make any comments/suggestions/additions!
