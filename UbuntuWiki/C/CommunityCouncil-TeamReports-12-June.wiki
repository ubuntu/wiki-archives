** Catch up with Forums Council
** Greatest concern is that they still having hardware issues, spammers, and anxiously awaiting upgrade
*** Outstanding ticket 16733 which details the process with Canonical IS so far
*** Upgrade to v4 is blocked by continued SSO (single sign in) issues
*** Spam prevention software requires v4
*** When asked how much time is spent on handling spam now:
*** Iowan: It's what I do most of he time - and I miss 75%
*** coffeecat: I personally spent 2-4 hours per day for 14 days finding and banning toxic email domains.
*** dholbach suggested liaising with the folks in #canonical-sysadmin directly to move things forward
*** CC to review the ticket and see if there is any way they can help
*** The question of whether SSO is really required for the v4 upgrade, will follow up with sabdfl
** Most sections of forums continue to be busy
** No current issues with dispute resolution or similar
** Continue to have contributors who are applying to become Ubuntu Members
** IRC Council Poll closes today, once it's closed the CC will review the poll and make an announcement to the IRC folks about their new council member
** CoC review is ongoing, CC needs to define what still needs to be reviewed
