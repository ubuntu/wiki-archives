Hello,

I am Chadders, and the proud owner of an ASUS F3JP laptop. If you have any queries about the ASUS F3JP don't hesitate to contact me through a PM on Ubuntu Forums or Linux Forums.

My support in Linux is mostly Debian and Debian derivatives (such as Ubuntu) orientated. Recently I have looked a little bit into RPM based distributions in order to obtain a more rounded perspective on the Linux community.
