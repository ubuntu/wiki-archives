[03:00] <pleia2> ==== START ====
[03:00] <iheartubuntu> :)
[03:00] <pleia2> Agenda: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CaliforniaTeam/Meetings/11March27
[03:01] <philipballew> quite the big agenda!
[03:01] <pleia2> TOPIC: Ubuntu Global Jam Parties
[03:01] <pleia2> so the Global Jam is next weekend, Apr 1-3
[03:01] <pleia2> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuGlobalJam
[03:02] <pleia2> our wiki page for it is here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CaliforniaTeam/Projects/NattyGlobalJam
[03:02] <pleia2> as you can see we have 2 events planned, one in Walnut Creek on Friday and another in Berkeley on Sunday
[03:02] <pleia2> more are welcome :)
[03:02] <DarkwingDuck> These on the loco directory yet?
[03:02] <dragon> o/
[03:03] <pleia2> yes, the links are on the wiki
[03:03] <DarkwingDuck> are they all inclusive or, are they topical jams?
[03:04]  * eps giggles
[03:04] <pleia2> the one in Walnut Creek is all inclusive, jono's email about it is here: https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-us-ca/2011-March/001640.html
[03:04] <dragon> o.O
[03:04] <DarkwingDuck> Roger
[03:04] <dragon> We have a meeting, right?
[03:04] <pleia2> for the Berkeley one I put on the wiki: Focus: Testing and Bugs
[03:04] <DarkwingDuck> We are in the meeting now dragon
[03:05] <pleia2> dragon: this is the meeting :)
[03:05] <aaditya> Oh, no wonder.
[03:05] <iheartubuntu> :)
[03:05] <aaditya> I see no messages on my pidgin.
[03:05] <DarkwingDuck> ?
[03:05] <pleia2> but even at the Berkeley one we can do other stuff too
[03:06] <pleia2> DarkwingDuck: were you going to do a virtual doc jam?
[03:06] <DarkwingDuck> I'm still thinking about setting one up online but, it all depends how much crunch work I have.
[03:06]  * pleia2 nods
[03:07] <DarkwingDuck> But yes. I'll post date and time on the ML
[03:07] <pleia2> cool, thanks :)
[03:07] <DarkwingDuck> One of my doc gurus got his lappy stolen
[03:07] <DarkwingDuck> So crunch time +1
[03:08] <pleia2> oh, and I mailed the list about it this morning, but in case you're interested in running one but are not sure how, there is an event in #ubuntu-classroom tomorrow geared toward getting everyone ready: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuGlobalJamBootcamp
[03:08] <pleia2> yeah, poor nixternal :(
[03:08] <DarkwingDuck> Yeah... I called him last night... still no luch
[03:08] <DarkwingDuck> *luck
[03:09] <pleia2> ok, any thing else about the Jams?
[03:09] <DarkwingDuck> Lets get good quality work out there...
[03:10] <DarkwingDuck> These Jams help us Devs more then people know.
[03:10] <DarkwingDuck> ESP Unity
[03:10] <DarkwingDuck> Unity needs some major TLC
[03:10]  * DarkwingDuck gets off his soapbox
[03:10] <pleia2> :)
[03:12] <pleia2> TOPIC: Announcements, other things
[03:12] <pleia2> anyone have any bright ideas? comments? rants?
[03:12] <DarkwingDuck> Unity needs testors and bug reporting
[03:12] <DarkwingDuck> :P
[03:13] <philipballew> whats the best way to do that?
[03:13] <philipballew> do i need to actually install 11.04 or can i report bugs from my vbox machine just fine?
[03:13] <DarkwingDuck> Download and install a daily live CD http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-live/current/
[03:13] <pleia2> only if vbox supports accelerated graphics for your card
[03:14] <DarkwingDuck> vbox will not give you the Unity 3D
[03:14] <philipballew> hum. i can partition this week then
[03:14] <pleia2> there is an experimental thing to enable 3d in vbox, but it hardly works for anyone :\
[03:15] <pleia2> this is one of the many reasons they need more testers, it's harder to do testing because you pretty much have to do it on actual hardware
[03:15] <DarkwingDuck> Here are the list of bugs
[03:15] <DarkwingDuck> https://bugs.launchpad.net/unity
[03:15] <eps> DarkwingDuck: I was expecting we'd be working from Beta 1
[03:15] <pleia2> the beta 1 or the daily build
[03:15] <pleia2> (beta1 comes out on the 31st)
[03:16] <DarkwingDuck> Here are the list of new bugs. https://bugs.launchpad.net/unity/+bugs?search=Search&field.status=New
[03:16] <DarkwingDuck> Replicate and confirm the bugs is a good start.
[03:16] <philipballew> gotta build that karma somehow
[03:17] <DarkwingDuck> This is a simple way to help with Unity
[03:19]  * eps would really like to see how viable Natty is on machines with older, less-capable video hardware
[03:19] <philipballew> unity is gonna be interesting. should see what happens
[03:19] <DarkwingDuck> :)
[03:19] <pleia2> ok, anything else?
[03:20] <pleia2> eps: if Unity doesn't work for some reason it falls back to regular gnome (it did this flawlessly on my VM), so I wouldn't worry too much
[03:21] <pleia2> alright, I think we can wrap this up then :)
[03:21] <pleia2> thanks everyone
