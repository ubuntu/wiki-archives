== About Me ==

I am a 29 years old currently living in <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York|New York, United States]]</nowiki>. I have been with Ubuntu off and on the last few years "trying" it out. I '''*officially*'''  agreed to myself to never run/own Windows again personally this year. I've been working with computers since the mid 1990's and I've been hooked ever since. I have learned quite a bit about Website Design, Graphic Design, Ad Layout and a whole lot more. I am slowly getting back into doing some Artwork using Gimp and Inkscape. It is my pleasure to be a part of the growing number of ubuntu users.
