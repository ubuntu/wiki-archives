dscassel: Okay. I'll bring up the agenda... 

egerlach reports for duty. 

dscassel: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CanadianTeam/Meetings/2010-07-18 

egerlach: Burgundavia: Typically you can type "/names" to find out who
is on a channel. 

Burgundavia: yes, I know 

Burgundavia: haven't been on irc in a long time 

dscassel: Okay. Well, introductions... I'm Darcy, and I guess I'm
chairing this thing. 

dscassel: I'm in Waterloo, btw. 

dscassel: (Okay, Kitchener at the moment) 

dscassel: Burgundavia is the official contact for the LoCo. It's good to
see you out. 

egerlach: I'm Eric, #kwartzlab denizen and in K-W as well. 

dscassel: Okay, so re-approvals. 

BobJonkman: Are we intro-ing? I'm Bob, slightly north of Kitchener.
Ubuntu enthusiast... 

dscassel: Apparently it's not an issue until next year. Which is good,
'cuz I'd have a hard time talking about what we'd say. 

dscassel: Hi Bob. :) 

hypatia: what do we need to do for that? 

egerlach: dscassel: re-approval isn't an issue until next year? 

dscassel: We have to demonstrate all the LoCo-ish things we do. 

johanbr: I'm Johan, in Halifax, long-time Ubuntu user, but not really
formally involved in any ubuntu activities 

Burgundavia: I am the official contact merely because I have always
been, but my involvement with Ubuntu has been kind of non-existant
recently so I would love somebody to take over the job 

dscassel: Hi johanbr :D 

johanbr: hi :) 

dscassel: I think txwikinger3 would like to take the mantle, if we can
get him out to a meeting. ^_^; 

dscassel: So for reapproval next year, we just have to do things between
now and then. 

dscassel: Release parties, Jams, hours and events. 

egerlach: dscassel: And report them in our team reports? 

dscassel: egerlach: Yeah. 

hypatia: we had a release party for 10.04 in toronto 

dscassel: Also, we need to maintain the website, IRC, mailing list and
forum (since people seem to want one) 

dscassel: hypatia, excellent. :D 

dscassel: We'll have to keep better track of these things. 

dscassel: Do you have pictures? 

dscassel: Anybody blog about it? 

Burgundavia: the challenge currently is that the website is accessed by
very few, is quite locked down and is in Drupal to boot 

Burgundavia: ideally we would like to switch over to Wordpress,
something Canonical has been talking about/doing for a while now 

dscassel: Yeah. txwikinger3 has a server set up on his VPS. It's drupal,
but he does drupal hosting. 

Burgundavia: then we can tie the login to the ubuntu-ca-membership group
so any ubuntu member could post 

dscassel: Which probably means I ought to get off my butt and apply for
membership, 'cuz I'm not one. 

Burgundavia:
https://code.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-website-community/ubuntu-
website/light-wordpress-theme 

johanbr: I'm also tangentially involved in the Swedish loco, and they
ended up getting their own hosting 

hypatia: you can join the ubuntu-ca group without full membership,
though, right? 

johanbr: mostly because getting Canonical to make any changes was a very
slow process 

dscassel: johanbr: Yeah. That's been the consensus here. 

egerlach: We should be able to integrate Drupal and Wordpress, though.
They're both flexible enough. 

Burgundavia: yes, the -ca group is for everybody 

hypatia: integrating wp and drupal just means we need to maintain both
:p 

egerlach: Not necessarily... it just sounds like there's some sort of
auth thing we could tie into. I'm sure we could get Drupal to tie into
that. Burgundavia, can you elaborate? Am I understanding the issue
correctly? 

Burgundavia: I need to look into it more 

dscassel: Our main problem is we're having a hard enough time convincing
anyone to do anything. 

Burgundavia: I know the fridge has a drupal connector installed but I
don't know the process that went through and given the Fridge is about
to switch to wordpress... 

dscassel: So we don't need complexity. 

Burgundavia: I have just emailed Amber Graner to ask her about the
fridge wordpress move 

Burgundavia: well, tbh, creating another login is a headache and another
barrier 

Burgundavia: the wordpress connector uses OpenID and connects to LP.net
that way 

Burgundavia: anyway, beyond the webs 

dscassel: If someone wants to look into that... 

Burgundavia: I agree that the issue getting people to do things 

dscassel: Yeah. 

dscassel: :) 

Burgundavia: let's wait and see what Amber says 

dscassel: Okay. 

egerlach: Well, Drupal will do OpenID easy enough, but if there's a
Wordpress bundle ready to go, no reason not to use that. 

Burgundavia: I am really worried about hosting off Canonical for the
simple reason that people disappear 

Burgundavia: we have had it happen before and it will happen again 

egerlach: Burgundavia: Agreed. 

Burgundavia: almost none of the people that I started this team with 5
years ago are still here 

dscassel: True. But if txwikinger3 disappears, the URL can be redirected
back to Canonical or wherever else. 

Burgundavia: and we could lose the content 

dscassel: I'd be all for Canonical hosting if it wasn't such a pain in
the butt. 

Burgundavia: amber just emailed me back 

Burgundavia: said they are moving forward using non-Canonical site 

dscassel: Me, I just want a website that works now. And looks pretty.
Content can be lost lots of ways. 

dscassel: Seems to be a common theme. :) 

hypatia: we can have the site send backups to multiple people 

hypatia: so if the person running the site goes awol, we just re- set it
up elsewhere 

BobJonkman: Some other Ubuntu-ca members could download or hold backups
of the site; if txwikinger3 disappears one of them can restore the site 

hypatia: re wp+drupal, i meant more that that's two systems to keep
patched 

BobJonkman: :) 

hypatia: which is enough of a pain for one CMS, let alone two 

hypatia: in that respect, wp doesn't add much that drupal doesn't
already do 

dscassel: Wordpress has a nice db backup and email plugin. Dunno about
drupal. 

hypatia: drupal has native blogging and openid support 

BobJonkman: How about using a CVS to hold the content? Doesn't Launchpad
have something? 

Burgundavia: wordpress has major marketshare and is fairly easy to use 

hypatia: BobJonkman: eww not 

hypatia: *no 

Burgundavia: drupal, not so much 

Burgundavia: akgraner is here from the UWN to talk about wordpress 

hypatia: i don't really care which we use 

hypatia: just not two systems 

dscassel: hypatia: I think BobJonkman meant to say "bzr" 

hypatia: that's just silly 

hypatia: also not a VCS 

hypatia: that's also a terrible idea :) 

hypatia: VCS != CMS, fundamentally 

BobJonkman: CVS as a generic acronym for any Content Versioning System,
not necesarily the one called CVS 

dscassel: Anyway! 

hypatia: which is why i said VCS not CVS, which is still a bad idea for
a website :) 

dscassel: Distributing database backups is a good idea. Agreed 

BobJonkman: (just had a Git presentation at our local Drupal group on
Thursday -- some people use Git for everything) 

Burgundavia: yes, but they are not easy to use 

hypatia: some people use emacs for everything. doesn't make it a good
general solution. 

Burgundavia: we want really easy to use so that people don't have that
argument to use 

egerlach: Warning! Incoming tangent! 

dscassel: Okay, so let's get back on track. 

hypatia: dscassel: good plan 

egerlach: We need to record what we do, right? 

dscassel: We have a Drupal set up, almost ready to go. txwikinger3 has
the status on that. 

Burgundavia: dscassel: akgraner is willing to give us a rundown on the
Ubuntu Weekly News/Fridge and what they are doing with WP 

dscassel: Burgundavia: I'd be interested in that. I think Ralph's plan
is to stick with Drupal. But I'm open to alternatives. 

akgraner: Hi all... 

dscassel: Hi akgraner :) 

dscassel: We hear you're using Wordpress for the Fridge. 

akgraner: we will be in about 3 weeks 

akgraner: we were waiting to see what Canonical was going to do but well
they got a little busy and all that 

dscassel: We're having problems with Canonical's drupal hosting, and
we're transitioning to our own drupal server. But Wordpress has been
brought up as an alternative. 

akgraner: so we are building it out on a non-canonical server and will
run the fridge and the WP new one together for a few weeks to make sure
we are meeting the needs of the community 

akgraner: if you look at - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Website/WebThemes 

akgraner: and go The Fridge section you'll see what we are going to be
doing with it 

dscassel: The Fridge is pretty blog-like, so I'm guessing Wordpress
makes sense there... 

dscassel: http://ubuntu.kuzeko.com/ That's rather pretty. 

Burgundavia: yes is is 

Burgundavia: it is, rather 

akgraner: well we want to get away from the blog like feel 

akgraner: we want it to have a more news like feel 

akgraner: and wp is easy for everyone to use 

akgraner: they don't have to know html or anything to add content 

dscassel: Are you going to be migrating old content over? 

akgraner: we talked about that - and it's a huge undertaking - and
something Canonical would have to do for us 

akgraner: b/c the there are no community people left with admin to even
do the migration (or so I am told) 

hypatia: ouch 

akgraner: even I can't change the look to the front of the Fridge 

akgraner: hypatia, yeah it's a but painful at times :-) 

hypatia: :s 

akgraner: s/but/bit 

dscassel: It's reassuring (?) it's not just us. :) 

Burgundavia: the fridge has a huge amount of content 

akgraner: so rather than wait for someone build it out - we decided to
just add the openid function to the WP site 

Burgundavia: how does that work with a specific LP team? 

akgraner: well not sure - I know we will just add the admin/editors
based on the LP team 

akgraner: it will be a manual process for that at the moment 

dscassel: Okay. 

akgraner: but anyone who has an open id can sign to add stuff but the
content will be reviewed by editors before it's posted to the world 

Burgundavia: ah, ok 

akgraner: so we will give the Fridge Editors access based on their level
of access in LP 

akgraner: make sense it won't be tied to LP b/c if it was then it would
be housed on a Canonical Server 

akgraner: well won't be tied to SSO 

akgraner: at least in the beginning 

akgraner: and no it is not just you all that has troubles with getting
stuff done on a Canonical hosted server 

dscassel: I'm okay with setting up permissions manually. 

dscassel: We aren't dealing with that many people here. 

akgraner: did I answer all your questions? or is there anything else I
didn't answer? 

dscassel: I can't think of anything else, myself... 

dscassel: Thanks, akgraner. Looking forward to the new Fridge. :) 

akgraner: dscassel, thanks! So am I - :-) 

dscassel: Okay! So, that covers the web site for now. I'll prod
txwikinger3 (again) for an update. 

dscassel: Monthly reports! 

dscassel: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TeamReports 

dscassel: I'll be taking up doing them, officially. But if you do
something during the month, feel free to add it to the page. 

dscassel: I'll remind people on the ML. 

egerlach: So we're allowed to add directly to the main Team Reports
page? 

dscassel: Anybody with a launchpad account, I think. 

dscassel: It's just a wiki. 

Burgundavia: yes and yes 

dscassel: And, do we have events? 

egerlach: Just making sure it's within etiquette for anyone to do it. 

dscassel: I'll be starting an Ubuntu Hour in Waterloo before the end of
the month. 

dscassel: So I'll have that to report, at least. 

egerlach: I'm going to be beta-testing an Ubuntu LAN Party idea of mine
in early August. Hoping to expand it after that. 

hypatia: if i follow through on my plan to go back to school full time
in the fall, i'd like to do a Toronto Ubuntu Hour 

dscassel: egerlach, hypatia, awesome. :D 

dscassel: If that's all, we should probably wrap it up. 

dscassel: Happy Ubuntuing all! 

Burgundavia: thanks dscassel for getting this going 

dscassel: We'll meet back here in a month. 

dscassel: Burgundavia: glad to breathe some life back into this thing.
:) 

dscassel: Burgundavia: question... 

dscassel: Have you done much with Ubuntu Vancouver? 

dscassel: I wanna find out if any of them are up for helping out. 

Burgundavia: dscassel: not much, despite living in Victoria 

dscassel: I figure if they've got 300 people or whatever, a couple of
them might be interested in heping update a website occasionally. :) 

dscassel: I'll keep pestering Randall, I guess... 

Elwillow: reporting in (totally an hour late) 

dscassel: Hi Elwillow. We're done. 

dscassel: Most of us are still in the channel, though. :) 

Elwillow: I assumed so. 

Elwillow: I'll go over the history ;) 

dscassel: Elwillow: Doing anything interesting Ubuntu-wise that we can
put in the Month Report? 

dscassel: Er, monthly report. 

King_Arthur: I posted this
http://de-en.gc.ca/2010/05/20/government-use-and-participation-in-open-
source/ on Canada's goverment website 

King_Arthur: What I do is found at www.Amendt.net 

dscassel: Cool. Thanks, King_Arthur 

Elwillow: nothing much... 

dscassel: Elwillow: No worries. :) 

Elwillow: dscassel: I work with Ubuntu plenty but nothing public (all my
company server are running ubuntu). 

dscassel: Elwillow: Whereabouts are you? 

Elwillow: Gatineau-Ottawa. 

dscassel: Ah, cool. 

Elwillow: I live in Gatineau and work in ottawa. 

dscassel: There's an Ubuntu Hour out there occasionally. Do you know
those guys? 

Elwillow: nope. I learned about that today. I will attend the next one.
The pub is next to my place. 

Elwillow: (work place). 

dscassel: Convenient. :D 

dscassel: I get up to Ottawa once or twice a year. I'm thinking I should
try to make it out to one of those... 

Kulag: dscassel: I think I missed something. Are there meetings in
Ottawa? 

Elwillow: Kulag: The Ubuntu Hour. 

dscassel: Yeah Second Thursday of the month in the Exchange Pub.
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Hour 

dscassel: It's ZykoticK9 and John Gill. 

dscassel: Pretty informal. 

Elwillow: isn't it suppose to be informal? 

dscassel: Yeah. 

Elwillow: for a second I though it was suppose to be all plan and all. 

dscassel: Well, Kulag was asking about "meetings." This is more "meetup"

Kulag: I just realized there's a difference now that you say that.
