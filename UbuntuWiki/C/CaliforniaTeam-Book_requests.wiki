 - Practical C Programming, 3rd Edition http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9781565923065.do

 - C Pocket Reference http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596004361.do

(not really that interested in java or C++, but the ruby might be a little less verbose and therefore helpful, on the other hand this book is much shorter--while having more languages--so is probably far less comprehensive, then the one below it)
 - Algorithms in a Nutshell  http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596516246.do

 - Mastering Algorithms with C http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9781565924536.do

 - where is the chapter on SocketCAN? http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596809577.do

 - oh, this one covers CAN, (also RS-232, hopefully inc. simple stuff like SPST) here we go - http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596007553.do

 - not sure if I'll have the stomach for learning about such extremely powerful, yet domain-specific, software, http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596155988.do
