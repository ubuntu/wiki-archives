'''Customize Firefox for Computer Lab:''' 

'''Description:''' 
Firefox is the key application in my computer enabled classroom. Also, it is the key source of student distraction! There are few customizations that are most important:
* lock down  the following choices in preferences:
** The,'save files to' in the main tab
** May need to lock down add-ons-- but only if it becomes a problem
** The entire application tab
** The entire privacy tab so student cannot delete his or her history
** The entire advanced tab
** The entire security tab

'''Procedure:'''
* Here's a link to a Firefox 3 addon to do those things needed--http://www.kaply.com/weblog/2009/01/16/cck-wizard-12-finally-available/
** some detail
* Here's a link to a 'deployment utility' with instructions to use it: http://www.pcc-services.com/kixtart/firefox-lockdown.html
