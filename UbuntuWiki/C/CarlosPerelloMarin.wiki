I used to be a Launchpad developer working on Launchpad translations. My main tasks were to provide the translation infrastructure for Ubuntu and provide Martin Pitt with .po files to generate Ubuntu language packs.

You can see my <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~carlos|Launchpad account]]</nowiki> to know more about my work and my contributions.
