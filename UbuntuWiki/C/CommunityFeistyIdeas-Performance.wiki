How could OS performance and boot speed be further improved?

=== Boot Process ===

=== Performance ===

* I don't know what <nowiki>[[http://www.archlinux.org/|Arch Linux]]</nowiki> does to improve performance but please consider to use some of their techniques because it's '''so much''' faster than Ubuntu
* Use <nowiki>[[http://packages.ubuntulinux.org/feisty/admin/prelink|prelink]]</nowiki> by default like e.g. <nowiki>[[http://fedora.redhat.com/|Fedora]]</nowiki> does or offer it as an option after installation
* Build i686 optimized packages. Maybe a legacy version for Ubuntu with i386 builds would make sense
