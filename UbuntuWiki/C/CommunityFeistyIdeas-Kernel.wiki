==== Kernel stuff ====

* Enable <nowiki>[[http://people.redhat.com/~mingo/exec-shield/|exec-shield]]</nowiki> by default in order to increase system security (see also http://packages.debian.org/unstable/devel/kernel-patch-exec-shield).
 
* Read, Write NTFS drivers ( think this is best place for this )
* Use kernel 2.6.20 or higher, or at least include KVM patches. Features like Parallels for OSX would draw more users.
