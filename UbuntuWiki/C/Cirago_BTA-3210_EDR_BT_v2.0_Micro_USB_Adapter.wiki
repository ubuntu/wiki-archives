== Cirago BTA-3210 EDR BT v2.0 Micro USB Adapter ==

=== Product Information ===

USB bluetooth dongle that is small enough to keep plugged in without it getting in the way.  It only has a 10m (30 feet) range, so don't get it if you need it to work at a distance.  However, for connecting a cell phone or some other simple use, it works perfectly.

=== Compatibility ===

Works with Ubuntu 7.04 without any problems.
