__TOC__

I am a recent convert to Open Source software, and even more recently to free (as in beer and in speech) software, particularly the Ubuntu distribution of GNU/Linux. I appreciate the spirit of community and sharing that I find here.

I work for a public school district (Grades K-12) in Texas, USA.

---------

I am grateful for the sharing of Mark Shuttleworth (Ubuntu), Richard Stallman (FSF & GNU), Linus Torvalds (Linux kernal), Tim Berners-Lee (HTTP & W3C), and all their many unsung colleagues and contributors.
