| Glxgears and any other 3d apps (eg: google earth)come on the top of all the other windows, no matter if an other window covers them. So I can't say they are usable with desktop effects! Their opacity can't be changed either as well as with video playback with xv...

| Generally works beautifully, with great performance. On Feisty's version of Compiz, occasionally I hit a bug (more often on 64MB cards than 256MB ones) where a window would stop interacting. You could click buttons, and the window would respond to the mouse clicks, but you couldn't see it happening visually. I haven't encountered this bug on Gutsy yet.

| (1): Launchpad bug #141533, Session crash when playing video and switching to the other workspace in Compiz.   Aside from this, two minor annoyances: bug #145704, Same tooltip on both workspaces when using Compiz, and bug #145708, Flicker while bringing a window to the front with Compiz. *UPDATE* (28/09/2007): after today's Gutsy update, bug (1) is solved for me (see comments in it), i.e. playing video and switching workspaces no longer crashes X session, and both work. Updating to version 1:6.7.194-1ubuntu1 of xserver-xorg-video-ati does solves it. OOUH YEAAAH!!
| 02:00.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: ATI Technologies Inc M10 NQ [Radeon Mobility 9600] [1002:4e51]
| Same problems explained by Giovanni. Video card (from its box) is a Radeon 9600XT, AGP, 256MB memory, outputs: VGA, DVI and TV-out (in case it helps) *UPDATE* (28/09/2007) After bug #141533 got solved for me, columns Works and Video should be Yes (both work ok). Only issue remaining is glxgears. I want to add that Compiz runs very smoothly here, both with Normal and Extra effects.

| (1): (Major) bug #108527: Annoying random freeze within an hour, only power button helps. (2): Bug #141533 as Eduardo wrote above. (3): video remains stationary on drag, catches up on mouse stop. (4): Same as (3) for 3D apps, also rendered image residues remain in the old position of the window (i.e. not properly damaged on drag).

| This is on a Dell Inspiron 6000, 128 MB X300, with "ati" open source drivers, no Xgl. If (1) doesn't get solved in time for Gutsy, you might want to blacklist this video card.

| Using 'human' theme breaks compiz.  I cannot launch gnome-compiz-preferences while using 'human' theme.  Also, 'plane and slide' may show 4 desktops but I can only switch between 2.  Changing to 'clearlooks' fixes.

| Crashed X when changing from "Normal" to "Extra"
| 00:02.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: Intel Corporation Mobile GM965/GL960 Integrated Graphics Controller [8086:2a02] (rev 03)
| 1. Both the live-cd and the initial tribe5 install had 3d effects running smooth on the Intel GMA 3100 (on an Acer 6292), but later (probably when doing something with "Appearance"->"Visual Effects") X crashed, and started up with an altered configuration, now with 640x480 in stead of native 1280x800. I had to manually select another LCD screen (widescreen) in order to make it work againg. After the crash I could not get *any* 3d-effects, and starting the gnome-appearance-properties from terminal showed that my card was blacklisted. compiz.real --version showed compiz 0.5.3

| Not sure if these are "bugs" per se, but there are many small issues with window focus and graphical details: 1. when I click with "ALT" in a window, it doesn't come to the front, as it does when not using the effects. 2. I use hiding panels, which are always displayed *beneath* windows.  Thus, if you put a window at the edge of the desktop, and then cause the panel to pop out, it is obscured by the window.
| 01:00.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: ATI Technologies Inc Radeon Mobility M7 LW [Radeon Mobility 7500] [1002:4c57]

| 07:00.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: nVidia Corporation G71 [GeForce 7900 GS] [10de:0292] (rev a1)
| The bug #147943 is still not completely fixed even if situation is better than it was. I must notice that my hardware worked perfectly well under Feisty with Compiz 0.3.6 enabled, KDE and the GTK window decorator

Unless I'm misunderstanding something, the 3D test will break on any non-Nvidia driver, as it's the only driver that actually does the texture-from-pixmap indirect rendering magic. Everything else will paint directly on top of everything else, at best. --alex@weej.com

Bug #141533 solved for me (so Works and Video tests are now Yes) by updating Gutsy to get the latest free -ati driver (package xserver-xorg-video-ati) version 1:6.7.194-1ubuntu1; see comments in that bug. If you have the same issue, try updating your system to get this new driver version and see if the problem dissapears. --Eduardo José Moreira (28/09/2007)
