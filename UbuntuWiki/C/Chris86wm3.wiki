=== About Me ===
My name's Chris. I've been an Ubuntu user since 2005. I use Ubuntu as my primary desktop, but I also dabble in Zenwalk and a few other distros. I love anything tech related. On a non-geek side I'm also a big sports fan. Baseball, Football, Basketball, Hockey, you name it I'm there.

=== LoCo Membership ===

I'm a member of the Louisiana Loco Team
