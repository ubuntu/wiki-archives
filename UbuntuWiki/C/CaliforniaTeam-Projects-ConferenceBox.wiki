A conference box is a pre-fab box that we have just sitting around to cut down on the 'what do we need to bring?' aspect of exhibiting at conferences.

Right now, this is a copy of SCaLE stuff.  Will be cleaned up in a few hours!

If you can't figure out the wiki formatting, just add items/comments underneath, and someone else will come wikify it.

Feel free to make any comments/suggestions/additions!

=== Stuff Assumed Provided ===
* 8' wide x 10' deep booth, pipe and curtain style
** 8' tall back wall
** 3' tall side walls
* 6' Table (1)
* Electrical Outlet (1)
* Network Drop (1)
* Two Chairs (maybe more)
