We celebrated the <nowiki>[[OneiricReleaseSchedule|release of Ubuntu 11.10 (Oneiric Ocelot)]]</nowiki> released October 13, 2011. (see below)  Oneiric is *not* a Long Term Support (<nowiki>[[LTS]]</nowiki>) release but continues to set the stage for the next (12.04) LTS.  Physical and virtual (IRC & other) Oneiric events will be scheduled.  Each release cycle a number of efforts happen focused around the release.  Globally, <nowiki>[[UbuntuDeveloperWeek]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[UbuntuGlobalJam]]</nowiki> events happen a month or two before the release focusing on new contributors.  Parties (listed below) and <nowiki>[[UbuntuOpenWeek]]</nowiki> happen near or after the release.  If you are thinking about organizing one, <nowiki>[[BuildingCommunity-RunningReleaseParty]]</nowiki> has some hints more hints are described in a video <nowiki>[[http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/6181333|how to do a release party.]]</nowiki> "... can be organized in literally 10 minutes."

== Oneiric Release Parties ==

We will plan release parties in future IRC meetings and on the mailing list.

These events are listed chronologically. Details have yet to be confirmed. World wide events are listed on the <nowiki>[[http://loco.ubuntu.com/|LoCo directory]]</nowiki>.
