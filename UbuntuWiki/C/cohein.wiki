=== About Co Hein ===

Hi guys. I'm Hein Htet. And I'm from Mandalay, Myanmar(Burma). 

I started to use Ubuntu in 2011. I have lots of trouble when I start use it. But our local community team helps me to know more about Ubuntu. Because of them, I love to use Ubuntu and love to share my experiences 
for the other beginners who want to use Ubuntu. And now, I'm also a Member of our local community, Ubuntu Myanmar LoCo Team.

In 4th December, 2011; Ubuntu Myanmar LoCo Team shared about Ubuntu in Mandalay, Ubuntu Hour Mandalay. After that, they frequently made Ubuntu activities in Mandalay, Monywa, Taunggyi, Lashio and Pyay. They often made Ubuntu basic and intermediate classes in Yangon and Mandalay. 

I always admire Ubuntu Myanmar LoCo Team and Team Members for their activities in Myanmar.
