 02:01:43 <nhaines> Welcome to the Ubuntu California meeting for May 6th, 2018!
 02:01:54 <metalbiker> here, here
 02:01:56 <nhaines> Tonight's agenda is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CaliforniaTeam/Meetings/18May06
 02:01:57 <darthrobot`> Title: [CaliforniaTeam/Meetings/18May06 - Ubuntu Wiki]
 02:02:32 <nhaines> The agenda is empty and I just flew back in from Spain, so we don't have a lot planned, but I wanted to just touch on a couple of things.
 02:02:42 <metalbiker> cool!
 02:02:42 <nhaines> #topic Upcoming Events
 02:02:54 <nhaines> Anything cool coming up soon?
 02:03:39 <metalbiker> nothing from my side of the desert. lol i've got a few things brewing but i'm waiting to have it all together before announcign
 02:03:45 <metalbiker> oops..announcing
 02:03:51 <metalbiker> and i'll do that over the mailing list.
 02:03:54 <nhaines> That sounds like a good idea.  :)  Let us know on the mailing list if you need any help.
 02:04:15 <metalbiker> ok, cool.
 02:04:23 <nhaines> #topic Announcements
 02:04:36 <nhaines> Ubuntu 18.04 LTS is released, and it's pretty swell.
 02:04:43 <metalbiker> i agree!
 02:05:00 <metalbiker> i'm using kubuntu 18.04 and i'm blown away
 02:05:20 <nhaines> If you still like Unity, upgrades include it, and new installs can add it by running `sudo apt install unity-session` in a terminal.  Select it from the login screen with the gear icon after choosing your user.
 02:05:40 <nhaines> Otherwise, it's new versions of everything and there are even some snaps preinstalled by default!
 02:06:18 <nhaines> The desktop should be reliable enough, but this should be a fun release to build servers on soon.  :)
 02:07:03 <metalbiker> oh yeah! i agree! that's part of my new focus but like i mentioned, i'll announce more on the list.
 02:07:17 <nhaines> This will also be an excellent release to host installfests on, because the new GNOME Shell interface lends itself to answering lots of questions.
 02:07:24 <nhaines> metalbiker: I look forward to hearing more.  :)
 02:07:35 <nhaines> #topic Agenda
 02:07:39 <nhaines> There is no agenda for tonight's meeting.
 02:07:43 <nhaines> #topic Other business
 02:08:02 <nhaines> It's quiet in here tonight.  Is there any other business before we wrap things up?
 02:08:42 <metalbiker> nothing from me, nathan.
 02:10:01 <nhaines> I'll mention for the record that UbuCon Europe was a huge success, the Ubuntu Europe Federation is a collection of LoCo teams looking to share knowledge and experience in event planning and handle venue issues such as insurance and donations, and GijÃ³n and Asturias are really pretty, even when it's raining.  (And the rest of Spain looked gorgeous from 32,000 feet.)
 02:10:30 <nhaines> Also, I managed to pack the cider I brought back properly so that it didn't shatter and destroy all my clothes, so that was a plus.
 02:10:34 <metalbiker> lol wow!! i'm envious!!
 02:11:11 <nhaines> You say that, but you didn't get dragged on a four-hour bike ride and then four days later a six and a half-hour hike to the top of a mountain, lol.
 02:11:16 <metalbiker> hopefully we can learn from UbuCon about our own planning and whatnot
 02:11:40 <metalbiker> oh jeez!!
 02:11:58 <metalbiker> i think i'd be jello after all that! lol
 02:12:20 <nhaines> The UbuCon Europe teams went to SCALE two years ago to learn from us, and then the first event later that year was a huge success.  This third event continues that trend.  :)
 02:12:22 <metalbiker> think of it like this: you climbed Mt. Ubuntu!
 02:12:54 <metalbiker> oh nice! so they got it from SCALE! nice!
 02:13:00 <nhaines> More in the obligatory blog post, since Ubuntu community donation funds paid for my travel expenses.  :)
 02:13:22 <nhaines> But yeah, we're all working together in little ways to help make things easier.
 02:13:40 <nhaines> That's it for this meeting!  Next meeting is May 20th!
