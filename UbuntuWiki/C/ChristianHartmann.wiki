=== Some words about me ===

I started using Linux on servers and desktops in mid 2000. Since then I've tried several distributons. I've been a gentoo developer for about 1 1/2 years but retired from my duties lately. Now I'm looking forward to help out with (K)ubuntu development and all the other stuff that I have fun working on. At the moment I'm just looking around to see how things are working here, what is missing and what needs to be done.
