== September 2010 Community Report : Quality ==

<nowiki>[[CommunityReview-Sep2010|<-- Back to the main Community Report page]]</nowiki>

This report is being put together by: '''Ara Pulido'''

This report is here to satisfy the following use case:

<pre>
Sam would like to help test and improve the quality of Ubuntu but is not sure where to begin.
</pre>

The goal of this assessment to identify what typical experience Sam may have and areas in which it can be approved.

=== Assessment Process ===

To perform this assessment we would like to ask those involved to perform the following steps:

1. First put yourself in the position of Sam who has no idea how to participate within this area. How does find out about to participate, where our resources are, which communication channels they can use etc? Please enter your findings into the ''Discoverability'' section below.
2. How does Sam learn the skills to participate in this area? Enter your findings in the ''Learnability' section below.
3. How does Sam know what to work on and how to contribute? Enter your findings in the ''Doability'' section below.
4. Find five community members who are very new to the community and ask them to answer the questions in the ''New Community Member Feedback'' section below.
5. Finally, review all the findings you have notes down here and propose a set of improvements that are concrete things we can work on. Note these in the ''Recommendations For Improvement'' section below.

=== Findings ===

''To ensure our work is as useful as possible, please ensure that all findings are factual and not based on opinion and perception, and where possible, backed up with links to resources that outline the findings''.

==== Discoverability ====

Usually, the first page that our community discover is http://qa.ubuntu.com. This page, which used to be a static page, it is now a WP instance, that can be easily modified by one of the QA members.

The first thing that the potential contributor sees when he or she visits the page is "Join Ubuntu QA!" to indicate that the QA activities in Ubuntu QA are a community itself, and that everybody can be part of it. The second thing that are shown are ways to communicate: the mailing list and the meetings.

Most of the people that goes to that page, usually subscribe to the mailing list and ask there "Where can I start?". So I guess that we should have a section in that page that clearly states "Getting Started" so people can easily know where to start without needing to ask.

Also, the <nowiki>[[http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk|OMGUbuntu]]</nowiki> people often publish some of the call for testing that we make. We could do better work on communicating directly with them, instead of just waiting for them to read Planet Ubuntu and reporting on it.

==== Learnability ====

===== Documentation/Resources available =====
 
* Landing page: http://qa.ubuntu.com
* Wiki documentation: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QATeam/
* Tools: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu-qa-tools

===== Support channels =====

* Mailing list: https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-quality
* Freenode channels: #ubuntu-testing, #ubuntu-quality, #ubuntu-bugs
* Meetings: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QATeam/Meetings

==== Doability ====

The first thing that it is difficult for people that start to contribute is knowing exactly where to start. There are a lot of activities to do, but very few know upfront the first thing they can do. That is why they often ask in the mailing list first.

Once they start contributing and following the mailing list for several weeks, they start to know very quickly where to keep contributing and how. They participate in ISO testing, Desktop testing, triaging bugs, meetings, etc.

==== New Community Member Feedback ====

''Within this part of the community, look at which community members are new (such as new MOTUs in the Packager assessment or those newly participating in LoCo teams in the Advocacy assessment) and pick five community members to answer the following questions on this page.

* '''PROBLEM''': People would need documentation in their own language.
* '''RECOMMENDED SOLUTION''': We will engage the LoCo teams and translations teams to translate some of the resources for testing the ISOs, like testcases.
