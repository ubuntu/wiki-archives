Volunteer recruitment

I wrote this guide for new recruits to see if its possible to reach out to more volunteers using different mediums. Mainly on a local level. 

Lubuntu Documentation team needs help.

Lubuntu (1) is a Lightweight Ubuntu Linux based operating system that is built for low power, lower memory computers. It uses the lxde (2) front end, which is the same as the Raspberry pi uses. 

The documentation team would like some help in writing both a manual and a wiki (online manual) for the next major Long Term Support release in April 2014. 

If you would like to  become involved then please see some of the links below. 

1) https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu - lubuntu wiki introduction to Lubuntu

2) http://lxde.org/ - LXDE website.

3) https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lubuntu/GettingInvolved – How to get involved.

'''PCManFM'''

If you currently use Lubuntu 13.04 or earlier then your option for file searching is limited. For systems below version 13.04, Catfish is the default search utility.

To use Catfish, select tools and then select Find Files or press Shift-Ctrl-F 

Select tools and then select Find Files or do Shift-Ctrl-F

So it’s a case of out with the old and in with the new.

13.10 changed this. The file search is vastly improved and integrated within the file manager. 

 
The Main search files window

The most useful feature here is adding new places to search. Click add and select a new location from the file manager (e.g external hdd). It adds (what?) to the list.
Be careful with the case options as otherwise if your file is called TEXTFILE.TXT and you search for textfile.txt, it either will or will not find it. 

Regular expression is so you can search for part of a filename.

Searching by File Type

I think this is pretty self explanatory

<nowiki>[[File:seach-contains.png]]</nowiki>

Search file content – again like before but looks in side certain files for text, so it’s like having grep built in

Again if you know when you created a file,  or how big it is,  you can use these options to find files on your computer.

Thoughts

What would be useful,

As this can look inside files, maybe options such as being able to search inside a file once you have found it,  run things like word count, etc.   from within the file manager.

Maybe options to say find all files of a particular type and then move them somewhere (e.g all .png files)

Ability to perhaps search on the cloud (probably more complex) but cloud integration could be where things are going anyway.
