Switching to Ubuntu-Linux from windows and other *nix
------------------------------------------------------
As i wrote above in my experience that my major work is on windows platform but in year 2001 i have developed my intrest towards open source platform and i started my learning *nix , since then i shifted to different operating systems including redhat , freebsd , openbsd , fedora and finally i got break with Ubuntu Linux :) the best flavour of linux among such a competition where u can see new operating systems every day . The best of Ubuntu-Linux is a hassle free support and free shipment of cds and easy to use interface

My ubuntu linux experience
