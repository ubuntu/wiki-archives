=== About Me ===
<nowiki>[[File:abatar.jpg]]</nowiki>
* My name is Mariano Paz, Ruby Developer at SUmavisos S.A., a Software Development Company.

* My first contact with the GNU/Linux world was on april 2003 when a copy of RH 7 came to my hands (I was 15) but I didn't could enjoy it because we only had one familiar computer, the risk was to big.(mothers ... you know) 
Then, in march 2008 I meet Ubuntu (GG), it was love at first sight.
Today, I use Kubuntu KK at home (mi sister, mother and I are using it), at work to. My lovely girlfriend Giannina fell into the Kubuntu's world to, was my fault , and she loves to.
