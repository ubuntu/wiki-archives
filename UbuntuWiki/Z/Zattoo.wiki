Zattoo is a cross-platform p2p internet TV application which allows
you to watch TV on your laptop or Desktop. http://zattoo.com/

'''Installing Zattoo on 64-bit Ubuntu'''

Zattoo was, yet is currently no longer available as a download for Ubunteros. Yet if you have kept a previous .deb version or know someone who does, it will still run! 

 1. The Zattoo .deb was made for 32-bit so we'll have to use the force command

<pre>
sudo dpkg -i --force-all zattoo-3.3.3.20775-i386.deb
</pre>

 1.#2  We'll need getlibs. This is not in the repositories so we need to go to  http://frozenfox.freehostia.com/cappy/ and choose the '''getlibs-all.deb''' Install the usual way. 

 1. Now that getlibs are available we can finish with:

<pre>
sudo apt-get install getlibs && getlibs /usr/bin/zattoo_player
</pre>

 1.#4 Run Zattoo player ( from your main menu: Applications -> Sound & video -> Zattoo player) and start to watch TV! (You may need to register for a new account if you don't already have one, but the registration steps are really simple)

'''Enjoy'''
