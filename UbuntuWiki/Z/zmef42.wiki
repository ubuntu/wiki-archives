=== About Me ===

Father, husband, world citizen, and big ole nerd!  🤓 

I'm a former Windows user who switched to Ubuntu because I wanted to feel like a rebel. Now I just spend my days trying to figure out how to make my terminal look cooler.

I wrote this: <nowiki>[[https://www.linux.com/news/debian-legacy/|Debian Legacy]]</nowiki> the editors changed the capitalization of legacy because they were being cheeky.

=== Contributions ===
I'm practically worthless 🤪
While I am not the most technical fellow, I have done "Hello World" in at least 20 languages.

My contributions to Ubuntu are difficult to quantify. I have been recommending it to folks looking for an alternative to other popular operating systems for years.

I have installed it for students and families at homes, schools, and installfests.

Promoted Ubuntu{*} at Software Freedom Day celebrations locally.

=== Future Goals ===

I want to help build the Ubuntu community. My specific interest is the security of Ubuntu over proprietary alternatives. With all the interest in network and information security, I believe the only way forward is with open-source and Free Software.

Representing IllinoisTeam at the Midwest Superfest!

Creating a Capture the Flag challenge introducing people to Free/Libre Open Source concepts and basic cybersecurity challenges for SFD 2024

Building an organization that promotes the ideals of Ubuntu, GNU/Linux, and Free Software. Helping people become securely connected utilizing free/libre tools while educating them about the importance of learning and using these incredible achievements of humanity.
