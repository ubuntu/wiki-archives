Hey guys, I'm Z3R0 from Ohio. I'm 15, and I have about 1 year experience with Adobe Photoshop. I joined the graphic team because I love to work in photoshop. Although I don't have much graphic experience as you see I've only worked at it for one year, I grasp most photoshop techniques very quickly.  If I get the time, I'd love to learn to skin Ubuntu.
