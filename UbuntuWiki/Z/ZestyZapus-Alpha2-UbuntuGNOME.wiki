== 17.04 Release Notes ==
<<BR>>
<nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuGNOME | Ubuntu GNOME]]</nowiki> is an official flavor of Ubuntu, featuring the <nowiki>[[http://www.gnome.org/ | GNOME]]</nowiki> desktop environment. 

The second alpha of '''Ubuntu GNOME 17.04''' (codename "Zesty Zapus") is now available. The development team is proud to offer this development milestone to encourage testing to ensure the final release is as good as possible. Please note that this is still alpha software. We appreciate your help in identifying bugs and bugfixes to ensure that the final 17.04 release will be another great release!

Ubuntu GNOME 17.04 will be released '''<nowiki>[[ZestyZapus-ReleaseSchedule|April 13, 2017]]</nowiki>'''. This regular release will be supported for 9 months from October 2016 until July 2017. If you need longer support, we encourage you to use Ubuntu GNOME 16.04 LTS which is supported until April 2019.

Please note that you do not have to wait for a milestone to test Ubuntu. All of our <nowiki>[[http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-gnome/daily-live/current/ |daily images]]</nowiki> should be installable and should be usable with the usual warnings about pre-release alpha software.

=== Getting Ubuntu GNOME 17.04 ===
<<BR>>
==== Minimum System Requirements ====
** 1 GHz processor (e.g Intel Celeron) or better
** 1.5 GB RAM
** 8 GB of free hard drive space
** CD/DVD drive or a USB port for the installation media
** Internet access recommended (for installing updates during installation)

If you have an old machine, consider less resource-intensive alternatives such as <nowiki>[[Lubuntu]]</nowiki> or <nowiki>[[Xubuntu]]</nowiki>.

<<BR>>
==== Download Disk Image ====
<nowiki>[[http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-gnome/releases/17.04/alpha-2/| Disk images for standard PCs/laptops.]]</nowiki>

If your PC was released after the year 2007, you probably need the 64-bit version.

Please use the torrent link. <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BitTorrent | BitTorrent]]</nowiki> is a good client if you do not already have one.

** Torrenting is fast and saves on server costs, which means more money in the budget for all Ubuntu flavors

** Seeding is an easy way to help others!

<<BR>>
==== Check MD5SUM ====
An MD5SUM is like a fingerprint: two copies of the same file should share the same exact MD5SUM.

** <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HowToMD5SUM | Compute the MD5SUM]]</nowiki> of your downloaded disk image, then 
** Compare it against <nowiki>[[http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-gnome/releases/16.10/release/MD5SUMS | the reference MD5SUM]]</nowiki>

If they are not equal, that means your file was corrupted during download, and you must download it again.

<<BR>>
==== Upgrade ====
If you were using the gnome3-team/gnome3-staging PPA, run the following before upgrading:
<pre>
sudo ppa-purge ppa:gnome3-team/gnome3-staging
sudo ppa-purge ppa:gnome3-team/gnome3
sudo apt install ubuntu-gnome-desktop^
</pre>
<<BR>>

The included GUI update manager will offer you the latest release of Ubuntu GNOME. Access this via the terminal:

<pre>
update-manager -d
</pre>
<<BR>>

Alternatively, run the following command:

<pre>
sudo do-release-upgrade -d
</pre>

==== Select GNOME changes since Ubuntu 16.10 ====
** Ubuntu GNOME 17.04 proudly features '''GNOME 3.22'''. Read the official 3.22 <nowiki>[[https://help.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/3.22/|release notes]]</nowiki> to see what's new.
** A few apps are still at their '''GNOME 3.20''' versions: the Files app nautilus (Bug:1635988) and the Terminal app (Bug:1636666). See the <nowiki>[[http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-gnome/daily-live/current/zesty-desktop-amd64.manifest | manifest]]</nowiki> for specific version numbers of included software.
** '''Flatpak''' 0.8 is now installed by default. Ubuntu Snap (snapd) is still installed. Both Flatpak and Ubuntu Snap are alternative app installation frameworks.
** The '''chrome-gnome-shell''' system helper is installed by default. Just install the extension to be able to manage GNOME Shell extensions at https://extensions.gnome.org/ from <nowiki>[[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gnome-shell-integration/gphhapmejobijbbhgpjhcjognlahblep|Chrome, Chromium, Vivaldi]]</nowiki>, or <nowiki>[[https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/gnome-shell-integration/|Opera]]</nowiki>.
** The '''tracker''' search indexing engine is now sandboxed.
** Several apps are no longer installed for new installs, but will not be automatically removed from existing installs: brasero (a CD burning app), evolution (email suite), seahorse (GPG and SSH key management app), xdiagnose (display troubleshooting app). These apps are still available for install.
** '''gnome-icon-theme''' is no longer installed for new installs. The default icons have been provided by the Adwaita icon theme instead for the past 2 years. This might cause issues for some older apps that still try to use old stock icon names. If this affects an app you use, please file a bug and install gnome-icon-theme as a workaround.
** For other changes since Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, see the <nowiki>[[YakketyYak-ReleaseNotes-UbuntuGNOME | 16.10 Release Notes]]</nowiki>.

<<BR>>
==== Other Software Updates ====
** The experimental '''wayland''' session is included but is not the default. If your computer supports open source graphics drivers and you would like to try Wayland, log out, choose ''GNOME on Wayland'' from the gear menu below the password entry, and log back in.
** Many other bugs have been fixed. Where possible, bug fixes have been backported to Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. Volunteers are requested to identify other bug fixes that can be provided to 16.04 as <nowiki>[[StableReleaseUpdates | Stable Release Updates]]</nowiki>.
