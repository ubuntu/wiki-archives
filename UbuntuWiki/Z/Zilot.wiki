My name is Hai, A senior software developer in Hanoi, Vietnam. I started to work with Linux long time ago. Red hat 6.2 then 7.2 are used to be my favorite distros before I found Ubuntu. Ubuntu is a community developed, Linux-based operating system that is perfect for laptops, desktops and servers. It contains all the applications you need - a web browser, presentation, document and spreadsheet software, instant messaging and much more.

Ubuntu 9.10 is coming soon! :)
