[19:04:52] <inetpro> +1
[19:05:30] <captine> Kilos, hope I can bank your vote when applying :-)
[19:05:41] <stickyboy> I'm good.
[19:05:47] <Kilos> hehe
[19:06:20] <inetpro> Maaz: Kilos++ [for membership of the Ubuntu Membership Board]
[19:06:23] <superfly> Anything else to add to events?
[19:06:26] <Kilos> its actually simple, do enough to get great testimonials
[19:06:35] <superfly> inetpro: should I add your idea for release parties?
[19:06:51] <inetpro> superfly: sure
[19:07:04] <superfly> Maaz: idea Release Parties for 15.04
[19:07:04] <Maaz> Idea recorded: Release Parties for 15.04
[19:07:20] <stickyboy> But didn't they already release 15.04?
[19:07:23] <superfly> Great. Moving on.
[19:07:38] <superfly> Maaz: topic Ubuntu 15.04
[19:07:38] <Maaz> Current Topic: Ubuntu 15.04
[19:07:56] <superfly> stickyboy: yes, a release party celebrates the release of a new version of Ubuntu
[19:08:18] <stickyboy> superfly: Sure. I was just thinking it's a bit late. :P
[19:08:27] <stickyboy> But I guess it was just a few days ago or so.
[19:08:31] <inetpro> stickyboy: http://loco.ubuntu.com/events/global/3075/
[19:09:02] <stickyboy> Cool, can someone make a cake for it?
[19:09:14] <stickyboy> Like the IE and Chrome teams send each other on release days. :P
[19:09:21] <Kilos> aw where is maia
[19:09:51] <captine> stickyboy, lol
[19:09:55] * inetpro running on Kubuntu 15.04 right now
[19:10:15] <captine> inetpro, nice. how is it treating you.  I am a little nervous to go to it with the system D changes etc
[19:10:26] <stickyboy> systemd is #winning to be honest.
[19:10:29] <CuttingEdge> inetpro: you may have some catching up to do .. i've done 4 machines already ;)
[19:10:32] <stickyboy> Today I learned about systemd-nspawn...
[19:10:58] <inetpro> captine: it's awesome, but at the same time not without some minor glitches
[19:11:31] <stickyboy> systemd-nspawn makes it super easy to use containers.
[19:11:38] <stickyboy> I haven't found a use for containers yet, but I will.
[19:12:35] <arnaudmez> containers ???
[19:12:45] <arnaudmez> tell me more about stickyboy
[19:13:10] <superfly> alright boys. let's keep to meeting during meeting time
[19:13:30] <Jacques_Stry> On my machines I have found that 15.04 takes quite a bit longer to boot up...
[19:13:31] <stickyboy> Ooops, didn't realize it was a meeting.
[19:13:44] <captine> inetpro, I hear a lot of great things about Mate 15.04 (new ubuntu family member :).  Dude on Linux Unplugged podcast is one of the key developers/maintainers
[19:13:47] <Jacques_Stry> :)
[19:13:52] <inetpro> I normally disable fancy desktop behaviours but haven't figured how to do it here, must say I'm surprised how smooth it's running 
[19:14:30] <captine> i need a good day to install it if I do. Using mac mini as my desktop and installing non-apple OS is a pain.
[19:15:09] <superfly> Any other comments on 15.04?
[19:15:44] <superfly> Right. Moving on.
[19:15:45] <inetpro> KDE Connect is really awesome, allowing me to drive my desktop mouse with the Andoid device
[19:15:46] <Padroni> did you upgrade or clean install?
[19:15:59] <arnaudmez> superfly: found it a bit slower than Mint 17 but maybe I need to reinstall and see
[19:16:34] <arnaudmez> inetpro: will take a time and try 
[19:16:44] * superfly did an upgrade
[19:17:08] <inetpro> Padroni: I did a clean install but copied my home folder across before first login
[19:17:24] * Padroni needs to back up his home folder
[19:17:35] <superfly> K, let's move on.
[19:17:39] <inetpro> always make a backup!!!
[19:17:42] <captine> cool
[19:17:51] <arnaudmez> inetpro: does it work without causing issues now ?
[19:17:52] <Squirm> I have my / mounted on a 20Gb partition and /home on the remainder of the drive. So my home folder follows me around :)
[19:18:01] <superfly> Maaz: topic Miscellaneous
[19:18:01] <Maaz> Current Topic: Miscellaneous
[19:18:09] <superfly> anything else?
[19:18:22] <inetpro> arnaudmez: let's talk more after the meeting
[19:18:23] <arnaudmez> 'cause i remember years ago that copy-paste of home was problematic ... really
[19:18:39] <Squirm> arnaudmez: works for me
[19:18:47] <arnaudmez> sorry guys, what's the meeting topic
[19:18:48] <Squirm> Nothing my side superfly
[19:18:49] <inetpro> I didn't have problems with that at all
[19:18:55] <arnaudmez> i came late today
[19:18:56] <captine> saw some mails on one of the mailing lists about some documentation project?  Anyone have any more info on that?  think it is general and not Ubuntu specific
[19:19:15] <Kilos> speak to Jacques_Stry  captine  
[19:19:35] <captine> looking up emails quick
[19:20:54] <inetpro> oh, if anyone else knows more Ubuntu people in the rest of Africa please talk to Kilos, he's lining them up at #ubuntu-africa
[19:21:28] <Kilos> superfly

[19:22:19] * Padroni will do
[19:22:25] <captine> so.,..  I unfortunately went back to Windows 8.1 at work after using Ubuntu for about a month as my main desktop.  Was fun, but changing roles means no longer in IT so need to conform
[19:22:25] <Kilos> ty
[19:22:28] <gremble> I can, but I don't have many friends :P
[19:22:46] <gremble> captine: You have my condolences
[19:22:55] <Kilos> maybe from ubuntu-za in fb even
[19:22:57] <captine> thnx gremble... 
[19:22:57] <Padroni> jeez

[19:23:06] * Padroni is a mocker of Windoze 8 users...
[19:23:10] <captine> or whatever
[19:23:17] <captine> Padroni, not a win expert
[19:23:25] <captine> think it is 8.1... isnt it?
[19:23:49] <Padroni> both are equally useless
[19:23:52] <captine> yip it is.  just checked :)
[19:24:04] <Squirm> captine: roles?
