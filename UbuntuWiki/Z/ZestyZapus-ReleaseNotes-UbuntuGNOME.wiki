== 17.04 Release Notes ==
<<BR>>
<nowiki>[[UbuntuGNOME | Ubuntu GNOME]]</nowiki> is an official flavor of Ubuntu, featuring the <nowiki>[[http://www.gnome.org/ | GNOME]]</nowiki> desktop environment. 

Ubuntu GNOME 17.04 is a regular release and will be supported for 9 months until <nowiki>[[Releases|January 2018]]</nowiki>. If you need longer support, we encourage you to use <nowiki>[[XenialXerus-ReleaseNotes-UbuntuGNOME|Ubuntu GNOME 16.04 LTS]]</nowiki> which is supported until April 2019.

<<BR>>
=== Getting Ubuntu GNOME 17.04 ===
<<BR>>
==== Minimum System Requirements ====
** 1 GHz processor (e.g Intel Celeron) or better
** 1.5 GB RAM
** 10 GB of free hard drive space
** CD/DVD drive or a USB port for the installation media
** Internet access recommended (for installing updates during installation)

If you have an old machine, consider less resource-intensive alternatives such as <nowiki>[[Lubuntu]]</nowiki> or <nowiki>[[Xubuntu]]</nowiki>.

<<BR>>
==== Download Disk Image ====
<nowiki>[[http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-gnome/releases/17.04/release/| Disk images for standard PCs/laptops.]]</nowiki>

If your PC was released after the year 2007, you probably need the 64-bit version.

Please use the torrent link. <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BitTorrent | BitTorrent]]</nowiki> is a good client if you do not already have one.

** Torrenting is fast and saves on server costs, which means more money in the budget for all Ubuntu flavors

** Seeding is an easy way to help others!

<<BR>>
==== Check MD5SUM ====
An MD5SUM is like a fingerprint: two copies of the same file should share the same exact MD5SUM.

** <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HowToMD5SUM | Compute the MD5SUM]]</nowiki> of your downloaded disk image, then 
** Compare it against <nowiki>[[http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-gnome/releases/17.04/release/MD5SUMS | the reference MD5SUM]]</nowiki>

If they are not equal, that means your file was corrupted during download, and you must download it again.

<<BR>>
==== Upgrade ====
If you were using the gnome3-team/gnome3-staging PPA, run the following before upgrading:
<pre>
sudo ppa-purge ppa:gnome3-team/gnome3-staging
sudo ppa-purge ppa:gnome3-team/gnome3
sudo apt-get install ubuntu-gnome-desktop^
</pre>
<<BR>>

The included GUI update manager will offer you the latest release of Ubuntu GNOME. Access this via the terminal:

<pre>
update-manager -d
</pre>
<<BR>>

Alternatively, run the following command:

<pre>
sudo do-release-upgrade -d
</pre>

==== Select GNOME changes since Ubuntu 16.10 ====
** Ubuntu GNOME 17.04 proudly features '''GNOME 3.24'''. Read the official <nowiki>[[https://help.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/3.22/|3.22]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[https://help.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/3.24/|3.24]]</nowiki> release notes to see what's new! Or take a few minutes to watch the GNOME 3.24 <nowiki>[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z1PAXiyTB0|release video]]</nowiki>.
** GNOME 3.24 introduces '''Night Light''' which can automatically reduce the blue light emitted by your computer screen at sunset or whenever you choose.
** The Calendar app now has a '''Week''' view.
** For stability, the Evolution stack is still at its '''GNOME 3.22''' versions.
** A few apps are still at their '''GNOME 3.20''' versions: the Files app nautilus (Bug:1635988) and the Terminal app (Bug:1636666). See the <nowiki>[[http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-gnome/daily-live/current/zesty-desktop-amd64.manifest | manifest]]</nowiki> for specific version numbers of included software.
** The '''Software''' app has been updated to 3.22 and now supports GNOME Shell extensions and Flatpak.
** '''Flatpak''' 0.8 is now installed by default. Ubuntu Snap (snapd) is still installed. Both Flatpak and Ubuntu Snap are alternative app installation frameworks.
** The '''chrome-gnome-shell''' system helper is installed by default. Visit https://extensions.gnome.org/ to install the required browser addon to use the site to manage your GNOME Shell extensions.
** The '''tracker''' search indexing engine is now sandboxed.
** Several apps are no longer installed for new installs, but will not be automatically removed from existing installs: brasero (a CD burning app), evolution (email suite), seahorse (GPG and SSH key management app), xdiagnose (display troubleshooting app). These apps are still available for install in the Software app.
** '''gnome-icon-theme''' is no longer installed for new installs. The default icons have been provided by the Adwaita icon theme instead for the past 2 years. This might cause issues for some older apps that still try to use old stock icon names. If this affects an app you use, please file a bug and install gnome-icon-theme as a workaround.
** '''gconf''' is no longer installed by default since it has long been superseded by gsettings. Note that statistics and preferences for the aisleriot card games will be reset when upgrading to 17.04. 
** The brand new '''GNOME Recipes''' app is available for install but is not installed by default.
** '''GNOME Games''' (gnome-games-app) is also available for install.
** For other changes since Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, see the <nowiki>[[YakketyYak-ReleaseNotes-UbuntuGNOME | 16.10 Release Notes]]</nowiki>.

<<BR>>
==== Other Software Updates ====
** '''<nowiki>[[https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/ReleaseNotes/5.3|LibreOffice 5.3]]</nowiki>''' is included.
** The '''Linux kernel''' has been updated to 4.10.
** For new installs, a '''swap file''' will be used by default instead of a swap partition.
** The default DNS resolver is now '''systemd-resolved'''.
** The experimental '''wayland''' session is included but is not the default. If your computer supports open source graphics drivers and you would like to try Wayland, log out, choose ''GNOME on Wayland'' from the gear menu below the password entry, and log back in.
** Many other bugs have been fixed. Where possible, bug fixes have been backported to Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. Volunteers are requested to identify other bug fixes that can be provided to 16.04 as <nowiki>[[StableReleaseUpdates | Stable Release Updates]]</nowiki>.

<<BR>>
=== Known Bugs ===
<<BR>>
==== New since Ubuntu 16.10 ====
** GNOME Shell 3.24 uses the !SpiderMonkey (mozjs) 38 engine which requires stricter !JavaScript syntax. Some GNOME Shell extensions will need to be fixed by their developers before they can be used with GNOME Shell 3.24.

<<BR>>
==== Also affecting Ubuntu 16.10 ====
** The Software app can't open third-party .debs for packages not in Ubuntu. Also, the Software app can't open .flatpakref files. (Bug:1672424)
** Installing additional languages in 'Region & Language' Settings app doesn't work. You can install language-selector-gnome as a workaround. (Bug:1631750)
** If you log out, GNOME Online Accounts will stop working until you restart your computer (Bug:1610944)
** If you want your Touchpad Settings to work correctly in GNOME, be sure that xserver-xorg-input-synaptics is not installed. Log out after uninstalling it (Bug:1683016)
** Initial Setup utility requires logging out and logging back in after selecting a keyboard layout. Alternatively, you can manually click a keyboard layout in the top bar.
** Initial Setup utility does not include language chooser. (Bug:1614816)
** GTK+ 3.20 requires theme developers to make changes to their themes. Many (but not all) popular themes are now compatible with GTK+ 3.20.

<<BR>>
==== Also affecting Ubuntu 16.04 LTS ====
** The prompt asking for media removal might not be shown during system shutdown from the install image (Bug:966480)
