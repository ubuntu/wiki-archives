__TOC__

* ''Please do not edit''
* Freezes normally happen at 2100 UTC, to permit overnight builds to include the last content. Please make sure all changes have been uploaded before then unless agreed to by the release team.
* October releases follow a 25-week schedule, while April releases follow a 27-week schedule, to compensate for year-end holidays (non-LTS releases might break this cycle to wiggle things a bit).
* Some background information and Q&A about the Ubuntu release process can be found on TimeBasedReleases
* See the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/OtherProjectSchedules|Schedules of other projects]]</nowiki>
