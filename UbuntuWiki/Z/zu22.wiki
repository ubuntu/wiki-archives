==== History ====
Welcome to my Ubuntu Wiki page. I've been using Ubuntu since March 2008. Before that I ran Debian on my desktop for 5 years. I currently use Ubuntu 6.06 (Dapper Drake) LiveCD on my broken laptop until I get a new computer when I shall install Intrepid. I run Debian testing release on my server.
