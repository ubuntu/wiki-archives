[18:57:00] <inetpro> hmm... andrewlsd not here this evening?
[18:57:16] <Kilos> nope he been missing for a while now
[18:58:21] * inetpro wondering about the Khayelitsha installfest activities
[18:58:57] <inetpro> anyone joined the discussion group at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kifest ?
[18:59:12] <pieter2627> nope
[18:59:27] <inetpro> me neither
[18:59:46] <Kilos> kapanda_  whats the iweek
[19:00:37] <kapanda_> http://www.iweek.org.za/
[19:01:23] <kapanda_> Does the link help
[19:02:12] <pieter2627> reminds me of myBroadbands conf
[19:02:15] <kapanda_> Mostly to deal with ISP
[19:02:34] <kapanda_> Yes 
[19:02:51] <inetpro> kapanda_: that looks like an old link
[19:03:18] <kapanda_> They is one this year
[19:03:35] <inetpro> kapanda_: when is it?
[19:03:52] <pieter2627> 7-11 sept
[19:04:06] <inetpro> ah
[19:05:04] <Kilos> someone should go wake up the ISP's
[19:05:04] * inetpro wondering whether we'll see anything there from the open source side of the fence
[19:05:27] <kapanda_> I found a foundation there last year called Coza Care. they claim to be the first to install Ubuntu in schools 
[19:05:44] <inetpro> at least we know the SFD (http://www.sfd.org.za/) event is coming up soon as well
[19:05:50] <inetpro> SFD planned for 19 September 2015 at the Station Lounge, Pretoria Gautrain Station
[19:06:31] <inetpro> kapanda_: interesting
[19:06:56] <gremble> It's a shame they couldnt get a nicer venue. Hopefully there will be interesting talks. You guys planning on hosting one of them install parties?
[19:07:26] <inetpro> gremble: you mean at the iweek event?
[19:07:32] <gremble> SFD
[19:08:28] <inetpro> gremble: hmm... I guess it can be arranged, anyone willing to stand up for that?
[19:09:36] <gremble> I'll be there so I wouldn't mind helping out with you guys. I was the Arch person last year, but I am fairly sure I can play for both teams ;)
[19:09:56] <kulelu88> install parties should be more for beginners now. SFD is already for people using open source
[19:10:21] <inetpro> kulelu88: I agree, those topics are quite advanced these days
[19:10:41] <inetpro> but that doesn't mean we can not try to catch a few newbies
[19:10:55] <Kilos> well said
[19:10:58] <gremble> The talk topics? Yes. A shit-load of containerisation talks haha
[19:11:21] <kulelu88> link to it? 
[19:12:12] <Kilos> http://www.sfd.org.za/
[19:12:12] <gremble> To the talks? I don't have a link, but in 2013 there was quite a few and 2014 was practically dominated by it. 
[19:12:13] <inetpro> Maaz: agreed SFD is planned for 19 September 2015 at the Station Lounge, Pretoria Gautrain Station... details to emerge at http://www.sfd.org.za/
[19:12:13] <Maaz> Agreed: SFD is planned for 19 September 2015 at the Station Lounge, Pretoria Gautrain Station... details to emerge at http://www.sfd.org.za/
