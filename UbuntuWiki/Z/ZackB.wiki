 I have been digging through Ubuntu and just linux in general. I was the founder of a LUG, but there was no active members so I shut it down after a few years. I have been studying several topics about linux. Using buzybox and uClibc, got a root image that's Gzip'ed to just a mere 800Kb's in size, but working on what I want to use it for, just a current project. My main pc is an AMD Anthlon 64 X2 5600+ and has 2Gb of ram which i rarely use more than 700Mb of running Ubuntu 8.04 LTS.
