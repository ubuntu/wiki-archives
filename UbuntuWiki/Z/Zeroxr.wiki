__TOC__



== Introduction ==
Name: Long D.

I am a pharmacy tech with a very large interest in computer technologies in general. I was introduced into the world of computers at the age of 12 and have been involved with computers since. My level of expertise is spread over hardware, software, and security. I am a fan and proponent of the movement for Open Source Software, as the concept and philosophy are ideal to break the "need" for software piracy.
