== Promotional Material ==

As new promotional material is designed, it will be added to this page. This will hopefully allow all members, regardless of geographical location within Zimbabwe, to benefit from the same documents and hand-outs. All members are welcome to contribute, but to maintain uniformity, the team should agree as much as possible on a standard set of documents and material which is to be used throughout the country.

Members responsible for promotional functions and demonstrations in different parts of Zimbabwe will need to organise their own printing of whichever material is required (unless we can find some sort of sponsorship for this).
