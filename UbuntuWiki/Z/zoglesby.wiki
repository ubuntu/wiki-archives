=== About ===
My name is Zach Oglesby, I have been using Linux since the early 2000's, I have seen Linux grow and become much easier to use over the years. I have been evolved with many different communities over the years but have come to use Ubuntu because it 'Just Works' I no longer have time to tinker like I did as a kid, so Ubuntu works great but when I want to tinker I can jump in and get my hands dirty.
