=== Contributions ===

1. '''zBird''' - Flappy Bird clone for UT. Still one of the most popular games in Store. It had many problems (because of different API changes), but now it works good!

2. '''zMusic''' - local app (for Russian market). As far as I understand, the most popular UT app in Russia and one of the most popular in CIS+Ukraine. Music player, which uses VK API (VK - one of the largest social networks in Europe).

3. '''VK Messenger''' - messenger for VK social network. In fact, it is in development, but alpha version was released a week ago.

And etc. List of other applications:

4. '''Simon Says''' -  game for children.

5. '''zConverter''' - very simple currency converter.

6. '''zTTT''' - Tic-Tac-Toe.

7. '''zRace''' - first game with accelerometer. Very simple, I have no opportunity for making normal graphic, I am not a designer.

8. '''FM Radio''' - it was released, but doesn't work now because there is no FM radio support in Ubuntu Touch. It should be landed soon and it will work. Trust me, it will be good app, I love to listen FM radio and simply can't do a bad app.

=== Future Goals ===

Make more applications and scopes!
