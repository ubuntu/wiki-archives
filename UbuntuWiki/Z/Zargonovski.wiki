== Website/Blog ==
I made a blog in which i put my opensource work and codes and talk about security issues , and for programmers it's the best corner to have a nice chat and deal with things and even create a workshop .

== Experience ==
I was one of the three founders of the security group "d4rck cr3w".We were doing pentesting and bugtraqing.And had some experience with web-mastering since i ran several sites including mine , I'd finish my resume by saying that i'm using linux since 2006 and ubuntu since 2007 .
