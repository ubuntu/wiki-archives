[18:59:47] <_Sponge> there should be, but
[18:59:53] <kmf> I'm not doing the project without the support of the Loco
[19:00:20] <kmf> _Sponge can't use the word "Ubuntu" without permission from Canonical 
[19:00:20] <Kilos> imo we are all solidly behind you kmf 
[19:00:46] <chesedo> Maaz: agreed Year Goal - To be part of the Ubuntu for Hope project and to make it a success

[19:05:10] <kapanda> speaking about spreading. Lesson that William proposed I think we need to look at that too
[19:05:36] <chesedo> kapanda: i agree
[19:05:39] 
[19:05:54] <chesedo> it complements this nicely
[19:06:05] <inetpro> kmf: sounds like a good deal, you even get cheap labor as part of the deal there ^^

[19:07:14] <kapanda> :-) yes
[19:08:03] <_Sponge> the ubuntu classsroom irc is never populated.
[19:08:08] <chesedo> williamk: the "Desktop Training" one?
[19:08:11] <kapanda> though people want certification for what they learn, we can plan an End user certification for SA
[19:08:21] <_Sponge> wats Sa ?
[19:08:32] <kapanda> South Africa
[19:08:38] <Kilos> ubuntu classroom is closing down
[19:08:38] <_Sponge> k
[19:09:16] <williamk> kmf : if you have a get together to get the systems ready, please make it on a weekend, I might drive up
[19:09:19] <_Sponge> Does the Loco group have any Ubuntu DVD's for 14.04, left over ?
[19:09:32] <Kilos> we have #linux-studies and can make a new channel if needed
[19:09:47] <kmf> williamk cool :D
[19:09:59] <_Sponge> Does the Loco group have a separate website like www.ubuntu-uk.org.uk ?
[19:10:02] <Kilos> _Sponge someone can download an iso for you
[19:10:26] <_Sponge> you didn't answer my question, but I'm thinking No.
[19:10:37] <inetpro> superfly: will you organise the DVD's for the new release again for us?
[19:10:45] <_Sponge> +1
[19:10:47] <Kilos> https://ubuntu-za.org
[19:10:51] <kmf> reminds me of the OpenICDL
[19:10:55] <inetpro> _Sponge: ^
[19:11:02] <superfly> inetpro: I've never organised them
[19:11:19] <Kilos> also http://ubuntu-africa.info
[19:11:28] <inetpro> superfly: so who does it for us?
[19:11:35] <superfly> inetpro: I'm the secondary contact. Maia is still #1
[19:11:45] <Kilos> maia said she would still do it i think inetpro 
[19:11:56] <inetpro> cool
[19:12:01] <Kilos> when is our re evaluation
[19:12:31] <Kilos> she will do that for /with us as well
[19:12:56] <williamk> kmf : OpenICDL is not the only certification that needs to be done
[19:13:09] <williamk> look at : http://www.ecdl.org/programmes/ecdl_icdl
[19:13:17] <_Sponge> you need to add "Ubuntu scocial" the the SocialMedia dropdown on ubuntu-za.org i.e. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Social
[19:13:25] <williamk> and http://www.ecdl.org/programmes/index.jsp?p=102&n=771
[19:14:08] <_Sponge> **social
[19:15:22] <chesedo> ecdl does not seem to be ubuntu specific?
