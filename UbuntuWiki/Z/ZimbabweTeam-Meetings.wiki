=== Monthly Meetings ===

The Zimbabwe Team members in Harare meet regularly, once a month, in face-to-face meetings. Meetings are held to discuss ongoing projects, plans for the future, and any other issues that are relevant to the Team. Meetings are usually held in the evening of the first Wednesday of every month. Contact team@ubuntu.org.zw for more information. All are welcome to attend, but please advise us in advance so that we have an idea of numbers.
