Hello, I stand between Ubuntu-AR in a few years ago (about 3 years), beginning with the release partys and other things that I like and well here I am!

I am a computer technician, working for a technology company as a technician / consultant, I specialize in Linux / UNIX / NetWare in the enterprise, and install servers and other gadgets that I like! Also from time to time I get to see the occasional printer will not print. Start using Linux in the enterprise and good looks which will spread to some comrades who every day are migrating to Ubuntu.

As a member of Ubuntu-AR participate in several meetings, release partys, Global Jam's, <nowiki>[[http://culturalibre.fmlatribu.com/?p=101|"Fabrica de Fallas"]]</nowiki> and various events.

=== Below I will comment on some events in which I participate: ===

* '''September 2010''', I helped to organize the event at the "Escuela Técnica 36 D.E. 15 - Alte. Brown" (<nowiki>[[.-ArgentinaTeam-ENET36|ENET36, in Spanish]]</nowiki>), where I join the group along with some teachers and former teachers to organize the annual event that makes a conference on Linux and free software. Then attach a certificate issued by way of thanks the authorities of the "Escuela Técnica 36 D.E. 15 - Alte. Brown":
