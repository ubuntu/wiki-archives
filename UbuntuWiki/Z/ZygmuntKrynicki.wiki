=== About ===

I'm a freelance programmer living in Poland. I discovered Ubuntu when Warty was around and Linux in general a year before that. I became an Ubuntu Member on 6th of Dec 2005. I've been involved in Ubuntu for years. I've been an employee of Canonical May 2010 and November 2020, with various responsibilities along the way. I've been an Ubuntu Member in Dec 2005 but allowed my membership to expire, having no time to contribute to the OS outside of my day job work on snapd.

=== Contributions ===

I'm not heavily involved in Ubuntu ever since I left Canonical. I'm trying to be a good maintainer and developer, by working on a small collection of software I wrote. I've become a Debian Maintainer which allows me to look after downstream packaging of my upstream work.

In the past I've been interested in localization, command-not-found and several smaller things. I've since edited those parts out of my wiki page.
