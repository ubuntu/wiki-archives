[17:47:17] <nlsthzn> +1
[17:47:20] <kbmonkey> okay, does anybody have anything to add?
[17:48:11] <lost_and_unfound> the mailing list... is that ubuntu-za@lists.ubuntu.com ?
[17:48:21] <tumbleweed> lost_and_unfound: yes
[17:48:32] <lost_and_unfound> ta
[17:48:38] <kbmonkey> correct lost_and_unfound
[17:48:52] <nlsthzn> are we automatically on the list when we are added on laucnhpad to za/
[17:48:56] <nlsthzn> ?
[17:49:01] <kbmonkey> the URL for the mailing list is https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-za
[17:49:05] <tumbleweed> nlsthzn: no
[17:49:28] <kbmonkey> you can subscribe via that link
[17:49:33] * nlsthzn thinks he is not on the mailing list... oh no wait he is... many problems has spammed his inbox
[17:49:40]
[17:50:07] <kbmonkey> okay let's move on...
[17:50:29] <kbmonkey> Maaz, topic Feedback on Ubuntu CD's sent to regions
[17:50:29] <Maaz> kbmonkey: Just do it yourself
[17:50:35] <nlsthzn> hehe
[17:50:40] <maiatoday> Maaz, topic Feedback on Ubuntu CD's sent to regions
[17:50:40] <Maaz> Current Topic: Feedback on Ubuntu CD's sent to regions
[17:50:58] <queery> i sent 1 CD and it has been received
[17:51:00] <queery> hehe
[17:51:12] <maiatoday> Ok I sent the parcels to the people who responded on my list. Some of them arrived I haven't got feedback from everybody yet
[17:51:25] <tumbleweed> maiatoday: saw your e-mail today, I'll organise collection soon, thanks
[17:51:30] <nlsthzn> the province of UAE has not received any as of yet... :/ ;)
[17:51:33] <maiatoday> Also I am hoping to get some photos so I can make a blog post
[17:51:49] <Kilos> can someone make not of asking cocooncrash to get Maaz working for kbmonkey as well
[17:51:50] <maiatoday> ok tumbleweed cool
[17:51:53] <kbmonkey> To those who received them, we need some photos of your parcel. Or better yet, photos of you handing them out to other people
[17:52:24] <maiatoday> I was hoping for just a pic with cd with two hands but anything will be good
[17:52:24] <lost_and_unfound> what happend with the 'freedom toaster' project. Not sure if that was also part of the loco's. Those unfamiliar, in short it's a stand alone pc in a stand and you just go there and select which distro you want to burn. http://www.meraka.org.za/news/2006/freedomtoast_6june06.html would that not help with distibution of disc's ?
[17:52:26] <queery> ooh good idea
[17:52:43] <nlsthzn> they still work at some uni's afaik
[17:52:46] <maiatoday> I saw the freedom toaster in the library at Stellenbosch last week
[17:52:59] <tumbleweed> lost_and_unfound: probably best discussed after the meeting, if you want more information on it
[17:53:16] <lost_and_unfound> perhaps some bigger malls would be a nice offset if we can get some sponsorss ?
[17:53:27] * nuvolari pulls out his hair
[17:53:34] <maiatoday> So the plan is before the next release which is an LTS I'll update the list of regional contacts and then when the CDs get here I'll to the contacts again
[17:53:42] <Kilos> nuvolari, youre late
[17:53:46] <nuvolari> the first time ubuntu lets me down with the audio
[17:53:50] <nlsthzn> maiatoday, next isn't lts
[17:54:03] <cocooncrash> Maaz: grant chairmeeting to kbmonkey when authed
[17:54:03] <Maaz> cocooncrash: Alrighty
[17:54:09] <nuvolari> Kilos: I know oom, but rather late/no meeting than no sound. and Im stuck without sound now :(
[17:54:12] <maiatoday> ok then we'll practise till the lts comes around :)
[17:54:14] <kbmonkey> thanks cocooncrash
[17:54:20] <nlsthzn> :)
[17:54:21] <maiatoday> thanks cocooncrash
[17:54:24] <kbmonkey> practice makes perfect.
[17:54:49] <kbmonkey> I can take some photos of CD's you sent me maiatoday, but I'll make a mission to hand them out soon
[17:54:59] <maiatoday> Also I am happy to say one of the contacts put some money in my bank account for postage
[17:55:09] <Kilos> nuvolari, di the i am bit
[17:55:15] <Kilos> do
[17:55:16] <nlsthzn> nice
[17:55:26] <maiatoday> kbmonkey: we could probably move on
[17:55:30] <kbmonkey> agreed.
[17:55:40] <kbmonkey> Maaz, topic Feedback on LPI certifications
[17:55:40] <Maaz> Current Topic: Feedback on LPI certifications
[17:55:46] <nlsthzn> yeah
[17:56:02] <kbmonkey> thought I'd mention this again
[17:56:06] <Skarr[m]> my adsl stopped working today :(
[17:56:08] * nlsthzn is a neophyte on the lpi study group
[17:56:24] <nuvolari> Maaz: I am Johan Mynhardt
[17:56:24] <Maaz> nuvolari: Righto
[17:56:25] <kbmonkey> the LPI (Linux Professional Institute) offers certifications.
[17:56:56] <nuvolari> thanks oom Kilos
[17:56:58] <nuvolari> :P
[17:56:58] <kbmonkey> we have set up a mailing list for discussion surrounding that, if anyone is interested, whether you want to write the exams, or just learn with us, visit http://groups.google.com/group/linux-studies
[17:57:05] <Kilos> nuvolari, yw
[17:57:40] <Skarr[m]> Maaz: I am Willem Dreyer
[17:57:40] <Maaz> Skarr[m]: Okay
[17:57:43] <kbmonkey> I have received lots of interest from Ubuntu-ZA and the Durban LUG.
[17:57:47] <nuvolari> Maaz: lpi.link
[17:57:47] <Maaz> nuvolari: lpi.link is http://groups.google.com/group/linux-studies
[17:58:14] <nlsthzn> even from over seas
[17:58:31] <nuvolari> yebo
[17:58:37] <kbmonkey> yes the group is for anyone, we help another online
[17:58:38] <nuvolari> we're not bound by landscapes
[17:58:56] <nuvolari> except we can't go to UAE for exams :P
[17:59:18] <nlsthzn> would it be ok if I tried to get a few more peeps here in on the action... we have exam centres/
[17:59:19] <kbmonkey> There's an international group who does the same, they use mumble and audio conferencing, but not all of us have that luxury, so we will stick to emial and irc
[17:59:19] <nlsthzn> ?
[17:59:34] <maiatoday> kbmonkey do you want to post info about this on ubuntu-za.org?
[17:59:36] <kbmonkey> good idea nlsthzn, I have the same idea
[17:59:40] <Kilos> enquire if nlsthzn can skype the exam so someone can watch him
[17:59:48] <nlsthzn> hehe
[17:59:57] <kbmonkey> maiatoday, I will do so, thanks
[18:00:12] <kbmonkey> Maaz, agreed Wesley will post LPI information on ubuntu-za.org
[18:00:12] <Maaz> Agreed: Wesley will post LPI information on ubuntu-za.org
[18:00:29] <nuvolari> brb. restart and hope my audio worx
[18:01:00] <kbmonkey> did Maaz hear me?
[18:01:17] <Kilos> lol
[18:01:21] <tumbleweed> kbmonkey: shuttleworth foundation used to offer the paper LPI exams locally, ocassionaly. Spoken to any of the guys who used to run them?
[18:01:24] <Kilos> he had to think first
[18:02:20] <kbmonkey> tumbleweed, no not yet. I made contact with the training center in JHB but there are none for us in KZN. Apprently we can write them and Coptia centers, and I will coordinate with the LPI foundation, more on this on the list though.
[18:02:27] * nlsthzn will rally up interest in the UAE...
[18:02:31] <kbmonkey> *Comptia
[18:02:49] <kbmonkey> thanks nlsthzn!
[18:02:57] <kbmonkey> okay I think we can move on
[18:03:01] <tumbleweed> kbmonkey: cool
[18:03:22] <kbmonkey> Maaz, topic Ubuntu hours and meets
[18:03:22] <Maaz> Current Topic: Ubuntu hours and meets
[18:03:55] <kbmonkey> I'll be the first to admit I have been too bad in not organizing more hours
[18:04:11] <kbmonkey> So as a reminder, let us have more Ubuntu hours! :)
[18:04:17] <maiatoday> if it wasn't for queery the hours here would dwindle too
[18:04:44] <maiatoday> thank you queery
[18:04:50] <kbmonkey> So I will make some plans with my local peeps (nuvolari)
[18:04:51] <queery> hehe but i also forget
[18:05:01] <nlsthzn> lol
[18:05:24] <kbmonkey> and I prod everyone else to do the same where possible
[18:05:39] <kbmonkey> if anyone present would like to say so now...?
[18:06:03] * nlsthzn is a tad far
[18:06:10] * kbmonkey adds ubuntu hour to ~/todo
[18:06:40] * queery does so too
[18:07:06] <kbmonkey> on a semi-related note, to get attention and promote the logo when in coffee shops: where can we get stickers or decals?
[18:07:41] <tumbleweed> I have the ubuntu-za table cloth and banner
[18:07:43] <maiatoday> I still have some stickers I had made, also you can have some made the images are on spread ubuntu
