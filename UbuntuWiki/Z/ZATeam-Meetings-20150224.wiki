[18:53:50] <clr_> do you need to affiliate yourself with ubuntu-za there?
[18:53:57] <inetpro> please sign the Code of Conduct as well, if you haven't
[18:53:58] <inetpro> https://launchpad.net/codeofconduct
[18:54:23] <nuvolari> The UCOC is quite important IMO
[18:54:31] <nuvolari> people might think it's overkill
[18:54:54] <nuvolari> but it shows that you take to heart that it's necessary to treat others well
[18:54:58] <nuvolari> even in the tech world
[18:55:15] <Kilos> inetpro  answer clr please
[18:55:18] 
[18:55:33] <inetpro> clr_: no
[18:55:49] <Padroni_> i need more beer
[18:55:51] <inetpro> we're just a local community
[18:56:30] <Kilos> the local community
[18:56:31] <highvoltage> o/
[18:56:39] <clr_> I need A beer
[18:56:41] <inetpro> wb highvoltage
[18:56:41] <Kilos> lo highvoltage  
[18:56:45] <magellanic> what's the aim of the local community though, support each other, outreach? tech help? or?
[18:56:49] <magellanic> heya highvoltage 
[18:57:01] <nuvolari> you can always join https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-za if you want to clr_ 
[18:57:08] <nuvolari> oh hi highvoltage!
[18:57:12] <Kilos> everything
[18:57:30] <nuvolari> magellanic: yup, we try to be helpful where we can
[18:57:35] <Kilos> we all pull together
[18:57:36] <inetpro> magellanic: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LoCoFAQ
[18:57:42] <nuvolari> like oom kilos and others are active during the day
[18:58:11] <magellanic> okay cool
[18:58:45] <mazal> inetpro, we needs a link to that launchpad group on web site I think
[18:59:02] * Jacques_Stry thinks that's a good idea
[18:59:07] <Kilos> mazal  keep notes
[18:59:13] <mazal> There's no link to it that I could see , so new people might not even know about it
[18:59:16] <inetpro> mazal: you mean to the FAQ?
[18:59:32] <Padroni_> I need to speak to my broker tomorrow.  Apparently, my iPad up and died tonight
[18:59:39] <mazal> inetpro, https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-za
[18:59:41] <Kilos> ai!
[19:00:24] <captine> I can try add it to the loco sites dropdown?
[19:00:35] <Kilos> haha multitasking chair
[19:00:53] <Langjan> inetpro that process to sign the code of conduct is way over my head, why do you computer junkies get so complicated? 
[19:01:08] <mazal> captine, that be good.
[19:01:32] <inetpro> hmm... Langjan, no need to do it all now
[19:01:40] <Kilos> i needed help as well Langjan  but from here its easier
[19:01:44] <mazal> Otherwise people won't know about that group
[19:01:45] <Jacques_Stry> captine: do you need someone to make an icon for that?
[19:01:50] <nuvolari> is'nt that what a chair does oom Kilos ?
[19:01:52] <nuvolari> *isn't
[19:02:13] <Langjan> and what on earth is UCOC - sounds like someting smelly in Afrikaans 
[19:02:19] <Kilos> nono chair chairs meeting and updates stuff when at work
[19:02:26] <Kilos> lol
[19:02:29] <inetpro> I suggest you get it done though, I would say there is a bit of method in the madness
[19:02:29] <inetpro> if you really plan to get involved, that is
[19:02:35] <captine> Jacques_Stry, i didnt even realize there were icons in that menu :).  should look at detail before volunteering :)
[19:02:38] <Kilos> ubuntu code of conduct
[19:03:11] * mazal will try and do the signing procedure from tomorrow
[19:03:23] <captine> icon would be great Jacques_Stry.  I am not sure how to make one inline with the theme
[19:03:24] <Jacques_Stry> captine: I got some experience in photoshop, gimp and  inkscape so can help with that
[19:03:43] <Kilos> cool
[19:03:47] <nuvolari> ok, fair enough, I see there is no reference to UCOC any longer. There used to be :)
[19:03:48] <superfly> Jacques_Stry: it uses Font Awesome - fontawesome.io
[19:03:53] <nuvolari> http://www.ubuntu.com/about/about-ubuntu/conduct
[19:04:20] <inetpro> nuvolari: perhaps we should set up new guidelines for new members?
[19:04:23] <superfly> meh. thought I fixed that orange shadow
[19:04:47] <inetpro> superfly: I noticed your branch
[19:05:04] <Kilos> tutorial on signing the ucoc
