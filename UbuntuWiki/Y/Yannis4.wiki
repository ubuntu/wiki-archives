Hello my name is yannis, i'm french and i love ubuntu.

=== First time with Ubuntu ===

In 2004 , i bought a magazine about linux " because i'm curious " , i tried the cd Ubuntu 4.10 "Warty Warthog" and 	
I fall in love with linux. Since i followed its progress i think It's easy, secure, beautiful and the user is the master.
