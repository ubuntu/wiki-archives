=== About me ===

I'm 26 years old, living in Saint-Petersburg. Currently I work for Sun Microsystems in the NetBeans IDE installer team. I have been using Ubuntu since Hardy on my laptop and have been working on NetBeans IDE-related packages for about a year.

=== Ubuntu activity ===
I've been working on netbeans packages since 2008. I updated NetBeans IDE in Ubuntu from 6.0.1 to 6.1 and then to 6.5 version. I also maintain/update some lib packages that are required for NetBeans, i.e. libjna-java, libnb-javaparser-java etc.

The full list of packages I have updated/added can be found here: https://launchpad.net/~yulia-novozhilova/+related-software  

=== Future ===
I'm going to support and update NetBeans IDE packages and libs, fix as much bugs as I can and interact with NetBeans IDE developers and community to find out and fix upstream bugs.

In addition I'm going to improve my java packaging skills and perhaps package more java staff.
