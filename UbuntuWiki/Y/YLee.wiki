== About Me ==
I taught computer science for a while in the MS Dos days and always wanted to use Linux as soon as I heard about it. But I was reluctant to leave the windows/dos world; however, I finally installed Ubuntu sometime in Feb 2007 and totally love it. I am active on the Ubuntu forums and am a member of the Beginners Team.
