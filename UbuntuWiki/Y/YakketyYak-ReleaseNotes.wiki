Make sure you read the <nowiki>[[http://docs.openstack.org/developer/charm-guide/1610.html|OpenStack Charm Release Notes]]</nowiki> for more information about how to deploy Ubuntu !OpenStack using Juju.

==== qemu 2.6.1 ====

Qemu has been updated to the 2.6.1 release.

See the <nowiki>[[http://wiki.qemu.org/ChangeLog/2.6|Changelog]]</nowiki> for details.
This already includes a stable releases, more about that can be found at <nowiki>[[https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2016-08/msg03137.html|2.6.1 stable release]]</nowiki>.

Additionally this includes a backport to enable GPU Passthru for ppc64le.

==== DPDK 16.07 ====

Ubuntu 16.10 includes the latest release of DPDK, 16.07.

See the <nowiki>[[http://dpdk.org/doc/guides/rel_notes/release_16_07.html|Release Notes]]</nowiki> for details.

Noteworthy for DPDK application developers is that upstream deprecated the old mechanism of a combined shared library.
libdpdk.so is now a linker script referring to the - individually packaged - sub-libraries librte-*.
Furthermore the DPDK related kernel modules are now provided as dkms based packages.

==== libvirt 2.1 ====

Libvirt has been updated to version 2.1.
See the <nowiki>[[https://libvirt.org/news.html|Changelogs]]</nowiki> for details.

In order to reduce the Debian delta, the main libvirt service has been renamed to libvirtd.service. libvirt-bin.service becomes an alias to maintain backwards compatibility.

==== Open vSwitch ====

Open vSwitch has been updated to the latest release, 2.6.

See the Open vSwitch <nowiki>[[http://openvswitch.org/releases/NEWS-2.6.0|News]]</nowiki> for mroe details.

The enablement of openvswitch-switch-dpdk has changed upstream.
So if you are upgrading from a previously dpdk enabled configuration then you will need to update your enablement appropriately.
See associated Readme at /usr/share/doc/openvswitch-switch-dpdk/README.Debian for details.

==== LXD 2.4.1 ====

Ubuntu 16.10 ships with LXD 2.4.1. The main highlights for this new version of LXD are:

* Support for AppArmor profile stacking. This allows containers to load their own AppArmor profiles, further securing tasks running inside LXD containers.
* Building on the new AppArmor feature, it is now possible to install Snap packages inside LXD containers. For the time being, this is only possible with Ubuntu 16.10 containers that have the "squashfuse" package installed.
* New network management features have been added to LXD, allowing the creation and management of bridges, DHCP settings, tunnels, ... More information can be found from "lxc network help" and in the upstream <nowiki>[[https://github.com/lxc/lxd/blob/master/doc/configuration.md#network-configuration|documentation]]</nowiki>.

A full changelog can be found at: https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/news/

LXD 2.4.1 can also be tried online at: https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/try-it/

==== cloud-init ====
All of cloud-init's recent development has been brought back to 16.04,
so you've probably already used it in production!
Some recent improvements include:

* changes with systemd integration to better enforce order of boot which improve the reliability of configuring disks and network.
* bug fixes
* updated documentation on <nowiki>[[http://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/|http://cloudinit.readthedocs.io]]</nowiki>
* new format for <nowiki>[[https://git.launchpad.net/cloud-init/tree/doc/examples/cloud-config-apt.txt|configuring apt]]</nowiki>
* support for <nowiki>[[http://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/modules.html#ntp|configuring ntp]]</nowiki>
* support for <nowiki>[[http://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/modules.html#lxd|configuring lxd]]</nowiki> 2.3+.
* Improvements and support for network configuration on Digital Ocean, SmartOS, NoCloud, ConfigDrive.

==== docker 1.12.1 ====

The docker.io package has been updated to version 1.12.1.  See the associated upstream release notes: https://github.com/docker/docker/releases/tag/v1.12.1

=== Ubuntu on IBM LinuxONE and z Systems ===

There are many improvements specific to the IBM mainframe s390x architecture, in addition to all of the above mentioned features:

** s390-tools updated to 1.36.1 with support for dasd quick format
** Addition of the numactl package
** Hardware acceleration enabled in OpenSSL
** zfcpdump kernel is now available

And many other general bugfixes and improvements.

== Known issues ==

As is to be expected, with any release, there are some significant known bugs that users may run into with this release of Ubuntu 16.10.  The ones we know about at this point (and some of the workarounds), are documented here so you don't need to spend time reporting these bugs again:

=== Boot, installation and post-install ===

* Wifi shows no ap in oem end user mode, work around reboot the machine and then everything should work as expected (Bug:1633012)
* Bluetooth driver on XPS13 9434 not functioning at all (Bug:1633019)

==== PowerPC ====

** Choosing an Entire Disk install on PowerPC will result in an un-bootable system. The work around is to manually partition your hard disk and create a 1GB `ext2` /boot partition. One also needs to move `/etc/yaboot.conf` to `/boot/etc/yaboot.conf` and symlink it back. (Bug:1606089)

==== GCC ====

** We have modified GCC to by-default compile programs with <nowiki>[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position-independent_code#PIE|position independent executable support]]</nowiki>, on the amd64 and ppc64el architectures, to improve the security benefits provided by <nowiki>[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization|Address Space Layout Randomization]]</nowiki>.

  This may cause difficulty when trying to compile Linux kernels that <nowiki>[[https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/616621/|still need this patch applied.]]</nowiki>

  Other programs may experience other problems; some debugging guidelines are at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/PIE

==== AppArmor ====

** The Linux kernel recently changed how executables are run. AppArmor
  profiles that were developed on previous versions of the Linux kernel may
  require modification to allow the programs to work.

  Error messages will be logged (to dmesg or to auditd, if that is installed) that look like this:

<code>... apparmor="DENIED" operation="file_mmap" ... profile="/usr/sbin/tcpdump" name="/usr/sbin/tcpdump" ... requested_mask="m" denied_mask="m" ...</code>

  Often the profile and the name will match but this is not required.

  The aa-logprof program from the apparmor-utils package can interactively prompt the user for previously-logged AppArmor messages. To run it, use `sudo aa-logprof`.

=== Desktop ===

** GTK+ 3.20 requires theme developers to make changes to their themes. Many (but not all) popular themes are now compatible with GTK+ 3.20.
** Unity 8 session sometimes locks up when you press Print Screen (Bug:1525285)
** Unity 8 session locks up when you press media meta keys such as play/pause. (Bug:1633046)
** Unity 8 Web Browser has no sound. (Bug:1632620)
