== About Ye Min ==

Hello! I am Ye Min Phyo from Myanmar who crazy about Ubuntu. I am Buddhist. 

I am currently a ''' <nowiki>[[http://uit.edu.mm|UIT (University of Information Technology, Yangon)]]</nowiki> ''' Student. 
I have a strong interest in computers, especially Networking and server administration. 

I started to use Linux in 2013. I have lots of trouble when I start use. After meet with <nowiki>[[MyanmarTeam|Ubuntu Myanamar LoCo Team]]</nowiki>, I migrated to Ubuntu and joined with LoCo Team.

Our local community team helps me to know more about Ubuntu. I love to use Ubuntu and love to share my experiences for the other beginners who want to use Ubuntu. And now, I am volunteering in Ubuntu Myanmar LoCo Team.
