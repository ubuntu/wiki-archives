==== Who am I? ====

I have been used linux for more than 8 years. My first linux distribution is Redhat 6.2. I learnt the basic stuffs from this distribution. Later, I have continued to use different versions of Redhat and Fedora. Moreover, I have tried different linux distributions, like Suse, Slackware, Debian. Currently, I am enjoying my Debian Sarge Server and Ubuntu Desktop.

My interesets on Linux development include IM with voice and video support, wireless and Xen. I look forward to discussing the issues with you all.

==== Direction in Ubuntu ====

I wish to involve more in Ubuntu project including bug-reporting and package-development.
