=== About Me ===
I am currently developing/theming/managing PHP based CMS systems primarily Wordpress/Joomla/Drupal.  I presently reside in New Jersey, USA.

=== Contributions ===
I'm just getting started in learning how to contribute. Hoping to join the fun (bug tracking/documentation/testing/development...) for packages whose software I develop with (Wordpress/Joomla/Drupal currently). For example, I would like to learn how to develop plugin and theme packages for these systems (or convert existing ones into packages).
