=== About me ===

Ok, well my name is Yvan Pierre, I live in the twin island state of Trinidad and Tobago and enjoy computers a lot. Well my first and only computer is an Inspiron 1501 that i got for my birthday. It came with Vista Basic preinstalled. I used that for about a year until continuous system crashes lead me to ubuntu. I have been using ubuntu since February, 2009, and have learned quite a lot. I spend most of my computer time, programming in python and helping out at the forums. I also love to play Urban Terror way too much. 

At the moment I am studying for the CXC examination at Fatima College and have a bright future in medicine. I do extremely well in school and hope to get a scholarship so as to further my studies abroad, preferably USA.

Well bottom line, I'm just a little kid that craves the hype of open source exploration :)
