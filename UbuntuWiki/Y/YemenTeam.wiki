== Introduction ==

This page is home to the Ubuntu Yemeni LoCo team page.  This page helps to give insight and distribute information regarding all Ubuntu related issues locally.  We are here to show how this distribution of linux is a key player in the IT market for both personal and professional use.  Everyone involved in the LoCo has equal opportunity towards the development of GNU/Linux in Yemen.  You are an ambassador to help and assist in the migration towards open source technologies.

 Our goal as a team is to market the abilities of Ubuntu as a powerful operating system and help people integrate the technology and/or migrating from other operating systems and technologies into this one as a more advanced and beneficial advantage. We conduct frequent training on how to use Linux, showcasing its ease of use.  We also organize installation festivals whenever possible.

== Contact ==

 We can be contacted any time through:
 {*} Mailing list: <nowiki>[[mailto:ubuntu-ye@lists.launchpad.net|mailing list]]</nowiki> 

 {*} IRC channel: irc://irc.freenode.net/ubuntu-ye OR in your favorite IRC client /server irc.freenode.net and /join #ubuntu-ye channel. You can access it through the web interface http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=ubuntu-ye

 {*} You may also contact admin: admin@liioiil.com, ttmtt-team@hotmail.com (HardDisk IRC Channel Operator) for any help.

== Projects ==

 Our tasks currently include introducing GNU/Linux, specifically Ubuntu to as many people as possible in the Yemeni community.  We will achieve this by distributing large amounts of Ubuntu master CDs.  This will cost money due to Yemeni taxes, but will help market Ubuntu here since has very few original CD's in the market.
