== Introduction ==

My name is Yosef Karo and I am a 38 y.o. single man living alone in Israel.  I am originally from the USA.  I am new to ubuntu but I really enjoy helping others so I take whatever I learn and turn around and share it with others.  I don't have any special skills, professional or otherwise.  I can't program or even read code.  But what I do have is a lot of free time, a willingness to learn new things and a desire to help others.

== Community Involvement ==

Since I just started, my community involvement has been slim.  I have started a few threads on the forums and I have replied to other threads.  When I was using wubi and testing out lucid, I found a number of bugs which I reported on launchpad and have been confirmed.  Right now, I spend most of my time on twitter.  I use tweetdeck which allows me to have four columns opened at once.  I use it to promote ubuntu, to help answer questions that arise or direct them to the forums promoting community awareness, and trying to soothe those who have become disgruntled with ubuntu.  As of today, Dec. 29, I have begun to take my first faltering steps in triaging bugs.

=== Ubuntu Beginners Team ===
 I'm just checking out the Ubuntu Beginners Team, trying to find my place in the ubuntu community.  I figure that the best place for me to start is here, helping other beginners.  Plus, I've read that the BT is a good place to start for those who want to contribute to this community.  Indeed this is true since someone there just introduced me to bug triaging.

== Future Hopes ==

I've just made contact with the LoCo community here in Israel and I hope to be able to find some small way to contribute to it (My Hebrew skills aren't so great).  I'm hoping to find a mentor to help me to learn how to triage bugs properly.
