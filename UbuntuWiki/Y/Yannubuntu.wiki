=== About Me ===

I am an enthusiastic Ubuntu user and contributor since 2007 (Gutsy).
I currently live in France. 
I can program in Bash and C, and I like to help other Ubuntu users in my spare time.
My other interests are family, friends, sports, travels.
You can write me in English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, or Japanese.

=== Future Goals ===

Time is limited, so I try to contribute as 'productively' as possible, by gathering everybody's experience/solutions/workarounds into the Wikis and the Boot-Repair application when possible, in order to avoid repeating the same thing 100x on the forums.

=== Testimonials ===

* You've been a leading contributor to the French translation of SpreadUbuntu, and do a great job finding materials to add to the marketing material repository. - <nowiki>[[edb82189]]</nowiki>

* Your application <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair|Boot-Repair]]</nowiki> was an "Ubuntu-saver" for me and lot of people where I suggested it. I see you constantly participating and helping others in <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/index.php|UbuntuForums.org]]</nowiki> to overcome and solve problems , especially in boot-issues. I believe that <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/member.php?u=485559|YannBuntu]]</nowiki> would be a valuable addition to the Ubuntu community as an Ubuntu member. - <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NikTh|NikTh]]</nowiki>
