On basis of many times experiments and improvement, introducing the latest mechanical techniques of Sweden , High Pressure Micropowder Grinding Mill, the latest industrial micro-powder grinding mill, is a new type grinding machine for producing micro-powder.

Note: When users grind the material that hardness degree is between 4 and 6, the service life of the wearing parts will be shortened.

 
High Pressure Micro-powder Grinding Mill can grind calcite, limestone, calcite, dolomite, kaolin, bentonite, talc, illite, pyrophillite, barite, meerschaum, fluorite, potash ore and other more than 200 kinds of materials that Moh's hardness is below 6, non-explosive, non-flammable minerals.

Features of High Pressure Micropowder Grinding Mill:
★ Energy-saving
★ Wide Application Range 
★ Good craftmanship
★ Powder Fineness: <6.5um~<12.5 um
★ Three-dimensional structure
★ Centralized control for the electric system, convenient to operate
