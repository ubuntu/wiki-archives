== Yetzero's Art Proposal for Ubuntu ==

=== The concepts ===

Ubuntu artwork should be:

* Soft
* Organic
* Pure (Not bloated / shiny)
* Living
* Clean
* Modern
* Light (weightless)

=== References ===
 
* Light greyscale elements: http://art.gnome.org (Look the header)
* Round, milky shapes: http://art.gnome.org/themes/splash_screens/1189
* Round, soft cursors: http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php?content=19506

=== Elements ===

* Wallpaper layout proposal (colors would be added later, using a different color palette for each release)

* New default font. Old one looks outdated. Proposals:

 As you can see, Luxi Sans looks both modern and it's least synthetic than the others.

=== Color scheme / palette ===
