=== About Me ===
I'm a 22 year old Software Engineer working in Kentucky, south of Louisville.  Currently I am a .NET developer working in a scrum environment on a network-distributed banking application.

I became enthralled with computers in 1998 when my family upgraded from an old Packard Bell (with a 2400 baud modem) to a machine cabable of full Internet access.  Within a year or two I was part of a group of friends that commonly gathered for LAN parties, which included the obligatory gaming sessions as well as introduced me to my first taste of Linux (RedHat 6.3?).

Immediately I was hooked, and have been a Linux user since.  I've traversed many distros including RedHat (6.x, 7.x), Mandrake (7.x, 8.x?), Slackware 10, SuSE 7.2, Debian, Gentoo, Ubuntu, and others.

Other computer-related interests include:
* Web-design
* Photoshop / GIMP Image editing
* Custom computer construction
* Hardware diagnosis
