=== NWU ===

NWU is my biggest contribution to Ubuntu, I guess.

Nwu means "Network wide updates for systems which use APT."

* Project site: <nowiki>[[http://cetico.org/nwu]]</nowiki>
* Project changes history: <nowiki>[[http://cetico.org/nwu/timeline?daysback=180]]</nowiki>
* Spec: [NetworkWideUpdates]

It is based on a spec written by MichaelVogt. After reading the spec, I talked to AdamConrad (infinity) and MichaelVogt (mvo) volunteering to work on it. They said "great, go go". I've been working hard on it since december/2005.

The project has walked a long path already. I dedicate many daily hours to it, as you can see in the <nowiki>[[http://cetico.org/nwu/timeline?daysback=180|commits history]]</nowiki>.

I hope it will prove itself useful and stable enough for dapper+1.

I've received a lot of support from other users and Ubuntu members and that makes me even more excited about nwu. I'm really thankful to AdamConrad, MichaelVogt, MarioMeyer, IvanKrstic and all MOTU's.

The project is hosted by Ubuntu-Br LoCoTeam, thanks to MarioMeyer's sysadmin efforts. He also has contributed a lot of code and testing time to nwu, for which I am also thankful.

=== Packages ===

* <nowiki>[[http://revu.tauware.de/details.py?upid=2238|python-sysinfo]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[http://revu.tauware.de/details.py?upid=2240|nwu-agent]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[http://revu.tauware.de/details.py?upid=2240|nwu-server]]</nowiki>

They are in revu. When they are widely tested, we'll upload them to Debian and later to Ubuntu. At least two debian developers are interested in sponsoring them.

=== Extra-Ubuntu Contributions ===

=== Python-Sysinfo ===

Python-sysinfo is an abstraction library that provides system information like current hardwares, network settings and software environment. It was originally written for <nowiki>[[https://dev.ubuntubrasil.org/trac/pycacic|PyCACIC]]</nowiki>.

nwu-agent depends on python-sysinfo.

* Project site: <nowiki>[[http://code.google.com/p/pycacic]]</nowiki>
*** In order to ease distribution, python-sysinfo is becoming a component of NWU.

==== CACIC ====

CACIC is a project lead by the Brazilian Government to provide a system that collects and analyses informations from computers in the network. It reports data like hardware setup, installed software and asset management input informations.

I've volunteered for developing an agent for GNU/Linux, initially written in Perl. After that I've moved to Brasília and now I'm working on PyCACIC, now coded in Python, as an official government GPL project.

I also host and maintaing the community wiki.

* Official site: http://www.governoeletronico.gov.br/cacic/ (pt_BR)
* Comunity wiki: http://www.cetico.org/cacic (pt_BR)
* PyCACIC trac: https://opensvn.csie.org/traccgi/pycacic/trac.cgi/wiki
* Mailing lists: http://listas.cidades.gov.br/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/

=== My ideas about Ubuntu ===

* What I like
** Based on Debian, the "universal operational system" :-).
** UbuntuServer can be a nice alternative to "Enteprise" servers supported by Oracle and other "enteprise-level" software. DB2 is already supported.
** Best Desktop I've ever experienced. It just works.
** Very welcoming to new contributors.
** The "ubuntero/ubuntu member/ubuntu motu" processes are very stimulating to applicants. And they are transparent.
** Has a growing, helpful comunity
** Short, predictable release cycle
** It's a hype, but a good, deserved hype. Probably a long standing hype, too.
* Worries
** See "Ubuntu-BR problem"
** The karma system can be used to evil things, just like in religion: define status and casts. FOSS is not religion. You cannot build a karma system that is 100% fair. Also, don't confuse the karma system with meritocracy. A mathemical equation defined karma is a bad attempt to make numbers out of merits.
 
=== Ubuntu-BR LoCo Team ===

Unfortunately, the Ubuntu Braziliam LoCo Team has seen better times. One can read a sad discussion about its problems in <nowiki>[[http://people.ubuntu.com/~fabbione/irclogs/ubuntu-meeting-2006-08-14.html|a CC meeting log]]</nowiki>.

The problems could be summarized in the following items:
(updated in 11/09/2006, on jono bacon's request)

This is my personal point of view, and I am unfortunately biased by the events, although I try not to be.

*** The Brazilian LoCo team is not as warm and friendly as it should be. Many more could be contributing and we should do something about it.
** Some members and community leaders are fighting for attention and struggling for power. These goals will probably not lead to a healthy and helpful community
*** Mario Meyer and Og Maciel are important leaders of the community, and trivial issues like "Ubuntu Brazilian Team" launchpad memberships had lead to overheated discussion and the clear creation of a schism in the community.
** MarioMeyer administers mekong, and has failed to properly share his burden with other co-admins. This favored at least one grave event of downtime, during the upgrade to Dapper. After this, the opposition to Meyer's position as the locoteam leader has increased. This oppostion was sometimes delivered in unpolite ways.
** To counterweight Meyer's public status of locoteam leader, OgMaciel proposed the creation of a CC baked hierarchy (for himself), named "Translation Team Leader". Others thought that such hierarchy, if created, should be voted.
*** IMO we should not formalize any such structure, or we would be fostering such disputes and, worse, rewaring those that engaged the struggle and helped creating the chism.
*** It would not be wise if the Community Council picked one of the sides of that personal dispute (namely by the Ubuntu Members OgMaciel and MarioMeyer), although both have done big contributions to the community. In the other hand, punishing their behaviour would obviously not solve the problem.
** I don't know what happened after that CC meeting, but things appeared to be cooled down, partially because unfortunately some locoteams members got so frustated and are not as active as before (namely, at least licio, segfault and me - nictuku).
** Maybe it's time to call everyone to a meeting and try to stablish a friendly, postive agenda, lead by other Ubuntu community leaders (preferably by the community manager, jono). What I think should be addressed in this meeting:
*** Meyer should effectively share system administration with other people, possibly with other locoteams sysadmins. They should transparently discuss what should and what should not be done with the server, and write together simple policies and best practices that should be followed by everyone. Backup is a major issue IMO. Another option is to create virtual servers, but that requires more manpower to administer that single server.
*** Who should lead the brazilian locoteam? No one, IMO. Neither Meyer nor OgMaciel should. We all admire their contributions, but pointing one of them as leader would not solve the issue. Meyer has not succeded as the team leader before, and OgMaciel seems not moderate enough.

=== Future contribution planning ===

* Contribute with the Ubuntu Server sub-project with development, support and ideas.
* Help and stimulate use of Ubuntu and Debian in the Brazilian Government
* Advocate for NWU spec approval for dapper+1
* Work hard on the aforementioned packages and send them to Debian unstable, then to Ubuntu Universe, then to Ubuntu main, then to Ubuntu server (long time support).(I believe hitting Debian first is the RightWay)
* Keep focused in nwu, but keep an eye on the general Ubuntu development and help whenever possible.
* If time is available, help with bugs in malone
* Always send back my contributions to Debian

=== Ubuntu Membership endorsement Testimonials ===

==== MarioMeyer ====

"Yves has been an active member of the BrazilianTeam. He has helped a lot in the IRC channel and development. He is distributing a lot of ubuntu love and will be advocating it in his regional FOSS install fest. He will also be helping me and the other Brazilian Members to advocate on the <nowiki>[[http://fisl.softwarelivre.org/|FISL 7.0]]</nowiki> (largest FOSS conference in Latin America). Thus I endorse 100% his application to become an Ubuntu Member." -- MarioMeyer

==== LicioFernando ====

"Yves has been working hard with the NWU for ubuntu. He has been permorming an active participation in the IRC channel as well as in lists and in the planet UbuntuBrasil.I endorse his position as new member of the ubuntu." -- LicioFernando
