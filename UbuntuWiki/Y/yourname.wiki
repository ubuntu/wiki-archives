Hi, I am Jackseen Jeyaluck.(Jacky) I am from SriLanka currently working as QA engineer at an IT Company. I like to translate Ubuntu into our Language (Tamil). We, Tamil, Most of us can't use free Operating System in SriLanka b'coz of the lack awareness . But This Ubuntu give us the chance to use Ubuntu in our language. So i used my office hour to translate Ubuntu. After translating Ubuntu, i am so happy and proud when i see my translation in Ubuntu.
I will try to translate Ubuntu into Tamil for50%.
Bye for now.
