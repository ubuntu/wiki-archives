About Me

Hello, my name is Sai Manoj Kumar Yadlapati. I've been a member of the Ubuntu community since I started using Ubuntu back after Ubuntu 10.04 was released. In the course of my learning about Ubuntu I have become involved with several teams in the Ubuntu Community and different sub-groups within those individual teams.

I especially love bug reporting.
