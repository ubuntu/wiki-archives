=== About Me ===

I am a business management consultant in Jakarta, Indonesia.

For complete CV see <nowiki>[[http://okusi.net/garydean/|Gary Dean]]</nowiki>

=== Me and Ubuntu ===

I have been using Ubuntu server/desktop continuously and exclusively since 2007.  In my office, I run a Ubuntu server, and I have an Ubuntu VPS in Singapore.  I migrated my entire office to Ubuntu two years ago, with 30 users across three branch offices.  I have set up a forum for Indonesian users of Ubuntu, called ubuntu-indonesia.com.

=== Ubuntu Membership ===

Actively promote Ubuntu on all my websites and on Facebook.
Finance and promote Seminar/Workshop for Ubuntu.

===== Complete Description of my contributions to Ubuntu =====

* I established and host the ubuntu-indonesia.com website, an Indonesian language forum started on 1st Jan 2010, now with over 14,000 registered users;
* In May this year, I produced and distributed 1,000 copies of the Ubuntu 10.04 LTS CDROM, which I give away free at my door, or mail out for the cost of mailing only;
* In May of this year, I produced 300 Ubuntu t-shirts, sold at cost to users of the ubuntu-indonesia.com forum;
* I regularly contribute to the management and programming of ubuntu-indonesia.com site;
* I regularly contribute to assist users with Ubuntu issues within the ubuntu-indonesia.com community;
* I have continuously promoted Ubuntu through some of my websites (jakchat.com forum, jawawa.net, dwibahasa.com, among others) for more than two years;
* I promote use of Ubuntu servers and desktops through example; my entire company with more than 30 users in three branches across Indonesia, uses Ubuntu exclusively, and my client base is always reminded of this.

===== My plans and ideas for Ubuntu in the near and far future =====

I plan to continue updating and contributing to the ubuntu-indonesia.com forum. For at least the next few years, I shall continue to produce Ubuntu distribution CDs targetted mainly at poorer users with slow net connections. I shall be continuing to promote user of Ubuntu to the Indonesian community generally, and to my clients specifically.
