''Let me guess... You need help, right?''

Well, rest easy my friend, because you have come to the right place!  The members of the Ubuntu Georgia LoCo know that you are going to run into something you are not sure how to do.  Afterall, learning a new system can be confusing, especially if you are coming from a totally different system such as Apple Mac OS X or Microsoft Windows.  Even if you are interested in Ubuntu and want to learn more, this page is for you.  Above you will see links that will direct you to different help topics, from migrating to your new system, to common system maintenance.  If you can't find what you're looking for here, then be sure to ask on our forums!  (See the 'Need Help' link for more information)

<pre>
This page is under construction.  It will become the new help page on our wiki.  

Thanks!

Jon
