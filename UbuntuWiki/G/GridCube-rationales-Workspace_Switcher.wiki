__TOC__

In the new panel layout we seem to be missing the Workspace Switcher applet. Missing this indicator can mean that unexperienced users find themself missing their windows by accidentally using the scroll wheel on their desktops, as no indication is present to where the active windows went.

This is particularly troublesome for touchpad users, where is very normal to accidentally use the scroll feature. This is also a problem for new users who are trying to install xubuntu for the first time, as an accidental scroll might hide the Ubiquity installer.

I propose that we reinstate the Workspace Switcher applet like it was in the previous panel layouts.
