__TOC__

I'm a student at Oberlin College.  I love mathematics and programming as well.  I've been programming since I was eight, however, it was mostly game design oriented programming.  But, I would love to help with any open source programming projects that may need my help.  If you need my help just ask.  I do web design, Java, HTML, C++, and can learn new languages relatively quickly (working on learning Lisp at the momment).  If it was necessary for me to learn a new language to help with a project I would do my best to do so.  I have my laptop dual booted with Fedora Core 4 and Windows XP (only because I need it for work my contractor's program which I need for work).  I'll probably be changing my linux to Ubuntu soon.  I need to try it out for a bit before I make my decision on it.
