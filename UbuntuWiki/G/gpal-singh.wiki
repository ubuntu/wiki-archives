About Me
 

Short Summary
 
Hi, my name is Gurvinder pal Singh and I live in Sydney, Australia. I am a security professional and I am working with one of the NSW public sector company as a security auditor. I have a long love-hate relationship with Ubuntu and can't stay away for long.

I am member of few professional bodies both locally in Australia and internationally. At this point in time I am sitting on the board of ISACA-Sydney chapter as a Director-Certification Portfolio.

This is ashort summary and I will keep on developing this as I go along and would like to understand how I can contribute the growth of Ubuntu.
