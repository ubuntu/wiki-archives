=== About me ===
Hi there. My real name is '''Rafael Gálvez-Cañero''', I'm from Spain and an IT student. I've been using linux for a few years, and Ubuntu from the very beginnig. Also I play the guitar in a music group and like to play around with linux and ''DAW'' setups.

=== What I do for Ubuntu ===
Sadly not much. I report bugs that affect my rig and this year (09) I'm ready to help testing '''UbuntuStudio''' to make a great 9.10 release.

=== Contact ===
You can reach me by mail (galvesband at gmail). I'm suscribed to UbuntuStudio-devel mailing list, also.
