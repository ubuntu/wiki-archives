__TOC__

I work on free software, and, in particular Indian-language computing related issues.
Currently, I am based at <nowiki>[[http://www.sarai.net|Sarai, CSDS]]</nowiki>, 29 Rajpur Road, New Delhi 110054, and am involved in the <nowiki>[[http://indlinux.org|IndLinux]]</nowiki> and the <nowiki>[[http://oriya.sarovar.org|Rebati]]</nowiki> projects. Rebati is an initiative for FOSS computing in Oriya, a language spoken in the Eastern part of India, while IndLinux is an umbrella organization for different language teams across the Indian sub-continent. I am also an active participant in the <nowiki>[[http://linux-delhi.org|Indian Linux User's Group, Delhi (ILUG-D)]]</nowiki>.
Besides technical work on font rendering, spellchecker, font converters, locales and sorting orders, OCR, etc., I am also involved in various ILUG-D initiatives including ones for student mentorship, and for providing support to non-profit organisation seeking to migrate to FOSS solutions.
