This is my Homepage in this wiki. I moved my historical <nowiki>[[GerfriedFuchs-MOTUApplication|MOTU application]]</nowiki> out of here to give this page a more useful content. That will have to wait a while though because I'm pretty busy usually.

Currently I'm applying for PPU rights for beep, irssi and logcheck. If you want to endorse that application, <nowiki>[[GerfriedFuchs-DeveloperApplication|please do so in this page]]</nowiki>.
