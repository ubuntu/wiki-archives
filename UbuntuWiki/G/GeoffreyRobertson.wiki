We have started our first Ubuntu Certification course at Granville TAFE Sydney Australia.  
The class is taking the form of a study group with all/many/some in the class contributing
learning materials.  We are using a moodle to organize the course.  http://gonzo.edu.au

Anyone interested in this project please contact me.
