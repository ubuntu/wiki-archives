==== Ubucon ====
Since 2007 we are running our own German speaking Ubuntu conference called Ubucon. We started with two days in 2007 and since 2008 we have a two and half day event. Every year in October from Friday midday until Sunday afternoon.
The Ubucon takes place in different cities in Germany.
In 2007 it was Krefeld, 2008 and 2009 Göttingen, 2010 and 2011 Leipzig. In 2012 we have the conference in Berlin and in the last year in Mannheim. This year the conference is in Katlenburg (17.-19. October).

==== ubuntuusers.de ====
<nowiki>[[http://ubuntuusers.de|ubuntuusers.de]]</nowiki> (in short: uu.de) is the largest german-language platform providing help and support around and for Ubuntu and its derivatives.

uu.de provides a forum for support questions of all kinds, a large, wiki-based knowledge base, a news platform called "Ikhaya". Furthermore, an IRC channel is operated. uu.de uses its own software platform called "Inyoka", which is developed by members of the uu.de team. The platform is run on dedicated servers, which are administrated by a uu.de own webteam.

uu.de completely free, available to everybody. The platform is run by a group of approx. 50 volunteers.

uu.de has currently a bit more than 150,000 registered users.

===== Forum =====
The <nowiki>[[http://forum.ubuntuuser.de|forum]]</nowiki> of uu.de is subdivided into nearly 30 subforums, whereas the vast majority of those are support forums. The forums span the full range from (pre-) installation questions over help & support forums on various type of applications (multimedia, graphics, office etc) up to advanced topics like networking, server applications etc.

===== Wiki =====
The <nowiki>[[http://wiki.ubuntuusers.de|Wiki]]</nowiki> of uu.de is one of the largest, german-language Wikis on Ubuntu, respectively Linux in general.

The Wiki currently has a bit more than 6900 pages, covering the whole range of topics, similar to the forum. Every registered member of uu.de can contribute to the Wiki, namely edit existing Wiki pages and create new ones.

===== Ikhaya =====
<nowiki>[[http://ikhaya.ubuntuusers.de|Ikhaya]]</nowiki> is a news portal, which is integrated into the uu.de platform.

Ikhaya provides news on and about Ubuntu, as well as Linux and open-source software in general. Each article released on Ikhaya is open for comments and discussion, as there is a discussion thread attached to every article. Comments can be posted by every registered user.

===== Inyoka =====
<nowiki>[[http://ubuntuusers.de/inyoka/|Inyoka]]</nowiki> is the software platform ubuntuusers.de runs on. It integrates under "one hood" the forums, the Wiki, the Ikhaya news portal as well as a planet.

Inyoka is actively developed by a group of volunteer developers, which are part of the uu.de team. The main programming language is Python. Inyoka runs on a number of dedicated servers of the uu.de project.

===== Project management =====

The project management of ubuntuusers.de permanently consists of three members elected once a year. It is the place to go for every sort of request, either from the users, other team members or from the outside. Its main task is the coordination of every team of ubuntuusers.de in collaboration with their team leaders. Thereby periodic meetings are as important as working together in a friendly way according to the ideals of Ubuntu.

===== IRC =====

Since January 2012 the ubuntuusers.de project is also an official group on the freenode IRC network. In addition to several private channels for team internal management, a public channel is available for our users and community to ask questions related to our portal: <nowiki>[[irc:--chat.freenode.net-ubuntuusers|#ubuntuusers]]</nowiki> 

For general ubuntu support, the #ubuntu-de* channels on freenode can be used. They are described in detail <nowiki>[[#ircchannels|here]]</nowiki>.

==== IRC Channels ====

The #ubuntu-de* Channels on freenode are operated by the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-de-irc-op | German IRC Loco Team]]</nowiki>. The following channels are currently available: 

* <nowiki>[[irc:--chat.freenode.net-ubuntu-de|#ubuntu-de]]</nowiki> The main support channel which is existing up to now for about seven and a half years. With an average of almost 150 users, it is a very active channel providing ubuntu related support every day. 
* <nowiki>[[irc:--chat.freenode.net-ubuntu-de-offtopic|#ubuntu-de-offtopic]]</nowiki> The offtopic channel used to get the support channel free of non-support topics and to have a place where people from the community can take part in sane, civil discussions on many kinds of topics.
* <nowiki>[[irc:--chat.freenode.net-ubuntu-de+1|#ubuntu-de+1]]</nowiki> The channel for handling support requests on non-stable versions. They usually could not be handled well in the main channel, due to the heavy changes found in them.
* <nowiki>[[irc:--chat.freenode.net-ubuntu-de-op|#ubuntu-de-op]]</nowiki> The operators channel. Users can join it in case of problems with how the channel is managed, if they want to report something or if they disagree with a decision taken by one of the operators. 

More details on channels and channel rules are available in german on the ubuntuusers wiki:

==== ubuntu Deutschland e.V. (German Ubuntu association) ====

In 2005 we have founded a German Ubuntu association to support the Ubuntu communities in Germany. 
This support means that the foundation is helping in organisational, logistical and financial objects.

==== Ubuntu German Translators ====

We are working on translations for Ubuntu as well as Upstream projects essential for Ubuntu. With our Community Team (https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-l10n-de-community) we try to get as many people into translations as possible and give everybody the opportunity to take part in translations and fix translation bugs.

In the forum on ubuntuusers.de we also try to solve problems concerning translations. Other communication methods are our Mailinglist (ubuntu-l10n-de-community@lists.launchpad.net) and our IRC (#ubuntu-de-l10n) where we hold a public meeting once every month.

With our Wiki (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuGermanTranslators) we try to collect information and provide those for everyone. There is every month one open meeting to coordinate the work of the Ubuntu German Translators.
