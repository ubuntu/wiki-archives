=== Summary ===
The Nautilus context menu is growing quite big. We should introduce a generic »actions« menu similar to KDE. All the stuff like »create archive«, »share folder« and »send to« should go there. If »nautilus-actions« had submenus we should base on it. We could then extend it further.

=== Outstanding issues ===
No official nautilus-actions packages.
nautilus-packages does not yet support sub-menus

=== Discussion ===

* '''KillerKiwi''': It would be nice if a lot of actions were added as well such as 'Print' for Ooo.org docs etc, nautilus actions is good for this as it only shows the menu item for the correct file types
