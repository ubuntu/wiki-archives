=== About Gunyoung Yoon ===
My name is Gunyoung Yoon, and I'm a software developer living in Seoul, South Korea. I'm interested in open source projects themselves and contributing to them. I started contributing to the Ubuntu Community as a Forum Master in Korea LoCo Team, in June 2014. And since 2018, I'm contributing as a Ubuntu Korea Community's Leader.
