__TOC__

== What is GeoGraph ==

GeoGraph is an educational program to visualise geographic processes using the <nowiki>[[http://www.blender.org|Blender]]</nowiki> real-time engine.

== For who is GeoGraph ==

GeoGraph can be used by geography teachers to have better possibilities of visualisation. It can help to explain complex processes by avoiding unreadable graphics.
It is also useful for pupils to repeat the learning matter at home.

== Roadmap ==

GeoGraph is currently just an idea. The first step is to create the blueprints in Launchpad and do some test work.
To realise the project it is necessary that more people participate. So feel free to contact me for questions, proposals or if you want to join the team (see "Further Information" below).

At the moment I am going to test the given possibilities with the radiation budget.
