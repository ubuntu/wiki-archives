== Become a Volunteer! ==
The Ubuntu Georgia LoCo is made up solely of volunteers, giving their spare time to help promote the use of Ubuntu in Georgia.  If you have ever considered helping, there are plenty of areas to volunteer.  It actually does not take that much time to help out, and you can work as much or as little as you like! 

=== Marketing Effort ===
If you go to any store that sells computers or software, you know that Ubuntu rarely seen.  It's all "Windows" this and "Apple" that.  You can help change that.

On the Ubuntu Georgia LoCo Marketing Team, you can create and distribute marketing material that promotes Ubuntu.  Introducing people to Ubuntu is no easy task, but it can be made much easier with user-friendly marketing material.

=== Support Effort ===
Users, especially new users, will always need support when something does not go as planned.  You can help them out and make their Ubuntu experience a better one.  You can help them out on the mailing list, the support email, and the forums.  If this sounds like something you would like to do, then the Support Team is a good fit for you.
