Here are some of my own notes.

Semester long series with the Information Management Systems Association <nowiki>[[http://imsa.sfsu.edu|IMSA]]</nowiki> group.  The plan is for a lunch time series on Linux topics approximately every other week during the Spring 2010 semester.  We will be asking speakers from the community to come present.  This will be a hands on learning series with plenty of questions and answering.
