__TOC__

=== Summary ===
Basic UI that gives a user options to turn off a computer at a specific time and date, or after a specified duration
=== History ===
This program is heavily based on GShutdown (http://gshutdown.tuxfamily.org/en/index.php).  GShutdown unfortunately doesn't support DBus methods for shutting down and logging off directly, though it must be pointed out that these features can be added through custom options.

Gpoweroff was created as a brief project to explore DBus, python, gtk and quickly.
