__TOC__

ubotu is a an automated bot in the ubuntu support <nowiki>[[InternetRelayChat|IRC]]</nowiki> channels on freenode.

ubotu is a very useful resource for frequently asked questions or advice on known issues or configurations.

ubotu is most commonly invoked with an exclamation mark and the query keyword.

For example <code>!nvidia</code> will query ubotu on the key word in nvidia. This example will return the following to the main channel conversation.

<code>To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto</code>

To stop the flow of the channel from being disrupted with this sort of information it is recommended that the output of ubotu be redirected to an individual user via a private message. This is done with the "<code>></code>" symbol

Instead of <code>!nvidia</code> or <code>!nvidia | steve</code> change the query to <code>nvidia > steve</code>

This redirection will force ubotu to send a private message to the user steve containing the respose to the !nvidia query, rather than the main channel that disrupts the flow of conversation.
