The Ubuntu team is happy to announce the first release of Ubuntu JeOS,
Ubuntu JeOS 7.10.  Pronounced "juice", Ubuntu JeOS (Just Enough
Operating System) is an efficient variant of Ubuntu configured
specifically for virtual appliances.

ISVs looking to develop virtual appliances will have a compelling
platform in Ubuntu JeOS, an OS optimised for virtualisation that greatly
reduces the complexity and maintenance overhead normally associated with
general purpose operating systems. Ubuntu JeOS Edition has been tuned to
take advantage of key performance technologies of the latest
virtualisation products from VMware. This combination of reduced size
and optimized performance ensures that Ubuntu JeOS Edition delivers a
highly efficient use of server resources in large virtual deployments.

You can read more about Ubuntu JeOS in the following press release:

Sorry to post this here but I'm unable to find the proper forum 
for reporting problems with JeOS.  I tried the image under Xen 3.0
and it wouldn't boot - a snippet from 'xm dmesg' follows:
