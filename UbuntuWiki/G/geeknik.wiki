'''Who am I?'''

To sum myself up, I am a gun owner. A patriot. An atheist. A computer geek. An avid video gamer. An Android kernel hacker. A security researcher. And a Firefox contributor. (I get paid to hack!)

I have been using Linux since 1995. When I'm online, which is quite often, I hang out on #ubuntu, #freenode and #firefox on irc.freenode.net, helping others as much as I can.

If your question is about Android, Firefox or some flavor of *nix, I can probably answer it!

I am a quick learner and if someone has a task for me, I will complete it to the best of my abilities. I am not afraid to ask for help. I'm not afraid to ask questions. I'm not afraid of trying new things. And I love to help people.

'''What have I done for Ubuntu so far?'''

Mostly advocacy and tech support. I tell everyone I know about Ubuntu and what it can do for them, how it can make their life easier and best of all, how much it doesn't cost. I've also submitted bug reports when I stumble across a bug.

'''What will I do for Ubuntu in the future?'''

I will continue advocacy, tech support and submitting bugs. I may also dive into the kernel side of things and see if I can help out on desktop systems as much as I've helped out with Android devices.

'''Recent Achievements'''

I was inducted into Google's <nowiki>[[http://www.google.com/corporate/halloffame.html | Security Hall of Fame]]</nowiki> for January-March 2011 for my part in making the Google experience and the Internet a safer place.
