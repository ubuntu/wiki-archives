== Meeting Topics ==
These are the topics to be discussed for the next meeting:  (leave your name, and create bullet points for your topics)

==== Jon Reagan ====

* '''Advocational efforts''' - New User Team lead, one of my jobs, is defined as working to bring new users to Ubuntu.  Easier said than done, I will look and discuss about reworking the focus of the LoCo for targeting the current group of available users.

* '''Cleaning up the wiki''' -  I have been nuking old pages, useless pages, and files in the attachments.  The wiki still needs work in several areas, mainly with the Help and Marketing pages, but I will discuss more about that at the meeting.

* '''2009 Schedule and Events''' - Surely a topic on many people's minds, we will be discussing the schedule of events.

* '''The Sub-Teams''' - Many of the teams are just one person.  Let's look at building them into teams with multiple people so that they can be more efficient.
