I've used many Linux distributions but always endend up compiling
or backporting many packages by myself. I'm a Debian user since
2002 and are very pleased with the half year release cycle in
Ubuntu, which helps me a lot.

==== work at ubuntu ====

searched the net for a fix for an anoying glibc bug affecting
highly threaded Java programs
<nowiki>[[http://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/show_bug.cgi?id=7897]]</nowiki>

Help with <nowiki>[[NFSv4]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[NFSv4Howto]]</nowiki>

<nowiki>[[VServer]]</nowiki> on Ubuntu 
 
==== current interests ====

* mass deployments of Ubuntu as dual boot option on our University computers
* User Management with LDAP, Kerberos
* Samba and LDAP
* NFSv4 for user home directories

==== ongoing projects ====

* unixDS - Unix Directory Services <<BR>>
 A java server that syncronizes user account properties in LDAP for posixAccounts
 Samba, Kerberos, ... (generates Samba, Kerberos .. passwords if you change your password)
** Extendable by sync-plugins that are called on changes in the Ldap tree
** Import and sync users/groups from an external (master) Ldap server (Novell NDS)
** pam_unixds library with enhanced authentication and account management

I hope to get a first release out this year.
