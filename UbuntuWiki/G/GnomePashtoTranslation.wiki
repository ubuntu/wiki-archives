=== Pashto Translation of Gnome ===

This page is for Pashto Translation Team members of Gnome Translation Project to create a list of packages which needs to be translated and the members who are translating so we don't have two translations of one package.

=== Translation Tools ===

I recommend all team members to use OmegaT for translation work which I have been using for more than a year and work completely fine.

Below is the list of packages which are translated, with their translators.
