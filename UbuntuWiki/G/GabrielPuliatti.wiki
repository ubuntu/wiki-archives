== Gabriel Puliatti ==

I am Gabriel Puliatti, student of Markhan College in Lima, Peru. I am a
relatively new member of PLUG, Peru Linux User Group, and have been
using Linux for 3 years. 

I have yet to be directly involved, but I was involved <nowiki>[[http://www.itsyn.com|itsyn]]</nowiki>
inc. while a project featuring multihead computing was being done. I
also was involved in the implementation of a VoIP network for some UNDP
LEDC countries using asterisk and running Mandrake Linux (now Mandiva.)
I am also testing Breezy Badger for bugs.

I would be interested in working mainly with alternative WMs
(fluxbox, xfce, enlightment) and translation of Ubuntu packages into
both Italian and Spanish, languages I am proficient at.

As I am only a student, I have a fairly large amount of free time,
time which could perfectly be spent helping Ubuntu. My weekends are
also free for work.
