=== About Me ===

I am a Ubuntu Admirer from Chalakkudy,Kerala,India. I am a man with a leftist perspective and I find some leftist ideas in the Ubuntu "Humanity to Others" Concept. Maybe thats why i am interested in being a part of ubuntu. Or maybe the possibilities of an Opensource world will be driving me towards Ubuntu. "A World with thoughts, thats not under someone's custody" Thats what I Believe in.

I am now 23 yrs old. Using Ubuntu since the Interpid Ibex(8.10) and Never wanted to get back to Windows. Now Interested in making some Malayalam translations of Ubuntu, Which is my Mother tongue. My next goal is being a part of Malayalam Translators Team in Launchpad. So that i can help making the "needs review" numbers to turn 0 faster.
