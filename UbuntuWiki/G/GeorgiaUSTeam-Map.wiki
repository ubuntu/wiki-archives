Where do Ubuntu users reside in Georgia?

http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msa=0&msid=102245066608691766427.00000112ef06ae925a79d&hl=en&ie=UTF8&z=7&om=1

Since the map is a Google map, you can download the map as a .kml file, and open it with Google Maps.

To add yourself to the map, simply add your address below (you can fudge it for security reasons) and your Launchpad account name.  For Example:

* Street, City, State, Zip Code - (Launchdpad Account Name)
