Hello!  I'm Gareth Evans.

I've been an avid user of Ubuntu as well as Linux in general for just about a year now, not counting a very confusing run-in with SUSE when I was about twelve.  What I really like about it is how it is so open; information is not withheld in any circumstance.

I mainly run Linux on my <nowiki>[[AcerAspire5002WLCi]]</nowiki> laptop.  As such, Ubuntu (or Linux) on laptops is quite a priority to me - especially wireless cards (I just so happen to have the mess that is a Broadcom 4318)

If you like, you can reach me by email at ggfevans at gmail dot com.
