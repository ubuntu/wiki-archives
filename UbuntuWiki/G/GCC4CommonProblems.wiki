== Common GCC 4.0 transition problems and solutions ==

This page tries to be the cental point for build failures and how to solve them in the gcc-4.0 transition. Please add all common problems (and hopefull a good solution) to this page.

=== Gettext ===

If you see failures because of gettext or intltool on 64bit architectures (amd64 or ia64) they may be caused by outdated gettext support in the source. Run the following command in the package source directory:
<pre>
gettextize -f -c 
</pre>
and follow the displayed instructions. Then rebuild the package with the updated configuration.

=== Compiling Source ===
When i try to compile something that reqiures gcc or other compilers it gives me this error message: 
checking for C++ compiler default output file name... configure: error: C++ compiler cannot create executables
Please Help. Thanks...
