=== About Me ===

I am a software engineer working on the Canonical Public Cloud (CPC) team. My job is to deliver Ubuntu to the major cloud providers. I also work at improving the overall Ubuntu experience in the cloud.

I discovered Ubuntu when my big brother showed me a pile of colorful CDs he had received by mail. It didn't take me long to install a dual boot. A few months later I swapped the grub menu entries to boot on Ubuntu by default. I couldn't remember what the year was but I do remember the <nowiki>[[http://www.peppertop.com/blog/blog_images/breezy_cover.png|CD cover]]</nowiki>, so it was probably around 2006.

I am French and I worked in the UK for a few years, I am now back to France.
