=== Project ===
* Project Name
Simpla Backup

* Project Description
My idea is originally based on David Bensimon's Home User Backup idea, and ended up with something more similar to the later idea from Rohit Saraf, a System Restore project. My idea is to create an easy to use backup solution. The user will have a simple wizard to guide them through configuring the backup to their needs. Once configured, users will be able to backup at any time, simply by clicking a button.

To keep this as simple and user-friendly as possible, I don't want to force the user to make many decisions.

==== Meet Dave ====

When Dave decides it's time to sort out a backup, after losing those photos of his girlfriend's Labrador for the third time, he opens the Simpla Backup program from the Applications menu. He sees a ''Backup now'' button, but it is grayed out. Noticing a ''Configure Backup'' button, and thinking this might be a requirement before he can use the friendly looking ''Backup now'' button, he clicks the button.

Up pops a wizard, with a friendly greeting, Dave clicks the forward button. First Dave has to select home or full system backup, the (dis)advantages of both are explained clearly to the user, as Dave does not have access to the root(Administrator) account on his machine and only wants to ensure his pictures are saved from accidental deletion, he decides to go with the home folder backup option.

Dave is a little impatient, probably because he was spoilt as a child, and clicks through a couple more screens without paying much attention, selecting the recommended options for Excluding files, and the location to save backups. Dave sticks with the recommended options, as he either doesn't care, or doesn't know what the choices mean.

He then sees a confirmation screen, leaving the ''Backup now'' option checked, he clicks on Apply. After seeing the progress bar, and how slowly it's moving, Dave heads off to watch that new episode of Doctor Who.

When Dave returns and finds the backup complete, having worked with the recommended options he selected, he sees a summary page, informing him of the size of the backup, and how long it took. Seeing a recommendation to configure a backup schedule, Dave clicks the button to schedule a backup.

Dave decides to run his backup at 7pm every Saturday, and closes the preferences dialog. Dave is satisfied for now, so clicks the Close button, and goes back to organising those new pictures he took yesterday.

==== Meet Jill ====

Jill is a more advanced user than Dave, Jill's a bit of a Linux geek, and knows what she wants to backup, so Jill stumbled onto this Simpla Backup program and decided to give it a go.

Jill starts off by clicking on ''Configure Backup'', and clicking through the summary. As Jill has access to the root account for her system, and would like to be able to restore her entire system in the case of a harddrive failure, she selects full system backup.

Jill then decides to save her backup online, entering in an SSH URL for the save location. She then decides to use custom exclude rules, so that *.mp3 files are ignored, as Jill already has her music collection saved on her Sony Ericsson phone.

Jill then reads over the confirmation page carefully, and clicks Apply. Because Jill is a bit OCD she sits and watches the progress bar for the next 20 minutes until the backup is complete. After checking the summary details, she goes on to configure a backup schedule, backing up every hour.

==== Dave - part II ====

A few weeks later, Dave has gone and hit the delete key again, Dave has his fingers crossed as he opens Simpla Backup in the hopes that the backups have worked. He clicks the Restore button, and a new window appears.

Dave sees a calendar, with all the Saturdays shown as bold, these must be the days that a backup occurred. Clicking on the last Saturday, he sees a list of files/folders, resembling his home folder. Dave checks the box next to the Photos folder, and clicks the Restore button. Dave clicks the Apply button in the confirmation dialog and is presented with a progress bar. Sitting with his fingers crossed, he waits for it to complete, once completed, he opens his home folder, and navigates to the Photos folder, and breathes a sigh of relief as he sees all his old pictures there once again.

Dave is also reminded about a tip he saw in the program, that recommended he keep the backup files on an external harddrive, and having bought one just last week, thought this would be a good time to do so. Dave plugs in his external harddrive, and launches Simpla Backup once again. Looking in the preferences, he selects his harddrive, and creates a folder called `backup` on it. Then he returns to the main screen and clicks on the ''Sync backups'' button, and sees a progress bar for 30 seconds, and then is told that all backup files have been copied to his harddrive.
 ''Technical Note'': This function will use rsync to quickly sync over any missing backup files on the external media.

==== Jill - part II ====

Jill is more cautious, and after a week, decides to test out her backups to ensure they are working. Using her fancy Gnome-Do, she hits [super]+[space] and begins typing `simpla`, hitting [Enter] to launch the program. She quickly clicks the ''Restore'' button, and up pops the restore window, lovely! Clicking on one of the previous days in the calendar, a list underneath the calendar is populated with times when backups were performed. Clicking on these times, Jill sees the files present on her system at the time of backup. Jill notes that there is a ''Select All'' button if she ever needs to restore her whole system after a harddrive failure. Satisfied that the backups are working, Jill quits the program and goes back to reading her Esperanto forums.

''Note'': I believe this restore dialog is also very user friendly. The calendar is a very familiar concept to users, with the days that a backup was done displayed in bold, the user will be able to quickly see when they done a backup, what day of the week etc. There will be buttons to ''Select All'' and ''Select None'', combined with a tree view of files/folders on their system on that day, which can be restored simply by checking the box of the files they want restored, and clicking the restore button.

''Technical Note'': Due to the transparency of Linux, if the user has done a full system backup, we will be able to restore the system just by restoring the files, thus meeting Rohit's idea.

==== Technical details ====

I will create this in Python/pyGTK using Duplicity as the backend. Duplicity will provide secure, incremental backups, and should make it easy to support online backup. I think Duplicity has advantages over other backup systems, such as rsync. For example, Duplicity will allow the user to create compressed tarballs which is more flexible than a simple rsync mirror.

Another example, the user could simply leave the backups on the harddrive, and use them as a simple snapshot style restore for deleted/modified files. This obviously wouldn't protect from harddrive failures etc. But, as Dave saw, he could also copy the backup files from the computer to an external harddrive, allowing him to use a regular scheduled backup, without worrying about having the harddrive plugged in at the right time.

I will also allow the user to schedule backups, popping up a notification when the backup is running, and allowing the user to pause or stop the backup.

If you're still reading, then hopefully you find this project interesting, as I do. If so, then please check out this rough mockup, ''here's one I made earlier''.

To see a semi-working mockup of the GUI in 10 seconds, copy&paste into a terminal (assuming you have bzr installed):
 <code>bzr branch lp:~dreamsorcerer/+junk/simpla && cd simpla && python simplabackup.py</code>

Some details demonstrated in the above example have not made their way into the mockup just yet. The ''Backup Now'' button would become enabled after the backup has been configured for the first time.

* Why did you like this idea?
I am interested in creating this backup program, as I believe it would be a good start to a full featured backup program.

I don't believe that any of the current backup solutions provide both the necessary features, and the simple, easy-to-use GUI that should be available to end users of Ubuntu, that people like my Dad and Dave can (and would) use. Current backup systems either have a too complicated GUI, or don't provide enough freedom to customise the program to the users preferences.

I currently use Spider``Oak for my backup, it provides all the features I would want, but has a confusing interface, is proprietary and has other little niggles. I hope that with continued work on this project, to implement other features such as version history, it would become a good alternative to programs like Spider``Oak.

* Give us details about the milestones for this project
## Familiarise myself with GNOME's HIG (will do this before GSoC)
## Finish off details of interface (may do this before GSoC)
## Implement backend for backup, including all options present in configuration wizard.
   . Home and full system backups (must exclude virtual directories) (1/6)
   . Exclude options (excluding files/folders using wildcards) (5/6)
1. Implement backend for restore, allowing users to view files in a backup, and restore selected files.
   . Display dates of backups in calendar (8/6)
   . Display time of backups on selected date (10/6)
   . Display tree view of files/folders in selected backup (24/6)
   . Allow selection and restoration of selected files/folders (9/7)
1. Implement backup scheduling, including notification, and pause/stop.
   . Schedule backup using cron, run backend without GUI (18/7)
   . Display notification message, add icon to notification area when scheduled backup starts. (22/7)
   . Context menu on icon to allow pause/stop of current backup. (30/7)
## Allow user to sync local backup files to an external medium. (4/8)
## Check code conforms to PEP 8
## Create documentation, UI testing/feedback 

* Why will your proposal benefit Ubuntu?
It will provide a simple, but flexible backup solution for casual and advanced users alike.

==== Final Thoughts ====
I'm aware that there are existing backup applications available, including old SoC projects, such as sbackup. Unfortunately I don't see any that provide the features and user interface required for a successful backup program. Most of the applications are too complicated and daunting for a typical user to take a second look at. There are even one or two applications with a UI that is too simple, giving the user no customisation options.

Using Duplicity as my backend, most of my work will be on the UI. Because of this it would most likely be easier to start from scratch, building from the ground up. This also means that I will be heavily focused on bringing together a UI that most users will be comfortable using with no experience. It must be something that users can use without reading the manual and without feeling intimidated or confused. It will also need to look good with the desktop, by meeting GNOME's HIG.

Everyone does their backup differently, and while it would be stupid to think that we could support everybody with one application, we should be able to provide enough customisation to fit 90% of users needs, and do this without burdening them with too much. This means that while meeting the above UI requirements I will also need to provide enough options/customisation to benefit most users, but without bothering the users who do not need these options.

I think that the above proposed project can achieve this, and succeed where previous backup programs have failed. My initial UI testing with the mockup, while rough, it did seem to work well, nobody I tested it on had any trouble working with the interface.

=== Open Source ===
I became interested in open source after I stumbled upon Linux/Ubuntu around 3 years ago. As I learned about it, I decided I wanted to be involved in this community.

Fairly recently (maybe a year ago) I started learning Python and pyGTK, and began to create a small memory training project, Peglist Trainer. The code has been rewritten a couple of times as I grew my knowledge of Python/pyGTK, and is due another small rewrite soon (so please don't judge the quality of code there :-? ).

I also very recently made a small improvement to Jono Bacon's Lernid program (pending merge), at which point I realised that I am beginning to feel comfortable programming in Python/pyGTK.

=== Availability ===
* How long will the project take? When can you begin?
I expect the proposed project to take about the 3 months required for GSoC, although I'm sure I'll spend longer adding new features after GSoC. I can begin working on this in May, by the time GSoC coding officially begins.
* How much time do you expect to dedicate to this project? (weekly)
I will spend most of my time on this project, 25+ hours weekly.
* Where will you be based during the summer?
In a house, on a street (...actually, it's in a car park...). Situated in Brighton, England.
* Do you have any commitments for the summer?
I will probably be staying at my Dad's for a week, but will be able to continue working from there with minimal disruption.

=== Other ===
* Have you ever participated in a previous GSoC?
No
* Have you applied for any other 2010 Summer of Code projects?
I will also apply for Getting Things GNOME - online integration, although this is my preferred project.
* Why did you apply for the Google Summer of Code?
I've been interested in joining the developer community around Linux/Ubuntu/GNOME for some time now, and feel that GSoC would provide a great entry to this community. Plus, getting paid means I wouldn't have to worry about money this year, so I would be able to continue contributing to the community after GSoC.
* Why did you choose Ubuntu as a mentoring organisation?
Ubuntu was the first distribution that I used, and I have enjoyed using it ever since. Even if I decide to use another distro in the future, I will still consider Ubuntu to be the best for a new user, and this is why I would want to keep developing for it, so new users get the best experience they can.
* Why do you want to participate and why should Ubuntu choose you?
I want to participate, so that I have a chance of creating something that would hopefully be very helpful to the community, and to new users of Ubuntu. You should choose me because I am passionate about creating this project, and want to see it evolve into something more powerful over the next few years, and I hope you do too.
