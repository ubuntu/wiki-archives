Ubuntu Professional, Course 1 &
2, The official training course for system administrators

Geneva, Switzerland was the setting for the pilot courses of the Ubuntu Professional, Course 1 & 2, The official training course for system administrators being 
developed by Lynux Training Sarl <nowiki>[[http://www.lynuxtraining.com]]</nowiki>.  Billy Cina, Canonical's Training Programs Manager, gathered together a diverse group of sample  students (mostly community members),and  subject matter experts to test drive the material.  The  days
were long, suggestions were fast and furious and after eight (although it seemed longer) days in a small classroom we were all satisfied that our efforts would go  along ways to creating a better final product.  (That and our brains  were really, really tired!)  Billy reported that she is hoping for an  April rollout of the courses to certified Training Partners.  Lynux  Training has been developing the course material based on their  existing LPI 101 and 102 classes and adding in the Ubuntu specific  material to address the new Ubuntu Certified Professional LPI 199 test objectives.  Part of the challenge they have taken on is trying to  overlay the new Ubuntu specific material with a distribution neutral approach by LPI in the 101 and 102 objectives.

The lucky participants in the pilot were <nowiki>[[BelindaLopez|Belinda Lopez]]</nowiki> from Texas,  
Mark Van de Borre<nowiki>[[MarkVanDenBorre|Mark Van Den Borre]]</nowiki> from Belgium, <nowiki>[[DennisKaarsemaker|Dennis Kaarsemaker]]</nowiki> from The 
Netherlands, <nowiki>[[YannHamon|Yann Hamon]]</nowiki> from France,  Berndt Schaechtele from 
Germany,  Etienne Goyer from Canonical in Montreal, Billy Cina from 
Canonical in London, and Christophe Sahut, an instructor from Lynux  Training Sarl.  During the few hours ofdown time over the weekend  Christophe took us for some sightseeing
in the French mountains.  It  was here that the rumors of an Ubuntu Boy Band World Tour began.  On  the final evening of our time together Mark and Dennis serended the  group with a wonderful version of Monty Python's "Always look on the  Bright Side of Life".  It was a great message to wrap up the pilot and keep us smiling all the way home.
