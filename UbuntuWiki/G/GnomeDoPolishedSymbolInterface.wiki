=== Summary ===

Add some spit and polish to the GNOME Do symbol interface by adding some shadows, curves, and glossiness.

=== Release Note ===

This interface is essential for our first release.

=== Rationale ===

The current symbol interface is bland and looks flat, especially when drawn on screens without transparency. By making some small stylistic changes (or large ones) we can dramatically improve the friendliness and sexiness of the symbol interface.

=== Use Cases ===

** John starts GNOME Do for the first time and begins searching. He sees a sleek interface with bodacious curves and larger-than-life icons. John thinks GNOME Do looks so fantastic that he is encouraged to use it as his primary means of interacting with his GNOME desktop environment, and because of this encouragement he becomes a master at using the symbol interface and learns the real advantage to using GNOME Do.

=== Assumptions ===

=== Design ===

First, see Apple's <nowiki>[[http://www.thinksecret.com/archives/leopard9a559/image/finder12.jpg|high-resolution 'Spaces' icon]]</nowiki>.

Second, see GNOME Do's <nowiki>[[http://davebsd.com/do/images/symbol-interface-09-26-2007.jpg|symbol interface as of 09/26/2007]]</nowiki>.

Third, see the <nowiki>[[http://davebsd.com/do/images/gnome-do-spaces-mockup.jpg|Spaces icon/Do symbol interface mockup]]</nowiki>.

Finally, implement this interface.

=== Implementation ===

Either modify existing interface code with new drawing code, or create a new window class.

==== UI Changes ====

==== Migration ====

N/A.

=== Test/Demo Plan ===
