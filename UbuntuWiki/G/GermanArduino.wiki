=== Briefly ===
I'm using Linux from 1996, having started with SuSE 5.3, trying to fight against the monopoly.

My main work is develop software with objects technology, currently using Squeak (http://www.squeak.org) and Pharo (http://www.pharo-project.org/home). Both are open source Smalltalk's.

I started using Ubuntu about several years ago, searching a more suitable Debian to install on my final customers, and now all my office machines are running Ubuntu (10.04 at the time being: June 7, 2010).
