=== Global Bug Jam ===

The GBJ is a global effort to better Ubuntu by triaging bugs so that developers will have the information they need to fix any given problem, spending more time on code and less time on communicating with bug reporters. 

Our team will be meeting in ##club-ubuntu-bugs @ irc.freenode.net.

See the GlobalBugJam page for more information about the Bug Jam.

=== Assigning Packages ===

Hundreds of bugs are <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bugs?field.status%3Alist=NEW&field.importance%3Alist=UNDECIDED&assignee_option=none&field.has_no_package=on|reported without a package]]</nowiki>, either because the reporter did not know the <nowiki>[[Bugs-FindRightPackage| how to find the correct package]]</nowiki>, or was not aware how to assign their bug to a package. Assigning a package to a bug increases the chance of it being fixed greatly by sending the bug right to the developers that can fix it. It is very easy for a new member to start here and learn how to navigate Launchpad while getting to know the community.

This is a first step on towards more advanced triaging in future events.

=== How to participate ===
Below are listed the step on how to get involved in our LoCo team.

==== Register at Launchpad ====
Launchpad is the bug tracking site for Ubuntu and a center of communication between users and developers. You will need to register in order to triage bugs. Registering is easy and very fast: <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/+login|register]]</nowiki>

==== Join our Club! ====
<nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~club-ubuntu/+join|Join our launchpad group]]</nowiki> and a ##club-ubuntu badge will appear on your profile page. :)

==== Track Your Progress ====

-------
''Note:'' In light of some new information, the <nowiki>[[5-a-day]]</nowiki> stats tracker is now obsolete. Instead, do the following:

Join the 5-a-day-participants group on Launchpad: https://launchpad.net/~5-a-day-participants/+join

Then add your Lanchpad ID under the ''Global Bug Jam - ##club-ubuntu'' group on this wiki page: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bugs/Events

If you need any assistance, feel free to ask in our IRC channel: ##club-ubuntu-bugs @irc.freenode.net

Thank you!
-------

To record how many bugs you have traiged, join <nowiki>[[5-A-Day]]</nowiki>.  Be sure to follow the instructions for the applet.

To join our team, enter the following command in a terminal:
 5-a-day --add-team club-ubuntu

Our tag for this Bug Jam is "club-ubuntu.org-GBJ09".
 5-a-day --add-tag club-ubuntu.org-GBJ09

Be sure to remove the tag when the Bug Jam is over:
 5-a-day --remove-tag club-ubuntu.org-GBJ09

To see a list of tags that you are currently using, do
 5-a-day --show-tags

''Note:'' Sometimes, even though you have done the above command, your team did not register in your bazaar branch. To fix this, first change directory into your ~/.5-a-day-$lanchpad_id directory:
 cd ~/.5-a-day-$lanchpad_id
Then execute the following commands:
 bzr add team && bzr commit && bzr push

==== Sort Bugs! ====
* <nowiki>[[Bugs-FindRightPackage| How to Assign a package to a bug]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G_AcMQbSRw&fmt=18|YouTube Video]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[http://videos.ubuntu.com/qa/assigning-packages-to-bugs.ogg|Video in ogg format]]</nowiki>

When you attach package to a bug, send the bug # to 5-a-day for tracking. If you choose to use the applet, just drag the firefox tab for the bug you want to submit and drop it on the 5-a-day icon; t will do the rest for you.

==== Get Help! ====
There is a learning curve, but the BugSquad is here to help! Join #ubuntu-bugs and ask away!
