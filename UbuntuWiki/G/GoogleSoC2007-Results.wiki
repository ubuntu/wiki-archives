=== eZoom ===

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| '''Author'''
| Kristian Lyngstøl
|-
| '''Summary'''
| '''eZoom - Composited magnification for low-vision users''' <<BR>>eZoom integrates magnification functionality for visually impaired users in the Compiz window manager which is now used by default in Ubuntu 7.10. Using the new Compiz technology yields a smoother and better performing magnifier than the previous gnome-mag. The change of technology as also opened for better usability. With magnification integrated in the default window manager it is more likely to be actively maintained and developed further in the future.

|-
| '''Summary'''
| '''In the light of cdrskin - Making cdrecording possible''' <<BR>> is an all-around project for cd-recording not only in Ubuntu, but also in upstream waters. Numerous bugs were fixed in existing cd-recording packages in Ubuntu, packages were updated to newest releases, a lot of development effort has been put into libburnia which is now much better, especially with regards to libisofs, and Gnomebaker development which more then a year ago has been resumed.

=== PyStart Teaching tool for Python ===

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| '''Author'''
| Jason Brower
|-
| '''Summary'''
| '''PyStart''' is a simple and easy to use Python Teaching tool for teachers.  Teachers can create lessons on Python Programming for students and the students can submit the assignment.  The teacher can then easily load the code and check if it meets all the requirements set by the teacher.  Pystart basic code command checking, band word checking, and vary basic string checking.  Future development includes improvements of all the previous mentioned, and the added feature of submitting code directly to the teacher with ssh, ftp, and other protocals.  An additional feature will be proper test taking with powerful restrictions to prevent cheating.  Currently, PyStart works with basic support, but code cleanup is in place.

|-
| '''Author'''
| Krzysztof Lichota
|-
| '''Summary'''
| '''Automatic boot and application prefetching - speeding up application startup and system boot through file prefetching''' <<BR>> Prefetching files during application startup and system boot can speed the process up (see <nowiki>[[http://code.google.com/p/prefetch/wiki/Soc2007Progress|summary of results]]</nowiki>).  This prefetching implementation is completely automatic and adapts to changes in the system, without need for any user intervention.

=== GDebi Package Installer & Restricted Drivers Manager for KDE ===

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| '''Author'''
| MartinBöhm
|-
| '''Summary'''
| The goal was to port some (I have managed two) applications from Python/GTK to Python/KDE3 - from Ubuntu to Kubuntu. Precisely said, I have built a common, UI-independent core to the applications and the UI dependent classes. Translations and most of the logic would be shared between the GTK/KDE applications. The common core also allows for bugs to be fixed in both components.

| '''GNota is a GTK+ teachers gradebook application.''' <<BR>> GNota can deal with various scoresystems (such as American Letters and American Extended Letters scoresystems, Pass/Fail, percentage, 0-10 scoresystems and users can create their own scoresystems). GNota serves as a basic repository for student personal data (phone number for emergencies, behavioral and acadamic problems etc) and can calculate end-of-period overall grades using various averaging alogorithms (simple average, simple average of best N scores, weighted averages). GNota can also import and export gradebooks from/to spreadsheets and is compatible with MS Excel  and OpenOffice.

=== LDAP out-of-the-box ===

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| '''Author'''
| Patrick Clancy
|-
| '''Summary'''
| '''LDAP out-of-the-box''' <<BR>>  This project is the result of two other projects that were canceled during the summer of 2007.  The eventual project involved working on the authtool frontend for LDAP and Kerberos.  I thought the UI for this type of program was unacceptable, because the only information given was the title of each text entry box. I added a regular expression syntax checks and information buttons that explained the purpose of each text inquiry.  Once integrated into authtool, these features should make deploying a LDAP+Kerberos server significantly easier, and captures the idea of the original project.
