=== Improvements we could squeeze in before Gutsy release ===

==== easy ====
* Add onboard to preferred accessibility applications list.  List currently hardcoded in control center package which sucks.

* Fix accessible login button - one liner.

* Re-add checkbutton to allow ATs to work with gksudo.

==== needs decision ====
* Universal Access submenu.  Does this need to be a submenu.  It contains gnome-at-properties and gnome-accessibility-keyboard-properties.  The later can be started from the former making the submenu redundant. 

* Preferred applications button grayed out unless assistive technologies enabled - This is a nuts place to check for this as ATs that need it check and enable it themselves.  Also, onboard currently doesn't need it and gok is somewhat functional without it.

* Launching preferred ATs without logging out and in.  Could either put launchers in Universal Access submenu if we keep it or put launchers in gnome-at-properties.
