Moved to July 14.  Discussion will be continued next week.

This topic has already been covered, but if you would like to add yourself to the map, just add your launchpad name to the /Map wiki page, and we will be able to place you on the map.

==== Slight Change to the LoCo Logo ====
Nick (BoredandBlogging) has notified Clinical Mistake about the change of adding "US" to the logo, in order to not confuse Georgia (state) with Georgia (country).  Clinical Mistake has already begun work on the logo.

<pre>
<JonReagan> alrighty then... the first topic is Ubuntu box locations
<JonReagan> did those who were going to ask some local stores have any luck?
<boredandblogging> heathen: ping
<boredandblogging> think heathen was supposed to ask someone right?
<JonReagan> Vision computers
<boredandblogging> there is a guy who is about to start working for canonical...
<JonReagan> really...
<JonReagan> hmmm
<boredandblogging> he was going to look into some store by him
<JonReagan> that's good
<boredandblogging> yeah, he goes by dendrobates here
<JonReagan> ahh
<boredandblogging> JonReagan: have you touched base with anyone about the boxes?
<JonReagan> no... not yet
<boredandblogging> have you gotten the CDs from me yet? my wife was supposed to mail them
<JonReagan> no... but I did get the ones from ship-it
<boredandblogging> crud, I bet they are still sitting in here car...I'll send them to you this week
<JonReagan> they made it in 2 weeks 3 days!
<JonReagan> cool
<boredandblogging> ok, so what do we need to do to get them out?
<JonReagan> did everyone get the attachment that I sent out in the email?
<JonReagan> sry... basically we need to make a list of "targets" to go after
<boredandblogging> didn't realize there was an attachment
<endperform> just now noticed that myself
<JonReagan> oh... I probably should have made a bigger note about that
<boredandblogging> we might want to add some coffee stores as well
<JonReagan> I would have... starbucks has something like 230 locations just in Georgia
<boredandblogging> lol, right
<boredandblogging> I was thinking of smaller places
<jchase> yeah, I did get the attachment
<JonReagan> smaller?
<boredandblogging> not necessarily franchises
<JonReagan> ahhh... maybe like smaller computer shops, ect.
<boredandblogging> i don't know either way, would a starbucks be more open or a single stand alone store?
<boredandblogging> so is the next stop just giving these stores a call and talking to them?
<JonReagan> It's hard to say... I haven't been to any coffee places in over a year now, so I wouldn't know
<JonReagan> right
<JonReagan> how many boxes do y'all think we should etout by say, then end of this year?
<boredandblogging> JonReagan: we should exhaust all the CDs and get more and send them out
<boredandblogging> JonReagan: you want to contact one or two stores and see how it goes?
<JonReagan> sure... which ones?
<boredandblogging> anything close to you
<endperform> I'd say let's see how many we can get out there
<boredandblogging> endperform: I agree
<JonReagan> alright... that should be pretty easy. I will try the starbucks in Snellville, and then maybe try the Borders
<boredandblogging> JonReagan: excellent

<JonReagan> next up... ALE install fest
<boredandblogging> this was completely out of the blue
<JonReagan> completely random...
<boredandblogging> i never heard anything about it before the email
<boredandblogging> and I'm a little worried because it has kind of an agenda tied to it
<JonReagan> really? what kind?
<boredandblogging> http://www.ussf2007.org/
<JonReagan> oh.... I see now...
<JonReagan> yeah. I am not really that interested now
<boredandblogging> yeah, it might have been a good opportunity, but we might just need to let this one pass by
<JonReagan> probably so
<JonReagan> that does it for the topics
<boredandblogging> ok, shall we close the meeting?
<JonReagan> alright
