__TOC__

Details about the Go yaml package were moved from to http://launchpad.net/goyaml the GitHub project page:

    https://github.com/go-yaml/yaml/tree/v1

The import path for the package was, in March 2014, '''`"gonuts.org/v1/yaml"`''', but has since been moved to '''`"gopkg.in/yaml.v1"`'''.

A newer '''`"gopkg.in/yaml.v2"`''' is now also available with an expanded API.
See http://blog.labix.org/2014/09/22/announcing-yaml-v2-for-go for more information.

=== Package ===

As of December 2014, the golang-goyaml-dev (0.0~bzr50-1) in Debian/Ubuntu repositories was packaged in January 2014 and corresponds to an older version maintained in a bzr repository on Launchpad.
