__TOC__

My name is Michael Greenwood (mjgreenwood, greenwom) I am an entry level Linux user.
I am currently running Breezy on 4 machines.  I've learned enough to help other in 
seting up wireless networks, nvidia & ati video setups.  

I'm working on creating a local Ubunutu team for Chicago with the goal of distribution od CDs and 
if any advanced users jump onboard, local support for linux converts.  As soon as I get some interest I'll start
an email distribution list.

I personnaly am also hoping to contribute Ubuntu-compliant Dual Monitor wallpaper for the Ubuntu Art team.
