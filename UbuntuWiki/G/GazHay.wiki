What do I use xUbuntu for?

Video walls, I was offered 30 imacs, sadly I could only transport 6 at the time. Thanks to xubuntu, I managed to get VLC running on some slot loading iMacs. (OSX was just to hungry to be able to run VLC on top of aqua)

See the action here :-

Xubuntu is my favourite flavour of ubuntu, because I have so many (new world) vintage macs, and they perform wonders with xubuntu. In fact, I am in the process of buying some old wallstreets to put xubuntu onto for everyday use by some engineers. 

Thanks ubuntu (xubuntu team especially) for making these macs usable everyday, rather than dust gatherers in a loft somewhere.
