=== About Me ===

I'm a retired applications developer (medical issues). My skill-set however is mostly unhelpful; relating to old 'blue dinosaurs'.

I first used GNU/Linux around 1998 but for years only used distros that contained GNU in their name (mostly Debian).  It wasn't until ~2010 that I finally tried Ubuntu.  Some thanks to Computer Bank Victoria (https://www.computerbank.org.au/), who both introduced me to Debian GNU/Linux, and then later allowed me to appreciate Ubuntu.

I joined the UWN & the Ubuntu News team for issue 425 (July 2015) as a summary writer. By issue 487 I was adding (occasional) articles to the doc for the next issue though only for Planet. At issue 502 I was finally stepped out of liferea using a browser to find & fill-the-doc preparing it for summary writers. I was sending the the summary emails by #512, and sometimes pasted to wiki for editing, running [upd/sec] scripts & sending email to editors. At issue 523 a new team started leading the UWN and I've returned to summary writer, though regularly post UWN to the fridge & social-media.

==== Fridge, Ask Ubuntu [QA-]Testing & irc ====

For the Ubuntu 17.10 freeze I started posting news to the fridge (http://fridge.ubuntu.com/).

Ask Ubuntu - https://askubuntu.com/users/469152/guiverc

QA-Testing - see http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/qatracker/reports/testers (or http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/qatracker/reports/testers/top100) but primarily cosmic/18.10 onward & x86 (inc. respins of earlier LTS releases).  

My testing concentration was Xubuntu & Lubuntu (equally as both still had i386 ISOs for cosmic, and into disco cycle), and soon was asked to apply for Lubuntu team membership, which I did. I've tried packaging but am now mostly involved with support.

I still love XFCE/Xubuntu, but the Lubuntu team asking me to join changed my focus from 50% Xubuntu, 50% Lubuntu to mostly Lubuntu.

Minor wiki edits (updates when I see them & feel equipped to update the material; usually the minimum change necessary to make it accurate and not re-writes). Some of these are on request of people on IRC, Ask Ubuntu.

I'm regularly on IRC & respond to anything I can, and also bug triage (those I can understand anyway).
