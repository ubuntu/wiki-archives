<nowiki>[[File:GroovyPlasma.png||width=800]]</nowiki>

'''Plasma 5''', the new generation of KDE's desktop has been developed to make it smoother to use while retaining the familiar setup.  The <nowiki>[[https://www.kde.org/announcements/plasma-5.19.0.php|Plasma 5.19 series]]</nowiki> is the default in this version of Kubuntu.

<nowiki>[[https://www.kde.org/announcements/plasma-5.19.0.php|Plasma 5.19]]</nowiki> has been developed to make it smoother to use while retaining the familiar setup. Kubuntu beta ships the 5th scheduled bugfix release of 5.19 (5.19.5). 

==== KDE Apps updates, including 20.08.1 release service and other updated apps ====

<nowiki>[[File:GroovyApps.png||width=800]]</nowiki>

==== Web browser and office suite ====

* <nowiki>[[https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/81.0/releasenotes/|Firefox 81]]</nowiki> is the default browser 
* <nowiki>[[https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/ReleaseNotes/7.0|LibreOffice 7.0]]</nowiki> is provided by default in the full installation.

==== Qt ====

Kubuntu 20.04 Beta ships with Qt 5.14.2

=== Other new and updated applications ===
* Elisa 20.08.1 music player is now the default, replacing cantata.
* latte-dock is updated to 0.9.10
* <nowiki>[[https://kdeconnect.kde.org|KDEConnect is updated to 20.08.1]]</nowiki>
* Krita is updated to  4.3.0
* Kdevelop is updated to 5.5.2

== Other highlights/notes ==

=== Plasma Wayland session ===

* A Plasma Wayland session can be added by installing the package '''plasma-workspace-wayland''', '''but is not supported'''. This will add a  Plasma (wayland) session option at the login scree. Users needing a stable desktop experience should select the normal 'Plasma' (without Wayland) option at login.

=== KDE4 and Qt4 support removed ===

All KDE4 and Qt4 libraries and applications have been removed starting with the 20.04 archive, and are therefore not supported.

== Known issues ==

=== Installer and live session ===

* (Bug:1870018) Ubuntu now defaults to checking the integrity of the medium in use when booting into live sessions. This can be skipped by hitting Ctrl-C, but due to a bug the message that tells you to hit this key is not shown in some flavours.

* (Bug:1681144) Clicking on URLs in Kubuntu Installer Slideshow does nothing
* (Bug:1681830) Ubiquity installer - No Label shown for where to enter LVM Encryption Passwords fields
* (Bug:1706859) Auto-selected keyboard layout no longer matches chosen region on "Where are you" page

==== ZFS on root installer support ====

This was not implemented for the KDE front-end to the Ubiquity installer.
