=== Background ===

I am currently a student, pursuing BCA (Bachelor Of Computer Applications) from Indraprastha University, Delhi.
I've been using Linux since 2005, but started using it seriously since 2006. My first 'serious' Linux distro was (of course) Ubuntu.
I am a pure techie and I love helping out other people; I always try my best to solve people's problems (tech related of course).
As a student of computers, I know several programming languages; I'm well equipped with: C/C++, Perl, PHP and Bash. Other languages (that I'm not an expert of, but I can say that I know them) are: Java and Python.

I'm also a web developer/designer and I know a fair amount of HTML and CSS.

=== IRC Information ===

I've been IRC'ing for almost 4 years now (since 2006). And I've known a lot of people in all these years...the network that I'm mostly active is <nowiki>[[http://www.undernet.org/|Undernet]]</nowiki> and you can find me in channels <nowiki>[[http://www.ircbeginner.com/|#beginner]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[http://www.translatechannel.org/|#translate]]</nowiki>.
I'm also active in Freenode, but mostly in #ubuntu, #kubuntu-devel, #kubuntu and #ubuntu-doc

=== Skills ===

I'm a self-proclaimed artist...
I love to tinker with graphics software and make some random things in it.
I like making banners, logo's, wallpapers and stuff's, just for fun :)

=== Involvement ===

* Helping out users in the Ubuntu forums.
* I'm helping the doc's team with writing Kubuntu documentation for Lucid.
* I have also written some guides and tutorials on my <nowiki>[[http://kbhaskar.in/|blog]]</nowiki> about Ubuntu and Linux in general.

=== Future Ideas for Ubuntu ===

* Organizing more events related to Ubuntu and FOSS.
* Joining more projects related to Ubuntu and contributing to them.
* Helping on the forums and IRC has always been a great experience and also it's fun, so I'd continue doing that as long as I can.
* Programming is my favorite pastime and in the future, I would love to take some time off and help existing projects.

Cheers :)
