=== The Announcement ===

Announcing the beginning of Ubuntu's Next Release: "Hoary Hedgehog"
 
In the past few weeks, users who have been following the mailing lists have
heard developers saying "no" to the introduction of new features with
comments like, "we'll put that on the list for Hoary." The Ubuntu
development team is pleased to announce that, while still in an immature
stage, "Hoary" has arrived.

With Ubuntu 4.10 'Warty Warthog' safely and successfully out the door, the
Ubuntu developers have begun doing work on our next release, codenamed the
'Hoary Hedgehog.' With our six-month release schedule, it is due to be
released in April of 2005.

For those of you who have missed the daily churn of new packages, Hoary is
for you.  It will include daily updates from Debian's development branch
(sid), with Ubuntu additions and customizations where appropriate.  For the
next six months, it is within Hoary that Ubuntu development will be taking
place and where the latest version of Ubuntu packages will always be
available.

PLEASE NOTE: While up-to-date, this development snapshot is not (and not
meant to be) a stable distribution. Bugs and breakage, while they will be
kept under control wherever possible, are a reality in such a system.
Pre-release versions of Hoary are '''not''' encouraged for anyone needing a
stable system or anyone without who is not comfortable running into
occasional breakage. It '''is''' recommended for Ubuntu developers and those who
want to help in testing, reporting, and fixing bugs.

To install Hoary, you may edit your /etc/apt/sources.list configuration file
to replace all instances of 'warty' with 'hoary.' You can then go aboutupdating and upgrading to Hoary with apt, aptitude or synaptic as you would
normally.

Users who decide to upgrade to Hoary may be interested in signing up on the
Ubuntu development mailing list to track major problems and discussion in
the development process if they have not done so already. They may also be
interested submitting any bugs they find in the Ubuntu Bugzilla:

* Bugzilla: https://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/
 
Finally, there is also now a mailing list that will include details '''all''' of
the changes made in hoary (just like 'warty-changes' did for Warty). You can
subscribe to it here:
 
* http://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/hoary-changes
 
Enjoy the ride!

=== Sources.list ===

Here is what a fresh Hoary ''/etc/apt/sources.list'' would look like.

<pre>
deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu hoary main restricted
deb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu hoary main restricted

deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu hoary-security main restricted
deb-src http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu hoary-security main restricted

</pre>

Once again to use universe just uncomment it, by deleting the '''#''' marks in front of the sources.

=== Changing the locales ===

Hoary will only be using UTF-8.  As of 2004-12-22, upgrades to Hoary will automatically generate UTF-8 locales corresponding to your current locales.

If you want to change the default system locale to UTF-8, or to remove legacy locales (ISO-8859-1, etc.) once you're confident that the UTF-8 locales work, run the following command:

<pre>
bash:~$ sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales
</pre>

A friendlier migration tool is on the to-do list.

If you receive "setting locale failed" errors you may have to install the locale package. From a command line, run:
sudo apt-get install locales

FYI This is the error as reported by Ubuntu:

perl: warning: Setting locale failed.
perl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:
       LANGUAGE = "en_CA:en_GB:en_US:en",
       LC_ALL = (unset),
       LANG = "en_CA.UTF-8"
   are supported and installed on your system.
perl: warning: Falling back to the standard locale ("C").
locale: Cannot set LC_CTYPE to default locale: No such file or directory
locale: Cannot set LC_MESSAGES to default locale: No such file or directory
locale: Cannot set LC_ALL to default locale: No such file or directory

This should never be necessary as part of an upgrade to Hoary.  If you were to find that the 'locales' package is removed as part of the upgrade, then this would be a bug to be reported in Bugzilla and fixed.  The locales package is a standard part of the system, and was in Warty as well, and it should not be removed.

Note: if you have used the Backports-project, take a look at this thread: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=12174

Java packages are no longer in "deb http://jrfonseca.dyndns.org/debian/ ./" since blackdown has made debian packages available.

Message-ID: <20050223165848+0000@https://www.ubuntulinux.org>

If you have a LCD (laptop) screen you need to change the way the subpixel hinting works. Otherwise the fonts will look bad. 
1) Start a terminal
2) Run sudo dpkg-reconfigure fontconfig
3) Enable subpixel rendering and disable auto-hinting
