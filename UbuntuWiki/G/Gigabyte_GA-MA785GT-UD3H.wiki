I'm using a Gigabyte GA-MA785GT-UD3H 785G Socket AM3 motherboard. I'll add the disclaimer though that I am far from an Ubuntu or Linux expert so all I can verify is that it appears to function acceptably. I cannot say for certain that every aspect of the motherboard is tested and functions correctly.
