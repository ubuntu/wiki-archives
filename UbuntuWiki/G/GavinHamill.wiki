__TOC__

It's just me. I don't have much to say yet, but I'm a member of the ubuntu-pda group simply to bring balance. Palm is dead in Europe, and the Windows Mobile support in Ubuntu is poor. I hope to help change the latter.

I don't have a website, a blog, a MySpace page, a Facebook entry or a user on digg or delicious. Web 0.9 ftw.
