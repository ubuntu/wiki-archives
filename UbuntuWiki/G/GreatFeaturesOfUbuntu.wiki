== Introduction ==

This page is to compile a list of 10 great features of Ubuntu to be used in a flash animation which will be shown during the installation process. See <nowiki>[[UbuntuExpress/GnomeUserInterface|the spec]]</nowiki>. This page contains a list of features, with some text to accompany potential animations, and a storyboard for each feature to show the general effect of each animation. In most cases screenshots have been added to the storyboard (the screenshots have been done of the whole desktop). Where this has not been done, it is due to a breakage, and this has been noted in the relevant section.

The aim is of the animation is:<pre>
to highlight very cool features in Dapper and in Ubuntu in general. We should identify the ten coolest features, whether they are general Gnome / KDE features or Linux features or features in new versions of apps being installed, or just things that Dapper does really well, and find a nice way to illustrate each of those.}}}

== List of Features ==

=== Ubuntu is free! ===

{{{
Ubuntu is completely free software. It is free to download and use, and Ubuntu will even send you Ubuntu CDs without charge, anywhere in the world. You can share them with your friends or show off Ubuntu at a conference with these professionally packaged CDs. What's more, the code used to make Ubuntu is freely available to modify and improve. This means that Ubuntu is built on the high quality work of thousands of software developers worldwide.
</pre>

Storyboard: no idea how to animate this. Possibly through a screenshot of shipit? Or possibly with a cartoon or strip showing the classic image of Newton sitting under an apple's tree and Ubuntu's logo falling on his head; or with a flowers (daisys) field with Ubuntu CDs as their corolla.

=== Access the Internet ===

<pre>
Ubuntu includes the well-known Firefox web browser, which safely and securely gives you access to the world wide web. In this release, Firefox allows you to rearrange tabs with a simple drag and drop action. Ubuntu also includes Evolution, a comprehensive and powerful office organiser. Evolution can manage your email, calendar and contacts, and your appointments are shown on the desktop calendar.}}}

Storyboard: Show Applications/Internet menu (<nowiki>[[attachment:menu-internet.png|screenshot]]</nowiki>); launch firefox, open a few tabs (<nowiki>[[attachment:firefox.png|screenshot]]</nowiki>); Open Evolution at mail screen (<nowiki>[[attachment:evolution.png|screenshot]]</nowiki>); add some appointments and tasks, show desktop calendar (<nowiki>[[attachment:gnome-calendar.png|screenshot]]</nowiki>).

=== Create office documents ===

{{{
Use OpenOffice to create business presentations, spreadsheets and word processing documents. The new version of OpenOffice in this release includes good compatibility with Microsoft Office (TM) documents.
</pre>

Storyboard: show Applications/Office menu (<nowiki>[[attachment:menu-office.png|screenshot]]</nowiki>), and open the sample data spreadsheet (screenshot); open the sample data presentation and word processing file (screenshot).

Notes: sample data has not been fully added yet, so this may have to wait.

=== Add/Remove Applications ===

<pre>
In Ubuntu, you can install and remove software securely and simply. You can choose from hundreds of software packages built specifically for your system in the Ubuntu software catalogue, and with the click of a button Ubuntu will download them and install them. And it’s all completely free.}}}

Storyboard: Click on "Applications" menu (<nowiki>[[attachment:menu-applications.png|screenshot]]</nowiki>). Open Add/Remove Applications from that menu (<nowiki>[[attachment:gnome-app-install.png|screenshot]]</nowiki>). Expand X category and select X application, hover mouse over apply (<nowiki>[[attachment:gnome-app-install2.png|screenshot]]</nowiki>).

=== Organise files ===

{{{
Organise your work more efficiently with the Nautilus file manager and Places menu in Ubuntu. Nautilus is designed specifically with efficiency and ease of use in mind. When you add bookmarks to folders on your system in the filemanager, these appear automatically in the Places menu. The same goes for any mounted internal and external hard drives, cameras, music devices, network servers and more.}}}

Storyboard: Open Places menu (<nowiki>[[attachment:places.png|screenshot]]</nowiki>), Open nautilus and add bookmark (<nowiki>[[attachment:places2.png|screenshot]]</nowiki>), plug in camera/IPOD, reopen Places menu (<nowiki>[[attachment:places3.png|screenshot]]</nowiki>).

=== Update Your Computer Easily ===

{{{
Software updates are automatically announced with a small red icon. Ubuntu will display, review and install them easily, ensuring your software is up to date and secure.}}}

Storyboard: Hover mouse over red icon notifier (<nowiki>[[attachment:update-notifier.png|screenshot]]</nowiki>), click and enter password, select updates, hover mouse over Apply (<nowiki>[[attachment:update-manager.png|screenshot]]</nowiki>), apply changes )<nowiki>[[attachment:update-manager2.png|screenshot]]</nowiki>.

=== Translations ===

{{{
Ubuntu is available in over 40 languages, from Arabic to Xhosa. Adding languages to your system is simple with the Language Selector application. Simply tick the box by the language you require, and the languages will be downloaded and installed automatically.}}}

Storyboard: Open Language Selector from administration menu (<nowiki>[[attachment:language-selector.png|screenshot]]</nowiki>); select a new language a click apply (<nowiki>[[attachment:language-selector2.png|screenshot]]</nowiki>); Login with a different language, preferably with a funky alphabet (screenshot of desktop)

Notes: The last of these needs to be done after translations are working and merged - right now this is not done in dapper
 
=== Contribute to Translations ===

{{{
If you want to contribute to the Ubuntu effort, you can help translate the applications you use with one click.}}}

Storyboard: Open an application (nautilus), Open Help menu (<nowiki>[[attachment:launchpad-integration.png|screenshot]]</nowiki>), click "Translate This Application", browser opens (<nowiki>[[attachment:launchpad-integration2.png|screenshot]]</nowiki>).

=== Onboard Documentation ===

{{{
You can access the system documentation through the Help program. This contains guides for all the programs which come with Ubuntu. There is also the Ubuntu Desktop Guide to answer any questions about using your Ubuntu desktop, and the Ubuntu Server Guide for server-related questions. This is your first stop to begin learning about Ubuntu!}}}

Storyboard: Open System -> Help (screenshot); Click on Ubuntu Desktop Guide (screenshot; Go to Common Tasks - Music (screenshot)

Notes: Yelp is broken at the moment in Dapper (it has some strange symbols in place of a en character) so these screenshots haven't been done yet.

=== Community ===

{{{
Ubuntu also enjoys an enormous and diverse community. You can access the online documentation, ask questions on the web forums, chatrooms and mailing lists, read about community news on The Fridge, and share ideas for improving Ubuntu on the Ubuntu wiki.}}}

Storyboard: Screenshot of each of the above? Open http://ubuntuforums.org in firefox (<nowiki>[[attachment:forums.png|screenshot]]</nowiki>), Open xchat-gnome and select Connect, then Ubuntu Servers (<nowiki>[[attachment:xchat-gnome.png|screenshot]]</nowiki>); open http://fridge.ubuntu.com in firefox (screenshot); open https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HelpingUbuntu in firefox (<nowiki>[[attachment:wiki.png|screenshot]]</nowiki>).

Notes: the fridge has broken tabs on firefox at the moment, so screenshot hasn't been done yet.

=== Manage and Play Music ===

{{{
The powerful Gstreamer framework means that Ubuntu supports many types of music file. With the Rhythmbox Music Player, it's easy to manage and play your music files. Rhythmbox has an easy to use music browser, searching and sorting, playlists, and supports internet radio and even your IPOD. You can even create Audio CDs from your playlists! The Serpentine Audio CD Creator gives you even more control over creating Audio CDs from your music files.
</pre>

Storyboard: Open Rhythmbox, preferably with IPOD plugged in (screenshot); Open Serpentine Audio CD Creator (<nowiki>[[attachment:serpentine.png|screenshot]]</nowiki>); open nautilus with some audio files, drag files into Serpentine window (<nowiki>[[attachment:serpentine2.png|screenshot]]</nowiki>).

'''Rationale:''' According to <nowiki>[[http://www.novell.com/coolsolutions/feature/16836.html|this]]</nowiki> survey, an itunes equivalent is the fourth most requested application by users.

=== Accessibility ===

<pre>
Ubuntu ships with a range of assistive technology applications from simple high visibility themes to screen magnifiers and screen readers for the visually impaired to keyboard enhancements and an on-screen keyboard for those with motoric difficulties. These features can be enabled from the very first boot screen.
</pre>

Storyboard: Boot screen with accessibility options (<nowiki>[[attachment:AT-boot-menu.png|screenshot]]</nowiki>), install and open screen reader (screenshot), install and open screen magnifier (screenshot).

Notes: at-spi appears to be broken at the moment on dapper so these screenshots are missing.

=== Thin Client ===

'''Rationale:''' Ubuntu has excellent and quite unique thin client support, but very few people know about it. It's one very useful way of deploying Ubuntu in a corporate environment, but right now the people who know about it best are the people using EduBuntu.

<pre>
Ubuntu can be setup to run as a thin client server. This allows you to use a fast central server for applications and files, and to use older or lower-power computers on the desktops of your users. A single server can handle the applications of up to 40 users. This greatly reduces your total management cost, as software upgrades need to happen only on the server rather than on every desktop.}}}

Storyboard: instead of using screenshots, we should develop a flash sequence that illustrates the thin client concept.

=== USB Live Boot ===

{{{
You can create an Ubuntu system on a USB stick. Boot from that USB device on any modern computer and you have a complete desktop environment ready to run! This is a great way to test Ubuntu on a new computer, or to carry a useful desktop environment and files around with you. Use it for hardware and network diagnostics, or to show Ubuntu to your friends on their computers without actually changing their software installation.
</pre>

Storyboard: again, develop a sequence which shows the idea of a USB stick booting on a computer to an Ubuntu desktop.

* Screensaver
* Evolution
* Xchat-gnome
* Rhythmbox
* Totem
* Plug in your camera, and import your photos, in one click

We should highlight some of the cool new features of Gnome 2.14:

A preliminary version of an OpenOffice Impress file can be found here: <nowiki>[[DapperExampleContent/Productivity]]</nowiki> along with an exported flash version.

== Discussion ==
Ideas by EricBelanger: 
* Although this page is supposed to show only a few of the possibilities about Ubuntu, I think Instant Messaging should be added into the "access the internet" section. As a guy who used to sell computers, a good portion of customers I met admit that they want a PC to chat with relatives, using some IM client.
* Since the target audience is newcomers (as in: people with few or no knowledge about GNU/Linux), I dont really like how the sentence reguarding GStreamer was built. My bet on this subject is: this sentence could be formed with this approach: ''reguardless what audio player the end-user will use, GSteamer is offering installed codecs to every audio player on a given installation. The final result is that no player will be left alone with only some of the codecs, since the codec handling has been "standardized" by Gstreamer.''. Of course, this isnt what I would write to end users, but you get the point- I hope :)
