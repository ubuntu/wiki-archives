__TOC__

This is the official logo that was designed for Gobuntu by  the same artist who worked on the Kubuntu and Edubuntu logos:

  <nowiki>[[File:gobuntu_side.png]]</nowiki>

It is also available in SVG format as <nowiki>[[attachment:gobuntu_side.svg]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[attachment:gobuntu_centre.svg]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[attachment:gobuntu_lozenge.svg]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[attachment:gobuntu_notext.svg]]</nowiki>

The rationale behind the design is as follows:

* the three arrows recall the "circle of three" theme that is common to all the official Ubuntu logos
* the three arrows have a "recycle" theme which describes the sharing and reuse of genuinely free software
* the green in "go" has an "environmentally friendly" aspect, as well as reminding one of the green light in a traffic light, the common phrase that "green means go".

Two variation on Mark's proposal, by F4l3:

{{http://f4l3.net/gobuntu/gobuntu_logo_fale-1.png}}

{{http://f4l3.net/gobuntu/gobuntu_logo_fale-2.png}}

{{http://f4l3.net/gobuntu/gobuntu_logo_fale-3.png}}

I know what mark said about the colous. But, in my opinion, this logo have to be coloured.

I think the arrows should be colored like this (created by david[at]ramaboo.com):

I recommending using a community-improved version of ubuntu-titling from http://betatype.com/node/19
