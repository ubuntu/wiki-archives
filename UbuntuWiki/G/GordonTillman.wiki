Email: 
I am running Ubuntu on two computers, a standard 32-bit system and an AMD-64 system.  I use chroot on the AMD-64 system to run a couple of applications, including Firefox (I need the Flash plugin) and the <nowiki>[<nowiki>[[http://www.runrev.com|Runtime Revolution]]</nowiki></nowiki>] development environment.

Lately I've been using the 64-bit system exclusively for J2EE development with the <nowiki>[<nowiki>[[http://www.netbeans.org/|Netbeans 4.1 IDE]]</nowiki></nowiki>].  It has been extremely stable.
