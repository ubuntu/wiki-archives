Quote from <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XBMC|the wikipedia article on XBMC]]</nowiki>: 
"''XBMC (formerly named "XBox Media Center") is a free and open source software cross-platform media player and media center entertainment hub software distributed under the GNU General Public License. Originally developed as Xbox Media Player for the first-generation Xbox game console in 2002, XBMC eventually became a complete graphical user interface replacement for the Xbox Dashboard, and has since been ported to also run natively under Linux, Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows operating-system.''"
