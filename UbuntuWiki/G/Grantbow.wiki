==== About ====
I first started using Unix in 1989 and have been using Linux since 1994 when I co-founded Silicon Valley Public Access Link (SV-PAL or <nowiki>[[http://www.svpal.org|www.svpal.org]]</nowiki>), a <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-Net|FreeNet]]</nowiki> for Santa Clara County that is still a self-sustaining not for profit Internet service provider (ISP) today.  While running various Linux distributions I have contributed bugs and patches to several open source software projects as I have "scratched my own itch."  I am a retired Debian Developer because packaging is not a passion of mine though I have great respect for those that do this important work.  I was a full time employee with the US branch of SuSE from 1999 to 2001.  From 2000 - 2002 I consulted directly with <nowiki>[[http://www.dougengelbart.org/|Dr. Douglas Engelbart]]</nowiki> on his <nowiki>[[http://www.dougengelbart.org/about/ohs.html|Open Hyperdocument System]]</nowiki> project.

==== Ubuntu Contributions ====

Summary: I have worked since 2008 attending and organizing events in California including release parties, global jams, Linux User Groups and OSCON. I was approved as an Ubuntu <nowiki>[[Grantbow-TestimonialsAndMembership|member]]</nowiki> in 2009. I was elected as a leader of the California team in 2012.

Detailed: Since June, 2008 I have been active with the <nowiki>[[CaliforniaTeam|California LoCo]]</nowiki>.  I have represented Ubuntu at <nowiki>[[http://www.lindependence.net/|Lindependence]]</nowiki> in Felton, CA in June 2008 and numerous Linux <nowiki>[[CaliforniaTeam-Projects-UserGroupContacts|user groups]]</nowiki> (LUGs) while handing out CDs, answering questions, participating on mail lists and in participating in LUG activities.  Due to the density of Linux activity in northern California I feel it makes sense to work with and support <nowiki>[[CaliforniaTeam-Projects-UserGroupContacts-Groups|LUG]]</nowiki> efforts.  I helped organize and/or attended <nowiki>[[CaliforniaTeam-Projects-JauntyRelease|Jaunty launch parties]]</nowiki> and was a co-organizer of our <nowiki>[[CaliforniaTeam-Projects-OSCON2009|OSCON]]</nowiki> booth.  I have worked to improve our team's <nowiki>[[CaliforniaTeam|wiki]]</nowiki> presence.  I have been working with the team to expand the ways we communicate to include <nowiki>[[http://identi.ca/ubuntucalifornia|identi.ca]]</nowiki>/<nowiki>[[http://twitter.com/ubuntu_us_ca|twitter]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[http://www.facebook.com/home.php#/group.php?gid=33733199182|Facebook]]</nowiki> with positive results. During my trip to Nairobi, Kenya I worked to build the <nowiki>[[KenyanTeam|Kenyan Team]]</nowiki>.

In San Francisco I am a director of <nowiki>[[http://www.partimus.org|partimus.org]]</nowiki> helping middle schools prepare donated computers with Linux for labs and students.

==== Present & Future Goals ====
Continue to support local user groups and the <nowiki>[[CaliforniaTeam|team]]</nowiki>.  I am always looking for ways to help promote the adoption of Ubuntu and Linux more broadly in support of <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/1|bug #1]]</nowiki>.
