__TOC__


=== Discussion Points ===
==== Logos ====
** No one likes the peach or flag.
** Justin and James will try to have additional logos for the next meeting.

==== Domains ====
** Create a team imageshack account for hosting any images.
** Website might be a good place to have general Georgia LUG information, but leave on the wiki for now.
** We have ubuntu-georgia/ubuntugeorgia.blogspot.com and ubuntugeorgia.wordpress.com if anyone is interested in blogging.
** General consensus is to do nothing with the websites for now.

==== Publicizing Georgia LoCo ====
===== CD distribution =====
** James is going to try to get access to a Lightscribe CD burner.
** Jeff has some DVD cases that we can use.

===== Newspaper articles =====
** Justin is going to try to contact someone at the Macon Telegraph and see if they will write up something about Ubuntu. Jeff was volunteered to do the same.

==== New User Team ====
** The basic point is that the average user does not want to look for answers on the wiki, forums, or IRC. There are plenty of web pages, blogs, tutorial, and video sites out there that can be helpful. Lets try to come up with a some good resources and a good presentation that newbies will not be intidimated by. We may refine the scope of this as we go along.
** Jared and Jon have volunteered for this project, so we can get moving.

==== Feisty Release Party! ====
** John is talking to CHUGALUG about having a release party.

Mar 25 14:16:25 <boredandblogging>	since some of us are here, do you guys have an opinion about the logo?
Mar 25 14:16:33 <heathen>	you know mine
Mar 25 14:16:47 <boredandblogging>	just state it here so we can log it for the meeting
Mar 25 14:17:58 <boredandblogging>	ClinicalMistake, do you have a preference?
Mar 25 14:18:47 <ClinicalMistake>	the logo on the forums?
Mar 25 14:19:16 <boredandblogging>	yeah, there is a thread on the forums about possible logos for the LoCo
Mar 25 14:19:22 <ClinicalMistake>	I'll be honest, I'm not a fan of the current design.  I've been drafting up some ideas of my own, but I'm no where near done
Mar 25 14:19:36 <ClinicalMistake>	ugh its 88 degrees out
Mar 25 14:19:36 <heathen>	i like it better without the peach.. but im not creative enough to do anything with it...
Mar 25 14:19:49 <boredandblogging>	thats fine, opinions are good
Mar 25 14:19:53 <heathen>	will gimp save svg?
Mar 25 14:20:01 <boredandblogging>	no clue
Mar 25 14:20:01 <ClinicalMistake>	I think so heathen
Mar 25 14:20:07 <heathen>	i may try to do something myself
Mar 25 14:20:11 <ClinicalMistake>	I havent really touched gimp too much
Mar 25 14:20:16 <boredandblogging>	ClinicalMistake, you want to take a stab at it?
Mar 25 14:20:22 <ClinicalMistake>	it's hard to switch from CS to GIMP
Mar 25 14:20:58 <boredandblogging>	we don't want anything complicated...
Mar 25 14:21:01 <ClinicalMistake>	hehe, I'm a step ahead of yeh ;) ive been toying with some stuff, but it's just not close to being finished
Mar 25 14:21:13 <ClinicalMistake>	I'm big into minimalism
Mar 25 14:21:19 <boredandblogging>	there is one real issue, the Ubuntu logo has to be displayed in its entirety without anything being on top of it
Mar 25 14:21:41 <ClinicalMistake>	That's one thing I haven't looked into
Mar 25 14:21:42 <heathen>	thats fine..i have an idea
Mar 25 14:21:46 <boredandblogging>	ClinicalMistake, can you try to have something by next Sunday?
Mar 25 14:21:46 <ClinicalMistake>	the rules and regulations
Mar 25 14:21:59 <boredandblogging>	heathen, you too, by next Sunday?
Mar 25 14:22:07 <ClinicalMistake>	I can have a pretty good mock up probably by then
Mar 25 14:22:14 <heathen>	i can do that
Mar 25 14:22:40 <boredandblogging>	awesome, so we'll hold off any decision till we get some more logos...
Mar 25 14:22:43 <boredandblogging>	next topic...
Mar 25 14:22:57 <boredandblogging>	domains...
Mar 25 14:23:06 <boredandblogging>	we bought a few domains...
Mar 25 14:23:10 <heathen>	dur, cd ..  thats how i move up a dir
Mar 25 14:23:27 <boredandblogging>	but we probably aren't going to use them yet, because we really have no good uses for them...
Mar 25 14:23:45 <ClinicalMistake>	yall have webhosting too?
Mar 25 14:23:50 <ClinicalMistake>	or just a domain?
Mar 25 14:24:12 <boredandblogging>	the more or less official line seems to be to that we should try to keep everything on the wiki till we get approved as a LoCo...
Mar 25 14:24:38 <boredandblogging>	so if we find some uses for the websites before that, we can discuss it...
Mar 25 14:24:48 <boredandblogging>	ClinicalMistake, we have both
Mar 25 14:25:03 <boredandblogging>	anyone have any ideas what we could use the website for?
Mar 25 14:25:13 <heathen>	we should create a ubuntu-georgia imageshack account so that if we do a mass-install party (hey, my new house could be good for that!) we can host pics on one of the blogs
Mar 25 14:26:03 <boredandblogging>	heathen, we could definitely do that
Mar 25 14:26:07 <ClinicalMistake>	a website would be a great place to have regional information maybe
Mar 25 14:26:09 <jsvh>	I am interested in dong a launch party for Fiesty also
Mar 25 14:26:18 <jsvh>	we could documant that
Mar 25 14:26:27 <ClinicalMistake>	sort of try and find all of the LUGs in GA and have links to their sites on our site
Mar 25 14:26:29 <boredandblogging>	launch party would be great, lets talk about that in a bit...
Mar 25 14:26:33 <ClinicalMistake>	and place contact information
Mar 25 14:26:44 <heathen>	just make the password available so if we do anything anyone with pics can upload them
Mar 25 14:26:44 <boredandblogging>	ClinicalMistake, I think jsvh was going to handle that...and we could use the website for that
Mar 25 14:26:45 <ClinicalMistake>	That way people can meet local linux users
Mar 25 14:27:32 <ClinicalMistake>	In addition to that we could compile a list of steps people would take to install and links to the ubuntuforums about common various fixes
Mar 25 14:27:37 <jsvh>	yea, I am going to add a section to the wiki with LUGS
Mar 25 14:27:41 <ClinicalMistake>	involving things like java, flash, etc
Mar 25 14:28:05 <boredandblogging>	ok...there are a couple issues here...
Mar 25 14:28:14 <boredandblogging>	we should try to keep most stuff on the wiki for now...
Mar 25 14:28:15 <boredandblogging>	but...
Mar 25 14:28:31 <ClinicalMistake>	hmm I havent looked at that :D
Mar 25 14:28:31 <boredandblogging>	if we have a good reason to use the website, we can...
Mar 25 14:28:55 <boredandblogging>	its a bit tricky...
Mar 25 14:29:23 <boredandblogging>	basically till we get approved, LoCos should be spending their time on the wiki
Mar 25 14:29:36 <ClinicalMistake>	ahh
Mar 25 14:29:39 <ClinicalMistake>	I see :D
Mar 25 14:29:46 <ClinicalMistake>	well we can just move all of that to the wiki :D
Mar 25 14:29:56 <boredandblogging>	ClinicalMistake, exactly
Mar 25 14:29:56 <jsvh>	I agree bandb
Mar 25 14:30:20 <boredandblogging>	so, short of something interesting that we can provide the community that cannot be done with the wiki, lets stick to the wiki
Mar 25 14:30:56 <boredandblogging>	fyi, i've grabbed ubuntu-georgia.blogspot.com, ubuntugeorgia.blogspot.com, and ubuntugeorgia.wordpress.com...
Mar 25 14:31:11 <boredandblogging>	so if anyone feels like blogging about anything ubuntu related, its an option for us
Mar 25 14:31:32 <boredandblogging>	that we can migrate off to the website later if we want to...
Mar 25 14:31:33 <ClinicalMistake>	awesome sounds good
Mar 25 14:31:59 <boredandblogging>	ok, next topic...
Mar 25 14:32:21 <boredandblogging>	publicizing the Georgia LoCo...
Mar 25 14:32:37 <boredandblogging>	one of the biggest components of getting approved as  a LoCo is getting the word out...
Mar 25 14:33:06 <boredandblogging>	so there are a couple of initiatives being looked at...
Mar 25 14:33:25 <boredandblogging>	making CDs with nice DVD cases and instructions that we can pass around...
Mar 25 14:33:42 <boredandblogging>	nomasteryoda has a bunch of DVD cases that he will try to get to me...
Mar 25 14:34:01 <boredandblogging>	some of the LoCos have done the design work, so we can leverage that...
Mar 25 14:34:18 <boredandblogging>	does anyone want to help out with this?
Mar 25 14:34:41 <boredandblogging>	basically, it amounts to burning some ISOs and stuff instructions into DVD cases
Mar 25 14:34:52 <ClinicalMistake>	does anyone have a label maker?
Mar 25 14:34:52 <heathen>	my wife's computer has the lightscribe cdrom... we could but a nice ubuntu logo and such on... if we use lightscribe disks
Mar 25 14:35:12 <boredandblogging>	lightscribe would be awesome
Mar 25 14:35:23 <boredandblogging>	I wonder how much those CDs cost though
Mar 25 14:35:27 <jsvh>	the more professional they look the better
Mar 25 14:35:34 <heathen>	dunno, never looked into it.. :(
Mar 25 14:35:46 <boredandblogging>	ok, we can look into the cost...
Mar 25 14:36:04 <boredandblogging>	but assuming it costs too much, are labels acceptable?
Mar 25 14:36:04 <jsvh>	lightscrtibe cds are not much more expensive
Mar 25 14:36:06 <ClinicalMistake>	not much more
Mar 25 14:36:10 <heathen>	memorex 20 back... 14.99
Mar 25 14:36:10 <ClinicalMistake>	they do cost a little more
Mar 25 14:36:12 <ClinicalMistake>	but not muchj
Mar 25 14:36:16 <ClinicalMistake>	-j
Mar 25 14:36:17 <heathen>	s/back/pack
Mar 25 14:36:26 <ClinicalMistake>	yeah and if you want them now, walmart sells them
Mar 25 14:36:40 <ClinicalMistake>	I dont like advertising for them, but Ive seen them a lot there
Mar 25 14:36:43 <boredandblogging>	really? wow, ok
Mar 25 14:36:57 <heathen>	i refuse to shop at walmart... so someone else would have to do it
Mar 25 14:37:03 <ClinicalMistake>	amen :D
Mar 25 14:37:08 <boredandblogging>	then comes up the fun question...how many should we make and how do we pay for it?
Mar 25 14:37:14 <heathen>	sorry, personal stand...
Mar 25 14:37:21 <heathen>	ill chip in
Mar 25 14:37:41 <heathen>	unless it's bought from walmart... (its a long story)
Mar 25 14:37:49 <boredandblogging>	i'll buy some too...
Mar 25 14:37:52 <heathen>	they will never recieve another dime from me
Mar 25 14:38:08 <heathen>	doot!
Mar 25 14:38:11 <boredandblogging>	heathen, you might be in charge of burning these if we can do lightscribe, you ok with that?
Mar 25 14:38:15 <ClinicalMistake>	Id chip in but I have no money
Mar 25 14:38:26 <heathen>	ill talk to the wife, like i said, it's her computer
Mar 25 14:38:32 <boredandblogging>	yeah, if you are in school, don't worry about buying anything
Mar 25 14:38:52 <boredandblogging>	heathen, who wears the pants...err..nevermind, I'm married too, I know how it goes
Mar 25 14:38:57 <heathen>	lol
Mar 25 14:39:04 <heathen>	im the king of the castle!
Mar 25 14:39:11 <heathen>	..... untill she comes home..
Mar 25 14:39:16 <boredandblogging>	lol
Mar 25 14:39:22 <jsvh>	haha
Mar 25 14:39:31 <heathen>	good song along those lines
Mar 25 14:39:37 <boredandblogging>	heathen, see if you can swing it
Mar 25 14:39:42 <heathen>	crap, this is being logged too isnt it..
Mar 25 14:39:51 <boredandblogging>	heathen, yes it is
Mar 25 14:39:54 <heathen>	doh!
Mar 25 14:40:17 <boredandblogging>	ok, so we have some things to figure out with this and lets see what progress we make, and table it till next week
Mar 25 14:40:25 <heathen>	she's out with the kidlets, so ill ask whenever she comes back
Mar 25 14:40:36 <boredandblogging>	heathen, ok
Mar 25 14:40:40 <boredandblogging>	next topic...
Mar 25 14:40:45 <boredandblogging>	new user team...
Mar 25 14:40:56 *	heathen hides
Mar 25 14:41:03 <boredandblogging>	a couple of guys on the mailing list volunteered for this...
Mar 25 14:41:04 <boredandblogging>	lol
Mar 25 14:41:17 <boredandblogging>	here is my idea...and we can change it or amend it or whatever...
Mar 25 14:41:35 <boredandblogging>	basically, there are a thousand different resources for users when they start out with Ubuntu...
Mar 25 14:41:52 <boredandblogging>	lots of websites, wikis, blogs...forums and irc...
Mar 25 14:42:15 <boredandblogging>	but I don't think the average joe wants to deal with forums or irc...too geeky, too hard, whatever...
Mar 25 14:42:31 <heathen>	best help i've gotten was in #ubuntu
Mar 25 14:42:42 <heathen>	really irc is a great tool
Mar 25 14:43:07 <boredandblogging>	heathen, I agree, but most people don't want anything that isn't completely GUI click-click
Mar 25 14:43:13 <ClinicalMistake>	bingo
Mar 25 14:43:22 <ClinicalMistake>	that's sad, but very very true
Mar 25 14:43:24 <heathen>	guess i went to the opposite extreme...
Mar 25 14:43:27 <boredandblogging>	we need to someone give folks a way of finding help easily...
Mar 25 14:43:45 <heathen>	still though, gaim has irc "support" and there is xchat...
Mar 25 14:43:46 <boredandblogging>	and there are lots of resources, like tutorial sites, video sites with screencasts of installing this and that, etc, etc
Mar 25 14:44:07 <ClinicalMistake>	honestly,
Mar 25 14:44:23 <boredandblogging>	lets bring it all together in one place in a non-intimidating fashion for noobs
Mar 25 14:44:24 <ClinicalMistake>	youre best best for "converts" are highschoolers/college and people in their 20's
Mar 25 14:44:56 <boredandblogging>	ClinicalMistake, I agree, and I'll get to that in a sec...
Mar 25 14:45:20 <ClinicalMistake>	alrighty :D
Mar 25 14:45:32 <boredandblogging>	so the new user team's responsibility will be together the resources on the wiki (for now) so we can just point people to it...
Mar 25 14:45:47 <boredandblogging>	(hopefully once we get the website, we'll just point them there)
Mar 25 14:46:08 <boredandblogging>	it will probably require work as Ubuntu gets more popular and more resources pop up
Mar 25 14:46:42 <boredandblogging>	jsvh, I think this also ties in with you documenting the LUGs
Mar 25 14:47:09 <ClinicalMistake>	I could aid some in the compiling of information for new users
Mar 25 14:47:11 <boredandblogging>	if we can gather a list of Georgia LUGs and list them as resources, it would probably be helpful...
Mar 25 14:47:16 <boredandblogging>	ClinicalMistake, awesome
Mar 25 14:47:30 <ClinicalMistake>	I'm one myself so I can get together the information that I've used
Mar 25 14:47:47 <boredandblogging>	ClinicalMistake, that would be great
Mar 25 14:48:17 <boredandblogging>	i would like to keep out references to the forums, irc, and probably the wiki (it intimidates people for some reason)
Mar 25 14:48:33 <ClinicalMistake>	there arent many images in wiki's
Mar 25 14:48:41 <ClinicalMistake>	people like FAQs I think thouh
Mar 25 14:48:44 <ClinicalMistake>	though
Mar 25 14:48:57 <boredandblogging>	right, anything professional works
Mar 25 14:49:11 <boredandblogging>	thats one reason I wish we didn't have to stick to the wiki, but oh well
Mar 25 14:49:41 <jsvh>	sorry in and out, trying to set up a database. I am going to document the lugs later today
Mar 25 14:49:49 <boredandblogging>	jsvh, sounds good
Mar 25 14:50:10 <heathen>	can you not set a FAQ wiki page?
Mar 25 14:50:24 <jsvh>	Yea, I think the lug should be center for finding what ever type of support you want
Mar 25 14:50:27 <ClinicalMistake>	yeah, you can
Mar 25 14:51:10 <boredandblogging>	heathen, we can...its really about how comprehensive we want to be
Mar 25 14:51:18 <heathen>	fair enough
Mar 25 14:51:58 <boredandblogging>	so the 2 guys from the mailing list, I think I'm going to let them run with it and see
Mar 25 14:52:29 <boredandblogging>	we'll put it together with the LUG info and see what we can come up with.
Mar 25 14:52:55 <boredandblogging>	ok, done with this topic...
Mar 25 14:53:10 <boredandblogging>	actually, my mistake, I had something for the publicizing the LoCo...
Mar 25 14:53:19 <boredandblogging>	like I said before, getting the word out is a big deal for us...
Mar 25 14:53:48 <boredandblogging>	one thing we can do is get stuff about Ubuntu and the Georgia LoCo published in newspapers
Mar 25 14:53:52 <ClinicalMistake>	a lot of that should be done through LUGs yanno?
Mar 25 14:54:01 <ClinicalMistake>	if we got them active, it'd work out better
Mar 25 14:54:12 <boredandblogging>	ClinicalMistake, get what done?
Mar 25 14:54:20 <ClinicalMistake>	it's the personal interaction that's a big deal imo
Mar 25 14:54:29 <ClinicalMistake>	getting the wordout
Mar 25 14:54:47 <ClinicalMistake>	anyone can read about a loco, but when you talk to someone you know and spread it that way, it's like a virus
Mar 25 14:55:28 <boredandblogging>	absolutely, I'm thinking of the guy who really isn't quite sure and not sure where to look and get info
Mar 25 14:55:43 <heathen>	sorry to cut early, but i have to finish the lawn before i lose my ambition..
Mar 25 14:55:48 <ClinicalMistake>	~
Mar 25 14:55:50 <boredandblogging>	but once we get to interact with them, heathen's charm will take care of it all
Mar 25 14:56:20 <heathen>	ha!
Mar 25 14:56:56 <heathen>	picture larry the cable guy talking about linux... that's what it would look like
Mar 25 14:57:05 <boredandblogging>	lol
Mar 25 14:57:48 <heathen>	i suppose in linux's favor, if someone that speaks like larry can do this than it cant be that hard for the normal person
Mar 25 14:58:08 <ClinicalMistake>	:D
Mar 25 14:58:09 <boredandblogging>	ok, back to my publicizing idea...ClinicalMistake's article made me think that if we can get some stuff published, it would be good way of letting people know there is help for them out there
Mar 25 14:59:02 <boredandblogging>	heathen, you want to be a our poster boy?
Mar 25 14:59:49 <ClinicalMistake>	publishing is a great way, maybe contacting local papers
Mar 25 15:00:13 <ClinicalMistake>	though for some of yall, I dont know if Id consider the AJC local
Mar 25 15:00:24 <boredandblogging>	I thought of contacting the AJC, but they are a bunch of boobs
Mar 25 15:00:29 <ClinicalMistake>	however papers are ALWAYS looking for features, so if you can market to them that way
Mar 25 15:00:42 <ClinicalMistake>	yeah my experience with them hasn't been a good one
Mar 25 15:01:03 <boredandblogging>	and their website is hideous, all cox websites are hideous
Mar 25 15:01:41 <boredandblogging>	i'm going to see if the AJC has a tech guy that I can email...
Mar 25 15:02:06 <ClinicalMistake>	Wow shit
Mar 25 15:02:19 <ClinicalMistake>	you weren't kidding, this website is terrible
Mar 25 15:02:31 <boredandblogging>	i actually emailed the Ubuntu marketing mailing list if they had any templates or suggestions for emailing journalists, they weren't too helpful
Mar 25 15:03:44 <boredandblogging>	so it might be nice if we can come up with an email template for something like that...
Mar 25 15:04:16 <boredandblogging>	also, someone on this channel is going to work on Sakia at GT...
Mar 25 15:04:40 <ClinicalMistake>	I'd suggest letting the papers know that this could be used as a feature, it's local activity that people can participate in, that people meet in LUGs around the state (people attending meetings is a great thing to write about) and that it's something that they could easily find a lot of information about
Mar 25 15:04:49 <boredandblogging>	Sakai is an open source competitor to WebCT or Blackboard, the stuff that university use in courses.
Mar 25 15:04:56 <ClinicalMistake>	Oh nice
Mar 25 15:05:03 <ClinicalMistake>	WebCT is terrible ;_;
Mar 25 15:05:32 <jsvh>	yea it is
Mar 25 15:05:41 <boredandblogging>	hey ClinicalMistake, you wanna try calling a journalist?
Mar 25 15:05:56 <boredandblogging>	jsvh, do you remember who it was working on sakai?
Mar 25 15:06:31 <ClinicalMistake>	one from the AJC?
Mar 25 15:06:42 <jsvh>	no, I would love to know, however
Mar 25 15:06:53 <boredandblogging>	ClinicalMistake, sure, doesn't really matter, any journalist at any newspaper is fine
Mar 25 15:08:11 <ClinicalMistake>	I dont think calling the AJC would be the best idea for me (I dont live in atlanta) but I can call the Macon Telegraph
Mar 25 15:08:24 <boredandblogging>	ClinicalMistake, that would be great
Mar 25 15:08:55 *	ClinicalMistake is now known as C2
Mar 25 15:08:57 <boredandblogging>	and we can probably get nomasteryoda to call too since he is in the mlug
Mar 25 15:09:04 <C2>	huh, that's odd
Mar 25 15:09:11 <C2>	/newnick CM
Mar 25 15:10:22 <boredandblogging>	ClinicalMistake, so you think you can try contacting at the telegraph in the next couple of weeks? I'll talk to nomasteryoda about doing the same. maybe in preparation for the release of Feisty?
Mar 25 15:11:14 <C2>	i'll look into it
Mar 25 15:11:19 <boredandblogging>	thanks man
Mar 25 15:11:29 <boredandblogging>	last topic: Feisty Release Party!
Mar 25 15:11:42 <jsvh>	Yea! party!
Mar 25 15:12:13 <boredandblogging>	think it would be great if all met and hung out
Mar 25 15:12:24 <jsvh>	I am already talking with CHUGALUG here in Athens about haveing a Release party here
Mar 25 15:12:25 <boredandblogging>	and make fun of heathen, kidding kidding
Mar 25 15:12:38 <jsvh>	haha
Mar 25 15:12:42 <boredandblogging>	jsvh, are GT alums invited? ;-)
Mar 25 15:13:11 <jsvh>	ofcourse, fights make the night more interesting. haha jk
