=== Project ===

*** Project Name: RDP plugin for Vinagre
*** Project Description: I plan on figuring out the details for adding an RDP plugin to Vinagre.
*** If you would be willing and able to do other projects instead, which ones?
      I would like to do a project that involves GNOME. I am currently working with libglib for my MS Project, so something that utilizes the similar tools. I am curious about GObject and have studied it, but I have yet utilize it. 
*** Why did you like this idea?
      It looks like a project that I can stand to learn a lot, yet I won't be digging a big hole for myself. I already looked at the code for Vinagre and I see that it uses the GObject typing system. This is something that I have been curious about yet I haven't done any application. I have the book "The Official Gnome Developer's Guide" by Matthias Warkus and I have read through his record examples, yet I stlll don't have a good handle on it. I assume that by working on this project, I will be in the code and I have to potential to learn more about it.
*** Please describe a tentative project architecture or an approach to it:
      I don't know what architecture means in this case. I am thinking of libglib, gobject, and whatever other gnome libraries are out there. I use emacs, etags, and Eclipse a plan, or an objective, and then I look at what it takes to get it done.
*** Give us details about the milestones for this project
1. Browse the code
2. Look at the objective and see what areas need to be modified/developed.
3. Find the library that supports RDP. I assume that there is an RDP? I am crossing my fingers! I will check into this.
4. Learn the areas that I need to know for new development. Develop small programs verifying my understanding of new development.
5. Do the integration.
6. Test. Code. Verify. Release. Repeat as necessary.
7. Do we get our own branch?
*** Why will your proposal benefit Ubuntu?
      First, I hope that this will allow for just Vinagre being included into the Ubuntu CD. Second, I hope this will give me the guided experience to be a long term GNOME developer. (Free/libre software developer).

=== Open Source ===

*** Please describe any previous Open Source development experience
      I participated in GSOC in 2008 on the OSSIM project. I wrote an SSL/TLS to connect the different systems together. I started the bstamp project, but I haven't done much with it. And, now for my MS Project, I am collaborating with Luca Deri from NTOP integrating my rules from Genetic Algorithms into his nProbe tool. My MS project proposal originally says SNORT, but I have since changed that portion to nProbe.
*** Why are you interested in Open Source?
      Great software is built on the shoulders of others. I am a firm believer in the ideas advocated by RMS.

 
=== Availability ===

*** How long will the project take? When can you begin?
      I should be able to begin when the project begins.
*** How much time do you expect to dedicate to this project? (weekly)
      35+ hours per week.
*** Where will you based during the summer?
      Sacramento, CA . You can come visit me if you like. We have good old SacLUG here and would be happy to have guests! We are about an hour away from San Francisco!
*** Do you have any commitments for the summer? (holidays/work/summer courses)
      I work part time for the Legislative Data Center, which provides support and develops applications for the California State Legislature. I work 20 hours a week for the State of CA. I am the backup developer for an application called Committee Actions that manages the flow of information through committees. I may also spend some time on my MS project if it is not already complete. It will be second priority to this GSOC project.
       
*** Please designate a back up student (in case you need to withdraw your application)
      Do I need to find another student as a backup? I sent an email to the Graduate Coordinator at Sac State and she sent it out to all the grad students. Do I need to try to find another student at Sac State as a backup?

 
=== Other ===

*** Have you ever participated in a previous GSoC? (describe your project)
      Yes, I worked on the OSSIM project in 2008. I did the TLS/SSL between the different components. It turned out to be much more challenging as the libgnet does not provide TLS/Support. I ended up having to do a dirty hack to make it work. Since then, gnio has been developed and if it was available at the time, it would have helped. Yet, GNIO still doesn't have SSL/TLS support. It was a great learning experience. What I thought would be easy turned out to be quite a bit of work. In the end, there was still more work to be done, but I did get a good handle on it and learned where the networking is at with GNOME (between libglib, libsoup, and libgnet).
*** Have you applied for any other 2010 Summer of Code projects? If yes, which ones?
      No. this is the only one.
*** Why did you apply for the Google Summer of Code ?
      Pick a project that is not too hard that I can learn something and make some extra cash!
*** Why did you choose Ubuntu as a mentoring organisation?
      I have five Dell laptops running Ubuntu. I run Debian on my servers!
*** Why do you want to participate and why should Ubuntu choose you?
      I want to participate to learn more and make some cash. I believe this is a good project to expand my horizens. Ubuntu should choose me because I have good programming skills and I already run Ubuntu. There are a few infrastructure areas that I need to still build upon. I hope through this mentoring process, it will give me the foundation to become a long term hacker and contributor to GNOME and make Ubuntu better. I believe that this Vinagre will be a small brick in the foundation to continue the development to building a great Ubuntu.
