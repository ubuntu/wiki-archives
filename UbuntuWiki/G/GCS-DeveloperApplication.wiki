== Who I am ==
''Tell us a bit about yourself.''

== My Ubuntu story ==
''Tell us how and when you got involved, what you liked working on and what you could probably do better.''

=== My involvement ===
=== Examples of my work / Things I'm proud of ===
=== Areas of work ===
''I'm a Debian Developer since 2005 and have packages of a wide range. I packaged a console CD writing program, cdw; an embeddable console SQL program, SQLite; through Commodore emulators, VICE; a flexible logging server, syslog-ng; to a distributed filesystem, CEPH.''
''I've close relation with upstream of syslog-ng and CEPH. I can use it to take advantage for packaging and fixing bugs for Debian and Ubuntu; perhaps quickier than an outsider would or could do.''
