=== Project ideas ===

Students: Please read our <nowiki>[[SummerOfCode-Students|advice for students]]</nowiki> in addition to the ideas on this page. Remember, these are just suggestions! If your favourite idea isn't here, don't worry. You are welcome to use your own project idea when you submit your student application. Of course, it is a good idea to look around and find someone who would be interested in mentoring your project. Perhaps someone is offering to mentor a similar project?

Can you think of a nice project for a student to work on over the summer? Is it best achieved here in Ubuntu? Great! Go ahead and add it to this list. When adding a project idea…
* Try to explain your idea quickly. If you need more words, consider linking to another wiki page.
* Make sure your idea is understandable for someone who is new to Ubuntu development.
* If you are interested in mentoring that idea, please leave your name with the project, and in the table at the top of this page, so potential students can contact you.
* Please use the following format and add your idea to the top of the list:
   <pre>
==== Project name ====
* '''Suggested by:''' YourName (linking to your personal wiki page or your Launchpad profile).
* '''Mentors:''' List anyone interested in mentoring the project.
