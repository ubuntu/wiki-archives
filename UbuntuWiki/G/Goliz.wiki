Hi everybody !

I started playing with Linux some years ago but I'm really fully using Linux at home since feb. 2005.
I've installed Suse, Mandrake and Mandriva distributions until I discovered Ubuntu.
I felt myself more comfortable with the Ubuntu approach (philosophy ?) and I decided in decembrer 2005 to switch to Breezy Badger...

As my portable PC is a old one (PIII 300, 6 Gb, 192 Mb Ram) if choosed to install a  base "server" version with XFCE windows manager.
It works almost perfectly now and I'm quite happy with !
