__TOC__

This is the name of a project in the Minneapolis public schools (Fall, 2008). It involves at this point 4 science classrooms: a middle school classroom on the North Side and three science classrooms at Roosevelt high school.

The, growing communities of scientist project involves three main components:
1. a physical infrastructure using special, 4-person tables where the computer displays are viewed through the glass tabletop. This setup is described in more detail on this page: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ComputerEnabledScienceClassroom and the project is described on this blog: http://groosd.blogspot.com
2. a software and hardware infrastructure based on an Ubuntu thin client network in each classroom
3. a pedagogy which takes advantage of the network resources while still focusing on hands-on science experience.

Information about the second component, the hardware and software, will be expanded upon here in this wiki, opening the door to teachers and others who are interested in building upon what is documented here.  Please also see: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MinnesotaTeam/Education
