=== About Me ===
Hi, I am Gaurav. I am 23 years old and I am from India-Mumbai. I also work at Tata Consultancy Services as System Engineer in Linux, C++, Java, Perl and Shell. As a client of TCS, I am serving Ericsson for last few years in CDMA technology.

First time I got introduced to computer when I was 13 years old. I wrote a simple DOS program and found it very interesting. Then I completed by graduation as Computer Engineer from University of Mumbai.

I like coding, learning new development technologies. and I love computer games and photography.

=== Me and Linux ===

I am using Linux since last 7 years. I have used Redhat Linux, Mac, Sun Solaris and using Ubuntu since release 8.10.

==== IRC ====
I can be found mostly on these channels: #ubuntu-beginners-team.

==== Ubuntu Beginners Team ====

I have joined Ubuntu and my current mentor is <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/bioterror|Benny Hult]]</nowiki>. Now I am working with <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~duanedesign|duanedesign]]</nowiki>.

My aspirations are to work on networking and kernel domains. Also I would like to work on few areas in cloud computing.

=== Previous Work Experience ===
Working on CDMA technology with Linux and C++. Worked on J2EE for developing websites. Perl and shell scripting for data parsing.

==== Future Plans & Projects ====
I would like to learn Ubuntu kernel and work on the same along with networking.

Now I am working on <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/randy-qt|Randy-QT]]</nowiki> which is used for complex passwords generation.

Looking forward for much better development opportunities.
