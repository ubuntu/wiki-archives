__TOC__

I am an LTSP developer, as well as CTO of Symbio Technologies, a company devoted to creating soltuions around LTSP and diskless thin client technology.

I am primarily interested in pushing LTSP to its limits (assuming that it has any), and bringing the technology to the point that functionally it goes toe-to-toe with PC technology.  There should be no place where you say, "I need such-and-such functionality that only a full PC will provide."
