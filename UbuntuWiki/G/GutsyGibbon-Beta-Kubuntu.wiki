== Introduction ==
On April 12th, 2007, Mark Shuttleworth stated that "''the Fawn has found her legs,''" and <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel-announce/2007-April/000276.html|announced]]</nowiki> the next development cycle codename for the 7.10 release, the Gutsy Gibbon. As with previous releases, the users had made it clear that usability and stability are the things they look for the most. Well, we are happy to say that the goals for the Kubuntu developers for 7.10 will be to increase the usability following the guides created by recent audits from the KDE community, increase stability while using the latest applications for the Linux desktop, and increasing the ease of installation.

Some of the things you can look forward to is better power management, desktop installation improvements, better data migration, and plenty of fixes to the K Desktop Environment. One thing you might be able to look forward to is the possibility of packages created in time for release, the new KDE 4 desktop. However, KDE 4 will not be the default desktop environment for Kubuntu 7.10, but you can guarantee the development team will work hard to bring you installable packages as soon as they possibly can.

Gutsy will '''__not__''' be the next LTS (Long Term Support) release, but it will nonetheless see a lot of server work and be useful for fast-moving server deployments.

'''NOTE:''' ''This is a beta (pre-) release. Pre-release version of Gutsy are '''__NOT__''' encouraged for anyone needing a stable system or for anyone who is not comfortable running into occasional, even frequent, breakage. Pre-release versions of Gutsy '''__ARE__''' recommended for Kubuntu developers and those who want to help in testing, reporting, and fixing bugs.''

== New In Kubuntu 7.10 ==
Gutsy Gibbon Beta CD release brings with it many updated, new, and exciting applications. For this latest release of Kubuntu 7.10, the usability standards have improved and there have already been some aesthetic changes.

With every new pre-release, updates will be documented allowing you to thoroughly test your Kubuntu 7.10 installation. Remember that all of these features are part of a pre-release version of Kubuntu, and may still have issues. We ask that any problems you come across that you file a bug, if one has yet to be filed for your problem.<<BR>>

=== Dolphin ===
'''INFO:''' http://enzosworld.gmxhome.de <<BR>>
''KMenu -> System -> Dolphin''

Kubuntu 7.10 now includes Dolphin as the default file manager. Dolphin has not replaced Konqueror, but was chosen as the default file manager to introduce new users to file management a bit easier than what Konqueror could do. The main focus of Dolphin is usability with the following features:
* a navigation bar for URLs allowing quick navigation through your file system
* split views
* and more...

Dolphin, unlike Konqueror, does not provide browser support as well as some of the advanced KIO slaves and options that Konqueror provided, therefor easing the use of the application.

=== Restricted Drivers Manager ===
''KMenu -> System Settings -> Advanced -> Restricted Manager''

ATI Radeon, NVIDIA GeForce, Broadcom Wireless, and more. If you have it, and there is a restricted driver available, installation and configuration has never been easier.

=== Strigi ===
'''INFO:''' http://www.vandenoever.info/software/strigi/ <<BR>>

Kubuntu 7.10 now includes Strigi, a very fast crawling and advanced desktop search daemon. Strigi, when compared to other indexers is extremely lightweight and has an extensive pluggable backend. Kubuntu has included the Strigi daemon with every install as well as various ways in which to use it. One way is to use the search icon in the task bar to the right or you can simply add the Strigi applet to the Kicker by right clicking on Kicker and selecting ''Add Applet to Panel...''  Launch the full interface with <code>K-menu -> Strigi Desktop Search</code>

=== GDebi KDE ===
'''INFO:''' https://launchpad.net/gdebi <<BR>>

Kubuntu 7.10 has received its very own .deb file installer. Utilizing the Gdebi backend, one of the Kubuntu developers created an amazing and easy to use front end for users wanting to easily install .deb files that they have downloaded.

=== Edubuntu KDE ===
New in 7.10 is the Edubuntu desktop with KDE. Enjoy your favorite educational applications now from within KDE. If you are using one of the 7.10 releases, simply install the <code>edubuntu-desktop-kde</code> from the <code>universe</code> repositories.

=== Kubuntu Restricted Extras ===
MP3, MPEG, AVI, and more can now easily be installed in Kubuntu 7.10. To get all of the multimedia goodness you have been searching for, simply install the <code>kubuntu-restricted-extras</code> package from the <code>multiverse</code> repositories.

=== LiveCD Documentation Update ===
Back again with Kubuntu 7.10, Beta, is the ''About Kubuntu'' document. This document has always been there, just not on the desktop since the days of Dapper. The reason behind this move was it was voiced by community members that it would be great to easily access documentation and information about not only Kubuntu, but also about what they can expect, a bit of information letting the user know they are safe and not damaging their system by running the LiveCD. Hopefully one of these days, this will be replaced by the ''Ubiquity Slideshow''.

=== Konqueror and Flash ===
Konqueror and Flash (Adobe, flashplugin-nonfree) are working once again. Ubuntu developers have patched up <code>gtk</code> which was causing the freeze and CPU temperature increases.

For freedom lovers everywhere we have available Gnash, a 100% Free version of flash.  Install the <code>klash</code> package for a Konqueror plugin.

=== KDE PIM ===
'''INFO:''' http://pim.kde.org <<BR>>

Kubuntu 7.10 has decided to utilize the KDE PIM Enterprise branch from KDE. What exactly is the Enterprise branch? It is a solid and more stable release of the famous KDE PIM suite of tools. Kontact is the main front end to the entire suite and incorporates the entire suite into one single application. KMail, K``Address``Book, KAlarm, KNotes, and more, are all integrated into Kontact.

Another addition to the KDE PIM suite from the developers of Kubuntu is the default installation of the necessary utilities for using GPG and S/MIME encryption/decryption and signing/verification. All GPG components will be correctly configured with the initial installation, however those who are upgrading will have some configuration changes needed. For more information on the GPG implementation, please read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/KMailGPGAgent#head-c6757d6675d3932eaeffb136479725842a81d9b6.

'''INFO:''' http://www.kde-apps.org/content/show.php/Kvkbd?content=56019 <<BR>>
''KMenu -> Utilities -> Kv``Kbd''

Kubuntu 7.10 now includes its very own virtual keyboard called Kv``Kbd. The main purpose of this inclusion was to provide added accessibility to users with limited mobility.
