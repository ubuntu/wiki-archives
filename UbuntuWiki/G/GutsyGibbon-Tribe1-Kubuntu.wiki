== Introduction ==
On April 12th, 2007, Mark Shuttleworth stated that "''the Fawn has found her legs,''" and <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel-announce/2007-April/000276.html|announced]]</nowiki> the next development cycle codename for the 7.10 release, the Gutsy Gibbon. As with previous releases, the users had made it clear that usability and stability are the things they look for the most. Well, we are happy to say that the goals for the Kubuntu developers for 7.10 will be to increase the usability following the guides created by recent audits from the KDE community, increase stability while using the latest applications for the Linux desktop, and increasing the ease of installation.

Some of the things you can look forward to is better power management, desktop installation improvements, better data migration, and plenty of fixes to the K Desktop Environment. One thing you might be able to look forward to is the possibility of packages created in time for release, the new KDE 4 desktop. However, KDE 4 will not be the default desktop environment for Kubuntu 7.10, but you can guarantee the development team will work hard to bring you installable packages as soon as they possibly can.

Gutsy will not be the next LTS (Long Term Support) release, but it will nonetheless see a lot of server work and be useful for fast-moving server deployments.

Tribe 1, the very first in a series of milestone CD images that will be released throughout the Gutsy development cycle, represent the very latest snapshots of Gutsy. The pre-release images are known to be reasonably free of CD-build or installer bugs, however they are not recommended for use in stable environments. These releases will be for those who are developing, documenting, and testing. Tribe 1 releases can be downloaded from the following URL:
* http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/releases/gutsy/

'''NOTE:''' ''This is an alpha (pre-) release. Pre-release version of Gutsy are '''__NOT__''' encouraged for anyone needing a stable system or for anyone who is not comfortable running into occasional, even frequent, breakage. Pre-release versions of Gutsy '''__ARE__''' recommended for Kubuntu developers and those who want to help in testing, reporting, and fixing bugs.''

== New In Tribe 1 ==
Gutsy Gibbon Tribe 1 CD release brings with it many updated, new, and exciting applications. For this latest release of Kubuntu 7.10, the usability standards have improved and there have already been some aesthetic changes.

DigiKam's 0.9.2 series is stressing usability and stability however they haven't forgotten about bugfixes, features, and functionality.

The latest feature, which most artists and photographers will be familiar with, is a <nowiki>[[http://www.digikam.org/?q=node/221|Light Table]]</nowiki>. Yes, you heard that correctly, a light table. A light table assists artists and photographers with reviewing their work ensuring only the highest quality. A light table will show the artist their imperfections in which they can go and touch up. Well in digiKam, the light table function provides the user a similar experience. You can import a photo, drag it onto the light table, and touch up only the areas that need it. Easy to use, brand new, yet so functional. To see a great screenshot of the light table in action, besides the ones attached to this page, please take a look <nowiki>[[http://digikam3rdparty.free.fr/Screenshots/lighttable_v8.png|HERE]]</nowiki>.
