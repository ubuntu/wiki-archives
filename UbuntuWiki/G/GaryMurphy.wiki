Email: 
Relatively new to Ubuntu, but running under the extreme conditions in a Dell Inspiron 1521 and in a real-world job environment as the systems administrator for a major sports-news provider.  Linux-wise, however, I go back to the days of Yggrassil and InfoMagic, back to when Yuri first founded the Toronto LUG.
