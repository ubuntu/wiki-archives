== Introduction ==

The Xubuntu developers are moving very quickly to bring you the absolute latest and greatest software the Ubuntu and Xfce community have to offer.  Gutsy Gibbon Tribe 5 is the fourth of several alpha releases for Xubuntu 7.10.  With this Tribe comes a whole host of excellent new features.  The feature list for 7.10 has been steadily growing since Gutsy opened several months ago.  Many exciting new packages have been uploaded to Xubuntu, and developers continue to work to add even more features that will appear later in the release cycle.  

'''Note: This is still an alpha (not a stable) release! Alpha releases of Gutsy are not encouraged for anyone who needs a stable system or who is not comfortable running into a broken system.  Alpha releases of Gutsy ARE recommended for Xubuntu developers and anyone interested in helping to test, report, and fix bugs.'''

== Upgrading from Feisty ==

If you upgrade from feisty, please make sure that you have update-manager 0.59.23 from feisty-proposed installed. Then run "update-manager -d". 

== Printing ==
A lot of effort has gone into the printing system.

Xubuntu now creates a virtual "PDF printer" by default, which you can use to generate PDF files from all applications that do not have native PDF output support, like GIMP, Firefox, and other non-Gnome applications.

The old, unmaintained gnome-cups-manager has been replaced with system-config-printer, a printer management application from Fedora. We now have a well maintained piece of software, and good collaboration with Tim Waugh, assisted by Till Kamppeter who has been doing an amazing job, and has made big improvements on it.

== New Features for Firefox ==
Ubufox ships two new, hot Ubuntu Firefox features - Apt-Enabled Plugin Finder Wizard and Extension Manager integration.  The new Extension Manager is available in Firefox by selecting Tools > Add-ons > Get Ubuntu Add-ons.

== Artwork Updates ==

Additional portions of updated Xubuntu artwork have made their way into the Tribe 5 release.  The new default theme is Murrina Storm Cloud, a very recent addition to the Murrina line, and Xubuntu presents the theme using the latest window manager theme from Xfce's SVN tree.  

Complimentary theme elements, including new default wallpaper, usplash, and GDM themes are also included, and give the Xubuntu desktop a highly polished, and refined look. 
 
== Desktop ==

Here is a small preview of what a default Tribe 5 installed desktop looks like.  You may notice there is a "Places" application added to the panel, which should help you easily navigate to common places using Thunar.

== Server ==

The Ubuntu Server Team has grown and expanded and major work is being done to make the server as easy install and use as the desktop.  In Tribe 5, we will see Ebox, a configuration tool, as well as a lot of bug fixing and new versions of many popular server packages.  Ebox is a network services control tool.  Designed to be easy to use even for non-Unix admins, Ebox allows control of a huge number of services from a single web interface.
