Hi! I'm a visual artist:
* I make art in Los Angeles: http://www.artboy.info/
* I teach art at Long Beach State: http://art110.wikispaces.com/
* I talk about art on KBCH Radio: http://www.artboy.info/strange/

I'm really excited about Free / Open software. I guess I've drunk the RMS cool-aid :+] I'm definitely more of a cheerleader than someone who actually knows anything. I teach about 600 - 700 students / year at Long Beach and I'd like to be teaching the class on Linux, but I currently have 3 roadblocks:

* Trouble getting my HP DV 9500 / Nvidia to give full 1024 x 768 vga output to our campus data projectors
* A LOT OF TROUBLE getting ANY audio out of the DV 9500
* My current clicker software doesn't run under Linux

If / when I can solve these 3 problems I'll be teaching 6 or 7 hundred students a year in a Linux environment.
