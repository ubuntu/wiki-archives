== Introduction ==
=== Welcome to the Ubuntu Gujarat Team ===

This section is heavily under construction (and so is the Gujarat LoCo Team), so please stay tuned for more to come.

== Contact ==
The creation of a mailing list for Gujarat LoCo Team has been requested (Ubuntu-in-gj) and once it gets operational, the URL will be posted here. 

== How to Contribute ==
While the formal Ubuntu communication channels are being established, interested 'Ubuntuers' from Gujarat can check http://www.ossraj.org and share ideas, suggestions etc. on getting the Gujarat LoCo Team off the ground (and beyond :-)).
