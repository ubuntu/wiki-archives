Do you want to make your participation in the GlobalBugJam more entertaining? Why not play Bug Jam bingo!

Brian has written a <nowiki>[[http://people.ubuntu.com/~brian/tmp/lp_bingo.user.js|greasemonkey script]]</nowiki> that’ll search bug descriptions for buzz words and alert you with a bingo spot to mark off.  The dynamite Leann has helped out by creating <nowiki>[[http://people.ubuntu.com/~ogasawara/bingo/bingo.html|a bingo card]]</nowiki> for us to use.  When you find a bug that calls out a bingo spot, click on that cell in your card. After you’ve completed a column, row or diagonal shout "Bingo!" in your team's location and / or in the #ubuntu-bugs channel for a hug.

Each person playing should use the same greasemonkey script, so the buzz words are the same, but everyone should have a different bingo card. You can get a unique card by clicking the "New card" button. The buzz word list was created based off word counts in the ubuntu-bugs mailing list and some I've seen before in bug reports.

We hope this makes your bug jam more fun and look forward to hearing shouts of "Bingo!".
