Once a record specification is finalized, you mustn't alter it, but you may add a new version proposal below it, bumping v''N''.

The database name is the same as the gconf prefix, changed slightly.   Gconf is "/apps/gwibber", and desktopcouch is "apps-gwibber".

The record_type is "https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Gwibber/DesktopCouch"

== v1 ==

The record data should look like
   { 
     "record_type": "https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Gwibber/DesktopCouch",
     "record_type_version": "'''v1'''",
     "protocol": str(protocol_name),
     "username": str(account_name_at_service),
     "password": str(optional_password_at_service),
     "application_annotations": {
         "gwibber": {
             "receive_enabled": bool(optional),
             "search_enabled": bool(optional),
             "message_color": str(optional_hash_12_nybble_hex_color),
         },
     },
     "contacts": [str(users), str(that), str(we), str(follow), str(at_this_service)]
   }
