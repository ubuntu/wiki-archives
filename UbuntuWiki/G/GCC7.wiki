=== arm gcc 7 abi transition ===

As of June 2017 with GCC 6, some packages fail autopkgtests on armhf only, due to notes output to stderr similar to the following:
<code>note: parameter passing for argument of type ‘__gnu_cxx::__normal_iterator<const double*, std::vector<double> >’ will change in GCC 7.1</code>

See:
https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=77728

Since the release of GCC 7.1, the wording of the notes changed slightly:
<code>note: parameter passing for argument of type ‘__gnu_cxx::__normal_iterator<const double*, std::vector<double> >’ changed in GCC 7.1</code>

Affected packages:

* glbinding
* globjects
* ciftilib
* fast5
* shark
* viennacl
* mathic
* mathicgb
* memtailor
* givaro
* primesieve

Workaround: add the following to '''debian/tests/control''':<<BR>>
<code>Restrictions: allow-stderr</code>
