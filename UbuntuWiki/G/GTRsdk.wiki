== Introduction ==

I have been an Ubuntu user since 2009. The first time I used Ubuntu was in 2008, when trying to fix a computer for someone. I learned that I could have a secure PC, if I put Ubuntu on it. Unfortunately, I didn't have a computer of my own, and I only had access to PowerPC Macs, so I would not use Ubuntu again until 2009, when I got my first computer. In August 2009, I installed Ubuntu to the computer's hard drive. I was running 9.04, which I thought was OK, but I had issues with the hardware. My wireless card didn't work. I was using a wired connection to get ndiswrapper installed so I could install the Windows driver. Everything was working as I thought it should, but when I had to begin a school year, at an online school. After getting help on Facebook, the problems I had were gone.

I have been using the development release of Ubuntu since 2009, as early as the Alpha days of Karmic (9.10), which I think started with Alpha 2 or 3. I have been running a development version of each release starting with 9.10, to (at the time of writing this) 11.10.

Currently, I know how to package some programs into PPAs, but I need more experience. If you need an application put into a PPA, let me know. I would love to help!
