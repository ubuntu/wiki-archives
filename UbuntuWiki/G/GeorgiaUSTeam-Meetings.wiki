== Meetings ==

=== Next Meeting Important Info ===
The next IRC meeting will be rather large since we will be discussing several large changes, so we recommend that you visit <nowiki>[[GeorgiaUSTeam-Meetings-Topics]]</nowiki> for more information.

==== Types of Meetings ====

<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/irc-small.png]]</nowiki>  '''IRC Online Meetings''' - Meetings held on the IRC chat network.  Basically a chat room where meetings are held.  Fairly informal, they are also open to the public.  These meetings are held weekly.  See <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/GeorgiaUSTeam/Help/GetHelp|this]]</nowiki> page (IRC Support Instructions) for more information on how to connect.

<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/IconUsers.png]]</nowiki>  '''Face to Face Meetings''' - Meetings held typically at a restaurant.  It is a chance for Ubuntu users to get together and meet each other. These meetings are held monthly.

=== Archives ===
To see what has happened at past IRC meetings and on the channels, see http://logs.ubuntu-eu.org.  Select "Freenode" and navigate to the date (one day off, since the host site is in Europe) and then select #ubuntu-us-ga.
