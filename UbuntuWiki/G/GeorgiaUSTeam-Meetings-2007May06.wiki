=== Log ===
<pre>
bandb|laptop> ok, logos, I think ClinicalMistake found out that the logos we wanted to poll were all ok, right ClinicalMistake ?
<bandb|laptop> think he got a response from trademark@ saying it was ok. So someone needs to post the poll on the forum.
<bandb|laptop> anyone interested?
<jsvh> I can do it
<bandb|laptop> jsvh: cool
<jsvh> which ones are we putting in the poll?
<bandb|laptop> ummm...
<bandb|laptop> i think we had picked out some a couple meetings ago
<JonReagan> i think we chose the logos in one of our past meetings
<Bakey> I think 2 or 3 by Clinical and 1 by nomasteryoda, right?
<bandb|laptop> i think its in the meeting logs
<bandb|laptop> sounds about right Bakey
<JonReagan> right... I'll give it a check
<bandb|laptop> ok, ubuntu boxes, I posted a picture of what some people are getting from canonical, the CDs come in a nice little box, take a look at the meetings page on the wiki
<bandb|laptop> I'm wondering if that should be integrated into the box designs
<bandb|laptop> we don't have to, it was just a random thought
<JonReagan> i have made a nice little box to go on top of tables
<JonReagan> I have also uploaded a pick to the wiki
<JonReagan> *picture
<jsvh> I like it
<Bakey> as for me, i've gotten ahold of some plexi and plan to start building sometime
<bandb|laptop> JonReagan: looks good
<bandb|laptop> Bakey: outstanding
<Bakey> I just need to find a heat gun so I can bend it
<JonReagan> cool... not really sure where to get one, but cool
<bandb|laptop> ask heathen , he probably has every imaginable tool
<Bakey> I think my uncle may have one...otherwise i may try with a small torch
<bandb|laptop> JonReagan: what is your box made off? will be able to hold a few CDs without toppling over?
<jsvh> hey robertj
<JonReagan> i have tested the box, and it holds up... it is made out of regular computer paper
<bandb|laptop> hi robertj
<bandb|laptop> JonReagan: excellent
<JonReagan> hey robertj
<MKR> Classy
<robertj> howdy, how was yesterdays meetup? The drive back from SC took longer than expected & we couldnt make it back
<Bakey> Jon, got a link to the pic?
<bandb|laptop> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/GeorgiaUSTeam/Marketing?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=100_0465.JPG
<JonReagan> ummmm.... the pic is in the attatchments in the /marketing page
<JonReagan> lol... that was fast
<bandb|laptop> i had the page up
<JonReagan> oh
<bandb|laptop> ok, so JonReagan can you make a few more
<Bakey> oh nice
<MKR> And make up a template :P
<JonReagan> sure, I can make quite a few
<Bakey> I bet that'll work just fine for indoors...maybe printed on card stock
<JonReagan> the template is just one you print off your computer
<MKR> hmm
<JonReagan> I will upload it to the wiki
<MKR> I should get a box of shipit CDs and stow it in the student center waiting area at school
<MKR> -waiting area
<Bakey> Cool, and some folding/gluing instructions?
<JonReagan> that's a good idea!
<JonReagan> it comes w/ the instructions
<Bakey> :) nice
<JonReagan> I will include some notes, they sometimes can be confusing
<MKR> How close can CDs be to a microwave without them being damaged?
<robertj> MKR: anywhere but inside?
<MKR> :D
<Bakey> I think they're OK as long as they're not inside
<Bakey> although inside it quite entertaining
<JonReagan> lol
<Bakey> *is
<MKR> Oh yeah
<MKR> Oh, marketing tool!
<Bakey> ?
<MKR> Nah, never mind
<bandb|laptop> so it looks like we are in goodd here, JonReagan make a few more, Bakey will get us a prototype soon.
<bandb|laptop> good shape
<Bakey> yeah I hope so
<bandb|laptop> and we should get CDs *soon*
<bandb|laptop> so we'll mail them out to Bakey and JonReagan
<MKR> I was going to suggest makign a video of someone microwaving a shipit CD, then "booting" the computer with it (though it'll already be installed, so it won't boot from the CD)
<MKR> But that would be dishonest :)
<bandb|laptop> lol
<JonReagan> cool... these boxes only require 1 piece of paper
<JonReagan> dishonest - but really fun!
<bandb|laptop> Bakey, JonReagan, do either of you need stickers? Think jsvh had some he could send to you
<Bakey> I'd like some after I get my prototype built
<jsvh> yea, I got a bunch from System 76
<JonReagan> not at the moment... I don't have any places to put the CDs or the boxes
<bandb|laptop> ok, jsvh can you send them to Bakey ?
<jsvh> the "powered by Ubuntu" stickers
<JonReagan> maybe as soon as I get one in place, I could use them to put in the cd cases
<jsvh> yea, email me and let me know how many and where u want them sent to Bakey
<MKR> I'm surprised they don't ship them with the CDs
<Bakey> ok, will do jsvh
<JonReagan> yeah. that would really be cool if they did
<bandb|laptop> MKR, think they shipped like 5 stickers
<bandb|laptop> with the CDs
<MKR> oh
<bandb|laptop> yeah, kinda dumb, oh well...
<bandb|laptop> ok, are we done with the boxes for now?
<MKR> Oh, one thing
<CompiledKernel> ok hangovers and lawn work do NOT mix
<JonReagan> lol!
<MKR> Does the GPL let a stoe owner chargea "stocking fee" for placing the CDs?
<MKR> It would be good for compelling them to stock them
<MKR> Like $1-3
<JonReagan> I think so... I will have to find out
<bandb|laptop> MKR, you probably could, don't stop anyone from charging anything
<bandb|laptop> thats why people sell it on e
<bandb|laptop> sell linux CDs on ebay
<CompiledKernel> being the Gideon of Ubuntu CDs
<CompiledKernel> Id say theres no reason you cant charge
<MKR> That would be a good way to get owners of high-traffic shops to let you put them on their counter
<CompiledKernel> if you wanted to
<JonReagan> yeah, maybe like on a small table next to their door, or maybe on their register counter?
<bandb|laptop> MKR lets talk about once we have the boxes and we need to come up with a way of distributing them
<Bakey> It'd be awesome to get them at the register where people check out
<MKR> ok
<CompiledKernel> I left a bunch in a barnes and noble once
<JonReagan> yeah!
<CompiledKernel> a girl came up to the counter and asked the girl
<CompiledKernel> how much it cost
<CompiledKernel> I nearly died in laughter
<bandb|laptop> yeah, lets put it on the agenda for next week
<bandb|laptop> nice
<JonReagan> lol... that's awsome
<CompiledKernel> yeah
<robertj_> Bakey: don't the cds say something about ubuntu beeing free and to report people selling ship-it cds?
<CompiledKernel> mouments in Kingbahamut Greatness
<Bakey> robertj_ I don't know, I ton't think so
<Bakey> *don't
<JonReagan> i don't know... they probalby wouldn't mind having free cd's in their store, its like their AOL cds
<Bakey> ooo, replace all AOL cds with Ubuntu ones
<MKR> It might be a last-resort step if they say no to distributing them for free
<MKR> (if it's ok with shipit)
<bandb|laptop> let me look at one of the shipit cds
<CompiledKernel> lol
<CompiledKernel> bakey
<CompiledKernel> AOL cds
<CompiledKernel> glorified coffee coaster
<JonReagan> lol... nice
<Bakey> CompiledKernel - did you see where some guys made a chair out of AOL cds?
<MKR> I wouldn't waste the condensation on them :P
<CompiledKernel> you know BandB
<CompiledKernel> one of the other staff
<bandb|laptop> nothing on the shipit packaging says it can't be sold
<CompiledKernel> went down this road
<CompiledKernel> of distributing stuff
<CompiledKernel> I cant remember what mark said about it in the CC meeting that ensued after
<Bakey> http://stupidco.com/aol_throne_finished.html
<JonReagan> cool... good news about the shipit CDs as well!
<bandb|laptop> we might not to be able to do the charging stuff, but we can hand them out to businesses
<JonReagan> sure... why not?
<CompiledKernel> ive found businesses to be unreceptive in the past
<CompiledKernel> have to be careful there
<robertj_> I think mom & pop computer shops are likely to be the most receptive
<JonReagan> I think I may have some places in mind that we could place these
<bandb|laptop> yeah, this isn't going to work at best buy
<Bakey> Yep robertj_ local shops usually are
<robertj_> They would probably be happy to give away the cds with "naked" machines
<CompiledKernel> I have a list of probably 20 or so
<CompiledKernel> friendly local shops
<CompiledKernel> that would distribute or already do
<bandb|laptop> alright, we'll get together a list of potential stores
<CompiledKernel> robertj_ that might be a push, naked boxes with a free ubuntu cd
<Bakey> not to be rude, but in the interest of moving on, didn't we say we'll discuss this next week after we get boxes from Jon and maybe a prototype from me?
<bandb|laptop> Bakey: good idea
<JonReagan> sure
<Bakey> :D
<bandb|laptop> it will be on the agenda for nexdt week
<JonReagan> cool
<bandb|laptop> JonReagan: did you have some ideas about the dell thing
<JonReagan> yes
<JonReagan> The basic idea is that we could include some dell in our marketing
<Bakey> Need to be careful here, last thing we want is a letter from Dell's lawyers
<bandb|laptop> yeah, could be tricky
<JonReagan> right... i'd have to email them first
<Bakey> Good idea
<JonReagan> give them the final product, ect.
<robertj_> AFAIK Dell situation is still lacking in details?
<JonReagan> yes, this would begin after the details are final
<robertj_> I'd hold off
<Bakey> Last I heard they will definitely be offering Ubuntu as an option on a couple of desktops and 1 laptop
<JonReagan> yup... that have an announcement on their site
<CompiledKernel> from what I hear , midrange desktop
<CompiledKernel> and 2 midrange laptops
<JonReagan> it would help ubuntu look more professional
<Bakey> http://www.dell.com/content/topics/segtopic.aspx/ubuntu?c=us&cs=19&l=en&
<JonReagan> there it is! :)
<bandb|laptop> yeah, I think putting dell anywhere is going to be tricky
<Bakey> http://www.dellcommunity.com/supportforums/board/message?board.id=sw_linux&thread.id=8812
<Bakey> Ubuntu's all over Dell's websites/forums
<JonReagan> anyways, I think it would be a nice plus for our ubuntu marketing... that's basically all I have. (nice link!)
<Bakey> I think it's safe to mention them in the same breath anyway
<JonReagan> yup
* ** robertj_ is now known as robertj
<bandb|laptop> any ideas on how to go about mentioning them?
<JonReagan> maybe the names, models of computers offered?
<MKR> Just be vague :P
<Bakey> Hmmm, maybe something like "Coming soon on Dell computers"
<MKR> "supported by system builders!"
<bandb|laptop> might be a little while before we find out all that stuff
<Bakey> That'd be the best thing Jon, but I don't think Dell has released that info yet
<MKR> Or "supported by major computer manufacturers!". :D
<JonReagan> not yet, but when they do...
<Bakey> Yeah, when they do, it'd definitely be a good think to include with marketing materials
<Bakey> and I don't see why Dell would have a problem with that, it's free advertising for them
<JonReagan> yeah... especially since a lot of people do not upgrade, and just buy a new computer
<MKR> Bakey, companies sometimes get upset when people try to market for them
<MKR> Without asking, that is
<JonReagan> I'll email them as soon as they release more info
<bandb|laptop> ok...next...
<bandb|laptop> approval stuff...nothing really...lets do the boxes and then we'll apply
<bandb|laptop> feisty CDs...we are just waiting at this point
<bandb|laptop> and oncce we get approved we can get a lot more CDs
<Bakey> has anyone seen a good option for making burned CD's look a little more professional?
<MKR> A good designer and a CD printer :P
<jsvh> lightscribe?
<Bakey> I've got neither
<bandb|laptop> some LoCos are making those CD label things
<bandb|laptop> that cover the whole CD
<bandb|laptop> lightscribe seems to take too long
<bandb|laptop> like 15 or 20 minutes per CD
<JonReagan> wow... btw, I have tried using inkscape... what a cool app!!!
<JonReagan> 15-20 *per cd*!?
<bandb|laptop> yeah
<MKR> hmm
<MKR> 15 people doing 4 per hour...
* MKR ponders
<JonReagan> hmm
<bandb|laptop> yeah, thats we need to figure out those CD label things
<bandb|laptop> but I don't know if any of the software works in linux
<MKR> I think that k3b prints CD labels
<bandb|laptop> does anyone have a printer they could try this out on? I don't have a printer at all.
<MKR> http://www.ask.com/web?q=CD+label+paper&qsrc=0&o=333&l=dir
<jsvh> How long should we have the poll up for the logo? a week, two?
<bandb|laptop> lets do a couple weeks and we'll send out an email to the list
<MKR> I have access to a color laser, but it's not mine, so it would be hard ot get approval to do something like this
<bandb|laptop> yeah, hard to get access to the color printer at work for me too
<MKR> http://www.cdstomper.com/
<bandb|laptop> i wonder how much it would cost just going to staples
<JonReagan> k... also, i haven't been able to find any lightscribe burning feature :(
<Bakey> I may can do something with our color printer at work, provided I buy the paper
<ClinicalMistake> hey sorry I've been out
<JonReagan> the UPS store has copies for 39c a page... expensive, expensive, expensive.... kinko's was 89c per page
<ClinicalMistake> was taking a phone call for a while >.>
<bandb|laptop> Bakey: i'll pay for the paper if you can try it out
<MKR> It's ok, we're only deciding the fate of the free world :D
<JonReagan> hey clinical
<Bakey> bandb - let me talk to my boss to make sure it'd be OK
<bandb|laptop> Bakey: ok, let me know
<Bakey> how many copies are we talkin about, 50? 100?
<ClinicalMistake> how goes
<bandb|laptop> Bakey: maybe to make 100 CDs first?
<Bakey> ok
<Bakey> maybe using this label: http://www.zimagez.com/zimage/ubuntu7-04livei3860.php
<MKR> Smexy
<MKR> Actually, I like that better than canonical's
<bandb|laptop> yeah, and I think Corvix had made something similar with different colors
<bandb|laptop> Bakey: find out if you can pull it off and then we'll decide on the design
<JonReagan> cool
<Bakey> alright
<Bakey> I'll talk to my boss Monday about it
<MKR> GIMP has a CD cover template :D
<ClinicalMistake> hey though, for now, is there anything yall need done?
<ClinicalMistake> I think I can have at least 1 thing done for next weeks meeting
<MKR> We need sharks with lasers on their heads
<ClinicalMistake> ...
<bandb|laptop> ok, if anyone has any opinions of stickers or posters they would be interested in using to market, check out https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MarketingTeam/DIYWebsite/Get/
<ClinicalMistake> already done MKR :D
<bandb|laptop> ClinicalMistake: you have to color laser printer?
<bandb|laptop> access
<ClinicalMistake> no not right now >.>
<ClinicalMistake> come like next month I will :D
<bandb|laptop> ClinicalMistake: thats right, mr. editor
<bandb|laptop> we may have to abuse your rights to the newspaper
<ClinicalMistake> haha :P
<ClinicalMistake> yeah we're getting a fucking boss new printer
<ClinicalMistake> This thing is going to be amazing
<bandb|laptop> ClinicalMistake: that could be a huge help for us
<JonReagan> :)
<MKR> None of those seem to fit with a kiosk thing :\
<MKR> (the ones in the poll)
<MKR> Wait, never mind
<bandb|laptop> lol, we need to build one of the kiosk things one day
<ClinicalMistake> hmm hold on
<ClinicalMistake> not sure if it's color
<ClinicalMistake> 1 sec
<bandb|laptop> ok, if anyone wants stickers or posters, see the link above and let me know
<jsvh> LoCo LoGo poll: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=435077
<JonReagan> cool
<bandb|laptop> i only see a logo for choice 1
<ClinicalMistake> http://www.xante.com/products/4n/accel-a-writer4N_printer.aspx <-- I dont think this is color :(
<bandb|laptop> well ClinicalMistake , you know what you have to put in the newspaper budget then, don't you? :-P
<JonReagan> newspaper?
<ClinicalMistake> haha dear god, I dunno about that
<MKR> We have a HP Color Laserjet 2605dn. Nice and cheap, and prints well
<MKR> $300 something
<bandb|laptop> robertj: here are a few pics from yesterday: http://www.flickr.com/photos/ubuntugeorgia
<Bakey> bandb - you have to sign in to see the others
<bandb|laptop> Bakey: got it
<JonReagan> nice pics
<robertj> bandb|laptop: nice, you should do hotspots with nicks
<bandb|laptop> robertj: good idea
<ClinicalMistake> Who's who?!
<ClinicalMistake> :P
<JonReagan> lol
<ClinicalMistake> You know, it wouldnt make sense for that thing to NOT be in color, especially considering how much it costs
<bandb|laptop> http://www.flickr.com/photos/ubuntugeorgia/485772926/ is fignew
<bandb|laptop> http://www.flickr.com/photos/ubuntugeorgia/485772912/ the left is CompiledKernel

<bandb|laptop> http://www.flickr.com/photos/ubuntugeorgia/485772908/ left is b-rad, right is Corvix
<JonReagan> wow... that was a pretty nice turnout!
<bandb|laptop> http://www.flickr.com/photos/ubuntugeorgia/486779066/ I'm in yellow in the back with my eyes closed
<CompiledKernel> bandb
<CompiledKernel> shouldnt shut your eyes
<bandb|laptop> don't you know photographs steal your soul?
<JonReagan> ahh, well, this saves me from having to locate you guys in the next meeting!
<CompiledKernel> JonReagan
<CompiledKernel> it was funny
<JonReagan> huh?
<CompiledKernel> B-rad and I stood outside the vortext
<CompiledKernel> staring at each other
<JonReagan> lol
<CompiledKernel> and then he tosses out a -- after 10 minutes
<CompiledKernel> "Are you here for a linux user group"
<JonReagan> lol!
<Bakey> hey guys, I gotta go
<bandb|laptop> i think thats all we have for the agenda
</pre>
