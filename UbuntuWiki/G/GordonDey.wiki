=== About Me ===
I've been noodling around unix-like systems for about two decades.
In the last one, I've used GNU/Linux from a stack of 30 floppies, Slackware (0.99, and it ran on a 30MB mfm winchester) through !RedHat, Suse, and now Debian and Ubuntu.
Simultaneously, I've programmed with flavours of Pascal, Fortran, assembler (and worse) but most recently C and C++.

=== Interests ===
I'm interested in radios, hardware, servers (therefore drivers/kernel-ish) things, networking, time and security.
GUIs are "kewl" but the CLI is where I find the power and flexibility lay.

=== Co-ordinates ===
Typically, I'm available evenings, say midnight UTC or 19:30ish EST.
On launchpad as ~gordon-dey and on irc as cagordon.
