== About Me ==

Gremelin is the alias of the <nowiki>[[http://www.undergroundnews.com/|UGN Security]]</nowiki> owner (as well as numerous others throughout the years) James Corthell.  He is located in the greater Portland, Oregon metro area.  Father of one, lover of code, women, pizza, and video games.

I am a full time web developer by trade; I've done much work with several web hosts and script providers (namely the Ultimate Bulletin Board forum solution; of which several others are based off of).

You can find out a lot more information on Gremelin at <nowiki>[[http://www.gremelin.com/|Gremelin.com]]</nowiki>.

My favorite work includes helping windows novices transition to Linux (Ubuntu/Gnome); after profiling their needs, most actually prefer the transition (since all most need is a push, and to be told that there is a free variant of MS Office which has more features).
