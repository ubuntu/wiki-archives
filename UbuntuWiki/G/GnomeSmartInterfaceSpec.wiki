=== Summary ===
The Gnome Smart Interfaces are a collection on gnome graphical User Interfaces.  They allow users different Interfaces for different types of Package Management Tasks.  The Interfaces are written in Python, invoking backend routines in Smart Package Manager, also written in python.

=== Rationale ===
Currently, Ubuntu has no uniform interfaces for package management.  This results in confusion for users and redundancy for developers and maintainers.

=== Use cases ===
* Anne would like to install a package that she has all ready download. She wants to be able to click on a package file and have the package 'just installed.'  A simple dialog will appear informing Anne of the current status of the file and any dependences that will also need to be installed.

* Amy would like to upgrade her desktop.  She wants to be able to select Update Software from the menu bar.  A simple dialog box and progress box will keep Amy apprised of the updaters' progress.

* Alice would like to have her desktop updated daily.  She wants her desktop kept up to date with little or no interaction.

* Annette would like to graphically manage her packages.  She wants a sophisticated interface that allows her to manage her packages in great detail.

=== Scope ===
Since servers will be needing to handle package management via a text interface and Kubuntu will have Qt-based interfaces the Gtk interface code should be cleanly separated from the Smart Package Manager backend.  The design specifications will work for both Qt and Gtk interfaces.
