''' PAGE BEING UPDATED '''

Thank you for your interest in volunteering as a mentor. 

Without your commitment, it would be impossible for us to participate. You will be mentoring a student! This is a great opportunity for you to learn management skills and to gain experience in guiding people. 

Mentors will choose a student and provide guidance to help the student bring their project to completion. It is very important to consider common interests in projects and working in a similar timezone. 

Prospective mentors should be active in the Ubuntu community who have been able to make a useful and sustained contribution to Ubuntu, and have demonstrated an ability to lead the community in further development of the distribution.

You'll be responsible for answering any questions the selected students have, and help them to settle into the community for the duration of the project.  You will also be responsible for providing feedback to Google, the Student and Ubuntu on the project progress, as well as evaluating the project at the end of the programme.

If you think you would be interested, please let us know! Add your name and project <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/GoogleCodeIn2010/Mentorslist|here]]</nowiki> or write to us:

Consider this opportunity if you have experience as a manager, project manager, a team coordinator, teacher or something similar. If this is the first time you are going to guide a student, please ask for help and read the manuals below.

* Make sure you have the time to mentor a student (It is suggested that you dedicate 2 - 3 hours a week)
* Designate a back up in case you can no longer participate
* Keep in touch with your student
* If you can't reply, please advise the administrator or your back-up
* Note that you might be requested to travel to Google Headquarters (California) for the Mentors Summit
* Manuals to read:
