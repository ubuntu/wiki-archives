==== Getting there by public transport ====

The easiest way is to take a train to Chester Road Station, and get picked up from there: give us a ring on 0121 313 3850 say 15 minutes before arriving at Chester Road and someone can pick you up. But ''please'' try and organise things so that a group arrives at the same time as we don't want to spend all morning going back and forth.

==== Facilities ====

* Free Wifi (Of Course!)
* Projector
* Two rooms
* Space for up to 15 (maybe a few more at a push)
* There will be water to drink (fresh from the tap)

==== Details ====
 
Hi all, John Pinner from the Linux Emporium has kindly donated his conference room for the use during the Jam. 

Times are flexible at the moment, and will depend on when people want to turn up/go home. I'm not adverse to starting later, but I think we'll have to stick to Office Hours. It'd also be nice to try and link up with the other UK bugjams. Please indicate below the times you'd prefer to attend

I am looking for someone that knows bug triaging fairly well and can handle questions and some of the unexpected likely to come up. Ideally they would have participated in past Bug Days and regularly visit #ubuntu-bugs or the mailing lists.
Hopefully this person would be able to lead some sessions.
If you can, please mark yourself as a possible leader.

Could you please update the list if you are wanting to attend.
