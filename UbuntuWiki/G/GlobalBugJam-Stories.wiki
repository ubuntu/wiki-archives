===== Pennsylvania =====

We had a total of 9 people show up for our 6 hour Jam, a couple of whom were new and one who came out from New Jersey to join in. Cake, pizza and soda were the draw, but it was the nourishment of some delicious fruit that a co-worker of Art's (who showed up for the day to help out, being interested in our work) brought kept some of us from keeling over from too much junk food, she was a life-saver!
