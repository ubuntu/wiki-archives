__TOC__

=== Georgia LoCo Projects ===
Below is a list of both active and completed projects/goals. If you would like to propose a project or goal simply add it to the "New Projects list" below. Unassigned projects can be claimed by any member. Projects can also be assigned to more than one member. However, before adding your name to an already assigned project you should speak with one of the existing assignees or with one of the leaders. This way work will not be duplicated and conflicts in implementation will be prevented.
