Apr 01 14:22:47 <boredandblogging>	jon, you want to tell us your idea? we can talk about it now and then we can talk about it during the meeting as well
Apr 01 14:23:06 <JReagan1990>	ok
Apr 01 14:23:22 <JReagan1990>	which idea... the one in the agenda?
Apr 01 14:24:08 <boredandblogging>	yeah
Apr 01 14:24:11 <JReagan1990>	This will take a second to type out, so hold on. :)
Apr 01 14:24:19 <boredandblogging>	take your time
Apr 01 14:28:23 <robertj>	is agenda on wiki?
Apr 01 14:29:38 <jsvh>	I dont really have much
Apr 01 14:30:04 <jsvh>	I may teach a intro class on Ubuntu, I may upload the info onto the wiki
Apr 01 14:30:24 <JReagan1990>	I first thought of my idea while searching for a new home, passing by a fedex-kinkos and looking at the shipit page.  My idea is to have a box, like those that are used to put home sale ads in.  Then, we would put a sheet of paper, full of ubuntu info, with a cd from shipit taped on into the box (25 copies or so).  Then, we stick the box outside of our houses, streetcorners, wherever it may be handy, so that when people drive b
Apr 01 14:30:25 <jsvh>	anyone could add content that it needed
Apr 01 14:31:22 <jsvh>	Cool idea
Apr 01 14:31:48 <JReagan1990>	thanks... it's just in the planning stage now ;)
Apr 01 14:32:46 <jsvh>	Some ubuntu stickers should b on the way from System 76
Apr 01 14:32:53 <jsvh>	we could include those
Apr 01 14:32:58 <JReagan1990>	sweet.
Apr 01 14:33:32 <JReagan1990>	I was thinking that we might need to get clearance from Canonical for this idea, so we could use the logo
Apr 01 14:34:18 <JReagan1990>	I think it's under the Creative Commons license
Apr 01 14:34:40 <jsvh>	sounds good, we could even make a guide for for other people to follow
Apr 01 14:35:13 <jsvh>	we could have ubuntu boxes pop up all over
Apr 01 14:35:22 <JReagan1990>	that would be awesome!
Apr 01 14:35:26 *	robertj is luke-warm on the handing out cds blindly thing
Apr 01 14:35:26 <boredandblogging>	oh wwo
Apr 01 14:35:38 <boredandblogging>	this is a really cool idea
Apr 01 14:36:29 <jsvh>	robertj, what problems do you see coming up?
Apr 01 14:36:38 <JReagan1990>	problems?
Apr 01 14:36:58 <JReagan1990>	oh... nevermind.
Apr 01 14:37:00 <robertj>	jsvh: people with malformed expectations, hardware, etc
Apr 01 14:37:30 <JReagan1990>	ahhh.  well, I thought we could give a link to our loco team site
Apr 01 14:37:41 <jsvh>	ah, so an unexperenced user taking them and running into trouble?
Apr 01 14:37:58 <robertj>	any first time linux user
Apr 01 14:38:01 <JReagan1990>	maybe a warning that would tell people to check their hardware before installing
Apr 01 14:38:10 <JReagan1990>	since it's a liveCD
Apr 01 14:38:56 <robertj>	do the cds still contain win32 FOSS?
Apr 01 14:39:06 <JReagan1990>	I think so
Apr 01 14:39:10 <jsvh>	yea, we could have an informative flyer we could upload to be passed out with it
Apr 01 14:39:19 <jsvh>	I think so
Apr 01 14:39:59 <JReagan1990>	We would need to make the warning message REALLY big so that people will not get ticked off if their computer dies
Apr 01 14:40:06 <robertj>	I think a step 1. use FOSS in Windows, step 2. try the cd step 3. install on your computer could be a good approach
Apr 01 14:40:28 <JReagan1990>	that sounds good
Apr 01 14:41:02 <boredandblogging>	thats a lot of steps for most people
Apr 01 14:41:27 <boredandblogging>	most people just expect stuff to work
Apr 01 14:41:27 <JReagan1990>	especially if they are computer illiterate
Apr 01 14:41:29 <jsvh>	yea, we dont want people having bad excperences with ubuntu. just ease them into open source
Apr 01 14:41:35 <boredandblogging>	yeah
Apr 01 14:41:39 <robertj>	boredandblogging: the only way to get it to juts work is to have them buy a new computer with Ubuntu on it
Apr 01 14:41:50 <JReagan1990>	DELL!!!
Apr 01 14:42:05 <boredandblogging>	robertj, or just let them try out the LiveCD
Apr 01 14:42:06 <JReagan1990>	if they will put ubuntu on there systems, we will see
Apr 01 14:42:31 <boredandblogging>	if with the LiveCD they can't browse the web or hear sound, they'll give up anyway
Apr 01 14:42:39 <robertj>	I think a familiarity exercise is good: "this is an Ubuntu CD, play with it, but don't wipe your HD"
Apr 01 14:42:47 <boredandblogging>	robertj, agreed
Apr 01 14:42:56 <JReagan1990>	agreed
Apr 01 14:43:05 <boredandblogging>	maybe remove the install icon from the liveCD
Apr 01 14:43:14 <JReagan1990>	Just to get people familiarized is certainly a good start
Apr 01 14:43:27 <robertj>	there will never be so much of a transition to FOSS as an exodus from proprietary software
Apr 01 14:44:20 <jsvh>	What version do we want to use for this? 6.06?
Apr 01 14:44:39 <JReagan1990>	That might be a good idea... for stability's sake
Apr 01 14:44:41 <boredandblogging>	6.06 is LTS, right?
Apr 01 14:44:48 <jsvh>	yes
Apr 01 14:44:55 <boredandblogging>	yeah, then 6.06
Apr 01 14:45:04 <JReagan1990>	supported until 2009
Apr 01 14:45:32 <boredandblogging>	ok, lets review, so we are talking of making a box, with all this stuff in it?
Apr 01 14:45:40 <JReagan1990>	yup
Apr 01 14:46:05 <boredandblogging>	with stickers on the outside that may rouse some kind of interest
Apr 01 14:46:05 <JReagan1990>	a box, with fliers and cd's attatched onto them
Apr 01 14:46:15 <boredandblogging>	on them or in them?
Apr 01 14:46:33 <boredandblogging>	you are right, on them would be better
Apr 01 14:47:15 <JReagan1990>	Bingo!  Have a nice large ubuntu logo on the outside of the box... maybe underneath on the stand
Apr 01 14:47:30 <robertj>	LTS is starting to look a bit dated
Apr 01 14:47:45 <robertj>	hardware detection is much improved under both edgy and feisty
Apr 01 14:48:06 <boredandblogging>	yeah, but edgy cause people a lot of problems
Apr 01 14:48:27 <robertj>	Feisty will be stable soon, it seems like the obvious choice
Apr 01 14:48:45 <robertj>	there is no procedure in place for getting updated drivers or kernels into LTS either, so its kinda deadish right now IMO
Apr 01 14:48:49 <JReagan1990>	yup... and when you think about it, Dapper is only 1 yr old
Apr 01 14:49:03 <boredandblogging>	possibly, all this is going to take a while to build out, Feisty will be out
Apr 01 14:49:09 <jsvh>	maybe, we will see how stable it is, I think 6.06 will still be the safe choice
Apr 01 14:49:10 <boredandblogging>	alright, Feisty it is
Apr 01 14:49:20 <JReagan1990>	cool
Apr 01 14:49:47 <jsvh>	we need atleast wait till Feisty is official
Apr 01 14:50:03 <robertj>	Feisty is going to be the most stable Ubuntu yet, no question
Apr 01 14:50:06 <JReagan1990>	just to clarify, the best box would be one that is preferably clear, and has a flap on it so that people can easily grab it
Apr 01 14:50:10 <boredandblogging>	right, Feisty comes out in a couple of weeks, this is all going to take more than a couple of weeks
Apr 01 14:50:45 <jsvh>	ok, sounds good then
Apr 01 14:51:07 <JReagan1990>	It will take some time to create the flyer, and I suggest that we use something like scribus... then take it to fedex kinko's, ups store, wherever
Apr 01 14:51:31 <boredandblogging>	and if we include screenshots or instructions, they should be easy enough to change if Feisty craps out
Apr 01 14:51:42 <JReagan1990>	If there are any better apps, lets use the best one
Apr 01 14:51:45 <robertj>	I'd suggest looking for stuff already done
Apr 01 14:51:53 <JReagan1990>	screenshots sound good
Apr 01 14:52:03 <boredandblogging>	yeah, look at the Ohio Team
Apr 01 14:52:14 <jsvh>	sounds good, we can setup a wiki and start putting info for the flyer on it
Apr 01 14:52:22 <boredandblogging>	I believe they have done some stuff with scribus
Apr 01 14:52:28 <boredandblogging>	their is DIY marketing site
Apr 01 14:52:38 <JReagan1990>	that sounds good
Apr 01 14:52:40 <boredandblogging>	that has posters and logos and stuff like that we can use
Apr 01 14:53:07 <JReagan1990>	Then we could customize it for our team!
Apr 01 14:53:09 <robertj>	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DIYMarketing and #ubuntu-marketing
Apr 01 14:53:27 <boredandblogging>	JReagan1990, definitely
Apr 01 14:53:28 <JReagan1990>	*checking it out*
Apr 01 14:55:23 <JReagan1990>	looks good.  They seem to have logo's and stuff, so I am not sure that we will have to ask canonical for logos
Apr 01 14:55:42 <boredandblogging>	as long as you don't change the logo, its fine
Apr 01 14:55:49 <JReagan1990>	sweet
Apr 01 14:55:54 <boredandblogging>	or put it on top of anything or anything underneath it
Apr 01 14:56:03 <JReagan1990>	That works.
Apr 01 14:56:24 <robertj>	brb
Apr 01 14:56:27 *	robertj has quit ("Ex-Chat")
Apr 01 14:56:28 <JReagan1990>	k
Apr 01 14:56:38 <boredandblogging>	ok, so jon, you wanna come up with a mockup of the box?
Apr 01 14:56:42 *	robertj (n=robertj@97.81.79.163) has joined #ubuntu-georgia
Apr 01 14:56:44 <JReagan1990>	sure
Apr 01 14:56:45 <boredandblogging>	and slap it on the wiki?
Apr 01 14:57:10 <JReagan1990>	I will go to the store and get the supplies.  I will then have to wait for the CD's to arrive.
Apr 01 14:58:09 <JReagan1990>	I will draw up adesign and put on a wiki page
Apr 01 14:58:15 <JReagan1990>	* a design
Apr 01 14:58:45 <JReagan1990>	I will try to get it uploaded by tonight
Apr 01 14:58:46 <boredandblogging>	shipit seems to be a bit slow...maybe we can get heathen to make some CDs with his wife's lightscribe CDR
Apr 01 14:59:14 <boredandblogging>	i still haven't gotten an email from shipit about the  order I made
Apr 01 14:59:17 <robertj>	nahh
Apr 01 14:59:20 <robertj>	locos get priority
Apr 01 14:59:23 <jsvh>	that sounds good, they should look official what ever we do
Apr 01 14:59:28 <JReagan1990>	We could... I was just thinking that the shipit cd's would fit better in the box, and would also have the offical ubuntu stuff on them
Apr 01 14:59:35 <robertj>	just order 200, send an email to the address, and they will show up quick
Apr 01 14:59:55 <JReagan1990>	OK... Sounds cool.
Apr 01 15:00:26 <JReagan1990>	How long does it take for shipit to show up?
Apr 01 15:00:27 <boredandblogging>	ok, but shipit is only doing free 6.06 LTS right now, right?
Apr 01 15:00:37 <JReagan1990>	I don't know.
Apr 01 15:00:42 <boredandblogging>	if we do Feisty, we'll have to burn those on our own
Apr 01 15:00:45 <JReagan1990>	I will find out.  Hold on
Apr 01 15:01:41 <JReagan1990>	yes, it is only the 6.06 cd's
Apr 01 15:01:58 <JReagan1990>	I could order just a few, and then do a trial run.
Apr 01 15:02:27 <boredandblogging>	does anyone have a lightscribe CDR?
Apr 01 15:02:40 <boredandblogging>	heathen can make some for us...
Apr 01 15:02:55 <boredandblogging>	and I can go buy one...kinda want one for no reason
Apr 01 15:03:44 <boredandblogging>	let's worry about the CDs later
Apr 01 15:03:57 <JReagan1990>	ok
Apr 01 15:04:00 <boredandblogging>	so the boxes need to be made up...
Apr 01 15:04:03 <boredandblogging>	along with flyers
Apr 01 15:04:08 <JReagan1990>	right
Apr 01 15:04:09 <boredandblogging>	and some instructions?
Apr 01 15:04:20 <boredandblogging>	and jsvh is getting the stickers
Apr 01 15:04:50 <JReagan1990>	I'll make up some instructions and see if I can get those up on the wiki
Apr 01 15:05:04 <JReagan1990>	I will put then on the page /marketing
Apr 01 15:05:26 <boredandblogging>	check the DIY and Ohio Team sites, thiink they've already worked on instructions for installing
Apr 01 15:05:58 <JReagan1990>	I will check there first.
Apr 01 15:06:41 <JReagan1990>	also, we could lead the new users to that page, which could include large amounts of info on what to do, and not to do
Apr 01 15:07:14 <JReagan1990>	stuff like "Check your hardware to ensure that it is working properly" or "how to dual boot"
Apr 01 15:07:42 <boredandblogging>	jsvh, I think we wait another 20 or 30 minutes for some people and then go through some of the stuff on the agenda...might need to just table it till next week
Apr 01 15:08:21 <jsvh>	ok sounds good nick
Apr 01 15:08:26 <boredandblogging>	JReagan1990, yeah, we'll play around with it, its easy enough to change
Apr 01 15:08:43 <JReagan1990>	cool. :)
Apr 01 15:09:16 <JReagan1990>	I guess we could tie in that info from the new user pages
Apr 01 15:09:39 <boredandblogging>	yup
Apr 01 15:11:26 <JReagan1990>	so are we going to wait another 20 min for folks to show up?
Apr 01 15:11:38 <boredandblogging>	yeah
Apr 01 15:12:14 <boredandblogging>	hey jsvh, any updates the release party
Apr 01 15:12:17 <JReagan1990>	k... in that case, I will be back in about 15 min.  I have to go move furnature :(
Apr 01 15:12:27 <boredandblogging>	ok
Apr 01 15:17:23 <boredandblogging>	hey robertj, thanks for the input on the ubuntu box, its been really helpful.
Apr 01 15:19:17 <jsvh>	We are going to have a CHUGALUG meeting Thursday I think, I will talk about it there
Apr 01 15:19:59 <boredandblogging>	cool
Apr 01 15:20:07 <jsvh>	I g2g, my roommates car broke down, I am going to pick him up, I will be back in a few hopefully
Apr 01 15:20:16 <boredandblogging>	awight
Apr 01 15:20:25 <robertj>	jsvh: later, check me around, im in Athens
Apr 01 15:20:29 *	jsvh has quit ("Ex-Chat")
Apr 01 15:20:46 <robertj>	CHUGALUG is too dorky even for me ;)
Apr 01 15:20:52 <boredandblogging>	haha
Apr 01 15:21:23 <boredandblogging>	we are sitting in IRC, nothing is too dorky for us
Apr 01 15:21:56 <robertj>	many people there are well past the point of eccentric geek into dysfunctional elitism
Apr 01 15:22:37 <robertj>	Theres been talk of a restructuring so maybe that will get addressed soon
Apr 01 15:22:49 <JReagan1990>	and I'm back
Apr 01 15:23:24 <boredandblogging>	lol, how big is the group?
Apr 01 15:24:26 <robertj>	dunno, when I went I think there were like 30-40ish in attendance
Apr 01 15:24:28 <robertj>	i only went a few times
Apr 01 15:25:35 <robertj>	ACM was pretty much the same faces too
Apr 01 15:25:44 <boredandblogging>	yeah, I bet...
Apr 01 15:26:21 <JReagan1990>	30-40 = not bad
Apr 01 15:26:55 <robertj>	I'm just not down with the someone stands up and talks format
Apr 01 15:27:14 <boredandblogging>	oh my
Apr 01 15:27:15 <robertj>	thats ok in Church, but it isn't what a LUG is supposed to be about
Apr 01 15:27:23 <JReagan1990>	lol... right
Apr 01 15:27:37 <boredandblogging>	thats pretty funny
Apr 01 15:27:46 <boredandblogging>	sounds like geek heirarchy
Apr 01 15:27:53 <robertj>	i'm more into the "lets go eat and we will probably end up talking about computers"
Apr 01 15:27:55 <JReagan1990>	lol
Apr 01 15:29:01 <boredandblogging>	I wonder if the ALE meetings are like that...I know some of the AJUG guys meet beforehand to eat
Apr 01 15:30:04 <JReagan1990>	crud.  I have to go move more furniture... the painters are coming tomorrow.  I will check back in a little later, around 4:00 or so.  TTYL
Apr 01 15:30:23 <boredandblogging>	its fine, I think I'm going to table the agenda for this week.
Apr 01 15:30:31 *	ClinicalMistake (n=justinb@host-12-173-142-83.nctv.com) has joined #ubuntu-georgia
Apr 01 15:30:43 <boredandblogging>	hey ClinicalMistake

Apr 01 15:31:07 <ClinicalMistake>	hey everyone, sorry im late ^^;;
Apr 01 15:31:15 <boredandblogging>	no biggie
Apr 01 15:31:18 <ClinicalMistake>	I was distracted by a java project
Apr 01 15:31:48 <boredandblogging>	seems like lots of java stuff going on, jsvh was asking about JDBC earlier
Apr 01 15:32:11 <ClinicalMistake>	oh yeah? sounds awesome
Apr 01 15:32:30 <ClinicalMistake>	hehe I only realized what time it was because I hit a snag :D
Apr 01 15:32:43 <boredandblogging>	haha
Apr 01 15:33:07 <boredandblogging>	justin, did you get a chance to work on a logo?
Apr 01 15:34:12 <ClinicalMistake>	well, yes and no.  I have all of the different images and I've looked at the rules, but I didnt get a chance to start on anything yet
Apr 01 15:34:15 <boredandblogging>	jon came up with an idea of making an Ubuntu box that will have stickers and CDs on it...think we can probably put an official Georgia LoCo logo on it too
Apr 01 15:34:28 <boredandblogging>	justin, thats ok
Apr 01 15:34:44 <boredandblogging>	maybe a sketch for next week?
Apr 01 15:34:46 <ClinicalMistake>	oh a box would be nice
Apr 01 15:34:56 <boredandblogging>	yeah, its a real good idea
Apr 01 15:35:06 <ClinicalMistake>	yeah, I planned to have one this week, but I get swamped sometimes :D
Apr 01 15:35:31 <boredandblogging>	yeah, don't worry about it
Apr 01 15:36:04 <ClinicalMistake>	the local LUG is meeting this week though, which is nice :D

Apr 01 15:38:36 <ClinicalMistake>	;) sounds like a plan
Apr 01 15:39:35 <boredandblogging>	ok, I think thats as much of the agenda as we can cover this week, we'll table the rest of it for next week and get some more updates.
