<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/irc-small.png]]</nowiki>  Georgia LoCo IRC Channel - Another option is to use Ubuntu Georgia's IRC channel, which is basically a chat room where you can talk to other Ubuntu users and team members in Georgia.  It is not always guaranteed that someone will be in, but be sure to ask your question to see if anyone is available.  See below for instructions on how to connect to the Ubuntu Georgia IRC channel:

==== IRC Support Instructions ====

We also offer live help via chat channels, called IRC. See the instructions below to connect to us.

1. Click on '''Applications > Internet > Pidgin''' (for versions older than 7.10, the instant messenger is called Gaim)

2. The first time that it is opened, you will be asked to add accounts to your messenger.

3. Click on the '''Add button > Select IRC from protocol list > Type in your desired screen name'''.

4. The server should already be set for irc.ubuntu.com and you can leave the password & alias blank.

5. Click on save. You will notice now in the accounts window yourscreename@irc.ubuntu.com

6. If it is not checked already, click on enable > a window will appear mentioning it is connecting you to IRC.

7. Once it connects, you will notice a chat box where you can type in anything, with the title freenode-connect.  Minimize this window.

8. From the "Buddy List" window, click on '''Buddies > Join a Chat...'''.  From inside this box, make sure your IRC account is selected, and enter '''#ubuntu-us-ga''' into the "Channel" box.  You do '''not''' need a password.

9. At that time you should immediately be in the official Georgia LoCo Chat room.
