London, October 18, 2007 – ''The Ubuntu project has released the latest version of their operating system for desktops, laptops, servers, and now mobile devices.''

	The Ubuntu project has released Ubuntu 7.10, codename Gutsy Gibbon.  The focus of this release was new features, including improvements in speed and reliability.  Compiz, the window manager that includes transparency and animated desktop switching, has been included by default in Ubuntu 7.10.  Other new features includes an all-new version of OpenOffice.org, version 2.3, with many new features including support for useful extensions available from OpenOffice.org web site.

Printing could also not be any easier, with plug-n-play support for most printers.  Ubuntu also includes a new version of the Gnome Desktop Environment, version 2.20.  

        This release of Ubuntu is supported for 18 months, with paid support from Canonical Ltd., or with free support from the Ubuntu community.

Ubuntu's release cycle is once of every six months, with an Long Term Release (LTS) release every two years.  

        Ubuntu is an ancient African word that translates roughly to “Humanity towards others.”  It is this thinking that drives Ubuntu's large community of users devoted to helping others get started with Ubuntu.  Ubuntu provides the best Open Source Software available, as well as the ease-of-use that Ubuntu is famous for delivering.
