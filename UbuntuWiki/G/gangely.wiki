Welcome on my home page on Ubuntu Wiki. 

I'm not yet involved in any Ubuntu dev group and these pages will be at first used to gather my notes about computing, Linux and Debian|Ubuntu.

As such, I see these pages as an opportunity to share my personal notes and to be a support for discussions and mail exchanges about Linux and Ubuntu.
