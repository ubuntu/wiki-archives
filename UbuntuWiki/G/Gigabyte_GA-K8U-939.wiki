__TOC__

Everything I could test is working OK out-of-the-box, including network, sound.
Tested on Kubuntu 6.06 to 8.04. Last two versions are amd64.

* ******************************************************************
If anyone uses lm-sensors, there is a little problem with /etc/sensors.conf (or /etc/sensors3.conf), which requires manual correction of chip "smsc47m1-*" and chip "smsc47m192-*" configuration:

1. Enabling fan control
original:
changed to:
    set fan1_min 1700
    set fan2_min 1300

    label fan1 "CPU fan"
    label fan2 "GPU fan"

2. Uncomment:
ignore in7
as it shows strange value

3. Correct CPU temperature:
compute temp2 (@-20), (@+20)
after this change the temperature shown by lm-sensors is close to the temperature shown by BIOS.
