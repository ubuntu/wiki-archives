=== Gordon Stevens ===
I have been a computer user, a Computer Support Specialist, a Computer Design Analys... etc etc, for many years; I have made a return to linux.

I have always felt my true calling lies within the Physical Sciences, but time will tell.

I was born and I live in Ontario, Canada.

My contributions to Ubuntu are bug reports, but more importantly, I translate for my native languages,
English (Canada) and English (British). I can read and understand almost all modern dialects of English,
but I find it difficult to make translations outside of my native English languages. (Ex: en_CA -> en_US, etc)
