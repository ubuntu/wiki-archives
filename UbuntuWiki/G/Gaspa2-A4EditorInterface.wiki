== Editor Interface ==

=== Abstract: ===

the aim of this blueprint should be to set up a complete and usable Editor Interface.
A simple list of points could be as follows:
* decide a list of tools that should be visible in a A4/svg editor
* decide how these tools should behave
* decide what's the behaviour in the drawing area

=== Specifications ===

* how tools should behave, create some stub code for the tools:
*** menu/toolbar
*** how handle create selection, how handle selected objects.
*** how to add objects to our represantation.

* some usability thoughts:
** which tools are usefu

* code practices:
** use cases
** is there some other svg editor (even not svg, if our representation is enough 'abstract')?
** code something (of course:P )
