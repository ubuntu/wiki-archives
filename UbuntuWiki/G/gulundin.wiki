=== About Me ===

My namne is Gustav Lundin and I live in the city of Sala, Sweden. I started to use Ubuntu 2010 and my first expression was that I hated it. But I didn't loved Windows either so I gave it a second chance and now I use Ubuntu as my primary operative system on nearby all my computers. I am a computer geek, who is also interested in graphic design and open source contribution.

Since 2012, I work (as volunteer) to establish the Open Source Museum at Sätra Brunn, outside Sala. It will use open source technology to visualise and present digital content, it will open in 2015!
