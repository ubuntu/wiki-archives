'''Ghormax''' is a fresh Ubuntu-Linux User. So far, I am very happy with the change. I would recommend it to everyone. With the latest version (7.10), Ubuntu again made progress. I would never switch back to Windows. I hope that one day Ubuntu will be able to challenge Windows head on and that MS does not use its power to suppress this marvelous operating system.
