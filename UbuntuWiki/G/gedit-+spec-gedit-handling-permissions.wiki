== Handling permissions . ==

 {o} '''Read-only files''' - Currently when you open a file that you don't have write access to gedit doesn't give you a hint. you can edit the file normally and stuff but when you want to save you can't (as you don't have permission). <<BR>> 

   {*} Workaround <<BR>> 
**** Gedit should notify the user that the file is read-only to him and prevent editing. Ideally the user would get a red bar at the top of the file pane where he can select "switch to root" which then asks for the password and unlocks the text area. <<BR>> 

 {o} '''Non-Existing files''' - If we issue a command "$gedit /non-existing-file" via terminal , an empty gedit will open . The user is not notified . <<BR>> 

   {*} Workaround <<BR>> 
**** Gedit should notify the user that the file is not existing , and prompt to create the file . <<BR>>
