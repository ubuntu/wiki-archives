My name is Adam Glenn and I go by the nickname Gekitsuu. I have been interested in Linux since the mid 90's and have decided that I am long over due for giving back to the community. Ubuntu quickly became my favorite distro and have had it installed on machines since Warty. To learn more about me please visit my website http://www.gekitsuu.org .
