=== Project ===

* Project Name: Quickly and importing snippet

* Project Description By Mentor: <<BR>>
         Quickly can be integrated with the python-snippet project to allow user to integrate some code on them.
     Like "adding dbus support" and that would select and propose the corresponding snippets, a library that 
     can be plugged into templates and as a gedit plugin will be great. <<BR>>  <<BR>>
  
 To know more about snippets and adding our own snippets:
     http://www.jonobacon.org/2010/03/22/quick-acire-and-python-snippets-guide/ <<BR>> <<BR>>

 My Description about this Project:  <<BR>>
     We are going to do one plugin to gedit which contain "Snippet" in menu bar. The Snippet contains the following,<<BR>> <<BR>>
    
1.See/Read Snippet 
       (Using this we can drag and drop into gedit text field area to view and edit the code of corresponding snippets)<<BR>>
2.Import Snippets ( Importing snippets from the public launchpad domain )<<BR>>
3.Update snippets (Update the snippets from the public launchpad domain ) <<BR>>
4.Share Snippet ( It shares to public launchpad domain )<<BR>><<BR>>
     user can change the snippet import / update / share launchpad url at any time. <<BR>>
     So, this project is a workflow design  "import/ update /share snippets related to dbus" in an effective way and have to integrate it  in gedit. <<BR>> <<BR>> <<BR>>

* Why did you like this idea?<<BR>>

      I am more interested to work with Glade, also impressed by "Quickly" too.
  I would like to contribute to Quickly and gedit. gedit, is one of my favourite text editor which i use in my day-to-day life. If i do this project, i can get a chance to study the source code of gedit and quickly, to contribute to it. <<BR>><<BR>><<BR>>   
						 

* Please describe a tentative project architecture or an approach to it:<<BR>><<BR>><<BR>>

      This plug-in is going to add a new option in gedit called "Snippet" on its Menu Bar.<<BR>><<BR>>

      Added "Snippet" consists of following options.<<BR>>

1. Import Snippets<<BR>>

2. Update Snippets<<BR>>

3. Share Snippet<<BR>> <<BR>>

 

     To do all the above processes , we have to use commands in terminal and browse launchpad domain till now.<<BR>>

     After finished this project , in "gedit" itself we have GUI option to do all the above processes.<<BR>><<BR>>

     Here i explained about how one developer going to share their snippet to launchpad domain via commands and launchpad procedures.<<BR>><<BR>><<BR>>

1. Import Snippets :<<BR>>

     First, we need to grab the Python Snippets library from Launchpad<<BR>>

         $ bzr branch lp:python-snippets

     The above command will grab all the python-snippet from launchpad and download it in to current directory.<<BR>><<BR>>

3. Share Snippet :<<BR>>

     Assume we created our own snippet . Now its ready to share.<<BR>>

     We now need to add our file in our branch using the add command.<<BR>>

     Add :

         $ bzr add your-snippet.py<<BR>><<BR>>

     Now, commit our changes to our local branch with the following command:<<BR>>

     Commit :

         $ bzr commit

     Now nano editor is opened to save the information about commit changes.

     Here we need to type our commit log message .<<BR>><<BR>><<BR>>

     The following 3 steps are initial setups to share our file to launchpad.<<BR>><<BR>>

         Step 1:<<BR>>

         Now we are going to generate our own Public RSA Key to share our program in launchpad.
         It will help to download other user.<<BR>>
 

         $ ssh-keygen -t rsa<<BR>><<BR>>

         Step 2:<<BR>>

          Now we need to copy the our Public RSA Key from ~/.ssh folder.<<BR>><<BR>>

         Step 3 :<<BR>>

         Now we need to paste the copied content ( public key ) in our launchpad ssh key.<<BR>><<BR>>

         Login to our launchpad account and grab the create/edit ssh key .<<BR>>
         Paste the copied content in "public key line" in our launchpad ssh key page<<BR>><<BR>>

         Now SSH Public Key is successfully added.<<BR>><<BR>>

         Here after we can upload many times our snippets into our launchpad account.  The past 3 steps for one/first time   process. Then launchpad will remember our home folder and its .ssh public key. So no need to do the above 3 steps        while doing next snippet upload/share from this system.<<BR>><<BR>>

*** Share Snippet : ( continued ... )<<BR>>
    
        Already we added our snippet and committed to our local bazzar.<<BR>>
 
        Propose it for merging<<BR>>

        So, now push it to our own branch on Launchpad:  <<BR>>

             $ bzr push lp:~<your launchpad username>/python-snippets/<name of your branch> <<BR>>

        Now we need to login launchpad account and then have to write description about the sharing snippet and finally do
        the propose for merging.<<BR>><<BR>><<BR>>

* Proposal of this project :<<BR>>
    We have seen above , how one developer can share their snippet to public domain.<<BR>>

    All the commands and launchpad processes are done in "gedit" plug-in itself.<<BR>>

**** User no need to give commands and no need to browse the launchpad page.<<BR>>

**** Everything should be customized in gedit gui itself.<<BR>>

   To synchronize with launchpad from gedit , we are going to use some "API" libraries.<<BR>>

   By this way ,<<BR>>
   user can do the following options in gedit . . .<<BR>>
1. Import Snippets <<BR>>
            Freshly download snippets from the public launchpad domain . Here URL will be given by the user.<<BR>>

2. Update Snippets<<BR>>

                The snippets are uploaded and upgraded for everyday. So using this option , user can update their snippets    with current snippets which are uploaded in launchpad. Here user can use the URL of launchpad/python-snippets domain as default if user like or they can change the url.<<BR>>

3. Share Snippet<<BR>>

     User can do<<BR>>

****** Add snippet<<BR>>
****** Commit snippet<<BR>>
****** Importing public rsa key from user system to launchpad account<<BR>>
****** Upload snippet to user launchpad account<<BR>>
****** Push snippet from user launchpad account to public launchpad domain ( i.e. to be shared domain )                             <<BR>>
****** Propose for merging<<BR>>
****** Write description, commit log and etc<<BR>>
****** Merging snippet with public library<<BR>>
****** extra ( if need we can include some other options also )<<BR>><<BR>><<BR>>

 

       User can do all the above things via gedit gui options. The last 5 options will be done by using launchpad API and combine with gedit plug-in.<<BR>>

  Features :<<BR>>

*** User can give their needed launchpad url to share their snippets .<<BR>>
*** While Importing / uploading / Sharing their snippets , user can use previously used launchpad url by enabling "Default"
      option or they can set new url .<<BR>>
*** Plug-in will remember the past used url links to import / upload/ shared snippets .<<BR>><<BR>>

* Why will your proposal benefit Ubuntu?<<BR>>
   "Quickly" is launched in the upcoming versions of Ubuntu (from ubuntu 9.10). So this is begining stage for "Quickly". <<BR>>
    If my proposal is accepted, Quickly can be improved, inorder to benefit further releases.
  

=== Open Source ===

* Please describe any previous Open Source development experience<<BR>>

   My final year project is " Contour Analysis And Visualization ". Using CDAT ( Climate Data Analysis And Tool ) we can plot isolines over world map. I wrote a vcsaddon/plugin to CDAT. That is creating dynamic isotherm lines over any region on world map. 
  CDAT Link: http://www2-pcmdi.llnl.gov/cdat  <<BR>>
  In my project i created current Isotherm lines over our Cdat-India Map. by continus study on plotting current isotherm lines over map, a meteorologist can analysis and predict the climate changes.<<BR>>
  By adding few files in my plugin, any one can plot current Isotherm lines over any continents/country.<<BR>><<BR>>
  Here is I host my project source code:<<BR>>
