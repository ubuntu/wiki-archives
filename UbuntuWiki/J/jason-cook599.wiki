== About Me ==
My name is Jason Cook. I live in Kitchener, Ontario, Canada. I will be starting Grade 10 in September.

== Ubuntu Contributions ==
I have done several things for Ubuntu. I am one of the editors on the Ubuntu Manual team. I co-write for <nowiki>[[http://www.ubunturoot.com/|Ubuntu Root]]</nowiki> which covers various topics such as Ubuntu news, app reviews, themes and wallpapers. I have also made some forum posts which you can find <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/search.php?do=finduser&u=912634|here]]</nowiki>

I joined the <nowiki>[[http://ubuntu-manual.org/|Ubuntu Manual]]</nowiki> <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/ubuntu-manual|Launchpad team]]</nowiki> shortly after hearing about it from the <nowiki>[[http://omgubuntu.co.uk/|OMG! Ubuntu!]]</nowiki>. The Ubuntu Manual team creates a beginners manual for every release of Ubuntu. We cover basic topics such as installation to more advanced troubleshooting. Since joining I have fixed many bugs. You can see all the bugs I have fixed <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/~jason-cook599/+bugs?field.status:list=FIXCOMMITTED&field.status:list=FIXRELEASED&assignee_option=choose&field.assignee=jason-cook599|here]]</nowiki> and all bug assigned to me, but not yet fixed <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/~jason-cook599/+assignedbugs|here]]</nowiki>.

I started writing for <nowiki>[[http://ubunturoot.com/|Ubuntu Root]]</nowiki> recently on August 21, 2010. I have posted on various topics such as Steam for Linux, Ubuntu Manual and reviews of various apps.

== Other Technical Contributions ==
I am a member of the Media Team at my Church. I run live HD cameras for one of our two services. At our youth group every Friday night, I run graphics through<nowiki>[[http://www.renewedvision.com/propresenter.php|ProPresenter]]</nowiki>. On other nights I will run lights from our <nowiki>[[http://www.jandsvista.com/|Jans Vista]]</nowiki> lighting board.

= Ideas for Ubuntu = 
Ubuntu is a fantastic operating system. It is very usable and thus the only things I change are themes, wallpaper ''few'' applications. Most my ideas revolve around the installer.
* Installer
** Add PPAs during installation
** Install applications during installation
** Connect to WiFi instead of Ethernet for APT configuration
** Document Transfer
** Copy '''selected''' folders to your fresh install
*** The documents would be put in a folder name OLD for each user
*** This allows you to choose that you want to have on you fresh install
*** This lets you keep you documents without keeping settings

== Favorite Blogs ==

I subscribes to over 100 blogs, with an average over 2,000 post a month. It is hard to narrow it down to a few, but I will try.<<BR>>
