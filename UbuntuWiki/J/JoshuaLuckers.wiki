=== About Me ===
 I'm a Linux user since 2005. First I tried openSUSE but switched in 2006 to Ubuntu. 
 I study computer science and own a webhosting & software company named Sensiva.
 My mother language is Dutch.

=== My Involvement ===
 I am involved with BugSquad, helping users at IRC, reporting bugs in Alpha, Beta and Stable releases. I also try to convince people in real life to start using Ubuntu and report any issues and ideas they have to improve Ubuntu. 

=== My Vision ===
 I plan to become an Ubuntu Member. I want to achieve this by getting an Ubuntu Bug Control team member and eventually maintain (a) package(s) or write applications for Ubuntu myself.
