=== Future Goals ===

My goal is to inspire others, especially youths in the community, by sharing Ubuntu through events, education, and 100% free software multimedia projects. I want Ubuntu to be associated with "fun". I want Ubuntu events to attract those from the other side of the chasm. I want to grow Ubuntu. 

=== Testimonials ===

If you know me and have something nice to say, please leave a comment here.

Joe Liau joined Ubuntu Vancouver in the spring of 2009 and began contributing almost immediately. He contributed to our group consistently and with artistry. He has presented Ubuntu topics dozens of times at Ubuntu Vancouver events. He has  helped to organize parties and other social events that are designed to spread and promote Ubuntu. Joe lives and breathes the Ubuntu ethos and I recommend him wholeheartedly for Ubuntu membership. I am confident that he will serve the project well and help bring Ubuntu to the masses, in a fun way.

Joseph has been an invaluable contributor to the Avaneya project in creating concept artwork and as a think tank. He's also presented some very original and creative ideas at Ubuntu Vancouver meetings and we're all very grateful for his presence.

Thanks to Joe, I and many others found out about Ubuntu and the local community, and our Ubuntu parties were always way more successful.  He has an awesome desire to learn and grow which has inspired me and others to do the same.  Thanks, Joe.
