'''Email:''' jeremie.corbier@resel.enst-bretagne.fr

I am a French engineering student at ENST Bretagne (http://www.enst-bretagne.fr). I am also one of the network and systems administrators of the ResEl (http://resel.enst-bretagne.fr).

I have been using Ubuntu since Warty was released and I am used to working with Debian-based systems (11 servers running Debian Woody, then Sarge).

== Contributions ==

* I packaged a DHCPv6 solution for Dapper.

* I'm often on irc.freenode.net, helping out in #ubuntu-fr and #ubuntu. I also try to participate in #ubuntu-motu and #ubuntu-bugs.

* I've filed a few bug reports and whenever I can, I try to provide patches (denemo, ...).

* I'm part of the Ubuntu French Translation Team, at https://launchpad.net/people/ubuntu-l10n-fr

== Future plans ==

* Package some more networking applications.

* Squash bugs as much as I can.

* Help REVUing packages.

* Keep on helping people in IRC, especially in #ubuntu-fr.
