=== About me ===

I am known as 'DarkED' or 'Darkus Edius' in most circles.

I'm a gamer mostly. I've been using various flavors of Linux for about three years now. I do alot of level design for various game engines, namely Unreal Engine versions 1.x-2.x, along with some 3D modelling and HTML/CSS. I also like to pass the time working on my cars. I really love Ubuntu and I want to contribute, but since I'm no coder I try to do various things to help out :D

=== Interests ===

* Computers in general.
* Games, mostly FPS and RPG flavors.
* Modding my cars.
* Unreal Engine games and development, mainly Level Design.
* Graphic Design and Drafting. Also, hand-drawn art sometimes.
* Web Design.
* Music, playing guitar and synthing with my workstation.
