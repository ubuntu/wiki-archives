==== About Me ====
Currently, I'm a web developer and designer specializing in creating applications in Java and PHP. Also, I'm learning <nowiki>[[http://github.com/jledbetter|Ruby/Rails]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[http://github.com/jledbetter|Python/Django]]</nowiki>. I've been using Linux for years and Ubuntu for a few cycles. One of the things I love most about Ubuntu is its community. I firmly believe in creating as welcoming an environment as possible for a diverse open source community and do what I can to help foster that. Other than technical fun, I'm also a Toastmaster and Board member for my local public library.

My current goals include creating an outline for <nowiki>[[http://new.p2pu.org|teaching programmers how to develop in Python]]</nowiki> with a focus on contributing to open source projects, and getting Virginia "approved" status.

==== Testimonials ====

 {*} Jessica has been the de-facto leader of the Virginia Local Community Team for many months now. Her efforts to lead the meetings, send out status reports, and rekindle activity are admirable. It's clear she is passionate about FOSS and Ubuntu. She brings a high level of dedication and activity to any organization she is a member of, putting in long hours of sustained effort towards her projects. She's a voracious learner and loves to speak about technology and Ubuntu. She brings success anywhere she applies herself. I can't wait to see how far she goes. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:jtatum]]</nowiki> 
 {*} jtatum is a good judge of character and Jessica will bring both skill and passion. I wish her well. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:tarvid]]</nowiki> 
 {*} I have personally received a great deal of support and guidance in my early ventures in the Ubuntu Community. She is very welcoming and knowledgeable, a very approachable person. This was very helpful to me as a new contributor. She is always happy to help, or if she can't, she has always helped point people in the right direction. I think she'd make a great addition to any leadership group. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:cheri703]]</nowiki> 
 {*} I've worked with jledbetter in UW, Web Team, and a few other projects.  I've found her to be very friendly and encouraging presence.  Definitely, what I'd like to see in a leader.  She's always either known things I've seen people ask or gone out of her way to find out.  I support her candidacy for UBT Council and I think she'd make a great council member -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:nigelbabu]]</nowiki>
