__TOC__

Greetings!  I first installed Ubuntu Hoary Hedgehog in 2005, and have been an avid linux user ever since.  I have tried many different distributions, but I keep coming back to Ubuntu for several reasons, which I hope to expound on later.

I am currently a Computer Engineering student at Clemson University, and plan to focus on software engineering.  In my free time, I would like to start contributing to Ubuntu in any way I can, as it has given so much to me over the years.  My flavor of choice is Xubuntu, and I have joined the Xubuntu Documentation team at Launchpad in hopes that maybe I can help and learn and the same time.
