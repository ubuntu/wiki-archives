The search field for the Unity Reddit Lens is basically a filter for Reddit categories so if for instance you want to see the top stories in the /r/technology category, search for "technology"...

=== Pirate Bay Scope &amp; Torrent Lens ===

=== Unity Bliss Lens ===

This lens puts applications into category folders in the dash, similar to the old GNOME 2 Applications menu categories.

According to Mikkel Kamstrup Erlandsen (the lens' creator) from <nowiki>[[http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/11/unity-bliss-an-alternative-application-lens-for-ubuntu/| this OMG! Ubuntu article]]</nowiki>: 

“This is a very simple implementation of an apps lens for Unity. It can be used as a replacement for the default apps lens if you want something simpler, or it can be used as a solid starting point for writing your own lens.

Bliss is by no means official or anything. It is a quick hack to showcase how you can go about this, mostly intended for developers who want to do their own thing. That is also why you wont find a PPA for it (not from me at least)”

http://i.stack.imgur.com/QJTVN.jpg

'''Instructions for installation:'''

## Download the package from https://launchpad.net/unity-lens-bliss by clicking the green button on the right side of the page.
## Extract the package into your home folder.
## Run the following in a terminal: <pre>
cd unity-lens-bliss-0.1.3 ./configure –prefix=/usr –sysconfdir=/etc make sudo make install 
</pre>
1. Log out and back in to see it in the Dash.

=== Recoll Lens ===

Recoll is a full text search desktop tool which indexes the contents of many file formats including OpenOffice, MS Office, PostScript, MP3 and other audio files, JPEG and more. Besides regular searches, Recoll also lets you perform some advanced operations like searching for the author, file size, file format as well as operators like "AND" or "OR".

Unity Recoll Lens lets you use Recoll from Dash, without having to open any additional GUI. The lens comes with a few filters like Text, Spreadsheet, Presentation, Media or Message, but for more advanced searches, you'll have to manually enter the Recoll search query. Examples: author:"john doe" metallica OR megadeth /2007 (all documents from 2007 or older) dir:/path/to/dir (filters content from /path/to/dir directory)

http://i.stack.imgur.com/0AeSV.png

''Installation''

Unity Recoll Lens is available in the Recoll backports PPA for Ubuntu 11.10 and 11.04. To add the PPA and install Unity Recoll Lens, use the following commands:

<pre>
 sudo add-apt-repository ppa:recoll-backports/recoll-1.15-on sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install recoll-lens recoll 
</pre>

Once installed, you'll have to start the Recoll GUI (just search for Recoll in Dash) and let it index your files. Once it finishes, log out, then log back in and you should see a new Recoll search lens. The Recoll search results don't show up just on the Recoll lens but also on the home Dash, when performing a global search.

=== Spotify scope ===

Spotify scope adds extra resources to Ubuntu's default Unity Music lens, displaying Spotify songs when a particular item is searched.

Spotify scope depends on spotify-client-qt, tool that must be installed before the scope.

A definitely interesting innovation about the above mentioned scope is the marking of its items, meaning one can easily differentiate between songs provided by Banshee and Spotify's, the latter featuring a Spotify symbolic icons.

The usage is simple, properly oriented towards its corespondent application, meaning, playing a Spotify song is as simple as clicking on it (the item will be opened via the Spotify client).

http://i.stack.imgur.com/BKv58.png

Install

First, install the Spotify client (<nowiki>[[http://repository.spotify.com/pool/non-free/s/spotify/| download the package]]</nowiki> and install it via Ubuntu Software Center). 

<pre>
 sudo add-apt-repository ppa:scopes-packagers/ppa sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install unity-scope-spotify
