__TOC__

Thrust into the Linux/Unix world for a job I've found that I don't miss that other operating system one bit.  Always love a good challenge and feel that my level of understanding in the Linux OS is finally thorough enough to allow for input rather then just output.  I've also found that I really enjoy my interaction with Ubuntu.  I want to be a healthy, contributing member of the Ubuntu community.  Keep your fingers crossed!
