__TOC__

Based on the information gethered here on this page, i will create a command line application from these foundings in C/C++ so that Ubuntu linux can operate with Sony mp3 walkmans. Not only the walkman im revercing (Network Walkman NW-HD1) but mini-disc players and some other sony devices use the same file structures.

== xxINFOxx.DAT ==

These files seem to contain information about the song titles and album names on the walkman`s display.
These files are located in the OMGAUDIO directory, this directory contains file types like the following.

* xxGTRLST.DAT
* xxTREExx.DAT
* xxTREINF.DAT
* xxINFOxx.DAT
* xxCNTINF.DAT
* xxCHINDC.DAT
