== About Me ==
I first started using Linux in March 2004 with Mandrake 9.1.  Before Ubuntu, I'd also tried Red Hat 9.  I started using Ubuntu shortly after Ubuntu 4.10 (Warty) was released and have been using Ubuntu ever since.  I've tried Fedora and Gentoo alongside Ubuntu, and currently use Ubuntu 8.10 (Intrepid).

I started programming in late 2000, when I started learning Visual Basic 6.  Currently, I can use the following languages and scripting languages:
* Java
* C
* Python
* PHP
* Perl
* BASH

I spend my time on the forums trying to help users with problems, primarily in Absolute Beginner Talk, General Help, and Security Discussions.  I focus mostly on unanswered posts, although I do go looking for answered threads not yet marked as Solved to see if I can help there.
