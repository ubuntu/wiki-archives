== About me ==
Well, I'm a student, a designer, eye candy lover. I have been using ubuntu since January, 2005, and have never looked back (coming from a Windows world, with one or two years of fiddling around with Debian, Fedora, SuSE before that).

== Open Source contribution ==
I am running the website http://open-source.ecchi.ca
It holds a few tips, articles, and primitive applications I wrote while learning Python.

=== Specto: unobtrusive notifier ===

<nowiki>[[File:specto_logo.png]]</nowiki> 

I am the originator of the Specto project, a desktop application for GNOME that aims to notify you of whatever you care about (websites, email, IM, updates, when your dog is hungry, etc), in a discrete way, and only when needed.

Take a look or join us on http://specto.sourceforge.net !
