__TOC__

I design hydraulic systems on Windows based machines at the company that I work for, but I primarily run Linux on my home computers.

My desktop on my main computer is Kubuntu. I started using linux with RedHat, Mandrake and Gentoo back in 2002 but I switched to Kubuntu with Dapper.

I have done some programming with C, C++ and Java. I have been toyed around some with Python and Bash.

I have worked a good deal with docbook. I have been interested in improving the documentation in Linux and have written two handbooks for games that have been accepted in the KDE distribution. I also have in interest in programming/packaging for Ubuntu/Kubuntu.
