=== About Me ===
I am a 32 year old Manufacturing Engineer.  My undergraduate is in Network and Communications Management.  You might wonder why I am working as a manufacturing Engineer with the Degree I have.  Its simple, When I finished School I had a family and Entry Level IT wasn't going to cut it.  As a manufacturing Engineer I was making double what I was getting offered in IT.  I am Currently on my MBA with a focus on Network and Communications.  I spent 7 years in the Army where I spent most my time working on Electronic Guidence systems and Night Vision.  No, I wan't one of those guys that had stuff shipped back to him at the depot, I was on the lines with the bradley fighting vehicles.  My entire work experiance has been electronics and computers.

I have been using Linux on and off for about 8 years.  About a year ago I had finally had all the Microsoft I could take and I found Ubuntu.  I have not looked back since.  My home network server is running Ubuntu 6.10 and My laptop and desktops are running Ubuntu (gnome).  I have a windows box and I am preparing to build a windows 2003 server.  I have those only because I am working on starting a side business for system repair. Don't have the details all worked out yet.  When I move into my new house I plan to get things rolling.

In my spare time I love to spend time with my family, Hiking, Biking, Camping, most anything outside.  I also spend time Gaming (world of warcraft). And as you can imagine I spend a considerable amount of time exploring and customising Linux.
