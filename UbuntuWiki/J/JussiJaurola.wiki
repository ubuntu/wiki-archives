=== About Me ===

I am a 29 year old open source software ethuniasist. I have been using Linux since 1996 (Slackware, Debian, Red Hat, Ubuntu). I spend my days working as a System Specialist at Konehuone Oy and nights & weekends with Ubuntu. I currently live in Helsinki, Finland with my lovely wife Mira.

=== Summary of contributions to Ubuntu ===
My main contributions have been in the supporting users in #ubuntu, #ubuntu-server and #ubuntu-fi for several years (since 2006). I am also working on BugSquad to find out bugs and I am active member in the Finnish LoCo team.
