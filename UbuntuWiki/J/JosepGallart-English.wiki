I'm a person involved in <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CatalanTeam/difusio | spreading Free Software]]</nowiki>, I hold <nowiki>[[http://www.racocatala.cat/forum/llegir.php?idf=5&fil=2555&llindar=1&mode=2&pag=1&idmsg=1399355 | conferences]]</nowiki> and do courses and private lessons about Free Software and anything related to Internet.

I've created the local group <nowiki>[[http://www.new.facebook.com/home.php#/group.php?gid=40731449600&ref=ts | Inhabitants of Caldes for Free Software (Calderins pel programari lliure)]]</nowiki> which aims to be a tool to disseminate Free Software in general, and more particularly Ubuntu. We have two recurring activities:

 1. <nowiki>[[http://www.new.facebook.com/home.php#/event.php?eid=127822963276&index=1|Free Software breakfasts]]</nowiki>

 2. <nowiki>[[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wypWiTwY-Yc | Presentation of the latest Ubuntu release and Install Party]]</nowiki>. We have repeated this activity in different cities, like Cardedeu.

We want to spread the use of Ubuntu at the <nowiki>[[http://www.lafarga.cat/noticies/lajuntament-de-caldes-de-montbui-treballa-la-implantacio-del-programari-lliure|government.]]</nowiki>
