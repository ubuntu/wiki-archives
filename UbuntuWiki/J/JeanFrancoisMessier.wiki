__TOC__

I am a fan of Linux and Ubuntu. My main challenges are getting Ubuntu working with my existing hardware, on each new version. So far, the problems have been different from one version to another, and I try to maintain my list of fixes on my blog: http://www.messier.ca/wordpress.

I have a University degree in computer science, and work in computer security. I also do presentation on Linux topics in the local Linux user groups, and am involved in translating a multi-platform software.
