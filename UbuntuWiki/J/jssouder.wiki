=== About Me ===
I've been using Ubuntu since Jaunty. I bought a netbook and decided to give Ubuntu a whirl, immediately loved it, and have been using it ever since. Since I've enjoyed Ubuntu so much, I want to start working with the BugSquad to improve everyone's Ubuntu experience.

=== Interests ===
I am interested in any aspect which I can learn.

=== Timezone ===
USA/Chicago GMT -6

=== Availability ===
I'm a manager for a retail video game store, so my hours vary, but generally I'm available after 00:00 UTC
