__TOC__

Linux user since 2000; Ubuntu user since 2007. Previously used Debian and various PPC distributions. 

I occasionally file bug reports and participate in the forums but would like to do more (none-coding) for the community and am open to suggestions such as bug-testing and maintaining documentation and websites. By day, I run a various web applications on a Red Hat server at the University of Lincoln. I'm interested in the use of open source software for education.
