==== About Me ====
 I am somewhat mildly new to Ubuntu (but not so much now), but think it is the best Linux out there. I live in north-eastern Ohio. I would love to get more involved with Ubuntu and open-source in general. I have already been converting people over from Windows and have distributed Ubuntu CDs... when it doesn't get in the way of school, of course. I am part of the OhioTeam Ubuntu Loco Team!

==== Experience ====
 I have experience with PHP, Coldfusion, MySQL, HTML/CSS, Javascript/AJAX, C++, Python, and Java. The last three I am working on learning more about. I currently work as a student web programmer.
