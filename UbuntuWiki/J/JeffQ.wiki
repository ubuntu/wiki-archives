==== Linux experience ====

I'm an old Unix veteran, but only started dabbling with Linux (Fedora Core 6) in 2006 and began serious work on with Ubuntu 7.04 ("Feisty Fawn") in September 2007. I'm experimenting with a ThinkPad T23, so I hope to contribute to <nowiki>[[LaptopTestingTeam/ThinkpadT23-2647]]</nowiki>. Eventually I plan to move all my systems to Linux.

==== Community experience ====

No Ubuntu community experience yet. I've got considerable experience with Wikimedia projects, which means I'll be stumbling around for a while as I learn MoinMoin wiki. (First up: where the heck do I find links to my subscribed pages, or whatever the MoinMoin equivalent of Mediawiki's "My watchlist" is?)

==== IT experience ====

I've worked in information technology in a number of different capacities for a quarter of a century, mostly in technical development, architecture consulting, and technical sales support.
