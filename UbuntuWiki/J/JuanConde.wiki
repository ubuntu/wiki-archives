__TOC__

I work for the Andalusian (south of Spain) Government's distribution Guadalinex .

Guadalinex's presente version is based on Ubuntu Breezy.

Guadalinex's next version will be based on Edgy.

Guadalinex has been deployed in some 400.000 computers in schools, internet access centers, public libraries, homes, etc.
