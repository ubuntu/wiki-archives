=== Intro ===

I am a 26 year-old Systems Administrator in a Data Center for an Airline Services company.  I live in Atlanta, GA, USA.  I am single (Hi, ladies), <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pescetarian#Pescetarianism|pescetarian]]</nowiki>, and a voracious consumer of music (primarily Funk, Soul, and Hip-Hop).

=== Linux Info ===

I have been using Linux since 1998.  My first install was RedHat 4.2.  I then quickly moved on to Slackware, which I ran for several years.  Then, it was on to a brief affair with Gentoo, though I found myself compiling things more than I was actually using the system.  Along came this young, upstart distro named "Ubunutu" with a release titled "Warty Warthog", and here I am.

At work, I am on a team of Admins responsible for a few hundred RedHat, Solaris, and (thankfully very few) Windows Servers in an ASP environment.

I am a RedHat Certified Engineer (<nowiki>[[http://www.redhat.com/training/certification/verify/?rhce_cert_display:certno=804006625922204&rhce_cert_display:verify_cb=Verify|#804006625922204]]</nowiki>).

Having gotten started with Linux in the days when Hardware Support was still quite immature, I have quite a bit of experience configuring and compiling the Kernel and troubleshooting Kernel Module issues.  This certainly came in quite handy in a previous job integrating hardware in an <nowiki>[[https://www.navo.navy.mil/auv/auv_vehicles.html|embedded, real-time system]]</nowiki>.

=== Contributions ===

None yet, though I expect to change that very soon.
