=== Notice ===

This information is most likely out of date. I may update it in the future, but see some of the resources on the right for more accurate information.

=== Me ===

I'm Jacob Peddicord, an 18-year-old web and software developer, Ubuntu member, and CSE student. 

I know Python, PHP/MySQL, C/C++, and HTML/CSS/JavaScript technologies, to name a few.
Most of my web applications are written in Python with the <nowiki>[[http://djangoproject.com|Django web framework]]</nowiki>.

I started venturing into Linux back in late 2005. I had downloaded Ubuntu 5.10 because I had always heard many great things about it. However, it refused to install from a DVD drive, and as a result, I tried SuSE. In May 2006, when Dapper was starting to become popular, I installed it and since then have never went back to any other distribution. I have given out around 50 copies of Ubuntu since (over 1000 if you count Ohio LinuxFest!), and have personally installed around 20 copies on others' machines.
