=== Problem Statement ===

The Ubuntu community desires to create a high quality Linux Distribution which appeals to a wide variety of user lifestyles and personal preferences. To aide in meeting this objective a selection of alternate wallpapers is shipped by default which is readily available through the "Appearance Preferences" dialog.

=== Goal(s) ===

The goal is to solicit graphic designs in the form of illustrations to be used as wallpapers from the community at large targeted to defined roles and market segments. 

=== Assumptions ===

** The Unity desktop, classic desktop, and humanity icon themes will be used
** The collection of classic desktop themes may include themes which are generally described as light and themes which are generally described as dark

=== Design Considerations ===

Regardless of the role, the desired result of the successful submission will __render feelings__ which may be described as light and bright.
