__TOC__

Ubuntu user since December 2006.  I live in Seattle and travel to many developing countries.  

My experience with UBUNTU 

* Using Open Office for regular documents to share with Microsoft users - only works if I create the first version.  This creates problems.  
* Installing new memory and an wifi card on a really old Dell - works, but wifi won't automatically re-acquire - painfully slow process, but probably due to really old wifi card.  I am pretty sure this old Dell would run MUCH slower on M$FT.  
* Ruby on Rails on Ubuntu - still difficult 
* Geronimo installation and configuration - stuck 
* Eclipse installation and configuration - difficult but doable 
* Unhappy with: Zim Desktop Wiki seems to cause system freeze on an irregular basis 
* Happy with: Upgrade path from Drapper Drake to Feisty Fawn - successful 
* Overall Ubuntu experience - good 

I travel to a variety of countries and promote Ubuntu whenever I get the chance in meetings with entrepreneurs and technologists.
