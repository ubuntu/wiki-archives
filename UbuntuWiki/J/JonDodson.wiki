=== Computing History in all its Glory (or lack thereof) ===
  
* Started computing on a <nowiki>[[http://oldcomputers.net/vic20.html|VIC 20]]</nowiki> my parents bought. It rocked. I played games, and started hacking with code I found in commodore magazines. Thus begineth my computing career.
* Moved to a Tandy computer. DOS enters picture. DOS was not a terrible OS.
* Took an Apple Basic class in Junior High. Thus begain my more serious programming days. GWBasic was the language I used to hack on some cheesy text based games.
* Then my parents ponied up some major cash for a 486SX/25! What a SWEET Machine! We could play mpeg video and it came with a soundcard! Win3.1 sucked though, I liked DOS better. QBasic was my language of choice.
* **Will finish at a later date.**
* Graduated George Fox University with my degree in Computer Information Science.
* Interned at <nowiki>[[http://www.mentor.com|Mentor Graphics]]</nowiki>.
* Had a brief stint working for the Xerox Corporation.
