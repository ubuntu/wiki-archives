Hi, I'm a big-time Ubuntu fan, definitely an "early adopter", always using pre-release versions since I got hooked on Jaunty. This time 'round, I've been on Lucid since Alpha 1, I've tested Xubuntu and Lubuntu, I've submitted bugs, I am hoping to help edit the Ubuntu Manual Project. I really want to help Ubuntu be the best product it can be. I have 10 years of software development background, but I've been "home dad" since 2001 and no longer see myself as a developer. But I've just recently accepted a new position as a software tester. My focus on quality and detail will be an asset on the Bug Squad.

My hardware is an Acer Aspire One, it originally came with a solid-state disk, which was horrible, so I pulled it out and I now have 2 external USB drives that I can test on to my heart's content, so I also have a fairly unique h/w setup.

Update 2010-08-29: Went to Ubuntu Global Jam yesterday in Kitchener, Ontario, Canada. Met txwikinger and triaged a couple bugs. Remain active and committed to Ubuntu.

I live near Toronto, Canada in the Eastern time zone (GMT-5).
