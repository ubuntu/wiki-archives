Although this is lame as far as home pages go, I'll make it good soon! 

About me, I'm and Environmental enginnering/Sociology student in Sydney. It's a bit of a random combination. 

At the moment my main interest in computing at the moment is modeling and scientific computing, and I'm doing an final year thesis on the Godunov numerical scheme for open channel water flow. I've also been involved in automated data collection and analysis system (one of the few aspects of computing that involves ditch digging)!
