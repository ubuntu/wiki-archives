== Introduction ==
Jaunty Jackalope will soon become Kubuntu 9.04!

The focus of 9.04 for the Kubuntu community is delivering a polished, user-friendly KDE 4.2-based desktop. We will continue migrating much of our existing Kubuntu software to KDE 4. Jaunty is the first dazzling step into the future of desktops with innovation not seen elsewhere.

Alpha 5, the fifth in a series of testing CD images that will be released throughout this cycle, represents the very latest snapshot of Jaunty Jackalope. The pre-release images are known to be reasonably free of major undocumented CD-build or installer bugs; however, they are not recommended for use in stable environments. These releases will be for those who are developing, documenting, and testing. The Alpha 5 release can be downloaded from the following URL:

* http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/releases/jaunty/alpha-5/

'''NOTE:''' ''This is an alpha (pre-) release. Pre-release versions of Jaunty are '''__NOT__''' encouraged for anyone needing a stable system or for anyone not comfortable running into occasional, even frequent, breakage. Pre-release versions of Jaunty '''__ARE__''' recommended for Kubuntu developers and those who want to help in testing, reporting, and fixing bugs. Please do not use this in a production environment with data or workflows that you cannot do without.''

== New or Improved In Alpha 5 ==

In short, everything!!

The Jaunty Jackalope Alpha 5 CD release includes a brand new desktop as well as many fixes and new applications. For this release, we are exploring some desktop additions and updates to many common applications as well as bug fixes to some annoyances you may have encountered. With every new pre-release, updates are documented, allowing you to thoroughly test your Kubuntu installation. Remember that all of these features are part of a pre-release version of Kubuntu and may still have issues. We ask that you, for any problems you come across, file a bug if one has yet to be filed for your problem.<<BR>>

=== Qt 4.5 RC1 ===

Jaunty Jackalope Alpha 5 ships with latest Qt. Qt Software, formerly known as Trolltech, published the first release candidate of version 4.5 and the final version is scheduled to be available in the first quarter of 2009. Qt 4.5 is licensed under LGPL beneath GPL which will guarantee growing interests of commercial developers. Qt 4.5 brings a faster overall desktop experience, though as it is still very new it has not been extensively tested. You can help by finding new rough edges and bugs that occur with Qt 4.5.

=== KDE 4.2 ===
{{http://kde.org/announcements/4.2/screenshots/desktop_thumb.png}}

KDE has recently released version 4.2.0 of their amazing desktop environment. There are many changes including bug fixes, new functionality, and more. Some of these changes include, but are not limited to:
* Significant refinements of Plasma and KWin, the KDE workspace
* Many improvements:
*** Compositing desktop effects
*** Improved plasma widgets
*** New desktop effects
*** The return of the optional "Classic Desktop" motif
*** More configuration options
For complete details of the KDE 4.2 release, please consult http://kde.org/announcements/4.2/ .

The Kubuntu team continues the evolutionary process of refining and enhancing the KDE 4.2.0 packaging.  New in Alpha 5 are Python bindings for <nowiki>[[http://edu.kde.org/marble/|Marble]]</nowiki>, KDE Educational's desktop globe.

=== Ubiquity ===
<nowiki>[[File:ubiquity-alpha5-resized.png]]</nowiki>

The installer got massive improvements. Among various miscellaneous changes is an improved timezone map and the  frontend was ported to PyKDE4, giving us a better KDE4 look and feel.

=== Quassel ===

<nowiki>[[File:quassel40.png]]</nowiki>

<nowiki>[[http://quassel-irc.org/|Quassel]]</nowiki> is a new IRC client that is now the default for Kubuntu Jaunty. For Alpha 5, it has been updated to version 0.4.  It is feature-complete, but It still needs testing so that we can identify bugs and get them fixed.

While Quassel is a split client-core application, in Kubuntu the standalone version is installed.  A quick How-to can be found <nowiki>[[http://jakeandgus.blogspot.com/2009/01/quick-quassel-standalone-how-to.html|here]]</nowiki>, but version 0.4 now has a setup wizard which makes it pretty easy to get going.

=== KMail/Akonadi/Amarok2 ===
An issue preventing the coexistence of Amarok2 and Kmail/Akonadi has been addressed, so now both can be installed together.

Amarok 1.4 is no longer available. Amarok 2 is available from the Universe repository but is not installed by default. It will be present in the final Jaunty release, so please install it, test it, and alert the Kubuntu developers to regressions by filing bug reports.

=== New KDE 4 Network-Manager Plasma Widget ===
<nowiki>[[File:plasmoid-network-manager2.jpg]]</nowiki>

Alpha 5 contains a new plasma-widget-network-manager for testing. The older knetworkmanager panel applet is still available but no longer starts automatically. Please file bugs against this new plasma widget if you encounter regressions from the older knetworkmanager applet.

=== Kdebluetooth ===
Kdebluetooth has been updated and is back in Alpha 5 but needs work and lots of testing as well. Please give it a try and help out by filing bug reports.

=== choqoK ===
<nowiki>[[File:choqoK1.jpg]]</nowiki>

Micro blogging is very popular in the FOSS world. ChoqoK, a client for KDE, was releases in version 0.4 and is now available for Jaunty. It now has  support for direct messages and of course for identi.ca.

== Kubuntu Documentation ==
We have reintroduced Kubuntu Documentation in the hopes that people use KHelpCenter. We need volunteers to help update the information from KDE 3- to KDE 4-based applications.

If you are interested in helping out, please contact:
* <nowiki>[[RichardJohnson|Richard Johnson]]</nowiki>

== Known Issues ==
* The network manager plasmoid does not show by default.  You can add it to plasma through the Plasma button in the bottom right.  For the old knetworkmanager applet, use Alt-F2 and type "knetworkmanager".
* Due to a software regression in the latest upload of the network manager plasmoid, wireless connections may not work for you. An update following the Alpha 5 release will resolve this issue.
* Kmail sieve functionality is buggy and causes CPU hang. You shouldn't use it at the moment.

== Feedback ==
We want to hear what you think about the current Alpha 5 release of Kubuntu 9.04, the Jaunty Jackalope. We want to know if it Rocks, if it is just OK, or if it is flat out wrong. No matter the feedback, as long as it is in line with the <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/community/conduct|Ubuntu Code of Conduct]]</nowiki>, we would like to hear it.

So what are you waiting for? Head on over to the <nowiki>[[JauntyJackalope-Alpha5-Kubuntu-Feedback|Feedback Page]]</nowiki> and let us know!
