=== Contributions ===

I'm working with Ubuntu since Dapper came out.

I contribute to Ubuntu by doing some bugfixes and reports for Ubuntu and Debian.
Since some months i'm also doing some merges and syncs to get newer versions in Ubuntu.

=== Future Goals ===

I would like to become more active in MOTU. And eventually being able to sponsor myself.
It is just cool to be able to improve your OS you use every day
