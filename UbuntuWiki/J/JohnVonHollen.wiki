=== About Me ===

I am a recent graduate (August 2007) from the University of Georgia with a major in Management Information Systems (MIS). While living in Athens I was an active member of Classic Hackers UGA Linux User Group (CHUGALUG), and a member of the Primary Staff at <nowiki>[[http://freeitathens.org/|Free IT Athens]]</nowiki>. I now live in Atlanta and work as a Technology Risk Consultant with <nowiki>[[http://www.protivit.com|Protiviti]]</nowiki>.

I have been using Ubuntu since June of 2006. I may not be an expert on Linux, but computers have always been one of my hobbies. I think Ubuntu is a great all around operating system that anyone can use.

=== Georgia LoCo ===

I am the founder and a Council Member of the <nowiki>[[GeorgiaUSTeam]]</nowiki>.
