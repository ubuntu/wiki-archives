__TOC__

I am very simple but very complicated as well.  I love Ubuntu and have been using it since the very beginning.  I feel its the best desktop there is just at first glance.  I love the Android Market which came from Linux and lead me to get a job selling Phones at Verizon.  So you can say that I am already in the Linux Market.  There are some things I am very interested in a couple being that Mark Shuttleworth wants to move forward and get into the tablet and CellPhone market this is very exciting and a dream come true.  I have been waiting for the Ubuntu phone for years and now it will come into the very lame market just to make it more fun.  I would love to be part of the phone and tablet development.
