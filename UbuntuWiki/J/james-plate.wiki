=== About Me ===
{{https://launchpadlibrarian.net/97034582/_thumb.me.jpg}}
I've been a long term Linux "hobbiest" having started experimenting with Linux distros (primarily Debian) quite a few years ago. However, the past couple of years I had been using a dual boot setup with Ubuntu and Windows. Since I found myself rarely needing to boot into Windows(really only to use my printer that has NO support in Linux), I finally switched completely to Ubuntu.

I currently find myself with far too much time on my hands due to health issues, and as such, have opted to devote some time towards helping within Ubuntu where I am able. I always enjoy helping others and learning news things along the way.

=== Team Memberships ===
{*} <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~bugsquad|Ubuntu Bug Squad]]</nowiki>
{*} <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-ca|Ubuntu Canada]]</nowiki>
{*} <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-testing |Ubuntu Testing]]</nowiki>
{*} <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-doc | Ubuntu Documentation Team ]]</nowiki>

=== Future Plans & Projects ===
For the time being, simply learning and contributing all that I can.

=== Contributions to the Ubuntu Community ===
Currently, encouraging friends and family to to open up to the idea Free Software and converting those I can to use or try Ubuntu and it's derivatives.

I have been spending time in #ubuntu offering assistance when I am able. My current situation leaves me with plenty of time on my hands, so I am frequently online at varying times anywhere from 05:00 to 00:00 UTC.

As well, I have made some VERY minor patches for the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-doc | Ubuntu Documentation Team]]</nowiki> to get a feel for the process and work towards getting involved more in-depth. I have also been slowly working on getting more involved with the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~bugsquad|Ubuntu Bug Squad]]</nowiki>.
