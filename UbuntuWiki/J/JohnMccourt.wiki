__TOC__

I mainly like programming in PHP/MYSQL and Gambas but I know a few tother languages too. My contribution to Linux normally involes bug reporting and Linux promotion but I have also written a program in Gambas that allows people to watch online TV on their Linux desktop. That program is called STV Linux and is available at http://steeky.com/stvlinux
