| Hi, I'm the Lead of UbuntuKylin, a Chinese flavor of Ubuntu. I'm also the vice director of the desktop OS lab in National University of Defense Technology (NUDT), China. I have become a Linux lover since I wrote my first USB driver at my undergraduate course at 2003. I studied one year in National University of Singapore during 2008-2009 and graduated with my PhD thesis "Research on Measurement and Security of P2P Networks" at 2010. After that, I devoted myself into the Ubuntu world.

Jack has made a lot of good contributions to Ubuntu/UbuntuKylin and local open-source community.

We also co-organized the Ubuntu/UbuntuKylin 13.04 release party in Beijing. He also shows great leadership in the UbuntuKylin project. All in all, he has really contributed a lot, makes him a suitable candidate for Ubuntu Membership.

It is an honour to work with Jack so that UbuntuKylin can be on track. He tries to learn a lot, and he's gaining quite a bit of experience. He is fully dedicated to his work on making Ubuntu available for all Chinese users. I sincerely promote him for Ubuntu Membership. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:smartboyhw]]</nowiki> 
I have been working closely with Jack Yu on UbuntuKylin project for nearly two months, and we had cooperated on the project much longer before that. He is very enthusiastic on pushing the project forward and have been doing a great job, and he is eager to make Ubuntu and open source software more usable for Chinese people. UbuntuKylin project is a recognized flavor of Ubuntu focuses on localized experience for China. Not liking other flavors that prompts certain technique (e.g. Kubuntu for KDE), it's basic goal is enhancing Ubuntu's experience for Chinese users. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:happyaron]]</nowiki> 
I've been doing some reviews/sponsoring for Jack this year, he's motivated and has been doing good work. Having him as an Ubuntu members makes sense, +1 from me there -- seb128
