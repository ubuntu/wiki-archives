Greetings All,

One of my interests entering 2007 is to spend lots more time on Ubuntu at home. The other is talking about the transition. Our laptop is currently dual booting XP pro and Edgy on a Toshiba Satellite A60 - flawlessly. Grub still defaults to XP but with a little coaxing the wifey, I hope to set the grub default to Edgy. With my first install of Ubuntu Edgy, theres nothing I do on XP that I can't do on Ubuntu. Well, maybe except my iTunes video re-runs of SG:Atlantis. All in good time, though.

As always, this dude is all about commercialization of space. Can't happen fast enough for me.
Best Regards,
Jeff.
