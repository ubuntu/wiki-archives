=== About Me ===

I'm a 20 year old student studying a Computer Science Degree at the <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_of_west_anglia|College of West Anglia]]</nowiki> in the <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK|UK]]</nowiki>. I have a keen interest in computer programming and aim to become a programmer/software developer once I have completed my degree.

Ubuntu 7.04 was the first flavour of Linux I had used and have been using Ubuntu on the desktop since 2004, running a mix of Ubuntu desktops, laptops and servers at home.

I installed Ubuntu when version 7.04 (<nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FeistyFawn|Feisty Fawn]]</nowiki>) was released and am now running 11.10 (<nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/OneiricOcelot]]</nowiki>).

=== External Stuff ===

* Hand out Ubuntu CDs to friends etc.

=== Future Work ===

* I'd like to continue providing good translations for Ubuntu.
* Report discovered bugs in timely fashion.
* Learn more about how Ubuntu works as an OS.
* Learn to contribute code to Ubuntu bug fixes.
* Be able to create complex programs for Ubuntu and other Linux based distros. Currently, I am a fairly capable programmer in the following languages: VB.Net, C#, C++, Java and VB6 (including HTML for the web). I would like to move away from somewhat Microsoft restricted languages and improve my knowledge in Java, C++ and to learn Python.
