__TOC__

I am Jay Sulzberger.

I will speak at 3:00 pm Friday 16 February 2007
in the old PORT OF AUTHORITY weapons building at 111 Eighth Avenue in Manhattan.  The weapons building occupies the entire block between 15th and 16th Streets, and Eighth and Ninth Avenues.  There are 42 entrances, and it is known that there are at least thirteen exits.  This count includes all exits reliably reported to have been successfully used by human beings after 1942.  This count does not include other exits.

The present correlation of forces in the struggle between
the Englobulators and the people of Earth is not widely
understood, despite the long continued efforts of thousands
of Slashdot authors.

I will argue for action now.
