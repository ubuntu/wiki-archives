=== About Me ===
Hello!  I work as a tester for Big Blue in NZ by day.  In my spare time I like poking around with Python and I just joined the BugSquad and Ubutu-bugs mailing list.  Relative newbie to Ubuntu and Linux in general, so no preferred areas of specialization at this point.  Just figured that looking at bugs is usually the best place to start if you want to learn how a system hangs together (at least that's how I normally end up learning things).

=== Future Goals ===
* Get to grips with how BugSquad operates and triage some bugs.
* Have a peek at the BugHelper code - the idea behind this app is pure genius.  Sure it seems obvious once you have read the description, one of those 'Why didn't I think of that?' type of tools.
* Contribute to something that strikes my fancy.
