I was involved in Ubuntu as an early employee of Canonical, from before the launch of Ubuntu 4.10 (Warty Warthog) until just after Ubuntu 6.06 LTS (Dapper Drake). Through that period I was involved in business and community development, evangelism and smatterings of technical stuff here and there. :-)

I would like to renew my lapsed membership (after four years!) as I'd like to contribute in a some small way again. While this may involve a bit of packaging in the future, for now I will focus on a new Act of Niche Journalism, ''<nowiki>[[http://ubuntuedge.wordpress.com/|Ubuntu’s Bleeding Edge]]</nowiki>'', a blog about activity in the development branch. I have also offered to help with the <nowiki>[[Website]]</nowiki>, in particular bringing PlanetUbuntu up to date (both software and theme).

=== Testimonials ===

* Awesome to see Jeff coming back to Ubuntu!  He was one of the original gang
* Jeff was one of the original community-focused members of Ubuntu, many of us can directly trace our involvement back to him so it's good to see him return by starting up a new development-focused blog. Things are probably a bit different from the old days, councils, governance, work items and whatnot, so I recommend reviewing the teams, etc. in the areas you plan to work on. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:jorge]]</nowiki>  * Jeff put a lot of hard work into Ubuntu and its community in the early days. A lot of initiatives came up during that time. For example did he fly around the world giving heaps of talks, he took care of artwork in Ubuntu, there was JDUB TV, and the thing I loved most was the install-ubuntu-server-with-your-toe blog post. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:dholbach]]</nowiki>  * Jeff was instrumental in laying the groundwork for Ubuntu to become what it is today. He brought tremendous energy and good ideas to the table, and it would be great to see him participating actively again. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:mdz]]</nowiki>
