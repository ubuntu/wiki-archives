Hello All,

I am interested in Ubuntu GNOME testing. I love using this derivative and I want to make it the best that it can be. The only thing that I miss is the traditional GNOME 2 interface. I have worked around this by installing MATE 1.6 on my production machine running Ubuntu GNOME 13.10.

I have two computers that I can dedicate to Ubuntu GNOME testing. One is a HP Touch Smart fx2-1025dx Notebook PC and the other is a dual hard drive HP Pavilion Elite HPE desktop with an Nvidia graphics card. I recently gave away my HP desktop with an ATI graphics card - now I wish I hadn't because of the problems people are experiencing with these cards.
