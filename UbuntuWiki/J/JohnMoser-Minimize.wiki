=== Summary ===
This is an experimental spec to create a minimalistic Ubuntu proper.

=== Rationale ===
A lot of extra cruft goes into Ubuntu proper, including vim, tcpdump, telnet, and ed.  Most users won't use these; and any scripts or programs requiring them should depend on them.

=== Use cases ===
All uses of Ubuntu will benefit from a smaller install base.

* A typical Ubuntu install will not contain all the excess tools, and thus will be smaller.
* A "power user" can install an ubuntu-poweruser or ubuntu-cli-tools package to restore original behavior.

=== Scope ===
The scope of this spec excludes the following:

* Any applications visible to the user through the menu
* Any applications supplying a function of a visible application (i.e. bzip2 and tar let file-roller open .tar.bz2 files)
* POSIX tools

=== Design ===
The following packages are proposed removed from the seed and relegated to ubuntu-powerusers:

* '''aptitude''' ''7.3M'':  Who uses this?  We have synaptic and apt, only power users use this!
* '''apt-utils''' ''483K'':  More power user toys for apt.
* '''dc''' ''205K'':  POSIX specifies ''bc'', we should only install ''dc'' if a .deb depends on it.
* '''dnsutils''' ''360K'':  More power user stuff
* '''dselect''' ''1.8M'':  Many users find dselect intimidating and why do we even have this?  If something wants it it can depend on it.
* '''ltrace''' ''201K'':  Debugging tool.
* '''nano''' ''1.4M'':  nano-tiny uses 238K.
* '''netcat''' ''233K'': I'm pretty sure this isn't necessary.
* '''screen''' ''999K'': Power user tool!  (We love it but..)
* '''slocate''' ''156K'':  More command line tools nobody is going to use unless they're a power user (and I still use pure find)
* '''strace''' ''250K'':  Debugging tool, like ''ltrace''.
* '''tcpdump''' ''655K'':  Another toy like ''netcat''.
* '''time''' ''147K'':  Useful for people testing out optimization hacks on code et al.  Not useful on the desktop.
* '''vim''' ''1.4M'':  I love it.  It's too big, no normal user uses it.  Replace with ''nvi'' (631K) for ''visudo''.
* '''vim-common''' ''582K'':  With ''vim''.
* '''vim-runtime''' ''22M'':  With ''vim''.
* '''w3m''' ''1.8M'':  A text-based browser.  Ubuntu ships with ''firefox''.

'''Total''':  ''39.9M''

Partials that need splitting:

* '''bsdutils''' ''168K'':  Need to keep ''renice'' (POSIX) and ''logger'' (POSIX)
* '''findutils''' ''1.3M'':  Need to keep ''find'' (POSIX) and ''xargs'' (POSIX); locate and updatedb are from slocate and we can leave it at that.

'''Total''':  ~''1.5M''

And uncertainties:

* '''ftp''' ''156K'':  Not needed for POSIX, but what may it be for?  I'm not sure if ''nautilus'' uses this (it uses ssh for ssh shares so I could see ''ftp'' use for ftp...).
* '''info''' ''332K'':  Is this even really used?  Most apps don't HAVE an info page.
* '''lftp''' ''1.5M'':  Same question as with ''ftp''; but this does a lot more so it's a bigger question.
* '''lsof''' ''369K'':  Anything use this?
* '''mawk''' ''229K'':  Can we pick ONE of this and ''gawk''?
* '''gawk''' ''1.9M'':  Can we pick ONE of this and ''mawk''?
* '''mtr-tiny''' ''102K'':  Do we need this?
* '''rsync''' ''483K'':  Useful, but do we use it?
* '''telnet''' ''184K'':  Uh... what is this used for?

'''Total''':  ''5.2M''

Things we omitted and want to justify keeping:

* '''cpio''' ''528K'':  initramfs generation needs this.
* '''dash''' ''209K'':  Seriously?  This should be root's shell, we might totally trash the system and need it.

As well, python should have been relegated to a meta-package like ubuntu-developer-python.  It seems it's been removed from ubuntu-desktop but not relegated to a new package.  Some packages still around include:

* '''diveintopython''' ''4.3M'':  A book.  Nobody's reading this unless they're not a python programmer, and thus are mostly likely to NOT CARE.  If they want to start, then it's there.

Together our certain packages and diveintopython total ''44.2M''.  This should all be packaged on the CD, but omitted from the install base.

=== Implementation ===

==== Code ====

==== Data preservation and migration ====

=== Outstanding issues ===
* 44 megs isn't a lot.  We need to eliminate much more to actually gain anything.
* OpenOffice.org takes over 200MB!  We must wait it out and hope it shrinks, unfortunately.

=== BoF agenda and discussion ===
