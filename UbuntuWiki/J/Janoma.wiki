My name is Alejandro and I live in Chile. For more info about myself, and for research info see my <nowiki>[[http://db.ing.puc.cl/amallea/|homepage]]</nowiki>.

=== A story that begins years ago ===
Despite having used Linux since the days of RedHat 7.3, I made the final switch only at the end of 2006. I've tried at least once RedHat, SuSE, Slackware, Debian, Mandrake, Freespire and a couple of Debian variants whose name I can't remember.

=== Me, myself and I ===
I should have been a Mathematician by now, but life proved to be harsh and I couldn't finish my degree. I started studying again, and I'm quite happy with my decision. If you want to read some stupid things I've written in the past, visit my <nowiki>[[http://janoma.cl/|blog]]</nowiki>.

'''Update (dec. 2008):''' I started it again, and I'm quite motivated and happy for it.

'''Update (oct. 2009):''' I'm still happy for it!

'''Update (apr. 2011):''' Wow, I found this wiki, which was quite forgotten.
