Call me "Rin", "Joey", or "Joŝko".

=== About Me ===

<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/PicIRC.png]]</nowiki> My name is Joey Stanford and I'm a <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/community/processes/newmember|full Ubuntu member]]</nowiki>. I made the switch to using only Ubuntu in my personal life in 2004.  I have been using GNU/Linux since the mid-1990s. I currently work for <nowiki>[[http://canonical.com|Canonical LTD]]</nowiki>.

<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/IconHandshake.png]]</nowiki>  I was a <nowiki>[[http://openoffice.org|OpenOffice.org]]</nowiki> project lead and founder of the l10n and Native Lang <nowiki>[[http://eo.openoffice.org|Esperanto Teams]]</nowiki>.  {{http://eo.openoffice.org/ooo_get_legal_eo.png}} I currently work with other F/OSS projects like <nowiki>[[http://bazaar-vcs.org/JoeyStanford|bzr]]</nowiki>.

<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/IconFavourites.png]]</nowiki> I'm very passionate about the Free/Open Source software movements and am a strong believer in using such software as the foundation of all computing. (<nowiki>[[MarkShuttleworth|Mark]]</nowiki> said this best: ''We’re committed to reinventing everything we need until the free software stack is a genuinely complete computing universe.'') I am also a big advocate (and part-time activist) for GNU/Linux on the desktop and as such am a strong supporter of my favourite distribution, Ubuntu.
