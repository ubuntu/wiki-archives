=== CaliforniaLeadership ===

County: Alameda

I have been involved in the California team since mid-2009 and have contributed to several projects/joint-projects with the California team. See the above section.  

I was the founder of the Berkeley Linux User Group <nowiki>[[http://www.berkeleylug.com|BerkeleyLUG]]</nowiki> - currently one of the most active LUGs in the Bay Area.  I believe my experience leading this group will directly help me be an effective California team council-member.
