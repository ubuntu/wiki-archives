4.b   Variation: There are more running entries than can fit on the screen<<BR>>
        .1    User presses Tab↓↑ until the indication has moved at half-way down the screen.<<BR>>
        .2    User presses Tab↓↑.<<BR>>
        .3    Launcher scrolls up one position to put the next entry under the indication (rather than continuing to move the indication down).<<BR>>
        .4    User continues to press Tab↓↑, causing the Launcher to scroll up one position until...<<BR>>
        .5    Launcher scrolls up enough that the final running entry is brought on screen.<<BR>>

'''Depends on:''' The Launcher contains an entry that is not currently focused<<BR>>

 '''Steps'''

1.    The User presses Super↓N↓↑↑, where N is a single digit corresponding to an entry in the Nth position of the Launcher. For example, the User presses Super↓1↓↑↑ to focus the first entry in the Launcher,  Super↓2↓↑↑ for the second entry, etc.  Super↓0↓↑↑ corresponds to the tenth entry.<<BR>>
2.    The corresponding entry becomes focused.<<BR>>
3.    The corresponding application is focused.<<BR>>
    USE CASE ENDS<<BR>>

==== Adding an entry by dragging an item from Applications place ====

'''Name:''' Adding an entry by dragging an item from Applications place<<BR>>

'''Case ID:''' unilau-011<<BR>>
'''Depends on:''' None<<BR>>

 '''Steps'''

1.    The User drags an Application item from the Applications place into the drag safe zone.<<BR>>
2.    The Launcher unfolds based on the vertical position of the cursor.<<BR>>
3.    A line is drawn between the closest two entries to the cursor position to indicate where the entry will be placed.<<BR>>
4.    The drag continues over the Launcher.<<BR>>
5.    All icons whose centers fall below the cursor position on the vertical axis slide down one position to make room for the icon being dragged. If the item is dragged below the bottommost application entry, an empty position is drawn before Places.<<BR>>
6.    While the user is still moving the cursor to position the icon, resident icons should continue to slide upward or downward to leave an empty position near the cursor.<<BR>>
7.    Once the user decides where to place the icon, the user drops the icon over the Launcher and the empty position revealed by the resident icons is occupied by the icon dropped.<<BR>>
    USE CASE ENDS<<BR>>
3.a   Variation: The item dragged cannot be added<<BR>>
        .1    When the item being dragged cannot be added--for example, if it is a not an Application item but rather a reference to an application available in the Software Center--no line is drawn between entries and the resident entries should not slide to create an empty slot.<<BR>>
        .2    The user will get the impression that the item cannot be placed in the Launcher, as no empty position is available, so the user will discontinue the drag.<<BR>>
        USE CASE ENDS<<BR>>
4.b   Variation: The user drags the icon out of the drag safe zone without dropping it<<BR>>
        .1    When the cursor is moved out of the drag safe zone, the Launcher returns to its normal state; any icons that have moved out of place to make room for the new icon return to their starting positions.<<BR>>
        .2    At this point, the user may discontinue the drag by dropping the item, or may drag the item back into the drag safe zone to reopen the empty position.<<BR>>
        USE CASE ENDS<<BR>>
7.a   Variation: The item dragged is already present in the Launcher<<BR>>
        .1    The icon moved slides from its old position to its new position. This move should be animated so the user understands what has happened, rather than believing that the Launcher has spontaneously changed icon order.<<BR>>
        .2   Icons below the old position slide upward one position.<<BR>>

 '''Verification'''
    An entry is added to the Launcher where the item is dropped
----
==== Removing an entry from the Launcher ====

2.    The User chooses the QuickList menu entry labeled "Remove from Launcher".<<BR>>
3.    The removed entry disappears from the Launcher.<<BR>>
4.    Any entries below the empty Launcher position slide upward to fill the empty position.<<BR>>
    USE CASE ENDS<<BR>>
1.a   Variation: The User drags the entry off the Launcher<<BR>>
        .1    The User drags the entry horizontally to the right to release it from the Launcher.<<BR>>
        .2    The Launcher now behaves exactly as when dragging an application to add it to the Launcher (2.11).<<BR>>
        .3    If the drag leaves the drag safe zone, a minus symbol is affixed to the cursor.<<BR>>
        .4    The User drops the entry, causing the dragged representation of the entry to disappear.<<BR>>
        RETURN TO 4<<BR>>
1.b   Variation: Entry is removed by the system (rather than by the User)<<BR>>
        .1    When an application corresponding to an unpinned entry is removed (e.g. using apt, synaptic, Software Center, etc.), its entry quietly fades from the Launcher.<<BR>>
        RETURN TO 4<<BR>>
2.a   Variation: The corresponding application is still running<<BR>>
        .1    The "Remove from Launcher" menu entry is instead a checkbox menu entry labeled "Keep in Launcher" in a checked state.<<BR>>
        .2    The User clicks the menu entry to remove the check.<<BR>>

 '''Verification'''
    The entry is removed from the Launcher

2.    An entry for GVim appears is added in the empty position.<<BR>>
3.    The GVim entry receives focus.<<BR>>
    USE CASE ENDS<<BR>>
1.b   Variation: Adding GVim makes it so there are more entries than can fit on the screen<<BR>>

 '''Verification'''
    The entry for GVim is focused (and present) in the Launcher

        .3    No DropList entry is activated (no drop action is performed).<<BR>>
        .4    The DropList closes and windows return to their previous (unspread) positions.<<BR>>
        USE CASE ENDS<<BR>>
5.a    Variation: The drop occurs in negative space<<BR>>
        .1    Dropping in negative space (i.e. the space not occupied by individual spread windows, the DropList, the Launcher, or the Places Bar) discontinues the drag (i.e. hides the DropList, unspreads windows).<<BR>>
