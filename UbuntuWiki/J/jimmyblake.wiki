===== Work =====
I am the Chief Security Officer for <nowiki>[[http://www.mimecast.com|Mimecast]]</nowiki>, a UK-based Software-as-a-Service business specialising in email and unstructured data management.  We're extensive users of Linux, which is used to power much of our bespoke grid platform.

I have a background in Information Security and Business Continuity Planning, but I also have experience in product management and product marketing.
===== Linux =====
I've been a user of Linux since running Slackware during my first university course in the early nineties (22 3.5" floppies, if I remember correctly) and Ubuntu is now my main distro.  I am a member of the <nowiki>[[http://kentlug.org|Kent Linux User Group]]</nowiki>, but due to conflicting priorities I don't get to attend as many of the meet-ups as I'd like.
===== Interests =====
Outside of open source, my interests include role playing games (both tabletop and online), Harley-Davidson motorcycles, tattoo art, body modification, heavy metal music and good ale.
