__TOC__

Late 30's self taught computer geek. 

Would love to do more as a career, but as yet.. I am just everyones "computer guy"

Using Ubuntu on PPC platform. May also install on PC.

I have been using linux distro's since the original Slakware and Debian days, but I am really a desktop user and have not found any that I like enough to convert to full time.
