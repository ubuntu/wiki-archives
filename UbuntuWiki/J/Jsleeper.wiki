Started really getting into Linux in 2001 when I had my first Network Administrator job and we used MS Proxy 2.0.  I noticed that I couldn't really modify it, that's when a sysadmin at another site within the company introduced me to Squid.  It's all uphill from there.

Maybe if I get more involved more will be here, I just didn't want a blank page from the launchpad account  :).
