Saw that the page with my name was available and decided to stick my email address on here. ;)

As i learn more advanced/cool things about <nowiki>[[Ubuntu]]</nowiki> (and Linux in general) i will put a Howto and some info on here or add to the UserDocumentation if it's not already well documented. If you have something you'd like to add then feel free to do so.
