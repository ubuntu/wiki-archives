==== Projects ====
===== Mobile Internet =====
The goal is to connect to the Internet through Nokia N95 with IBM ThinkPad T41 & BlueTooth.
The Nokia N95, a.k.a N95-1 supports infrared, bluetooth and USB cable connections. Now to figure out how to make this device provide access to the 2G, 3G and 3.5G cellular network data services of up to 7.2 mbit down and some 300 kbps up.

With the release of 8.10 this project is scrapped.

===== Nokia N95 Sync =====
The goal is to in some way sync the Nokia N95-1 device with some PIM, like evolution, kmail or Thunderbird/Lightning. The Nokia N95 device supports SyncML. Sync of contacts and calendar would be nice.
