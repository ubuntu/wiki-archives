__TOC__

I'm a developer looking to make a contribution to the community.

My experience is mainly with C, C++, C#, VB, PHP, SQL. But I've also done some java and am interested adding to my very basic knowledge of Python.

I'm based in the UK and usually available later on in the evenings and sometimes at weekends.
