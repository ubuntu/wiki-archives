== Introduction ==
Jaunty Jackalope will soon become Kubuntu 9.04!

The focus of 9.04 for the Kubuntu community is delivering a polished, user-friendly KDE 4.2-based desktop. Jaunty is the first dazzling step into the future of desktops with innovation not seen elsewhere.

Alpha 6, the sixth in a series of testing CD images that will be released throughout this cycle, represents the very latest snapshot of Jaunty Jackalope. The pre-release images are known to be reasonably free of major undocumented CD-build or installer bugs; however, they are not recommended for use in stable environments. These releases will be for those who are developing, documenting, and testing. The Alpha 6 release can be downloaded from the following URL:

* http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/releases/jaunty/alpha-6/

'''NOTE:''' ''This is an alpha (pre-) release. Pre-release versions of Jaunty are '''__NOT__''' encouraged for anyone needing a stable system or for anyone not comfortable running into occasional, even frequent, breakage. Pre-release versions of Jaunty '''__ARE__''' recommended for Kubuntu developers and those who want to help in testing, reporting, and fixing bugs. Please do not use this in a production environment with data or workflows that you cannot do without.''

== New or Improved In Alpha 6 ==

The Jaunty Jackalope Alpha 6 CD release includes a brand new desktop as well as many fixes and new applications. For this release, we are exploring some desktop additions and updates to many common applications as well as bug fixes to some annoyances you may have encountered. We are also progressing with our migration of KDE3 applications and dependencies to KDE4. 

With every new pre-release, updates are documented, allowing you to thoroughly test your Kubuntu installation. Remember that all of these features are part of a pre-release version of Kubuntu and may still have issues. We ask that you, for any problems you come across, file a bug if one has yet to be filed for your problem.<<BR>>

=== Qt 4.5 ===

Jaunty Jackalope Alpha 6 ships with latest Qt, version 4.5. Qt Software, formerly known as Trolltech, license QT 4.5 under the LGPL beneath  the GPL which will guarantee growing interests of commercial developers. Qt 4.5 brings a faster overall desktop experience, though as it is still very new it has not been extensively tested. You can help by finding new rough edges and bugs that occur with Qt 4.5.

=== KDE 4.2.1 ===

<nowiki>[[File:quassel40.png]]</nowiki>

<nowiki>[[http://quassel-irc.org/|Quassel]]</nowiki> is a new IRC client that is now the default for Kubuntu Jaunty.  It is feature-complete, but It still needs testing so that we can identify bugs and get them fixed.

While Quassel is a split client-core application, in Kubuntu the standalone version is installed. In version 0.4 a  new setup wizard makes it very easy to set up

=== Amarok 2.0.2 ===
Alpha 6 contains the recently-released Amarok 2.0.2, the second bugfix/enhancement release in the Amarok2 series including integration of online services such as Last.fm, LibriVox, Jamendo, Magnatune and more.

<nowiki>[[File:amarok202.png]]</nowiki>

Amarok 2 is now installed by default, and version 1.4 is no longer available from Kubuntu. Please test it, and alert the Kubuntu developers to regressions by filing bug reports.

=== New KDE 4 Network-Manager Plasma Widget ===
<nowiki>[[File:plasmoid-network-manager2.jpg]]</nowiki>

Alpha 6 contains the new plasma-widget-network-manager. Please file bugs against this new plasma widget if you encounter regressions from the older knetworkmanager applet.

KTorrent has been updated to version 3.2. The 3.2 release brings a modest amount of new features, a heaping of bugfixes and fixes for memory leaks. It also brings a new KTorrent plasmoid to grace your desktop with.

=== Kdebluetooth 0.3 ===
Kdebluetooth has been updated and is back (fixing the major bluetooth issues in Kubuntu 8.10), but needs work and lots of testing as well. Please give it a try and help out by filing bug reports.

=== choqoK ===
<nowiki>[[File:choqoK1.jpg]]</nowiki>

Micro blogging is very popular in the FOSS world. <nowiki>[[http://choqok.ospdev.net|ChoqoK]]</nowiki>, a client for KDE4, was releases in version 0.4 and is now available for installation in Jaunty from the Universe repository. It now has  support for direct messages and of course for identi.ca.
