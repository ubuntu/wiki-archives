__TOC__

David Krovich talked me into joining this loco over some beers.  But I don't drink beer, however, it was an easy choice to go loco.

I've made several Deb packages over the years for my projects.  One is for a project I am the lead developer for called the <nowiki>[[http://freesoftwarepc.com/projects/swim/|"Debian System Wide Information Manager"]]</nowiki> which is an rpm-like package manager for Debian derivative distros.

But, I didn't stop there, then I made a package for another project I am the lead developer for called <nowiki>[[http://freesoftwarepc.com/projects/gbootroot/|gBootRoot]]</nowiki> that simplifies the act of actually making a distribution via a GUI menu that includes a user-mode-linux testing platform.

Anyways, David told me about this Loco's goal of making meta-packages, some which would be unique to the needs of people living in this part of the country.  That's pretty cool, so here I am.
