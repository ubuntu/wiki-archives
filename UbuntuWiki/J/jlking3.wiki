=== About James King ===
Mr. King is an adjunct professor at <nowiki>[[http://www.fkcc.edu|Florida Keys Community College]]</nowiki>, where he uses Lubuntu extensively to teach his music appreciation and music theory classes. He also teaches piano lessons privately. Before discovering open source music tools (and before Creative Commons was--pardon the pun--commonplace), he composed, edited, engraved, and typeset a piano primer book named <nowiki>[[http://www.archive.com/details/LearningTheCode|Learning the Code]]</nowiki> and released it under the GNU FDL.
