=== Kubuntu Submersion ===
About 4 months ago I decided I was done with Windows and Microsoft.  I installed Kubuntu 7.04 on my Dell Latitude D420 and have been comletely satisfied.
The install was simple and without incident.  The only hiccup was installing ndiswrapper for the wireless card but even that was a snap with a little googling.
