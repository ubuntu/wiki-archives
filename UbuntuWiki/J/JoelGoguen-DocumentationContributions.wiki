=== Introduction ===
This page serves as a list of my contributions to the Ubuntu System Documentation.

=== Changes ===
* The '''Return''' key is not as well known as the '''Enter''' key, and currently '''Enter''' is the preferred and more popular reference.  I submitted a change to the system documentation for Jaunty which replaces references to the '''Return''' key with references to the '''Enter''' key.
