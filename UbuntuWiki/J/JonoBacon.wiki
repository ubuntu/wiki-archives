== Jono Bacon ==

Hello! I am Jono Bacon, and I work for Canonical as the Ubuntu Community Manager (UCM). As the UCM I am here to help the Ubuntu community tick along, ensure teams can work together easily, help build LoCo teams, work with upstream communities and more. Importantly, I am here for the Ubuntu community as someone to consult with with any community related issues. If you're unsure of anything, want to flesh some ideas out, or just want some advice, give me a yell. :)
