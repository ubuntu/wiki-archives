=== About Me ===
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| My name is Javier Puiggros, from Chile, 43 years old Electronic Engineer. I've been a GNU/Linux user for almost eight years now and have finally decided to get involved with Ubuntu and the Ubuntu Gnome project. Since I have no major experience in coding/hacking I will start supporting the Wiki in my free time.
