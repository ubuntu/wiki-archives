=== About me ===
I'm a network administrator & coordinator from Montréal, Québec. I'm interested in open source solutions & softwares for productivity, stability & cost reduction. I like to help people who wants to migrate from a proprietary solution to an open source solution to find the best alternatives. I also like to help coders to translate their applications in french for the Francophone community.

=== Projects ===
A blog is coming, I already have my domain name (jackdecarie.com), hehe.
