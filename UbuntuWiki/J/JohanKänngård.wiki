__TOC__

I am a Windows user trying to convert (as much as possible) to open source software. Have been fiddling with different types of *NIX dialects like NeXT, Red Hat, Gentoo and now Ubuntu. Have used Ubuntu desktop on my home server for about 2 years now, and it works great! You can find me on Launchpad at https://launchpad.net/~johan-kanngard and on Ubuntu Forums at http://ubuntuforums.org/member.php?u=449747. My personal mind dump can be found at http:/johankanngard.net.
