Laptop: HP Pavilion dv6338se

Currently Running: Kubuntu Hardy 64-bit

Kernel parameters:  I had to add noapic and noirqdebug to get things up and running.  The noirqdebug provides the USB ports to work and does not seem to affect the speed of the system.

Graphics Card Installation:

Used the linux-restricted-modules version.  Worked without any changes to xorg.conf but have not tried it with compiz fusion.  The KDE4 desktop effects work without any issues.

Wireless Card Installation:

I am currently using the b43 drivers by going through the linux-restricted-modules.  NDISwrapper is currently not working too well because it is running into conflicts with the ssb module.  There is current a bug reported in launchpad (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ndiswrapper/+bug/188621) that provides the workaround.  If you are to use NDISwrapper, you will need to use versions 1.50 or higher or else the code will not compile.

Modem:

The modem is a Conexant version so I do not have it activated at this time because of the cost.  Dell does provide a free version for the 32-bit version of Ubuntu but it does not appear to work with this laptop.

Webcam:

I have not fully tested this, but it does appear to work just fine right out of the box.
