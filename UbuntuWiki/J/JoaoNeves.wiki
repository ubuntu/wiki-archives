== About Me ==

I've been using Free Software since 1997, and advocating it since 1998. I lobbied for and setup the first classroom with GNU/Linux in my university. I've regularly attended and participated in Install Parties, events explaining Free Software and helping people in our country to meet together.

I'm a founder of <nowiki>[[http://ansol.org/|ANSOL]]</nowiki>, the Portuguese Free Software association. I've worked in the software patents lobbying effort that led to a software patents directive failing in the European Parliament in 2004. The lobby in Portugal regarding EUCD resulted in a law that makes Portugal the only country in the European Union where libdvdcss is legal.

I've started using Ubuntu in 2005 (Breezy). I've been advocating it since. I'm an active member of the Portuguese Ubuntu Community, the leader of Mozilla PT, President of ANSOL and a member of ESOP (the Portuguese Free Software Companies association).

Professionaly I'm a programmer/sysadmin that works with Free Software. I have my own company: <nowiki>[[http://intraneia.com/|Intraneia]]</nowiki> which has been a Ubuntu Partner and a Free Software supporter. We've migrated companies and schools to Ubuntu and keep expanding our efforts for better and bigger uses of Free Software.

Thanks to DougieRichardson whose template I reused.

== Contributions ==
=== LoCoTeam ===

In 2007, I've organized the Portuguese LoCoTeam participation on the first Portuguese Free Software Forum: http://anafigueiras.com/blog/2007/10/12/retrospectiva-do-1%C2%BA-dia-do-i-fsl/ (there you can see part of the 4x4m Ubuntu logo table we did). This participation was paid by my company.

I've organized the Ubuntu 8.10 Intrepid Ibex launch dinner in Lisbon, Portugal and did a presentation on what Ubuntu is.

I've started, organize and host the local Lisbon monthly meetings for Ubuntu users since September, 2008.

I'm a regular presence on the <nowiki>[[http://www.google.pt/search?q=joao.neves+site:lists.ubuntu.com+inurl:https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-pt/&hl=pt-PT&safe=off&client=firefox-a&rls=com.ubuntu:en-US:unofficial&hs=yjc&start=10&sa=N|mailing-list]]</nowiki> and irc channels.

=== Localization ===

I work mainly upstream, being the leader for European Portuguese Mozilla translations.

== Future Goals ==
In May I'll be presenting Ubuntu in a training session for public administration officials.

I want to work on making Marketing tools available in (European) Portuguese to expand the reach our community has.
