=== Absence ===

Due to GCSE work, and other commitments, I am unable to contribute to the Ubuntu Community at the quality I should, and therefore have decided to suspend my activity for a while.

If you need to get in touch with me, please email joseph [.] odell [at] googlemail [dot] com

Alternatively, catch me on IRC - My nickname is ascenseur
