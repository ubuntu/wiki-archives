'''Summary:''' I am an Ubuntu advocate. I promote Ubuntu through all of my affiliations listed below. Not being a paid IT person, I can present Linux in a very informal fashion. I like to say the I am a Linux plumber, when I hack, you can see the crack of my ass. I am a salesman, and I love to perform. I am very passionate about Linux and Ubuntu.

'''Future aspirations:''' To continue to promote Ubuntu and involvement with Open Source to everyone I encounter. As Team Contact, to provide all the information to the PA team members so that they may promote Ubuntu as individuals, and as regions. To support all PA team member and region endeavors with the best of my abilities.

== Testimonials ==

=== Name Email addy and comment please ===

When I was starting up the NJ LoCo team, Jim supported me every chance he got. When we held our first install fest, he drove all over creation flyering for us. He made it to every event he could; even when he couldn't, he'd stop by the day before with more bread than we could possibly eat.

Jim gave me the support I needed, and I gladly support his application for membership -- <nowiki>[[JoeTerranova]]</nowiki>

=== From David A. Harding <dave@dtrt.org> ===

'''Don't make Jim Fisher an Ubuntu member'''--that's not enough--make him Chief Ubuntu Evangelist. Before I met Jim in 2007, I thought I was a Linux enthusiast--but Jim's electrifying enthusiasm for Linux and Ubuntu blew me away. Compared to him, I'm a mere dabbler.

Jim doesn't care about Ubuntu--he cares about individual people.  There isn't a problem he won't try to fix or a hack he won't spend a week working on just to make someone happy--and if he can't do it himself, he'll move heaven and earth to find someone who can.

This testimonial sucks because I can't describe in just a few words the numerous invaluable contributions Jim has made over the last five years to the Pennsylvania (PA) LoCo, the former New Jersey (NJ) LoCo, the Philadelphia (PA) LUG, the Cherry Hill (NJ) LUG, PACS Linux (PA), numerous other groups, and anyone who visits #ubuntu-us-pa or #ubuntu-us-nj.  Jim Fisher has been invaluable to our local community--please give him his just desserts.  --<nowiki>[[DavidAHarding]]</nowiki>
