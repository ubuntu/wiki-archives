== About me ==

I am a high school computer science teacher in the Washington, DC metro area.  I've been a Free Software advocate since 1995, and I've been using Free Software in my classroom enviroment for the past 8 years.

I am a huge fan of the Python progamming language, which I use in my first year CS classes.

My friend PaulFlint introduced me to Ubuntu last December, when he dressed up as Santa Claus ("Saint Nicholinus", he says) and handed out "Warty" C Ds.  "Hoary" got me hooked, and I've been installing Ubuntu everywhere I go.

I attended the UbuntuDownUnder conference with friend and soon to be former student, ColinApplegate,
where I worked on the specification for Edubuntu.  I hope to be heavily involved in Edubuntu testing, and will be
setting up several Edubuntu sites in my community.

I am also actively involved with the SchoolTool project, as project manager for a competency tracking application
called CanDo being written by two of my former students which is being built on top of SchoolTool.
