__TOC__

I guess this means there's another James Ho around here, but he has yet to create a page. Oh well.

In any case, I'm obviously a new user of Ubuntu, but I wanted to sign on to the Wiki pronto because I have an interest and a little experience with Wikis. As an information developer for a software company, I'm certainly interested in documentation, though I suspect any contributions I make here will be very minor.
