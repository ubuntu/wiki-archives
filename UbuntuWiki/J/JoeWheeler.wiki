=== About Me ===
I live in the Uk and am currently studying computing at university. 
I first started using linux(specifically Ubuntu) about half a year ago(mid 2009) after my laptop got swamped by viruses; I've never looked back!
I'm now a strong advocate of open source and the philosophy of Ubuntu
==== Programming Ability ====
I've just started a four year course at uni studying mainly Java and I would say I'm fairly competent in it, however I'm also practising python in my spare time and am planning to learn C++ in the near future

=== Team Memberships ===

==== Goals ====

Short term:
To develop my programming proficiency enough to enable me to start fixing bugs and better the Ubuntu community
