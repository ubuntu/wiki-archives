== About Me ==
My name is Ye Myat Kaung. I'm from Myanmar. Currently studying in <nowiki>[[http://www.apiit.edu.my|APIIT]]</nowiki>/<nowiki>[[http://www.ucti.edu.my|UCTI]]</nowiki>, Malaysia. My nick "Joe '''Maverick''' Sett" originated from the fact that my real name is hard to pronounce! I was introduced to Ubuntu from a guy I knew. I started out with Ubuntu Lucid Lynx, so, Windows is no longer running on my machines! :-) Even though I've had several re-formats and things not working, I just couldn't give up on Ubuntu, so, currently very much in liking it.

=== Interests in Ubuntu ===
Last time I tried to compile my own kernel and failed badly (due to messing up the steps!). So, I'm willing to learn more about the kernel. And, of course, the Operating System's file structures. More on "[Security hole] Bugs"!

So, currently my main interests;
1. Linux Kernel
2. File Structure
3. Bugs (has a decent knowledge of bug triaging/reporting)
4. Security Related to Linux Distro(s) / SELinux
5. Coding

=== Involvement with the Ubuntu Community ===

|}

* <nowiki>[[zkriesse]]</nowiki> - helped the first time I stepped into the Ubuntu IRC world as well as getting to know the various teams and how they operated. He showed me how to make GPG keys, signing up for launchpad and applying for Ubuntu Teams. He also got me into <nowiki>[[UbuntuYouth]]</nowiki>. He helped/mentored me with a wiki bug I was working on which of course lead to my successful wiki contributions. 

* <nowiki>[[Mohan_chml]]</nowiki> - showed me how the Ubuntu Beginners Team operated, the backbones behind the team. He got me into various IRC channels so that I could communicate more with the Ubuntu Community members. He also urged me to try the wiki Bug: Bug:#605468 as I still did not have strong technical skills to help out in the community.

==== Other Involvements ====
Although I've no programming knowledge and strong Linux knowldege, I like testing various Ubuntu variants or some Linux distros that interests me. Here are some of the variants I test out according to what my knowledge can offer.

===== Lubuntu =====
As <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lubuntu|Lubuntu]]</nowiki> is a new baby Ubuntu variant with it's lighweight desktop designed for "older" computers. I regulary use it or test things that I see people discussing in #lubuntu irc channel.

=== Internet Relay Chat(IRC) ===

My registered IRC nickname is "JoeMaverickSett" (now goes by the nick '''MavJS'''.  I am looking forward to getting to know the Ubuntu community members and learn from them, better through this medium. But I am usually present in the following channels to either learn from or help out;

=== Goals For The Future ===

3. To learn how to do <nowiki>[[Packaging]]</nowiki>, and contribute in packaging.
4. To learn the basics of programming, web development.
5. To share my knowledge in Ubuntu to new comers.
