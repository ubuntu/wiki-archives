=== About Me ===

I am a self-taught programmer who hopes to provide a net benefit to the ubuntu community.

I have a simple blog at <nowiki>[[http://kaens.blogspot.com]]</nowiki>, that I update rather infrequently.

I am currently in the planning phase of a website-as-service that would allow people to customize their ubuntu installation/live cd/dvd.

=== Ubuntu-related projects that are available online ===

* Packagedepends
  <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/pd]]</nowiki>
  Currently a simple proof-of-concept implementation of the idea posted at <nowiki>[[http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/idea/11232/]]</nowiki>. It provides a (currently very simplistic) web-based partial front-end to apt that allows people to download a tarfile of a package and its dependencies.

  Current development version of it is hosted on my machine at <nowiki>[[http://packagedepends.homelinux.org:8080]]</nowiki> feel free to check it out, and use it if you have a need for it.
