=== About Me ===

I am from small town Bogatic in Serbia. I am in my last year at Faculty of Organizational Sciences in Belgrade, studyng for computer science. 

I use Linux for 4 years now, but have not been active member in any global community. 

=== Future Plans ===

I want to add my contribution to Ubuntu community. The field that I'm interested the most is software development. I don't have any previous experience as Linux developer, but I do have some knowledge in programing in general.

=== Contributions to the Ubuntu Community ===

Not yet any to show, but hope there will be some, soon...
