=== About Me ===

===== Hi! =====
My name is Jenny Lööw as you might have guessed. I was born in October 1987 and that means I turn 18 later this year.
I started to use Linux 2002 when I meet my boyfriend ChristianBjälevik. In the beginning I was using Gentoo and after a while I switched to Debian, but now I'm using only Ubuntu.

I've been <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/people/gothcat/+translations|translating in Rosetta]]</nowiki> since that service first appeared and is now a member of Ubuntu Swedish Translators. I'm also one of the contactpersons for the SwedishTeam loco and would like to contribute to the LaptopTestingTeam.
Since I'm an art student and a member on <nowiki>[[http://gothicblackcat.deviantart.com/|DeviantART]]</nowiki>, I'm thinking of joining Ubuntu ArtTeam.

=== How do I look? ===
