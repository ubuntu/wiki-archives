__TOC__

Because Launchpad is heavily used and critical for QA activities in Ubuntu it is important that Ubuntu QA is well represented to the Launchpad development and management teams.

<pre>
Liaison:
one that establishes and maintains communication for mutual understanding and cooperation
</pre>

The liaison's duties:
** Provide Launchpad developers with prioritized bugs/specs relevant to Ubuntu QA
** Provide Ubuntu QA with information on Launchpad changes and progress
** Drive discussion around needed Launchpad changes or possible bug fixes
** Advocate on behalf of Ubuntu QA to Launchpad developers and management
** Do the all of the above in as transparent and collaborative of a way as possible

Some useful liaison activities:
** Solicit Launchpad feedback on a specific change or Launchpad feature
** Solicit individual priority bugs affecting QA
