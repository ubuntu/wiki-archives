I live in Delray Beach, FL and really am not that much of a computer nerd.  I like to play around with things, though I cannot program all that well except in Visual Basic.  As it turns out, VB is pretty much useless in the world of Linux.

I seem to have a knack for pointing out trivial errors in spelling, punctuation and grammar, so if I edit your page, please do not be offended...I just have too much time on my hands.

(More to come later)
