=== About Me ===

---- /!\ '''Edit conflict - other version:''' ----
I'm from Philippines, currently a computer Engineering student. I started using ubuntu back in 2008 but not as my primary desktop. I installed it inside windows. Until this year I decided to completely move to ubuntu. I also tried different distros like puppy linux, centos, back track, and so many more. Right now I am busy messing around with python, taking some challenges at projecteuler.net.
