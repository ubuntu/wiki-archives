== WARNING ==
* Post known issues here
* (almost) no support for ATI graphics card + KDE desktop effects (fglrx doesn't work with Jaunty's xserver, <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/fglrx-installer/+bug/313027|bug 313027]]</nowiki> , and there are reports of open source drivers being very slow).

== Feedback ==
* Add feedback here
* With 9.4 alpha 4, I can not configure the printers - System Settings : Printer Configuration reports the following error : The service 'Printer Configuration' does not provide an interface 'KCModule'
* I would be using alpha 3 if I could use the nvidia driver,  i like alpha 3 alot   : )
* I would REALLY like to see KDE 3 packages for recent releases.  I would like to have up-to-date software (such as the latest kernel and NVIDIA drivers), but am really not ready to do a full jump to KDE 4.2 yet. - 
* I would like the proxysettings under kde controlpanel work global like in Ubuntu, so its not only kde apps which can use the proxy settings.
* Alpha 4 installed and runs almost good on my system (Lenovo Thinkpad R61, Intel Core Duo CPU). Just some observations:
** One serious problem: I don't get the (wired) network running. The right kernel module seems to be loaded (e1000e), but I get "Network unreachable". Furthermore, the promised NetworkManagerPlasma doesn't start (Component missing). When starting knetworkmanager, the network still doesn't run - can't ping or anything. I try to make this a bugreport, but given that I have no network, this is not as simple as it might sound....
   ''Update:'' The network manager applet came up after the second login, so that is solved. I still do not get a network connection, even though I got an IP address, and DNS works. I have filed this as a <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/326802|bug report]]</nowiki>.
** The system comes up pretty fast, and goes down even faster. Very nice.
** KDE 4.2 is really a big improvement over the previous versions, although 4.1 was at least usable.
 -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:olenz]]</nowiki>  * Static IP configuration does not work... again... -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:orkanspec]]</nowiki>  * As reported above, to get a wired connection, you have to manually create it in networkmanager.  In fact, in alpha 4, the networkmanager widget somehow failed to install itself and showed an ! on the taskbar during the first login, then it went away.  When I installed the widget manually it worked fine, but I did have to manually create the eth0 connection, and tell it to use DHCP.  Perhaps this is because I installed the OS while not connected to the net.  Other issues are: I see a crash of nepomukservicestub when logging in (there is already a bug for this), and, very irritatingly, in Konqueror flash is only intermittent. Sometimes (about 1 out of 20 times) it works fine, usually it just leaves a box on the screen and does nothing. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:mgolden]]</nowiki>  * 180 nvidia driver (installed by adept) freezes soon after showing desktop.  64bit alpha-4, M3a78-em mb, 8gig ram, 8400gs graphics hw.
* I am unable to get alpha 4 to run at all on my Sony Vaio PCG-FX370P.  I am not trying to install, I was just trying to run the livecd.  If I don't run in Safe Graphics Mode I see some truly amazing screen corruption when it tries to start the kde desktop.  When I do run in Safe Graphics Mode, it gets further.  I see the screen as 800x600 (even though the display is actually 1024x768), and I get the four loading icons rather nicely, until the desktop itself tries to start.  In this case, it runs for a while but it looks like the graphics mode is wrong. Eventually it goes black and you can't see anything happening. This is probably related to the problem solved on this page: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?s=72f59c2cf1619716545a09aa64a36844&t=972062 -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:mgolden]]</nowiki>  * It is possible to add the new networkmanager widget to plasma, but this new widget won't work, because it does NOT save WPA passwords. The old knetworkmanager works properly. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:wkrakowski]]</nowiki>
** UPDATE: After further checking it seems that the new plasma widget for networkmanager won't work properly in livecd, but it will on an installed system - at least it does for me.
* The touchpad doesn' work correctly - due to a known issue not mentioned in the Alpha4 announcement, but present in the technical overview for Jaunty: https://wiki.kubuntu.org/JauntyJackalope/TechnicalOverview. <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:wkrakowski]]</nowiki>
** UPDATE: it works correctly on an installed system with the synaptics driver installed from adept. Still, I think that this driver is important and must be present on the livecd. Why won't Kubuntu dev remove the mouse driver from the livecd? BTW, I'm sure that the touchpad driver doesn't need much space and can fit. It always was on previous live cd... Also, the present driver is not very good, especially for the scrolling. It works, but lacks precision.
* What about supporting laptop keys for sound and brightness on Sony laptops? They are supported out of the box for other brands (Acer just to name one). Is it so difficult to integrate this? There already is some kind of driver (sonypi)... <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:wkrakowski]]</nowiki>
* I really love Alpha 4 on my Inspiron 1525 laptop.  Jaunty already seems to be the most stable I have seen at the Alpha stage.  The new Network Management applet works perfectly for me.  Keep up the good work. <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:sclewin]]</nowiki>
