Hi there, I'm Jonathan Musther, a user and great fan of Ubuntu.  I'm currently using Gutsy (7.10).

One little contribution I've made is AutoFsck (have a look at it, you may well find it useful).

Also check out my FOSS game, slingshot (http://www.slingshot-game.org).

I've just signed up to help the documentation team...  Yay!
