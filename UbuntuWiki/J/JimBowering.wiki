I have 20 years of experience as a computer user, the last 5 in various Linux distributions.  I've always wanted to make a contribution to Free Software but was reluctant to try.  Not being a coder of any sort I didn't think there was a place for me.  That's why I'm so glad to have this chance to pitch in on the documentation for Ubuntu.

Debian is my favorite root distribution, although I respect the other ones: RPMs, Slack, source-based.  Ubuntu looks like the perfect fit for Debian's Free Software focus as well as for my philosophical bias.

I write a weekly column for my local newspaper on the subject of science and technology, so I have the skills needed to produce clear, concise text.  That is why I will start contributing to this documentation project with proofreading and editing.  Later, as I get more experience, I hope to be involved in creating new docs.  Time will tell.
