==== About Me ====

Hi, my name is Michael SanAngelo. I run Ubuntu Linux 7.10 on my computer with WinXP for games and iTunes. I spend my time on the IRC freenode servers. I enjoy viewing pictures on the web and watching video on YouTube. My hobbies include fixing and repairing computers and playing with anything that runs on electricity. Ubuntu is my most favorite os and WinXP falls in second. I know I complain about the two but who doesn't. I operate two computer can maintain all the current computers in the house.
