=== About Me ===
Hi my name is James (jamesrfla everywhere else). I started using Linux when slax 5.0.6 (Saturday, January 28, 2006). I never installed it just played with it. Later I found Ubuntu and downloaded Ubuntu 7.04(Saturday, May 05, 2007). I needed help with it and got a ubuntuforums.org (jamesrfla) account September 8th, 2007. I primarily used it for a file server. Later I got interested in servers and got Windows Small Business Server 2003 R2 Standard Edition. I liked what it was able to do but it used so much RAM. I decided to get Ubuntu 8.04 and setup a Web server, Mail server, SSH server, File Server, and a Terminal Sever. Since then I have been using Ubuntu on a regular basis.
