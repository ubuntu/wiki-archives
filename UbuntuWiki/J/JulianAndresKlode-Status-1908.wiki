== Status for 2019-08-02 -> 2019-08-08 ==

* Hack around broken procenv in eoan breaking sbuild and pbuilder autopkgtest everywhere
* hotfix python-apt so snapd builds in eoan (LP: #1837926), needs a cleaner fix, but that needs work in bindings
* Released apt  1.9.2
* Verify dpkg SRUs
* Answered questions about which apt binary packages need upgrading needed for trusty ESM
* Some initial analysis and workarounds in autopkgtest for the i386 autopkgtest queue being stuck, which turned out to be a gnutls bug (LP: #1839354)

== Status for 2019-08-09 -> 2019-08-15 ==

* uploaded gpgme1.0 to bionic to fix FTBFS there (LP: #1813581)
* otherwise, it's been kind of an *apt* week.
* released apt 1.8.3, (fake-ish)-synced to disco, 1.8.3~deb10u1 for Debian stable (LP: #1838771 amongst others)
* fixed a segmentation fault introduced in apt 1.9.2 (https://salsa.debian.org/apt-team/apt/merge_requests/73, LP: #1839714)
* wondering why dpkg SRU was released on disco and xenial but not bionic (that's not a sane order ;))
* learned more about AppStream and what the needs are on a package management daemon side
* started preparing to run black on python-apt code
also as a special announcement: APT PATTERNS (for packages) ARE HERE! (https://salsa.debian.org/apt-team/apt/merge_requests/74) 
* Purge config files: apt purge ?config-files
* Remove autoremovable packages: apt remove ?garbage
* Install packages with weird queries: apt install ?or(?name(^apt$),?and(?true,?false))
* Show all upgradable packages: apt-cache show ?upgradable
* Caveats: It's not working for search and inside preferences files so far
* https://people.debian.org/~jak/apt-search-terms.html contains more info (but is badly rendered; it's apt-patterns(5) manpage).
* Patterns for versions coming at a later point, but trying to get them in before feature freeze
* Will be writing a blog post about that stuff, it's super exciting.
