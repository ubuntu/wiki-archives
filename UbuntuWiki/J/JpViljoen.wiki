__TOC__

Multi-distro user, at the moment giving the latest Ubuntu (8.04) a test drive. Always one of the first to try out new things, and I love a good bughunt. I believe in the open source philosophy, and am often dissatisfied that open source software ends up "second-rate" to alternatives out there (albeit for whatever reasons), and thus I do my part in tryng to improve everything as much as possible.
