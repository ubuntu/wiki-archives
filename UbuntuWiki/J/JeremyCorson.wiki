Introduction:

I am a J2EE developer for a fortune 100 company. I have made the switch to 100% Ubuntu about a year ago. I am a true believer in the open source community and I would like to start contributing where I can. I'm looking for some mentoring in the development process of Ubuntu. I dont have a specific area of interest yet. I'm sure i'll take a interest to what ever someone whats to show me! I also don't mind Triageing tickets either.
