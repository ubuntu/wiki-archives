=== About ===

Hello all,

I'm a 50 something Ubuntu Linux Addict, avid bicycler, and 2nd Amendment supporter.  Being raised in a military family and living all around the world taught me a few things; be disciplined, be ready for things to change rapidly, remain calm and don't sweat the small stuff.  Well, after spending a decade trying MSFT and several flavors of *NIX, someone handed me an Ubuntu disk: Edgy Eft. This was sometime in '06.  The installation was the easiest I had ever been through.  Then I started finding out how much support and documentation was available.  I haven't looked back.  Since then I've tried Kubuntu, Ubuntu, and Xubuntu.  Right now I run Ubuntu on my laptop and desktop.  Normally I dual-boot my desktop with Kubuntu so when the mood suits me I can look for bugs in Kubuntu. The Ubuntu mindset seems to be flexible, fast moving, and above all friendly and helpful.  It's a great thing to be a part of.  I'm proud to be part of the Hottest Lo``Co on Earth: the Arizona Lo``Co Team.  The AZ Lo``Co has some great leaders in John Crawford (johnc4510) and Craig Eddy (tyche).  There are other members that exhibit the spirit of Ubuntu: Kenny Mc``Henry (kennymc0) and Shane Lofgren (slofgren), among others.  I can't name all the members that have helped me in this Lo``Co and in the Ubuntu Community at large.  This spirit of giving has prompted me to give back in any way I can, so here I am.

=== Testimonials ===

Sean Fenton - Owner, Breakwater Networks, Oklahoma City, OK (service@breakwaternetworks.com): Scott has been a friend of mine for many years.  He is very intelligent, naturally inquisitive and a social butterfly   (a people person, if you like).  This makes him a great fit for the community.  After a couple years as a user, exploring the *buntus and getting to know the system on his computers, he's refocusing his energy on benefiting the community and operating system he loves best.  Watch out, bugs, your days are numbered.

Craig A. Eddy (tyche@ubuntu.com):  Scott is an active go-getter.  He has constantly tried to provide a steady contribution to the Team and the wider Ubuntu community.  He is friendly, outgoing, and able to get other people involved in his projects.  Yet he isn't overpowering, or trying to take over a group, but rather supports the group and it's leaders whoever they may be.  The questions he asks are good, and the answers he provides to others are just as good.  I feel privileged to have been associated with him.

Kenny Mc``Henry (kennymc0@ubuntu.com): Every time I turn around Scott seems to be involved with a new project with the team or the community as a whole. He isn't the kind of person to go and step on toes and steal leadership from people, rather he helps whenever he can and helps anyone shoulder any responsibility that they can't quite handle on their own. You can always see him at an install fest, and if you ask nicely enough, he may even give you a ride to one. Scott can be a great asset to the team and the community as a whole now and will continue to be in the future.

James Mc``Phee (jmcphe@gmail.com):  Scott is one of the most active members of the AZ Loco and has shouldered a lot of the effort to keep it an active and thriving community.  We would not be the Loco we are without him and he deserves recognition for that.  He also possesses a very smooth leadership style that keeps things moving.  I defer to him on things Loco.

JohnCrawford - Scott is a great Ubuntu example. He has worked very hard for the Arizona team, he is in our IRC channel constantly and gives a welcome or lends a helping hand to anyone needing it, he has help out or organized several installfest, and he has also started volunteering with the Ubuntu Weekly Newsletter. If there is something that needs attention, Scott is the go to guy. Scott follows the Ubuntu Code of Conduct. I give Scott my wholehearted backing and vote for Ubuntu Membership.

Scott Scott Scott...what can I say that will do him justice that others have not already said? He's an active member of the Ubuntu Community, not to mention the <nowiki>[[ArizonaTeam|Arizona Team LoCo]]</nowiki>. He's always helpful and ready to assist those who need help, and is always ready to learn from others and share his knowledge with those around him, myself included. I've had a great time knowing him and I hope that our friendship will continue. He's got my full support in any endeavor which he chooses and I fully support his application to Ubuntu Membership. Please look upon his application favorably. <nowiki>[[zkriesse]]</nowiki>

Doorman352 - Scott demonstrates the spirit of Ubuntu in everything he does. I have always found him willing to contribute to the community and to help volunteer. He has always impressed me with his drive for knowledge and understanding. I've never known him to use his knowledge or experience to oppress anyone, in fact he shares it willingly, and expects nothing in return. I would endorse Scott's application for membership without reservation.

MattHelmke - Scott is a great guy doing wonderful things for the Arizona LoCo. He should be an official member and I'm convinced he will continue to be an asset to the community. Unfortunately, I'm working during the meeting (with no IRC access) but I'm sure the decision to make him a member will be quick and easy.

Joel Zehring: I've only been running Ubuntu for six months, but I found the AZ LoCo within a few days of install, thanks in large part to Scott. His name and handle pop up all over Ubuntu websites, wikis, forums and channels, all of which are relevant and current. He helped rolled out Google Apps accounts for AZ LoCo participants, and his weekly emails have helped me to stay up-to-date on Ubuntu news and events both local and world-wide. Most importantly, Scott inspires an open, welcoming culture among Ubuntu users that has made it completely easy for me to leave those "other" operating systems and use Ubuntu 100% on my personal computer.
