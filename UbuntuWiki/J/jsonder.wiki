__TOC__

My name is John Sonderegger.  I'm a retired hydrogeologist living in Green Valley, Arizona.

I started dinking with linux in 1996, burning out on Caldera and Corel distros.  In 2001 I put one computer solely on linux because I needed a free drawing program for textbook figures.  That computer later became the photo printer because HP's software for their photosmart printer was "erratic" under Windows 2000. 

I had helped develop advanced Windows XP classes for the Computer Club of Green Valley, but became tired of the ongoing malware battles and started a Linux SIG with the club in 2004.  We started there using Fedora Core (no numbers for core 1), and also supported Mepis and later Ubuntu.

Currently I run Ubuntu 9.10 on a Dell Inspiron 1505 notebook and an HP Pavilion 724c desktop.  On the Ubuntu forums, I am sometimes found in the PPC area, as I run the current debian on a Mac Mini. 

I also play with motorcycles, not always safely as indicated from the year old picture (Sept. 2006):

Lately I've been trail riding a lot and not spending much time on computer stuff. (I can do that when I get too old for motorcycles)
