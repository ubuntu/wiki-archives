__TOC__

I've been using Linux since around 1994 when I was given a 386 in return for repairing and old BBC Micro. I had used mostly Acorn Machines up to that point, from the Electron/BBC to the A5000. I let my poor old 2400bps modem run for what seemed like days downloading the Slackware disks. Fast forward 12 years and now I'm a Unix/Linux sysadmin. Little did I know all the pleasure and trouble those few floppy disks would bring.

I've installed pretty much every major distribution between '94 and now, but usually ended up back with Debian, or a Debian based system. I've been using Ubuntu now for about a year as my main desktop OS in work and have finally gotten around to installing Dapper Drake 64bit at home.
