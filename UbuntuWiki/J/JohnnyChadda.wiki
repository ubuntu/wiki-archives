Hello World!

I am Johnny Chadda and I have been a Linux user since 1997 or so. The distributions I currently use are of course Ubuntu, but also pure Debian.

I have been a Enlightenment and KDE user for a long time, but lately I mostly run Gnome. I guess that depends on Ubuntu for making Gnome such so perfect and well integrated with the rest of the system.

I do, on occasion write in my blog, and many posts are about Linux and specifically Ubuntu. It is located here:

Have a good one.
