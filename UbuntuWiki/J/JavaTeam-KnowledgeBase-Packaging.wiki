This guide tries to explain packaging from the point of view of a Java developer.

Note to Debian / Ubuntu wizard: please help me correct this guide in relation to Debian packaging guidelines.

== Prerequisites ==
* Read the <nowiki>[[PackagingGuide|packaging guide]]</nowiki> or have at least a look to the <nowiki>[[MeetingLogs-openweekintrepid-Packaging|packaging 101 session]]</nowiki>
* a <nowiki>[[http://launchpad.net|Launchpad]]</nowiki> account
* Ubuntu with these packages installed: build-essential cdbs debhelper devscripts unzip bzr ant
<pre>
  sudo apt-get install build-essential cdbs debhelper devscripts unzip bzr ant
</pre>
* configure your name and contact email address for Debian packaging: add to your .bashrc file:
<pre>
## Debian packaging
  export DEBEMAIL=john.doe@mail.com
  export DEBFULLNAME="John Doe"
</pre>
* create a working directory 
* cd into that directory 

== Packaging ==
=== Before you package a library or program ===
* check the extension license for main, universe suitability.
* check if the library or program was already packaged in Debian or Ubuntu (search http://packages.debian.org/ or search in Synaptic)
* if it was not created before, create a new project in Launchpad. If you are packaging a pure library (no main() method), call it lib<name>-java. If it's a program, use its lowercase name.

=== Packaging Procedure ===
==== Common steps ====
* create a project for your Debian package
 <pre>
mkdir $PROJECT
cd $PROJECT
bzr init
mkdir .bzr-builddeb/ 
echo -e '[BUILDDEB]\nmerge = True' > .bzr-builddeb/default.conf 
bzr add .bzr-builddeb/default.conf
bzr add debian/
bzr commit -m "* Initial setup"
bzr push lp://~$LAUNCHPAD_ID/uj/$PROJECT 
 </pre>
* Use dch to inform of the changes in your package (not the code changes from upstream, only what has changed in the Debian packaging)
