Hi, my name is Jack. I'm originally from Ireland but currently living in Korea. I'm fairly new to computer programming and completely new to linux. I'm still finding my feet with ubuntu but I think I generally know enough to know how to find the answers I need online! I'm interested in all aspects of linux at the moment and, would love the opportunity to get to know a little more about it through debugging and documentation. I speak English and (a little) Irish and I am available between half five and half seven most Mondays Wednesdays and Thursdays.
