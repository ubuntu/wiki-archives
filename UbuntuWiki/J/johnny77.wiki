== About Me ==
Hello, for as long as I can remember computers have fascinated me. From my first experiences to Windows 3.1 and MS-DOS to my more recent experiences on Ubuntu, I've loved it all. I first heard of Ubuntu probably 5 years ago. I was intrigued with a free OS, but never got around to installing it. Recently I finally took the plunge and set up a dual-boot with Windows XP. Now Ubuntu is my main OS and I'm not looking back.

=== Community Involvement ===
I haven't had much community involvement, but would like to help out as I was. I've been hanging out in the Absolute Beginners sub forum and #Ubuntu-beginners channel to help as I can, hoping to learn more to allow me to help other beginners. 

==== Forums ====
When I get the opportunity, I can be found at one of these forums, trying to help out others as my knowledge allows me.

* <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=326|Beginners Forum]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[http://askubuntu.com|Ask Ubuntu]]</nowiki>

==== IRC ====
Here is the place I probably will be spending the majority of my time as I try to help others. Listed below are the channels that I can be found. 
* #Ubuntu-beginners
* #Ubuntu-beginners-team
* #Ubuntu-beginners-wiki

==== Teams & Focus Groups ====
Only starting to get involved, I'm not currently a member of any Teams or Focus Groups. But I'm working toward becoming a member of the Ubuntu Beginners Team. I was helped by a few really nice people from this team and want to repay the community. <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/seidos|seidos]]</nowiki> offered to be my master, leading me in the ways of becoming a UBT member. I graciously accepted and am excited to learn and become a UBT member. Once a member of the UBT, I would like to join the Documentation Focus group to help with the Community Documentation Wiki. 

==== Community Contributions ====
I have contributed on the following parts of the Community Documentation Wiki.

=== Projects & Goals ===
Here is my current and future goals.

* Learn how to constructively add to the Community Documentation.
* Become a member of the Ubuntu Beginners Team.
