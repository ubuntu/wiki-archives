== Who I am ==
I am a member of the Ubuntu Kernel Team working for Canonical on the Ubuntu Kernel, and AppArmor development.  Currently I am working on security and general bug fixing in the Kernel.  I am also an upstream developer for the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/apparmor|AppArmor]]</nowiki> project.

== My Ubuntu story ==
Blame Kees, he got me involved years ago back when I was working for another distro.  At first it was just the upstream AppArmor work, fixes for bugs that surfaced in Ubuntu.  But of course that meant I had to start running Ubuntu to do development and testing (I am sure that was all part of Kees's evil master plan).  Then I managed to weedled (got other distro to pay for it) my way into going to UDS Boston.  That was quite the experience and off of that I actually pushed for the other distro I was working for to do something similar because, well UDS was really good, and it just made sense (alas they didn't listen).

Well some more time, and now UDS in SunnyVale rolled around (that other distro wasn't paying this time, I did try), but I wanted to go so I, decided to pay for the trip myself.  Well Kees of course heard about this and jumped in and got me a very last minute sponsorship.
