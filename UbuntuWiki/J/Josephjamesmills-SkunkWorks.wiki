=== Other Examples ===

  I think that there is a million and a half reasons that I am the ideal person for the Skunks works experiment. The best, being that I love Ubuntu and have a feeling that I always will. I listen to people when there talking but yet I am not afraid to stick up for my thoughts. I can spend many hours working on projects because at the current time I am un-employed. I am not afraid to say OK I made a mistake and you are right. To be honest I think that there are many people that are better at programming then I am. But I will always be there and I will never quit. I am a fast learner but like to cover all my steps along the way. I am not afraid to ask for help at all, and find myself doing that often on IRC. After going to the last UDS(R) and meeting some of the developers there. I have come to realize that I myself want to become a Ubuntu Developer. I thank you for taking the time to look this over, and think that this project is just awesome. At any rate this looks like a good chance for me too get my foot in the door so to say.
