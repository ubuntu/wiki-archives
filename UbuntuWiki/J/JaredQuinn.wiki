== About Me ==
Hi, I'm <nowiki>[[http://jaredquinn.info|Jared Quinn]]</nowiki>, and live in <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney|Sydney (Australia)]]</nowiki>.

I have been using Ubuntu since Hoary Hedgehog, though my Linux experience extends back before Linux kernel 1.0.  I first installed Slackware from a set of floppy disks in 1989.

I have spent most of my IT career as a UNIX systems admin, working with Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, IRIX, Tru64, various BSDs and various Linux.
