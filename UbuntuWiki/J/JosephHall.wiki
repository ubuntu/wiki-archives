== About Me ==
My name is Joseph Hall.  I am 30 years old and work full-time as QA Engineer, and part time as a perl programmer and a pastry chef.  I joined the Ubuntu Utah Team in the winter of 2006/2007, and immediately found a home with the talented members of that team.  Currently I am working with local LUG leaders to organize the Utah Open Source Conference for mid-2007.
