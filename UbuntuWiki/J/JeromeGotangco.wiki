I am from the Philippines. I have found the Ubuntu community to be one of the most active and aggressive in pushing GNU/Linux as a platform of choice for everyday computing.

I used to be part of the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~communitycouncil|Ubuntu Community Council]]</nowiki>, the community governance board which determines the social policies and structure of the Ubuntu Project. <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/community/processes/council|Read more about the Community Council]]</nowiki>. I voluntarily stepped down from the council in 2007.

I also served as part of the Edubuntu Council in 2006.

Most of my spare time is now being put to good use in working towards a small, but effective implementation of OLPC and Sugar as learning tools for displaced children in my locality.
