==== About ====

{{http://john-hunt.com/me_smallish.jpg}}

Hello! My name is John Hunt.

I am a gnu/linux user, and have been using various distributions full time over the last 6 years or so. I have been using Ubuntu since 2006 (on and off).

I live in Terrigal, New South Wales in Australia.

==== Projects ====

I work full time, so my spare time for contributing to open source projects is fairly limited. However, I currently help moderate the #category5 chat room on freenode and intend to make some screencasts for the [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ScreencastTeam|Ubuntu Screencast Team] in the near future.
