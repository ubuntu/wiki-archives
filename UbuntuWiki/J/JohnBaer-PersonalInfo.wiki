===== Personal =====

I am a software development project manager whose interests include Art, Ubuntu, Open Source, Agile software development, and Community Leadership. As a user and tester of Ubuntu beginning with Warty Warthog and a contributor dating back to Dapper Drake my desire is to add value to the community. My belief is I will do so with a greater level of effectiveness as a member of the community.

===== Testimonials =====

John was a great help in creating the Lucid count down banners. Not only did he create a great image, he was a superb team player, working with other artists to refine it. I consider this going a step above since it is all too common for contributions to be "left at the door step."
