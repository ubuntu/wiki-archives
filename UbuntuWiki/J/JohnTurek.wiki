__TOC__

Hello! I am John Turek.  By day I am a IP/Voice Engineer for a large telecom company.  By night, I give as much as possible to the open source community.

I am a Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud advocate, utilizing UEC in 3 different networks that I manage.  

Over the years I have assisted in enhancing the Pidgin, centerim, xmonad, BitchX and various emacs libraries.
 
I have been a Unix user since the early days of SuSE, and I have utilized Ubuntu as a Server and Desktop since Warty.
