=== About Me ===
I am interested in creating documentation for Ubuntu.

I have converted all the computers in my house to Ubuntu and they are all working the way they should.
I am interested in learning how to program but haven't decided where to start to learn.

Right now I am trying to become an ubuntu member :)
