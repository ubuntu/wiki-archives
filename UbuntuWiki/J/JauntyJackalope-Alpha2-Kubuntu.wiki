__TOC__



== Introduction ==
Jaunty Jackalope will in time become Kubuntu 9.04.

The focus for 9.04 for the Kubuntu community will be delivering a clean polished user friendly KDE4 Desktop. The plan is to continue migrating much of our existing Kubuntu software  to KDE4 offering a smooth out-of-the-gates KDE 4 interface. Jaunty is the first dazzling steps into the future of desktops with innovation not seen anywhere else.

Alpha 2, the second in a series of testing CD images that will be released throughout this cycle, represents the very latest snapshot of Jaunty Jackalope. The pre-release images are known to be reasonably free of major undocumented CD-build or installer bugs, however they are not recommended for use in stable environments. These releases will be for those who are developing, documenting, and testing. Alpha releases can be downloaded from the following URL:
* http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/releases/jaunty/alpha-2/

'''NOTE:''' ''This is an alpha (pre-) release. Pre-release versions of Jaunty are '''__NOT__''' encouraged for anyone needing a stable system or for anyone who is not comfortable running into occasional, even frequent, breakage. Pre-release versions of Jaunty '''__ARE__''' recommended for Kubuntu developers and those who want to help in testing, reporting, and fixing bugs.' Please do not use this in a production environment with data  or workflows that you cannot do without'

== New or Improved In Alpha 2 ==

Everything!!

The Jaunty Jackalope Alpha 2 CD release brings with it a brand new desktop as well as many new fixes and applications. For this latest release of Kubuntu 9.04, we are exploring some new changes . Besides these changes, there have been updates to many common applications as well as bug fixes to some of those annoyances you may or may not have run into. With every new pre-release, updates will be documented allowing you to thoroughly test your new Kubuntu test installation. Remember that all of these features are part of a pre-release version of Kubuntu, and may still have issues. We ask that any problems you come across that you file a bug, if one has yet to be filed for your problem.<<BR>>

*** Abilty to hide icons in the system tray as well as a new system wide notification framework

Applications

** Kmail has gone through some amazing work over and has gotten dressed up in new outfits to show off the sleek powerful physique. Any heavy user of mail is welcomed to try out this tool. For Alpha 2 Kmail is not on the CD but is readily available in the repository for use.
** Dolphin has a more streamlined interface that may hide some of it's more useful additional features like Ark integration, thumbnails on toolbars and Copy/Move Service menus. Don't miss out on them!
** Kate now has a vi input mode for all the people who like kate but love vi. Now you don't have to choose.

=== Powerdevil ===

Welcome the powerdevil manager which integrates nicely into krunner so that you can manage all your power settings easily both with the new streamlined GUI which takes over from Guidance Power Manager (still available for now in Universe if you would like it back) as well as with quick commands to suspend shutdown or reboot your computer as needed.

=== Known Issues ===

* Manual partitioning on Live CD installs is broken - Don't do it.
* OEM Install mode is broken on the Live CDs
* Amarok is still Amarok 1 (Getting Amarok 2 into Jaunty is planned, but depends on MySQL 5.1 getting in first)
* Amarok, Kmail, Kontact, and Konversation are not on the CD due to space constraints (They are all available through the standard repositories)
* No IRC client on the CD - Due to space constraints the plan is to have no KDE3 applications on the CD by release.  We are currently evaluating alternatives to Konversation since a KDE4 port of Konversation is not expected to be ready for Jaunty)
