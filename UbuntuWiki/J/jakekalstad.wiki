 Hello, My name is Jake Kalstad. I am a twenty-two year old software engineer from Eugene Oregon, working locally at FabTrol Systems to achieve the Steel Fabrication industries leading management software. 
I have grown up using Ubuntu and always wanted to contribute to the project and found an opportunity to join the Lubuntu team which has been quite the honor. 

This is the humble beginning of my wiki, it will grow greatly over the next few weeks!
