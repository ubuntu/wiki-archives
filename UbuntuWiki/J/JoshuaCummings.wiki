__TOC__

My name is Joshua Cummings and I'm an attempted free software developer and Unix addict living in NSW, Australia.

My contribution to free software has come in the form of bug reports, small patches, documentation and user support. I am a fan and user of the Debian GNU/kFreeBSD operating system, so I wrote an installation guide for it and occasionally try to maintain it. You can find it at http://glibc-bsd.alioth.debian.org/doc/

You can contact me in the following ways,

* Email: jrac at tsn dot cc
* Jabber: penix@jabber.org
* IRC: irc.freenode.net where I'm known as 'Penix'. I tend to lurk in #debian and #gnu-kbsd among other channels.
