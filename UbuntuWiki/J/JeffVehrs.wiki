== Me ==
I've been involved with computer ever since Apple ][, MSDOS 3.x and Win 3.x. When I first got exposed to the Unix(tm) world, FreeBSD(2.2.6) is my first "Unix" stuff to learn and play. Then, about in April 2005, Ubuntu 5.04 is my first Linux that I actually stayed with.

Whenever I get a new hardware, I ALWAYS installed BSD/Linux first and tried to break it to see how well BSD/Linux is designed. :)

Ubuntu r0cKs!
