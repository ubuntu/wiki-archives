__TOC__



== Introduction ==
Jaunty Jackalope will in time become Kubuntu 9.04.

The focus for 9.04 for the Kubuntu community will be delivering a clean polished user friendly KDE4 Desktop. The plan is to continue migrating much of our existing Kubuntu software  to KDE4 offering a smooth out-of-the-gates KDE 4 interface. Jaunty is the first dazzling steps into the future of desktops with innovation not seen anywhere else.

Alpha 3, the third in a series of testing CD images that will be released throughout this cycle, represents the very latest snapshot of Jaunty Jackalope. The pre-release images are known to be reasonably free of major undocumented CD-build or installer bugs, however they are not recommended for use in stable environments. These releases will be for those who are developing, documenting, and testing. Alpha releases can be downloaded from the following URL:
* http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/releases/jaunty/alpha-3/

'''NOTE:''' ''This is an alpha (pre-) release. Pre-release versions of Jaunty are '''__NOT__''' encouraged for anyone needing a stable system or for anyone who is not comfortable running into occasional, even frequent, breakage. Pre-release versions of Jaunty '''__ARE__''' recommended for Kubuntu developers and those who want to help in testing, reporting, and fixing bugs.' Please do not use this in a production environment with data  or workflows that you cannot do without'

== New or Improved In Alpha 3 ==

Everything!!

The Jaunty Jackalope Alpha 3 CD release brings with it a brand new desktop as well as many new fixes and applications. For this latest release of Kubuntu 9.04, we are exploring some new changes . Besides these changes, there have been updates to many common applications as well as bug fixes to some of those annoyances you may or may not have run into. With every new pre-release, updates will be documented allowing you to thoroughly test your new Kubuntu test installation. Remember that all of these features are part of a pre-release version of Kubuntu, and may still have issues. We ask that any problems you come across that you file a bug, if one has yet to be filed for your problem.<<BR>>

=== Quassel ===
Quassel is the new IRC client that the Kubuntu Team is trying out for the Jaunty release due to Konversation not being ported to KDE 4 in time. It is in the Universe repository so we ask that you install it, play around with it, break it, break it some more, and then file bugs on it.

=== Amarok 2 ===
Amarok 2 is currently sitting in the Universe repository, so please install it, test it, and let us know what you think by filing a bug, or two, or three, or...You get the idea.

=== Digikam 0.10.0 beta and KIPI Plugins 0.2.0 beta ===
KDE4 beta version of Digikam and KIPI-Plugins is available in Universe repository. Please install it and give it a try, as developers would like to fix any issues before final release that should be just ready for Jaunty.
More info:
* <nowiki>[[http://www.digikam.org/drupal/node/420|digiKam 0.10.0-beta8 announcement]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[http://www.digikam.org/drupal/node/419|Kipi-plugins 0.2.0-beta6 announcement]]</nowiki>

=== Welcoming back an old friend to the CD ISO ===
==== Kubuntu Documentation ====
We have decided to bring back Kubuntu Documentation in hope that people will look at KHelpCenter for Kubuntu documentation, and then flip out as they notice a bunch of KDE 3 information. This flipping out will hopefully lead them to help update Kubuntu Documentation.

If you are interested in helping out, please contact:
* <nowiki>[[RichardJohnson|Richard Johnson]]</nowiki>

=== Known Issues ===

* The amarok package has been updated to Amarok 2 for Alpha 3. Amarok 2 uses the mysql 5.1 embedded database for collection storage. These packages are not included on any Alpha 3 CD, but may be installed from the Ubuntu repository. For users of Kmail/Kontact, parts of the mysql 5.1 package conflict with parts of mysql 5.0 used by Akonadi, the Kmail/Kontact mail store. Amarok and Akonadi cannot be installed at the same time, so it is not currently possible to use both Kmail/Kontact and Amarok at the same time. Improvements in the packaging are in progress and this will be resolved in a later Alpha release.

* Place them here
