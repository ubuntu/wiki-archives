__TOC__

My name is Josh and I have done tech support for about a decade now, supporting everything from home user's virus-ridden computers to corporation's mission-critical servers.  I currently work with a VoIP company.

My launchpad link is https://launchpad.net/~mile357

I've run Ubuntu since 2006 on various computers, and currently run Xubuntu on an Acer Aspire One.

Since my particular netbook isn't yet represented in the laptop beta group I'm joining in order to help beta test the netbook edition of ubuntu.
