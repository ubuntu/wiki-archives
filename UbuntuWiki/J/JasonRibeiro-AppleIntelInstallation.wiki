This page aims to describe the steps needed to install Ubuntu on an Intel Mac computer.

== Introduction ==
It is recommended that you keep an install of OS X, even if you do not plan to use it in order to install firmware updates in the future that may be required for your Mac to operate properly.  If you are using a computer that does not have a cd-rom such as the Mac``Book Air, you should see the guide at FIXME.

FIXME: Recommended Ubuntu version to install

== OS X and Ubuntu dual boot ==
<nowiki>[[File:OSX.png]]</nowiki>  <nowiki>[[File:Linux.png]]</nowiki>
# Download <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download|Ubuntu Live CD]]</nowiki> and burn it
# Install <nowiki>[[http://refit.sourceforge.net/|rEFIt]]</nowiki> (this step is optional, you can hold 'Alt' to select partition everytime instead)
# Use Boot Camp Assistant (it's in Applications/Utilities on Leopard, OSX 10.5) to create new partition. Allocate whatever space you want for Ubuntu, given what you have free
## Alternatively, re-partitioning can be done from the command-line in OSX. Use '''diskutil resizevolume''' (check '''diskutil help''' for information)
# Insert the live CD into the drive and reboot
# Hold down ‘C’ button at the black screen to boot from CD
# Follow usual Ubuntu installation step. In keyboard selection screen, choose “macintosh”
# In partitioning screen, choose ‘manually edit partition table’
## Delete the Windows partition just created from Boot``Camp. Then create the ext3 partition at the same size. Mount it as ‘/’. Note where this partition is created (/dev/sdaX)
# On the last screen, click on the "Advanced" button and select instead /dev/sdaX (from previous step) in the drop-down list for installing GRUB (see picture below)
# Complete the installation process and reboot
# If you installed rEFIt, you have to activate it under OS X. Run enable.sh from the rEFIt installation. You can also choose to boot Linux first in the configuration file of rEFIt. Reboot. Choose the partition tool from rEFIt to sync the MBR with EFI. (If you don't have an english keyboard, note that the keys "Z" and "Y" are swaped in the partition tool)

== Triple Boot Methods ==

=== Ubuntu, OS X, & Vista (Boot Camp with rEFIt) ===

<nowiki>[[File:OSX.png]]</nowiki>  <nowiki>[[File:Vista.png]]</nowiki>  <nowiki>[[File:Linux.png]]</nowiki>

# Assuming that OS X is installed, use bootcamp to install Windows XP or Vista. NOTE: MAKE ENOUGH SPACE FOR BOTH WINDOWS AND UBUNTU WITH BOOT CAMP!
# Install windows normally.
# Start your computer with the Ubuntu disk in the drive. Install Ubuntu by partitioning the boot camp drive that Windows is located on, and install both Ubuntu and GRUB bootloader onto the new partition. (If you want more compatibility with mac, format to ex2, not ex3. There are programs that allow mac to write to that)
# Start the computer and boot back into Mac and install rEFIt. This will allow you to boot into every operating system on boot.

=== Ubuntu, OS X, & Vista (rEFIt without Boot Camp) ===

<nowiki>[[File:OSX.png]]</nowiki>  <nowiki>[[File:Vista.png]]</nowiki>  <nowiki>[[File:Linux.png]]</nowiki>

# Startup your laptop with Ubuntu Desktop CD inserted into the drive.
# In rEFIt menu, choose to boot the Ubuntu CD.
# Select English as the language to be used.
# Select the 2nd option, the one that says : "Install Ubuntu"
# After the loading, on the install screen, select the O.S. Language (English) and hit "Forward" button, then  select your country location.
# On the Keyboard layout, choose your keyboard language, and on the other window select the variant Macintosh (mine is Portugal - Macintosh), and test the typing if you want.
# On the "Prepare Disk Space" menu, select the 1st option: "Guided - Resize SCSI3 (0,1,0), Partition #3 (sda) and use Free Space", and with your mouse select the desired partition size (I set mine to 80% Windows Vista & 20% Ubuntu), and hit "Forward" button.
# On "Migrate Documents and Settings" menu, just hit "Forward".
# On "Ready to Install" menu, select "Advanced..." and select to install Grub boot loader to the last partition "/dev/sda4" and hit "OK" button, and then hit "Install" button to begin the installation process.
# After the installation as finished, hit "Restart Now" button, it will exit the installer and eject your CDROM, then press "Enter" key to restart. After the reboot, select the Linux icon on rEFIt to boot into Ubuntu.
# Don't forget not to install the ATI accelerated graphics drivers, that is auto-detected by Hardware Drivers application, we'll cover the installation of the latest and official ATI drivers on the next section.
# Go to 'System' > 'Administration' > 'Software Sources' and check all boxes on the "Third party software", and also on the "Updates" tab. Then hit "Close" button to reload the sources.
# Go to 'System' > 'Administration' > 'Update Manager' and check and install the new updates.

=== Ubuntu, OS X, & Vista (Boot Camp without rEFIt) ===

<nowiki>[[File:OSX.png]]</nowiki>  <nowiki>[[File:Vista.png]]</nowiki>  <nowiki>[[File:Linux.png]]</nowiki>

# Make sure you use Leopard and have it updated (10.5.2).
# Start Boot``Camp and create a partition for Windows XP (15G is enough).
# Don't install it through Bootcamp.
# Insert Windows CD and reboot holding C when you hear the beeping sound.
# Windows installation should start, follow the usual installation process of Windows.
# If it reboots during installation, you press ALT during reboot so that you can pick Windows installation.
# After Windows is installed, insert your Leopard DVD and it should install all your Apple drivers and stuff.
# Update your Apple Software (there will be an option on the start menu to do so).
# Update Windows XP.

=== Ubuntu, OS X, & Windows XP (Triple Boot with rEFIt) ===

<nowiki>[[File:OSX.png]]</nowiki>  <nowiki>[[File:Vista.png]]</nowiki>  <nowiki>[[File:Linux.png]]</nowiki>

# Now that Windows is installed, get back to MacOS, we are going to install Linux now.
# Start Disk Utility and create a new partition on Machintosh HD, name it Linux
# Insert Linux CD and reboot holding C
# On Linux installation, delete the partition you created (Linux) because its HFS, and set it as ext3 and mount /. Don't need to create swap (I know its going to warn you, but ignore it).
# At the last step of setup, click advanced because you need to change where GRUB is going to be installed, choose sdaX (which X is your Linux partition).
# Let it install Ubuntu.
# Get back to MacOS, install rEFIt, reboot and run the partition manager of rEFIt, which should take care of every detail of booting for each OS.
# Reboot and that's it.

== Troubleshooting ==
# In case you are stuck with a "No bootable device" message or a blank screen, reboot and select the Partitioning Tool in rEFIt and let it update the MBR
# If you did not install rEFIt, hold down Alt/Option to choose whether to boot into OSX / Ubuntu. The Boot Camp-installed boot menu will recognize the Ubuntu installation as "Windows," but will boot Ubuntu normally regardless
# Note on a bug that prevents booting after a successful install (a blank screen or blinking cursor) can be found <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Intel_iMac#NOTE%20ON%20INSTALLATION%20BUG|here]]</nowiki>
