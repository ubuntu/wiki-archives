=== About Me ===
My name is Josh Ellis, and I have been working with Ubuntu since Edgy. I've been helping and getting help in #ubuntu, #ubuntu-server and #ubuntu-us-mn on IRC for a while now. I joined the Minnesota LoCo team in January of 2008 and the Ubuntu Server Team in November of 2008. I also test/enjoy packages from the backports repositories.
