==== Linux Experience ====
I started using Linux in 2002.  At the time I started with Debian 'potato' in 2002 and ended with 'etch'.  Moved to Ubuntu for desktop use around 'Hoary' and am currently running 'Feisty' on 3 machines including a Motion Computing's tablet PC LS800.   I have used Linux for backup solutions with BackupPC and firewall/ VPN server with shorewall, freeswan, and Debian.

==== IT Experience ====
I have been working with Healthcare Facilities since 2000.  I have some experience with HL7 interfaces.  I am a systems analyst with 4 other team members for 20 Windows servers and 450 desktop computers.  I still need to use Windows for administration but use Linux tools for networking and scripting.
