==== About Me ====

I first ran across Ubuntu during the transition from 10.04 to 10.10, and have been in love with it ever since.  I have really enjoyed shifting my work from MSWindows to Linux.  I have this account so that I can report bugs and provide hardware testing for my machine.  That's about it.  Oh, and I am studying Geography and Geosciences, but probably spend too much time fooling around with F/OSS instead of my school work.    

==== Why I'm here ====

You can find my laptop tests <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/Laptop/Reports/ToshibaSatelliteL500|here]]</nowiki>.  I'm open to any suggestions, thanks!

==== Contact Info ====

You can reach me at my <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~roberts-jp80|Launchpad account]]</nowiki> where you can find out a little more about me!  

If you need to contact me, I really only speak English, but I do know a little Spanish.
