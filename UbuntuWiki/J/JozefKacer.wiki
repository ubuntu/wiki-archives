==== Hello World! ====

Hi, I'm Jozef Kacer aka q-parser. I've been studying English and Computer Science at University in Slovakia. 

Though being a fan of other popular Linux distro I've taken a chance to help out the Ubuntu community with translation of this cute Linux flavor into Slovak, thus allowing people here to get in contact with penguins:) I participated on translation of php documentation, however there were very few of us and project soon fell into oblivion leaving a vast sources to be translated. It would be discouraging for me if the same happened here, however I hope that people participating on Slovak translation are not here just due to their prestige :P
