=== Summary ===

Creative Commons license provide content creators a straight forward way to communicate to the world what rights they wish to enforce on their work. There are a variety of licenses that range from Attribution (the most open) only to Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives (the most restrictive). See: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/

We aim to give Free/Open Source Software users the ability to both assign licenses to newly created works (eg in GIMP, OpenOffice, F-Spot) and the ability to view licenses in downloaded content (eg in Banshee, Totem, Evince). This involves making modifications to various upstream applications and thus requires broad community support.

=== Release Note ===

Giving the user complete freedom does not end at the software they run but also the content they create with that software.  By giving the user the ability to assign and embed the license of their choice into the works they create we are extending that freedom even more.

=== Rationale ===

See Release Note.

=== Use Cases ===

=== Assumptions ===

=== Design ===

=== Implementation ===

==== UI Changes ====

==== Code Changes ====

=== Test/Demo Plan ===

It's important that we are able to test new features, and demonstrate them to users.  Use this section to describe a short plan that anybody can follow that demonstrates the feature is working.  This can then be used during testing, and to show off after release. Please add an entry to http://testcases.qa.ubuntu.com/Coverage/NewFeatures for tracking test coverage.

This need not be added or completed until the specification is nearing beta.

=== Unresolved issues ===

This should highlight any issues that should be addressed in further specifications, and not problems with the specification itself; since any specification with problems cannot be approved.  Note that the Non-Commericial and No-Derivatives licenses are not suitable for the main archive.

=== BoF agenda and discussion ===

Use this section to take notes during the BoF; if you keep it in the approved spec, use it for summarising what was discussed and note any options that were rejected.
