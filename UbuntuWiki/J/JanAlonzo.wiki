Brief Bio

Hi, I'm Jan Alonzo and I live in the central coast of NSW, Australia. I'm currently the maintainer of Straw feed aggregator and Tagalog (filipino) dictionaries for Aspell and Ispell. I also maintain Debian packages for pmock and the tagalog aspell/ispell dictionary packages.

I started using Ubuntu last April 2005 during the UbuntuDownUnder conf. I really loved the integration and everything (mostly, except for hibernate) works on my old laptop (T20). 

One of the reasons why I moved to Ubuntu from Debian is because of the low-barrier to entry and fast-paced development of the distro, which is encouraging not only for current developers but also for would-be contributors.

My goals at the moment are:

* find my niche in the community.
* Help out MOTU to get universe in shape for breezy.
* Get involve with ubuntu-ph.
* Reporting bugs.
