I'm currently studying Computer Systems Engineering and Economics at the <nowiki>[[http://www.adelaide.edu.au|University of Adelaide]]</nowiki>, Australia.

I've been playing around with linux for around 10 years, and have used Ubuntu exclusively on my desktop since installing it mid 2005. I also dualboot Ubuntu/WinXP/OSX on my LGElectronicsLW40-BTZA laptop, with Ubuntu being my main OS.

I am an active member of AustralianTeam, the Australian Ubuntu Local Community Team.

I created the <nowiki>[[http://ubuntu.com.au/meeting-prefs/|meeting scheduler]]</nowiki>, currently used on ubuntu.com.au to decide what day to have our LoCo meetings.

I can be reached at joel.stan@gmail.com, and I frequent #ubuntu-au on freenode.
