==== About Me ====
My name is Juan V. Guerrero I work for a telco company in Panama City Panama, my everyday work involves software development for the Unix platform, I've been involved with software development since 1992.

==== Skills ====
I've worked with the following programming languages C/C++, JAVA, PHP, Mono/C#, a little python and shell (bash) scripting. The language I love the most is C.
Gtk+/Gtk#/GNOME application programming.
Client/Server apps with sockets and and web (HTTP protocol) interfacing.
At work one of my biggest projects was to develop a tool to store all our telco network devices (switches, routers, sensors, etc.) configurations in a huge database with support for versioning and a dual GUI (Gtk+/Web) administration console as well this interface should be able to deploy a previusly saved configutration version to the equipment safely.
I'm also involved with the VoIP world but not yet as a developer.
