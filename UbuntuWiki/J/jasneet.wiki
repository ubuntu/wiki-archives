Hi, my name is Jasneet and I'm a Final Year student of Computer Science Engineering in a prominent institute of New Delhi. I recently started using Ubuntu.

My main OS of use till date was Arch Linux but I have recently shifted to Ubuntu 10.10 and have also installed Ubuntu 11.04 Alpha 2 on my PC for testing purposes.

I also run a laptop which has Intel Core i7 1.6GHz Processor with Intel P55 Chipset, 4GHz 1300MHz DDR3 RAM, ATI HD4670 GPU.
