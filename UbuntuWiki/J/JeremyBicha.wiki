=== Who I Am ===
I am a United States Navy Veteran and spent 2007-2010 living in Bahrain. I currently live in Florida. I joined Canonical in 2022 but my Ubuntu story started much earlier.

=== My Ubuntu Story ===
I started using Linux when Ubuntu 6.06 "Dapper Drake" was released.

My first packaging change to land in Ubuntu was just before 9.10 Karmic was released to get Moodle to work for Edubuntu.

I got significantly involved in Ubuntu near the end of the 11.04 Natty cycle because I saw there was a big need for help with the Unity/GNOME3 transition. I helped package GNOME3 for the GNOME3 PPAs. The review process felt easier as it was just a PPA. I got more experience with submitting merge proposals (MPs) and working on a variety of packages. As 11.10 Oneiric opened for GNOME 3, I started submitting my work for merging directly into the main archive and officially joined the '''Desktop Team''' later that summer.

I got involved with ubuntu-docs about the same way near the end of the 11.04 Natty cycle. The ubuntu-docs package had been synced from a still-incomplete snapshot of the GNOME docs which described GNOME Shell, not Unity. I did most of the work to get that usable for release. I remained part of the '''Docs Team''' for the next year or two.

I later started <nowiki>[[https://ubuntugnome.org/|Ubuntu GNOME]]</nowiki> with a lot of help from <nowiki>[[TimLunn|darkxst]]</nowiki>. The first release was 12.10 and the first release as an official flavor was 13.04. Ubuntu GNOME became obsolete when Ubuntu's flagship desktop product switched back to GNOME in 2017.

I've used my skills outside GNOME packaging and became a <nowiki>[[MOTU]]</nowiki> in 2012 and a <nowiki>[[Core Dev]]</nowiki> in 2017.

I served one term on the <nowiki>[[DeveloperMembershipBoard|Developer Membership Board]]</nowiki>.

I currently maintain traditional (.deb) packages and do related integration work for the <nowiki>[[DesktopTeam|Desktop Team]]</nowiki>.
 
=== Why You Might Vote for Me for the Technical Board ===
I nominate myself to serve on the <nowiki>[[TechnicalBoard|Technical Board]]</nowiki> (TB).

I believe my background as a former lead for a community desktop flavor of Ubuntu is helpful perspective.

I am a Debian Developer. Becoming a Debian Developer requires a fairly solid understanding of Debian policies and procedures. These policies are the foundation that Ubuntu was built on and are still very relevant.
