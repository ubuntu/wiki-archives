=== Indicator Weather ===

Introduction: http://www.webupd8.org/2010/07/install-weather-indicator-applet-with.html

Launchpad project: https://launchpad.net/weather-indicator

Bugs: https://bugs.launchpad.net/weather-indicator

PPA: '''ppa:weather-indicator-team/ppa'''

Package Name: '''indicator-weather'''

<nowiki>[[File:cloudy.png|cloudy screenshot]]</nowiki> 

==== Idea ====
Natty Narwhal doesn't support the Gnome Weather applet, so an indicator replacement is required.  Enter: indicator-weather.

==== Features ====
* Shows the current weather conditions and temperature in the panel
* Shows more information about the current weather in the indicator's menu
* Optionally shows weather conditions and temperatures at several other locations
* Three levels of notification - none, on weather change, on severe condition weather change

==== PPA ====
indicator-weather is available from the Ubuntu repositories.  But the version in the repositories is not updated very often.  To get the latest features and bugfixes, add our stable PPA:  '''ppa:weather-indicator-team/ppa''' .  More details about the PPA are <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~weather-indicator-team/+archive/ppa|available here]]</nowiki>.

Known regressions with PPA version:
* None

Differences between PPA (11.05.31) and Ubuntu repo (11.04.10+repack-0ubuntu2):
* Using dconf to store settings instead of desktopcouch - less crashes, no excessive CPU usage
* Fixed bug preventing some users from adding their cities
* Fixed forecast and Google icons
* Fix for incorrect sunrise/sunset in some locations (requires manually deleting and re-adding affected locations)

==== Coming Features ====
Right now, we're working on moving from pure Python to a Python/Vala combination, which will allow the indicator to have a very swish menu.

When this lands, it will bring:
* Configurable menu - see only the info you want to see
* "Feels like" temperatures - Heat Index, Wind Chill, Humidex and Apparent Temperature
* Guess your location
* 3 day forecasts in the menu

In the long-term forecast:
* Use Weather Underground data
* Show radar maps

To request a new feature that's not on this list, you can <nowiki>[[https://blueprints.launchpad.net/weather-indicator|register a blueprint]]</nowiki>, or simply hit us up on <nowiki>[[https://twitter.com/IndicatrWeather|Twitter]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[https://www.facebook.com/pages/Indicator-Weather/160650143999010|Facebook]]</nowiki> or <nowiki>[[https://identi.ca/indicatorweather|identi.ca]]</nowiki>.

==== Implementation ====
Weather Indicator uses the Indicator framework and Python. Weather data is obtained from Yahoo or Google, and the Google Weather API is used for forecasts.
