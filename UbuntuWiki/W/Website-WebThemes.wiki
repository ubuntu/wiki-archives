== Website Themes for Community Use ==

=== Who should use these ===

This webpage includes information relevant to the Ubuntu Web Presence Team and official Local Communities. Here you'll find resources to build up a loco website or other useful community web services.

If you plan to use listed resources in other ways than described above, please remove the branding parts.

To follow this team progress, please subscribe to <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/Ubuntu-website|mailing list]]</nowiki>.

=== What we need ===

Currently a team of community volunteers is being created. Those people will create teams to work for supporting web resources across a list of software packages like CMS and bulletin boards.

=== Code Hosting ===

Three Bzr Branches have been created for the development of the new community themes. There is a branch for the base theme (lp:ubuntu-website/light-base-theme). After the theme in this branch has been agreed upon, work will begin on the Word``Press (lp:ubuntu-website/light-wordpress-theme) and Drupal (lp:ubuntu-website/light-drupal-theme) basing them on the base theme.

==== Base theme ====
Goal: Create a plain HTML/CSS file that can serve as a basis for the other themes, ideally even sharing the CSS and images created for this theme. This theme may be translated into many different human languages and be implemented in several different CMSs.

Bzr Branch: lp:ubuntu-website/light-base-theme

'''Updated Web Guidelines (14th Oct)'''
Hello, here are some updated web guidelines from Alejandra:

* <nowiki>[[attachment:global_fat_footer.png]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[attachment:wiki_global_header_and_footer.png]]</nowiki>

The previous guidelines we were using were not designed with community sites in mind, they were more for sites that should provide a seemless experience to ubuntu.com. These guidelines attached are for use across all of the sites in the Ubuntu ecosystem and features 

* A global "mothership" navigation directing people back to ubuntu.com if they're looking for it
* A logo that gives clear context of the current site and links to the current site's homepage
* Room for a site-specific navigation that won't confuse people as they switch from site to site
* A dual-layered fat footer, one for the current site's mini site map and a small one (the bottom portion) linking the site back to the main ubuntu.com site.

'''People working on this theme:'''

* <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~sushkov|Stas Sușcov]]</nowiki> (you may count on me for xHTML/CSS work)
* <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~kuzeko|KuZeKo]]</nowiki> (you may count on me for HTML5/CSS with progressive enhancement and a little of jQuery)
* <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~handheld-car|handheldcar]]</nowiki> (you may count on me for HTML5, CSS and maybe some Java``Script)
* List your names here

==== Drupal theme ====

Goal: Adapt the Base theme for use as a drupal module

Bzr Branch: lp:ubuntu-website/light-drupal-theme

'''People working on this theme:'''

* <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~mongolito404|Pierre Buyle]]</nowiki> (count on me for basic HTML/CSS, Java``Script, jQuery, Drupal's theme layer and Drupal's APIs)
* List your names here

==== WordPress theme ====

Goal: Adapt the Base theme for use with Word``Press, write documentation on how to deploy a multi-language loco-website and maintain the plugins it will require.

Bzr Branch: lp:ubuntu-website/light-wordpress-theme

'''People working on this theme:'''

* <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~sushkov|Stas Sușcov]]</nowiki> (initiator of wordpress-loco and currently GSoC student at Word``Press)
* <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~adnane002|Adnane Belmadiaf]]</nowiki> (count on me for HTML/CSS, Java``Script, jQuery)
* List your names here

===== The Fridge =====

(added per newz2000 suggestion by <nowiki>[[AmberGraner | akgraner]]</nowiki>)

Here are the changes to the mock-up for the new (Word Press) Fridge these changes are based on  - http://ubuntu.kuzeko.com/

Not sure we need the picture area all the time but it would be nice to have if we can mange to have a pic with each story or even an Ubuntu Photo of thew week.. or something

Since we want the Fridge to be the information radiator of the community and link to all areas in the community as well as link to the offical news in the community then we need a lot of changes

I am not a web designer so if these would make sense arranged some other please do so.

* '''To the left of "Page 1"''' in the red/orange header area should be Fridge Logo.  (We need an updated one to match the new theme.  I've asked doctormo if he or someone he knows could create one but haven't heard back yet. - I'll email him this week)

* '''Page 1'''  -  link Ubuntu Weekly News Letter (new page)
(Would like this to be the page where we can put the full version of the Newsletter in HMTL format and we can make it search able)

* '''Page 2''' - Link to Ubuntu.com - http://www.ubuntu.com/ - More about Ubuntu

* '''Page 3''' - Link to Canonical.com - http://www.canonical.com/ - More about Canonical

* '''Page 4''' - Link to Lo``Co Team Wiki Pages - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LoCoTeams - Ubuntu LoCo Information

* '''Page 5''' - Link to Release Schedule Wiki - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MaverickReleaseSchedule  - Current Release Schedule
(not sure if there is a redirect page that will be set to link to Current Release Schedule.  If there isn't then at the end of each cycle we'll need to change the link)

* '''Sub``Item 1''' - Fridge Calendar - <iframe src="http://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=j5q85mmi6ujvjtii5s1n3li5io%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/New_York" style="border: 0" width="800" height="600" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>

* '''Sub``Item 2''' - Classroom Calendar - <iframe src="http://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=canonical.com_qg6t4s8i7mg8d4lgfu9f93qid4%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/New_York" style="border: 0" width="800" height="600" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>

* '''Sub``Item 3''' - Lo``Co Calendar - <iframe src="http://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=cnkg44crsf9qpnr918snkaidf8%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/New_York" style="border: 0" width="800" height="600" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>

* '''Sub``Item 4''' - FOSS``Events Calendar - http://fossevents.org/?ec3_days=60 - Upcoming FOSS Events

* '''Sub``Item 5''' - Can we change this to a bright Red/Orange Tab with the new Circle of Friends Logo and make this say SUBMIT NEWS STORY OR IDEA HERE? and this would email the story to UWN/FRIDGE Team but not the current mailing list. I would like to create a new mailing list that goes to the active Fridge and UWN editors this way people won't feel like their ideas are being seen by everyone and they are more comfortable.  Many people don't send stories to the list but send them straight to me.  I would like to encourage people to send to a "Contribute Here area"  I can talk to jcasto and get that created as well.  I also have a webform for this too.  Either one will be fine with me please tell me what you think. Other ideas welcome, but people need to have a place were they can contribute without feeling embarrassed if story ideas are rejected.
