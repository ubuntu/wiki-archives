== Introduction ==

Reporting a problem with debian installer can be frustrating as the `ubuntu-bug` command is not available in the limited Busybox session.

== How to file a bug ==

A failed installer will usually flash a red screen saying it has failed. Press the 'go back' button until you get to a menu that has an option to save debug logs. Choosing that option will provide an IP address that an embedded web server will use to offer the debug files. From a networked computer, or even the host if it is a virtual machine, download the debug files by running `wget -r` on the IP address.

From this computer open a web browser and log in to https://launchpad.net and go to https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/debian-installer and press the report bug button. Enter your bug report and attach all the saved debug logs, archived (with `tar`) so as to attach everything via a single comment. 

== Bug tags ==

Bug tags specific to the package or area should be included here for reporters so they can tag their bug report.  It will also be useful for triagers.  The Bugs/Tags wiki page should then be modified to include these tags.

== Debugging procedure ==

In depth debugging procedures for this particular package or subsystem.  This usually is information about the log files to gather and what to look for in them.

== How to Triage ==

Information that will facilitate the triaging of bugs for this package or subsystem.  Remind triagers of the bug tags in use for this particular package.

=== Stock Reply ===

A stock reply to be used for initial bug reports basically asking for the stuff in "How to file".  The Bugs/Responses page should include this reply.

=== How to Forward ===

In the event that the package or subsystem has an upstream bug tracker this section should contain detailed steps to forward a bug to that tracker.  Some packages may just link to the general "How to Forward" page for another bug tracker like Gnome's bugzilla or freedesktop.org's bug tracker.

== Known bugs ==

Description of known bug reports that may receive duplicates and how to recognise them.  This information should be obtained by looking for bugs tagged as 'metabug'.
