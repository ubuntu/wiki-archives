wineasio is an <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_stream_input_output|ASIO]]</nowiki> driver for <nowiki>[[Wine]]</nowiki>.

Due to licensing restrictions regarding the ASIO source, <nowiki>[[http://people.jacklab.net/edogawa/files/wineasio/|wineasio]]</nowiki> cannot be distributed as a binary.  The source is maintained by the <nowiki>[[http://www.jacklab.net/|JackLab]]</nowiki> project.

There's an <nowiki>[[http://www.davehayes.org/2007/04/27/howto-reaper-on-ubuntu-linux-with-wineasio/|article by Dave Hayes]]</nowiki> that explains how to install from source on Ubuntu.  Pick the latest version of the wineasio tarball, don't select the "JACK driver" in WineCfg if it appears (it shouldn't!).
