__TOC__

This Web page and it's associated Web pages are written to 
help Windows users migrate to Ubuntu Linux that
is distributed, free, by Canonical, a company in South Africa.

The information herein is geared towards those
who are unfamiliar with Ubuntu Linux and, with Windows to Linux Migration
in general.

There is lots of information on the Web about migrating to Linux
from Windows but few appear to be directed towards a particular
Linux Distribution.

Also there appears to be a very little comparison
information which would help perspective Linux users decide if
Linux is something they can migrate to and forget Windows.

This Web page will strive to provide all the information necessary
to allow Windows users to decide if they can migrate to Linux
and either leave Windows behind, or, add Linux as an alternative
OS and dual boot their machine into either Windows or Linux.
