== Why is it taking so long for my files to sync? ==
If you are uploading many files and folders (100's) it will take a while for files to sync. You will likely see empty folders in the web UI while Ubuntu One works on uploading the files. This is a known performance issue that we have plans to fix in Ubuntu 11.04 (Natty).
