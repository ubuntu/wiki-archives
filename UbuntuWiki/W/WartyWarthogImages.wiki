__TOC__

== Warty Images ==

Our theme for Warty (and Ubuntu) is "human". We want an art photography feel to the desktop, with human images wherever possible. We have discussed, for example, a desktop image that is updated monthly, much like a calendar would be. The idea is "benetton with more art", very different from the typical computing metaphor of bright colours and plastic looks.

=== ISOLINUX Boot Splash ===

* Max 16 colours
* MAX 639x479, however should really be around 639x320ish
* eventually gets converted to lss or rle, but png is fine

This is what the user sees when they first pop in the CD and boot off it (both liveCD and install CD).  This should be simple, but effectively state who we are.

=== GRUB Boot Splash ===

* 14 colours exactly.
* 640x480 exactly.
* Must be xpm format

When the system first boots it runs a piece of software called GRUB, which offers the user a list of available operating systems on the computer. It is possible to display that list on a screen overlaying an image. The image has a number of contraints. First, it should have no more than 16 colours, and be 640x480 in size. Second, the text falls within a specific area of the screen, so this should be free of any clutter in the image (that area should be a plain colour, preferably black).

BTW, the above may change with GRUB 2 (in the fairly near future).  I'm pretty sure they are trying to get higher resolutions/colors.

Below is an example. A transparent menu will sit on top of this, so it should be pretty plain.  Our logo/name should be somewhere on the bottom portion of the screen to avoid confusion (similar to example).

Here is the xpm format:

Here is a jpg (converted) format:

<nowiki>[[File:grub-splash.jpg]]</nowiki>

After a bit of time trying to get these images to work, I discovered that the image must be exactly 14 colors not 16.  I'm pretty sure grub2 should fix all this.

=== Kernel Boot Splash ===

* 16 bit RGB colours
* Several sizes needed: 1600x1200, 1280x1024, 1024x786, 800x600, and 640x480
* JPG format (animations in MNG format)

GRUB hands control to the selected operating system. If they choose Warty, then the kernel will show a boot splash screen on top of which they might see messages scrolling by.

The images are not really limited in size or color (technically).  However, we are limited to what people's hardware supports.  Basically we should provide several different resolutions and (possibly) color depths.  For the best coverage, color depth should be set at 16bit.  Optionally, we could also provide 24bit, but some hardware doesn't support it and 16bit is fine for most people.

There is also one more thing.  We need two seperate images: silent and verbose.  The silent image is what is shown when we are hiding the text.  The verbose image is for when the users presses F2 to see the boot messages, the verbose image is displayed in the background (behind the text).

Here is a (very) rough idea of the silent image (the globe which is missing in this picture will rotate behind the text):

<nowiki>[[File:logo-silent-800x600.png]]</nowiki>

Here is a (very) rough idea of the verbose image (text will appear in the black box):

<nowiki>[[File:logo-verbose-800x600.png]]</nowiki>

On top of the actual picure will be either a progress bar or an animation (or both).  Animations must be in mng format.

=== GDM Login Screen ===

* RGB colours
* JPG or PNG format
* 1600x1200

Once the boot process is complete, the graphical ("windows") environment is started, and the user is presented with a login screen. This is where we have the opportunity to use many (millions) of colours, and higher resolution. The user is presented with a login box for username and password, so the image needs to be carefully created to fit in with that.

GDM automatically sizes the background image.  The theme is also sized accordingly.

Below is what an actual GDM screen would look like (the items can be moved anywhere to accomodate the backdrop)

=== Gnome Splash Screen ===

* RGB colours
* JPG or PNG format
* ~450x300 (this can vary)
* It should have a small "channel" on the bottom for icons to appear across. (see example)

After the user logs in, they will see the Gnome splash screen while their desktop is setup. This small image needs space for a series of icons that appear along the bottom of it as pieces of the desktop software system are initialised.

Here is a mockup of what the splash screen looks like during actual boot process.  the icons scroll across from left to right.  The text related to the rightmost icon is displaid underneath:

=== Default Desktop Background ===

* RGB colours
* JPG or PNG format
* We should have two basic sizes 1600x1200 (standard) and 1440x900 (widescreen) and have gnome scale the image
** i propose you bump the widescreen one to at least 1680x1050 (or 1920x1200) because upscaling is no pretty, and if you're able to produce 1600x1200 you should be able to produce one of these two.. i hope :) ofc this is just because i happen to use 1680x1050 -- CarlJohanCrafoord

When a user logs in, they will see their desktop. The default image here will again be in many colours.

NOTE: We need TWO images here, one for the default desktop in the LiveCD and one for the default desktop of the InstallCD. These images will both have the same themese: human beings, art photography, muted colours, interesting pose. The LiveCD will be racier. We won't go topless, but the LiveCD will nonetheless be aimed at a young male audience, with a female subject. The InstallCD will have a more conservative default desktop image, but the same colour scheme.

=== Default Theme ===

Ubuntu will allow the user to change the colours of menus, window borders and other decoration. The default theme will be a modified version of the Industrial theme, using softer colours that blend well with the "art photography" feel. NathanielMcCallum is working on this theme, and can collaborate with the design team to get the colours working well with the art photography.
