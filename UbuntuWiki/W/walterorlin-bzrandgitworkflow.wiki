Describe walterorlin/bzrandgitworkflow here.
Thanks to wxl for explaining this well in irc. 
 < wxl> the way to contribute to a repo that works for everyone regardless of there access to a repo is:
 
 <wxl>1. branch the code

 <wxl>  2. make changes

 < wxl> 3. push the code to your repo

 < wxl> 4. request a review

 < wxl> 5. upon successful review, code is merged from your repo to the main repo

 < wxl> in github, it's actually very simple:

 < wxl> 1. fork the code

 < wxl> 2. make changes

 < wxl> 3. push the code to your fork

 < wxl> 4. issue a pull request

 < wxl> 5. upon approved request, code is merged from your fork to the main repo
