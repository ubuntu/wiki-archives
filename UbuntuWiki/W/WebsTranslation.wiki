=== Summary ===
Webs Translation - Start the process of translating and localizing the Canonical/Ubuntu web services (Ubuntu web page, Launchpad...) into another languages.

=== Rationale ===
If we make Canonical/Ubuntu services available to more people on the internet, we can reach a broader audience. Translation is already available for Ubuntu programs, but not currently for the website.
=== Use cases ===

=== Scope ===
Ubuntu web page, Launchpad site
=== Design ===
Could we somehow use Rosetta for translation, since it's already available?

=== Implementation ===

==== Code ====

==== Data preservation and migration ====

=== Outstanding issues ===

=== BoF agenda and discussion ===
