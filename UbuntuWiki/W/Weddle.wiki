=== About Me ===

A long term network and Linux geek, I work as a sales engineer for Cisco by day. I don't code often anymore, but at one time or another I've done work in C++, Java, Perl, Gofer/Haskell, and Prolog. More recently, I hack Python occasionally for fun, and have picked up a little bit of R. I have a dusty M.S. in Computational Biosciences, and I've previously held a number of technology certifications including CCNP, CCDP, CCNA, CCDA, CISSP, and currently hold CMNA, CWTS, and Acano ACE (#104).

I got started with Linux first on Slackware and then Redhat in the mid 90s, and explored a number of distros before settling down with Ubuntu as my primary distribution in the mid-late 2000s.
