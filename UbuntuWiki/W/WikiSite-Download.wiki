| The download area is on a different server. That's why when you will go there, the site will look completely different from this site. Never mind, it's the official <nowiki>[[http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/edubuntu/releases/9.04/release/|download site]]</nowiki>. There is also a page on our official website, that has more information on which downloads are best suited for you. That site also looks different! We're working on that. For now, just go to <nowiki>[[http://www.edubuntu.org/Download|our official download page]]</nowiki>.

We are always looking for developers, translators, artists and people that write documentation. But it's okay to just browse this site and use what you need. For official documentation, go to help.ubuntu.com
