<nowiki>[[http://weudelon.com|Weudel On]]</nowiki> is committed to bringing Open-Source Technology to Everyday People. 

My goal is to help make Ubuntu and other Open Source software more accessible by finding the most user-friendly hardware and software solutions available.  I won’t be posting large segments of code or 50-step how-tos to tell you how to get stuff working.  I will be seeking out the easiest and most user-friendly way to make things “just work” with Ubuntu.
