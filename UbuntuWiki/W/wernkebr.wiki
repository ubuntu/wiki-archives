== About me ==

  My name is Brandon Wernke.  I have a strong interest in development but find my interests unmet in my daily life.  So, I am going to get involved with Ubuntu, my favorite OS (closely followed by Arch Linux), to try to meet my desire to '''''code'''''.
 
  I have coding experience in Java, but have no official training.  I have been a user of Ubuntu for a very long time, since high school sometime.  I have bounced around in distributions but have found Ubuntu to be one of the better Linux distros, so have decided to stick with it.  I haven't the time to go to school, but I do my best to learn on my own.

=== Goals ===

  I hope to find employment doing what I love best - coding - at some point in the future.  
  Develop something lasting and worthwhile for the world.
