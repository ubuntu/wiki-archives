Simply put, Ubuntu Linux is a Linux Distribution created by the folks
at Canonical, in South Africa.

Most Linux distributions use the Linux Kernel as the
base operating system.  The creation and maintenance of 
the Linux Kernel is  handled by the Linux Kernel Group ???

There are literally 30 to 40 Linux distributions but Ubuntu
has been (and continues to be) the  top distribution for the last 2 to 3 years.
Basically the folks at Canonical package the Linux Kernel
and a lot of other Linux programs into a package that
can be installed on various flavors of computer hardware.

Ubuntu Linux is the name most often associated with 
Canonical's Linux Distribution but there are actuality several
flavors that are created by Canonical, such as
* Ubuntu
* Kubuntu
* Xubuntu
* Edubuntu

Ubuntu, Kubuntu and Xubuntu derive their names from the
Desktop Windows Management software they use.

Those familiar with MS Windows know there is only one
Desktop Presentation. That is, there is one graphical
Interface provided with a Windows installation and that
graphical interface is fixed and controlled by the MS Developers.

However, Ubuntu Linux allows you to have several different Desktop
Presentation flavors, such as:
* Gnome
* Kde
* Xcfe

The above Desktop Interfaces are not created by Canonical
but are actually products in their own right. However, most of
the Linux Distributions use the X Windows System (created 
at MIT) as the base Windows Management System. X Windows
is produced by the Xorg folks and is a product in it's own right.

Ubuntu Linux uses the Gnome Windows management subsystem
to provide a Desktop Interface to users.
