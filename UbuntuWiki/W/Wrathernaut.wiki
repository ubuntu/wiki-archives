__TOC__

This is my first install of Linux since I played with a "Live Floppy" of Red Hat on a 386.  It lasted about 5min, when I decided to see if root could just "rm *" from / without being any confirmation.  Thus ended my early days of Linux.

Current linux is Ubuntu Dapper Beta on a Acer Ferrari 4005WLMi.  Great laptop, and it's under $2000 US.

I'm deployed in Iraq right now, so gettings things up and running solely on Linux is a little difficult, although getting easier as this place becomes more developed.

I may be contacted at <nowiki>[[mailto:spumoni_pa@hotmail.com|spumoni_pa@hotmail.com]]</nowiki> directly.
