== What We Do ==
<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/iconCircle.png| |align='Right']]</nowiki> The Wisconsin <nowiki>[[LoCoTeams|Local Community Team]]</nowiki> (aka `WiLoCo`) supports Ubuntu users and advocates the use of Open Source software and Ubuntu Linux in the State of WikiPedia:Wisconsin, USA. This is done through CD distribution, team expansion, user-base support, and outreach programs.

The Wisconsin Local Community Team is not meant to replace our local <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_User_Group | Linux User Groups (LUGs)]]</nowiki> but rather enhance their overall experience by having a dedicated place to discuss, contribute, and gain support from local Ubuntu users.

* Fun - We are a fun group, both in person and over IRC. We have a wide variety of Ubuntu enthusiasts: professional developers, sysadmins, IT/CS students, ordinary unskilled users, and their families and loved ones. We have a mission from the Ubuntu Community Council to help advocate, spread, and support Ubuntu. We carry out this mandate together and have a lot of fun doing it.<<BR>>

* Meet - We have both online and in-person events. The online events are generally more technical (fixing bugs, packaging, etc.) and we encourage members who want to learn to attend and ask questions! In-person events tend to be more social, to put a face with that name you met online and hoist a beverage together. We encourage spouses and family members to drop by to social events, and share in your enthusiasm.<<BR>>

* Learn & Teach - Members pool their skills and knowledge on projects, and help teach each other new skills. We also teach more about other Ubuntu Teams like the Bug Squad or the Packaging Team. Some of our members are very active on other teams! If you want to participate in those technical teams, we teach you the skills you need to have fun there, too.<<BR>>

== Joining ==
<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/IconAutorization.png]]</nowiki>
All that is required is residency in or near Wisconsin and a desire to see Ubuntu grow.

There are four steps to joining the team:

1. Please take a moment to fill out <nowiki>[[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dElwRWd1QXRCV2dSYkQ2V1ZwZW1FRXc6MQ | our interest form]]</nowiki>. It will help us to plan better events that you find more interesting, and help us put you in touch with fellow members with similar specialized interests. The form is just a snapshot of your current interests and goals, and your e-mail address is kept private. 

2. On Launchpad, please <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-us-wisconsin | apply to join the Wisconsin Team]]</nowiki>

3. Add your name to the <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-us-wi | Wisconsin Mailing List]]</nowiki>. Once subscribed, please send a "Hello, my name is..." e-mail to the mailing list. We want to know who you are, what part of the state you live in, and what you are interested in learning (or teaching).

4. On Launchpad, please <nowiki>[[http://screencasts.ubuntu.com/2010/12/22/004-SigningCoC | sign the Ubuntu Code of Conduct]]</nowiki>. Signing takes a few minutes, but it's worth the time. (<nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/project/about-ubuntu/conduct | What is the Ubuntu Code of Conduct?]]</nowiki>)

== Events ==
<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/IconUsers.png]]</nowiki>Since you have joined, we do expect you to drop in and participate!

Always remember - ''Don't be a stranger, every word counts, no question is a silly question and every small idea can be big enough to change the world''.

Join us for an <nowiki>[[http://loco.ubuntu.com/teams/ubuntu-us-wisconsin/events|upcoming event]]</nowiki>. Shake hands, and make new friends.  

* Attend one of our in-person 'social' events. <nowiki>[[http://loco.ubuntu.com/teams/ubuntu-us-wisconsin/events | Here's the list]]</nowiki>. Ubuntu Hours, Release Parties, and other events are a great way to meet fellow team members, and have more fun working and learning together.<<BR>>

* Join us for our online 'technical' sessions. These pop up from time to time, and are announced on the Mailing List and the IRC Channel. You don't need to be an expert to participate - learning and teaching and asking questions are part of the process!

== Meetings ==
<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/IconCalendarOpen.png]]</nowiki>We expect members to attend our monthly meeting. It's on IRC, and a great place to introduce yourself, get the latest information, and help plan our future. You don't need to wait for the next meeting, you can get involved today!

 '''Next Meeting''':  ''.''<<BR>>
 '''Location''':  ''irc.freenode.net / <nowiki>[[irc:--irc.freenode.net-ubuntu-us-wi|#ubuntu-us-wi]]</nowiki>'' 

* Help lead the team - if you have an in-demand skill, please help the whole team by offering to to teach it. As you grow in the team and learn the skills, we hope you will participate with coordinating and publicizing events, mentoring newer members, forming interest groups and working groups with other team members, and taking on leadership and admin roles within the team (...like maintaining this wiki!). There is plenty of room for you to enjoy and grow and learn and share. 

== Team Reports ==
<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/IconNotes.png]]</nowiki>
Our <nowiki>[[WisconsinTeam-TeamReports-|monthly summary]]</nowiki> is a great way to see what's happening. We also have details of <nowiki>[[http://loco.ubuntu.com/teams/ubuntu-us-wisconsin/events/history|past events]]</nowiki>, and the minutes and logs of <nowiki>[[WisconsinTeam-Meetings-|past meetings]]</nowiki>.
