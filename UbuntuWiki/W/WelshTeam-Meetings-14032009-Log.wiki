Maw 14 19:03:07 <dariusH>	:(
Maw 14 19:03:11 <dariusH>	present
Maw 14 19:03:17 <ianto>	Alright, on the agenda tonight, we have just two things
Maw 14 19:03:26 <ianto>	So the meeting shouldn't last more than 20mins
Maw 14 19:03:52 <arthurL>	Which item shall we discuss first?
Maw 14 19:03:58 <ianto>	As the Southies here know, NPT and Swansea police forces are merging due to a lack of funds;
Maw 14 19:04:19 <dariusH>	^^ didn't know
Maw 14 19:04:19 <ianto>	We have recently had news of the French police savnig £50M by switching to Ubuntu
Maw 14 19:04:39 <ianto>	dariusH: Evening Post and/or NPT Guardian
Maw 14 19:04:48 <Skyrail>	£50M, wow
Maw 14 19:04:54 <arthurL>	There is an opinion page on the Evening Post
Maw 14 19:04:57 <ianto>	Skyrail: http://www.gearcrave.com/2009-03-12/french-police-adopt-ubuntu/
Maw 14 19:05:08 <ianto>	arthurL: Today's issue?
Maw 14 19:05:23 <Skyrail>	That's pretty amzing
Maw 14 19:05:30 <ianto>	Oops €50M ;)
Maw 14 19:05:44 <dariusH>	that's near enough the same these days
Maw 14 19:05:56 <arthurL>	http://www.thisissouthwales.co.uk/
Maw 14 19:06:12 <arthurL>	^ Bost Noswaith
Maw 14 19:06:21 <ianto>	Obviously, the security services have a great effect on technology, as they are partly linked to the councils who run education too
Maw 14 19:07:02 <ianto>	So for now, what do you think fthe best method of contacting Heddlu De Cymru would be?
Maw 14 19:07:22 <arthurL>	I'll paste the email addresses here ...
Maw 14 19:07:44 <arthurL>	NeathPortTalbot@south-wales.pnn.police.uk
Maw 14 19:07:49 <arthurL>	Swansea@south-wales.pnn.police.uk
Maw 14 19:08:05 <arthurL>	Chief Constable: acpo.staff.office@south-wales.pnn.police.uk
Maw 14 19:08:22 <ianto>	Email the CC and then CC (ironic) the emails to the forces
Maw 14 19:08:45 <arthurL>	Agreed.
Maw 14 19:09:02 <ianto>	However, we need a good written email, showing the strong points of OSS
Maw 14 19:09:08 <ianto>	Benefits
Maw 14 19:09:13 <arthurL>	Shall we Gobby it?
Maw 14 19:09:21 <ianto>	But also we must include some disadvantages not to appear zealots
Maw 14 19:09:32 <arthurL>	True that
Maw 14 19:09:47 <dariusH>	dis- would be incompatability with other police forces
Maw 14 19:10:13 <Skyrail>	And a little bit of retraining
Maw 14 19:10:18 <ianto>	If Regional and/or national adoption eventually, that would no longer be a disadvantage ;)
Maw 14 19:10:19 <arthurL>	One province in France switched and only good news came from it
Maw 14 19:10:20 <Skyrail>	Even though the swap between the two is quite easy now
Maw 14 19:10:51 <arthurL>	The long term benefits outweight the costs of not adopting Ububtu/Linux
Maw 14 19:10:59 <arthurL>	We need to show them that
Maw 14 19:11:21 <Skyrail>	And this French example is a brilliant one :)
Maw 14 19:11:24 <ianto>	Skyrail: Edit our mail to your Northern departments too
Maw 14 19:12:21 <ianto>	Alright, we can all apt-get gobby
Maw 14 19:12:27 <ianto>	and connect to gobby.ubuntu.com
Maw 14 19:12:28 <Skyrail>	D: I guess that would make sense
Maw 14 19:12:43 <ianto>	Cymru is the document ;)
Maw 14 19:17:14 <Skyrail>	Are we editing it now?
