__TOC__

'''Note: This has been replaced by LaptopMission'''

One of our feature goals is "Totally rad laptop support by default".

Things we need to do to get this:
* Power management.
** cpufreqd/powernow. (CPU scaling/throttling) '''done'''
** acpi
*** Policy:
**** Suspend to disk
          Won't always work, but stands a better chance than susp to RAM. <<BR>>
          swsusp. Worth looking at detecting laptop during install and making a bigger swap partition?
**** Battery:
         a. Disable cron on battery?
         a. Enable laptop-mode. Should possibly ask on install and warn it can cause data loss. '''done'''
         a. Monitor daemon's disk/cpu usage
         a. Possibly change RC levels on ac events
         a. Run acpi events if we start on battery power. '''done''' 
**** Gnome Battery applet, remove 'suspend' option and preference.
**** Events: 
         a. Lid 
####### FIXME. Need to bikeshed what we do about this - can't do anything really sane.
####### Lock screen! '''done'''
         a. Powerbutton
            1. Turn machine off (ideally pop dialog).
         a. Sleep button
####### Not for all machines. Suspend to disk probably most reasonable.
####### swsusp+pmdisk merge patches probably required.
         a. AC
####### laptop-mode. '''done'''
####### hdparm spindown time. '''done'''
####### cron magic power flag
####### cpufreqd -> powernowd '''done'''
####### xscreensaver -throttle '''done'''
         a. Battery
** pbbuttonsd (ppc)
***** Suspend on lid shut?
** laptop-mode
**** clean up script.
  More on this in bug #559
* LCD Detection
   1. laptop-detect.
* synaptics touch pad support
   DanielS to test failure mode.
     Not great -- either you can allow all mouse opens to fail, or none. We now do this reasonably sanely in our X packaging, though.
   Potentially add dependency on xfree86-foo to drag xfree86-driver-synaptics
* LCD switch support 
## i855crt for IBMs (DanielStone)
## i810switch (DanielStone)
* 3-button emulation support?
   ShinyBooks and iBooks
 
Not warty, but possibly having packages available would be good.
* i855fix (DanielStone, p.$COMPANY.c)
* tpb and equivs (?)
