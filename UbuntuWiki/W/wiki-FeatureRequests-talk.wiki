==== Sign-feature ====

That would simplify page editing.  No more brain-lifelock-loops like
shall I write '-- UserName' or better '(UserName)' or should I write
'-- UserName'...  I vote for it.  I vote against the date-feature
because the date is already stored in the wiki revision history.

==== Wiki-logout ====

I found it very puzzling that a log out from the wiki is only possible
by quitting my browser.  When there is the possibility to log in I
would expect also the possibility to log out.  An example for a wiki
with log out feature is Wikipedia.  (MarcoWahl)

==== Kurdish translation ====

We would like to see a Kurdish translation of the wiki software. MoinMoin will not include new translations for 1.5.x, and I have no idea when or whether wiki.ubuntu.com will ever upgrade. We are translating the version that's in Rosetta. (ErdalRonahi)
