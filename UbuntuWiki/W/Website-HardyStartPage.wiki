=== Goals: ===

* Google search box needs to be centered and fill the whole width, bumping the right hand column down to start parallel with "Getting help with Ubuntu"
* There is a script that sets the cursor focus to the google search box. It currently runs in the body's onload which causes it to be delayed 2-4 seconds. Instead it needs to be run right after the closing </form> tag to minimize the delay.
* Build script needs improvement. It's very rough
