=== Superceded ===

Willow has now been superseded by WillowNG (https://launchpad.net/willowng), as of August 2010

=== Summary ===

Create a package for willow (http://www.digitallumber.com/software/willow/), a content filtering proxy. 

=== Rationale ===

* Michael wants to use Edubuntu on his school's computers. He needs a simple way to block websites that aren't appropriate for schoolwork.

=== Detailed Plan ===

* make pam support work out of the box
* make sure the webgui works out of the box
* create initscript that reads /etc/default/willow where you can switch proxying on and off
* remove python-profiler dependency so the package get be included in main
* create configuration GUI in PyGTK
