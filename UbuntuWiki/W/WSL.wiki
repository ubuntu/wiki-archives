=== What is WSL? ===

Windows Subsystem for Linux (<nowiki>[[https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/about|WSL]]</nowiki>) allows users to run a Linux environment, without the need for a separate virtual machine or dual booting, providing a seamless and productive experience for developers who want to use both Windows and Linux at the same time.

=== Ubuntu on WSL ===

WSL provides the low level components, such as a customized Linux kernel and utilities, to run various Linux distributions that opt in targeting WSL. Ubuntu provides the distribution that runs on top of that, completing the experience with fidelity to Ubuntu on bare-metal, while leveraging the strengths of WSL.
