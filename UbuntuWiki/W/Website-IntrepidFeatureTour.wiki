__TOC__

The current Feature tour is here 
http://www.ubuntu.com/products/whatisubuntu/804features/

which does a nice job of showing off the features of Ubuntu 8.04 on desktop. There is no need to throw all this out

Some points that should be incorporated in the design 

* The Tour should be modular - so bits can be added and removed as needed without having to take down the entire tour and individuals can look after each module
* It should feature applications in standard Ubuntu that a newbie should expect to get 
* It should have multimedia - http://www.gnome.org/projects/cheese/ is a  great tool for this 
* Localisation would be AWESOME
* The audience is Windows users; they should not be addressed directly but they should find the information they are looking for and be convinced to give Ubuntu a  try.

=== Vitaly Babiy (Vbabiy) Layout Prototype ===

==== How the layout will work ====
The right column will have list of category of Ubuntu features, such as
Internet, Games, Chat and so on. when a user clicks on a category it
will update the descriptions and screen shots. I personal think that
ever screen shot should have a bullet explaining the feature about that
software that is displayed in the screen shot.

Then when a user mouses over or clicks on a screen shot it should update
the screen shot display with the graphic and highlight the bullet that
is describing it in the description section.

I personally think we need this page to be very sexy so when some one
comes to the site using windows or mac they really get the WOW Effect.
