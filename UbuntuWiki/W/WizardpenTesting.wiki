__TOC__

== Info ==

Please add yourself to this list if you have a wizardpen tablet and you are prepared to test new releases and default configurations. This is a highly important step in making sure these devices work out of the box by default in future:

Be sure to join: https://launchpad.net/~wizardpen-testers and make sure you're on the mailing list.

== Testing Procedure ==

All testing steps are carried out with the wizardpen driver installed from the doctormo ppa. Each step is on the computer terminal, also known as the command line. Look for the program 'Terminal' and launch to get access to the command line to follow these steps:

=== Verify that the graphics tablet was added as a usb device ===

'lsusb' should display the graphics tablet listed among the USB devices ('UC-Logic ...' here):

<pre>
user@computer:~$ lsusb
Bus 003 Device 003: ID 5543:0042 UC-Logic Technology Corp. Tablet PF1209
Bus 003 Device 002: ID 046d:c401 Logitech, Inc. TrackMan Marble Wheel <- TABLE IS FOUND
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
Bus 003 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
Bus 004 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
Bus 001 Device 004: ID 8087:07da Intel Corp. 
</pre>

=== Verify the details and inputs are assigned to the graphics tablet ===

The 'dmesg' log contains a record of device activity and will show any errors when you plug the device in. Unplug the tablet, then plug it back in and look through output for 'enumeration' of USB graphics tablet:
(This command asks for 50 lines from the tail end of the dmesg log file)

<pre>

=== Examine the details of the driver installation ===

The /var/log/Xorg.0.log file contains the records of how the inputs shown in the dmesg log above, where then understood by the graphical interface (Xorg).

The program 'less' allows scrolling forward and backwards in the log file, at the prompt ":" type in '/wizardpen' to search for the 'wizardpen' in the log and identify a successful installation.

note: this listing shows the driver installed then REMOVED (due to version mismatch)

=== Calibration ===

The 'wizardpen-calibrate' tool is provided with the wizardpen driver to help set up some ofthe variables for the driver.

<pre>
user@computer:~$ gksu wizardpen-calibrate /dev/input/event13
Please, press the stilus at ANY
corner of your desired working area:
....
</pre>

=== Reporting Results ===

When a problem occurs, stop at that step and do not continue. Report how far you got and the output of the log files proceeding the step you're stuck on to the wizardpen-testers mailing list. https://launchpad.net/~wizardpen-testers

== Other Notes ==

'''UC-Logic WP8060U'''

Just thought I'd mention that as of Natty (Ubuntu 11.04) my tablet worked pretty well without the wizardpen driver, although I now have it installed it does seem smoother. I haven't changed the configuration at all and all areas of my tablet seem to work well.
I have also managed to get the tablet to work on my virtual machines in applications like photoshop, and I even have pressure sensitivity as well.
Generally speaking I have very little trouble with the default configuration, the tablet works well in GIMP,Pinta,Mypaint and most other applications I've tried, it also works well with web based drawing applications like - http://mugtug.com/sketchpad/ for example.

'''UC-Logic WP8060U'''

Dimensions are a bit off. I'm assuming TopX may need to be decreased or increased, depending on how the configuration file works. I haven't been able to take a closer look at it yet. Some of the top of the tablet doesn't respond. It's only a calibration issue. If I get the chance to look into it I'll post any results.

'''Genius F509'''
Tablet works. Macro 'buttons' do not. Slight glitch (believed to be hardware issue) whereby taking the pen off the left edge causes the cursor to reappear at the top about 1/3 of the way along.

'''UC-Logic WP5540U'''

Installed on Maverick. Just pen works (movement and buttons), mouse do not react, except for right button. on Jaunty work like a charm. I didn't setup xorg.conf or anything just add ppa from doctormo, so Top and Bottom comes from 5% and 95%, as /var/log/Xorg.0.log says.
