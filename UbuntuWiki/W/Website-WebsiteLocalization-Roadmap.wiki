* '''OBJECTIVE''': The goal of website localization is to make ubuntu.com recognize a visitors preferred language from their browser and guide them to help in their language provided by LoCo teams.
* '''SUCCESS CRITERIA''': Have a final working product to deliver to Canonical for approval and integration into the ubuntu.com website.
* '''ACTIONS''':
** Mock design of ubuntu.com with localization help.
** Gather resources from different LoCo's to provide to users in their preferred language.
** Code a script to take the browser defined preferred language, cross-reference it against a list of resources identified by language.
