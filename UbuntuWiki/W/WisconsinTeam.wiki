== Ubuntu US Wisconsin LoCo Team ==
<nowiki>[[File:192by192.jpg]]</nowiki>

The Ubuntu US Wisconsin <nowiki>[[LoCoTeams|Local Community Team]]</nowiki> (aka Wi``Lo``Co) advocates the use of Open Source software and Ubuntu in the State of WikiPedia:Wisconsin, USA.  This is done through CD distribution, team expansion, user-base support, and outreach programs.

The Wisconsin Local Community Team is not meant to replace our local LUGs but rather enhance their overall experience by having a dedicated place to discuss, contribute, and gain support from local Ubuntu users. You can find a local event near you by going to the Wisconsin LUG calendar <nowiki>[[https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=ccvfp9csoal0hvl0eok1marhds@group.calendar.google.com&pli=1|here]]</nowiki>.
