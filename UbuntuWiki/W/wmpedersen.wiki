Placeholder for now. I'm rebuilding my profile.
==== Ubuntu-ca Homepage banners ====
The centered one (the hard work):<<BR>>
<nowiki>[[attachment:ubuntu-ca-logo-2.2.png]]</nowiki><<BR>>
Here's a mockup of the site with that banner: <<BR>>
<nowiki>[[attachment:mockup.png]]</nowiki><<BR>>
You won't be able to see on the wiki, but it's a transparent background with a white oval rectangle behind the font and logo. Perhaps it should be the aubergine colour?<<BR>>
The rest I didn't do much other than the basic layout. More will be needed to center the logo and make sure the font styles and backgrounds are lined up.<<BR>>
