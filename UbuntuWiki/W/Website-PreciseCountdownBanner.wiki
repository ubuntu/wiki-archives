=== Countdown banners for Ubuntu 12.04 LTS ===

Post your ideas for a countdown banner here. Guidelines are:

* width: 180px
* height: 150px
* optimized png, gif or jpg, '''or'''
* iframe containing interactive content (using static html, css, js and images - no PHP)
* no flash - must work perfectly with only free software

A successful implementation will countdown the days from Beta (aprox 30 days out) to final release. This means 30 images numbered 30 to 1 plus one for day 0 that says "coming soon" and one more that says "it's here" (32 images total).

For reference see the <nowiki>[[..-JauntyCountdownBanners|JauntyCountdownBanners]]</nowiki>

Post your drafts and mock-ups here along with any extra information you feel is useful then send a message to the <nowiki>[[..-|web presence team]]</nowiki> mailing list so we can discuss it.

=== Winners ===

As always, it is very tough to choose a winner and two runner-ups, but it must be done, so here are the winners:

* <nowiki>[[http://sealview.wordpress.com/|Silviu-Ionut Radu]]</nowiki> banner URL: http://www.ubuntu.com/countdown/banner1.png

To use the banner on your website, place this code on your web-page and change the $$banner_url to the URL of the banner you'd like to show:

<pre>
<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">
  <img src="$$banner_url" 
          border="0" width="180" height="150" 
          alt="The next version of Ubuntu is coming soon">

I feel kind of bad to say that I used a closed source application to make this (Photoshop CS5--Shame on me), but I do like where it ended up. The design is made up of 32 static images in .png format. I've made an archive of all of them (including the .psd) that you can get here: <nowiki>[[http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5187757/Countdown.zip]]</nowiki>, and you can email me at datadude3(at)gmail.com, and I'll try to get back to you quickly.

Ubuntu has always been my linux distribution of choice, and I used it as my main operating system for almost 2 years on my old laptop. Ubuntu was able to breathe new life into that machine, and in the end, I had it for about 5 years before I had to replace it (And even now it runs Ubuntu fine). When I did replace it, I kept Windows as my main OS (again, shame on me), but kept Ubuntu as a virtual machine. I think Ubuntu has a great community, which is why I decided to give back to it (Even with something as simple as a countdown banner).

Hello. This is my first and I hope not the last contribution to the Ubuntu. I have created 32 countdown images using Inkscape. In addition, I have published an archive which includes all 32 images and one .svg file (Link: <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuone.com/3pJxbnreVclBpQEmeh0JXk]]</nowiki>). E-mail: arslan.atajanov(at)gmail.com

Hi!, this is my first contribution to Ubuntu's artwork, I really like Ubuntu since 7.04...
(link: <nowiki>[[http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6184592/Ubunto12.04Countdown.zip]]</nowiki>) The .zip includes 32 cutdown .png images and three .svg templates for inkscape...

The horizontal stripe lets the banner seem lower and wider. Also I tried to be very clean, minimalistic and used a high contrast to attract attention. All renderings, the preview and the Gimp file can be downloaded (at least until April) at <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuone.com/7DpqjIejP3fAwWhmmECLeB]]</nowiki>. For questions, recommendations and reviews I’m looking forward to getting mails via ''postfach2b(at)web.de''.

Hi there! I entered the 11.10 Countdown contest last year and I got an honorable mention, so I entered again! I made some visual changes to last year's 'model', but it's mostly the same code. It's orange, with a white Ubuntu logo in the middle. The background is the same as the Ubuntu website navigation menu. The entire widget is one compressed HTML file, so it loads faster than an image of the same size (An image would be 20 KB, my entire widget is 8 KB). It uses CSS3 and a little JavaScript, and is extremely lightweight.

Any website with my old widget embedded has been updated to the new one, and does not require any code change. If you have any questions, please email me at corbin.d@corbindavenport.com

You can view a demo here: http://corbindavenport.com/ubuntu/
(You can also embed the code)

Hello, all!

I've been familiar with Ubuntu since 5.04 (a long time indeed) and I've always hoped to give something back. So, I've recently started to dabble with GIMP (running on Xubuntu 11.10) and these banner attempts are the outcome and my first contribution (hopefully, the first of many).

Hope you all enjoy it. You can throw all those comments and criticisms at hisham(dot)hamza(at)gmail(dot)com.

Cheers and regards,

Hisham Hamza

Hello Ubuntu World,

I've done Precise Countdown Banner in GIMP and this banner contains 32 png files which are packed in tar.gz. and you can download it from http://ubuntuone.com/1hzlMlClrgaWILHluaf6GI

It's my first contribution in this project and you can send your messages to my e-mail vladimirsojkic(at)ovi(dot)com

Hi I'm Roberto from Durango dgo. Mexico. I'm glad to share with you my design for the 12.04 countdown banner http://ubuntuone.com/1fL2VMuhgcYbYhd9i1JqAH I hope you like it, I'm certain that a very important part of Ubuntu's future rests on the UI design. Unity is a huge step ahead, along with the new Ubuntu font, and I'm sure that your new icon set will be another great success I'm looking forward to see how the T.V and Mobile projects evolve.

Greatings to all the Ubuntu Community and design team.

Hello fellow ubuntu-ers. I'm Stephen from Lancashire, United Kingdom. Here represents my contribution to the design contest for the ubuntu 12.04 countdown banner.

I've been switching from ubuntu and Windows, for college reasons, but have finally landed with ubuntu and I am not using Windows any more. I'm trying to use open-source software and resources, but as you can tell from my contribution it's going slow.

Hope you guys like it.

Thanks to all the ubuntu teams and developers, as well as other contributors.

Greetings to the Ubuntu community. This is my contribution for the release of Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Precise Pangolin edition I've been waiting a long time. The countdown consists in a gear symbolizing the development work, together with the banner "it's here", where I have tried to reflect an geometric and adaptable design.
