__TOC__



I am a lubuntu user and have begun testing the development version of lubuntu and joined lubuntu comms team. 
I started using lubuntu in raring in June 2013 after graduating UCLA. I have then been on the lubuntu irc channel #lubuntu and #lubuntu-offtopic most days.  I have continued supporting in irc for another 18+ months. I also have started becoming usually avialable in #ubuntu-us-ca and became one of the three elected leaders in January 2015. My name I answer to face to face is Lyn Perrine but I do chose this name after one of my pathfinder rpg characters. I do a lot of testing of daily iso and run the development release often and report many bugs. Since 2018 I have been working mostly on the Lubuntu manual.

I go by many different names and am on IRC a lot under ianorlin. I live in California and have become involved with my Loco. I have attened the southern California linux expo the last two years.  I use lubuntu often and have tried done much support on IRC and on testing 14.04 and much more for 14.10 and 15.04. I only started using lubuntu in June 2013. I also graduated from UCLA. The name I go by offline is Lyn Perrine. I am currently seeking employment after graduating UCLA but have trouble finding work but like to contribute more than filing out applications.

hrough the 14.10 cycle and found even more bugs and Think I have like 135 on launchpad. have also made a few changes of broken links on the wiki. And support lubuntu on the mailing list. I am now creating many virtual machines for Lubuntu and trying to improve QA. I have created so many virtual machines testing images that I sometimes have trouble finding out how to orgnanize them I end up creating so many. 

=== Contributions ===

I have helped many people out on IRC on freenode mostly in #lubuntu but sometimes visit other channels. I have found many small bugs in 14.04-16.10. I have also run many testcases on the testing tracker at <nowiki>[[http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com]]</nowiki> but I like the tests better you can see the open bugs I am invovlded with from https://bugs.launchpad.net/~walterorlin.  I continued to test through the 14.10 cycle and found even more bugs and Think I have like 135 on launchpad. have also made a few changes of broken links on the wiki. And support lubuntu on the mailing list. I have also contributed to the manual testcases of lubuntu-manaual-test.s I am now creating many virtual machines for Lubuntu and trying to improve QA and have tested on a fair amount of hardware I have on hand.  I have created so many virtual machines testing images that I sometimes have trouble finding out how to orgnanize them I end up creating so many. I have also made some minor contributions to the wiki like adding super key plus direction arrow to the lubuntu wiki shortcuts. 

=== Future Goals ===
Work and make QA of Lubuntu better. Also learn to traige bugs so I don't create too much work for bug triagers. I also plan to contiue to test in both a virtual machine and real hardware and even do some manual tests of the server images and Desktop ubuntu when I have the time.  Also try to make sure all of lubuntu and every flavor of ubuntu has less bugs and works out of the box for most users. I also want to write testcases for LXQt to help make new versions of lubuntu have much higher quality.

Lyn has proved to be an essential member of the Lubuntu QA team, having gone from doing testing to bug triage to actually fixing bugs, and so on. Whenever I need a quick answer to make a decision as Release Manager, he's always there to help. she's always willing to take something else on, in the true spirit of a valued contributor. I honestly don't know what I'd do without her. Outside of this, he's a great gal, too! -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:wxl]]</nowiki> 
After standing down from the Lubuntu QA team, I have had the immense pleasure in whatching Lyn develop and flourish. With both the Release managers on vacation at the same time, she stepped up that role and got the Beta2 out. I cannot recommend his membership highly enough. <nowiki>[[phillw]]</nowiki> 2015-04-01T18:53Z
