=== Ubuntu/Gnome meeting ===
I have always been interested in computers and heard of linux when I was 12ish but after much scare from others and due to lack to feasible internet, I was stuck in the horrifying world of broken windows until Freshmen year of high school as I found Ubuntu 10.04 and ever since then I have not looked back! Alot has changed since 10.04 in the Ubuntu community in general, but the ultimate spirit is much more vibrant today.
