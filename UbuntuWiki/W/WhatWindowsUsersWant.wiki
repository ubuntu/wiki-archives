=== Introduction ===

While I was happy with my research on WinningTheDesktop, I knew what was there was open to a charge that the survey size (eight of my friends) was not statistically valid. I brainstormed ways to generate quantitative data on what Windows users want and came up with an analysis of the most popular downloads of all time on Cnet's downloads.com <nowiki>[[http://www.downloads.com]]</nowiki>.

=== Methodology ===

Version 1: Data from an advanced search on downloads.com of all software was analysed to determine which were the most downloaded programs ever by Windows users. The top 30 downloads - representing 1.3 billion files downloaded - were analysed. 

Version 2: The methodology was then revised to look at the 250 programs that had over one million downloads each and group them by functionality. These 250 programs represent almost two billion downloads, a reasonable sample size. 
.
=== Limitations ===

As downloads.com only provides demo, shareware and freeware software, this is clearly a subset of all demand. If someone can identify a source of data on best selling commercial software, we can analyse this data is a future project (Amazon???). List not comprehensive/complete - does not track Windows Updates, Mozilla, or numerous others. Should be treated as directional.  

While we believe downloads.com users represent the ideal Ubuntu Linux switchers, this may not be the case.

=== Objective ===

Identify the key software functionality Windows users are looking for and benchmark this demand with current Hoary availability. 

=== Conclusions/Key Findings ===

The Ubuntu Technical Board should consider adding the following functionality to Ubuntu Hoary +1:

1. Chat is huge. 424m downloads! Chat, chat and more chat. How about more chat options out of the box instead of 50 text editors and 100 image viewers? (BTW that's more aimed at open source than Ubuntu)

2. Add more [P2PFileSharing] P2P software. More than 377m downloads of the various competing protocols.

3. Add a download manager with more functionality than Firefox - for example gwget2 - by default. Downloads managers make better use of broadband connections.

4. Add daily changing background functionality (cf webshot <nowiki>[[http://www.webshots.com]]</nowiki>)

5. Easier way to acquire additional RestrictedFormats codecs (mp3, divx, others) (e.g. non-official "Klik"-like site <nowiki>[[http://klik.atekon.de/]]</nowiki>). There is probably a lesson from Firefox's control over plug-ins that we can copy.

6. Fix CD/DVD burning. Ok, let's just get this solved and forget about it.

They say in advertising that the three most powerful words are "Win Free Sex." With windows downloaders, we can construct the ultimate come-on: Ubuntu: '''chat''' while you are '''downloading free stuff''' without getting '''spyware''' then '''uncompress''' and play it on your '''media player.''' That's it - that's the 1.3 billion download sentence. 

Seriously, when we start SpreadUbuntu.com (cf http://www.spreadfirefox.com/), we have the making of a good story. Its just still a little rough around the edges right now. 

=== Results ===

After creating the first version of the results (version 1), I decided there was a better way to display more information, more clearly (version 1). You will find version 1 further down the page..

=== Revised Results (Version 2) ===

* In the revised version I looked at the 250 programs that had over one million downloads and grouped them by functionality. These 250 programs represent almost two billion downloads (1,946m), a reasonable sample size. 

* Please feel free to contribute your thoughts to the availability/issues section, especially on the ones that have a question mark. This is still a work in progress. -Tim

* I have graphed these results, but can't figure out the syntax to add the photo inline here in moinmoin. The image is at <nowiki>[[File:graph.jpg]]</nowiki> - Tim

Note: This list has almost no KDE/qt-software. Check out Kubuntu for applications like Kopete, Kget, Kontact, Kaffeine, Konqueror (with its sftp/ftp/webdav etc protocols), Digikam, Ksnapshot, Konversation etc.. -OttoKekäläinen

=== WhatWindowsUsersDemands ===
Here's my view of what Windows users demand and why they won't change to Ubuntu (and what's need to be done before they'll move to Ubuntu forever). <nowiki>[[WhatWindowsUsersDemands]]</nowiki>

=== Feedback/Discussion ===

* http://www.gnome.org/~clarkbw/blog/GNOME/background_channels - fufills the "desktop changer" one, though afaik, no useful rss feeds for it exist

* Kino for video editing?

* If anyone is interesting in adding to this analysis - think of it as open source market research - I can email you the spreadsheet. With some effort we could count all programs over 1 million downloads. Email me at tjlmorris g ma il. - Tim

1. The main concern about Gaim should be it's lack of features compared to ICQ. The "send file" support is not finished. This one really important restriction. Also the inability to assign custom key bindings to standard actions is one big disadvantage. I think coolnes is a matter of taste. Using the power of GTK+ and themeing Gaim can be as cool as you like it.
17. I don't know if it is aviable in universe/multiverse or elsewhere - but I can't imagine that Xchat-2 is not aviable with Ubuntu. -StefanNicolin (The default XChat in ubuntu is currently (august 2nd, 2005) 2.4 - WouterdenHaan)

* I'm not an ICQ user myself, so maybe "cool" is the wrong word, but 328 million downloads (vs. 26.9m for Firefox) says it has something ("brand" "hype"). I added Xchat to the list. - Tim

* I'm thinking of restructuring the analysis: sorting by functionality first, then listing the programs that offer that functionality. That way the conclusions are more obvious and I can go down the list further (Top 100?). For example:

* I've since done this (version 2 above), though without the list of names as 250 programs was too many to list, though they are listed in the spreadsheet -Tim

* I think the new layout looks good. Also I think your approach to gathering data is nice, since the people who download new software are possibly just the semi-advanced (I'm using the word advanced quite freely here) users that might want to try out ubuntu. Approximating the needs of this particular group in this way is probably quite accurate, though obviously not complete. For example most Windows converts dislike the sloppy mimetype handling in linux, yet this issue is not visible through this method of study. - MikkoVirkkilä

* Be sure to check out the GeneratingStatsOfPopularWindowsSoftware script -MikkoVirkkilä

* Thanks for that. I incorporated your numbers and redid the results. -Tim

* What about a column for things outside multiverse/universe, for example LimeWire and RealPlayer? -Tim

* Some people have reversed engineered the FastTrack/Kazaa protocol, and built a plugin for giFT for it: http://developer.berlios.de/projects/gift-fasttrack . -BasKok

* cups-pdf can be used as a PDF printer. Factual inaccuracy: gconf keys are the same as Windows registry, though there is one gconf registry per user. Solitaire is provided by gnome-games. - Martin-ÉricRacine

* thanks, incorporated; things like this, please just add/change -Tim

* moved flpsed(editor) to limitations/issues as not in universe (can we add it to universe?

good approach, Tim. issue 21 is now solved, because Gnomebaker is available in universe. please add the video edit application because this is popular too for lots of people. second, people like to see each other while chatting ,so ubuntu need to have bettter hardware recognition e.g. webcam and videocamera hardware !!.......Pieter Hollenberg

* There is a lot of different Windows users. I think that most of them will not download software, but stick with IE/MSOffice/(iTunes|WMP). So what is important is to define a "target" population. That can be kids (I think the chat+P2P thing is that), experimented users, occasional users... So define a population and try to get a good part of it is a more reasonable approach than just say "let's get the Windows users". On the one hand, experimented user can be easier to get because they are eager to learn (and able to learn). On the other hand, experimented users have strong habits and applications they like (most of them Windows-only).   -- ErwanLoisant

From Richard Ellis
October 19 2005

There's a forum thread I started last month at LinuxQuestions.org on what MS Windows software is still being used by people with Linux systems. The outstanding productivity application needs seem to be graphics-intensive stuff like desktop publishing (DTP). We need to descend on Adobe and convince them to offer versions of their stuff that can run on Unix systems. They have to already be thinking about this because the new Apple OS X is built on BSD unix. It includes a built-in emulator that can handle older MAC software (Apple uses the euphemism "classic") like PageMaker. A Linux DTP application (Scribus) is being developed but it can't import stuff from other functionally similiar programs and in general it is not really ready yet for prime time.

I notice above a note about some of the Linux media players which implies limited functionality. Functionality of these tools is mostly a matter of installing the appropriate codecs and a web search will quickly surface sources for Linux systems that can handle virtually anything.

From davidkirk May 24, 2006

I think we're missing something here. Counting downloads does not identify all functional uses...  what we're missing is a good usenet reader. The current Ubuntu set of software includes nothing for accessing newsgroups. Windows users have it with Outlook Express, or Netscape 7.x, or Mozilla, or Thunderbird or a number of other clients. Since Thunderbird and Mozilla are available in Linux format, this would help people using Windows to migrate. Another possibility might be the Pan newsreader, but it's a learning curve. The more 'adventurous' crowd in Windows would be open to using Firefox and Thunderbird for their routine Internet access.
