=== About Me ===
I have been playing around with computers for years although I have no formal education in computers. I have a good understanding of HTML, building websites for friends and family. I wish I knew more about PHP and MySql.
I made the switch to Ubuntu last year after a computer crash with Vista. The more I become familiar with Ubuntu, the more I am impressed. I would like to learn more about Ubuntu from a technical aspect and as a committed user.
