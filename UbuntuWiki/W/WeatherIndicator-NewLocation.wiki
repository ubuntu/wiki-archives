Andre Mangan has posted a simple instruction on adding custom location in GWeather - these changes will also be reflected in Weather indicator.

==== How to add extra locations to the Gnome Weather Report/Weather Indicator ====

# Go to /usr/share/libgweather and copy the Locations.xml file and paste it to your Desktop.
# To make this file editable, use the string:
 <code>sed 's/\(<[a-z]\)/\n\1/g' < Locations.xml > Loc.xml</code>
# Use a text editor to open the file, scroll to the entries for your country and insert the 	missing location.  For Australia this occurs at line 4277.
# To add Williamtown, NSW to the list, insert the following after Tamworth ends at line 	4355:
 <pre>		
 <city> 
  <name msgctxt="City in New South Wales, Australia">Williamtown</name>
  <coordinates>-32.79414 151.85333</coordinates> 
  <location> 
   <name>Williamtown Airport</name> 
   <code>YWLM</code> 
   <zone>@IDN11026</zone> 
   <coordinates>-32.73 151.56</coordinates> 
   <radar>IDR043</radar>
  </location>
 </city> 
 </pre>
Tag explanation:
 <name> - town name

 <coordinates> - town coordinates

 <location> - a weather station in the town. Each town should have at least one weather station

 <name> - location name - usually equal to town name, if only one weather station is present

 <code> - airport code, obtainable from http://www.world-airport-database.com/default.aspx

 <zone> - optional field, refers to any zone in the country (e.g. South-east England)

 <radar> - optional field, refers to a radar in the station (if exists)

The ID numbers for your forecast (in this example - @IDN11026) and location of radar (IDR043) can be obtained from your country's meteorological organisation.

1.#5  After adding the necessary information to the “Loc.xml” file, save the file and copy.
# In a terminal, type “gksudo nautilus”, change directory to /usr/share/libgweather and 	paste the “Loc.xml” file.
# Rename the original “Locations.xml” file to (say) “LocationsA.xml” and then rename the 	“Loc.xml” file to “Locations.xml”.
# Exit the terminal and try your newly entered location.

I have noticed that this does not provide a forecast for Sydney since the Australian Bureau of Meteorology changed the @ID information.
