== Make the Wiki More Useful ==
(not a major theme rewrite)

Some things cannot be enabled because of the strict security requirements for wiki.ubuntu.com but if you have a request to make it easier to get your tasks done on the wiki please leave them here.

=== Suggestions Pending Review ===
Please place tasks that you'd like to request here - be detailed and thorough.

* Allow AptUrl links &ndash; VadimPeretokin
* Make better use of space, downsize the font to match that of ubuntu.com, downsize the headings by twice &ndash; Strider
* Make "&lt;&lt;Navigation(children,1)&gt;&gt;" list links without leading "/". &ndash; thorwil
* Automatic thumbnail generation. I think ideal would be to have markup around an image link, so thumbnails don't appear in attachments.
* Notification on new pages generated below a given page.

=== Tasks To Be Done ===
These are tasks that are scheduled to be completed.

* Update text styling on the wiki theme
* Fix "canonical location" problem (see <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-website/+bug/353400|Bug #353400]]</nowiki> for details)
