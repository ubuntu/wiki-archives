== Introduction ==

We’re preparing Ubuntu GNOME Wily Werewolf (15.10) for distribution in  <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WilyWerewolf/ReleaseSchedule | October 22nd, 2015]]</nowiki>. With this '''Beta 1''' pre-release, you can see what we are trying out in preparation for our next (stable) version. We have some interesting things happening, so read on for highlights, known issues and other information. 

'''NOTE:''' 

This is Beta 1 Release. 
Ubuntu GNOME '''Beta Releases''' are '''NOT''' recommended for:
* Regular users who are not aware of pre-release issues
* Anyone who needs a stable system
* Anyone uncomfortable running a possibly frequently broken system
* Anyone in a production environment with data or workflows that need to be reliable

Ubuntu GNOME Beta Releases are recommended for:
* Regular users who want to help us test by finding, reporting, and/or fixing bugs
* Ubuntu GNOME developers

For those who don't know the general difference between '''Alpha''' and '''Beta''':
* With Alpha releases, we don't introduce many new features. The system that you are testing on the Alpha stage is under heavy development, however there is a a great chance you will not notice anything just yet.
* It is very common to see - for example - the slide show of the installer states you are installing 15.04 not 15.10. That's not a real bug when it is Alpha. It would be a bug if we are at Beta.
* You usually start to see some visible differences with Beta but not Alpha.
