__TOC__

I am an experienced though not knowledgable linux user. I've been using Linux exclusively on my laptop for two years, my server for four. The only reason I'm still sticking to Winblows on my desktop computer is the fact that I'm a PC gamer by heart. Unfortunately, Windows comes with the territory there.

I'm a part of the norwegian Ubuntu translator team, and I hope to be part in making Nynorsk ubuntu a reality.
