Create countdown banners for Intrepid:

The banners will be made available from 30 days prior to release on October 30th. 

There is no issue with making a number of these available. It is not desirable to use the code name for Ubuntu 8.10. Ubuntu is for everyone, for novice users especially and Intrepid Ibex is 'insider-speak', great for our internal reference but exclusionary to new arrivals. 

Other than that  - go for it - the more creative the better.

=== Historical ===

8.04 countdown for syndication -
{{http://www.ubuntu.com/files/countdown/804/partner/804countdown_01days.jpg}}

note that it is too big for most sites - should have been a standard
banner size like 180x150 (<nowiki>[[http://www.iab.net/iab_products_and_industry_services/1421/1443/1452|standard sizes can be found here]]</nowiki>)

8.04 countdown for ubuntu.com -

designed to mate against the masthead banner on the homepage

7.10 countdown for syndication -

7.10 countdown for ubuntu.com -

Javascript to display them is quite simple and can be seen here - http://www.ubuntu.com/files/countdown/display.js
(it gets modified at release time in order to change the image from
"almost ready" to "its here" when the release team gives the ok.

I just learned that the banners above isn't the right size. So I've made some new ones in 180x150 px

Comment from nealmcb:
thorwil - I love the counting by hands approach - very human!

It might be too esoteric or difficult to lay out, but would also be cool in other ways, to use Sign Language, which takes fewer hands: http://www.dummies.com/WileyCDA/DummiesArticle/Counting-on-Numbers-in-Sign-Language.id-1972.html
