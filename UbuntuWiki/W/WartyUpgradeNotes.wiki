__TOC__

This page is a place to collect notes about additional actions which need
to be performed for an optimal upgrade to Warty.

=== Upgrading From WartyWarthog pre-releases ===

 0. Add initial user to scanner group: <pre>
sudo adduser $(getent passwd 1000 | cut -d: -f1) scanner
</pre>

=== Upgrading From Debian ===

 0. Switch your /etc/apt/sources.list to the ubuntu servers: <pre>
deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ warty main restricted universe
deb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ warty main restricted universe

deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ warty-security main restricted
deb-src http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ warty-security main restricted
</pre>

 0. Add desktop users to standard groups: <pre>
  adduser $(getent passwd 1000 | cut -d: -f1) $group
done
</pre>
   This $(...) construction looks scary, but it just determines the login
   name of the user who installed Ubuntu. You can replace the whole $(...)
   with the login name, if you are more comfortable with this. Also, repeat
   the process for all users who shall get access to local peripheral
   devices (scanners, CD-ROMs, etc.)

 0. Set up the standard `sudo` configuration, if desired: <pre>
}}}
   This is necessary in order to run system configuration applications from the desktop.

 0. Upgrade from unsupported packages to their supported counterparts:
** `apache` is superseded by `apache2`
** `php4` is superseded by `libapache2-mod-php4`
** `dhcp-client` and `dhcp-server` are superseded by `dhcp3-client` and `dhcp3-server`
** `exim` is superseded by `postfix`

 0. Add modules to /etc/modules if necessary
  See eg https://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1763 .
  I had to add `ide-cd` and `psmouse` to get my cd and synaptics touchpad working.

 0. Note: verify that the cups server User is "cupsys". 
 In /etc/cups/cupsd.conf, make sure the following line is present: {{{
User cupsys
</pre>  
  
 Then, as root, run <pre>
/etc/init.d/cupsys restart
</pre>
 
 This is necessary as some debian cupsys packages have the user set to "lp".
  

=== All Upgrades ===

 0. Install `ubuntu-base` and `ubuntu-desktop` to obtain updated standard desktop package selection: <pre>
sudo apt-get install ubuntu-base ubuntu-desktop
</pre>
   '''NOTE:''' (only applicable to Debian upgrades)
   this will install udev, which will cause your system to manage /dev
   with udev, rather than with devfs or statically.  This may require
   manual adjustments on your part, particularly if you have created
   custom device nodes or symlinks.  It would be nice if there were a
   UdevMigration document.

 0. Upgrade to latest Ubuntu kernel:  <pre>
sudo apt-get install linux-686
</pre>
   Install `linux-<arch>` metapackage to receive the latest kernel and automatic kernel upgrades. 
   Replace `linux-686` as follows:
*** i386 systems should use `linux-386`, `linux-k7`, `linux-k7-smp`, `linux-686` or `linux-686-smp`
*** powerpc systems should use `linux-powerpc`
*** amd64 systems should use `linux-amd64-generic`, `linux-amd64-k8`, `linux-amd64-k8-smp` or `linux-amd64-xeon`
