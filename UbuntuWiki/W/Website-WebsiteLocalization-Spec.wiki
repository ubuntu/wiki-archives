=== Summary ===

The goal of website localization is to make ubuntu.com recognize a visitors preferred language from their browser and guide them to help in their language provided by LoCo teams.

=== Release Note ===

The ubuntu.com website will provide a brief explanation of how to obtain help in a users preferred language based upon their browser settings.

=== Rationale ===

The ubuntu.com website is currently written in English only. There is no desire to translate the website, so we use this project to guide the user in a direction to find assistance in their preferred language.

=== User stories ===

=== Assumptions ===

=== Design ===

Design will be made by the team working on this project, however it must be approved by Canonical prior to implementation.

Suggested placement:

=== Implementation ===

The actual implementation will be done by Canonical.

==== UI Changes ====

There will be a small box that appears on the ubuntu.com website when a visitor to the site has a preferred language setting of something other than English. This should contain very few words in the users language that points them to a page in which they can get more help in their language if such help exists.

==== Code Changes ====

Code will need to be added to the ubuntu.com website to determine the browsers preferred language setting, and then compare that language to a database of languages with more information, then outputting that information on the page.

==== Migration ====

Migration will be done by Canonical.

=== Test/Demo Plan ===

We should have a demo site setup to test the code and implementation prior to actual implementation by Canonical.

=== Unresolved issues ===

When it comes to languages that have many LoCos, how do we want to handle that? And what languages fall into this category?(Example: ES) Options:
* One page for all of ES
* Break it down into different dialects of ES, and if there isn't one specific to that dialect, go to default ES.

=== BoF agenda and discussion ===
