=== Bio ===

I'm an active member of Ubuntu-Women, and help out in the Amarok channel. At present, I'm the editor of the Amarok Insider, and am heading up the writing team for the new Handbook. Locally, I've been active in the Washington LoCo, and am considering volunteering for a leadership position with that team. I staffed a booth at both http://linuxfestnorthwest.org/ and OSCON in 2010, and am now organizing both Ubuntu Global Jam locally, and possibly Software Freedom Day in September.

=== Future Goals for team ===

I want the Washington LoCo to grow, and become official, and continue to have fun.
