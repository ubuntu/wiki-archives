Freelance digital artist for web & print. CSS/HTML/Photoshop/Illustrator/Gimp/Java/PHP/jQureey

Hobbies: Cars, Design, Retro gaming, MAME, Nature, Gardening, Animals, Science, UFC, IRC, Cooking & more.

Education: Still going to college. Been at it for a few years now. It is hard to go to school & makes ends meat.

Goals: To get out of doing manual labor with dreams of having a office job. I plan on doing digital design for web & print as a side job. I would like to get into networking or server type of a job. It would be great to find a company to work for that will train or point me in the right direction for schooling.
