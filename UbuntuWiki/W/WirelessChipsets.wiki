__TOC__

On this page, we want to collect information about the status of specific WLAN chipsets, NOT the devices. Linux drivers are nearly always generic drivers, so different devices with the same hardware are driven by the same driver; normally the system doesn't even know about the vendor of the device. In addition WLAN devices tend to change the real hardware in them very often and without any information to the users.

1) just write "none", if you do not need to install any driver or change configuration files (maybe except /etc/network/interfaces manually.

2) needs wpasupplicant. This is NOT supported on breezy (but might work, as an unconfigured version of wpasupplicant exists in universe).

3) just write "none", as long, as you can't get network-manager to fail on it.

4) it is VERY important to add the IDs here. So a valid entry looks like "ID 046d:c308 Logitech, Inc. Internet Navigator Keyboard" (that example is not a WLAN device ;) or only "ID 058f:6362" if lsusb doesn't have strings.
