== Ubuntu Technical Support ==

'''For a guide on how to obtain and install Ubuntu, please refer to <nowiki>[[Installation|this page]]</nowiki>.'''

This is the centre for free technical support for Ubuntu. There is also a wide range of documentation and user guides available as well as web forums, mailing lists and IRC channels where members of the Ubuntu community will help answer your questions.

For paid technical support services from Canonical Ltd and other organisations, please see the <nowiki>[[support/supportoptions/paidsupport|Services section]]</nowiki>.

=== Documentation and User Guides ===

<nowiki>[[http://help.ubuntu.com/|help.ubuntu.com]]</nowiki>

See the official documentation developed and maintained by the Ubuntu Documentation Project at <nowiki>[[help.ubuntu.com]]</nowiki>.

<nowiki>[[|The Ubuntu Wiki]]</nowiki>

Another important source for information is the Ubuntu Wiki. The wiki is a series of webpages that anybody can edit. You can see what changes have been made recently, and contribute thoughts and ideas to help shape the direction that Ubuntu takes yourself. You need to log in first so that other people can see who edited what. The wiki documentation tends to be a bit more technical and raw in nature. Often, content authored collaboratively on the wiki will be moved over to pages in this website once there is consensus in the team as to that particular goal, feature or decision.

=== Community Support ===

<nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntuforums.org/|Ubuntu Forums]]</nowiki>

User that prefer a web-forum to a mailing list, especially for support related issues, can also use or search the Ubuntu Forums.

<nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/community/lists|Mailing lists]]</nowiki>

Ubuntu development, support, and discussion is currently happening on our IRC channel and our mailing lists. To join any of mailing lists, follow the instructions at the links on the mailing lists page.

IRC (Chat) 

If you're looking for immediate personal interaction, you can ask questions directly to the Ubuntu community in our IRC channel. To use it, join the channel #ubuntu on irc.freenode.net. If you are very new to Ubuntu, and haven't used IRC before, find the XChat program from Applications->Internet on your Ubuntu desktop. Then login to irc.freenode.net and join the #ubuntu channel.

<nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/support/supportoptions/local|Local Language support]]</nowiki>

If you speak a language other than English, you might wish to join one of the Local language support channels or lists to help you solve your problem, or to support new users.

=== Bugtracking ===

<nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/malone|The Ubuntu Bugtracker: Malone]]</nowiki>

For tracking bug reports we used a newly developed bug tracking system called Malone which is integrated with the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/|Launchpad system]]</nowiki>. Check for known bugs or file new bug reports at <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+bugs|launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+bugs]]</nowiki>. Every bug report helps to improve Ubuntu!

=== Is this necessary to have in the support section?? ===

<nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com|The Ubuntu Website]]</nowiki>

This website contains information on our background and philosophy as well as hosting the support/documentation project documentation.
