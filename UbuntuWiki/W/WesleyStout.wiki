=== About Me ===
I am an accountant with a strong interest in how open source can benefit the business world. I'm also a tinkerer that likes to know how things work. This tinkering led me to Ubuntu and all the great options that the open source world can bring to regular Joes not just the programmers and super tech people.

I am currently studying for the CPA Exam and hope to eventually incorporate that and my interest with Ubuntu and open source as an opportunity to help people and their businesses.
