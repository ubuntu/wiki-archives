== Introduction ==

Wayland is designed to not allow elevated (sudo -H, gksu ...) permissions with GUI application programs. It is a good idea to do such tasks with command line tools. But there are workarounds, if you have a GUI tool, that works well for you and needs elevated permissions.

== Temporary access for root to the Wayland desktop ==

1. There is a workaround to allow graphical application programs owned by other users than the logged in user in Wayland,
<pre>
xhost +si:localuser:root
</pre>

2. 'gksu' and 'gksudo' are not bundled with standard Ubuntu. Do not use them. Instead you can use
<pre>
sudo -H
</pre>

3. It is a good idea to prevent graphical application programs owned by other users than the logged in user afterwards,
<pre>
xhost -si:localuser:root
</pre>

== Links to AskUbuntu ==

Several ways to solve this problem are shown at the following link to !AskUbuntu,

<nowiki>[[https://askubuntu.com/questions/961967/why-dont-gksu-gksudo-or-launching-a-graphical-application-with-sudo-work-with-w|Why don't gksu/gksudo or launching a graphical application with sudo work with Wayland? - Question]]</nowiki>

The next link shows the particular method, that is described here,

<nowiki>[[https://askubuntu.com/questions/961967/why-dont-gksu-gksudo-or-launching-a-graphical-application-with-sudo-work-with-w/961978#961978|Why don't gksu/gksudo or launching a graphical application with sudo work with Wayland? - Answer by sudodus]]</nowiki>

== Icon file for the desktop file 'gks.desktop' and the shellscript 'gks' ==

You can download this file, '''<nowiki>[[attachment:gks.svg]]</nowiki>'''. When you arrive at the attachment page, right click on the '''download''' link and select '''save link as ...'''.

The md5sum is
<pre>
$ md5sum gks.svg
7c955ff11d73a996445be99306b83fac  gks.svg
</pre>

== The three files 'gks', 'gks.desktop' and 'gks.svg' ==

You can also download this file, <nowiki>[[attachment:gks-files.tar.gz]]</nowiki>, with the 3 files that are used for this purpose,

* shellscript '''gks'''
* desktop file '''gks.desktop'''
* icon file '''gks.svg'''

The md5sum is
<pre>
$ md5sum gks-files.tar.gz
299e10e42a843ec197ca223179ef1f50  gks-files.tar.gz
</pre>
and the files are
<pre>
$ tar -tvf gks-files.tar.gz 
-rwxr-xr-x sudodus/sudodus   522 2017-10-31 18:45 gks
-rwxr-xr-x sudodus/sudodus   384 2017-10-31 18:44 gks.desktop
-rw-rw-r-- sudodus/sudodus  5633 2017-10-31 18:09 gks.svg
</pre>
You can extract the files with
<pre>
tar -xvf gks-files.tar.gz
</pre>

Copy the [extracted or copied & pasted] files to the following locations,
<pre>
sudo cp gks /usr/bin
sudo cp gks.desktop /usr/share/applications/
sudo cp gks.svg /usr/share/icons
</pre>

Logout/login or reboot, and there should be a working desktop icon, that works via the Gnome Shell menu. It will work directly with the shellscript '''gks''' from Alt-F2 and from a terminal window too,
<pre>
gks gedit myfile.txt
</pre>
