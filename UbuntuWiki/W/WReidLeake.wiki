__TOC__

W. Reid Leake is a full-time student, loving husband and father, and a lover of free software.  OK, I'll skip the third person routine.  My love for Ubuntu started back in the Warty days.  I am AKA reid on ubuntuforums.org.

I was attracted to the SecurityLiveCD project while I was researching how to make one of my own.  A computer security class I took had me using Knoppix-STD.  It is an awesome tool, but a bit outdated.  I wanted to help give back to the community.  I decided that when I had the free time I would try to make a newer version.  The time is not really here yet.  I recently saw Jeff Waugh speak here in Portland Oregon.  One of the things he mentioned is how easy it is to make your own customized Ubuntu-based liveCD.  Curiosity got the better of me and I contacted Fernando Duran, the owner of the project, and he was gracious enough to let me help out.

I am looking forward to the experience, it sounds like a bunch of fun!
