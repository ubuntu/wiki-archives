''What is a Geeknic?''

A geeknic is a picnic for geeks.   ''' http://geeknic.org/ '''   Anywhere there are geeks, a geeknic should happen.

=== The Plan ===

We are going to be meeting outdoors (something unusual for some us geeks) and having a good time. We'll have burgers, hotdogs, and some other good grilling fun. Late July will coincide with OSCON  & CLS, more people.

== Possible locations ==

* Suggestions?
