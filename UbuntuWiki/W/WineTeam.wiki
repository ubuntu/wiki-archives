=== Introduction ===
This page was an attempt to create a larger team for Wine in Ubuntu, however it didn't really work.  It may grow into something larger at some point.

Currently there is no Ubuntu Wine Team, just ScottRitchie

You may be interested in the Wine Team PPA: https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-wine/+archive/ppa
