__TOC__

* MattZimmerman took notes
* The goals for laptop support in [obsoleted by HoaryHedgehog / HoaryGoals] were reviewed:
** To have a useful level of suspend and resume functionality by default
** Both suspend-to-RAM and suspend-to-disk will be available
** We should add a hibernate option to the gnome-session logout dialog and gdmflexiserver
** Closing the lid should trigger suspend-to-RAM by default, but the user can disable it if their system doesn't suspend/resume properly (yet)
** Ideally, we would like to have the system wake up from suspend-to-RAM to estimate battery life, and arrange to suspend to disk before running out of battery
** Sleep and Hibernate buttons, where they generate proper ACPI events, should trigger suspend-to-RAM and suspend-to-disk, respectively
** CPU frequency scaling should work by default in more cases
** Primarily a matter of arranging for the proper kernel module to be loaded for the CPU model
** PaulSladen has done work on parsing `/proc/cpuinfo` and loading the appropriate module (CPUFreqModuleLoading)
** Reduce unwanted disk activity should be reduced, to extend battery life
** Some information is available on IdleDisk
** We would like to fund a bounty project to do this
** JeffWaugh has some notes about things he noticed (e.g., postfix)
** The TRLS power management features in WartyWarthog should be cleaned up in various ways to make them more robust and maintainable
** A single configuration file should hold user preferences for power management (configuration for `acpi-support`, `laptop-mode`, etc.)
** `acpid` and `pbbuttonsd` (and `apmd`?) should share a common set of hooks
** The screensaver locking feature should behave more reasonably with multiple X displays
** `gnome-screensaver` will give us a nice dbus-oriented way to accomplish similar things, but it isn't ready yet
* Suggestions and ideas were solicited from BOF attendees
** The `ibm-acpi` module was proposed for inclusion (<nowiki>[[http://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/1548|bug#1548]]</nowiki>), but it was noted that this module is no longer needed in 2.6.9
** Handling of PCMCIA cards on suspend/resume is not entirely correct yet.  This is a bug, and fixable
** We should disable local APIC on uniprocessors in the -386 kernel as a safer default
** The DSDT/initrd patch will be included in our 2.6.9 kernel, so the replacement DSDTs should be packaged, and if possible automatically selected for loading based on the laptop model

* Deliverables
** ThomMay will ensure that PaulSladen's CPUFreqModuleLoading code enters HoaryHedgehog soon
** DanielStone will create the unified power management preferences configuration file
** DanielStone will implement the common hook infrastructure for `acpid`/`pbbuttonsd`
** JeffWaugh will find out more about the status of `gnome-screensaver`
