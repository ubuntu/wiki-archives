This is my Ubuntu homepage. I am new to Ubuntu, but trying very hard to learn and to spread the word to others.

''Who am I...''

My name is Bill and I am an American living in Japan.  While living in Japan I do what most foreigners do here... I teach English.  Not a bad job, but not all that challenging either.  Certainly not a career, but so far this is serving as a great educational experience for me and a '''MUCH''' needed break in my career.

I am interested to meet others that are living near me that share some common interests.

If you are in Japan (especially in Kanagawa-ken, or Kanto) feel free to drop me an email. Even if you aren't in Japan I would love to hear from you.

Later...

-Bill
