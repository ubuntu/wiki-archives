lucid iso: 
burning audio cdrw via rhythmbox produced a cd that could then be ripped via rhythmbox. Unlike the first one which I burned directly with brasero. That one could be played but not ripped. Strange.
 
to do: The second one made noises about being a text+audio cd. 

<nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/rhythmbox/+bug/514715]]</nowiki>: pressing play while its already ripping is less dramatic. It stutters, but there is no darkening (unresponsive). So the user can just press pause.
