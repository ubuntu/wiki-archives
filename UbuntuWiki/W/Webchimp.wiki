| I hope to do something useful using basic webpage creation skills and dynamic scripting which will help ubuntu and gnu/linux in general to look good to everyone interested.
| I deliberately chose this layout to point out the less-than-usable layout approach that wikis take.
| I'm trying to make up some text to write here, but as you can see I can find nothing worth mentioning here and therefore I have to type in all this gibberish. so you have to simply ignore this cell of the table.
