__TOC__

This page provides some high level comparisons between Windows
and Linux.

 User Logins:: In newer Windows distributions the User Login operations
 are similar to how a user Logs into a Linux machine.
 <<BR>>
 'In each case the user has a Username and a Password'

 Users and Groups:: Both Windows and Ubuntu Linux have Users
 and User Groups

 Ports and devices:: Both Windows and Linux support Physical device ports such as parallel, serial, and USB.
 Various controllers, such as IDE and SCSI, are also supported.

 Networking:: Linux and Windows both support a number of networking protocols, such as TCP/IP, NetBIOS, and IPX.
 Both support a wide variety of network adapters. Both provide the ability to share resources, such as files and printing, 
 through the network. Both provide capability to perform network services, such as DHCP and DNS. 

 Services:: Linux and Windows both have services, applications that run in the background to provide some
 function to the system and to computers that remotely call the service.
 These programs can be controlled individually and be started automatically when the system boots.
 (Note: In Linux these applications are often referred to as daemons, a legacy of its Unix roots.) 

 File systems::Both Linux and Windows work with a variety of file systems. 
 File resources can be shared with through NetBIOS, FTP, or other protocols. 

 File System Hierarchy:: Most Windows users have one physical drive
 and that drive is split into various size chunks. Each of those chunks  
 (sections) is (unfortunately) referred to
 as a Drive having a Letter Designation of C thru Z.
 <<BR>>
 Linux (physical drives) can also be split into various size chunks but
 each chunk has a Directory Name, such as
* usr
* var
* home
* etc

 Filename extensions:: Linux does not use filename extensions to identity a file's type. Rather, Linux looks at
 the header contents of a file to identity the type. You can still use filename extensions for human-readability,
 but Linux doesn't care. That said, some applications, such as a Web server, may use naming conventions
 to identify file types, but that is a factor of the individual applications, it is not a Linux convention.

 File Names:: Windows has many Folder and File names that
 contain embedded spaces, for example
 'My Documents'
 <<BR>>
 Linux allows embedded spaces in File and Directory names
 but the practice is discouraged. However, oftentimes the 
 'period'  or 'underline' character is used instead of a space character.

 Folders:: In Windows a Folder refers to a collection of Files or
 Sub-Folders and Files.
 <<BR>>
 'In Linux a Folder is a Directory' and Directories can contain Sub-directories and files.

 Home Folder:: In Windows there is not a concept of a Home Folder
 but each user has a Folder that matches their Login name on the
 C: drive, under 'Documents and Settings'
 <<BR>>
 In Linux Home folders are (almost always) in the '/home' directory
 and there is a Directory under /home that matches the User Login
 name, such as
* /home/john
* /home/paul
 <<BR>>
 /home directories under Linux can be anywhere and are not
 confined to the /home directory, however, Home Directories 
 are generally in /home.

 Pre-assigned Folders:: Windows has some pre-assigned folders such as
 'My Documents'
 <<BR>>
 Linux does not (currently) create or pre-assign Directory names so
 you will not find a 'My Documents' Directory on a Linux machine
 unless someone created the 'My Documents' directory.
 <<BR>>
 This also applies to the following Windows Folders such as
* My Pictures
* My Anything

 GUI vs Console Interface:: Windows has the 'cmd' feature that
 provides the user with an interface that is command oriented
 and does not go thru the GUI to execute applications etc.
 <<BR>>
 The equivalent feature on a Linux machine is referred to as
 the Console Interface. 
 <<BR>>
 The Console Interface is used almost exclusively by experienced
 Linux users. It is actually possible to boot a Linux machine and
 use the Console Interface  for various operations without starting
 up the GUI. In fact there are times when you may have altered something
 that prevents the GUI from starting and you have to access the Linux
 machine via the Console to correct the problem.
 
 Commands are case sensitive:: All Linux (Console) commands and options are case sensitive. For example, -R
 is different from -r, and will do different things. Console commands are almost always lowercase.

 Internet Browsers:: Windows comes with the Internet Explorer Browser loaded
 and ready to use.
 <<BR>>
 Ubuntu comes with the Epiphany Browser and Kubuntu comes with the
 Konqueror Browser. Both browsers are loaded during the installation of
 Ubuntu/Kubuntu.
 <<BR>>
 The Firefox browser can be installed after the Linux Installation is complete.

 Application Software:: The Windows OS provides many pre-loaded applications
 for sound, processing photos, working with Personal Information Managers and the like.
 <<BR>>
 To add additional applications you have to go to a Company site and download and install
 their application(s). Often Windows applications not written by MS depend on other 
 software packages that you also have to download and install to get additional application
 to run.
 <<BR>>
 <<BR>>
 Linux comes with similar applications but most additional applications come from the
 Ubuntu site and have been written for and tested on your current Ubuntu release.
 <<BR>>
 Ubuntu will only provide free software covered by the GPL licensing agreement(s).
 Some Nvidia video drivers are not provided by the Ubuntu Distribution because
 they are considered restricted and contain code the manufacturer says is
 proprietary. However, most of this code can be downloaded from various
 restricted repositorie(s) and installed on your machine.
 <<BR>>
 When you download and install a Ubuntu (99% of the time) package all the
 dependent software required to run that package is downloaded and installed
 at the same time.

 Rebooting is a last resort:: If you have been using Windows for a long time, you are accustomed to rebooting the system
 for many reasons, from software installation to correcting problems with a service. The system design of Linux prevents
 applications from corrupting the kernel, which is why it doesn't need frequent reboots (in contrast to Windows system design).
 So  except for the Linux kernel, you can install, start, stop, and reconfigure (most) software without having to reboot the system.
