The WeMenu concept was picked up and reported by the "Ubuntu Forecast" blog http://ubuntuforecast.wordpress.com/2010/10/28/ubuntu-to-challenge-facebook/

''Interesting idea. I’m really looking forward to see where this will be going. I’m very happy you talk about integrating it with other FLOSS projects instead of (only) the big proprietary monopolies (Fb, Twitter, etc.).

About placement: I really have no idea why the MeMenu and the “envelope” indicator applet are two different applets on the panel. It makes no sense to me. They both deal with communication, trough the exact same apps. It’s confusing to me, who’s fairly technical, so I can only imagine how confusing it is to “human beings”.

The logical thing would be to merge the MeMenu into the envelope, IMHO. Then you have lots of free space for the WeMenu.''
