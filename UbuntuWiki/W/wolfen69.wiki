~+'''About Me'''+~

I am Wolfen69 (Ed) and have been a linux user since 2003, and Ubuntu Forums member since Dec. 2004. I am located in Marietta, GA, (near Atlanta) USA. After being dissatisfied with other operating systems, I decided that linux fit the bill for me personally. I discovered Ubuntu Linux soon after the release of 4.10. The philosophy behind the Ubuntu Community and OS is second to none in my opinion, and is the reason I have been a long time user. I also fix friends and families computers and in general love what I do. :) I have also converted many people to linux.

~+'''Contributions'''+~

I have spent many hours helping people on the forums, and take great pleasure when I can help someone with their problem. Although I'm no linux guru, I do my best to help people, and find answers. I have also written a couple of tutorials that have been published on Lxer.com (linux news site) and Ubuntu Forums that I hope people have found useful in their quest to use Ubuntu to it's fullest.

I also regularly report bugs to Launchpad, and try out beta software to help out developers with feedback.

~+'''Future Plans'''+~

I am currently a member of the Ubuntu Beginners Team, Users of the Ubuntu Etherpad instance, Kubuntu Bugs, Lubuntu Team, and Ubuntu BugSquad. I hope to contribute as much as possible on the forums, and wherever my help is needed.
