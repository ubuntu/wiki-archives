I've been running Ubuntu exclusively since Edgy and have been using Linux off and on before that for several years.  I'm a proponent of FOSS, open standards, and the free exchange of information.  

Currently I'm setting up a LUG in the central Louisiana area.  If you're interested in joining we'd be glad to have you!

I'm also a proud member of the <nowiki>[[LouisianaTeam|Louisiana LoCo]]</nowiki>.  I'm looking forward to helping promote Ubuntu in the local community and statewide.
