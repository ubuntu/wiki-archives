Describe walterorlin/installssdandhdd here.

If you have for example a custom built computer or something with an ssd while they are a fast they do not offer the most storage. If you have many small files and want quick program startup you may want  to have your applicatoins to launch quickly off the ssd.  This guide will tell you how to setup the system with a solid state disk with a root partition and  the home partition on your hard disk. 

Reason why you would want this. If you download and store lots of media locally this can take up quite a bit of space.  SSD offer great performance in terms of input and output but are expensive for massive storage. SSD are best at offering lots of different small files quickly or random io. 

To do this from the desktop installer you will need to use boot and choose something else from the menu.
