__TOC__

* What: Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid Lynx! Free cake! Geek socializing!
* Who: Anyone interested in celebrating the Lucid Lynx Official Release. Children of all ages are welcome.
* Where: <nowiki>[[http://www.stellarpizza.com/location.html|Stellar Pizza]]</nowiki> in the Georgetown neighborhood of Seattle.
* When: Thursday, April 29th from 7pm to 9pm
* How to spot us: There will be a tux penguin on the table. We will be talking about Ubuntu a lot. If you still can't find us, ask up front for the Ubuntu party.

'''RSVP''': http://loco.ubuntu.com/events/team/132/detail/

Note: Stellar Pizza is a restaurant and bar. Here is <nowiki>[[http://www.stellarpizza.com/menu.html|Stellar Pizza's Menu]]</nowiki>. There will be a single check with 18% gratuity if 6 or more people show up, which is highly likely. Stellar only accepts one card per check. '''Please be prepared to pay in cash or buy everyone dinner.''' We'll love you for it. 

We'll have a few burned copies of the official release iso, as well as some blank media and CD burners. Seattlegaucho has kindly volunteered to help people setup bootable USB sticks with the official release ISO.
