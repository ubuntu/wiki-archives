== Wisconsin Meeting History - September 5, 2007 ==

The conclusions for the second meeting are below:

1. '''Website Discussion'''

* The Ubuntu Wisconsin Team should create a team website.
* ''lifewithryan'' will be able to provide free hosting if you choose a ''sub''domain of an existing website or assuming method of payment of a new domain name is decided upon.
* Ideas for the website are being thrown around here:  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=544067

2. '''Communication Channel'''

* The web forums and mailing list should be used heavily.
* The mailing list should be for internal usage (regular/active members should share ideas and discuss topics via the mailing list).

{{{
Sep 05 20:11:07 <Ek0nomik>	Ayuthia sent me a message with a few ideas:
Sep 05 20:11:13 <Ek0nomik>	"Sounds like there are thoughts about how and where we should post things. Also, there are some ideas about team projects."
Sep 05 20:11:43 <Ek0nomik>	"post things", is in regards to mailing list versus forum.
Sep 05 20:12:46 <lifewithryan>	back
Sep 05 20:13:20 <Ek0nomik>	k.
Sep 05 20:13:30 <lifewithryan>	wll list vs. forum...serve two different audiences really
Sep 05 20:14:11 <Ek0nomik>	imo, yes, but it will also overlap.
Sep 05 20:14:23 <lifewithryan>	the list is mainly for our group...the forums well are more "open to everyone" though I suppose anyone can signup to the lsit
Sep 05 20:14:25 <lifewithryan>	er list
Sep 05 20:14:44 <lifewithryan>	i guess my thought see what most people are using...
Sep 05 20:14:50 <Ek0nomik>	indeed.  I think people less tech savvy will be making posts on the forums.
Sep 05 20:15:01 <lifewithryan>	 and i haven't seen many emails going out
Sep 05 20:15:10 <lifewithryan>	plus...alot of people get enough email...
Sep 05 20:15:16 <lifewithryan>	so I vote for forums...
Sep 05 20:15:18 <Ek0nomik>	both have their benefits.
Sep 05 20:15:28 <lifewithryan>	(if we're picking one or the other that is)
Sep 05 20:15:41 <MethodOne>	i go for the forums
Sep 05 20:16:11 <Ek0nomik>	yeah, I like the forums too... mainly because from personal experience, the forums is where I first got involved in the first place.
Sep 05 20:16:14 <lifewithryan>	i mean to keep it purely "service oriented" so to speak...problems issues with the OS/Setup etc should be forums
Sep 05 20:16:28 <lifewithryan>	administration of the group or "internal group stuff" should be on the email list
Sep 05 20:16:46 <Ek0nomik>	yeah.  we need to make sure people get on that mailing list though.
Sep 05 20:16:53 <Ek0nomik>	I feel like we need a way for it to stand out a bit more.
Sep 05 20:17:04 <lifewithryan>	harumph...
Sep 05 20:17:12 *	lifewithryan is thinking
Sep 05 20:17:32 <Ek0nomik>	maybe that's just me, but I think it does.
Sep 05 20:17:54 <lifewithryan>	i guess the email list and its exposure would kinda go hand and hand with the team "site"
Sep 05 20:18:04 <lifewithryan>	who we are, what we do, our goals etc
Sep 05 20:18:10 <lifewithryan>	just thinking off the top of my head here
Sep 05 20:18:54 <lifewithryan>	so get a "site" in order, and stress that if you really want to be a core part of the group, its a good idea to signup to the email list
Sep 05 20:19:10 <lifewithryan>	just a thought
Sep 05 20:19:36 <lifewithryan>	(if i'm babbling, tell me to shut up)
Sep 05 20:20:33 <Ek0nomik>	lol.  you're not babbling at all.
Sep 05 20:20:49 <Ek0nomik>	having a group website was another topic on its own really
Sep 05 20:20:59 <Ek0nomik>	there seemed to be some apprehension towards it.
Sep 05 20:21:08 <Ek0nomik>	mostly fee's as far as I remember.
Sep 05 20:21:25 <Ek0nomik>	building the website would be fairly easy... just a static website would really serve a purpose, with perhaps a wordpress blog or something.
Sep 05 20:22:38 <lifewithryan>	don't worry about hosting...I may be able to provide it
Sep 05 20:22:45 <lifewithryan>	(i resell hosting with a buddy of mine)
Sep 05 20:23:01 <lifewithryan>	so as long as we didn't get tons of traffic...its quite doable.
Sep 05 20:23:09 <Ek0nomik>	well that might solve the debate entirely, because if it's free then we might as well.
Sep 05 20:23:19 <Ek0nomik>	it would be "free" right?  I don't want you paying any money out of your pocket.
Sep 05 20:23:22 <Ek0nomik>	:)
Sep 05 20:23:28 <lifewithryan>	I'd even be willing to host it off a subdir of my moonlighting gig's website
Sep 05 20:23:38 <Ek0nomik>	moonlighting?
Sep 05 20:23:41 <lifewithryan>	so something like www.gnumoon.com/TeamWisconsin
Sep 05 20:24:03 <lifewithryan>	yeah...I work 8 to 5 for a consulting firm, but then i run my "own" show after hours to bring in some extra cash
Sep 05 20:24:20 <Ek0nomik>	hmm.
Sep 05 20:24:26 <Ek0nomik>	What does gnumoon do?
Sep 05 20:24:37 <lifewithryan>	we do mainly PHP/Linux type stuff...and since we're "moonlighting" we cam up with GnuMoon
Sep 05 20:24:50 <lifewithryan>	but my partner is security/network focused
Sep 05 20:25:17 <Ek0nomik>	who are you after?  small business?
Sep 05 20:25:40 <lifewithryan>	yeah...mainly small business/mom & pop shops...the people who can't really afford the bigger firms
Sep 05 20:26:05 <Ek0nomik>	that's cool.
Sep 05 20:26:09 <Ek0nomik>	you keep pretty damn busy.
Sep 05 20:26:39 <lifewithryan>	but without paying for a domain name...the only option is to piggy back of something else, that's why I threw it out there
Sep 05 20:26:51 <Ek0nomik>	yeah, I understand.
Sep 05 20:27:00 <lifewithryan>	but doesn't the ubuntu Loco stuff let us make our own page?
Sep 05 20:27:04 <lifewithryan>	for free
Sep 05 20:27:19 <Ek0nomik>	you mean getting a subdomain of some overall LoCo site?
Sep 05 20:27:23 <Ek0nomik>	I'm not sure...
Sep 05 20:27:51 <lifewithryan>	just a sec
Sep 05 20:28:19 <lifewithryan>	ahhh nevermind...
Sep 05 20:28:39 <Ek0nomik>	I could even host one on one of my boxes.
Sep 05 20:28:42 <lifewithryan>	yeah...if you guys *want* to do a site...we gotta come up with what the site will be used for
Sep 05 20:29:00 <Ek0nomik>	and use dyndns to route to my box.
Sep 05 20:29:11 <lifewithryan>	so if you're thinkin blog...how often, what to blog about etc
Sep 05 20:30:13 <lifewithryan>	the hard part i guess is coming up with "vision" for what this groups purpose actually is
Sep 05 20:30:30 <lifewithryan>	sure, spread the word of ubuntu...but what else?
Sep 05 20:31:09 <Ek0nomik>	help with installation?
Sep 05 20:31:28 <Ek0nomik>	I've helped two of my roomates get it on their laptops/desktops.
Sep 05 20:31:42 <Ek0nomik>	and next weekend I will be helping my girlfriend install it.
Sep 05 20:31:54 <lifewithryan>	okay...but playing devil's advocate here...isn't that what the forums would be for?  so perhaps rather than a full-fledged web site...perhaps more of a portal
Sep 05 20:32:21 <Ek0nomik>	portal?
Sep 05 20:32:21 <lifewithryan>	with the occasional blog message or something?
Sep 05 20:32:39 <MethodOne>	the group can help locals in person
Sep 05 20:32:44 <lifewithryan>	yeah...a site that basically is the central repository for all things "Ubuntu Team Wisconsin" related
Sep 05 20:32:54 <lifewithryan>	very good idea MethodOne
Sep 05 20:33:08 <Ek0nomik>	Method:  indeed, just needs to be advertised.
Sep 05 20:33:10 <lifewithryan>	is anyone logging this?
Sep 05 20:33:15 <Ek0nomik>	yeah, I'm on it.
Sep 05 20:33:40 <MethodOne>	i advertised the group on facebook
Sep 05 20:33:48 <MethodOne>	in my local network
Sep 05 20:33:52 <Ek0nomik>	yeah we have a facebook group too, lol.
Sep 05 20:34:01 <MethodOne>	the sheboygan, wi one
Sep 05 20:34:29 <lifewithryan>	cool...so far we've got UbuntuTeamWisconsin site would have links to the forums, the wiki, a sort of mission statement, event calendar, possible blog
Sep 05 20:34:48 <Ek0nomik>	 a "How to get started" page would be beneficial I think.
Sep 05 20:34:56 <Ek0nomik>	basically laying out all the resources.
Sep 05 20:34:58 <lifewithryan>	yeah
Sep 05 20:35:05 <Ek0nomik>	and what we use them for.
Sep 05 20:35:14 <lifewithryan>	very good
Sep 05 20:35:31 <lifewithryan>	(good experience for ya Ek0
Sep 05 20:35:37 <Ek0nomik>	what is?
Sep 05 20:35:39 <lifewithryan>	roll up them PHP sleeves
Sep 05 20:35:44 <Ek0nomik>	hahha.
Sep 05 20:35:46 <lifewithryan>	(i was kidding)
Sep 05 20:36:04 <Ek0nomik>	I'm reading "The Goal", I've got my head in the game.
Sep 05 20:36:08 <lifewithryan>	i don't mean to "volunteer" anyone
Sep 05 20:36:14 <lifewithryan>	lol
Sep 05 20:36:24 <Ek0nomik>	need to read it for Management 341.  :P
Sep 05 20:36:30 <Ek0nomik>	good book though actually.
Sep 05 20:36:36 <lifewithryan>	never read it :)
Sep 05 20:36:49 <Ek0nomik>	I could work on it lifewithryan, but I may be a bit slower on the ball now that school started.
Sep 05 20:36:52 <Ek0nomik>	but I definitely have free time.
Sep 05 20:37:15 <lifewithryan>	well, we could do something like Joomla
Sep 05 20:37:29 <lifewithryan>	not that I'm a big fan of Joomla
Sep 05 20:37:35 <lifewithryan>	but its quick and easy
Sep 05 20:38:02 <Ek0nomik>	I had never heard of it tbh.
Sep 05 20:38:27 <lifewithryan>	its just a content management system with templates, etc...allows you to throw up a site really quickly
Sep 05 20:38:36 <lifewithryan>	www.gnumoon.com (done in joomla)
Sep 05 20:38:40 <lifewithryan>	in minutes
Sep 05 20:39:23 <Ek0nomik>	hmm.
Sep 05 20:39:37 <Ek0nomik>	we could definitely use it I suppose.
Sep 05 20:39:41 <lifewithryan>	not that that is a "model" site by any means...just an example
Sep 05 20:39:51 *	Vorian (n=Steve@ubuntu/member/pdpc.supporter.active.Vorian) has joined #ubuntu-wisconsin
Sep 05 20:39:54 <lifewithryan>	(if you're worried about time...other than that, i'd opt for roll your own)
Sep 05 20:40:06 <lifewithryan>	welcome Vorian
Sep 05 20:40:12 <Vorian>	hello :)
Sep 05 20:40:17 <Ek0nomik>	I don't know if I'd want to roll my own blog right away though.
Sep 05 20:40:34 <lifewithryan>	heh...probably not...wordpress is good
Sep 05 20:40:44 <lifewithryan>	not sure what all you can do with it though
Sep 05 20:40:52 <Ek0nomik>	with what?  wordpress?
Sep 05 20:40:56 <lifewithryan>	yeah...
Sep 05 20:41:09 <lifewithryan>	can you have event calendars and such?  i've only ever used it for blog
Sep 05 20:41:43 <Ek0nomik>	just a calendar with important dates?  I am not sure if it's built into wordpress, but there are probably plenty of alternatives we could use.
Sep 05 20:41:46 <Ek0nomik>	javascript etc.
Sep 05 20:41:56 <lifewithryan>	yeah
Sep 05 20:42:08 <lifewithryan>	i just thought there was a worry about time
Sep 05 20:42:21 <lifewithryan>	or are you talking pre-built javascript?
Sep 05 20:42:31 <Ek0nomik>	pre-built.
Sep 05 20:42:38 <lifewithryan>	aahh :)
Sep 05 20:42:39 <lifewithryan>	k
Sep 05 20:43:58 <lifewithryan>	so...have we justified the need for a website?
Sep 05 20:45:17 <lifewithryan>	just askin...
Sep 05 20:45:37 <lifewithryan>	(pardon me if I seem like i'm a jerk or something...i'm very tired and cranky today)
Sep 05 20:46:04 <Ek0nomik>	lol, no worries.
Sep 05 20:46:10 <Ek0nomik>	I think a website would be beneficial.
Sep 05 20:46:15 <Ek0nomik>	what do you think?
Sep 05 20:46:19 <Ek0nomik>	and MethodOne?
Sep 05 20:46:24 <lifewithryan>	i say "yea"
Sep 05 20:46:34 <MethodOne>	yes
Sep 05 20:47:06 <lifewithryan>	heh...well out of the three of us here (four if Vorian wishes to chime in) sounds like its unanimous...lol
Sep 05 20:47:28 <lifewithryan>	so put on the agenda for the next meeting to perhaps nominate a team or a person to head that venture up?
Sep 05 20:47:29 <Vorian>	word press
Sep 05 20:47:33 <Vorian>	ftw
Sep 05 20:48:09 <Ek0nomik>	done deal.
Sep 05 20:48:58 <lifewithryan>	sweet
Sep 05 20:49:43 <Ek0nomik>	maybe I will try to built a few layouts or something.
Sep 05 20:49:54 <lifewithryan>	cool
Sep 05 20:51:42 <Ek0nomik>	I could make a thead where people can post designs I suppose.
Sep 05 20:51:48 <Ek0nomik>	although many probably wouldn't get submitted, lol.
Sep 05 20:52:27 <lifewithryan>	still...worth a shot...
Sep 05 20:52:44 <lifewithryan>	just promise me there won't be any flash ;)
Sep 05 20:52:49 <Ek0nomik>	nope.
Sep 05 20:53:44 <Ek0nomik>	probably a bunch of javascripts to change the mouse cursor, some midi files playing in the background.  :P
Sep 05 20:54:13 <lifewithryan>	*ugh* :)
Sep 05 20:54:16 <Ek0nomik>	hahha.
Sep 05 20:54:25 <lifewithryan>	believe it or not, i've had clients ask for some of that stuff
Sep 05 20:54:30 <Ek0nomik>	no doubt.
Sep 05 20:54:47 <lifewithryan>	the client will always choose dancing hippos over rich features :)
Sep 05 20:55:44 <Ek0nomik>	maybe we should have flash... perhaps a badger, badger, badger intro?
Sep 05 20:55:46 <Ek0nomik>	;)
Sep 05 20:55:58 <lifewithryan>	thats hilarious :)
Sep 05 20:59:35 <lifewithryan>	ugh...i hate getting things to validate with the W3C
Sep 05 20:59:40 <lifewithryan>	well...old things that is
Sep 05 20:59:47 <Ek0nomik>	what are you working on?
Sep 05 21:00:00 <lifewithryan>	more crap for one of my 8 to 5 clients...
Sep 05 21:00:08 <Ek0nomik>	ah.
Sep 05 21:00:16 <Ek0nomik>	where in Madison do you work?
Sep 05 21:00:29 <lifewithryan>	we wrote a system for them like 7 years ago...back before people really followed W3C standards...and now we're paying the price
Sep 05 21:00:33 <lifewithryan>	...ouch...
Sep 05 21:00:59 <Ek0nomik>	what happened?
Sep 05 21:01:06 <lifewithryan>	a small consulting firm...used to be call Isthmus Group but we merged with another company and now we're call CCC (comprehensive computer consulting)
Sep 05 21:01:26 <lifewithryan>	...ouch... = paying the price for not writing valid code in the first place
Sep 05 21:01:27 <Ek0nomik>	east side?
Sep 05 21:01:32 <lifewithryan>	yeah
Sep 05 21:01:38 <lifewithryan>	sun prarie actually

Sep 05 21:02:28 <lifewithryan>	cool

Sep 05 21:05:28 <Ek0nomik>	ah.

Sep 05 21:07:47 <Ek0nomik>	ttyl.
Sep 05 21:07:54 <Ek0nomik>	rob-e:  We were discussing a website mostly.
Sep 05 21:08:08 <Ek0nomik>	MethodOne, lifewithryan, and myself think we should have one.
Sep 05 21:08:15 <rob-e>	i think so too
Sep 05 21:08:18 <Ek0nomik>	lifewithryan can provide the hosting on a subdomain of some other site.
Sep 05 21:08:39 <rob-e>	sweet
Sep 05 21:09:18 <hertelj1>	hi all
Sep 05 21:09:38 <rob-e>	hey
Sep 05 21:10:01 <Ek0nomik>	hey hertel.
Sep 05 21:10:13 <hertelj1>	what kind of things are you thinking about putting on the site"
Sep 05 21:10:15 <hertelj1>	?
Sep 05 21:11:13 <Ek0nomik>	<lifewithryan> cool...so far we've got UbuntuTeamWisconsin site would have links to the forums, the wiki, a sort of mission statement, event calendar, possible blog
Sep 05 21:11:13 <Ek0nomik>	<Ek0nomik>  a "How to get started" page would be beneficial I think.
Sep 05 21:11:13 <Ek0nomik>	<Ek0nomik> basically laying out all the resources.
Sep 05 21:11:13 <Ek0nomik>	<lifewithryan> yeah
Sep 05 21:11:13 <Ek0nomik>	<Ek0nomik> and what we use them for.
Sep 05 21:11:13 <Ek0nomik>	<lifewithryan> very good
Sep 05 21:11:29 <rob-e>	yeah, are you gona go as far as forums or just kinda just info
Sep 05 21:11:39 <Ek0nomik>	blog/info.
Sep 05 21:11:45 <rob-e>	damn lag
Sep 05 21:11:49 <Ek0nomik>	could do forums, but it'd be redundant as we have forums on ubuntuforums.
Sep 05 21:11:58 <hertelj1>	a getting started page sounds like a good idea
Sep 05 21:12:11 <hertelj1>	maybe with links to loco members who could help
Sep 05 21:12:31 <Ek0nomik>	that's a good idea too.
Sep 05 21:12:53 <hertelj1>	I think an explanation of what an OS is would probably be helpful
Sep 05 21:13:19 <hertelj1>	I have found that most users who I talk to have no idea what Operating System means
Sep 05 21:13:31 <rob-e>	i think the sign-up process should be less confusing, i was a bit confused
Sep 05 21:13:54 <rob-e>	+1
Sep 05 21:13:55 <hertelj1>	They are inclined to think computers come in two varieties Windows and Mac
Sep 05 21:14:27 <MethodOne>	do you mean os x instead of mac?
Sep 05 21:14:34 <hertelj1>	yes :)
Sep 05 21:14:35 <hertelj1>	sorry
Sep 05 21:14:42 <Ek0nomik>	indeed, that could be beneficial too.
Sep 05 21:15:09 <rob-e>	maybe an embedded irc chat thing to this channel
Sep 05 21:15:24 <Ek0nomik>	that's another good idea.
Sep 05 21:15:29 <hertelj1>	Would it beneficial to start a thread for "web page suggestions"
Sep 05 21:16:38 <Ek0nomik>	definitely.
Sep 05 21:16:44 <Ek0nomik>	I take it you're already on it?
Sep 05 21:16:49 <hertelj1>	:)
Sep 05 21:16:57 <Ek0nomik>	link me when you are done.
Sep 05 21:16:59 <Ek0nomik>	I'll sticky it.
Sep 05 21:17:36 <hertelj1>	nothing like showing up late and then pretending like I did all the talking
Sep 05 21:17:38 <hertelj1>	:)
Sep 05 21:17:56 <rob-e>	haha
Sep 05 21:18:52 <rob-e>	do any other states teams have websites we can get ideas from?
Sep 05 21:19:14 <Ek0nomik>	I imagine some must have one, we can check.
Sep 05 21:19:28 <hertelj1>	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=544067
Sep 05 21:20:37 <Ek0nomik>	stickied.
Sep 05 21:20:51 <hertelj1>	Should I submit the ideas you pasted
Sep 05 21:21:39 <Ek0nomik>	I am right now.
Sep 05 21:21:59 <rob-e>	what happend to the other sticky?
Sep 05 21:23:08 <Ek0nomik>	the one about the first meeting?
Sep 05 21:23:10 <Ek0nomik>	I took it down.
Sep 05 21:23:19 <Ek0nomik>	I will post information about the second meeting later.
Sep 05 21:23:43 <rob-e>	o, yea that was it
Sep 05 21:24:03 <hertelj1>	Was there any discussion on the "Ideas for getting the word out" thread?
Sep 05 21:24:27 <Ek0nomik>	nope.
Sep 05 21:24:30 <Ek0nomik>	we didn't discuss it.
Sep 05 21:25:03 <hertelj1>	I thought there was some nice discussion
Sep 05 21:25:07 <rob-e>	http://ohio.ubuntu-us.org/
Sep 05 21:25:12 <rob-e>	theres one
Sep 05 21:25:31 <Ek0nomik>	discussion where hert?
Sep 05 21:26:03 <hertelj1>	on the thread I mean :)
Sep 05 21:26:24 <rob-e>	should we steal the ubuntu layout like them?
Sep 05 21:26:44 <hertelj1>	brucewagner's last comment was good
Sep 05 21:27:08 <hertelj1>	I think a THREE PRONGED attack would be best...
Sep 05 21:27:08 <hertelj1>	ONE EVENT, on a regular basis (monthly?), which would offer three things:
Sep 05 21:27:08 <hertelj1>	(1)   HANDS ON DEMOS to let me play with a working Ubuntu, Open Office, best of breed open source software, setup....
Sep 05 21:27:08 <hertelj1>	(2) INSTALL CLINIC where users could even bring in their entire machineand have experienced geeks install it for them on the spot! *
Sep 05 21:27:09 <hertelj1>	(3)   AFTER INSTALL SUPPORT LINE
Sep 05 21:27:14 <Ek0nomik>	rob-e:  We might take some.
Sep 05 21:27:57 <rob-e>	yeah, idk if i digg it too much
Sep 05 21:28:17 <hertelj1>	I'm sure if it is feasible, but I liked his idea of trying to have a larger, continuing plan that includes an installfest but is not completely centered around one day
Sep 05 21:28:34 <hertelj1>	I meant to say I'm not sure if it is feasible
Sep 05 21:29:04 <Ek0nomik>	an install fest would be sweet, but location is the issue.
Sep 05 21:29:31 <rob-e>	yeah
Sep 05 21:30:08 <rob-e>	i think the installfests should occour regularly so people dot feel abanoned
Sep 05 21:30:32 <hertelj1>	I think one thing we really need is a nice letter that we can post or email to people which informs them about Ubuntu and some basic issues involved with installing it
Sep 05 21:30:52 <hertelj1>	I sent out an email last week to my school's classifieds trying to do just that
Sep 05 21:31:08 <hertelj1>	but I think it came off as a little to techie
Sep 05 21:31:16 *	Vorian has quit ()
Sep 05 21:31:39 <hertelj1>	I'm going to make another thread about it, post my original and ask for suggestions
Sep 05 21:32:21 <hertelj1>	I'm not sure if you have ever tried explaining what Ubuntu is to a group of nonusers
Sep 05 21:32:37 <Ek0nomik>	I have.
Sep 05 21:32:41 <hertelj1>	but it can be difficult to do in a few words
Sep 05 21:32:50 <Ek0nomik>	I agree.
Sep 05 21:32:52 <hertelj1>	I often feel like I am preaching :)
Sep 05 21:32:59 <Ek0nomik>	where are you going to school again hertel?
Sep 05 21:33:05 <hertelj1>	an evangelical linux user
Sep 05 21:33:13 <hertelj1>	I am a teacher at Neenah High
Sep 05 21:33:42 <hertelj1>	south of Appleton
Sep 05 21:33:51 <rob-e>	i know where that is
Sep 05 21:34:00 <rob-e>	thats awesome
Sep 05 21:34:19 <rob-e>	i wish my teacher was a linux user
Sep 05 21:34:35 <hertelj1>	Teaching is awesome, but that is a whole different topic. :)
Sep 05 21:34:53 <rob-e>	yeah...
Sep 05 21:35:14 <hertelj1>	OT:  One of the last days of school last year I went off on an opensource/linux tangent.  I think I scared the class.
Sep 05 21:35:24 <hertelj1>	but I felt better
Sep 05 21:35:27 <rob-e>	haha
Sep 05 21:35:32 <MethodOne>	i am thinking of having an installfest for students and staff at lakeshore technical college in cleveland (north of sheboygan, south of manitowoc)
Sep 05 21:35:52 <MethodOne>	i can get help from the linux instructor
Sep 05 21:36:09 <rob-e>	if im not busy id be willing to drive 1.5 hrs proly to help
Sep 05 21:36:12 <hertelj1>	I would be glad to help out
Sep 05 21:36:22 <MethodOne>	i don't know when
Sep 05 21:36:28 <MethodOne>	just an idea
Sep 05 21:36:50 <hertelj1>	Well, if it fits into my schedule I'll make the drive over.
Sep 05 21:37:36 <rob-e>	so when we have one of these how will we advertise?
Sep 05 21:37:38 <MethodOne>	i'll contact the linux instructor if it's possible to do this
Sep 05 21:38:07 <MethodOne>	i'm not very good with graphics or explaining what ubuntu or linux is to a new user
Sep 05 21:38:45 <Ek0nomik>	I would potentially be up for making a drive over too.
Sep 05 21:39:17 <hertelj1>	It can be a real challenge to try and explain something and not drive people away because they think it is too complicated.
Sep 05 21:39:22 <lifewithryan>	could possibly make that drive as well...
Sep 05 21:39:28 *	lifewithryan is back for a quick moment
Sep 05 21:41:16 <Ek0nomik>	heh.
Sep 05 21:41:19 <lifewithryan>	woohoo it validates!
Sep 05 21:41:25 <Ek0nomik>	MethodOne:  you should keep us posted on this.  :)
Sep 05 21:41:30 <MethodOne>	ok
Sep 05 21:41:36 <MethodOne>	i'll do so on the mailing list
Sep 05 21:41:43 <Ek0nomik>	how many students there?
Sep 05 21:41:53 <MethodOne>	i don't know
Sep 05 21:42:12 <Ek0nomik>	you know, with the amount of people here willing to help (method, rob-e, hertel, ryan), I might think about having one on the UW Eau Claire campus.
Sep 05 21:42:33 <Ek0nomik>	I'm not sure where I would host it though
Sep 05 21:42:41 <lifewithryan>	and UW Madison :)
Sep 05 21:42:54 <hertelj1>	That might be fun, my wife would enjoy coming up to see some old friends.
Sep 05 21:42:57 <lifewithryan>	well back out for a bit
Sep 05 21:43:04 *	lifewithryan is gone yet again
Sep 05 21:43:40 <rob-e>	maybe we should think outside schools, maybe like a computer store or something
Sep 05 21:44:18 <hertelj1>	I'm not sure if any of you listen to podcasts much, but I have been listening to a great one that is wonderful for beginning users http://www.linuxreality.com/
Sep 05 21:44:49 <hertelj1>	The host is knowledgeable and entertaining
Sep 05 21:45:16 <hertelj1>	I think it is another great resource for helping people understand what linux is, what ubuntu is, etc
Sep 05 21:46:39 <rob-e>	i just had a thought, does ubuntu have a phrase? like walmarts "always low prices"
Sep 05 21:46:55 <Ek0nomik>	humanity to others is the meaning of Ubuntu I believe.
Sep 05 21:46:58 <rob-e>	i used to listen to podcasts
Sep 05 21:47:13 <rob-e>	yeah, but it sucks ass
Sep 05 21:47:31 <Ek0nomik>	I like it.  :)
Sep 05 21:48:18 <rob-e>	i mean it should be something like "the non microsuck free, secure, OS"
Sep 05 21:48:45 <Ek0nomik>	I disagree.  :P
Sep 05 21:49:42 <rob-e>	well people see "humanity to others" and think o great what the hell does that mean?
Sep 05 21:49:53 <rob-e>	-?
Sep 05 21:49:59 <hertelj1>	Ubuntu is independent of the Microsoft machine
Sep 05 21:50:07 <hertelj1>	it isn't an us vs. them
Sep 05 21:50:45 <rob-e>	but isnt it hertljl? isnt it?
Sep 05 21:50:52 <hertelj1>	I look at it like trying to get people to buy local food or practice conservation
Sep 05 21:51:10 <hertelj1>	it is about choices
Sep 05 21:51:34 <hertelj1>	I think if people understand the possibilities they will be able to make choices that make sense
Sep 05 21:51:47 <hertelj1>	People use windows because it is all they know
Sep 05 21:52:16 <hertelj1>	Maybe if they know about Ubuntu, PCLinuxOS, OpenSuse, etc
Sep 05 21:52:21 <hertelj1>	they will use them instead
Sep 05 21:52:29 <MethodOne>	it would be a good idea to not use the phrases "open source" or "gnu/linux" so people less knowledgeable about computers won't get confused.  those people might not be interested in the source code of the apps on the discs or the repository
Sep 05 21:53:02 <hertelj1>	I know exactly what you mean MethodOne
Sep 05 21:53:05 <Ek0nomik>	I somewhat agree... on the other hand understanding what open source software is about can be powerful in itself.
Sep 05 21:53:14 <Ek0nomik>	that philosophy is what attracted me to linux to begin with.
Sep 05 21:53:20 <hertelj1>	my problem in writing the letter I sent was that I did know how far I could break it down
Sep 05 21:53:50 <hertelj1>	at some point you have to talk about opensource
Sep 05 21:54:04 <MethodOne>	ok
Sep 05 21:54:10 <rob-e>	"linux is no longer just for geeks"
Sep 05 21:54:16 <hertelj1>	:)
Sep 05 21:54:19 <MethodOne>	good
Sep 05 21:54:40 <hertelj1>	That would be a funny bumper sticker
Sep 05 21:54:55 <hertelj1>	well, to about 10% of the population anyway
Sep 05 21:58:02 <Ek0nomik>	I need a linux bumper sticker.
Sep 05 21:58:54 <rob-e>	there we go guys, the next great idea
Sep 05 21:59:31 <hertelj1>	I ordered free CD from canonical and they sent me four free stickers
Sep 05 22:00:13 <hertelj1>	They say:  Ubuntu - Linux for human beings
Sep 05 22:00:26 <hertelj1>	Not exactly bumper sticker material
Sep 05 22:00:35 <Ek0nomik>	yeah, I have those too.
Sep 05 22:00:39 <Ek0nomik>	I put one on my laptop.
Sep 05 22:00:43 <MethodOne>	me too
Sep 05 22:00:57 <rob-e>	i want one... sob
Sep 05 22:01:26 <hertelj1>	Just order a free cd
Sep 05 22:01:34 <rob-e>	but i dont need 1
Sep 05 22:01:37 <hertelj1>	and in a month (or two) they will arrive
Sep 05 22:01:49 <hertelj1>	give it as a gift to someone who will use it
Sep 05 22:02:36 <rob-e>	okay, did neone ever install from a flash drive?
Sep 05 22:02:41 <rob-e>	is it faster?
Sep 05 22:02:59 <Ek0nomik>	well, I have some things I need to take care of still tonight.
Sep 05 22:03:11 <MethodOne>	you can order a pack of 20 for $40 at shop.canonical.com.  it's probably faster that way
Sep 05 22:03:23 <Ek0nomik>	I will update the Wiki/Forum about the second meeting later tonight.
Sep 05 22:03:36 <Ek0nomik>	I'll keep logging incase you guys shoot more ideas around.
Sep 05 22:03:45 <rob-e>	okay c ya
Sep 05 22:03:46 <hertelj1>	alright, nice chatting with you
Sep 05 22:03:59 <Ek0nomik>	you too, it was good to talk with you guys again.
Sep 05 22:04:04 <rob-e>	yep
Sep 05 22:04:18 <Ek0nomik>	I'll be on the forum more now that I am settled back at school again.  :P
Sep 05 22:09:34 <rob-e>	u guys see the linux ati driver    http://linux.slashdot.org/linux/07/09/05/1328225.shtml
Sep 05 22:10:06 <rob-e>	i know what graphics card im getting in my next box
Sep 05 22:12:11 <MethodOne>	now i don't have to worry about graphics performance on the current imacs (they have ati chips)
Sep 05 22:12:20 <MethodOne>	in linux
Sep 05 22:12:26 <rob-e>	yeah
Sep 05 22:12:40 <hertelj1>	I can't say I am a super hardware guy, but it is good to see the shift in focus towards linux
Sep 05 22:13:22 <rob-e>	yeah, now hopefully the competators will have to do the same to not loose business
Sep 05 22:16:10 <hertelj1>	I'm going to sign off, it was nice chatting with you all.
Sep 05 22:16:22 <rob-e>	k
Sep 05 22:16:26 <rob-e>	ttyl
Sep 05 22:16:50 *	hertelj1 (n=herteljt@CPE-67-48-251-23.new.res.rr.com) has left #ubuntu-wisconsin
Sep 05 22:19:14 <rob-e>	sooooooo
Sep 05 22:19:21 <Ek0nomik>	so.  :)
Sep 05 22:19:30 <lifewithryan>	back again for a few
Sep 05 22:20:17 <rob-e>	whats next on the agenda?
Sep 05 22:20:25 <lifewithryan>	for a saying how about Ubuntu, it does porn too?
Sep 05 22:20:28 <lifewithryan>	*kidding*
Sep 05 22:20:40 <Ek0nomik>	don't joke about that.
Sep 05 22:20:41 <Ek0nomik>	;)
Sep 05 22:20:55 <Ek0nomik>	rob-e:  I think our agenda is clean for the evening.
Sep 05 22:21:02 <Ek0nomik>	We'll have another meeting in 2 weeks.
Sep 05 22:21:43 <rob-e>	do we even have a written agenda?
Sep 05 22:21:59 <lifewithryan>	i don't think we had one for this week did we?
Sep 05 22:22:01 <Ek0nomik>	we did for the first meeting.
Sep 05 22:22:05 <Ek0nomik>	this week was kinda random.
Sep 05 22:22:22 <Ek0nomik>	it was worthwhile though.
Sep 05 22:22:26 <lifewithryan>	we have a start for one next week: pick a person/team to head up getting a website going
Sep 05 22:22:49 <Ek0nomik>	agreed.
Sep 05 22:22:53 <MethodOne>	ok
Sep 05 22:23:07 <rob-e>	ya
Sep 05 22:23:14 <lifewithryan>	as always more ideas for spreading the word
Sep 05 22:24:53 <lifewithryan>	perhaps we should also start creating "screencasts" of frequently asked questions on the different newbie forums
Sep 05 22:25:08 <lifewithryan>	and host them on the website as well
Sep 05 22:25:17 <rob-e>	i like that
Sep 05 22:25:48 <rob-e>	but it would have to be for things too complicated to easily explain, and relitevly common
Sep 05 22:25:49 <lifewithryan>	also, i'm a big fan of the command line...most ppl are afraid to go there
Sep 05 22:26:16 <rob-e>	perhaps a first time user video showing them around too
Sep 05 22:26:23 <lifewithryan>	i agree rob, however with some folks just seeing it would be so much more help.
Sep 05 22:26:47 <rob-e>	ya
Sep 05 22:26:53 <lifewithryan>	no matter how easy...plus its the added advantage of letting a newbie "poke around" without having to "poke around"
Sep 05 22:26:56 <lifewithryan>	if you follow me
Sep 05 22:27:36 <lifewithryan>	the first person i introduced to linux wasn't interested until he saw it for the first time...he said "THIS is LINUX?!?"
Sep 05 22:27:41 <lifewithryan>	he hasnt' looked back since
Sep 05 22:27:47 <rob-e>	yeah
Sep 05 22:27:51 <rob-e>	i agree
Sep 05 22:27:56 <lifewithryan>	just a thought
Sep 05 22:28:09 <lifewithryan>	i have them sometimes ;)
Sep 05 22:28:12 <rob-e>	people think it looks like windows 95
Sep 05 22:28:20 <rob-e>	i used to neways
Sep 05 22:28:26 <lifewithryan>	heh, yeah i heard that before
Sep 05 22:28:32 <rob-e>	before i saw the light
Sep 05 22:28:56 <lifewithryan>	but any OS with the "Desktop" approach is going to look like that
Sep 05 22:29:06 <rob-e>	and espically with gutsy having beryl type things by default... people will drool all over
Sep 05 22:29:07 <lifewithryan>	(well OSX has done some pretty innovative things)
Sep 05 22:29:21 <lifewithryan>	*sigh* dancing hippos again ;)
Sep 05 22:29:39 <rob-e>	...
Sep 05 22:29:50 <lifewithryan>	sorry rob, from an eariler conversation
Sep 05 22:30:01 <rob-e>	ohh
Sep 05 22:30:25 <lifewithryan>	and was more web-design related, not OS related
Sep 05 22:31:03 <lifewithryan>	but in all honesty, yea the eye candy is cool but its just that...eye candy
Sep 05 22:31:20 <lifewithryan>	the stuff I use is the window transparency and the expose effect...
Sep 05 22:31:28 <lifewithryan>	that's really about it...
Sep 05 22:32:08 <rob-e>	dont you read lifehacker... they say it makes you more productive, having 4 vrtual desktops in a cube
Sep 05 22:32:14 <lifewithryan>	don't get me wrong...i love it
Sep 05 22:32:37 <lifewithryan>	i don't see how having them on a cube makes me more productive than just clicking to go to that workspace
Sep 05 22:32:53 <lifewithryan>	ctrl + alt + arrow key
Sep 05 22:32:56 <rob-e>	yeam +1
Sep 05 22:33:35 <lifewithryan>	the transparency however...being able to debug code in one app while watching log messages in a terminal window behind that app...man...thats useful
Sep 05 22:33:36 <rob-e>	but the thing is it sells (for free)... my sister only installed it for beryl to show off to friends, now, 2 months later shes teaching me things
Sep 05 22:33:56 <lifewithryan>	lol...yeah its a good interest grabber thats for sure
Sep 05 22:34:01 <rob-e>	yeah
Sep 05 22:34:15 <lifewithryan>	(my dancing hippos analogy) the client will always choose "dancing hippos" over a rich feature set
Sep 05 22:34:29 <rob-e>	anyhoooooooooooo  we SHOULD have video tuts
Sep 05 22:34:39 <rob-e>	haha
Sep 05 22:34:39 <lifewithryan>	totally agree
Sep 05 22:35:24 <lifewithryan>	oh and back to the command line...how does everyone here feel about using it? hate it? love it? etc?
Sep 05 22:35:46 <rob-e>	love it for doing everything cept running programs
Sep 05 22:35:59 <lifewithryan>	same here...
Sep 05 22:36:05 <rob-e>	although technically thats all it mosty does
Sep 05 22:36:20 <lifewithryan>	i love bash scripts, and sed, awk, grep, find etc
Sep 05 22:36:29 <lifewithryan>	some powerful shiznitikus there
Sep 05 22:36:42 <rob-e>	yep, sadly im a termnal noob
Sep 05 22:36:49 *	uberushaximus (n=uberusha@68-114-243-20.dhcp.fdul.wi.charter.com) has joined #ubuntu-wisconsin
Sep 05 22:36:56 <lifewithryan>	i use some form of "for blah in something do" everyday
Sep 05 22:37:04 <MethodOne>	i don't do very well with bash scripting.
Sep 05 22:37:19 <lifewithryan>	man...i highly recommend getting to learn it
Sep 05 22:37:32 <lifewithryan>	and learn vi or emacs too
Sep 05 22:37:43 <lifewithryan>	i love vi
Sep 05 22:37:56 <MethodOne>	i know stuff about vi, but not about emacs
Sep 05 22:38:15 <lifewithryan>	same here, i'd say i'm a power user with vi...rarely use emacs
Sep 05 22:38:41 <lifewithryan>	unles someone at work forgets to EXPORT EDITOR=vi for everyone's profile
Sep 05 22:38:54 <lifewithryan>	(but thats more a solaris thing I think)
Sep 05 22:39:12 <lifewithryan>	perhaps its Ubuntu's default as well but i've changed it on my system
Sep 05 22:39:46 <lifewithryan>	hey uber...you in fon du lac?
Sep 05 22:40:18 <uberushaximus>	my IP is, however no

Sep 05 22:47:37 <uberushaximus>	also, sorry about my lack of presence tonight
Sep 05 22:47:48 <uberushaximus>	we didn't have a meeting, did we?
Sep 05 22:47:49 <lifewithryan>	no worries...hardly anyone here tonight
Sep 05 22:48:02 <uberushaximus>	it was meeting night after all >_>
Sep 05 22:48:02 <lifewithryan>	it was sort of /dev/random if you know what I mean
Sep 05 22:48:32 <rob-e>	~ = noone
Sep 05 22:48:48 <rob-e>	hehe linux jukes time
Sep 05 22:49:09 <rob-e>	jukes=jokes
Sep 05 22:49:14 <lifewithryan>	basically we just talked about the need or lack of need for a website, what sorta stuff to put on one, and more ideas of getting the word out
Sep 05 22:49:50 <uberushaximus>	I should talk to jacobmp92 or Ek0nomik for a server
Sep 05 22:50:08 <lifewithryan>	i can host it i think
Sep 05 22:52:37 <lifewithryan>	the question is, do we register a new domain name or just piggy back it somewhere?  if we register a new one, we have to decide who/how to pay for it etc.
Sep 05 22:52:56 <lifewithryan>	i've offered to host it for free
Sep 05 22:53:08 <uberushaximus>	I've already had offers
Sep 05 22:53:08 <lifewithryan>	as long as it doesn't get too busy or something
Sep 05 22:53:19 <uberushaximus>	I have to see has the best bandwidth
Sep 05 22:53:26 <lifewithryan>	oh sweet...whatcha got?
Sep 05 22:53:37 <MethodOne>	i have 3Mbps
Sep 05 22:53:51 <MethodOne>	dsl from tds telecom
Sep 05 22:53:56 <uberushaximus>	bleh
Sep 05 22:54:06 <uberushaximus>	that's residential
Sep 05 22:54:10 <lifewithryan>	well i resell hosting so my servers are at a colo in orlando
Sep 05 22:54:25 <uberushaximus>	and 3 mbps max down you mean ;)
Sep 05 22:54:29 <MethodOne>	ok
Sep 05 22:54:37 <lifewithryan>	though i must say they're not as fast as i'd like to see them be
Sep 05 22:54:47 <MethodOne>	sorry
Sep 05 22:54:50 <lifewithryan>	then again, how much bandwidth are we anticipating?
Sep 05 22:55:08 <uberushaximus>	well, I don't really know
Sep 05 22:55:19 <uberushaximus>	it'd be nice to get a little traffic
Sep 05 22:55:19 <rob-e>	ok guys ill see ya i got work tommorow
Sep 05 22:55:24 <lifewithryan>	later rob
Sep 05 22:55:31 <rob-e>	yep
Sep 05 22:55:34 <rob-e>	bi
Sep 05 22:55:36 *	rob-e has quit ("Leaving")
Sep 05 22:57:07 <lifewithryan>	sure would be nice to get traffic
Sep 05 22:57:22 <lifewithryan>	but then again, we're not trying to replace Ubuntu.com or the forums with this thing right?
Sep 05 22:57:42 <lifewithryan>	but hell, if you've got a place to host with good bandwidth and free...guess ya can't beat that
Sep 05 22:57:42 <MethodOne>	i have to go
Sep 05 22:57:52 <MethodOne>	bye
Sep 05 22:57:53 <lifewithryan>	later mo
Sep 05 22:57:54 <uberushaximus>	no, it's simply a portal with possibly a team news blog
Sep 05 22:57:59 <lifewithryan>	right
Sep 05 22:58:00 *	MethodOne has quit ("Leaving")
Sep 05 22:58:03 <uberushaximus>	in my theory
Sep 05 22:58:07 <lifewithryan>	thats what i was saying earlier too
Sep 05 22:58:13 <lifewithryan>	so i think we're on the same page there
Sep 05 22:59:45 <lifewithryan>	i could see us hosting some possible screencast tutorials on there too....eventually
Sep 05 23:00:17 <lifewithryan>	so *that* would be a bandwidth hog potentially
Sep 05 23:02:41 <lifewithryan>	well, i gotta crash too...work tomorrow....night man}}}
