__TOC__

== The WartyWarthog Kernel ==

We want a single Linux kernel source package which:

* Builds kernel images for all Warty architectures
* Includes some third-party drivers in the source tree
* Includes value-add patches as necessary
* Uses a package name based on "linux" rather than "kernel"
* Has patches separated individually by purpose

Goals of the kernel:

* ability to boot on almost any hardware, so including binary drivers if necessary
* stability is more important than performance
* closeness to upstream is highly valued, ideally it should be upstream plus a set of distinct well known patches

== Patches ==

* EVMS bd-claim patch: kernel-patch-evms, or evms-2.3.4/kernel/2.6/bd-claim.patch (for <nowiki>[[https://bugzilla.warthogs.hbd.com/warty-bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=313|Bug#313]]</nowiki>)
* MPPE patch (Microsoft VPN support): http://pptpclient.sourceforge.net/
* mlock-as-user patches from -mm kernel
* ipv6 stateful firewall from USAGI (note: it requires also a new iptables package)
* mISDN: http://www.isdn4linux.de/mISDN/

== Drivers ==

This is a proposed list of external kernel drivers that we want to ship with WartyWarthog.

Each driver needs to be available for kernel 2.6, since we will only support a bare-bones 2.4
as a fallback for conservative server-oriented users (as discussed on the mailing list already).

We are willing to ship ndiswrapper and binary drivers written for Windows as long as they are binary-redistributable.

Please add drivers that you are aware of, that are worth shipping.  If corresponding userland tools are required, add them to the PROPOSED section on WartyWarthog/SupportedSeed.

=== Networking ===

Definitive WiFi page is: http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Jean_Tourrilhes/Linux/Linux.Wireless.drivers.802.11b.html
* madwifi
** driver and firmware for Atheros-based wireless cards
** http://madwifi.sourceforge.net/
* ipw2100
** driver for Intel PRO/Wireless cards used in Centrino laptops
** http://ipw2100.sourceforge.net/
* ipw2200
** driver for Intel PRO/Wireless cards used in Centrino laptops
** http://ipw2200.sourceforge.net
** Not ready yet, but <nowiki>[[http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=5179147&forum_id=38938|could be quite soon]]</nowiki>, and we want as soon as it is ready
* linux-wlan-ng
** driver for Prism2 USB cards (e. g. Netgear MA-111)
** ftp://ftp.linux-wlan.org/pub/linux-wlan-ng/
** 0.2.1pre21 compiles and works nicely with current 2.6.7 kernel (stable 0.2.0 does not compile)
** userspace is nasty according to mdz; our kernels support it now, but probably defer userspace to [obsoleted by HoaryHedgehog / HoaryGoals]
* prism54
** driver is in 2.6.7 and newer.  Needed for at least newer 3com cards
** http://prism54.org/~mcgrof/firmware/ has the needed firmware.
** TollefFogHeen: I'm not sure about the legal status wrt redistribution, but that should be possible to find out.
** Reportedly, firmware is not freely redistributable, but we may ask for permission
* TI ACX111
** there's a capital-F-Free driver out there
** only works for some chipsets
* Broadcom
** completely non-Free, needs ndisloader (sorry)

* what kind of drivers do things like Broadcomm, Linksys, Netgear etc. use?  Pretty much every 11g card has binary firmware or similar. DanielStone: Broadcomm cards need ndisloader (we can ship this, just not the drivers) and the drivers from the CD, hence my proposal to have a really nasty horrible daemon that says 'hi! you just inserted a CD with drivers for your wireless card; want to install them?'. I think Netgears are usually one of Atheros, Prism, or TI ACX111.

* There is a <nowiki>[[http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/List|list]]</nowiki> that specifies many of the ndiswrapper drivers. Don't know which of them are allowed to be binary-redistributable, but couldn't the installation/configuration just download the file from the source as given on that page if we aren't allowed to redistribute it?

=== Webcams ===

* PWCX 9 Philips Webcam drivers http://www.smcc.demon.nl/webcam/

=== ISDN ===

* Build the old ISDN drivers in the kernel, not enabled by default.

* AVM drivers using the CAPI interface (non-free, need to find out distribution terms).
