Aug 22 19:59:01 <Th3_D0ct0R>	hey ekonomic
Aug 22 19:59:09 <herteljt>	terrible with all the flooding
Aug 22 19:59:10 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	I thought uber was going to make it so I want to give him a few minutes.
Aug 22 19:59:11 <Th3_D0ct0R>	na im up here in the northern part
Aug 22 19:59:18 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	hert:  Madison.
Aug 22 19:59:20 <Th3_D0ct0R>	its only 8
Aug 22 19:59:28 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	A lot of our neighbors have had flooding.
Aug 22 19:59:33 <herteljt>	I heard that a few people were killed in madison today
Aug 22 19:59:41 <herteljt>	lighting hitting water
Aug 22 19:59:43 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	yep.
Aug 22 19:59:49 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	I think it was a poll actually.
Aug 22 19:59:52 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	that fell into the water.
Aug 22 20:00:05 <Th3_D0ct0R>	wow that sucks
Aug 22 20:00:10 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	uberushaximus:  you around?
Aug 22 20:00:18 <uberushaximus>	yup
Aug 22 20:00:23 <uberushaximus>	Greetings
Aug 22 20:00:25 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	excellent.
Aug 22 20:00:28 <uberushaximus>	Welcome to our first meeting
Aug 22 20:00:38 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	Anyone know who Mike Putnam is?  He added himself to the Wiki.
Aug 22 20:00:41 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	I was just wondering who he was.
Aug 22 20:00:44 <herteljt>	Glad to be here
Aug 22 20:01:19 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	Well, I have a rather lax agenda for us to discuss:
Aug 22 20:01:21 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	* Regular Meeting Time Scheduling
Aug 22 20:01:21 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	* Wisconsin Wiki Discussion
Aug 22 20:01:21 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	* Website & Launchpad Ideas
Aug 22 20:01:21 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	* Project Ideas in Wisconsin
Aug 22 20:01:21 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	* Mailing List Ideas/Management
Aug 22 20:01:36 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	So, we can begin withh 1:  Regular Meeting Time.
Aug 22 20:01:49 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	Anyone think it will be possible for our group of people here?
Aug 22 20:01:49 <uberushaximus>	I can't necessarily make /every/ meeting, as I have a job
Aug 22 20:01:58 <Th3_D0ct0R>	umm  a sec i gotta go nuke my food but ill be back
Aug 22 20:02:06 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	lol, alright d0ct0R.  :)
Aug 22 20:02:12 <Th3_D0ct0R>	jutalkin ill come back into the convo when im ready
Aug 22 20:02:30 <herteljt>	Evenings work best for me
Aug 22 20:02:35 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	uber:  That's fine, I was just thinking a regular time for at least 3 people to be present.
Aug 22 20:02:51 <herteljt>	Tuesday is the only evening that won't work regularly
Aug 22 20:02:52 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	herteljt:  Same here, I will have lectures starting September 4.
Aug 22 20:03:09 <uberushaximus>	so that rules out tuesday
Aug 22 20:03:20 <herteljt>	Wednesday is good
Aug 22 20:03:30 <MethodOne>	that's good
Aug 22 20:03:37 <herteljt>	a nice middle of the week day
Aug 22 20:04:13 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	Wednesday will work for me too.
Aug 22 20:04:21 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	I have lab until 4:45, but that seems early enough anyways.
Aug 22 20:04:25 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	Wedneday nights?
Aug 22 20:04:32 <uberushaximus>	it worked this week
Aug 22 20:05:11 <herteljt>	When I was in college Wednesday evenings was the best day for meetings that is why I suggested it
Aug 22 20:05:34 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	It will definitely work for me.
Aug 22 20:05:43 <herteljt>	Let's say Wednesday 8pm
Aug 22 20:05:55 <MethodOne>	ok
Aug 22 20:05:56 <herteljt>	as our #1 choice
Aug 22 20:06:02 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	I think that should be fine.  Let's just see what D0ct0R says.
Aug 22 20:06:05 <uberushaximus>	any objections?
Aug 22 20:06:18 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	Once more thing on the meeting topic... how many times a month?
Aug 22 20:06:22 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	once, twice?
Aug 22 20:06:42 <uberushaximus>	why not bi or quadmonthly?
Aug 22 20:06:53 <herteljt>	it depends on what we are doing
Aug 22 20:07:36 <herteljt>	one advantage our little group has is that we have a message board which is checked regularly
Aug 22 20:07:54 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	definitely.
Aug 22 20:08:07 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	I check it once a day at least.
Aug 22 20:08:25 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	uberushaximus:  You think twice a month?
Aug 22 20:08:50 <uberushaximus>	twice does seem more than enough for our priorities
Aug 22 20:08:53 <uberushaximus>	so sure
Aug 22 20:09:00 <Th3_D0ct0R>	i have church choir till 730-ish and then theres always socializing til like 745 so i should be able to make it at 8 maybe a lil later
Aug 22 20:09:01 <herteljt>	I would agree
Aug 22 20:09:16 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	I agree, I think twice could possibly even be more than enough for us.
Aug 22 20:09:28 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	I don't think our agenda would always be as large as this one.
Aug 22 20:09:42 <herteljt>	if anything regular meetings will keep us honest
Aug 22 20:09:54 <herteljt>	and on top of our resonsibilities
Aug 22 20:09:59 <Th3_D0ct0R>	yea something to chekc up on our prgress
Aug 22 20:10:01 <herteljt>	responsibilities
Aug 22 20:10:11 <sgtd>	Wednesday @ 8:00pm works for me too.

Aug 22 20:10:38 <herteljt>	k
Aug 22 20:10:41 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	I will update the Wiki later tonight too.
Aug 22 20:10:57 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	So, twice a month seems good for everyone?
Aug 22 20:11:05 <Th3_D0ct0R>	yea
Aug 22 20:11:10 <MethodOne>	ok
Aug 22 20:11:15 <herteljt>	sounds good

Aug 22 20:12:19 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	I'll put a reminder in my phone.  :)
Aug 22 20:12:23 <Th3_D0ct0R>	second day of school fo me
Aug 22 20:12:34 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	Second day for everyone in Wisconsin I think.
Aug 22 20:12:45 <herteljt>	yes, our legislature made sure of that
Aug 22 20:12:51 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	so our kids can work at the Dells.
Aug 22 20:12:54 <herteljt>	the private schools can start early
Aug 22 20:12:58 <Th3_D0ct0R>	oh yea :)
Aug 22 20:13:25 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	I wish I could get the Soup Nazi to say "Next!" after we finish every item on our agenda.
Aug 22 20:13:32 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	* Wisconsin Wiki Discussion *
Aug 22 20:13:42 <uberushaximus>	good episode
Aug 22 20:13:59 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	I reworked the Wiki page (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WisconsinTeam - if you haven't seen it)
Aug 22 20:14:20 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	I have uberushaximus and myself on the Member list.  Any of you can add yourself at any time if you wish.
Aug 22 20:15:20 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	I don't know if any of you thought additional pages should be create, or something changed.
Aug 22 20:15:23 <Th3_D0ct0R>	it lookes good
Aug 22 20:15:48 <herteljt>	clean and simple
Aug 22 20:15:51 <uberushaximus>	that it does
Aug 22 20:16:07 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	If anything comes to mind, just shoot me a message or clean up any messy errors I made.  :)
Aug 22 20:16:13 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	or just create a page if you wish.
Aug 22 20:16:19 <Th3_D0ct0R>	yea alrighty
Aug 22 20:16:53 <uberushaximus>	NEXT!
Aug 22 20:16:58 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	lol.
Aug 22 20:16:59 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	* Website & Launchpad Ideas *
Aug 22 20:17:13 *	Ek0nomik|Laptop personally doesn't use Launchpad very often at all.
Aug 22 20:17:24 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	A website could be worthwhile though.
Aug 22 20:17:30 *	uberushaximus used to but has been drawn away from it
Aug 22 20:17:37 *	uberushaximus realizes he has a hat on
Aug 22 20:17:52 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	life aquatic style?
Aug 22 20:17:54 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	:P
Aug 22 20:17:58 <herteljt>	My questions would be:
Aug 22 20:17:59 *	uberushaximus is easily distracted
Aug 22 20:18:05 <herteljt>	1) what is on the site?
Aug 22 20:18:11 <herteljt>	2) who maintains the site?
Aug 22 20:18:27 <uberushaximus>	Ek0nomik already suggested to maintain
Aug 22 20:18:41 <uberushaximus>	did you not?
Aug 22 20:19:04 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	herteljt:  Honestly, I think #1 would be very similar to the Wiki.  It would just look nicer.
Aug 22 20:19:18 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	2:  I am looking for VERY low maintenance if we were to have one.
Aug 22 20:19:20 <Th3_D0ct0R>	yea and we could and a bunch of nifty little touches
Aug 22 20:19:38 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	I can maintain it, but keeping that in mind, I would keep everything VERY simple.
Aug 22 20:19:43 <herteljt>	Would it be for communication with people outside the group?
Aug 22 20:19:51 <Th3_D0ct0R>	yes and no
Aug 22 20:19:53 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	I would use Wordpress for "blogging" (updated), and then just throw a design together.
Aug 22 20:19:58 <sgtd>	could it be stated that wiki is for LoCo Team stuffs and Lanchpad site is primarily to attract/engage new Ubuntu users?
Aug 22 20:20:00 <uberushaximus>	why not be a portal newsblog?
Aug 22 20:20:35 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	uberushaximus:  You are saying the website could be a news blog?
Aug 22 20:20:50 <uberushaximus>	mhmm
Aug 22 20:20:53 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	sgtd:  Do you think Launchpad makes for a good initial greeting to the group?
Aug 22 20:20:57 *	zombiechick wonders why there is a need for a distro-specific advocacy group...
Aug 22 20:21:02 <uberushaximus>	similar to planet.pidgin.im
Aug 22 20:21:11 <sgtd>	With Forums/Wiki/and Lanchpad, I forsee an unhealthy spread of un-updated resources.
Aug 22 20:21:24 <sgtd>	zombiechick: why not?
Aug 22 20:21:47 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	zombiechick:  You have an odd channel choice then.  :)
Aug 22 20:21:52 <zombiechick>	sgtd: I have been an avocate of most distro's at one time or another...
Aug 22 20:21:53 <sgtd>	Linux! With a bias!
Aug 22 20:21:55 <herteljt>	zombiechick: Everyone has to start somewhere
Aug 22 20:22:07 <herteljt>	what a strange comment
Aug 22 20:22:09 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	sgtd:  I absolutely agree, and that's why I am saying very low maintenance.
Aug 22 20:22:25 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	The website would need to be *easy* to update.
Aug 22 20:22:46 <herteljt>	a blog would work nicely
Aug 22 20:22:55 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	I have setup my own blog w/ Wordpress.
Aug 22 20:22:55 <zombiechick>	I just wonder if all this energy would be better put into a distro-neutral Linux advocacy group
Aug 22 20:23:15 <sgtd>	Perhaps we could step back and assert what this LoCo is all about.  Evangelize? Socialize? etc?
Aug 22 20:23:16 *	zombiechick will shut up now..
Aug 22 20:23:20 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	zombiechick:  Getting someone interested in a single distro is enough to push them to another.
Aug 22 20:23:33 <herteljt>	I agree that is the point of the group
Aug 22 20:23:44 <herteljt>	try ubuntu and if you like it try something else
Aug 22 20:24:22 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	sgtd:  The purpose of the LoCo is advocation and socialization imo.
Aug 22 20:24:31 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	Advocate while having fun.
Aug 22 20:24:40 <herteljt>	I think advocate
Aug 22 20:25:14 *	zombiechick is now known as zombiechick-here
Aug 22 20:25:24 *	zombiechick-here is now known as hereti1
Aug 22 20:25:35 <sgtd>	i see my "membership" as an evangelical one, the social part will follow anyway.
Aug 22 20:25:36 <hereti1>	rofl...
Aug 22 20:25:54 <herteljt>	I also think evangelical
Aug 22 20:26:04 <herteljt>	but I don't see myself "pushing" others into it
Aug 22 20:26:08 <uberushaximus>	I think pushing ease of use and easy migration is a must
Aug 22 20:26:12 *	hereti1 is now known as zombiechick
Aug 22 20:26:16 *	Ek0nomik|Laptop agrees with uber.
Aug 22 20:26:16 <Th3_D0ct0R>	yea
Aug 22 20:26:20 <herteljt>	although I did change my mother's pc over
Aug 22 20:26:24 <sgtd>	!pushing, rather "making aware"
Aug 22 20:26:33 <sgtd>	My wife runs Ubuntu.
Aug 22 20:26:50 <sgtd>	My kids run Ubuntu (when they don't want to play Win-only games)
Aug 22 20:26:56 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	My roomates now run Ubuntu, and my girlfriend will soon as well.
Aug 22 20:27:05 <sgtd>	I run Ubuntu for casual-use laptops
Aug 22 20:27:44 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	primary distro?
Aug 22 20:27:54 <herteljt>	what were were talking about?
Aug 22 20:27:56 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	Ok, so, shall we put the website discussion off for another time?
Aug 22 20:28:11 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	let the idea get chewed on a bit for the next meeting?
Aug 22 20:28:18 <MethodOne>	ok
Aug 22 20:28:19 <sgtd>	Whether or not advocacy is the primary goal of the LoCo, I would vote that the Launchpad be used primarily for that.
Aug 22 20:28:52 <herteljt>	yes, let's put it off for the next meeting
Aug 22 20:29:16 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	* Project Ideas in Wisconsin *
Aug 22 20:29:23 <sgtd>	and the wiki for "Team" stuff.  a la "point gramma to Launchpad, point techno-buddies interested in participating to wiki"
Aug 22 20:30:15 <Th3_D0ct0R>	what have other loco groups done?
Aug 22 20:30:25 <sgtd>	<shrug>
Aug 22 20:30:31 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	many have websites if I am not mistaken.
Aug 22 20:30:34 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	and launchpad as well.
Aug 22 20:30:59 <Th3_D0ct0R>	so they just encourage ppl to use ubuntu/linux?
Aug 22 20:31:00 <sgtd>	I can offer a subdomain of wisconsinlinux.org to the group.
Aug 22 20:31:20 <sgtd>	Th3_D0ct0R: but with Local relavence.
Aug 22 20:31:20 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	sgtd:  Thanks for the offer.  :)  I think we should just chew on the idea for now.
Aug 22 20:31:46 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	we can discuss the website more at the next meeting.
Aug 22 20:31:52 <sgtd>	<tabled>
Aug 22 20:32:10 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	uberushaximus has control over the Launchpad.
Aug 22 20:32:15 <herteljt>	I agree with the gentlemen from wisconsin
Aug 22 20:32:24 <uberushaximus>	is there any changes needed?
Aug 22 20:32:59 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	Just a photo I think.
Aug 22 20:33:05 <uberushaximus>	of?
Aug 22 20:33:07 <uberushaximus>	the logo?
Aug 22 20:33:19 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	sure.
Aug 22 20:33:30 <sgtd>	herteljt: olz
Aug 22 20:34:02 <herteljt>	olz?
Aug 22 20:34:11 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	Does anyone have any initial project ideas for us to think about?
Aug 22 20:34:15 <sgtd>	multiple lol's perhaps
Aug 22 20:34:24 <herteljt>	oh :)
Aug 22 20:34:51 <herteljt>	here is one I had
Aug 22 20:34:58 <herteljt>	a setup day of some sort
Aug 22 20:35:09 <sgtd>	an installfest?
Aug 22 20:35:13 <herteljt>	yep
Aug 22 20:35:26 <MethodOne>	that would be good
Aug 22 20:35:32 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	yes, yes it would.
Aug 22 20:35:47 <sgtd>	could we leverage any regional LUG's?
Aug 22 20:35:48 <herteljt>	maybe we could advertise at different places and help people setup systems
Aug 22 20:35:51 <uberushaximus>	sgtd: would you be interested in seeing if we can work that into the wilug installfest?
Aug 22 20:36:14 <sgtd>	!wilug!! is having an installfest?!
Aug 22 20:36:31 <uberushaximus>	I assumed they would?
Aug 22 20:36:33 <uberushaximus>	:/
Aug 22 20:37:06 <sgtd>	#wilug is very geographically diverse.
Aug 22 20:37:15 <uberushaximus>	are we not?
Aug 22 20:37:35 <sgtd>	yes.  but #wilug hasn't done an installfest either
Aug 22 20:37:59 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	I don't think we can get any conclusions out of this yet.  We need to communicate more with other LUG's in WI to set this up.
Aug 22 20:38:04 <herteljt>	should we contact wilug and maybe a few other lugs in wisconsin?
Aug 22 20:38:23 <sgtd>	yes.
Aug 22 20:38:41 <herteljt>	http://www.newlug.org/index.php/Main_Page#Linux_Links
Aug 22 20:38:46 <herteljt>	that is newlug
Aug 22 20:38:53 <sgtd>	I think existing LUGS may think it a bit of a waste of time.
Aug 22 20:38:55 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	yeah, we need to discuss with other LUG's more.
Aug 22 20:38:57 <herteljt>	north eastern wisconsin
Aug 22 20:39:08 <sgtd>	it would be tricky to get buy-in without being dismissed.
Aug 22 20:39:26 <uberushaximus>	launchpad logo'd
Aug 22 20:39:28 <sgtd>	http://wisconsinlinux.org has pretty full list of the groups in WI.
Aug 22 20:39:35 <uberushaximus>	https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-us-wisconsin
Aug 22 20:40:23 <herteljt>	well, how about this
Aug 22 20:40:23 <sgtd>	regardless, a healthy relationship with local LUG's can only be good.
Aug 22 20:40:32 <herteljt>	we plan an install fest
Aug 22 20:40:33 <uberushaximus>	sgtd: Indeed
Aug 22 20:40:36 *	Ek0nomik|Laptop agrees with sgtd.
Aug 22 20:40:45 <herteljt>	and invite them to participate
Aug 22 20:41:21 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	Ideally the install fest would be not in the Winter.  :/
Aug 22 20:41:25 <uberushaximus>	but, please, don't elt it become a my distro is better than yours
Aug 22 20:41:29 <sgtd>	and don't take it personally when you encounter skepticism
Aug 22 20:41:32 <uberushaximus>	*let
Aug 22 20:41:39 <MethodOne>	that would be good, but i don't want to drive an hour or two to get to the nearest lug.  i live in howards grove (near sheboygan)
Aug 22 20:42:07 <herteljt>	I think we need to approach this from the standpoint that any linux is better than no linux
Aug 22 20:42:12 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	yep.
Aug 22 20:42:33 <sgtd>	yes.
Aug 22 20:42:46 <uberushaximus>	and not to get into any flamewars with other distro users
Aug 22 20:42:56 <herteljt>	from our conversation here and on the forum i don't think any of us feels that Ubuntu is the one, the only distro
Aug 22 20:43:28 <uberushaximus>	that's a good sentiment
Aug 22 20:43:35 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	yep.
Aug 22 20:44:14 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	Alright, another item to be chewed on and discussed later.
Aug 22 20:44:21 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	We need to communicate with LUG's more.
Aug 22 20:44:26 <herteljt>	I don't think the install fest has to be in only one place (though it would be helpful to have more than one person for trouble shooting)
Aug 22 20:44:33 <uberushaximus>	mhmm
Aug 22 20:44:47 <uberushaximus>	multiple simultaneous installs
Aug 22 20:44:54 <uberushaximus>	in different locations
Aug 22 20:45:55 <MethodOne>	how can i advertise the install fest to current and new linux users in my area?
Aug 22 20:46:09 <uberushaximus>	We'll get to that
Aug 22 20:46:11 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	yeah.
Aug 22 20:46:14 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	We can design posters.
Aug 22 20:46:23 <uberushaximus>	when it gets planned
Aug 22 20:46:32 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	yeah, we will get to it.  :)
Aug 22 20:46:33 <herteljt>	I would talk to friends, put up things at the library, etc
Aug 22 20:46:43 <uberushaximus>	hopefully it won't be "Soon(tm)"
Aug 22 20:46:51 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	lol
Aug 22 20:47:09 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	* Mailing List Ideas/Management *
Aug 22 20:47:11 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	is the last item.
Aug 22 20:47:15 <herteljt>	Another idea I had for a project
Aug 22 20:47:25 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	er.  sorry herteljt, go ahead.  :)
Aug 22 20:47:35 <herteljt>	was to send letters to newspapers
Aug 22 20:47:43 <herteljt>	like letters to the editor
Aug 22 20:47:51 <uberushaximus>	well, that's possible
Aug 22 20:47:59 <herteljt>	we could draft up something together and submit it to papers
Aug 22 20:48:18 <herteljt>	it would include our group and links so that interested people can contact us
Aug 22 20:48:49 *	zombiechick thinks WiLoCo could make a boxed Ubuntu version available free through local retailers...
Aug 22 20:48:56 <uberushaximus>	that's plausible, however. it wouldn't reach a large audience
Aug 22 20:49:12 <herteljt>	I think that is a neat idea zombiechick
Aug 22 20:49:17 <uberushaximus>	and maybe localize it a bit
Aug 22 20:49:22 <Th3_D0ct0R>	yea that would be cool
Aug 22 20:49:42 <zombiechick>	maybe allow the retailer to make some profit... a handling charge...
Aug 22 20:49:54 <herteljt>	I guess I want to find other ways to contact people and let them know about linux
Aug 22 20:50:00 <uberushaximus>	we could ask canonical to fund that if it came to that
Aug 22 20:50:22 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	Myself and a few close friends at Eau Claire would help me advertise Ubuntu on the EC Campus.
Aug 22 20:50:24 <herteljt>	Whether through install fests or letters or whatever
Aug 22 20:50:32 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	I plan on doing something like that later this year.
Aug 22 20:50:36 <herteljt>	I miss EC
Aug 22 20:50:47 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	heh.
Aug 22 20:50:57 <herteljt>	could we put an "ideas board" on the forum
Aug 22 20:51:01 <MethodOne>	shre
Aug 22 20:51:03 <MethodOne>	sure*
Aug 22 20:51:10 <uberushaximus>	herteljt: make one ;)
Aug 22 20:51:14 <herteljt>	and throw out possible ideas for getting the word out?
Aug 22 20:51:17 <herteljt>	done and done
Aug 22 20:51:23 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	sounds good.
Aug 22 20:52:22 <Th3_D0ct0R>	hahaha sorry funny story here....but my windoes machine wont start :) it freezes on start up :P
Aug 22 20:52:35 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	it's a sign d0ct0R.
Aug 22 20:52:36 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	:P
Aug 22 20:52:36 <uberushaximus>	We could order large amounts of CDs to place in public libraries
Aug 22 20:52:45 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	uberu:  That would require funding.
Aug 22 20:52:55 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	I don't think Canonical will fund that until we become recognized.
Aug 22 20:53:00 <uberushaximus>	right
Aug 22 20:53:16 <uberushaximus>	throwing it out there
Aug 22 20:53:26 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	yeah I know, it's a good idea too.  :)
Aug 22 20:54:24 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	Shall we move onto the next item?
Aug 22 20:54:53 <herteljt>	yes
Aug 22 20:54:59 <herteljt>	I made a thread
Aug 22 20:56:28 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	* Mailing List/Management *
Aug 22 20:56:50 <herteljt>	Do you mean management of the list?
Aug 22 20:56:57 <herteljt>	or management of this group?
Aug 22 20:57:09 <herteljt>	both should be discussed
Aug 22 20:57:26 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	both.
Aug 22 20:57:40 <uberushaximus>	I never got the adminship for it
Aug 22 20:58:17 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	dang.
Aug 22 20:58:23 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	well, that's a problem.
Aug 22 20:58:48 <herteljt>	what does that mean?
Aug 22 20:58:56 <herteljt>	who is technically the admin?
Aug 22 20:59:03 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	well, uberu should be.
Aug 22 20:59:10 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	but apparently never got it when he created the group.
Aug 22 20:59:23 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	so, nobody can approve subscribers or send out e-mails as far as I know.
Aug 22 20:59:26 <herteljt>	who has it then?
Aug 22 20:59:37 <herteljt>	does it default to someone?
Aug 22 20:59:54 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	I think we just need to get it
Aug 22 21:00:01 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	from whoever created them for the groups.
Aug 22 21:00:14 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	I didn't know uberu didn't have acess to it.
Aug 22 21:00:16 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	*access
Aug 22 21:00:44 <herteljt>	how do we know who has it?
Aug 22 21:00:57 <herteljt>	uberushaximus: name is green when I log in
Aug 22 21:01:10 <herteljt>	I guess I thought that meant he was the admin on the forum
Aug 22 21:01:19 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	he is a moderator of the forum.
Aug 22 21:01:34 <Th3_D0ct0R>	not of the mailing list tho
Aug 22 21:01:40 <herteljt>	opps, my mistake
Aug 22 21:02:59 <uberushaximus>	This I suppose would be an opportune time to ask the loco a question
Aug 22 21:03:08 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	uberushaximus:  Have you contacted the supposed administrators of it?
Aug 22 21:03:09 <Th3_D0ct0R>	k
Aug 22 21:03:13 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-us-wi
Aug 22 21:03:24 <uberushaximus>	do you have any objections to a co-leadership by Ek0nomik?
Aug 22 21:03:33 <herteljt>	ubuntu-us-wi-owner@lists.ubuntu.com
Aug 22 21:03:36 <Th3_D0ct0R>	no
Aug 22 21:03:57 <herteljt>	it says that the list is run by
Aug 22 21:04:07 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	scott something.
Aug 22 21:04:10 <herteljt>	scott@thunderpunch.net
Aug 22 21:04:16 <uberushaximus>	I think he runs all of the reserved ones
Aug 22 21:04:26 <uberushaximus>	it defaults to him
Aug 22 21:04:34 <herteljt>	so I guess we need to contact him and ask him for access
Aug 22 21:04:34 <uberushaximus>	I could be wrong
Aug 22 21:04:43 <herteljt>	has anyone subscribed to the mailing list?
Aug 22 21:04:55 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	I did.
Aug 22 21:04:57 <uberushaximus>	I have
Aug 22 21:05:07 <herteljt>	when I click on the archives it says nothing has been posted
Aug 22 21:05:09 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	but who knows if any confirmations have been made.
Aug 22 21:05:35 <MethodOne>	i'm on the list
Aug 22 21:06:23 <herteljt>	well this is a pickle
Aug 22 21:06:39 <herteljt>	ok,
Aug 22 21:06:50 <uberushaximus>	not like anyone is mailing it
Aug 22 21:06:52 <uberushaximus>	;)
Aug 22 21:06:54 <Th3_D0ct0R>	i believe its a cucumber give it sum time and sum vinegar and then ull get a pickle
Aug 22 21:06:54 <herteljt>	I propose that one of us send an email to scott and ask for admin rights
Aug 22 21:07:14 *	Ek0nomik|Laptop agrees.
Aug 22 21:07:18 <uberushaximus>	I'll get on it, I guess
Aug 22 21:07:45 <herteljt>	sounds good to me
Aug 22 21:08:12 <herteljt>	speaking of management....
Aug 22 21:08:38 <herteljt>	I think that we should appoint some contact people
Aug 22 21:09:08 <uberushaximus>	"I'd like to request the posistion of mailing list manager for ubuntu-wi-us so that the wisconsin loco can start using it."
Aug 22 21:09:15 <uberushaximus>	sufficient?
Aug 22 21:09:34 <herteljt>	yes
Aug 22 21:09:39 <uberushaximus>	Ek0?
Aug 22 21:09:55 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	I'll volunteer.  Although i must say I would be more comfortable as a contact person after talking to some LUG's in WI.
Aug 22 21:10:03 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	uberu:  Sounds great.  :)
Aug 22 21:10:20 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	mostly incase an install fest question arrises.
Aug 22 21:10:37 <herteljt>	I nominate Ek0nomik for contact person
Aug 22 21:10:48 <uberushaximus>	herteljt: for what?
Aug 22 21:11:13 <herteljt>	wait, I might have gotten ahead of myself :o
Aug 22 21:12:08 <herteljt>	uberushaximus: I thought you were volunteering for mailing list manager
Aug 22 21:12:19 <herteljt>	was I wrong?
Aug 22 21:12:30 <uberushaximus>	nono, I just sent the request
Aug 22 21:12:47 <herteljt>	ahh, the joys of text communication :)
Aug 22 21:12:49 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	lol.
Aug 22 21:13:03 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	Alright, we need a mailing list manager and an "icon" for contact.
Aug 22 21:14:05 <herteljt>	if uberushaximus wants the job my vote is behind him
Aug 22 21:14:36 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	for both?
Aug 22 21:14:37 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	one?
Aug 22 21:14:45 <herteljt>	for mailing list manager
Aug 22 21:15:20 <herteljt>	here I'll make it an "official" nomination
Aug 22 21:15:34 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	I am fine w/ that.
Aug 22 21:15:34 <herteljt>	I hereby nominate uberushaximus for the position of mailing list manager
Aug 22 21:15:37 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	lol.
Aug 22 21:15:47 <uberushaximus>	ahah
Aug 22 21:15:50 <uberushaximus>	okay
Aug 22 21:15:51 <herteljt>	does anyone else want to chime in?
Aug 22 21:15:54 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	I think an e-mail once a week could be good.  :)
Aug 22 21:16:02 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	or every other along with the meeting.
Aug 22 21:16:13 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	I think we three may be the only survivors.  :/
Aug 22 21:16:24 <herteljt>	Th3_D0ct0R?
Aug 22 21:16:29 <uberushaximus>	Ek0nomik|Laptop: maybe with a transcript attached?
Aug 22 21:16:30 <Th3_D0ct0R>	yesuh?
Aug 22 21:16:37 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	uber:  sounds good.
Aug 22 21:16:47 <herteljt>	just checking to see if you were monitoring
Aug 22 21:16:56 <Th3_D0ct0R>	sorry the batery in my keyboard died:(
Aug 22 21:17:02 <hoosfoos>	I've been reading along too
Aug 22 21:17:14 <herteljt>	why don't you just use your sonic screwdriver :)
Aug 22 21:17:20 <uberushaximus>	well, is there any more official business that needs to be taken care of?
Aug 22 21:17:26 <Th3_D0ct0R>	oh well its in the shop being repaired
Aug 22 21:17:38 <Th3_D0ct0R>	and its great to meet a nother doctor fan :)
Aug 22 21:18:16 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	uberu:  forum co-moderation?
Aug 22 21:18:19 <herteljt>	I think we need a contact person
Aug 22 21:18:44 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	herteljt:  I agree, we won't need it until we start advertising though.
Aug 22 21:18:55 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	I will nominate myself for the time being if nobody minds.
Aug 22 21:19:10 <herteljt>	I second your nomination :)
Aug 22 21:19:19 <Th3_D0ct0R>	haha ill trhow in a third
Aug 22 21:19:20 <uberushaximus>	well the "team contact" officially is me
Aug 22 21:19:23 <uberushaximus>	but sure
Aug 22 21:19:29 <herteljt>	oppsss
Aug 22 21:19:37 <herteljt>	I don't want to step on anyone's toes
Aug 22 21:19:41 <uberushaximus>	I don't see the harm
Aug 22 21:19:52 <uberushaximus>	just change it accordingly
Aug 22 21:19:59 <uberushaximus>	in the loco list
Aug 22 21:20:43 <herteljt>	great
Aug 22 21:21:14 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	Change what?
Aug 22 21:21:28 <uberushaximus>	the team contact email
Aug 22 21:21:32 <uberushaximus>	and name
Aug 22 21:21:34 <herteljt>	with a group this small I don't think we need to worry about other positions (like a president or head hanco)
Aug 22 21:21:44 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	uberushaximus:  You will ask (is it matthew - the admin) of the ubuntu forums?
Aug 22 21:21:51 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	yeah, we are fine herteljt.
Aug 22 21:22:00 <herteljt>	but it may be something we need to consider in the future
Aug 22 21:22:11 <uberushaximus>	Ek0nomik|Laptop: in reguards to what? ... oh
Aug 22 21:22:13 <uberushaximus>	it's ryan

Aug 22 21:24:08 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	you'll send one uberu?
Aug 22 21:24:15 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	I think working with LUG's will be something.
Aug 22 21:24:17 <uberushaximus>	yeah I'll do it this time ;)
Aug 22 21:24:18 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	website may also be something.
Aug 22 21:24:22 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	and project ideas.
Aug 22 21:25:19 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	I will post the conclusions and the transcript later this evening.
Aug 22 21:25:50 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	and let me know what ubuntugeek says Uber.
Aug 22 21:26:02 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	I will create a conclusions thread as well.
Aug 22 21:26:19 <Ek0nomik|Laptop>	But, I need to run.  So, have a good evening everyone.   :)  It was good to finally discuss some ideas.
