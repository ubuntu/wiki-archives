__TOC__

Some applicatoins open in a different browser than what I set as the default browser. 

 To work around this in LXDE open default apps for lxsession.  On the row that says browser move the mouse to the right and click on the button that says more. Then click on set debian default program and enter your password to set the debian default browser by update alternatives. This should make lxterminal links and apport open in this browser you set as the debian default.
