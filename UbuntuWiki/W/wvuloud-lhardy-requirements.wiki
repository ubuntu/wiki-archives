== lHardy Requirements ==

 If we are going to make a new version of LOUD based off of Ubuntu 8.04 (Hardy Heron), there are a few things we're going to need. <<BR>>

* Repository for lHardy (at least lhardy(-test); possibly lhardy-internal(-test), although that seems more like an LCSEE concern when we start using lHardy) (minimal difficulty, would require editing lcsee-mirror) <<BR>>

* New version of loud-apt to set up the Hardy Heron and lHardy repositories, contained in above mentioned repository (just need a new version in SVN, 5.0.0 maybe?  anyways, trivial difficulty) <<BR>>

* New preseed for lHardy (trivial difficulty)
