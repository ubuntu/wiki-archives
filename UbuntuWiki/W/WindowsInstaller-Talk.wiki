=== VMPlayer + Ubuntu Virtual Appliance ===
I've been trying out VMPlayer (a virtual machine application) together with the Ubuntu appliance. This is a great combination as it effectively allows you to run Ubuntu in a sandbox in your Windows environment. You can flick between Ubuntu and Windows just as if Ubuntu is a normal Windows application, you can also run it full-screen so it runs as if Windows isn't even there.

Worth checking out. Download the VMPlayer app first, and then the Ubuntu appliance: http://www.vmware.com/appliances/
