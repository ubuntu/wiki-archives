Hi :-).

I sometimes report bugs ... and wish I had the time and skills to fix them myself and contribute code etc.

Anyway, there seem to be many excellent people doing the fixing, coding, etc. - keep up the great work :-).

I have been using GNU/Linux on and off for several years ... going back into the mid-'90s.

My current interests include <nowiki>[[http://wikieducator.org/Libre_knowledge|libre knowledge]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[http://gnu.org|free software]]</nowiki>, ICT in education, ... ''Knowledge for all, freedom to learn, towards collective wisdom''.

Aspirations: to contribute more to the commons ....

My home page is <nowiki>[[http://wikieducator.org/User:KTucker|here]]</nowiki>.
