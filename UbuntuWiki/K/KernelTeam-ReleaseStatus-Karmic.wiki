=== Release Meeting Bugs ===

All of these bugs are milestoned to ''Ubuntu karmic-updates' or are
believed fixed.

** <nowiki>[[Bug:290153]]</nowiki>: Fails to find boot device in Intel D945Gnt
*** '''Un-milestoned for karmic''': requesting testing with karmic final.
** <nowiki>[[Bug:435917]]</nowiki>: BUG: scheduling while atomic: swapper - using ppp [kernel 2.6.31-10.35-generic]
*** '''Slow Progress''': testing with latest kernel still exhibits, needs testing upstream.
** <nowiki>[[Bug:423767]]</nowiki>: please enable rt3070sta in the imx51 kernel
*** '''Slow Progress''': waiting on firmware being sorted for arm
** <nowiki>[[Bug:431963]]</nowiki>: io/fs errors when launching gdm on imx51 with sata
*** '''Slow Progress''': we now have the hardware required to test and can reproduce this issue
** <nowiki>[[Bug:450940]]</nowiki>: Regression in linux-mvl-dove 207 and later causes Y0 boards to hang seconds after booting
*** '''Fixed''': we believe that this is triggered by a bootrom/kernel interaction, bootrom needing update to boot.  May need a release note.

| <rowbgcolor="#ff9933"> <nowiki>[[https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/kernel-karmic-kms|kernel-karmic-kms]]</nowiki>
| KMS In the Ubuntu Kernel
| '''Complete''' KMS for Intel i915 enabled by default userspace drivers are KMS enabled, testing so far is good, Intel is basically complete.  KMS for ATI Radeon is partially available but not of sufficient quality in 2.6.31 to enable for release.  Nouveau did not make Karmic kernel so KMS is not an option for Nvidia at this time.  Complete.

| '''Good Progress''' Created Hardy branch in Jaunty repo, built in Hardy chroot (without makedumpfile).  Binary packages available for testing in a PPA

| Review all non-upstreamed code to see if it is worth carrying in the Ubuntu kernel tree.
| '''Complete''' a number of non-functional drivers removed, a number of drivers fixed or updated, review of the remainder underway.

| '''Complete''' see the ''Summarized new policy'' section of https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelTeam/Specs/SRUPolicyReveiw
|-
| <rowbgcolor="#999999"> <nowiki>[[https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/kernel-karmic-android|kernel-karmic-android]]</nowiki>

| '''Deferred''' awaiting resource availability
|-
| <rowbgcolor="#ff9933"> <nowiki>[[https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/kernel-karmic-ssd|kernel-karmic-ssd]]</nowiki>
| Can we detect and autotune SSDs better for Karmic?
| '''Complete''' There are two main recommendations from this work, first that we use ext4 (which is now default), and second that we align partitions on 128KB boundaries by default.  Also ATA TRIM will be beneficial, kernel work is already ongoing upstream so no action required.
|-
| <rowbgcolor="#ffff00"> <nowiki>[[https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/kernel-karmic-suspend-resume|kernel-karmic-suspend-resume]]</nowiki>
| Make suspend/resume better

|-
| <rowbgcolor="#ffff00"> <nowiki>[[https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/kernel-karmic-wifi|kernel-karmic-wifi]]</nowiki>
| Improve wifi in Karmic
| '''Started'''.  rfkill has been completely rewritten for 2.6.31, but it still has some bugs. The acpi-support package is dependent on rfkill, which does not work correctly as of 2.6.31-rc4.  Apport hooks needed for 'wifi'

|-
| <rowbgcolor="#ff9933"> <nowiki>[[https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/kernel-karmic-config-rework|kernel-karmic-config-rework]]</nowiki>
| The kernel configuration is currently entirely independent between architectures. This makes it easy to fail to carry changes say for security improvements over to all of the architectures. It would be better to have a more sophisticated mechanism for specifying the config. We should evaluate the config overrides system used in debian at least.
| '''Complete''' -- we now have a cross arch common config, plus a separate common config for all ports architectures.

|-
| <rowbgcolor="#00ff00"> KernelTeam/ReleaseStatus/AppArmor
| Apparmor for Karmic, Upstream AppArmor
| '''In Progress'''. AppArmor isn't going to make the 2.6.31 merge window. The AA team was attempting to implement some new features beyond those that existed in Jaunty which were causing some development delays.  Those new features will be delayed until we at least have feature parity with Jaunty. Apparmor is available in Karmic and barring outstanding bugs has feature parity with Jaunty.  Upstreaming is just starting aiming for the 2.6.32 window.  See KernelTeam/ReleaseStatus/AppArmor for specific item status.  All the main bugs in AppArmor are now closed off.
