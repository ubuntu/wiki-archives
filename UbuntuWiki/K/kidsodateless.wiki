=== My Ubuntu Story ===

2007: I met Edubuntu 7.10 at my college school installed on Pentium III in library way back in 2007,
our school use many variants of Ubuntu such as xubuntu on computer laboratory, Ubuntu Studio on multimedia room, Edubuntu on library for research and Ubuntu Desktop for file Server in Technical room, I had even FOSS subjects there that influenced me to be a devotee.

2008: I'm Ubuntu Live CD user since 8.04 (I don't have machine that time, so I use to borrow from my neighbor, {{https://wiki.ubuntu.com/htdocs/light/img/icon_biggrin.png}} don't laugh but until now. Currently a full time user at work {{https://wiki.ubuntu.com/htdocs/light/img/icon_wink.png}}).

=== Loco Community ===

Attended Ubuntu Philippine Team's Parties': Ubuntu karmic ,Lucid Lynx, Natty Narwhal, Oneiric Oncelot, and Precise Pangolin.

=== Advocating FOSS thru Ubuntu ===

Operating System is the foundation of application software. therefore, I believe that if everyone will use Ubuntu then they will probably use FOSS applications too.

=== Testimonials ===

Efren has been an active contributor ever since I started in the Ubuntu community. He has been part of many events globally and locally some of which he organized. He has represented well the principles of Free and Open Source Software (most particularly Ubuntu) wherever he goes and whoever he meets. His dedication to bringing the quality of software through bug triaging and ISO testing proves that he is indeed an asset and an advocate of excellence.

The Philippine Ubuntu Team needs someone like Efren. His Ubuntu membership will surely benefit not only the local community but also the global community of users, testers, developers and advocates as well. Thumbs up for kidsodateless!

''By <nowiki>[[JeanAustinR]]</nowiki>.''

He's been to many parts of the archipelago and when ever he may roam, His Ubuntu & FOSS Advocacy always shines through, he's very effective in engaging Ubuntu discussions with the younger crowd. His contribution speaks for itself, as a current Ubuntu Member myself, I do believe that his membership will be essential to the loco and to the Ubuntu Community as a whole.
