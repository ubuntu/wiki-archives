Thank you so much for your work, I'm still not ready to switch to kde4, so I'm really glad KDE3 is still supported.
I would like to bring to your attention, that the compiz support is still messy. I managed to make it work but one thing is missing, hardy used to have a package called kicker-taskbar-compiz. I would need it because when I rotate my desktop cube every window disappears from the taskbar.
