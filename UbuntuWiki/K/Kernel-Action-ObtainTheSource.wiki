=== Obtaining the source for an Ubuntu release ===

There are a number of different ways of getting the kernel sources.  The two main ways will be documented here.

If you have installed a version of Ubuntu and you want to make changes to the kernel that is installed on your system, use the '''apt-get''' method (described below) to obtain the sources.

However, if you wish to get the most up to date sources for the Ubuntu release you are running and make changes to that, use the '''git''' method (described below) to obtain the sources.
