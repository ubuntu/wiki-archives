==== What was done engineering wise? ====
We have rebased our Raring kernel to the upstream v3.8-rc6 Linux kernel and have already uploaded.  We also uploaded initial support for arm multiplatform support [1] for TI omap3/4 and Freescale imx6, alx ethernet driver support, and a security fix for CVE-2013-0231.  A security fix for CVE-2013-0216 has also been queued.

==== What's about to land that might impact the other teams and release as a whole? ====
Nothing at this time.

==== Dependencies on other teams to make deliverables, blocking items, release wide concerns? ====
Nothing at this time.
