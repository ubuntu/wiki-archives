<<BR>>

I am applying because:

** I'd like to eliminate delays in getting my work sponsored ✓
** I'd like to reduce the burden on my sponsors ✓
** I want to contribute to Ubuntu even more by helping to unblock other potential uploaders ✓☺

== Who I am ==
Hello! My name's Chloé/Chlo/kajiya/Smithy (I really don't mind) and I currently work in the cloud images team, specifically in the GCP (Google Compute Platform) squad. Big shout out to CPC! My job has a healthy mix of BASH, Python, Go and general Ubuntu hackery and development. I'm not just saying this - I love this job and it's easily the best one I've ever had ☺ My previous background was mostly in secure-coding and C/C++ development (with a sprinkle of cloud to boot).  

== My Ubuntu story ==
I actually discovered Linux by accident - my high school wasn't huge on IT so it completely passed me by until I got to University. I'd heard of Ubuntu, Debian, etc. from my gaming adventures but never actually used any of them. I was studying Physics, and all the lab computers were running Ubuntu (I want to say it was Precise Pangolin?) Anyways, from then on I was always curious, and I eventually started using Ubuntu as my daily driver. It's been my daily driver for about 10 years now and it's never let me down ☺

==== Reviews for others ====

   <nowiki>[[https://code.launchpad.net/~mirespace/ubuntu/+source/walinuxagent/+git/walinuxagent/+merge/468336|MRE commit reviewed]]</nowiki>

=== Areas of work ===
Being a part of CPC gives me a lot of exposure to other great teams in Ubuntu; namely Server, Kernel and Foundations. I feel like I (and the whole of CPC of course) have a very good working relationship with these teams. We try to be mindful all the while of the sheer amount of work everybody typically has, and therefore only bother them when we really need help.

With the four guest agents we package for Google, we now have a set schedule where Google will release an upstream code cut to us every ~3 months. As (currently) the sole developer who packages these and shepherds through to SRU, there's rarely a time nowadays where I'm not working on ''something'' packaging related. Whether that be testing from -proposed, wrestling with golang vendoring or asking nicely in IRC for sponsorship ☺

=== Things I could do better ===
There's probably ''a tonne'' of things I could do better - but these come to mind straight away:

* Spending more time on the backlog of bugs we have in cloud-images
* I also want to review more code - I feel that that is a particular skill of mine I could offer more widely

== Plans for the future ==
=== General ===
There are lots of things I'd like to happen (or at the very least keep working towards), but here's a few:

* Unblock Ubuntu contributors by:
*** Sponsoring their uploads (assuming I get the rights)
*** Reviewing their code where necessary
*** Being present in IRC to help people quickly with any questions
    
I do have a (somewhat pipe) dream to eventually become a core-dev one day, and if that happens I'd definitely be up for joining the SRU team (to help take some of the load off!)

=== What I like least in Ubuntu ===
It's actually not Ubuntu's fault at all, but there's only one thing and one thing alone I dislike about Ubuntu (and Linux in general):

* Drivers.

Let's just say I'm happy I'm more of a console gamer.
