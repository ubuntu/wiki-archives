'''This page describes what in Kubuntu Gutsy 7.10 still needs console or a manual editing of a file to make it works.'''

== Previous editions ==

== Mission ==
'''The primary mission for a desktop OS is to be user-friendly and for newbie users console is NOT user-friendly, also for write very simple commands or editing configuration files. Past editions were criticized because sometimes there is a method to not use the console, but of course it was a way to not understand the REAL goal that is: NO console and NO extra configuration via config files, only and only UI for everythings. So I changed the title to make more clear!'''

'''It will be fantastic to see a distribution one day that will can do all these stuff via GUI and without configuring manually a file. Well I have to say that a LOT was done in Feisty and Gutsy to remove manual configurations, but still something is here, and something new I discovered, yes regressions!'''

== Adept ==
* to add a proxy you need a '' '''Alt+F2 -> kdesudo kate /etc/apt/apt.conf''' ''
* to delete all .deb files downloaded you need a '' '''sudo apt-get clean''' ''

== KDE Guidance ==

==== System Services ====
* to add a script taken from the filesystem in the list you need a '' '''sudo update-rc.d <script> defaults''' '' <nowiki>[[http://launchpad.net/bugs/48417|#48417]]</nowiki> -> rejected
* to delete a script in the list you need a '' '''sudo update-rc.d <script> remove''' '' <nowiki>[[http://launchpad.net/bugs/48417|#48417]]</nowiki> -> rejected

== Packages ==

==== alien (and KDE integration) ====
* to convert a rpm you need a '' '''sudo alien <file>''' '' <nowiki>[[http://launchpad.net/bugs/48597|#48597]]</nowiki> -> Unbelievable rejected!

==== grub ====
* to install it in another hard disk you need a '' '''sudo grub-install etc.''' ''
* to modify the menu you need a '' '''Alt+F2 -> kdesudo kate /boot/grub/menu.lst''' ''

==== samba ====
* to add a user you need a '' '''sudo smbpasswd -a <user>''' '' <nowiki>[[http://launchpad.net/bugs/16575|#16575]]</nowiki>
*** KMenu->System Settings->Sharing - Select shared folder->Change... - More Samba Options - Users Tab - Add User '''--> doesn't work!'''

== Konqueror services menu ==

==== Install two or more debian packages with dependencies (like Google Earth that has a data package and another that depends on data one) ====

this is one of the worst: it worked in Edgy, they broke in Feisty (fixed but the fix was only present in some alpha version of 7.10) <nowiki>[[http://launchpad.net/bugs/108870|#108870]]</nowiki> and they broke AGAIN in Gutsy with GDebi <nowiki>[[http://launchpad.net/bugs/134331|#134331]]</nowiki>

* to install for example two or more files with dependencies you need a '' '''sudo dpkg -i <filenames>''' ''
* to install a lot of files and don't want to open one window per file you need a '' '''sudo dpkg -i <filenames>''' ''

== Network Connections ==

==== KNetworkManager ====

* if you put some manual values then knetworkmanager for example stop to automatically search for wireless networks; to make it back to automatic networks discovery you need a '' '''Alt+F2 -> kdesudo kate /etc/network/interfaces''' '' and delete all iface lines related to the desired interfaces <nowiki>[[http://launchpad.net/bugs/125767|#125767]]</nowiki>

==== ADSL ====

* to make DSL connections, one must type '' '''sudo pppoeconf''' ''
* to make PPTP connections you must edit /etc/ppp/chap-secrets and run pptp <modem> user <user> usepeerdns defaultroute.
* you must configure all your routes by hand in /etc/network/interfaces (except default gateway)
