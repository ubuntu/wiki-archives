__TOC__

Mark Jose, living in Cornwall, UK. Mainly using Ubuntu since the KDE4 change to Kubuntu, I also run an Ubuntu server and have Xubuntu on a laptop.

I was fortunate enough to get hold of one of the very earliest EeePCs in the UK and that runs Ubuntu 10.04, with quite a few of the default packages removed to reduce size. I found the Netbook Remix too sluggish on my EeePC 7.04 so prefer to run the standard Ubuntu but with the pruning as above (oh, and of course the max/min/close buttons on the RIGHT side ;) )

Of course, I have a fair number of other machines - all of which run Ubuntu of some sort.
