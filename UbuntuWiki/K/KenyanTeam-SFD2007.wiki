This is the first Software Freedom Day event that was held in the country lasting two days running from 14th September and the climax being on the 15th September. It was officially opened by the permanent secretary to Ministry of Information and Communications besides being attended by Universities, private companies and other Linux groups in the country.

There was exhibitions and the symposium was held at the conference room where we were represented by Ken Kasina who gave a presentation on the team. Although the number of exhibitors were only four (including us), we were center of attention because of the display and the Ubuntu CDs that we gave away besides on the spot burning of many more CDS for those who requested. We were also handy when it came to answering questions regarding to Linux troubleshooting and advice. Although the traffic of requests overwhelmed us and for that matter we could not complete all of them during the event, we were able to gain the trusts of the attendees by asking them to leave us with their CDs and contact them later when they were ready.

To all of those who were helpful in anyway, from setting up the booth, contributing CDs, printing T-shirts, donating laptops and the PC, and to those who took their time to attend and in particular visit our booth, we say... THANKS!!
