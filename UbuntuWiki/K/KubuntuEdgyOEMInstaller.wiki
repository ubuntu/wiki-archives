=== Kubuntu OEM Installer ===
Kubuntu OEM Installer is a Qt/KDE frontend for oem-config. This is a tool which is meant to ease re-distribution of Kubuntu by an OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer), or a Vendor who includes Kubuntu with computers that they sell.<<BR>>
It is available in the '''''main''''' component of Kubuntu 6.10 (Edgy Eft) as '''oem-config''' and '''oem-config-kde'''. The latest code can be branched from http://people.ubuntu.com/~cjwatson/bzr/oem-config/mainline/ using Bazaar VCS.

==== Use Case ====
X Inc. is a computer manufacturer who has decided to launch a new series of PCs and has chosen Kubuntu as the Operating System. X can install Kubuntu in OEM mode on a test PC, install the drivers for that particular model, include their own branding(such as wallpapers, splash screens etc.), and prepare the system to be shipped to the end-user. They can then replicate the hard disk image onto hard disks on computers which they would ship. When their customer(end-user) switches on the computer for the first time, the user would be prompted for their location/locale, keyboard layout, timezone and then would be asked to create a user account.

==== Usage ====
# We first Install Kubuntu in OEM mode, this option is found in the alternate/text install cd. <<BR>> <nowiki>[[File:1.png]]</nowiki> <<BR>> <<BR>>
# The rest of the Installation is similar to the normal text installation, except that, a password is asked for the user '''oem''', which is the default user (with administrative privileges using 'sudo').
# At the End of the Installation, a message is displayed, which details, what we should do next. <nowiki>[[File:2.png]]</nowiki> <<BR>> <<BR>>
# After a restart, KDM, is loaded and we login as "oem". After doing the necessary changes(install drivers, add packages etc.), we run{{{
sudo oem-config-prepare}}} This removes the "oem" user, and on next boot launches the OEM Configuration Wizard. attachment:3.png <nowiki>[[BR]]</nowiki> <nowiki>[[BR]]</nowiki>
 0. On the next boot(which would be the 'First Boot' for the user), The OEM Configuration Wizard is lauched, which generally has four steps.
