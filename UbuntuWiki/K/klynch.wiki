=== About Me ===
Community,

I am Keenan. I live in the great, although often cold, state of Minnesota. I have been using linux for the last two years and can gladly say that "there is no going back for me!" I believe ubuntu to be an important project in the software world, and fully support the growth of an open-source community.

Prior to using linux I could be observed fighting with a popular proprietary operating system. Although I became quite versed in the inner-workings-so-to-say of that OS, I was unaware of the joy of open-source software and CLI until I starting using linux. I am able to get things done much quicker, and if not quicker then with a greater efficiency and usage of my systems' hardware.

I look forward to participating in the ubuntu community and hope to contribute in someway to this open-source movement. 

=== My Involvement in the ubuntu community ===

I have only recently joined the ubuntu community and will thus update this soon.

==== Launchpad ====

Launchpad looks very interesting and I am actively exploring the interface while trying to learn as much as I can about it.

==== LoCo ====

I can often be found on Minnesota LoCo channel. irc.freenode.net #ubuntu-us-mn

=== Current Projects and goals ===

I am currently learning Python along with more general linux usage. 

I am interested in programming and the general hacker culture as a whole. If the reader believes me to be referring to what the media considers a hacker, I would have you read a note from ESR on <nowiki>[[http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html|hackerdom]]</nowiki>. Don't know who ESR is? You have more reading to do: <nowiki>[[http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/|The Cathedral and the Bazaar]]</nowiki>. 

=== Future Plans and Projects ===

After finishing Python, I would like to move onto C and then maybe, if I ever obtain the requisite knowledge, the holy grail of programming LISP. I also want to contribute with helping people new to linux and software in general. I seem to have a knack with explaining the sometimes un-explainable.
