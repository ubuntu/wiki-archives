__TOC__

This page is a list of things for Kubuntu Developers to do:

Package updates:
** Kid3
** Klogic

Other Stuff
	gamin rebuilds.
	get involved in MOTU school, and mentoring, maybe.
	Get people to help Lure with the keyboard shortcuts stuff, by listing their keyboard shortcuts.

* Work on unmet dependancies.
    Use apt-cache unmet packagename to see the unmet dependancies.  (warning, there are a lot)

TO DO LATER IN EDGY DEVELOPMENT
	Check that people can upgrade without kubuntu-desktop being removed.
	
	Check that localisations for all apps are installed - are there metapacks for these languages, which install all localisations for that language?  Could be messy, with gnome/kde.
