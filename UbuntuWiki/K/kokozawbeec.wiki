=== About Zaw Lay ===

Hello everybody, my nick name is zawlay. I'm Buddhist. I'm from Bago, Burma(Myanmar). I love linux OS, I love Ubuntu OS.

Previous time, I touched Ubuntu about 2008 but usage time is not longer. Because I have no owned computer. In 2013, I was using to Ubuntu 12 LTS and got hard things. Now, I'm using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Windows 7. Ubuntu OS is nice for me and using Python Programming Lessons, Web Developement Lessons (Html, Css, Java Script). Default Text editor gedit is the best. I love Websites and also love programming. But, I'm newbie.

And, I knew Ubuntu Myanmar LoCo Team with Ubuntu 13 OS Guide Line Book. So, I interested to Ubuntu Myanmar LoCo Team and joined facebook group. Ubuntu Myanmar LoCo Team Group is powerful for me and I'll be known Ubuntu knowledge. Thank for very much! Now, I'm trying to as a member of Ubuntu Myanmar LoCo Team.
