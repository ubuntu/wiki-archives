__TOC__

I guess this is where I describe myself.

I am a self-taught computer enthusiast. I started working with computers at the age of twelve, and picked up a strong interest in Linux during high school, at approximately the age of sixteen.

Currently, my knowledge of Linux is medium-advanced. My aims are to learn about Linux through the community and to be able to contribute some creativity of my own along with helping those who are hopelessly lost ;) 

I am not online on IRC often.. but when I am it is under the name 'decaelo'. If you have any questions or need help with anything, don't hesitate to ask. You can even e-mail me; 'kev.cain@gmail.com' is my email address.

Currently running Ubuntu 6.06 LTS on a Toshiba Satellite M70-SR3.
