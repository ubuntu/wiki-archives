== Introduction ==
Karmic Koala will in time become Kubuntu 9.10.

The focus for 9.10 for the Kubuntu community will be refining the KDE desktop experience while at the same time reaching out to new, exciting features. The plan is to continue maintaining our excellent KDE packages while developing tools to make managing your desktop and communicating with your friends easier. Karmic is the first station on the way to a more sociable and powerful desktop seen nowhere else.

Alpha 4, the fourth in a series of testing CD images that will be released throughout this cycle, represents the very latest snapshot of Karmic Koala. The pre-release images are known to be reasonably free of major undocumented CD-build or installer bugs, however they are not recommended for use in stable environments. These releases will be for those who are developing, documenting, and testing. Alpha releases can be downloaded from the following URL:
* http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/releases/karmic/alpha-4/

== Checking iso ==
Its always best to check cd image before install!
Check the md5 with comand md5sum /path/iso or for cd md5sum /dev/sr0
'''NOTE:''' ''This is an alpha (pre-) release. Pre-release versions of Karmic are '''__NOT__''' encouraged for anyone needing a stable system or for anyone who is not comfortable running into occasional, even frequent, breakage. Pre-release versions of Karmic '''__ARE__''' recommended for Kubuntu developers and those who want to help in testing, reporting, and fixing bugs.' Please do not use this in a production environment with data  or workflows that you cannot do without''

== New or Improved In Alpha 4 ==

Pretty much everything!!

The Karmic Koala Alpha 4 CD release brings with it a brand new desktop as well as many new fixes and applications. For this latest release of Kubuntu 9.10, we are adding several interesting features to the desktop experience, building on the latest KDE. Besides these changes, there have been updates to many common applications as well as bug fixes to some of those annoyances you may or may not have run into. With every new pre-release, updates will be documented allowing you to thoroughly test your new Kubuntu test installation. Remember that all of these features are part of a pre-release version of Kubuntu, and may still have issues. We ask that any problems you come across that you file a bug, if one has yet to be filed for your problem.<<BR>>

=== Netbook ===
<nowiki>[[File:newspaper-300x225.jpg]]</nowiki>

Our netbook edition is taking shape with the addition of the Plasma Netbook shell.  usb-creator is currently undergoing changes so you need to use the version from jaunty or install by burning a DVD.  More details on Plasma Netbook <nowiki>[[Kubuntu-NetbookPlasma|here]]</nowiki>.

=== Message Indicator ===
<nowiki>[[File:message-indicator-message.png]]</nowiki>

A new message indicator has been added which currently has a plugin for Konversation.  No need to be distracted by IRC pings when you don't want to be, but easy to find out who has been leaving messages for you when you want to.  Expect more applications to be added soon.

=== Installer Bling ===
<nowiki>[[File:ubiquity-wee.png]]</nowiki>

<nowiki>[[File:screen2-wee.png]]</nowiki>

Amarok 2.1.1 is a robust update that includes many bug fixes, new features, and refinements of old features.

=== KPackageKit 0.4.1.1 ===
<nowiki>[[File:kpackagekit2.png]]</nowiki>

Kubuntu 9.10 will include the latest release of KPackageKit. New in 0.4.1.1 are new notifications, sweet animations, a history feature, usability fixes and a more robust overall experience with fewer bugs.

<nowiki>[[File:screen4-wee.png]]</nowiki>

One of the last KDE3 mainstays of previous releases, K3b has now been ported to KDE4. Kubuntu 9.10 will be shipping the KDE4 version of K3b.

=== Social from the Start ===
KDE 4.3 brings with it several new social desktop features spread across the entire desktop. In a world of Microblogging and Facebook, it makes sense for the desktop to integrate with these features from the get-go.

New social features include:
** The KDE microblogging Plasma widget as part of the default desktop experience for all of your identi.ca and Twitter needs
** The <nowiki>[[http://www.opendesktop.org/|openDesktop]]</nowiki> Plasma widget as part of the default desktop experience
** The Facebook Kopete plugin so that you can chat with your Facebook contacts from the comfort of the default chat client

Also to be included on the DVD is choqoK, for a more in-depth microblogging experience.

=== GTK+ Integration ===
==== QtCurve 0.65.2 ====
<nowiki>[[File:screen5-wee.png]]</nowiki>

QtCurve 0.65.2 brings a refinement of the Oxygen-like widget style so that your GNOME apps will look more at home in KDE.

==== kcm-gtk 0.5.2 ====
<nowiki>[[File:kcm-gtk2.png]]</nowiki>

Kubuntu 9.10 offers further control over the look of your GNOME apps in KDE. The GTK+ Appearance System Settings module from previous releases makes a comeback, as it had been removed from distribution because it was tied to the obsolete gtk-qt-engine. We have made it standalone software so that you can configure the GTK+ widget style and fonts for your favorite GNOME apps in KDE.

=== Known Issues ===

* The Kubuntu Netbook Edition is missing the "install" icon on the desktop. You can start the installation from the menu. (Bug:402878)

* The Kubuntu Netbook Edition image does not install under Windows (with wubi). (Bug:402850)
