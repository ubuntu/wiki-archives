__TOC__

This is the Kubuntu Product Backlog. A product backlog lists the items that "add value" i.e. need to be done. The backlog persists across releases. Items are added when decided they are of importance and are scratched out when done. After the release, the backlog is purged of ''finished'' items. Do not add something here before discussing it with the product owner (Riddell).

The task should be as clear as possible. If the task cannot be described briefly, consider making a wishlish bug in launchpad and linking to it from this page.

== Desktop ==
* investiage setting grab server to through in kdmrc
* see if kde-config-synaptics can replace kde-config-touchpad (which is abandoned upstream)
* kwallet single sign-on (https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=92845)
* improve kde startup speed
*** Load KDED Services later on after plasma-desktop/netbook 
* update printer tools

*** Make it work
*** add to kde feature plan
*** get into KDE SC 4.6 (MUST HAVE)
*** get dfaure to review
* installer
*** ensure wifi setup can be done from installer (non live session)
*** ensure jockey -a gets run for the live sessions from ubiquity as well as target install
* evaluate muon (needs clarification)
* kpackage kit improvements (needs clarification)
* language
** set $LANG in ~/.kde/env/ script based on KDE language
** merge language selector features in KCM
* gstreamer phonon
*** test and consider if we should use gstreamer phonon backend (consult sandsmark and markey).
*** make sure gstreamer doesn't bring in lots of random gnome libraries
* make a kde games menu with a link to install games
* split up kdegames-card-data (get upstream to move bad ones to kdeartwork)

* make sure libreoffice rawbuild has kde4 support and up to date patches [shtylman]

=== Ubuntu One ===
* update to new auth mechanism

* evaluage mobile kwin if available
* package mobile pim (separate from normal KDE-PIM)
* make sure arm configurations match the targets
* consider NODM as KDM replacement
* on screen keyboard (we need one)
* ksmserver
** splitting out into separate package
** kdebase-workspace-bin has lots of bits in it; split out those needed by mobile

* image size
** work out what can be moved from kubuntu-common to desktop to get it out of mobile
** work out what can be ignored from desktop-common (i.e. depend on standard and bring in only those bits necesssary from desktop-common)
* udev rules, add for N900 to kubuntu-mobile-default-settings

* wiki docs on how to get kubuntu mobile installed onto N900, using meego kernel, flashing etc

* graphics
*** needs OpenGL-ES drivers from vendor.  licence problems (work with vendors)

== Packaging ==

* integrate automatic building with KDE dashboard
* make sure PPA packaging is based on current release as much as possible
*** (re-)propose to tech board to include updates in -updates, QA'd in PPA first
* inform debian of delta in packaging
* patch review (see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UDSProceedings/N/ApplicationDevelopers#Qt Patch Review)
* ensure latest koffice
* ensure latest kdevelop
* ensure latest amarok
* package kde 4.6 for natty (4.6 will be default)
* package owncloud
*** discuss with kali and other upstream if it should be in release or PPA, depends on maturity
* check if plasma-media-centre is mature enough to package
*** investigate if suitable for use within mythbuntu, or if mythtv should be integrated with plasma-media-centre
* package kde-config-synaptics
* put muon on the dvd
* package lionmail
* get latest plasma mobile packaged
* make CD only english and update the languagepacks (to save space)
* make a kubuntu-desktop-all metapackage

* *buntu logos across loco.ubuntu.com footer
* correct derivatives page to "flavours" (or a less derogitory word than derivatives)
* follow ubuntu features and collaborate with kde upstream to get it shipped in kubuntu (needs clarification)
* recruit more kubuntu developers from the kubuntu support channel
* replace old logo uses with new logo uses
*** kubuntu_news on twitter
*** wiki.kubuntu.com logo
* state of accessability apps in Kubuntu
** cellwriter https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=234926
