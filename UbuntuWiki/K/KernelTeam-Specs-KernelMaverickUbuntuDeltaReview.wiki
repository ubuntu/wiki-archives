=== Summary ===

Review of the current Ubuntu Kernel patch delta from upstream. This session will look at the current delta comprised of both patches to the core and the ubuntu specific drivers. The aim is to record what we are carrying, review the reasons for that component(s) to be carried, and recommend replacements, updates, cleanups, upstreaming etc of those components.

=== Release Note ===

TBD

=== Rationale ===

All patches and drivers carried in the Ubuntu delta are not automatically sync'd with the upstream kernel for various reasons.  This places a maintenance burden on the Ubuntu kernel team. These patches and drivers must be regularly reviewed to determine if they are still needed, if they need updating to a later version, or if they are now ready for upstream acceptance. The purpose of this blueprint is to facilitate and record this review for the Maverick cycle.

It's interesting to note that when we first started generating the Maverick kernel, Lucid was between 2.6.32-16.25 and 2.6.32-17.26 and was carrying approximately 1422 patches on top of the vanilla v2.6.32 kernel.  With this as the starting point for Maverick, we've broken down our review as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| # patches

|-
| 1422
| patches on top of the v2.6.32 kernel

=== Ubuntu Delta ===
The Ubuntu delta is split into two distinct sections, the core patches and the Ubuntu drivers (those in the ubuntu/ directory).

==== Ubuntu Patches ====
Below is our review of the patches we are carrying in Maverick as of 2.6.31-1.3.  They are split into 3 sections:

# Patches needing further study
# Patches to keep
# Patches dropped

===== Patches needing further study =====
I've grouped these by patch owner.

** Original author Arjan van de Ven <arjan@linux.intel.com>
** The commit notes this would potentially hit the 2.6.33 kernel which it appears it hasn't.  Do you know the current status for this getting merged upstream?

====== Andy Whitcroft <apw@canonical.com> ======
1. ecfcdf2 UBUNTU: staging/go7007 -- disable
** ogasawara: Can I re-enable this (ie drop this patch) assuming it doesn't give me build failures
** apw: DROP (complete)
1. 04c9539 UBUNTU: [Config] staging/winbond -- disable

1. cdfa310 x86, mce: Xeon75xx specific interface to get corrected memory error information
** ogasawara: Seems this should be hitting upstream, will carry until we drop in favor of the upstream patch
** commit c773f70fd6b53ee646727f871833e53649907264 upstream (linux-2.6-tip)
1. e3952ff x86, mce: Rename cpu_specific_poll to mce_cpu_specific_poll

1. 89d6837 x86, mce: Make xeon75xx memory driver dependent on PCI
** ogasawara: Seems this should be hitting upstream, will carry until we drop in favor of the upstream patch
1. a8f36ed UBUNTU: SAUCE: i915 -- disable powersave by default
** ogasawara: Is this still necessary or should we try dropping it and see what happens?
** commit 757fd770c649b0dfa6eeefc2d5e2ea3119b6be9c upstream (linux-2.6-tip)
1. 09de1e9 UBUNTU: SAUCE: cdrom -- default to not locking the tray when in use
** ogasawara: Should this go upstream?
** apw: this is very much a local distro choice and we expect to carry this as a SAUCE patch
1. ff0f7be UBUNTU: SAUCE: KMS: cache the EDID information of the LVDS
** Original author Arjan van de Ven <arjan@linux.intel.com>
** ogasawara: Did this go upstream?
** apw: this does not yet appear to have made upstream
1. 6d86964 [Upstream] docbook: need xmldoclinks for all doc types
** ogasawara: Does this need re-sent upstream?
** apw: pushed upstream
1. a7c8e26 UBUNTU: SAUCE: khubd -- switch USB product/manufacturer/serial handling to RCU

** apw: pushed upstream
1. 9ea6b03 UBUNTU: Fix webcam having USB ID 0ac8:303b
** Original author Jani Monoses <jani@ubuntu.com>
** ogasawara: Should this go upstream or should we try dropping this?
** apw: this patch is effectivly mooted by the configuration option CONFIG_USB_GSPCA_ZC3XX which we have =m and therefore this patch can be dropped
1. dcfd09d UBUNTU: SAUCE: toshiba_acpi -- pull in current -dev version of driver
** ogasawara: Do we still want/need to carry this -dev version?
** apw: the remaining patch seems to include only the older /proc interfaces which I believe was only used by HAL which is gone.  I suggest we drop this and see what happens.
1. 3fc2956 UBUNTU: [Upstream] add local prefix to oss local change_bits
** ogasawara: Does this need re-sent upstream?
** apw: no longer relevant and can be dropped, likely could be upstreamed
1. ec69ab6 UBUNTU: SAUCE: hotkey quirks for various Zeptro Znote and Fujitsu Amilo laptops
** ogasawara: Should this go upstream?
** apw: this should be moved to a userspace quirk and closed
1. 0f31cdb UBUNTU: SAUCE: isapnp_init: make isa PNP scans occur async
** ogasawara: Should this go upstream?
** apw: push upstream
1. fef7ae8 UBUNTU: SAUCE: async_populate_rootfs: move rootfs init earlier

** apw: push upstream

====== Brad Figg <brad.figg@canonical.com> ======
1. 39bbc2c UBUNTU: SAUCE: Increase the default prealloc buffer for HDA audio devices (non-modem)
** Has this gone upstream?
** This patch has not yet made it upstream, bjf is inquiring why.

====== Chase Douglas <chase.douglas@canonical.com> ======
1. 7e432ba UBUNTU: SAUCE: drm/i915: don't change DRM configuration when releasing load detect pipe
** Seems this will hit upstream eventually, possibly in a different form.
1. a3ce60d UBUNTU: SAUCE: Don't register vga16fb framebuffer if other framebuffers are present
** From the commit message: "In M, we will transition to efifb and drop vga16fb, so this is a one time hack."
** I assume it's ok to drop in M then.
1. 63da13e UBUNTU: SAUCE: Disable function tracing after hitting __schedule_bug
** Didn't you propose upstream patches to enable/disable levels of tracing?
1. a62659f PCI quirks: disable msi on AMD rs4xx internal gfx bridges
** This should eventually hit upstream, will carry until we drop in favor of the upstream patch.
1. 1f760ff sched: update load count only once per cpu in 10 tick update window
** I assume this will eventually get dropped in favor of whatever form of the patch lands upstream.

====== Colin Ian King <colin.king@canonical.com> ======

====== Manoj Iyer <manoj.iyer@canonical.com> ======
1. 796df74 UBUNTU: SAUCE: Added quirk to recognize GE0301 3G modem as an interface.
** Seems this should be submitted upstream
1. 6336ace drm/radeon/bo: add some fallback placements for VRAM only objects.
** cherry picked from commit 924788672f9c802a4c8e6bc8d88fbc2c9b2e3089 drm-2.6
** I assume this will eventually hit upstream, will carry until we drop in favor of the upstream patch.

====== Stefan Bader <stefan.bader@canonical.com> ======
1. f3dc297 UBUNTU: SAUCE: Restore VT fonts on switch
** smb, do we still need this as indicated from last cycle's comments?
<pre>
Again this is very old, do we still have issues here? I suspect
with KMS in the mix it is no longer required.
StefanBader: Originally from Matthew Garret, so we might ask him. But I actually think I saw code in the vga console driver that saves and restores fonts, so I guess we should drop it and see what happens.
ColinWatson: this is very likely still in use, please can we keep it.
</pre>
1. b69c3ff (pre-stable) Staging: rt2870: Add USB ID for Buffalo Airstation WLI-UC-GN
** Should eventually get upstream, will carry until we drop in favor of the upstream patch.

====== Surbhi Palande <surbhi.palande@canonical.com> ======
1. 4e1162f UBUNTU: SAUCE: HID: add support for Ortek WKB-2000
** commit cd9ec30da58bcd8ab154eba9eb54d16c67e7ef3b upsteam (linux-next)
** Hopefully should land upstream soon, will carry until we drop in favor of the upstream patch
1. cca014d UBUNTU: SAUCE: sync before umount to reduce time taken by ext4 umount
** Sound like this was a temporary fix until a proper fix lands upstream.

====== Tim Gardner <tim.gardner@canonical.com> ======
1. 876df3b UBUNTU: SAUCE: ata: blacklist FUJITSU MHW2160BH PL
** Author: Chuck Short <zulcss@ubuntu.com>, Signed-off-by: Tim Gardner <tim.gardner@canonical.com>
** Looks like this should go upstream. (sent May 4,2010 to linux-ide@vger.kernel.org and jgarzik@pobox.com)
** Dropping from Maverick - https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/kernel-team/2010-May/010432.html
1. 9e5f474 UBUNTU: SAUCE: Catch nonsense keycodes and silently ignore
** Can we indeed drop this?  Last cycle's comments as follows:
<pre>
Looks like this one can be dropped. emulate_raw() now catches key codes of 0 and drops them.
</pre>
** Drop this patch. The default case catches 0 (nonsense) scan codes:

                        code = x86_keycodes[keycode]; if (!code) return -1;
1. 0a64e18 UBUNTU: SAUCE: Guest OS does not recognize a lun with non zero target id on Vmware ESX Server
** Can we drop this?  Last cycle's comments as follows:
<pre>
This I think is only required with very old vmware? Is it still required?
</pre>
1. 0990173 UBUNTU: SAUCE: Enable an e1000e Intel Corporation 82567 Gigabit controller
** Can we drop this?  Last cycle's comments as follows:
<pre>
Can be dropped according to john.ronciak@intel.com
</pre>
** Hmm, dropping this might cause a regression. This ID is not upstream, and I'm certain it existed at one time in someone's hardware. On the other hand we could drop it and see who hollers.
1. f7cf59e UBUNTU: Sony laptop: Some Sony Vaia laptops do not enable wwan power by default.
** Should this go upstream?
** Sent upstream May 4,2010 to platform-driver-x86@vger.kernel.org malattia@linux.it
1. 0ec500e UBUNTU: SAUCE: Add MODULE_ALIAS for Dell WMI module
** Last cycle's comments as follows.  Can I drop this yet?
<pre>
This is waiting for a more correct upstream fix. Has that appeared?
</pre>
** Isn't this handled by udev once the wmi engine cranks up?
1. c4f1d8a UBUNTU: SAUCE: ipw2200: Enable LED by default
** Should this go upstream?  Or are we just carrying it to quiet the screams from some users (ie can I drop it.  Can't they use the led=1 module option? or can we throw it module-init-tools?).
** It could definitely go in module-init-tools.
1. 7da19fb UBUNTU: SAUCE: Created MODULE_EXPORT/MODULE_IMPORT macros
** I couldn't find any users of these macros in the Maverick kernel, do we still want to carry this?  If so, should this go upstream?
** We side stepped the issue by building in the dependent service, e.g., libphy. We can drop this patch AFAIC.
1. 1980cfa UBUNTU: SAUCE: Fix MODULE_IMPORT/MODULE_EXPORT
** I couldn't find any users of these macros in the Maverick kernel, do we still want to carry this?  If so, should this go upstream?
** See previous comment.
1. fc79b24 UBUNTU: [Upstream] b43: Declare all possible firmware files.
** What's the current upstream status for this?
** This patch can be dropped. The negotiated upstream patch contained a sufficient representative sampling of firmware files.
1. 1f7a7f9 UBUNTU: [Upstream] netfilter: xt_recent: Add an entry reaper
** This should land in either 2.6.34 or 2.6.35 according to the commit, will carry until we drop in favor of the upstream patch
** I think this one is queued in net-next. Will check for sure.
====== Canonical Kernel Team ======
1. e7a2b3c UBUNTU: SAUCE: input/mouse/alps: Do not call psmouse_reset() for alps
** Anyone have hardware to test and confirm this would still cause lockups on resume?
** From last cycle's comments, I'm inclined to drop it as well.  thoughts?
<pre>
This one stops us reseting alps mice on resume. Again pretty
anchient, I would like to drop it to see if things break these
days.
</pre>
1. fa85688 UBUNTU: SAUCE: r8169: disable TSO by default for RTL8111/8168B chipsets.
** Original author is Phillip Lougher <phillip@ubuntu.com>.  I'm inclined to drop this and see what happens based on last cycle's comments:
<pre>
This claims to be a temporary work around for a problem, added
in Jun 2007. Is it still needed?
</pre>
1. 5a78bd7 UBUNTU: SAUCE: hostap: send events on data interface as well as master interface
** Original author is Matthew Garrett <mjg59@srcf.ucam.org>.  Last cycle's comments as follows:
<pre>
This duplicates packates on both sides of the hostap interface.
Seem incomplete following driver changes, and I think it was to
work round broken userspace. Is this still needed?
</pre>
<pre>
Taken from #ubuntu-kernel on freenode on Thurs Jun 10, 2010
[12:25:23] <ogasawara> mjg59: hi, we've been carrying an Ubuntu kernel SAUCE patch that was originally authored by yourself years ago.  I wanted to get your feedback on it and am curious if you prefer I use your redhat.com email address or a different one?
[12:25:38] <mjg59> ogasawara: Which one is it?
[12:26:23] <ogasawara> mjg59: the patch is "UBUNTU: SAUCE: hostap: send events on data interface as well as master interface" from back in 2007
[12:26:58] <mjg59> ogasawara: That was because network manager was only listening for association events on the data interface, and hsotap was only sending them on the master interface
[12:27:14] <mjg59> ogasawara: I have no idea whether that's still an issue
[12:27:25] <ogasawara> mjg59: I'm inclined to drop it and see who screams
[12:28:17] <mjg59> ogasawara: Yeah, I'd go for it
[12:28:25] <ogasawara> mjg59: perfect, thanks
</pre>
1. 8e77956 UBUNTU: SAUCE: drivers: Remove some duplicate device entries in various modules
** Original author Ben Collins <ben.collins@canonical.com>
** Ben noted in the commit that he sent this upstream but it looks like it never got merged.

=== BoF agenda and discussion ===
<pre>
Ubuntu Delta Review
===================  ==

These two are only here because they did not build early in the Lucid cycle, and can be dropped.

  ecfcdf2 UBUNTU: staging/go7007 -- disable
  04c9539 UBUNTU: [Config] staging/winbond -- disable

This is mooted by the new grub2 boot work:
  a3ce60d UBUNTU: SAUCE: Don't register vga16fb framebuffer if other framebuffers are present

This actually can be done from user space:
  63da13e UBUNTU: SAUCE: Disable function tracing after hitting schedule_bug

Should already be upsteam as its in stable:
  e9c6db3 UBUNTU: Disable 4MB page tables for Atom, work around errata AAE44
  (upstream commit id 7a0fc404ae66)

Drop for upstream version:
  cca014d UBUNTU: SAUCE: sync before umount to reduce time taken by ext4 umount

Drop as it really should not be needed:
  0990173 UBUNTU: SAUCE: Enable an e1000e Intel Corporation 82567 Gigabit controller

Create work-item to investigate this on [canonical-kernel-team]
  0ec500e UBUNTU: SAUCE: Add MODULE_ALIAS for Dell WMI module

Attempt to upstream else put in inittools: 
  c4f1d8a UBUNTU: SAUCE: ipw2200: Enable LED by default

Now done correctly, drop:
  7da19fb UBUNTU: SAUCE: Created MODULE_EXPORT/MODULE_IMPORT macros
  1980cfa UBUNTU: SAUCE: Fix MODULE_IMPORT/MODULE_EXPORT

should have been dropped last cycle:
  e7a2b3c UBUNTU: SAUCE: input/mouse/alps: Do not call psmouse_reset() for alps
  fa85688 UBUNTU: SAUCE: r8169: disable TSO by default for RTL8111/8168B chipsets

Discuss on #ubuntu-kernel
  5a78bd7 UBUNTU: SAUCE: hostap: send events on data interface as well as master interface

Chase to investigate, did this get a generic upstream mode, and remember to convert usersapce first:

  2e04f7f UBUNTU: SAUCE: trace: add trace events for open(), exec() and uselib()

Upstream:
  f6ad91e UBUNTU: SAUCE: Make CONFIG_{OMNIBOOK, AVERATEC_5100P, PACKARDBELL_E5} depend on X86
** ogasawara: it doesn't make sense to push this upstream as this is specific to drivers in our ubuntu/ directory.  So, we need to keep it as a SAUCE patch.

Drop, this is transitional:
  e0f61cb UBUNTU: add Breaks: against hardy lvm2

Drop and see who howels:
  0a64e18 UBUNTU: SAUCE: Guest OS does not recognize a lun with non zero target id on Vmware ESX Server

=== Driver Review ===

Apparmour should be resync'd with upstream version, drop aa patches and re-pull, waiting on upstream

AUFS: depeant on union-mounts

compcache: get userspace confirmed as fixed wtf to new semantics and if so drop

action:
 create work items for updating each of these driver
 work item for re-checking them just in time for beta2
 use hw db to find the high use items
 request testing ubuntu driver for each milestone
 circle round with OEM to see if there is a high pentration driver requirement
