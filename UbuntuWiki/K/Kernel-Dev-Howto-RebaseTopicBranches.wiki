==== Rebasing Topc Branches ====

For the purpose of this example we will assume the following:

* You are rebasing the ec2 branch onto the master branch.
* The master branch contains the tag "Ubuntu-2.6.32-29.58" at the point where you want the rebase.

1. Clone a new copy of the Lucid kernel tree
 <pre>
 git clone zinc.canonical.com:/srv/kernel.ubuntu.com/git/ubuntu/ubuntu-karmic.git
 </pre>

1. For purposes of this example we will be rebasing the ec2 topic branch
 <pre>
 cd ubuntu-karmic
 git branch --track ec2 origin/ec2
 </pre>

1. Before rebasing the ec2 branch it must be prepared. If a "start new release" has not been performed upon it, that must be done.
 <pre>
 git co ec2
 maint-startnewrelease
 git co master
 </pre>

1. Do the rebase.
 <pre>
 maint-rebase-branch ec2 Ubuntu-2.6.32-29.58
 </pre>

1. Once the rebase completes successfully, inspect the rebase. You should be currently in a temporary topic branch named "auto-tmp-rebase".

1. Once you are satisfied that the rebase worked the way you wanted, fixup the actual ec2 topic branch.
 <pre>
 git co ec2
 git reset --hard auto-tmp-rebase
 </pre>

1. You can now go on to finish up this branch for release and testing.

==== To Do: ====
1. Create another wiki page that show how to do this without using the script for the times the script fails.
