* Bug reporting and triage

* I debianised <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/dapper/+source/dcfldd|dcfldd]]</nowiki> and created a few other <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/people/kduffus/+packages|packages]]</nowiki> as well as submitting patches that were applied

* Testing of CD and DVD dailys and candidates

* I am a member of <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/people/kubuntu-team|Kubuntu Team]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/people/bugsquad|Ubuntu BugSquad]]</nowiki>

* Editing of some wiki pages

* I started and continue to work on <nowiki>[[http://behindubuntu.org|Behind Ubuntu]]</nowiki> interviews
