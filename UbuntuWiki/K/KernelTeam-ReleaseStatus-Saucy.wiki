==== What was done engineering wise? ====
Our master branch for Saucy continues to track v3.10 final.  We'll
continue in this holding pattern until the v3.11-rc#'s begin appearing
and we are able to evaluate moving to v3.11 for Saucy.

==== What's about to land that might impact the other teams and release as a whole? ====
We are beginning to prepare for the 12.04.3 point release.  Testing of the Raring HWE stacks which will be shipped in the 12.04.3 Precise point release (Aug 22) would be much appreciated.

==== Dependencies on other teams to make deliverables, blocking items, release wide concerns? ====
