__TOC__

KeybukMake (for lack of a better term) is an idea that ScottJamesRemnant and MartinPitt are working on.  Basically it's a replacement for autoconf, automake, libtool, etc. that fixes much that is wrong with those systems.

Possible Features:

* simple, clean, consistent syntax
* rules file per-directory
* support both recursive and non-recursive builds
* support parallel builds
* may not rely on auto-generated output
* "All the world must be Linux by now" design, we don't need to support 1920s-era AIX :-)

Ways of doing it (pick one):

* configure-like program to write Makefiles
* make-like program to read rules and build program
* magic Makefile rules (cdbs-like?)

Existing systems which do not look crackful right from the start:

* <nowiki>[[http://boost.org/boost-build2/|bjam]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[http://www.dscpl.com.au/projects/makeit/|makeit]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[http://www.scons.org/|scons]]</nowiki> (seems to be powerful, used by KDE, but rules are written in Python code, so they aren't very readable)
