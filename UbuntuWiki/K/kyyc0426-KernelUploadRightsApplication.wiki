== Who I am ==

My name is Kuan-Ying Lee, and I have been a member of the Ubuntu Kernel Team
since May 2024.

I am currently responsible for maintaining the Ubuntu OEM kernel, and I have also contributed some patches to the mainline Linux kernel. I obtained my Master's degree in Computer Science from National Chiao Tung University in 2019.

== My Ubuntu story ==

I first encountered Ubuntu in 2013 during my undergraduate studies in an OS design course that required us to use a Linux-based system for development. This marked my initial exploration into the world of Linux.

During my graduate studies, many of my experiments also required running in a Linux environment, and I continued to use the familiar Ubuntu system throughout the kernel development process.

Since joining Canonical, Ubuntu has become the default operating system on my laptop.

=== My involvement ===

I am currently responsible for tasks such as mailing list review, OEM kernel maintenance, Gitea patch review, and OEM staging kernel release

Thanks <nowiki>[[https://code.launchpad.net/~corytodd/+git/tools|@corytodd]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[https://udd.debian.org/cgi-bin/ubuntu-sponsorships.cgi|UDD]]</nowiki> for the generation of these tables.

=== Upload Rights ===

I'm requesting upload rights for the kernel package set for all active series, which includes all the "linux*" packages.

=== Timo Aaltonen ===
==== General feedback ====
I've sponsored a bunch of oem kernel updates for KY over the last four months, and the kernels have been generally spotless after the rather steep learning curve in the beginning.

I trust KY to continue doing great uploads on his own.

==== Specific Experiences of working together ====
There was a recent update of oem-6.11 which had to be redone to include some urgent OEM patches, so after a brief discussion this too was handled effortlessly.

==== Areas of Improvement ====
Better understanding on the lifecycle of the tracker bug, and how devel cycles are different to stable ones. But after our latest chat this should be clear now already :)

=== Portia Stephens ===
==== General feedback ====
I've reviewed Kuan-Ying's cranks of oem kernels. They have all been wtthout issue. Kuan-Ying is quick to ask question on topics he doesn't understand and I trust that he will not upload things he does not understand. I trust him with upload rights. 

==== Specific Experiences of working together ====
I reviewed the oem-6.5 kernel cranks when 6.5 was being EOL'd and There were lots of complications that he handled very well. I also onboarded Kuan-Ying and worked with him on his initial kernel cranks. He was very thorough and quick to clarify topics that were not clear. 

==== Areas of Improvement ====
None
