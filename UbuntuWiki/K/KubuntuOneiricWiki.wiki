=== Summary ===

The Kubuntu Wiki theme needs to be updated to either match the current Kubuntu Website theme or to a theme using the current Kubuntu logo, artwork and colour palette.

=== Rationale ===

We need to integrate our websites' branding so as to give our users a consistent experience. Consistent branding will also lead to a better image.

=== Design ===

We will look at implementing a design by Thomasz Dudzik (sheytan) or by another member of the community.

=== Implementation ===

The branch lp:~kubuntu-website/kubuntu-website/kubuntu-wikitheme can be used as a base for the implementation.

Once implemented and tested, we will need to ask the sysadmins to install it on wiki.kubuntu.org.
