=== How do you manage and track incoming patches? ===

Patches are submitted to the Ubuntu kernels via the <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/kernel-team|kernel-team mailing list]]</nowiki>.  We use this list as the primary record of the discussions, acceptance, or rejection, of each patch (see <nowiki>[[''Where can we find your Mailing List?''|Kernel-FAQ-GeneralMailingList]]</nowiki>).  We use the ''patchworks'' patch tracking system to aid in this process  <nowiki>[[http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/ubuntu-kernel/list/]]</nowiki>.  See <nowiki>[[Kernel-Handbook-Patchworks]]</nowiki> for documentation on how we use patchworks within the team.
