=== My system is reporting very high temperature, what can I do about this? ===

Temperature is normally managed by the BIOS on your system.  Under some circumstances this can be affected by the system for example the workload on it.  For some hints as to how to confirm you have a real issue and report any issues see <nowiki>[[Kernel-Debugging-HighTemperatures]]</nowiki>.
