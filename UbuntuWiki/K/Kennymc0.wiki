=== About Kenny McHenry (kennymc0) ===
I just graduated from De``Vry University with a Bachelors of Science degree in Electronics Engineering Technology at the end of October 2008. I'm looking forward to putting degree to good use in the technology field. I haven't been able to find a job in my field yet, but am looking and hope to find something soon.

I have been heavily involved in the Boy Scouts since I was 12. I worked hard and by February 2003 I earned the rank of Eagle Scout. Then I started spending most of my time in scouts with the Order of the Arrow. The order of the Arrow or O/A for short is the national honor society of scouts. During my time with the O/A I have achieve the Vigil honor, which is the highest honor you can receive in the O/A. I have also been a Chapter Chief and now am an advisor for one of the Vice Chiefs in the chapter. For the O/A you are considered a youth till you are 21, but after I turned 18 I became an Assistant Scoutmaster. I still participate in both my troop and the O/A as much as i possibly can.

I was born in Dallas, Texas, but my parents had to move when I was 2 and a half years old so I don't remember it. We moved to a small town in northern Alabama where we lived for about 6 years, and then for another year we lived in Wisconson for about a year. We then moved from Wisconson to Arizona, where we have lived for 12 years.

==== Background ====
I have been using Ubuntu since version 6.06 Dapper Drake almost 3 years ago if I got my dates right which was a couple of months before I started at De``Vry, and I have been using it ever since. I have been switching back and forth between Ubuntu and Kubuntu and have liked both. Both my laptop and my desktop are running dual boot with Ubuntu and that Windows XP. I still don't trust Vista in any form other than in a virtual machine.

=== Current Level of Involvement ===

==== Team Memberships ====

===== Arizona LoCo Team =====

* Member Since:  October 18, 2007
* Ubuntero
* I advocate Ubuntu by handing out CDs to family friends, etc. I try to carry a few Ubuntu CDs with me everywhere that I go.
* Active in IRC on channels #ubuntu-us-az, #plugaz, #ubuntu-news on freenode. I help whenever I can, and help lighten the mood with a well timed joke or two. Sometimes it doesn't work as well as planned. Like: Why was the tomato red? .......Because it saw the salad dressing.
* Helped plan and find the location for the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArizonaTeam/HardyReleaseParties|Hardy Release Party]]</nowiki>. Passed out fliers before the event to help with participation. During the party I helped pass out CDs, and explained what Ubuntu was about and the Lo``Co team did to anyone that wanted to know.
* Helped with planning the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArizonaTeam/Installfest|Hardy Install Fest]]</nowiki>. Also participated in the event, passed out fliers before hand, brought needed equipment for the event, and helped people install Ubuntu on their computers.
* Helped plan <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArizonaTeam/OpenSourceConference|AbleConf]]</nowiki> which was a collaborative effort between all the state Open Source groups. Also brought tables, and computers to the event for the team booth. Helped presenters with setting up their presentations in the conference rooms, and helped in any other way that I could.
* Helped plan <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArizonaTeam/Installfest/Intrepid-Phoenix|Phoenix Intrepid Install fest]]</nowiki>. I also participated in the event, and took pictures and helped out wherever I could.
* Helped plan <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArizonaTeam/Installfest/Intrepid-Tucson|Tucson Intrepid Install Fest]]</nowiki>. I also participated in this event, took pictures, and helped however I could.
* Team Website Administer - Helped build the new <nowiki>[[http://12.159.65.82/drupal/|Team Website]]</nowiki>. The site will be live on Friday February 20th and is currently running in a test environment on one of our team servers.
* Team Scribe - <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArizonaTeam/Meetings|Arizona Team Meetings]]</nowiki> - Post logs from meetings for the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArizonaTeam/Teams/Newsletter|Newsletter Team]]</nowiki> to use. Wasn't done on a consistent basis till I took over.

=== My Goals With Ubuntu ===

* To support and promote Ubuntu to the best of my abilities.
1. By continuing to offer support and encouragement through my presence in IRC
2. By continuing to pass out CDs to anyone I can.
3. By continuing to participate in future Release parties, Install fests, and any other events where I can promote Ubuntu.

=== Testimonials ===

Kenny has done fantastic work at the LoCo level with the Arizona Team. He attends every weekly meeting, takes care of the scribe work, participates in all the events, and is always willing to lend a hand. He is now working on the Ubuntu Weekly Newsletter Team and has brought that same willingness to help in any way to the newsletter team. Kenny lives by the Ubuntu Code of Conduct and I highly recommend him for Ubuntu Membership. JohnCrawford

Most of interaction with Kenny has been with his work on the UWN. He is always looking for ways to help out and his work is greatly appreciated. - NickAli

I have known Kenny since he came into the Arizona Lo``Co.  As a matter of fact, it's at least partly because of me that he joined, and I'm glad he did.  He has proven himself to be resourceful and a hard worker - always willing to take on a new task, even if he has to be taught how to do it.  And I've worked with him on the UWN, and taught him the basics of what needed to be done.  He picked it up and ran with it.  I think he would be a great candidate for Ubuntu membership, and an example to others. - CraigAEddy (tyche)
