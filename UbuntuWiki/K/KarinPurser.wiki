__TOC__

Aka MotherLUG.  

I am very passionate about making sure that everyone has a fair chance in this world, no matter what nationality, financial position, religion or social status.  

I talk to people about Ubuntu and Edubuntu every chance I get.  I would love to see Ubuntu out there in the homes of everyday people that do not have disposable incomes. 

I am also a mother of 3.  Timothy (7), Erin (2) and Rowen (10 months).  I want my children to grow up with the correct values in this world and FOSS is a fantastic thing to introduce them to early in life.
