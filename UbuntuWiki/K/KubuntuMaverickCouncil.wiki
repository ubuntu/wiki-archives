=== Summary ===

Changes to the Kubuntu Council in Maverick

=== Council ===

==== Rules ====

The Kubuntu Council membership is 6 members.  Membership lasts for two years.  Three members change each year.

Votes are by a positive vote of all council members.  If a member isn't present for a vote he or she can vote later.  The council administrator has a casting vote.

==== Actions ====

The three longest service members will stand down and elections held for the vacant positions before the end of May.  We will follow the process listed on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommunityCouncil/Restaffing

We will write a description for desirable characterists in a council member to go out with the call for nominations.

=== Other Community Actions ===

We will organise a Kubuntu Tutorials Day.

We hope to organise more bug days probably alongside the Ubuntu Hug Days.
