__TOC__

A couple of tools that would ease the process of mass deployment of Kubuntu by OEMs and collection of configuration data from a user whose computer comes pre-loaded with Kubuntu.
=== OEM Installer ===
This is a program which would be launched when a computer with Kubuntu pre-installed is started for the first time. Through a clean and attractive interface, It would allow for the collection of information from the user, which would include:
* The User's Location and language(locale)
* The Keyboard layout in use
* The User's Name, preferred username, password(and confirmation);(and email if necessary)
* The User's timezone

Based on the information collected, the installation would be configured accordingly and a new user account would be  created.

=== OEM Configuration Tool ===
A unified tool which would bring together common configurable aspects of the system, which can be tweaked
with ease by an OEM. Modules would include:
* Hardware: Addition/Modification of drivers etc.
* Installation/Removal of packages
* Configuration of the System; configure filesystems, network interfaces, configure X etc.
* Configuration of KDE; everything from widget style, icons to wallpaper(OEMs could install own packages to customize).
* Configuration of the OEM Installer.
* Creation and replication of disk images.

=== Design & Implementation ===
** '''Stage 1:''' Create a KDE port of the existing glade based interface.
** '''Stage 2:''' Modify existing code to create a common code base which can then be extended by a Qt/GTK interface (as required by Kubuntu/Ubuntu). Create a KDE/Qt front-end.
** '''Stage 3:'''  Create a  tool which provides a central location to configure various Hardware, Software(including KDE) options, install/remove packages, control what the user enters on first boot. Again a common backend which could be extended by a Qt/KDE interface.
