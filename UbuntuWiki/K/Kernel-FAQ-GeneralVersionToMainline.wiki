=== Given an Ubuntu kernel package version how do we find the exact mainline release it is based on? ===

The exact upstream mainline tag from which the Ubuntu kernels were forked can be found in the <nowiki>[[http://people.canonical.com/~kernel/info/kernel-version-map.html|mainline kernel mapping]]</nowiki> table.
