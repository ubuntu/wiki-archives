=== Which kernels does the Kernel Team support? ===

The Kernel Team provides support (security updates etc) for the Ubuntu kernels on all currently active releases, we do not support any non-Ubuntu kernels. A full list of the currently active releases can be found on the <nowiki>[[Releases]]</nowiki> page. For <nowiki>[[LTS|Long Term Support]]</nowiki> (LTS) releases, starting with Ubuntu 12.04, the desktop kernels and server kernels both receive five years support, this is reflected in the <nowiki>[[Releases]]</nowiki> page.
