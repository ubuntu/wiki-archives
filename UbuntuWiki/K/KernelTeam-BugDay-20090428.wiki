== Canonical Kernel Team Bug Day ==

The focus of today's bug day will be a combination of bugs with patches as well as old incomplete bugs.  Each developer has a list of 20 bugs to focus on.  There is also a community section for anyone else wanting to help out.  The goal will be to handle the bugs as follows.

=== Bugs With Patches ===
# Confirm the bug does indeed have a patch attached
# Evaluate if the patch is upstream or already in the latest Ubuntu kernel.
## If the patch is not upstream, inquire why (see Stock Reply)
## If the patch is upstream but not in the Ubuntu kernel, consider a cherry-pick from upstream.  Determine if the patch is also SRU worthy.
## If the patch is already available in a released Ubuntu kernel mark the bug Fix Released.

=== Old Incomplete Bugs ===
# If the last comment is more than 6 weeks old and the requested information has not been provided, close the bug as Won't Fix (see Stock Reply)
# If the requested information has been provided, make sure the latest Jaunty release has been tested (see Stock Reply)
# If the issue has been confirmed against the latest Jaunty release, move the bug from Incomplete to Triaged (or In Progress if you want to work on the bug).

== Tools ==
Here are references to some useful tools that may help you more efficiently process the list of bugs.

=== greasemonkey ===

https://launchpad.net/launchpad-gm-scripts

http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~gm-dev-launchpad/launchpad-gm-scripts/master/files

This is a collection of greasemonkey scripts which Launchpad users and Ubuntu developers have found useful.  For the purpose of Bug Day's, the <nowiki>[[http://bazaar.launchpad.net/%7Egm-dev-launchpad/launchpad-gm-scripts/master/annotate/head%3A/lp_stockreplies.user.js|stockreplies gm-script]]</nowiki> will be the most useful.  The stockreplies script allows you to save custom comments to insert into bug reports and additionally set the status and importance of a bug at the same time.

=== launchpadlib ===
https://help.launchpad.net/API/launchpadlib

The launchpadlib library depends on wadllib, another open-source library released by the Launchpad team. Get a copy of the launchpadlib and wadllib source with bzr and install it.
<pre>
  $ bzr branch lp:wadllib
  $ cd wadllib
  $ sudo ./setup.py install
 </pre>
Then do the same for launchpadlib.
 <pre>
  $ bzr branch lp:launchpadlib
  $ cd launchpadlib
  $ sudo ./setup.py install
 </pre>

After installation you can write custom scripts to manipulate bug reports.  This is useful for dealing with a list of bugs which all require the same type of actions/comment.  For example, here is a <nowiki>[[http://qa.ubuntu.com/reports/ogasawara/lplib/stock-reply.py|stock-reply.py]]</nowiki> script which reads a list of bugs from a "stock.txt" file, posts a standard comment to each bug, transitions the status to Incomplete, and subscribes oneself to the bug report.  It's quicker to use a launchpadlib script for this rather than having to do a page load per bug in order to use the greasemonkey stockreplies. 

== Stock Replies ==
Here's some common stock replies that may apply to some of the bugs:

=== Bug with Patch not Upstream ===
<pre>
This patch does not appear to be upstream.  It creates a significant amount of extra work for the Ubuntu kernel team to maintain out of tree patches.  As such they typically require patches to be submitted and accepted upstream first.  Do you know if the patch referenced here has gone upstream?  Please let us know.  Thanks.
</pre>
* Set status to Incomplete

=== Old Incomplete ===
<pre>
This bug report is being closed because we received no response to the previous inquiry for information. Please reopen if this is still an issue in the current Ubuntu release, Jaunty Jackalope 9.04.  To reopen the bug, click on the current status, under the Status column, and change the status back to "New".  Thanks.
</pre>
* Set status to Won't Fix

=== Test Jaunty ===
<pre>
Unfortunately it seems this bug is still an issue.  Can you confirm this issue exists with the most recent Jaunty Jackalope 9.04 release - http://www.ubuntu.com/news/ubuntu-9.04-desktop .  Please let us know your results.  Thanks.
</pre>
* Set status to Incomplete
