=== Feedback ===

Followed one of the tutorials?  Let us know if you leart something new or if it was too difficult or simplistic.

* That was great - jriddell
* Awesome, simply awesome, we totally gotta do this again. Sometimes it was hard to follow though (due to crosstalk) - apachelogger
* Good stuff, but the chatter was a HUGE drawback and brought things way down. I'd suggest something like the methods used in OpenWeek where only specific people have voice and another channel people submit questions through a moderator. - rharding
* Well done. A lot of interesting tutorials. Please offer a list of programs to install beforehand if needed next time. - Nightrose
* The PyKDE/QT tutorial was really good, and IMO, very wanted by the community. -- Nosrednaekim
* ''<your opinion, suggestions, etc. here>''
