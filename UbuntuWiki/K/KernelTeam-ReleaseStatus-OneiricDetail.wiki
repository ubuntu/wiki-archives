| How to free more CD space for the extra software which we'll need to add: unity 2D with Qt (10.6 MB at the moment) probably GTK 2 and GTK 3 until the transition is fully done, possibly python 3, bigger mesa drivers due to LLVM requirement, deja-dup. Magnitude of 30 MB.  Note that this does not cover the install media itself. This is discussed at https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/foundations-o-great-cd-debate

| General session to discuss how and when new X.org bits will be integrated in Oneiric.  Should we stay with xserver 1.10.x or plan to move to 1.11?  With Oneiric+1 being an LTS, it suggests being aggressive at updating to the newest X to maximize testing.  On the other hand, if 1.11 brings ABI changes (like 1.10 did) then we risk breaking the proprietary drivers, since they tend to lag their support weeks or months after an X release.  Do you have an opinion?  Please come.  Other topics for oft-requested features:   * Range of hardware models to provide development support (declining bug reports for ancient hardware)   * Hybrid graphic system stabilization   * Post-release updates for proprietary drivers (SRUs vs. Jockey+x-updates)   * 3D for -nouveau   * Tablet auto-rotate input with screen (https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/desktop-o-auto-rotate)

| For the next cycle I'd be great if we had better jack detection for audio. What this means to a user would basically be things like:   * plug an (audio capable) hdmi monitor in, and audio is automatically rerouted to go through HDMI   * plug a headphone in, and not only will the speaker mute, but also, the profile will change so that when you then change the volume, it'll affect the headphone's volume rather than the speaker's volume   * in addition, Nvidia's HDMI has four codecs, and this will remove the need to configure which one is the right one manually   * might be even possible to configure things like line-out being muted on headphones plugged in, like some of our users and customers expect, but I'll leave this without promise for the time being.   * also without promise would be a solution to bug Bug:771150 - to add a dialog box and/or impedance sense for determining what a jack should be used for, or reconfiguration possibilities...?  There are some bits and pieces implemented here and there, but we still need to pull them all together, implement a few missing pieces probably, decide with upstream how this is going to work, etc.

| The firmware test suite (fwts) is missing some features that were not implemented in the Maverick release and there have been requests for newer features to be added for the 11.10 Oneiric release. These need discussing and selecting the correct priorities and feature set.

| Suspend S3 and Hibernate S4 debug is notoriously difficult and the pm-debug via the RTC only goes so far.  S3/S4 debugging is tedious and time consuming, so it seems sensible to spend some effort in developing kernel debug that can help with debugging.  We should develop more flexible debugging to enable us to get state out of machines when we don't have the luxury of serial console or JTAG.

As our goal is to make it more efficient with each cycle, this cycle will focus on 2 key groupings of kernel bugs Development and SRU.

| Even when user namespaces are fully implemented, there remains the concern that containers share an OS with the host, and may be able to exploit syscall vulnerabilities (in particular) to gain access to and privilege in the host.  Historically, relatively new syscalls in particular, have ended up with vulnerabilities which a container would be able to exploit.  It would be nice if we could deny a container from using certain system calls, perhaps by a method analogous to seccomp.  http://lwn.net/Articles/332438/ described plans for such, and a suggestion to combine seccomp with ftrace instead.  http://code.google.com/p/seccompsandbox/ describes what google ended up using for chrome on linux instead.  http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/capsicum/ describes the approach used on freebsd.  http://git.chromium.org/gitweb/?p=kernel-capsicum.git;a=summary is a port to linux.  These are very useful for sandboxes in general, but not ideal for this lxc concern.  This blueprint, then, is for following, helping and testing, or initiating the seccomp+ftrace approach.
