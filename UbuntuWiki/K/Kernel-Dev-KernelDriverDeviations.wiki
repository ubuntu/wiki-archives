== Overview ==

This page tries to document which drivers in Ubuntu kernels have been modified substantially before release. It lists the driver and its source and version (if it is known). Only changes to drivers in mainline are listed. Additional drivers should be contained in the ubuntu subdirectory.

=== Ubuntu 10.04 LTS (Lucid) ===

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| Driver/Subsystem
| Source
| Reason
|-
| drm
| Upstream kernel 2.6.33
| Graphics bugs were claimed to be not fixable in 2.6.32. All upstream had moved to .33 and abandoned .32.
|-
| sfc
| Upstream kernel 2.6.33
| Was requested in order to support newer servers and driver had changed beyond a point to SRU it later.
|-
| thinkpad-acpi
| Upstream kernel 2.6.34
| Only the selected driver supported the alsa representation of the hardware mixer which would be a requisite to handle volume events correctly.
|-
| hid-ntrig (multi-touch)
| Upstream kernel 2.6.34
| In order to be a development ground for multi-touch, this driver was needed.
|}

=== Ubuntu 10.10.10 (Maverick) ===

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| Driver/Subsystem
| Source
| Reason
|-
| intel_ips
| Upstream kernel 2.6.36-rc1
| Support some power management feature present in latest Intel hardware. Risk was low due to it being an independent driver.
|-
| HID/Input (multi-touch)
| Upstream as of 2.6.36-rc1.
| Ongoing effort to be bleeding edge of multi-touch. Only exception is "UBUNTU: SAUCE: hid: 3m: Simplify touchsreen emulation logic" which is not a long term solution nor appropriate for upstream
