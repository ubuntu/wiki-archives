== About me ==

My name is Guilherme Kunigami, 23 years old. I'm from Brazil.

I'm a 5th year Computer Engineering student at University of Campinas (Unicamp) and have good knowledge of C and C++, some knowledge of Java and C# and also a basic knowledge in Python. I also know a little about web development including PHP and Javascript.

My academic interests are mainly in Combinatorial Optimization, Computational Geometry, Computer Graphics and Image Processing. I'm also interested in software development. I also like to contribute do open source softwares. My current focus is on Scilab, a mathematical software. I've been helping in translation and fixed some bugs.

I use Ubuntu/Linux since 2005 when I entered university.
