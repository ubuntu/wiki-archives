==== Interpretation ====
* every blue node is a parent package with one or more dependent packages
* top level depends on every parent package to bottom level
* packages of a specific dependency level might or might not depend on all prior parent packages
* in any case the closest parent will depend on any number of prior parents, but at least its closest parent and kdelibs
* everything depends on kdelibs

==== Changes ====
* KDE 4.2.85 added kdebase-workspace-dev as a build dep on kdebase (folderview). If this changes, we can move dep back to kdelibs. [rgreening]
* KDE 4.2.98 added kdebase-runtime as a build-dep for kdeadmin and dropped kdepimlibs as a direct build-dep for kdepim since it also build-dep on kdepim-runtime.  Updated the blue boxes.  ScottKitterman
* KDE 4.3.80 remove kdelibs-experimental and update deps accordingly. [rgreening]
* KDE 4.3.80 kdepim-runtime depends on kdebase-runtime (so you can't build kdepim without kdebase-runtime) and kdeutils needs kdebase to run. ScottKitterman
* KDE 4.3.85 kdepim-runtime and kdeadmin no longer need kdebase-runtime to build. JontheEchidna
* KDE SC 4.5.0 kdeadmin and kdeutils don't need to depend on kdebindings (although people keep adding it for some reason)
* KDE SC 4.5.2 (and probably before) kdebase-workspace needs kdebindings
* KDE SC 4.5.85 kdenetwork needs kdebase and kdebase-workspace now and kdeartwork needs kdegraphics. PhilipMuskovac
* KDE SC 4.5.85 (and before) kdesdk needs kdebase
* KDE pim 4.4.8 (and before) needs neither kdepim-runtime nor kdebase-runtime as build-deps
* KDE SC 4.5.85 (and before) move kdeadmin back to just depending on kdepimlibs as that's all it depends on.
* KDE SC 4.6.80 Rewrite graph for the package split. PhilipMuskovac
* KDE SC 4.7.80 Add draft for 4.8 PhilipMuskovac
* KDE SC 4.8.1 Fix dep for konsole and rename mobipocket into kdegraphics-mobipocket
* KDE SC 4.8.80 Add draft for 4.9
* KDE SC 4.10.80 add kdenetwork, kdeadmin, kdegames and kdesdk splits
* Add kactivities and kdepimlibs need nepomuk-core June 25, 2013 - ScottKitterman
* Just about everything needs kactivities or nepomuk-core now, added print-manager - July 11, 2013 - ScottKitterman
