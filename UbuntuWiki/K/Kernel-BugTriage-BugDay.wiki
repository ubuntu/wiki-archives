/BugTriage/BugDay.

=== Current Bug Day ===
==== Tuesday March 8th, 2011 ====

Selection of bugs to triage - <nowiki>[[https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bugs?field.status%3Alist=NEW&field.tags_combinator=ALL|New Bugs]]</nowiki>

The above list of bugs need the following:
** Basic triage (New to either triaged or confirmed status)
** appropriate subsystem tagging (kernel-core, kernel-net, etc.)
** requests for testing against mainline, current release or development version as appropriate
** basic identification of importance (Critical, High, etc.)

If you are unsure how to do any of the above, or if you would like to know how to accomplish one 
or several of the above items, you can reach the kernel team via FreeNode IRC in the #ubuntu-kernel
channel. Alternately, you can reach JFo in the above channel or by e-mail: jeremy@ubuntu.com

Please don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions.
