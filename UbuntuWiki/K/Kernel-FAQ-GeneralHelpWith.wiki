=== What do you need help with? ===

We need help with all aspects of the maintenance of the kernel.  Probably our biggest project is triaging all of the incoming bugs filed against the Ubuntu kernel, you can help us to categorise these and get the necessary information to allow a developer to work on them, see <nowiki>[[Kernel-BugTriage]]</nowiki> for information on how you can help.
