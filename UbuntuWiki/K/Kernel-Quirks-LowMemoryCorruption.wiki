=== Symptom/Bug report ===
If you see a bug report that says
<pre>
Corrupted low memory at ffff880000005df0 (5df0 phys) = e47700000000 
</pre>

or 

<pre>
"Corrupted low memory at" kernel warning on resume
</pre>

Most likely this is related to bad bios or buggy bios. 

=== How to Quirk this in kernel. ===
The fix is to add the bios "vendor" or "board" information to the List of systems that have known low memory corruption BIOS problems.

* This list can be found in arch/x86/kernel/setup.c
* Scroll down to where it says in comments "List of systems that have known low memory corruption BIOS problems."
* You could match by DMI_BIOS_VENDOR or DMI_BOARD_NAME, you need to make the judgment as to which one is appropriate. You can find leads to which to use by looking at what is currently listed.
* Build a kernel and get it tested by the originator of the bug.
* Submit to Ubuntu Kernel Team <kernel-team@lists.ubuntu.com> and cc stable@kernel.org.
