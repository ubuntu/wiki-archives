== Mac Enablement Notes ==

This page contains notes regarding the kernel team's effort to enable a sampling of Apple hardware.

=== Mac Mini 5,2 (CID 201112-10198) ===

==== Hardware Configuration ====
* '''CPU''': Intel Core i5-2520M (SandyBridge) @ 2.50GHz, 2 cores x 2 threads
* '''Memory''': 4 GB
* '''Storage''': TOSHIBA MK5065GS
* '''Graphics''': ATI Technologies Inc NI Whistler [AMD Radeon HD 6600M Series] [1002:6741]
* '''Audio''': Intel Corporation 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset Family High Definition Audio Controller [8086:1c20]
* '''LAN''': Broadcom Corporation NetXtreme BCM57765 Gigabit Ethernet PCIe [14e4:16b4]
* '''WLAN''': Broadcom Corporation BCM4331 802.11a/b/g/n [14e4:4331]
* '''SD Host Controller''': Broadcom Corporation NeXtreme BCM 57765 Memory Card Reader [14e4:16bc]
* '''Firewire''': Texas Instruments XIO2213A/B/XIO2221 IEEE-1394b OHCI Controller [Cheetah Express] [104c:823f]

==== Known Issues ====
* Sometimes hangs when trying to suspend (s3) or resume from suspend, not yet sure which.
** Bug in broadcom wireless driver, now fixed in precise.
* Broadcom wireless driver (b43) does not support 802.11n for the chipset used in this machine.

=== MacBook Air 4,1 (CID 201112-10196) ===

==== Hardware Configuration ====
* '''CPU''': Intel Core i7-2677M (SandyBridge) @ 1.80GHz, 2 cores x 2 threads
* '''Memory''': 4 GB
* '''Storage''': 120 GB SSD
* '''Graphics''': Intel HD 3000 [8086:0116]
* '''Audio''': Intel Corporation 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset Family High Definition Audio Controller [8086:1c20]
* '''WLAN''': Broadcom Corporation BCM53224 802.11a/b/g/n [14e4:4353]

==== Known Issues ====
* Power usage is high, about 10.5 to 11 W on average on an idle desktop. Enabling RC6 support in the i915 driver saves about 3 W, while the pm-utils changes currently being tested shave off another 1 W.
** This has improved during precise development. Now in the 7 W range so long as RC6 is enabled.
* Display artifacts are seen from time to time.
** Has improved during precise development, I'm no longer noticing these.
* Wireless cannot use DFS frequencies in 5 GHz band
** Workaround: Set regulatory domain manually

=== MacBook Pro 8,2, ATI graphics (CID 201112-10200) ===

==== Hardware Configuration ====

* '''CPU''': Intel Core i7-2675QM (SandyBridge) @ 2.20GHz, 4 cores x 2 threads
* '''Memory''': 4 GB
* '''Storage''': Hitachi HTS54505 500 GB HDD
* '''Optical''': MATSHITA DVD-R UJ-8A8
* '''Graphics''': ATI Technologies Inc NI Whistler [AMD Radeon HD 6600M Series] [1002:6741]
* '''Audio''': Intel Corporation 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset Family High Definition Audio Controller [8086:1c20]
* '''LAN''': Broadcom Corporation NeXtreme BCM57765 Gigabit Ethernet PCIe [1434:16b4]
* '''WLAN''': Broadcom Corporation BCM4331 802.11a/b/g/n [14e4:4331]
* '''SD Host Controller''': Broadcom Corporation NeXtreme BCM57765 Memory Card Reader [14e4:16bc]
* '''Firewire''': Agere Systems FW643 PCI Express1394b Controller [11c1:5901]

==== Known Issues ====
* Sometimes hangs trying to suspend (s3). This is being caused by the radeon driver.
** Now fixed in precise.
* Screen flickers after LVDS panel is turned off and back on. Being tracked on https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=44955.
** Now fixed in precise.
* When machine is resumed from S3 without AC power applied, the wireless becomes unable to associate with any networks. Reloading b43 fixes the issue.
* 802.11n is not yet supported with this wireless chipset (b43 lacking 802.11n support with HT phy).
* Power draw is excessive when using the radeon driver, ~30 W on an idle desktop. Drops to ~15 W with fglrx. According to upstream devs the power management support in radeon just isn't on par with fglrx at this point.
* Cannot adjust display brightness. Support is available using various versions of gmux support available online.
* Gain on internal microphone is extremely low, even when set to max volume using sound settings.
