One week when I was home sick from school, I helped my family launch their computer company, ZaReason, building laptops, desktops, and servers that all run Ubuntu. It was Beryl that got us all hooked on the OS. I also work as an Open Moko developer. I love my phone. I am trying to figure out how to get a cell card to work in the PCMI Express Card slot on the MegaLap so I can play WoW in the car whenever I have to go somewhere.
