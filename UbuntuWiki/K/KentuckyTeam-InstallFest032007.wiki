=== Post Event Status ===

The Install Fest is over and we had a GREAT turnout!  We had almost 30 people with representatives from the UKLUG, PLUG, and Ubuntu-Kentucky Team as well as a few people who just happened to hear we were going to be there.  We learned a lot from this first try and hope to have many more in the future!  Our next Fest is tentatively scheduled for September.  Here are some pictures of the event happily taken by p0g0:
