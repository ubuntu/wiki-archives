20:03 <     etank> O'Reilly UG
20:03 <     etank> about a month ago I signed our team up on this thing
20:04 <     etank> basically it gives members a 35% discount when ordering O'Reilly books online and using the DSUG coupon code
20:05 <     etank> they will also give us some free stuff to use at conferences and install fests
20:05 <     etank> including free books that we can use as door prizes to entice others to come
20:06 <     etank> and if anyone is interested in writing a review of their books then they will send us some for free
20:06 <     etank> all we have to do is read it and then provide an honest review of it
20:06 <    bkingx> Awesome!
20:06 <     etank> any questions
20:06 <     rdagi> What kind of books?
20:06              >>> rtkeeling_!n=rtkeelin@adsl-216-078-201-219.sip.sdf.bellsouth.net

20:07 <     rdagi> Let's hope
20:07 <     etank> i sent an email in the mailing list earlier
20:07 <     etank> https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-us-ky/2007-August/000081.html
20:07 <     etank> ^^ that has more detail
20:07 <    bkingx> I wanted one for ESX, but I didn't see one.
20:07 <     etank> they have them bkingx 
20:07 <     etank> the thing is im not sure if they will let us review their older books
20:08 <    bkingx> OK, get one for ESX 3
20:08 <      Zuph> It's "VMWare Infrastructure" now.
20:08 <  venomous> bkingx, you running VI3??
20:08 <    bkingx> Oh, OK.
20:08 <    bkingx> at IBM we are.
20:08 <    bkingx> I hope to have it here soon.
20:08 <     etank> you can purchase books from http://www.oreilly.com/store/
20:09 <     etank> i have ordered 3 for review so far
20:09 <     etank> 1) Title: Ubuntu for Non-Geeks
20:09 <     etank> 2)  Title: Windows Vista Accelerated
20:09 <     etank> 3) Title: Security Power Tools
20:09 <  venomous> etank is such a geek!
20:10 <   jkeyes0> how do you order for review?
20:10 <     etank> you know me well 8^)
20:10 <     etank> each month they send out an email
20:10 <     etank> i just respond to it and tell them what books we want to review
20:10 <     rdagi> I may be interested in title #1, since I am a newbie.
20:11 <     etank> we can write the review and post it to a blog, our team site, mailing list, newletter, whatever
20:11 <     etank> i can get them shipped to others too
20:11 <     etank> instead of my address
20:12 <     etank> the thing is if we get them to review i think we can only get one copy of the book
20:12 <    bkingx> Hmm...can't find VMWare Infrastructure.
20:12              <   w4ett!n=chatzill@24-159-74-250.dhcp.jcsn.tn.charter.com ["ChatZilla 0.9.78.1 [Firefox 2.0.0.4/0000000000]"]
20:12 <     etank> but we can pass it around
20:12 <    bkingx> Zuph: see if you can find it
20:13 <     etank> bkingx: http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/1886411727/index.html

20:14 <      Zuph> Freenode kicked me!
20:14 <     etank> i would like to put one of these on our site too http://ug.oreilly.com/banners/
20:14 <     etank> once the site is back up that is
20:14 <    bkingx> Good resource, I think our members should really take advantage of this.
20:15 <     rdagi> Do you get free coffee with the site add?
20:15 <     etank> especially if we can get free swag for our events
20:15 <     etank> rdagi: i dont think so
20:15 <  srwalter> poo, that says Vcc, not ground
20:16 <      Zuph> rdagi: where in KY are you located?
20:16 <      Zuph> srwalter: Oh no! Don't let the magic smoke out!
20:16 <  srwalter> hehe.  its a GPIO pin, so no worries
20:16 <     etank> magic smoke is gooood
20:16 <     rdagi> Nicholasville
20:16 <      Zuph> etank: Not that kind of smoke
20:16 <     rdagi> That's about 20 min for Lexington's mall
20:17 <      Zuph> rdagi: Shame.  I would take you up on coffee any day, but you're in freaking not Louisville
20:17 <     etank> Zuph: i meant the kind that is inside servers and stuff
20:17 <      Zuph> etank: ah
20:17 <     etank> ready for the next agenda item?
20:17 <      Zuph> yep
20:17 <   jkeyes0> Zuph, depending on how the next few weeks/months go, I might be in louisville a lot more...
20:17 <     etank> LUG Style meeting date
20:17 <      Zuph> jkeyes0: Give me a call.  I'm always down for lunch / coffee
20:18 <  srwalter> I'm up for most any evening or weekend
20:18 <     etank> we have a tenative date set for Oct 5th from 6 - 8
20:18 <     etank> at East Side Technical 
20:19 <  srwalter> where's that?
20:19 <     rdagi> Help the newbie: LUG?
20:19 <     etank> http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Eastside+Technical+Center&hl=en
20:19 <      Zuph> Linux Users Group
20:19 <     rdagi> Thanks
20:19 <      Zuph> I prefer weekends for the distance issue.
20:20 <     etank> thats why i wanted to set it so far out
20:20 <     etank> to make sure we can get the schedule right
20:20 <     etank> i can see about making it on a different day if that works better
20:20 <     etank> maybe Oct 6th
20:21              Zuph +1 on Oct 6th.
20:21              jkeyes0 +1
20:21 <     etank> jkeyes0: what date?
20:21 <     etank> who is up for the 6th over the 5th?
20:21 <     etank> and if it has to be the 5th can you still make it?
20:21 <   jkeyes0> sorry. oct 6th. of course, at this point, who knows? I have nothing planned for either day, but saturdays are always easier than fridays.
20:21 <   jkeyes0> if it has to be the 5th, I can still make it
20:21 <  srwalter> 6th
20:22 <     rdagi> I could probably do either given enough notice.
20:22 <      Zuph> I cannot make the 5th.
20:22 <     etank> noted
20:23 <    bkingx> 6th would prob be better for me too.
20:23 <     etank> bkingx, venomous, klb, how about you guys
20:23 <    bkingx> But I'll try to be there regardless.
20:23 <     etank> is the time good or would earlier be better
20:23 <     rdagi> 6 to 8 is ok with me
20:23 <  venomous> preference would be for the 6th
20:24 <   jkeyes0> if it's on the 6th, earlier would work too, since it's saturday
20:24 <      Zuph> jkeyes0: Negative!
20:24 <   jkeyes0> k
20:25 <      Zuph> Saturday morning are for sleeping off hangovers!
20:25 <     etank> oh i meant more like 4 - 6
20:25 <     etank> not "morning"
20:26 <   jkeyes0> yeah, that was what I was implying
20:26 <      Zuph> I can get to Lexington by 2-3, so any time after then is fine.
20:26 <     etank> k
20:26 <     etank> i will get with Mike about it
20:26 <     etank> the plan for the meet is to discuss gpg
20:27 <     etank> show the command line, a couple of gui, and its alternatives
20:27 <     etank> and then have a key signing
20:27 <     etank> we will rely on srwalter for most of the clo
20:27 <     etank> *cli that is
20:27 <     etank> :)
20:27 <  srwalter> woohoo, key signing!
20:28 <      Zuph> You people can teach me about this "encryption" business and the whole "security" thing.
20:28 <  srwalter> you must be a windows user, Zuph
20:28 <     etank> haha
20:28 <      Zuph> Only casually! I swear it!
20:28 <     etank> jsut dont inhale it
20:28 <     etank> it'll kill ya
20:29 <     rdagi> But he did not inhale.
20:29 <     etank> and make people laugh at you
20:29 <      Zuph> I usually stick to the good shit!  The Linux shit!
20:29 < queenofth> oddly, in this case, the cheaper stuff is better
20:29 <     etank> ooh so true
20:30 <     etank> last topic:
20:30 <     etank> Ohio Linux Fest

20:32 <     etank> and it goes more than one day
20:33 <     etank> but i could be wrong with that
20:33 <    bkingx> Or possibly camping at MammothCave

20:34 <     rdagi> I'm out on Ohio.  Be at a men's retreat in MO.
