__TOC__

I'm Kevin van Zonneveld(24), a lead developer and internet system engineer for an ISP in the Netherlands. In my spare time I program a lot and play with Ubuntu, new features, and read/write about it.

I've been using Ubuntu since 2005 and every new release since Hoary Hedgehog has made me even more enthusiastic about this Operating System. And so I recommend it to a lot of  customers and friends, and have even got my mother using it ;)

But I feel there's more I can do to help my favorite OS and give something back to the community. So I started a blog @ <nowiki>[[http://kevin.vanzonneveld.net]]</nowiki> where I advocate and post Ubuntu related articles and try to help others. And I'm just discovering more & more about the huge community, and looking for a good place where I can make additional contributions.
