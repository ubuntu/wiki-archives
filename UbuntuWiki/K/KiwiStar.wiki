'''Welcome to my little wiki here at wiki.ubuntu.com'''

''Finding Ubuntu''

I came across people selling Ubuntu 6.06LTS on <nowiki>[[http://www.trademe.co.nz|TradeMe]]</nowiki> and from there I did a <nowiki>[[http://www.google.co.nz|Google]]</nowiki> search and came across the Ubuntu website and basiclly from there I have not looked back.

''About Me''

I guess a little bit about me and what I do and where I am from.  Well I am from Whangarei in New Zealand and have spent 8 years in Wellington before shifting back north to Kaitaia to join my wife up here.

I have always been into computers but never really did anything about it, up untill I came north and now look after the computers at <nowiki>[[http://www.furnitureplus.co.nz|Furniture Plus]]</nowiki>.

''Where I'm From''

I'm am originally from a small city in New Zealand called Whangarei in the Northland region of the North Island.  I have since shifted from Whangarei to Wellington and now back to Kaitaia.
