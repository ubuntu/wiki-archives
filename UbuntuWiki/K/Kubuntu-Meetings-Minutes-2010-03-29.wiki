We welcomed David Wonderly (DarkwingDuck) and Roman Shtylman (shtylman) into Kubuntu membership.

=== Logo ===

We decided to trial this logo for beta 2
http://people.canonical.com/~jriddell/kubuntu-new-logo.png
and ask the Canonical Design Team to tidy it up so the lettering matches.

=== Liberation Fonts ===

We decided to change to Liberation fonts in line with Ubuntu Desktop

=== KOfficeUserReview ===

apachelogger said he wanted a survey of KOffice to see if it is ready to replace Open Office.  It was suggested to do this around the KOffice 2.2 release

Our widget theme uses modified colours compared to upstream.  We decided to revert to upstream's darker colour.
