=== How do I use git with the Ubuntu kernel? ===

<code>git</code> is a fairly complex program to use and you are recommended to read up on and understand <code>git</code>'s philosophy before attempting to work with the Ubuntu kernel trees, we recommend at least reading the <nowiki>[[http://book.git-scm.com/index.html|Git Community Book]]</nowiki>.  Once you are conversant with <code>git</code> you should read the <nowiki>[[KernelTeam-KernelGitGuide]]</nowiki> which describes how to find our respositories and how we use them.  You may also find the <nowiki>[[KernelTeam-GitCheatSheet]]</nowiki> useful.

There are also 2 books that we know of:
** Pragmatic Version Control Using Git by Travis Swicegood
** Version Control with Git by Jon Loeliger
