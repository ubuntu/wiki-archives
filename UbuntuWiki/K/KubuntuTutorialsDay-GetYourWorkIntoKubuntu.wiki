<pre>
[18:00] <dholbach> My name is Daniel Holbach, have been part of the MOTU for quite a while and try to make joining the Ubuntu Developers as easy as possible - if you have any questions during the tutorial, just ask
[18:00] <Riddell> folks, if you're having problems with the last talk, please wait an hour and ask for help then
[18:01] <thefoxx> and the package will not build anymore
[18:01] <apachelogger> or go to #kubuntu
[18:01] <dholbach> if you have any other complaints, ideas, suggestions, feel free to drop me an email
[18:01] <thefoxx> some minutes ago it worked but only with man pages
[18:01] <apachelogger> thefoxx: #kubuntu or query me
[18:01] <dholbach> so how do you get your changes into (k)Ubuntu?
[18:01] <dholbach> in the easiest case you have written a patch and want to get it in, so people on the whole world will benefit from it
[18:01] <nareshov> neat, it runs too (did a `sudo dpkg -i ../kraft_*.deb)!
[18:02] <dholbach> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PackagingGuide/Recipes/Debdiff is a tutorial to generate a debdiff for a simple change
[18:02] <dholbach> if we have time in the end, we can go through it together, for guys who have just packaged a .deb, it will be a piece of cake :)
[18:02] <nareshov> :)
[18:03] <dholbach> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SponsorshipProcess explains everything about getting patches into Ubuntu
[18:03] <dholbach> the process is quite straight-forward
[18:03] <dholbach> you will either follow up on an existing bug or file a new one against the package
[18:03] <dholbach> and attach your debdiff there
[18:03] <dholbach> please be clear about what your patch does, that way it's guaranteed to get in quicker :)
[18:04] <dholbach> then you will either subscribe ubuntu-main-sponsors (for packages that are in main or restricted)
[18:04] <dholbach> or subscribe ubuntu-universe-sponsors (for packages that are in universe or multiverse)
[18:04] <dholbach> does that make sense up until now?
[18:04] <cheguevara> aye
[18:04] <dholbach> those bug lists are triaged regularly
[18:04] <nareshov> aye
[18:04] <dholbach> http://people.ubuntu.com/~dholbach/sponsoring/ is a list of outstanding sponsoring request
[18:05] <dholbach> sponsoring means: somebody who is an ubuntu developer already will take your patch, apply it to the current source package, sign it with their gpg key, then upload it to the build daemons
[18:05] <dholbach> so what do we do for packages that are not in Ubuntu already?
[18:06] <dholbach> you can't attach a patch for a package that doesn't exist in the archive yet
[18:06] <dholbach> right now they get uploaded to REVU: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MOTU/Packages/REVU has more information on how to upload there
[18:07] <dholbach> REVU is a platform written by MOTUs that allows commenting and approving packages, looking at the diff of uploads, etc
[18:07] <dholbach> http://revu.tauware.de is what it looks like
[18:07] <dholbach> for being able to upload there, you need to add your GPG key to Launchpad
[18:07] <dholbach> and then join this team: https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-universe-contributors
[Note that ubuntu-universe-contributors has now been renamed to revu-uploaders, so the URL to join is https://launchpad.net/~revu-uploaders]
[18:07] <Fu86> MOTU?
[18:07] <dholbach> Fu86: good question
[18:08] <dholbach> MOTU are the Masters of the Universe
[18:08] <xRaich[o]2x> lol
[18:08] <Fu86> ;D
[18:08] <Artemis_Fowl> :-D
[18:08] <dholbach> MOTU is the onramp for becoming an Ubuntu Developer
[18:08] <nareshov> :D
[18:08] <dholbach> these guys have upload rights to universe and multiverse
[18:08] <dholbach> that's where for example NEW packages always start
[18:08]  * ubunturos had guessed, universe meant the repo (and not literally) ;)
[18:08] <dholbach> do we have MOTUs inhere?
[18:08] <dholbach> ubunturos: exactly :)
[18:09]  * apachelogger raises his hand
[18:09]  * dholbach spotted apachelogger and jpatrick before
[18:09] <dholbach> we need more MOTUs in here! :-)))
[18:09] <apachelogger> indeed :D
[18:09] <dholbach> yeah
[18:09] <DreadKnight> I'm on my way of becoming a MOTU ... a goal for the upcoming year ;)
[18:09] <nareshov> jpatrick fell of the internet :|
[18:09] <dholbach> DreadKnight: excellent news - let me know how it goes
[18:09] <dholbach> the process for becoming a MOTU yourself is quite straight-forward too:
[18:09] <DreadKnight> dholbach: :D sure
[18:09] <dholbach>  * you get a bunch of good uploads done
[18:10] <dholbach>  * until your sponsors have only good things to say about you and tired of them having to upload your stuff :-)
[18:10] <apachelogger> ^_^
[18:10] <dholbach>  * you apply for MOTU membership
[18:10] <cheguevara> :P
[18:10] <dholbach> that'S it
[18:10] <dholbach> no catch, nothing complicated :)
[18:10] <dholbach> http://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopers has more information on how you do it
[18:10]  * stdin adds "Become a MOTU" to his todo list (again)
[18:11] <dholbach> http://wiki.ubuntu.com/MOTU/GettingStarted has all the links you need to get started
[18:11] <dholbach> stdin: ROCK ON
[18:11] <dholbach> Fu86: I hope that answered your question
[18:11] <Fu86> yes, thanks!
[18:11] <dholbach> great
[18:11] <cheguevara> stdin, am sure Riddel is tired of uploading ur packages by now :P
[18:11] <dholbach> hehe
[18:11] <dholbach> alright... back to REVU
[18:11] <stdin> cheguevara: nah, saves him the work :p
[18:12]  * dthacker joins the contributors team.
[18:12] <cheguevara> would save him even more if u did it yourself :P
[18:12] <dholbach> as I said: if you've followed the instructions on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MOTU/Packages/REVU you should have no problem getting your package uploaded to REVU and it should get a review
[18:12] <dholbach> if you HAVE problems, be sure to join #ubuntu-motu and talk to the REVU admins about it
[18:12] <dholbach> you can also ask for reviews on #ubuntu-motu or ubuntu-motu-mentors@lists.ubuntu.com
[18:12] <Riddell> or here!
[18:12] <dholbach> right-o
[18:12] <Riddell> if it's KDE related
[18:12] <dholbach> sure
[18:13] <dholbach> it's also a good idea to file a bug saying "this app needs packaging" and assign it to yourself
[18:13] <dholbach> best to tag it as needs-packaging too
[18:13] <dholbach> that way people realize: somebody is working on this already
[18:13] <nareshov> ah
[18:13] <dholbach> you might notice that they show up on http://people.ubuntu.com/~dholbach/sponsoring/ as well
[18:14] <dholbach> packaging of completely new software isn't necessarily trivial
[18:14] <DreadKnight> the gnome MOTUS seem kinda lazy :D
[18:14] <dholbach> that's why it takes several iterations of reviews to get it completely right
[18:14] <dholbach> DreadKnight: I'm not sure about that :)
[18:14] <dholbach> anyway... some problems that new package have regularly are:
[18:14] <dholbach> mentioned on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PackagingGuide/Basic#CommonMistakes
[18:15] <dholbach>  * licensing and copyright problems
[18:15] <dholbach>  * repacked tarball (not the original one from the software homepage)
[18:15] <dholbach> and other bits you can find on that page
[18:15] <DreadKnight> :)
[18:15] <dholbach> getting debian/copyright right is the most important thing
[18:16] <nareshov> should be
[18:16] <dholbach> you have to make sure you check every copyright holder in every file in the tree
[18:16] <dholbach> make sure you list all the necessary licenses that that piece of software uses, etc
[18:16] <dholbach> Ubuntu can get in real trouble if that goes wrong
[18:16] <ubunturos> +
[18:16] <dholbach> that's why first the MOTUs check it, and after that the archive-admins
[18:17] <dholbach> I use the following short script to get an overview, when I do reviews
[18:17] <dholbach> http://daniel.holba.ch/temp/check-copyright
[18:17] <_nix_> quite a legalese involved there.. things should be much easiar in the mains repository
[18:18] <dholbach> _nix_: especially things that are in main are checked with more scrutiny
[18:18] <dholbach> _nix_: we can always remove software from the archive
[18:18] <_nix_> oh.. k
[18:18] <dholbach> try that with millions of pressed CDs
[18:18] <DreadKnight> :D
[18:18] <gourgi> lol
[18:18] <dholbach> in any case: be extra careful, ask others to check and you're fine
[18:19] <dholbach> more information on the whole copyright topic: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PackagingGuide/Basic#Copyright
[18:19] <dholbach> we have REVU Days in #ubuntu-motu every Monday
[18:19] <dholbach> so if your NEW package sits in REVU you might want to show up and ask for a review
[18:19] <dholbach> that makes the back and forth usually quicker
[18:19] <dholbach> after two MOTUs gave their OK to the new package, it gets uploaded
[18:20] <dholbach> any questions about NEW packages and REVU?
[18:20] <Artemis_Fowl> nope
[18:20] <DreadKnight> hmm
[18:20] <DreadKnight> me
[18:20] <nareshov> hmm
[18:20] <dholbach> DreadKnight: fire away
[18:20] <DreadKnight> what if i have a game project, using 2 licences
[18:20] <apachelogger> note: one can always ask me personally for a revu ;-)
[18:21] <dholbach> DreadKnight: where it's dual-licensed?
[18:21] <dthacker> dholbach: I'm working on packaging an app that debian pulled for copyright problems, which in turned caused it to fall out of Ubuntu,  Can I just build it for ubuntu if the problems are resolved?
[18:21] <dholbach> DreadKnight: if it says you're allowed to choose, you can choose
[18:21] <DreadKnight> like one for the engine, GPL and another for the graphics and stuff (which is not open source) ? can i have this as 2 different packages, like one from the main and the other from the multiverse or something?
[18:21] <apachelogger> dthacker: you should get the original debian maintainer to upload it to debian again
[18:21] <apachelogger> then we just sync
[18:21] <cheguevara> main can't depend on universe
[18:21] <dholbach> DreadKnight: if it just happens to include files that are for example GPL and others are LGPL, then make sure 1) both license texts are included in the tarball, 2) you mention everything in debian/copyright
[18:22] <DreadKnight> so for this example, in which repository would the game files end into ?
[18:22] <dthacker> apachelogger: he has orphaned the package
[18:22] <dholbach> DreadKnight: for multiverse it must be re-distributable
[18:23] <DreadKnight> dholbach: yes, but not re-editable
[18:23] <apachelogger> dthacker: well, it's still better to try getting it into debian, though if that doesn't work out you can do ubuntu I guess ;-)
[18:23] <dholbach> DreadKnight: so a is closed-source and depends on b that is open-source?
[18:23]  * dthacker would much rather work with ubuntu than debian, but if there is no other way....
[18:24] <DreadKnight> dholbach: something like that
[18:24] <dholbach> dthacker: sure there is: get it uploaded to ubuntu if it's blocked on something in debian
[18:24] <Riddell> dthacker: you can just get it uploaded to ubuntu
[18:24] <dthacker> ok, that's good to know.
[18:24] <dholbach> DreadKnight: in that case a would go to multiverse and b to universe
[18:24] <dholbach> DreadKnight: if it was the other way around, both would have to be in multiverse
[18:24] <dholbach> DreadKnight: universe can't depends on multiverse
[18:25] <dholbach> does that make sense?
[18:25] <DreadKnight> yes it does
[18:25] <DreadKnight> thanks :)
[18:25] <dholbach> ok rock and roll
[18:25] <dholbach> any more questions?
[18:25] <DreadKnight> um
[18:25] <DreadKnight> yeah
[18:25] <apachelogger> :)
[18:25] <wolfger> have we covered PPA yet?
[18:25] <apachelogger> wolfger: no
[18:25] <dholbach> DreadKnight: fire away
[18:25] <DreadKnight> can you be my menthor? :D
[18:25] <dholbach> wolfger: will be up next
[18:26] <limac> so what exactly does REVU stand for?
[18:26] <apachelogger> review
[18:26] <dholbach> DreadKnight: I'm not sure you'll be happy with me as your mentor, atm I'm very busy, but drop me a mail and we'll figure something out
[18:26] <limac> that's it
[18:26] <apachelogger> as in I review your package :P
[18:26] <limac> ?
[18:26] <DreadKnight> dholbach: that sounds good :)
[18:26] <dholbach> DreadKnight: great
[18:26] <limac> hahaha :d
[18:26] <dholbach> ok, moving on to PPA
[18:26] <limac> :D
[18:26] <sladen> limac: it's a sound-alike of the English word "Review"
[18:26] <limac> ah!
[18:26] <_nix_> ok PPA everyone
[18:26] <limac> hehehe
[18:26] <limac> PPA
[18:27] <dholbach> as most of you have realized: PPA are a great way to get packages built on a bunch of architectures and upload packages for testing
[18:27] <dholbach> the tutorial for it is available over here: http://help.launchpad.net/PPAQuickStart
[18:27] <sladen> Personal Package Archives, an apt repositary ("channel") hosted within Launchpad, for your own programs and software
[18:27] <nareshov> ah
[18:28] <dholbach> basically you have to 1) make sure you have everything set up in Launchpad correctly, 2) set up one local configuration
[18:28] <dholbach> it's explained quite detailed in the guide
[18:28] <dholbach> one thing that's quite important to point out is versioning
[18:28] <limac> i really need to go over the "creating a .deb package" tutorial again!!!!!
[18:29] <dholbach> you have to make sure you version your package correctly so upgrade paths still work
[18:29] <dholbach> let's suppose you upload a candidate revision of kmyapp 1.2.3, you want people to test it before that or your sponsor to review it
[18:30] <dholbach> the official version in ubuntu would probably be       1.2.3-0ubuntu1
[18:30] <dholbach> to have a version number that is smaller than that, we have the   ~  operator
[18:30] <dholbach> ~ is special as it makes     1.2.3-0ubuntu1~ppa1   smaller than    1.2.3-0ubuntu1
[18:31] <nareshov> oh
[18:31] <dholbach> also in a next iteration, you can still upload    1.2.3-0ubuntu1~ppa2   to PPA
[18:31] <dholbach> and the upgrade path will still work for your testers
[18:31] <dholbach> daniel@lovegood:~$ dpkg --compare-versions 1.2.3-0ubuntu1~ppa1 lt 1.2.3-0ubuntu1; echo $?
[18:31] <dholbach> 0
[18:31] <dholbach> daniel@lovegood:~
[18:32] <dholbach> dpkg --compare-versions    can sometimes be helpful for trying this out beforehand :)
[18:32] <dholbach> the other thing about  PPAs is the ogre model
[18:33] <dholbach> let's suppose you have a Kubuntu app that has a hell of a lot of build-depends in universe
[18:33] <dholbach> in that case, you will have to indicate that in debian/control
[18:33] <dholbach> so instead of       Section: web      you'd write something like        Section: universe/web
[18:33] <dholbach> to indicate: "please add universe if you try building my application"
[18:34] <stdin> dholbach: erm, not to interrupt, but there is no orge model in PPA any more
[18:34] <dholbach> stdin: there isn't?
[18:34] <apachelogger> nope
[18:34] <stdin> nope, it was removed
[18:34] <DreadKnight> what's this ogre model you guys are talking about?
[18:34] <stdin> "simpler for users"
[18:34] <dholbach> I stand corrected then
[18:34] <dholbach> thanks stdin, thanks apachelogger
[18:34] <dholbach> DreadKnight: forget about it :)
[18:34] <DreadKnight> xD
[18:34] <DreadKnight> done that
[18:34] <dholbach> DreadKnight: the important bit is the versioning then :)
[18:34] <dholbach> that's all there is to PPAs
[18:34] <dholbach> any questions about it?
[18:35] <DreadKnight> me
[18:35] <dholbach> shoot
[18:35] <wolfger> so nothing tricky about depending on Universe then?
[18:35] <wolfger> with Ogre gone?
[18:35] <dholbach> wolfger: no, doesn't look like it
[18:35] <DreadKnight> a PPA can automaticaly compile for an specific OS from the source?  like .deb files or .exe?
[18:35] <stdin> DreadKnight: PPA's only build debs
[18:35] <dholbach> DreadKnight: I don't know what the plans are, but until now it only builds for Ubuntu
[18:36] <DreadKnight> oh i see :)
[18:36] <DreadKnight> thanks
[18:36] <dholbach> what's nice about it, is that if you change         "hardy"        in debian/changelog entry to         "gutsy"        it will build the package against gutsy
[18:36] <nareshov> DreadKnight: build.opensuse.org for fedora et al
[18:37]  * stdin boos rpm, *boo*
[18:37] <nareshov> :D
[18:37] <DreadKnight> thanks, it's nice
[18:37] <apachelogger> wolfger: you package land in whatever it build-deps on - if it depends only on main apps it goes main, if it only depends on universe it goes there, etc.
[18:37] <dholbach> so you guys think you have an overview over the different methods of getting your stuff into Ubuntu now?
[18:37] <DreadKnight> but would be nicer for developers to build for other operating system as well
[18:37] <nareshov> yes, more-or-less
[18:37] <dholbach> the current state is a bit of a status-quo
[18:37] <dholbach> REVU for new package, bugs with patches for simple changes, etc
[18:37] <apachelogger> DreadKnight: opensuse's build service does that, but that one is also longer in developer
[18:38] <dholbach> I hope that we can move it all to launchpad at some stage
[18:38]  * apachelogger would love that too
[18:38] <DreadKnight> apachelogger: will check it out soon :)
[18:38] <dholbach> any more questions about becoming an ubuntu developer?
[18:38] <dholbach> or processes in ubuntu-dev land?
[18:39] <mzungu> yes...
[18:39] <dholbach> mzungu: fire away
[18:39] <dholbach> apachelogger: I have plans for ppaput (ubuntu-dev-tools) to not only do NEW packages, but also attach patches etc
[18:39] <mzungu> there is a program which has a .deb pacgage, but not in ubuntu
[18:39] <mzungu> it's not mine
[18:39] <mzungu> and upstream seems dead
[18:39] <dholbach> mzungu: .deb packages are unfortunately a bit worthless from a developer point of view
[18:40] <mzungu> but it is good, and i always load onto an ubuntu install
[18:40] <dholbach> we only do source uploads
[18:40] <apachelogger> dholbach: sounds good
[18:40] <mzungu> yes - there is source too
[18:40] <dholbach> so we upload the .orig.tar.gz, the .diff.gz and the .dsc file and the deb will be built from there
[18:40] <mzungu> but not mine, and apparently not maintained - but it works
[18:40] <dholbach> mzungu: then it's best to take a look at it, improve it and get it submitted to REVU
[18:40] <apachelogger> dholbach: don't we only include software which is active maintained?
[18:41] <dholbach> if you take over maintenance that's a great contribution to Ubuntu that's great
[18:41] <mzungu> ok - so should i email upstream to see what they have to say?
[18:41] <dholbach> mzungu: good idea
[18:41] <mzungu> ok - on it
[18:41] <dholbach> apachelogger: right, that's a good point too
[18:42] <dholbach> if you package a piece of software and intend to be the maintainer, you'll be the connection between upstream and kubuntu
[18:42] <dholbach> you really want to work with an active upstreams who deals with bugs, etc
[18:42] <apachelogger> so... keep an addressbook ;-)
[18:42] <dholbach> so I'd encourage you to make sure upstream is still alive :)
[18:42] <dholbach> any more questions?
[18:42] <dholbach> just keep on asking :)
[18:43] <limac> yeah kinda
[18:43] <dholbach> limac: fire away
[18:43] <dholbach> http://wiki.ubuntu.com/MOTU/GettingStarted is the best start I can think of for you to get "Master of the Universe" on your business cards
[18:43] <limac> well, actually nm; i found out the answer
[18:43] <mzungu> sure - but we always seem to have 'active' (read - always changing) stuff, and there's some other stuff out there which is stable and works, even if not maintained
[18:44] <Riddell> I had a few words about passing New queue
[18:44] <dthacker> dholbach: does ubuntu have an orphaned package list similar to debians?
[18:44] <dholbach> mzungu: we have some million users, there's always "something" about software :)
[18:44] <rick_h_> dholbach: should link to the guy doing the MOTU diary thing. Good wiki to follow
[18:44] <dholbach> dthacker: not that I know of
[18:44] <dholbach> dthacker: we maintain packages as a team, not as individual maintainer
[18:45] <dholbach> dthacker: MOTU takes care of an awful lot of packages, so there's not a real concept of orphaning packages, we remove software that is too old and too buggy in some cases though
[18:45] <dholbach> rick_h_: good point
[18:45] <dholbach> Riddell: fire away
[18:45] <Riddell> once a package has been reviewed on REVU and get uploaded
[18:45] <Riddell> it sits in New queue
[18:45] <Riddell> where it gets reviewed again by archive admins
[18:45] <Riddell> twice actually
[18:45] <Riddell> you can see the packages currently in New queue here http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-archive/queue/hardy/new/
[18:46] <limac> dholback: what exactly does a PPA do, I mean like what are its benifits
[18:46] <limac> ??
[18:46] <rick_h_> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/EfrainValles/MOTUJourney
[18:46] <Riddell> the main thing we look for is copyright issues
[18:46] <rick_h_> ^^ has done some good work making the MOTU journey a step by step process of learning
[18:46] <Riddell> we do reject a fair number of packages for copyright problems
[18:46] <Riddell> the packager than has to talk to upstream to fix those problems
[18:46] <Riddell> packages not including the full GPL are a common problem
[18:47] <Riddell> sometimes packages include the GPL but not the LGPL and have code under both
[18:47] <Riddell> unless we have the full licence we can't accept it
[18:47] <stdin> limac: I'd bet the launchpad build systems are a bit faster than your PC, and I'd bet they have better bandwidth too ;)
[18:47] <Riddell> same for FDL.  KDE packages have their docs under FDL usually, so it needs a full FDL to be let past
[18:47] <limac> ok
[18:47] <Riddell> we also look out for packages with overly generic names
[18:47] <limac> ;0
[18:47] <Riddell> or which make binaries with very generic names
[18:47] <dholbach> "mp3player" :)
[18:47] <Riddell> so a package called "hello" which makes /usr/bin/hello wouldn't pass
[18:48] <Riddell> guidance is an example, it got renamed to kde-guidance
[18:48] <Riddell> the other licencing issue I see a lot is non source files
[18:48] <Riddell> if it's GPL then you have to include the perferred modifiable form
[18:48] <yuriy> stdin: are they actually faster?  i've yet to try it but i was wondering, given the load, if getting a package built in a PPA is significantly faster or slower than building it on a fairly new pc?
[18:48] <Riddell> so for some artwork that means SVG not PNG
[18:48] <Riddell> for sounds that means oggs often don't pass
[18:49] <dholbach> yuriy: you have the benefit of it getting built on a bunch of different architectures
[18:49] <Riddell> as an archive admin I also look after approving backports, removing packages and other stuff, fell free to poke me on tuesdays which is my admin day
[18:49] <rick_h_> yuriy: the build time of a PPA is going to vary based on how busy the build servers are. Generally a few hours.
[18:49] <rick_h_> but you get packages for 64bit, 32bit, etc which is great for PPA users
[18:49] <Riddell> and file bugs subscribing ubuntu-archive
[18:49] <stdin> yuriy: so much faster it'll make your eyes bleed :p
[18:49] <Riddell> k, I'm done
[18:49] <dholbach> rock on
[18:50] <dthacker> Riddell: what about icons, also svg?
[18:50] <dholbach> thanks Riddell
[18:50] <Riddell> dthacker: it depends on how they're made
[18:50] <Riddell> dthacker: whatever the form the artists has made it in
[18:50] <Riddell> oh and archive admins are called ftpmasters in Debian land incase you're reading up on it
[18:51] <dholbach> another thing that comes to my mind, when you submit patches
[18:51] <dholbach> it's always good to add     (LP: #123456)   for the bugs that the upload will close
[18:51] <dholbach> that way the bug will automatically get closed when LP accepts the upload
[18:52] <apachelogger> ...in debian/changelog that is!
[18:52] <dholbach> exactly
[18:52]  * dholbach got up too early today
[18:52] <apachelogger> e.g. * Initial release (LP: #123456)
[18:52] <apachelogger> dholbach: me too ;-)
[18:52] <dholbach> tomorrow we'll have a MOTU Q&A at 13:00 UTC in #ubuntu-classroom
[18:52] <Riddell> limac asked what a PPA is.  it's a personal package archive on launchpad.  you can upload your source packages there and it will compile them into .debs for others to download
[18:53] <Riddell> it lets other people test your packages and is useful for new package or packaging beta software (like KDE 4)
[18:53] <dholbach> so if you check out http://wiki.ubuntu.com/MOTU/GettingStarted today and have questions, be sure to join us tomorrow and ask all the questions you have
[18:53] <Artemis_Fowl> I have a question:
[18:53] <dholbach> Artemis_Fowl: fire away
[18:53] <Artemis_Fowl> I have developed an application and I found out that some days ago:
[18:53] <Artemis_Fowl> http://packages.ubuntu.com/hardy/admin/qgrubeditor
[18:54] <limac> ah! thx Riddell
[18:54] <Artemis_Fowl> my app is on the hardy repos...
[18:54] <Artemis_Fowl> so,
[18:54] <apachelogger> Artemis_Fowl: I packaged it :P
[18:54] <Artemis_Fowl> apachelogger: really? :-P
[18:54] <apachelogger> yes
[18:54] <Fu86> :)
[18:54] <Artemis_Fowl> apachelogger: nice
[18:54] <apachelogger> ^_^
[18:54] <dholbach> apachelogger: meet Artemis_Fowl
[18:55] <Artemis_Fowl> apachelogger: well then I could discuss it with you
[18:55] <dholbach> Artemis_Fowl: meet apachelogger
[18:55] <dholbach> :-)
[18:55] <apachelogger> :D
[18:55] <apachelogger> Artemis_Fowl: sure, just query me
[18:55] <Artemis_Fowl> dholbach: thanks
[18:55] <dholbach> nice :)
[18:55] <dholbach> that's another thing: as MOTU you get in touch with a lot of people :-)
[18:55] <dholbach> users, upstream authors, debian maintainers, other distro maintainers, other ubuntu developers, etc
[18:55] <nixternal> I just got the feeling of introducing people that are related, but have never met before...almost an Oprah moment
[18:55] <dholbach> that's what makes it so gratifying
[18:56] <dholbach> nixternal: haha
[18:56] <jcastro> apachelogger: Artemis_Fowl: During Q+A (In ~6 minutes) I would like to discuss you guys meeting as a question.
[18:56]  * stdin takes the TV remote away from nixternal and leaves it on the 24/7 Oprah channel
[18:56] <dholbach> if there are no more questions, I'd say: see you at 13:00 UTC in #ubuntu-classroom tomorrow
[18:56] <cheguevara> btw https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bugs?field.tag=needs-packaging has a list of packages people requested to be packed
[18:57] <dholbach> get started: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MOTU/GettingStarted :-)
[18:57] <Riddell> oh and I have a bunch of extragear apps for KDE 4 that need packaged if people are wanting to get started
[18:57] <dholbach> cheguevara: yeah
[18:57] <cheguevara> *packaged
[18:57] <dholbach> thanks for all the good questions, hope to see you around in MOTU Land soon!
[18:57] <cheguevara> Riddell, hook me up :P
[18:57] <Riddell> cheguevara: ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/unstable/3.97/src/extragear/
[18:58] <Riddell> cheguevara: you can use extragear-plasma as a likely template
[18:58] <cheguevara> i'll take ktorrent
[18:58] <dholbach> have a great (rest of your) day :)
[18:58] <cheguevara> since i use it
[18:58] <cheguevara> thanks a lot dholbach
[18:58] <dholbach> anytime :)
[18:58] <DreadKnight> Riddell: ok, but i need a menthor
[18:59] <Fu86> thanks for this great tutorial!
[18:59] <dholbach> DreadKnight: that's not strictly required - just ask your questions in here, in #ubuntu-motu or on ubuntu-motu@lists.ubuntu.com
[18:59] <DreadKnight> is there actually a channel - packaging related?
[18:59] <dholbach> ubuntu-motu-mentors@lists.ubuntu.com I meant
[18:59] <dholbach> #ubuntu-motu
[18:59] <cheguevara> #ubuntu-motu
[18:59] <xRaich[o]2x> wow that are a lot of resources to work through for sure...
[18:59] <DreadKnight> dholbach: great :)
[18:59] <dholbach> rock on
[18:59] <DreadKnight> thanks guys
[18:59] <Riddell> thanks dholbach
[18:59] <dholbach> I mean        R O C K    O N !
[18:59] <cheguevara> dholbach, we'll make you proud
