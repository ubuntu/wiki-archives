'''This page describes what in Kubuntu Edgy 6.10 still needs console to make it works.'''

Also see <nowiki>[[KubuntuDapperWhatStillNeedsAConsole]]</nowiki>
Also see <nowiki>[[UbuntuDapperWhatStillNeedsAConsole]]</nowiki>

'''Mission: the primary mission for a desktop OS is to be user-friendly, and for newbie users console is NOT user-friendly, also for write very simple command.'''

'''It will be fantastic to see a distribution one day (Feisty or Feisty+1) that will can do all these stuff via GUI, unfortunately from Dapper to Edgy none of them were fixed, so Edgy is still console dependent as Dapper was :('''

== Adept ==
* to add the cd or dvd in the repositary you need a '' '''sudo apt-cdrom add''' '' <nowiki>[[http://launchpad.net/bugs/48098|#48098]]</nowiki>
* to install some packages that ask for a user interaction (ex. Java) you need a '' '''sudo apt-get install <package>''' '' <nowiki>[[http://launchpad.net/bugs/37696|#37696]]</nowiki>
*** Clicking on the details drop down will allow you to interact with the installation
**** No this method doesn't work in fact bug mentioned by me was fixed on 15/2/2007, if the problem really didn't exist then bug should be rejected instead of fixed isn't? The bug is fixed in Feisty but still present in Edgy
* to unlock adept because there are some packages unconfigurated due to a crash or a force-closed you need a '' '''sudo dpkg --configure -a''' ''
* to delete a bad repositary added by mistake you need a '' '''kdesu kate /etc/apt/sources.list''' ''
*** Alt+F2 -> kdesu kwrite/kate /etc/apt/sources.list (No console interaction performed)
**** Ok no console needed, however it's the same thing to type, what I want to say that is unfriendly have to type that line to have this feature
* to add a proxy you need a '' '''kdesu kate /etc/apt/apt.conf''' ''
*** Alt+F2 -> kdesu kwrite/kate /etc/apt/apt.conf (No console interaction performed)
**** Ok no console needed, however it's the same thing to type, what I want to say that is unfriendly have to type that line to have this feature
* to delete all .deb files downloaded you need a '' '''sudo apt-get clean''' ''
* to add an apt key (for example Jonathan Riddell's key) you need a

 '' '''wget http://people.ubuntu.com/~jriddell/kubuntu-packages-jriddell-key.gpg''' ''
 
 '' '''sudo apt-key add kubuntu-packages-jriddell-key.gpg''' ''

== KDE Guidance ==

==== System Services ====
* to add a script taken from the filesystem in the list you need a '' '''sudo update-rc.d <script> defaults''' '' <nowiki>[[http://launchpad.net/bugs/48417|#48417]]</nowiki> -> rejected
* to delete a script in the list you need a '' '''sudo update-rc.d <script> remove''' '' <nowiki>[[http://launchpad.net/bugs/48417|#48417]]</nowiki> -> rejected

== Packages ==

==== alien (and KDE integration) ====
* to convert a rpm you need a '' '''sudo alien <file>''' '' <nowiki>[[http://launchpad.net/bugs/48597|#48597]]</nowiki> -> Unbelievable rejected!

==== grub ====
* to install it in another hard disk you need a '' '''sudo grub-install etc.''' ''
* to modify the menu you need a '' '''kdesu kate /boot/grub/menu.lst''' ''
*** Alt+F2 -> kdesu kwrite/kate /boot/grub/menu.lst (No console interaction performed)
**** Ok no console needed, however it's the same thing to type, what I want to say that is unfriendly have to type that line to have this feature

==== samba ====
* to add a user you need a '' '''sudo smbpasswd -a <user>''' '' <nowiki>[[http://launchpad.net/bugs/16575|#16575]]</nowiki>
*** No console needed to add new user
***** KMenu->System Settings->Sharing - Select shared folder->Change... - More Samba Options - Users Tab - Add User
****** This is a method to add a user specific for one folder, not a generic user for all folders! As you can see bug exists and is confirmed in Ubuntu and in KDE upstream, why still try to be blind about links I provided?

==== kdm ====
* to disable theme and turn on users list in the login screen you need a '' '''kdesu kate /etc/kde3/kdm/kdmrc''' '' <nowiki>[[http://launchpad.net/bugs/40533|#40533]]</nowiki> or install kdmtheme, not in main
*** Alt+F2 -> kdesu kwrite/kate /etc/kde3/kdm/kdmrc (No console interaction performed)
**** Ok no console needed, however it's the same thing to type, what I want to say that is unfriendly have to type that line to have this feature

==== nvidia-glx ====
* to add/remove splash screen you need a '' '''kdesu kate /etc/X11/xorg.conf''' '' <nowiki>[[http://launchpad.net/bugs/32853|#32853]]</nowiki> -> splash screen isn't active in ubuntu packages
*** Alt+F2 -> kdesu kwrite/kate /etc/kde3/kdm/kdmrc
**** Ok no console needed, however it's the same thing to type, what I want to say that is unfriendly have to type that line to have this feature

== Network Connections ==

==== PPPoE ====

* to make DSL connections, one must type '' '''sudo pppoeconf''' ''

== Feedback ==
* I have noted that you do not need to use the console for quite a few of the listed issues. Please research information prior to posting as to limit the amount of FUD created. -- nixternal  * Probably you haven't understood at all the meaning of this page, in fact your goal wasn't understand the meaning, but only destroy my thesis, this is not so great and constructive.
** First of all adept and samba solutions provided by you aren't working or they work for another issue, so '''please research informations prior posting'''. 
** Second: if you have to type a long and unfriendly line in the console or in the ALT-F2 window please let me say the is unfriendly at the same identical point, so please understand the general spirit of this page that is a summary of what in general is unfriendly and I've written '''console''' to hope people understand that means '''all that is unfriendly for newbie user''', but if your only goal is to say "no it isn't true please research information" then you haven't understood the constructive goal of my page and of me, a guy that loves Kubuntu and want that spreads the world. -- Cimmo
