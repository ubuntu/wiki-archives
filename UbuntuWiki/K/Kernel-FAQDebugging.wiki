The aim of this page is to provide an list of common questions that we get.  We encourage you to update this document when something is missing so it becomes a core source of information for the project.  Each question has its own page which are listed on the <nowiki>[[Kernel-FAQEdit]]</nowiki> page, which also contains guidance on editing the FAQ.
