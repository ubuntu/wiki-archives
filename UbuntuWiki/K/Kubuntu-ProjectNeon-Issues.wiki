== Current Issues that Project Neon faces ==

* Currently some bindings build without QScintilla2 libraries even though the build-depend is added, looks like a internal issue with QScintilla 
* KDE PIM might not work completely, we're working on that 
* We are still working out issues with keeping the configuration separate from the stable kde one, a known issue there is akonadi still using ~/.config/akonadi, and setting XDG_CONFIG_HOME breaks kwin.
* If you want working KDEPIM:
   1. akonadictl stop
   2. export XDG_CONFIG_HOME=$KDEHOME/config
   3. mkdir -p $XDG_CONFIG_HOME
   4. akonadictl start
   Akonadi should work fine then.
* We don't have pykde currently, so no python support in neon
* Amarok is broken
    Short Version : Amarok cannot find qtscript generator once you set neon-env
    Long Version : Amarok cannot find qtscript generator since the qt.core extension is not installed in /opt/project-neon where CMake tries to     find it, here's a <nowiki>[[http://paste.kde.org/~pn/6137/|log]]</nowiki> of the issue.
* Shit is not installable in Debian - see <nowiki>[[http://paste.kde.org/725180/36605152/|here]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[http://paste.kde.org/725192/05172813/|here]]</nowiki>
