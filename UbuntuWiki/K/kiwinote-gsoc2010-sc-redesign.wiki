This is a gsoc project idea by kiwinote. Please ensure to read https://wiki.ubuntu.com/kiwinote/gsoc2010 first.

Please also note that this document is still a work in progress.
==== Current Issues ====

===== Inconsistent filtering =====
Software-center is a utility for installing and removing software in Ubuntu. Ubuntu has tens of thousands of software packages available. One of the key functionalities of software-center is to filter certain groups of these software packages. The current interface does not do this in a consistent manner (the behaviour described is approximate, not precise):
** the view menu filters between main and universe,
** the subitems of 'get software' filter per channel,
** the 'installed software' section filters on installation state,
** the 'featured apps' button filters on popularity,
** the (sub)categories filter on (sub)category,
** the search bar filters on word in title/description.
Notice how the appearance of all these interface elements varies significantly.

===== Inconsistent actions =====
Once someone has located one or more software packages, they would like to take an action on these packages. The most common actions are 'install', 'remove' and 'view details', but other possible actions are 'rate/review', 'launch' and the channel related actions 'use this source' and 'update now'. The current interface does not do this in a consistent manner:
** the file menu lists 'install' and 'remove',
** the list view lists 'more info' and 'install'/'remove',
** the details view lists 'install'/'remove'/'use this source'/'update now'/'review'.
Notice how the appearance of all these interface elements varies significantly. Notice also that the actions visible and/or sensitive in each of these interface elements is not consistent.

===== Performance =====
Upon filtering the software package listings a user expects an instant result. They do not want to wait for many seconds until the view has loaded.

===== Data Integrity =====
The current implementation of software-center puts a large emphasis on (sub)categories. Thousands of the software packages available are displayed in the wrong categories (even assuming the correctness of the categories themselves). Furthermore many software packages are displayed which are in reality only of interest as extensions of other software packages.

===== Extendability =====

==== Interface overview ====
The proposed interface attempts to deal with some of the issues described above. It is based on the following workflow:
* find items (software, (sub)categories, reviews, history, channels),
* select items (one or more),
* take actions on selected items (install, remove, etc).

<nowiki>[[File:overview.png|overview.png|width=400]]</nowiki>

===== Filter =====
This is used to filter items. Behaviour will be similar to normal search boxes and should 'just work'. 

Character input methods:
* keyboard,
* mouse (onscreen keyboard) (activate by holding down mouse over a character field for one second) (if time permits),
* stylus (character recognition) (if time permits).

<nowiki>[[File:finder.png|finder.png|width=400]]</nowiki>

===== Selector =====
We want a layout that makes full use of the screen area. At the same time we want the layout to be consistent, whether viewing lists of items or whether viewing item details. A column (with fixed width) based layout seems to work best for this. When there are more columns than fit on the screen, then an arrow is diplayed with which one can view the columns to the right (hold down mouse over arrow to go to first/last column):

<nowiki>[[File:selector.png|selector.png|width=400]]</nowiki>

====== Item lists ======
Upon clicking the title of the list, the selector will display only the items in that list (over multiple columns). View a list of items:

<nowiki>[[File:itemlist.png|itemlist.png]]</nowiki>

====== Item tiles ======
Thin border around item tile when selected. White glow behind item tile on hover. When an item is clicked on the first time, the item will be selected and the action list will display the actions available. If the item is clicked again within the double-click threshold time, then the first action will be executed. If the item is clicked again outside the double-click threshold time, then the item will be deselected.

<nowiki>[[File:itemselection.png|itemselection.png|width=400]]</nowiki>

===== Actor =====
This bar will list all actions that can be undertaken on the current selection. It will display at most 5 actions. If more than five actions are available then it will list 4 actions and a 'more actions' menu which lists all other actions. When necessary a 'return' action will be displayed completely to the left of the screen. Holding down this return button for one second will take you back to the 'home' screen.

==== Example: Install Google Earth ====
Rob has used Google Earth intensively in the past and would like to install it on his new os. He finds software-center in the menus and launches it:

<nowiki>[[File:figure1.png|figure1.png|width=800]]</nowiki>

He sees a prominent search field, so enters 'Google Earth' into the field. Software-center scans its data and finds two hits, which it displays, selecting the first one:

<nowiki>[[File:figure2.png|figure2.png|width=800]]</nowiki>

He knows that the selected item is the one that he wants to install, so clicks on the 'install' button. Google Earth has a non-free licence, so Rob must accept this licence first:

<nowiki>[[File:figure3.png|figure3.png|width=800]]</nowiki>

Although Rob doesn't understand much of the text, he clicks 'accept'. He is transfered to the details view of Google Earth where he can see that Google Earth is currently being installed.

<nowiki>[[File:figure4.png|figure4.png|width=800]]</nowiki>

He notices that once it is installed he has some new actions available:
> launch  > get help  > review  > remove.

==== Example: Install Google Earth ====
Sally was talking with her friends the other day about some cool pieces of software. One of her friends mentioned something about a product by Google which would allow her to view satellite images of her new house. She launches software-center.

<nowiki>[[File:figure1.png|figure1.png|width=800]]</nowiki>

She has used software-center quite a lot in the past and is slightly surprised by the new look. She quickly notices the 'Categories' column and chooses the 'Science & Engineering' category:

<nowiki>[[File:figure5.png|figure5.png|width=800]]</nowiki>

She sees that the 'geography' subcategory has a globe as its icon, so double clicks on that: she sees figure5, but with 'software' spanning the first two columns.

Google Earth is listed here, so Sally single clicks on it and notices the following actions:
> more info  > install.

She is pretty sure that this must be the product her friends mentioned, but decides to select 'more info' first, just to be sure. She sees figure4, with the action 'install'. She notices that her friend has reviewed it, so clicks install and continues as in Rob's example.

=== Data storage ===
Some data we want to store locally (packages per category, etc), other data we only want to store online (reviews, screenshots, etc). Some data is already stored locally, sometimes in convenient forms, sometimes in less convenient forms. The best way to store this data and to sync this data needs further thought (as we want local data to be accessible as fast as possible and we want as little data as possible to be transferred over internet).

=== Actions ===
This is an incomplete list of possible actions. Not all will be part of the gsoc project.

Software
* `install` install software
* `remove` remove software
* `review` review software (focus of canonical for this cycle?)
* `purchase` purchase software (focus of canonical for this cycle?)
* `launch` launch software
* `get help` submit question to launchpad answers
* `report bug` report a bug to launchpad
* `view` view software

Categories
* `view` display all software with given category

Providers
* `enable` enable a software channel
* `disable` disable a software channel

Reviews
* `view` view complete review with metadata
* `edit` edit one of your reviews
* `delete` delete one of your reviews

History
* `view` view history action with metadata
* `undo` revert history step
