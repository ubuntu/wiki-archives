== Apps discussion ==

This page is the place to discuss the replacement of default kubuntu apps. It's created to unclutter main Kubuntu future ideas page. Please include your nickname in your points so we can track the discussion.

=== Libraries ===

* I think we need to move away from only-QT or only-KDE apps, and offer the best apps there are. I think the aim of Kubuntu should be to offer the best KDE based desktop experience, not the best KDesktop experience, with K apps and K everything :) I would suggest the same for Ubuntu for example... including amaroK in the default ubuntu install because its better than Rhythymbox. -- AbhinayMukunthan
*** I don't agree. Kubuntu should be a free O.S. based on the vision driven by the KDE community with the solid base of the ubuntu core. That's what makes it different. You can always install other apps if needed. If for example ubuntu provided amarok as default then this will end up in a discussion of if we/they should include nautilus or konqui? .. etc. Ubuntu can make this kind of replacements as many apps default to the GTK toolkit and integrate better with gnome. Another point in favour of using KDE based apps is that the desktop is faster, lighter and more integrated. Making shuch move would make upstream angry/upset. -- kmon
***** As I have said below.. I think the aim of the project was, and still is to be a great OS for new and old users alike. And when it comes to new users, they should have applications that will work the best for them, as they may not learn how to install new apps for a long time. I think the issue needs more attention to detail, and a specific set of guidelines to determine which apps are essential to the DE, and which apps aren't. For eg. Nautilus is essential to Gnome, as is Konqueror to KDE. But These are as file managers. Its a bit of a blurry line, but I think its definitely somethinig that requires further discussion. Perhaps a better place to discuss will be here: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=191011 --AbhinayMukunthan

=== Office ===
* Replace Openoffice.org with Koffice (The neverending debate) -- kmon
*** A debate it is indeed! I still think Openoffice.org should be included by default, simply because Koffice isn't that ready yet. It cant open most Microsoft formats, and even opens Open Documents a bit differently. Openoffice is cross-platform, and so, if you send people an openoffice document, chances that they will be able to open it are greater than if you send them the same document with Koffice. Just a few thoughts. -- AbhinayMukunthan
*** Reasons for Koffice: It integrates better with the desktop. Also, OpenOffice is bigger and slower. Openoffice doesn't work well on pure amd64 enviroments. Since it's in main you can always install it if needed. Using Koffice will require less CD space and less libraries in memory while running KDE. -- kmon
*** I'm not entirely sure of the technical details of Koffice's compatibility, but the issue is whether it's 'good enough' for the user, not which is the best. I'm sure Openoffice has some features Koffice doesn't, but for the average Kubuntu user, is Koffice enough? I think it might be, and therefore worth using because of the integration. I haven't compared them enough to say, but now that opendocument is the default koffice format, interoperability with openoffice's files shouldn't be an issue.

=== Web browser ===

* Firefox as the default browser. Konqueror is amazing. It has come a long way, but it still doesn't render pages as well as Firefox. Gmail, for example still suffers from a strange lack of speed(and support, unless you change the User agent). Most Universities in Australia tend to use Mirapoint as their webmail service, and Konqueror doesn't load it at all. It still has trouble with some framesets that firefox and IE, etc support easily. -- AbhinayMukunthan
*** Please don't. Konqueror is the KDE browser. It integrates better with the desktop. Since firefox is in main, you can always install it if needed. Same reasons as Koffice. --kmon
**** The rationale behind placing firefox, and openoffice in the default installation is that they are at the moment, better than the qt based replacements. It isn't a matter of them being in the main repositories... It is a matter of whether the average user would know how to install it. Sample Scenario: Average New User tries to open his/her favourite page in Konquerer, and it screws up... They will not know what to do. This is a matter of usability IMO, not a matter of integration. Konqueror can always be present, as it is a damn good file manager. But still, it isn't as good a browser. Same goes by leaps and bounds in the Koffice vs OpenOffice Discussion. --AbhinayMukunthan
***** This is a matter of integration, though. Konqueror can use KParts to display PDF and image files in the browser in a way that Firefox can't. The kmplayer plugin wouldn't work with firefox - the only alternative seems to be the kaffeine launcher plugin, which only launches and doesn't display in the web page. If the default browser is firefox and a user clicks a link to an image in Kopete, the image will open in firefox. But, if the KDE defaults are used, that link will load in the user's image viewer. Not to mention things like the ftp kioslave, the file dialog, using the right click 'copy to' menu to save files on the web in the same way users use it in the file manager. Konqueror is deeply integrated in KDE and can do a lot of amazing things Firefox can't because of it.
