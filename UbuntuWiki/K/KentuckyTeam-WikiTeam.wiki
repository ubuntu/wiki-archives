=== Objectives ===

This team focuses on the clarity, organization, and content of KentuckyTeam wiki pages.  The team wiki, as a whole, should be intuitive and simple to navigate, so that all visitors can easily and quickly find what they seek.

If you have any questions, contact team leader <nowiki>[[KyleWright]]</nowiki>.

=== Team ToDo List ===

These pages need some love at this time:

* <nowiki>[[KentuckyTeam/WikiTeam|Wiki Team]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[KentuckyTeam/WebTeam|Web Team]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[KentuckyTeam/ApprovalApplication|Approval Application]]</nowiki>

One of our most important objectives at this time is our work on the <nowiki>[[KentuckyTeam/KnowledgeBase|KnowledgeBase]]</nowiki>.  It has come a long way, but there is still much left to compile.
