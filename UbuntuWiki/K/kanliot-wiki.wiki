===== Candidate for Lubuntu wiki coordinator =====

I want  help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu  to be readable and organized.  The wiki will immediately provide the high standards and high value that people expect from ubuntu.

* enjoys collaberation on wiki pages
* listens to different opinions
* active member 
* reads ubuntuforums.org

The wiki should:
 1. not contain duplicate pages
 2. does not delete precious information
 3. ensure that information for multiple versions of Lubuntu is clearly marked
 4. follow the leadership of the main ubuntu-docs team
 5. follow <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DocumentationTeam/StyleGuide|best practices]]</nowiki>.

The most recent wiki page I've completed was the new page for <nowiki>[[http://live.gnome.org/xpad|xpad]]</nowiki>
