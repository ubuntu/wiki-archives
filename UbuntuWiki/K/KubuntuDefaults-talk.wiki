why not set up kicker the same way it is for Ubuntu? maybe even with the MacOS-style menubar, to make better use of the upper panel. that's the setup I have now, and I find it rather nice.

wrt theme/style: I personally prefer the 'lipstik white' color scheme to the default plastik one, it's similar but lighter.

wrt konsole: disabling the frame and having the background color be the window color is a nice effect, as there's no visual gap between the tabs and the actual 'terminal area'. there's also a script somewhere to automatically change the tab titles to the current dir, which might be nice...

here's a screenshot, just to show what the colorscheme and konsole look like: {{http://illissius.uw.hu/download/plastikwhite.png}}

Message-ID: <20050312223413+0000@https://www.ubuntulinux.org>

Please turn it off on default, so words wrap to the window and not to 78 characters. I'm assuming it will still send correctly.

Also Konsole root window, since Root terminal works under Gnome I'm assuming there is someway to get this working.

No KGet? -- I think that is a definite no-no; kget is great. Think it's a shame that people don't generally know about it since it's not the default download manager with konqueror (unless you make it so). Still, to not have the option for it would be a bad idea, IMO. 

No menu entry for KWrite? -- though kate is out there, kwrite is decent. Has a few options -- with regard to ftp -- that kate doesn't. Not much harm in having a menu entry.

2 other things, that generally aren't done right.
Configure spell checking!! I always have to manually apt-get aspell. If possible have it point to an already installed spell checker or make aspell (or is it ispell?) a dependency. I think spell checking does make a big difference.
Also the power applet always complains that it has been modified and has a different checksum. It's done this on every version of KDE I've tried, if you select 'Setup Helper Application' in the ACPI config tab on the Laptop Battery applet and you'll see what I mean.

The smoothblend Window Decoration with Lipstik would look very good, and be distinct from other distrobutions. Nuvola is a much nicer icon set than Crystal I think.

Smoothblend is ok, but personally I'd prefer flatKnifty, Knifty, or Plastik (roughly in that order). The one in my screenshot is flatKnifty with the boxes-around-the-buttons part of the code commented out... if it is wanted I could clean it up a bit and release it maybe.

Subject: Great ideas here
Message-ID: <20050316090520+0000@https://www.ubuntulinux.org>

Although I think most of the Defaults suggested above are great I'm not so sure about one or two things that to me (as a mere KDE user) would go a bit too far. For starters that's not having desktop icons at all and removing the "Show Desktop" icon from Kicker completely.

I still think the desktop as a possibility to put program icons is a decent concept and there to stay and might as well be used. The argumentations for and against this have mostly been told so I'll not go into all the details.

I know that advanced users will be able to re-enable desktop icons by themselves – because they might for example remove the wastebin applet from kicker and use this space for something they *really* need to see all the time. But that's a question of focus and who you want to target as users.
It’s just that I think people with prior KDE experience might rather tend to have their wastebin on the desktop than "in the way" all the time. I don’t think some kind of wastebin applet is bad though – it's just not for everybody.

I'd strongly favour not to re-arrange the titlebar buttons (close, min-/maximize), because the way they are now is the way most people are used to and I just don’t see a point here.
Instead you could enable the "stay on top" button by default. This one could go to the left, just right to the program-icon. I think this one is useful – not sure what others think here.

KGet is immensely useful and should be there =)

What somebody already says: out-of-the-box Spell-checking would be a big plus. If possible keep in mind all the different languages a user might want to check against. On some distributions it's a bit fuzzy to set up e.g. german end English spell-checking side by side.

I do not really know the window decoration that is talked about here in the comments but I'd go for a rather simple one without fancy effects if Kubuntu is to be viable inside organizations and companies as well.

To clean up the Konqueror toolbars for both browser and file-management mode I'd suggest to remove the buttons copy, paste, cut and print. Not really more cause again long time KDE users will miss certain buttons and shouldn’t *have* to configure everything before they can use Kubuntu.

Now this is just me, but anyway: I like to display the "Show Navigational Panel" (F9) button to quickly enable/disable the sidebar.
Scenarios would be: Browsing websites in Fullscreen mode (disabled), Navigating the filesystem in a small window (disabled to see more directory content). Normal browsing with bookmarks or file-management (enabled). And so on.
The point is: A button on the toolbar is "always there" and doesn't shift locations, so it's easy to see and press. The buttons on the sidebar don’t fulfil that need. But it's a minor point really – just in case you want to consider this.

Another random comment: I like the word wrap in KMail and think it's a good default that aids readability, but again that might just be me.

Message-ID: <20050316111053+0000@https://www.ubuntulinux.org>

Didn't see this mentioned, but I hope the virtual Desktop Pager on Kicker will be there - virtual desktops are one of the reasons for people to favour whatever Linux desktop environment over Windows and similar systems.
My take: Put the pager with two Virtual Desktops only (unlike the default 4) right left to the taskbar.

Message-ID: <20050323141858+0000@www.ubuntulinux.org>

kolourpaint and ksnapshot are good apps, usefull and fast. I don't think they should be removed.

the kdict applet is very usefull. if we split the kicker (like ubuntu/gnome) which I think we should, it fits easilly.

check this screenshot: http://web.inter.nl.net /users/jospoortvliet/pictures/ konqueror_and_kicker.jpg (remove spaces to see it, I don't want it here permanently)
It shows the kicker split. with command executor and devices. on the bottom is the kdict applet, and the pager.

-- For local browsing, the locationbar should have (change toolbars)fiterbar->dirfilter->filterfield. it will appear on the same place as the (google) search bar, and narrow the view to matching files when you enter some text. Why doesn't everyone know this toolbar? Its a real gem...
the problem is it can't be integrated in the konqueror main toolbar. I've been playing with it, it really sucks... someone should give konqi's toolbars some love :D
you can see what it can do in the screenshot.

konsole white on black: go for "linux colors".  more relaxed on the eye.

Konsole: put tabs on top default.

I agree about the iconset, nuvola looks better than crystal.

Looking at the list of apps to be removed above maybe my suggestions aren't whats intended for kubuntu, but anyway these are my thoughts about some of the apps.

I appreaceate the idea to remove the kontact component application icons and encourage users to use kontact instead, but removing kget, kdf, kolourpaint...  I don't really understand the motivation.
From what I understand ksnapshot should only be moved out of "More applications", so it will still be there, but still the others will be removed, right?

I think especially kolourpaint and kget are more than jsut "useful" - they are vital parts of KDE. I wouldn't inted to make kubuntu another everything-but-the-kitchensink distribution, it's just that those certain apps are part of KDE and a good deal of thought should go into removing parts of KDE - just like it has gone into when they were first introduced to KDE. This is not really true for "3rd party" (non-KDE) applications, as those can't usually expected to be there by experienced KDE users.

I also thought that maybe kwrite is the better default text editor for "average users" because kate (though it's a great tool and personally I prefer it) tends to be a bit overwhelming for those that just want to have a look at some text file. Besides the way multi-document view is done in kate might be confusing for some, because opening a second text file to have a look at both side-by-side "overrides" the already opened one and it's not immediately visible where it's gone.

Message-ID: <20050410151346+0100@https://www.ubuntulinux.org>

Kolourpaint - should be retained
Kate/Kwrite - should be removed and KEdit be used

Why ? Because, Kwrite/Kate really does not work well for non-Latin texts (but Kedit does). Kolourpaint also works well with non-Latin.
