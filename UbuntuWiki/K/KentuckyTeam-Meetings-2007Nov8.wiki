<pre>
20:00 <     etank> lets get this party started
20:02 <     etank> bkingx_: you got this thing
20:03 <      Zuph> Clearly not.
20:03 <     p0g0_> Gentlemen, start your engines...
20:03 <     etank> darn you bkingx_ 
20:03 <     etank> alright
20:03 <     etank> tonight we are all about the next event
20:04 <     etank> it has been discussed some about having an install fest in Jan
20:05 <     etank> how does that fit with everyones schedule
20:05 < defishguy> What are the tentative dates?
20:05 <      Zuph> I don't have anything in January yet.
20:05 <      Zuph> defishguy: January.
20:06 <     etank> the question is how do we get the word out 
20:06 < defishguy> zuph:  <sarcasm>Maybe something a little more precise you know like oh I don't know maybe a particular day just as Jan 9, 2008</sarcasm>
20:07 < defishguy> Bring a friend competition?
20:07 <      Zuph> defishguy: We haven't considered any days at all.
20:07 <     p0g0_> January 1st at 1:00 am?
20:07 <     etank> p0g0_: as long as you run it :)
20:07 < defishguy> lol
20:07 <      Zuph> defishguy: It will probably be a weekend.
20:07 <     etank> one of the Saturdays
20:07 <      Zuph> January 5th, 12th, 19th or 26th?
20:07 <      Zuph> I would prefer the 12th right now.
20:08 <     etank> setting a date at this point isn't really the big thing
20:08 <      Zuph> Well
20:08 <      Zuph> Yeah, it is.
20:08 <     etank> we need to plan how we are going to do it
20:08 <      Zuph> Because we need to start getting word out
20:08 <      Zuph> Post haste.
20:08 <     etank> not to say that a date isn't important
20:08 <     etank> cause it is
20:09 < defishguy> The first thing I'm going to get asked is "when is it"
20:09 <     p0g0_> so if I run it, do I get to choose where to hold it too?
20:09 <     etank> poin tmade defishguy 
20:09 <      Zuph> How is everyone's January 12th?
20:09 < defishguy> The 12th works for me.
20:09 <     p0g0_> Mine seems fine, so far.
20:10 <     etank> that should work for me
20:10 <      Zuph> Okay
20:10              >>> jkeyes0!n=jkeyes0@host-067-131-053-222.dhcp.fewpb.net
20:10 <      Zuph> Bang the gavel, January 12th.
20:10 <     etank> around 3:00PM or so
20:10 <     etank> ???
20:10 < defishguy> 3 it is.
20:10 <     etank> hey jkeyes0 
20:10 <   jkeyes0> hey etank
20:10 <      Zuph> I dunno.
20:10 < defishguy> Hi jkeyes0
20:10 <   jkeyes0> hey fish
20:10 <      Zuph> Are we planning on running fairly late?  Because 3-7 seems reasonably, while 3-5 does not.
20:10 <     etank> jkeyes0: we have just decided to do an install fest on Jan 12th at ??:?? o'clock
20:11 < defishguy> 3 works for me.
20:11 <   jkeyes0> should be fine by me
20:11 <     etank> Zuph: i was kinda thinking a 3 hour event
20:11 <     etank> should we move it to 2:00 PM
20:11 <      Zuph> Capped off by Pizza or something?
20:11 <      Zuph> Because 3-6 doesn't seem bad
20:11 <     etank> Zuph: food is one way that we will draw people in
20:11 <      Zuph> Yeah
20:12 <      Zuph> 3-6, with Pizza at 5ish?
20:12 <     etank> sounds good
20:12 <   bkingx_> Hey guys
20:12 < defishguy> that works
20:12              ~   bkingx_ is now bkingx
20:12 < defishguy> hey bkingx
20:12 <     etank> what did we learn from the first event we did like this
20:13 <      Zuph> That we need srwalter to set up the ethernet bridge.
20:13 <    bkingx> that srwalter does good with presentations
20:13 <   jkeyes0> and he should bring a cheesecake. :)
20:13 <      Zuph> That srwalter is easily our most valuable member.
20:13 <     etank> one thing we learned was that we dont want to do two events back to back
20:13 <    bkingx> AMEN!
20:13 < defishguy> Huzzzah jkeyes0.  I agree!
20:13 <      Zuph> I had fun at the release post part :(
20:14 <     etank> Zuph: me too but it felt so rushed
20:14 <      Zuph> Yeah.
20:14 <     etank> do we want to do presentations this time?
20:14 <      Zuph> I think we should do a short walkthrough install.
20:14 <     etank> the one that i did was not good for the audience that we had
20:15 <      Zuph> And maybe show some people the finer points of fixing their broken xorg.conf files.
20:15 <     etank> what about opening it up to different distros?
20:15 <    bkingx> NO!
20:15 <     p0g0_> Yes?
20:15 <    bkingx> Foresite for losers?
20:15 < defishguy> I am in favor of that etank.
20:15 <    bkingx> LOL
20:15 <    bkingx> JK...different distros is fine.
20:15 < defishguy> That would make it Hindsite wouldn't it bkingx?
20:15 < Ubuntu-Ky> Hmmm. I think bkingx is now ScatterBrain's hero!
20:16 <     etank> i don't want to turn someone away that needs help with Fedora, Foresight, Suse or any other
20:16 <     p0g0_> Uhhm- who are you trying to attract?  Beginners, deep linuz geeks...what?
20:16 <     etank> p0g0_: any and all
20:16 <     etank> it would be a good way to grow the team no matter what
20:16 <    bkingx> Homeless guyy looking for free pizza?
20:16 <     p0g0_> so, talking up a presentation on ____ would attract the most peaple?
20:16 <     etank> except that bkingx 
20:17 <     etank> what kind of presentation p0g0_ 
20:17 <     p0g0_> If they can code for food, I'd be OK...
20:17 <     p0g0_> that is the 'fill in the balnk' part.
20:17 <     p0g0_> *blank
20:17 <      Zuph> etank: We will show them how to install Ubuntu, but if anyone comes with other Distros, we won't turn them away.
20:18 <      Zuph> Keeping in mind that a lot of the people coming to INSTALL will be coming because they don't know a damn thing about Linux.
20:18 <     etank> i agree with that Zuph 
20:18              >>> ScatterBrain!n=Kevin@64.191.170.164
20:18              p0g0_ agrees too
20:18 <     etank> we may be able to contact Canonical and get some extra stuff
20:19 <     etank> one O'Reilly as well for door prizes
20:19              <   ScatterBrain!n=Kevin@64.191.170.164 ["Leaving"]
20:19 <     etank> and even system76 to do the flyers
20:19 <     etank> thing is that we need to get the word out as soon as possible
20:19 < defishguy> etank:  The swag would make a good incentive for folks who drum up participants.  I would disqualify myself form the competition for it because of the kids.
20:20              p0g0_ dons the chef's hat...intermittant connection ahead.
20:20 <     etank> defishguy: we would raffle them off to people who attend
20:20 < defishguy> That is a good idea
20:20 <     etank> free event with food, g33kdom, prizes, etc
20:20 < Ubuntu-Ky> Nothing to free etank!
20:21              >>> talon315!n=bdobson@h54.187.29.71.ip.alltel.net
20:21 <     etank> shut up Ubuntu-Ky 
20:21 <     etank> bkingx: you need to start blogging
20:21 <    bkingx> Like I have anything to say.
20:21 <     etank> since you can be / are syndicated to the planet
20:21 <     etank> two of us talking it up would be better than one
20:22 <    bkingx> True.  I can do that.
20:22 <     etank> zenwhen should do it as well
20:22              bkingx nods
20:22 <      Zuph> Everyone needs to plug everything all the time everywhere.
20:22 <     etank> and i hit two planets now so that will help some too maybe
20:22 <     etank> hit the forums and wiki with it like crazy
20:22 <     etank> mailing lists too
20:23 <     etank> too bad the darn web site isn't up right now
20:23 <     etank> Where would a good place be to have the event???
20:24 <     etank> that is a huge hurdle to get over
20:24              >>> samurai8!n=pdv@h217.156.140.67.ip.alltel.net
20:24 <     etank> hi samurai8 
20:25 <  samurai8> hi
20:25 <  samurai8> you there talon?
20:25 <  talon315> yup
20:25 <  talon315> sortof
20:25 <    bkingx> I say at the school, if defishguy can get us in.
20:25 <      Zuph> etank: Someplace with a projector
20:26 <     etank> bkingx: i agree
20:26 <     etank> defishguy: what do you thing
20:26 <     etank> s/thing/think/
20:26 <     p0g0_> The school!
20:26 < defishguy> I thing that would be fine.
20:26 <     etank> :P
20:26 <     etank> sounds good
20:26 < defishguy> Sorry that was a bad joke.  I don't know what I was thinging.
20:27 <     etank> it would be good get LPLUG and UKLUG involved if they want to 
20:27 <      Zuph> Yeah
20:28 <    bkingx> Agreed
20:28 <     etank> ScatterBrain was just in here too
20:28 <    bkingx> UKLUG is basicallyt dead though/
20:28 <     etank> thats what i though
20:28 <     etank> t
20:28 <     etank> since the uber member (srwalter) left
20:28 < defishguy> So Jan 12 @ 3PM to about 6PM at the school.
20:28 <     etank> defishguy: yup
20:28 <    bkingx> yup
20:29 <     etank> is it worth it to do the packets like we did last time?
20:29 <      Zuph> etank: Yes, yes 1000x yes
20:30 <     etank> ok
20:30 <     etank> the good thing is that we have CDs this time
20:31 <     etank> we can take our time printing them too
20:31 <      Zuph> Yeah
20:31 <     etank> it would be kinda cool to have a sign up on a web site to register people
20:31 <      Zuph> Except I only have access to the sweet color laser until Dec. 14th :-p
20:31 <     etank> but then again we may not have that many people to warrant it
20:32 <     etank> oh wait
20:32 <     etank> we only need them for the packet and release forms
20:32 <     etank> the flyers hopefully we can get from system76
20:32 <     p0g0_> It might be good to toss in a couple of spicy mini-presentations- something for the non beginner too-not sure what tho...
20:33 <     etank> we should set up a wiki page to put our ideas together
20:33 <      Zuph> yesh
20:34 <     etank> anyone want to do that for us?
20:35 <     etank> is there anything that we did not do last time that we want / need to do this time?
20:35 <      Zuph> More people
20:35 <      Zuph> More Pictures.
20:35 <      Zuph> More Publicity
20:35 <      Zuph> That's about it.
20:35 <     etank> more workers??
20:36 <     etank> or people coming for help?
20:36 <     p0g0_> Win the lottory, solve Poincare's Last Theorum, Sack Rome?
20:36 <     etank> we had a ton of workers there i thought
20:36 <      Zuph> More people coming for help!
20:36 <     etank> agreed
20:37 <     etank> defishguy: how many did you have for the /. party?
20:38 <     etank> how easy can we get net access at the school defishguy 
20:38              <   talon315!n=bdobson@h54.187.29.71.ip.alltel.net ["Leaving."]
20:38 <     etank> we can try to set up a apt-cache box again to limit the connections out
20:38 <     etank> it you need us to
20:38 < defishguy> Four students.  The install fest should be a bit higher than that.  We've already installed it in class a few times, and there is still quite a bit of interest.  Internet access might be touchy.  At least unrestricted access.
20:39 <     etank> defishguy: how many total came
20:39 < defishguy> Six
20:39 <     etank> so srwalter erin and your students
20:39 < defishguy> Yeah
20:39 <     etank> k
20:40              <   samurai8!n=pdv@h217.156.140.67.ip.alltel.net []
20:40 <     etank> last time if i remember right we had about 30 in all 
20:42 <     etank> alrighty
20:42 <     etank> how about we think on it some and put ideas on the wiki
20:42 < defishguy> etank:  An apt-cache box would be a good idea.  I'll set up a user to authenticate with for our isa server and all should be good for internet access.
20:43 <     etank> i will see if i can get things going on the flyers and such
20:43 <      Zuph> Coffee shop switching to winter hours and closing earlier?!
20:43 <      Zuph> Blasphemy
20:43 <      Zuph> BRB
20:44              <   Zuph!n=Zuph@69.64.3.78 [Remote closed the connection]
20:45 <     etank> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KentuckyTeam/InstallFest2008
20:46 <     etank> fill in the detail everyone
20:46 <     etank> we need everyone to pull off a big event
20:46 <     etank> and plug it like crazy
20:46              >>> comfurtn!n=Kyle_Wri@199.76.167.24
20:46 <     etank> maybe get Lee Cruse to do a spot on it the day of the event :)
20:47 <     etank> tap tap ... is this thing on?
20:47 <    bkingx> Good idea etank
20:47 < defishguy> bkingx needs to be on camera
20:48 <    bkingx> Negative
20:48 < defishguy> wimp
20:48 < defishguy> I double dog dare ya
20:48 <     etank> i think that zuph and erin are good on camera
20:48 <     etank> and p0g0_ too
20:49 <     etank> it would be good to have some shirts made up this time
20:49 <     etank> if they are cheap
20:49 <    bkingx> yup
20:49 <     etank> maybe we can get a canonical kit
20:49              >>> Pat40503!n=patchad@74-131-211-12.dhcp.insightbb.com
20:49 <     etank> and a foresight one too :)
20:50 <     etank> for me, defishguy and Zuph
