__TOC__

I'm a 31 year old father of 4, on a crusade to fix bug #1 :)

I've "played" with Linux since the mid 90's, until one day someone handed me a Warty CD. Not long after I began dual-booting Ubuntu/Windows.. then bought a second machine... then pretty much just powered off the XP machine.

I run a Samba/LDAP domain in my home, I host my own mail and webservers, as well as internal DNS and DHCP all on Ubuntu.

Since my job happens to be fixing problems, I have a lot of opportunities to present Ubuntu to clients... and so far, they LOVE it.

My experience has been that once people see the power of open source and the ease of Ubuntu, they suddenly start wondering why they're sending so much cash to Redmond.
