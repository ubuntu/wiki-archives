=== I updated my system and it will no longer boot! ===

Unfortunately it is sometimes the case that your system will fail to boot due to changes within the kernel. It is important that when submitting bug reports about these types of failures that you include the appropriate debugging information that can help the kernel team resolve the issue.  See the DebuggingKernelBoot guide for more information.
