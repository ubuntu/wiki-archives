=== How do I find the kernel team? ===

The Kernel Team is primarily IRC based as we are located in disparate cities throughout the world.  We typically hang out on the <code>#ubuntu-kernel</code> channel on <nowiki>[[Libera.chat]]</nowiki>, please be patient if we seem to be quiet.  See the <nowiki>[[KernelTeam]]</nowiki> page for more details.
