For the best result, ensure that:

* Your computer has enough room for Kubuntu and your  data - your songs, pictures, videos, and documents.
* Your computer is connected to the Internet so that you can download updates and third-party software as Kubuntu is installing.

"Third-party software" includes software that either does not follow the Open Source model or the <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/about/about-ubuntu/our-philosophy|Ubuntu Philosophy]]</nowiki>, but is safe for use on your system.

Downloading the updates while installing will ensure that you have the latest bug and security fixes included and applied once the installation is complete.
