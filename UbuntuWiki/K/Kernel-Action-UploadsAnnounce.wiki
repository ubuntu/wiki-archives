=== Announce kernel uploads ===

A number of other groups are affected by the Ubuntu Kernel changing.  We therefore announce all kernel uploads to the kernel-team, installer group, and ARM group (note the ARM group are subscribed to kernel-team@).  An example email is included below:

<pre>
To: kernel-team <kernel-team@lists.ubuntu.com>,
        ubuntu-installer <ubuntu-installer@lists.ubuntu.com>
Subject: [Maverick] linux kernel 2.6.35-4.5 uploaded (ABI bump)

We have uploaded a new Maverick linux kernel.  This kernel primarily
reverts some evdev patches which introduced a security hole.  Please
note the ABI bump:
