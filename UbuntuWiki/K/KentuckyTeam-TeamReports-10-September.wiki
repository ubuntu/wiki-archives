__TOC__

* This month the team was up for renewal. We had 5 of our members present for the meeting. All in all it went well. The only negative against us that I saw was that we have not been doing TeamReports (hence this page :)). The result was a unanimous approval of the LoCo council members present. Thanks to all who were there.
