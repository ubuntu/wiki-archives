=== Kernel Audio ===
Reviewing the audio backlog for the main pain points.  After discussions at platform sprint and elsewhere, I will be creating / updating the relevant wiki pages with debugging information.  Also, I will be developing a HW database for the kernel team to help with troublesome HW in general.
