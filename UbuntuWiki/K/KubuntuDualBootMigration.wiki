__TOC__

The steps to Dual Booting Windows and Kubuntu, instead of Windows and Ubuntu, are identical with the exception of the step that preforms '''Migration of Documents and Settings'''. <<BR>>

That step (step 6 in the Ubuntu Installation procedure) is not part of the Kubuntu installation so instead of 7 steps to installation Startup there are only 6 steps when installing Kubuntu. One other element that is different in the Kubuntu Installation is the color scheme. The Kubuntu color scheme leans towards different shades of blue. 

So other than Migration of Documents and Settings (Ubuntu installation step 6) you should see the exact same screens, forms and prompts when installing Kubuntu as you would see when installing Ubuntu.
