=== Obtaining the kernel sources for an Ubuntu release using apt-get ===

The literal source code which generated a specific binary package may be obtained using the <code>apt-get source <package></code> command.  For example to obtain the source for the currently running kernel you can use the command below:

<pre>
apt-get source linux-image-unsigned-$(uname -r)
</pre>

or failing that:

<pre>
apt-get source linux-image-$(uname -r)
</pre>
