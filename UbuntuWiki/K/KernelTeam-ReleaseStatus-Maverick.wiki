=== Release Meeting Items ===
==== Current ====
===== Bugs =====

* LP:633983: Can't boot Maverick beta amd64 live cd on macbook (EFI)
** Have asked cking and manjo if they could take a look at this.
** From the bug commentary this is most probabally an incompatibility between the Mac EFI implementation and the CDs; amd64 images now have specific EFI support and this is reported as a problem with Win7 CDs on these machines also.  To confirm this we need to remaster the amd64 CD without EFI support.  A remastered image has now been made available and testing requested.
* LP:633392: Bridged Guests losing network connectivity
** Debug info not showing any obvious kernel errors, still investigating.
* LP:628029:panda ES1.0 does not suspend on beta image
** Suggested release note, "Due to current hardware limitations it is not possible to use suspend on the Ubuntu ARM images for pandaboards (OMAP4) even though the suspend option is shown in the logout menu."
* LP:497546: Microphones not working on Dell Vostro 320
** diwic is currently investigating but this is not likely to get resolved before 10.10.

===== Specs =====
* UbuntuSpec:kernel-maverick-apparmor (jjohansen)
** AppArmor has now officially landed upstream for the 2.6.36 kernel. \o/  This blueprint can be considered finished for the Maverick cycle.
* UbuntuSpec:kernel-maverick-config-review (ogasawara)
** All planned configuration changes have been made and the final kernel content and configuration report has been sent to ubuntu-devel.  This blueprint can be considered finished for the Maverick cycle.
* UbuntuSpec:kernel-maverick-firewire-stack (manjo)
** Kernel config options are enabled already to build both old and new stack.  Userspace bits have been uploaded as well.  Call for testing is now out to the community with no reports of any issues.  This spec should be considered finished for the Maverick cycle.
* UbuntuSpec:kernel-maverick-misc (apw)
** This is our catchall blueprint to track work items which don't warrant an individual spec but still represent a task needing attention.  Misc work items remain open but are not release critical.
* UbuntuSpec:kernel-maverick-new-kernel-on-lts (tgardner)
** The LTS backport kernel and meta packages can be found at http://ppa.launchpad.net/kernel-ppa/ppa/ubuntu and continues to track the Maverick kernel.
* UbuntuSpec:kernel-maverick-pv-ops-ec2-kernel (jjohansen)
** jjohansen The maverick -virtual kernel should now provide support as a pv-ops kernel on EC2.  This does not include the pv-on-HVM drivers which are required for Amazon's Compute Cloud.  pv-on-hvm has been postponed to M+1.  There was not going to be an AMI to support the CC in Maverick so it made no sense to push it in.  Instead we are going to roll a kernel PPA including pv-on-hvm for testing purposes.  This blueprint is now considered finished for the Maverick cycle.
* UbuntuSpec:kernel-maverick-ubuntu-delta-review (ogasawara)
** All major work items are complete.  The single remaining work item is not release critical.
* UbuntuSpec:kernel-maverick-union-mounts (apw)
** After investigation, we are staying with aufs2 for Maverick.  As a result aufs2 has been updated to the latest.  This blueprint is considered finished for the Maverick cycle. 
* UbuntuSpec:kernel-maverick-upstart (apw)
** Testing at the Maverick Rally show threw up a bug in the the readahead tracking patches.  This was resolved and a final patch has been pushed to the kernel-team mailing list, applied to the Maverick kernel and uploaded.

=== Items Pushed out from Beta ===
* Nothing release critical was pushed out.

=== Items Pushed out from Alpha-3 ===
* '''DONE''' kernel-maverick-pv-ops-ec2-kernel: Finish evaluation of which pv-on-HVM drivers to use

=== Items Pushed out from Alpha-2 ===
* '''DONE''' foundations-m-686-compile: determine whether kernel options need to change to follow this change (once documented)
** Blocking on the spec being drafted
* '''DONE''' kernel-maverick-firewire-stack: blacklist old firewire stack & enable new stack
** '''DONE''' Still awaiting additional testing/feedback before blacklisting old stack
** '''DONE''' Add basic tests to kernel-qa to test new firewire stack, issue call for testing new stack
** '''DONE''' triage and maintain a list of bugs reported on the new firewire stack.
* '''DONE''' kernel-maverick-pv-ops-ec2-kernel: Refresh Xen patchset and get xen version of EC2 kernel working in Maverick

=== Items Pushed out from Alpha-1 ===

* '''DONE''' kernel-maverick-upstart: look at passing all used and unused kernel command line options to userspace
** this still requires testing, it also makes most sense to push this into the kernel just after a milestone.  Moving to early Alpha-2.
* '''DONE''' kernel-maverick-union-mounts: push union-mount tools to PPA
* '''DONE''' kernel-maverick-union-mounts: evaluate union-mount as a replacement for AUFS
** both of these still require testing.  Moving to Alpha-2.
* kernel-maverick-new-kernels-on-lts: Investigate MIR process for this package:TODO
* kernel-maverick-new-kernels-on-lts: interlock with QA to set support levels:TODO
** both of these are long term goals and more sensible achieved before Beta-1.
* '''DONE''' desktop-maverick-xorg-in-mm: review the i8xx patch
** Work item dropper per RAOF, see comment in spec
* '''DONE''' desktop-maverick-xorg-in-mm: produce a PPA for the i8xx patch to allow testing
** there is currently much discussion over the patch and it is still evolving, waiting till the patch settles.  Work item dropper per RAOF, see comment in spec.
