==== About Me ====
I am a college student studying computer system engineering. I started using Linux in 1999 with Redhat 5.2. After many years and many distros, I still would not call myself an expert but many people I have helped may tell you differently. I now use Ubuntu Linux on my laptop and Gentoo Linux on my desktop. I still have a Windows machine around, but it is mostly for gamming and software because some engineering programs do not run well via WINE. In all my experiance I have to say that Ubuntu is the best distrubution that I have ever used, and I highly recommend it.
