THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS

This page reviews performance tunning options and methods for running KVM as a virtualization platform in Ubuntu Server.

""Frequency Scaling:""

""Scheduler:""

The default setting of Ubuntu server will use the CFQ scheduler which tries to ideally balance between background and user related tasks.
For a virtualization platfrom, considering we are running little to no services on the KVM host, we recommend using the deadline scheduler.
The goal of the Deadline scheduler is to attempt to guarantee a start service time for a request. It does that by imposing a deadline on all I/O operations to prevent resource starvation.

Edit /etc/default/grub, and change 

 GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash" 

to 

 GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="elevator=deadline quiet splash"

""Enabling VT-d:""

VT-d is a technology developed by Intel that complement the existing VT technology by allowing for optimization of I/O resources in Virtualization environments.
