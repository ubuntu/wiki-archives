Inspired by a <nowiki>[[http://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2005-April/006834.html|posting]]</nowiki> on ubuntu-devel, here's a list of things it would be nice to have in a possible future Desktop Configuration Wizard for Kubuntu.

Please add your own suggestions (hopefully, you also think such a "First Run Wizard" would be a cool thing to have).

* Enable use of multiverse/universe and other repos
** Installation of extra packages
*** Windows audio/video codecs
*** Macromedia Flash
*** Sun Java
*** Official nvidia drivers

* Configuration
** KMail (name, mail address, SMTP/IMAP/POP account settings)
** Konqueror (import bookmarks from an old bookmarks.xml)
** Konqueror (block pop ups (Open new windows = "Smart"))

It would be nice to have have the ability to configure different network profiles for laptops (home, work, wifi...).

Re: KMail & Konq: Auto import of OE & IE configurations, mailboxes and bookmarks in dual-boot machines. Also, msttcorefonts, softmodem drivers (howto download them if they're not included in the CD?:) firefox, some cool packages offered individually (with their description) or grouped as interest areas such as audacity, kino/cinepaint/cinerella (avail?), nvu (avail?), gimp, scribus, kdeedu, etc... (I wonder why many of them are not installed by default, in the first place) Also it may be worthwhile to consider borrowing ideas from UserTemplates wiki page.
