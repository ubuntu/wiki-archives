== Biography ==
Ever since I can remember, I have always been a lover of technology. As a young kid, I would always be found taking my toys apart only to put them back together later (mostly). This trait has carried over into except for much larger and expensive toys. I currently work as a Senior Level Software Engineer during the day and a tech blogger. 

I am a huge fan of Tacos, Open Source Technology and Everything Google Related (Android, Chrome, Google Glass, etc). My love with Android began when I purchased my first Android Smartphone, the HTC EVO 4G on Sprint and found out that it can be customized with custom ROMs, Launchers and Tweaks. I am active in the South Florida Ubuntu User Group, Florida Glass Explorer Groups and I am very active with several Florida Hackerspaces, Makerspaces and Innovation Centers.

Aside from Android, I am a Open Source Software junkie who chooses to spend most of my time using and tinkering with several Linux Distributions.  I have been using Ubuntu with the Gnome Shell for the past several years as my daily driver. I am currently on Ubuntu 14.10 (64 bit). I am an active member of the Florida Ubuntu LoCo Group. 
 

My current list of devices that I carry on a daily basis include; The Sony Z Ultra GPE, 2013 Nexus 7 LTE, Nexus 10, Kindle Fire HDX, Kindle Fire Paperwhite, Dell Venue Pro 8, Google Glass, HP Chromebook 11 and a Asus TF300La and a System 76 Laptop running Ubuntu Gnome. Needless to say, I am also a fan of oversized backpacks.

Furthermore, I am very active in the Web Hosting Industry where I have done extensive work with several reputable brands. I have held several positions from technical consultant to senior management.
