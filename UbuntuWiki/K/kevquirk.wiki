=== About Me ===

I’m an IT professional with a passion for web design, open source technologies and basically all things geeky. I currently work for Hewlett Packard as part of a 24×7 shift team that specialise in enterprise level security services. My particular specialisation within the team is Microsoft technologies, email & networking.

In my spare time I run my technology blog RefuGeeks. It has become very successful and is growing fast. RefuGeeks, is currently seeing around 30,000 – 40,000 hits per month. I am also a contributing author to the Ubuntu Manual Project and OMG! Ubuntu!. Finally, I contribute to the PinguyOS forums as a moderator and I also designed and maintain their website.

When I’m not working with computers I enjoy keeping fit by cycling, running and going to the gym. I also enjoy nothing more than kicking back with a cold beer and my acoustic guitar.

=== Contributions to the Ubuntu Community ===

     {*} I've been an active member of the Ubuntu Forums since July 2010.

     {*} I'm a contributing author to the Ubuntu Manual project for the 12.04 release.

     {*} Regular contributing author to the very popular OMG! Ubuntu! blog.

     {*} I regularly blog about Linux and Open Source helping other users where possible.

     {*} I'm a forum moderator on the PinguyOS forums.

     {*} I designed and actively maintain the PinguyOS website.

     {*} Last but not least, I own an Ubuntu mug!!!

=== Future Goals ===

This year I have taught myself CSS in order to start maintaining my own website. Next year my plans are to learn how to code and hopefully start helping out with bux fixing with a view to getting into development. It would be awesome to help out with the nuts and bolts that make this community as awesome as it is.

I also have some plans to further develop pushing open source and Ubuntu via my website but I don't want to elaborate on those plans just yet. ;-)
