| Knows his <insert colourful expression>. If I would be a sponsor of Kamal, I would have full trust in him. But I rather do ask him for packaging advice.

| Kamal is a skilled and respected member of the kernel team. As a Debian developer he has uploaded hundreds of packages. He is currently a stable kernel maintainer for Canonical. As such, I have the utmost confidence in granting Kamal upload rights.

| I have personally, reiviewd and signed several packages prepared by Kamal. I feel that Kamals' work is outstanding and I'm very comfortable with Kamal having per-package upload rights for the kernel and related packages.

|-
| Not only is Kamal an upstream stable kernel maintainer and Debian developer, he's also our team's resident packaging wizard. We continually seek his guidance, feedback, and insight for any packaging and kernel related questions. It's laughable that he doesn't have upload rights for our Ubuntu kernels already. He most certainly has the proficiency and knowledge to upload our Ubuntu kernels. I fully trust Kamal will be responsible, judicious, and take extreme care and caution when uploading our Ubuntu kernels.

|-
| I'm familiar with Kamal's work in the development arena, and am very glad to see the same attention to detail and rich investigation brought to bug triage. [Kamal's] handling of many of these bugs demonstrates a care often missed: rather than looking for a quick fix, the state of the packages have been investigated upstream and in Debian, and when bugs are discovered to be fixed, detailed information about when and how they were fixed has been indicated. I unreservedly endorse [Kamal's application to ubuntu-bugcontrol]. <nowiki>[[EmmetHikory|Emmet Hikory]]</nowiki>
