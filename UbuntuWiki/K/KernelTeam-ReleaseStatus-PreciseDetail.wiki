| How can we get better at celebrating contributions to Ubuntu development? There is massive amounts of great work going into Ubuntu, some of this is under the radar because it is less visible. Celebrating this more publicly would be both inspiring for those who did the good work, and others who didn't know about the great work before.

| General session to discuss how and when new X.org bits will be integrated into Precise, and requirements from stakeholders.  Starting with this LTS, we will be doing official X stack and/or driver backports going forward.  We can work out some plans to coordinate this effort.  Since this is an LTS, and since we can do post-release upgrades, we will likely want to be very conservative in selecting versions for specific packages.  We anticipate spending most of our time during P on multi-monitor support and hybrid graphics (both covered separately), but if you have ideas for additional things to include in the X planning, please come and share your thoughts.

| It's expected this cycle that Multiarch will provide superior 32-bit compatibility for any packages that previously required ia32-libs, as well as a scalable way to add compatibility for other libraries going forward, removing one of the main pain points for running 64-bit by default.  Adobe has just released a supported 64-bit version of flashplugin, removing one of the main causes for users to need 32-bit compatibility on Linux anyway.  At the same time, the availability of UEFI only on our 64-bit images gives another compelling argument for running 64-bit instead of 32-bit, offering features like a fast UEFI boot instead of a slow BIOS POST and possibly secure boot capabilities (or possibly, the need to use UEFI to be bootable at all on certain secureboot-enabled hardware).  Should we switch to promoting 64-bit ISOs by default for 12.04 (on the website, in pressings, etc)?  What other blockers remain?

Things to discuss at least include:  - New ifupdown supporting dhcpv6  - Testing our most important server and client packages for IPv6 support  - Status of IPv6 support for Ubuntu core services like archive.ubuntu.com, archive.canonical.com, ntp.ubuntu.com, geoip.ubuntu.com, ... so we can have a perfectly working install in an IPv6 only environment  - Privacy extensions  - Dual-stack DHCP server support

This kernel will be built and maintained by the Ubuntu Studio team, therefore it presumably would be in the universe repository.

| The FreeIPA team (https://launchpad.net/~freeipa) has been working with the goal to get the packages included in Debian and Ubuntu. Running an instance of FreeIPA provides an easy to maintain kerberos realm for users and machines, 'AD for Linux'. This is something that has been requested by administrators for years, so it's about time to provide it in Ubuntu as well, even if just as a technology preview and not something fully supported (=in universe).  an earlier report on getting the IPA client work on oneiric: https://www.redhat.com/archives/freeipa-devel/2011-September/msg00408.html

| Even when user namespaces are fully implemented, there remains the concern that containers share an OS with the host, and may be able to exploit syscall vulnerabilities (in particular) to gain access to and privilege in the host.  Historically, relatively new syscalls in particular, have ended up with vulnerabilities which a container would be able to exploit.  It would be nice if we could deny a container from using certain system calls, perhaps by a method analogous to seccomp.  http://lwn.net/Articles/332438/ described plans for such, and a suggestion to combine seccomp with ftrace instead.  http://code.google.com/p/seccompsandbox/ describes what google ended up using for chrome on linux instead.  http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/capsicum/ describes the approach used on freebsd.  http://git.chromium.org/gitweb/?p=kernel-capsicum.git;a=summary is a port to linux.  These are very useful for sandboxes in general, but not ideal for this lxc concern.  This blueprint, then, is for following, helping and testing, or initiating the seccomp+ftrace approach.

| The System Security Services Daemon (SSSD) is a service which provides access to different identity and authentication providers. You can configure SSSD to use a native LDAP domain (that is, an LDAP identity provider with LDAP authentication), or an LDAP identity provider with Kerberos authentication. It provides an NSS and PAM interface to the system, and a pluggable back-end system to connect to multiple different account sources. SSSD is also extensible; you can configure it to use new identity sources and authentication mechanisms should they arise. In addition, SSSD is fully IPv6-compatible.  Canonical's support services would like this package moved from Universe to Main in response to needs expressed by Ubuntu Server users.

| Ensure that a base set of packages is cross-compilable from an x86 host to an ARM target. The goal is to ensure the packaging of packages in Ubuntu Core, Ubuntu Server, and a base set of desktop system libraries/applications (qt, gtk, glib, freetype, firefox) supports cross-compilation of those packages..

| currently every ubuntu install requires an initrd, this is caused by the fact that we: a) use UUID for finding the rootfs b) some packages have a requirement to process bits before the rootfs is mounted  this spec is supposed to span across multiple releases, we first need make the kernel recognize UUIDs for partitions and second there needs to be something like a database that knows when a package is installed that needs an initrd.  This spec is considered implemented if initrds are only generated once a package is installed that require them or the user explicitly choose to use an initrd.
