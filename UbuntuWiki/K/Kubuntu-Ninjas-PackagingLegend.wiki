This is a Quick Guide as to what the timeline is for a Ninja Packager

For any packaging that is being executed by a ninja there are certain states it must pass through. They are in order

* In Progress

* PPA

* BZR

* Reviewed

* Uploaded

Packages may also be in the state FTBFS and Dep-Wait

=== In Progress ===

The Source code has been pulled and is being prepared for compilation and packaging

=== PPA ===

The prepared source code has been uploaded and is currently being packaged

=== BZR ===

The Prepared source code is in Bazaar for public perusal and review

=== Reviewed ===

The Packages have been looked over and are good for naming conventions, conflicts and can be installed and run

=== Uploaded ===

The packages have been sponsored by a Kubuntu Developer and are available for public use.

=== Other States ===

Other states which may be possible are FTBFS or Dep-Wait

==== FTBFS ====

Failed to Build From Source: Something is wrong either with the source code, the compiler and accompanying instructions or the ninja's elite kit of tools (commonly called a computer by non ninjas) This is a general call for the clan to rally and assist with knowledge, tips, code patches or cold hard silicon like steel to assist in the accomplishment of this mission. 

==== Dep-Wait ====

The Dependency wait is when either a package requires another package before it can be built or it requires another package before it can be installed and tested. This is a call to have someone attack the dependency on behalf of the dependent or for the ninja currently assigned that task to hurry up and execute. (Silently and efficiently of course)
