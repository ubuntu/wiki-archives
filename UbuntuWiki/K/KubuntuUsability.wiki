=== BoF agenda and discussion ===

Sit down with Ellen and work out stuff we can improve:

Pragmatic issues, e.g.:

* Review first-time setup (sound, network, printer ... == control center).
* Review adept (including resources).
* Checking defaults of key applications.

But also "softer" issues, e.g.:

* Who should our users be - compared to Ubuntu, Edubuntu, Xubuntu..?
* What tasks do they accomplish with Kubuntu? How can we best support them? How can we make their life easier? ->> Interface to community for surveys, usability tests, interviews etc.
* How can we intersect with KDE in this regard? How can KDE and Kubuntu benefit from each other?
