=== Goal and Intent ===
The Kernel Team, in cooperation with the Kernel Bug Supervisors, have concluded that the growth of the kernel bug triage community is a priority and should, therefore, have a venue for knowledge growth. This will be achieved by creating regularly occurring events in the same spirit as the Ubuntu User Days and the Ubuntu Developer Week. We anticipate that the manner in which we provide this benefit to our community will be flexible and ever-changing as we review the utility and impact of these events. 

The initial event will be based in IRC with a review and plan for the next Summit in the next cycle.
