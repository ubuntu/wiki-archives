==== A little about me ====
My name is Kuroshi (not really, but I tend to avoid posting my real name, if you dig a bit you can find it.), and I'm basically a linux geek. My hobbies include playing around in various programming and scripting languages, messing with robots, and idling on IRC. I am originally from Indiana, and am currently a student at Purdue University. I'm not incredibly active (or even an official member) of the local LUG here, but I am a member of the NightTrain swing dancing club (<nowiki>[[http://www.swingpurdue.org]]</nowiki>) and of the FIRST robotics organization (<nowiki>[[http://www.purduefirst.org]]</nowiki>).

==== Interest in Linux (warning-a history) ====
Back as a freshman of high school I joined <nowiki>[[http://www.teamroboto.org|Team Roboto #447]]</nowiki> as a programmer. I learned a lot, but the person teaching me told me about this thing called "linux". I said, well, I'll give it a shot, partition my hard drive, and installed Fedora Core 3. Back than, wireless didn't exist for linux yet, so I wasn't able to play too much with it other than the default install. I played with fedora until I noticed the majority of my google searches for help turned up with "ubuntuforums". So, I went to ubuntu.org, installed dapper drake, had a lot of problems with it (and had some words on the forums, which I realize now was a stupid thing and can't apologize enough), but got it working around the time edgy came out. Now I run intrepid and am very excited for jaunty, coming up in less than a month (don't expect this to get updated when it does, though, I'll have forgotten about it by them ^_^)

==== Spreading the wealth ====
Well, my interest in joining the linux community and spreading the wonders of linux didn't start until recently, so I haven't done much other than try to convince my friends to try it and/or use it. Mostly unsuccessfully. I'll be giving a speech on linux next week, though, and hopefully be promoting it much more than I am now.

==== Contact ====

I'm always available on the PLUG and IndianaTeam Mailing List, also usually idling around on #ubuntu, #cinlug, and #ubuntu-us-in on irc.freenode.net, you can also contact me with:
