=== Changes to fix ABI/API breakage across lum/lbm and kernel source ===

* Kernel patch: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/57332/
* lum should Build-Conflicts with lbm headers
* lum and lbm should provide headers in /lib/modules/`uname -r`/ubuntu-headers-{lbm,lum}
* headers package are flavour specific
* Need meta packages for these headers
* v4l drivers that require alsa should be copied to lum
* CONFIG_SND should be disabled in kernel
* Use missing module list to cross check modules that need to be moved to lum

=== Implementation Notes ===

* The headers packages are actually installed in /usr/src/linux-headers-lum-PKGVER-ABINUM-FLAVOUR which is consistent with kernel headers.
