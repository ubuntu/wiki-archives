=== About me ===
My name is Krunoslav Husak. I'm a 26 years old student at Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing in Zagreb, Croatia. I’m computer enthusiast, web programmer, amateur radio operator, amateur photographer... I'm using computers since I was 6-7 years old. First there was Sinclair Spectrum mostly used for playing games. Now I'm using my PC for web design & programming as well as programming desktop applications. Currently I'm working on learning management system used in high schools based on PHP/MySQL.
