=== About Me ===
Hi, my name's Kristopher Maguire, 22 years old and was born and reside in the UK.

I'm the Team Leader of <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lubuntu/CommunicationsTeam]]</nowiki>. The team deals with the Facebook, Twitter, G+, FB groups and various other social accounts officially associated with Lubuntu. 

Whilst this is my first Wiki and first real position with the Ubuntu/Lubuntu team I have been a Linux user for many years and am experienced in web hosting, web design, social media marketing, web marketing, SEO, advertising and lots more - hence why I was picked to do what I do.
