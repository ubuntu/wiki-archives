=== How do we choose which Flavours are supported in a release? ===

At the Ubuntu Developer Summit (UDS) we will discuss the current flavours and their applicability.  During this discussions we will make recommendations for additions to or removals from the supported flavours.  Those recommendations feed into the development for that upcoming release.
