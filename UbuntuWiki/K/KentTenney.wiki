AFAICT this is where blogs live on Launchpad.

A few older posts are on Blogspot http://gumpablog.blogspot.com/, there is more about ME at https://launchpad.net/~ktenney

Here's my first attempt at implementing some of the stuff I've written
about on Blogspot, 'words in space', and attempting to correlate cognitive
and spatial relationships.

It attempts to describe a minimal Inkscape extension in Python, 
and the steps to debug using winpdb.

To relieve me of the delusion that this is original work, I recently
found this example of of the principles involved: 
http://panela.blog-city.com/more_beginner_python_cheatsheets.htm

It's crowded, hard to read, brittle and awkward to maintain, but
I find it useful as a cheatsheet, and interesting enough to keep me
working on refining tools to build such things.

As I learn a bit about using Inkscape, and build some simple extensions,
I expect the process to become quite tolerable.

This is dogfood, I've been planning to look at Grok next, incorporating
the browser into the toolchain.
