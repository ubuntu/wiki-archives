=== Objective ===

This team's main objective is to make new members of the Kentucky LoCo team feel welcome, and to help them in accessing any and all of the team's resources. We will work to assist new members with technical questions, or point them to a resource that can help them.

=== Resources ===

When a new member presents themself, either through the forums, through the mailing list, or through the IRC channels, we need to present them with all of our available resources, to help them feel welcome and comfortable. As such, here are the resources available to Kentucky LoCo members (taken from etank's post on the forums):
