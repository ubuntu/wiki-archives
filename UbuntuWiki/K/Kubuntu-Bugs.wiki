__TOC__



== Introduction ==
Kubuntu uses the <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/|Launchpad bug tracker]]</nowiki> to keep track of problems found with the operating system and desktop environment.  Users should file all bugs that they find in Kubuntu in the bug tracker.  It is used to keep track of outstanding issues, issues that are being worked on, and fixes.

== Reporting Bugs ==
See <nowiki>[[/Reporting|here]]</nowiki> for more information on how to file bugs in KDE, Kubuntu's desktop and applications.

== Helping with Bugs ==
A lot of bugs come in and help is needed to sort through them all, ensure they have all the needed information, confirm them, and decide on an importance.  This process is called triaging.  See <nowiki>[[HelpingWithBugs|information on how to help out]]</nowiki> and see <nowiki>[[DebuggingKDE|here]]</nowiki> for related information specific to KDE.
