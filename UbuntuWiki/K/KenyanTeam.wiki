=== Welcome ===

This is the wiki page of the Kenya Local Community Team. We aim to provide free community support to users of the various flavours of Ubuntu Linux as well as advocating the use of Ubuntu by schools, individuals and organisations alike.

=== Who is this group for? ===

This group is for anyone in Kenya who uses or is interested in some flavour of Ubuntu, whether it's Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Xubuntu or any others. This group is for people of all technical abilities from I've-never-heard-of-linux all the way to I'm-an-Ubuntu-Master.

=== Aims ===

* To provide consultancy and tutor services to new users
* To distributing Ubuntu CDs to businesses, schools, institutions, organizations and individuals.
* To develop an Ubuntu identity
* To develop a local community developer.
* To advocate free and open source solutions (FOSS) as alternatives where they exist.

=== Meetings ===

Our national meetings are usually held on-line via IRC (channel:#ubuntu-ke) where you are most likely to find either (zsh) or (mzungu). Regular face-to-face meetings are planned, however, as yet, only the Nairobi Team hold regular meetings. Please see the Nairobi Team page for more details, or contact RonaldOdero. 
We were also one of the participants at the <nowiki>[[KenyanTeam/SFD2007| Software Freedom Day]]</nowiki> event held at KICC.

Are you stuck with something? Can't find the answer? Just send an email to the mailing list, or join us in our IRC channel and we'll do our best to help out. If your problem needs to be solved in person, a volunteer will gladly offer to help. Alternatively, if you want to talk to a wider audience about Ubuntu, Linux and Kenya - feel free to post at 
<nowiki>[[http://ke.ubuntuforums.org|our forum]]</nowiki>.

=== How You Can Help Ubuntu-ke ===

By joining the team! Merely joining and participating would be help enough. <<BR>><<BR>>If you fancy pitching in, there are a number of projects under way that could use help. RonaldOdero has been helping a couple of NGOs to equip rural schools with computers. The aim is to furnish these computers with the Edubuntu operating system and software suite. If you have any old PC hardware lying around the home or office, please contact RonaldOdero. If you have any projects that fit in with our aims, and you'd like us to implement them, please let us know and we'll gladly help.
