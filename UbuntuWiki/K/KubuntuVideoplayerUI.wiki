=== Summary ===

The KMPlayer author wants a new user interface design, this is what we'd like to see.

=== Rationale ===

Kaffeine has a nice UI but the plugin crashes.  KMPlayer has a poor user interface.  The KMPlayer author wants to remake KMPlayer as Oskar and would like a new user interface.  This would benefit us as we only have to ship with 1 video player.
