=== Summary ===

Ensure the health of the Kubuntu community.

=== Implementation ===

==== Council ====

Yuriy and Tonio will stand down. RichardJohnson has already done so.  We will ask for names for the council at the next Kubuntu meeting and get the community council to vote on it.

==== Forums ====

We discussed the forums.  We are happy to have multiple forums for Kubuntu, and we're happy that the kubuntuforums.net maintainer has not fallen off the internet entirely.

==== Tutorials Day ====

We will run another tutorials day.  <nowiki>[[KubuntuTutorialsDay-Prep]]</nowiki>
