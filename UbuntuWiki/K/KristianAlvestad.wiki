__TOC__

I'm a Student of Information Technology at the University College of Bergen. 

My programming skills are currently very limited, but I do have some experience with C, C++, QT, Bash-scripting and Java. Additionaly I am working on my LPI certification (got to set a date for finishing this one soon). 

I've been an exclusive Linux user since 2001, about a year after I discovered Linux. The first contact I had with Linux was when I purchased a RedHat 7 Bible. Suddently I had this great system that I had no clue of how to use, suddently computers were way much more than a poor games console. As I said, I started out using RedHat, then moved to Mandriva for several years, switched to SuSE in 2004, and now all my three computers are running Ubuntu as their main OS.
