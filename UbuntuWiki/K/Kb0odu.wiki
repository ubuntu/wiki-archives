__TOC__

I am a Database Administrator working for a financial institution in Portland, OR and support a variety of web sites for friends and family out of my house using Debian, Ubuntu, Freesco and SuSE Linux.

You can reach me through my <nowiki>[[http://www.tbruce.com|website]]</nowiki> or e-mailing tim through any of my domains.

The name KB0ODU refers to my amateur radio callsign, so I sign a lot of email with it and use it on a lot of websites.  If you find a site where someone is impersonating me, please contact me.  Thank you.

Tim
