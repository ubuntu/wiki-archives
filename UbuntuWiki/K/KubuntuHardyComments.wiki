What do you think of Kubuntu 8.04 (Hardy Heron)? Keep comments brief, we usually can not respond to comments because there are so many but we do read every one.

* This bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/221329 makes it impossible to make any constructive comments - as I can't even boot from the live CD. Surely these sort of issues should have been resolved before release.
* Just curious, was it a goal in Ubuntu 8.04 to make my system completely unusable with an issue known since beginning of april?  https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/188226 (fix is not in release)  - tom
* Adept Manager's "Version upgrade" wizard crashed on the first or second page, first time I ran it. The second time it worked. --gandy
* I still cannot control the sound volume on my Thinkpad T61p. --gandy
* Resuming after suspending to RAM on my Thinkpad T61p used to work with Gutsy, but upgrading to Hardy broke it. (Some changes were necessary in a bunch of config files.) Resuming after hibernating never worked. --gandy
* Synergy is unusable due to kernel shedueler changes: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/188226 --gandy
* My desktop (KDE3) looks sharper than before --gandy
* Battery management is awesome (with power consumption). Plus now the brightness adjustment keys work (Fn+F6 key combination). i've noticed some performance improvements as well, which is rather impressive! On the down side ... well the printer system isn't working on one computer and on both systems so far firefox3 has been performing very sluggishly, including crashes, hangs, slow rendering, ... but ok. Upgrading was a breeze though in general - CONGRATULATIONS and THANK YOU! now that the upgrade wizard works flawlessly how about "pimping it up" a bit? (artistically) . If you like I could help :-) -- ANDREA
* ...
* I just want to thank all developers for kubuntu hardy heron. You did a great job and I'm greatly appreciate your hard work: <nowiki>[[http://www.seqfault.de/files/hardy-thankyou.png|www.seqfault.de/files/hardy-thankyou.png]]</nowiki> --Thomas
* Thanks for all your work.  I've got a pretty serious regression -- kernel panics with my Zydas USB wifi device -- https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/220013.  LukePlant
* Just as a sidenote: product placement is somewhat sub-optimal: While the RC (release candidate) takes up a lot of space on the kubuntu.org page, the final release is really small ... also, why doesn't the gtk integration work anymore? -- ANDREA (yet again)
* I upgraded a Thinkpad T41 from a fairly unmodified Gutsy yesterday. My impressions so far:

 Positive
** The upgrade over internet worked quick and flawlessly. 
** Lots of small improvements and bugfixes. 
** KDE 3.5.9 seems to start up considerably faster than 3.5.8
 Negative
** HD spindown time still set much too aggressive. Fix: Giving laptop mode control over the HD power management, providing more conservative values in /etc/laptop-mode/laptop-mode.conf.
** Still no (GUI) way to turn off Nautilus warnings when deleting files.
** KDE splash screen was set to none because the moodin package was missing
** Customizing the KDE paths via kcontrol fails because the relevant settings have moved from ~/.kde/share/config/kdeglobals to ~/.config, but the kcontrol is not aware of that
 In my opinion Hardy is a definitive improvement over Gutsy, which was already very good. Thanks to everyone involved! -- Andreas

* I have been waiting for months to try out KDE4 with Hardy Heron and frankly I'm disappointed. First of all, the KDE4 theme looks ugly but I guess Kubuntu guys can't do much about that. The biggest problem I faced within 5 min was to configure my network. My ISP requires me to configure my network to a certain IP address and gateway, etc. and when I try to right click on KNetworkManager -> Manual Configuration, it never opens up! I finally discovered that the problem was this: "kcmshell (kdelibs): WARNING: Could not find module 'kcm_knetworkconfmodule'." This was a dealbreaker for me. I'm finally up on a different temporary connection that uses DHCP. Getting back to the ugly theme, I didn't find Adept easy to understand compared to the Update Manager in Gnome/Ubuntu. Sorry, I really wish I couldn't be negative about this. Perhaps I should've chosen the KDE3 version of Kubuntu 8.04. -- Swaroop
*** Swaroop, KDE4 is not really ready for use yet, it's more of a beta version. KDE4.1 will be the first version that should be ready for we normal users. You'd be a lot better off sticking with KDE3 for the time being -- Tony
* Also, Start -> Leave -> Shutdown brings up a dialog box which *again* asks me whether I want to log out, shutdown or restart! -- Swaroop
** To remove the dialog box, open System Settings, click on 'Advanced' tab, click on 'Session Manager' and change the first option: 'Confirm logout' (an italian howto with screenshots: http://www.nonsologuide.altervista.org/guide/linux/end_session_kde4.php ).

* There's a serious problem with kded using huge amounts of CPU when any external storage devices are auto-mounted by HAL (https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/194474). This has been reported by a lot of people.

* Dialog to change password through System Settings in the KDE4 version is missing from default install.
* Machine: Inspiron 9300 with nVidia 6800 Go GPU -- Upgrade broke 'the GUI' and the nvidia module would not load.  Solution was to install envyng (*-core, *-qt) and run 'sudo envyng -uninstall-all'.  This automagically configured the system for using the stock xorg nv driver.  Just to see if it would work, I decided to go the restricted driver route instead of using envyng to install the latest nvidia driver and it works great.  On a separate note of interest, my ipw2200 firmware is no longer classified as restricted apparently.  (but is working great; change in licensing?) -- sevenseeker

* There's still no way to have a verbose boot by pressing Space/Tab/.. key ; thus you sometime get a black screen for 15s when a fsck is about to run. When starting KDE session, you don't get any progress bar ; you wait without knowing what's happening. When logging out, nothing happens for a few seconds and you can still use the KDE menu, then it finally goes... Trying the suspend mode sleeps the computer, but don't dream of gettting it to wake up (it just freezes). Well... Maybe 1 or 2 months will be necessary to get something stable.

* One suggestion, to create a mailing list for kubuntu news and include the link in kubuntu announcements page. --besembel

* Coming from experience:
      - the best video plug-in for firefox is totem (altough is gnome). Plays almost anything. Others like mplayer makes firefox crash from time to time
      
      - Tasty KMenu is a nice replacement for the default KDE Menu
      
      - compiz fusion icon package is very useful to switch between compiz and kwin
