<pre>
20:01 <     etank> is everyone ready to get the meeting going?
20:01 <   jkeyes0> always
20:01 <     etank> kool
20:01 <  pat40503> I'm new but here
20:01 <     etank> 1) Lets get this thing going again.
20:01 <   jkeyes0> welcome, pat!
20:02 <  pat40503> thanks jkeyes
20:02 <     etank> now that school is starting back
20:02 <     etank> vacations should be calming down some
20:02 <     etank> i am hoping that once UK is back in session that we will be able to start working with the UKLUG again
20:03 <     etank> maybe (hopfully) for an install fest
20:03 <     etank> when we started the team there was a lot of enthusiam
20:03 <   jkeyes0> and a release party, when 7.10 rolls around. :)
20:03 <     etank> what can we do to get that feeling back again?
20:03 <     etank> jkeyes0: exactly
20:04 <     etank> we need to do that and the install fest at seperate times
20:04 <     etank> last time we underestimated the amount of time that it would take
20:05 <   jkeyes0> I really like Zuph's idea about occasional meetings at coffeeshops, the location is the only problem for me (and a lot of people, I'd assume). I could do louisville or lexington, just not very often.
20:05 <     etank> what about once a month
20:05 <     etank> with the location changing each month
20:05 <     etank> once in lex and then next in lou
20:05 <     etank> and so forth
20:06 <     etank> and i have a friend that is a teacher at a school here in lexingtong
20:06 <   jkeyes0> I'm sure I could work something like that out. Could always showcase new games/programs we find during those as well, and new desktop themes/layouts
20:06 <     etank> *lexington
20:06 <     etank> he said that he got permission to allow us to meet there for IRL meets once a month or so
20:06 <  montgoej> that sounds good
20:07 <     etank> i would kind of like to get the feeling of this being a big LUG
20:07 <     etank> where we can learn from each other and stuff
20:08 <   jkeyes0> that's a great thought, etank 
20:08 <     etank> is there a "but" with that?
20:08 <     etank> :)
20:08 <   jkeyes0> nope. great thought, all around. 
20:08 <     etank> cool
20:09 <     etank> we also need to get together and work on the Charity PCs
20:09 <     etank> bkingx's wife is ready to kill him :)
20:09 <     etank> he has about 30 machines in his basement
20:10 <    bkingx> yup!!
20:10 <      p0g0> and Liebert in the bedroom...
20:10              <   zenwhen!n=zenwhen@ubuntu/member/zenwhen ["This computer has gone to sleep"]
20:10 <   jkeyes0> lieberts are great, and horrible.
20:10 <    bkingx> And she is HOT!!
20:11 <    bkingx> haha...just like a woman, jkeyes0 !!
20:11 <     etank> bkingx: if nothing else we should just set a date to work on those boxes
20:11 <   jkeyes0> giggity
20:11              jkeyes0 +1
20:11              >>> zenwhen!n=zenwhen@ubuntu/member/zenwhen
20:11 <     etank> and whoever shows up then that is great
20:12 <   jkeyes0> I'm glad to help out, as long as it's not a tuesday. Any evening after work is good, and some weekends.
20:12 <     etank> bkingx: it is your house 
20:12 <    bkingx> 8/25?
20:12 <     etank> why dont you set a date and time
20:12 <     etank> and then we can see how it goes
20:12 <    bkingx> say 2:00?
20:13 <     etank> is that a Saturday
20:13 <    bkingx> yeah
20:13 <   jkeyes0> sadly, I cannot make that date (best friend is getting married in gatlinburg, tn), but if you can get enough others to volunteer, go for it.
20:13              <   Vorian!n=Steve@ubuntu/member/Vorian [Connection timed out]
20:13 <    bkingx> work for a few hours and watch a movie?
20:14 <     etank> do you have the space to set a bunch of boxes up?
20:14 <   jkeyes0> is there anyone here who is unfamiliar with what the Charity PC's project is all about?
20:14 <     etank> Zuph: we need to do the same for your bunch of PCs too
20:14 <   jkeyes0> brb
20:14 <    bkingx> yeah...we can use the basement
20:15 <     etank> bkingx: can we set up some tables in the middle of the room to work around?
20:15 <    bkingx> We really need to inventory, test and clean.  Then figure what we have from there.
20:15 <    bkingx> Sure
20:15 <     etank> your couch looks kind of heavy :(
20:15 <     etank> true
20:15              <   zenwhen!n=zenwhen@ubuntu/member/zenwhen [Client Quit]
20:15 <    bkingx> I have a pretty decent 6' table.
20:15 <     etank> the first time we meet may not even involve installing an OS at all
20:16 <    bkingx> right
20:16 <     etank> who all can make it that day?
20:16              etank +1 (i think)
20:17 <    bkingx> Well, how about this saturday?  Kinda short notice, but we are free?
20:17 <   jkeyes0> :( out of town this saturday as well. :( the 11th is good, though.
20:17 <     etank> lets try for the 11th then
20:17 <    bkingx> ok
20:17 <     etank> if that is good for you bkingx 
20:17 <     etank> then 2 weeks later we do some more
20:17 <    bkingx> yup
20:18 <     etank> mind if i bring the kids ?
20:18 <     etank> and wife of course
20:18 <    bkingx> nope!
20:18 <     etank> cool
20:18 <    bkingx> OK, so the 11th at 2:00
20:18 <     etank> that sounds good
20:19 <    bkingx> We'll test, clean, inventory, suss out the junk, and then watch a movie?
20:19 <    bkingx> Maybe pitch in for some pizza's?
20:19 <   jkeyes0> mmm, pizza, movie, computers, mmm.
20:19 <     etank> what about coffee?
20:19 <     etank> mmmm
20:19 <  montgoej> I should be able to be there
20:19 <  montgoej> sorry, I walked away
20:19 <    bkingx> and coffee!!!!!
20:19 <     etank> montgoej: cool
20:20 <     etank> X626: could you make it too?
20:20 <      X626> I'm not sure.
20:20 <      X626> I'll try to make it, though.
20:20 <     etank> i think that Zuph is AFK :(
20:20 <    bkingx> nivek: ?
20:20 <  montgoej> I'm not sure if I'll be able to get the monitors on the 11th or not
20:20 <     etank> montgoej: no prob
20:20 <    bkingx> Don't worry about it montgoej 
20:20 <     etank> bkingx: has quite a few 
20:21 <    bkingx> Yup
20:21 <    bkingx> About 20 right now?
20:21 <  montgoej> they're packed into a storage building, but I'll get them soon
20:21 <     etank> kool
20:21 <    bkingx> Something like that
20:21 <     etank> 2) Cup of Ubuntu (Louisville and Lexington)
20:21 <     etank> we kind of already talked about it
20:21 <     etank> but when would be good to have a coffee time?
20:21 < Ubuntu-Ky> I guess time is starting to get short for some planning though
20:21 <     etank> forget time
20:21 < Ubuntu-Ky> Ok etank
20:22 <    bkingx> that bot is a PAIN!!
20:22 <  montgoej> lol
20:22 <     etank> etank!
20:22 < Ubuntu-Ky> etank is code god. He can do it!
20:22 <     etank> but he is smart :)
20:23 <     etank> so who is up for meeting for coffee?
20:23 <  montgoej> maybe we should tell it to forget etank...
20:23 <     etank> :P montgoej 
20:23              montgoej is!
20:23              jkeyes0 +1
20:23 <    bkingx> +5
20:23              X626 +1
20:23              etank +100
20:23 <     etank> k
20:23 <     etank> so when 
20:23 <    bkingx> Carmel Macchiato!!
20:24 <     etank> i am assuming that lexington is closer to everyone than louisville
20:24 <     etank> we should really switch from town to town though
20:24 <  montgoej> I vote lexington, I'm there way more often
20:24 <     etank> so that those farther from lexington dont always have to drive so far
20:25 <     etank> im good for lexington too
20:25 <    bkingx> Let's do north-west so folks don't have to go all the way through town.
20:25 <    bkingx> Versailles rd area? 
20:26 <     etank> any ideas on a date yet?
20:26 <    bkingx> Old Frankfort, Leestown?
20:27 <     etank> i would say this Saturday but jkeyes0 wont be in town
20:27 <     etank> how about next thursday night
20:27 <   jkeyes0> sadly, no. but if enough people are up for it, don't mind me. I can always make the next one
20:27 <   jkeyes0> next thursday would be good too.
20:27 <     etank> in place of a normal meeting
20:27 <    bkingx> That sounds good
20:28 <     etank> but can montgoej and X626 make it?
20:28 <   jkeyes0> good point. school night and what not
20:28 <  montgoej> I probably can't, but it's alright
20:28 <     etank> no it aint
20:28 <      X626> I won't know just yet.  However, I doubt it.
20:28 <     etank> if possible i would like to have a day that works for a large part of the group
20:28 <     etank> so we can have as many as possible there
20:29              bkingx nods
20:29 <     etank> jkeyes0: will you be gone all weekend
20:29 <     etank> will you be back on Sunday?
20:30 <   jkeyes0> I will be back sunday afternoon/evening. I can try to be back earlier, but it's hard to get away from the family.
20:30 <     etank> nivek: how about you?
20:30 <     etank> what if we met at Starbucks on Sunday 
20:31 <     etank> montgoej and X626 could you make it then?
20:31 <   jkeyes0> ooh, starbucks. I've got a giftcard there. :)
20:31 <  montgoej> I might be able to
20:31 <      X626> Probably.
20:31 <  montgoej> I'll have to see, but I should be able to
20:31 <     etank> what if we met around 4 or so
20:31 <     etank> that way everyone can make it to church
20:31 <     etank> if they go
20:31 <  montgoej> sounds good
20:32              etank says that they should too
20:32 <     etank> :)
20:32 <     etank> vote?
20:32 <      X626> Sounds good to me
20:32              montgoej +5
20:32              jkeyes0 +1
20:33              bkingx +1

20:34 <    bkingx> isn't there one at Leestown and New Circle?
20:35 <     etank> i dont know
20:35 <    bkingx> There's one at Versailles and Parkers Mill
20:36 <     etank> i dont really care where
20:36 <     etank> as long as there is coffee
20:37 <   jkeyes0> versailles rd would be good. I'll have to talk to the wife about it (shouldn't be a problem, just want to make sure she's aware)
20:37 <    bkingx> Bring her along
20:37 <     etank> that works for me
20:38 <     etank> yeah bring your wifes too
20:38 <     etank> if you have one that is
20:38 <   jkeyes0> we'll have to take the dog back to the house before coming
20:38 <     etank> bring the dog too :O)
20:38 <   jkeyes0> they allow dogs in starbucks? :P
20:39 <     etank> the one near where i live leaves doggy biscuts outside for them
20:39 <  montgoej> well guys, I gotta go early, but I'll read the logs online
20:39 <  montgoej> I should be there sunday, but I'm not completely sure
20:39              <   montgoej!n=jordan@unaffiliated/montgoej ["Leaving"]
20:39 <     etank> ok then, last topic
20:40 <     etank> 3) CDs. I still have a ton of CDs if anyone wants some.
20:40 <    bkingx> Me too
20:40 <     etank> i have about 300
20:40              jkeyes0 raises hand. I'm taking my last one to the parents this weekend, and while I've still got 6.06 CD's at work, it'd be nice to have some 7.04's to hand out.
20:40 <     etank> i will bring then to the coffee shop then
20:41 <      X626> I could use some to try to give away at school.
20:41 <     etank> anyone that wants one (or lots) can have them
20:41 <   jkeyes0> awesome. are they all ubuntu, or are there kubuntu/xubuntu as well?
20:41 <     etank> kubuntu, edubuntu, ubuntu, 32bit and 64bit
20:41 <     etank> they dont ship xubuntu at shipit
20:42 <   jkeyes0> I'd love a few Kubuntu CDs as well, if possible.
20:42 <     etank> no problem
20:42 <     etank> i will bring all that i have
20:42 <     etank> take as many as you want
20:42 <     etank> we should be getting more in October anyway
20:42 <      Zuph> Shit, I was AFT
20:42 <   jkeyes0> nice!
20:42 <      Zuph> *AFK
20:42 <      Zuph> Now I'm back
20:43 <     etank> but they will be Gutsy
20:43 <      Zuph> Forgot to close the laptop :9
20:43 <      Zuph> :(
20:43 <     etank> wb Zuph 
20:43 <     etank> Zuph: i will try to bring you up to speed
20:43 <     etank> we are going to meet at starbucks on Sunday 
20:43 <     etank> this week
20:44 <      Zuph> The one off Man O War that we went to last time?
20:44 <     etank> we are going to meet on the 11th at bkingxs house to work on some Charity PCs
20:45 <      Zuph> Sounds good.
20:45 <     etank> Zuph: the one on versailles rd
20:45 <     etank> can you make it this weekend
20:45 <      Zuph> I'll get specifics when I'm not wasting time during the meeting.
20:45 <      Zuph> Yeah.
20:45 <     etank> sweet
20:45 <    bkingx> That should be the closer ones for the those from Frankfort and L'ville.
20:46 <    bkingx> So, 4:00 on this Sun for coffee?
20:46 <    bkingx> Last about an hour?
20:46 <     etank> Zuph: the last topic was that i still have sooooooo many CDs
20:46 <     etank> i am going to bring them with me and anyone that wants them can have them
20:46 <      Zuph> Works for me.  Plan on an hour, let it run til whenever?
20:47 <    bkingx> Right
20:47 <     etank> thats the plan
20:47 <    bkingx> Then the 11th at 2:00 for test, cleanup, inventory and then movie and pizza?
20:48 <     etank> thats the plan
20:48 <    bkingx> Cool!
20:48 <      Zuph> Sounds awesome.
20:48 <    bkingx> That's the plan then
20:48 <     etank> does anyone have any questions or anything at all to add?
20:48 <      Zuph> Any interest in a Cup of Ubuntu:  Ville Version any time soon?
20:49 <      Zuph> There seem to be a lot of members on the forums that are from Louisville and surrounding areas, and I'd love to get these people active
20:49 <      Zuph> I'll send out a mailing list mail for those guys.
20:50 <    bkingx> cool
20:50 <     etank> Zuph: we were talking about doing on month in lex and the next in louis
20:50 <     etank> Zuph: if you can get something going there then go for it
20:50 <      Zuph> etank: Is there going to be enough overlap that they need such a large separation?
20:50 <     etank> i think that would be great
20:51 <     etank> i dont know
20:51 <     etank> my fear is making the wife mad :{
20:51 <      Zuph> ?
20:51 <     etank> too many trips from the house and all
20:51 <    bkingx> yup
20:51 <      Zuph> Is there anyone here that WOULD go to the Louisville coffee thing if it was a month after the Lextown one but wouldn't otherwise?
20:52 <     etank> i would still try to go no matter when it is
20:52 <    bkingx> I can't promise anything, but I would like to make it up there.
20:52 <      Zuph> I mean, I don't want to make it a malicious act of scheduling conflicts.
20:52 <    bkingx> And we might be able to get vanload to go.
20:53 <    bkingx> I say do it
20:53 <      Zuph> How about this:  Plan on me doing a Louisville coffee meetup this month with the goal of getting Louisville guys more active, and then a bigger Louisville meetup next week.
20:53 <      Zuph> That way there's not pressure on you guys to make it to a meetup that might anger the wives.
20:53 <    bkingx> Sounds good to me.
20:54 <    bkingx> It would be great to get those Louisville guys more involved/
20:54 <      Zuph> I mean, Louisville people shouldn't have an issue making two meetings in a month if it's local, but for you guys it's more of a problem because of the drive.
20:56 <     etank> sounds good
20:56 <    bkingx> Cool...I think we got alot accomplished then
20:56 <   jkeyes0> next week when? sunday?
20:57 <      Zuph> For Louisville?
20:57 <   jkeyes0> yea
20:57 <    bkingx> This Sunday for coffee, next Saturday for machine cleanup.
20:57 <    bkingx> I'll email directions with RSVP this week.
20:57 <     etank> wait
20:57 <     etank> this sunday is lexington coffee right?
20:57 <   jkeyes0> yes
20:57 <    bkingx> yes
20:58 <     etank> what is the date for the Louisville one Zuph 
20:58 <      Zuph> TBA?
20:58 <      Zuph> I'll send a mailing list letter out and see when people are most available
20:58 <      Zuph> and if people don't decide, then I'll just pick a date
20:58 <      Zuph> It will be clear at least 7 days ahead of time, though.
20:58 <      Zuph> Sound good?
20:59 <     etank> cool
21:00 <     etank> good meeting all
21:00 <    bkingx> Yup!
21:00 <    bkingx> Time to settle in.  Been a long day
