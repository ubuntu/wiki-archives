__TOC__

=== My bug is Fix Committed but the fix is not in the kernel? ===

Once a fix has been reviewed and approved on the Kernel Team email list it will then be applied to the kernel git tree.  When sufficient updates have accumulated a <code>-proposed</code> kernel will be uploaded; you need the proposed pocket enabled to get these kernels.  It can take some time before these changes are uploaded, however every day the tree is checked and if there are any new patches a new pre-proposed kernel is automatically uploaded to the kernel team pre-proposed PPA <code>ppa:~kernel-ppa/pre-proposed</code>.  Adding both the proposed pocket and the pre-proposed PPA will get you all pending fixes as soon as possible.  See <nowiki>[[Kernel-Dev-KernelTesting]]</nowiki> for details.
