__TOC__

All patches developed to fix a bug or add/improve new/existing functionality should be submitted to upstream first. The Ubuntu kernel maintainers prefer that these patches come to Ubuntu kernel though upstream. But for any reason you wish to submit a ''sauce'' or ''config'' patch to the ubuntu kernel mailing list, please follow the process below.

* Use the appropriate <nowiki>[[Kernel-Action-CommitTemplates | commit template]]</nowiki> when you commit your changes.
* Use git format-patch -1 to generate your patch file. 
* After you push your changes to your remote git tree use git request-pull to generate a pull request.
* Submit your patch with a request pull message to the Ubuntu Kernel Mailing list. Ubuntu Kernel Team <kernel-team@lists.ubuntu.com>
