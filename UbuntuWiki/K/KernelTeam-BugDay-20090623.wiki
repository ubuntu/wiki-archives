== Canonical Kernel Team Bug Day ==

The focus of today's bug day will be bugs with an open upstream bug watch and old incomplete bugs.  Each developer has a list of 20 bugs to focus on.  The goal for the bugs with an upstream bug watch is to make sure the bug reporters have tested with the upstream mainline kernel in order to help provide better feedback to the upstream bug report as well as the Launchpad bug report.

There is also a community section for anyone else wanting to help out.  The community section is composed of Triaged bugs which may need to be verified with the upstream kernel.  Feel free to drop into the #ubuntu-kernel IRC channel on FreeNode if you have any questions.

=== Developer Sections: Bugs with an open upstream bug watch ===
# Confirm the upstream bug watch indeed correlates the the launchpad bug, else close it or find the right upstream bug to link to.
# Check that the bug has been confirmed against the Jaunty release.
## If not, ask them to test Jaunty as well as the upstream kernel (see Stock Reply)
** Set the status to Incomplete, tag "needs-upstream-testing"
# If the bug has been confirmed against Jaunty, verify updated logs for Jaunty are attached.
## If logs ate not provided, ask for logs and upstream testing (see Stock Reply)
## If logs are provided, check if the bug has also been tested with the upstream mainline kernel
** If not tested with the upstream mainline kernel, ask them to test with the upstream mainline kernel (see Stock Reply)
*** Set status to Confirmed, tag "needs-upstream-testing"

=== Developer Sections: Old Incomplete Bugs ===
# If the last comment is more than 6 weeks old and the requested information has not been provided, close the bug as Won't Fix (see Stock Reply)
# If the requested information has been provided, make sure the latest Jaunty release has been tested as well as tested with the latest upstream kernel (see Stock Reply)
# If the issue has been confirmed against the latest Jaunty release and tested with the upstream kernel, move the bug from Incomplete to Triaged (or In Progress if you want to work on the bug).

=== Community Section: Triaged Bugs ===
# Check that the bug has been confirmed against the Jaunty release.
## If not, ask them to test Jaunty as well as the upstream kernel (see Stock Reply)
** Set the status to Incomplete, tag "needs-upstream-testing"
# If the bug has been confirmed against Jaunty, verify updated logs for Jaunty are attached.
## If logs are not provided, ask for logs and upstream testing (see Stock Reply)
## If logs are provided, check if the bug has also been tested with the upstream mainline kernel
** If not tested with the upstream mainline kernel, ask them to test with the upstream mainline kernel (see Stock Reply)
*** Set status to Confirmed, tag "needs-upstream-testing"

== Tools ==
Here are references to some useful tools that may help you more efficiently process the list of bugs.

=== greasemonkey ===

https://launchpad.net/launchpad-gm-scripts

http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~gm-dev-launchpad/launchpad-gm-scripts/master/files

This is a collection of greasemonkey scripts which Launchpad users and Ubuntu developers have found useful.  For the purpose of Bug Day's, the <nowiki>[[http://bazaar.launchpad.net/%7Egm-dev-launchpad/launchpad-gm-scripts/master/annotate/head%3A/lp_stockreplies.user.js|stockreplies gm-script]]</nowiki> will be the most useful.  The stockreplies script allows you to save custom comments to insert into bug reports and additionally set the status and importance of a bug at the same time.

=== launchpadlib ===
https://help.launchpad.net/API/launchpadlib

The launchpadlib library depends on wadllib, another open-source library released by the Launchpad team. Get a copy of the launchpadlib and wadllib source with bzr and install it.
<pre>
  $ bzr branch lp:wadllib
  $ cd wadllib
  $ sudo ./setup.py install
 </pre>
Then do the same for launchpadlib.
 <pre>
  $ bzr branch lp:launchpadlib
  $ cd launchpadlib
  $ sudo ./setup.py install
 </pre>

After installation you can write custom scripts to manipulate bug reports.  This is useful for dealing with a list of bugs which all require the same type of actions/comment.  For example, here is a <nowiki>[[http://qa.ubuntu.com/reports/ogasawara/lplib/stock-reply.py|stock-reply.py]]</nowiki> script which reads a list of bugs from a "stock.txt" file, posts a standard comment to each bug, transitions the status to Incomplete, and subscribes oneself to the bug report.  It's quicker to use a launchpadlib script for this rather than having to do a page load per bug in order to use the greasemonkey stockreplies. 

== Stock Replies ==
Here's some common stock replies that may apply to some of the bugs:

=== Test Jaunty, Test Upstream ===
<pre>
Unfortunately it seems this bug is still an issue.  Can you confirm this issue exists with the most recent Jaunty Jackalope 9.04 release - http://www.ubuntu.com/news/ubuntu-9.04-desktop .  If the issue remains in Jaunty, Please run the following command from a Terminal (Applications->Accessories->Terminal).  It will automatically gather and attach updated debug information to this report.

apport-collect -p linux-image-2.6.28-11-generic <bug #>

If you could also test the latest upstream kernel available that would be great.  It will allow additional upstream developers to examine this issue.  Refer to https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelMainlineBuilds .  Once you've tested the upstream kernel, please remove the 'needs-upstream-testing' tag.  This can be done by clicking on the yellow pencil icon next to the tag located at the bottom of the bug description and deleting the 'needs-upstream-testing' text.  Please let us know your results.

Thanks in advance.
</pre>
* Set status to Incomplete
* Tag "needs-kernel-logs" and "needs-upstream-testing"

=== Request Logs for Jaunty, Test Upstream ===
Note, it's a good idea to paste the actual bug number in the apport-collect command.

<pre>
Thanks for testing and confirming against the latest Jaunty released.  Please run the following command from a Terminal (Applications->Accessories->Terminal).  It will automatically gather and attach updated debug information to this report.

=== Confirmed for Jaunty, Test Upstream ===
<pre>
If you could also test the latest upstream kernel available that would be great.  It will allow additional upstream developers to examine this issue.  Refer to https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelMainlineBuilds .  Once you've tested the upstream kernel, please remove the 'needs-upstream-testing' tag.

* Set status to Confirmed
* Tag "needs-upstream-testing"

=== Old Incomplete ===
<pre>
This bug report is being closed because we received no response to the previous inquiry for information. Please reopen if this is still an issue in the current Ubuntu release, Jaunty Jackalope 9.04 - http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download.  If the issue remains in Jaunty, please test the latest upstream kernel build - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelMainlineBuilds .  To reopen the bug, click on the current status under the Status column and change the status back to "New".  Thanks.
</pre>
* Set status to Won't Fix
