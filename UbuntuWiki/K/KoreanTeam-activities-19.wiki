* At the booth of Ubuntu Korea LoCo Team, we had a laptop with a Ubuntu OS installed so people can try it out.
* We also had a online quiz event, which asks people about the Ubuntu related question, such as 'what is the code name of Ubuntu 18.04', or 'how long is LTS support for Ubuntu 18.04'. We gave some Ubuntu USBs to people who got it right.
