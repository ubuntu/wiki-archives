__TOC__

This is an incomplete design specification for settings, notifications, and other behaviors relating to keyboards.

=== Prompting to set up a keyboard ===

<nowiki>[[File:no-keyboard.png]]</nowiki>

Whenever no keyboard is detected, the “Keyboard” screen of System Settings should begin with the text “No keyboard detected”. The following text should depend on the situation.
* On a pocket PC: “You need to use a Bluetooth keyboard with this display. Make sure it is close to the phone and its batteries are charged.”
* On a PC: “Connect a keyboard via USB, or use a Bluetooth keyboard. If a Bluetooth keyboard isn’t detected, make sure its batteries are charged.”

As long as the screen is open, Bluetooth should be turned on to detect a Bluetooth keyboard. If it was off previously, it should turn off again if you exit the screen without connecting a keyboard.

Ubuntu should open the “Keyboard” screen of System Settings if all of these are true:
* you are using a PC, or a pocket PC with a non-touch external display in use;
* no keyboard has been detected;
* System Settings is not already the active app;
* System Settings “Bluetooth” or “Keyboard” screen is not already open.

(This is all parallel to <nowiki>[[MouseAndTouchpad#prompting|the design when no pointing device is connected]]</nowiki>.)
