=== Objectives ===

The Web Team's primary goal is to make sure that the KentuckyTeam website ROCKS.

=== Work to be done ===

For the time being, we have decided to let Canonical host our site.  We're currently working on developing the site and will be including features as we come across them.  Any suggestions should be posted on the team forum.

=== Join the team ===
