'''The Trinity Desktop Environment has moved to a yearly release cycle as of 2011 to ensure continued high quality releases, so Natty specific packages will not be available until later this year.'''

In the meantime, the packages for Ubuntu Maverick can be installed and used without issues under Ubuntu Natty.  Please see https://wiki.kubuntu.org/Kubuntu/Kde3/Maverick and http://www.trinitydesktop.org/news.php for more information.
