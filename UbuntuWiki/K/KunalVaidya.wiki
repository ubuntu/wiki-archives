=== Kunal Vaidya ===

Hi,

My name is Kunal Vaidya and I am an avid computer geek. I like to play around with the computer. Tinkering with the hardware , tweaking the settings , applications etc. I like to benchmark my system and I also do overclocking related stuff on my computer. I am very much interested in technology and things related to it.

The programming language I am most comfortable with is C. I hope to do some useful stuff with it some day. Right now I havn't contributed to the Ubuntu project in technical aspect.

I am mostly doing translations for the Ubuntu these day.
