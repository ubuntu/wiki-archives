== Kubuntu 6.06 Beta ==

The Kubuntu team is proud to present the beta release of Kubuntu 6.06 (Dapper Drake).  With Kubuntu 6.06 Beta comes many, many changes. 

'''Note: This is still a beta release. Do not install it on production machines. The final stable version will be released in June of 2006. '''

== Introduction ==

A lot of changes have taken place in this release of Kubuntu, and the following is a sample of them.  There were not Wiki pages for the different flight releases that came out so this is a collection of changes covering all flights.

== KDE 3.5.2 ==

The latest and greatest version of KDE has made it into this Beta install. Version 3.5.2 is full of desktop goodness! 

== New Live CD Installer ==

Kubuntu from the beginning has provided a live cd to showcase how great it is.  The big problem was that when you wanted to install it, a seperate disk was needed.  Now Kubuntu Beta live cd ships with the ability to install from the live disk.
Espresso has been rewritten for Kubuntu and allows for a quick and painless install from the Live CD.  The following screenshots will help you get everything installed and working.

== Add/Remove Programs ==

A lot of changes have been made to adept, the graphical front end for installing programs in Kubuntu.  One is a new Add/Remove Programs that makes installing the latest packages very easy.  KDE- and Gnome-related packages can be installed through Add/Remove Programs.

== Adept Update Notifier and Adept Updater ==

New to the Drake is an update notifier that prompts you when there are updates to your installed programs.  For those familiar with Windows Update, the program works the same.  A red triangle will appear in your systray and after double-clicking, it will prompt you for your password.  Enter in the password, click Fetch Updates and adept-updater will download the latest updates will show you a preview of what will be updated.  Select just the updates you would like, or all updates.  Sit back and wtach your system become current and update, all without a reboot.

Adept Updater will provide you with a list of new updates, and you can choose to either download all or only the ones you would like

== System Settings Changes ==

A lot of changes have been made to make System Settings a lot easier to both understand and use.  While there was a time that printing was unusable, this is now fixed in the Beta release.
