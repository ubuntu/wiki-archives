__TOC__

Been running Linux for about 5 years, Ubuntu for three of those.  I run Ubuntu on servers and desktops.

About 2 years ago I became the president of the Lexington Professional Linux Users Group.  (see here http://www.lplug.org) We try to cater to those people/compnaies running Linux/Open Source Software in a Professional environment.

I recently joined the Kentucky Lo''''''Co group and I hope to be helping them out in any way I can.
