Email: 
I am a new Linux convert and would love to be able to spread the love that I have found in Ubuntu to the rest of the fresh-faced Windows power users out there that feel that they are unable to convert as there really is noone local that they can discuss and troubleshoot their boxes with.

I am looking forward to getting to know everyone within this community and exchanging some great ideas with a lot of you.
