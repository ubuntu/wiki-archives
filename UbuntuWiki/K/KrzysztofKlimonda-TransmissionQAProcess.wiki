== Transmission QA Process ==
=== Foreword ===
This QA process is mainly aimed at the new bugfix-only releases that go through the Ubuntu SRU process and land in $release-updates. Below, there are some tests, that should be followed before changing tag from verification-needed to verification-done.
The main page about the SRU process is StableReleaseUpdates
=== Tests ===
The tests are grouped from the most important (Gtk+ client and the web interface) to the least important one (CLI tools). The idea is that if no one has yet tested new release, and the new tester doesn't have enough time to go through all tests, they should start from the top and, by doing them in order, test the most critical parts of the suite.
==== Gtk+ client ====
Gtk+ client is the only Transmission frontend in main repository, therefore its testing is most important.
