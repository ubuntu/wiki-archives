==== Devel Kernel Announcements ====
We hope to finally have a yakkety v4.6 based kernel in the archive by end of week.  Fingers crossed!

<nowiki>[[https://git.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-kernel/ubuntu/+source/linux/+git/yakkety]]</nowiki>

Our unstable branch has also been rebased to v4.8-rc5.

<nowiki>[[https://git.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-kernel/ubuntu/+source/linux/+git/unstable]]</nowiki>

Also, as noted in previous newsletters, we are also going to target a v4.8 based kernel for the 16.10 release.  We will likely skip uploading a v4.7 based kernel to the archive and go directly to v4.8.
