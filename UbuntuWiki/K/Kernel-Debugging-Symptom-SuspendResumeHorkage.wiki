=== I tried to suspend my machine and it apparently resumed immediately ===

If you have recently upgraded and not yet rebooted you are unable to suspend.  You can determine this from the colour of the power menu item, if this is ''red'' then you need to  restart your system (when convienient) before suspend is possible.

Otherwise you should refer to the DebuggingKernelSuspend guide.

=== I tried to suspend my machine and it did not turn off ===

This is often caused by the system hanging while attempting to suspend devices.  Please refer to the DebuggingKernelSuspend guide.

=== I tried to suspend my machine and it would not wake up ===

Please refer to the DebuggingKernelSuspend guide.

=== I tried to suspend my machine and it returned me to the login screen ===

This could either indicate that you have been logged out during resume, else the machine may have rebooted.  Please refer to the DebuggingKernelSuspend guide.
