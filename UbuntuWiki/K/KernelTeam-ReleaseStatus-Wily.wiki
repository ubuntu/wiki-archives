__TOC__

Wily is now open for development. With git support in LP recently getting stood up, we are going to be dogfooding maintaining our wily kernel git repo’s on LP. These will be mirrored to kernel.ubuntu.com.

For those interested:
git://git.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-kernel/ubuntu/+source/linux/+git/wily
git://git.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-kernel/ubuntu/+source/linux-meta/+git/wily
git://git.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-kernel/ubuntu/+source/linux-signed/+git/wily

We are initally tracking the 4.0.x stable series on wily master-next.
Tracking of the 4.1 series is going on in our unstable git repo on kernel.ubuntu.com. In the interim, the 3.19.0-16.16 kernel from Vivid has been copied and seeded in the archive for Wiley.
