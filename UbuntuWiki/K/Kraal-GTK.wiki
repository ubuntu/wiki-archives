=== Summary ===

Kraal-GTK is a graphical configuration frontend to <nowiki>[[http://udu.wiki.ubuntu.com/SoC-Firewall|Kraal]]</nowiki>.  It is planned as stand-alone application, so you do not need to install i.e. gnome-system-tools including all its dependencies.  Kubuntu useres are able to install gtk2-engines-gtk-qt to make Kraal-GTK almost look like an Qt application.

=== Design ===

Is consists of two modes, one for simple tasks and an advanced mode. Switching between these modes is possible by using a two-state button.

Supported in default mode are:
* Select which ports should be opened for incoming connections
* Add user defined rules
* Configure masquerading

Supported in advanced mode are:
* Select which ports should be opened for incoming and outgoing connections
* Create some complex packet-filter rules (as described in the section "services")
* Add user defined rules
* Configure different interfaces
* Configure masquerading
* Configure forwarding
* Configure logging
* Configure which icmp-packet is used when rejecting a connection
* Select whether invalid packets should be dropped (deactivated by default, since it breaks i.e. existing incoming ssh-connections when the firewall is restarted)
