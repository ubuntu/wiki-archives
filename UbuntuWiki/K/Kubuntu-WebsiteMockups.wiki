Just an idea, actually I was bored at the last LUG meeting and quickly came up with this.

I think we should have a website similiar to ubuntu.com. That shows shared identity and one trademark should use the same basic design. 
This is my first work with inscape and it is not a mockup of the complete website as it should be. I am not a good artist, maybe someone can improve this idea?
