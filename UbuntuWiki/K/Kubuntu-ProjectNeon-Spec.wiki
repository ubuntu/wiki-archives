__TOC__

== Packaging ==
Project Neon packages should be installed under /opt/project-neon/* so it is impossible to mistake it for something else.

Configuration files should be stored inside ~/.project-neon/{qt,kde} to prevent messing up the stable KDE settings.

We should also add ALL optional dependencies to ALL KDE packages so users have all bleeding edge features/bugs to crash their systems, whine and report bugs ;)

Anything else?

shadeslayer mentioned that we need an own season (own x… file)

Should we split for /opt/project-neon/{qt,kde}?
