=== Why does a local build produce such enormous packages? ===

Our build includes CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO in order to produce linux-debug-image packages. We then manually strip the modules after build.

If you re-use our config for your own build, your best bet is to change this line in the config:

<pre>
CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO=y
</pre>

To this:

    <pre>
</pre>
