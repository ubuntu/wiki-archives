=== Purpose ===

Our custom installation CD needs custom artwork to proudly display our work here at KyLoco.  This page can serve as a starting point for brainstorming, collaborating, and sharing our work.

Any questions/comments/concerns can be directed to KyleWright.

Visit the <nowiki>[[https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu-ky-projects/+spec/customartwork|Custom Artwork]]</nowiki> project on Launchpad.

=== ToDo ===

List all the custom artwork projects we need to work on here.

* Provide comments and feedback on work already posted below.
* Voice your opinion in the comments section or on the Custom Artwork forum thread.
* We need to choose which wallpaper should be the default

=== Works in Progress ===

If you are working on a custom artwork image, post it here.

==== Feisty Artwork Packages ====

NOTICE:  The custom artwork packages have now been finalized and uploaded to the testing repository.  Package sources are also in seperate bazaar branches on Launchpad.

Ubuntu Feisty comes, by default,  with the artwork packages listed below.  I have re-packaged them with our own custom artwork:
* ubuntu-artwork --> ubuntu-artwork-ky
* feisty-wallpapers --> feisty-wallpapers-ky
* feisty-gdm-themes --> feisty-gdm-themes-ky
* feisty-session-splashes --> feisty-session-splashes-ky

To install these packages, you can add the following testing repository to your apt sources, which is hosted on my personal server... (if it is down then try again during evening hours): 

<code> deb http://kyle-server.servehttp.com/apt / </code>

During installation, the original packages are uninstalled and replaced by the "-ky" packages.

NOTES:
* Thus far, the GDM theme will not install itself as the default theme.. this bug is being worked on at the moment.
* The wallpapers install and appear on the wallpapers list (right-click on Desktop.. etc).  Please test this package to see if a KY wallpaper is applied as the default.
* The splash screen package works as intended.  After installation and reboot, the KY splash screen will appear.

==== Team Logos (General Purpose) ====

==== GDM Themes ====

UPDATE: A customized Human GDM theme sporting the team logo and a "brought to you by.." message is now part of the artwork package "feisty-gdm-themes-ky"

==== Splash Images (Gnome and KDE) ====
