== Introduction ==

This page offers kernel bug triagers suggested responses that have been found effective in obtaining requested information.

== Request apport-collect ==

Sometimes, folks make reports manually, or against the wrong package initially (e.g. <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-meta|linux-meta]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-hwe|linux-hwe]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-xenial|linux-lts-xenial]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-signed|linux-signed]]</nowiki>, etc.). Once moved to the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux|linux]]</nowiki> package, one may request an apport collection:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <tablestyle="background-color: #eee"> Thank you for reporting this and helping make Ubuntu better. Could you please boot into a Ubuntu kernel (not third party kernel) and execute the following command only once, as it will automatically gather debugging information, in a terminal: <<BR>> apport-collect BUGNUMBER <<BR>><<BR>> Where BUGNUMBER is replaced with the number of your bug report.
|}

== Request full computer model ==

For some computers, while computer details may be provided via the Bug Description, the full computer manufacturer and model aren't provided, or the details aren't accurate. Hence, if one is interested in reviewing the computer specifications from the vendor's website, one may request this via:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <tablestyle="background-color: #eee"> Could you please provide from the the sticker of the computer itself (not from the Bug Description, or the result of a terminal command) the full computer model?
|}

== Request BIOS update ==

For some issues on some computers, the BIOS being outdated can cause various issues that seem due to Ubuntu itself. For example, hardware intermittently working, hardward not working at all, or what seems software dependent. Also, many upstream developers request this being updated, despite one having tested the latest mainline kernel, to help them rule out root causes. So, while it's not a requirement to have the BIOS updated before upstreaming, one is doing themselves, and upstream a great favor by ensuring it is. As a courtesy to the original reporter, one may provide the direct URL to the latest BIOS update, and note the version number.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <tablestyle="background-color: #eee"> As per your computer vendor's website, an update for the computer's buggy, insecure, and outdated BIOS is available. Could you please advise on how updating changes the issue following https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BIOSUpdate ? <<BR>><<BR>> For more on BIOS updates and linux, please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ReportingBugs. <<BR>><<BR>> Please note your current BIOS is already in the Bug Description, so there is no need to post this on the old BIOS, or create a new report. <<BR>><<BR>> If the problem is still reproducible after updating: <<BR>> 1) Please provide the output of the following terminal command (not perform an apport-collect): <<BR>> sudo dmidecode -s bios-version && sudo dmidecode -s bios-release-date <<BR>> 2) Please make a comment advising on how this improves the situation. <<BR>> 3) Please mark this Status Confirmed. <<BR>><<BR>> However, if this is no longer reproducible, please mark this Status Invalid. <<BR>><<BR>> Thank you for your help.

== Request testing latest mainline kernel ==

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <tablestyle="background-color: #eee"> In order to allow additional upstream mainline kernel developers to examine the issue, at your earliest convenience, could you please test the latest mainline kernel? Please keep in mind the following:<<BR>>1) The one to test is in a folder at the very top of the page (not the daily folder).<<BR>>2) The release names are irrelevant.<<BR>>3) The folder time stamps aren't indicative of when the kernel actually was released upstream.<<BR>>4) Install instructions are available at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/MainlineBuilds .<<BR>><<BR>> If testing on your main install would be inconvenient, one may: <<BR>> 1) Install Ubuntu to a different partition and then test this there. <<BR>> 2) Backup, or clone the primary install. <<BR>><<BR>> If the latest kernel did not allow you to test to the issue (ex. you couldn't boot into the OS) please make a comment in your report about this, and continue to test the next most recent kernel version until you can test to the issue. Once you've tested the mainline kernel, please comment on which kernel version specifically you tested. If this issue is not reproducible in the mainline kernel, please add the following tags by clicking on the yellow circle with a black pencil icon, next to the word Tags, located at the bottom of the Bug Description: <<BR>> kernel-fixed-upstream <<BR>> kernel-fixed-upstream-X.Y-rcZ <<BR>> <<BR>> Where X, and Y are the first two numbers of the kernel version, and Z is the release candidate number if it exists. <<BR>> <<BR>> If the issue is reproducible with the mainline kernel, please add the following tags: <<BR>> kernel-bug-exists-upstream <<BR>> kernel-bug-exists-upstream-X.Y-rcZ <<BR>> <<BR>> Please note, an error to install the kernel does not fit the criteria of kernel-bug-exists-upstream. <<BR>> <<BR>> Also, you don't need to apport-collect further unless specifically requested to do so. <<BR>> <<BR>> In addition, to keep this issue relevant to upstream, please continue to test the latest mainline kernel as it becomes available. <<BR>> <<BR>> Lastly, it is most helpful that after testing of the latest mainline kernel is complete, you mark this report Status Confirmed. <<BR>> <<BR>> Thank you for your help.

=== Request testing drm-tip kernel ===

If the issue is suspected to be drm related, it is helpful to be provided results while testing it.

== Request bisect ==

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <tablestyle="background-color: #eee"> The next step is to fully commit bisect from the most recent kernel version that worked, followed immediately by the next kernel version that did not work. This will allow for a direct review of the offending commit for either reverting, or further improvements. Could you please do this following https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/KernelBisection ? This article was written for folks who don't know anything about linux, so it's easy to follow. <<BR>><<BR>> Please note, finding adjacent kernel versions, or providing a commit without testing it and reverting it is not fully commit bisecting. <<BR>><<BR>> Also, the kernel release names are irrelevant for the purposes of bisecting. <<BR>><<BR>> It is most helpful that after the bad commit (not kernel version) has been confirmed via testing, you then mark this report Status Confirmed. <<BR>><<BR>> Thank you for your help.
|}

== Request reverse bisect ==

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <tablestyle="background-color: #eee"> The next step is to fully reverse commit bisect from the latest kernel version that did not work followed immediately by the next kernel version that did work. This will allow for a consideration of the fix commit for backporting. Could you please do this following https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/KernelBisection ? This article was written for folks who don't know anything about linux, so it's easy to follow. <<BR>><<BR>> Please note, finding adjacent kernel versions, or providing a commit without testing it and reverting it is not fully reverse commit bisecting. <<BR>><<BR>> Also, the kernel release names are irrelevant for the purposes of bisecting. <<BR>><<BR>> It is most helpful that after the fix commit (not kernel version) has been confirmed via testing, you then mark this report Status Confirmed. <<BR>><<BR>> Thank you for your help.
|}

== Request submit to upstream ==

It is most helpful to upstream that the original reporter provide all the information necessary for an upstream developer to begin working on it (ex. regressions bisected, latest upstream kernel tested, call trace captured, etc.). Also, it is helpful to original reporters to advise them which maintainer(s) to send this to, and which mailing list to CC as it is not always obvious.

=== DRM Intel ===

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <tablestyle="background-color: #eee"> The issue you are reporting is an upstream one. Could you please report this problem to Intel following their instructions via https://01.org/linuxgraphics/documentation/how-report-bugs? <<BR>><<BR>> Please note, pre-built builds of the drm-tip branch are available for Ubuntu from <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/MainlineBuilds]]</nowiki>. <<BR>><<BR>> Please provide a direct URL to your report so that it may be tracked. <<BR>><<BR>>Thank you for your help.
