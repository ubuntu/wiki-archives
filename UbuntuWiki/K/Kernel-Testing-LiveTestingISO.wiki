__TOC__

These images are meant to be a test case for persons interested in testing their hardware against the current development release. We hope that the LoCo teams will find this a useful feature for their Global Jams as well as testing ISOs for the Daily Live ISO which these images are built upon. As always, please report issues with the images to kernel-team@lists.ubuntu.com.

Current images can be found in the <nowiki>[[http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/testing/|Testing ISO Archive]]</nowiki>.  This archive includes two variants the Kernel Team Test Suite (''ktts'') and the Firmware Test Suite (''fwts''), for each there are amd64 and i386 variants.  The .iso images are for use with <code>usb-cd-creator</code>, the .img files can be directly dd'd to a USB stick.
