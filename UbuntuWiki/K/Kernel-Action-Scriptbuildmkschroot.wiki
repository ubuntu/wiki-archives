=== Usage of Script build-mkschroot ===

To automatically create the chroot environment use:

<pre>
chroot-setup/build-mkschroot [--arch=<arch>] <suite> <target-dir> [<mirror>]
</pre>

For example:

<pre>
sudo chroot-setup/build-mkschroot --arch=i386 hardy hardy-i386 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu
</pre>

Where:

*** arch stands for different arch supported by the CPU, for example i386 on AMD64 or LPIA on i386 etc.
*** suite stands for release name such as hardy, gutsy, intrepid etc.
*** target-dir stands for the directory where the chroot environment will be installed.
*** mirror stands for the http location to download environment from, http://host[:port]/dir/ 

Note: ''You don't need to specify a mirror when using the LPIA arch''
