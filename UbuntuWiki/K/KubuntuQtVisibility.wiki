__TOC__

Problems caused by the Qt Visibility=hidden patch in Kubuntu Feisty:

* pyqt and pykde ended up with their init functions hidden, so the modules could not be loaded
* scim/skim broke (maybe a recompile would have fixed it, but probably not)
* text selection broke, moving cursor backwards and forwards in a text box the cursor was not shown
* composite characters broke, so French people can't type their é

the last two are especially random.  So I removed the patch.
