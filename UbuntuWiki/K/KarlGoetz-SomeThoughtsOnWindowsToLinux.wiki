                '''Moving Windows users to Ubuntu, how it could be made eaiser.'''

This is a few thoughts based on my watching various people moved (yes, moved) to Linux from Windows. Although there are probably dozens of such documents on the web, I thought I would write my own (asxperie I do with all my doco). This wont be a comprehensive how to do, but it will mean I can get my thoughts down and if they want people can comment on them (see my email at the bottom). When I say "Ubuntu" I mean "Ubuntu Linux", not "Kubuntu Linux " or any of the other Ubuntu rip offs / other Linux based systems. These will use different applications, so this (very quick) move over (guide) would not be much use. I am going to talk about how you can use the Ubuntu live cd to try and make the transition easier. Basically, I think there should be 7 stages, which can be opted out of at almost any point. This point depends on what the stage is.

*** Stage 1. Demo the CD.

      You go to them (or they come to you) and you say this is Linux, its really neat. You put in the Ubuntu live cd, and fire it up. They (hopefully) like the look of it and decide they want to know more. You give them the usual spiel - safer, better help, latest thing, cheaper, compatible with Microsoft Office (which is what people care about) with the right settings, can be really user friendly, etc - and if they like it, leave them the cd and leave in the understanding that you're free to explain any questions they might have about the system or CD.
*** Stage 2. Start planning and training.

      These are the two most important parts of this move, and have a serious affect on the outcome of your attempt to move to Linux, and what happens in Stage 7 (The crusader leaves on other quests.) One of the many things that has to be taken into account is 'can Ubuntu/Linux run my specialist tool that I need to be able to use'? examples of these are MYOB and Photoshop, and while some tools (Photoshop for example again) can run under emulation, this is not usually a user friendly thing to be doing.
      Your planning should include the following points:
####### How well will people be able to learn the software?
####### Do we have any specialist software (MYOB for example) that needs to be worked around?
####### Can we work with the hassles involved in the short to medium term?

      And your planning should include:
####### When do we start training?
####### What training does everyone receive?
####### Who (if anyone) will get extra training?
####### What will that extra training cover?
####### Where can we get support for training?

*** Stage 3. New Software.

      They decide they like Ubuntu enough that moving a few boxes (or the whole network) over is an option. Because a change from Windows to Ubuntu is fairly extreem, in an attempt to reduce culture shock it might be wise to ease them into it. To do this we produce our live cd again, and stick it in a Windows box. The live cd usualy auto runs and you can choose to select software to install into Windows, of the type that they will be using in Ubuntu. Start by installing OpenOffice.org and Firefox, Thunderbird if you want them to use it in Ubuntu, or leave them using their current client, or even get them to use MS Outlook if you want them to learn Evolution later (the concepts are similar).
*** Stage 4. Re-Demo the CD.

      This is relatively important, but you could skip it if you wanted. Basically this step is re-showing them Ubuntu again and making sure they want to commit. If you want this step can be carried out 5 minutes before the next step (as it probably will) but should be carried out. If the idea of Ubuntu no longer appeals, then put in a good word for it, but don't force the point, as people who make decisions don't like their hands being forced. If they have decided against Linux, leave OpenOffice.org on the computers if at all possible (unless specifically requested to be taken off). It's worth leaving that in place, as it will make any future changes *much* easier. Trust me on this, for a lot of people the computer is the office software they use. If that core part of their life stays the same, they will be much happier to move.
*** Stage 5. Tentative commitment.

      Suppose they still like the idea of a move over to Ubuntu, what then? Depending how much time you have, how much disturbance you may cause, how much resistance there is, and how many boxes there are, you may want to move the network over a few systems at a time or all at once. How fast is entirely up to you and the people who want to be/are being moved over. A good guess is about 4 at a time, less if you're not experienced at such a transition. Moving about 4 at a time is so that your tech support calls are manageable, rather then having 10 upset people suddenly realise they cant get 'the stupid computer' to do some really important thing that had to be done 15 minutes ago. This is the other benefit of having the people use OpenOffice.org (or whatever they need to be using) in Windows, all the minor changes are reasonably familiar at the Ubuntu switch, and small changes won't result in a tech support call.
*** Stage 6. Total move over.

      This is the bit where (depending on your perspective) the job gets easier or harder. It is easier because there are extra hacks (such as samba) are required to get linux and Windows networked. By having a totally Ubuntu environment, you dispose of many of these problems, but introduce several unique ones. Examples of these problems are people trying to email Windows users SXW files (the format used by Star Office and OpenOffice.org), who can't open it because all they have is Microsoft Office.
*** Stage 7. The crusader leaves on other quests.

      So the person who just helped you through to this stage has moved on, and a problem arises. What happens now is very much a result of what happened during the planning stage. If both parties worked out proper training and maintenance before and during the move, this stage can be a disaster or a breeze.
          o Disaster option:

            You (both parties) don't plan ahead. After getting the network and PCs running 'well enough' your crusader departs, leaving you with no idea how to get help or use what help you have. You don't know that it is possible to get more help then you could ever want by looking on the internet, so you (in the most expensive case) have someone come and move the entire lot back to Windows, costing you downtime and thousands of dollars in new licenses.
          o Positive outcome:

            The two parties realise that the crusader can't always be available, and so decide its probably best to organise several 'known good' ways of finding help, with several 'fall back' help locations (such as the original crusader). The users are able to use their new system and have learned something into the bargain (Ubuntu), and may even try it at home if they are adventurous people and want to try and develop new skills. The network is hopefully more functional and stable then it was with Windows, and more secure for added bonus.
