__TOC__

This page tracks the things that need to be done by an installer for the LiveCD.

=== The Plan ===

* I started with Willmer's hoary installation guide available <nowiki>[[http://www.willmer.com/kb/2005/02/installing-ubuntu-hoary-from-livecd/|here]]</nowiki>
* need to go through the knoppix-hdd-installer and morphix-installer

=== Current Issues ===

* needs to recreate initrd-img for some reason
* needs to copy/create useful /etc/hosts
* need to recreate hardware info upon install - copy from the RAM image
