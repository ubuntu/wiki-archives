Email: 
I'm using Linux for about five years starting with SuSE 9.0. Last year I switched to Kubuntu which now is running on my desktop computer and recently was installed on my notebook Averatec 3280. 
For years I try and manage to get my every day work as a photographer done using Linux.

Since I learned a lot about Linux from forums, wikis and the help offered by the community I want to share my knowlege now with others to pave the road for more people to using Linux.
