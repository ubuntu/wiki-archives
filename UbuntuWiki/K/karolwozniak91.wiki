My name is Karol Woźniak and I am programming enthusiast and Linux user since 2010. My first distribution was Debian. I remember till this day having hard times to configure it properly on my laptop. After a couple of months I switched to Ubuntu 10.04 and loved it to death. After hard but fruitful experience with Debian, in Ubuntu everything seemed so easy. I loved spending time with the distro and its desktop environment - Gnome back then. Now, when two things are merged again in the form of project called Ubuntu GNOME and the help is needed, there is no way I could ignore it. My main skills are programming in C and C++. I also have fun with scripting languages like lua recently. I would like to help to fix bugs and improve existing apps to make this distro even better.
