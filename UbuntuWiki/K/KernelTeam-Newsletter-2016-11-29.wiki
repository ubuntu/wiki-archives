==== Devel Kernel Announcements ====
We uploaded a newer v4.9 based Zesty kernel to the archive:

<nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/4.9.0-3.4 | https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/4.9.0-3.4]]</nowiki>

It is currently based on v4.9-rc7.  Please test and let us know your results.  We anticipate we'll eventually converge on a v4.10 based kernel for Zesty.
