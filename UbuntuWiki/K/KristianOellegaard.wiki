== KristianOellegaard ==

I've been using Ubuntu since 5.04 and after the 7.04 release i got most of the family on ubuntu as well.

Time by time, I'm hanging around the #ubuntu-dk IRC channel @freenode.net and launchpad, where I translate.

I work professionally with ubuntu server in my business <nowiki>[[http://www.prinkk.net|prinkk]]</nowiki>, where i develop and host django projects.
