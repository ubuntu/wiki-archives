=== What is Bug Triage? ===

Bug Triage is the process of vetting incoming bugs to ensure they have all the information they need to be worked on.  See <nowiki>[[Kernel-BugTriage-Process]]</nowiki> for details on the process itself, see <nowiki>[[Kernel-BugTriage]]</nowiki> for pointers on triaging.
