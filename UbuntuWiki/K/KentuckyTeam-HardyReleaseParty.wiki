=== What ===

We plan for this to be a very laid back time to meet one another and celebrate all things Ubuntu. The location has Wifi and a projector for presentations. And hopefully delicious cheesecake.

=== More Info ===

It has been discussed in IRC meetings and on the mailing list. Logs can be found at <nowiki>[[KentuckyTeam/Meetings/2008Mar27]]</nowiki>. Please feel free to post your ideas or join us in #ubuntu-kentucky on irc.freenode.net to discuss it more.

We hope to see everyone there :)
