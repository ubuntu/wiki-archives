=== What are Kernel Flavour transitions? ===

Over time the supported kernel flavours have evolved.  This means that sometimes it is necessary to move from one kernel flavour to another for a specific use case.  More details on why we might need such transitions, and information on the transitions which have been needed previously can be found on the <nowiki>[[Kernel-Dev-Flavours]]</nowiki> page.
