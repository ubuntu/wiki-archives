== Dealing with Kubuntu Packages ==

=== Why does this exist? ===

Kubuntu packages are special in that:
* We don't always take Debian's packaging and constantly maintain our own delta on (most) of our packages.
* Our packageset isn't always up to date - KDE packages new software in almost every release, and we can package this and get it in the archive, but we can't always update the packageset.
* KDE ships a release (or two) almost monthly, and that doesn't always align with Ubuntu development cycles.

This page exists in order to clear up some common misconceptions about how our packaging process works, and to ensure that anybody working on Kubuntu packages from the standpoint of the Ubuntu development community can effectively do so.

=== Our Workflow ===

==== KDE releases ====

==== Packaging location ====

==== KCI ====

==== Backports ====

=== Uploading to the archive ===
