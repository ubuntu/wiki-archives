=== Summary ===
Discuss the mainline baseline version for 13.04. Also discuss the current kernel flavors for each architecture.  We will also touch on the support of ports architectures.

* the v3.8 kernel is predicted for Wednesday, 2013-03-06
* the v3.9 kernel is predicted for Thursday, 2013-05-23
