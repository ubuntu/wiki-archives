== Introduction ==

Karmic Koala, the next version of Kubuntu, is due to be released on October 29, 2009

The focus for 9.10 for the Kubuntu community will be refining the KDE desktop experience while at the same time reaching out to new, exciting features. The plan is to continue maintaining our excellent KDE packages while developing tools to make managing your desktop and communicating with your friends easier. Karmic is the first station on the way to a more sociable and powerful desktop seen nowhere else.

'''NOTE:''' ''This is a beta (pre-) release. Pre-release versions of 9.10 are '''__NOT__''' encouraged for anyone needing a stable system or for anyone not comfortable running into occasional, even frequent, breakage. Pre-release versions of 9.10 '''__ARE__''' recommended for Kubuntu developers and those who want to help in testing, reporting, and fixing bugs. Please do not use this in a production environment with data or workflows that you cannot do without.''

== New or Improved In this Beta ==

Pretty much everything!!

The Karmic Koala Beta CD release brings with it a brand new desktop as well as many new fixes and applications. For this latest release of Kubuntu 9.10, we are adding several interesting features to the desktop experience, building on the latest KDE. Besides these changes, there have been updates to many common applications as well as bug fixes to some of those annoyances you may or may not have run into. With every new pre-release, updates will be documented allowing you to thoroughly test your new Kubuntu test installation. Remember that all of these features are part of a pre-release version of Kubuntu, and may still have issues. We ask that any problems you come across that you file a bug, if one has yet to be filed for your problem.<<BR>>

=== KDE 4.3.1 ===

<nowiki>[[File:screen1-wee.png]]</nowiki>

KDE has recently released 4.3 of their amazing desktop environment. There are many changes including bug fixes, new functionality, and more. Some of these changes include, but are not limited to:
* Significant refinements of Plasma and KWin, the KDE workspace
* Many improvements
*** Refinement of the Plasma desktop shell
*** New features all around
* New and Improved Applications
* and more...
For Karmic Beta, KDE includes the first bug fix release of KDE 4.3, 4.3.1.
For complete details of the KDE 4.3 release, please consult http://kde.org/announcements/4.3/.

=== Netbook Technical Preview ===
<nowiki>[[File:KNE_u_i_300x175.jpeg]]</nowiki>

Kubuntu Netbook Edition for 9.10 is the first release for this new Ubuntu variant.  It is optimized for netbook systems (usually a 9 or 10 inch display) with a minimum vertical screen resolution of 576 pixels.  It is built on the same KDE 4.3 base as Kubuntu, but uses a technical preview version of KDE's forthcoming Plasma Netbook to provide the basic 'desktop' environment.  Kubuntu has worked with the Plasma Netbook developers to provide a basic first look at the initial, small part of KDE's vision for supporting netbooks.

Kubuntu Netbook Edition 9.10 will be useful for many, but is not for everyone.  It provides an early look at the plasma shell that will enable people to interact with standard KDE applications in a way optimized for netbook systems.  It is useful, functional, and reliable.  It does have a few rough edges, but should be usable by many people without problems.

The complete version of the KDE netbook experience will be released with KDE 4.4 in January and as part of Kubuntu Lucid Lynx (10.04).  The current preview is a first effort towards this completed vision for a radically better experience on mobile, low power, net oriented systems.  

Plasma Netbook has most basic functionality now and is complete for this cycle.  usb-creator-kde should work to copy the ISO onto a USB disk for your netbook. You can also install by burning a DVD.  More details on Plasma Netbook can be found <nowiki>[[Kubuntu-NetbookPlasma|here]]</nowiki>. 

=== Social from the Start ===

This release has an emphasis on connecting you to your online social networks.

New social features include:
** The KDE '''Microblogging Plasma widget''' as part of the default desktop experience for your identi.ca and Twitter fix
** The '''Google Calendar Plasma widget''' is available for adding to your desktop
** The '''Facebook Plasma widget''' lets you stay up to date with your friends, also available for adding to your desktop
** The '''Facebook Kopete plugin''' so that you can chat with your Facebook contacts from the comfort of the default chat client.  This is still at an experimental stage, let us know how it works on the Feedback page below.
** '''KDE Image plugins''' let you connect to Flickr and other photo sites from Gwenview and Digikam
** '''Choqok''' is available to install for a full microblogging setup.
** The '''OpenDesktop Social Plasma widget''' is ready for your desktop to connect you to your free software neighbours

=== OpenOffice KDE integration ===
<nowiki>[[File:openoffice-kde-wee.png]]</nowiki>

Written by our very own elite Kubuntu developers, OpenOffice 3.1.1 introduces KDE integration. This means that all OpenOffice applications will look at home with the default "Oxygen" KDE theme and use the KDE file dialog for opening and saving documents.

=== Message Indicator ===
<nowiki>[[File:message-indicator-message.png]]</nowiki>

A new message indicator has been added which currently has a plugins for Konversation, Quassel, Kopete and Kontact.  No need to be distracted by IRC pings, instant message chats, or new emails when you don't want to be, but easy to find out who has been leaving messages for you when you want to.

=== Installer Bling ===
<nowiki>[[File:ubiquity-wee.png]]</nowiki>

Our installer has a fresh new look.

=== Amarok 2.2 RC ===
<nowiki>[[File:screen2-wee.png]]</nowiki>

Amarok 2.1.90 is the release candidate in the Amarok 2.2 series.  It brings back some feature previously missing in Amarok 2 and adds polish & customisation possibilities to the user interface.

=== KPackageKit ===
<nowiki>[[File:kpackagekit2.png]]</nowiki>

Kubuntu 9.10 will include the latest release of KPackageKit. Key features added since Kubuntu 9.04 are new notifications, sweet animations, a history feature, usability fixes and a more robust overall experience with fewer bugs.

''Note PackageKit is broken in the beta, this is obviously a priority to fix''

=== K3b 2 (alpha 2) ===
<nowiki>[[File:screen4-wee.png]]</nowiki>

One of the last KDE 3 mainstays of previous releases, K3b has now been ported to KDE 4.

=== Userconfig 0.9 ===
<nowiki>[[File:userconfig1.png]]</nowiki>

Everybody's favorite user management tool from the KDE3 days has been resurrected for Kubuntu 9.10. Userconfig offers a simple user interface as well as integration with System Settings.

KUser, the application that handled this in the recent past, has been relegated to the DVD, as it still has LDAP tools that might be useful to some.

=== NetworkManager applet ===

The NetworkManager applet has received some loving from its creators, and offers a more robust networking experience than it did in Kubuntu 9.04.

=== GTK+ Integration ===
<nowiki>[[File:screen5-wee.png]]</nowiki> <nowiki>[[File:kcm-gtk2.png]]</nowiki>

QtCurve 0.68.0 brings a refinement of the Oxygen-like widget style so that your GNOME apps will look more at home in KDE.

GTK+ widget style and fonts can now be configured from KDE.

=== Web browser ===
==== Konqueror by default ====
It has been decided that the default web browser to be shipped with Kubuntu 9.10 will continue to be Konqueror. It was decided that its superior integration with KDE was worth more than the hassle of switching default web browsers a lot.  However, Arora 0.10 will still be shipped on the DVD for those who want to use Arora for its superior performance with social web applications such as Facebook.

==== Firefox Installer ====
<nowiki>[[File:firefox_install1.png]]</nowiki>

For fans of Firefox, installing this excellent browser will be a piece of cake in Kubuntu 9.10. We have included a simple installer for Firefox that appears where Firefox would normally appear in the "Internet" menu. While we cannot provide Firefox by default due to CD size constraints, this is the next best option.

=== Screenshots ===

* Screenshots for Ubuntu Beta are available here http://www.thecodingstudio.com/opensource/linux/screenshots/index.php?linux_distribution_sm=Ubuntu%209.10%20Beta
* Screenshots for Kubuntu Beta are available here http://www.thecodingstudio.com/opensource/linux/screenshots/index.php?linux_distribution_sm=Kubuntu%209.10%20Beta
=== Known Issues ===

* There are still issues with KDM logout.  Kubuntu Karmic systems are generally unable to logout and then log in as a different user.  ''Cntl-Alt-F1'' for a console and run ''sudo stop kdm; sudo start kdm'' for a workaround.
* KPackageKit does not install software
