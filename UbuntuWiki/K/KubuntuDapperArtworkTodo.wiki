Things to do for dapper artwork

* metabar theme
* make sure usplash image doesn't look so squashed (but preferably still looks ok on e.g. powerpc where it doesn't get scaled), how does ubuntu image do this?
* usplash down? (i.e. usplash while halting the machine) (<nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/bugs/35151|#35151]]</nowiki>) - DONE, with some issues
* new usplash image should be also used in gfx-boot of the installer (not changed yet in Flight6)
* hightlight color for menu/list items is very dark and causes problems for:
*** Open``Office.org/Firefox menu - <nowiki>[[http://img149.imageshack.us/img149/3927/ooomenu6ow.png|black on dark blue]]</nowiki> - KDE app menus are fine (white on blue)
*** Kerry - <nowiki>[[http://img210.imageshack.us/img210/1958/kerry7dh.png|blue on dark blue]]</nowiki>
* make background/kdm background images to fit 1920x monitors (<nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/bugs/35123|#35123]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/bugs/35133|#35133]]</nowiki>) - DONE 
*** only bubbles are stretched on wide screen (not much of issue)
* new icon for adept update alert - red triangle + adept box icon
* window manager buttons (assuming crystal works OK for everyone, raphink said he had problems)
* bluetooth apps have same icon, different icon for chat and file transfer?
* make espresso look pretty http://kubuntu.org/~jriddell/espresso/screenshots/
* example content for kubuntu
* exchange header pics in the help system (if time allows and it doesn't get too complicated)
* Cursor theme?
* Launch picture, something to put on kubuntu.org next to the release story
* Espresso icon, crystalise {{http://people.ubuntu.com/~cjwatson/bzr/espresso/ubuntu/desktop/espresso.png}} http://people.ubuntu.com/~cjwatson/bzr/espresso/ubuntu/desktop/espresso.svg
