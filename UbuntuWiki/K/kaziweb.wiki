=== About Me ===

This is Kazi Shahnoor Ashraf. My screen name is kaziweb. I have started with Red Hat Linux before Ubuntu. I have started my Ubuntu journey from 9.04 Distro. I fall in love with Ubuntu because of it's awesome community and it's contribution system. I found there was no Ubuntu activity in Qatar and at the same time I'm always an Ubuntu contributor in any form, and I formed Ubuntu Qatar LoCo Team. 

I am leader and admin of Ubuntu Qatar Loco Team. I am trying to spread Ubuntu in Qatar in different ways. We are continuously conducting Ubuntu Hours. Here we provide support to users and making plans to spread Ubuntu. I've created all possible and major channels to spread Ubuntu. Presently, I am getting good response from computer users, they are getting attracted and converting. Team members increasing day by day. 
 
==== Socially ====

As an Ubuntu Activist I feel, advocacy for Ubuntu is my duty. I always encourage my friends and giving them full support continuously. I'm living in Qatar. Here people are now aware of Ubuntu. I'm always informing and promoting Ubuntu for their daily use, showing them how they can use Ubuntu on their professional and Personal life. 

==== Professionally ====

Presently, I am a Businessman before I was in IT profession. In IT my last job position was IT Manager. Now I use Ubuntu for my office as well for all computing needs. Being a businessman I have more opportunity to spread Ubuntu. My office itself is a place of Ubuntu demonstration.
