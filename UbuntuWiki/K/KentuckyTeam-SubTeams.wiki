=== Teams ===

We currently have 4 Teams. They are:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <nowiki>[[KentuckyTeam/WikiTeam|Wiki Team]]</nowiki>
| <nowiki>[[KentuckyTeam/WebTeam|Web Team]]</nowiki>
| <nowiki>[[KentuckyTeam/NewMembers|New Members]]</nowiki>
| <nowiki>[[KentuckyTeam/CharityProject|Charity Project]]</nowiki>
|}
If you have an interest in helping in any (or all) of the teams then go to the page and at the bottom click '''Members'''. Then you can add your name to the list of team members. We may in the future create Sub-Teams on Launchpad to that it will be easier to track.
