__TOC__

There is always a desire to ship the latest version of any software product; including boot loaders. However, upgrading a boot loader can be a frightening and risky procedure. Currently, the primary boot loader for x86 platforms is Grub. This boot loader has not been updated since the year 2006 and it is getting 'long in the tooth'. Grub does not support newer BIOS firmwares such as EFI and there is no intention that it ever will.

There is a replacement for Grub, which has been in development for approximately 6 years now; it is called Grub2. Switching to Grub2 would provide support for newer computer systems, internationalization, 'updates', 'bug fixes' and other improvements.

So, it is believed everyone would like to switch the default boot loader to Grub2. This upgrade makes sense and it allows development to move forward. Why don't we just replace Grub, then? There is one important question that needs to be answered. Is every computer system supported by Grub2 which Grub currently supports? This question is difficult to answer unless sufficient testing has been completed. That's where this page comes in.

=== Testing Grub2 ===

If you are using (Jaunty Jackalope) or later, then Grub2 can be installed as a chain-loading boot loader and in parallel with your existing Grub installation. This will allow booting into Grub and selecting Grub2 from the boot loader menu. Then, you can test Grub2 for any problems before upgrading from Grub.

Even, if you are only able to test your computer by using Grub2 as a chain-loading boot loader; this would give the development team more information as to the viability of Grub2.

=== Before Testing ===

'''Note: If you perform this upgrade from (Jaunty Jackalope) then, YOUR COMPUTER WILL NOT BOOT FROM THE HDD. Read and follow the instructions about changing "root" to "UUID" below.'''

Though, it is less likely you will have any issues when attempting a boot loader update; we strongly recommend that you take the necessary precautions for such a procedure. It is recommended that you have a current backup of your computer system before attempting this. You have backups, right? Also, it is recommended that you have a bootable optical drive or bootable USB disk available. Should you be unable to boot after the installation, then you can boot from one of these devices to repair the installation.

=== How To Install Grub2 ===

<pre>
sudo apt-get install grub-pc
</pre>

At the first prompt, select OK. Next, at the "Chainload from menu.lst" prompt answer "Yes". And at the "Linux command line:" prompt just press the Enter key.

This will install Grub2 and modify the existing Grub boot loader menu, allowing one to chain-load Grub2 for testing on your computer. At this stage, the original Grub is still the primary boot loader, keeping its original boot menu items.

'''Note: Only in (Jaunty Jackalope) was there a bug in the Grub2 installer, (<nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/376879|LP#376879]]</nowiki>), where it modifies the existing Grub configuration incorrectly. If you experience this problem, at the "Chainload into Grub 2" menu item, press 'e' to edit the configuration. Press 'e' a second time to edit the top boot line and change:

<pre>
root   xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
</pre>

to:

<pre>
uuid   xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
</pre>

and press the Enter key after editing this line. Then press 'b' to chainload and boot Grub2.

Note: xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx is your partition UUID number.

If you can boot from Grub2 successfully, then you can install Grub2 onto your computer system as the main boot loader using the command:

<pre>
sudo upgrade-from-grub-legacy
</pre>

NOTE: Make sure that you hit the space bar to select /dev/sda when it asks you the location where Grub needs to be installed. If you hit enter on this screen it will not install Grub on /dev/sda and your system will not boot. 

=== User Errors ===
If you hit enter and Grub reports an error boot, then you need to boot the system from a bootable drive; such as a USB Flash Drive or Optical Drive. On my laptop, root is located on /dev/sda2 and /boot is located on /dev/sda1, you can find this out by the command 

<pre>
$sudo fdisk -l
</pre>

mount each to see which /dev/sda has what. Once you done that you need to mount your root 1st, in my case /dev/sda2

<pre>
$sudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt
</pre>

if you ls your /mnt you should see /boot, /dev, /home etc from your HDD. Now mount your /boot in my case it is on a separate partition called /dev/sda1

<pre>
$sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot
</pre>

Next you need to bind mount all your devices from USB to the HDD...

<pre>
$sudo mount --bind /dev/ /mnt/dev
</pre>

chroot into your HDD system and fix things...

<pre>
$sudo chroot /mnt
</pre>

now you can run the command grub-install again to install grub to your /dev/sda

<pre>
$sudo grub-install /dev/sda
$sudo grub-install --recheck /dev/sda
</pre>

Hit CTRL+D to get out of the chroot, unmount dirs in LIFO order, /mnt/dev, /mnt/boot and /mnt. reboot the system and you are good to go!

=== Alternative Test ===

If you do not want to install grub2 on your machine but you do want to see if it works with your BIOS, an alternative test is as follows:

* Download the bzip2 compressed image bootable-grub2-2.5GB.img.bz2 from
http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~cking/grub2-boot-tests/bootable-grub2-2.5GB.img.bz2 

* Uncompress it:

<pre>
bunzip2 bootable-grub2-2.5GB.img.bz2
</pre>

* Insert a 4GB or larger USB pen drive into your machine

* Copy the image to the drive.  If it appears as block device /dev/sdz, do the following:

<pre>
sudo dd if=bootable-grub2-2.5GB.img of=/dev/sdz
</pre>
'''WARNING: Make sure you are writing to the correct block device before proceeding!'''

* Boot your machine with this image.  If it boots OK, add your hardware to the list below. Note: This image boots from an ext3 partition.

=== Editing ===

<pre>
nano /boot/grub/grub.cfg   ### Do not edit directly. See /etc/grub.d/
</pre>

=== Results ===

(Please add your machine in the correct alphabetical order)

NOTE: if you only test chainloaded, put UNTESTED in the native column.

=== Comments ===

(AlexeyBalmashnov) Shall there be note on how to put into table Do-It-Yourself system? Like, name it "DIY, MB Producer, MB Model" (Example: DIY Intel DG965WH); Since MB seems to be the most relevant piece of information here?

(Tim Miller Dyck) As of the grub2 package in Ubuntu 9.10 Alpha 4 (1.96+20090725-1ubuntu2), Grub2 does not support booting from software RAID devices with metadata 1.0 or later superblocks. Only the default metadata 0.9 works (see <nowiki>[[http://www.mail-archive.com/linux-raid@vger.kernel.org/msg09618.html]]</nowiki>).
