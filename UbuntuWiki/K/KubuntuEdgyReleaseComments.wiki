== Kubuntu Edgy Release Comments ==

* The upgrade procedure from 6.06 LTS to 6.10 (see http://kubuntu.org/announcements/6.10-release.php) is quite convoluted for a generic user. What about adding a "upgrade your existing/installed kubuntu distro from CD/DVD or network" option to the Adept/Synaptic main menu AND adding a "upgrade your existing/installed kubuntu distro" option to the system menu of the Live CD/DVDs?
 
* Update from Dapper went smoothly for me, but I did a mix between the recommandations from kubuntu and ubuntu wikis : 
 1. download kubuntu-6.10-alternate-i386.iso
 2. deactivated adept_notifier
 3. apt-cdrom add
 4. modified all "dapper" to "edgy" in /etc/apt/sources.list, and removed or commented unneccessary recent entries (KDE 3.5.5, Amarok 1.4.3, etc...) 
 5. sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade  (the second dist-upgrade finalise installation by installing everything needed for boot like upstart). It took me 20 - 30 min.
 6. sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop python-qt3 python-kde3 ubuntu-minimal
 7. reboot
 8. Adept found 35 updates : I had to manually select "Request update" for each
 9. Everything's working fine since that (updates automatically).                                        / Nikoo.Nov 6th 2006

* Awesome! RyanKavanagh

* I updated from Dapper to Edgy RC about a week ago and it didn't go too well. The fact that I used more than just the official repositories could likely have something to do with it though. However, some competent help from #kubuntu got me up and running again :) I had hoped the integrated sd-card reader (Thinkpad z61t) would work with Edgy, but it doesn't (yes, I will file a bug report). I have also had some wireless problems, but I will have to investigate that a bit more. Otherwise I really like the release - nice and polished, keep up the good work! /Pointwood aka Joergen Ramskov

* This upgrade has not gone well for me. It may be because I customize my desktop more, but not an unreasonable amount. x.org wouldn't start until I completely uninstalled X and re-installed, even though apt-get said everything was squared away. usplash doesn't work at all for me -- it just hangs, so I had to disable that. On my kubuntu desktop, it now ignores my preference not to show device icons on the desktop. I don't like how my fonts look now -- they're small and anti-aliasing is way too strong. My konqueror search box, to the right of the URL, vanished. When I was logged in as root trying to fix the usplash problems, I got spurious DCOP and konqueror crashes. Everywhere I turn something is broken. So while I *appreciate* the work you all do very much, I'm unhappy to report that this has been far from a smooth upgrade for me. / Ken

* upgrade from dapper on amd64 failed for me due to unresolvable (at least by me) dependencies for krita-data and arts / Fritz

* When I was installing, I got a lot of packages which didn't set-up properly, and I still have some which haven't now. The packages took ages to set up. When I first rebooted, the X server failed because they were no graphics card modules installed. I had to install these manually with Aptitude. To get wireless working properly, I have to use my old kernel, as the new one just doesn't want to work. Also, scrolling is problematic (in both firefox and konqueror) I can see the screen refreshing. My advice to newbs is do NOT attempt to install as the old saying goes "if it ain't broke, don't fix it", advanced users give it a try, but be prepared for the worst.

* I am upgrading using the instructions on http://kubuntu.org/announcements/6.10-release.php but it's tremendously slow.  Wouldn't it be better for both your servers and our upgrade speed if we upgraded like this?  I'm not sure if it's possible, but if it is, everyone wins:
 1. Download the 6.10 CD over bittorrent (such as '''http://ftp.ussg.iu.edu/linux/ubuntu-releases/kubuntu/edgy/kubuntu-6.10-desktop-i386.iso.torrent''')
 2. Mount the ISO as a drive without burning it to a CD ('''sudo mount -o loop -t iso9660 /home/username/Desktop/kubuntu-6.10-desktop-i386.iso /cdrom''')
 3. Use apt-cdrom on the mount point ('''sudo apt-cdrom -m -d /cdrom add''')
 4. Upgrade following the directions 
Hmmph.  I tried but it doesn't work.  It doesn't think anything needs to be upgraded.  Instructions: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=75885 http://www.svecc.com/ubuntu_upgrade_instructions.htm

* HDA Intel mic does not work (Edgy comes with an old version of ALSA). <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.15/+bug/42600]]</nowiki>

* I did everything the way it is described above. Some installations went wrong. The REBOOT was very final: the system, after initializing, halted. Just like that. I felt very 'edgy' (if not itchy). So I'm reformatting the disk and take a fresh start with 6.10 on CD.
2 days later: I tried Ubuntu, Kubuntu and Xubuntu Install 6.10, everytime with a fresh partition and reformat. Nice it looks, especially Xubuntu which comes with FF2. But everything that has to do with Java is a Disaster: installation is blocked after 4% and that's it. And everything that depends on the presence of Java is blocked too. No codecs or streaming, no embedded video or so.
Compare: with Slax I can at least surf listening to www.smoothjazz.com...
