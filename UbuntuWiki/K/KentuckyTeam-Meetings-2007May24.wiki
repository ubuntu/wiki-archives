<pre>
20:25 <     etank> @startmeeting
20:25 <     etank> oh well
20:25 <     etank> i guess the bot is sick tonight
20:25 <    bkingx> Dead bot
20:25 <    bkingx> Poor dead bot
20:26 <     etank> really i have only two things on the topic list
20:26 <     etank> 1) Web site woes.
20:26 <     etank> 2) Ubuntu US Team meeting coming up.
20:26 <     etank> so to start 
20:27 <     etank> i have been trying to work with the drupal install and theme that is currently running on our site
20:27 <     etank> i think that it looks nice but there is something screwed up with the theme i think
20:27 <    bkingx> It is a little hard to work with.
20:27 <     etank> it messes up when you try to add content
20:28 <      X626> I've noticed problems with some themes.  I've started messing around with Drupal, myself.
20:28 <     etank> i have looked into joomla and wordpress but can not find a real good theme for it
20:28 <     etank> and i suck at making themes
20:28 <     etank> I am to the point now where I dont care if the site looks like the ubuntu home page or not
20:29 <     etank> there are some really nice looking sites out there
20:29              bkingx nods
20:29 <     etank> ubuntu-rs.org, meetlinux.com, etc
20:29 <     etank> do any of you have webdev skills to help make a better looking site?
20:30 <    bkingx> What was the deal with the Russian site?  They won't let us use their theme?
20:30 <      X626> I can't make themes, but I can write modules.
20:30 <     etank> they are using a theme that is not released under an open license
20:30 <     etank> so we can not have it
20:30 <     etank> X626: thats cool.
20:30 <     etank> the thing we really need is the look
20:31              <   klb!i=kevin@buley.org [Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)]
20:31 <    bkingx> The Penn site is pretty clean...I like that.
20:31              <   Ubuntu-Ky!i=kevin@buley.org [Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)]
20:31 <      X626> Unfortunately, when it comes to designing the look, I can't help there...I suck at making themes.
20:32 <    bkingx> I can help with the design: colors, placement, graphics
20:32 <     etank> X626: i know the feeling
20:32 <    bkingx> But we need a basic framework to start with.
20:32 <     etank> bkingx: the Penn site is running wordpress
20:32 <    bkingx> That is where I am lost.
20:32 <    bkingx> Yeah...I'm cool with Wordpress.
20:32 <     etank> this kind of also leads to the second topic
20:33 <     etank> the US Team has just this week created planet.ubuntu-us.org
20:33 <     etank> it is for aggregating approved team blogs
20:33 <     etank> not individual blogs 
20:34 <     etank> I think that we should just use our site as a team blog
20:34 <     etank> and then have a seperate site for stuff like the charity project, etc
20:34 <     etank> you know though if we want to go back to the old theme for drupal we could do that
20:35 <     etank> there seem to be quite a few teams still using that look
20:35 <     etank> and it was a lot easier to work with
20:35 <     etank> http://www.ubuntu-cl.org/ http://www.ubuntu-id.org/ http://www.ubuntu-ve.org/   <--- examples
20:35 <    bkingx> You mean, the original Ubuntu theme?
20:36 <    bkingx> Naw...I think we need to go in a totally different direction.
20:36 <     etank> bkingx: yeah the one that we started with in the first place
20:36              <   jkeyes0!n=jkeyes0@host-067-131-062-080.dhcp.fewpb.net ["Later!"]
20:36 <     etank> but we need to get it working as quick as possible in my opinion
20:37 <    bkingx> Are there other default templates included with Drupal?
20:37              >>> jkeyes0!n=jkeyes0@host-067-131-062-080.dhcp.fewpb.net
20:37 <      X626> There's some included.  I don't remember how many.  I deleted most of them from mine.
20:38 <     etank> bkingx: about 4 or 5
20:38 <     etank> but they are very basic
20:38 <    bkingx> OK...and it looks like there are some more to download off of drupal's site.
20:38 <    bkingx> http://drupal.org/project/Themes
20:38 <     etank> and again we would have to figure out how they work so we can change then
20:38 <     etank> *them
20:39 <    bkingx> Can we look at these and choose one to begin with?  Make that decision tonight.
20:39 <    bkingx> ?
20:39 <     etank> i like this one http://amadou.sp0ke.net/
20:40 <      X626> Yeah, that one looks pretty good.
20:41 <    bkingx> It's OK.  Seems a bit busy to me.
20:41 <     etank> and this one too http://goldenhour.sp0ke.net/
20:43 <    bkingx> better
20:43 <    bkingx> So clarify
20:43 <     etank> those are the only ones that i saw that i really liked
20:44              >>> zenwhen!n=troy@ubuntu/member/zenwhen
20:44 <    bkingx> Drupal is basically a blog publishing site ?
20:44 <     etank> if we want to wait a few i can get them installed on the server so we can see them
20:44 <     etank> drupal is a content management site
20:44 <     etank> cms
20:44 <    bkingx> But from all these, I don't see any content.
20:44 <    bkingx> I think that is my problem.
20:45 <      X626> Aurora is one of my favorites, but I don't know if you all will like it: http://drupal.org/project/aurora
20:45 <    bkingx> It appears to be a blog and links to other sites.
20:46 <      X626> Actually, you can do all sorts of stuff with Drupal, especially with different modules.
20:46 <     etank> X626: is right there
20:46 <     etank> X626: i like that one but the colors are a little off
20:47 <     etank> but i guess we could change the colors if the layout matches what we want
20:47 <      X626> Like I said, I wasn't sure if you'd like it or not.
20:47 <    bkingx> Colors I am good at.  Picking the layout, not so much.
20:47 <     etank> http://kentucky.ubuntu-us.org/
20:48 <     etank> check it out
20:48 <     etank> the header images would have to move but that is the general layout
20:49 <     etank> do a refresh now
20:49 <    bkingx> I think we need to keep the front page relatively static.  Or at least have a small module that shows latest posts or something.
20:49 <     etank> latest posts should not be a problem
20:50 <      X626> The link that has "My Account" and Logout seems to have disappeared on me.
20:50 <    bkingx> To me this doesn't say approved team site.  It says, here is a quick blog to show we exist.
20:50              >>> Ubuntu-Ky!i=kevin@buley.org
20:50 <     etank> you can make a story sticky so that it stays on the front page
20:50 <     etank> bkingx: it is a starting point not a finished thing
20:50 <     etank> alright lets look at the other one
20:51 <     etank> refresh
20:51 <    bkingx> I know...just basic design elements for a web site.
20:51 <     etank> i like the first one better
20:51              >>> klb!i=kevin@buley.org
20:52 <      X626> I do, too.
20:52 <    bkingx> Out of those two, #1 better
20:52 <    bkingx> http://themebot.com/gallery/?g2_itemId=22640
20:53 <     etank> for X626 
20:53 <     etank> refresh again
20:54 <     etank> bkingx: you like that one?
20:54 <    bkingx> Getting better.
20:55 <     etank> i like the one that is on now except for the notebook look to the page
20:55 <      X626> You are going to leave it so that members can choose the theme, aren't you?  I like that feature of Drupal.
20:56 <     etank> bkingx: its up there now check it out
20:56 <    bkingx> etank: exactly my thought.
20:56 <     etank> you like that one the best?
20:56 < XdarkXana> that one is kinda cool. needs different colours though.
20:57 <    bkingx> So far, yes
20:57 <      X626> That one isn't too bad.  I kinda like it.
20:57 <     etank> XdarkXanarchyX: i agree
20:57 <    bkingx> Def needs dif colors.
20:57 <     etank> it is just so narrow
20:57 <     etank> not a lot of room for other content the way it is
20:57 < XdarkXana> Can't you change the width of it?
20:58 < XdarkXana> I know some CSS/HTML if that helps any.
20:58 <      X626> I'd say you can, but I don't know much about Drupal themes.
20:58 <    bkingx> It looks like it was made for 800x600
20:58 <     etank> im sure we can change it some for sure
20:58 <    bkingx> We 'might' be able to resized it.
20:59 <    bkingx> *resize
20:59 <     etank> refresh one more time
20:59 <    bkingx> Color and images aside, do you like this one: http://www.slashcode.com/
21:00 <     etank> bkingx: give me a link to download it and we will check it out for real
21:00 <      X626> That one is kinda nice, too.
21:01 < XdarkXana> I do, the colours are nice too, maybe not for Ubuntu but they do match my desktop!
21:01 <    bkingx> etank: what version?
21:01 <     etank> 5.x
21:01 <     etank> we can always go to an older version of drupal if we need to
21:01 <    bkingx> http://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/drupal/files/projects/slash-5.x-1.x-dev.tar.gz
21:02 <     etank> f5 it guys
21:03 <     etank> that one is not to bad
21:03 <     etank> i like that one and the one before it
21:03 <      X626> I like that one.
21:03 <     etank> on the one before i really liked the space on the right side
21:03 <    bkingx> another one: http://florall.ru/rezina.jpg
21:03              >>> lapjack!i=kevin@buley.org
21:04 <      X626> Wow...a lot of themes.
21:05 <     etank> link to the theme bkingx 
21:05 <    bkingx> http://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/drupal/files/projects/rezina-5.x-1.2.tar.gz
21:07 <    bkingx> This one?
21:07 <    bkingx> http://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/drupal/files/projects/internet_services-5.x-1.1.tar.gz
21:07              >>> Ubuntu-KY-AltNic!i=kevin@buley.org
21:07 <     etank> bkingx: the rezina has an error so we can not see it right now
21:08 <    bkingx> K
21:08 <    bkingx> internet services?
21:08 <     etank> it up
21:08 <     etank> the slash one has 4 themes in it
21:09 <     etank> red, black, blue and green
21:09 <     etank> i like the slash one better so far
21:10 <    bkingx> Slash and this current one are my favs so far.
21:10 <     etank> i dont like the current one myself
21:10 <     etank> i have one 
21:11 <      X626> I don't like the current one, either.
21:11 <     etank> f5
21:11 <    bkingx> OK...slash seems to be the best so far.
21:11 <    bkingx> I say we load that.
21:11 <      X626> Yeah, I like the slash one best.
21:11 <     etank> the one that is up now has two themes
21:11 <     etank> onw wide and one narrow
21:12 <    bkingx> Can you show us the different colors for slash?
21:12 <     etank> which color slash
21:12 <    bkingx> lol
21:12 <     etank> black is up now
21:12 <     etank> blue going up now
21:13 <    bkingx> Blue is noce.
21:13 <    bkingx> *nice!
21:13 <      X626> I didn't llike the black, but the blue is nice.
21:13 <     etank> and now green
21:13 <    bkingx> Not bad either.
21:13 <      X626> I think the green is the worst one.
21:13 <     etank> green looks like the old windows nt colors when your video driver is screwed up bad
21:14 <    bkingx> LOL
21:14 < XdarkXana> haha
21:14 <     etank> green is out
21:14 <    bkingx> Let's go blue
21:14 <    bkingx> It screams KY too, I think
21:14 < XdarkXana> i agree
21:15              X626 agrees
21:15 <     etank> i still like the one that is up there now
21:15 <      X626> I like many of those themes.
21:16 <    bkingx> What's this one called?
21:16 <     etank> the one that is up now (yes i changed it again) is really my favorite of them all
21:16 <     etank> this one is amadou
21:16 <      X626> I don't know which I like the most.
21:16 <     etank> the one before was spread firefox
21:16 <    bkingx> OK...and this one?
21:18 <     etank> this is amadou
21:18 <     etank> i added some stuff to it
21:18 <    bkingx> OK...I like this one too.
21:18 <    bkingx> And much better with the added stuff!!
21:18 <     etank> this is my favorite of them all
21:18 <    bkingx> Yup!
21:18 <     etank> jkeyes0: what are your thoughts
21:18 <     etank> you to klb 
21:18 <    bkingx> @vote
21:18 <      X626> I don't know which I prefer, but I really like the current one.
21:18 < Ubuntu-KY> No vote in progress
21:18 <   jkeyes0> I'm a big fan of blue, but does it really follow the ubuntu theme in general?
21:19 < XdarkXana> It follows Kubuntu..
21:19 <     etank> jkeyes0: we are thinking of moving away from trying to mimic the ubuntu thing
21:19 <     etank> XdarkXanarchyX: good point
21:19              bkingx nods
21:19 <   jkeyes0> ah, I missed that part. :P dad called, then a coworker (setting up his VPN)
21:19              bkingx +1 for the current one (amadou)
21:20              <   klb!i=kevin@buley.org [Nick collision from services.]
21:20 <     etank> [vote] is the current theme the one to go with?
21:20 < Ubuntu-KY> etank, Either there isn't a meeting in progress, or there is already an active vote.
21:20              <   Ubuntu-Ky!i=kevin@buley.org [Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)]
21:20              ~   Ubuntu-KY-AltNic is now Ubuntu-Ky
21:20 <     etank> darn you Ubuntu-Ky 
21:20              >>> klb!i=kevin@buley.org
21:20 <       klb> bloody hell
21:20              jkeyes0 +1 in that case, though I do prefer the menus on the left side
21:20 <     etank> jkeyes0: me too
21:20 <     etank> but i dont know if i can easily change that
21:21 <    bkingx> On the right makes it look different and fresh.
21:21 <      X626> I also prefer them on the left, but I can get used to something new.
21:21              <   lapjack!i=kevin@buley.org [Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)]
21:21 <    bkingx> I think I like it the way it is.
21:21              >>> zenwhen_!n=troy@adsl-074-171-220-223.sip.bgk.bellsouth.net
21:22 <     etank> is this the one to go with then for now?
21:22              etank +1
21:22              bkingx +1
21:22              X626 +1
21:23 < XdarkXana> +1
21:23 <     etank> looks like its a go then
21:23 <    bkingx> ;)
21:23 <     etank> do we want to allow users to change the look like X626 mentioned
21:23 <     etank> or should we lock it in to have consistency
21:24 <    bkingx> I suggest lock it in.
21:25 <      X626> I always like being able to customize stuff, that's the reason I mentioned it.
21:25 <     etank> i think so too
21:26 <      X626> Of course, it doesn't really matter to me.
21:26 <    bkingx> meh...I guess
21:26              >>> jkeyes0_!n=jkeyes0@host-067-131-062-080.dhcp.fewpb.net
21:26 <     etank> so are we are good with this being a team blog thing then
21:26 < XdarkXana> I also like to customize things, that's why I generally use KDE.
21:26              <   jkeyes0!n=jkeyes0@host-067-131-062-080.dhcp.fewpb.net [Nick collision from services.]
21:26              ~   jkeyes0_ is now jkeyes0
21:27 <     etank> so since we are going with this one how do we want to customize it
21:27 <     etank> header, links, ????
21:28 <    bkingx> yup and yup
21:28 <    bkingx> I want to see a calendar link
21:28 <    bkingx> team calendar.  The google thing is OK, but if we can integrate it with the site theme, it will look nice.
21:29 <     etank> oops
21:30              >>> Pat40503!n=patchad@74-131-211-12.dhcp.insightbb.com
21:30 <   jkeyes0> what happened to the site? :P
21:31 <   jkeyes0> ah, back.
21:31 <     etank> deleted the wrong folder
21:31 <     etank> my bad
21:31 <     etank> i was cleaning out the themes that we dont need
21:32 <     etank> bkingx: do you want to see if you can find a nice drupal module for a cal
21:32 <    bkingx> Sure = looking
21:36 <    bkingx> still looking
21:36              <   zenwhen_!n=troy@adsl-074-171-220-223.sip.bgk.bellsouth.net ["Leaving"]

21:37              <   zenwhen!n=troy@ubuntu/member/zenwhen [Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)]
21:37 <     etank> well now we have something to work with at least
21:37 <     etank> we can spend some time making it more Kentucky-ish
21:38 <    bkingx> http://www.elderweb.com/demo/calendar
21:38 <     etank> once we have the look a little more the way we want it then i will send the rss feed to the guys who host the ubuntu-us planet
21:39 <    bkingx> That sounds cool
21:39 <    bkingx> http://drupal.org/project/event
21:39 <    bkingx> better event calendar
21:40 <    bkingx> I still think we need to keep the front page more 'welcome-ish' and have a link to a blog module.
21:42 <     etank> bkingx: http://kentucky.ubuntu-us.org/?q=event/2007/05/24
21:43 <    bkingx> OH HELL YEAH!!
21:43 <    bkingx> That is SEXY!!
21:43 <    bkingx> Say, can the links at the top be organized with drop-downs?
21:44              <   zenwhen_!n=troy@adsl-074-171-220-223.sip.bgk.bellsouth.net ["This computer has gone to sleep"]
21:44 <     etank> bkingx: i think that they can
21:44 <    bkingx> Cool.
21:44 <     etank> should we end the meeting now and just keep working on the site some?
21:44 <    bkingx> Well crap...I was hoping that wouldn't happen.
