__TOC__

Usually you can find the right package in Launchpad by searching for the application.  There is a lot of information about choosing a package at <nowiki>[[Bugs-FindRightPackage|FindRightPackage]]</nowiki>.  Here are some other useful guidelines for KDE components:
* System Settings lives in kdebase-workspace, though is just the shell that gives you icons for the various settings modules.  If you want to file a bug about a settings module, it should probably be against one of ''kdebase'' ''kdeadmin'', or ''kdenetwork''.  Specifically:
** ''knetworkconf'', the manual network configuration module, is in ''kdeadmin''
** The ''filesharing'' module is in ''kdenetwork''
** Most others are in ''kdebase''
* Konqueror, Kate, and Konsole (and more) are in ''kdebase''
* Krunner, klipper, kscreensaver, ksysguard, kwin, and systemsettings are in ''kdebase-workspace''
* Knotify, kio slaves are in ''kdebase-runtime''
* Ark is in ''kdeutils''.
* If you have an issue consistent for all KDE applications, such as not being able to launch them, the problem is likely in ''kdelibs''

For definitive information on what KDE module an application is in, see KDE SVN <nowiki>[[http://websvn.kde.org/branches/KDE/3.5/|for KDE 3.5]]</nowiki> and for <nowiki>[[http://websvn.kde.org/branches/KDE/4.0/|KDE 4.0]]</nowiki>.
