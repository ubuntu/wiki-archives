__TOC__

=== I heard the Kernel Team were asking for testing, where can I find details? ===

The currently open ''Calls for Testing'' are listed on the <nowiki>[[Kernel-Testing]]</nowiki> page.  All open and closed calls should be listed there.  We are obviously most interested in testing on the open calls.
