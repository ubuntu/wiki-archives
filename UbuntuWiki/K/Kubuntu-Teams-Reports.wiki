== Introduction ==
Welcome to the Kubuntu Team's reporting page. Every month this page should be filled with bullet points indicating the summary of some of the work Kubuntu team members have been working on. As members work on something, they should try and summarize their work here. A few guidelines for how to write good points are:

* Keep it simple and short - single sentences are best
* Try to summarize your work and not be over-detailed
* Where possible, include relevant links.

Members should get all reporting added to this page by the end of the 22nd of each month.
