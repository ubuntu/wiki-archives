__TOC__

Here I'd like some guidelines for Kubuntu loco teams.

23:27 <mdke> but where it comes to groups operating forums, documentation, translation etc, collaboration is a must, and collaboration is
             best achieved by having the same group doing both things
23:27 <mdke> that doesn't mean sharing a website, of course. Often different websites will be needed

explain why kubuntu communities will often need their own websites/irc etc

explain why they need to be part of the equivalent ubuntu community
