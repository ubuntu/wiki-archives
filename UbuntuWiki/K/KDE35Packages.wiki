Help make packages for KDE 3.5 beta1

* Make a breezy chroot see DebootstrapChroot

* Install KDE 3.5 beta1 kdelibs and kdebase (ask Riddell for URL)

* Grab a source package for your favourite module (ask Riddell for URL)

* unbzip it, remove debian directory, tar zcf into a .orig file ( fex. kdefoo_x.x.orig.tar.gz )

* grab current sources: mkdir current && cd current && apt-get source kdefoo && cd ..

* copy the debian directory into the new sources

* dch -i  to update the changelog, make sure version number is correct ( use fex. 3.4.91, not 3.5beta1 or something similar )

* test that all the patches apply, patch -p1 < debian/patches/foo, fix those that don't

* Remove unsermake build-dep from debian/control and line from debian/rules

* Make sure the deps in debian/control point to the correct version of kdelibs4-dev

* debuild

* wait

* Make sure it's compiled and fix the debian/*install files, dh_install --list-missing  will tell you what's in the *install files but no longer exists then will tell you what files exist but arn't in the *install files missing 

* debuild -nc  to repackage without cleaning
 
* install the resulting .debs and test

* build for hoary (need a hoary chroot, set version number to -0ubuntu0hoary1)
