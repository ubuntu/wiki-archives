=== Release Meeting Items ===

* In Progress:
** Bug:508516: wakeup from sleep fails on toshiba nb305
** analysis seems to show this is a nasty BIOS bug in SMI handling which has a dependancy on how timers are programmed, there is a work around via command line parameters which is being release noted, work continues on a quirk for this behaviour
** Bug:539467: SATA link power management causes disk errors and corruption
** sata link control is disabled in pmutils in Natty, debugging of the issue with upstream is ongoing; slightly different settings seem to work better (medium power instead of minimum). Likely controller related.  A fix for the Nvidia mcp65 in low power mode is in testing with positive feedback.  As there are other reports of ALPM issues with other controllers we will leave it disabled in pm-utils for Natty 
** Bug:542660: New Apple iMac (Core i5) fails to display anything
** issue remains intractible, more intensive debugging required, this will not be fixed before release, moved out to natty-updates
** Bug:608312: USB host mode on OTG doesn't work on Maverick with BeagleBoard
** possible fix exists, need to understand why this has not been applied
** Bug:625364: lenovo/thinkpad R500/T6x/T400[s]/T500/W500/W700/X60/X200 suspend fails
** this seems to be a bug in KMS, there is a work around via chvt which we could enable through a pm-utils update in the short term, needs investigation
** Bug:634487: t1.micro instance hangs when installing java
** not reproducible in a local test rig, somehow specific to EC2, investigation continues
** Bug:674984: Unable to wake up from suspend on Dell M101z
** there is a possible fix for this in Natty, waiting on testing results
** Bug:686388: [i965gm] GPU lockup - Invalid GTT entry during Display B Fetch
** it seems that these may now be resolved, awaiting testing
** Bug:710738: Regression latest kernel breaks my Atheros AR5001 wifi
** possible work around via disabling hwcrypt, awaiting testing
** Bug:712075: [drm:drm_edid_block_valid] *ERROR* EDID checksum is invalid
** problem remains with the latest kernels, needs investigation
** Bug:719620: Toshiba Tecra A11 - System doesn't resume after suspend
** it is suspected that this is a BIOS issue, attempts to update the BIOS are ongoing
** Bug:746751: kernel: [Firmware Bug]: the BIOS has corrupted hw-PMU resources (MSR 38d is 30)
** it seems that this is currently non-reproducible, monitoring
** Bug:747090: wrong return address sometimes pushed for INT in kvm (not qemu)
** preliminary fix for this is now available, testing shows it is good.  Applied to Natty for the next upload, Fix Committed
** Bug:750649: [Lenovo W510/T410] System is unable to suspend
** testing with the Nvidia drivers has been requested, and we await the results
** Bug:753071: Include DRM OMAP driver to have proper EDID detection
** there is a huge patchset for this issue, it is likely too high risk to take before release
* Closed
** Bug:720949: Dell Wireless 1702 dual wifi/bluetooth: bluetooth not detected
** is now Fix Released
** Bug:731878: shutdown(2) behavior changed in kernel
** is now Fix Released

=== Items pushed out from natty final ===
* '''POSTPONED''' none-kernel-n-misc -- LP: 344878 : file name too long when creating new file (ecryptfs_lookup: lookup_one_len() returned [-36] on lower_dentry) (linux)

=== Items pushed out from natty-beta-1 ===

* '''POSTPONED''' hardware-kernel-n-ubuntu-delta-review -- compcache: compressed memory swap support -- confirm if this is needed or update to latest version

* '''SLIPPED''' hardware-kernel-n-config-review -- LP: 632327 : Powertop suggests CONFIG_PM_ADVANCED_DEBUG kernel option (linux)
** unsure as to the possible negative impacts of enabling this, needs review

* '''SLIPPED''' hardware-kernel-n-version-and-flavours -- document how to build a new derivative flavour/branch
** non release critical documentation task

=== Items pushed out from natty-alpha-3 ===

* '''SLIPPED''' hardware-kernel-n-config-review -- LP: 632327 : Powertop suggests CONFIG_PM_ADVANCED_DEBUG kernel option (linux)
** unsure as to the possible negative impacts of enabling this, needs review

* '''SLIPPED''' hardware-kernel-n-ubuntu-delta-review -- compcache: compressed memory swap support -- confirm if this is needed or update to latest version
** prototype exists but not yet tested in the CD environment

* '''SLIPPED''' hardware-kernel-n-version-and-flavours -- document how to build a new derivative flavour/branch
** non release critical documentation task

=== Items pushed out from natty-alpha-2 ===

* none-kernel-n-misc -- LP: 344878 : file name too long when creating new file (ecryptfs_lookup: lookup_one_len() returned [-36] on lower_dentry) (linux)
** a prototype is close to ready, but this is not going to be ready for natty-alpha-2, we will need to decide shortly if we are going to disable this for natty-alpha-3.

* hardware-kernel-n-ubuntu-delta-review -- compcache: compressed memory swap support -- confirm if this is needed or update to latest version
** this will need some installer work, will revisit early after the natty-alpha-2 releases.

* '''SLIPPED''' hardware-kernel-n-version-and-flavours -- document how to build a new derivative flavour/branch
** non release critical documentation task

=== Items pushed out from natty-alpha-1 ===

* '''SLIPPED''' hardware-kernel-n-version-and-flavours -- document how to build a new derivative flavour/branch
* '''DONE''' hardware-kernel-n-version-and-flavours -- document officially supported flavours on a per release basis and who is responsible for those (eg ti etc)
** non release critical documentation task

* '''DONE''' hardware-kernel-n-version-and-flavours -- to swap in a Linaro kernel into an existing CD image confirm feature set
* '''DONE''' hardware-kernel-n-version-and-flavours -- follow up on omap3 discussion and record actual commitment from linaro
** these are dependent on both the linaro touch testing (which has only just been completed) and on having working ARM images which are not going to be completed till after the natty-alpha-1 freeze, pushing out to early natty-alpha-2
** the distro kernel is now producing ARM kernels which appear to be working for the ARM images, therefore closing these out

* '''DONE''' hardware-kernel-n-version-and-flavours -- determine if we really need 3 powerpc flavours (powerpc, powerpc-smp, powerpc64-smp)
** background has been examined but no conclusions drawn at yet, not critical for the natty-alpha-1 milestone
** determined that we do require all of the current flavours, task completed

* '''DONE''' hardware-kernel-n-ubuntu-delta-review -- [jk-ozlabs] Review and report back to platform if there are any specific OEM patches or drivers which we need to carry
* '''DONE''' hardware-kernel-n-ubuntu-delta-review -- [amitk] Review personal ubuntu patches upstreaming and update Spec
* '''DONE''' hardware-kernel-n-ubuntu-delta-review -- [jk-ozlabs] Review Arjan's ubuntu patches for upstreaming and update Spec
* '''DONE''' hardware-kernel-n-ubuntu-delta-review -- [eric.y.miao] Review personal ubuntu patches for upstreaming and update Spec
* '''DONE''' hardware-kernel-n-ubuntu-delta-review -- [lag] Review personal ubuntu patches for upstreaming and update Spec
* '''DONE''' hardware-kernel-n-ubuntu-delta-review -- [manjo] Review personal ubuntu patches for upstreaming and update Spec
** none of the above are critical for the natty-alpha-1 milestone

* '''DONE''' hardware-kernel-n-stable-process-review -- HW Cert team - provide a description of what testing they provide, and an idea of the number of hours required to run those
* '''DONE''' hardware-kernel-n-stable-process-review -- to investigate which systems are "common" for cert testing
* '''DONE''' hardware-kernel-n-stable-process-review -- blueprint for cert-team
** non release critical documentation tasks

* '''DONE''' hardware-kernel-n-stable-process-review -- look at arsenal scripts to nag the users
** non release critical, in progress
