__TOC__

This is a very preliminary list of areas in Kubuntu that are able to be themed or skinned, in order to enhance the overall look and feel as well as give a more overall polished and consistent look.

This is '''''not'''''  for deciding what the actual colors, windeco, style, or icons should be, just what areas are available at this point.
