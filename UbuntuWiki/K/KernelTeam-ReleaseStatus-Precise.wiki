=== What was done engineering wise? ===
We are currently frozen and have made no uploads for the main distro kernel this week.  We did however perform an upload for linux-ti-omap4-3.2.0-1412.16 to resolve Bug:984180.  We have pulled in the latest upstream stable Linux v3.2.15 patches and are queuing them as an SRU for Precise.  We are also queuing some bug fixes which we intend to release as a day-0 kernel upload.  Should we need an upload between now and final release, we would like to have these pending fixes included.  We'll address these specifically with the release team should the opportunity present itself.  All of our work items are now closed for Precise 12.04.

=== What's about to land that might impact the other teams? ===
We have a day-0 kernel upload planned.  We intend to upload this to precise-proposed on Tues Apr 24.

=== Release Notes ===
