__TOC__

My name is Ketil Thorgersen and I have been using linux in different flavours for about 10 years. My main occupation is music education... Writing a PhD at the moment - 

Anyway: Helping out with bugreporting and having made a wiki page for asus A9RP is my small contribution to the great efforts of Ubuntu - The absolutely best distro!
