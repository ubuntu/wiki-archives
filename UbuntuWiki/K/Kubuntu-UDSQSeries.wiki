__TOC__

Everyone who plans to attend either in person or remotely should add their name to the appropriate list, so we know who of Kubuntu will be joining us. Spec ideas go into the ideas selection and if sufficient content/importance they will be turned into actual Launchpad blueprints in due time. Every spec should have at least one session lead, if the lead is not present in person a "proxy" should be selected and brought up to speed on the topic to act as hand of the lead (sounds all professional, doesn't it \o/).

==== On-Site ====
* David Wonderly
* Alex Fiestas
* Dario Freddi
