__TOC__

I'm currently a student at Bucknell University pursuing a degree in Computer Science. I submitted and/or confirmed a few bug reports, and this page seems to have been created as a result. I figured I'd put something in it. Having now done this, I am now going back to whatever I was doing previously.

You could visit my blog, but there isn't much to it.
