20:10 <     etank> who would be willing to do a presentation?
20:10              >>> bkingx!n=bkingx@mail.hsgworld.com
20:11 <     etank> !hi | bkingx 
20:11 <    ubotwo> bkingx: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu-kentucky!

20:11 <     etank> I am willing to do some presentations
20:11 <    bkingx> Present away, dude!
20:11 <  EvilGold> what kind of presentations?
20:12 <     etank> bonbonthejon: we were planning to do a dry run on March 24th
20:12 <     etank> but that may have to change since venomous will be out of town 
20:12              >>> comfurtn!n=kyle@mrtcdsl-018.mis.net
20:12 <     etank> for the live event we have not decided yet
20:12 <  comfurtn> hey guys...
20:12 <     etank> EvilGold: something showing to uses and benefits of Ubuntu
20:13 <     etank> Zuph said that he would be willing to do one on server installs
20:13              >>> zenwhen!n=troy@74-131-20-53.dhcp.insightbb.com
20:13 <     etank> !hi | zenwhen 
20:13 <    ubotwo> zenwhen: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu-kentucky!
20:13 <     etank> !hi | comfurtn 
20:13 <    ubotwo> comfurtn: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu-kentucky!
20:13 <     etank> I was thinking that we are going to have new users there who may have never seen Linux before
20:14 <     etank> we can do a presentation on how to do some task and then once their system is installed we help them do it
20:14 <     etank> so that way they have seen it and also done it
20:14 <     etank> that way the process is reinforced
20:15 <    bkingx> Yup
20:15 <     etank> if we are going to have some presentatios then we will need people to write them and then some to do the presentation
20:15 <     etank> if you are a good writer but not a speaker then someone else can do the talking
20:16 <  comfurtn> i'm a good writer, and am willing to help with anything,.
20:16 <     etank> it would be good to have them done before the dry run so that way we can give some polish to them if needed
20:16 <     etank> comfurtn: cool
20:16 <  EvilGold> well i could defiantly write somthing
20:16 <     etank> we need to come up with a topic list so we know what we need to be writing
20:16 <  EvilGold> i write about linux stuff all the time
20:17 <  comfurtn> etank: definitely.
20:17 <  comfurtn> wiki page?
20:17 <     etank> im thinking doing it in OpenOffice Impress
20:17 <  comfurtn> i meant the topic list.
20:17 <     etank> then we can use a projector
20:18 <     etank> aaah
20:18 <     etank> sure that sounds good
20:18 <  comfurtn> ;)
20:18 <     etank> we need to do it kind of quick though
20:19 <     etank> who would be willing to write something?
20:19 <  comfurtn> count me in.
20:19 <  EvilGold> me 2
20:19              etank is working on something now
20:19 <      tekk> well what else would you all need done if someone didn't want to write
20:20 <     etank> we will need to have members there to help the new users do the installs
20:20 <      tekk> yeah
20:20 <  comfurtn> so what's the latest on the previously scheduling march 24th event?
20:20 <  comfurtn> sorry, i was late getting here..
20:20 <     etank> I have never done a install fest before so this is all new to me
20:20 <     etank> any ideas are good
20:21 <      tekk> i'll try to help with ideas
20:21 <     etank> we need to either move the location or the date because venomous is out of town
20:21 <     etank> or will be then
20:21 <     etank> jkeyes0: you got any ideas?
20:22 <   jkeyes0> ideas for presentations?
20:22 <  EvilGold> how many new users are we expecting?
20:22 <     etank> anyting :)
20:22 <     etank> EvilGold: that is a good question
20:22 <  venomous> before is ok, but after would work out a little better.....
20:22 <   jkeyes0> I can almost certainly get us a projector.
20:22 <  venomous> sorry 'bout the lag time tonight!!
20:22 <  EvilGold> and how are we getting them to come? just friends and co workers?
20:22 <     etank> how do we advertise this so that users come
20:22              etank is too slow tonight
20:23 < bonbonthe> where is this, just curious
20:23 <     etank> not set yet
20:23 <    bkingx> so is bkingx
20:23 <     etank> we are hoping on getting a spot at UK but that has not been set yet
20:23 <  EvilGold> If anyone wants to make flyers, i live right behind best buy, so i could give them out easily
20:24 <  comfurtn> etank: i have to be at UK on the 24th, so that would be AWESOME!
20:24 <     etank> i asked on the loco mailing list if any other team already had flyers made but i have not heard much back yet
20:24 <  EvilGold> unfortunately i lack the artistic ability to make anything decent myself
20:25 <     etank> the 24th was to be the dry run for just members so that we could meet each other and do a run through of what we are going to do at the live event
20:25 <     etank> the live even would be late April i think
20:25              >>> XdarkXanarchyX!n=XdarkXan@74-131-216-19.dhcp.insightbb.com
20:25 <    bkingx> I can do some of that stuff, but I will need some ideaz
20:25 < XdarkXana> Hello
20:25 <     etank> !hi | XdarkXanarchyX 
20:25 <    ubotwo> XdarkXanarchyX: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu-kentucky!
20:25 <     etank> XdarkXanarchyX: said that he could do some graphic stuff i think
20:26 <    bkingx> Yep...I heard that too.
20:26 < XdarkXana> Yeah, I'll give it a shot
20:26 <     etank> we need some neat looking flyers to attract people to come to the install fest
20:26 < XdarkXana> But I just lost my main /storage directory today somehow... I'm about to work on recovering it...
20:27 <    bkingx> NP...I'll work on throwing something together.
20:28 <     etank> what is a good date for the live event and also the dry run
20:28 <     etank> how about march 31st for the dry run?
20:28 <    bkingx> Hmm...going on vac that day
20:28 <    bkingx> Spring break
20:29 <     etank> crap
20:29 <     etank> any other ideas then
20:29 <    bkingx> But you guys can still hold it.
20:29 <    bkingx> The 24th was out, right?
20:30 <     etank> venomous can not be there
20:30 <    bkingx> Right
20:30 <    bkingx> Hmm....weeknight?
20:30 <     etank> may not be enough time
20:30 <  EvilGold> I think somthing like this for a flyer would be good:
20:30 <  EvilGold> http://eckenrodehouse.net/kubuntu/flyer1-1.pdf
20:31 <  EvilGold> just simple 1 page layout
20:31 <     etank> did you do that?
20:31 < XdarkXana> I agree.
20:31 <  EvilGold> no
20:32 <     etank> that is sweet
20:32 <  EvilGold> if i didnt i would just say use it
20:32 <    bkingx> nice!!
20:32 <     etank> something like that would be very nice indeed
20:32 <  EvilGold> I'm googling around for ideas
20:33 <    bkingx> We need to consider cost on this.
20:33 <     etank> FREE
20:33 <    bkingx> Color is def more expensive.
20:33 <     etank> just like the os
20:33 <     etank> you mean printing
20:33 <     etank> i thought you meant for the event
20:33 <     etank> sorry
20:33 <    bkingx> Right
20:33 <    bkingx> Printing
20:34 < XdarkXana> I think it's like 15cents at the library per page. or 10cents for non-colour
20:34 <   jkeyes0> off the record, I might be able to do some printing after-hours at work. we have color laser copiers.                       *cough*I'm the administrator*cough*
20:34 <     etank> does anyone have a blog that they can post to?
20:34 < XdarkXana> (that's what I'd be doing, I don't have a printer of my own yet)
20:34 < XdarkXana> lol
20:34 <     etank> would it even help
20:34              <   venomous!i=ven0m0us@gateway/tor/x-709d5737282b2193 [Remote closed the connection]
20:34 <   jkeyes0> someone post it to Digg with Ubuntu in the title. it'll be on the front page in 5 minutes.
20:35 <     etank> EvilGold: did that site have an svg of the flyer?
20:36 <  EvilGold> let me check
20:36 <     etank> should we move to the next topic?
20:37 <    bkingx> sure
20:37 <  EvilGold> well there is a 14mb flyer.tar.gz
20:37 <  EvilGold> i'll see what it is in a min here
20:38 <     etank> next topic: Release Party
20:38 <     etank> the date for that is April 20th but the location is not set
20:38 < XdarkXana> On 4/20?
20:39 <    bkingx> This is basically a social gathering, right?
20:39 <     etank> XdarkXanarchyX: yep
20:39 <     etank> bkingx: yes
20:39 < bonbonthe> is there going to be one big party or a few small ones
20:39 <     etank> just a time to get together and celebrate Ubuntu
20:40 <     etank> bonbonthejon: i asked that on the forums and someone said that we could do it in one location
20:40 <    bkingx> Cool....I suggest some food/drink location.
20:40 <    bkingx> Could, or should, etank ?
20:40 < XdarkXana> I can talk to my job about it, I work at Hardee's.
20:40 <     etank> someone suggested Panera Bread because of the food and free wifi
20:41 <      tekk> what Hardee's ??
20:41 <     etank> im good with anything really
20:41 < XdarkXana> The one in Lexington, on Richmond Road.
20:41 < bonbonthe> what city works the best
20:41 <  EvilGold> I think someplace with WiFI is best
20:41 <    bkingx> If we are talking Lex, there are quite a few joints.
20:41 <     etank> if we do regional the thought was one in Louisville and one in Lexington
20:41 <      tekk> w0rd i got to that one for lunch maybe once a month
20:42 <      tekk> if i run in to ya i'll be like wuzzz up
20:42 < XdarkXana> haha. I work 3rd shift and sometimes get stuck until lunch starts. i'm a manager, used to be in the back though
20:42 <      tekk> oh damn 3rd shift
20:42 <      tekk> nevermind.
20:42 <      tekk> HAHA
20:42 <     etank> there are 40 team members according to the LP site. How many do you think will show up.
20:42 <    bkingx> 3rd shift at Hardees is ROUGH!
20:43 <    bkingx> VERY busy!
20:43 <    bkingx> I say 25%
20:43 <    bkingx> about 10
20:43 <      tekk> we are going to be hiring IT people where i work i can maybe get you people in lexington a job interview
20:43 <  EvilGold> if anyones interested in that flyer's source code its here:
20:43 <  EvilGold> http://eckenrodehouse.net/kubuntu/ubucon_flyer.tar.gz
20:44 <    bkingx> Where is that tekk?
20:44 <      tekk> IF some of you are looking for better work or what not
20:44 <      tekk> EAS, Inc.
20:44 <      tekk> on E. Rynolds Rd.
20:44 <  EvilGold> I'm looking for any work right now
20:44 <    bkingx> EAS?
20:44 <     etank> side note: dude i need a new job BAD
20:44 <      tekk> Expungement Assistance Services
20:45 <     etank> back to the topic at hand
20:45 <      tekk> it will pay at least $11 an hour starting out
20:45 <      tekk> just because it entry level almost
20:45 <     etank> what do we want to do at the party
20:46 <  EvilGold> tekk will you stay around after the meet to discuss that
20:46 <    bkingx> Eat Drink and be Merry!
20:46 <     etank> im thinking eat and talk and that is about it
20:46 <      tekk> indeed i shall
20:46 < XdarkXana> eat
20:46 <    bkingx> etank: agreed
20:46 <   jkeyes0> you wouldn't want to come back to the state, would you etank ?
20:46 <     etank> nothing real technical
20:46 <  EvilGold> I think we should all throw in for a stripper
20:46 <  EvilGold> :-P
20:46 <    bkingx> Joe B's os good.
20:46 <     etank> jkeyes0: maybe
20:46 < XdarkXana> lol
20:46              <   zenwhen!n=troy@ubuntu/member/zenwhen [Read error: 54 (Connection reset by peer)]
20:46 <   jkeyes0> probably not high enough pay for you, honestly.
20:46              >>> zenwhen!n=troy@74-131-20-53.dhcp.insightbb.com
20:46              >>> venomous!i=ven0m0us@gateway/tor/x-47a19326373d1f98
20:47 <     etank> should we do a poster to advertise this too?
20:47 <    bkingx> Joseph Beth.
20:47 <      tekk> where i work we all are about to get paid ALOT more
20:47 <     etank> we may want to get with whatever location it is and let them know
20:48 <    bkingx> Naw...etank
20:48 <      tekk> it's a 2 year old company
20:48 <      tekk> i'll brb all
20:48 <    bkingx> I think we can keep it within our team
20:48 <      tekk> leave me a message if you need me
20:48 <    bkingx> For the Release party anyway
20:48 <     etank> i dont know
20:48 <    bkingx> No?
20:48 <     etank> i think that we should open it up to anyone that is interested
20:48 <  EvilGold> Were doing the install fest after the release party rent we?
20:48 <     etank> yes
20:49 <   jkeyes0> release party being open could lead to more people coming to the install fest.
20:49 <  EvilGold> I think we should just do the release party someplace public, and we'll hopefully meet some new people to invite to the IF
20:49 <     etank> release party first then later in the month install fest
20:49 <     etank> EvilGold: good idea
20:49 <  EvilGold> hopefully we can have flyers ready by then
20:50 <     etank> we can post it on the wiki too at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FeistyReleaseParties
20:51 <    bkingx> Good enough for me!
20:51 <     etank> once we have something firmed up that is
20:52 <    bkingx> SO back to location
20:52              <   zenwhen!n=troy@ubuntu/member/zenwhen []
20:52 <    bkingx> Have we settled on Lexington?
20:53 <  comfurtn> lexington is most convenient for me.
20:53 <  EvilGold> same here
20:53 <     etank> im good with that (but then i live here)
20:53 < XdarkXana> me too.
20:53 < bonbonthe> seems central enough
20:54 <     etank> so how about a location?
20:54 <    bkingx> I think that is the plan then...lexington.
20:54 <  EvilGold> well what places do we know of that have free wifi
20:54 <    bkingx> Now, how about Joseph Beths?
20:54 <     etank> Panera
20:54 <     etank> Fazolis
20:54 < bonbonthe> i think panera or some coffee shop with wifi
20:54 <    bkingx> Cici's
20:55              >>> zenwhen!n=troy@74-131-20-53.dhcp.insightbb.com
20:55              etank thinks that Coffee is good
20:55              >>> dad_e_man!n=sammy@24-151-228-128.dhcp.kgpt.tn.charter.com
20:55 < dad_e_man> missed it didn't I?
20:55 <     etank> zenwhen: what is the name of the coffee shop that you go to?
20:55 <    bkingx> nope,, dad_e_man

20:55 <    bkingx> Welcome back!
20:55 < dad_e_man> cool cool

20:57 <     etank> zenwhen: we are talking about some place for a release party
20:57 <   zenwhen> oh nice

20:57 <   zenwhen> it would be a nice reason to get together
20:58 <  comfurtn> what is third street stuff near?  (non-lexington resident here)
20:58 <     etank> we are talking about doing this on April 20th
20:59 < XdarkXana> I have no idea where anything is.
20:59 <     etank> so would everyone be good with that as a location?
20:59 <     etank> i have never been there before
21:00 <   jkeyes0> works for me. coffeeshops are great for discussions
21:00 <   jkeyes0> never been there though
21:00 <   zenwhen> I am the only person here who has been to it, but I can assure you it does not suck
21:00 <     etank> how about a vote for that as the location
21:01 <   zenwhen> +1
21:01 <   zenwhen> lol
21:01              etank +1

21:03 < XdarkXana> +1
21:03 <     etank> and he is gone again :(
21:03 <     etank> so there we go then
21:03 <     etank> we have a place and a date
21:03 <     etank> what about a time?
21:04              >>> zenwhen!n=troy@74-131-20-53.dhcp.insightbb.com
21:04 <     etank> wb zenwhen 
21:04 <    bkingx> Yeah...that looks like it is it.
21:04 < XdarkXana> I probably have to go into work at 23:00 so any time before that would be good for me.
21:05 <     etank> i was thinking more like 15:00 or 16:00
21:05 <    bkingx> On a Frid?
21:05 < XdarkXana> I think 16:00 would be great.
21:05 <   zenwhen> Had to switch over to my big lcd
21:06 <     etank> no should be Saturday
21:06 <    bkingx> I think the 20th is a Friday.
21:06 <    bkingx> 21st is Saturday.
21:06 <     etank> make that April 21st then
21:06 <   zenwhen> that should work
21:07 <    bkingx> OK...4/21 @ 16:00?
21:07 <   zenwhen> All of my plans are sort of "hit and miss" right now, since I am house shopping
21:07 <     etank> April 21st at 16:00 at Third Street 
21:07 <    bkingx> I was hoping/thinking a bit later, but whatever is the most popular
21:08 <     etank> bkingx: what time were you thinking?
21:08 <    bkingx> maybe 1900
21:08 < XdarkXana> How long is this supposed to go on for?
21:08 <   zenwhen> the place will be much less busy with regulars if we do it earlier
21:08 <     etank> maybe 1.5 to 2 hours
21:08 <    bkingx> I wouldn't think more than an hour or so.
21:08 <   zenwhen> I go in there before the date and see if I can set aside some seating
21:08 < XdarkXana> An hour goes by very fast I think.
21:08 <     etank> like 16:00 - 18:00
21:09 <     etank> zenwhen: that would be great
21:09 <   zenwhen> I know some activist groups have meetings there when i am in there, and they have a large seeting arangment, so I think it is very possible
21:09 <   zenwhen> seating*
21:10 <    bkingx> OK...sounds like a good plan then!
21:11 <   zenwhen> 16:00 then?
21:12 <     etank> works for me
21:12 <     etank> vote for 16:00
21:12              etank +1
21:12 <  comfurtn> +1
21:12 < XdarkXana> :+1

21:14              bkingx +1
21:14 <     etank> so it is set
21:14 <    bkingx> Yep!

21:14 <     etank> s/them/then
21:15 <     etank> I will add it to the wiki

21:15 <     etank> and work on the presentations
