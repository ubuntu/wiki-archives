__TOC__

Without having terribly much of interest to say about myself, I am 28 years old, born and raised in Louisiana (you know, the state at the bottom of all the good lists and top of all the bad ones). I have a Bachelor of Arts degree in multimedia with a concentration in graphic design. I am married to a wonderful woman who does a remarkable job putting up with me, and have a baby boy due in March '08. At 17 I was diagnosed with diabetes, and have dealt with the wonders of insulin and syringes since.

I am currently employed as an Operations Manager at a small electric utility safety training and standards advocacy firm here in Louisiana. I'm an advocate of developing with open standards. The web should be open, and information should be freely accessible. No one company should ever have the right to lock consumers into a proprietary way of interpreting information. Period.
