__TOC__


For the kernel packages themselves, please use the appropriate git scripts, as detailed in KernelMaintenance.  For linux-restricted-modules:

* New orig.tar.gz causes the "Release" to bump, but not the ABI.  This also resets the "Revision":

 <code>2.6.M.REL-ABI.REV</code> -> <code>2.6.M.(REL+1)-ABI.1</code>

* Changes to packaging causes a "Revision" bump, but not "Release" or ABI:

 <code>2.6.M.REL-ABI.REV</code> -> <code>2.6.M.REL-ABI.(REV+1)</code>

* ABI bumps requires a "Revision" bump, but leaves "Release" unchanged:

 <code>2.6.M.REL-ABI.REV</code> -> <code>2.6.M.REL-(ABI+1).(REV+1)</code>

Note: In the rare event that a queued package fails to build, you must bump the version number in debian/changelog before re-queuing.
