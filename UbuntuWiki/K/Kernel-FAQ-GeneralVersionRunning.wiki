=== How can we determine the version of the running kernel? ===

The official version of an Ubuntu kernel is found in the <code>/proc/version_signature</code> file.  This file contains both the full Ubuntu version of the kernel and the mainline version on which it is based.  The first field is always <code>Ubuntu</code>, the second field is the Ubuntu kernel version, and the final field is the upstream version:

    <pre>
$ cat /proc/version_signature
Ubuntu 2.6.35-6.9-generic 2.6.35-rc3
$
</pre>
