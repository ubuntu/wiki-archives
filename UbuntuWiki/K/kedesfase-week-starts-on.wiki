__TOC__

There is one anoying thing in the clock applet that i want to view in other way. Thing is that weeks can't start on monday (as in Europe) and allways shows the calendar with american format (week start on sunday).

Will be great if this feature can be implemented, as in evolution for example, where there is a list when ask the user for the first day of the week.

In the following image there is an screenshot of evolution calendar option for confure the first day of the week.
