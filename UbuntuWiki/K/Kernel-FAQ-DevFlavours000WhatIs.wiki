=== What is a Kernel Flavour? ===

It is impossible to build a single kernel for every occasion, any such configuration cannot be optimal for all use cases.  As a result we offer a number of kernel variants for each release, these variants termed ''flavours''.  We commonly refer to those flavours using the flavour name, for example: ''generic'', ''generic-pae'', and ''server''.
