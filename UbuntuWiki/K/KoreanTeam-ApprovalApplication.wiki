The Ubuntu Korean LoCo Team is a very active, fast growing group of people that supports and spreads Ubuntu amongst the Korean speaking community. It provides the most valuable and vital information on Ubuntu in the Korean language. 

The Ubuntu Korean LoCo Team is composed of many people with diverse backgrounds and focusing on promoting the use of Ubuntu Linux and the free software philosophy in general. The team is shaping a set of projects that will be assigned to individual workgroups in the near future.
