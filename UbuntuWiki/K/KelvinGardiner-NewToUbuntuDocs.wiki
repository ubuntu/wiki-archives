=== Overview ===

This page outlines ideas for revising the "New to Ubuntu" pages of the system documents, which where noted as needing revision during discussions for the new <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Specs/KarmicInstallationGuide | Install Guide for Karmic]]</nowiki>. Initial discussion of these revisions took place on the mailing list, and are available <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-doc/2009-May/013011.html | here]]</nowiki>.

=== Basic Principles ===

* Link to existing docs where possible.
* Improve existing docs before creating new ones.
* Don't cover topics in the new install guide.
* Write something useful for new users.

=== Proposed revised structure ===

Key
* Sections marked with a + are new sections.
* Sections marked with a * are link to other documents.
* Sections marked with a = are existing docs unchanged or up stream docs.
* Sections marked with a > are sections to be revised.
