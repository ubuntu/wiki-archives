=== What is a LoCo Team? ===
''A LoCo Team is a Local Community of (in our case) Ubuntu users. A LoCo can involve a lot of things such as local promoting, support in the local language, general support to local users and much more. Most importantly however, it lets people find other Ubuntu users near them.''

Basically our team consists of Ubuntu (and other Linux distros) users in Kentucky. 
=== How do I join? ===
If you would like to join the team them click <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-kentucky|Join Team]]</nowiki>. On the page you should see a link labeled "Join Team" . You will need to set up a Launchpad user account if you do not already have one. 

We encourage all members of the team to be involved where they can. Involvement can be in advocacy in your local area, wiki contributions, user help on the forums, etc. We also encourage members to be involved in the irc channel and subscribers to the mailing list.
