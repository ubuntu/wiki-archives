Members of this team are inducted only after a careful application and screening process.  The sections below describe the general member profile of the ubuntu-kernel-uploaders team and the application and screening process.

As alluded to in the member profile above, membership consideration for the ubuntu-kernel-uploaders team adheres to a strict policy.  Anyone considering applying should meet '''all''' of the criteria listed below:

# Have a history of substantial and direct contribution to the distribution; particularly the kernel related packages
# A thorough understanding of the Ubuntu kernel patch submission process
## Demonstrates an understanding of this process by having submitted multiple patches which were accepted over a six-month development cycle
## Demonstrates an understanding of this process by having reviewed and Ack'd/Nack'd multiple patches over a six-month development cycle
# A thorough understanding of the Ubuntu release cycle and associated milestone and freeze dates
# A thorough understanding of the Ubuntu Kernel SRU cadence
# A thorough understanding of the upstream kernel development cycle and how it relates to the Ubuntu kernel development cycle
# Demonstrate a chain of trust by having multiple sponsored kernel uploads over a six-month development cycle by various existing members of the ubuntu-kernel-uploaders team.

If you are not an official ubuntu-kernel-uploaders member yet, but fulfill all of the criteria above, you are likely a promising candidate for joining the team.  If you are interested in joining, please start by preparing your application.  Please use the following template for your application:

https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/Dev/PPUApplicationTemplate

An example application can also be seen at the following:

https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LuisHenriques/PerPackageUploaderApplication

At least three existing ubuntu-kernel-uploaders members have to confirm that they have worked enough with you to judge your skills and that you meet the criteria above. Usually these three people are your sponsors.

=== Screening Process ===
Once your application has been prepared and you are ready to be screened, please send an email to the <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/kernel-team|Ubuntu kernel-team mailing list]]</nowiki> requesting your application be reviewed. You will then get a notification from the team about the scheduled Matrix meeting (#kernel:ubuntu.com) where you will be interviewed and a vote regarding your membership will be taken. As part of the interview you will be asked to briefly introduce yourself, so please prepare a 2-3 line introduction beforehand to speed up the process. Only existing members of the ubuntu-kernel-uploaders team are allowed to vote.  An applicant must receive a minimum of 3 Ack's in order to be added to the team.

Once an applicant has successfully passed the application process, an announcement will be made to both the <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/kernel-team|Ubuntu kernel-team]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/devel-permissions|devel-permissions]]</nowiki> mailing lists.  The applicant will then be added to the ubuntu-kernel-uploaders team by an administrator.
