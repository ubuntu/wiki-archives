2010-09-21 16:54:25	etank	Hi all. As a team we have been working to communicat about the existance of Linux our local area about the existance of Linux. We have done this through having regular meetings that are open to the public. Our goal is to have beginner level information at each meeting so that we do not talk over anyones head. At the same time we try to have some more advanced topics so the members that have been

2010-09-21 16:55:05	etank	should have used the spell check in gedit for that :)

2010-09-21 16:55:32	@popey	thanks :)
2010-09-21 16:55:58	@popey	Would it be fair to say you're more a LUG than a LoCo?
2010-09-21 16:56:25	etank	i think so
2010-09-21 16:56:27	 *	volci is here from kentucky
2010-09-21 16:56:44	jfalco	Well kinda of, we've merged the LoCo into the lug to ease the admin duties
2010-09-21 16:57:12	jkeyes0	in the beginning, a majority of our users were using Ubuntu only, but as we've grown, a lot of members use other distros, and we don't want to exclude anyone.
2010-09-21 16:57:31	etank	we are focused on spreading Linux and the resources that the LoCo provides us helps that effort a great deal
2010-09-21 17:00:43	@itnet7	Does your team do team reports? and archive minutes of LoCo IRC meetings?
2010-09-21 17:00:44	etank	we spoke to paultag (think that is his proper nick) about being a lug before applying again
2010-09-21 17:00:55	etank	we do archive our meeting logs
2010-09-21 17:01:05	etank	but we have not done team reports

2010-09-21 17:02:38	etank	and some of our old meeting logs are on the ubuntu wiki (or should be)

2010-09-21 17:04:28	@itnet7	it's the s in https I believe that causes you to require the square bracket LINK
2010-09-21 17:04:30	etank	we normally have 1 or 2 irc meetings each month as well
2010-09-21 17:05:18	@itnet7	I would like to see all of you put a little more effort into Team Reports. It's important to share with the rest of the community what you are doing
2010-09-21 17:05:50	@itnet7	It doesn't take that long, and I would be happy to help you set up an easy way to manage it thanks to nhandler !

2010-09-21 17:06:33	@itnet7	etank: it is part of the wiki
2010-09-21 17:06:57	etank	itnet7: so after regular meetings just update a Team Report?
