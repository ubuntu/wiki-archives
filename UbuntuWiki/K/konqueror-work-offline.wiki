=== Summary ===

A Work Offline feature as is available in Firefox should also be available in Konqueror. That is, we should be able to select Work Offline from the menu.

=== Rationale ===

Currently, if we want to read a page which we recently read but we are now offline, we are not able to read the page because Konqueror tries to access the net. The Work Offline feature should be enabled.

=== Use cases ===

Ram is currently offline and he uses Konqueror to review a URL which he visited recently. He is not able to do it.

=== Implementation ===

I had this wish fixed for SUSE Linux 10.1 - see http://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=153250 (so it should not be a problem).
