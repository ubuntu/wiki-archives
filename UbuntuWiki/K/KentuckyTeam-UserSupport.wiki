=== Purpose ===

Our plan is to offer some limited phone (Skype, Gizmo, etc.) support to new users. We are thinking of offering ~2 hours of support one day a week. We feel that there are times that answering a user's question via the forums, IRC channel, or email is simply not enough.

=== Process ===
A user who needs voice support can submit a support request at our website, and a team member can respond by calling the user.  This connection could be made using the VOIP solution of our choice.

=== ToDo ===

* Determine which VO-IP solution to go use (Skype, Gizmo, etc.)
* Accept volunteers from the team to "man" the phones.
* Decide on a day to offer the service.

=== Works in Progress ===

* We are in a (small) testing phase with Skype now.

=== Notes ===

The Gizmo linux beta now supports voice chat across the major IM networks, so a user with a Windows machine can be called using Gizmo.  This might come in handy if the user has multiple machines -- one booted in Windows so that we can contact him/her free-of-charge, and another running Ubuntu -- or if we simply want to help the user with a Windows-related problem.
  The latest Gizmo beta debian package can be downloaded here: http://forum.gizmoproject.com/viewtopic.php?t=6798&sid=707a79237e920d78933d485c791b5736
