== About Me ==
My name is Pasquale aka kr0n1x. I'm 17 years old and my first (serious) experience with Linux world started in October 2006 thanks to Ubuntu Edgy. I used it with my old USB modem Michelangelo USB CX (in past was impossible for me to make it works with other distro or version of Ubuntu).<<BR>>
Now Ubuntu is my preferred distro and i'm using the 64 bit version of Gutsy (thanks Conroe E6300!)<<BR>>
I study (4° year) at ITI Mottura high school in Caltanissetta (i'm trying i mean :D), Sicily!!!<<BR>>
