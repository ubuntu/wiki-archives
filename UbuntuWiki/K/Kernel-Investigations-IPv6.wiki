Various investigations as to how well Ubuntu works with IPv6

== Installation ==

How well does installation work on IPv6 enabled networks.

=== IPv6 (dual stack) Installation ===

Machine on an IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack network.  This seems to work perfectly.

=== IPv6 only (w/o dn64) Installation ===

Machine on an IPv6 network only supporting IPv6 addressing and only able to access systems offering IPv6 addresses (no dns64).  Other than the issues below the installation completed as normal including downloading appropriate files (language packs etc) during install:

* installation reports the machine is "not on the internet"
* start.ubuntu.com is not available on IPv6 at all affecting the firefox start screen

=== IPv6 only (w/ dns64) Installation ===

Machine on an IPv6 network supporting IPv6 addressing but with a DNS64/NAT64 gateway.  This seems to work perfectly.
