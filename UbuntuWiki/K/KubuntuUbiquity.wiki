__TOC__

Kubuntu Ubiquity is a KDE frontend to the new Ubiquity live installer for Ubuntu.

Get it from the archives as ubiquity-frontend-kde or from Jonathan's bzr archive: ''bzr branch http://kubuntu.org/~jriddell/bzr/ubiquity/ubuntu/"
[bzr is a new distributed revision control system from Canonical, you can get it from dapper universe, branches can take some time]

Best way to run it is from a dapper live CD on a computer where you don't care if the hard disk gets wiped.
