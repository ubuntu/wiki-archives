__TOC__

=== Membership ===

Alessandro Ghersi was made a Kubuntu member

=== Specs ===

The UDS specs for Karmic at https://wiki.kubuntu.org/KubuntuKarmicSpecs were discussed.

=== Council membership ===

It's council refresh time.  nixternal, tonio and yuiry stepped down, we thank them for their service.  

apachelogger, JontheEchidna, rgreening and vorian were nominated.  Jonathan will forward their names to the Community Council for the requested vote.

=== Tutorials Day ===

We hope to have another tutorials  day soon, Jonathan to organise.

=== Karmic defaults ===

We  agreed to remove the zero timeout for KWin border actions.

=== kdeaccessibility ===

Harald noted that this is poorly maintained (upstream) and the apps should be checked if they still work.

=== 100 Usability papercuts ===

There was a desire for Kubuntu to  be part of the 100 papercuts movement.  We will work out a method for  having bugs nominated and sent to the design team.

=== Amarok  splash screen ===

It was noted that Amarok can take longer than the busy cursor timeout to start.  It was also noted that splash screens are evil.  No resolution was reached.
