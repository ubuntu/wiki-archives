| lua-event
| FTBFS
| doesn't build with libevent2. I've already contacted the Debian maintainer about this one. Debian package is based on the fork of the upstream luaevent project, made only for one package: prosody. Supposedly, all changes from this fork has already been merged in the original project, and it builds with libevent2 so I've asked Debian maintainer to help me investigate it and the Prosody's author has promised to check if we can replace the forked lua-event with the original one.
