=== I have uploaded a new Ubuntu kernel, who needs to know about it? ===

A number of groups are affected by new Kernel uploads we therefore send out an announcement email to a number of groups for each upload.  We announce each Kernel upload to the people indicated in the ''Announce kernel uploads'' section of the <nowiki>[[KernelTeam-KernelMaintenance]]</nowiki> guide.
