=== Interests ===

* Linux. I've been working with the GNU/Linux system since 1997. Slackware is what I began with, and moved to Mandrake, then Gentoo, followed by Debian, which has evolved into Ubuntu. I worked as a lead developer for Macaroni Linux from 2003 to early 2006.
* Networking. I hold an Associates of Applied Science Degree in Computer Networking Systems. One of my many job roles is a network administrator for a Microsoft solutions company.
* Security. I hold a Bachelors of Science degree in Information Security Systems.

=== Role with Ubuntu ===

* I'm currently on the LaptopTestingTeam. I test development releases and submit reports to developers to resolve issues.

* I've also done some work on the Kernel/Compile documentation.
