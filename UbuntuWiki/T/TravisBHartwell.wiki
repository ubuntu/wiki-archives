=== Interests ===
* Haskell
* Python
* Emacs
* Ubuntu
* Programming Languages
* Usability

=== Ideas and Wants for Ubuntu ===
* Latest Evolution (I hear it is faster and doesn't use as much memory)
* Ability to select a track to play from Gnome Do (not just artist or album)
* Working and non-buggy gmail/google accounts integration with the messaging indicator
* Easier and/or additional tooling around libvirt for testing and debugging of packages
* Scripts to manage the source of build dependencies of a package for easy debugging
** Including setting up gdb with proper paths
** Including setting up cscope with proper paths
* Proper syncing of gmail/google accounts contacts with Ubuntu One

=== Lessons and tips learned in debugging and triaging bug reports ===

* When there is a gap in the last known working version and the one
 showing the problem, either:
** start at the version prior to the reported non-working version, attempting to reproduce the error
** start at the version right after the last known working version, attempting to reproduce the error
** when you have found the version that is the boundary between working and non-working, look at the diff between the versions and start debugging there

* When debugging C code, especially event-based Gtk code, it is often easier to use printf-style debugging to trace the execution of code, rather than gdb, to find out when certain functions are called

* When using gdb, and you only want to see the value of a variable at a certain point, set a breakpoint at the desired line, and then immediately after, do something like this:

 <pre>
 commands
 print var
 cont
 end
 </pre>

* KVM and the like are very useful for testing various circumstances like problems after upgrading from one release to another.
