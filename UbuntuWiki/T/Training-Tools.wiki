==== LyX ====

LyX is not a viable option, not even with a lot of effort.

===== Pros =====
* Your opinion might be here

===== Cons =====
* Lyx support for DocBook seems to be limited to:
** Docbook sgml (not xml!)
** only for older versions up to 1.2.0
** only export to DocBook (lyx-to-x)
** see also http://wiki.lyx.org/LyX/DocBook
** the tool: http://www.karakas-online.de/mySGML/

==== Eclipse ====

Eclipse is a Java based IDE (Integrated Development Environment). Plugins for the bazaar VCS and XML exist:
* http://bazaar-vcs.org/BzrEclipse
** depends on bzr-xmloutput, see http://bazaar-vcs.org/
** installation instructions on the website
* vex eclipse plugin
** http://vex.sourceforge.net
** lgpl, free license
** wysiwyg docbook editing
** doesn't seem to support xinclude (yet?)
** vex cookbook: <nowiki>[[attachment:VexCookbook.pdf]]</nowiki>
** latest release 2005/04/05
** seems to be +- unmaintained since 03/2007 (might encourage author?)
** looks like best candidate for extension into a full free speech docbook solution

* oxygen
** http://www.oxygenxml.com/docbook_editor.html
** wysiwyg editing
** 1 click pdf conversion
** looks like best candidate for immediate use 

* http://www.xmlbuddy.com/
** free beer, not speech
** installation: Unzip plugin to Eclipse plugin directory
** no wysiwyg editing

===== Pros =====
* might be able to develop 'rich client' based on Eclipse
* integration with bazaar
* plugins are exchangeble, e.g. oxygen instead of xmlbuddy

===== Cons =====
* Initial setup of plugins difficult, not possible through Synaptic
* Complete IDE interface is bloated for the task at hand

==== XMLmind ====
* http://www.xmlmind.com/xmleditor/
* not free-as-in-freedom software !

==== Syntext Serna ====
* http://www.syntext.com/products/serna/order.htm

==== Butterfly XML editor ====
* http://butterflyxml.org

==== Conglomerate ====
* WYSIWYG XML Editor
* not stable
* DocBook XML
* maintenance mode, see http://lists.copyleft.no/pipermail/conglomerate-devel/2007-July/003744.html
