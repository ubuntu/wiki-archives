__TOC__

This guide instructs you how to install version 0.5.0 of The Ur-Quan Masters on Ubuntu 5.10.

'''<nowiki>[[http://sc2.sourceforge.net/|The Ur-Quan Masters]]</nowiki>''' is a space Epic consisting of space exploration, combat and diplomacy. It's a remake of the 1992 '''Accolade''' classic title '''<nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Control_II#Star_Control_II|Star Control II - The Ur-Quan Masters]]</nowiki>'''. It's released under the '''<nowiki>[[http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html|GNU General Public License]]</nowiki>'''.

== Getting up-to-date libraries ==
The game requires some newer libraries than Ubuntu 5.10 was shipped with. Here's how to get them. The libraries one needs to update are '''libogg0''', '''libvorbis0a''' and '''libvorbisfile3'''.

To update '''libogg0''', goto http://packages.debian.org/testing/libs/libogg0 and download the .deb package for your architecture. (you're probably on i386 if this doesn't ring any bells) Open terminal and move to the folder you saved the .deb file to. Then '''`sudo dpkg -i [package name.deb]`''' Repeat for the other two libraries.

== Installing the game ==
Open Synaptic manager. Goto settings > repositories > add > custom and input '''`deb http://uqm.debian.net/ testing/`''' Close settings window and search for '''uqm'''. You should see '''The Ur-Quan Masters 0.5.0''' in the list. Select it for installation. There are also optional music and speech packages available, mark them if you'd like to get them. Apply.

== Starting the game ==
Open terminal and type '''`uqm`'''. That's it.
Heck, I'll even throw you a free <nowiki>[[http://img293.imageshack.us/img293/5315/theurquanmastersicon2cy.png|icon]]</nowiki> on the deal!
