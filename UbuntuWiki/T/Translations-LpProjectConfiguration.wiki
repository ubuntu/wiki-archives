__TOC__

This guide provides instructions and best-practice guidelines on how to set up a project for translations in Launchpad.

=== Set up project-wide translations settings ===

|}

You'll generally set this when you create the project in Launchpad. Thus you'll only need to set these once (but you can change them at any time):

# Go to https://translations.launchpad.net/$YOURPROJECT/+configure-translations
# Set '''Type of service for translations application:''' to '''Launchpad'''
# Set '''Translation focus:''' to your development trunk. This affects the visibility of translations in Launbhpad. You can change this later to another branch you want translators to focus on.
# Set '''Translation group:''' to '''Ubuntu Translators'''. This will define who can review translations. Ubuntu Translators is a group of experienced translators organized in language teams that care for the quality of translations
# Set '''Translation permissions policy:''' to Restricted. This will ensure only the translations group set above can change translations.
# Press '''Change''' to apply the settings

=== Set up series-specific translation settings ===

You'll generally set these as part of the tasks of creating a new series.

# Go to https://translations.launchpad.net/$YOURPROJECT/$SERIESBRANCH/+translations-settings
# Set up '''automatic imports''' to update exposed strings automatically from the .pot file in the source tree: set '''Import settings:''' to '''Import template files'''
# Set up '''automatic exports''' to auto-commit translations to your trunk branch by clicking on the '''Choose a target branch''' link and setting the branch there, using the format <code>~$TEAM/$YOURPROJECT/$SERIESBRANCH</code>

Notes:
* You can also set the translations for all series from a single location at https://translations.launchpad.net/$YOURPROJECT - use the '''automatic import''' link for the relevant branch in the '''Set up translations for a series'''
* Automatic exports work by auto-committing translations done through the web UI. Only the .po files for the languages changed are committed, in a single transaction, daily.
