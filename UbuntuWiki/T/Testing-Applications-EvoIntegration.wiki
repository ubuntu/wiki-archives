INSTRUCTIONS:
Replace the word PACKAGE with the package (or packages) that contains this application.  If more than one package is involved, list them.

Replace the word SRC-PACKAGE with the source package from which the installer package comes since bugs are filed against source packages.

If there is more than one package involved in this application, do the following:
- Instead of just "Tests", make "myapp" and "myapp-plugins" sections
- Separate out as best you can which tests go with which package (ex: myapp and myapp-plugins)
- The "Report any bugs you find..." line should be placed under each of those package section headings with the appropriate SRC-PACKAGE string
</pre>

These tests are to test how the Evolution Data Server is integrated into the rest of GNOME and how different parts of Evolution interact with each other.  Please try to run all of the following tests.
