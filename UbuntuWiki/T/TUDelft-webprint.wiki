==== Other printing manuals ====
** In addition, a <nowiki>[[https://intranet.tudelft.nl/live/pagina.jsp?id=8b34656b-2d92-494a-b94e-7929be3b95b1&lang=nl&binary=/doc/Linux-Printing_Guide.pdf|manual]]</nowiki> for webprint on Linux is at manual (this manual is not listed on the manuals page, but it works. It is handy if you don't want to use the GUI printer configuration but instead would rather like to do it via the web administration interface to CUPS, the Common Unix Printing System).
** Manual above is based on <nowiki>[[http://wiki.tudelft.nl/bin/viewauth/Research/UsingLinuxInTpm|UsingLinuxInTpm]]</nowiki>(needs authentication) 
** Which is based on the 'official' instructions at <nowiki>[[http://wiki.tudelft.nl/bin/view/Organisation/UD/ICT/UsingSuseEnterpriseLinux11|UsingSuseEnterpriseLinux11]]</nowiki>
