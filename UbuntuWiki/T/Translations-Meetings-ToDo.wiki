__TOC__

On this page you will find the todo items for the translation coordination group. These todo items are decided on and reviewed during our bi-weekly <nowiki>[[Translations-Meetings-|meetings]]</nowiki>.

'''UPDATE''': This page will stay here for a while only for reference purposes. We now track our TODO's on the <nowiki>[[https://trello.com/board/translations-team/4f621c87861db54230b9ca39|Translations board]]</nowiki> on Trello.

== ToDo ==

Statuses in this table are: TODO, WAITING, IN PROGRESS, BLOCKED where waiting means that the task is not to be started until later and blocked means that we are waiting for someone else. Keep blocked and waiting at the bottom.
