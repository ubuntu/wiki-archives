== What is Ubuntu Kylin? ==

The objective of the Ubuntu Kylin project is to create a variant of Ubuntu that is more suitable for Chinese users. We are committed to provide you with a delicate, thoughtful and fully customized Chinese user experience out-of-the-box. For instance, by providing a desktop user interface localized in Chinese and installing common software that Chinese users commonly use by default. Ubuntu Kylin has been a formal member of the Ubuntu family  since Ubuntu Kylin 13.04. Now, we are happy to  announce the release of Ubuntu Kylin 14.04 LTS.

== Features in Ubuntu Kylin 14.04 LTS Release ==

In this final release, the Linux kernel is upgraded to 3.13 and Unity is upgraded to 7.2. Specifically designed for efficient Chinese input, 14.04 LTS has the Sogou Input Method, a typing tool that provides intelligent predictive search and auto-complete. Sogou, combined with Kingsoft WPS office suite, makes Ubuntu Kylin 14.04 LTS even faster and easier to use when creating documents and browsing the web. The new release also includes Kingsoft Kuaipan, the cloud file syncing application, which offers a maximum of 2TB personal cloud storage and provides rapid access to files and content to any Kuaipan-compatible device over the web.  A lightweight Ubuntu Kylin software center is provided to supports both Ubuntu and Ubuntu Kylin archives. Users can easily enjoy popular Chinese applications co-developed by Ubuntu Kylin team!
