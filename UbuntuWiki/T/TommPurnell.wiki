I'm Tomm, I'm a pretty dull guy. I do, however, use Linux for my desktop, and have for five years, so I know like, 6 things that might be useful.  I do a lot of lightweight scientific computing stuff, and can usually be found pretty easily in '''#ubuntu''' or '''#physics''' on freenode. I'm a member of [NewUserMentors]
