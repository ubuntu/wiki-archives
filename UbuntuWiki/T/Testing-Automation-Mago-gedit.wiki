=== Oracle files (Please contribute!) ===

An oracle, in software testing, is "A mechanism to produce the predicted outcomes to compare with the actual outcomes of the software under test" (http://www.ee.oulu.fi/research/ouspg/sage/glossary/). Attached to this page you can find the oracle files that we are using to test Gedit. If you have a file that crashes gedit or fails to save correctly, please, attach it to this page, and it will be included in the test.
