This page describes the trophy suggestions for the Ubuntu accomplishment system.

== Accomplishments to move forward with ==

The accomplishments in this sections all come from the suggestions below and have been approved by Jono Bacon as fitting with his idea for good accomplishments.

| '''Description'''
| '''Implementability'''
|-
| Become an upstream translator
| [-] I can't think of an easy way to check this, especially as we rely on Launchpad IDs, which have no guaranteed match as upstream accounts. Damned lies uses OpenId, so it might be doable, but only if the translator uses his LP OpenID (and the last time I heard, OpenId login was broken on Damned Lies) [dpm]
|-
| Become an approved translator
| [+] Most probably easy to check with the LP API (check if user is member of a translation team). There is no API to detect if a team is a translations team, but it can probably be implemented with a workaround [dpm]
|-
| Make a translation suggestion
| [-] There's no API for suggestions, I can't think of a way to check other than screenscraping the translations page of a user [dpm]
|-
| Have a translation suggestion approved
| [-] Same as above [dpm]
|-
| Make a documentation translation suggestion
| [-] Same as above [dpm]
|-
| Have a documentation translation suggestion approved
| [-] Same as above [dpm]
|-
| File a l10n or i18n related bug
| [+] Can probably be checked through LP API, but would need to check [dpm]
|-
| Fix a l10n or i18n related bug
| [+] Same as above [dpm]
