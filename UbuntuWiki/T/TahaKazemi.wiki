A simple Linux user, who thinks it's a great opportunity for anyone to try Linux at least once in a lifetime, and it's not an ideal thought anymore since Linux has become a home OS besides being Server  OS, previously it was a famous sentence that in 21st century anyone who doesn't have any knowledge about computer science is an illiterate, but in 2 or 3 years from now, the condition to be an illiterate will be having no knowledge about Linux.

In Linux world, and in fact in general, in computer science world, no one is perfect, nor am I, but I'd like to share all my knowledge about computer and specially Linux even if my knowledge is too poor to be shared.
