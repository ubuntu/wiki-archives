=== The Ubuntu Desktop Course ILT ===
The first Ubuntu Desktop Course, Instructor Led Training (ILT) was developed using DocBook to design and write the content.  The first course was released for version 7.04 and then updated to version 8.04 LTS in late 2008.  We are currently in the process of planning the update process for the 10.04 LTS release.
