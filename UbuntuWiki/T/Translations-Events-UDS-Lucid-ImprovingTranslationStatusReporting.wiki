== Session Notes ==

<pre>
=== Improving translation reporting ===

* Kyle: organize both languages and packages into categories to express how 
   well Ubuntu is translated for the important languages and important languages
* Definitions of language tiers must be tied to the activity and support of the
   language, not only statistics

* make translation reports/status visible to users / decision makers/takers

=== What to report on ===

Assuming we have the data (one way or another: manual data export or LP API), we should:

* How well supported Ubuntu is in your language?
* What needs work?
* perceived completeness of translations / per language

To properly report on what the status is, we need to define language and package tiers.

Adi interested in reporting the deltas with upstream

=== Actions ===

* Danilo to add more information to the current raw data export:
** number of strings that needs review or changed from upstream
** date of last change done for a template for each language
** priority value
** create report for curent stable and dev release

* Finalize templates priority (Adi/David)
** https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Translations/TemplatesPriority

* David to define language tiers and process for promoting languages.
