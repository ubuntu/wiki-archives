INSTRUCTIONS:
Replace the word PACKAGE with the package (or packages) that contains this application.  If more than one package is involved, list them.

Replace the word SRC-PACKAGE with the source package from which the installer package comes since bugs are filed against source packages.

If there is more than one package involved in this application, do the following:
- Instead of just "Tests", make "myapp" and "myapp-plugins" sections
- Separate out as best you can which tests go with which package (ex: myapp and myapp-plugins)
- The "Report any bugs you find..." line should be placed under each of those package section headings with the appropriate SRC-PACKAGE string
</pre>

These tests are to test the functionality of the Tomboy package.  Please try to run all of the following tests.

Report any bugs you find using the following command in a terminal:

<pre>
ubuntu-bug tomboy
</pre>

You can learn more about reporting bugs at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/ReportingBugs.
