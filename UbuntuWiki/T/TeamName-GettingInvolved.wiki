=== Introducing Ubuntu Team ===

One of the things that is often asked is how could new contributors to Ubuntu help? There are several areas where you can contribute and help with. This page will cover each and every area. Then, it is for you to decide which area you would like to join as per your interests and experience. Please understand Ubuntu is a community project and all the members of this project are working on voluntary basis. We do what we do because we simply love it. If you have that passion, then you are indeed in the right place. Ubuntu needs you. With your help, we could be even better.

==== Getting Involved - Video ====

Instead of reading this page, you do now have an option to watch a full guide about this page and the whole process of getting involved - See This.

==== I am not a developer ====

The great news is: you do not have to be a developer in order to contribute and get involved with Ubuntu Team.
