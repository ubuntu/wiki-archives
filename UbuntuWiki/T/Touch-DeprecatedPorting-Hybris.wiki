=== Misc hybris related porting information ===

From: Penk Chen <penk.chen@canonical.com>

Here's some guide [1][2] I used for libhybris porting, and it's almost
like a drop-in replacement on Android. Here are the steps:

1. <nowiki>[[http://pastie.org/pastes/7649385/download|Patch]]</nowiki> and rebuild bionic (libc.so) using the original Android source tree
2. Copy or bind mount /system and /vendor (usually a symlink to /system/vendor) directories to your chroot rootfs
3. Replace chroot/system/lib/libc.so with the patched one
4. Hybris will parse build.prop for platform string (ro.board.platform), and try to guess which gralloc library to be used, sometimes it's easier just copy the vendor .so to /system/lib/hw/gralloc.default.so
5. To verify if hybris works, try executing some simple command like /system/bin/logcat
6. If everything works fine, you should see test_glesv2 running on the screen, note that you can close all Android UI by "adb shell stop"
