This is the blueprint page for laying out the system for giving Transmuter users the ability to define their own options.

== Config Type ==
Thinking about what we want for the future here (easy editing, GUI front-end to edit configs) what format would be best?
* Plain text will be best
What path is best for the config?
* ~/.transmuter.conf
* ~/.config/Transmuter/transmuter.conf
The 2nd one would be good because it also gives us a place to output logging and such.

== Config Options ==
What options should be given?
* INPUT=
* OUTPUT=
* FORMAT=
* ROCKBOX=y/n
* COVERS=y/n
What of these options should be global? Can there be "profile names" where people set up options for their "ipod" then the above options are under that?
== Config Example ==
<pre>
PROFILE=vorbis [
  INPUT=~/FLAC
  OUTPUT=~/
  FORMAT=vorbis
  ENCODER_OPTIONS=-q 5
  ROCKBOX=y
  COVERS=y
]

PROFILE=ipod [
  INPUT=~/FLAC
  OUTPUT=/media/ipod
  FORMAT=mp3
  ENCODER_OPTIONS=-V 3 --vbr-new
  ROCKBOX=y
  COVERS=y
]
</pre>

The "-f" option for format might need to be changed to something else that better means ''Use this profile setting.'' So a user sets their own options in '''PROFILE'''. That way, one can set "ipod" as a profile and Transmuter uses those settings.

== How does the user get a config file ==
I'm thinking that if a user runs '''transmuter''' without options it will scan for a config in ~/.config/Transmuter/transmuter.conf. If not there, it will copy a default one from the system somewhere (/usr/share/Transmuter/transmuter.conf or something) and use that. User can edit from there.
