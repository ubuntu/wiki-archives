__TOC__

Yay, it's me here at ubuntu. I am hoping to become a ubuntite by the end of October. Right now I am using Fedora Core 2, which is mildly ewwish. The version of Gnome I have is also ew. It's just weird, so right now I'm using fluxbox :) More later. For the latest on me, go to [www.maxkelley.com].
