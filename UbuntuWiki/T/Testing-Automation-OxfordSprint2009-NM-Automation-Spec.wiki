* Accessibility information
 nm-applet doesn't provide any accessibility information. <nowiki>[[http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=574909|BUG#574909]]</nowiki> opened in bugzilla.gnome.org to report the problem and look for a solution.

 A temporary workaround might be to use at-spi directly to get the location information of the applet on the screen and generate a mouse event for that location. Unfortunately, this depends on the widget to be located always in the same place in the hierarchy which isn't guaranteed depending on the hardware.
