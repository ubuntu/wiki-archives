== Introduction ==

Welcome to the Ubuntu Mobile testing home. The pages linked within are designed to guide you through the process of setting up an environment, testing, and reporting bugs. As always, feel free to update these pages with any clarifications/additional information that you find useful along the way. Happy Hunting.

== Ubuntu Mobile Editions ==

There are two editions of Ubuntu Mobile. The difference between the two is based on the size of the device screen. For screens under 8", we have Ubuntu MID Edition. MID, or Mobile Internet Device, is a touchscreen based internet appliance that give users instant access to the web using a highly portable form factor. The Samsung Q1 is an excellent example of a MID.

The second is Ubuntu Mobile Edition. This edition is focussed on subnotebooks or netbooks. These are small laptop devices with screens starting at 8.9". A good example of a netbook is the Eee 901.

=== Ubuntu MID Edition ===
Ubuntu MID Edition targets an exciting new class of computers called Mobile Internet Devices. Ubuntu MID, based on the world's most popular Linux distribution, and MID hardware from OEMs and ODMs, is redefining what can be done in mobile computing.

Ubuntu MID Edition, a fully open source project, gives the full Internet, with no compromise. Custom options may include licensed codecs and popular third-party applications.

*** Full Web 2.0/AJAX fidelity, with custom options of Adobe Flash®, Java, and more
*** Outstanding media playback so you can enjoy videos, music and photos with superior quality and easy navigation
*** A suite of applications that work seamlessly to meet every need of a digital parent, student or anyone who is on-the-go
*** Facebook®, MySpace®, YouTube®, Dailymotion®, 3D games, GPS, maps, in short, the full Web 2.0 experience delivered into your hands as a compact and powerful device that's easy and fun to use

The product of Canonical collaboration with Intel® and the open source community, Ubuntu MID Edition is the software that makes it all possible.

=== Ubuntu Mobile Edition ===

Ubuntu Mobile Edition is optimised to run on a new category of affordable Internet-centric devices called netbooks. It includes a new consumer-friendly interface that allows users to quickly and easily get on-line and use their favourite applications. This interface is optimised for a retail sales environment. 

Ubuntu Mobile Edition, also a fully open source project, gives the full Internet, with no compromise. Custom options may include licensed codecs and popular third-party applications.
