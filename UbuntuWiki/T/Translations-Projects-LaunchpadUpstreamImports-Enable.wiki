=== Case 1: No upstream project in Launchpad, community creates it ===

# Create the upstream project in LP in case it's not already created (anyone can do this)
# Set up an upstream mirror branch for the upstream LP project (only project owners can do this)
# Set up automatic translation imports in the upstream LP project (only project owners can do this)
# Set up a link to an Ubuntu source package in the upstream LP project (anyone can do this)
# At this point upstream imports sharing should be working
# Optionally, give ownership of the project created in 1. to the actual upstream maintainer, someone actively willing to maintain it or to the <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:registry-administrators|to the registry administrators]]</nowiki>.
