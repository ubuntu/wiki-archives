__TOC__

Trivial suggestions for Breezy:

=== Administration tools ===

1. Modify gnome user editor for allowing user quotas (% and MB)

=== Boot ===

1. '''Graphical boot''': Put graphical boot instead of text boot
 Now, we have only a text boot (grub or lilo). Beautiful if graphical grub/lilo is present. You could make some modification is grub/lilo that improve graphical boot:

 1. put items with icons in grub:

    [icon] Windows
    [icon] Ubuntu Linux
    ...

    with predefined icons (user could select those in a admin tool)

 1. The graph boot are the default if not server or custom installation has been selected, and if some decent videocard is present (in installation ubuntu could know it)

=== Desktop ===

1. '''Program for participation of desktop users''': a program that are a shortcut of several possibilities: join irc, make suggestions (perhaps it could be threated as pre-wishlists), make a question (user could connect with the "closer" (that knows about that, that is weak up, ...) developer/helper that helps in his/her doubt)

2. Is it possible to have a '''copy-paste/drag-and-drop with CD''' burner and nautilus: it automatically see what's the system of cdr (multisession, iso9660, ... or virgin media) and writes to cdr according with that info.

=== Web page ===

1. '''Developer report''': monthly report about a developer that works in/for ubuntu (life, what are his/her dedications, ...) (like gentoo but plus more)

1. '''Statistics''' about:

## bugs (solved, opened,... what are the developer that helps to close more bugs, ...)
## nunmber of download of .iso
  
=== Other ===

1. '''Prize''' of ''''developer of the month''':

*** elected by other developers
*** elected by objective criteria:
**** maximum number of closed bugs
**** maximum number of discovered bugs
**** more active in irc
**** number of translator

1. What's about "official" '''betatesters'''?
