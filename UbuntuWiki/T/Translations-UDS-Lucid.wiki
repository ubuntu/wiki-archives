=== Introduction ===

The purpose of this page is to list all suggestions for the UDS Lucid translation sessions to be used as a basis for the final schedule.

=== Session proposals ===

==== Final list ====

===== Blueprints =====

* '''<nowiki>[[https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/community-lucid-improving-documentation-translation|Improving documentation translation]]</nowiki>''' (AdiRoiban)
** Cross session with the documentation team to discuss topics such as:
** Feedback regarding the current ubuntu-docs translation process
** Status of Kubuntu and Xubuntu docs
** See how we can translate help files and other docs and training materials
** Naming of translation templates for translation on Launchpad
** See how we can collaborate for translating Ubuntu Learning Materials and Ubuntu Packaging Guide
** Presentation of the doctemplate project (KyleNitzsche)
** A new/developing LP project (lp.net/doctemplate) that provides a documentation template that can be added to packages or used for stand alone docs. Source is docbook article or book. It's fully localizable (images and strings), with pdf, html, html-with-javascript and docbook outputs. Also, discuss integration with LP: translation work flow, and possible LP improvements: Documentation tab, Doc privileges and assignment (like translations), import/export to/from LP, LP for image localization, LP display of localized content

* '''<nowiki>[[https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/community-lucid-browser-start-page-l10n|Browser start page localisation]]</nowiki>''' (TimoJyrinki)
** <nowiki>[[https://lists.canonical.com/archives/ubuntu-website/2009-July/000762.html|mailing list post]]</nowiki> - in summary, localisation of the "Participate" page and "Help" link URL (if deemed proper), how to escalate
** Discuss if the link from the start page should point to localized resources and can we check their quality
** In 8.10 the search results were localized but now in 9.04 and 9.10 the search results are only for English <nowiki>[[https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu-start-page/+bug/363381|bug 363381]]</nowiki>
** Take a quick look at the current opened bugs https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu-start-page/+bugs

* '''<nowiki>[[https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/lucid-qa-community-testing-translations|Testing for Translations]]</nowiki>''' (AraPulido, DavidPlanella)
** Cross session Translations/QA about <nowiki>[[http://testcases.qa.ubuntu.com/|test cases]]</nowiki> for translations. We could come up with a good blueprint for Lucid to add those kind of cases to the ISO tracker.
** Suggestion: it would be interesting to have some advice from the testing team on:
*** Testing/finding out untranslatable strings
*** Testing language packs on stable releases
** Encourage non-english speaking developers or advance users to use the translated version of Ubuntu

* '''<nowiki>[[https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/community-lucid-improving-translation-status-reporting|Improving translation status reporting]]</nowiki>''' (DavidPlanella)
** We haven't got a Launchpad Translations API, but for gathering translations statistics, template names, etc, we've got daily updated data here -> http://people.canonical.com/~danilo/ubuntu/. ''Note: the data is not from the production database, which means that it is a couple of days behind''
** What information is missing
** number of strings that needs review or changed from upstream
** date of last change done for a template for each language
** priority value
** create report for curent stable and dev release
** What can we do with that data?
*** Providing stats based on distro
**** How do we report on languages? Kyle suggests a tiered language approach.
*** Provide diferent views of templates, e.g. package sets (with links to LP for the actual translations)
*** Provide a list of old templates as possible candidates for being obsoleted
*** As a prototype for further Rosetta feature use an external page to test various enhancement that can we reached by used those data - ex. http://l10n.ubuntu.tla.ro/jaunty-l10n-status/lang.html?ro
*** Create a RSS/email-notifications for new changes in templates, new sugestions, etc.
** We can show those info in a more usefull format - http://l10n.ubuntu.tla.ro/karmic-report/

* '''<nowiki>[[https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/community-lucid-community-participation-in-coordinating-translations|Community participation in coordinating translations]]</nowiki>''' (DavidPlanella)
** On the last cycle we saw the UbuntuTranslationCoordinators team building up. It has worked very well so far, and it would be interesting to have some feedback.
** We want to have a well documented and transparent process, in which the community can contribute
** Try to build a team that can cover all languages. Ex right now we miss Arab coverage.
** Some of the actions the UTC is responsible for are already documented at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuTranslationsCoordinators#Actions. These might need to be expanded and perhaps we can also come up with a schedule on when to do the regular actions. Also there are some actions only David and Arne can do right now, should they be expanded to the whole group?
** Changing translation focus in Launchpad 
** Requesting language pack exports - copy langauge packs into ubuntu-updates
** ...

* '''<nowiki>[[https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/community-lucid-kubuntu-translations-feedback-and-improvements|Kubuntu Translations feedback and improvements]]</nowiki>''' (DavidPlanella)
** Status of Kubuntu translations
** Feedback on the improvement effort discussed on the last UDS and fleshed out during the Karmic development cycle.
** Using Launchpad Translations for projects using TS files 
** Look at KDE source packages that have all POT files in the same folder.
** talk about kde-l10n-CC kde-i18n-CC and langauge-pack-kde

* '''<nowiki>[[https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/community-lucid-increasing-lp-translations-dev-community-contributions|Increasing community developer contributions in Launchpad Translations]]</nowiki>''' (DavidPlanella)
** Launchpad is now Open Source
** There are lots of feature requests on Launchpad Translations, which the community could participate in or implement themselves
** We'd like to discuss ways in which we could encourage or ease community developer contributions to Launchpad Translations.

* '''<nowiki>[[https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/community-lucid-translations-best-practices-and-policies|Translations best practices and policies]]</nowiki>''' (DavidPlanella)
** Currently there is no authoritative set of policies for better structuring the Ubuntu Translations process
** We should discuss for which aspects of the translations process we'd like to have <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Translations/KnowledgeBase#Policies|documented policies]]</nowiki>, draft those and let the Ubuntu translations community ratify them.
** It would also be useful to have a collection of best practices for Ubuntu translation teams, including guidelines on how to run a team, how to accept new members, how to communicate within the team, how to interact with upstreams and how to work collaboratively and ensure translation quality.
** Review of https://help.launchpad.net/Translations/Guide
** Review and complete https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Translations/KnowledgeBase/#Guidelines, see if there is any content that can be merged

* '''<nowiki>[[https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/community-lucid-lp-translations-roundtable|Launchpad Translations roundtable]]</nowiki>''' (<nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~danilo|Danilo]]</nowiki>, UrsulaJunque)
** Roundtable session where the LP Translations devs can expose what's coming in the next cycle and get feedback and answer questions from users
** Topics from translators:
*** ''Translation sharing between Ubuntu and upstream projects hosted in LP'' (AdiRoiban)
*** Now that we have message sharing between ubuntu series, see if we can share those translations between Ubuntu and upstream projects hosted in LP
*** we need to sync the translation policy with the upstream projects. For example all upstream project should have the same translation policy as Ubuntu
*** example of project that will benefit from this feature
**** all Ubuntu specific packages as it will be easy to create an upstream branch - UNR , ubiquity
**** trasmission
**** Synaptic
**** ubuntu-start-page 

* '''<nowiki>[[https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/community-lucid-ubuntu-translations-project-feedback|Status and feedback about the Ubuntu Translations project]]</nowiki>''' (AdiRoiban)
** bugs handling
** answer tracking
** process documentation for translators and developers

* '''<nowiki>[[https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/desktop-lucid-firefox-translations|Firefox translation improvements for Lucid]]</nowiki>'''
** how to better utilize devmode
** export in upstream format
** export changes only
** export changes as upstream patch
** inform users how to create xpi from the xpi.po file
** feedback loop
** localized searchplugins - technical implementation, etc.

* '''<nowiki>[[https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/desktop-lucid-openoffice/|OpenOffice.org planning for Lucid]]</nowiki>'''
** We'd like to discuss OO.o translations on this informational session as well.

* '''<nowiki>[[https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/desktop-lucid-language-selector/|Language selector improvements]]</nowiki>'''
** Language selector improvements
** Continuation of the <nowiki>[[https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/desktop-karmic-language-selector-karmic|Karmic improvements]]</nowiki> for Lucid.

===== Roundtables =====

* '''Translations Community roundtable''' (DavidPlanella)
** Roundtable session to discuss the status of the Ubuntu translations community, possible improvements, etc.
** Topic proposals:
** Language pack schedule
** ArchiveReorg, upstream integration and translations: do we want to enable universe translations at some point?
** Ubuntu translator tools project
** Testing translations early in the development cycle - when do we want to open translations (on the web UI) for Lucid?
** Uploads to `-proposed` can modify templates, but what to do with the template if the upload is rejected for `-updates`? We could add a note on translations to StableReleaseUploads
** ISO codes translations
** packages.ubuntu.com translations

* '''Translations Community wrapup''' (DavidPlanella)
** Overview of all changes coming for Lucid.
** Wrapup and discussion of any other pending items.

==== Deferred ====

''These topics have not been included in the final list of sessions, but can nonetheless be discussed (e.g. in roundtables)''

* '''Indentifying the source package/template from UI strings ''' (AdiRoiban)
** see if we can have in LP a search feature that will look in all templates for a language
** see how we can identify strings that are not marked for translations
** Note: we can talk about this on the Launchpad Translations roundtable -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:dpm]]</nowiki> 
* '''Starting with Translations content''' (DavidPlanella)
** The main entry point for new Ubuntu translators is Launchpad and the wiki pages
** It would be very useful to have more dynamic content, such as tutorials/screencasts, which could also even be translated.
