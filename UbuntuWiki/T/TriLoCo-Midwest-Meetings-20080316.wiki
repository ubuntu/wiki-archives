2008-03-16 21:17:44 <       j1mc> | schultmc: sorry... i see.
2008-03-16 21:17:55 <        j1mc> | i thought you were saying that you were planning your gutsy release party.
2008-03-16 21:18:05 <        j1mc> | ... and i thought you were a little late.
2008-03-16 21:18:07 <    rick_h__> | penguicon is having a hardy pre-release party

2008-03-16 21:19:22 <    rick_h__> | I've never been before. The sci-fi part of it scared me off
2008-03-16 21:19:43 <    rick_h__> | but we're doing a packaging jam/partial, keysigning, and stuff with Mako and Jono
2008-03-16 21:19:47 <    rick_h__> | so lots of ubuntu stuff this year
2008-03-16 21:19:50 <   tnseditor> | cool
2008-03-16 21:19:52 <    schultmc> | j1mc: heh - we're planning our hardy release party now :)
2008-03-16 21:20:05 <    rick_h__> | getting close to time. I need to upgrade my laptop badly
2008-03-16 21:20:21 <        j1mc> | how frequently do you all schedule IRC meetings?
2008-03-16 21:20:23 <   tnseditor> | what do you want to do to it?
2008-03-16 21:20:25 <    schultmc> | monthly
2008-03-16 21:20:29 <    rick_h__> | usually twice a month
2008-03-16 21:20:35 <   tnseditor> | first and third Wednesdays
2008-03-16 21:20:52 <        j1mc> | do you put up agendas?  do people participate regularly?
2008-03-16 21:21:02 <   tnseditor> | some people participate regularly
2008-03-16 21:21:09 <   tnseditor> | although we would like it to be more
2008-03-16 21:21:13 <   tnseditor> | and we have an agenda
2008-03-16 21:21:26 < visualdecep> | we dont have an agenda really
2008-03-16 21:21:29 <    rick_h__> | yea, it depends. We've got the regulars, and normally a small agenda. But we're a bit laid back to be honest.
2008-03-16 21:21:31 <   tnseditor> | https://wiki.ubuntu.com/OhioTeam/Meetings/
2008-03-16 21:21:37 <   tnseditor> | we are too
2008-03-16 21:21:54 <        j1mc> | do you use google calendar to schedule everything?
2008-03-16 21:21:57 <    rick_h__> | yea
2008-03-16 21:22:00 < picard_pwns> | argh
2008-03-16 21:22:06 <   tnseditor> | our group used to
2008-03-16 21:22:14 <   tnseditor> | but we're fairly simple atm
2008-03-16 21:22:21 <    rick_h__> | looking at it now and need to get on greg about updating it
2008-03-16 21:22:41 < visualdecep> | we probably should set something like that up....
2008-03-16 21:23:07 <    rick_h__> | doens't take long, just setup a public calendar. Give a few guys write access
2008-03-16 21:23:08 <        j1mc> | we've had difficulty with just scheduling stuff, and it affects our momentum.
2008-03-16 21:23:30 <visualdecep> | schultmc: we dont have one hiding do we??
2008-03-16 21:23:34 <        j1mc> | for those who have a google calendar, what's your groups' google usernames?
2008-03-16 21:23:39 <    schultmc> | visualdeception: not that I'm aware of
2008-03-16 21:23:45 <   tnseditor> | brb.  I'm going back into Ubuntu
2008-03-16 21:23:53 <    schultmc> | we tend to schedule stuff on the mailing list but a calendar would be a good idea
2008-03-16 21:23:57 <    rick_h__> | anyone http://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=femf0etg1ffji3rh1tevl7ck08%40group.calendar.google.com&pvttk=5d233bf2d00bfc1489702f49db8a92f1
2008-03-16 21:24:06 <    rick_h__> | anyone putting together a bug jam or packagin jam?
2008-03-16 21:24:08            <-- | tnseditor has quit ("Leaving.")
2008-03-16 21:24:22 <    rick_h__> | I know jorge is putting together some material for them so if so ping him sometime
2008-03-16 21:24:39 < visualdecep> | i'll get one going....and shoot an email to the group when its up
2008-03-16 21:24:46 <    rick_h__> | bug jam is a hot thing right now with 5-a-day going on
2008-03-16 21:25:42 <   nixternal> | I know Jorge and I discussed having me run a packaging jam at Penguicon next month
2008-03-16 21:25:54 <    schultmc> | visualdeception: whoops
2008-03-16 21:25:55 <        j1mc> | rick_h__: did you create a separate google account for the loco?
2008-03-16 21:25:57 <    schultmc> | visualdeception: just set one up
2008-03-16 21:26:05 <    rick_h__> | j1mc: I just created it off my own account
2008-03-16 21:26:06 <    schultmc> | visualdeception: you can create one if you want
2008-03-16 21:26:09 <    rick_h__> | and then invited some guys to edit
2008-03-16 21:26:14 <        j1mc> | rick_h__: cool
2008-03-16 21:26:21 <    rick_h__> | nixternal: very cool if you want to do that
2008-03-16 21:26:40            --> | tnseditor [n=john@208.10.2.69] has joined #ubuntu-us-in
2008-03-16 21:26:45 <    rick_h__> | We were just talking about how best to handle it. The one I ran was a bit different with guys at my house for 8 hours
2008-03-16 21:26:46 <   tnseditor> | back
2008-03-16 21:27:01 <        j1mc> | rick_h__: easy enough.  :)
2008-03-16 21:27:16 <    rick_h__> | yea, well before the packaging some guys are doing a full keysigning thing
2008-03-16 21:27:21 <    rick_h__> | so that part should be all squared away
2008-03-16 21:27:31 <    rick_h__> | and I see the docs in the wiki have been updated a lot lately
2008-03-16 21:27:41 <    rick_h__> | so more stuff to go off of instead of the straight packaging docs
2008-03-16 21:28:01 <    rick_h__> | I guess the whole starting off with packaging something is a bit frowned upon.
2008-03-16 21:28:09 <    rick_h__> | stuff like fixing bugs, debdiff and such is more encouraged
2008-03-16 21:31:26 <    rick_h__> | well guys, if there's nothing more I'm out. Ping me with the next meeting stuff sometime so I can get it on our calendar
2008-03-16 21:31:29 <    rick_h__> | thanks
2008-03-16 21:31:32 <    schultmc> | cya
