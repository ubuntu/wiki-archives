=== About Tobias ===
I am 24 years old, live in Zürich, Switzerland and study Media Design.

=== Why using Ubuntu? ===
Ubuntu is a great way to spread the word about linux. Ubuntu has so much advantages. It is easy to use. It is friendly. It's design is great. And it 'just works'.

=== Experience ===
I started using Linux about 10 years ago with SuSE Linux (it wasn't called OpenSuSE at that time...).
I came across many distributions on my journey towards Ubuntu, among them Gentoo, RedHat, CentOS, Fedora, and others.
In 2008 I accomplished the LPI-2 certification and I am attending Conferences every year like the LinuxTag, LinuxCon, etc.
