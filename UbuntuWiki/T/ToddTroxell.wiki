=== FLOSS Hacking ===

I've been involved in The Debian Project for several years as maintainer of wmxres, and more recently in leading the team that maintains logcheck, logcheck-database, and logtail.  We have cleaned up 100+ bugs since taking over.  I've also done some bug triage for Debian.

I have much appreciation for Ubuntu's progress thus far, and I would like to help out where I am able.

=== Skills ===
* Being a python gangsta
* Security auditing / general knowledge
* System administration
* C, C++, PYTHON!, Perl, SH
* Technical documentation

=== Availability ===
My schedule has become hectic, and I am inactive.
