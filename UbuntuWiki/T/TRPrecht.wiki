=== About Me ===

Greetings!  My name is Travis. I have been using Ubuntu since 2007 when a co-worker convinced me to install a beta of 7.10 (Gutsy Gibbon). Northern Kentucky (Greater Cincinnati [Ohio]) is where I call home along with my wonderful wife and son.

My initial introduction to Linux didn't go so well. This was in the late 90s and my friend from out of state had sent me two distros to try (SuSE Linux & Linux-Mandrake). I really liked the interfaces, but had to reinstall windows because my NIC was not compatible, or I didn't know how to make it work.  This first attempt left me hesitant to try again 8-9 years later when my co-worker was telling my how much I was missing out.  I loaded the live-cd and noticed how much faster my laptop was already.  We spent the next half hour backing up my data so that I could install the beta that he was downloading of Gutsy.  From that day on, I've had at least one computer that was running Linux. 

I've tried the majority of various distros, but my main computer has always had Ubuntu on it. Currently, all of my devices run the Linux kernel. I've been able to  convert several friends and family members to Ubuntu, including my parents, which now I visit for social reasons instead of technical. :-D  

Ubuntu's vision for convergence has me deeply excited for the future of Ubuntu and Linux in general.  I think that I've been able to mentally visualize Mark's concept ever since the first public mention of it was made; which for some reason, various media outlets don't seem to grasp.  I think that it will be the future of personal computer and am impatiently awaiting the arrival of a true convergence device in the USA. 

=== Contributions ===

With my limited technical-code know-how, I try to help support via the UbuntuForums, AskUbuntu and provide details in bug reports in LaunchPad. Out in the real world I am weekly making attempts to rescue people from the proprietary and virus ridden worlds of Windows. 

Write your goals.

=== Future Goals ===
* I am interested in furthering my efforts to advocate converting users from Windows to better options, such as Ubuntu and its many flavors.
* I am studying for certifications (Linux+, RHCSA, etc) to further my career beyond L2 deskside support to more of an admin role.
* I am working on making a remix/spin that is aimed at church plants to give them everything they need out of the box for starting their own media department with the amazing free and opensource solutions that are available.
* Promote FLOSS and open source projects
* Aiming to Attend and participate in Ubuntu-related Events
