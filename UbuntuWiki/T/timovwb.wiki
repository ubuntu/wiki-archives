=== Summary ===
Started using Ubuntu occasionally as of the 6.10 release and as my main OS about 6 months later. After asking beginners questions myself, I helped users on a daily basis on the Ubuntu-NL forums where I became moderator and after a while, administrator.

=== Ubuntu activities ===
* <nowiki>[[http://ubuntu-nl.org|Ubuntu-NL]]</nowiki> Team member
* Administrator of the <nowiki>[[http://forum.ubuntu-nl.org|Ubuntu-NL forums]]</nowiki>
* Helping users with problems on the forums and IRC
* Various little things, like:
** * Reporting bugs
** * Fixing translations
** * Helping out where I can

=== Projects ===
I love to program in Python and PyGTK. All of these projects are written and work on Ubuntu:
** <nowiki>[[http://www.pigeonplanner.com|Pigeon Planner]]</nowiki> - A database program to record your pigeons
** <nowiki>[[http://xpsledchanger.sourceforge.net|XPS Led Changer]]</nowiki> - A GUI for dellLEDCtl to control the Dell XPS LEDs
** ACElab (Attitude and Competence Evaluation lab) - Designed for schools to evaluate students during practice lessons
** Noise Archive - Database and downloader of freely available noise albums

Besides these bigger applications, I also write little scripts for various purposes.

=== Future plans ===
* Getting my main program (Pigeon Planner) into the Debian/Ubuntu repositories
* Helping other Python/PyGTK apps
* Keep doing the things I do now :)
