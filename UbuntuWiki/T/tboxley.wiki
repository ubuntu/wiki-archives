== About Me ==

Hi there. I'm Thomas Boxley and I'm 17 years old and I'm a junior in high school. I'm from southern Illinois in the United States.

I'm a stereotypical geek and I enjoy helping people out when it comes to Linux stuff, especially when it concerns Ubuntu. You can always find me in Freenode, offering support when I can. I know a few computer coding languages as well.
