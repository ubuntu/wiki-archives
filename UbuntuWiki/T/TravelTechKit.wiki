__TOC__

Members of the Ubuntu community are no strangers to travel, as we frequently attend summits, sprints, and conferences around the world.  This page is organized to capture the hi-tech accessories that are useful to have around when traveling.

== Organization ==

The page organizes these accessories using the same vocabulary as the Ubuntu package repositories:
* '''Main''' - essential accessories necessary for productive computing on the go, ''and allowed in carry-on luggage''
* '''Restricted''' - other essential accessories, ''but must be in checked luggage''
* '''Universe''' - a larger set of useful (but non-essential) accessories, ''allowed on carry-on luggage''
* '''Multiverse''' - anything else that might be useful, even if impractical, ''in checked luggage or otherwise shipped to destinations''
* '''PPAs''' - things that are very useful to ''you'', that perhaps other people might be interested in; others can promote those to one of the other repositories as appropriate
