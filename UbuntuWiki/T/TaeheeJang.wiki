=== Testimonials ===

* Gunyoung Yoon (Dry8r3aD)
I'vs known Taehee since I joined Korea Ubuntu Community and served as a member of Korea LoCo Team. He was a leader of LoCo Team back then. And during his 2 years term, he achieved many things, and contributed so well on Ubuntu Community in Korea. One of the things I was amazed with him, is that he got he's momentum. He managed, organized, and successfully finished so many events here, including 'The Annual Ubuntu Seminar', which was held monthly, and several conferences with enterprise companies. He's contribution to our Korea LoCo Team helped us so much to spread about the Ubuntu Spirit in Korea. I must say, that it has been a honor to have him as a leader of our LoCo Team, guarantee that he will be a very suitable person for the Ubuntu Membership. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:Dry8r3aD]]</nowiki>
