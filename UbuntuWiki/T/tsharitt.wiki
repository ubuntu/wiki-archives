=== About Me ===

==== Summary ====

I've been a Linux user since about 1999. I started with a copy of Linux Mandrake 6.1 (I actually had some floppy distros prior, but Mandrake was the first one I ever installed and really used). I have used many distributions throughout the years, but switched to Ubuntu 6.06 in 2006. I still hop around to different distros, but I have used Linux exclusively since 2007.

=== My Contributions ===

==== Ubuntu Forums ====

I have been a member of the forums since 2007. I try to help wherever I can. I may not be the most knowledgeable person when it comes to Ubuntu, but I am always striving to learn more, and helping others on the forums has help me do just that.

I am a member of the Ubuntu Forums Beginners Team. We are a group of people who focus primarily on the <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=326|Absolute Beginner Talk]]</nowiki> section of the forums.

==== IRC ====

I am often found on <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InternetRelayChat|IRC]]</nowiki> on irc.freenode.net.
Some of my usual channels include:

I always try to find time to help others whenever I can.

==== Ubuntu Bug Squad ====

I try to spend a some time every day to help triage a few bugs. This usually consists of commenting, asking for more information, linking to upstream bugs, and adding packages.

Some sample bugs that I have worked on:

{{https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/@@/bug-unknown}} https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nautilus/+bug/315983/ <<BR>>

==== LoCo ====

Unfortunately, the Alabama LoCo is not very active. I would like to see the team become more active (occasional meetings would be a good start) by holding local events as well as participate more in the broader Ubuntu community. 

Aside from just trying to get the current members motivated, I am also trying to infuse some fresh blood by converting new users.

==== Future Plans ====
This is a list of goals which I am actively pursuing, or hope to pursue in the future.
  
** Learn more about packaging and contribute to the MOTU team
** Continue providing support on Ubuntu Forums
** I would like to apply for Ubuntu membership once I believe I have built a solid body of work within the Ubuntu community
** Re-awaken the Alabama loco team...

=== Testimonials ===

* Tim Sharitt is a valuable member of the Beginners Team and has recently volunteered to be come further involved in the education focus group. While shy about his contributions and achievements in the community I believe he is a valuable member of the community and support his application for membership. - <nowiki>[[Vantrax]]</nowiki>

* Tim is a fantastic member of the Beginners Team, and though I don't often speak with him (time zones are a pain), he seems very helpful and more knowledgeable than he thinks. I would have no hesitation in recommending him for Ubuntu membership, as I think he fully deserves it. Tim's work with the beginners team alone should be enough for membership, and I hope he continues his hard work. <nowiki>[[Joeb454]]</nowiki>

* I know Tim Sharitt both by his posts on the Ubuntu Forums as well as his participation on the Beginners Team. He is knowledgeable and conscientious. <nowiki>[[BodhiZazen]]</nowiki>
 
* I was first aware of Tim from his postings on the forums - I was always pleased to read them for their content and attitude to helping others. Since becoming a member of the UFBT he has become a valuable member of the team, his level headed attitude and consistency is welcome in it's sincerity and I hope he continues to contribute to both the forum and the beginners team - I believe him to be a valuable member of the greater community and support him in his application for membership. <nowiki>[[forestpixie]]</nowiki>
