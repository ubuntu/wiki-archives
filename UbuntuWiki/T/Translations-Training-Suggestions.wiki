== Training Suggestions ==

Translations are a vital part of l10n and i18n and our aim is to deliver Ubuntu in every user's native language with the help of community. In order to be able to do this we need everyone's help.

Making translations is an easy way to contribute and it doesn't require programming knowledge, just a good working knowledge of English. But even people willing to be translators need a little help at the beginning to get them started.

We are looking for people willing to provide this kind of help that is to prepare and lead training sessions for new translators in IRC.

Is there anything you would like to see covered in one of our next translations training session?
