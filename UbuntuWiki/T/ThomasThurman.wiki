=== About me ===

I've been using Linux since 1997 (and other Unix-likes before that). I started with Slackware, dallied briefly with Red Hat, before switching to Debian at the turn of the century when I coloed a server. After running Debian on my desktop and then a laptop for several years, I made the switch to Ubuntu and haven't looked back. (Even that server is now running dapper, though it's out of my hands now.)

I'm the upstream maintainer for fast-user-switch-applet, and one of the upstream maintainers for metacity. Because of this, I want to help out more with the Ubuntu desktop team.
