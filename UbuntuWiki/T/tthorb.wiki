I love Ubuntu, and will try to help with testing Ubuntu on a couple of laptops.

I have tried dapper drake flight 6 on <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LaptopTestingTeam/DellInspiron510m|Dell Inspiron 510m]]</nowiki>. The result is amazing. Dapper Drake is quicker than his breezy predecessor, to change network has become a pure joy and the search panel have made me all other ways to open a window. Now its <Alt-F3> all the way to the terminal!
