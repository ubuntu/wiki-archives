== Hello All! ==

Hello! You've probably seen me on the ubuntuforums.org, although i have been MIA lately...
Well, I plan on opening my calendar, and am parking this space for what's to come.
Currently, I am involved in the Creole (Haitian) translation of Ubuntu in Launchpad and working on an icon set.
Look for more activity as time passes!

Until then,
Orevwa! (Goodbye in creole ;) )
