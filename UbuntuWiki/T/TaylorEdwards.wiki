=== About Me ===
I am new to Ubuntu and a new recruit to the <nowiki>[[UtahTeam]]</nowiki>.  I'm still learning but I enjoy it.  I am 15 years old and was introduced to Linux and Ubunutu from team leader Christer who is also my older brother.  I happy to be able to be a part of this and I hope I can help do my job.
