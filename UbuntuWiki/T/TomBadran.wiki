__TOC__

I'm a freelance software developer who tries to help out with the BugSquad team as often as possible. I've also made minor contributions to a few packages like bzr-gtk, and helped out in the gcc and linux kernel communities in the past.

Currently my time is split developing projects in python and django as a freelancer, some details of which can be found at http://badrunner.net and building an internet and lan gaming cetnre in Cardiff, details of which are at http://www.vertical-sync.com
