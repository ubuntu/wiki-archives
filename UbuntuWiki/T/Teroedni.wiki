== Hello:) ==

I believe that the biggest fact holding Linux back is the lack of documentation.
Linux is a great os,and you can do hatever you want with it.

However i find the documentation often to be little or far to developer sentric(Difficult)

== What i want to do ==
I believe that we need to create more and much easier documentation, which normal people can read and understand without getting a headache.

The most important in such documenting is that the page should maximum be on two pages and be  very easy explained:)

Im a member of Gwos and Ubuntu wiki and are doing my best to contribute to thoose two. 

== Where i am ==
I often hang out at Frenodeserver
