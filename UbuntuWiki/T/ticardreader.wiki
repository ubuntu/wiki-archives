=== Summary ===

Enable the interrupt on Texas Instruments internal card readers at startup.

=== Rationale ===

The driver is already included in the kernel, but it is useless without the interrupt enabled.  It is possible for the user to enable it by hand using a "sudo setpci" command, but this should be automated.

=== Use cases ===

* Jim wants to use his 6-in-1 card reader on his new laptop.  He inserts an SD card and expects his computer to automatically detect and mount it, but instead, nothing happens.

=== Scope ===

This spec could either require a patch to the kernel to enable the interrupt within the driver, or an init script that automatically detects the busid of the card reader and sets it up for use.

=== Design ===

Currently, the user must use "sudo setpci -s '<busid>' 4c.b=0x02" to enable the interrupt.

=== Implementation ===

If implemented as an init script, we would need some way of determining the busid of the card reader if one is present.
