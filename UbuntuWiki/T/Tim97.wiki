My name is Tim and I've been messing with computers since about 1996.  I really excelled in building computers and building websites and so on.  I now work in banking in the IT dep.  I love to work with Linux although I am not a programmer.  I like the fact that Linux is freely available unlike another operating systems I know of.  I am really excited about this Edubuntu distribution since I have three young boys that need all the help they can get.  I hope I can help make the Edubuntu product better as my boys and I discover all there is to know about Edubuntu.
