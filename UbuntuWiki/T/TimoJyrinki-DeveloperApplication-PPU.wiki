== Who I am ==

I'm a Finnish free software lover somewhere above 30 years of age. I'm a SUSE user since 1997 and Ubuntu user since Ubuntu 4.10 beta. I founded Ubuntu Finland in 2005, became Debian Developer in 2008 and I'm currently working as a contractor for Canonical. I also used to be active in Openmoko community, and I've been the press representative for Finnish Wikipedia for almost 10 years. I'm also part of the FSFE's Finland branch.

== My Ubuntu story ==

I got involved because of the 'human' marketing when Ubuntu was released. I started by the interest of getting Finnish translations of Ubuntu into better shape. I've liked getting that part fixed ever since.

I like polishing packaging, and fixing any bug that seems technically minor but aesthetically major. I could probably do better by blogging more of what I've done, since my social media usage is quite sporadic.

=== My involvement ===

Packages in Debian: http://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=timo@debian.org

Ubuntu sponsored packages from me: http://ubuntu-dev.alioth.debian.org/cgi-bin/ubuntu-sponsorships.cgi?render=html&sponsor=&sponsor_search=name&sponsoree=*Timo*Jyrinki*&sponsoree_search=name

=== Examples of my work / Things I'm proud of ===

I'm proud of many of my past work, but more recently I'm proud of the Unity stack SRU's, my contribution to the daily release smoothness and the Qt 5 initial packaging contributed and done in co-operation with Debian.

=== Areas of work ===

Before the daily release process it used to be Unity stack SRUs/packaging/testing together with Compiz/Indicators/Unity teams. At the end we had a very polished/trustworthy process, although naturally far from daily release effectiveness.

Then Qt 5 started to be maybe the major area where I've worked with Debian's pkg-kde team and any team on Ubuntu side wanting something patched in a Qt module. I've also been involved with the SDK team and their Qt usage and Qt Creator efforts. Those co-operations have went well, and I'm very happy how little delta there is between Debian and Ubuntu.

In addition to Qt, as part of the daily release vanguards, I occasionally interact with all Canonical upstream teams when there's a problem in some stack identified by the system. That was a bit hard in the beginning, since one needs to know the right people from all of the teams.

For the initial PPU packages, Qt Creator is a huge work area, but that's why I'd like to have the PPU to help the SDK team fixing them. We're now separating the plugin properly from QtC itself, which should help in the pace of fixing. The git snapshot Qt modules have a good bug situation, but could use some polishing outside of the main Qt modules.

I added also the official Qt modules to the list (and I'm in pkg-kde on Debian side), and additionally a portion of the cu2d packages having QML plugins.

=== Things I could do better ===

I could do triple-checking more before pushing the button, and I've been improving on that. The main thing that has improved it has been various check lists I've around. Even though some things I can do in my dreams, there are so many little details in various aspects of eg. packaging that I've found it more trustworthy to have check lists in addition to intuition.

== Plans for the future ==
=== General ===

Continue to keep Qt 5 in sync with Debian. Get 14.04 LTS polished.

=== What I like least in Ubuntu ===

Perceived performance in some cases. Unity8 should largely fix it, ie. the '60 fps everywhere' which is what I'd want. Unity7 is nice, functional and usable but is not perceivably as smooth everywhere as it could be.

Then on the other perceived side my main wish is the smooth boot / login / logout / shutdown - no flashes, smooth transitions/animations, no hickups. Bug <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/oem-priority/+bug/967229|#967229]]</nowiki> hopefully gets fixed soon at least.

==== General feedback ====
Timo does a wonderful job keeping the !QtCreator and general Qt bits in shape, works with upstream, knows his way around, knows the processes, gets things done. In short: he's an absolute joy to work with and I trust his judgement 100%.

=== Sebastien Bacher (seb128) ===

I've been interacting with Timo regularly since he joined the Ubuntu Desktop Team, doing some reviews and sponsoring for his work. He's doing good work, interacting with his upstreams and Debian when he can. He also knows when to ask questions and is careful with uploads (getting things tested by other peoples in ppa when the change has enough impact that it should get extra testing). His work has been solid so +1 from me for ppu rights to this set.

=== Didier Roche (didrocks) ===

If you use ubuntu desktop or ubuntu touch, there is a great chance that Timo touched more than one package that you have installed. He learnt months after months, and became more and more rigorous on the work he has done. I sponsored for him the whole Qt5 stack, which is a huge and complex world (as you can see by the number of packages that are part of all those components). He is as well proactively driving any Qt transitions with the different upstreams we have using that version and discuss with Debian as well as the Kubuntu guys. He's as well the "ubuntu SDK" stackholder and coordinator, working again actively with upstream and trying to make issues resolved as fast as possible by facilitating the communication. In addition to that, he's as well involved in reviewing the packaging diff of our automatically generated and uploaded packages (the daily release ones). Nowdays, I had very few times to point something he didn't notice himself. I trust him to still ask in case of any wondering/questions he may have before uploading, and consequentely, giving him a huge +1 on the PPU rights.
