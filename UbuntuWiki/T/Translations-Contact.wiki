== Contacting the Ubuntu Translations community ==

Here are the ways in which you can reach the global Ubuntu Translations community. Our preferred way of contact is the <nowiki>[[#UbuntuTranslators|Ubuntu Translators mailing list]]</nowiki>, but there are many other ways to get in touch with us or to follow what's happening in the translations world.

=== Mailing lists ===

==== General discussion ====
<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/IconEnvelope.png|Mailing list|align="left"]]</nowiki> The mailing list is the place where all discussion and announcements should take place. You can read the online archive of the list, or you can subscribe to the list and get involved in the development of Ubuntu localization or internationalization.

==== Ubuntu Translations Coordination ====

<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/IconEnvelope.png|Mailing list|align="left"]]</nowiki> We try to provide a transparent coordination process.

* Involved technical questions on internationalization
