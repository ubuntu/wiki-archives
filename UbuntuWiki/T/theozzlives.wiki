Well this page used to be full of info. I've been testing pre-release versions of Ubuntu since 8.04. I've been helping people in the forums (most times 10+ hours/day) since 11/2007. I've been using Ubuntu since 9/2007.

I've tried to make my business a partner, I've tried to become a moderator, I've tried to become a member, I've even tried to get the Oklahoma LoCo active in promoting Ubuntu. All my efforts were in vain so now I'm just gonna enjoy my free OS and only go to the forums when I'm very bored and only install Ubuntu on a customers machine when absolutely necessary.
