=== About Me ===

My name is Tanjim Hossain and live in Dhaka, Bangladesh. I love tinkering with electrical stuffs, programming and helping the open-source community. I was introduced to Ubuntu in early 2012 by a junior of my elder brother and currently admin of <nowiki>[[https://www.facebook.com/groups/ubuntubd/|Ubuntu Bangladesh (LoCo)]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[https://www.facebook.com/bdlinux/|Bangladesh Linux User Aliance (BLUA)]]</nowiki>.

=== Contributions ===

I was accepted as admin of <nowiki>[[https://www.facebook.com/groups/ubuntubd/|Ubuntu Bangladesh]]</nowiki> fb group by <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Russell|russell john]]</nowiki>. I always try my best to help anyone with linux related problems there and also on the IRC channel ( #ubuntu-bd ). I've successfully convened many friends and relatives of mine to switch to Ubuntu. We ( Ubuntu Bangladesh ) arrange meetings, events and release parties to keep the LoCo group active and spread Ubuntu.

Tanjim has been with Ubuntu Bangladesh for few years now, as one for the most active helpers on our Facebook support group. My observation is that he spends most of his time helping fellow Ubuntu users, and sometimes I wonder when he sleeps! He was promoted as a group admin on his 18th birthday due to his dedication, and now he also helps us to maintain the group, keep it spam-free and enforcing the group rules. Being involved with various LUGs for nearly 15 years now, I must say Tanjim is one of the most dedicated volunteers I've ever come across. I wish him all the best and wholehearted support him if he chooses to apply for Ubuntu Membership. Keep up the good work!
