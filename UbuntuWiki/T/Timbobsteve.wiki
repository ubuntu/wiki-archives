__TOC__

=== Background ===

I am an avid computer user. I am currently employed as a technical support officer (YAY for Tech Support - sigh). I have been using Linux on and off for about 12 years, but have only been experimenting with Ubuntu for one year (Xubuntu x86/PPC and Ubuntu PPC). I am also looking at contributing something back to the Ubuntu community and would like to be involved in development and releases of Ubuntu in the future.

=== Hardware ===
I own four systems:

* Apple ibook G3 900 MHz    -- Running Ubuntu PPC 6.10 Edgy Eft (Main dev machine)
* Dell Latitude C600 800Mhz -- Running Windows 2000             (wifes)
* AMD64 2800                -- Running Windows XP               (for gaming)
* Custom P2 400 MHz         -- Running Xubuntu 6.06             (DHCP Server/Router/NAT)

=== Talents ===
Not much :P

* Just starting to learn C++ coding and Game Design.
* Would like to learn more about Ubuntu development and possibly contribute back to the community.
