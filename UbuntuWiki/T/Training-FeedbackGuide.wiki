== Ubuntu Desktop Section Reviews ==

=== To get started, please refer to: ===
https://code.launchpad.net/~canonical-training/ubuntu-desktop-course/ubuntu-desktop-course-beta 
and view sections 1 & 2 of the 7.10 desktop course.

A step by step guide for setting up a local branch is found in the <nowiki>[[Training/KnowledgeBase]]</nowiki>

==== When providing comments, please: ====

* Provide comments as a new branch - Branch from ubuntu-desktop-course-beta and make your changes. Please push your updated branch to Launchpad. If possible, commit after fixing one issue and send the branch name and revision number to inspect to this list.

* Look at the TOC and the approximate time each section should take to cover in class. Remember this is an instructor led course, time is precious and lots of ground to cover so only key elements should be included. 

* Note that section 2 - comparison of MS Windows with Ubuntu was especially tricky so we would appreciate some non-slating amendments to that :)

==== Bear in mind that the target audience is: ====

* A home or corporate desktop user
 
* Never used Ubuntu before and probably isn't too thrilled about using any flavour of Linux so we need to make this course as light as possible.

==== Formatting: ====

* Suggest turning it into a PDF to proof read

* Don't pay too much attention to format, we are still seeking help with XSLT. Any volunteers welcome.

==== Timing: ====

* Please can I have any and all comments made as a separate branch by close of play on '''Sunday 30th September'''. Any submissions after that will not be reviewed.

'''Have fun!'''
