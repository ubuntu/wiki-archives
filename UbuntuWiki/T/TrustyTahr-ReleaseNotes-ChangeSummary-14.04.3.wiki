__TOC__


This is a brief summary of bugs fixed between Ubuntu 14.04.2 and 14.04.3.  '''This summary covers only changes to packages in ''__main__'' and ''__restricted__'', which account for all packages in the officially-supported CD images; there are further changes to various packages in ''universe'' and ''multiverse''.'''  Some of these fixes were by Ubuntu developers directly, while others were by upstream developers and backported to Ubuntu.  For full details, see the individual package changelogs.

In addition to the bugs listed below, this update includes all security updates from the <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/trusty|Ubuntu Security Notice list]]</nowiki> affecting Ubuntu 14.04 LTS that were released up to and including August 5, 2015.  The last update included was USN-2705-1 (Keystone vulnerabilities).

=== Installation bug fixes ===

Updated CD images are provided with this release, including fixes for some installation bugs.  (Many installation problems are hardware-specific; for those, see "Hardware support bugs" below.)
