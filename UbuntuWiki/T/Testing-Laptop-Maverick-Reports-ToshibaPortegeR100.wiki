Tests

Ubuntu 10.04 works reasonably well, with either the vesa or the trident X.org driver
The installation can be a bit tricky because booting from USB is not supported (the same is true for Windows). 

I could not get 10.10 to work - the screen stays dark.

The best hardware update is more memory, followed by using a CF card as a SSD.  The CF card is very slow in the PC-Card slot, but works reasonably well in the hard disk bay (you will need an adapter, because the connector fits, but is subtly different).
