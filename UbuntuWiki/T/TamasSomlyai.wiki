I'm a 21 years old student from Hungary. I've been using Linux since 2004, and just switched from Mandrake to Kubuntu, wich I really like beacause of the strong community. I'm also working as a journalist, my main subject is mobile devices, PDAs, Mobile phones and Notebooks. I currently own an Apple Mac Mini, but I'm part of the Ubuntu Laptop Testing Team with a Canonical supplied Dell Latitude D810 machine.

I'm mainly active on the Ubuntuforums laptop section, and trying to help out others using my experience with mobile devices.
