=== Selecting Direct Install ===

Direct install utilises Ubiquity (the livecd installer) but without the need to run the full desktop.  This means it requires less memory to run and you get the system installed faster.

=== How to start ===

** Select a Language (not everyone speaks English)
** Select '''Install Ubuntu''' from the following menu.  That's it Ubiquity will now fire up.
