Meeting 2012-02-20:
* Chair: Martin Pitt
* Attendees: Stephane Graber, Soren Hansen
* Guests: Jono Bacon, Michael Hall, Allison Randal
* Full log: http://ubottu.com/meetingology/logs/ubuntu-meeting/2012/ubuntu-meeting.2012-02-20-21.08.moin.txt

* Action review:
** Kees to perform brainstorm review → dropped this cycle, next one will already be in March
** Laney and wendar to get trademark policy updated wrt remixes → done, see bug Bug:933187 (website will be updated soon, already changed internally)

* Can an ARB exception be made allowing Scopes packages to depend on Lens packages in extras (Michael Hall)
** Lenses/scopes stretch the original idea of the Extras repository a bit, but the ARB considers them appropriate content.
** Introducing dependencies into extras will require the ARB to now perform dependency checks and makes it harder to remove software: they will need to remove reverse dependencies as well, introduce automatic reports for consistency checks, i. e. introduce the need for distro-like archive management.
** An alternative proposal was made to only use Recommends: and ensure that scope packages will behave gracefully if the corresponding lens disappears. This was deemed to be violating the spirit of the extras repository policy and a workaround.
** '''Resolution:''' Let the ARB decide if they are willing to do the extra work introduced by allowing this particular case of dependency. The TB will then decide about a proposed amendment to https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ExtensionRepositoryPolicy .
