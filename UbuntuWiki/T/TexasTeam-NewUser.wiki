== Getting Started in Texas ==
* Look for a region
** Texas is big state. Okay, Texas is a '''REALLY''' big state. So obviously this hampers our ability to organize as a state on a regular basis. So what we have decided to do is organize into '''regional teams'''. A regional Team is really just code for "People within driving distance to each other".
** Here are the current Regional Teams (activity may vary!, see-> '''Don't panic''')
*** If none of those teams fit your location, you may want to try and organize your own regional group.
* '''Communicate'''
** '''Subscribe''' to the <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-us-tx|US-TX mailing list]]</nowiki>, everyone in the state should use it.
** Pop into IRC you're regional team may have it's own channel, it may not; Either way #ubuntu-us-tx is a good place for you to start.
* '''Don't panic'''
** TexasTeam isn't very well established, though we've existed a long while. Give people time and be patient. If you are motivated enough, don't be afraid to start your own regional groups and do your own thing.
