=== Ubuntu Beginners Team ===
Back in 2008/2009 I was very active on the Ubuntu Beginners Team. I was on several teams which included the IRC and Wiki/Documentation focus groups. Through my time on the Ubuntu Beginners Team, I developed several different tutorials. These included how to set up GPG on Ubuntu. When I moved in middle 2009 I lost my connection with the Ubuntu Beginners team. During that time I have introduced Fedora and snort IDS to my knowledge base. 

I am currently running Fedora 14 on my one laptop. This system is used as part of my snort IDS system. I am hoping to improve this by adding a honeypot and other security tools. 

=== Future Plans ===
* Re-Develop college senior project (Inventory Tracking Service)
* Create more tutorials for Ubuntu and Fedora
* Get more involved in testing distros
* Get more involved in Linux/Ubuntu Security Teams

If you have any questions or comments about anything, feel free to contact me using one of the methods described above.
