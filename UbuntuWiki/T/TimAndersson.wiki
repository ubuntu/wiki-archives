Waddup!

I'm a member of the Canonical Ubuntu Release Management Team. I focus mostly on desktop, autopkgtest-cloud, CI, QA, and automated GUI based testing.

My username on everything (matrix, IRC, LP, salsa, etc) is andersson123. Only on github this differs, and drastically too; on that platform, you will find me under andersson1234.
