==== Community Council ====
* 2010-01-19 meeting
** no agenda item for 11 UTC meeting
** Daniel decided to take the wiki licensing item off the agenda as he can almost never make the 21 UTC time and to discuss the agenda item with mdke over email.
** Developer membership couldn't be discussed because the DMB election is not closed yet.
* ~universe-contributors is not administered by the CC, so the decision was moved to the TB
