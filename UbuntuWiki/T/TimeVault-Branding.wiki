__TOC__

== Current TimeVault Branding ==

=== As shipped in the 0.7.0 package available on Launchpad ===

Standard icon:

<nowiki>[[File:mobeus32x32.png]]</nowiki>

Snapshot pending icon:

<nowiki>[[File:pending.png]]</nowiki>

Reconnect to daemon icon:

<nowiki>[[File:reconnect.png]]</nowiki>

At the moment the tray icons are not very helpful for people with dark backgrounds in their systray (Ubuntu Studio theme users etc).

I propose the clock faces in the pending icon should be made opaque and have their colour change to the default Ubuntu theme systray colour. A border of the same colour might be appropriate round the arrow on the reconnect icon too. 

=== Slightly re-designed Wed 18th July 2007 ===

Snapshot pending Icon:

<nowiki>[[File:pending_new.png]]</nowiki>

Reconnect to daemon icon:

<nowiki>[[File:reconnect_new.png]]</nowiki>

It may not be immediately obvious on here but the changes include, filling in the clock-faces on the pending icon in white and drawing a line round the arrow on the reconnect icon. They do look slightly better on a dark background but seem to look relatively unchanged on a light background (which is the desired effect).

They are pretty rough though and could definitely benefit from the attention of someone who knows what they're doing at some point.
