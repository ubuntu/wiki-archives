=== About ===
Hi, I'm known online as Thomas de Graaff, which happens to be my real name. My first computer experience I got playing with a Apple II clone when I was about 11 years old. My first encounter with (Red Hat) Linux must have been around 1999, but it couldn't convince me to stop using MacOS on my first generation iMac. Soon thereafter I needed Windows at university doing CAD stuff designing architecture, and I continued using Windows. I came to Ubuntu as a typical end user when Ubuntu Feisty Fawn (7.04) was released. I had some trouble getting it to work on my laptop, and got immediately hooked by the OS and the helpful community.

Recently I got <nowiki>[[http://www.thomasdegraaff.nl/drupal/?q=node/58|LPI 1 certified]]</nowiki>, this I taught myself. 

My contributions to the Ubuntu community are mainly in the area of Ubuntu promotion.

==== Present ====
* I am fulfilling my duties as a member of the Ubuntu-NL governance, the Ubuntu-NL board, and the Ubuntu-NL foundation. Furthermore I'm a member of the promotion team, and as such am still involved in the organization of events (although I have put my contributions in this area on a low level until the Ubuntu-NL foundation is a fact).

==== Future ====
* I plan to keep on contributing to the Ubuntu community. More specifically I hope to contribute to successful festivities in the Netherlands celebrating the 12.04 LTS release. It amazed me in the past to see what the effort of many hands can achieve, and I hope the 12.04 release will continue to do so. :) In the near future I really look forward to the day when we put our signatures on the founding papers of the "Stichting ondersteuning Ubuntu-NL", this foundation will be of great practical help to the community.

=== Testimonials ===
* Thomas has been absolutely essential for Ubuntu Nederland. Currently he is mostly active in the leadership of the LoCo, more or less pulling the chart. In the past he was a vital part of the team that organized the events and he still contributes a lot there. I am amazed that Thomas didn't become Ubuntu Member sooner, because he absolutely deserves it. -- <nowiki>[[SenseHofstede]]</nowiki>

* I know Thomas de Graaff as '''the spinning wheel''' behind the most successful Ubuntu Release Parties in the Netherlands. He was the person who set the parties in motion and find the right people so everything went smoothly. Thomas has been <nowiki>[[http://ubuntunl.sehofstede.nl/election/1/Ubuntu%20Nederland%20verkiezingen%202011/results/|elected]]</nowiki> for our local Ubuntu governance and board. He is a '''born leader''' who manages the meetings very well. Even for the more boring activities like writing the meeting reports you won't hear him complaining. Thomas is not only very successful in arranging meetings, release parties etc, but he is also '''a very nice person to work with'''. Always polite, social, interested in the project people work on, both on line and off line. I am confident that Thomas will stay actively involved in our community for quite some time. '''Thomas your awesome!''' -- <nowiki>[[ronnie.vd.c]]</nowiki>
 
* I strongly support his application for Ubuntu membership. He deserves this very, very much. -- <nowiki>[[leoquant]]</nowiki>

* I know Thomas de Graaff since a few years. He is an enthusiastic Ubuntu-supporter and shows it with his actions. He attends a lot, and organizes a few Ubuntu-Release-parties and can also be found on other events where Ubuntu is. He is also heavily involved in our local Ubuntu board. -- <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~programming|ertai]]</nowiki>

* Since my involvement with Ubuntu NL I had to deal with !ThomasTheGrave (loosely translated). At that time he was especially active as organisator of release parties and other IRL events concerning the promotion of the Ubuntu OS. I've seen/spoke/work with him on some of the events and he is an entusiastic person when it comes to getting thins done. Nowadays he is a value member of the so called dutch (Ubuntu) governance/board. Thereby I wholeheartedly endorse Thomas for Ubuntu Membership, he deserves this acknowledgement. -- <nowiki>[[RachidBM]]</nowiki> 2011-10-03

* For two years I know Thomas de Graaff, and I am surprised that he's not an Ubuntu member yet. Thomas is not only an organiser and active in the LoCo board, but he is also a reference point and an advocate of reasonability in many discussions. Thomas absolutely deserves this. -- <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~robin4mailbox|asphyxia]]</nowiki>
