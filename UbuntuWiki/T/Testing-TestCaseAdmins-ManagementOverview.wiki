== Playing in a sandbox ==
Before you edit data in the production system, you are encouraged to play around on the staging instance. You are free to play around and get your bearings by using <nowiki>[[http://packages.qa.dev.stgraber.org/|this instance]]</nowiki>. Please try out these actions there before editing production data.

== Testcase Formats ==
Testcases should follow our <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/TestCaseFormat|established formats]]</nowiki>. 

=== Overview ===
The qatracker works by allowing us to define products that we want to test. Each product has a way to report bugs, downloads, or installation instructions. These are managed in the qatracker.

Now, each product also has one or more testsuites attached to it. A testsuite is a set of testcases. By maintaining this relationship, we can reuse the testcases in many different testsuites. This allows for specific testcases for flavors or sharing tests across architectures.

=== Getting logged in ===
* Login to the tracker
* Click the administration link

<nowiki>[[File:adminlink.png]]</nowiki>

If your a member of the team, you should have access.

=== Adding a testcase ===
* Ensure the testcase your adding is in one of the formats above (this can be ignored for an initial conversion from a legacy testcase, but we eventually need to get all testcases in this format :-) )
* Click the Testcases tab across the top

<nowiki>[[File:testcases.png]]</nowiki>

* Click the add a testcase link at the top
* Fill in the form. You can ignore the ID field (it will autogenerate), and the link field (it's used for legacy testcase support). Fill in a name, and your testcase in the text box below.

* Click save

=== Editing a testcase ===
* Click the Testcases tab across the top
* Select the testcase you wish to edit, and click the edit link on the right hand side
* Edit the text and name, but be sure to not change the id

* Click save

=== Adding the testcase to a testsuite ===
* Click the Testsuite tab across the top
 <nowiki>[[File:testsuitetab.png]]</nowiki>
* Click the edit button next to the testsuite you wish to add the testcase to
* Fill out the fields at the bottom to add the testcase. All fields are required. The status field allows you to make the test mandatory (always need to be run), run-once, or disabled. This should be set to mandatory unless otherwise noted. Setting the field to disabled effectively removes the testcase from the suite, and it will not be displayed. Finally, the weight allows you to control the order the tests are listed in. Typically unless order is important, this is left as a 0 for all testcases.

* Click add and the new testcase should be displayed in the table

=== Adding a testsuite to a product ===
This is the final step to getting your testcase to show up on the tracker. Fortunately, an admin must complete this piece of the puzzle. Once your tests are in a testsuite, you can let the admin know to add it to the specific product for testing. This sounds more confusing than it is, and know that if you find yourself needing this step, someone else should be there to help.
