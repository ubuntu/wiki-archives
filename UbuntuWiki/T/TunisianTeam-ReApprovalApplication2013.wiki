=== Roadmap ===

* ''Supporting the new team members of FLOSS club FreeMind'' - at the higher institute of computer science and communication techniques of hammam sousse.
* ''Software Freedom Day''
* ''Ubuntu Release Party 13.10''
* ''Ubuntu Global Jam 13.09'' - We are planning more advanced contributions in larger number of participants for next Ubuntu Global Jams as the team members now have more technical experience with packaging and bug triagging activities. Our next challenge is to actually have some involved in each Ubuntu development cycle.
* ''IRL National Meeting'' - Our community is in need of a new national meeting to reactivate members in most of the cities and increase the number of new active members. This is planned for the next two to three months.
* ''Ubuntu classrooms'' - organize more classrooms to improve team skills in different field and involve more members in Ubuntu contribution.
* ''Partnership with some FLOSS NGOs and broaden Ubuntu-TN activity'' - Activites and events for universities and schools will continue. But our next challenge is to reach more the non-academic public.
* ''Youth events'' - Our new challenge is to offer the alternative to young people at their early age so they have the choice of freedom. We are planning to reach a much younger public.
* ''Ubuntu-TN T-Shirts'' - produce ubuntu-TN T-Shirts and more ubuntu material such as stickers.
* ''Increase active FF members'' - FF members are the heart of our team! they are the members who do most of the job and make the community more active and productive. We have been already working on increasing the number of this team members and we are planning to reach at least twice the number of Current FF members before 2014.
* ''Introduce new types of events'' - such as development events, cooperating with other communities and teams, national and international events. This is not on the roadmap for this year yet. It should be planned for fall 2013 or for 2014.
* ''Produce the first release of Ubuntu-TN magazine'' - This is planned to be done soon this year, the magazin then will be released quarterly.
* ''More cooperation with other communities'' - More cooperation with other teams and communities from other countries may be planned for 2014.

=== Achivements ===

Our team have been able to achive all the goals of our last roadmap and even more then expected.

* ''Activity diversity'' - The team was able to introduce new types of activities such as release parties, Flash caffee, Ubuntu Global Jam and new National and International events.
* ''Supporting other FLOSS clubs and communities'' - During last years we have supported the launch of many new FLOSS club around the country and worked and collaborated with other clubs and communities.
* ''Team skills improvement'' - not only we have planned Ubuntu Global Jam, actually we started teaching new skills such as packaging and bug triagging in Tunisia, now we have many members who are familiar with different activities of Global Jam and can do more advanced contribution. Members also benefit from the days spent together to share experience, build more relationship and join new members to the team. We are expecting to be able to share a good experience with other teams soon.
* ''New LoCo structure'' - The new coordination team and new active members have been able to keep the community up an running with the appropriate new community structure. Even though this structure worked well, it is still not perfect yet, so new improvements will be coming as needed.
* ''Ubuntu-TN website'' - The community managed to finish Ubuntu-TN website and managed to sponsor the domain name and webhost. Yet the website is still in beta testing and new improvements would be expected.
