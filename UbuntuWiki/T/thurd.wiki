=== Background ===
I started programming with high school courses in C++ and Java.  I recently graduated from University of Maryland, College Park with a B.S. in Computer Science.  I began using Linux with Ubuntu 6.06 and I've been hooked ever since.<<BR>>

I enjoy programming in C, Java, and Python.

=== Future Activity ===
I am currently jumping in to the Ubuntu Community and hopefully you'll see me submitting patches soon!
