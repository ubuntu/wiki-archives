__TOC__

I'm an Italian student in maths.

Since I found wonderful Ubuntu the first time I installed it (Breezy, I'm quite a Linux newbye), I thought my way to say thanks was allowing testing releases to mess up my computer, make buttons disappear and others appear in an unpredictable way... after you take the abitude, it's funny.
