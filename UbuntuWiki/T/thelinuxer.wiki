== About Me ==

My name is Ahmed Toulan. I live in Cairo Egypt. I started out as a cross platform C/C++ developer, 
and that got me hooked with Qt. Currently I am working as a web developer using Python and Django.
I started using Redhat in year 2001, then decided to be more hardcore so I switched to Slackware. After having all the fun that I can get and deciding to do some real work Ubuntu was my distro of choice. I am an active member of the <nowiki>[[http://wiki.ubuntu.com/EgyptTeam|Ubuntu-EG]]</nowiki> LoCo team.

I have been working with Ubuntu-eg since 2009 and had such a great time with the team since then.
