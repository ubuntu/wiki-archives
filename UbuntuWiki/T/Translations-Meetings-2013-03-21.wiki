== Meeting Agenda ==
* Log of the Last meeting with the community council : http://irclogs.ubuntu.com/2012/12/20/%23ubuntu-meeting.html#t17:00

Action items and topics raised:
* open up a little bit the ubuntu-translation-coordinators team 
* bring the statistics page back online
* a little exposure (planet) could help attract some new folks (take over what dpm was doing)
* implementing fuzzy in lp
* fixing the timeout
* opening raring early
* making sure the upstream translations are imported quickly to avoid duplication
* popcon sorting of ddtp

Items proposed for this time

* Review the <nowiki>[[Translations-Meetings-ToDo|TODO list]]</nowiki>
* Grant access to the Trello to more people
* Actualize the Translations/KnowledgeBase (many outdated pages)
* Spreading the word on translations (Get access to all social media accounts, and get a voice on the Planet)
* Google Summer of Code project ? (Can we propose LP projects (the LP bug) ? Or better integrate web and desktop apps to let users propose translations for descriptions/programs)
* Evaluate change of processes to ensure quality within a rolling release system
* Syncing the DDTP with Debian (we report mistakes already fixed upstream) (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ddtp-ubuntu/+bug/1106174)
* Ensure the Software Center gets the DDTP translations (doesn't seem to be the case right now)
* Sorting the DDTP by popularity (greater visible impact of our work) alphabetically (would enable mass validation of similar strings) (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ddtp-ubuntu/+bug/1085379)
* The infamous Launchpad bug: having the LP devs to give us an overview or blueprint of the work required to solve it. (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ddtp-ubuntu/+bug/869824)
* Review the language pack situation and process and document them
* Review the community page
