=== Roadmap Notes ===

===== Overview of this document =====

Here we should list the things we want to do with the group. Instead of just listing ideas, it is always good to say who will be working on what items. As such, before we submit our application, we will need to have a consensus amongst group members and look for volunteers to nominate themselves to work on specific items. This always goes in favour of the group. Again, provide links to web pages and archives where relevant.

===== Notes =====
