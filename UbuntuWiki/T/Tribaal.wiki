=== About Me ===

I'm an Ubuntu user since about 2005 (Breezy), after playing with Debian for years, and GNU/Linux for even longer.

I currently hold a software engineer position with Canonical, in the Ubuntu Foundations team, after working in the Landscape team for several years. 

My position in the Landscape team allowed me to help develop the server, cloud and openstack side of the whole Canonical offering. The focus of my work was making the code for both the client and the server as transparent and reliable as possible, with extra emphasis on readability and testing. The client is part of the default Ubuntu CD, and so a special attention is always necessary.

In the foundations team, I focus on delivering cloud images to both cloud-images.ubuntu.com and some of our cloud partners requiring special considerations (special kernels, fine tuning of installed software, etc...). It also allows me to work closely with some of the core components of an Ubuntu system - grub, gcc, the various toolchains (Python, Ruby, etc...) and the build process for both Ubuntu images and the packages themselves.

Very active, I like to travel a lot, and so recently came back to my native Switzerland after living in Tanzania for some time.

Apart from being an Ubuntu fanboy, I did and still do some Django on my spare time, and I have contributed and/or started several Django related projects, such as django-shop and django-cms (both of which I was a core developer of).

I developed quite some knowledge related to self-sufficient transmission systems as well, out of necessity and interest (solar power, mesh networks, directional point-to-point transmissions...)

'''Note''': While I was a Canonical employee this is page and membership are own initiative, and is neither required nor sanctioned by my former employer. I feel that I belong as a member of the community in my own right :)

=== Future Goals ===

* Revive and dynamize LoCos around the world.
* Contribute to and improve the Ubuntu OpenStack reference architecture.
* Develop a longer series of blog post about <nowiki>[[https://tribaal.io/very-simple-debian-package.html|debian and snap packaging]]</nowiki>, as well as how to contribute to the ubuntu community in the more general sense.
* Dive deeper in the (Debian) packaging side of Ubuntu, to hopefully help make the distribution better form the bottom up.
* Dive deeper in the snap packaging side of Ubuntu to hopefully make the Ubuntu core initiative better.

Chris is an awesome colleague and developer. He pays a lot of attention to quality and if something is wrong he is eager to fix it. He feels very responsible for the code he writes and projects he maintains, so he can really be called a Maintainer. He really enjoys Ubuntu and pushes it forward anywhere he has a chance. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:ahasenack]]</nowiki> 
My interactions with Chris have been brief, however they are quality conversations. He's submit some work against Charm Helpers in an effort to clean up documentation, and add robust new features to the charming ecosystem. +1 on his review from Me -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:lazypower]]</nowiki>
