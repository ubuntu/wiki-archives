=== My History With Ubuntu ===

I've been using Ubuntu since Warty. That first install was an oldworld Mac (!PowerBook G3 Series -- !WallStreet II / PDQ) but I have branched out and have a small fleet of computers running Ubuntu Dapper 6.06.1 through the latest stable release. 

Here are my <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~tommy-trussell/+hwdb-submissions|hardware compatibility database submissions]]</nowiki> (aka info from <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/checkbox|checkbox]]</nowiki>  ): 

=== Other Info ===

I have a M.S. in Technical Communication from Rensselaer Polytechnic, and my first instinct is usually to write about it, whatever it is, and make it understandable. That way I have half a chance of remembering and/or understanding it myself. ;-)

=== Community Involvement ===

I'm a member of the Ubuntu Arkansas !LoCo team, and have been active in CARLUG (Central Arkansas Linux Users Group). Find out more about linux in Arkansas at http://www.arlug.org/

I also have been working with the folks at <nowiki>[[http://gnucash.org/|GnuCash]]</nowiki>, reading everything and sometimes responding to questions on the GnuCash mailing list and occasionally irc.

=== Programming ===

I'm not a "real" programmer, but over the years I have written a few lines in BASIC, some !HyperCard stacks, and some code in M (aka MUMPS) for various support and documentation projects. As of early 2010 I am trying to teach myself enough Scheme to scratch an itch in !GnuCash.
