I have tested this Bluetooth USB Adapter with the following OS:

1. Ubuntu v6.10 (Edgy Eft)

It seems that I can NOT make this Bluetooth Adapter work with my Ubuntu v6.10!

Note:

I performed a search from my Mobile Phone to detect available Bluetooth Devices (e.g. My USB Bluetooth Adaptor) and it did NOT find any.

== Conclusion ==

This product works great in Windows OS.

However, I could '''NOT''' put it to work on my Ubuntu v6.10 OS.

The decision is yours.

Note:
