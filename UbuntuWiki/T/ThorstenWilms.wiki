__TOC__


I'm a freelance designer from Germany and contribute in the artwork and design realm.

=== History ===

I started to use free software out of plain curiosity. Once I had Internet access, the easy and free availability, lack of license/copy-protection hassle and nobody wanting to lock my data in proprietary formats were pretty convincing. A growing interest in interface and interaction design drove me to get in contact with developers and I got to enjoy the community spirit in and around free software projects. Debian, Gentoo and now Ubuntu, as I got tired of having to configure lots of things and want to see Free Software succeed on a broad front, to the benefit of a maximum of people.

I started to design logos for free software projects in 2004. My first mail to ubuntu-art happened at the end of 2007. In 2009, I went to the UDS-L in Dallas following an invitation.

=== Contributions ===

* Providing feedback and suggestion on the artwork mailing list. Welcoming and informing newcomers about what is going on.

==== Ubuntu Customization kit ====

One step on the way and the finally chosen logo for the <nowiki>[[http://uck.sourceforge.net/|Ubuntu Customization Kit]]</nowiki>. This seems to be my earliest piece of work related to Ubuntu, starting in May, 2007:

==== Ubuntu Brainstorm ====

Nicolas Deschildre asked for a logo for the <nowiki>[[http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/|brainstorm site]]</nowiki> before it went up. Next came templates for banners and a set of icons to illustrate the process:

=== Next ===

* Continue with the title page design for the Ubuntu Manual Project.
* Investigate the use of the Google App Engine to write a tool that helps with selecting wallpapers from the Flickr pool (Flickr itself lacks features that would make this a lot easier). Afterwards consider the creation of a site that would beat the wiki for artwork contributions.
* Spread design thinking and methods.
