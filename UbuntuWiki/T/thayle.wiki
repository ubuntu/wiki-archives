=== About Me ===
I am an 18 year old freshman, currently attending <nowiki>[[http://ucsc.edu|UCSC]]</nowiki> working on a major in Computer Science: Computer Game Design. I first used Ubuntu for a little on my desktop with Hardy, however, shortly after, that desktop died. I recently purchased a new laptop, the HP Pavilion dv5-1017nr. I'm planning on installing Intrepid on it as soon as the official release comes! I hope to contribute greatly to the Ubuntu community.
