=== About ===

Hello all,

My name is Todd and I have been using Ubuntu since 2009.  I have been interested in computers for 40 years and after learning about Ubuntu, I made the switch.  I am a member of the AZ Loco Team and a member of several bug bug teams. I started with several installfests and became a regular team member and soon co-hosted installfests when others were unavailable. I then started organizing several other installfests in Tempe and Paradise Valley. In fall of 2010 I took over as Team leader and have enjoyed a slow steady growth of Azloco. I started several projects for our Team and with Team support we now have current servers wikis and test servers and just added a Big blue button server and ISO server. We have recently added an Owncloud server to our list of tools and services. We usually have two installfests every month at University of advancing Technology in Tempe, Arizona, USA and Four ubuntu hours across the State. I run weekly meetings on #ubuntu-us-az and attend other events to promote Ubuntu, Loco and pass out DVD's. I also help with other local Linux user groups, monitor IRC and help answer questions. I maintain the team mail servers and mailing lists.

=== Testimonials ===

How can I define Todd's contributions without missing anything?  That's a hard one and it will require me to think back over 5 years when The Ubuntu Arizona Local Community Team was an infant.  You see Todd has been active as long as I can remember.  After I resigned my position as Team Leader he stepped up and took over.  His efforts to help the team were then and still are substantial. As a matter of fact he has accomplished much more than I managed to.  His commitment to this LoCo and to Ubuntu is something for anyone to aspire to – he embodies The Ubuntu Code of Conduct on and off-line.  The amount of time he puts in precludes him from doing much outside the team.  His mentoring skills and his ability to attract helpful LoCo-ers has really paid off in that the team has grown not just in raw numbers but in real active participants and in Team Activities: he's even gotten me active again.  If it weren't for Todd's tireless efforts I fear for continued Team Meetings, Installfests, Release Parties, and Ubuntu Hours, and continued interaction with other LUGs in Arizona.  I know I can't demand anything on the Membership Council, but I can easily say that Ubuntu would be a better Community with him as a Member, Ambassador, and Evangelist.

I have known Todd for several years now and he is one of those exceptional people who help out, contribute and be persistent in the quest to promote and improve free software, and Ubuntu in general. I have seen many people become aware of (and interested in) the open source community and the Linux/Ubuntu alternative. I consider Todd a very good friend that helps me when needed, and goes above and beyond what could be expected from a volunteer.
