I am a fairly new Ubuntu user as of March 2007) but have been using Linux as far back as 1996 when I first downloaded and installed Linux onto my PC from the local hensa.ac.uk archive that was on my university campus at the time.

In the years since I have tried Mandrake and SuSE linux on my desktop and server PCs but finally decided to switch my desktop full time to Ubuntu with the advent of Vista.

I am currently learning to find my way around the Ubuntu community, looking to get involved with my local LUGs and otherwise trying to decide how best I can contribute to the community.
