== Trusted Platform Module ==

TPM stands for Trusted Platform Module. TPM devices have two main implementations: an older one, called TPM or TPM 1.2, which has been in use for a number of years in various applications, and a newer implementation called TPM 2, which has started to appear on many modern devices.

This document focuses only on TPM2.

=== TPM2 ===

[ describe theoretical uses for tpm2 ]

==== Using the TPM ====

Given the complexity of using a TPM, it is strongly recommended to use a resource manager (usually ''tabrmd'', or the kernel's own resource manager, if available via '''/dev/tpmrm#''')

It is also possible to use the TPM device or simulator directly as a device, see <nowiki>[[TPM-Testing]]</nowiki>

===== Starting a resource manager =====

If the resource manager isn't started automatically:

<pre>
$ sudo service tpm2-abrmd start
</pre>

Or:

<pre>
/usr/sbin/tpm2-abrmd -T device
</pre>

<pre>
/usr/sbin/tpm2-abrmd -T mssim  
</pre>

===== Listing PCRs =====

For Ubuntu 19.04 and newer:
<pre>
$ tpm2_pcrlist
</pre>

For previous releases:
<pre>
$ tpm2_listpcrs
</pre>

===== Hashing a value =====
