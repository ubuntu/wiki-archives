=== About Myself ===

Hello, I am Tyler H, aka the_hardy_kid.

I am an active member on the Ubuntu Forums, and the #ubuntuforums-beginners IRC channel.

----

I am a 13 year old "kid", and I am interested in helping anyone in anyway I can, although I cannot offer too much.
I have only been running Ubuntu Linux for a short while, but will help all.

I am running Ubuntu Hardy Heron 8.04 LTS,

=== My Contributions To The Ubuntu Community ===

Well, as yet, I have made almost no contributions.

I have, however...

* Been Active On The Forums
- I have several posts, and try to help other users with problems I have encountered.

* Been Active On IRC
- Asking a lot of questions, in order to further my knowledge of Ubuntu (and Linux).

=== Projects ===

I'm not exactly sure if this can be counted as a project, but neither-the-less it's going up.

My Personal Website (all written in HTML and CSS by myself in gedit)

=== Misc ===

I am interested in the BT (Beginners Team), and I am currently getting around to applying to be one of the team.

My ubuntuforums name is the same as it is on here, the_hardy_kid, and the same on IRC.
