==== Gimp ====

The Gimp (Gnu Image Manipulation Program) is probably one of the most powerful imaging tools available in Linux.  It is comparable to Photoshop or Paintshop Pro.

'''Tests to perform'''

** Open the Gimp.  Create a picture.  Save it.
** If you can get an image off the web or a camera try editing it.
** Play around with the tools and ensure they work in an obvious manner.
