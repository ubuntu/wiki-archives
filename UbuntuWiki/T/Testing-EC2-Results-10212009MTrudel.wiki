=== Test notes ===

* '''[1]''' Rebundle testing cannot be done without Amazon S3. Doing so seems to work, but produces a ''running'' instance that can not do anything useful.
* These tests should be automated as much as possible. Potential automation was tested with ec2-003 and ec2-003, draft test script here: <nowiki>[[https://code.edge.launchpad.net/checklist/trunk/|lp:checklist]]</nowiki>
