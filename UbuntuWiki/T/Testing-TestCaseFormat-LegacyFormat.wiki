== Testcase Formats ==
Two formats are currently recognized for use. For most testcases, the testcase should be in this form

=== Normal Testcase ===
# Perform X action
## Expect Y result
# Perform A action
## Expect B and C result
If all actions produce the expected results listed, please submit a 'passed' result.
If an action fails, or produces an unexpected result, please submit a 'failed' result and file a bug. Please be sure to include the bug number when you submit your result.

=== Smoke Testcase ===
* Question 1?
* Question 2?
* Question 3?
If you answer 'yes' to all questions, please submit a 'passed' result.
If you answer 'no' to any question, then please submit a 'failed' result and file a bug. Please be sure to include the bug number when you submit your result.
