=== Ubuntu History ===
I first heard about linux in 2006 when I bought a new MP3-player. The box mentioned that it was compatible with Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. I knew the first two very well, an the third one stayed in my mind. After some research, I found out that Linux was a Free (as in beer) operating system, and that it was open source. I already knew open source because I was using Firefox, but I couldn't imagine that an entire operating system could be developed that way. 

Some month later (it was 2007 then), I heard about Ubuntu and the LiveCD-concept, so I decided to give Ubuntu 6.10 (Edgy Eft) a spin. I was impressed, and I decided to install Ubuntu in dual-boot. However, 7.04 (Feisty Fawn) was being developed that time, and I was advised to wait until the Feisty release. During that time, I discovered KDE, and it was love at first sight, so when the moment was there, I installed Kubuntu 7.04 in a dual-boot configuration with Windows, and I stayed using it.

I also tested other dsitributions like Slax, Pardus and openSuSE, and I liked them all, but I still returned to Kubuntu due its impressive Dutch-speaking community.
Currently, I'm running Kubuntu 8.04 with KDE 4 as desktop.

==== KDE ====
I recently started with helping to translate KDE in dutch. Currently, only Kalzium and its documentation are in the SVN (part of KDE 4.0.4). My main projects for KDE 4.1 are the translation of Step and Dragonplayer with their respective documentations. I also maintain the Marble documentation and Blinken.
