* <nowiki>[[http://wiki.lxde.org/en/PCManFM | Pcmanfm]]</nowiki>, a fast and lightweight files manager using gio/gvfs.

=== System Requirements ===

A Pentium II or Celeron system with 128 MB of RAM is probably a bottom-line configuration that may yield slow yet usable system with a standard lubuntu desktop.

14.04 32 bit ISO require your CPU to have Physical Address Extensions, or PAE. "PAE is provided by Intel Pentium Pro and above CPUs, including all later Pentium-series processors (except most 400 MHz-bus versions of the Pentium M)." - If you have an error with Celeron M reporting "NON-PAE CPU" and would like to install Lubuntu 14.04, please see <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lubuntu/AdvancedMethods#Pentium_M_and_Celeron_M | this page]]</nowiki>

For <nowiki>[[PowerPC]]</nowiki>, it is known to run on a G4 running at 867MHz with 640MB RAM. 

For Intel based Macs, lubuntu should run on all models.

== Known Issues ==

=== Installation ===
* Some keyboard layouts may have problems (such as UK ones). You can workaround the problem by removing all the ibus-* packages (see Bug:1284635))

=== Graphics and Display ===

=== Applications ===
* Network indicator on the panel may not start at login. You can start it manually by launching "nm-applet" in a terminal. Some others autostarted applications may also be affected (such as automatic updates). See Bug:1308348 for the details and the ETA for the fix. To turn on nm-applet in autostart, follow <nowiki>[[http://www.webupd8.org/2014/04/fix-lubuntu-1404-network-manager.html | these instructions]]</nowiki> It may need two reboots to fully work.

=== PPC ===
* PPC has several issues and workarounds, please refer to the <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/Documentation/FAQ/PPC |documentation on the wiki]]</nowiki>.
* Slideshow on PPC Desktop ISO was removed because of a bug on webkit (Bug:996568)
* Installer on Desktop PPC (Ubiquity) is enable to resize and split partitions. you can use Gparted before launching the installation to make the modifications to your partitions (Bug:1307994)
