=== Start contributing ===

Initially, TestDrive PyGTK Front-end was developed outside the source code of testdirve. Now they are both together in one code base.

TestDrive PyGTK Front-end was initially developed using the Quickly tool, so this guide will provide steps to easily modify testdrive-gtk using quickly.

=== Setting up environment ===

First, we need to obtain the source:

<pre>
bzr branch lp:testdrive
</pre>

Setting up PYTHONPATH:

<pre>
export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/your/branch/of/testdrive
</pre>

=== Modifying files ===

<pre>
quickly edit
</pre>

=== Modifying UI Files with glade ===

<pre>
quickly design
</pre>

=== Testing the Front-end changes ===

<pre>
quickly run
</pre>

=== Testing the CLI changes ===

<pre>
python bin/testdrive
</pre>
