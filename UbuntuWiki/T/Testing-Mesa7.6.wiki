== Mesa 7.6 in Karmic Test Plan ==

Mesa 7.6 has arrived in Karmic after the beta. We need as much testing as possible to be able to revert in time if necessary.
  
=== Background ===

We've known that 7.6.0 would hit around beta time.  We decided at the outset that it was probably worth the risk, and we've been carefully tracking git snapshots of it all along. Still, given the lateness in the cycle we have had worry that any change at this brings some risk, with minimal time to recover.

=== Reporting bugs ===

In order to gather as much information as possible, file your bugs against the xorg package:

<code>ubuntu-bug xorg</code>

=== FAQ ===

==== Does this mean KMS will be available on -ati? ====

This pulls in a number of bug fixes for KMS on -ati, but does not set it as the default.  Turning it on requires a kernel parameter be set. 
You can test it by booting with the 'radeon.modeset=1' kernel option.

==== Will libdrm, -intel, or xserver be updated as well? ====

Those are unrelated to this upload and will each be evaluated separately in turn.  Those three are pretty much just bug fix releases; worst case is we can cherrypick patches from them as necessary.

==== Didn't a late-in-the-release mesa update break Jaunty? ====

No, as it turned out.  We had updated mesa right prior to when a bunch of X freeze bugs were reported, so it looked very suspicious. However, the freezes still occurred even after downgrading mesa.  In the end, the X freezes were fixed by changes in the Karmic kernel's DRM code.

==== How do I downgrade to the earlier mesa version? ====

I will be uploading the prior version to x-retro later today: <nowiki>[[https://edge.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-x-swat/+archive/x-retro]]</nowiki>

==== How do I downgrade from ppa (like xorg-edgers) ? ====

Create file /etc/apt/preferences.d/downgrade and insert:

<pre>
Package: *
Pin: origin de.archive.ubuntu.com
Pin-Priority: 1001
</pre>
replace de.archive.ubuntu.com with your update server.
remove or comment ppa source in your /etc/apt/source.list after this do:
<pre>
sudo apt-get upgrade
</pre>

==== Are even newer versions available? ====

Snapshots of the 7.7 development tree are being provided in xorg-edgers: <nowiki>[[https://edge.launchpad.net/~xorg-edgers/+archive/ppa]]</nowiki>
