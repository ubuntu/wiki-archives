__TOC__

I've participated in many projects, however the one I'm going to point out I am the proudest of. I took part in a coding academy named "Programowanie na start", which can be translated to English as "Start in programming". I've also done many language projects and I have some experience in compiling from source, as I had compiled Android from source <on Ubuntu of course ;)> and it is confirmed working by me and many other people.
