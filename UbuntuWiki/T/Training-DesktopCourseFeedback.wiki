== Ubuntu 7.10 Desktop Course ==

'''Bi-weekly meetings held: Next meeting scheduled for Thursday 23rd August, UTC+1 at #ubuntu-training.'''

With the explosive growth of Ubuntu, one of the services and products we are working towards is the production of a range of high quality training courses. These courses are designed to help get Ubuntu users trained and certified with respected, notable, high quality training courses.

As we all know, Ubuntu is deeply rooted in community, and we are very keen to work with the community on the content, structure and organisation of the training courses. Join the meetings and find out how to get involved.
