== JSON-RPC for twisted.web ==

=== Dependencies ===

* Twisted
* simplejson

=== Background ===

We needed a twisted-based JSON-RPC server for making remote calls from an AJAX app. This allowed us to change our XML-RPC server to a JSON-RPC server with a simple import change. 

Since there is no xmlrpclib equivalent for JSON-RPC, we had to make our own. It's very simple and minimal. We copied error codes and some exception classes from the <code>xmlrpclib</code> in the python standard library, and then we over-rode the <code>simplejson.loads</code> and <code>simplejson.dumps</code> methods with our own module-level functions (basically making a few additions for exception handling).

The original tests from <code>twisted.web.xmlrpc</code> were also included/adapted and pass successfully.

=== Import ===

<pre>
>>> from txjsonrpc.web import jsonrpc
</pre>

=== Usage ===

This is a direct copy from <code>twisted.web.xmlrpc</code> and you use it identically, substituting JSONRPC and jsonrpc everywhere you see XMLRPC and xmlrpc. Here's a link to the docs:
