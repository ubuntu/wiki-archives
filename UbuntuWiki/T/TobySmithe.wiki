I am an Ubuntu Member, and volunteer Ubuntu (Studio) developer. Recently, during the Hardy cycle, I have worked on getting alsa-firmware included somewhere; the somewhere ending up as being in Medibuntu. I have also packaged mscore and fluid-soundfont, and have been working on better MIDI support in Ubuntu. Both these packages are on their way into Debian.
