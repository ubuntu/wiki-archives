* Proposed changes to the release cycle
** The board discussed a few recently proposed <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/technical-board/2013-March/001527.html|changes]]</nowiki> to the release cycle
** Duration of maintenance/support
** Currently, standard (non-LTS) releases include a commitment to 18 months of maintenance
** The original proposal called for reducing the maintenance period for standard releases from 18 months to 7 months
** The development team representatives discussed the possibilities and reached a consensus on a new maintenance period of 9 months, which the board then voted to approve
** Effective release for new maintenance period
** The board voted to implement the 9-month maintenance period beginning with Ubuntu 13.04
** Providing a mechanism to easily track the development branch of Ubuntu continuously
** Currently, users must explicitly upgrade their system to each new release
** The proposal called for designating the current development focus as a "rolling release", intended to be tracked continuously rather than via discrete upgrades
** The technical requirement for such a designation would be a mechanism to enable this behavior, since it is not currently supported by our current infrastructure
** The board voted in support of the development of such a facility, without specifying a particular mechanism (TBD by the relevant development team(s))
** There were further components to the proposal which could not be discussed in the time available for the meeting. Discussion will continue at the next meeting on 2013-04-01
