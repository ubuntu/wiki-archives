== Session Notes ==

<pre>
== Translations for Firefox in Lucid ==

=== Lucid ===

* One version
* Upgrade to a new version during in stable releases as well (eg. from 3.5 to 3.6, which is a security release)
* Worry about language pack updates: we would have to roll out updated language packs together with firefox updates; two solutions:
** Upload en-US.xpi, all translations prior to uploading actual package; use regular language pack updates, but prepare them just in time for when firefox is going to be built
** Manually export only firefox translations, integrate them into latest language pack export

* Template concerns: firefox-3.5 vs firefox-3.6 (switch probably in December)
** Export full translations and import them into new template
** Use unversioned templates
   
=== Translation updates for 3.6 ===

* Arne mentions that there is a bug - not possible to change source path in FF template

* Arne to upload all templates (Hardy, Intrepid, Jaunty, Karmic)
 
* We'd like to export and ship only Firefox translations on an update - QA'ing all translations (GNOME, KDE, etc) for all releases would be quite risky - difficult to get feedback from users for all releaes
* Manual export of FF translations only and put them on language packs - but full tarball export, extracting the Mozilla bits

* Not necessary for xulrunner - xulrunner to disappear - to be moved to Universe, all xulrunner translations to be moved to Firefox

==== QA ====

* List of languages that don't use the xpis
* List of languages with changes
* We should be extra careful with Hardy

=== agenda ===

* how to better utilize devmode
** export in upstream format
** export changes only
** export changes as upstream patch
** at export time inform users how to create xpi from the xpi.po file 
* feedback loop
* localized searchplugins - technical implementation, etc.

=== Actions ===

* David to communicate with the translations community to see if there is
   interest in scripting the steps to submit to upstream
* David to get feedback from the community about devmode and changes

== Additional Notes ==

<pre>

Background:
* most CVEs in the archive
* 

History:
* Mozilla has kept stable release branch upgraded (security and major fixes)
* typical: 40 CVEs, 120 fixes per microrelease
* promise of 6 months support for previous stable after a new release; after that we did backports ourselves
* Hardy: upstream support for 3.0 will end in December
* even though we follow the upstream review policy, we get much less QA
* once an LTS is released, it is hard to get testers for previous LTSes
* Chromium: no stable support at all, rolling upgrades for all users; Mozilla seems to like that
* Plan: Major version upgrades every 4 to 6 months, no support for previous stable at all any more

Pushing new major versions into stables:
* packaged and user-installed addons will just stop working
* Hardy QA wrt. other rdepends
 
 
we will need to get our extensions repackaged for each major release, every few weeks
 - extensions for the new version may take weeks to come out
 -> or remove the packages from the archive (except our own ones)
* do not want to use upstream binaries. lose gnome (VFS, Printing, ...) integration, LP integration, compiler hardening
 
Take as granted:
* back porting security fixes will no longer be sustainable
* we will not be able to change mozilla policy
 
What we would need to do:
* stop using system libraries, use bundled ones (which will double CVE tracking and exposures in these libraries, but work won't be significantly increased for these libraries -- the work will be shared potentially with firefox upstream)
* drop xulrunner to universe, resolve remaining rdepends
* 3rd party addons may go away from the archive for lucid; for stables: find an install.rdf hack which we ship in -updates which will cause firefox treat it as it was in the profile, and use the builtin auto-update feature
* moving away from Firefox as default browser is considered a bad user experience and not really feasible for lucid (rendering still not as good as ffox)

Problem with openjdk - firefox 3.6 is dropping the required API support for openjdk's browser plugin. If we release Firefox 3.6 for Karmic, we'll break everyone using openjdk as a browser plugin.

Alex' s3kr1t plan for Lucid and forward:
* drop xul runner, don't build against xul runner, ship what upstream is shipping
** important rdepends which we can't just remove: couchdb, eclipse, yelp
* ship without patches
* ship with bundled library
* no third parties releases
* open JDK? can we upgrade to it, or we will have to remove it and have Sun Java
* Do we plan to firefox
* Put sun java in partner archive

current stable releases:
* do the same for firefox, as long  as a version is supported, we force upgrades across stable releases
* find rdepends that are exposed to web content 
* ship the firefox with the non-system libraries
* epiphany: push to karmic version to use webkit backend

translations plan:
* import the new upstream XPIs manually into rosetta
* don't build new languages
* put them into langpack-o-matic
* either update -base package OR
* generally don't ship firefox translations in -base, just in updates (one-time transition for stable Ubuntus) 

Thunderbird:
* most CVEs are not an issue, since JavaScript is disabled
* does not need a similarly extreme thing, few remaining patches can be backported

How do we maintain this going forward
* should discuss with QA team how to support on major version upgrades early (while can still file bugs)
* 
 
 ACTIONS:
* start fixing the package to start building everything in firefox without patches
* same source  package for all stable releases
* figure out upgrade path for packaged extensions in stables
* create a security native PPA for the ff non-patched builds
* review xulrunner rdepends from hardy on which apps are potentially exposed to insecure contents
** switch to gtkhtml or webkit
** confine with apparmor
** ignore if they don't use javascript
* define who does what after the transition (ie security updates)
* rickspencer3 to schedule weekly call
