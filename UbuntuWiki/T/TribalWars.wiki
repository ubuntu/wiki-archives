From <nowiki>[[http://www.tribalwars.net|Tribal Wars.net]]</nowiki>: 

Tribal Wars is a free browser based MMOG. You can play the game from nearly any computer with internet access because there are no downloads necessary.

Your goal is to lead a medieval village to fame and power. With your help the small village will grow bigger and bigger. The population grows, production rises and trade prospers.

But not only your village grows. Neighbours are also looking to expand their influence. Troops are being recruited, villages are fortified and wild axemen plunder and kill.

You will meet other players, with whom you can fight together in a tribe.

Your village grows bigger and soon the formerly small village will conquer other villages...

== Recommended Beginner Strategy ==

# Read the <nowiki>[[http://wiki.tribalwars.net/?title=User_Submitted_Guides|beginners guides]]</nowiki> and consult the <nowiki>[[http://www.twplus.org/index.php?s=help_techtrees|tech tree]]</nowiki>.
# Raise your HQ to Level 3 to enable the Barracks.
# Build a level 1 Barracks.
# Build your wall to level 5. This will protect you from most nearby attacks as you grow. Get at least 50 spear fighters for extra defense.
# Using the map view, identify any nearby walled villages. A walled village is a sign that the owner is most likely not a beginner. If the village owner has a clan, copy that information down (url) and contact one of our Tribe's diplomats. The diplomat should attempt to arrange a non-aggression pact ("I won't hurt you if you won't hurt me.") with their clan.  If successful this will prevent some of the bigger clans from erasing you off the map.
# Build only based upon this goal: 
** Village Headquarters (Level 3) 
** Barracks (Level 1) 
** Rally point (Level 1) 
** Timber camp (Level 15) 
** Clay pit (Level 15) 
** Iron mine (Level 15) 
** Farm (Level 4) 
** Warehouse (Level 10) - Only raise this when you begin to approach full. You should be able to store as much as need for when you aren't playing.
** Wall (Level 5)
** Consider creating a paladin for village defense (create Statue and then activate).
# Reread the beginners guides for advanced play tactics.
# Enjoy!
