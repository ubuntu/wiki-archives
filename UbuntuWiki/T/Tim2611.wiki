__TOC__

I am new here, but I have some experience with different distributions. I startet with Suse Linux 5.x worked with red hat linux and changed to knoppix changed it again to a normal Debian. After this I stopped working with Linux and went to Apple OS X. I have heard of mythtv and setup a edubuntu server (based on feisty) because of the ltsp. I have upgraded feisty to gutsy. It is pretty cool to boot older pcs with edubuntu. No I have formated my notebook and installed gutsy. I am very imressed of ubuntu. I have no problems with it. I have acces to my wlan, I can use the eyetoy web cam and I have access to mythtv from every place;)
