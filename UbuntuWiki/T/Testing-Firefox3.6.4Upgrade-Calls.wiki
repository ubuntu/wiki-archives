=== Call For Testing Hardy ===

<pre>
Call For Testing: Hardy Firefox users

We need Hardy users to test our latest Firefox Upgrade!

* Background:*
Firefox 3.0 and xulrunner 1.9 are now unsupported by Mozilla. Rather than backporting security fixes to these now, we are moving to a support model where we will be introducing major new upstream versions in stable releases. The reason for this is the support periods from Mozilla are gradually becoming shorter, and it will be more and more difficult for us to maintain our current support model in the future (see [1] for information).

We are going to release Firefox 3.6.4 as a minor update to the 3.6 series in Lucid. This will also be rolled out to Hardy, Jaunty and Karmic (along with xulrunner 1.9.2.4). The update for Lucid is quite trivial, but the update in Hardy, Jaunty and Karmic is not quite as simple. As part of the upgrade, we are also releasing a set of langpacks. 

Before releasing these updates to the public, we need testing in Firefox, the extensions in the archive and distributions upgrades after those updates. We have published all these packages in a PPA [2] and we will track test results before moving anything to the archive. If you are using Firefox localised in your local language, please, make sure that the langpacks didn't break Firefox and that the translations are OK.

We need people running *Hardy* (Jaunty and Karmic will see a similar call for testing in the following days) in bare metal or a virtual machine. If you are willing to help, you can follow the instructions below:

1. Add the Mozilla Security PPA to your software sources

 You need to manually edit your /etc/apt/sources.list and add the following lines:

 deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntu-mozilla-security/ppa/ubuntu hardy main 
 deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntu-mozilla-security/ppa/ubuntu hardy main

 After saving the file, you have to run:

 sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 7EBC211F
 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

2. You have to have an account in our tracking system. Go to http://mozilla.qa.ubuntu.com and click on "Log In" and "Create New Account"

3. To know what to test and how to report back, please, read our instructions in our testing wiki:

   https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/Firefox3.6.4Upgrade

Thanks!

=== Call For Testing Karmic ===

<pre>
Call For Testing: Karmic Firefox users (or willing to install Karmic in a VM)

We need Karmic users to test our latest Firefox Upgrade!

* Background:*
As I told in a previous email[1], Firefox 3.0 and xulrunner 1.9 are now unsupported by Mozilla. We are going to release Firefox 3.6.4 as a minor update to the 3.6 series in Lucid. This will also be rolled out to Hardy, Jaunty and Karmic (along with xulrunner 1.9.2.4). The update for Lucid is quite trivial, but the update in Hardy, Jaunty and Karmic is not quite as simple. As part of the upgrade, we are also releasing a set of langpacks. 

Before releasing these updates to the public, we need testing in Firefox, the extensions in the archive and distributions upgrades after those updates. We have published all these packages in a PPA [2] and we will track test results before moving anything to the archive. If you are using Firefox localised in your local language, please, make sure that the langpacks didn't break Firefox and that the translations are OK.

We now need people running *Karmic* (Jaunty will see a similar call for testing in the following days) in bare metal or a virtual machine. If you are willing to help, you can follow the instructions below:

1. Add the Mozilla Security PPA to your software sources

 You need to manually edit your /etc/apt/sources.list and add the following lines:

 deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntu-mozilla-security/ppa/ubuntu karmic main 
 deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntu-mozilla-security/ppa/ubuntu karmic main

 After saving the file, you have to run:

 sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 7EBC211F
 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

2. You have to have an account in our tracking system. Go to http://mozilla.qa.ubuntu.com and click on "Log In" and "Create New Account"

3. To know what to test and how to report back, please, read our instructions in our testing wiki:

   https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/Firefox3.6.4Upgrade

Also, we have added a new testcase "XulRunner Applications" aiming to test that the applications using xulrunner keep working correctly after the update. These applications need to be tested both in Hardy and Karmic. A list of these applications can be found in the wiki:

    https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DesktopTeam/Specs/Lucid/FirefoxNewSupportModel/xulrunner-list

Thanks!
Ara.
