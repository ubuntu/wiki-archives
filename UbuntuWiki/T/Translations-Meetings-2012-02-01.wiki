=== Meeting summary ===

* '''Review of last meeting's actions''' (DavidPlanella)

** Andrej to follow up with the Wine developers on them using Launchpad for translators.
** Did that, no response from Wine developers.
** David to follow up with Scott Ritchie
** Gabor to review the NonLanguagePackTranslationDeadline page, add any missing packages and take care of the exports when the time comes
** Started working on it, but still WIP - exports do not need to be done until the non-langpack deadline
** David to send an e-mail to the docs team about how to best localize images
** TODO
** Kenneth to investigate the iCal structure from the language pack calendar feed and report on the next meeting if it's feasible/worth it to split the main feed and merge the resulting feeds into other calendars
*** Turned out not to be so difficult, so I was able to make a quick script for it. The code lives in: https://code.launchpad.net/~k-nielsen81/+junk/cal-split

* '''Upcoming deadlines in the release schedule''' (DavidPlanella)
** Language packs to be disabled for Alpha 2, to be released on the 2nd of February
