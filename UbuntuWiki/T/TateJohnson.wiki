__TOC__

I was previously a Gentoo user before migrating to Ubuntu simply because it works out of the box. On the outside, Ubuntu is a user-friendly distribution that still provides power users with the opportunity to get dirty. If they want to ;). I have a website, why not check it out? http://www.tatey.com
