=== TODO ===

* Improve the closing of the applications after the test. Right now it only closes the applications that have a "Quit" menu.
* Some applications differ the window opened depending on the state of the application (i.e. First time wizards v.s. main window). Right now this test only admits to look for one of them. Change it to admit a list of windows to look for.
