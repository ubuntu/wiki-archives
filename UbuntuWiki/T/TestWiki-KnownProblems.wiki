__TOC__

As part of the testing phase for an upgrade of the software that runs this wiki, we have temporarily placed a read-only snapshot at:

	https://testwiki.ubuntu.com/

This snapshot contains the data from this wiki as of around noon BST on Wed 16 April 2008.  Page edits have been disabled, and user logins will not function as they do here.

We ask that you test the site and report any problems below.

=== Problems Observed on Test Wiki ===

===== Ubuntu and Kubuntu themes not working =====

The CSS files and python modules for the themes require updating before they will function with the Moin 1.6 codebase.  As a result, the site currently uses the <code>rightsidebar</code> theme.

===== Category pages provide search interface instead of listing =====

The Category pages typically list all pages that link to them, allowing for the creation of quick indexes.  The testwiki instead appears to present a search dialog with no further data.  I suspect that this may be part of an attempt from upstream to reduce computation triggered by GET requests.

===== Side menu rendering =====

The side menu isn't rendering correctly. It appears the width tag as 50% in class: table-of-contents is to blame - making the table of contents too small.

===== Layout efficiency =====

As a layout, the "sidepanel" div takes a lot of usable space away from the page but is not persistent. If this was presented at the top of the page, then the real estate (in width) would be available throughout the document. If quick access is essential to those functions, could the CSS not be used to "float" the menu?

===== Sidebar drop down functionality =====

The sidebar drop down always returns to "Raw Text" and the "Go" button is unnecessary unless it stays as selected - for example repeated spell checks (nice feature BTW - not clear how it works at present though).

===== Overlap of revision history and sidebar with larger fonts =====

When the revision history page is viewed with a larger-than-default font and the rightsidebar theme, the revision history table overlaps with the right sidebar.
