== Touch Developer Preview - Porting Guide ==
<nowiki>[[File:tablet_pictogram.png||align="left"]]</nowiki> We want to port Ubuntu Touch to all kinds of devices. If you have experience in porting code to Android devices or are generally knowledgeable in terms of porting, working with the Kernel and other core bits and pieces of a distribution, this might be interesting to you.

Check out the list of <nowiki>[[..-Devices|devices]]</nowiki> to see what's currently being worked on.

=== Disclaimer ===

=== General ===
To rapidly support a wide range of devices, our architecture reuses some of the drivers and hardware enablement available for Android.

As a consequence, at the current images you'll find some of the Android services running at the device, and the Ubuntu filesystem living separately, inside a container.

For quick reference, these are the current components used from Android:
* Linux Kernel (stock Android kernel provided by the vendor, with a few changes to support some extra features needed by Ubuntu)
* OpenGL ES2.0 HAL and drivers
* Audio/Media HAL and services, to re-use the hardware video decoders
* RILD for modem support

As Ubuntu is running in a separated container on top of an Android kernel and services, the communication between them happens via Binder, Sockets and libhybris.

Other than the very basic services (needed to re-use the binary blobs already available), the rest is just pure Ubuntu goodness :-)

=== Building the Ubuntu packages ===
We expect the Ubuntu Touch packages won't need changes for new devices; the usual processes for contributing to Ubuntu apply, such as the SponsorshipProcess.

Either way, you'll need the Ubuntu preinstalled image besides the one you're going to build with the instructions below. You can find the Ubuntu preinstalled images <nowiki>[[http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-touch-preview|here]]</nowiki>.

=== Building the Android pieces ===
You can find all the needed Android git repositories at http://phablet.ubuntu.com/gitweb. This is basically a mirror of Cyanogen``Mod 10.1, but containing only the needed low level services used by Android (e.g. no Dalvik at all).

For any Android related project at our git server, you'll find a branch named phablet-10.1. This branch contains a static known git HEAD and the required changes needed for Ubuntu, including <nowiki>[[http://phablet.ubuntu.com/gitweb?p=CyanogenMod/android.git;a=blob;f=default.xml;hb=refs/heads/phablet-10.1|our custom Android manifest]]</nowiki>.

==== Set up your development environment ====
To support a wide range of devices, we decided to use Cyanogen``Mod as a base for the Android system. You could safely use AOSP, as we don't use a lot of the customizations and improvements done at the App/Java side, but it's easier with Cyanogen``Mod due the scripts and build procedures available for it.

Everything we take from Android is just C/C++, so you'll notice that your Android build environment will be way smaller than when comparing to the traditional Android builds.

For development you can run any 64-bit Desktop version of Ubuntu between 12.04 LTS and 13.04.

It's not strictly necessary, but it's helpful to install ccache.
(http://source.android.com/source/initializing.html#ccache in the general Android Setup guide should help with this.)

Additional packages which are used to build the host tools: <pre>
$ sudo apt-get install git gnupg flex bison gperf build-essential \
  zip bzr curl libc6-dev libncurses5-dev:i386 x11proto-core-dev \
  libx11-dev:i386 libreadline6-dev:i386 libgl1-mesa-glx:i386 \
  libgl1-mesa-dev g++-multilib mingw32 tofrodos \
  python-markdown libxml2-utils xsltproc zlib1g-dev:i386 schedtool</pre>

Additionally, to build the Android pieces, you will need a Java 6 JDK installed: <pre>
$ sudo apt-get install openjdk-6-jdk
</pre>
Using the OpenJDK will generate a warning, but the build still will proceed. Attempting to use OpenJDK version 7 will cause the build to fail.

You'll also need to <nowiki>[[..-Install#Step_1_-_Desktop_Setup|set up the tools PPA]]</nowiki>. This will also install the <code>repo</code> tool, used to sync the Android repositories. <nowiki>[[http://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html|Learn more about the repo tool]]</nowiki>.

All the Android code can be downloaded from the `phablet-dev-bootstrap` tool provided by the `phablet-tools` package installed in the previous step:

To get the code setup run:
<pre>
phablet-dev-bootstrap [target_directory]
</pre>

If for some reason the sync ends midway, you can continue the sync with the `-c` switch, so the command would be:
<pre>
phablet-dev-bootstrap -c [target_directory]</pre>

Alternatively, if you are just building an image for an already supported device, you can specify the `-v` switch:
 <pre>
phablet-dev-bootstrap -v [device codenames] [target_directory]
</pre>

The `phablet-dev-bootstrap` command will automatically use the `repo` tool with the Ubuntu Touch Preview custom manifest to download all the git repositories and needed data. '''Be aware that this step takes a long time and requires at least 15GB (plus 2-3GB for the binary output)'''.

==== Enabling a new device ====

As we're using !CyanogenMod, we can easily take advantage of all the devices that are officially supported there.

You can find codenames and devices by looking at http://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/w/Devices

===== Automatic =====

If your device is already supported by !CyanogenMod, you can use the same repositories available at github, and get them automatically by calling ''breakfast'' after sourcing the build environment, like:

<pre>
source build/envsetup.sh && breakfast codename
</pre>

Then breakfast will automatically set up your device specific repos at the local manifest file ''.repo/local_manifest.xml''.

Then to download all extra repositories, run the following command from the root directory:

<pre>
repo sync
</pre>

===== Manual (deprecated) =====

'''Note:''' This method is now deprecated as breakfast should work as expected. In case you still want to manually setup your environment, just follow the bellow instructions and make sure you have the <nowiki>[[http://phablet.ubuntu.com/gitweb?p=CyanogenMod/android_build.git;a=commit;h=9a969c980b93d90c15089a52d9bddd4d35c3a551|patch]]</nowiki> applied at your local tree. In case you want breakfast to use different trees, make sure you get in contact with the developers to allow making your specific tree available at phablet.ubuntu.com (which will then be used by breakfast).

From the individual device wiki page, grab the git repositories that are specific to your device, and update your local `manifest.xml` file (inside the <root>/.repo folder) including them, such as:

Kernel
Device specific

As a result you should have something like:
<pre>
kernel/[manufacturer]/[codename]
device/[manufacturer]/[codename]</pre>

Where:
`[manufacturer]` is the manufacturer for codename
`[codename]` is the product's codename.

It is possible that this structure is not followed as is the case for the Galaxy Nexus line from Samsung, where the codename is their base for the Galaxy's tuna.

Also, depending on the device, other dependencies might be required in addition to device and kernel specific directories. Be sure to check the file cm.dependencies  available on your CM device specific repository (e.g. https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android_device_samsung_p3110/blob/cm-10.1/cm.dependencies), and include them all in your local manifest. As we’re using Cyanogen``Mod branches on github, we should specify for each entry  remote="github" and  revision="refs/heads/cm-10.1".

In the end you should have something similar to the following (for Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 - Wifi):
 <pre>
$ cd .repo/manifests
$ git diff</pre>

 <pre> diff
diff --git a/default.xml b/default.xml

'''Remember''' that the above is just an example, it might not even reflect the same repos that are available at the gihub project, as that is updated quite frequently.

Then to download all extra repositories, run the following command from the root directory:

<pre>
repo sync
</pre>

==== Retrieving the proprietary blobs from Android ====

Ubuntu Touch Preview uses some pre-compiled binary drivers from the Android layer for rapid enablement of devices. These are referred to as binary or proprietary blobs, as their source code is not available for the build, and are included in binary form.

As we're using Cyanogen``Mod 10.1 as the base for our Android part, the easier way to retrieve working binary blobs (drivers, etc) is by flashing a working CM 10.1 based image. Here is an example of the list of <nowiki>[[https://raw.github.com/CyanogenMod/android_device_samsung_galaxysmtd/cm-10.1/proprietary-files.txt|binary blob files included in the image for the `galaxysmtd` device]]</nowiki>.

{*} '''Tip''': you can alternatively extract these binaries from the image (which is essentially a `.zip` file containing, amongst others, these binary files), but flashing it first helps as you can see if CM is working properly in the device.

To download Cyanogen``Mod 10.1 go to http://get.cm/.

Once you have your Cyanogen``Mod 10.1 based rom running at your device, run the following command to extract all the needed data:
<pre>
$ cd device/[manufacturer]/[codename]
$ ./extract-files.sh</pre>

This command should copy the needed files to `vendor/[manufacturer]/[codename]`.

==== Device changes ====

===== suid =====

The default <code>fstab</code> for the new device will have its <code>/data</code> partition mounted with <code>nosuid</code>, which needs to be removed, as certain Ubuntu applications/daemons require the use of ''setuid''. The path to <code>fstab</code> is:
 <pre>
device/[manufacturer]/[codename]/fstab.[codename]
</pre>

If you don’t find any files there, grep for “nosuid”.

Example:
 <pre> diff

==== Kernel ====
As a requirement from the Ubuntu userspace, we need to add a few extra kernel configs that are usually not enabled by default for Android.

===== Config =====

You can find your kernel config at <code>kernel/[manufacturer]/[codename]/arch/arm/configs/ cyanogenmod_[codename]_defconfig</code>. Please double check that it is indeed the default config file name in <code>device/[manufacturer]/[codename]/*.mk</code> (look for the TARGET_KERNEL_CONFIG variable).

Extra configs that need to be added
<pre>
CONFIG_SYSVIPC=y
CONFIG_NAMESPACES=y
CONFIG_UTS_NS=y
CONFIG_IPC_NS=y
CONFIG_USER_NS=y
CONFIG_PID_NS=y
CONFIG_NET_NS=y
CONFIG_DEVTMPFS=y
CONFIG_DEVPTS_MULTIPLE_INSTANCES=y
CONFIG_FSNOTIFY=y
CONFIG_DNOTIFY=y
CONFIG_INOTIFY_USER=y
CONFIG_FANOTIFY=y
CONFIG_FANOTIFY_ACCESS_PERMISSIONS=y
CONFIG_SWAP=y
</pre>

Reasons:
* `*_NS` to enable support for containers
* `SWAP` because we're still using a swap file by default
* Without `paranoid_network` disabled, the browser won't work correctly

===== Patches =====

When porting to a new device, you should include the following procfs patch which allows us to better manage applications running in the Ubuntu container.  As there is much variation in the kernels shipped with Android, the patch may need adjustment to apply cleanly.

Here's what the patch looks like for Maguro ( Galaxy Nexus ):

==== Build changes ====
===== main.mk =====

The main build file needs to be checked if updates are required to it to support new drivers or parts of the build not used before, it's path is: <code>build/core/main.mk</code>

The part of interest are the <code>subdirs</code> included in the build and if special treatment for devices need to be made, i.e.; make sure the new vendor, device or external subdirs are added.

===== Brightness indicator =====
Due to the incorrect default permission at the sys brightness file, a change is needed to allow any user to change the display brightness. We need to `chmod` it to the proper permissions.

You can usually find the permission settings needed at the device init file, which is usually available under `device/[manufacturer]/[codename]/init.[codename].rc`.

The changes should look like the following:

=== The image ===

==== Building the image ====

Example for the mako target.
<pre>
. build/envsetup.sh
brunch mako
</pre>

to build for your device's codename, run
<pre>
. build/envsetup.sh
brunch [codename]
</pre>

Sourcing the envsetup.sh file adds brunch and other functions useful when working with the Android source tree and building from scratch. See http://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/w/Envsetup_help

Calling brunch with no arguments will present a list of valid target names and you can pick one. That list prefixes each target with cm_ that is unnecessary when specifying it on the command line.

At the end of the build process a zip file will be generated in `out/target/product/<codename>`, that you can deploy to the phone through recovery.

<pre>
adb push out/target/product/<codename>/*.zip /sdcard/autodeploy.zip
adb reboot recovery
</pre>

==== Debugging ====

If your image does not boot you can get a kernel log of a failed boot by rebooting it into recovery (without powering it off) and once in recovery examining /proc/last_kmsg

==== Working in the environment ====

===== Networking =====
The simplest solution given that you have a UI available is to use the networking indicator on the device.  The network indicator currently supports basic Wi-Fi connections only ( eg. No security, WEP, WPA Personal ).

An alternate means of configuring networking is via the '''phablet-network-setup''' tool which is part of the phablet-tools package.  This script can be used to copy an active Network Manager system settings file from an Ubuntu Desktop ( >= 12.04 LTS ) to the device.  It also has some extra options which cause the tool to install network-related packages such as iw and openssh-server.

===== Copying files to the phone =====

Prerequisites:

This is required if you are not working from the Android source tree, as `fastboot` and `adb` should be built as part of system build for the host part, they should be in your path and located here:

<pre>
out/host/linux-x86/bin/
</pre>

If not installing a personal build, make sure you have `ppa:phablet-team` added, if not
<pre>
add-apt-repository ppa:phablet-team/tools
</pre>

Then make sure to install `adb` and `fastboot`. You can do so by installing the following packages:
<pre>
apt-get install android-tools-adb android-tools-fastboot
</pre>

To get packages to your phone's chroot execute the following from your desktop:
<pre>
adb root
adb push [filename|directory name] /data/ubuntu
</pre>

Then to access these files on the phone follow the shell section below

===== Screen Pixel Ratio =====

We have 2 important variables that define the pixel ratio behaviour of the system and the applications, ie. how they visually scale. Look at `/usr/bin/ubuntu-session` for `GRID_UNIT_PX` and `QTWEBKIT_DPR`.

When adding the correct pixel ratio for a new port, first use the method below to calculate the desired `DPR`, and create a device specific config file which ubuntu-session can load at run time.

The number of pixels per grid unit (`GRID_UNIT_PX`) is specific to each device. Its goal is to make the user interface of the system and the applications of the '''same perceived size''' regardless of the device they are displayed on.
It is primarily dependent on the pixel density of the device’s screen and the distance to the screen the user is at. That second value cannot be automatically detected and is based on heuristics. We assume that tablets and laptops are the same distance and that they are held at 1.235 times the distance phones tend to be held at.

A reference device has been chosen from which we derive the pixels per grid unit for all other devices. The reference device is a laptop with a 120 ppi screen and the pixels per grid unit is set to 8 px/gu.

There is no way for the system to dynamically identify the correct pixel ratio for the device, which as a side effect things might be bigger/smaller than expected. For each device you will have to visually verify the quality of the result and adjust the number if necessary. If unsure, send screenshots and screen specifications of the device to the Canonical design team.

To create your device specific configuration, first identify the '''ro.product.device''' android property used by your device (check the ''/system/build.prop'' file from your port or from the original Android image). Then with the desired DPR, create a file at ''/etc/ubuntu-session.d'' adding your custom GRID_UNIT_PX and QTWEBKIT_DPR variables, also specifying the default form factor you want, such as:
<pre>
$ cat /etc/ubuntu-session.d/manta.conf
GRID_UNIT_PX=20
QTWEBKIT_DPR=2.5
FORM_FACTOR="tablet"
</pre>

===== Shell =====
To obtain a `chroot shell` run these command from your desktop <pre>
adb root
adb shell
ubuntu_chroot shell</pre>

If you see a prompt that looks like this you are successfully connected to the phone's chroot shell.<pre>
root@localhost:/#</pre>

Files that were copied into `/data/ubuntu` above will show up in this root level directory. Packages can be installed using `dpkg -i`, or `apt-get install`.

====== SSH ======
Although this shell can be used to access the Ubuntu file system in the chroot, for any serious debugging it’s advised that you install openssh-server and use an ssh client to access the container.  This is due to the fact that the Ubuntu container uses its own PID namespace.

<nowiki>[[..-ReleaseNotes#SshAccess|Learn how to connect over SSH >]]</nowiki>

You can use adb port forwarding to easily connect to the container via SSH over USB.  To do so, run the following commands:
 <pre>
adb forward tcp:8888 tcp:22
ssh phablet@localhost -p 8888</pre>

====== phablet User Session ======
In order work with applications in the user session, it's necessary to run <code>su - phablet</code> after entering the chroot.

====== Shutdown of phone ======

Currently the power button does not work with recent kernels, so one of the following options must be run:
* remove the battery and replace it
* run "reboot -p" from the adb shell
 <pre>
adb root
adb shell reboot -p
</pre>

=== Ubuntu pieces ===
The Ubuntu container is put together using Ubuntu packages, which either come from the official Ubuntu archive or a personal package archive (PPA). The <nowiki>[[http://developer.ubuntu.com/packaging/|Ubuntu Development guide]]</nowiki> will tell you more about modifying source packages and submitting them to Ubuntu for inclusion.

If you follow the following articles you should have a better idea of how to fix bugs in Ubuntu and which tools to use:
* <nowiki>[[http://developer.ubuntu.com/packaging/html/introduction-to-ubuntu-development.html|Introduction to Ubuntu development]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[http://developer.ubuntu.com/packaging/html/getting-set-up.html|Getting Set Up]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[http://developer.ubuntu.com/packaging/html/fixing-a-bug.html|Fixing a bug in Ubuntu]]</nowiki>

Images are currently built in the Canonical data center and they are based on `quantal`. Over the next days all necessary changes for Ubuntu Touch are going to go into Ubuntu `raring` and images will be built using `raring` as a basis.

When setting up `pbuilder` in "Getting Set Up", you might want to use something like this: <pre>
pbuilder-dist quantal armhf create</pre>
to set up a builder on a foreign (non-armhf) architecture. To build a source package, you would then use something along the lines of: <pre>
pbuilder-dist quantal armhf build happyhello_0.1.dsc</pre>

This creates a native build chroot using `qemu-arm-static`; some programs may fail in this environment.  It is also possible to cross-build some packages, which is still somewhat experimental but can be used at least for many core packages; see CrossBuilding for details.

The article to <nowiki>[[http://developer.ubuntu.com/packaging/html/fixing-a-bug.html|fix a bug in Ubuntu]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[http://developer.ubuntu.com/packaging/html/fixing-a-bug-example.html|the tutorial]]</nowiki> also cover how to get a fix sponsored into Ubuntu.

=== Contributing back ===

Images can be published on `cdimages.ubuntu.com`, if they can be built reliably and automatically and all the bits and pieces are redistributable. The images are currently built from an internal Jenkins instance and are manually copied to cdimages.ubuntu.com. In the next few days, we'll be working on moving away from this internal instance and fully automate the build process.

If you have any questions about the images or would like to get images added, <nowiki>[[..-Contribute#Discuss|ask us on the mailing list]]</nowiki>.

==== patches ====

Anything you patch needs to be signed off and have a patch created for which needs to be submitted to ubuntu-phone@lists.launchpad.net

If it’s directly related to the supported devices it will be accepted after review. Patches are accepted for all components. If a device is enabled it does not mean it will be part of the nightlies.

Patches will be reviewed by Sergio Schvezov and Ricardo Salveti (rsalveti) until the gerrit instance is in place.

Let us know as well in case you'd like a git repository that is part of CM to be available at phablet.ubuntu.com. Currently we just added the minimal needed for the Nexus family, but that might change depending on the device used.

==== Merge requests ====
At any point time if you find a bug and have a fix don’t hesitate to create an MR against the specific branch.

The project list lives under the phablet umbrella, looking at the list there you can find your project and review the code and or provide fixes at your discretion
