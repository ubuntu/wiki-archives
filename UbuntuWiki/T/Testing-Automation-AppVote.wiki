This Poll is intended to come up with a list of applications that an automated script will run through regularly for development releases.
Hopefully this will ensure that desired applications will be bugfree when released by the Ubuntu team.
Please add your vote in the correct column (ONCE ONLY!) and add new rows (alphabetical order please!) for your favourite applications.

ScottTankard / ScottTankard2: I added spaces deliminating a string of five askterisks, for easy reading. If your vote crosses a multiple of five, please do this as well.
