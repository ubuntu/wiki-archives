=== Ubuntu-translations project feedback ===

* Do we want to use it for Answers 
** Should we specialize what ubuntu-translations answers is used for (eg. team set-up and different administrative sections)
* Used for bugs
** No reasons to file bugs against language-pack-*, package problems should be reported to langpack-o-matic and l10n problems possibly to Ubuntu Translations project
* Findability of Ubuntu Translators project for translators willing to file l10n bugs?
* Other uses:
** Code branches for translations-related scripts, code...
** announcements, RSS

=== Actions ===

* Bugs:
** Use API or simply search feature to search bugs against language-pack-* which are not also filed to Ubuntu Translations project. Get the numbers etc. 
*** This can actually be done by a normal search: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu (Timo)
*** http://tinyurl.com/langpackbugs
*** https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Translations/KnowledgeBase/HandlingBugs
** Add a brainstorming section on how to handle triaging, assignment, prioritisation and use of tags for the ubuntu-translations project (David)
