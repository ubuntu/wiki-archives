== Email Client ==

This web page is where we are coordinating the work to build a '''Trojita Email Client''' front-end for the Ubuntu Phone that could also extend to other form factors too with the responsive design features built into the <nowiki>[[http://developer.ubuntu.com/apps/sdk/|Ubuntu SDK]]</nowiki>

=== Contributing ===

The aim of this project is to add a new frontend to Trojita using the Ubuntu UI Toolkit.  Because it is contributing to upstream, rather than being a stand-alone project, the process for developing and contributing is different from the other Core Apps projects.

==== Get the Code ====

Upstream Trojita uses Git rather than Bazaar, so you will need to have the ''git'' package installed. To get a fresh clone of the upstream repository, run:

<pre>
git clone git://anongit.kde.org/trojita.git
</pre>

You can build Trojita for Ubuntu either from the commandline of inside !QtCreator.

==== Building in Ubuntu 13.10 or earlier ====

Trojita requires Qt 5.2, but versions of Ubuntu earlier than 14.04 currently have only 5.0.2 available.  You can still compile the Ubuntu UI port using 5.0.2, it will just fail a couple of tests around the Composer class.  To compile the code on Ubuntu 13.10 or earlier, you'll need to make the following change to your CMakeLists.txt:
<pre>
diff --git a/CMakeLists.txt b/CMakeLists.txt
index 5bd707c..9c0eb5d 100644
--- a/CMakeLists.txt
+++ b/CMakeLists.txt
@@ -56,7 +56,7 @@ endif()
 
 if(WITH_QT5)
     message(STATUS "Building the Qt5 version")
-    find_package(Qt5Core 5.2 REQUIRED)
+    find_package(Qt5Core 5.0 REQUIRED)
     find_package(Qt5Gui REQUIRED)
     find_package(Qt5Network REQUIRED)
     find_package(Qt5Sql REQUIRED)
</pre>

==== Building from the Commandline ====

In order to build the source from the command line, run the following:
<pre>
mkdir ./build
cd build
cmake -DWITH_UBUNTU=on ..
make
./trojita
</pre>

==== Building in QtCreator ====

To build inside QtCreator, select '''File->Open File or Project...''' and select the '''CMakeLists.txt''' file to open the project.  When prompted for CMake flags, use '''-DWITH_UBUNTU=on''', then run cmake.  After than, !QtCreator will build (and rebuild) the code when you tell it to run Trojita.

==== Finding things to work on ====

Instead of using Launchpad, this project uses upstream's bug tracker.  You can browse <nowiki>[[https://bugs.kde.org/describecomponents.cgi?product=trojita|all bugs]]</nowiki>, or just <nowiki>[[https://bugs.kde.org/buglist.cgi?product=trojita&component=Ubuntu&resolution=---|bugs specific to Ubuntu]]</nowiki> there.

In addition, we're tracking work items on <nowiki>[[https://trello.com/b/73rFyG6n/ubuntu-email-client|Trello]]</nowiki>

==== Submitting your changes upstream ====

Trojita uses KDE's <nowiki>[[https://git.reviewboard.kde.org/|ReviewBoard]]</nowiki> software for tracking and reviewing changes.  You will need a <nowiki>[[https://identity.kde.org/index.php?r=registration|KDE Identiy]]</nowiki> to use this service.

When you submit a change for review, be sure to set the review group to '''trojita'''

Instructions for getting your git repo setup for using Review Board are <nowiki>[[http://techbase.kde.org/Development/Review_Board#Using_post-review_to_post_changes_for_review|here]]</nowiki>.
