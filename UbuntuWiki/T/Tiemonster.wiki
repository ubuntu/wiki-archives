=== Contributions ===

I created a modified <nowiki>[[http://supybot.com/|Supybot]]</nowiki> to lurk in the #ubuntu-us-fl channel on freenode. I'm a contributer on the ubuntu-fl.org blog, am an active and regular contributer to the Florida Loco, and have attended a number of Loco functions.

=== Future Goals ===

I plan to port <nowiki>[[ScribesTeam-MootBot|MootBot]]</nowiki>'s functionality to <nowiki>[[http://supybot.com/|Supybot]]</nowiki> so that any loco that uses a bot based on <nowiki>[[http://supybot.com/|Supybot]]</nowiki> can have <nowiki>[[ScribesTeam-MootBot|MootBot]]</nowiki> functionality in their meetings. I also seek to find unique and creative ways to advocate for Ubuntu.
