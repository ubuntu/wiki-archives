Hi everyone.

My name is Tomas Gustavsson and I'm a Linux lover from the northern part of Europe, Sweden to be precise.

I have no extra-ordinary programming skills, I'm just a regular (or irregular, it depends on how you wanna see it) guy who really likes Ubuntu and the freedom that comes with it.

I'm happy to say that Communism works perfectly in the Ubuntu community and thankfully it doesn't work in the real world ;).
