__TOC__

This page will be the primary sign up sheet for contributors who wish to help with upgrading the Ubuntu Desktop Course from 7.10 to 8.04 LTS.  We are asking for volunteers to read through each chapter of the materials and if you have any suggestions, then add it to this list.  If you would also like to create a patch to address the change, add your name to that column so we know who is working them.  If you need to know how to create a patch, there will be a weekly session in #ubuntu-training on Wednesday @20:00 UTC.  Several wonderful folks have also updated the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Training/KnowledgeBase|KnowledgeBase]]</nowiki> with new instructions.

FYI: I am using the printed Instructor's Guide as my reference copy.

We also just received clarification that we will need to update all 'generic' type screenshots from the 7.10 desktop to the 8.04 HH default wallpaper.  (argh!!!!)  so we are also looking for 1 or 2 more dedicated screenshot contributors to help Popey with that process.  I'll create another page with out screenshot process.

=== Front Matter ===
Notes from EJ:
* The numbered sections are part of an auto-generated TOC. They should be fixed automatically on the next build. Please verify after building the next set of PDFs that the numbering is correct.

=== Chapter 3 Using the Internet ===
Notes from EJ:
* In the instructor notes it says that Liferea is NOT installed by default. Wasn't the rule that if it wasn't installed it wouldn't be included?
* There are also additional references to WengoPhone in this chapter. I thought that was going to be removed?
* There were no references to Ubuntu 7.10 in this chapter (so nothing changed to 8.04 LTS).
