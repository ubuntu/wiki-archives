== Introduction ==

Welcome to the Ubuntu Mobile Edition testing wiki. The pages linked within are designed to guide you through the process of setting up an environment, testing the features, and reporting bugs. As always, feel free to update these pages with any clarifications/additional information that you find useful along the way. Happy Hunting.

== Getting Started ==

=== Environment ===
The first part of preparation, is to get a working environment up and running. There are a couple different ways. To learn more about getting your environment up and running visit:<<BR>>
<nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/Cases/UbuntuMobileinstall| Environment Setup]]</nowiki>

=== Test Cases ===

This is a comprehensive test case suite designed to confirm compliance with all project requirements. Most of these tests can be performed on mobile hardware or in KVM on a development machine.

The cases have been split into three categories; Basic Feature, Advanced Feature, and Compliance Testing. 

==== Basic Feature Testing ====

The Basic Feature set are designed to cover the main applications included with Ubuntu Mobile Edition. They should be run as often as possible to ensure all baseline functionality is working.<<BR>>
<nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/Cases/UbuntuMobile-basic| Basic Functionality Testing]]</nowiki>

==== Advanced Feature Testing ====
Advanced feature testing covers functionality that is hidden or not used as often as the basic feature set. These cases often require advanced knowledge of the underlying system or access to system resources that are not commonly used.<<BR>>
<nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/Cases/UbuntuMobile-advanced-features| Advanced Feature Testing]]</nowiki>

==== Compliance Testing ====
Compliance testing ensures that Ubuntu Mobile Edition conforms to all project requirements. These include basic system versioning to the inclusion of licensing information in the delivered builds. Compliance is important to the success of Ubuntu Mobile Edition and is a vital requirement for many of companies implementing it.<<BR>>
<nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/Cases/UbuntuMobile-compliance| Compliance Testing]]</nowiki>

=== Reporting Bugs ===

All bugs discovered in Ubuntu Mobile Edition should be logged against the main project:<<BR>>
<nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-mobile| Ubuntu Mobile Edition]]</nowiki>

There is some information that, when included, can make the triage team and developers work much easier. Please paste the following template into your bug reports submitted against UNR, and try to provide as much of the information as you can.
