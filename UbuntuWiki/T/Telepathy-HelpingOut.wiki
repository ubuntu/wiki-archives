__TOC__

=== Packaging stored in bzr ===

To add your own package to the Team's repository, do:
* have a Launchpad ID
* add your SSH keys to it
* become part of the team
* <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/products/+new|create a new product]]</nowiki>
* create a bzr branch locally
* `bzr push --create-prefix sftp://<launchpad-id>@bazaar.launchpad.net/~telepathy/<product>/ubuntu`

If you want to have a separate branch of one of the packages, that's fine too:
* have a Launchpad ID
* add your SSH keys to it
* create a new product, if the product doesn't exist yet
* create a bzr branch locally
* `bzr push --create-prefix sftp://<launchpad-id>@bazaar.launchpad.net/~<launchpad-id>/<product>/ubuntu`

To checkout a current branch of a package, run:
* `bzr checkout <branch>` (where you get the branch URLs from the links above - they're usually of a form like: `http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~telepathy/cohoba/ubuntu`)
