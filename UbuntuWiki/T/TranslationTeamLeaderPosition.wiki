== Ubuntu Translation Team Leader ==

=== Defining the role ===

The Ubuntu Translation Team Leader is the person in charge
of being the contact between the developer and translator worlds
of Ubuntu.

The key missions are:

1. Quality Assurance for Rosetta

    QA is one of the areas where Rosetta is getting some heat from
    translators and some Ubuntu users. Rosetta offers an easy way to
    contribute translations to Ubuntu, but there needs to be some
    mechanism which leverages a low entry barreer and acceptable
    translations for the distribution.

    - We must define a set of requirements to become an Ubuntu translator.
    - We should write a manual with hints and good practices for our
      translators.
    - We could transfer ownership of the ubuntu-l10n-xx teams to the UTTC,
      who could this way be a referee for unresponsive admin/team conflicts
      requests in the Ubuntu Translators group.
    - We need a procedure to find the health of a team at any given time
      (dormant leaders, abandoned teams...) and take action as necessary.
    - We need to write clear policies about the duties for the team admins
      and members.

2. Rosetta developers/Rosetta users coordination

     - Find out what users want from Rosetta and prioritise feature
       requests/bugfixes.

3. Rosetta/Upstream coordination

    - Should be the Rosetta contact with upstream for Ubuntu related
      discussion. This includes helping them get their Rosetta issues
      solved (prioritising bugs, pushing us, etc. that affect upstream).
