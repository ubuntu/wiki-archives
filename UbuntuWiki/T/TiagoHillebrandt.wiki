I'm a Brazilian web developer, that uses free software since 2004. My first contact with Ubuntu was on version 6.06, Dapper Drake, through CDs that was sent to me from a Ship It request. Currently, I'm a student of Information Systems at Santa Catarina State University.<<BR>>
I contribute to various projects by translating them through Launchpad; in 2009 I was approved as a reviewer in Ubuntu Brazilian Portuguese Translators LoCo Team. Also suggested some ideas in Ubuntu Brainstorm and reported some bugs at Launchpad Bug Tracker.<<BR>>
Since February 2011, I'm member of Ubuntu Brazilian Planet, available in http://planeta.ubuntu-br.org. In April 2011, I was indicated as Administrator on Ubuntu-SC LoCo Team.<<BR>><<BR>>
