== Introdution ==
Better explaination of Ubuntu OS and how it relates to us.

Ubuntu OS currently run on top of an Android "shell". The android layer contains the boot.img(kernel/ramdisk), initd, vendor specific drivers etc.. This is what first boots then the ubuntu file system is loaded within this Android "shell". This is why we need flash two zips to have it working(Android and Ubuntu). Ubuntu uses CM10.1 repos for the Android shell portion of the OS. This still works for us as we had official cm 10.1, though development wasn't long lived before moving to 10.2.
There is an AOSP 4.4.2 branch Ubuntu is working on to maybe replace the CM based Android component, but it is currently less stable than the CM based. Hopefully the AOSP branch becomes more stable in the near future as the development for our device is active there.
