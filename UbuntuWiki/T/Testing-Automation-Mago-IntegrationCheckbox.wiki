Progress on running LDTP tests with checkbox

==== Status ====

==== Next Steps ====

==== Problems ====

* checkbox requires to be run as root in order to run some hw specific test. Desktop tests are better when run as a normal user, as it mimics the real workflow of the user. Solutions:
** Separate test suites that require root privileges from those that don't
** su - ?

* Using checkbox (hwtest) with it, as part of the manual.txt suite, it makes LDTP crash (due to the Accessibility of root not being enabled) and the only way I found to reenable it is logging out and in again.

* /usr/share/hwtest is only writable by root. If we want hwtest to be run by normal users, we would need to have another place to run the tests. (~/.hwtest ??)
