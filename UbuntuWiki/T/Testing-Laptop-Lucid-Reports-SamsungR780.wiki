==== Notes ====
* '''snr-002:''' dbus test failed, other tests worked, but wouldn’t automatically return form suspend. Last test failed: computer went to suspend, but wouldn’t return automatically; on manual power up computer locked up with backlight turned on with black screen, and Caps``Lock indicator turning on and off indefinitely. Upon forced shut down and subsequent power up, wireless was turned off, and CPU-stepping was switched from “on demand” to “performance”. No automatic error reports were sent.
* '''him-001:''' Only tested MicroSD with SD adapter.
* '''khk-001:''' Tested with attached USB keyboard. Keys work, and register, but have issues. When playback is started, and then stopped or paused, upon pressing “Play” again, it shows in Totem GUI that playback resumed, but the file is not being played nor buffered, untill you restart it manually with double-click.
