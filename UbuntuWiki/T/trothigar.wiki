== About Me ==

Hi my name is Fabian. I've been an Ubuntu user since Breezy but have only recently become interested in getting involved with the Ubuntu community.

=== My Involvement with the Ubuntu Community ===

==== IRC ====
You will likely find me on the following irc channels on freenode pretty much 24/7. I'm very bad at signalling that I'm away. You've been warned :P.

* #ubuntu
* #ubuntu-desktop
* #ubuntu-youth

==== Launchpad ====
I've fixed a few bugs and triaged a few more and hope to do more of that in the future.
Packaging is something that I want to get involved with over the course of 11.04.

=== Current Technical Skills ===
* Python
* Networking (TCP/IP)
* Basic familiarity with the underpinnings of Linux

=== Current Projects & Goals ===
* Helping out on IRC
* Helping in the ubuntu-youth project
* Learning how to program in C
* Helping out with the bug-squad

=== Future Projects & Goals ===
* Learning the in and outs of packaging
* Learning how to program in LISP
* Getting involved with desktop development

=== Testimonials ===
''Please Note: If you would like to describe any of my contributions to the Ubuntu Community, please feel free to do so. Thank You.''
