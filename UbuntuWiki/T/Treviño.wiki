=== About Me ===

My name is '''Marco Trevisan''' and I'm an ''Italian'' student in Computer Science at the <nowiki>[[http://www.unifi.it|Università di Firenze]]</nowiki> and an Ubuntu user since 2005 and an <nowiki>[[Membership|Ubuntu member]]</nowiki> since August 2011. I've tried to contribute to this awesome project since the first time I started using it, promoting it at the beginning as a blogger and then contributing with packages and code.

==== Small Technical Bio ====

I'm a 25 years old Italian student in computer science, I'm involved in open source for about 7 years (not considering the time I was patching eMule): after my first kubuntu installation, I decided to get involved as a blogger (<nowiki>[[http://blog.3v1n0.net|blog.3v1n0.net]]</nowiki>, now unmaintained) in the Italian oss-blogsphere becoming in few months one of the most popular bloggers writing about linux in Italy, then I decided to go more in deep putting my efforts in packaging as a "freelance", since I opened a repository (known as ''3v1n0 repository'' in the ubuntu community) with some common bleeding-edge software packages and tools not yet available in the official repositories and the repo got fastly thousands of users.

After some months I joined the '''compiz''' (quinn) community, at the beginning I just posted few patches for configurators, then I worked a little more on plugins with some fixes.
When the compiz-fusion project was started I joined the development team and I started working in packaging it for ubuntu (for my unofficial bleeding edge "eyecandy" repo, again), creating some tools for making .deb's and wrappers for running it (including the compiz.wrapper script provided in some past ubuntu releases) and making some patches for CCSM and libcompizconfig.
Then, since autumn of 2007, due to personal and study issues, I had to stop my work there (my bad! Considering the role that compiz has and will have in Ubuntu! :P) and I just did my first great move to Ubuntu (I was using kubuntu and so KDE before), since I needed something that "just worked very well" :P.

Since the beginning of 2008 I started following the '''Openmoko''' project, joining its community until the release of their first phone, the ''Neo Freerunner''. With an Italian sales-group that I managed, I bought one of the first devices sold and I started hacking with it and working on its tookits, providing patches for qtopia-x11, Android, illume (enlightenment module for mobile devices); I also started to develop some applications for it, mostly written in C and using the Elementary EFL toolkit (like elmIM, an instant messager and eTube, a youtube browser), this pushed me to improve the toolkit itself, starting to provide patches to elementary, illume and ecore making me to gain the privilege of becoming an '''EFL developer'''. In recent times I joined the SHR project (which aims to create a stable release for open mobile devices using the freedesktop.org backend) contributing to some UI libraries (elementary, dbus and glib based) and rewriting some FSO parts in Vala.

Recently I worked with some '''Vala''' programs, this lead me to work also in the language itself and so I've worked over its compiler code providing some patches upstream.

=== My Ubuntu Contributions ===

My first "official" Ubuntu contributions were just few bug reports, random fixes on the Wiki or some posts on UbuntuForums.
Then, with Unity coming I considered it as a great chance for improving Ubuntu, making it something of really different that can be freely developed without being too much dependent from other platforms/projects; I'm always interested in knowing new frameworks and to improve them (especially where they lack of something I'd need in my user-experience) so I firstly fixed some bugs in '''gwibber''', then I moved on the "desktop-side" and I started to work on many '''Unity''' related projects such as the '''Indicators''' (including libindicator, indicator-sound, indicator-datetime, indicator-messages, indicator-applications, libappindicator), '''BAMF''' (the windows matching framework) and unity itself, of course.

If at the beginning I mostly worked to scratch my itches and to improve the Ubuntu desktop accordingly to my user experience, then I joined the unity ''bitesize'' program working to fix bugs. Then, after attending the '''UDS-O''' in Budapest (thanks to the Canonical sponsorship) as an Ubuntu Community Contributor, I also worked to implement the features requested in the ''backlog'' bugs (which are directly defined by the Design team).

During the natty cycle I had the opportunity to lead the session "<nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ MeetingLogs/ appdevweek1104/ UnityHacking|Unity hacking]]</nowiki> story" at the <nowiki>[[UbuntuAppDeveloperWeek]]</nowiki> 11.04, and give some help on the <nowiki>[[http://askubuntu.com/users/7788/trevino|AskUbuntu]]</nowiki> platform.

Recently I also provided some '''translations in Italian''' through Launchpad.

Finally I worked in some ubuntu '''packages''' such as metacity, libwnck, libsdl1.2, pygame, gnome-settings-daemon to include in them some patches I made.

The detailed list of all my ubuntu contributions as an ''Unity Community Hacker'' are in my <nowiki>[[Treviño/UbuntuContributions|UbuntuContributions]]</nowiki> sub-page.

 - Marco has been a monster on Unity for the entire last cycle and the O cycle (which is about 50% complete). This cycle Marco has improved a bunch by being a lot more focused on fixing the backlog bugs and helping the team focus on certain areas (instead of just fixing a random looking pile of bugs) - I think this will have a measurable impact on the quality of Unity in Ubuntu for 11.10. Recommendations for future growth - don't take on more than you can chew, just go at your own pace and allow yourself to grow naturally. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:jorge]]</nowiki> 
 - Marco has been essential to Unity's development, initially starting out by helping tackle bugs that slipped between the Unity-team's fingers and then growing into a trusted developer that not only handles large development tasks (be it features or bug fixes), but also helps with code reviews for merge requests. Having met him personally, I can say that he'd be an excellent addition to the Ubuntu community! -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:njpatel]]</nowiki>
