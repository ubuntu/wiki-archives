Dear David,

We have translated 100% of the Course. But now we have 2 questions for the moment:

* What is the mechanism of translating illustrations from the Course? We have already made the most part of the screenshots, but not sure how to embed them into Launchpad.

* Would this be possible to make some short guide, how we can make a PDF using translated strings from LP? Because none from the team seems to have any experience with the process. 

We would be grateful if you help us to clear things up a little.

Thank you
