=== IRC Channel ===
The Ubuntu-tn community is currently utilizing the <nowiki>[[http://www.freenode.net|Freenode]]</nowiki> servers for IRC. If you are going to join a session, the channel to use is #ubuntu-tn-classroom. If it is your first time using IRC, we ask that you simply review the <nowiki>[[IrcGuidelines|IRC Guidelines]]</nowiki>. You may also be interested in this list of <nowiki>[[Classroom-IRCHOWTO| IRC HOWTO]]</nowiki> Pages.  To connect to the IRC server, use the following information: 
* '''Server:''' ''irc.ubuntu.com''
* '''Port:''' ''8001''
Once connected to the server type <code>/j #ubuntu-tn-classroom</code> to join the classroom channel. <code>#ubuntu-tn-classroom</code> isn't the main support channels, so you can't expect to join it searching for answers, as most of the time it is a ghost towns. We recommend you continue using <code>#ubuntu-tn</code>, <code>#ubuntu</code>, <code>#kubuntu</code>, <code>#edubuntu</code>,or <code>#xubuntu</code>.

=== Information ===

The classes will start promptly at the designated times. The classroom will be open briefly in order to provide the members and students the opportunity for brief introductions and instructions. Once the class begins, the channel may become moderated (+m), meaning only instructors and administrators will have speaking privileges. This will insure there are no interruptions, making the class enjoyable for everyone attending. If you have a question, there will be a moderator that will take your questions via a message. You can message the moderator by typing <code>/msg nickname question</code>. Further instructions will be given at the beginning of each class.

See the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Classroom/Guidelines|Ubuntu Classroom Guidelines]]</nowiki> for more details.
