__TOC__

Ultimately, an educational computing platform is only as good at the educational software tools that run on it.
This page is the place to document the educational software tools which we either have or hope to have on
Edubuntu.

=== AP Java ===

A meta package that installs all the software needed to teach introductory programming with
Java.  This will include:

** Java runtime
** Java software development kit (sdk)
** An easy to use development environment for Java
** AP classes and interfaces
** Marine Biology Case Study

The ApJava page documents what we are doing at Yorktown High School this year to teach AP CSC
using Java in an Edubuntu lab without the benefit of this meta package.
