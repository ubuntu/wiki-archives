Meeting 2014-05-12:
* Chair: Martin Pitt
* Attendees: Adam Conrad, Marc Deslauriers
* Apologies: Stéphane Graber, Steve Langasek, Kees Cook

* Action review:
** Steve to work with SRU team to get a list of how the provisional MREs have/haven't been used: '''DONE'''

* Mark's "Matters approaching"
** Not a good meeting IRC topic, reminder to follow up via email
** Will also be discussed at Malta sprint

* Review our current "provisional" Micro Release Exceptions
** The TB reviewed the current list based on Brian Murray's errors/LP bugs analysis
** '''ACTION:''': pitti to follow up with Maarten Lankhorst about the mesa MRE; it caused regressions (UbuntuBug:1134974) which haven't been triaged, and in general this package is almost impossible to regression test on the world's hardware. Is this still a requirement? If not, we would like to drop this MRE.
** '''ACTION:''' Adam to review the reported bugs from vlc updates (which are most probably not regressions)
** '''ACTION:''' Martin to review the reported bugs from LibO updates and check whether there are definite/likely regressions
** '''AGREED:''' All other provisional MREs have a good track record of actually being used and no reported regressions (caveat: apport doesn't auto-report on servers) and will be turned into full MREs.

* Meeting time: Still being discussed via email
