== About me ==

My name is Tushar Burman. I work for an business information services company, and track the IT sector. My primary weblog is at http://tushar.afraid.org and you can find me on various social/business networks and elsewhere online.

=== Linux/Open Source ===

I've been using Linux since 1995 and spent a few years doing admin-related backend work with Linux servers. I did a lot of Qmail-based email servers for a while, with some pretty crazy cross-country setups. I also use Ubuntu as my Laptop OS of choice. I also have some experience with Free/OpenBSD and have tinkered with email servers and firewalls on those platforms. I encourage people to try and use Linux on their personal and work computers, though I am realistic about exactly what kinds of people will be successful.

=== Personal ===

Other interests include DIY geekery, audio and motorcycles. I own and ride a 1984 Yamaha RD350 two-stroke motorcycle. Consequently, I never leave home without a reasonable toolkit, 2T oil and know how to ride several kilometers on flat tyres and fix broken clutch levers with pieces of dry grass.
