=== Profile ===

My name is Thierry Carrez, I'm a developer in Ubuntu's Server Team. I am interested in making Ubuntu Server a market-leader solution for servers in large companies, by supporting the common featureset required in those servers and providing better integration and usage experience than the alternatives.
