My name is Simon Quigley (tsimonq2) and I am from Wisconsin, USA. I am currently 13 years old(I turn 14 in March of 2016). I have been interested in computers for the past few years, and I started using Ubuntu in February 2015. My contributions started in late July after asking a question on a Lubuntu IRC channel and meeting friendly people. My forms of contribution include but are not limited to: Package and ISO QA, Ubuntu Weekly Newsletter summaries and link finding, complete reincarnation of the Ubuntu US Wisconsin Local Community Team, helping a lot with Lubuntu, being a Google Code-in mentor, Ask Ubuntu, and various manual QA test case fixes.

I hope you look favorably upon my application for Ubuntu Membership. If you have any questions/comments/concerns please let me know. Thank you.
