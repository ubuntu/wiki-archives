=== Current Issues ===
* Will not read or play VCD
* Problem that exists on both on-board and external keyboard.When i press the up, left or right arrow keys, a window pops up of a screenshot of the desktop, prompting me to save or cancel. The same thing happens when I hit Del Home PgUp PgDn, End. However, pressing the Windows Key and the corresponding above mentioned keys will work.
* If I forget to press the Windows key may system hangs with all the Take Screenshot popups that appear.
* I have tried setting System > Preferences > Keyboard > Layout Options > Misc Compatibility Options > Shift & Numpad keys work as in MS Windows, and it worked the first time I set it. However, after reboot the effect was gone, although the option is still selected.
* IrDA port does not work (although fully functional when it was running Winxp)
* SD Card reader driver not available
* Modem driver not available

==== Notes ====
* One of the bigger problems encountered was how to install the updated driver for Nvidia. This was solved by installing Envy (http://albertomilone.com/nvidia_scripts1.html) and letting it do the work.

* Encountered problems when setting up VPN connection to a Windows Server, could do so on a wired connection but not on wireless. Problem was solved by following directions found here (http://customisinglife.wordpress.com/2006/11/20/vpn-connection-in-edgy/), while noting entry about network-manager here (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/NetworkManager) under "Configuring Devices".
