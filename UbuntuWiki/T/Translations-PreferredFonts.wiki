== List of preferred fonts for the Live CD ==

=== Introduction ===

For our Ubuntu Live CD, we try to cover as many languages as possible, but unfortunately we are limited by the available space on the CD. Usually font packages include multiple fonts for a given language or set of languages, but we simply don't have enough space on the LiveCD to install all relevant font packages.

Therefore we will pick one or two fonts per language or script from the existing font packages and repackage them into a `ubuntu-desktop-fonts` package to ensure that the most popular languages can still be rendered on the screen. 

If the user installs Ubuntu on the hard disk and has Internet connection available, the relevant font packages for his/her language(s) will still get automatically installed as usual. In order to pick the most suitable fonts for our LiveCD desktop, we'd like to ask the community for suggestions and comments on the font selection for their language(s). Below is a table with current suggestions and a Remarks field.

* Please fill in a comment if the current pick is OK for your language or if you would suggest another font instead. If your language or script is missing, feel free to add it to the list.

| KACST One
| The current font in the repository is too old, it should be updated with the latest (improved) 3.0 release. The new version should ideally be packaged alone (not bundled with other KACST fonts).
