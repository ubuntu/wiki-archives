''' This page is a draft, and the procedure described here has not yet been approved. DO NOT follow these instruction until they have'''

This page describes how translation team coordinators can request a manual language pack update, outside of the scheduled language pack updates. '''We need to decide whether we actually want to limit who can make these requests to the coordinators --Kenneth Nielsen '''

== Requirements ==

A manual language pack update involves quite a lot of extra work for the developers involved. Therefore, the number of these requests should be kept to an absolute minimum. These manual updates are '''ONLY''' for the case where you have a very critical translation bug, and the next planned update is not for some time.

'''Expand on this section if we decide that language pack updates after the first 6 months of stable release should be performed as manual updates only. --Kenneth Nielsen '''

== Procedure ==

The request for a manual language pack update is made via a bug report. Please follow the instructions below to make sure that the bug is reported against the right package and contains the correct information.

=== Find the right package in Launchpad ===

The bug should be reported against the language-pack-LL package, where LL is the language code, so e.g. the Danish package is named language-pack-da. This package can be found on Launchpad on a URL similar to this one: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/maverick/+source/language-pack-da

Therefore, to find the right package use the URL above and replace "maverick" with the code name for the distribution you wish to perform a language pack update for, and replace "da" with your own language code.

'''I would have loved to simple give instructions on how to find the package, in stead of instructing them to edit a URL, but I could not find a search pattern that would consistently give me the right package -- Kenneth Nielsen '''

=== Make the request as a bug report ===

When you have found the right package, make a new bug report from this template:

`Request:`<<BR>>
`The LANGUAGE NAME team requests a manual update of the language package language-pack-LL`<<BR>>
`for DISTRIBUTION CODE NAME.`<<BR>>
`` <<BR>>
`Reason:`<<BR>>
`Describe here the reason for the manual language pack update request. This must`<<BR>>
`include the special circumstances for this update that warrant the special update.`<<BR>>

When you are done with the bugreport, then subscribe the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-langpack|ubuntu-langpack]]</nowiki> group to the bug.

'''--Kenneth Nielsen Should/can they assign the bug report to the ubuntu-langpack group right away? --Kenneth Nielsen '''

'''--Kenneth Nielsen Should we instruct them to set a certain priority right away? --Kenneth Nielsen '''

=== Testing ===
After making the request you will be contacted when the language pack has pushed to the <nowiki>[[Testing-EnableProposed|proposed repository]]</nowiki>. You will then have to test it according to the guidelines on <nowiki>[[Translations-LanguagePackUpdatesQA|this page]]</nowiki> (though you should of course not add it to the table there, which is only for regular language pack updates).

After testing give confirmation in the bug report that it has indeed been tested, and it will then be pushed as a regular update.
