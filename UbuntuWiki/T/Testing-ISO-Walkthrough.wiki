__TOC__


== Your first ISO test ==
This page will walk through submitting a result for an iso test. While this runs through using a single image test the information can be applied to any iso and any testcase.

== Prerequisites ==
'''Make sure you understand what the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/QATracker|QATracker]]</nowiki> is -- read that page first!'''

'''Read the <nowiki>[[QATeam-DevelopmentSetup|Development Setup]]</nowiki> page'''

== Logging in to the iso tracker ==
* Open a browser and navigate to <nowiki>[[http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[File:login.png]]</nowiki> Click the login link located on the lefthand side of the page
* Enter your ubuntu sso account information

== Selecting the milestone ==
Once logged into the package tracker, you should see a list of milestones. During development there is either a ‘daily’ iso, or a set milestone like alpha, or beta, etc. For this test, click the current daily or alpha/beta, etc, milestone for the current development release.

'''NOTE: Only milestones with a status of 'Testing' can have test results submitted. If the status is set to released, no new results can be contributed'''. 

== Finding the testcase ==
Note the list of products displayed that correspond to the milestone selected. Find the product for the corresponding image you wish to test. For example, the ubuntu desktop amd64 iso. Find the ‘Ubuntu Desktop amd64’ iso by searching the page, then click the link.

Next, a page listing the testcases for the selected iso (product) is shown.

<nowiki>[[File:testcases.png]]</nowiki>

<nowiki>[[File:links.png]]</nowiki> At the top are two links; one containing the download links for the iso, and the other giving information on how to report a bug found while testing the iso. Take a moment to review the bug reporting instructions page.

Feel free to run any testcase you wish. If this is your first image test, it's recommended to try the "Install (entire disk)" testcase. This is a simple testcase that teaches the basics of installing using ubiquity. For more information on the testcases, see <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/InstallMethods|this link]]</nowiki> and/or read through the testcase in question.

== Executing the testcase ==
Once you boot from the image, start reading the testcase. The testcases follow a simple <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/TestCaseFormat|format]]</nowiki> - perform an action, and then expect a result. A step in this <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/TestCaseFormat|format]]</nowiki> is shown below.

Go through each step of the testcase and follow the instructions. Perform the action, and ensure the expected result occurs. If something different occurs, note it as a bug, but continue the testcase.
