__TOC__


I'm the upstream author and Ubuntu contributor of the <nowiki>[<nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mumble/|Mumble]]</nowiki></nowiki>] package.

=== Goals ===

Improve the world of audio on Ubuntu (and Linux in general). Mumble tends to use bleeding edge libraries and technologies, so I spend quite a bit of time fixing bugs in related audio packages.

=== How to reach me ===

* Email: launchpad@natvig.com or slicer@users.sourceforge.net
* IRC: ''slicer'' on FreeNode and OFTC.
