This page provides instructions on how to retrieve debug logs from an Ubuntu device for debugging purposes
=== Before you start ===

==== Prerequisites ====
# A device running the Ubuntu development release (Utopic Unicorn)
# A host computer with ADB (Android Debug Bridge) installed. It's recommended to use Ubuntu 13.04 or later, but it can also be executed from other platforms (e.g. Windows or OS X)

==== Install ADB on Ubuntu ====
# On the Ubuntu host computer, open a terminal with Ctrl+Alt+T
# Type the following command, followed by Enter
<pre>
    sudo apt-get install android-tools-adb
</pre>

=== Extracting debug information ===

==== Update apps and the OS ====

Ubuntu uses the same interface via the System Setting app to handle 2 types of updates independently:
* OS updates
* App updates

The visual workflow below shows how to update either of them.

<nowiki>[[File:InstallUpdates.png||width=900]]</nowiki>

==== Run the application ====

# On the device, go to the Apps Scope
# Type the name of the app in the search bar
# Tap on the result icon to start the app

==== Retrieve logs from the device ====

# Connect the mobile device running Ubuntu to the host computer also running Ubuntu via USB
# On the Ubuntu host computer, open a terminal with Ctrl+Alt+T
# Type the following commands, each followed by Enter
<pre>
    mkdir logs
    cd logs
    adb pull /home/phablet/.cache/upstart/
    adb pull /var/crash
    cd ..
    tar -zcf logs.tar.gz logs
</pre>

The final step will result in a file called <code>logs.tar.gz</code>. Please send that file to those debugging those logs.

=== Known issues ===

==== Account settings won't start ====

Due to a change in the Online Accounts API it might be possible that some leftover files are in the device, preventing the Online Accounts settings page to load (see <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-system-settings-online-accounts/+bug/1328614|bug 1328614]]</nowiki>).

To remove the leftover files:

# On the Ubuntu host computer, open a terminal with Ctrl+Alt+T
# Type the following command, followed by Enter:
<pre>
    ls .local/share/accounts/applications
</pre>
1. Remove the duplicate entries that have a version number in their name.

E.g. If the two following files are shown, please delete the one with the 0.4.161 version appended to its name

<pre>
    com.ubuntu.reminders_reminders.application
    com.ubuntu.reminders_reminders_0.4.161.application
</pre>

<pre>
    rm .local/share/accounts/applications/com.ubuntu.reminders_reminders_0.4.161.application
</pre>
