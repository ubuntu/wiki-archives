Current process/policy: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TranslationLifecycle

== non-language pack stuff ==
* 

== Dev release ==

* delta updates twice per week

== Testing guidelines ==

* Check a list of packages
* Application  runs
* Are translations in order
* GNOME Desktop (core set of apps):
** home folder, nautilus, menu
** Firefox and help
** (OO.o) -- not in language-packs yet, those are in separate packages and currently come directly from upstream.
** Evolution
** F-Spot
** Pidgin/Empathy
* KDE Desktop (core set of apps):
** TBD
* Are newly done translations present/displayed
 
* GNOME point release translations after Ubuntu release are not imported into LP unless they solve a critical bug
** let tranlators know that they will have to manualy upload po files
 
* ubuntu-langpack or ubuntu-langpack-testing project
** Tracking feedback by bugs
** Translators add tasks for the tested langs, to avoid pre-creating 250 tasks in advance
** People can subscribe/assign/launchpadlib can create reports, etc.
 
=== Langpack inclusion ===

* translation teams with small percentage of translations

* Change Ubuntu Translators to 'Restricted'

* Assess activity of translation teams
** check that leaders are subscribed to ubuntu-translators
* ask localization coordinators to be part of ubuntu-translators

* together with Launchpad Translators group, also apply those actions to Ubuntu group
