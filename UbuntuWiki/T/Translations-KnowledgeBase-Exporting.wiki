== Introduction ==

This document explains how to export translations from Launchpad, either as single PO or MO file for offline translation, testing or sending back upstream, or as a tarball containing all translations of a given release.

== Exporting a single translation ==

You can download single PO files to translate offline and later upload them to Launchpad, or send them to an <nowiki>[[..-..-Upstream|upstream translation project]]</nowiki>.

To do this, after you've logged in to Launchpad you'll have to click on the '''Download  translation''' link you'll see while you are at the translation page of the application you are interested in.

<nowiki>[[File:Download-Translation.png|Downloading a translation from Launchpad|width=1024]]</nowiki>

Once done that, you'll be presented with the download form, where you simply have to choose the default '''PO format''' from the drop-down list and click on the '''Request Download''' button

<nowiki>[[File:Download-PO.png]]</nowiki>

And then you're done! After some time you'll receive an e-mail on the address you've registered on Launchpad containing a direct link to the translation. These links expire after a week.

{i} You'll need a <nowiki>[[https://help.launchpad.net/YourAccount/NewAccount|Launchpad account]]</nowiki> to download single translations.

=== Partial export ===

You can also download only those strings which have been changed in Launchpad, to later merge them to the upstream translations and only send the changes.

The procedure is the same as for <nowiki>[[#Single|single]]</nowiki>, complete translations, but on the last step, you'll have to tick the '''Only strings that differ from imported versions''' checkbox:

<nowiki>[[File:Download-PartialPO.png]]</nowiki>

<nowiki>[[https://help.launchpad.net/Translations/YourProject/PartialPOExport|Here]]</nowiki> you'll find more information on how to use partial PO files.

=== MO file export ===

You can also download binary .mo files. These are the files applications load their translations from, and downloading them can be useful for testing your translation with the running application before the translations have been released in language packs.

The procedure is the same as for <nowiki>[[#Single|single]]</nowiki>, complete translations, but on the last step, you'll have to choose '''MO format''' in the drop-down list:

<nowiki>[[File:Download-MO.png]]</nowiki>

Once you've obtained the e-mail with the link to the download location, you can download the mo file, rename it if necessary (you might have to remove the LANG_LC_MESSAGES_ prefix from the file), and copy it to:

<pre>
/usr/share/locale-langpack/$LANG/LC_MESSAGES/yourfile.mo
</pre>

Where `$LANG` is the two or three letter <nowiki>[[http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php|code]]</nowiki> for your language.

{i} You might have to log out and log back in for the application to load the new translation

== Getting all translations ==

You can also download all translations for a given distro at once. We make the source files available for anyone to download, without the need of a Launchpad account.

If you go to the <nowiki>[[https://translations.launchpad.net/ubuntu/lucid|main translations page]]</nowiki> of a given distro version, you'll see a '''See all language packs''' link.

If you <nowiki>[[https://translations.launchpad.net/ubuntu/lucid/+language-packs|click on the link]]</nowiki>, it will take you to a location where you can see all the tarballs containing PO files which are used as the source for language packs. Downloading those tarballs is an easy way of getting '''all''' translations of a given distro. Note that you should do this only if you really need them, as the tarballs contain translations for all languages and are several hundred MB in size.

There you'll see '''Full language pack''' and '''Delta language pack''' tarballs. The Full language packs contain an export of all translations, whereas the Delta ones only the ones which have changed since the last Full export.

So if you want to have the most recent translations, you'll have to download both the '''Full''' and '''Delta''' exports, and merge the Delta to the Full one. Here's how you can do it:

# '''Download the latest ''Full language pack'' ''' on the list - you can do this by clicking on the link or using a download manager such as `wget`
# '''Download the latest ''Delta language pack'' ''' on the list (generally the top one) - you can do this by clicking on the link or using a download manager such as `wget`
# '''Extract and merge the translations''' - you an do this by right clicking on the downloaded files and uncomplressing them, or quicker by opening a terminal, changing the directory to where you've downloaded the tarballs, and executing the following command:

<pre>
for tarball in ubuntu*translations*.tar.gz; do tar xzf "$tarball"; done
</pre>

After extraction, you'll find all translations (PO files) for your language on the `rosetta-$RELEASE/$LANG` folder, where `$RELEASE` is the Ubuntu release you've downloaded translations for, and `$LANG` the two or three letter <nowiki>[[http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php|code]]</nowiki> for your language.
