=== Instructions ===

Here's how to assemble your own images with live-build running in a cross environment. This works for the nano, developer, alip and ubuntu-desktop images for p & q. I've also created a server image as well.

This does work for older oneiric based images with the exception of ubuntu-desktop due to a mono + qemu bug. 

==== Install Required Packages ====
<pre>
apt-get update
apt-get install live-build 
apt-get install qemu-user-static
</pre>

==== Configure and Build ====
<pre>
mkdir dirforbld  ; cd dirforbld

bzr branch lp:~linaro-maintainers/linaro/live-helper.config.precise.nano  config
bzr branch lp:~linaro-maintainers/linaro/live-helper.config.precise.developer config

cp config/conf_create.sh .

sh ./conf_create.sh
lb build
</pre>
