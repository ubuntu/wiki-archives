== Introduction ==
The Arkansas !LoCo was founded to promote Ubuntu and linux in Arkansas. (In early 2010 the team's name changed in LaunchPad from !TeamArkansas to the Arkansas !LoCo.)
If you use linux, register at launchpad and go to https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-arkansas (If you set your location on the map on your OWN launchpad page, when you join the Arkansas !LoCo we can see what part of the state you're in.)

The Arkansas LoCo forum: http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=208
Anybody with linux can join. All skill levels are welcome. By joining the team, you can gain many linux skills.
