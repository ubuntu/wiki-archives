== Smapi kernel module for newer Thinkpad (works on T42) ==
Ubuntu Dapper provides an hdaps module, but does not provide smapi support as described here: <nowiki>[[http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Tp_smapi]]</nowiki>. I created a package for Dapper which replaces the provided hdaps with a modified version from the smapi package and adds the tp_smapi module. You can find the package here: <nowiki>[[http://www.hackenberger.at/ubuntu_guides/tpsmapi-hdaps-module_1.0_386.deb]]</nowiki>. You can use the tp_smapi /sys/devices/platform/smapi control interface as soon as you have installed the package and issued a modprobe tp_smapi
