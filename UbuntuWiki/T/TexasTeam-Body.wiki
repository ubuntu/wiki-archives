=== Welcome to Texas! ===
Welcome to the home page for the the Ubuntu LoCo Texas Team. We are still i an organizating phase, and are doing our best to get this team flying. Right now we consist of a few people across the state with no formal organization (we're working on that). Feel free to join our mailing lists and Idle in or IRC Channel, and even join us on Launchpad. We are a local community organization, so you don't have to be a Linux professional to join and contribute.
