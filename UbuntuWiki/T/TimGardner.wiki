Hi - My name is Tim Gardner (https://launchpad.net/~timg-tpi). I started at Canonical in February, 2007 on the Ubuntu kernel team. My first project was device enablement on Dell platforms. By maintaining the kernel and other packages I became very familiar with Debian packaging and became a CoreDev by Jan 2008. 

I was the technical lead for the Ubuntu kernel team from approx Jan 2010 until April 2017. During that period I was responsible for new kernels, stable updates, helping to open new releases, etc.

After April 2017 I took a 4 year break. I returned to Canonical in February, 2021. I am now primarily an individual contributor on the Ubuntu cloud team. I help with Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Oracle.
