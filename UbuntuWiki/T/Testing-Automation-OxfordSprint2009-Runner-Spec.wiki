__TOC__

=== Reason ===

ldtprunner is not as maintained as we would like, and it hides some of the errors we would like to see, and shows some others we don't need.

Also it lacks of the difference between a failure and an error, and we would like to have that

=== Design ===

A new log, cleaner and simpler will be created, using minidom, instead of python logger. The XML file that defines the test will be the same as the one that gets the results. Here's an example:

<pre>
<ldtp>
  <suite>
    <case>
      <name>Test UTF Characters</name>
      <description>This test tries to save a file in gedit with UTF8 characters and compares to an oracle file.</description>
      <class>GeditChains</name>
      <method>TestUnicode</method>
      <args>
        <oracle>filetocompare.txt</oracle>
      </args>
      <result>
        <pass>0<pass>
        <error>0</error>
        <message>The files differ.</pass>
        <stacktrace />
        <screenshot>pathtoscreenshot.png</screenshot>
        <time>45.23s</time>
      </result>
    </case>
  </suite>
</ldtp>
</pre>
