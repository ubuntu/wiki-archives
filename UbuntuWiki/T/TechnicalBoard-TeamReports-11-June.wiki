* Meeting 2011-06-02
** Chair: Matt Zimmerman
** Present: Scott James Remnant, Kees Cook
** Apologies: Colin Watson, Mark Shuttleworth
** Meeting transcript and topical links: http://www.novarata.net/mootbot/ubuntu-meeting.20110602_1256.html
** ffmpeg vs. libav
** The ffmpeg project has forked upstream into ffmpeg and libav
** Ubuntu is currently shipping libav only, because the ffmpeg package maintainer chose to package this version
** The consensus of the Technical Board at the meeting was to regard these as separate software projects, which implies:
*** The choice of what to package is rightfully made by the maintainer. The Technical Board does not decide what software individual maintainers choose to package.
*** If another developer wished to package ffmpeg for Ubuntu, this would be welcome
*** If that were to happen, we would address any technical conflicts as they arose
** Setting the Ubuntu series release manager in Launchpad to ubuntu-release
** This was proposed in https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-community/+bug/174375/comments/21
** Bug Bug:451390 is now fixed, so this can proceed
** The TB members present at this meeting did not feel confident enough to make a decision about whether we should proceed immediately, and wanted more input from members familiar with archive administration
** Deferred to the next meeting
** Measuring installation success/failure
** Evan Dandrea proposed that we collect data on successful vs. failed installation attempts from end users
** The TB was asked for a policy ruling on whether this would be acceptable, or under what conditions
** Various concerns have been raised, including:
*** Implementation considerations, such as whether useful data can be collected without leaking identifying information
*** Utility considerations, such as whether this data would in fact be useful for improving the installer
*** Privacy considerations, such as whether it is appropriate require explicit consent from the user before sharing this data
*** Transparency considerations, such as whether the raw data collected should be shared with the general public
** The discussion in the meeting focused mainly on the privacy concerns
** No clear consensus was reached, and clearly more discussion is necessary
** To be continued by email and in the next TB meeting
** Policy proposal for partner repository
** Nicolas Barcet submitted a proposal for a technical policy to be applied to packages in the Canonical partner repository: https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/technical-board/2011-May/000875.html
** There was some discussion of whether this policy should be unified across the Canonical partner repositories and the -extras repositories
** It was suggested that some reference should be made to the Ubuntu Policy Manual
** To be continued by email (time pressure)
** Launchpad stakeholder for Ubuntu project
** Bryce Harrington confirmed his willingness act as a Launchpad stakeholder on behalf of Ubuntu
** ubuntu-techboard celebrity in Launchpad
** Francis Lacoste proposed a code change to Launchpad which would affect the permission model for Ubuntu branches, and asked for input from the technical board
** No issues were raised other than those already raised by James Westby by email

* Meeting 2011-06-30
** Chair: Martin Pitt
** Present: Mark Shuttleworth, Colin Watson, Kees Cook
 
** Setting the Ubuntu series release manager in Launchpad to ubuntu-release 
** No further problems with this expected, Colin agreed to doing the switch
** Things to check:
*** non-release-team core-devs can target tasks to oneiric * (<nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/launchpad/+bug/451390/comments/10|already tested]]</nowiki>)
*** non-core-dev release team members can modify oneiric milestones
 
** Measuring installation success/failure, <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/technical-board/2011-June/000935.html|updated proposal from Evan Dandrea]]</nowiki>
** the purpose of collecting the data is to make Ubuntu better
** while we won't make the data entirely public (avoiding unexpected privacy concerns, and competitive questions), people with technical/research projects who have a need for it can ask the TB for data (this includes Canonical employees)
** for opt-out we need to write a privacy policy
** people who are concerned about what data we're collecting can of course examine the client source code; we won't correlate IP addresses with this
** we need to discuss data security (against theft) with IS
** This proposal, under above conditions, got 4 out of 4 votes from the present TB members; for the record, Scott James Remnant mentioned that he'd prefer having all the data being public
 
** <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/technical-board/2011-June/000915.html|SRU microrelease exception for Banshee]]</nowiki>
** Upstream clarified and documented patch backporting and QA policy: https://live.gnome.org/Banshee/StableReleasesPolicy
** Got 4 out of 4 votes from the present TB members, accepted; wiki page updated accordingly
 
** <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/technical-board/2011-June/000944.html|DMB voting procedure]]</nowiki> was discussed quickly, but we ran out of time. Will be discussed via email or carried to next meeting.
 
** <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/technical-board/2011-May/000875.html|Policy proposal for partner repository]]</nowiki>: Ran out of time, carried to next meeting.
