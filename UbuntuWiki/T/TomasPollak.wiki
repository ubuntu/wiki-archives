__TOC__

Switched from Vector to Ubuntu since 5.10. From time to time, tests other distros only to find out another reason why Ubuntu is number one. Writes about Linux and stuff in two blogs, <nowiki>[[http://bootlog.cl]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[http://fayerwayer.com]]</nowiki>. Is thinking about composing a song about Open Source (or perhaps Ubuntu). Shakes hands with you in this very moment.
