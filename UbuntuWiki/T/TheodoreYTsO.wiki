__TOC__

== Me ==

I am Theodore Ts'o.   I am a kernel developer and upstream (and Debian) maintainer of e2fsprogs.  My day job is at the IBM Linux Technology Center, where I am currently serving as the Real-Time Linux Architect.  I am currently leading a team which is developing a productized version of Ingo Molnar's patchset to support a Real-Time Java product, Websphere Real-Time, with a garbage collector that has a minimum pause time of 1ms.  Cool stuff!  It means that I get to work on my hobby and get paid for it, which is definitely a real blessing.

I currently run Ubuntu on my Laptop, and I like it very much!
