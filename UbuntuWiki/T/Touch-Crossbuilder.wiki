== Crossbuilder ==

Crossbuilder aims at making cross compiling code and deploying projects to devices simple, reliable and most importantly fast. It uses LXD containers and ccache by default.

Homepage: https://launchpad.net/crossbuilder

<pre>
bzr branch lp:crossbuilder
cd crossbuilder
./crossbuilder help
</pre>

To build and deploy your project on the device connected to your computer all in one go:
<pre>
cd yourproject/
crossbuilder
</pre>

Change a line of code and type <code>crossbuilder</code> again to re-build and re-deploy.

To go even faster, bypass building Debian packages with:
<pre>
crossbuilder --no-deb
</pre>

For an even faster LXD setup, resetup LXD using ZFS:
<pre>
crossbuilder setup-lxd
</pre>

To enter the LXD container used to build:
<pre>
crossbuilder shell
</pre>
