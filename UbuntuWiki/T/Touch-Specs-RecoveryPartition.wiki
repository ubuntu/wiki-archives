== Recovery Partition ==

Ubuntu Touch will implement an image-based update procedure that relies on the recovery partition to effect the upgrade of the main system partition.  As a result, there are specific requirements for the contents of the recovery partition.  This is a draft specification intended to detail those requirements.

=== Key Requirements ===
* The recovery image must implement <nowiki>[[ImageBasedUpgrades-Upgrader]]</nowiki> to support image-based upgrades of Ubuntu Touch.
* The recovery image must support re-flashing of the device from scratch using signed Ubuntu Touch images.
* The community version of the recovery image must support replacing Ubuntu Touch images with the original Android images, for compatibility.

=== Solutions ===

==== Current Implementation ====
The current recovery images provided by Ubuntu Touch are based on Cyanogenmod with minimal modifications.

==== Proposed Implementation ====
'''FIXME'''
