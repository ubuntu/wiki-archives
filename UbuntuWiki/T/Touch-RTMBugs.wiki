== Defect Management for RTM ==

=== Objective ===
When entering the RC phase, we want to tightly manage code changes that are entering the product image in order to keep stability up and ensure that only (customer) critical bugs get addressed.

=== Process ===
1. The Product Team, in line with the Landing Team and QA will announce the beginning of this phase
2. The Product Team will provide a list of targeted remaining and existing bugs
3. The Landing Team will only allow landings that are addressing the mentioned issues from 2.
4. Newly reported bugs need to be tagged with the respective product tag (rtm14 atm) and will be reviewed by the Product Team to be included in the list of targeted bugs
4.1. Regressions of fixes from 2. are likely to be waived
4.2. Entirely new bugs revealed in the process will be assessed more thoroughly
