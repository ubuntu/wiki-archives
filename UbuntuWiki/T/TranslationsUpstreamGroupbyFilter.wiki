=== Summary ===
Template's list for translation, for each language on Rosetta, isn't sorted, filtered or grouped. Trying to group it by upstream (ex: GNOME, KDE, XFCE, etc) may make easy to check the status of the translation for people translating on specific area.

=== Rationale ===
A good translation came also from a good knowledge of the application. Free Software's translators are primary smart user of that software. Translating Ubuntu on Rosetta it's a little disorienting, starting from this vision, cause there's PO files from different sources in one, and single, view.

The image below show the EDGY's PO List for translation.
 
<nowiki>[[File:PO_List_It.jpg]]</nowiki>

On first's lines there's packages from very different upstream: 
* debian-installer (Debian)
* launchpad-integration (UBUNTU related package)
* gnome-applets-2.0, gnome-desktop-2.0, gnome-menus, etc (GNOME)
* kdelibs, kicker, etc (KDE)
* etc

Statistic (on left column box) refers to entire packages list, without inform which packages need urgent work and which distribution will affect (Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Xubuntu, all)

=== Further Details ===
* upsteam selector for a list of upstream filtered packages
* statistic related to filtered packages. (left column box)
* upstream in the file detail column when there's no upstream selection

=== Use Cases ===
* Paul is a Kubuntu enthusiast and work as translator for Dutch group. Bookmarking KDE packages stay on touch with the status of Kubuntu related translation. 
* John is an Italian GNOME translator. He focus his work on GNOME upstream packages using "GNOME" filtering.
* Henry is a French Ubuntu coordinator. He verify with upstream filter the status of translation for ALL packages group.
