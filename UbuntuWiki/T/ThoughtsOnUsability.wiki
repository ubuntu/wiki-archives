== Thoughts on Usability ==

At the moment I see some, partially very bad, usability problems within the Hoary Hedgehog Release that at the moment do not seem to be fixed in Breezy.

* Bad included documentation:
At the moment we have some really bad documentation included. The two pages by the Ubuntu are translated in a very ugly way, with lots of failures. I think these failures advance from the way these articles were translated. It looks as if it was translated sentence for sentence, word by word and not in the aggregate. The other problem I see (this was the minor one) is the following: we really ''have'' high quality howtos and articles. But not in Yelp but in the wikis. What do we need an wiki article for telling me how to set up an internet connection? The article is published on the internet, I would need to boot another operating system or ask a friend to use his computer. We need to include articles from the wikis. It should be possible to convert XHTML pages to Yelp pages. Should not it? It's also important to include the documentation in the users language. It is generally speaking better to include no documentation than foreign language ones. Foreign languages startle the users and it is not in  line with the ambition of the Ubuntu Project.

* Not enough administration tools:
The idea not to have a whole bunch of tools to administer the system is broadly fine, as it helps not to confuse the user. But using a terminal is more confusing than having a System->Administration menu with a few more entries. My idea is to let the menu untouched and deliver the additive system tools on the cd and copy them to a local repository so the user can install them without an internet connection or the CD. A small programme in the administrative menu to install additional tools would make things an children's game.
