=== Joining a Translation Team ===

Translating Ubuntu is a rewarding experience: it allows you to bring a localized system in your language to potentially millions of people.  This also carries a degree of responsibility: we want to provide the best applications with the best translations around, which is why we put an emphasis on their quality.

Everyone with a Launchpad account can submit translation suggestions. While this is great for collaboration and for lowering the barrier to contribution, it is necessary to have some kind of peer reviewing mechanism to make sure these suggestions are correct and that the final user will understand them when using Ubuntu.

The role of translation teams is to have a set of members who are experienced translators review these suggestions, accept them if appropriate and come back to the submitter for feedback. They also take care of helping new translators get their bearings on their journey to becoming full-fledged Ubuntu translators.

Even if you don't want to join a translation team, it is always recommended to get in touch with them when you've finished submitting some suggestions, so that they are aware of them and they can review them.

It's very easy to get in touch with them: on every translation page there is a link to the team. You can scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on the link after the This translation is managed by label, which will take you to the team's home page in Launchpad, containing info on how to contact them.
