=== Summary ===

Totem and Rhythmbox are gnome's default movie and music player, so one would think that their interface should follow similar guidelines, in order not to confuse the user. But this is not the case.

=== Rationale ===

The HIG 2.0 say: "Show separate Stop and Pause buttons. Do not change Play to Pause while the clip is playing."

When playing, Rhythmbox's play button stays pressed. Totem's, on the other hand, turns into a pause button.

Also, rolling the mouse wheel in either app gives opposite results: rolling it up advances the media in Totem but rewinds it in RB, and vice versa.

=== Use cases ===

-David is listening to some songs in Rhythmbox. He wants to pause the music because his girlfriend wants to talk to him and he can't hear what she's saying, but he can't find the pause button. He thinks that it must be around because he has seen it in Totem, and wonders if you can't stop the music in RB at all without closing the program.

-Susana and David are watching a Jackie Chan movie in Totem. David asks her to rewind the movie just a bit, because he missed something and wants to see it again. She scrolls the wheel up but the movie goes forward instead. She doesn't know why this is happening, cause she knows that the same behaviour rewinds the songs.

=== Implementation ===

For coherence's sake, one of both methods should be chosen as better and applied to both apps. I'd go for RB's, and make Totem's play button look like this when playing:

Not only because I like it better, but also because I don't think that pause really exists as a state. Either you're playing the media, or you aren't.

Also, we should discuss is Totem's behaviour when scrolling the wheel is coherent with other gnome apps. I would say no, since scrolling down always moves towards the end of the media / document.
