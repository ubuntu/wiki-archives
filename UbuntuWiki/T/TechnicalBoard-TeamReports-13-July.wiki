== Meeting 2013-07-22 ==

* Attendees: Martin Pitt (chair), Kees Cook, Matt Zimmerman, Colin Watson, Soren Hansen, Stéphane Graber
* Guests: Rick Spencer, Scott Kitterman, Stefan Bader

* Action review:
** Kees to review outstanding provisional MREs -- carried over

* Development series alias name
** We concluded the discussion from the previous meetings (see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TechnicalBoard/TeamReports/13/June), and after much back and forth discussion between the three candidates "rolling", "next", and "devel", the TB voted for ''devel''.

* SRU MRE: Xen
** Provisional MRE was granted, with the constraint that some formal testing procedures should be discussed in the first SRU. This could be something like "boot the last N releases/LTS default install and verify some list of things (networking, file system test suite, etc.)"

* SRU: Extend the KDE MRE
** Scott proposed an <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/technical-board/2013-July/001666.html|extension of the existing KDE microrelease exception]]</nowiki> to cover non-core applications.
** The list was granted for MRE except lightdm-kde, as regressions there have a potentially disastrous effect. That particular package will be reviewed once there is an actual new microrelease to consider.
