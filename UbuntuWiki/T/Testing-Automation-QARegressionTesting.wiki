=== Introduction ===

The QA-Regression-Testing project is a testing framework and set of tests originally developed by the SecurityTeam to help ensure that security updates didn't introduce regressions into the updated packages; it has been adopted by the <nowiki>[[QATeam|QATeam]]</nowiki> to assist with our testing. It is intended to capture functional tests and is implemented as a set of python-unit tests. The source repository is available at 
<nowiki>[[https://code.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-bugcontrol/qa-regression-testing/master|lp:qa-regression-testing]]</nowiki>.
