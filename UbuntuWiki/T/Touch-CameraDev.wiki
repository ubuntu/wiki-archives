=== Getting a Camera Development Environment Set Up ===

1. For Android/Hybris changes, make sure you have the tree: phablet-dev-bootstrap (this will download around 15 GB of data so be patient)
2. Branch lp:qtubuntu-camera
3. Branch lp:camera-app

=== Working with the Source ===

1. Camera Ubuntu Android-side code lives in android/ubuntu/lihybris/compat/camera for most of it; the code for video recording lives in android/ubuntu/libhybris/compat/media
2. Camera Ubuntu Hybris-side code lives in android/ubuntu/libhybris/hybris/camera
3. qtubuntu-camera is a Qt plugin library that provides several control implementations that sit in between QML/Qt high level interfaces and Hybris. It is responsible for making the appropriate calls into Hybris to control the camera hardware.
