=== Test notes ===

* '''[1]''' Rebundle testing cannot be done without Amazon S3. Doing so seems to work, but produces a ''running'' instance that can not do anything useful.
* '''[2]''' <nowiki>[[Testing-EC2-Results-10192009MTrudel-postfix|An additional test with Postfix was performed]]</nowiki>, successfully.
* '''[3]''' Added additional step in test case to run ''smbtree'', which seems to give a good idea that samba works, at least more than checking just the PID.
