'''Task name: tpcc''' 

'''Description: Test Print CD Cover''' 

'''Procedure: For developing this test page'''
* What needs to be changed
** Identify where the current test page is located
** Design the actual test page
** Get buy in on this new page
** Submit this to the community

* Oragami
** This process needs to work for both ISO "A" size paper and
** Standard U.S. Letter.

'''Comments:'''
=== Use Case ===
* Why do we need a new test page?
** The printer test page that comes out of the printer is a waste of paper.
** What we need to do is not waste this paper.  I am constantly making copies of Ubuntu CD's and also never can find a slipcase to protect it, so the CD gets scratched.  If the printer test page could be folded into a cd cover I would be very happy, getting better copies of the distribution, I would be saving making a new cd as well as saving paper.
