=== Contributions ===

I'm one of the principle architects and developers for <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/autopilot|Ubuntu Autopilot]]</nowiki> as well as related packages (libautopilot-qt, libautopilot-gtk, libxpathselect). These tools are our main tool for writing acceptance tests for all the graphical Ubuntu Touch applications. In my time working for Canonical, I've also contributed to the Unity 7 and mir server codebases. My role as a QA engineer sees me contributing to a large number of projects on a daily basis.

I've attended all the UDS events (both physical and virtual) since 12.04, and actively help shape the future of the distribution.

=== Future Plans ===

I will continue the work I currently do as autopilot maintainer, and active member of the Ubuntu QA effort. 

=== Testimonials ===

==== Nicholas Skaggs ====
Thomi has played an active role in helping shape our current QA processes surrounding automated testing. In addition to maintaining the tool we've adopted for use, he has been active in soliciting and responding to feedback on autopilot from the QA community. This has taken the shape of adding useful features to enable better test-writing and continuous support for anyone using autopilot in #ubuntu-autopilot. He's directly helped ensure autopilot worked properly with ubiquity so the automated installer testing could proceed, and given examples of best practices to follow when writing tests and using autopilot. He's contributed help to the autopilot helper for the ubuntu sdk applications, as well as reviewed and contributed to the tests themselves. The community core apps wouldn't be the same without his help and guidance. 

Overall, Thomi is valued contributor to quality and an important piece in our continuing efforts to test all the things! He's a vocal advocate for quality everywhere and has the knowledge and skills to back it up. I encourage you to look favorably upon his application for membership. -- '''balloons''' 2014-03-14

==== Martin Pitt ====

Autpilot has become a pillar in Ubuntu's QA. I consider that alone a (more than) sufficient contribution, but Thomi has also been very active in defining QA processes, improving tests, helping other developers with setting up tests, knows our Ubuntu release processes, and diligently maintains his packages. I welcome Thomi to become an Ubuntu member (it's overdue ☺) and want to thank him for his contributions!

==== Marco Trevisan ====
 
Thomi's committment in the the Ubuntu project has been sustained for years, since his involvement in the distro he put all his efforts and knowledge to make "Quality" an actual keyword of the ubuntu echosystem, building the Autopilot tool that made possible - for the first time - to automatize user interactions and verify expectations.
This really made possible to test our user interface in a way that was not possible before.

Also his accuracy, quality focus, and good code practices helped his colleagues to improve their work.
