* Feedback whether Rosetta is really useful for Kubuntu

* Different Translation guidelines between KDE and Gnome
** Translations in GNOME that diverge from upstream are analysed by the ubuntu translators that are reviewer and only accepted as official if appropriated. This doesn't work for KDE?
*** Is there any co-ordination between KDE upstream and translation teams to allow such issues to be resolved?
*** Not in Brazil, but we should, or kubuntu-translators should be a separated team with their own reviewers.
    
* QA'ing language packs:
** Comparing imported language packs and exported language packs (Danilo, David)
** This will reveal whether there are many translation teams differing from upstreams in terms of translated strings

* kde-l10n-xx should be installed in karmic by default by language-selector (see "pkg_depends" file in source)
