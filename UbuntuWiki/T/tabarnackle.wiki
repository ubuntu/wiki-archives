I am building this wiki as an introduction to page building. Something I never got wrapped up in aside from creating a facebook page. I guess learning to "code" was just difficult looking to me. But we will see. After all, we must all start somewhere. Just like learning how to effectivley use a new OS for your purposes. My purposes are apparently webpage building and just the fact that Ubuntu runs better than "Windoze" lol''
