__TOC__

I am the founder/editor/webmaster/columnist of The News Source (TNS). TNS was started in 2001. Our website is http://www.thenewssource.org and my website is at http://john.thenewssource.org/.

The first open source software I used was Firefox. The next oss I used was OpenOffice.org followed by The Gimp. I found Ubuntu after looking through (and trying) several distributions in about November 2005. I continued to use Ubuntu on and off until December 2006. In January 2007 I installed Ubuntu 7.04 Feisty Fawn (Herd 2) and since then use Ubuntu full-time.

In addition to computers and TNS I also garden, bike ride, and lots of other things. I am also involved with our church's youth and youth leadership team.

I am currently head of the Ubuntu Ohio Communication Team and helped update the Ohio Team's website at http://www.ohio.ubuntu-us.org.
