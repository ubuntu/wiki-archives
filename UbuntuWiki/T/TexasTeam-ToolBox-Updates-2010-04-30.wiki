== Austin: Lucid Release Party ==
==== Occasion ====
Lucid release! (that sounds so bad... I'm keeping it)

What better reason to meet our local LoCos than the LTS release of Ubuntu?

==== Venue ====
Location: <nowiki>[[http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=11262780444816579605&q=mean+eyed+cat&hl=en&cd=1&ei=5bfES8CDHqigjgOOsYA_&sig2=TWf9314e4du6Y5gH21Sa6Q&sll=30.230696,-97.713932&sspn=0.105276,0.122322&ie=UTF8&ll=30.362508,-97.834625&spn=0,0&z=12&iwloc=A|Mean Eyed Cat]]</nowiki>

Time: 6pm, till we've had enough?
