=== Tests ===

For every test, start file-roller new, for example by opening a terminal (Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal) and running the "file-roller" command from there.

==== Creating an archive ====
# Make sure that in your home directory there is no file named "fr-test-archive-1.tar.gz" (remove/rename it if necessary)
# Click Archive -> New
# Enter "fr-test-archive-1" as name
# Verify that target folder is set to your home directory, and that type is set to "Automatic", and click New
# Click Edit -> Add Files
# (TBD: add some directories as well)
# Select the file "/etc/issue" and click OK
# Verify that an archive with name "fr-test-archive-1.tar.gz" has been created in your home directory
# Verify that the file is a valid tar.gz archive:
## Run "tar tzf ~/fr-test-archive-1.tar.gz" in a terminal, and verify that the output is exactly "issue"
## Run "tar xzf ~/fr-test-archive-1.tar.gz -O" in a terminal, and verify that the output is exactly the content of the /etc/issue file

==== Opening .tar.gz archive ====
# Make sure that there is no "/tmp/issue" file (remove/rename it if necessary)
# Click Archive -> Open
# Select the file "fr-test-archive-1.tar.gz" from your home directory
# Verify that a single "issue" file is shown
# Click Archive -> Extract
# Select Other -> /tmp/ as target directory
# Click Extract
# Verify that the file /tmp/issue exists now and that it has the same content as /etc/issue:
## Run "diff /tmp/issue /etc/issue; echo $?" in a terminal and verify that it prints only a "0"

==== Creating an archive in a remote directory (samba/ftp/http/sftp) ====

==== Opening an archive from a remote directory (samba/ftp/http/sftp) ====
(regression test for bugs like <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/file-roller/+bug/263026|LP 263026]]</nowiki>)

==== Opening an archive that is contained in another archive ====
(test case: an archive contains another nested archive; when trying to open the nested archive, a second file-roller window should be started)

==== Previewing a file from an archive ====
(test that it is possible to double-click on text files/images/audio files in an archive and have the file opened in gedit/eog/totem/other appropriate application)

==== Opening an ISO file ====
(test that .iso files can be opened in file-roller)
