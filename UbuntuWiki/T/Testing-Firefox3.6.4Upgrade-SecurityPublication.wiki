This page contains the notes and procedures that will be used for publishing the USNs for the firefox 3.6 transitions.

=== USNs ===
The packages and USNs for nss, nspr, firefox 3.6.6 and firefox 3.6.6 rdepends will be published at the same time for Ubuntu 8.04 LTS and 10.04 LTS, and then later for 9.04 and 9.10 (due to openjdk issue). While packages for epiphany/webkit were backported from 9.10 to 8.04 LTS, they had too many regressions over the functionality provided by epiphany/gecko. As an alternative, epiphany was updated to use the new xulrunner-1.9.2. 9.10 already has the latest nss.

Ubuntu was originally targeting 3.6.4 for the transition, but shortly after release or 3.6.4, upstream issued an emergency bug fix release with 3.6.6, so we are now targeting 3.6.6 for the transition.

0. USN numbers greater than -1 are subject to change based on regression fixes
** 930-3 is for LP: #600022

=== Publication ===
In general, follow <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/UpdatePublication|SecurityTeam/UpdatePublication]]</nowiki> with the following exceptions:
* use the above table to determine the ```SRCPKG``` for each USN
* use ```--ppa=ubuntu-mozilla-security``` with ```unembargo.py``` and ```copy_sppa_to_repos```
* be sure to clean out ```new-usn.sh``` for unrelated items. Eg, USN-927-4 should '''only''' have nss for 8.04 LTS and 930-1 should '''only''' have firefox-3.0 for hardy. Verify these against what is listed in USNs, above
* run ```copy-report``` manually on cocoplum

==== Release Notes ====
The following USNs have release note specific items:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <20%>'''USN'''
| Note
|-
| 930-1

|-
| 930-1
| Upgrades to Ubuntu 8.10 from Ubuntu 8.04 LTS may break the browser. Ubuntu 8.10 is no longer supported so users will need to upgrade to 9.04 to receive active security support and a functional browser.
|-
| 930-1, 930-4
| Font configuration cannot be controlled via Gnome settings. This is a known issue being tracked in https://launchpad.net/bugs/559149 and will be fixed in a later update.
|-
| 930-1, 930-4
| helix-player is not currently supported in firefox 3.6. This is a known issue and may be fixed in a future update.
|-
| 930-1
| !RealAudio via the totem plugin is no longer supported in firefox 3.6 in Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. Affected users navigating to Real content will be prompted to install optional community supported packages.
|-
| 930-1
| In Ubuntu 8.04 LTS the xine plugin is non-functional. After upgrading to Firefox 3.6, the plugin may cause the browser to crash, while in Firefox 3.0 it would be silently ignored. Users are advised to uninstall xine-plugin and/or gxineplugin.
|-
| 930-1, 930-4
| After upgrading to Firefox 3.6.6, users may be prompted to upgrade some 3rd party Add-Ons. In some cases, an Add-On will not be compatible with Firefox 3.6.6 and have no update available. In these cases, Firefox will notify the user that it is disabling the Add-On.

| 930-X '''REJECTED'''
| epiphany now uses webkit exclusively. This results in changes in behavior including no prompts for untrusted SSL certs (only broken lock) and CA certificate imports are done system-wide in /etc/ssl/certs as opposed to per user. Plugins are no longer listed via 'about:plugins', 'Use image as background' is no longer available. Javascript heavy applications like maps.google.com do not work.

==== Making sure you have the latest packages ====
The ubuntu-mozilla-security PPA is being updated regularly with bug fixes and backports. To make sure you have the latest packages for testing locally, you can use the following shell script :<pre>
set -e

repo="/var/www/debs/testing"
output="$HOME/ums.list"

force_update=""
if [ "$1" = "-u" ]; then
    force_update="yes"
    shift
fi

tmpdir=`mktemp -d`
trap "rm -rf $tmpdir" EXIT HUP INT QUIT TERM
if [ "$force_update" = "yes" ] || [ ! -e "$output" ]; then
    echo "Downloading package list from ubuntu-mozilla-security to '$output'."
    echo "(this will take a while)"
    ls-ppa --ppa=ubuntu-mozilla-security > "$tmpdir/ums.list"
    mv -f "$tmpdir/ums.list" "$output"
fi

if [ -z "$1" ]; then
     echo "Need to specify a release" >&2
     exit
fi
ums_release="$1"

cat "$output" | grep "$ums_release" | grep -v language | sed -e 's/: / /' -e "s/ ($ums_release)//" | sort > "$tmpdir/remote"
mv -f "$tmpdir/remote" /tmp/remote."$ums_release"

ls -1 "$repo/$ums_release/"*source.changes | sed -e 's#.*/##g' -e 's/_/ /g' -e 's/ source.changes//' | sort > "$tmpdir/local"
mv -f "$tmpdir/local" /tmp/local."$ums_release"

diff -Nau /tmp/remote."$ums_release" /tmp/local."$ums_release"
</pre>

The basic idea with the above is that you have a local apt repository where you download all the latest packages (see <nowiki>[[http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-security/ubuntu-security-tools/trunk/annotate/head:/repo-tools/copy_sppa_to_repos|copy_sppa_to_repos]]</nowiki> and then you use <nowiki>[[http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-bugcontrol/ubuntu-qa-tools/master/annotate/head:/security-tools/ls-ppa|ls-ppa]]</nowiki> to generate a listing of the PPA and compare that to what is in your local repository for a specific release. Eg:<pre>
$ ./tmp/ums-diff -u hardy
Downloading package list from ubuntu-mozilla-security to '/home/<user>/ums.list'.
