'''Installation through Windows 7:''' 

'''Description: Installing Ubuntu through Windows 7 on dell 1464 with intel i3 processor''' 

'''Procedure:'''

 I have dell 1464 laptop with intel i3 processor and windows7.

I tried installing Ubuntu 9.10 from Windows7. When I restarted my computer & booted from Ubuntu, I got blank screen.

 

Then, I tried for Ubuntu 10.04 Beta version, but when selected this OS after restart, I got the GRUB command prompt.

After that I fired a command to exit, I got the msg 'Operating System is missing'
I am not sure but think the problem is with dell 1464 hardware only its not supporting OS
