Describe Tekkris here...

Okay, I am just a user.  Maybe this will get updated one day with more information but I doubt it will be me that does it.  

What I do for Ubuntu?
Well I use it.  I am not a programmer in any sense other than basic shell scripting (bash, sh, ksh) and a little perl.  I am a UNIX admin and I do use Ubuntu both at home and at work.  

Since stormix (wow that was a while ago) I have wanted a decent debian based OS that was simple to use with little effort or knowledge and this has done it for me.  I used to be a Red Hat lover but now all that has changed and Ubuntu is my choice as well as the distro that I recommend for many people.

Anyway, I am trying to blabber here and one day I will add more but for now this will do.  I just want to support this great project where I can and maybe this is it.
