** <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/technical-board/2010-September/000506.html|SRU microrelease exception for bzr]]</nowiki>
** Requirement: Run selftests during package build to catch architecture specific regressions, and catch problems early
** Run tests on installed package as part of SRU verification
*** '''ACTION:''' Martin Pitt to ask Martin Pool about self test instructions on installed system
*** '''ACTION:''' Kees to add bzr self test to qa-regression-testing project
** Under those conditions, the request was unanimously approved
*** '''ACTION:''' Martin add to StableReleasePolicy

** Chromium security updates  
** Discussion has shown that a general SRU exception is the only viable way
** It is not realistic to do any serious testing on these, since updates are released so fast; updates need to happen pretty much "blindly"
** This makes it rather inappropriate for main/default install, but as an opt-in in universe the current experience with the recent Chromium SRUs showed that the process is working
** In case of new build dependencies: in general they should be bundled, but for some of them it is okay to update the system package (e. g. gyp, and perhaps libvpx); this is a case-by-case decision

** No new community bugs to look at

** Next chair: Mark Shuttleworth
