I'm new to the wiki, and just starting to get 'involved' in the community

I'm an electronic engineer by profession - involved in telecommunications for the last 30 years.

I used to design microprocessor-based systems (now referred to as 'embedded') and code in machine code ;) and assembler, and unix systems in the early '80s

I came back to the unix world with the advent of linux, and have been using (K)ubuntu since Breezy. (Since SuSE p***ed me off by selling out to Novell)
