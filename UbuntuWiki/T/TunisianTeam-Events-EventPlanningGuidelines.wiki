__TOC__


This wiki page will outline the main steps necessary to setup a local Ubuntu event in which people meet up and some instructors show the attendees how to get involved with the LoCo Team activities. Not only are these events extremely valuable in attracting new volunteers, but they also represent a funny way of getting interested people together and enhancing the added value of sharing knowledge with an open spirit.

We will offer a simple guide to running a successful Tunisian Ubuntu event by giving you a practical information and a good material on setting up events and a way to instruct people at the event itself.
