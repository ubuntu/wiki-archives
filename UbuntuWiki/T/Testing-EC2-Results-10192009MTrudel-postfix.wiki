__TOC__

One additional test was performed to properly verify Postfix's installation.

* When installing, I chose 'Internet site'. Following this rationale, messages should be sendable to the outside world, barring possible spam-filtering-related issues.

Test was run manually, by speaking SMTP to Postfix:

The message was successfully received (although treated as spam, as expected):
