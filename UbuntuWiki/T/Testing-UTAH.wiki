__TOC__



== General Info ==

UTAH Documentation is at:
* http://utah.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html
For test case development, provisioning a machine for each test run induces a lot of overhead, so it is possible to develop test suites as they can be run by hand using the appropriate runlist.

   sudo utah -r <RUNLIST>

== Server Specific ==

Ubuntu Server UTAH tests are at the Ubuntu Test Automation Harness Launchpad Project:
* https://code.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-server-dev/utah/server-tests-quantal

== Feedback ==

Please put any feedback folks find here.
