=== Community Council ===
* CC Meeting, 3rd March 2009:
** Status Update on people.ubuntu.com / people.canonical.com transition from James Troup: what needs doing is clearly specified, the only hairy part is transitioning the existing contents (obviously, don't want to break URLs), James needs to find resource/time to write the code and implement it. James will try and push that forward, we have to keep existing links working (so people.ubuntu.com/~james will 302 to people.canonical.com/~james - that's only scary in terms of a) the mapping, and b) apt not following redirects), quotas will probably come later
* CC Meeting, 17th March 2009
