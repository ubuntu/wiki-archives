__TOC__


== Session Notes ==

<pre>
== Increasing community contributions in LP Translations development ==

* LP focus is upstream integration
* Any other feature requests will not be serviced by LP team due to lack of time
* We want those interested in new features to develop them!
* Only one contribution from an upstream project maintainer

=== Problems ===

* Community starting from zero
* Most translators are not technical and can't develop
* There are some technical translators who could help
* Some developers complain but don't know they can help
* Getting LP up and running is not as easy
* There are people who might be interested in starting to develop, but don't know how to start

=== What is there already ===

* dev.launchpad.net
* #launchpad-dev on FreeNode, launchpad-dev mailing list on launchpad.net
* blog.launchpad.net syndicated into planet.ubuntu.com

=== Actions ===

* get a list of trivial bugs (https://bugs.launchpad.net/rosetta/+bugs?field.tag=trivial) (Danilo)
* added information to https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Launchpad about developing Launchpad itself, can be elaborated
* get a better reference/sample database (like staging)
* fix a bug / add a new feature (not something big) and then make a BIG announcement and encourage new developers. Let them know that this can be done ... and it is not that hard
** UWN, Fridge, Full Circle Magazine, Ubuntu User - David to contact Amber on getting the word out
* Idea: develop a simple "hello world" app, even a screencast people can start on

* ACTION: Adi/Danilo to install lp.dev and then add last-updated column into +templates page
           Do a write up of how it went, and what it involved.
