===== MOTU Council =====
* <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~nvalcarcel|Nicolas Valcárcel]]</nowiki> has been doing fantastic work, the feedback to his application has been great, the MC was only too happy to deem him ready for joining the Universe Contributors team.
* <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~christophe.sauthier|Christophe Sauthier]]</nowiki> has been active in a lot of areas of Ubuntu, MOTU being one of them. We're happy we can add him to the Universe Contributors team now.
* <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~bobbo|David Futcher]]</nowiki> has done a lot of good work in the last months and his sponsors immediately gave good feedback on his application. We're happy he's now member of the Universe Contributors team.
* Having been involved in Ubuntu for several releases, <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~onkarshinde|Onkar Shinde]]</nowiki> lived up to the challenge of Java packaging. He has done a lot of amazing work and it was time he joined the Universe Contributors team.
* <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~gaspa|Andrea Gasparini]]</nowiki> has done great work and the feedback on his application has been very much in favour for him, thus was deemed ready to join the Universe Contributors team.
* <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~james-w|James Westby]]</nowiki> has been a key part of the MOTU community for some time, and has now also joined the Universe Contributors team.
* MC 'Call', Aug 13th 2008
** Open Applications: Dustin Kirkland (MOTU), Nicolas Valcárcel (MOTU)
** Discussed counselling of a potentially overeager contributor.
** Briefly discussed proceedings and processes of the ArchiveReorganisation spec. The next TB meeting should shed more light on this.
** Noted that both motu-sru and motu-release teams are short on members.
* Nicolas Valcárcel (also known as nxvl) has joined the MOTU team. He has done great work in the Server team, is the star of a Spanish packaging video and is involved in various places in the MOTU team.
* MC Meeting, Aug 20th 2008
** Open Applications: Dustin Kirkland (MOTU), Fabien Tassin (MOTU), Iain Lane (UUC)
** MOTU Council voting procedures
** Due to confusions with recent application processing, MC will be adopting the following interim changes to the application processing procedure.  It is expected that more discussion on this topic will happen in the future.
** There will be a new 168-hour window for MOTU discussion, which may be closed early if all listed sponsors for an application have responded.
** At the conclusion of this period, MOTU Council members will be expected to vote, although discussion may continue until all Council members have either voted or stated their intention not to vote.  Only once all feedback from MOTU Council has been received will applications be processed as complete.
** Additional discussion mirroring mailing list discussions regarding applications for MOTU vs. applications for Core-Dev, and the various requirements that ought be applied in either case.  This discussion was inconclusive, and will likely be taken up again, largely informed by the ongoing discussions on the mailing list.
