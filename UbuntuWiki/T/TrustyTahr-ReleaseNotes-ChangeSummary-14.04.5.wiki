__TOC__


This is a brief summary of bugs fixed between Ubuntu 14.04.4 and 14.04.5.  '''This summary covers only changes to packages in ''__main__'' and ''__restricted__'', which account for all packages in the officially-supported CD images; there are further changes to various packages in ''universe'' and ''multiverse''.'''  Some of these fixes were by Ubuntu developers directly, while others were by upstream developers and backported to Ubuntu.  For full details, see the individual package changelogs.

In addition to the bugs listed below, this update includes all security updates from the <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/trusty|Ubuntu Security Notice list]]</nowiki> affecting Ubuntu 14.04 LTS that were released up to and including August 2, 2016.  The last update included was USN-3045-1 (PHP vulnerabilities).

=== Installation bug fixes ===

Updated CD images are provided with this release, including fixes for some installation bugs.  (Many installation problems are hardware-specific; for those, see "Hardware support bugs" below.)

=== Upgrade bug fixes ===

These changes fix upgrade issues, smoothing the way for future upgrades to later releases of Ubuntu.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| systemd
| Bug:1535255
| debian/extra/initramfs.hook: Fix typo in path of udevadm.upgrade : The binary is /bin/udevadm.upgrade while udev is unpacked and not configured (see debian/udev.{pre,post}inst. (LP: #1535255)

|-
| apt
| Bug:1560797
| Recheck Pre-Depends satisfaction in SmartConfigure, to avoid unconfigured Pre-Depends (which dpkg later fails on). Fixes upgrade failures of systemd, util-linux, and other packages with Pre-Depends. Many thanks to David Kalnischkies for figuring out the patch and Winfried PLappert for testing! Patch taken from Debian git. (LP: #1560797)
|-
| apt
| Bug:1575877
| When using the https transport mechanism, $no_proxy is ignored if apt is getting it's proxy information from $https_proxy (as opposed to Acquire::https::Proxy somewhere in apt config). If the source of proxy information is Acquire::https::Proxy set in apt.conf (or apt.conf.d), then $no_proxy is honored. This patch makes the behavior similar for both methods of setting the proxy. (LP: #1575877)
