I'm interested in setting up a rather thorough and in-depth tutorial on how to setup the Ubuntu Perfect Home Server. Now that I've got 4 machines on my home network, I have a need for several different network services for my home.

So far, the requirements I have defined are:

* X11Forwarding
* OpenSSH server
* Bind/DNS
* Torrentflux
* Streaming video
* Streaming music
* ActiveDirectory services
* moblock or other firewall
* php
* mysql
* subversion
* samba
* automated backup 
* proxy
* clamav
* rsync
* koolab or alternatively webcal

Please feel free to add more.
