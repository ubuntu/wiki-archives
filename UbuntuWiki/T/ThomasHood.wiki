By day I am a researcher in artificial intelligence.

By night I was a user of and contributor to Debian between 2000 and 2005 inclusive.  I am or used to be maintainer or co-maintainer of a number of Debian packages but I never became an official DD.  I wrote most of <nowiki>[[http://qref.sourceforge.net/Debian/reference/ch-gateway.en.html|the networking chapter of the Debian Reference]]</nowiki> about one year prior to the release of sarge.  Looking at my e-mail archive and at the 700 or so archived bug reports under my name, I estimate that I have made contributions of one sort or another (mostly minor) to about sixty different Debian packages.  I drastically reduced my Debian activities in early 2006.  Since 2005 I have become increasingly interested in Ubuntu and I currently use Breezy on all my systems.  I think that Ubuntu is the natural successor to Debian.  I plan to spend more time becoming familiar with the project and looking for ways to help.  It's hard because Ubuntu is so well maintained already!
