__TOC__

== The idea ==
I'm a student at the Johns Hopkins University.  We can teach mini-courses during our three-week Intersession.  I believe I can benefit my peers by teaching a "Getting Started with GNU/Linux" course.
== What to call the course? ==
* Ideas here.
== Course: Week 1 ==
Getting started with a useful desktop OS.
=== "Relax: Linux is friendly, too" ===
* First day, just run programs off the Live CD.
=== "Get your very own" ===
* Then install.  Should be fairly easy for everyone, since I'll be walking around helping.
=== "Where are my data?" ===
* Teach partitions ("no c:, /dev/hda1 instead")
* "What is mounting?"
=== Why can't I play DVDs or MP3s? ===
* Find some formal answer
* Then show 'em the box to uncheck in Synaptic
=== Course: Week 2 ===

(-: Someone else can edit this more, please :-)
