=== About Me ===
A laid-back Texas/Nebraskan-originated learning enthusiast, I became interested in computers at a young age with a passion for Game Development. After switching to Ubuntu, I have found that I can do more than make games and am actively becoming involved with Open Source projects.

=== Testimonials ===

Tony's enthusiasm for designing new and innovative systems is impressive. Most people ask when a new feature will make it's way into the ecosystem. Most people ask themselves. Tony asks where he can find contributers to help. His work with the "Whubedocs" ( That's still just a beta name! ) project is outstanding, and really shows drive. I can endorse his work ethic 100%. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:paultag]]</nowiki>
