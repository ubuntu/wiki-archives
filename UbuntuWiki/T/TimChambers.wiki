=== About Me ===
I was fresh out of college when Richard Stallman wrote the GNU Manifesto.  I read it and knew I wanted to be a part of the Free Software Movement. I maintained casual connections to the community, mostly through involvement with Emacs. My involvement turned into a job for HP in 2003 testing Red Hat and SUSE on HP Integrity (Itanium) servers.

I created my Launchpad account in late 2006.

I've been a program manager at HP since 2005 but am now working to deepen my involvement with this project again.

=== Interests ===
* I'm an Evernote user. http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application&iId=2566
