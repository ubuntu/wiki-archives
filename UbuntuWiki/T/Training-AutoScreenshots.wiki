== Automatic Screenshots ==

The Ubuntu Desktop Course contains a vast number of screenshots. Different ways to take them automatically are researched and evaluated here.

=== Dogtail ===

# Install python-dogtail
# Run Applications->Programming->Dogtail Script Recorder

=== Test Run 1 ===

In lesson 2 'Exploring the Ubuntu Desktop' a series of screenshots is shown, starting from an empty desktop, covering the top panel menus and the add to panel dialog.

# Start Dogtail Script Recorder
# Record
# Open Applications->Accessories->Take Screenshot
# Make screenshots
# Repeat last two steps until all screenshots have been taken

Note: The print screen hotkey does not work when menus on a panel are open, hence the application was opened and not the hotkey used. 

=== Result ===

The recorded script only took half the number of screenshots than the actual run, see <nowiki>[[attachment:dogtail-screenshots.tbz2]]</nowiki> for the script and the different screenshots taken.

=== Evaluation ===

The script doesn't work as expected. Maybe manual editing of the script will give a better result.
