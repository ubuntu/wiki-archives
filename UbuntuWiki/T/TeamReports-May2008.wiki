 And, of course, with a special birthday version of Freevial (https://launchpad.net/freevial), a trivial-like game that looks somewhat like on a TV show.
* We have created a sub-group of the CatalanTeam only for the young ones (<30 years old), with the idea to focus on approaching other young people to the FOSS world and to create a space where they can speak about those things they have interest in, without having the entire community "listening".
