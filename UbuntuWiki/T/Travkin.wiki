=== About Me ===

I'm a 16 year old, living in the Latvia. By day, I am supporting mostly Linux/Windows machines and contributor in local region. By night, I am a certified geek, dragging into my obsession of computers and technology. But I do on occasion enjoy camping and outdoors with my friends. Even us geeks have to take a break now and then!

I have been using Linux (Ubuntu, Mepis, Gentoo and my favorite Arch Linux) for about 3 years now, but only in the past month have I become obsessed with it.

I'm Windows-Free since 3rd October 2005. 
Just take in those rules and never ever think twice.
