== Ubuntu Touch - Porting Guide ==

<nowiki>[[File:tablet_pictogram.png||align="left"]]</nowiki> We want to port Ubuntu Touch to all kinds of devices. If you have experience in porting code to Android devices or are generally knowledgeable in terms of porting, working with the Kernel and other core bits and pieces of a distribution, this might be interesting to you.

Check out the list of <nowiki>[[..-Devices|devices]]</nowiki> to see what's currently being worked on.

=== Disclaimer ===

=== TODO ===

* TODO items

=== General ===

To rapidly support a wide range of devices, our architecture reuses some of the drivers and hardware enablement available for Android.

As a consequence, at the current images you'll find some of the Android services running at the device, separated in a lxc container, providing all the basic services needed for Ubuntu to run fully accelerated (media, graphics, modem, etc).

For quick reference, these are the current components used from Android:
* Linux Kernel (stock Android kernel provided by the vendor, with a few changes to support some extra features needed by Ubuntu, such as Apparmor)
* OpenGL ES2.0 HAL and drivers
* Media (stagefright) HAL, to re-use the hardware video decoders
* RILD for modem support
* Android Camera HAL and Camera service

As Ubuntu is running as the main host on top of an Android kernel and the communication between the Android services and HAL happens via Binder, Sockets and libhybris.

Other than the very basic services (needed to re-use the binary blobs already available), the rest is just pure Ubuntu goodness :-) (we don't have dalvik running, for example).

=== Building the Ubuntu packages ===

We expect the Ubuntu Touch packages won't need changes for new devices; the usual processes for contributing to Ubuntu apply, such as the SponsorshipProcess.

Either way, you'll need the Ubuntu preinstalled image besides the one you're going to build with the instructions below. You can find the Ubuntu preinstalled images <nowiki>[[http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-touch/daily-preinstalled/|here]]</nowiki>.

=== Building the Android pieces (CM11-based devices) ===

At the moment we don't yet have any tree compatible with CyanogenMod 11.0, so porting using a CM based image is not yet supported (it's possible, but it would require quite a bit of work to reduce the build as we did for our AOSP based tree).

=== Building the Android pieces (AOSP-based devices) ===

You can find all the needed Android specific git repositories at https://code-review.phablet.ubuntu.com. This is a working gerrit server with everything needed to build the Android images used by Ubuntu Touch. The reference tree in there is based on AOSP (4.4.2 specifically), so make sure your device specific repositories are compatible with AOSP at least.

For any Android related project at our git server, you'll find a branch named ''phablet-4.4.2_r1''. This branch contains a static known git HEAD and the required changes needed for Ubuntu, including <nowiki>[[https://code-review.phablet.ubuntu.com/gitweb?p=aosp%2Fplatform%2Fmanifest.git;a=shortlog;h=refs%2Fheads%2Fphablet-4.4.2_r1|our custom Android manifest]]</nowiki>.

==== Set up your development environment ====

Everything we take from Android is just C/C++, so you'll notice that your Android build environment will be way smaller than when comparing to the traditional Android builds (and faster to build as well).

You can set up your development environment by <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Touch/Building#Set_up_your_development_environment|Touch/Building]]</nowiki>

==== Enabling a new device ====

If you're repository is compatible with the AOSP tree, it's just a matter of adding the device specific git repositories and the vendor files (usually blobs that you need to extract from the original android image). Once that is done, you should be able build a small android system image that can be used by Ubuntu Touch in order to make it fully compatible with the device.

===== Device =====

Add your device specific git repositories under ''phablet/device'' (phablet here is the repository you cloned by following <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Touch/Building#Set_up_your_development_environment|Touch/Building]]</nowiki>).

Make sure it's respecting the format used by AOSP (device/<vendor>/<device name>). As an example:
<pre>
phablet$ ls device/lge/mako
Android.mk                              apq8064-tabla-snd-card_Button_Jack.kl  BoardConfig.mk  conn_init       fstab.mako     init.mako.bt.sh   keypad_8064.kl      overlay                      recovery                thermald-mako.conf     vendorsetup.sh
AndroidProducts.mk                      audio_effects.conf                     board-info.txt  device.mk       full_mako.mk   init.mako.rc      media_codecs.xml    p2p_supplicant_overlay.conf  releasetools.py         touch_dev.idc          WCNSS_cfg.dat

apns-full-conf.xml                      bdAddrLoader                           charger_touch   egl.cfg         hs_detect.kcm  init_wlan.sh      mixer_paths.xml     pmic8xxx_pwrkey.kl           sepolicy                unblock_wakelock.sh    WCNSS_qcom_wlan_nv.bin
apq8064-tabla-snd-card_Button_Jack.kcm  bluetooth                              CleanSpec.mk    factory-images  hs_detect.kl   keypad_8064.kcm   nfc                 proprietary-blobs.txt        snd_soc_msm_2x_Fusion3  vendor_owner_info.txt  wpa_supplicant_overlay.conf
</pre>

===== Hardware =====

Add your hardware specifig git repositories under ''phablet/hardware''.

Make sure it's respecting the format used by AOSP (hardware/<vendor>/<component>). As an example:
<pre>
phablet$ ls hardware/qcom/audio/
Android.mk  hal  legacy  visualizer  voice_processing
</pre>

===== Vendor =====

Add your vendor specific binary blobs under ''phablet/vendor''.

Make sure it's respecting the format used by AOSP (hardware/<vendor>/<component>). As an example:
<pre>
phablet$ ls vendor/asus/flo/
BoardConfigPartial.mk  BoardConfigVendor.mk  device-partial.mk  device-vendor.mk  proprietary
phablet$ ls hardware/qcom/audio/
</pre>

====== Retrieving the proprietary blobs from Android ======

Ubuntu Touch Preview uses some pre-compiled binary drivers from the Android layer for rapid enablement of devices. These are referred to as binary or proprietary blobs, as their source code is not available for the build, and are included in binary form.

Since we use AOSP as a base, for supported devices all you need to do is to download and extract and run as mentioned in the downloads from https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/drivers

If porting for a device not available on AOSP and basing out of CyanogenMod, you can take advantage of it's `./extract-files.sh` script.

{*} '''Tip''': you can alternatively extract these binaries from the image (which is essentially a `.zip` file containing, amongst others, these binary files), but flashing it first helps as you can see if CM is working properly in the device.

To download Cyanogen``Mod 11 go to http://get.cm/.

Once you have your Cyanogen``Mod 11 based rom running at your device, run the following command to extract all the needed data:
<pre>
$ cd device/[manufacturer]/[codename]
$ ./extract-files.sh</pre>

This command should copy the needed files to `vendor/[manufacturer]/[codename]`.

===== Kernel =====

* Explain how to build the kernel out of the AOSP tree
* How to apply the kernel patches
* How to cross compile on Ubuntu

==== Device changes ====

===== Audio =====

* Might not be needed anymore, as we're using the Audio HAL
* Show how to validate that the audio stack is functional

===== Kernel =====

As a requirement from the Ubuntu userspace, we need to add a few extra kernel configs that are usually not enabled by default for Android.

====== Config ======

You can find your kernel config at <code>kernel/[manufacturer]/[codename]/arch/arm/configs/ cyanogenmod_[codename]_defconfig</code>. Please double check that it is indeed the default config file name in <code>device/[manufacturer]/[codename]/*.mk</code> (look for the TARGET_KERNEL_CONFIG variable).

You can run this tool to check if your config is up to date:

 https://github.com/janimo/check_ubuntu_touch_kernel_config

Extra configs that need to be added '''AT THE END OF THE CONFIG FILE SO THEY DO NOT GET OVERRIDEN'''

 <pre>
CONFIG_SYSVIPC=y
CONFIG_NAMESPACES=y
CONFIG_UTS_NS=y
CONFIG_IPC_NS=y
CONFIG_USER_NS=y
CONFIG_PID_NS=y
CONFIG_NET_NS=y
CONFIG_DEVTMPFS=y
CONFIG_DEVTMPFS_MOUNT=y
CONFIG_DEVPTS_MULTIPLE_INSTANCES=y
CONFIG_FSNOTIFY=y
CONFIG_DNOTIFY=y
CONFIG_INOTIFY_USER=y
CONFIG_FANOTIFY=y
CONFIG_FANOTIFY_ACCESS_PERMISSIONS=y
CONFIG_SWAP=y
CONFIG_VT=y
CONFIG_VT_CONSOLE=y
</pre>

Reasons:
* `*_NS` to enable support for containers
* `SWAP` because we're still using a swap file by default
* Without `paranoid_network` disabled, the browser won't work correctly

For debugging while hardware bringup you may also want to enable

CONFIG_PANIC_TIMEOUT=5
CONFIG_ANDROID_RAM_CONSOLE=y

The Ubuntu boot image and initramfs may not work at first so these two help read /proc/last_kmsg in case of a boot loop due to a kernel panic from the recovery image - which should work already, being more or less standard Android based.

====== Patches ======

The patch that was needed when Ubuntu was running inside container is no longer needed in the flipped model where Android is in an LXC container.

TODO: Describe the additional kernel patches missing here.

====== AppArmor ======

AppArmor is an integral part of Ubuntu Touch and is required to use click packages. Currently you are able to use Ubuntu Touch without enabling !AppArmor, but you will not be able to use click packages and the port will not be complete without backporting the !AppArmor v3 patchset to older kernels. !AppArmor has been backported to the following kernels in the Ubuntu archive already:
* <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-maguro|linux-maguro (3.0.0)]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-grouper|linux-grouper (3.1.10)]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-mako|linux-mako (3.4.0)]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-manta|linux-manta (3.4.0)]]</nowiki>

Documentation on how to backport the AppArmor v3 patchset to older kernels can be found <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/AppArmorForPhabletKernels|here]]</nowiki>.

Once the AppArmor patchset is working, you will likely need to add hardware-specific AppArmor rules for your device. You'll know this is the case if when running an application it shows an AppArmor denial in /var/log/syslog (`tail -f /var/log/syslog | grep DENIED` is very handy when troubleshooting policy). To make this easier, packages can drop AppArmor snippets into /usr/share/apparmor/hardware/. An entry for graphics hardware will almost certainly be required for click packages to work on the device. As of Ubuntu 13.10, policy consults the following directories:
* '''/usr/share/apparmor/hardware/graphics.d''': specific graphics hardware access. Used by the templates
* '''/usr/share/apparmor/hardware/audio.d''': specific audio hardware access. Used by the audio policy group (due to the use of pulseaudio, this may not be needed for your device)

Though any package can ship the policy, it makes sense for `lxc-android-config` to ship it since it also ships the udev rules. For example, if porting the HTC Desire Z (vision), you might ship the following:<pre>
$ cat /usr/share/apparmor/hardware/graphics.d/htc-desire-z-vision
## HTC Desire Z (vision)
  /dev/kgsl-2d0 rw,
  /dev/genlock rw,
  /sys/devices/system/soc/soc0/id r,
</pre>

Typically you specify the path to the device followed by 'r' for read access or 'rw' for read and write access. Simple globs and AARE (AppArmor regular expressions) are also possible. See `man apparmor.d` for details. When developing your policy, be sure to run `sudo aa-clickhook -f` before running your app to regenerate the policy. Please see <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingApparmor#Fixing_profile_bugs|DebuggingApparmor]]</nowiki> for more information on how to debug AppArmor policy.

You can test that !AppArmor is functioning correctly by:
* viewing the output of the `aa-status` command
* manually installing a click app doesn't show any !AppArmor errors (`sudo click install --force-missing-framework --user=$USER ./foo.click`)
* launching the manually installed click application works
* when running, the click application is confined as seen with `aa-status`. Eg (be sure there are two entries-- the first is that the profile is loaded and the second shows a particular pid is running under this profile):<pre>
$ sudo aa-status|grep hello-world
   ar.com.beuno.hello-world_hello-world_0.1
   ar.com.beuno.hello-world_hello-world_0.1 (24622)
</pre>
* install/launch hello-world from the Ubuntu appstore and launch it via 'Installed applications'. It should run and `aa-status` should show it is confined
* launch the twitter webapp via 'Installed applications' (preinstalled on the device, otherwise get from the Ubuntu appstore). It should run and `aa-status` should show it is confined

While porting, it might be useful to disable !AppArmor:
* system-wide: boot with apparmor=0
* click: adjust the desktop file for the click package in ~/.local/share/applications/<click>.desktop to not use `aa-exec` and/or adjust /usr/share/upstart/sessions/application-click.conf to not use 'apparmor switch'

'''IMPORTANT''': disabling !AppArmor for click packages in this manner means that you are disabling important security protections and allowing untrusted, unreviewed arbitrary code to run on your system. While this may be fine while developing the port, it is not enough to finish the port.

===== Screen definition =====

In order to provide a consistent layout across different screen sizes and resolutions we define a grid unit to be used by developers. This is set in:

/etc/ubuntu-touch-session.d/hammerhead.conf

For mako it is defined as:
<pre>
GRID_UNIT_PX=25
QTWEBKIT_DPR=2.5
</pre>
For example GRID_UNIT_PX should be 27 for 1080p to be 40GU-wide. More information may be found in the description of <nowiki>[[http://design.ubuntu.com/apps/get-started/screen-sizes | resolution independence]]</nowiki> on the design site.

==== Build changes ====

===== vendor/.. and device/... =====

Remove all unneeded android packages like FMApp.

===== main.mk =====

The main build file needs to be checked if updates are required to it to support new drivers or parts of the build not used before, it's path is: <code>build/core/main.mk</code>

The part of interest are the <code>subdirs</code> included in the build and if special treatment for devices need to be made, i.e.; make sure the new vendor subdirs are added.

This will eventually not be needed.

===== Brightness indicator =====

Due to the incorrect default permission at the sys brightness file, a change is needed to allow any user to change the display brightness. We need to `chmod` it to the proper permissions.

You can usually find the permission settings needed at the device init file, which is usually available under `device/[manufacturer]/[codename]/init.[codename].rc`.

The changes should look like the following:
 <pre> diff
device/samsung/p3100$ git diff
diff --git a/init.espresso.rc b/init.espresso.rc
index cae5772..4e7df71 100755
--- a/init.espresso.rc

 	chown system radio /sys/class/lcd/panel/lcd_type
 	chown system radio /sys/class/lcd/panel/lcd_power
 </pre>

=== The image ===

==== Building the image ====

Example for the mako target.
<pre>
. build/envsetup.sh
lunch aosp_mako-userdebug 
make -j8 # Or any other amount of threads
</pre>

Sourcing the envsetup.sh file adds lunch and other functions useful when working with the Android source tree and building from scratch. See http://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/w/Envsetup_help

Calling lunch with no arguments will present a list of valid target names and you can pick one.

At the end of the build process a couple of img files will be generated in `out/target/product/<codename>`, you can use rootstock to easy push your device, described bellow assuming trusty

<pre>
bzr branch lp:project-rootstock-ng [rootsock_trunk_path]
ROOTFS="utopic-preinstalled-touch-armhf.tar.gz"
wget -c "http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-touch/daily-preinstalled/current/$ROOTFS" -O "$OUT/$ROOTFS"
$ROOTSTOCK_DIR/rootstock-touch-install "$OUT/$ROOTFS" "$OUT/system.img"
</pre>

==== Debugging ====

===== Initrd =====

If you encounter initrd issues while booting you can add to your kernel boot arguments the following line "break=top" or replace "top" with another of the stages below.
<pre> 
 top
modules
premount
mount
mountroot
bottom
</pre>
This will open a adb shell and pause execution of the initrd so you can look around. 
Unlike break normal behavior on dekstop you cannot resume execution by exiting the adb shell.

Also you can add the <code> debug </code> word to the kernel boot argument this will save a log in /run/ with the progress of the initrd booting.

==== Working in the environment ====

===== Networking =====

The simplest solution given that you have a UI available is to use the networking indicator on the device.  The network indicator currently supports basic Wi-Fi connections only ( eg. No security, WEP, WPA Personal ).

An alternate means of configuring networking is via the '''phablet-network-setup''' tool which is part of the phablet-tools package.  This script can be used to copy an active Network Manager system settings file from an Ubuntu Desktop ( >= 12.04 LTS ) to the device.  It also has some extra options which cause the tool to install network-related packages such as iw and openssh-server.

If you have difficulty enabling the wifi drivers on your platform, you can still get network on your phone with reverse USB tethering over adb. See <nowiki>[[..-AdbNetworking | AdbNetworking]]</nowiki> for details.

===== Copying files to the phone =====

Prerequisites:

This is required if you are not working from the Android source tree, as `fastboot` and `adb` should be built as part of system build for the host part, they should be in your path and located here:

<pre>
out/host/linux-x86/bin/
</pre>

If not installing a personal build and not using trusty, make sure you have `ppa:phablet-team` added, if not

<pre>
add-apt-repository ppa:phablet-team/tools
</pre>

Then make sure to install `adb` and `fastboot`. You can do so by installing the following packages:

<pre>
apt-get install android-tools-adb android-tools-fastboot
</pre>

To get packages to your phone's chroot execute the following from your desktop:

<pre>
adb root
adb push [filename|directory name] [ubuntu path]
</pre>

Then to access these files on the phone follow the shell section below

===== Screen Pixel Ratio =====

We have 2 important variables that define the pixel ratio behaviour of the system and the applications, ie. how they visually scale. Look at `/usr/bin/ubuntu-session` for `GRID_UNIT_PX` and `QTWEBKIT_DPR`.

When adding the correct pixel ratio for a new port, first use the method below to calculate the desired `DPR`, and create a device specific config file which ubuntu-session can load at run time.

The number of pixels per grid unit (`GRID_UNIT_PX`) is specific to each device. Its goal is to make the user interface of the system and the applications of the '''same perceived size''' regardless of the device they are displayed on.
It is primarily dependent on the pixel density of the device’s screen and the distance to the screen the user is at. That second value cannot be automatically detected and is based on heuristics. We assume that tablets and laptops are the same distance and that they are held at 1.235 times the distance phones tend to be held at.

A reference device has been chosen from which we derive the pixels per grid unit for all other devices. The reference device is a laptop with a 120 ppi screen and the pixels per grid unit is set to 8 px/gu.

There is no way for the system to dynamically identify the correct pixel ratio for the device, which as a side effect things might be bigger/smaller than expected. For each device you will have to visually verify the quality of the result and adjust the number if necessary. If unsure, send screenshots and screen specifications of the device to the Canonical design team.

To create your device specific configuration, first identify the '''ro.product.device''' android property used by your device (check the ''/system/build.prop'' file from your port or from the original Android image). Then with the desired DPR, create a file at ''/etc/ubuntu-session.d'' adding your custom GRID_UNIT_PX and QTWEBKIT_DPR variables, also specifying the default form factor you want, such as:
<pre>
$ cat /etc/ubuntu-session.d/manta.conf
GRID_UNIT_PX=20
QTWEBKIT_DPR=2.5
FORM_FACTOR="tablet"
</pre>

===== Shell =====

* Describe adb shell and phablet-shell

====== SSH ======

To enable ssh run
<pre>
adb shell start ssh
</pre>

To make it start on every boot, run

<pre>
adb shell setprop persist.service.ssh true
adb reboot
</pre>

You can use adb port forwarding to easily connect to the container via SSH over USB.  To do so, run the following commands:
<pre>
adb forward tcp:8888 tcp:22
ssh phablet@localhost -p 8888</pre>

=== Ubuntu pieces ===

The Ubuntu container is put together using Ubuntu packages, which either come from the official Ubuntu archive or a personal package archive (PPA). The <nowiki>[[http://packaging.ubuntu.com/|Ubuntu Development guide]]</nowiki> will tell you more about modifying source packages and submitting them to Ubuntu for inclusion.

If you follow the following articles you should have a better idea of how to fix bugs in Ubuntu and which tools to use:
* <nowiki>[[http://packaging.ubuntu.com/html/introduction-to-ubuntu-development.html|Introduction to Ubuntu development]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[http://packaging.ubuntu.com/html/getting-set-up.html|Getting Set Up]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[http://packaging.ubuntu.com/html/fixing-a-bug.html|Fixing a bug in Ubuntu]]</nowiki>

Images are currently built in the Canonical data center and they are based on `saucy`.

When setting up `pbuilder` in "Getting Set Up", you might want to use something like this: <pre>
pbuilder-dist saucy armhf create</pre>
to set up a builder on a foreign (non-armhf) architecture. To build a source package, you would then use something along the lines of: <pre>
pbuilder-dist saucy armhf build happyhello_0.1.dsc</pre>

This creates a native build chroot using `qemu-arm-static`; some programs may fail in this environment.  It is also possible to cross-build some packages, which is still somewhat experimental but can be used at least for many core packages; see CrossBuilding for details.

The article to <nowiki>[[http://packaging.ubuntu.com/html/fixing-a-bug.html|fix a bug in Ubuntu]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[http://packaging.ubuntu.com/html/fixing-a-bug-example.html|the tutorial]]</nowiki> also cover how to get a fix sponsored into Ubuntu.

=== Contributing back ===

Images can be published on `cdimages.ubuntu.com`, if they can be built reliably and automatically and all the bits and pieces are redistributable. The images are currently built from an internal Jenkins instance and are manually copied to cdimages.ubuntu.com. In the next few days, we'll be working on moving away from this internal instance and fully automate the build process.

If you have any questions about the images or would like to get images added, <nowiki>[[..-Contribute#Discuss|ask us on the mailing list]]</nowiki>.

==== patches ====

Anything you patch needs to be signed off and have a patch created for which needs to be submitted to ubuntu-phone@lists.launchpad.net

If it’s directly related to the supported devices it will be accepted after review. Patches are accepted for all components. If a device is enabled it does not mean it will be part of the nightlies.

Patches will be reviewed by Sergio Schvezov and Ricardo Salveti (rsalveti) until the gerrit instance is in place.

Let us know as well in case you'd like a git repository that is part of CM to be available at phablet.ubuntu.com. Currently we just added the minimal needed for the Nexus family, but that might change depending on the device used.

==== Merge requests ====

At any point time if you find a bug and have a fix don’t hesitate to create an MR against the specific branch.

The project list lives under the phablet umbrella, looking at the list there you can find your project and review the code and or provide fixes at your discretion

----------

==== Troubleshooting (janimo) ====

* The device is in a bootloop or hangs on boot not showing up with adb shell: boot into recovery mode and adb pull /proc/last_kmsg to check the previous dmesg. Do not power off the device between the hang and booting into recovery as that likely leads to losing the ramconsole contents . Make sure you have proper permissions in the ramdisk and /init can start. Make sure you have a valid console=... argument on the kernel command line.

* The device boots but no graphics shell shows up: Debug via adb shell. You can look in /var/log/syslog for general system logs in ubuntu, /home/phablet/.cache/upstart/ for user session logs and run /system/bin/logcat -d to dump the Android logs. Reasons for unity not starting: 

** sensormanager has not started in Android (many Waiting for sensormanager... messages in logcat). Start it manually by running android-chroot and inside that Android shell run sensormanager. This is the symptom of an elusive bug that needs fixing.

** EGL errors in the logs, likely the permissions on the GPU related device nodes are not allowing regular user access (see below for udev rules setup)

==== w-flo's Notes ====

These are random notes that I have sent to the <nowiki>[[https://lists.launchpad.net/ubuntu-phone/msg03398.html|mailing list]]</nowiki> about my experiences with porting flipped Ubuntu Touch to the Desire Z. Someone who is better at writing could probably incorporate them into the guide at the correct place. They might be useful while the porting guide is being updated.

* There are apparently two different approaches for mounting the flipped images, and it seems like my port uses the old-style approach.
* The android_build repository on phablet.ubuntu.com has all the required changes to create the android zip file. It downloads files for a generic initramfs and puts them in "out/target/product/devicename/ubuntu-root". I think that changes to those files are not automatically put back into the ramdisk. (I've added an additional step to repack the ramdisk after changing the ubuntu-root/ dir contents.) That ramdisk is then used to create boot.img instead of the cyanogenmod ramdisk (which is used for android-boot.img).
* The "scripts/touch" file in the ramdisk needs to figure out the data partititon's device file name (like /dev/foo). It might fail for your device and cause the boot process to fail. I've hard-coded the device path for the Desire Z for now, maybe we can set this in the device config at build time later.
* If the initramfs script has problems finding the data partition, then /usr/lib/lxc-android-config/update-fstab could have problems too.
* /etc/init/lxc-android-boot.conf might be interesting as well.
* The Ubuntu rootfs needs a udev rules file for your device. Check the /usr/lib/lxc-android-config/70-*.rules  files as an example. You can create that file by looking at the ueventd*.rc files for your device from canogenmod and transforming the /dev/ settings to udev syntax.
You can create that file by invoking the following command while Ubuntu Touch is booted
<pre>
adb shell cat /var/lib/lxc/android/rootfs/ueventd*.rc|grep ^/dev|sed -e 's/^\/dev\///'|awk '{printf "ACTION==\"add\", KERNEL==\"%s\", OWNER=\"%s\", GROUP=\"%s\", MODE=\"%s\"\n",$1,$3,$4,$2}' | sed -e 's/\r//'
</pre>

Not all device node permissions may be covered by this. In particular if you have no graphics coming up and get EGL related errors in logcat, make sure you add a line allowing non-root rw access to the GPU device node.
For OMAP/SGX devices the line is something like
<pre>
ACTION=="add", KERNEL=="pvrsrvkm", OWNER="root", GROUP="root", MODE="0666"
</pre>
 
* There are some requirements for the kernel config. For example, I had boot failures before I enabled  CONFIG_VT=y and CONFIG_VT_CONSOLE=y.

* It's a good idea to check output of dmesg and /system/bin/logcat, and the contents of various log files in /var/log/upstart if there are problems.
