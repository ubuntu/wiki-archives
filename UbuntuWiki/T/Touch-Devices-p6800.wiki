== Known issues ==

* Kernel is based to the CyanogenMod/android_kernel_samsung_smdk4210, but it is a mess. So forked it, took code here and there (mostly from locerra's JB build).
* Kernel is based 3.0.15 and no newer one available (yet).
* Most of the drivers in kernel had to be turned off, because build was not succeeding...
* bluetooth: Doesn't work
* audio: Dock audio doesn't work.
* hwcomposer: HDMI dongle doesn't work.
* wifi: Doesn't work.
* camera: Doesn't work.
* .. and lot of kernel level bugs for sure.
* Displaydrivers are not working (yet).

=== How to build it ===
Clone the ubuntu sources by following the first steps of the porting guide.

Add these two repositories to your .repo/manifest.xml with cm-10.1 branch/heads.
* https://github.com/dun1982/android_device_samsung_p6800
* https://github.com/dun1982/android_kernel_samsung_p6800
* Then run "<repository root>/repo sync"
* Then run "<repository root>/. build/envsetup.sh"
* Then run "<repository root>/brunch p6800"

Your new build will be in the out directory.
