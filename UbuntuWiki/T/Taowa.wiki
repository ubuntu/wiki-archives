=== About Me ===
I am an english/french bilingual ubuntu user from Quebec. I like security, biking, radio and computing.

I am helping to triage ubuntu bugs and I am subscribed to multiple mailing lists. I am learning python, run ubuntu server to host files and know a bit of bash syntax (enough to get around).

I am very interested in cryptography notably asymmetric encryption.

=== Contributions ===

I have triages a few bugs and plan to triage 5 bugs a week (and slowly increase from there).

=== Future Goals ===

I'd eventually like to contribute code (but am not "fluent" in enough languages).
