__TOC__

I'll call the two clients "UOne" and "and471". The idea is to merge and471's UI into the UOne infrastructure. Steps to do the merge:

=== Before feature freeze ===
* [nessita + and471] merge registration steps UI from UOne into and471
* [nessita + and471] port/merge the UI logic from UOne to and471
***** connect and471 to UOne backend
***** connect and471 to UOne network manager stuff
***** port over and471 to UOne frontend
***** make and471 parts in UOne use UOne coding standards/conventions

* [mvo] write dbus calls out to UOne api
* [all] profit!

=== After the feature freeze ===

* [nessita?] merge/port the tests for UI from UOne into and471
* [all] profit more!

==== and471's logindialog requirements ====

This details the external modules/objects that and471's logindialog currently uses. This way we can hook it up easily.

login-backend:
    signals:
        "login-successful"
        "login-failed"
            with a bool whether the server was contacted
        
    functions:
        login(email, password, remember_authentication)
        cancel_login()
        
    properties:
        NEW_ACCOUNT_URL * (replaced by registration dialog)
        FORGOT_PASSWORD_URL
        
networkmanagerstate:
    functions:
        get_state()
            returns True if connected, False if not
        kill()
            stops everything (the mainloop etc.)
            
    callbacks:
        connect to self.on_network_manager_state_changed, with a bool
        argument, whether connected or not
