== Introduction ==
Following UDS and meeting discussions, during the Karmic cycle we've started using the <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-translations|Ubuntu Translations]]</nowiki> project as a central place to report and manage translation bugs. This has the benefits of providing:

* A central location to have an overview and keep track of all Ubuntu/Kubuntu translation bugs
* A container for Ubuntu bugs which in the past had wrongly been filed against Launchpad Translations
* The possibility for those interested in contributing to fixing translation-related bugs to <nowiki>[[https://help.launchpad.net/Bugs/Subscriptions|subscribe to bug mail]]</nowiki> and get notified of new bugs

== Procedure ==
The recommended procedure for filing translation bugs related to Ubuntu is the following:

* '''CHECKLIST''': make sure that the bug falls roughly in one of the following example categories:
** A string from an application is not available for translation in Launchpad Translations
** An application from the Ubuntu main repository is not available for translation in Launchpad Translations
** A translation made in Launchpad Translations is not updated in the Ubuntu language packs
** A source package has the wrong (or an inconsistent) translation domain
** You find a duplicate template
** A template/translation is no longer used in Ubuntu and should be deleted from the distro page in Launchpad Translations
** Errors in spellcheckers or language support 
* '''FILING THE BUG''': <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ReportingBugs|file a bug]]</nowiki> against the corresponding package. If you don't know the package, you can skip to the next step and someone will try to assign it the right package.
* '''OPENING A BUG TASK''': open a bug task against the `ubuntu-translations` project by using the ''Also affects project'' link. Here's how you can open a bug task. <<BR>><<BR>>
 First of all, you'll have to choose the ''Also affects project'' link <<BR>>
 <nowiki>[[File:1-OpenTask.png|Opening the task|width=500]]</nowiki><<BR>><<BR>>
 Then you can choose the project you want to open the task against <<BR>><<BR>>
 <nowiki>[[File:2-ChooseProject.png|Choosing the project|width=500]]</nowiki><<BR>><<BR>>
 And finally you can assign the task to the `ubuntu-translations` project <<BR>><<BR>>
 <nowiki>[[File:3-AssignUT.png|Assigning to Ubuntu Translations|width=500]]</nowiki>
* '''ADDING A TAG''': if appropriate, add a tag to the bug. The most common ones are <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-translations/+bugs?field.tag=l10n|l10n]]</nowiki> for issues related to translated strings and <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-translations/+bugs?field.tag=i18n|i18n]]</nowiki> for issues related to internationalization infrastructure.
