Notes from porting a CMake using project.

* Open up main CMakeLists.txt in SDK, set to use Ubuntu kits
* Variables to possibly set in project config

** UBUNTU_PROJECT_TYPE "ClickApp" CACHE INTERNAL "Let Qtc know were a click app"
** UBUNTU_MANIFEST_PATH "./click/manifest.json" CACHE INTERNAL "Tells QtCreator location and name of the manifest file"
