** put a CD, DVD or ZIP disk in your computer, and see if it auto-mounts. 
** if you have an Audio CD at hand insert it, it should open in the installed player. 
1. 'grep -r' for your password in /var/log/installer/ and /var/cache/debconf/; make sure it does not appear. Using the following in a terminal, replace password with your actual password(read the warning below):
   grep -r 'password' /var/log/installer/ /var/cache/debconf/
** This is to ensure that <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/bugs/34606|bug #34606]]</nowiki> does not recur.
** '''Warning''': be careful on a live system since this command will land in your bash history.  Look for HISTSIZE in bash(1) or run  help history;  history -c clears history before it makes it to disk (except possibly swap space).
** While you have a terminal open, go to '''Help -> Help Contents''' and make sure it opens.
1. Log out, shutdown/restart
** Confirm proper graphical progress display and restart/shutdown functionality.
