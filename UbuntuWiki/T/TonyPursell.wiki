=== About Me ===

I'm married and live in <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontypool|Pontypool]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Wales|South Wales]]</nowiki> , in the <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK|UK]]</nowiki>. I retired a few years ago after five years as a Civil Servant, but before that I spent 35 years working in IT development (design, specification, documentation, installation, support and a bit of programming).  A lot of that was with various flavours of Unix and different databases.  I now do voluntary work for my local <nowiki>[[http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/|Citizens Advice]]</nowiki> which takes up most of my spare time.

=== Me & Linux ===

My first experience with Linux was with Slackware (CLI only), back in 1996. I used the UMSDOS system and booted off a floppy disk. Very basic, but I could do some work at home on the scripts I couldn't get running at work.

In 2004, I struggled to get Debian installed and hated KDE, but then I found Ubuntu (Warty). I must have been one of the first to try it, and its been all plain sailing since. Ubuntu Linux has been my main desktop OS for a long time now. I also have Ubuntu on my EEEPC and an Acer Aspire REVO.

=== Things I do for Ubuntu ===

I'm really just a user of Ubuntu, but I do try and do what I can for the community.

* I am a LibreOffice user on Ubuntu (and Windows) so I answer LibreOffice questions on Launchpad. 
* I edited a few sections of '''Getting Started with Ubuntu''' produced by the <nowiki>[[http://ubuntu-manual.org/|Ubuntu Manual Project]]</nowiki>
* I have posted a few bugs.
* I have done a bit of translating (English-GB and Welsh).
