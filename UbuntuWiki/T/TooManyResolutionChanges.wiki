=== Summary ===

=== Rationale ===

=== Use cases ===

=== Scope ===

=== Design ===

=== Implementation ===

* If a graphical grub is used, the resolution change could be avoided by ensuring that grub is configured to use the same mode as usplash and not switching back to text mode before boot is started.   This would require a tool to force the display back to text mode if usplash cannot be started.
