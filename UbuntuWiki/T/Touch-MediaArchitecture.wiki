Blueprint: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/client-1303-hw-video-decode-rendering-support

=== Goals ===

* Audio and video playback
* Hardware accelerated
* Ubuntu Touch for now; Ubuntu Desktop in the future
* Leverage Android BSPs of supported Ubuntu Touch devices
* DRM support

=== Out of scope ===

* Media capture / encoding and transcoding
* Webcam
* Currently not directly targeting Ubuntu Desktop
* Currently not targeting !WiFi Direct
* !UPnP -- might be provided by apps though

=== Requirements ===

* Need to have a DRM solution for commercial products (OEM and media content industry requirement)
** DRM solution might impose extra requirements on e.g. access to buffers, multiple processes, security/confinement etc.
* Support at least the codecs supported in the Android phones we're targeting as supported Ubuntu Touch devices
* Concurrent playback of multiple streams (at least audio mixing)
* Bluetooth audio output (e.g. headset)
* Media indexing?

=== Android bits ===

On Android, media decoding is provided by a separate Media Service process which provides audio and video decoding.

=== Media indexing ===

=== Media control ===

=== Power management ===

=== DRM / security ===

=== Codecs ===

=== Import / export / share ===

Syncing over USB and Bluetooth
U1?

=== Dock / external screen ===

Applications don’t control which output they are on, but get notified of the new display properties.  This will also affect media playback.

=== Audio input + output selection / plug detection ===

Not covered by this spec, but see Ricardo Salveti’s spec on audio input + output selection and plug detection.

=== API ===

=== Architecture ===
