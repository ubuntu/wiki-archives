== Team Speak ==

TeamSpeak is the proprietary VoIP software being used at the BoF sessions for the Ubuntu Paris Summit.  Anyone can join in these sessions while the summit is on going.  We will also be using Gobby to write the specs.

server: teamspeak.uds.canonical.com

Use your real name for "nickname".

Make sure you use press to talk else you will get echo and use headphones not loudspeaker.

=== Comment ===
It is embarrassing that the Ubuntu developers are using this proprietary software. 

Nowdays the replacement to Teamspeak is ''mumble''. The package is available at the Universe repository.
