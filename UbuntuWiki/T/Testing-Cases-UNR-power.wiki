1. '''Confirm the following state is supported'''
  a. Verify the performance governor: set to performance governor and check the frequencies of all the CPUS. It should be the maximum supported freq.
  a. Verify the powersave governor: set to powersave governor and check the frequencies of all the CPUS. It should be the minimum supported freq.
  a. Verify the userspace governor: set to userspace governor and make sure, that it is set properly; set to all possible frequencies and check whether it is set properly.
  a. Verify that the on-demand governor obeys the scaling max and min frequencies: set to ondemand governor and make sure it is set properly; Take all CPUs to idle and make sure the frequencies goes to the minimum; Keep all CPUs busy and make sure freq goes to the maximum.

1. '''Confirm the following state is supported'''
  a. T-state performance: observe any performance differences through the /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/stats and /proc/acpi/processor/*/power during controlled workloads.
