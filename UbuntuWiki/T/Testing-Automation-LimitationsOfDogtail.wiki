__TOC__

==== Doesn't record everything ====
When you play back this means that you are not in the state anticipated by the storyboard. The rest of the script fails, often with a crash.

* '''Solutions:''' 
** fix the script up by hand to bridge the missing instructions, often using keystroke input.

==== Fragile to localisation ====
Scripts recorded with one language setting generally don't play back with other language settings

* '''Solutions:'''
** Standardise on a single localisation for recording and playback - reduces testing coverage
** Use role names instead of label text to triger actions - requires more manual coding and role names are often missing

==== Focus issues ====

It sometimes doesn't grab the focus of the applications. If you're using dogtail recorder this can lead to a loop of it.
