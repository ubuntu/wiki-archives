== Virtual Box 4.1 ==

This section is for the installing of VBox 4.1 which is needed if you use testdrive. Once the <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/testdrive/+bug/1098080 | bug]]</nowiki> is resolved, you can safely use the 4.2 version.

=== Install Virtual Box 4.1 ===

From the <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal | terminal]]</nowiki> issue:

<pre>
sudo apt-get install virtualbox
</pre>

You will be asked for your password, and then it will install.

Whilst that is all that is needed, you may well find it useful to install the <nowiki>[[http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/4.1.24/Oracle_VM_VirtualBox_Extension_Pack-4.1.24-82872.vbox-extpack | Extension Pack]]</nowiki>. Do please note the slight change in licence for this pack. It is free for personal use, but you should always ask people to download from that link so that they are aware of the licence. Information on using the Extension Pack can be found <nowiki>[[https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch01.html#intro-installing | here]]</nowiki>.
