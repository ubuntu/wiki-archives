__TOC__


This is a brief summary of bugs fixed between Ubuntu 14.04.5 and 14.04.6.  '''This summary covers only changes to packages in ''__main__'' and ''__restricted__'', which account for all packages in the officially-supported CD images; there are further changes to various packages in ''universe'' and ''multiverse''.'''  Some of these fixes were by Ubuntu developers directly, while others were by upstream developers and backported to Ubuntu.  For full details, see the individual package changelogs.

In addition to the bugs listed below, this update includes all security updates from the <nowiki>[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/releases/ubuntu-14.04-lts/|Ubuntu Security Notice list]]</nowiki> affecting Ubuntu 14.04 LTS that were released up to and including March 4, 2019.  The last update included was USN-3885-2 (OpenSSH vulnerability).

=== Installation bug fixes ===

Updated CD images are provided with this release, including fixes for some installation bugs.  (Many installation problems are hardware-specific; for those, see "Hardware support bugs" below.)

| lsb
| Bug:1582813
| 01-upstart-lsb: when diverting an init script to an upstart job, we can't directly map the 'status' subcommand to /sbin/status because the return value of the latter is always 0 if we communicated successfully with upstart.  Instead, parse the output of the command to correctly map this to the LSB return codes. .

| init-system-helpers
| Bug:1616422
| script/deb-systemd-invoke: Replace with /bin/true. systemd as pid 1 and for /lib/systemd/system/ is not supported in Ubuntu 14.04. It will only be supported as "deputy init" running as an upstart job and handling /lib/systemd/upstart/ (and /{run,etc}/systemd/system as usual). This completely disables the handling of systemd units shipped by Ubuntu packages, to avoid suddenly breaking them when installing them alongside the new deputy systemd init.
|-
| systemd
