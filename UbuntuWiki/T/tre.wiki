About Me:

New user of Ubuntu. I have tried several versions in the past but have never had the time to learn about what I was doing. have recently taken the plunge and am loving it, and just really want to spend some time getting to know it. I would consider myself to be reasonably competent but by no means an expert with computers.  I do some freelance work repairing hardware and software related problems with windows based systems.  I really like the idea of the bug squad as I think its the ideal opportunity to learn something of problems I may otherwise never encounter.
 
I have no specific area of interest, I'm just keen to learn my way around.
