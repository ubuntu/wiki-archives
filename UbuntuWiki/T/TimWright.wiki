=== About ===
I'm Tim Wright, a 21-year-old Computer Science student attending LSU.

=== Ubuntu ===
Ubuntu is my first Linux distribution, since October 2004 (with Warty), and I have become very experienced using it.  Currently, I am using Breezy on my laptop as my main OS.  I am a regular on the forums, and sometimes in #ubuntu.  My first major wiki contribution is <nowiki>[[LaptopTestingTeam/DellInspiron8200]]</nowiki>.
