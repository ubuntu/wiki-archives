I've been using Ubuntu since Warty and have been contributing since shortly after that.

=== Contributions ===

* Created Alacarte for Ubuntu and eventually got it included in GNOME as of 2.16
* #ubuntu op for ~18 months and member of ubuntu-ops team
* Been on the forums since Mar 2005 and have made over 1000 posts, most of them helping people in the "Ubuntu Development" subforums
* Created WillowNG for Edubuntu during the 2006 Google Summer of Code
* compiz development, bug triage, and end-user help

=== Looking Forward ===

 Basically my plans for future contribution to Ubuntu are just doing what I'm already doing.
