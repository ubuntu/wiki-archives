=== About me ===

I'm a computer science student from Germany.
My first distri I got was a Debian in 1999. The first Ubuntu was 7.04.
In late 2007 I decided to help the Ubuntu community by triaging some bugs and help out in #ubuntu-de on freenode.
I'm also a co-founder of the local computer club/hacker space in <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuss|Neuss]]</nowiki>.
