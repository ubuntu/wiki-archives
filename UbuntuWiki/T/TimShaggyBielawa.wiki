==== About Me ====
{{http://ducksarepeople.com/images/shagagachi.png}} Hi! I'm Tim Bielawa, most folks just call me shaggy, on the internets you'll probably see me as tbielawa. I'm 22 years old and a 4th year student at <nowiki>[[http://www.wvu.edu/|West Virginia University]]</nowiki>. I'm working towards getting my undergraduate degrees in both Computer Science and Mathematics which I plan on following up with a Masters in Computer Science. I'm planning to do my graduate research in the fields of simulations (CFD) and/or graphic rendering technologies.

I've been an 'avid' Linux user for about 6 years now. I've run a few distros since I got started, including... Slackware 10, 11, Gentoo 2006, Debian, and most recently Ubuntu 7.10 and 8.04. I have many fond memories of Slackware involving wget'ing a kernel, patching it for XFS support, and then building it :D *nostalga*

I work for the <nowiki>[[http://lcsee.wvu.edu|Computer Science Department]]</nowiki> at WVU where I'm a system administrator. I thought I was going to be a Slackware forever up until I got that job last September when I started getting my hands really dirty with Linux. We run the entire infrastructure on Ubuntu. Currently we have servers running the spectrum from Dapper Drake up to the recently deployed Hardy Heron machines. As you could have already guessed, being surrounded by Ubuntu to that level played a factor in me switching from Slackware.

==== Goals ====
    "Goal (n): ''the state of affairs that a plan is intended to achieve 
    and that (when achieved) terminates behavior intended to achieve it''"
Given that definition I don't have many goals. Most things I want to do will require the behavior that was required to reach the goal to be continued. That being said, I have some things I would like to do.
* Become an official MOTU
* Help the MOTU Science Team as much as possible
* Make packages better when I think I can
* Spread Free Software
* Research in simulation and graphic technologies
** Create the best free CFD application ever

== Activism ==

==== Free Software Advocacy Group ====
<nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~fsag|Free Software Advocacy Group]]</nowiki> - A club I started at my university. Our stated goal is to: "Raise Awareness, distribute, and encourage the adoption and installation of free software to the Student Body, <nowiki>[[http://www.morgantown.com/|Morgantown Community]]</nowiki>, and in Campus Computing Facilities."

==== Packaging 101 Session ====
