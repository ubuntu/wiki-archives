=== About Me ===

I have been using Ubuntu since version 6.10 and previously dabbled with Red Hat Linux and later Fedora.

My first home computer was an Apple //e (which I spent way too much money on).  However, I did teach myself C programming on the //e (I had a C, Pascal, and Assembly compiler for the //e).

I am an aerospace engineer (working mostly on the Space Shuttle program - GN&C - since 1979).
