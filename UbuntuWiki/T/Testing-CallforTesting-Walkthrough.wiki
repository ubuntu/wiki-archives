== Introduction ==
This page will walk through participating in a call for testing. It will demonstrate how to use the QAtracker and submit a result.

== Video Screencast of Tutorial ==
A video version of this tutorial <nowiki>[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLyCE5e0nxE|can be seen on youtube]]</nowiki>.

== Package Tracker ==
The <nowiki>[[http://packages.qa.ubuntu.com/|Package Tracker]]</nowiki> is a tool containing information about how to test, how to report a bug, and submit results. As part of the call for testing a specific link or product name has been provided that links to a testing milestone (or event). Clicking on the link to a page showing the packages to be tested, each with their own set of testcases.

=== Installing the package ===
<nowiki>[[File:instructionlinks.png]]</nowiki>

Notice the link to the page for installation instructions. These instructions will typically require installing a package from the repository or a ppa. Also notice that un-installation instructions are given, for removing the package after testing if desired.

=== Reporting a bug ===
<nowiki>[[File:instructionlinks.png]]</nowiki>

Additionally, there is a link to the bug reporting instructions. This page will detail how to report a bug and/or provide a link to help report bugs found properly. If a bug is found while testing, refer to that link for instructions on reporting. 

== Executing the testcase ==
Select a testcase and a page containing instructions to follow to execute the test will appear. Most of the testcases follow a simple format - perform an action, and then expect a result. A step in this <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/TestCaseFormat|format]]</nowiki> is shown below.

Alternatively the testcase may appear as the form of yes/no questions, where the expected result is a generally a yes.

For more information on the testcase formats, have a look at <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/TestCaseFormat|testcase formats page]]</nowiki>.

Go through each step of the testcase and follow the instructions. Perform the action, and ensure the expected result occurs. If something different occurs, note it as a bug, but continue the testcase.
