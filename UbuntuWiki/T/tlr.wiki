=== Contributions ===

I am in the process of upgrading my employers servers to Ubuntu. Several years ago I was hired to solve their business problems using Linux. I am now confident that Ubuntu Server is the right fit for us and am looking forward to using Ubuntu at work as well as at home. 

I frequently visit and help Ubuntu users in the Ubuntu answers section of the Launchpad site. 

I have joined the Bug Squad Team and am helping triage bugs, find duplicate bugs, assign proper packages to bugs and convert and answer support questions.

=== Future Goals ===

My goal is to become an Ubuntu developer and further contribute to the Ubuntu community. I am already part of the Bug Squad Team, my next goal is to join and help out the Ubuntu Reviewers Team.
