* '''Launchpad Entry''': UbuntuSpec:classmatepc-education-application-set
* '''Packages affected''': edubuntu-desktop-classmatepc

=== Summary ===

A specific Edubuntu desktop package will be required for the Intel ClassmatePC due to:

 1. limitations on the internal storage
** for default image install
** for add/remove applications
 2. limitations of screen size / functionality
 3. other hardware considerations
** e.g. application needs <LeftShift> and <RightShift> keys

=== Release Note ===

* New requirement.
* Device specific.
* Edubuntu for the ClassmatePC specific.
* No impact on existing users of any previous Ubuntu version.

=== Rationale ===

Due to the issues in the summary:

 1. Not all of standard edubuntu bundled applications will be included in the ClassmatePC delivery.

 2. Not all of standard edubuntu applications available for install through the g-a-i (Add/Remove menu options) will be apropriate for download and install onto the ClassmatePC.

=== Use Cases ===

=== Assumptions ===

=== Design ===

A testing process will be performed against:

# the applications in the standard edubuntu-desktop package
# selected applications from the main repository

* Application Testing Criteria
** identify hardware issues
** such as "missing keys" = non-standard keyboard
** test usability of applications with respect to screen size
** with screen pan
** with alt key window move
** record load time
** suggested max load time = 30-45 seconds
** note for each application
### time taken before user gets feedback
### time taken to load application
### open file (where applicable)
### save file (where applicable)
** categorise into
*** < 15 seconds
*** < 30 seconds
*** < 45 seconds
*** > 45 seconds

* General Testing Criteria
** RAM ... performance
** multi-load of applications
** runs standalone

* Prepare a shortlist for discussion with Intel
** class applications against the test info above:
** acceptable / not acceptable
** note any language issues
** final selection will be made against the test info above

=== Implementation ===

 1. A specific edubuntu-desktop-classmatepc will be created

** '''Oliver''' to please fill in detail here

 2. Add-Remove customisation for the edubuntu-desktop-classmatepc
** a local file is present on each machine containing the application list available for install
** the testing process will provide a list of acceptable / unacceptable applications
** a specific edubuntu-desktop-classmatepc application list will be prepared
** with assistance from Michael Vogt
** to overwrite the standard application list file
** the application list file can be update by a regular update
** an update file will overwrite the existing file

=== BoF agenda and discussion ===

Discussion points:

 1. Not all of standard edubuntu bundled applications will be included in the ClassmatePC delivery.

 1. Not all of standard edubuntu applications available for install through the g-a-i (Add/Remove menu options) will be apropriate for download and install onto the ClassmatePC.

* The considerations are:
** limitations on the internal storage
** for default image install
** for add/remove applications
** limitations of screen size / functionality
** other hardware considerations
** e.g. application needs <LeftShift> and <RightShift> keys

* Decisions need to be taken on:

  1. What are the criteria for determining an approved subset
** what install space size is reasonable to provide an acceptable user data space
** what other hardware limitations
** language considerations

  2. What is the testing procedure to select a sub-set of applications that are "approved"
** what is the testing process
** who will do the testing
** what is the approval process
** who will do the approval
** how is this list maintained
** who will do the maintaining
** patches / updates ... any issues around these ?

  3. What applications are included in the standard install bundle from the approved subset
** who selects the options
** what is the process
** who approves the options
** what is the process
** language considerations ?

  4. How is the Add/Remove issue going to be managed
** users should not download and install certain applications (i.e. applications that are not in the approved subset)
** how is this going to be managed
