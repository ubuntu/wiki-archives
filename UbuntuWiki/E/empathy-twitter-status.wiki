=== Installation ===
Read the README file, it should contain all the needed information.  You need tweepy to get it working.
=== Using Empathy-twitter-status ===
Before you can use the script you have to create a configuration file like instructed in the README file.  On the first start, the script will start your browser and will ask access to your twitter information.  After granting access, twitter will give you a pin code which you have to enter.  Once empathy-twitter-status received your pin code, it will return a key and a secret which has to be added to the configuration file.
