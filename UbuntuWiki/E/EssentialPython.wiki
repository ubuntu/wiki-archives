__TOC__

We would like to be able to write tools for certain low-level system tasks for Ubuntu in Python, such as:

* Package preconfiguration via debconf
* System initialization scripts
* Package pre-installation scripts

Such tasks can only be carried out using packages which are considered Essential by the packaging system.  Currently, Perl, bash and the traditional UNIX scripting languages are the only programming languages to have this status.  Considerations in making Python essential include:

* Python is a very large package, and may need to be split into essential and non-essential pieces
* Python's community does not like the idea of splitting the standard library
* The existing Python package has some non-essential dependencies

* TIP* distutils.core missing
An example of package split is that distutils is not included in the main package.
If you get an error while running setup.py, install python-dev
