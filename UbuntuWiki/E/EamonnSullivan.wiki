__TOC__

Father of five, user of Linux since 1993, currently residing in London. I'm a transplant from Boston, Massachusetts, (and before that New York), but have been in the U.K. since 1998, so I'm almost used to it now. I'm an editor on an international newswire, covering legal affairs and regulators in Europe. 

As a sideline, I write tiny snippets of what I hope is useful code, including <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/itunes-export/|a python module for exporting info out of iTunes]]</nowiki> and larger projects such as <nowiki>[[https://wiki.eamonnsullivan.co.uk/svn/bloomberg/trunk|a program to do historical calculations on securities.]]</nowiki>
