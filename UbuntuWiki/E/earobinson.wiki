== About Me ==
My name is Edward Robinson currently living in Ontario, Canada. I’m a computer science major at the University of Toronto and I have been using Linux since 2003 and Ubuntu since May 2005.

I would like to see Ubuntu grow, and more users being able to use Ubuntu problem free. To do this I feel that One of the most important things is to support new users, and the Ubuntu forums have played a very important role in this. I would like to continue to become a part of this growing community, and to grow with it.

== Activity ==
 1. Spreading the Ubuntu spirit. I do this by showing many people the distribution and open source programs in general. Also I give out the CD’s!
 2. I am very active on the Ubuntu forums (<nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntuforums.org/member.php?find=lastposter&t=103381|Team Leader]]</nowiki>) and provide support and focused mostly on providing support.
 3. I have been running dapper since its launch to aid with the testing.

== My plans and ideas for Ubuntu and Linux ==
* For now I would like to stay focused on providing support, and making it as easy as possible for people to run Ubuntu and Linux in general, because I feel that with a larger user base will help Ubuntu and Linux grow more than anything.
