__TOC__

== Introduction ==
Edgy, all about cutting edge, perhaps bleeding edge, will consist of brand new code and infrastructure. The time has come to introduce some seriously interesting, but definitely edgy, new technologies that lay the groundwork for the next wave of Ubuntu development.

Knot CD 3 is the third in a series of milestone CD images that will be released throughout the Edgy development cycle as images known to be reasonably free of CD-build or installer bugs. They represent very current snapshots of Edgy. Kubuntu Edgy Knot releases can be downloaded from the following URL:
* http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/releases/edgy/knot-3/

'''NOTE:''' ''This is an alpha (pre-) release. Pre-release versions of Edgy are '''__NOT__''' encouraged for anyone needing a stable system or not comfortable running into occasional, even frequent, breakage. Pre-release versions of Edgy '''__ARE__''' recommended for Ubuntu developers and those who want to help in testing, reporting, and fixing bugs.''

== New In Edgy Knot 3 ==
Edgy Eft has many new, bleeding edge applications and technologies that are designed to be the framework of future Kubuntu releases. With every new Knot release, there will be many new and exciting features. The following features will be present in the Kubuntu Edgy Eft Knot 3 release. Remember that all of these features are part of a pre-release version of Kubuntu, and may still have issues. We ask that any problems you come across, file a bug, if one has yet to be filed for your problem.<<BR>>

=== Upstart ===
'''Info:''' http://upstart.ubuntu.com <<BR>>

Upstart, an event-based replacement for the <code>/sbin/init</code> daemon, handles the starting of tasks and services during boot, stopping them during shutdown, and supervising them while the system is running. With the Ubuntu distribution currently at mind, it is also being developed to be suitable for deployment in all Linux distributions as a replacement for the <code>sysvinit</code> package.<<BR>>

'''Highlights'''
* Tasks and Services are started and stopped by events
* Events are generated as tasks and services are run and stopped
* Events may also be generated at timed intervals, or when files are changed
* Events may be received from any other process on the system
* Services may be respawned if they die unexpectedly
* Bi-directional communication with init daemon to discover which jobs are running, why jobs failed, etc.

=== New Artwork ===
Kenneth Wimer and the art team have been busy once again reworking the current artwork in Kubuntu Edgy. It seems that after further discussion, the Purple has taken a different tone, some more blue has been added back in, the KDM Login Splash screen has changed, and of course the wallpaper and color scheme has changed as well. We are interested in hearing what you think of this current design and layout, so please leave your comments and/or suggestions at the <nowiki>[[Artwork/Incoming/Kubuntu-Edgy-Ideas-Feedback|Artwork Feedback Page]]</nowiki>.

You now have the choice of hibernating your computer from the logout screen. Hibernation also works together with the Guidance Power Manager setup as well, insuring minimal power consumption, leading to overall power efficiency.

'''Info:''' <nowiki>[[attachment:gammadiff.png|Image displaying the difference between the current gamma layout and the old gamma layout]]</nowiki> <<BR>>

Gamma editing made simpler this time around! Instead of having to fumble with four seperate boxes, there is now only one, in turn making the configuration and color/gamma settings much easier to handle.

Decided upon at the Ubuntu Developer's Summit in Paris this year, Kubuntu received its own power management applet. The designing and work began right then and there by Sebastian Kügler, Jonathan Riddell, and others. Since the initial release there has been vast improvements. Layout, code, and icons have all come together to create on amazing applet for Kubuntu 6.10 (Edgy Eft).

Besides battery and CPU status reporting, there is the ability to switch to a lower power state and various actions can now be performed when the power cable is plugged/unplugged or even if the laptop screen lid is closed.

There are still some known issues and kinks to be worked out, and the team is working hard on fixing the current issues. If you have any comments and/or suggestions concerning the power manager applet, please visit the <nowiki>[[KubuntuPowerManagementFeedback|feedback page]]</nowiki>.<<BR>><<BR>>
