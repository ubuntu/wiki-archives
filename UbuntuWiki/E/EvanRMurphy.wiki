__TOC__

My personal wiki is currently under construction. Please try again later. You can also <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~evanrmurphy|visit me on Launchpad]]</nowiki>.

=== Scratch Pad ===

==== Development ====

* Wading through https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PackagingGuide/Complete. Have made substantial edits to PackagingGuide/*, MOTU/GettingStarted and had good discussion with dholbach, other MOTU along the way.
* Next is step 4 of https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MOTU/GettingStarted
* Other good links: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopment, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopers and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuArchitecture

===== Signpost =====

* Following some discussion on the ubuntu-devel-discuss ML, <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~andrew-bugs-launchpad-net|Andrew Sayers]]</nowiki> had the idea for the #ubuntu-signpost IRC channel to help direct new users to appropriate help tools
* We've since expanded the idea to include the https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Signpost wiki as well

==== Spanish Translations ====

* Continuing global replacement of "habilitar" with "activar" as the translation for "enable"
* Great link: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TranslationLifecycle

===== IRC =====

* #ubuntu-l10n-es chosen as IRC channel for UbuntuSpanishTranslators
* lecaros granted flags for #ubuntu-es-l10n
* Forward created from #ubuntu-es-l10n to #ubuntu-l10n-es
* Channel publicized on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuSpanishTranslators/, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InternetRelayChat#Channels and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuWeeklyNewsletter/Ideas
* Waiting on flags from P3L|!C4N0 for #ubuntu-l10n-es
* Helpful links: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/IrcTeam/CreatingChannels, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/IrcTeam/OperatorGuidelines, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InternetRelayChat#LogBots, http://freenode.net/using_the_network.shtml
* !LoCoBot (locobot_5) acquired for the channel, which is now logged at http://logs.ubuntu-eu.org/freenode/

==== Prospective Ubuntu Membership ====

* Expand and improve this wiki
* Acquire testimonials/sponsors
** Possibilities: DavidPlanella, DanielHolbach, !RicardoPerez
* Add name to https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/RegionalBoards/Americas
* Alternatively, persevere and acquire MOTU membership, which would automatically grant general Ubuntu Membership
