== About.me/GOTWIG ==
{{http://d13pix9kaak6wt.cloudfront.net/avatar/gotwig_1329653080_81.png|W00T|width=140}}
My name is Eduard Gotwig, I'm 17 years old, and live in Germany.

I am currently going to the b.i.b International College in Bergisch Gladbach, to study computer science.

I just finished my first semester and try to spend nearly all my free time (especially in my holidays) for developing Open Source Software.

In 2009-2011 I focused more on administration with Linux  based operating systems, and  experienced a lot with Slackware® and LFS.

I am trying to spend nearly all my free time (especially in my holidays) for developing and maintaining Open Source Software.

That's not only Ubuntu. I also contributed a lot to The elementary Project (I wrote the <nowiki>[[http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~elementary-os/elementaryos/eBuild/changes/10?start_revid=250|first version of all their build scripts]]</nowiki> for elementary Jupiter,<nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~gotwig/+archive/eplytest|packaged some stuff]]</nowiki>), and  distro independent applications.

'''Now I see that its more important to go upstream.'''

Not only because of that, but also because of the really awesome opportunities of independent hardware and software programming that Ubuntu Linux offers their developers (for free), I came back to Ubuntu, to go upstream.

I translate Projects into German (PlayOnLinux website, Ubuntu Manual, Ubuntu etc.),
report different bugs, commit patches, and try to help sometimes on the German wiki at ubuntuusers.de and the 
English wiki.

I am mostly known for my cooking lens for Ubuntu Unity:

=== Testimonials ===
please add your Testimonials here. 

Eduard has been quite active in Unity discussions for some time now.  His Cooking lens, which has gathered quite a bit of buzz, really pushed the envelope of what can be done with the Dash.  I enjoy working with him and look forward to seeing what cool new things he'll be producing in the future. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:mhall119]]</nowiki> 
Edurard is an enjoyable person and an enthusiastic developer. His dedication to the creation of innovative Unity lenses is an inspiration and will probably bring more developers in the Dash. I think he is a great addition to the Ubuntu community. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:davidc3]]</nowiki>
