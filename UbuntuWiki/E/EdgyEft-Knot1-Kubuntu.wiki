=== Introduction ===
Edgy, all about cutting edge, perhaps bleeding edge, will consist of brand new code and infrastructure. The time has come to introduce some seriously interesting, but definately edgy, new technologies which lay the groundwork for the next wave of Ubuntu development.

Knot CD 1 is the first in a series of milestone CD images that will be released throughout the Edgy development cycle, as images that are known to be reasonably free of CD-build or installer bugs, while representing very current snapshots of Edgy. Kubuntu Edgy Knot releases can be downloaded:
* http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-live/current/

'''NOTE:''' ''This is an alpha (pre-) release. Pre-release version of Edgy are '''__NOT__''' encouraged for anyone needing a stable system or for anyone who is not comfortable running into occasional, even frequent, breakage. Pre-release versions of Edgy '''__ARE__''' recommended for Ubuntu developers and those who want to help in testing, reporting, and fixing bugs.''

'''Installation bug note:''' ''The released CD has a bug in the installer, requiring localechooser-data to be installed in order for it to work. Using Adept (or your favourite package tool) to install this should solve the problem. Please see <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/ubiquity/+bug/56721|bug #56721]]</nowiki> and do not file any more bugs on this issue.''
