Hi, my Real Name is David Rando.

I'm from Málaga, South of Spain.

I work with computers, being with computers since i'm 9 (and i'm 30), do customer support, network implementation, programming...... more or less, i touch almost everything i can and i'm able to ;-)

Ubuntu is the best linux distro i've used, and because of its of treat linux, i support it, distribute it, and at last i've been able to leave only windows for just gaming. I'm starting to use linux on enterprises too.

So always when i have the chance, i collaborate with it, translating, giving support on forums and trying to help with bugs.
