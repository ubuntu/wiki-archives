=== About Me ===

I'm a 31 year old father of three living in the United States, in the Bluegrass State of Kentucky. By day, I am a Network Administrator supporting mostly Windows machines. I have been using Linux (Ubuntu, Gentoo, Red Hat, Suse, Slackware) for about 4 years now. My Linux journey began when I started learning Perl. I was writing my code on a Red Hat 8 machine and a friend challenged me to use a distro that wasn't so easy. He said that I should try to run Slackware. So I did. He kept giving me challenges, and in the process I was getting deeper and deeper into Linux. 

==== Enter Ubuntu ====

Late 2005, a friend introduced me to Ubuntu - then version 5.10. At the time, I was using Gentoo and Suse and really wasn't impressed with what Ubuntu offered. In November of that year, I changed jobs. Within the first few weeks, I had a Suse box running on the network monitoring the servers. One of the other members of the IT staff saw that I was running Linux and wanted to know more about it. I happened to have some Ubuntu CDs with me and gave him one to try. Since he was brand new to Linux, I thought that it would be good for me to set up a machine myself to run Ubuntu. That way, I could see what he was seeing when questions came up. At that point, I was hooked. I have been using Ubuntu since and have never looked back.

In January 2007, I co-founded the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KentuckyTeam|Kentucky LoCo Team]]</nowiki>. The team started as a small group of three and in the first month grew to 15. We have some big plans for this year. The biggest of which is to start a <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KentuckyTeam/CharityProject|Charity]]</nowiki> project that will focus on providing PCs to people that can not afford to purchase one. Of course, pre-loaded with Ubuntu.
