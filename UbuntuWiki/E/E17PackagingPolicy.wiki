=== Summary ===

This Specification describes the way for package / maintain any packages of the E17 Ubuntu repository.
This project has been created by <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/people/maxenced|Maxence DUNNEWIND]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/people/lutin.|Albin Tonnerre]]</nowiki>. 
It is owned by <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/people/e17-ubuntu-maintainers|E17 Ubuntu Maintainers team]]</nowiki>.

Any people who would help can easily help us :)

=== Rationale ===

Due the increasing number of packages in the repository, we have to decide/respect a packaging method. This is also very important because the script used to update repository from CVS works better if all the packages use the same properties.

=== Use cases ===

Please read and use this spec if you want to help e17-ubuntu-maintainers team.

=== Design ===

For a basic documentation about how to create a package, please have a look at <nowiki>[[http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide/index.html]]</nowiki>. Localized versions are available at http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide/index.XX.html , with XX your locale.

For better compatibility with update script, you should prefer CDBS ( you can take a look at <nowiki>[[http://perso.duckcorp.org/duck/cdbs-doc/cdbs-doc.xhtml]]</nowiki> ).
However, this is _not_ a critical point, and package don't be rejected because of that.

=== Implementation ===

Your package _must_ respect all this items :

** All the standard policy from the Ubuntu distribution apply, plus additional points detailed below.
** The debian/ repository from upstream _must_ be replaced by your debian/. That means we DO NOT WANT YOU to use native debian packaging.
** The package description '''should ''' have a link points to <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/products/e17-repository/]]</nowiki>. You may put this link in README.debian.
** The package version must use the classical Ubuntu tag method. (<package>-<upstream_version>-<e17_revision>-<ubuntu>-<package_revision>). In the classic way, the packaged name will be <package>-<upstream_version>-0ubuntuX . '''Warning''' : You have to upgrade the X each time your package will be updated!. Please note that upstream_version should include the cvs date, eg $version+cvs2006xxxx
** The package must be compiled on an Ubuntu sane system, using pbuilder. See Ubuntu wiki for more infos on using pbuilder.

Failing to comply with these points will range from preventing package upload to simple lintian warnings.

=== Issues ===

 Packaging issue should be reported at <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/products/e17-repository/+bugs]]</nowiki>. If a bug appears don't depend of packaging, it will be rejected and you 'll have to report it to upstream.

=== Packages ===

 Those packages are already in the repository :

** Enlightenment Foundation Libraries: ecore, edje, eet, embryo, evas
** Extra Enlightenement-Related libs: emotion, engrave, epeg, epsilon, esmart, etk, exml, enhance, ewl and imlib2 (1.3.0)
** Apps: Enlightenment, e_modules, e_utils (somewhat deprecated), examine, engage, exhibit, estickies, ephoto and enna (temporarly unavailable) (entrance is also actively worked on)
** Other : enlightenment-theme

 If you want to contribute, please add yourself and the name of the package you'd like to maintain to this list and contact us.

=== Other participation way ===
If you don't know how packaging at all, you could help us if you have a  computer with special arch (amd64 , ppc , and others).
In this case, please contact us at <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/people/e17-ubuntu-maintainers]]</nowiki> .
