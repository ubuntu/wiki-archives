====== Lindependence 2008: July 28-August 4, 2008 ======

Lindependence 2008 introduces the town of Felton, California, to Linux and FOSS programs so they can go "Microsoft free" for a week with the intention for most (if not all) of them to remain on the proverbial Linux side of the digital fence.

Throughout the month of July -- the first two meetings have been scheduled for Sunday, July 13 and Tuesday, July 15, "town meetings" and installfests will take place to familiarize those who wish to participate in the project, with the week of digital freedom starting on July 28. The first two meetings on the 13th and 15th will be held at the hall at the Felton Presbyterian Church, 6090 Highway 9, in Felton; the Sunday (7/13) event is from 3 to 7 p.m. and the Tuesday (7/15) event is from 6 to 10 p.m.

Updates on other meetings throughout July will be posted here.

Ubuntu's participation in this project would be a vital component, and members of the California Ubuntu LoCo are welcome and urged to participate in this project.
