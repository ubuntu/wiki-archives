== About Me ==

I've been an Ubuntu user since Dapper and never looked back.
I live in Argentina and currently studying for a science degrees in physics.

== What I've done ==

* I have join the Argentina LoCo team, with which we have accomplished a lot in translations (UWN's and Rosetta), and introduced many new users to Ubuntu. 
* I have translated several pages about Ubuntu, like http://www.eternal1.com.ar/ubuntu, http://www.chaumicrosoft.com.ar, http://www.porquelinuxesmejor.com.ar

The thing I probably enjoyed the most is introducing users to Ubuntu.

== What I want to do ==

* Making the Argentina LoCo team grow as much and as healthy as possible, and eventually get it officially approved.
* Playing around with the latest "in production" Ubuntu to help squash bugs before release and help users get through the upgrade process easier.
* Translating in Rosetta
