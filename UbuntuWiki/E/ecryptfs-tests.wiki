Proposed tests for ecryptfs.  Some are way too vague.

   1. make sure the backing file for an ecryptfs file is not plaintext
   2. umount and remount ecryptfs with wrong key, make sure file is bad
   3. create files of various size (0..32k; then larger in larger strides)
   4. repeatedly write to then truncate
   5. out of band verification of the encryption
   6. (some set of filename encryption tests)
   7. pam-ecryptfs test
      a. create a new user with encrypted home;
      b. log in as the user, create file; log out and in, make sure file is there;
      c. log out, make sure file is not there
      d. su to $user, make sure the file is not there
