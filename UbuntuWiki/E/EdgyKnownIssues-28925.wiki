At the cd boot prompt menu, press F6 to edit kernel options. Remove <code>splash</code> and add <code>break=bottom</code>. Press Enter to start the kernel.

<pre>
chroot /root nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
</pre>

Find the "Device" section and change the <code>Driver</code> by replacing "ati" by "radeon". You can jump to the right place by searching: ctrl-W <code>"ati"</code> Enter
<pre>
    Driver   "radeon"
