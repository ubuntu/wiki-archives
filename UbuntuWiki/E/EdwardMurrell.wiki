Email: 
I'm the Sysadmin for a small company where we run predominately Ubuntu and Debian. I'm a big proponent of making Linux really secure on the corporate LAN, and have implemented the network with LDAP, Kerberos, and NFSv4, and am in the process of moving all those web applications over to using automagic Kerberos authentication.
