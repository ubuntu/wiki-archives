__TOC__


== Overview ==

This is the home page for Ubuntu English translations.

Our intention is to maintain a central communications channel for en-GB based languages. Generally, this includes the forms of English spoken in Commonwealth countries such as the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-l10n-en-gb|United Kingdom]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[IndianTeam|India]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[AustralianTranslationTeam|Australia]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[SouthAfricanTeam|South Africa]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[CanadianTeam|Canada]]</nowiki>.

These variants are almost identical in their written forms, so it makes sense for some communication and co-operation to take place. We hope to eliminate the duplication of effort that is currently taking place in regards to translations.

Our translations are based on <nowiki>[[https://translations.launchpad.net/ubuntu/karmic/+lang/en_GB|British English]]</nowiki>. That effort is headquartered <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-l10n-en-gb|here]]</nowiki>. Essentially, we are producing an internationalised form of en_GB.

We do not intend to restrict the activities of local translation groups, but rather to provide a common base for everyone to build upon. Through co-operation, we hope to strengthen rather than weaken localised versions of English.

== How to Participate ==

Joining the Ubuntu English (United Kingdom) Translators team allows you to commit translations and vote on policies. If you are not a member, your contributions will need to be approved by a member. The procedure for joining is as follows.

# Sign up for a <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/|Launchpad account]]</nowiki>.
# Make your e-mail address visible on your Launchpad homepage so that we can get in touch with you. If we cannot contact you, you cannot join.
# Apply to join the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-l10n-en-gb|Ubuntu English (United Kingdom) Translators team]]</nowiki>
# Sign up to the <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-l10n-eng|ubuntu-l10n-eng mailing list]]</nowiki>
# An Administrator should e-mail you. Reply to their message.

The team is moderated, meaning that you need to be approved by an Administrator before you are allowed to join. Membership is dependent upon:

* adequate command of the written English language to qualify as a translator
* ability to contribute constructively and work as a team under the leadership of the Administrators
* following established guidelines and directions
* remaining contactable via the mailing list

Don't let these requirements scare you off, though. Provided you have decent written English language skills, you will likely be admitted.

== Communication ==

Our primary communications channel is our <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-l10n-eng|mailing list]]</nowiki>.

== Tools ==

=== Table of translations ===
The bulk of our translation effort is simple word substitution. To streamline this process and to maintain consistency, we are compiling a <nowiki>[[EnglishTranslation-WordSubstitution|table of translations]]</nowiki>. Please help us by contributing to that table. As a quick guide, refer to our ''table of common translations'', below.

For the ''Check Spelling'' function on the wiki to function correctly, we should also add our words to the <nowiki>[[LocalSpellingWords|Local Spelling Words]]</nowiki> list.

=== Rosetta ===
Our primary tool is <nowiki>[[https://translations.launchpad.net/|Rosetta]]</nowiki>, Ubuntu's Web-based translation tool. To get started, consult the <nowiki>[[TranslatingUbuntu|Translation Team portal]]</nowiki> and the <nowiki>[[https://help.launchpad.net/LaunchpadTranslationsFAQ|FAQ list]]</nowiki>.

Although already an excellent tool, Rosetta suffers from a number of <nowiki>[[https://blueprints.launchpad.net/rosetta|deficiencies]]</nowiki> that may be of hindrance to our project. These issues are currently being addressed:

* <nowiki>[[https://blueprints.launchpad.net/rosetta/+spec/similar-languages|Similar Languages]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[https://blueprints.launchpad.net/rosetta/+spec/language-glossary-links|Language Glossary Links]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[https://blueprints.launchpad.net/rosetta/+spec/the-english-language|The English Language]]</nowiki>

=== Greasemonkey script ===
Team member <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/people/malcolm-parsons|Malcolm Parsons]]</nowiki> maintains a <nowiki>[[http://pepsiman.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/translate.user.js|Greasemonkey script]]</nowiki> to ease the translation process in Rosetta. It is updated at irregular intervals, so you will need to update periodically. Be sure to remove any previously installed versions before installing a new version.

Note that the script merely makes suggestions for word substitutions (based on <nowiki>[[EnglishTranslation-WordSubstitution|our table of translations]]</nowiki>). It does not check punctuation, grammar or style. It would be unfeasible for us (or evidently anyone else) to produce an automated corrector of these elements, so they must be assessed manually.

Requirements:
* <nowiki>[[http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/|Mozilla Firefox]]</nowiki>
* the <nowiki>[[http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/|Greasemonkey]]</nowiki> extension
or
* <nowiki>[[http://www.gnome.org/projects/epiphany/|Epiphany]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[http://www.gnome.org/projects/epiphany/extensions|Epiphany extensions]]</nowiki>
* The Greasemonkey extension from the above package enabled (Tools>Extensions).

Screenshots: <nowiki>[[http://pepsiman.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/launchpad_with_greasemonkey.png|One]]</nowiki> | <nowiki>[[http://pepsiman.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/launchpad_with_greasemonkey2.png|Two]]</nowiki>

== Translation Guidelines ==

Unless they conflict with the information given below, translations should be based on the following dictionaries:

* the <nowiki>[[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/Default.asp?dict=CALD|Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary]]</nowiki>
* the <nowiki>[[http://www.askoxford.com/dictionaries/compact_oed/?view=uk|Oxford English Dictionary]]</nowiki>
* the <nowiki>[[http://www.collins.co.uk/wordexchange/|Collins Dictionary]]</nowiki>
* the <nowiki>[[http://www.chambersharrap.co.uk/chambers/chref/chref.py/main|Chambers 21st Century Dictionary]]</nowiki>

The <nowiki>[[http://live.gnome.org/BritishEnglish|GNOME]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[http://kde.me.uk/index.php?page=kde-en-gb|KDE]]</nowiki> projects have established guidelines for their own translation efforts. <nowiki>[[http://en-gb.pyxidium.co.uk/|Pyxidium Limited]]</nowiki> has been doing some good work with Ope``nOffic``e.org and Mozilla localisations.

=== Table of common translations ===

=== Dialectical/Contextual Differences ===

Since our goal is to provide a common base for English, one must be mindful of the use of English internationally, and the differences between dialects and contexts (nouns/verbs, computing/non-computing, etc.). Below is a list of differences that should be reconciled. We will use the mailing list to discuss such matters.
