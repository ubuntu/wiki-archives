=== Enrique Matías Sánchez (Quique) ===

Email:  

I am a systems technician at the <nowiki>[[http://www.unizar.es|University of Zaragoza]]</nowiki>, Spain.  I've been using Debian on my desktops since 1999 (Slink).  I am a member of some Free Software groups, such as <nowiki>[[http://pulsar.unizar.es|Púlsar]]</nowiki>.  As such, I organized a talk by RMS in Zaragoza on July 2003.  I am one of the editors of <nowiki>[[http://barrapunto.com|BarraPunto]]</nowiki> (kind of Spanish Slashdot), and one of the authors of the book ''Ciberactivismo.  Sobre usos políticos y sociales de la red''.  My vanity domain is <nowiki>[[http://cronopios.net|Cronopios.Net]]</nowiki>.

=== Tasks ===

* I intend to work on Spanish translation and documentation.  I have quite a fair amount of experience writing/translating for the Spanish magazine `Mundo Linux', as well as on other teams such as KDE-es and FDP-es.
