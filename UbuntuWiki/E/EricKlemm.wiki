Hello, I am Eric Klemm, helping to start the Ubuntu KansasTeam LoCo . I am ad astra 23 on ubuntuforums.com and on irc. 

I Always have a live CD with me, ready to show off what Ubuntu does, because that's how it started with me, I had always been interested in finding out more about Linux, and after a friend showed me the LiveCD in action, (Breezy days) he gave it to me, I learned a little and when I was ready, a few years later I installed it for real. 

I am available at ericklemm@gmail.com
