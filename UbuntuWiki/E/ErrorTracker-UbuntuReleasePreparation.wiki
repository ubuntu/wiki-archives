__TOC__

* Uncomment lines for the -proposed branch of the just-released version of Ubuntu in the retracer configuration.
* Add retracer configuration for the next release, without -proposed (as that is only a build/test staging area); leave the previous release's ddeb sources in place as well, as ddebs.u.c. indexes do not currently copy those to the new release
