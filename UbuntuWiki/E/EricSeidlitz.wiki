I'm an American, but have lived in Malaysia for over four years. I've been using Ubuntu since June 2005, and this is my first Linux distro. I still consider myself very much a beginner and rely heavily on <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntuforums.org|Ubuntu Forums]]</nowiki> when I get stuck on something. Still, I like Ubuntu and want to be involved as much as I can, so I'm going to work on translating stuff into Malay. My Malay isn't perfect, but it's not bad, so I feel fairly confident I can help with the easier things to translate.

<nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/people/seidlitz/+translations|Here]]</nowiki> is my Translations page on Launchpad. I'm currently working on:
