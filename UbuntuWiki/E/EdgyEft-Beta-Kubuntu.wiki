__TOC__

== Introduction ==
Edgy, all about cutting edge, perhaps bleeding edge, will consist of brand new code and infrastructure. The time has come to introduce some seriously interesting, but definitely edgy, new technologies that lay the groundwork for the next wave of Ubuntu development.

Beta is the fourth in a series of milestone CD images that will be released throughout the Edgy development cycle as images known to be reasonably free of CD-build or installer bugs. They represent very current snapshots of Edgy. Kubuntu 6.10 Beta releases can be downloaded from the following URL:
* http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/releases/edgy/

'''NOTE:''' ''This is a beta (pre-) release. Pre-release versions of Edgy are '''__NOT__''' encouraged for anyone needing a stable system or not comfortable running into occasional, even frequent, breakage. Pre-release versions of Edgy '''__ARE__''' recommended for Ubuntu developers and those who want to help in testing, reporting, and fixing bugs.''

=== USplash ===
The first thing you will notice upon booting your newly installed Kubuntu 6.10 Beta system, is the redefined Kubuntu USplash. The new USplash is sporting the new glossy logo with throbber. You may also notice that the USplash is much quieter now, meaning you don't see every little system message upon booting up.
