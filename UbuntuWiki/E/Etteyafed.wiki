==== Me ====
 My technical knowledge is mostly self taught, but I always try to learn from others. I began using GNU/Linux in 1999 With Red Hat and never looked back, even though it needed a great deal of work at the time. At age 8 I learned to program in BASIC on an Apple IIC but never learned C/C++ until I was in high school. Still, I don't know why I haven't gotten involved in the community before now. I hope to improve my skills and contribute to the improvement of FOSS available to the world.

==== Right now. ====
Right now is a bit unproductive for me.
