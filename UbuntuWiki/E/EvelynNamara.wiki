__TOC__

My Name is Evelyn Namara, 

I work with Linux Solutions Uganda. Linux Solutions Uganda is one of the pioneer companies in Uganda and the rest of Africa at large that has the lead in use of FLOSS as a company and extending the use of Free /Libre Open Source Software to our clients.

I work as a Technical Support Engineer, and thus my work deals more in offering Technical support to the clients we support.

The kind of solutions that Linux Solutions gives are based on Open Source Software.

I love Linux and Open Source Software so much, I started using Linux not so long ago but what keeps me going is the passion i have inside my heart to know more and more each day.

Am a member of Africa LinuxChix, and a country representative of Uganda LinuxChix.

Am a member of Ubuntu Women and am so glad to be part of this. I love Ubuntu Linux and all i want is to find help and also help out when i can to make Ubuntu - Women acheive its purpose.
