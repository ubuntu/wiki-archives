==== What ====

Edubuntu is a new school-focused derivative of the popular Ubuntu
operating system. We would like to collaborate with the community as
much as possible in the development of Edubuntu, and therefore would
like you to join us at the inaugural Edubuntu Summit which will be held
in Central London (England) on 1-3 July 2005. 

Edubuntu is an Ubuntu ( http://www.ubuntu.com ) version suitable for
classroom use. We integrate the excellent work of many of the existing
initiatives for Linux in education and so are working with groups such
as the K12-LTSP project, SkoleLinux / Debian-Edu, and the upstream LTSP
community to produce a best-of-breed Linux that schools and school
districts can use as a basis for their needs. 

One key goal is that it be easy to modify and customise Edubuntu, to
produce a locally branded and updated educational distro with additional
apps and content of local relevance. 
 
If you could not attend the event, but would like to contribute to or
follow Edubuntu's progress, please join our mailing list at
http://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/edubuntu-devel and keep an eye
on our wiki at http://www.edubuntu.org
