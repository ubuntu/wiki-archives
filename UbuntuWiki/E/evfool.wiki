=== About Me ===

I have first met Ubuntu in 2005, don't remember exactly the release. I liked it, but it had lots of issues. In 2008, it became my primary OS, but still dual-booting with windows for university needs. Recently I use Ubuntu on both of my computers, one still has Windows for emergencies.

I have successfully introduced Ubuntu to a few friends, most of them use it as primary OS now.

==== Socially ====

My main area  of interest is contributing to open-source projects, but I also like watching movies, listening and playing music (guitar and piano), playing board games with friends and taking photos.

==== Professionally ====

I'm a Software Developer working in Romania.  I have been working as a Java developer in small development teams, I have done server-side development using various frameworks, I have some client-side Flex experience, and I'm currently working as an Android developer.

I am interested in learning new programming tricks and languages, technologies, frameworks, mostly related to open-source.

=== Contributions ===

==== Summary ====

Since I have started contributing to Ubuntu about two years ago, I have contributed with translations, bug reports, bug triaging, patches and branches and packaging. In 2011 I have been focusing both my triaging and bugfixing efforts towards package management related tools in Ubuntu. Since November 2011 I am focusing actively on GNOME System Monitor with triaging, bugfixing and getting the fixes accepted upstream.  

==== Translations ====

Hungarian being my mother tongue, I have started contributing by doing translations on launchpad for various projects. 

==== Bugs ====

{*} I have participated in some bug days.

{*} I have triaged bugs regularly, depending on the situation weekly, or even daily.

{*} I have followed and helped the papercuts project where I could.

{*} I have reported the bugs I have found on my computers, and occasionally forwarded the bugs my friends have found and told me about.

{*} I have organized a <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBugDay/20110210|BugDay for OpenOffice and LibreOffice]]</nowiki>

{*} I got accepted as a member of the Ubuntu Bug Control Team on 2011/03/11

{*} I have been sponsored for my contributions by the QA team for UDS-O and UDS-P (unfortunately I could not attend UDS-P in person)

{*} I have relatively good five-a-day stats (30 days in a row, 12 weeks in a row)

==== Development ====

I have contributed with patches to GNOME upstream for various projects, but mostly gnome-system-monitor, to fix ancient bugs reported in Ubuntu, but still existing. I have become the maintainer of GNOME System Monitor in Ubuntu, so it has become my main focus for 2012.

I have been working on package management tools used in Ubuntu, I was triaging and fixing most bugs for (and got into the top contributors list for some of) the packages related to this topic, like

{*} update-manager

{*} software-properties

{*} synaptic

{*} software-center

{*} aptdaemon

{*} update-notifier

I have contributed with patches and branches for bugfixes for more projects: gcalctool, jockey, ubuntu-docs, libreoffice, ubiquity-slideshow-ubuntu, ubuntuone-control-panel, checkbox, usb-creator-gtk.

I have implemented a simple feature for nautilus elementary, the categorized sidebar with the help and guidance of ammonkey, the main nautilus elementary developer.

=== Objectives for 2010-2011 ===

{*} DONE (*gnome-system-monitor) Dig into an open-source project deeper to be able to fix bugs and implement new features (FUN!). 

{*} DONE (*~50 posts, almost one post a week) I write a <nowiki>[[http://dailydoseofubuntu.blogspot.com | blog]]</nowiki>.  I blog about my experiences with ubuntu, ubuntu and development news, and misc thoughts. It's far from being daily, but I would like to post regularly.

=== Objectives for 2011-2012 ===

{*} Close one bug in GNOME System Monitor weekly (either upstream or in Ubuntu)

{*} I am still writing a <nowiki>[[http://dailydoseofubuntu.blogspot.com | blog]]</nowiki>.  I would like to update it with news, development statuses and other stuff regularly (not necessarily daily)

=== Development ===

In my spare time I'm developing some simple games in Python (learning the language). My first almost-complete Python game is a minesweeper clone using GTK only, check the screenshots on <nowiki>[[http://dailydoseofubuntu.blogspot.com/2011/03/emines-update.html | my blog]]</nowiki>. 
Currently I'm working on the next one, a Tetris clone, also with GTK only, and I've also managed to embed pyGame in a GTK window, for building more graphics-intensive games (GTK is not the best for this) later.

=== Testimonials ===

==== UBT Membership ====
Yikes! I've just had a quick read through of what he does (and his karma score on lp). Deffinately one of the back office people who just 'get on with it'. I have no hesitation in backing up <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UndiFineD#evfool| UndifineD's comment]]</nowiki> of 'He is too good to be a beginner'. I am sure he would make an excellent addition to UBT <nowiki>[[phillw]]</nowiki> 3rd June 2011 21:30 UTC

==== Ubuntu Membership ====
As per my comments for UBT Membership, I certainly have no qualms for when he feels ready to apply for his full Ubuntu membership. I look forward to seeing his commitment to Ubuntu and F/OSS in general grow. He is an excellent advocate and the amount of time he spends on Ubuntu is amazing. <nowiki>[[phillw]]</nowiki> 3rd June 2011 21:40 UTC

* Robert Roth has done a great job fixing many bugs in Ubuntu and I would definitely support him for Ubuntu membership. One recent fix I looked into was https://code.launchpad.net/~evfool/computer-janitor/fix728235/+merge/52466, but there have been others as well. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:dholbach]]</nowiki>
