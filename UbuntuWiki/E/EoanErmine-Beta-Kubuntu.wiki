<nowiki>[[File:EoanPlasma800.png||width=800]]</nowiki>

<nowiki>[[https://www.kde.org/announcements/plasma-5.16.0.php|Plasma 5.16]]</nowiki> has been developed to make it smoother to use while retaining the familiar setup. Kubuntu ships the 4th scheduled bugfix release of 5.16 (5.16.5). 

==== KDE Applications 19.04.3 ====

<nowiki>[[File:EoanApps800.png||width=800]]</nowiki>

Kubuntu comes with <nowiki>[[https://kde.org/announcements/announce-applications-19.04.3.php|KDE Applications 19.04.3]]</nowiki> containing all your favourite apps from KDE. Provided is the 19.04.3 update with bugfixes and translation updates.

=== Plasma Wayland session ===

* A Plasma Wayland session can be added by installing the package '''plasma-workspace-wayland''', '''but is not supported'''. This will add a  Plasma (wayland) session option at the login scree. Users needing a stable desktop experience should select the normal 'Plasma' (without Wayland) option at login.

All KDE4 libraries and applications have been removed from the 19.10 archive, and are therefore not supported.

== Known Problems ==
