=== About Ethan Kurt ===

Hello! It's me, <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ethan-kurt|Ethan Kurt]]</nowiki>, I am the Core Member of <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MyanmarTeam|Ubuntu Myanmar LoCo Team]]</nowiki>. I'm Buddhist and proud to be Buddhism. <<BR>>
I live in Yangon Myanmar (Previously called Rangoon, Burma). <<BR>>
I Love Ubuntu and Traveling with --(My Team )-- <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/people/ubuntu-mm|Our Team]]</nowiki> <<BR>>
for sharing the knowledge of Ubuntu. I've done participating in Barcamp Yangon, Barcamp Mandalay, Barcamp Pathein, Barcamp Loikaw and Barcamp Lashio to share the Ubuntu Customization DVDs, ~+How to+~ {*} and {*} ~+Localization+~. <<BR>> 
I like to travel around the Myanmar and doing localization. I hate to contribute by being working in front of the computer because
I am sure that is not effective localization. In our country, most of people doesn't know what is Ubuntu. They don't even know
what is the Linux and how much powerful it is. So, if we do want to localize the Ubuntu in Myanmar, we must go directly to them
and share what is Ubuntu, how to use it, which are the advantages of its, how to use it, how much powerful it is and so on.
This is the reason why we are travelling around the Myanmar and doing localization. <<BR>>
I am still continue to participating with the Ubuntu Myanmar LoCo Team as a Core Member for Localization.  <<BR>> 

I am doing Ubuntu localization because I love Ubuntu. <<BR>>
Because of Ubuntu, I am clear what is the real freedom. <<BR>>
Because of Ubuntu, I love the Open Source. <<BR>>
Because of Ubuntu, I've got totally nice experience which I never had with Windows. <<BR>>
Because of Ubuntu, I know what is team working. <<BR>>
Because of Ubuntu, I definitely understand what is Humanity. <<BR>>
Because of Ubuntu, ... ... ... ... ..... <<BR>>
Thank you and Love you Ubuntu ......  <<BR>>

Currently, I am working at IT Company as a IT Manager and I am sharing the Ubuntu knowledge to my co-worker and customer whenever I've got a chance. Likewise, I am the Ubuntu instructor and technical supporter of Yangon City Development Committee (<nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangon_City_Development_Committee|YCDC]]</nowiki>).  

I have played around with Linux since 2008. Initially, I was a Fedora user and I changed to Ubuntu on 8.04. Once I changed into Ubuntu user, I will always be the Ubuntu user because Ubuntu is very powerful and more comfortable for me. Currently I have Ubuntu 12.04 LTS installed on both of my computers, as well as a couple of virtual computers that are mainly used for networking and programming. I am the power user of Linux Operation System. I am using the Ubuntu for not only Desktop edition but also Server edition. Currently, I am preparing the Getting Start with Ubuntu 12.10 User Guide in Myanmar. I am also trying to develop the Myanmar Keyboard and English to Myanmar - Myanmar to English Dictionary for Ubuntu Touch.
I am the Cisco Certified and studying the LPIC and RHCSA. I can contribute the Ubuntu very well and I am not just like the translation guys.
Most of the localize Myanmar translators are using the Microsoft Windows (Pirate) and they don't even know how to install the Ubuntu OS.
Anytime you can check my activities and compare with the other. I am not doing the localization by sitting in front of the PC without doing any activities and never participating with the team.   

In Ubuntu Myanmar LoCo Team, I, Ethan, is helping out with the <nowiki>[[https://www.facebook.com/groups/ubuntu4mm|Ubuntu Myanmar Facebook group]]</nowiki> and Ubuntu Myanmar LoCo Team's Movement. No matter what I am the Ubuntu Member or not, I will continue to localize and contribute the Ubuntu.
Most of my time have been passing by contributing the Ubuntu. So, I just want to be acknowledged. Thank you for your consideration and your time spend on me.
