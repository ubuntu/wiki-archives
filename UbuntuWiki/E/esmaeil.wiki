Hi

welcome to this page. My name is Esmaeil MIRZAEE(It was not my choice, I love to call me Samuel). I'm junior computer science student. when I was 7 years old My dad bought me an Amiga after that time I involved with computer when I feel in love to robotic and I tried to went to competition I involved with OpenSuSE after that time I think more than 10 years I love linux and try to learn them completely.

I born in 4 Dec 1985. I learn C/C++ when I was 20 years old. at this time I'm familiar with Python(lovely), Bash, Assembly(for X86 and try to learn for ARM).

My interesting area at this moment is Linux Kernel, Distributed system and Computer Architecture. One month ago I began to Install Simplescalar in ubuntu 10.10 and I try to write proper How can install in ubuntu? in my blog.

I know my English isn't good but I learned all of things without any help and this is really bad. I try to learn English by my self.

Best
Samuel
