This project is going to be big, and require some real work.  We will be installing and supporting an Ubuntu Network for the <nowiki>[[http://www.endorphinpower.org|The Endorphin Power Company]]</nowiki>

This project was started on October 1st, 2007, due to the generous donation of 25 computers to the The Endorphin Power Company by Charter Bank of Albuquerque, New Mexico.  The New Mexico Ubuntu LoCo is in the process of installing the Ubuntu operating system on the donated computers, as well as negotiating a service level agreement to provide limited support and training for The Endorphin Power Company.

The Endorphin Power Company is dedicated to improving the lives of people, with special focus on the substance-dependent and homeless, thus alleviating many of the challenges faced by current emergency medical systems. Additional purposes are the promotion of mental and physical health through exercise, and the promotion of energy consciousness and voluntarism.

==== EPC Project Updates ====

'''8/15/09'''

Fantastic morning updating the EPC computer Lab to Ubuntu 9.04 we had a little surprise EPC remodeled the library. So check out the great new floor and walls. The good news is they had plenty of people on hand to re-setup the computers. We also added more work stations they now have 10 stations. The mesh network is still running great too. This project just keeps getting better.<<BR>>
A Huge thanks goes to all those that helped doomcat, clayjar, gcleric, jimrz, nick125, ColonelPanik, and of course David from EPC great job! Check out all the fun<<BR>>

'''12/22/2008''' 

I just wanted to thank everyone that helped out with the EPC Computer
Lab upgrade to Ubuntu Linux Release 8.04 (Hardy).  The upgrade went
flawlessly! Even the Mikes nemesis the Sony PC. =)

After talking with everyone i think that taking a hard look at
converting the lab to LTSP (http://www.ltsp.org/) now that Dave has the
PE 4400 Server up and running - great job Dave! - running LTSP may be an
option now. 

Some further reading on LTSP can be found here...
