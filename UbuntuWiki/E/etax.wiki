__TOC__

E-tax is software made by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) that enables Australian employers/employees and taxpayers to lodge their tax return online. Being a Windows program, it does not run natively on Ubuntu so you'll need to either use Wine or a VirtualBox set-up to run e-tax on Ubuntu.

=== E-tax on Ubuntu using Wine ===

To use e-tax on Ubuntu, you'll need to install Wine. Wine can be use to run Windows programs on Ubuntu. To install Wine, either run:

sudo apt-get install wine

Or open up the Ubuntu Software Centre and search for Wine - it's in the universe repository.
