=== Agenda ===

* Define Primary Aim: Functional (upgrades) vs. Exposure (introduce people to Ubuntu)

* Venue considerations/needs (i.e. high speed internet vs. available for exposure) 
* Venue options (follows on date and time and other considerations)
* Identify further actions items / next meeting time

=== Decisions Taken ===

* Should be in internally focused informal meeting 
* Aimed at promoting the new features of 12.04 (through presentations) 
* Also aimed at helping those present to upgrade using a cached server 

=== Discussions Deferred ===

* Date, Time and Venue were hard to define - Was decided to discuss these at the next monthly meetup

=== Offers for resources ===

* Haden offered to prepare a cached server that everyone can upgrade from (no need for internet)
* DirkT offered to prepare a wireless point he can tether onto GPRS/3G for those who need internet
 
=== Deepest Desire for Launch Party ===

* It was discussed and suggested the best and most unique party we could have would be in the desert somewhere 

=== Actions to follow ===

* Discussion about the release party will continue at next weeks monthly meeting (on Wednesday 1st February)
