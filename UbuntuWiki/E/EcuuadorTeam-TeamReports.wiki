== Ubuntu Ecuador LoCo Team Reports ==

Monthly reports of what we are doing in our location ;)

=== January 2008 ===

* Got new content and opened access (wiki-style) for all pages on our website <nowiki>[[http://ubuntu.ec|ubuntu.ec]]</nowiki> so development of the Ecuadorian Ubuntu portal is now continuing in a much faster pace.
* We got hosting space and help setting up our domain for our website donated by members of the local FLOSS community - Thanks [Alex http://alex.conlinux.net] and the whole  <nowiki>[[http://conlinux.net|ConLinux.net]]</nowiki> team for this!
* A more solid team is starting to build up as people use the same platforms to communicate (our forums and wiki mostly getting mroe popular and the number of members in the site).
* T-shirts by alfermp-ecubuntu
