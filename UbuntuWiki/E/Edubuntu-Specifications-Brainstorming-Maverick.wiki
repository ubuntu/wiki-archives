__TOC__

== Ideas ==

=== Artwork ===

* Plymouth text-fallbacks
** Have both text and vga16 logos for fallback on non-KMS hardware
* Split edubuntu-artwork package to edubuntu-art, edubuntu-livecd and edubuntu-settings
** Migrate the slideshow to ubiquity-slideshow-edubuntu and have it merged inside the same source branch as the others (ubiquity-slideshow)

=== LTSP ===
* Edubuntu remote network installer
** Basically like Live LTSP but booting the DVD, letting you install more computers from a single DVD
* Quiet down PXELinux
** Not really Edubuntu-specific but a good idea generally, would be interesting to poke upstream about it
* Split LTSP packages so that scripts is not in main package
** LP: #xxxxxx (that'll make lamont happy ;))

=== Installer ===
* Remove less fonts at end of the installation (takes quite long currently)
** Find a way to optimize removing of a lot of software (session/talk with Colin about that at UDS-M)
* Move our current post-install scripts to actual ubiquity code
** Get them translated
** Have them use nice screenshots to show the various options ;)

=== Packaging/seeds work ===
* Sugar
* http://www.jonobacon.org/2010/04/08/making-programming-easier-for-kids-with-pyjunior
* Migrate Edubuntu packages to bzr branches ("they already are", lp:ubuntu/edubuntu-artwork for example with the  new branch-based package management)
* OpenLDAP/Kerberos integration (server team stuff initially but then to be used for edubuntu) (see mail to edubuntu-devel from Velli-Matti Lindu)
* Kiwix / Wikipedia
* <nowiki>[[Edubuntu-Specifications-HigherLevelEduPackages|Higher Level Education Package]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[SchoolTool-Maverick|SchoolTool]]</nowiki>

=== Translations ===
* Edubuntu-specific translations (like ubiquity-slideshow)
** For that specific case, it'll be solved by merging our slideshow with the "upstream" package (ubiquity-slideshow)

=== Wiki ===
* Game listings and details (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Edubuntu/AppTemplate)

=== Community ===
* Review and consolidate the current education groups in launchpad (https://blueprints.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/education-launchpad-groups)
* Encourage use of scripts in bzr script repository, also documentation of this and eventual packaging

== Actions ==
* Stéphane (stgraber) to schedule something with Colin (or a beer ? ;)) at UDS to discuss optimizing the installer
* Jonathan (highvoltage) Group above tasks into sessions for UDS
