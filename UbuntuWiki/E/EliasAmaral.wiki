== About Me ==
My name is Elias Gabriel Amaral da Silva and I live in Natal, Brazil. I speak Portuguese (of course) and something of Engrish :) . I study on <nowiki>[[http://www.ufrn.br|Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte]]</nowiki>. Currently I use Ubuntu Edgy on my desktop PC, but I already used Ubuntu Dapper/Breezy, Debian Sarge, Red Hat and Conectiva. I know some of OCaml, Shell Script, PHP and C programming languages.

I really don't know any more to say.
