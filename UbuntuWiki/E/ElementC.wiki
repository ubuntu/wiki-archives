== About ==

ElementC had been thinking about starting an Ubunutu-Florida team for a while (After using one form of Ubuntu or another since breezy, and Mandrake (or is it Mandriva?) for a while before that) when he saw that it had been started up already. He is an active supporter in the #ubuntu-florida channel and can often be found near his desk with a bowl of cereal. Probably Cinnamon toast crunch. He plans to purchase a laptop from Dell or System76 in the near future. He spends his spare time ripping off lando's profile (Sorry, buddy.)

== Current Itch ==

Working (slowly) towards creating an amazing FPS/ adventure game that's linux exclusive (sorry, it's closed source: wouldn't want any unofficial windows ports, would we?)
