Educational games for small children

=== Summary ===

A large collection of educational games for small children.  It is meant to
become some sort of unified interface to integrate more educational
games.
 
Language-oriented games now contain vocabulary for too many languages
to list them heres.  Sounds and voices are also available for a number of
languages, check the gcompris-sound packages for your language.
 
Currently available boards include:
* learning how to use a mouse and keyboard
* learning simple arithmetics
* learning how to read an analog clock
* recognize letters after hearing their names
* reading practice
* small games (memory games, jigsaw puzzles, ...)
* etc.
 
It is designed so that it is easy to implement new boards to
GCompris.
 
A number of boards are only available if other packages are
installed, see the Suggests list for more details.
