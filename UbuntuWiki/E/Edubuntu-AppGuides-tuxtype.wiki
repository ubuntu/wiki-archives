Educational Typing Tutor Game Starring Tux

=== Summary ===

TuxTyping is an educational typing tutorial game starring
Tux, the Linux Penguin. The player guides Tux to eat fish
which are falling from the top of the screen. Each fish has a

The game is intended for children learning to type, though it
does have higher difficulty levels which even experienced
typists may find challenging.
