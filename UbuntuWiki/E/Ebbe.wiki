== Other things about me ==

I enjoy playing on my acoustic guitar (handmade in Spain). I then make some music on my computer (thank you Ardour ;) ).
I've been with Ubuntu for some years now, and my appreciation has only grown every year.
When I'm not programming, I study computer science at <nowiki>[[http://sdu.dk|Syddansk universitet]]</nowiki> in Odense.
