== Guide Notes ==
 No one knows everything and no one is born with linux knowledge, all linux gurus are (to some level) only very good with finding resources of knowledge, and in fact Ubuntu is full with such resources:
* http://search.ubuntuwire.com
* http://help.ubuntu.com
* http://manpages.ubuntut.com
* http://packages.ubuntu.com
* http://duckduckgo.com
* http://askubuntu.com
