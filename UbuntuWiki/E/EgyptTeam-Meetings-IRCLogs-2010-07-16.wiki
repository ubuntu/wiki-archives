<osama_gma> I noticed
* ** ChanServ changes topic to "Welcome to Ubuntu Egypt. "Do you Ubuntu, like I do?" | HERE!: Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid Lynx | http://www.ubuntu.com/ | SA: http://www.ubuntu.com/usn | Website beta Launch http://loco.thelinuxer.net | Meeting in session https://wiki.ubuntu.com/EgyptTeam/Meetings/Agendas/2010-07-16"
<osama_gma> ping all?
<thelinuxer> gamel keda
<d4de> PONG
<thelinuxer> as u can see the meeting agenda is in the topic
<thelinuxer> so please have a quick look
<thelinuxer> we are here today to discuss the roadmap section in our approval application
<EgyParadox> tamam
<thelinuxer> the approval application can be found here
<thelinuxer> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/EgyptTeam/ApprovalApplication
<thelinuxer> It's just a draft
<thelinuxer> we should refine it
<Sensiva> Can we add our contributions in the last EGLUG event?
<thelinuxer> and we have these ideas here https://wiki.ubuntu.com/EgyptTeam/IdeaPool
<thelinuxer> of course\
<thelinuxer> sorry i forgot to write ur name fel EGLUG contributions sections
<Sensiva> its ok :D
<thelinuxer> bas this is the experience section
<Sensiva> han7ot el youtube channel wel beta website?
<EgyParadox> thelinuxer:Momken tekteb waza3na kam cd felevent, kam nas 7adaret , etc
<thelinuxer> we don't have a problem with this section
<EgyParadox> under lucid lynx release party
<thelinuxer> please guys
<thelinuxer> the important section now is the roadmap
<EgyParadox> bekhestar
<Sensiva> ok
<EgyParadox> ok
<thelinuxer> the experience can be refined easily
<thelinuxer> because it's something that we did
<thelinuxer> we need to set a plan
<thelinuxer> we need to draw this roadmap
<thelinuxer> and say who will do what
<thelinuxer> instead on writing random points
<mgamal> thelinuxer: is Anas Emad here?
<thelinuxer> no he is not
<thelinuxer> i just knew that his grandfather passed away
<mgamal> ah
<thelinuxer> did u need something from him ?
<mgamal> thelinuxer: he suggested several ideas from the ideas pool and his feedback would've definitely been beneficial
<thelinuxer> of course bas 7ane3mel eih zoroof
<Sensiva> tayeb what do we need for the roadmap?
<thelinuxer> here is an example from the tunisian team page
<thelinuxer> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TunisianTeam/ApprovalApplication/
<thelinuxer> we don\t need it to be that complicated
<thelinuxer> bas we have a couple of stuff
<thelinuxer> mentioned in the ideapool
<thelinuxer> we can write these
<thelinuxer> we need to agree what to write in the application
<EgyParadox> fee sample lelapplication
<thelinuxer> because we will be asked about what we did when we are asked for the reapproval
<thelinuxer> el sample 3ebara 3an title
<thelinuxer> titles*
<thelinuxer> document feeha sections
<thelinuxer> wel sections deh mawgooda fel page beta3etna
<thelinuxer> beside the ideas in the idea pool
<thelinuxer> we have other leads for events
<thelinuxer> for instance i was contacted by a community group in ain shams
<thelinuxer> for an event next month
<thelinuxer> this is in the very near future, should we include it as a part of the roadmap ?
<EgyParadox> elgroup esmo eh?
<thelinuxer> SYNC
<EgyParadox> mesh 3aref howa dah sa7bi eli 2ali 3aleh wala la2
<thelinuxer> they wanted sessions about OpenSource in general and Qt SDK
<mgamal> thelinuxer: I think it should, but provided we have volunteers ready for the event
<thelinuxer> ok cool
<thelinuxer> enta eih el a7'bar ;) ?
<thelinuxer> they just need presenters
<thelinuxer> a couple of speakers will do
<thelinuxer> Sensiva: we3nta kaman eih a7'barak ?
<EgyParadox> enta shayef elroadmap dee mesh kefaya?
<EgyParadox> elworkshop dee
<mgamal> thelinuxer: I am not available in August
<Sensiva> thelinuxer bekhsoos eh bezabt bezabt?
<thelinuxer> tedy session 3an el opensource fe ain shams
<thelinuxer> handaset ain shams
<Sensiva> no problem
<thelinuxer> EgyParadox: mesh fahmak ? a single event can't be a roadmap
<thelinuxer> cool
<EgyParadox> tayeb
<mgamal> EgyParadox: It can be a part of the roadmap
<EgyParadox> tamam
<thelinuxer> so I will add this and me and sensiva will be responsible for this event
<d4de> I think that what you really want to show is the impact of the team itself on the local Unix community. Since this team is fairly fresh and new, I suggest that you put more effort into helping more around, doing more charitable work, help the local LUG, convert more people from Windowism to Unixism, etc. A roadmap is good, it keeps your general goals clear and focused, and it should say how you are going to increase that impact upon the local community,
<d4de> how would you think you gonna increase Linux popularity in this area of the world etc..
<d4de> these are the kind of things that should be put into a roadmap
<d4de> statistics are also good to be there, maybe local surveys as well helps a lot
<thelinuxer> d4de: r u absolutely right
<thelinuxer> sorry guys brb
<osama_gma> Sorry guys, I have to leave to work on my grad project. I will check the chat log later isA ..
<osama_gma> salam
<Sensiva> salam osama_gma
<d4de> I also think that you should distribute surveys upon normal immortal users and see what turns them off from Linux/Ubuntu and try to come up with a solution or a set of suggestions and send them to the Ubuntu team
<mgamal> good luck osama_gma
<MFawzy> d4de : exactly, I think a roadmap has to be more general than just some upcoming events :)
<d4de> and make your argument based upon that Egypt is the largest consumer market in the world, so their opinion matters.
<EgyParadox> fakart ana mawdoo3 elsurveys dah bardo
<mgamal> d4de: we had a sort of a historical problem with getting feedback
<mgamal> d4de: I believe thelinuxer can elborate on that
<Sensiva> MFawzy did someone collect the reg forms and feedback forms in the last event?
<d4de> sure ... thelinuxer?
<MFawzy> ah, btw, the feedback from the CUFE summer training is with me now :) ... I got it two days ago :)
<mgamal> MFawzy: great
<Sensiva> great, can you do statistics? walla akhodhom mennak?
<Sensiva> MFawzy ^^
<MFawzy> Sensiva: 3alafekra el trainers el tanyeen kano by2olo en 2 pages for a feedback form is a bit long ;)
<MFawzy> Sensiva: sure hata5odhom :D
<d4de> Sensiva, no chi-square kind of thing, just simple population and distribution statistics that can be represented in clear simple English
<Sensiva> MFawzy el feedback form kanet single page :|
<MFawzy> Sensiva: what ? :S
<MFawzy> Sensiva: let me check :D
<Sensiva> d4de have you seen them?
<thelinuxer> back
<d4de> Guys how the feedback forms questions look like? are they multible choices, yes/no kind of questions?
<d4de> I hope they let the user represent his own thoughts in words
<Sensiva> d4de yeah, you might find their links in the mailing list
<Sensiva> yeah and empty spaces for extra info
<d4de> good
<EgyParadox> momken ne3mel outline lel7agat eli 7ane3melha felroadmap,

<EgyParadox> we b3den nekhosh fee tafaseel
<MFawzy> ah btw, Sensiva how did u send the feedback form to the CECE ??
<thelinuxer> we should do these surveys we kol 7aga
<Sensiva> MFawzy I handed them by email to thelinuxer
<MFawzy> it has problems in printing :)
<thelinuxer> bas we don't have enough man power and not enough time
<MFawzy> in what format ?
<thelinuxer> Sensiva: u sent them to the mailing list
<Sensiva> MFawzy odt
<thelinuxer> at least for now
<Sensiva> thelinuxer yeah
<MFawzy> :S Sensiva not all ppl are free as u are :D
<thelinuxer> there is a council meeting on the 20th
<MFawzy> pdf would be better for next times ;)
<thelinuxer> i want them to have a look on our application
<thelinuxer> we might be granted approval
<MFawzy> thelinuxer: hanel7a2 ?

<thelinuxer> ideas
<thelinuxer> ..etc
<Sensiva> great
<thelinuxer> for instance our friend Mohamed Darweesh
<thelinuxer> said he will prepare a standup comedy show for our next event
<thelinuxer> that's part of the roadmap
<thelinuxer> we are using art 3ashan ne publicize ubuntu
<EgyParadox> standup comedy?
<Sensiva> and I have two ideas
<thelinuxer> for instance i ask a friend to create a video ad for our group
<thelinuxer> but he didn't reply yet
<thelinuxer> dah momken yekoon bardo item fel roadmap bas ana mesh damno :)
<Sensiva> we might create two squads

<bahaa2008> Sensiva, i'm kidding with MFawzy

<thelinuxer> mgamal: don't worry

<Sensiva> mgamal in brief hanekteb fel roadmap spreading ubuntu in variety of sectors, universities, education centers and right now we are discussing who will volunteer in translating the manual
* ** ChanServ sets mode: +o Extend
<Sensiva> mgamal is disconnected already

<MFawzy> Extend: welcome :)
<thelinuxer> so we have only one resource for it now
<thelinuxer> and we will need to search for more
<thelinuxer> but it's a good point that we should put in the roadmap
<Sensiva> thelinuxer we might send a call for volunteers in the mailing list
<thelinuxer> and also we can get help from other arabic communities
<Sensiva> and FB page as well
<thelinuxer> send a call for volunteers fe kol 7etta :D

<thelinuxer> yes
<thelinuxer> i received them
<thelinuxer> and i guess everyone
<Sensiva> mgamal what was the last line?
<mgamal> but Wazery and I know some people who have been involved with P4Y
<thelinuxer> ah sorry
<mgamal> anyway
<mgamal> I believe the next step is to devise the contents for courses and contact P4Y members
<thelinuxer> P4Y = programming for youth ?
<mgamal> yes
<mgamal> we should take a closer look at the P4Y activities
<mgamal> see where we could fit in
<mgamal> devise some tangible contents
<mgamal> and then contact the P4Y people with something solid in hand
<mgamal> ??
<thelinuxer> ok
<thelinuxer> bas mesh lazem solid awi
<thelinuxer> we can try to find what they need
<thelinuxer> and try to fill that gap
<thelinuxer> bas what's more important to me now
<thelinuxer> is that u and wazery will do the communication stuff
<thelinuxer> and of course u can use the same course MFawzy will create for resala
<thelinuxer> or something similar to it
<thelinuxer> right ?
<mgamal> well
<mgamal> my idea was a more programming-oriented course
<mgamal> while using ubuntu as a dev. platform
<mgamal> but perhaps we can use the resala course contents to get the P4Y people themselves to be familiar with ubuntu
