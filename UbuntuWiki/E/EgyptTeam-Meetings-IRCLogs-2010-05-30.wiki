<thelinuxer> but i didn't get anything from him yet
<thelinuxer> jonathanhindi: eshta
<me2resh> if the portal will have many features in future, and will have continuous improvements, then i would say drupal too
<jonathanhindi> I Would Say Joomla :D
<bahaa2008> thelinuxer, i think ubuntu.com uses drupal
<EgyParadox> I suggest drupal
<thelinuxer> guys

<thelinuxer> we still have minuets till we start the meeting
<EgyParadox> sa7

<EgyParadox> etkalem asdi
<thelinuxer> ok
<thelinuxer> as u can see from the agenda i sent
<EgyParadox> I believe the meeting starts now ?
<thelinuxer> we are here to discuss what to do with our website
<thelinuxer> yes
<thelinuxer> we have a couple of decisions to make
<thelinuxer> what tools we will use to create the website ?
<thelinuxer> and what features we will include in our website ..
<thelinuxer> i suggest we start by the features so we will decide what tools to use, do u agree guys ?
<EgyParadox> tamam
<thelinuxer> just write +1 if ur vote is positive
<thelinuxer> me2resh: bahaa2008 we started the meeting where r u guys ?
<Anas> so sorry
<Anas> i am forget
<EgyParadox> 6 mins?
<thelinuxer> Anas: no np
<me2resh> i am here
<thelinuxer> we are @ the beginning
<me2resh> following :)
<bahaa2008> thelinuxer, sorry i will not attend :(
<thelinuxer> bahaa2008: :( why man ?
<EgyParadox> I believe we have to be unique in our features.
<bahaa2008> thelinuxer, i have exams withing two days
<thelinuxer> bahaa2008: Rabena ma3ak
<thelinuxer> ok we will proceed
<thelinuxer> EgyParadox: define unique ?
<EgyParadox> I mean different
<thelinuxer> ok, i guess the functionality is what really matter
<thelinuxer> and the content
<thelinuxer> for instant we can create a blog
<EgyParadox> ok.
<thelinuxer> and we don't get enough blog posts
<Anas> i think we are active more than any linux distro in egypt todays
<thelinuxer> so it will be useless
<EgyParadox> then
<EgyParadox> ?
<thelinuxer> Anas: u mean linux groups ?
<Anas> yep
<Anas> some people call me for our group support others
<Anas> :)
<thelinuxer> Anas: did u check the agenda https://wiki.ubuntu.com/EgyptTeam/Meetings/Agendas/2010-05-30 ?
<Anas> ok
<thelinuxer> please lets focus
<thelinuxer> here are the basic list of features:
<thelinuxer> Blogging for our team members.
<thelinuxer> Aggregator for our list of contributors.
<thelinuxer> Video portal
<thelinuxer> Wiki
<thelinuxer> Forums.
<thelinuxer> in the first point we expect to have a certain no. of bloggers who will post constantly on our website
<thelinuxer> it's also expected to have these posts in arabic and/or english
<Anas> good
<Anas> about wiki we need what about ubuntu wiki
<thelinuxer> so what we basically need is a couple of bloggers and may be a translator for this part to work properly
<thelinuxer> wiki is the last point and we are in the first point ya man :)
<EgyParadox> I cant really understand can you elaborate more about the first point.
<EgyParadox> ?
<thelinuxer> simply it will something like blogspot or wordpress but for our team only
<me2resh> I got lost here, we are talking about the tools, or the resources that will blog ?
<Anas> blogging wordpress mu or buddypress to make multi-blogs
<thelinuxer> me2resh: no i talking about it as a feature
<thelinuxer> me2resh: for instance we can decide to remove it all together
<thelinuxer> does anyone understand what i am trying to say ?
<me2resh> well, if this is for the team only, then we can use the regular wordpress, no need for the mu
<thelinuxer> i guess i am u all lost ta2reban :D
<Anas> great
<Anas> keep it simple
<thelinuxer> what's mu ?
<me2resh> wordpress multiuser
<thelinuxer> ok np
<Anas> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Udienz/WordpressUbuntuTheme
<thelinuxer> but i have a concern here
<Anas> what ?
<thelinuxer> who is willing to contribute ..
<thelinuxer> we have a lot of blogs that are empty
<Anas> i can play css good
<Anas> any help with theme i am here
<EgyParadox> I personally dont prefer wordpress
<Anas> magie can blogging good in english
<Anas> but
<Anas> i am bad in english
<Anas> i can blogging in arabic good
<Anas> :D
<thelinuxer> guys i am not talking about the technologies, i said we are discussing the features first., to choose the tool later
<EgyParadox> tamam
<me2resh> I can blog on fixing popular issues in new distors, that's what brings the traffic to my blog :)
<thelinuxer> i guess u all agree about having a blog, that's y ur skipping to the technology choice
<thelinuxer> me2resh: cool
<EgyParadox> I agree for a blog
<thelinuxer> can u do it multilingual :D ?
<EgyParadox> after that we can host our own website
<EgyParadox> in the future
<thelinuxer> me2resh: can u do it multilingual :D ?
<me2resh> thelinuxer, am not that good in translation
<thelinuxer> ok
<thelinuxer> so we have a contributor
<thelinuxer> and Anas also
<Anas> thelinuxer : you mean multi-lang blog ?
<thelinuxer> will contribute to the arabic section
<thelinuxer> Anas: yes
<Anas> great
<thelinuxer> people in our community are comfortable blogging in eglish
<thelinuxer> but we are the loco team we have to have content in our mother language
<Anas> in simple in wordpress we can create catogrey in arabic lang simply
<Anas> i am agree with you
<EgyParadox> I believe we can put some kind of link that would automatically translate to Arabic using google translate
<Anas> we ara arabic talk to arabic
<thelinuxer> exactly
<Anas> what ? google translation ?
<Anas> nooooooooo
<Anas> it automatic translation
<EgyParadox> Anas you are right
<Anas> :(
<me2resh> we can have both,
<Anas> anyone can translate it by google toolbar
<thelinuxer> what if they don't have that bar ?
<me2resh> we can have that tool to translate to any language for articles that doesn't have any translation
<Anas> but we should write another posts in arabic for arab and another posts in english for others people
<thelinuxer> it would be really cool if we use the translator to our benefit for the untranslated posts
<Anas> it diffrent goals of blogging
<thelinuxer> Anas: the content will be there to help our community
<thelinuxer> they are the same people
<Anas> ok
<thelinuxer> but everyone will read the english post
<thelinuxer> posts*
<thelinuxer> so we will need both
<Anas> can i write in arabic plz
<Anas> ?
<Anas> to explain my idea ?
<thelinuxer> Anas: sure
<me2resh> and maybe the content attracts other people that neither speak arabic or english :)
<EgyParadox> I believe posts in arabic is a must,
<EgyParadox> must.*
<Anas> انا قصدي العربي بيخاطب العرب بمحتوي مختلف عن المدونة الانجليش اللي بتخاطب الناس الاجانب
<Anas> تدوينة عربية بكلم فيها للناس العرب مش بترجم التدوينة الانجليش
<Anas> الوضع مختلف
<thelinuxer> Anas: the english blog also is talking to the egyptian community that can speak english
<Anas> مش مدونة واحدة مترجمة لكذا لغة
<Anas> لا موقع بمحتوي مختلف في كل لغة العربي و الانجليزي
<thelinuxer> Anas: man we need know the purpose of this blog
<thelinuxer> we need to have good content to support the egyptian users
<Anas> talk to people
<thelinuxer> so we will support them with the languages they speak
<Anas> good
<thelinuxer> arabic or english
<me2resh> also there is non arabic speaking people in Egypt that interested and looking for support from the community
<Anas> good
<Anas> i am agree with you
<thelinuxer> that's y the content can be translated
<thelinuxer> me2resh: hmm i guess ur right about that
<Anas> how much people ? non arabic speaking people in Egypt ???? 1%
<thelinuxer> i totally forgot about these people
<Anas> we have our main page in ubuntu loco team in english for them
<thelinuxer> so lets get organized
<thelinuxer> cause translation is an issue as i can see
<thelinuxer> we have anas who is willing to write in arabic
<thelinuxer> and me2resh who is willing to write in english
<thelinuxer> that's a beginning
<thelinuxer> when we get to the content part we can argue whether we translate it or not
<thelinuxer> agree guys ?
<EgyParadox> mashy
<EgyParadox> wa7da wa7da
<me2resh> yep
<thelinuxer> 3/4
<thelinuxer> cool 2nd point 3ashan heya related lel first
<thelinuxer> we were thinking having an aggregator too
<thelinuxer> 3ashan nelem from people who have blogs outside our website
<EgyParadox> mashy
<thelinuxer> i guess that will be more convenient to these users
<thelinuxer> anyone have any objects ?
<thelinuxer> objections*
<EgyParadox> la2
<me2resh> mo
<me2resh> no*
<thelinuxer> ok so for the technology choice
<thelinuxer> i suggest we use drupal
<thelinuxer> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDrupal
<EgyParadox> ok with drupal
<thelinuxer> https://edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu-drupal-theme
<thelinuxer> please check the themes/modules section in this page https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDrupal
<EgyParadox> http://drupal.org/project/udtheme-2010/
<thelinuxer> so we will have tight integration with launchpad which is a good thing
<thelinuxer> and a blogging engine + an aggregator
<Anas> what it aggregator ?
<thelinuxer> all that out of the box
<Anas> rss aggregator ? feed reader ?
<thelinuxer> a website that collects posts from other blogs
<me2resh> agree
<Anas> automatic ?
<EgyParadox> tamam
<thelinuxer> Anas: it doesn't have to be a website sorry
<EgyParadox> I believe nobody would object.
<thelinuxer> Anas: i am not sure automatic or not
<thelinuxer> ok gr8
<thelinuxer> so we now have the basic website
<Anas> i can't understand this feature good
<thelinuxer> Anas: do u agree with us ?
<Anas> ok
<Anas> go
<Anas> i found alote of arabic and sites and blogs support ubuntu
<Anas> agree
<thelinuxer> http://planet.gnome.org/
<thelinuxer> check this out
<Anas> aha
<thelinuxer> it collects others posts from different places, and place them in one single website
<Anas> like planet inkscape :D understand it now
<Anas> :D
<thelinuxer> belzabt
<Anas> good idea
<thelinuxer> ok lets move on
<Anas> great one
<Anas> ok
<thelinuxer> video portal
<thelinuxer> this my own personal favorite
<Anas> youtube
<Anas> vimo ?
<me2resh> we can use vimeo and integrate it with drupal
<thelinuxer> wait
<Anas> i think use web 2.0 sites
<Anas> ok
<thelinuxer> Anas: yabny belra7a howa ana 2olt eih el fekra!
<thelinuxer> :D
<Anas> sorry
<thelinuxer> here is what i was thinking about
<thelinuxer> about creating a classroom
<EgyParadox> elearning?
<thelinuxer> classrooms means curriculums
<EgyParadox> oh ok.
<EgyParadox> in what language?
<m1nour> SA, sorry for being late, faced a prb with java
<thelinuxer> means that someone can and will watch a certain about of related videos in sequence
<thelinuxer> m1nour: np
<EgyParadox> egyptian/arabic/english ?
<thelinuxer> guys can u please let me finish before u ask questions ?!
<Anas> what the point ?
<Anas> ok
<EgyParadox> ok.
<thelinuxer> if anyone saw CBT nuggets CDs before
<me2resh> yes
<thelinuxer> they are a list of files
<thelinuxer> with a certain content, designed to teach the student something
<thelinuxer> not just random videos
<Anas> great
<thelinuxer> also they can be watched in sequence
<thelinuxer> check this site out
<thelinuxer> http://alephtv.com/
<me2resh> small how tos ?
<thelinuxer> me2resh: yes
<me2resh> iLike :)
<thelinuxer> this is a site we developed back @ opencraft
<thelinuxer> me2resh: thanx, i was the team leader for that project :D
<thelinuxer> i want it to be like this list of videos
<Anas> wow
<Anas> i loved it
<thelinuxer> the student will search for a curriculum
<thelinuxer> and we will get him a list designed for this specific purpose
<thelinuxer> Anas: thanx man
<me2resh> thelinuxer, good :), we have a new member in the team from oc :)
<thelinuxer> were u from oc too ?
<Anas> it load video from youtube
<me2resh> thelinuxer, no, but a new member joined our team in my work is from oc, that's what i meant
<thelinuxer> ah, what's his name ?
<thelinuxer> i will continue
<me2resh> thelinuxer, Zeww
<thelinuxer> me2resh: oba! zeww !
<thelinuxer> enta sha3'al feen ?
<me2resh> thelinuxer, GCS
<thelinuxer> eshta ya me3lam
<thelinuxer> we will talk about this later :)
<me2resh> thelinuxer, sure :)
<Anas> ....
<thelinuxer> the first point i thught about was creating a collaborative channel on youtube
<Anas> great
<thelinuxer> but found out that such thing does not exist
<Anas> but youtube or vimpo ?
<thelinuxer> so if we created a channel on youtube someone will have to upload all the videos
<me2resh> youtube has the 10 minutes limit, if we stick to small howtos then it is good choice, but if we will have large tutorials, we have to consider an alternative
<me2resh> http://vimeo.com/
<thelinuxer> me2resh: ur right about that
<Anas> great
<thelinuxer> yes i know vimeo and it has a limit on the upload, am i righ ?
<me2resh> thelinuxer, not sure how much, 1 sec i am checking
<thelinuxer> ok
<thelinuxer> tab i will continue talking till me2resh comes back
<thelinuxer> so here is the complete idea
<thelinuxer> we need to integrate with our backend video site
<thelinuxer> it can be anything
<thelinuxer> users will be able to upload their videos on their websites and then add a link to it in some curriculum
<me2resh> � 500MB per week of upload space
<me2resh> � 1 HD video per week
<me2resh> � Upload up to 10 videos per day
<me2resh> � 1 Channel, 1 Group, and 3 Albums
<me2resh> � Ability to download converted files
<me2resh> � Robust privacy controls
<me2resh> � Basic embedding features
<me2resh> � Huge street cred
<thelinuxer> hmm
<me2resh> that's the free account
<thelinuxer> yeah i know
<thelinuxer> anyway lets postpone the video backend site for later
<thelinuxer> mins we nerga3
<thelinuxer> http://drupal.org/project/mediafront
<thelinuxer> this a drupal plugin that provides us with an interface similar to alephtv.com
<thelinuxer> with the capability to play playlists and stuff like that
<thelinuxer> has anyone tried it before ?
<me2resh> no
<thelinuxer> i they say they have integration with youtube
<thelinuxer> http://www.mediafront.org/
<thelinuxer> mesh 3aref feeh vimeo wala la2
<thelinuxer> so to sum up
<thelinuxer> we have the option of creating a collaborative channel on a video site like vimeo
<thelinuxer> but I don't know what kind of integration will be provided with our site
<thelinuxer> second
<thelinuxer> we can use something like mediafront to play playlists that we will create
<thelinuxer> and call them curriculum
<thelinuxer> we can have stuff like recommendations and such
<thelinuxer> so what do think guys ?
<me2resh> check this http://drupal.org/node/208963 :)
<me2resh> comment #11
<thelinuxer> so vimeo is supported that's gr8
<thelinuxer> gr8
<thelinuxer> i guess the integration here means that we will be able to play these files in a playlist
<thelinuxer> using mediafront
<thelinuxer> bas what can we do with this ?
<thelinuxer> can we do recommendations ?
<thelinuxer> staff picks we el kalam el fayd dah :D
<thelinuxer> how will we moderate the stuff uploaded ...
<me2resh> the developer who will volunteer in this is to decide :)
<me2resh> and we still can start with the basics
<thelinuxer> does vimeo have this feature ?
<me2resh> you will let the public upload ?
<thelinuxer> yes sure
<thelinuxer> yes that's the purpose
<thelinuxer> make people contribute
<thelinuxer> it just have to be moderated
<me2resh> i dont think so, beside i don't think it is a feature in youtube as well
<thelinuxer> what r u talking about ?
<me2resh> moderation
<me2resh> to moderate videos that the public will upload
<thelinuxer> hmm
<thelinuxer> expected
<thelinuxer> they can't moderate all these videos anyway
<thelinuxer> they depend on the collective work we keda
<thelinuxer> tayeb
<thelinuxer> i just created the ubuntu-eg channel on vimeo
<thelinuxer> and i want to add u to be an uploader to that channel
<thelinuxer> how can i do that ?
<me2resh> thelinuxer, didn't try before
<thelinuxer> ok np
<thelinuxer> i will try that later
<thelinuxer> anyway if we can get collaborative channels on vimeo most of the work is done
<thelinuxer> and we can post a notification on the website that a new video is uploaded
<thelinuxer> i guess that the basic features we needs
<thelinuxer> need*
<me2resh> We found 0 channels with 'ubuntu-eg'. Start over?
<thelinuxer> lol
<thelinuxer> go that too!
<thelinuxer> may be i need to upload some videos
<thelinuxer> http://vimeo.com/channels/110502
<me2resh> http://vimeo.com/channels/guiaubuntu
<me2resh> thelinuxer, i subscribed, may be you can op me to a moderator / uploader now
<thelinuxer> le tme try
<thelinuxer> ur name please on vimeo
<me2resh> me2resh
<thelinuxer> can't find u!
<Anas> great channel
<The-NightPhoenix> hey guys
<The-NightPhoenix> r u still here
<thelinuxer> found u
<The-NightPhoenix> im back
<The-NightPhoenix> sorry
<thelinuxer> me2resh: ur a moderator now
<thelinuxer> i guess that solves a gr8 part of the problem
<me2resh> good :)
<thelinuxer> Anas: u'll do the theme for the channel isA :D
<Anas> what
<Anas> it by css ?
<Anas> or what ?
<Anas> or just background ؟
<Anas> :D
<thelinuxer> mesh 3aref
<thelinuxer> bas u'll do it
<thelinuxer> i am taking advantage of u
<Anas> :)
<thelinuxer> The-NightPhoenix: welcome np
<Anas> Ok
<Anas> i know i can do it
<thelinuxer> eshta so this point is settled el 7amdulelah
<Anas> i will test it in my channel there
<thelinuxer> next 2 points i will combine them into a single point
<thelinuxer> Anas: eshta
<thelinuxer> send me ur contact name to add u as a moderator
<thelinuxer> lets continue
<thelinuxer> wiki+forums
<thelinuxer> that's really one of the easiest thing to do with drupal
<thelinuxer> bas i am having an issue with doing this
<thelinuxer> we already have a wiki and a forum
<thelinuxer> so we will have to move all our users to the new pages
<thelinuxer> and maintain these parts of the website, backups masalan
<thelinuxer> from the other side
<Anas> user3564436
<me2resh> why do we need to redo this ?
<thelinuxer> it's a lot better for our user to have all of our data in the same website
<thelinuxer> including wiki and forums so s/he doesn't have to search somewhere else
<thelinuxer> me2resh: that's what i am saying
<Anas> about search
<thelinuxer> do we need to do it or not
<Anas> i have idea
<Anas> google custome search
<Anas> in our site and blogs and wiki
<Anas> :)
<Anas> and another arabic ubuntu blogs and english
<thelinuxer> Anas: mesh fahem 7aga
<maggie> sorry guys am late just arrived home :(
<thelinuxer> and i can't find ur user on vimeo
<thelinuxer> maggie: bad bad maggie
<Anas> http://www.google.com/cse/
<thelinuxer> Anas: ya man focus
<maggie> the linuxer : :(
<thelinuxer> how is that related to what we are talking about ?
<thelinuxer> maggie: we are discussing whether we should have the wiki and forums on our website or not
<thelinuxer> and nobody is answering me :D
<Anas> http://vimeo.com/people/search:Anas%20Emad
<thelinuxer> Anas: added u to the list
<EgyParadox> I missed quite a big part
<me2resh> thelinuxer, why not use the existing ones, until there is a need to move it all together ?
<EgyParadox> I cant help.
<jonathanhindi> Hello !
<thelinuxer> convenience. that's all what we gonna gain
<thelinuxer> convenience for our users i mean
<maggie> <jonathanhindi> hello Jonathan
<thelinuxer> jonathanhindi: wb
<jonathanhindi> Thanks
<thelinuxer> and setting up the a wiki on drupal isn't a big deal
<thelinuxer> and also a forum
<EgyParadox> We wont talk about the content of the videos?
<thelinuxer> drupal is mde for these kind of things
<thelinuxer> EgyParadox: no we won't
<EgyParadox> ok.
<EgyParadox> is there something else?
<thelinuxer> that's pretty much personal, whatever u find suitable create a video and upload it
<EgyParadox> what about ideas for videos?
<thelinuxer> we can always have peer review
<thelinuxer> we are past this point now
<thelinuxer> we are discussing the wiki and forums
<EgyParadox> ok.
<Anas> ok
<jonathanhindi> Can i Know What You Decided On !?
<thelinuxer> should we move from the existing forums and wiki or not ?
<thelinuxer> please vote
<Anas> i think forums and wiki in ubuntu web site is good
<EgyParadox> I believe that too
<Anas> note
<The-NightPhoenix> i think moving them is more convenient
<Anas> not now
<Anas> we just start
<EgyParadox> I believe when we are independant we can do that.
<jonathanhindi> Me 2 i think ubuntu Wiki And Forums Stile Very Good
<thelinuxer> sorry ur getting me confused
<Anas> but in arabic content is it good ?
<thelinuxer> just say move or not
<maggie> I say not
<EgyParadox> not
<jonathanhindi> Yes We Are not independent to move from the ubuntu website
<thelinuxer> tell u what i need a 10 min break
<jonathanhindi> not
<thelinuxer> i have to go pray
<Anas> not
<me2resh> not (until we have to)
<Anas> ok me too
<The-NightPhoenix> thelinuxer : me 2
<EgyParadox> We can still use them , but when we need them.
<EgyParadox> We need them now.
<jonathanhindi> EgyParadox : I Think We Need To Use Them as or master Forums and Wiki !
<jonathanhindi> our **
<EgyParadox> I believe it
<EgyParadox> I believe it's hard to decide now, but now we should still use the forums and wiki.
<EgyParadox> We cannot decide now, so must use it , we have no other option.
<EgyParadox> simply as that.
<EgyParadox> We are still in the beginning, we cannot be come entirely independent.
<EgyParadox> become*
<The-NightPhoenix> bk
<jonathanhindi> Welcome Back
<Anas> back
<jonathanhindi> Anas: Welcome Back
<thelinuxer> i m back
<EgyParadox> I totally refuse moving from our original wiki page.
<thelinuxer> ok so i guess the majority is against having our own wiki and forums
<EgyParadox> we dont need to.
<thelinuxer> EgyParadox: ok
<thelinuxer> that was the last point in our agenda
<thelinuxer> i will try to sum up the points
<jonathanhindi> Yes Please !
<thelinuxer> we agreed to have a drupal installation
<thelinuxer> members of our team can have a blog on our website
<thelinuxer> Anas will do some arabic blogging for us
<thelinuxer> while me2resh volunteered for the english section
<thelinuxer> and of course we expect more to come
<thelinuxer> We also agreed to have an aggregator
<thelinuxer> so we will have our own planet
<thelinuxer> As for the video poral
<EgyParadox> tamam
<thelinuxer> we created a collaborative channel on vimeo
<thelinuxer> people can be added to this channel
<jonathanhindi> Fine Awey
<The-NightPhoenix> good
<thelinuxer> so we can all build the channel collaboratively
<thelinuxer> for now
<thelinuxer> the only integration we will have with our website is a post in the news feed
<thelinuxer> when someone uploads a video we will notify the community that's it, at least for now ..
<thelinuxer> You all disagreed to moving the current wiki and forums
<thelinuxer> that's it ..
<maggie> great
<thelinuxer> we will have help from this page https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDrupal

<thelinuxer> EgyParadox: yes that's it
<thelinuxer> so i guess i am the only one with actions items
<thelinuxer> 1. Create basic drupal installation
<thelinuxer> 2. Use the new theme
<thelinuxer> 3. Deploy
<thelinuxer> 4. Ask the council to the change the ip for ubuntu-eg.org to the new ip
<thelinuxer> 5. Check vimeo channels and their capabilities
<thelinuxer> can someone else do the last point ?
<thelinuxer> guys where did u all go :D ?!
<The-NightPhoenix> lol
<me2resh> :D ismael
<thelinuxer> ismael?
<m1nour> i didn't get the last point
<thelinuxer> Check vimeo channels and their capabilities
<thelinuxer> we don't know what can we do with them
<thelinuxer> we now know that we can add multiple uploaders
<thelinuxer> do they all have to be moderators ? this a question that we need to answer
<thelinuxer> can we allow anyone to add ?
<thelinuxer> the 500 MB/week limit, is it per channel or per user ?
<thelinuxer> ..etc
<EgyParadox> I personally just created an account on vimeo.
<thelinuxer> EgyParadox: good
<EgyParadox> So I don't know about it much.
<thelinuxer> EgyParadox: u can always read to know more :D
<m1nour> ok, someone who don't have exams :D
<m1nour> *doesn't
<thelinuxer> i guess no one wants to volunteer for the point, np
<The-NightPhoenix> i dont even have an acoount on vimeo yet
<EgyParadox> I believe we can start implementing when we are free.
<EgyParadox> or at least who are free can start something.
<EgyParadox> since everybody has exams
<thelinuxer> i guess we can have this site up and running by the end of the week
<thelinuxer> and that's because i don't have much time
<thelinuxer> there are people who will finish their exams by mid june isA
<thelinuxer> and others after that
<thelinuxer> bas i still have to communicate with council
<thelinuxer> and request the change
<thelinuxer> that will need time
<jonathanhindi> ok
<EgyParadox> I personally have internship issues.
<EgyParadox> I am busy.
<jonathanhindi> so ahmed i will not change the logo before the end of my exams so am sorry
<EgyParadox> and other personal issues.
<thelinuxer> ok np i will do that
<thelinuxer> and u can change it later if we need to
<EgyParadox> we still have an entire summer.
<jonathanhindi> Ok !! I Have to go Now Sorry byebye
<thelinuxer> or i will just leave the original logo till u finish ur exams
<thelinuxer> jonathanhindi: ok bye
<thelinuxer> i guess we discussed all the points
