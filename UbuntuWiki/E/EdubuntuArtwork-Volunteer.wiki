'''Comments'''
* Nice for older students, high school, etc.  (sbalneav)
* I agree with sbalneav, this works for a pretty wide range of students. (LaserJock)
* Let's tidy this one up and make it the default desktop we ship with Gutsy (RichEd)
* Agreed (ogra)

'''Suggested edits'''
* The Edubuntu logo should be more in the background though. (LaserJock)
* More transparent I guess. (LaserJock)
* We need it at 1600x1200 for the final version, sp that it scales down to all sizes (ogra)
* Perhaps the gradients could be different/shorter and the colors used more homogenous. It seems that there are several different yellows used because some items are over-layed in white (I guess). <nowiki>[[KennethWimer]]</nowiki> <<DateTime>>

* revised version: '''Edubuntu_global-sept307b.png'''

'''Comments'''
* Perhaps the English text could be substituted for something like Latin or (ancient) Greek. (at the risk of upsetting people, any other "Dead" language :)). I was thinking this because a number of places arn't particularly fond of English speaking cultures.

'''Suggested edits'''
* '''done:''' the logo needs to move up a bit (it's covered by the panel)
** '''done:''' and half the space between the logo and the right side would make it look better
** '''done:''' (move it to the right 50%)
** beyond that i'd take it as is :)

'''Suggested edits'''
* I guess I'd like to have it a bit more faded/transparent (LaserJock)

'''Comments'''
* I like this one quite a bit too. Only thing is the straight part on the right. It creates an alignment element with my icons that's kinda weird. The spirals work better. (LaserJock)

'''Comments from the community members at the edubuntu weekly meeting.'''
* Looks great ... especially for a first attempt !
* Would do well as an optional wallpaper, for younger users to select.
* The default desktop is usually more abstract, and less defined
** The reason for this is to keep it less busy and not to distract the eye from easily identifying icons on the desktop.

'''Suggested edits:'''
* Jill, Can you reduce the impact of the Edubuntu wording and logo (ogra)
