__TOC__

The purpose of this team is to build a community of teachers, educational technologists, and anyone else interested in the educational applications of open source technology. To be successful in this, we need people of all talents - from those who can develop and improve software packages to those who can create and implement teaching plans and activities.

Our first project is to develop a collection of lessons designed around using open source software in the classroom. Please visit the <nowiki>[[Lessons|Lessons]]</nowiki> wiki to learn more or add content.

We are open to other ideas as well. Please share any you have.
