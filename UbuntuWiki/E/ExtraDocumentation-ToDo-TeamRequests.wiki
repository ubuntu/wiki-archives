This page is our team's frontpage, and therefore where visitors will most likely first come to learn about our team. Thus, it is important that there are no errors on our page that could turn visitors away. Also, it helps the general coherence of the wiki and Ubuntu as a whole, since our team provides a quite important service to Ubuntu.

The Extra Documentation Team is important to Ubuntu as a whole because we provide general writing, research, and maintenance services for the general data and documentation of Ubuntu. Our team mainly does work on outdated or badly written documentation, but sometimes does work (upon request) for teams and other important aspects of Ubuntu.

The <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ExtraDocumentation|Wiki:ExtraDocumentation|target="_blank"]]</nowiki> page describes the Extra Documentation Team and explains the work we do. It also provides links to other related pages.
