== Edubuntu CD Shipping Plans ==

'''As mentioned in <nowiki>[[EdubuntuCDPrintingPlans]]</nowiki> we are planning a run of 8,000 Limited edition Edubuntu 5.10 CD's.'''

These will be distributed to our main Edubuntu Community Advocates/Evangelists around the world for them to distribute through events and various other channels in their respective communities. They will be able to represent Edubuntu in these communities and provide a support hub.

* As these CDs are VERY limited we will use 3 main criteria to prioritise.
  1. Merit. We will favour those that have been involved with and contributing to the project.
  2. Good Shiping Plans proposals. The more thorough and worthy your plans of getting the CDs out there and put to good use the better. i.e. it will help if you scheduled to be speaking at a big event and will be talking about and demonstrating Edubuntu. Also if your plans include converting all schools in your 100km radious to Edubuntu, that is good too! ;)
  3. First come first served, get your plan in quickly, because once the CDs are gone, they are gone - doesn't matter how good your plan or how hard you worked... 
* Where there is more than one strong community member per country please liaise with each other and decide who will be the principle contact, you can divide the shipment up amoungst yourselves thereafter.

 The rules are:
** We will Ship no more than 500 to any given country. 
** We must document the shipping plan, below.
** We must document the distribution plans (per shipment), below 
** I am not certin who will cover the shiping costs, but I will try to arrange that Canonical picks this up. It is not impossible that it will have to be COD though.

''Please note that this funding has been given to us as it is believed it is a worth while investment to grow and further Edubuntu. We need to maximise this opportunity and get good results with it. Further funding and support depends on it. Let's make it awesome!''

* We are already starting to set regular ''10 guests demo sessions'' with Teachers and Students (from elementary schools to universities), on separate schedules.
* Also, we'll try to organize a sort of ''Free Technology Fairs'', with a special area for Education Technologies. In such fairs, Teachers and Students (who have already used and approved Edubuntu) will be the voices of our ''success stories'' in front of the public. Each person we invite will be part of a database that we'll use for later purposes (i.e. keeping track of their experiences with Edubuntu).
