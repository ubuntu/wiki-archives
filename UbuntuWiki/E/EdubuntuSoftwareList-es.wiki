=== tuxpaint ===
* Description: A paint program for young children

Tux Paint is meant to be a simple drawing program for young children.  It is not meant as a general-purpose drawing tool.
It IS meant to be fun and easy to use.  Sound effects and a cartoon character help let the user know what's going on, and keeps them entertained.

Tux Paint is extensible.  Brushes and "rubber stamp" shapes can be dropped in and pulled out.  For example, a teacher can drop in a collection of animal shapes and ask their students to draw an ecosystem.  Each shape can have a sound which is played, and textual facts which are displayed, when the child selects the shape.

There is no direct access to the computer's underlying intricacies. The current image is kept when the program quits, and reappears when it is restarted.  Saving images requires no need to create filenames or use the keyboard.  Opening an image is done by selecting it from a collection of thumbnails.

You can visualise the Periodic Table of the Elements by blocks, groups, acidic behavior or different states of matter.  You can also plot data for a range of elements (weight, mean weight, density, IE1, IE2, electronegativity), and you can go back in time to see what elements were known at a given date.

* Description: vocabulary trainer for KDE

`KVoc`Train is a little utility to help you train your vocabulary when you are trying to learn a foreign language.  You can create your own database with the words you need.  It is intended as a replacement for index (flash) cards.

You probably remember flashcards from school.  The teacher would write the original expression on the front side of the card and the translation on the back.  Then look at the cards one after another.  If you knew the translation, you could put it away.  If you failed, you put it back to try again.

`KVoc`Train is not intended to teach you grammar or other sophisticated things.  This is and probably will stay beyond the scope of this application.

=== kturtle ===
* Description: educational Logo programming environment

KTurtle is an educational programming environment using the Logo programming language.  It tries to make programming as easy and accessible as possible.  This makes KTurtle suitable for teaching kids the basics of mathematics, geometry and programming.

The commands used to program are in the style of the Logo programming language.  The unique feature of Logo is that the commands are often translated into the speaking language of the programmer.

KTurtle is named after "the turtle" that plays a central role in the programming environment.  The user programs the turtle, using the Logo commands, to draw a picture on the canvas.

Note that this version of Logo is only focused on the educational qualities of the programming language and will not try to suit professional programmers' needs.

* to serve as a WYSIWYG tool for drawing mathematical figures and including them in other documents.

With this program you can do geometry on a computer just like you would on a blackboard in a classroom.  However, the program allows you to move and change parts of a geometrical drawing so that you can see how the other parts change as a result.

Kig supports loci and user-defined macros.  It also supports imports and exports to/from foreign file formats including Cabri, Dr. Geo, KGeo, KSeg and XFig.

=== scribus ===
* Description: Open Source Desktop Publishing

Scribus is an open source desktop page layout program with the aim of producing commercial grade output in PDF and Postscript, primarily, though not exclusively for Linux.

Scribus can be used for many tasks; from brochure design to newspapers, magazines, newsletters and posters to technical documentation. It has sophisticated page layout features like precision placing and rotating of text and/or images on a page, manual kerning of type, bezier curves polygons, precision placement of objects, layering with RGB and CMYK custom colors. The Scribus document file format is XML-based. Unlike proprietary binary file formats, even damaged documents, can be recovered with a simple text editor.

Scribus supports professional DTP features, such as CMYK color and a color management system to soft proof images for high quality color printing, flexible PDF creation options, Encapsulated PostScript import/export and creation of 4 color separations, import of EPS/PS and SVG as native vector graphics, Unicode text including right to left scripts such as Arabic and Hebrew via freetype. Graphic formats which can be placed in Scribus as images include PDF, Encapsulated Post Script (eps), TIFF, JPEG, PNG and XPixMap(xpm), and any bitmap type supported by QT3.

Printing, PDF and SVG creation are done via custom driver libraries and plug-ins, giving Scribus inventive features: the abilities to include presentation effects with PDF output, fully scriptable interactive PDF forms, SVG vector file output. The internal printer drivers fully support Level 2 and Level 3/PDF 1.4 postscript features including transparency and
font embedding.

When run from KDE, Drag and Drop, for example from desktop to the canvas, is enabled. There is easy to use drag and drop scrapbook for frequently used items such as text blocks, pictures and custom shaped frames.

=== schooltool ===
* Description: common platform for school administration

SchoolTool is an open source school management information system.  It is a distributed client/server system.  The SchoolTool server presents two interfaces to clients:

* a traditional web application interface, usable with an ordinary browser.

* HTTP-based programming interface suitable for fat clients, adhering to the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style (see http://rest.blueoxen.net/).

The web application interface is the primary one.  The RESTive interface is there for potential interoperability with other systems and fat clients to perform data entry that is inconvenient to do via the web application interface.

Any modern web browser is suitable for the web application interface.  The interface degrades gracefully, so a browser that does not support CSS or Javascript will be usable, although perhaps not very nice or convenient.

This package is a configuration package which sets up a standard stand alone server.

** pythoncard -- Available in the Python Programming section of Universe (see note #1)
** pygame -- Available in the Python Programming section of Universe

Note #1: In order to run pythoncard one MUST remove the libwxgtk2.4-python package or pythoncard will FAIL to start. I (Colin) tried hacking the pythoncard source to select the wxPython version (2.5.8.3) over the 2.4.2.4 wxPython libraries with no success. Pythoncard still failed to start.
** Remove the libwxgtk2.4-python package for an Edubuntu install? 

=== K12LTSP Software ===

I thought it might be a good idea to incorporate what's already in K12LTSP (more or less in order of importance):

* Ggradebook (couldn't find ubuntu package)

=== Wikipedia ===
Maybe by adding a Static Wikipedia version it would help Schools that don't have Internet Access.
I know of a Static Version that is about 380 MB Compressed.

Will update this section shortly...
