== Introduction ==
The Ubuntu developers are moving very quickly to bring you the absolute latest and greatest software the Open Source Community has to offer. The Edgy Eft Beta is the first beta release of Ubuntu 6.10, and with this new beta release comes a whole host of excellent new features. Improvements have been made all around such as faster system boot up times, faster GNOME start up times, improvements to the user interface, a shiny new optimized kernel, GNOME 2.16, and much, much more.

'''Note: This is a beta-quality pre-release of Ubuntu 6.10. Do not install it on production machines. The final stable version will be released later in October 2006.'''

== Installation ==

Get it while it's hot. CD images for installation and live demonstration are available for direct download and BitTorrent.  A list of mirrors can be found on EdgyBetaAnnouncement.

== Upgrade from 6.06 LTS ==

If you want to upgrade from 6.06 LTS to 6.10, run the following command (either via ALT-F2 or a terminal):
<pre>
gksu "update-manager -c -d"
</pre>

The "-d" switch instructs Update Manager to consider pre-release versions, including this Beta release. Without this switch, only official, final releases will be considered. The "-c" switch tells it to look for upgrades at all. By default the 6.06 LTS release will not offer that automatically because of its long support cycle and high stability.

If you have a working network connection, it should then inform you about a new release and offer to upgrade your system. 

== Known issues ==

There are some known issues on the beta CD which will be fixed before the final release. Those are:

* The desktop CD always uses a US (QWERTY) keyboard layout by default, but this can be changed via preferences or by running the installer (<nowiki>[[http://launchpad.net/bugs/61050|#61050]]</nowiki>).
* On certain platforms with 64-bit CPUs and NVIDIA graphics, the graphical boot screen does not function and a blank screen is displayed.  The solution is to wait patiently for the login screen to appear (<nowiki>[[http://launchpad.net/bugs/56587|#56587]]</nowiki>).
* Applications using the Mono subsystem (including F-Spot and Tomboy) fail to launch from the desktop CD, but will work fine once the system has been installed (<nowiki>[[http://launchpad.net/bugs/62756|#62756]]</nowiki>)
* On the alternate CD install the new apt auto-install information is wrong. Remove "/var/lib/apt/extended_states" on the freshly installed system as a workaround (<nowiki>[[http://launchpad.net/bugs/61684|#61684]]</nowiki>).
* No Edubuntu 64-bit installation CD is available (<nowiki>[[http://launchpad.net/bugs/62750|#62750]]</nowiki>)

== Upstart - init redone ==

{{https://wiki.ubuntu.com/EdgyEft/Knot3?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=upstart.png}} The new init system, upstart, has now been turned on by default. For most users, this change will be totally unnoticed, but upstart offers some very clear advantages, such as a cleaner design and the ability to make booting faster, all of which can be read on the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ReplacementInit|Replacement Init wiki page]]</nowiki>.

== New Bootup Splash ==

All the improvements in usplash have begun to pay off, as the new theme landed for Beta. The usplash will now scale to larger screens and many different resolutions. A placeholder theme has been created, to take advantage of the new work.

== GNOME 2.16 ==

Edgy Beta comes with the latest GNOME release, GNOME 2.16. After Dapper a large amount of bugfixes and feature additions went into Gnome, 2.16 is the culmination of all the hard work that has gone into Gnome to make it more secure, faster and stable. Many applications also have been updated or added into Edgy.

=== Tomboy ===

It is a wikiwiki world out there and now your desktop does not have to left behind.  Beta comes with Tomboy pre-installed, allowing easy note taking and linking.

=== F-spot ===

With Beta comes a replacement of gthumb, the photo manager, in the form of the new mono application, F-spot. F-spot allows easy tagging, editing and uploading to various online photo websites, including Flickr.

=== Orca ===

Replacing the venerable Gnopernicus is the new Orca, a scriptable screenreader for the GNOME desktop. Expect some great things from this in the coming months and years. Best of all, it is written in Ubuntu's favourite language, Python.

== New Theme ==

The new Edgy Theme brings together the best of the art-team, new login page, new desktop wallpaper, new sounds.

=== Firefox ===
Firefox has a new theme, called 'Tangerine', which allows it blend more into the rest of the theme.

=== Rounded window borders ===
With Edgy, we've enabled rounded window borders for all corners of the window.

=== Wallpaper ===
The final piece of the new artwork is the new wallpaper.

== New translations ==

New language-packs were uploaded to Ubuntu this week, pulling the latest work out of Rosetta. If you want to help the translations teams out, head over to [Rosetta] and dive in.

== Crash Reports ==

Reporting crashes is now easier thanks to automated problem reports. When a userspace application experiences a crash a automated problem report will be generated. This means that users do not have to create debug version of software and will no longer have to spend hours trying to re-create a crash.

== Reporting Bugs ==

Edgy Eft has bugs! (I bet you're not surprised). Your comments, bug reports, patches and suggestions will help fix bugs and improve future releases. Please report bugs through Malone:

If you want to help out with those bugs, the <nowiki>[[http://wiki.ubuntu.com/BugSquad|Bug Squad]]</nowiki> is always looking for help.
