__TOC__

Ubuntu needs a plan and some discussion for a complete end to end development platform. So to start of we should look at other platforms.

=== Windows ===
Microsoft visual studio has been around for a long time and it is more or less the core of their development platform. It has a good code editor, docs, GUI designer, Version control (it costs some money but you can get it), testing, debug and deployment built in. It might cost money but it is everything you need to develop on Windows.

=== Mac ===
I dont know too much about xcode so hopefully someone can shed some light on it.
