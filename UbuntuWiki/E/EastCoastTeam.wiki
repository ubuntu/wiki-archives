'''Welcome to the EastCoastTeam Wiki'''

'' Bringing the "'''Computer that never crashes'''" to the home of the "'''Coast that never sleeps'''"''

The East Coast Team focuses on distributing, advertising, and demonstrating the Ubuntu OS (6.10 at the moment) within the entire East Coast. We work to distribute ubuntu to all types of users including businesses, schools, and home users. We believe that by bringing the freedom, power, and stability of Ubuntu Linux (and other WikiPedia:FLOSS) to the public we can change the face of computing in The East Coast for the better.
