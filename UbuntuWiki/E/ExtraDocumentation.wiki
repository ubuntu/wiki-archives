<<BR>>

The ExtraDocumentation team consolidates, rewrites, sources, maintains, and creates community documentation and tutorials. While preferring the use of free, open sources software, we will still maintain and possibly create documentation for proprietary software.

=== What do we do? ===

=== Can I Join? ===

~+We are currently looking for new members, so requirements may be lax.+~

We are open to anyone joining, however we do ask for a basic minimum of requirements for joining:
* A rewrite (along with sourcing) of an __old__ but __'''useful'''__ Ubuntu community documentation page; use .odt, .doc, or .pdf, not wiki syntax (do '''''NOT''''' actually update the page, wait for it to be accepted or rejected)
* Pretty Good English
** Fairly good grammar
* Good Writing Skills
** Use US Spelling ('''color''', not ''colour'')
** Use US abbreviations ('''NASA''', not ''Nasa'')
* Listed as having been active at least twice in the last 3 months on '''each''' of these services:
** Launchpad
** Ubuntu Forums
** Ubuntu Wiki

==== Can I Help Without Joining? ====

Sure! If you find old articles that could be potentially useful for many people, see our <nowiki>[[ExtraDocumentation-ToDo|ToDo]]</nowiki> page.

=== For Teams ===

We have resources that other teams may find useful, esp. writing resources.
