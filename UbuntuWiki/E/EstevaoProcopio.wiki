=== Involvement ===
I'm trying to get more involved to the Free Software community. I'm a coordinator of the Brazilian Portuguese Gnome Translation Project and contributed a little to the Gnome project, Helped Agney with a bugfix in the snes9express... Actualy my focus is to learn how to create deb packages and the creation of a free SDK for PalmOS. I'm also retaking an old project, meant to send and receive WinPopup messagia via SAMBA.

My involvement with the Ubuntu project is, until now, as user. I'm using breezy (yeah, it rules!) and I'm on the ubuntu-devel, ubuntu-translators and ubuntu-pt mailing lists. My intention is to be a MOTU. I think it's all...
