=== Summary ===

Laptops contain a number of power reduction features built into them. They include such things as dimming the screens and spinning down the harddrive. Not all of these features are enabled in Ubuntu.

=== Rationale ===

Increasing battery life is a good thing for all laptop users. Enabling this functionality would make Ubuntu more attractive to laptop users.

=== Use cases ===

Jim wants to watch a movie on his laptop on the flight. However, Ubuntu only gives 1 and 1/2 hours of battery life. Windows gives him just over 2, so he reboots into Windows to watch his DVD, as he knows he will be able to finish it.
