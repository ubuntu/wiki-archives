=== History with Ubuntu ===

My first linux based operating system experience was a Fedora Core 4 etherboot network at the computer lab at my high school.  My frustration with Windows drove me to using Ubuntu Studio 7.04 before my hardware was supported.  I quickly became enthralled with the rapid rate of progress I saw in Ubuntu and its community, moved exclusively to Ubuntu in early 2008, and bought an Ubuntu Dell Inspiron 1420n, and later, a hoodie and stickers :)  I've reported a bunch of bugs, supported a bunch of converts, and am very excited about the future of Free Software, in no small part because I know that I can make a difference.
