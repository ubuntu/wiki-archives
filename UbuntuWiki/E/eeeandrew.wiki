== Introduction ==
Hi all! I'm from Glasgow, Scotland, UK. I'm currently a full-time student of Electrical and Electronic Engineering with a specialism in high voltage systems! 

I'm interested in various aspects of engineering and computing. Including electromagnetism, power supply and delivery and analogue electronics. I'm interested in computer security and networking.

I can program in C++, Visual basic, MSDOS batch, PBasic and JAVA. I can use BASH fairly well and find my way around linux systems for general maintenance, administration and use. I also have experience using MATLAB and various electronic CAD packages.

== Community Involvement ==

I've now been using ubuntu linux for two and a half years. I'm now on my 4th install: the new 9.10 karmic koala release. In this time I've come across my share of problems(as a search through my forum posts would show) and I aim to use this wiki to link any useful information I have used to solve these problems.

== Problems I've had and how to solve them! ==

=== Using an Intel 82801G soundcard on ubuntu ===

This was one of my first challenges to surmount on ubuntu. On a default install this card will not function out of the box. There are many solutions to this found on various threads on the forum and the soundcard troubleshooting guides are improving constantly. I found this particular solution on google shortly after I installed 7.04 when I first started with ubuntu and it seems to still work. 

First confirm that you have the 82801G soundcard by opening terminal and entering 

sudo lspci

scroll through and you should see "audio device" followed by the name of the card.
If it is an 82801G card then carry out the following. 
Get a root file browser by entering terminal and typing:

gksudo nautilus

The usual warning applies: Working as root can severely damage your system if you get it wrong. You should not ordinarily work as root.

Now use this file browser, enter the file system and browse to etc/modprobe.d and open the alsa-base config file. 

At the bottom of this file add this following text: options snd-hda-intel position_fix=1 model=3stack

Now save, close and exit from the root file browser. The soundcard should operate when the computer is rebooted.
