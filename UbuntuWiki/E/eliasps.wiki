=== About me ===

My name is Elias, I was born and raised in Greece, studied Mathematics and Applied Mathematics at the University of Crete. I am a member of the <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu-gr.org/|Greek Ubuntu community]]</nowiki> and a moderator at the <nowiki>[[https://forum.ubuntu-gr.org/|Ubuntu-gr Forum]]</nowiki>. My main interests are in science in general, computers and of course contributing to Ubuntu, Linux and F/OSS. Since <nowiki>[[http://ubottu.com/meetingology/logs/ubuntu-meeting/2013/ubuntu-meeting.2013-07-17-12.54.log.html|17 July of 2013]]</nowiki>, I am an Ubuntu member.

==== Ubuntu and I ====

I had my first contact with Linux when I first saw it in the university's computer labs (Debian), which I used as part of a course about introduction to Computer Science. To get familiar with it, I decided to install a Linux distribution, so I searched the internet and the first results I got were about Ubuntu. I downloaded Ubuntu 7.04, installed it alongside with Windows XP and started my first steps into a whole new digital world.

As the went by, I faced several issues, but I was able to solve all of them by searching in threads of <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/forum.php|Ubuntu Forums]]</nowiki> and other Ubuntu-related sites. I hadn't realized at the time that my problems were solved because of the contribution of the community. As I was getting familiar, finding Open Source alternatives of the applications I was using, I found myself booting into Windows less and less by the day, when I finally deleted it in 2009, after being fully satisfied with Ubuntu.
Now, I use Ubuntu exclusively because per my opinion, it's the right distribution for inexperienced users as well as for power users.

==== Ubuntu-gr and I ====

I registered in <nowiki>[[https://forum.ubuntu-gr.org/|Ubuntu-gr Forum]]</nowiki> in December of 2011 to get help solving a problem I couldn't figure out. Waiting for that, I started searching in general around the forum and happened to know how to help a few other members to solve their issues. Doing that, I interacted with other experienced forum members and finally experienced first hand that the community is doing a tremendous job, helping and supporting users, advocating the use Ubuntu and F/OSS and guiding users through their troubles.

Community's contribution inspired me and I decided to get involved and be a part of it, a part of something bigger, both technologically and philosophically. I kept logging into the forum, interacting with other members, learning from their experiences and helping members to deal with their problems, as the community helped me when I was in need. 
After a year and a half, in April of 2013 some members encouraged me to apply for a moderator's rank when the moderating team back then called the forum members to apply, so I did. And during the 1st - 20th of May, 2013 <nowiki>[[https://forum.ubuntu-gr.org/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=26897&start=0|the members of the Ubuntu-gr community honored me by voting me to be one of the forum's moderators]]</nowiki>. I had the opportunity to meet in person many of the members that inspired me to get involved, by attending the <nowiki>[[https://ubuntu-gr.org/content/ubuntu-release-party-raring-ringtail-athens-2013|Ubuntu 13.04 Release Party]]</nowiki> in Athens at May 12, 2013, organized by Ubuntu-gr.

=== Contribution ===

 {*} '''Active member at <nowiki>[[https://forum.ubuntu-gr.org/|Ubuntu-gr Forum]]</nowiki>:''' ''Since my registration at Ubuntu-gr forum and after realizing the vast contribution of the community, I decided to be a part of that contribution. As an active member of the community I had the opportunity to learn a lot of new stuff and I'm using my experience to promote Ubuntu, motivate people to get involved and help users with their problems in any way I can. I believe that everyone can contribute in many ways, and by helping others I try to move their curiosity so that they as well can get involved. I also try to translate into Greek several resources, like the <nowiki>[[https://eliasps.gitbooks.io/linux-sysadmin-tutorials-the-linux-foundation/content/|Linux Sysadmin Tutorials from The Linux Foundation]]</nowiki> to help the readers further expand their knowledge base (and mine).''

 {*} '''Former Moderator at <nowiki>[[https://forum.ubuntu-gr.org/|Ubuntu-gr Forum]]</nowiki> (currently over 12.000 members):''' ''As a moderator, I try my best to create a very friendly environment in the forum and keep it organized, so the users can feel comfortable and get support effectively. Of course, older and more experienced moderators have helped me a lot with my first steps as a forum moderator.'' '''''[May 2013 - January 2017 (stepped down because of pending military duty)]'''''

 {*} '''Former Moderator/Administrator at <nowiki>[[https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/113489005803686865491|Google+ ''Ubuntu Greece'' community]]</nowiki> (currently about 1500 members) & <nowiki>[[https://www.facebook.com/groups/ubuntugr/|Facebook ''Ubuntu-gr'' group]]</nowiki> (currently about 5500 members):''' ''I believe that social networks can truly serve the cause of spreading the word about Open Source, even using the wrong way to do it. A very large percentage of the world is using social networks. And the community's presence in social networking is very important for advocating Open Source Software in Greece. So, I try to keep the users updated about Ubuntu news and development. I also administrate Ubuntu-gr's pages on <nowiki>[[https://www.facebook.com/ubuntugr|Facebook]]</nowiki> & <nowiki>[[https://plus.google.com/u/0/+ubuntugr/videos|Google Plus]]</nowiki>'', as well as Ubuntu GNOME's <nowiki>[[https://www.facebook.com/UbuntuGNOME|Facebook]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/108356762331170101188/+UbuntuGNOMEorg/posts|Google Plus]]</nowiki> pages. '''''[May 2013 - January 2017 (stepped down because of pending military duty)]'''''

 {*} '''Designer & Co-ordinator of <nowiki>[[http://ubuntistas.ubuntu-gr.org/|Ubuntistas]]</nowiki>:''' ''Ubuntistas is the magazine of the Ubuntu-gr community. I am a member of the team as a designer and <nowiki>[[http://forum.ubuntu-gr.org/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=28951|by using LaTeX]]</nowiki>, I bring the magazine into its final form. <nowiki>[[http://forum.ubuntu-gr.org/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=27151#p288816|Ubuntistas is available at Ubuntu Software Center and it's free and open for everyone]]</nowiki>. Working with the team it's been an amazing experience and I hope for many more issues in the future.''

 {*} '''User support on <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu-gr.org/webchat|IRC (#ubuntu-gr)]]</nowiki>:''' ''I am present in Ubuntu-gr IRC channel (#ubuntu-gr) in case someone needs direct support. There have been cases in which users needed help with Ubuntu installation and advanced partitioning, that got solved in IRC. I created a tutorial called "<nowiki>[[http://forum.ubuntu-gr.org/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=25314#p268594|Dual Boot Windows 7-Ubuntu 12.10 (Windows: pre-installed)]]</nowiki>" to help new users to install Ubuntu. I try to guide new users and motivate them to learn more about Ubuntu and be a part of the community.''

 {*} '''<nowiki>[[https://translations.launchpad.net/~eliasps/+activity|Translating]]</nowiki> Ubuntu in Greek:''' ''Translating Ubuntu helped me a lot to get a closer look into the system. It's one way to contribute to Ubuntu without having any special technical knowledge, but just the willingness to contribute. I have translated several messages. In the future I plan to translate way more.''

 
 {*} '''Testing Ubuntu:''' ''Testing is essential for having a high-quality operating system on our computers. As a tester, I like tweaking the system in various ways to detect bugs and report them using the current Ubuntu and Ubuntu GNOME releases, as well as the unber-development releases of those distributions.''

 {*} '''Author at <nowiki>[[http://ubuntu-gr.org|ubuntu-gr.org]]</nowiki>:''' ''Trying to keep our main website up to date with upcoming events and developments from the world of the community, Ubuntu and F/OSS.''

 {*} '''Motivating users to get involved:''' ''Every user can contribute to Ubuntu and the community. For instance, if one gets a solution to a problem, one can write a tutorial about that. In an collaborative project, two members (<nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~fkol-k4|fkol k4]]</nowiki> & <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NikTh|NikTh]]</nowiki>) and I wrote a tutorial on how to create effective guides, called "<nowiki>[[http://forum.ubuntu-gr.org/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=26328#p278880|Πως δημιουργούμε έναν πλήρη οδηγό (tutorial) για το forum]]</nowiki>" (How to create a complete tutorial for the forum), in which we encourage and guide members to write their own tutorials, while promoting collaboration.''

 {*} '''Contributing to Ubuntu GNOME:''' ''I am a supporter of the GNOME Project and I think Ubuntu GNOME is a great way to conbine my favourite Desktop Environment and my favourite Linux distribution. I try spread the word about Ubuntu GNOME, contribute on its development cyrcle and help with the organizing process. I wrote a turotial called "<nowiki>[[https://cerebrux.gitbooks.io/-ubuntu-packaging/content/|Εισαγωγή στο Ubuntu Packaging]]</nowiki>" (Introduction to Ubuntu Packaging) to help Greek users get started with the packaging basics, as we lack documentation on that area in Greek. It's a privilege for me, being a part of the Ubuntu GNOME team!''

 {*} '''Advocating Ubuntu, Linux and FOSS:''' ''All of the above result in this. Making Ubuntu better means making computing and user experience better. The community is of critical importance for bringing freedom into the digital world and we can accomplish that by helping and motivating users to join an already vast growing community.''

=== Future Goals ===

I have many goals that I would like to accomplish in the future regarding my involvement in Ubuntu. I believe there are other ways as well to contribute to Ubuntu and so I intend to:

 {*} '''Develop applications for Ubuntu Desktop and Ubuntu Phone:''' ''I am a C, C++, Java and Python developer and I have many ideas for applications which I will try to create, given enough time free of responsibilities, to make Ubuntu user experience even better.''

 {*} '''Get more involved in the Translation Project:''' ''Although I have translated messages in Greek, my involvement in translation is not as strong as I want it to be. I believe I can contribute more to the work of the Ubuntu Greek Translators team.''

 {*} '''Test Ubuntu releases for detecting bugs and reporting them:''' ''I believe bug tracking and reporting is an essential part to improve Ubuntu. So I will try to do just that and encourage other users to do so. For that, I wrote a tutorial called "<nowiki>[[http://forum.ubuntu-gr.org/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=26725#p283920|Πως αναφέρουμε σφάλματα (bugs) στο Launchpad]]</nowiki>" (How to report bugs in Launchpad) to guide users through the process of bug reporting and another one called "<nowiki>[[http://forum.ubuntu-gr.org/viewtopic.php?f=70&t=31551&start=0|Ubuntu +1: Testing & Bug Triaging]]</nowiki>" ('''Special thanks to <nowiki>[[NikTh]]</nowiki>''' who created the <nowiki>[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjTsiERneCE|video presentation]]</nowiki> of the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/QATracker|QA Tracker]]</nowiki> that is a part of this turorial) to help users get involved with Ubuntu testing and bug triaging.''

 {*} '''Join more teams in Launchpad:''' ''For testing hardware and contribute in general as a tester or developer. I have already started searching for teams where I can be useful.''

 {*} '''Keep advocating Ubuntu and helping users:''' ''Always under the <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/about/about-ubuntu/conduct|Ubuntu Code of Conduct]]</nowiki>, I intend to continue helping users where I can and advocating Ubuntu and F/OSS.''
