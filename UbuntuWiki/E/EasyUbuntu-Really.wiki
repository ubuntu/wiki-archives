What is Easy Ubuntu ?
It's an easy to use tool to install copyrighted, patented, proprietary, ... softwares which cannot be installed by default for legal issues.

It must respect Ubuntu core devs choices (ie: not install Banshee to replace Rhythmbox or Epiphany to replace Firefox) and it '''must''' be safe for the system.

Easy Ubuntu is not a Package manager like "Add/Remove softwares ..." or Synaptic.

'''Easy ?'''

The current interface is still too complicated for a not-computer scientist. They are too much options and they are not easy to understand.

The interface must be really easy, just a small explication and a button to do all the tasks.
An "advanced" interface must also exists to choose exactly what the tool must do.

Here is a (glade) draft of this interface :

As you can see, I'm (keyes) still working on this.

The only option allow to choose if the tool can install a proprietary driver (NVIDIA or ATI cards) because it's a highly critical feature.

The advanced button show the actual window of Easy Ubuntu:

'''Safe ?'''

Easy Ubuntu must only use officials repositories (main, Universe, Multiverse, Commercial) and the PLF repository. It distribute only "packages that cannot be included into the Ubuntu distribution for legal reasons (copyright, license, patent, etc)." ( https://launchpad.net/products/plf ).

No backports, no special version of Wine, ... (or as an advanced option).

It must backup all modified/removed files and '''don't touch to the original sources.lst'''.

It must only use packages to install softwares (no savages installs).
