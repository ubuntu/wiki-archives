=== Miscellaneous Notes ===
On initial installation use a USB keyboard & mouse.

After Ubuntu is installed & rebooted, goto '''System Settings''' then '''Assistive Technologies''' then '''Preferred Applications''' then '''Mobility''' select '''onBoard''' and check the box for '''Run at Start'''

This will enable the on-screen virtual keyboard on system boot so you can enter initial login/password information.

==== For 2 finger Multi-touch refer to the following resources ====

There is a Blog by a WeTab user (etheros) that contains a lot of good Ubuntu & WeTab/ExoPC configuration information:

http://wetabz.blogspot.com/search?updated-max=2011-06-07T09%3A12%3A00-07%3A00&max-results=4

The above Blog also refers to the following Ubuntu pages:

==== How to setup Multi-Boot - with MeeGo, Ubuntu, Windows - from Intel AppUp Developer Website ====

http://appdeveloper.intel.com/en-us/blog/2011/07/07/creating-multi-boot-exopc-tablet

==== Upgrading the SSD drive - YouTube video ====

'''Note:'''

Both the ExoPC and WeTab use the mini pci-e SSD format.  These come in two "carrier" formats.  One is a longer card and one is a 1/2 length card.   If you buy a 1/2 length card you will need to also buy a $20 card extender so the 1/2 length card can be attached to it, then inserted into the Tablet and screwed down using the tablet's mounting screws.

==== Upgrading the WeTab 1GB RAM to 2GB RAM -- YouTube video (in German but video is easy to follow and process can be done in less than 5 minutes) ====

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0gL1c39uHs

==== WeTab 16GB SSD version tablet does NOT come with the Crystal HD Codec ====

It is relatively easy to install after viewing the above video's concerning opening the case for RAM or SSD upgrades.

A source for the card is the HB-VD920 Broadcom Crystal HD PCI express Mini Card AVC/VC-1/H.264 Enhanced Hardware Decoder/Accelerator by Habey USA
