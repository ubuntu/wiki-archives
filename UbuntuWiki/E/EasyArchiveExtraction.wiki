=== Summary ===

EasyCodecInstallation was a great leap forward to providing an easy method for non-technical end users to watch and listen to their media. If we could expand this process to Archive Manager, we would be yet another step closer to being format "transparent".

The infrastructure is already there (libgimme, changes to apt, gnome-app-install), so hopefully this wont be too hard!

=== Use Cases ===

=== Scope ===

Core: file-roller, libgimme/libgimme-codec
Potentially adding mime-types into packages: unrar/unrar-free, unace/unace-nonfree, ...

=== Design ===
=== Implementation ===
