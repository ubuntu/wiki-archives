Hello

I am a member of the Ubuntu community with a focus on the Mac platform. Currently working on wiki pages to do with hardware compatability and user experience.

Recently, I committed more fully to the Ubuntu community by signing the Code of Conduct http://www.ubuntulinux.org/community/conduct

I have adopted the UbuntuOnMac UbuntuOnMacDetails and KernelBuildPPCHowTo pages to start me off on helping out.
