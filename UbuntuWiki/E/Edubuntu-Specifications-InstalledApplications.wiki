=== Merge of 4 old docs ===

== Application Selection ==

'''** Note that all decisions taken now are for Edubuntu version 1.0 due for Oct 2005, they may be revisited/expanded for later releases. **''' <<BR>> 

The Application list belongs to Oliver Grawert - ogra - contact him if you have any comments, suggestions or concerns please contact: Oliver Grawert mailto:<ogra@ubuntu.com>

* Desktop Default- Decision GNOME
* Languages - Decision, default English, and then as many of the supported 90 Ubuntu languages as can fit on the installer CD (all 90 languages will be on the DVD).
* Age Group - School going age, Below 18. No university content is being considered at this time.
* Emerging Applications - How will new applications be identified, evaluated and selected in the future? - We will need to receive feedback after the first release is out and evolve this process over time, based on what works, what doesn't and what people request.
* Target Market for applications - while applications for the learners are required, the main requirement now is for teacher tools, to enable teachers to create teaching content, worksheets, cross words, tests.
* Note that applications must have descriptions on the menus as people may not know what the application is from it's name.
* Brief for the application list: initial application list for Breezy, but will have lists of other applications for users to look at and evaluate.
* Suggestion to have an install question which will offer to allow for installation of meta-packages for either Junior or Senior packages, or both. May have to be looked at for Breezy +1 if this proves to be a lot of work.

==== Other applications to consider ====

* Mind mapping - view your mind - consider http://cmap.ihmc.us/ or http://freemind.sourceforge.net (CJK support for freemind sucks)
* Music notation sequncing - Rose Garden - not easy to configure etc (denemo concentrates on music score layout, rosegarden concentrates on music synthesis)
* request made for data logging software.
* kmultiply (doesnt exist, but funnily is a dependency in skolelinux)
* KWordQuiz
* Circuit design programs (for electronic courses - older kids)

* Elgg (claims itself to be alpha version, not suitable yet)
* Tablix/GTablix (timetable generation)
* Smbfs
** as this allows OOo, GIMP etc to work directly with samba shares, they seem to have problems interfacing with standard sambaclient stuff, or is that just me? MGB
** cifs is a much better replacement and has better unicode support, with smbfs some files with CJK file names simply can't open at all -- AbelCheung4
* Dr. Geo, an interactive geometry teaching tool (existing package name: drgeo)
* geg, gnumexp (was rejected once, reason: for equations, replaced by OpenOffice.org)
** Please reconsider. geg is a graph plotter, while gnumexp does symbolic calculation. Can OpenOffice.org do anything like these? Though I admit gnumexp is real headache for packaging, tried it before -- AbelCheung4

==== Other applications NOT wanted or with problems ====

===== applications not wanted or replaced by something else =====

* gperiodic
* gtablix + tablix (replaced by schooltool - not so, these programs use genetic algorithms to create a timetable from user supplied requirements and constraints, whereas schooltool is used to publish that timetable - worth exploring integration -MGB)
* gtypist (replaced by ktype)
* Ggradebook 	(couldn't find ubuntu package, could be dropped easily - schooltool will get there)
* gtk+ (this a toolkit, not an app)
* xmaxima? (math - derive-like commandline math interpreter; worth keeping for the 6th form maths classes)

===== applications with probs =====

* klettres (only french and english, not for the default install)
* gvr (programming for kids, only english, not for the default install)

===== applications with bugs to be sorted before release =====

* gdis? (molecule viewer) (packaging bugs)
* ghemical (packaging bugs)
''both are precision tools for atomic or molecular modelling and not aimed at our target. Atomix is a game and sounds like fun.'' 
* celestia-gnome (packaging bugs)
* childsplay (packaging bugs)
* flashkard (not in breezy, replaced by KWordQuiz)

==============================================================  ==

This is the list of files used for the edubuntu-desktop metapackage for our first release, feel free to make suggestions for changes in the area at the bottom with a rationale for discussion.
This list is based on the K12Ltsp package list with replacements where appropriate/necessary. Problems with packages are noted next to the package name (i.e. missing .desktop files (menu entrys))

The default themes for QT and GTK should be similar and match color and font to appear as consistent as possible.

This is the suggestion for the default desktop. 
A EdubuntuLight desktop should be defined too with focus on a lower ressource usage and smaller footprint which requires a different selection of applications.

=== Applist of desktop apps by menu entry ===

* '''Internet'''
* evolution (''mail/calendar'')
* firefox (''browser'')
* (do we want IRC/Instant Messenger or gnomemeeting ?)

* '''Educational'''
* ggradebook (''grade manager'') (could need a gtk2 patch/rewrite)	
* gperiodic (''periodic table app'')
* gtablix (''class schedule manager'') (or better <nowiki>[[http://www.schooltool.org|SchoolTool/SchoolBell]]</nowiki> installed on the classroom server and a simple .desktop entry that calls a browser with the local schooltool url)
* teachertool (''classroom client management'') (needs rewrite and adjustment for the new ubuntu ltsp infrastructure we will have in breezy) (see TeachersPet for a better suggestion)
* celestia-gnome (''visual space simulation'')
* gcompris (''edu games'')
* gtypist	(''type training'') (missing .desktop file)
* geg	(''equation grapher'') (missing .desktop file, could be replaced by gnumexp http://numexp.sourceforge.net/)

* '''Office''''
* openoffice (''office suite'')
* glabels (''label/businesscard designer'')
* scribus (''DTP'') (or passepartout) 

* '''Development'''
* meld (''diff viewer'')
* bluefish (''web editor'') (or better nvu ?)
* monodevelop (''IDE'')

* '''Games'''
* tuxtype (''typeing game'')
* tuxmath (''math game'')
* atomix  (''chemical game'')
* glife   (''game of life'')

* '''Graphics'''
* dia (''diagram editor'')
* evince (''document viewer'')
* gthumb (''picture catalog'')
* inkscape (''vector drawing and DTP program'')
* tuxpaint (''paint'')
* gimp (''image editor'')
* blender (''3D design'')
***** qcad (?) (''CAD'')
* xsane (''scanning software'')

* '''Multimedia'''
* totem (''video player'')
* rhythmbox (''audio player'')
* kino (''video editor'')
* istanbul (''capture video from screen'')
***** audacity (''audio editor'')

* '''Utilities'''
* backup tool (mondo/mindi (i386 only) or something like uberbackup: http://www.mooncheese.org/projects/uberbackup/ ?? )
***** bibshelf (''book Catalog tool'')
* gnome's standard toolset (dict wordbook client, gedit, charmap etc)

==== Suggestions ====

Please put your suggestions for changes/replacements of the above applist here. Put a rationale why you want it added/removed/replaced next to the appname.

I highly recommend having at least IRC if not GAIM as well. IRC is very useful for educational computer lab environments. Take for example one needs assistance with SchoolTool or what not. #schooltool.... easy way to communicate with the rest of the community. -Colin A.

* If it is ready in time: World Wind linux version. See http://forum.worldwind.arc.nasa.gov/index.php?showtopic=3780 Useful for geography.

* Stellarium: renders realistic skies in real time with openGL

* Claroline : This is a nice Learning management system in PHP/MySQL, providing an easy way for a teacher to set a website for a course: forums, chat, document repositories, group management tool, course calendar, learning path,... very easy to take in hand more info on the project site : http://www.claroline.net -Guim

* I thought we agreed Moodle over Claroline?
* Kalzium is a better Periodic Table than Gperiodic and Kig is a good graph plotter.Are they omitted from the list because they will be included with K12? - John

* Sorry I didn't see Moodle or any LMS in the list, I dont know if any decision was taken by anyone yet. But if I can give my opinion about this, I do think Claroline is closer to the Ubuntu philosophy (as I understood it) : very simple interfaces for the end user, very easy to take in hand but highly integrated and complete. Moodle is more full of options but sometime so many that it confuses the user. I do not want to start a debate, but I would be very happy if this option could be considered and of course, I could help for this. -guim

* There are software tools most teachers will use, for example OpenOffice.org is such an example. So it is easy to know about these software. 
However, there are tools specific to teaching domains. It will be wise to have such a list of software. Then in the Gnome menu hierarchy, to have differents menu categories for each teaching domain. -HilaireFernandes

* How about adding Gtans: <nowiki>[[http://gtans.sourceforge.net]]</nowiki>.  I know the gifted classes in the school district I work at use this type of software pretty heavily.  There is an existing ubuntu package. In addition to Bluefish also consider NVU: <nowiki>[[http://www.nvu.com]]</nowiki> -Dann S. Washko

* I want to teach LaTeX, through LyX, to my AP Calculus students this year. Please include LyX, as well as TeTeX or another TeX distribution that has AMSTeX in it. I also second the inclusion of Nvu, especially for the built-in W3C validation. As a high school math/CS teacher, my biases are obvious: the word processor is inferior to a good formatting mark-up language. As a 21st century educator, I feel it is worthwhile to teach a type of literacy relevant for the present and the future. See http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/wp.html for a good argument against teaching students to use a word processor.
  -Jeremy Gross, Somerville, MA USA

* Suggest considering removing Evolution and replacing with Thunderbird (and Sunbird).  A big call - given Evolution ships as a part of the Ubuntu distribution - however, many students (like it or not) will not have access to GNU/Linux systems at home.  Thunderbird/Sunbird run reliably on Win32, meaning they can apply what they learn in their home environment.
  -Robert Balbir-Brott

* looks like ggradebook is no longer maintained.  is it really a good idea to include umaintained software in a distribution aimed at teachers?

* What about Open Admin - http://richtech.ca/openadmin/  THere isn't a .deb package yet, but it is a great program according to some people I've talked to.
----
* To elaborate a bit more on the "light" desktop suggestion, and after seeing all the suggestions here, I think it would '''really''' be helpful to have various levels or gradated options for typical academic subject areas for the desktop to choose from at install time such that a teacher (or someone helping them to set this up - still a lot of teachers are intimidated by computers despite an interest or mandate to make use of them) can click on options that make sense to them in teaching terms.  

Thus, my wife, a first-grade teacher, would be able to pick from various packages suitable for "early elementary" level, say, such as word processing (tuxwrite?), geography, "gCompris", and other levels such as upper elementary, middle school, secondary, AP, etc. would be available for those interested in them accordingly.  Still, there would be the need to mix and match from all available packages depending on a teacher's  computer skills, teaching style, local school system mandates, etc.  

Also, there is a need for an easy facility to add on later as the year progresses, and the subject areas' emphases might change, or the teacher becomes more comfortable with "expanded horizons" (or new packages become available - a dynamic update mechanism should be available to avoid the pain of full re-installs).

=== gcompris ===
* Description: Educational games for small children

A collection of educational games for small children. It is meant to become some sort of nified interface to integrate more educational games.

Language-oriented games now contain vocabulary for too many languages to list them here.  Sounds are only available for a couple of languages - contribute and add your language!

Currently available boards include:
* learning how to use a mouse and keyboard
* learning simple arithmetic
* learning how to read an analog clock
* recognize letters after hearing their names
* reading practice
* small games (memory games, jigsaw puzzles, ...)
* etc.

It is designed so that it is easy to implement new boards to GCompris.

To save SVG from the animation board, you will need python-xml.

=== ktuberling ===
* Description: Potato Guy for KDE

KTuberling is a game intended for small children. Of course, it may be suitable for adults who have remained young at heart.

It is a potato editor. That means that you can drag and drop eyes, mouths, moustache, and other parts of face and goodies onto a potato-like guy.  Similarly, you have a penguin on which you can drop other stuff.

There is no winner for the game. The only purpose is to make the funniest faces you can.

There is a museum (like a "Madame Tusseau" gallery) where you can find many funny examples of decorated potatoes. Of course, you can send your own creations to the programmer, Eric Bischoff, who will include them in the museum if he gets some spare time.

=== tuxpaint ===
* Description: A paint program for young children

Tux Paint is meant to be a simple drawing program for young children.  It is not meant as a general-purpose drawing tool.
It IS meant to be fun and easy to use.  Sound effects and a cartoon character help let the user know what's going on, and keeps them entertained.

Tux Paint is extensible.  Brushes and "rubber stamp" shapes can be dropped in and pulled out.  For example, a teacher can drop in a collection of animal shapes and ask their students to draw an ecosystem.  Each shape can have a sound which is played, and textual facts which are displayed, when the child selects the shape.

There is no direct access to the computer's underlying intricacies. The current image is kept when the program quits, and reappears when it is restarted.  Saving images requires no need to create filenames or use the keyboard.  Opening an image is done by selecting it from a collection of thumbnails.

* Description: vocabulary trainer for KDE

`KVoc`Train is a little utility to help you train your vocabulary when you are trying to learn a foreign language.  You can create your own database with the words you need.  It is intended as a replacement for index (flash) cards.

You probably remember flashcards from school.  The teacher would write the original expression on the front side of the card and the translation on the back.  Then look at the cards one after another.  If you knew the translation, you could put it away.  If you failed, you put it back to try again.

`KVoc`Train is not intended to teach you grammar or other sophisticated things.  This is and probably will stay beyond the scope of this application.

=== kig ===
* Description: interactive geometry program for KDE

Kig is an application for interactive geometry.  It is intended to serve two purposes:

* to allow students to interactively explore mathematical figures and concepts using the computer;
* to serve as a WYSIWYG tool for drawing mathematical figures and including them in other documents.

With this program you can do geometry on a computer just like you would on a blackboard in a classroom.  However, the program allows you to move and change parts of a geometrical drawing so that you can see how the other parts change as a result.

Kig supports loci and user-defined macros.  It also supports imports and exports to/from foreign file formats including Cabri, Dr. Geo, KGeo, KSeg and XFig.

This package is part of the official KDE edutainment module.

Graphic formats which can be placed in Scribus as images include PDF, Encapsulated Post Script (eps), TIFF, JPEG, PNG and XPixMap(xpm), and any bitmap type supported by QT3.

Printing, PDF and SVG creation are done via custom driver libraries and plug-ins, giving Scribus inventive features: the abilities to include presentation effects with PDF output, fully scriptable interactive PDF forms, SVG vector file output. The internal printer drivers fully support Level 2 and Level 3/PDF 1.4 postscript features including transparency and
font embedding.

When run from KDE, Drag and Drop, for example from desktop to the canvas, is enabled. There is easy to use drag and drop scrapbook for frequently used items such as text blocks, pictures and custom shaped frames.

=== schooltool ===
* Description: common platform for school administration

SchoolTool is an open source school management information system.  It is a distributed client/server system.  The SchoolTool server presents two interfaces to clients:

* a traditional web application interface, usable with an ordinary browser.

* HTTP-based programming interface suitable for fat clients, adhering to the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style (see http://rest.blueoxen.net/).

The web application interface is the primary one.  The RESTive interface is there for potential interoperability with other systems and fat clients to perform data entry that is inconvenient to do via the web application interface.

Any modern web browser is suitable for the web application interface.  The interface degrades gracefully, so a browser that does not support CSS or Javascript will be usable, although perhaps not very nice or convenient.

This package is a configuration package which sets up a standard stand alone server.

== Possible Edubuntu Software to be included/considered ==

/!\ '''If it's already in, please delete it from the following list.'''

This page contains an annotated list of software which is of particular importance
to the Edubuntu distro.

=== Teaching Programming ===

** drpython -- Available in the development section of Universe
** pythoncard -- Available in the Python Programming section of Universe (see note #1)
** pygame -- Available in the Python Programming section of Universe

Note #1: In order to run pythoncard one MUST remove the libwxgtk2.4-python package or pythoncard will FAIL to start. I (Colin) tried hacking the pythoncard source to select the wxPython version (2.5.8.3) over the 2.4.2.4 wxPython libraries with no success. Pythoncard still failed to start.
** Remove the libwxgtk2.4-python package for an Edubuntu install? 

=== K12LTSP Software ===

I thought it might be a good idea to incorporate what's already in K12LTSP (more or less in order of importance):

* Ggradebook (couldn't find ubuntu package)

=== Wikipedia ===
Maybe by adding a Static Wikipedia version it would help Schools that don't have Internet Access.
I know of a Static Version that is about 380 MB Compressed.

Will update this section shortly...
