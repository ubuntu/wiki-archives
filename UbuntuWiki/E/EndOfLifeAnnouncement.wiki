Ubuntu announced its 9.04 release almost 18 months ago, on April 23,
2009. As with the earlier releases, Ubuntu committed to ongoing security
and critical fixes for a period of 18 months. The support period is now
nearing its end and Ubuntu 9.04 will reach end of life on Friday,
October 23, 2010. At that time, Ubuntu Security Notices will no longer
include information or updated packages for Ubuntu 9.04.

The supported upgrade path from Ubuntu 9.04 is via Ubuntu 9.10.
Instructions and caveats for the upgrade may be found at
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/KarmicUpgrades. Note that upgrades to
version 10.04 LTS and beyond are only supported in multiple steps, via
an upgrade first to 9.10, then to 10.04 LTS. Both Ubuntu 9.10 and Ubuntu
10.04 LTS continue to be actively supported with security updates and
select high-impact bug fixes. All announcements of official security
updates for Ubuntu releases are sent to the ubuntu-security-announce
mailing list, information about which may be found at
https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-security-announce.

Since its launch in October 2004 Ubuntu has become one of the most
highly regarded Linux distributions with millions of users in homes,
schools, businesses and governments around the world. Ubuntu is Open
Source software, costs nothing to download, and users are free to
customise or alter their software in order to meet their needs.
