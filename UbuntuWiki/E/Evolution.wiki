* Calendar (local, ical, Exchange)
* Contacts (local, Exchange)
* Memos
* Tasks

=== Setup ===

* EvolutionPopMail
* EvolutionIMAPMail

=== Spellcheck ===
It's possible to install extra languages for Evolution through the aspell-* packages:

* Find the name of the language pack you want through a <nowiki>[[http://packages.ubuntu.com/cgi-bin/search_packages.pl?keywords=aspell-&searchon=names&subword=1&version=all&release=all|search on the packages database]]</nowiki> (e.g. aspell-da for danish)
* Install the package:
<pre>
sudo apt-get install aspell-da
</pre>
* Voila! You might have to restart Evolution in order for it to recognize it.

You can find the spellchecking option under Edit -> Preferences -> Composer Preferences -> Spell Checking
