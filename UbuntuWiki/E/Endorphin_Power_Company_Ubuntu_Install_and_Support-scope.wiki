This project was started on October 1st, 2007, due to the generous donation of 25 computers to the The Endorphin Power Company by Charter Bank of Albuquerque, New Mexico.  The New Mexico Ubuntu LoCo is in the process of installing the Ubuntu operating system on the donated computers, as well as negotiating a service level agreement to provide limited support and training for The Endorphin Power Company.

The Endorphin Power Company is dedicated to improving the lives of people, with special focus on the substance-dependent and homeless, thus alleviating many of the challenges faced by current emergency medical systems. Additional purposes are the promotion of mental and physical health through exercise, and the promotion of energy consciousness and volunteerism.

Our Goal as the New Mexico Ubuntu Loco is to show organizations such as the EPC that we can demonstrate the knowledge and expertise to allow them to have very good technology services and support while maintain no cost (or very little cost) and the spirit of Ubuntu (humanity to others).
