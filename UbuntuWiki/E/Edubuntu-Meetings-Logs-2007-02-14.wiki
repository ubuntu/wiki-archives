<pre>
09:01	ogra	on my side there is not much for tech  ... last week was bus feautre freeze week ... this week is herd4 preparation week
09:01	ogra	*busy
09:02	ogra	so all i can say, help testing ! https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/ReportingResults has the new testing procedures
09:03	ogra	to compensate the not implemented fat clients i enabled the kiosk plugin in ltsp ... you are able to build a webkiosk now very easily
09:04	ogra	so we have at least the basic structure for a fat client ... people wanting a full desktop kiosk mode can even install (ed)ubuntu-desktop in the client ...
09:04	willvdl	cool
09:04	willvdl	had a chat with heno
09:04	willvdl	seems LP is used mainly for test tracking (ooh what's that link again)
09:04	ogra	it explains how to use LP :)
09:05	ogra	what i'd like to point out to everyone is: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/UES-Sevilla
09:05	juliux	evening
09:05	juliux	sorry i am late
09:05	ogra	we will have our next educational conference in may
09:05	willvdl	ogra: yeah :) https://launchpad.net/ubuntu-iso-tests
09:06	willvdl	v. excited about this
09:06	ogra	from may 3rd to may 4th we'll try to gather as many educators as possible in sevilla
09:06	ogra	anybody is free to come indeed :)
09:06	Spec	in spain?
09:06	ogra	yep
09:07	willvdl	yip
09:07	willvdl	right before UDS
09:07	ogra	it is directly attached to UDS
09:08	ogra	anyway, thats all from my side unless there are questions
09:08	willvdl	as RichEd would put it, it is a conf aimed at both "above the desktop" and "below"
09:08	ogra	oh, if you test feisty, please test the serveraddon iso as well
09:08	willvdl	how's 2nd CD coming along?
09:08	willvdl	haven't had a chance to look this week
09:09	ogra	well, i havent done the seed changes yet
09:09	juliux	ogra, when is herd4 released?
09:09	LaserJock	well, I still have a list of MIR Candidates at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/JordanMantha/EdubuntuMIRCandidates
09:09	ogra	so it's still the same as last week
09:09	juliux	or will release
09:09	ogra	juliux, tomorrow is ETA ... dunno if it will make it
09:09	juliux	ogra, yes my fault i thought today is already the 15th;9
09:09	LaserJock	I've almost finished a MIR for rasmol (I had a nightmare the other day that iwj found a CVE I didn't find)
09:10	ogra	i'm planning to shuffle the seeds as soon as the Cd is out ... the dailies after that miught break horribly, so be careful
09:10	willvdl	LaserJock, rasmol?
09:10	ogra	LaserJock, heh
09:10	LaserJock	molecule visualization
09:10	ogra	LaserJock, so we share some fears actually :)
09:10	LaserJock	it's like the first chemistry app I used
09:11	LaserJock	the problem I'm seeing is the field get's narrowed down very fast if you take out apps that have a lot of dependencies in Universe and ones that aren't maintained well (either in Debian or upstream)
09:11	ogra	yep
09:12	ogra	but the field of apps in main we dont ship yet is big as well
09:12	ogra	i'm pretty sure we'll get together something sufficient for feisty ... even if only one or two new apps come from universe
09:13	LaserJock	I'd like to get qcad, octave, and stellarium in
09:13	ogra	qucad is a good one
09:13	ogra	-u
09:13	LaserJock	drgeo has a dead upstream otherwise I'd do it
09:13	ajmitch	is moodle going into main?
09:13	LaserJock	it'll have to be reworked
09:13	LaserJock	i.e. not for Feisty that I  know of
09:13	ogra	ajmitch, it would have needed to be in before FF
09:13	LaserJock	maybe ogra's worked on that
09:14	ajmitch	ogra: a shame
09:14	ogra	yeah
09:14	LaserJock	I'd *like* to do it for Feisty+1
=== ajmitch of course has authtool still stuck in NEW, so it won't get into main
09:14	ogra	i'll package the most recent version for feisty+1 closely working with upstream (who will come to UES i hope)
09:14	LaserJock	I was going to do it for Feisty but my time has been severly short
09:15	ogra	it can be a ubuntuesque package that doesnt need to go to debian i.e. moodle1.7
09:15	LaserJock	as far as 2nd CD stuff goes
09:16	LaserJock	I really need feedback from educators
09:16	ajmitch	ogra: I suggest looking at dbconfig-common to replace wwwconfig-common :)
09:16	ogra	that saves us headdaches with upgrade paths and gives us the possibility to keep the 1.6 package for people who want it ...
09:16	LaserJock	I have some ideas of packages but I'd rather package what educators already know they need, rather than what I think they need
09:16	ogra	ajmitch, well, either that or totally without ***config-common
09:17	ajmitch	if you want to write all the db creation & management scripts yourself
09:17	ogra	for new packages we have all options :)
09:17	ogra	notMax, but i can ask upstream to maintain them in a way that my postinst doesnt need to be freakys
09:18	LaserJock	ogra: how strict is the "only one app for each task" for Edubuntu?
09:18	ogra	that was supposed to read "no", sorry notMax
09:18	ogra	LaserJock, depends, what do you propose ?
09:18	LaserJock	I found several good calculator/function plotter type apps
09:19	LaserJock	but they are really for different levels
09:19	willvdl	LaserJock, I would imagine they would also tie into different backends?
09:19	ogra	do you think you will find more of such apps ?
09:19	LaserJock	lybniz is a really basic and usable function plotter that would be good for younger kids
09:19	LaserJock	but qalculate is a really cool and powerful calculator (I hate to even call it that)
09:19	LaserJock	it does unit conversion, plotting, etc.
09:19	willvdl	and the kde one? kplot is it?
09:20	ogra	kig i think
09:20	LaserJock	yeah, there are a few kde ones
09:20	LaserJock	qalculate has both gtk and qt versions I believe
09:20	willvdl	yeah, kig
09:20	LaserJock	seperate source though, which is weird
09:20	willvdl	LaserJock, what about Logo/Squeak type thingies?
09:21	LaserJock	Squeak is non-free
09:21	LaserJock	not sure what we have for Logo
09:21	ogra	we should go with the best still ... if we find more apps to categorize them i.e. in an edubuntu-science-advanced metapackage we should do so ...
09:21	ogra	we have kturtle
09:21	willvdl	love kturtle
09:21	LaserJock	ogra: my point was, if I find apps that are sort of the same thing, just designed for different age ranges, is that considered a duplicate?
09:21	ogra	thjats apparently still the best logo app
09:22	willvdl	kturtle :)
09:22	ogra	LaserJock, not if we can group them into install tasks i would say
09:22	ogra	if its only one single app i'd say we should consider exceptions on a case by case base
09:22	LaserJock	ok, that's sort of what I was thinking
09:23	LaserJock	so far calculators are the only ones I've run into
09:23	willvdl	LaserJock, I'm not familiar with the packages but I woudl assume it's OK if one=primary and the other=secondary
09:23	ogra	i'm all for replacing the gnome default calculator for example ...
09:23	ogra	that leaves us with only one additional app ;)
09:24	LaserJock	ogra: ok, so what is your feeling on me doing some more MIRs?
09:24	ogra	since i expect at least one of them can work like a standard calculator
09:24	LaserJock	I asked -devel if FF applied to these 2nd CD apps
09:24	LaserJock	and they said it was basically up to you
09:24	ogra	LaserJock, itz wont hurt ... if we dont get them in we still have MIRs we only need to update
09:24	LaserJock	ok
09:25	ogra	concentrate on the ones with the lest deps
09:25	LaserJock	I'll continue working on them, and hopefully at a much more rapid pace
09:25	ogra	*least
09:25	LaserJock	yeah
09:25	LaserJock	that's why I started with rasmol
09:25	LaserJock	rasmol, lybniz, and qcad don't need any deps from Universe
09:25	ogra	great
09:26	LaserJock	octave is one that has a few
09:26	LaserJock	but in my  thread on the forums it comes up a lot
09:26	LaserJock	as the best free Matlab replacement
09:26	ogra	is drgeo in main ?
09:26	LaserJock	but it needs lam, mpich, hdf5, gnuplot, libgd
09:26	LaserJock	no
09:26	ogra	its an often requested app
09:26	LaserJock	and it's upstream is dead so I didn't know if we could do a MIR or not
09:27	juliux	octave is the beste math tool i ever used
09:27	ogra	drgeo ?
09:27	ogra	hmm, that ssad
09:27	LaserJock	yeah, Burgwork found it for me
09:27	willvdl	octave upstream dead?
09:27	LaserJock	not octave, drgeo
09:27	willvdl	ah
09:27	LaserJock	drgeo really looks like a good app
09:28	ogra	yeah, but nothing for now ...
09:28	LaserJock	anyway
09:28	LaserJock	I've been digging around
09:28	LaserJock	trying to see which ones are worth it, etc.
09:28	LaserJock	and I'm almost done with rasmol
09:28	ogra	good
09:28	LaserJock	but I should have more up by the end of the week
09:29	LaserJock	I got some gchemutils work out of the way last night
09:29	ogra	i'll kick kdeedu and gcompris off the CD on friday then ...
09:29	ogra	and have a look around main for apps we could use
09:29	LaserJock	oh, and I talked with jono about jokosher
09:29	LaserJock	I don't know if I mentioned it to you ogra
09:30	willvdl	intersting angle
09:30	ogra	yep you did
09:30	LaserJock	k
09:30	ogra	inkscape looks like a good one ...
09:30	LaserJock	yeah
09:30	LaserJock	I'll go through Main too, I hadn't really thought about that
09:30	ogra	with the free space we can finally ship mono ...  how about f-spot by default ?
09:31	ogra	*f-spot
09:31	willvdl	interesting, these are not what one "traditionally" lumps into educational tools?
09:31	LaserJock	willvdl: it's still a computer :-)
09:31	LaserJock	I think f-spot would be good
09:31	LaserJock	tomboy too
09:31	LaserJock	as students can keep notes
09:31	ogra	willvdl, well, an app for vector drawing should be a standard
09:32	ogra	we ship gimp for pixel pushing ... so we can as well grab inkscape :)
09:32	willvdl	ogra, it should be in main as DTP app...
09:32	ogra	inkscape is in main
09:32	ogra	it's just not on any CDs yet
09:32	willvdl	ah. there we go. gotcha
09:32	LaserJock	is there an easy way to see what's in Main but not on the CDs?
09:33	ogra	there are a bunch of such apps, i need to dig through that ...
09:33	ogra	the seeds ...
09:33	ogra	and germinate should be able to help you as well
09:33	LaserJock	well, I could grab the Packages.gz from Main and subtract out what's in the seeds
09:33	ogra	right
09:34	LaserJock	I'm sure Pete could write something ;-)
09:34	ogra	heh
09:34	LaserJock	he wrote me a little script to check the deps
09:34	LaserJock	for MIRs
09:34	ogra	i'll need him for the TCM fixes ....
09:34	LaserJock	:-)
09:34	ogra	so dont put to much on hi,
09:34	LaserJock	how's TCM going?
09:34	ogra	*him
09:34	LaserJock	I won't I promise?
09:34	ogra	i fixed the final glitches with the package today
09:34	LaserJock	s/?/:-)/
09:35	LaserJock	sounds like big improvments since SCP
09:35	ogra	the vnc part on my side is missing ... but thats a trivial one ...
09:35	LaserJock	I haven't had a chance to use it as I don't have an LTSP setup
09:35	LaserJock	but the screenshots look pretty cool
09:35	ogra	will be fixed with the next ltsp upload i think
09:35	juliux	ogra, is there a working TCM in herd4?
09:35	ogra	juliux, kind of
09:35	ogra	all old features will work ...
09:36	ogra	there were no regressions ...
09:36	juliux	and the new ones also?
09:36	ogra	the new features still all have bugs
09:36	juliux	ok
09:36	ogra	but try them out and file them please :)
09:36	ogra	so we get a list together
09:36	juliux	we will do
09:36	willvdl	is TCM registered on Malone?
09:36	ogra	great :)
09:36	juliux	we have the whole sunday for testing,)
09:37	ogra	willvdl, only the package i think ... not sure pete has an LP branch for it
09:37	willvdl	so no bzr branch, but can catch bugs
09:37	ogra	as long as we're only two devs its fine to play pingpong with the source package
09:38	ogra	but it should have a branch indeed
09:38	ogra	i'll talk to pete about that
09:38	willvdl	not really, maybe as it's released
09:38	ogra	oh, one other thing ... if you test, please give feedback about the new usplash :)
09:39	juliux	ogra, ok
09:39	willvdl	got a snpashot?
09:39	ogra	kwwii made us aa new one :)
09:39	willvdl	snapshot rather?
09:39	ogra	not of a running one, but i can upload the pic, one moment
09:40	willvdl	coool
09:41	LaserJock	is the other artwork new yet?
09:41	ogra	http://people.ubuntu.com/~ogra/usplash_1024_768.png
09:41	ogra	nope, not yet
09:41	LaserJock	k, I just wondered
09:42	LaserJock	hmm, I like the usplash
09:42	juliux	nice usplash
09:42	ogra	ken will develop an ubuntu theme weher we will just apply color changes as i understoofd his plan
09:42	LaserJock	the lettering looks a little too "fuzzy" for me but I love the logo
09:42	ogra	i'm currently hacking on svg support for ldm ...
09:42	LaserJock	doh
09:42	ogra	LaserJock, you need to scale it right :)
09:43	willvdl	LaserJock, zoom in
09:43	LaserJock	I just needed to get it at 100%, my browser was shrinking it
09:43	willvdl	as you mentioned it, I thought the same thing :)
09:43	LaserJock	ok, yeah, I really like it
09:43	willvdl	snap
09:43	ogra	we have a nice redish progressbar for that ...
09:43	willvdl	same style?
09:44	ogra	same style as ubuntu
09:44	ogra	just a different color
09:44	willvdl	I'm not mad about the 6.10 progress bar
09:44	ogra	test the herd4 liveCD :P
09:44	ogra	there you can see it in action
09:44	willvdl	ogra, I wish. bandwidth is a commodity here :)
09:45	LaserJock	willvdl: I didn't like it either
09:45	willvdl	fortunately I sit next to marilize so I can steal CDs :)
09:45	ogra	willvdl, you should get a cdimage mirror to the hbd office ...
09:45	ogra	rsyncs are cheaper than downnloads
09:45	willvdl	ogra, there is one but that's another story. perhaps not in here :)
09:45	ogra	ok :)
09:46	willvdl	I guess we're in artwork?
09:46	ogra	well, i guess that was artwork
09:46	ogra	unless someone else has anything to show :)
09:47	ogra	i'll talk to colin after herd4 if we can get the usplash pic into the CD bootscreen as well
09:47	willvdl	is that guy on https://wiki.edubuntu.org/EdubuntuArtwork/Palette modelled on Pete? :)
09:47	ogra	that urgently needs an update
09:48	ogra	thats from pete and his wife afaik
09:48	willvdl	looks a bit like him. if you squint jsut right
09:48	willvdl	ogra, I presume the motd thingy will wait a bit?
09:49	ogra	i'll look into it ... might be only a trivial confiog switch in gdm
09:49	ogra	if not it has to wait, yes
09:49	ogra	really depends how big that change might be
09:50	willvdl	the icons that get shipped, how are they genrally licensed?
09:50	ogra	i think they are gpl ...
09:50	ogra	not the best for icons
09:51	ogra	let me look it up ... one sec
09:51	ogra	the debian package says GPL
09:52	willvdl	so if I reuse on the wiki and the wiki is CC-BY-SA...
09:53	ogra	F.A.Q:
09:53	ogra	Q: What's Gartoon License?
09:53	ogra	A: Starting 0.5 Gartoon lincensed under GPL (read GPL.txt)
09:53	ogra	aha
09:54	willvdl	I should then just make a reference/attribution where I reuse
=== LaserJock loves licensing :-) *cough*
09:54	willvdl	e.g. https://wiki.edubuntu.org/Edubuntu?action=show
09:56	willvdl	anyhoo, above link is not "live" yet but is the culmination of work I've done trying to cleanup and organise our wiki pages
09:56	willvdl	I think I need a "misc" section though
09:57	LaserJock	I think nixternal is getting the edubuntu-docs MIR written up
09:57	ogra	yippie
09:58	LaserJock	we have a few bugs to work out in the yelp frontpage
09:58	willvdl	now we jsut need to get the edubuntu-docs written up :)
09:58	LaserJock	but mdke said he'll work on that
09:58	ogra	i thought there is a lot
09:58	LaserJock	we dep on ubuntu-docs
09:58	willvdl	just kidding
09:58	ogra	we just need them imported into the package
09:58	LaserJock	so people will get all the Ubuntu documentation
09:59	willvdl	LaserJock, I can't wait to see the end result cause then I reckon I'll finally get my head around the technicalities of TBH
09:59	LaserJock	so the "bug" we need to fix is to remove About Ubuntu
09:59	LaserJock	well, it'll be interesting
10:00	LaserJock	but at least better than what we've had in the past
10:00	willvdl	one option is to make the "About" page generic to all derivitives
10:00	LaserJock	I think Feisty+1 will be more consistent
10:01	willvdl	which could possibly make sense... less duplication on common features
10:02	nixternal	LaserJock: I am looking at the MIR now, sorry but I have been so bogged down this week
10:02	nixternal	Availability:  Not yet?
10:02	LaserJock	the package *is* in Universe
10:02	LaserJock	just not the final form
10:03	ogra	ogra@edubuntu:~/packages/gartoon-0.5$ apt-cache madison edubuntu-docs
10:03	ogra	edubuntu-docs |      0.4-1 | http://de.archive.ubuntu.com feisty/universe Packages
10:03	ogra	edubuntu-docs |      0.4-1 | http://archive.ubuntu.com feisty/universe Sources
10:03	ogra	if you need any repackaging etc, ping me
10:03	LaserJock	I had a look at nixternal's packaging
10:03	ogra	currently it installs two html files without any integration ...
10:03	LaserJock	built and installed it too
10:04	ogra	i'm fine with replacing whats there
10:04	LaserJock	it seems good, it's based off of the ubuntu-docs source package
10:04	ogra	LaserJock, if ayou are fine with the package feel free to upload
10:04	LaserJock	nixternal: we should check the firefox page though
10:04	LaserJock	ogra: k
10:04	ogra	the firefox page is in edubuntu-artwork
10:04	ogra	please check for other clashes as well
10:05	nixternal	LaserJock: yes, I will work on that unless you want to rock it out quickly
10:05	nixternal	LaserJock: whoa whoa
10:05	LaserJock	nixternal: what?
10:05	nixternal	LaserJock: the Firefox page is packaged with edubuntu-artwork
10:06	nixternal	so you need to fix it there, unless it gets removed from there and incorporated into the edubuntu-docs package, which of course only makes sense
10:06	ogra	its the only doc we have, it didnt really justify a whole package ...
10:06	LaserJock	nah, -artwork is fine for now
10:06	LaserJock	I don't want to "rock the boat" too much at this point
10:06	ogra	well, it should move eventually ...
10:07	ogra	but that must not be now if it generates extra work
10:07	LaserJock	anyway, we can talk details later
10:07	ogra	really up to you guys ... i'll do what the docteam says ;)
10:07	LaserJock	we need a MIR and get it going
10:07	ogra	right
10:07	LaserJock	we can fix bugs a bit later
10:08	ogra	just wipe the existing package with something with a higher version
10:08	nixternal	LaserJock / ogra: we can always start out feisty+1 with the new implementation to save issues?
10:08	ogra	as long as we keep a working upgrade path we can do everything ;)
10:08	nixternal	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MainInclusionReportEdubuntuDocs <- LaserJock
10:08	nixternal	oh shoot, I forgot that we were in a meeting right now :) I just connected from school
10:09	nixternal	haha, I thought we were in #*-motu
10:09	ogra	well, i dont think there is much left oin the plate for the meeting
10:09	nixternal	LaserJock: that MIR is rough, but started :)
10:09	LaserJock	nixternal: I can tweak it when you're done :-)
10:10	nixternal	I am done for the time being if you want to tweak it a little
10:10	ogra	so we could as well end it here and you can go on with packaging in #edubuntu :)
10:10	nixternal	that is the first time I have done one, so I am expecting it to be horrible
10:11	ogra	well, its our own package so there wont be any external CVEs or something ...
10:11	nixternal	true
10:11	ogra	and its only docs
10:11	nixternal	ya, how dangerous can they be :)
10:11	ogra	i dont expect problems with the MIR
10:11	nixternal	oh wait, I have been working on them, so be careful ;p
10:11	ogra	ujnless iwj complains about the format ...
10:12	nixternal	sure, whatever that means
=== nixternal whips out a perl script to decypher
10:12	ogra	make sure to not use the plain template ... but put some formulation work in etc
10:12	ogra	he wants to see some effort from a MIR writer
10:12	nixternal	ahh
10:12	ogra	so you show your intrest in the package
10:13	ogra	(thats how he said it )
10:13	nixternal	very well put I must say
10:13	nixternal	gotta sell it!
10:13	ogra	heh
10:14	willvdl	stelis, are you in here?
10:14	stelis	Yes
10:14	willvdl	can you paste the link to the docs you're working on in here?
10:14	willvdl	I lost it in my logs
10:14	stelis	http://www.elsn.org/downloads/edubuntu/drafts/edubuntu-quickstart.html
10:15	willvdl	thanks. sorry for the noise folks but I want to start integrating more from other peoples docs
10:15	nixternal	stelis: you think that your docs could be incorporated into the current Edubuntu Handbook?
10:15	nixternal	willvdl: I take it you are on it already :)
10:15	willvdl	nixternal, time :)
10:16	nixternal	woohoo, one less thing for me to worry over right now
10:16	willvdl	but if things don't go according to pplan then I will have next week relatively free
10:16	stelis	I'm not actually sure where the current HB is
10:16	ogra	instead of https://wiki.edubuntu.com/EdubuntuLtsConfParams you should rather point to /opt/ltsp/i386/usr/share/doc/ltsp-client/examples/lts-parameters.txt.gz that will have always the recent supported list
10:16	ogra	stelis, ^^
10:16	stelis	I pulled a SVN before Xmas
10:16	willvdl	https://wiki.edubuntu.org/Edubuntu/Documentation/Handbook
10:16	stelis	ogra: Thanks
10:17	nixternal	stelis: the docs are stored at https://docteam.ubuntu.com/repos/trunk
10:17	ogra	apart from that this is a really beautiful doc, kudos
10:17	stelis	Thanks
10:17	nixternal	more info can be found at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DocumentationTeam/Repository
10:17	stelis	FWIW, the idea was to have a stopgap until there is a HB
10:17	nixternal	stelis: yes, it is an awesome doc, and just what we needed! As it stands, this makes the handbook almost complete, then you are my new HERO!
10:18	nixternal	hell, all the work you put into it, you are my hero :)
10:18	stelis	I guess it depends how comprehensive you want your HB to be
10:19	willvdl	stelis, as comprehensive as possible
10:19	nixternal	stelis: we shall leave that up to willvdl, I am just a docmonkey
10:19	willvdl	as as many audience as possible.
10:19	willvdl	v. ambitious
10:19	stelis	This Quickstart is enough to get somebody going
10:19	nixternal	they feed me bananas and I type, quite horribly I might add
10:19	stelis	The text is complete enough as is
10:19	stelis	Bananas are good :)
10:19	willvdl	nixternal, as long as you can fix my broken links I'm happy
10:19	nixternal	willvdl: what broken links?
10:20	willvdl	you'll see
10:20	nixternal	lol
10:20	willvdl	my docbook is still rusty and frayed
10:20	nixternal	ahh
10:20	willvdl	stelis, I wanted to this week but hopefully next week I can dedicate hours to integrating your stuff
10:21	stelis	OK.
10:21	willvdl	now that I've got the wiki under wraps
10:21	stelis	FWIW, this works as a standalone
10:21	stelis	So you could just add screenshots
10:22	stelis	I'm conscious that time is short
10:23	stelis	But feel free to use it as you need
10:23	stelis	There's some other pieces in the same directory
10:23	willvdl	stelis, thanks to you we now have options
10:23	stelis	I don't have lots of time myself
10:24	willvdl	I will, hopefully, up until march
10:24	stelis	But I could write up some Release Notes or a few sections of this and that
=== ogra looks up "lots of time" in his dictionary
10:25	willvdl	nixternal, who normally does our finals for the release notes?
10:25	nixternal	willvdl: dunno, but I can probably work something out for you since I do the Kubuntu ones
10:26	willvdl	I got very confused with the old releases: there where wiki versions, docbook ones, release notes, install notes, release announcements...
10:27	willvdl	ogra, clearly you have enough time to do that :)
10:27	ogra	:P
10:29	willvdl	ok, cool. I'll work something out with stelis and find a path of least resistance
10:31	willvdl	shall we wrap up?
10:31	ogra	yeah
10:31	willvdl	just want to punt my mockup for https://wiki.edubuntu.org/Edubuntu?action=show again
10:31	willvdl	shamelessly :)
10:31	willvdl	I will work on maing it easier and easier to read as we go
=== ogra does the same with http://wiki.ubuntu.com/UES-Sevilla :)
10:32	willvdl	something like henrik's testing page
10:32	ogra	yep
10:32	ogra	ok, any other business ?
10:32	willvdl	and since we normally end with community: UES Sevilla!!!
10:32	ogra	going once
10:32	ogra	going twice
10:32	ogra	COME TO SEVILLA !!!!
10:33	ogra	adjourned !
