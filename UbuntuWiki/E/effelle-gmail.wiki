__TOC__

== Federico Leoni ==
I am a 41 years old Italian guy born in Assisi but now I'm living in a beautiful city called Porto Alegre in Brasil.
I am a linux enthusiast since 2006 and a proud, successfully detoxified from windows since earlier 2007. 

=== Why using *buntu? ===
Why not? I prefer Lubuntu over the other flavors, I like the speed!

=== Why a challenge? ===
Because without a challenge life is boring... 

=== Life Goals ===
Many! Someone also linked to the Linux world, but mainly about my life as a human being. Here in Brasil I learned that we live too fast. I need to slow down a bit more to be happy. Now that my second daughter is born I want to spent more time with my sons.

=== And now? ===
I'm trying to help Lubuntu to grow up. Because he deserves it.
