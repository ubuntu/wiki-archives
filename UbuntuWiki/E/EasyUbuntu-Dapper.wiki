=== Summary ===
Spec for EasyUbuntu on Dapper, this page also lists possible improvements (packagewise) to EasyUbuntu for Dapper. 

=== Rationale ===
People will inevitably want to use EasyUbuntu on Dapper. However, we want to retain backward compatibility with Breezy.

=== Design ===
* An xml file containing the list of packages and configuration commands is present in the pkglist-release-arch.xml format, containing the different packages and  configuration commands. EU will read and load a gui, and execute them based on the xml file 

=== Implementation ===

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| Detect whether breezy/dapper system (lsb-release -c)
| (./)
|-
| Detect the architecture
| (./)
|-
| Read the packagelist file appropriate file
| (./)
|-
| Load gui based on the file
| (./)
|}

==== Code ====
* Initial Working Implementation is available in branches/eudeb

=== Outstanding issues ===
* To handle translations from xml files, hopefully gui translations are automatic
