__TOC__

== Introduction ==
Edgy, all about cutting edge, perhaps bleeding edge, will consist of brand new code and infrastructure. The time has come to introduce some seriously interesting, but definitely edgy, new technologies that lay the groundwork for the next wave of Ubuntu development.

Knot CD 2 is the second in a series of milestone CD images that will be released throughout the Edgy development cycle as images known to be reasonably free of CD-build or installer bugs. They represent very current snapshots of Edgy. Kubuntu Edgy Knot releases can be downloaded from the following URL:
* http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/releases/edgy/knot-2/

'''NOTE:''' ''This is an alpha (pre-) release. Pre-release versions of Edgy are '''__NOT__''' encouraged for anyone needing a stable system or not comfortable running into occasional, even frequent, breakage. Pre-release versions of Edgy '''__ARE__''' recommended for Ubuntu developers and those who want to help in testing, reporting, and fixing bugs.''

Edgy Eft has many new, bleeding edge applications and technologies that are designed to be the framework of future Kubuntu releases. With every new Knot release, there will be many new and exciting features. The following features will be present in the Kubuntu Edgy Eft Knot 2 release. Remember that all of these features are part of a pre-release version of Kubuntu, and may still have issues. We ask that any problems you come across, file a bug, if one has yet to be filed for your problem.<<BR>>

=== System Settings Layout ===
'''''Kmenu -> System Settings'''''<<BR>>
'''Info:''' http://www.kdedevelopers.org/node/2220

As you can see from the following images, the System Settings layout has been modified a bit, making it cleaner, and easier to use in this release of Edgy Eft. The layout right now is temporary, as the minor layout bugs are known and are currently being reworked.

=== Easy Zeroconf Tickbox ===
'''''Kmenu -> System Settings -> Networking -> Zeroconf'''''<<BR>>
'''Info:''' https://wiki.kubuntu.org/KubuntuEasyZeroconf

Zero Configuration Networking, aka Zeroconf, is a method of establishing a connection between computers, allowing them to communicate and in turn sharing each others resources. Zeroconf was created to simplify networking by removing the complexity of the configuration process. Kubuntu Edgy Eft now has the ability to enable Zeroconf just by toggling the tick box.

~-The following image displays the Zero Configuration tick box, which enables Zero Configuration in Kubuntu.-~<<BR>>

'''Feedback:''' https://wiki.kubuntu.org/KubuntuPowerManagementFeedback

'''''Guidance Power Manager''''', the power management application for Kubuntu, is a fairly simple front-end to HAL's power management features. The Guidance Power Manager replaces the aging klaptopdaemon. There are some notable issues that are still being worked on.

=== Laptop Buttons Support ===
'''Spec:''' https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+spec/kubuntu-laptop-buttons <<BR>>
'''Info:''' https://wiki.kubuntu.org/KubuntuLaptopButtons

Many laptops and desktops feature buttons, or hotkeys, that handle power management, display controls, volume controls, and other features that currently work for most Kubuntu users. The developers would greatly appreciate your feedback by attaching your comments to the bottom of https://wiki.kubuntu.org/KubuntuLaptopButtons under the '''Comments''' section. If you are experiencing problems with button support, please file a bug at https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/kmilo/+filebug. Make sure you let us know your Laptop Make and Model. Also, check out https://wiki.kubuntu.org/LaptopTestingTeam for laptop-specific information and testing as well as links.

The following two screen shots show off the button use by displaying the KMix OSD for Volume and Muting. The OSD pop-ups are planned to be reworked for a better layout and look.

Currently Launchpad Integration consists of "Help and Support Options" as well as "Rosetta Translations", both of which we are working to complete. However, the basics are there, so continue to check for future updates.

=== OpenOffice.org 2.0.3 ===
'''''KMenu -> Office'''''<<BR>>
'''Info:''' http://development.openoffice.org/releases/2.0.3.html

This new version of Open``Office``.org is mainly a bug- and security-fix. There are 3 security vulnerabilities that were fixed with this update. Briefly, they are:
* The Sandbox in which Java applets are executed allowed applets to break out of the secure environment to create, overwrite, or destroy files using the user's privileges.
* Macros could be embedded in affected documents, which once opened, executed without launching a query.
* Malicious code could be executed by exploiting a buffer overflow in the processing of malformed XMS documents.
According to developers, none of these vulnerabilities have been actively exploited and were instead found during an internal code review.
