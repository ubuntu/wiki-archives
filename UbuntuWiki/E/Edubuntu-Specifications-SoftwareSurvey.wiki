=== Summary ===
The <nowiki>[[EdubuntuSoftwareSurvey]]</nowiki> aims to provide an on-line survey for teachers, parents and students to help determine the educational software needs for Edubuntu. In addition, the Edubuntu Software Survey seeks to grow Edubuntu usage by periodically reporting results to participants and content developers.. 

=== Rationale ===
Educators and parents evaluating Edubuntu for their students and children will demand a comprehensive selection of high-quality educational software. The current selection of software in Edubuntu does not satisfy this need.
 
Developing a K-12 software library in Reading/Language Arts, Mathematics, Science and Social Studies for Edubuntu is a monumental undertaking. This project proposes to begin that development effort by asking teachers, parents and students where we should concentrate first.

=== Use cases ===
* Mary, a school board member, looks for innovative ways to reduce district educational software costs. At a monthly meeting, she announces that Edubuntu may provide a long-term solution for her district and others as well. An e-mail is sent to all teachers in the district asking them to fill out the Edubuntu Software Survey. 35% of the teachers complete the survey. David, a Spanish teacher from the district wants to contribute to the effort and joins the Edubuntu team.

* Jordan, is a programmer seeking to develop a new application for The <nowiki>[[http://edu.kde.org|KDE Edutainment]]</nowiki> Project. He views the Edubuntu Software Survey results and notices a high degree of interest for science software, specifically related to middle-school biology. He decides to construct a "Frog Dissection Simulator". <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/people/edubuntu-study-content|EdubuntuStudyContent]]</nowiki> team members are brought together to help design learning objectives, a user interface, and content for the project.

=== Scope ===

=== Survey Design ===
Many people are considering the idea of switching to Linux in their schools based on cost savings, but find key applications not available on Linux. The Edubuntu community and the volunteers who create software need to hear about your needs.

That's where we come in. The Edubuntu Study Content Team is committed to help: 

* create new content both for teachers and students, 
* create content for training courses, 
* to design courses syllabus,
* to analyze different tools people can use for teaching/studying purposes.

If you have any critical, subject-area specific, applications that you MUST be able to use on Linux for educational purposes, please take a minute to let us know what they are. We'll monitor the submissions to see what the most popular requests are, and do what we can to lead developments in that direction. Together, your voices will count for more than they would separately.

Thank you for helping us grow the Educational Linux marketplace!
