__TOC__

My name is Eric Sather, I'm a fairly new user to Ubuntu(and linux in general) but I have learned pretty fast and enjoyed   
every bit of it. I don't have a extensive knowledge of programming, but I'm willing to learn.   

I'm intrested in any area that I can help, but the program I know the most about(and would like to know more about) is Google Chrome/Chromium 

The time I'm most available is between 1900 to 2330 UTC 

I am in timezone CDT which is UTC -5 HRs
