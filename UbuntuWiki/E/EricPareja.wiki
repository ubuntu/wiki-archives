__TOC__

=== Eric Pareja ===

My primary contributions are in translation work for Tagalog in upstream Debian and in Ubuntu itself via launchpad.
I participate in the Ubuntu Local Community for the Philippines.

I'll add Wiki Links to these items later.

I plan on continuing to work in the translation sphere primarily, though I can do packaging work as well (I maintain the kxstitch package for Debian).
