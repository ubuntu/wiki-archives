This project is going to be big, and require some real work.  We will be installing and supporting an Ubuntu Network for the <nowiki>[[http://www.endorphinpower.org|The Endorphin Power Company]]</nowiki>

This project was started on October 1st, 2007, due to the generous donation of 25 computers to the The Endorphin Power Company by Charter Bank of Albuquerque, New Mexico.  The New Mexico Ubuntu LoCo is in the process of installing the Ubuntu operating system on the donated computers, as well as negotiating a service level agreement to provide limited support and training for The Endorphin Power Company.

===== EPC Project Updates =====

Sam Slishman from EPC has picked up the PC's.  Final total was 23 PC's, 1 Dell PowerEdge 4400, and 2 3Com 10/100 Sweitches.  Talking with Sam to see how the Ubuntu NM LoCo can help.  Here's and email from Sam...

Wow Eric,

I feel like we've just walked into another realm of possibilities.
We have a number of interest groups at EPC and I'd like to see one start up that is focused on the IT topics that you all seem to love.

Initially the focus could be on setting up the network, but eventually maybe it could evolve into computing/resume writing/finance classes for future residents. Plenty of other ideas too.
Perhaps you and your Ubuntu Loco friends might like to have a meeting at the building some time at your convenience? I'll cc a few more folks who I think might also like to participate.

Thanks again so much Eric.

I'm looking forward to learning a lot here as well.

Sam from EPC is out of the country to middle of this week.  Discussed
getting help on setting up PCs and support for them once we get things
rolling.  There seemed to be alot of interest and offers to help out.  I
also mentioned that Charter Bank is getting on to a 6 month plan.  every
6 months we will be evaluating what we have in inventory are donating as
much as we can to 501c's.  This will not be limited to PC's but
switches, servers, racks, etc.  As of right now I have 23 PC's (13
gx240's and 10 GX110's) that are ready to have Xorg reconfigured for the
monitor attached to it.  After testing there are only 10 good monitors
so we have some extra PC's in the even that one dies or we could turn a
few into servers.  So for now I'm waiting for Sam to get back into town
to arrange pickup and further discuss SLA (service Level Agreement).

All PC's have been imaged and are ready for pickup EPC has been notified and are coordinating a time. Again A HUGE thanks to Ubuntu Member <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/GrammatonCleric|Eric Krieger]]</nowiki> for all his hard work on this project.
