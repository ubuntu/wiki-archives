=== Summary ===
Currently we use Synaptic to tell people how to install things. We need to evaluate using GAI for some stuff. It is also possibly that Synaptic might be hidden in Dapper.

=== Rationale ===

We use synaptic, but it is not great. GAI has some nasty corner cases, but has a much simpler interface.

=== Use cases ===

=== Scope ===

All ubuntu docs

=== Design ===

=== Implementation ===

==== Code ====

==== Data preservation and migration ====

=== Outstanding issues ===

* We need a way to install packages that are not listed in Gnome-App-Install. Even just a dialog box where we can enter the package names would be helpful, or an advanced mode that looks more like Synaptic. Other wise users will have to resort to apt-get if Synaptic is hidden which would be a backwards step.
