__TOC__

''Please check the status of this specification in Launchpad before editing it.  If it is Approved, contact the Assignee or another knowledgeable person before making changes.''

* '''Launchpad Entry''': UbuntuSpec:classmatepc-anti-theft
* '''Packages affected''': Edubuntu for the Intel ClassmatePC

=== Summary ===

The Intel ClassmatePC can be set up to have a "limited roam time" away from the network. Once this roam time is exceeded without a "return visit" the device locks itself and disables use.

This is available under:
* MS Windows version
* Linux version ( MetaSys )

This must be adapted to run on the Ubuntu version.

Requires the driver and application and technical outline from Intel.

=== Release Note ===

* New requirement.
* Device specific.
* Edubuntu for the ClassmatePC specific.
* No impact on existing users of any previous Ubuntu version.

=== Rationale ===

There is a requirement for Edubuntu to match the functionality of the existing software versions.

=== Use Cases ===

* This software will provide the functionality required to ensure that a ClassmatePC cannot be permanently removed from its home environment.
* To be expanded after Intel response.

=== Assumptions ===

* To follow after Intel response has been considered.

=== Design ===

* Requires the driver from Intel.
** '''Action:''' RichEd to requestfrom Intel
** '''Status:''' Intel have responded that it is being sourced. (22/11/2007)

* Requires the application from Intel.
** '''Action:''' RichEd to requestfrom Intel
** '''Status:''' Intel have responded that it is being sourced. (22/11/2007)

* Requires technical outline from Intel.
** '''Action:''' RichEd to requestfrom Intel

=== Implementation ===

This section will follow when the design section is completed. 

==== UI Changes ====

Will cover changes required to the UI, or specific UI that is required to implement this.

==== Code Changes ====

Will include an overview of what code needs to change, and any specific details required.

==== Migration ====

None.

=== Test/Demo Plan ===

It's important that we are able to test new features, and demonstrate them to users.  Use this section to describe a short plan that anybody can follow that demonstrates the feature is working.  This can then be used during CD testing, and to show off after release.

This need not be added or completed until the specification is nearing beta.

=== Outstanding Issues ===

* Requires driver from Intel.
* Requires application from Intel.
* Requires technical outline from Intel.
* Requires analysis following response.

=== BoF agenda and discussion ===

* Raised the requirements that need to be supplied by Intel with Jason Scott.
