__TOC__

I have spent many years dedicated to the Mac platform.  Recently I became familiar with Windows on a day-to-day basis, and was not at all impressed.  Somewhere along the line I tripped over Ubuntu and saw the Light.  I remember dabbling in Linux back in the late nineties, and it scared both me and my Mac.  Now it is a totally different ballgame.  I have always been a supporter of open source, and the freedom to share and participate.  I am also now totally jacked off with being forced to upgrade hardware on a regular basis to keep up with the "improvements" in the OS's.  So now my Mac B&W G3 and IBM Aptiva P3, both from 1999, are happily whirring away on Ubuntu 6.06 and in tune with their digital environment.  

My only problem now is laying my hands on a few more computers, so that I can try out Ubuntu_Studio, or Edubuntu, or maybe Xubuntu.  Maybe I should upgrade to 8.04, but hey, Puppy_Linux looks interesting, and then there's ...........well, you get the picture.
