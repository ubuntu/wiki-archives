'''Plans:'''
* I want to continue contributing both as a moderator at the Greek Ubuntu Community forum (<nowiki>[[http://forum.ubuntu-gr.org/index.php]]</nowiki>) and as a translator in launchpad. 
* I plan to become more active in the local Ioannina Linux User Group (ILUG)

'''Self-remarks:'''
I have been introduced to ubuntu by a friend after much arguing. I started with 7.10 and a year later I got seriously involved in the Greek Community forum, where I eventually (2010) became a moderator. In 2009 I got involved in translations in launchpad. I strive to help out members with problems as much as I can.
