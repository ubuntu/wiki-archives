Considering this article is about networking, especially setting up a DHCP server, this article may be crucial to setting up internal managed networks. An especially important part of the article is the setup of a wireless network, because execution of the instructions regarding the setup of a wireless network result in failure. This may actually also be a bug that could actually be part of the linux kernel 80211 module. Therefore if the directions cannot actually be rewritten due to a possible bug, developer teams can be notified immediately to rectify the issue.

The <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Router|Router|target="_blank"]]</nowiki> article explains how to set up a fairly advanced networking configuration that can be highly useful. This includes (but is not limited to) the setup of a DHCP server, a wired network, a wireless network, and a network bridge between the wired and wireless networks.
