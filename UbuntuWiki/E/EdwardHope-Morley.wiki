== About Me ==

I have been using Ubuntu for many years and am now a fledgling Ubuntu contributor. My background has mostly been Linux driver maintenance and Openstack development which I am now helping to support for Ubuntu. My activities include Openstack development, mostly of storage related services, as well as fixing bugs, reviewing upstream patches and making them available in stable releases through the SRU process.
