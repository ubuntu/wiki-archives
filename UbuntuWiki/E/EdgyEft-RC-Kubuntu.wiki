== Introduction ==
Edgy, all about cutting edge, perhaps bleeding edge, will consist of brand new code and infrastructure. The time has come to introduce some seriously interesting, but definitely edgy, new technologies that lay the groundwork for the next wave of Ubuntu development.

Release Candidate 1 is the fifth, and final in a series of milestone CD images that will be released throughout the Edgy development cycle as images known to be reasonably free of CD-build or installer bugs.

Some features include, but are not limited to:
* Serial, USB, USB/IEEE Mass storage connection
* Organization of photos in albums and sub-albums
* Comments, tags, classifications, sorting, drag and drop

=== Accessibility Profiles ===
'''Info:''' https://wiki.kubuntu.org/KubuntuAccessibility <<BR>>

The Ubuntu accessibility team has been hard at work creating amazing accessibility options, which are now available during an installation. When you boot from a LiveCD or an Alternate CD, at the ''Start or install Kubuntu'' splash, pressing ''F5'' will pop up the accessibility boot options such as:
* High Contrast
* Magnifier
* Keyboard Modifiers
Quoting Henrik Omma, "''The FOSS world prides itself on providing choice. Different desktop environments, different kernels, different distros. We think that users of assistive technology should have those choices too''." For more information on accessibility as it stands, please review the post on "''henrik's blog''," http://blog.omma.net/?p=18
