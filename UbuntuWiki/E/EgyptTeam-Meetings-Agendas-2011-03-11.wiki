== Conclusion ==
Since most of the expected instructors didn't come to the meeting, the meeting took a different path than the expected one.

*** Basic outline was built for Joomla course. Further details are being handled by Jonathan and Anas.
*** Toulan will be responsible for the whole Python course. Python Blender gaming won't be part of the course, but a bonus session or something like that. Django web framework will be added to the courses list.
*** Anas will prepare course content for Inkscape.
*** Qt course will be postponed for now.
*** Islam Alwazery will review Ubuntu design guidelines to update our logo.
*** Islam Alwazery will investigate exporting from Blender to Flash, so we will be able to share a small artistic slide show of our courses on our website.
*** A new installation of our website is being built with Drupal 7.
