=== How to start the Desktop CD in a safe graphics mode ===
<nowiki>[[File:cdboot.png]]</nowiki>

At the cd boot prompt menu, press F6 to edit kernel options.

Remove <code>splash</code> and add <code>break=bottom</code>.

<nowiki>[[File:boot-options.png]]</nowiki>

Press Enter to start the kernel.
After a while you will get a prompt (initramfs). Enter
<pre>
chroot /root nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
</pre>
<nowiki>[[File:nano-cmdline.png]]</nowiki>

Find the "Device" section and change the <code>Driver</code> to "vesa". You can jump to the right place by searching: ctrl-W <code>Section "Device"</code> Enter
<pre>
    Driver   "vesa"
</pre>

Save and quit the editor with ctrl-O ctrl-X.
Type "exit" or ctrl-D to exit the shell and continue booting.

An alternative that works for some people is to simply delete xorg.conf, and let the X server use default settings. For this, enter at the (initramfs) prompt:
<pre>
chroot /root rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf
</pre>
and continue booting with ctrl-D.

==== After installation ====
If you use the Desktop CD to install Ubuntu to your hard drive, it will (in some cases, this has been reported in Dapper, but I have seen the opposite in Edgy) copy all extra boot parameters (that you added when booting the CD) to your grub configuration so that they will be used every time you boot. Therefore, after installation, edit <code>/boot/grub/menu.lst</code> and make sure there is no <code>break=bottom</code> on the <code># defoptions=</code> line:
<pre>
sudo nano +86 /boot/grub/menu.lst
</pre>

==== Comments ====
Thanks to ''robepisc'' (and <code>qemu</code>) for the screenshots!
