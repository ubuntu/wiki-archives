Jan 24 20:06:11 <PWill> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/OhioTeam/WebTeam
Jan 24 20:07:42 <theidiotthatisme> I've also updated the CD Team wiki page and created the Education Team wiki page
Jan 24 20:08:37 * meatballhat asks for everyone's patience as he is smack in the middle of learning Dvorak :-P
Jan 24 20:09:42 * meatballhat knows *just* enough Dvorak that he now sucks at QWERTY
Jan 24 20:10:00 <PWill> meatballhat: I tried it for like a day and gave u[
Jan 24 20:10:04 <PWill> up
Jan 24 20:10:06 * jgedeon thinks meatballhat is trying to go gray.
Jan 24 20:10:25 <meatballhat> jgedeon: indeed I am :-D
Jan 24 20:10:43 <meatballhat> already beginning to turn ....
Jan 24 20:10:54 <meatballhat> gray, that is :-)
Jan 24 20:12:43 <theidiotthatisme> lol
Jan 24 20:13:05 <meatballhat> Yo all: as a tie-in with the F2F... and related to theidiotthatisme's lightscribe fun ... here's this: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/OhioTeam/CDdistribution
Jan 24 20:14:36 <theidiotthatisme> Looks good
Jan 24 20:15:02 <theidiotthatisme> I'll use my slim-jewel cases for Firefox/Thunderbird, Gimp, and Openoffice.org then
Jan 24 20:15:33 <theidiotthatisme> We should definitely try and get started on designing the brochure and figuring out what information to put in along with where to get other info
Jan 24 20:15:44 <meatballhat> theidiotthatisme: I plan to have a full "prototype" ready by Saturday .... :-)
Jan 24 20:16:28 <theidiotthatisme> meatballhat: Can't wait to see it. Email me (theidiotthatisme@gmail.com) so I know to look ;)
Jan 24 20:16:58 <meatballhat> as for the content ... lets get something started on the wiki, eh?

Jan 24 20:17:21 <theidiotthatisme> Yay!
Jan 24 20:18:00 <theidiotthatisme> Now I just gotta figure out enough places for my slim jewel cases lol
Jan 24 20:19:31 <meatballhat> hehe .... we should fill 'em with Edgy iso's and leave them at the mall :-P
Jan 24 20:20:17 <meatballhat> label them "not porn" :-D
Jan 24 20:20:18 <jgedeon> Yea then the little kids would think they stole something and be so proud of themselves.
Jan 24 20:20:58 <theidiotthatisme> oh boy >.<
Jan 24 20:21:12 <meatballhat> we need to tap into the deviant demographic :-D
Jan 24 20:21:30 <jgedeon> Once they booted it up they would think it was worth alot more than windbloz

Jan 24 20:24:30 <Vorian> hello jgedeon :)
Jan 24 20:24:54 <meatballhat> shall we talk about CD distro and publicity?
Jan 24 20:25:14 * Vorian points to the topic
Jan 24 20:25:35 <Vorian> Where are your CD's placed? Libraries, College Book Stores, Local Computer Stores.... the possibilities are endless!
Jan 24 20:25:38 <theidiotthatisme> meatballhat: CD team and Education team wiki pages have been updated
Jan 24 20:25:54 <Vorian> theidiotthatisme, they look great!
Jan 24 20:26:03 <meatballhat> theidiotthatisme: awesome! :-)
Jan 24 20:26:05 * Vorian was looking the other day
Jan 24 20:26:40 <theidiotthatisme> Thanks you guys
Jan 24 20:27:02 <goatdad13> can't stay long emailed ROUGH draft of 1st release to meatballhat
Jan 24 20:27:15 <goatdad13> waiting on his feedback to edit

Jan 24 20:27:50 <goatdad13> okay
Jan 24 20:28:23 <meatballhat> yes I did ... sorry ... worky busy lately and had a late night last night ... bad excuses :-(
Jan 24 20:28:31 <goatdad13> understand
Jan 24 20:28:43 <meatballhat> I found a press release about 6.06 on the Ubuntu main site
Jan 24 20:28:48 <meatballhat> and I liked the voice ...
Jan 24 20:28:57 <meatballhat> and the audience they were shooting for
Jan 24 20:29:04 <goatdad13> have to look for that
Jan 24 20:29:05 * meatballhat looks for it ... :-P
Jan 24 20:29:32 <goatdad13> went back and tried to pull older releases for Ubuntu to get some ideas
Jan 24 20:30:29 <theidiotthatisme> Sounds good
Jan 24 20:31:00 <meatballhat> <aside> on a slightly unrelated note, the current diy marketing site is shaping up okay ...
Jan 24 20:31:19 <meatballhat> http://diy.devubuntu.com
Jan 24 20:31:31 <goatdad13> been there before, but wasn't much on
Jan 24 20:31:36 <goatdad13> will have to go back
Jan 24 20:32:08 <meatballhat> content is still (intentionally) lacking
Jan 24 20:32:30 <theidiotthatisme> intentionally?
Jan 24 20:32:34 <meatballhat> work on db still ... :-P
Jan 24 20:33:10 <Vorian> meatballhat, I like this page https://wiki.ubuntu.com/OhioTeam/CDdistribution
Jan 24 20:33:51 <meatballhat> Vorian: thanks .... theidiotthatisme and I really should talk more :-D
Jan 24 20:34:39 <Vorian> Did you know if you do {*} on the wiki, you get a CoF bullet point?
Jan 24 20:34:54 <theidiotthatisme> meatballhat: Gosh, am I in trouble again? lol
Jan 24 20:34:59 <meatballhat> hoh??? how cool is that?
Jan 24 20:35:08 <meatballhat> theidiotthatisme: no no no :-D
Jan 24 20:35:44 <meatballhat> I just want to know more about all things CD distro
Jan 24 20:36:04 <meatballhat> and lightscribe ... :-D
Jan 24 20:36:46 * rrittenhouse (n=tad@cpe-76-188-35-66.neo.res.rr.com) has joined #ubuntu-ohio
Jan 24 20:36:47 <theidiotthatisme> Lightscribe is fun :-D

Jan 24 20:39:59 <Vorian> SO......
Jan 24 20:40:11 <Vorian> CD Distribution!
Jan 24 20:40:26 <Vorian> Has anyone placed CD's?
Jan 24 20:40:57 <theidiotthatisme> Haven't been able to get to the library while it's open yet O:-)
Jan 24 20:41:26 <Vorian> dang!
Jan 24 20:41:34 <theidiotthatisme> Are we waiting til we get the brochure designed with the DVD cases or should we start with our regular CD's first?
Jan 24 20:42:03 * meatballhat is waiting to give libraries the schweet DVD case versions :-) ... coming this weekend
Jan 24 20:42:17 * Vorian might be able to get you some 6.10 cd's if anyone is interested :)
Jan 24 20:42:23 <jgedeon> Haven't placed any CD but in the last week we have three more *ubuntu users in this area. And none of them are dual booting.
Jan 24 20:42:40 <meatballhat> oh yeah!!! Vorian has 6.10 CD's!!!
Jan 24 20:42:42 <theidiotthatisme> Either way I'm just short of purchasing cases or CD's for distribution, but hopefully will get more money soon
Jan 24 20:42:44 * Vorian might be able to get you some 6.10 cd's if anyone is interested :)
Jan 24 20:42:46 * Vorian might be able to get you some 6.10 cd's if anyone is interested :)

Jan 24 20:42:49 * Vorian might be able to get you some 6.10 cd's if anyone is interested :)
Jan 24 20:42:50 <theidiotthatisme> lol
Jan 24 20:42:51 * Vorian might be able to get you some 6.10 cd's if anyone is interested :)
Jan 24 20:42:58 <theidiotthatisme> Should we focus on distributing the newest or LTS?
Jan 24 20:43:10 <meatballhat> both?
Jan 24 20:43:13 <Vorian> send me your addresses, I'll hook you up
Jan 24 20:43:15 <meatballhat> :-D
Jan 24 20:43:20 <Vorian> stalcups@gmail.com
Jan 24 20:43:52 <Vorian> The loco contact from the Utah team sent me about 70 CD's
Jan 24 20:44:07 * Vorian watches his inbox fill up
Jan 24 20:44:13 <meatballhat> http://www.google.com/maps?q=221+Ivanhoe+Rd,+Bedford,+OH+44146&sa=X&oi=m... <-- that's me :-)
Jan 24 20:44:49 <jgedeon> Man those yards are small.
Jan 24 20:44:51 <Vorian> meatballhat, check
Jan 24 20:45:08 <rrittenhouse> i have 5.10 cds
Jan 24 20:45:17 <meatballhat> jgedeon: you're tellin *me* ;-)
Jan 24 20:45:18 <rrittenhouse> someone ordered a bunch of them and gave me a bag
Jan 24 20:45:59 <Vorian> theidiotthatisme, check
Jan 24 20:46:03 <Vorian> jgedeon, check
Jan 24 20:46:28 <Vorian> rrittenhouse, do you want 6.10 cd's to give out?
Jan 24 20:46:31 <theidiotthatisme> :-D
Jan 24 20:46:52 <rrittenhouse> I *could* put some at the library if they would let me
Jan 24 20:47:03 <Vorian> rrittenhouse, they will, I promise.
Jan 24 20:47:12 <rrittenhouse> but this town is population 900 or so
Jan 24 20:47:20 <Vorian> :)
Jan 24 20:47:32 <Vorian> and it has a library?
Jan 24 20:47:41 <rrittenhouse> yeah
Jan 24 20:47:45 <Vorian> lol
Jan 24 20:47:49 <rrittenhouse> or a hole in the wall
Jan 24 20:47:58 <Vorian> ha!
Jan 24 20:48:08 <meatballhat> Vorian: btw, I'll be posting a similar offer once the DVD's are ready (next week.... fingers crossed)
Jan 24 20:48:10 * jgedeon keeps comment to himself.
Jan 24 20:48:16 <rrittenhouse> no lets hear it
Jan 24 20:48:21 <Vorian> meatballhat, :)
Jan 24 20:48:24 <rrittenhouse> i hate this POS town... Tuscarawas, Ohio
Jan 24 20:49:03 <Vorian> jgedeon, whats up?
Jan 24 20:49:04 <jgedeon> IMO a POS town is just what you make of it. If you don't like it you get involved and make a difference.
Jan 24 20:49:59 <jgedeon> Nothing. A little thought came through my mind about rrittenhouse's comment about the hole in the wall...... Didn't want to see the !lang post. So I kept quiet.
Jan 24 20:50:13 <rrittenhouse> hahah wrong hole in the wall
Jan 24 20:50:19 <jgedeon> ROTFLMAO
Jan 24 20:50:28 <Vorian> ah, that does not work here....
Jan 24 20:50:29 <jgedeon> !thought
Jan 24 20:51:04 <rrittenhouse> True but im saying they are aholes in this town... it seems like everybody in it is. I have to wait a week to get my mail sometimes because of the shifts i work
Jan 24 20:51:18 <rrittenhouse> because they dont keep the place unlocked like bigger cities do (no mail delivery)
Jan 24 20:51:37 <Vorian> ok, rants over right?
Jan 24 20:52:08 <Vorian> good
Jan 24 20:52:35 <Vorian> So, CD distribution will be a key to us getting approved!
Jan 24 20:52:44 <rrittenhouse> i gotta go eat brb
Jan 24 20:52:48 <rrittenhouse> =/
Jan 24 20:53:30 <Vorian> attn all!
Jan 24 20:53:30 <meatballhat> Vorian: right on!
Jan 24 20:53:40 <Vorian> when we get approved
Jan 24 20:53:45 <Vorian> this is what we get
Jan 24 20:53:46 <Vorian> http://ubuntu-utah.org/index.php/2006/11/02/ubuntu-kubuntu-edubuntu-cds-...
Jan 24 20:54:14 <jgedeon> FWIW Monday evening at 1830 there is a technology commitee meeting at Southeast Schools and Open Source and Edubuntu WILL be brought up during that meeting.
Jan 24 20:54:16 * Vorian points to the boxes (100 cd's in each box)
Jan 24 20:54:34 <Vorian> jgedeon, by you?
Jan 24 20:54:57 <jgedeon> I have been asked, more like told or threatened, to be there.
Jan 24 20:55:14 <Vorian> jgedeon, nice!
Jan 24 20:55:14 <theidiotthatisme> that's a lot of CD's
Jan 24 20:55:28 <Vorian> theidiotthatisme, right!
Jan 24 20:55:58 <meatballhat> jgedeon: "Southeast" schools .... where? :-D
Jan 24 20:56:31 <jgedeon> meatballhat: In southeast portage county.
Jan 24 20:56:42 <meatballhat> gotcha :-)
Jan 24 20:57:05 <jgedeon> meatballhat: http://se-web.portage.k12.oh.us/
Jan 24 20:57:33 <jgedeon> meatballhat: about 30 minutes southeast of you. A nice easy drive.
Jan 24 20:58:18 <Vorian> jgedeon, what kind o' support do you need?
Jan 24 20:58:47 <meatballhat> jgedeon: yes yes ... need any help?
Jan 24 20:59:50 <jgedeon> Vorian not really sure yet. This is going to more of a rant meeting I think. There are plenty of parent pissed that there are a lack of technology in the school... And I am going to go and show them a better and more affordable light.. Not sure how deep things are going to get but have been working on a few hand outs and a slideshow.
Jan 24 21:00:20 <Vorian> Here's an idea
Jan 24 21:00:25 <Vorian> never mind
Jan 24 21:00:37 <jgedeon> I'm tired of trying to make a difference and trying to get a hold of the IT admin so that I can help and never hearing back from him. I think he thinks I want his job.
Jan 24 21:00:43 <jgedeon> LEt hear it vorian
Jan 24 21:00:56 <Vorian> there are some great power points on edubuntu
Jan 24 21:01:01 <meatballhat> jgedeon: I gotta run right now, but you should gimme a ring over the weekend
Jan 24 21:01:18 <meatballhat> my digits are on LP
Jan 24 21:01:20 <jgedeon> meatballhat: if I can find the time this weekend I will try.
Jan 24 21:01:50 <jgedeon> Weekends just got bad for me the the next month.
Jan 24 21:01:51 <meatballhat> peace out, y'all :-D
Jan 24 21:01:55 <jgedeon> L8rs
Jan 24 21:01:57 <Vorian> see ya meatballhat
Jan 24 21:02:02 * meatballhat (n=dbuch@unaffiliated/meatballhat) has left #ubuntu-ohio ("puppies or small dogs?")
Jan 24 21:02:06 <jgedeon> Vorian whats tis idea?
Jan 24 21:02:07 <goatdad13> I too must disappear good night all
Jan 24 21:02:13 * goatdad13 has quit ("Leaving")
Jan 24 21:02:20 <Vorian> nufink really
Jan 24 21:02:20 * Black5un|away has quit ("I bent G`norts ex-wife over")
Jan 24 21:02:28 <Vorian> lol
Jan 24 21:02:42 * Black5un has quit ("e credible;these guys are unbleievable")
Jan 24 21:03:10 * Black5un (i=mr@cpe-71-79-229-244.woh.res.rr.com) has joined #ubuntu-ohio
Jan 24 21:03:54 <jgedeon> Anyone in here that is actually still in school?
Jan 24 21:04:58 <Vorian> nope
Jan 24 21:05:01 <theidiotthatisme> what level of school?
Jan 24 21:05:10 <jgedeon> K-12
Jan 24 21:05:23 <theidiotthatisme> sorry, just passed on
Jan 24 21:05:43 <jgedeon> That is my focus right now. Do have a teacher from Kent State coming to talk to me.
Jan 24 21:06:28 <theidiotthatisme> awesome!
Jan 24 21:07:03 <jgedeon> Vorian what subject are we supposed to be on now?
Jan 24 21:07:20 <Vorian> I think our time is up
Jan 24 21:07:33 <theidiotthatisme> ?
Jan 24 21:07:51 <Vorian> I missed the first 20, what was the agenda
Jan 24 21:07:59 <jgedeon> Oh ok. Wasn't going to ask how the F2F project was coming along. and when we can start publizing(sp) it.
Jan 24 21:08:11 <jgedeon> No one stated on.
Jan 24 21:08:22 <jgedeon> I think tonight we just talked about CD's
Jan 24 21:09:12 <theidiotthatisme> Yep pretty much just the CD's
Jan 24 21:09:28 <jgedeon> IMO in the CD covers that are being done there should be something about the F2F for help.
Jan 24 21:09:51 <jgedeon> And maybe cards printed up that can be placed with the CD's for help.
Jan 24 21:11:27 <theidiotthatisme> jgedeon: that's a good idea
Jan 24 21:11:34 <Vorian> agreed
Jan 24 21:11:39 * jgedeon checks if he needs a breath mint.
Jan 24 21:11:53 <theidiotthatisme> Although maybe a URL to the support request form might be good too? In the brochure?
Jan 24 21:11:56 <Vorian> Jacob has been working on the flow of F2F
Jan 24 21:12:01 <jgedeon> I just think it would build on the selling point.
Jan 24 21:13:13 <Vorian> https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-us-oh/attachments/20070118/5b28...
Jan 24 21:13:37 <jgedeon> ???
Jan 24 21:13:52 <jgedeon> Not sure if I am seeing what I am supposed to be seeing.
Jan 24 21:14:10 <Vorian> sorry
Jan 24 21:14:11 <Vorian> https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-us-oh/attachments/20070118/5b28...
Jan 24 21:14:33 <Vorian> its a rough draft Jacob has been working on
Jan 24 21:14:54 <theidiotthatisme> Looking good
Jan 24 21:14:54 <jgedeon> Vorian, I'm not complaining about his drafting abilities but he should look into dia.
Jan 24 21:15:09 <theidiotthatisme> I need to get more stuff moving, I've been slacking.
Jan 24 21:15:15 <theidiotthatisme> dia?
Jan 24 21:15:54 <jgedeon> http://www.gnome.org/projects/dia/
Jan 24 21:16:09 <jgedeon> Like viseo
Jan 24 21:16:17 <theidiotthatisme> ah ok I know Visio lol
Jan 24 21:16:38 <jgedeon> Are they still writing the module for it?
Jan 24 21:16:44 <Vorian> visio, whats that?
Jan 24 21:16:46 <Vorian> LOL

Jan 24 21:33:39 <rrittenhouse> well i guess its all able to be customized but its just the task of customizing something that you didnt write.... heh
Jan 24 21:33:51 <jgedeon> rrittenhouse: your not the only one.
