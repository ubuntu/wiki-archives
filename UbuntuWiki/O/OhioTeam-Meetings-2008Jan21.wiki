(08:12:48 PM) markyb86: I work till 7
(08:12:51 PM) tnseditor: ooo
(08:13:13 PM) jacob: http://ohio.ubuntu-us.org/ = failboat
(08:13:17 PM) ***jacob = captain
(08:13:26 PM) tnseditor: ?
(08:13:53 PM) jacob: the site is empty, mostly due to my lack of updates on it
(08:14:00 PM) tnseditor: oh
(08:14:17 PM) jacob: the fact that i'm switching servers doesn't help :P
(08:14:20 PM) tnseditor: :-p
(08:15:14 PM) jacob: i've got to get dns for the domain running on linode, and then fire off an email or two to get the details bumped
(08:15:18 PM) tnseditor: so, anyone have any ideas for the website?... like any text, graphics, layout, etc?
(08:15:45 PM) soldierboy: nada
(08:15:59 PM) markyb86: we need some screen shots of gutsy gnome and kde
(08:16:03 PM) jacob: for reference: http://chi.ubuntu-us.org/
(08:16:15 PM) jacob: actually that's ironic
(08:16:21 PM) markyb86: and maybe we can work on a writeup of all it's pluses
(08:16:28 PM) jacob: chicago's site used to be more up-to-date
(08:16:32 PM) tnseditor: oh :-p
(08:16:34 PM) jacob: now we're winning :P
(08:16:37 PM) tnseditor: haha
(08:17:17 PM) tnseditor: I think that we could mention the subteams on there and their purpose and then have a link there
(08:17:22 PM) jacob: markyb86: yes screenies will be good
(08:17:22 PM) tnseditor: like
(08:18:16 PM) jacob: tnseditor: thing is, the target audience of loco sites are random people, usually not affiliated with any loco or ubuntu even
(08:18:28 PM) jacob: they might be the first thing they see with ubuntu
(08:18:32 PM) tnseditor: Education Team-  The education team does blah blah blah blah.  If you are interested in participating click here (link) and also have a link to what they do
(08:18:38 PM) tnseditor: true
(08:19:32 PM) jacob: so while those would be fine to have on the site, the average joe wouldn't really care how we do things
(08:19:35 PM) tnseditor: can you create another page with the teams (that's a static site and not a wiki)?
(08:19:40 PM) jacob: they just want to get ubuntu or support
(08:20:02 PM) markyb86: We'll need to tell them why they want ubuntu
(08:20:07 PM) tnseditor: right
(08:20:08 PM) jacob: exactly
(08:20:22 PM) markyb86: and also show them why
(08:20:22 PM) tnseditor: that could be the first thing, but also have other links on the site
(08:20:28 PM) markyb86: yeah
(08:20:33 PM) soldierboy: i disagree that the target audience is going to be new users..
(08:20:38 PM) jacob: tnseditor: i can, but i'd rather get the site moved over first to the new server
(08:20:44 PM) tnseditor: that's fine
(08:20:53 PM) jacob: then i'll hook everyone up with keys and admin access on drupal and whatnot
(08:20:58 PM) posingaspopular: theidiotthatisme: triloco tomorrow ;p
(08:21:09 PM) posingaspopular: bbl
(08:21:13 PM) tnseditor: ok
(08:21:23 PM) soldierboy: new users are going to go to ubuntu.com, i think anyone going to our loco site, is going to be interested in finding out what ubuntu ohio loco team is doing
(08:21:39 PM) jacob: true, but not always
(08:21:51 PM) soldierboy: there's always exceptions, yet
(08:21:57 PM) soldierboy: *yes
(08:22:02 PM) jacob: a lot of the time we get visitors are for those wanting more "local" support so they can relate better
(08:22:06 PM) tnseditor: on the "make a support request" page a link should be given to UF
(08:22:22 PM) jacob: hehe, that's another thing
(08:22:24 PM) tnseditor: or at least our section on UF
(08:22:25 PM) tnseditor: ?
(08:22:41 PM) jacob: it goes to the F2F/locosupport module if i remember right, which is old and outdated
(08:22:49 PM) jacob: sounds weird to criticize my own project, but hey
(08:22:59 PM) tnseditor: :-p
(08:23:02 PM) jacob: maybe i should release a new locosupport, meh
(08:23:48 PM) tnseditor: another thing to have a link to on our website is our past events and event information
(08:24:05 PM) tnseditor: that way new people can understand what we have done
(08:24:27 PM) jacob: yeah
(08:24:42 PM) markyb86: and maybe a roadmap where we want to be in said time period
(08:24:54 PM) tnseditor: like upcoming things
(08:25:03 PM) tnseditor: such as Ubucon and Ohio Linux Fest 2008
(08:25:04 PM) soldierboy: jacob: do you track search-data on the site?
(08:25:06 PM) markyb86: heck yeah and set some goals on it
(08:25:28 PM) jacob: soldierboy: let me check
(08:25:38 PM) theidiotthatisme: :-)
(08:26:07 PM) jacob: "No log messages available." < search terms
(08:26:20 PM) soldierboy: hm..
(08:26:35 PM) jacob: i can check referrer stats
(08:26:45 PM) jacob: ah crud
(08:26:49 PM) jacob: didn't have logging on period
(08:26:51 PM) jacob: :-!
(08:26:58 PM) soldierboy: well i think it would be useful to design the site around that data...
(08:27:00 PM) jacob: that will be another thing to change i guess :D
(08:27:02 PM) soldierboy: well, thats out
(08:28:04 PM) tnseditor: another link to add on the support center page is the screencast links
(08:28:16 PM) tnseditor: like for installing and adding/removing programs
(08:28:20 PM) jacob: anyway, i'm prepping mysql to transfer right now, i should have the site pointed at the new server in an hour or so, at which point we can mess around with
(08:28:33 PM) tnseditor: ok :-)
(08:29:03 PM) theidiotthatisme: Sounds good
(08:29:36 PM) tnseditor: brb...
(08:29:44 PM) tnseditor: I need to chat with Nature
(08:29:47 PM) jacob: lol
(08:30:23 PM) soldierboy: * nature :No such nick/channel
(08:30:34 PM) soldierboy: :P
(08:30:40 PM) theidiotthatisme is now known as nature
(08:30:44 PM) nature: :-P
(08:30:57 PM) nature is now known as Nature
(08:31:02 PM) Nature: :-D
(08:31:06 PM) jacob: lol
(08:31:14 PM) Nature: Oh, sorry
(08:31:22 PM) Nature: oops
(08:31:25 PM) Nature: too many nick changes
(08:31:27 PM) soldierboy: lol
(08:31:30 PM) Nature is now known as theidiotthatisme
(08:31:33 PM) theidiotthatisme: yay
(08:32:24 PM) theidiotthatisme left the room (quit: "http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client").
(08:34:46 PM) soldierboy: does the site have to follow the ubuntu template?
(08:35:07 PM) jacob: not necessarily, but it essentially is the "standard" for loco teams
(08:35:38 PM) soldierboy: bah, we need to set the standard :-D
(08:36:06 PM) markyb86: hes right
(08:36:20 PM) jacob: there is probably an updated theme engine from canonical, but i'd have to dig a wile to find it :P
(08:36:38 PM) tnseditor: back
(08:37:12 PM) jacob: anyway tnseditor would get the say on the theme being mr. communication and all ;)
(08:37:22 PM) tnseditor: yay!
(08:37:24 PM) tnseditor: :-p
(08:38:20 PM) soldierboy: being a new member of the team and all, I bring an "outsider" perspective to the team (for the time being) and i gotta say, the website doesn't do much for me
(08:38:42 PM) tnseditor: it doesn't have a lot of action
(08:38:45 PM) jacob: aye, it needs some updatin
(08:39:15 PM) soldierboy: what separates it from any other? (other than "ohio" under the logo and links pointing to our forums, etc)
(08:39:41 PM) jacob: yeah, true
(08:39:54 PM) jacob: we need some ohio-ish picture for the banner
(08:40:05 PM) soldierboy: what was that link you gave me tnseditor? the one with the pictures to the linuxfest, i believe those should be front page
(08:40:11 PM) soldierboy: or one rather
(08:40:17 PM) soldierboy: just showing folks that we do something
(08:40:21 PM) tnseditor: Phoenix301: could you do a collage (sp?) think?
(08:40:25 PM) tnseditor: *thing
(08:41:43 PM) soldierboy: it'll encourage people to get involved, heck it would work for me, i'd think "wow, how cool, the team has a booth at linuxfest representing ubuntu"
(08:44:03 PM) soldierboy: um....the defense rests
(08:44:16 PM) markyb86: some kids with big glasses will be like "dang, flippin sweet"
(08:44:26 PM) jacob: sorry, workin on the transfer :P
(08:44:36 PM) markyb86: where can i get a plethora of cds to dish out at work?
(08:44:44 PM) tnseditor: I have my glasses made so they will be thinner than what they should be
(08:44:47 PM) tnseditor: :-p
(08:44:49 PM) markyb86: there are about 2000 employees where i work
(08:44:51 PM) markyb86: ha
(08:44:54 PM) tnseditor: holy cow
(08:44:54 PM) jacob: quite a bit
(08:44:54 PM) soldierboy: lol
(08:44:59 PM) tnseditor: um...
(08:45:04 PM) jacob: markyb86: you can try contacting shipit thru the custom form
(08:45:11 PM) tnseditor: you can get some from http://shipit.ubuntu.com
(08:45:14 PM) markyb86: I know I got 10 lol
(08:45:17 PM) jacob: request a somewhat smaller number though
(08:45:21 PM) jacob: like 500-ish
(08:45:42 PM) soldierboy: i need to connect with geeks at my work too, probably 2000+ as well
(08:46:25 PM) tnseditor: they don't necessarily need to be "geeks" though
(08:46:27 PM) jacob: sign in to shipit, and then visit https://shipit.ubuntu.com/specialrequest
(08:46:34 PM) soldierboy: true
(08:46:50 PM) markyb86: ill have to do a writeup and see if I can get like 100 or something
(08:46:52 PM) soldierboy: i haven't had much success at converting computer noobs though
(08:47:00 PM) soldierboy: usually windows powerusers who are bored
(08:47:20 PM) tnseditor: also maybe you could show them Elisa....
(08:47:29 PM) markyb86: everyone at national city can barely distinguish what a monitor is let alone how to "reboot"
(08:47:32 PM) tnseditor: http://elisa.fluendo.com/
(08:47:38 PM) tnseditor: haha
(08:47:52 PM) soldierboy: yeah, then try to explain linux....
(08:47:58 PM) soldierboy: gah!
(08:48:05 PM) markyb86: They cant even learn windows
(08:48:06 PM) markyb86: haha
(08:48:12 PM) markyb86: thats why I have a job
(08:48:25 PM) jacob: :P
(08:48:25 PM) soldierboy: is it like a brown windows??? idontgetit!
(08:48:35 PM) tnseditor: I think there is actually less to learn with Windows (especially if you don't know Windows)
(08:48:53 PM) tnseditor: you don't have to know/worry about viruses, spyware, etc.
(08:48:56 PM) soldierboy: sure, but i have a hard time just getting past explaining what linux is
(08:49:11 PM) jacob: tnseditor: you mean less to learn _than_ with windows?
(08:49:18 PM) markyb86: could install xfce and just use the redmond theme they might not notice
(08:49:27 PM) tnseditor: I think there is less you really have to learn with Linux than Windows
(08:49:29 PM) tnseditor: I mean... 
(08:49:30 PM) soldierboy: lol, true
(08:49:52 PM) tnseditor: you could learn commands and stuff, but Synaptic makes things easy for installing and uninstalling
(08:50:09 PM) jacob: Add/Remove is even easier, it has perty pictures :P
(08:50:10 PM) tnseditor: and you don't have to keep every app up to date individually
(08:50:13 PM) tnseditor: :-p
(08:50:14 PM) markyb86: even the add/remove
(08:50:16 PM) soldierboy: yeah, i think for computer noobs, if you mimick the windows gui as much as you can, that takes away a lot of the shock
(08:50:20 PM) markyb86: ahh jacob beat me
(08:50:21 PM) tnseditor: right
(08:50:24 PM) jacob: hehe
(08:50:26 PM) tnseditor: :-p
(08:51:03 PM) jacob: just imported the databases... setting up an A record to update the site
(08:51:07 PM) soldierboy: have to rename 'text editor' to 'notepad' as well
(08:51:18 PM) tnseditor: but with Windows you have to keep Adobe Reader, Flash player, Windows, MS Office, etc. all up to date individually
(08:51:26 PM) markyb86: and give firefox the internet explorer icon
(08:51:28 PM) tnseditor: :-p
(08:51:32 PM) soldierboy: lol
(08:51:36 PM) tnseditor: "Click on the internet" :-p
(08:51:38 PM) markyb86: "WHERES MY E ICON"
(08:51:53 PM) soldierboy: "Click to get started.."
(08:52:07 PM) tnseditor: "No, you click to open a web browser"
(08:52:07 PM) jacob: soldierboy: that tooltip is burned in my mind
(08:52:13 PM) tnseditor: *blank stares
(08:52:20 PM) soldierboy: and the obligatory aol icon on the desktop as well
(08:52:33 PM) jacob: "6 MONTHS FREE - AOL'
(08:52:34 PM) soldierboy: even if it does nothing
(08:52:38 PM) markyb86: or today I had "My mouse pointer was moving crazy like you tech guys were in there moving my mouse around, i think its because of this new icon i have 'show desktop' was someone in there moving my mouse?"
(08:52:47 PM) tnseditor: :-p
(08:52:51 PM) soldierboy: lol
(08:52:52 PM) jacob: heh
(08:52:55 PM) markyb86: hahaah
(08:53:07 PM) markyb86: I was like, did you say yes to remote assistance before that?
(08:53:14 PM) tnseditor: :-p
(08:53:24 PM) markyb86: "no" so I disabled the track-point and all was well
(08:53:43 PM) tnseditor: :-)
(08:54:14 PM) soldierboy: i used to be a network technician in the army, and the worst was seeing 800 'new folder' icons on the desktop, i knew i was in for a rough ride...
(08:54:22 PM) tnseditor: :-p
(08:54:26 PM) tnseditor: New Folder
(08:54:30 PM) tnseditor: New Folder 1
(08:54:34 PM) tnseditor: .....2
(08:54:35 PM) soldierboy: lol
(08:54:35 PM) tnseditor: ....3
(08:55:03 PM) markyb86: oh hell no!! hahahhhaah
(08:55:10 PM) Phoenix301: gehehe "from a company that tells you to shut your computer off by clicking start"
(08:55:13 PM) markyb86: I know exactly what you mean!!
(08:55:29 PM) tnseditor: ...
(08:55:36 PM) tnseditor: come Windows CEMeNT!
(08:55:42 PM) tnseditor: *comes
(08:55:42 PM) jacob: really, i mean would you click "Start" or "System" to shutdown?
(08:56:05 PM) soldierboy: jacob: never really thought of that before, how right you are
(08:56:20 PM) jacob: soldierboy: Phoenix301 pointed it out
(08:56:43 PM) markyb86: well actually some of the bank branches where i work have nothing on the start menu except bank apps and then they have a reboot icon on the desktop
(08:56:45 PM) soldierboy: errr, phoenix i meant, how right you are
(08:56:54 PM) Phoenix301: its from a funny video i saw making fun of windows
(08:56:59 PM) jacob: lol
(08:57:11 PM) Phoenix301: lol
(08:57:34 PM) Phoenix301: doh well...so what is this about revamping the website?
(08:57:55 PM) soldierboy: oh ya, back to official "bid-ness"
(08:57:56 PM) tnseditor: "Combining the best from Windows CE, Windows Me, and Windows NT we've made Windows CEMeNT!"
(08:58:31 PM) markyb86: where di you see that? Ill have to look at it
(08:58:41 PM) tnseditor: let me find it
(08:59:13 PM) markyb86: Hah im using my hoopty with no HD right now so take your time
(09:00:47 PM) markyb86: Im pissed, i recompiled the DSL dvd with drivers for my wifi card and when i bootup, the module pcmf502rd doesnt exist in dsl.

(09:03:15 PM) markyb86 left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
(09:03:18 PM) tnseditor: sorry :-p
(09:03:27 PM) tnseditor: my internet isn't too fast
(09:03:32 PM) tnseditor: and I had to google it

(09:09:11 PM) tnseditor: (for Ubucon)
(09:09:34 PM) soldierboy: um...no but i can probably find out
(09:09:53 PM) tnseditor: jacob: do you know any contact info for Canonical?
(09:10:12 PM) jacob: tnseditor: it's difficult to say the least :D
(09:10:27 PM) jacob: http://canonical.com/aboutus/contactus is the best page i've found
(09:10:33 PM) tnseditor: oh
(09:10:49 PM) tnseditor: do you want to contact them?
(09:10:49 PM) soldierboy: yeah, was just looking at that
(09:11:09 PM) jacob: bout what?
(09:11:19 PM) tnseditor: Ubucon sponsorship
(09:11:48 PM) jacob: ah right, you'd have to ask theidiotthatisme for updates on that, i believe he contacted them
(09:11:53 PM) tnseditor: oh
(09:12:03 PM) tnseditor: ok
(09:12:35 PM) jacob: afaik.. it's difficult to contact them to begin with and even harder to get a sponsorship :P
(09:12:43 PM) tnseditor: oh
(09:12:53 PM) tnseditor: didn't they sponsor stuff at OLF?
(09:13:06 PM) jacob: but it's worth a try, i'll have to ask anthony bout it
(09:13:10 PM) tnseditor: ok
(09:13:12 PM) jacob: i think they sent a bunch of CDs
(09:13:26 PM) tnseditor: ok
(09:13:30 PM) tnseditor: that would be ince
(09:13:31 PM) tnseditor: *nice
