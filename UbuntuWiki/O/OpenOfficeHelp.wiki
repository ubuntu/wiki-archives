=== Summary ===

Replace the old jaxp1.1 and xmlsearch jars with newer ones, rewrite/patch the helpcontent2 build to build with the newer versions, which are distributed with a free license.

=== Rationale ===

The current approach providing the help packages built from pregenerated help data adds about 11MB per language to the ftp-archive. This space can be saved when the help packages can be built from the openoffice.org-l10n source.

=== Implementation ===

The java source used to build the helpcontent2 component use internal sun.* classes from jaxp1.1 (sun license), which cannot be found in jaxp1.2 or other free jaxp implementations. Patching the OOo2 sources to either build with libjaxp1.2-java or libgnujaxp-java involves replacing this use (in a few classes) with portable code.

This specification is implemented for dapper.
