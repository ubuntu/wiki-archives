I am working as an editor for several German language Linux magazines, doing some work for the English Linux Magazine, too.

I have a past as a Linux sysop.

There are some troubles with using Appletalk (netatalk). Solution is here: AppleTalk

I am interested in Free Software, Gnome, The Linux Desktop (as featured in the FreeDesktop project), "multimedia" (OpenGL, Video, Sound), Scribus, Mono.
