Ubuntu on Air! has different kind of guests, such as team managers, VPs, engineers, community contributors, etc. which will help us hold a Q&A session. We also have instructive sessions, which can be given by any community member at request, with the help of one of our staff members. Presentations or announcements can also be done via this source. You can check future events at <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntuonair.com/calendar|www.ubuntuonair.com/calendar]]</nowiki>
