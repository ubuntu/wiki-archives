20:04:57 <meatballhat> what's the fuss about?
20:05:07 <Vorian> hey meatballhat, I was just thanking you for last week
20:05:21 * goatdad13 (n=dave@ppp-69-223-142-91.dsl.wotnoh.ameritech.net) has joined #ubuntu-ohio
20:05:23 <meatballhat> ah! ... for extending the meeting an extra 2 hours :P ?
20:05:32 <Vorian> Is there any unfinished business from last week?
20:05:43 <theidiotthatisme> I dont think so?
20:06:02 <meatballhat> I see atoponce is joining us again :D
20:06:06 <Vorian> great!
20:07:32 <Vorian> I know meatballhat said we were holding off on our approval from the community council
20:07:38 <Vorian> last week
20:07:55 <Vorian> so
20:08:08 <hackle577> when is our next chance for approval BTW?
20:08:15 <Vorian> next month...
20:08:19 <Vorian> at some point
20:08:22 <hackle577> ok
20:08:57 <Vorian> In order to be ready to go in front of the council, we need some "activities" under our belts
20:09:11 <theidiotthatisme> That might be helpful :-)
20:09:13 <zerhacke> Any specific kind of activity?
20:10:00 * PriceChild (n=pricechi@ubuntu/member/pricechild) has joined #ubuntu-ohio
20:10:03 <Vorian> there are all types
20:10:07 <Vorian> hello PriceChild !
20:10:23 <PriceChild> erm... Hi Vorian
20:10:43 <Vorian> so
20:10:58 * PriceChild points out the http://ohio.ubuntu-us.com link in title is broken
20:11:27 <Vorian> A great idea meatballhat had was a press release
20:11:40 <rrittenhouse> http://ohio.ubuntu-us.org/
20:12:50 <Vorian> Any thoughts on a press release?
20:13:23 <meatballhat> it might help to add that the Press Release idea is directly related to the "Face to Face support" thingy
20:13:28 <goatdad13> Good idea, what would you wnat it to say
20:13:47 <meatballhat> that it's a fast and easy way to show our numbers/dedication/what-have-you
20:14:09 <meatballhat> goatdad13: there's a barely-begun draft up here: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/OhioTeam/PressRelease
20:14:18 <Vorian> who we are (ohio team) what ubuntu is | how we support the transition....
20:14:43 <SavatageBT> hello, can I ask a question?
20:14:43 <goatdad13> who are we targeting?
20:14:59 <goatdad13> what media outlets would we be targeting
20:15:13 <meatballhat> print & radio primarily
20:15:15 <goatdad13> what angle are we after
20:15:31 * Vorian has quit (Remote closed the connection)
20:15:31 <meatballhat> "free stuff that works" angle :D
20:15:43 <hackle577> obtuse
20:15:49 <theidiotthatisme> SavatageBT Of course
20:15:50 <meatballhat> SavatageBT: shoot!
20:16:44 <SavatageBT> I accidently found this channel, but hey I live in ohio and I use ubuntu...so how do I get involved?
20:17:02 <hackle577> oooooo!
20:17:18 <meatballhat> hackle577: get 'em! :D
20:17:24 <hackle577> lol ok
20:17:33 <hackle577> well Savatage...
20:18:24 <hackle577> I would start here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/OhioTeam
20:18:39 <hackle577> to familiarize yourself with the OhioTeam
20:18:45 * Vorian (n=steve@ubuntu/member/Vorian) has joined #ubuntu-ohio
20:18:50 <Vorian> arg!
20:18:56 * meatballhat admires hackle577's plug for the wiki ;-D
20:19:42 <hackle577> and if you feel you want to become a member after you've seen what we're all about, you can join our team here: https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-us-ohio/
20:20:14 <hackle577> and you're more than welcome to hang out for tonights meeting!
20:20:24 <SavatageBT> cool
20:20:43 <hackle577> if you have any specific questions, i'd reccommend asking Vorian aka Steve
20:20:48 <goatdad13> meatballhat: barely begun is an understatement
20:21:05 <hackle577> </plug for OhioTeam>
20:21:20 * Vorian is sorry for his rural internet disruptions...
20:21:22 <meatballhat> goatdad13: I was waiting for input from Canonical, as they offered to advise, but they're a bit too busy it seems ;)
20:21:45 <hackle577> Vorian: you missed this: SavatageBT: I accidently found this channel, but hey I live in ohio and I use ubuntu...so how do I get involved?
20:21:46 <Vorian> meatballhat, what do you think about just shooting one off?
20:22:00 <Vorian> pr that is....
20:22:31 <meatballhat> Vorian: I have no problem with sending something off to the press without pretending to represent the Ubuntu community *too* much :)
20:22:37 <theidiotthatisme> Vorian: Should we organize the F2F a little more before releasing the PR?
20:22:39 <meatballhat> I'd really love to have Canonical's blessing, that's all
20:22:41 <Vorian> welcome SavatageBT :)
20:22:46 <theidiotthatisme> Vorian: Or drafting it?
20:22:52 <goatdad13> mbh: did u write or is this from canonical's?
20:23:01 <Vorian> F2F is not that tricky to organize
20:23:04 * hackle577 is keeping score! PriceChild and technically Vorian entered the room after 8:10
20:23:12 <meatballhat> goatdad13: you mean that lonely paragraph? ... it's mine :P
20:23:34 <Vorian> organizing F2F support will be
20:23:35 <theidiotthatisme> Vorian: Okee dokee
20:23:36 <goatdad13> we can talk later
20:23:37 <Vorian> step 1
20:23:42 <Vorian> get volunteers
20:23:44 <zerhacke> F2F means?
20:23:49 <theidiotthatisme> Face 2 Face
20:23:56 <zerhacke> Oh. Call me stupid. lol
20:23:58 <Vorian> step 2
20:24:04 <PriceChild> hackle577, ?
20:24:16 <Vorian> list and publish volunteers
20:24:24 <Vorian> (email only)
20:24:30 <hackle577> PriceChild: a little wager that we who where early made
20:24:31 <Vorian> step 3
20:24:35 <hackle577> *were
20:24:40 <Vorian> mentor new users
20:25:11 <Vorian> all a new user need is one person they can count on for answers
20:25:22 <theidiotthatisme> As a shameful plug, if you haven't picked up the Ubuntu Book it's a good reference for helping others also.
20:25:34 <zerhacke> I'll volunteer. As a disabled American I am available almost all day every day.
20:25:36 <PriceChild> hackle577, a wager on me? how'd you know I was coming?
20:25:39 <Vorian> and that person doesn't need to have all the answers, but where to find them!
20:25:41 <meatballhat> theidiotthatisme: +1
20:26:06 <hackle577> PriceChild: a wager on how many people would show up in the room after 8:10 lol
20:26:07 * meatballhat also recommends "Ubuntu Hacks"
20:26:13 <Vorian> theidiotthatisme, yes :)
20:26:39 <hackle577> theidiotthatisme: what does the Ubu Book contain, specifically?
20:27:16 <Vorian> I think we can do two (2) press releases
20:27:25 <Vorian> one for Ubuntu in Ohio
20:27:26 <theidiotthatisme> hackle577: Background information on Ubuntu, installation and introduction to Ubuntu/Kubuntu, installing software, setting up printers, setting up servers, and desktop "recipes" (or hints) and some other stuff
20:27:38 <Vorian> One for Face 2 Face support
20:27:50 <Vorian> meatballhat, what say you?
20:27:52 <meatballhat> Vorian: +1
20:27:59 <Vorian> great!
20:28:02 <meatballhat> goatdad13: whaddya think?
20:28:02 <hackle577> theidiotthatisme: thanks
20:28:22 <Vorian> thoughts anyone on 2 press releases?
20:28:31 <Vorian> yea or nay?
20:28:38 <hackle577> one for F2F and the other... ?
20:28:38 <theidiotthatisme> hackle577: No problem. For those used to Ubuntu, it's a good reference. It's also good for hints in setting up stuff like Samba, and accessing Windows shares
20:28:47 <Vorian> hackle577, yes
20:28:55 <Vorian> the other is Ubuntu in Ohio
20:29:00 <hackle577> ahh ok
20:29:00 <theidiotthatisme> Vorian: What would the PR be exactly for Ubuntu in Ohio?
20:29:05 <Vorian> bug # 1 and all that
20:29:19 <Vorian> theidiotthatisme, ^^
20:29:21 <goatdad13> first one should be a general one about Ubuntu Ohio
20:29:28 <Vorian> goatdad13, right on!
20:29:35 <Vorian> and bug #1
20:29:40 <goatdad13> after it is set up F2F
20:30:02 <goatdad13> nothing like getting word out and not having a product
20:30:10 <goatdad13> kinda blows credibility
20:30:17 <hackle577> yeah just a tad
20:30:20 <meatballhat> goatdad13: +1
20:31:27 <theidiotthatisme> So definitely should organize it :-)
20:31:38 <meatballhat> Vorian: about setting up F2F ... it's under New Users Subteam, yes?
20:32:07 <theidiotthatisme> meatballhat: I believe so
20:32:27 <Vorian> yes
20:32:34 <Vorian> meatballhat, yes*
20:33:03 <meatballhat> is it fair to say that the New Users Subteam is the place to be for pretty much *all* OhioTeam members, then? :D ... if we all want to be part of F2F
20:33:31 * meatballhat is thinking that most of us probably already *are* doing F2F on some level
20:34:05 <Vorian> right meatballhat!
20:34:23 <meatballhat> could we simply declare that F2F is part of our core mission as a LoCo Team?
20:34:38 <meatballhat> ...and that all members are potential F2F support members?
20:34:40 <Vorian> meatballhat, yes I believe so...
20:34:51 <hackle577> eh, i dont know
20:34:59 <Vorian> hackle577, wha!
20:35:06 <hackle577> i'm still pretty much in the newb phase
20:35:08 <Vorian> jj
20:35:16 <hackle577> i wouldnt say all
20:35:17 <theidiotthatisme> hackle577: It's ok I am too
20:35:23 <goatdad13> me too
20:35:32 <theidiotthatisme> But I must say I think we should keep it under NU
20:35:45 <theidiotthatisme> F2F requires a bit more time than say, CD Distribution
20:35:55 <goatdad13> I'm still visiting the forums quite often for minor details
20:35:58 <Vorian> ok so F2F is New User
20:36:15 <hackle577> yeah, that seems most logical to me
20:36:36 <meatballhat> welllll .... what are the most common types of New User problems we've seen? anyone?
20:36:44 <Vorian> as for F2F, we need volunteers who are comfortable offering guidance...
20:37:01 <Vorian> after all, we can't force people to learn to use linux
20:37:09 <theidiotthatisme> Sign me up. If anyone needs assistance they can email me for support
20:37:12 <meatballhat> ...and most of the guidance I've had to offer New Users has to do with getting around Gnome :)
20:37:24 * Vorian is a gnome man
20:37:57 <meatballhat> most New Users I've converted are not former MS or OSX power users .. they just wanna get online and send email
20:37:57 <theidiotthatisme> I'm a fan of all the DE's
20:38:01 <goatdad13> gnome, whooo hoooo
20:38:19 * meatballhat is all about the gnome, too :D
20:38:25 <Vorian> hehe
20:38:45 <meatballhat> ...and the MS/OSX power users who *have* converted already know how to figure things out for themselves
20:39:06 <zerhacke> Pfft, E DR17 beats Gnome. :D
20:39:11 <Vorian> so 1.) PR about Ubuntu in Ohio / Ohio LoCo Team info
20:39:16 * hackle577 was an XP power user, if there is such a thing
20:39:24 <meatballhat> anything more complicated than basic internet/email/office usage is usually in the commercial realm anyway, which is what the Ubuntu Partners are for
20:39:25 <Vorian> 2.) Free as Beer support!
20:40:05 <hackle577> i like the press release idea
20:40:09 <hackle577> get the word out
20:40:09 <meatballhat> Vorian: +1 :D
20:40:25 * ChanServ gives channel operator status to Vorian
20:40:25 * Vorian has changed the topic to: Welcome To Ubuntu Ohio! || Now Organizing Teams - see http://ohio.ubuntu-us.org || Join in Party Planning for the release of Feisty Fawn April 20th and 21st || Meeting RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!
20:40:25 * ChanServ removes channel operator status from Vorian
20:40:30 <Vorian> great!
20:40:33 <Vorian> lets do it
20:40:37 <zerhacke> As soon as my internship starts I can provide an official, this is a real business venue in Eastern Ohio for Ubuntu. Is that press release worthy?
20:40:50 <Vorian> zerhacke, YAY!
20:41:00 <zerhacke> :D
20:41:05 <meatballhat> I'm just thinking that any individual team member who isn't comfortable being relied upon for F2F can simply pass the buck to another team member ... where's the harm?
20:41:21 <Vorian> meatballhat, no harm
20:41:22 * meatballhat thinks OhioTeam == F2F team
20:41:37 * meatballhat thinks New Users == second tier support
20:41:41 <zerhacke> As far as F2F goes, I'm comfortable offering help as needed. I've been with Linux since Yggdrasil so I know my way around.
20:41:44 <goatdad13> zerhacke: we might be able to fashion that into an introductory release
20:41:44 <Vorian> lets move that discussion to the mailing list
20:41:56 <Vorian> as for activity #3......
20:42:04 <zerhacke> Sweet, goatdad13, I'll be sure to report back just as soon as I get the official go ahead from my boss.
20:42:42 <goatdad13> meatballhat & I need to discuss what direction these will head but I think we can get a decent release going
20:42:59 <goatdad13> we will need a media list of outlets we want to target
20:43:07 <meatballhat> goatdad13: Marketing Team is on the case! :D
20:43:16 <Vorian> as for activity #3......
20:43:23 <Vorian> An easy one....
20:43:34 <Vorian> Find locations in your town
20:43:45 <Vorian> to drop off CD's
20:44:03 <Vorian> We make a list of where a person can pick up CD's
20:44:17 <Vorian> and a map
20:44:27 <Vorian> and
20:44:37 <Vorian> bamo! activity accomplished!
20:44:43 <Vorian> Any questions?
20:44:46 <theidiotthatisme> Vorian: Is there a place or person we should report to once we get approved for distributing locations?
20:44:51 <hackle577> I'm thinking Frappr, is that it?
20:44:53 <Vorian> me
20:44:59 <Vorian> theidiotthatisme, let me know
20:45:01 <zerhacke> I suggest the CDs should come from Shipit instead of burn your owns. Looks more professional.
20:45:17 <theidiotthatisme> zerhacke: that brings me to a point I have brought up before
20:45:20 <hackle577> zerhacke: agreed
20:45:26 <meatballhat> zerhacke: ideally, yes :) ... but we all know how long that takes :(
20:45:39 <zerhacke> meatballhat, yeah, 4+ weeks.
20:45:45 <meatballhat> theidiotthatisme: LightScribe? :D
20:45:51 <theidiotthatisme> I am getting my lightscribe this weekend. Would you guys like the regular artwork used or a custom artwork with "Distributed by your Ohio LoCo"
20:45:58 <Vorian> One thing I have done here in Chillicothe is have the libraries keep them to check out....
20:46:07 <meatballhat> +1 for official artwork
20:46:10 <Vorian> The libraries loved it!
20:46:13 <theidiotthatisme> meatballhat: You know me way too well.
20:46:35 <zerhacke> theidiotthatisme, collaborate with me on the artwork you use. I'm in process of setting up an unofficial Ubuntu-Ohio usplash and it would be an extra nice touch to have the artwork coincide.
20:46:37 <theidiotthatisme> Vorian: Tomorrow or Friday I will look into several locations, including one or two on campus for distribution
20:46:38 <meatballhat> Vorian: that's a great idea! ... did you "donate" them?
20:46:50 <Vorian> theidiotthatisme, great!
20:46:59 <Vorian> meatballhat, yes, they love donations
20:47:08 <zerhacke> Next on my list after the usplash is a gdm theme, a gnome splash, and a wallpaper.
20:47:10 <theidiotthatisme> zerhacke: Unfortunately I am not an artist, Marketing might be good at it though
20:47:27 <Vorian> Libraries love to get cutting edge computer stuff!
20:47:27 <zerhacke> I'm no artist either. I'm utilizing my wife's graphic ability.
20:47:29 <theidiotthatisme> Vorian: What was your approach with your library?
20:47:35 * meatballhat strongly urges distribution of official Ubuntu artwork when done as a LoCo Team ... what one does as self is one's own biz
20:47:49 <SavatageBT> want to throw this out as for me as a new linux user....what I found most frustrating was every one telling you about cryptic command line stuff to type in....migrating from windows to linux...new user need ways they can do things in the gui...Thats what I do for new linux users I show them how to use the gui and nautlis and such as root so they can get into it more...nothing drives people crazy like command line they dont understand...I spent al
20:47:49 <SavatageBT> low of time finding ways to do as much as possible in the gui
20:48:10 <Vorian> I went in and told them I would donate these CD's if they would be so kind as to have them available to check out to the public
20:48:11 <goatdad13> libraries, any type of small computer repair companies
20:48:11 <theidiotthatisme> SavatageBT: I understand your point
20:48:25 <meatballhat> SavatageBT: +1 for easing into CLI
20:48:35 <theidiotthatisme> SavatageBT: I personally set up people with ubuntu to include some options for them so they dont have to fiddle with commandline
20:49:42 <hackle577> F2F support volunteers can sign up now on the NU wiki page: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/OhioTeam/NewUserTeam
20:49:45 <goatdad13> will these CD's have any type of installation in?structions
20:49:56 <goatdad13> or at least someone to contact
20:50:16 <Vorian> hackle577, great idea! thanks :)
20:50:23 <meatballhat> goatdad13: that's where I think Marketing comes in once again ... getting some extra documentation ready that's written for "Ohioans"
20:50:36 <zerhacke> hackle577, joined!
20:50:44 <zerhacke> Well, pending approval of course.
20:50:47 <Vorian> meatballhat, what about southern ohioans?
20:50:49 <hackle577> zerhacke: word :-P
20:51:00 <theidiotthatisme> hackle577: Should we use display names or our real names? :-)
20:51:08 <hackle577> i am also now in southern ohio i guess, back at school
20:51:13 <meatballhat> goatdad13: I was sending an email off to my grandparents and decided to post it to the wiki instead: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/OhioTeam/UbuntuCDExplanation
20:51:27 <Vorian> zerhacke, done :)
20:51:30 <hackle577> theidiotthatisme: real probably
20:51:37 <zerhacke> Wow, you're on the ball Vorian.
20:51:38 <hackle577> up to you I gues
20:52:16 <Vorian> hackle577, I'm a southerner too :)
20:52:35 <hackle577> vorian: I'm in Butler county now, at college
20:52:49 <Vorian> ok so everyone psyched about giving CD's to libraries?
20:53:01 <Vorian> Another mailing list item!
20:53:13 <meatballhat> Vorian: +1 fo' sho' ... libraries are my jom
20:53:15 * etank has quit (Connection timed out)
20:53:21 <Vorian> bye etank
20:53:32 <Vorian> great!
20:53:46 <Vorian> I have three locations in Chillicothe already
20:54:04 <zerhacke> I can cover the new library and the old library in Cambridge, and maybe the Chamber of Commerce.
20:54:17 <zerhacke> I can work on covering more of East Ohio.
20:54:21 <meatballhat> anybody else here in Cuyahoga, Summit, Medina?
20:54:21 <hackle577> I can do libraries perhaps, not gaurantees regarding if they'll try it or not, since they are affliated with the university, which probably has policies about that sort of thing
20:55:22 <meatballhat> goatdad13: what do you think about the Marketing Team putting together some "liner notes?"
20:55:40 <goatdad13> sounds like we are going to have to do something
20:55:47 <theidiotthatisme> I'll attempt our on campus library and/or bookstore, our town library, and maybe find somewhere in the mall even
20:56:00 * meatballhat recommends Scribus over OOo for such stuff
20:56:04 <hackle577> I must say though, if I picked up a brand new LiveCD, i'd want some F2F love before I tried anything I wasn't familiar with
20:56:06 <goatdad13> what kind of packaging will the cd's be in when they are dropped off at the locations
20:56:47 <goatdad13> I would also suggest anytime of coffee shop where people can use laptops
20:56:47 <meatballhat> goatdad13: can we depend on libraries to stick 'em into those translucent plastic deals? :D
20:56:54 <theidiotthatisme> goatdad13: I'm guessing the official shipit packaging, or if burned with the official artwork, slim jewel cases
20:57:13 <zerhacke> Oh yeah, coffee shop is a good idea. We have one here in town.
20:57:21 <zerhacke> It's one of the wireless hotspots here.
20:57:30 <theidiotthatisme> zerhacke: That's a great idea.
20:57:38 <goatdad13> any place that is a wifi hotspot
20:57:47 <theidiotthatisme> Also if you have any local computer shops, maybe see if an employee there uses Linux and talk it up
20:57:54 <hackle577> goatdad13: good idea
20:57:56 <goatdad13> many McDonald's are now becoming open hotspots
20:58:01 <rrittenhouse> yeah
20:58:06 <zerhacke> theidiotthatisme, unfortunately I *am* the Linux geek in this town.
20:58:08 <zerhacke> lol
20:58:12 <goatdad13> must hit computer stores heavy
20:58:23 <rrittenhouse> i still like the idea of ubuntu live cds in places like best buy
20:58:26 <rrittenhouse> ;)
20:58:37 <rrittenhouse> hahah someone had that idea in here a while ago.
20:58:40 * meatballhat will be visiting every Bust Buy, Circuit City, etc. in Cuyahoga Co. :D
20:58:47 <rrittenhouse> hah
20:58:53 <rrittenhouse> there are no computer places here that i know of
20:58:57 <goatdad13> maybe the shop "techies" are already on bandwagon and would be looking to pitch in
20:59:07 * meatballhat is dead flippin' serious
20:59:08 <goatdad13> don't forget about the smaller ones as well
20:59:14 <rrittenhouse> theres a Pioneer Programming shop and i think two small computer repair shops
20:59:20 <meatballhat> "Ubuntu goes commercial"
20:59:25 * etank (n=elake@74-140-129-0.dhcp.insightbb.com) has joined #ubuntu-ohio
20:59:32 <meatballhat> etank: welcome back!

20:59:39 <hackle577> that's 3 baby yeah!
20:59:47 * hackle577 wins!
20:59:48 <goatdad13> maybe the larger stores have some deal where they don't do things like this
20:59:50 <etank> hey guys
20:59:56 <goatdad13> just playing devils advocate
21:00:07 <hackle577> possibly yes
21:00:09 <goatdad13> kids bedtime must take my leave for now
21:00:12 * Vorian would not allow such things in my store....
21:00:32 <meatballhat> goatdad13: would you mind sending me an email when you're able? :)
21:00:46 <theidiotthatisme> goatdad13: Kids first :-)

21:04:31 <theidiotthatisme> So anything else on the agenda?
21:04:35 <Vorian> yes
21:04:53 <Vorian> who wants to be an ubuntero?
21:05:01 <zerhacke> Ubuntero?
21:05:06 <theidiotthatisme> What exactly is an Ubuntero?
21:05:11 <Vorian> :)
21:05:25 * zerhacke imagines fighting bulls with a Ubuntu logo on them.
21:05:32 <Vorian> on your launchpad account....
21:05:36 <zerhacke> Oh no wait, that's a matador.
21:05:42 <Vorian> under your name it says
21:05:57 <Vorian> ubuntero: (YES) or (NO)
21:06:30 * Vorian waits whilst everyone checks their launchpad account
21:06:43 <theidiotthatisme> I'm a no
21:06:49 * etank im good
21:06:50 <zerhacke> I'm a no.
21:07:01 <hackle577> mine says No
21:07:05 * Vorian checks his
21:07:10 <Vorian> jj
21:08:38 <Vorian> hello?
21:08:42 <hackle577> err hi
21:08:50 <Vorian> sorry
21:09:01 <zerhacke> So what is this Ubuntero?
21:09:15 <hackle577> zerhacke: http://www.ubuntu.com/community/processes/newmember?highlight=%28ubunter...
21:09:17 <Vorian> so, an ubuntero is a ubuntu fanatic who signs the code of coduct
21:09:42 <Vorian> hackle577, nice
21:09:54 * zerhacke reads.
21:10:07 * theidiotthatisme is reading
21:10:09 * ChanServ gives channel operator status to Vorian
21:10:09 * PriceChild (n=pricechi@ubuntu/member/pricechild) has left #ubuntu-ohio (requested by Vorian)
21:10:09 * ChanServ removes channel operator status from Vorian
21:10:09 * PriceChild (n=pricechi@ubuntu/member/pricechild) has joined #ubuntu-ohio
21:11:11 <theidiotthatisme> So it's an Ubuntu activist
21:11:14 <Vorian> The important part of the process is signing the code of conduct
21:11:36 <Vorian> theidiotthatisme, yes! exactly! one who has signed the CoC
21:12:05 <Vorian> If you are familiar with pgp encryption, you will have no trouble with the process
21:12:26 <Vorian> if not, I am willing to stick arround and help folks through the process
21:12:33 <hackle577> perks include: an @ubuntu.com email address and logos/artwork for printing your very own Ubu business cards
21:12:34 <etank> the site actually walks you through the process pretty well
21:12:49 <Vorian> hackle577, thats ubuntu members...
21:12:53 <etank> hackle577: really?
21:12:59 <hackle577> oops
21:12:59 <etank> oh never mind
