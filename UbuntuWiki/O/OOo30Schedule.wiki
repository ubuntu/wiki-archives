'''THE DATES IN THE SCHEDULE WERE TAKEN FROM THE IntrepidReleaseSchedule'''

* ''Please do not edit''
* Freezes normally happen at the start of the given date, UTC time.  So last minute changes need to happen the day before.
* Some background information and Q&A about the Ubuntu release process can be found on TimeBasedReleases
* Compare with <nowiki>[[http://live.gnome.org/TwoPointTwentythree|GNOME release schedule]]</nowiki>
* See the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/OtherProjectSchedules|Schedules of other projects]]</nowiki>
* There are a wide variety of areas to focus on to ensure quality in the Ubuntu distribution.  The '''QA Focus''' indicates where our efforts should be focused in descending order.
