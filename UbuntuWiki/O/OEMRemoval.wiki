* '''Packages affected''': `oem-config`, desktop

=== Summary ===

An option to wipe Ubuntu or Windows from the hard disk will be added.

=== Rationale ===

=== Use cases ===

* Carol would like to install another operating system instead of Ubuntu, but her hard drive is the first device in the boot order and she finds it difficult to boot using the CD. The Ubuntu desktop observes that a bootable CD has been inserted and offers her the opportunity to reboot directly into it.

=== Implementation ===

'''This is horribly incomplete. --ColinWatson'''

* A desktop icon to reboot the computer into a CD will be added.
