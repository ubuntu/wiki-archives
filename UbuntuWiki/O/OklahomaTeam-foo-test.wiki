== Welcome! ==

This is the Oklahoma State Lo``Co Wiki. This is the site for the Ubunteros of Oklahoma! The Oklahoma Lo``Co is an Ubuntu focused Linux Users Group; all are welcome to participate, and help spread Ubuntu in the state of Oklahoma.

The Oklahoma Team is just starting.  If you have even the slightest interest in it please contact us.  If you are interested, please feel free to join the <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-us-ok|Team Mailing list]]</nowiki>, or look around the <nowiki>[[http://oklahoma.ubuntuforums.org|forums]]</nowiki>. There is also usually someone hanging out in the IRC, our channel is #ubuntu-oklahoma on irc.freenode.net:8001

== Goals ==
* Advocate the use of Ubuntu throughout the state of Oklahoma
* Provide assistance with migrating, installing, configuring and using Ubuntu
* Work with other groups such as TulsaLUG and Linux``Sig.org to improve peoples computing experience by increasing awareness as well as improving software and documentation

== How to Join ==
Although we look forward to any contributions you can make, the team has taken a little extra time to gather the information to help you get started.  We ask that everyone who would like to be a member of the Oklahoma Team read the latest version of the  <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/codeofconduct/|Code of Conduct]]</nowiki> (CoC) then sign <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/codeofconduct/1.0.1/+sign|sign the agreement]]</nowiki> before joining.

We ask that you do this because the CoC is the foundation of Ubuntu development.  Signing the CoC does mean that you will have to  <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/|register with Launchpad and create an account]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/GnuPrivacyGuardHowto|generate and upload a GnuPG key]]</nowiki>.  Think of Launchpad as the system used by Ubuntu to track and collaborate on projects.

Please contact a team member if you need additional assistance signing the CoC, the IRC channel (#ubuntu-oklahoma) is a good place to look.

Once this is done, submit your membership to the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-oklahoma|Team Launchpad]]</nowiki>, once this is done, our Team Launchpad Administrator will approve your membership and send you additional details on the team and other resources.

We look forward to having you on the team and hearing about any ideas or you might have.

== Suggestions ==
Please feel free to email us at ubuntu-us-ok@lists.ubuntu.com with any idea's you may have.
