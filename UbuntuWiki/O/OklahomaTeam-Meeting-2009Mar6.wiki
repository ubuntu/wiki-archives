2009-03-05T19:31:36  <duanedesign> Hello
2009-03-05T19:35:19  <bobodod> evening
2009-03-05T19:36:33  <duanedesign> hard to stay indoors on such a nice night
2009-03-05T19:37:31  <bobodod> that's the truth.  I think this LoCo team is spread all over the State, otherwise a get together on a restaurant patio would be great.
2009-03-05T19:38:50  *** billie has joined #ubuntu-us-ok
2009-03-05T19:39:07  <duanedesign> Definetly. Me and Wisdom got together last night at a local coffee house. We hung up a few flyers to get the word out about the Loco
2009-03-05T19:39:27  <billie> I made it
2009-03-05T19:39:30  <bobodod> awesome
2009-03-05T19:39:31  <billie> hello everyone
2009-03-05T19:39:41  <bobodod> welcome billie
2009-03-05T19:40:01  <duanedesign> There is actually a town named Loco, Oklahoma that would be perfect for meetups.
2009-03-05T19:40:31  <duanedesign> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loco,_Oklahoma
2009-03-05T19:40:55  <duanedesign> It always comes up on google when I am searching for something related to our group
2009-03-05T19:41:16  <bobodod> I bet Loco, OK is a *crazy* town.
2009-03-05T19:41:40  <bobodod> baddabing
2009-03-05T19:42:15  <duanedesign> ha
2009-03-05T19:42:36  <duanedesign> its huge 0.3 sq miles
2009-03-05T19:44:38  <bobodod> 150 people.  Can't be much to do...
2009-03-05T19:44:53  <duanedesign> wisdom said he was going to get a P.O. Box there, that would be a cool address. Oklahoma Ubuntu Loco  123 E. 1st St Loco, Oklahoma
2009-03-05T19:45:24  <bobodod> Speaking of getting together, the AZ team just setup their new Drupal site:  http://azloco.com/
2009-03-05T19:45:28  <bobodod> looks really good
2009-03-05T19:46:33  <slofgren> thanks bobodod
2009-03-05T19:47:06  <bobodod> slofgren, did you use the official "suite"?:  http://fridge.ubuntu.com/node/1827
2009-03-05T19:47:08  <duanedesign> I went to the spread ubuntu site last night looking for some presentation materials. That is gonna be a nice tool once they finish it
2009-03-05T19:47:15  <duanedesign> http://spreadubuntu.neomenlo.org/
2009-03-05T19:47:49  <slofgren> bobodod: no
2009-03-05T19:48:08  <slofgren> you guys have a nice logo
2009-03-05T19:49:29  <duanedesign> man that site is sweeeeet.
2009-03-05T19:49:49  <bobodod> duanedesign, this is the first I've heard of spreadubuntu
2009-03-05T19:52:01  <bobodod> duanedesign, did you create the OK LoCo logo?
2009-03-05T19:52:15  <duanedesign> We just recently took ours down. Nobody ever did anything with it:( So I just spiffied up the wiki.
2009-03-05T19:52:22  <duanedesign> our website
2009-03-05T19:52:31  <duanedesign> No I did not create the logo
2009-03-05T19:52:47  <duanedesign> The guy was part of the Louisiana Loco, I think
2009-03-05T19:52:57  <bobodod> right on
2009-03-05T19:53:18  <duanedesign> He had an open invitation to do a logo for any loco that wanted one. I think it was on the forums
2009-03-05T19:54:01  <bobodod> do you mean http://www.ubuntuoklahoma.org/?  I noticed tonight that it's no longer referred to from the wiki page.
2009-03-05T19:54:29  <duanedesign> bobodod: the spreadubuntu site is supposed to be a repository for all the loco materials so we can share them. Kinda like the DIY section of the wiki
2009-03-05T19:54:45  <bobodod> gotcha.  Very cool.
2009-03-05T19:54:50  <duanedesign> yes
2009-03-05T19:55:22  <bobodod> I need to get my hands on a stack of LiveCDs with informative liners to pass out to people.
2009-03-05T19:55:54  <bobodod> I haven't seen an iShipIt CD, but I bet it's exactly what I'm looking for
2009-03-05T19:56:58  <duanedesign> didnt someone from the AZ team make a sleeve
2009-03-05T19:58:10  <bobodod> yeah, I think here https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DIYMarketing
2009-03-05T20:00:49  <bobodod> well, I think it'd be great if we tried out that Drupal suite at ubuntuoklahoma.org
2009-03-05T20:04:56  <duanedesign> That AZ site looks great! I think it would be nice to have something like that. If we could just get some momentum as a team I think we could utilize something like that.
2009-03-05T20:05:20  <bobodod> Who owns the ubuntuoklahoma.org domain?
2009-03-05T20:05:51  <bobodod> I understand the AZ team is really large & active.
2009-03-05T20:11:16  <duanedesign> Steve Roemen is the contact. I emailed him when I set up the Google apps account for the Loco. He had to upload an htnl verification file for the account to be verified. I sent him an email a couple of months ago about changing the DNS entries so we coould use the ?????@ubuntuoklahoma.org emails provided through the google apps account. However I never heard anything.
2009-03-05T20:12:27  <duanedesign> So i guess the awnser is I am not sure what the arraingment is. I have had litle contact with Steve.
2009-03-05T20:13:25  <duanedesign> arraignment???? ha
2009-03-05T20:13:50  <billie> according to whois the domain is registered through Wild West Domains but no owner information available
2009-03-05T20:14:02  <bobodod> I know this is a busy time for everybody, trying to make money, dealing with taxes & whatnot.  If you think of it, send him another one, would you?  And please add me to the GApps users.
2009-03-05T20:14:18  <duanedesign> I think it would be wothwhile to get that figured out.
2009-03-05T20:14:34  <bobodod> I'm down for working on it.
2009-03-05T20:15:49  <bobodod> WildWestDomains.com, their phone number is in AZ.  lol
2009-03-05T20:16:08  <duanedesign> that would be awesome. I will contact him and find out everything I can.
2009-03-05T20:16:50  <bobodod> if you don't hear anything in by our next meeting or two, I'll try to contact him too
2009-03-05T20:17:06  <bobodod> then you can arraign him
2009-03-05T20:17:35  <duanedesign> lol
2009-03-05T20:22:09  <bobodod> well, I plan on starting out testing Drupal installs in VMs very soon.  I'm sorry to say I know very little of webdev right now, but that'll change.
