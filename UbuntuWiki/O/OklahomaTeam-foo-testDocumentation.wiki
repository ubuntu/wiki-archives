What was the last wiki or tutorial you wrote? When was the last time you or your team collectively improved the Ubuntu documentation? When was the last time you used the wiki at all? The Ubuntu Community Documentation (help.ubuntu.com/community) can still be much improved. There are still hundreds of documents to be written and other documents to be improved or updated. Contributing, as an individual or a Team, to this project benefits Ubuntu as a whole.<<BR>>

== Want to Help ==
One of the many reasons that Ubuntu is a great operating system is because it's developed by the community. You, me, and hundreds of other people join efforts in making it better each day. The Documentation Team is a group of community volunteers responsible for writing, editing and updating the system documentation that ships with the Ubuntu, Kubuntu and Edubuntu desktop operating systems. New versions of these guides are released with each new release of Ubuntu, and these are translated through the translation tool Rosetta in the same manner as all of the other applications in Ubuntu. <<BR>>

== Documentation Projects ==

The two types of documentation that the team is responsible for are:

* <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DocumentationTeam/SystemDocumentation|System Documentation]]</nowiki> - the documentation which comes with every Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Xubuntu and Edubuntu system. It includes the Ubuntu Server Guide.
* <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WikiTeam|Wiki Documentation]]</nowiki> - the help wiki is a community edited resource that anyone can edit.

For information on how to contribute, visit either of the two pages linked above. If you need help understanding the team's processes, you might want to <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DocumentationTeam/Contact|contact the team]]</nowiki>, or even <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DocumentationTeam/Mentoring|join the mentoring scheme]]</nowiki>!
