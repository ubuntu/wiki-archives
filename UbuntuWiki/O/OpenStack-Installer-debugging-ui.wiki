== Debugging the Placement UI ==

It's possible to debug the placement UI with faked MAAS data so you don't need
an actual connection (or even an install of any kind) to test UI tweaks.

First, generate a config file like this:

<pre> yaml
current_state: 0
install_type: Multi
openstack_password: ubuntu
openstack_release: juno
storage_backend: none
</pre>

(the '''storage_backend''' can be any of the valid values)

save it somewhere outside of '''~/.cloud-install/''' -- '''~/fake-maas-config.yaml''' will do.

then run openstack-status like so:

  '''$ FAKE_API_DATA=path_to_openstack-installer-sourcetree/test/fakemaas/lotsamachines openstack-status -c ~/fake-maas-config.yaml --edit-placement'''
