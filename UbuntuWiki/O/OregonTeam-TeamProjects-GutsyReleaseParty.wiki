=== Post Party ===
Lots of fun, lots of people. Most of everybody that came was from different groups so that was encouraging to see general linux community participation in the event.
I felt like the room and in general the whole place was a bit small for the group we pulled in, in the future a larger place would be good.

This was my first time at Free Geek, so I really had no idea what they had for facilities. I felt like an oven would be great for cooking papa's pizza in next time so ordering pizza would not be so expensive, we will discuss this next meeting.
