=== Roadmap ===

 {*} ''Rebooting sub-state groups'' - Discussion has taken place <nowiki>[[http://www.mail-archive.com/ubuntu-us-ohio@lists.launchpad.net/msg01333.html|on the mailing list]]</nowiki> about restarting sub-state groups.  It was <nowiki>[[http://irclogs.ubuntu.com/2013/09/15/%23ubuntu-us-oh.html#t03:27|acknowledged in IRC]]</nowiki> on September 15th that references in the wiki were removed and this was <nowiki>[[http://ohio.ubuntu-us.org/node/167|officially mentioned in the podcast]]</nowiki> ''Burning Circle''.  Currently work revolves around locating where exactly in the state members are located in population clumps by way of <nowiki>[[http://ohio.ubuntu-us.org/map/user|the member map]]</nowiki>.

            <nowiki>[[File:membermap.png]]</nowiki>

 {*} ''Increasing the number of Ubuntu Members'' - In <nowiki>[[http://ohio.ubuntu-us.org/node/164|episode 128 of]]</nowiki> ''Burning Circle'' it was noted that the leader would be speaking at Ohio Linux Fest 2013 in September about the process of becoming an Ubuntu Member during <nowiki>[[http://erielookingproductions.info/ubuntu/2013/09/44-mid-september-leader-notes|this particular UbuCon]]</nowiki> and encouraging attendees to go through the steps.  During <nowiki>[[http://ohio.ubuntu-us.org/node/149|episode 115 of]]</nowiki> ''Burning Circle'' the leader started in June pitching the notion to the membership of the social community.  Currently there have been no takers which results in this being an on-going project.

 {*} ''Migration away from Ubuntu Forums to Discourse'' - The leader <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/loco-contacts/2013-September/006503.html|responded to a call by Jorge Castro]]</nowiki> to try moving team presences toward the Discourse test platform.

=== Experience: 2013 So Far ===

 {*} ''Ubu Con at Ohio Linux Fest 2013'' - This was the community's part to Ubuntu Global Jam S-Series as <nowiki>[[http://loco.ubuntu.com/events/ubuntu-us-ohio/2504-ubucon-at-ohio-linux-fest-2013/|noted on the LoCo Portal]]</nowiki>.  

 {*} ''June 2013 Meeting'' - The meeting is <nowiki>[[http://loco.ubuntu.com/meetings/ubuntu-us-ohio/624/detail/|logged on the LoCo Portal]]</nowiki>.  This meeting report led to a <nowiki>[[http://pad.lv/1201941|bug being filed against the LoCo Portal]]</nowiki> to request flexibility be introduced.  Other 2013 meetings were reported on the wiki as transcripts such as for <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/OhioTeam/IRC20130123|January 23rd]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/OhioTeam/IRC20130128|January 28th]]</nowiki>.

 {*} ''November 2013 Meeting'' - The meeting is <nowiki>[[http://loco.ubuntu.com/meetings/ubuntu-us-ohio/682/detail/|logged on the LoCo Portal]]</nowiki>.  The Leader made a formal statement, the Verification application was discussed, and plans were set in play to work out a mission statement and long-term plans after vUDS-1311 concludes.

 {*} ''Long Term Planning'' - It must be remembered that there is no long term plan.  From <nowiki>[[http://www.mail-archive.com/ubuntu-us-ohio@lists.launchpad.net/msg01258.html|fall of the High Council in April]]</nowiki> only short-term goals were set out to be accomplished by September with Ohio Linux Fest as the climax.  With the sudden changes that took place at the start of 2013 that shocked the leadership and members of the community, there was no long-term planning for where the community wished to go.  A meeting is to be scheduled for settling long-term plans after vUDS-1311 concludes.  The <nowiki>[[http://www.mail-archive.com/ubuntu-us-ohio@lists.launchpad.net/msg01257.html|end to the High Council]]</nowiki> did not take place on the most positive of notes.

 {*} ''Podcasting'' - A podcast looking at the interests of the Ohio community is produced weekly and is released via the community's <nowiki>[[http://ohio.ubuntu-us.org/burningcircle|Drupal site]]</nowiki> with archiving also taking place through <nowiki>[[http://archive.org/search.php?query=subject%3A%22ubuntu%20ohio%22%20AND%20subject%3A%22podcast%22&sort=-publicdate|the Internet Archive]]</nowiki>.

 {*} ''Xubuntu XMir Testing'' - An Ubuntu Member in our community, <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:unit193]]</nowiki>, created and ran the Xubuntu XMir testing discussed by <nowiki>[[http://www.muktware.com/2013/08/xubuntu-offers-13-10-iso-based-on-xmir/4542|Muktware]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[http://www.webupd8.org/2013/08/xubuntu-1310-xmir-iso-available-for.html|Web Upd8]]</nowiki>, and <nowiki>[[http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTQyOTQ|Phoronix]]</nowiki>
