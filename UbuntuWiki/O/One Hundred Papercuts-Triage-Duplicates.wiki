;) You can easily '''look for''' duplicates by:

* 📡 Going to the following '''website''':
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| `https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/[DESIRED PACKAGE'S NAME]/+bugs?field.status%3Alist=TRIAGED&field.status%3Alist=INPROGRESS&field.status%3Alist=FIXCOMMITTED`
|}

* 🔍 Then, by using the '''search''' functionality of your web-browser (by pressing the "Ctrl+F" key combination), looking for bugs with similar importance and title.

===  ===

Duplicated bugs '''are''' those which describe exactly the same issue:
* 💣 Same '''cause'''.
* 🐾 Same '''steps''' to reproduce.
* 🔥 Same '''consequence'''.

/!\ When having to choose '''which duplicate''' to retain:
* 💟 Keep the one which is more '''descriptive'''.
* 🎁 '''Triage''' it as far as possible.
