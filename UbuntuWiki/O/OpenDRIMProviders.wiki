=== Summary ===

Since Karmic, OpenDRIM providers are providing basic information through CIM/WBEM infrastructure.
This specs outlines which new OpenDRIM providers should be packaged and which part of the CIM schema and CIM profiles shoul be covered.

=== Rationale ===

OpenDRIM providers have been developed for any Linux distribution.
16 new providers are ready to be included into Maverick.
However, the upstream project team would like some feedback from the Ubuntu community in order to improve their project.
A discussion beteween the OpenDRIM team and the Ubuntu staff on which providers are needed for the next Ubuntu server release, should be held.

=== Discussion notes ===

==== Current status ====
* SBLIM stack on the broker side
* OpenDRIM on the providers side

==== Maverick plans ====
* SBLIM stack
** Necessary updates
*** sfcb: 1.3.4 -> 1.3.7 (1.3.8 available at the end of May)
*** sfcc: 2.2.0 -> 2.2.1
*** cim-schema: 2.22 -> 2.25experimental
* OpenDRIM providers
** Which ones for 10.10
** Key Development schedule dates
** Upload/sponsoring support

==== Future plans ====
* sfcb to universe (schema license)
* PPU Upload rights
