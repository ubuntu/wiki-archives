== Meeting Log ==
<pre>
(07:24:00 PM) tnseditor: "This meeting is now called to order"
(07:24:01 PM) tnseditor: :-D
(07:24:05 PM) tnseditor: well
(07:24:06 PM) picard_pwns_kirk: about time
(07:24:20 PM) Derath: Aside from sorwing off a couple systems, at least one with compiz?
(07:24:22 PM) tnseditor: we're only 1 hour and 24 minutes late :-p
(07:24:27 PM) tnseditor: yes :-D
(07:24:40 PM) picard_pwns_kirk: do we have machines?
(07:24:54 PM) tnseditor: I had contacted System 76 and they said they would provide us with some to show off
(07:24:57 PM) theidiotthatisme: So far, just what we personally own
(07:25:03 PM) theidiotthatisme: and what tnseditor just said
(07:25:04 PM) theidiotthatisme: lol
(07:25:11 PM) picard_pwns_kirk: awesomecakes
(07:25:43 PM) tnseditor: and I think theidiotthatisme had something with that game company (:-p), but that was for ubucon... they would probably do OLF too
(07:25:45 PM) mm405416: is this concerning linuxfest '08
(07:25:50 PM) Derath: Hmmm... wonder if s76 would be willing to do some form of discounts for OLF goers or for loco members...
(07:26:00 PM) tnseditor: I don't know
(07:26:03 PM) tnseditor: maybe
(07:26:04 PM) mm405416: oh hey! it is
(07:26:08 PM) picard_pwns_kirk: mm405416: yeah
(07:26:09 PM) mm405416: sorry, slow tonight
(07:26:10 PM) Derath: coupon code or something...
(07:26:18 PM) tnseditor: that would be really nice of them
(07:26:19 PM) Derath: that'd push both...
(07:26:22 PM) picard_pwns_kirk: I know of some good Linux games we could show off
(07:26:28 PM) theidiotthatisme: tnseditor: Unfortunately I lost that contact, although I might be able to restablish it, I'm not sure for OLF since they are not ubuntu specific and there will already be gaming booths thre
(07:26:33 PM) theidiotthatisme: *there
(07:26:40 PM) tnseditor: oh
(07:26:43 PM) mm405416: what did you have in mind picard?
(07:26:47 PM) picard_pwns_kirk: urban terror?
(07:26:55 PM) Derath: I could show off Eternal Lands a bit... lol if my laptop will boot and there's internet access...
(07:27:04 PM) picard_pwns_kirk: oh, forgot
(07:27:06 PM) tnseditor: and I could show "I have no tomatoes" :-p
(07:27:09 PM) picard_pwns_kirk: Derath: no internet
(07:27:13 PM) ***tnseditor is a pro :-p
(07:27:21 PM) theidiotthatisme: Well if I remember correctly dont forget that they only have I believe one or power strips for a booth
(07:27:43 PM) Derath: I should be able to bring a strip if needed
(07:27:46 PM) tnseditor: we could bring some others to plug in :-p
(07:27:50 PM) ***picard_pwns_kirk uses 2 power strips for his desk alone
(07:27:51 PM) dm left the room (quit: "Leaving").
(07:27:52 PM) theidiotthatisme: But since there will be many linux distributions represented, as well linux companies, maybe we should focus on showing Ubuntu specifics?
(07:28:01 PM) tnseditor: probably
(07:28:10 PM) tnseditor: We could show wubi too
(07:28:12 PM) picard_pwns_kirk: restricted drivers manager + add/remove thing
(07:28:24 PM) theidiotthatisme: I was thinking about handouts on LoCos with contacts for different LoCo's, copies of that ubuntu magazine, and maybe CD's with ubuntu podcasts on it?
(07:28:31 PM) Derath: maybe if we have 4 (or 5) systems, ubuntu, kubuntu, xubuntu, (and I know I'm missing one or two)...
(07:28:38 PM) tnseditor: edubuntu
(07:28:41 PM) tnseditor: and server
(07:28:49 PM) picard_pwns_kirk: we could virtualize
(07:28:49 PM) tnseditor: gobuntu if you wanted also
(07:29:09 PM) tnseditor: with all that we would have to virtualize :-p
(07:29:22 PM) Derath: titim: not a bad idea... contact info for questions/information
(07:29:56 PM) theidiotthatisme: Derath: Exactly
(07:29:59 PM) Derath: tns: no problem, anything new will be beefy enough to do "normal" stuff in a openbox...
(07:30:23 PM) theidiotthatisme: I believe that part of really seperates us is the community and I think showing that strength would be a great help there
(07:30:26 PM) Derath: Only thing that would be bad would be games or cpu-intensive apps
(07:30:37 PM) Derath: in vms that is
(07:30:51 PM) Derath: err, virtualbox, not openbox... sorry
(07:31:13 PM) tnseditor: we could make CDs with tutorials (screencasts), links to UF, Ohio loco, etc.
(07:31:18 PM) tnseditor: and maybe even some LUGs
(07:32:52 PM) mm405416: obviously we're looking to show alot of the practicality behind the system
(07:32:59 PM) tnseditor: yes
(07:33:06 PM) mm405416: anyone considered just going all out for just one system
(07:33:23 PM) tnseditor: we should have 2 and maybe a laptop also
(07:33:26 PM) mm405416: maybe include a goofy little tweak, like say using a wiimote with one
(07:33:31 PM) picard_pwns_kirk: ooo
(07:33:36 PM) tnseditor: that way we could demo a few at a time
(07:33:41 PM) tnseditor: wiimote would be really cool
(07:33:47 PM) tnseditor: is it hard to set up?
(07:33:54 PM) picard_pwns_kirk: there are tutorials online
(07:33:57 PM) tnseditor: ok
(07:33:57 PM) mm405416: not from what I've gathered
(07:33:59 PM) theidiotthatisme: Anyone have a wiimote? lol
(07:34:01 PM) picard_pwns_kirk: who here has a wii
(07:34:03 PM) tnseditor: I don't :-(
(07:34:07 PM) theidiotthatisme: I dont
(07:34:20 PM) mm405416: there's alot of tutorials out there already, and last I checked, the software is improving and making things even easier
(07:34:45 PM) Derath: I have a wii... actually I won the one that Zenoss was giving away last year
(07:34:55 PM) mm405416: lucky dog
(07:34:55 PM) tnseditor: lucky
(07:34:59 PM) mm405416: I was hoping for that
(07:35:05 PM) Derath: lol Hey, I was the 4th pick!
(07:35:11 PM) mm405416: nice
(07:35:18 PM) mm405416: that truly is lucky
(07:35:36 PM) Derath: A little reminder to all: If you're going for a freebie, MAKE SURE TO PUT THE RIGHT EMAIL ADDY!!! lol and make sure it's one you check often
(07:36:16 PM) picard_pwns_kirk: lol
(07:36:45 PM) mm405416: it seems to me that ubuntu has a strong reputation going as far as stability is concerned, and it's obviously very important to showcase that
(07:36:46 PM) Derath: Anyways, back to topic... do we need a wii controller there?
(07:36:52 PM) picard_pwns_kirk: Derath: yeah
(07:36:55 PM) tnseditor: I think so :-D
(07:36:56 PM) tnseditor: :-p
(07:36:58 PM) picard_pwns_kirk: do you have a laptop?
(07:37:02 PM) mm405416: but I would also love to show that you really can do very exciting things with it
(07:37:06 PM) Derath: mm: But how do you "show" stability?
(07:37:16 PM) mm405416: haha
(07:37:17 PM) tnseditor: I do if I can be there, but I think System 76 would send some
(07:37:20 PM) mm405416: valid point derath
(07:37:28 PM) picard_pwns_kirk: if so, figure out how to configure it as a mouse
(07:37:29 PM) Derath: ppk: Yes, but I wouldn't call it reliable... in the middle of hardware failure I think...
(07:37:58 PM) mm405416: I have a couple laptops floating around
(07:38:04 PM) mm405416: two dells and a toshiba
(07:38:09 PM) picard_pwns_kirk: well, we need one for Derath
(07:38:18 PM) theidiotthatisme: I have one I'm bringing for trying software being handed out there O:-)

(07:53:59 PM) theidiotthatisme: Does anyone know if anyone attends OLF internationally or no?
(07:54:06 PM) tnseditor: I thought we could just put them on a CD with some screencasts
(07:54:08 PM) theidiotthatisme: jacob: Dont forget to order the CD's
(07:54:47 PM) theidiotthatisme: tnseditor: Dont forget then you have to buy and burn the CD's, and people will snatch them up cause they're CD's even if they dont use them
(07:54:53 PM) jacob_: theidiotthatisme: i *think* Canonical was there... once

(07:56:54 PM) thebinaryblob left the room.
(07:56:57 PM) jacob_: compared to the Hyatt also on top of the CC, which was double expensive, expensive food, and no free wifi. (but school paid for that trip, so i won't complain. :D)

(08:03:20 PM) picard_pwns_kirk: seconded
(08:03:44 PM) tnseditor: that's most of my problem with switching over
(08:03:52 PM) jacob_: theidiotthatisme: i'd be fine with that, *BUT* OLF might want someone of age to handle registrations
(08:03:56 PM) jacob_: though i'm not sure tbh
(08:04:09 PM) jacob_: depends on how they accept payment...
(08:04:28 PM) picard_pwns_kirk: brown bag underneath the tall oak tree in town square
(08:04:40 PM) tnseditor: hahaha
(08:04:59 PM) theidiotthatisme: If I had a paypal account I would do it, but I dont have one and I dont have a banking or credit card
(08:05:10 PM) theidiotthatisme: Soo..... anyone volunteer?

(08:06:31 PM) tnseditor: I've never driven that far by myself and my family probably wouldn't let me either
(08:06:40 PM) tnseditor: it was a struggle last year for the release party
(08:06:56 PM) Phoenix301: i can second that
(08:07:07 PM) jacob_: :P
(08:07:23 PM) theidiotthatisme: jacob: When does the registration end?
(08:07:23 PM) tnseditor: I didn't know I was going until about 3 hours before we left here (about 5 hours before the party)
(08:07:27 PM) ***picard_pwns_kirk hands jacob_ a text editor and an SSH client

(08:08:28 PM) tnseditor: except for you :-p
(08:08:28 PM) theidiotthatisme: jacob_:  Well if you collect the money for now even if we have to transer it to make the payment I'll make sure we can
(08:08:39 PM) jacob_: that works
(08:08:45 PM) jacob_: but we'll have to put this meeting on hold
(08:08:51 PM) jacob_: re: dmwaters global notice

(08:11:17 PM) jacob_: +1
(08:11:20 PM) Phoenix301: yeah
(08:11:20 PM) theidiotthatisme: ubucon I think has kind of died into an eventually someday sometime

(08:11:32 PM) theidiotthatisme: I say spring 2009

(08:11:56 PM) jacob_: *however* see /topic, bugjam incoming
(08:12:01 PM) jacob_: :o
(08:12:06 PM) theidiotthatisme: Spring 2009 if co plan it with OLF and continue through (it takes longer having to setup your own venue and stuff) or Fall 2009 if planning after OLF
(08:12:12 PM) tnseditor: I don't like bugs in my jam... I throw it out if that happens
(08:12:19 PM) jacob_: canonical/ubuntu wants us to do that live... but it doesn't *have* to be
(08:12:34 PM) tnseditor: the bug jam?
(08:12:45 PM) jacob_: i suggested video conferencing and they were okay with that, even endorsed it at the end
(08:12:45 PM) picard_pwns_kirk: what's a bug jam?
(08:12:50 PM) Phoenix301: i dont like jam on my bugs, i throw them out if that happens XD

(08:13:50 PM) picard_pwns_kirk: ie: the theme's brown
(08:13:55 PM) jacob_: tnseditor: triaging bugs, "drinking from the firehose," marking duplicates, testing bugs, etc
(08:14:00 PM) Phoenix301: 1 cup beetles, 2 cups sugar 1 cup pectin.. bring sugar and pectin to a boil, add pulped bugs, let set into bugjam
(08:14:02 PM) tnseditor: oh

(08:15:00 PM) ***picard_pwns_kirk isn't
(08:15:00 PM) theidiotthatisme: Do we want to hold the bug jam before OLF? And are we doing online or in person?
(08:15:05 PM) jacob_: i know vorian's on bugcontrol, being a motu an all (congrats again on that ;))
(08:15:14 PM) picard_pwns_kirk: he's afc
(08:15:41 PM) jacob_: ﻿theidiotthatisme: still needs to be planned. if things flow right, it could even be a session at olf

(08:16:52 PM) jacob_: theidiotthatisme: traditionally, they are in-person events, but i've heard of a team that did one online
(08:17:03 PM) tnseditor: we could use ustream :-p
(08:17:03 PM) jacob_: theidiotthatisme: and with video sessions, things could be even easier
(08:17:05 PM) tnseditor: or skype :-p
(08:17:08 PM) jacob_: exactly
(08:17:36 PM) picard_pwns_kirk: remember how the last gathering with webcams went

(08:19:02 PM) jacob_: theidiotthatisme: i'm the same with travel issues, so it's definitely still on the board for online
(08:19:27 PM) jacob_: bugjam is for another meeting though (i mean technically we're 2 hours into this one lol)
(08:19:28 PM) ***tnseditor probably wouldn't be available for a live meeting unless it was in Lima :-p

(08:19:46 PM) tnseditor: ok
