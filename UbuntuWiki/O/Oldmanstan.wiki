=== About Me ===
Linux user for a few years now. On and off since about 1998 (mostly off honestly). At some point I used Red Hat (forget which version) and three (3) different versions of Caldera Open Linux (yep, it really did exist!). In April or May 2005 I tried Ubuntu then deleted my Windows partition in December 2005, it was a joyous occasion *sniffle*.
