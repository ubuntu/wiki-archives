=== What is Operation Cleansweep? ===
Operation Cleansweep was launched at UDS-M by Jono Bacon.  The idea is to get the number of bugs with patches down to 0 by Maverick's release.  It is a huge undertaking considering that there are 2000 bugs with patches right now, and almost 80 new patches come in every month!  It comes down to about 2000 bugs with patches to be reviewed by the end of the release.

=== How can you help? ===
It's easy to get involved in Operation Cleansweep. Just 10 minutes of your time can make a great contribution to the project.

==== Help review patches ====
We've set a daily target of 20 bugs per day.  That should get us well on our way to reviewing all the patches in Ubuntu. We follow the <nowiki>[[ReviewersTeam-ReviewGuide#Workflow|Review Guide]]</nowiki> for reviewing patches.
