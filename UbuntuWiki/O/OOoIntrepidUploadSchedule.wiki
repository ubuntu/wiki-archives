=== Summary ===

To prevent holding up the release we are scheduling upload times for OpenOffice.org.

=== Release Note ===

This is just an informational spec.

=== Rationale ===

To prevent holding up the release we are scheduling upload times for OpenOffice.org. It takes roughly 17 hours to build on ia64, which is the slowest buildd, not to mention any time waiting to build in the queue. To give plenty of time for potential problems to be sorted out we should upload for an alpha release no later than the previous Thursday.

=== Assumptions ===

The primary assumption is that OpenOffice.org will ship within the Intrepid timeframe. This should happen barring major problems since the currently scheduled release date for OpenOffice.org 3.0 is Sep 2 and Intrepid release is scheduled for Oct 30.
