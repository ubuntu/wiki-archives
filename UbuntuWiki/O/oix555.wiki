==== IRL ====

* My activities has grown more in real life than on the Internet, since I discovered GNU/Linux and Ubuntu, I decided to promote it wherever I go, I try as best as I can to convince people to try it, and install it.

I offer all the people I convinced to install Ubuntu a technical support, maintenance in case of problems, and I help them to learn and use it better, for free of course.

* I participated to the GNU/Linux install party Second Edition, (and I helped the <nowiki>[[http://www.openmindsclub.org|OpenMinds Club]]</nowiki> team as well as I could), in the <nowiki>[[http://www.usthb.dz|Houary Boumedian Technology Sciences University]]</nowiki> in Bab Ezzouar, Algiers.

=== Goals ===

* Promote Free Software in Algeria and the Maghreb, his philosophy, and make it discover to most people.

* Ensure that free software is no longer an ''alternative'', but that proprietary software becomes the ''alternative''.

* Create an association to get to realize all that.

* Create a real active communauty in the area.

* Make a real and big free communauty on the Maghreb and work united with them.

=== Futur Projects ===

* Make discover the Maghreban ancient culture by translating softwares into Berber languages.

 I am working with the '''High Commission for Amazigh''' to create words in Berber/Amazigh language in relation with computing to translate softwares and distributions like Ubuntu and LinuxMint into this language, because these words does not exist yet, and then, use them for the first time on FreeSoftwares (I'm proud by this idea).

* Organise events and OpenDoors days to make people discover the FreeSoftware and the ''Human Being'' phylosophy.

* Create a Festival, with the tunisians and morrocains, The '''''Maghreban FreeSoftware Festival'''''.
