__TOC__

Create a page on the Ubuntu Ohio site similar to a tech support form, with the added notice that all support calls are free. Require the user to enter a phone number and a message describing the problem, or if they just want installation support.

Once the form is submitted, it is sent to a central database (linked to Drupal) where support requests are stored. To answer a request, a NU member should click on the message, preview the problem, and hit Accept to answer the call. Then, after the request is assigned to the NU member, the phone number is revealed. It is crucial that it is revealed after the acceptance and not before to prevent accidental duplicate calls by multiple people.

Once a request is assigned, the NU member should call the person via cell/skype/gizmo (might be long distance) and attempt to solve the problem. After the call, the member should report back to the support panel to mark the call as Successful or Unsuccessful. If unsuccessful, the support priority should be elevated. (We don't want a person told they will be called back if no one will!)

The system is being developed off-site from the Canonical servers, but will be brought over once finished. Anyone who wishes to preview the system before release should contact JacobPeddicord.
