== Ubuntu OCI ==

=== What is Ubuntu OCI ===
Ubuntu OCI is a minimal rootfs ready for use to build OCI/docker container base images. It is similar to <nowiki>[[Base|Ubuntu Base]]</nowiki> but contains already the modifications to make the rootfs suitable for building OCI/docker container images.
The rootfs tarballs are published under https://partner-images.canonical.com/oci/ .

=== Get involved ===
Anyone who wants to get involved with Ubuntu OCI should join #ubuntu-devel on irc.libera.chat first. Giving support to other people vary from one-line answers to solving problems including bugs. The channel is also a good place to get known before taking a bigger part of some problem, or joining the team.

Bugs should be reported on <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-images|Launchpad in the cloud-images project]]</nowiki>.
Changes to the tarballs need to be done in git on <nowiki>[[https://code.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/livecd-rootfs|the livecd-rootfs project]]</nowiki>.
