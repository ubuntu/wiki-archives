What is OEM GUI?

In Ubuntu there is an option to install as an OEM install (creates a new user wizard for when you want to sell a pc with Ubuntu pre-installed) - but - once installed, you can't change the default theme, wallpaper, etc... for the new user easily. I have set out to create a GUI to easily setup those preferences in Ubuntu.

The Plan:

A GUI much like the gnome's "appearance."  It will allow you to import themes/wallpapers from gnome-look.org and other standard tar.gz files and it will set them as the default for all new users created on an Ubuntu desktop system...  

The overall program should be used for OEM Ubuntu installations for changing the theme, and wallpaper the end user of the PC will see once he/she logs in for the first time.
