__TOC__


==== (aka) Duncan McGreggor ====

I'm currently a subcontractor for NASA, writing Clojure full-time. My previous work history is available on <nowiki>[[https://www.linkedin.com/in/oubiwann|LinkedIn]]</nowiki>.

I first heard about Linux in the mid-90s during a !DiffEq class while studying physics at university. Having started with CP\M in the 80s, and VAX/VMS, DEC's Digital UNIX, and SunOS in the 90s, I was thrilled there was a free "UNIX." My first distro was Slackware, after which I moved to !RedHat 5.2, and then to SuSE when !RedHat changed their licensing. I used Debian after being exposed to the preferences of other Twisted Python developers, and naturally moved to Ubuntu from there. I haven't looked anywhere else for my Linux needs since then :-)

I currently run Ubuntu (xfce) on my ThinkPad W550s.
