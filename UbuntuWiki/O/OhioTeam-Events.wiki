Here you will find past and future events that the Ohio Team participates in.  We do <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/OhioTeam/Events/ReleaseParty|release parties]]</nowiki> for each cycle, Ubuntu Global Jam, !ReCoLo meetings, and <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/OhioTeam/Events/OhioLinuxFest|Ohio Linux Feast (OLF)]]</nowiki>.  The first three are held in our <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/OhioTeam/ReLoCos|ReLoCo's]]</nowiki> of the state and the last one is where everyone in the team meet up.
