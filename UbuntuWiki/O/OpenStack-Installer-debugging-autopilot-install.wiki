== Debugging a failed Autopilot install ==

Majority of the time most failed Autopilot installations are due to improper configuration of MAAS. These below steps should guide you on what needs to be configured.

=== Install MAAS ===

To install MAAS, type the command below and follow the step-by-step instructions:

<pre>
sudo apt install maas
</pre>

Create your admin credentials by typing:

<pre>
sudo maas-region-admin createadmin
</pre>

=== Import Cloud images ===

* Login to the MAAS UI at http:///MAAS/
* Go to the “Images” tab and import disk images for “14.04 LTS amd64”

=== Add SSH key ===
* On the Account page, add your SSH key

=== Configure Network ===
* Go to the “Networks” tab and for each of the networks auto-created, click “Edit network” to add the default gateway and DNS server details

* Go to the “Clusters” tab, open the “Cluster master” link, hover over the row for the interface that is connected to the private network and select the edit icon (looks like a pencil — )
* Set this interface to manage DHCP and DNS
* Set the “Router IP” to the default gateway
* Fill in details for the dynamic and static ranges, remembering to leave gaps for the floating IPs
* * Dynamic range — that has as many IPs as there are total NICs connected to the network (minimum 15)
* * Static range — that has as many IPs as there are machines connected to the network
* * Floating IP range — that has as many IPs as instances that you’ll have in your cloud

=== Now you need to enlist and commission machines ===

* Ensure all machines are set to PXE boot, if possible disable all other boot options, including local disk, in the BIOS
* Power the machines on so they will all appear in the “Nodes” tab of MAAS
* Edit each machine filling in the power type and parameters
* Select all the machines and, using the “Take action” dropdown, “Commission” them.
* Wait until all machines have a “Ready” status

Once these steps have been completed MAAS should be ready to handle the Autopilot installation.
