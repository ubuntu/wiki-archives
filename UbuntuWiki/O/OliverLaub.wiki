=== Hobbies & Interests ===
* My interests are building our own house, almost everything was done by me, my wife and some friends. We started 2004 and Christmas 2006 we moved in. There are still plenty of things to do (garden wall, garden, etc.)
* Scuba diving is one of my favourite hobbies so I "upgraded" my brevet to Rescue Diver.
* Inline and ice skating are also fun.

=== Ubuntu ===
I'm pretty new to Ubuntu but I'll try to play my part in that Open Source game.
Take care, have fun and be free
Oliver
