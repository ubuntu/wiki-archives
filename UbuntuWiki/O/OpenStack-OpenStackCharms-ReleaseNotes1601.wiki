=== New Charm Features ===

==== Experimental OpenStack Mitaka Support on 14.04 ====

To deploy !OpenStack Mitaka on Ubuntu 14.04, use the 'openstack-origin' configuration option, for example:

<pre>
cat > config.yaml << EOF
nova-cloud-controller:
  openstack-origin: cloud:trusty-mitaka
EOF
juju deploy --config config.yaml nova-cloud-controller
</pre>

The charms provide initial experimental support for Mitaka; Mitaka is still in active development alongside Ubuntu 16.04 so further charm updates are expected prior to final release in April.

==== Ceph LTS Release ====

To deploy Ceph Infernalis with juju, use the 'source' configuration option, for example:

<pre>
cat > config.yaml << EOF
ceph:
  source: cloud:trusty-mitaka
EOF
juju deploy --config config.yaml ceph
</pre>

=== Upgrading ===

==== General ====

Please ensure that the keystone charm is upgraded first.

To upgrade an existing deployment to the latest charm version simply use the 'upgrade-charm' command, e.g.:

<pre>
juju upgrade-charm cinder
</pre>

Note: The networking endpoint in keystone has been renamed from quantum to neutron in-line with upstream name changes.

=== New Charm Features ===

=== Deprecation Notices ===

==== Minimum Juju version ====

!OpenStack Charm CI testing no longer validates the !OpenStack charms against versions of Juju (< 1.24) which don't have the leader election feature, used to determine leadership between peer units within a service.

Legacy leadership support will be removed from the charms over the next few development cycles, so please ensure that you are running on Juju >= 1.24.
