(08:24:11 PM) Brady_M: Vorian: that would be nice
(08:24:13 PM) ***meatballhat hasn't gotten an email response from Linux Fest peeps...
(08:24:21 PM) PWill: hey, just got my internet connection back
(08:24:28 PM) meatballhat: but I'm all for asking sabdfl to come on down :)
(08:24:47 PM) PWill: Time Warner sucks so bad
(08:24:48 PM) Vorian: yay PWill
(08:24:52 PM) PWill: brb
(08:24:56 PM) Vorian: PWill, tru dat!
(08:25:05 PM) xaphan: double true
(08:25:13 PM) skippy: I'm on the LinuxFest planning committee. I'd be happy to liason for you / him.
(08:25:20 PM) hackle577: xaphan: lol
(08:25:47 PM) Vorian: skippy, how can we help/ participate?
(08:26:33 PM) skippy: Vorian, there's discussion of extending OLF to all weekend, with the first day being "OLF University". The F2F stuff I've seen on the mailing list would be a _great_ addition to that.
(08:26:54 PM) meatballhat: skippy: ****awesome***
(08:27:21 PM) skippy: I haven't been following the mailing list too closely, but I really liked the idea of the F2F support.
(08:27:28 PM) theidiotthatisme: Has there been any progress on the module for the website for F2F?
(08:27:33 PM) skippy: If we could generate some intro to Ubuntu classes, that would be helpful too
(08:27:45 PM) theidiotthatisme: skippy: I'm your man, that would be easy :-)
(08:27:53 PM) jacobmp92: theidiotthatisme: tbh, not much since the last meeting
(08:28:15 PM) meatballhat: skippy: we're supposed to be getting some educational stuff together in partnership with OHIONET, too :)
(08:28:24 PM) theidiotthatisme: jacobmp92: Okay. I was just wondering because I was toying with adding it to the email release but I wasn't sure of it's progress
(08:28:29 PM) skippy: theidiotthatisme, If you're working on Ubuntu training, please consider making it CC-licensed! FreeGeek Columbus would love to use such material!
(08:28:45 PM) Brady_M: skippy: I can supply a killer rig to demo Feisty. BLue neon lights, get the dremmel out and carve a sick Ubuntu on the side. (ahh, ....... heaven)
(08:28:51 PM) jacobmp92: theidiotthatisme: heh, i'm opening VIM now :)
(08:28:53 PM) theidiotthatisme: skippy: All material I write myself as documentation or training projects are always released to CC or similar
(08:29:06 PM) skippy: excellent.
(08:29:29 PM) skippy: here's some more food for thought:
(08:29:35 PM) theidiotthatisme: skippy: When I finish writing my beginning materials I'll upload them to the site with a CC-license
(08:30:18 PM) skippy: some on the OLF team have expressed an interest in how-to classes on a variety of Free Software applications. Like "How do I use Gimp to remove red eye from my digital photos" type of material.
(08:30:19 PM) Vorian: theidiotthatisme, the ohio team wants to be first to market :)
(08:30:44 PM) skippy: I'm going to be advocating that kind of thing pretty strongly; and it would be an easier sell if there was a body of committed participants.
(08:31:01 PM) skippy: Gimp, Open Office, Linux, Scribus, etc etc
(08:31:02 PM) meatballhat: skippy: we are that body of peeps, to be sure :D
(08:31:04 PM) theidiotthatisme: Vorian: Dont worry, the project wont be endangered lol
(08:31:12 PM) Vorian: :)
(08:31:22 PM) skippy: Basically: how to be productive with free software, so that people can get over their fear / misunderstandings
(08:31:33 PM) theidiotthatisme: I'm really hoping the thing with the libraries goes through, I would love to start on the training classes.
(08:31:38 PM) PWill: I'm also doing things with Ohio LinuxFest
(08:31:48 PM) theidiotthatisme: Skippy: that's pretty much the goals of the Education Team ;)
(08:32:02 PM) PWill: The prices haven't been set for sponsors/booths, but I really think we should get one
(08:32:16 PM) theidiotthatisme: PWill: We as in the Ohio LoCo?
(08:32:18 PM) skippy: last year the .org booths were $75.
(08:32:36 PM) PWill: yep
(08:32:36 PM) Vorian: skippy, how big?
(08:32:44 PM) PWill: Vorian: See here: http://www.ohiolinux.org/sponsor.html
(08:32:47 PM) Vorian: we are a big team
(08:32:51 PM) Vorian: ty PWill
(08:32:54 PM) skippy: Vorian, basically one folding table along the side wall.
(08:33:08 PM) Vorian: hmmm
(08:33:09 PM) PWill: Vorian: I designed that site, by the way :-)
(08:33:10 PM) meatballhat: we can handle $75 easy :D ... heck, I'll front it myself
(08:33:26 PM) jacobmp92: PWill: nice design, i like it :)
(08:33:30 PM) hackle577: I'm a poor college student, but for Ubuntu I could chip in
(08:33:31 PM) theidiotthatisme: Are their options for larger booths/tables? And maybe we can run a donation inside the team?
(08:33:34 PM) Vorian: meatballhat, how much is platinum?
(08:33:40 PM) Vorian: or skippy ^
(08:33:45 PM) theidiotthatisme: And we can print up some things about Ubuntu, our team, and the projects
(08:33:47 PM) skippy: platinum is $5K
(08:33:56 PM) trumpintappist [n=andrewha@h226.107.29.71.ip.alltel.net] entered the room.
(08:34:04 PM) jacobmp92: $
(08:34:06 PM) Vorian: silver?
(08:34:08 PM) Vorian: hehe
(08:34:10 PM) meatballhat: HA!!! 5k .... hmmm... /me looks for piggy bank
(08:34:26 PM) PWill: That's probably not an option. I think we should try for silver
(08:34:40 PM) trumpintappist: hi meatballhat
(08:34:43 PM) Vorian: yeah, redhat inc was silver
(08:34:45 PM) theidiotthatisme: How much is silver
(08:34:47 PM) Brady_M: theidiotthatisme: speaking of libraries .... I went and talked to the local library director for mine. Instead of just giving me yay to nay, they asked me to come to the board meeting tomorrow at 7pm. All I could find on the marketing library side was a draft of the official press release. I was going to give them a bit of information, hand out the release, and give them the only last copy of 6.06 I had to show them "roughly"
(08:35:22 PM) theidiotthatisme: Brady_M: Did you need some material drafted for you for tomorrow?
(08:35:49 PM) PWill: Speaking of copies of 6.06, I went to Micro Center (ew) last night, and put Dapper discs out in front of the Vista Ultimate boxes
(08:35:54 PM) Brady_M: theidiotthatisme: yes! I'll pass it along. Has Daniel's info on the release only
(08:36:11 PM) trumpintappist left the room (quit: "Leaving").
(08:36:19 PM) meatballhat: Brady_M: the release is not yet in a state to be ... er ... released yet
(08:36:30 PM) theidiotthatisme: Brady_M: I will gladly work on or add anything or create something if you would like. Might be the little push needed to get working on more of those resources.
(08:36:51 PM) PWill: With a little sign that said "Free Desktop Linux operating system with free support until June 2009
(08:36:56 PM) PWill: "
(08:37:05 PM) hackle577: PWill is my hero lol
(08:37:10 PM) theidiotthatisme: Brady_M: But as meatballhat said, the release that will be sent to Ohionet and Oplin will be more refined
(08:37:12 PM) etank [n=etank@74-140-129-0.dhcp.insightbb.com] entered the room.
(08:37:24 PM) Brady_M: OK, well it was a surprise to me too, also one of the board members is also the tech director for all Union County schools, so I got to "impress them".
(08:37:36 PM) PWill: skippy: Do you remember the Silver prices for last year?
(08:37:50 PM) skippy: PWill, trying to find my dev.ohiolinux.org account data to look
(08:37:52 PM) jacobmp92: woot back on topic
(08:38:05 PM) PWill: ha
(08:39:03 PM) meatballhat: Brady_M: that's great ... we need the attention of more TDs
(08:39:46 PM) theidiotthatisme: meatballhat: I have to leave early tonight, unfortunately. Sometime tonight please send off an email to me on what you have, what your goals are, and what you would like to show them. Also let me know if you are doing a presentation (I.E. Impress) or just a talk. And I'll see what I can do to help you!
(08:39:58 PM) theidiotthatisme: sorry Brady_M
(08:39:59 PM) theidiotthatisme: lol
(08:40:03 PM) meatballhat: theidiotthatisme: will do ... sounds great :)
(08:40:18 PM) theidiotthatisme: Both of you send me an email, and Brady_M I'll try to fire something back by morning ok?
(08:40:28 PM) theidiotthatisme: Seee if I got that right
(08:40:31 PM) theidiotthatisme: aww you guys know what I mean
(08:40:31 PM) theidiotthatisme: lol

(08:45:45 PM) hackle577: I am on the verge of becoming the Campus Rep for the Mozilla Foundation at Miami University. I guess it couldn't hurt asking them for a small donation
