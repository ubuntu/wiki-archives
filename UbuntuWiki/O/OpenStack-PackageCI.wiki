__TOC__

==== Overview ====

The Ubuntu !OpenStack team uses automated packaging CI to build the core !OpenStack packages against a tarball generated for each upstream commit to core !OpenStack projects.

==== Published PPAs ====

CI packages are published to the following PPAs:

* <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~openstack-ubuntu-testing/+archive/ubuntu/ussuri|Ussuri Testing PPA]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~openstack-ubuntu-testing/+archive/ubuntu/train|Train Testing PPA]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~openstack-ubuntu-testing/+archive/ubuntu/stein|Stein Testing PPA]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~openstack-ubuntu-testing/+archive/ubuntu/rocky|Rocky Testing PPA]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~openstack-ubuntu-testing/+archive/ubuntu/queens|Queens Testing PPA]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~openstack-ubuntu-testing/+archive/ubuntu/newton|Mitaka Testing PPA]]</nowiki>

==== Daily Package CI process ====

The Ubuntu !OpenStack team uses packaging CI to build the core !OpenStack packages against a tarball generated for each upstream commit to core !OpenStack projects.

Following is the general process for fixing build failures:

* Check Jenkins for build failures:

** http://10.245.168.2:8080/view/Ussuri/
** http://10.245.168.2:8080/view/Train/
** http://10.245.168.2:8080/view/Stein/
** http://10.245.168.2:8080/view/Rocky/
** http://10.245.168.2:8080/view/Queens/
** http://10.245.168.2:8080/view/Mitaka/

* If a core package needs a fix:
** https://git.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-server-dev/ubuntu/+source/openstack-packaging/tree/packaging-ci-fixes.md

* If a stable dependency needs an update to fix a daily build issue, backport a version to the corresponding ppa under lp:~openstack-ubuntu-testing as well (because the actual SRU upload will take some time).

* If a new release dependency needs an update to fix a daily build issue:

** If it is an existing package, then upload it to the archive. Also backport it with the backport_package job, which will place it in the corresponding UCA staging PPA (e.g. <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-cloud-archive/+archive/ubuntu/newton-staging|newton-staging]]</nowiki>) and the corresponding trunk testing PPA (e.g. <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~openstack-ubuntu-testing/+archive/ubuntu/newton|newton]]</nowiki>).
** If a new package is required, go through the ITP process and create the package, then backport it to the testing PPA (e.g. <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~openstack-ubuntu-testing/+archive/ubuntu/newton|newton]]</nowiki>).

==== Daily CI Rotation ====

Each of the !OpenStack team members have chosen days of the week when they spend some time focusing on fixing up daily CI build failures.
