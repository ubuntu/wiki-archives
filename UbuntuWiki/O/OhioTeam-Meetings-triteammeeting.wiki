__TOC__

We have decided to have a Tri-LoCo team meeting between the Ohio, Michigan, and Chicago teams for collaboration for conferences and other events (like Ubucon). It has been decided that the meeting will be held on IRC channel #ubuntu-us-mi on Tuesday, January 22 at 8:00 p.m. EST and 7:00 p.m. Central. During the tri-meeting between the Michigan, Ohio, and Chicago teams we will discuss collaboration for conferences, ride sharing, etc.

For anyone needing help getting on IRC, just go to http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=422156 and for the channel enter #ubuntu-us-mi to join the tri-loco meeting. If you need any help, just ask on the Ohio Team's subforum (http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=191) or on the mailing list.
