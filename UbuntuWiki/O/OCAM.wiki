__TOC__

One Computer A Month (OCAM) is an initiative started by Brandon Perry in order to spread the word of Ubuntu one computer at a time. They donate to schools and homes in need of a computer for basic usage (word processing, email, and internet browsing, etc...). As the name implies, at least one computer a month is donated.

Site Home: http://ocam.volatileminds.net/

IRC: #ubuntu-ocam

* Defunct because of low resources, if you would like to still donate a computer, the IRC channel still exists*
