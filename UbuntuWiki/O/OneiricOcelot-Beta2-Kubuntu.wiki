=== Updates from the KDE community ===

==== Plasma and Applications 4.7 ====

<nowiki>[[attachment:desktop.png | <nowiki>[[File:desktop-wee.png]]</nowiki></nowiki>]]

<nowiki>[[http://kde.org/announcements/4.7/|The latest stable release of KDE's Plasma Workspaces and Applications]]</nowiki> brings new features and improvements all around. Highlights include:

* Visual updates include a new Oxygen icon theme
* A cleaner default look to Dolphin
* Gwenview's new ability to compare two or more images
* New breadcrumb feature in the Kickoff menu that simplifies navigating submenus
* More improvements in the Network Management widget
 
More details can be found <nowiki>[[http://kde.org/announcements/4.7/plasma.php|here]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[http://kde.org/announcements/4.7/applications.php|here]]</nowiki>.

==== KDE Personal Information Management Suite 4.7 ====

<nowiki>[[attachment:kontact.png | <nowiki>[[File:kontact-wee.png]]</nowiki></nowiki>]]

We’re happy to bring you the new KDEPIM suite, which includes the Kmail 2. 
The look and feel is familiar, but under the hood, most of the applications have been updated to use the <nowiki>[[http://userbase.kde.org/Glossary#Akonadi|Akonadi]]</nowiki> storage service. This will enable better email, calendar, and other PIM activities moving forward.

'''IMPORTANT''': Do note that this is a major upgrade to the mail, calendar and addressbook systems, and as such still needs usage and migration testing. While loss of data should not be an issue, it is '''''highly recommended''''' to ''back up all important data, mail, contact information, and calendars if you plan to test upgrading to 11.10''. 

==== Amarok 2.4.3 ====

<nowiki>[[attachment:amarok243.png | <nowiki>[[File:amarok243.png||width=400]]</nowiki></nowiki>]]

This new and improved version of the default music player features native support for remote NFS & SMB/CIFS collections, a better looking user interface, support for gpodder.net, as well as vastly improved reliability.

For more information have a look at the release announcements of Amarok <nowiki>[[http://amarok.kde.org/en/releases/2.4.1|2.4.1]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[http://amarok.kde.org/en/releases/2.4.3|2.4.3]]</nowiki>

==== Test Drive OpenGL ES Powered Desktop Effects ====

For those adventurous and curious, we’ve packaged the work towards using a more compatible and reliable version of OpenGL, <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_ES|OpenGL ES]]</nowiki>. This new technology is particular interesting in the not so distant future for mobile devices.

To try running your system desktop effects on OpenGL ES <nowiki>[[apt:-kde-window-manager-gles| install “kde-window-manager-gles”]]</nowiki>. More information can be found on <nowiki>[[http://blog.martin-graesslin.com/blog/2011/07/running-kwin-with-opengl-es-2-0/|Martin Gräßlin's blog]]</nowiki> (that's "graesslin").

=== New from Kubuntu ===

==== Muon Suite 1.2 ====
The Kubuntu team is proud to present our new suite of tools for installing and managing software. Installing of .deb packages, updating, and software management is all part of this new, integrated suite, specifically designed to work with Debian style package management. Check out <nowiki>[[http://jontheechidna.wordpress.com/2011/08/12/muon-suite-1-2-0-released/|Jonathan Thomas’s Blog]]</nowiki> for more info.

The Muon Software Center provides an easy-to-use way to access extra applications, games and accessories to further customize your desktop. Applications come with ratings and reviews for each application from the wider Ubuntu community, as well as with screenshot previews to help you make informed decisions.

For the budding system administrator, the Muon Package Manager provides a powerful feature set with a usability-driven interface. With its lightning-fast quick-search and extensive filtering abilities, you should have no trouble finding exactly the right package. From selective upgrades to package pinning to mass package removal, the Muon Package Manager should give you every tool you need to quickly and efficiently administer your system.

==== Low-Fat Settings ====

Kubuntu introduces Kubuntu-Low-Fat-Settings: a collection of configuration options that reduce memory usage and even speed up KDE's loading time. This will help Kubuntu run better on older, lower-end systems.

Some of the many tweaks include:

* Turning off compositing by default.
* Disabling the automatic loading of various modules, such as bluedevil, the free space notifier, some Nepomuk services, and a other components.
* Reducing the number of default Krunner plugins that are loaded automatically.
* Reducing the amount of graphical effects used in the window decoration.

Significant reductions in memory usage (up to 32%) and the subsequent savings in KDE's loading time (up to 33%) can be had simply by <nowiki>[[apt:-kubuntu-low-fat-settings | installing the package "kubuntu-low-fat-settings"]]</nowiki>!

=== From the Ubuntu Community ===

Read the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.kubuntu.org/OneiricOcelot/TechnicalOverview/Beta2|Ubuntu 11.10 Beta 2 Technical Overview]]</nowiki> for the updates on kernel drivers, better backwards compatibility for 64-bit machines, and other improvements.

== Known Problems ==
* Bug:639933 Some users may experience issues while updating from a previous version to the beta. There are proposed fixes for those brave enough to ignore the issue until officially resolved.
* Bug:805906 Shutdown in the live session under VirtualBox sometimes does not work and seems to just hang on the desktop. Just restart the computer with the power button in that case, there is no possibility of data loss.
* <nowiki>[[https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=275469|KDE Bug 275469]]</nowiki>:  A window may retain a taskbar entry after closing the application.
* Bug:855763 Installer crash is not fixed on the i386 alternate ISO, so oem-config installations are not possible from just this one image.
