Summary from Oregon team meeting at 7:30 PM on 8/17/2007

==== Attendance ====
* H264 - Moderator
* Ecalix
* tgm4883
* aaronburt
* edavis10

==== Topics ====
* Software Freedom Day
* 3rd Sunday Linux Clinics @ FreeGeek
* PNW Art Package
* Library Distribution
* Anodized aluminum Oxide Case Badges
* PNW, Oregon, and Washington becoming Official

==== Software Freedom Day ====

Dan Shufelt has more details about this event.  He was not present at the meeting to tell us more, but SFD is Sept. 15th, 2007.  AFAIK, the plans are for it to be kind of a Q&A and Install fest.  SFD can be found here http://softwarefreedomday.org/

==== Linux Clinic ====

aaronburt notified us that there is a linux clinic every 3rd Sunday of the month hosted at Free Geek by PLUG from 1-5.  It was brought up that this would be a good place for our monthly meeting.

==== PNW Art Package ====

H264 brought up the PNW Art Package.  It is just a background picture competition that will be included in Ubuntu CD's distributed by the Oregon and Washington teams.  The goal is to have pictures on the CD displaying the sights of the PNW.  More info can be found here https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PNWTeam/projects/ArtPackage  The picture should be minimum 1024x768 and should be emailed to either Dan Shufelt or H264 with the subject being PNW Art Package and your screen name.

==== Library Distribution ====

The Library Distribution is based off of this project https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PNWTeam/projects/LibraryDist

The current plan is to find libraries that currently have Ubuntu books and periodically replace the CD's in them.  Depending on the library, they may just replace the CD's themselves if we furnish them with the CD's.  The consensus was that replacing the CD with the newest released version (as of this writting, Feisty Fawn) with a note saying that it was the newest version and that some things may differ was the best idea.

For all libraries, we would like to get in touch with the person who orders Non-Fiction books (and perhaps technical books).  Our goal here is to get them to order the Official Ubuntu book (second edition).  This is more crucial for libraries that do not have any Ubuntu books currently.  Some libraries belong to a co-op and have access to a greater amount of books (some in electronic copy).  Our goal is for more libraries to carry a hard copy of these books.

On a side note, it was also discussed that libraries may be a good place to hold Ubuntu events.  They are generally located in good places and library promotion seems to be high.  Perhaps a C cubed event (Cookies, Coffee, and CD's)

==== Anodized aluminum Oxide Case Badges ====

The Massachusetts team will place an order for Ubuntu Aluminum case badges.  These are the nice case badges, not the paper stickers that look like aluminum.  (think the *shudders* Windows laptop case badges).  We will buy some from the Massachusetts team at around $.25/badge + shipping.  There are 2 options being evaluated for this.  1.  Selling this for around $.50 to recoup our costs and for future projects.  2.  Everyone kicks in some money and we give this away free at install fests (or other events).   I will try to put up a poll later in the PNW forums, they are currently down.  I will update this when I get the poll made.

==== PNW, Oregon, and Washington becoming Official ====

It's becoming that time where the PNW team may become official.  This may be difficult as the PNW is a rather large region.  If the PNW team is not made official, then both Oregon and Washington will have seperate teams, but unofficially will still be able to work together under the PNW team name.  This is purely a cosmetic change.

|-
| [19:44]
| H264
| I just happened to be at my computer :P
|-
| [19:44]
| H264
| yeah... actually I was thinking about that last night
|-
| [19:44]
| H264
| but thinking about it does no good
|-
| [19:45]
| tgm4883_laptop
| heh, there is a guy on the forums who wants to replace his bios with uefi
|-
| [19:45]
| H264

|-

|-

| Ecalix
| kk
|-
| [19:46]
| tgm4883_laptop
| ok
|-
| [19:46]
| tgm4883_laptop
| sounds good
|-
| [19:46]
| H264
| for upcoming events there is the software freedom day on the 15th apparently
|-
| [19:46]
| tgm4883_laptop
| they really should sell the aluminum case badges in the canonical store, I emailed them about it this morning
|-
| [19:46]
| tgm4883_laptop
| whoops, save that for later^
|-
| [19:47]
| H264
| heh, np
|-
| [19:47]
| H264
| and actually dshufelt has something big in mind I think
|-
| [19:47]
| H264
| for both Oregon and Washington
|-
| [19:48]
| H264
| does that sound like fun?
|-
| [19:49]
| tgm4883_laptop
| what does it entail?
|-
| [19:49]
| H264
| http://softwarefreedomday.org/
|-
| [19:49]
| tgm4883_laptop
| because if were loading every computer in the 2 states with ubuntu by force I think thats a bad idea
|-
| [19:49]
| H264
| lol, no not quite
|-
| [19:50]
| H264
| (that does sound like fun too though)
|-
| [19:50]
| tgm4883_laptop
| where would we hold it?
|-
| [19:50]
| -
| aaronburt!n=aaron@71-215-152-208.ptld.qwest.net has joined #ubuntu-oregon
|-
| [19:51]
| H264
| aaronburt: hello :)
|-
| [19:51]
| aaronburt
| howdy.
|-
| [19:52]
| aaronburt
| is a little rusty on IRC
|-
| [19:52]
| H264
| aaronburt: we were just talking about software freedom day...
|-
| [19:53]
| H264
| next month... I think dan shufelt has an idea for scope and location
|-
| [19:53]
| H264
| lol, looks like it
|-
| [19:53]
| H264
| http://www.softwarefreedomday.org/teams/northamerica/OR/Portland
|-
| [19:55]
| H264
| so it will be more of a installfest/information event
|-
| [19:57]
| H264
| is this something that we want to help out with?
|-
| [19:57]
| tgm4883_laptop
| sounds good
|-
| [19:57]
| tgm4883_laptop
| should we vote?
|-
| [19:58]
| H264
| sure
|-
| [19:59]
| H264
| edavis10: what do you think?
|-
| [19:59]
| aaronburt
| Interesting: Looks like my usual 3rd-Sunday Linux Clinic is the day after.
|-
| [19:59]
| edavis10
| sounds good to me, just need some details
|-
| [19:59]
| tgm4883_laptop
| seems like most of us are in the portland and surrounding areas
|-
| [19:59]
| H264
| yeah, dshufelt said he was going to try to make it... I could just email him asking for more information
|-
| [20:00]
| H264
| and email the ubuntu-oregon list
|-
| [20:00]
| tgm4883_laptop
| how long is the drive from tillamook to portland anyway?
|-
| [20:01]
| H264
| just over an hour
|-
| [20:01]
| tgm4883_laptop
| ah
|-
| [20:01]
| tgm4883_laptop
| you take the 5?
|-
| [20:01]
| H264
| 6
|-
| [20:01]
| tgm4883_laptop
| hmm
|-
| [20:01]
| H264
| then 26
|-
| [20:02]
| H264
| wait, the 5?
|-
| [20:02]
| tgm4883_laptop
| ok, apparently i had no idea where tillamook was
|-
| [20:02]
| tgm4883_laptop
| closes google maps
|-
| [20:02]
| H264
| heh
|-
| [20:03]
| H264
| aaronburt: I went to #orlug and asked about software freedom day, and was generally ignored, is that a kind of thing they would want to get involved with?
|-
| [20:04]
| tgm4883_laptop
| yea shoot dshufelt an email and see if we can get more info
|-
| [20:04]
| H264
| (I asked some time ago in the IRC channel)
|-
| [20:04]
| aaronburt
| H264: No idear.  I'mmostly involved with PLUG, which is mostly mailing-list-based.
|-
| [20:05]
| H264
| aaronburt: ah, ok, I should sign up on the list and ask then :]
|-
| [20:05]
| tgm4883_laptop
| do we need to order some bulk ubuntu cd's?
|-
| [20:06]
| aaronburt
| Might take too long...
|-
| [20:06]
| tgm4883_laptop
| i guess your right
|-
| [20:07]
| H264
| if everybody burned a dozen or so then I think that would do
|-
| [20:07]
| tgm4883_laptop
| otherwise we could get some other merchandise too
|-
| [20:07]
| tgm4883_laptop
| I was looking at this https://shop.canonical.com/product_info.php?currency=USD&products_id=80&osCsid=137e10779e7ee3085922298cc90feaf5
|-
| [20:08]
| H264
| aaronburt: how many CD's could be given out at such an event?
|-
| [20:08]
| aaronburt
| Excellent.  My Linux-Clinic buddy JJJ has been experimenting with making Ubuntu CDs with nice color slipcovers.
|-
| [20:08]
| aaronburt
| Um, well, we don't end up giving away many at the Clinics.
|-
| [20:08]
| H264
| heh, ok
|-
| [20:09]
| aaronburt
| Where's the SFD event and how much foot traffic might we get?
|-
| [20:09]
| aaronburt
| The Solar Expo is that weekend at the Convention Center, might be fertile ground.
|-
| [20:09]
| H264
| I'll have to ask dan shufelt who has the master plans
|-
| [20:10]
| H264
| ooo, hmm
|-
| [20:11]
| H264
| well, I will throw a few emails at him and will find out more
|-
| [20:11]
| tgm4883_laptop
| it's too bad we don't have more time, i'm thinking we would get some pretty nice pressed cd's for $47/20
|-
| [20:12]
| tgm4883_laptop
| or at least a few give away items
|-
| [20:12]
| H264
| tgm4883_laptop: I have really cool labels if you want a slick looking CD
|-
| [20:13]
| tgm4883_laptop
| is not a fan of labels
|-
| [20:13]
| tgm4883_laptop
| is not a fan of adding additional weight to any optical disk
|-
| [20:13]
| H264
| printable CDs :)
|-
| [20:14]
| tgm4883_laptop
| now that would look good too
|-
| [20:14]
| H264
| http://wneary.com/AllUbuntuLabels.tar.gz
|-
| [20:14]
| tgm4883_laptop
| whoa, large file
|-
| [20:14]
| H264
| aaronburt: you might like those labels too :)
|-
| [20:15]
| tgm4883_laptop
| my 9600 baud modem is getting pretty hot downloading that
|-
| [20:16]
| H264
| at any rate
|-
| [20:17]
| H264
| any other comments/questions/suggestions?
|-
| [20:18]
| tgm4883_laptop
| well we need more info on it, but it sounds like a good idea
|-
| [20:18]
| aaronburt
| Heh.  How 'bout we burn some and I'll bring all my fancy printed ones?  I have like 20 I ordered for the Clinic.
|-
| [20:18]
| aaronburt
| ANd heck, 7.10 might be out in 2 months...
|-
| [20:19]
| tgm4883_laptop
| do we usually just bring vanilla ubuntu or also kubuntu, edbuntu, etc?
|-
| [20:19]
| H264
| aaronburt: that would be great :)
|-
| [20:19]
| aaronburt
| Might be good to have a few of those, along with Xubuntu.
|-
| [20:20]
| aaronburt
| BTW, I'm doing a Linux Clinic this Sunday 1-5PM
|-
| [20:20]
| tgm4883_laptop
| just official ones?  Ideally, I would like to bring a few copies of Mythbuntu to future events after 7.10 gets released
|-
| [20:21]
| tgm4883_laptop
| if we want to just do official though thats cool too
|-
| [20:21]
| edavis10
| aaronburt: for PLUG right?
|-
| [20:21]
| aaronburt
| Mythbuntu?  Whazzat? </me googles> Kewl!
|-
| [20:21]
| tgm4883_laptop
| aaronburt, unfortunetly our webpage is down right now
|-
| [20:21]
| H264
| the software freedom day is next month, 7.10 is in two months ;)
|-
| [20:21]
| tgm4883_laptop
| but its starting to look like a real solid product
|-
| [20:22]
| aaronburt
| edavis10: Yeah, Linux Clinic is hosted at Free Geek, by PLUG, for anyone.
|-
| [20:22]
| tgm4883_laptop
| H264 yea i know, i was meaning after SFD
|-
| [20:22]
| H264
| ah, ok
|-
| [20:22]
| tgm4883_laptop
| the website should be back up for alpha 4 by next thursday
|-
| [20:24]
| aaronburt
| Mythubuntu has a Wikipedia entry, so it MUST be real. ;)
|-
| [20:24]
| tgm4883_laptop
| lol
|-
| [20:24]
| tgm4883_laptop
| IMO its pretty nice, a lot better than the other programs i have dealt with.
|-
| [20:24]
| H264
| aaronburt: when is your clinic thing? once? twice a month? *looks at the emails you sent me*
|-
| [20:24]
| tgm4883_laptop
| (and im not just saying that cause i work on it)
|-
| [20:24]
| aaronburt
| Once a month, 3rd Sunday, 1-5.
|-
| [20:25]
| H264
| aaronburt: alright, and how much help do you need?
|-
| [20:25]
| H264
| generally
|-
| [20:26]
| Ecalix
| btw... linux MCE is better.. although it uses mythtv site is http://www.linuxmce.org/
|-
| [20:26]
| aaronburt
| Generally, we have just the right amount of help.
|-
| [20:26]
| Ecalix
| and it runs on *buntu as well
|-
| [20:26]
| tgm4883_laptop
| eh, linuxMCE is a rip off of plutohome
|-
| [20:26]
| tgm4883_laptop
| and dont get me started on plutohome
|-
| [20:26]
| Ecalix
| linuxmce rocks! ;)
|-
| [20:27]
| tgm4883_laptop
| with that being said, I hope linuxMCE does well, but it tries to accomplish a lot more than mythbuntu does
|-
| [20:27]
| H264
| aaronburt: ok, we'll have to send mobs over to you as often as possible
|-
| [20:27]
| tgm4883_laptop
| there are a few projects i watch
|-
| [20:28]
| tgm4883_laptop
| like UbuntuHomeServer
|-
| [20:28]
| edavis10
| aaronburt: I'll be there to help out this Sunday.
|-
| [20:28]
| tgm4883_laptop
| Ecalix, how is the mythtv setup on LinuxMCE?
|-
| [20:29]
| Ecalix
| linuxmce uses mythtv iirc
|-
| [20:29]
| H264
| anyway, anything else anyone wants to add to the linux clinic and/or software freedom day?
|-
| [20:29]
| tgm4883_laptop
| nope, just waiting for more info on it from dshufelt
|-
| [20:29]
| H264
| alright
|-
| [20:29]
| Ecalix
| same
|-
| [20:30]
| tgm4883_laptop
| moving on then?
|-
| [20:30]
| H264
| aaronburt: like I said in the email, I would join you but am too far away right now
|-
| [20:30]
| H264
| yeah
|-
| [20:30]
| aaronburt
| H264: YES! please send mobs.  We love them, with pitchforks or without.
|-
| [20:30]
| aaronburt
| edavis10: excellent!  We'll have cookies and coffee.
|-
| [20:31]
| H264
| aaronburt: I figured as much :)
|-
| [20:31]
| H264
| ooo, that is worth the hour dive... why didn't you say something before?
|-
| [20:31]
| H264
| heh... anyway
|-
| [20:31]
| H264
| moving on
|-
| [20:32]
| H264
| now the PNW art package is just a background picture competition to be in ubuntu CD's distributed in the pacific northwest
|-
| [20:32]
| tgm4883_laptop
| ok
|-
| [20:32]
| H264
| many will enter, few will win
|-
| [20:33]
| tgm4883_laptop
| no purchase nessassary
|-
| [20:33]
| aaronburt
| Kewl.  I'm on the list, let us know what dshufelt sez about SFD.
|-
| [20:33]
| tgm4883_laptop
| void where prohibited
|-
| [20:33]
| aaronburt
| Heh.
|-
| [20:33]
| H264
| lol
|-
| [20:33]
| H264
| I think after removing the pictures in the current live CD, that leaves enough room for about 4 pictures
|-
| [20:34]
| H264
| 3-6 depending on the picture
|-
| [20:34]
| tgm4883_laptop
| I think that, if we have the time (and a few good artists) we should make a PNW theme
|-
| [20:34]
| tgm4883_laptop
| but i'm ok with the background idea too
|-
| [20:35]
| aaronburt
| PNW theme sounds veddy nize.
|-
| [20:35]
| aaronburt
| I still miss the nekkid people, though.
|-
| [20:35]
| H264
| dan shufelt is going to award a gift $10 card to I think each winner...
|-
| [20:35]
| tgm4883_laptop
| not sure if it would fit on the CD, but with the PPA's opening soon, it shouldn't be too much of a problem
|-
| [20:35]
| H264
| for the art package
|-
| [20:35]
| tgm4883_laptop
| are there categories or just 1st, 2nd, 3rd place
|-
| [20:36]
| H264
| uhh, I think just each person?
|-
| [20:36]
| H264
| each picture that wins is just as much a winner as the next
|-
| [20:36]
| tgm4883_laptop
| ok
|-
| [20:37]
| tgm4883_laptop
| just wanted to know if there was categories
|-
| [20:38]
| H264
| https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PNWTeam/projects/ArtPackage
|-
| [20:39]
| H264
| not much more information, but I think a vote will happen some time with in a couple months
|-
| [20:39]
| tgm4883_laptop
| sounds good
|-
| [20:39]
| H264
| it should probably be right after the 7.10 launch
|-
| [20:39]
| tgm4883_laptop
| do we have a prefered resolution?
|-
| [20:40]
| tgm4883_laptop
| 10240X7680?
|-
| [20:40]
| H264
| I think what the default resolution is for the CD
|-
| [20:40]
| H264
| 1600xsomething
|-
| [20:40]
| tgm4883_laptop
| ah
|-
| [20:41]
| tgm4883_laptop
| I'm planning on 16x10 unless thats a problem
|-
| [20:41]
| tgm4883_laptop
| i suppose i could crop for 4x3
|-
| [20:41]
| H264
| my flower picture won't make it because it is only 1024x768 :(
|-
| [20:41]
| tgm4883_laptop
| gutsy's pretty nice, widescreen OOB on my E1505
|-
| [20:41]
| aaronburt
| H264: Dang.
|-
| [20:41]
| aaronburt
| gotta go soon.
|-
| [20:42]
| H264
| aaronburt: ok
|-
| [20:42]
| tgm4883_laptop
| starts drawing a stick figure

|-
| [20:44]
| H264
| :)
|-
| [20:44]
| tgm4883_laptop
| starts scanning the mona lisa
|-
| [20:44]
| edavis10
| I can tell the difference between green and red but thats about all....
|-
| [20:44]
| tgm4883_laptop
| uh yea
|-
| [20:45]
| Ecalix
| i dont do art...
|-
| [20:45]
| edavis10
| looks at his plain black background
|-
| [20:45]
| tgm4883_laptop
| i will try to put something nice together
|-
| [20:45]
| H264
| Ecalix: me neither, but I can take alright pictures...
|-
| [20:45]
| H264
| haha
|-
| [20:45]
| tgm4883_laptop
| starts planning trips to nice places in oregon
|-
| [20:45]
| Ecalix
| i even suck at that... got a 5mp cam and it shows how much i suck more than my cam phone
|-
| [20:46]
| tgm4883_laptop
| thats one thing im getting better at, digital camera pics
|-
| [20:46]
| H264
| Ecalix: heh, well, only if you want to ;)
|-
| [20:46]
| tgm4883_laptop
| I have a few im proud of
|-
| [20:46]
| H264
| tgm4883_laptop: good, I need competition :)
|-
| [20:48]
| tgm4883_laptop
| well my gf has been bugging me to put together some pics from our trips this summer, so now I have another reason to do so
|-
| [20:48]
| H264
| great :)
|-
| [20:48]
| H264
| and a theme would be nice... but by that time compiz-fusion will be enabled by default...
|-
| [20:48]
| tgm4883_laptop
| yep, so it will have to be an emerald theme
|-
| [20:49]
| tgm4883_laptop
| or at least a login screen
|-
| [20:49]
| tgm4883_laptop
| and usplas
|-
| [20:49]
| tgm4883_laptop
| h
|-
| [20:49]
| H264
| still a little too far down the road to see ahead...
|-
| [20:49]
| tgm4883_laptop
| not running gutsy yet?
|-
| [20:49]
| H264
| no, I guess not...
|-
| [20:50]
| tgm4883_laptop
| i just installed it today on my laptop
|-
| [20:50]
| H264
| and?
|-
| [20:50]
| tgm4883_laptop
| works pretty good
|-
| [20:50]
| Ecalix
| its running on this system with out any issues
|-
| [20:50]
| tgm4883_laptop
| had a little trouble getting flash to work with the flash in the 64-bit repos, but nothing simple64 couldn't handle
|-
| [20:51]
| Ecalix
| found it better to remove the light version of compiz on it and install the full blown version of it
|-
| [20:51]
| tgm4883_laptop
| light ver?
|-
| [20:51]
| Ecalix
| yeah... the "desktop effects"
|-
| [20:52]
| tgm4883_laptop
| no effects, normal effects, and extra effects?
|-
| [20:52]
| tgm4883_laptop
| i just enabled normal effects and installed compizconfigmanager
|-
| [20:53]
| Ecalix
| thats probably all i needed to do then... the config manager that is
|-
| [20:53]
| H264
| isn't that what compiz-tray-icon is?
|-
| [20:53]
| tgm4883_laptop
| yea, im not sure what the normal and extra settings are, i like to fine tune
|-
| [20:53]
| Ecalix
| the extra is the extra non supported plugins
|-
| [20:53]
| tgm4883_laptop
| i think compiz-tray-icon opens compizconfigmanager
|-
| [20:54]
| tgm4883_laptop
| and turns compiz on and off quickly
|-
| [20:54]
| H264
| yeah, you can also set a few different things through it
|-
| [20:54]
| H264
| like number of desktop sides
|-
| [20:54]
| tgm4883_laptop
| is emerald still the themer for compiz?
|-
| [20:54]
| H264
| from a cube to a triangle
|-
| [20:55]
| Ecalix
| emerald is not that good
|-
| [20:55]
| tgm4883_laptop
| whats better then?
|-
| [20:55]
| Ecalix
| its just title bars... its better to just get a good theme you like
|-
| [20:55]
| tgm4883_laptop
| like the PNW theme? :)
|-
| [20:55]
| H264
| heh
|-
| [20:55]
| Ecalix
| like i use this one http://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php?content=45829
|-
| [20:56]
| tgm4883_laptop
| oh yea, i saw that one, nice
|-
| [20:56]
| tgm4883_laptop
| so your saying just run metacity themes?
|-
| [20:57]
| Ecalix
| well... gtk 2.x...
|-
| [20:57]
| Ecalix
| but yes, just use the default theme manager
|-
| [20:57]
| tgm4883_laptop
| ah
|-
| [20:57]
| tgm4883_laptop
| i always got confused when trying to figure out what themes went wher
|-
| [20:58]
| H264
| yeah... I'll have to change this one I am using
|-
| [20:58]
| H264
| anyway
|-
| [20:58]
| H264
| anything else about the PNW art package?
|-
| [20:59]
| H264
| just email any pictures to me or dan shufelt
|-
| [20:59]
| tgm4883_laptop
| well
|-
| [20:59]
| tgm4883_laptop
| oh nm
|-
| [20:59]
| H264
| ..?
|-
| [20:59]
| tgm4883_laptop
| we will have to see if I have time for a theme first
|-
| [21:00]
| tgm4883_laptop
| but if we could put those on a PPA it would be kinda neat
|-
| [21:00]
| H264
| I was not really talking about a full blown theme, but alright
|-
| [21:00]
| H264
| heh
|-
| [21:00]
| tgm4883_laptop
| well just the pictures though
|-
| [21:00]
| tgm4883_laptop
| those could go in a PPA
|-
| [21:00]
| H264
| PPA?
|-
| [21:01]
| tgm4883_laptop
| in case anyone wants to get our pictures
|-
| [21:01]
| tgm4883_laptop
| personal package archive
|-
| [21:01]
| tgm4883_laptop
| it's in beta right now
|-
| [21:01]
| H264
| ah, ok
|-
| [21:01]
| H264
| hmm
|-
| [21:01]
| tgm4883_laptop
| also, when we did install parties, it would be easier to grab it off the net
|-
| [21:02]
| H264
| yeah...
|-
| [21:02]
| tgm4883_laptop
| anyway, we can figure that out later
|-
| [21:02]
| tgm4883_laptop
| just something to think about
|-
| [21:02]
| H264
| Zelut has lots of bandwidth and is torrenting all the time
|-
| [21:03]
| H264
| might ask him to put a little something on his server so we could download it on occasion :)
|-
| [21:03]
| tgm4883_laptop
| right, but it may be easier to add and push new pictures and such out of a PPA
|-
| [21:03]
| H264
| ok
|-
| [21:04]
| tgm4883_laptop
| alright, next?
|-
| [21:04]
| H264
| yeah, next, sorry
|-
| [21:05]
| H264
| the library distribution is largely based off of the PNW one https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PNWTeam/projects/LibraryDist
|-
| [21:06]
| H264
| I was thinking about simply starting with each library having a Ubuntu book or two and occasionally restocking the back of them with CD's
|-
| [21:06]
| tgm4883_laptop
| that sounds feasible
|-
| [21:07]
| tgm4883_laptop
| isn't there a new book coming out for gutsy?
|-
| [21:08]
| H264
| the second edition of the official Ubuntu book come out like a couple weeks ago...
|-
| [21:08]
| H264
| *came
|-
| [21:08]
| tgm4883_laptop
| sweet
|-
| [21:08]
| H264
| so no updates for a while for that...
|-
| [21:08]
| H264
| Lord_Dicranius and I glanced at the number of libraries in Oregon
|-
| [21:08]
| tgm4883_laptop
| we should probably pick a few
|-
| [21:09]
| H264
| there is about 200 of them... ;)
|-
| [21:09]
| tgm4883_laptop
| start with 3 or 4?
|-
| [21:09]
| H264
| however many of them could already have Ubuntu books
|-
| [21:09]
| tgm4883_laptop
| ah
|-
| [21:09]
| tgm4883_laptop
| good though
|-
| [21:09]
| tgm4883_laptop
| t
|-
| [21:10]
| H264
| edavis10: do you know if your local library has an Ubuntu book?
|-
| [21:10]
| edavis10
| let me check
|-
| [21:11]
| tgm4883_laptop
| looks like stayton and salem each have a copy
|-
| [21:11]
| tgm4883_laptop
| wait, whats the official book called
|-
| [21:11]
| H264
| I talked to my local library and they said that they would restock the back of the book with CD's if provided with some
|-
| [21:12]
| edavis10
| The official Ubuntu book
|-
| [21:12]
| tgm4883_laptop
| oh
|-
| -
| -
| insert massive freenode split here
|-
| [21:23]
| tgm4883_laptop
| brb
|-
| [21:24]
| H264
| back
|-
| [21:25]
| H264
| sorry, had some family stuff to do
|-
| [21:25]
| H264
| :)
|-
| [21:26]
| tgm4883_laptop
| back
|-
| [21:27]
| H264
| who all did I lose?
|-
| [21:27]
| tgm4883_laptop
| edavis10 is still here
|-
| [21:27]
| tgm4883_laptop
| looks like the net split fixed itself
|-
| [21:28]
| H264
| anyway, where were we?
|-
| [21:28]
| tgm4883_laptop
| um
|-
| [21:29]
| tgm4883_laptop
| getting new ubuntu books to some libraries
|-
| [21:29]
| H264
| oh yeah
|-
| [21:29]
| tgm4883_laptop
| now the ones that i found are from 2006, so those should be ok
|-
| [21:29]
| H264
| ok
|-
| [21:29]
| tgm4883_laptop
| also, both those libraries are in the chemeketa library network
|-
| [21:30]
| H264
| like I said, I talked to my local library and they said that they would restock the back of the book with CD's if provided with some
|-
| [21:30]
| tgm4883_laptop
| they weren't the official books, but the exerpts looked ok to me
|-
| [21:30]
| H264
| so if I burned 10 and gave them to the library, they would refill as necessary
|-
| [21:31]
| H264
| however libraries will probably vary regarding policy
|-
| [21:31]
| tgm4883_laptop
| im not sure if this book contains a cd
|-
| [21:32]
| H264
| you could always make a place for a CD ;)
|-
| [21:32]
| tgm4883_laptop
| yep it does
|-
| [21:32]
| tgm4883_laptop
| had to look in a different area
|-
| [21:33]
| tgm4883_laptop
| heres a question though, should we put new cd's in (a la feisty) or should we put in cd's that the book originally contained
|-
| [21:34]
| H264
| I would think sweeping the libraries and replacing the CDs with up to date ones would be good ;)
|-
| [21:34]
| tgm4883_laptop
| ok
|-
| [21:34]
| H264
| but then again, some of the things in the book will not be the some
|-
| [21:34]
| H264
| *same
|-
| [21:35]
| tgm4883_laptop
| maybe an insert saying that this is an updated version of the cd
|-
| [21:35]
| H264
| hmm
|-
| [21:36]
| tgm4883_laptop
| or introducing an updated book into the system (ie 1 or 2 updated books for the entire chemeketa library system)
|-
| [21:36]
| H264
| the other thing I was thinking for the library would be a DVD case with some information about getting help in oregon and some of the basics about Ubuntu use and installing from the CD
|-
| [21:37]
| H264
| hmm
|-
| [21:37]
| H264
| how would a new book be introduced?
|-
| [21:37]
| tgm4883_laptop
| not exactly sure, but thats a question for the librarian
|-
| [21:37]
| H264
| edavis10: you still with us?
|-
| [21:38]
| tgm4883_laptop
| i dont know how libraries decide to get new books or where they come from
|-
| [21:38]
| H264
| yeah... I think they have a pot to get as many books as they see fit, and a ranking order of books to get
|-
| [21:39]
| tgm4883_laptop
| in that case, if we start asking now, maybe in a few years the ubuntu book will be at the top of the list
|-
| [21:39]
| H264
| haha :)
|-
| [21:40]
| tgm4883_laptop
| it reminds me of that scene from the shawshank redemption
|-
| [21:40]
| tgm4883_laptop
| we just have to write a letter every week
|-
| [21:40]
| H264
| heh
|-
| [21:41]
| tgm4883_laptop
| also, if we did that, we may help influence them in getting the official book, rather than the one they have now
|-
| [21:41]
| edavis10
| I'm here
|-
| [21:41]
| H264
| I was talking to my local librarian, and he was saying that normally there is a person that is head of getting books for each kind of book... like non-fiction
|-
| [21:41]
| tgm4883_laptop
| so its settled then, edavis10 is going to drive to every library and give them copies of ubuntu
|-
| [21:42]
| edavis10
| k
|-
| [21:42]
| H264
| that would be the person to ask to talk to
|-
| [21:42]
| edavis10
| might help if I had a car  :)
|-
| [21:42]
| tgm4883_laptop
| ok
|-
| [21:42]
| H264
| edavis10: I have a list of 200 that you can start with
|-
| [21:42]
| tgm4883_laptop
| nope, we're only providing you with a stick and a plastic bag
|-
| [21:43]
| H264
| edavis10: after that I have all the branches to cover
|-
| [21:43]
| edavis10
| :(
|-
| [21:43]
| tgm4883_laptop
| good news though
|-
| [21:43]
| tgm4883_laptop
| we're going to throw in a fresh pair of socks
|-
| [21:44]
| edavis10
| thinks about switching to Debian
|-
| [21:44]
| H264
| edavis10: I'll let you use my bicycle ;)
|-
| [21:44]
| tgm4883_laptop
| quickly emails some debian guys
|-
| [21:44]
| H264
| haha
|-
| [21:45]
| tgm4883_laptop
| i don't think libraries would have a problem receiving a free book either
|-
| [21:46]
| tgm4883_laptop
| as a test, we could introduce a book that way
|-
| [21:46]
| tgm4883_laptop
| whats it, about $25?
|-
| [21:46]
| H264
| I think amazon sells the official Ubuntu book for $30
|-
| [21:46]
| edavis10

|-
| [21:46]
| H264
| $27
|-
| [21:47]
| tgm4883_laptop
| ?
|-
| [21:47]
| tgm4883_laptop
| 23.09
|-
| [21:47]
| H264
| ah, they changed the price then... good :)
|-
| [21:49]
| H264
| any other ideas for reaching libraries?
|-
| [21:50]
| edavis10
| Where I used to live the library would let community groups have simple events.  Like the quilting groups, etc.
|-
| [21:50]
| H264
| hmm
|-
| [21:50]
| tgm4883_laptop
| nope, i think the book idea is a good idea.  Perhaps maybe some fliers with upcoming install fests
|-
| [21:51]
| H264
| edavis10: actually, now that you mention it, I think there was something small like that at my library not too long ago
|-
| [21:53]
| H264
| hmm
|-
| [21:53]
| H264
| edavis10: what sort of event were you thinking?
|-
| [21:55]
| edavis10
| dunno, I just remember those things at my library got a lot of free promotion.
|-
| [21:55]
| H264
| hmm
|-
| [21:56]
| edavis10
| Q & A? Training about a topic?
|-
| [21:56]
| edavis10
| cookies and coffee and cds
|-
| [21:56]
| tgm4883_laptop
| c cubed
|-
| [21:57]
| H264
| and have the linux clinic over as well...
|-
| [21:57]
| H264
| sure sounds like fun to me :)
|-
| [21:58]
| H264
| we will have to look at some of the libraries to see what they could do
|-
| [22:00]
| H264
| alright
|-
| [22:00]
| tgm4883_laptop
| I just had a look in Summit (another group of libraries) and they have a couple different ubuntu books
|-
| [22:01]
| H264
| ok
|-
| [22:01]
| tgm4883_laptop
| mostly electronic books, but some hard copies
|-
| [22:02]
| H264
| we will have to gang up with one or two of the other oregon linux groups and see what we could do at a library sometime
|-
| [22:02]
| tgm4883_laptop
| agreed
|-
| [22:02]
| H264
| and look at policy and such...
|-
| [22:03]
| tgm4883_laptop
| well summit is the educational libraries, UO, UW, WOU are the ones i know
|-
| [22:03]
| H264
| ok
|-
| [22:03]
| H264
| colleges are good places to hold events too
|-
| [22:04]
| H264
| anyhoo
|-
| [22:04]
| tgm4883_laptop
| ok, so whats next?
|-
| [22:05]
| H264
| uhh, looks like we get to move on to other
|-
| [22:05]
| H264
| unless something else should be brought up about team projects
|-
| [22:06]
| H264
| nothing else?
|-
| [22:06]
| tgm4883_laptop
| nope, i think these are good
|-
| [22:06]
| H264
| very good
|-
| [22:07]
| H264
| now anodized aluminum oxide computer case badges
|-
| [22:07]
| tgm4883_laptop
| ah
|-
| [22:07]
| tgm4883_laptop
| I have an email in to the canonical store waiting to hear back from them
|-
| [22:07]
| tgm4883_laptop
| currently can only get them off ebay
|-
| [22:08]
| H264
| really?
|-
| [22:08]
| tgm4883_laptop
| yep
|-
| [22:08]
| H264
| o.0
|-
| [22:08]
| H264
| they need high quality badges for their high quality OS :)
|-
| [22:09]
| edavis10
| Can't find them on ebay
|-
| [22:09]
| H264
| hmm, well I never looked...
|-
| [22:10]
| H264
| so... my question
|-
| [22:10]
| H264
| I put down 400 but said that number could vary
|-
| [22:10]
| H264
| the cost will be roughly $0.25 each
|-
| [22:11]
| edavis10
| I could use some.  FreeGeek mentioned selling them in their store.
|-
| [22:11]
| H264
| could we sell 200 of them at $0.5 each?
|-
| [22:12]
| H264
| or 100 at $1 each?
|-
| [22:13]
| edavis10
| are we trying to raise money or awareness with them?
|-
| [22:13]
| H264
| no, I am trying to get my money back ;)
|-
| [22:13]
| tgm4883_laptop
| isn't the cost roughly .40
|-
| [22:14]

| I can't find the ebay ones anymore,
|-
| [22:14]
| H264
| no, they got enough people to order 10,000 of them
|-
| [22:15]
| tgm4883_laptop
| but the guy had lots, and for all sorts ones, red hat, mepis, suse, I think i even saw a trustix
|-
| [22:15]
| H264
| which puts the price at $0.24 (and a tiny amount for shipping)
|-
| [22:15]
| H264
| hmm
|-
| [22:15]
| H264
| were they anodized aluminum? ;)
|-
| [22:16]
| tgm4883_laptop
| i think so, it has been awhile since i looked at it
|-
| [22:16]
| H264
| ok
|-
| [22:16]
| tgm4883_laptop
| im trying to find the thread in the ubuntuforums
|-
| [22:16]
| H264
| how much did they go for?

|-
| [22:17]
| edavis10
| Can save 3% buy not using PayPal.  ~$7 shipping
|-
| [22:18]
| H264
| so if we sell $100 worth we could give the rest away
|-
| [22:18]
| H264
| at install fests and such
|-
| [22:18]
| H264
| for each person that gets Ubuntu installed
|-
| [22:18]
| tgm4883_laptop
| they looked exactly like the massachusetts ones
|-
| [22:19]
| H264
| is that a good way to go about it?
|-
| [22:19]
| H264
| unles everybody on the team wants to plunk $10 or $15 to help me out with them
|-
| [22:19]
| H264
| and just give them away
|-
| [22:20]
| H264
| or other ideas?
|-
| [22:20]
| tgm4883_laptop
| wait, you know the windows vista capable stickers?
|-
| [22:20]
| edavis10
| H264: I can prob go in for 100 of them.
|-
| -
| -
| insert internet connection droppage
|-
| [22:28]
| H264
| edavis10: if you want 100 of them then I could bump the order up 50
|-
| [22:29]
| H264
| I think we could we sell $10 worth to each LUG group...
|-
| [22:29]
| H264
| (or more)
|-
| [22:31]
| edavis10
| and if not, I will just have to buy more computers for them
|-
| [22:31]
| H264
| lol
|-
| [22:31]
| tgm4883_laptop
| how much did we say they were?
|-
| [22:31]
| H264
| $0.25 each at my cost
|-
| [22:32]
| edavis10
| I am really thinking about getting some to FreeGeek.  Im pretty sure the systems they build use Feisty.
|-
| [22:32]
| tgm4883_laptop
| nice
|-
| [22:32]
| H264
| I'v never been there
|-
| [22:32]
| edavis10
| I will know more Wednesday'ish
|-
| [22:33]
| H264
| the only LUG thing I have really been to was at OSU
|-
| [22:33]
| edavis10
| PLUG?
|-
| [22:33]
| H264
| at an install fest
|-
| [22:33]
| tgm4883_laptop
| i'd kick in some money so we could give them away
|-
| [22:33]
| H264
| lol, ok
|-
| [22:34]
| tgm4883_laptop
| i wouldn't want people coming to learn about ubuntu then trying to charge them for a sticker
|-
| -
| -
| insert dad deciding to install a USB card right _now_ :)
|-
| [22:56]
| H264
| edavis10: are you still there?
|-
| [22:56]
| edavis10
| yes
|-
| [22:56]
| H264
| tgm4883_laptop: how about you?
|-
| [22:56]
| H264
| edavis10: what did I miss (again)
|-
| [22:57]
| edavis10
| what did you last see?
|-
| [22:57]
| H264
| uhh
|-
| [22:57]
| H264
| I said yeah
|-
| [22:57]
| H264
| <tgm4883_laptop> i wouldn't want people coming to learn about ubuntu then trying to charge them for a sticker
|-
| [22:57]
| H264
| <H264> yeah
|-
| [22:57]
| edavis10
| your yeah never came
|-
| [22:58]
| edavis10
| 22:33 < tgm4883_laptop> you got to have some freebies
|-
| [22:58]
| edavis10
| 22:33 < edavis10> I would fell best if they were given away, sold at cost, or given to a non-profit to sell for funding.
|-
| [22:58]
| edavis10
| 22:35 < tgm4883_laptop> ideally, it would be best if we could get these from the canonical store, as I think they could get away with ordering a lot more and having ubuntu, kubuntu, and xubuntu and keeping it around the same price for large orders
|-
| [22:58]
| edavis10
| 22:37 < tgm4883_laptop> now all we need is the kevin mitnick business card
|-
| [22:58]
| edavis10
| then me asking what is next
|-
| [22:58]
| H264
| heh
|-
| [22:59]
| edavis10
| about time for me to unplug
|-
| [23:00]
| H264
| BTW this is a very disorganized not-the-way-things-should-go kind of meeting
|-
| [23:00]
| H264
| heh
|-
| [23:00]
| H264
| next is possible future meeting places
|-
| [23:00]
| H264
| you know...
|-
| [23:01]
| H264
| we could just meet at the linux clinic or something every month
|-
| [23:02]
| edavis10
| that sounds good.  IRC is fine for planning/business type stuff also.
|-
| [23:03]
| tgm4883_laptop
| where is the linux clinic at again?
|-
| [23:03]
| H264
| free geek
|-
| [23:03]
| tgm4883_laptop
| same place every month?
|-
| [23:03]
| edavis10
| yes
|-
| [23:04]
| H264
| yeah
|-
| [23:04]

| [23:04]
| edavis10

| [23:04]
| tgm4883_laptop

| edavis10
| Mailing list for the General LUG - http://lists.pdxlinux.org/mailman/listinfo/plug
|-
| [23:05]
| tgm4883_laptop
| where to park in portland
|-
| [23:05]
| H264
| for a few hours?
|-
| [23:05]
| edavis10
| 1pm to 5pm I believe
|-
| [23:05]
| H264
| ok
|-
| [23:05]
| edavis10
| I think FreeGeek has some parking
|-
| [23:05]
| H264
| I was told like 3 times, I should know by now
|-
| [23:07]
| edavis10
| http://lists.pdxlinux.org/mailman/listinfo/  - More lists including ride share
|-
| [23:07]
| H264
| in future months I would not likely be able to go there till abit later
|-
| [23:07]
| H264
| on sundays
|-
| [23:09]
| edavis10
| H264: email me about the badges if you hear anything about them.  I can spend about $25 on them right now.
|-
| [23:09]
| H264
| edavis10: alright
|-
| [23:09]
| edavis10
| edavis10 at gmail dot com
|-
| [23:09]
| H264
| edavis10: I will likely just stick with the 400, I think 400 is about right for now
|-
| [23:09]
| edavis10
| night all
|-
| [23:09]
| H264
| there will likely be more
|-
| [23:10]
| H264
| edavis10: good night
|-
| [23:10]
| H264
| *sigh*
|-
| [23:10]
| H264
| I guess meetings can only get better
|-
| [23:11]
| H264
| tgm4883_laptop: there was one last thing I wanted to mention
|-
| [23:13]
| tgm4883_laptop
| yep
|-
| [23:13]
| H264
| that is that PNW is trying to become official...
|-
| [23:13]
| H264
| however things could get a little ugly
|-
| [23:13]
| H264
| because everybody else is state or city based teams
|-
| [23:13]
| tgm4883_laptop
| how so
|-
| [23:13]
| tgm4883_laptop
| ah
|-
| [23:14]
| tgm4883_laptop
| i dont think it should be a problem
|-
| [23:14]
| H264
| and I honestly don't think anything would be gained over Washington and Oregon becoming official
|-
| [23:14]
| tgm4883_laptop
| as there loco teams as in localization
|-
| [23:15]
| tgm4883_laptop
| i suppose they could say it isn't local enough
|-
| [23:15]
| tgm4883_laptop
| but the size of the teams
|-
| [23:16]
| H264
| the idea is that they want everybody to be able to get together for events and such...
|-
| [23:16]
| tgm4883_laptop
| ah
|-
| [23:16]
| H264
| PNW _is_ a little large for that
|-
| [23:16]
| tgm4883_laptop
| true
|-
| [23:16]
| tgm4883_laptop
| tough call i guess
|-
| [23:16]
| H264
| and again, I don't think much of anything is gained by having PNW becoming official
|-
| [23:17]
| H264
| as opposed to Oregon and Washington becoming official
|-
| [23:18]
| tgm4883_laptop
| if they have a problem with PNW becoming official, theres nothing saying two loco teams can't do stuff together
|-
| [23:18]
| H264
| right, that's the other thing
|-
| [23:19]
| H264
| and there is lots of talk both ways in the community council
|-
| [23:19]
| H264
| for and against
|-
| [23:19]
| tgm4883_laptop
| for and against working together?
|-
| [23:20]
| H264
| no, for and against having PNW become official
|-
| [23:20]
| H264
| *becoming
|-
| [23:20]
| tgm4883_laptop
| ah
|-
| [23:21]
| H264
| I think avoiding conflict is important, esp. when the work around is just as easy
|-
| [23:21]
| tgm4883_laptop
| yep
|-
| [23:22]
| tgm4883_laptop
| it would be nice to be official, and maybe we could argue that it really is the northern oregon/southern washington loco
|-
| [23:22]
| tgm4883_laptop
| size wise its about the same geographical area as oregon
|-
| [23:23]
| H264
| yeah
|-
| [23:24]
| H264
| if they want to allow PNW to become official, then great, but I don't think it should be pushed
|-
| [23:24]
| tgm4883_laptop
| yep, if they dont like PNW, i dont have a problem with them being seperate
|-
| [23:25]
| H264
| well, they do like PNW, but not it becoming official as much...
|-
| [23:25]
| tgm4883_laptop
| who decides?
|-
| [23:26]
| H264
| the community council, and some even higher officials
|-
| [23:26]
| H264
| mark shuttleworth threw a couple thoughts in the email list too
|-
| [23:27]
| tgm4883_laptop
| for or against?
|-
| [23:27]
| H264
| for
|-
| [23:27]
| tgm4883_laptop
| well thats good news
|-
| [23:28]
| H264
| heh, yeah
|-
| [23:28]
| H264
| I don't know... I'm just saying that as Oregon we should do our best and let the officials decide
|-
| [23:29]
| tgm4883_laptop
| yep, either way it only changes our name.  We would still function the same
|-
| [23:29]
| H264
| yeah
|-
| [23:31]
| H264
| dan shufelt put a poll email list kind of thing, there was one person that said go for it all the way... I just put my thoughts up (basically what I just told you)
|-
| [23:32]
| tgm4883_laptop
| well im with you, its no biggie if we are not PNW officially
|-
| [23:32]
| H264
| I was going to ask the rest of the team but that faded down to be just you :/
|-
| [23:33]
| tgm4883_laptop
| sweet, that means that the vote is unanamous
|-
| [23:33]
| H264
| haha
|-
| [23:34]
| H264
| all of Oregon is apposed to conflict where avoidable, dan shufelt: don't push it, Oregon and hopefully Washington will do what they can if PNW goes either way
|-
| [23:35]
| H264
| :)
|-
| [23:36]
| H264
| I'll likely bring this up later to everybody else
|-
| [23:36]
| tgm4883_laptop
| sounds good
|-
| [23:38]
| H264
| is there _anything_ else?
|-
| [23:38]
| tgm4883_laptop
| i dont think so
|-
| [23:39]
| H264
| hopefully the next meeting will be more stream lined
|-
| [23:39]
| H264
| with more people
|-
| [23:39]
| tgm4883_laptop
| yea
|-
| [23:39]
| H264
| heh
|-
| [23:39]
| tgm4883_laptop
| a reminder email would help
|-
| [23:40]
| H264
| yeah
|-
| [23:40]
| H264
| remind me to send a reminder email
|-
| [23:40]
| tgm4883_laptop
| ok
|-
| [23:40]
| H264
| heh :)
|-
| [23:40]
| tgm4883_laptop
| as long as you remind me to
|-
| [23:41]
| H264
| right
|-
| [23:41]
| H264
| I guess that calls it quits (some time ago)
|-
| [23:41]
| H264
| quit
|}
