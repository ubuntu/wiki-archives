Opunity, what is it? It will be ideas from other social-networks combined into one solution. How wants to follow 200+ network just to share different things? Where you are, what you are doing, what you are thinking, what you'd like to share.

That's where Opunity comes into play. It'll have functions from Facebook/Diaspora, Twitter/Identi.ca, Foursquare, Reddit, StumbleUpon, and many other social-networks combined into one.
