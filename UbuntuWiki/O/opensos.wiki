Hi friends,

I’m Amrith Akurugoda, from Sri Lanka. My mother language was Sinhalese also we called Sinhala language. 

I’m a web designer & running for my own business. Working with html, xml, php, sql, JavaScript… You know :) ,  coding is my work & my life. My main job was web designing it’s all so my hobby too. Developing & hosting web site is my other works. But sometimes I make systems all so we called programs, using vb, .net, c++, & java. And sometime create 3d animation & advertising programs too. 

I didn’t tell you I have more experience or I’m a one or other. Because I know I want to learn much more for everything. I like to help people, meet people & Contact people.  If anyone need help & can I help them? I like to help them. 

Anyway, 
Thanks for everything.
Have A Good Day!
