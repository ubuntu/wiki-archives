=== OpenPGP ===

OpenPGP, PGP and GnuPG / GPG are often used interchangeably - a common mistake.

* '''OpenPGP''' is technically a '''proposed standard''' although it is widely used.
* '''PGP''' is an acronym for Pretty Good Privacy, a computer program which provides cryptographic privacy and authentication. 
* '''GnuPG''' is an abbreviation for Gnu Privacy Guard, another computer program which provides cryptographic privacy and authentication. 
* '''gpg''' is the name of the binary executable file for GnuPG in Gnu/Linux- and Unix-nased operating systems.
* '''Enigmail''' is not equivalent to '''PGP''', it implements OpenPGP encryption and digital signatures for the Thunderbird email application by using '''GnuPG''' in Ubuntu.

PGP and GnuPG are implementations of the OpenPGP standard. To find out more about those see:
