__TOC__


This page is basically to give you a glimpse of what should be done during an On Air! session.

When doing a session, someone from the On Air! team (host) will set up everything that is G+ related. For that, the only thing you need to do is add Ubuntu On``Air to your circles before the session (at least a couple hours). You should also tell the host if you would like to use IRC or Disqus, so ubuntuonair.com can be set up before your session.
