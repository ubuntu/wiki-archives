=== About Me ===
Hi, I'm from Iceland, currently living in Montreal, QC, Canada. I've been programming since I was 15, back then in Turbo Pascal making mouse enabled dos applications. Now I'm mostly programming in javascript, with a bit of everyting tossed in :) I'm very intested in <nowiki>[[http://enyojs.com/| Enyo]]</nowiki> and do a lot of projects on that. I've been apart of Ubuntu since it didn't have a name yet, varying my contributions, now mostly using it and installing it on every computer I get my hands on.
