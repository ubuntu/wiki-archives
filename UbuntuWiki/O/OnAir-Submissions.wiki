Subject: Ubuntu On Air! Session Submission

Hello, Ubuntu on Air! team! I would like to submit a session on "How to make ice cubes". I would like it to be
held on January 8th, 2013, at 17:00 UTC. My friends Jane Doe and Carla Coe will be working on the session with
me, but only I (John Smith) will go On Air. I do have experience with On Air sessions, you can watch my past
sessions here [0]. This is related to the Ubuntu Cooking Team, and is also Classroom related.

Thanks for your help!

John Smith
