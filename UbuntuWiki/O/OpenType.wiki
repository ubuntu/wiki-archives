__TOC__

OpenType is a scalable format for computer fonts, initially developed by Microsoft, later joined by Adobe Systems.

=== OpenType Support in Ubuntu ===
Ubuntu makes use of OpenType fonts via the FreeType library (an open source scalable font renderer that supports Type 1, TrueType, and OpenType fonts, in addition to a number of less common formats).
