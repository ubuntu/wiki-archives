'''Presentations:'''

A good presentation on how to profile a new user to Ubuntu & good troubleshooting practices:

===== Structure Of Support =====
Many of support documentation will be used from the following areas:
* Ohio Education Team
* Ohio New User Team
* Beginners Team
* Official wiki documentation
This flow chart shows the structure information for new users & '''New User Team''' members. This would be a quick reference guide for common issues for the '''New User Team''' which can be accessed to resolve issues with verified tested results, and improve new users experience with Ubuntu. To reduce redundancy of work already done by both Official and Community sites. Many of the links will point to specific troubleshooting steps for easy access.

The goal is to make this like a troubleshooting database. There might be information that a team member may not know, or might not remember all the steps to get from point to point. The result of the project would do the following:

* Allow team members easy "cut & paste" instructions to send to a new user needing assistance on a specific problem: via email or message board.
* Allow team members quick access to knowledge in troubleshooting a specific application or service that works in a Ubuntu Linux environment.
* Growth in knowledge for team members assisting new users.
* Help team members determine issues new members may experience are software or hardware related. (IE: If the problem is due to hardware incompatibility issue which causes problems with video, sound, or installation)
* Giving team members knowledge that could be useful in becoming certified partner, and quite possibly a new career!

The Beginners Development Team will have a maintained list of troubleshooting wikis, websites, and documentation steps  created  for use at: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Beginners/Development

'''The Beginners Guide Project'''

This is a FAQ designed with a new user in mind being developed by the beginners team. If you like to contribute to this project, please read more about the goals on the related thread explaining the sections at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=380509 .
