__TOC__

== Summary ==

* We discussed preliminary plans for a Hardy Heron release party.  For now at least we have decided to have a few different places for parties.  The parties would be at the same time and we would have a webcast setup to bring them together.  

* Ubucon 2008 was discussed.  We discussed the possibility of having Ubucon at the Columbus Metropolitan Library (Hilliard).  

* Various other topics were discussed like normal. :-)

(09:11:11 PM) tnseditor: right
(09:11:35 PM) tnseditor: I would think they would have internet, but we need to make sure
(09:11:46 PM) picard_pwns_kirk: we might need collapsible tables
(09:11:59 PM) seisen: once we do that we can see if the library is where we might be able to have it
(09:12:06 PM) tnseditor: right
(09:12:51 PM) tnseditor: we also need to see if there is any bandwidth limits and stuff
(09:13:25 PM) picard_pwns_kirk: we might want to arrange for speakers too
(09:13:40 PM) tnseditor: like people or for music :-p
(09:13:44 PM) tnseditor: people?
(09:14:20 PM) seisen: see you guys later

(09:15:29 PM) tnseditor: I wonder if they would let that many people on
(09:15:32 PM) picard_pwns_kirk: we can use one computer as a gateway
(09:15:41 PM) picard_pwns_kirk: and create a LAN
(09:16:05 PM) tnseditor: oh
(09:16:09 PM) picard_pwns_kirk: as long as we don't torrent, I doubt they'll notice
(09:16:44 PM) tnseditor: ok
(09:17:04 PM) tnseditor: I think we will have our own server there too, so that will probably help the load
(09:17:22 PM) ***picard_pwns_kirk can help set up

(09:45:14 PM) tnseditor: does your stuff work?
(09:45:31 PM) penguinapprentic: will these booths be free or will you be charging a fee?
(09:45:39 PM) tnseditor: they will be free
(09:46:14 PM) penguinapprentic: Ok, because I don't think the library will permit an event if you're charging patrons
(09:46:45 PM) tnseditor: the only thing we may sell is the games from Linux Game publishing
(09:46:51 PM) Delvien: sup

(10:11:08 PM) penguinapprentic: is there space beneath the fan?
(10:11:18 PM) Phineas: little bit
(10:12:44 PM) penguinapprentic: you need a tool like tweezers or a hemostat that will fit in the opening to squeeze the pins from beneath the fan, then the fan will lift off
(10:13:00 PM) Phineas: hemostat?
(10:13:12 PM) picard_pwns_kirk: google knows all
