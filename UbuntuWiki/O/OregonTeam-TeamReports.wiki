__TOC__

Welcome to the Oregon Team reporting page. 

Every month we should be filling this page with bullet points indicating the summary of some of the work we have been working on. As you work on something, try to summarise it here. 

A few guidelines for how to write good points:

* Keep it simple and short - single sentences are best. :)
* Try to summarize your work and not be over-detailed - we don't need to know specifics, just a summary of the kind of work involved
* Where possible, include relevant links.

The deadline for Team Report edits for a particular month is the first Sunday of the next month. Please do not edit month reports after that deadline, or add events to team reports before they actually take place.

At the end of each month (hopefully before the deadline), someone will come through and migrate your notes into a report for the respective month. Thanks for your efforts in keeping good records of our activities.

More information is available on Ubuntu's TeamReports page and <nowiki>[[BuildingCommunity-TeamReporting-HowTo|HowTo]]</nowiki>.
