My stock replies page as greasemonkey scripts dont work in chromium and the original Responses page contains too much.

=== A duplicate ===
When making a bug report a duplicate of another it is important to communicate to the reporter that any discussion regarding the bug should take place in the master bug.  Keep in mind that NUMBER is a placeholder and should be the number of the master bug report.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <tablestyle="background-color: #eee"> Thanks for the bug report. This particular bug has already been reported and is a duplicate of bug NUMBER, so is being marked as such. Any further discussion regarding the bug should occur in the other report. Feel free to report any other bugs you may find. :)
|}

=== Incomplete bugs without a response from submitter ===
In the event that a bug has been in the "Incomplete" state for more than 4 weeks, meaning it has not received a response to a request for more information, please send a gentle reminder with something like:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <tablestyle="background-color: #eee">We'd like to figure out what's causing this bug for you, but we haven't heard back from you in a while.  Could you please provide the requested information?  Thanks!
|}

If, after an additional 2 weeks, the reporter still hasn't responded __and there is no way someone can work with the bug__, the bug status should be changed to "Invalid" with a comment similar to:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <tablestyle="background-color: #eee"> We are closing this bug report as it lacks the information, described in the previous comments, we need to investigate the problem further. However, please reopen it if you can give us the missing information and don't hesitate to submit bug reports in the future.
|}

=== Missing Steps to Recreate Bug ===

=== A bug that should be handled upstream ===

If you are sure the reported bug is not caused by the packaging for Ubuntu, it should usually be sent upstream by someone affected by the bug. If appropriate, replace GNOME with the organization behind the software (see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bugs/Upstream/ for available organizations):

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <tablestyle="background-color: #eee">Thank you for taking the time to report this bug and helping to make Ubuntu better. The issue you are reporting is an upstream one and it would be nice if somebody having it could send the bug to the developers of the software by following the instructions at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bugs/Upstream/GNOME. If you have done so, please tell us the number of the upstream bug (or the link), so we can add a bugwatch that will inform us about its status. Thanks in advance.
|}

If you have already pointed out that the reported bug is an upstream one, but there hasn't been any feedback about the requested upstream bug for 2 weeks, the reporter (or someone else affected by the bug) might have forgotten it. If that's the case, you should ask if someone has already forwarded the bug upstream and can tell you the number of the upstream bug:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <tablestyle="background-color: #eee"> Is there any news about this bug? Has someone affected by this bug sent the report upstream? May you tell us the bug number? Thanks in advance.
|}

However, if you have already sent the bug upstream, you should leave a comment stating where the upstream bug can be found:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <tablestyle="background-color: #eee"> Thank you for your bug report. This bug has been reported to the developers of the software. You can track it and make comments at:
|}

=== Not described well ===

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <tablestyle="background-color: #eee"> Thank you for taking the time to report this bug and helping to make Ubuntu better. Unfortunately, we cannot work on this bug because your description didn't include enough information.  You may find it helpful to read "How to report bugs effectively" http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html. We'd be grateful if you would then provide a more complete description of the problem.<<BR>><<BR>> We have instructions on debugging some types of problems at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingProcedures <<BR>><<BR>>At a minimum, we need:<<BR>>1. the specific steps or actions you took that caused you to encounter the problem,<<BR>>2. the behavior you expected, and<<BR>>3. the behavior you actually encountered (in as much detail as possible).<<BR>>Thanks!

=== About an obsolete version of the software for reporter's release ===

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <tablestyle="background-color: #eee"> Thank you for taking the time to report this bug and helping to make Ubuntu better. However, according to this report, you are not using the most recent version of this package for your Ubuntu release. Please upgrade to the most recent version and let us know if you are still having this issue. Thanks in advance.
