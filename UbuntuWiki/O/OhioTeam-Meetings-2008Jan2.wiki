<pre>
<jacob> if i can find my the links here
<tnseditor> ok
<jacob> here we go: the poll results
<Phoenix301_> oh boy! *like a little kid*
<jacob> hehe
<tnseditor> :-p
<jacob> tnseditor & Delvien: you both got a full Yes on the polls. you okay with being on the council?
<Delvien> Yerp
<tnseditor> yeppers!
<jacob> ok that was easy, 3 to go
<tnseditor> hi seisen
<jacob> hey seisen
<jacob> seisen: you also got a yes on the polls. would you like to be on the council?
<seisen> yes
<jacob> 3 down, 2 to go
<jacob> actually nvm
<tnseditor> :-)
<jacob> i'm me and theidiotthatisme just left
<tnseditor> :-p
<jacob> i'll say yes to whatever i ask myself :P
<tnseditor> I don't know what he is going to do though.
<tnseditor> hahaha
<jacob> theidiotthatisme will most likely say yes but i will wait until he returns
<tnseditor> yes
<jacob> ok, so now i have to sign into the membership panel here...
<jacob> and ctrl+f for names
<Delvien> So this means 5 members on the council ?
<jacob> yup
<jacob> seems to be
<Delvien> Thought there were only supposed to be 3
<jacob> i don't believe we set a limit... or did we?
<Delvien> 3 council members
* jacob looks up
<Delvien> because we had the teams led by the council members
<jacob> true
<jacob> however i don't think we had to have everyone on a subteam, can anyone confirm?
<tnseditor> I thought it was just a general council and then some of them would be on the subteams
<seisen> that is what I assumed
<Phoenix301_> i cant confirm sorry, but it does seem like it was just a general council that lead the subteams as one
<jacob> that's what i was thinking
<Phoenix301_> isnt there a log on the wiki?
<Phoenix301_> it might be in there
<jacob> well, i'm going to go ahead and add y'all (cept for theidiotthatisme for now) onto LP
<tnseditor> thanks Jacob
<jacob> and we'll debate this subteams thing tonight
<jacob> because i can't think of a thing for the comment field i'm just screaming into it
<Delvien> omg
<Delvien> I just saved a bunch of money on my car insurance!
<jacob> by switching to geico?
<Delvien> Nationwide actually
<seisen> lol
<tnseditor> haha
<jacob> :P
<Phoenix301_> by staying out of an accident?
<Phoenix301_> :p
<Delvien> yeah
<jacob> ^
<tnseditor> good job :-)
<jacob> i'm going to GIMP up a picture of two thoughts of organization i'm having for this council
<jacob> chat on until then :D
<tnseditor> ok
<Delvien> wow
<Delvien> thats an extra 50$ a month im going to be saving
<Delvien> OMGOMGOMGOMGOGM
<Delvien> yay
<jacob> nice
<tnseditor> in a few months you can buy a new router (sorry I just can't get over it)
<Delvien> haha
<Delvien> tell em to return it
<Delvien> simple enough
<Delvien> what brand did they buy anyway?
<tnseditor> no idea
<tnseditor> he got off right after I scolded him :-p
<tnseditor> the thing is is that I have talked to him about different wireless routers... he's the one that brought it up, asked questions, and seemed to be interested. I bet I wasted 30 minutes on it
<tnseditor> but there's been several other issues where he has talked to me about something and then does something completely different
<Delvien> Well does his router have a built in WOL ?
<Delvien> I doubt it
<Delvien> Does his router have HotSpot HTTP redirect ?
<Delvien> I doubt it
<Delvien> Does his router have the power to heal cancer, and make babies like mine?
<Delvien> I doubt it
<tnseditor> I bet it's just an average Wireless N
<tnseditor> hahahaha
<Delvien> Wireless N lol
<Delvien> waste of money
<Phoenix301_> Wireless Nothing
<tnseditor> ha
<Delvien> Wireless Nerfherders
<tnseditor> for his purpose especially
* Delvien is listening to Daft Punk - Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger
<jacob> okay i'm doing really bad at drawing this out
<tnseditor> I bet he/ his parents think their internet will be faster (even though I explained that it will actually be slower by sharing it between 2-3 computers)
<Phoenix301_> you should of let me do it :p
<jacob> so i might just explain it :P
<tnseditor> :-p
<Delvien> jacob do what i did, draw it on a piece of paper, and take a picture
<jacob> actually never mind, this is a trivial launchpad thing
<jacob> true Delvien :P
<Delvien> jacob we kind of already discussed team structure .
<jacob> Delvien: i know, this is just a LP organizational thing
<Phoenix301_> well, if we decide on what to do i can make it look nice and pretty at another time
<jacob> which again is really trivial
<tnseditor> Trivial Pursuit?
<tnseditor> :-p
<jacob> hehe
<jacob> it's just to do with having a council team be the owner of the ohio team vs having 5 admins of the team
<tnseditor> what's the difference?
<jacob> now that i think of it i think the latter is preferred anyway, since the loco admins want a team contact to send CDs to
<Delvien> jacob http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=6satao0&s=1,
<jacob> really really trivial thing tnseditor, i don't know why i'm bringing it up :P
<tnseditor> :-p
<jacob> though that makes me think of something
<jacob> Delvien: hehe
<jacob> you know how we get 200 CDs from shipit (used to be 500 :( )
<tnseditor> ?
<seisen> 500?
<jacob> for those panera parties and whatnot
<tnseditor> yes I know we get some
<tnseditor> just never knew that there were ever 500
<jacob> yeah it was 500 before the US loco project began and a whole bunch of locos appeared
<jacob> about a year ago
<tnseditor> :-p
<jacob> anyway
<jacob> i haven't poked whoever it may be to get contact info on where to ship those yet
<tnseditor> oh
<jacob> does anyone in particular want to hold them to take to the release parties/events/whatever?
<tnseditor> I would, but I never know for sure if I can
<Delvien> I will
<tnseditor> (come to an event)
<Phoenix301_> same here, i would be willing to if i knew that i could commit to being at the events
<jacob> you all duke it out, as i'm shady on being available for some events at times
<Delvien> I can make it to every meeting indef. unless I meet an insanely beautiful woman who will take all of my time (doubtfull)
<jacob> hehe
<Phoenix301_> well, Delvien said he would be willing to a minute ago, sounds like he is the only one who seems to be available
<seisen> nice
<tnseditor> ok
<Phoenix301_> :)
<tnseditor> go for it :-)
<jacob> ok Delvien email me a shipping address
<jacob> and i'll forward that along
<Delvien> Your email :P?
<jacob> yup
<Delvien> nm got it
<jacob> jpeddicord@ubuntu.com; you see it at all the list mailings :P
<jacob> actually i always forget to set the right from addy :P
<Delvien> sent it to your gmail sorry
<jacob> no prob, they funnel to the same
<Delvien> kk
<Delvien> my next goal, get an @ubuntu.com email addy
<jacob> i will get on that then :D
<jacob> hehe
<Delvien> :P
<seisen> we can help you with that
<Delvien> Ok, so what are we on with the meeting?
<Delvien> Cause i have a topic if we are in between
<jacob> well, i guess we have subteams, but go ahead Delvien
<Delvien> Ok so we have the 3 teams, Marketing, Education, Communication, who are the leaders of those ?
<jacob> that's what we'll figure out at some point, however as anthony isn't here we might want to wait
<tnseditor> ok
<Phoenix301_> isnt this the same disscussion as the subteams thing?
<jacob> Phoenix301_: this is figuring out who is going to lead them
<Phoenix301_> ahh, okay
<jacob> okay it seems i manually request for the CDs when the time comes in a few months
* jacob starrs Delvien's address in gmail
<Delvien> Ill handle that if I can jacob
<Delvien> Just when time comes, we will get together and talk about it
<jacob> kk
<jacob> actually that reminds me of yet another thing
<tnseditor> some other trivial pursuit?
<tnseditor> :-p
<jacob> team contact
<jacob> do you all care if i remain as the team contact? all it is is communicating with loco mailing lists
<Delvien> cool with me
<seisen> thats fine
<tnseditor> absolutely not :-p
<jacob> ok
<tnseditor> just kidding :-p
<jacob> yay less paperwork
<jacob> s/paper/web
<tnseditor> :-)
<Phoenix301_> real quick on the subteam leader thing, i think it should be stressed that the point of the council is to collectively lead, so maybe rather than saying who is the leader of a subteam, stress that it isnt necessarily a separate leadership but a position of being the head of a subteam within the council.
<theidiotthatisme> :-)
<Phoenix301_> ogga booga
<tnseditor> welcome back theidiotthatisme
<theidiotthatisme> ty
<tnseditor> welcome snap-|
<jacob> good point Phoenix301_, which could make my trivial point a little less non-trivial
<jacob> wb theidiotthatisme
<theidiotthatisme> ty jacob
<jacob> quick question theidiotthatisme, you got a yes on the polls; are you okay with being on the council?
<Delvien> but at the sametime Pheonix301_ you dont want too many people to "lead" its all about condensing and making it simple, Simplicity = success
<Delvien> a leader doesnt nec mean boss
<jacob> indeed
<theidiotthatisme> Jacob: Absolutely
<jacob> kk
* jacob marks in launchpad
<theidiotthatisme> If anything comes up, I'll let everyone know by mailing list
<jacob> and then there were 5
<Phoenix301_> thats sort of what i was trying to say, that labeling certain people as the leaders of specific subteams complicates it further, and to instead just sort of put a responsiblity that keeps it from really sounding like a boss position
<Delvien> Thats what it is :) you got it right
<jacob> :D
<seisen> \o/
<tnseditor> :-)
<jacob> subteam leadership: we need a leader for communication, a leader for education, and one for marketing
<jacob> aaaannnd.... go!
<theidiotthatisme> *pops everyone*
<tnseditor> grand :-p
<Delvien> Education <--
<jacob> i'm fine with lurking around on any of them
<Vorian> *rolls eyes*
<Vorian> :P
<tnseditor> Communication for me?
* jacob rolls eyes back at Vorian :D
<Delvien> shoosh Vorian
<tnseditor> nice of you to join us vorian
<jacob> that leaves marketing undebated; anyone?
<Vorian> *suggests someone let a forum admin know who the communication tl will be*
<jacob> mm hmm
<Delvien> hold on a sec
<jacob> i'll ping you Vorian whenever
<Vorian> jacob: kk :)
<Delvien> I take a step back, Ill go for communication instead
<Delvien> oh
<Delvien> Idk lol
<jacob> :P
<jacob> everyone wants forum moderator lol
<Delvien> tnseditor what would you like to do ?
<tnseditor> communication :-p
<Delvien> blah
<Delvien> haha
<Phoenix301_> well this makes things interesting
<tnseditor> :-p
<Delvien> Ill arm wrestle you for it :D
<seisen> well then I will take education and whoever spends a lot of time on the forums should be the forum moderator
<tnseditor> virtual arm wresting :-p
<tnseditor> :-D
<seisen> at least that is my 2 cents
<theidiotthatisme> seisen: I second you for Education
<jacob> any marketing goons out there? :D
<seisen> so we have a wrestling match for communication and nobody interested in marketing
<tnseditor> that's sad :-p
<Phoenix301_> this is how they should settle presidential elections :p "I will arm wrestle you"
<jacob> haha
<tnseditor> haha
<Vorian> pfft, marketing should be the easiest, most fun, and highest profile team
* Delvien whistles innocently, and talcs up his hand
<jacob> i'll set marketing to be council owned unless anyone wants it....?
<Vorian> it's what the loco is really all about, right?
<jacob> yeah, marketing aint too hard really
<seisen> so what does the marketing team entail
<tnseditor> I think everyone kinda markets anyways
<Vorian> umm
<Vorian> OLF
<jacob> spreading ubuntu, handing out ohio loco business cards, events, etc
<Vorian> Ubucon
<Vorian> Press Releases
<Vorian> viral marketing
* seisen thinks
<Vorian> etc...
<jacob> if you blog a lot, this is for you
<Vorian> I will be chillin with the guys of OLF this year
<Delvien> thats cool Vorian
<jacob> o rly?
<Vorian> and gal
<seisen> I don't have a blog currently but I thought about creating one
<Delvien> jacob im thinking..
<jacob> heh heh heh
<Vorian> seisen: wordpress, it's free and not stupid like (blogspot)
* Vorian hides
<jacob> just throwing this out there: ubuntu members have blogs on planet.ubuntu.com
<Delvien> true
<Vorian> mwahaha
<Vorian> but!
<jacob> idk how connected that is with anything.... but y'know ;)
<Vorian> there is an agregation service for any ubuntu user
<jacob> ubuntu-users
<jacob> but the planet is where it's at, eh?
<Vorian> aye
<Vorian> hold on, let me get a link
<jacob> think of it this way
<Vorian> http://ubuntuweblogs.org/
<jacob> if you do any sort of marketing people will remember you when using ubuntu
<Vorian> http://ubuntuweblogs.org/submit.html
<Vorian> and, I have connections with the UWN if you need an article with publicity
<jacob> *cough* boredandbloggin
<Delvien> Since seisen has education, and tnseditor isnt saying anything about me wanting communication :P Ill put a vote in for me being marketing.
<jacob> where did he go btw... haven't seen him on irc for a while
<tnseditor> hello
<Vorian> he hang out in our secret ubuntu-us-* channel :)
<jacob> hello
<jacob> hehe
<tnseditor> I've been on a router hunt :-p
<Delvien> tnseditor what say you ?
<jacob> oh duh boredandbloggin is second on the channel list
<jacob> lol
<tnseditor> (I can't let this go, can I) :-p
<tnseditor> trying to figure out which one he bought
<tnseditor> I have come up with a dlink for $80 and a Linksys for $100
<seisen> Devien if you want education you can have it and I will do marketing or ......
<jacob> hehe tnseditor should be a politician
<Delvien> tnseditor So how do we settle this, I want communication, and you do.
<tnseditor> maybe co-leaders?
<tnseditor> I really wouldn't mind that
<jacob> you *could,* but LP still requires one person to be the team "owner"
<Delvien> isnt it a one man job?
<jacob> here's another thing
<jacob> the ohio loco forum isn't that active anyway... so it ain't like there's much to do in there :P
<jacob> (not that it can't be active however)
<tnseditor> it used to be
<Delvien> K make me marketing then to make it easy
<Delvien> unless someone has an objection?
<tnseditor> maybe we could have new topics
<jacob> Delvien: nope, none here
<tnseditor> Delvien, that is fine :-)
<Delvien> good, now I have to learn how to blog lol
<tnseditor> hahaha
<tnseditor> have fun :-p
<jacob> so right now we have Delvien as marketing, tnseditor as communication, and seisen as education, correct?
<tnseditor> yep
<jacob> theidiotthatisme: you haven't said much; any thoughts?
<theidiotthatisme> I have a lot going on sorry :-(
<jacob> np
<theidiotthatisme> So it's hard to keep up with the meeting
<Delvien> jacob that works out perfect too, because ill be handling the cds too
<jacob> most important theidiotthatisme is the lines in [21:00]
<Delvien> redundant statement ftw,
<jacob> hehe
<jacob> good point Delvien
<theidiotthatisme> jacob: I dont have timestamps :-P
<jacob> ack
<theidiotthatisme> But I got who's who :-P
<jacob> ok then
<Delvien> who's who? we arent in a Lotus Note database
<Delvien> dubya tee eff
<jacob> i'll transfer communication to tnseditor and contact dan buch to transfer marketing to Delvien
<tnseditor> ok
<Delvien> ah
<Delvien> meatballhat right?
<jacob> theidiotthatisme whenever you have time go ahead and set Delvien for marketing owner
<jacob> yup
<seisen> yep
<Delvien> does he respond?
<jacob> theidiotthatisme: sorry not marketing, education
<Delvien> I know he hasnt been on for a while
<jacob> Delvien: yeah, i talked to him a few days ago
<jacob> he uses my hosting service :D
<tnseditor> :-)
<theidiotthatisme> I forgot I was even on marketing, but I dont think I'm owner, I'm owner of Education ;)
<jacob> right, yeah :P
<jacob> that one
<jacob> actually hold on theidiotthatisme
<jacob> i said this wrong
<seisen> so he would need to set me up as education owner
<jacob> transfer education to seisen
* Delvien is downloading IBM symphony, new beta for IBMs word / ooo take
<jacob> not Delvien, he /is/ marketing
<seisen> jacob I think you partied too much new years, lol
<jacob> lol
<Delvien> I definitely did.... I called off work today to finish recovering
<jacob> we all started running down the driveway at new years eve banging pots and pans
<seisen> omg'
<jacob> mind you this is a 1/4 mile driveway and it was pitch black
<tnseditor> WOW
<jacob> singing "let's wake up the neighbors" from wkyk
<tnseditor> :-p
<jacob> lol
<jacob> aaannnnnnnnnyyyyyyywwwwwwaaaaaaayyyyyyyyy...................
<jacob> Delvien: do you have a hosting account of your own?
<Delvien> no :x
<jacob> Delvien: no prob, i'll get ya set up

<Delvien> kk
<jacob> http://fosswire.com <- wordpress site
<jacob> </plug>
<jacob> tnseditor: i'll get you the keys to SSH on the webserver
<jacob> tnseditor: used drupal much?
<tnseditor> no
<tnseditor> but I can learn :-)
<jacob> it isn't too hard
<tnseditor> ok
<seisen> how much does it cost to host a blog anyway, I know wordpress is free but....
<jacob> i'll show you that too
<tnseditor> Jacobs going to be busy
<Delvien> hey theidiotthatisme you have 1 computer to share between the both of you yes?
<jacob> seisen: i can host a blog for you if you want
* jacob goes ssh crazy
<jacob> in fact if anyone in here wants to host a blog/small website, i can give you an account w/ ohio.ubuntu-us.org subdomain (or on another domain) for free
<seisen> nice
<jacob> you can have... 500 meg of space + 5gb of bandwidth/month
<jacob> just don't kill the server ;)
<tnseditor> :-p
* Delvien just bulletproofed his servers ssh
<Delvien> jacob me pls
<jacob> subdomains you can pick from: *.ohio.ubuntu-us.org *.codechunk.net *.evura.com etc
<Delvien> jacob or whatever you were wanting to give me
<Phoenix301_> that sounds neat, but i would probably kill my 500 megs of space like none other, especially with all my graphics stuff
<Delvien> jacob code chunk prz
<jacob> hehe
<Delvien> love the code chunk name
<jacob> hehe
<Delvien> How is Lotus Symphony different?
<Delvien> You're in charge! Lotus Symphony is based on the Open Document Format (ODF) standard-which means you're not locked into proprietary file formats, software licensing agreements and upgrades. Finally, free tools and freedom of choice!
<tnseditor> yay!!!
<Delvien> I like IBM just a little more everyday
<jacob> ack i'll post details on that hosting thing in the forum
<jacob> hehe
<Delvien> ok jacob, thanks
<jacob> well, maybe not, because then a billion people will sign up for it..
<jacob> i'll contact y'all about it
<Delvien> k , you have my addy, so
<Delvien> Ok,
