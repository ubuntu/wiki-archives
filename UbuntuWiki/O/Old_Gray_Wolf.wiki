=== About Me ===

The name Old_Gray_Wolf was derived from the name I used on the citizens band radio in the 70's and 80”s - - Gray Wolf. Before the Internet existed I used citizens band radio to chat with my neighbors. By the time I joined the Ubuntu forum I was old and had gray hair; thus, Old Gray Wolf. I was born in 1948.

I started a lifelong adventure with computers in 1973. I have experienced many operating systems over the years. I saw the introduction of DOS, OSX, Unix, and Linux among others. 

I was working at the NASA Johnson Space Center when the first shuttle was launched on 12 April 1981. Those were interesting times. I worked alongside of some people you have probably read about or seen in documentaries.

I am still involved with computers. I am an engineering manager. I use FOSS to keep abreast of advances in technology.  FOSS helps me understand what the young engineers are excited about. It also enables me to help them get their work done in an environment they are comfortable with. I actually had to convince other managers, that were younger than me, that having our own private wikis and bulletin boards could actually increase the communication, productivity, and job satisfaction of our programmers.
