A software bug is an error or fault in a computer program which makes it fail to work as it's supposed to. This could be as simple as failing to work at all, or as complicated as a subtly incorrect result. Nevertheless, we really want to eliminate software bugs, as they make programs less useful.<<BR>>

One of the many reasons that Ubuntu is a great operating system is because it's developed by the community. You, me, and hundreds of other people join efforts in making it better each day. Bug triage is an excellent way to start helping out. You get to learn a lot about Ubuntu, its available packages, its infrastructure, and you get a feel for the development pulse.<<BR>>

Ubuntu receives an incredibly large number of bug reports every day through  our BugTrackingSystem.  Each one of these needs to be read, assessed, and sorted before being fixed in a process called Bug Triage. This is where we could use your assistance with HelpingWithBugs.<<BR>>

However, you don't need to do all of those things to help! Recreating a bug and setting the status to Confirmed or looking for a duplicate is enough. 
If you are experiencing a bug and want to submit it, please see <nowiki>[[Bugs-ReportingBugs|Report a Bug]]</nowiki>.
