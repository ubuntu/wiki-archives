Nov 14 20:14:08 <tnseditor>	it's about Ubucon
Nov 14 20:14:25 <vorian>	here is what we need
Nov 14 20:14:39 <vorian>	1) Main contact
Nov 14 20:15:02 <vorian>	2) Speaker coordinator
Nov 14 20:15:12 <vorian>	3) Exhibit coordinator
Nov 14 20:15:19 <vorian>	4) PR person
Nov 14 20:15:32 <vorian>	5) Hardware coordinator
Nov 14 20:15:47 <vorian>	these people _must_ be reliable
Nov 14 20:16:49 <vorian>	hello
Nov 14 20:16:51 <jacob>	honestly, since i'm usually iffy on getting to events, i'm probably not one for those :P
Nov 14 20:16:58 <tnseditor>	:-p
Nov 14 20:17:05 <jacob>	however
Nov 14 20:17:32 <vorian>	eh?
Nov 14 20:17:41 <tnseditor>	our LUG (Lima LUG) is kinda reorganizing in early 2008... maybe someone there will have thoughs/ideas/be willing to help
Nov 14 20:18:00 <jacob>	if it is a position where it can easily be done thru email/phone, written on paper, and sent along (just in case I'm unavailable) then I might be up for something
Nov 14 20:18:36 <jacob>	i'm sure theidiotthatisme would want something to do too :D
Nov 14 20:18:54 <vorian>	good good
Nov 14 20:19:03 <vorian>	maybe a website is in order
Nov 14 20:19:19 <seisen>	well i'm more of a behind the scenes kinda of guy so.......
Nov 14 20:19:35 *	PTelly (n=pop@d149-67-240-217.col.wideopenwest.com) has joined #ohio-ubucon
Nov 14 20:19:43 <vorian>	hmmk
Nov 14 20:19:48 <theidiotthatisme>	back
Nov 14 20:20:02 <jacob>	vorian, whenever you do those CNAME things I mentioned a while ago for that, poke me and I'll fire up a site
Nov 14 20:20:14 <jacob>	and if you need more info on that poke me too :P
Nov 14 20:20:21 *	vorian forgets
Nov 14 20:20:23 <vorian>	:P
Nov 14 20:20:43 <jacob>	CNAME -> ubucon.ohio.ubuntu-us.org
Nov 14 20:20:49 <vorian>	ah
Nov 14 20:21:01 <jacob>	that's all the admin of the nameserver should need to know... hopefully
Nov 14 20:21:17 <jacob>	any domain will work as long as the CNAME is set
Nov 14 20:21:19 <vorian>	jacob: let's do it
Nov 14 20:21:23 <vorian>	django style
Nov 14 20:21:31 <theidiotthatisme>	Anyone miss me? :-D
Nov 14 20:21:37 <vorian>	nope
Nov 14 20:21:39 <seisen>	nope
Nov 14 20:21:39 <vorian>	:P
Nov 14 20:21:41 <jacob>	lol
Nov 14 20:21:51 <jacob>	problem: host is bad with python; it's possible to run django, but a bit slow
Nov 14 20:21:53 <tnseditor>	to make you feel better...
Nov 14 20:21:54 <theidiotthatisme>	Jacob: If you're +1 for the gaming booths, dont forget to actually add your +1 to the Wiki, and if we get enough support we'll move it to approved and begin working on it
Nov 14 20:21:54 <tnseditor>	a little
Nov 14 20:22:03 <jacob>	kk theidiotthatisme 
Nov 14 20:22:05 <vorian>	scratch django then
Nov 14 20:22:23 <vorian>	let's do a plastic themed drupal then
Nov 14 20:22:27 <jacob>	hehe
Nov 14 20:22:45 <jacob>	drupal... wordpress.. anything php-ish works
Nov 14 20:23:15 <jacob>	i'm hoping drupal 6 comes out within the next month to take advantage of that
Nov 14 20:23:19 <vorian>	wp may be better... i don't care really
Nov 14 20:23:23 <theidiotthatisme>	And they're off on the website! *gun crack*
Nov 14 20:23:25 <theidiotthatisme>	lol
Nov 14 20:23:29 <jacob>	hehe
Nov 14 20:23:30 <tnseditor>	haha
Nov 14 20:23:34 <jacob>	anything really works
Nov 14 20:23:56 <vorian>	VB
Nov 14 20:23:57 <jacob>	WP actually might do well, especially if it is a news-oriented site
Nov 14 20:24:08 <vorian>	yeah, let's do WP
Nov 14 20:24:13 <jacob>	heh, that would be fun running around to get a license for
Nov 14 20:24:20 <jacob>	ok, works for me :)
Nov 14 20:24:25 <vorian>	\o/
Nov 14 20:24:41 <theidiotthatisme>	Anyone have any suggestions for Venue?
Nov 14 20:24:53 <vorian>	theidiotthatisme: let's wait to see what google has to offer
Nov 14 20:25:02 <seisen>	+1
Nov 14 20:25:10 <theidiotthatisme>	vorian: Not a problem, if we here from them will you post on the mailling list?
Nov 14 20:25:13 <theidiotthatisme>	*mailing
Nov 14 20:25:18 <vorian>	let's just say "somewhere in a deep underground bunker"
Nov 14 20:25:29 <theidiotthatisme>	That just sounds like an orgy >.<
Nov 14 20:25:31 <vorian>	absolutely
Nov 14 20:25:33 <theidiotthatisme>	Sorry
Nov 14 20:25:36 <theidiotthatisme>	Anyways
Nov 14 20:25:36 <seisen>	lol
Nov 14 20:25:51 <tnseditor>	maybe it's for a secret underground movement
Nov 14 20:25:52 <tnseditor>	:-p
Nov 14 20:25:59 <vorian>	so, for the event itself
Nov 14 20:26:14 <vorian>	do we want to be doing installs from start to finish?
Nov 14 20:26:22 <tnseditor>	that would be nice
Nov 14 20:26:26 *	vorian thinks it's prolly a good idea
Nov 14 20:26:29 <vorian>	ok
Nov 14 20:26:30 <seisen>	sure
Nov 14 20:26:31 <o0splitpaw01>	nod
Nov 14 20:26:35 <vorian>	so we need an install team
Nov 14 20:26:38 <theidiotthatisme>	Just have a section dedicated to it? Like an install team
Nov 14 20:26:39 <jacob>	yup
Nov 14 20:26:41 <tnseditor>	that way people have help if they have a problem
Nov 14 20:26:44 <tnseditor>	yes
Nov 14 20:27:03 <tnseditor>	and maybe show people how they can dual boot
Nov 14 20:27:13 <Phoenix301>	and then have some way that they can get help if something goes wrong at home...ie direct them to forums or something
Nov 14 20:27:15 <vorian>	bah, dual boot
Nov 14 20:27:26 <vorian>	the forums are terrible
Nov 14 20:27:28 <tnseditor>	well...
Nov 14 20:27:29 *	vorian hides
Nov 14 20:27:29 <o0splitpaw01>	advanced class to do a network install? I might have a machiene act like a server
Nov 14 20:27:45 <theidiotthatisme>	seisen: If you're interested in being part of the install team, you should Wiki it
Nov 14 20:27:46 <theidiotthatisme>	;)
Nov 14 20:27:53 <jacob>	have everyone building cat-5 crossover cables :P
Nov 14 20:27:57 <seisen>	aye aye captain
Nov 14 20:28:05 <theidiotthatisme>	Yes I'm pushing for everyone to add their stuff in the Wiki, talking about it without committing or suggesting just leaves me to a lot of Wiki editing O:-)
Nov 14 20:28:07 <tnseditor>	that way they will have confidence that if they end up not liking Ubuntu they can feel safe (haha) having Windows there too
Nov 14 20:28:38 <seisen>	should we let them try it out first before we even do the install
Nov 14 20:28:45 <Phoenix301>	live CD 
Nov 14 20:28:47 <o0splitpaw01>	I've seen an article from another Ubuntu team on how to make a network install image and how to deploy it on ubuntu server on linuxtoday
Nov 14 20:28:51 <tnseditor>	if the windows partition is kept in tact then they will have their files already on the computer
Nov 14 20:28:56 <jacob>	just added my comments to the wiki, but the formatter destroyed it hehe
Nov 14 20:29:02 <theidiotthatisme>	seisen: We should have some demos running Ubuntu around for them to try before putting on their computer
Nov 14 20:29:17 <vorian>	we were talking about that earlier
Nov 14 20:29:27 <theidiotthatisme>	I'm not particular on using the LiveCD to demo for them, it's slow for first impressions
Nov 14 20:29:28 <seisen>	that way if they don't like we are not wasting time 
Nov 14 20:29:35 <vorian>	brb
Nov 14 20:29:39 <vorian>	*restarts*
Nov 14 20:29:41 <theidiotthatisme>	vorian: okee
Nov 14 20:29:42 <jacob>	definitely install a new system
Nov 14 20:29:44 <seisen>	live cd crawls
Nov 14 20:29:57 *	vorian has quit ("Ex-Chat")
Nov 14 20:30:00 <jacob>	maybe just a new user profile even if people don't mind bringing in laptops
Nov 14 20:30:33 <tnseditor>	yes
Nov 14 20:30:37 <o0splitpaw01>	If we don't have internet, we could use the ubuntu server also as a repository too. (Have to read up on that)
Nov 14 20:30:47 <jacob>	^ like that idea
Nov 14 20:30:54 <theidiotthatisme>	o0splitpaw01: Good idea
Nov 14 20:31:04 <jacob>	couple GB of data, but I like it
Nov 14 20:31:09 <seisen>	add it to the wiki
Nov 14 20:31:20 <jacob>	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/OhioTeam/OhioUbucon08
Nov 14 20:31:33 <jacob>	actually, so i don't have to keep pasting it
Nov 14 20:31:34 <o0splitpaw01>	ok. I'll hunt for info on that
Nov 14 20:31:38 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to jacob
Nov 14 20:31:40 *	jacob has changed the topic to: Ohio Ubucon! | https://wiki.ubuntu.com/OhioTeam/OhioUbucon08
Nov 14 20:31:41 *	ChanServ removes channel operator status from jacob
Nov 14 20:31:50 <jacob>	theeeerrreee we go
Nov 14 20:31:56 <tnseditor>	June 15th... we may have Bible School then
Nov 14 20:31:57 <theidiotthatisme>	Props for jacob
Nov 14 20:31:59 <tnseditor>	but other than that.
Nov 14 20:32:10 <jacob>	what about june 15th?
Nov 14 20:32:23 <tnseditor>	that's when it says the date it for Ubucon
Nov 14 20:32:26 <theidiotthatisme>	jacob: the 15th is the 3rd Saturday
Nov 14 20:32:30 <jacob>	ah
Nov 14 20:32:30 <tnseditor>	oh
Nov 14 20:32:34 <tnseditor>	then...
Nov 14 20:32:38 <theidiotthatisme>	It's the date Vorian had been talking about with Google
Nov 14 20:32:38 <seisen>	its not set in stone yet
Nov 14 20:32:50 <theidiotthatisme>	Yeah, there's time for change
Nov 14 20:32:57 <jacob>	had vorian mailed google about it yet? didn't think he did
Nov 14 20:32:58 <tnseditor>	Bible School would probably be the next week.
Nov 14 20:33:03 <theidiotthatisme>	But if Google decides to sponsor on that day, especially for a place to host it, it may be
Nov 14 20:33:15 <theidiotthatisme>	jacob: Yes, vorian has already contacted Google
Nov 14 20:33:21 <jacob>	there's always the threat of vacation (hehe) but I'm probably free
Nov 14 20:33:27 <theidiotthatisme>	but a while ago, and I think he is doing so again
Nov 14 20:33:38 <theidiotthatisme>	That would be my vacation lol
Nov 14 20:34:17 <tnseditor>	so, is there a Google office in Columbus?
Nov 14 20:34:29 <jacob>	didn't think so.... but....
Nov 14 20:34:32 *	jacob googles google
Nov 14 20:34:34 <PTelly>	when I last checked with our Parish Admin we could have Ubucon @ the church. I can check again but it might be best to have a range of dates. We do have wireless
Nov 14 20:34:35 <theidiotthatisme>	good questjion, never dealt with Google before
Nov 14 20:34:35 <tnseditor>	haha
Nov 14 20:34:39 <jacob>	*internet exploded*
Nov 14 20:34:40 <o0splitpaw01>	They did open a location there
Nov 14 20:34:42 <jacob>	oops my bad
Nov 14 20:34:53 <theidiotthatisme>	PTelly: Good idea :-)
Nov 14 20:35:18 <tnseditor>	Jacob: what browser were you using?... because if you are using Firefox, the internet shouldn't explode :-p
Nov 14 20:35:23 <theidiotthatisme>	Right now it's a good idea to just get a list of possible locations, and decide on the best one
Nov 14 20:35:30 <jacob>	google made the internet explode
Nov 14 20:35:31 <theidiotthatisme>	tnseditor: Nope, then it implodes
Nov 14 20:35:33 <theidiotthatisme>	:-D
Nov 14 20:35:33 <jacob>	i broke the internets
Nov 14 20:35:46 <jacob>	INFINITE LOOP! o noes
Nov 14 20:35:47 <tnseditor>	:-p
Nov 14 20:35:49 <o0splitpaw01>	your internets belong to me.
Nov 14 20:35:54 <seisen>	tht sucks
Nov 14 20:35:56 <jacob>	anyway.... </offtopic>
Nov 14 20:36:06 <tnseditor>	I thought the internet only exploded with Internet Exploder :-p
Nov 14 20:36:13 <jacob>	:P
Nov 14 20:36:28 <PTelly>	church is located in Gahanna near Hamilton and I 270
Nov 14 20:36:40 <tnseditor>	ooo
Nov 14 20:36:47 <tnseditor>	I have friends in Hamilton
Nov 14 20:37:13 <Phoenix301>	tnseditor: how far is that from here?
Nov 14 20:37:21 <PTelly>	Opps, Hamilton Rd and I 270
Nov 14 20:37:21 <tnseditor>	by Cincinatti
Nov 14 20:37:28 <tnseditor>	nevermind

Nov 14 20:37:43 <Phoenix301>	lol 
Nov 14 20:38:04 <tnseditor>	if it was in Hamilton Ohio we could see Jenna and Sarah and go to Kings Island :-p
Nov 14 20:38:17 <jacob>	hamilton road... that sounds familiar
Nov 14 20:38:24 <jacob>	nvm there's a hamilton rd in delaware :P
Nov 14 20:38:43 <Phoenix301>	i was going to say, chances are there is more than one hamilton road
Nov 14 20:38:49 <PTelly>	in Columbus
Nov 14 20:38:51 <Phoenix301>	any other location ideas?
Nov 14 20:38:52 <jacob>	heh
Nov 14 20:39:12 <tnseditor>	brb
Nov 14 20:39:22 <jacob>	the Columbus convention center would be realllllly nice... though Google would have to cover for that hehe

Nov 14 20:39:36 <theidiotthatisme>	lol
Nov 14 20:39:38 <jacob>	hehe
Nov 14 20:39:39 <jacob>	true
Nov 14 20:39:51 <o0splitpaw01>	Well, Google offices in Columbus? they may have a conference room? (Too far of a stretch?)
Nov 14 20:39:51 <jacob>	let's get the SABDFL to come
Nov 14 20:40:09 <theidiotthatisme>	jacob: You gonna do that? lol
Nov 14 20:40:22 <theidiotthatisme>	o0splitpaw01: I believe another LoCo did  that (NYC?) so that's a possibility
Nov 14 20:40:36 <jacob>	we prodded him about it a couple months ago during a CC meeting (though that might've been for OLF)
Nov 14 20:40:52 <theidiotthatisme>	That was for OLF
Nov 14 20:40:58 <jacob>	thought so
Nov 14 20:41:24 <jacob>	someone sign up for ubuntu membership, quick, so we can have an excuse to bug him again
Nov 14 20:41:47 <theidiotthatisme>	Dont we already have at least two people with membership? lol
Nov 14 20:42:05 <theidiotthatisme>	Well I'm sorry to head off early, but I have to get dinner going. Sorry I couldn't stay long tonight :-(
