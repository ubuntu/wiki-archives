__TOC__

== Scope ==
The purpose of this group buy is so that members of the OK and LA team can purchase some items in bulk from the Canonical Store and avoid the seemingly outrageous shipping costs due to shipping overseas. If you have any suggestions or questions feel free to find me my contact info is at my wiki page TreyBrown .

=== Who and What ===

Here is a table for people to add their name, email, and what they want to order so that costs can be calculated.

=== Payment and Final Shipping ===

Once I gage interest and get more of a feel about what will be involved I will see what will be involved on getting me the money and the shipping costs of the items from me to you. I also think that the shipping from Canonical to me should be split evenly not based on each person's order size, but am open to suggestions.
