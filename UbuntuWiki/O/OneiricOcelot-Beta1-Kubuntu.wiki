Kubuntu will release version 11.10, the Oneiric Ocelot, in October 2011. With this beta pre-release, we have been working on bug fixing and polishing things in in preparation for our next official version. Read below for some of the highlights. For more information of what is planned and being worked on, please read the <nowiki>[[http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-oneiric/group/topic-oneiric-kubuntu.html|Oneiric Ocelot status page]]</nowiki>.

'''NOTE:''' This is an beta pre-release. Pre-release versions of Kubuntu are NOT encouraged for anyone needing a stable system or for anyone who is not comfortable running into occasional, even frequent, breakage. Pre-release versions ARE recommended for Kubuntu developers and those who want to help in testing, reporting, and fixing bugs. Please do not use this in a production environment with data or workflows that you cannot do without.

Beta releases can be downloaded from the following URLs: 
* CDs for standard PCs/laptops/netbooks - http://releases.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/oneiric/
* DVDs and Mac optimized CDs - http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/releases/oneiric/beta-1/

It is always best to <nowiki>[[https://wiki.kubuntu.org/HowToMD5SUM|check your CD image]]</nowiki> before you install! The MD5 checksums can be found <nowiki>[[http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/releases/oneiric/beta-1/MD5SUMS|alongside the CD images]]</nowiki>.

Instructions for upgrading are available <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OneiricUpgrades|here]]</nowiki>.

== Beta 1 Highlights ==
                                                                                                                                                                                    
=== Plasma and KDE Applications 4.7 ===

<nowiki>[[attachment:desktop.png | <nowiki>[[File:desktop-wee.png]]</nowiki></nowiki>]]

<nowiki>[[http://kde.org/announcements/4.7/|The latest stable release of KDE's Plasma Workspaces and Applications]]</nowiki> brings new features and improvements all around. Highlights include:

* Visual updates include a new Oxygen icon theme
* A cleaner default look to Dolphin
* Gwenview's new ability to compare two or more images
* New breadcrumb feature in the Kickoff menu that simplifies navigating submenus
* More improvements in the Network Management widget
 
More details can be found <nowiki>[[http://kde.org/announcements/4.7/plasma.php|here]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[http://kde.org/announcements/4.7/applications.php|here]]</nowiki>.

=== KDEPIM 4.7 ===

<nowiki>[[attachment:kontact.png | <nowiki>[[File:kontact-wee.png]]</nowiki></nowiki>]]

Along with KDE 4.7, 11.10 also introduces the new KDEPIM suite, which includes the new Kmail 2. The look and feel is familiar, but under the hood, most of the PIM suite is now fully migrated to the <nowiki>[[http://userbase.kde.org/Glossary#Akonadi|Akonadi]]</nowiki> storage service.

'''IMPORTANT''': Do note that this is a major upgrade to the mail, calendar and addressbook systems, and as such still needs usage and migration testing. While loss of data should not be an issue, it is '''''highly recommended''''' to ''back up all important data, mail, contact information, and calendars if you plan to test upgrading to 11.10''. 

=== Amarok 2.4.3 ===

<nowiki>[[attachment:amarok243.png | <nowiki>[[File:amarok243.png||width=400]]</nowiki></nowiki>]]

This new and improved version of the default music player features native support for remote NFS & SMB/CIFS collections, a better looking user interface, support for gpodder.net, as well as vastly improved reliability.

For more information have a look at the release announcements of Amarok <nowiki>[[http://amarok.kde.org/en/releases/2.4.1|2.4.1]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[http://amarok.kde.org/en/releases/2.4.3|2.4.3]]</nowiki>

=== Muon Suite ===

<nowiki>[[attachment:msc.png | <nowiki>[[File:msc-wee.png]]</nowiki></nowiki>]]

Accessing thousands of free applications for your computer has never been easier. The Muon Software Center provides an easy-to-use way to access extra applications, games and accessories to further customize your desktop. Applications come with ratings and reviews for each application from the wider Ubuntu community, as well as with screenshot previews to help you make informed decisions.

<nowiki>[[attachment:mpm.png | <nowiki>[[File:mpm-wee.png]]</nowiki></nowiki>]]

For the budding system administrator, the Muon Package Manager provides a powerful feature set with a usability-driven interface. With its lightning-fast quick-search and extensive filtering abilities, you should have no trouble finding exactly the right package. From selective upgrades to package pinning to mass package removal, the Muon Package Manager should give you every tool you need to quickly and efficiently administer your system.

=== KWin OpenGL ES ===

The new package kde-window-manager-gles allows testing of the Plasma Workspace's window manager using <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_ES|OpenGL ES]]</nowiki> instead of regular OpenGL. This new technology is particular interesting in the not so distant future for mobile devices. For more information read up on <nowiki>[[http://blog.martin-graesslin.com/blog/2011/07/running-kwin-with-opengl-es-2-0/|Martin Gräßlin's blog]]</nowiki>.

== Known Problems ==
* Bug:838325 kubuntu-full doesn't install complete system - If installing from the Kubuntu DVD, a fully functional system isn't installed. To work around this for Oneiric Beta 1, use the text mode installer and select both the kubuntu-desktop and kubuntu-full tasks. 
* Bug:805906 Shutdown in the live session under VirtualBox sometimes does not work and seems to just hang on the desktop. Just restart the computer with the power button in that case, there is no possibility of data loss.
* <nowiki>[[https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=275469|KDE Bug 275469]]</nowiki> A window may retain a taskbar entry after closing the application.
