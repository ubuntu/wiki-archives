=== Opensessame's scope of use. Features and ideas ===
The OpenSessame system will try to answer two use-case senarios. The first is time tracking of an employee by clocking entry and exit events through check points (or gates). Employee work time management will be optionally linked to an external payroll system. The second use-case is entry access control and security function. Initially, this will be accomplished via touch button ID readers and possibly other mechanisms. All functionality will be coded in python and supported by PostgreSQL.
