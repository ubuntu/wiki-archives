~+Papercuts are fast to fix, but annoying bugs. Our mission is to make Ubuntu shine by reducing them.+~

===  ===

==== WHAT WE WANT TO GET ====

* The Ubuntu experience to be a pleasure.

* Give Ubuntu a playful feel.
* Getting involved in Ubuntu development to be accessible for children.

==== IN WHICH MOMENTS WE APPROACH MORE THAN USUAL TO WHAT WE WANT ====

* When we have clear why we are here.
* When we focus in work rather than in planning.
* When we hold communication to minimum.
* When we write documentation in wiki to be simple over complete.
* When it is discussed before.
* When processes are under a well planning.

==== WHAT WE DO DIFFERENT UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES ====

* We all focus in what we feel it's really important for all.
* Instead of working hard, we create an ecosystem that works itself.
* We quickly identify problems landing on the scope of the project.
* We focus in getting work done.
* We focus in things to be simple.
* We complete our points of view with other's.
* We forward actions to the right people.
* We ask ourselves how much value the work been done is inducing.

==== WHAT WE THINK THAT MAKES US TO ACT THIS WAY ====

* That our work is valuable to many people.
* That we can experience the result on real life.
* That work is what makes real feedback with reality.
* That simplicity is what really makes you know you're doing right.
* That all of us together are the greatest potential.
* That working just in the most important thing is what makes commits easy.
* That what we want is the true reference.

==== WHAT ELSE THINKS WHO IS SUCCESSFUL HERE ====

* That people who created everything around you is not smarter than you.
* That doing the kind of things that works, it does for everyone.
* That trusting in the above is what is important.
* That doing better is not about working harder, but to be able to get it right by working less.
* That only the 20% of work that gets the 80% of worth is the really important one.
* That you'll never get tired of working in something that makes sense to you.
* That working in what you feel is of value is what will make you to distinguish, although you don't know why in the beginning.
* That uncertainty is natural when taking targets never done before, and assuming it is the difference between who dreams about it and actually gets it.
* That leadership is just taking work others are scared off.
* That he isn't what he thinks or does: it just does it because he wants it.
* That is natural that people rather believe in their points of view, because are these of what they will have always a better level of detail of.
* That with simplicity comes beauty, and beauty reflects potential.
* That everyone knows what knows, and doesn't know what doesn't know.
* That all together know much more than a genius itself.
* That trust is the greatest interpersonal prize, and transparency is what creates it.

You don't need to take care of action,
rather to take care of what you wish.

Because a river cannot stay quiet having a cascade,
and you always get grass with a river ahead.
