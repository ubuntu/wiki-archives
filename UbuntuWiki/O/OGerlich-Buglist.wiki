=== Bug List ===

This is an "unofficial" bug list for my own notekeeping. Feel free to add your own notes to an entry, but please add your (nick) name and distinguish your additions somehow (for example in ''italics'') - thanks!

* Intrepid + gnome-terminal + vino + krdc + murrine-theme (on minibox): when right-clicking into gnome-terminal while using krdc client and vino VNC server, the first context menu item is automatically selected. Doesn't happen when using mouse directly (ie. without VNC).
** does it happen with other VNC clients/servers as well?
** what about other themes?
** is this already reported? Haven't found anything so far
** apparently a "problem" with VNC servers: on right-click-down, the server (vino at least) simulates a MotionNotify and ButtonDown event, on right-click-release it simulates a MotionNotify and ButtonUp event (seen in xev)... With native mouse, only ButtonDown and ButtonUp are generated. The MotionNotify event probably prevents some "quirk" (or bug?) in GTK context menu code which detects when a button was pressed and released without moving and which then suppresses the "activate" event.
** for vino, the MotionNotify and ButtonDown code was there from the beginning (the XTestFakeMotionEvent() and XTestFakeButtonEvent() calls in vino_input_handle_pointer_event())
** for x11vnc, the pointer() function (in pointer.c) apparently first calls update_x11_pointer_position() and then update_x11_pointer_mask() for every pointer event; the former function calls XTestFakeMotionEvent_wr() while the latter one calls do_button_mask_change() which calls XTestFakeButtonEvent_wr() - same result as for vino
** as the header of vino-input.c states, several projects (vino, x11vnc, libvncserver, krfb, x0rfbserver) all share parts of code, so maybe the behavior was just copied from a single simple implementation... Might be interesting to test some independent VNC server (Xvnc?)
** Xvnc (with vncviewer as client) seems to work correctly... xev says that a button-press-and-release does not generate a MotionNotify; and the context menu in gnome-terminal behaves correctly as well; when running x11vnc in the Xvnc and connecting to it, the problem is visible (as expected).
** reported as bgo 564520 (http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=564520)

* Intrepid + gedit + vino + krdc (on minibox): it looks like gtksourceview syntax highlighting uses extremely high CPU load over vino/krdc. When loading a C file, the machine is very slow until the whole file has been highlighted

* Gutsy (on peterchen): totem-xine has no deinterlacing
** test with Hardy or Intrepid (put Live System on USB stick and boot from it)
** also test with totem-gstreamer
** generally check whether totem-gstreamer is now usable for DVDs
*** no (Intrepid: still no DVD menu support)

* Gutsy (on peterchen): certain UDF DVD is not recognized correctly (works fine when mounting as iso9660; works fine on MacOSX and probably also on Windows)
** Update: this is a known problem (see https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/util-linux/+bug/10550), caused by missing Execute bit on directories in UDF file system
** add "ls -l" output to this page
** result with Intrepid from USB drive:
<pre>
~$ ls -la /media/cdrom/
ls: Zugriff auf /media/cdrom/. nicht möglich: Permission denied
ls: Zugriff auf /media/cdrom/.. nicht möglich: Permission denied

d????????? ? ? ? ?                ? ..
?????????? ? ? ? ?                ? VIDEO_TS
</pre>
** document currently-used workaround (from /etc/fstab) on this page
** check with Hardy or Intrepid (boot Live System from USB stick)
** no success with Intrepid (mounts disc as UDF and then fails to display content - see above)
** maybe check how Vista sees this

* Intrepid + Cheese (on minibox): Trust WB-??? webcam doesn't work well (it is recognized only after a while, there are warnings on terminal, and cheese uses whole CPU even though framerate is at ~2Hz; also, image is very dark and apparently can't be brightened in Cheese)
** check whether high CPU load happens with other webcams as well
** add details about webcam and used driver to this page

* Intrepid (also Gutsy and Hardy and probably older releases): PXE boot on EeePc not working OOTB, as atl2 driver is missing from initrd
** what are the rules for adding new drivers to official LiveCD initrd?

* default Ubuntu installation uses lots of disk space, which is esp. bad on netbook with small disk; interesting points to look at:
** i18n (.mo) files: compression should help a lot (maybe put files onto compressed file system?)
** SVG icons: compress (is .svgz generally supported nowadays?)
** help files: remove help files for other languages, and compress the remaining HTML files

* Intrepid LiveCD: when stracing Firefox to find out about its wakeups, this strange thing turned up:
<pre>
16:20:13.226781 inotify_add_watch(55, "/usr/share/gdm/applications", IN_MODIFY|IN_ATTRIB|IN_MOVED_FROM|IN_MOVED_TO|IN_CREATE|IN_DELETE|IN_DELETE_SELF|IN_MOVE_SELF|IN_UNMOUNT|IN_ONLYDIR) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)

16:20:13.227065 inotify_add_watch(55, "/home/ubuntu/.local/share/applications", IN_MODIFY|IN_ATTRIB|IN_MOVED_FROM|IN_MOVED_TO|IN_CREATE|IN_DELETE|IN_DELETE_SELF|IN_MOVE_SELF|IN_UNMOUNT|IN_ONLYDIR) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
</pre>
   Apparently FF tries to add a watch on these (nonexistent) directories every few seconds. Seems somewhat unnecessary.

* Gutsy (probably later version as well): password dialogs usually don't show whether CapsLock is pressed; for example:
** keyring unlock dialog (this one is important as the user has to enter PW at every boot)
** gksu dialog (not so important but might be nice anyway)
** problem can be mitigated by disabling CapsLock at all; however, so far there is no direct setting for this (it's only possible to turn CapsLock into another Ctrl key)

* Lenny + Rhythmbox: Internet radio is not very robust against short system "freezes" - eg. when starting a 3D game, Rhythmbox sometimes stops playing and doesn't resume it anymore

* wishlist: really global keyboard shortcuts which also work in fullscreen games (like for volume control)

* Intrepid (on minibox): aptitude now always wants to remove the -dev packages (and some others, like cdbs) which were installed by "apt-get build-dep vino"... pressing the ":" for those packages changes the A flag, which is not satisfying either. Which means I can't really use aptitude now without having to take care of these other packages

* Hardy (on eeepc): Gedit crashes when activating AdvancedBookmarks Plugin which is installed in /usr/lib/gedit-2/
** the plugin expects that ~/.gnome2/gedit/plugins/ exists
** maybe Gedit always crashes if a plugin raises an exception during activation?
** verified: it crashes if the plugin class raises an exception in its <code>__init__()</code> method
*** reported at http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=573179

* Lenny + Konqueror 3.5.9 + gnome-system-monitor 2.22: gsm takes very much CPU time as soon as the Processes tab is selected
** apparently this is caused in libwnck, by wnck_pid_read_resource_usage_fill_cache() and wnck_find_pid_for_resource_r()
** these functions are called by a Idle callback to create a mapping between window IDs and PIDs
** for every top level window (as reported by XResQueryClients()) they traverse the whole (?) window tree and look at all windows that match the resource mask and return for the last matching window the _NET_WM_PID property
** the tree traversal (with XQueryTree()) is very expensive (there's a bugreport for this problem on fdo bugtracker for xrestop)
** however, biggest problem: on my KDE desktop there are really many windows reported; "xwininfo -root -tree | wc -l" gives something around 24000 windows, while the same command on a nearly-unused Intrepid/Gnome desktop gives 390 windows...
*** of the 24k wins on my desktop, around 8000 are children of the root window, with a line like "0xa011cd8 (has no name): ()  840x420+420+315  +420+315", no name, "Map State: IsUnMapped"...
*** some of these are legitimate windows created by Konqueror for all its menus
*** finally, this might be a window leak in Konqueror: when right-clicking in a Konqueror window, there are three new top-level windows created and not destroyed; I'm not sure whether these windows will ever be destroyed (maybe they are sort-of "cached" and are no leak)
*** see below for this problem

* Lenny + Konqueror 3.5.9: Konqueror seems to leak three windows when opening context menu
** this is also reproducible on another KDE 3.5 machine
** looks like the leaked windows are created through KXMLGUI, for "Open with", Preview, and Actions submenus; here's an exemplary backtrace:

** for context menu, 15 windows are created (with 15 XCreateSimpleWindow calls); after menu is closed, 12 of the window IDs do not exist anymore while the 3 from KXMLGUIBuilder still exist
** reported at https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=181784

* Lenny: Gedit doesn't recognize ltrace.c (from ltrace 0.5-3.1 source package for Lenny) as C file (it says text/plain instead of text/x-csrc); as result, one has to manually switch to C highlighting

* Hardy + Firefox 3 (on eeepc): on Suspend-to-Disk, FF3 might hold lots of memory for caches which prevents STD because the 512MB swap disk is too small
** on about:cache page under "Memory cache device" it can be seen how much storage is "inactive"
** workaround: open about:config, search for "memory", and set browser.cache.memory.enable to false and then back to true; the "Inactive storage" value should be down to 0kb then, and STD usually works then
** other workaround: close FF3 and save its session, and rely that it reopens all tabs on next start
** it would be nice to have some command-line tool to request FF3 to release all caches; the tool could then be run automatically before STD

* GTK file chooser (and probably Nautilus as well) should support case-insensitive sorting (or "natural sorting")
** in Konqueror there is a View -> Case Insensitive Sort menuitem for this
** in GTK, there could be a gconf option or an option in ~/.config/gtk-2.0/gtkfilechooser to switch behavior
** this could also include intelligent sorting of file names with numbers (AFAIK Windows Explorer and Thunar already have this)

* Gutsy: after installing timer-applet in aptitude, the applet does not appear in list when choosing Panel -> Rightclick -> Add To Panel
** maybe re-login or reboot would help; but it should also work right away
** is there a way to make a manual refresh of applet list?
** running "killall gnome-panel" works as workaround

* Gutsy: copying an Audio CD seems to be really difficult... Using Rightclick -> Copy CD/DVD creates a .iso and a .iso.toc file; but seems no applications knows how to burn this?
** only possible way seems to be to use sound-juicer to extract to FLAC files and then burn these files with serpentine; with several drawbacks I suppose:
** gaps between tracks might be different from original
** using FLAC probably requires more CPU power, which is useless here because the intermediate files will be deleted  afterwards anyway
** update: Brasero can open the .iso.toc file, but one problem when trying to burn the .iso.toc file is that the .iso and the .iso.toc files must not be renamed nor moved afterwards, because the .iso.toc file contains the full path to .iso file...
** also, Brasero also searches for a .iso.bin file... Making a symlink for that seems to help there

* Hardy + GVFS + FTP + Gedit (on charly): when opening a file on GVFS FTP share in Gedit, the file is opened read-only in Gedit even though it is actually writable.
** as result, the "Save" button is disabled
** using "Save As" to store the file over the original file works after showing this message: "The file "ftp://example.com/testdir/testfile.txt" is read-only. Do you want to try to replace it with the one you are saving?" (select "Replace" there). Looks like this message always appears when trying to overwrite a file on FTP server.
** with SFTP the file is opened correctly with read-write access, and saving works fine (OTOH, Gedit doesn't seem to reliably detect if the file is _not_ writable and then pops up an error message while saving)
** -> check if it still happens on Jaunty

* Hardy + GVFS + SSH (on charly): GVFS gets user and group IDs from remote host but uses local /etc/passwd for resolving user and group names... Common IDs like 1000 and 1001 are then easily resolved to wrong names
** this is probably a difficult problem (essentially it needs to somehow map remote and local user IDs...)
** a bug report probably already exists on LP or BGO -> need to find it

* Hardy + GVFS + SSH (on charly): the SFTP connection had disappeared when I looked after some hours of not using the system... The FTP connection was still there, though
** is this some regular timeout? Maybe in SSH server or client config?
** anyway, it shouldn't happen in a normal system
** -> test whether this happens regularly
** how to debug this? Where does gvfsd-sftp leave its log messages (is this configurable)?

* Hardy + Evince: for http://www.punktgenau.de/Punktgenau.pdf , the "Settings" dialog displays an empty Fonts list
** if there are really no fonts, then display something like "<i>(no fonts embedded)</i>"
** or should the list for this file not be empty at all (ie. bug in PDF reader)?
** -> check with other readers
** -> check on Jaunty
** -> if still persists, make Usability bugreport on BGO

* Hardy (on peterchen): Toshiba laptop doesn't detect lid closing event after lid was closed (and machine suspended) for first time
** after reboot, works again for one shot
** acpi_listen doesn't show any event for those non-working cases (don't know about the first, working case)
** screen goes dark every time id is closed, though (is this done by laptop hardware?); so the switch itself works
** /proc/acpi/button/lid/LID/state shows "open" in non-working cases
** g-p-m verbose log doesn't show anything for non-working cases

* Jaunty beta + GVFS (on jaunty-alpha-usb on eeepc): looks like WebDAV access to mediacenter.gmx.net is (again) broken
** according to Wireshark, gvfs sends an HTTP/1.1 "OPTIONS" request first (without any password) which is anwered by a HTTP/1.0 Authorization Required response; and then nothing more
** request:
<pre>
OPTIONS / HTTP/1.1
Host: mediacenter.gmx.net
User-Agent: gvfs/1.2.1
</pre>

** response:
<pre>
HTTP/1.0 401 Unauthorized
Date: Wed Apr  8 11:49:59 2009
Server: GMX-DAV-Proxy
Content-Length: 7554
WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="GMX MediaCenter"

(followed by HTML source for a login page or the like)
</pre>
** maybe gvfs tries to get some initial info from the server and expects to not need a password for this?
** looks like it works correctly when mounting a dav:// URI without username (like "gvfs-mount dav://mediacenter.gmx.net" - it asks for username interactively then), but fails when prepending a username (like "gvfs-mount dav://someuser@mediacenter.gmx.net"); maybe this was already broken from the beginning

* Jaunty beta + NM (on jaunty-alpha-usb on eeepc): if a Wifi connection is set as "system-wide", the Edit button for the connection has a key icon, but clicking this button has no effect
** probably it should open the PolicyKit password dialog for system pw, but it doesn't work...
** looks like this is caused by this (experimental) pam_fprint stuff in /etc/pam.d/common-auth:
<pre>
auth sufficient pam_fprint.so
</pre>
  While on console it only prints some message like "Could not locate any suitable fingerprints matched with available hardware.", PolicyKit seems to hang then.
** -> maybe file a PolicyKit bug; or wait until fprintd is correctly integrated in Ubuntu

* Jaunty beta + NM (on jaunty-alpha-usb on eeepc): in NM connection editor, when clicking on a "normal" (not system-wide) connection, it asks me whether nm-connection-editor may access my keyring (note: I have not unlocked the keyring already because it was not necessary); when selecting "Deny" instead of "OK", it will ask me up to three more times, instead of just accepting that I don't want to grant access

* Jaunty RC + Yelp (on jaunty-alpha-usb on eeepc): Yelp exits with assertion failure when clicking some link twice
** click on System -> Settings -> Keyboard, click Help button (or run "gnome-help ghelp:user-guide#goscustperiph-2")
** wait for Yelp to finish loading, click on "8.4.1.6 Settings for the Mouse Keys" in the TOC box -> CPU is busy, but nothing happens
** when CPU gets idle, click that link again -> Yelp exits
** .xsession-errors shows this error message:
<pre>
Yelp:ERROR:yelp-document.c:275:yelp_document_cancel_page: assertion failed: (document != NULL && YELP_IS_DOCUMENT (document))
</pre>
** already reported at https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/yelp/+bug/220142

* Jaunty RC + gnome-keyboard-properties (on jaunty-alpha-usb on eeepc): "mouse keys" feature doesn't work / doesn't tell how to use it
** when enabling the "control mouse pointer through keyboard" feature, there is no indication which keys actually control the pointer...
** ideally a short text or an image would explain how to control the mouse
** -> create usability bug report on LP/BGO
** -> also make sure that Help button explains this as well
** note: the mouse can be moved using the numeric key pad

* Jaunty (on jaunty-alpha-usb on peterchen): continuous ATKD ACPI event leads to high CPU load
** acpi_listen shows a continuous stream of this:
<pre>
hotkey ATKD 0000005f 0000a285n
</pre>
** as result, acpid and hal-addon-acpi are always generating several percent of CPU load, and sys CPU load is at 67% (for one core)
** I _think_ this also occurred with Intrepid USB system
** maybe caused by inappropriate modules loaded on this installation?
** -> check with LiveCD or full installation
** -> what is this hotkey?
** see http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=977296 for a similar (the same?) problem, also on Toshiba L40...
** workaround:
** disable the content of /etc/acpi/events/asus-wireless-2 and /etc/acpi/events/asus-wireless-on (prepend # chars for every line)
** run /etc/init.d/acpid reload
** CPU load goes to 0%, and acpi_listen is quiet
** maybe some feedback loop - maybe the ASUS wireless scripts enable/disable Wifi which triggers the ACPI events again?

=== Desktop (Jaunty) Problems ===
* Gnome keyboard hotkeys: Volume mute/up/down doesn't quite work
** they don't affect master but some other mixer, and sometimes don't affect volume at all...
** using the Mute hotkey does open a notification but doesn't change the mixer applet icon
** workaround: affected mixer must be manually specified - see https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/174292
* even after setting affected mixer manually, the mixer applet icon is not updated if the ALSA mixer is changed by other apps (like alsamixer or gnome volume control dialog)
* Gnome volume control dialog: muting and then unmuting PCM channel keeps the channel muted
** alsamixer shows that the PCM channel does not support muting here, so apparently the Gnome mixer resorts to setting actual PCM volume to 0
** I think this is wrong (exactly because it's non-reversible)
** at the very least, it should update the slider position
* GVFS + SFTP: Nautilus hangs for a while (some minutes even?) when opening Properties window of a "socket file" on an SSH share
** the dialog is finally displayed, but Nautilus is unresponsive until then
* Nautilus: Properties dialog for files on my normal disk show "Medium: unknown" instead of something like "root partition" or whatever is shown in Nautilus -> Computer
* Gedit: doesn't show final new line in a file
* Nautilus: Properties dialog doesn't show exact size (in bytes) if multiple files are selected
* Evince: when opening incomplete PDF files, it fills .xsession-errors with "Illegal character <69> in hex string" error messages until the file is ended with "...Too much output, ignoring rest..."
** this makes it impossible to see messages from other programs, until logout
* Firefox: the sessionstore.js file is all one line which makes it really difficult to look at it
** less: can't really search in the file (always says "Pattern not found")
** nano: is very slow when scrolling through the line
** Gedit: didn't try, but it's known to not cope with "extreme" files
** what other tool would be possible?
