    Will you be able to commit to hold Ubucon at the Ohio LinuxFest this year?
    Does team Ohio need our help in reaching out to other state locos for help?
    Do you argee to hold some desktop basic content? If needed, we can provide the speakers for this component.

    Are you comfortable to allow the Ohio LinuxFest to do publicity stating that Ubucon will return and include desktop basic content as part of schedule?
