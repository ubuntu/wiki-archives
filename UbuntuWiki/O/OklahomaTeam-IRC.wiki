Want to talk with members of the Oklahoma LoCo Team right now? '''Join the IRC channel #ubuntu-us-ok on FreeNode.''' 

'''Dont have an IRC Client?  <nowiki>[[http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=ubuntu-us-ok|try this]]</nowiki>.'''

== IRC Guidelines ==

Please review and be familiar with the following information, this is what the operators and the members of the OK LoCo should abide by in IRC

=== Preamble ===

Keeping a pleasant atmosphere in #ubuntu-us-ok has been the main cause for it to be such an attractive place to both new and experienced users in the state of Oklahoma. The users of the channel should do their best to keep the channel friendly so that we can attract users of all kinds from the state.

Please also be aware that Ubuntu channels are logged, many officially and all of them unofficially by individual users, and the contents of all channels are considered to be in the public domain. 

=== Channel Guidelines ===

These guidelines do not cover every single aspect of the Ubuntu channels' etiquette. Specific practices are encouraged and discouraged, according to these guidelines' intent as well as to practical channel needs. Recommendations from channel operators, including those stored in the channel bots, should be followed.

'''The <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/community/conduct|Code of Conduct]]</nowiki> should always be obeyed'''
 This one should not need further explanation, the Code of Conduct forms the basics of the pleasant atmosphere in Ubuntu. Being nice to each other, being cooperative and respecting each other is a must.
'''Don't flood the channel'''
 Flooding the channel disrupts all conversations. Please don't do it. If you want to show large texts, such as errors, use <nowiki>[[http://paste.ubuntu.com|the pastebin]]</nowiki>
'''Don't use public away messages'''
 <nowiki>[[http://sackheads.org/~bnaylor/spew/away_msgs.html|Really, dont!]]</nowiki> Imagine 600 people doing that. It's not a pretty sight. Changing your nick to user-away is frowned upon. If you use away messages, you may get kicked without warning. Given that you are away, a warning would not help anyway; consider a kick to be a warning since it can be followed by a ban if you don't stop using them. On that same thread, you shouldn't spam the channel with the music you are playing currently. If you want to set away do it silently with "/away Reason" then when someone uses your name they are told you are away and the channel is not disturbed.
'''How to ask for help in the channel'''
 This is a little howto that explains how to get the best out of your experience looking for help <nowiki>[[http://www.sabi.co.uk/Notes/linuxHelpAsk.html|this link is not on the Ubuntu site]]</nowiki>.
'''Time to ask'''
 The time of day at which you ask will influence who reads the question. People may not be there with the answers, please be patient.
'''Don't repeat your question if it is not answered immediately'''
 We do our best to answer them all but are not omniscient. If you don't get answers immediately, please wait a while before asking again. If no one answers: don't get mad, maybe no one who is around right now knows. You can always try the Forum or Mailing List. 
'''Language and Subject'''
 All the #ubuntu channels are visited by people whose ages vary, and whose tolerances of language and subject choice vary equally as much. Please be considerate of everyone and keep all the #ubuntu channels family friendly. Please be aware that there are limits to behaviour and subjects. When using any #ubuntu channel, please avoid the use of swearing and take touchy subject choices such as war, race, religion, politics (unless related to software licencing), gender, sexuality, drugs,  questionable legal activities, removing of ones self from the planet are taken to other channels such as #off-topic or ##politics. (Note <nowiki>[[http://freenode.net/policy.shtml#offtopic|Freenode Policy]]</nowiki> when you join those channels.)
'''Don't be annoying'''
 Flooding, away messages, repeating, CTCPs and bot abuse are not the only ways you can be annoying. Personal attacks when things don't go as planned, continued misbehaving after you have been advised against, and similar behaviour will be rewarded with a ban.
'''When helping: be helpful'''
 We welcome any help, but we do ask you to stay as helpful as possible. There are heaps of information available on the wiki, the forums, and at other places. Try to familiarize yourself with that information. Telling people to RTFM is not very polite. Please try to avoid outdated, or possibly wrong information. 
'''Please don't enable talking scripts'''
 This includes !seen scripts, can you imagine if just five or six people had one enabled against ! and someone called it? That's half a dozen lines of spam which is just not needed. Please "/msg seenserv <nick>" instead.
'''Here are several common questions that get asked time and again'''
 <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CommonQuestions|Common Questions]]</nowiki> that get asked time and again on IRC, they may save you frustration and time if you check it out.

=== Disputes ===

If you disagree with the decision of an operator, then talk to that operator about it in a polite manner. Cursing and swearing will not help, so please don't do that. If talking to the operator personally does not give you a solution you like, you are more than welcome to join the operators channel.
