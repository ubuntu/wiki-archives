== Working on Online Accounts ==

=== Source code repositories ===

The list of projects related to Online Accounts used in Ubuntu is listed in the home page for the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/online-accounts|Online Accounts project]]</nowiki> in launchpad.

Most projects in Online Accounts are developed in gitlab.com, in collaboration with other people from KDE and Sailfish OS.
Such projects are part of the <nowiki>[[https://gitlab.com/groups/accounts-sso|accounts-sso]]</nowiki> group; note, however, that not all of these projects are used in Ubuntu.

==== Importing code in Launchpad ====

In order to be handled by the <nowiki>[[https://requests.ci-train.ubuntu.com|CI train]]</nowiki> used in Ubuntu, all projects need to have their code hosted in Launchpad. The procedure to import the code from gitlab.com to launchpad is described <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/OnlineAccounts/SyncBzrFromGit|here]]</nowiki>.

=== Making an upstream release ===

In order to speed up the process of making a release of a project hosted in gitlab.com, I'm using  <nowiki>[[attachment:arelease.sh|this script]]</nowiki>.
