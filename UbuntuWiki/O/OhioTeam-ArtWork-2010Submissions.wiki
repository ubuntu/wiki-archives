To view or contribute artwork, select "Attachments" from the drop-down menu above.  All files are attached to '''''this page''''', so to use in other pages you'll have to copy the files locally and then re-attach them.  For those of you who are accustomed to Mediawiki's central storage model, this is (apparently) MoinMoin's way of dealing with file naming conflicts and other such stuff. 

== Official Logo ==

== Branding Update ==
As of 10.04, Ubuntu has some <nowiki>[[Brand|fancy new branding]]</nowiki>. It would be nice to see something new for the Ohio team as well. Post your submissions here and we'll decide as a team what to use. Please keep in mind the <nowiki>[[http://design.canonical.com/the-toolkit/ubuntu-brand-guidelines/|Ubuntu Brand Guidelines]]</nowiki>. Vector assets to work from are available as a part of the brand guidelines PDF.

| The previous with the right flag edge softened. (Personal favorite)

Colors can change as the original branding does.
Feel free to derive from these: my Inkscape workspace is available <nowiki>[[attachment:jpeddicord-workspace.svg|here]]</nowiki>. (Fonts are not available; text is rendered using paths.)
