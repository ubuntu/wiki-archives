=== What are ReLoCos? ===
``Re``Lo``Cos stands for Really Local Communities.  Hopefully by having Really ``Lo``Co teams within Ohio we can more directly serve our communities.  At the present time we are looking to reconstitute active ``Re``Lo``Cos.  

=== ReLoCo Activities ===

A ``Re``Lo``Co often centers around "Ubuntu Hours" which are a sort of office hours/general social meeting time time.  During the "Ubuntu Hour" we will meet and talk about Ubuntu and the team, eat, and whatever else we have decided.  Generally, meetings should be held at places with ``Wi``Fi.  Meeting locations can be restaurants, libraries, colleges and universities, and many other places!

Once these can be scheduled on a consistent basis throughout the state we can then announce the reconstitution of ``Re``Lo``Co teams.

=== Teams ===

The are currently no active ``Re``Lo``Cos pending restructuring and reorganization.

=== Contact Info ===

Please send email to the mailing list (ubuntu-us-ohio@lists.launchpad.net) to locate fellow Ubuntu enthusiasts throughout the state so that you can organize times where you can come together for fun and fellowship.
