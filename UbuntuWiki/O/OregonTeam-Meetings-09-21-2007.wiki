Summary from Oregon team meeting at 7:30 PM on 09/21/2007

Sadly I completely forgot about the meeting and did not think about it till two days later; that was the last day of work before I moved to Corvallis to take classes at LBCC/OSU.

The agenda will be rolled over to the next meeting on the 26th of October

== Agenda ==
* Upcoming Events
* Team projects
** Open
** PNW Art Package
** Closed
** Software Freedom Day
** New
** Library Distribution
* Other
** Possible future meeting places - Linux Clinic?
** All these could also apply to the PNW team as a whole
*** Oregon team Launchpad page
*** Oregon Linux Blog
*** Gutsy Install party
*** Easily Accessable Ubuntu CD Distrobution Point (ie, setup an Oregon/PNW website that people could easily request CD's and we could ship to them.  Much faster than shipit)
*** Compile a list of our hardware with what works and doesn't, any hoops we had to jump though and submit it to the hardware/laptop teams

== Transcription ==
None :(
