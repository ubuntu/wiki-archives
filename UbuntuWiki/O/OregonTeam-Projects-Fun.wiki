__TOC__


The goal is to have something at 2 cities in July; Portland & someplace south (Eugene or Salem)

== Geeknic ==
 
''What is a Geeknic?''

A geeknic is a picnic for geeks.   ''' http://geeknic.org/ '''   Anywhere there are geeks, a geeknic should happen.

=== The Plan ===

We are going to be meeting outdoors (something unusual for some us geeks) and having a good time. We'll have burgers, hotdogs, and some other good grilling fun.

==== Possible locations ====

* Suggestions?

== Installfest ==

Let's get together to do installations of Ubuntu 

* All skill levels from complete novice to expert are welcome. 
* Newer users can bring their computers along - experienced users are able to help with getting started, troubleshooting problems, etc.  
* It's an advocacy and community-building event

=== Todo list ===

Where should it be?

What to bring 
* Power strips
* Network switches
Other details
* Fliers
* Any possibility of some live music?
