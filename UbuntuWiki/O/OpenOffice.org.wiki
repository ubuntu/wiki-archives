--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I am a dedicated ubuntu "nut" as some say. I tell everyone about ubuntu and how it is totally free and a full featured OS. I have used fedora, openSuse, zorin OS, and others but I keep coming back to ubuntu.
My brainstorm page is:
