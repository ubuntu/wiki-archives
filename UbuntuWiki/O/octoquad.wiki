=== About Me ===
I've been a GNU/Linux user for almost six years now and have finally decided to get involved with Ubuntu and the Ubuntu Gnome project. Since Web Development is where I started off, I've always been interested in building desktop applications and understanding how an OS is put together from the ground up.
