== OUT OF DATE ==
'''This is totally out of date, please refer to <nowiki>[[5-A-Day#Automatic%20Reporting|this documentation]]</nowiki>.'''

== Old instructions ==

This step is optional, but will automatically report your bug numbers and update your signature file if you like it to. Also http://qa.ubuntu.com/reports/five-a-day/ generates statistics from that data.

=== Reporting to the 5-A-Day log ===

1. Add the following line to your `/etc/apt/sources.list`: 
** For Intrepid: <pre>
deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/5-a-day/ubuntu intrepid main</pre>
** For Hardy: <pre>
deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/5-a-day/ubuntu hardy main</pre>
** For Gutsy: <pre>
deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/5-a-day/ubuntu gutsy main
deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/bughelper-dev/ubuntu gutsy main
deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/bzr/ubuntu gutsy main</pre><<BR>>You can also use the "Software Sources" Editor: <<BR>> <nowiki>[[File:apt-sources.png]]</nowiki>
1. Install the `five-a-day` package: <pre>
sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install five-a-day</pre>
1. Tell `5-a-day` which Launchpad user you have: <pre>
bzr launchpad-login <LP Login Name></pre> - please note: this is not the email address you used for signing up for LP, but the last part of the URL that https://launchpad.net/people/+me redirects you to (everything behind the `~` sign). <<BR>> e.g. The user `dholbach` would type in: <pre>
bzr launchpad-login dholbach</pre>
# If you haven't done so, add your <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/people/+me/+editsshkeys|SSH key to Launchpad]]</nowiki>. If you don't have an SSH key, follow the instructions on <nowiki>[[LaunchpadStepByStepInstructions|this page]]</nowiki> to generate one. (Else 5-A-Day is not going to work.)
# Run `5-a-day --add`: <pre>
5-a-day --add <bugnumbers></pre> For example: <pre>
5-a-day --add 123456 123457 123458 123459 123460
</pre>
1. Done. :-) ''(Please note: you can also use the 5-A-Day applet - see <nowiki>[[5-A-Day-Reporting#Applet|below]]</nowiki>.)''

''Further notes:''
* ''If you're part of a LoCo Team, <nowiki>[[5-A-Day-Reporting#Team|participate]]</nowiki> in 5-a-day for your team.''
* ''If you participate in a <nowiki>[[RunningBugJam|Bug Jam]]</nowiki>, ask for the name of the tag you agreed to use and <nowiki>[[5-A-Day-Reporting#Tag|set it in 5-a-day]]</nowiki>.''

=== Update ~/.signature ===

# Follow the steps above.
# Run: <pre>
5-a-day --update</pre> and it will automatically update your signature. (It will also preserve an old `~/.signature` file if it finds it.)
1. Make sure your mail client picks up the shiny new `~/.signature`.

=== Generate a blog "signature" ===

# Follow the steps above.
# Run: <pre>
5-a-day --update --html</pre> and it will spit out HTML code you can add to your blog entry.

=== 5-A-Day Applet ===

# Add the PPAs as mentioned above.
# Run <pre>
sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install five-a-day-applet</pre>
# Right-click on your GNOME panel, add the 5-A-Day applet to it.
# Work on a bug as mentioned above.
# Drag the Firefox / Epiphany tab on the applet, done.

Check out this <nowiki>[[http://launchpadlibrarian.net/12228307/5-a-day-applet_1.mpeg|video]]</nowiki> to see how it works.

=== Contribute within your LoCo Team ===

We explicitly want LoCo teams to be in this. Sure the `motu` team would do great, the `bugsquad` too but that would be cheating, wouldn't it? :-)

1. Run <pre>
5-a-day --add-team <your LoCo Team's LP ID></pre> for example: <pre>
5-a-day --add-team ubuntu-berlin</pre> ('''Note:''' You need to be a member of that team.)
# If you're unsure what your team's Launchpad ID is, 
## check out <nowiki>[[https://edge.launchpad.net/people/+me/+participation|your Launchpad team participation page]]</nowiki>.
## find the '''LoCo''' team you're member of <<BR>> <nowiki>[[File:identify-loco.png]]</nowiki>
## click on it
## check out the URL in the URL bar of your browser <<BR>> <nowiki>[[File:loco-id.png]]</nowiki>

=== Tagging 5-A-Day Bugs ===

This new feature is particularly useful during events like <nowiki>[[UbuntuHugDay|Hug Days]]</nowiki> or <nowiki>[[RunningBugJam|Bug Jams]]</nowiki>.

# Make sure you have `five-a-day` version `>= 0.26` installed.
# Run <pre>
5-a-day --add-tag tag-you-are-going-to-use
</pre>
# Add 5-A-Day bugs as usual.
# ...
# Run <pre>
5-a-day --remove-tag tag-you-are-going-to-use
</pre> to stop using the particular tag.
