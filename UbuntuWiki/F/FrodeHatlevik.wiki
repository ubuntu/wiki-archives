Email: 
I am a systems engineer specializing in network management and user training. I live in Bergen, Norway, and are at present finnishing a Master's degree in Adult Education.

I am trying to get Kubuntu to work on my ASUS A3HF laptop. I'll give it a go, and post my success story later on.

==== Update 2006-10-25 ====
I have returned my ASUS laptop to the store. It was OK performancewice, but the screen was no good. I bought myself an Acer TM 4672 LMi instead, and I am happy with that, though it was twice the money.

I'll try to install Kubuntu on it later on, but I have to concentrate on my Master's thesis for the time being. Hope to be back soon with more info.

;)Frode
