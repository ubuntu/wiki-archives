==== Packaging Jam ====
Saturday, October 3, from 12-6pm in Orlando, <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:cary-haynie]]</nowiki> will be running a Packaging Jam at Stardust Video ( <nowiki>[[http://tinyurl.com/lsn779 | map]]</nowiki> ).

We will be running a demonstration using a simple package, then letting people start on their own packages, and will be available to answer questions.  Participants should understand how to use a terminal, use a text editor, install packages via a command line, and how to navigate around launchpad.

We'll start from the beginning and make no assumptions as to pre-installed software.

==== Doc Jam ====
<nowiki>[[Launchpad:pak33m]]</nowiki> will be working on the FloridaTeam wiki redux :) 

It would be great if the FloridaTeam could continue from last weekend at the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FloridaTeam/Events/OrlandoMeetup | OrlandoMeetup]]</nowiki> to further collaborate on the FloridaTeam wiki redux.
