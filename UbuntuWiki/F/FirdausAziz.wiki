== About Me ==
Firdaus bin Aziz is just another ordinary Ubuntu user from <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur|Kuala Lumpur]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia|Malaysia]]</nowiki>. I started using Ubuntu in November 2004 and around the same time registered as a user at UbuntuForums. Eventhough Ubuntu has been my primary destop since January 2005, I have still yet to master all the intrinsic skills of and knowledge of a GNU/Linux guru. Most of the questions that I answered are in the beginners section. In March 2006 I was honoured with the responsibility as a forum staff.

== Contributions ==
* Forum staff since March 2006.
* Volunteer at the FOSS booth in <nowiki>[[http://blog.aizatto.com/index.php/category/my/pcfair-2006-august/|Kuala Lumpur PC Fair]]</nowiki> in August 2006. Talking to the visiting public on FOSS (in general) and Ubuntu.
* Recommended Ubuntu to lecturers and fellow students.
