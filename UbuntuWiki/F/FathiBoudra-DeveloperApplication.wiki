== Who I am ==
I'm a Qt/KDE passionate and involved in these communities. In real life, I work for Linaro as release manager and engineer/developer in my spare time.

== My Ubuntu story ==
It started with Debian as I'm a Debian Developer since 2007. I mostly working around Qt and KDE packages, sharing, syncing and merging with Kubuntu. A lot of work is common and I'd like to push improvements to Kubuntu as well.

=== My involvement ===
=== Examples of my work / Things I'm proud of ===
Debian Qt/KDE maintainer since a long time now...

=== Areas of work ===
It's pretty clear: Qt and KDE.

=== Things I could do better ===
Reduce Kubuntu developers workload. Asking for uploading, syncing, merging my own packages in Ubuntu is a waste of time for everybody.
Help to push Kubuntu on ARM ;)

== Plans for the future ==
=== General ===
=== What I like least in Ubuntu ===
I'm probably more conservative in the patches to apply, imo some changes are a bit risky.
