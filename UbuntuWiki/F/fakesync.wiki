__TOC__

A fakesync is done in cases where we wish to sync a package available in some Debian repository at the time of the fakesync but cannot because of differing tarballs, and where the tarballs do not differ sufficiently to require any changes in packaging to handle the differences.

=== Process ===

# A fakesync should use a revision of ''-XfakesyncY'', starting with ''-Xfakesync1''.
# Prior Ubuntu changelog entries should be dropped when performing a fakesync.
# The Maintainer Field doesn't need to be updated.

=== Tools ===

The script '''syncpackage''' can detect and create fakesyncs. It is available in the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubuntu-dev-tools|ubuntu-dev-tools]]</nowiki> package.
