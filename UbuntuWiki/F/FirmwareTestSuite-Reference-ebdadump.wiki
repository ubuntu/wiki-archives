=== Firmware Test Suite - ebdadump utility ===

This utility locates the Extended BIOS Data Area (EBDA) and produces a hex dump of the data. The
EBDA can contain firmware generated dynamic data structures such as MultiProcessor "floating" table headers
and perhaps the ACPI Root System Description Pointer (RSDP).

An example output is as follows:

<pre>
Dump EBDA region.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test 1 of 1: Dump EBDA region.
EBDA region: 9d800..a0000 (10240 bytes)
  9d800: 02 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................

==== Examples: ====

<pre>
sudo fwts ebdadump - 
</pre>

..runs the ebdadump on your machine and dumps the output to stdout.
