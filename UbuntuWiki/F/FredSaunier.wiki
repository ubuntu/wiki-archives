__TOC__

== About me ==

I am a computer enthusiast, gradually migrating to the GNU/Linux world, taking in my trail as many people as possible. This shouldn't be such a difficult task, as GNU/Linux, especially with the Ubuntu flavor, is such a pleasure to use.

== Involvement ==

I am currently participating to the project by translating screencasts into French.
