|-
| '''Track'''
| '''Topics'''
|-
| Foundations/Kernel
| Move to i586/i686 architecture support:  This has the potential to provide us improved boot performance.
|-
| Foundations
| Move to Eclipse 3.4 or 3.5:  The current 3.2 level is apparently limiting some java developers from switching over to Ubuntu
|-
| Foundations
| oem-config for Corporate Services: Provide the ability to create a "'''''golden'''''" ISO image used to deploy a previously tested configuration to users, that allows inclusion of binary packages and support for encrypted partitions at install.
|-
| Foundations
| oem-config for OEM Services: Improvements that oem customers have requested or suggested by OEM Services engineers.
|-
| Foundations/Server
| Server Installer: support for RAID+LVM installer targets via automatic partitioner, support for encrypted partition installer targets, help text for the installer process, improve look and feel of graphical installer
|-
| Foundations
| Repository Management: Users with large (+200) installations, where IT has set processes and policies around software updates that employees must follow, need an '''*easy*''' way to setup an internal package repository to deploy updates and customized packages internally.
|-
| Foundations
| Kickstart: Ensure that we are fully compatible with Kickstart for the most common requirements and everything that is used through our installer including RAID+LVM, encrypted partitions, RHEL Kickstart file compatibility
|-
| Foundations/Server
| iSCSI Installer Support: iSCSI provides a simple and cost-effective way for server admins to deploy SANs, because it uses the same IP network equipment that the user already has for standard networking, i.e. ethernet switches and standard network interface cards. Currently, the Ubuntu Server installer does not seamlessly support installing or booting from iSCSI.
|-
| Foundations
| Replace gnome-speech with a more flexible speech backend, usable by both GUI and console accessibility applications alike. Gnome-speech is GNOME specific, and will be going away upstream, however the next best alternative speech-dispatcher, needs extra work before its a viable alternative to be used with Orca and Linux accessibility applications in general.
|-
| Foundations
| build a automatic test/embargo system that allows new package uploads (e.g. after post beta) only if they install/upgrade cleanly from the previous package using the cloud
|-
| Foundations
| implement multiarch support in gcc, binutils, dpkg, apt so that we can get rid of the ia32-libs horror once and for all
|-
| Foundations
| implement ucf-like functionality directly in dpkg for all conffiles so all packages get it
|-
| Foundations/Kernel
| Provide a means to "reset a computer for resale" which erases personal data and '''also''' resets linked modules.
|-
| Foundations/Kernel
| Switch to using a swap file, instead of a partition, to allow for on-the-fly resizing
|-
| Foundations/Kernel
| KMS on the console
|-
| Foundations
| packaging and upgrade policy for `upstart`
|-
| Foundations
| '''Roundtable:''' tutorial for using upstart and converting to it
|-
| Foundations
| First day? presentation/roundable - Boot performence targets and budgets
| need foundations, kernel, desktop, dx, X, etc. people
|-
| Foundations
| Discuss a more robust python packaging that is less sensitive to unpack/configure ordering
|-
| Foundations
| aufs based release upgrades? how about hardware/memory requirments? do we have figures for this?)
