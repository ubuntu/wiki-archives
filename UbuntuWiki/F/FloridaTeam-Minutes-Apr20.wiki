(09:07:30 PM) Ax3: yea i dunno why
(09:07:30 PM) dantalizing: that was a great idea, not sure why we didnt think of it before, thx
(09:07:42 PM) Ax3: what was a great idea?
(09:07:54 PM) dantalizing: Ax3: to put up rss for the website
(09:08:00 PM) Ax3: oh :)
(09:08:04 PM) Catsceo: deedeedee

(09:10:30 PM) pak33m: !opensoap
(09:10:33 PM) dantalizing: and by 'bulging' i mean 1
(09:10:57 PM) pak33m: help us understand dantalizing
(09:11:06 PM) pak33m: how to 
(09:11:07 PM) dantalizing: well i'm 33, vegetarian
(09:11:09 PM) dantalizing: oh
(09:11:18 PM) pak33m: no, thats me
(09:11:27 PM) dantalizing: just spreading the meme
(09:12:02 PM) pak33m: whats involved with folding dantalizing
(09:12:05 PM) naufragio: such a confusing meeting
(09:12:22 PM) pak33m: naufragio: what do you mean i dont have control
(09:12:30 PM) pak33m: hehe
(09:13:05 PM) dantalizing: the folding at home project is basically a distributed computing project to simulate protiens, RNA and other icky stuff
(09:13:46 PM) dantalizing: its scientific research, distributed
(09:13:53 PM) pak33m: dantalizing: will you make it a porject
(09:13:59 PM) dantalizing: ok
(09:14:03 PM) dantalizing: taskmaster
(09:14:56 PM) pak33m: dantalizing: how we we get involved in folding
(09:15:10 PM) dantalizing: pak33m: download the client from the folding at home website
(09:15:15 PM) Ax3: so should I add in another trigger for Ubuntu Florida Local Community ?
(09:15:17 PM) dantalizing: configure it for team # 1231668
(09:15:21 PM) dantalizing: oops
(09:15:24 PM) dantalizing: team #123168
(09:15:52 PM) Ax3: cuz now we have http://florida.ubuntu-us.org/index2.php?option=ds-syndicate&version=1&feed_id=3 and http://florida.ubuntu-us.org/planet/atom.xml
(09:15:54 PM) pak33m: dantalizing: so its sharing power, what
(09:15:55 PM) dantalizing: Ax3 only if you promise to use it in the Georgia channel exclusively
(09:16:00 PM) PocketBrain: I like the "Improve hardware support" comment; the latest version finally installed and runs on my new laptop.
(09:16:24 PM) dantalizing: pak33m: its sharing compute power
(09:16:27 PM) Ax3: hey i think it's useful :p
(09:17:02 PM) pak33m: dantalizing: and what are the benefits?
(09:17:08 PM) dantalizing: calculations are distributed, in effect, making a massively parallel distributed computing engine for complex equations
(09:17:11 PM) pak33m: for those who dont know
(09:17:30 PM) dantalizing: Ax3 i like it, but on demand
(09:17:36 PM) dantalizing: not random
(09:17:48 PM) Ax3: i don't think it's random
(09:17:54 PM) dantalizing: and most in here dont wanna know what gatorlug is doing
(09:18:01 PM) pak33m: dantalizing: does it have some *green* benfits
(09:18:10 PM) dantalizing: pak33m: it is anti-green
(09:18:24 PM) PocketBrain: ? anti-green?
(09:18:34 PM) pak33m: no really?
(09:18:35 PM) dantalizing: pak33m: its basically donating your compute cycles to science
(09:18:43 PM) pak33m: i mean is it really
(09:18:57 PM) dantalizing: well, if you leave your computer on computing all night, isnt it more 'green' to turn off you pc?
(09:18:59 PM) Catsceo: FOLDING@HOME
(09:19:07 PM) Catsceo: DO IT
(09:19:14 PM) Catsceo: NAO
(09:19:15 PM) pak33m: dantalizing: not if i have dantalizing pinging me all night
(09:19:29 PM) PocketBrain: 99% of people folding would be leaving their computers on anyway, and you save the power and materials the universities would be using for the supercomputers required to do a tiny, tiny fraction of what the distributed project does... so is it green?
(09:19:30 PM) pak33m: Catsceo: was that Cantoneese for NOW
(09:19:34 PM) dantalizing: but, if you have somethign running 24x7 all the time anyway, sitting idle 99% of the time, you should add the folding@ home client
(09:19:47 PM) Catsceo: pak33m: no, it was internet for now
(09:19:48 PM) Tanizaki: dantal is gonig to walk to the hardy party so he can be "green"
(09:20:08 PM) dantalizing: yes, i have t leave now
(09:20:22 PM) Tanizaki: good luck!
(09:20:34 PM) dantalizing: to compensate for being abandoned in the woods while hitchhiking
(09:20:38 PM) pak33m: Tanizaki: i think i will since it right down that street from my wokr
(09:21:02 PM) pak33m: its a team project
(09:21:31 PM) Tanizaki: I am going to drive down there in my SUV that has whale skin hubcaps and baby seal eyes for headlights
(09:21:40 PM) Lapu74: lol
(09:21:45 PM) dantalizing: mmm...dinner time
(09:21:58 PM) pak33m: Anybody have anything else for the meeting?
(09:22:01 PM) dantalizing: pak33m: i'll work on the elevator pitch and put up a project page
(09:22:06 PM) Tanizaki: while eating big macs from MCDonalds in the old styrofoam containers
(09:22:26 PM) dantalizing: Tanizaki lies...he doesnt eat big macs
