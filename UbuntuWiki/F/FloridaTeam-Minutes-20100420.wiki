[19:05:11] <itnet7> I am planning to send out an e-mail to all of the current LP Mailing List subscribers asking them to switch over by like June 1st
[19:05:40] <itnet7> if they don't move over I will manually invite them over to the other list, and they will have the option to join or not
[19:06:16] <itnet7> govatent said he was going to work on this with me, but he has been pretty busy with school, he should be able to give me hand after this weekend though!
[19:06:46] <MichelleQ> sounds like a plan to me
[19:06:47] <itnet7> He said to say Hi to the team, but things are crazy at school for him right now, and he needs to buckle downn until this semester is over
