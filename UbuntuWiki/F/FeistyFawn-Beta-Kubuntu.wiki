== Introduction ==
Feisty Fawn, the name of the latest development branch of Kubuntu, extends the new infrastructure that landed in Edgy Eft and branches out in some exciting new directions. Feature developments in the Feisty Fawn release include improvements to hardware support on laptops, desktops, and high-end servers and aggressive adoption of emerging desktop technologies.

The Beta release is the sixth in a series of milestone CD images that will be released throughout the Feisty development cycle as images known to be reasonably free of CD-build or installer bugs.
