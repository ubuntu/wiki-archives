	''This page describes fonts in general.  For the 2010 brand/logo typeface, see <nowiki>[[Ubuntu Font Family]]</nowiki>.''
== Fonts ==

=== Installing downloaded fonts in Ubuntu 10.04 LTS ===

Open the folder where you have downloaded the font file. 

Double click on the font file to open it. This opens a font viewer window.

On the right there is a button, "Install Font".  Click on it.

Wait until the button turns to greyed out "Installed".

=== Installing new fonts ===
This section describes two ways for how to install new fonts in Ubuntu.

The first uses the <nowiki>[[SynapticHowto|Synaptic Package Manager]]</nowiki> to install fonts from the Ubuntu repositories. As new fonts get added to the archive, this method offers fonts suitable for an increasing number of users, and is very easy.

The second method is useful if you have downloaded fonts from the web, bought them, or acquired them from other sources. It is a bit more manual, but allows you to use fonts (including restricted fonts when you can't find a free/libre/open font equivalent) from a wide range of sources.

Finally, at the end of this page, there are some links for further information on fonts on GNU/Linux.

==== Via Synaptic ====

Packages available through Synaptic are mostly programs, tools and libraries, but there are a few font packages in the system.

You will need to <nowiki>[[Repositories|enable the Universe and Multiverse repositories]]</nowiki> to get all the fonts available. See AddingRepositoriesHowto for instructions, and SynapticHowto if you need more information on Synaptic.

Once the repositories are set up, search for "font" in Synaptic. You should get a list of over a hundred packages. (If you get far less, then you may need to press Reload, to make sure your repository data is up to date.) Not all of these packages are fonts, some are font utilities for editing or managing fonts. Clicking on a package will show a description.

The '''msttcorefonts''' package contains the Microsoft freeware (non-Free because they are non-modifiable) web fonts. (Note: ''Most'' Microsoft fonts are included in this package; however, it does not include Tahoma or Arial Narrow.  For more information on installing msttcorefonts please refer to RestrictedFormats

As of Jaunty (9.04), this package is named '''ttf-mscorefonts-installer'''.

<!> '''Note:''' After you install a new font, you will need to make sure that programs in which you want to use the new fonts can recognize them. In most cases this is done by closing and reopening the programs; however, some programs may require you to log out and log back in.

==== Manually ====

There are various locations in GNU/Linux in which fonts can be kept. These locations are defined in <code>/etc/fonts/fonts.conf</code>; standard ones include <code>/usr/share/fonts</code>, <code>/usr/local/share/fonts</code>, and <code>~/.fonts</code>.

The easiest way to install a '''truetype font''' is to press alt-F2 and enter the following code (this will open nautilus in the right directory):

<pre>
gksu nautilus /usr/share/fonts/truetype
</pre>

Then create a new directory, name the directory whatever you like (choose a name that you remember) and copy the fonts into that directory

If you need to backup your personal fonts, you should use the '''~/.fonts/''' folder. To create the folder and install the font "Example.otf":

<pre>
sudo mkdir -p "~/.fonts/truetype/choose_a_font_folder_name_here"
sudo cp Example.otf "~/.fonts/truetype/choose_a_font_folder_name_here"
</pre>

Not always needed, but finally you can additionally rebuilding the font information files by pressing alt-F2, mark 'run in terminal' so you can see the progress and entering the following code:

<pre>
sudo fc-cache -f -v
</pre>

<!> '''Note:''' After you install a new font, you will need to make sure that programs in which you want to use the new fonts can recognize them. In most cases this is done by closing and reopening the programs; however, some programs may require you to log out and log back in.

The easiest place for people to put their fonts is <code>/home/<username>/.fonts</code>. If you have not already done so, create this folder:
* Open your home folder in Nautilus (GNOME) or Konqueror (KDE).
* Since dot-folders are really hidden folders, you need to choose "Show Hidden Files" from the View menu.
* Go to '''File -> Create Folder''' (GNOME), or right-click and choose '''Create New -> Folder''' (KDE).
* Name the new folder ".fonts".
Now double click on the folder to open it, and drag and drop your fonts into the folder.

On GNOME, you can also directly open the virtual folder <code>fonts:/</code> (within a Nautilus window, choose '''Go -> Location''' or press '''Ctrl+L''') and drag and drop fonts into this folder. (Does not work in in Hardy Heron 8.04 due to changes. Please follow the method above.)

However, fonts that are added by either of the ways above will only be available for one user. To make them available system-wide, drag and drop them to the directory <code>/usr/share/fonts</code>. (Note: If you're on Kubuntu you may have to <code>cd</code> to <code>/usr/share/fonts</code> and run <code>mkfontscale</code>, <code>mkfontdir</code>, <code>fc-cache</code> after this. See the instructions below.)

As in the last method, on GNOME you can also add fonts directly to <code>fonts:/</code>. However, you must open the virtual folder as root. You can do this by opening a terminal window and running
<pre>
gksudo nautilus fonts:
</pre>

=== Enabling Bitmapped Fonts ===

If you'd like to use a bitmap font you just installed, you can enable Bitmap Fonts by these commands

<pre>
cd /etc/fonts/conf.d/
sudo rm -rf 70-no-bitmaps.conf && sudo ln -s ../conf.avail/70-yes-bitmaps.conf .
sudo dpkg-reconfigure fontconfig
</pre>

Logout, and log back in again, and you'll be able to select the newly installed fonts. For example, if you install the '''xfonts-100dpi''' package you should be able to lunch GIMP and choose "Lucida Medium" bitmap font using GIMP's Text Tool. This is tested working as of Ubuntu 18.04.

For use in terminals, font suggestions include terminus as suitable for terminals;to install this font in command line, run <code>apt-get install xfonts-terminus</code> or use Synaptic (see above). Alternatively, you can use <nowiki>[[http://www.levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html|Inconsolata]]</nowiki>, a monospaced font from Raph Levien. It is a very good font for the terminal. Or "fixed" which was the original <code>xterm</code> font who's 10pt semicondensed is compact and easy to read (a matter of taste of course).

==== Enabling a particular bitmap font ====

Beware though, that enabling bitmapped fonts may make e.g. Firefox use them too, and that may make some pages look horrible. E.g. <nowiki>[[http://jsbin.com/alemur/3/|an example page using "Lucida" font]]</nowiki> has jagged edges if all bitmapped fonts are enabled wholesale. Instead, I enabled exactly the <code>fixed</code> font I needed by (undoing the "70-yes-bitmaps.conf" steps above and) creating <code>/etc/fonts/conf.d/50-enable-fixed.conf</code> instead containing:

<pre>
<!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM "fonts.dtd">
<fontconfig>
  <selectfont>
    <acceptfont>
      <pattern>
        <patelt name="family"><string>fixed</string></patelt>
      </pattern>
    </acceptfont>
  </selectfont>
</fontconfig>
</pre>

Then run 
<pre>
sudo dpkg-reconfigure fontconfig
</pre>

Logout, and log back in again, and you'll be able to use the "fixed" font in terminals, at least in Gnome and XFCE. This was tested on Ubuntu 11.04 (Natty Narwhal).

=== Font settings ===

==== Font Smoothing ====

Arguably the best results for smooth fonts can be obtained quite easily by deactivating any kind of manual font configuration you might have:
<pre>
mv ~/.fonts.conf ~/fonts.conf.inactive
</pre>

Then go to System -> Preferences -> Appearance, select the Fonts tab, click the Details button. In the window appearing set the options as follows:

<nowiki>[[File:smoothing_settings.png|Font smoothing settings]]</nowiki>

Close the settings, log out and back in and enjoy the sharpest, smoothest fonts ever.

==== Manual Font Smoothing ====

The following relates to tweaking the anti-aliasing rules for the 'msttcorefonts' collection. It was contributed by Obi Bok but is now unmaintained.

 I'm currently working on font settings in XML (''.fonts.conf''). I noticed that after installing ''msttcorefonts'' things don't look quite as good in ''Firefox'' anymore. Most web pages request ''Arial'' which doesn't get hinted and anti-aliased too nicely, especially on LCD screens. I personally prefer the "sharp" non-anti-aliased look. I also noticed that many users coming from ''Windows®'' ask on the forums about getting fonts to look that way.

     Why was this conceived?

     - some font families look better hinted by Byte Code Interpreter (BCI)
       while other fonts look better hinted by Auto-Hinter
     - hinting type affects italic and bold fonts differently
     - antialiasing needs to be adjusted according to font families and sizes
     
     Essentially, there is no one single rule that works for all fonts.

     NOTE:
     - Verdana @ 8pt doesn't render '2' and '6' right
     - Arial shows 'Z' distorted in Firefox 1.5

     "The relationship of pixels to points depends on the number of pixels
     per inch, which is typically some 'standard' value corresponding to
     default screen fonts. For example, MS Windows has two standard sets of
     screen fonts initially designed for IBM display systems: 'small' (VGA)
     and 'large' (8514/A). 'Small' fonts are 96 pixels per inch, 'large' are
120. Macintosh systems render type at a nominal 72 pixels per inch, i.e.
     one pixel = one point. Some display systems using scalable screen fonts
     allow fine tuning of pixels per inch to suit user preferences."

Note, that the above shown fonts.conf xml is slightly buggy. It will interfere with utf/unicode characters in google chrome and render them as boxes or gibberish.

This happens due to replacement of FreeSans and FreeMono by Arial. Remove those 2 replacement blocks from the above xml to fix ut8/unicode fonts in google chrome.

For helvetica fonts, if they are present on your system, then autohint + slight hinting gives good clarity so you may want to add the following code block to your fonts.conf

<pre>

<match target="font">
 <test qual="any" name="family" compare="eq">

 </test>
 
 <edit name="antialias" mode="assign">

  <bool>true</bool>
 </edit>

<edit name="hintstyle" mode="assign">
  <const>hintslight</const>
 </edit>

</match>
</pre>

For the above to work , change the substitution of Helvetica by Arial binding to weak.

==== Complete revamp of fonts on ubuntu ====

Okay, now this is about getting your fonts look super cool and beautiful on ubuntu or any linux in general, specially the KDE desktop. This involves 2 steps :

1. Get better fonts like Droid fonts, Noto Sans

The fonts are available from <nowiki>[[http://www.google.com/fonts/|google web fonts]]</nowiki>.

2. Tweak the fonts.conf file.

For more information read the complete tutorial on how to get <nowiki>[[http://www.binarytides.com/gorgeous-looking-fonts-ubuntu-linux/|gorgeous fonts on ubuntu]]</nowiki>.
