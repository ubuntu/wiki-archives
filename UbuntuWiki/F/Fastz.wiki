Hi, I have been a supporter of Ubuntu Linux since 2005, when version 5.10 was released.  I have since installed Ubuntu on every computer I own, which are two laptops, a desktop computer, and a server computer running Ubuntu 7.10 server edition.  I am a firm believer in everything the FOSS movement is meant to be about.  I love the freedom that using Linux provides me and I openly confess its greatness to individuals who have never heard of it before or simply just never given it a chance.

I am currently a member of the Tennessee Ubuntu Team.
