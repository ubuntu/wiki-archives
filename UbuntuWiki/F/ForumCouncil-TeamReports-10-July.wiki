Ubuntu Forums Council - July 2010

1. <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1513563|LTSP Forums (suggestion)]]</nowiki> - For now we prefer if the <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=339|Server Platform]]</nowiki> section is used with a tag - '''''LTSP'''''. If / when traffic increases we can re-consider a subforum, but the impression is the traffic is low.

2. Request for an Ubuntu Youth Forum - This request was considered, but declined. The best summary of the FC is "We are a support forum and the entirety of the forums should be suitable for all ages."

3. Polls will be disabled in the support forums.
