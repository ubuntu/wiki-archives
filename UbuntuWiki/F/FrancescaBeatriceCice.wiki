=== Something about me ===
My name is Francesca Beatrice Cice. I'm a IT consultant and a IT journalist. 

I'm also founding member of PLIO (OpenOffice.org Italian Linguistic Project).

I'm a student of "Sicurity of networks and systems informatics" to University of Milan.

I work with linux system since 2000, and I first installed Ubuntu 5 years ago. I think that Ubuntu is a very good system to learn linux system for all people, expecially beginner.
So I decide to suggest others to accept Ubuntu in its project, also in business and educational environment.
