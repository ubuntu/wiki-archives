* Investigate why the session manager takes 4s before it starts the window manager (arguably one of the most important bits) (Desktop Team)
* Investigate 1s gap between start_pulseaudio finishing and seahorse starting (Desktop Team)
** Why does seahorse even depend on Pulse Audio? (Desktop Team)

* Compiz wrapper shell script duplicates much of the probing of the binary, and is expensive; why? (Desktop Team)
* Compiz takes 9s to start, why? (Desktop Team)
** XML parsing?
** relocations for every .so file loaded?

* GNOME Panel has high CPU usage about 5s after starting, is this being caused by an applet that's hidden by default? (keyring applet) (Desktop Team)

* Nautilus uses high CPU for several seconds after starting (Desktop Team)
** Looks like it's reading every single file on the desktop, home directory, Trash(!!), etc.
