=== Key Details ===

* '''Date''' - ''20 July 2010''
* '''Team Contacts''' - ChristopheSauthier , <nowiki>[[kinouchou]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[YoBoY]]</nowiki>, DidierRoche
* '''Membership''' - 
* '''Mailing List''' - ubuntu-fr on lists.ubuntu.com
* '''IRC''' - #ubuntu-fr (Ubuntu support only) on freenode

=== Roadmap ===
* '''Team meeting''' - Last meeting the 22th June 2010. We try to have one meeting every two months to talk to the community about our actions and the future events.
* '''New Design''' - We are working on a new design for our sites (<nowiki>[[http://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/projets/design2009|screenshots and project page]]</nowiki>. This design is for all our web tools (drupal, dokuwiki, fluxbb, planet) and also with different colors to all our flavours (kubuntu-fr.org, xubuntu-fr.org, edubuntu-fr.org). Next year we plan to switch to the new branding for the colors and logos.
* '''Ubuntu Party''' - We are listing, helping and organizing Ubuntu Parties in France for each Ubuntu releases <nowiki>[[http://ubuntu-party.org/]]</nowiki>
* '''Ubuntu Release Party''' - For each releases we invite all the French community to organize smaller events just after the release like a restaurant, a meeting in a bar or other place.
* '''Ubuntu Global Jam''' -  We plan to participate to this jam in Paris and Toulouse. We already are looking for a venue and people who can explain how to contribute in bug triage and in the French documentation. We plan to make a testing jam also.
* '''floss involvement''' - The French Team is involved in French groups in the floss advocacy, and participate in all linux and floss events who invite us.
* '''Ubuntu French LiveCD''' - We try to automate the creation of our French live CD. The <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/isocustomization|project is on Launchpad]]</nowiki> and we want to share it with all the others Locoteams who want to make a localized liveCD like us. We plan to produce a French LiveCD with all the programs and examples in French in the Live session for the Ubuntu 10.10. For the 10.04 we already produced 9000 CDs, we want to break this record for the next one.
* '''Ubuntu-fr T-Shirts''' - We try to produce a new t-shirt with a new design for the Ubuntu 10.10 release. Like the other times, we give this new t-shirt to all the benevolent people who are helping on our Ubuntu Party.
* '''Ubuntu-fr marketing kit''' - To help all the French Ubuntu user groups, we try to make a pack with a ubuntu-fr banner, stickers, flyers, and perhaps some other marketing goodies.
* '''Ubuntu-fr members''' - To improve the links in our French community, we are creating a new status similar to the Ubuntu members. We also are trying to make more links with the French Ubuntu user groups and help all the users to create if they want a group in their cities.

=== Experience ===

==== Online Activities ====
* '''Website''' - We have a web site <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu-fr.org]]</nowiki>, but we offer also the possibility to use <nowiki>[[http://www.kubuntu-fr.org]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[http://www.xubuntu-fr.org]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[http://www.edubuntu-fr.org]]</nowiki> with the same content but a different theme. <<BR>> We use also an other website to list the events related to Ubuntu in the French community <nowiki>[[http://ubuntu-party.org]]</nowiki>. We store links to media files of our events on this site <nowiki>[[http://ubuntu-party.org/multimedia|Photos and videos]]</nowiki>.

* '''Forum''' - Our French forum hold around 400.000 subjects and 3.300.000 posts. We have more than 1000 connected users using the forum every day, that should be added to the authentified ones. <<BR>> {{http://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/_media/wiki/ubuntu-fr-forum-chart.png|ubuntu-fr forum - New users registrations}}

We also add a link to the French book "Simple comme Ubuntu" on the desktop which is good for the beginners. We sell these CDs at our events for the symbolic price of 1€, and to all the French user groups in France and in the world with no extra costs.

* '''Framakey Ubuntu-fr Remix''' - A LiveUSB key made in partnership with <nowiki>[[http://framakey.org/En/Index|Framakey]]</nowiki>. The Framakey is a compilation of Windows and MacOSX programs which can work without installation on the OS. We add to it a complete persistent Ubuntu Live session sharing the configuration of the programs on each OS. Users can also install Ubuntu with this key. {{http://framakey.org/uploads/Pack/fkur_small.png|Framakey ubuntu-fr remix|align=center}}
* '''Ubuntu Release Party''' - We try to make events the week just after the release for each releases, to incite other French users to do the same in their cities. In Paris we have 50 people each time which is the limit of our venue.

* '''Ubuntu Party''' - For each cycle we hold Ubuntu Parties in Paris, in Toulouse and in various other cities in France (see list below), where we have installs, conferences and courses. We also help other user groups organize same type of events by providing them CDs, stickers, and promoting their events related to Ubuntu.

* '''Ubuntu Global Jam''' -  We participated in the global (bug) jam last year with a big success each time in Paris and in Toulouse. This year wasn't so lucky with some problems with our venue, we need a place open on the week end and which can hold more than 50 people, it's not easy to find such places.
* '''Other events''' - Some cities organize events, with the help of their LUGs, and invite us to come present Ubuntu. We also are attending in big events to present Ubuntu. We invite our community to go to some floss events like picnic to share with the community.
