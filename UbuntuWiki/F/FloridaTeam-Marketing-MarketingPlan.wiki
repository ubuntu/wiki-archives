== Marketing Plan ==

* Identify Floridians who would benefit from the use of Ubuntu, which is just about everyone. Except business enterprises with a heavy investment in Active Directory Services, .Net Framework based applications or other windows dependent technologies.

* Get the Ubuntu brand name out there, to regular people that may not understand how much commercial software really costs them. 

* Give out Live-CDs with the various flavors of Ubuntu (e.g. Kubuntu, Xubuntu, Edubuntu). Make sure that people understand that the Live-Cd isn't going to install anything unless they want it to.

* Design our own Stickers, fliers, posters, shirts, etc. and share them with other interested LoCo Teams.

* Contact other people that are working to promote Ubuntu and see how we can help each other. Start with the other American & English Speaking LoCo's and the Ubuntu Marketing Team.
