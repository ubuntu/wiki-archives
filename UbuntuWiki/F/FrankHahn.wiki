Email: 
Have used Linux since August 1995 when I found an early distribution of Slackware. Ran Slackware on a 486 as a home firewall/router until that machine died a few years ago. Have been running Ubuntu on a desktop as a server machine (email, spam filtering, personal web page development, etc).

Presently have Windows XP and Ubuntu 6.06 installed on a Gateway 7510GX laptop. Most things work under Ubuntu without problems.
