== Tips and tricks ==

 0. Check for updates with a GUI in Kubuntu.
  Kmenu -> Run Command -> Type 'kdesu adept_updater'

 0.  If you want to search and replace a certain string in multiple files use perl like this:
  {{{
   $ perl -i -p -e 's/search/replace/g' *.txt }}}

 0. Out of memory problems with MOL and Tiger?
  Get a new bootx from http://www-user.rhrk.uni-kl.de/~nissler/mol/bootx.gz like this: 
  {{{
   $ wget http://www-user.rhrk.uni-kl.de/~nissler/mol/bootx.gz
   
## dpkg-divert --add --rename /usr/share/mol/drivers/bootx

## gzip -c bootx.gz > /usr/share/mol/drivers/bootx }}}

 0. Need to execute X programs from the commandline with root privileges?
   Error: cannot connect to X server :0.0

   Fix: Run this command as the user logged in to the X session:
   {{{
   $ xhost +si:localuser:root }}}
  
   This will allow root connections to the X server.
   I have this command in  ~/.kde/Autostart/x-allow-root.sh

   Make sure your script is executable
   {{{
chmod +x ~/.kde/Autostart/x-allow-root.sh }}}
   

 0. Make kdesu ask the root password, instead of the user password.
   This is done in ~/.kde/share/config/kdesurc, it should look like this when su is selected:
   {{{
   frode@light:~ $ cat ~/.kde/share/config/kdesurc
   [super-user-command]
   super-user-command=su
   frode@light:~ $ }}}
   This is a per-user setting. If you want it system wide, put the file in /usr/share/kubuntu-default-settings/kde-profile/default/share/config/ instead.

   You might need to update the system config cache:
   {{{
   frode@light:~ $ kbuildsycoca --incremental }}}

   Now 'kdesu' use 'su' for it's authentication needs. This of course depends on a enabled root account which Ubuntu/Kubuntu does not have by default.
