== About Me ==

I'm a Lubuntu user and supporter, especially interested in efficient systems that make older machines run as good (or better!) than new ones. I used to use Xubuntu, and still like it, but I think that Xubuntu has evolved to a point where it is a better alternative to Ubuntu than it is an option for low-resource systems. About the time Xubuntu was getting a bit too heavy for my taste, LXDE had matured to the point where the Lubuntu projected filled the gap for me. I switched from Xubuntu to Lubuntu, and have been extremely pleased. 

I've used Ubuntu/Xubuntu/Lubuntu since Dapper 6.06, but I'm a non-coder and rarely work in the command line. For me, the beauty of these open systems is that they "'''just work.'''" And in my opinion, with its rock-solid core based on Debian/Ubuntu and the agile LXDE environment, Lubuntu does the best job of "just working" of any Linux distribution.

In addition to Lubuntu, I also use Puppy Linux and Windows. When I'm not inside, I enjoy hiking and cycling.
