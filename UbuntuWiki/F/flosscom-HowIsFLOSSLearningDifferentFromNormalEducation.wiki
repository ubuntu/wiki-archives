== Introduction ==

Introduction on how learning in FLOSS is different from normal education.

Firstly it is informal and not formal. 

This <nowiki>[[http://www.slideshare.net/jaycross/future-of-education/27|slideshare presentation]]</nowiki> provides a good overview on some of the differences. 

What else is different?

== Main Part ==

Learning in FLOSS might be different to normal education in various way.

- According to a definition ''"Learning is the organized procedure of knowledge construction on a pre-defined domain"''. If one accepts this definition, one must consider its details as well:

'''Organized''' means a certain ''linking'' between the offered "educational chunks", the ''continuity'' of the presented aspects, as well as the existence of ''educational goals and aims''.

'''Procedure''' means it does not simply happen as a learning instance, but merely it ''bases'' on prior cognitive results to proceed to more complicated structures.

'''Construction''' explicitly states the constructivist nature of learning.

'''Pre-defined''' implies a ''coverage'', a ''completness'' of the desired domain, and an ''inclusion'' of all neccessary learning activities.

For each of those presented points, one can consider the pending aspect in a FLOSS environment, in order to pinpoint similarities and differences between both models. In other words, how are those "educational components" faded in FLOSS?

== Advantages ==

What works well

== Criticism ==

What does not work that well, what needs to be improved, etc.

== Examples ==

Including practical activities

== How could it work in education? ==

Translation of FLOSS principles to education

- FLOSS learning is different from normal face-to-face learning because it is conducted online.  General standards of <nowiki>[[http://www.albion.com/netiquette/book/index.html|`Netiquette’]]</nowiki> should be observed.

Hurting other participant's feelings is likely to affect productivity.
