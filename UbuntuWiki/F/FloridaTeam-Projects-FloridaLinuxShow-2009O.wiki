From the <nowiki>[[http://www.floridalinuxshow.com/|Florida Linux Show]]</nowiki> website:
  The third Florida Linux Show 2009 will be held in the entertainment capital of Florida in the great city of Orlando.  A vacation hot spot because of Disney , UNIVERSAL , and Sea World , Orlando, like Jacksonville with its dedicated Linux users and city population deserves a world class Linux & Open Source Software conference and exhibit. The Florida Linux Show 2009 Orlando will be tapping into the Tampa, St. Petersburg, Miami, Melbourne, and Orlando LUGs for their Linux attendee base.
