== Introduction ==
My name is Francisco Calderón and I am venezuelan developer and Linux admin.  

I first started using Linux back in 1997 tired of the windows death blue screen, i started to looking for something diference in the *NIX flavors. At first, I used slackware, of course, the linux hackers distro ;) I tried with anothers good distributions like gentoo and fedora, but in the year 2004 a friend gave me a Ubuntu CD and the love began ;)
