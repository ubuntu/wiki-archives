=== Firmware Test Suite - oops test ===

This test scans for kernel oops messages.  The default is to scan the current kernel ring buffer, but one can also specify kernel message log files to scan too.  While this is not a firmware specific test it has been provided for free because the kernel oops checking code already existed in the s3 and s4 tests. 

==== Examples: ====

<pre>
sudo fwts oops - 
</pre>

..runs the oops test on your machine and dumps the output to stdout.

<pre>
fwts oops --klog=/var/log/kern.log
</pre>

..uses the /var/log/kern.log as input and dumps the output to the default log file results.log

All oopses are treated as a critical error.
