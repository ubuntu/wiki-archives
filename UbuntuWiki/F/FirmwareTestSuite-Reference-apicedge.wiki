=== Firmware Test Suite - apicedge test ===

This test sanity checks APIC irq edge/level configuration.  The rule of thumb is as follows:

* Interrupts < 16 should be edge triggered
* Interrupts >= 16 should be level triggered
* The ACPI interrupt should be level triggered.

The data is gathered from /proc/interrupts, parsed and checked.

==== Examples: ====

<code>fwts apicedge -</code>

..runs the test on your machine and dumps the output to stdout.

=== Explanation of test results ===

Certain test results may require a little more explanation. This section will try and give some context to specific test failures.
