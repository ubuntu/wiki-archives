== Summary ==

<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/example.png]]</nowiki> This page holds a temporary list of notes and ideas for discussion of the Gutsy +1 development forum procedures to be discussed by the FA team in subsequent meetings and approved by the Forum Council. It may evolve into a spec.

== Ideas ==

<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/info.png]]</nowiki> Below is a rough, unstructured, partially redundant list of ideas that were inspired by the shortcomings and failures of the Gutsy Idea Pool. Please add yours for discussion in meetings, and feel free to prettify and structure the list. In the following weeks/months, we should make these into a structured specification.

==== Subforums ====

* Separate forum with higher prerequisites for suggesting ideas? (alias: "'''Workplace'''") People don't just say "make a GUI for pppoeconf", they make a mockup of that GUI for a start. Separate area for ideas that don't meet these prerequisites (alias: "'''Brainstorm'''"). Can set specific defaults on this, in simple, non-spec terms: make a behavior description, make a mockup, gather some developers, find upstream bugs, find what work has been done already // make categories (fix outstanding bug #xyz, implement new feature, write new app from scratch etc.)
** In Workplace, first posts should hold things together. They should reveal all progress and status at a glance. Ambassadors aggressively edit first posts to provide details on implementation status, spec link, bug links, previous forum discussions on subject, external links, etc.
* Separate "would be nice to have" forum, that will cater for what Idea Pool pretty much ended up being. The idea is to make people know they're not placing a demand that's seen by those who will act on it, that they're just discussing.
** Possible title: Hugsy Hammond '''Brainstorm'''
** "Out of the box gamepad support" isn't really an "idea"; it's a statement of a wish for improvement based on an annoyance. The annoyance itself should be listed, like a bug title instead: "Ubuntu does not support most gamepads out of the box". Then, people who share the annoyance will chime in, and those with different approaches to solving the problem can suggest them. If progress is made, the thread (or part of it) can be moved to Workplace. 
** Separate annoyances forum for such threads? Things like the following can into it, instead of suggesting implementation: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=444858 or http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=410342 . Probably not a good idea.
** Separate forum for upstream requests / "write me a new app"s? Or do they go into Brainstorm? 
* Separate "bug hunt" forum? reward system? karma? LP integration? 
* Avoid too many forums. 

==== General DOs / DON'Ts ====

* Emphasize collaboration, not just "Idea Storm"ing
* Emphasize that people should write specs (interim pre-spec draft mechanism?), and FA will help them do so. FA won't write specs for people.
* Get specs written early , consult developers early
** Start whole process earlier than we did with the Gutsy forum, weeks before Gutsy release
* Underline practical, goal-oriented approach in main stickies 
* Make more people read stickies! (how?)
* Emphasize UbuntuDevelopment wiki page, and pages on Ubuntu governance
* Emphasize presence of relevant IRC channels
* No "+1"s; emphasize that this isn't a vote. Delete posts that consist of "+1".
* Emphasize that the forums aren't where development happens. Emphasize that development happens in
** Launchpad
** Mailings lists (link to lists.ubuntu.com)
** IRC 

==== Moderation ====

* Immediately close threads with ideas that can't possibly happen in any release, citing reasons in a standardized way (linking to feasibility guidelines or similar thread), and put threads with ideas that won't happen in this release to "unlikely pile" / "needs guidance pile" (like "phase out OpenOffice.org"), stating that stuff in the unlikely pile can be made more likely. State in each thread the ways of making it more likely in a standardized format.
** Clear answer to "Who decides what's unlikely?" / "Who decides what pile my thread goes into?" queries
* Make participation rules clear from the beginning: offensive, trollish, unfeasible threads will be closed, moved to $PILE, etc.
* Consult FC for authority to close anything that doesn't fit the feasibility guide criteria
** If we are to have a "rejected pile", "unlikely pile" etc., the FA team needs an escalation of power that needs to be well laid out and explained. This may not be a good idea altogether.

==== Reflections on Gutsy Procedures ====

* Teach people how to fish; the GG forum was more about giving fish.
* The "we want your ideas", "have your say" tone may be inappropriate
* The suggested spec-like structure (rationale, summary etc.) in the main sticky should be abandoned
* Review FA member/leader signatures
* We didn't prod people into writing specs enough

==== etc. ====

* Threads derive from each other and get moved between forums -- workplace thread grows from annoyance thread, etc. 
** Separate forums may bring feeling of accomplishment and reward
* Make a participation prerequisites list
* Create a clear schedule for the process, with separate phases? Discussion phase, spec writing phase, review phase, submitting phase etc.
* Keyword: "token economy" -- mm
* Determine the different types of threads in GG Idea pool (complaint, new feature request, new app request, bug fix, hardware support request, etc.)
* Based on types of threads, WRITE TASK-ORIENTED GUIDES:
** How and why to start an ubuntu derivative
** How to start a new project
** How to fix a bug yourself / get someone to fix it
** How to propose something for main / as a default
** How to get something included in Universe
* Is discussion of (changing) defaults not an "idea"? should it be carried out in the main forum? 

==== Forum Developers ====

This idea involves actually getting work done on ideas that the users are creating. One of the problems we encountered were that the users weren't doing anything themselves. Generally, the Ubuntu developers are too busy with their own stuff to spend time working on specs created by users; so not only should users create specs by themselves, they should also develop the ideas in the specs. So the basic solution is that we use developers from our own forum. There are lots of users with coding skills that often don't get used. I'm sure a lot of them would be willing to help out. The most positive part of this idea is that we have somewhat of a hold over the developers; we can decide which ideas actually have enough potential to turn into real, full specs. I think this would be a fairly good method. 

'''Procedure:'''
We could put out a call for developers in various places around the forum (I'm thinking the Cafe and the Programming Talk sections right now). If they accept to be part of the "Forum Developers" group, they would tell us what languages they're proficient in, what type of coding they have experience in, etc. If we can get a decent list of developers, I think that would be an awesome start. When a worthy idea comes up, we can put a team of 2-3 developers on it that can collaborate. Of course, this would involve writing a full spec as well as developing the code needed to fulfill the spec. 

Since the "Forum Developers" would be an actual group of people, they of course would have an environment which would facilitate their development. An IRC channel would be good, and beyond that, they can use whatever resources they feel they can utilize best (sourceforge, Google Code, etc).

Also, if we can find one, it would be great to have an Ubuntu developer (doesn't have to be a paid one) that can sort of "mentor" them. Just sort of watch over them, steer them in the right direction, tell them when they're doing something wrong, and generally, be available to answer questions. They would also play a part in advising these FD's how to eventually get their program into Ubuntu. The FA can also poke in from time to time to check up on their progress, or, if this won't be part of the FA, the FD will govern themselves.

This would end up being a bit like bounties, except much more personalized and close-knit. We would decide on the ideas that are really good, and place developers on them. This could ensure a much higher success rate, and it would most definitely ensure that more things get done. It's at least something to try.

To sum up:
* Gather as many developers as possible
* Collaborate on creating specs from ideas and actually fulfilling them. 
* Mentor-ship from Ubuntu developers could help push along the process in the right direction
* This approach would Get Things Done (tm)

Personally, I'm inclined to think that this is heading in a different direction than the FA really wants to be. The FA seems to want to take more of a passive approach; encouraging users to write specs, writing how-to's, ask users to test stuff, etc. This is much more of an active approach; it creates teams of developers who go in and do things. I believe that the FD would probably benefit most from being their own entity, but one that has close relations with the FA. That way, we can have inter-team communications, but still operate independently of each other while benefiting each other. - ManiacMusician

== To Do ==

<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/IconDevelopment.png]]</nowiki> 

* Integrate ideas from ForumAmbassadorsDiscussion.

== Comments ==
<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/IconFAQ.png]]</nowiki>

* UbuntuDemon : I don't think an entire spec is needed for this. 
* UbuntuDemon : we need a simple, concise stepwise "howto write and submit specs.
* UbuntuDemon : We can still have an idea pool but we should say something like : "discussion is nice but only discussing stuff doesn't work. You need to write a spec". Forum Ambassadors can't write specs for others. That just doesn't work because these ideas are in the heads of other people. We, forum ambassadors, can review their specs and can give them feedback on their specs before encouraging them to ask for feedback on ubuntu-devel-discuss.
* zenrox : * Consult FC for authority to close anything that doesn't fit the feasibility guide criteria
          o If we are to have a "rejected pile", "unlikely pile" etc., the FA team needs an escalation of power that needs to be well laid out and explained. This may not be a good idea altogether.
my comment on this wouldnt need a FA team  escalation have the leaders do the sorting modified by the FA member and then summited to the FA leaders
* IHMO*
