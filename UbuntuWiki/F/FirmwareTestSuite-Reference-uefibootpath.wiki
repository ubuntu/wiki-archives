=== Firmware Test Suite - uefibootpath test ===
The UEFI defined six major types of Device Path nodes. This Device Path defines how a device is attached to the resource domain of a system and used to describe the devices and the portion of a medium that is using by the booting service. The uefibootpath test checks the sanity of existing bootpath with the Device Path nodes defined on UEFI spec.

==== Examples: ====

<code>sudo fwts uefibootpath -</code>

..runs uefibootpath on your machine and dumps the output to stdout.
