== Bio ==

I'm a French/Australian Ninja who fiddles with Linux and describes himself as a goaty creature.

== Interests ==

I bounce around from distro to distro a lot but I keep coming back to Ubuntu. I'm interested in learning more about various programming languages such as Perl, Python and Mono (C#). I drink too much for a ninja.

I do a lot of community work already pushing Linux and FOSS, encouraging those who haven't yet tried it to do so. I'd like to be part of a more formal organisation in which to have the means and materials to do this, and thus I'm here.

== Contact ==

I have a blog at http://frenchninja.wordpress.com and my Last.fm is http://last.fm/user/french_ninja.
