Hi there! I'm Florencia Alvado, I prefer to say I'm a"web maker" becouse i have not enough skills to design webs, but I try. Also I teach computing to adults, and teens at schooll.
And at last I work at a University repairing and installing software, in all cases I'm trying to join people to Ubuntu, becouse it feels like freedom.
