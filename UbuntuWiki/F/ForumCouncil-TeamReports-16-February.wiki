=== An update from the Forums Council for February 2016 ===

==== Moderator Team Meetings ====

The third Moderator meeting was held on January 16th, 2016. In addition to the now usual Staff real-time gathering, two points were discussed : 

* Slow Forums access. Although some work had been done and hardware changed, we still have issues. Low access leads to pages that cannot be accessed or multiple posting in threads.
* New Ubuntu Forums Membership via Forums Contributions Guidelines which is all warm out from the oven <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Forums/Membership|here]]</nowiki>. The page was rewritten by <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/member.php?u=346442|Irihapeti]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/member.php?u=1067998|matt_symes]]</nowiki>, thanks for the hard work !

==== Spam ====

Forums spam accounts will be shared with canonical-sysadmins hoping this will help handle/reduce spam on the Ubuntu Wiki. This is a test ; if positive, hopefully an automated way to push SSO accounts ids to canonical-sysadmins will be implemented.

Should you wish to add items to the Forums Council agenda here is the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ForumCouncilAgenda|link]]</nowiki>.
