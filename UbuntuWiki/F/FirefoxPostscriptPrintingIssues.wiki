With a LaserJet 1200 on Postscript mode (which is somtimes needed for AcrobatReader to print), I had the problem that Firefox refused to print, complaining about the Postscript level installed on the printer (too old). The solution is to:

 1. Open System... Administration ... Printing
 2. Right-click on your printer's Properties...
 3. Go to Advanced...
 4. Change Ghostscript Prefiltering to '''Convert to PS level 1'''

Voila! Your Firefox will print with your printer.
