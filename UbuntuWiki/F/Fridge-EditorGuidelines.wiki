See our <nowiki>[[Fridge/Submit|Submit]]</nowiki> page for ways to submit a story to The Fridge.

==== Rough guidelines ====

The Fridge is seen as an official Ubuntu news source. All The Fridge editors are well experienced in the Ubuntu community. However, here are a few questions to ask when writing/approving a story:

* Is it in the spirit of the CoC?
* Can we be proud of the quality of the writing?
* Is the subject something the community is happy to be associated with?
* Do we believe the story to be accurate and fair?
* Does this story speak to our <nowiki>[[Fridge/Audience|target audiences]]</nowiki>?

==== Approving a story ====

# An editor enters the story into the moderation queue.
# Second editor reviews the story, checking facts and following any links.
# If the story is controversial, or technically in-depth, a third editor should check, with possible reference to #ubuntu-devel.
# Any necessary amendments are made.
# Second editor rechecks then approves the story, if appropriate.
