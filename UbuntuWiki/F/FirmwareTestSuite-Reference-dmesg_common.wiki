=== Firmware Test Suite - dmesg_common test ===

This test checks the kernel log for common firmware related error messages and warnings issued by the kernel. By default it will scan the current kernel message ring buffer, but the --klog and -k options can be used to specify
the kernel log to be scanned.

==== Examples: ====

<code>fwts dmesg_common -</code>

..runs the test on your machine and dumps the output to stdout.

<code>fwts dmesg_common --klog=/var/log/dmesg -</code>

..runs the test using /var/log/dmesg as the input and dumps the test results to stdout.

<code>fwts dmesg_common -k savedkernelmessages.log</code>

..runs the test using kernel messages from savedkernelmessages.log and appends the results to results.log
