__TOC__

The front page should obviously be more interesting than this ...

* Yes, I share the point. Actually, there's no need to use FrontPage as the first page we all see when we hit this wiki. Besides, as FrontPage is part of the /underlay dir (system pages) it is not advisable to edit it. Instead, in wikiconfig.py there's an option that lets you specify which page you wanna use for 1st page...

<pre>
page_front_page = u'UbuntuWiki' ## or whatever you like to name it
</pre>

 This way, you avoid potential conflicts when upgrading Moin versions. -- MauricioHernandez

That's good advice. 'welcome' might be a good name. Now I just need access to the filesystem ...
