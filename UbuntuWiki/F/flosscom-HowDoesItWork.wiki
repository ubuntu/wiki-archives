~+''' How does this summer university and the "Learning the Open Source Way" project work? '''+~

== Introduction ==

The "Learning the Open Source Way" project, and it's kick-off Summer University, will work by adopting the principles of open source. 

That is it will be developed by a community of 'developers' - you. 

There will be a number of different roles required. We don't want to be prescriptive about these but some suggestions are:

 1. Author - you may choose to write one of the sections we have set out.
 2. Editor - you may edit contributions from others.
 3. Advisor - you may contribute advice, say about open source practice or educational theory.
 4. Researcher - you may go off and find resources for a particular topic, such as articles, blog entries, videos or software.
 5. Developer - you may want to develop a bit of software or add in a piece that helps the course, e.g. an assessment tool.
 6. Coordinator - you might want to take an overview and help coordinate the various actions required to complete the course.

== What do I need to do? ==

First of all, you need to register with the ubuntu launchpad site, so you can edit pages. Go to url http://launchpad.net/flosscom

Once you have registered you can see the outline at url http://wiki.ubuntu.com/flosscom/

Look at the content - it is divided up in to a number of subject areas. Decide which one, or ones, you wish to contribute to, and then simply participate. This an open project, and we welcome all input. The final outcome will be the "Learning the Open Source Way" Toolkit - the aim of this is to be a guide for anyone else who wants to create or adapt a course (in any subject area) using the principles that are found in FLOSS communities.

To edit a page simply click on the edit link at the top. You can then make changes or additions to the text. Remember to save these. You will have then updated the course for everyone.

There is help on using the wiki here - HelpForBeginners

== Is there a Newbie Space? ==

If you still have doubts what this is about, or what you could do, please also have a look here at <nowiki>[[flosscom/support|Support & Contacts]]</nowiki>

== What will I get out of it? ==

There are a number of motivations for participating we believe:

 1. Experience - working on this project will give you experience that you will be unlikely to get another way. If you are an open source developer you will have the opportunity to develop educational material, and if you are an educator you will have the opportunity to experience how an open source community works, without having to become a software developer.

 2. A certificate of participation - we will provide everyone who participates with a certificate, which they can use to demonstrate their participation in this project.

 3. Status - we have devised four levels of contributor: Lecturer, Senior Lecturer, Assistant Professor and Professor. The more you contribute then the higher the status you will be awarded.

 4. A chance to attend a conference in Portugal. Ten contributors will be selected to attend an International Workshop in Portugal during summer 2008. The FLOSSCom project will cover the travel cost to Portugal, accommodation and meals. Sorry, you have to be a resident of the EU to qualify though.
