~+''' Which technology is applied in Free / Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS), and what for? '''+~

== Introduction ==

FLOSS communities use many different technologies. Consider some of the ones used here and how they support the FLOSS approach. Think about how these might be used in education.

== Forums (Fora) ==

 The basic tool used in FLOSS communities is the forums. Forums are discussion boards, used by members of the community to communicate with each other in an asynchronous way, leaving messages everyone can see and answer. This way people can ask their questions about the project, make propositions for additions or changes to the project etc. Such discussion boards can be easily applied in education. The teacher can create a forum through which students can make contact, or ask questions about the class they're taking. Also this can be extended to a basic teaching utility, since there's the option to post assignments or even whole lessons to the board! 

== Wikis ==

Wiki's can be used for collaboration. 

== Fancy a survey on tools in FLOSS? ==

Please feel also invited to participate at our survey on FLOSS tools and how they are related to learning. Just follow <nowiki>[[http://iberscience.de/survey/index.php?sid=1|this link]]</nowiki> to take it.
