__TOC__

Flow is an application indicator using the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/zeitgeist|Zeitgeist engine]]</nowiki>. It brings contextual relevancy to the desktop, with a quick way to access related information and activities to the current one. It can be seen as a simple reminder or as a new way of interacting with documents, websites or even IM contacts , providing the feeling that all these items are connected to each others. Proposing this tool is assuming that what can be seen as a single activity by the user (eg. editing a file) is the fruit of many, as it provides this information to the user.

For short, it provides what the user is probably needing to accomplish his current task, based on his previous actions during this particular task.

''Definition : Is considered as "activity" or "task", almost everything Zeitgeist can track : webpages, opened/played files and IM conversations.''

=== Rationale ===

The Flow menu provides a quick access to activites related to your current one in a simple and unobstrusive way. If clicked when no activity has focus on, it presents the most used activities on your computer during the last x days. When an activity is focused, it presents the most used activities with this one.
