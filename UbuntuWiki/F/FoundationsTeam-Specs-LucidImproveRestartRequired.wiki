=== Summary ===

The current auto-open behavior of the restart required dialog is a bad user experience. It pops up out of the blue without much releation to the running upgrade.

=== Release Note ===

For system upgrade like the kernel that require a restart the user is notified in a clean way at the end of the upgrade that a restart of his system is suggested.

=== Rationale ===

The restart required dialog should be in direct relation to the upgrade that was performed to not confuse the user.

=== User stories ===

Joe runs update-manager and gets  a new kernel. After the upgrade process he is presented with a nice option to restart. He chooses to do so.

=== Design ===

==== Removing a separate alert that suddenly pops up ====

* Integrate the alert into the Update Manager window (and discuss with the design team how it should look like)
* remove the restart required auto opening from update-notifier

==== Using the session menu as an extra indication ====

* Change the power indicator to an alert state (the artists will provide icon)
* change text of "Restart ..." to "Restart required ..." and possibly highlight this item

=== Implementation ===

See work items in the blueprint.

==== Code Changes ====

Update-notifier, update-manager and session-indicator needs to be updated to implement the new behavior. 

=== Test/Demo Plan ===

To test this functionality install a new kernel update via update-manager and check that the notification is show by update-manager itself. Verify also that the session indicator changes color.
