__TOC__

Ubuntu uses hotplug and udev to manage module loading and device node creation.  While this configuration works quite well overall, there are a few rough edges which need to be smoothed.

* Some IDE modules are not automatically loaded: see https://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/1763
* The sg module, needed for CD (but not DVD) writing, is not automatically loaded when an appropriate device is attached

These problems should be solved in a way which is considered appropriate by the kernel development community, so as to be maintainable in the future.  It is possible that these problems will be solved entirely in userspace, but it is also possible that kernel changes will be required.
