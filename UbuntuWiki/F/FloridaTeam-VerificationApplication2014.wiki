=== Roadmap ===

==== Governance ====
** '''Team Council''' - We recently changed out governance structure to spread leadership responsibilities over a three-member council of elected members. We will continue the transition to this new structure, with the council assuming more proactive and promotional roles.

==== Events ====
** '''FOSSETCON/UbuCon''' - The Florida team will be helping to organize and run UbuCon on the first day for FOSSETCON, and assisting the event organizers with setup, advocacy, and anything else we can do
** '''Release Parties''' - We had a great release party for Trusty Tahr, and plan to have at least one party per release, hopefully expanding it back to multiple locations throughout the state.

==== Meetings ====
** '''Team Meetings''' - Continue to have regular IRC meetings and get back into the habit of having one very month
** '''App Dev Training''' - We would like to organize and run some online application development training programs for the team

=== Experience ===
