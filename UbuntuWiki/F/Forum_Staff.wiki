=== What We Do ===

The <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org|Ubuntu Forums]]</nowiki> are moderated by a team of volunteers, often referred to as staff.  They have two rolls: Moderators and Administrators.  The Moderators primary role is to respond to reports created by forum members, enforce the <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/index.php?page=policy| forum code of conduct]]</nowiki> and perform general thread maintenance.  The Administrators primary role is dispute resolution between forum members and the moderators.  The Administrators also deal with the more technical issues behind the scenes of the forum.

This page is primarily an index of the moderation team, as well as some more human information about them :)

I also get involved with testing Ubuntu Development Releases from time to time. <<BR>> <<BR>> I have run various gnu/linux operating systems over the years including Fedora, Crunchbang Linux, Zenix, Arch Linux, Debian, Sn0wl1nux and elementaryOS. I would consider my exposure to other operating systems quite broad. <<BR>> <<BR>>I help keep the forums running smoothly in my administrator capacity, mainly dealing with spam, thread maintenance and trouble makers. Additionaly as a member of the Forum Council I have the ability to grant Ubuntu Membership to community members who have made sustained contributions on the forum. I'm also the chair on the Council and can make a passing vote as and where needed (not that I really use this power).

| <|8 style="text-align: justify;"> I first started using Linux, shortly after Windows 98 was released, as I didn't like the direction Windows was heading. My first distribution was RedHat 5.2 desktop version. It took me 3 or 4 tries before I got a fully working desktop, and since then I haven't looked back. I currently run Raring Ringtail (13.04) on my main system, that is also my main day to day system. <<BR>><<BR>>I initially heard about Ubuntu on http://slashdot.org, I sent an email off and a couple of weeks later a received 10 Warty Warthog CD's in the mail, which at the time, I couldn't get to work on my hardware. I eventually gave Ubuntu another try shortly before 6.06 was released, and have been using it ever since. <<BR>><<BR>>I also help keep the Forums running smoothly as well as being a member of the Forum Council. Strangely enough one of my favourite jobs is being the Forum contact person

Currently I work providing support on and moderating the various social media profiles of a large company. My job and my role on Ubuntu forums are unrelated though. In the past I have been a fish wholesaler. I am particulary interested in music of all kinds and can hold down a decent tune on the mandolin (my tremolo needs some work).   <<BR>> <<BR>> My role on the forums usually involves responding to reported posts and getting rid of spam. I often move posts in the General Help and Absolute Beginners Section, that have not received a reply in over 24 hours, to a more specific forum which bumps them to the top and hopefully gets an answer. It is also usually me who closes Testimonials after one week. I like to encourage forum members to apply for Ubuntu Membership, some of these poor souls have ended up on the moderation team themselves. If I am online you can find me in the #ubuntuforums irc channel.

| <|7 style="text-align: justify;"> I personally owe a great deal of graitiude to Ubuntu as it was the operating system that got me interested in computers again. <<BR>> <<BR>> I have spent most of my career writing software for a well known, propietary operating system. I found that after using this operating system, both at work and at home, i was beginning to lose interest in computers, programming and technology in general. That all changed after i started using Ubuntu. At first i used it in a VM but after an accident with my hard drive i started using it full time. I have found it easy and intuitive to use. If you like to look deeper, it allows you to look under the bonnet of an operating system. If I am online you can find me in the #ubuntuforums irc channel.<<BR>><<BR>>

| <|7 style="text-align: justify;"> I've used UNIX since 1978 when I worked at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Several years after I left NASA, the jobs I had were Microsoft centric. Recently (past 7 years), I was hearing about emerging technology; such as, virtualization, software/infrastructure as a service, and so forth. I did a little research and found the FOSS projects. FOSS allowed me to experiment with virtualization, cloud, big data, etc. That enabled me to further my knowledge and career opportunities. Linux is so similar to UNIX that I was able to adapt to it easily. As an engineer I have to continuously learn, and FOSS has been very beneficial in that arena. My activity on the Ubuntu Forums is my way of giving back to the community that has helped me in my self-education and employment opportunities.   <<BR>> <<BR>> My role on the forums mainly involves responding to reported posts, jailing spam (unfortunately a necessary Staff activity), moving posts to sections of the forum where they may get a prompt/relevant reply, and doing the things I would normally do if I were not Staff.

| <|8 style="text-align: justify;"> I became involved with computers in 1989 when a neighbour gave me his broken computer (iirc, an IBM PS/2).  I took the whole thing apart, right down to its bare components, put it back together and it worked. Thus, a passion was born. I was determined to learn as much about its inner workings as possible. A decade later I changed careers and entered the IT field just in time for Y2K. I've worked on a help desk, in desktop support, as a server and network administrator, as an IT support supervisor, an enterprise architecture analyst and have slowly made my way up the "corporate" ladder. I am currently employed as a senior systems integrator/software project manager for a large municipal organization.  <<BR>><<BR>>My experimentation and involvement with Linux began in the early 90s with Slackware and I quickly found a home with Redhat. I experimented with many other distros and operating systems and eventually found my way to Ubuntu around 2005. I currently run OpenBSD on my home server (firewall, router, dns, dhcp, www, ftp, etc) and Xubuntu on my notebooks. OpenBSD for security, Xubuntu for productivity, and Xubuntu+1 to see whats coming down the pipeline.  <<BR>><<BR>>And yes, as you can tell from my avatar, I'm an avid runner.<<BR>><<BR>><<BR>><<BR>>
