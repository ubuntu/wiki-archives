__TOC__

These are the things that we would like Launchpad to be able to do to help with DailyBuilds.

More specific requirements can be given as needed.

=== Daily Builds ===

We would like to be able to do daily builds entirely from within LP. Conversations at
UDS lead me to believe the roadmap would look something like:

** build-from-branch: make PPA builders able to do more than just go source->binary, and be able to go branch->source. This is useful for other things, but the infrastructure work goes a long way towards:
** build-from-recipe: take a "recipe" that describes a daily build and turn it in to a source package. lp:bzr-builder can be used to do this. Similar to build-from-branch, but uses multiple branches.
** Entering recipes: either with a webeditor, or uploading files or similar.
** Daily builds: "cron"-like scheduling of builds, with options to not build if nothing changed.

=== Bugs on PPAs ===

We need to be able to do something useful with bugs from daily builds, specifically with apport reports. This could take several forms:

Either all PPAs become bug targets, or PPAs can have a bug target associated with them, so that you can point to a project bug tracker for all bugs from a PPA. Official PPAs for project probably tie in here some way.

Ideally we would like the information about the target to be available offline. Packages files use a "Bugs:" field that we could use, which would specify the +filebug location for the bug target.

We could then make apport respect this fairly easily, and then relax the checks on whether a package comes from the distro, making PPAs much more pleasant to use for testers and potentially more useful to developers.

=== Debug builds ===

We would also want to have debugging symbols available for apport to retrace, which may require some LP changes. This part of the spec isn't properly thought out yet, as we may prefer to not strip the builds and generate a full backtrace locally, rather than run the retracers against every LP bug target. However, I hear that ddebs may be becoming part of LP soon, so I wanted to add this to the list.
