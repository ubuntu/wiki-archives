=== Lightning Round ===

==== Scott James Remnant ====

Battling with the kernel VT layer, Plymouth has swapped sides at least twice but I think it's on our side now and we're winning.
It's truly amazing the number of invalid states you can put the kernel in

==== Gary Lasker ====

Back/forward navigation history feature for Software Center is landed, woo!
Refactored PPAs/channel view code, it's cleaner and much easier to use.
Added partner channel support in channel views.
Fixed lots of bugs this week, emphasis on bugfixes needed before UI freeze.

==== Evan Dandrea ====

fixing language page when in oem-config mode, moving intro page contents into the language page (and making translatable), fixing a bug in usb-creator thats breaking bootloader installation, hunting down a bug in the slideshow/webkit (hitting a security check in the latest webkit), removing the partition page progress dialogs per discussion in 336751, adding a progress message for wiping swap in the installer when using encrypted home
blocked on legal for the restricted-extras page.

==== Michael Vogt ====

worked on software-center (plus django rnr-server), update-manager and upgrade testing, some a3 data updates (like command-not-found, app-install-data)
 
==== James Westby ====

Tackling bzr-builddeb and import failures, and working with LP on building from branches directly. Going to be working on getting all my code in Ubuntu ready for release.

==== Steve Langasek ====

following through on the team merge for ubuntu-release and motu-release this week
opportunistically converting the Debian Samba team to be bzr fans
working on getting casper to talk to plymouth

==== Colin Watson ====

done: landed rest of foundations-lucid-gfxboot-update; landed parted 2.1; playing with 3.0 (quilt) source format, mostly liking it; made grub-probe filesystem queries about 10 times faster
blocked: nothing
todo: take advantage of parted 2.1 to set up proper partition alignment; get back to beating on the kernel for console-setup/upstart

==== Barry Warsaw ====

Returned from Pycon on Friday.  Worked on Ratings and Reviews server; soon to have another branch for merging.  Completed second and third drafts of PEP 3147 (PYC Repository Directories); probably ready for BDFL pronouncement and implementation.  Released Python 2.6.5rc1.  Not blocked.

=== Outstanding actions from last meeting ===

None.

=== Feature freeze exceptions ===

Notes from previous weeks:
* UbuntuSpec:foundations-lucid-software-raid-in-ubiquity-for-desktop-install - medium priority, running out of time, may need to defer
* UbuntuSpec:foundations-lucid-btrfs-support - low priority, expecting to defer
* UbuntuSpec:foundations-lucid-jockey-support-in-ubiquity - medium priority, expecting to defer
* UbuntuSpec:foundations-lucid-software-center-repository-based-index - may not make it, in which case we'll need a client-side workaround, or external PPAs won't get to benefit from icons
* UbuntuSpec:foundations-lucid-distributed-development - various useful bzr features won't land in the next week, but perhaps not for lucid anyway
* <james_w> I'll probably realise that were are in dire need of a new bzr-builddeb feature in about 24 hours :-)
* <ev> I might need some for things design want, but nothing specific yet
* <Keybuk> I may end up with a couple of small ones for extra tenths of second
* <tremolux> one small feature, back/forward navigation: UbuntuSpec:foundations-lucid-software-center-ui-improvements
* <ev> I may have one, for adding functionality to the installer to download and install ubuntu-restricted-extras (including running the decss script), as mentioned in the lightning round
* <james_w> I probably have minor one for bzr-builddeb for something that is probably a feature, even though it fixes a bug :-)

This week:
* <mvo> I will add one for the new python-apt and for ratings&reviews
* <cjwatson> both of my freeze exceptions from last week are done
* <cjwatson> I actually want to upgrade to parted 2.2, but I think that's essentially a bug-fix release - the only "new feature" in NEWS is more appropriately classified as a bug fix IMO :-)
* <cjwatson> (sane default alignment instead of NULL when disk topology info is incomplete)

=== Chair for next meeting ===

* Barry Warsaw

=== Activity reports ===

==== Scott James Remnant ====

* In bed with Flu monday/tuesday :-(
* Fixed the rsyslog 100% CPU issue; due to the design of rsyslogd it wasn't possible to have it refuse to drop permissions, instead I had to make it disable the klog plugin if a zero-byte read() returned -EPERM
* Patched Upstart to mount /proc and /sys itself on boot, solving all the annoying issues where things like mountall and ureadahead need it
* usb-modeswitch discussion
* Helping OEM team out with issues related to Plymouth
* Been working on Plymouth's VT issues, and trying to understand the complex interplay between the X server and Plymouth (which both use KD_GRAPHICS and VT_PROCESS).  I understand now, and it's a SMOP (which I'm going to have to do)

==== Evan Dandrea ====

* Short week; travel on Monday and Tuesday morning from Pycon.
* Fixed LP: #527932, #524827, #526581, and some more ubiquity bugs.
* More work on new installer design automatic partitioner widgets.
* Moved the slideshow translation code to po4a as html2po is no longer provided in Debian.
* Changed the packaging of the slideshow so that each installer slideshow package provides ubiquity-slideshow and also conflicts and replaces on it, allowing only one installer slideshow package installed at once.  Moved all slideshow files to /usr/share/ubiquity-slideshow and updated ubiquity to reflect this. This allows derivatives to create their own slideshows without us having to hard code their paths in ubiquity.
* Updated slideshow translations, pruned a suspicious URL (LP: #528465), released a new slideshow package, and updated all interested parties on the aforementioned changes.

==== Colin Watson ====

* Another fix for gfxboot handling of Hebrew (#212491).
* foundations-lucid-gfxboot-update:
** Merged Cody's language selector for ubiquity-greeter-gtk, and dealt with integration.
* Switched to automatic LP git import of packages-arch-specific.
* Did most of the migration to parted 2.1.  One or two pieces remain.
* Fixed up grub2 integration in memtest86+ (#435153).
* Fixed desktop icon handling in example-content (#458250).
* Tackled most of #526422 ("Grub installer asks too many questions to the user", actually a messy image assembly problem).
* Tried to stop update-notifier from popping up during the live session.  I think I mostly managed it, although Dave Morley still reports some problems.
* Fixed corrupted text display in d-i (#526391).
* Various other bits of installer bug firefighting for alpha-3, e.g. migration-assistant ordering (#524993), a regression from the plugin migration (#524169), a crash on non-resizable partitions (#527057), and some KDE frontend fixes (#527457, #527468).
* TB meeting.
* Merged: debhelper

==== James Westby ====

===== Distributed Development =====

* More debugging of failures from the importer. Lots more packages that people care about are now imported.
* Fixed a couple of bugs in bzr-builddeb.
* Wrote some specs for LP developers to review concerning bzr-builder recipes that will allow them to implement something good based on them in LP. Positive feedback on my first drafts from them.

==== Barry Warsaw ====

This week, after returning from Pycon, I worked on the ratings and reviews Django server for Software Center.

I also released Python 2.6.5rc1, with a final release slated for March 15.
