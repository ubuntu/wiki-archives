== Florida Linux Show ==

During our November 18th Meeting we all discussed the possibility's of going to this Linux Event and providing support for installation or other areas where they may need volunteers. My ideas were to try and get either some shirts made or some buttons at least that can help promote our LOCO and if enough of us go, It would be great marketing and possibly even recruiting effort on our parts.

=== About the Show ===

This info comes directly from the site itself <nowiki>[[http://www.floridalinuxshow.com/index.php?pr=About]]</nowiki>
 
The Florida Linux Show 2008 is specifically for the 2nd largest number of Linux SIGs in the United States.  Since Florida has a large number of national ISPs, Fortune 1000 companies, and a large Internet and technology presence in the United States Linux community, it is only fitting that this state has its own Linux Conference to serve this unique group of information technology professionals.
The Florida Linux Show 2008 allows Linux administrator, users, and the open source community, along with other commercial technology stakeholders to meet and exchange information about needed technology skills, current and future job or project opportunities, new and evolving technologies, trends and qualifying market directions, and the Internet infrastructure that affects all users and hardware and software administrators, to include, ISPs, state and local government entities, large, medium, and small businesses, and non-profit groups and associations.
The Florida Linux Show 2008 is both an exhibition and a conference to serve the needs of the Florida Linux Community and associated integrated technology developers and users. 

A portion of the show also welcomes the Windows user community to share ideas and information that help each part of the Information Technology industry to meet and network (no pun intended) with each other.

=== Volunteers ===

As a volunteer with the Florida Linux Show 2008 you will receive the following for your volunteer contribution to the show:

Free entry into the Florida Linux Show 2008.
Free Florida Linux Show 2008 T-Shirt.

I plan on driving down the evening before, and staying in a hotel that is pretty close to the conference center.  <nowiki>[[http://64.233.169.104/u/unfl?q=cache:uxUkaORBd0IJ:www.unf.edu/dept/purchasing/docs/Preferred_hotels_list.pdf+hotel&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=2&gl=us&ie=UTF-8|Here]]</nowiki> is a list of nearby hotels.  Be sure to ask for the UNF preferred rate.
