This year, in honor of the Loco's 'birthday' (the day we were officially recognized as an Ubuntu Loco ) and the Karmic Koala Release - we're having a BBQ!

Here's the deal.  We're hosting it at Mike & Michelle Hall's house, in their backyard,  and at the same time conducting a packing jam.  There'll be food, there'll be fun, there'll be wifi.  Mike and Michelle are providing meat, sides, etc., but would appreciate any volunteers to bring dishes.  They'll be smoking more meat than is healthy, but that's the fun part of a BBQ.

Please, RSVP if you're planning to attend, and if you can bring a covered dish.

Location:
Lakeland, FL

Time:  Noon until everyone goes home or passes out.

Other pertinent info:
Bring your appetite.  Leave the diet at the door.  Kids are welcome, there'll be plenty for them to do, as well.  Bring your friends and family, everyone's welcome! (Just let us know how many...)
