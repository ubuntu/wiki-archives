__TOC__

The Ubuntu Kylin team is delighted to announce an Ubuntu Testing Week from April 2nd to April 8th with other flavors in the Ubuntu family.

April 2nd is the beta release of what will become Ubuntu Kylin 20.04, and during this week, there will be a freeze on changes to features, the user interface and documentation. Between April 2nd and final release on April 23rd, the Ubuntu Kylin team and community will focus on ISO testing, bug reporting, and fixing bugs. Please join the community by downloading the daily ISO image and trying it out, even beginning today.

Getting Help or Discussing

Chat live on IRC ( https://webchat.freenode.net/#ubuntu-quality?nick=ubuntuk-tester?w  ) or telegram ( https://t.me/UbuntuTesters  ).

Test Targets

If you have no spare computer to use for testing, no problem! You can test without changing your system by running it in a VM (Virtual Machine) with software like Virtualbox or running it in the live session from a USB or DVD, so you can also test if your hardware works correctly. We encourage those that are willing, installing it on physical hardware–requires at least 20GB of hard disk space–and use it continuously for a few days, as more bugs can be exposed and reported this way.

Reporting Bugs

The easy way to report a bug is to open up terminal and then typing:

$ ubuntu-bug packagename

The packagename is the ubuntu package the program or application where you experience the bug is packaged in.

Using ubuntu-bug will automatically upload logs and other files to Launchpad that developers need to fix the bug.

Applications

Please test programs or /applications that you regularly use, so you can identify bugs and regressions that should be reported.

ISOs

New ISO files are built every day; always test with the most up-to-date ISO.

Zsync downloads only changes, so it’s swift.

$ zsync http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntukylin/daily-live/current/focal-desktop-amd64.iso.zsync

Note - You may need to install Zsync. The can be done in the terminal with `sudo apt install zsync`.

Thank You!

We all thank you for any help and testing provided as we all march towards a solid release.
