__TOC__

=== Note ===
This is a check done against Kubuntu Breezy Badger

* Contact: <nowiki>[[FlorianEhrenthal]]</nowiki>
* Make: Apple
* Brand: Powerbook
* Model: G4, 1.5 GHz, post february 2005
* Website: http://www.apple.com/

=== '''W A R N I N G''' ===
* I noticed that the '''system-fan doesn't work correctly''' to cool your powerbook!!
 If you don't control the temperature yourself (and power-down ubuntu) you will probably kill your beloved Powerbook! Be warned!

=== Current Issues ===
* Bootsplash colors are distorted (maybe inverted?)
* CPU does only at 700MHz
* Cannot increase/decrease LCD Backlight with Fn-F1/2
