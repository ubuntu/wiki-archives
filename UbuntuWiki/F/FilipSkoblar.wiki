__TOC__

My name is Filip Skoblar. I'm 24 year old student of economics on University of Economics in Zagreb.
Areas of interest are : To familiarize people with the 'wonders' of open source. Extend my knowledge and help people in need of a quick advice. Popularize Ubuntu, representing it as a valuable alternative.                       
Currently, i'm researching hardware support and obstacles regarding the same in Ubuntu. In my opinion, it is one of the major obstacles in spreading this exciting OS.
