* April 6th Meeting, we decided officially to merge back to only the standards lists.ubuntu.com mailing list. For several years now we have been using both Launchpad ML and the Standard List. So far we have set the Standard List as default, and mailed the team asking those that are on the LP ML only to move themselves over to the Standard List. June 1st is the target date, and after that the ML admin/moderator will move the rest over manually. 

* April 20th, Announced the Lucid Release Party, which was hosted at the Pizza Gallery Viera/Melbourne Area. Discussed adding events to the LoCo Directory, which is an amazing resource for LoCo Teams. http://loco.ubuntu.com

The Lucid Release Party for Viera/Melbourne Area took place on the evening of the 29th in the Avenues Plaza Viera. Pizza Gallery was a dynamite place to hold this. We had 12 attendees, and everyone had a great time. 1 upgrade and 2 installs were performed. We discussed the changes found within Lucid. Everyone was commenting on the peppiness of Lucid, and really enjoyed the new release! Thanks to all the developers and contributors for all of your hard work!!
