== why ubuntu ? ==

since 2002 i'm engaged in linux. The first steps i made with suse-linux, followed by knoppix and debian. 
Debian is a really great distri, but in my linux-seminars i was often asked which distribution i would prefer for an linux beginner, and then my usual answer was ubuntu.

So, if i suggest everybody to work with ubuntu, why schouldn't i do so?

But what is really special in ubuntu?

Some years ago i saw mark shuttleworth in frankfurt at the linux world expo, and i asked myself, what should be the reason for an other debian based distribution. No question, marc's demo was great, but would the community accept another ditri? 

Two years later i saw mark again in wiesbaden at the linux-day, and there was no question at all, the community has accepted ubuntu, because ubuntu is a linux for "normal" users.

== my interests ... ==

I'm interested in open source software, specialy linux. My point of view matches with the ubuntu-ideals of free souftware. 

I'm also interested in writing ruby on rails applications. If you want to see more, you can visit my german homepage at <nowiki>[[www.rothmann-net.de]]</nowiki>.
