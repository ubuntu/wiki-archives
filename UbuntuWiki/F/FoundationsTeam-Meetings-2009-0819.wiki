=== Activity reports ===

==== Colin Watson ====
* On Holiday
==== Evan Dandrea ====
* Short week, vacation on Friday.
* More work on migration-assistant for Windows.  Hopeful to have it functionally on par with the original version soon.
* Lots of work on encrypted swap in support of encrypted home directories.  Working version is now in the archive and just waiting for a new livefs build so we can ask the security team to evaluate encrypted home directories again.
* Work on the cleanup branch of usb-creator, getting it ready for a release with the devicekit backend.
* Uploaded a ubiquity-slideshow-ubuntu with a fixed copyright that was new'ed, and filled out a MIR for it.  Once that's approved and the seeds are changed, the specification should be complete as ubiquity will already automatically start using it once the slides are on the live CD filesystem.
==== James Westby ====

==== Lars Wirzenius ====
* Made an outline for my GTD tutorial for Ubuntu Developer Week.
* Switched back from Firefox to Epiphany, after nuking all Epiphany settings.
* Further Computer Janitor UI work.
* http://blog.liw.fi/posts/pygtk-automatic-connects/
* A number of bug fixes to Computer Janitor, and processed almost all other bugs.
* Dropped the "unsupported package" plugin from Computer Janitor's default installation, for now.
* Noticed that the bug fix for python-fstab that was supposed to have been uploaded for jaunty wasn't. Oops.
* Discussed with Michael Vogt using zsync for Packages files, and debdelta for .debs. He'd like zsync to use libcurl. debdelta needs more experimentation by me before further discussion with Michael.
* Suggested to Michael apt might drop its getaddrinfo emulation layer.
* Converted Computer Janitor packaging to use dh from debhelper 7.
* Computer Janitor is now at https://launchpad.net/computer-janitor with branches at lp:computer-janitor and lp:computer-janitor/trunk.deb-packaging
* Likewise, python-fstab is now at https://launchpad.net/python-fstab with branches at lp:python-fstab and lp:python-fstab/trunk.deb-packaging
