== Gutsy Release Party ==
 
We are looking for places we can hold this meeting and ideas. Gutsy will be released on a Thursday, so there may be some debate on which day to meet up. Jono has set up a few resources for the LoCos already. Take a look at the following:

<nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BuildingCommunity/RunningReleaseParty|RunningReleaseParty]]</nowiki><<BR>><nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/GutsyReleaseParties|GutsyReleaseParties]]</nowiki>

=== Who & Where ===

It doesn't matter where you are located, we can figure out the location(s) once we know who is going to attend. Another option may be to hold multiple locations for the release <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=568970|Gusty Relase Party Locations Poll]]</nowiki>.  At the moment the locations follow are Orlando, Gainesville, Cocoa Area, South Florida and Tallahassee. 

If you want to be there, just RSVP for the party location of your choice.

=== Where (Place) & When ===

Suggestions are needed here. If you have an idea for a place add your suggestions below.

The time will need to be hammered out once the location is set in stone.

=== What ===

At the release party, what do you guys want to do... One suggestion was to simply discuss some of the new features in Gutsy or highlight some of the new applications. Food, drink, and conversations will be considered mandatory. In all, it will be a good time to kick back and relax.  This will be a great time for us to all meet up and get to know one another.

<nowiki>[[File:ubun3100x100.png]]</nowiki>  

The details of the Gutsy Release Party Orlando are now final as of the team meeting on October 14 2007. <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/pak33m|pak33m]]</nowiki>

'''Date''': October 18, 2007

'''Time''': 7 PM EST

'''Where''': Panera 8600 Vineland Ave Orlando, FL 32821 Lake Buena Vista right next to Dixie Stampede 

'''What''': Meet n' Greet n' Eat, Discuss new features of Gutsy and GNOME and install Gutsy

'''What to bring''': It's really up to all of you... Some suggestions I would make are:
CD-r's in case you want to make a copy of any software. External USB Drives (same reason if you prefer to just dd a copy for yourself), Powerstrips (don't forget your Power Supplies ;-), Wireless/USB Mouse, Headsets for testing sound, Money for Food and Drinks! I plan on bringing a camera, mylaptop w/ p.s., and some extra cd-r's in case anyone needs any! - itnet7

'''Team Contact''': <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/pak33m|pak33m]]</nowiki>

This will be the first release party for the team and may be a smaller event, but certainly should be a good time overall.  I <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/pak33m|pak33m]]</nowiki> will get there as early as possible to get a place to accomodate us all.  Bring and share whatever you would like.  If you plan to attend please RSVP below.

This is only one of a few parties that we are planning.  I wanted to get this party together for people that could make it on the day of the release.
