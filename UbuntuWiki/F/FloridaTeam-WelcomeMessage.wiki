Welcome [user_name] and thank you for joining the Ubuntu Florida LoCo;  we appreciate your interest!  There are many things available through the Florida team.  Below is a list of all the resources in which you may be interested.

*** The Wiki (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FloridaTeam).  You can edit any page here.  This serves as a base of information about our LoCo.
*** The Launchpad.  You have already signed up here, that's how you got this E-Mail.
*** The mailing list.  Go to https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-us-fl to sign up for our mailing list.  This is the primary way we communicate.
*** The forum (http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=225).  We have a subforum on Ubuntu Forums.  This is another means of communication.
*** The IRC channel (#ubuntu-us-fl on irc.ubuntu.com).  Ubuntu Florida members are usually idling here.  Additionally, we hold 8:00 PM EDT meetings on the 1st and 3rd Sunday of every month.

Again, thank you for your contribution and we hope you enjoy our stay.
