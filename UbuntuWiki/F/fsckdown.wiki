'''Please Note: -''' fsckdown has been generally superseded by AutoFsck.

fsckdown is a script which, when run, uses fsck to scan your hard drive partitions and then turn off your computer.  The advantage of checking your partitions this way is that, assuming you do it regularly, you won't run into the automated check which runs at boot time.

==== Download: ====
fsckdown was created specifically for Ubuntu 6.06 and 6.10, it is likely to work on other versions, and may even work on other Debian/Gnome distributions.

Download <nowiki>[[attachment:fsckdown.tar.bz2]]</nowiki>

==== Installation: ====
fsckdown comes packaged in an archive, to set it up, extract the archive and double click the 'install' file, when the following message appears, click on 'Run' then follow the on screen instructions.

==== Use: ====
To use fsckdown, simply go to the 'System' menu, then 'Administration', and finally click on 'Check Disks and Halt'.  Firstly you will be asked to confirm that you want to run fsckdown, then you will be asked if you want your computer to power down when the check is completed, finally you will be asked for your password in order to continue.

==== Further Information: ====
A lot of people have been concerned that the automatic (every 30 mounts) boot up disk check may by chance run when the need their computer quickly, especially if it's a laptop.  If you know that you're going to need your laptop to boot quickly next time (because you're giving a presentation for example, issue the following command to ensure the check doesn't happen:

<code>sudo touch /fastboot</code>

'''Note''' that this only prevents the check for the very next boot.
