__TOC__

Here's some information I hope will help with my application to the UbuntuQA team.

=== Useful links when applying to QA / helping with bugs ===
* Most importantly: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bugs/HowToTriage
* <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bugs?advanced=1|Using the advanced bug reports search]]</nowiki>, choose unconfirmed, undecided importance bugs to practice triaging
* Check https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MOTU/SRU, http://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityUpdateProcedures to be able to explain why certain updates can't be incorporated to Ubuntu right away
* Also check https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MOTU/School/BugWork for some great hints/examples
