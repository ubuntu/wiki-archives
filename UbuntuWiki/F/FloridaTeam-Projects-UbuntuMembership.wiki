__TOC__

This page tracks and details a LoCo-centric effort for preparing those active in the LoCo to become full Ubuntu Members.

==== Goals ====

# Increase membership / participation in both Ubuntu and the LoCo.
# Work with those interested in membership to discover their talents / interests and how those can be applied to Ubuntu? ( The "How can I contribute?" question )
  a. This should probably include a dabbling in as many aspects as possible, to see what sticks. It's probably unrealistic to assume prospective members will have a grasp on how their talents will match up with the needs of the Ubuntu community.

==== Overview ====

Hybrid Mentor / Course Layout, with prospective members being both assigned a mentor ( who can answer questions, provide guidance, etc. ) and expected to attend periodic scheduled training sessions.
