=== LoCo Website ===

** <nowiki>[[DanTrevino]]</nowiki> made the suggestion after setting up http://loco-dev.ubuntu-fl.org, that the team stick with Joomla or test Wordpress functionality
                    to see if it meets the teams need in an easier fashion. Most were in agreement, <nowiki>[[itnet7]]</nowiki> mentioned that he would test out to see
                    drupals LP integration to see if that might be the only compelling reason to implement the site on Drupal.  

** We decided to continue looking at Wordpress's strength and test Drupal's LP integration to see if it is worthwhile and discuss this next meeting.

==== Case Badges for Locos ====

*** <nowiki>[[MartinOwens]]</nowiki> has mailed the loco-list to let teams know that he is planning on making another run at the case badges. <nowiki>[[DanTrevino]]</nowiki> brought up
                   the idea that we could as a team invest in some of these badges for give aways at conferences, meetups (possibly), etc. A wiki page 
                   for sponsorship, <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FloridaTeam/CaseBadgeOrder| Case Badge Order Link]]</nowiki> was created by <nowiki>[[itnet7]]</nowiki>. Initial buy in
                   is set at $23 dollars a person. Nothing is Mandatory. After we see that enough people commit for sponsorship <nowiki>[[itnet7]]</nowiki> will contact
                   <nowiki>[[MartinOwens|DoctorMo]]</nowiki> to find out about payment options and ordering time frames.
