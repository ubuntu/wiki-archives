~+'''Certificate Design Contest'''+~

== About ==

All those of you who participate at this Virtual & On-Campus Summer University will receive an e-certificate in the name of all FLOSSCom project partners of having participated in the project.
We would like to make this certificate as meaningful as possible so it adds a value to your CV.
For this reason we decided to launch a certificate design contest. We developed a draft certificate that can be found below. This should serve as a starting point for you and guide you in your ideas. In the case you feel that you could do better, just go ahead and come up with an alternative solution. By the end of this summer university we will ask the community to decide on the most appealing and valuable certificate.
