=== About Me ===
Hi there! My name is <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~fedevera|Fido]]</nowiki>  although some people call me Federico Vera, I'm a Biomedical Engineering student at the National University of Córdoba (Argentina)

=== Unix Like OSs and me ===
I started with Unix like OSs when I was 12 (with a non open source distribution; "SUSE 4.SOMETHING"), then I moved to Debian and even though I tried a LOT of distros in my short life I met my all time favorite (Ubuntu of course!) in 2006.

=== What do I do in my spare time ===
I'm a C++ coder although most of my work is in (Java, AJAX and Python), and I'm the maintainer of <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/pictogame|Pictogame]]</nowiki>.

=== Ubuntu Contribution ===
I have reported a few bugs and help solve some, provided a lot of translations specially to <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/ailurus|Ailurus]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/scilab|SciLab]]</nowiki>, I try my best providing feedback through the <nowiki>[[http://qa.ubuntu.com/|Ubuntu QA Program]]</nowiki>, and I managed to ''convert'' quite a few people to the Ubuntu Universe.

=== I would like to ===
Help the Ubuntu and Open Source community in general, improve my skills as a coder in order to find '''''the ultimate question'''''.
