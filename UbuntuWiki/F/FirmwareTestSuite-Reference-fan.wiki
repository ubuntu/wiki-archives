This test simple looks for the existence of fan devices and with version V0.23.19 also exercises the CPU and
checks to see if any fan status has changed.

==== Examples: ====

<code>fwts fan -</code>

..runs the fan test on your machine and dumps the output to stdout.

=== Explanation of test results ===

Certain test results may require a little more explanation. This section will try and give some context to specific test failures.
