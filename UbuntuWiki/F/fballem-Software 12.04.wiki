__TOC__

This page describes methods for installing specific Software in the current 64-bit Long-Term Support edition of ubuntu, including adding specific repositories and commands. The current version is 12.04.3

Some of the choices here are based on my specific hardware and preferences. They are documented in order to allow other users to install some, or all, of the software. The instructions assume that the current version has been downloaded and an initial clean install has been completed.

The process is:

1. <nowiki>[[#SourceSetup|Source Setup]]</nowiki>
2. <nowiki>[[#AdditionalRepositories|Additional Repositories]]</nowiki>
3. <nowiki>[[#RepositorySoftware |Add additional software from the Repositories]]</nowiki>
4. <nowiki>[[#OtherPPA |Add additional software from Personal Package Archives (PPA) Sources]]</nowiki>
5. <nowiki>[[#ExternalSoftware|Add external software from non-Repository sources]]</nowiki>

=== Source Setup ===

This section identifies the setup for Software Sources.

==== Accessing Software Sources ====

Software Sources are not enabled on the Dashboard by default on ubuntu 12.04. On a standard installation, they can be accessed by starting Update Manager and selecting settings. This will open the Software Sources.

If you wish to enable Software Sources separately then do the following:
** copy the following command into a Terminal: <code>gksudo gedit /usr/share/applications/software-properties-gtk.desktop</code>
** this will open up the Software Properties configuration file in an editor
** locate the line that reads: <code>NoDisplay=true</code>
** change the line to read: <code>NoDisplay=false</code>
** save the file, then close the editor.
** Software Sources should now be searchable from the Dashboard

==== Specific Settings ====

The Software Sources page has five tabs. My recommended settings for the tabs are shown below. In order to change your settings, select the item that you wish to change. For the first time you change an item, you will be asked for your password.

===== Ubuntu Software =====

The Ubuntu Software tab should be set as shown below:<<BR>>

<nowiki>[[File:Source1.png|align=left]]</nowiki><<BR>>

===== Other Software =====

On the Other Software tab, ensure that the Canonical Partners sources are enabled. Any other changes to the entries in this tab are managed by adding or changing Repositories, which will be described as needed in the remainder of this documentation.<<BR>>

<nowiki>[[File:Source2.png|align=left]]</nowiki><<BR>>

===== Updates =====

I set the updates tab so that it will not notify of a new version of ubuntu. I have generally found it better to do a clean installation of the next version of ubuntu. I have found Backports to be useful. Backports are when there are new applications or changes to existing applications that were originally developed for a later version of ubuntu, but were then made available to selected earlier versions. Ubuntu 12.04 is a Long-Term Support version of ubuntu, so there will be changes from time to time.

The Updates tab should be set as shown below:<<BR>>
<nowiki>[[File:Source3.png|align=left]]</nowiki><<BR>>

===== Authenticiation =====

Authentication contains the keys that are used to verify that software being downloaded does come from a recognized repository. These keys are managed when additional repositories are added.

A sample Authentication tab is shown below:<<BR>>
<nowiki>[[File:Source4.png|align=left]]</nowiki><<BR>>

===== Statistics =====

The Statistics tab controls whether usage statistics are sent to Canonical or not. Personally, I chose to not send these Statistics, as shown below:<<BR>>
<nowiki>[[File:Source5.png|align=left]]</nowiki><<BR>>

=== Additional Repositories ===
There is some software that I typically install that is only available through additional Repositories. Most of the repositories may be either edited in Software Sources or added through a terminal.

==== Medibuntu ====
This repository used to contain software that was required to process restricted content as well as enabling DVD playback. The repository has been closed and alternatives exist.

==== Oracle Java ====
By default, Ubuntu uses Open Java. Some applications, such as eclipse, require Oracle Java.

There are two components to Oracle Java - the JRE (Java Runtime Environment) which is used to execute Java programs and the JDK (Java Development Kit) which is used in the development of Java programs. Java was first created by Sun Microsystems. The original software license allowed for Linux distros, including Ubuntu, to maintain the packages in their archives, simplifying the installation. Oracle Corporation purchased Sun Microsystems in 2011. The license terms for Java have been changed in such a way that Linux distros can no longer directly maintain the package within their archives.

A group of users, collectively referred to as webupd8, maintain a number of PPA archives in !Launchpad. One of the PPAs includes a program to install Oracle Java from the Oracle website. This is a simple method to install Oracle Java. In this case, this installs the JDK, which also includes the JRE. The current version is Oracle Java 7.

To add this PPA, copy the following text into a Terminal and execute:

  <code>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java && sudo apt-get --quiet update</code>

To install the Oracle Java, copy the following command into a Terminal and execute:

  <code>sudo apt-get install oracle-java7-installer</code>

This will setup the Oracle Java installer. During the installation process for this program, you will be shown a license agreement. You must agree to the terms in this agreement in order to install the software.

==== Custom Themes ====
There are two themes that I like, both of which require the installation of Personal Package Archives (PPA) and an Advanced Settings tool:

===== Faenza Themes and Icons =====
The Faenza themes and icons developed by Matthieu James. To add this PPA, copy the following text into a Terminal and execute:<<BR>>

  <code>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:tiheum/equinox && sudo apt-get --quiet update</code><<BR>>

To install the themes, copy the following commands into a Terminal and execute:<<BR>><<BR>>
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <(><code>sudo apt-get install faenza-icon-theme</code>
| 
| <(>This will install the Faenza icons. (Faenza)
|-
| <(><code>sudo apt-get install faience-*</code>
| 
| <(>This will install the Faenza themes. (Faenza)
|}

===== Adwaita-Cupertino-GTK-Theme =====
The Adwaita-Cupertino themes and icons developed are maintained by the Webupd8 Team. To add this PPA, copy the following text into a Terminal and execute:<<BR>>

  <code>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/themes && sudo apt-get --quiet update</code><<BR>>

To install the themes, copy the following commands into a Terminal and execute:<<BR>><<BR>>
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <(><code>sudo apt-get install adwaita-cupertino-gtk-theme</code>
| 
| <(>This will install the theme and icons. (Webupd8 Team)
|}

==== nVidia Drivers ====
The latest version of the nVidia Drivers that is in the current repository is nVidia 3-19. This set of drivers is stable and provides excellent performance. The driver may be installed by selecting Additional Hardware Drivers from the Settings application.

==== Solaar ====
I have a Logitech Unifying Receiver installed on my computer. Solaar is a program that supports the management of the receiver and the devices connected to the receiver. There are still small bugs, but on the whole, the application works very well. The program is found in a PPA

To add this PPA, copy the following text into a Terminal and execute:

<code>sudo apt-add-repository ppa:daniel.pavel/solaar && sudo apt-get --quiet update</code>

To install the program, copy and paste the following command into a Terminal and execute:

<code>sudo apt-get install solaar</code>

Solaar is added to the Startup programs and will start automatically when the workstation is rebooted.

==== LibreOffice 4.1 ====
By default, Ubuntu 12.04 Repositories contain the LibreOffice 3.6 editions. If you wish to use LibreOffice 4.1, then add the LibreOffice ppa and update the existing installation.

To add this PPA and update the existing LibreOffice installation, copy the following text into a Terminal and execute:

  <code>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:libreoffice/ppa && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade</code>

==== Banshee PPA ====
Banshee is a music player that I have found useful. There is a version in the standard archives, but the Banshee team also maintains a Personal Package Archive (PPA) that contains their latest stable version.

To add this PPA, copy the following text into a Terminal and execute:

  <code>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:banshee-team/ppa</code>

Banshee will be installed as part of the installation of the Repository Software.

==== Chromium Web Browser ====
Many people prefer Chromium as their web browser, as opposed to Firefox. Chromium is the open-source browser from which Google Chrome derives.

There is a Personal Package Archive that contains the latest stable release of Chromium for Ubuntu.

To add this PPA, copy the following text into a Terminal and execute:

<code>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:a-v-shkop/chromium && sudo apt-get --quiet update</code>

To install the program, copy and paste the following command into a Terminal and execute:

<code>sudo apt-get install chromium-browser</code>

=== Repository Software ===
This is software that is installed from the repositories and the PPAs.

==== Software List ====
This is the additional software that I typically install from the Repositories. Each item may also include other items to be installed. For example, the <code>mozilla-plugin-vlc</code> will also include the Video LAN Client (VLC) software.

Note that if installing to a 32-bit version, the only change to this list would be to use w32codecs instead of w64codecs.

==== Quick Installation using Terminal ====
If the Source Settings and Repositories are set as shown above, then the following command will install all of the suggested software. This can be copied from here and pasted into a Terminal. During the installation, there will be '''one license agreement confirmation''' for Microsoft (the additional fonts).

<code>sudo apt-get install ntp banshee evolution evolution-indicator gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad-multiverse gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly dvdrip inkscape mozilla-libreoffice mozilla-plugin-vlc sound-juicer soundconverter easytag-aac gparted cheese libreoffice gnome-system-tools gnome-tweak-tool cups-pdf guvcview ttf-mscorefonts-installer w64codecs skype flashplugin-installer</code>

==== Finishing Touches ====

1. The library program for VLC needs an additional script to enable DVD playback. To that:
** open Sources - either directly or through settings on the Update Manager - and add the following two repositories: deb http://download.videolan.org/pub/debian/stable/ / and deb-src http://download.videolan.org/pub/debian/stable/ /
** copy the following command into a Terminal: <code>wget -O - http://download.videolan.org/pub/debian/videolan-apt.asc|sudo apt-key add -</code>
** copy the following command into a Terminal: <code>sudo /usr/share/doc/libdvdread4/install-css.sh</code>
    
2. A screen toolkit needs to be identified. To do this:
** copy the following command into a Terminal: <code>gksudo gedit /etc/profile</code>
** this will open up the profile in an editor
** add a new line at the end of the profile and insert the following text: <code>AWT_Toolkit=MToolkit</code>
** save the file, then close the editor.

3. Thunderbird should be removed if you are using evolution. To do that:
** copy the following command into a Terminal: <code>sudo apt-get remove thunderbird</code>

4. I have a lot of screen real estate - dual monitors, each 24 inches. For this reason, the Global Menu is really annoying. The Global Menu can be removed if desired. To do that:
** copy the following command into a Terminal: <code>sudo apt-get remove indicator-appmenu</code>

5. I also disable the Guest Account. To do this:
** copy the following command into a Terminal: <code>gksudo gedit /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf</code>
** this will open the lightdm configuration file in an editor.
** add a new line at the end of the profile and insert the following text: <code>allow-guest=false</code>
** save the file and close the editor.
** this will take effect on the next reboot of the workstation.

=== External Software ===
This is software that is not installed from the repositories.

==== Fluendo ====
Fluendo Group is a company that specializes in the creation and distribution of gstreamer codecs for various audio and video formats. The benefit of using these is that they include a license for the codec. They include codecs for Windows Media Lossless format and several other proprietary formats. The fees are very reasonable (IMHO) and I have been using them since 2008. They recently have been included in the Ubuntu store. Their website is <nowiki>[[http://www.fluendo.com]]</nowiki>. The licenses are purchased for a specific term. During the term you may download and install any updates to the number of computers covered by the license. I don't run virtual machines, so I don't know how the licensing works in that environment.

Once paid for, you may go to their download page and download the appropriate file for your system (either 32-bit or 64-bit for your distribution). Once the download is complete, you then double-click on the file to install it. It will be installed using the Ubuntu Software Center.

==== Eclipse ====
Prior to installing Eclipse, ensure that the Oracle Java software has been installed and is the current version.

This is a general purpose IDE used for development. This is installed directly from the website (http://www.eclipse.org), since the version of eclipse in the repositories is not current.

These instructions have been updated to Eclipse 4.3 (Kepler).

===== Overview =====
When this installation is complete:

* The eclipse program files will be installed in the /opt/eclipse folder.
* A user group called 'eclipse' will exist and authorized users will be associated with that group.
* All entries in the /opt/eclipse folder will: be owned by root, be associated with the eclipse group.
* The eclipse group will have full access to the entries in the folder. Other users will have read-only access.
* There will be a launch item in Applications > Programming that will start eclipse.
* Specific update sites will be added to the Available Software sites in the eclipse installation. 

===== Installation Instructions =====

# Verify that any previous installation has been completely removed. In particular, the following needs to be verified:
## There is no eclipse folder under /opt. If there is, it must be deleted. Sudo access will be required to delete the folder.
2. There is no eclipse folder under /usr/local/share. If there is, it must be deleted. Sudo access will be required to delete the folder.
3. There is no entry for eclipse in either /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin. If there is, then the entry must be deleted.
4. There is no entry for eclipse.desktop in /usr/share/applications. If there is, then the entry must be deleted.
5. There is no configuration files for eclipse in the users' home folders. These are hidden directories. If there are any, these must be deleted.
2. Verify that there is a group called 'eclipse' and that users are authorized in that group:
1. Select System > Administration > Users and Groups.
2. Select Unlock and provide your password.
3. Select Manage Groups
4. Scroll the list to determine if there is a group called 'eclipse'. If there is not, then add the group.
5. Ensure that all users, including root, are members of the eclipse group. 
3. Obtain the appropriate file from http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/. Only one of the packages is required. The file should be '''opened using archive manager'''. When the download is complete, extract the files to the Downloads folder. If done correctly, there will be an eclipse subfolder in the Downloads folder.
4. When the download has been completed, open a Terminal and execute the following commands:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <(><code>cd ~/Downloads</code>
| 
| <(>Change to where the file was downloaded
|-
| <(><code>sudo mv eclipse /opt/eclipse</code>
| 
| <(>Move the files to a folder under the /opt folder. /opt is the normal folder where external applications are installed.
|-
| <(><code>sudo chown -R root:eclipse /opt/eclipse</code>
| 
| <(>Change the owner to root and the group to eclipse.
|-
| <(><code>sudo chmod -R 775 /opt/eclipse</code>
| 
| <(>Owner and members of the group can read/write/delete, other users have read access.
|-
| <(><code>sudo chmod +x /opt/eclipse/eclipse</code>
| 
| <(>The Eclipse program file must be executable.
|}
5. If running Unity (ubuntu 11.04 or later), the application may be added to the launcher. To add to the launcher:
1. Open a Terminal and copy the following command: <code>gksudo gedit /usr/share/applications/eclipse.desktop</code>
2. Copy and paste the following lines into the file:
<pre>
[Desktop Entry]

TargetEnvironment=Unity
</pre>
3. Save the file and close gedit and the terminal.
4. Start eclipse from the Dash.
5. When Eclipse is open, there will be an icon in the launcher. Right click on the icon and select the keep in launcher option.
6. When Eclipse is closed, the icon will remain in the launcher.

==== LightScribe ====
If you have a LightScribe enabled disc drive, then there is software available that will allow you to prepare disc labels in Ubuntu. This is installed from the LightScribe website.

1. Obtain the software from: <nowiki>[[http://www.lightscribe.com/downloadSection/linux/index.aspx|LightScribe website.]]</nowiki> You will need both the System software and the simple labeler software.

2. The following instructions will install the software once it has been obtained:
1. Open a Terminal.
2. Execute the following commands in sequence:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <(><code>cd ~/Downloads</code>
