=== FloridaTeam Reporting Page ===
Welcome to the FloridaTeam reporting page. Every month this page should be filled with bullet points indicating the summary of some of the work you have been working on. As you work on something, try to summarize it here. 

'''Team Reporting How To''' 
1. Create a page https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FloridaTeam/TeamReports/10/CURRENTMONTH and add bulleted items. A few guidelines for how to write good points here:

** Keep it simple and short - single sentences are best. :)
** Try to summarize your work and not be over-detailed - we don't need to know specifics, just a summary of the kind of work involved
** Where possible, include relevant links.
 
1. Edit the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FloridaTeam/TeamReports/Current| Team Reports Current]]</nowiki> page to include a link to https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FloridaTeam/TeamReports/10/CURRENTMONTH.
