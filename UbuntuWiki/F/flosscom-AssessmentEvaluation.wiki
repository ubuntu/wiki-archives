~+''' Assessment and evaluation in Free / Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS)'''+~

== Introduction ==

Unlike in education there usually is no formal assessment or evaluation of learning outcomes in FLOSS. However, FLOSS participants might be assessed and evaluated by different means.

In FLOSS communities the code is evaluated in terms of its effectiveness and neatness. There is no formal assessment though of the learning that takes place. This is very different from education, where most of the activity is focused on formal assessment.

In this page you should contribute your experience of how assessment and evaluation takes place in FLOSS communities, and the type of measures, formal and informal, that are used to judge someone's status or contribution. For example, how does someone gain status in a community? How is code assessed as being worthy of integration into the core? When is someone's opinion valued highly? How are resolutions resolved?

== Peer review ==

An often used mechanism is the mechanism of peer review.
