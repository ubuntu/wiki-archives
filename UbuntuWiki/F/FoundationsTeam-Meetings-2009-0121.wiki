=== Activity reports ===
==== Colin Watson ====
* Installer:
** Fixed apt-setup #316618, which broke for some Alpha 3 users (though not all, mysteriously).
** Fixed a parted bug that broke Wubi. Then fixed the way that fix broke all other partitioning, which was my own stupid fault    (#317709).
** Fixed udev-udeb (needed to have something in /lib/udev/devices/).
** debootstrap fix to make sure /dev/console exists for two-stage bootstraps.
** Simplified oem-config page/step configuration.
** Fixed oem-config #48144.
** Started work on adding manual package selection to the server installer (server-pre-installation).

* Ubuntu 8.04.2:
** Assistance with acpi-support regression fix (#59695).
** Analysis of xine-lib regression (#290768).
** 8.04.2 change summary.

* Planning:
** Further watching of archive-reorganisation UDS videos, related specification improvement, community governance call, and discussion with Soyuz team.
** Fed Ubuntu priorities to Soyuz team for Launchpad 3.0.

* Minor adjustments to ubuntu-restricted-extras, inspired by a thread on sounder.

* Spec reviews:
** jaunty-cruftremover-improvements (small review comments)
** jaunty-codec-install (approved)
** jaunty-apturl-add-repo (approved)

* Installed Max Bowsher's outdate-report script on cocoplum, outputting to:
** http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-archive/testing/jaunty_outdate_all.txt
** http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-archive/testing-ports/jaunty_outdate_all.txt

* Set up daily CD builds for armel (mostly, anyway).

==== Evan Dandrea ====
* Background research on other distributions slideshows for Ken in preparation for our own.
* Started working on adding the ability to run gnome-app-install inside a chroot of the extracted squashfs after an email with mvo clarified the necessity to use a chroot here.
* Did some more work on the WrapLabel python class for UbuntuSpec:jaunty-ubiquity-usability.  Not quite working yet.
* Discovered a few bugs in the ecryptfs integration in ubiquity. Fixed the more obvious ones and traced a more complex issue to the ecryptfs kernel module.
* Looked into umenu not working in 8.04.2 after being poked by davmor2.  This has since been fixed.
* Spoke with lfaraone about him adding SD card support to usb-creator.  Also helped him debug SD card support in casper.
* Modified ubiquity to start fullscreened when in the "Install Ubuntu" mode as per UbuntuSpec:jaunty-ubiquity-usability.
* Quickly added support for ext4 to casper.

==== James Westby ====

* Distributed Development
** Call with Jono and Daniel about the community aspects of the work.
** Planning for the next lot of work, and trying to come up with solutions for some sticky UI problems.

* Ubuntu
** Debugging a potential -updates/-proposed regression with a user. Turned out to be a long-standing known issue with gconf-schemas. The problem was caused by the action of upgrading, rather than the content of the upgrades.
** Did some of the ImageMagick transition.
** Sponsoring. cccd, sugar-datastore, iptux, easystroke, wiipdf, drupal5, fbreader, subdownloader, svk, docutils-writer-manpage, kannel, gtkam, drupal6, firebug, teeworlds, grandr.

==== Lars Wirzenius ====
 
===== Done this week =====
* Attempted to convert personal mirrors from debmirror to reprepro, but found out that reprepro wants to re-build Release.gpg files, which would require adding a new key to every apt instance I have. Too much work. Decided to nuke the mirrors and stick to the official ones, since I'm not doing archive-wide lintian or piuparts runs these days.
* Prepared a system-cleaner upload (1.10.5-0ubuntu1), which Michael Vogt kindly sponsored. This upload includes all changes made in the intrepid SRU upload, plus enables the autoremovable plugin.
* Verified that piuparts on various releases can test packages on all relevant releases. This works after one installs debootstrap from backports. After that, hardy, intrepid, and jaunty versions of Ubuntu can test packages in dapper, hardy, intrepid, and jaunty.
* Reported a potential license problem in the digikam package (LP: ##319230).
* Wrote an outline for the UDW session on piuparts I'll be giving on Friday.
* Started work on the .dpkg-old/new plugin.
* Fixed my virtual machines to actually run unattended-upgrades.

===== Remaining from past weeks =====
* Renaming of program and packages.
* .dpkg-old/new and unpurged packages plugins not done.
* Integration with update-manager sources not done.

===== Plans for the coming week =====
* Finish the .dpkg-old/new plugin.
* Rename Cruft Remover to Computer Janitor. Packages, too.
* Finish the JauntyCruftRemover spec.
* Prepare a branch of update-manager that adds the plugin management and shared plugins from system-cleaner, for review by Michael Vogt.

==== Luke Yelavich ====
* Audio 
** bug triaging.
** Uploaded a new revision of alsa-utils to include some fixes from upstream git (Thanks to Daniel T Chen), and to ensure alsamixer, amixer, and iecset do not show anything related to pulseaudio.
** Submitted another audio hardware quirk upstream, thanks to Bryce Harrington. This patch was accepted, and I will pass it onto the kernel guys shortly.
** Started tracking down bugs for audio hardware not working in jaunty, to either collect fixes from upstream , or attempt to write quirks where possible.
** Investigate why alsa-source fails to build using module-assistant, and start to fix it properly, still ongoing.
** After some investigation, discovered that bi-arch pulseaudio libraries is not possible, due to there being way too many dependencies, and a large chunk of autoconf/automake/m4 code needing to be rewritten for the pulseaudio package in order to do it properly.
** Uploaded a new revision of alsa-lib to include a few extra plugins relating to the smixer interface that were not previously included.

* Accessibility 
** Uploaded new upstream versions of gok, gnome-orca, mousetweaks, at-spi, and accerciser.

* dmraid 
** Discovered some more upstream breakage relating to querying dmraid about raid set information. One has to pass the complete raid set name to dmraid, at least for isw (intel software raid) raid sets. Haven't tried with other raid formats yet. Not sure where to fix the issue yet.
** Started playing with dmraid + ubiquity, and discovering that the UI part of the install largely works, however ubiquity crashes during install. Investigation is ongoing.
** Start putting together notes for a dmraid test plan on real hardware and in a vm.

* Misc 
** UbuntuStudio image testing for alpha 3.
** No sponsoring this week, bad me. Testing took its place.

==== Matthias Klose ====
* Setting up the Babbage board; took longer than expected due to some hardware problems. Installed jaunty.
* Testing and uploading gcc-4.3.3 release candidates, prepared gcc-4.3 for intrepid.

* openjdk and cacao updates. upstream fixes to build without precompiled headers and to build the shark based vm.
