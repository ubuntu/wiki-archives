=== Firmware Test Suite - power_button test ===

This interactive test sanity checks the operation of the ACPI power button found on netbooks and laptops.  Two tests are performed:

* Check the existence of power button(s) (in the /proc/acpi/button/power/*/info fields)
* Request power button to be pressed and check if an ACPI button/power event occurs

See section "4.7.2.2.1 Power Button" of the ACPI specification for more details.

==== Examples: ====

<pre>
fwts power_button - 
</pre>

..runs the test on your machine and dumps the output to stdout. This test requires user interaction.

=== Explanation of test results ===

Certain test results may require a little more explanation. This section will try and give some context to specific test failures.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| Error ID
| Explanation
|-
| NoButtonPath
| /proc/acpi/button/power does not exist, either because /proc is not mounted or the APCI button driver could not find the button HID PNP0C0C.
|-
| NoPowerButtonField
| The power button /proc/acpi/button/power/*/info field did not exist. This should not occur.
|-
| NoPowerButtonEvents
| No ACPI button events detected. This could indicate either that either the ACPI SCI interrupt or the button GPE are failing to be triggered, or perhaps the acpid is not picking these events up from the kernel.
