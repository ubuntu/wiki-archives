=== Summary ===

I suggest using f-spot as the default application to be used to import photo's from a digital camera.

=== Rationale ===

As of edgy, F-Spot has been installed since install, yet gThumb is still being used by default to import photos from cameras.

I feel F-Spot would be a better default choice for this.

F-Spot has many advantages:

* It is quicker
* It looks slicker (Important on the new user front)
* It supports photo touch ups
* It supports exporting to the web
* Plus much much more...

Gthumb has more advantages:

* It is quicker IMHO (in fact this is not very much comparable)
* It is very well suited for quick view & edit tasks, where F-spot would be an overkill
* It also looks very nice
* It supports photo touch ups
* It supports directory views, which integrates it very well to the default Ubuntu Desktop. ''F-spot has no way to view all pictures in a directory.''

=== Use cases ===

* Joe brings his camera back from a day out, and turn's on the ol' faithful Ubuntu. Upon clicking the import button that automatically pops up when he connects his camera he is presented with a feature-sparse image viewer. Now he thinks that this must be the best of Linux as it's been set as the default.

=== Scope ===

This covers Ubuntu, I'm not sure about the default app used by the Kubuntu user, that might be better anyway.

=== Implementation ===

All that would need to be done would be to change the default from whatever it is now to 'f-spot-import %h' in the 'Removable Drives and Media' dialog.
