== Ubuntu Dinner ==

We will also organize an Ubuntu dinner on Saturday evening. Details and a list to subscribe will be available at the Ubuntu booth on Saturday (we will probably have to confirm somewhere during the afternoon, so please put your name on the list early on Saturday if you can!).

The following list can be used to indicate intentions, but is not a formal subscription.  Make sure you add your name to the list at the booth too!

== Ubuntu Developers, Contributors, etc. ==

It's quite common for upstream developers & developers from other distros to ask us at the Ubuntu booth if $UBUNTU_DEVELOPER_X or $AN_UBUNTU_DEVELOPER_FAMILIAR_WITH_Y is at FOSDEM, and often we don't know the answer.  Because of that, it would be cool if Ubuntu developers who come to FOSDEM could somehow list when/where they can be found during FOSDEM...

Of course, if you give a talk, please also mention this in the appropriate section!
