** Investigate patches that moblin may have (AndyWhitcroft)
** Make the populate_rootfs() call happen in parallel with the rest of the kernel startup (AndyWhitcroft)
* i915 drm driver takes 1.5s to init on its own
** Investigate patches that moblin may have (AndyWhitcroft)
** and remove need to load i915 from the initramfs (ScottJamesRemnant)
* Clean up initramfs console setting (ScottJamesRemnant)
