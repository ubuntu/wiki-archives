~+''' Support & Contacts'''+~

There are different ways to get support, or to get in contact with others, as following shown.

== Launchpad Questions and Answers ==

You might want to ask it at Launchpad, or see what others asked.

You can find it here:
http://answers.launchpad.net/flosscom

== FLOSSCom Forums ==

You might want to use the FLOSSCom forum to ask a question, or to browse what others asked.

You can find it here: http://flosscom.net/index.php?option=com_joomlaboard&Itemid=28&func=showcat&catid=9 

== Meetings and talks over flashmeeting ==

You might want to re-listen to one of our meetings and talks, or to organize one yourself. We are more than glad to assist you with this and to participate at any meeting and talk that you like to set up.

In this case just go here: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/flosscom/talks

== Wiki (Ubuntu) ==

You certainly can also use the wiki to raise questions, or just to go straight ahead and insert what you feel is missing.

In this case please go to: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/flosscom

== Chat ==

We haven’t identified any easy to use chat yet, but like most of you we do use a range of chat services like skype, g-talk, yahoo messenger, or IRC.

We are more than glad in participating at chats in any environment you suggest.

If you see one that you think is the one we should use, just go ahead and implement it where ever you see it should be. 

We know that IRC is particularly popular in the open source scene, but many people outside this scene think that it is too difficult to set it up. 

Well, let’s not discuss about if they are right, or wrong – just show them how easy it is in the case that’s what you think we should use. There are many people out there that resist to any application that demands more than clicking twice the button “next”. So we need to respect that, or help them learning it.

== FLOSSCom Community Mail Service ==

If you registered at the FLOSSCom side just go to the community user list and send out private mails to the ones you like to ask.
