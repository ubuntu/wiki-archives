~+''' FLOSS / Open Source (and alike) learning cases '''+~

Cases, like <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case|use cases]]</nowiki> or <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_study|case studies]]</nowiki>, are a good way of explaining things to others and help them to understand. 

We would like to collect at this page cases of FLOSS / Open Source communities and how they work as learning environments, plus cases from the education landscape that are similar to FLOSS / Open Source like learning.

There is currently no case study template for you to fill in to provide a case, but be invited to help us developing one.
