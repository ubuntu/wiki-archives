== Plans for becoming approved ==
* Essentially, all the other points of the meeting revolve around this
=== Wikis ===
* To become an Ubuntu member you must have a wiki
* Include accomplishments, plans, etc.
* Make your wiki page title your real name or your name as listed on the team page, in wiki style
* For example:
** ChrisRohde
** JohnDoe
* These are incorrect:
** Chris Rohde
** asjh5645kjha
* Unified presence
* Work might need to be delegated to someone to set up a template for user pages
* Icons can be inserted to wikis from the IconsPage
* Other good personal wiki examples
* StephenStalcup
* ['Nixternal']
=== Promotion ===
* If you are interested in promotion
* The LoCo Contacts list may be useful
* The marketing team is also a group worth joining
* Creating Ubuntu stickers for car windows
* Figuring out groups willing to adopt Ubuntu locally
* We need to demonstrate why the "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" mentality does not apply to Ubuntu
* Perhaps demonstrate why their cuurent OS is broke
* Malicious bugs etc.
* Show how good Windows software works on Linux
* OpenOffice
* Firefox / Thunderbird
* GIMP
* Show price benefit of Ubuntu
* Advocating availibility of free support on forum, wiki, mailing-list
* Creating some Florida Specific backgrounds

=== Personal Skills ===
* ChrisRohde: Personally, as I am sure all of you know, I have far inferior computer skills... all I can really hope to bring here is a level of organization, and a desire to see us succeed.. sort of an enabler, as it were.
* xzai: i do video work, i can draw, web design, im pretty much just an artist
* BodyCoach2: Writer, volunteer work, photography
* MikeFeravolo: 20+ enginering and business experince 
* ep2011: Decent Web Design, Basic Graphic design and basic php/mysql.
=== Outside of Agenda ===
==== Bugs ====
* Taking time to file bugs as we find them can help immensely
==== FreeGeek Chapter ====
* Starting a <nowiki>[[http://www.freegeek.org/|Free Geek]]</nowiki> chapter
* Gives us the opporunity to give away computers with Ubuntu to people who need computers
* BodyCoach2 has already given away 16 computers with Ubuntu variants
* Gives us another way to get approved as an official LoCo
* Organizing each independent person might mean we would be able to come up with our own Free Geek variant
==== Sub-Teams ====
* We can organize into sub-teams with different responsibilities
* A good example is the Ohio Team
* A team for marketing is proposed: "team for people persons"
* Mike_F offers to run a programming team when our team is ready for one
