| Targeted enhancements to the UI and experience for Software Center version 4.0.  == Improved Unity integration ==  - Startup performance.             - Showing how to launch newly-installed applications.            - Disable "Find it in the menu" feature when running under Unity as it is not applicable there.       - Improve user feedback during software installation/removal.        == Improvements to the software purchase experience ==  - Better integration of the purchase experience into the application.                 - Improve user feedback during each phase of the purchase experience.  - Deauthorizing your computer.      - Make new for-purchase items show up in "What's New".       == General Usability Improvements ==  - More helpful search screen for no results       - Re-enable the default selected item when showing a listview.       - Show category/subcategory when navigating to an item via search or "What's New".       - Convert to use gsettings (sure, it's not a UI enhancement, but we'll track it here).       ----------  Planned for Software Center 4.0 but covered (and work items tracked) in a separate blueprint:   - Ratings and Reviews.

| Several options exist for setting up a local mirror or cache of the Ubuntu archives (apt-mirror, debmirror, apt-cacher-ng, apt-proxy, approx...) but none of them is fully supported in main. Any site with more than 2 Ubuntu machines is likely to set up one of those, we should investigate options, promote to main and support the relevant one(s).

| This is a blueprint to address many issues with oem-config that OEMs have addressed as issues to the first user experience.  - ) OEM config Usability issues         1) Configure wireless screen            * This was bumped for other 10.04 but should get into 10.10            LP# 371444         2) Hover over text           * This was bumped for other 10.04 but should get into 10.10            LP# 315648         4) When Windows Maximize text will disappear         5) When configuring system should not say "installing system"             as it does today. Should say "configuring" or have no text at the             top at all.         6) When system is configuring OEM config will not show the Slide            Show             * Evan says this is where slide show is not kept on th system. For OEMs like Dell they do keep slide show on the system                and it's a great experience.       7) OEM-Config removal experience is not that great             * fixed at the last minute for 10.04. But needs serious improvment for 10.04.

| Currently if the Backports repository is enabled, all packages present in the pocket are considered for installation.  Backports is not, by design, particularly suitable for all packages for all users.  It is intended to be for users to install specific packages to gain specific features from a newer release.  The goal should be for packages to only be installed when user requested or when required as a dependency of a requested package.

| At the moment, an Ubuntu system can only be (release) upgraded by using apt (advanced user) or the upgrade-manager (GUI / CLI). The upgrade-manager depends on a file hosted on changelogs.ubuntu.com called meta-release, to determine whether an upgrade is possible and locate the upgrade tool tarball. This blueprint proposes that these files get moved onto normal mirrors so that a disconnected system with a complete mirror available (quite common in the developing world) can upgrade in a user-friendly manner.

| The current installation tools set a default hostname based on some device detection.  The current detection algorithm is based parsing dmidecode and falling back to laptop-detect if that doesn't work.  This is confusing if folks have a phone, a handheld, a laptop, a desktop, a set-top box, and a NAS laying about, and want to ensure these all have distinct names.  The algorithm should be extended to attempt to detect several hardware components, or guess based on attributes of hardware components (a 2.5" 1024x600 screen is probably a phone and a 10" 1024x600 screen is probably a netbook), and generalised to work for all architectures, rather than relying on dmidecode.

| <rowbgcolor="#00ff00"> <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/packageselection-foundations-n-event-based-initramfs|packageselection-foundations-n-event-based-initramfs]]</nowiki> (0/0/7)
| Initramfs is used for getting the root filesystem mounted and passing control the real init on the real root fs. Once the kernel boots, it passes control to the init in the initramfs. This init then runs scripts that are responsible for checking if the root device is configured properly and capable of mounting the root fs on it. In parallel, behind the scenes, udev runs and uses the help of blkid to run "admin" scripts like "mdadm", "lvm", "cryptsetup" to configure the root device. This is all event based, i.e the devices are configured as and when they become available. However the exception to this is configuring the LUKS devices, which are configured using cryptsetup. The script that runs cryptsetup, first checks up if the device which is to be configured as an encrypted device, is available. If not then it waits for some time and then it checks again if the device is available or not. If not then it will simply give up and get the user to a busybox prompt. If the device is available, then cryptsetup is called and the device is configured as a LUKS device. Once the device is available a udev event is generated and again, udev runs blkid and calls whatever admin script needs to be called if any other subsystem is stacked on top of this LUKS device. While all this is good, there are two observations to be made here:  a. The invocation of cryptsetup is procedural and not completely event based.  b. There is a repeatition of code for mounting, checking filesystems, crypt devices, LVM devices and so on - one code path is found in upstart jobs and the other in initramfs.  So one idea that lets you remove this duplication and at the same time enables the LUKS devices in an event based fashion, is to make the initramfs event based in the true sense, by bringing in upstart in initramfs. This means that we copy the jobs in /etc/init/ in initramfs and run them at boot time. This brings in the simplicity, elegance and robustness of upstart in initramfs and also gives you more flexibility to handle the events in a way that you want

| It would be good to have some kind of CI framework for testing Python packages, specifically centered around transitions in major versions within the 2 and 3 families, as well as compatibility with Python 3 (perhaps via 2to3).  Part of the idea includes promoting best practices for upstream authors so that consistency is encouraged (e.g. 'python setup.py test' works).     * build  * run upstream unit test  * 2to3  * report on ftbfs and test failures  * against any/every python version

| Currently, each flavour has a ports/ directory, separating some architectures from others.  This is sometimes confusing to users looking to test various images, and sometimes confusing to administrators looking to add or remove various images.  Flavour coordinators often forget for which architectures their images are built, leading to gaps in ISO verification.  Consolidation of the /ports/ directories into the regular flavour directories would help provide a more accurate overview of the images made available for each flavour.  Mirror administrators are already expected to identify which architectures they prefer, so there should be little impact.
