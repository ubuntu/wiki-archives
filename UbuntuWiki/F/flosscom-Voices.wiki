~+''' Voices from the Open ~-(Source)-~ ''Education'' Revolution '''+~

<nowiki>[[http://www.netc.org/openoptions/index.html|Another project]]</nowiki> listened to the experience of educators on open source in education. Interestingly their sayings are also reflecting on open source principles for education.

* ''Tell us about your experience with open source in education and especially open source principles for education.''

* ''We like to hear both: voices from educators and voices from students!''

* ''Be also welcome of recommending your experience as a “Best Case” or just to share a “Lesson Learnt”.''

* ''Have your say too!''

* The open source model... The reason it works, the reason that good software comes out of it, is that it's based on collaboration. - Paul Nelson, K-12 educator <nowiki>[[http://www.netc.org/openoptions/background/community.html|''listened at...'']]</nowiki>

* Giving back is almost my version of giving payment for what I've gotten... - Mark Schmidt, K-12 educator <nowiki>[[http://www.netc.org/openoptions/background/community.html|''listened at...'']]</nowiki>

* They've been very free with their time and their expertise. .. They don't expect anything in return. - Don Wolff, K-12 educator <nowiki>[[http://www.netc.org/openoptions/background/community.html|''listened at...'']]</nowiki>

* The community's out there, and they're ready to help. ... A lot of the time it's just letting them know you're there. - Ben Mabbott, K-12 educator <nowiki>[[http://www.netc.org/openoptions/background/community.html|''listened at...'']]</nowiki>

* I've relied on the community a lot. ... I can usually get answers to issues I post within 24 hours, sometimes less. ... I've even in contact with some of the big guys, like I've had <nowiki>[[http://www.netc.org/openoptions/background/history.html#bazaar|Eric Raymond]]</nowiki> email me back and help me. These guys are available online. They're like the open source gurus and they'll help you out... Mike Harris with <nowiki>[[http://www.netc.org/openoptions/decisions/vendors.html#Red_Hat|Red Hat]]</nowiki>... A bunch of great guys. They'll help anybody out. A lot of them especially want to help the poor schools to open source. They've been very very helpful. - Anthony Baldwin, K-12 educator <nowiki>[[http://www.netc.org/openoptions/background/community.html|''listened at...'']]</nowiki>

* You feel like you're helping a grassroots movement rather than a big corporation. ... You say, Hey I'm a member of [this <nowiki>[[http://www.netc.org/openoptions/appendices/glossary.html#LUG|LUG]]</nowiki>], you can join their mailing list, and you're in. - Ben Mabbott, K-12 educator <nowiki>[[http://www.netc.org/openoptions/background/community.html|''listened at...'']]</nowiki>

* ...teaching our students those kind of community principles is something that we should be doing. - Anthony Baldwin, K-12 educator <nowiki>[[http://www.netc.org/openoptions/background/community.html|''listened at...'']]</nowiki>

* When you do usual stuff, it's easy to find solutions on the Web. - Ben Mabbott, K-12 educator <nowiki>[[http://www.netc.org/openoptions/pros_cons/deployment.html#service|''listened at...'']]</nowiki>

* Usually within a matter of a half hour or an hour I have several informative, correct answers to help me figure what I need to do to solve a problem. - Paul Nelson, K-12 educator <nowiki>[[http://www.netc.org/openoptions/pros_cons/deployment.html#service|''listened at...'']]</nowiki>

* Sometimes there are people in the community that say "read the stupid manual." I've seen a change in attitude over the last year. When I first came in, it seemed like there were a lot of guys, they were heavy duty geeks and there was almost a resistance to helping the clueless Windows users out. More and more I see people being helpful with people that are moving away from Windows to the open source world... people are more patient with stuff that seems pretty basic. - Anthony Baldwin, K-12 educator <nowiki>[[http://www.netc.org/openoptions/pros_cons/deployment.html#service|''listened at...'']]</nowiki>

* Get involved with mailing lists and local open source user groups; they are your best resource for advice and support. There is almost certainly a <nowiki>[[http://www.netc.org/openoptions/appendices/glossary.html#LUG|Linux Users Group]]</nowiki> in your area: find them! They probably have a website and a mailing list, which is a great resource for open source. Any problem you encounter has probably been seen before, and someone on the list probably has the solution, or can help find one. - Ben Mabbott, K-12 educator <nowiki>[[http://www.netc.org/openoptions/pros_cons/deployment.html#service|''listened at...'']]</nowiki>
