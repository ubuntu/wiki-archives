=== Introduction ===

Email: 
Hi, I am a teenager from Malta. I like computers a lot and right now I'm studying Computer Science at Advanced Level. I am also learning Java. I like experimenting with various things, both software and hardware (electronics). In fact I also have experience in mobile firmware editing (a lot of edits done in HEX), which in turn I flash onto my V3x with the new features. Now I have a ZN5 on what to experiment which also happens to be a Linux phone. Anyway, just a small background about me lol.

Thanks for reading,
ferrarix.
