Dear Friends,

I use Ubuntu since 2008, when I used 'Intrepid Ibex' version 8.10.
I think that Ubuntu Community is a great invention. Everyone can share free software!
It's the demonstration that when people works together the results are great!!
I'm not a programmer but I'm studying C and Java!!
I would to give a contribute to the community, even if iy will be very small.
I hope to learn something from this new experience. I think that in life you don't finish to learn!!

Filiberto
