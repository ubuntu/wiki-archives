== Lubuntu Human Interface Guidelines ==

This document will help you how to create applications that look right, behave properly, and fit into the Lubuntu desktop experience as a whole. It is written for interface designers, graphic artists and software developers who will be creating software for Lubuntu. Both specific advice on making effective use of interface elements, and the philosophy and general design principles behind the Lubuntu desktop are covered.

These guidelines are meant to help you design and write applications that are easy to use and consistent with the Lubuntu desktop. Following these guidelines will have many benefits:

* Users will learn to use your program faster, because interface elements will look and behave the way they are used to.

* Novice and advanced users alike will be able accomplish tasks quickly and easily, because the interface won't be confusing or make things difficult.

* Your application will have an attractive look that fits in with the rest of the desktop.

* Your application will continue to look good when users change desktop themes, fonts and colors.

To help you achieve these goals, these guidelines will cover basic interface elements, how to use them and put them together effectively, and how to make your application integrate well with the desktop.

These guidelines are based on <nowiki>[[http://developer.gnome.org/hig-book/3.0/index-info.html.en | GNOME Human Interface Guidelines 2.2.2]]</nowiki> (Copyright © 2002-2011  Calum Benson, Adam Elman, Seth Nickell, colin z robertson) and we would like you to refer to this document for anything that is not covered here. We do not wish to steal credit from the original authors, but rather apply their guidelines to our own needs. We would also like the thank the authors of GNOME Human Interface Guidelines 2.2.2 and the GNOME Project as a whole for their hard work and dedication.

== Usability Principles ==

=== Design for Old Hardware ===
Lubuntu's philosophy is to be lightweight, fast and energy conserving. It is also meant to be an alternative to Ubuntu for people with less powerful and/or old hardware. Therefore it is very important that developers and designers take old hardware into consideration. Applications need to have the same workflow on modern computer as they do on old computers, and it is very important that applications keep low resolution monitors in mind.

MAKE THIS SECTION EASIER TO READ. ALSO INCLUDE CODING "RESTRICTIONS".

=== Design for People ===
Remember that the purpose of any software application is to enable some group of people to accomplish a specific set of tasks. It's a good start to:

* Determine who your users are, and what you want to enable them to do. 

Lets say that you are designing an application for engineers, it is then very important that the application can be used by all engineers, and not limited to a certain group of engineers. This can be achieved by:

* Creating a match between your application and the real world.
* Use <nowiki>[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization|ISO standards]]</nowiki>.
* Make sure the application can be translated into different languages.

It is also important to remember that people are people, and not machines. Therefore we would like to remind you to:

* Keep the user informed by providing feedback to the user.
* Forgive the user and provide ''Undo'' buttons where appropriate, and always warn the user of dangerous actions.

Remember that computers exist to serve humans. A user should always feel in control, able to do what they want when they want. In other words:

* The user should also be able to tailor aspects of their environment to fit personal preferences. It is very important, however, to avoid the trap of allowing too much configuration, or allowing the configuration of parameters that most users will not understand or find useful to modify.

* ********************************

To create a consistent look and feel that the user is familiar with, it's important to keep it simple.

* Wherever possible, inherit visual and behavioral parameters from global preferences and settings such as the current GTK+ theme.
