=== Weekly summary ===

==== 2010-08-20 ====

* UbuntuSpec:foundations-m-btrfs-support (14%): No licensing progress, although we're still pushing.  We'll probably land the btrfs patches for GRUB if the licensing situation is resolved before beta, but otherwise aren't going to worry about the rest of this.
* UbuntuSpec:foundations-maverick-buy-something (0%, 1 task): While we only have one remaining task involving handling multiple currencies, there appears to be more un-milestoned work items at the top. Both lead developers,Gary Lasker and Michael Vogt, were on holiday this week, so we will have updates for next week. We can say that the ability to "Buy Something" from the Software Center is now working end to end :).
* UbuntuSpec:foundations-m-cd-build-speed (14%): Mostly non-user-facing and not urgent.  There've already been a number of sysadmin-side improvements here.
* UbuntuSpec:foundations-m-grub2-boot-framebuffer (47%): I think we may end up backing this out just before beta.  We haven't had as much time to work on it as I'd hoped, and there are a variety of kernel bugs prompted by this which haven't yet been resolved.
* UbuntuSpec:foundations-m-installer-redesign (48%): The bulk of this has landed, although there are a number of elements to polish.
* UbuntuSpec:foundations-m-package-culling (80%): A few merges remain, but this has been a very worthwhile project and is mostly complete.
* UbuntuSpec:foundations-m-python-versions (54%): We've postponed Python 2.7 support.  The rest of this can continue in the background and land in Natty.
* UbuntuSpec:foundations-m-robust-python-packaging (80%): The rest of this is not urgent for Maverick given that we've postponed Python 2.7 support.
* UbuntuSpec:foundations-m-spring-cleaning (47%): Lots of small tasks here, and we can safely stop at any time.
* UbuntuSpec:foundations-m-uefi-support: This is waiting on Colin managing to get his test machine to boot in UEFI mode ... after that the changes to enable it are relatively simple build system machinery.

==== 2010-07-16 ====

Our own work:

* UbuntuSpec:foundations-m-btrfs-support (33%, up from 0%): Significant movement on the licensing situation this week, so that's almost resolved, at which point we should at least be able to get it into Ubuntu.  Postponed upgrade-related work items to beta.
* UbuntuSpec:foundations-maverick-buy-something (47%, up from 24%): Client code for paid-for repositories written; integration between software-center-agent and xapian database complete; purchase transaction UI workflow implemented; UI to display the list of applications for sale implemented.
* UbuntuSpec:foundations-m-cd-boot: Deferred to maverick+1; too complex to complete in the time available, and has too many knock-on effects (e.g. in usb-creator), but we'll continue to work on this.
* UbuntuSpec:foundations-m-grub2-boot-framebuffer (42%, up from 25%): Uploaded the most invasive GRUB changes (still no default background, but that's relatively trivial in terms of impact).  Bug reports suggest some problems on ATI cards.
* UbuntuSpec:foundations-m-python-versions (15): Barry continues work on the Python 2.7 stack.
* UbuntuSpec:foundations-m-robust-python-packaging (36%): Continuing work on versioned .so file patch (http://bugs.python.org/issue9193) and PEP 3149 (http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3149/).
* UbuntuSpec:foundations-m-installer-redesign (0%): Mostly finished automatic partitioning page.  Working on the timezone page, including the geonames service.  Hoping to have timezone and Jockey/extras pages done before the sprint, allowing parallel debconf work to be a sprint target.
* UbuntuSpec:foundations-m-package-culling (60%): Down to 13 remaining merges.  One more good push should do it.
* UbuntuSpec:foundations-m-uefi-support (40%, up from 20%): Kernel team work item fixed.  The rest of this is a sprint target.

Contributions to other teams:

* UbuntuSpec:arm-m-tool-chain-selection (50%): Test rebuild done (main only).
* UbuntuSpec:mobile-maverick-arm-improved-subarch-detection (100%): Reviewed as requested.
* UbuntuSpec:server-maverick-uec-liveusb (0%): Sprint target.

Other work items unchanged from 2010-07-09.

==== 2010-07-09 ====

Still above the trend line, although we have a lot of work in progress (for example UbuntuSpec:foundations-m-installer-redesign is much further on that the percentage makes it look, because nothing has actually landed yet).  Colin may look at representing this explicitly in the burndown chart so that it's more visible.

Our own work:

* UbuntuSpec:foundations-m-btrfs-support (0%): Surbhi sent a patch to GRUB upstream, and is awaiting feedback.  We won't know whether licensing will be such that we can integrate this until after review.
* UbuntuSpec:foundations-maverick-buy-something (24%, up from 18%): Work progresses; Michael has mostly been working on underpinnings such as lazr.restfulclient integration.
* UbuntuSpec:foundations-m-grub2-boot-framebuffer (25%, up from 17%): Discovered that we don't need to change pm-utils.  Aside from that, Colin and Andy have been spending time trying to thrash out exactly the right interface between GRUB and the kernel.  Ironically, this is easier without KMS, and there are some difficulties with the switch to KMS which will need attention.
* UbuntuSpec:foundations-m-installer-redesign (0%): Evan is racing to finish as much of the installer redesign as possible before the sprint.  Parallel debconf and gdk offscreen window work will take place at the sprint.  Currently finishing the automatic partitioning page, then wiring up the timezone page to a local copy of the new geonames service pending IS support.
* UbuntuSpec:foundations-m-package-culling (60%): Several more merges done, and Colin posted an updated list to ubuntu-devel.
* UbuntuSpec:foundations-m-python-versions (15%): Barry scripted a py2.7 archive PPA in ~pythoneers; 2375 successful builds; 90 failed.  Next step is to analyse the failures.
* UbuntuSpec:foundations-m-robust-python-packaging (36%, up from 27%): Versioned .so file proposal working its way through upstream.  Next step is for Barry to write a PEP.
* UbuntuSpec:foundations-m-uefi-support (20%, up from 0%): Learned that UEFI only formally supports 64-bit OSes, so we don't need to worry about the proper grub-efi variant, but can just say that we only support this on amd64.  Other work semi-blocked on UbuntuSpec:foundations-m-cd-boot.

Contributions to other teams:

* UbuntuSpec:arm-m-memory-footprint (100%, up from 0%): Provided pointer to gcc-opt.  Done from our side.

Other work items unchanged from 2010-07-02.

==== 2010-07-02 ====

As predicted, we have a <nowiki>[[http://people.canonical.com/~pitti/workitems/maverick/canonical-foundations-maverick-alpha-3.html|substantial amount of work]]</nowiki> ahead of us for this milestone, so it's just as well that the platform sprint falls in this period.

Our own work:

* UbuntuSpec:foundations-m-686-compile (33%): Spec still undrafted - Matthias has been very busy with Linaro work.
* UbuntuSpec:foundations-m-btrfs-support (0%): Following a decent chunk of support in Alpha 2, Surbhi has been making good progress on the GRUB code and will send upstream for review shortly; she's also looking at adding zlib support to GRUB in order to support compression.  The licensing status is as yet unclear, although there are hopeful signs from btrfs upstream.
* UbuntuSpec:foundations-maverick-buy-something (18%): Michael and Gary met to review the work items yesterday, and Michael reports that this is "looking encouraging".
* UbuntuSpec:foundations-m-cd-boot (0%): Colin is planning to get back to the upstream conversation about this after making some progress on the more important UbuntuSpec:foundations-m-grub2-boot-framebuffer.
* UbuntuSpec:foundations-m-grub2-boot-framebuffer (17%): We have most of the required kernel support for this now, apart from fbcon handoff; it's enough to get started (and has incidentally allowed us to speed up d-i's interface quite a bit).  Colin will start work on this after finishing the next upstream pull into maverick.
* UbuntuSpec:foundations-m-installer-redesign (0%): Notwithstanding the percentage, Evan has the first cut of this on a branch now (<nowiki>[[https://code.launchpad.net/~ev/ubiquity/maverick-redesign|lp:~ev/ubiquity/maverick-redesign]]</nowiki>, and is making steady and substantial progress, including a working wireless network configuration page.
* UbuntuSpec:foundations-m-package-culling (60%): List posted to ubuntu-devel recently, and there's been reasonable progress on stale merges.  Colin will review this shortly.
* UbuntuSpec:foundations-m-python-continuous-integration (0%): Barry has started on this, doing a good deal of testing and working on a package to generate best-practice Python packaging with Debian.
* UbuntuSpec:foundations-m-python-versions (15%): Barry has been working on a Python 2.7 PPA.
* UbuntuSpec:foundations-m-robust-python-packaging (27%): Barry has sent a versioned .so file proposal upstream, which is under discussion.
* UbuntuSpec:foundations-m-uefi-support (0%): Most of the rest of this is semi-blocked on UbuntuSpec:foundations-m-cd-boot.  Colin attended a presentation yesterday and got a contact and some useful information.  Possible modification with some useful risk control: support this only on amd64, since 32-bit UEFI support is strictly unofficial per the specification anyway.

Contributions to other teams:

* UbuntuSpec:arm-m-xdeb-cross-compilation-environment (100%)
* UbuntuSpec:arm-m-memory-footprint (0%)
* UbuntuSpec:arm-m-tool-chain-selection (0%): Test rebuild slipped past alpha-2 due to Launchpad problems; Matthias is actively driving this with Julian Edwards et al.

* UbuntuSpec:desktop-maverick-language-selector-code-changes (100%)
* UbuntuSpec:desktop-maverick-opportunistic-apps-stable-release (100%)

=== RC Milestoned bugs ===

==== Outstanding ====

* Bug:553745 - plymouthd crashed with SIGSEGV in ply_event_loop_process_pending_events()
** No status at this time; assigned to slangasek.
* Bug:610898 - Upgrading Wubi systems from 10.04 LTS is known to fail if Wubi was installed to a partition other than the primary Windows partition, and is not recommended at this time.
** This may or may not be fixable.  When Ubuntu is started via Wubi, only the Windows partition that actually contains the Ubuntu disk images is mounted on `/host`.  `wubildr` needs to go on the C: drive, but it's not clear that we have the information to know where this is.  Windows expert advice welcome.
* Bug:613288 - Wubi Windows installer was reported to be unable to open Windows' boot configuration data store in some (but not all) cases
** We're unlikely to be able to figure out what causes this.  A vague release note warning of possible problems is likely to be the best we can do.
* Bug:625294 - localboot in pxelinux recurses back into pxelinux, and eventually crashes
** Diagnosis in bug report; this is infinite recursion through the PXE stack.  Perhaps a BIOS bug?
* Bug:641259 - grub does not appear to load after maverick post-beta install 
** We can't do much about this remotely.  Marjo has an affected machine and Colin will try to arrange for a last-minute fix at the release sprint.

==== In progress ====

* Bug:642344 - libspring-2.5-java needs an initial manual build
** Considerable progress made on dependencies, though briefly stalled by RC.  Chris Jones is working on the IS side of this.

==== Not critical for release ====

* Bug:635891 - libvigraimpex (main) build-depends on hfd5 (universe)
** Fixed for Maverick.  We're keeping the bug open to evaluate a different approach for Natty, but there's no way to create a Natty task yet.
* Bug:647597 - internal compiler error while building package 'witty'.
** In progress, but it's unlikely to be a good idea to change the toolchain for release at this point.  Targeted for maverick-updates.

==== Fixed or fix-committed ====

* Bug:441941 - grub fails after running Windows
** We now try to avoid certain sectors based on known signatures.  There are still open issues for some people since the signature database isn't complete, so there's no point closing the bug yet since it'll just be reopened, but this is about as good as it's going to get for release.
* Bug:459639 - X server starts randomly in failsafe when starting from cold boot
* Bug:544139 - Active VT tracking can fail at startup
* Bug:569900 - partman creates partitions with ambiguity between whether superblock is on disk device or partition device.
* Bug:605042 - [armel] java fails to start with eglibc-2.12-0ubuntu4
** Nothing left to do for Maverick according to doko, only maverick-updates.  Still a kernel task for lucid.  We have a new and improved buildd which may help.
* Bug:649810: fix for FTBFS
* Bug:651880 - /etc/apt/trusted.gpg is 0600 (should be 644)
