__TOC__


* '''Launchpad Entry''': UbuntuSpec:foundations-lucid-update-manager-debian-improvements
* '''Created''': 2009-11-17
* '''Contributors''': MichaelVogt, SteveLangasek, LoicMinier
* '''Packages affected''': update-manager

=== Status of new tree versus old tree ===

* New version is a clean refactoring with Debian/Ubuntu support
* Some Ubuntu-only fixes in the old tree did not make it to the new tree -- need merging
* Upgrades aren't handled by this tool; need to package Ubuntu's do-release-upgrade in a new source package
* Auto upgrade testing not handled by the tool, needs to go into a seperate 
   source tree
* New tree needs lot of QA in Ubuntu, but has been lightly tested
** We should get a update-manager2 package in universe or in a PPA
* Pretty much complete in terms of frontends

=== Regressions/Bugs in new tree ===

* needs to run a user again (not root, backend specific)
* easier backend support (PK, aptdaemon)
* usability fixes, e.g. button naming and error messages

=== Futuristic stuff ===

* !PackageKit backend

=== Reasons for the new tree ===

* Easier to maintain (cleaner)
* More interest / distros => more maintainers / shared maintenance
* Backend/Distro-agnostic, permits new backends such as !PackageKit

=== Work items ===

Not a replacement for update-manager-1 in lucid; more of a lucid+1 target

1. package update-manager-2 into universe
2. split out release-upgrader from update-manager-1
3. split out auto-ugprade tester from update-manager-1
4. work on backends for update-manager-2 so that it no longer needs root
5. provide meta-release mechanism
6. QA
