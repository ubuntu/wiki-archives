The Good Things That People Need to Know About Ubuntu

The Single Sell approach, which is just common sense in advertising anything. People don't just have short attention spans, they have no attention span and they are bombarded with advertising messages all day, everyday and from every where.

So if you stick to one point, whatever that point is you at least have some chance of reaching them. Now lets create a list of the things that are good about Ubuntu and then expending upon them:

1) Ubuntu is Free

2) Ubuntu is Easy to Use

3) Ubuntu is Fun

4)

5)

6)

7)

Use the topics on this list to write the messages to appear on the fliers in either full letter size of 1/4 letter size format. Postcards are also a good format to use, since you can get postcard forms for your printer at most stationery / office supply stores. One color or "spot" color 1/4 size cards can also be printed by your local print shop by 1000's.
