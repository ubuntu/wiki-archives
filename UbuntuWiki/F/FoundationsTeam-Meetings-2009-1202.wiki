==== Scott James Remnant ====
* Caught up on expenses

* Boot Performance:
** Set up the two Dell Mini 10v netbooks at home to do daily
     bootcharts and installer testing
** Updated BIOS of both and got Wake-On-LAN working to make the
     process completely automated
** Wrote server-side bits to download CD images, update TFTP and NFS
     roots, and wake up the computers in turn to do test installs
** Wrote server-side bits to collect bootcharts and installer logs,
     make some HTML out of them and boot time progress graphs, and
     publish on rookery

* libnih:
** Since this is now in use by multiple pieces of software, finally
     took the step of declaring the current API as a stable one and
     turned it into a separate package of its own that things
     dynamically link to rather than including in their own source trees
** Allocator alignment fix for SPARC
** Updated the suppressions files to work with the latest valgrind,
     and fixed a few test case leaks in the process
** Uploaded to lucid and cowboyed through NEW and into main ;-)
     (the code already entirely exists in main three times <g>)

* ureadahead:
** Ported to external libnih
** Updated packaging to dh 7 now I've learned that
** Fixed apport hook installation
** Uploaded to lucid and cowboyed through NEW and into main ;-)
     (it's already in karmic-updates after all <g>)
** Committed change to the platform seed
     (requires meta update and upload, didn't do one as there hasn't
      been one for lucid yet)
** Removed old sreadahead source from the archive

   Once the new meta package has been uploaded, I can drop the
   transitional binary package for sreadahead 

* mountall:
** Ported to external libnih
** Updated packaging to dh 7 now I've learned that
** Uploaded to lucid (this includes rcS fix that I should prepare a
     karmic-proposed upload for)

* gdm:
** Been tracking a failure to start gdm, especially on HDD machines,
     which I think is caused by races with udev device creation - a more
     precise "start on" line seems to fix it for me.  Will analyse gdm
     and Xorg to make sure I've got it right and upload
     (may be worthy of karmic-proposed upload too)

* bootchart:
** Removed bootchart-java from the archive.  It doesn't work in lucid
     anyway, and the whole world is moving to prefer the Python one
** Updated the python bootchart (pybootchartgui) to SVN trunk, fixes a
     lot of bugs
** Updated bootchart packaging to only recommend pybootchartgui, and
     to Breaks bootchart-java
** Implemented cropping and annotation in pybootchartgui
     (this gets used by the daily bootcharts stuff)
** Updated bootchart package to automatically crop Ubuntu bootcharts
     to avoid the "extra 45s" complaint
** Uploaded updated packages to lucid

   There's an effort upstream to merge an improved version of our
   C-based collector with the Python chart generation into a single
   "bootchart" package: http://github.com/mmeeks/bootchart

   We'll likely adopt this at some point, once I've had a chance to play
   with the taskstats-based collector and see if it works.

==== Steve Langasek ====
one week UDS; one week vacation

===== Release management =====
* continue with lucid archive opening: merges/updates of bsdmainutils,
lintian, emacs-goodies-el, devscripts, cdrom-detect, choose-mirror,
iso-scan, debian-installer-utils, netcfg
* SRU processing

===== Packages =====
* merges/syncs for lucid: jquery, bsd-mailx, cln, db4.6, egenix-mx-base
* fix hdparm to not call hdparm -f for every drive at boot time, slowing
down boot for no reason
