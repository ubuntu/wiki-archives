'''Date and Time:''' Friday, 20 April, 6:30pm
'''Place:''' Dome Cafe, Hillarys Marina (Sorrento Quay)

How to get there: Get on the Freeway towards Hepburn Ave. Get off at Hepburn, and turn toward the West. Follow it around to the end; right in front of you you will see a big sign for Sorrento Quay. At the roundabout, go straight; then turn left into the car park.

Dome Cafe is on the boardwalk part, i.e. the bit that is built over the water itself. You can't miss it.

There will be a couple of Ubuntu Shipit CDs on my table. Bring some money for a coffee and maybe dinner; Dome does a nice dinner!
