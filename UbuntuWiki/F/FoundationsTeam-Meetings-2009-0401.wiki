===== Accessibility =====
* Improved the accessibility setup code in the casper accessibility scripts, making sure Orca exists before creating directories on the installed and live filesystems, as well as making sure PulseAudio exists on the installed/live filesystem before disabling it.
* Added code to copy any changed settings for Orca over to the installed system when the user uses ubiquity to install Ubuntu. This is not done for onboard, since I don't know where it puts its files. Someone who uses onboard will have to let me know.
* Adjusted pulseaudio and casper so that pulseaudio disabling for accessibility reasons is done per user, and not system wide.
* Fix Orca's .desktop file to not display its icon in the applications menus.

===== Audio =====
* Audio bug triaging
* Upload some changes for alsa-driver, alsa-lib, and pulseaudio, thanks to Daniel Chen. Also uploaded the pulseaudio side of the accessibility special case disable code.
* Started preparing a patch to disable the hda beep configuration in the kernel.

===== dmraid =====
* Thanks to the debian dmraid maintainer, got a few critical dmraid fixes fixed in Debian, and got them over to Ubuntu. THings appear to be ok for release, but will do an install test later this week to be sure.

===== Misc =====
* Travel arrangements for Allhands/UDS.
* UbuntuStudio DVD image testing.
* Some more time spent writing accessibility related specs for UDS, as well as working on specs for work that will likely have to be done upstream, to allow the UDS specs to be considered.
