__TOC__

By this date, all features with updates to be landed in `main` for the release must be named and acked by the <nowiki>[[http://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-release|ReleaseTeam]]</nowiki>. Having this freeze gives them a chance to identify any features which should be subject to an earlier PartnerUploadDeadline or FeatureFreeze deadline because they are especially risky. The list of features should be sent to the <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-release|Release Team mailing list]]</nowiki>.
