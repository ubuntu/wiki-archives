__TOC__


This is a brief summary of bugs fixed between Ubuntu 20.04 and 20.04.1.  '''This summary covers only changes to packages in ''__main__'' and ''__restricted__'', which account for all packages in the officially-supported CD images; there are further changes to various packages in ''universe'' and ''multiverse''.'''  Some of these fixes were by Ubuntu developers directly, while others were by upstream developers and backported to Ubuntu.  For full details, see the individual package changelogs.

In addition to the bugs listed below, this update includes all security updates from the <nowiki>[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/releases/ubuntu-20.04-lts/|Ubuntu Security Notice list]]</nowiki> affecting Ubuntu 20.04 LTS that were released up to and including July 29, 2020.  The last update included was USN-4432-1 (GRUB 2 vulnerabilities).

| REGRESSION UPDATE: revert the tmpfiles snippet to do late loading of microcode, this would also happen during package upgrades. Also, in the case of a problematic microcode update, this would prevent booting using an earlier kernel as the late loading would still load the problematic micrcode, forcing the use of the 'dis_ucode_ldr' kernel command line option to recover.

| memcached
| Bug:1878721
| d/p/fix-bug-where-sasl-will-load-config-the-wrong-path.patch: Fix the path from which SASL configuration is loaded.   The bug happened because sasl expects memcached to provide a path (i.e., a directory, not a filename) where the sasl configuration file(s) is (are).  However, memcached was passing the filename (/etc/sasl2/memcached.conf) to sasl, which was interpreting it as a directory, and looking for a configuration file inside it (i.e., /etc/sasl2/memcached.conf/memcached.conf). Users could workaround this bug by creating a directory named /etc/sasl2/memcached.conf/, and putting the configuration file inside it.  This patch not only fixes this bug (by passing the right directory, /etc/sasl2/, to sasl) but also supports the workaround described above.
