'''Florida Team Birthday Bash'''

Florida Team Wiki <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FloridaTeam/Projects/FlocoBday09|Birthday Link]]</nowiki> 

This was originally planned to happen on September 27^th^, but so many things have been going on. We decided as a Team that November 7th would be the best rain check date. In honor of the Loco's 'birthday' (the day we were officially recognized as an Ubuntu Loco ) and the Karmic Koala Release - we're having a BBQ! This is graciously being hosted at the Hall's Residence. Please see the Birthday Bash wiki link for further details, and please if you plan to go (which the more the merrier) RSVP on the <nowiki>[[http://www.meetup.com/Tampa-Linux/calendar/10712190|meetup.com link]]</nowiki> .

From the <nowiki>[[http://www.floridalinuxshow.com/|Florida Linux Show]]</nowiki> website:
  The third Florida Linux Show 2009 will be held in the entertainment capital of Florida in the great city of Orlando.  A vacation hot spot because of Disney , UNIVERSAL , and Sea World , Orlando, like Jacksonville with its dedicated Linux users and city population deserves a world class Linux & Open Source Software conference and exhibit. The Florida Linux Show 2009 Orlando will be tapping into the Tampa, St. Petersburg, Miami, Melbourne, and Orlando LUG's for their Linux attendee base.
