=== Specification & Design ===
* Greeter needs to be fully themeable.

** Panel
** Decorate using image (e.g. /usr/share/lightdm-greeter-gtk/images/panel.png)
** Orientation (top/bottom) needs to be configurable (greeter.conf)

** Window
** Inherited from GTK theme (greeter.conf)

** Icons
** Inherited from icon theme (greeter.conf)
** Special icons (if any are used) needs to be changeable (e.g. /usr/share/lightdm-greeter-gtk/images/...)

* Panel lacks features and should take a page from unity-greeter which has a far more usability.
** Add volume indicator
** Add computer name
** Add keyboard layout indicator
** Add clock indicator

* Add a face browser to the greeter.

==== Discussion / Comments ====
* I'm not sure the tabs really work for listing users, at least it seems very un-intuitive to me. What I liked about the previous, more sketchy mockup, was that the computer name went into the otherwise rather empty panel and that the login-box was kinda reduced in complexity and size. Now it contains lots of widgets and elements again. ''--Simon''
