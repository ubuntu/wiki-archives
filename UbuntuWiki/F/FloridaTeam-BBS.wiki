=== NOTICE ===

The BBS is down for an undetermined amount of time.  I may make an HTTP mirror for files, but thats about it.

== The Florida Team's BBS ==

Contact me, <nowiki>[[Catsceo]]</nowiki>, for the IP/pass for the server on the #ubuntu-us-fl channel on freenode.

Documentation on login info and login options is located <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=523654|here]]</nowiki>

Documentation on how to use the server will be located on it when you login.

==== Login ====

I made a bash script (located <nowiki>[[ftp:--catsceo.servebbs.net|here]]</nowiki> ) that will ssh to the BBS, but you still need to get the pass from me.

=== Rules ===

1. Show common courtesy when using this service.
2. Do not erase stuff.
3. Do '''not''' put illegal or inappropriate stuff on the server.
