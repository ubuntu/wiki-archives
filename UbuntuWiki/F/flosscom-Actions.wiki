~+'''Summer University Organizational Actions'''+~

== Ubuntu forums ==

It would be beneficial to have category / section on: “Learning the open source way” - where could / should this be located at the forum to get attention?

== Promotion ==

How can the summer university be best promoted within Ubuntu?

The press release and an initial presentation are available here:
http://flosscom.net/index.php?option=com_docman&task=cat_view&gid=28&Itemid=116

== Loco teams ==

How to best get in contact with the loco teams and to raise their awareness on the fact that they are welcome to participate at (or organize) On-Campus events? 

== Ubuntu Wiki WYSIWYG editor ==

I saw at the link below that there would be a wysiwyg option using the FCK editor for the moinmoin wiki that Ubuntu uses - does Ubuntu intends to install it?
