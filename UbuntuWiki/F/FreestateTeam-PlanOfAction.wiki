== The Free State Team's Plan of Action ==

=== Taking the baby steps ===

 1. Locate and gather team members and Ubuntu users, and make efforts to ensure that team members are spread over as many geographical locations as possible within the Free State, to maximise the effects of our efforts. <<BR>>
 2. Establish a list of tasks and responsibilities that team members will be responsible for and assign these to members based on their own personal interests and what they are comfortable doing. <<BR>>
 3. Elect a Team Leader, if it is decided by the team that this is necessary (having a Team Leader is optional). <<BR>>
 4. Elect a Team Contact (this is required). <<BR>>

=== Proposed Tasks and Responsibilities ===
