This page is dedicated to Ubuntu participation at Fosdem 2013

If you are somebody contributing to Ubuntu in any way (ranging from providing support on your locoteam forum or IRC channel, to being a core developer), please register your attendance <nowiki>[[Fosdem-2013#Ubuntu_Developers.2C_Contributors.2C_etc.|below]]</nowiki>!

We will have a booth with volunteers from Ubuntu-be + whomever wants to help.

== Ubuntu Dinner ==

We want to have an Ubuntu dinner on Saturday night with Ubuntu-be volunteers and other Ubuntu contributors (including employees of Canonical & other companies related to Ubuntu, of course!).  The list below is preliminary; we will have a list at the booth of who really wants to come with us on Saturday (please don't forget to put yourself on the list then!).

=== Who is interested in coming to the dinner ===

== Ubuntu Developers, Contributors, etc. ==

It's quite common for upstream developers & developers from other distros to ask us at the Ubuntu booth if $UBUNTU_DEVELOPER_X or $AN_UBUNTU_DEVELOPER_FAMILIAR_WITH_Y is at FOSDEM, and often we don't know the answer.  Because of that, it would be cool if Ubuntu developers who come to FOSDEM could somehow list when/where they can be found during FOSDEM...

Of course, if you give a talk, please also mention this in the appropriate section!
