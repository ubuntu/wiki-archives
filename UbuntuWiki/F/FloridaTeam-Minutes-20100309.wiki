[19:09:38] <itnet7> [LINK] https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FloridaTeam/ReapprovalApplication2010
[19:09:49] <itnet7> Here is our current Re-Approval Wiki
[19:10:33] <itnet7> If anyone feels that they have something that they would like to add, that may be missing. or that we may have forgotten feel free, try to keep the same format wherever possible
[19:11:13] <itnet7> I would encourage everyone that is in this channel to try their best to attend, in support of dantalizing and our team!
[19:11:47] <itnet7> I can't represent the team, because I am a member of the LoCo Council

[19:16:45] <itnet7> [TOPIC] Help Wanted!

[19:18:04] <itnet7> and such
[19:18:14] <itnet7> thanks jamesrfla !

[19:18:29] <jamesrfla> kk
[19:18:41] <itnet7> [ACTION] jamesrfla> I can help with the mailing list. I already moderate one
[19:19:47] <itnet7> The team reports are great resource for encouraging other LoCo's
[19:20:09] <itnet7> are 'a'
[19:21:09] <itnet7> so I will start adding more relevent stuff to the Help Wanted area soon, please check and see if there is anything you may feel like helping with!
[19:21:18] <habanero_joe> Great idea
[19:21:30] <itnet7> [TOPIC] Open Discussion!

[19:22:24] <himuraken> I do.
[19:22:33] <itnet7> go ahead himuraken !
[19:22:34] <himuraken> Where does everyone stand on the global jams?
[19:23:05] <itnet7> himuraken: that's a good question!
[19:23:17] <himuraken> I am willing to help get one going in SWFL if anyone is willing to attend. Note* First timer.
[19:23:27] <himuraken> I can probably con habanero_joe into it as well.
[19:23:37] <habanero_joe> affirmative
[19:23:46] <himuraken> /con
[19:24:02] <jamesrfla> I am in SWFL
[19:24:07] <itnet7> I am going to be in Utah from the 21st to the 26th
[19:24:17] <itnet7> I was planning to try and come by
[19:24:30] <himuraken> itnet7, you are north right?
[19:24:32] <itnet7> govatent: ?
[19:24:42] <itnet7> himuraken: yeah, but I like to drive, it keeps me sane!
[19:24:43] <itnet7> :-)
[19:24:47] <habanero_joe> lol
[19:25:08] <himuraken> The only concern I have, as previously stated. I have never even attended one, but I have the space and connections etc.
[19:25:14] <crashsystems> you mean, there is someone other than me that lives in north florida?
[19:25:28] <DammitJim> evening all
[19:25:35] <jamesrfla> I live in North Fort Myers
[19:25:37] <itnet7> **clarification I don't really live in NORTH Florida
[19:25:38] <habanero_joe> hello Dammit
[19:25:43] <itnet7> only Melbourne...
[19:25:47] <DammitJim> habanero_joe, are you in Miami?
[19:25:52] <itnet7> 1/2 up the east coast!
[19:25:56] <himuraken> thats just racist!
[19:26:00] <himuraken> DammitJim,
[19:26:06] <crashsystems> 5 seconds after trying to use it, and pitivi already fails
[19:26:12] <himuraken> govatent, ping! had mentioned that he would come across from the east coast I beleive.
[19:26:25] <crashsystems> "an error has occurred while importing." won't even tell me _what_ error
[19:26:30] <itnet7> DammitJim: is Ecuadorian i doubt he's racist!
[19:26:33] <itnet7> :-)
[19:26:35] <DammitJim> shush
[19:26:45] <DammitJim> brb
[19:27:51] <crashsystems> anyone know why pitivi would not import an mpg video?
[19:28:00] <itnet7> Let me see what I can do about getting you in contact with ropetin
[19:28:24] <itnet7> and we can try and talk with govatent and try to put something together
[19:28:44] <himuraken> itnet7, who is this mysterious ropetin ?
[19:28:48] <itnet7> ROFL
[19:28:59] <itnet7> he lives in Miami/Ft. Lauderdale
[19:29:12] <himuraken> K
[19:29:14] <itnet7> He organized a Jaunty Release party in Ft. Lauderdale
[19:29:38] <habanero_joe> I'm in Fort Myers
[19:29:52] <crashsystems> Who needs a functioning GUI video editor to replace the Gimp when we can just use ffmpeg? At least that works once you spend 45 minutes reading the man page.
[19:29:57] <jamesrfla> I am too.....Just North Fort Myers
[19:30:02] <crashsystems>
[19:30:21] <itnet7> igorgue is from Miami, RoAkSoAx is too
[19:30:27] <habanero_joe> So three people in Lee County so far
[19:30:29] <itnet7> so is erictee !
[19:30:40] <himuraken> Perhaps, at the very least, habanero_joe, jamesrfla , and I can get together and have a mini n00bJam
[19:30:53] <himuraken> habanero_joe, I am sure KiddAMD will go, so we have 4 in Lee County.
[19:30:57] <habanero_joe> lol n00bJam...
[19:31:01] <jamesrfla> other people in lee county. When I joined there was nobody near me that was part of this team
[19:31:10] <itnet7> let me see how far Lee County is from Brevard!
[19:31:27] <himuraken> zip is 33919 for mtg place.
[19:31:31] <habanero_joe> >2 hours
[19:32:43] <itnet7> 178 mi  about 4 hours 2 mins
[19:32:50] <erictee> Yes, I am in North broward, however i will be in Jamaica 03/25 thru 04/02
[19:32:52] <itnet7> not really 4 hours I'm sure
[19:33:04] <itnet7> erictee: Nice!!
[19:33:23] <habanero_joe> 1.5 hours in Cessna...
[19:33:38] <erictee> i am still willing to help
[19:34:59] <habanero_joe> I think four people is certainly good to get something started?
[19:35:00] <itnet7> Let's see how things work out!
[19:35:12] <itnet7> Defnitely habanero_joe !
[19:35:13] <himuraken> jamesrfla, have you done any bug triage or docu yet?
[19:35:23] <jamesrfla> No I have not
[19:35:43] <itnet7> himuraken: were you planning on Sat and Sun or just Sat?
[19:36:04] <himuraken> One day, sat or sun is fine by me.
[19:36:15] <itnet7> Hey there dorgan !
[19:36:25] <dorgan> hola
[19:36:36] <himuraken> I think Saturday would be best. Does that work for you haba and jamesrfla ?
[19:36:37] <DammitJim> ok, so what was racist?
[19:36:53] <dorgan> itnet7: how you been
[19:36:54] <habanero_joe> SO FAR the calendar is clear for 3/28

[19:38:26] <jamesrfla> himuraken: I would have to change my work day from Saturday to Sunday and then I am not sure how my parents will be about going over a strangers house I met online
[19:38:47] <habanero_joe> hmmm

[19:39:25] <himuraken> habanero_joe, yep.
[19:39:35] <jamesrfla> oh a office. Well then that might be better
[19:39:47] <crashsystems> Looks like gstreamer does not work for editing mpeg files. I wonder if there are any camcorders that do not use mpeg.
[19:40:43] <itnet7> crashsystems: I am surprised you are having so many problems with pitivi
[19:40:48] <jamesrfla> himuraken: I can probably come. Just tell me where and when and I should be able to come. Have to get my parents to get me a ride to that office
[19:40:54] <crashsystems> have you had better luck?
