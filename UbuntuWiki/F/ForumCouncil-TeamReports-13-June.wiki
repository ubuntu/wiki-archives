An update from the Forums Council for June of 2013

We had a rather short meeting this month, and there weren't any issues that needed tending to, except the revised CofC.

Elfy has revised the forum Code of Conduct and the posting guidelines, we expect them to go live on July the 1st, 2013.

The only other item this month, was the division of the various task we do to keep the forum running from day to day.
