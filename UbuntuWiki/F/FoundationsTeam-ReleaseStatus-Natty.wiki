=== Weekly summary ===

==== 2011-01-28 ====

* Ratings & reviews has landed in Software Center for natty <code>\o/</code>
* Python 2.7 transition is going well.  
** There are still a <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bugs?field.tag=python27|few minor bugs]]</nowiki> still open and tagged with ''python27'', but progress is good on fixing these.  
** No known main packages still depending on Python<2.7.  
** Test installation of main packages with Depends: python in progress (finds packages with non-build related incompatibilities).
* upstart
** jhunt: upstart work mostly done, waiting for scott's blessing; 
** a fix is working for top upstart bug 672177 (affects natty, maverick, lucid)
* two usb-creator bugs fixes; annoying but biting lots of people

==== 2011-01-21 ====

Good feature progress at the rally; very little visible progress since then unfortunately (although mvo's been at another sprint, and a lot of the remaining work items are his).  Several of the in-progress items are nearing completion though.

Interesting feature progress this week that isn't showing up:
* LibreOffice -> natty
* evaluating multiple test rebuilds, including one for gcc-4.6 (http://people.ubuntuwire.org/~wgrant/rebuild-ftbfs-test/test-rebuild-20110111-gcc-natty.html)
* fixed some of the graphical boot problems identified at the rally
* processing review feedback on upstart override handling
* started on upstart job visualisation work
* working on setting up easily snapshottable btrfs snapshots in installer by default

==== 2010-12-17 ====

* Matthias asked me to pass on this Python update:
** <doko> python2.7: the archive should be in a state where it is upgradable without removing any packages (except for a handful).
** <doko> people upgrading from maverick should first upgrade to -updates
** <doko> people upgrading from early natty should be aware of https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/python2.7/+bug/689306
** <doko> I plan to send a followup on the python upgrade this weekend
** <doko> outstanding packages are: ethos, gapti, python-drizzle, python-hildon (removal request filed), xen-3.3
** <doko> the next step would be looking at packages which only depend on python2.6/libpython2.6 and address these
** <doko> after that, we could try to remove 2.6, or delay that for the sprint
* Other feature news this week:
** GRUB should now be picking a better resolution and setting a background colour that matches plymouth; blacklist infrastructure is waiting in NEW; text-free boot should now be well on its way
** debconf ported to GtkAssistant, getting rid of libgnome2-perl (thanks janimo and pitti)
** component-mismatches looking much cleaner now than last week
** new upstart release: manual stanza, debug stanza, new properties to support bridges and visualisation, new signals to support plymouth integration
** on their way: socket activation (draft code), chroot and user sessions (draft code), override files (WIP)

==== 2010-12-10 ====

* excellent progress on installer testing by Evan, now running regularly and soon going to gain things like bootchart support (though public viewing blocked by RT#40560)
* significant software-center speed improvements, large searches from ~5s to instant
* changelogs.ubuntu.com now updates more or less instantly
* <nowiki>[[https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/packageselection-foundations-n-finish-upstart|natty upstart spec]]</nowiki> belatedly finalised: planned improvements are debug stanza, override files (with manual stanza for disabling  jobs), job visualisation, socket activation, D-Bus activation, chroot support, user sessions, and visible job start/stop in plymouth details view
* Qt builds on ARM again, thanks to gcc fix
* python2.7 now default version, working through build failures

=== RC Milestoned bugs ===

Alpha-2 bugs:
* Bug:675347: in progress upstream (Linaro)
* Bug:680328: can't reproduce, asked for test sequence
* Bug:684052: Evan said at the rally that this would be easy; poked him again
* Bug:684703: have checked with doko, although I think this has been worked around; marked incomplete for now
* Bug:686263: looks to me like only ubuntu-mir members can get anywhere with this; commented asking for clarification

Alpha-3 bugs:
* Bug:664276, Bug:664397: no status at this time; will ask Barry about it after alpha-2
* Bug:691671: patch doesn't fix the bug; Evan has followed up saying so; needs more work, marked for alpha-3

Beta-1 bugs:
* Bug:553745: still no information, as Scott said previous attempts to fix have made it worse; won't rush this one, so pushed to beta-1
* Bug:645818: this should be tractable, but we released maverick with this so pushed to beta-1
* Bug:671016: just a website change now, pushed to beta-1
* Bug:690873: can safely be left for beta-1 at this point, per its milestone

Unmilestoned bugs:
* Bug:684083: can't reproduce on my nvidia hardware, asked reporter to confirm; could be system-specific
