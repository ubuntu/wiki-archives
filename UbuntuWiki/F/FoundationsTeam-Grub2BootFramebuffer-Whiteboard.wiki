__TOC__

== Changes in Natty ==

* `gfxpayload=keep` (disable with `GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX=text`)
* `vt.handoff=7` (not easily disableable)
* VBE autodetect (disable with `GRUB_GFXMODE=640x480`)

== Problems ==

* Intractable black screen, even when all the above turned off
** Solution: Send upstream, to go with other similar bugs

* Black (or occasionally purple) panel unless `gfxpayload=text`
** Blacklist PCI IDs / BIOSes / etc.
** Run through certification lab
