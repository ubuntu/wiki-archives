Hi, I'm Ubuntu User since 5.04 :-) and former Gentoo evangelist, until compiling everything started to annoy me...

I have some ideas for ubuntu/debian in general, and would like to help reorganizing this wiki...
I'm managing a few wikis at the moment, and I do this, cause I like structuring everything so that users can easily browse through the pages. I'm kind of a perfectionist ;-).
