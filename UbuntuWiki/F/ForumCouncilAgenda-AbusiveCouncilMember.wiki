I believe that council member bodhi.zazen has abused his authority and needs reprimanded and his actions reversed.

I saw someone else have their thread closed last week, in what I believe to be a misapplication of forum policy.  I started a thread in the resolution center to point out that the activity in question is not actually illegal, and therefore, discussing it does not violate the forum policy.

Rather than rebut my argument, Bodhi.zazen chose to threaten me with being banned from the forums just for discussing it.  I pointed out that discussing the proper application of the CoC can not be misconstrued as violating the CoC, and that his threats were unbecoming of his office.  He then followed through on the threats.  You can see the discussion here:

I stand behind bodhi.zazen as he is moderator, and did the right thing. I would have banned you as well, simply because of you biting, fault-finding, sarcastic manner. It's a pity to see your beans burning, but bodhi.zazen is NOT abusive. You were abusive in that thread.
