** Documentation: add --arch to the man page
** Update ACPI RSDP tests to be specification compliant
** RSDP: minor cleanups to rsdp.c for checkpatch issues
** utilities: add a helper function for printing out architecture names
** ACPI tables: when bodging up an RSDP, do the right thing for the arch
** ACPI RSDP: flesh out the tests to check for full spec compliance.
