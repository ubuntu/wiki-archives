* <yourname> This is how I feel. This is a solution I see.

'''Teaker1s''' what I would like to point out is that I would like the future of the Backyard given discussion time and my position is as outlined in the thread.

What I'm keen for is a solution for everyone, moderators who are not keen on Backyard given back their time to spend on area's they find productive. Virtually no moderation,Backyard users given the ability to speak their mind-provided it is a well constructed reasoned reply.

As another point I would be willing to assist in backyard moderation-if the forums are struggling to find moderators keen to do it.
