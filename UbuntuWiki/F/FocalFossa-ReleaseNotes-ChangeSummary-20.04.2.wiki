__TOC__


This is a brief summary of bugs fixed between Ubuntu 20.04.1 and 20.04.2.  '''This summary covers only changes to packages in ''__main__'' and ''__restricted__'', which account for all packages in the officially-supported CD images; there are further changes to various packages in ''universe'' and ''multiverse''.'''  Some of these fixes were by Ubuntu developers directly, while others were by upstream developers and backported to Ubuntu.  For full details, see the individual package changelogs.

In addition to the bugs listed below, this update includes all security updates from the <nowiki>[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/releases/ubuntu-20.04-lts/|Ubuntu Security Notice list]]</nowiki> affecting Ubuntu 20.04 LTS that were released up to and including February 3, 2021.  The last update included was USN-4720-1 (Apport vulnerabilities).

=== Installation bug fixes ===

Updated CD images are provided with this release, including fixes for some installation bugs.  (Many installation problems are hardware-specific; for those, see "Hardware support bugs" below.)

|-
| grub2
| Bug:1891680
| postinst.in: do not exit successfully when failing to show critical grub-pc/install_devices_failed and grub-pc/install_devices_empty prompts in non-interactive mode. This enables surfacing upgrade errors to the users and/or automation.
|-
| grub2

| Bug:1892526
| postinst.in: Fixup postinst.in, to attempt grub-install upon explicit dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc.
|-

| ubiquity
| Bug:1914091
| install_misc: Mark all installed packages as manually installed.  When we're marking packages to install, mark them as `from_user=True`, which means manually installed. This prevents them being autoremoved either during installation or afterwards in the target system.  Fixes removal of the OEM kernel resulting in unbootable certified systems.

=== Upgrade bug fixes ===

These changes fix upgrade issues, smoothing the way for future upgrades to later releases of Ubuntu.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| unattended-upgrades

|-
| ubuntu-release-upgrader
| Bug:1888916
| DistUpgrade/DistUpgradeController.py: do what the comment says and really back up /etc/apt/sources.list first.
|-
| ubuntu-release-upgrader
| Bug:1887544
| DistUpgrade/DistUpgradeQuirks.py: In addition to quirking python-minimal we also need to quirk python-dbg, python-doc, and python-dev.
|-
| ubuntu-release-upgrader

|-
| ubuntu-release-upgrader
| Bug:1897778
| DistUpgrade/DistUpgradeController.py: release cache lock during runPostInstallScripts
|-
| ubuntu-release-upgrader
| Bug:1848829
| DistUpgrade/dist-upgrade.py: When running the release upgrade do not add user site directory to sys.path thereby preventing user python packages from interfering with the upgrade process.
|-
| update-notifier
| Bug:1901627
| data/apt_check.py: Update UA Infra: ESM product name and doc url
|-
| update-notifier
| Bug:1908050
| List OEM metapackages before invoking update-manager. Before invoking update-manager, run a helper script to figure out if there are any oem-*-meta packages which apply to this system. These are enablement packages maintained by Canonical which install any tweaks required by a particular piece of hardware. The script takes care to exit quickly if it's been run before or if the system is already enabled. It uses ubuntu-drivers' python interface, so we need to add a dependency to make sure that is available.There will be a companion change in update-manager to consume this list.
|-
| update-manager
| Bug:1902025
| UpdateManager/Core/UpdateList.py: change to a regex from a static list of packages to be grouped under Ubuntu Base
|-
| update-manager
| Bug:1908050
| Support post install enablement of OEM-enabled devices
|-
| update-notifier
| Bug:1912496
| control: Move ubuntu-drivers-common dep to update-notifier. It's only needed when launching update-manager, which happens from /usr/bin/update-notifier which is in the update-notifier package. Having it in update-notifier-common causes ubuntu-drivers-common and all its deps to be pulled in on all flavours, even ones without update-manager.
|-
| update-manager
| Bug:1913732
| UpdateManager/backend/__init__.py: Really make commit_oem a no-op in the base class to avoid crash when people force synaptic backend
|-
| update-manager
| Bug:1912718
| Revert previous change to UpdateList.py, as it breaks kernel autoremoval
|-
| update-manager
| Bug:1913732

| Bug:1901548
| Don't cast a GtkLabel into a GisSnapTile. We populate a GtkFlowBox with tiles representing features snaps. There might not be exactly enough to fill up the entire number of rows, so the remaining cells are filled up with blank space, which is actually a GtkLabel. When clicking these tiles, we launch Software to the application that's been clicked. That is done by looking inside the tile to find its associated snap. We try to do this 'looking inside' for the blank tiles too. But they aren't snaps at all - as mentioned above, they are GtkLabels. We illegally cast to a snap tile, and then operate on it. At best, this leads to a warning on stderr and Software getting spawned to display a nonsense application. At worst we crash. Fix this by altering the callback to check if we have clicked on a snap or not. In the not case, simply return and do nothing.

| initramfs-tools
| Bug:1879987
| scripts/functions: Prevent printf error carry over if the wrong console is set.  The function _log_msg() is "void" typed, returning whatever its last command returns. This function is the basic building block for all error/warning messages in initramfs-tools. If a bad console is provided to kernel on command-line, printf returns error, and so this error is carried over in _log_msg(). Happens that checkfs() function has a loop that runs forever in this scenario (*if* fsck is not present in initramfs and "quiet" is not passed in the command-line). If that happens, boot is stuck and cannot progress. The simple fix hereby merged is to return zero on _log_msg().
|-
| initramfs-tools
| Bug:1879980
| scripts/local: Re-execute cryptroot local-block script.  Currently, if an encrypted rootfs is configured on top of a MD RAID1 array and such array gets degraded (like a member is removed/failed), initramfs-tools cannot mount the rootfs and the boot fails. We fix that issue here by allowing cryptroot script to re-run on local-block stage, given that mdadm is able to activate a degraded array in that point. There is a cryptsetup counter-part for this fix, but alone the initramfs-tools portion is innocuous.
