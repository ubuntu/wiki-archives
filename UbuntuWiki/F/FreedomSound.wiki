hu.. Hello :)

At first, Sorry for my poor English. 
So, I'm french, I'm twenty-two and I live near Grenoble.

I love Ubuntu & I want to distribute it !

I want to change the world by put it inside my life.

And so, I want to offer to other poeple, like my friends, the chance to be in right with their "free-mind" by using Ubuntu instead of Microsoft Windows when they are typing a simple text document, listening to music or watching some pictures.

I really think that Ubuntu can become the other OS installed on computer instead of Windows over the world.

By what I see and by what I feel, I believe in Ubuntu and this community

Best regards,

Freedom Sound.
