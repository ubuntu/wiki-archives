(08:16:52 PM) bordy: it means, theoretically, easier access to materials.

(08:16:59 PM) bordy: CDs, shirts, etc.

(08:17:05 PM) ***ElementC7 thanks cats

(08:17:10 PM) bordy: in truth, most likely not. However, it does mean we get a hosted website

(08:17:18 PM) Catsceo: pak33m: oh crap I always miss those meetings

(08:17:27 PM) bordy: so anyone who has nay experience with drupal, please lemme know soon

(08:17:53 PM) reya276: sweet, so basicly is what I had asked before, better marketing materials

(08:18:18 PM) reya276: what is dupral bordy

(08:18:18 PM) bordy: pretty much. We're able to request larger shipments of CDs and whatnot, and we are given a site

(08:18:21 PM) itnet7: that means none right ??

(08:18:22 PM) itnet7: j/k

(08:18:29 PM) bordy: a CMS reya276

(08:18:38 PM) reya276: oops drupal

(08:18:41 PM) Catsceo: anybody got a link to the #ubuntu-meeting schedule?

(08:18:52 PM) reya276: oh kind'a like joomla

(08:18:55 PM) bordy: catsceo: check fridge.ubuntu.com

(08:19:12 PM) reya276: yeah I saw that this afternoon

(08:19:27 PM) reya276: that's alot of meetings

(08:19:40 PM) reya276: I don't know if I can make it every single time

(08:20:04 PM) reya276: sorry, for the complaint

(08:20:33 PM) pak33m: sorry everybody i forgot to get you all to the agenda topics for this meeting are here https://
wiki.ubuntu.com/FloridaTeam/Meetings

(08:20:51 PM) pak33m: i will go through them right down the list

(08:20:53 PM) bordy has changed the topic to: TOPIC: "Event/meeting planning... team google calendar, or fridge?"

(08:21:00 PM) Catsceo: can we subscribe to ubuntu meetings thru webcal://?

(08:21:17 PM) pak33m: bordy: you wanna discuss what well has been discussed about this topic

(08:21:43 PM) ElementC7: (back in a few yall)

(08:21:47 PM) bordy: sure. I made a gcal for the team befor realizing that Ubuntu-US also has one, and we are able 
to use the fridge...

(08:21:50 PM) bordy: BUT

(08:22:18 PM) bordy: the US-teams google calendar is seemingly poorly maintained, since I am unable to find who runs 
it, and it is CHOCK FULL of stuff, clutting up my thunderbird

(08:22:30 PM) bordy: and the fridge, well, none of us have write access so would have to ask to have things put on 
it for us

(08:22:50 PM) bordy: whereas a team google calendar I can give people write access, and we can add/edit meetings and 
other such events

(08:22:58 PM) bordy: So I put it to yall

(08:23:16 PM) Catsceo: I say gcal if it has webcal://

(08:23:29 PM) pak33m: bordy: i believe its is dshfuel1 cuz he set me with admin to the us teams gcal

(08:23:33 PM) bordy: I am not clear on webcal://

(08:23:39 PM) itnet7: If your going to use drupal doesn't it include it's own prebuilt calendering prog?

(08:23:46 PM) reya276: as long as I can sink it with evolution it's all good

(08:23:52 PM) pak33m: do we want a gcal for just our events/projects, etc?

(08:23:56 PM) bordy: Personally, I think the US Teams calendar has far too much on there

(08:24:11 PM) bordy: it would be fine if thats all you are following, but I personally have like 6 calendars

(08:24:36 PM) pak33m: bordy: im just following the us teams gcal for us teams reporting

(08:25:01 PM) pak33m: can we all agree to have a gcal for our own events/projects, etc?

(08:25:06 PM) Catsceo: hmm

(08:25:23 PM) bordy: I'm down. I think it avoids confusion and allows us to write to our own calendar

(08:25:27 PM) Catsceo: you mean personal ones?

(08:25:31 PM) itnet7: cat research gcal to see if it supports webcal then vote ;-)

(08:25:44 PM) pak33m: Catsceo: no, for the team only

(08:25:54 PM) Catsceo: I can create webcals with iCal + .Mac

(08:26:04 PM) ElementC7: shut up mac god

(08:26:09 PM) itnet7: rofl

(08:26:15 PM) ElementC7: Were not all that fortunate

(08:26:21 PM) bordy: fortunate?

(08:26:26 PM) ElementC7: besitdes, this is a LINUX user group

(08:26:26 PM) ***Catsceo throws Vista at ElementC7

(08:26:33 PM) itnet7: we are fortunate... we don't use macs!

(08:26:35 PM) ***ElementC7 is hurt deeply

(08:26:38 PM) itnet7: ;-)

(08:26:48 PM) Catsceo: yes I know, I tend to use what I've got

(08:26:57 PM) pak33m: for now we could all use the gcal until we get something else going

(08:27:03 PM) bordy: Alright, I need some input here, cause if we are going to go with a team cal, I need to put the 
email back out, cause the addresses changed

(08:27:03 PM) ElementC7: that works for me

(08:27:07 PM) pak33m: woudl everybody agree to that

(08:27:11 PM) itnet7: I think gcal would be a good thing

(08:27:21 PM) ElementC7: gcal = good

(08:27:24 PM) bordy: Alright, good. I will put the email out after the meeting

(08:27:33 PM) reya276: gcal is good

(08:27:36 PM) Catsceo: ok, I'll roll with it

(08:27:42 PM) pak33m: bordy: are you tasked to the gcal?

(08:27:50 PM) bordy has changed the topic to: TOPIC: Gutsy Release Party

(08:28:00 PM) bordy: I am, you, martinmwilson, and statik already have access

(08:28:04 PM) ElementC7: party?

(08:29:19 PM) ElementC7: cats: gUTsy

(08:29:23 PM) Catsceo: it looks like gcal does support webcal://

(08:29:29 PM) pak33m: this would be a great thing for our team to make considering that we just got approved!!

(08:29:30 PM) ElementC7: not gUSty

(08:29:30 PM) reya276: it's pretty good as is right now, so I can't wait to the official release

(08:42:44 PM) TonyM2: So, Rachel's in Orlando then? ;)

(08:43:54 PM) itnet7: omg...

(08:44:03 PM) itnet7: if it's there I can't/wont go

(08:44:15 PM) reya276: nah dude, that was Mike and he's no longer part of the team

(08:44:15 PM) ElementC7: couldn't

(08:44:41 PM) bordy: new topic?

(08:44:52 PM) ElementC7: sounds goodf

(08:44:52 PM) pak33m: itnet7: im trying to gauge where we would want to have diff meetups

(08:44:52 PM) Catsceo: yes

(08:44:59 PM) pak33m: bordy: yes

(08:45:01 PM) bordy has changed the topic to: TOPIC: Discuss how to get in contact with local teens: Linux-only LAN 
Parties have been very successful in ElementC's experience

(08:45:05 PM) ElementC7: well continue the party planning after the meeting

(08:45:06 PM) TonyM2: itnet7 just kidding.. :)

(08:45:12 PM) ElementC7: rihgt...

(08:45:15 PM) bordy: elementC7: youre up

(08:45:16 PM) ElementC7: just that

(08:45:20 PM) pak33m: ElementC7: did you put this topic up?

(08:45:31 PM) dantalizing: pls refresh your agenda

(08:45:33 PM) Catsceo: I'm starting a club at my school, details in at 11

(08:45:36 PM) dantalizing: i just updated

(08:45:36 PM) Catsceo: :P

(08:45:48 PM) bordy: well you two are our resident teens

(08:45:49 PM) ElementC7: had a few linux only lan parties at my school, they had a mildly successful turnout

(08:46:25 PM) ElementC7: If we could perhaps do something a little bigger (at barcamp+1?) it could be pretty epic

(08:46:31 PM) itnet7: Seriously... I can ask my director if we can host the Gutsy fest in our building if it's our 
way... Rockledge is closer for most than melbourne

(08:46:40 PM) ElementC7: but that's really it, just something to note.

(08:47:00 PM) bordy: elementC7: maybe you and catsceo should get together and talk about some of this stuff :)

(08:47:09 PM) reya276: where is Rockledge

(08:47:16 PM) ElementC7: google it.

(08:47:25 PM) pak33m: ElementC7: Catsceo: can you add this to https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FloridaTeam/Projects so we can 
follow

(08:47:26 PM) itnet7: close to kennedy space center  and cocoa

(08:47:29 PM) Catsceo: google earth it

(08:47:44 PM) reya276: ok good for me

(08:47:44 PM) ElementC7: will do

(08:47:56 PM) ElementC7: ready to topic switch

(08:48:03 PM) Catsceo: same here

(08:48:04 PM) TonyM2: Rockledge is just south of Cocoa.

(08:48:21 PM) bordy has changed the topic to: TOPIC: Projects page and proposed projects

(08:48:51 PM) pak33m: im going to discuss this briefly and get back to dant's topic

(08:49:15 PM) bordy: I skipped dant's topic cause we already touched on it during the approval topic

(08:49:27 PM) bordy: but forgot we need to decide which way to go

(08:49:34 PM) bordy: so we should go back, and I am a bad person

(08:49:37 PM) ***bordy is sorry

(08:49:45 PM) ElementC7: esentially yes

(08:50:05 PM) pak33m: bordy: yes switch

(08:50:12 PM) pak33m: back

(08:50:28 PM) bordy has changed the topic to: TOPIC: LoCo Website Management

(08:50:35 PM) pak33m: dant go

(08:51:11 PM) dantalizing: well, basically, since we now have approval, and i think we're all agreed we want a web 
presence...

(08:51:20 PM) Catsceo: indeed

(08:51:21 PM) reya276: yes

(08:51:22 PM) dantalizing: we should decide on who's gonna be managing it

(08:51:31 PM) Catsceo: hmm

(08:51:43 PM) reya276: I can volunteer

(08:51:44 PM) dantalizing: i'll volunteer to help out....

(08:51:45 PM) bordy: Martin_Wilson has drupal experience

(08:51:55 PM) bordy: he ran his schools site on drupal for a few years

(08:51:57 PM) Catsceo: I could with iWeb + .Mac

(08:51:59 PM) dantalizing: i also have  a little

(08:52:11 PM) ***Catsceo ducks from ElementC7's attack

(08:52:12 PM) ElementC7: catsceo: no

(08:52:14 PM) pak33m: Catsceo: nope

(08:52:20 PM) itnet7: can we stick with a true standard cat

(08:52:23 PM) Catsceo: Yes, I was joking

(08:52:31 PM) ElementC7: catceo is blindsided by pak33m

(08:52:33 PM) reya276: well is it possible to create the site and port it over to drupal

(08:52:39 PM) dantalizing: catsceo = troll ;)

(08:52:44 PM) pak33m: sorry its an ubuntu thing really or what they want

(08:53:09 PM) dantalizing: drupal has its own cms....we could import pages, but the whole content management is done 
inside drupal

(08:53:14 PM) itnet7: I have some new e-books on drupal do we have a place we can upload some .pdfs, or .chm files?

(08:53:14 PM) bordy: we have a choice between WP and drupal, but the rest of ubuntu runs their stuff on drupal so I, 
being a Marine, am always a fan of uniformity

(08:53:20 PM) pak33m: since martin is not here, dant would you take it for now?

(08:53:26 PM) reya276: cause, I do this for a living, but I usually code things from scratch

(08:53:34 PM) dantalizing: i will

(08:53:35 PM) pak33m: HOOOAH

(08:53:47 PM) itnet7: your such a stud dant~!

(08:53:50 PM) reya276: cool

(08:53:55 PM) mode (-o pak33m ) by ChanServ

(08:54:25 PM) bordy: lol

(08:54:42 PM) pak33m: bordy: do you remember who it is that dant should get in contact with about the website?

(08:54:42 PM) dantalizing: itnet7 +1

(08:54:53 PM) dantalizing: boredandblogging, i believe

(08:54:58 PM) bordy: rt@ubuntu.com

(08:55:02 PM) bordy: boredandblogging referred me.

(08:55:03 PM) ***pak33m is looking

(08:55:05 PM) dantalizing: ok

(08:55:09 PM) bordy:  I am waiting for the email response

(08:55:16 PM) bordy: check the email I sent the list, it was a CC from the email I sent him

(08:55:25 PM) dantalizing: i'll follow up

(08:55:42 PM) pak33m: dantalizing: you could add it to the projects page too if you wanted

(08:55:47 PM) reya276: dantalizing: Please keep me informed

(08:56:01 PM) dantalizing: will do pak & reya

(08:56:22 PM) itnet7: I can give you a hand with learning a drupal if you need it...Dan ... .just let me know

(08:56:30 PM) itnet7: Not that I know it myself

(08:56:33 PM) pak33m: bordy: looks like it is joe_cot for websites

(08:56:34 PM) ElementC7: quickly adding lan parties to inactive projects, I'll probably do more reaserch during 
winter break.

(08:56:47 PM) reya276: on the marketing side this could be/is our greatest asset

(08:56:49 PM) pak33m: ElementC7: nice

(08:57:10 PM) pak33m: dantalizing: what are yor ideas for the website

(08:57:44 PM) dantalizing: i would think initially, replicating some of the wiki info, but i wanna look at what some 
of th other teams are doing

(08:58:06 PM) ElementC7: hey all, I'm gonna relocat to the couch, I'll be back in a few if I get deconnned

(08:58:19 PM) pak33m: lousiana is a great start! theyre page is awesome but its done on their own

(08:58:19 PM) bordy: A good one is Ubuntu-Ohio, not to flog a dead horse here

(08:58:43 PM) dantalizing: i'll look at those

(08:59:06 PM) bordy has changed the topic to: TOPIC: Projects page and proposed projects

(08:59:15 PM) reya276: which is exactly what I was trying to say

(08:59:25 PM) pak33m: in case nobody has seen it i created a projects page https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FloridaTeam/
Projects

(08:59:39 PM) reya276: it's great that they use a particular cms but we could do better

(09:00:01 PM) ElementC [n=elementc@adsl-152-199-9.mco.bellsouth.net] entered the room.

(09:00:10 PM) pak33m: i think that this will be a great way to track our goings-ons

(09:00:12 PM) ElementC: back

(09:00:26 PM) pak33m: and a great way for us to all get onvolved

(09:00:32 PM) bordy: elementC: if you'd learn to use screen/irssi, you wouldnt have had to log off and back on!

(09:00:59 PM) pak33m: anbody have any ideas for the projects page?

(09:01:03 PM) pak33m: or questions?

(09:01:10 PM) ElementC: no, I lost my wifi when I picked up my laptop and sht the lid

(09:01:13 PM) TonyM2: looking at it now..

(09:01:24 PM) Catsceo: pak33m: I do but its apart of the agenda so I'll talk about it later

(09:01:30 PM) bordy: hmm. wondering about the CSS tutorial, might want to expand that out. We were talking a little 
about this earlier in the week

(09:01:49 PM) bordy: about maybe setting biweekly or monthly sessions where someone comes in and teaches 
something... either from within our team or from outside

(09:02:08 PM) bordy: so maybe expand the scope of that project and make it open in perpetuity.

(09:02:18 PM) reya276: yes, the tutorials project is more than just CSS, this is just a start, but we could move 
into other things

(09:02:42 PM) ElementC: I could probably get Kenneth C Finey to do something on torque Game Engine

(09:02:54 PM) bordy: But maybe just rename it a tutorials project, and use the gCal to schedule upcoming tutorials

(09:03:03 PM) bordy: like statik could learn us all some python!

(09:03:23 PM) reya276: pak33m: recommended that we do as much as possible, specially in the programming/applications 
area

(09:03:48 PM) pak33m: bordy: i asked reya276 to name it Tutorials - <name> to show that it was a tutoial and i think 
that any others that follow should be the same

(09:04:38 PM) pak33m: if we had a server project et al it could be Server - <name>

(09:04:44 PM) bordy: So make a separate tutorial entry in the projects page for each one?

(09:04:44 PM) dantalizing: do we need a tutorial howto?

(09:04:49 PM) bordy: Spose we can see how it goes

(09:04:51 PM) pak33m: yes

(09:05:01 PM) ElementC: sounds good

(09:05:03 PM) reya276: right, because we will have to do these tutorials one at a time, and plan a schedule for 
them, I mean I can pretty much do all the web stuff/design applications, but like everyone else time is limited

(09:05:07 PM) Catsceo: a tutorial about a tutorial?

(09:05:19 PM) dantalizing: recursion is good

(09:05:26 PM) pak33m: Catsceo: we might need that tehe

(09:05:29 PM) ***bordy loves recursive acronyms

(09:06:13 PM) pak33m: how about if any projects that are added get passed to bordy and me first?

(09:06:20 PM) reya276: also I think Lando has some experience as well, so we have the resources, just limited with 
time

(09:06:22 PM) ElementC2 [n=elementc@adsl-152-199-9.mco.bellsouth.net] entered the room.

(09:06:28 PM) ElementC2: potty wifi

(09:06:43 PM) pak33m: bordy: ?

(09:06:48 PM) dantalizing: pak33m & bordy as the project managers, if you will

(09:07:01 PM) bordy: Good enough for me :)

(09:07:05 PM) reya276: I say that would be a good idea, It would be good to have approval just to make sure it fits 
with the schedule

(09:07:23 PM) dantalizing: well, i think project approvals should be part of this meeting

(09:07:23 PM) pak33m: ok

(09:07:29 PM) bordy: But truthfully, we dont need to much in the way of approval, unless yall guys wants us to add 
it to the wiki/calendar for you

(09:07:29 PM) dantalizing: since they are ubuntu-florida projects

(09:07:48 PM) bordy: and reya276 when you set a date for that tutorial, lemme know and we can throw it on the cal

(09:08:39 PM) reya276: yes, will do, just trying to figure out, where to grab some free time to write it all

(09:08:45 PM) pak33m: dantalizing: youre right.  we should pass the projects through the meeting so we can have some 
discussion about it and everybody will know about it

(09:08:55 PM) reya276: but I think I will have to do this by parts

(09:09:04 PM) pak33m: and anything that needs to go on the gcal can pass through bordy

(09:09:12 PM) bordy: no worries reya276, just looking for an excuse to use my calendar :)

(09:09:23 PM) bordy: pak33m: Was going to give all the subteam gurus write access anyway

(09:09:28 PM) reya276: so as I start each section in the outline I will give you dates at least a week prior

(09:09:49 PM) ElementC2: mmm

(09:09:52 PM) pak33m: bordy: ok cool.

(09:09:56 PM) bordy: next item?

(09:10:01 PM) pak33m: yeppers

(09:10:04 PM) reya276:  also I added a discussion group, so if there are any questions before the tutotial feel free 
to post

(09:10:15 PM) pak33m: reya276: nice work

(09:10:15 PM) bordy: Catsceo, youre up

(09:10:20 PM) bordy has changed the topic to: TOPIC: Talk about BBS updates

(09:10:25 PM) reya276: thanks

(09:18:38 PM) Catsceo: I think thats it dan

(09:18:46 PM) pak33m: how was ubuntu repped there?

(09:18:50 PM) Catsceo: there was one other guy in the back of room 2

(09:18:57 PM) ElementC2: nice

(09:18:58 PM) dantalizing: statik gave a nice talk on launchpad, had some questions

(09:19:00 PM) itnet7: I liked it when statik handed out the gutsy pre-release discs and some of the mac guys in the 
crowd actually booted up to ubuntu

(09:19:09 PM) ***Catsceo got one

(09:19:10 PM) ElementC2: hehe\

(09:19:12 PM) dantalizing: yes, during our "install fest"

(09:19:19 PM) Catsceo: and his biz card :D

(09:19:32 PM) Catsceo: how did that go (I left before that)

(09:19:44 PM) itnet7: I was just glad to see some open minded mac guys ;-)

(09:19:53 PM) dantalizing: basically statik handed out Gutsy discs, to whoever asked

(09:20:00 PM) dantalizing: and walked around and answered questions

(09:20:02 PM) ElementC2: wow, thats a rarity

(09:20:02 PM) Catsceo: oh

(09:20:04 PM) pak33m: i have two questions:

(09:20:09 PM) ElementC2: open minded mac guys

(09:20:09 PM) dantalizing: most people just booted up to take a look

(09:20:12 PM) dantalizing: not much installing

(09:20:21 PM) Vorian [n=Steve@ubuntu/member/pdpc.supporter.active.Vorian] entered the room.

(09:20:21 PM) pak33m: 1. was there any discussion about the next one in orlando?

(09:20:40 PM) Catsceo: oh

(09:20:41 PM) bordy: yeah

(09:20:50 PM) itnet7: One guy gave some talks on podcasting, but after he said that the "only" place to get good rss 
podcasting feeds was I-tunes I was unable to take him seriously from that point on

(09:20:51 PM) Catsceo: when is it?

(09:20:56 PM) ElementC2: its like an oxymoron. Open minded mac guys

(09:21:16 PM) pak33m: 2.  can we find presentations from barcamp on the intertubes anywhere?

(09:21:18 PM) Catsceo: ElementC: that insults me!

(09:21:19 PM) dantalizing: no date yet, just what needs to be done different/better next time

(09:21:46 PM) dantalizing: pak33m, presenters had the option to upload their presentations to the barcamporlando wiki

(09:21:50 PM) dantalizing: some did, some did not

(09:21:54 PM) ElementC2: cats: you run debian: you're cool.

(09:21:55 PM) bordy: pak33m: I think gregg is oing to put some collection of whatevre people threw online

(09:22:23 PM) pak33m: bordy: isnt gregg in MN?

(09:22:33 PM) pak33m: ...or something like that

(09:22:41 PM) bordy: Gregg should be in Orlando still

(09:23:04 PM) itnet7: I think that we should try and learn a lot about similar topics and give some demo's next year

(09:23:13 PM) pak33m: anybody elsegot anyhting on barcamp

(09:23:18 PM) ElementC2: I might do something on torque

(09:23:25 PM) dantalizing: definitely worth the 2 hr drive for me

(09:23:29 PM) Catsceo: when is it? (next barcamp)

(09:23:37 PM) itnet7: and how we can use linux to achieve the same thing without spending millions of dollars on 
proprietary S/W

(09:23:40 PM) dantalizing: i enjoyed meeting those that were there, and there were some good talks

(09:24:06 PM) pak33m: hopefully we can all have more events to meetup

(09:24:20 PM) bordy: Moving onward?

(09:24:25 PM) pak33m: yeppers

(09:24:29 PM) ElementC left the room (quit: Connection timed out).

(09:24:37 PM) ElementC2: still here

(09:24:39 PM) Catsceo: yes

(09:24:39 PM) bordy: Catsceo: Youre up again

(09:24:45 PM) ElementC2: sucky connection

(09:24:48 PM) bordy has changed the topic to: TOPIC: SunLake Ubuntu LoCo Team

(09:25:06 PM) ElementC2 is now known as ElementC

(09:25:15 PM) Catsceo: I'm planning to start a club at my school that specifically Ubuntu

(09:25:37 PM) Catsceo: I think a LoCo is a bit of a stretch after I talked to bordy

(09:25:49 PM) dantalizing: would make a great LUG though

(09:25:56 PM) ElementC: yes

(09:26:01 PM) Catsceo: I have so far gotten 4 other people on board

(09:26:11 PM) bordy: After thinkin about it catsceo, why not make it your own personal project, and bring in any 
members to the loCo as a whole

(09:26:11 PM) Catsceo: dan: yes

(09:26:25 PM) bordy: oops brb

(09:26:40 PM) Catsceo: bordy: yes, maybe a a subteam to the loco

(09:26:41 PM) ElementC: I could be a virtual admin

(09:26:45 PM) pak33m: Catsceo: are you gonna get people just around your area and in your school too?

(09:26:51 PM) pak33m: involved that is

(09:26:58 PM) Catsceo: pak33m: no, just the school

(09:27:09 PM) pak33m: ok, sounds great

(09:27:22 PM) bordy: Catsceo: But theres absolutely nothing wrong with say, a SunLake ubuntu Club

(09:27:30 PM) bordy: and it could be a pet project of the team :)

(09:27:32 PM) Catsceo: if its going to be a school sponsored club then we can't bring people from outside the school 
into the club

(09:27:53 PM) dantalizing: still that'd be awesome

(09:27:53 PM) Catsceo: I was thinking SunLake Ubuntu Team (no loco)

(09:27:57 PM) bordy: You could, however, bring said members into this team

(09:28:05 PM) Catsceo: but that abbreviated says SLUT

(09:28:08 PM) Catsceo: :P

(09:28:12 PM) dantalizing: lol

(09:28:16 PM) ElementC: nice

(09:28:18 PM) bordy: Yeah no good.

(09:28:21 PM) ElementC: school apropriate

(09:28:26 PM) ***bordy hates hte Polk Linux Users Group

(09:28:31 PM) itnet7: Cat.... you can utilize your local libraries so that the school doesn't have to be involved

(09:28:31 PM) Catsceo: bordy: thats what I was thinking

(09:28:48 PM) bordy: elementC: youve obviously never been to Polk County, where the average age of GrandMothers is 
25.

(09:28:51 PM) Catsceo: itnet7: they're only windows

(09:29:13 PM) ElementC: woah, so much for ubuntu standards

(09:29:14 PM) itnet7: Oh... you need to use the schools PC's?

(09:29:20 PM) Catsceo: bordy: you have never been to rural pasco

(09:29:35 PM) Catsceo: think god all of the rednecks stayed at the old high school

(09:29:38 PM) itnet7: ROFL Polk Cty.

(09:29:39 PM) Catsceo: thank*

(09:30:08 PM) Catsceo: itnet7: I don't think we have to but we have to have Ubuntu boxes

(09:30:22 PM) pak33m: Catsceo: where will you let us know about it all in as it progresses

(09:30:27 PM) Catsceo: yes

(09:30:28 PM) itnet7: cool

(09:30:37 PM) Catsceo: I still need to contact the school

(09:30:43 PM) Catsceo: but I have a lot of homework

(09:30:51 PM) Catsceo: so its on the backburner atm

(09:30:57 PM) itnet7: do it during class slacker

(09:31:07 PM) itnet7: the hw that i

(09:31:07 PM) Catsceo: they won't let you

(09:31:08 PM) itnet7: s

(09:31:12 PM) itnet7: that sucks

(09:31:12 PM) ElementC: I do classwork during class

(09:31:23 PM) ElementC: I blame the government

(09:31:24 PM) bordy: pshaw

(09:31:29 PM) itnet7: School has changed a lot

(09:31:30 PM) itnet7: LOL

(09:31:35 PM) Catsceo: hypocritical teachers FTW

(09:31:38 PM) ElementC: yeah, we acutally do work

(09:31:41 PM) bordy: Alright moving on

(09:31:42 PM) ElementC: it sucks

(09:31:52 PM) bordy has changed the topic to: TOPIC: A reporting project is underway with some of the ubuntu teams, 
and there has been talk about Ubuntu-US doing an aggregated report for all of the US LoCos. For now we just may want 
to keep it in the back of our minds and start thinking about the proper way/person(s) to report team and sub-team 
status back to Ubuntu-US

(09:32:08 PM) dantalizing: ok, so this is just a heads up

(09:32:32 PM) pak33m: i mentioned taking this on in the team approval meeting and would still be interested

(09:32:40 PM) ElementC: its a mouthful, thats what it is

(09:32:46 PM) dantalizing: the way i'm reporting for server team is gathering updates from subteams, and meeting 
minutes, then pasting results to our reporting page

(09:33:05 PM) dantalizing: i heard ubuntu-us is still working out how they wanna do this

(09:33:21 PM) dantalizing: so just wanted the team to start thinking about it....but sounds like pak is on the ball

(09:33:25 PM) bordy: pak33m is relatively adamant about wanting that slot

(09:33:36 PM) pak33m: i have been working a bit with -us about that

(09:33:43 PM) bordy: shoot, I thought pak33m added the entry anyway!

(09:33:45 PM) ***pak33m me me me

(09:34:04 PM) dantalizing: great, we're done

(09:34:05 PM) ***bordy actually saw pak33m wet himself with excitement over the position

(09:34:06 PM) dantalizing: i think

(09:34:11 PM) itnet7: lol

(09:34:22 PM) itnet7: did he virtually wet himself

(09:34:25 PM) ElementC: bordy: not gonna ask what you two were doing

(09:34:25 PM) bordy: Only new team members around right now are itnet7 and tonyM2 introduce yo'selves!

(09:34:32 PM) itnet7: or was it physical ewwww

(09:34:45 PM) dantalizing: just so you know, itnet7 lies

(09:35:45 PM) bordy has changed the topic to: TOPIC: New Member Introductions

(09:38:30 PM) itnet7: I don't know what else to say really, so I guess so

(09:38:32 PM) bordy: was that a question or a command?

(09:38:33 PM) bordy: lol

(09:38:38 PM) ***ElementC stands still: jimmy cant shoot straight

(09:39:02 PM) pak33m: ElementC: thats all i can do 

(09:39:07 PM) pak33m: TonyM2: ping

(09:39:19 PM) ElementC: pong

(09:39:38 PM) itnet7: I prefer daisy cutters

(09:39:46 PM) ElementC: I still use plasma grenades

(09:39:59 PM) itnet7: daisy cutters are real silly

(09:40:09 PM) pak33m: i guess TonyM2 has faded

(09:40:11 PM) bordy has changed the topic to: TOPIC: Team member wiki pages

(09:44:15 PM) dantalizing: wait, what was the upshot of taht last topic?

(09:44:22 PM) bordy: wow, almost 2 hours. sheesh, we gotta get back in a faster meeting rhythm

(09:45:37 PM) ElementC: that would be nice

(09:45:39 PM) bordy: Dantalizing: the wikis?

(09:45:42 PM) dantalizing: yes

(09:45:48 PM) bordy: people should set theirs up

(09:45:52 PM) dantalizing: oh, ok

(09:45:58 PM) ***pak33m listening to the misses calling

(09:46:15 PM) bordy: Well I will cover this last topic

(09:46:25 PM) bordy: Pak33m and I (aka the meeting team) were talking about the agenda

(09:46:32 PM) pak33m: dantalizing: if you hav not done so, add a personal wiki page

(09:46:44 PM) dantalizing: k

(09:46:44 PM) bordy: its awesome people are finally adding to it. Makes us feel like we arent forcing topics on you 
guys

(09:46:59 PM) ElementC: yes

(09:47:02 PM) pak33m: and Catsceo is in the lead

(09:47:06 PM) ElementC: thats your goal, overlord

(09:47:06 PM) pak33m: :)

(09:47:09 PM) bordy: but it might be better, and make meetings move smoothly, if we had people email agenda items to 
us for organization before being placed

(09:47:19 PM) ElementC: that would be nice

(09:47:25 PM) bordy: cause I went in today and reorganized so they were grouped logically

(09:47:33 PM) pak33m: me too

(09:47:35 PM) Catsceo: I've had that page for months now

(09:47:38 PM) bordy: which is also ok, i guess. but please PLEASE sign your entries

(09:47:56 PM) Catsceo: bordy: I'll try to remember

(09:48:04 PM) bordy: I put a note in there today ;)

(09:48:15 PM) itnet7: don't try do.... Bordy keep the pimp hand strong!!!!

(09:48:21 PM) pak33m: bordy: who do we email?

(09:48:36 PM) bordy: pak33m: Could make it me or you, who wants it?

(09:48:40 PM) ***bordy rolls rock

(09:49:02 PM) pak33m: should we toss a coin?

(09:49:11 PM) bordy: dammit we need a more fun bot!

(09:49:18 PM) dantalizing: this is not intuitive

(09:49:20 PM) ElementC: yes

(09:49:31 PM) bordy: dantalizing: how do you mean

(09:49:32 PM) pak33m: ok, i ll tak it

(09:49:53 PM) bordy: I'll cover all calendar entries if you'll take agenda items

(09:50:01 PM) dantalizing: well i guess if you put a msg to email pak with agenda items, it'll help

(09:50:04 PM) ElementC: sounds good

(09:50:10 PM) bordy: dantalizing yeah

(09:50:12 PM) dantalizing: but what if pak33m is sick, goes out of the country, etc

(09:50:19 PM) dantalizing: we need to update the wiki with a new address

(09:50:38 PM) ElementC: then bordy or discuss at the next meeting

(09:51:00 PM) bordy: well maybe we can work some kinks out, just wondering of a better way to organize meetings 
ahead of time, naw mean?

(09:51:07 PM) dantalizing: yes

(09:51:11 PM) ElementC: mmm

(09:51:23 PM) pak33m: dantalizing: i can put a note in the agenda to email me but somebody else if i am out of the 
country

(09:51:30 PM) dantalizing: lol

(09:51:42 PM) dantalizing: just an example... IMHO, the solution doesnt scale

(09:51:46 PM) dantalizing: but it can be worked out

(09:52:05 PM) dantalizing: not disagreeing with the intent at all

(09:52:08 PM) bordy: dantalizing: TBH I just came up with it, so no thought whatsoever went into that idea

(09:52:20 PM) bordy: so once we can iron it out, I think it should work somehow

(09:52:25 PM) pak33m: dantalizing: i noticed that a few other teams do it that way so i wanted to bring it up

(09:52:35 PM) pak33m: too

(09:52:55 PM) Catsceo: ok peeps I need to get a bath, bbl

(09:53:07 PM) bordy: Yeah I am going to watch me some Shrek with the wife (she's never seen it)

(09:53:15 PM) itnet7: lol

(09:53:17 PM) dantalizing: coincidently, at barcamp there was a talk on how to bathe a catsceo

(09:53:22 PM) bordy has changed the topic to: USF BULLS are ranked 6 in the country in the AP Poll... EAT THAT, 
Gainesville!

(09:53:33 PM) ElementC: wow
