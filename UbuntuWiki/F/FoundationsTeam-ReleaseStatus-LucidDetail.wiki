| Improve the code to deal better with overloaded mirrors and show more meaningful error information to the user. This includes adding an overloaded proxy that can simulate the behavior of overloaded servers by refusing connections in various ways (sending 111, 403, 404, 500&gt; errors at random). We got hit by this with  bug Bug:446956  in update-manager where it does the right thing (error and restore original state), but the error message is pretty bad and the general behavior needs improving. An lts may increase the load on the servers (two upgrades in parallel, plus the image downloading).

| Currently if the Backports repository is enabled, all packages present in the pocket are considered for installation.  Backports is not, by design, particularly suitable for all packages for all users.  It is intended to be for users to install specific packages to gain specific features from a newer release.  The goal should be for packages to only be installed when user requested or when required as a dependency of a requested package.

| Speed up changelogs generation for changelogs.ubuntu.com. This is of particular importance for the users. Currently the changelogs are generated every 8h. This is not ideal so we should either use launchpadlib to query only for the latest changes and make it run much more often (e.g. 1h, 30min) or move this service to launchpad directly (but we need to ensure that its not hitting the DB too hard so pre-generated static files are a plus). The reference bug is #401043

This will be done by regularly reporting our progress towards our 10 second goal for a Dell Mini 10 with SSD storage.  Starting with Alpha1, we will measure and report our progress on a weekly basis, using a combination of bootgraph for the kernel allocation and bootchart for post-kernel to full desktop.  Reports for both SSD and HDD storage will be posted under the Lucid section of   https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FoundationsTeam/BootPerformance .

| Previous releases have provided a "friendly recovery" menu when booting into single-user mode, which provided options for checking filesystems and getting a root shell, intended to allow system recovery.  With the changes to event-based mounting, and system daemon starting, it's often not possible to use this.  This specification covers replacing this with more useful handling of filesystem check failure.

| Discuss a more robust python packaging that is less sensitive to unpack/configure ordering. The current python magic had some issues in the past with upgrades. We should improve this and make the system more robust. Possible design guidelines:  • do building/compiling on the buildds  • catch errors on the buildds (and not on the user machines)  • let dpkg do the shuffling of files  • let dpkg do (file) conflicts checking  • as little complexity in the maintainer scripts as possible  • don't force people learn new tools if something is wrong (dpkg -L python-foo should be enough)  • as little work for the archive-admins as possible  Its also a plus if python application can still be run between "unpack" and "configure".

| The current support timeframe code is too limited for a LTS. For that  we need to get a definitve list (or mechanism) of what is supported  for how long (what is server (5y), what is desktop supported (3y),  what is regular main (18m)). This support must be added to  software-center, synaptic and a textmode tool for the server. Maybe  with a additional --no-longer-support flag to make server people  happy.
