== Introduction ==
Feisty Fawn, the current name of the latest development branch of Kubuntu, will expand on the brand new infrastructure that has landed in Edgy as well as branching out in some exciting new directions. Feature development in the Feisty Fawn release will be improvements to hardware support in the laptop, desktop and high-end server market, and aggressive adoption of emerging desktop technologies.

Herd 2 is the second in a series of milestone CD images that will be released throughout the Feisty development cycle as images known to be reasonably free of CD-build or installer bugs. They represent very current snapshots of Feisty. Kubuntu 7.04, Feisty Fawn, Herd 2 releases can be downloaded from the following URL:
* http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/releases/feisty/

'''NOTE:''' ''This is an alpha (pre-) release. Pre-release version of Feisty are '''__NOT__''' encouraged for anyone needing a stable system or for anyone who is not comfortable running into occasional, even frequent, breakage. Pre-release versions of Feisty '''__ARE__''' recommended for Kubuntu developers and those who want to help in testing, reporting, and fixing bugs.''

== New In Feisty Herd 2 ==
Feisty Fawn Herd 2 CD release brings with it many new and exciting applications. For this latest release of Kubuntu 7.04, usability looks to be the common theme. Besides usability there have been updates to many common applications as well as a changing in the default database application in Kubuntu. With every new pre-release, updates will be documented allowing you to thoroughly test your Kubuntu 7.04 installation. Remember that all of these features are part of a pre-release version of Kubuntu, and may still have issues. We ask that any problems you come across that you file a bug, if one has yet to be filed for your problem.<<BR>>

=== Password Dialog Box ===
Everyone who has been using a computer for a while now has probably noticed the use of asterisks <code>*******</code> when typing in a password. New in Kubuntu 7.04 is the use of solid dots when typing in a password. This new feature is part of the overall future in KDE usability.

'''NOTE:''' The following image displays the box after the user has typed <code>kdesu rm -rf /</code> at the command line. This was done for humouring purposes only and if followed through with, would have removed a majority of the system files the computer needs in order to run. '''Please do not try this at home!'''

=== Multimedia Simplification ===
No more confusion with multimedia applications in Kubuntu. With 7.04 applications such as KsCD (CD player) will not be installed by default since Amarok provides the abilities to play CDs. KAudioCreator has also been removed for ripping CDs since the CD burning application, K3b, offering these same exact functions and more. Kaffeine has removed the audio shortcuts on first load, providing the user with a standalone video playing application.

=== Iconic Directories ===
When using the Konqueror file manager, when you are in the <code>/</code> (root) partition, the <code>/home</code> (home) and <code>/media</code> (media) directories will display custom icons letting you know they are two of your main working directories.

=== Kexi ===
'''''KMenu->Office->Kexi Database Creator''''' <<BR>>
'''Info:''' <nowiki>[[http://www.kexi-project.org/]]</nowiki> <<BR>>

Kexi, an integrated data management application, is an open source competitor for products such as Microsoft Access and Open``Office.org Base. Kexi is now the default database application in Kubuntu 7.04, and is the first step in implementing the specification for <nowiki>[[KubuntuKofficeByDefault| KOffice by default]]</nowiki>. Kexi can be used to create database schemas, insert data, perform queries, process data as well as create custom forms to provide an interface to your data. All database objects (i.e., tables, queries, and forms) are stored in the relational database, allowing the ability to easily share data and design.

Kexi has been shipped by default in the Win``FOSS application. Win``FOSS is the portion of the Desktop CD, that when loaded in Microsoft Windows, will provide you with the options to install Free and Open Source software for Windows.

=== digiKam 0.9 ===
'''''KMenu->Graphics->digiKam Photo Management''''' <<BR>>
'''Info:''' <nowiki>[[http://www.digikam.org/]]</nowiki> <<BR>>

digiKam is an advanced digital photo management application for KDE, which makes importing and organizing digital photos a "snap". The photos can be organized in albums which can be sorted chronologically, by directory layout or by custom collections. This latest release, version 0.9, brings bug fixes, new and improved features, better camera support, and much more. More information on what the latest version contains can be viewed at <nowiki>[[http://www.digikam.org/?q=about/features09x]]</nowiki>

=== Xmodmap ===
Xmodmap will now be loaded on startup. This means that it will be easier for the user to map their function keys which were not mapped by default. Xmodmap can also be used to map the extra buttons on the user's mouse.

=== Tabbed System Settings ===

=== Adept ===
Kubuntu 7.04 will bring for the first time, seamless upgrading to the latest version. In the past users had issue from upgrading from 6.06 (Dapper Drake) to 6.10 (Edgy Eft). This will be no more (note that the use of 3rd party repositories or 3rd party applications may still cause problems which are not of Kubuntu's fault), now it will be easy to update to the latest version, and Adept will even let you know.
'''NOTE:''' At this stage Adept is a work in progress. It has been noted that upon clicking '''''Next''''' will cause the application to crash.
