=== Firmware Test Suite - os2gap test ===

This test checks to see if the OS/2 memory gap at 15MB..16MB is disabled. Most modern firmware has this disabled
by default, but older systems that tried to be OS/2 compatible sometimes enabled this and this is incompatible with Linux. 

==== Examples: ====

<code>fwts os2gap -</code>

..runs the test on your machine and dumps the output to stdout.

=== Explanation of test results ===

Certain test results may require a little more explanation. This section will try and give some context to specific test failures.
