=== About Me ===
I'm a software engineer working at a large educational institution at Galicia (Spain) deploying open source solutions <nowiki>[[http://www.usc.es/osl]]</nowiki> and Ubuntu Member since late 2009.

As a contributor, I am mostly involved in localization: I co-lead the Ubuntu Galician Translators team (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuGalicianTranslators), I coordinate the GNOME Galician translation (http://l10n.gnome.org/users/frandieguez/) and sometimes collaborate with Debian.

I'm also active on <nowiki>[[http://www.glug.es/]]</nowiki> (Galician GNU/Linux User Group) and <nowiki>[[http://www.trasno.net]]</nowiki> (Free Software Localization Asociation).. On this group we try to talk to all the society the vantages of Open Source, making courses, lectures at University among other events related with Open Source. At our website you can find a lot of mini howtos based on Ubuntu OS.

=== IRC ===

I can often be found in 
* #ubuntu+1
* #ubuntu-motu (sometimes)
* #ubuntu-locoteams
* #ubuntu-devel
* #ubuntu-translators
* and very occasionally (ie, not very often) in #ubuntu

=== Contributions to the World of Open Source ===

I translate <nowiki>[[http://l10n.gnome.org/users/frandieguez/|GNOME Desktop]]</nowiki> with just another person that makes all the work of reviewing.

Organization of a lot of Open Source events with the Galician GNU/Linux User Group: 
* Free Knokledge and Rights (<nowiki>[[http://www.glug.es/xornadas-dereito-2008/]]</nowiki>)
* Ubuntu Crash Course at University (<nowiki>[[http://www.usc.es/osl/ubuntu]]</nowiki>)
* Open Source Revolution (<nowiki>[[http://www.usc.es/osl/osrevolution]]</nowiki>)

=== Testimonials ===
* {i}  <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:mbouzada]]</nowiki> - I have been working hardly with frandieguez translating and spreading GNU/Linux here at Galicia (Spain ), and his work and translations are incredible valuated!
* {i}  <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:gallaecio]]</nowiki> - Fran Diéguez has been and still is (and will be) doing a great job translating GNOME into Galician, and he is an important active member of the Galician Localization Comunity.
* {i}  <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:chavescesures]]</nowiki> - I have worked recently with FranDieguez on Ubuntu Translation to Galician. His work coordinating, translating and encouraging people has been really impressive and inspiring. I also know his work on the University of Santiago, and I just can say that he is a tireless Free Software enthusiast. He is doing a really great (and inspiring) job. Thanks, Fran!
* {i} <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:meixome]]</nowiki> - Fran Diéguez and I have shared the organization of seminars for translators, introductory courses on localization technologies and has always passed on his enthusiasm, desire for improvement in everything he does and his ability to work is absolutely amazing so it is a reference as technician as a person in our community that has helped to overcome difficulties of integration in Ubuntu. It is also a developper that encourages the collaboration of others, which facilitates access to knowledge on methods and linguistic tools, correctors, dictionaries, databases ... We will continue in the gap and still do not know what would be best.
* {i} <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:xil]]</nowiki> - I have been the Galician Translators coordinator since 2005, but recently we decided to change the coordination structure and created a Council. I have proposed Fran as a new core member of the new Galician Translators Council because of his great work as a translator, coordinator, bug reporter, etc., etc... 
* {i} <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:dev.fjrial]]</nowiki> - I don't know what else to say, yeah, I know something to say: Thanks Fran, because if it wasn't for you, we wouldn't have a "translated" (more than 80%) version of Ubuntu into galician. And, I don't want to forget to thank other people too, like meixome,mbouzada,xil,... and all the people at the translation team
* {i} <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:leandro-regueiro]]</nowiki> - Fran Diéguez has translated with me the game Battle for Wesnoth to galician. Also he organized translation parties and speeches about free software translation, pushed bugs for getting last Ubuntu release better translated to galician, translated to galician Compiz, GNOME, Netbeans... I could go on, but I think this is enough.
* {i} <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:amaneiro]]</nowiki> - As far as I know Fran Diéguez's work into spreading free software I think he's one of the most valuables free software ambassadors we have here, in Galicia. But more than just spreading the word of free software he also has helped by "showing the code": by organizing seminars or translating, AFAIK. For sure he did more than I wrote here, and for sure he will.
