Ubuntu user for several years.  Looking to get involved in the Ubuntu cause.

== Lubuntu Involvement ==
Member of the Lubuntu Communications team and moderator of the Lubuntu subreddit.

== Projects ==
Moderator of the Lubuntu subreddit, focusing on rejuvenating the community there.

== Experience and Skills ==
Troubleshooting skills honed by professional support training from a leading personal computer manufacturer (think of a fruit) and various PC manufacturers leaving customers like me out to dry ;).

== Plans ==
To be a productive member of the community and help the cause of all Ubuntu projects
