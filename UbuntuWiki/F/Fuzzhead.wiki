Hey there!  This is Fuzzhead. As a child, I had the "unfortunate" nickname of Fuzzhead, after 
my older brother and his posse knocked my hat off exposing way too much of a mess mop. Of course,
being about 9 at the time, meant that I protested and reacted vehemently. The end result was,
that the name stuck!

Now, almost thirty years later, I've turned a childhood nickname into a world wide web identity,
and presence like no other....
