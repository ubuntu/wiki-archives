Ubuntu Florida Team attended the Florida Linus Show in Jacksonville in 2008. We had a strong presence at that show, and were able to meet with some really good contacts there. This year Rod Sharp asked me if I thought that anyone would be interested in "manning" a install fest at both locations in 2009. I told him that I would contact the rest of my team to see if anyone would be interested in giving a hand doing installs, teaching some basics, etc. 

If you would like to help please add your name to the show-of-hands below:
