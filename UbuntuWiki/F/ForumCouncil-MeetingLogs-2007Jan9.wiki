Jan 09 16:26:22 <forumsmatthew> FYI... Matthew=me
Jan 09 16:26:59 <ubuntugeek> : )
Jan 09 16:27:47 <ubuntugeek> Ok lets discuss setting up forum teams. I know pricechild you are ready to roll on this idea.. what thoughts do you have
Jan 09 16:28:07 <PriceChild> Well shall we start with the leadership applications?
Jan 09 16:28:11 <PriceChild> make a small shortlist?
Jan 09 16:28:32 <ubuntugeek> yep
Jan 09 16:28:46 * markvandenborre (n=mark@86-39-107-242.customer.fulladsl.be) has left #ubuntu-meeting ("Ik ga weg")
Jan 09 16:28:47 <ubuntugeek> I think we need to take the leadership applications and make a list for sure.
Jan 09 16:29:06 <jdong> yes
Jan 09 16:29:14 <forumsmatthew> are those who applied here?
Jan 09 16:29:43 <Vorian_> i'll speak for jacobmp92[away] - he's in school right now
Jan 09 16:29:56 <PriceChild> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=289810
Jan 09 16:29:58 <ubuntugeek> we might have to do the electing at the next time.. to give more ample time for people to attend.
Jan 09 16:30:02 <jdong> forumsmatthew: let's first make a list of everyone and do one-by-one
Jan 09 16:30:06 * Larynx (i=Larynx@arthur.mirkksladd.net) has left #ubuntu-meeting
Jan 09 16:30:07 <PriceChild> that thread contains applications only
Jan 09 16:30:09 <ubuntugeek> but we can get a more official list going now
Jan 09 16:30:43 * allee (n=ach@allee.mpe.mpg.de) has left #ubuntu-meeting ("Konversation terminated!")
Jan 09 16:31:02 <jdong> shall we go down the list in order of application?

Jan 09 16:31:48 <jdong> is plb present?
Jan 09 16:32:12 <PriceChild> I don't think many are jd
Jan 09 16:32:28 <jdong> it looks that way :-/
Jan 09 16:32:59 <PriceChild> any comments on plb?
Jan 09 16:33:02 * zenwhen has quit ()
Jan 09 16:33:19 <jdong> ok, different approach: who is here seeking application as a Team Leader?
Jan 09 16:33:36 <forumsmatthew> this is an interesting quote from his application
Jan 09 16:33:37 <jdong> so far, I see Vorian_
Jan 09 16:33:38 <forumsmatthew> "the majority of my posts here are more or less rants in the Cafe and suggestions for development"
Jan 09 16:34:06 <Vorian_> jdong: I'm shooting for secretary... not team leader
Jan 09 16:34:25 <jdong> Vorian_: ah, ok
Jan 09 16:34:32 <jdong> forumsmatthew: yeah, I saw that too
Jan 09 16:35:02 <PriceChild> I'm much more impressed by Lord Illian's application which is up next http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php...47&postcount=3
Jan 09 16:35:21 <PriceChild> it is also for abs beginners against plb (and also hardware)
Jan 09 16:35:31 * LordLinux has quit ("Leaving")
Jan 09 16:35:54 <ubuntugeek> pricechild: I like his application as wel
Jan 09 16:35:56 <ubuntugeek> well*
Jan 09 16:36:11 <forumsmatthew> he's been an active member for some time and a good one as well
Jan 09 16:36:13 <ubuntugeek> Anyone else have comments on him?
Jan 09 16:36:21 <jdong> he looks ideal for beginners
Jan 09 16:36:23 <PriceChild> Lord Illian has also made a sustained positive contribution to the forums
Jan 09 16:36:28 <ubuntugeek> I'll make a list of people then we can make a finalization after we go through the list
Jan 09 16:36:33 <jdong> he seems to have the motivation to help beginners
Jan 09 16:37:14 <ubuntugeek> Ok i'll mark him as a candidate for beginners area
Jan 09 16:37:58 <ubuntugeek> Next, we have http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php...71&postcount=4

Jan 09 16:38:25 * freeflying has quit (Remote closed the connection)
Jan 09 16:38:55 <forumsmatthew> I think he has the potential to be a good team member
Jan 09 16:38:57 <PriceChild> he's reasonably active it seems
Jan 09 16:39:05 <ubuntugeek> Matthew: I agree
Jan 09 16:39:13 <jdong> he's not the most active ever, but does regularly visit the forums
Jan 09 16:39:35 <jdong> I find his signature... questionable though?
Jan 09 16:39:41 <PriceChild> Checking his last posts though... are mostly asking for support
Jan 09 16:39:45 <PriceChild> not much giving
Jan 09 16:39:50 <jdong> my site: www.theironknuckle.com

Jan 09 16:40:36 <forumsmatthew> asks to be a member, he didn't apply for leadership
Jan 09 16:40:43 <jdong> PriceChild: I was gonna say : )
Jan 09 16:40:46 <forumsmatthew> "I would like to be a team member for the beginner section."
Jan 09 16:40:53 <PriceChild> ah ok
Jan 09 16:40:54 <ubuntugeek> dillbert is just wanted to be a team member soo

Jan 09 16:42:13 <forumsmatthew> looking through his posts now...
Jan 09 16:42:22 <ubuntugeek> at least thats how i took his answer to the 1. question
Jan 09 16:42:26 * zenwhen (n=troy@unaffiliated/zenwhen) has joined #ubuntu-meeting
Jan 09 16:42:35 <forumsmatthew> they don't really match his application statements
Jan 09 16:42:38 <jdong> ubuntugeek: it seems like he's ok with being either
Jan 09 16:42:44 <ubuntugeek> or is he saying he wants to be a team leader and wants to be on a team?
Jan 09 16:42:46 <ubuntugeek> ok
Jan 09 16:42:47 <forumsmatthew> he didn't lie, he has just been more active other ways
Jan 09 16:42:57 <jdong> ubuntugeek: all the credentials he gave seem to be leadership-oriented
Jan 09 16:43:06 <forumsmatthew> mainly cafe since early November
Jan 09 16:43:08 * zenwhen has quit (Client Quit)
Jan 09 16:43:31 <ubuntugeek> good candidate for the answered team leader then?

Jan 09 16:45:11 <Bonzodog> Is there any plans to ressurect a team related to the UDSF?
Jan 09 16:45:23 <jdong> Bonzodog: please put that on the agenda if you want it discussed
Jan 09 16:45:30 <jdong> it really isn't related : )
Jan 09 16:45:35 <jdong> even in the most roundabout ways

Jan 09 16:47:40 <PriceChild> not the youngest on the list : )
Jan 09 16:48:06 <ubuntugeek> i think the people applying for a position need to be pretty active in the area

Jan 09 17:06:29 <Vorian_> lord illian can do hardware... right?
Jan 09 17:06:31 <PriceChild> hehe he gave 5 helpeful contributions : )

Jan 09 17:08:32 * PriceChild runs off for a second
Jan 09 17:08:33 <jdong> and measure his contribution level there

Jan 09 17:09:59 <jdong> I think to proceed we'll need to be able to speak with these people
Jan 09 17:10:05 <ubuntugeek> The next step, lets schedule the finalization for the next meeting. This way we can give them time to bring examples along with them.
Jan 09 17:10:12 <jdong> either by IRC, interview in forum thread.... etc

Jan 09 17:17:21 <PriceChild> When people ask me why I spend time hepling out on these forums, I normally tell them that because of the Ubuntu community, I have a completely free and feature rich computer sitting infront of me, but its more than that. Despite the reputation ubuntuforums.org has amongst a large majority of the core Ubuntu community, I'm extremely proud to have been "educated" here, and hope to give this back. Being a mod, and hopefully with this
Jan 09 17:17:21 <PriceChild> position I want to help take ubuntuforums.org to the core group, further integration is only a good thing. Towards this aim, I'm part of the forum ambassadors project, and am opping a couple more channels on irc.

Jan 09 17:21:51 <ubuntugeek> I think the fairest route will be to give vorian a +1. He isn't a staff member (pricey already has fun) and this will allow for some new blood to get on the team.
Jan 09 17:22:19 * Vorian_ does a backflip
Jan 09 17:22:22 <jdong> +1, ubuntugeek; in addition a non-staff secretary has the added benefit of neutrality
Jan 09 17:22:32 <PriceChild> woo go Vorian_ : )
Jan 09 17:22:37 <forumsmatthew> He's also been around for a long time and has a good feel
Jan 09 17:22:40 * Vorian_ does a backflip again!

Jan 09 17:25:53 <jdong> viewing it right now
Jan 09 17:25:56 <heno> I'd like help in collating the test data as it comes in
Jan 09 17:26:20 <heno> It might be just a few testers or a whole flood, who knows
Jan 09 17:26:44 <jdong> first we need to get the word out more prominently
Jan 09 17:26:54 <heno> I also look forward to working with the Forum Ambassadors when they get going
Jan 09 17:26:59 <jdong> I don't think many people will find or look for that particular subforum
Jan 09 17:27:04 <heno> jdong: agreed
Jan 09 17:27:18 <jdong> forumsmatthew, PriceChild, staff, how should we go about it?
Jan 09 17:27:29 <jdong> the forums will have a large base of users willing to conduct such testing
Jan 09 17:27:32 <heno> It needs to be promoted, but a slow, rolling start is OK too
Jan 09 17:27:56 <heno> so we can figure out the mechanics of collating the data
Jan 09 17:28:15 <heno> we need to be able to trust the results also ...
Jan 09 17:28:24 <jdong> I'm currently reading the testing howto
Jan 09 17:29:05 <jdong> does testing require the instalation of ubuntu from the candidate ISO's
Jan 09 17:29:11 <jdong> or just booting them up and making sure they function
Jan 09 17:29:20 <heno> usually, yes
Jan 09 17:29:33 <jdong> ok
Jan 09 17:29:45 <heno> testing the Live CD is just the simplest test
Jan 09 17:29:59 <jdong> heno: first, I think the testing how-to needs to be tweaked a bit to be simpler to understand
Jan 09 17:30:00 <heno> installation (in various ways) is important
Jan 09 17:30:09 <jdong> exactly what is being asked
Jan 09 17:30:30 <heno> the one in the forum, or wiki (or both)?
Jan 09 17:30:39 <jdong> the one in the forum
Jan 09 17:30:54 <jdong> make it more clear what you want users to do in order to be helpful
Jan 09 17:31:10 <jdong> i.e. "find a spare computer that you can do ubuntu installations on, etc"
Jan 09 17:31:12 <heno> btw, also see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/Current
Jan 09 17:31:23 <heno> the current test results page
Jan 09 17:31:39 <heno> right, I see. good point
Jan 09 17:31:59 <jdong> right now, the documents are pretty easy to understand for developers
Jan 09 17:32:03 <forumsmatthew> I think if you make it clear for people who are not used to doing this sort of thing
Jan 09 17:32:05 <forumsmatthew> how to do it
Jan 09 17:32:12 <forumsmatthew> you will get some good volunteers
Jan 09 17:32:16 <jdong> right
Jan 09 17:32:19 * Vor has quit (Read error: 104 (Connection reset by peer))
Jan 09 17:32:19 <heno> ok, cool
Jan 09 17:32:23 <forumsmatthew> most forums members are new at this sort of thing
Jan 09 17:32:29 <forumsmatthew> but want to help
Jan 09 17:32:33 <forumsmatthew> they just don't know how
Jan 09 17:32:45 <forumsmatthew> give clear steps and I think they will come

Jan 09 17:33:44 <heno> is there any other place we should post a basic introduction
Jan 09 17:33:47 <jdong> an introduction paragraph explaining in easy to understand terms of what ISO testing is, why it needs to be done, and what it involves from the user
Jan 09 17:33:53 <heno> the Cafe or something?
Jan 09 17:33:56 <jdong> would be nice for the howto
Jan 09 17:34:08 <heno> right
Jan 09 17:34:09 <forumsmatthew> I agree: howto
Jan 09 17:34:16 <jdong> heno: revise the testing how-to to be an easy-to-understand document
Jan 09 17:34:27 <jdong> with a quick summary at the top so users can quickly determine if they want to do it or not
Jan 09 17:34:45 <heno> yep, ok

Jan 09 17:34:57 <heno> thanks, good feedback
Jan 09 17:35:04 <jdong> then, every time a candidate CD rolls out, you can post a "ISO Testers Required" post in, say, the cafe, linking to that howto
Jan 09 17:35:39 <jdong> or perhaps such postings would be more appropriate in the Feisty Fawn development forum
Jan 09 17:36:07 <heno> Yes, I'm already a bit active there
Jan 09 17:36:10 <forumsmatthew> I think the development forum is the place where you are most likely to find people interested
Jan 09 17:36:18 <jdong> (http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=179)
Jan 09 17:36:36 <forumsmatthew> but an announement in the cafe with a link to the howto couldn't hurt
Jan 09 17:36:36 <heno> It also helps if they have some Linux familiarity too
Jan 09 17:36:40 <PriceChild> We really need to make the dev forum useful....
Jan 09 17:36:41 <jdong> right
Jan 09 17:36:53 <heno> so they can file good bug reports with logs, etc
Jan 09 17:37:00 <PriceChild> edgy's was great but feisty's been a bit pants... a project like this would help loads
Jan 09 17:37:03 <jdong> heno: you can request any level of experience you think appropriate, just make it clear what you expect from testers please
Jan 09 17:37:18 <jdong> I also noticed this from heno: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=333915
Jan 09 17:37:43 <jdong> some of that should probably be expanded or updated
Jan 09 17:37:57 <jdong> i.e. AFAIK new specs aren't gonna be accepted for feisty anymore
Jan 09 17:38:17 <jdong> bug reporting, triaging, and testing ISO images should be expanded a bit
Jan 09 17:38:19 <heno> or reworded, rather
Jan 09 17:38:24 <jdong> with more info on what would be helpful
Jan 09 17:38:30 <jdong> and in the case of triaging, how to go about it
Jan 09 17:38:39 <heno> (I posted it just yesterday)
Jan 09 17:39:11 <heno> the point is basically that there is little point suggesting new features now
Jan 09 17:39:28 <heno> but you can always start on a spec for Feisty+1
Jan 09 17:39:31 <jdong> right
Jan 09 17:39:36 <heno> I should make that more clear
Jan 09 17:39:37 <jdong> say that bluntly

Jan 09 17:40:08 <heno> IN THE FORUM THINGS NEED TO BE SAID BLUNTLY I get it
Jan 09 17:40:17 <jdong> more to the likening of "if you don't help us find these bugs, don't cry about the bugs on release day"

Jan 09 17:41:07 <PriceChild> big bold red writing helps I find :P
Jan 09 17:41:13 <jdong> heno: at one point my backports guidelines were bumped to size-108 fonts
Jan 09 17:41:20 <jdong> because nobody would freakin listen
Jan 09 17:41:29 <heno> heh, ok
Jan 09 17:42:05 * ubuntugeek has quit ()
Jan 09 17:42:32 <heno> right, I think that's all from me for now
Jan 09 17:42:36 <jdong> heno: and whenever you see the forums having unholy behavior (using the forums as a bug tracker, posting unsafe checkinstalled debs or other unsafe instructions, etc) please let us know
Jan 09 17:42:46 <jdong> we'd like to keep that sort of behavior controlled
Jan 09 17:42:52 <heno> I'll check in on these meetings regularly
Jan 09 17:42:55 * Vorian_ has quit (Read error: 104 (Connection reset by peer))
Jan 09 17:43:01 <jdong> don't be afraid to use the Report Posts button when you see stuff like that, heno
Jan 09 17:43:15 <heno> right, ok
Jan 09 17:43:32 <heno> I might apply for mod rights in the feisty forum too
Jan 09 17:43:48 <heno> (as I have in the ISO testing forum)
Jan 09 17:43:51 <jdong> heno: right now we have technical issues with vbulletin and making limited-mods
Jan 09 17:43:59 <jdong> heno: you say you have mod access in iso testing?
Jan 09 17:44:03 * vorian_ (n=steve@cpe-76-181-131-162.columbus.res.rr.com) has joined #ubuntu-meeting
Jan 09 17:44:04 <heno> yes
Jan 09 17:44:10 <jdong> ok, perhaps things have changed
Jan 09 17:44:18 <heno> and I've used it sucessfully
Jan 09 17:44:25 <jdong> I +1 your mod rights to feisty forum
Jan 09 17:44:35 <jdong> ubuntugeek will have to apply that when I talk to him later
Jan 09 17:44:42 * Nafallo (n=nafallo@ubuntu/member/nafallo) has left #ubuntu-meeting ("Ex-Chat")
Jan 09 17:44:49 <jdong> ok, that takes care of the official agenda
Jan 09 17:44:50 <heno> right
Jan 09 17:44:54 <jdong> right?
Jan 09 17:45:11 <PriceChild> jdong, could we also maybe have the forum council subforum on the frontpage?
Jan 09 17:45:14 <vorian_> according to the wiki yes
Jan 09 17:45:23 <jdong> PriceChild: that's stuff you talk to Ryan about
Jan 09 17:45:26 <PriceChild> hehe ok
Jan 09 17:45:31 <jdong> I don't like touching that part of admincp
Jan 09 17:45:33 <PriceChild> will ask him later
Jan 09 17:45:34 <jdong> there is one more thing I'd like to take this time to discuss....
Jan 09 17:45:36 <PriceChild> jdong, what do you touch?
Jan 09 17:45:51 * licio has quit ("shutdown -h now")
Jan 09 17:46:07 <jdong> PriceChild: I spent a good portion of yesterday reading vbulletin documentation
Jan 09 17:46:13 <jdong> so I'm getting better darnit
Jan 09 17:46:20 <vorian_> lol
Jan 09 17:46:21 <PriceChild> he he i was only joking sorry
Jan 09 17:46:41 <jdong> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=330230
Jan 09 17:46:49 <jdong> we still have this unaddressed res center thread
Jan 09 17:47:04 <jdong> regarding where to draw the line with spamming
Jan 09 17:47:42 <vorian_> it is borderline....
Jan 09 17:48:04 <jdong> vorian_ indeed it is, but in this case the user seems to have good intentions at heart
Jan 09 17:48:12 <jdong> and from that thread, he is cooperative
Jan 09 17:48:17 <vorian_> agreed, I see no self promotion
Jan 09 17:48:28 <vorian_> it is for the betterment of ubuntu
Jan 09 17:49:01 <jdong> currently we have very weak/vague guidelines as to advertising vs spam
Jan 09 17:49:13 <jdong> "If a thread is spam it will be moved to the forum jail."
Jan 09 17:49:27 <vorian_> what about community market
Jan 09 17:49:29 <vorian_> ?
Jan 09 17:49:38 <PriceChild> I think its best we leave it to staff's discression
Jan 09 17:49:39 <jdong> vorian_ that says "please do not spam"
Jan 09 17:49:57 <jdong> aye, I think it should be left at the staff's discretion
Jan 09 17:50:09 * vorian_ sorry
Jan 09 17:50:23 <jdong> I was thinking obtaining staff approval too
Jan 09 17:50:43 <jdong> particularly low-bean-count people
Jan 09 17:51:11 <heno> Perhaps let him re-post a slightly altered version, say without the '$$$'
Jan 09 17:51:38 <heno> at some clause about good taste to border-line spam case decisions
Jan 09 17:51:50 <heno> add, rather
Jan 09 17:51:50 * crimsun (n=crimsun@pdpc/supporter/silver/crimsun) has left #ubuntu-meeting
Jan 09 17:51:59 <jdong> right
Jan 09 17:52:11 <jdong> I'm all for allowing tousimis to continue with his service
Jan 09 17:53:55 <PriceChild> I'm happy with him also
Jan 09 17:54:46 <jdong> so far I'm gonna reply to him that (1) He may continue promoting/developing/offering his service (2) Spam vs not spam decisions will be made on a per-case basis at the discretion of the staff member handling the thread (3) If you have low-bean count it's helpful to first clear it by PM'ing an administrator or staff member
Jan 09 17:54:50 <jdong> any objections?
Jan 09 17:55:05 <PriceChild> in addition to no. 1
Jan 09 17:55:17 <PriceChild> the promoting in the appropriate subforum
Jan 09 17:55:24 <PriceChild> and signature
Jan 09 17:55:31 <jdong> (marketplace?)
Jan 09 17:55:34 <PriceChild> yup
Jan 09 17:56:54 <jdong> what currently happens when a user is banned?
Jan 09 17:56:58 <jdong> are they unable to log in?
Jan 09 17:57:19 <PriceChild> depends on the type of ban?
Jan 09 17:57:24 * licio (n=licio@ubuntu/member/licio) has joined #ubuntu-meeting
Jan 09 17:57:43 <jdong> spam infractions?
Jan 09 17:57:55 <PriceChild> that's just a ban on the name
Jan 09 17:57:58 <jdong> the OP seems to state that he couldn't read his PM's?
Jan 09 17:58:04 <PriceChild> yeah
Jan 09 17:58:04 <jdong> once he was banned
Jan 09 17:58:09 <jdong> heh
Jan 09 17:58:16 * Czessi (n=Czessi@dslb-088-073-045-159.pools.arcor-ip.net) has joined #ubuntu-meeting
Jan 09 17:58:17 <PriceChild> when you log in because of spam infraction you can't see aything
Jan 09 17:58:30 <jdong> can you see your infraction notices
Jan 09 17:58:35 <PriceChild> jdong, http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=332163
Jan 09 17:58:37 <PriceChild> Nope
Jan 09 17:58:39 <jdong> and can you contact staff members for a rebuttal?
Jan 09 17:58:43 <PriceChild> vorian_, sorry but you can't see that link
Jan 09 17:58:44 <PriceChild> No
Jan 09 17:58:47 <jdong> uhm, lovely
Jan 09 17:58:55 <PriceChild> jdong, my issues with it were outlined int hat thread
Jan 09 17:58:59 <vorian_> PriceChild:
Jan 09 17:59:35 <jdong> ok
Jan 09 17:59:56 <jdong> I think we need to refine the behavior of infraction-based bans
Jan 09 18:00:02 <PriceChild> uip
Jan 09 18:00:05 <jdong> but at a later meeting when all staff members are present
Jan 09 18:00:10 <jdong> it simply doesn't make sense at the moment
Jan 09 18:00:13 <PriceChild> jdong, arg rav tux has changed his avatar again lol :P
Jan 09 18:00:34 <vorian_> hehe
Jan 09 18:01:03 <PriceChild> ubuntugeek mentioned making another meeting within a week or two because of the approval of matthew and mikeb
Jan 09 18:01:09 <PriceChild> we can sort things out then
Jan 09 18:02:23 * mr_pouit (n=mr_pouit@LAubervilliers-151-12-73-187.w193-252.abo.wanadoo.fr) has joined #ubuntu-meeting
Jan 09 18:02:41 <PriceChild> So....
Jan 09 18:02:55 * jdong still typing out a flowery version of what he said
Jan 09 18:03:24 <vorian_> jdong: Does this council have a launchpad entry?
