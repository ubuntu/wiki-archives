== Full Screen Applications ==

Let's create a list of applications that exhibit full screen behavior so we can reason about user scenarios and come up with good solutions to various problems and conflicts caused by full screen behavior (e.g. notify-osd behavior).

* Games
* Firefox + firefox flash videos
* OpenOffice Impress
* Totem, VLC, and other movie players
* MonoDevelop and other IDEs
* OpenOffice Writer (has a nice fullscreen mode!)
* GIMP
* Image viewer , picasa slideshows
* Remote Desktop Clients
* Skype Video Chat, and other video chat applications
