== About Me ==
I started using Ubuntu sometime in the middle of 2008 and Ubuntu 8.04 (Hardy Heron) was my first version of Ubuntu that I ever installed. Ubuntu really grew on me, and I've stuck with it ever since. I believe Ubuntu has great potential on desktop computers, not only because of the Linux philosophy but also because of the great community that comes with it. I've decided to contribute to the growth, and I'm currently working with <nowiki>[[Lubuntu]]</nowiki>, where I'm part of the artwork team.

=== Contributions ===

==== Lubuntu Scrollbars ====
Extension that makes Chrome/Chromium's scrollbars match with Lubuntu.

==== Lubuntu ====
Lubuntu 12.04 is the first version of Lubuntu where my contributions can be seen in the finished product. I've been working close with <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/rafaellaguna|Rafael Laguna]]</nowiki>, the other half of the artwork team and the artwork team leader. We've brainstormed, had long discussions and taken decisions together on how we can improve Lubuntu esthetically. 

Our artwork can be seen and followed at <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lubuntu/Artwork/Incoming/|this site]]</nowiki> by navigating through the different releases.

My work with Lubuntu has become broader than just creating artwork, and I've become more involved with the surroundings of the desktop, improving settings and the general desktop experience.
