=== Summary ===
Frets on fire is a game similar to Guitar Hero but you play it with the keyboard (or the usb controller from Xbox 360). This game would make a nice addition to the list of games shipped with ubuntu.

=== Outstanding Issues ===
There are licence issues with the music content of the game which need to be considered.

=== BoF agenda and discussion ===
