__TOC__


This is a brief summary of bugs fixed between Ubuntu 20.04.2 and 20.04.3.  '''This summary covers only changes to packages in ''__main__'' and ''__restricted__'', which account for all packages in the officially-supported CD images; there are further changes to various packages in ''universe'' and ''multiverse''.'''  Some of these fixes were by Ubuntu developers directly, while others were by upstream developers and backported to Ubuntu.  For full details, see the individual package changelogs.

In addition to the bugs listed below, this update includes all security updates from the <nowiki>[[https://ubuntu.com/security/notices?order=newest&release=focal&details=|Ubuntu Security Notice list]]</nowiki> affecting Ubuntu 20.04 LTS that were released up to and including August 17, 2021.  The last update included was USN-5043-1 (Exiv2 vulnerabilities).

=== Installation bug fixes ===

Updated CD images are provided with this release, including fixes for some installation bugs.  (Many installation problems are hardware-specific; for those, see "Hardware support bugs" below.)

| update-notifier
| Bug:1913726
| Handle bad apt indexes. apt.Cache() can fail if the apt lists can't be parsed for whatever reason. Handle that and exit 0 so that update-notifier continues.  A consequence of being in this state is that we can't find any oem metapackages if any are applicable. If the indexes become good again then we'll find them next time.

|-
| sssd
| Bug:1905790
| debian/nss-database-pem-exporter: Add to sssd-common and run on postinst. When upgrading from previous versions (that were compiled using the NSS crypto backend) we need to migrate the trusted CA certificates that the user may have added to the SSSD's NSS system database (that defaults to /etc/pki/nssdb). To do this, and not to introduce a new dependency on libnss3-tools (which is not shipped by default, other than making the parsing not working in some scenarios) I've added a small C tool that we compile and install as part of the sssd-common package which is able to get all the trusted CA certificates for a NSS database and export them in PEM format. The nss-database-pem-exporter is then used in the postinst script where we now: 1. Read the SSSD settings 2. Convert all the certificates in the configured NSS databases 3. Store them all, appending them to the (new) default location (/etc/sssd/pki/sssd_auth_ca_db.pem) 4. Disables the configured locations if pointing to NSS dbs (needed or we'll leave the configuration with broken values). At this point nss-database-pem-exporter is then the only binary in the package that still depends on NSS libraries.
