__TOC__

March was an extremely busy month for the Florida team. We held only one meeting and the logs can be found <nowiki>[[FloridaTeam-Minutes-20100309| here]]</nowiki>.
We worked through the re-approval process and gained re-approval status. Other highlights of March:
* A lot of development and testing has been done on the LoCo Directory, and the Directory is starting to become even more heavily utilised. 
* Another Space Coast Meetup was held on March 25th (approximately 10 in attendance).
* Membership increased, and some new faces have been participating in IRC.
