An update from the Forums Council for May of 2013

* Overdrank has been put on emeritus status per request.  He has served as both a moderator and administrator        during his time, he will be missed.

* A new subforum for Forum approved Ubuntu Members has been created. We hope this will lead to greater transparency and involvement in issues aas they arise.
 
* The Ubuntuforum Code of Conduct is being looked at - to make the CoC more specific in some cases, the Posting tips will be removed and posted elsewhere on the forum. The registration code will be a simplified version of the full CoC.

* We had a visit from pleia2 asking if we wanted to look at getting forum information into the newsletter, we have asked the userbase for ideas.
 
* We approved one new Ubuntu Member this month, Irihapeti - http://ubuntuforums.org/member.php?u=346442https://launchpad.net/~irihapeti
