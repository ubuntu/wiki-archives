<bordy> ***REVIEW LAST MONTH***

<bordy> All I saw on there that might need following up is our wikis... do all three of us paying attention have them? ;)

<ElementC> Nope

<ElementC> Will do.

<bordy> theyre so fun! ;)

<Mike_F> our group wiki looks cool

<Mike_F> someone is working hard on it no doubt

<bordy> Only reason I stress them is they are a good way for each of us to track our stuff, list what we've done, etc, and put out contact info.

<ElementC> yeah

<ElementC> I love tomboy

<bordy> Ours will be a lot nicer when Xzai gets the drinking out of his system

<bordy> he started doing it, then turned 21

<ElementC> wait... is that legal?

<bordy> d'what?

<ElementC> never mind

<bordy> lol. But because he never finished I took the sidebar out of our front page, for looks. It wil go back soon.

<bordy> Alright, on to this month.

<ElementC> they're dropping like flies.

<bordy> lol. Vorian'll be back, he knows I wanted him to talk at this one.

<bordy> he and his team have their shite together

<bordy> its awesome.

<Mike_F> How many people are in our group

<bordy> Total? 40 as of today

<ElementC> wow

<bordy> yeah.

<ElementC> so... on to business?

<bordy> hmm, lets try pinging some people real quick.

<bordy> ax3 ax4 chadmiller ep2011 macluvjay

<ElementC> I'll ping my knowledeable friends

<bordy> mark007 poningru ropetin statik zbrown!

<bordy> ping pingerton!

<chadmiller> j0!?

<ElementC> Ug.

<ElementC> No one that I wanted to atttend is on

<ElementC> oh well

<Mike_F> okay; what's the deal

<bordy> Anyway, we have that event coming up June 1st

<bordy> Any more news on that Mike?

<Mike_F> yes

<bordy> sweet

<Mike_F> i signed up for the event, but need to pay them

<bordy> orly? Its free?

<ElementC> how much?

<Mike_F> the afternoon event is free to the public

<bordy> oh thats nice.

<Mike_F> i need to pay for the table, but this is also a benfit

<Mike_F> to my business

<bordy> And its on Friday June 1?

<Mike_F> yes

<bordy> dang, I most likely won't be there :(

<Mike_F> Holiday inn ucf

<ElementC> meh

<ElementC> school

<Mike_F> do we have orlando people in our group

<bordy> Well we do have a couple people signed up so far

<Mike_F> that's cool

<bordy> yeah, CoachDanny is in O-town, and alot are nearby

<Mike_F> the morning event is a "speed networking" and costs $25

<Mike_F> i plan to blow that off

<ElementC> good idea

<bordy> I've always wanted to see what goes on at those, but meh. 25 is 25.

<Mike_F> but I will be hanging around the bar or something

<ElementC> good meeting place

<Mike_F> it's standArd chamber of commerce

<bordy> Alright, next agenda item

<bordy> **Wiki Sub-pages**

<bordy> I Don't know if you guys have had the time to search around the page, but we've added some sub-pages to it

<ElementC> not a whole lot... but enough

<bordy> One I am particularly proud of is our new users page

<bordy> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FloridaTeam/NewUser

<bordy> respectfully stolen from Vorian and Ohio

<ElementC> figures

<Mike_F> i am looking

<ElementC> none of us are that good

<bordy> oh dang mike_f, gj on the marketing ideas page

<Mike_F> thanks

<bordy> Mike_f as you get more info on the EOCC expo, could you add it to the events page?

<ElementC> eh.

<Mike_F> yes

<ElementC> my wifi is dieing randomly

<bordy> Right now we only have the three signed up (I may still be able to go)

<bordy> but with more info, maybe more would commit

<ElementC> I know I would

<Mike_F> let me check eocc.org

<bordy> Eventually, i would like to get some people dedicated to individual aspects of the
loco, such as marketing, new user support, wiki maintenance, etc.

<bordy> But I am guessing that would be contingent on people showing up to the meetings :(

<Mike_F> maybe we need to explore different times

<Mike_F> people may be out on sunday afternoon

<bordy> its possible, I put it out before the first meeting and nobody gave me an answer.

<bordy> so I set a time, to make it easier.

<ElementC> .

<bordy> I even put out a poll on launchpad

<ElementC> true

<ElementC> Sundays are the only good time for most

<Mike_F> maybe people should know that the chat channel is always open

<bordy> I wonder if we pushed it later, say 8 on sundays

<bordy> mike_f thats covered on the new user page, in case anyone ever needs help or needs
to know something

<ep2011> bordy, I know for me, around now I do my homework (which is why I can't be active
in the chat) so 8 would be much better.

<Mike_F> okay do you expect people to read "manuals"

<bordy> thats good to know. how do you feel about 8 sundays, Mike_f and elementC?

<ElementC> uh... It could be interesting

<bordy> not so much manuals, but the economist in me would expect people to act in their own
best interest

<bordy> and that new user page (the subpage of our wiki) is very short and explains it

<ep2011> Going back to homework. If you need me say my name and Ill try to come back when I
can

<Mike_F> okay

<bordy> alright ep2011 gl on that.

<Mike_F> weekly meetings may be easier for people too

<ep2011> :) Thanks

<bordy> I also put that idea out, with no response

<ep2011> Mike_F, Definatly on that too

<ep2011> Then if they cant go to a meeting, its not as bad, as theres another in a week

<bordy> I said in the spirit of Ohio team (wheres Vorian!?) I would be here every sunday
afternoon in case we need to go over things again

<Mike_F> right

<ElementC> I could go to weeklies. easier to remember

<ElementC> I usually show up on sundays anyway

<bordy> We still need a monthly, I believe, where most should be expected to show up

<bordy> or the cohesion is lost

<ElementC> right

<bordy> Alright, we'll throw that idea out to the team too. THats good, I like the idea of
weeklies

<ElementC> so... exactly as is with the exception of a time change on the monthly?

<ElementC> essentially

<bordy> Probably. the weeklies will prolly fall a little later in the day as well

<Mike_F> are we saying the monthy meeting would be a different time

<bordy> yeah. Probably 8 pm on the first sunday of the month

<Mike_F> which isn't a bad idea

<bordy> In fact, if more people show up tonight I may end up repeating the meeting later ;)

<ElementC> alright. next agenda item?

<bordy> Next item is an important one

<bordy> ** Individual Contributions **

<bordy> Which falls in with individual wikis

<ElementC> I get the hint

<ElementC> I have a note.

<bordy> it doesnt really matter if you are planning on applying for ubuntu membership, its
always a good idea to track what you've done for ubuntu community

<bordy> like bug triaging, answering questions in launchpad or forum, helping in #ubuntu,
etc

<bordy> what I need, is for everyone to let me know what they have done, with links if
possible, because after this next EOCC event poningru and I are going to go in front of the
CC to apply for approval

<Mike_F> Presently I have a interest in marketing

<Mike_F> since that is what is going to get me customers for my business

<ElementC> uh... I am in communication with michele philips (possible spelling error) in
regards to changing the default OS installed on used computers donated from NASA to various
school boards.

<bordy> oh thats right, you were talking about that the other day.

<ElementC> I have no "links" yet, as this has been face to face communication

<ElementC> yeah

<Mike_F> the school angle is excellent

<bordy> well if you get it rolling at all, (even a little) email me about it.

<bordy> no links necessary, in that case

<bordy> but specifics could help

<ElementC> will do

<bordy> When I picked up the parts from that lady the other day, she said she was getting
out of the business so is going to give me ALOT of stuff.

<bordy> she works with "Computers for Kids" which seems a more directed version of freegeek

<bordy> without the labor requirement for the computers

<bordy> (meaning no need for a storefront)

<bordy> I wish coachdanny were here

<ElementC> don't we all?

<bordy> but stuff like that, even trying to get it going, could help it

<Mike_F> i think computers for kids is in my building

<bordy> well he is the one actively trying to chase down a freegeek organization in florida

<ElementC> phisically or metaphorically, Mike?

<Mike_F> i am not sure, but they are heavy on the MS

<bordy> and I was thinking of looking into others, because freegeek has weird requirements
for people to get their comps

<bordy> this lady was doing linux, but not every time. She said the reason she did MS alot
is cause they were donated, and people were comfortable with them.

<bordy> but I figure if we are already comfortable with linux, why not install that and take
the time to teach someone to use it

<ElementC> makes sense

<bordy> I think that could really help us in the community, get the word out in Florida. WE
dont even need to work with computers for kids, we could work through them, get their
contacts, and donate some of our own stuff

<Mike_F> we should make sub-teams for these activities

<Mike_F> marketing

<bordy> only part I am worried about is having to set up a 501(c)(3)

<Mike_F> free computers to kids

<Mike_F> etc

<bordy> mike_f I would love to, thats why we made the sub pages... but nobody has told me
(outside of you and xzai) what they'd like to do ;)

<ElementC> I can do marketing... I've been handing out CDs already

<Mike_F> at least that's a start

<ElementC> posters in public places aren't uncommon either

<bordy> did you guys see my email last night about posters?

<Mike_F> i ordered some posters from the swag dude

<ElementC> I thought I signed up for the list, but it never came through

<ElementC> lemme set that up

<Mike_F> i think you forwarded his message to our list

<bordy> yeah thats the one

<ep2011> bordy,

<Mike_F> i like the thing with the road is reminds me of my On A1A logo

<ep2011> Id buy posters if they were from cafepress or similar

<ElementC> yeah

<ep2011> but I wouldnt be aloud to from him

<ep2011> :\

<ElementC> that's the one I've been using

<bordy> you wouldnt be allowed ep2011?

<Mike_F> i will make up copies when i get them

<ep2011> bordy remember, im a teen, my parents wouldn't let me

<bordy> oh thats right.

<bordy> afternoon, epidemic

<Epidemic> hey

<Epidemic> guess i'm a little late, but.... I did what I could

<bordy> meh, no worries. I'll put the transcripts up

<bordy> I think we've covered just about everything save what nate put up, and he isnt here
so I Am not sure what to say about it.

<bordy> Anyone else got anything?

<Epidemic> an ubuntu florida party?

<ElementC> heck yes

<bordy> oh thats right!

<max_harmony> nice idea

<bordy> we were talking about that

<max_harmony> where at?

<bordy> when would be good?

<bordy> max_harmony it would most likely be in or near orlando

<ElementC> ug... too far away

<bordy> since that seems pretty central to all of us

* ** Epidemics is now known as Epidemic

<bordy> most are near orlando, with a couple in miami and a couple in tally.

<Epidemic> sorry, was on a horrible client

<max_harmony> tally here

<ElementC> Brevard area is growing.

<Epidemic> i'm near west palm

<bordy> elementc yeah its got a population of like 9 now, right?

<bordy> ;)

<max_harmony> and from everyone here: THAT'S WAY TO FAR

<ElementC> You're hilarious

<ElementC> I know

<ElementC> Maybe some day

<bordy> well, I am guessing people in tally or Miami are gonna get kinda screwed any time,
really. Then again, they both have their share of people so could always have localized
parties

<Mike_F> i think merrit island is bigger then lakeland

<bordy> pssht

<Epidemic> i'm having some legal problems right now, but in a few months hopefully it should
all be over, and I might be able to throw something... i'm right off of (% and only 5 miles
from the turnpike... so pretty easy to find

<Epidemic> 95*

<ElementC> eh

<ElementC> I prefer public places

<ElementC> like parks

<bordy> I am willing to drive most anywhere, but tally and miami are a bit far for me.

<max_harmony> Where is everyone here, anyway?

<bordy> no, paneras with the free wifi!

<Mike_F> cocoa beach

<bordy> cept I cant run ubuntu on my lappy.

<bordy> ugh

<Epidemic> why not?

<bordy> its craptacular

<bordy> ibm thinkpad 600

<bordy> with 6g of HD

<bordy> and 128 ram

<ElementC> NASA sells 100 used laptops

<ElementC> *$100

<bordy> orly?

<bordy> decent ones?

<ElementC> they all run it, too

<Epidemic> I know mine I had a problem with acpi, and it kept locking up, and I had to
disable acpi to get it to work right :(

<bordy> I run puppy linux right now

<ElementC> DSL all the way

<ep2011> bordy - im near west palm and miama

<Epidemic> ... cable all the way

<ep2011> miami

<max_harmony> EC, not here

<max_harmony> Dialup is here

<Epidemic> i'm getting 9.5 Mb on my cable right now

<ElementC> no, Damn Small Linux

<ElementC> not Digital Subscriber Line

<bordy> I have CDs for DSL, Xubuntu, Fluxbuntu, and puppy... but puppy runs the best w/o
flickering

<Epidemic> oops :P

<bordy> Alright, so aside from the party, which will take some serious logistical planning,
anyone have anything else?

<bordy> we'll need to get a larger consensus on the party

<ElementC> I had something.

<ElementC> but I lost it.

<ep2011> bordy, I don't think a party with like 5 people would be worth it

<max_harmony> Solaris 10, Ubuntu and Kubuntu 6.06, and soon all Shippedit Ubuntus 7.10

<ep2011> unless we got like 10+

<Epidemic> not really

<bordy> ep2011 I know, thats why we need to get more people involved before we can commit

<ep2011> Yeah

<Epidemic> it'd be great to get like, 50+ IF POSSIBLE

<ep2011> at PANERA BREAD

<ep2011> :D

<bordy> ep2011 we have 40 members total, with like 25 who are very active in here at least

<Mike_F> what about somewhere near the orlando airport

<Epidemic> I don't think panera bread would be happy

<ep2011> bordy, ohh, nevermind then

<ElementC> uh... Oh, yeah. about the custom distros

<ep2011> Epidemic, Why? You buy food, thats what they like. Wed all buy at least a coffee

<ElementC> I'd buy some soup

<ElementC> any word on them?

<Epidemic> but we'd also fill them up to and steal all their bandwidth :P

<bordy> elementC I think max_harmony and Mike_f were looking into them

* ep2011 goes back to homework

<max_harmony> We'd scare everyone else away!

<bordy> I am not good enough to try it on my own yet

<bordy> max_harmony they don't care, we're still business.

<bordy> I hate to do this again, but Ohio always meets at Panera

* bordy is an Ubuntu Ohio Fanboy

<Epidemic> I think if you're actually serious about having it at a place like that, you
should confirm it's ok with the manager

<ElementC> we all are

<ElementC> parks have no managers

<max_harmony> and what Ohio does affects us how? They have snow

<Epidemic> I ment the manager of panera

<bordy> epidemic of course, we call ahead

<bordy> I only recommend somewhere like that for the WiFi and food

<ElementC> potluck

<ElementC> and... darn

<bordy> Alot of us will be drivin a long way

* bordy will brb.

<Mike_F> i know just about all the free internet around east orlando

* ep2011 would have to get driven 3 hrs there, I doubt I'd be able to go unless we were
going to disney (Annual passes)

<ElementC> I don't. My school has free wifi

<Epidemic> a little war driving huh?

<ElementC> so I never have to worry

<ElementC> no, they don't care between classes and before the first bell

<ElementC> actually, I converted a few teachers this week

<Epidemic> my uni doesn't care at all about their wifi

<ElementC> THAT was hard work

<max_harmony> I vote tally.

<Epidemic> tally is 6 hours from me

<ep2011> max_harmony, It wouldn't be fair to south floridians

<ep2011> Id have to drive 6+ hrs

<ep2011> Orlando is best for everyone, tops is like 4 hrs for anyone

<max_harmony> And it has nothing to do with the fact it gives me ~0 travel time.

<max_harmony> Really

<pak33m> i vote ocala...seems like 1/2 way mabe

<Epidemic> ep2011: unless you're in the keys hehe...

<ElementC> I don't vote

<max_harmony> We have the capitol, two unis and a community college.

<ElementC> I just avoid sunlight

<ElementC> it's in the job title

<Epidemic> yeah, but where I live has a beach... although some people might not want to be
seen there, I dunno ;)

<pak33m> how bout a borders was that discussed yet i came here late

<ElementC> Epidemic: that's me

<Epidemic> borders doesn't have free wifi

<ElementC> I could do a bookstore

<ElementC> Barnes + noble does

<ep2011> Barnes and Nobles

* ep2011 high fives ElementC

<ElementC> thank you kindly

<pak33m> how bout a cool guy coffe shop they have to hae ree wifi

<max_harmony> I couldn't get on it with ubuntu last time i tried

<Epidemic> but barnes and nobles wont be happy with maybe 15 people all talking to eachother

<ElementC> what's the syntax for the action stuff?

<Epidemic> /me

<ElementC> they dont mind during Harry potter release night

* ElementC tests the action command

<ElementC> YES!

<Epidemic> but there's not a harry potter release night as often as we'd like :P

<ElementC> there's one in june, I think

<ElementC> and there's always Empire and Artemis Fowl VI

* max_harmony checks countdown

<max_harmony> 75 days

<pak33m> how bout a hotel with free wifi...i stayed in a spinghill suites mariott in
ashville nc & connected right up...we could take over the lobby (and bar)

* Epidemic is scared of Harry Potter fans

* ElementC agrees.

<ElementC> pak33m: I dunno. hotels are not that welcoming

<ElementC> I still say parks

<pak33m> why not do the FL thing and find a disney place

<Epidemic> most parks don't have wifi

<ElementC> good point

<pak33m> the hotels should

<ElementC> hey... Cypress gardens

<Mike_F> i thought that closed

<ElementC> nope

<ElementC> still alive and kicking.

<pak33m> is cypress gardens that far ahead with technology

* max_harmony uses imperious curse on ElementC and Epidemic and forces them to enjoy the
entire series, then slap each other with trouts

<Epidemic> isn';t that somewhere near orlando?

<ElementC> I tried to get wifi in a resturaunt there once with a DS

* ElementC deflects it with a PS3

<pak33m> if were meeting do we really need wifi access

<ElementC> uh... kinda...

<ElementC> nope

* max_harmony takes PS3 and installs linux on it

<ElementC> not at all

<Epidemic> wifi owuld be a plus

<ElementC> not not necessary

<max_harmony> And BTW ElementC, why isn't linux already on it?

<ElementC> It's not mine

<ElementC> I would never steal a sony product

<ElementC> er... buy

<Epidemic> ...

<ElementC> this is really off topic

<pak33m> i just went to a lug meeting the other day where we watched a presenation on
gnucash non wifi needed, even though it was there

<Epidemic> someone get some 5 finger discounts over there?

<ElementC> nope.

<ElementC> I borowed it from a friend

<ElementC> he thanks you

<ElementC> for the linux

<ElementC> diferent subject?

<bordy> BTW Cypress Gardens is in WinterHaven, near Lakeland

<bordy> Think we're pretty much done, covered all agenda topics and a meetup

<ElementC> What's the Trade work system?

<bordy> No idea, Nate isn't here to tell us

<ElementC> that stinks

<bordy> on that note, PLEASE everybody add to the agenda as things pop into your head so we
remember to talk about them at the next meeting

* max_harmony drives 100 miles to the original topic

<Mike_F> are we going to the weekly thing

<Mike_F> next week

<bordy> Yes we are. Every sunday at 8, but the first one of the month we should really ALL
try to get here, to be the most productive

<bordy> and cohesive

<ElementC> I will (probably be there

<Mike_F> including tonight ?

<bordy> meh, I'll be here if anyone shows

<pak33m> im assuming 8 pm on sun

<ElementC> I'll be here for a while

<pak33m> sorry i came in late

<ElementC> I'll be away... but here

<bordy> no worries, at least you came pak33m ;)

<bordy> Alright, gonna call this one over so I can take a nap

<bordy> thanks for comin out guys

<max_harmony> let's not have "meetings" anymore

<bordy> *** END MEETING ***
