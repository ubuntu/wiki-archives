__TOC__

At the June 6th Tampa Meet-up we discussed having a build day for the August 2009 meet-up. Quinnco is in need of financial support in order for them to gain their 501c3 status. This will allow for them to take donations and in return give tax right-offs to big businesses that are in need of this for donating devices to this note-worthy charity.

This will become the page to look to find out details on the build days, and other events that are going to happen with Qimo events.
