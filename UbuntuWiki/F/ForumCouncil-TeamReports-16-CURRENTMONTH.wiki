=== An update from the Forums Council for June 2016 ===

==== New Ubuntu Members via forums contributions ====

The Forum Council is proud to announce two new Ubuntu memberships obtained through forum contributions.

Please welcome our newest Members, <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/member.php?u=767164|Rex Bouwense]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/member.php?u=449866|vasa1]]</nowiki>. You can see Rex Bouwense’s application thread <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2327074|here]]</nowiki> and vasa1's application thread <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2328129|here]]</nowiki>.

They both have been long time contributors and have always showed sustained and helpful contributions to the forums.

If you have been a contributor to the forums and wish to apply to Ubuntu Membership, all you have to do is to put together a wiki and Launchpad pages, sign the Ubuntu Code of Conduct and follow the process outlined in the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Forums/Membership|Ubuntu Membership via Forums contributions]]</nowiki> wiki page.
<<BR>>
If, due to the present community wiki lock down, you got stuck and thus unable to set up your own wiki pages, please feel free to get in touch with a <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/showgroups.php/|member of the staff]]</nowiki>, through a PM in the forums, and ask for help regarding it. 

Should you wish to add items to the Forums Council agenda here is the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ForumCouncilAgenda|link]]</nowiki>.
