__TOC__

I studied Computer Science (called "Informatik" in Germany) at the University of Bremen, Germany
from 1981 to 1985.  My Interest in Linux started in 1993.  I'm using Linux since 1994 and started
to use Ubuntu as my favorite distribution with Dapper Drake.  Currently (September 2007) I'm 
running 7.04 Feisty Fawn on my personal Laptop.  I live in a rural section of northern germany.

If asked questions, I will try to answer them as my time permits.  
My E-Mail address is pf at artcom-gmbh.de.
