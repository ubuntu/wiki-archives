__TOC__

A relatively new Linux user that hates Vista.  I tried Mandrake Linux back in the 300 MHz days but it was too difficult to do anything useful quickly.

Lately, I have been tracking Ubuntu's process from Edgy Eft through Hardy Heron and I can say that Ubuntu is now ready for the desktop.

I am very interested to see how much Windows software can be replaced (and by what) and also how to get some other Windows software and emulators to work.  I will try to chronicle anything interesting here if I have time (which I probably won't... ;) )
