My <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~pvr|Launchpad profile]]</nowiki> with contact information.

I am a belgian student. (Computing and systems - Network and telecommunications in Liège, ie. Code monkey training!)

I was active with Ubuntu for a little over two years, but my studies have taken up all my time recently. Nevertheless, a return to active FOSS contribution is more than likely.

My Ubuntu contributions lie in the spreadubuntu project, translation and local Ubuntu-related events.
