__TOC__

Currently a freelance systems administrator that resides in the United States in the sunshine state.  I have been a linux user since 1997 and an ubuntu user for about 2 years now.   As time progresses I will add to this page a few things.  Primary goal at this time is evaluation of the programs that I use on a daily basis and also the day to day use of other programs in systems administration.   Check back from time to time for tips and tricks that can be used by almost anyone.

Cheers
