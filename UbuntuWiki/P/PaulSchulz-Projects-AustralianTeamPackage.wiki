== Specification - ubuntu-au package ==

Author: PaulSchulz

Proposed Package: ubuntu-au

Status: DRAFT - comments welcome

The aim is to collect a set of useful documents for Australians
and Australian residents, managed by the Ubuntu-Au team, which can be downloaded in a 'ubuntu-au' package.

This may include the documents themselves, or a set of scripts to download
resources from the internet as required.

This could be used as a model for other Loco Teams.
