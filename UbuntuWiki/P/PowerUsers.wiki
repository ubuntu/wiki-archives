Welcome to the '''Ubuntu Power User Community''' project! Our goal is to help power users to get the most out of Ubuntu. We want to provide a place for power users to communicate, document configuration functionality, and provide tools for tweaking the system.

=== Who is a Power User? ===
A Power User is someone who likes to tweak the user interface, is not afraid of changing the default settings or install useful extensions. But a Power User doesn't necessary need to know how to code or compile a package from source code. A Power User is just a user... with power.
