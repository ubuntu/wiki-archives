Hey y'all~

I am a student in Technological Educational Institute at Applied Informatics and Multimedia department. I'm here to participate in summer university and help to develop a toolkit on "Learning the Open Source Way" which organized by FLOSSCom and Ubuntu teams. I look forward to exchange knowledge and experience.

Regards.
