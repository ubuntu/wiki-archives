''Aside from being free, the open-source Ubuntu release 11.04 codenamed Natty Narwhal" touts the improved graphical user interface (GUI) dubbed "Unity." "Over other Linux desktop [distributions], Ubuntu has the advantage of being easy-to-use, as well as having a solid infrastructure underneath. Ubuntu also has a broader coverage of language support, with the widely used Unicode as the default character encoding" Zak Elep, head of Ubuntu Philippine Team Local Community (LoCoTeam) said in a statement.''

== Natty Manila Release Party ==

ZakElep organized a Manila Release Party for NattyNarwhal last July 1 at Orange and Bronze Software Labs:

Activities were simple: First, food:

ZakElep rambled a bit about some of the new features of Natty, not the least showing off <a href="http://unity.ubuntu.com/">Unity</a> (the new face of Ubuntu,) but also featuring a few tools that he uses in a daily basis, such as <a href="http://virt-manager.et.redhat.com/">virt-manager</a>.

Then we had a Q-and-A session.  Someone raised a question about porting enterprise software (an airline ticketing system running on Windows) to Ubuntu, as there was a participant who belonged to the company who developed that software.  There was also some questions about Unity and its impact on Ubuntu's next release; thankfully, UX Master AllanCaeg was there to answer :)

Then finally, we distributed the pressed CDs from Canonical for the LoCoTeam.  A box of CDs were previously shipped to Yolynne Medina for her <nowiki>[[http://ubuntu-ph.org/node/7831|own release party]]</nowiki> held the week prior.

Too bad we didn't get to have a group pic at the end though.  Still, it was fun, connecting with a new group of people (as well as seeing old buddies show up for a bit.)
