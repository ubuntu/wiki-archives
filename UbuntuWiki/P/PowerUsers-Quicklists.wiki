__TOC__

Users are putting together some awesome static quicklists. This page is to keep track of which .desktop files we're sending to upstreams and their status so we can ship them in 11.10.

Basically jot down your favorite app, make a quicklist .desktop for it, and then file a bug with the project upstream and see if they'll accept it. (Don't worry about default applications, most of those have <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/desktop-o-default-apps-unity-integration|been assigned]]</nowiki>.

* "Driver" means that you're going to take the responsibility of walking the quicklist upstream, filing the bug report, answering their questions, and asking for help if upstream needs recommendations from design or ubuntu engineering if they want to do dynamic quicklists, etc. (Basically, be there for them.)
