Ubuntu Peru is a growing community of enthusiasts. We have always more people coming on board as we have presence on most of the Free Software events here.

=== Roadmap ===

==== Already Implemented ====
* ''<nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-pe-council|Peruvian LoCo Council]]</nowiki>'' - The Peruvian Loco Council is the primary community governance body for our community. This group determines the structure, the norms and procedures within the project. The new positions in the Council are nominated by any of its members , confirmed and voted by the other members of the Peruvian LoCo Council.

* ''<nowiki>[[http://wiki.ubuntu-pe.org/eventos|Meetings]]</nowiki>'' - Meetings every two weeks discussing the state of the community and the different services, as well as proposals for new activities and topics of the Ubuntu-PE community. Meetings will be at #ubuntu-pe on irc.freenode.net

* ''<nowiki>[[http://wiki.ubuntu-pe.org/distribucion-de-cds|Help distribute shipit CDs locally]]</nowiki>'' - 	Distribution of Ubuntu CDs locally with help of "ubunteros" in all possible regions of our contry, reaching the greater possible audience.

* ''Organize Talks and Installfests'' - Organize conferences and Install fests localy so more people know/learn more about ubuntu.

* ''<nowiki>[[http://picasaweb.google.com/xander21c|Participate on talks and conferences]]</nowiki>'' - On Peru there are lots of talks and conferences, we plan to be there helping and having a Stand where we can show ubuntu working, gift CD's with ubuntu and the derivate distros (eg. kubuntu, xubuntu, etc...) so more people knows about them.

==== For Implementation ====
* ''Friendly Hardware'' - We want to contact local retailers and help them setup PCs and laptops that are 100% Ubuntu friendly and help users find them easily. <nowiki>[[http://picasaweb.google.com/xander21c/InstallPartyLimaOrganizacion/photo#5125768455019892274|We have contacted to specialized stores (Saga Flabella, Ripley)]]</nowiki> , leaving publicity about ubuntu and the importance of the free software for the home users.

* ''Translations'' - In the Peruvian Team there are two Official Ubuntu Spanish Translators, <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~gcamposm|P3L|C4N0]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~andreserl|RoAkSoAx]]</nowiki>. They, as   official translators, are trying to get other Peruvian LoCo Members involved with Translations. They are showing them a nice way to help the Ubuntu Community. This way, we are trying to promote Contributions to the Ubuntu Community among members of the LoCo Team, so that way, they can get more involved in the project and not just in the LoCo Team, so that in a near future we have more Peruvian Contributors for Spanish Translations. We also aiming to promote the Quechua translation in a effort to reach some not spanish speakers of our country.

* ''Development'' - In the Peruviam Team, we also have one official Ubuntu Member and a contributor of the Ubuntu Server Team, <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~nvalcarcel|Nxvl]]</nowiki>, who is also on his way to become a MOTU Developer. He, with help of the LoCo Council, is trying to get other Peruvian LoCo Members involved with Ubuntu Development, giving talks in different Universities among Lima - Perú. We, as a LoCo Team, are trying to promote Contributions to Ubuntu Development so this way we can get a Peruvian Developer Team contributing to Ubuntu with support of some local University Labs.
