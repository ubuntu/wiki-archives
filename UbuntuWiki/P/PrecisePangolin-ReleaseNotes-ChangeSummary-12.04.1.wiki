__TOC__


This is a brief summary of bugs fixed between Ubuntu 12.04 and 12.04.1. '''This summary covers only changes to packages in ''__main__'' and ''__restricted__'', which account for all packages in the officially-supported CD images; there are further changes to various packages in ''universe'' and ''multiverse''.''' Some of these fixes were by Ubuntu developers directly, while others were by upstream developers and backported to Ubuntu. For full details, see the individual package changelogs.

In addition to the bugs listed below, this update includes all security updates from the <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/precise|Ubuntu Security Notice list]]</nowiki> affecting Ubuntu 12.04 LTS that were released up to and including August 16, 2012. The last updates included were USN-1482-3 (ClamAV regression).

=== Installation bug fixes ===

Updated CD images are provided with this release, including fixes for some installation bugs. (Many installation problems are hardware-specific; for those, see "Hardware support bugs" below.)

|-
| ubuntu-defaults-builder
| Bug:988836
| lib/language-support-hook: Do not remove language support packages for requested languages. Some language support packages are needed by several languages (most notably poppler-data), so we must not remove those, otherwise we will also remove reverse dependencies. E. g. ubuntu-defaults-zh-cn depends on poppler-data, which we removed before as poppler-data is _also_ a support package for -pt and -en.
|-
| ubuntu-defaults-zh-cn
| Bug:1036994

=== Upgrade bug fixes ===

These changes fix upgrade issues, smoothing the way for future upgrades to later releases of Ubuntu.
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| accountsservice
| Bug:1021293
| don't try restarting the service from the maintainer script after upgrades, it leads to some issues and shouldn't be needed since it will be dbus reactivated when needed
|-
| apt
| Bug:1013128
| adjust apt-key to ensure no collisions on subkeys too. Patch thanks to Marc Deslauriers.
|-
| apt-clone
| Bug:1029021
| if specified remove usernames and passwords from sources files
|-
| aptdaemon

|-
| cyrus-sasl2
| Bug:990742
| Fix ABI incompatability during slapd upgrades.
|-
| grub2
| Bug:978464
| Switch to backwards compatible ${} syntax for grub.cfg
|-
| launchpad-integration
| Bug:1029531
| Add Breaks: libbrasero-media0 to liblaunchpad-integration-3.0-1, required to get the dist-upgrader to resolve lucid -> precise. Unversioned breaks as the package last existed in lucid.
|-
| libzeitgeist
| Bug:986191
| 11.04 → 12.04 upgrade] Dash is always empty due to zeitgeist crash: Unable to upgrade from schema version 3
|-
| nspr
| Bug:1029531
| Add Breaks: evolution-plugins (<``< 3.2.0-0ubuntu2) to libnspr4, required to get the dist-upgrader to resolve lucid -> precise.
|-
| nspr
| Bug:1036794
| language-support-LANG was still around in 11.04 so the previous change is requiring a dist-upgrade for any user who upgraded from 11.04 to 11.10 and then to 12.04, instead of being limited to machines that were originally installed with 9.04 as was planned. Removing language-support-LANG from the Breaks, which should resolve the issue for these users while still removing language-support-translations on systems.
|-
| nspr
| Bug:1036794
| Add additional Conflicts: on the obsolete evolution-documentation-* packages, which are held back on some users' systems despite being obsolete before 10.04; and also on the matching language-support-translations-* and language-support-* packages.  This should ensure libnspr is getting upgraded, instead of evolution being held back.
|-
| resolvconf
| Bug:989585
| Instead of throwing an error that aborts the upgrade when /etc/resolv.conf is immutable, pop a debconf error message to let the user know what's happening, then clear the immutable flag and continue with the installation.
|-
| rpcbind
| Bug:863741
| No-change rebuild of rpcbind so we can publish with a different version number to precise-updates, allowing apt to see that this package is Priority: standard so it will be installed in favor of portmap on upgrade.
|-
| rpcbind
| Bug:875471
| Fix to look directly in /run instead of via the /var/run symlink which is not guaranteed to be present yet when the job starts when /var is a separate partition; and include a versioned dependency on initscripts to ensure proper upgrade ordering.
|-
| update-manager
| Bug:1029531
| Fix removal_blacklist to blacklist "^screen$" instead of "screen". This fixes cases where the upgrade would fail because of a package containing "screen" being removed.
|-
| update-manager
| Bug:1029046
| Call clone.save_state with scrub_sources set so that Var``Log``Dist``Upgrade``Aptclonesystemstate will be included in bug reports again

|-
| update-notifier
| Bug:1003100
| po/*.po: the string '$packages' must not be translated, but we currently have no way to mark the string as such in the input files.
|-
| update-notifier
| Bug:993672
| data/package-data-downloads-failed{,-permanently}.in: work around a bug in intltool-merge rfc822deb handling that causes wrong syntax when the first line in the file is a translated field.
|-

| Initialize usblp_attached field in printer data structure to assure that detaching and re-attaching the usblp kernel module is always done correctly. Blacklist the "usblp" kernel module again. We have now a full-featured USB backend based on the maintained libusb 1.0.x and so we can acess printers always through the raw USB devices making the module deprecated. Detaching the kernel module for each access causes a lot of problems.
|-
| cups

|-
| cups
| Bug:987485 <<BR>> Bug:997040
| Added additional quirks for the Prolific Technology USB -> Parallel adapter, as the adapter needs uni-directional mode to be forced and also does not like re-attaching the usblp kernel module after the job (last third of last page gets cut off, re-attaching probably sends a reset to the printer while there is still data to be printed in the printer's internal buffer.  Do a printer reset after each job, this makes the Prolific USB -> Parallel adapter finally work and makes it unnecessary to blacklist the usblp kernel module for some printers.  Correct loops to repeat claiming interfaces on USB devices when they are busy. Before, hitting busy state made the device opening function error out without comment.  Protect against crashes by checking error codes of libusb functions and detach usblp kernel module in an earlier stage when opening a device.
|-
| cups
| Bug:1000253 <<BR>> Bug:1001028
| Support for uni-directional devices, both protocol-1 devices and devices where no read endpoint is found.
|-
| cups
| Bug:1000253
| Added the quirk management of the usblp kernel module. So the problems of all printers which were worked around in the kernel module are also worked around in the libusb-based CUPS backend now.  Added new quirk type to quirk manager: Printers for which the usblp kernel module should not get reattached after printing a job.
|-
| cups
| Bug:1000253
| As we have vastly improved the USB backend, we lift the blacklisting again as it is not needed any more. This way users with proprietary third-party backends based on /dev/usb/lp* device files can print again. The problems which we have worked around with the first SRU for Precise are now actually fixed in the USB backend.
|-
| cups
| Bug:1001028
| Added option "usb-unidir" to force the backend into uni-directional mode. This allows to work around problems with bi-di communications, especially also a delay at the end of the job caused by closing the read channel (happens only for some devices). Also useful for debugging.
|-
| cups
| Bug:1032456
| The clean-up reset after the job was not actually sent for Samsung printers. Let the USB backend only send a clean-up reset after the job if it is really needed.

| debian/rules: Set default renderer for the pdftops filter to Poppler due to many printer's buggy interpreters having problems with Ghost``Script's Post``Script and set image rendering resolution limit of the pdftops filter to 360 dpi to prevents slow processing by the printer if very high resolutions are used or if the printing resolution is mis-detected by the pdftops filter.

| pdftops: Start determining the printing resolution with cupsRasterInterpretPPD(), this is the most reliable as often the choice names of the "Resolution" option are marketing names with higher numerical values than the actual resolution. Also ignore error exit values of cupsRasterInterpretPPD() as the function can error out after having found the resolution. pdftops: If printing resolution is determined by cupsRasterInterpretPPD() do not stick on 100 dpi if the resolution cannot be determined.
