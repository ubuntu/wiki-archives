=== Test Plan ===
Autopilot-legacy is a package designed only to be used with Unity7 for backwards compatibility reasons.

==== On the desktop ====
* Build and install packages from the MPs
* Run the autopilot functional and unit tests
* Run the unity 7 test suite.

==== On the device ====

* Nothing is required on the device, since all touch apps are python 3.

=== Dependents/Clients ===

The only project to be affected by changes to autopilot-legacy is Unity7.
