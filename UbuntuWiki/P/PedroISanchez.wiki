==== About Me ====
My name is ''Pedro I. Sanchez,'' living in Canada since 1991, originally in Montreal and in Ottawa since 1997. I work as a system architect, software designer, and project manager in areas related to data communications. I have interest in different topics including mobile and embedded devices, desktop middleware software, GUI toolkits, and system administration.

GNU/Linux has been my only computing environment since 1995 when I installed Debian GNU/LiInux on my old computer. I switched to Ubuntu in 2005. I enjoy working with Linux both at home and at work and also enjoy helping others to jump (and stay) with Linux as their computing environment. I maintain several Ubuntu-based computers at work, my PCs at home (5 already!), and the PCs of several friends for whom I am the "sys admin".
