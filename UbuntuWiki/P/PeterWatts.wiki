Hello. I'm a returned user with an old Acer Aspire 3000. I have taken on the project of learning and using Xubuntu which allows this old machine to work quite well as a hobby. I only have it at home so my available Time is limited but I have years to learn.
Going to spend some time now learning how to help with bugs, hope I'm successful.
