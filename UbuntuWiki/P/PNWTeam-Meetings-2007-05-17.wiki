(07:01:45 PM) dshufelt: most other teams did not have forums before Ubuntu Forums upgraded and started creating sub 
forums for people

(07:01:55 PM) Styles: hmmm

(07:02:10 PM) peanutb: I guess it would be goodpublicity.

(07:02:29 PM) peanutb: to move the forum to ubuntuforums.

(07:02:31 PM) X704: :/

(07:02:57 PM) andrewkk: not to mention we we wouldnt have to worry about maintain them

<<< SNIPPED CUT AND PASTE ACCIDENT >>>

(07:03:42 PM) dshufelt: The part I don't like is that we run the risk of not having as tight of a local community 
(what we've worked so hard to get).

(07:04:19 PM) peanutb: I think Drupal would be good because it also has a blogging engine included.

(07:04:30 PM) H264: heh

(07:04:38 PM) peanutb: for news and such

(07:04:58 PM) ***dshufelt votes drupal either way

(07:05:00 PM) H264: next time I will let you know where I left off

(07:05:07 PM) dshufelt: :D

(07:05:50 PM) peanutb: k ill get it set up soon (probably this weekend)

(07:05:54 PM) H264: whatever works

(07:06:03 PM) dshufelt: exactly... no rush

(07:06:43 PM) dshufelt: what's every-ones' take on the forums?

(07:06:53 PM) H264: whatever works

(07:06:58 PM) H264: ;)

(07:07:19 PM) dshufelt: there are benefits / drawbacks either way.

(07:08:16 PM) andrewkk: could be problems with matching users between pnw's site and ubuntu forums'?

(07:08:37 PM) dshufelt: yeah... This is a sticky one.

(07:08:38 PM) dshufelt: /votes not to fix what isn't broken without a good reason

(07:08:57 PM) peanutb: /agrees

(07:09:02 PM) ***dshufelt is trying to make new IRC commands

(07:09:19 PM) MISTERTibbs: ditto

(07:09:31 PM) NaNO2x: /aswell

(07:09:47 PM) andrewkk: although.. it might be better to make the switch sooner rather than later if we think we might at all ever want to use ubuntu's forums

(07:09:55 PM) H264: /whatever++

(07:10:33 PM) ***peanutb thinks we need more publicity and the forums are a great way.

(07:10:44 PM) dshufelt: that is a good point but I think I should have done more work weighing pros and cons before bringing it up.

(07:10:45 PM) H264: hmm

(07:11:06 PM) peanutb: yah. Lets move on to the next issue

(07:11:24 PM) peanutb: So GSLUG

(07:11:26 PM) dshufelt: why don't we open a PNW thread on the Ubuntu forums and post our happening for others to read?

(07:11:32 PM) dshufelt: best of both worlds.

(07:11:33 PM) NaNO2x: yes gslug :D

(07:11:45 PM) peanutb: I agree.

(07:11:52 PM) MISTERTibbs: absolutely

(07:11:58 PM) NaNO2x: i put that up there because there isnt a lug in seattle or seattle area anymore

(07:12:03 PM) dshufelt: So what's up with GSLUG?

(07:12:06 PM) NaNO2x: the gslug went defunc last year

(07:12:11 PM) NaNO2x: havent seen anything since

(07:12:16 PM) MISTERTibbs: no new posts since 06

(07:12:18 PM) andrewkk: what is gslug?

(07:12:28 PM) MISTERTibbs: greater seattle linux user group

(07:12:58 PM) dshufelt: Who was running / coordinating things?

(07:13:04 PM) NaNO2x: no clue

(07:13:13 PM) peanutb: kmeyer@blarg.net

(07:13:23 PM) peanutb: "Meeting-place wrangler, lead organizer."

(07:13:31 PM) ***dshufelt may have to quit a job just to make time to help all things linux

(07:13:56 PM) H264: dshufelt: how many jobs do you have?

(07:14:01 PM) dshufelt: I'm shooting kmeyer an email now.

(07:14:19 PM) ***peanutb points out http://lists.gslug.org/

(07:14:53 PM) dshufelt: I work for Providence, the ISP and I have some insurance companies and other business that I 
have been supporting since I was 15 built their networks.

(07:15:41 PM) H264: hmm... well either way, don't try to bite off too much

(07:16:01 PM) Styles: going afk for a bit

(07:16:06 PM) NaNO2x: anyway, i could startup a uwlug but i would like to see something for greater area

(07:16:12 PM) peanutb: NaN02x, anything else?

(07:16:30 PM) ***peanutb didnt see the previous line

(07:16:35 PM) NaNO2x: np

(07:16:37 PM) dshufelt: I'm not worried about biting off too much. :)

(07:17:01 PM) NaNO2x: if we cant get ahold of the gslug people, would anyone like to startup a slug or something 
else as that seems dropped

(07:17:21 PM) dshufelt: Well lets contact the GSlug team and see what turns up.

(07:17:33 PM) peanutb: lets do it.

(07:17:34 PM) NaNO2x: aye

(07:17:46 PM) dshufelt: I'm completely willing to help with PDX, Plug and GSlug

(07:18:04 PM) andrewkk: if the greater seattle lug isnt active, i dont think thats a good indicator that a seattle 
lug will be

(07:19:02 PM) NaNO2x: well, i think there are enough people who want to try out linux

(07:19:08 PM) peanutb: I know of ~5-6 people that will be willing to join.

(07:19:19 PM) Styles: btw way we should have topics in both pwn and oregon channels

(07:19:21 PM) ***peanutb points to https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PNWTeam

(07:19:23 PM) NaNO2x: and i know quite a few people in my class

(07:19:27 PM) MISTERTibbs: maybe wait until after a few dozen more people install at parties?

(07:20:24 PM) ***dshufelt clicks send

(07:20:38 PM) peanutb: andrewkk, are you in seattle or bellingham?

(07:21:29 PM) dshufelt: PNW, ID, OR, and WA channels

(07:21:29 PM) H264: Seattle...

(07:21:33 PM) MISTERTibbs: are there ubuntu PNW flyers available for download somewhere?

(07:21:45 PM) NaNO2x: hes in bellingham

(07:21:46 PM) andrewkk: i'm in bellingham at wwu, though i consider my home to be in seattle

(07:22:02 PM) dshufelt: yes from the DIY marketing page.

(07:22:12 PM) dshufelt: just a sec, I'll find the link.

(07:22:15 PM) MISTERTibbs: blush!

(07:22:56 PM) NaNO2x: where is it, looking dont see diy

(07:23:20 PM) peanutb: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DIYMarketing?highlight=%28diymarketing%29

(07:23:22 PM) dshufelt: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DIYMarketing

(07:23:33 PM) andrewkk: peanutb: would it be more appropriate to change my member listing?

(07:23:49 PM) peanutb: andrewkk, i was just curious

(07:25:03 PM) dshufelt: peanutb what do you think about adding an affiliations page to the site?

(07:25:15 PM) peanutb: Im up for it.

(07:25:22 PM) dshufelt: we could then place links to LUGs and such

(07:25:45 PM) peanutb: you know the PW to login if you want to edit the text for it.

(07:25:46 PM) H264: Ah, sounds like a good idea to me :)

(07:25:53 PM) dshufelt: NP

(07:26:06 PM) dshufelt: I'm thinking of making a WIKI page too.

(07:26:50 PM) dshufelt: the WIKI page could outline how and why PNW supports other user groups 

(07:27:42 PM) H264: just put one up and decide the fine print content later :)

(07:28:21 PM) ***peanutb is currently doing that.

(07:28:33 PM) dshufelt: It's not really fine print, just an explanation since I get asked all the time. (lots of 
email for the week that I was both the PNW and OR contact on the Loco wiki)

(07:29:12 PM) MISTERTibbs: 2nd edition of the offiicial ubuntu book will come out 7/07 according to amazon. possible marketing hook??

(07:29:13 PM) dshufelt: OK so Ops / Bots for $1000 anyone?

(07:29:35 PM) peanutb: how about Loco Bot?

(07:29:40 PM) H264: :)

(07:29:45 PM) peanutb: and Chanserv

(07:30:29 PM) dshufelt: what were every-ones thoughts on this?

(07:30:47 PM) H264: on bots?

(07:30:59 PM) ***dshufelt has no real experience with using bots

(07:31:21 PM) peanutb: will set it up in a few secs.

(07:31:34 PM) dshufelt: what are the advantages?

(07:31:47 PM) H264: just the coolness factor

(07:31:52 PM) dshufelt: :D

(07:32:04 PM) dshufelt: :/

(07:32:11 PM) dshufelt: :D

(07:32:22 PM) dshufelt: OK, what will this bot do?

(07:32:45 PM) NaNO2x: serve warze of course :P

(07:32:51 PM) dshufelt: :O

(07:33:07 PM) NaNO2x: j/k of course

(07:33:16 PM) peanutb: loco bot will log the conversations here (do we want that?) and chanserv can give you op 
status whenever you want it.

(07:33:18 PM) dshufelt: apt-get warez wont do?

(07:33:50 PM) ***NaNO2x goes off to try that

(07:33:53 PM) peanutb: i believe it would be apt-get install warez

(07:34:09 PM) peanutb: darn,

(07:34:10 PM) peanutb: Support</a></li>

(07:34:44 PM) andrewkk: (apt-cache search warez gives some interesting results)

(07:35:00 PM) dshufelt: (a package full of PNW pictures)

(07:35:19 PM) H264: hmm

(07:35:39 PM) peanutb: hmm, "a configurable talking cow"

(07:35:59 PM) H264: whos computer does it run on?

(07:36:09 PM) dshufelt: the LocoBot... Where does it save the conversations and can it be set to a cron?

(07:36:35 PM) andrewkk: i've gotten a fair amount of use out of browsing other loco's logs

(07:36:38 PM) peanutb: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBots

(07:37:00 PM) ***peanutb should put a project charter up for the pnw pictures package.

(07:37:02 PM) ***dshufelt thinking of not having to manually clean up all the meeting logs.

(07:37:23 PM) ***dshufelt a slacker that hasn't done it yet

(07:38:20 PM) peanutb: dshufelt, did you register out channel?

(07:38:43 PM) dshufelt: yes

(07:38:58 PM) dshufelt: now if I could only remember what I did...

(07:39:05 PM) peanutb: that explanes it

(07:39:23 PM) dshufelt: password is probably the same as the one for website ftp.

(07:39:29 PM) ***dshufelt hopes

(07:40:05 PM) peanutb: i need you to add me to the list of ops, a simple /msg ChanServ access #ubuntu-pnw add peanutb opp

(07:40:10 PM) peanutb: will do it.

(07:41:02 PM) dshufelt: (07:40:41 PM) ChanServ: (notice) [peanutb] has been added to the access list for #Ubuntu-PNW with level [0]

(07:41:30 PM) peanutb: ok try that again only replace opp with 50 or something

(07:41:33 PM) dshufelt: I'm all for the logger and the opp

(07:41:58 PM) peanutb: sorry, 25

(07:43:29 PM) H264: mixed with the OSU bot

(07:43:35 PM) andrewkk: would we really use that?

(07:43:45 PM) dshufelt: perhaps we could make it so everytime you enter `:\` it says *SLANTY FACE*

(07:43:45 PM) H264: OOOoooo

(07:43:50 PM) H264: you betch ya

(07:44:15 PM) H264: @andrewkk

(07:45:50 PM) H264: I really really like the !s/something/something/g feature of the OSU bot

(07:46:19 PM) NaNO2x: a reverse latin translator for everything we say!

(07:46:28 PM) H264: sure :)

(07:46:31 PM) dshufelt: :D

(07:47:12 PM) H264: yeah, stuff like that could be done :)

(07:47:18 PM) andrewkk: H264: that could get annoying

(07:47:40 PM) H264: I'm just saying you can do some really cool stuff...

(07:47:55 PM) dshufelt: Well do you want to throw together something for us to look at?

(07:48:27 PM) ***dshufelt officially has no time to tackle this one

(07:48:30 PM) H264: umm... I could get the source for the OSU bot... I just want to know how to add one.

(07:49:03 PM) dshufelt: I think we would need someone to host the bot...

(07:50:29 PM) peanutb: you are marked as away for some reason

(07:50:34 PM) NaNO2x: darn didnt work for me :P

(07:51:14 PM) ***dshufelt thinks it runs on the room

(07:51:23 PM) peanutb: dshufelt, how hipocritical, you work for an isp, yet dont use them.

(07:51:39 PM) dshufelt: I live too far away from them.

(07:51:42 PM) NaNO2x: i know the command to op and it didnt op because i dont have the proper level hehe

(07:51:54 PM) dshufelt: I used to but they don't offer service at my current location.

(07:52:35 PM) peanutb has changed the topic to: The Ubuntu PNW team. (Dan, change this with /TOPIC )

(07:52:41 PM) H264: if properly used a bot will not take much bandwidth
