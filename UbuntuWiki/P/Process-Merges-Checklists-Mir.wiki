=== MP Submission Checklist Template ===

'''Note: Please ensure you include the following form filled out and submitted along side your code to the MP ticket.'''

* Answers to checklist questions are desired to be 'yes' but if 'no' or 'not applicable' please expound
* Did you test your feature/code change/bug fix ? what device(s) ?
* Did you break mir server API or ABI and have the relevant bumps to .so and debian docs been made ?
* Did you break mir client API or ABI and have you followed up with the known clients & announced on mir-devel mailing list ?

=== MP Review Checklist Template (aka Silo Wrangling) ===

'''NOTE: MP process should not change as it is currently performed within the Mir team'''

* '''Make sure the projects for a Mir landing are built in the correct order.''' 
** Mir must build first, the platform-api, qtmir, unity-system-compositor. Otherwise the projects may pick up an 'old' Mir already in the archive.
** This can be done by entering the project order in the text box of the jenkins build page for the silo.
* Mir MP submissions will automatically be assigned to mir-team
* In the instance you are not a mir-team member and you've been asked to review
** Are you a component owner of something dependent on Mir, do you see any issue with Mir's change in relation to your component ?? comment as necessary

=== MP Landing Checklist Template ===

* Is the MP approved by at least 1 member of the mir-team
* Are the approvals equal to or greater than the disapprovals
* Ensure CI passes & the checklist is complete, if there are any acceptable failures please explain
* Don't forget to check on Xorg in the case of client API break
* Test build gtk+3.0 and qtubuntu in case of API changes - these must be kept building in the archive
