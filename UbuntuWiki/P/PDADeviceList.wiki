| Have to do a pilot-xfer -l (after every reboot) before gnome-pilot will communicate. Use of new fields on palm will cause sync to crash. Inconsistant/buggy syncing when it doesn't crash.

| I cannot get this to sync more than once per session in Dapper (6.06) and when I do it does a complete rewrite of the Palm info as if it needs a restore after a hard crash. Was working well in Breezy. I have upgraded to Edgy and sync works perfectly with two little quirks: Evolution must not be open for syncing to work, and two copies of gnome-pilot open when the sync button is pressed on the palm. I can live with both.

| Everything seems to work OK, apart from backups. I have the IBM Java software installed. This causes pilot-xfer to crash due to some non-standard filenames in the IBM package. This is fixed in the current (2005-11-01) pilot-link 0.12-pre series but using that software with standard Ubuntu 5.10 packages causes the standard Ubuntu packages to fail in unexpected ways. File installations work OK.

| Synchronises most details OK. Contact/Todo/Calendar categories not sync'd from Treo to Evolution. (There is a bug report for this, almost 5 years old(!), about category syncing. Looks like it should be fixed soon. http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=201167) Backups not tested due to the filename compatability problem with pilot-link. File installations to RAM work OK via gpilot-install-file.

| Gpilot needs to be manually stopped and restarted each time you want to sync. Evolution backup conduit crashes the sync. Evolution calendar conduit seems to be working (no crash) but after the first sync, there is no change on the palm on next syncs. Evolution has trouble handling multiple calendars.

Might not be a bad idea to add OS Version for Palm OS based devices. It will give us a better idea which versions need work.

I second the idea of adding OS version. If a space is made or a standard for posting it communicated I'll add the info to my entry.

OS Version section added, have fun
