=== Libertine legacy application sandbox for Ubuntu Personal ===

This is a new tool targeted for the Pocket Desktop.

==== Test Plan ====

Changes for ubuntu-app-launch are required for Pocket Desktop integration.  These changes should not be visible on a non-Pocket Desktop image and should not affect any existing functionality.  The full test plan to verify changes in ubuntu-app-launch are found <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Process/Merges/TestPlan/ubuntu-app-launch|at the ubuntu-app-launchh test plan page]]</nowiki>.

No QA test of the Libertine package proper is necessary at this time.
