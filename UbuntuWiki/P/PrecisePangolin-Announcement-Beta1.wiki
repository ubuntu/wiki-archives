The Ubuntu team is pleased to announce the first beta release of Ubuntu
12.04 LTS (Long-Term Support) Desktop, Server, Cloud, and Core products.

Codenamed "Precise Pangolin", 12.04 continues Ubuntu's proud tradition 
of integrating the latest and greatest open source technologies into a
high-quality, easy-to-use Linux distribution.  The team has been hard 
at work through this cycle, introducing new features and fixing bugs.

This release introduces a new set of images for the ARMv7 "hard float"
ABI, denoted as armhf.  There are still some armel images around, as
we finish the migration, but 12.04 for ARM will be based on armhf.

The technology that allows GPUs to go into a very low power consumption 
state when the GPU is idle (RC6) is now enabled by default for 
Sandy Bridge systems, which should result in considerable power savings 
when this stage is activated.

The CD image size has been adjusted to 703MB to squeeze in every
bit of package goodness we can on the installation CD images.

With Ubuntu 12.04,  Kubuntu, Edubuntu, Xubuntu, Lubuntu, and 
Ubuntu Studio also reached Beta 1 status today.

   Nautilus support has been added to the Unity launcher.

* Support for ClickPad devices has been enhanced an now when a button
