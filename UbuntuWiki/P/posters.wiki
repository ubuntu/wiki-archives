==== Introduction ====

We are bouncing around ideas for what a Ubuntu poster campaign might look like and are looking for your ideas and messages.

The campaign would seek to get both home and business users interested in Ubuntu.  The message would have to work as a normal billboard and be readable at a distance ( i.e. ~ 7 words or fewer)

Your suggestions are sought!

| Ubuntu - Free software made simple<<FootNote(This is not particularly powerful, and I don't like the way that it suggests that free software might not always be simple, but I feel that the message should ideally (1) not mention linux, and (2) emphasise the strengths of Ubuntu, which are freedom, and usability. Alternatives might be something like "''Ubuntu - Great software can be free''" or "''Ubuntu - free your computer''" --Matt)>>

==== Campaign Ideas ====

* Keep a seperate poster campaign to target the home user. Maybe individual pictures of people (with their machines) from each continent each carrying a different slogan along the lines of "Taste freedom, Experience Ubuntu!", or "Ubuntu is Hot 'N Happening !" and so on..

* Extend the Ubuntu circle and leave an open space, with two people reaching out to the viewer and asking : "Want to join the Ubuntu circle?" or "Be a part of the Ubuntu circle", "Come, join the Ubuntu circle!", etc...
