=== Interests ===

I'm interested in:

* all art (think icons, wallpapers, splash screens, GDM themes and so forth)
* the user interface and the user experience
* accessibility and usability
* the Human theme (I enjoy using brown earthy tones)

I use both GNOME and KDE, so Kubuntu and KubuntuArtwork are of interest to me as well.
