=== About Me ===

I am a '''computer networks''' and '''operating systems''' teacher at a Portuguese university and promoter of open source and Linux. I've been using Linux on a daily basis for quite some time now and I've always been a fan of Gnome. My first Linux installation was in the 1999, no Ubuntu at that time! 

Having a technical background and because I want to give back to the community, I'm here to help!
