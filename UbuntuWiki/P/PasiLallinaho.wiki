==== Outside Ubuntu ====
Before Xubuntu, I worked with user support and the '''Rokymotion''' marketing team in the <nowiki>[[https://amarok.kde.org/|Amarok]]</nowiki> project for about two years from 2006 to 2008.

In 2010, I founded the <nowiki>[[https://shimmerproject.org|Shimmer Project]]</nowiki> with ''Steve Dodier''. The Shimmer Project is still contributing artwork for Xubuntu, but has since gathered much broader audience. Maintained projects include the '''Albatross''', '''Bluebird''' and '''Greybird''' desktop suites and the "Shimmer" layout, extension and modification for <nowiki>[[https://gmusicbrowser.org/|gmusicbrowser]]</nowiki>.

I've also been working on some <nowiki>[[https://wordpress.knome.fi/|WordPress plugins]]</nowiki>.
