__TOC__

In order to submit patches for the ubuntu network-manager patches follow the following instructions.

 1. branch the package from bzr and cd into it <pre>
bzr branch https://code.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-core-dev/network-manager/ubuntu.0.6.x network-manager.debian
cd network-manager.debian
</pre>
 1. apply all currently existing patches: <pre>
ln -s debian/patches
quilt push -a
</pre>
 1. create a new patch: <pre>
quilt new XX_your_new_patch_name.patch
</pre>
 1. register the files you want to modify '''before''' actually modifying them, e.g. <pre>
quilt add src/NetworkManagerUtils.h
quilt add src/NetworkManagerUtils.c
quilt add src/nm-ap-security.c
</pre>
 1. then edit the files and refresh the patch after you have applied your changes <pre>
quilt refresh --diffstat -U8 --no-timestamps
</pre>
 1. you can then build the package and if you find your modifications could be improved, just edit the files or register new ones (using quilt add like above); after your modifications are finished, refresh your patch again <pre>
quilt refresh --diffstat -U8 --no-timestamps
</pre>

After you finished the patch just open a launchpad bug to track the inclusion of this bug.

You can either attach the <code>debian/patches/XX_your_new_patch_name.patch</code> patch or create a bzr branch in launchpad where you push your ready-to-be-merged package (with the new patch) to. Remember to post your bzr branch url to the bug when submitting your fix through bzr.
