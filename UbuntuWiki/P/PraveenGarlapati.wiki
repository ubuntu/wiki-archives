__TOC__

I am an Open Source enthusiast. Open Source forms a part of my life.

I use, contribute and evangelize Ubuntu/Kubuntu, Firefox and many others.
My primary work is on Translating various softwares into Telugu, which is my mother tongue and primary language.

I also file bug reports and provide supporting information to them as necessary.
Though not regularly I support the Ubuntu forums.
