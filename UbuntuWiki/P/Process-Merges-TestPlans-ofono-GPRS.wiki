== Basic GPRS Tests ==

=== 1. Mobile Data Connection Established ===

==== Purpose ====
This test case verifies that mobile data is established automatically on a phone with a valid SIM card, in an area where the carrier network associated with the SIM is available.

==== Steps: ====

* boot phone
* ensure that WiFi is disabled
* From a terminal on the phone, run ''list-modems''
** Verify that ConnectionManager's '''Powered''' and '''Attached''' properties are both set to '''1''', and that a valid '''Bearer''' technology ( eg. ''edge'', ''hpsa'', ... ) is listed
** Verify that ''Powered'' in the SIM-specific GPRS settings file ( ''/var/lib/ofono/<IMSI>/gprs'' ) is set to ''true''
* From a terminal on the phone, run ''nmcli d''
** Verify that ''/ril_0'' is ''connected''
* From a terminal on the phone, run ''ip route''
** Verify that a default route is set for the modem device ( ''rmnet_usb0'' on mako, ''ccmni0'' on krillin/arale, ... )

=== 2. Verify Simultaneous Mobile Data and Voice ===

==== Purpose ====
This test case verifies that mobile data can be used when a voicecall is active ( this only works for 3g or greater radio tech ).  

'''Note''' - dual-standby modems such as that used in the BQ Aquaris E4.5, cannot use different SIMs simultaneously for mobile data and voice.  For instance, if the mobile data connection is active for SIM1 ( ie. data is actively being sent/received ), then incoming calls to SIM2 will be prevented ( ie. go straight to voicemail, or the caller told the person is unavailable ).  This doesn't apply to outgoing calls, as if one is initiated using SIM2, it would cause the data connection for SIM1 to be quiesced while the voicecall is active.

==== Steps: ====

* boot phone
* ensure that WiFi is disabled
* Establish a voice call on the DUT
* Open the browser and verify that the device is still online
* From a terminal on the phone, run ''nmcli d''
** Verify that ''/ril_0'' is still ''connected''

== Future GPRS Test Scenarios ==

Here are a few areas which could be used to test GPRS.

* Bearer Technology preference tests
* Bearer Technology reporting tests ( eg. gprs, edge, lte, hspa, hsupa, hsdpa, … )
* GPRS Connection Testing
* GPRS Performance Testing
