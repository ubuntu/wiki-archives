__TOC__

I've been working exclusively using Free Software since 1997, and I plan to keep it that way :)

If your boredom ever reaches a critically low level, feel free to take a look at my website.

I manage Free Software development projects at the Zürich University of the Arts (http://www.zhdk.ch). Sometimes I write code, which I use to scare the real developers. I'm also involved in setting up a series of processes and best practices for software development in our extremely heterogeneous environment. Fun!
