~+++++Pyae Sone+++++~

'''=Hello...='''
I am Pyae Sone from Myanmar. My nick is Gipsy(ဂ်စ္ပဆီ). In 2008, Ko Ko Ye Introduced me the Ubuntu. After seeing the effects, i like Ubuntu. So I became Ubuntu user.

'''==About Me=='''
Now, I am working at One of the Internet Cafe(Tha Pyay San Internet Cafe). My hometown is Namtu(North Shan State). Now i am  living @Yangon. 
I want to live my life as simplest. I was born in Namtu Township. After I had finished my primary school, we moved from that town to Yangon. I started learning computer from some non-organization at grade 10. That is computer basic course. After my matriculation exam, I attended again in some basic courses. After that course, I am using computer in National Resource Centre (MM). In 2008, I had met a forum named MYSTERYZILLION. I found many friends in there both online and offline. At that time, I met with Ko Ko Ye. He introduce me What is Ubuntu, Opensource, etc... So, I try to study Ubuntu from 2008. When I started working in an internet cafe, I want to contribute Ubuntu Community. So I started again to translate Ubuntu into our language Myanmar. At that time , localization percentage is only 3 percent finished . Now finished localization percentage is near 15 %. Most Ubuntu UI is with our language.

'''===Ubuntu=== '''
Ubuntu: I like it. B'coz of the opensource, effects, and many many........

Ubuntu offers us to localize and to use ubuntu with our language. When every OS or company do not emphasize in our burmese, Ubuntu stand with us to localize, to use ubuntu with burmese language. I like it more.
