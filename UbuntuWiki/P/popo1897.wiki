I'm a graduate student of the <nowiki>[[http://www.bun.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en/|Graduate School of Letters, Kyoto University]]</nowiki> and major in the military history (19-20th century British army).

=== Contributions ===

* Translation
** I have contributed to Ubuntu as a Japanese translator on launchpad.net since 2011 and was approved as a member of the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-l10n-ja |Ubuntu Japanese Translator team]]</nowiki> in 2012.
** I also contributed to the GNOME upstream sometimes (example: <nowiki>[[https://l10n.gnome.org/vertimus/brasero/master/help/ja|brasero help]]</nowiki>).

* Translator Team Administration
** I have been an administrator of the Ubuntu Japanese Translator Team since 2013 and administered the team.
** Currently, I am engaging in the rearrange of and the documentation of rules, routines and procedures about translation in Japanese LoCo. 

* Release Note Translation
** I have committed to the translation of the release notes after I was approved as the member of the team.
** As an administrator of the team, I have also managed translation of the release notes(<nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TrustyTahr/ReleaseNotes/Ja|14.04]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UtopicUnicorn/ReleaseNotes/Ja|14.10]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/VividVervet/ReleaseNotes/Ja|15.04]]</nowiki>).

=== Future Goals ===

I will continue to advance the rearrange and the documentation, then more people can take part in Ubuntu more easily.

I think some important information in the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com|English wiki site]]</nowiki> is not available in Japanese. This situation prevents some people from easy use and understanding of and participation in Ubuntu. It should be translated into Japanese. To achieve  it is the other of my missions.
