=== Garry Parker ===

I live and work in Manchester, UK. I'm the author of a popular Ubuntu MythTV guide and also created   Ubuntu Satanic Edition. It's kind of tongue-in-cheek, but most people understand where it's coming from and enjoy the art...

I spend my days as a C programmer on Solaris, but I've been using Linux for 8 years and Ubuntu since Warty.
