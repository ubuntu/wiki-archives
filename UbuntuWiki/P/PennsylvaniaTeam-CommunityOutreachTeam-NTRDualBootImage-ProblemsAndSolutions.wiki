__TOC__

NTR has several different imaging related issues with the PCs they have in stock, brought to them by customers, or brought to them during the "Bring a Computer Ask a Question Workshops".  Here are some arguments against the dual drive/boot system we've started with:
* Some of the desktop PCs are small.  They can only accommodate a single 3.5" hard drive.
* Most laptops can only take a single hard drive.
* NTR may run out of 3.5" hard drives for use on the dual drive/boot systems.

Presently, we have 3 solutions for imaging drives.  Each one has its own strengths and weaknesses.  It may be necessary to use a combination of all 3 to satisfy NTR's needs.  Here is a brief description of each solution:
# Benchtop Imaging System
# Networked Imaging Server
# Kanguru Disk Cloning System
