=== About Me ===

Hi. I'm ppaul ( Paul Piscuc ) . I'm an active supporter of the Linux community and philosophy, and an Ubuntu user since Ubuntu Dapper. After using Ubuntu for various production servers and desktop computers, I have decided to give something back, and help as much as I can the development and internationalization process of Ubuntu.

I have experience with the following programming languages:
* Python
* Perl
* C
