* ''Please do not edit''
* Freezes normally happen around 2100 UTC time of the given date.  This permits those last changes to be incorporated into the nightly builds.  Last minute changes need to happen before then unless otherwise indicated by release manager.
* Some background information and Q&A about the Ubuntu release process can be found on TimeBasedReleases
