__TOC__

I'm currently doing bug management for the Inkscape project.

I'm autistic (Asperger Syndrome), which has all kinds of advantages in bug management.  Unfortunately, it also means I'm not always good at communicating with people.  For instance, I try my best not to be rude, but I often forget to wrap my comments or questions in the pleasantries that some people seem to expect.  If you are offended by anything I write, please clue me in on it!
