=== Why Ubuntu for me ===
I have over the years been using different OS's, but actually when building my present system, I decided that it was time to try some of the Linux distributions. My choice became Ubuntu 7.10 64 bit. I was pretty surprised how easy the installation went, despite the fact I'm using raid 1.

Since then I have been searching and listening on good advices.

I find that I have got some nice grip on Ubuntu though not yet expert. There is still room for improvements.

=== My efforts towards Ubuntu Community ===
   
** I support resolving issues on <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntudanmark.dk/forum]]</nowiki>.

** Since June 2008 I have attended to the extent possible at Danish Loco meetings.

** Testing upcoming new versions of Ubuntu and filing bug reports.

** Having started to do translation on some part of Xfce.

==== Outlook for future ====

It is hard for one to say what future will bring you.

*** I will be trying to start a translation team for translation of Xfce into Danish.
*** Becoming more collaborative towards the community within my abilities.

==== Taking part in ====

*** Cofounder of Xfce Translation Team into Danish.
*** Former Boardmember of association <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DanishTeam/Forening |'Foreningen af danske Ubuntubrugere']]</nowiki>. {{http://www.imageviper.com/displayimage/127692/0/ubuntu-dk-big-40x40.png}}
