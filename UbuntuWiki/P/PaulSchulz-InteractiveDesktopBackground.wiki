=== Interactive Desktop Background ===

It would be useful (and fun) to have an interactive desktop, based around a scripting language (like lisp and/or xml) which allows the background to be manipulated by the user for drawing, keeping notes, launching other applications etc.

This desktop would form a similar role for the desktop and editing 'drawings', that emacs currently holds for editing files.

It is to be designed to be easily extensible and configurable.

==== A Solution ====

A liked that background a lot and decided to make a package which automatically installs that. Maybe one can be made for Ubuntu itself
