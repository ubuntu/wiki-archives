=== About Me ===

==== Description ====
 
I am a college student majoring in Mathematics with a minor in software development. I use Ubuntu on a daily basis and have taken an interest in joining the open source community. I want to help make Ubuntu available for more people any way I can. Currently I am new member of the bug squad and looking forward to helping as much as I can. Eventually I would like to help fix and develop software for Ubuntu but my programming skills are not there yet.
