__TOC__

(from ogra's http://paste.ubuntu.com/10501535/)

* get the IP of the device with ifconfig
* android-gadget-service enable ssh
* use phablet-shell once so your ssh key gets copied in place
* log out from phablet-shell or adb
* scp the android-tools-adbd package in place
* ssh phablet@<ip of the phone> 
* sudo mount -o remount,rw /
* sudo dpkg -i /path/to/adbd.deb
* sudo mount -o remount,ro /
* sudo reboot

now check that:
* adb root is a nop-op
* adb shell only works with screen unlocked (adb on the PC should print "error: closed"
* adb push and pull only work with unlocked screen
* adb reboot and adb reboot-recovery work in any case (locked and unlocked screen)
