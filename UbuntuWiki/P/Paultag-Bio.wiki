== About Me ==

I'm Paul. I like GNU/Linux. A lot. I've been using since 2001, and I've without any sort of non-free operating system since 2005. I like programming a whole lot. I can't really dance well, but I can do a mean robot. I love music and can play a few instruments. Also skiing, I do that too.

Some ask me what I'm into. I think algorithmic efficiency, low overhead algorithms, distributed algorithms and swarm behavior are some of the coolest things ever. Embedded stuff rocks too. Boohyeah.
