Hi I am Pravin. I work as Embedded Linux Coder and Marketing Manager for Eurotech Inc, Ks. I love coding and technology marketing at same time. 
I have experience in Embedded software coding using C/Java/OSGi on linux/Real time linux platforms.

I am a big enthusiast of Open source projects and had been using ubuntu for a long time. I switched over to ubuntu from windows because of following reasons:
It actually works :)
It is relatively stable and
availability of code makes it even more interesting

I have joined the ubuntu marketing team. Quite new but always ready to contribute to ubuntu marketing and would be involved with ubuntu marketing team in future. I work in USA but would love to get involved with marketing ubuntu in educational domain in India. I think there is tremendous scope for ubuntu in educational arena.
