=== Test Plan ===

'''This test plan is not supposed to be complete; use it to guide your manual testing so they dont miss big functional areas that are part in the component; also this should be used as guideline to inspire the exploratory testing which should be adapted smartly based on the real content of a MP'''

=== Test Case: Creating a new HTML5 application ===
==== Procedure ====
* Open the Ubuntu SDK IDE (Qt Creator)
** Go File > New Project > Ubuntu > HTML5 App
* Name the new project and save in a directory
** The project should be created an opened, and the default index.html page displayed by defaut

=== Test Case: Running a new HTML5 application ===
==== Procedure ====
From a project created with the above procedure
* Go Build > Run without deployment
** Verify that the app launches on the desktop where the IDE is used

* Go Build > Ubuntu > Install Application on Device
** Verify that the app launches when launching it from the attached Ubuntu phone

=== Test Case: Use the HTML5 inspector to debug applications ===
==== Procedure ====
From a project created with the "Creating a new HTML5 application" procedure
* Add an "--inspector" argument to the Exec line of the desktop file if not already present,

* Go Build > Run without deployment
** Verify that the app launches on the desktop where the IDE is used
** Search for a line similar to "Inspector server started successfully. Try pointing a WebKit browser to http://192.168.0.101:9221" in the Application Output log of QtCreator,
** Browse with a WebKit based browser to the IP:Port stated above (chromium or google chrome will do),
** Make sure that you can inspect the page,

=== Test Case: Make sure that Ubuntu APIs are available to an application ===
==== Procedure ====
From a project created with the "Creating a new HTML5 application" procedure
* Replace the content of the "index.html" and "app.js" files found in the default
project by the ones found here http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~webapps/unity-webapps-qml/trunk/files/head:/examples/api-bindings/download-manager/www/,

* Go Build > Run without deployment
** Verify that the app launches on the desktop where the IDE is used
** Make sure that the application runs as expected and that you can interact with it properly, e.g. for the download manager example, make sure that you can download the two files shown (by clicking the 2 buttons),

=== Test Case: Make sure that Ubuntu Online Accounts APIs are working properly ===
==== Procedure ====
* bzr branch lp:ubuntu-sdk-tutorials
* cd ubuntu-sdk-tutorials/html5
* From there, in QtCreator, successively:
** Open the oa-1.ubuntuhtmlproject project in html5-example-online-accounts,
*** Make sure that you have a facebook account listed on the device,
*** Run on the device making sure that you can access your facebook account and its details,
** Open the oa-2.ubuntuhtmlproject project in html5-example-online-accounts-facebook-albums,
*** Make sure that you have a facebook account listed on the device,
*** Run on the device making sure that you can access your facebook account and if you have photos that you can see some of them,

=== Test Case: Make sure that Ubuntu Content Hub APIs are working properly ===
==== Procedure ====
From a project created with the "Creating a new HTML5 application" procedure
* Replace the content of the "index.html" and "app.js" files found in the default
project by the ones found here http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~webapps/unity-webapps-qml/trunk/files/head:/examples/api-bindings/content-peer-picker/www/,

* Go Build > Run without deployment
** Verify that the app launches on a device
** Press on the button at the top, and make sure that the Content picker UI appears over the HTML5 application and that you can interact with it,
