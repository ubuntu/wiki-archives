Tritium and I (gcleric) met with Sam from <nowiki>[[http://www.endorphinpower.org/|EPC]]</nowiki>.  A tentative plan has emerged to start our <nowiki>[[http://www.endorphinpower.org/|EPC]]</nowiki> support with their <nowiki>[[http://www.endorphinpower.org/library_computer_rm.jpg|computer lab]]</nowiki>.  Right now many of the computers are running windows 98 and XP.  Sam mentioned that most of the PCs are not usable because passwords have been lost or not shared. This is a critical point, when we setup this lab with Ubuntu we need to document and share everything we do with <nowiki>[[http://www.endorphinpower.org/|EPC]]</nowiki>.  In a broad stroke EPC would like us, with assistance from <nowiki>[[http://www.endorphinpower.org/|EPC]]</nowiki> residents, to install Ubuntu on all PC's in the lab and provide a little TLC to  the computers and the lab network. The computer lab does have internet access and a basic LAN, wired and wireless, but the wireless may need securing. Tritium and I where invited to attend the residents Community Council of the residents,  some expressed interest in learning about Ubuntu and would like to help us install/support lab's PC's.  At this point all volunteers who are interested in learning how to install Ubuntu, assisting with the installs, and helping EPC residents learn, install and support Ubuntu on their computer network are welcome.  <<BR>>

Sam asked when we thought we could start.  There was rough date of early Feb but I'm sure that we can discuss this and come up with a firm date and time during <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NewMexicoTeam/January,_17_2008|our next IRC meeting]]</nowiki>.

I think this is a great start for both the NM LoCo and <nowiki>[[http://www.endorphinpower.org/|EPC]]</nowiki>.  Once we can prove ourselves as an organization and as <nowiki>[[http://www.endorphinpower.org/|EPC]]</nowiki> becomes confident with us and with what Ubuntu has to offer I think this is the start of something great for EPC, the NM LoCo, the NM Community and Ubuntu Linux.  <<BR>>

Scheduling next meeting with Sam as of right now there appears to be a tentative date of Friday Jan 11th at 5:30pm at EPC.

'''12/5/07'''<<BR>>
Meeting with Sam from <nowiki>[[http://www.endorphinpower.org/|EPC]]</nowiki>, and Eric and David from the New Mexico Ubuntu Loco. This meeting was the initial meeting setting up some exceptions and needs for both organizations. Out of this meeting came a greater understanding of what <nowiki>[[http://www.endorphinpower.org/|EPC]]</nowiki> does, and for EPC let them know what the New Mexico LoCo is all about. In the future the Loco will be setting up a campus network that will include a computer lab, office computers, and dorm room computers, all tied into a centralized network. Sam (the director of <nowiki>[[http://www.endorphinpower.org/|EPC]]</nowiki>) will be gone till January and this should give the New Mexico LoCo ample time to better organize our support structure.

Sam Slishman from EPC has picked up the PC's.  Final total was 23 PC's, 1 Dell PowerEdge 4400, and 2 3Com 10/100 Sweitches.  Talking with Sam to see how the Ubuntu NM LoCo can help.  Here's and email from Sam...

Wow Eric,

I feel like we've just walked into another realm of possibilities.
We have a number of interest groups at EPC and I'd like to see one start up that is focused on the IT topics that you all seem to love.

Initially the focus could be on setting up the network, but eventually maybe it could evolve into computing/resume writing/finance classes for future residents. Plenty of other ideas too.
Perhaps you and your Ubuntu Loco friends might like to have a meeting at the building some time at your convenience? I'll cc a few more folks who I think might also like to participate.

Thanks again so much Eric.

I'm looking forward to learning a lot here as well.

Sam

Sam from EPC is out of the country to middle of this week.  Discussed
getting help on setting up PCs and support for them once we get things
rolling.  There seemed to be alot of interest and offers to help out.  I
also mentioned that Charter Bank is getting on to a 6 month plan.  every
6 months we will be evaluating what we have in inventory are donating as
much as we can to 501c's.  This will not be limited to PC's but
switches, servers, racks, etc.  As of right now I have 23 PC's (13
gx240's and 10 GX110's) that are ready to have Xorg reconfigured for the
monitor attached to it.  After testing there are only 10 good monitors
so we have some extra PC's in the even that one dies or we could turn a
few into servers.  So for now I'm waiting for Sam to get back into town
to arrange pickup and further discuss SLA (service Level Agreement).

'''11/6/07''' <<BR>>
All PC's have been imaged and are ready for pickup EPC has been notified and are coordinating a time. Again A HUGE thanks to New Mexico Ubuntu LoCo Team Member <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/GrammatonCleric|Eric Krieger]]</nowiki> for all his hard work on this project.
