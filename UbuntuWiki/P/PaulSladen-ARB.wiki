=== Vision ===
Users benefit from the ready and fast availability of third-party applications and the ARB and developer programme are our opportunity to facility improvements in our Ubuntu users' lives and daily workflows.

For example, it might take many years for a sufficiently free application for French-speaking dentists' assistants to make it into the Debian or Ubuntu archives, and then into the following release.  Whereas,  a third-party developer may be better placed to independently support and provide such an application suite to such users by working in close collaboration with the receiving Ubuntu audience, and remaining responsive to the need for updates and feature improvements.

Within Ubuntu the developr programme is our opportunity to scale up the breathe of the computing experience for Ubuntu users exponentially, beyond what is available in a web-browser.  This is the opportunity for welcoming, reviewing and accepting un-thought-of new additions to the Ubuntu spirit and eco-system.

I do not anticipate being able to assist with reviewing every new developers' applications' application submitted, but I hope that I can provide input, particularly in the area of integration with the Ubuntu Desktop in terms of branding, integration with Unity, and alignment to the the Ayatana-designer's intents for well-designed extensions to the core Ubuntu experience.  A design that fits snugly within the whole, is likely to be more intuitive to use and increases the changes of getting more exposure.  Greater exposure benefits Ubuntu users (both you and I) and also benefits the applications developers uploading their products.

Lets make use of the amazing APT/dpkg technology that's been available to Debian-based operating system for 15 years, lets harness it and see just how quickly we can take it to the next plateau with better staffed pipeline.
