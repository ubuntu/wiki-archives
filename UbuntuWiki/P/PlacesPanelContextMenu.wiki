=== Summary ===
The »Places« panel in Nautilus should provide a context menu showing the same stuff as if it would be a starter on the desktop (needs to be cut down a bit for sure). It should at least show (CD drive example): Open; Open in new Window; Cut; Copy; Copy CD/DVD; Attributes and Unmount. You should also see this in coherence with the specification for easier volume managment, which would mean a few more items in the menu.

=== Comments ===

* 4 aug 2008 [Jens]: KDE 4.1 has nice places menu that displays an icon indicating weather the device is mounted or not. To the right there is an eject button. It's quite useful, and is easier to discover than a context menu.
