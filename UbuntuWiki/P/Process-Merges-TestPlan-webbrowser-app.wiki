=== Test Plan ===

'''This test plan is not supposed to be complete; use it to guide your manual testing so they dont miss big functional areas that are part in the component; also this should be used as guideline to inspire the exploratory testing which should be adapted smartly based on the real content of a MP'''

* Install latest (devel-proposed) image on phone
* Install freshly build MPs that are needed for landing
* Ensure that all AP tests (webbrowser_app and webapp_container suites) pass on the device

==== Browser ====
* Test browsing different sites by entering a url in the url bar
* Browse to a site, and while the page is loading, focus the address bar and start typing in it. Verify that when the current page is done loading, focus is not removed from the address bar, nor is the text reset (<nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/bugs/1373918|bug #1373918]]</nowiki>).
* Test navigation by clicking links in a webpage
* Test create and navigating between tabs
* Test that history is being updated on the activity page
* Test navigating to a page from history (verify that it is opened in a new tab)
* In the history view, long press on an entry and verify that this enters multi-selection mode
* In the history view, verify that swiping an entry to the right allows deleting it
* In the extended history view (all entries for one given domain), verify that swiping an entry to the right allows deleting it
* Test that auto suggestion popup appears correctly when typing in url bar
* Test that you can properly scroll on a web page by flicking
* Test pinch and zoom
* Press and hold on an image and ensure you can download it to the gallery
* Test that a page can be scrolled all the way up/down when in both orientations (portrait and landscape)
* Double click/tap on the drawer menu button in the chrome (right of the address bar) and ensure that it doesn’t open two instances of the drawer menu (if it did, one would have to tap twice outside of it to dismiss it)
* Browse to youtube.com and verify that you can play a video; leave it playing and ensure that the screen doesn’t dim after a minute of inactivity while the video is playing, then pause it and ensure that the screen eventually dims.
* Browse to https://www.browserleaks.com/geo and verify that you’re prompted permission to access location, accept, and verify that eventually the page manages to locate you accurately (ensure that GPS is turned on)
* Browse to http://www.wufoo.com/html5/attributes/07-accept.html, press the "choose file" button, and verify that the content hub offers the gallery-app as a provider, but not the address book
* Install the <nowiki>[[https://uappexplorer.com/app/com.ubuntu.docviewer|Document Viewer]]</nowiki> application from the store, then open a PDF document from a hyperlink in the browser (e.g. search for "example pdf" in google), verify that you get a prompt to either select an application that can handle this type of document or download in-app, and that Document Viewer is listed in the applications able to handle it, select it and when the download completes choose to open the document, and verify that it’s correctly open and can be read
* Clear the cookies DB (rm ~/.local/share/webbrowser-app/cookies.sqlite), browse to http://jasny.github.io/jquery.smartbanner/, and verify that no "smart banner" advertising a native android youtube app shows up at the top of the page
* Browse to https://mobile.twitter.com/session/new and verify that the login screen doesn’t display a prompt to install the android application
* Open a number of tabs (at least 4 or 5) and verify that in the "open tabs" view, captures are displayed for all tabs, not just the first two. Also verify that after exiting and relaunching the browser, the captures are still displayed for all tabs, even though they haven’t been loaded yet.
* Top sites: open a new tab, and verify that the new tab view has a "Top Sites" section. Long-press (or right-click) one of the top sites and delete it (this blacklists it so that it will not appear in the top sites any longer). Verify that after browsing to that site again, and opening a new tab, it doesn’t appear in the top sites section again.

* Secure connection feedback:
** browse to https://youtube.com , verify that the secure connection icon is displayed, tap on it to display the certificate details
** browse to https://expired.badssl.com/ , verify that you get a warning page that says that the security certificate has expired with an option to proceed anyway and an option to go back to safety
** choose to go back to safety, and verify that the page that was previously loaded is loaded again
** browse to https://expired.badssl.com/ again, verify that you get the same warning page again, choose to proceed anyway, verify that the page loads
** verify that there is a red broken padlock icon in the address bar (and that clicking it displays a popup that says that the server certificate has expired)
** browse to https://expired.badssl.com/ again, verify that you don’t get the warning page again
** browse to https://expired.badssl.com/ in a new tab, verify that you don’t get the warning page again
** browse to https://wrong.host.badssl.com/ , verify that you get a warning page that says that the security certificate does not match the identity of the site
** browse to https://mixed.badssl.com/ , verify that you get a padlock icon in the address bar together with a warning sign icon, verify that tapping on it displays a popover that says that the site has insecure content
** browse to https://revoked.grc.com , verify that you get a warning page that says that the security certificate has been revoked with no options (neither "go back to safety" nor "proceed anyway")
** browse to https://revoked.grc.com , wait for the warning page to be displayed, then focus the address bar, enter any valid URL (e.g. http://example.org) and validate, verify that the warning page goes away
** browse to a page that has a valid favicon (e.g. http://start.ubuntu.com), then browse to https://revoked.grc.com and verify that when the warning page is shown, the favicon from the previous page is not displayed any longer

* 7 digital album downloads (if you don't have any albums you'll need to purchase one first, or ask the QA team for the credentials of the test account, which has at least one purchased album):
** Visit https://m.7digital.com, login and click "Your Music".
** Choose an album and click the button to download a zip file.
** Select the Music app.
** When the download completes open the music app and verify that the new album has been added.

* Test multi-window functionality
** Open a new window and ensure that it allows navigating to urls and that they are added to history and suggestions
** Open a private window and ensure that when navigating to urls they are not added to the history or suggestions in the public window
