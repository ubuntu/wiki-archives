[07:00] <dholbach> hello everybody!
[07:00] <dholbach> who do we have here for the Q&A session?
[07:00] <dholbach> maybe let's start with a quick round of introductions
=== ChanServ changed the topic of #ubuntu-classroom to: Welcome to the Ubuntu Classroom - http://wiki.ubuntu.com/Classroom || Support in #ubuntu || Upcoming Schedule: http://is.gd/8rtIi || Event: Packaging Training Session - Current Session: Packaging and MOTU Q&A - Instructor: dholbach || Questions in #ubuntu-classroom-chat
[07:01]  * dholbach is Daniel Holbach, living in Berlin, interested in making Ubuntu Development more exciting :)
[07:01] <dholbach> who else do we have here?
[07:01] <gotunandan> i am here
[07:01] <dholbach> sorry
[07:01] <dholbach> just turned the moderation off
[07:02] <dholbach> so please speak up, when you're here and let's do some introductions :)
[07:02] <gotunandan> nobody else ?
[07:02] <gotunandan> i saw your dent on identi.ca and popped up here !
[07:02] <dholbach> nice gotunandan :)
[07:03] <dholbach> I'm sure we have a few shy lurkers among the 154 people in here :)
[07:03] <jk-> ok, Jeremy Kerr here, living in Perth, Australia
[07:03] <gotunandan> still need to use #ubuntu-classroom-chat for the questions ?
[07:03] <jk-> :)
[07:03] <dholbach> hey jk-
[07:03] <jk-> heya dholbach
[07:03] <dholbach> no no, we'll just chat in here
[07:04] <dholbach> are you excited about maverick? :)
[07:04] <jk-> i am in a constant state of excitement
[07:04] <gotunandan> yeap... and more keen on joining in the "fun" in some way
[07:05] <dholbach> awesome - I set up a vm for maverick already :)
[07:05] <dholbach> did you guys bring any questions or is there anything you were wondering about packaging, ubuntu development, motu, tools, processes, etc?
[07:06] <jk-> kinda - I see that a package has been dropped (due to FTBFS), and would like to adopt it
[07:06] <jk-> so maybe that's more of a 'process' type issue
[07:06] <gotunandan> <QUESTION> What would I need to start with to help with packaging ? I have already done some basic packaging and I have a ppa on launchpad as gotunandan. But not sure whom to approach to get actively involved in helping the MOTU
[07:06] <maco> dholbach: better a vm than your actual system O_O toolchain freeze scary
[07:07] <dholbach> ok, let's go through these one by one
[07:07] <dholbach> jk-: cool - which package is it?
[07:07] <jk-> python-creoleparser
[07:07] <dholbach> maco: definitely - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopment/UsingDevelopmentReleases is your friend :)
[07:08] <dholbach> jk-: I found it here: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/creoleparser/0.6.1-1
[07:09] <dholbach> and it seems to have built on i386: packages that are architecture-independent, such as a bunch of python scripts are just built on i386
[07:09] <maco> gotunandan: have you seen harvest http://daniel.holba.ch/harvest ? its dholbach's "find low hanging fruit for motu-wannabes" site
[07:10] <dholbach> maco: this one is not functional right now - I hope to get the new harvest site up soon though
[07:10] <gotunandan> maco: I have heard of it, not seen it. Having a look
[07:10] <jk-> dholbach: but not built for lucid?
[07:10] <maco> dholbach: oh
[07:10] <dholbach> Usually the https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/creoleparser/+publishinghistory page shows if it was removed or something
[07:10] <maco> dholbach: what happened to the prettiness rockstar made last UDS? it never got uploaded?
[07:10] <dholbach> jk-: it was built in karmic, then it never changed afterwards
[07:11]  * maco tries to remember +publishinghistory
[07:11] <jk-> i see
[07:11] <dholbach> maco: it was improved, but it's not deployed yet
[07:11] <dholbach> jk-: we don't rebuild all packages for a new release - it'd probably take weeks :)
[07:12] <dholbach> we just "copy them over"
[07:12] <dholbach> jk-: is there anything wrong with the package right now?
[07:12] <jk-> ok
[07:12]  * jk- wonders why it's not appearing in the repo then
[07:12] <dholbach> ok, let's see about that
[07:12] <jk-> possibly quite off-topic now though :)
[07:12] <dholbach> no no, that's fine
[07:13] <dholbach> first of all: you're right :)
[07:13] <persia> It's a bit off-topic, but the binary was probably removed due to a FTBFS with current tools, as a result of a supportable-binaries spec in lucid.  This affected ~600 packages.
[07:13] <dholbach> daniel@miyazaki:~$ LC_ALL=C sudo apt-get install -s python-creoleparser
[07:13] <dholbach> Reading package lists... Done
[07:13] <dholbach> Building dependency tree
[07:13] <dholbach> Reading state information... Done
[07:13] <dholbach> elky: Couldn't find package python-creoleparser
[07:13] <dholbach> daniel@miyazaki:~$
[07:13] <dholbach> oh, that's interesting, let me test-build it
[07:13] <persia> dholbach: Fix your nick-completion :)
[07:13]  * elky tilts her head wondering...
[07:14] <dholbach> errrrrr, that was xchat-gnome-auto-completion
[07:14] <dholbach> sorry about that - I didn't even press "tab" :)
[07:14] <dholbach> I just copied/pasted
[07:14] <elky> That's  not a very nice feature then
[07:14] <dholbach> not, not really
[07:14] <ToyKeeper> xchat -> settings -> preferences -> input box -> [ ] Automatic nick completion (without tab key)
[07:15] <persia> It's more helpful than it ought be: file a bug :)
[07:15] <dholbach> ok, so I just  apt-get source creoleparser; sudo pbuilder build creoleparser*.dsc
[07:15]  * elky hugs regular xchat and goes back to what she was doing.
[07:16] <gotunandan> maco: yes seen it now. Cannot really fathom where to go though ?
[07:16] <dholbach> aha, the package fails to build: http://paste.ubuntu.com/428772/
[07:16] <maco> gotunandan: dholbach just said that its currently in ick mode. the shiny new harvest isnt online yet apparently
[07:16] <gotunandan> maco: the sourcepackages,html page is huge !
[07:17] <maco> yeah.... i remember that
[07:17] <dholbach> gotunandan: best to ignore that page for now, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MOTU/TODO lists a bunch of pages that make more sense right now
[07:17] <dholbach> jk-: I just had a look if the package changed in Debian and it did - http://packages.debian.org/changelogs/pool/main/c/creoleparser/creoleparser_0.7.1-1/changelog looks a lot like it's going to build now
[07:17] <jk-> dholbach: so, say I hack on it a bit and fix that;
[07:17] <dholbach> "   * Use python.mk for install options."
[07:17] <ToyKeeper> (if xchat-gnome doesn't have the UI, it's probably '/set completion_auto off')
[07:18] <maco> gotunandan: also, if you can read a bit of code, know how to apply a patch & rebuild a package... the patch review team could use some help ;-)
[07:18] <dholbach> I'll just get the source from Debian and see if that works
[07:18] <dholbach> (got to the changelog page via packages.debian.org/src:<source package>)
[07:18] <maco> gotunandan: the patch review team and motu both have the goal of getting the patch in & bug fixed. its just that the patch review team tries to get the patches to upstream or debian so then the motu can just update the package to the latest version upstream and it magically is fixed
[07:19] <gotunandan> maco: yes, thats certainly possible. Whom do I get in touch with, nigelbabu ?
[07:19] <jk-> dholbach: sid ?
[07:19] <dholbach> jk-: if the package from debian builds just fine, we'll auto-import it in a few days (once maverick is truly open) since the package is unmodified in Ubuntu
[07:19] <dholbach> jk-: http://packages.debian.org/search?searchon=sourcenames&keywords=creoleparser
[07:19] <maco> gotunandan: sure or join #ubuntu-reviews
[07:19] <jk-> ok
[07:19] <maco> gotunandan: we've got a patch day going right now
[07:19] <persia> gotunandan: If you're looking for patch review, stop by #ubuntu-reviews : if you're looking at getting the patch straight into Ubuntu, #ubuntu-motu is the better place.
[07:20] <jk-> but we sync from sid or squeeze?
[07:20] <maco> persia: well once its reviewed it can still have a shot at an sru
[07:20] <dholbach> jk-: ah, sorry - I misunderstood - I think for maverick we'll sync from sid again
[07:20] <jk-> i guess it doesn't matter in this case :)
[07:20] <dholbach> yep, but it fails the same way
[07:21] <dholbach> http://paste.ubuntu.com/428774/
[07:21] <jk-> so I should hack on the debian package instead?
[07:21] <dholbach> it'll get auto-imported, so it will make sense to work on that
[07:22] <dholbach> what I'd probably try next is to see if a bug was already filed upstream about this
[07:22] <dholbach> it's a bit weird that the package seems to build in debian, but not here
[07:22] <dholbach> since we don't modify its code
[07:23] <dholbach> jk-: if the fix is really just "add some __init__.py files", it'd probably make sense to fix it in lucid too if the package is truly helpful
[07:24] <persia> Actually, arch:all packages often run into this issue, because of differences in the Debian and Ubuntu build systems.
[07:24] <dholbach> gotunandan: to get back to your question: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MOTU/TODO lists a lot of useful stuff - once maverick opens I guess a lot of people will focus on merging packages from Debian
[07:24] <persia> Most of those are bugs that are happily fixed in Debian.
[07:24] <dholbach> persia: but you wouldn't know what specifically is broken there? it's not a common ftbfs?
[07:25] <persia> I don't happen to know, sorry.
[07:25] <dholbach> ok, thanks
[07:25] <dholbach> gotunandan: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopment/Merging should give you some tips how to do it
[07:25] <dholbach> (and of course there's always #ubuntu-packaging and #ubuntu-motu)
[07:25] <persia> http://qa.ubuntuwire.com/uehs/no_updated.html is also worth mentioning in the context of merging: we don't get everything from Debian.
[07:25] <gotunandan> dholbach: thanks !
[07:25] <jk-> ok, say it's an ubuntu-specific fix then, and I create a dpatch, what next?
[07:26] <dholbach> get it sponsored: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SponsorshipProcess
[07:26] <jk-> ok, cool
[07:26] <dholbach> usually just file a bug report or use an existing one, add the patch, subscribe ubuntu-sponsors, get it uploaded
[07:27] <maco> dpatch?
[07:27] <dholbach> or you can use the distributed development approach
[07:27] <dholbach> where you branch off of lp:ubuntu/creoleparser
[07:27] <maco> is dpatch like debdiff? ive not heard this one before...
[07:27] <jk-> so attach the dpatch itself, or a patch to add the dpatch + changelog + etc
[07:27] <dholbach> maco: dpatch is one of the many patch systems
[07:27] <jk-> ?
[07:27] <persia> maco: dpatch is one of hte available patch systems: `apt-cache show dpatch`
[07:27] <dholbach> jk-: the latter makes it more straight-forward to just upload it (if it's good)
[07:28] <jk-> ok, great
[07:28] <maco> jk-: for what dholbach just mentioned with distributed development: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DistributedDevelopment/Documentation
[07:28] <jk-> maco: thanks
[07:28] <dholbach> where you branch off of lp:ubuntu/creoleparser , create a branch for that fix, and add a merge proposal
[07:28] <maco> im starting to appreciate source version 3 uniting on quilt. at least i only have to know how one thing works
[07:29] <dholbach> mvo wrote a tool call edit-patch (in ubuntu-dev-tools), it should help with all the different patch systems
[07:29] <maco> dholbach: hey i have a motu sponsory question. is there a way to see all bugs that have branches attached?
[07:29] <maco> or to see all open merge proposals for which you are able to approve it?
[07:29] <dholbach> maco: I use http://qa.ubuntu.com/reports/sponsoring/index.html
[07:29] <dholbach> and sort by the first column
[07:29] <dholbach> all "unseeded"
[07:30] <maco> dholbach: i thought that was just listing bugs that have sponsors subscribed
[07:30] <dholbach> erm
[07:30] <dholbach> that's broken
[07:30] <dholbach> maco: no, branches too
[07:30] <dholbach> but the "unseeded" thing is broken right now
[07:30] <dholbach> more TODO list
[07:30] <dholbach> I'll get to it later today
[07:30] <maco> it just looks like all but 2 are for unseeded packages
[07:31] <jk-> does the merge proposal need a corresponding bug?
[07:31] <dholbach> maco: yes, that's a bug
[07:31] <maco> jk-: generally, yeah
[07:31] <dholbach> no
[07:31] <dholbach> if there's a bug, link to it, but you don't need to specifically file onw
[07:31] <dholbach> one
[07:31] <maco> i thought for bookkeeping it was good to have a bug and a LP: #foo in the changelog?
[07:31] <jk-> ok
[07:32] <maco> is this a bzr-lets-bookkeeping-happen-regardless thing?
[07:32] <dholbach> if there's some actual discussion about the thing going on, it's good to link to it in the changelog
[07:32] <dholbach> but if you just say something like "changed x, y and z in a, b, c: this makes the package build again" that's totally fine
[07:32] <persia> If there is a bug, the bug in the changelog is good.  For a Debian merge or UEHS update, no point to a bug if it doesn't already exist and one is pushing a branch.
[07:33] <dholbach> you'd write the same in the bug report anyway
[07:34] <maco> persia: k so the tendency i had to only file a bug once i had a patch ready to hand to a sponsor... that would no longer require filing a bug?
[07:34] <dholbach> not if you use distributed development
[07:34] <persia> maco: You may either file a bug or push a branch and request a merge.  Both show up on the sponsoring report.
[07:34] <dholbach> but still document as good as you can :)
[07:34] <maco> neat
[07:34] <dholbach> when you use bzr and distributed development, you can easily do a   bzr commit --fixes lp:123456   to link it
[07:35] <maco> though rawr ive only been at this a year-ish and im already behind the times
[07:35] <dholbach> (if this bug exists)
[07:35]  * persia tends to put the bugs in the changelog, and then use debcommit to automate the --fixes bit
[07:35] <dholbach> maco: I think everybody's figuring out how best to make use of UDD (ubuntu distributed development) right now
[07:35]  * maco does like persia
[07:35] <dholbach> persia: yes, that works as well :)
[07:35] <jk-> dholbach, persia, maco: awesome, thanks for the info, i owe you guys a beer :)
[07:35] <dholbach> (I've been working a lot on non-distro things in the last few weeks :-))
[07:36] <dholbach> jk-: no worries
[07:36] <persia> If it's not clear to anyone: there are almost no "right answers", as long as you find something that 1) works for you, and 2) complies with policy, and 3) happens to match others workflows.
[07:36] <maco> persia: you know whats fun (not really)? this mess:  bzr-buildpackage -S -- -sa -v####
[07:36] <dholbach> as you can see it was very useful to talk about these questions :)
[07:36] <dholbach> maco: I'd move the "-S" behind the "--"
[07:37] <dholbach> bzr bd -- -S -sa -v<version>
[07:37] <persia> Why -sa?
[07:37] <maco> persia: i was merging fromd debian
[07:37]  * persia actively avoids using -sa *except* when cleaning up after other folks
[07:37] <dholbach> persia: if you need to upload a new upstream tarball?
[07:37] <maco> where there was a new upstream release
[07:37] <persia> Still shouldn't need -sa
[07:37] <maco> well buildpackage was Not Happy when i didnt use it
[07:37] <maco> though that couldve been because i forgot -v too
[07:37] <persia> dholbach: It will auto-include it if it thinks it's warranted.
[07:38] <dholbach> persia: if you have 1.2-1ubuntu1 in Ubuntu and merge 2.4-5 from Debian?
[07:38] <dholbach> oh nice
[07:38] <maco> i was flailing about today trying to remember how to merge
[07:38] <persia> RIght, that's clearly a new upstream, so you get a new tarball.
[07:38] <dholbach> persia: and it includes the -sa magically?
[07:38] <maco> persia: so my forgetting -v is why it wanted me to -sa?
[07:38] <persia> It only fails when the versions aren't sufficiently different, or you need to push a new tarball to clean up after some mess.
[07:38] <dholbach> maco: the two are unrelated
[07:38] <maco> hrmph
[07:38] <persia> maco: Yes, because you didn't scope it correctly.
[07:38] <dholbach> gotcha
[07:39] <dholbach> do you all have any more questions? anything that was unclear in the explanations right now?
[07:39]  * maco looks back and forth from persia to dholbach
[07:39] <persia> dholbach: If the upload version and the prior version have different upsteam versions, yep.
[07:39]  * maco wishes you'd agree a bit
[07:39] <dholbach> maybe somebody of the shy people (not jk- and gotunandan :-)) who are just lurking here?
[07:39] <dholbach> persia: great
[07:39] <dholbach> maco: I filed bug 576242
[07:39] <ubottu> Launchpad bug 576242 in ubuntu-sponsoring "Everything is "unseeded"" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/576242
[07:39] <persia> maco: It is the dynamic cooperative disagreement that is central to the process of arriving towards a flexible set of working practices :)
[07:40] <maco> dholbach: it *is* possible that one of those very rare times when the main sponsors are more efficient than the universe sponsors happened
[07:40] <maco> (yes i know old names)
[07:40] <dholbach> maco: no, I think it's more a problem with the packagesets in maverick
[07:40] <persia> It's a bug.
[07:41] <dholbach> any more questions? anything else you wondered about? anything else that seems broken? :)
[07:42] <maco> how many uploads do you have to sponsor before you get a pony?
[07:42] <maco> </jorge>
[07:43] <dholbach> I don't know, but you get a lot of people liking you for reviewing their stuff :)
[07:46] <dholbach> any more questions?
[07:46] <ajmitch> how do we be a rock star? :)
[07:47] <dholbach> ajmitch: you of all should know!
[07:47] <arand_> (Don't have a system in fron of me, so general question): I find that I struggle quite a bit when i try to update a package with new [insert scm] versions. If I don't have an orig.tar.gz, is there any general guidelines on how to get to the point where ther is one, whilst still reusing the old diff.gz (possible?)
[07:47] <maco> scm?
[07:47] <ajmitch> source control
[07:47] <arand_> git/svn/whathaveyou
[07:48] <maco> pristine-tar?
[07:48] <ajmitch> generally there'll be ways of exporting it, such as 'svn export', or possibly 'make dist' for an automake project
[07:49] <ajmitch> whatevr way suits the project best, you'll want to have a get-orig-source target in debian/rules so that it can be automated by others
[07:49] <dholbach> ./configure <---> && make dist    (if available) should give you a tarball
[07:49] <dholbach> and something like   svn export   should make sure you don't have revision control meta data in your tarball
[07:50] <dholbach> I hope that one fine day in the future we stop caring about tarballs and just use branches for everything :)
[07:50] <maco> what does "bzr-buildpackage --split" do?
[07:50] <dholbach> until then, the above will make sense :)
[07:50] <maco> it says Automatically create an .orig.tar.gz from a full source branch.
[07:50] <maco> dholbach:  does that do what arand_ is asking for?
[07:50] <ClassBot> There are are 10 minutes remaining in the current session.
[07:50] <arand_> The autogen.sh I've seen around (with no configure), should one just run that and then "make dist" In those cases?
[07:51] <persia> arand_: All those alternatives aside, you should encourage any upsteam to produce some release archive (.tgz, .tar.bz2, .zip, whatever) when they do a release.
[07:51] <dholbach> arand_: that sounds like a good bet
[07:51] <maco> arand_: autogen.sh, in my experience, generates the configure
[07:51] <dholbach> maco: yes, that should work if they use bzr (or one has set up a launchpad import of some other revision control branch)
[07:52] <arand_> Does the autogen not also run the configure normally?
[07:52] <maco> dholbach: idea for next UOW:  UDD
[07:52] <ajmitch> yes please
[07:52] <dholbach> arand_: I've seen it do so, but I wouldn't rely on it
[07:52] <dholbach> arand_: best read what it does - they're usually quite small
[07:52] <dholbach> maco: james_w has been running them for every UDW and a few UOWs too
=== gotunandan_ is now known as gotunandan
[07:53] <dholbach> ajmitch: there should be heaps of logs :)
[07:53] <arand_> Anyway, it appears as though "make dist" was the link I was missing in general
[07:53] <arand_> Thanks
[07:53] <dholbach> glad that works :)
[07:53] <maco> dholbach: oh in that case i need to pay more attention :P
[07:53] <dholbach> maco: but yeah, I guess we need to raise the profile of UDD
[07:53] <dholbach> I just learned about   bzr lp-open   a few weeks back
[07:53] <ajmitch> dholbach: yeah, it'll be a matter of finding & reading, like much of the documentation around
[07:54] <ajmitch> a few weeks? I learnt about it today
[07:54] <dholbach> ajmitch: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDeveloperWeek/Previous
[07:54] <ajmitch> thanks
[07:54] <dholbach> de rien
[07:54] <maco> if the goal is for that to be the way things are done moving forward, seems it ought to be whats given to new contribs off the bat
[07:55] <imbrandon> bzr lp-open ?
[07:55] <dholbach> imbrandon: will open the launchpad page of the branch in a browser :)
[07:55] <persia> There's a sufficiency of folks that prefer the non-bzr method that we'll probably end up supporting both for a very long time.
[07:55] <dholbach> so if you want to submit a merge proposal, that makes it easy
[07:55] <persia> (especially for the die-hard git folk)
[07:55] <ClassBot> There are are 5 minutes remaining in the current session.
[07:56] <dholbach> ok, any more questions?
[07:58] <dholbach> ok... in that case best ask your questions in #ubuntu-packaging or #ubuntu-motu later on!
[07:58] <dholbach> have a great day everybody and thanks for all your questions and answers
[07:58] <dholbach> you guys rock!
[07:58] <ajmitch> thank you dholbach
[07:58] <arand_> Thanks for the session!
