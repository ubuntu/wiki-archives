== Emergency Calling Tests ==

'''Note''' - there currently isn't a good way to run the following tests without risking an actual call to the authorities. A few ideas have been discussed such as adding debug hooks to ofono that would allow a redirect to a non-emergency number, however the binary rild daemon may also do validation of emergency numbers in both of the cases below, the call will most likely not be completed.  The right place for such hooks is probably within rild itself.  Hopefully this can be explored with one more ODMs.

''Perform these tests at your own risk. If you accidentally allow a connection, don't hangup, please instead explain to the operator that the call was made by mistake.''

=== 1. Call to Emergency Number without SIM ===

==== Purpose ====
This test case verifies that we can call an Emergency Number without SIM card.

==== Requirements: ====
We must remove the SIM from the phone.

==== Steps: ====

* list-modems
  The EmergencyNumbers property from org.ofono.VoiceCallManager will show the detected emergency numbers. We will use one of them to make the call.
* dial-numer <ecc>
  We verify that a call can be established
* list-calls
  The property “Emergency” must be set to 1 for the call

=== 2. Call to Emergency Number with locked SIM ===

==== Purpose ====
This test case verifies that we can call an Emergency Number without unlocking the SIM card.

==== Requirements: ====
We must have a locked SIM in the phone, and do not unlock it after boot.

==== Steps: ====
* list-modems
  The EmergencyNumbers property from org.ofono.VoiceCallManager will show the detected emergency numbers. We will use one of them to make the call.
* dial-numer <ecc>
  We verify that a call can be established
* list-calls
  The property “Emergency” must be set to 1 for the call
