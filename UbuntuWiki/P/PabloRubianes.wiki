=== Testimonials ===

==== LoCo Council ====
He is a keymember of the Ubuntu community, with his smart, friendly and hard working. When I had the pleasure of meeting Rubianes, I was really impressed by his enthusiasm towards Ubuntu and the community. Since then, I've been in touch with him for LoCo things, and he's always been responsive and very active in anything he's been involved with. I fully support this application, and I think the Ubuntu Council should be proud to have members like him. '''<nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/costales|Costales]]</nowiki>'''

I know Pablo for more than 2 years. He really has a great talent and is an awesome guy to work in the projects. I have seen him being active in UBT and I know his LoCo activities and he really is impressive. I fully Endorse his application for the LoCo Council membership and he really will do the best. His activities listed above speaks for him along with me. :) -<nowiki>[[Mohan_chml]]</nowiki> (aka) Mohi 

Pablo has been an active member not only in Uruguay, but all around South America. While I was on the Ubuntu-BR Council, we were always exchanging experiences of what we were doing to promote Ubuntu and get our communities stronger. Considering the lack of leadership in South America, I am very happy to support him for the LoCo Council, as he knows our necessities and will be able to be a good representation for the South American Ubuntu Community  -<nowiki>[[dudanogueira]]</nowiki> Duda Nogueira

I testify... Pablo is one of the people who help develop Latin American communities and projects like ClassRoom_ES that promote integration between LoCo's. SergioMeneses Ubuntu-Colombia Council Member

I met Pablo about two years ago. He has always been well disposed, talented, intelligent, hardworking and cooperative. The work he has been carrying out in all the groups which he takes part in has always been outstanding. I believe that his participation in LoCo Team Council would be of great importance for the development and evolution of the Ubuntu Community.
I fully support his application. <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/unimix|Guillermo Lisi]]</nowiki>

Pablo is one of the most strong members of Ubuntu community around Latinamerica.  He has done great work not only for Uruguay but for latinamerica in general. He would be a really great asset in the Loco council.
'''<nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AndresMujica|Andres Mujica]]</nowiki>'''

==== Ubuntu Membership ====

I was Pablo's mentor in the Beginners Team membership process. This means I spent a lot of time with him and got to know him very well. I found him to be one of the nicest and most genuine people I had ever met. Someone who was guided by a strong Moral Compass. He was eager to learn, help other people, and embodies everything the Code of Conduct teaches us. Never frustrated and always positive I believe he embodies characteristics that we want in all Ubuntu Members. His work to provide opportunities in the community for Spanish speakers has always impressed me. Whenever he hears of an event or a something going on in the community he asks 'is there a Spanish version'. When the answer is no, too often it is, he quickly organizes a sister event in Spanish that in the end rivals the original in size and quality. I whole heartedly endorse Pablo Rubianes for Ubuntu Membership.

Hello I´m magu42, an enthusiast for free software,I know Pablo Rubianes from the last year, in www.ubuntu.org.uy and #ubuntu-uy, helping people all nights in the IRC, and posting in the community blog. Also I saw him organizing events about Ubuntu in the web, when he found events in English he make the same in Spanish, that is so useful in Latinamerica because not all people here speak English, for those things I think he must be an Ubuntu member, to continue helping us. '''<nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~emaga|magu42]]</nowiki>'''

Pablo Rubianes has been a great contributor to the Uruguay community, he is and active part of the organization of the community as he works on the web site, the IRC channel and the Community Council. He's also been involve in the organization of the Ubuntu Users Days spanish version, he is always willing to help and support free software, that's why I endose Pablo Rubianes for Ubuntu Membership. '''<nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/sofia%20vitale|Sofía Vitale]]</nowiki>'''

Pablo with other members had been a fundamental for the growing of our community in Uruguay. Without his active participation we weren't at the state we are and with the posibility of growing we have now. For the onces that we've been from the beginning of our LoCo is a pleasure to have members as actives as he, who is also doing admin of the web site. All in all he will be an excelent Ubuntu member as he has been an excelent Uruguay LoCo member. '''Julio D. Gianola'''
