=== Test Case: indicator-location/unity8-items-check ===
==== Procedure ====
* Login to a user session running Unity 8
* Pull down the top panel until it sticks open
* Navigate through the tabs until "Location" is shown
** Location is at the top of the menu
** The menu is populated with items

=== Test Case: indicator-location/phone-visibility ===
==== Procedure ====
* If the location indicator is visible, disable Location from its menu
** The Location indicator should disappear from the panel
* In ubuntu-system-settings's Security and Privacy/Location sheet, enable the GPS setting
** The Location indicator should be visible in the panel
* In the location indicator, check that the Location Settings... item is present
* In the location indicator, press the Location Settings item
** It should open the Security and Privacy settings, which includes the Location Settings. 
     Note: Security and Privacy settings is the closest path we can get by now, until we have 
     an entry for Location.
