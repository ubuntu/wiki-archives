=== Test Plan ===

'''NOTE:''' Please consider all platforms and configurations. "Ubuntu Phone" includes Nexus4, Nexus7 2013, arale, and krillin. "Ubuntu Desktop" can be tested by installing the <code>unity8-desktop-session</code> package. 

==== Ubuntu Phone ====

* Successful run of automated CI testing (already done by the CI autolander)
* In addition, install updated image on phone and tablet
* Install packages from build silo using citrain preferably

===== Sanity =====
** Boot and ensure Unity8 comes up, navigating/scrolling the ui/Dash works as expected (note: cross check known unity8 bugs for any oddities witnessed)
** Ensure the loading screen is seen on bootup, between the boot splash and the unity8 session.
** long power key press for power down dialog
** select "power off" and ensure device powers off
** select "restart" and ensure device restarts
** select "cancel" to close the dialog box

===== Screen Blanking =====
* For screen blanking testing, you may need to set up <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Touch/Testing/PhoneAndMessagingSimulation|PhoneSimSetup]]</nowiki> in case you don't have a sim card
* Ensure screen blanking & power down dialog works 
** '''time out''' screen goes off, default is 1 minute, will dim in 50 sec
** Ensure time out sits for 5 minutes as to allow deep sleep
** '''Power button unblanks screen'''
** '''Power button blanks screen'''
** Ensure interaction with the device resets timer to blank screen
** Open unity-system-settings application and change the timeout default, ensure blanking occurs at specified time (at the moment, it is "lock" but it is controlling the blankning, design working on 2nd setting as of Sept 2015)
** Ensure phone call or text message wakes up phone from screen off with proximity uncovered
** Ensure text message and alarm alerts if not touched, after unblanking screen, screen automatically goes off after 15 sec
** Cover proximity sensor, make call and send text to device, screen should remain off
** During incoming call alert and text make sure uncovering proximity sensor unblanks screen and subsequent recoverings/uncoverings of proximity sensor have no effect.
** During active phone call make sure uncovering proximity sensor unblanks screen and recovering proximity sensor blanks screen
** During incoming call alert and text message, with uncovered proximity sensor, ensure that screen interaction resets the timer to a user inactivity timer (set by unity-system-settings application, default 1 min)
** Ensure proximity sensor doesn't lock/crash the UI when stressed (bug 1359270 / 1359258)
** Call phone, don't answer, allow to dim, send text msg make sure screen lights up
** Send text, don't interact, allow to dim, make phone call make sure screen lights up
** '''not implemented yet''' Establish a phone call, hit power button to end call
