==== Who I Am ====

I am not employed by Canonical :O). The only thing I can say on my contributions to open source is that I'm an admin on the french wikipedia since 2005 (nickname Poleta33).

==== My Ubuntu Story ====

I've installed Ubuntu since Dapper. that's all !

==== Plans for the Future ====

Maybe contributing on others packages but not sure (I'm quite buzzy on the french wikipedia !).
