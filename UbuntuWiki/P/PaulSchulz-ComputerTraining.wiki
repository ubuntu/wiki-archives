Promoting Ubuntu Training in Australia

This page contains information/suggestions and resources for computer training using Ubuntu. Currently this is just a list of notes for myself. Eventually I would like to see this information merged into official Ubuntu training documentation (if there is anything useful here :-).

For introductory Ubuntu training in South Australia, see http://www.bettong.org.au.

If you know of any other organisations, please let me know - PaulSchulz

=== Possible Ubuntu Training Courses ===
(5 Apr 2006) The WEA (Worker's Education Association, Adult Education) of South Australia has just sent out their April-June Course guide, and I thought that I'd puruse the computer courses and see what was on offer.. while there was no Ubuntu or Linux training on offer there were the following computing courses. (Amounts are in AU$.)

Why did I bother typing this in? The list is a starting point for the sort of educational course that could be offered, and the prices that are charged.
