== Introduction ==
Grettings all, my names Primefalcon, I hve ben usin Ubuntu since 7.10 and am a long time regular on these forums amongst several others, I try to be as helpful as I can on both these forums as well along with others, offering both coding advice as well as general Linux help.

== About Me ==
I first got into Web page development around 2005, and started seriously coding in 2006 which exposed me to the world of Linux and I was instantly hooked to the open atmostphere of Linux.

These days I am either coding in php, html or whatnot or on The Ubuntu forums or another offering advice or commentary (forums can be as addictive as coding....)

I was born in Australia and mobed circa 2006 to America and married my wonderful wife.

== Contributions ==
I spend as much time as I have spare eithr helping on thse forums (or another) along with keeping an eye in https://answers.launchpad.net in case I an offer some helpful advice... I also promote Ubuntu as much as I can since I fully beleive in the direction Canonical and Ubuntu are headed!
