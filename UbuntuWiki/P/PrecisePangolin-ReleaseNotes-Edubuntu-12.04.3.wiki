== New Features in Edubuntu 12.04 LTS ==

Edubuntu is the Ubuntu flavour for education and children, it's based on Ubuntu and integrates additional software for use at home or in the classroom.

It's produced as a DVD image that can also be converted to an USB stick and includes support for most languages by default.

Edubuntu 12.04 LTS is the first 5 years, Long Term Support release of the Edubuntu project. This release will be supported until April 2017.

=== Edubuntu Applications ===

* Edubuntu now features <nowiki>[[http://www.epoptes.org/|Epoptes]]</nowiki>, a classroom administration tool that replaces iTalc. Epoptes is a Greek word that means "overseer", this tool allows you to watch, broadcast, lock and send messages to all the screens in a classroom.

* <nowiki>[[http://www.ltsp.org/|LTSP]]</nowiki> has been updated to the latest upstream version (5.3.x). Both LTSP live and the Edubuntu LTSP installer brings numerous bug fixes. The new LTSP should be faster, more stable and reduce your bandwidth consumption.

* Due to the Long Term Support commitment, Java is no longer included by default. As a result, <nowiki>[[http://www.geogebra.org/cms/|Geogebra]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page|Freemind]]</nowiki> aren't included by default either. However, both are available from the Ubuntu Software Centre under the usual non-LTS support terms.

* The KDE version of edubuntu-desktop will still be supported on a best effort basis but isn't covered by the LTS support term.

* By popular request and for the convenience of administrators, the full vim, as well as pastebinit are now installed by default.

* Edubuntu now ships with <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/download/ubuntu/windows-installer|Wubi]]</nowiki>, a tool that allows you to install Edubuntu from within Windows.

== Installation ==

=== Overview ===

Preparing your computer for Edubuntu is now much simpler, with a wider range of disk setup options. Each of these are detailed at length to provide you with a clear understanding of the actions that will take place with your selection.

You can now reinstall or upgrade an existing copy of Edubuntu with the DVD installer, provided that your computer is connected to the Internet. 

=== Download ===

Edubuntu 12.04.3 images can be downloaded from:
** http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/edubuntu/releases/12.04.3/release/ (official source)
** http://www.stgraber.org/download/releases/edubuntu/12.04.3/ (mirror)

=== System Requirements ===

The minimum memory requirement for Edubuntu 12.04 is 512 MB of memory but 1024 MB is highly recommended.
Note that some of your system's memory may be unavailable due to being used by the graphics card. If your computer has only the minimum amount of memory, the installation process will take longer than normal; however, it will complete successfully, and the system will perform adequately once installed.

It's recommended to use the i386 image for computers with less than 1GB of memory. For these systems, installing using the "Install Edubuntu" option from the DVD boot menu will also be faster as it'll save some memory (compared to the "Try Edubuntu without installing" option).

When using Edubuntu 12.04 as an LTSP server, you should plan at least an additional 256 MB per client.

The Edubuntu 12.04 installation image does not include support for old computers that do not support PAE. If your computer is affected, you can either first install Edubuntu 10.04 or 11.10 and upgrade to 12.04 or you can use the Lubuntu or Xubuntu images. The non-PAE version of the Linux kernel will be dropped completely following the 12.04 release.

== Upgrading ==

=== Upgrading from Edubuntu 11.10 ===

To upgrade from Edubuntu 11.10 on a desktop system, press Alt+F2 and type in "update-manager -d" (without the quotes) into the command box. Update Manager should open up and display following message: "New distribution release '12.04' is available. Click Upgrade and follow the on-screen instructions". 

=== Upgrading from Other Releases ===

Users of other Edubuntu releases need to upgrade first to 11.10, and then to 12.04.

For further information on upgrading to 11.10, please see the <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OneiricUpgrades| Ubuntu Oneiric upgrade instructions ]]</nowiki>.
