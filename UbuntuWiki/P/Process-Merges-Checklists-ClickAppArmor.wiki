__TOC__

Note: click-apparmor uses native versioning for its packaging (see X-Auto-Uploader, Vcs-Bzr and Vcs-Browser in debian/control) and therefore we don't autoincrement the version or autogenerate the changelog.

=== MP Submission Checklist ===
Note: Please ensure you include the following form filled out and submitted along side your code to the MP ticket.
* Is your branch in sync with latest trunk (e.g. bzr pull lp:click-apparmor -> no changes)
* is debian/changelog properly formatted in the MP (we use autobuilds with our own versioning, but not automerges at this time)?
** use next native version number (eg, 0.1.14, 0.1.15.3, 0.2, etc)
** make sure the distribution name is set to 'UNRELEASED'
** add your changelog entries
* Does your MP have a commit message? (commit message should consist of debian/changelog without the top line or committer (ie, just the changed text, not version, name or timestamp. This commit message should be ignored if you setup debian/changelog correctly, but it is best to have it be the same in case this changes)
* Did you build your software in a clean sbuild/pbuilder chroot or ppa?
* Did you build your software in a clean sbuild/pbuilder chroot or ppa on armhf? (need for testing later)
* Does the package's autopkgtests pass with exit status '0'? Eg:<pre>
$ adt-run -B ../binary/*.deb ../source/click-apparmor*dsc --- adt-virt-schroot trusty-amd64
</pre>
 Note: first build the package then point adt-run at the resulting binaries. Building the package with adt-run will fail because certain tests run if the user is root, but the root tests fail in the schroot since the schroot doesn't have /sys/kernel/security/apparmor present
* Has your component <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Process/Merges/TestPlans/ClickAppArmor|TestPlan]]</nowiki> been executed successfully on emulator/supported device?
* Has a 5 minute exploratory testing run been executed on emulator/supported device?
* If you changed the packaging (debian), did you subscribe a core-dev to this MP?
* What components might get impacted by your changes?
* Have you requested review by the teams of these owning components?

=== MP Review Checklist ===
Note: Please ensure you include the following form filled out and submitted along side your code to the MP ticket.

Note: A Reviewer usually is responsible for a single component; since we ask for reviewers to be subscribed that might see an impact by this MP this mean that we get one-to-many reviewers contributing to the MP review process.

Below the checklist that a reviewer should follow taking the viewpoint of his component, which might or might not be the same as the component this MP is targeted against.

* verify there is a tag in trunk for the previous version (ie, the one that the MP is against). This tag is simply the version (eg, `bzr tag 0.1.14`)
* Is debian/changelog properly formatted in the MP (see above)?
* Is the commit message properly formatted in the MP (see above)?
* Are any changes against your component pending/needed to land the MP under review in a functional state and are those called out explicitly by the submitter?
* Did you do exploratory testing related to the component you own with the MP changeset included?
* Has the submitter requested review by all the relevant teams/reviewers?
* If you are the reviewer owning the component the MP is against, have you checked that submitter has accurately filled out the submitter checklist and has taken no shortcut?

=== MP Landing Checklist ===
* ensure that the checklists have been properly filled out by submitter and all reviewers
