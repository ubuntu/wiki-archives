__TOC__

Greetings.  I'm Paul Kroll, webmaster of... some place, and long time developer (about 28 years, heaven help me... anyone remember the T.D.L. Xitan?).  I've interests in video, music, and of course, Linux... but also in the Mac (I've two of those) and yes, sorry, Windows (I've got only one of those boxes, so counting my Linux box it's three to one at the Kroll abode).

So far I've played around with <nowiki>[[http://www.kubuntu.org/|Kubuntu]]</nowiki>, and haven't yet tried the non-extra-crispy flavor of Ubuntu.  Very interested in the UbuntuMediaCenter effort.  I'm sure there's a gaming effort someplace but I haven't any hope that'll go anywhere: I'm jaded. Jaded and cynical.  And redundant. I'm jaded, cynical, and redundant.  Sometimes I repeat things.

You're starting to see why I'm so often pummeled by co-workers.

I sometimes make edits I regret, as in, what kind of pretentious crap is that? sort of posts, so feel free to annihilate my lesser works.
