=== Test Plan ===

'''This test plan is not supposed to be complete; use it to guide your manual testing so they dont miss big functional areas that are part in the component; also this should be used as guideline to inspire the exploratory testing which should be adapted smartly based on the real content of a MP'''

Please also note that the manual test described below is not as robust as a real world service. For that, please wait until the dialog titled "embedded prompt" comes up before interacting with the screen.

* Install image on phone
* Install respective silo
* Install trust-store-tests package, run <code>/usr/lib/*/trust-store-tests/mir_agent_test --gtest_filter=*.default_agent_works_correctly_against_running_mir_instance_requires_mir</code> and follow instructions on screen
** '''note''' make sure the phone is unlocked with screen on
** '''note''' wait just a bit after running the test, for it to actually create the prompt surface. You should see this on your host machine $<code>creating surface at (0, 58) with size (768, 1222) with title 'trust-prompt'</code> before striking the Deny/Grant buttons on the device
* All tests should say "SUCCESS".
