__TOC__

To be carried out by: Ubuntu Release Manager, with support from the Ubuntu Release Team

Goal:
* To get community input to improve next release.
* Looking for feedback on entire release (lessons learned across the milestones)
* Get retrospective from different viewpoints outside release team. 

Post Release and Pre-UDS:
** Set up informational blueprint session for next UDS - start with list of questions. Try to get clarification on noticed pain points and inefficiencies.
** Explicit invite attendance from release team, key community participants, marketing, web publishing, launchpad, internal support

UDS: 
** Work through questions, and open floor to others.
** Track and decide if feedback can be handled through action items or if spec is needed.
** If Spec required to address points, try to hold subsequent session at UDS to flesh it out, otherwise, work offline.
