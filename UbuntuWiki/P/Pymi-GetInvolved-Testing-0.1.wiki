== pyMi 0.1 Testing ==

Thankyou for agreeing to help out with testing with my new app pyMi - written for the <nowiki>[[http://developer.ubuntu.com/showdown/|Ubuntu App Showdown]]</nowiki>. This page explains what to do and how to let me know if you have any problems.

You can get in contact with me through <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~marrabld/+contactuser|Launchpad]]</nowiki>

For more information on getting the source code and for some screenshots go here http://causticprogramming.blogspot.com.au/2012/06/ubuntu-app-showdown-pymi.html

== Before You Begin ==

Please add my PPA 

<pre>
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:marrabld/stable
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install pymi
</pre>

=== The Tests ===

Please follow through each of these tests and if you find the functionality of the system does not work as expected, file a bug at https://bugs.launchpad.net/pymi/+filebug

For all of the tests below, a new image should be loaded from disk as per the instructions in Test 1

==== #1 : Load any 8 bit grey scale image ====

For this test you should be able to load any rasterized 8-bit gray scale image.  There are 2 test images in <code>/opt/extras.ubuntu.com/pymi/Images</code>. 

 1. Load an image using Menu->Open.
 2. Load an image using the Open icon in the toolbar.
 3. The image should be displayed in the top right window.
