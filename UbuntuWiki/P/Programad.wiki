Projects:
* Autins - A DVD that can easily restore a image of an Operating System in 15 minutes. Only free and open source software was used to create the "restore system". You can see the whole process at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dn-H3qs2NIA

Recently I've been working on:

* <nowiki>[[Artwork/Incoming/DVDCover]]</nowiki> - A DVD cover for ubuntu versions, made in Inkscape. There are 32 and 64 bit version of the cover. DVD and CD versions are available too.
