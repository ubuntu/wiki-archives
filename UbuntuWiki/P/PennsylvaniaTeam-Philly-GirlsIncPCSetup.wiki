* <nowiki>[[http://i17.tinypic.com/53qncp1.jpg|Custom Splash Screen]]</nowiki>
* # alternative=false
* # defoptions=splash
* # howmany=1
* # memtest86=false

=== Questions, Comments, and Concerns ===
# /var/log/Xorg.0.log shows "AIGLX: Screen 0 is not DRI capable".  The video chipset is nVidia Vanta/Vanta LT.  Anyway to possibly enable dri?
# We mofified grub's menu.lst file so the menu selections won't change drastically from kernel updates.  We also suppressed the (recovery mode) and memtest86+ menu items from being created.
# We disabled the 'windows' icon from showing on the desktop commenting it out in fstab.  Is there a more elegant way of doing this?
# Didn't get to enforce a disk quota for each /home/<user>.
# They expect these PCs to go home with the girls so only one user name is needed now, user1.
