=== ABOUT ME ===
----
PcSpida is my nickname.
 You are guessing right, the "PC" is an abbreviation for Prince Cobby.
 The "Spida" is cos of my abilities 2 create quality webs n networks.
 Some say im a whizkid, others say im a geek, i say i sleep, breathe, drink n talk computers. 
 How would you describe me? 
 Besides computer stuffs, i enjoy watching movies, and also playing video games. 
 
Note this; a single chat across the net with a geek is worth hours of surfing.

 All remember: 
==== Dont waste your valueable brains, trying to reinvent a wheel. Just Perfect It. ====
