=== Test Case: ubuntu-app-launch/legacy-app ===
==== Procedure ====
* Ensure that the system-settings is installed: <code>apt-cache policy ubuntu-system-settings</code>
** One of the versions in the version table should a <code>***</code> next to it
* Ensure the settings app is not currently running: <code>ubuntu-app-list</code>
** Settings shouldn't be listed
* Launch the settings application: <code>ubuntu-app-launch ubuntu-system-settings</code>
** The settings application should be brought to focus and shown to the user

=== Test Case: ubuntu-app-launch/secondary-activation ===
==== Procedure ====
* Run test case: ubuntu-app-launch/legacy-app
** Everything behaves as expected
* Use the launcher to return to the home screen
** The settings app is no longer shown
* Send a URL to the service: <code>ubuntu-app-launch ubuntu-system-settings settings:///system/battery</code>
** The settings application should come back into focus and be on the power settings pane

=== Test Case: ubuntu-app-launch/cgroup-containment ===
==== Procedure ====
* Install the Terminal app if not already installed
** It can be found in the Application Store if not currently installed
* Launch the Terminal app
** A new application should open with a terminal prompt where you can type commands
* Ensure the Terminal is in a terminal specific cgroup
** Type the command <code>cat /proc/self/cgroup</code>
** Under the "freeze" cgroup the end of the path should include the AppID of the terminal. An example would be (the version many change): <code>4:freezer:/user.slice/user-32011.slice/session-c2.scope/upstart/application-click-com.ubuntu.terminal_terminal_0.5.106</code>
