== Prestige ==

My code Name is Prestige. You may know me from the gaming world. I joined the team not too long ago, so if you can, I may need some help every now and then. Also, I am in the process of starting a computer repair business, of which will be called "Prestige Computers."

=== My Goal ===
I hope to be of assistance in the arts area of Ubuntu, so if you have any tips on how to use Gimp or any other program, I would appreciate the help. Other than that, I am very interested in being able to work with the Ubuntu team, and I hope to be of good use.

* I've seen some wicked stuff throught the years, but yours really kicks ass! - Anonymousman123 Today, during Twilight. 
* In Sweden we also have this lovely animal, as well as "knekkebrøt" and polar bears - JachniNücklycken Today, 14:23 08/10/07
* Your concept needs work, make sure you don't make it too cute. The demographic has always been those in their 20's and 30's. - FOSSArtist63 34:43 12/54/23
* I think this animal opens the way to perfect contrasts in a theme / wallpaper / whatever. It's cute in a way, but also dark and itchy, which doesn't have to be the 'Ubuntu message' but it's useful in colorshemes and so on. In other words, nice! - TotalWormage
* The platypus - a sort of strange brown penguin. Hmmmm... I think I like the idea!
