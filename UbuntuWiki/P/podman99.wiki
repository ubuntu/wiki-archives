AKA Keith Jasper - Employee of <nowiki>[[http://www.1stdomains.co.uk|1stDNS Limited]]</nowiki>.

1stDNS rely on Ubuntu Servers as their prefered Operating system, giving the flexiablity and security required to make a working hosting platform.

Our experiemental servers are all based on the latest development Ubuntu to ensure that all new/existing software/hosting configurations are compatible with the new Ubuntu's before they are out.

Keith's knowledge of Linux started many years ago with RedHat, and has, since 2005 started moving to Ubuntu, with almost all servers moved and controlled from a custom designed control panel which interacts with Ubuntu at command line level to keep servers up-to-date and secure.
