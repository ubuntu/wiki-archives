=== Requirements ===
* two additional phones
* WAIT must be provided by the operator.

=== 1. Activation of Call waiting ===
 
==== Purpose ====
This test case verifies that call waiting (WAIT) supplementary service works.

'''Note''' - This is duplicated with https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Process/Merges/TestPlans/ofono/CallHoldSwap . Probably we should remove it.

==== Steps ====
<pre>
- test-ss [modem] “*#43#”
CallWaiting : Operation [ interrogation ]
DataSyncCallWaiting : enabled
SmsCallWaiting : disabled
FaxCallWaiting : disabled
DataAsyncCallWaiting : enabled
VoiceCallWaiting : disabled
- test-ss [modem] “*43#”
CallWaiting : Operation [ activation ]
DataSyncCallWaiting : enabled
SmsCallWaiting : disabled
FaxCallWaiting : disabled
DataAsyncCallWaiting : enabled
VoiceCallWaiting : enabled
- dial-number [modem] <number1>
- Accept the call on <number1>
- We start a call from <number2> to the Ubuntu Phone. We should hear a calling indication in <number2>.
- list-calls
- swap-calls [modem]
- list-calls
</pre>

'''Note''' - the status of the various bearers may differ depending on operator/SIM.  For instance, AT&T in the US defaults ''VoiceCallWaiting'' to ''enabled'', but sets both ''Data*CallWaiting'' bearers to ''default'' whereas some operators ( see steps above ) set these both to ''enabled''. - ''awe''

=== 2. Deactivation of call waiting ===

==== Purpose ====
This test case verifies that we can deactivate the call waiting (WAIT) supplementary service.

==== Steps ====
<pre>
- test-ss [modem] “#43#”
CallWaiting : Operation [ deactivation ]
DataSyncCallWaiting : enabled
SmsCallWaiting : disabled
FaxCallWaiting : disabled
DataAsyncCallWaiting : enabled
VoiceCallWaiting : disabled
- dial-number [modem] <number1>
- Accept the call to <number1> 
- Start a call from <number2> to Ubuntu Phone, and we hear a busy tone ( or the phone rings continuously, or goes to voicemail )
- list-calls
</pre>
