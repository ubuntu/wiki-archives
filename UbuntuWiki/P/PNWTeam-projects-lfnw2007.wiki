March 5th, 2007- "I found a deal online that seemed too good to pass up.  I ordered colored business cards instead of the black and white ones.  They should be delivered in the next couple weeks.  -DanShufelt"

Please document any expenses that you incur <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PNWTeam/projects/lfnw2007/expenses|here]]</nowiki>.

January 11th, 2007 -
Table: 2x6 foot table
Power: 15 amps
Enough room for 2 (maybe 3) demo systems, and distributable media. 

== Issues ==
* We didn't bring enough pre-burnt CD's or pre-printed labels.  
* A file server with all of the ISO's on it would have been a big help.
* More table space would have allowed for more people to demo Ubuntu.

== Lessons Learned ==
The largest problem our team faced at this event was caused by under estimating the demand for CD's!  By using all of our computers (demo systems and laptops) to burn CD's we were able to satisfy most of the demand.

Going forward we should try to plan for increased demand.  Next year we should try to order a large amount of pre-made CD's and be prepared to burn plenty more.  Perhaps we should consider building a freedom toaster type burn station for the team.  This would help ensure that users get to use the demo stations.

Another challenge that arose during the fest was the inability to locate ISO images when a a specific type of CD  was requested.  Next year we should consider configuring a file server so everyone can easily find the image.

Lastly going forward I think we should attempt to procure more table space so we can provide an even more diverse set of demo systems and still have space to interact with visitors.  Virtualization may be an option for smaller venues.

Over all Linuxfest was a HUGE success!  I personally think that our team had a strong presence that was amplified by everyone having a great time.  Not to mention...  This was only our first event!
