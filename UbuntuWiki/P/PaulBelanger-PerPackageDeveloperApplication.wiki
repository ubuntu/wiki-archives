== Who I am ==
Hi, my name is Paul and I currently live in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada with my wife Lisa. I'm currently an open source developer for Asterisk. I've been using Asterisk since the 0.7.2 release and continue to do so.  My background is telecommunications and programming and consider myself knowledgeable in Asterisk.

== My Ubuntu story ==
As a self starter with Linux, I'm able to help most people with any issues they have. Additionally, I've been working to help triage issue on launchpad for the Asterisk package. My previous and current experience allow me to be comfortable providing support. I usually idle on multiple IRC channels for open source projects, providing support when I can.

I am also very interested in puppet and OpenStack! The world of automation is cool; when it works.  I've recently also started help with the OpenStack package; adding dbconfig-common support to both glance and nova.

=== Areas of work ===
* Worked with ubuntu-server team to add dbconfig-common support to glance and nova.
=== Things I could do better ===
* Not taking on too many things at one time. I sometime forget there is only 24 hours in a day.

== Plans for the future ==
=== General ===
Become more involved with packaging and testing of OpenStack. Additionally, becoming a Debian Maintainer.
=== What I like least in Ubuntu ===
Like every open source project, documentation is always lacking.  I plan to add documentation when ever possible for packaging related changes.
