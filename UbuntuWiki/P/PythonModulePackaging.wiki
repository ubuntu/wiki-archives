__TOC__

This page should be made into a more comprehensive guide.

For now, see <nowiki>[[PackagingGuide/Python]]</nowiki> for a python application packaging tutorial created from an UbuntuOpenWeek session. Although the session is about packaging Python applications, most of it still applies to packaging individual modules. In a few places there are differences which are pointed out.

That tutorial assumes that you have already packaged your module using <nowiki>[[http://docs.python.org/dist/dist.html|Python's packaging conventions]]</nowiki>. If that is not the case, you should do that first.
