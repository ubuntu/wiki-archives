Poiema is an Ubuntu community member. 

Interests include learning Python, maybe someday developing a Christian flavor of Ubuntu for use by churches and ministries or anyone looking for a Christian faith based theme within the Ubuntu community.

Also interested in either a weekly or monthly Ubuntu community newsletter - The Ubuntu Weekly Gazette? - to share highlights and spotlights from Ubuntu and our community with newcomers and those on the outside of our community.
