=== Test Case: indicator-sound/phone-headphone-media-volume-warning ===
==== Procedure ====
* NB: phone only
* NB: high volume must be unapproved at beginning at test. This can be ensured by rebooting or by running "<code>restart indicator-sound</code>" from the command line.
* On a phone, start playing multimedia that contains audio; e.g. playing audio files in the music app
* Using the 'volume down' button repeatedly, lower the volume to the lowest setting
* Plug headphones or ear buds into the phone's headphone jack
* Press the 'volume up' button repeatedly.
** At some (hardware-dependent) volume threshold, a high volume confirmation notification should appear with the label "High volume can damage your hearing" containing "OK" and "Cancel" buttons.
* Press the 'volume up' button repeatedly.
** While the confirmation notification is visible, the 'volume up' button should have no effect in raising the volume.
* Press the 'volume down' button.
** The confirmation notification should disappear
** The volume should remain unchanged
* Press the 'volume up' button to re-trigger the confirmation notification
* Press the confirmation notification's "Cancel" button
** The confirmation notification should disappear
** The volume should remain unchanged
* Press the 'volume up' button to re-trigger the confirmation notification
* Press the confirmation notification's "OK" button
** The confirmation notification should disappear
** The volume should increase by one step; ie the previous 'volume up' being applied
* Press the 'volume down' button repeatedly
** The info notification should appear, showing the volume decrease
* Cycle all the way up and down through the volume levels, starting from minimum, up to maximum, and back to minimum again.
** The info notification should appear, showing the volume changes
** The confirmation dialog should not appear, since you've confirmed high volumes already.
* From a shell, run "<code>gsettings set com.canonical.indicator.sound warning-volume-confirmation-ttl 10</code>" to change the "user has already confirmed high volume" memory to 10 seconds.
* Wait for 10 seconds to pass
* Press the 'volume up' button repeatedly.
** The confirmation notification should appear again.
* From a shell, run "<code>gsettings reset com.canonical.indicator.sound warning-volume-confirmation-ttl</code>" to restore the TTL setting to its default value.
