== Introduction ==

Name:  Jayson Vaughn

Linux user since 1995.  Started with SLS and eventually ended up with Debian.  Since 6.06 LTS was released, I switched to Ubuntu and have not looked back.  In my humble opinion, I believe the Ubuntu project is exactly what the Debian community needs to bring Debian-based distros to the front.  I am currently a contract UNIX admin and programer.  In my spare time, I try to help out the Ubuntu project in any way I can.

You can usually catch me on IRC, the FreeNode network, on #ubuntu and the like.
