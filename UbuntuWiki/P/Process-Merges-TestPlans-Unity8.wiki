=== Dependents/Clients ===

* Unity8 is the top-most component.

=== Test Plan ===

==== Desktop ====

* Child surfaces.
*** Launch kate
*** Go to menu "File" then "Open". Select some source code file that would span several pages
*** There's a "mini-map" of the text file as the right scrollbar (as of kate 16.12.1 in zesty). Let the mouse stay over it and see that a popup with a snippet of the code shows up.
*** Now move the mouse along that minimap and see that the snippet popup follows the mouse and is updated/redrawn appropriately
*** Click and hold on the minimap-scroller and move the mouse up and down. See that the page number popup is updated appropriately and follows the mouse
*** There are 3 dropdown menu buttons on the bottom right. clicking on them opens menus. Navigate one of those menus and open a sub-menu.
*** Right-click anywhere on the text body of the opened file and see that a pop-up menu opens at the expected location. 
* When the mouse is hovering over an editable text, such as Kate's main window area, verify that the cursor shape is an "I" vertical bar (instead of an arrow).

==== Convergence ====
* In addition, install updated image on phone and tablet, load packages from PPA build silo per Release team's process
* The following can be viewed as a 3 minute investigation test to ensure
** on a locked phone, you can't unlock the phone during boot without entering the passcode (<nowiki>[[http://pad.lv/1395075|BUG #1395075]]</nowiki>)
** greeter can dismiss
** indicator panel drop, connect to backends. Try launching settings from indicators, make sure all the indicators display meaningful data.
** navigating/scrolling the dash works as expected, note whether performance did not suffer
** previews in dash can be accessed (note: if change related to music and video, test those)
** OSK reveals, takes input and dismisses as expected (note: cross check known OSK bugs for any oddity)
** time out and power button blanks screen, and power button unblanks screen
** apps can be installed, note that the whole preview journey is consistent
** launcher can be accessed and launch an app (note: test a preinstalled and a click app)
** Launch a fullscreen application, such as Camera, and check that the indicators' bar is not present.
** right edge navigation between apps & dash is as expected, all apps can be closed
** find ~ -name trust.db -exec rm {} \; reboot and then test some trust prompts (location, camera picture & video recording)
** behavior associated with MPs is as expected with the relevant component, e.g. any special activity dash, indicator or launcher
* After connecting a mouse, or in a desktop session:
** verify that window title changes in browser and/or settings app
** note that mouse cursor changes around window borders
* Connect an external screen (only Nexus 4 and 7):
 ''Note this feature not complete yet, might need to boot with external screen connected to get everything working properly''
** external screen should have the shell
** internal should only show a static screen informing that external screen is in use

==== Unit tests ====

* Please run the ui unit tests tests, unless you know for certain that jenkins has run the ui tests on a silo
** use adt
  <pre>
$ adt-run unity8 -o vivid --setup-commands "apt install --yes software-properties-common; \
    apt-add-repository --yes --enable-source ppa:ci-train-ppa-service/landing-022; \
    apt update" --- schroot vivid-overlay-amd64-shm</pre>
** or run locally
** grab source from the PPA
   <pre>
$ ./build.sh
$ cd builddir
$ make test xvfbuitests</pre>
