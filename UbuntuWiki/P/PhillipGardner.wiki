__TOC__

I live in middle Tennessee in the United States.

I am a software engineer. I have been using and programming for Unix for 25 years and have had Linux on many different computers over the years.

I am currently using openSUSE 10.2 but disappointed with it; so, I may be switching to Ubuntu soon.
