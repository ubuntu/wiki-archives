__TOC__

This is Prasanna Gautam's personal page in the ubuntu wiki. Of course, if you are here, you know that:). I study at Trinity College and I'm interested, involved in open source projects. If you want to meet me, I go by the name SR71-Blackbird in irc.freenode.net on #ubuntu and #ubuntu-np.

=== Personal TODOs ===

* Fix the sound problem in my laptop
    Not a biggie actually, it's just that it goes off every once in a while because some application manages to hog it for a long time. I just want to understand it better to make/suggest for some good changes. :)

=== Involved Teams ===
 
NepalTeam

=== Interesting Teams ===
