=== About Me ===

My name is S. M. Pavel Sayekat and I am using Ubuntu GNU/Linux since 2008. I tried Ubuntu 8.04 Hardy Heron as one of my senior <nowiki>[[https://web.facebook.com/asif.nashiry | alumnus]]</nowiki> gifted the
<nowiki>[[http://imgur.com/a/FU1uH | CD]]</nowiki> to me, and instantly I fell in love with Ubuntu for the themes and colour profile and the freedom to use the OS unlike other proprietary OS and for lovely & funny package naming and even the coding comments are interesting. I keep setting up other's PC with the downloaded one's. But many of them took it for granted and when they experienced problems or lag in windows env in dual-boot windows, they just formatted the whole PC and re-setup windows.  After setting-up my own pc for the first time as dual-boot, I configured the wvdial to use net through cellular phone as Internet was not easily available at that time except through Telcos in Bangladesh and then for 2.5g modems using usb-modswitch with specific code for each modems.  I tried many Linux and Ubuntu flavours and every release of Ubuntu before Ubuntu 10.04 because after that I started using "LTS only" to be a little more stable. I fixed one of my cousin <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/dipraw | dipraw's]]</nowiki> machine (Ubuntu) over the phone, being 500 Km away by helping him in grub environment, live booting an ISO which was located in a partition as he cannot make a bootable pendrive without any working system and then fixing the broken grub.

Till now The Ubuntu Community on IRC is proving very handy for me and I specially like to mention some names like <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/belkinsa | belkinsa]]</nowiki> as she gave me a head-start otherwise I might not even face the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards | Membership Board]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/inetpro | inetpro]]</nowiki> with <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kilos | Kilos]]</nowiki> for doing some basic fixes on me and <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/elacheche | elacheche]]</nowiki> being so supportive and friendly, <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~theblazehen | theblazehen]]</nowiki> for being awesomely helpful technically, <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/chesedo | chesedo]]</nowiki> from Ubuntu-za as a friendly hand, <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/wxl | wxl]]</nowiki> for guiding me on system troubleshooting , <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Thomas%20Ward | teward]]</nowiki> for guiding me with where to find what, of course with the help of his coffee, <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MahayAlamKhan | maktrix]]</nowiki> for his advices on doing translations (oops! on Telegram.),  <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/tsimonq2 | tsimonq2]]</nowiki> for that I copied some of his contexts and still following :p,  <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Unit193 | Unit193]]</nowiki> being in the Xubuntu team, <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bashing-om | Bashing-om]]</nowiki> helping me fixing an issue with system cloning, keeping an eye on me on <nowiki>[[https://ubuntuforums.org | ubuntuforums.org]]</nowiki> and for hanging out with me on IRC, <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~flocculant | flocculant]]</nowiki> for guiding me on Bug Reporting, <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~krytarik | kryten]]</nowiki> mmmmm, the person mentioned last, helps me without even being asked, can you guys believe it?

P.S.: Person's name primarily refers to her/his IRC nicks.

=== Contributions ===

My efforts were mainly off-line efforts, like when I fix someone’s machine, I set up the machine to dualboot Ubuntu by convincing them whenever I can and I always fix my mentee(s) with Ubuntu GNU/Linux. And also I try to help out in #ubuntu-bd.

I was active in <nowiki>[[http://www.sane-project.org | SANE]]</nowiki> project trying to add support for my Canon LiDE 120 scanner, thanks to <nowiki>[[https://github.com/stefdev49 | Stephane Voltz]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~rolfbensch | Rolf Bensh]]</nowiki> from <nowiki>[[http://www.sane-project.org | SANE]]</nowiki>, specially Mr. Voltz did all the hard works.

Damped Systems under supervision of M. Abul Kawser AKA <nowiki>[[https://web.facebook.com/kawserma | Tuhin Kawser]]</nowiki>. I used C with GCC in Ubuntu to test the perturbation method and to analyse the results in comparison to Runge-Kutta method.

Zaki Chowdhury (z4ki)

I first met pavel at #ubuntu-bd irc channel. That time I was a new Ubuntu user, seeking help here and there. Meeting pavel was awesome, he helped me with many of my issues with troubleshooting and now I use Ubuntu like a friendly operating system. Pavel taught me how to help others with their problems and guided me like his younger brother. He also helped me to understand there are many other users that need help and how to support them to use Ubuntu. The most I like about pavel is he has the patience to help someone step by step until the problem is solved. At this time he is working for rebuilding our Ubuntu-bd LoCo.-- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:z4ki]]</nowiki> 
Remon Shai (RemonShai)

I first met pavel at #ubuntu-bd irc channel. As a new user(when I writing),I wanted to solve the problems here and there. He guided me like a little boy. The most I like, he has the patience to help someone step by step until the problem is solved.-- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:remonshai]]</nowiki> == Testimonials ==

Miles Sharpe (Kilos) 

I first got to know Pavel when he applied for ubuntu membership with no guidance from his none existent LoCo and no support. Belkie and I then got together in trying to revive the bd loco, and since then I have got to know Pavel as a friendly very helpful person, who apart from working to revive his loco is also helping me with the pk loco revival, Acually he is doing most of the work searching for old users and bringing them back again. In my personal opinion he has earned his membership since his last application and will continue to do so. We have become great online friends and the new peeps on the irc channel get helped everytime. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:msdomdonner]]</nowiki> 
Svetlana Belkin (belkinsa)

As a Membership Board member I remember when Pavel first applied for his Membership, he hardly had anything on his wiki page because he only was supporting/promoting Ubuntu.  Kilos and I decided to take him under our wing.  As above, Kilos stated that he had no guidance from his !LoCo, but after lots of work (mostly between Pavel and Kilos), he got his !LoCo going again and is doing work to keep it healthy.

What I also noticed, as an indirect effect, that Pavel has changed and became very, very friendly perhaps from simply copying my actions in the beginning which is fine to me.  I feel like that helped him understand how to be friendly within a greater community outside his !LoCo, and also within. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:belkinsa]]</nowiki> 

Simon Quigley (tsimonq2)

Although my main interactions with Pavel has been through offtopic channels, I support his application for Ubuntu Membership. He's a great guy to work with and has always been nice to talk to on IRC. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:tsimonq2]]</nowiki> 

Naeil ZOUEIDI (Na3iL)
 
I met Pavel the 1st time in our channel Ubuntu Africa, he is always willing to help others, I can not add much more than what already said above by all those nice people. He's an awesome person that I'm glad to know and I am sure that he will stay helpful and great guy as usual. I highly recommend him for the Ubuntu Membership.  -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:naeilzoueidi]]</nowiki> <<DateTime>>
