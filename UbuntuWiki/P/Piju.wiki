I'm a dedicated participant in the Ubuntu Hams community found at <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-hams|{{https://launchpadlibrarian.net/37961768/ubuntu-hams_14.png}}]]</nowiki><nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-hams|ubuntu-hams]]</nowiki> . <<BR>><<BR>>

With experience spanning Linux, Mac OSX, and Windows, I've been proudly utilizing Ubuntu since the Feisty days.

My interests extend from computing to amateur radio. You can catch my musings on Ubuntu's suitability as a comprehensive operating system for ham shacks on my blog at (<nowiki>[[https://hamradio.my|https://hamradio.my]]</nowiki>).<<BR>>

I hold high hopes for Ubuntu to emerge as the premier operating system for ham radio operators.
