=== Me ===

My name is Peter Grundström. I live and have always lived in Sweden, in a city called Karlstad. Here I live with my family, that consists of me, my parents and my sister. Karlstad is relatively big compared to most other cities in Sweden. It has about 90'000 inhabitants and is the main city of the Wärmland province.

I'm 17 years old and have no pets. Not that I don't like pets, it's just that I'm kind of allergic to them. I'm currently studying at this new cool education called TIME. It's a great mix of Mathematics, Physics, Computer science and a lot of other nice subjects. All with a nifty international touch. As you just might have guessed, my favourite subject is computer science. My biggest interest computers.
