=== Setting up the PS3 Controller to be used inside Steelstorm II ===

First of all let me say that this is a fantastic work that the community have done to enable PS3 controllers to be added as easily as they are.

==== Requirements ====

A computer with Ubuntu 11.10 on it <<BR>>
A bluetooth 2 Dongle or enabled pc <<BR>>
<nowiki>[[apt:--steelstorm-episode2 | Steel Storm Episode 2]]</nowiki> <<BR>>
A PS3 controller with it's usb lead <<BR>>

==== Installing QTSIXA ====

You will firstly need to add a new sources file to your list of repositories so open a terminal and do the following:
<pre>
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:falk-t-j/qtsixa
</pre>

Next we do an update and install the application like this, again in a terminal:
<pre>
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install qtsixa
</pre>

Once completed the app is installed and you are ready to start setting up the controller.  You will now need to reboot your machine.

==== Setting up the Controller ====

Initially you'll need to attach the controller to the PC via it's usb cable in order to set up the pairing between the device to the pc.

Open the dash and in search type in '''qtsixa''' and enter.  This opens the application.

Next hover over the title bar and click on the task menu, like so: <<BR>>
<nowiki>[[File:qtsixa1.png | alt qtsixa_menu | width=640 height=320]]</nowiki>

Click on '''Pair device to PC''' option.  This will now match the device id and bluetooth keys together.

Once completed you should now be able to remove the USB lead.  Press the PS3 Symbol on the controller and have it connect to your pc.

Your screen should now show up something like this:
<nowiki>[[File:qtsixa2.png | alt qtsixa_pamepad_connected | width=640 height=320]]</nowiki>

==== Common issues ====
If this fails or the Controller continually disconnects or you see the same popup box time and time again, then it maybe that the PS3 Controller system on the PC didn't startup to fix that do the following in a terminal:
<pre>
sudo /etc/init.d/sixad start
</pre>
Then press the PS3 button again it should now connect and rumble to confirm.

==== Additional Reading for QTSIXA ====
There is a PDF instruction manual for QTSIXA locate <nowiki>[[http://qtsixa.sourceforge.net/manual.pdf|here]]</nowiki>
==== Enabling the controller in Steel Storm Episode2 ====

Open Steel Storm episode 2.  If this is the first time then setup a profile.

Next Click on '''Controls''' <<BR>>
Next Click on the '''Input''' Tab and highlight '''Enable Gamepad'''

Click on back and then start the game and enjoy.
