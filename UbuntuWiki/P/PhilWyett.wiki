Hi! I am Philip Wyett (just call me Phil), an open source user, developer and advocate. Since the year 2000 I have been one of the developers and maintainers of the Open Source <nowiki>[[http://www.crystalspace3d.org|Crystal Space 3D SDK]]</nowiki>. Though all my early involvement was with the Windows port, it fueled my interest in Open Source Software and the advantages of it. These days I work and code primarily on GNU Linux with my main equipment running Ubuntu.

=== FOSS Activities ===

Crystal Space is an open-source 3D software development kit. It can be used for a variety of 3D visualization tasks. Many people will probably be interested in using Crystal Space as the basis of a 3D game, for which it is ideally suited.
