I´m average Ubuntu user since 2006.I tried other distros,but always coming back to Ubuntu.Most of what I have learned about Ubuntu has been googling,reading ubuntu forums,my local Ubuntu forum(Ubuntu .hr) and experimenting with Ubuntu.First answer to my question I received from <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu-hr.org/|Ubunutu.hr]]</nowiki>.After that I registered on Ubuntu forums.

'''Activity'''

You can find me on Ubuntu forums answering questions most of the time under Installation & Upgrades and General help subforums.I enjoy answering unanswered questions so I become member of Unanswered Posts Team in 2009.Year later I started to translate LXDE to Croatian and become Lubuntu member.Recently I translated some components of XFCE.
