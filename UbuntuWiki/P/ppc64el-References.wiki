=== Comprehensive PMU Event Reference ===

The POWER7 processor has a built in performance monitoring unit (PMU) for each hardware thread, which
provides instrumentation to aid in performance monitoring, workload characterization, system characterization
and code analysis.
There are 6 thread-level Performance Monitor Counters (PMC) in a PMU. PMC1 – PMC4 are programmable,
PMC5 counts non idle completed instructions and PMC6 counts non idle cycles.
The thread level and core level instrumentation have access to a rich set of performance events (close to
550) that cover essential statistics such as miss rates, unit utilization, thread balance, hazard conditions,
translation related misses, stall analysis, instruction mix, L1 I cache and D cache reload source, effective
cache counts and memory latency counts.
This document covers all of the performance monitoring events supported by…
