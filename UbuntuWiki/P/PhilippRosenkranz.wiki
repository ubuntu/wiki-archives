Hi, i am Philipp Rosenkranz
I am interessted in everything that deals with network stuff. (Server Systems,Routers,...)

currently i'am trying to get some informations about directory servers in conjunction with ubuntu server systems.
Maybe i will manage to extend the Directory Server spec ( in launchpad).

If i only had more spare time...
My alternative civil service keeps me busy...  ;-(
