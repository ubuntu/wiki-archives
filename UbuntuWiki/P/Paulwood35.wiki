Hi, this is my first Wiki page. I have used Ubuntu a number of times on my desktop and laptop (IBM T42); by far the most useable and preferred linux distribution is Ubuntu. I really enjoy the apt-get feature; I am currently trying to learn enough about Ubuntu to be able to show other how to use it well, yet I am not quite there; and would appreciate any help, tips or tricks to using and customizing Ubuntu. One of my major hitches with Ubuntu is that I can never get the startup applications of ClamAV (?) and FireStarter to start up without any errors or manual inputs.
