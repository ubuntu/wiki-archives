I'm a Common Lisp packaging addict and would like to help supporting my <nowiki>[[http://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=pvaneynd|debian packages]]</nowiki> in (k)ubuntu.

To coordinate the packaging I created the <nowiki>[[MOTU/Teams/CommonLisp]]</nowiki> Team. I should be able to work on ubuntu on a part-time (very part) basis.
