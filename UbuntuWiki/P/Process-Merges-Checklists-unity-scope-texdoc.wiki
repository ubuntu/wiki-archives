=== MP Review Checklist Template ===
<pre>
Note: Please ensure you include the following form filled out and submitted along side your code to the MP ticket.
Note: A Reviewer usually is responsible for a single component; since we ask for reviewers to be subscribed that might see an impact by this MP this mean that we get one-to-many reviewers contributing to the MP review process.

Below the checklist that a reviewer should follow taking the viewpoint of his component, which might or might not be the same as the component this MP is targeted against.

* Are any changes against your component pending/needed to land the MP under review in a functional state and are those called out explicitly by the submitter?
* Did you do exploratory testing related to the component you own with the MP changeset included?
* Has the submitter requested review by all the relevant teams/reviewres?
* If you are the reviewer owning the component the MP is against, have you checked that submitter has accurately filled out the submitter checklist and has taken no shortcut?
</pre>

=== MP Landing Checklist Template ===
