__TOC__

KDE developer since 2006 (2005? can't remember)

Debian packager (I maintain <nowiki>[[http://packages.debian.org/libmsn|libmsn]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[http://packages.debian.org|witty]]</nowiki>), see <nowiki>[[http://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=pgquiles%40elpauer.org|my QA page in Debian]]</nowiki>

I maintain <nowiki>[[https://edge.launchpad.net/~pgquiles/+archive/ppa|the largest PPA in Launchpad]]</nowiki>. For the Ubuntu versions I have in use (Hardy and Jaunty at this moment), I:
* provide backports of Ubuntu and Debian packages,
* package new versions not yet in Ubuntu or Debian
* package stuff not yet accepted in Debian (e. g. osgppu, libsnmp++, etc; it might be that the packaging is not good enough, that I have no sponsor yet, etc)

I am also quite versed in CMake, Linux administration and software development and porting software across platforms (Linux <--> Windows, gcc <--> Visual C++ <-->Intel C++ <--> Sun CC, etc)
