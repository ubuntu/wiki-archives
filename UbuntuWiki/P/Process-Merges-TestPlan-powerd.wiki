=== Test Plan ===

This test plan is not supposed to be complete; use it to guide your manual testing so they don't miss big functional areas that are part in the component; also this should be used as guideline to inspire the exploratory testing which should be adapted smartly based on the real content of a MP.

=== Test Case: powerd/screen-off ===
==== Procedure ====
* With the screen on, quick-press the power button once to turn the screen off
** The screen should go black
** The backlight should turn off; e.g. the screen should be dark rather than glowing black
** The backlight should only turn off once; it shouldn't flicker off-on-off.
