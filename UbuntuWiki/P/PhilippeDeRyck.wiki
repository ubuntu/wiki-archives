=== Experience ===
I have studied ''Applied Informatics'' at KHL, and I am currently studying ''Computer Science'' at KUL. In my spare time I am a voluntary system administrator at a local high school. I have some experience managing Linux-servers (personal mail server, samba server, backup server, webserver, vservers), MS Windows servers (domain controllers), MS Windows workstations and soon Xubuntu workstations.

=== Preferred tasks ===
As a team member of Ubuntu-be I'd like to help out where possible. I think I'm most valuable on the technical side (sysadmin, development, ...). If there are some texts that need to be written, maybe I can help with that too. My mother tongue is Dutch, but English should work too. I understand French, but will not be able to write flawlessly :)
