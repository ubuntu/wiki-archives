For most users this will be a set of predefined values as determined by the configuration utility, but advanced users can change it to anything strftime can accept. Look at the man page on strftime for more information.
* locations - Adds the list of locations the user has configured to display in the indicator-datetime menu.
* show-calendar - Puts the monthly calendar in indicator-datetime's menu.
* show-clock - Controls whether the clock indicator appears in the panel or not.

* show-events - Shows events from Evolution in indicator-datetime's menu.
* show-locations - Shows custom defined locations in indicator-datetime's menu.
* show-seconds - Makes the datetime indicator show the number of seconds in the indicator. It's important to note that this will cause additional battery drain as the time will update 60 times as often, so it is not recommended.  Also, this setting will be ignored if the time-format value is set to custom.
* show-week-numbers - Shows the week numbers in the monthly calendar in indicator-datetime's menu.
* time-format - Controls the time format that is displayed in the indicator. For almost all users this should be the default for their locale. If you think the setting is wrong for your locale please join or talk to the translation team for your language. If you just want something different you can adjust this to be either 12 or 24 time.  Or, you can use a custom format string and set the custom-time-format setting.
* timezone-name: Some timezones can be known by many different cities or names. This setting describes how the current zone prefers to be named.  Format is "TIMEZONE NAME" (e.g. "America/New_York Boston" to name the New_York zone Boston).
