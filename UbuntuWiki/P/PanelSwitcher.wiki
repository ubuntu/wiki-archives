Application to switch between different panel layout profiles in Gnome

=== About ===
Not everyone loves the default placement of the panels in Gnome, and I’m one of them.

The Panel Switcher makes it possible to save and import panel layout settings. For each configuration it is possible to store a screenshot. Hopefully this will encourage users to experiment with different panel layouts, and share their layouts with others. The Panel switcher is shipped with some layout configurations. If you would like to contribute, please send me your layout and I will add it to the official release.

Panel switcher is implemented in Python, PyGTK and the Python bindings for GConf.

This project is developed by Peter Moberg and was part of Google Summer of Code 2006. Mentors at Ubuntu where Sebastien Bacher and Vincent Untz.
