__TOC__

<nowiki>[[http://phyz.ath.cx/|Dax Phyz]]</nowiki> is a 2.5D physics engine with built-in editor and DirectX graphics and sound.

Designed to be fast and programmable, Phyz can be used to model, simulate and explore a wide variety of physical phenomena.

Phyz takes a stochastic, vertex based approach to modelling, allowing massive numbers of micro objects, simulation of Brownian motion and macro effects such as object resonance, deformation and demolition.

Using a simple message based interface, external applications such as PhyzLizp can measure and control Phyz, implement non-linear constraints, respond to real-world events or the events of a virtual game world.

Phyz is actively being developed as a teaching aid in Lund, Sweden. All software, source code, images, scenes and models on this site are in the public domain, free to use without restrictions.
