== Packaging Guidelines for Describing Description Field ==
[-- a proposal for a standard method --]

This page is being developed towards a possible standard method for the Description field in a package description. This proposed guideline will lend uniformity across package sets and packages as to what is displayed to the user. 

MULTI-PACKAGE SETS: A single application name needs to be used across the whole set. This preferably should be what is shown in the application name. Any sub-package modules should try and follow a similiar method. The end result should be a uniform Description field across the set.

  (eg. aspell-en: English dictionary for GNU ASpell; aspell-da Danish dictionary for GNU Aspell [not as it is now])

Below is a list of known package sets and their preferred application name.
=== A B C ===
* '''Aspell''' --- GNU ASpell
* '''Asterix''' --- Asterix PBX
=== D E F ===
=== G H I ===
=== J K L ===
=== M N O ===
=== P Q R ===
=== S T U ===
=== V W X ===
=== Y Z ===
