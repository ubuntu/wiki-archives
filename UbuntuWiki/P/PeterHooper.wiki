I've installed Ubuntu 5.10 on my Dell Inspiron 6000 and was amazed at the detection, good work chaps. Only thing not working is 'forward' and 'back' on my 5-button optical mouse. I would have liked to see a 'Ubuntu Tour' when I installed to familiarise me with the interface. But apart from these minor niggles I'm impressed.
