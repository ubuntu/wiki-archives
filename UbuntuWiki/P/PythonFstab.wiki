__TOC__

python-fstab is a Python module for reading, manipulating, and writing /etc/fstab files. It is written
to make it easier to implement a plugin for '''system-cleaner''' (see CleanupCruft) to update fstab
with new mount options. It should be helpful for other tools that need to touch /etc/fstab.

The bzr branch resides at http://bazaar.launchpad.net/%7Esystemcleaner-hackers/systemcleaner/python-fstab/

This wiki page acts as the home page, at least for now.
