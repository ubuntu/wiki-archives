Installing and configuring a simple Plone site for Edgy, and simple stuff for newbies (like me).

== Basic setup ==

Enable universe in /etc/apt/sources.list

apt-get install plone-site

== Backing up a database ==

You can back up a database whilst it is running (see link below), or you can shutdown, backup and restart.

=== Offline approach ===

Use this method to shutdown, backup, and restart a Plone site.

Stop the zope instance:
/etc/init.d/zope2.9 stop

Start the zop instance:
/etc/init.d/zope2.9 start
