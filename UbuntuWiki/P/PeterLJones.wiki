<nowiki>[[http://www.drealm.info/contact.xhtml|My Home Page]]</nowiki> has more info about me outside Ubuntu-sphere.

More specifically than just prowling the <nowiki>[[audio]]</nowiki>/<nowiki>[[MIDI]]</nowiki> side of things, I did a hack to <nowiki>[[wineasio]]</nowiki> to use a config file.  This made it much quicker to set up routing between multiple applications in <nowiki>[[JACK]]</nowiki>.
