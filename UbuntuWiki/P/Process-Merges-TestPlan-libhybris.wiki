=== Test Plan ===

'''This test plan is not supposed to be complete; use it to guide your manual testing so they dont miss big functional areas that are part in the component; also this should be used as guideline to inspire the exploratory testing which should be adapted smartly based on the real content of a MP'''

Libhybris is a core component that touches many different areas, and the behavior also depends a lot on the hardware used (and the binary drivers), so the best way to validate it is via exploratory testing (on many different areas).

==== Installing libhybris ====

* Install latest image on phone
* Install freshly build libhybris packages that are needed for landing and reboot
