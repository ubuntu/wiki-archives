The Ubuntu Pennsylvania team will have a table at CPOSC 2009, we will be handing out CDs, giving demos, and answering questions about Ubuntu.

We will be a "bronze" level <nowiki>[[http://www.cposc.org/sponsors|sponsor]]</nowiki>, which will give us exposure on their handouts, marketing materials, and a non-profit level table at the event.

You will also need to register for this event, but we'll be doing shifts at the table so you'll be able to see many of the talks too!
