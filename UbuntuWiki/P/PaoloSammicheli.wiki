=== LoCo Marketing Team ===
In January 2007 <nowiki>[[http://forum.ubuntu-it.org/index.php/topic,56894.0.html|I proposed]]</nowiki> to the Italian Community Council the creation of an Italian Marketing Team (later named <nowiki>[[http://wiki.ubuntu-it.org/GruppoPromozione|Gruppo Promozione]]</nowiki>).

=== Testimonials ===

I would like to leave my testimonial for Paolo. I've been knowing him since almost the beginning of the Italian community, with him we started the Italian newsletter, a "spin-off" of the UWN, with his help we've organized the first Ubuntu-it meeting and from his idea the Italian '''Gruppo sviluppo''' (the Italian counterpart of the international development team) was born; he still is part of the translation team and helps us translating interviews other than software. He always has great ideas, he is a passionate and very active open source and free software advocate. I would highly recommend him. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:milo]]</nowiki> 
Paolo has been a consistent and very valuable contributor to the Italian team for a long time now, he is an excellent candidate for membership. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:mdke]]</nowiki> 
I would like to sponsor Paolo for his membership. He's one of the first member of the Italian community and his enthusiasm is not went down during the years. He has worked for the organization of the first Ubuntu Italian Meeting and now he works in several projects of our community! He's a very good member of Ubuntu as well as a great person! You rock! -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:hattory]]</nowiki> 
Paolo is a great force behind ubuntu-it and a very nice person, too. His contribution to the Italian team is excellent! <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:lorenzosfarra]]</nowiki> 
I am very happy to add here my personal testimonial for Paolo, a delightful fellow in our team. During these years he had always contributed with firm belief and competence to a large part of our activities. He has joined the '''Gruppo Web''' (the Ubuntu Italian Website Team) at the very beginning and since then he was a strategic contributor. I would highly recommend him for the membership. <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:thesaltydog]]</nowiki>
