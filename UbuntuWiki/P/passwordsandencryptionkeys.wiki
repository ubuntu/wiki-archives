=== Passwords and Encryption Keys ===

The application in applications > accessories > "passwords and encryption keys" provides access to "key rings".  

=== Troubleshooting ===

If you are having an issue with the keyring asking for a password, you can open "passwords and encryption keys" and delete your keyring in order to create a new one by deleting the keyring(s) under "passwords" (Warning any saved passwords will be lost if you delete them).  This should cause a new keyring from being created, and so long as one's user password is utilized as the password you use for the keyring, one shouldn't be prompted for a password for their keyring again.
