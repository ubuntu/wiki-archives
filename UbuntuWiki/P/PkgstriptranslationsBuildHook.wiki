=== Summary ===

Currently `dh_builddeb` is patched to call `pkgstriptranslations` before building a deb. This should be replaced with a less intrusive and more generic hook.

=== Rationale ===

Joey Hess does not like modifying debhelper for these purposes. In addition, there are packages which provide translations, but do not use debhelper (e. g. `gnupg`).

=== Use cases ===

=== Scope ===

=== Design ===

* Remove the `debhelper` change.
* Divert `dpkg-deb` in `pkgstriptranslations`: This should call `pkgstriptranslations` and then call the original `dpkg-deb`.

=== Implementation ===
