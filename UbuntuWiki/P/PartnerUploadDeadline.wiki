__TOC__

Ideally, our OEM partners should be following the "release early, release often" process.  However, we understand that this cannot always happen.  This is the '''last point''' at which you need to have '''''something''''' uploaded into the archive, or submitted to your Canonical engineering contact for your hardware enablement or new feature work. This is 2 weeks before FeatureFreeze.<<BR>>
