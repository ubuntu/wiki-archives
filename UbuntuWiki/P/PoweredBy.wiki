In order to view these correctly in Inkscape, you need to install the Ubuntu Title font and the MSTTCORE Fonts, like so:

Or you can install them with Adept, Synaptic, or whatever you heart desires. You will need the <code>Universe</code> and <code>Multiverse</code> repositories setup. For more information please visit the <nowiki>[[Repositories]]</nowiki> wiki page.
== Introduction ==
After seeing a bunch of powered by stickers recently, I decided to whip up 4 quick ones for Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Edubuntu, and Xubuntu. Please feel free to edit them to your liking. They are currently designed for 2 inches (wide) by 3 inches (tall). Being svg files, you can use Inkscape to make them any size you wish.

The following are the available images in Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) format. You need Inkscape or other SVG capable image editor in order to edit these images.

'''NOTE:''' I know that the Powered by Xubuntu SVG file looks goofy on the page, however it is actually a good file, it just renders incorrectly on the wiki.
