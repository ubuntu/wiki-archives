__TOC__

Packages-arch-specific is a database listing on which arches some packages should not be built.

Upstream maintenance is done in Debian; see:
https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2008-December/027076.html

And the Ubuntu branch is <nowiki>[[https://code.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-core-dev/packages-arch-specific/ubuntu|lp:~ubuntu-core-dev/packages-arch-specific/ubuntu]]</nowiki> and can be pushed to by core-devs.  Do file an upstream bug before applying your changes!

It's preferable to merge the changes from upstream which is regularly imported via <nowiki>[[https://code.launchpad.net/+branch/packages-arch-specific|lp:packages-arch-specific]]</nowiki>.

After architectures have been added in the Ubuntu branch, wait until the next 2pm London time and upload your source package again to trigger a build on the new arches.  If the new arches aren't picked up, ping buildd admins.
