__TOC__

I use Linux at home (Oudenaarde, Belgium) since 1998. 
Like most people I tasted several flavors: Dragon Linux (which ran through windows but which was buggy and eventually discontinued), Debian, Mandrake, Suse, Mandriva, Suse again, and since about a  year, Ubuntu. 
In everyday life I am a reporter at a local tv-station in Ghent, East-Flanders. So I maintain quite a lot of press contacts in the region. I aim to spread the Linux- and open source-spirit at work (by sharing general information, news scoops, with collegues -I don't see them as competition- which gets me information in return), and by advertising Linux and open source in general to anyone I meet.
I hope to be able to make a contribution to the community by advertising, and by translating software (English to Dutch) as much as I can.
No man or woman is an island, so I hope sharing the efford can double it.
