== SMS Tests ==

=== 1. Receive an Incoming SMS with a Short Number or Alphanumeric Sender ===

==== Purpose ====
Text messages can be sent from sources other than another phone.  In these circumstances, the “Sender” is not a valid phone number, but instead can be a short string of digits ( eg. 45698 ), or an alphanumeric string.

Text messages sent from Skype typically display a short string of digits.  It's also possible to trigger an SMS sent from an operator via USSD commands.  For instance, the following USSD command will trigger a usage report from AT&T in the US:

<pre>
$ send-ussd “*3282#”
</pre>

=== 2. Verify Delivery for Outgoing SMS ===

=== 3. Verify Deliver Failed for Outgoing SMS ===

== SMS Emoji Tests ==
