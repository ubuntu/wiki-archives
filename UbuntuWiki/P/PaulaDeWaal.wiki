__TOC__

I am one of the many e-professionals dealing with research on e-learning, e-teaching, quality and innovation. Other places where i can be found are www.moodle.org and the University of Padova (Italy). I ended up in this wiki in an very authomatic way: after adding some lines of translation to the italian version of Elgg, this ubuntu-wiki page was there, inviting me to present myself :-)
