'''I, Paolo Pisati, am applying for DKMS upload rights.'''

I am applying because I am heavily involved with preparing new upstream kernels for Ubuntu. This work includes compatibility updates for the various DKMS modules in Ubuntu, both in the development series and in LTS releases. I would like to be able to sponsor these uploads in order to reduce delays in getting sponsorship and to reduce the burden on other sponsors. 

== Who am I ==
I work at Canonical since 2011 as a Kernel Engineer in the <nowiki>[[KernelTeam|{{https:--launchpadlibrarian.net-7080714-ubuntu-kernel-team-small.png}}]]</nowiki><nowiki>[[KernelTeam|Ubuntu Kernel Team]]</nowiki>.

I received a Master degree in Computer Science at the University of Milan, Italy in 2003. Since, then I have contributed to many open-source projects, in particular FreeBSD and the Linux kernel.

== My Ubuntu story ==
Ubuntu user since Lucid (10.04).

=== Examples of my work / Things I'm proud of ===

Here is a list of DKMS (and other packages) i worked on:
https://launchpad.net/~p-pisati/+uploaded-packages

=== Areas of work ===
My primary focus is to get new upstream kernel into Ubuntu, and fix packages impacted by these uploads. I am also involved in the stable series.

=== Things I could do better ===
My overall packaging experience is almost entirely within kernel (or kernel-adjacent) packages, thus expanding to some userspace would be beneficial.

== Comments ==
''If you'd like to comment, but are not the applicant or a sponsor, do it here. Don't forget to sign with `@``SIG``@`.''

== Endorsements ==
''As a sponsor, just copy the template below, fill it out and add it to this section.''

==== General feedback ====

Having sponsored Paolo's work many times, I can vouch for Paolo's eye for detail, and excellent work, and I fully endorse his application for DKMS upload rights.

==== Specific Experiences of working together ====

Paolo has contributed to quite a few DKMS packages, keeping them compatible with our latest kernels. Here is a, by no means exhaustive, list of package uploads I have sponsored for Paolo:

<<BR>>
All I can say is that Paolo has been a huge help, and a pleasure to work with.

==== Areas of Improvement ====

Nothing I can think of.

=== Timo Aaltonen ===
==== General feedback ====

I've sponsored eight uploads for Paolo, mostly for SRU dkms updates, some for devel series. There have been some minor changes needed, like buglink missing but nothing major.

==== Specific Experiences of working together ====

Sponsored packages: sysdig, broadcom-sta, dpdk-kmods, rtl8812au, openafs, evdi, jool

==== Areas of Improvement ====

Can't think of anything.

=== xnox ===
==== General feedback ====
I have uploaded multiple dkms fix-ups from paolo. But also worked together on resolving autopkgtest migration issues, and disentangle things for proposed migration. Not only he has good working knowledge of day to day uploads. He is also conscious of stepping back, and observing the process overall to improve it overall.

==== Specific Experiences of working together ====
Many

==== Areas of Improvement ====
The next step in packaging experience would be working more on userspace packages with abi transitions.
