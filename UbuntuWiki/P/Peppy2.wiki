=== Me and GNU/Linux ===
Ubuntu is my first GNU/Linux experience and I'll really enjoy it (to be honest I tried Suse for a couple of months before). After my first install almost a year ago (yes I'm still a newbie :( ) I fallen in love with GNU/Linux  and cant change OS any more ;) .

It's a specially the community and the ease of use that made me choose Ubuntu.
=== About me ===
At the moment I'm still student at the University of Applied Sciences Wester Switzerland. But I hope to by an IT Manager in February 2008 (hope doesn't really takes place there I'm working to reach this goal). 
=== Witch Ubuntu am I running ?? ===
I first started with Ubuntu Edgy Eft but I upgraded to Feisty Fawn on my laptop. 

I'll also run Xubuntu Feisty Fawn on a old desktop witch had the same effect then a Fountain of Youth on it ;)
