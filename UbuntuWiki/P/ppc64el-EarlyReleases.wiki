== LTS ==
=== 14.04.3 Early Release ===

It is possible to install the preview version of 14.04.3 in your system, even before it is GA. You can do that to start playing with a more recent kernel, 3.19 in this case.

In order to do so, you can just install the following packages in your current 14.04.2 installation:

<pre>
### apt-get update
### apt-get install linux-image-3.19.0-18-generic linux-image-extra-3.19.0-18-generic
### reboot

</pre>

After that, you should have 3.19 kernel installed, as shown:

<pre>
    $ uname -r
    3.19.0-18-generic
</pre>
