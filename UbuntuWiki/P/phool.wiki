== Introduction ==

Hi!

I've been a linux user for a few years, and figured that it is about time to 
try to learn something new, and maybe even contribute to the community.
I live in Denmark, and at the moment i am an electronics apprentice.

== Community Involvement ==

Haven't been involved in any projects yet

=== Ubuntu Beginners Team ===
* Padawan on the <nowiki>[[BeginnersTeam|Ubuntu Beginners Team]]</nowiki> since November 6th, 2011

== Future Hopes ==
My short term goal is to become better at programming in the languages that i know(and maybe some that i don't), while hopefully contributing to the community. 

Long term goal:
Getting even better, and contribute some more :)
