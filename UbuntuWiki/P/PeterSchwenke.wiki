__TOC__

I've worked in the software industry since 1986.  Linux has been my chosen Operating System since 1994.  I believe that the Ubuntu distribution and community is the one of the most positive developments I've seen in that time.

I try to help out by answering questions in the forums.  I am known as bluetoad in the forums and IRC.  I am also trying to help out by reporting and fixing some bugs for Dapper.
