__TOC__

I live in Columbus Ohio with a partner, Tanya, 2 kids, 3 birds and 2 cats.  Tanya is a midwife and my kids were born at home.  A rarity in the US.  She has attended over 160 home births.

<nowiki>[[http://www.linuxcolumbus.com]]</nowiki> is my web site.  My day job involves mainframes, cobol, sql, unix and a lot of headaches.  I've following in love with Python, but perl and php are jealous. 

I'm into ham radio and his callsign is N8VW.  I hold several records in ham radio contests.  I've operated from the US, the Netherland Antilles and Costa Rica.

Here is what I've been working on that is Ubuntu related:

1. Distribute Ubuntu CDs at work.  I've given out 16 CDs to various people and found a few already users via my e-mail sig "Ask me about Ubuntu".  

2. Providing support to my Wife's Ubuntu desktop.

3. Demoing Ubuntu to friends and family.  A friends son is interested in getting it installed on his laptop.  We are setting up a time for for him to install and me to answer questions.

4. Next step is to install a Ubuntu Desktop at a friends business along with vmware for the em-dollar stuff.
