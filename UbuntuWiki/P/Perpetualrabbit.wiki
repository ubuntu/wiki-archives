Scibuntu

Ideas about scientific version of ubuntu here.
The general plan is to have a virtual installation target like 'edubuntu' and 'kubuntu', that installs all kinds of programs useful to scientist in a number of fields.
The target would be called 'scibuntu'.
I work for a physics department myself, and I would like to see updated versions of some programs in there, for instance scigraphica 2.0.1, where now only 0.8x exists in the debian archives. 
Things to think about:
- menu structure
- lists of useful programs per discipline (i.e. physics, mathematics, biology, astronomy, psychology, anthropology etc.)
- how to get people to help with this project.
