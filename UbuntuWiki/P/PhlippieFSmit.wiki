Hi, my name is Phlippie Smit.  I live in South Africa and is very keen on open source software.  I am an avid Linux supporter and evangelist in the corporate environment I work in.  I have started with the Afrikaans translation of the "SchoolTool" project - Ja, as jy die taal kan praat is ek bly!  The translation is being done as my contribution to the open source community as well as Afrikaans users of the software, and also to propose it to schools in my immediate environment.  I am part of a small team who is busy with research (and development) in the area of high-school ICT education and out of school ICT interventions.  The ideas we are playing around with and things we envisage tie in very much with what is published and discussed on Mark Shuttleworth's site (www.markshuttleworth.com) under education.

I trust you will find the translation useful.  Watch this site for further additions and discussions about the translation, and other contributions to ubuntulinux
