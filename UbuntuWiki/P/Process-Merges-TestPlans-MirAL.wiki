=== Test Plan ===

'''This test plan is not supposed to be complete; use it to guide your manual testing so they don't miss big functional areas that are part in the component; also this should be used as guideline to inspire the exploratory testing which should be adapted smartly based on the real content of a MP'''

* Successful run of automated CI testing
* Install packages from build silo
** Ensure that miral-examples is installed
* install kate, neverball, qtubuntu-desktop, mir-graphics-drivers-desktop, mir-demos, qterminal
* Run the example: ''$ miral-desktop''
** This should switch you to a miral "desktop" on VT4 with a gnome terminal window
** Ensure that gtk applications (e.g. gedit) can be launched from the terminal and used
** ''At present, on Artful, gtk-mir doesn't always render to the correct size. MirAL/Mir is not thought to be the cause.''
** Ensure that Qt applications (e.g. kate) can be launched from the terminal and used
** ''At present kate has problems on qemu-kvm - it presents a blank, unresponsive, "untitled" window. This is Mir bug lp:1639745 (see second note below).''
** Ensure that SDL applications (e.g. neverball) can be launched from the terminal and used
** ''At present SDL applications sometimes exhibit problems on exit (7kaa often segfaults, neverball often hangs). MirAL/Mir is not thought to be the cause.''
** Exit the MirAL desktop by closing the terminal session
* Run the example: ''$ sudo mir_demo_server --vt 4 --arw-file --window-manager system-compositor''
** This should switch you to VT4 with blank screen
** switch back to your desktop and start another terminal session (used for the next two tests)
* Run the example: ''$ miral-app --host /tmp/mir_socket --window-manager tiling''
** switch back to VT4
** This should switch you to a tiling MirAL "desktop" on VT4 with a fullscreen gnome terminal
** ''repeat the application sanity tests as above'' the active application will be on the left of the display
** after exiting the terminal session switch back to your desktop
* Run the example: ''$ miral-app -kiosk -launcher qterminal --host /tmp/mir_socket''
** switch back to VT4
** This should switch you to a tiling MirAL "desktop" on VT4 with a fullscreen qterminal
** ''repeat the application sanity tests as above'' the active application will be fullscreen
** after exiting the terminal session exit mir_demo_server by Ctrl-Alt-BkSp

'''Note:''' To "kill" an unresponsive app use Alt-Shift-F4

'''Note:''' MirAL relies heavily on Mir, and therefore can only work on configurations where Mir itself works. To check that Mir works follow the following steps:

* install mir-demos, mir-graphics-drivers-desktop
* Run the example: ''$ sudo mir_demo_server --vt 4 --launch mir_demo_client_egltriangle''

You should see a spinning triangle.

It is also worth checking that any problem applications work with Mir.

* For example: ''sudo mir_demo_server --vt 4 --launch kate''

If this also fails in the same way, then the problem is unlikely to be MirAL. (At the time of writing lp:1639745 is affecting running GL applications on various VMs.)
