__TOC__

=== Package Management BoF: Tuesday, 1900 ===

=== Warty ===

Synaptic as default mechanism, not much more.

=== Hoary ===
Lots of shiny new stuff either already here or on the way.

==== upgrade-notifier ====
* notification area icon (icon needs work)
* based on cronjob as root for apt-get update can't ask it to update and then download
* runs update-manager or synaptic with gksudo if upgrades are available
 
==== update-manager ====
* actually show new updates; shells out Synaptic to do the real work (downloading/installing)
 
==== gnome-app-install ====
* pygtk app: xdg menus translated into add/remove apps, with same structure
* uses its own .desktop files, collected at build time                             for Hoary
* ui argument about insta-apply vs set stuff + apply vs confirm-on-apply;                      consensus on instant-apply (because you usually want to only install one application in this use-case)

==== gnome-software-properties ====
* shiny
* system settings -> software properties should go
* have this dialog as the Preferences button from g-a-i/synaptic
* fix displayed version (it's 4.10;5.04)
* make the update-intervall configurable

==== misc ====
* add action "update" to some point in the menu
* maybe there should be some decentralized way to download packages, like BitTorrent, in addition to HTTP download?
