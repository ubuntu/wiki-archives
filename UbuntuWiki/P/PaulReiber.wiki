Hi! I'm PaulReiber.  I'm a Linux Trainer, Hacker, Author/Proofreader, and occasional Entrepreneur, as well as an avid Ubuntu enthusiast.

Since I've done a good amount of software development and systems administration over the past 25 years, I'm good at debugging, isolating odd problems, and recognizing design deficiencies.

Sure that's not ALL there is to know, but it's a start. :-)
