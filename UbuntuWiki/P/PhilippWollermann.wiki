==== Ni hao! ====

My name is Philipp Wollermann, I'm from Germany and at the moment I'm 18 years old.

I'm quite new to Ubuntu Linux but I've already used many other distributions - I started with Suse Linux 5.3 and used several versions, which I can't really remember. I tried Mandrake Linux too and liked it, however the fees for being a club member are way too high for me. I've been using CRUX Linux for several projects of my own (my VDR watch-record-cut-and-burn-TV PC or some really strange things like an experimental distro using PHP based initscripts ;)) and I'm now searching for a distro, which fits nicely on my desktop. Ubuntu seems to be exactly the right thing. Update: I now installed it on my desktop and it worked. :) Looks very nice, but I'll try Kubuntu too. Usually I like KDE more.. I'll switch between both environments, until I really choose my favourite one.

I've now used Kubuntu for some weeks and I like KDE more. Even KDevelop works.. a completely new experience, as usually the documentation indexing didn't work at all (thanks to htdig). Now I only have to get a start in developing for Linux.

I'll see how I can give something back to the (K)Ubuntu project. When I've looked through the whole concept of Ubuntu, I'll probably take on the work for the Ubuntu Small Business Server - I can combine two hobbies: coding PHP (for the webinterface) and constructing a distribution.. However for a first start I will try to help some users in the Ubuntu Forums. :)

'''Update, 25.07.2005''' - At the moment I'm working as an intern at the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven, Germany. The people here use computers made by Apple for their work and they lent me an iBook for three weeks. :) I'm already thinking about which specific features of Mac OS could make Kubuntu even more user-friendly.. because I also want to get started with Linux development, I'll try to improve wlassistant, a tool to simplify connecting to wireless networks. Mac OS has a very intuitive way of dealing with WLANs and I think it's not too difficult to enhance wlassistant to become similar advanced. I already looked through the source and I'll start coding, when I get home this weekend. I'll have to see where I can get a USB WLAN adapter for my PC, because the institute wants the iBook back.. :-/
Some features I'd like to implement are: WPA support / integration with wpa_supplicant, better permission handling (Mac OS just asks for the admin password, when the user needs more permissions, Linux applications unfortunately often just don't work or just say, that they couldn't open a device, etc.) and maybe a tray-icon (I don't know how difficult it is to implement this).

I already coded some apps (mostly Wind**s based unfortunately) on my own and tried to contribute to Wine (the wind**s implementation for Linux). I didn't get that far, however.. my one and only patch was very small :-/ I've always tried to switch to Linux as my main development platform, but until now I couldn't make it. Well, maybe I *can* now. :-) My main programming languages are C++, Pascal and PHP (usually using a nice mixture of all three). I'm always trying to learn something new however. I also participate in the so called demoscene, where I'm known as nethead.

I'm finished with school now and I'm going to study Computer Science and Sinology (Chinese language and culture) at the university of Heidelberg, Germany. ''Zai jian.''
