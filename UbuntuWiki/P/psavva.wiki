My name is Panayiotis Savva, and live in Nicosia, Cyprus.
I have been using ubuntu since 5.04 and have tried helping whenever I can on the ubuntuforums and distributed over 100 copies of Ubuntu to colleges and friends. There's nothing I like to do more than actively taking part in the Ubuntu Community and knowing that my input actually makes a difference in shaping Ubuntu's future. I also enjoy music, dancing, socializing and solving puzzles.
