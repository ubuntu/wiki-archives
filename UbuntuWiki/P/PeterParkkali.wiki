=== About me ===
email:  peter . parkkali <> iki . fi

IRC: pfp (Freenode and IRCNet)

MSN: pfpFFF <> hotmail.com

Location: <nowiki>[[http://www.hel.fi/wps/portal/Helsinki_en/?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/en/Helsinki/|Helsinki]]</nowiki>, Finland

I've been a part-time Linux admin from 2000, mostly working on Debian servers. I'm also a CS student at <nowiki>[[http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/|Helsinki University]]</nowiki> ... or enrolled at least; soon I'll find the time to finish some courses too :P

=== So? ===

I've done some minor updates to <nowiki>[[DVDRippingandEncoding]]</nowiki>, SkypeHowto and RestrictedFormats. I'll be testing Dapper on the IBM T23 laptop soon.
