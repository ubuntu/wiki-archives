__TOC__

My name is Paweł T. Jochym, and I am a physicist and long time linux, debian and ubuntu user (starting from kernel 0.9 times and slackware). 
I run some 30-40 (it is difficult to count the exact number) linux desktops and servers. I have and maintain for friends and coworkers several laptops:

* IBM/Lenovo ThinkPad A30, A31, Z60
* Asus M68Ne, A6Rp

I have 10+ years of system administration experience. I also run a small ISP/Hosting company.
