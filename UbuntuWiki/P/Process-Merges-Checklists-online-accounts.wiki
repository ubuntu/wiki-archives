__TOC__

This documents the expections that the project has on what both submitters
and reviewers should ensure that they've done for a merge into the project.

=== Submitter's checklist ===

* Ensure that the coding style is consistent with the project.
* Ensure that non-obvious code has comments explaining it.
* Ensure the project compiles and the test suite executes without error.
* Describe how the feature was tested.

=== Reviewer's checklist ===

* Did the Jenkins build compile and run unit tests successfully?
* Are there appropriate tests to cover any new functionality?
* If this MR affects application requesting access to accounts:
** Run test case: ubuntu-system-settings-online-accounts/access-existing

=== Lander's checklist ===
* Any non trivial change to the code should be manually tested, by either:
** Run test case: <nowiki>[[Process-Merges-TestPlan-ubuntu-system-settings-online-accounts|ubuntu-system-settings-online-accounts-account-create]]</nowiki>
** Run test case: <nowiki>[[Process-Merges-TestPlan-gnome-control-center-signon|gnome-control-center-signon-account-create]]</nowiki>
