__TOC__

I have a orange spv-c500 running windows mobile 2003 second edition, and currently i maintain a windows installed laptop next to my desktop to be able to sync my contacts and calendar. I would like to do this on my desktop, but installing a package for this is a difficult task. (Raki seems to be able to do it, but just not for me)

Phone syncing is really needed for business users. I use (and carry) a second laptop (old iBook) so I can sync my phone (Nokia 3650) to our web calendars and contacts. -- McLogic
