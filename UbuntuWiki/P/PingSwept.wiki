Email: 
I just recently (June 2006) got Dapper Final working on my Sharp MP30. It was actually an upgrade from Breezy, which had been updated from Hoary.

I had to do two tricky things to get X to work:

1. apt-get install tpconfig

In Hoary and Breezy, the touchpad used the synaptic module, but that module is deprecated in Dapper. The replacement is tpconfig. I installed it, ran tpconfig from the command line, and removed all references to Synaptic from xorg.conf.

2. Tweak xorg.conf. I commented out everything that looked unnecessary from xorg.conf. I also deleted a bunch of crap about Wacom tablets that was erroneously autodetected. Here's what I was left with:
