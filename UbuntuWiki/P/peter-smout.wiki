Hi and welcome to My first ever Wiki! I am a home Ubuntu user since 2008 and have come to understand far more about computers in that relativley short periord of time than I did throught my formative years on prepriortry software.

I Live in Southampton (UK) and although I do not work with computers for a living, I do have daily contact with systems in my working life and I am amazed more people do not know that there are alternatives out there.

The reason I have finally got around to writing this Wiki is because I have come accross this: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lubuntu/CommunicationsTeam/WOWLubuntu/StartUbuntu#Start_Ubuntu_Members  : I see this project as the ideal opertunity for me to 'Get Involved' as i feel strongly that the potential savings to be made when Microsoft stop supporting XP in 2014 are huge and if we all band together we can get the word out there!
