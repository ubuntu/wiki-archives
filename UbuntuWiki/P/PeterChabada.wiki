=== Peter Chabada ===

I started using GNU/Linux in 1999. First I used it besides using another operating system but later I realized that using only GNU/Linux is enough and other operating system is not necessary for me. In present I'm using Ubuntu Linux distribution because I don't need to spend time to tweak it to be usable. It just works out of the box for me.

Recently I'm trying to help community by <nowiki>[[http://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/dapper/+lang/sk|translating]]</nowiki> some applications, <nowiki>[[http://launchpad.net/malone|bugreporting]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[http://wiki.ubuntu.com/IdeaPool|suggesting new ideas]]</nowiki> and promoting free software to my friends and colleagues.

I'm leader of <nowiki>[[http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SlovakTeam|Ubuntu Slovak Translators]]</nowiki> team and I'm also preparing <nowiki>[[http://chabada.sk/packages/|few packages]]</nowiki> that are missing in Ubuntu repositories, mainly <nowiki>[[http://chabada.sk/packages/deb/spell/|Slovak spellckekers]]</nowiki>.

If you wish to <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/community/participate|help with anything]]</nowiki>, you are welcome.
