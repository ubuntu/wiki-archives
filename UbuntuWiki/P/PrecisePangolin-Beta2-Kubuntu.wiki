=== New from Kubuntu ===

LTS is stable for the long term so we have concentrated on stability rather than new features in the default install.

==== Muon Suite 1.3 ====

The Muon Suite has been updated to version 1.3. The Muon Suite is now more robust and faster than ever. The Muon Update Manager has received a facelift, making keeping your computer up-to-date a snap.

<nowiki>[[attachment:updater.png|<nowiki>[[File:updater-wee.png]]</nowiki></nowiki>]]

For the power user who wants to control the details of his or her updates, the Muon Package Manager is still available to handle all your update needs, giving you full control. Additionally, the Muon Package Manager now gives you more explicit notification of what extra dependencies will be installed when you mark packages for installation.

==== Oxygen-GTK 3 Theme ====

Many GTK apps are now written with GTK 3.  We have packaged the theme to neatly integrate with KDE's Oxygen.
