notes area for non-pae 32 bit 3.13 building

=== The Initial Build ===

The build machine will have to be reinstalled periodically, so here is the 'from deleted' to alive steps so that I do not forget them!

==== Use the release ISO and do a clean install with it. ====

===== Once the network is running directly, I use ssh. =====

Feel to not install ssh-server part, but it does make doing things like scp much easier.

* sudo -i
* apt-get update 
* apt-get install openssh-server
* apt-get install build-essential checkinstall
* apt-get libncurses5-dev libncurses5
* exit
* mkdir /lubuntu/src
* wget https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/trusty/+source/linux/3.13.0-8.27/+files/linux_3.13.0.orig.tar.gz

=== The Kernel ===

Why does a local build produce such enormous packages?
Our build includes CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO in order to produce linux-debug-image packages. We then manually strip the modules after build.

If you re-use our config for your own build, your best bet is to change this line in the config:

CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO=y
To this:

* 2 cd /home/lubuntu/src
* 2a rm -rf ./linux-3.13
* 2b rm -rf *deb
* 2c tar -xf linux_3.13.0.orig.tar.gz
* 3 cp /boot/config-3.13 <old one> from the VM desktop onto /home/lubuntu/src/linux-3.13/.config 
* 4 make the edits discussed above
* 5 cd ~src/linux-3.13
* 6 make oldconfig (pull in the revised file)
* 7 make menuconfig (add this to new one we're building)
* 8 you will see this screen 
{{http://www.larmeir.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/kernel21.png}}

* 9 go down with the arrow keys until "Processor type and features" is highlighted as in the picture
* 10 On that second page, again use the arrow keys to scroll down until you find the High Memory Support (64GB) as in this picture - 
{{http://www.larmeir.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/kernel3.png}}

 -- it is half way down the second page of options -- Choose the 4gb option rather then the 64 GB option -

* 11 hit enter
* 12 save your edit and then issue make -j3 deb-pkg LOCALVERSION=-non-pae 

That will provide the header, firmware and image .deb files that are needed to install said kernel.
