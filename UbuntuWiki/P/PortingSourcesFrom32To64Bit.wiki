== Porting Sourcecode from 32 to 64 bit ==

During the work on the [CxxLibraryList CXX Transition] I found out some nasty things about the difference between 32bit and 64bit architectures.

After googling around, I found some documents which can help you to port applications and or libraries (or not).
If you have also some good documents for porting apps/libs from one arch to another arch, please put those documents here (link it):
