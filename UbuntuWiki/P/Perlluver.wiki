__TOC__

I have been using Ubuntu since 7.10 beta, and have tried Slackware, Mandriva, OpenSuse, Fedora, and Arch.  But I always come back to trusty Ubuntu, now I am using 8.04.  I love the forums, and the help of all the people.  I hope that I can give back as much as the others.  My name is Brandon Plaufcan.  Yeah try to say that one, I am from New Castle, Pennsylvania.  And I am 25 years old.
