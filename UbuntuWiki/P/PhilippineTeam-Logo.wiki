== History ==

Even as an approved LoCo, the Philippines Team members decided there's still a need solidify our identity. The need for a Team Logo was brought up.

== Request for Logo Approval ==

The request for approval email was sent the first week of December 2007 and we got favorable response on the 18th of December.

Hi Dax,

Thanks for contacting us.

We have absolutely no problem with the logo you request and you have permission to use it.

Thank you for your support of Ubuntu :)

Kind regards
Michelle
