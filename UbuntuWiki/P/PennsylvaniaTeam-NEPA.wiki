__TOC__

== Getting Organized ==
This subteam is meant to cover the Lehigh Valley and Pocono regions, as well as the rest of Northeastern Pennsylvania.

We have members of the LoCo scattered throughout the region, and our first event was the <nowiki>[[http://lvsoftwarefreedom.org/|Lehigh Valley Software Freedom Day 2007]]</nowiki>.

Please check <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=474745|this forum thread]]</nowiki> and reply to indicate where you are in the region, and what you'd be interested in doing.
