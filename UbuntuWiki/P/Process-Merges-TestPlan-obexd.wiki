=== Test dependencies ===

This test plan should be executed from the command line tools available in the obexd package.

For the test dependencies:
# Make it writable: ''$ phablet-config writable-image''
# Install dependencies: ''$ sudo apt-get install python-gobject python-dbus python''

=== Specific Detailed Tests ===

Test 1 - Receiving files:
# Start the simple-agent (as phablet user): ''$ /usr/share/doc/obexd-server/examples/simple-agent''
# Open system-settings, go into the bluetooth page, so other devices are able to find the test device
# From another phone (e.g. android or ubuntu), try sending a file via OBEX (I used Astro File Manager in Android)
# Pair the connection from the other device
# Accept the connection at the test device: ''Authorize (/test/agent, XX:FA:12:10:DA:B5, IMG.jpg) Y/n''
# Enter a path for the transfered file: ''Full filename (including path): /tmp/foo.jpg''
# Open the file and check for the content

Test 2 - Sending files:
# Find out the bluetooth address for the target device (''$ hcitool scan'')
# Initiate the file transfer from the test device (as phablet user): ''$ /usr/share/doc/obexd-client/examples/send-files XX:FA:12:10:DA:B5 /tmp/foo.jpg''
# Accept the connection and the file on the other device
# Open the file and check for the content

Test 3 - Bluetooth Phone Book Access Profile (PBAP)
# Make sure you have valid contacts in your address book
# Connect with a compatible carkit that uses BT PBAP or IrMC (e.g. cars with bluetooth support)
# See if the target device is able to receive the contacts available in your address book

Test 4 - Multimedia folders exported via OBEX:
# Connect to the device using your Ubuntu host machine
# Go to the bluetooth panel (host), and click in 'Browse Files'
# Nautilus should open up with a folder containing the following directories: Documents, Downloads, Music, Pictures and Videos
# You should be able to copy and remove files from such folders, just like MTP
