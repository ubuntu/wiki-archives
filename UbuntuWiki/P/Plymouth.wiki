Plymouth is the application which provides the graphical "splash" screen when booting and shutting down an Ubuntu system.

Note that on Ubuntu, Plymouth is considered to be the "owner" of the console device (`/dev/console`) so no application should attempt to modify terminal attributes for this device at boot or shutdown.

== Quick Facts ==

Plymouth:

* Uses KMS (Kernel Mode Setting) (where possible) and the framebuffer to set the screen resolution.
* Comprises 3 components:
** A daemon (server) process called `plymouthd`<<BR>>
     The daemon is responsible for the graphical display, animation and logging.
** A client application called `plymouth`<<BR>>
     The client sends commands to the daemon
** A library `libply.so` to allow applications to be written to talk to the daemon<<BR>>
     (The `plymouth` command is linked to `libply.so` for this reason).
* Supports themes.
* Is scriptable (see package `plymouth-theme-script`)
* Runs at system startup and system shutdown:
** Boot
*** `plymouthd` is generally started in the initramfs<<BR>>
       (see file `/usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/init-top/plymouth`)
*** `plymouthd` is stopped at the point the Display Manager is starting<<BR>>
       (see Upstart job configuration file file `/etc/init/plymouth-stop.conf`).
** Shutdown
*** `plymouthd` is started by Upstart<<BR>>
       (see Upstart job configuration file file `/etc/init/plymouth.conf`).

* Writes a log to `/var/log/boot.log`.

== Options ==

=== Daemon ===

plymouthd runs in one of four modes which are set by specifing the appropriate command-line option:

* `--mode=boot`
* `--mode=shutdown`
* `--mode=suspend`
* `--mode=resume`

This allows Plymouth to display potentially different content based on whether the system is starting or stopping.

== Startup ==

The `plymouthd` daemon attempts to read the following files at startup (the first file it finds takes precedence over any other):

* General configuration
** `/etc/plymouth/plymouthd.conf` (unused on Ubuntu)
** `/lib/plymouth/plymouthd.defaults` (unused on Ubuntu)
* Splash Theme
** `/lib/plymouth/themes/default.plymouth`

=== Splash Theme ===

Contents of `/lib/plymouth/themes/default.plymouth`:

<pre>
  [Plymouth Theme]
  Name=Ubuntu Logo
  Description=A theme that features a blank background with a logo.
  ModuleName=script

  [script]
  ImageDir=/lib/plymouth/themes/ubuntu-logo
  ScriptFile=/lib/plymouth/themes/ubuntu-logo/ubuntu-logo.script
</pre>

This tells `plymouthd` to use the "`script`" splash plugin. This plugin allows the graphical splash experience to be scripted using Plymouths own scripting language (hence the name).

The "`script`" splash plugin exists as `/lib/plymouth/script.so` (source code: `src/plugins/splash/script/script.c`)

* "`ImageDir`" tells `plymouthd` which directory contains the images used by the "`Ubuntu Logo`" theme.
* "`ScriptFile`" is the full path to the Plymouth script which creates the splash experience.

== Testing ==

=== Checking Plymouth Can Run in the Initramfs ===

# Add "`break=init`" to the kernel command-line and boot.
# Chroot to the real filesystem:
<pre>
    chroot /root
    </pre>
    Some warning messages will be displayed, but they can be ignored:
    <pre>
    bash: cannot set terminal process group (-1): Inappropriate ioctl for device
    bash: no job control in this shell
    </pre>
1. Start the daemon:
    <pre>
    plymouthd --tty=`tty` --mode=boot --kernel-command-line="quiet splash"
    </pre>
1. Check that the daemon is running:
    <pre>
    plymouth --ping && echo plymouth is running || echo plymouth NOT running
    </pre>
1. Tell the daemon to display the splash screen:
    <pre>
    plymouth show-splash
    </pre>

If this works, to exit the splash screen you'll have to type the following "blind" (and note that backspace won't work, but CONTROL-c will):
<pre>
  plymouth exit
</pre>

To shutdown your system:

1. Remount the disk read-only:
<pre>
    mount -oremount,ro /
    </pre>
1. Power off the system.

Note that "`shutdown -h now` or "`halt`" cannot be used since <nowiki>[[Upstart]]</nowiki> is not running in this scenario.

=== Checking Plymouth Can Run Early in Boot ===

# Add "`init=/bin/sh`" to the kernel command-line and boot.
# A warning message will be displayed, but can be ignored:
    <pre>
    /bin/sh: 0: can't access tty: job control turned off
    </pre>
1. Start the daemon:
    <pre>
    plymouthd --tty=`tty` --mode=boot --kernel-command-line="quiet splash"
    </pre>
1. Check the daemon is running
    <pre>
    plymouth --ping && echo plymouth is running || echo plymouth NOT running
    </pre>
1. Tell the daemon to display the splash screen:
    <pre>
    plymouth show-splash
    </pre>

If this works, to exit the splash screen you'll have to type the following "blind" (and not that backspace won't work, but CONTROL-c will):
<pre>
  plymouth exit
</pre>

To shutdown your system:

1. Flush any pending data:
<pre>
    sync;sync;sync
    </pre>
1. Remount disk read-only:
    <pre>
    mount -oremount,ro /
    </pre>
1. Power off the system.

Note that "`shutdown -h now` or "`halt`" cannot be used since <nowiki>[[Upstart]]</nowiki> is not running in this scenario.

=== Running Plymouth "post-boot" ===

You can experiment with Plymouth after your system has booted. To start the Plymouth daemon:

# Boot system and login as usual
# {i} [RECOMMENDED] Install `plymouth-x11` package (allows you to see the boot screen in an X11 window)
    `sudo apt-get install plymouth-x11`
# Start a terminal (such as `gnome-terminal`)
# Start the Plymouth daemon by running the following:
   <code>sudo plymouthd --debug --tty=`tty` --no-daemon</code>

Plymouth is now running, so we can have some fun:

* To check if Plymouth really ''is'' running:<<BR>>
   `sudo plymouth --ping && echo plymouth is running || echo plymouth NOT running`
* To show a message on our "boot" screen
## Start another `gnome-terminal` terminal/tab
## Run the following to show the Plymouth window:<<BR>>
      `sudo plymouth show-splash`
1. Display a message
      `sudo plymouth message --text="hello world"`
* A slightly more useful example
1. Show the splash screen
      `sudo plymouth show-splash`
1. Stop the graphical progress indicator
      `sudo plymouth pause-progress`
1. Display a message
      `sudo plymouth message --text="pausing boot - press 'c' or space bar to continue"`
1. Wait for the user to type either 'c', 'C' or space (no return required)
      `sudo plymouth watch-keystroke --keys="cC " --command="tee /tmp/c_key_pressed"`
1. Change the on-screen message
      `sudo plymouth message --text="resuming boot"`
1. Resume the graphical progress indicator
      `sudo plymouth unpause-progress`

Note that when you run the "`show-splash`" command, ''two'' windows pop up. This is because Plymouth simulates a dual-monitor setup.

To stop the Plymouth daemon:

 `sudo plymouth --quit`

== Debugging ==

/!\ This section is for advanced users only.

=== Toggling to Traditional Text-based Boot ===

If you want to see the text-based boot messages (which use the Plymouth "`details`" plugin, press the `ESCAPE` key at any point when Plymouth is running. Note that the `ESCAPE` key acts as a toggle, so you can keep switching between graphical and text mode as required.

To have the boot start in "text mode" as early as possible, remove "`splash`" from the kernel command-line in grub.

To make the change permanent, update `/etc/default/grub` and run "`sudo update-grub`".

<pre> warning
Updating the grub configuration manually is a potentially dangerous operation and can result in a machine that fails to boot without intervention. Do not attempt it unless you understand exactly what you are doing.
</pre>

=== Enabling Debugging ===

You can set Plymouth to overlay internal debug messages (which will also be logged to a file) by adding the following command-line option to grub:

  `plymouth:debug`

For example, if you are running Ubuntu Natty (11.04) or Oneiric (11.10):

# Power on system.
# Hold down the `CONTROL` key until the Grub boot menu appears.
# Type "`e`" to edit the default kernel command-line.
# Use the arrow keys to go to the end of the line which starts "`linux /boot/vmlinuz ...`".
# Add a space character, followed by "`plymouth:debug`".
 <<BR>>Notes:
** If you're interested in the overall boot, you may wish to remove the "`quiet`" keyword too)
# Type `CONTROL+x` to boot
# Once the system has booted, you can view all the Plymouth debug output in file `var/log/plymouth-debug.log`.

For older releases such as Maverick (10.10), hold down the `SHIFT` key rather than the `CONTROL` key to access the grub boot menu.

Notes:

* If you are using the live CD, the process is slightly different:
## Power on system
## Hold down the SHIFT key until ISOLINUX "boot:" prompt appears
## Type, "`live plymouth:debug`"

== Plymouth Logs ==

Plymouth will log all output sent to the console to a file. By default, the data is logged to file `/var/log/boot.log`. If Plymouth is running in debug mode, debug messages are logged to `/var/log/plymouth-debug.log`.

Note that `plymouthd` buffers all messages until told that the disk partition on which the logs are to be written (in other words the partition containing `/var/log/`) is writeable.

The Upstart job `/etc/init/plymouth-log.conf` is used to accomplish this by calling:

<pre>
  plymouth update-root-fs --read-write
</pre>
== Tips ==

* Take care if you add "`console=`" options to your kernel command line since `plymouthd` will honour those over its own
   "`--tty=TTY`" option!

== Additional ==

=== "plymouth ask-question" ===

Used to prompt the user for an answer, echoing the answer text as it is typed. The answer is by default echoed to stdout to allow it to be piped to another command which expects to read the password on its stdin. Example:

<pre>
  plymouth ask-question --prompt "what is your name? " |\
    command-to-process-answer --read-from-stdin
</pre>

Similar functionality is provided by a combination of "`plymouth message`" and "`plymouth watch-keystroke`".

=== "plymouth ask-for-password" ===

Used to prompt the user for a password securely (password text is not echoed). The password the user enters is by default echoed to stdout to allow it to be piped to another command which expects to read the password on its stdin. Example:

<pre>
  plymouth ask-for-password --prompt "specify password: " |\
    command-to-read-password-and-do-secret-things --read-from-stdin
</pre>

=== Special FSCK messages ===

The Ubuntu Plymouth theme supports a "special" message that allows mountall to display fsck progress messages ("fsck is 20% complete"). You can make use of this functionality by using a special message format:

<pre>
  sudo plymouth --update=fsck:sda1:27
</pre>

This will display a message like:

<pre>
  Checking disk 1 of 1 (27% complete)
</pre>
