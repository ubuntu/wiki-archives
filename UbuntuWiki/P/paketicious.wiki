== Paketicious ==

Paketicious is a  project that aims to create a knowledge base of interesting packages for each knowledge area. It has a web based interface written in Django to ensure ease of use.

This project has been created for a Django course in University of La Laguna (ULL). As many other universities ULL has its own distro based in KUbuntu. One of the key proposed value-add are meta-packages providing interesting packages for every knowledge-area. However we don't know a Free Software professor in every area therefore we have just some meta-packages. We are trying to create a collaborative tool which can manage the knowledge of the community and even generate the meta-packages within the web interface.
