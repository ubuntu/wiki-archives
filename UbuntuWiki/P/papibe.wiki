== About Me ==
After a  several years being far away from Linux and Open Source, I started researching for a modern Linux distribution. I discovered Debian and started playing with it. Although very nice, the moment that I tried Ubuntu, I was sold. Today I'm almost use exclusively Ubuntu (except for some occasional and casual Windows gaming).

==== Professionally ====

I am a B.S. in Computer Science working now as a tech and business consultant. I started early in my career as a system administrator of several Unix-ish servers (SunOS, Ultrix and AIX). I was very lucky to form part of the team that introduce Internet to Chile. I worked as the CL domain manager for a couple of years. 

Later, I did a big switch and started developing workflow applications, project manager and application design. For many years I worked as a consultant doing re-engineering, and design and mobilization of new practices around new technologies.

==== Music ====

I am a amateur musician. I play electric guitar, and I've been part of several bands. At one point of my life, I decided to take my hobby seriously, quit my job, and play music exclusively for 2 years. I joined a band, and then formed a my own. As a result of that, I recorded a couple of independent albums.

==== Other ====

I'm originally from Chile, but I've moved quite a lot.  I lived in Mexico for 12 years. I'm currently living in Dallas, TX.  My avatar is, indeed, a picture of my dog, Bingo.

== Ubuntu Participation ==

==== Forums ====

I joined the forums more that 3 years ago, and I consider myself a pretty active forumer. I've never had any infraction or warning.

I enjoy sharing experiences and knowledge about Open Source and Linux. When I decide to help another user, I always make the effort  to  “understand”  his/her concerns as much as possible before writing a reply.

When I think I got it, I try to be helpful by taking my time and writing a replay that not only can be understood, but be useful for other people browsing the forums.  Also, I reckon sometimes is difficult to express your ideas in a helping mood using written text,  so I always try to be polite. 

I think Ubuntu's greatest asset is its community.  However, the forum's civility is on a league of its own.  I admire how it is kept and promote by the admins and moderators.

==== Lauchpad ====

As a wanted to participate a little more deep I created my Launchpad account to both report those little bugs that I encountered. Not as much as the forums, but I keep an active participation there too.

I have signed the Ubuntu Code of Conduct.

=== Team Memberships ===
None yet, but I'm hoping to became an Ubuntu Member.

=== Future Plans & Projects ===
I have in mind a few guides and howtos for the forums:

{*} A Series of basic guides on how to access your home computer/files from the Internet:

    {*} Basics of openssh-server and port forwarding.

    {*} ssh/sftp Windows and linux clients.

{*} How to set up and use transmission-daemon.
