My name is Petr Mensik, I am advanced linux user. I most time use Debian, on my laptop i have Ubuntu Hardy installed.

My laptop is Sony Vaio, brand <nowiki>[[LaptopTestingTeam-SonyVaioVGN-FZ210CE|VGN-FZ210CE]]</nowiki>. There are problems about some functions with vaio. Most problems is about backlight control and special keys. I made <nowiki>[[http://www.pihhan.info/sony | page about hotkeys setup]]</nowiki>, but it does not solve backlight control.
