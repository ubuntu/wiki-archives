=== About Me ===

I am a software engineer working on the development and delivery of <nowiki>[[https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com|Ubuntu cloud images]]</nowiki> for download and on major cloud platforms. I work on the Canonical Public Cloud team to deliver Ubuntu to all the major public clouds. I have been Ubuntu cloud image release shepherd for many of the recent releases, including Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. 

I have been an Ubuntu desktop and server user <nowiki>[[https://pre2015.philroche.net/archives/osx-and-ubuntu-dual-boot/|since at least 2005]]</nowiki> and an Ubuntu cloud user <nowiki>[[https://pre2015.philroche.net/archives/simple-django-install-on-amazon-ec2/|since at least 2010]]</nowiki>.

Phil has worked on many embargoed CVE releases affecting Ubuntu Cloud Images, LXD, MAAS images. Without his work, there would be a lot less chance for images to be ready and published when the named vulnerabilities hit the news. He is a great advocate of Ubuntu. I would recommend granting phil Ubuntu Membership status and/or Ubuntu Contributing Developer (without upload rights). -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:xnox]]</nowiki> 
I would recommend granting Phil Ubuntu Membership and/or Ubuntu Contributing Developer status. He had been a solid and consistent contributor to, and advocate for, Ubuntu.  Phil has been critical in developing and maintaining the Ubuntu experience in public clouds both in the images themselves and also in the user tools to make them easier to find and use.  I would echo xnox's statements about Phil's tireless efforts related to CVEs well; he cares deeply about providing Ubuntu users with the most secure Ubuntu experience from the moment they launch. -- @-- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:rcj]]</nowiki> @

I have cooperated with Phil on multiple occasions and working with him was always a pleasure - he's been our go-to cloud image coordinator during many Ubuntu releases. He's in the heart of the Ubuntu cloud development and delivery, critical to Ubuntu's success in the clouds. I think Phil totally deserves to be an Ubuntu Member and/or Ubuntu Contributing Developer. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:sil2100]]</nowiki>
