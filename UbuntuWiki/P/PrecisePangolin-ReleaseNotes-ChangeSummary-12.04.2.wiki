__TOC__


This is a brief summary of bugs fixed between Ubuntu 12.04.1 and 12.04.2.  '''This summary covers only changes to packages in ''__main__'' and ''__restricted__'', which account for all packages in the officially-supported CD images; there are further changes to various packages in ''universe'' and ''multiverse''.'''  Some of these fixes were by Ubuntu developers directly, while others were by upstream developers and backported to Ubuntu.  For full details, see the individual package changelogs.

In addition to the bugs listed below, this update includes all security updates from the <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/precise|Ubuntu Security Notice list]]</nowiki> affecting Ubuntu 12.04 LTS that were released up to and including February 5, 2013.  The last update included was USN-1681-4 (Firefox regression).

=== Installation bug fixes ===

Updated CD images are provided with this release, including fixes for some installation bugs.  (Many installation problems are hardware-specific; for those, see "Hardware support bugs" below.)

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| busybox
| Bug:1040900
| Increase the maximum supported log line length from 256 to 512 bytes
|-
| casper
| Bug:984276
| Remove code generating symlink for /usr/sbin/update-initramfs to /usr/share/casper/casper-update-initramfs as the diversion and symlinking is done in the initramfs and that code was only useful when the shim was first introduced
|-
| debian-installer
| Bug:1040393
| Make omap/omap4 netboot VFAT partitions the same size as the ones used for CD-like media
|-
| debian-installer

|-
| livecd-rootfs
| Bug:1097039
| Use safer code for kernel handling that doesn't cause failures under 'set -o pipefail' in ubuntu-defaults-image
|-
| livecd-rootfs
| Bug:1098512
| Build Ubuntu, Edubuntu, and Mythbuntu images with kernel and X enablement stacks on amd64 and i386.  Note that this requires switching those images to be built largely using metapackages rather than tasks
|-
| ltsp
| Bug:1122525
| Fix support for LTS backport kernels.  This means LTSP will install the lts-quantal kernels if no other alternatives are present on the media.  It will still favor -generic-pae and -generic over any backport kernel to avoid moving existing users to a new kernel on upgrades
|-
| ltsp
| Bug:1124029
| Make ltsp-client-builder ensure that /run/resolvconf exists in the target, to avoid some installations failing when trying to touch /etc/resolv.conf
|-
| network-manager
| Bug:995165
| Make sure that "iface X inet6" entries added by d-i also get commented out if set up for dhcp or auto -- this follows what is already done for IPv4, where such devices should be handled by Network``Manager.  This fixes issues where people installing using d-i and where IPv6 autoconfiguration is available would get their interfaces ignored by Network``Manager when installing desktop

=== Kernel and Hardware support updates ===

Considerable work has been done in Ubuntu 12.04.2 on improving support for many specific items of hardware.  In particular, we have added support for UEFI Secure Boot, and backported the kernel and X.org stacks from Ubuntu 12.10; these "enablement stacks" are used by default on new installs and are optional on upgrade.

Note that upstream commits to stable kernel releases are listed separately below.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| bcmwl
| Bug:994255
| Add support for Linux kernels up to 3.5
|-
| bcmwl
| Bug:1020059
| Always apply all dkms patches
|-
| bcmwl
| Bug:1065827
| Mirror the actions of the installed modprobe.d files, i.e. rmmod the b43 driver and try to modprobe wl, so that this package works right after installation
|-
| bcmwl
| Bug:1089943
| Drop parsing of src/src/wl/sys/wl_linux.c, as the current upstream version dropped all useful vendor matches in its pci_device_id struct and now has a broken modalias.  Keep a static debian/bcmwl-kernel-source.modaliases instead which matches on any Broadcom network device (vendor 14E4 class 02 subclass 80).  This brings back a proper "Modaliases:" package header

|-
| apport
| Bug:1084296
| Refresh the .upload stamps if a previous version of the report was already uploaded, but another instance of the problem happened since then
|-
| apport
| Bug:1039220

| gdb
| Bug:1036834
| Added Multi-Arch: allowed field to gdb
|-
| grub2
| Bug:901600
| Read /etc/default/grub.d/*.cfg after /etc/default/grub
|-
| isc-dhcp
| Bug:974284
| Update onetry_retry_after_initial_success to disable the onetry variable early enough to actually prevent dhclient from exiting
|-
| isc-dhcp
| Bug:1045986
| debian/dhclient-script.linux: Explicitly set the PATH to that of ENV_SUPATH in /etc/login.defs and unset various other variables.  We need to do this so /sbin/dhclient cannot abuse the environment to escape App``Armor confinement via this script
|-
| lsb
| Bug:938869
| lsb_release: Add -Es to #! line for Python so that it will ignore the $PYTHON* environment variables, and not add the user's site directory to sys.path

| make-dfsg
| Bug:1076426
| Backport a third party patch (from Webkit) to work around argument length limitations in the shell when specifying many files at once
|-
| man-db
| Bug:1001189
| Avoid fatal errors when opening a 64-bit GDBM database from a 32-bit process
|-
| mountall
| Bug:1099349
| Ensure callbacks are called directly when running with --no-events, otherwise the "event" handling of the non-events never finishes and mountall hangs
|-
| mountall
| Bug:1041377
| Adjust parsing of options so mountall doesn't strip options that are substrings of these strings (showthrough, optional, bootwait, nobootwait or timeout).  This fixes the issue where timeo was getting stripped from nfs mounts
|-
| nfs-utils
| Bug:794112
| Add "-e" (ticket expiry is error) option to rpc.gssd to prevent hangs due to EKEYEXPIRED error from kernel on ticket expiry
|-
| openssl
| Bug:973741
| Apply complete and more recent changeset, which fixes original issue on Intel CPUs and fixes FTBFS on non-x86 architectures
|-
| openssl
| Bug:973741
| Avoid segfault on legacy Intel CPUs by using correct cypher

|-
| qemu-kvm
| Bug:997978
| Fix race condition in virtio code on multicore systems
|-
| rpcbind
| Bug:1007293
| debian/rpcbind.portmap-wait.upstart: export ON_BOOT=y when starting portmap from here; since portmap and statd will only race to start on boot, and not when started from a maintainer script, we can assume that the only time this 'start' command has any effect is at boot time, so it's always correct to say ON_BOOT=y here.  This fixes a problem with racy startup of portmap causing other services that depend on portmap to start too early
|-
| sshfs-fuse
| Bug:1017870
| Return the correct X_OK access for sshfs mounts
|-
| trousers
| Bug:959795
| Reload udev rules to reload new users and groups

| tzdata
| Bug:1050404
| Re-upload to precise.  The openjdk-7 7u7-2.3.2-1ubuntu0.12.04.1 upload removed the /usr/share/javazi directory.  openjdk-7 7u7-2.3.2a-0ubuntu0.12.04.1 now depends on this version of the package to fore a reinstallation
|-
| upstart
| Bug:980917
| Cherry-pick newer test code to fix test failure seen on ARM
