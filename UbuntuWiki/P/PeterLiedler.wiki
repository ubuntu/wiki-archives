=== About Me ===

I am a linux user since general uprising of xp. By then I had no choice than to switch to freedom.

Learning the basics with suse, i finally switched to debian and the debian based distro (k)ubuntu. Here life is simple. Still there are bugs, but they can be dealt with. Most of the things, features and apps my friends and I use simply work. And if they don't we make them work.

Besides my family and a full-time-job I help friends switch to linux, write some small programs (meanwhile in python) and keep me up to date scanning forums.
