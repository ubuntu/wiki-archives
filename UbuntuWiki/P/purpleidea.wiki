i:
- use my dell inspiron 9400 with linux.
- wish i had time to learn how to do all the asterisk stuff.
- do lots of playing around writing pretty database things.

specs:
<<BR>>* Intel Core Duo Processor T2500 (2Ghz/667MHz FSB)
<<BR>>* 17 inch UltraSharp Wide Screen UXGA Display with TrueLife (1920x1200)
<<BR>>* 1GB Shared Dual Channel DDR2 SDRAM @ 667MHz

<<BR>>* 80 WHr 9-cell Lithium Ion Battery (not one of the ones that go on fire)
<<BR>>* Intel PRO/Wireless 3945 802.11a/g Mini Card (although I thought it can do "b" too)
<<BR>>* Dell Wireless 350 Bluetooth Internal (2.0 + Enhanced Data Rate)
<<BR>>+ all that other stuff that happens to be there, like firewire, the tiny keyboard, a memory card reader i will likely almost never use, the stroke pad, and a bunch of weird "media buttons" on the front.
<<BR>>+ oh actually plus the "MediaDirect" button next to the power button which boots a "special" partition to just play like "media and stuff" w/o loading the whole O/S. (but i deleted the partition so it just acts like a backup power button only with less  hardware features)
