__TOC__

I have been dabbling with Linux since 1997... now the word here is dabbling as in playing, so I know a bit more then people that have never touched it... and I used to run a personal Linux server in 2001.

Some of my working includes :
 - doing install for customer, with basic configuration of workstation
 - basic server configuration (mostly installation and finetuning)

well I'm trying to bug my boss (or push) for a Linux certification (hmmmmm... LPIC1 with UBUNTU) but I guess that's a work in progress... but with all the explosion of Linux in companies... who knows !!
