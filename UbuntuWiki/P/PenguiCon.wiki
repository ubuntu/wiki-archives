== What is Penguicon? ==

'''To those of you familiar with the Linux and Free/Open Source community:'''
Think of a weekend long Linux Users Group meeting with hundreds of other geeks, which also just happens to have nationally acclaimed guests, a LAN party, its own wireless network, hotel room parties, lots of folks talking about Science Fiction and Fantasy, a place to buy cool t-shirts and buttons and such, amateur singing, anime, a costume contest, and free caffeine and snacks always available.

'''To those of you familiar with Science Fiction conventions:'''
Imagine all the convention features you know and love, with the addition of wireless internet access, computer game tournaments, people who know about online publishing / books on demand / digital art, a programming track involving computing topics and another one focusing on the crossover between Science Fiction and computing. Imagine seeing your favorite creative visionaries meet the innovators who are creating the future you read about in SF.
