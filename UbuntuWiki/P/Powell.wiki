This is my Ubuntu homepage.  I am new to Ubuntu, but trying very hard to learn and to spread the word to others.

It may take a while for me to update the page after today.  Tomorrow I move to a new apartment (still in <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chigasaki|Chigasaki]]</nowiki>) so I will be without internet connection until I can get it reconnected at the new place.

Meanwhile, if you are in Japan (especially in Kanagawa-ken, or Kanto) feel free to drop me an email.  Even if you aren't in Japan I would love to hear from you.

Later...
