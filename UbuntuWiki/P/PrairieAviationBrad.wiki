===== Team Work =====
* ChicagoTeam - Just joined not to long ago and trying to get into things.

* MarketingTeam work - Just joined as well and really haven't had much to offer due to work and all. However I feel this is one of the best places I will be able to contribute to from my previous small background in marketing.

 

=== About Me ===
Well I'm you basic computer geek like a good many of us out there. I love to learn new things and seem to be the one that people come to when they have a question or problem.

Back in the early days I was a avid user of BBS's and actually ran one for awhile. If you don't know what a BBS is then you should look it up, nothing like logging online with a 9600 baud modem and hoping you get one of the few open ports to log into.

When I started doing web design it was with a text editor, I remember doing a simple animated gif that took almost 3 days to complete that I could do now in under 5 minutes. I liked Microsoft in those days and was joyed when Frontpage came out. At one point I actually had a phone number to someone in development at MS and was on a first name basis. I found security holes in other peoples websites, told them and got a few holes fixed. I was thrilled when we got our 1X cd burner but annoyed that I had to use a Mac for it. My how times have changed.

Around 2000 I totally got out of the tech field. MS was getting on my nerves, most people that had recieved a MSCE or whatever cert always seemed to prove they didn't know anything, though there are a few that did know what they were doing.

I had friends show me various Linux distros but I never totally caught the bug. Of course my first real experience with a distro was Slackware, not the most user friendly thing to start someone out in the Linux world, that was back in 1999. Through the years I've tried quite a few distros off and on but have never really embraced one like I have Ubuntu.

While being out of the technical community for a few years, I work with retirement funds now lol, I have decided to jump back into the marketing swing of things. I always loved marketing but never really loved the things I was marketing, with Ubuntu that is different.

Currently I do volunteer work at a local museum and have introduced Ubuntu to the museum. Since we are a non-profit there isn't much money to be spent on some things. When we get donated or new computers in without a OS I convinced the board that open source is the way to go. Now the museum has 10 systems running Edubuntu, 3 Ubuntu's at my house, 2 at a friends, another 3 that I've given to people I know and I'm trying for more.

So that's it, I'm working on becoming a Ubuntu member and trying to get some Linux certs. I'm a member of Ubuntu-Chicago and Ubuntu-Marketing and hope to step up to the plate soon and start contributing to both of them.

=== Contacting Me ===
Any of the contact options listed above will work and you can use them at any time. I'll give as much time as I can to any project presented to me, if I don't feel I have enough knowledge to work on it trust me I'll let you know.

===== Long Term / Community Goals =====
 {*} Get some Linux certs and a Ubuntu certification.
