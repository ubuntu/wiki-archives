=== About Me ===
Hi, I'm Pucho. I live in Orlando Florida and currently attending UCF in computer science. I started using Ubuntu in the summer of 2011, it's the only OS I use and I don't plan on going back to Windows. I am hoping to learn how to develop programs and applications for Ubuntu.

=== Knowledge ===

==== Programming ====
* C
* C++ (not as good as I know C)
* Java
* Python (learning)
* PHP (learning)
* Know the basics of writing a compiler, using tools such as Bison, and Flex.

=== Goals ===
* I would like to join a team and start writing interesting programs and applications.
* I would like to become a powerful programmer in Python.
* Help Linux and Ubuntu to continue to grow as a powerful OS.
