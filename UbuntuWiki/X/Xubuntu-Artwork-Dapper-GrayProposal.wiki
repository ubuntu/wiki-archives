Proposal "Gray" by Luzi:

'''<Warning>'''

Now that the poll is over, updates to my proposals go directly to these pages:

DapperXubuntuLookDesktop

DapperXubuntuLookGdm

DapperXubuntuLookUsplash

This page is not updated anymore.

'''</Warning>'''

== Logo ==
<nowiki>[[File:xubuntu_logo_blue.png]]</nowiki> 

<nowiki>[[attachment:xubuntu_logo_blue.svg|Inkscape Source]]</nowiki>

== Wallpaper ==

<nowiki>[[File:xubuntu-wallpaper.png]]</nowiki>

<nowiki>[[attachment:xubuntu-wallpaper.xcf.gz|XCF Source]]</nowiki>

== Usplash ==

<nowiki>[[File:xubuntu-usplash.png]]</nowiki>

I could not actually test this on my  system. I somehow failed at installing it properly :o( Maybe someone else can try it and tell me if it looks OK? I hope the font colors are OK.

== GDM Theme ==

<nowiki>[[File:xubuntu-gdm.png]]</nowiki>

<nowiki>[[attachment:xubuntu-gdm.xcf.gz|XCF Source]]</nowiki>

I'm just providing the background image at the moment. The theme as a whole, especially the color of the bar, would have to be slightly modified for this to work.
