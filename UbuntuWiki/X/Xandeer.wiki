__TOC__

I'm Alexander Cox(Xandeer) and i've been playing around with computers for a while now. I started using ubuntu in september of 2006 and have been loving since. I have been trying out other OSs since but ubuntu is still my favoutite. I love computers but they don't seem to have much of a liking for me. I live in Albury, NSW, Australia and like chocolate.
