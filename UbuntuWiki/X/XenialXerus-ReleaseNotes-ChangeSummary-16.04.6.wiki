__TOC__


This is a brief summary of bugs fixed between Ubuntu 16.04.5 and 16.04.6.  '''This summary covers only changes to packages in ''__main__'' and ''__restricted__'', which account for all packages in the officially-supported CD images; there are further changes to various packages in ''universe'' and ''multiverse''.'''  Some of these fixes were by Ubuntu developers directly, while others were by upstream developers and backported to Ubuntu.  For full details, see the individual package changelogs.

In addition to the bugs listed below, this update includes all security updates from the <nowiki>[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/releases/ubuntu-16.04-lts/|Ubuntu Security Notice list]]</nowiki> affecting Ubuntu 16.04.5 LTS that were released up to and including February 26, 2019.  The last update included was USN-3866-3 (Ghostscript regression).

=== Installation bug fixes ===

Updated CD images are provided with this release, including fixes for some installation bugs.  (Many installation problems are hardware-specific; for those, see "Hardware support bugs" below.)

|-
| debian-installer
| Bug:1807023

|-
| user-setup
| Bug:1817689

|}

=== Upgrade bug fixes ===

These changes fix upgrade issues, smoothing the way for future upgrades to later releases of Ubuntu.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| update-manager
| Bug:1317164
| Print transaction error and let the user try again applying updates
|-
| update-manager
| Bug:1791931
| Don't ask backend to do package operations aready done. Aptdaemon cancels the transaction when asked to remove packages already removed which results the failure being shown to the user. This is unnecessary as update-manager can just filter the package operations to be done using a fresh cache and decrease the likelyhood of hitting a race condition where packages to be removed are already removed.
|-
| update-manager
| Bug:1072136
| Keep or delete packages after looping over all of them. This prevents the resolver from changing the packages in the loop resulting in not keeping some phased packages back from being upgraded.
|-
| update-manager
| Bug:1795898
| Stop lazy import of InstallBackends. Lazy imports made update-manager crash when an update-manager update changed the backend API and an updated incompatible backend was loaded to the not updated running update-manager process.
|-
| update-manager
| Bug:1790670
| Cancel transaction on exit only when Cancel button is active. Also ignore exception when cancellation fails.
|-
| update-manager
| Bug:1771894
| Make commit()'s last parameter optional for avoiding crash on upgrade
|-
| ubuntu-release-upgrader
| Bug:1797209
| do-release-upgrade: do not run the release upgrade if either not all fully phased updates are installed or a reboot is required due to a libc6 upgrade.
|-
| update-notifier
| Bug:1458204
| Do not notify-reboot-required on linux-image-extra removal
|}

|-

|-
