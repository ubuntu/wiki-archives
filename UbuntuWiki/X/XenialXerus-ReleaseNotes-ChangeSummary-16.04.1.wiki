__TOC__


This is a brief summary of bugs fixed between Ubuntu 16.04 and 16.04.1.  '''This summary covers only changes to packages in ''__main__'' and ''__restricted__'', which account for all packages in the officially-supported CD images; there are further changes to various packages in ''universe'' and ''multiverse''.'''  Some of these fixes were by Ubuntu developers directly, while others were by upstream developers and backported to Ubuntu.  For full details, see the individual package changelogs.

In addition to the bugs listed below, this update includes all security updates from the <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/trusty|Ubuntu Security Notice list]]</nowiki> affecting Ubuntu 16.04 LTS that were released up to and including July 19, 2016.  The last update included was USN-3039-1 (Django vulnerability).

=== Installation bug fixes ===

Updated CD images are provided with this release, including fixes for some installation bugs.  (Many installation problems are hardware-specific; for those, see "Hardware support bugs" below.)

| Revert "enable TasksMax= for all services by default, and set it to 512". Introducing a default limit on number of threads broke a lot of software which regularly needs more, such as MySQL and RabbitMQ, or services that spawn off an indefinite number of subtasks that are not in a scope, like LXC or cron. 512 is way too much for most "simple" services, and it's way too little for the ones mentioned above. Effective (and much stricter) limits should instead be put into units individually. (Closes: #823530, LP: #1578080)
