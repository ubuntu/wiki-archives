* Team Updates
** The Marketing blueprint has been updated with plans for this cycle https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/xubuntu-u-marketing
** bug #1299743 is now Fix Committed status
** bluesabre now has upload rights for the xubuntu packageset
** xubuntu-dev PPAs are growing with an increased number of packages for trusty and utopic - https://launchpad.net/~xubuntu-dev/+archive/ubuntu/xubuntu-staging - https://launchpad.net/~xubuntu-dev/+archive/ubuntu/extras
** Xfce packages are now accepted under the MRE (micro release exceptions).
** xubuntu packageset has been updated with the packages we ship, so uploads should be simpler now
** gstreamer1.0-clutter is the only additional package if we ship parole with a clutter backend
** The "split theme package" bug may subside after the recent QA upload for shimmer-themes but catching duplicates has to be done manually.
** new packages in utopic: xfce4-power-manager, xfwm4
** From overwatch on bugs, there has been a small effort to try to treat design decisions as bugs and patch them away
** Such bugs that have attempted to re-open design decision have been flagged as opinion for now
** xfwm4 tabwin needs small theme updates/tweaks, ochosi has local patches for that already
** Xubuntu 14.04.1 released last week, good job everyone!
** Xfce has made some progress towards new development releases that we will most likely want to pick for 14.10
