=== Detailed specification ===
For a while now, Xchat hasn't been actively developed so I'm proposing we switch to the fork that seems quite active.

Pros:
* Activly Developed.
* Already has more features, such as built-in SASL support.
* In the default repositories.

Cons:
* Have to edit the seed.

Question: Can we set it so that the default channel is #xubuntu for us?

Answer: Not really, not using the same repo as Ubuntu.  It doesn't autojoin you to #ubuntu, it'll only recommend that channel when you connect to Freenode.
