Proposed agenda for the next Xubuntu meeting (Wed, Mar 22 2006 14:00 UTC)

=== Xubuntu Mail Client ===

Xubuntu lacks still of a mail client, the choice was sylpheed-claws-gtk2, but there aren't any news on this front.
Pick between

1) sylpheed-claws-gtk2
2) thunderbird
3) no email client

in the default install.
1) pro: footprint
   con: now in universe, additional security maintenance overhead if in main
2) pro: already in main and supported by the Ubuntu team
   con: footprint
3) pro: no hassle for us
   con: some people may still need a pop3/imap/newsreader installed by default

=== Xubuntu Archive Manager ===

Xarchiver could be integrated in xfce by upstreamers, this is an open discussion on the xfce-devel mail list

=== Xubuntu and Main ===
