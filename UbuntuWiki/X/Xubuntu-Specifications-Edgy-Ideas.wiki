__TOC__

Here's a list of ideas for Xubuntu Edgy. Please do not edit this unless for tidying and organizing, bring ideas up in xubuntu-devel first.

Some of these may be flashed out later to full specifications if necessary.

==== Important Features ====

These are basic features (think Win95) people are requesting and the code has yet to be written.

* New printer configuration (either adding this to xfprint or making gnome-cups-manager gtk-only)
* Browse Windows network (Thunar)
* Trash support (Thunar)
* Floppy support (Thunar)
* Sort out Audio/Video player situation (gxine looks better that xfmedia at this point) (I would suggest seperate clients for audio and video: something like Listen or Exaile for audio, and gxine/xine for video)
* Update-notifier to be included by default

:Note: samba, trash, floppy may already be available in some form in xffm but we are focusing on Thunar.
:Note: Exaile! already supports playing Video according to <nowiki>[[http://www.exaile.org/forum/thread/42|this topic]]</nowiki>. -- VincentZekred 
==== Desktop UI improvements ====

These require significant changes to upstream code, which is in feature freeze. They would be nice to have
but not as important as the previous group

* DnD launchers from desktop menu/appfinder to panel (w/o explicit need for customize panel mode)
* Menubar like in Gnome (Apps/Places/System) instead of simple menu (Applications)
* More freedesktop.org compliant menu
* Move item to arbitrary places on panel (like in Gnome) w/o the separator widget hack. 
* Laptop support (hotkey handling for mixer/sleep, better power management UI)
 
==== Reducing duplication, reusing Ubuntu software ====

The main theme here is converting as much as sensible from gnome to gtk2 libs (will be even easier with GTK 2.10)
and possibly from C to PyGtk.
 
* Xubuntu-system-tools (see how to reduce duplication with g-s-t)
* Evaluate gnome-power-manager
* Look into CDBS multibuild to be able to build gtk and gnome versions of binary packages from same source package

==== Infrastructure ====

* Import upstream svn into bzr in LP and work on that

==== LTSP ====

* Improve Xfce specific thin client support based on feedback, colaborate with edubuntu
** Xubuntu themed login manager and bootsplash for MueKow: ltsp-build-client in the package ltsp-server needs theming support first (?)

==== Translations ====

* Xubuntu langpacks? Right now it's base langpacks + gnome langpacks (evince, gnumeric) for full desktop translation

==== Performance ====

* Revisit app selection (i.e. sylpheed-claws vs t-bird vs seamonkey)
** consider using skipstone instead of firefox for lightness
* Get involved in various upstream or ubuntu-wide performance work (X startup, gnome-perf, faster boot, etc)
* More perf measurement tools working OOTB in ubuntu to get more users to test (systemtap, exmap, new memprof, vmlinux with debug info for oprofile)
* Try getting the UbuntuLite people involved (hello UbuntuLite people)
