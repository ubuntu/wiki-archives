=== Detailed specification ===

The default media player (gMusicBrowser) has a distinct paradigm of media reproduction than most other media players. This causes problems when users expect the software to behave like any other media player would.

It's proposed to change the media player to one that can handle a nice amount of media files easily, while allowing searching by its tags and names, the reproduction should follow the visible playlist, as it should be expected, also saving playlists would be nice.
