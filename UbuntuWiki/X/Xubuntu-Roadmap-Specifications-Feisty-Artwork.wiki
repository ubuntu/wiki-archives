__TOC__

=== Summary ===
The purpose of this document is to describe the process aiming at the creation of the default desktop look and feel for xubuntu Feisty. In this development phase, top priority should be given to the creation of a unified desktop. I expect that Feisty will be the most tightly composed visual experience to-date. 

'''Feisty Artwork Subcategories:'''

=== Targeted areas are ===
* Wallpaper 
* Gdm login screen 
* Usplash 
* Logo 
* Icons 
* Gtk theme
=== Wallpaper ===
The aim is to create an attractive visual experience that is pleasant to look at and good on the eye. 
Suggestion: let's get rid of the the current color scheme and create a more elegant, saturated blue variant. Here are some examples:

=== Gdm log-in screen ===
Use the same design elements as the wallpaper (like fedora, kubuntu). The log-in box can have the same glossy feel as dapper but simplified. I already have some ideas. 
=== Usplash ===
For the time being let's stick with the current one. Wait and see what direction the other ubuntu flavors go in this regard. Until, I fix up the gradient behind the logo of the current one to get rid of the ugly color banding effect. 
=== Logo ===
Basic vertical logo:
<nowiki>[[attachment:vertXubLogo.svg]]</nowiki>

We can stick with the current one, unless somebody has a better idea.

I took the distributor-logo.svg from the tango icon set, changed the colors, added the mouse, and made <nowiki>[[attachment:xubuntu-logo.svg]]</nowiki>! I was missing an svg logo, especially for the welcome center. The mouse surely can be improved. -- RadomirDopieralski

=== Icons ===
Needs to be discussed. The current blue doesn't contrast well with the background. Instead, I recommend using the gray tango or the new gnome icon set.

=== Gtk theme ===
Would be nice to have a gtk theme specifically made for Xubutu Fiesty.
 
===== Murrina theme pack, closely resembles to clearlooks =====

=== How to contribute ===

Contributing to the xubuntu art-project is always welcome. The best way to contribute is to offer a design concept for the entire desktop. A plan like this can incorporate visual themes like the usplash, login screen background and so on. Individual pieces are also welcome but keep in mind that conflicting designs and styles are hard to integrate into a coherent look and feel. 
Icon design and gtk theme customization are also possible areas for contribution.
