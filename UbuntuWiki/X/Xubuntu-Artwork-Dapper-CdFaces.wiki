__TOC__

A page to collect artworks aimed at being printed on cd surfaces.

== CD Faces ==

=== Xubuntu cd face - generic ===

I like printing my CDs and I usually end editing images from Breezy (whose cd faces I like more than Dapper) with the GIMP.

I wanted something easier to scale so I've prepared a svg file. Everyone can easily add writings to it, like release number, "live|install" or whatever. 
This image is based on Breezy CD faces found at <nowiki>[[DIYMarketing]]</nowiki> and the logo found at <nowiki>[[XubuntuArtwork]]</nowiki> page.

You can download the vectorial image from the following link:

Have a nice print.
