=== Specification ===
Improve Xubuntu's current plymouth bootscreen. There are a few features we should implement, such as proper wallpaper scaling, and we should probably revisit the boot animation.

===== Features =====
* Proper wallpaper scaling (<nowiki>[[http://brej.org/blog/?p=197|Look here]]</nowiki> for how it could be done)
* Implement circular animation instead of the misleading progressbar (pulsing, a spinner etc.) (Again, <nowiki>[[http://brej.org/blog/?p=197|look here]]</nowiki>)
* Use a symlink to Xubuntu's current wallpaper instead of shipping it inside the theme (unless we want xubuntu's plymouth theme to function independantly as well -> look at packaging recommends and depends)
