__TOC__

* Team meetings:
** * Team updates:
** ochosi is testing getting rid of gnome-icon-theme in 14.04 to reduce overhead
** Everyone can test that by using the shimmer daily PPA (bluesabre put up trusty packages today)
** skellat is satisfied with testing whiskermenu via no-change backport to 12.04 and is willing to vote on a proposal to make it default
** skellat has made no-change backport versions available in ppa:skellat/tests for those willing to try whiskermenu who are not yet on trusty
** ali1234 made a tool to easily change panel layouts: https://github.com/ali1234/panel-switch/ command line only at the moment, but it does the job. needs someone to design a gui
** Set up call for testing schedule
** Image testing: 64 bit - 5 people did 7.3% of all possible tests and for 32 bit - 4 people did 13.2% of all possible tests
** Automatic image testing - working for us now, though currently all failing due to the user-session bug, can be seen here https://jenkins.qa.ubuntu.com/view/All/job/ubiquity_ap-xubuntu_devel_daily-run/
** Package testing - 13/13 Mandatory, 4/5 Run Once, 10/22 Optional - atm 3 people tested packages(these all need further testing calls though) re schedule
** Used the contact team members (xubuntu-testers) for testing call last time, 1 person amongst those mentioned above seems new to me
** QA team is running now - good forward step this, everyone knows (or should) what each other is working on
** Call to be written explaining exploratory testing - these will be reported via packages tracker, but is about people testing when they're using apps rather than to a schedule
** gthumb 3.2.5 is now uploaded, a second upload will re-add webapps
** Sent "What's New in Trusty" doc proposal email to ML
** autopilot tests has a bit of a step forward, looks like we can do some basic testing with the xfce at the moment (checking to see if they open)
