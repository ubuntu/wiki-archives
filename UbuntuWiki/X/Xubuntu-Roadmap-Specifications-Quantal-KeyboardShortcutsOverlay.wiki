=== Detailed specification ===

==== Rationale ====
In this section we'll briefly outline what the KSO is and why and how it could help to improve the current situation of keyboard shortcuts.

===== What is the Keyboard-Shortcuts Overlay? =====
Ubuntu introduced an interesting small goody in the Precise-cycle, namely a keyboard-shortcuts overlay. This can easily be triggered by holding the Super-Key a bit longer. It shows an overlay (i.e. semi-transparent window without window-decoration) that displays an overview over the most important keyboard shortcuts. This gives users quick access to something that is usually only for power-users and I think it could improve the workflow of Xubuntu users as well.

===== Keyboard Shortcuts in Xubuntu/Xfce (currently) =====
Currently keyboard shortcuts can easily be accessed in two settings-dialogs, window-manager settings > keyboard and keyboard-settings > applications.
Personally I think it's a pity that these shortcuts are spread over two very different places, even if the type of shortcuts differ by category. It's just not very discoverable at first.

===== How this could be improved =====
Obviously one way of fixing this would be to create one place in the settings-manager where all keyboard-shortcuts can be accessed and edited. The Keyboard-Shortcut Overlay could help by providing an overview and theoretically it could contain links to the respective dialogs for editing an existing shortcut.

==== Implementation ====
This section will contain more practical stuff that concern the implementation of the KSO directly.
===== Technical Stuff =====
* How the keyboard-shortcuts can be queried via xfconf-query.
* How to create an overlay that has some transparency/alpha and now window-borders. Look at other applications.
* Fallback-mode for people without compositing, what could that look like?
* Show user-defined keyboard shortcuts as well, or show only our specialized set?

===== Categories =====
The KSO in Unity uses the following categories: Launcher, Dash, HUD & Menubar, Switching, Workspaces, Windows.
Xubuntu does not have the first three, but does have application specific shortcuts.  I propose the following categories:
* Applications (Open the Menu, Firefox, Thunderbird, Thunar, etc.)
* Switching
* Workspaces
* Windows
