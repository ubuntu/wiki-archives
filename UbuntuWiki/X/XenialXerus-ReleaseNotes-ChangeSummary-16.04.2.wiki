__TOC__


This is a brief summary of bugs fixed between Ubuntu 16.04.1 and 16.04.2.  '''This summary covers only changes to packages in ''__main__'' and ''__restricted__'', which account for all packages in the officially-supported CD images; there are further changes to various packages in ''universe'' and ''multiverse''.'''  Some of these fixes were by Ubuntu developers directly, while others were by upstream developers and backported to Ubuntu.  For full details, see the individual package changelogs.

In addition to the bugs listed below, this update includes all security updates from the <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/trusty|Ubuntu Security Notice list]]</nowiki> affecting Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS that were released up to and including February 15, 2017.  The last update included was USN-3197-1 (libgc vulnerability).

=== Installation bug fixes ===

| lightdm
| Bug:1582242
| Add support for greeters running inside sessions. This is enabled by setting X-LightDM-Allow-Greeter inside the session .desktop file. The session can then use liblightdm to connect one greeter to the daemon. The communication is done using a socket (/var/run/lightdm/<user>/greeter-socket) that is accessible to any process run by that user. Consider controlling access to this socket using a MAC system such as AppArmor. (LP: #1582242)

=== Kernel and Hardware support updates ===

Considerable work has been done in Ubuntu 16.04.1 on improving support for many specific items of hardware.

Note that upstream commits to stable kernel releases are listed separately below.

|-
| makedumpfile
| Bug:1571590
| Fix networked kdump failure to reach remote server. Avoids "Network is unreachable" message when trying to do remote dumps on either SSH or NFS. (LP: #1571590)
|-
| makedumpfile
| Bug:1568952
| Replace maxcpus by nr_cpus nr_cpus is a hard limit that has an impact on the (kdump) kernel memory consumption, while it is not the case with maxcpus=1, as we can theoretically hotplug cpus with maxcpus=1 (LP: #1568952)
|-
| makedumpfile
| Bug:1599561
| define_stampdir() : Loop on hostname -I for 5 sec to get IP address if HOSTTAG=ip. The network stack may not be ready when kdump-config runs. Give it some time before reverting HOSTTAG to hostname if an IP address cannot be found. (LP: #1599561)
|-
| makedumpfile
| Bug:1570775
| Add cio_ignore result to /etc/default/kdump-tools on s390x In order to have crashkernel=128M to work correctly on the s390 architecture the result of cio_ignore -u -k needs to be appended to the KDUMP_CMDLINE_APPEND variable in /etc/default/kdump-tools. This patch adds the required logic to do the proper modification.  (LP: #1570775)

|-
| systemd
| Bug:1615021
| 73-usb-net-by-mac.rules: Do not run readlink for *every* uevent, and merely check if /etc/udev/rules.d/80-net-setup-link.rules exists. A common way to disable an udev rule is to just "touch" it in /etc/udev/rule.d/ (i. e. empty file), and if the rule is customized we cannot really predict anyway if the user wants MAC-based USB net names or not.

| init-system-helpers
| Bug:1576692
| invoke-rc.d, service: Only ignore systemd unit dependencies before multi-user.target. "systemctl is-system-running" might still be false in case of running jobs  for device/mount/hotplug/dynamic actions units. But in those cases we already do want to respect unit dependencies, as the system is booted up sufficiently to avoid dependency loops. Thus weaken the condition to "multi-user.target is active". This does not change the behaviour for single-user: is-system-running has always been false there, so dependencies continue to be ignored. Fixes installation of packages like PostgreSQL under cloud-init or when manually installing packages right after booting. LP: #1576692

| debian/rules: Clean up *.busname units. They are useless in 16.04 as they will always be "condition failed" as kdbus has never existed.

| Bug:1636912
| Drop systemd-networkd's "After=dbus.service" ordering so that it can start during early boot (for cloud-init.service). It will auto-connect to D-Bus once it becomes available later, and transient (from DHCP) hostname and timezone setting do not work in 16.04 anyway. (LP: #1636912)
