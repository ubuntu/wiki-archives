=== SNA - 2D Graphics Acceleration ===

'SNA' ("Sandybridge New Acceleration") is a new and improved acceleration method for the Intel X driver. It began development a couple years ago, and is considered stable today.

Ubuntu's current default acceleration method is 'UXA'.  It has known bugs which are unlikely to be fixed at this point, and the expectation is that everyone should be moving to SNA.  We would like to make this change in Ubuntu, but also we want to avoid regressions.

In order to make the decision easier, we're asking people to try it out for a week. It's been working well on the hardware we've tested, but the wider variety of Intel graphics hardware we can get data from, the better.

Testing will continue until 2013-01-17, and the decision to change the default will be made by then. If there are bugs that upstream can commit to fixing soon, we might still flip the default for raring.

=== How to Test ===

If you're running Ubuntu 13.04 (Raring) we'd like to get feedback from you about the current state of SNA from as wide range of intel graphics hardware as possible. To test, please follow the steps below:

1. Upgrade to current raring, to make sure you have the latest intel driver
2. Download <nowiki>[[attachment:xorg.conf]]</nowiki> and copy to /etc/X11/xorg.conf
3. Reboot
4. Verify you're using SNA
 <pre>
# grep "SNA init" /var/log/Xorg.0.log
 [ 24978.294] (II) intel(0): SNA initialized with IvyBridge backend
 </pre>
5. Use the machine
6. After testing a while (a day or two), add your results below
** kernel version: 
  <pre>
## uname -r
3.7.0-7-generic
  </pre>
** VGA info:
  <pre>
## lspci -nn | grep VGA | sed 's/.*Intel Corporation //'
  2nd Generation Core Processor Family Integrated Graphics Controller [8086:0126] (rev 09)
  </pre>
7. Remember to file a bug if you find regressions compared to UXA (verify by changing "sna" to "uxa" in xorg.conf)
 <code># ubuntu-bug xorg </code>

=== Issues? File a Bug ===

If you do experience any issues such as hangs or graphics corruptions due to SNA being enabled, please let us know by filing a bug. Include a photo of the screen if appropriate.  To file a bug, run the following command:

<code># ubuntu-bug xorg</code>

Please be sure to file a bug and note it in the "Issues" column of the Test Results. Otherwise, we will not know how to contact you in order to help resolve your issue.
