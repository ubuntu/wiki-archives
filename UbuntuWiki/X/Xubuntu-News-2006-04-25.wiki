__TOC__

We are pleased to announce that Xubuntu now has a home on the web.

You can access the Xubuntu homepage at http://www.xubuntu.org. It currently links to important Xubuntu wiki pages, that are hosted on the Ubuntu wiki. We will soon have a Xubuntu skin for the Ubuntu wiki, to ensure consistency for our website users.
