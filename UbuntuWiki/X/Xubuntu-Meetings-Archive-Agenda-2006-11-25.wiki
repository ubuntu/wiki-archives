=== XUBUNTU WEBSITE ===

==== INTRODUCTION ====

    The Xubuntu website is an excellent tool for propagating information to the
    community and is generally the first impression made on end-users. Hence,
    The Xubuntu Website must maintain a professional image, be informative, useful,
    and personify the personality of the Xubuntu distribution and Xubuntu community.

***** Work on front page (professionalism, make it more informative, etc.)
***** Redo screen-shot page to use a gallery module to allow for easy organizing and maintenance of screen-shots.
***** Consider having set of tabs at the top similar to sister projects
***** Rename menu entry "Xubuntu in the press" to something shorter? Currently it stands out too much due to length.

=== OTHER TOPICS: ===

* Welcome Centre - Do we need it? What do we put in it? (RadomirDopieralski)

* (freedesktop compliant) Menu Editor - In general users are not happy with xfce menu editor, it could be an idea to use desktop files and to copy them in $HOME in case the user customize them. There is python-xdg that can help very much ([WWW] Xdg desktop files paths)

* Desktop Search Tool - Xubuntu lacks of a desktop search tool, available engine are tracker and xapian both already in the archive, while available frontend are Pinot and Tracker itself, Tracker needs to be cleaned of gnome deps (an xfce-panel plugin could be inspired by the gnome applet)

* - Keyboards - Users are saying that ubuntu has a better support for keyboards, we need to investigate how gnome can obtain it.

* Beryl - ?
