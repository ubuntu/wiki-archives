__TOC__


This is a brief summary of bugs fixed between Ubuntu 16.04.4 and 16.04.5.  '''This summary covers only changes to packages in ''__main__'' and ''__restricted__'', which account for all packages in the officially-supported CD images; there are further changes to various packages in ''universe'' and ''multiverse''.'''  Some of these fixes were by Ubuntu developers directly, while others were by upstream developers and backported to Ubuntu.  For full details, see the individual package changelogs.

In addition to the bugs listed below, this update includes all security updates from the <nowiki>[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/releases/ubuntu-16.04-lts/|Ubuntu Security Notice list]]</nowiki> affecting Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS that were released up to and including July 30, 2018.  The last update included was USN-3725-1 (MySQL vulnerabilities).

=== Installation bug fixes ===

Updated CD images are provided with this release, including fixes for some installation bugs.  (Many installation problems are hardware-specific; for those, see "Hardware support bugs" below.)

| debian/extra/start-udev: test that sync parameters file is writable, before writing to it. On old kernels (e.g. v4.4) the file is available but is read-only, thus writing to it causes init to fail and thus raise a kernel panic. As an extra caution ignore failures to write into that file anyway, since synchronous scsi probing is not critical enough to prevent starting d-i. LP: #1784454
