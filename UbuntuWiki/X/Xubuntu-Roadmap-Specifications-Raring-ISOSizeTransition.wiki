=== Detailed specification ===

'''''Note:'' This specification is still in the drafting/discussion state. The decision will be made at a later date.'''

This specification discusses the benefits and disadvantages of moving to a 1GB ISO size.

=== Benefits ===
* Able to reintroduce Gnumeric
* Less maintaining work (considering we don't fill the ISO to the edge again...)
* Able to (re)introduce more languages

=== Disadvantages ===
* Optical media limited to DVD

=== Things to do ===
* Prepare an announcement to be published parallel to change
* Document alternative methods of installing Xubuntu with a CD-size (or smaller) image
