__TOC__

Heading for 10.04, Xubuntu has seen several updates, as always providing a pleasant and lightweight computing environment for all those wanting to go with the Xfce desktop by default. Along with the usual updates of core components and infrastructure like the Linux kernel, Plymouth splash screen and graphics card drivers, there are some changes noteworthy about Xubuntu 10.04.

== What's new ==

* Accessibility first: In order to assist all these in need of an on-screen keyboard, OnBoard has been added to "Accessoires" in the default installation.

* All work and no play make Jack a dull boy. In order to help Jack, Xubuntu comes with a fine and revamped selection of games including classics like Mahjongg, Sudoku and Solitaire.

* Imagine! While replaced in the Ubuntu distribution, Xubuntu 10.04 continues to offer the GNU Image Manipulation Program in the default installation. Along with this, Xsane has been replaced in favour of SimpleScan to ease setup and operation of scanners.

* More bits in times of need: The all-new "Ubuntu Software Center" replaces the "Add/Remove ..." option provided in earlier versions.

* Changes in applications provided with Xubuntu include a significant update of Gnumeric (to version 1.10.1), resolving most of the issues seen in earlier Xubuntu versions. Likewise, "Remote Filesystems" has been renamed to Gigolo and provides access to a vast array of remote file system technologies, including SMB, SSH/SFTP and WebDAV.

* Thanks to fixes in PulseAudio, by now sound no longer is muted during system startup.

== Bugs ==

As this is a Beta release, some critical issues still are left to be addressed:

* There is a critical bug in Abiword that causes a freeze for most users when anything under the Help menu is selected. This does cause you to lose the document you are working on. (https://launchpad.net/bugs/519541)

* There are still issues being worked concerning Plymouth and Nvidia video. Due to these issues, the splash screens on boot look less good than desired. (http://www.netsplit.com/2010/03/30/all-about-kernel-mode-setting/)"
