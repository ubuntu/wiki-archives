== Who Do We Market To? ==

''Ideas on what specific groups of people we should market to.''

* Windows Users, specifically those who use Windows 98 or 2000.
*** Emphasize speed, security, and support. (Security and support lacking in Windows.)
*** Reusing old hardware. Savings.

* Users of other Distros.
*** Ubuntu users. (I know of a few people who try Ubuntu and find it rather slow, and ditch it and go back to Windows. Show them Xubuntu and they may reconsider Linux.)
*** Simply try to gain some more ground. :-)

* Promote Xubuntu as being good for thin-client deployments.

* Xubuntu is good for workstations too.
