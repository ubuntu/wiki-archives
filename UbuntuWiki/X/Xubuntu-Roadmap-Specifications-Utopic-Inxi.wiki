** IRC: Asking someone in #xubuntu to run ''inxi -Gxxx -c0 | pastebinit'' in order to get the
      graphics card, what driver it's using, what version, and some additional information would be very useful.
      Some other common options are as follows.
**** ''-r'' for repositories
**** ''-n'' / ''-N'' for network information
**** ''-S'' for general system information.
**** ''-s'' for sensor information.
**** ''-p'' / ''-P'' for partition data.
**** ''-M'' for Machine data (vendor, product, bios, etc.)
**** ''-f'' for CPU flags.
**** ''-F'' for full output.
      ...and others.  To get more detailed information, you use the `-x` or `-xx` options, and `-c [number]` to change output colors, 0 for no color.

** Forums: This could also be quite useful on the forums, you likely wouldn't need to dump the information in a pastebin.

* Easy tool to get various information about your system.
