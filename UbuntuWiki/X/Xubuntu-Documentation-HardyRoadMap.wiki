== Xubuntu Hardy Docs Roadmap ==
This document will serve as a roadmap for the Xubuntu Hardy docs. General ideas and broad concepts and areas that we would like to add to the docs will be talked about here. If you have a specific bug to report, please file it in <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/~xubuntu-doc/+assignedbugs|Launchpad]]</nowiki>. The page is broken down roughly by goals to be accomplished followed by how we plan on accomplishing them.

=== Recruit some new talent ===
How to (hopefully) do this:
* identify areas of the wiki where changes or updates are needed. keep track of these if changes aren't made so they can be assigned to new docs members as an easy introduction into the doc team. basically we want to "fix the wiki".
** put someone experienced with wikis in general (and preferably the ubuntu wiki in particular) in charge of identifying areas where new members can help improve the wiki. this person should make a plan, set goals for what new members should accomplish and serve as a resource for new people who may not have much experience editing the wiki.
* create a list of bugs in Launchpad against the xubuntu docs that can serve as good starting points for new members.
* attempt to recruit new docs people looking for mentoring by contacting people/getting them interested in Xubuntu.

=== Improve the docs ===
We need to improve the docs measurably for this release. In addition to making updates based on development changes, we need to add information to make the docs more useful to users at various experience levels. Hardy is an LTS release so this is important. This is the "roadmap" part. Let's have some general ideas that we can build on so we can decide where to devote our resources.

* j1mc - more information about everything under "settings"
* j1mc - We need to better understand the release note creation processes and policies of the Ubuntu team, and see how we can better involve ourselves with these processes.   Much like the creation of the actual docs, In the past we have gotten the foundation for our release notes from the Ubuntu release notes, and have modified these notes based on what is unique to Xubuntu.   This approach has some advantages and drawbacks.  Establishing and documenting a more clear Release note creation process would help us to work more efficiently and consistently.
* oldmanstan - it would be great if we could get tight integration between the dev and doc people. obviously the dev people have intimate knowledge of the changes being made to the distro and which of those changes will likely require the users to interact differently with the system than they have in the past. getting the dev people involved in identifying areas of the distro that should have better docs would help since it would allows us to prioritize better.
