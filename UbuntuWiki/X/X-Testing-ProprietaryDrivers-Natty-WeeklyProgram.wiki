== X Proprietary Drivers Testing ==

=== Call For Testing ===

<pre>
Call For Testing: nVIDIA graphic cards

Do you have a *nVIDIA* graphics card? Do you want to help
ensure users have a smooth experience if they choose to use the
proprietary drivers?

We are looking for committed volunteers to test nVIDIA and proprietary
drivers on a weekly basis. The goal of this testing is 
to catch regressions early in the cycle, and fix bugs before they 
reach a major audience.

If you want to be part of the team you will need:

1. A computer with an nVIDIA (GeForce 6 or newer) graphics card
2. A spare partition on that system
** If you don't have a spare partition you can easily create one.
3. One hour of your time per week
4. An Internet connection

If you want to take part in this adventure, go to:
  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Testing/ProprietaryDrivers/Natty/WeeklyProgram
and follow the detailed instructions.

Thanks for helping making Ubuntu even better!

P.S. This project is to test the proprietary drivers. If you're 
interested in testing the free drivers, we don't need installation 
testing but help is always welcome. Check how at the Ubuntu X team
page [1].

=== Setting Up Instructions ===

# Every tested system needs to have a spare partition, because the program involves fresh installations of Ubuntu. If you don't have a spare partition, you can create one following <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowtoPartition/ResizingPartition|these instructions]]</nowiki>.
# I know some of you have several systems, but our tracker has some limitations that prevent to provide two results for the same account. To avoid creating too much trouble, just select one of your systems and test ALWAYS with that system. []
# You have to have an account in our tracking system. We are going to use it to generate data (it will be publicly available).
## Go to <nowiki>[[http://xorg.qa.ubuntu.com]]</nowiki>.
## Click on "Log In" and "Create New Account"
## Once you have activated your account, go to the "My profile" page.
## Under the field "PCI devices list:" paste the output of the command : 'lspci -v' . This is an important field, as we are going to use it to generate our reports. Please, fill it only with the graphics card model that you are testing with that tracker account.
## Under the field "Global hardware description" add the model that you are testing. Add any additional information to describe the hardware you are testing and not provided by lspci.
# Once you're done with the tracker, add yourself to the list of participants in this page.
# Once you have added yourself to the list of testers in this page, ask to be included in the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~xorg-prop-drivers-testers|Xorg Proprietary Drivers Testers]]</nowiki> team in Launchpad and subscribe to the mailing list once you've been approved.
# You're all set!

=== Testing Instructions ===

Every week, starting on March 14th (see <nowiki>[[#Calendar|Calendar]]</nowiki>), we will be starting a new testing cycle. The tests will appear in the tracker and everybody is free to submit their results any time during the week. The following Monday a new cycle will start, and results will be fresh again. If you miss a week, don't worry, you can keep testing the following week.

Most of the tests involves installing an updated ISO of Ubuntu Natty. Daily ISO images are found at <nowiki>[[http://cdimage.ubuntu.com|cdimage.ubuntu.com]]</nowiki>. We advise that you download the images you expect to test ahead of time and use zsync to update them, as this will reduce the turn around time on testing.

For every image at <nowiki>[[http://cdimage.ubuntu.com|cdimage.ubuntu.com]]</nowiki> there is a .zsync link that you can use with zsync to sync your images. I.e.:

<pre>
zsync http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-live/current/natty-desktop-i386.iso.zsync
</pre>

Every week, you will see the tracker (<nowiki>[[http://xorg.qa.ubuntu.com]]</nowiki>) reset. You need to click on your model to see the list of testcases:

<nowiki>[[File:model_natty.png]]</nowiki>

The list of testcases appear, with a summary on how many results have been reported:

<nowiki>[[File:list.png]]</nowiki>

To read the instructions on how to perform the testing, and report your result, click on any of them. The testcase view will show a form to report your result and a link to the testcase wiki, to guide you through the process:

<nowiki>[[File:testcase.png]]</nowiki>

To report bugs, follow the instructions at <nowiki>[[X-Reporting]]</nowiki>.

=== FAQ ===

==== Can I install [K,X]ubuntu instead? ====
For the moment we are only interested in Ubuntu results, sorry.

==== Desktop or Alternate? i386 or amd64? ====
As you wish, the more different configurations, the merrier.
