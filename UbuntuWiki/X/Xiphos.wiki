=== Ethos ===

&ldquo;For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart.&rdquo; &mdash; Hebrews 4:12 (ESV)

Xiphos (Greek: ξίφος) is a double-edged, single-hand sword used by the ancient Greeks.
