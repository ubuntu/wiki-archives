== Information about Ubuntu 10.10 ==

<nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MaverickMeerkat/ReleaseNotes|Release Notes]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MaverickMeerkat/TechnicalOverview|Technical Overview]]</nowiki> concern all Ubuntu derivatives and Ubuntu specifically. 

Read on for specific improvements in Xubuntu.

== What's new in Xubuntu ==

Some of the highlights of the 10.10 release include:

* Xubuntu now uses Parole, the Xfce4 Media Player, to provide an improved audio/video experience.
* Xfburn has replaced Brasero for a more resource consious CD/DVD burning tool.
* Xfce4-taskmanager has replaced Gnome-Task-Manager, providing similar function with fewer resources required.
* Gnumeric has been updated to version 1.10.8, and Abiword is now version 2.8.6.
* A brand new theme from the Shimmer team has been introduced. Known as Bluebird, it is lighter in color than the themes in previous versions while retaining the full elementary icon set and the darker panels. 

== Bugs ==

* The new Xorg 1.9 available in Maverick is not compatible with nVidia based chipsets that use the (nvidia-96) and (nvidia-173) drivers. <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/626974|Bug 626974]]</nowiki>
