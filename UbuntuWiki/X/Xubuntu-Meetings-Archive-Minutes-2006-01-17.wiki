*** documenting efforts have started in the ubuntu-doc team, one of the contact persons is John Levin
*** we will proceed with current artwork and ask feedback as soon as we have CDs and more users
*** i18n - decided to contact xfce-i18n team and get people from various locales involved in translating xubuntu docs and related apps
*** the subject of media player was brought up and the possibility of using quodlibet instead of xfmedia, this will need further discussion
*** the subject of separate forums for xubuntu users was deferred till we have more users. John Levin is in contact with the forum admins in case the need arises.
