Proposed agenda for the next Xubuntu meeting (Wed, Apr 05 2006 14:00 UTC)

=== 1. Xubuntu final logo ===

Which logo will be used?

Different POV have been sent on the <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/xubuntu-devel/2006-April/000918.html|mailing list]]</nowiki>.

<nowiki>[[http://www.dsslive.org/xubuntu/tmp/artworks/html/logos.html|Proposed logos]]</nowiki>

=== 2. xfce4-goodies meta package ===

With the isos available, it could be a good idea to have an installable goodies meta package.
