=== Introduction ===

This page lists the different Xubuntu documentation topics and the person who is assigned to complete each topic for the current release cycle.  This is meant to show the progress of the documentation work for the Gutsy release cycle as well help track topics and see contributor's progress.

=== Status ===

Please note the status of each particular topic as you work on it.   If you have started work on a topic, please list it's status as "In Progress," and include an approximate "percent completed."  

A completed topic (with all patches applied, can be marked as "Completed," or \o/.

To indicate how along you are on a topic, please use the following background color for a topic:

<pre>
New / Untouched:  Blank
To Do (assigned to you but no progress): yellow
In Progress: lightgreen
Needs Review: lightblue
Reviewed / Completed: gray
</pre>

Deadlines are estimates and non-binding as of now, but please expect to complete one topic per week.  This means we should get all the topics completed and uploaded for review by at least August 27th. This will give us three weeks worth of review before string freeze which is September 15th.

==== Miscellaneous ====

Some of these topics are much easier than others. Several topics can be done in one week while other topics may take longer. 

==== General Notes ====

Nixternal volunteered to help us with our make file.

There is a problem with ghelp:sectionid links affecting most of the documentation. A solution is being discussed.
