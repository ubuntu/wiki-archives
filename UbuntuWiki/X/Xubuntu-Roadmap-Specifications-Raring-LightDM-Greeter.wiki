__TOC__

This is a short specification of what could be improved in the lightdm-gtk-greeter and what design it could feature.
It will show a few mockups and describe the functionality the gtk-greeter should gain.

There's also another (collaborative) effort with folks from Lubuntu to improve the greeter: <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/frankbooth/lightdm-gtk-greeter|link]]</nowiki>

<nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/lightdm-gtk-switcher|Launchpad Project]]</nowiki>

=== Features ===
** Show clock/date
** Integrate accessibility menu and shutdown/restart menu into login-box and drop top panel
** Lock the screen
** Correctly scale the wallpaper/background
** Better multi-monitor support (as laid out <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xubuntu/Roadmap/Specifications/Quantal/MultipleMonitors|here]]</nowiki>)

=== Screen Lock (Postponed) ===
'''Todo list''':
** find which dbus call is used to lock the session with lightdm (cf. http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~lightdm-team/lightdm/trunk/view/head:/tests/src/test-session.c#L45)
** There is a command that does this, gdmflexiserver
** This command does the dbus call as such
*** dbus-send --system --type=method_call --print-reply --dest=org.freedesktop.DisplayManager $XDG_SEAT_PATH org.freedesktop.DisplayManager.Seat.SwitchToGreeter
*** Neither Seat.SwitchToGreeter, nor Seat.Lock or Session.Lock seem to really lock the session, instead lightdm gets respawned at tty9.
** update action plugin from xfce4-panel (cf. http://git.xfce.org/xfce/xfce4-panel/tree/plugins/actions/actions.c#n963, probably not needed, xflock4 is called)
** update xflock4 (cf. http://git.xfce.org/xfce/xfce4-session/tree/scripts/xflock4)
** update xfce4-power-manager (cf. http://git.xfce.org/xfce/xfce4-power-manager/tree/common/xfpm-common.c#n82, add a call to xflock4 first)
** test?

=== The Plan ===
* Modify xflock4 and run tests
** Panel > Action Buttons '''(Done)'''
** xflock4 from Terminal '''(Done)'''
** Power Manager > Suspend
* Modify the greeter so that certain widgets are not shown (or are insensitive) when used as a lock screen.
** User Selection combobox
** Session combobox
** Language combobox
* Add a ''Switch User'' button

=== Mockups ===
** Here's an interesting mockup taken from Debian's artwork contest, entitled <nowiki>[[http://wiki.debian.org/DebianArt/Themes/7th-element|7th-element]]</nowiki>.
