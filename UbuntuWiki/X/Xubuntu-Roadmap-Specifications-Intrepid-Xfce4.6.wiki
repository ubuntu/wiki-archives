== Intrepid & Xfce 4.6 ==

This page describes our plans for Xfce 4.6 during the Intrepid release cycle.

Currently 4.5.80 (4.6beta) is being packaged in the xubuntu-dev PPA. Current notes so far

=== xfconf ===
New Package, replaces xfce-mcs.
** Missing manpages for binary
** Affected by the libtool --as-needed bug

=== xfce4-mixer ===

* Upstream rewrote to use gstreamer vs. alsa/oss directly.
* Needs patches ported (code has internally redone to the point that a rewrite is needed).

=== xfce4-panel ===
* missing manpages

=== xfce-session ===
* binary-without-manpage

=== xfce4-settings ===
* Missing manpages
* Missing Debian menu files (?)

=== xfdesktop4 ===
* Xubuntu specific menu options need to be added (Important)
* Lintian is NOT happy (desktop file warnings), need to discuss how to fix
* Need to determine proper course of action w.r.t. to desktop files issue (see [Xfdesktop4DesktopFilesIssue])
