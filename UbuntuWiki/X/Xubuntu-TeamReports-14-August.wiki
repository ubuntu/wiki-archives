* Team Updates
** skellat has been engaged in backport requests and sync requests
** bluesabre enabled clutter in parole, but it's not been set xubuntu-default-settings yet.
** Beta 1 in 2 weeks time - will call for testing, depending on response will reflect on whether to bother with Final Beta
** Debian import freeze went into effect
** Feature freeze came up on the 21st
** we now have pkexec policy files for thunar and mousepad
** bluesabre to put list of xubuntu packageset packages on wiki (somebody beat me to it by adding the link)
** bluesabre to upload new xubuntu-default-settings
** bluesabre to enable clutter in parole, set as default in xubuntu-default-settings
** skellat mailed list to see if anyone wishes to identify specific low-hanging fruit tasks for the Global Jam
** ochosi did a new release of the icon theme that adds support for the new power-manager amongst others
** new versions of catfish, lightdm-gtk-greeter, xfce4-power-manager, xfce4-settings, light-locker-settings have landed
** ochosi talked to ubuntu devs about gtk3.12 affecting our default applications like evince. they will all remain in their gtk3.10 versions for 14.10, so we have nothing to worry about with headerbars and client-side decorations
** outside of that, headerbars and CSD work well enough with xubuntu... with compositor on they are fine, with it off, they have an extra xfwm titlebar on top
** apt-offline is fixed in utopic, courtesy of Unit193
** lightdm-gtk-greeter no longer supports proper centering, wondering if you guys think we should keep the "kinda-centered" layout, or consider others
* Released <nowiki>[[http://xubuntu.org/news/xubuntu-14-10-beta-1/|14.10 Beta 1]]</nowiki>
