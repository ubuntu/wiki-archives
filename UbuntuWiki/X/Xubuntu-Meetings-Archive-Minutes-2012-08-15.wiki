=== Meeting summary ===

==== Items carried on ====

* Open action items from previous meeting  (knome, 15:02:32)
** ''ACTION:'' xubuntu-team to investigate adding a screenlocker  (knome, 15:03:04)
** 16:37 < ochosi> knome, mr_pouit: let me add this to the "do away with xscreensaver, instead just use a lock-thingy", this is how far lightdm is in that respect: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/desktop-p-lock-screen  (pleia2, 15:05:02)
** < ochosi> i.e. not very far. i've been looking out for alternatives, and to be honest, none of them is working extra-smooth or great-looking  (pleia2, 15:05:10)
** I asked if there were others to try < ochosi> xlockmore, xlockmore-gl, xtrlock, i3lock  (pleia2, 15:05:43)
** < pleia2> is keeping xscreensaver and just defaulting to blank xscreensaver+screen lock an option?  (pleia2, 15:06:55)
** < ochosi> sure < pleia2> I think that may be as close as we can get until lightdm gets sorted  (pleia2, 15:07:09)
