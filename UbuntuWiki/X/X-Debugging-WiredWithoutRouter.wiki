== Achieving Wired Connection Without Router ==

This is a procedure for connecting a laptop that does not have wireless to one that does, via a direct ethernet wired connection.

First, connect the wired ports of the two computers using a standard ethernet cable.  (Once long ago you had to use crossover cables for this, but modern computers have auto-switching so no special cable is required.)

On the master system that *has* functional wireless:
** Go to Edit Connections
** On the Wired tab, select the connection (e.g. "Auto eth0") and click Edit
** on the IPv4 Settings tab, change Method to 'Shared to other computers', and click Apply
** Run 'ipconfig' and note the eth0 IP address chosen

On the slave system, that doesn't have wireless:
** Go to Edit Connections
** On the Wired tab select the connection (e.g. "Auto eth0") and click Edit
** On the IPv4 Settings tab, change Method to Manual
** Type in the master system's IP address for Gateway (E.g. 10.42.43.1)
** For Netmask type in 254.0.0.0
** For Address type in a number 1 greater than the Gateway (E.g. 10.42.43.2)
** Click Save
