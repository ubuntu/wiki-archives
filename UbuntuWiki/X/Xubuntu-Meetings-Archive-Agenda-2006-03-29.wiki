Proposed agenda for the next Xubuntu meeting (Wed, Mar 29 2006 14:00 UTC)

=== Xubuntu Look ===

Xubuntu still lacks of an icons theme, color palette, gtk,gfxboot themes.
All the #ubuntu-artwork people would be happy of taking care of all this, the condition is "tango icons theme".
This mean xubuntu will probably get a lot of help if inheriting xubuntu-icons-theme from tango one.

The only issue here is to have tango in main.
