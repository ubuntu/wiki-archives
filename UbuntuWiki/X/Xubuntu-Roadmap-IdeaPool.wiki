This page is used by the Xubuntu Team to track ideas about what should be done for the <nowiki>[[IntrepidIbex|Intrepid Ibex]]</nowiki> release. Anyone is free to add their own suggestions, but try to keep them short.  Exposing and discussing the technical implementation of an idea should '''not''' be done here, but in a separate wiki page created for this feature and tracked in launchpad.  You can more information about this process on the <nowiki>[[FeatureSpecifications|Feature Specifications]]</nowiki> wiki page.

'''Keep ideas to a short sentence''' and somehow categorized.

So what do you think should be done for the <nowiki>[[IntrepidIbex|Intrepid Ibex]]</nowiki>?
