We are pleased to announce that the first public beta release of Xubuntu, the latest official addition to the Ubuntu family of derivative distributions has arrived.

Xubuntu is built around  the solid Ubuntu core and the friendly and relatively lightweight
Xfce desktop environment, with the specific goal of providing a nice user experience
even on older hardware.
