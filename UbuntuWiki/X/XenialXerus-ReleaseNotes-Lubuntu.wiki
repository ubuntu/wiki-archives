* General bug fix release as we prepare for LXQt.
* Many LXDE components have been updated with bug fix releases.
* An update of the artwork (more icons, theme update, more compatibilities ...).
* lubuntu-extra-sessions: In the past, selecting different sessions (netbook, gaming etc.) was installed by default. This is now an optional extra that can be installed by those who want this added functionality.
* Lubuntu PPC Mac images are available in this <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LTS | LTS]]</nowiki> release.
 
=== Lubuntu Applications ===
* Based on the lightweight <nowiki>[[http://lxde.org/ | LXDE desktop environment]]</nowiki>.
* <nowiki>[[http://wiki.lxde.org/en/PCManFM | Pcmanfm]]</nowiki>, a fast and lightweight files manager using gio/gvfs.
* <nowiki>[[http://openbox.org/ | Openbox]]</nowiki>, the fast and extensible, default windows-manager of LXDE.
* <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/lightdm | Lightdm]]</nowiki>, using the simple GTK greeter
* Firefox, the famous web browser.
* For more detail, please see the <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/Setup#Applications | full list of applications]]</nowiki>.

=== System Requirements ===

Lubuntu is a good operating system for many old computers, but not for all of them. Some computers have too little horsepower or memory. A rule of thumb is that the computer should not pre-date 2000. The desktop images for lubuntu 16.04 requires a DVD / USB device to write it to, the alternate images are for those with have non-standard setups or Low RAM.

'''Memory (RAM)'''

For advanced internet services like Google+, YouTube, Google Docs and Facebook, your computer needs about 1 GB of RAM.

For local programs like LibreOffice and simple browsing habits, your computer needs about 512 MB of RAM. See <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/Documentation/MinimalInstall | minimal]]</nowiki> for systems below that RAM.

'''Processor (CPU)'''

The minimum specification for CPU is Pentium 4 or Pentium M or AMD K8.

Older processors are too slow and AMD K7 has problems with flash video.

'''Graphics chip / card'''

Nvidia, AMD/ATI/Radeon and Intel work out of the box, or the system can be tweaked to work fairly easily. You can get help at the <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org|Ubuntu Forums]]</nowiki>. With such graphics, or if you don't know, try the current Lubuntu version.

=== Upgrade ===

* Celeron M computers can have trouble installing, <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootOptions/before--after|workaround exists.]]</nowiki>
