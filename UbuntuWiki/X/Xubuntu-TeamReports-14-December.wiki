* Team Updates
** Lots of positive social media response to both the Xfce surveys and call for testing of Intelligent Panel
** Not much in the way of image testing currently
** jjfrv8 finished the power manager docs I started abd then postponed, and they're already online -> http://docs.xfce.org/xfce/xfce4-power-manager/1.4/start
** package testing slow - as expected, given we've pulled that back now
** QA and dev/ochosi calling for testing on staging
** jjfrv8 has been patiently checking through testcases for reporting issues
** Started planning a Xubuntu QA global jam for the California Lo``Co on Sunday February 8th, local marketing/qa?
** Thanks to Unit193 we'll have a panel in our ubiquity install session that exposes important indicators (network, sound, a11y)
** ochosi tested bluez5 (as that is supposedly an upcoming transition) and things seemed to work just fine (bluetooth keyboard)
** Unit193 and bluesabre are also working towards resolving the black background in our ubiquity install session
** gtk3.14 is still stuck, #ubuntu-desktop folks (mostly larsu) are still working on the transition
** Team vote, carried: Based on the feedback from the community, should we stick to our decision of not installing XChat by default anymore?
