__TOC__


This is a brief summary of bugs fixed between Ubuntu 16.04.6 and 16.04.7.  '''This summary covers only changes to packages in ''__main__'' and ''__restricted__'', which account for all packages in the officially-supported CD images; there are further changes to various packages in ''universe'' and ''multiverse''.'''  Some of these fixes were by Ubuntu developers directly, while others were by upstream developers and backported to Ubuntu.  For full details, see the individual package changelogs.

In addition to the bugs listed below, this update includes all security updates from the <nowiki>[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/releases/ubuntu-16.04-lts/|Ubuntu Security Notice list]]</nowiki> affecting Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS that were released up to and including August 6, 2020.  The last update included was USN-4453-1 (OpenJDK 8 vulnerabilities).

=== Installation bug fixes ===

Updated CD images are provided with this release, including fixes for some installation bugs.  (Many installation problems are hardware-specific; for those, see "Hardware support bugs" below.)

|-
| console-setup
| Bug:1824227
| setupcon: use /run for tempfiles (and dump the various unnecessary fallback paths), since /run is always mountable rw at least as early as /tmp is and is guaranteed to be safe from tmpcleaners at boot.  Only keep /tmp as a fallback in case we have access to write to /tmp and to a console, but not to /run
|}

=== Upgrade bug fixes ===

These changes fix upgrade issues, smoothing the way for future upgrades to later releases of Ubuntu.

| Bug:1778219
| Trigger unattended-upgrade-shutdown actions with PrepareForShutdown() Performing upgrades in service's ExecStop did not work when the upgrades involved restarting services because systemd blocked other stop/start actions making maintainer scripts time out and be killed leaving a broken system behind. Running unattended-upgrades.service before shutdown.target as a oneshot service made it run after unmounting filesystems and scheduling services properly on shutdown is a complex problem and adding more services to the mix make it even more fragile. The solution of monitoring PrepareForShutdown() signal from DBus allows Unattended Upgrade to run _before_ the jobs related to shutdown are queued thus package upgrades can safely restart services without risking causing deadlocks or breaking part of the shutdown actions. Also ask running unattended-upgrades to stop when shutdown starts even in InstallOnShutdown mode and refactor most of unattended-upgrade-shutdown to UnattendedUpgradesShutdown class.
|-
| unattended-upgrades
| Bug:1778219
| Increase logind's InhibitDelayMaxSec to 30s.  This allows more time for unattended-upgrades to shut down gracefully or even install a few packages in InstallOnShutdown mode, but is still a big step back from the 30 minutes allowed for InstallOnShutdown previously. Users enabling InstallOnShutdown node are advised to increase InhibitDelayMaxSec even further possibly to 30 minutes.
|-
| unattended-upgrades
| Bug:1803749
| Stop using ActionGroups, they interfere with apt.Cache.clear() causing all autoremovable packages to be handled as newly autoremovable ones and be removed by default. Dropping ActionGroup usage does not slow down the most frequent case of not having anything to upgrade and when there are packages to upgrade the gain is small compared to the actual package installation. Also collect autoremovable packages before adjusting candidates because that also changed .is_auto_removable attribute of some of them.  (Closes: #910874)
|-
| unattended-upgrades
| Bug:1789637
| Unlock for dpkg operations with apt_pkg.pkgsystem_unlock_inner() when it is available. Also stop running when reacquiring the lock fails. Thanks to Julian Andres Klode for original partial patch
|-
| unattended-upgrades
| Bug:1781586
| Skip rebuilding python-apt in upgrade autopkgtests. Python-apt has a new build dependency making the rebuilding as is failing and the reference handling issue is worked around in unattended-upgrades already.

| Fixed is_pkgname_in_blacklist to be side-effect free.  Otherwise 'is_pkgname_in_blacklist' mutates the 'pkgs_kept_back' and 'unattended-upgrades' treats the package as a blacklisted candidate
|-
| unattended-upgrades
| Bug:1602536
| unattended-upgrades: fix Unlocked context manager.  The Unlocked context manager did correctly unlock but did not reacquire the lock which means that in minimal-upgrade step mode it is possible to run apt code without a lock. If something else (like landscape, apt, synaptic, packagekit) locks the cache in the meantime this will work and u-u will get dpkg errors because dpkg will not be able to perform its operations. It is less of an issue in non-minimal mode, but even then the auto-remove step may fail in this way.

| Stop raising NoAllowedOriginError when marking packages to upgrade/install fails
|-
| unattended-upgrades
| Bug:1824804 Bug:1824949
| Adjust only transitive dependencies in the fallback when a package from an allowed origin can't be marked to install/upgrade. This is a much lighter approach than marking every upgradable package because the full fallback was triggered on packages held back as well, using an excessive amount of CPU time. Also it crashed with packages not having any version in allowed origins.

Hard-coding /snap/bin is less risky than backporting environment generator support and since snaps are considered to be first class packages on Ubuntu /snap/bin can safely added to the default PATH.

| Revert exclusion of makedev from buildd chroots, as it turned out not to be the problem.  Instead, fix up /dev/ptmx to be a character device node rather than a symlink to /dev/pts/ptmx, in line with the discussion in https://bugs.debian.org/817236; I think this is safer than cherry-picking the fix to debootstrap at this point in a stable release cycle .
