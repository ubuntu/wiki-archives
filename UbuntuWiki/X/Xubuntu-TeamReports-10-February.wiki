'''Xubuntu team report for February, 2010'''

This has been our best month ever.

===== Packaging, Development, & Testing =====
* Testing of the new LTS, Lucid Lynx, is continuing on schedule. We have entered the Feature Freeze for Lucid. From this point forward, emphasis should be on testing, bug fixing and polishing the new LTS.
* Testing discovered a couple of high importance bugs. One would have prevented all upgrades from the previous LTS to using update-manager. Another was an issue with the new Plymouth and NVidia video card incompatibility.
* Bug-triage team has triaged over 200 bugs this last month. Many bugs were resolved during this process.

===== Documentation =====
* Jim has begun work on Xubuntu docs, ported off of Ubuntu docs.  The bzr branch is located <nowiki>[[https://code.launchpad.net/~jwcampbell/xubuntu-docs/lucid-experimental|here]]</nowiki>, and will be merged to the current Xubuntu doc branch once stable. Conservatively, this will be ready within the next two weeks.
* Once that is done, Jim will need help from Pasi to work on the CSS theming and the landing page.
