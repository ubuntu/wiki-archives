== Artwork Guidelines ==

Our main goal with artwork is uniform and consistent brand. The branding should remind the users of Xubuntu as much as possible.

=== Consistency ===

==== Brand/logo ====

To make the branding consistent, artists should always use the official logo. This logos is provided as an attached SVG file. The font used in the file can be installed from apt-get (ttf-ubuntu-title).

==== General ====

Whenever an artist is creating a theme or a part of it, even a small one, (s)he must make sure it fits the rest of the artwork. All artwork should inherit colors from the logo and/or a color theme selected for a theme.

===== Color palette =====

=== Keywords ===

Keywords for the artwork are: ''sharp'', ''elegant'', vibrant and slick. An artist should always consider, how these keywords show in the artwork. The most important thing is, however, that the artwork resembles Xubuntu, so any artist should also follow his or her personal judgement on the artwork.

=== Artwork reusability and flexibility ===

To make the most out of artwork, it should be easily modified or used again in a different environment. That's why we suggest all of the artists to do as much of the work in '''vector formats'''. Graphics for web should of course be exported to applicable formats, but it would be ideal that the source material was available in vector format.

We suggest Inkscape as an artwork editor and SVG as the preferred format.
