=== GDM login proposal ===

=== GTK+ & Xfwm themes ===

==== Greybird ====
To test the new greybird theme, please <nowiki>[[http://shimmerproject.org/projects/greybird-aka-bluebird-colors/ |download its latest release]]</nowiki>. After the download, please extract the folder.
Then copy or move the "greybird" folder itself to either <code> /home/$USER/.themes/ </code> (create that directory if it doesn't exist) or with super-user-rights (via terminal with a leading "sudo") to <code> /usr/share/themes/ </code>.
You will then be able to select '''greybird''' in ''Settings Manager'' -> ''Appearance'' and ''Settings Manager'' -> ''Window Manager''.

Please contact ochosi on irc.freenode.net '''#xubuntu-devel''' or '''#shimmer''' to report any issues you have with both the gtk (the one from Appearance) and the xfwm4 (Window-Manager) theme. You may also send an email to the <nowiki>[[mailto: xubuntu-devel@lists.ubuntu.com | xubuntu-devel mailing list]]</nowiki> concerning issues on any of the artwork, themes, or icons. 

* A list of open issues with the icons: http://wiki.knome.fi/shimmer:greybird

=== Icons ===

==== elementary ====
It seems decided that for this release we stick to elementary for different reasons - mainly upstream cooperation and consistency.
Ochosi is working hard to make elementary xfce-complete, if you find issues with xfce/xubuntu missing icons feel free to contact him via irc.freenode.net '''#xubuntu-devel''' or '''#shimmer'''.

==== deprecated: Faenza-xfce ====
To test the new icon set, you will need to <nowiki>[[http://shimmerproject.org/hg/faenza-xfce |download]]</nowiki> and install them. Choose '''gz''' on the left, that should start the download manager. After extracting, you will find a folder labeled "icons" inside the extracted folder. Please rename that to "faenza-xfce", then copy or move it to either <code> /home/$USER/.themes/ </code> (create that directory if it doesn't exist) or with super-user-rights (via terminal with a leading "sudo") to <code> /usr/share/icons </code>. You can then choose '''faenza-xfce''' in Settings Manager -> Appearance -> Icons. 

Please contact ochosi on irc.freenode.net '''#xubuntu-devel''' or '''#shimmer''' to report any issues you have with these. You may also send an email to the <nowiki>[[mailto: xubuntu-devel@lists.ubuntu.com | xubuntu-devel mailing list]]</nowiki> concerning issues on any of the artwork, themes, or icons.
