''DapperXubuntuLook''
== Final propositions ==
Due to the final Ubuntu usplash propositions, a new Xubuntu splash screen has been made. Please vote on which one should be included by default in Xubuntu.

* ''Viper550'' : Wow, that looks alot like mine! Awesome! (votes for it)
* ''Add your vote here.''

* ''<nowiki>[[Michiel3]]</nowiki>:'' I feel that consistency is very important. Edubuntu and Ubuntu will have its usplash in this style. That's why I think it's important to keep Xubuntu in this style as well. (Note: don't count this as a vote, since I'm the one who made it, and the other person isn't around to vote for his own usplash.)
* AdamConrad: I like this one, both for consistency's sake, and because Michiel managed to make the mouse actually look like a mouse in the logo, which is rather nice.  +1 from me.
* JaniMonoses: I like this better as well since it resembles ubuntu and edubuntu splashes.+1
* Luzi: I vote for this one, too, because it looks very shiny and 'polished', which goes perfectly with dapper's goal. I'm going to try it now on my system to see how it looks with text. Update: I've tried it and it looks really good!
* mrelectron: +1
* LukasSabota +1
* VincentZekred +1, love it :D
* Suppaman +1, my vote too.

this is a tweaked version of the default with different text colors (don't use red for 'ok')

==== Comments ====
It does not really fit a general Xfce or Xubuntu theme, but some might like it as it is. -- VincentZekred
