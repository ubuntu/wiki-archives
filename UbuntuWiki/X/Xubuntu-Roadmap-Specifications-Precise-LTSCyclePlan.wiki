=== Detailed specification ===

The plan for Xubuntu LTS cycles is:
* 3-year LTS cycles
* Milestone image testing i386/amd64 (including point release updates post release)
* Best effort High/Critical bug fixes
* Best effort security fixes for Xfce related packages

=== Comments ===

* This would be made easier if Xubuntu Precise would be aligned with Debian for their Wheezy release with the same base Xfce version.  With a proposed March 2012 release date for 4.10, it's possible that Debian could move to that release before their freeze during the summer. --- micahg
* The plan is accepted by Technical Board. --- knome
