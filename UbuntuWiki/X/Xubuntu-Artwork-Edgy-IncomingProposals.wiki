== GTK Theme ==

Viper550:

Just whipped up a nice new GTK theme for Xubuntu using the Murrine engine, since the theme choice on Dapper (Clearlooks) seemed a bit dissapointing.

Pyrotica:

My GTK theme based on the clearlooks engine. (fonts in screenshot are larger than they appear.)

== Comments ==

While these are very nice, can we come up with a more basic 2D design? I feel that a 2D design is often more classic.

I like Splash v3, Logo v3, and GDM v1 the best so far...although GDM v5's pretty nifty too ;) Great work guys! -Derick_eisenhardt 2006-07-30@12:20CDT

I'm going to miss seeing that rat running in the treadmill. (by JeffreyCo August 5, 2006 Saturday, 9:44PM PDT)

Splash v3 and GDM v5 are my choices. --<nowiki>[[DanielTChen]]</nowiki> 09 Aug

The mouse running in the treadmill is the best bit of Xubuntu art by miles - it's really distinctive. These seem to be less interesting and have a bad case of shiny plastic.. CarolineFord 26 Oct 06
