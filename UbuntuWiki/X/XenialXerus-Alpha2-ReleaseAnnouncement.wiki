The second alpha of the Xenial Xerus (to become 16.04) has now been
released!

This alpha features images for Lubuntu, Ubuntu MATE,
Ubuntu Kylin and the Ubuntu Cloud images.

Pre-releases of the Xenial Xerus are *not* encouraged for anyone
needing a stable system or anyone who is not comfortable running
into occasional, even frequent breakage. They are, however,
recommended for Ubuntu flavor developers and those who want to
help in testing, reporting and fixing bugs as we work towards getting
this release ready.

Alpha 2 includes a number of software updates that are ready for wider
testing. This is quite an early set of images, so you should expect some
bugs.

While these Alpha 2 images have been tested and work, except as noted in
the release notes, Ubuntu developers are continuing to improve the
Xenial Xerus. In particular, once newer daily images are available,
system installation bugs identified in the Alpha 2 installer should be
verified against the current daily image before being reported in
Launchpad. Using an obsolete image to re-report bugs that have already
been fixed wastes your time and the time of developers who are busy 
trying to make 16.04 the best Ubuntu release yet. Always ensure your
system is up to date before reporting bugs.
