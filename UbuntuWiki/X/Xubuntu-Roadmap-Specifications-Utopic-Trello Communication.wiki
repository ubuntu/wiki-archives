=== Detailed specification ===

The detailed specification should go here.

Areas covered in the specification should be the following (where applicable):
* '''Summary:''' The team should use a method to enable more detailed communication of issues arising
* '''Rationale:''' At various points during the T Cycle - it took longer to find out the status of an 'issue' than to actually do anything with regard to the 'issue' A case in point, during the last weeks of the cycle brainwash, ochosi and elfy were looking at the suspend with lid-close bug - more time was spent catching up on what had been done - and then redoing tests than was necessary. Blueprints work for general statements of fact but are no real use for detail.
* '''Use cases:''' Lists within the board itself could be setup for QA, Docs, Development and any others of use. A Single Done board would suffice for all Done items. This is in addition to the current blueprint system.
* '''Detailed application comparison''' Currently we ask people what the status is of an 'issue' - if they are about, or hope that someone else is aware, or guess, or wait. Looking at a board to check status would be a more efficient use of our time. For a view of how another flavour is using trello - Kubuntu's 14.04 board can be found <nowiki>[[https://trello.com/b/s8tG9Zlf/14-04 |here ]]</nowiki> and for 14.10 their board is <nowiki>[[https://trello.com/b/fNxJO1Ac/14-10 |here]]</nowiki>
* '''Notes on design, implementation and maintenance work''' Board would need initial setup once a cycle, members of '-team' would need a trello account to access it.
