__TOC__

Xubuntu 8.10, codenamed the "Intrepid Ibex", is the next release of Xubuntu, scheduled to be released in October 2008. It integrates the latest Xfce-desktop releases with the high-quality and feature-rich core of Ubuntu, resulting in a light-weight and easy-to-use Linux distribution.

It introduces a new ready to use VNC remote viewer, the xfce4 dictionary application for ease in word spelling and definitions and incremental improvements to familiar applications.

Xubuntu 8.10 includes Xfce 4.4.2, featuring the latest round of bug-fixes from the steadily-improving Xfce4 desktop environment.

The new version brings an improved application selection, including a more powerful client for VNC. The !GpicView image viewer provides a cleaner and more functional interface than the image viewer it replaces, Ristretto. It also offers the latest in web-browsing software, shipping version 3.0.3 of Firefox, Xubuntu's default web browser. The movie player, Totem, now includes a plugin to view free digital content from the <nowiki>[[http://www.bbc.co.uk/|BBC]]</nowiki>.

A new wallpaper is also included. It is hoped that a new boot theme, GTK theme and icon theme will also make it into the final release, however, they are not yet packaged with this beta release.

Version 8.10 also ships version 0.7 of NetworkManager with several highly anticipated features such as:

*** system wide settings (i.e., no need to log in in order to get a connection)
*** management of 3G connections (GSM/CDMA)
*** management of multiple active devices at once
*** management of PPP and PPPOE connections
*** management of devices with static IP configurations
*** route management for devices

Furthermore, Dell's <nowiki>[[http://linux.dell.com/dkms|DKMS]]</nowiki> (Dynamic Kernel Module Support) is included, which allows new kernel drivers to be rebuilt without having to wait for rebuilds of driver packages.

Finally, Ben Collins added a "Last successful boot" option to the boot loader. Thus, a copy of the running copy is preserved and will be available in case a newer kernel fails to boot. It also allows for older kernels to be automatically removed safely as opposed to being retained indefinitely.
