* Team Updates
** xubuntu-core seed changes have been merged, task is installable now and the package will be installable next xubuntu-meta upload
** Notes about testing from 6/3 meeting:
** Very little package testing being done
** Images currently uninstallable
** marketing flyer completion is still pending, content is done, we just need to line up sides for printing
** Image was uninstallable up until 6/10 - nothing has been done, no testing calls went out - normal service appears to have resumed
** ochosi is working towards replacing light-locker-settings with settings in xfce4-power-manager. Might or might not happen for 14.10 though.
** bluesabre is preparing to apply for upload-rights to the xubuntu package-set
** ACTION: Team leads should try to finalize their blueprints for Utopic until the next meeting (in two weeks) so the release-team can ack them.
