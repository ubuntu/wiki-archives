'''Xubuntu team report for January, 2010'''

This has been our best month ever.

===== Packaging, Development, & Testing =====
* Testing of the new LTS, Lucid Lynx, is continuing on schedule. 

===== Artwork and marketing =====

===== Documentation =====
* Jim has begun work on Xubuntu docs, ported off of Ubuntu docs.  The bzr branch is located <nowiki>[[https://code.launchpad.net/~jwcampbell/xubuntu-docs/lucid-experimental|here]]</nowiki>, and will be merged to the current Xubuntu doc branch once stable. Conservatively, this will be ready within the next two weeks.
* Once that is done, Jim will need help from Pasi to work on the CSS theming and the landing page.

===== Team Governance =====
* The team met in early January to discuss team governance.  A detailed framework was established, but it is not yet finalized.  This will require follow-up.
