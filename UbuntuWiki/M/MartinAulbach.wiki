__TOC__

Hello, I'm a 26-year old postgraduate student from Germany currently residing in Tokyo, Japan. My primary operating system is Ubuntu. I've used SuSE and Debian before, but they both didn't reach my needs.

I'm not very expericenced with Linux, but I'd like to contribute to the Ubuntu-Project wherever possible. With my little knowledge of Japanane, I could also help with Japan-related issues.

Currently, I'm working on the translation of two Wiki-Pages of the German Ubuntu Documentation (ubuntuusers.de) into English. The first one is a install how-to for the LAPACK++ library and the second one explains how to make extra use of Cedega in combination with a Windows on a dual boot system.

ようこそ！

私は26歳で、東京に住んでいるドイツ人です。コンピュータで主にUbuntuを使います。Linuxでそんなに上手ではないですが、可能性があれば、日本のフォーラムでもお世話をしたいですが。どうぞよろしくお願いします。
