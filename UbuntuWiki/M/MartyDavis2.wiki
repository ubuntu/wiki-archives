=== About Me ===

I'm a 23-year-old guy from Tucson, AZ who has had a hot and steamy on again, off again relationship with Linux distributions since my early teens. All of my computer knowledge is self-taught, but I would consider myself a power user as I have been learning how to use computers ever since I could talk. I have worked for years in my spare time doing freelance web design, graphics design, and photography. I have used the original Red Hat, Fedora Core 1-6, Slackware, Debian, and my favorite and the one I have spent the most time with, Ubuntu. I'm also extremely experienced in Windows (3.1-XP), DOS, and moderately so in MacOS. This helps how? Well, I understand where these users are coming from... and I think desktop Linux has gotten hotter than anyone expected. I also have a lot of other interests, ranging from dork to not-so-dork... I'm also an Ubuntero - where's my prize basket?
