=== Sponsorship ===
'''NEWS:''' 

''All sponsorship requests must be made by November 17th in order to allow people time to plan for travel arrangements.''

Sorry, but the deadline has passed.

=== Hostel Arrangement ===
For all people who can't afford hotel rooms and need to stay in a hostel (or enjoy the community experience of a hostel) can add
themselves to the following list. This makes booking for groups easier and probably cheaper.
People staying in a hostel (whether sponsored or not): 
* JoshKress 
* AndreaAbelli 
* Amaya Rodrigo 
* Jeroen van Wolffelaar doesn't mind a hostel
* Corey Burger
* Carlos Garnacho doesn't mind a hostel
* Ian Lawrence
* Tuomas Santakallio
* Victor Micordia
