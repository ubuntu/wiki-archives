=== Synopsis ===

One topic of discussion was how we could get an audio meeting as all or part of LoCo meetings.

There are free SIP conference lines available by calling sip:1222???????@proxy01.sipphone.com, where the ?s are any 7 digit number you pick, with a SIP client.  One person picks these numbers, calls in, and the conference is created.  He/she then tells the rest of the folks this number, which they then dial with their favorite SIP client, and all are connected into the call.

We've used it with the Wayne State Univ. LUG with much success.  (If you don't know what client to use, I can recommend <nowiki>[[http://www.gnomemeeting.org/|ekiga]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[http://www.linphone.org/|linphone]]</nowiki> - linphone even has a command line version that works just fine, linphonec.)

More will be done soon-ish.
