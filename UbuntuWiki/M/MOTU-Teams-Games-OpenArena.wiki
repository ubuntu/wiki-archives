=== Comments ===

Interestingly enough, this aims to be a complete set of Quake 3 Arena data.  What this means is that we can likely get any Free Q3A mods or TCs and package them with Open Arena as a base.  These mods normally rely on standard Quake 3 Arena, but we can't ship those files; if they work on Open Arena, we open up a lot of options.

Added 03-12-2006 by AzraelNightwalker:
Today OpenArena released version 0.6.0. It is playable, it includes Icculus Quake3 game engine so we can package it for Ubuntu.
