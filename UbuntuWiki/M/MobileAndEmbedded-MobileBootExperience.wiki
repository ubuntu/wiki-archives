=== Mobile Boot Experience ===

==== Drawbacks of current system ====

* Random text
* USplash begins with a stutter
* X comes up with the plain/ugly "X" (grid) -bg color
  (just add -br to the Xorg startup call to get a plain black BG (see man Xserver))

==== Ideas for improvement ====

* Plain color over boot text
* Same color with logo, then gdm
* Start X earlier so GTK elements can be used during boot
* Have kernel boot to a solid color when frame buffer is available
* Monolythic kernel so boot speed to X start can be greatly reduced
* Boot status bar of some kind to give user feedback during boot
* If login process is needed, custom skins for gdm
* Possible inclusion of the pending UME artwork/icon
* Animated boot process
* Boot process and theme matching so color schemes match
* If you know the characteristics of the frame buffer you can zcat a raw image directly to it
* 

==== Complications/Roadblocks ====
* The difference between netbook and MID use of gdm (Not used in MID)
* A solution that can easly scale across all devices that UME will be applied to.
* Spacing the apps back/throttle the boot into stages so apps are not up all at once when X starts for boot
* Kernel changes for parallel module loading may have to be backported to Hardy

==== Technical details ====
* If we know enough about the hardware, we can `cat` a uncompressed image to the frame buffer
