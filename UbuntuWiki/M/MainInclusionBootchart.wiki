== Main Inclusion Report for bootchart ==

=== Requirements ===

# ''Availability:'' http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/b/bootchart, all package
# ''Rationale:''
** Needed to profile bootcharts for the live CD, for LiveCDPerformance
 0. ''Security:''
** No CVE entries.
** No Secunia history.
** Binary runs as root, but does not have user controlled input.
** Written in Java, so buffer overflows are unlikely.
** Does not open any port.
 0. ''Quality assurance:''
** Package works out of the box without configuration.
** Active upstream.
** Does not deal with exotic hardware which we cannot support.
 0. ''Standards compliance:'' 
** Meets the <nowiki>[[http://www.pathname.com/fhs/|FHS]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[http://www.de.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/|Debian Policy]]</nowiki>
** Standard debhelper/cdbs/dbs packaging, standard patch system.
 0. ''Dependencies:''
** All in main (build-depends).
** librsvg2-bin will need to be promoted if we want the bootchart binary package promoted as well.  Source for that is in main already.
