=== Open Week -- Kubuntu is Awesome - Riddell  -- Mon, Oct 11 ===
<pre>
[17:01] <Riddell> Good afternoon all
[17:01] <Riddell> as you know, Ubuntu makes a bunch of distro variants
[17:02] <Riddell> Kubuntu is the most awesomest one
[17:02] <Riddell> it's an Ubuntu distribution based heavily on KDE Software
[17:02] <Riddell> KDE is a community making the original and best free desktop software as I expect you know
[17:03] <Riddell> on the commercially led<->community sliding scale Kubuntu is much more towards community than e.g. Ubuntu Desktop is
[17:03] <Riddell> but we're a supported project of Canonical (feel free to pay us money to support you!)
[17:04] <Riddell> many years ago KDE was born as a desktop to take over the world
[17:04] <Riddell> a few years ago the desktop was complete but it hadn't taken over the world
[17:04] <Riddell> we KDE realised it wasn't enough to be as good as the competition, you had to be better
[17:04] <Riddell> so much re-writing was done and KDE 4 was born
[17:05] <Riddell> this has been a painful process, since when you rewrite things, they get a better foundation but can lose features for users
[17:05] <Riddell> the good news is that 4.0 was released three years ago!
[17:05] <Riddell> all the little niggles and missing features compared to KDE 3 have gone
[17:05] <Riddell> so we have a very solid and innovative desktop to make a distro with
[17:05] <Riddell> that distro is Kubuntu
[17:06] <Riddell> uLinux: yes, the Kubuntu session is on
[17:06] <Riddell> 10.10 was released yesterday
[17:06] <Riddell> anyone tried it yet?
[17:06] <Riddell> (chat in #ubuntu-classroom-chat incase you hadn't got that)
[17:07] <Riddell> nobody used it yet!  now's the perfect time to try!
[17:08] <Riddell> 17:07 < uLinux> QUESTION: is kubuntu less bloated then Ubuntu?
[17:08] <Riddell> it's a full featured desktop, we try not to add unnecessary dependencies but then I expect so do Ubuntu Desktop people
[17:09] <Riddell> it all manages to fit on a single CD though, which beats any proprietary OS you can think of
[17:09] <Riddell> 17:07 < ulysses> Riddell: I upgraded but it freezes with KDE 4.5.1 and 4.5.2 also:(
[17:09] <Riddell> that's a shame, computers can be annoying like that
[17:09] <Riddell> do use #kubuntu or mailing lists or forums for support to try to debug that
[17:10] <Riddell> 17:08 < luis_lopez> QUESTION: is multitouch supported under Kubuntu?
=== nitesh is now known as mobster
[17:10] <Riddell> multitouch isn't supported currently, we'll be discussing that at the ubuntu summit in a couple of weeks, feel free to give me hardware I can test it on :)
[17:10] <Riddell> 17:09 < sebsebseb> QUESTION:  Why is Kubuntu so close to vanilla KDE, instead of customising it a bit more like other distros tend to do, themewise and such?
[17:10] <Riddell> because KDE rocks!
[17:11] <Riddell> we like to work with KDE rather than change what they offer, that way everyone wins
[17:11] <Riddell> also other distros customise the theme so you can recognise Kubuntu nicely because we're the one that doesn't :)
[17:11] <Riddell> KDE artwork is great, I don't see any reason to change it
[17:12] <Riddell> 17:10 < Guest36400> So whats the difference between Ubuntu+KDE and Kubuntu?
[17:12] <Riddell> well nothing, Kubuntu is the KDE variant from Ubuntu
[17:12] <Riddell> if you have Ubuntu Desktop installed you can get Kubuntu with just installing the kubuntu-desktop package
[17:13] <Riddell> 17:11 < shauno> (question for here) are all these sessions direct q&a? or do we let them do their bit & wait until questions are invited?
[17:13] <Riddell> shauno: I have some notes to talk from, but it's usually more interesting with questions
[17:13] <Riddell> so feel free to ask
[17:14] <Riddell> 17:09 < ls960> QUESTION: will fix intel drivers 915, 945 and so on?
[17:14] <Riddell> that's up to Intel really I'm afraid
[17:14] <Riddell> KWin uses parts of openGL that are not well supported by all X drivers unfortunately
[17:14] <Riddell> and to make things worse, some drivers claim to suppose those features when they don't
[17:15] <Riddell> this isn't new parts of openGL, it's features that have been working fine on other OSs for years
[17:15] <Riddell> but I know KDE developers will be working with X developers to make sure those problems get fixed
[17:16] <Riddell> 17:13 < crunch2> Question: why does kubuntu seem a "bit" slower then ubuntu? How can we speed up kubuntu? thks
[17:16] <Riddell> that's a tricky question to answer, it's very subjective and usually depends on the hardware you have
[17:16] <Riddell> turning off compositing may help, or it may not
[17:16] <Riddell> make sure nepomuk "Desktop Search" is turned off, that can use lots of resources
[17:17] <Riddell> 17:13 < ulysses> QUESTION: Do you plan using the upstream KDE translations instead of importing them to Launchpad, and then building the language packs, and updating more  frequently the translations?
[17:17] <Riddell> we do use upstream translations of course
[17:18] <Riddell> but as you say they get imported and exported from launchpad
[17:18] <Riddell> which can cause problems when the import/export scripts don't work
[17:18] <Riddell> unfortunately upstream KDE translations aren't perfect either
[17:18] <Riddell> they released the wrong translations for KDE PIM in this release
[17:19] <Riddell> they also won't accept strings we add to our packages (there's about a dozen of them) so we need to do translatins ourselves
[17:19] <Riddell> and Canonical has customers who need to translate Kubuntu all in one place without having to learn about svn exports and po files
[17:20] <Riddell> so I don't expect it to change, although I agree it's not perfect
[17:20] <Riddell> so new in 10.10...
[17:20] <Riddell> the Plasma Netbook workspace has been promoted onto the main Kubuntu download
[17:21] <Riddell> you now get either a netbook or a desktop workspace as best suited to your machine
[17:21] <Riddell> (you can change it manually if you want)
[17:21] <Riddell> this is part of the KDE strategy of making sure KDE Software can fit in on a spectrum of machines
[17:21] <Riddell> from handheld to large desktops
[17:21] <Riddell> along those lines we also have a new Kubuntu Mobile variant using the Plasma Mobile workspace
[17:22] <Riddell> it's very much a technology preview for now
[17:22] <Riddell> but I did see them making a phone call with it at Akademy
[17:22] <Riddell> in Kubuntu 10.10 we also have an updated package manager, now application focused (like Software Centre or App Store)
[17:23] <Riddell> ooh and a new web browser
[17:23] <Riddell> Rekonq is based on Webkit and has an innovative user interface
[17:23] <Riddell> global menu: a new freedesktop spec led by canonical has allowed for a menu bar which is in a panel rather than in the app frame
[17:24] <Riddell> we use this in the netbook workspace now
[17:24] <Riddell> the installer now lets you download MP3 support during the install
[17:24] <Riddell> it also starts the install as soon as you set your partitions, so it's ready sooner
[17:24] <Riddell> we use the new Ubuntu font by default
[17:24] <Riddell> which I think looks lovely
[17:24] <Riddell> and of course all the latest software versions, KDE Platform 4.5, Qt 4.7, Amarok 2.3.2...
[17:25] <Riddell> 17:21 < luis_lopez> QUESTION: Riddell: Tell us something about Qt Quick awesomeness :)
[17:25] <Riddell> Qt Quick is a new feature with Qt 4.7
[17:25] <Riddell> it's a library which lets you write user interfaces in a language similar to CSS stylesheets
[17:26] <Riddell> then write the transitions you want to happen in that UI when actions happen
[17:26] <Riddell> it makes writing desktop apps similar to how I believe Adobe Flash apps are written
[17:26] <Riddell> it allows for designers to gets the results they want sooner and easier
[17:26] <Riddell> we did a tutorial on it a few months ago as part of Kubuntu Tutorials Day
[17:27] <Riddell> Kubuntu developers apachelogger has been playing with writing a video playing in Qt Quick, so we may see some fancy new app in Natty
[17:27] <Riddell> 17:22 < crunch2> Question: why doesnt kubuntu receives all the goodies ubuntu is developing, such as full ubuntu one integration? thks
[17:28] <Riddell> "Ubuntu" is a project that makes distributions such as Ubuntu Desktop or Kubuntu, but there's very little software written by Ubuntu
[17:28] <Riddell> Ubuntu One is written by Canonical
[17:28] <Riddell> and they've done their sums and reconned it's not economically sensible to write Kubuntu frontends to Ubuntu One
[17:29] <Riddell> which is a shame, but that's business for you
[17:29] <Riddell> we did have a project to write them which got quite far but the Ubuntu One team in Canonical hasn't learnt how to work with the community very well yet
[17:29] <Riddell> so they made changes that stopped our bits from working
[17:30] <Riddell> we'll be talking to them about that at the Ubuntu summit
[17:30] <Riddell> 17:21 < Chell> Question: In the past Kubuntu was critiqued of not having as much spit & polish as Ubuntu. Did the Kubuntu team do anything about that for 10.10?
[17:30] <Riddell> we took the more polished KDE software and made it all work for you :)
[17:31] <Riddell> 17:26 < MyPlanetWars> QUESTION: is it possible to have both KDE and GNOME together? if yes, is it stable and which files are shared? (e.g. home directory?)
[17:31] <Riddell> yes very much
[17:31] <Riddell> there's no reason to limit yourself if you need a feature from an app
[17:31] <Riddell> all your files are shared
[17:32] <Riddell> 17:21 < boulabiar> Question: How much developers are working on KDE/Kubuntu compared to Gnome/ubuntu inside Canonical
[17:33] <Riddell> I think a better question is how many people in total work on Kubuntu compared to Ubuntu Desktop
[17:33] <Riddell> I don't know the answer to that
[17:33] <Riddell> but I do know the Kubuntu team is busy and friendly and you should come and join us
[17:34] <Riddell> (I'm avoiding the original question because I don't count how many gnome developers canonical has it's not something I spend much time looking at)
[17:35] <Riddell> here at Kubuntu we pride ourselves on being friendly
[17:35] <Riddell> friendly software, friendly people
[17:35] <Riddell> if we're ever not, do call us out on it!
[17:35] <Riddell> so we should be friendly on support channels for users, on IRC, mailing lists, forums etc
[17:35] <Riddell> and if you want to help out making Kubuntu better, we're always very friendly to that
[17:36] <Riddell> yes we want you for Kubuntu contributors!
[17:36] <Riddell> now is the start of the cycle so we have lots of things to do to get Natty going
[17:36] <Riddell> lots of packages need updating and merging with Debian
[17:36] <Riddell> lots of bugs need triaged (to find out if any stable release updates for 10.10 are needed for example)
[17:36] <Riddell> lots of users need support with 10.10 of course
[17:37] <Riddell> if you want to propose feature ideas for Natty we have UDS
[17:38] <Riddell> the Ubuntu Developer Summit
[17:38] <Riddell> which you can participate in remotely if you aren't in Florida
[17:38] <Riddell> if you are a kubuntu contributor not only do you get international recognition by millions of users
[17:38] <Riddell> you may well also get to come to the next Ubuntu Developer Summit
[17:38] <Riddell> as I say we're having one in a couple of weeks in Florida
[17:39] <Riddell> and some of the people coming were, like many of you, kubuntu users six months ago, but are now fully fledged contributors
[17:39] <Riddell> ideas for natty are being collected at http://wiki.kubuntu.org/Kubuntu/UDSNatty
[17:40] <Riddell> mostly we do our kubuntu development in #kubuntu-devel
[17:40] <Riddell> so if you're interested in helping out do join us there
[17:40] <Riddell> any more questions?
[17:40] <Riddell> or any I've missed?
[17:42] <Riddell> seems not, thanks for listening and asking, let me know if you do have questions and if you want to help with Kubuntu we're waiting for you to join us
[17:43] <Riddell> 17:42 < crunch2> Question: how tight is the cooperation with debian (kde maintainers)?
[17:43] <Riddell> we share beers at events
[17:43] <Riddell> we share patches
[17:43] <Riddell> as with Ubuntu in general we get a lot more from Debian than we give back, but we try to make sure we give back when there are changes they'll be interested in
[17:44] <Riddell> 17:44 < maco> Riddell: how do patches work between kubuntu and kde?
[17:44] <Riddell> most of our patches come from KDE upstream
[17:44] <Riddell> and most of the rest go to KDE upstream
[17:44] <Riddell> shadeslayer got his first patch into KDE today, go shadeslayer!
[17:45] <Riddell> we try to keep any long running patches to a minimum, it becomes unsustainable very quickly if we don't
[17:45] <Riddell> 17:44 < MyPlanetWars> QUESTION: besides the look, is there any difference in kubuntu and ubuntu?
[17:46] <Riddell> all the GUI programmes are different programmes
[17:46] <Riddell> so it's like asking is there any difference between Windows and MacOS, they all let you browse files and look at websites but the details are all different
[17:47] <Riddell> 17:45 < maco> qt and gtk are both LGPL
[17:47] <Riddell> that's true and worth repeating since people seem to forget
[17:48] <Riddell> the main non-technical difference between those two toolkits it Qt is actively developed by a large community and a commercial sponsor
[17:51] <ClassBot> There are 10 minutes remaining in the current session.
[17:53] <Riddell> thanks again for listening, next up it's "How to contribute to Ubuntu" with devildante
[17:54] <devildante> hi guys :)
[17:55] <jcastro> wait until the time, don't start too early!
[17:55] <devildante> okay
[17:55] <jcastro> it's like ubuntu, strict time schedule! :)
