I am originally from the island of Cebu, Philippines and now living in Baltimore, MD, USA.  I have been playing around with Linux since 1998 when a friend introduced me to Slackware.  That started neverending sleepless nights working on my computers.

Through the years I have since tried out Redhat, Slackware, Debian and finally, Ubuntu.  I have stuck with it since then.  

I am interested in helping out anyway I can.  I am currently doing some testing with my trusted laptop, an <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LaptopTestingTeam/Averatec3150H|Averatec 3150H]]</nowiki>.

I am very much interested promoting Ubuntu as desktop operating system for everyday use as well for enterprise use.  

I currently worked at Johns Hopkins IT doing support.
