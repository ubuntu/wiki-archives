== Discussion ==

From the latest <nowiki>[[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/11/10/shuttleworth_oracle/|talk of Mark to the register]]</nowiki>: on the deal between novell & microsoft:

<pre>
We haven't seen the details of the deal. Novell hasn't seen the real plan. The industry is littered with companies that have fought with Microsoft, then went to Microsoft as a cowered partner to do some small deal and then just got axed. Palm, Sybase and, um, Novell."
</pre>
It's seams that Mark is rather against such deal. But i might be wrong.
=== For ===

* I wouldn't unconditionally reject an offer purely on the basis that it was from MS. Although MS is the major competitor of Ubuntu, Ubuntu still has more in common with MS than the RIAA for example. Collaboration in certain areas, such as Wine, Samba, Xen and Colinux could be beneficial. -- JohnMccabeDansted

=== Against ===

* The money they will be offering is not worth the damages the distro will take on... -<nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/towsonu2003|towsonu2003]]</nowiki> 11/10/2006
