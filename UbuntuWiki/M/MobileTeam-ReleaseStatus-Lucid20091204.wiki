| Blueprint
| Description
| Status
|-
| <rowbgcolor="#00cc00"> UbuntuSpec:mobile-lucid-arm-gcc-v7-thumb2
| Description: We want to build the archive in lucid for the ARMv7 architecture with thumb2 support. The compiler needs to have the proper default settings when building binaies for the armel architecture.
| Pending
|-
| <rowbgcolor="#00cc00"> UbuntuSpec:mobile-lucid-imx51-debian-cd-to-uboot
| Description: Over the last two releases we used redboot-tools to create images for imx51. Freescale moves the imx51 architecture to the uboot bootloader by default now. Image build scripts and userspace maintenance tools need to be moved to uboot to comply with this change.
| Pending
|-
| <rowbgcolor="#00ff00"> UbuntuSpec:mobile-lucid-une-2d-launcher
| Description: It is desirable to have a netbook launcher that runs well on platforms that do not have accelerated OpenGL drivers for X. This blueprint attempts to detail the specifics of a 2D netbook launcher for use on these platforms.
| In&nbsp;Progress
|-
| <rowbgcolor="#00cc00"> UbuntuSpec:mobile-lucid-arm-alternate-images
| Description: This spec tracks the status and discussion of making alternate images fully supported by the Ubuntu armel porting team.
| Pending
|-
| <rowbgcolor="#00cc00"> UbuntuSpec:mobile-lucid-arm-device-tree-support
| Description: Device tree's are a mechanism to pass hardware configuration data to the operating system. Currently ARM Linux uses the mach-type method to figure out device details but this is cumbersome for the ever-increasing number of board variants and it doesn't hold data about attached peripherals. Using device trees could simplify board ports and reduce platform specific code.
| Pending
|-
| <rowbgcolor="#00ff00"> UbuntuSpec:mobile-lucid-arm-lib-tests
| Description: This blueprint is designed to explore the possibility of using existing tests within the Linux Standards Base to test new architecture level builds of libraries on arm processors, as well as other ideas for testing to ensure library api's don't break.
| In&nbsp;Progress
|-
| <rowbgcolor="#00cc00"> UbuntuSpec:mobile-lucid-arm-lightweightbrowser
| Description: Mozilla is a fairly heavy web browser and suffers from less than optimal performance on ARM due to issues such as cache size.  Lighter-weight web browsers should be investigated, and a more appropriate one should be picked as a default for ARM based releases.
| Pending
|-
| <rowbgcolor="#00cc00"> UbuntuSpec:mobile-lucid-arm-per-soc-powermanagement
| Description: How do we make sure our kernels support all powermanagement features on specific ARM SoCs Make sure necessary changes in userspace get in place
| Pending
|-
| <rowbgcolor="#00cc00"> UbuntuSpec:mobile-lucid-bringup-testing
| [plars] drafted [asac 25-11-09] some (very) minor adjustments done to spec; approved.
| Pending
|-
| <rowbgcolor="#00cc00"> UbuntuSpec:mobile-lucid-arm-une
| Description: This specification is talk about the possibility of a cut-down UNE for ARM based SoCs.
| Pending
|-
| <rowbgcolor="#00cc00"> UbuntuSpec:mobile-lucid-arm-suspend-resume-testplan
| Description: Work out proper testplan to catch all suspend/hibernate and resume issues on ARM hardware
| Pending
|-
| <rowbgcolor="#00cc00"> UbuntuSpec:mobile-lucid-arm-alternate-media-client
| Description: The current video media client, totem, does not take effective advantage of ARM media processing capabilities or resize video well for presentation on netbook screens, and hence may detract from the overall ARM smartbook media experience.  There have been several alternate media streaming applications proposed, which need to be investigated.  Some are not in our repository currently.  Related to this are problems with f-spot and Mono consuming battery life on ARM devices, and at least one of the options proposed may allow elimination of that application as well.
| Pending
|-
| <rowbgcolor="#00cc00"> UbuntuSpec:mobile-lucid-arm-debian-cd-cleanup
| Description: There is relatively high code duplication between the imx51 and dove backends for armel image creation, this spec exists to track cleanup and recoding of this backend code to be cleaner and easier to manage.
| Pending
|-
| <rowbgcolor="#00cc00"> UbuntuSpec:mobile-lucid-arm-rootstock-gui
| Description: Integrate rootstock with a gui for preselecting options and integrate the second stage of the build with ubiquity/oem-config
| Pending
|-
| <rowbgcolor="#00cc00"> UbuntuSpec:mobile-lucid-efficient-install-testing
| Description: The number of images to test is increasing rapidly, and some images require specific hardware which is not widely available in the community.  These factors make it impractical to do exhaustive testing of install images.  However, adequate coverage must still be acheived in order to ensure the quality of milestone images.
| Pending
|-
| <rowbgcolor="#00cc00"> UbuntuSpec:mobile-lucid-lxde-goals
| Description: This blueprint is likely to be informational only and primarily to help consolidate tracking of community efforts in LXDE and Lubuntu for Lucid.  It is also proposed for the Lucid UDS because some LXDE core developers will be present.
| Pending
|-
| <rowbgcolor="#00cc00"> UbuntuSpec:mobile-lucid-une-casper-speedup
| Description: Investigate whether it is possible to clean-up and speed-up the casper boot process for live-cd images. Currently live-cd's boot slower on ARM than on x86 and this spec is to discover what the bottle necks are and to come up with solutions to fix them.
| Pending
|-
| <rowbgcolor="#00cc00"> UbuntuSpec:mobile-lucid-arm-softboot-loader
| Blocked on kexec on ARM.
| Pending
|-
| <rowbgcolor="#00cc00"> UbuntuSpec:mobile-lucid-arm-webservice-for-email
| Description: It has been proposed that both evolution and thunderbird performs poorly on ARM for UNE (and desktop), and that there is no suitable alternative available in our repository. For this reason it has been suggested not to install an email client on UNE desktops as part of the default applications, but rather offer a link or bookmark to google documents, or a splash application that offers such a link or the option for the user to add openoffice if they choose.  Many now use web based email, so it may not be critical to find a suitable application for this for the default installation.
| Pending
|-
| <rowbgcolor="#00cc00"> UbuntuSpec:mobile-lucid-arm-webservice-for-office
| Description: It has been proposed that openoffice performs poorly on ARM for UNE (and desktop), and that there is no suitable alternative in the repository.  For this reason it has been suggested not to install OpenOffice on UNE desktops as part of the default applications, but rather offer a link or bookmark to google documents, or a splash application that offers such a link or the option for the user to add openoffice if they choose.

|-
| <rowbgcolor="#00cc00"> UbuntuSpec:mobile-lucid-arm-ext-images
| Need to benchmark extX image speed on ARM based SoCs
| Pending
|-
| <rowbgcolor="#00cc00"> UbuntuSpec:mobile-lucid-arm-kernel-versions
| Description: This spec is informational only to discuss the current and long term ARM kernel for the Lucid cycle
