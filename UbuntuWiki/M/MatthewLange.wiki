Hi guys!

I've made the jump to Linux on the Desktop full-time with Kubuntu.

I currently have:
* Ubuntu Server Edition on an MSNTV2 as a fileserver
* Kubuntu Jaunty and Kubuntu Karmic (from Alpha 6) on my Desktop
* Kubuntu Jaunty on my Acer Aspire 3003 WLMi
* [http://eeebuntu.org/index.php?page=nbr|Eeebuntu Jaunty Netbook Remix] on my ASUS [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EeePC|EeePC] 702 (8GB SSD)

I contribute to the LaptopTestingTeam: I test out K/Eee/Ubuntu features such as sound, video, wireless, etc. on my laptops and report the results.
