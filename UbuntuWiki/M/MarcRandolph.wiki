=== Areas of contribution ===
* Free up developers and maintainers by
** triaging bugs (especially getting bugs forwarded upstream in a timely manner)
** answering questions as time permits on #ubuntu-mythtv, #ubuntu-bugs, and in the <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/index.php|Ubuntu Forums]]</nowiki>
* Test upgrades and upcoming releases of Mythbuntu and Ubuntu
* Generating patches for (minor) bug fixes
* Lot of random things over the years.  Most recently documenting what it takes to get a Gyration remote working

=== Goals ===
* Increase bug fixing ability (and ability to contribute new features back to Mythbuntu, and MythTV [especially Mythweb]), by learning more Python, Perl, and C++
* Become proficient at PPA and other launchpad build related items
* Become less frustrated at how launchpad and loggerhead seem to get in the way and hide things (by learning how they work and hopefully help to improve them)
