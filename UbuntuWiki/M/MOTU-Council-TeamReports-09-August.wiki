* MC Meeting 2009-08-14,
** We are very happy to have Julien Lavergne (gilir) join the MOTU team. His great work in Ubuntu and great passion for collaborating with Debian made the decision very easy.
** Yulia Novozhilova was recommended for upload privileges for `netbeans` (and related packages). We're very happy to have somebody new being very active with Java-related packages!
** Andy Whitcroft was recommended for upload prileges for the Kernel. His great work clearly spoke for himself. :-)
