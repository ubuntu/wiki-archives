Ubuntu Mobile is a flavour of Ubuntu that has been customised for use on handhelds (MIDs) and sub-notebook PCs (e.g. Eee).  Ubuntu Mobile is primarily based on Ubuntu Desktop, with interface changes to improve the user experience on small screens.

Ubuntu Mobile is new, and growing.  Anyone with interest in this target is encouraged to join the team and help create what may become the basis of future mobile device interaction.  If you have any questions, feel free to ask in #ubuntu-mobile on freenode, or contact the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-mobile|Ubuntu Mobile Team]]</nowiki> on our <nowiki>[[mailto:ubuntu-mobile@lists.ubuntu.com|Mailing List]]</nowiki>

Some of the ways in which you can help include:

== Testing ==
If you would like to get involved with Ubuntu Mobile Edition by testing our releases or adding to our test cases and plans. Please see <nowiki>[[Testing/Cases/UMEdesktop]]</nowiki> for a step by step process for improving the testing of Ubuntu Mobile.

== Development ==
If you would like get involved with Ubuntu Mobile by fixing existing defects, adding new features, or submitting new applications for inclusion, please review the information in this section.

=== Fixing Existing Defects ===
Known defects are available from https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-mobile .  If you are able to identify a solution, please post a patch or clear description of the solution.  There are also a number of bugs in the underlying packages, found in the regular <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu|Ubuntu Bugtracker]]</nowiki>, which should be addressed through existing Ubuntu processes (see HelpingWithBugs).

=== Adding New Features ===
 1. '''Create a blueprint'''
Use the following template
{{{
Descriptions:
Technical Details:
How will it be implemented:
Testcases for accessing new features:
How was it implemented:
Additional Comments:}}}

 2. '''Reviewed and Improved by Committee'''
Committee made up of diverse group designed to review specs and fill in details required from their experience. 

 3. '''Blueprint assigned''' 
Once the committee agrees on the level of detail a spec "Driver" is assigned from among the volunteers.

 4. ''' Blueprint is targeted to a Milestone'''
A time frame for implementation is determined by the driver, and set in the blueprint

 5. '''Milestone is reached '''
When the target milestone is reached the testcases provided in the blueprint are added to the case suite and is executed by the test team.

 6. '''Post Milestone'''
After target milestone any defects discovered are handled like any other bug.

If the target milestone is reached and the blueprint has not been implemented, bugs will be entered against the missing features and assigned tasks for implementation.

=== Submitting new applications for inclusion ===
If you have identified an application as being sufficiently well-integrated with the Ubuntu Mobile environment to warrant inclusion by default, either directly or as a replacement for an existing application, file a bug against the ubuntu-mobile package specifying the package and the rationale for inclusion.  To ease acceptance, please also provide the information requested by UbuntuMainInclusionRequirements.  While not every package in Ubuntu Mobile is in main, this report includes much of the information interesting for any application to be supported by default.
