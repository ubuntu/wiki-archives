__TOC__

This is a (yet primitive) log of my journey towards becoming a MOTU. After a long time of reading the documentation on and off, as well as lurking on the mailing lists and IRC channel, I've finally <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-motu-mentors/2008-February/000245.html|posted]]</nowiki> to ubuntu-motu-mentors and formally started working, by fixing small bugs. 

So far I've submitted three debdiffs, one of which has been uploaded. I intend to do some more before getting into packaging from scratch.
