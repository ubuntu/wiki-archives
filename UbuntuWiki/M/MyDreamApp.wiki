We've all seen the success of the MyDreamApp(http://mydreamapp.com/) competition for Macintosh recently and I was wondering maybe if we could replicate that for Linux. It would be the quest for the KILLER linux software. Any developer would be eligible as long as he codes for Linux and uses GPL.

Finally open source devs who want ideas heard can get them heard. And we would all be benifitting with a great app at the end. And it would all be promoting the use of Linux and FOSS. 

This idea probably needs to be worked on a little more. I'm not even sure if this is the right place for suggestions but I've posted it anyways. What do you think people ?
