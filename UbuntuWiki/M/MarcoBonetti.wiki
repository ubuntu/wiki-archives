Hi! I'm a majoring CS student at the <nowiki>[[http://www.polimi.it/|Politecnico di Milano]]</nowiki>.
(Actually I've already had a (level 1) major in CS, but this is just our italian system which is really strange)

I like working with linux and other *nix OSes, writing scripts and helping people out.

I'm a Darwin Ports mantainer for Mindless Automaton and for the Fink Project.

I wish to help ubuntu project as a part-time maintainer.

Packages I'm interested in:
* Mindless Automaton, obviously ;)
* an ssh tunnel gui?
* an update version of drivel

Whatever else?
I keep a small <nowiki>[[http://www.livejournal.com/~sid77/|blog]]</nowiki> and I like <nowiki>[[http://tankboy.altervista.org/_altervista_ht/bonzocignalo.jpg|warthogs]]</nowiki>... ;)
