=== MOTU Leadership Teams selection process ===

<nowiki>[[CodySomerville|Cody Somerville]]</nowiki> brought the discussion about selecting MOTU Leadership teams for discussion at the meeting, asking which electoral system was desired.  After wide-ranging discussion, it was determined that no clear decision could be taken on many related topics withouth further discussion and clarification.  <nowiki>[[StefanPotyra|Stefan Potyra]]</nowiki> volunteered to summarise the ideas in the email thread and meeting for further review on the mailing list.

The Next MOTU Meeting will be 25th July 2008, 20:00 UTC.
