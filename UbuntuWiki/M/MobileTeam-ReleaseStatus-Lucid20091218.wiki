| Description: Over the last two releases we used redboot-tools to create images for imx51. Freescale moves the imx51 architecture to the uboot bootloader by default now. Image build scripts and userspace maintenance tools need to be moved to uboot to comply with this change.

|-
| <rowbgcolor="#4c9100"> UbuntuSpec:mobile-lucid-arm-lightweightbrowser
| Description: Mozilla is a fairly heavy web browser and suffers from less than optimal performance on ARM due to issues such as cache size.  Lighter-weight web browsers should be investigated, and a more appropriate one should be picked as a default for ARM based releases.

| <rowbgcolor="#4c9100"> UbuntuSpec:mobile-lucid-efficient-install-testing
| Description: The number of images to test is increasing rapidly, and some images require specific hardware which is not widely available in the community.  These factors make it impractical to do exhaustive testing of install images.  However, adequate coverage must still be acheived in order to ensure the quality of milestone images.

| <rowbgcolor="#4c9100"> UbuntuSpec:mobile-lucid-arm-webservice-for-email
| Description: It has been proposed that both evolution and thunderbird performs poorly on ARM for UNE (and desktop), and that there is no suitable alternative available in our repository. For this reason it has been suggested not to install an email client on UNE desktops as part of the default applications, but rather offer a link or bookmark to google documents, or a splash application that offers such a link or the option for the user to add openoffice if they choose.  Many now use web based email, so it may not be critical to find a suitable application for this for the default installation.

| Description: It has been proposed that openoffice performs poorly on ARM for UNE (and desktop), and that there is no suitable alternative in the repository.  For this reason it has been suggested not to install OpenOffice on UNE desktops as part of the default applications, but rather offer a link or bookmark to google documents, or a splash application that offers such a link or the option for the user to add openoffice if they choose.
