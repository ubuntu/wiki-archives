== About Me ==
Hello!
My name is Mehmet Basaran. I am a member of the Kernel Team at Canonical.

== What I do ==
I joined the Kernel Team at Canonical in 04/2024.
I am working on releasing kernels as a part of the stable team. I have the usual responsibilities such as cranking, ML review, hinting and some extra duties which come with the stable team (like helping team close off past cycles).
Additionally, I am working on kernel test result viewing tool with the TNT team.
