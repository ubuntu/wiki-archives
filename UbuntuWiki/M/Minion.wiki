=== About Me ===
Just to be quick I wanted to let everyone know I am basically interested in Computer Programming. I have been a hardcore Windows user for pretty much a majority of my life. I recently took a job at a computer repair store and I learned what Open Source truly was. I am excited to have found this community and excited to see where this takes me.
