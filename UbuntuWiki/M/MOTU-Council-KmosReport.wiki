| #ubuntu-motu
| Had a discussion with kmos about why he was doing things he agreed that he wouldn't do.  Apparently he was modifying MOTU sync requests because archive admins ignore unconfirmed bugs, and/or marking them as wishlist "so they would appear higher up in the list", to get done faster.  Appears to have no concept of patience, with 2 days being too long for him to wait for a sync request to be done.  He says that sync requests are important, (presumably as are removals, overrides, and everything else that appears on the archive admin list). Promises he won't do it again, but he said that last time.

| Kmos attempted to be helpful by giving me links to a debian security advisory when I was working on a security upload. Although the first link he gave was 404 and the second one I had already found, I appreciated the gesture.

| Hobbsee
| #ubuntu-devel
| Decided to attempt to hijack discussion about apt showing reverse depends of virtual packages, by asking if i'd tried $random command.  Source packages with different names to their binaries are not virtual packages, so i've no idea how he thought his stuff was relevant.  Apparently he thought that it worked in the same way.  Clearly he didn't test out what he was attempting to help with first.  When I confronted him on this, he didn't say much, only that it "maybe" had no relevance, and then claimed he had to go for a job interview.

| Initial request to unsubscribe u-a was correct.  However, I then ack'd the bug, and marked it as triaged, in the hope that u-u-s (which I now can't unsubscribe) would ignore it.  He decided it was appropriate to go and revert my change (setting it back to confirmed).  He has been told that it's inappropriate for him to go and revert changes that a MOTU has done (again), and says he will not do it again.

| Attempted to fix a bug which caused a loop that occupied palmer for several days, until IS killed the build. Requested others test a broken patch in #ubuntu-motu and #ubuntu-devel prior to self testing.  Agreed to test and try to fix.  Further discussion on #ubuntu-motu indicated an upload to PPA with the expectation that the build would fail.  The build didn't fail, but luckily the buildd crashing bug was not exposed.  Channel discussion requesting justification for this was incomplete, due to external scheduling.  Further investigation and testing planned.  See #ubuntu-motu log for 28th December 13:00 - 14:00 UTC for full transcript of further discussion. (LaserJock) Uploaded after proper debdiff was provided and consulting with Fujitsu
