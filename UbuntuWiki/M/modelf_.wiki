=== About Me ===
Hello, my name is Chris. I've been using Ubuntu for about a year now, and I figure it's time to stop using the Ubuntu community as a resource, and start engaging it as the process it really is. I'm excited to begin contributing to a community that has helped me for a long time, and inspire new users to have the same rich experience I have been having. That said, I'm still new and looking for ways to expand my knowledge and collaborate in new ways.  

=== My Involvement with the Ubuntu Community ===

Currently, I am under the mentorship of <nowiki>[[zkriesse]]</nowiki> for the Ubuntu Beginners Team
