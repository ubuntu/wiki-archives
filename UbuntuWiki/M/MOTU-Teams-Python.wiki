__TOC__

This MOTU team cares for <nowiki>[[http://www.python.org|Python]]</nowiki> application and modules packaged in universe.

=== Packages ===

We care for the numerous packages that use python in universe, chiefly python modules & extensions.

    ''The ruby team has packaged RubyOnRails for Ubuntu, do we also package TurboGears and <nowiki>[[Django]]</nowiki> to let the people have good pythonic alternatives to it? (if RubyOnRails have a special debtag, use it also for these)''

    Yes. Turbogears is packaged as python-turbogears. Django is packaged as python-django.

Most packages come to Ubuntu from Debian.  You can (and should) work with Debian to get new packages and Ubuntu fixes into Debian.  See the <nowiki>[[http://python-modules.alioth.debian.org/|Debian Python Modules]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[http://wiki.debian.org/Teams/PythonAppsPackagingTeam|Debian Python Application Packaging]]</nowiki> Teams are very open to contributions from Ubuntu.  See <nowiki>[[Debian-PythonModulesTeam]]</nowiki> for details.
