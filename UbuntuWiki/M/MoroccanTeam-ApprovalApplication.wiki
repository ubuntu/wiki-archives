== Approval Application for Ubuntu Morocco (ubuntu-ma)  اوبونتو المغرب ==

The Ubuntu Morocco team seeks to be recognized as the official Morocco Loco Team.

The team, which has been active for more than 2 years, consists of Ubuntu users from all over Morocco and Moroccans living abroad. Our varied membership reflects the diversity of  the spoken languages in Morocco: Moroccan Arabic, Berber (more than 3 variants), French and Spanish.

For us, giving Ubuntu love and support doesn't stop at Morocco's border. Many team members also participate in other groups on Launchpad such as Ubuntu, Documentation Team, French and Arabic translators, BugSquad and so on.

In addition to that, special meetings around Ubuntu will be organized in order to demonstrate the advantages of this distribution and make it known to the world. In several occasions, we distributed Ubuntu CDs to the attendees of our events and most of them returned positive feedback.

Some meetings are organized on the #ubuntu-ma channel:
