== Who I am ==
I'm a student at UCL (Louvain-la-Neuve - Belgium) and a member of the Cairo-Dock team and other projects which support Free Software.

== My Ubuntu story ==
I've been using Ubuntu (from the alphas to the stable Ubuntu x86_64 releases) as my primary OS since 2008 after having tested Mandrake, Mandriva and Ubuntu Warty (with its great and famous liveCD) and used Debian Etch 64bits (just after its release in April 2007).

=== My involvement ===
I'm posting and fixing bug reports on the development release for 3+ years.
I'm improving the Ubuntu official packages of Cairo-Dock 2.0 (plug-ins included) since September 2009.
I joined the Louvain-li-Nux association (promotion of Free Software through Ubuntu's installations, weekly supports to the community and event's organizations) 2 years ago.
I joined the UDS-M for one day.

=== Examples of my work / Things I'm proud of ===
A short list:
* Developing the Cairo-Dock project of course :) . During these years, I mainly improved the user experience; maintain the installation process; support Launchpad tools (Code, Bugs, Translations, Answer, Blueprint); support new changes on used APIs; create useless applets as Impulse: <nowiki>[[http://youtu.be/9WNodluOc3o]]</nowiki> ;)
* Packaging the Cairo-Dock project (weekly PPA and stable PPA/repo for the Ubuntu official/Cairo-Dock/Debian repositories) 
* Working on the integration of Cairo-Dock into Ubuntu such as maintaining Cairo-Dock's Indicator applets, adding a Cairo-Dock session, etc.
* Patching other Free Software such as Nautilus <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nautilus/1:3.2.1-0ubuntu4.2|3.2.1-0ubuntu4.2]]</nowiki> (non-exhaustive list: <nowiki>[[http://ubuntu-dev.alioth.debian.org/cgi-bin/ubuntu-sponsorships.cgi?render=html&sponsor=&sponsor_search=name&sponsoree=Matthieu+Baerts+%28matttbe%29&sponsoree_search=name|here]]</nowiki>)
* Helping a friend (main LaTeXila's dev) by testing and maintaining its packages on Ubuntu (official and PPA - stable/unstable version - packages).

=== Areas of work ===
I'm a member of the Cairo-Dock team (mainly as a developer but also other things - website, translations, drivers, releaser because we're a very small team). I'm also cooperating with contributors of the cairo-dock-plug-ins-extras sub-project by merging branches and maintaining them.
You can see my work on LaunchPad: <nowiki>[[https://code.launchpad.net/cairo-dock]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[https://code.launchpad.net/~matttbe]]</nowiki>

=== Things I could do better ===
I'm still a student and I can improve my coding skill but about Ubuntu I think I can do more stuff and try to maintain more packages that I use.

About Cairo-Dock, the TODO list is big but it takes also a few time. Maybe the solution is to code faster :)

And also, I guess I have to improve my English writing skills :)

== Plans for the future ==
=== General ===
Having more responsibilities into the Cairo-Dock project and contributing to the Ubuntu project seem essential.
Regarding Cairo-Dock itself, I would like to continue into my role of core dev and improve the packaging for Debian (if it's possible ;) e.g.: <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cairo-dock-plugins/+bug/657564|bug #657564]]</nowiki>).
Regarding Ubuntu, joining teams such as the MOTU or firstly the ''universe-contributors'' one (I don't know if I have significant and sustained contributions) seems a nice challenge.

=== What I like least in Ubuntu ===
It's sometimes hard to find discussions about the purposes of some design changes in order to report the impacts (e.g.: <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/light-themes/+bug/968133|bug #968133]]</nowiki> which has still no official fixes and no answer from Light-Themes team).

==== General feedback ====
Matthieu has been taking good care of cairo-dock* and other packages and I never had to criticise anything of importance. It'd be good to have him upload these packages on his own.
==== Specific Experiences of working together ====
* https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cairo-dock/2.3.0~2-0ubuntu1
* https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/latexila/2.2.0-0ubuntu1

=== Didier Roche (didrocks) ===
==== General feedback ====
I sponsored quite a lot of cairo-dock* uploads for Matthieu, especially at the beginning of his maintainership journey. He has strong experience of ubuntu process and release schedule and has now high expertise on his cairo-dock packages and is strongly committed to them. I'm totally confident he would be able to maintain those himself without the need for a reviewer.

=== Andrew Starr-Bochicchio (andrewsomething) ===
==== General feedback ====
Matt has been a pleasure to work with, and I'm very glad to see that he's applying for PPU rights. I've sponsored uploads of all three of the requested packages for him in the past. I have confidence in his ability to continue maintaining these packages with out the need for sponsorship.

==== Areas of Improvement ====
I'd love to see Matt continue his work on other packages in the archive and become a full Ubuntu developer.

=== Sebastien Bacher ===
==== General feedback ====
I've done a few uploads of patches and updates for Matthieu and they were usually good to upload without changes. His work looks good enough for getting ppu rights.

Not sure, I didn't work enough with Matthieu to say
