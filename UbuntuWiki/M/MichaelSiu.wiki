=== About Me ===
I live in San Pedro Sula, Honduras my home country. I'm on my 1st year at <nowiki>[[http://www.unicah.edu/| UNICAH]]</nowiki> currently studying Computer Engineering.

==== Experience on Linux ====
I've had the opportunity to try many of the linux distros, and each of them has their own different taste. I dare to say that Ubuntu, in my opinion, is the best open source distribution from Linux not only because of it's comfortable interface, but because it provides an up to date, stable operating system for the average user, with a strong focus on usability and ease of installation.   

=== My Objectives on Ubuntu ===

One of my primary objectives on ubuntu is to learn as much as possible to operate the O.S at its maximum level, in order to be able to report bugs and better yet provide their solutions and fixes. That way contributing in the advance and development of more stable systems and also being able to help our friends and partners from all the ubuntu communities to solve any problems they encounter while learning such powerful system.  

== My Small Contribution on Ubuntu ==

=== Ubuntu Global Jam 2009 ===

I was invited to participate on the first <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HondurasTeam/Global_Jam|Ubuntu Global Jam]]</nowiki> in which I had the opportunity to interact with the colleagues of the Honduras Team, we had a very good time, this was the first step I took in getting involved and interested about helping the ubuntu community. We translated a guide/documentation that was about how to use, and the importance of using IRC. Since there are many people who enter the world of Ubuntu unaware of this tool, we also did some Launchpad translations, but we spent most of the time translating the Ubuntu Weekly Newsletter. (All the translations were done into Spanish)
 
  

=== My Expectations ===

I expect all the Ubuntu Communities specially the Honduras Team to continue being active (as it has been recently) due to the fact that in our country most of the people know very little about the Linux platforms. Thus we have a long journey in improving our knowledge on using this platform and not just to the average user but oriented on system development. Which I think it will surely displace the actual popular O.S. 

=== G-O-A-L-S ===

I think one of our primary goals as a community would be encouraging other people to explore the advantages of using Ubuntu. 

Try to be the most self-advocate as possible and share our knowledge with others.  

I think our work would be completed when we all migrate to Linux  {{http://www.sherv.net/cm/emo/laughing/smilie.gif}}
