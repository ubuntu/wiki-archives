== Introduction ==
The <nowiki>[[USTeams]]</nowiki> LoCo is pushing for official entries by 2008.  This is a fairly large task to meet for a team that is just starting out.  In order for us to apply for approval of our team, certain requirements must be meet.  This outline will serve as our roadmap for our team to follow in order to meet this goal.  It will contain the specific requirements needs as outlined here: <nowiki>[[LoCoGettingApproved]]</nowiki>  It will also list material, personnel and scheduling needed to fulfill this goal.

Of the incomplete items listed above, the most important items are the projects. The other items will take care of themselves as we progress toward preparing and presenting our application. For that reason, we should now concentrate on the projects: their scheduling, material, and personnel. At this point, I would like to remind everyone that even though some of these projects fall within already established teams, we will need to expand our help to these teams in order to provide a stable state-wide base, as well as to establish our team credibility.
