__TOC__

There is no point in having two different versions of Ubuntu in which the single difference is the installer available, instead should be a "regular" with both the graphical and text installer.

This would be a huge plus not because some people are forced to download the alternate version (when they already downloaded the desktop one) due to they cant boot into a graphical environment in the desktop version, but also that way the user gains freedom of choice (more installers available by default), and the same cd could be used in a bigger number of different machines.

I agree.
