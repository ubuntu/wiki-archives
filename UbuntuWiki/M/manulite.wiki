=== Summary ===

I am Manulite, a huge fan of Open Source with new-found passion for Ubuntu, both as an African philosophy, and as a linux distro. Ubuntu has given a lot of momentum towards the resolution of <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/bugs/1 | Bug #1 ]]</nowiki>, and since that is a good thing, here I am supporting it in any way I can!

I am a Senior Consultant with a very exciting local (Zimbabwean) outfit mainly focusing on IBM products and Enterprise Java Technologies. In my time with the team, I have deployed huge solutions on linux, locally and within Africa. I have also developed cross platform solutions all of which are also powered by linux.

* Member of the Zimbabwe Open Source Society
