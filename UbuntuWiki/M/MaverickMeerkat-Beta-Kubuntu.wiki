== Introduction ==

Kubuntu will release version 10.10, the Maverick Meerkat, in October 2010.
With this Beta pre-release, we are introducing some new and interesting things in preparation for the next official version of Kubuntu. Read below for some of the highlights.
For more information of what is planned and being worked on, please read the information available on
<nowiki>[[https://wiki.kubuntu.org/Kubuntu/Todo | this page]]</nowiki>.

'''NOTE:''' ''This is a beta (pre-) release. Pre-release versions of Maverick are '''__NOT__''' encouraged for anyone needing a stable system or for anyone who is not comfortable running into occasional, even frequent, breakage. Pre-release versions '''__ARE__''' recommended for Kubuntu developers and those who want to help in testing, reporting, and fixing bugs.' Please do not use this in a production environment with data  or workflows that you cannot do without.''

== Getting the Beta ==
Beta images can be downloaded from the following URL:
* http://releases.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/maverick/
It is always best to <nowiki>[[HowToMD5SUM|check your cd image]]</nowiki> before  you install!
The md5sums can be found <nowiki>[[http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/releases/maverick/beta/MD5SUMS|here]]</nowiki>.

'''Upgrades''' can be made from Kubuntu 10.04 LTS, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MaverickUpgrades/Kubuntu

== What's New In the Beta ==

=== Combined Desktop/Netbook ISO image ===
For 10.10 Beta, Kubuntu has merged the Desktop and Netbook images into one image featuring both the Plasma Desktop and Plasma Netbook workspaces. The appropriate workspace for your machine will be launched at login, you can also change the workspace in System Settings.

=== New default web browser - Rekonq ===

Rekonq is now the default web browser for Kubuntu.  It is built on both KDE Platform and Qt WebKit technologies and sports a modern, clean interface that maximizes space for web browsing and doesn't get in your way.  Both Konqueror and the Kubuntu Firefox Installer are still provided for users that prefer these options.

=== Global Menu by default for Plasma Netbook ===

Plasma Netbook now sports the <nowiki>[[http://agateau.wordpress.com/2010/05/10/getting-menus-out-of-application-windows/|Global Menu]]</nowiki> by default.  This innovation helps conserve vertical space on small netbook screens.  In combination with the Plasma Netbook panel no longer auto hiding by default this represents a significant improvement in Plasma Netbook usability from previous releases.

=== PulseAudio by default ===

Kubuntu now uses the PulseAudio sound server by default.  Building on the efforts of Ubuntu over the last several release cycles, this system is now used by Kubuntu to give users enhanced configurability, flexibility and ease of use.  System settings has been updated to enhance pulseaudio control integration.

=== BlueDevil ===

<nowiki>[[http://dantti.wordpress.com/2010/08/20/kpackagekit-new-userinterface/|KPackageKit updates]]</nowiki> bring a faster backend and an updated UI that provides a new Categories page, and new features such as a backup/restore tool for the list of installed packages.

=== Ubiquity Installer ===

Kubuntu's installer now has updated look and layout.

=== QApt-batch ===
<nowiki>[[http://jontheechidna.wordpress.com/2010/08/10/qapt-in-maverick/|Qapt-batch]]</nowiki> now replaces install-package as the update/batch-installer utility. QApt Batch features improved security features, improved robustness as well as PolicyKit support via QApt.

== Known Issues ==

The live CD "Guided" install option replaces the existing operating system installation in the selected partition (including destroying user data).  This is not obvious from the description.  See Bug (Bug:628864) for details.

The live CD autoresize installation option is not always available (see Bug (Bug:628897) for details).  To work around this issue, do any needed partition resizing before starting the live CD.  Partitions can be deleted and created using the manual partioning option if no data needs to be saved from them.

Due to Bug (Bug:608382), if you intend to burn an iso of the Beta to a usb device from a Kubuntu 10.04 LTS system, you will need to make sure you have ubuntu-updates ("Recommended Updates" in <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Kubuntu|KPackageKit's repository settings]]</nowiki>) enabled to install the bugfix release of usb-creator-kde.

== Feedback ==

We want to hear what you think about this Beta release of Kubuntu 10.10. We want to know if it Rocks, if it is just OK, or it is flat out wrong. No matter the feedback, as long as it is in line with the <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/community/conduct|Ubuntu Code of Conduct]]</nowiki> we would like to hear it.
