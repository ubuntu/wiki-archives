  a. We need to get verified to receive various perks from Canonical to operate better. So we need to fit together some key elements to make this a functional team.
  a. <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LoCoCouncil/TeamVerificationGuidelines]]</nowiki>
  a. Some ideas:
   i. Regional leaders?
   i. Regular IRL meetings?
   i. Weekly IRC meetings?
   i. Talks or Ubuntu seminars?
  a. Ways to spread Ubuntu to get more members here?
1. Wiki Page Updates (<nowiki>[[https://youtu.be/3WsIqPM8kPE?t=34m19s|34 minutes 19 seconds in the video]]</nowiki>)
  a. Estimated time: 5 minutes
  a. Agenda item owner: Simon Quigley

  a. Estimated time: 5 minutes
  a. Agenda item owner: Simon Quigley
  a. Should we have a website for our LoCo, or is the wiki page sufficient?

   i. IRC Client specific page
   i. Livestream page with embedded IRC client
   i. Positions(who does what and contact info)
1. Ubuntu Online Summit (<nowiki>[[https://youtu.be/3WsIqPM8kPE?t=1h7m42s|1 hour 7 minutes and 42 seconds in the video]]</nowiki>)

| nhaines
| I recommend redirecting the domain name to the main wiki page immediately.  And then that buys you time while you figure out what to do with the site.
| 01:37
|-
| nhaines
| It's better to get some kind of CMS in place to make it easier for contributors, as opposed to hand editing.  :)
| 01:37
|-
| adueppen
| I can go make a Github org for the LoCo right now
| 01:38
|-
| nhaines
| I definitely agree: figure out whether to use a website and then what audience it will serve.  Pick the tools afterward.

* To help document and to fill in people that couldn't make it, I set it up so the Hangout will be livestreamed on YouTube. This is also so that the people that are not participating, but are on IRC(or outside observers such as members of the LoCo council) can just watch. 5-10 minutes before the meeting starts, I will commence the livestream and I will paste the link in the IRC channel(#ubuntu-us-wi). So that means any joins, leaves, anything you say, will be put on the livestream for other people to watch. Please do NOT participate if you are UNDER 13 years of age, due to privacy laws in the United States. Legal consequences will be taken if this happens, not only for me(Simon Quigley), the publisher, but for you, the participant. If you just don't want your face shown/voice heard, then use the mute/turn webcam off button in Hangouts, and use IRC to communicate if you muted yourself. Obviously, make sure that your microphone doesn't sound awful if that is what you choose to use. The video and livestream are licensed under Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0). Any interpretations of this statement are controlled by the chair of the meeting. (all of this information is just a legal disclaimer, just in case)
