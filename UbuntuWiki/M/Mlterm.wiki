__TOC__

== MLterm ==
Mlterm is a multilingual terminal emulator on X11.

Web site: <nowiki>[[http://mlterm.sourceforge.net/]]</nowiki>

=== RTL support ===
Mlterm unlike many other terminal have support for variants of languages that including RTL languages (Arabic, Farsi, Urdu and Hebrew).

=== Why RTL support ===
* more terminal software are being translated and it needs RTL enabled terminal to be usable. (apt-get apt-* and zenity etc..)
* basic commands cd, ls, pwd while dealing with files in RTL language
* reading and editing RTL text (cat, less, nano and vim etc..)

=== Fonts and anti-aliasing ===
using fixed width font with anti-aliasing can give the terminal a very good appearance. you can chose the font and other sittings by the GUI. to open the GUI settings window just hold Ctrl and press the right mouse button.

=== Embedding ===
Mlterm unlike vte doesn't support embedding. so it can't be used inside Synaptic for example.
see,<nowiki>[[http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_name=20100404.171742.74728127.arakiken%40users.sf.net| Developer comment]]</nowiki>

=== Installing Mlterm by default with RTL languages ===
installing mlterm by default for the RTL languages will fix the issue of RTL text appearing in the wrong direction (ex, abc, cba). that will make apt-get messages and ls, cat output unreadable and the same for every program in terminal.

==== Vte not going to be fixed ====
It have been stated that vte developer wont fix the problem in vte because it needs to rewrite vte. no patch will do it. bicon which is another workaround is no longer maintained.

=== Discussion ===
==== Including mlterm when a user chose to install RTL language support ====
what are the requirement to have this done? I've sent a message to Ubunt-desktop mail-list but no respond. I'll try contacting Ubuntu-devs and some other related mail-list maybe. could any one help on this please? -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:damascene]]</nowiki> I've opened the new main bug as I've been told it would be better in #ubuntu-devel -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:damascene]]</nowiki>
I hope some one other add testing cases for Urdu ,Persian and Chinese -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:damascene]]</nowiki>
