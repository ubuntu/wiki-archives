 0. ''Security:''
** <nowiki>[[http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=aoetools|CVE entries]]</nowiki>: no entries (also checked for more generic aoe).
** <nowiki>[[http://secunia.com/search/?search=aoetools|Secunia history]]</nowiki>: no entries (same as above)
** Any binaries running as root or suid/sgid ?  Any daemons ?

    Yes. Copyright size is bigger than the entire code put together.
 0. ''Quality assurance:''
** In what situations does the package not work out of the box without configuration ?<<BR>>
    The init script to automount aoe devices require some configuration to make sure AOE traffic is not sent to all or the wrong interface (NOTE: AOE IS NOT TCP/IP BASED).
