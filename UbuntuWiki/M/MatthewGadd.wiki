=== Intro ===

After using Ubuntu for a few years, I decided to start contributing.
So far I've tried a bit of bug management, and a bit of translation (into English or UK English as launchpad refers to it).
I have had some previous coding experience (mainly in C#) and I have tried python, perl, java and vala as well as VBasic (back on windows) but none of them enough to actually fix any bugs yet. I'm planning to learn python a bit more so that I can debug some simpler python programs.
