__TOC__

=== This is a ManXample entry for the "nmap" command. ===

This is the area to propose additional strings, comments, tips, work-flows, examples, and reference for commands and daemons.  ManXamples will be added to the bottom of the official manpage entries the following standard format, so people can always find them and the listings are uniform.  Please look at the commands listed before adding more, so work is not duplicated.  If needed, simply add a function to an existing command if it adds significant value without complicating the spirit of the original example.

1)  To quickly search your entire network for IPv4 addresses, use the following command:
    '''sudo nmap -sP 10.0.0.0-255'''
