== Reviewers ==
MartinPitt: This package has a horrible security history, full of sloppy PHP code. Upstream does not backport fixes for older releases, so we will have a hard time with supporting this application for 5 years, as planned for Breezy+1. No approval from my side. moin seems to be much saner, so please reconsider.
