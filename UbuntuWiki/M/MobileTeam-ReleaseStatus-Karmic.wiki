=== Roadmap ===

See <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MobileTeam/Roadmap|MobileTeam/Roadmap]]</nowiki> for our meta-page describing planned work.  We also have a <nowiki>[[http://piware.de/workitems/mobile/karmic/report.html|burndown chart with specs' status for karmic specs of the mobile team]]</nowiki>.

=== Milestoned bugs ===
==== open bugs ====

* <nowiki>[[Bug:455173|#455173: mutter crashed with SIGSEGV in meta_compositor_sync_stack()]]</nowiki> Apparently mutter 2.28.0 is too new and destabilize things; bfiller and paulliu are extensively testing a package downgrade of mutter and will upload to the ~moblin/moblin PPA unless it shows regressions
* <nowiki>[[Bug:456412|#456412: title of saved web favorite contains unescaped characters]]</nowiki> should be on the DX team's plate; can be deferred to SRU if too intrusive to fix in 9.10
* <nowiki>[[Bug:459022|#459022: kernel -z0 meta packages should be dropped]]</nowiki> Should be on the kernel team's plate

==== interesting SRU targets ====

* <nowiki>[[Bug:431963|#431963: SATA port issues on Babbage]]</nowiki> we got hardware for proper testing and upstream proposed some changes which made the kernel unbootable
* <nowiki>[[Bug:447886|#447886: On startup Gnome Keyring asks for password in the background]]</nowiki> this should be on the DX team's plate; fix is likely too intrusive for release
* <nowiki>[[Bug:451553|#451553: Lots of errors during install on dove]]</nowiki> Doesn't prevent installation albeit it makes it really slow; no fix in sight so more of a post-release fix
* <nowiki>[[Bug:453682|#453682: late resume failure on dove]]</nowiki> Breaks suspend/resume a bit (system is almost unusable afterwards); no fix in sight so more of a post-release fix

==== fixed bugs ====

* <nowiki>[[Bug:431206|#431206: partman-uboot for manual partitioning on Dove]]</nowiki> that's in, we should continue testing though
* <nowiki>[[Bug:438680|#438680: imx51: please quieten down bootmessages]]</nowiki> Not a bit deal, just nice to have; mostly solved by kernel changes
* <nowiki>[[Bug:435046|#435046: Ethernet port on the dove sometimes changes MAC addresses]]</nowiki> Not sure whether this is limited to Uboot running from NAND or not, ethernet address is computed at boot time and we likely want to document this in the installation guide (setting ethaddr in uboot env is enough)
* <nowiki>[[Bug:435151|#435151: don't hardcode mem= on dove cmdline]]</nowiki> Just need dropping of mem= from flash-kernel and debian-cd + some testing

* general armel stuff
** rebuilds have been pushed
* armel+mx51: ok
** Babbage 2.0 is in a bad shape for both Jamie and I, but my hardware is very unstable; could either be hardware breakage and/or kernel/bootloader regressions
   :-/

** Installation is very slow
** Need to cleanup installation instructions
* Ubuntu Moblin Remix: ok
** Would like to fix Mutter bug
