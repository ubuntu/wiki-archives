=== About Myself ===

Hello, this is Alex "MistaED" Fuller.

=== Interests in Ubuntu ===

First I must say that this is a great distro! The community is the best I have seen! I'd like to contribute in future, possibly in the art department like icons or in other unforseen areas (possibly 3D-related things with the desktop with new technologies like Xgl/Aiglx). I do my part by trying to convert every man and his dog to ubuntu, so far it hasn't been extremely successful for everyone but some have been converted!

=== This wiki needs to be longer! ===

Yes, yes it does.
