=== Summary ===

The menu system has been completely reviewed for Dapper. This spec talks about general policy that has been followed and specific actions that are going to be taken to match the policy.

=== Rationale ===

==== General Policy ====

The following general policy guidelines are followed in each decision
* If an item is primarily launched by a specific MIME type and works with one file at a time, it can be hidden
* The separation between Applications > System Tools and the System menu must be removed. This will be achieved by removing the items in Applications > System Tools
** With above, items that are mostly system administration tasks and/or use gksudo should be moved to System > Administration
** Items which affect only the current user are to be moved to System > Preferences
** Anything else that is not going to be hidden/removed is moved to Applications > Accessories
* Tools which are likely to simply confuse users are to be hidden or removed
* Tools which have their functionality replaced with another simpler tool are being hidden or removed
* There should be a single point to access each function of the system

=== Implementation ===

=== Specific Menu Item Actions ===

* Each of the following items has been reviewed and a decision has been made on it. Any item not listed will be kept.

==== Purging "System Tools" ====

* Applications Menu Editor [Done, "alacarte" use the Accessories category]

* XSane Image scanning program [Done]
  - Scanners now accessible via GIMP, so hide.

==== "Internet" and "Office" ====

* GNOME BitTorrent [Done]
  - hide, as it is best accessed by launching a file
* "Internet" > "Evolution Mail" vs. "Office" > "Evolution"

==== Other tasks ====

* Generate list of applications that install a menu item in Applications > System Tools
* Make certain hiding application on menu does not hide it on Open With... [Done]
* Develop way to right-click on menu item and select "Hide"

===== Coordination with Gnome =====

* Pass ideas and rationale to upstream
* Encourage upstream to do the following integration work:
** "About Me" + "Users & Groups" + "Sessions"
** "Font" + "Theme"
** "Keyboard" + "Keyboard Shortcuts"

=== Outstanding issues ===

We should probably coordinate with upstream (Gnome) during their 2.14 cycle.

=== Reviewers Comments ===

MarkShuttleworth: very nicely written up. Clean and crisp. Very clear what the plan is. Thank you! Please let's get this in asap so we can deal with feedback.
