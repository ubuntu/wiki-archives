=== Answers to All Your Questions ===

'''I don't know anyone there. Is that OK?'''

 This is the first MassachusettsTeam meeting ''ever'' (not really, we had a meeting a few weeks back 31st March at a pizza place). Nobody knows anyone so it will be equally awkward, I mean fun, for everyone. Better come this time though because next time we're all going to be best friends.

'''But I'm not 21 yet or can't drink for some othe reason. Why should I go to brewing company?'''

 Even though it has "Brewing" in the name, CBC is restaraunt with great food. You should be fine.

'''How do I get there?'''

 <nowiki>[[http://www.cambrew.com/directions.html|Follow the directions]]</nowiki> to ''One Kendall Square, Cambridge, MA.'' The nearest T stop is the ''Kendal Square'' stop on the Red Line. 

'''What if I get lost on the way?'''

 You can call BenjaminMakoHill. His phone number is 206-409-7191.

'''I don't run Ubuntu yet. Should I come?'''

 Sure. Bring a laptop. You can try not get beer spilled on it and we can try to set you up with FeistyFawn.

'''I still have friends who don't use Ubuntu. Can they come?'''

 Sure. Tell them to bring their laptop. See above.
