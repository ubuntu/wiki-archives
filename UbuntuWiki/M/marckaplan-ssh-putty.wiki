See the windows section for further information about PuTTY.

<nowiki>[[http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/|PuTTY]]</nowiki> is a free SSH client for Windows, which you can download from <nowiki>[[http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html|here]]</nowiki>.

To log in to your computer, type your computer's name or IP address into the "Host Name (or IP address)" box, click on the "SSH" radio button, then click "Open".  You will be asked for your username and password, then you'll get a command-line on your Linux computer.

===== Tip: Keep alive =====

Your PuTTY (ssh) session will automatically log out if it is idle. To keep the connection active (alive), '''before you make the connection''', select "Connection" on the left of the PuTTY Configuration window, and type 120 in the "Seconds between keepalives (0 to turn off)" box.

===== Tip: Importing your openssh keys =====

For security reasons, you should normally create a new SSH private key for every computer you use.  However, if you have no choice but to reuse a private key, PuTTY can import an Ubuntu private key with <nowiki>[[http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html|puttygen.exe]]</nowiki>, as <nowiki>[[http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/0.60/htmldoc/Chapter8.html#puttygen-load|described]]</nowiki> in the PuTTY manual.

===== Tip: Generating Public Keys =====

The <nowiki>[[http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/0.60/htmldoc/|PuTTY manual]]</nowiki> has a <nowiki>[[http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/0.60/htmldoc/Chapter8.html|section on public key authentication]]</nowiki>.

== SCP and SFTP ==

PuTTY has command-line SCP and SFTP utilities for Windows that act much like the command-line scp and sftp utilities for Unix-like systems.  Alternatively, <nowiki>[[http://winscp.net|WinSCP]]</nowiki> is a graphical utility to transfer files.
