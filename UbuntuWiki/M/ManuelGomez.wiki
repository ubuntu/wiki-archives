I am a 18 year old Computer Engineering student from Medellin, Colombia. I am pretty active in the spanish community of Ubuntu. Most of the time you can find me in the #ubuntu-es channel where I am an op. I am also the biggest contributor to <nowiki>[[http://www.guia-ubuntu.org/|Guia Ubuntu]]</nowiki> (the spanish version of the <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntuguide.org/|Ubuntu Guide]]</nowiki>. I am also collaborating in the UbuntuInLibraries Project, this project strives to get Ubuntu in as many libraries as possible.
