==== Ubuntu ====

'''Community Status:''' Ubuntero

I attempt to provide technical support to Ubuntu users, especially those of the PowerPC persuasion.  I am active on a number of IRC support channels, and I periodically browse the community forum in search of problems to solve.

'''Specifics:''' I dedicate as much of my time as possible to help oversee the success of this project.  I have, thus far, provided countless hours of technical support as well as some (minimal) financial and material support to the project.  I believe the Fluxbuntu project will help the Ubuntu community by spreading the range of hardware supported by Ubuntu and helping Ubuntu get into the embeded market.  On top of that, I see the project providing upstream patches and bug-fixes to the Fluxbuntu-specific Ubuntu packages while simultaneously benefiting the Fluxbox project by possibly adding new features and spreading the user base of the Window Manager.
