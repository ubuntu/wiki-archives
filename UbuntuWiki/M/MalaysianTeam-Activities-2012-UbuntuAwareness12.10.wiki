Ubuntu 11.10 Awareness Campaign is a project by Yuzery Yusoff for Ubuntu Malaysia LoCo Team. The idea behind this project is to increase public awareness about Ubuntu brand and to let them have question in mind about 'What is Ubuntu?'. Therefore, before October 2012, Yuzery Yusoff have designed Ubuntu Quantal Quetzal t-shirt to be spread across the country and to be wear on 18th Oct 2012. The reason to wear this t-shirt is to make it seen by people and let them ask question about ubuntu, getting information about where and how to get ubuntu.
