'''Total Attending: 12 (1 maybe)'''

Note: An 'Ubuntu User' is a category for anyone that wishes to add their number to those attending but would rather not disclose their name on the Wiki.

Brian's grill notes: My grill is a LP grill, about 4'x3'x1.5' or so. The left third is vegetable-only and I have separate tools; the meat-portions do not discriminate against sources of meat. I still, as far as I know, need transportation for the grill. I probably will be ordering pizza as well, which can be ordered on demand.
