=== About ===
MoreUbuntu is an open source project to provide multiseat Ubuntu powered by Linux-VServer to provide real isolated full-feature X11-Desktop based on Ubuntu.

First announcement and public show were made at LinuxTag2006. Thanks go to '''derjohn''' (http://linux-vserver.org/LinuxTag2006).

=== Background ===
==== Multiseat ? ====
Dated back to 11-April-2002 (known as backstreet-ruby), which can be found at Aivils' site http://www.ltn.lv/~aivils/index.php. Many people worked on multiseat as listed on the "Links" site: http://www.ltn.lv/~aivils/index.php?proj_id=multiseat&menu_id=4.

==== Linux-VServer ? ====
Linux-VServer Project's WIKI: http://linux-vserver.org/Linux-VServer
 "Linux-VServer provides virtualization for GNU/Linux systems. This is accomplished by kernel level isolation. It allows to run multiple virtual units at once. Those units are sufficiently isolated to guarantee the required security, but utilize available resources efficiently, as they run on the same kernel."
Thanks go to '''Herbert Pötzl''' and all '''#vserver team'''.

And thanks go to '''GeraldHochegger''' for providing VServer for Ubuntu.
