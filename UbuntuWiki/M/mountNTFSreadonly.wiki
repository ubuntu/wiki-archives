To back up files or to get read only access to a NTFS drive you need to do it manually since Ubuntu can not auto mount it.

Ensure that the hard drive you wish to access is set to slave if you wish to back up the contents from another computer, if the hard drive is installed and a boot manager working and in effect ignore this.

Boot up. The computer should boot as it did previously.

Open Terminal Applications > Accessories > Terminal

<code>df</code>

Look for the hard drive that is around the size of the one you wish to make readable.

If you do not see a drive listed that matches the size of the one you wish to mount

<code>sudo fdisk -l</code>

Make a directory to mount to.

<code>sudo mkdir /media/NTFS</code>

Ensure you have permissions to this directory

<code>sudo chmod 777 /media/NTFS</code>

Mount the drive

<code>sudo mount (location of hard disk you wish to mount) /media/NTFS</code>

This should give you read access to a NTFS drive.
