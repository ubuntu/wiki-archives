== Main Inclusion Report for devicekit-disks ==

=== Requirements ===

# ''Availability:'' <nowiki>[[http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/d/devicekit-disks]]</nowiki>; available for all supported architectures
# ''Rationale:''
** GNOME 2.27 (and the Linux world in general) will move from the huge and hard to maintain hal to several smaller and more agile components: DeviceKit as a small basic D-Bus interface to udev, and DK-{disks,power,*} as particular services.
** Build/binary dependency of gnome-disk-utility and gvfs
 0. ''Security:''
** <nowiki>[[http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=devicekit|CVE entries]]</nowiki>: None
** <nowiki>[[http://secunia.com/search/?search=devicekit|Secunia history]]</nowiki>: None
** D-Bus activated service running as root, similar to hal.
** No network activity.
** Shallow source code review performed: no manual memory allocation, no sprintf or other insecure constructs, properly uses DeviceKit, d-bus, and PolicyKit higher level APIs
 0. ''Quality assurance:''
** Background daemon, not user visible. Works out of the box.
** No debconf.
** Not in Debian yet.
** <nowiki>[[http://hal.freedesktop.org/docs/DeviceKit-disks|upstream]]</nowiki> is vigorous (Richard Hughes)
** <nowiki>[[https://bugs.freedesktop.org/buglist.cgi?product=DeviceKit&component=DeviceKit-disks&keywords=&bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED|Upstream bug tracker]]</nowiki>: No bugs yet (but certainly to come, but Richard is responsive)
** Deals with fixed and removable IDE/SCSI/USB disks; all of those are widely available for testing.
** No test suite.
# ''UI standards:'' N/A, no UI, just D-Bus interface
# ''Standards compliance:'' 
** <nowiki>[[http://www.pathname.com/fhs/|FHS]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[http://www.de.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/|Debian Policy]]</nowiki> compliant
** Simple standard cdbs/debhelper packaging, no patches
 0. ''Dependencies:''
** libatasmart (MIR to be filed)
 0. ''Maintenance:''
** How much maintenance is this package likely to need? Moderate; it has a central role in handling removable media. This maintenance effort will merely move from hal towards DK-disks instead of being added to our stack.
** Canonical desktop team will look after the package in Ubuntu, maintenance will be shared with Debian's pkg-utopia team; hopefully the foundations team can contribute as well (Scott?)
 0. ''Background information:''
** The general purpose and context of the package is be clear from the package's debian/control file.
** What do upstream call this software? DeviceKit-disks
