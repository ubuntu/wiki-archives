   04:11 Gloubiboulga ok, xubuntu meeting is supposed to have begun, but Jani and Daniele are not there :/
   === Whatsisname [n=whatsisn@rrcs-67-52-37-209.west.biz.rr.com] has joined #ubuntu-meeting
   04:11 Gloubiboulga I've sent them a mail, I hope they'll come...
   04:11 luzi         jani said that he'll be late
   04:11 Gloubiboulga luzi, ok thanks :)
   04:13 Gloubiboulga there are only 2 items which need to be discussed: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/XubuntuMeetingAgenda-2006-04-05
   === sivang checks the agenda
   === sivang wonders if installing xubuntu-desktop will clash with ubuntu-desktop
   04:15 Gloubiboulga sivang, I don't think so
   04:16 Gloubiboulga but there's a problem with kubuntu-desktop
   04:16 luzi         Gloubiboulga, what do you think about the logo?
   04:17 Gloubiboulga luzi, as I write on the ML, I'm not sure that the mouse in the logo is really the best idea
   04:17 Gloubiboulga *wrote
   04:17 sivang       Gloubiboulga: where can the logo be seen ?
   04:17 sivang       (I don't have xubuntu installed)
   04:18 Gloubiboulga sivang, http://www.dsslive.org/xubuntu/tmp/artworks/html/logos.html
   04:18 Gloubiboulga the column on the right are some proposed logos
   04:18 luzi         and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/XubuntuArtwork
   04:18 sivang       why the mouse?
   04:18 olive        why not ? :)
   === sivang feels this like denotes weakness
   === anstei [n=anstei@84-73-60-31.dclient.hispeed.ch] has joined #ubuntu-meeting
   04:19 Kinnison     sivang: The xfce logo is a mouse iirc
   04:19 Gloubiboulga the mouse is the Xfce logo
   04:19 Riddell      Gloubiboulga: what's the problem with kubuntu-desktop?
   04:19 anstei       hi everyone, sorry i'm a bit late
   04:20 ogra         Riddell, it installs KDE ?
   04:20 Gloubiboulga Riddell, let me find the message in the xubuntu ml
   04:20 thomerz      hmm i like the logo with the mouse :)
   04:20 sivang       Kinnison: you also interested in Xubuntu ? :)
   04:20 Gloubiboulga Riddell, https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/xubuntu-devel/2006-April/000888.html
   04:20 Kinnison     sivang: I used to comaintain the xfce packages in debian
   === Riddell politely ignores ogra
   04:20 ogra         :)
   === sivang apologizes fo rthe ignorance about the mouse
   04:21 Gloubiboulga so, about the mouse, I think that Xubuntu is not Ubuntu with Xfce
   04:21 Riddell      Gloubiboulga: ok, I'll give that some testing soon
   04:21 luzi         maybe it's a bit more than ubuntu and xfce, but these two are the 'main components'
   04:21 Gloubiboulga xubuntu's aim is to be light, that's why xfce has been choosen
   04:22 Gloubiboulga Riddell, thanks :)
   04:22 Gloubiboulga luzi, that's true
   04:24 Gloubiboulga anyone else has a point of vue on this logo question ?
   04:24 Gloubiboulga we should vote for this :)
   04:25 luzi         i agree with some people on the ML: the logo with the mouse is good, the colors are too KDEish
   04:26 luzi         i like these colors: http://www.doink.ch/xubuntu-logo/
   04:26 Gloubiboulga so what about a grey logo (with or without the mouese)?
   04:26 luzi         grey would be good, too
   04:26 Gloubiboulga luzi, I like the second one
   04:27 luzi         it's more or less the colors from the Xfce.org webpage ...
   04:27 jurjenst     luzi: I too like some more blue in it... only grey is too flat
   04:28 jurjenst     the top logo in the luzi page would be my pick
   04:28 jurjenst     perhaps with the bigger greyed mouse of the other logo page
   04:30 jurjenst     the triangle logo would be too way off from the xfce logo to be understood
   === ..[topic/#ubuntu-meeting:Ubugtu] : Current meeting: Xubuntu | Calendar: http://fridge.ubuntu.com/event | Logs: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MeetingLogs/ | 06 Apr 08:00 UTC: Dapper Development Status | 11 Apr 20:00 UTC: Technical Board | 12 Apr 12:00 UTC: Edubuntu | 12 Apr 14:00 UTC: Xubuntu | 13 Apr 14:00 UTC: Dapper Development Status
   04:30 Gloubiboulga ok, so I guess that (almost) every one agree with the mouse in the logo
   04:30 Gloubiboulga and colours could be grey/blue
   04:31 luzi         yep, i  think you're right
   04:31 Gloubiboulga lets wait the big boss and we'll define the one we pick then, ok?
   04:32 luzi         alright
   04:32 Gloubiboulga 2. goodies meta package :)
   04:33 Gloubiboulga this package can't be installed for the moment, but could be fixed
   04:33 Gloubiboulga I think that it should be installable, now that isos are available
   04:34 Gloubiboulga for now the policy was to wait after the non-yet-ported plugins to be ported
   === ddonky [n=don@66-190-240-198.dhcp.klmt.or.charter.com] has joined #ubuntu-meeting
   04:35 Gloubiboulga it's a more technical question.. any thoughs?
   04:36 Gloubiboulga ok... :)
   04:39 jurjenst     You mean a package that installs the most common xfce packages even if you already have the normal ubuntu desktop installed?
   04:40 jurjenst     or an add-on on the xubuntu release CD?
   04:40 Gloubiboulga jurjenst, not really, it's a package that installs all the panel applets
   04:40 Gloubiboulga it can't be on the CD because thoses applets are in universe
   04:41 jurjenst     ah... and xubuntu should be as lean as possible?
   04:41 Gloubiboulga but it'd make things easier to install several tools in one shot
   === G0SUB [n=ghoseb@ubuntu/member/g0sub] has joined #ubuntu-meeting
   04:43 Gloubiboulga jurjenst, it's a good way to discover Xfce possibilities for new users imo
   04:43 sivang       omg, this is amazing
   04:44 jurjenst     when it's in universe... I don't know if it is worth the effort...
   04:44 sivang       looks like a better GNOME
   04:44 jurjenst     just get the most common tools in main would be better
   04:44 Gloubiboulga jurjenst, yes I agree
   === luzi_ [n=luzi@dhcp-203-14-vpn.unizh.ch] has joined #ubuntu-meeting
   04:44 jurjenst     when it is very usefull get it on the CD by default
   04:45 Gloubiboulga I don't think that it's *very* usefull, even if i'd like to see the panel plugins on the CD
   04:45 jurjenst     perhaps a specific version of add/remove programs would be nice with losts of goodies
   04:46 Gloubiboulga jurjenst, good idea :)
   04:46 jurjenst     it is possible to create seperate data files for add/remove applications for xfce?
   === _mvo_ [n=egon@p54A658CA.dip.t-dialin.net] has joined #ubuntu-meeting
   04:47 Gloubiboulga I don't know
   04:48 jurjenst     it is far more work than a small dep application but it would be much better for people to browse without getting everything installed directly
   04:48 Gloubiboulga indeed
   04:49 luzi_        jurjenst, which add/remove app are you talking about?
   === pips1 [n=philipp@hsz-hgkz.isz.ch] has left #ubuntu-meeting ["Leaving"]
   04:50 Gloubiboulga the one which comes with ubuntu I think
   04:51 jurjenst     is xfce4-appfinder something like the ubuntu add/remove applications (the one in the start menu?)
   04:52 luzi_        i don't think the gnome add/remove app is planned for xubuntu
   04:52 Gloubiboulga jurjenst, no, it lists installed applications
   === luzi_ is now known as luzi
   04:53 jurjenst     it looked like it... :(
   04:54 Gloubiboulga jurjenst, just to make things clear: your idea is to install plugins in the default install and set up a add/remove dialog box, right?
   04:54 Gloubiboulga or the add/remove would install the package too?
   04:57 jurjenst     I tink it is best to port the gnome-app-install package to xfce (it is written in python) or is the GTK+ library already in your distro...
   04:57 jurjenst     and then create xml files for the goodies
   04:57 Gloubiboulga ok
   04:57 jurjenst     is GTK already on the iso?
   04:58 Gloubiboulga yes, Xfce uses GTK
   === slomo [n=slomo@ubuntu/member/slomo] has joined #ubuntu-meeting
   04:59 jurjenst     so it's possible to just write xml files for all your favourite apps and package a xfce-app-finder... it will take some days work but it would be nice ;)
   05:00 Gloubiboulga jurjenst, would you be interested/could you work on this?
   05:00 Gloubiboulga we'll have to discuss this with Jani first, but if he's ok...
   05:02 jurjenst     it even looks like a single file:  /usr/share/gnome-app-install/featured.txt with all the packages...
   05:03 luzi         Gloubiboulga, do you think jani is still coming? i've got to leave soon...
   05:03 jurjenst     so I you give me a list of your fav files it should be a breeze to package... just some polish love
   05:03 Gloubiboulga luzi, I don't think so :(
   05:04 jurjenst     Gloubiboulga: can you create a file with one package name for earch line and put it online somewhere?
   05:04 Gloubiboulga jurjenst, yep I think so :)
   05:04 jurjenst     the rest of the info seams to be pulled out of dpkg
   05:04 Gloubiboulga jurjenst, could you join #xubuntu ?
   05:04 jurjenst     ok
   05:04 Gloubiboulga I think we can end the meeting here
   05:04 luzi         ok
   === jurjenst [n=jurjen@levelscity.demon.nl] has left #ubuntu-meeting []
   05:05 Gloubiboulga I'll send a mail on the list about what we've discussed (which is not much)
   05:05 luzi         yeah, do that
   === lbm [n=lbm@x1-6-00-13-10-7a-d1-e4.k233.webspeed.dk] has joined #ubuntu-meeting
   05:06 Gloubiboulga thanks every one
