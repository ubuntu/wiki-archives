Release parties cover the major and sub revisions of the official Ubuntu distribution.  Releases such as Dapper Drake, Edgy Eft, Feisty Fawn, and Gutsy Gibbon.  Key elements of these release parties will be held online but local regions of Missouri are welcome to hold their own release parties and join in the fun.
