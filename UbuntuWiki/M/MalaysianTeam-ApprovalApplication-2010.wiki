Embracing the humanity theme of Ubuntu, we welcome all who are interested in Ubuntu, GNU/Linux and Open Source Software in general to join us making Malaysia great for Ubuntu, GNU/Linux and Open Source.<<BR>><<BR>>Started in July 2005, the Malaysian Team has already grown to over 200 members and has been approved as official LoCo team since 2009.
