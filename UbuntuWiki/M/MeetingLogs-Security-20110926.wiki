=== Agenda ===
* Announcements
** Ubuntu 11.10 is scheduled to release in a few weeks. If you are interested, it would be great if people helped make sure that the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/ubuntu-cve-tracker|Ubuntu CVE Tracker]]</nowiki> is up to date for the devel release (particularly for universe/multiverse packages).
* Review of any previous action items
** jdstrand to update highlighted packages to also mention UCT in general: this was completed, but not in <nowiki>[[SecurityTeam-HighlightedPackages|HighlightedPackages]]</nowiki>, because it is included in <nowiki>[[SecurityTeam-GettingInvolved|GettingInvolved]]</nowiki> and that didn't make sense.
