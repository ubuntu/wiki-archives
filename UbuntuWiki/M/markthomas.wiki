==== TESTIMONIALS: ====

I met Mark Thomas when I joined AZLOCO back in March 2014.  One is easily impressed by his knowledge of all things associated with Ubuntu and servers and his willingness to provide assistance both at Team installfests and on our IRC channel.  He rightly deserves the privilege of Ubuntu membership for his continuing and untiring actions on behalf of the entire Ubuntu community in general and of course our LoCo Team in particular.

I'm working with Mark Thomas for about 2 years and a half now, my day to day interactions with Mark have demonstrated his desire to do things right and make Ubuntu better. I think Mark would make a great Ubuntu member.
