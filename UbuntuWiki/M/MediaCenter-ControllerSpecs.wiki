=== Summary ===

=== Rationale ===

Please see UbuntuMediaCenter to get informations about the infrastructure of Ubuntu Media Center (Kernel + modules). The definition of this spec is mandatory to have an easy controller module development for UMC.

=== Use Cases ===

* Paul has discovered an open source voice recognition software and he is thinking of controlling his Media Center using it. He comes check this page to see how he could make a controller out of that new software . He does a mapping and, there goes the new controller.
* Ubuntu Media center UI developers don't have to worry about the controller anymore. They use the specs here to develop the UI behaviors.

=== Scope ===

==== Summary ====

Let's use existing controllers to define our controller interface. If you want to request a non written fonction to be add, just add it in the discussion section. 

'''Notes''' : Controller modules won't have to implement this interface, they'll trigger it. The one implementing it will be the <nowiki>[[Media_Center_kernel]]</nowiki>.

==== Discussion ====

* OuattaraAziz : How to manage a playlist with that controller ? maybe using the navigation panel '''OK''' button. This will add the selected item to the playlist. By if it's the '''play''' button which is pressed, the playlist is cleared and the selected item is added and played .
