== Main Inclusion Report for `logcheck` ==

This tool is well known to be installed on servers. It's directly security related.

# ''Availability:'' Available in universe, Arch: all.
# ''Rationale:'' If Ubuntu really wants to get on servers we should have this. Maybe a default install for those?
# ''Security:'' CAN-2004-0404, two scripts in /usr/sbin.
# ''Quality assurance:''
** Works reasonably well out of the box.
** Seems to be no grave bugs upstream (debian).
# ''Standards compliance:'' Looks clean.
# ''Dependencies:'' All build-deps are in main.
