Hi, my name is Mike Bronner. I have been using Linux off and on for about 5 or 6 years now. I started my first few years working my way up through various Suse versions, and eventually dropped Linux for a while, because I didn't have the time I needed to learn all the details and master command-line Linux.
However, with the advent of Linspire 4.x and eventually 5.0 I was able to start using Linux as a non-specialist. Finally there were GUIs and windows that I could use. I know, I know... you're probably wondering why I don't stick with Windows in the first place.
Well, truth be told I (like so many others in the Linux community) are sick of being pushed around by Microsoft's Licensing charades. I was delighted to find a most helpful and giving community that would enable others to achieve things in Linux for little or no costs to individuals.

(Back to the original story:) Well, then I got my hands on a copy (download) of Ubuntu, and I was sold. Linspire was based on KDE, and I prefer the Gnome interface (just a personal preference). So I installed Ubuntu and I was hooked. Very simple, minimalistic install, only what I needed (well, a few extras, but not like Linspire)! I loved it. And I haven't turned back since. Since Ubuntu 6.10 I have used it as my sole Desktop OS at home (work mandates Windows, so no luck there). [The only reason for me to boot up in Windows every so often is to play that one game that won't run in Wine or Cedega.]

During this time I have also become an active member in the Wine community and maintain numerous applications in Wine AppDB, where I help with testing, providing feedback, and reporting bugs.

==== Goals for 2007 ====
<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/UbuntuGrey.png]]</nowiki> Become an official Ubuntu Member.<<BR>>
<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/UbuntuGrey.png]]</nowiki> Achieve 500 posts in the Ubuntu Forums.^1^<<BR>>
<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/UbuntuGrey.png]]</nowiki> Write 12 How-To Articles on Ubuntu.<<BR>>
<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/UbuntuGrey.png]]</nowiki> Write at least 60 blog entries regarding technologies involved with or related to Ubuntu.<<BR>>
<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/UbuntuGrey.png]]</nowiki> Develop at least 1 Linux application or tool.

^1^ This will help me to both get more involved in the community, as well as keep me up-to-date on Ubuntu going-ons.
