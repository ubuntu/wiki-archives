== What is REVU-Tools ==

REVU-Tools is a set of scripts which can be used to automate the reviewing process.

For a guide to reviewing Debian packages, you can refer to <nowiki>[[MOTU-Packages-Reviewing]]</nowiki>.

UPDATE: THIS IS NOT USED BY REVU ANYMORE, BUT CAN STILL BE INSTALLED FOR PERSONAL USE.

== How to use it ==

On <nowiki>[[REVU]]</nowiki>, only REVU admins can run these tools. If you are not a REVU admin, ask one to run it on the package you want to review.

If you are a review admin, wanting to review a $package updated on $date, and $url is the url of the $upstream tarball, run 

<pre>
cd /var/revu/revu1-incoming/$package-$date
wget $url
revu-report
</pre>

This will generate report files in the current directory, that will appear on the REVU interface.

<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/IconNote.png]]</nowiki> revu-report detects the dsc, the orig and the upstream tarball automagically. If there are several dsc files in the directory and/or several files that could be upstream tarballs, you'll have to run:

<pre>
cd /var/revu/revu1-incoming/$package-$date
wget $url
revu-report $tarball $dscfile
</pre>

<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/IconHint2.png]]</nowiki>  Since version 0.3, revu-orig uses uscan to take advantage of debian/watch files in the package and get the upstream tarball automagically. Therefore, it is not necessary to download the upstream tarball anymore in many cases, just run :

<pre>
cd /var/revu/revu1-incoming/$package-$date
revu-report
</pre>

If files are missing to generate the report and there is no debian/watch, then it will be said so in the report, and you can get the upstream tarball manually and run the command again.

The main file to look at is REVU_report, that gathers most of the useful informations gotten from the scripts :
* Whether there is a usable debian/watch file in the package ;
* Whether the is a new upstream tarball available ;
* Whether the package is a Debian-native (no orig.tar.gz + diff.gz) ;
* Whether the package FTBFS ;
* Whether the upstream tarball has been changed or repacked ;
* Whether `debuild && debuild -S -sa` generates files in diff.gz outside of debian/ ;
* Whether lintian and linda are happy about the package.

<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/IconHint2.png]]</nowiki>  Since version 0.3.1, REVU-tools have been made into a REVU-independant deb package, available in Dapper (universe) . This package is made to work on any system, but might require to adjust some settings in the scripts.
In particular, you might want to change PBUILDERNAME in /etc/revu-tools.conf (most users want "sudo pbuilder", on REVU it's "pbuilder-dapper") to have it fit with your settings.
You'll obviously need a working pbuilder to use REVU-Tools on your machine.
