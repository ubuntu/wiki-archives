=== Introduction ===
Ubuntu Mars was created specifically for the purpose of welcoming the first inhabitants on Mars to the Ubuntu Community.  Our goal is to reach into the depths of our known world and include as many as possible to embrace the true Spirit of Ubuntu.  We will be teaming up with <nowiki>[[http://www.google.com/virgle/|Project Virgle]]</nowiki> to make this possible.  Our planned location is approximately around the <nowiki>[[http://themis.asu.edu/zoom-20040713a|Windstreaks in Daedalia]]</nowiki> at <nowiki>[[http://www.google.com/mars/#lat=-11.781325&lon=-137.790527&zoom=6|this location]]</nowiki>
