=== The Report ===

==== General ====
* UDS was a great success. Many tracks and lots of interest meant for an interesting week.
* UNR has been handed off to the Desktop team leaving the mobile team very much focused on ARM work.
* There is a distinct lack of hardware in the team, QA and IS, hopefully we will see more soon.

==== Blueprint Work ====
* Lots of work on fleshing out the blueprints and specifications for the upcoming Lucid cycle. The roadmap information can be found at <nowiki>[[MobileTeam-Roadmap|Mobile Team Lucid roadmap]]</nowiki>

==== ARM ====
* ARM image builds are currently blocked due to a combination of hardware failures (buildd's get out of sync) and package problems. Fixes are being worked on.
