=== Introduction ===
Welcome to the Missouri Team home page! We are committed to increasing awareness of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) in general, and Ubuntu in particular, across the Show-Me State. If you are an Ubuntero who lives in Missouri or in a multi-state metropolis such as Saint Louis or Kansas City, you are welcome to check us out and get involved today!

We have an open enrollment for our team. Follow the link to our <nowiki>[[http://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-missouri|Launchpad.net]]</nowiki> group to sign up. If you need further assistance, follow the guide on <nowiki>[[MissouriTeam/HowToJoin|HowToJoin]]</nowiki>.

=== Mission ===
The mission of the Ubuntu Missouri Local Community Team is to encourage the adoption of the Ubuntu family of products as the platform of choice for home, business, government, and education throughout the Show-Me State. We will use our resources to advocate, educate, and support current and future users of Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Edubuntu, Xubuntu, and other Free and Open Source Software products.

=== Become an Active Member ===
Contributing to the Missouri Team is easy. Get as involved as you want! Some possible ways:
* Do you have a local Linux User Group (LUG) in your area? Let us know and we will list it here. Get involved with your LUG -- it is a great way to meet fellow Linux users. While you're there, let them know about Missouri Team!
* Organize an installfest in your home town. Invite fellow Missouri Team members -- LUGers love nothing better than a ROAD TRIP!
* Let us know about IT conferences and shows in your area and help us get a group together to man it!

=== Projects ===
We have several start up projects defined to help move the LoCo towards becoming an official group.  Feel free to review our <nowiki>[[MissouriTeam/Projects|Current Projects]]</nowiki> and take part by contacting the project organizer.

=== Meetings ===
We have IRC meetings every Sunday at 7 PM. Archives are created during each meeting and can be found on our <nowiki>[[MissouriTeam/Meetings|Meetings]]</nowiki> page.
