__TOC__

This is the page where I keep ideas/features that I'd like to be present in the Kubuntu 7.04 release, currently referred to as "Edgy+1". I'd be more than happy if anyone decided to implement them!

==== The List ====

* Grub configuration tool in systemsettings (I intend to take part in developing it) 
* Better tools for Kubuntu Testers (taking part as well) 
* Stable and functional support for libjingle in Kopete (possibly taking part as well)
* A tool that can check whether Grub will support splash (so I can integrate it in 1.)
* Painless upgrade between any release (especially Dapper -> Edgy+1 - one click, few minutes and it's done)
* Network monitoring systray icons (think <nowiki>[[http://www.kde-apps.org/content/show.php?content=12956|knemo]]</nowiki>) - configurable in systemsettings

More to come real soon!
