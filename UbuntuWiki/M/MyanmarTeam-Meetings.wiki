== Ubuntu-MM Meetings ==

=== Date, Time, Place ===
Myanmar Team meetings are held on the second Tuesday of every month, 6pm AEST in #ubuntu-mm on freenode.  Please add agenda items below

=== Adding Items to Agenda ===
You are welcome to add any items that you feel should be discussed to the agenda for the next meeting. In the interests of keeping everything neat please use the following format: first, a half line subject, followed by a short description as a sub-point of the subject, and signing it with your wikiname or IRC nick after that. For example:

* Half line subject
** Short description - Your_wiki_name (yourIRCnick)

Note: Please also e-mail your topic to the list so that all members (even those who can't make meetings) are aware and can contribute to the topic. This will aid in keeping meetings short and discussion open.
