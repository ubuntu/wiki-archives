Hello!

I'd like to re-apply for the Ubuntu Membership Board.

I believe in properly recognizing active contributors, as well as enabling/unblocking them to improve their contributions.

I've been a long-time contributor within Ubuntu, for more than a decade, as well as a current member of the Ubuntu Membership Board.<<BR>>
In my time during the board, I greatly enjoyed getting to know more contributors, especially people who are active in areas of the community that I previously didn't even have knowledge of their existence.

The membership process had little changes during my time, but some of those that I contributed to (like a clarified <nowiki>[[Membership-Rejoining|re-application format]]</nowiki>) have been appreciated by some.
