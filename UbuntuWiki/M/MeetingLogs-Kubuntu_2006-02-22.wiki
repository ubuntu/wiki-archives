09:02 jpatrick     damn timezones
09:03 Pygi         ah well :P
09:03 [Nirvana]    jpatrick: there was that link on the meeting page though... still... I had to
                   rush home from school (it's starts at 3 EST)
09:04 apachelogger very quite for a meeting?!
09:04 Nirvana      we're not all here
09:04 jpatrick     where's raphink ?
09:04 Riddell      20:01 < Riddell> all iteams on agenda are from Hobbsee, but she's not here
09:04 Riddell      so if anyone has any other business, go ahead
09:04 raphink      oh thanks for poking me jpatrick
09:04 raphink      :)
09:05 jpatrick     you said you wanted to talk before FF
09:05 raphink      jpatrick: yeah, but I think it was mostly about allee's and Tonio's stuff
09:05 raphink      it seems tonio is not here tonight though
09:05 raphink      I'll try to call him
09:05 Riddell      we have moodin and keep in, I'll be reviewing Tonio's
                   kubuntu-default-settings tomorrow and uploading
09:06 jpatrick     probably got cut off again
09:06 jpatrick     what about knemo?
=== ArmeBosse [i=Arme-X@dra38-2-82-233-106-22.fbx.proxad.net] has joined #ubuntu-meeting
09:06 Riddell      I'll look at that tomorrow along with kubuntu-default-settings
09:06 Riddell      i.e. does it work out of the box
09:06 apachelogger jpatrick: you think his isp tries to stop kubuntu's progress?
09:07 Lure         what about font DPI and reduced font sizes?
09:07 allee        kubuntu-default-settings miss a entry so one gets not prompted to create an
                   index (does not work due to htdig missing)
09:07 Riddell      Lure: I'll be reducing the font sizes along with  kubuntu-default-settings
                   tomorrow :)
09:07 Riddell      allee: interesting point
09:08 Lure         Riddell: just KDE defaults or also individual apps (Konsole,
                   Konversation...)?
=== [Nirvana] [n=marco@CPE0080c8292db5-CM000f9f5158ce.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com] has joined
09:08 Riddell      Lure: kde font sizes affect all apps
=== Hirion [n=hirion@draugr.de] has left #ubuntu-meeting []
09:08 Lure         most, not all - quite some apps have own font setting
09:09 Lure         for example, Konversation is at 11pt
09:09 jpatrick     in the chat window?
09:10 Riddell      Lure: 11 is the current default (in kdeglobals)
09:10 allee        Lure: konversation adapts to kde defaults
09:10 Lure         OK, then fine - I know when I wanted to reduce defaults, I had to change
                   quite some manually
09:11 allee        Btw. is the tabs at top of konversation and konsole set in stone?  Did anyone
                   from usability comment on pro/con of it
09:11 [Nirvana]    I know I proposed this last meeting, but is it still all right to debate the
                   regeneration of K menu on KDE upgrade issue?
09:12 [Nirvana]    * I was at a school meeting if anyone was wondering *
09:12 Riddell      allee: it's not set in stone, but I think anyone can argue either way and be
                   quite valid, it's mostly personal preference
                   Big plus of down is that 'interesteing things in konsole, konversation is
09:12 allee        happening at the buttom.  So having tabs there reduces need to move
                   mouse/eyes
09:12 Riddell      [Nirvana] : what's the issue
09:12 [Nirvana]    can I C/P it from what I wrote?
09:12 Lure         I would agreed with allee - similar for Kopete (as it will be tabbed by
                   default now)
09:12 Riddell      [Nirvana] : sure
09:13 [Nirvana]    it's the third bullet on this page (under Agenda):
                   https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kubuntu/Meetings/16-02-06
                   This is different form e.g. konqueror where there is not prefered location in
09:13 allee        a web page/ file listing.  So better keep tabs at top, next to the other
                   action ake toolbars and menus
09:13 Riddell      allee: exacely, and the argument the other way is consistency with konqueror
09:14 allee        allee: I argue that those are two different kinds of apps that deserve a
                   different layout
09:14 [Nirvana]    also, what was the posistion on the klickibunti idea?
09:14 Riddell      [Nirvana] : you'll have to tell us what the "cool Settings feature under
                   Actions" is
09:14 allee        Riddell: I agree consistency is very important, but work flow  and the way
                   you use apps is it too
09:15 Riddell      [Nirvana] : ask amu about klickibunti, I think he just needs someone to code
                   it (put a web wrapper on his scripts) and test it
09:15 [Nirvana]    Riddell: One sec, will post screenie
09:16 [Nirvana]    I only have what it looks like now... not a before/after screenie btw :(
09:17 [Nirvana]    OK, screenie: http://img211.imageshack.us/my.php?image=kmenu9nw.png
09:18 [Nirvana]    Settings, and System Menu are NOT there when you upgrade from 3.4 to 3.5(.1)
09:19 [Nirvana]    what I did was delete all kde settings and re-install kubuntu-desktop (with
                   3.5.1)
09:19 Riddell      [Nirvana] : those were deliberately removed to avoid duplication
09:20 Riddell      I can't remember how they were removed, might have been a patch to kicker,
                   else a settings in kubuntu-default-settings
09:20 Riddell      but Settings is already in System Settings or KControl and System Menu is on
                   kicker by default
09:21 [Nirvana]    ahh, I just thought it was easier to use this way, in my opinion
09:22 Riddell      might be the Extensions= option in
                   /usr/share/kubuntu-default-settings/kde-profile/default/share/config/kickerrc
09:22 Riddell      yes, it is
09:22 Riddell      any other business?
09:23 Riddell      groovy, I'll go and do the dishes then
09:23 [Nirvana]    hehe
=== [Nirvana] has no idea what's going on ^^
=== jeang [n=jeang@dsl-145-6-68.telkomadsl.co.za] has left #ubuntu-meeting []
09:26 raphink      sorry I was on the phone with tonio
09:27 raphink      he can't make it this time either but has two things to say
09:27 jpatrick     Riddell's gone....
09:27 jpatrick     but fire away!
09:27 raphink      jpatrick: so where are we now? or is the meeting over already?
09:28 jpatrick     well, he went to do the dishes
09:28 raphink      hmm ok
09:28 raphink      is there actually a meeting? Like is there someone taking notes to make a
                   report and so on?
=== poningru [n=poningru@n128-227-87-85.xlate.ufl.edu] has joined #ubuntu-meeting
09:29 raphink      hmmpf doesn't seem so
09:29 jpatrick     what did he have to say?
09:29 raphink      ok well two things
09:29 [Nirvana]    spit it out raphink!!! lol :P
09:29 raphink      the first one is about the default graphic program in KDE
09:29 raphink      right now we have krita as default
09:30 jpatrick     oh goodie
09:30 raphink      krita is very complex, although complete too
09:30 raphink      most people don't want to use krita for basic stuff
09:30 [Nirvana]    krita is hard to use
09:30 raphink      koloupaint is much more simple
09:30 raphink      easier to use
09:30 raphink      kolourpaint sorry
09:30 raphink      and kolourpaint is already in main
09:30 raphink      so it might be a good idea to have it as default instead of krita
09:30 jpatrick     but Krita's like Photoshop
09:31 raphink      so most users don't have to figure out about layers and so on
09:31 raphink      when they only want to draw a square or a circle
09:31 raphink      graphic designers can install krita, but most users don't want it
=== Riddell back
09:31 allee        raphink: when/where is krita (as default) called automaticly?
09:31 raphink      allee: ?
=== Pygi [n=mario@83-131-251-197.adsl.net.t-com.hr] has left #ubuntu-meeting ["Leaving"]
09:32 raphink      allee: I'm not talking for myself, but reporting for Tonio since he couldn't
                   make it, so I'm not prepared to questions ;)
09:32 allee        raphink: other way round.  What do you mean with default
09:32 Riddell      krita is there to match gimp in ubuntu
09:32 raphink      allee: krita is installed in the default profile it seems
                   true, there was another one, on DSLinux... like xpaint or something, he gave
09:32 [Nirvana]    it good praises (and he doesn't even know that his computer is running linux,
                   I told him it was Win95, because it is an intell 166)
09:32 Riddell      krita in SVN is looking really nice in terms of usability improvements
09:32 raphink      Riddell: yes, and we believe this is not what it should be, unless our users
                   are graphic designers
09:33 raphink      Riddell: the point is that most basic users want to draw circles and squares
09:33 raphink      not having to deal with layers, filters, etc.
09:33 Riddell      then use openoffice
09:33 allee        ahh, kolourpaint is not in kubuntu-desktop.
09:34 raphink      open-office is too heavy for simple stuff
09:34 raphink      allee: yes that's it
09:34 allee        yes, rest of the familie used kolourpaint
09:34 Lure         raphink: so suggestion is to replace krita or to add kolourpaint?
09:34 raphink      so that's Tonio's proposal to have kolourpaint installed by default
09:34 allee        so depending on target audience  kolourpaint is too less, or krita too much
09:35 raphink      Lure: yes, either
09:35 Lure         I think Krita should be installed by default as it is great app
09:35 Lure         but dummy paint is also fine with me ;-)
09:35 raphink      some might complain about redondance
09:36 raphink      but I don't think krita and kolourpaint are redundant
09:36 raphink      they don't really do the same thing
09:36 allee        if krita or kolourpoint depends on audience. the are not the same
09:36 raphink      yes
09:36 raphink      so what are opinions ?
09:36 raphink      1) keep it with krita only
09:36 raphink      2) replace krita with kolourpaint
09:37 raphink      or
09:37 raphink      3) get both
09:37 raphink      what do you think?
09:37 Riddell      1
                   Maybe they can both be packaged. Kolourpaint can be dubbed "basic image
09:37 [Nirvana]    manipulation program" or "basic image editor" so users will know the
                   difference.
09:37 jpatrick     1++
09:37 raphink      3
09:37 Lure         1 (personally), but also fine with 3
09:37 [Nirvana]    3
09:37 allee        3) -- because we should serve both  newbies and experts
09:38 Riddell      3 is not an option, that's against the whole single CD idea
09:38 raphink      Riddell: ok
09:38 raphink      then I'm for 2
09:38 raphink      if 3 is no option
09:38 allee        Riddell: then whom do we want to serve first?  newbies or exports?
09:38 [Nirvana]    2 for me too, though 3 would be a blessing
09:39 allee        experts know now to install stuff,  newbies don't
09:39 Riddell      as I say krita is improving well in terms of usability (although that won't
                   be in dapper)
09:39 raphink      allee: with the single CD, I want to serve newbies for sure
09:39 allee        so then my vote would be 2) only add kolourpaint
09:39 raphink      Riddell: a program that has layers, filters and such is not suitable for any
                   newbie imo, however easy to use it claims to be
09:39 allee        s/add/deliver Kolourpoint/
09:40 raphink      I don't want my mom, sister of girlfriend to both about technical design
                   stuff
09:40 raphink      s/both/bother/
09:40 allee        + kids
09:40 raphink      allee: hehe yes
09:41 raphink      so ok let's remove 3) since ti's not an option
09:41 raphink      so
09:41 raphink      1) keep only krita
09:41 toma_        does ubuntu ship gimp by default?
09:41 raphink      2) get only kolourpaint
09:41 raphink      I vote 2
09:41 Riddell      toma_: yes (although it's the first thing to remove on space constraints)
09:42 raphink      toma_: I'm nto sure actually
09:42 raphink      I remember having to install gimp
09:42 allee        2 me too
09:42 [Nirvana]    I vote 2
09:42 raphink      I installed ubuntu not long ago on a few machines and I remember gimp was not
                   installed
09:42 toma_        then i would vote 1. you dont have to use layers
=== [Nirvana] has to go out, it's been a great meeting :D
09:42 raphink      bye [Nirvana]
09:43 raphink      jpatrick: ?
09:43 allee        toma_: but they clutter interface.  krita is not useable by 'familie' or
                   grandma Muriel ;)
09:43 jpatrick     2++
09:44 raphink      allee: oh you've got a grandma Muriel?
09:44 toma_        allee: then krita has changed a lot, i admit im not up-to-date.
09:44 raphink      krita is aimed to replace photoshop
09:44 raphink      or gimp
09:45 toma_        allee: but i hate really limited apps, last time i saw kolourpaint i was less
                   then impressed. I could not do the simple things as i wanted
09:45 jpatrick     If we have KOffice in Dapper+1, then we'll have Krita then
09:45 raphink      toma_: most people on windows pirate photoshop and use paint
09:46 Lure         jpatrick: that is potentially good point
09:46 allee        It's it somehow possible to add a 'Krita (install)' menu ?  (ditto for
                   koffice)
09:46 toma_        allee: isnt edubuntu for your kids?
09:46 raphink      toma_: no it's for schools
09:46 jpatrick     toma_: something I was going say
09:46 raphink      toma_: edubuntu is not aimed at children
09:46 allee        edubuntu does much more
09:47 raphink      not directly at least
09:47 toma_        ok
09:47 raphink      imo
09:47 raphink      anyway, there's no rush on this, but Tonio wanted to point this out
09:48 Lure         should we replace krita with kcolourpaint+digikam ;-)
09:48 Lure         I am sure everybody has digital photos these days...
09:48 raphink      digikam has nothing to do with it
09:48 allee        Again: would it be an option to somehow make it 'trival' to install apps that
                   should be there but didn't fit on CD?
09:48 allee        candidates: krita, koffice, ..???
09:48 raphink      allee: mornfall is working on this
09:49 allee        raphink: great!
09:49 raphink      allee: making a new adept stuff that will do as the simple installer for
                   ubuntu
09:49 jpatrick     allee: koffice will get openoffice out
09:49 raphink      there has been snapshots last week I think
09:49 raphink      jpatrick: not so far ;)
09:50 raphink      ok anyway
09:50 raphink      that's about it
09:50 raphink      ;)
09:50 allee        jpatrick: _when_ we move to koffice.  It should be very easy to add
                   openoffice, even for newbies
09:51 raphink      jpatrick, Riddell : Tonio also said he needs MOTUs to review
                   netswitch/knetswitch (so either of you+me or something like this)
09:51 toma_        isn't koffice comparable with kolourpaint as krita is with openoffice?
09:51 jpatrick     yeah, I could
09:52 raphink      toma_: ??
09:52 Riddell      raphink: I've revu'ed it, go ahead
09:52 raphink      toma_: you mean if koffice is to ooo what kolourpaint is to krita?
09:53 raphink      Riddell: well that's it
=== jpatrick does netswitch
09:53 allee        lets postpone the koffice debat to dapper +1
09:53 raphink      I think Tonio would like knetswitch to be in Kubuntu by default ideally
09:53 raphink      but I doubt this is possible right now
09:53 toma_        it seems inconsitent to me to choose for kolourpaint+openoffice, i would
                   expect kolourpaint+koffice and krita+openofffice for users who want more
09:53 Riddell      raphink: I don't think it's ready
09:53 raphink      yes
09:54 Riddell      raphink: there's user inteface issues, but also I've had it freeze on me
09:54 raphink      but there's nothing else that is
09:54 raphink      and the fact is that many people use wifi
09:54 raphink      and there's no kde tool for it that is good enough
09:54 Riddell      until knetworkmanager
09:55 raphink      which is not to happen for now
09:55 raphink      I mean we haven't seen it so far
09:55 allee        yeah, network management is bit of a mess.
09:55 Riddell      no, it needs a CVS network-manager
                   Riddell: will it be possible to backport knetworkmanager to dapper?  If yes,
09:56 allee        it may not make sense to invest energy in new tools for dapper that are
                   better replace by something else
09:57 allee        (the 'else' is knetworkmanager)
=== ubuntugeek [n=ubuntuge@64.141.138.3] has joined #ubuntu-meeting
09:57 jpatrick     raphink: are you uploading?
09:57 raphink      uploading what jpatrick ?
09:57 Riddell      allee: no, it can't be backported
09:58 jpatrick     netswitch/knetswitch
09:58 allee        argl :(
09:58 allee        So
09:58 allee        a) keep the status as in breezy
09:58 raphink      jpatrick: no
09:58 raphink      jpatrick: not yet
09:58 allee        b) try to add *netswitch working before release
09:58 raphink      jpatrick: but I can do it
09:58 allee        more?
09:58 jpatrick     raphink: I'm doing netswitch
09:59 raphink      the fact is that the netswitch developers have basically redone the whole
                   program in a week for us
09:59 raphink      as Tonio asked them to modify some stuff
09:59 raphink      they've been improving and programming it again for Dapper
10:00 raphink      so we kind of owe them a good place for their work ;)
10:00 raphink      they even developed knetswitch so it could be included in Kubuntu before FF
=== allee nods
10:01 allee        I assume we can request addition to main later (when we know it's ready for
                   default use)
10:01 allee        +?
10:01 raphink      sure
10:02 raphink      I'm sure after the work they've done for us they're ready to make it better
10:02 raphink      fix bugs and so on
10:02 raphink      :)
10:02 raphink      ok well no reaction
10:02 raphink      anyway, the idea is to get it in universe for now
10:03 raphink      and we'll see how it goes
10:03 raphink      any other point to be talked about?
10:03 allee        raphink: sounds good.  I can offer some time in this field.  But if upstream
                   is actively involved there maybe no need
10:04 jpatrick     netswitch uploaded
10:04 raphink      yes
10:04 raphink      tonio knows about this
10:04 raphink      ok :)
10:04 raphink      good :)
10:05 allee        end?
10:05 raphink      I guess
10:05 raphink      who is leading the meeting?
10:05 jpatrick     you
10:05 raphink      hahaha
10:05 raphink      no, I came late, can't be ;)
10:06 raphink      ok well if no one has anything to say, then the meeting is over
10:06 raphink      :)
10:06 raphink      hmm
10:06 jpatrick     unless Hobbsee pops out right now
10:06 raphink      we just have to plan next one
10:06 raphink      I guess in two or three weeks
10:07 jpatrick     same time
10:07 Riddell      I'm busy in two weeks
10:07 raphink      sure
10:07 raphink      ok
10:07 raphink      three weeks?
10:07 raphink      the 15th of march
10:07 raphink      is that fine?
10:08 jpatrick     yep
10:08 raphink      allee, Riddell ?
10:08 allee        isn't this too late?
10:08 allee        I mean ..
10:08 raphink      not for me at least
10:08 jpatrick     please note that the Kubuntu devs are evening people
10:09 allee        shouldn't hte next meetng be some kind of status and todo before release.  to
                   assign open points
10:09 Riddell      fine for me
10:09 allee        jpatrick: late in sense far away
10:09 allee        so 3 weeks are too far away
10:10 raphink      hmm
10:10 raphink      well riddell is busy in 2 weeks
10:10 raphink      and 1 week is too early
10:10 raphink      since our main goal in the near future will be to fix bugs
10:10 raphink      so there won't be much to talk about in a week I think
10:10 jpatrick     write docs
10:11 allee        well, let Riddell fix the date.  I assume only him knows the big picture and
                   where more work & coordination is needed
10:11 raphink      yes, too
10:11 toma_        a bit ot, but i've a bit time left, if you need some simple hack or app for
                   kubuntu, let me know.
10:11 raphink      sure
10:11 raphink      toma_: bugfixing?
10:11 allee        toma_: -d switch for media2path please
=== allee hides
