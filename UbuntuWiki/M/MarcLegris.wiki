Do take a minute to peruse Marc's Launchpad page and have a look at the large number of bugs he has worked on, either by reporting issues with the systems he certifies, by providing further information on existing reports, and working with enablement engineers to follow up on, and solve, compatibility issues with systems undergoing enablement and certification. His work has resulted in Ubuntu being available preinstalled in, and compatible with, more and more systems every day. If you bought an Ubuntu-certified computer this year, chances are the certification was done by Marc. He has also contibuted to improving the test suite, infrastructure and procedures for the certification team. Through his direct and indirect work, Marc has helped put Ubuntu in the hands of many new users. I can only see Marc's contributions to Ubuntu expanding from what he has done as part of the Hardware Certification team, and I think he'd make a valuable addition to the Ubuntu community as an official Member. -- DanielManrique

Marc's work helps put Ubuntu in the hands of more and more people each day - laptop after laptop, desktops, and release after release.  His contributions are priceless and each bug he reports helps bring Ubuntu to the masses.  He's an easy add to the Ubuntu community. - mahmoh
