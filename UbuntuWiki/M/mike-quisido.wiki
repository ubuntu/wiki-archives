=== About Me ===

The world of computing is my oyster, a constant source of excitement and new discoveries. Particularly, the open-source platform holds a special place in my heart. For me, it's more than just code; it's a vibrant community where human ingenuity sparks groundbreaking ideas and tangible solutions. It's this collaborative spirit that drives me to explore and contribute.

On a personal note, I'm Michael Mendoza Quisido III, a Web Developer proficient in both front-end and back-end development. Python3 with Flask, PHP, and various CMS platforms are my primary tools. Building themes for PHP CMS's from scratch is a particular passion, as is managing web hosting using Linux-based control panels. My experience extends to forum platforms like phpBB and vBulletin (the same technology behind Ubuntu forums), and I'm always eager to dive into new challenges as long as they involve PHP.

Beyond technical skills, what truly defines me is my dedication to continuous learning and collaboration. I believe that working together within the open-source community allows us to achieve incredible things, pushing the boundaries of what's possible and making a positive impact on the world.

I'm thrilled to be here and connect with other passionate individuals. Let's explore the endless possibilities of the open-source world together!
