=== Notes and Results ===
* 6 members were present
* We will have our own IRC channel in #ubuntu-us-ma on irc.freenode.net (NOTE: the actual channel is now #ubuntu-massachusetts)
* At least for now, we won't have our own forum
* In-person meeting planned for 3/31
* We will focus on getting (Ed)ubuntu into schools. MichaelSelva and mgomeztccs work at schools and are working on getting edubuntu labs set up.  GoatTuber is also working on setting up an edubuntu lab at a Boston school.  MichaelSelva offered that we visit his school and see the setup.  We will try to help them out and then use their work as an example.
* In addition to the technical part of setting up and maintaining edubuntu, schools need a curriculum to work with the computers.
* We should get in touch with the Boston/MIT LUG
* We can help out with install-fests, or set up our own
* Set up a network for donating old PC's.  According to Spitty, MIT already does something like this.
