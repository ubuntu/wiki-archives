Ubuntu user since 2008

Used version 7.10 for a week, then upgraded to 8.04 Hardy Heron

== Working Hardware: ==

* MicrosoftWirelessLaserMouse6000 - everything but tilt scrolling
* Dell A920 Printer - scanner is not tested yet (probably doesn't work)
* Nvidia GeForce 5200 - one of the worst video card models on the face of the planet.
  Restricted drivers work pretty well.
