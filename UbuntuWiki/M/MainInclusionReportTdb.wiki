__TOC__

== Main inclusion report for tdb ==

=== Requirements ===

1. ''Availability:'' `http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/t/tdb`, compiled on all arches.

2. ''Rationale:'' build dependency of `debtags`

3. ''Security:''
* No CANs.
* No Secunia record.
* `libtdb1`, `tdb-dev`: no executables.
* `tdb-tools`: No executables which run with elevated privileges.

4. ''QA:''
* Installation: 
** `libtdb1`, `tdb-dev`: only a library, no end user tool.
** `tdb-tools`: command line tools, but no manpages, no documentation.
* Bugs: no showstopper Debian bugs.
* No special hardware interaction.

5. ''Standards compliance:''
* Standard `debhelper` packaging.
* FHS met.
* Does not meet library policy: wrong package name `tdb-dev`, should be `libtdb-dev`.
* Does not meet Debian Policy: no manpages.
* Source package is a mess, lots of undocumented patches in the diff.gz.

=== Reviewers ===

MartinPitt: Okay security-wise, but maintaining this package will not be enjoyable. I don't like to see `tdb-tools` in main. `libtdb1` and `tdb-dev` in main is fine for me.
