__TOC__

My name is "Murali Krishna Marimekala", in short "Murali", a Senior Software Engineer (SSE) working in an Indian based Software Company which provides services related to Multimedia Solutions and DSP. From past 4 years I have been working in Embedded Linux domain projects. Though I have enough experience to handle Linux Projects, I feel I still need to improve my technical skills to deserve "A Linux Geek" title. 

Now I am Ubuntero and would like to join you with hands to Promote and develop Ubuntu.

Apart from office time, I listen lots of music (melodies,rap,pop,rock etc )and watch movies, play cricket with friends in weekend, swimming became my hobby and I like to spend exploring world more through net :).

Hope, I will get a great opportunity to take knowledge and share my knowledge.
