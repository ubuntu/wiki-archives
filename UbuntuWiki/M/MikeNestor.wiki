=== About Me ===
I've been using Linux for years and have those "fond" memories of installing Slackware from floppy disk. I've mainly been a web developer but have always stuck my nose into various projects to fix bugs or add little features as needed at various jobs. I've finally gotten around to using Launchpad since I've been an Ubuntu user for the last few years and intend to start submitting any patches/features I think others would find useful. I just hope they're worthy!
