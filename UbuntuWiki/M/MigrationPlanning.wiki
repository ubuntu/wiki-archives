__TOC__

There is an old adage that says '''If you don't have a plan, then you plan to fail'''

Right or wrong, here are some items you need to consider
before migrating to Ubuntu.
* Backup your Windows data. Making a Backup of your Windows data cannot be '''stressed''' enough. The best method is to make several CD/DVD/Thumb Drive copies of your pictures, documents, etc.
* Backup your operating system using recovery tools. Have your recovery CD or DVD handy - Most systems which are delivered with Windows already installed also come with some sort of recovery or re-installation disk. If you don't have a recovery disk try to obtain one.
* Learn how to check the integrity of any downloaded Ubuntu ISO image using the 'md5sum' command.
* Run the Ubuntu Live CD for a two weeks before starting the migration. You can actually make some changes to the Live CD and save them to a thumb drive for use across Live CD sessions.
* Learn about and understand Hard Drive partitioning.
* Read up on using Internet Relay Chat (IRC).
* Get on IRC #ubuntu channel and observe what problems folks are having
* See if you have any of those problems on your Live CD session. Some things you won't be able to check out on the Live CD session, but those you can, do so.
* Don't expect everything to work the first day.
* Expect to have problems getting some hardware to work. Look upon problems as opportunities to learn something new. Don't look upon problems as show stoppers. In actuality does it really matter if your Ubuntu sound doesn't work the first day or even in the first week. Remember, you can always boot into your Windows OS.
* High end Video and Sound Systems appear to be the areas where many problems occur. These areas also generate many of  the questions asked on the IRC channel(s). Nvidia has both free and restricted drivers available.
* Google your question before asking for help on an IRC channel.
* Don't get frustrated, be patient when asking questions on IRC channels. Not everyone on the ubuntu channels is anxious to help you solve your problem.
* Learn how to use Ubuntu pastebin to post large amounts of text when asking for help on the #ubuntu channel
* On the #ubuntu channel, don't ask if you can '''ask a question''',  just ask the question. Don't ask your question over and over that will get you no answers.

* And last but not least '''Consider the Ubuntu installation a Success''' if you can get your hardware to boot Ubuntu and provide you with a login screen, Then, you can move forward with fixing any problems you may encounter.
