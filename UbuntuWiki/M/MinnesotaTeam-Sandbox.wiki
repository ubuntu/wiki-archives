Welcome to the Minnesota Team Sandbox. Pages under development can be created as http://wiki.ubuntu.com/MinnesotaTeam/Sandbox/<your page>. In order to keep track of Sandbox pages, please put a link to your page here. Once completed to your satisfaction, you can move it to its proper place and remove the link.

In my opinion, the layout used on FloridaTeam, MassachusettsTeam, CaliforniaTeam, and MichiganTeam is nice, and we should consider copying it.  Feel free to start doing so by making a template based of those here and copying in the information from our existing pages.
