=== About Me ===

My name is Michael Tel. My first contact with Ubuntu was at a store in my home town. I was curious and installed Ubuntu 11.04 as a dual boot next to Windows XP. Due to a virus on the XP partition I started using Ubuntu more and more. Since the release of 12.04 I've installed this version instead of 11.04 and Windows XP.
On my laptop I installed Xubuntu.
