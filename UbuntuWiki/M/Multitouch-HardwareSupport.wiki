==== Synaptics Touchpads ====
Older models do not have any multitouch support. Some newer models have semi-multitouch capability and provide the number of touches up to 3. Some newer models have full multitouch capability for up to two touches, and provide the number of touches up to 4.

=== Other Devices With Known Drivers ===

<nowiki>[[http://lii-enac.fr|ENAC]]</nowiki> has developed a generic HID driver that works with many Windows 7 compatible touch devices.
* <nowiki>[[http://lii-enac.fr/en/projects/shareit/multitouch-devices.html|ENAC's general list of Linux multitouch devices]]</nowiki>
All of the ENAC supported devices should work in Ubuntu. Note that support is contingent upon the version of the Linux kernel in any particular Ubuntu version.

<nowiki>[[http://nextwindow.com|Nextwindow]]</nowiki> is a touch device company. While no open source drivers exist for their products, they do support Ubuntu through their <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/nwfermi|Nextwindow Fermi Driver]]</nowiki> project.

=== News ===
Occasionally we will hear of new devices and drivers with upcoming or unknown support.
