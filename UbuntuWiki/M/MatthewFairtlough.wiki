Email: 
I have just stepped back into the Linux world after taking a 3 year break.  I'm using only laptops at the moment and this is a challenge especially with my ancient but still powerful ThinkPad.  At the moment I'm running Feisty on a Fujitsu Lifebook S7020D and things are going pretty well.

See <nowiki>[[http://www.fairflow.org]]</nowiki> for more about me (though the website is still underdeveloped).
