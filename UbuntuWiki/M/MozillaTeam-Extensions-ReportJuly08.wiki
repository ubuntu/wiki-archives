* Webdeveloper 1.1.6-3ubuntu1

A total of 14 extensions were suggested on <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MozillaTeam/Extensions/List|our extensions' list]]</nowiki> with the following results. Two of them have all the needing details, and are waiting for a maintainer to package it:

* Flashgot
* Wizz RSS News Reader

Twelve of them need more information before the work on them can start:

* bioFOX
* Beagle addon
* Bookmarks Synchronizer
* ChatZilla
* Foxmarks
* HTML Validator
* Neo Diggler
* NoScript
* Nuke Anything
* Open In Browser
* Tabextensions 3

In the previous month no new extensions were added to the archive. We are currently packaging 10 new extensions for the archive:

* Better Gmail 2
* chickenfoot
* chromatabs
* arenevier
* Console²
* Fireftp
* FireGPG
* Link Widgets

At the time of writing, we're taking care of <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MozillaTeam/Extensions/List|22 extensions]]</nowiki>.

We're always looking for new contributors. If you would like to start packaging extensions, visit our <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MozillaTeam/Extensions/Packaging|packaging page on wiki]]</nowiki>, which explains the packaging process, and join us in #ubuntu-mozillateam on Freenode.
