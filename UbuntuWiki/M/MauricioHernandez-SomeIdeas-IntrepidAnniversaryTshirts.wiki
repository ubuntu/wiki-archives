'''4 years now!!!''' I guess we need a special T-Shirt suitable with the occasion:

Personally, I like the draft #3 but I believe #4 is very much "on your face"-self explanatory for everyone. I still don't know which I'll pick for t-shirt printing but it will be either #3 or #4.

I have attached all SVG's and PNG's in case anyone feels like using these drafts. Please upload and share your designs, too!

'''So, in the end, I picked #4''' :) oh, and colors do look much better on the t-shirt than on the photo
