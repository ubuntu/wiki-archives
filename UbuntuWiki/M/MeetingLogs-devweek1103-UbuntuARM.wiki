=== Dev Week -- Ubuntu ARM and the OMAP4 images -- ogra -- Wed, Mar 2nd, 2011 ===

<pre>
[18:02] <ogra> hey hey
[18:03] <ogra> so i will give a short insight into Ubuntu ARM, the team and the images we care for, i dont expect this to take much time so there should be plenty of time for questions (if there are any)
[18:04] <ogra> the ubuntu arm team (as the name suggests) cares for the arm port in ubuntu
[18:04] <ogra> we build images for different types of arm hardware
[18:04] <ogra> target audience for these images are endusers
[18:05] <ogra> and we try to make them an identical experience to any other ubuntu architecture, so you can expect identical functionallity as in any other ubuntu install
[18:06] <ogra> initially the ubuntu arm team consisted of 8 developers that cared for the whole archive
[18:06] <ogra> all builds (and their failures) as well as all images had to be maintained by this small bunch of people
=== daker is now known as Ghost_of_daker
[18:07] <ogra> recently ARM recognized how important ubuntu was for them, so they started linaro ...
[18:07] <ogra> linaro is a consortium of companies taking care of improving arm and the arm experience
[18:08] <ogra> i.e. nowadays if you get an arm board you will need a linux kernel from the vendor, a so called BSP
[18:08] <ogra> usually that has tons of incompatible changes so the kernel couldnt be merged upstream in linus tree
[18:08] <ogra> and you will also not run a kernel for board A on board B
[18:09] <ogra> linaros mission is to fix such issues
[18:09] <ogra> so that at some point you have someting like the linux-generic package that runs on all arm hardware
[18:09] <ogra> they also care about the toolchain and compiler to get the best optimization out of them
[18:10] <ogra> and they help a lot with failures to build from source
[18:10] <ogra> so since linaro is around, the work of the ubuntu-arm team got a lot easier, we stand on their sholders now
[18:10] <ogra> ...
[18:11] <ogra> over the recent releases we built images for a variety of boards ... starting with freescales imx51 babbage board, marvells dove board (which is known from the press as armada board nowadays) and the very popular beagleboard from TI
=== cmagina-lunch is now known as cmagina
[18:12] <ogra> with maverick we started to work closely with TI to make ubuntu the reference platform for their OMAP4 pandaboard
[18:12] <ogra> this was released in 10.10 and gets improved in 11.04 now
[18:12] <ogra> as architectures come and go the babbage and dove architectures vanished from our list of ports, omap 3 and 4 persist
[18:13] <ogra> if you want to help out with arm development i would highly suggest to take a look at the pandaboard on http://pandaboard.org
[18:13] <ogra> its is available for $175 and has all HW you can imagine
[18:14] <ogra> with the ubuntu install and the TI addons it is fully capable of playing 1080p video
[18:14] <ogra> so if you are intrested in arm development on ubuntu a beagleboard (see beagleboard.org) or a panda is the way to go
[18:15] <ogra> for people that cant afford hardware we also worked out cross ways of building and testing arm packages, the qemu-kvm-extras-static package brings all you need to run an arm chroot on your x86 boax
[18:15] <ogra> for testing and devevlopment thats a good start
[18:16] <ogra> for the highly embedded thinking people linaro offers a cross toolchain and the xdeb packages that makes it possible to cross build packages for arm on an x86 host
[18:17] <ogra> if you are intrested in tryinf out our images you can find install instructions and download links at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ARM/OMAP it sill always list links to the different release centric instructions
[18:17] <ogra> ok, enough of me babbling i think :)
[18:18] <ogra> there are some questions
[18:18] <ClassBot> darkdevil75 asked: arm?
[18:19] <ogra> yes :)
[18:19] <ClassBot> monish001 asked: arm port means arm hardware architecture platform?
[18:19] <ogra> right, it means the CPU you carry in your mobile phone, tablet or (rarely) in your netbook
[18:19] <ClassBot> monish001 asked: why is arm hardware important?
[18:20] <ogra> heh, well, as you see above it runs very transparently in many devices ... you can find arm in your dishwasher as well as in your mobile phone or the ipad
[18:20] <ogra> even in TVs
[18:21] <ogra> ARM CPUs usually eat a tenth of the power of an x86 CPU while providing the same computing power
[18:21] <ogra> that means you usually dont need a fan for example
[18:22] <ogra> within the last years ARM CPUs turned from very low profile embedded things into powerful CPUs
[18:22] <ogra> i'm currently typing on a netbook (toshiba ac100) that is powered by an arm dual core cpu and can easily take it up with an atom
[18:22] <ogra> but it only weights 700garms and has no fans
[18:23] <ogra> in the next years you will very likely see arm approaching the server market
[18:23] <ogra> in a datacenter the most power is used to keep the air condition running ... wirth arm CPUs that cost will drop significantly
[18:23] <ogra> ...
[18:24] <ogra> thats why arm is an important arch
[18:24] <ogra> (and in my personal opinion the future)
[18:24] <ClassBot> beachbrake asked: Why are ARM development boards more expensive? (from the point of view of a student)
[18:25] <ogra> well, i dont think the beagle or pandaboards are much more expensive than and intel mainboard+cpu+graphics card+network card
[18:25] <ClassBot> chadadavis asked: are compiler developers (i.e. GNU) also involved, or is Linaro also taking that upon themselves?
[18:25] <ogra> linaro is working with gcc upstream and if you know a bit about arm you will know about codesourcery, they are part of linaro
[18:26] <ogra> so all work done on the compiler is done very closely with all entities that are involved in arm gcc nowadays
[18:26] <ClassBot> bullgard asked: "recently ARM recognized how important ubuntu was for them" <- Why is ARM important for Ubuntu end users?
[18:27] <ogra> well, once you can buy netbooks with arm cpu and have a battery life of 3days you will know ;)
[18:27] <ogra> honestly though, tablets, netbooks and mobile phones are the future
[18:28] <ogra> while ubuntu doesnt offer any UI options for the latter two, having the distro running on such platforms enables the developer community to work on them
[18:29] <ogra> so you can work on your concept of porting unity to a mobile phone if you are intrested for example ;)
[18:29] <ClassBot> fisch246 asked: when will Ubuntu Server support ARM?
[18:29] <ogra> well, theoretically it already does
[18:29] <ogra> you can turn a pandaboard into a server and i.e. use it as webserver etc
[18:30] <ogra> practically we might work on server images in future releases, server has always been on our list of devices to support, currently we only focus on netbook though
[18:30] <ClassBot> bullgard asked: What do you mean by "low profile" in "ARM CPUs turned from very low profile embedded things into powerful CPUs"? ("low profile" appears to have several meanings in English.)
[18:30] <ogra> well, i actually meant "underpowered"
[18:30] <ogra> :)
[18:31] <ogra> arm CPUs in the past were designed exactly for a low power task ... i.e. run your dishwasher or your TV settop box
[18:31] <ogra> there was no focus in running a desktop or full server on them
[18:32] <ogra> (though there were many embedded servers around ... your router might run an embedded arm with a webserver UI)
[18:33] <ogra> over the recent years arm simply "grew up" your smartphone is as powerful as your PC was 5 years ago nowadays and you can play games you wouldnt have imagined a few years ago
[18:33] <ogra> (or watch HD movies or ... or ...)
[18:33] <ClassBot> bullgard asked: Is a Ubuntu image enough software or does one need additional software to run Ubuntu from an ARM board?
[18:33] <ogra> depends what hardware you look at
[18:34] <ogra> the omap3 and 4 images we provide also offer you the missing bits and pieces (closed source drivers etc) in an easy way so you can get up and running within minutes
[18:35] <ogra> though the bare image is always good enough to start working right away
[18:35] <ogra> the install isnt harder than on x86 and it doesnt behave different in userspace
[18:35] <ClassBot> balau asked: Debian is working on ARM ports, too. Is Ubuntu (and Linaro) coordinated with Debian on this front?
[18:35] <ogra> INDEED !!!
[18:36] <ogra> i just returned from the emdebian sprint this weekend where debian, linaro, ubuntu and genesi met for working on improvements of the arm port
[18:36] <ogra> and as with x86 debian is our upstream for packages, even though ubuntu is optimized more
[18:37] <ogra> ubuntu builds focus only on the last two generations of arm cpus while debian tries to be backwards compatible for a lot more boards
[18:37] <ogra> but that goes at the cost of performance
[18:38] <ogra> the first arm port in ubuntu was a nearly unmodified rebuild of debian
[18:38] <ogra> optimizations and architecture specific improvements happened since though
[18:38] <ClassBot> jderose asked: what hardware do you recommend for uTouch + ARM?
[18:39] <ogra> oh, thats hard to say since i dont know what HW utouch supports yet, i would recommend talking to the utouch guys for this
[18:39] <ogra> theoretically all hardware that runs on x86 will also run on arm
[18:40] <ogra> i.e. a usb touchscreen you attach to x86 that is supported by utouch will definitely also work on an arm device
[18:40] <ClassBot> chadadavis asked: Are licenses required to distribute the necessary drivers?
[18:40] <ogra> yes
[18:41] <ogra> powervr (which you might know as poulsbo from the intel world) is the most sold 3D chip in the arm world
[18:41] <ogra> sadly the situation isnt much better than with nvidia drivers here
[18:41] <ogra> the drivers are freely usable but not distributable in images
[18:42] <ogra> so we have a set of PPAs for these and a process that automatically installs them after first boot if you chose so
[18:43] <ogra> in cases where you have to accept an EULA this is shown and you can approve or decline it
[18:43] <ClassBot> jderose asked: speaking of drivers, embedded graphics drivers are a big concern for me... looking at ARM website, I got the impression the Mali-T604 might have fully open-source drivers... do you know if this is true?
[18:43] <ogra> i know there are plans that all drivers should go opensource but i dont know if this is already the case
[18:44] <ogra> in fact there is only one board that just came out that uses the mali engine, the linaro guys might know more about this board
[18:44] <ClassBot> abhinav19 asked: so your work involves working at the kernel level or user space packages also need to be modified ? and also, how can new developers get started if they are interested in contributing or learning ?
[18:44] <ogra> our work involves everything that makes up ubuntu
[18:45] <ogra> from the kernel up to UI we make sure everything works on the platform
[18:46] <ogra> while i'm not particulary a kernel guy we gave persons in the team that cover that area and we have community developers that help out as well
[18:46] <ogra> if you want to get started i would suggest dropping by ion #ubuntu-arm, this is the channel where we all hang out
[18:47] <ogra> and there is also the #linaro channel if you are more intrested in the hardcore lowlevel stuff ... like assembler, hacking on toolchains or any other bit thats very close to the hardware
[18:48] <ogra> jederose said he was hoping i could give him a recommendation for a touchscreen regarding his question above
[18:48] <ogra> i cant really, what i know is that the liliput displays work quite well
[18:49] <ogra> they are mainly for car entertainment, but they are cheap and can do full HD
[18:49] <ogra> (and come with a USB touchscreen by default)
[18:49] <ogra> afaik there is no actual recommendation from TI for pandaboard touchscreens
[18:50] <ogra> you could ask in #pandaboard though :)
[18:50] <ogra> so there are 10min to go but no questions left
[18:51] <ogra> i hope i could give some insight in the ubuntu world of arm, linaro and the omap images, thanks for the questions :)
[18:51] <ClassBot> There are 10 minutes remaining in the current session.
[18:51] <ogra> tsimpson, i think i'm done, feel free to take the stage
[18:52] <tsimpson> give me a minute to get my notes :)
[18:53] <ogra> oh, there is another question ...
[18:53] <ogra> i can answer while tsimpson gets his notes
[18:53] <ClassBot> jderose asked: have the Linaro members (TI, Freescale, IBM, Samsung, etc)... been sympathetic to the importance of fully open-source drivers?  Are you optimistic about improvements on this front?
[18:53] <ogra> i think tehy see the need but after all they are all business people indeed
[18:54] <ogra> in fact though, the powervr situation changed a lot during the last year
[18:54] <ogra> part of that is because of TI pushing for more openess
[18:55] <ClassBot> abhinav19 asked: thanks. well I dont have the capacity to buy ARM hardware right now. So if one wants to do application level development, is there some thing like a simulator or emulator to run on PC ?
[18:55] <ogra> yes, as i noted above, there is the qemu-kvm-extras-static package that gives you a chroot ... and indeed you can run qemu VMs
[18:56] <ClassBot> There are 5 minutes remaining in the current session.
[18:57] <ogra> if there are remaining questions, feel free to come by in #ubuntu-arm at any time, the team is there and happily helps
