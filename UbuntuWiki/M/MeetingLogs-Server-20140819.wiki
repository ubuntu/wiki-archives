08/19/14 16:07:57 <smoser>	psivaa, ?
08/19/14 16:08:03 <psivaa>	smoser: only minor issue is that during minimal installation test of utopic-amd64 the installed size is showing ~4.5k bloated
08/19/14 16:08:12 <psivaa>	smoser: could not figure out when exactly this was introduced since we had had the install tests broken for a bit
08/19/14 16:08:38 <smoser>	how much bigger is that than the trusty install ?
08/19/14 16:08:56 <psivaa>	smoser: 4.5 k
08/19/14 16:08:58 <smoser>	if we're talking about a few k here or there, its not necessarily any specific addition or deletion.
08/19/14 16:09:21 <smoser>	are you sure? as in there was exactly zero buffer in the trusty minimal install to make the target ?
08/19/14 16:10:13 <psivaa>	not sure if understand the question
08/19/14 16:10:27 <smoser>	you said utopic is ~4.5k "bloated".
08/19/14 16:10:41 <psivaa>	smoser: yes when compared to trusty i mean
08/19/14 16:11:06 <smoser>	oh. ok. well, do you consider that explicitly a bug ?
08/19/14 16:11:39 <psivaa>	smoser: not really, just wanted to point
08/19/14 16:12:01 <smoser>	theres automated test output for that ?
08/19/14 16:12:05 <smoser>	do you have link ?
