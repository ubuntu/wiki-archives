=== Open Week -- Getting Started Translating Ubuntu -- David Planella -- Tue, May 3 ===
<pre>
[15:02] <ClassBot> Logs for this session will be available at http://irclogs.ubuntu.com/2011/05/03/%23ubuntu-classroom.html following the conclusion of the session.
[15:03] <dpm> hello everyone!
[15:04] <dpm> Welcome to the first session on the second day of Ubuntu Open Week
[15:04] <dpm> let's wait for a couple of minutes for people to come in...
[15:05] <dpm> we're going to talk about something very exciting today: Ubuntu translations
[15:05] <dpm> I've reserved some time at the end of the session for questions,
[15:06] <dpm> but if you've got any question during the session, please feel free to ask
[15:06] <dpm> just prepend it with QUESTION: and post it on the #ubuntu-classroom-chat channel
[15:07] <dpm> so let's start with presentations first ;)
[15:07] <dpm> My name is David Planella, and I work as the Ubuntu Translations Coordinator at Canonical, in the Community team
[15:07] <dpm> there I have the pleasure to work with Ubuntu legends such as Jorge Castro, Daniel Holbach, Ahmed Kamal and least but not last our fearless leader, Jono Bacon.
[15:08] <dpm> and also very importantly, I get to work with the not less legendary Ubuntu translation teams
[15:09] <dpm> So be very welcome to this session on Ubuntu Translations, where we'll see
[15:09] <dpm> how Ubuntu can be translated into almost any language,
[15:09] <dpm> the work of our awesome translation teams,
[15:09] <dpm> how Launchpad can be used to translate Ubuntu in a distributed manner,
[15:10] <dpm> and how to get started translating Ubuntu
[15:10] <dpm> You can also follow this presentation through the slides at:

[15:10] <dpm> (if I've forgotten to welcome in your language, do write a big "welcome" in #ubuntu-classroom chat, and I'll include it here too :)
[15:12] <dpm> Ubuntu has a very diverse community, and one of the aspects this diversity is directly reflected is in the number of languages it is translated into, and the communities built around them.
[15:13] <dpm> "Every computer user should be able to use their software in the language of their choice" lies at the very core of the Ubuntu philosophy
[15:14] <dpm> http://www.ubuntu.com/community/ubuntustory/philosophy
[15:14] <dpm> which is why we encourage the creation of translation communities and provide them resources to ease the process of translation into their own language
[15:14] <dpm> so that anyone, without requiring advanced technical skills, can start contributing from day one.
[15:15] <dpm> So let's try to answer some basic questions...
[15:16] <dpm> oh, I meant I was going to answer some questions, but we've got one already from the audience :)
[15:16] <ClassBot> bullgard4 asked: Into how many languages is Ubuntu translated?
[15:17] <dpm> Ubuntu is fully translated into 43 languages. However, there are many, many more in which the translation can be considered good. Here you can see the detailed statistics:
[15:17] <dpm> http://people.canonical.com/~dpm/stats/ubuntu-11.04-translation-stats.html
[15:18] <dpm> so hopefully this session will help you guys make that list grow ;)
[15:18] <dpm> anyway, back to talking about basic questions:
[15:18] <dpm> ======================
[15:18] <dpm> Who translates Ubuntu?
[15:18] <dpm> ======================
[15:18] <dpm> That's an easy one: Ubuntu Translators.
[15:19] <dpm> They are volunteers who organise themselves in translation teams, appointed to be responsible for the translation of a given language.
[15:19] <dpm> And they just rock
[15:19] <dpm> You can see the full list of Ubuntu translation teams here:
[15:19] <dpm> https://translations.launchpad.net/+groups/ubuntu-translators
[15:20] <dpm> We've currently got about 150, of about 220 registered languages for Ubuntu in Launchpad, our online translation tool
[15:20] <dpm> So if there isn't an Ubuntu translation team for your language, now is the chance to create one :)
[15:20] <dpm> But more on that later
[15:20] <dpm> Also very important to mention is the work of upstream translators, whose effort Ubuntu benefits greatly from.
[15:21] <dpm> Ubuntu includes the best-of-breed Open Source software of the many independent projects available, which is what we call upstream.
[15:21] <dpm> Translations are no exception, and if these upstream projects are translated outside of Ubuntu, we import and use the awesome work of upstream translators
[15:22] <dpm> Let's see some numbers about our amazing translations community:
[15:22] <dpm> nearly 18.000 translators who've submitted at least one translation,
[15:22] <dpm> coming from more than 240 countries.
[15:22] <dpm> A default Ubuntu installation contains about 160.000 translatable messages,
[15:23] <dpm> which can go up to 475.000 when adding applications not installed by default such as GIMP, Inkscape, etc.
[15:23] <dpm> And here's an overview of how well translated Ubuntu 11.04 (Natty Narwhal) is in each language:
[15:23] <dpm>   http://people.canonical.com/~dpm/stats/ubuntu-11.04-translation-stats.html
[15:24] <dpm> same link as before
[15:24] <dpm> So you see that there's a lot of work to do, and _you_ can help in making Ubuntu better supported in your language.
[15:24] <dpm> Let's see how...
[15:24] <dpm> =========================
[15:24] <dpm> How is Ubuntu translated?
[15:24] <dpm> =========================
[15:24] <dpm> We use our very own translations tool: Launchpad Translations
[15:25] <dpm> Launchpad Translations allows you to easily translate projects online
[15:25] <dpm> and seamlessly build and organise translation communities around them.
[15:25] <dpm> It also allows translating Operating Systems, Ubuntu being the most evident example.
[15:25] <dpm> You can start translating Ubuntu here:
[15:25] <dpm>     https://translations.launchpad.net/ubuntu
[15:26] <dpm> There you'll see a list of translatable applications and documentation, ordered by priority and ready to translate
[15:26] <dpm> Take some time to look at the list, I'm sure this will bring questions later on :-)
[15:27] <dpm> Alternatively, you can go directly to translatable applications in Launchpad from your desktop.
[15:27] <dpm> If you've been following the slides, you'll see how to do it on slide #6
[15:27] <dpm> If you open an application and go to Help > Translate this application...,
[15:28] <dpm> your browser will be started and it will take you to the Launchpad Translations page for that application.
[15:28] <dpm> Which is pretty neat
[15:28] <dpm> You can try this: open Gedit, go to "Help > Translate this application..." and see it for yourself.
[15:28] <dpm> On the browser window that opens you can start submitting translation suggestions from day one.
[15:28] <dpm> This will take you to the translation page in your preferred language
[15:29] <dpm> which you can then click on and you'll see the list of translatable applications
[15:29] <dpm> your language in Launchpad
[15:29] <dpm> *for your language in Launchpad
[15:30] <dpm> using the standard translations terminology, these are called 'translation templates', or just 'templates'
[15:30] <dpm> and are the translatable units translators work with
[15:30] <dpm> I'd really recommend you to try to using Launchpad for online translation
[15:30] <dpm> it is really easy and flexible
[15:31] <dpm> and it allows saving your work, even before it is reviewed, facilitating the QA work
[15:31] <dpm> that said, if you prefer translating offline, Launchpad Translations is flexible enough to let you download PO files (text files used for translations)
[15:31] <dpm> to be used in offline translation tools
[15:31] <dpm> but that's material for another presentation
[15:31] <dpm> Let's move on...
[15:32] <dpm> =====================
[15:32] <dpm> How can I contribute?
[15:32] <dpm> =====================
[15:33] <dpm> As in any Open Source project, communication is key for collaboration.
[15:33] <dpm> and translations are no different
[15:33] <dpm> While everyone can submit translation suggestions in Launchpad,
[15:34] <dpm> (well, everyone with a Launchpad account)
[15:34] <dpm> We do not only want to provide the best translated OS, but also the best quality of translations.
[15:34] <dpm> So we also encourage translation teams to communicate through any means appropriate
[15:34] <dpm> most teams use a mailing list
[15:34] <dpm> but others also forums, IRC, etc.
[15:35] <dpm> and most of them have also got a wiki page in the Ubuntu namespace
[15:35] <dpm> where they coordinate their work
[15:35] <dpm> just as an example:
[15:35] <dpm> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuCatalanTranslators
[15:36] <dpm> With all that I mean that while the first step in contributing is to submit translation suggestions,
[15:36] <dpm> at https://translations.launchpad.net/ubuntu/
[15:37] <dpm> the next step in contributing to Ubuntu Translations is to get in touch with the translation team for your language,
[15:37] <dpm> and tell them you'd like to contribute.
[15:38] <dpm> It's easy: you can just find them on
[15:38] <dpm>     https://translations.launchpad.net/+groups/ubuntu-translators
[15:38] <dpm> On that page, you can just click on the links under the "Team/Supervisor" column and they will take you to the Launchpad page for the team
[15:39] <dpm> You see that finding the language is quite simple, it's on the column on the left
[15:39] <dpm> and most translation teams are named
[15:39] <dpm> "Ubuntu <language> translators"
[15:39] <dpm> where <language> is the name of the language they translate into
[15:39] <dpm> on their Launchpad page you'll find all the info you'll need to get in touch with them
[15:40] <dpm> As an example:
[15:40] <dpm> https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-l10n-it
[15:40] <dpm> If there isn't a team for your language yet, you should definitely start one
[15:40] <dpm> You can do it by following these simple steps:
[15:40] <dpm>     https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Translations/KnowledgeBase/StartingTeam
[15:40] <dpm> it is a one-off step, which shouldn't take long
[15:41] <dpm> and after the new team has been appointed, you can start translating in Launchpad straight away
[15:41] <dpm> If that step gets too technical for you, do not worry
[15:41] <dpm> You can always get in touch with the global translations community and ask for help or advice, which is always a good idea
[15:41] <dpm> Also if you want to start any discussion on Ubuntu Translations
[15:41] <dpm> In true Ubuntu spirit, everyone is welcome there, and you'll get to know lots of interesting people from all over the globe :)
[15:41] <dpm> Here's how to get in touch with the global translations community:
[15:42] <dpm>     https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Translations/Contact
[15:42] <dpm> And while you have a look at that, we'll enter the last part of this session
[15:42] <dpm> ===
[15:42] <dpm> Q&A
[15:42] <dpm> ===
[15:43] <dpm> So I hope that that gave you a taste of how translation works in Ubuntu and how you can join our awesome translators.
[15:43] <dpm> Now feel free to ask any questions about anything related to translations.
[15:43] <dpm> Bring them on! ;-)
[15:43] <ClassBot> brousch asked: Is a presentation about offline translations and .po files scheduled? If so, when will it be?
[15:44] <dpm> I don't have any planned right now, but it might be a good idea. However, I'd very much recommend to translate online to get your translations accepted straight away without having to wait
[15:44] <dpm> That said, if you've got any questions about offline translation
[15:45] <dpm> I'll be happy to answer them here :)
[15:47] <ClassBot> brousch asked: How do you recruit translators?
[15:47] <dpm> that's actually a very good question
[15:47] <dpm> it really depends on the translation team and how it works
[15:48] <dpm> but there are a few best practice tips that can be helpful for recruiting new contributors for your language:
[15:48] <dpm> * create a dedicated translation team in your loco
[15:48] <dpm> * set up a mailing list or another channel for communication
[15:49] <dpm> * set up translation goals for the team
[15:49] <dpm> * keep the communication flowing
[15:49] <dpm> * organize translation events: a good idea is to organize translation jams during the Ubuntu Global Jam
[15:50] <dpm> they are extremely helpful to meet new people and mentor them on how to start translating Ubuntu
[15:51] <dpm> * promote your translation effort: encourage people to participate by blogging and communicating about it
[15:51] <dpm> * Organize regular IRC translation jams or meetings with your team
[15:51] <dpm> These are just a few that come to mind, which can be helpful in keeping a healthy translation team
[15:52] <ClassBot> kkitano asked: Are the majority of ubuntu translators translating into their native languages, or is there also a mix of translators who are not native speakers but are fluent in another language or who have studied it?
[15:52] <ClassBot> There are 10 minutes remaining in the current session.
[15:53] <dpm> Most of the Ubuntu translators I know are native speakers, but I also know of cases of non-native speakers that are part of a translation team. In the latter case, though, they need to be very fluent in the language
[15:53] <ClassBot> uuser2233 asked: Is there any particular reason as to why there is one language package for all software preinstalled on ubuntu and not seperate ones like for the rest?
[15:54] <dpm> in fact, there are at least 3 language packs for each language (base, kde and gnome), but let me answer the question without entering into much detail:
[15:55] <dpm> having separate language packs from the main applications
[15:55] <dpm> allow us to do something unique amongst Linux distros: deliver regular updates of translations that can be kept separate of applications
[15:56] <dpm> This makes it much easier to provide frequent translation updates without having to reupload a big number of packages, with all the overhead that this would involve
[15:56] <ClassBot> jibel asked: What's the process if, as a user, I find an error with a translation for my language.
[15:56] <dpm> excellent question :)
[15:57] <dpm> You can do either of these:
[15:57] <ClassBot> There are 5 minutes remaining in the current session.
[15:57] <dpm> a) Directly contact the translation team for the language and give them a heads up so that they can fix it.
[15:57] <dpm> (You can find the contact data for all teams at https://translations.launchpad.net/+groups/ubuntu-translators, as mentioned earlier)
[15:57] <dpm> or
[15:58] <dpm> b) You can file a bug against the ubuntu-translations project,
[15:58] <dpm> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-translations/+filebug/
[15:58] <dpm> There we'll assign it to the right translation team,
[15:59] <dpm> who'll be notified about it and be able to fix it in Launchpad
=== koolhead11 is now known as koolhead11|afk
[15:59] <dpm> Members of the bugsquad can easily assign the bug to the corresponding ubuntu-l10n-<language> team too
[16:00] <dpm> Ok, so no more time left
[16:00] <dpm> thanks a lot for your participation
[16:00] <dpm> your excellent questions, and see you on the next Ubuntu Open Week!
[16:01] <dpm> I'll now leave you in the expert hands of xdatap and Having Fun With Ubuntu Testing.
