== Main Inclusion Report for sourcepackage ==

=== Requirements ===

# ''Availability:'' <nowiki>[[http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/libg/libgda4/]]</nowiki>; available for all supported architectures
# ''Rationale:''
** This is needed by gnome-python-extras in order to build the pygda4 module. pygda4 replaces the pygda3 module which is included in the package in Jaunty, but pygda4 was never enabled in the new version due to libgda4 not being available in the archive until recently.
** pygda4 is needed by the latest version of glom (<nowiki>[[https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/glom/+bug/391664|LP: #391664]]</nowiki>). The current version of glom has broken dependencies which cannot be resolved easily (such as the lack of pygda3!).
** libgda3 is already in main, although this can be demoted once its rdepends have been migrated to the new API.
0. ''Security:''
** <nowiki>[[http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=libgda|CVE entries]]</nowiki>: <nowiki>[[http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-2958|CVE-2005-2958]]</nowiki>, fixed a long time ago: <nowiki>[[https://edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libgda2/1.2.2-1|libgda2 1.2.2-1]]</nowiki>
** <nowiki>[[http://secunia.com/search/?search=libgda|Secunia history]]</nowiki>: None
** No binaries running as root or suid/sgid. No daemons - this is just a library with some small utils.
** Contains a small binary utility (gda-sql-4.0) for sending SQL queries to database servers via HTTP. The utility can also run an embedded HTTP server for displaying connection information and executing SQL queries.
** Uses external libraries for accessing database content. 
** No source code review performed, but this code is based on the same upstream project as libgda3
0. ''Quality assurance:''
** There are no known situations where the package doesn't work out of the box.
** The package doesn't ask any debconf questions.
** <nowiki>[[http://bugs.debian.org/src:libgda4|Debian bugs]]</nowiki>: None
** <nowiki>[[http://packages.qa.debian.org/libg/libgda4.html|Maintenance in Debian]]</nowiki> is calm.
** <nowiki>[[http://www.gnome-db.org/|Upstream]]</nowiki> is vigorous.
** <nowiki>[[https://bugzilla.gnome.org/buglist.cgi?query_format=advanced;bug_status=UNCONFIRMED;bug_status=NEW;bug_status=ASSIGNED;bug_status=REOPENED;bug_status=NEEDINFO;version=3.99.x;version=4.0.x;version=4.1.x;product=libgda|Upstream bug tracker]]</nowiki>: No showstoppers
** This package does not deal directly with hardware.
** There is a test suite, which is enabled in Ubuntu now. The build will stop on test-suite failures.
0. ''UI standards:''
** User-visible strings are internationalized using standard gettext system.
** Package builds a PO template during package build.
** No desktop file, as it is not an end-user application.
0. ''Standards compliance:'' 
** <nowiki>[[http://www.pathname.com/fhs/|FHS]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[http://www.de.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/|Debian Policy]]</nowiki> compliant
** Packaging system - cdbs.  Patch system - simple-patchsys. No packaging oddities.
0. ''Dependencies:''
** cdbs 

** debhelper 

** dpkg 

** gnome-pkg-tools 

** intltool 

** pkg-config 

** json-glib 

** glib2.0 

** sqlite3 

** libxml2 

** libxslt 

** mysql-dfsg-5.1 

** ncurses 

** postgresql-8.4 

** readline5 

** popt 

** libsoup2.4 

** zlib1g 

** rarian 

** jquery

** All in main.
0. ''Maintenance:''
** Expected to need little maintenance. It is actively maintained upstream and has minimal delta to Debian. Unfortunately it won't be syncable, as Debian used different package names when they introduced libgda4, compared to those already used in the initial Ubuntu upload. We need to maintain the relevant conflicts/replaces. Older versions of libgda have low numbers of bug reports. There are not many users of libgda4 (currently only Anjuta, but gnome-python-extras and glom will use it once it is in main)
** Quality of package monitored by Ubuntu developers, but bugs typically fixed by upstream developers.
** No package bug contact yet in Ubuntu, but bug traffic is low anyway and the packaging is quite simple.
0. ''Background information:''
** The purpose of the package is clear from its debian/control file
** This is known as '''libgda''' upstream. We append the API number to the source package name so that we can ship multiple versions. We currently have libgda3 and libgda4 in the archive.
