=== Cool stuff! ===

This is the place where we hide the cool stuff!

=== Ubuntu-branded merchandise - status ===

Despite some people's reservations that Cafepress does not have top quality kit,
we are going to begin here as an outlet for Ubuntu branded merchandise.
I am clearing such things as VAT issues and then we will set up the ubuntu shop asap.

If anyone knows of other sites that do the same thing as cafepress and can recommend them, no matter what country, please list them below: - LouiseMcCancePrice

=== T-Shirt artwork competition ===

Watch this space...

=== Comments ===

Is this going to be where t-shirts and other merchandise will be developed? Since the CDs are being pressed in the Netherlands, is there a need for a United States distributor of Ubuntu products? I would be very interested in becoming this distributor, if needed. Please contact me. --KevinMulligan

We already have a distributor for the CDs (which are on their way), but since there may be other distribution needs in the future, we appreciate the offer --MattZimmerman

Me and my girlfiend (which is a professional artist) would like to paint and sell at reasonable price a small amount of Ubuntu's T-Shirt, Shirt, Sweat Shirt (and everything else, on request). No industrial production is possible as this clothes will be hand-painted, and personalized if requested. For every stuff sold, we will donate back money to Ubuntu's project. By the way, anybody that would be interested by this stuff can contact me on my e-mail wich is on my UserPages on this wiki. (EDIT : I got my questions answered,  and I had the permission to use Ubuntu logo and name, so we will soon begin to work on this, as soon as we have something to show, I'll post again here) --FlorianSart

See TrademarkPolicy for guidelines on using the logo --MattZimmerman
