=== Open Week -- Conquering the Command Line for Beginners --  mhall119 -- Wed, May 4 ===
{{{#!IRC
[17:02] <ClassBot> Logs for this session will be available at http://irclogs.ubuntu.com/2011/05/04/%23ubuntu-classroom.html following the conclusion of the session.
[17:03] <mhall119> Hello everybody
[17:04] <mhall119> welcome to my session on using the command line
[17:04] <mhall119> now, there's a lot of old stereo-types about Linux, that you have to put all kinds of cryptic stuff into the command line to get things done
[17:05] <mhall119> but in Ubuntu, you can do pretty much everything in the GUI with the mouse, and you'll never ever *need* the command line
[17:05] <mhall119> but, power users still use it all the time
[17:05] <mhall119> why?
[17:05] <mhall119> Well, because it's fast
[17:05] <mhall119> it's fun
[17:05] <mhall119> and, believe it or not, it's easy!
[17:06] <mhall119> this session isn't going to make you masters of the command line
[17:06] <mhall119> but it will make you more comfortable with it
[17:06] <mhall119> and show you some of the cool things you can do with just a handful of commands
[17:06] <mhall119> so, to get things started, lets all pull up a terminal
[17:07] <mhall119> if you're using Unity, you can hit Alt-F2 and type "gnome-terminal"
[17:07] <mhall119> you should also be able to it ctrl-alt-T to get a new terminal window
[17:07] <mhall119> if you're on KDE, alt-f2 then "kterm" should do it
[17:07] <mhall119> if you're on anything else, I'll just assume you know how already ;)
[17:08] <mhall119> everybody able to get a terminal window up?
=== zobbo is now known as zobbo|away
[17:09] <mhall119> I'll take your silence to mean that everybody has a terminal open
[17:09] <mhall119> or that nobody is listening
[17:09] <mhall119> either way, we're moving on
[17:10] <mhall119> first off, type "pwd" and hit enter
[17:10] <mhall119> "pwd" stands for "Present Working Directory", and it tells you where you are in the file system
[17:10] <mhall119> sorry, type "pwd" in your terminal, not IRC
[17:11] <mhall119> You can think of the command line as a super file manager, and just like Nautilus (the GUI file manager), you are always "in a directory"
[17:11] <mhall119> so, pwd tells you which directory you're in
[17:11] <mhall119> next, type "ls" and hit enter
[17:12] <mhall119> "ls" stands of "list" and it'll do exactly that, list what's in your current directory
[17:12] <mhall119> so now you know where you are and what's there
[17:12] <mhall119> next, let's get moving
[17:12] <mhall119> "cd" stands for "change directory"
[17:12] <mhall119> type "cd /tmp/" in your terminal and hit enter
[17:13] <mhall119> that will change your current directory to /tmp/
[17:13] <mhall119> you can verify this by running "pwd" again
[17:13] <mhall119> and you can run "ls" again to see what's in /tmp/
[17:13] <mhall119> /tmp/ is used by a lot of programs as a place to put "temporary" files
[17:13] <mhall119> we're going to use it for the files we're going to play with
[17:14] <mhall119> everybody in /tmp/?
[17:14] <mhall119> any questions so far?
[17:15] <mhall119> ok, let's make a file
[17:17] <mhall119> ok, run "touch test"
[17:17] <mhall119> "touch" creates a new, empty file, in this case we named it "test"
[17:17] <mhall119> next we're going to make a directoy
[17:17] <mhall119> run "mkdir classroom"
[17:18] <mhall119> "mkdir" as it's name implies, makes a directory, in this case we named it "classroom
[17:18] <mhall119> now let's put our test file into our new directory
[17:18] <mhall119> run  "mv test classroom"
[17:18] <mhall119> "mv" means "move", and does exactly that
[17:19] <mhall119> now "cd classroom" to move into that new directory
[17:19] <mhall119> and "ls" to see that "test" is in there
[17:19] <mhall119> now, let's put some content into our test file
[17:20] <mhall119> run: echo "Hello world" > test
[17:20] <mhall119> "echo" just prints out what you pass it, in this case "Hello world"
[17:20] <mhall119> the > is called a redirect, I'll explain what it's doing in a minute
[17:20] <mhall119> but, suffice it to say, that full command puts "Hello world" into our test file
[17:21] <mhall119> you can check that by running "cat test"
[17:21] <mhall119> "cat" will print the contents of a file out for you to see
[17:22] <mhall119> now let's make a copy of our test file
[17:22] <mhall119> run "cp test backup"
[17:22] <mhall119> "cp" stands for copy
[17:22] <mhall119> now if you run "ls", you should see both "test" and "backup"
[17:22] <mhall119> and if you run "cat backup" you should see "Hello world", because that's what was in "test"
[17:23] <mhall119> okay, now that's pretty much the basics of using the command line for file management
[17:23] <mhall119> any questions on that before we get into the fun stuff?
[17:24] <ClassBot> kkitano asked: what does cat stand for?
[17:24] <mhall119> "cat" stands for "concatenate"
[17:25] <mhall119> because you can give "cat" multiple files, and it will print their contents one after the other
[17:25] <mhall119> concatenating them
[17:25] <mhall119> try it out by running "cat test backup", and you'll see "Hello world" twice
[17:25] <mhall119> okay, now for the fun stuff
[17:26] <mhall119> one of the most powerful aspects of the Linux command line is the ability to redirect input and output
[17:26] <mhall119> we did that earlier with >
[17:26] <mhall119> > redirects the output from a command and puts it into a file
[17:26] <mhall119> we used it to put the output from "echo" into our file "test"
[17:27] <mhall119> you can also use >>, which will append to the end of a file, instead of replacing all it's existing content
[17:27] <mhall119> < will take input from a file and pass it to a program
[17:28] <mhall119> finally, the "pipe" symbol: |
[17:28] <mhall119> this will redirect input and output between 2 programs, instead of between a program and a file
[17:29] <mhall119> using pipes, you can chain multiple programs together
[17:30] <mhall119> I'm going to introduce some common command line programs, and show you how to do powerful things by joining them together with pipes
[17:30] <mhall119> our first one is "ps", which will give you a list of running processes
[17:30] <mhall119> go ahead and run "ps"
[17:31] <mhall119> is probably won't show much, because the default settings only show what's running on your current terminal
[17:31] <mhall119> to get a list of everything running on your system, we need to pass it some additional "flags",
[17:31] <mhall119> run "ps -ef" and you'll see a whole lot more information
[17:32] <mhall119> don't worry about what it all is right now
[17:32] <mhall119> we're only going to worry about the first 2 columns, which are the username and the process id or PID
[17:34] <mhall119> next is "grep", which is a very powerful text searching tool
[17:35] <mhall119> try "grep 'world' test"
[17:35] <mhall119> and it'll search the contents of our test file for the word "world"
[17:36] <mhall119> now, let's combine them with pipes to do something useful
[17:36] <mhall119> suppose we want to list all the processes that involve "python"
[17:36] <mhall119> just run "ps -ef |grep python"
[17:36] <mhall119> this will get a list of all the processes on your system, and send that list to grep, which will only print out those lines that contain the word "python"
[17:38] <mhall119> any questions about what we just did?
[17:39] <mhall119> okay, moving on to our next command: "find"
[17:39] <mhall119> "find" will give you a list of files in a directory and all it's sub directoryies
[17:40] <mhall119> fun "find /tmp" and you'll see a lot of information go by
[17:40] <mhall119> that's every file under the /tmp directory
[17:41] <mhall119> now let's say we want to see every file under /tmp/ where the word "test" is in the file name, or in the name of one of it's parent directories
[17:41] <mhall119> we can do this by "piping" the output from find into grep again
[17:41] <mhall119> run "find /tmp |grep test"
[17:42] <mhall119> you will probably see more than just out test file, that's okay
[17:42] <mhall119> another useful command is "file"
[17:43] <mhall119> "file" just tells you what kind of file something is
[17:43] <mhall119> run "file test"
[17:43] <mhall119> and it should tell you that it's an ASCII text file
[17:44] <mhall119> it's important to note that, unlike Windows, Linux doesn't need file extensions to know what kind of file something is
[17:44] <mhall119> run "cp test test.png" to make a copy of our text file called "test.png"
[17:45] <mhall119> if this were Windows, it woud think that test.png is an image
[17:45] <mhall119> but if you run "file test.png", it still knows that it's content is only text
[17:45] <mhall119> okay, we don't need to keep this file around, so remove it by running "rm test.png"
[17:45] <mhall119> "rm" obviously, stands for "remove"
[17:46] <ClassBot> suprengr90 asked: is it worth mention the location on keyboard of "|" as it doesn't show on the keyboard [exactly] the same?
[17:48] <mhall119> on standard US-en keyboards, it's shift+backslash
[17:48] <mhall119> I'm not sure about other keyboard layouts
[17:49] <mhall119> okay, now for some real fun
[17:49] <mhall119> "xargs" is a very handy program that will take each line that it takes as input, and pass it to another program
[17:50] <mhall119> so, let's say we want to know all the python scripts in /usr/bin
[17:51] <mhall119> since the filenames in /usr/bin don't end with .py, even if they're python files, we can't use find+grep like we did before
[17:51] <mhall119> but, using "xargs" and "file", we can check the content type of each
[17:51] <mhall119> so try running: find /usr/bin |xargs file |grep 'python.*script'
[17:51] <mhall119> let me break that down
[17:52] <mhall119> 1) "find /usr/bin" this will produce a list of all the files in /usr/bin
[17:52] <mhall119> we then pass that list to:
[17:52] <ClassBot> There are 10 minutes remaining in the current session.
[17:52] <mhall119> 2) "xargs file", this says for every file in the list, run that file through the "file" command
[17:53] <mhall119> this gives us a list of all the files + their content type information
[17:53] <mhall119> which we pass to
[17:53] <mhall119> 3) "grep 'python.*script'" which will filter the output, displaying only those that contain "python" and "script" with any amount of text between them (the .* part)
[17:54] <mhall119> now, take a minute to think about the number of steps and repetition it would take to do the same from the GUI with a mouse
[17:55] <mhall119> alright, a couple final commands before the session is over
[17:56] <mhall119> the "kill" command takes a process ID, like we say using "ps", and forces the process to end
[17:56] <mhall119> be careful with this command
[17:57] <ClassBot> There are 5 minutes remaining in the current session.
[17:57] <mhall119> but, suppose you wanted to kill all gwibber processes
[17:57] <mhall119> gwibber is the default Ubuntu twitter client
[17:58] <mhall119> we can use "ps -ef |grep gwibber" like we did before to see all the gwibber processes
[17:58] <mhall119> and then run "kill" on each one
[17:58] <mhall119> but that can be tedious
[17:58] <mhall119> instead, let's introduce "awk"
[17:59] <mhall119> awk is a very powerful scripting too, but we're going to use it for something very basic, printing out the 2nd column only from ps
[17:59] <mhall119> the 2nd column is the process id
[17:59] <mhall119> so run: ps -ef |grep gwibber | awk '{print $2}'
[17:59] <mhall119> now you have the process id's for the gwibber processes
[18:00] <mhall119> now we can use xargs again to pass each one to kill
[18:00] <mhall119> (again, don't actually try this)
[18:01] <mhall119> ps -ef |grep gwibber |awk '{print $2}'|xargs kill
[18:01] <mhall119> will find all the gwibber process ids and pass them to the "kill" command
[18:01] <mhall119> now, it's hard to remember all the ways to use commands, not even power users remember them all
[18:01] <mhall119> fortunately, there's easy ways to find out
[18:02] <mhall119> almost every command will take the "--help" flag and give you a short description of how to use it
