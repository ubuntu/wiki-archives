=== Comments ===
20, 30 desktop backgrounds are probably too much. I'd suggest to ship with ~15. Also, lots of the desktop backgrounds on Wikipedia are too turbulent for the use as desktop backgrounds. 
OpenSuSE ships with very nice backgrounds, I think that Ubuntu should do similar. For example, they ship very nice nature photos which are very quiet. I uploaded the ones from OpenSuSE  <nowiki>[[http://gamesplace.info/opensource/opensuse-wallpapers/|here]]</nowiki> . Also, I uploaded a gallery with thumbnails <nowiki>[[http://gamesplace.info/opensource/opensuse-wallpapers/thumbs.html|here]]</nowiki> --MartinJuergens
