State of webkitkde:

=== Quintasan ===
I would say overall state is good. Regular sites work very well with almost no rendering issues.

Web 2.0 sites:
* Twitter - works fine, sometimes it seems like Konq hanged but it works.
* Identi.ca - works fine too, no slowness
* Facebook - mostly works, sometimes I had to terminate Konq
* Google {Maps,Reader,Mail,Notebook,Calendar,Picasa} - work fine, couldn't find any issues
* YouTube - playback and adding comments just fine, I didn't test upload but juding from working uploading to other sites I would say it's just fine
* Hyves - Scrolling is a little slow, but everything works just fine
* KDE-Look - Works fine
* KDE-Apps - Works fine
* GNOME-Look - Works fine
