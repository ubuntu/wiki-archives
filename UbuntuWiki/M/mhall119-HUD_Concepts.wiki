== HUD Menu Discovery ==

=== Initial Display ===

When opening the HUD, it will default to showing one entry for each top-level menu.  Searching from here will be identical to the current search.

=== Sub-menu Display ===

When a top-level menu is selected, that menu's name is added as a bread-crumb in the search bar, and it's own top-level menu items are displayed.

=== Search ===

When in a sub-menu (where there are parent menu bread-crumbs in the search bar), searching happens only on items in that sub-menu's part of the menu tree. Results are displayed in the same way as the current search, as flattened results.  Searching while in a sub-menu will not search indicator menus.
