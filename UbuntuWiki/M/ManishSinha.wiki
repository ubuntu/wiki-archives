=== About ===

'''I am reapplying for Ubuntu Membership'''

I am a Computer Science student at '''Arizona State University'''

I work at <nowiki>[[http://a2c2.asu.edu/resources/saguaro/ | Saguaro Supercomputer Cluster as an Operations Engineer]]</nowiki> 

I love outings, trekking, spending some awesome time with friends. I like Tea and coffee.

{*} I know PHP, Python, C, C# and Vala.

{*} <nowiki>[[ http:--www.markshuttleworth.com-archives-1082 | Praised by Mark Shuttleworth for a major contribution to Ubuntu - Privacy Manager]]</nowiki>

=== Contributions ===
I have been an Ubuntu user since 6.06 days. 

{*} Lead developer of <nowiki>[[https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/03/ubuntu-1204-will-bring-os-level-privacy-options |  Activity Log Manager]]</nowiki> also known as <nowiki>[[http://milky.manishsinha.net/2012/02/07/privacy-and-activity-manager-zeitgeist-release | Ubuntu's Privacy]]</nowiki> which helps people fine tune their privacy settings in Ubuntu.

{*} One of the earliest members of AskUbuntu where I have gained 6362 points where I am at #62 at all times. I have some very popular answers which keep on getting lots of hits 
 - <nowiki>[[http://askubuntu.com/questions/29559/how-can-i-keep-recent-files-from-appearing-in-unity/29576#29576 | How can I keep recent files from appearing in Unity?]]</nowiki>

{*} One of the <nowiki>[[http://zeitgeist-project.com/team/ | core developers of Zeitgeist]]</nowiki> which is one of the very important components which power Unity.

{*} During college days I founded Linux User's Group Manipal (http://lugmanipal.org) with 2 of my friend. We organized lots of Ubuntu Install fests, training session, hands on workshop and spread a lot of awareness amongst the students. The first two posts on lugmanipal.org website are <nowiki>[[http://www.lugmanipal.org/2007/11/16/hello-world/ | this]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[http://www.lugmanipal.org/2007/11/18/lugs-first-meet/ | this]]</nowiki> 

=== Current Work ===

'''Activity Log Manager'''

Working on creating the next version of Privacy Manager of Ubuntu based on the design of Matthew Paul Thomas

'''Zeigeist Manual'''

Work in progress to create a comprehensive manual for Zeitgeist which is an integral part of Ubuntu

'''Zeigeist Explorer'''

Working on a Wireshark like debugger using which you can look at the event logged in real time.

=== Past Work ===
Apart from my contribution to Ubuntu, I primarily give my time these days for the Zeitgeist project which is also being used in Unity in upcoming Natty.

''' Launchpad API '''

I have been working on creating a C# wrapper for Launchpad API. The work is in progress and takes time due to complex nature of Launchpad API. The library to generate code from Launchpad WADL is almost done. The library is called <nowiki>[[ http:--launchpad.net-wadlsharp | wadlsharp ]]</nowiki>

This library has potential and Manuel de La Pena from Canonical DesktopCouch team <nowiki>[[ https:--code.launchpad.net-wadlsharp?field.lifecycle=ALL | has even sent patches]]</nowiki> to enhance it. He told that he might use it for Ubuntu One Client for Windows as it is the only working WADL library for CLI/Mono/C# at the moment

'''apt-offline'''

I am one of the developers of <nowiki>[[https://alioth.debian.org/projects/apt-offline/ | apt-offline]]</nowiki> which is an offline tool to update your ubuntu installation and also install packages to a ubuntu computer without a working internet connection. The project is hosted at Debian Alioth and my <nowiki>[[ https:--github.com-manish-apt-offline-commits-master?page=2 |latest work include creating a GUI]]</nowiki> for the formely command line tool which is now available in <nowiki>[[https://alioth.debian.org/forum/forum.php?forum_id=2927 | version 1.0]]</nowiki>

'''Packaging'''

{*} I have built zeitgeist-sharp packages and tomboy dataproviders in my experimental PPA https://launchpad.net/~manishsinha/+archive/experimental

{*} I am slowly learning packaging and aim to become a MOTU in the future. I something spend some time on #ubuntu-motu trying to learn packaging whenever possible

'''Zeitgeist Sharp'''

I am the primary developer for zeitgeist-sharp which is the Mono wrapper over the Zeitgeist DBus API. 

'''Tomboy Dataprovider'''

I have written a dataprovider for tomboy so that events can be pushed to zeitgeist. Tomboy is the default note taking app on Ubuntu, so this will help Ubuntu users.

'''Banshee Dataprovider'''

I have written a dataprovider for tomboy so that events can be pushed to zeitgeist. It is now upstream at banshee-community-extensions http://gitorious.org/banshee-community-extensions. Coming Natty, Banshee is going to be the default media player, so this extension is going to be pretty much useful.

=== Channels I hang on ===

* #zeitgeist - Freenode
* #ubuntu-desktop - Freenode
* #ubuntu-devel - Freenode
* #elementary - Freenode

=== Testimonials ===

* Manish as far as I ve seen is very helpful on the mailing list answering to people's questions and helping out people in which ever way he can apart from developmental works. I think he will be a great addition to Member squad. A clear +1 from me! Keep rocking mate -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:bhavi]]</nowiki> [02 November 2010]

* I have been working with Manish on Zeitgeist related stuff and he proved himself to be an extremely valuable asset to the team where he not only took over the development of zeitgeist-sharp and the wiki, but also is working himself into the core of the project. We also started working on another project "Cheers - Achievements System" for Ubuntu. The guy makes things happen and has become one of my favorite hackers. His devotion to Ubuntu is already showing and will show off more in the future. <nowiki>[[SeifLotfy|Seif Lotfy]]</nowiki>

* Manish helps people with their support queries in the ##linux-india and #ubuntu-in channels. He is very friendly, and I appreciate his efforts in starting a LUG in his college and spreading Ubuntu. I have seen him working with SeifLotfy on Zeitgeist, and he aims to add Zeitgeist support to many other apps such as Banshee. In all, I strongly think Manish deserves Ubuntu membership. <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:bilalakhtar]]</nowiki>

* Manish has proven a prominent member of the Zeitgeist community, developing C# bindings and data providers from scratch and actively participating in discussions. As per my knowledge he is also active promoting Ubuntu in his local area. His dedication is of great value. <nowiki>[[RainCT|SiegfriedGevatter]]</nowiki>

* Manish has shown that he has dedication and skills. Taking on big tasks for the Zeitgeist project and pulling them through ups and downs and delivering a final product. In communications he is friendly and constructive. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:kamstrup]]</nowiki> 
* Manish is really an awesome guy that I know. He really works more at the back of the Indian community and He helps us a lot in designing a good structure of our community. His contributions in IRC help is great and He really is making all of us to stretch for the community. I fully support Manish for the membership of our community. <nowiki>[[Mohan_chml| Mohi]]</nowiki>

* Manish is friendly, energetic, and has made a very good impression in a short amount of time.  He has great attention to detail and an admirable focus on quality and consistency.  His contributions to <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/dmedia|dmedia]]</nowiki> have kept me on my toes!  Among other things, he has made sure that dmedia <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/dmedia/+bug/677837|complies with xdg standards]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/dmedia/+bug/682115|uses proper D-Bus naming conventions]]</nowiki>, and <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/dmedia/+bug/682119|has a high quality D-Bus API]]</nowiki>. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:jderose]]</nowiki>
