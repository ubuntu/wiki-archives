This policy covers the application process for key MOTU teams (currently SRU and Release). Instructions on how to join motu-release/motu-sru folow.

=== Application Process ===

Should an applicant feel they are qualified for the position, they shall send a email to ubuntu-motu with their intent to join, their reasons on why they feel they are appropriate for the position, a link to their  wiki page which should list their current projects and contributions to Ubuntu, and a link to their launchpad page.

Anyone who wishes to advocate the application shall do so by sending a email in reply to the application, and then note the endorsement on the applicants wiki page. Two endorsements are required for an application to be considered valid, and any MOTU in good standing may advocate an applicant. Once the nomination is received, the floor is opened to all MOTU to post comments and criticisms for a period of one week. Anyone can post comments or criticisms, however criticisms from non-MOTUs are not valid unless backed up by a MOTU in good standing.

If there are any criticisms, or comments that require addressing, it is the responsibility of the applicant to resolve these and respond to the list. An applicant may not have any outstanding valid criticisms: if the issues can not be resolved, the applicant is restricted from joining the team, and their application becomes void.

After a period of 168 hours (one week), or when all criticisms and comments are properly resolved (whichever is longer), the application should be considered accepted, and the team admin will add the user to the Launchpad group. Should the team administration be unable to add the user for whatever reason (i.e, the admin is currently MIA, or the admin was the one who resigned), responsibility for the membership change falls to the MOTU council.

If the acceptance of a candidate would push the team oversize, a multicandidate election is held, with a number of winners equal to the maximum size of the team selected from the current members and any new applications.  This election may be delayed if there are multiple open applications at one time until all of said applications are properly processed in accordance with the above.

As of 8/21/2008, both motu-sru, and motu-release are capped at five team members. This may be increased if necessary by consensus of the team in question, or by the MOTU council.

=== Resignation ===

Any active key team member may resign at any time by leaving the Launchpad group for the team, and posting a email to ubuntu-motu detailing the resignation. Once a resignation is posted to ubuntu-motu, its considered final, and the position is now open to anyone wish meets the requirements and wishes to apply.  If such a posting is made without the associated self-removal from the Launchpad team, an admin for the team is to make the adjustment.

=== Forced Removal ===

Should a current team member be deemed unfit for the position, any MOTU in good standing may, at their discretion, post a Request for Removal against the individual to the ubuntu-motu mailing list. This post should contain clear and specific details on why a removal is justified, any attempts to resolve the issue before bringing it to ubuntu-motu, and references to bugs/irc conversations/etc. with respect to the issues. Should the issues not be able to handled within ubuntu-motu, the MOTU council will decide the validity of any removal request.

Removal requests should only be done on technical grounds unless there is an overwhelming issue with a team members conduct that makes him unfit for the position. Filing a removal request should not be done lightly.
