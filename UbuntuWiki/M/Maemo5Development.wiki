Instructions to get a Maemo5 Development environment running with Ubuntu.
This will concentrate on 3D graphics development.

== Suggested Hardware ==
As we need OpenGL ES2.0 compatible extensions, the hardware must at least support OpenGL2.0. Although the Open Source Intel driver should provide this, I would recommend a graphic chip from this list:

<nowiki>[[http://www.nvidia.com/object/linux_display_ia32_173.14.25.html|latest Nvidia Graphic Drivers]]</nowiki> (click on Supported Products)

== Read this ==
before you continue you should read at least the headlines of the following links, as they cover the problems you will encounter.
Note: there is also the possibility do <nowiki>[[http://wiki.maemo.org/Documentation/Maemo5_Final_Installation#Installing_Maemo_5_SDK_on_non-Linux_operating_systems|run Ubunt+Maemo5SDK in a virtual machine]]</nowiki>. (though I have not tested it)
* http://wiki.maemo.org/Documentation/Maemo5_Final_Installation
* http://wiki.maemo.org/Qt4_Hildon#Using_the_Qt_4.6_tech_preview_in_Fremantle

== Software Installation ==
you will need Ubuntu Lucid(10.04) for Qt4.6 as it contains the qt4-opengl bindings.

* <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/lucid/beta2|Lucid Beta2 release]]</nowiki> (scheduled for 08.04, link does not work yet)
* <nowiki>[[http://www.forum.nokia.com/info/sw.nokia.com/id/c05693a1-265c-4c7f-a389-fc227db4c465/Maemo_5_SDK.html|Maemo5 SDK]]</nowiki> (use the GUI Installer)
* <nowiki>[[http://wiki.maemo.org/Qt4_Hildon#Fremantle|Install Qt4.6 on Maemo SDK/ Device]]</nowiki> (should be obsolete with the Maemo 1.2 Update)
* Install the qt4-opengl package in scratchbox/ on the device (from extras-devel)
* Install artolkitplus-dev in scratchbox and artoolkitplus on the device (from extras-devel)

== Binaries on the Device ==
there are two ways of getting the binaries on the device
* creating a deb packagage
* copying the files manually on the device
common for both ways is that the binaries are put somewhere outside of /home/ as /home is mounted with the noexec flag for safety reasons.
I recommend to put the binaries and additional files in /opt/<program_name> (in both cases).

The easiest way to copy random files on the device is to install openssh-server on the device and then mount it using sshfs or the corresponding Ubuntu GUI tool. (Places->Connect to Server..)
