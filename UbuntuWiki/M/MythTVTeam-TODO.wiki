| Backport edgy version of mythtv 0.20 to dapper.
| Mario Limonciello & John Dong
| 12-7-06: dependencies have been built and are in dapper-backports.  Waiting for libiec61883 to move from new queue to build mythtv and mythplugins
|-
| Add metapackages to automatically set up mythtv "profiles" or "roles".  See the mythtv edgy documentation to better explain what these roles are.
| Mario Limonciello
| 12-7-06 Currently in bzr branch. No binaries yet.
|-
| Backing up the database regularly is very important to maintain MythTV's functionality - it might be a good idea to offer the user the chance to set up a nightly/weekly cron job to back up the database.
| Mario Limonciello
| 12-7-06 Currently in bzr branch.  A cron job is created that will do this.  No binaries yet.
|-
| IVTV modules + firmware in edgy/dapper
| Mario Limonciello
| 12-15-06: Licensing has been straightened out for firmware.  Firmware is now hosted in debian packages at dl.ubuntu.com/firmware.  New versions also in debian packages there.

| Generate the 'random' mythtv user mysql password & display it, and tell the user where it's stored
| Mario
| 04-07
|-
| Check what users are in the mythtv group, and offer to add users if they arent in it during *initial* mythtv-common installation.  Later dpkg-configure mythtv-common should also do this.
| Mario
| 04-07
|-
| Verify that if the mythtv user already exists when mythtv is being installed, that the 'mythtv' user is made a member of the 'video' & 'audio' groups.  Eg the mythtv user was created by hand before starting.

=== Superseeded tasks ===
 1. Move lirc modules into linux-restricted-modules.
** Currently has a bug opened: https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/linux-restricted-modules-2.6.17/+bug/69534
** Patch was created, but is being taken over by the MediaCenter team

 2. Create a python based lircd.conf parser for writing a .lircrc.  This will parse remote information and produce a list of all possible buttons.  These will be easily assignable to different applications.  A database will be internally maintained in the app for the possible buttons in each app.
** Taken over by the MediaCenter team

=== Docs To Be Written ===
* Work on website, http://www.mythbuntu.org

=== Proposed tasks ===
==== Feisty + 1 ====

 1. Create a ubiquity derived installer to install directly into a mythtv "profile" or "role"
 4. Create a myth debconf that will automate setting the mysql-server bindaddress and securing mysql-server.

==== UDEV ====

1. Do some testing into whether mixed types of tv tuner devices can happily coexist (e.g. ivtv & DVB) AND be relied on to appear at the same device nodes repeatedly.  Tuners 'moving around' is a major source of confusion for users (it was for Juski for a while too!). 
* In progress: keescook 

2. Investigate ways to automate 'manual' (/etc/modprobe list) module loading (and by necessity, blacklisting) - to work around the above?

==== debconf stuff ====

1. Ask the user if they want to secure mysql if they do not have a root password.  Warn about security issues!

3. Ask the user if the system is to be a standalone PVR or part of a MythTV network and configure bind-address in my.cnf accordingly

4. Configure the .htaccess file for mythweb so it uses the correct password from the very start.

5. Ask the user if they'd like to secure mythweb (htpasswd?).

6. Possibly check the filesystem on the recording partition & if it's ext3, enable 'gradual file deletes' in MythTV
 (database setting)

==== Other Ideas ====

* More themes.  A package has been submitted to revu.
