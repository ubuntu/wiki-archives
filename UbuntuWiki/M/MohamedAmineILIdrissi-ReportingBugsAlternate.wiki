== How to report bugs ==

Ubuntu uses Launchpad to keep track of bugs and their fixes. This page will guide you through the steps required to file a good and detailed report.

=== Using Kubuntu? ===

If you use Kubuntu, please see the Kubuntu variant of this page <nowiki>[[https://wiki.kubuntu.org/Kubuntu/Bugs/Reporting|here]]</nowiki>.

=== 1. Create a Launchpad account ===

If you don't already have one - you need to <nowiki>[[https://help.launchpad.net/YourAccount/NewAccount|create a Launchpad account]]</nowiki>. This will allow you to file new bugs and comment on existing ones.

=== 2. Determine if your bug is really a bug ===

You should not file a bug if you are:

* '''Requesting new software:''' you should follow the guidelines at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopment/NewPackages
* '''Requesting support:''' there are a multitude of ways you can get support, such as the <nowiki>[[https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu|Launchpad answer tracker]]</nowiki>, the <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntuforums.org/|Ubuntu forums]]</nowiki>, the <nowiki>[[irc:--irc.freenode.net-#ubuntu|#ubuntu]]</nowiki> channel on the <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InternetRelayChat|Freenode IRC]]</nowiki> server, the <nowiki>[[http://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-users|ubuntu-users]]</nowiki> mailing list, and the <nowiki>[[http://ubuntu.stackexchange.com|Ubuntu Stack Exchange]]</nowiki> site.
* '''Discussing features and existing policy:''' this belongs to the <nowiki>[[http://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-devel-discuss|ubuntu-devel-discuss]]</nowiki> mailing list.
* '''Proposing features and ideas:''' you should submit your idea to <nowiki>[[http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/|Ubuntu Brainstorm]]</nowiki> or to the <nowiki>[[http://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-devel-discuss|ubuntu-devel-discuss]]</nowiki> mailing list.
* '''Filing a bug against a program not provided by an Ubuntu package:''' You should file a bug in that program's bug tracking interface. Instructions are generally available on the program's web site.

/!\ If you want to file a translation or misspelling bug, follow the instructions <nowiki>[[#translation|here]]</nowiki>.
 
=== 3. Make sure your bug hasn't already been reported ===

When filing a bug, please make sure it has not already been reported by searching through the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+bugs|existing bugs]]</nowiki> and the release notes for your version of Ubuntu:
* <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperReleaseNotes| Ubuntu 6.06 LTS (Dapper Drake)]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes/804|Ubuntu 8.04 LTS (Hardy Heron)]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes/904|Ubuntu 9.04 (Jaunty Jackalope)]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes/910|Ubuntu 9.10 (Karmic Koala)]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes/1004|Ubuntu 10.04 LTS (Lucid Lynx)]]</nowiki> 

If you have further information about an already reported bug, add this information to the existing report, rather than opening a new one.

/!\ '''For sound, X drivers, and kernel bugs''': please open a '''new''' bug instead of commenting on a similar bug: chances are that your hardware does not match the existing bug's hardware, so your bug will not be addressed.

<nowiki>[[#Top|Back to top]]</nowiki>

=== 4. Collect information about the bug ===

The method of reporting bugs in Ubuntu is by using the tool "ubuntu-bug", otherwise known as '''Apport'''. When reporting a bug, you must tell Apport which program or <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallingSoftware#What%20is%20a%20package?|package]]</nowiki> is at fault.

==== Collecting information from a specific package ====

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <style="border: 1px solid black"><nowiki>[[File:ubuntu-bug.png|Filing a bug with the "Run Application" window]]</nowiki>
|}

Press Alt+F2 to open the "Run Application" window, pictured above.  Type `ubuntu-bug `''`<package name>`'' and click ''Run''. If you're not sure which package has the problem,
refer to the instructions for <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bugs/FindRightPackage|finding the right package]]</nowiki>.

==== Collecting information from a currently running program ====

To file a bug against a program that is currently running, go to '''System > Administration > System Monitor''', and find the ID of the process.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <style="border: 1px solid black"><nowiki>[[File:system-monitor-id.png | System Monitor Processes tab ]]</nowiki>
|}

Then type the process ID instead of the package name into the "Run Application" window.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <style="border: 1px solid black"><nowiki>[[File:ubuntu-bug-pid.png | Filing a bug with the "Run Application" window and a process ID]]</nowiki>
|}

==== Filing a general bug against no particular package ====

If you're not sure which package is affected by the bug, type `ubuntu-bug` in the "Run Application" window and click ''Run''. This will guide you through a series of questions to gather more information about your bug.

<nowiki>[[#Top|Back to top]]</nowiki>

=== 5. Complete the bug filing process ===

After running one of the above commands, Apport (the Ubuntu bug reporter) will gather information about your bug.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <style="border: 1px solid black"><nowiki>[[File:apport-1.png | Apport collecting information about the bug]]</nowiki>
|}

A window will then pop up, asking you if you want to report the bug. Click "Send Report" if you wish to proceed, or click "Content of the report" if you want to review the information Apport collected.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <style="border: 1px solid black"><nowiki>[[File:send-problem-question.png | Apport asking you to send the report]]</nowiki>
|}

Apport will then upload the problem information to Launchpad, and a new browser window will then open to inform you that the bug is being processed.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <style="border: 1px solid black"><nowiki>[[File:information-upload.png | Apport uploading the problem information]]</nowiki>
|}

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <style="border: 1px solid black"><nowiki>[[File:process-data.png | Launchpad processing the bug data]]</nowiki>
|}

After the bug data has been processed, a new page will open that will ask you for the bug's title. When you're done, click "Next".

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <style="border: 1px solid black"><nowiki>[[File:bug-title.png | Launchpad asking for a bug title]]</nowiki>
|}

A search will then occur based on the title you gave to the bug, and will show potentially similar ones. If one of these seems to be the exact bug you're reporting, click its title, then "Yes, this is the bug I'm trying to report". If not, click "No, I need to report a new bug".

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <style="border: 1px solid black"><nowiki>[[File:bug-search.png | Launchpad search results about the bug title]]</nowiki>
|}

Launchpad will then ask you for further information. It's important that you specify three things:

# What you expected to happen
# What actually happened
# The minimal series of steps necessary to make it happen, where step 1 is "start the program"

Fill in the description field with as much information as you can, including the release of Ubuntu you are using and steps for someone else to recreate the bug.  It is better to have too much information in the description than not enough.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <style="border: 1px solid black"><nowiki>[[File:more-informations.png | Launchpad asking for further information]]</nowiki>
|}

At then bottom of the page, there is some extra options you can use to make your bug report more complete:

* '''This bug is a security vulnerability:''' Please check this '''''only''''' if your bug report describes a behaviour that could be exploited to crack your system. (TODO: better wording?)
* '''Tags:''' You can add here <nowiki>[[http://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bugs/Tags|tags]]</nowiki> that pertain to your bug report. The predefined values are fine most of the time.
* '''Include an attachment:''' Using this option, you can add supporting attachments to explain or help others reproduce your bug. This might include a screenshot, a video capture of the problem or a sample document that triggers the fault. Additional attachments, if necessary, can be added after the bug is reported via '''Add a comment/attachment''' at the bottom of the page.

{| class="wikitable"

|}

When you're done, click "Submit bug report".

== Tips and tricks ==

=== Filing bugs when off-line ===

In the event that you have an issue with your internet connection or want to file a bug for another system you can still do this using apport.  Using the command `apport-cli -f -p` ''`<package name>`'' on the target system will collect information and provide you with an option to "K: Keep report file for sending later or copying to somewhere else".  The report is then saved on the target system, in your ''/tmp'' directory which is cleared out on reboot,  with a .apport extension.  After copying it to a different system you can file that report using `ubuntu-bug ` ''`<location of apport file>`''.

=== Filing bugs at Launchpad.net ===

If for some reason you cannot file a bug using the ''Apport'' tool you can file one via <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+filebug/?no-redirect | Launchpads own bug report form]]</nowiki>. When doing so it is best if you have determined which package it should be filed against. Read '<nowiki>[[http://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bugs/FindRightPackage|finding the right package]]</nowiki>' for guidance or use <nowiki>[[ http:--launchpad.net-ubuntu- | Launchpad's package search feature ]]</nowiki>.

To file a bug against a specific package you can also use a URL like the following:

  `http://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/PACKAGENAME/+filebug?no-redirect`

where PACKAGENAME is the name of the source package about which you want to file the bug.  

In the event that you want to request a piece of software be packaged for Ubuntu please follow the instructions in the <nowiki>[[ https:--wiki.ubuntu.com-UbuntuDevelopment-NewPackages#Requesting%20a%20new%20package%20for%20Ubuntu | wiki ]]</nowiki>.

=== Using the help menu in the affected application (development releases only) ===

If you want to report a bug on an application that is ''running and responding'', use the application's help menu: '''Help -> Report a problem'''.

<nowiki>[[File:report-a-problem.png]]</nowiki>

This method is preferable to filing a bug at the Launchpad website - it automatically attaches relevant information, which helps analyze the problem.

If an application crashes, and you're using a version of Ubuntu which is actively under development, <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Apport|Apport]]</nowiki> will start automatically, raising an appropriate bug report for you to complete in Launchpad.  This provides developers with rich debugging information that will make it easier to fix the problem.

=== Adding Apport Debug Information to an Existing Launchpad Bug ===

If you have already reported a bug directly via Launchpad, but want to add additional debugging information via ''Apport'' to the bug, you can do this by running the command `apport-collect bug_number` via "Run Application" or terminal window.

=== Filing a translation bug ===

You should file a translation bug if you are experiencing one of the following issues:

* Wrong translations or spelling mistakes for languages other than English in applications
* Errors in spellcheckers or language support 
* A string from an application not available for translation in <nowiki>[[http://translations.launchpad.net/ubuntu|Launchpad Translations]]</nowiki>
* An application from the Ubuntu main repository not available for translation in <nowiki>[[http://translations.launchpad.net/ubuntu|Launchpad Translations]]</nowiki>
* A translation made in <nowiki>[[http://translations.launchpad.net/ubuntu|Launchpad Translations]]</nowiki> and not updated in the Ubuntu language packs
* A duplicate translation template (the same application can be translated in two different places) in <nowiki>[[http://translations.launchpad.net/ubuntu|Launchpad Translations]]</nowiki>
* A template/translation no longer used in Ubuntu and that should be disabled from <nowiki>[[http://translations.launchpad.net/ubuntu|Launchpad Translations]]</nowiki>
In case of doubt, you can always <nowiki>[[http://wiki.ubuntu.com/Translations/Contact|contact the Translations team]]</nowiki>.

All translation issues should be filed against the <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-translations | Ubuntu Translations project]]</nowiki>. From there the bugs will be triaged and assigned to the right person and package.
