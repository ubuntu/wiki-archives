== Ubuntu-MM IRC ==

Like many other Ubuntu teams, Ubuntu-MM uses <nowiki>[[InternetRelayChat|IRC]]</nowiki> as a form of communication. Most of the communication outside of the mailing list, as well as the fortnightly Ubuntu-MM meetings, take place in the Ubuntu-MM IRC channels:

* '''<nowiki>[[irc:--irc.freenode.net:6667-#ubuntu-mm|#ubuntu-mm]]</nowiki>''' (<nowiki>[[http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=ubuntu-mm|In your browser]]</nowiki>) is for questions about Ubuntu itself. If you need technical support, you should ask here.

You can connect to the Ubuntu-MM IRC channel using IRC clients such as Pidgin Internet Messenger (Formerly Gaim) or XChat, by pointing your client to '''irc.freenode.net:6667''' and joining the channels listed above.

Freenode prefers users to connect on the non-standard port of 6667 to prevent DCC problems that can disconnect users Routers from the Internet. Please use this port ''especially'' if you are unable to update your Router's firmware to the latest available.

=== Channel Guidelines ===

While in the Ubuntu-MM IRC channels (and in any Ubuntu channel) you are expected to abide by the <nowiki>[[http://ubuntu.com/community/conduct|Ubuntu Code of Conduct]]</nowiki> (CoC). Most of what is applicable to the IRC Channels can be summarised as follows (taken from <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/community/conduct|ubuntu.com]]</nowiki>):

 '''''Be respectful.''' The Ubuntu community and its members treat one another with respect. Everyone can make a valuable contribution to Ubuntu. We may not always agree, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behaviour and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It's important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. We expect members of the Ubuntu community to be respectful when dealing with other contributors as well as with people outside the Ubuntu project, and with users of Ubuntu.''

=== Meetings ===

The Ubuntu-MM team's were previously fortnightly meetings taking place in #ubuntu-mm. More details can be found on the <nowiki>[[MyanmarTeam-Meetings|Meetings Page]]</nowiki>. Anyone is welcome to drop in for the meetings, even if only to eavesdrop.

=== IRC Ops ===

IRC Ops are people in an IRC channel who have extra privileges and responsibilities. They are the people to call for any trouble in a channel. To get their attention, type '''!ops''' into the channel.

Currently, the Ubuntu-MM IRC Channel has the following Ops:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| kokoye2007
| <nowiki>[[kokoye2007]]</nowiki>
|-
| bonepyaesone
| 
| <nowiki>[[bonepyaesone]]</nowiki>
|}

If there are no ops around you can try <nowiki>[[http://freenode.net/faq.shtml#helpfromstaff|contacting a Freenode staffer]]</nowiki>.
