__TOC__

If the quorum isn't met for a live meeting, then the applicant has two options open to them. They may reschedule to a later meeting, or they may request that their application be handled via an email vote via the Ubuntu Membership Boards mailing list at ubuntu-membership-boards@lists.ubuntu.com.

At the time of writing the Membership Board consists of seven (7) delegates.

We are currently assessing what our requirements are for members present or voting by proxy to constitute a valid vote. lucyllewy has suggested a minimum of four voters either present in the meeting and via proxy during a meeting and a minimum of four voters casting their votes via email for email voting procedures.
