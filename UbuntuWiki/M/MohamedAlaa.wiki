=== Testimonials ===

- Mohammed is one of the most active members in our social media outlets as well as the support squad. He is a very active and hardworking member of the loco, not to mention he is our youngest member. We are definitely proud to have him in the loco.

- The first time I knew that Mohamed was only 13 years old I was really astonished, because of the high activity and good support he provided especially on our facebook support group. He is always engaged in conversations, learning, supporting others and actually started doing some development on his own. I am definitely proud to know him and would recommend him to be an Ubuntu member.

- Mohammed is highly active with Egypt LoCo through giving support and participating in online events and enthusiastically evangelizes the community. Though he is young, he looks to be a future developer and he showed a great ability to help others inside Ubuntu-EG community, whether through giving support, helping others to migrate and spreading the word. When it comes to the geeky stuff, he is like a sponge, always trying to learn more and get more involved. He currently maintains 2 great apps, <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/mosally|Mosally]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/indicator-prayer-times|Indicator-Prayer-Times]]</nowiki>. He'd be a great addition as Ubuntu Member. --<nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:ashams]]</nowiki>
