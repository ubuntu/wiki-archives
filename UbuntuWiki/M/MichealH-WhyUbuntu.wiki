Hello! I am Micheal Harker and on this page I will tell my experience with Ubuntu, why I like to get involved in the community. I will also tell you what the difference is between Ubuntu and Windows in my own view.

== So, Why Ubuntu? ==

=== Technology & Stability ===

I definitely feel that Ubuntu has an edge over every other Linux distribution. Yeah Fedora may have this brand new technology but it is unstable. Other Linux distributions lag behind technology and this may be because the Community may not be strong enough to sustain the constant updates that are happening and pushing them out to the end-user. Ubuntu falls in the middle of them and although some people may think that Ubuntu is unstable - they are wrong. Ubuntu balances between Fedora and the other distributions. It gets the right mix of stability v. technology.

=== Appearance ===

Ubuntu, Compared to other Distributions is alot better for the new User, not because of the Technology, but its appearance. Put yourself in the shoes of a new user, If you had the normal Interface of GNOME would '''you''' continue? I wouldn't , I say this because If I had a GUI like that I would think I was left with only Bare Essentials... Nothing else, this isn't true but I would get that feeling. Ubuntu goes beyond that and they provide a good GTK theme along with a good selection of apps.

=== Community ===

Ubuntu has one of the biggest and strongest communities Linux has, this can lead to having more updated software, more stable distributions and much more. Another good thing that I have seen is the community LoCo teams. I get involved in my Loco myself, attending all the meetings thrown at me. It also Is a chance to find your talent.
