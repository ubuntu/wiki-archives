== MythTV Hardware Support ==

Current testing is for Feisty, due for release in April 2007.  We would appreciate if you could download a daily live disk and test to see if your hardware is properly recognized and functional after installing the necessary drivers.  You won't have to erase your operating system, or do anything to harm your backend.  All testing will only be for the session that you are booted up.

=== TV Cards ===
These cards should all be supported by Ubuntu Feisty.  If you have one of these cards and can verify it working, please fill it out below.  Testing procedures for each of the cards are listed below as well.

=== Testing Procedure: IVTV Supported Cards ===
1. Download and burn a daily live disk.  Be sure this daily comes after December 26th, 2006.  Note: The Herd 1 Release doesn't include support
<pre>
http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-live/current/
</pre>

2. Boot up the live disk.  Make sure that your important hardware is working (mouse, keyboard, video, sound).  If you boot up to the Ubuntu Desktop and hear the login sound, your good to go.

3. Collect your dmesg output about the ivtv card from a console.
<pre>
dmesg | tac | sed -n '/=\ \ END INIT IVTV\ \ =/,/= START INIT IVTV =/p;/= START INIT IVTV =/q' | tac > ivtv.txt
</pre>

5. Attempt a test recording.  Run the following command for about 10-20 seconds and then press CTRL-C.
<pre>
cat /dev/video0 > test.mpg
</pre>

6. Test the playback of the video.  The installed media player, totem will be able to handle this for you, once the mpeg plugin is installed-- after launching the following command, you will be prompted to install the needed codec pack.  
<pre>
totem test.mpg
</pre>

6. Report your results back to this wiki page.  Please list the date of your test and your name and whether the card worked or not.  Also, attach your dmesg text output file above.   If your card didn't work, please file a bug in Launchpad using the following command in a terminal:

<pre>
ubuntu-bug -p linux
</pre> 

=== Testing Procedure: ATI HDTV Wonder ===
1. Download and burn a daily live disk.
<pre>
http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-live/current/
</pre>

2. Boot up the live disk.  Make sure that your important hardware is working (mouse, keyboard, video, sound).  If you boot up to the Ubuntu Desktop and hear the login sound, your good to go.

3. Unload any loaded modules for this card
<pre>
sudo rmmod cx88-dvb
</pre>

4. Obtain the firmware for the card and load the driver.  Directions to do this are at the MythTV wiki pages:
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MythTV_Edgy_hardware#head-83dbca2c20a36470fee58f582d0f9c274c1da43d

5. Install dvb-utils.  This will require you to enable multiverse/universe first.
<pre>
sudo apt-get install dvb-utils
</pre>

6. Test the scanning function using <code>scan</code>.  Scan requires some initial data to get going.  Localized initial data is provided in <code>/usr/share/doc/dvb-utils/examples</code>

7. Install mplayer and attempt to use the resultant channels.conf from your scan to tune a station.
<pre>
sudo apt-get install mplayer
mplayer dvb://0
</pre>

6. Report your results back to this wiki page.  Please list the date of your test and your name and whether the card worked or not.  Also, attach your dmesg text output file above.   If your card didn't work (but you used scan properly), please file a bug on launchpad using the following link.
