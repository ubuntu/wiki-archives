== Main Inclusion Report for m2300w ==

=== Requirements ===

# ''Availability:'' http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/m/m2300w, available for all supported architectures
# ''Rationale:''
** Provides support for the cheap color laser printers of Konica Minolta's magicolor "W" series. In contrary to the "DL" series Konica Minolta does not provide Linux drivers for these printers.
 0. ''Security:''
** No <nowiki>[[http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=m2300w|CVE entries]]</nowiki>.
** No <nowiki>[[http://secunia.com/search/?search=m2300w|Secunia history]]</nowiki>.
** No binaries running as root or suid/sgid.
** Does not open any port.
 0. ''Quality assurance:''
** Package works out of the box, requiring no configuration different to other printer drivers. Simply plug the printer, start the printer setup tool of your choice and choose the "m2300w" or "m2400w" driver (should be default, as this one is the recommended driver for the supported printers).
** Package does not ask any debconf questions.
** Active <nowiki>[[http://m2300w.sourceforge.net/|upstream]]</nowiki>. Additional user support via Openprinting (http://www.openprinting.org/, http://forums.freestandards.org/list.php?27).
** No critical bugs in <nowiki>[[http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=108751&atid=651367|upstream bug tracker]]</nowiki>
 0. ''Standards compliance:'' 
** Meets the <nowiki>[[http://www.pathname.com/fhs/|FHS]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[http://www.de.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/|Debian Policy]]</nowiki>, PPD files meet Adobe standard (test by running them through "cupstestppd" passes).
** Standard debhelper/cdbs/dbs packaging, standard patch system.
 0. ''Dependencies:''
** All in main.
