* Description: GPL media files to use with the GPL'd version of Quake.  This is effectively a project to make a fully GPL Quake distribution. Update: there's a standalone game available too.
* Notes: Not sure how far along this is; no updates since August 2004, but there's forum messages from the developers in March 2006 so they're still awake.
