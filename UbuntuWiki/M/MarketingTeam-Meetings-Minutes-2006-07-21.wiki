== Agenda ==

* SpreadUbuntu designs -- JendaVancura (jenda)
 (Choose which ideas we like and which we don't, discuss, decide who will work on the final design)

== Summary ==

'''1. SpreadUbuntu Designs'''

* Candidate designs:

*** https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MarketingTeam/SpreadUbuntu/GraphicalDesignSpec

* There was some discussion about how a preferred design should be selected however there was unanimous agreement on the preferred mockup at the meeting.  So here it is:

{{http://doc.ubuntu.com/~marketing/spreadubuntu/Design%20Mockups/Nestor%20Diaz/spread_ubuntu.png}}

* It was agreed the way forward is:

** Asking Nestor Diaz if he can further his idea as a real web design, not a raster mockup
** Asking the other designers to try and develop their own ideas based on that idea, again as web designs
** Making a general notice for outsiders to do the same
** Repeating this meeting on August 13, same time and finally deciding which design goes?

* Concerns regarding the mixed logo were raised.

'''2. Wiki Redesign'''

* A call to '''Please Help out!!'''

* nixternal has mockups of a new Marketing Team front page at:
** https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MarketingTeam/WikiMockup
