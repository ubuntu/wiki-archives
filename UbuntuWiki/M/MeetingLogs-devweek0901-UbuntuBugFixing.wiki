=== Dev Week -- Fixing Bugs in Ubuntu -- dholbach -- Wed, Jan 21 ===
UTC -4(EST)
<pre>
(12:00:12 PM) dholbach: so who's here for fixing Ubuntu bugs? who's excited? :-)))
(12:00:19 PM) rugby471: yeah!!
(12:00:31 PM) ***Flimm waves hand
(12:00:41 PM) duanedesign: \0/
(12:00:42 PM) dholbach: who else? :)
(12:00:50 PM) rugby471: You told me on Packaging 101 to come and listen here for the answer to my question, so here I am
(12:00:51 PM) Arc: sorry not at this point :-P
(12:00:55 PM) ***creek23 is.
(12:00:58 PM) dinxter: yep, partly excited because i've got a steak though too :)
(12:01:08 PM) mnemo: dholbach: do you know when pitti will run his gdb/crash session btw? the one that didnt happen yesterday?
(12:01:10 PM) ***charlie-tca waves
(12:01:27 PM) rugby471: :-)
(12:01:30 PM) ***porthose waves
(12:01:35 PM) dholbach: mnemo: it'll be announced broadly - no worries :)
(12:01:47 PM) dholbach: ok my friends - let's talk about fixing bugs
(12:02:17 PM) dholbach: it's really not difficult to be part of the revolution, to help out and make Ubuntu better
(12:02:28 PM) dholbach: especially with helpful people in #ubuntu-bugs and #ubuntu-motu
(12:02:45 PM) dholbach: again let me point you to https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MOTU/GettingStarted as it links to all the important stuff
(12:03:10 PM) dholbach: the important skill you need to have or develop is what I like to refer to as 'detective skills'
(12:03:24 PM) dholbach: it sometimes takes some searching on the web, some reading of docs, some talking to people
(12:04:01 PM) dholbach: and checking out what happened in the upstream revision control system, etc. to find a fix that's ready already or find a way to develop a simple fix
(12:04:24 PM) dholbach: because that's what it's all about: make Ubuntu better, be part of an awesome team :)
(12:04:42 PM) dholbach: OK, enough hand-waving - let's get to work and fix a few open bugs :)
(12:05:11 PM) dholbach: we have myriads of lists of open bugs, lists with CD building problems, lists of packages that don't build anymore and so on and so forth
(12:05:20 PM) dholbach: a bunch of them are linked from the MOTU/GettingStarted page
(12:05:42 PM) dholbach: I put some efforts into agreggating those lists in Harvest
(12:05:43 PM) dholbach: http://daniel.holba.ch/harvest
(12:06:06 PM) dholbach: it's a tool that pulls information about various 'opportunities' from various lists and displays them per package
(12:06:10 PM) duanedesign: dholbach: how do you" check out what happened in the upstream control system?"
(12:06:19 PM) DasEi left the room (quit: "Leaving.").
(12:06:22 PM) dholbach: duanedesign: we'll get to that in a bit in one of the examples
(12:06:36 PM) dholbach: duanedesign: can you ask the next questions in #ubuntu-classroom-chat prefixed with QUESTION: please? :)
(12:06:48 PM) KennethP_ is now known as KennethP
(12:06:51 PM) dholbach: I picked a few easy ones from harvest and hope we'll get through them in time
(12:07:00 PM) dholbach: let's start off with empathy
(12:07:01 PM) dholbach: http://daniel.holba.ch/harvest/handler.py?pkg=empathy
(12:08:03 PM) dholbach: it displays opportunities from various lists - not very nice, but it does its job - if you want to help out making harvest better, let me know - the code is in Launchpad
(12:08:12 PM) dholbach: let's click on the 291533 link
(12:08:28 PM) dholbach: it'll take us to one of the bugs that is on the "resolved-upstream" list
(12:08:35 PM) dholbach: which means: fixed upstream, broken in Ubuntu
(12:09:03 PM) dholbach: you can see the bug is about intrepid, version 2.24.1 all tabs having the same name
(12:09:15 PM) dholbach: now let's click on the "gnome-bugs #535042" link
(12:09:29 PM) dholbach: (if I'm too quick or anything is not clear, let me know in #ubuntu-classroom-chat please)
(12:09:41 PM) bluesmoke is now known as Amaranth
(12:10:10 PM) dholbach: so the upstream developer says on 2008-11-24 this is fixed already and that we should check if it really is
(12:10:35 PM) dholbach: intrepid will still have the same version, but let's check if we have a newer version in jaunty to play with
(12:10:55 PM) dholbach: click on the 'overview' link on the launchpad bug, it'll take you to https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/empathy
(12:11:20 PM) dholbach: jaunty has 2.25.4-1ubuntu1
(12:11:49 PM) dholbach: and if you check ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/empathy/2.25/ (where new GNOME releases end up at), you'll see that 2.25.4 was released at 06.01.2009
(12:11:56 PM) dholbach: which is way after 2008-11-24
(12:12:08 PM) dholbach: this means: the bug can theoretically be closed in Ubuntu
(12:12:15 PM) dholbach: what's important now?
(12:12:31 PM) dholbach:  _____ _____ ____ _____ ___ _   _  ____ _
(12:12:32 PM) dholbach: |_   _| ____/ ___|_   _|_ _| \ | |/ ___| |
(12:12:32 PM) dholbach:   | | |  _| \___ \ | |  | ||  \| | |  _| |
(12:12:32 PM) dholbach:   | | | |___ ___) || |  | || |\  | |_| |_|
(12:12:32 PM) dholbach:   |_| |_____|____/ |_| |___|_| \_|\____(_)
(12:12:32 PM) dholbach:                                           
(12:12:47 PM) dholbach: sorry for the bold letters and stuff, I thought I'd point it out clearly :)
(12:13:01 PM) dholbach: who here runs jaunty?
(12:13:20 PM) ***dholbach does
(12:13:25 PM) ***mnemo too
(12:13:32 PM) ***fta does too
(12:13:33 PM) ***charlie-tca too
(12:13:34 PM) ***seb128 does
(12:13:37 PM) ***creek23 uses Intrepid :(
(12:13:38 PM) dholbach: if nobody else does that's fine... here's how you can still SAFELY test jaunty:
(12:13:43 PM) dholbach: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopment/UsingDevelopmentReleases
(12:13:43 PM) dinxter: me too
(12:14:03 PM) dholbach: it will tell you how to make use of virtual machines, separate partitions or whatnot to safely run and test the development release
(12:14:15 PM) dholbach: so going back to our nice empathy bug
(12:14:30 PM) dholbach: we're <-> this close to closing it and having another bug fixed
(12:14:38 PM) seb128 left the room (quit: "Ex-Chat").
(12:14:39 PM) dholbach: we just need to test it :)
(12:15:01 PM) dholbach: this was a very cheesy example, but you see what it took to get to the point of "ah, this should be fixed already"
(12:15:08 PM) dholbach: just a bit of digging and checking some other sites
(12:15:14 PM) dholbach: and that's what it's all about :)
(12:15:23 PM) dholbach: <creek23> QUESTION: Will VirtualBox run Jaunty on WUBI? o.O
(12:15:27 PM) seb128 [n=seb128@ANancy-158-1-98-214.w90-40.abo.wanadoo.fr] entered the room.
(12:15:46 PM) dholbach: creek23: I'm sorry, I'm the wrong person to ask that, I did not use WUBI yet - you could try it :)
(12:16:02 PM) dholbach: alright... let's move on to the next example ;-)
(12:16:17 PM) dholbach: http://daniel.holba.ch/harvest/handler.py?pkg=gtksourceview
(12:16:39 PM) dholbach: gtksourceview is the piece of code that does syntax highlighting in places like gedit and stuff
(12:16:48 PM) dholbach: let's click on the 242920 link
(12:16:58 PM) dholbach: another one on the list of resolved-upstream bugs
(12:17:04 PM) dholbach: <benste> Question: Don't you close the bug now?
(12:17:15 PM) dholbach: benste: did you test if it was really fixed? :)
(12:17:29 PM) dholbach: closing on hearsay does not count :)
(12:17:35 PM) benste: thought someone else did it here :-)
(12:17:37 PM) dholbach:  _____ _____ ____ _____ ___ _   _  ____ _
(12:17:37 PM) dholbach: |_   _| ____/ ___|_   _|_ _| \ | |/ ___| |
(12:17:37 PM) dholbach:   | | |  _| \___ \ | |  | ||  \| | |  _| |
(12:17:37 PM) dholbach:   | | | |___ ___) || |  | || |\  | |_| |_|
(12:17:37 PM) dholbach:   |_| |_____|____/ |_| |___|_| \_|\____(_)
(12:17:38 PM) dholbach:                                           
(12:17:40 PM) dholbach: :-)
(12:17:51 PM) dholbach: <duanedesign> QUESTION: how do you "close" a bug?
(12:18:13 PM) dholbach: duanedesign: you click on the dropdown thingie next to "empathy" on the launchpad page (in the yellow bar)
(12:18:24 PM) dholbach: it'll open a menu where you can change the status to "fix released"
(12:18:50 PM) dholbach: alright, let's crack on with the gtksourceview bug
(12:19:07 PM) dholbach: again it's supposed to be fixed upstream, so let's take a look at the upstream bug
(12:19:15 PM) dholbach: "gnome-bugs #139968"
(12:19:24 PM) dholbach: http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=139968
(12:19:40 PM) dholbach: <benste> question: fix released on LP only care about the latest development version and eg not about a LTS version?
(12:19:42 PM) dholbach: benste: yes
(12:19:49 PM) benste: :-(
(12:19:52 PM) dholbach: benste: else you need to open a bug task for the old version
(12:20:10 PM) dholbach: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates is the policy for SRUs (stable release updates)
(12:20:20 PM) dholbach: which is only for very important stuff
(12:21:18 PM) dholbach: OK, seems like a new file was added to allow ASP stuff with gtksourceview (comment 18)
(12:21:24 PM) dholbach: let's see what we need to do
(12:22:08 PM) dholbach: so it was talking about it not working in gedit, let's check in jaunty
(12:22:20 PM) dholbach: this is what I get in Jaunty
(12:22:22 PM) dholbach: daniel@bert:~$ apt-cache showsrc gedit | grep Depends

(12:22:23 PM) dholbach: daniel@bert:~$
(12:22:30 PM) dholbach: erm, sorry
(12:22:46 PM) dholbach: this is what I meant to do:
(12:22:47 PM) dholbach: daniel@bert:~$ apt-cache show gedit | grep ^Depends
(12:22:47 PM) dholbach: Depends: gconf2 (>= 2.10.1-2), python, python-support (>= 0.7.1), libatk1.0-0 (>= 1.20.0), libattr1 (>= 2.4.41-1), libc6 (>= 2.4), libcairo2 (>= 1.2.4), libenchant1c2a (>= 1.4.2), libgconf2-4 (>= 2.13.5), libglib2.0-0 (>= 2.18.0), libgtk2.0-0 (>= 2.14.0), libgtksourceview2.0-0 (>= 2.3), libice6 (>= 1:1.0.0), liblaunchpad-integration1 (>= 0.1.17), libpango1.0-0 (>= 1.22.0), libsm6, libx11-6, libxml2 (>= 2.6.27), python2.5 (>= 2.5), scro

(12:23:02 PM) dholbach: you can see that gedit links against libgtksourceview2.0-0
(12:23:26 PM) dholbach: and this shows us which package we need to look at:
(12:23:26 PM) dholbach: daniel@bert:~$ apt-cache showsrc libgtksourceview2.0-0 | head -n2
(12:23:26 PM) dholbach: Package: gtksourceview2

(12:23:26 PM) dholbach: daniel@bert:~$
(12:23:54 PM) dholbach: (just as a side-note: the bug was filed against gtksourceview, but it's actually gtksourceview2 we need to look at!)
(12:24:29 PM) dholbach: if you're on jaunty, please run
(12:24:37 PM) dholbach:   apt-get source gtksourceview2
(12:24:40 PM) dholbach: if not, please run
(12:24:52 PM) dholbach:    sudo apt-get install devscripts; dget -x https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/jaunty/+source/gtksourceview2/2.5.3-0ubuntu1/+files/gtksourceview2_2.5.3-0ubuntu1.dsc
(12:25:17 PM) dholbach: with these commands we download the gtksourceview2 package and see if it was fixed already
(12:25:43 PM) dholbach: once that's done, please
(12:25:44 PM) dholbach:   cd gtksourceview2-2.5.3
(12:25:52 PM) dholbach:   find . -name '*asp*'
(12:26:01 PM) dholbach: on my machine it spits out   ./gtksourceview/language-specs/asp.lang
(12:26:17 PM) dholbach: so it seems an ASP language definition was added
(12:26:20 PM) dholbach: Woohoo!
(12:26:27 PM) dholbach: what do we need to do now? :)
(12:26:41 PM) dholbach: right
(12:26:43 PM) dholbach:  _____ _____ ____ _____ ___ _   _  ____ _
(12:26:44 PM) dholbach: |_   _| ____/ ___|_   _|_ _| \ | |/ ___| |
(12:26:44 PM) dholbach:   | | |  _| \___ \ | |  | ||  \| | |  _| |

(12:26:44 PM) dholbach:                                           
(12:26:48 PM) dholbach: and we can close the bug :)
(12:28:01 PM) dholbach: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopment/UsingDevelopmentReleases if you don't want to run jaunty on real hardware
(12:28:23 PM) dholbach: that was another cheesy example, this time we checked the upstream bug tracker and we downloaded the source package to verify in the code
(12:28:28 PM) dholbach: everybody having fun so far? :)
(12:28:40 PM) duanedesign: :)
(12:28:43 PM) dholbach: open questions?
(12:29:31 PM) dholbach: guess not, so let's crack on
(12:29:44 PM) dholbach: please run this now:
(12:29:46 PM) dholbach:   sudo apt-get install subversion cdbs devscripts gnome-pkg-tools
(12:29:52 PM) dholbach: we're going to need the tools mentioned there
(12:30:09 PM) dholbach: <Ape3000> QUESTION: Do you recommend installing on virtualbox?
(12:30:23 PM) dholbach: Ape3000: whatever works for you, if it's KVM or virtualbox doesn't matter :)
(12:30:28 PM) dholbach: they both work great for me
(12:30:52 PM) dholbach: alright, let's take a look at http://daniel.holba.ch/harvest/handler.py?pkg=gnome-utils
(12:31:01 PM) dholbach: and let's click on the 301952 link
(12:31:08 PM) KennethP_ is now known as KennethP
(12:31:17 PM) dholbach: it's another bug that was resolved upstream
(12:31:25 PM) dholbach: this time we'll get the patch for it and see what we need to do
(12:31:50 PM) dholbach: <duanedesign> Question: how about closing a bug that turns out was a config problem that the submitter solves in the process of the triage?
(12:32:06 PM) dholbach: duanedesign: fine to close it, if you give a nice response explaining where the user went wrong
(12:32:43 PM) dholbach: OK, "gnome-bugs #567834" seems to be the upstream bug that fixed the issue
(12:32:47 PM) dholbach: let's see what the upstream guys say
(12:33:16 PM) dholbach: Fabio says it was fixed in the development version, let's check in SVN
(12:33:31 PM) dholbach: http://svn.gnome.org/viewvc/gnome-utils/trunk/ is where you can see what's going on in upstream's subversion repository
(12:33:43 PM) dholbach: the first check can always be the ChangeLog file
(12:33:56 PM) dholbach: so http://svn.gnome.org/viewvc/gnome-utils/trunk/ChangeLog?revision=8374&view=markup
(12:34:20 PM) dholbach: unfortunately it just says that the last release was pushed out on 2009-01-09
(12:34:21 PM) dholbach: hmm
(12:34:44 PM) dholbach: so let's take a look at http://svn.gnome.org/viewvc/gnome-utils/trunk/baobab/
(12:34:53 PM) dholbach: we'll find it has a separate ChangeLog
(12:34:58 PM) dholbach: http://svn.gnome.org/viewvc/gnome-utils/trunk/baobab/ChangeLog?revision=8378&view=markup
(12:35:21 PM) dholbach: The last entry was on 2009-01-15, from Fabio
(12:35:28 PM) dholbach: saying that he fixed the issue we are talking about
(12:35:45 PM) dholbach: that means we can't just grab a new release and upgrade the package to it
(12:35:56 PM) dholbach: we need to grab the patch
(12:36:15 PM) dholbach: if you want to use svn to do it (you can do it through the Web UI too), run this
(12:36:24 PM) dholbach: svn checkout http://svn.gnome.org/svn/gnome-utils/trunk
(12:36:33 PM) dholbach: it will download the trunk of gnome-utils
(12:37:16 PM) dholbach: in the Web UI you can also see that the commit that fixed it was r8378
(12:37:22 PM) dholbach: so:
(12:37:25 PM) dholbach:   cd trunk
(12:37:33 PM) dholbach:   svn diff -r 8377:8378
(12:38:02 PM) dholbach: it shows the changelog entry and a small fix in baobab/src/baobab.c
(12:38:24 PM) dholbach: we're just interested in the fix, we'll document the fix ourselves, so:
(12:38:28 PM) dholbach:   svn diff -r 8377:8378 baobab/src/ > ~/patch
(12:38:46 PM) dholbach: now we have the patch file in ~/patch
(12:38:47 PM) dholbach: awesome
(12:38:57 PM) dholbach: <charlie-tca> QUESTION: Is there something that tells where SVN is for various projects?
(12:39:19 PM) dholbach: charlie-tca: google is always a good place to check, or the upstream homepage, some packages have it documented in the source package itself
(12:39:33 PM) dholbach: if you have a set of packages you're interested you find out very quickly where to check
(12:39:45 PM) dholbach: unfortunately there's no "big shopping list of upstream revision control systems" yet
(12:40:08 PM) dholbach: but we're working on importing lots of upstream RCS data into Launchpad, so we can use just launchpad and bzr everywhere
(12:40:18 PM) dholbach: which is going to be a glorious, golden and sunshiny day
(12:40:33 PM) dholbach: alright
(12:40:53 PM) dholbach: to get the newest source package of gnome-utils in jaunty (so we can patch it), please run
(12:40:55 PM) dholbach: in jaunty:
(12:40:59 PM) dholbach:   apt-get source gnome-utils
(12:41:02 PM) dholbach: else, please run
(12:41:08 PM) dholbach:   dget -x https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/jaunty/+source/gnome-utils/2.25.2-0ubuntu1/+files/gnome-utils_2.25.2-0ubuntu1.dsc
(12:41:56 PM) dholbach: the package gnome-utils (as almost all GNOME source packages) makes use of a tool called CDBS (and CDBS patch system) to make the packaging a bit easier
(12:42:06 PM) dholbach: <rugby471> Question: what is dget?
(12:42:29 PM) dholbach: rugby471: yes, it uses wget (or curl) to download not only the .dsc file, but also the .diff.gz and .orig.tar.gz which in summary make up the source package
(12:42:54 PM) dholbach: now please:
(12:42:56 PM) dholbach:   cd gnome-utils-2.25.2
(12:43:24 PM) dholbach: maxb just tells me:
(12:43:27 PM) dholbach: <maxb> dholbach: Rather than dget, maybe mention pull-lp-source from ubuntu-dev-tools? e.g. $ pull-lp-source gnome-utils jaunty
(12:43:40 PM) dholbach: there you go: just learned something new (just install ubuntu-dev-tools too)
(12:44:57 PM) dholbach: rugby471 just tells me he had trouble, because the tarball was not extracted, if that happened to you, please run
(12:45:09 PM) dholbach:   dpkg-source -x gnome-utils*dsc
(12:45:21 PM) rugby471: cool that works now
(12:45:22 PM) dholbach: sorry folks, no idea what happened there, but let's crack on :)
(12:45:24 PM) rugby471: thx
(12:45:37 PM) dholbach: now we'll use a cool feature of CDBS
(12:45:39 PM) dholbach: please run
(12:45:40 PM) dholbach:    cdbs-edit-patch 20_fix_fat32_scan_crash
(12:45:45 PM) dholbach: what it does is:
(12:46:00 PM) dholbach:  - open a "sub shell" where you can edit the source and do all you need to make it work again
(12:46:24 PM) dholbach:  - when you type exit (or just Ctrl-D) it will close the subshell and create debian/patches/20_fix_fat32_scan_crash.patch for us
(12:46:37 PM) dholbach:  - which is the patch of the changes we did
(12:46:39 PM) dholbach: which is awesome
(12:46:44 PM) dholbach: in this subshell, please run
(12:46:51 PM) dholbach:   patch -p0 < ~/patch
(12:46:59 PM) dholbach: (which will use the patch we extracted from SVN)
(12:47:27 PM) dholbach: then, please type
(12:47:28 PM) dholbach:   exit
(12:47:31 PM) dholbach: or hit Ctrl-D
(12:48:11 PM) dholbach: this means we have succeeded and added the patch to the source package - fantastico
(12:48:18 PM) dholbach: I said we're going to document it, so please run
(12:48:19 PM) dholbach:   dch -i
(12:48:20 PM) dholbach: now
(12:48:33 PM) dholbach: which will add a boilerplate changelog entry for you
(12:49:23 PM) dholbach: now what we put in there should be quite verbose
(12:49:30 PM) dholbach: we want to document well what we did and why we did it
(12:49:37 PM) dholbach: I'll put in there something like this:
(12:51:03 PM) dholbach:   * debian/patches/20_fix_fat32_scan_crash.patch: fix segmentation fault when trying to performe "scan folder" on a fat32 partition. Taken from Upstream SVN r8378 (LP: #301952)
(12:51:11 PM) dholbach: of course add some line wrapping to it
(12:51:21 PM) dholbach: let's take a look at it step by step
(12:51:43 PM) dholbach:  - I reference the file I added, so it's easier to spot which files exactly I changed
(12:51:54 PM) dholbach:  - I mentioned what the bug was all about and that it's fixed now
(12:52:12 PM) dholbach:  - I mentioned where I have the patch from (add extra authority by saying that it comes from upstream)
(12:52:41 PM) dholbach:  - I mention the SVN revision, so the uploader who works on gnome-utils the next time will now: with the next upstream release I can drop the patch again
(12:52:59 PM) dholbach:  - and I refer to the Launchpad bug in a special notation: this way the bug will get automatically fixed on upload
(12:53:08 PM) dholbach: <Ape3000> QUESTION: Shouldn't I use my pgp key with the dch?
(12:53:28 PM) dholbach: Ape3000: if you mean the email address you have on your GPG key, yes
(12:53:34 PM) dholbach: <mnemo> QUESTION: does the debian build process automatically apply debian/patches/* to the orig before compiling?
(12:53:45 PM) dholbach: mnemo: yes, that's what simple-patchsys.mk in debian/rules does
(12:53:52 PM) dholbach: <porthose> QUESTION: Would you also push this patch to debian?
(12:54:05 PM) dholbach: porthose: I'm going to say a bit more about what we're going to do with it in a sec
(12:54:51 PM) dholbach: now let's save the file and please run
(12:54:54 PM) dholbach:    debuild -S -us -uc
(12:55:02 PM) dholbach: to rebuild the source package with the new entry
(12:55:11 PM) dholbach: if all goes well a
(12:55:12 PM) dholbach:    ls ..
(12:55:25 PM) dholbach: should show you gnome-utils_2.25.2-0ubuntu2.dsc amongst others
(12:55:41 PM) Philipp_ is now known as HEP85
(12:55:50 PM) dholbach: now please run
(12:55:52 PM) dholbach:   cd ..
(12:56:11 PM) dholbach:   debdiff gnome-utils_2.25.2-0ubuntu1.dsc gnome-utils_2.25.2-0ubuntu2.dsc
(12:56:25 PM) dholbach: and post the output to a pastebin and post the link in this channel
(12:56:41 PM) dholbach: <WalterMundt> QUESTION: is there a good reference for all of the options of debuild?  I notice some mentioned in HOWTO's that aren't in the manpage directly, so either I'm missing them or there's something a bit more complex going on.
(12:56:59 PM) dholbach: WalterMundt: check https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PackagingGuide and   man dpkg-buildpackage   and    man debuild
(12:57:15 PM) dholbach: ok, a few words until you posted your results somewhere:
(12:57:32 PM) rugby471: http://pastebin.com/m7b422082
(12:57:35 PM) dholbach:  - in the specific case of gnome-utils you would probably just wait for the next release (which is regular and in just a few days)
(12:57:45 PM) dholbach:  - in all other cases, you would
(12:57:50 PM) Ape3000: http://paste.ubuntu.com/107870/
(12:57:51 PM) dinxter: http://paste.ubuntu.com/107868/
(12:57:57 PM) dholbach:    + attach the resulting patch to the bug report
(12:58:14 PM) dholbach:     + and subscribe ubuntu-main-sponsors, who will review the patch and upload it for you because they like it
(12:58:31 PM) Quintasan: http://wklej.org/id/42593/
(12:58:41 PM) dholbach: dinxter: I'd wrap the text at 80 chars per line, other than that: good work
(12:59:01 PM) dholbach: Ape3000: same as for dinxter :)
(12:59:29 PM) Ape3000: You mean I should wrap the ChangeLog line?
(12:59:29 PM) dholbach: rugby471: good work, I'd add a reference to where the patch comes from and which LP bug it fixes
(12:59:34 PM) dholbach: Ape3000: yep
(12:59:49 PM) dholbach: Quintasan: good work, same as Ape3000
(12:59:52 PM) dholbach: wow... any more patches?
(01:00:15 PM) dholbach: and don't forget one thing:
(01:00:16 PM) dholbach:  _____ _____ ____ _____ ___ _   _  ____ _
(01:00:16 PM) dholbach: |_   _| ____/ ___|_   _|_ _| \ | |/ ___| |
