MOTU Meeting Minutes for 2008-07-25

=== MOTU Leadership Teams - Membership Policy Discussion Cnt'd. ===

From the last meeting (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MOTU/Meetings/2008-07-11), CodySomerville and StefanPotyra collaborated to bring forth a summary as promised of the MOTU Leadership Teams Membership Policy Discussion which can be found at https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-motu/2008-July/004227.html

At this meeting, StefanPotyra agreed to chair, CodySomerville agreed to write the minutes, and EmmetHikory agreed to write a proposal to -MOTU. Vibrant discussion continued regarding the MOTU Leadership Teams Membership Policy. In contrast to previous discussions, a growing preference for, rationalized by a desire and proposed higher need for working teams rather than bureaucratic accuracy, a system that avoids voting was evident. Others, however, felt that such a system would be ill-defined, inherently more complex, and questionable as voting is used to measure the legitimacy of the leadership teams. 

The proposal wrote by EmmetHikory can be found at https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-motu/2008-July/004278.html
