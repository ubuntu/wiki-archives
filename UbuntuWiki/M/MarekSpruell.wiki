Hello, my name is Marek Spruell. I have been using linux for about 7
years, the last 4 of which it has been my primary OS.  I am in #ubuntu most every day, helping with
general "newbie" to "advanced beginner" level questions (freeing up
smarter folks to answer the harder questions). I am a local advocate for free software (Ubuntu) in my community(I hand out ubuntu cds quite often, and follow up)
