[19:00] <hallyn> #startmeeting
[19:00] <Daviey> ttx: I thought the deal was scribe + chair?
[19:00] <hallyn> hm, didn't work
[19:00] <ttx> yes, it's scribe+chair, the same meeting
[19:00]  * SpamapS hugs hallyn :)
[19:00] <ttx> MootBot is not around
[19:00] <hallyn> how do we start it?
[19:01] <Daviey> hallyn: We'll have to do without :(
[19:01] <ttx> hallyn: you don't, you do without !
[19:01] <hallyn> uh, ok
[19:01] <ttx> first time driving, and no brakes
[19:01] <hallyn> i'll just pretend it's there
[19:01] <ttx> I'm sure daviey can emulate the bot
[19:01] <hallyn> [TOPIC] Review ACTION points from previous meeting
[19:01] <Daviey> Meeting started at 07:59. The chair is hallyn :)
[19:01] <hallyn> ttx to coordinate testing for Alpha 2
[19:02] <ttx> added as an agenda item, will be covered during this meeting
[19:02] <ttx> so consider it DONE
[19:02] <hallyn> cool
[19:02] <hallyn> smoser to chase IS regarding cjwatson's access and improving
[19:02] <ttx> <smoser> DONE
[19:02] <hallyn> cooler
[19:02] <ttx> (I'll proxy smoser
[19:02] <ttx> )
[19:02] <hallyn> jjohansen to ask kamal to email ubuntu-server mailing list with results of atop patchset
[19:03] <hallyn> so the email, so i assume that's done
[19:03] <ttx> ah?
[19:03] <hallyn> oh no
[19:03] <jjohansen> right, he did basic testing and handed it back to me
[19:03] <hallyn> so status?
[19:03] <jjohansen> I emailed jos, and ttx, and sent an email to k-t for discussion
[19:03] <ttx> jjohansen: so it's still todo, but on your side ?
[19:03] <jjohansen> yes, the discussion is really been stalled by alpha2
[19:04] <ttx> jjohansen: ack
=== bjf[afk] is now known as bjf
[19:04] <hallyn> so action for next week, or wait until alpha3 to do that?
[19:04] <jjohansen> I will send a mail today
[19:04] <jjohansen> Basically server team needs to decide if atop is worth it
[19:04] <hallyn> [ACTION] jjohansen to send email regarding atop patchset
[19:05] <hallyn> ok, thanks, moving on
[19:05] <hallyn> jjohansen, tim or andy to email ccheney and Daviey with test kernels for bug #588861
[19:05] <ubottu> Launchpad bug 588861 in linux (Ubuntu Maverick) ""pad block corrupted" error when trying to register an image with 2.6.34 kernel" [High,Fix committed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/588861
[19:05] <hallyn> that was fully bisected right?
[19:05] <ttx> this was DONE and fixed.
[19:05] <Daviey> Yup.. the kernel team and ccheney rock!
[19:05] <jjohansen> yeah, tim rocks
[19:06] <hallyn> rockin'
[19:06] <hallyn> People to subscribe to the test coverage for http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/qatracker/build/ubuntuserver/all
[19:06] <hallyn> ttx: do you know if everyone is subscribed?  :)
[19:06] <ttx> not really DONE, so I decided to split the work myself, see below
[19:06] <ttx> (makes more sense anywayÃ 
[19:06] <ttx> )
[19:07] <hallyn> ok i see it thx
[19:07] <hallyn> hggdh to email interested parties about the results of the ppa euca build
[19:07] <hggdh> tests still being run on latest & greatest version of the patch. So far, so good
[19:08] <Daviey> \o/
[19:08] <hallyn> so carry over?
[19:08] <ttx> hallyn: no
[19:08] <hggdh> I hope I will have a position in about 30 min
[19:08] <hggdh> right now, ~400 instances, no issue
[19:08] <Daviey> Keep in mind that upstream just confirmed that they aren't *entirely confident* it fixed it.. but think it has
[19:09] <hggdh> considering we started with failures in less than 100 instances, this is a big improvement
[19:09] <hallyn> so... the tests are still running...  any action to track?
[19:09] <ttx> hallyn: no
[19:09] <hallyn> k
[19:09] <hallyn> jjohansen to follow up on bug #TBC - EC2 kernel (lucid/maverick kernel ?)
[19:09] <Daviey> ^^ a bug was opened about that.
[19:09] <ttx> Daviey: LP:#?
[19:10] <jjohansen> give me a sec, to find it again
[19:10] <Daviey> it was at the end of the last meeting.. /me glares at the scribe :)
[19:10] <jjohansen> Bug #597387
[19:10] <ubottu> Launchpad bug 597387 in Ubuntu "pv-ops kernel only works in 3 or 4 zones in EC2" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/597387
[19:11] <jjohansen> I have a new kernel I am building and will be testing in just a little but
[19:11] <jjohansen> s/but/bit/
[19:11] <ttx> jjohansen: ok, we'll discuss that later in the meeting
[19:11] <hallyn> ok thanks.  moving on
[19:11] <hallyn> zul to mail the ubuntu-server mailing list with the SRU nomination process, and document his process from there
[19:12] <zul> done
[19:12]  * hallyn craftily evades Daviey's glare
[19:12] <hallyn> ok, thanks
[19:12] <hallyn> [TOPIC] Maverick development (ttx)
[19:12] <ttx> Alpha2 subcycle status
[19:12] <ttx> http://people.canonical.com/~pitti/workitems/maverick/canonical-server-maverick-alpha-2.html
[19:12] <ttx> Specs should be at 90-100% now
[19:12] <ttx> Only two days left
[19:13] <ttx> Please see the remaining work items and let me know if you can't make it
[19:13] <ttx> Alpha2-milestoned bugs
[19:13] <hallyn> so all must be done by EOD thursday?  or start of day?
[19:13] <ttx> the sooner the better -- there are a few documentation items that can be completed eod
[19:13] <ttx> (or bug triage)
[19:14] <ttx> Bug 588410: dynamic block storage should use virtio
[19:14] <ubottu> Launchpad bug 588410 in eucalyptus (Ubuntu Maverick) "dynamic block storage should use virtio" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/588410
[19:14] <ttx> Bug 595421: Eucalyptus doesn't start with latest stable version of "Groovy"
[19:14] <ubottu> Launchpad bug 595421 in eucalyptus (Ubuntu Maverick) "Eucalyptus doesn't start with latest stable version of "Groovy"" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/595421
[19:14] <Daviey> It was fixed in bzr ages ago, pending a 1.7 upload.  However, that has been blocked by some known issues.  Therefore i'm doing an unwanted of upload of 1.6.2 with the 2 fixes for Bug 588410 and Bug 595421 before EoD.
[19:14] <SpamapS> ttx: I have a lot of MIR's that are still under consideration/undone .. do those have to be accepted into main by thursday?
[19:14] <ttx> Daviey:  good !
[19:15] <ttx> SpamapS: it's part of the feature delivery, so yes... but that's hardly your fault if you pushed them as much as you could
[19:15] <ttx> SpamapS: if we have to postpone such items, I can bring it to the release meeting to point out a resource shortage
[19:16] <ttx> (but it's a well known one)
[19:16] <ttx> Bug 574554: tgtd needs init script or upstart job
[19:16] <ubottu> Launchpad bug 574554 in tgt (Ubuntu Maverick) "tgtd needs init script or upstart job" [Medium,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/574554
[19:16] <ttx> same situation here
[19:16] <SpamapS> ttx: I'll poke them all today then.
[19:16] <ttx> though I wonder why this one was targeted to alpha-2
[19:16] <hggdh> if I may interrupt -- test run completed, 400 instances, no occurrence of the metadata issue. Of course, we are talking about a race, but I vote we consider it a success
[19:16] <ttx> Daviey: any clue ?
[19:17] <Daviey> \o/
[19:17] <hallyn> w00t
[19:17] <ttx> Daviey: you need tgtd for something in UEC ?
[19:17] <Daviey> ttx: nothing to do with me :/
[19:17] <ttx> ... ok
[19:17] <zul> i have to update the tgtd upstart script
[19:17] <ttx> will ask kirkland when I get a chance
[19:18] <ttx> Alpha3 subcycle starts Friday
[19:18] <Daviey> Hmm.. iSCSI is on our roadmap.. but i wasn't aware tgtd was a target for A2
[19:18] <ttx> http://people.canonical.com/~pitti/workitems/maverick/canonical-server-maverick-alpha-3.html
[19:18] <ttx> Please have a look at your specs and make sure the work items for Alpha-3 are current
[19:18] <ttx> I already had a look and most of them are ok, except mathiaz's ones
[19:19] <SpamapS> ttx: bug#586638  .. do I need to do something to complete the MIR? Kees gave it a +1
[19:19] <ttx> [ACTION] mathiaz to provide work items for Alpha3 on his specs by Thursday
[19:19] <SpamapS> bug 586638
[19:19] <ubottu> Launchpad bug 586638 in libmemcached (Ubuntu) "[MIR] libmemcached" [Undecided,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/586638
[19:19] <Daviey> ttx: Hmm.. I wasn't aware server-maverick-uec-monitoring was re-assigned to me :/
[19:19] <ttx> SpamapS: ask him if it's good to seed or if it was just a security ack
[19:20] <ttx> SpamapS: zul can handle the seeding for you if that's all what is needed
[19:20] <zul> ack
[19:20] <ttx> Daviey: sync with kirkland on that one
[19:21] <Daviey> ttx: will do
[19:21] <ttx> hallyn: done
[19:21] <hallyn> [TOPIC] ISO testing coverage (ttx)
[19:21] <hallyn> uh,
[19:21] <hallyn> [TOPIC] Alpha2 ISO testing coverage (ttx)
[19:21] <ttx> ok, so alpha2 milestone candidates should hit us RSN
[19:21] <hallyn> and we just start getting emails?
[19:22] <ttx> I split the team in subteams to make sure we do a complete coverage of server deliveries
[19:22] <ttx> hallyn: yes, we should
[19:22] <ttx> (if you're assigned to at least one test)
[19:22] <ttx> smoser will cover the EC2 images
[19:22] <hallyn> (which i am) cool, thx
[19:22] <ttx> kirkland/Daviey/ccheney: Maverick UEC topologies, UEC Maverick images (on Lucid UEC), Netboot tests
[19:22] <ttx> hallyn/mathiaz/SpamapS/zul: non-UEC Ubuntu Server tests, Upgrade server
[19:22] <ttx> ttx/hggdh: random testing, cover holes in testing, replace missing people
[19:23] <zul> yay!
[19:23] <Daviey> zul: If you get bored, i'm sure we can find some UEC tests for you! :)
[19:23] <ttx> the last team needs to get a picture of the general QA level, so it's more free-form
[19:23] <ttx> that said, we know that hggdh will concentarte on UEC
[19:23] <ttx> for the time being
[19:23]  * hggdh sighs ;-)
[19:24] <ttx> and I'll replace mathiaz
[19:24] <ttx> for A2
[19:24] <ttx> Just coordinate with members of your subteam to avoid duplicate testing
[19:24] <Daviey> poor mathiaz
[19:24] <ttx> (deuplicate testing is good, but once we are at 100% coverage)
[19:24] <kirkland> ttx: zul: re: tftd upstart script, not required for A2, I targeted it there as I thought zul/ccheney might be able to accomplish it within their given resources for A2; postponing to A3 is fine by me
[19:24] <ttx> kirkland: ok, thanks
[19:25] <hallyn> moving on?
[19:25] <ttx> If any of this coordination is unclear, let me know
[19:25] <ttx> also ISO testing is open to everyone... this is just to ensure that all tests are covered by at least one person :)
[19:25] <ttx> hallyn: yes
[19:26] <hallyn> thanks
[19:26] <hallyn> [TOPIC] Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (hggdh)
[19:26] <zul> if a tree falls in a forest...
[19:26] <hggdh> I spent the last week on a sprint in Lexington; most work done, some left-overs to look at
[19:27] <hallyn> anyone have any questions?
[19:27] <hggdh> during this time I kept on testing the metadata fix(es)
[19:28] <hallyn> (going once, going twice)
[19:28] <hallyn> thanks hggdh
[19:28] <hallyn> [TOPIC] Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (jjohansen)

[19:28] <hallyn> lol, we just wanted to see the 'fix committed' :)
[19:28] <jjohansen> :)
[19:28] <hallyn> atop kernel patch
[19:29] <hallyn> we're just waiting for the email to discuss there?
[19:29] <ttx> yes
[19:29] <jjohansen> its been built and tested email to server team list for discussion being composed
[19:29] <ttx> see if there is a real interest in this
[19:29] <hallyn> any other questions for or from jjohansen ?
[19:29] <ttx> Maverick EC2 kernel issue
[19:30] <ttx> so at this point we'll have Lucidish kernels in A2
[19:30] <jjohansen> right
[19:30] <ttx> (for cloud images)
[19:30] <ttx> The idea would be to fix that for A3 ?
[19:30] <zul> heh
[19:30] <ttx> or another plan ?
[19:30] <jjohansen> yes we will have a kernel for A3
[19:30] <jjohansen> it is likely to be the full xen kernel,
[19:31] <ttx> ok, I'll mark that bug appropriately
[19:31] <ttx> fianlly wanted to raise to your attention:
[19:31] <ttx> Bug 576066: ums-cypress.ko missing from server installer

[19:31] <ttx> Sounds like a good thing to fix for 10.04.1
[19:32] <ttx> jjohansen: can you prioritize it appropriately ?
[19:32] <jjohansen> yes
[19:32] <ttx> ok, I'm done :)

[19:33] <sommer> if anyone else does though feel free
[19:33] <ttx> sommer: did you fix the refresh issue ?
[19:33] <hallyn> i have a feeling i should have a question at some point oabout lxc, but need to read up on processes first...
[19:33] <sommer> Daviey: :-)
[19:34] <sommer> ttx: I'll ping mdke again, through email this time
