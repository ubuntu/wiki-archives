I've acquired a secondhand server that I hope to test in an LTSP-like setup for our older lab.  Unfortunately, this Supermicro box has a Serverworks chipset, and that means it's not playing so nicely with Ubuntu.  Nor Debian (Sarge) unless I install the 2.4 kernel.  I'm trying to keep notes on getting it working with Breezy on the perhaps misnamed ServerworksMotherboard page.
