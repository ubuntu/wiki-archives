** Miscellaneous and Questions
 <pre>
12:01 < jdstrand> based on what was said in this meeting, I have a good feeling 
                  about progress for the month
12:01 < jdstrand> however, if I look at 
http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-raring/canonical-security-ubuntu-13.04-month-6.html I have a less good feeling
12:02 < jdstrand> so, I guess, now that we are 2 weeks in to this month, how 
                  are the work items going? Are we 50% done? are there problems
</pre>
** jjohansen - slightly behind, no cause for concern
** sbeattie - on track
** tyhicks - slightly behind, no cause for concern
