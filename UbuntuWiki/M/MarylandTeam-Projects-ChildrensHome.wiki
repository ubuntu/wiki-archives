=== Summary ===

The Childrens Home of Catonsville, MD (www.thechildrenshome.net) was
established in 1863 as a residential care facility for children aged 8
to 21 years of age who have experienced abuse, neglect, violence,
abandonment, and/or are in need of supervised care. The campus like
setting had just added a major new educational facility in October 2007.
They were seeking corporate contributions for the facility.

=== Outcome ===

I decided to contribute two desktop computer systems that were no longer
needed in our office. They were Dell Pentium II workstations with Ubuntu
Feisty. Both systems were delivered and set up in the new facility in
October 2007. Since then the students have been using the systems'
Firefox web browser and OpenOffice applications to complete homework
assignments without any training according to the facility administrator.
