[01:13] <Cheesehead> [Topic] Global Jam Overview
[01:13] <Cheesehead> We covered a lot of ground last week.
[01:13] <Cheesehead> We have a definite Ubuntu Hour in MKE on Sept 2
[01:13] <Cheesehead> We have a couple possible IRC events on the agenda...
[01:14] <Cheesehead> Anyone want to add to the possibles?...
[01:14] <Cheesehead> And then we can gauge interest?
[01:14] <bludude> I am interested in the IRC events, but will probably not attend the Ubuntu hour
[01:15] <bigbash> Ditto, most interested in the bug event
[01:15] <Yotux> Sept 2nd holiday weekend
[01:16] <Cheesehead> Welcome, Yotux. True, holiday un the USA
[01:16] <Cheesehead> That will hurt us a bit
[01:17] <Cheesehead> But still an opportunity to get together, even if just IRC
[01:17] <Cheesehead> For most of us
[01:17] <Cheesehead> Floor is open for [IDEAS]. Doe anybody want to propose an event for Sept 2-4?
[01:17] <Cheesehead> That'
[01:17] <Cheesehead> That's not already on the agenda?
[01:19]  * Cheesehead bangs the gavel once
[01:19] <Cheesehead> OK, no new proposals.
[01:19] <Cheesehead> Let's look at the ones we already have:
[01:19] <Cheesehead> Bug Triage - anybody here have bug experience?
[01:21] <Cheesehead> Ideally, looking for somebody to volunteer to choose the date/time for an IRC bug jam, and coordinate it...
[01:21] <bigbash> I don't but I signed up for BugSquad for a mentor, but haven't heard back yet
[01:22] <Cheesehead> bigbash: I can mentor you a bit. When do you want to do it?
[01:22] <bludude> I'd also like to get involved in bugs
[01:22] <Cheesehead> Let's see some proposals for times on Sept 3 or 4...
[01:22] <bigbash> Whenever I'm on all the time, I get a lot of freedom at work and usually after 9pm
[01:23] <Cheesehead> How about Sept 4 (Sunday) 12:00 - 15:00 CDT?
[01:23] <bigbash> Works for me
[01:24] <Cheesehead> bludude? OK time?
[01:24] <bludude> probably
[01:24] <nathan_> Sound like it could work
[01:25] <Cheesehead> bigbash: Will you take charge of announcing it to the list?
=== nathan_ is now known as yotux
[01:25] <bigbash> Sure
[01:25] <yotux> Cheesehead:  do you have any focus points for this event?
[01:26] <Cheesehead> yotux: Let's send focus ideas though bigbash.
[01:26] <yotux> okay
[01:26] <Cheesehead> bigbash: You okay with that kind of coordination?
[01:27] <bigbash> Sure That works for me
[01:27] <Cheesehead> [action] Bigbash to coordinate Sunday Sept 4 IRC Bug Jam
[01:28]  * Cheesehead is always happy to advise and provide backup
[01:28] <Cheesehead> Next event:...
[01:28] <Cheesehead> Brainstorm idea triage, Sep 3 (Saturday) 12:00-15:00
[01:28] <Cheesehead> That's my baby.
[01:28] <Cheesehead> Brainstorm is a great way for people who don't...
[01:29] <Cheesehead> know much about Ubuntu's bugs and teams and upstreams and other...
[01:29] <Cheesehead> structures to learn about them.
[01:29] <Cheesehead> I sent an e-mail announcement around. I won't repeat it here.
[01:29] <yotux> I would be willing to be part of your Brainstorm
[01:29] <Cheesehead> Groovy. Thanks
[01:30] <yotux> New to bug reporting have filed a few bugs though
[01:30] <bigbash> I'd like to take part too
[01:30] <bludude> same here
[01:30] <Cheesehead> These events are both great ways to stick your toe in the water...
[01:30] <Cheesehead> without committing to deep water.
[01:31] <Cheesehead> OK,...
[01:31]  * bludude apologizes for being a bit distracted, as he is talking to his mother ATM
[01:31] <h00k> hi friends from my phone
[01:31] <Cheesehead> h00k: hey!
[01:31] <h00k> apologies for bit bring able to chair the meeting
[01:31] <h00k> being
[01:31] <Cheesehead> Let's reopen the floor one last time to new event [IDEA]s.
[01:32] <h00k> meet and greet
[01:32] <Cheesehead> Anyone have a vague interest they would like to see happen?
[01:32] <h00k> maybe Rhinelander or Superior
[01:32] <h00k> not sure where I'll be
[01:32] <Cheesehead> h00k: Cool. Are you committing to an Ubuntu hour in one of those places?
[01:32] <h00k> I'll send an email later clarifying
[01:32] <h00k> perhaps, I may be moving that weekend
[01:33] <Cheesehead> h00k: No problem. UGJ is every six months.
[01:33] <Cheesehead> As you know perfectly well
[01:33] <h00k> ;)
[01:33] <Cheesehead> Floor is still open for any new event proposals...
[01:33] <h00k> ok.gotta ruin
[01:33] <h00k> run
[01:34] <h00k> peace
[01:34] <Cheesehead> h00k: Good luck!
[01:34] <Cheesehead> Going once...
[01:34] <Cheesehead> Going twice...
[01:35]  * Cheesehead bangs the gavel
[01:35] <Cheesehead> Oh yeah...
[01:35] <Cheesehead> [action] Cheesehaed coordinated Brainstorm Triage
[01:35] <Cheesehead> Last item on the agenda...

</pre>
<pre>
[01:36] <Cheesehead> [Topic] T-shirts? (Artwork)
[01:36] <bludude> cool idea
[01:36] <Cheesehead> Some discussion last week, some interest.
[01:36] <Cheesehead> We need some such art.
[01:36] <yotux> Interested no an artist sorry
[01:36] <yotux> T shirt or polo?
[01:36] <Cheesehead> Well, let's stick with artwork for now
[01:36] <bludude> my art skills are rather lacking. I would go for a t-shirt
[01:37] <Cheesehead> Shirt buys at this point are premature without art.
[01:37] <Cheesehead> Art also goes on the website, etc.
[01:37] <Cheesehead> Who has done shirt buys fore for a group?
[01:37] <yotux> Cheesehead:  what type of art are you looking for?
[01:37] <yotux> May have some non ubuntu contacts I could tap
[01:38] <Cheesehead> Something cool for a website and a t-shirt
[01:38] <Cheesehead> Maybe a poster
[01:38] <Cheesehead> Something that says UBUNTU and WISCONSIN and COOL
[01:39] <Cheesehead> I suspect we're looking for concepts more than details at this point
[01:39] <Cheesehead> But if someone's friend or talented spouse happens to come through...
[01:39] <Cheesehead> ...that would be great.
[01:40] <Cheesehead> If you have such a friend, and a beer or two to pay them with,...
[01:40] <Cheesehead> then post the result on the mailing list to gather some feedback...
[01:40] <Cheesehead> and we can gauge interest at the next IRC meeting.
[01:41] <Cheesehead> Once we have a concept that a quorum likes, then we can specialize it into shirts and web art, etc.
[01:41] <yotux> I am a ham radio operator.  Have a follow radio op that is a photographer.
[01:41] <Cheesehead> yotux: Great!
[01:41] <yotux> Thinking out loud:  Ubuntu circle with a twist of wisconsin?
[01:42] <Cheesehead> yotux: Possible. I'd need to see it.
[01:42] <yotux> maybe a cheesehead is the middle?  not sure
[01:42] <Cheesehead> yotux: Or a cow. Or a fishing boat. :)
[01:42] <bludude> Canonical doesn't often play nice with mods of the Ubuntu logo, be advised
[01:43] <Cheesehead> bludude: Good point. There are guidelines for that.
[01:43] <yotux> thanks will do some legal work with Canonical
[01:43] <yotux> legal should have been leg
[01:44] <Cheesehead> [action] yotux will research Ubuntu Trademark guidelines for logo use.
[01:44] <Cheesehead> And anyone else, if you have a concept, put it on the mailing list.
[01:44] <Cheesehead> Any problems with that course of action?
[01:45] <yotux> Fair
[01:45]  * Cheesehead bangs the gavel
[01:45] <yotux> or second action
[01:46] <Cheesehead> Any last meeting business?...
[01:46] <Cheesehead> That was the final agenda topic.
[01:46] <Cheesehead> I don't know h00k's plan for the next meeting date. I know it will go out over the mailing list
[01:47] <Cheesehead> Everyone, thanks again for coming!
[01:47] <Cheesehead> #endmeeting
[01:47] <Cheesehead> Drinks in the atrium
