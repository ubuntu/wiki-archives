=== About ===

I am a Linux user since the early 90’s, I have tried many distributions including RedHat, Fedora, Slackware and Ubuntu.

I’ve been on IRC for over 20 years and since 2018 I’m part of the IRC Italy Ubuntu operators group.

In Italy I was the founder of a Linux User Group. I currently live and work in Germany.

You can find my contributions to the community <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~mrpan | Launchpad profile]]</nowiki>

I contribute every day to test ubuntu distributions under development as a bug tracker

I have been contributing for years by giving my technical support on the Italian channels of #ubuntu-it and #debian-it on libera.chat and on the Italian forum ...

'''''Fabio Trovato''''' 01/01/2022 at 11.23AM on <nowiki>[[https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/mrpan-membership-application/25706/14 | Discourse]]</nowiki> :

Hi all!
I have been a member of the Ubuntu Italian IRC Operators team since 2008 and I have been an administrator of the same since 2017.

Mrpan, like Carlin0, has been a member of the Ubuntu Italian IRC Operators team since 2018. I voted in favor when the Ubuntu-it IRC team evaluated his admission as a member.
Mrpan is very skilled and competent in Ubuntu technical support, probably also because he works as a system and network administrator. He is also good at managing IRC channels.
He is a quiet and kind person in IRC channels, even when he deals with rude people.
Like Carlin0, he is very present in IRC channels of Ubuntu-it community.

For these reasons, I endorse his membership application.
