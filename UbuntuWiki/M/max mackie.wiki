=== About Me ===
My name is Max Mackie (Max_Mackie on the forums) and I've been using various Ubuntu flavors for about three years now. I'm currently living in Montreal, Canada and am working towards a degree in Computer Engineering. I've participated in a worldwide science fair (sponsored by Bell Telecommunications) and finished 7th in the provincials (if my team and I would have finished 6th, we would have gone to the nationals :( ). We were presenting different penetration tests and how to protect against potential hacker threats. 

My main hobbies are mostly revolved around either computers, programming, reading or developing something. I love tinkering with electronics and trying to build stuff out of literally nothing. Some things I've made include small Arduino robots and an automatic toilet paper dispenser (don't ask). I love reading any kind of book but prefer dystopian, fantasy and cyberpunk books. An exception to this would be manuals ... I loooove reading manuals.

I've only recently joined the Ubuntu community, but it's satisfying helping others with problems I myself have faced. The way I see it, you have to fall head first before realizing why you fell.

=== Future Plans & Projects ===
