== Issues with initramfs ==
 The initramfs loads a lot of modules, and then tries to find the root filesystem

* (it waits in a loop until the root filesystem magically pops out of magic, that
 is by processing kernel events happening in the background)
 
* We load modules in the initramfs that we don't need to.

* We configure the console in the initramfs so that usplash can work, and the keyboard is configured when initramfs drops to shell.
=== Improvements ===
* We should use a prebuilt modules.dep file instead of running depmod -a during boot.	

   Colin then shows a bootchart that looks ... interesting, but pointless.

* bootchart could be started earlier to give additional information. It would need to be integrated into 'init' directly.

* calls to udevadm settle can be removed from /etc/init.d/udev

* we load fuse on every system. this might be not necessary. It can most probably loaded later. Network cards can be dropped too, potentially, if root isn't on NFS.
