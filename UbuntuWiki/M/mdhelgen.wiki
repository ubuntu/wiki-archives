About Me:

I'm a 4th year Computer Science major at Michigan Tech University. I've been interested in getting involved with open source for quite a while, but this is my first real jump into the community. I'd like to eventually contribute code as a developer, but the Bug Squad seems like a good opportunity to get involved and familiar.

I don't have any specific area of interest or specialization yet, but I enjoy learning how and why most things work.

My current availability is roughly anywhere within 18:00 - 04:00 UTC (local 14:00 - 0:00 EDT)
