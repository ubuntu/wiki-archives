'''FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE'''

== Inaugural Ubuntu Massachusetts Installfest Gets Green Light ==

BOSTON—The Massachusetts Local team for the Ubuntu Linux operating system has announced the date for the first-ever Massachusetts Installfest.  The festival will take place on October 13 from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. at MIT’s Media Library in Cambridge.

The festival is an opportunity for the Ubuntu team to show normal computer users how easy using the Linux software has become. Volunteers will be on hand to answer questions, present demonstrations and help users install the free, open source Linux operating system.  Ubuntu CDs, case badges, drinks and snacks will be available.

"Our team wants to bring the possibilities of Ubuntu to the entire Bay State area,” said Mike Rushton, the Massachusetts organizer for Ubuntu.  “Most installfests focus primarily on advanced users, but we want to broaden our focus to include all users.  Ubuntu lets people breathe new life into older computers that would normally be considered out of date, allowing them to support the latest technologies and get more value from their machines.”

''The Ubuntu Massachusetts team wants to grow the ecosystem of individuals, companies, non-profit organizations, educational institutions, and governmental and intergovernmental institutions working with Ubuntu Linux in Massachusetts. The team offers advice, expertise and a range of events to help any kind of organization or individual understand the power and simplicity of open source solutions.''
