== About Me ==

I'm a graduate student and IT professional with experience in Web development and education.  My first experience with a Unix-based system was in early 1995, using telnet client (in Windows 3.1) to connect to an IBM AIX server.  For the next decade, my experience with Unix-based systems was limited to terminal access to servers, mostly for Web development and administration.  Then, in 2006 a friend told me about a (relatively) new distribution of Linux targeted at the desktop and focused on ease of use, so I installed Ubuntu 6.06 (Dapper Drake) on a spare desktop to try it out.  A year later, I was dual-booting Windows XP and Ubuntu 7.04 (Feisty Fawn) on my laptop, and using Ubuntu for most tasks.  Now, in 2009, Linux is my primary OS, installed on all my computers.  I still dual-boot with Windows, but only for the rare occasion I absolutely ''must'' use Windows-specific applications.
