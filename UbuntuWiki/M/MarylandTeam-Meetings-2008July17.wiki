=== Agenda ===

At the July 9th <nowiki>[[http://www.calug.org|CALug]]</nowiki> meeting there will be a presentation on [htp://www.gnupg.org GPG]. 

Many times after you go home from one of these presentations you start to experiment a little and run into questions. Therefore the Ubuntu Maryland team is opening our July meeting to members of the CALug and anyone else who has questions on the use of GPG. Please feel free to bring your laptops and/or questions on generating GnuPG keys, the use of the command line, email integration and front ends. We will do our best to help you through any issues you have. 

We will attempt to have a few demo machines if you do not have a laptop available to you.
