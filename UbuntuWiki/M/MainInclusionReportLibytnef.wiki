** package provides libytnef0 and libytnef0-dev, the run-time library and the development files for usage of the library.
** a related package (ytnef) provides a command-line interface for manipulation of the TNEF files, but is not required: Evolution provides the necessary interface.
** the tnef-attachment plugin addresses a major inconvenience of Evolution users receiving emails generated by Outlook, with the dreaded 'winmail.dat' file attached. This file is created using the Microsoft Transport Neutral Encapsulation Format (so TNEF), and carries many different goodies, including ICS and others. Evolution upstream has released this attachment on the last stable version, but it has not yet been put available for Ubuntu users due to the lack of a MIR for libytnef
** What do upstream call this software ?  Has it had different names in the past ? Upstream calls it "Yerase's TNEF Stream Reader". No previous known names; released by author.
