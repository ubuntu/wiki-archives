 16:00:19 <rbasak> #topic Review ACTION points from previous meeting

 16:00:25 <rbasak> • arosales to investigate why status tracker is not picking up all servercloud area BPs

 16:00:35 <rbasak> Hey arosales. Is the agenda actually current?

 16:01:08 <arosales> Hello

 16:01:22 <arosales> rbasak: ya I took a look. Some of the BPs were missing work items.

 16:01:34 <arosales> as soon as the work items are added it should pick it up.

 16:01:46 <arosales> reminder to all to not include the string "work item" in the white board too :-)

 16:02:10 <rbasak> arosales: ok, thanks!

 16:02:25 <rbasak> So that takes us to the next action item:

 16:02:27 <rbasak> • all, check status of assigned Work Items and refresh if necessary

 16:02:51 <jamespage> o/

 16:02:58 <zul> hilo

 16:03:17 <rbasak> So we should all do that :)

 16:03:33 <arosales> :-)

 16:03:35 <rbasak> #topic Raring Development

 16:04:02 <rbasak> jamespage: over to you?

 16:04:19 <rbasak> In the agenda we have:

 16:04:22 <rbasak> #link http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-r-tracking-bug-tasks.html#server

 16:04:30 <jamespage> rbasak, sure

 16:05:13 <jamespage> OK - so the maas bug list is looking much better - just a few outstanding

 16:05:26 <jamespage> thanks roaksoax and the maas tema

 16:05:33 <jamespage> looks like we have a few new ones

 16:05:57 <jamespage> zul, bug 1099382

 16:05:59 <ubottu> bug 1099382 in quantum (Ubuntu Raring) "quantum: Raring depwait on universe package alembic" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1099382

 16:06:07 <jamespage> I think that can be closed out now right?

 16:06:19 <jamespage> bug 1090593

 16:06:21 <ubottu> bug 1090593 in bind9 (Ubuntu Raring) " D.ROOT-SERVERS.NET changing January 3rd 2013" [Medium,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1090593

 16:06:56 <jamespage> that one needs to be SRU'ed as well - I note that lamont has prepared packages already - any takers?

 16:06:59 <jamespage> maybe rbasak?

 16:07:25 <rbasak> Sure, I can pick that up

 16:07:34 <rbasak> Need to check that it's fixed in raring first

 16:07:38 <jamespage> I sadly have not fixed bug 671065 yet

 16:07:41 <ubottu> bug 671065 in dovecot (Ubuntu) "deliver broken because dovecot.conf uses !include_try" [Medium,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/671065

 16:07:45 * jamespage berates himself

 16:07:56 <jamespage> hallyn, bug 1092715

 16:07:57 <ubottu> bug 1092715 in qemu-kvm (Ubuntu Raring) "udevadm trigger --action=change not working in quantal and raring" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1092715

 16:08:50 <jamespage> ah - right - hallyn wants to make that invalid - some sort of inotify bug on some systems - that would reflect some of the behaviour I have seen

 16:09:30 <hallyn> jamespage: i'm talking with pitti right now about the first part of that

 16:09:35 <jamespage> smoser, bug 1100920 under control?

 16:09:36 <ubottu> bug 1100920 in cloud-init (Ubuntu Raring) "In Ubuntu 12.10, the legacy 'user' cloud-config option is not handled properly" [Medium,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1100920

 16:09:40 <jamespage> hallyn, nice one

 16:09:55 <jamespage> I *still* need to get the package list updated for that report

 16:10:16 <jamespage> so - http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-raring/group/topic-raring-servercloud-overview.html

 16:10:28 <smoser> jamespage, yes.

 16:11:28 <jamespage> picking on the reds

 16:11:30 <jamespage> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-r-openstack-ha

 16:11:46 <jamespage> is moving forwards - hopefully good working set of charms for grizzly by end of feb

 16:12:12 <jamespage> zul: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-r-openstack-grizzly

 16:12:28 <zul> ill update it today

 16:12:37 <jamespage> zul, but generally OK right?

 16:12:44 <zul> yeah

 16:12:54 <jamespage> smoser: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-r-image-access

 16:13:34 <jamespage> and hallyn: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-r-binfmtns

 16:13:53 <smoser> i'll update state there today. we're making good progress recently.

 16:14:05 <jamespage> smoser, nice one

 16:14:20 <jamespage> smb: I note actions on https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-r-kdump-tool for you - hows that going?

 16:14:28 <hallyn> jamespage: yeah, i need to talk to smb and cjwatson about that binfmtns, but i think we'll postpone that

 16:14:36 <hallyn> one action item on there i hope to get to today, actually

 16:14:44 <hallyn> but the rest i just don't know we have time for this cycle

 16:15:05 <jamespage> hallyn, OK _ I suggest you leave in place for the time being and do a status update in the whiteboard

 16:15:07 <smb> jamespage, Finished a bit on that today, working with other to get other things together

 16:15:08 <jamespage> we can defer later

 16:15:14 <jamespage> smb, good-oh

 16:15:16 * jamespage sighs

 16:15:17 <jamespage> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-r-seeded-qa-workflow

 16:15:20 <hallyn> jamespage: yes, i'm not defering yet, i'm still hoping to talk to them :)

 16:15:24 * jamespage hits himself round the head

 16:15:36 <smb> hallyn, Have not looked into that yet

 16:15:42 <jamespage> OK _ so that is moving very slowly

 16:15:48 <hallyn> smb: i think the first steps belong to myself and cjwatson

 16:15:56 <hallyn> (but we shouldn't talk about that here i guess :)

 16:16:09 <smb> hallyn, ok, agree. :)

 16:17:05 <jamespage> re ^^ seeded-qa-workflow

 16:17:17 <jamespage> hmm - well if people get time please try towrite some tests.

 16:17:34 <Daviey> \o/

 16:17:45 <jamespage> its lower priority that other work folk have on but if anyone from the ubuntu-server community has time please steal work items!

 16:18:04 <jamespage> Daviey, https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-r-cloudarchive

 16:18:48 <jamespage> smoser: guess https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-r-openstack-ubuntu-images follows the blueprint above...

 16:19:15 <jamespage> anyway - things generally look OK; please keep you blueprints updated (weekly if poss) so we can continue to track progress

 16:19:21 <jamespage> rbasak, back to you

 16:19:36 <smoser> yes

 16:19:38 <rbasak> #topic Ubuntu Server Team Events

 16:19:53 <Daviey> This weekend FOSDEM

 16:19:55 <rbasak> We noted last time that FOSDEM is coming up. Me, Daviey and jamespage are going.

 16:20:03 <jamespage> w00t!

 16:20:16 <arosales> Scale11x at the end of feb (http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale11x/)

 16:20:27 <jamespage> catch "Automating Openstack testing on Ubuntu" at 1150 on Saturday morning in the Testing Automation devroom

 16:20:35 * jamespage goes to write the slides

 16:20:40 <arosales> :-)

 16:21:03 * jamespage apologises for the shameless self promotion

 16:21:13 * Daviey adds it to his diary

 16:21:36 <rbasak> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (hggdh)

 16:21:50 <rbasak> hggdh: around?

 16:21:58 <hggdh> nothing noteworthy from me. Any questions for me?

 16:22:20 <jamespage> o/

 16:22:32 <hggdh> yessah?

 16:22:34 <jamespage> hggdh: do you have any details of the testing schedule for 12.04.2?

 16:23:25 <hggdh> jamespage: nothing should change from what we currently do; but we are going to add new jobs to cater for 12.04.2 (as opposed to 12.04.1)

 16:23:51 <hggdh> these jobs should be a copy of hte current ones, only using the updated iso

 16:24:13 <hggdh> as soon as we have an usable image we should start

 16:24:16 <hggdh> ..

 16:25:04 <rbasak> OK, thanks hggdh!

 16:25:05 <rbasak> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb)

 16:25:14 <smb> Hm, cannot think of something worthwhile to report. Are there questions?

 16:26:09 <smb> sounds like a no...

 16:26:15 <rbasak> I guess not. Thanks smb!

 16:26:20 <rbasak> Weekly Updates & Questions regarding Ubuntu ARM Server (rbasak)

 16:26:25 <rbasak> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions regarding Ubuntu ARM Server (rbasak)

 16:26:33 <rbasak> rbasak: any questions?

 16:26:43 <rbasak> Nothing new! Any questions for me?

 16:26:44 <rbasak> :)

 16:27:15 <rbasak> #topic Open Discussion

 16:27:21 <rbasak> Looks like this will be a quick meeting :)

 16:27:28 <arosales> quick question

 16:27:45 <arosales> hggdh: for my learning :-)  are the tests you are looking at for server at http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/qatracker/milestones/243/builds

 16:27:52 <arosales> for this example it would be raring daily

 16:28:08 <arosales> or are there other tests ?

 16:28:50 <smoser> i do have a general discussion item

 16:29:04 * arosales may have missed hggdh . .  .

 16:29:05 <hggdh> arosales: for the ISO testing should be similar to these, but for Precise.

 16:29:11 <smoser> Februrary 14 is "Alpha 2 for opt-in flavors" (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RaringRingtail/ReleaseSchedule)

 16:29:36 <hggdh> arosales: plus manual testing, and kernel testing

 16:29:46 <arosales> hggdh: are those tracked else where?

 16:30:03 <smoser> personally, i feel that we should have some concentrated test prior to and at least produce a coherant image.

 16:30:21 <smoser> at least for cloud-images, we keep "release" images indefinitely and its ueful to have a stick in the mud

 16:30:29 <smoser> does anyone have any disagreements or thoughts?

 16:30:36 <hggdh> arosales: the ISO testing will be tracked at iso.qa.u.c (together with manual tests), the kernel tests in Jenkins

 16:31:18 <utlemming> smoser: I agree with producing an alpha2

 16:32:03 <arosales> hggdh: ok, thanks for the info. I'll take a look at http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/ and https://jenkins.qa.ubuntu.com/view/SRU%20Kernel/ for server testing coverage

 16:32:18 <smoser> jamespage, Daviey ?

 16:32:34 <smoser> i'm suggesting we run around like headless chickens to produce something that no one will use

 16:32:39 <rbasak> smoser: cloud images only, or CD images as well?

 16:33:16 <arosales> cloud images are moving to  3 week release cycle following the kernel.  Those images would have further testing and perhaps more content update than a daily.

 16:33:47 <jamespage> smoser, I'd +1 a cloud-image for a2

 16:33:48 <utlemming> arosales: except raring is exempted from that cadence until post-GA

 16:34:04 <jamespage> utlemming, I was hoping you might say that :-)

 16:34:20 <arosales> utlemming: ah, good point for dev

 16:35:07 * arosales apologizes for the incorrect info there for raring.  Thanks for the correction utlemming :-)

 16:35:24 <arosales> I think we just need to notify the release team we want to opt in for A2

 16:36:00 <smoser> rbasak, i dont know about cd images.

 16:36:09 <smoser> i personally find the excercise useful

 16:36:21 <smoser> and think that by actually tryint to do things, we'll find lots of fallout

 16:37:41 <rbasak> OK sounds like most are in favour of a cloud A2 image anyway

 16:37:54 <rbasak> smoser: do you want to take an action to push that forwards?

 16:38:08 <smoser> sure.

 16:38:31 <rbasak> #action smoser to push A2 cloud image forwards

 16:38:31 * meetingology smoser to push A2 cloud image forwards

 16:38:46 <rbasak> Anything else for Open Discussion?

 16:38:55 <utlemming> rbasak: actually that should be my action

 16:39:38 <rbasak> utlemming: ok we'll make it your action. Not sure how to tell meetingology that though :-)

 16:39:49 * rbasak will fix it in the minutes

 16:40:03 <rbasak> #topic Announce next meeting date and time

 16:40:10 <rbasak> The next meeting will be at Tue, 5 Feb 2013 16:00:00 +0000. The chair will be jamespage!

 16:40:15 <jamespage> w00t!

 16:40:21 <jamespage> thanks rbasak

 16:40:23 <rbasak> #endmeeting
