   03:01    janimo        ok let's start
   03:01    janimo        hello all
   03:01    Gloubiboulga  hi Jani
   03:01    janimo        https://wiki.ubuntu.com/XubuntuMeetingAgenda
   03:02    janimo        hi Gauvain
   03:02    janimo        item 1) mail client
   03:02    janimo        it was discussed previously that we should go one of the sylpheeds
   03:02    janimo        preferebaly claws
   03:03    nomed         janimo, i agree
   03:03    Gloubiboulga  sounds logical, it's lighter than TB
   03:03    nomed         but maybe for dapper wouldn't it better to use thunderbird ?
   03:03    janimo        there is still no mail client in the default desktop
   03:03    nomed         i mean ... any problem to get it in main ?
   03:03    janimo        I summarized lightly the pros/cons I see with sylpheed/t-bird no client
   03:03    janimo        on that pahe
   03:04    janimo        nomed, not as much of a problem of getting it in main
   03:04    janimo        s/pahe/page/
   03:04    janimo        but subsequent support
   03:04    janimo        I did not hear bad things about s-claws
   03:04    janimo        but did not use it either
   03:05    janimo        I do not know how it stands re stability and security
   03:05    nomed         from what i know it should be ok
   03:05    janimo        I remember Colin (sylpheed claws developer) assured us on xubuntu-devel that all is good
   03:05    nomed         yep i remember
   03:05    janimo        so the only con is that it is not in main and we'd put another extra package  in the list
                          to support
   03:06    janimo        I am wondering if this is worth it considering that most non-techincal people will not use
                          pop/imap/nntp AFAIK
   03:06    nomed         i think xubuntu should have a mail client
   03:06    janimo        and those who do will pick their favourite client anyway
   03:07    janimo        nomed: that's waht I was thinking about. should it?
   03:07    nomed         sylpheed claws  as first for me
   03:07    nomed         if there are problems ... thunderbird
   03:07    nomed         but we should have one
   03:08    janimo        how do we know there are problems
   03:08    janimo        and what are problems in this context?
   03:08    janimo        the latest claws is still not in dapper form what I saw
   03:08    nomed         we'd put another extra package  in the list to support<--
   03:09    janimo        neither claws not t-bird do what evolution does not by default at least (cal, palm sync,
                          talk to exchange etc)
   03:09    janimo        so the corpporate desktop scenario where users must use such a client is not valid imho
   03:09    janimo        whereas normal people mostly use the web
   03:10    janimo        a web interface for mail I mean
   03:10    nomed         yes that's true
   03:10    irvin         janimo: i agree with that
   === mgalvin [n=mgalvin@ubuntu/member/mgalvin] has joined #ubuntu-meeting
   03:10    janimo        what I don't know is how many people would use a pop/imap client just as naturally as they
                          do gaim/firefox
   03:10    nomed         but on a distro i would expect a mail client anyway ...
   03:10    janimo        it is not the tipical non-geek use case
   03:11    janimo        nomed, yes that expectance I am aware of, was just thinking it may need revisiting
   03:11    nomed         janimo, at the moment there is not a mail client that can do the same as evolution
   03:11    janimo        kmail and evo are shipped not necessarily because of this expectance but because they are
                          core parts of gnoom/kde
   03:11    nomed         from what i know
   03:12    nomed         but thunderbird exists even for windows users
   03:12    janimo        nomed, that is a blessing actually :)
   03:12    janimo        re evolution not windows
   03:12    janimo        nomed, s-claws runs on win32 too
   03:12    janimo        original sylpheed does at least
   03:13    nomed         it should yes
   03:13    nomed         but i think most of windows users uses thunderbird if not outlook
   03:13    janimo        so maybe we should release the first ISO's with no mail client and state that in the
                          announcement
   03:13    nomed         yep
   03:13    janimo        if the feedback is mostly negative recosider
   03:14    janimo        I find t-birds interface more usable than sylpheeds so that is a plus
   03:14    janimo        too bad it's not as light
   03:14    janimo        other opinions?
   03:15    ranf          Is mutt in main?
   03:15    nomed         as gnu/linux user i would have claws
   03:15    janimo        ranf, I suppose but that's not GUI
   03:15    nomed         but as new gnu/linux user i guess i would be happy to see thunderbird
   03:15    janimo        opinions whether to have a mail client by default or not for now
   03:15    janimo        not which one to pick
   03:16    janimo        nomed, indeed the emphasis should be on new users as with the rest of the desktop
   03:16    nomed         well ... i think we should have one as i told
   03:16    janimo        the more experienced ones know they way around to pick their favourite
   03:16    nomed         janimo, what i think is that if galago will be part of dapper +1
   03:16    nomed         then we should follow claws development
   03:17    nomed         but for dapper thunderbird is the best one i think
   03:17    janimo        nomed, do they collaborate or why?
   03:18    janimo        galago and claws  I mean
   03:18    nomed         janimo, when the claws devel contacted xubuntu
   03:18    nomed         i asked if it was possible to integrate galago
   03:18    nomed         and he told he didn't know that stuff
   03:18    nomed         but he was happy to work on that
   03:19    janimo        nomed, ah ok. Anyway we'll see if galago will be part of dapper +1 first
   03:19    nomed         that's why i was thinking claws should be the xubuntu mail client
   03:19    nomed         and that's why i think at the moment thunderbird is the best one
   03:19    janimo        but since galago is not here yet that cannot be a reason for claws at this moment
   03:19    janimo        ok
   03:20    janimo        item 2) xrachiver
   03:20    janimo        not much to discuss here right?
   03:20    nomed         yep
   03:20    janimo        seems well on track with upstream collaborating
   03:21    nomed         exactly
   03:21    janimo        Gloubiboulga: do you know what the exact problems are with xkb?
   03:21    janimo        does upstream test on dapper by any chance?
   03:22    Gloubiboulga  janimo, yes, it doesn't detect the different keymaps
   03:22    Gloubiboulga  he works on debian unstable
   03:22    Gloubiboulga  I try to see how he could use libxkeyboard
   03:22    janimo        ok that's close enough
   03:22    Gloubiboulga  libxklavier*
   03:22    janimo        :)
   03:22    janimo        so it does not yet work for him either on debian?
   03:23    irvin         can i butt in a quick question (i hope it's not offtopic)... i only saw abiword as the
                          office suite in xubuntu, is there a plan to include others (e.g., gnumeric)?
   03:23    Gloubiboulga  it does work for him, but the plugin doesn't manage all the config possibilities of X
   03:23    janimo        irvin, gnumeric will probably be on the CD but not by default
   03:23    janimo        as it uses gnome deps which so far we had not time to tackle
   03:24    irvin         i see
   03:24    janimo        upstream is buildable without gnome but the debian packaging does not take advantage of
                          this
   03:24    janimo        irvin, do you think it is a porb if it is not installed by default?
   03:24    janimo        Gloubiboulga: ok but he'll probably figure it out I guess.
   03:24    Gloubiboulga  janimo, yes, I think he will
   03:24    irvin         janimo: yes i think so
   03:25    janimo        irvin, why?
   === mgalvin [n=mgalvin@ubuntu/member/mgalvin] has joined #ubuntu-meeting
   03:26    janimo        the speardsheet is one of the apps I also think are not for most regular users
   03:26    janimo        unlike a word processor
   03:26    janimo        hence the lower priority in getting it in shape
   03:27    irvin         janimo: i beg to differ, but i see a lot of spreadsheet users on low-end computers
   03:27    janimo        irvin, fair enough
   03:27    irvin         janimo: there should be at least a word processor and a spreadsheet app in xubuntu
   03:28    janimo        but aren;t they more specialized users than average home user?
   03:28    irvin         janimo: personally i use more often, as i deal with numbers (engineering work) all the time
   03:28    janimo        like, office people and such
   03:28    janimo        ok, engineers, clerks etc
   03:28    janimo        but gramma? :)
   03:28    nomed         janimo, students in general may need it ....
   03:29    janimo        as with the email app I am trying to think not in terms of what a regular advert looks for
                          an os (document,spreadsheets,music, mail)
   03:29    janimo        but actually what is getting used more often
   03:30    janimo        especially in schools, net cafes, shared terminal in libraries and such
   03:30    nomed         janimo, yes i understand
   03:30    janimo        but I know it is essential for some users so it i=definitely is on the CD
   03:30    janimo        I am just wondering about the default install
   03:31    janimo        and the only thing preventing the latter is that gnumeric stil has gnome deps
   03:31    nomed         janimo, gnumeric is not gnome free
   03:31    irvin         janimo: what's wrong with having it installed by default?
   03:31    nomed         so ..
   03:31    nomed         we can work on it .. but we 're still few devels
   03:31    janimo        irvin, we had a semi-official policy for xubuntu
   03:31    nomed         i hope for dapper +1 this will change
   03:31    irvin         i guess we'll have to look for an alternative to gnumeric
   03:31    janimo        not having gnome/kde apps in the defaqult install
   03:31    janimo        to keep install slim
   03:32    janimo        irvin, no gnomeric is the best alternaive I am sure no need for alternatives
   03:32    Gloubiboulga  it looks like gnumeric can be built without gnome stuff, someone tested this already ?
   03:32    janimo        Gloubiboulga: I know it works since it runs on windows :)
   03:32    Gloubiboulga  in this case, why not creating a gnumeric-gtk package ?
   03:32    janimo        I talked to the debian maintainer and he said he'd take clean patches to make a
                          gnumeric-gtk binary too
   03:32    janimo        but it is not too easy
   03:33    Gloubiboulga  ok
   03:33    janimo        since it depends on libgoffice
   03:33    janimo        which can also build without gnome
   03:33    janimo        so we need to 1) make a goffice and goffice-gtk
   03:33    janimo        then a gnumeric-gtk which uses goffice-gtk
   03:33    janimo        it is actually doable just was a mess when I tried last time

   === mjmac [n=mjmac@pdpc/supporter/active/mjmac] has joined #ubuntu-meeting
   03:34    janimo        given the interest, the 6 extra weeks and that I'd also like gnumeric installed by default
                          I think this needs another try
   03:34    Gloubiboulga  yep
   03:34    janimo        Gloubiboulga: would you be interested? :)
   03:35    Gloubiboulga  yes, I am :)
   03:35    nomed         cool!
   03:35    irvin         \o/ for Gloubiboulga
   03:35    janimo        ok let's discuss this after the meeting
   03:35    janimo        which may be right now :)
   03:35    Gloubiboulga  I'll call for help if I fail ;)
   03:35    janimo        \0/ for Gloubiboulga
   03:35    Gloubiboulga  janimo, sorry I have to leave right now (already late)
   03:36    janimo        ideally we'd cooperate with upstream debian packager since he was open to the idea
   03:36    janimo        just did not want to do it himself
   03:36    janimo        Gloubiboulga: np
   03:36    janimo        we can discuss another time
   03:36    Gloubiboulga  ok
   03:36    Gloubiboulga  cu later
   03:36    janimo        irvin: ok so thanks for prodding we'll take a shot at tthis
   03:36    irvin         ok
   03:36    irvin         janimo: no prob
   03:37    janimo        ok if there's nothing else to talk about
   03:38    nomed         janimo, shouldn't be removed from mirrors old pkges ?
   03:38    janimo        we can end the meeting
   03:38    janimo        nomed, right we should
   03:38    janimo        but that needs communicating with LP admins or whoever else
   03:38    janimo        I think there's a wikipage with candidates for removal
   03:38    janimo        I don;t know which is it
   03:38    janimo        and I think someone regularly purges it
   03:38    janimo        but this may just be a myth
   03:39    nomed         any of them here ?
   03:39    janimo        we definitely need to purge our old packages before release
   03:39    nomed         we can list all of them and ask then ..
   03:39    janimo        I don;t think any xfce package is put there,no
   03:39    janimo        nomed, sure
   === kentborg [n=kentborg@static-71-243-117-126.bos.east.verizon.net] has joined #ubuntu-meeting
   03:39    janimo        the ones we talked about last time right?
   03:39    janimo        old plugins + toys
   03:40    nomed         yes
   03:40    janimo        if you find that page feel free to add them :)
   03:40    nomed         k :)
   03:40    janimo        but with plugins which are not explicitely superceded wait a bit later
   03:40    janimo        since they may get ported
   03:40    nomed         sure
   03:40    janimo        by dapper
   03:41    janimo        ok
   03:41    janimo        thanks
   03:41    nomed         cu next meeting
   03:41    janimo        ok, end of meeting I'll try to summarize it and send a mail
   03:41    janimo        bye all
