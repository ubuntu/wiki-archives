<pre>
Mar 16 20:02:10 <gringochapin>	Our local jams will be part of the global jam, held from the 26-28 of this month.
Mar 16 20:03:01 <Iowan>	I guess we're officially "on"
Mar 16 20:03:11 <Iowan>	PRESENT
Mar 16 20:03:33 <jimerickson>	present
Mar 16 20:03:34 <Iowan>	(actually, that's for Mootbot - which we don't use- yet)
Mar 16 20:03:34 <gringochapin>	We'll probably be doing a lot of testing of Lucid, and maybe some bug or doc fixing.
Mar 16 20:04:17 <gringochapin>	Present. (I don't care. I just like to say it.)
Mar 16 20:04:39 <Iowan>	(If it trips your trigger - say it again :)
Mar 16 20:04:54 <Infl8ableSoulm8>	Present is good.  Presents are better.
Mar 16 20:05:21 <gringochapin>	:)
Mar 16 20:05:57 <Iowan>	What's the great news about IC location?
Mar 16 20:06:21 <gringochapin>	Well, I got a room in the IC public library.
Mar 16 20:06:50 <gringochapin>	It's basically a room with ethernet (only one port so we'll need a hub) and a large conference table.
Mar 16 20:06:58 <Iowan>	I take it ACM evaporated?
Mar 16 20:07:08 <Iowan>	Library is OK!!!
Mar 16 20:07:11 <gringochapin>	If we are too many, we can spill out into the library proper.
Mar 16 20:07:29 <gringochapin>	ACM... who knows.  Flaked.  Never heard back.
Mar 16 20:07:56 <Iowan>	Their loss - we could have made them look SOOO good...
Mar 16 20:08:06 <Iowan>	Maybe next year!
Mar 16 20:08:20 <gringochapin>	Anyway, we have the room from 1:00-6:00 on the 27th (Saturday) in room E of the ICPL.
Mar 16 20:09:10 <gringochapin>	Agreed. I plan to show up at 12:30 for setup (they scheduled that too, so if anyone else wants to come a little early, you're welcome.)
Mar 16 20:09:38 <Iowan>	VERY Thanks for finding us a place
Mar 16 20:09:55 <gringochapin>	Glad to help.
Mar 16 20:11:14 <gringochapin>	Here's the link from the library.
Mar 16 20:11:16 <gringochapin>	http://calendar.icpl.org/view.php?did=14970
Mar 16 20:11:24 <gringochapin>	If anyone cares.
Mar 16 20:11:43 <gringochapin>	Now what about Des Moines?
Mar 16 20:12:11 <gringochapin>	And how can we advertise the crap out of this event?  Craigslist, I'll tweet, but what else?
Mar 16 20:12:36 <Iowan>	I was eavesdropping on earlier discussion for DM
Mar 16 20:12:51 *	F0o (~chatzilla@173-28-62-125.client.mchsi.com) has joined #ubuntu-us-ia
Mar 16 20:13:18 <Iowan>	There's the "registration" page - which I see got deprecated
Mar 16 20:14:00 <Iowan>	With a time/site, I'll try to get it updated/moved
Mar 16 20:14:31 <gringochapin>	Someone should update the events page on the Ubuntu wiki.
Mar 16 20:14:52 <gringochapin>	With at least the IC time and place.
Mar 16 20:15:26 <Iowan>	I'll try to get the logs transcribed, then I'll have something to reference - otherwise my memory fails me
Mar 16 20:15:47 <gringochapin>	Funny that KWierso isn't here, seeing as how he sent the reminder to the list.
Mar 16 20:16:19 <F0o>	gringochapin: no doubt
Mar 16 20:16:23 <Iowan>	We'll keep the channel busy for awhile - he may yet come by.
Mar 16 20:16:38 <Iowan>	Busy is good (that's my motto at work)
Mar 16 20:16:58 <gringochapin>	So, does anyone know of any other sites with local community calendars for the area?
Mar 16 20:17:27 <gringochapin>	or have any ideas on how to publicize?
Mar 16 20:18:08 <gringochapin>	Testing, debugging, writing docs, ETC. is fun, but I wouldn't mind a few folks showing up who are "simply curious" wanting a demo.
Mar 16 20:18:17 <Iowan>	As I recall, a couple of Profs wanted to tell their classes
Mar 16 20:18:35 <gringochapin>	Good point.  I'll hit up my profs as well.
Mar 16 20:18:45 <Iowan>	I plan to bring "some" computers to install - I suppose a CD would be handy, too
Mar 16 20:19:13 <F0o>	are the locations set in stone yet
Mar 16 20:19:54 <Iowan>	No - but at least the clay is drying nicely
Mar 16 20:20:02 <gringochapin>	Iowa City is.  IC public library, room E 1:00-6:00 on Saturday the 27th.
Mar 16 20:20:27 <gringochapin>	Show up at 12:30 if so inclined to help setup.
Mar 16 20:20:38 <F0o>	that  sounds set, i like
Mar 16 20:20:52 <gringochapin>	Room E is on the second floor.
Mar 16 20:21:23 <gringochapin>	In the event of an overflow, we can spill out into the library proper.
Mar 16 20:22:05 <Infl8ableSoulm8>	so all 1U machines in the actually room... :D
Mar 16 20:22:28 <Infl8ableSoulm8>	s/actually/actual/
Mar 16 20:23:14 <gringochapin>	Not sure what you're asking. Sorry.
Mar 16 20:23:34 <Infl8ableSoulm8>	was more of a joke.
Mar 16 20:23:55 <Infl8ableSoulm8>	1U == loud, library == quiet
Mar 16 20:24:45 <gringochapin>	Awe. Gotcha.  :)  Yeah, we'll have to be quietish, and hopefully we won't overflow.
Mar 16 20:25:02 <gringochapin>	Sorry, a little slow tonight.
Mar 16 20:25:17 <Iowan>	Was gonna offer (OLD) Wireless router - but library already has wireless
Mar 16 20:25:40 <gringochapin>	Yeah, what we need now is a hub.
Mar 16 20:25:58 <gringochapin>	Or a bunch of 4 port routers that we can daisy-chaine
Mar 16 20:26:11 <Iowan>	Push/shove, I'll unhook this 8-port... or go buy another
Mar 16 20:26:38 <Iowan>	justification... 'ya know...
Mar 16 20:26:52 <Infl8ableSoulm8>	:D
Mar 16 20:26:56 <F0o>	i have 2 4 ports  can bring
Mar 16 20:27:14 <F0o>	unless the wifey is in labor that weekend
Mar 16 20:27:17 <Infl8ableSoulm8>	no one in IC has a 24-port switch?
Mar 16 20:27:47 <gringochapin>	I just have a 4-port.
Mar 16 20:27:53 <gringochapin>	router.
Mar 16 20:28:00 <Iowan>	I've one 8 and one 4
Mar 16 20:28:02 <gringochapin>	8 ports is more like it though. :)
Mar 16 20:28:25 <Iowan>	anybody got 'em on sale?
Mar 16 20:28:30 <Infl8ableSoulm8>	anyone have a null modem cable?
Mar 16 20:28:46 <Iowan>	9-pin?
Mar 16 20:28:51 <Infl8ableSoulm8>	yep
Mar 16 20:28:52 <gringochapin>	Could probably make one.
Mar 16 20:28:55 <gringochapin>	easy.
Mar 16 20:29:04 <Iowan>	got at least one at work
Mar 16 20:29:39 <Iowan>	Wonder if we need a wish-list page somewhere?
Mar 16 20:30:01 <Infl8ableSoulm8>	Well, if you are a travelling person, you can have this 24port 10/100 + 2port 1000 switch, but it's a managed deal and needs to be reset.
Mar 16 20:30:23 <F0o>	we had a list going
Mar 16 20:30:26 <Iowan>	I presume library's connection is 100?
Mar 16 20:30:53 <Infl8ableSoulm8>	I don't have a null modem cable.
Mar 16 20:30:59 <Infl8ableSoulm8>	so it's just sitting here.
Mar 16 20:31:15 <Infl8ableSoulm8>	been too lazy to cut a serial cable apart.
Mar 16 20:31:16 <gringochapin>	No idea... I in fact wasn't sure if we should count on getting a good connect from the lib, or if I should bring a local repo on my laptop.
Mar 16 20:31:43 <F0o>	i wouldnt count on a good connection
Mar 16 20:31:43 <gringochapin>	Yeah, last weeks meeting.
Mar 16 20:32:41 <gringochapin>	That's kinda' what I thought.  What repos should I archive?  Just Lucid i386 and amd64?
Mar 16 20:32:50 <gringochapin>	What about source?
Mar 16 20:33:20 <Iowan>	??? Dunno...
Mar 16 20:33:27 <F0o>	all 3 me thinks
Mar 16 20:33:32 <gringochapin>	Sorry, the last weeks meeting reference was in response to talking about the list that was started.
Mar 16 20:33:51 <F0o>	i have the list
Mar 16 20:34:33 <F0o>	anyone actually using lucid
Mar 16 20:34:48 <gringochapin>	I just thought that if someone wanted to grab a source package they could do so via the regular repos, as there probably won't be much of that.  And even if there is, they will probably only want a few packages at most.
Mar 16 20:35:20 <Iowan>	AtomicSpark reported on Lucid - dunno if he's running it...
Mar 16 20:35:23 <gringochapin>	I was tempted to update my VM today, if that counts.  Haven't done so yet though.
Mar 16 20:36:01 <F0o>	i laid down a fresh vm a few weeks back,
Mar 16 20:36:09 <Iowan>	5 hours may blow by in a flash... sounds like fun!
Mar 16 20:36:18 <gringochapin>	For sure!
Mar 16 20:36:41 <F0o>	should be good
Mar 16 20:36:50 <gringochapin>	Can we get that list on the wiki, and maybe set it up like a sign up sheet, so we know whose bringing what?
Mar 16 20:37:06 <F0o>	i can give the list to whomever wants it
Mar 16 20:37:33 <Iowan>	Yup - set up a sub page for Events (or paste it into the Jam event)
Mar 16 20:37:57 <gringochapin>	Infl8ableSoulm8: what's involved in reseting the switch?  Are we talking paperclip, or JTAG? Something in between?
Mar 16 20:38:00 <Iowan>	Could set up a blueprint - but probably not enough time
Mar 16 20:39:13 <Infl8ableSoulm8>	gringochapin: keyboard combination during switch boot.
Mar 16 20:39:18 <gringochapin>	Probably fine to just put it in our event page... no need for a subpage.
Mar 16 20:39:19 <Infl8ableSoulm8>	via serial
Mar 16 20:40:44 <Infl8ableSoulm8>	after that, same concept as a cico catalyst switch.
Mar 16 20:40:55 <Infl8ableSoulm8>	s/cico/cisco/
Mar 16 20:41:29 <Infl8ableSoulm8>	all you're really have to do would be to set up the web interface ip, then you could do it the easy way for a simple setup.
Mar 16 20:41:48 <Infl8ableSoulm8>	might not even have to really do anything... I don't really know what the default settings are.
Mar 16 20:42:09 <gringochapin>	Hmmm... ok.  Thanks for the offer.  I'll see if I can even make it down there.  I'll get back to you in other words.
Mar 16 20:42:17 <gringochapin>	Unless someone else wants to take it on.
Mar 16 20:42:54 <Iowan>	Where is "down there"?
Mar 16 20:42:56 <Infl8ableSoulm8>	k
Mar 16 20:43:03 <Infl8ableSoulm8>	Des Moines
Mar 16 20:43:36 <Iowan>	I'm kinda hoping you'll need it there, but...
Mar 16 20:44:45 <F0o>	who's planning to go to the des moines one
Mar 16 20:45:03 <Iowan>	sidenote - XChat has all these colors, but everyone is in a shade of green...
Mar 16 20:46:00 <Iowan>	DM is still ??? Dunno if we have a site yet
Mar 16 20:46:23 <F0o>	simpson college sounds still up in the air
Mar 16 20:48:26 <gringochapin>	That's my understanding.
Mar 16 20:48:34 <gringochapin>	Or at least that's the last I've heard.
Mar 16 20:48:52 <Infl8ableSoulm8>	simpson would be neat.
Mar 16 20:49:02 <gringochapin>	Oh yeah, so there are only a few plugs in there, so we'll need to deal with that at well.
Mar 16 20:49:05 <Infl8ableSoulm8>	I work in indianola
Mar 16 20:49:09 <Iowan>	Just checked the day's email - nothing new/absolute about DM
Mar 16 20:50:06 <F0o>	dang dm is way closer
Mar 16 20:50:42 <Iowan>	Doesn't mean it won't happen - just no news...
Mar 16 20:51:08 <F0o>	theirs isnt really any dm people for it i dont think
Mar 16 20:51:24 *	Amaranth (~travis@ubuntu/member/Amaranth) has joined #ubuntu-us-ia
Mar 16 20:52:13 <Iowan>	Sounds like at least 4...
Mar 16 20:52:20 <gringochapin>	There are a few folks interested in DM.
Mar 16 20:57:21 <gringochapin>	So, in the interest of keeping things moving, what else needs to be decided, keeping in mind the fact that we have another mneeting planned for this Thursday?
Mar 16 20:57:43 <Iowan>	I was just thinking the same thing
Mar 16 20:58:30 <Iowan>	I'll try to get something started for wish-list page... unless someone beats me to it
Mar 16 20:58:44 <Iowan>	(probably not tonight)
Mar 16 20:59:57 <Iowan>	Anything else before we wrap it up?
Mar 16 21:00:10 <gringochapin>	Thanks.  I'll get the event posted on Craigslist, and I'll investigate other places to post it.
Mar 16 21:00:47 <Iowan>	Next meeting Thursday - same time, same channel
