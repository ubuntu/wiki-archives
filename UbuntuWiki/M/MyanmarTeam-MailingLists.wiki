== Ubuntu-MM mailing list ==

=== Official mailing list ===
In addition to <nowiki>[[MyanmarTeam-IRC|IRC channels]]</nowiki>, Ubuntu-MM uses a <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_mailing_list|mailing list]]</nowiki> as a primary form of communication.

You may subscribe to the ''ubuntu-l10n-my@lists.launchpad.net'' mailing list and view its archives <nowiki>[[http://lists.launchpad.net/ubuntu-l10n-my|here]]</nowiki>.

=== Alternative mailing list access ===

There are several alternate ways to browse and post to the list:
 
* <nowiki>[[http://groups.google.com/group/u4mm/| u4mm Google Groups]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[http://www.facebook.com/groups/ubuntu4mm/| Ubuntu Myanmar LoCo Facebook Group]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[http://lists.launchpad.net/ubuntu-l10n-my|The Mail Archive]]</nowiki>

If you post through these services, your messages will need to be approved by a moderator. The only way around this is to <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-l10n-my|subscribe to the list]]</nowiki> and post directly to ''ubuntu-l10n-my@lists.launchpad.net'' via e-mail from the same address that you used to subscribe.

These services offer a compromise between those who want a Web-based forum and those who don't wish to splinter the community into two camps. If you really '''must''' have a forum, there are the standard <nowiki>[[http://u4mm.com/|Ubuntu for Myanmar]]</nowiki>.

=== List Guidelines ===

While on the Ubuntu-MM mailing list, you are expected to abide by the <nowiki>[[http://ubuntu.com/community/conduct|Ubuntu Code of Conduct]]</nowiki> (CoC). Most of what is applicable to the mailing list can be summarised as follows (taken from <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/community/conduct|ubuntu.com]]</nowiki>):

 '''''Be respectful.''' The Ubuntu community and its members treat one another with respect. Everyone can make a valuable contribution to Ubuntu. We may not always agree, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behaviour and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It's important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. We expect members of the Ubuntu community to be respectful when dealing with other contributors as well as with people outside the Ubuntu project, and with users of Ubuntu.''
