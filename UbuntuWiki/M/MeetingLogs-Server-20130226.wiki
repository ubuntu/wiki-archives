It was decided not to send an alpha-2 call for testing, but to wait for beta instead.
Daviey mentioned that matsurba has kindly offered to help with dep-8 tests.

===== Raring Development =====

Daviey thinks we look a little further behind than we actually are, and asks that
everyone take a look to make sure their blueprints are uptodate.  If you'd like
to mark some items postponed, please first talk to Daviey, jamespage or smoser.

===== Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (plars) =====

plars will be taking hggdh's place representing QA.

plars noted that conffile failures no longer raise individual bugs, but rather are reported at https://jenkins.qa.ubuntu.com/view/Raring/view/Smoke%20Testing/job/raring-upgrade-quantal-server/ARCH=amd64,LTS=non-lts,PROFILE=server-tasks,label=upgrade-test/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/results/obsolete_conffiles.log

smb re-advertised  http://people.canonical.com/~smb/lucid-ec2-ng/

10:10 < hallyn> so that'll end up in the pkg before long?
10:10 < hallyn> will assume so.  bug 1064527 - roaksoax ?
10:10 < smoser> i'd hope we'll get something in raring... but most focus on maas has been on backport.

10:18 < Daviey> Make sure they are accurate, we look a little behind where i think we actually *are*
10:18 < Daviey> So everybody should check that bluepritns assigned to them are in accurate state
10:19 < Daviey> (and talk with elither myself, or jamespage or smoser about defering thing)
10:19 < hallyn> Daviey: meaning at this point we should talk to you before deferring anything,
10:19 < hallyn> or ping you if we have questions?
10:20 < Daviey> yeah.. ideally not just defer things.. disucss with me, or scott or james.. first

10:21 < hallyn> three cheers for hggdh ?
10:22 < hallyn> plars: 
10:22 < plars> Hi
10:22 < hallyn> hey :)
10:22 < plars> Just a couple of things
10:22 < plars> 1. LXC failures
10:22 < plars> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-test-cases/+bug/1130029
10:22 < ubottu> Ubuntu bug 1130029 in Ubuntu Test Cases "testcase: test_lxc_api returns error in raring lxc server smoke tests" [High,Confirmed]
10:23 < plars> hallyn: you seem to have a mp for this at https://code.launchpad.net/~serge-hallyn/ubuntu-test-cases/server-lxc2/+merge/150491
10:23 < hallyn> merge proposal is pending to fix that
10:23 < hallyn> yup
10:23 < hallyn> (though i'm still getting the hang of utah, still testing locally, might have more changes coming)
10:23 < plars> If someone can get that reviewed and in soon, we'd like to test it out.  I was talking to psivaa this morning about it and he thinks there may be other issues lurking once we get past this one
10:24 < hallyn> plars: who has the rights to review that?
10:24 < plars> I'm not as well aware of what's going on with this bug, so if he or you want to discuss what further steps might be needed, that would be useful
10:24 < plars> hallyn: it seems to be pointed at https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-server-dev right now
10:24 < hallyn> ?
10:25 < hallyn> ok will fix that, thanks :)
10:25 < plars> but as far as merging it, anyone in the https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-test-case-dev group could do it
10:25 < hallyn> no here it says lp:ubuntu-test-cases/server
10:25 -!- carif [~mcarifio@eth3.bismuth.canonical.com] has quit [Quit: Ex-Chat]
10:25 < hallyn> oh you mean reviewer
10:25 < plars> hallyn: I'm talking about the reviewer
10:25 < plars> right
10:25 < hallyn> i just used the default
10:26 < plars> ubuntu-server-dev is the default reviewer?
10:26 < plars> odd
10:26 < hallyn> is that something that should be changed in the ubuntu-test-case lp settings?
10:26 < plars> perhaps
10:26 -!- lalatenduM [~lalatendu@122.166.163.146] has quit [Ping timeout: 255 seconds]
10:26 < plars> I'll talk to others about it, but since it's a test for lxc, I figured it was something that you wanted reviewed by ubuntu-server-dev
10:26 < hallyn> ok thanks we'll straighten the mp out - moving on?
10:26 < plars> it made sense to me at least
10:26 < plars> ok
10:26 < hallyn> oh i see, ok
10:26 < plars> only other thing I wanted to raise (and it's minor) is conffile failures
10:26 < hallyn> no perhaps ubuntu-lxc
10:26 < plars> ex. https://jenkins.qa.ubuntu.com/view/Raring/view/Smoke%20Testing/job/raring-upgrade-quantal-server/ARCH=amd64,LTS=non-lts,PROFILE=server-tasks,label=upgrade-test/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/results/obsolete_conffiles.log
10:27 < hallyn> not ubuntu-server-dev
10:27 < plars> These are no longer reported as individual bugs
10:27 < plars> but we get a good log of them in the test runs that can be referred to
10:27 -!- noy [~Noy@wesnoth/developer/noy] has joined #ubuntu-meeting
10:28 < plars> We realize that they are low priority as bugs go, and in some cases they stack up to dozens that would need to be tracked against every daily test run indefinitely.  So if you have some cycles and want to clean them up, it would be useful
10:28 < hallyn> these are confiles no longer used by cups in raring?  
10:28 < plars> apparently not
10:28 < plars> or if they are, their location changed
10:29 -!- freeflying [~freeflyin@114.244.250.186] has joined #ubuntu-meeting
10:29 < hallyn> and so they should be handled by the packaging somehow.  k.  does someone go look at those log pages regularly?
10:29 < hallyn> do they get emailed somewhere?
10:30 < plars> hallyn: not currently, but they always end up in the same place, so they are pretty easy to find
10:30 < plars> hallyn: the url I pointed to will take you to the lastSuccessfulBuild in jenkins and show you the current obsolete_conffiles log
10:30 < hallyn> perhaps that url s hould be added to the server team knowledgebase weekly bug triaging section
10:31 < hallyn> the url may be consistent, but if noone is in the habit of looking at it, bugs won't get raised...  course you're right about low prio,
10:31 < plars> hallyn: that sounds reasonable - we were looking for a better way of dealing with these and nobody wanted spam about it, but I don't think it makes sense to ignore them entirely. So just making you aware
10:31 < hallyn> ok, thanks
10:31 < hallyn> #action serge consider putting the obsolete_conffiles.log url in weekly triaging knowledgebase section
10:31 < meetingology> ACTION: serge consider putting the obsolete_conffiles.log url in weekly triaging knowledgebase section
10:31 < plars> hallyn: the problem with bugs is it got to be quite a lot of overhead - in this case with one or 2 it's not so bad, but in others you're talking 30-40 bugs that have to be updated across each daily test run
10:32 < plars> ...for something that just gets ignored
10:32 < plars> sanity kicked in at some point
10:32 < hallyn> plars: yup :)
10:32 < plars> that's all from me
10:32 < hallyn> plars: thanks

10:32 < smb> Hello, I would like to take this opportunity to re-advertise for http://people.canonical.com/~smb/lucid-ec2-ng/ ... I know not very subtly but I am a developer and not a sales guy. :-P Otherwise raring kernel ddebs will be actually usable after next upload (in case anybody actually was wondering why the heck they were so small).
10:32 < smb> Oh, one other thing: have not run into this myself but it seems
10:32 < smb> that recent raring kvm/qemu packages are a bit insulted if
10:32 < smb> post-install does not get /dev/kvm. This might not be the "normal"
10:32 < smb> case but it is possible to have the kvm package installed and dual
10:32 < smb> boot between xen and non-xen mode and its also possibleto do a
10:32 < smb> dist-upgrade in xen dom0 which won't allow for /dev/kvm...
10:33 < smb> Beside that, any questions? :)
10:33 < smoser> smb, i'm confused about /dev/kvm
10:33 < hallyn> smb: the /dev/kvm bit *should* be fixed, please shout at me if you see it again
10:33 < smoser> right.
10:33 < smb> hallyn, Ah ok, it was a few days ago
10:34 < smoser> hallyn, that is bug 1103022 ?

10:34 < hallyn> smoser: no
10:34 < hallyn> smoser: it was a bug from my bad fixing of that one
10:34 < hallyn> smoser: if /dev/kvm did not exist, getfacl failed, causing postinst to fail
10:34 < smoser> ah. k.
10:34 < smb> Ah ok, as said it wasn't me and it was probably last week
10:35 < hallyn> smb: feb 20 the fix went up
10:35 < hallyn> so yeah shout at me if you see it again.  thx
10:36 < hallyn> lucid-ec2-ng - i assume the right folks know what that means :)
10:36 < smb> hallyn, sure. will do :)
