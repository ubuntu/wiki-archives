I love to think something totally different. I trained my brain to do so since 2000 and that was a very long journey. I noticed most people considered as linux GURU in malaysia have a trend to blog about linux in a very complicated way. Thats why most of the articles in my blog is so easy to understand even if you are not IT related person. I love to share my knowledge with others and at the same time i love to blog. I found a lot of interesting people when i became ubuntu blogger. I hope to find a lot more interesting people and make friend with them when i officially become ubuntu member.
