i've Converted 500+ People To ubuntu Through my Events.
i'm supporting Graduation Projects (Computer science, Computer Engineering, Communication Engineering). i used to convert Students to use UBUNTU instead.
I'm the Founder of Qoudra, Tech. Provider Company which is Specialized in Mobile And Embedded Systems. We Use Ubuntu, All Employees are using UBUNTU. and the one who don't know, we teach HIM :)
we built small systems (using BOX PCs and mini PCs) using UBUNTU 

furthermore. a complete company has switched to Ubuntu Servers and ubuntu laptops. the complete cast (developers,designers, marketers, Call Center Agents, Business Developers, and the CEO) i've given a free training and support for them when they have just switched to make sure that UBUNTU fulfilled their needs and they will never go back. and they are working on UBUNTU for more than 1 year :)

=== Future Goals ===

i wish to spread Ubuntu more through it's official channel. increase the awareness among the egyptian community about ubuntu. 

i wish also to prepare Online video Campaigns for non-technical people to tell them that ubuntu is not only for Engineers and developers. but, it's for human beings ..
