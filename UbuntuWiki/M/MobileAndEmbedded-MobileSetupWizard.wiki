== What is Mobile Setup Wizard? ==
 First time setup
 Current OEM config is similar to what this is.
 
 Do we want a new app or can we extend About Me?
 
 About Me might be enough, with extensions, although About Me currently seems to just have text fields not connected to anything

 For netbook OEM config might be enough, or extended to meet needs.
 
 Such an applet may gather and autopopulate into apps as appropriate the following:
* email data
* Instant Message info
* personal data, this might be integrated into Contacts
* user picture (through webcam)
* possibly locale, although for custom that may be an oem level pre-config
** For arbitrary, user-supplied devices, this ought be part of the installer, rather than oem-config
* time zone (this could perhaps be automated via GSM/GPS)
* wifi access point/password -- Why? That might change a lot
** This ought be maneged by
* Use the various google/yahoo/etc apis to automatically retrieve user info

* Demo device features
** Accelerometer
** GPS
