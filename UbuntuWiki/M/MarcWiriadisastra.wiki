__TOC__

This page is basically just going to have a bit of information relating to ubuntu that I have found in my short time.  
<<BR>>I will try and make it as concise as possible and if there is any issues please contact me.  I am currently learning how to package hopefully once my experience gets up I will contribute to <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MOTU|MOTU]]</nowiki>.

=== Packages ===
I have created a page on my local 512/128 connection server so its slow as buggery.
<<BR>>The link is: http://www.smlintl.com.au/packages This will have a list of current packages currently only <nowiki>[[http://rufus.sourceforge.net|Rufus]]</nowiki> has been created

If there are issues please advise me and I'll try and fix them as soon as possible.

* *Edit There are severe issues at the moment.  The 3rd version works however I need to remove some dll's I've been told as well as there are other issues with it.  I will post when a complete working version is in place.
