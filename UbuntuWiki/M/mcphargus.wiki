It all started at Phreaknic 9. I was zoned out in front of my Mac as a party roared around me. Somebody threw something at my keyboard. 

Ready to punch the mother in the mouth, I looked down to hurl it back but noticed it was just a CD.

Having calmed down I looked for the joker to ask him what it was and by the time I looked up he (or she, I still don't know) had walked out of the room.

The CD was a Warty Warthog CD for PPC. When I sobered up and popped that little orange disc in my mac, my life changed forever...

Wherever you are dude (or dudine), thanks.

Since that fateful day, my obsession with the free software movement has been downright frightening. My friends all say I need help, my parents have told me to stop turning down gainful employment opportunities from proprietary-software-only shops, and any participation in activities not directly related to promoting free software (in hostile environments only, as time and financial constraints have kept me from IT conferences that in turn promote the furtherance of open technologies) have all gone the way of the punch-card programmer. Back in the day it was yogurt and long walks on the beach, now it's Blender and lengthy whitepapers about why ITT Tech and other schools should be teaching more in the way of FLOSS and the GNU Lifestyle.

Maybe I should trade my computer in for a new girlfriend, but I guess I'm just not ready to take the downgrade.
