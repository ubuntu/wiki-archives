<<BR>> (07:28:08 PM) guinea-pig: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MassachusettsTeam/Meetings/Agenda
<<BR>> (07:28:37 PM) maccam94: guinea-pig: yeah thanks, i should check the wiki more often >_<
<<BR>> (07:28:42 PM) MissNotes: Umm...I think we are going to go over the last installfest as to what we need to change from the last one....
<<BR>> (07:29:28 PM) guinea-pig: first idea
<<BR>> (07:29:31 PM) maccam94: maybe organize a "tour trail"
<<BR>> (07:29:34 PM) guinea-pig: we hafve some ubutntu custom keyboards
<<BR>> (07:29:43 PM) guinea-pig: let's work out a plan to give them away
<<BR>> (07:29:44 PM) maccam94: or organize the stations in some sort of order...?
<<BR>> (07:29:51 PM) MissNotes: Lefty is showing us one of the few Zareson keyboards...with ubuntu keys
<<BR>> (07:29:58 PM) maccam94: oooooh cool
<<BR>> (07:30:47 PM) MissNotes: First order of buisness....how are we going to give away the 4 we bought?
<<BR>> (07:31:02 PM) shardz: You could do 4 for me?
<<BR>> (07:31:13 PM) shardz: We could raffle them away if you think that's a good idea.
<<BR>> (07:31:26 PM) maccam94: raising funds *is* a plus....
<<BR>> (07:31:42 PM) shardz: True. But they said "give away"
<<BR>> (07:31:58 PM) shardz: Perhaps they go to the first 4 donators?
<<BR>> (07:32:08 PM) maccam94: still not giving away
<<BR>> (07:32:10 PM) maccam94: um
<<BR>> (07:33:02 PM) ubuntu-ma-screen [i=steve@ilo.staticfree.info] entered the room.
<<BR>> (07:33:21 PM) MissNotes: We could 1. Sell them, 2. Raffle? (People come and go) 3. ??
<<BR>> (07:33:28 PM) maccam94: maybe make some sort of contest or game...?
<<BR>> (07:33:45 PM) shardz: We could see who could do the quickest install?
<<BR>> (07:33:54 PM) shardz: Naw, ubuntu isn't really that flexible about installtime.
<<BR>> (07:34:21 PM) maccam94: yeah, it's highly dependent on how good the computer is
<<BR>> (07:34:38 PM) shardz: Mine was a bad idea. Don't entertain it.
<<BR>> (07:34:59 PM) maccam94: MissNotes: anyone come up with any good ideas at the actual meeting?
<<BR>> (07:35:16 PM) ***shardz waves
<<BR>> (07:35:19 PM) MissNotes: We kidna are skipping around
<<BR>> (07:35:32 PM) maccam94: grrr
<<BR>> (07:35:43 PM) maccam94: MissNotes: is this meeting being held at the location of the installfest?
<<BR>> (07:35:50 PM) MissNotes: Yes
<<BR>> (07:35:58 PM) guinea-pig: ... different floor
<<BR>> (07:36:10 PM) xavier: we're in a meeting room. the installfest is in a common area.
<<BR>> (07:36:28 PM) maccam94: ok, well people should draw out a floorplan as to what sort of table layout we'll have, where cords will run, etc
<<BR>> (07:36:46 PM) shardz: Last time I believe we just made it up in the first hour and that went very well?
<<BR>> (07:36:49 PM) maccam94: and being in the room when doing that can be very helpful
<<BR>> (07:36:52 PM) MissNotes: Martin is talking about the installfest at Mel King's "South End Technology Center" 
<<BR>> (07:37:00 PM) maccam94: shardz: ehh it could have een better
<<BR>> (07:37:02 PM) maccam94: MissNotes: k
<<BR>> (07:37:21 PM) shardz: Personally I would prefer to have it at the MIT Media Lab's Lower Atrium. I thought that location was perfect.
<<BR>> (07:37:37 PM) xavier: that's where it will be.
<<BR>> (07:37:40 PM) xavier: this time.
<<BR>> (07:37:43 PM) shardz: Okay.
<<BR>> (07:39:10 PM) shardz: We should have a code-off for the keyboards.
<<BR>> (07:39:24 PM) maccam94: no
<<BR>> (07:39:29 PM) maccam94: lol
<<BR>> (07:39:35 PM) MissNotes: Ok, we are working on the floor plan...But, we are thinking the tape instead of planning the floorplan
<<BR>> (07:39:52 PM) maccam94: MissNotes: what do you mean?
<<BR>> (07:40:02 PM) MissNotes: We are doing PR First, then then the planning
<<BR>> (07:40:22 PM) shardz: http://www.monzy.com/?p=18 <-- "Code Fight"
<<BR>> (07:40:50 PM) shardz: How well did the big sign work last time? It seems like we got a lot of people off the street.
<<BR>> (07:40:59 PM) guinea-pig: the banner?
<<BR>> (07:41:17 PM) shardz: Yes, we had a large Linux banner out front.
<<BR>> (07:41:25 PM) leftyfb: we'll be using it again
<<BR>> (07:41:29 PM) leftyfb: it worked pretty good
<<BR>> (07:41:42 PM) leftyfb: not as big as I thought it was going to be .. or at least in proportion to where we put it
<<BR>> (07:41:54 PM) shardz: http://gallery.ubuntu-ma.us/?g2_itemId=87
<<BR>> (07:42:01 PM) leftyfb: we're trying to come up with names for the installfest
<<BR>> (07:42:02 PM) MissNotes: We are going to make a list of names that we can choose for the installfest...
<<BR>> (07:42:19 PM) guinea-pig: a better term than just "installfest" as that doesn't necessarily explain what it is
<<BR>> (07:42:22 PM) shardz: Are we gonna keep the ubuntu release naming scheme? An alliteration and an animal?
<<BR>> (07:42:29 PM) MissNotes: Ubuntupalooza, ubuntuparty, The UP, 
<<BR>> (07:42:42 PM) shardz: hahahaha ubuntupalooza
<<BR>> (07:43:04 PM) MissNotes: "free as in beer fest"
<<BR>> (07:43:11 PM) Earl_of_Dunham: free as in beerfest
<<BR>> (07:43:21 PM) Earl_of_Dunham: ubuntu orgy
<<BR>> (07:43:26 PM) shardz: I think we'll get some college students looking for free beer with that one.
<<BR>> (07:43:33 PM) Earl_of_Dunham: ubuntu-a-ton
<<BR>> (07:43:36 PM) shardz: I'm pretty sure my parents wont let me go to the ubuntu orgy.
<<BR>> (07:43:41 PM) MissNotes: Ubuntu-a--thon
<<BR>> (07:43:41 PM) Earl_of_Dunham: ubuntu-a-thon
<<BR>> (07:43:54 PM) guinea-pig: ubunt-a-thon
<<BR>> (07:43:55 PM) Earl_of_Dunham: ubuorgy
<<BR>> (07:44:17 PM) shardz: We just need to throw this[1] picture all over the place, people will go.
<<BR>> (07:44:21 PM) shardz: [1] = http://gallery.ubuntu-ma.us/?g2_itemId=90
<<BR>> (07:44:30 PM) MissNotes: UBUNTU 08
<<BR>> (07:44:46 PM) shardz: Better do something like Ubuntu 08.0
<<BR>> (07:44:51 PM) guinea-pig: 08.4
<<BR>> (07:44:54 PM) shardz: Since don't we have these... every so often?
<<BR>> (07:45:00 PM) guinea-pig: or ... 08.2 as it were
<<BR>> (07:45:03 PM) shardz: 08.2?
<<BR>> (07:45:12 PM) MissNotes: Replace your windows with Ubuntu!
<<BR>> (07:45:14 PM) shardz: I missed two installfests this month?
<<BR>> (07:45:15 PM) Earl_of_Dunham: Ubuntu Linuxfest
<<BR>> (07:45:27 PM) shardz: My totally original idea:
<<BR>> (07:45:29 PM) shardz: Ubuntu Tag
<<BR>> (07:47:00 PM) shardz: Any good ideas coming from the live people?
<<BR>> (07:47:02 PM) MissNotes: On the old flyer, we are missing "a paragraph about what we do, "Free windows alternative", 
<<BR>> (07:47:24 PM) shardz: I would say linux is more than a 'free windows alternative'
<<BR>> (07:47:40 PM) Earl_of_Dunham: FREE STUFF!!!!
<<BR>> (07:47:57 PM) maccam94: shardz: don't bother with semantics for windows users :-P lots of them are confused enough already
<<BR>> (07:48:04 PM) MissNotes: Installfest...or 
<<BR>> (07:48:04 PM) shardz: heh
<<BR>> (07:48:12 PM) shardz: I think installfest is the best name so far.
<<BR>> (07:48:17 PM) maccam94: (not to make generalizations >_< )
<<BR>> (07:48:28 PM) shardz: It's a fest, where the focus is to install linux.
<<BR>> (07:48:33 PM) shardz: I guess you could call it the "ubuntufest"
<<BR>> (07:48:35 PM) MissNotes: "FREE STUFF" the paragraph should read, Bring, your computer and we will replace that with a free operating system...a paragraph...
<<BR>> (07:48:52 PM) maccam94: MissNotes: maybe not installfest, but more demonstration? most people are afraid to get things installed right away...
<<BR>> (07:49:14 PM) shardz: I don't support the name demofest, btw. Last time we had a demo computer, correct?
<<BR>> (07:49:28 PM) leftyfb: we had a few
<<BR>> (07:49:55 PM) shardz: Right. I remember quite a few people were very impressed.
<<BR>> (07:50:07 PM) shardz: Infact someone dumped some guy on me and had me explain stuff. :D
<<BR>> (07:50:09 PM) MissNotes: *****PR Will have a new poster to put up tomorrow for us...***Will recieve though mailing list, and we can all decide if it's great or not, if not, send ideas to fix, or post if you like them.....THANKS
<<BR>> (07:50:30 PM) shardz: Sounds good. I believe that's what we did last time?
<<BR>> (07:50:44 PM) xavier: {{https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MassachusettsTeam/Events/InstallFests/2008-04-12?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=installfest_floor_layout.png}}
<<BR>> (07:50:48 PM) xavier: That's the floor layout.
<<BR>> (07:50:50 PM) guinea-pig: discussing the waiver at the moment
<<BR>> (07:51:39 PM) shardz: Do you want me to throw tables in that image?
<<BR>> (07:51:44 PM) MissNotes: Changing the waiver form to say "Boston User Group" not "Victoria user Group"
<<BR>> (07:51:51 PM) shardz: hahahahaha
<<BR>> (07:51:54 PM) xavier: shardz: I don't know the proper scale, otherwise I would have.
<<BR>> (07:51:55 PM) guinea-pig: do you remember where outlets and the ethernet drop was?
<<BR>> (07:52:00 PM) MissNotes: Next Item of buisness...
<<BR>> (07:52:10 PM) shardz: I remember there was a table with a large switch.
<<BR>> (07:52:18 PM) xavier: guinea-pig: yeah. The ethernet drop is where the "tel" icon is.
<<BR>> (07:52:20 PM) shardz: I remember where one of the outlets was, that's it.
<<BR>> (07:52:31 PM) guinea-pig: xavier: *i* remember. i was asking shardz
<<BR>> (07:52:57 PM) shardz: It's probably better if someone who's not about to go do family stuff tables-up this image.
<<BR>> (07:53:15 PM) shardz: guinea-pig: aside, bring fluxx again :D
<<BR>> (07:53:27 PM) MissNotes: *************Name, Where they heard from installfest, and e-mail address*********For sign in sheet
<<BR>> (07:53:32 PM) guinea-pig: did we only have round tables available, besides the two rectangular?
<<BR>> (07:53:33 PM) xavier: shardz: again, I don't have the scale.
<<BR>> (07:53:34 PM) guinea-pig: shardz: duh
<<BR>> (07:53:53 PM) shardz: xavier: oh, wow, yeah, didn't see that the first time.
<<BR>> (07:56:03 PM) MissNotes: Our goal of the installfest... *******Educate, inform, install, fix issues, teach, and promote*******
<<BR>> (07:56:06 PM) xavier: guinea-pig: we had 2 rectangular plus infinite round.
<<BR>> (07:57:38 PM) maccam94: note how install is only 1 of the 6 things...
<<BR>> (07:58:01 PM) Earl_of_Dunham: ducate == teach
<<BR>> (07:58:07 PM) Earl_of_Dunham: educate == teach
<<BR>> (07:58:13 PM) guinea-pig: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MassachusettsTeam/Toolbox/WindowsAlternativesFlyer
<<BR>> (07:58:34 PM) MissNotes: ***we need to edit the ubuntu alternatives*** Remove Gaim, and just have pidgen
<<BR>> (07:58:43 PM) maccam94: *pidgin
<<BR>> (07:59:26 PM) MissNotes: **Key signing for the internal group, not other people**
<<BR>> (08:00:03 PM) guinea-pig: does anyone know where to find aptana easily, or should we remove that from the alternatives flyer?
<<BR>> (08:00:11 PM) guinea-pig: it's not in multiverse/universe
<<BR>> (08:00:23 PM) maccam94: http://www.howtoforge.com/aptana_ajax_ide_ubuntu
<<BR>> (08:00:59 PM) MissNotes: An agenda on the poster...

<<BR>> (08:03:12 PM) maccam94: etc
<<BR>> (08:03:18 PM) guinea-pig: maccam94: can we work on packaging this for ubuntu at our packaging jam (or something?)
<<BR>> (08:03:30 PM) MissNotes: We want "demo Stations" that are deticated to demo on.
<<BR>> (08:04:17 PM) maccam94: guinea-pig: aptana? the trick is that it requires individual registration for trial keys
<<BR>> (08:04:25 PM) guinea-pig: oh. really
<<BR>> (08:04:26 PM) maccam94: but i'm sure we can package the .zip for people too
<<BR>> (08:04:44 PM) guinea-pig: so it's a bit... proprietary? :P
<<BR>> (08:05:01 PM) maccam94: it's open source
<<BR>> (08:05:10 PM) maccam94: idk i just found the link when someone asked
<<BR>> (08:05:28 PM) maccam94: oh wait

<<BR>> (08:08:12 PM) maccam94: how about security/stability?
<<BR>> (08:08:46 PM) maccam94: you don't need to run virus and spyware scans ;-)
<<BR>> (08:08:50 PM) xavier: that's a good one.
<<BR>> (08:09:10 PM) MissNotes: 4. you don't need to run virus and spyware scans
<<BR>> (08:09:15 PM) maccam94: maybe we should have "Fun Facts"
<<BR>> (08:09:29 PM) maccam94: and list what major organizations currently use Linux
<<BR>> (08:11:53 PM) Earl_of_Dunham: Vrgin Airlines,Google, Banco de Brasil...
