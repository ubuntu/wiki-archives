'''about me...'''

Hi,

I was born in 1990. I am a very gentle and quiet person.
I grew up with the Operating Systems Microsoft Windows 95 and Windows 98, and in research to find out how to work my machine (hardware , software) I became aware of Ubuntu 07.10. From there I began my encounter with the penguin.

Over the years I have cultivated my passion especially as a systems engineer (I love find and fix errors , configure programs or settings to get the best). I attended the High School and I'm currently following the course of Computer Science at the University of Padua.

I like to make videos from the manipulation of images up to the video montages.

I am a reserved guy but very willing to learn new things and I like to have a new challenge.
