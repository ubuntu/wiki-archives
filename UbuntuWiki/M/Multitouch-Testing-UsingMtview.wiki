__TOC__

mtview is a visual feedback tool that shows touch points, sizes, disconnects, offsets, etc.

=== Install Binary ===

If you don't need to work with the source code, this is the easiest way to get started with <code>mtview</code> :-) (note that it's currently available only in the Natty archives as a binary install):
<pre>
 $ sudo apt-get install mtview
</pre>

=== Build from Source ===

If you need more than the binary, here's how to get the code and build it:
<pre>
 $ bzr branch lp:mtview
</pre>
This code is a mirror of a git master branch, maintained by Henrik Rydberg here:
<pre>
 $ git clone http://bitmath.org/git/mtview.git
</pre>

Due note, however, that patches, merge proposes, bugs, etc., need to be filed against the LP code!

Once you have the code, you can build:
<pre>
 $ cd mtview
 $ ./autogen.sh
 $ ./configure
 $ make
</pre>

=== Testing the Device ===

In order to run <code>mtview</code>, you will need to know the input node for your multitouch device. To find this out, use the instructions here:
  <nowiki>[[Multitouch-Testing-CheckingMTDevice]]</nowiki>

Let's say that after running <code>lsinput</code>, you discovered that your MT device input node was <code>/dev/input/event10</code>, then you would run mtview with the following command:
<pre>
sudo ./bin/mtview /dev/input/event10
</pre>

At this point, a window will come up and <code>mtview</code> will capture all touch events. Some examples of <code>mtview</code> in action can be found here:
* http://bitmath.org/code/mtview/collection.php
* http://www.flickr.com/photos/oubiwann/tags/mtview/

Some known issues with <code>mtview</code> to keep in mind:
* sometimes the screen starts up with a black background, sometimes with a white one
* the first touch is not captured
* around the edges of the screen, touch points are offset; this is a bug, and not (necessarily) a problem with your hardware
