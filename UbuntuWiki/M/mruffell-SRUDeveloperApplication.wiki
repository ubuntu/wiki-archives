I am applying because:

* I would like to eliminate delays in getting my work sponsored, making delivering fixes faster.
* I would like to provide sponsorship coverage for the APAC region, and help my APAC colleagues in Sustaining Engineering get their patches sponsored without having to rely on other geolocations.
* I would like to reduce the burden on my sponsors. I feel like I constantly burden Mauricio and Heitor with my patches, and while they do like reviewing them, not all my bugs are super interesting. I also heavily leaned on Eric and Dan in the past, and want to help spread the load.

== Who I am ==
I have been using computers ever since I was two or three years old, when my parents brought me a Macintosh IICX along with a Macintosh LCII shortly after. I was always fascinated by these machines, how word processors worked, floppy disk storage, and eventually this moved into binary hex editing in <nowiki>[[https://eclecticlight.co/2016/06/04/the-genius-of-mac-resedit-and-resources/ | ResEdit]]</nowiki>. System 7.5.5 was where it was at. These days one of my hobbies is collecting vintage Apple computers, and everyone I interview is greeted with my background of machines.

Later on my passion for computing grew, and I especially liked Computer Security, and started doing basic CTF competitions, which led me to enroll in a Computer Science degree at University. I worked hard, studying 80 hour weeks, but got straight A+ marks in every single Computer Science, Software Engineering and Computer Engineering course, with A/A+ average in the rest of my discrete Mathematics courses.

In my PhD Student years I would keep a keen interest in Security, doing CTFs and writing papers on Security and Privacy. I had a lot of time on my hands, and made my own Linux Distro called <nowiki>[[https://dapperlinux.com|Dapper Linux]]</nowiki>, which focuses on being highly secure, while trying not to hurt user experience too much. The features of Dapper Linux was a full grsecurity kernel with all options enabled, correct PAX flags for binaries, most graphical applications were sandboxes with Oz (seccomp containers with separate X server, with xrpa to join to host X server), then later on Flatpak. 

Dapper Linux taught me distro engineering, packaging, and when the grsecuirty patchset went private, I took over maintenance of it, which got me started headfirst into kernel development and maintaining a stable distro kernel, for the 4.9 series. I learned that distro engineering takes patience and grit, but was always very proud to be running my own distro on my computer, and would tell anyone who listened.

These days I have a keen interest in Reverse Engineering, Malware Analysis, Kernel Dev, and Security.

== My Ubuntu story ==
I was introduced to Ubuntu in 2007 by one of my good friends, who used Ubuntu on his desktop. He was using 7.04 with gnome2, will full compiz effects of cube and flaming windows. I was impressed, and intrigued that you could "apt install" any package you wished, and didn't need to download installers and run them.

From there I would run Ubuntu in VMs and play around, but I was still a Macintosh user at the time.

After Apple dropped support for my Macbook Pro 2,2 I decided to install Quantal in January 2013. From there I have been using Linux full time ever since, and I love installing the latest release every six months.

Late in my PhD Student days, I arrived to the conclusion that I didn't like academia, and wanted to contribute to the world. Dapper Linux had like 6 users at the time, and I wanted my work to have more impact, so I took my distro engineering experience and looked for a job. I happened to run into Trent at linux.conf.au where I was speaking about maintaining the grsecurity patchset, and he told me about opportunities in Sustaining Engineering.

Shortly after in March 2019, I was welcomed to Canonical as a member of SEG, and I have been digging into and fixing some quite complex customer bugs, some critical to the functioning of the core distro itself, or a high profile regression etc.

I love Linux, and I love Ubuntu, and especially like the community aspects of working on bugs, and seeing people happy to have their bugs fixed.

=== Areas of work ===
I mostly work on maintaining Stable Releases as part of my work on the Sustaining Engineering team. I work closely with customers to reproduce and root cause issues they experience in production, and then determine a fix, provide test packages and get patches sponsored and into -proposed for verification and eventual release.

My interests and duties are mostly split between Kernel and Server/userspace work. I work closely with my colleagues in the Sustaining Engineering team, like Mauricio, Heitor, Gerald and Jay. I have regular discussions with Security, and speak to Alex and Evan. The Kernel Team review a lot of my submissions, and Andrea, Tim, Stefan and Marcello are happy to reply.

=== Things I could do better ===
I have a lot of things going on on the backburner, and sometimes a particular bug goes a bit unloved for a few months while I work on higher priority things. One particular example of this is:
* gvfsd process does not have the KRB5CCNAME environment set
** https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/tracker-miners/+bug/1779890
My goal is to reduce the amount of these unloved bugs, and maybe try make progress on them each week, even if it is the smallest movement forward.

I also think I could be more active on community channels. When Canonical moved from IRC to Mattermost I stopped renewing my IRCCloud subscription, and fell off public IRC channels. I will try maintain a public presence from now on. I only got reminded of this during the Ubuntu Uploaders meeting in Riga.

=== Plans for the future ===
I plan to keep working on squashing tough bugs, to keep the user experience of Ubuntu as best as it can be. Working with my colleagues to debug tough issues, and giving them advice on Debian packaging and SRU requirements.

=== What I like least in Ubuntu ===
I think the series upgrade story needs some work. Each time I have release-upgraded in the past, something had broken to the point where it was a thorn in my side until I clean installed. I have clean installed every release since 12.10, since I just can't trust upgrades. I see customers experience the same level of pain, particularly with their OpenStack deployments, trying to go between OpenStack releases and distribution series to reach a new supported OpenStack release with feature X available. The only way around this is to get more testing coverage on upgrades, and when something breaks on upgrade, we need to sit down and fix it instead of clean install and forget. Maybe I try upgrade to Noble from Mantic this cycle, and see what happens.

==== General feedback ====
I worked with Matthew for several years in the Sustaining Engineering team, and he is a very smart engineer with close attention to detail and is able to pick up technical concepts very quickly. While he lives in the opposite timezone from me, so we rarely had much realtime interactions outside of sprints, I did work with him through the normal asynchronous channels and have sponsored 8 packages for him. In all cases where I had any questions or concerns, Matthew provided well thought-out replies and always handled all steps of the SRU process with care and adherance to the process.

I have full trust in Matthew to be an excellent member of the SRU developers team.

The specific list of sponsored packages is <nowiki>[[https://udd.debian.org/cgi-bin/ubuntu-sponsorships.cgi?render=html&sponsor=Dan+Streetman&sponsor_search=name&sponsoree=Matthew+Ruffell&sponsoree_search=name|here]]</nowiki>. For most of those, the SRU was done cleanly and I was able to upload without requesting any changes or clarification. I did have questions for some, for example <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/liburcu/+bug/1876230|this bug]]</nowiki> required some discussion among several people, and Matthew provided excellent responses and analysis throughout the process.

==== Areas of Improvement ====
I haven't worked with Matthew since I left Canonincal around a year ago, but the only area for improvement I know of from our previous time working together is that Matthew is probably taking too long to apply for higher acl in Ubuntu; I think he should have applied for SRU developer a few years ago :-)

==== General feedback ====
Matthew and I have worked together for a few years now in the Sustaining Engineering team, and he's a dedicated engineer with a good eye for details. He's eager to learn and asks very thoughtful questions, always being mindful of the bigger picture that goes beyond his individual SRU items. Whenever I had any questions about his uploads, Matthew was quick to address them with care.

I believe Matthew will be a great addition to the SRU developers team, and a great asset to the Ubuntu community in general.

For almost all of Matthew's uploads, the SRU was handled neatly and I didn't require any changes. Matthew and I handled more interesting corner cases such as <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/2020834|adsys bug 2020834]]</nowiki>, where he dedicated more time on testing and analysis due to other issues being uncovered during proposed testing.

==== Areas of Improvement ====
Matthew does excellent work on the technical side of SRUs, the only area of improvement I've seen is that he can sometimes let minor things slip (e.g. the use of 'backport' vs 'upstream' on DEP-3 headers). I do believe these are mostly one-off items that will improve as he continues working on his uploader experience, and shouldn't prevent him of continuing with his good work.

==== General feedback ====
I have had the pleasure of working with Matthew in the Sustaining Engineer Group (SEG) at Canonical for many years, where Matthew's expertise in identifying and resolving issues in stable releases significantly contributed to the overall success of the projects. Matthew is very serious, motivated and dedicated.

==== Areas of Improvement ====
It's been a couple of years since I last sponsored a debdiff from Matthew so areas of improvement that I have noted back then (which were only nitpicks) could have already improved since then. For that reason, I'll defer to other endorsers who recently worked with Matthew to identify them.

==== General feedback ====

Matthew and I have worked together in the Sustaining Engineering Group (SEG) team at Canonical for ~5 years now (2019/03/11). <<BR>>
I have always appreciated the quality, depth, and efficiency of his work -- in everything he picked up to do (he's very dedicated and attentive), that I know of. <<BR>>
He's one of my first go-to persons for that mix of difficult/complex/urgent problems.  
Well, other people learned that too, so he is often busy with high-priority or high-urgency work, which of course might cause some delay on other items, but again, he's one of the best I've seen, including the juggling tasks of all priorities.

I have <nowiki>[[https://udd.debian.org/cgi-bin/ubuntu-sponsorships.cgi?render=html&sponsor=Mauricio+Faria+de+Oliveira&sponsor_search=name&sponsoree=Matthew+Ruffell&sponsoree_search=name|sponsored]]</nowiki> 11 uploads for him (8 unique changes in the context of 7 bugs; including autopkgtests fixes, and security superseded). <<BR>> 
Again, it's high-quality work from the SRU bug template to the debdiff, and I only had minor changes/suggestions over time (usually DEP-3 details, e.g., the Description: field's line continuation per deb822, that I'd only explain to a few people), and only once repeated something (which in fact he promptly fixed up in the next debdiff after security superseded our upload).

He's been attentive to the process and follow-on work, not letting things get stuck, working on autopkgtests regressions/fix-ups (LP#1772556, LP#1908473/LP#1912969), and being there for regressions from his uploads when it happened (LP#2049262, LP#2059197). He's also worked on improving Ubuntu in the development release too (LP#1912122 and LP#1910307).

Conversely, I've been lucky to have Matthew review my work/patches a few times in internal processes to deliver fixes elsewhere. <<BR>>
This confirmed my observations about his attention to detail, consistency and adherence to the source code for correct backports, perception for risks, consideration for regression potential, and velocity to come up to speed on new contexts and code bases. 

I fully trust Matthew to become an SRU Developer, based on direct experience and feedback from other SRU Developers. <<BR>>
I'm sure that, all such traits he applied to successfully produce his own SRUs, he will also apply to review others' SRUs as well, <<BR>>
to the improvement of correctness and maintenance of stability in Ubuntu Stable Releases.

I also trust that Matthew would ask for help if unsure or if it's needed or prudent (as seen for the resolution of a high-profile regression in LP#1988119, for which he asked for input/reviews from multiple teams, to ensure quality and identify potential issues early).

P.S.: I'm pleased with this point in his motivation for applying; from the start, it's not just unblocking himself, but also others:

> I would like to provide sponsorship coverage for the APAC region, <<BR>>
> and help my APAC colleagues in Sustaining Engineering get their <<BR>>
> patches sponsored without having to rely on other geolocations.

==== Specific Experiences of working together ====

There's a lot more that goes on internally in our work in SEG, which is not in Launchpad. <<BR>>
In LP, an example I'd like to call out is LP#1926139, in which we collaborated on several stages to fix a
race condition in dhclient, abandoned upstream, with considerations for regressions (critical package)
and precision for test steps/synthetic reproducers, and quality assurance from affected cloud providers as well.  
It's been a pleasure working with Matthew on this one, and other bugs as well.

There's also LP#1960863, which showcases his exceptionally well-balanced skillset (depth and breadth), with a great undertanding of computer architecture, system software and userspace applications (and kernel, in other cases), from my observations.

That SRU received very positive review feedback from Robie Basak (comment #7), whose reviews I'm a fan of and have been a great source of education for me: <<BR>>
'This was a perfectly researched and written up bug and patch and made SRU review easy. Thank you!'

==== Areas of Improvement ====

Very minor, and this probably has already been addressed since the SRUs I reviewed/noted this on,
but as I have to write something here: the DEP-3 nitpicks (it's important to not only know DEP-3, but
actually understand the fields and reasons in it, why some are required/optional, and format details).
