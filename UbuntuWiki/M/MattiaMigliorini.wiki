<<BR>><<BR>>

My name is Mattia and I am from Veneto, Italy. I was born on November 18th, 1992 and studied in a scientific high school, where I approached German language too (only a little bit though). In 2008 I started learning the basic languages to build a simple website (mainly HTML and CSS) on my own. That began as a joke, but became my job some years later.<<BR>>
Now I study Computer Science at the University of Padova and at the same time work as a Web Designer freelance (head on to my <nowiki>[[http://www.deshack.net|website]]</nowiki> and have a look. If I haven't already, I'll make a section on that matter).
<<BR>>
I use Linux since 2005, when my uncle introduced me to Kubuntu, which I abandoned three years later when they implemented KDE 4.0. I switched to Ubuntu and loved it, but then - again, some years later - it became too havy for my 512MB RAM-powered PC. So I tried something else (Xubuntu, Lubuntu), landing on Arch''''''Linux for quite some time and trying Gentoo Linux, with Kernel Panics. Now I am again on Ubuntu and love Unity: it's beautiful and intuitive!

<<BR>><<BR>>
As an <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu-it.org|Ubuntu Italy]]</nowiki> contributor I am active since July 2012 in the following groups:

=== Translations Team ===

Even if I am not really a member of this team, I like contributing when I can. I began contributing in July, 2012 and so far I worked on the following translations:
* <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/guitartuner|Guitar Tuner]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/pyenglish|PYEnglish]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/serverguide|Ubuntu Server Guide]]</nowiki>

* <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/mixxx|Mixxx]]</nowiki>

=== Website Team ===

Since September 3rd, 2012 I am a member of the <nowiki>[[http://wiki.ubuntu-it.org/GruppoWeb|Italian Website Team]]</nowiki>, in which I can contribute with my knowledge and passion, mostly by writing and reviewing page contents.

=== Press Team ===

Since February 2013 I am leader of the <nowiki>[[http://wiki.ubuntu-it.org/UfficioStampa|Italian Press Team]]</nowiki>, along with Flavia Weisghizzi. I'm working hard to let this group work at its best.

== Future Goals ==

As I'm studying Computer Science, I'm interested in contributing to Ubuntu as a Developer. That's my plan for the future and I'd like to start soon.

== Other Projects ==

=== 2viLUG ===

I am one of the founder of Dueville Linux User Group, <nowiki>[[http://www.dueville.linux.it|2viLUG]]</nowiki>, and I see it as a creature of mine. I really love it, especially because it is born in a little town, but immediately caused a lot of interest in other people.

=== Engeene ===

This is half a job and half an hobby. <nowiki>[[http://www.engeene.it|Engeene]]</nowiki> is a "Social Tech Blog" that writes about Google, Amazon and Canonical. I work in it as Editor specialized on Chrome World since January 2012 and 
on various things around Canonical, Ubuntu and ubuntu-it since April 17th, 2013, when this section was born.
