=== About Me ===
I am a fan of all things GNU/Linux, especially Ubuntu.  I have used some form of a Linux distribution since about 1998, moving to Ubuntu in 2007 with Ubuntu 7.04 (Feisty).  The last time I used a non-free operating on my home computer was probably 2001 or 2002.

Besides things Open Source, I enjoy Basketball (Go Cavs! We don’t need Lebron!), Psychology, Physics, and Eastern Philosophy. I also enjoy nature, fishing, camping and anything else outdoors.
