08:58	Keybuk	mjg59: are you around this evening?
09:00	LaserJock	hi Keybuk
09:00	mjg59	Keybuk: Yes
09:00	mjg59	Though possibly slightly time-limited
09:00	Keybuk	let's get going then
09:00	Keybuk	I'm not expecting mdz, he's walking back from Scotland or something
09:01	ogra	heh
09:01	mjg59	Cool.
09:01	LaserJock	and no sabdfl?
09:01	Keybuk	are there any MOTU applicants awaiting Tech Board blessing?
09:01	mjg59	LaserJock: Also travelling
09:02	Keybuk	in fact, I don't think any members of the MOTU Council are actually here <g>
09:02	Keybuk	moving on then
09:02	Keybuk	ubuntu-core-dev applicants
09:02	Keybuk	LaserJock:
=== ogra cheers
09:02	LaserJock	yep
09:02	Keybuk	we received the recommendation from the MOTU Council via e-mail, and now seems like as good a time as any
09:03	Keybuk	please introduce yourself, say a little about what you've been doing in universe; and also what you'd like to do in main
09:03	LaserJock	ok
09:03	LaserJock	My name is Jordan Mantha, I'm a PhD Physical Chemistry student
09:03	Keybuk	(and click the "join this team" button in Launchpad ... it helps <g>)
09:04	LaserJock	I've been a MOTU for over a year, mostly involved with MOTU Science (team lead), MOTU education and mentoring new people
09:04	LaserJock	I authored the Ubuntu Packaging Guide
09:04	LaserJock	and do various things around Ubuntu
09:04	LaserJock	In Main my primary interest is in Edubuntu
09:04	ogra	LaserJock is *the* number one edubuntu contributor, he helped from nearly day one with packaging, bugfixing and docs  ... he often helps out on main packages since the beginning and i'd appreciate if he could upload himself
09:04	LaserJock	I've been to the last 3 UDSs and have been working on a few specs
09:05	LaserJock	I also maintain the edubuntu-docs package
09:05	LaserJock	I'm primarily interested in the desktop related stuff in Edubuntu
09:05	LaserJock	looking at educational apps and getting things pushed onto the Addon CD
09:06	LaserJock	as well as trying to give teachers/students the best experience possible
09:06	LaserJock	that's mostly it
09:06	LaserJock	if you want more I'd be happy to elaborate
09:06	Keybuk	mjg59: any questions?
09:06	mjg59	LaserJock: So you're interested more in the upper layers of edubuntu than the low-level stuff?
09:06	LaserJock	yes
09:07	mjg59	Ok
09:07	LaserJock	I'm a Chemist by training and I'm very keen on getting Edubuntu into Universities
09:07	LaserJock	so I'm looking at the default app selection and categorizing menus/apps, etc.
09:07	jikanter	But, since you are a chemistry student, isn't their device drivers for pH probes and stuff like that? are you interested in that?
09:07	mjg59	Improving the default experience is a good plan
09:07	LaserJock	I leave most of the heavy lifting like LTSP and network auth stuff to ogra
09:08	LaserJock	;_)
09:08	LaserJock	jikanter: to some extent yes
09:08	ogra	you do a lot of heavy lifting in the package area
09:08	mjg59	How would you rate edubuntu at the moment?
09:08	LaserJock	although I'm personally less interested in hardware than educational apps
09:09	LaserJock	mjg59: hmm, it's very good as an LTSP server
09:09	LaserJock	we need to do more work polishing up the Addon CD, IMO, as ogra well knows
09:09	LaserJock	Feisty was the first time in Ubuntu we've used a 2nd CD
09:09	LaserJock	and I think we need to work more on getting apps for teachers
09:09	LaserJock	we've already got things like moodle in the works
09:10	LaserJock	and I plan on sponsoring some of that work
09:10	ogra	but it surely lacks in the edu application area ... where LaserJock is been very very helpful in the past with finding the right thing for the task and even caring for it
09:10	LaserJock	I've been working on MIR Candidates
09:10	LaserJock	and writing up the MIRs
09:10	LaserJock	and I then plan to more-or-less maintain the apps I get into Main
09:11	LaserJock	I'd also like to develop the volunteer dev community in Edubuntu
09:11	LaserJock	we have 2 people who expressed an interest at Sevilla in becoming MOTUs
09:11	ogra	yeah, i was about to mention that you currently train motu hopefuls :)
09:11	LaserJock	I'd like to help them along that path and sponsor their work, if needed, in Main
09:13	LaserJock	mjg59: so overall I think Edubuntu is on a very good path
09:13	LaserJock	but because of the Universe/Main separation and Canonical supportability, it's a little behind some of the other edu distros when it comes to app selection
09:13	mjg59	Ok
09:14	mjg59	So being in a better position to maintain stuff in main would help that
09:14	LaserJock	yes
09:14	ogra	a lot
09:14	mjg59	Keybuk: Anything from you?
09:15	Keybuk	mjg59: I'm pretty happy actually
09:15	mjg59	Yes, me too
09:15	ogra	\o/
09:15	Keybuk	Ok
09:15	Keybuk	+1 from me
09:15	mjg59	+1 here
09:15	ogra	congrats LaserJock !
09:15	LaserJock	thanks
09:15	ogra	that was a long way
09:15	mjg59	Welcome to a larger bugload!
09:15	LaserJock	hehe
09:15	sbalneav	\o/ for LaserJock
09:15	LaserJock	thank sbalneav
09:16	stgraber	congrats LaserJock
09:16	Keybuk	err, ignore the deactive bounce there
09:16	Keybuk	LP confused me with its button layout *again*
09:16	Keybuk	do we have any other business?
09:16	ogra	you know where to complain :)
09:17	jikanter	congrats LaserJock
09:17	LaserJock	thank you jikanter
09:18	mjg59	I'm still working on a writeup on Automatix
09:18	LaserJock	ah good, I'll be glad to see it
09:19	Keybuk	mjg59: how's that going?
09:19	highvolt1ge	LaserJock: I've thought about that too, before
09:20	mjg59	Mildly blocked by real world stuff
09:20	mjg59	Should be done by next meeting. I'll mail the board.
09:21	Keybuk	*nods*
09:24	Keybuk	in that case, let's adjourn for now
09:24	Keybuk	thanks all
</pre>
