=== About: ===
Hello everyone !

I'm Mostafa Berg, software developer, I've been using Ubuntu for some time now , and I really liked it !.

I'm hoping that in the near future everyone will be using Linux !.

I encourage Free/Libre software, and I'm doing my own Free software too !.

hopefully one day someone will find any of my projects useful, use it and add to it, then pass it on !.

I recommend to everyone reaching this page to try Linux, and reading about free software !.
