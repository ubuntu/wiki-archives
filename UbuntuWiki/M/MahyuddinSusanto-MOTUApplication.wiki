=== Who i am ===
I'm Mahyuddin Susanto, Male coming from Surabaya Indonesia. I'm 26 years old and worked in ISP as system administrator.
Also, i'm sysadmin in Ubuntu Indonesia LoCo and as LoCo contact.

=== My Ubuntu Story ===
I started using Linux in 2004 using Suse but migrate to Debian in 2005. I Started using Ubuntu immediately after using Debian. I choose dual boot within Debian and Ubuntu until now.

In my work, i use Ubuntu LTS for several service like Mail, FTP, etc.

==== My involvement ====
I'm contributing via merge, sync, sru, triaging FTBFS bug through sponsors right now. While fixing a bug i always forwarding to Debian and Upstream

Security bug is my concern however i'm not a part of ubuntu-security member but i'm trying to fixing security bug especially CVE if i can do.

I've also helping Ubuntu during gold linker and gcc4.6 (w-error-security) bug, all of my patches has been forwarded to Debian. you can see <nowiki>[[http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?correspondent=udienz%40ubuntu.com;archive=both;severity=serious|serious bug]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?correspondent=udienz%40ubuntu.com;archive=1|archived bug]]</nowiki>

In Debian, i've joined and active in pkg-proftpd, pkg-games, pkg-cacti. All of their packages synced easily to Ubuntu. You can see my Debian QA page <nowiki>[[http://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=udienz@ubuntu.com|udienz@ubuntu.com]]</nowiki>

=== Examples of my work / Things I'm very proud of ===
'''This list may not up to date''', please refer to <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~udienz/+uploaded-packages|Launchpad page]]</nowiki> or <nowiki>[[http://ubuntu-dev.alioth.debian.org/cgi-bin/ubuntu-sponsorships.cgi?render=html&sponsor=&sponsor_search=name&sponsoree=Mahyuddin+Susanto&sponsoree_search=name|Alioth page]]</nowiki>

=== Plans to the future ===
==== Things I could do better ====
* Read wiki's again and consult with sponsors. Also improve my english
* I'd love to packaging/triaging server related bugs, so my goal in the future is join Server Team.

==== General feedback ====
I have sponsored several packages:
* squid3 - LP: #718127 - needed some small changes before upload
* wordpress - LP: #716641 - went well
* gkamus - LP: #790101 - went well
* lighttpd - LP: #906792 - needed some changes before upload
* proftpd-dfsg - LP: #905252 - In progress (patch-needswork)
* cacti - LP: #906773 - ok (weirdness with downloaded patch and dropped line at end-- perhaps LP problem)

wordpress and gkamus were of good quality. squid3 was not bad, but needed to be updated for the security pocket. The more recent lighttpd and proftpd-dfsg needed some work and before uploading.

==== Areas of Improvement ====
First of all, thank you Mahyuddin for your sustained contribution to Ubuntu. It is very much appreciated. At this time I am neutral to endorse Mahyuddin for MOTU. While I understand that most developers don't know the ins and outs of security updates (I certainly am not holding this against Mahyuddin), the majority of work I've done with him has been in this area and there are still little things cropping up in the submitted patches.

==== Areas of Improvement ====
Better english in his changelog which he has improved a lot I think of late and he often gets nervous while speaking or asking something which might be because of english being his non-native language which is uncalled for I think.

=== Angel Abad (angelabad) ===
