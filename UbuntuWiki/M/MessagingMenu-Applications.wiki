We want people to make awesome applications for the MessagingMenu. Let's list them here, get them tested and packaged up nicely! This would be a great opportunity for application authors to push their apps with the new PostReleaseApps work.

App authors: Remember if you need help porting your application (or writing a new one) that you can get help on #ayatana on freenode or on the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ayatana|Ayatana]]</nowiki> mailing list.
