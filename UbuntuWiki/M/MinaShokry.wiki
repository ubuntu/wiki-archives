__TOC__

I am a developer who is interested in open source software especially Java and Ubuntu.

I wish to have chance to contribute in one of them.

I think Ubuntu is the greatest open source software till now and I hope I can contribute in it, but I don't know how to start.

Personally, I expect a very good future for Ubuntu. It will be really a good alternative of Microsoft Windows that will end its domination on personal computers.
