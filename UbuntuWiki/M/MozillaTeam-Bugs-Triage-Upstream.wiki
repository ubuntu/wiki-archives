__TOC__



Our direct core upstream is now the Mozilla Foundation, this was changed as per Feisty Fawn, anything before Feisty it is Debian, this was changed due to trademark issues, <nowiki>[[MozillaTeam/Trademarks]]</nowiki>.

Once the report has enough information we usually send it back to the original code developer(s), we do this because we cannot fix every bug we receive as we wouldn't have much time at all, this is known as sending it upstream.

When doing this you have to keep in mind that sending a report upstream is designed to speed up the process of bug fixing, thus sending insufficient and/or incorrect information helps nobody, (please, please ask if you are stuck), once you have enough information select the correct upstream tracker, a report the bug yourself, please see <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bugs/HowToTriage#head-ab0eb9d7731fa877b5fc866eedc4c312dab50ee7|this]]</nowiki> entry for more detail.
