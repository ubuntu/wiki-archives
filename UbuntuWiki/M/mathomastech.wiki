=== Introduction ===
I am a software developer with personal open source projects in Web and Linux. I've been a supporter for Linux since I first was introduced to it in 2009. Since then, I have used several distributions including Ubuntu (Stock), Mint, Fedora, and finally settling on Ubuntu GNOME. You can find me at any of the links under my name, or by searching for <nowiki>[[https://www.google.com/#q=mathomastech|mathomastech]]</nowiki>.

I have my BS in Computer Information Systems, and have a real passion for technology. I spend a lot of my free time hacking on personal projects, and getting others involved with technology.

=== Current Projects ===
* Reviving my local LUG <<BR>>
* Personal Projects: See <nowiki>[[https://github.com/mathomastech|Github]]</nowiki> for current projects<<BR>>
* Contributions: None yet - Will be joining Ubuntu GNOME team in the near future
