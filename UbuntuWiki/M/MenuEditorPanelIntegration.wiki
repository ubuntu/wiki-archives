TravisWatkins: You'd need to design custom widgets (GtkMenu doesn't support this kind of stuff) and basically port alacarte (smeg) to C to make these widgets actually do things in order to make this work. I'm not sure it's worth the effort or if it's even possible. However, it might be possible to add in some of the functionality GNOME 2.6 had by calling alacarte with a DesktopFileID that I can show the Entry Editor or Menu Editor dialog for.
