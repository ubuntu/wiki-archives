This page defines the common (and perhaps special) terminology used in the gesture development community.

=== Glossary ===

==== Gesture Primitives ====

 drag:: a user makes contact with the touch surface, and than moves continuously in a direction;  contact is maintained with the touch surface until the end of the gesture

 pinch/spread:: a user makes two or more distinct contacts with the touch surface and separates them or brings them together, respectively

 flick:: a user makes contact with the touch surface, and then moves in a particular direction, losing contact with the surface in the process; unlike a drag, contact is broken after the movement

 hold:: a user makes contact with the touch surface and then maintains that contact point; no movement is associated with this gesture

 rotate:: a user makes two or more distinct contacts with the touch surface and pivots about an arbitrary point (with one hand, this is the wrist)

 tap:: a user makes a brief contact with the touch surface and then breaks contact; no movement is associated with this gesture

==== Complex Gestures ====

 compositional analysis:: breaking down a complex gesture (e.g., simultaneous gestures, gesture chains, parallel gestures) into individual components; the components can be present at a single point in time or over a given time span

 gesture result preview:: A hint (preview) of what will happen if a user finalizes a particular gesture.  

 gesture chains:: a successive set of distinct gestures; this is often combined with simultaneous gestures (e.g., a tap and then a drag)

 parallel gestures:: two or more hands making separate, independent gestures providing in respective, independent results

 gesture result range:: a gesture that, through a range of motion, effects a naturally ordered range of results.  For example a zoom gesture in a file manager could change the view along a continuum of file display options starting with a simple list view and ending with large thumbnails. 

 simultaneous gestures:: two distinct gestures performed at the same time with one hand (e.g., performing an expand gesture while dragging across a screen)
