__TOC__

I am a software developer and Linux Sysadmin. My core software skills include Java, Oracle, XML & web services, whilst on the hardware side I have knowledge of Sun and Intel kit running Solaris, Windows and several Linux distros. I have a reasonable working knowledge of Xen for commerial VPS provisioning for running multiple instances of JBoss on a single physical server.

I now have several Ubuntu installations, one on a Sony VAIO A497XP - most of the early niggles have been ironed out now, but there are still a few issues, documented here... https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LaptopTestingTeam/SonyVaioA497XP 

I have experience of Redhat 6.2 to FC, RHEL, and CentOS. Ubuntu and Debian based distros are something I started looking at a couple of years ago... it's the way forward!
