== Main Inclusion Report for `libnss-mdns` ==

# ''Availability:'' Available in universe/unstable, Arch: all supported archs
# ''Rationale:'' nss-mdns is a plugin for the GNU Name Service Switch (NSS) functionality of the GNU C Library (glibc) providing host name resolution via Multicast DNS (aka Zeroconf, aka Apple Rendezvous, aka Apple Bonjour), effectively allowing name resolution by common Unix/Linux programs in the ad-hoc mDNS domain .local. Nss-mdns uses Avahi-daemon to resolve hostnames.
