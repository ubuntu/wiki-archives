== Mobile Team Reporting Page ==

Welcome to the Mobile Team reporting page. Every month this page should be filled with bullet points indicating the summary of some of the work you have been working on. As you work on something, try to summarize it here. A few guidelines for how to write good points here:

* Keep it simple and short - single sentences are best. :)
* Try to summarize your work and not be over-detailed - we don't need to know specifics, just a summary of the kind of work involved
* Where possible, include relevant links.

You should get all your reporting included here by the '''22nd''' of every month.

** Bug #349097 - sources.list corrupted on mid (lpia) install
* Worked with lpia kernel configurations
* Testing for Beta, for MID and UNR
* Reviewed testcases on testcases.qa.ubuntu.com to see what's already out there and what still needs to be written 
* Tested the kernel patch in bug 349313 on Eee900, it fixes the slowness problem
* Executed LaptopTesting tests on Eee900
* Tested beta images for LSB compliance
* Update clutter to a new release
* continued debugging of Hildon-desktop crash issue
* converted LSB test results from html to wiki and posted results online
* Work on cairo VFP enablement
* Testing notify-osd on UNR for inclusion
* Did some research on what would be needed for automation to work on UNR
* Prepare documentation on writing .img files for Windows, Linux, Mac OS X
* Coordinate documentation requirements to support inclusion of UNR in
Jaunty Release materials
* Created a list of Netbooks that have been tested, how well they work,
and any known issue on them for the Jaunty release
* Modified hardening-wrapper to serve as lpia-wrapper
* Multiple test runs and image install testing on UNR, MID, and ARM
* preparing wikipages for certain images (i.e. BabbageInstall)

=== ARM ===
* Worked on image creation with Oliver
* Researched ways to avoid having the size of the initramfs hardcoded in the RedBoot bootscript
* Looked into some armel bugs/usage issues
* Pushed vfp pass for glibc
* Handed over VFP work to Emmet
* Packaged redboot-tools to hold fis.c and fconfig.c
* flash-kernel support for imx51/babbage
* Summed up kernel issues for Babbage installation instructions/release notes
* Tested iop32x flavour further and found the boot issue was only with an initramfs; issue was a config not being set in the kernel
* image building for the babbage board
* writing build scripts for babbage image
* preparing, testing and re-rolling beta imx51 images (http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/jaunty/beta/)
* bugs worked on during image building:
** 349526 rtl8187 support on imx51
** 348504 USB issues with linux-image-2.6.28-11-imx51 fill /var/log
** 348660 ubiquity unsets ubiquity/install_bootloader=false
** 349504 enforced password update if system date is set to 01-01-1970
** 348060 initial bootloader configuration on imx51 images
** 348411 SD offered as target if live media is SD (/dev/mmcblk0)
** 348382 imx51 is missing a dependency on flash-kernel
** Finished porting alternate installer to iMX51 Babbage (base-installer has been uploaded yay)
** Modified the seeds to get the imx51 kernel onto the ARM CDs by default
** Benchmarked VFP libgcc_s and noted the results on the wiki
** Rescored and retried failed ARM builds
** Confirmed libipc-sharelite-perl issue still exists with current kernel on rimu
** Resolved kdeaccessibility FTBFS (pending upload)
* Added support for iMX51 in flash-kernel; added flash-kernel.conf support, current version is clean of any kludges now
* Added NEON hwcaps in glibc and flagged the new hwcaps as important as well (like VFP)
* Benchmarked VFP libgcc
* Completed backport on redboot-tools
* Further investigate ubiquity bootloader installation failure for armel, and prepare workaround patch
* Replicate pango1.0 arm-vfp logic in gtk+2.0
* trace and fix installer bugs on babbage board live install
* finish flash-kernel and flash-kernel-installer scriptiong for imx51 (babbage) architecture
* fix bootloader issues on imx51 introduced through new cdimage creation
* Began debugging gnome-keyring-daemon issues; discovered a workaround compiling with -O1 vs -O2 which allows keyring to work fully on ARM
* Resolved login and install * Wrote scripts for Babbage dailies for live and d-i CDs; this look multiple days to implement, test etc.; fixed some other things along the way
* Ship fconfig default data in redboot; cleanup the package
* Allow casper to work on our babbage sd card deviceation issue when system clock is set to January 1st, 1970
* Merged most of KDE ARM patches upstream to have to drop
* pre RC NSLU2 testing
* Pushed VFP gtk+2.0, pango, and ffmpeg-debian; required a lot of time
   to testbuild, fix, QA, and upload; sent VFP-enabled cairo to Debian,
   required substantive time by itself and is too intrusive for jaunty
* Uploaded initramfs-tools running flash-kernel after update-initramfs

** Launched testing for Beta release
* Discussed UNR testcases with Paul Larson
