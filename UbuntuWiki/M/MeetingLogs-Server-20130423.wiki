 16:00:25 <yolanda> #topic Review ACTION points from previous meeting

 16:02:39 <yolanda> (carried forward) arosales to follow up with Norvald regarding SRU

 16:03:02 <jamespage> hmm arosales is not around yet

 16:03:08 <smoser> copy over.

 16:03:10 <jamespage> yolanda, park that one for the time being

 16:03:18 <yolanda> ok

 16:03:29 <yolanda> zul to send notes from review of complexity of packaging perconia for Ubuntu to the ubuntu-server list

 16:03:46 <zul> oops need to be done

 16:04:03 <jamespage> zul, I think that would make a good session for next vUDS

 16:04:13 <jamespage> specifically to talk about packaging etc....

 16:04:18 <zul> jamespage:  *sigh* ok :)

 16:04:21 <arosales> hello

 16:04:25 <yolanda> hi

 16:04:35 <jamespage> zul, maybe you could grab upstream and get them to come along as well

 16:04:43 <zul> jamespage:  sure

 16:04:44 * arosales apologizes in advance of not updating the minutes

 16:04:45 * arosales fail

 16:05:42 <yolanda> (carried forward) arosales to follow up with Norvald regarding SRU

 16:06:21 <jamespage> arosales, did that happen?

 16:06:28 <arosales> yolanda, still a todo on my part

 16:06:37 <arosales> yolanda, no need to continue tracking it here though

 16:06:40 <yolanda> ok

 16:06:46 <arosales> I got a task out

 16:06:55 <yolanda> next one then

 16:06:56 <yolanda> (carried forward) smoser to reach out to juju-core and discuss what integration with ubuntu image meta data can be done for Raring.

 16:07:24 <smoser> done.

 16:07:30 <yolanda> ok

 16:07:38 <yolanda> #topic Raring Development

 16:07:52 <yolanda> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RaringRingtail/ReleaseSchedule

 16:07:57 <yolanda> #subtopic Release Bugs

 16:08:14 <jamespage> yolanda, want me to pickup this section?

 16:08:21 <yolanda> thx

 16:08:33 <jamespage> OK - so http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-r-tracking-bug-tasks.html#server

 16:08:48 <jamespage> only four bugs outstanding - none of those will make release

 16:08:58 <jamespage> so deferred until next release

 16:09:12 <jamespage> #subtopic Blueprints

 16:09:36 <jamespage> #link http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-raring/group/topic-raring-servercloud-overview.html

 16:10:10 <jamespage> so I would guess none of the outstanding work items will get done before thursday

 16:10:16 <jamespage> POSTPONE as required.

 16:11:00 <jamespage> all-in-all great cycle folks - loads of stuff delivered; slight less change in Debian helped us out a bit there!

 16:11:10 <jamespage> yolanda, back to you!

 16:11:17 <yolanda> #topic Ubuntu Server Team Events

 16:12:02 <yolanda> so last week ODS, and Cloud summit in 2 weeks

 16:12:02 <Daviey> All recovering from last week openstack summit :)

 16:12:08 <jamespage> anyone got any events in the next few weeks?

 16:12:12 <Daviey> There are some release parties this week. :)

 16:12:18 * jamespage is still somewhere over the atlantic

 16:12:46 <yolanda> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (plars)

 16:12:50 <arosales> m_3, is at http://www.railsconf.com/ this weekend

 16:13:09 <plars> hi

 16:13:15 <plars> I talked to roaksoax

 16:13:24 <plars> who said he would take a look at the maas tests I believe

 16:13:40 <plars> But any help anyone can provide with testing ISOs on server stuff this week would be great

 16:13:44 <plars> respin in progress right now

 16:14:00 <plars> That's all I have for now, and my primary focus for the moment

 16:14:25 <jamespage> plars, sure - it would be great if the whole team could sniff the ISO

 16:14:26 <yolanda> ok, next one

 16:14:29 <yolanda> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb)

 16:14:42 <jamespage> I know it has less relevance now but its still important!

 16:14:57 <smb> Hi, nothing again. Bits and pieces and preparing mentally for next week. :)

 16:15:23 <smb> Unfortunately server-team won't be there

 16:15:36 <smb> Are there things to bring up?

 16:16:13 <jamespage> smb, if it comes up a plan around dkms updates for precise backported kernels would be nice :-)

 16:16:49 <smb> jamespage, You got a Icare list?

 16:16:52 <Daviey> smb: We'd like to better understand how the kernel team, and QA team are going to identify regressions with all dkms packages

 16:16:57 <Daviey> (not just server, IMO)

 16:17:19 <jamespage> agreed - its not just server - although we have some specific we handle such as openvswitch and iscsitarget

 16:17:29 <smb> Right now there is a few "known" which is mostly the binary gfx drivers

 16:17:37 <jamespage> I know the xen blktap driver stuff bust as well

 16:19:25 <yolanda> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions regarding Ubuntu ARM Server (rbasak)

 16:19:51 <yolanda> rbasak doesn't seem to be here

 16:19:58 <Daviey> He gave his apologies

 16:20:07 <Daviey> (sorry for not mentioning it sooner)

 16:20:22 <yolanda> ok, i'll skip it then

 16:20:23 <yolanda> #topic Open Discussion

 16:20:50 <yolanda> anything to say?

 16:21:26 <arosales> Ubuntu Server rocked at ODS, nice work to all

 16:22:28 <jamespage> it was fun!

 16:22:54 <yolanda> nice experience

 16:23:06 <Daviey> It was great to see Openstack deployed via Ubuntu in HA - via juju

 16:23:20 <Daviey> & Landscape seemed to come out rather popular aswell.

 16:23:44 <jamespage> I'm working on the docs on deploying openstack in HA mode with juju - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ServerTeam/OpenStackHA

 16:23:54 <yolanda> i had some comments from a RedHat designer, he likes our Juju interface

 16:24:03 <Daviey> super

 16:24:46 <yolanda> hi, more topics?

 16:24:52 <jamespage> not from me!

 16:24:54 <Daviey> Do we need a full meeting next week?  Or would the time be better spent on blueprint drafting & sync/merges?

 16:25:17 <Daviey> (Call for topics - will be sent tomorrow BTW)

 16:25:54 <Daviey> .. the week after is also a non-starter.. So May 14th?

 16:26:02 <Daviey> Agreed?

 16:26:15 <hallyn> sounds good

 16:26:24 <smoser> i like it

 16:26:26 <yolanda> ok

 16:26:30 <jamespage> +!

 16:26:31 <arosales> thanks for chairing yolanda

 16:26:32 <jamespage> +1
