** What do upstream call this software ?  Has it had different names in the past ? Upstream calls it '''kboot''', but is is packaged specifically for ps3's. Package we use was stripped considerably from stock upstream to make use of GNU libc (instead of uclibc) and removed many parts of the tarball that were not needed by normal users.
