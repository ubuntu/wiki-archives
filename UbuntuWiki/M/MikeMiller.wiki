I am a free software developer and advocate interested in packaging software for Ubuntu. My primary interests at the moment are the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/gnome|GNOME desktop]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/octave|GNU Octave]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/rpm|RPM]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/yum|YUM]]</nowiki> interoperability, and <nowiki>[[http://www.infradead.org/openconnect|OpenConnect]]</nowiki>.

=== Contributions to Ubuntu ===

So far I have packaged and helped with bug reports on <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openconnect|openconnect]]</nowiki>. I am looking for other ways to get involved with Ubuntu development at the moment.

I recently joined the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-us-dc|DCLoCo]]</nowiki> and am looking forward to getting involved with the community.

=== Contributions to Debian ===

I am a Debian Developer and maintain a handful of <nowiki>[[http://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=mtmiller%40ieee.org|packages]]</nowiki> in Debian which I also test in Ubuntu and watch for bug reports. In my role as a DD I am aware of the collaboration with Ubuntu and try to do my part to help improve cooperation and communication.
