== Main inclusion report for wacom-tools ==

=== Requirements ===

1. ''Availability:'' http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/w/wacom-tools

2. ''Rationale:'' This package is required in order to support Wacom touchscreens used in tablet PCs

3. ''Security:'' No known security issues. Requirement for user to have read/write access to the serial port used.
