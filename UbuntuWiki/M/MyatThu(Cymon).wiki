I have played around with Linux since 2014.Being a Network Engineer,Ubuntu becomes my main and best choice. I initially tried CentOs, but after trying Ubuntu 14.4 and later Ubuntu 14.10, I settled on Ubuntu as my favourite Linux distro. Currently I have Ubuntu 16.4 LTS installed on all of my computers, as well as a couple of virtual computers that are mainly used for my studies and network engineering.
I learned about Ubuntu since 2013 because of strong community and i believed that Ubuntu gives a lot of benefits for my career.

As a University Student, i  mainly helping out with my classmates and Ubuntu Myanmar LoCo Team Movement. and the biggest Barcamp in Barcamp Yangon 2015(Colourful Barcamp) Volunteer.
