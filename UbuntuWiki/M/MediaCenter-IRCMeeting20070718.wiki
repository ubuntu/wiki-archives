This is a quick summary of the (fastest, 5 minutes) UMC team weekly meeting, that took
place on Wed. July 18th, 2007 on Freenode in #elisa.

=== Elisa ===
the Elisa team is attending the GUADEC until next saturday

=== Artwork ===

no news. only, on ubuntu art, an interesting proposal of xdg-user-dirs icon set for Ubuntu Human theme:

since there is nothing new on the next points, let's jump to a new one ^_ ^

=== Distro ===

I (ArnaudQuette) have so started the Distro effort. Many thanks to Mario Limonciello (Mythbuntu leader) for bootstrapping me

it's still in early dev stage, iso can't yet be generated and there are still many things to be done: 

https://code.launchpad.net/~umc-team/

==== Update ====

* For testing iso generation, do the following:

** bzr checkout http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~umc-team/umc/umc
** cd umc/livedisk/
** sudo ./umc_install.sh

 and check the very verbose output... and maybe the iso in the end ;-)

* Elisa package has reached the Gutsy repository:

 http://packages.ubuntu.com/gutsy/gnome/elisa

 but it's not installable due to python-pigment missing!
