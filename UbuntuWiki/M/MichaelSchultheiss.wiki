=== About Me ===

 '''IRC''' schultmc on irc.freenode.net and irc.oftc.net

 '''Background:''' I'm a Debian developer and Ubuntu user who lives in Indianapolis, Indiana.  I maintain several web applications for Debian and would like to see Ubuntu patches to my packages pushed back into Debian.  

I wear several FLOSS hats - In addition to being a Debian Developer and Ubuntero, I'm co-founder of the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/IndianaTeam|Indiana LoCo Team]]</nowiki>,  Treasurer of <nowiki>[[http://www.spi-inc.org|Software in the Public Interest]]</nowiki>, President of the <nowiki>[[http://www.cinlug.org|Central Indiana Linux Users Group]]</nowiki>, and a core team member of the <nowiki>[[http://gallery.sf.net|Gallery Project]]</nowiki>.
