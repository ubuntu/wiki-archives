** Automatic CUPS queue setup for printers detected by HAL. This is part of what fedora uses since FC6.
 0. ''Security:''

** Not in Debian, actively maintained in Fedora.
** No serious bugs upstream.
** Does not deal with hardware except printers and only indirectly via HAL.

 0. ''Standards compliance:'' 
** Standard CDBS packaging, files installed in standard paths.
