== Main Inclusion Report for devicekit ==

=== Requirements ===

# ''Availability:'' <nowiki>[[http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/d/devicekit]]</nowiki>; available for all supported architectures
# ''Rationale:''
** GNOME 2.27 (and the Linux world in general) will move from the huge and hard to maintain hal to several smaller and more agile components: DeviceKit as a small basic D-Bus interface to udev, and DK-{disks,power,*} as particular services.
** Build/binary dependency of devicekit-power, which is in turn needed for current gnome-power-manager.
0. ''Security:''
** <nowiki>[[http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=devicekit|CVE entries]]</nowiki>: None
** <nowiki>[[http://secunia.com/search/?search=devicekit|Secunia history]]</nowiki>: None
** D-Bus activated service running as root, similar to hal.
** No network activity.
** Shallow source code review performed: no manual memory allocation, no sprintf or other insecure constructs, properly uses d-bus, udev, and glib higher level APIs
0. ''Quality assurance:''
** Background daemon, not user visible. Works out of the box.
** No debconf.
** Not in Debian yet.
** <nowiki>[[http://hal.freedesktop.org/docs/DeviceKit/|upstream]]</nowiki> is vigorous
** <nowiki>[[https://bugs.freedesktop.org/buglist.cgi?product=DeviceKit&component=DeviceKit&keywords=&bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED|Upstream bug tracker]]</nowiki>: No bugs
** Does not deal with particular hardware.
** No test suite.
# ''UI standards:'' N/A, no UI, just D-Bus interface
# ''Standards compliance:'' 
** <nowiki>[[http://www.pathname.com/fhs/|FHS]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[http://www.de.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/|Debian Policy]]</nowiki> compliant
** Simple standard cdbs/debhelper packaging, no patches
# ''Dependencies:'' all in main
# ''Maintenance:''
** How much maintenance is this package likely to need ? Little to none, DeviceKit itself has no logic, it's ust an interface shim (and will probably go away in the future completely, in favor of DK-* talking to udev directly)
** MartinPitt will look after the package in Ubuntu, maintenance will be shared with Debian's pkg-utopia team.
0. ''Background information:''
** The general purpose and context of the package is be clear from the package's debian/control file.
** What do upstream call this software? DeviceKit
