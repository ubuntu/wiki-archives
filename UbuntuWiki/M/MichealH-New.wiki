|}

I am '''Micheal Harker''', a 14 year old from Durham,UK. I have contributed to Ubuntu quite a bit in the past 2 years. I have used Ubuntu for 4 years and I have thoroughly enjoyed using Ubuntu. Ubuntu has shaped me into the FOSS/OSS loving person I am today, if it actually was not for Ubuntu, I would not have even considered Linux. I am considered a Administration and Developing Guy and I am relaxed and keen to meet people from all parts of Ubuntu. I have my Testimonials at the bottom of the page, so if you would like to see what people have to say about me, please do look at the bottom, Thanks!

'''Now on to the (possibly boring) stuff, my Contributions ;-) '''

''' IRC Is my Life, If you need me urgently PM me, I am always online and I will get your message when I sign-in.''' I love IRC! I am in almost all of the team channels I listed above. I am sometimes very busy, but will always be happy to take my time to talk. Also, I am saying this on a new line so everyone knows:

''' DO NOT ASK to PM me, I will not bite :-) '''

<nowiki>[[MichealH]]</nowiki> has proven to be an excellent programmer. He has done great work on <nowiki>[[SpeechControl-InfernoBot|InfernoBot]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[SpeechControl]]</nowiki> and I really enjoy having him in the team. I can just recommend him for UBT membership and Ubuntu Membership! -- <nowiki>[[Daniel0108]]</nowiki>

----

Micheal has been a contributer at Ubuntu forums for some time. I find he is polite, enthusiastic, and eager to learn. He always shows respect to myself and others. I have kept up to date with his new Ubuzine and am quite eager to watch the project continue. - <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~uraharakisuke153|Virgil Brummond]]</nowiki>

----

I have collaborated with Micheal on IRC, and he is a very capable leader. His leadership qualities are best seen in his work on the Ubuntu Tour project and its website. Moreover, he is very much interested in Ubuntu Development and he often asks me on IRC about it. He plans to get involved in it as well. I strongly endorse his membership application. <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:bilalakhtar|Bilal Akhtar]]</nowiki>

----

Micheal certainly started his involvement in Ubuntu with enthusiasm, it is good to see that this has now been sustained for quite some time and Micheal is getting involved in contributing to more teams and taking part in activities such as <nowiki>[[http://irclogs.ubuntu.com/2010/10/22/%23ubuntu-classroom.html|classroom sessions]]</nowiki>. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:alanbell]]</nowiki>

This young man has astounded me with his progress. He is joy to have around, knowledgeable, friendly and his willingness to both help out on teams coupled with his desire to pass on what he has learned is a true testament to this young man. <nowiki>[[cproffit]]</nowiki> as always, you were right. He is a fantastic guy who I fully support for his UBT and Ubuntu membership.
