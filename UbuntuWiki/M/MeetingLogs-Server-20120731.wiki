 16:04:19 <jamespage> although I think someone read the list the wrong way round - I did it in the last two weeks I think

 16:05:15 * jamespage kills some stuff to make his machine respond

 16:05:33 <Daviey> jamespage: zul is next week :)

 16:05:40 <zul> hah funny

 16:05:58 <zul> im the furthest way to host a meeting :)

 16:06:09 <Daviey> zul: no you aren't :/

 16:06:15 <jamespage> #topic Review ACTION points from previous meeting

 16:06:32 <jamespage> arosales and daviey to work on trend line reset

 16:06:38 <jamespage> hows that going guys?

 16:06:48 <Daviey> longest defer of an item yet.

 16:06:48 <arosales> jamespage: that is in progress

 16:06:58 <jamespage> everyone update their blueprint status

 16:06:59 <arosales> I am working with skaet to get that updated

 16:07:05 <Daviey> superb

 16:07:06 * jamespage pokes everyone

 16:07:16 <Ursinha> roger that

 16:07:41 <jamespage> its a good time to replan outstanding work items for the next few milestones....

 16:07:54 <arosales> +1

 16:07:55 <arosales> :-)

 16:08:19 <jamespage> then arosales and Daviey can panic about whats not going to get done :-)

 16:08:21 <jamespage> anyway

 16:08:38 <jamespage> #topic Quantal Development

 16:08:50 <jamespage> #topic Release Bugs - http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/ubuntu-server/release-bugs.html

 16:09:21 <Daviey> jamespage: How do things look?

 16:10:00 <jamespage> couple of quantum bugs still outstanding - bug 1025203 and bug 1023066

 16:10:02 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1025203 in quantum (Ubuntu) "Trying to overwrite '/etc/quantum/plugins/openvswitch/ovs_quantum_plugin.ini', which is also in package quantum-server" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1025203

 16:10:03 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1023066 in quantum (Ubuntu) "python-quantum fails to install due to python syntax errors" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1023066

 16:10:58 <jamespage> might point to the new openstack core components not being exercised fully in the lab yet

 16:10:59 <Daviey> I haven't been adding a significant amount of items in the last week.

 16:11:19 <Daviey> Has anyone taken the gauntlet of seeing if there are additional things?

 16:11:52 <jamespage> #topic Blueprints - http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-precise/ubuntu-server.html

 16:11:53 <Daviey> The silence is pretty loud.

 16:12:06 <arosales> jamespage: I have a few to bring up

 16:12:21 <arosales> We are at week 14 of 25 (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QuantalQuetzal/ReleaseSchedule) and cresting the half-way point of the release.

 16:12:28 <arosales> Thus, Blueprints on average should be around the 50% marker. Flagging those blueprints <= 20%

 16:12:29 <jamespage> sorry this link - http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-quantal/ubuntu-server.html

 16:12:36 * jamespage hands over to arosales

 16:12:52 <arosales> rbasak: a couple of ARM blueprints need some love

 16:12:52 <Daviey> erm

 16:13:01 <arosales> 7% https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-server-benchmark-and-performance

 16:13:01 <arosales> 0% https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-arm-server-storage-testing

 16:13:09 <Daviey> ubuntu-server.html is no good.

 16:13:11 <arosales> Daviey:  did you have a comment?

 16:13:40 <Daviey> we've achieved 0% on community-q-irc-workshops, according to that

 16:13:54 <arosales> Daviey: I am also working skaet to get a overall topic for blueprints for Ubuntu server tracking

 16:13:56 <Daviey> community-q-unity-docs :(

 16:14:01 <Daviey> ok, super!

 16:14:12 <arosales> so hopefully that will help the reporting in the future

 16:14:32 <arosales> rbasak: I know you are just back in this week, but can you follow up with the arm blueprints?

 16:14:47 <arosales> 0% utlemming https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-cloud-images

 16:14:49 <rbasak> arosales: no problem, following up now

 16:14:59 <arosales> rbasak: thanks

 16:15:17 <arosales> Ursinha: I think this one is just pending reports which I think you may be working on: 20% https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-bug-triage-review

 16:15:41 <arosales> jamespage:  ISO test reviews: 17% https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-server-iso-tests-review

 16:15:48 <Ursinha> arosales, yes, I need to update my blueprints accordingly, will do that now

 16:15:55 <arosales> Ursinha: thanks

 16:16:10 <jamespage> arosales, most of the blueprint is targetted to beta-1 so not worried

 16:16:32 <arosales> jamespage: ok

 16:16:55 <arosales> Some Juju items in progress, a few under 20%

 16:17:01 <arosales> 10% https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-juju-charm-unit-tests

 16:17:01 <arosales> 19% https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-juju-charm-best-practices

 16:17:24 <arosales> Spamaps ^ for the logs as I think jimbaker and m_3 are out

 16:17:32 <arosales> 14% https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-libvirt

 16:18:01 <arosales> don't see hallyn here though

 16:18:09 <arosales> 14% https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-openstack-ha

 16:18:14 <arosales> roaksoax: ^

 16:18:39 <arosales> rbasak: are you getting some good feedback on your apt testing?

 16:18:40 <arosales> 0% https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-apt-improvements

 16:18:48 <roaksoax> waiting on Debian maintainer to see whether I update some stuff myself or take them from Debian

 16:18:58 <arosales> roaksoax: thanks

 16:19:00 <Daviey> So.. i'm expecting there is WI's not captured suitable for http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-precise/group/topic-precise-servercloud-infrastructure-deployment.html

 16:19:01 <roaksoax> arosales: I much rather do from debian, otherwise, will take care of it next week

 16:19:06 <Daviey> we aren't that far along :)

 16:19:15 <rbasak> I hit a bug with the apt by-hash mirror script. I've been working on this today. Expect a call for testing in a day or two.

 16:19:43 <arosales> Daviey: wow, that progress looks good

 16:19:53 <arosales> for precise though, right?

 16:19:54 <jamespage> hrm - that was last release

 16:20:06 <arosales> rbasak: thanks for working on apt :-)

 16:20:09 <Daviey> jamespage: you spotted the intentional error

 16:20:23 <arosales> utlemming: another one for you

 16:20:25 <arosales> 0% https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-push-to-the-clouds

 16:20:41 <utlemming> that's actually inprogress and almost done

 16:21:02 <arosales> adam_g: I am guessing we can't yet start on the charms yet probably why this one is at 0%  https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-openstack-charms

 16:21:03 <jamespage> all good for the beta-1 target then

 16:21:05 <Daviey> smoser: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-cloud-init-utils ?

 16:21:28 <arosales> utlemming: ok, I see  a few of those are in progress, thanks

 16:21:29 <smoser> well, i've made some progress on some of those things.

 16:21:37 <smoser> i thin honestly many will move to "DO NOT DO"

 16:21:47 <smoser> or POSTPONED

 16:21:53 <Daviey> or CBA

 16:21:56 <Daviey> :)

 16:22:03 <zul> arosales: openstack is in a state of flux on ubuntu, hope to get it back on track this week

 16:22:22 <arosales> ok, and charms follow that, gotcha

 16:22:26 <Daviey> shall we progress?

 16:22:34 <arosales> jamespage: those are the ones I had

 16:22:41 <jamespage> ok moving on then

 16:22:50 <jamespage> #topic 12.04.1 Development (jamespage & smoser)

 16:23:16 <smoser> i think that roaksoax has been banging this drum for maas

 16:23:19 <Daviey> jamespage / smoser: What is stopping 12.04.1 shipping today?

 16:23:23 <smoser> which was the one thing that really was still on our list

 16:23:36 <roaksoax> yeah

 16:23:48 <roaksoax> one of the things that concerns me is the readyness of MAAS without cobbler

 16:24:00 <roaksoax> we were expecting to have things a couple weeks ago but things are still in progress

 16:24:05 <jamespage> I think that is probably the biggest concern

 16:24:06 <smoser> list is at http://status.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/kernel-bugs/reports/rls-p-tracking-bugs.html

 16:24:08 <Daviey> right

 16:24:15 <roaksoax> hopefiully by the end of this week we will see something shiny without cobbler

 16:24:31 <roaksoax> other than that, I'm doing weekly uploads of MAAS for precise in testing PPA

 16:24:45 <roaksoax> this week's will contain the DNS stuff ready

 16:25:03 <roaksoax> ah, and before I forget, python-celery in Precise is in universe, and we will need it in main

 16:25:11 <roaksoax> before we can successfully SRU MAAS

 16:25:37 <jamespage> roaksoax, I'm not convinced that this is going to make the cutoffs for 12.04.1

 16:26:15 <jamespage> that seems to be alot todo; and its not that far away....

 16:26:37 <jamespage> anyway

 16:26:49 <jamespage> anything else for 12.04.1?

 16:27:00 <jamespage> ...

 16:27:03 <jamespage> ..

 16:27:04 <roaksoax> it is indeed a lot to do

 16:27:08 <jamespage> .

 16:27:39 <jamespage> #topic Ubuntu Server Team Events

 16:27:51 <jamespage> anything anyone wants to raise re events?

 16:28:26 <arosales> nothing on the juju front in the next couple of weeks

 16:28:50 <arosales> CloudOpen at the end of August is the next on the list

 16:29:30 <jamespage> great

 16:29:31 <jamespage> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (hggdh)

 16:29:36 <jamespage> hggdh - around?

 16:30:07 <jamespage> mmm - maybe not - is adam_g around? maybe he could give us an update on Openstack CI activities?

 16:30:38 <jamespage> nope - OK moving on then

 16:30:43 <Daviey> jamespage: adam_g wanted a few of us to have a separate chat.. probably a little detailed for here.

 16:30:51 <jamespage> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb)

 16:31:02 * Daviey broadsides smb with bug 1031090.

 16:31:02 <jamespage> smb - your are on

 16:31:03 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1031090 in linux (Ubuntu) "kvm_intel not loadable in a quantal guest" [Undecided,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1031090

 16:31:10 <jamespage> yeah - that one....

 16:31:25 * smb totally forgot about the meeting start

 16:31:38 <smb> Daviey, its a bug...

 16:32:01 <Daviey> smb: is it fixed :)

 16:32:04 <smb> Daviey, loading kvm module in a guest???

 16:32:25 <jamespage> working in precise apparently

 16:32:26 <Daviey> smb: nested kvm

 16:33:24 <jamespage> smb - did you have anything else for today

 16:33:26 <jamespage> ?

 16:33:27 <smb> There might be more info in dmesg...

 16:33:33 <smb> jamespage, No not really

 16:33:35 <Daviey> smb: dmesg is silent

 16:33:35 <smb> sorry

 16:34:06 <jamespage> smb, np - I think that bug is pretty important as its blocking how the security team test openstack stuff...

 16:34:19 <jamespage> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions regarding Ubuntu ARM Server (rbasak)

 16:34:23 <rbasak> Calxeda ECX-1000 support is in precise-proposed. It should hit precise-updates in a few days.

 16:34:26 <rbasak> Any questions for me?

 16:34:35 <zul> ecx-1000?

 16:34:46 <rbasak> That's the official name for highbank I think

 16:34:50 <zul> ah ok

 16:35:19 <Daviey> rbasak: so.. was talking with apw yesterday about including the device tree for qemu usage

 16:35:35 <Daviey> hopefully that should be included in the next precise kernel aswell

 16:35:49 <rbasak> current kernels look like this: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1121679/

 16:36:01 <rbasak> Not sure what version that change will/has go/gone into

 16:36:08 <Daviey> rbasak: not landed yet

 16:36:11 <rbasak> OK

 16:37:05 <rbasak> Proposed installer images for highbank are here: http://ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-ports/dists/precise-proposed/main/installer-armhf/current/images/highbank/netboot/
