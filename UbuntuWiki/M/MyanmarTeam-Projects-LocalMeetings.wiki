== Ubuntu-MM Local Meetings ==

In <nowiki>[[MyanmarTeam-Yangon|Yangon]]</nowiki>, we've been having social gatherings on a quarterly basis.  <nowiki>[[kokoye2007|Ko Ko Ye`]]</nowiki> proposing that we hold technical and translational gatherings monthly in the two months between each quarterly social gathering.

Here are the current suggestions about what the meetings would look like:
* Location:
** family-friendly venue (i.e. not a pub,beer station or Club)
** convenient location (central, or perhaps rotating through different regions)
** close to public transport
** easy access to coffee/food (or at least facilities to prepare such)
** free/very cheap wireless Internet access
** preferably a local Ubuntu mirror
* Activities:
** install-fests
** share problems or challenges and try to solve them together
** informal technical talks about things we're working on
** accessible to all levels of technical expertise (i.e. newbie friendly)
** open to potential Ubuntu users as well as actual Ubuntu users
** log our actions on IRC and/or wiki
