== Main Inclusion Report for kubuntu-firefox-installer ==

=== Requirements ===

# ''Availability:'' <nowiki>[[http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/k/kubuntu-firefox-installer]]</nowiki>; available for all supported architectures
# ''Rationale:''
** Kubuntu can't/doesn't want to ship Firefox by default, yet it is a major brand and renders mostly better than Konqueror. It is believed that a user would look for Firefox (considering they know what it is) in the menu. In order to provide them a way to easily obtain Firefox the kubuntu-firefox-installer adds a menu entry and provides a very simple application to install Firefox.
