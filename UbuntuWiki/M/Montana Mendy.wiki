=== Montana Mendy ===

'''Montana Mendy''' (born June 26, 1990) is a American software engineer who currently holds several board of director positions at small grade startups in the San Francisco, Bay Area (South of Market in particular). Montana first gained notoriety particularly for submitting various "<nowiki>[[Kernel]]</nowiki> patches" at such a young age (15) that solved a lot of wireless issues as well as submitting some of the first fixes to help solve the "ndiswrapper" issues that were occurring in late 2008. 

=== Notoriety in 2008 ===

Montana gained some universal attention in the Linux/Tech community by releasing 2 <nowiki>[[kernel]]</nowiki> patches, a ndiswrapper patch, a <nowiki>[[CompizFusion]]</nowiki> and an <nowiki>[[Emerald]]</nowiki> patch all in one big release which he called '''The Fab Five Tar Ball'''. Montana was interviewed by some of the high ups at Ubuntu, and was commended on his work and commitment to the Linux community. 

=== Ndiswrapper issues in 2008 ===

In early 2008 there were some issues regarding installing drivers via <nowiki>[[Ndiswrapper]]</nowiki> on some of the LTS releases of Ubuntu Linux. Particularly the Broadcom chipsets were the culprit, for weeks people went without wireless and were trying numerous fixes, none of which seemed to solve the issue. On '''March 9th, 2008''' Montana released the first patch, which resolved the issue completely. One of the threads he wrote for the ndiswrapper fix can be found <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1233770&highlight=|here.]]</nowiki>
 
=== Startups ===

Montana has been apart of various different startups in the San Francisco, Bay Area. Some of the notable startups he was apart of (submitted no code, just conversed/gave ideas in early stages) were <nowiki>[[http://www.path.com|Path]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[http://involvio.com|Involvio]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[http://www.fabsie.com|Fabsie]]</nowiki>. Montana is currently working on <nowiki>[[http://www.getprowl.com|Prowl]]</nowiki> which is a hybrid between various startups, Montana is currently providing open source code to the public and still keeps some proprietary with his latest project.

His current startup <nowiki>[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prowl_application|Prowl]]</nowiki>, Montana has told the Linux community he is working with Arduino, and plans to release the code for the drivers he writes. Montana currently has said, in a thread discussing music oriented startups that 'Prowl isn't competing with these companies, we are expanding the idea of discovering music'.

In a recent thread on the Ubuntu/Gentoo forums, Montana has confirmed a WebOS version of his application, Prowl. Montana has stated "There will be no version of Prowl for the Windows Phone"

For the webapp, Prowl is mostly using Django, and Adobe Flex, storage will be using Amazon S3. Web App is set to release in 2014.

=== Personal life ===

Mendy was born in Hayward, California and lived in Newport Beach, California before his family moved to Fremont, California where he spent most of his time learning how to program in Pascal. He dropped out of High School at the 11th grade in the hopes of finding a career in tech, within this, he found '''The Ubuntu Forums'''. With the knowledge of reading, and the forums, he was able to make his first tech startup at the age of only 16.
