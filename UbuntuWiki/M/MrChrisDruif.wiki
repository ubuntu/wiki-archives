=== About Me ===

When I joined the community in nov-dec of 2010 I wouldn't have thought that I would get so involved with so many projects. I planned on staying a bit in the background, only to help others when I absolutely was sure about an answer. Learning and helping as I went I got involved with the <nowiki>[[BeginnersTeam]]</nowiki>.

I was also interested in the lightweight (now) <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DerivativeTeam/Derivatives#Recognised_Flavors | recognized flavour]]</nowiki> of Ubuntu called <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lubuntu | Lubuntu]]</nowiki>. In jan-feb 2011 I joined <nowiki>[[http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#lubuntu,#lubuntu-offtopic | #lubuntu and #lubuntu-offtopic]]</nowiki> channels to get to know the team and help where possible.

Now after two years I'm starting to feel really confident about my abilities as wiki-admin and start to pursuit a new direction. If you know a good place to get started on Artwork and Design for Ubuntu/Linux: feel free to contact me. 

The 19th of April 2012 will always be a special day for me. Not only because I became accepted as <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-doc-wiki-admins/+members#active | Wiki Admin]]</nowiki> but I also became an <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-news-team/2012-April/001545.html | Ubuntu Member]]</nowiki>. A day to remember, for sure.

=== Contributions ===

I've started contributing to Ubuntu since I joined the Beginners Team but it became more serious after I joined the Lubuntu team. As time progressed I became more knowledgeable about Ubuntu, Lubuntu and using the moinmoin wiki with all it's features. As such I've become the Team Leader for the Wiki section of Lubuntu. Because my contributions are already quite reasonable and will only become more did me decide to move it to it's own sub-page, which can be found <nowiki>[[Contributions | here]]</nowiki>.

=== Future Goals ===

I'm on my way to mastering the moinmoin wiki and as my next "challenge" I've decided to pursuit something I loved to do as a kid: Design/Drawing! For starters I've decided to first input my thoughts on the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-design | Ubuntu Design team]]</nowiki>, as well the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-tv | TV team]]</nowiki> and the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-phone | Phone team]]</nowiki>. I've also joined the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~lubuntu-art | Lubuntu Artwork]]</nowiki> group.

=== Testimonials ===

Because a lot of people were putting up testimonials ('''thanks everyone!''') I've moved them to it's own sub-page, which can be found <nowiki>[[Testimonials | here]]</nowiki>
