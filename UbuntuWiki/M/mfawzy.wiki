=== About Me ===
My name is Mahmoud Fawzy, I've been a fan the open source culture since late 2008, when I saw Hardy Heron (Ubuntu 8.04) in TV show which started my open source journey. given that Egypt has a somehow high software piracy rate (at least for households) I soon adopted the cause of spreading FLOSS culture to whoever I could access :). I found Ubuntu-Eg Loco Team and joined it with a big dream to educate every Egyptian computer user about FLOSS :)

=== Contributions ===
 {*}  Gave a number of presentations about FOSS culture and introduction to linux among Ubuntu-Eg Loco team's events

 {*}  starting a <nowiki>[[http://unimasr.com/community/viewforum.php?f=568| linux sub forum]]</nowiki> in the online student community for my college (Faculty of Engineering Cairo University)

 {*}  Held two Introduction to Linux workshops with the help of some colleagues

 {*}  Co-founded <nowiki>[[http://ishare-eg.org|IShare student community]]</nowiki> which was mainly targeted at spreading FOSS culture among the students of the Faculty of Engineering, Cairo University.

=== Future Goals ===

My ultimate goal for FLOSS in Egypt is to get it officially adopted by the governmental sector and having it taught in schools and universities, instead of feeding the brains of our youngsters with technologies that restricts their abilities to learn or create! However, I think that can be only achieved if we managed to get the following ones done

 {*}  Familiarizing the non-technical Egyptian community with FLOSS (so that they no longer feel its alien to them) 

 {*}  Attracting more advocates among different sectors of our community

 {*}  Attracting more of them to use Open Source software in work as well as they do at home (specifically, I mean non-tech-savvy jobs)
