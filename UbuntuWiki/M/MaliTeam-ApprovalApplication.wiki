=== Key Details ===

* '''Date''' - December 6^th^
* '''Team Contact''' - Renaud Gaudin <reg@nurv.fr>
* '''Membership''' - 9 on Launchpad ; 4 fellows not registered on LP.
* '''Mailing List''' - ubuntu-ml on lists.ubuntu.com
* '''IRC''' - #ubuntu-ml on Freenode

'''Nota Bene:''' Mali is one of the worst country in terms of Internet access so we don't use much the Internet to communicate inside the LoCo. We mostly use phone or we meet and discuss. That's why we are building an offline Ubuntu repository and why the mailing-list and IRC are not used much.

Also, we don't do any translation work because Mali is french-speaking and Ubuntu-fr does a really good job.
