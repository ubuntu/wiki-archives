=== Summary ===
Seek out other groups in Minnesota with computing-related focus and communicate this group's existence to them and offer an invitation for collaboration where appropriate.

=== Rationale ===

A lot of people in Minnesota still aren't aware of our group, but might be excited about it if they did.  Also, communicating with other groups in the state will foster relationships that will be helpful for working together on common goals.  For instance, at a face-to-face meeting with members of TCLUG a few months back, members were interested in our LoCo but not yet aware.

=== Implementation ===

==== Communication Standards ====

We should have a pre-written script of sorts written to save people time and effort and to make sure we have a consistent message.  This would apply to e-mail, letter, or phone contact.

=== Unresolved issues ===

This should highlight any issues that should be addressed in further specifications, and not problems with the specification itself; since any specification with problems cannot be approved.

=== BoF agenda and discussion ===

Proposed:
*** Frequent the #tclug channel on IRC and promote our LoCo
*** Join TCLUG and stay informed about local Linux activities
*** Investigate possibilities for joint events (both online and in person)
*** Recommend LoCo members to join their respective LUGs in Minnesota
*** Search for non-Linux computing groups to contact and promote our LoCo to
