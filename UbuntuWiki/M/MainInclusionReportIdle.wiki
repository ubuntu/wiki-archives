There's some confusion about idle not beeing available in main. It's not the ideal IDE for python, but the one people know from standard python installations.

Other Python IDEs in universe are spe (wxwidgets), drpython (wxwidgets), boa-constructor (wxwidgets), eric (qt), eclipse-pydev still doesn't build from source.
