16:45:58 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 902951 in linux (Ubuntu) "CONFIG_VIRTIO_BLK shouldnt be a module" [Medium,Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/902951
16:46:04 <smb> Daviey, Looking there seems like a iommu thing
16:46:32 <smb> Daviey, VIRTIO_BLK will be built in in precise
16:46:39 <smb> Need to update the bug probably
16:46:44 <Daviey> neat
16:47:08 <Daviey> The only other issue with the kernel seems to be odd sound on my laptop :).. but OT here. :)
16:47:19 <Daviey> i'm done, thanks smb
16:47:28 <roaksoax> alright, I guess we can move on
16:47:48 <roaksoax> [TOPIC] Weekly Updates & Questions regarding Ubuntu ARM Server (rbasak)
16:47:55 <roaksoax> rbasak: your turn
16:48:23 <rbasak> So I spoke to the arm team last week
16:48:31 <rbasak> the consensus is that I will bridge the two meetings
16:48:40 <Daviey> \o/
16:49:01 <rbasak> precise is working on armhf for me now, juju still a bit broken
16:49:16 <Daviey> rbasak: have bugs?
16:49:41 <rbasak> I filed bug 917664 earlier
16:49:42 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 917664 in juju (Ubuntu) "juju lxc on precise is hardcoded to oneiric" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/917664
16:50:10 <rbasak> we're almost certainly going to be going for armhf on server
16:50:15 <Daviey> rbasak: do you think this is importiant to release of precise?
16:50:20 <rbasak> yes
16:50:46 * Daviey adds it to the list.
16:50:46 <smoser> rbasak, so we decided i believe that there is no point in doing cloud-images for armel, right?
16:51:16 <rbasak> Yes, that's my understanding. Is there any reason we need them that I'm missing?
16:51:16 <smoser> we should have a bug for "replace armel with armhf(??) for arch of cloud-images" then
16:51:25 <smoser> i can't think of any
16:51:32 <lynxman> Daviey: Sorry was trapped in the juju world :) The new upstream snapshot is ready, packaged, branched and pending your review
16:51:38 <jamespage> ls
16:52:10 <SpamapS> rbasak: I believe that juju bug is actually already reported and assigned to hazmat...
16:52:14 <Daviey> lynxman: ah, linky?
16:52:34 <SpamapS> rbasak: bug 914392
16:52:35 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 914392 in juju "LXC local provider does not respect 'series' (only installs oneiric)" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/914392
16:52:53 <lynxman> Daviey: https://code.launchpad.net/~lynxman/ubuntu/precise/ipxe/newsnapshot
16:53:03 <rbasak> SpamapS: agreed, thanks!
16:53:05 <Daviey> lynxman: thanks.
16:53:40 <Daviey> anything else?
16:53:46 <SpamapS> rbasak: marked as dupe
16:53:55 <rbasak> thanks SpamapS
16:53:56 <SpamapS> Daviey: ^^ please adjust accordingly
16:54:05 <rbasak> I'm done, I'll start keeping a proper list for future meetings
16:54:16 <roaksoax> ok then I guess we can move on if there's nothing else for rbasak
16:54:21 <Daviey> SpamapS: thanks
16:54:35 <roaksoax> [TOPIC] Weekly Updates & Questions from the Ubuntu Community
16:55:01 <roaksoax> anyone from the community has anything to bring to the table?
16:55:11 * ScottK is working with lamont on postfix updates.
16:55:25 <Daviey> ScottK: Awesome!!
16:55:33 <Daviey> ScottK: anything interesting in the pipelines?
16:55:36 <ScottK> He's doing 2.8.7 for precise and then I'll do microversion updates for natty/oneric.
16:55:43 <Daviey> \o/
16:55:44 <ScottK> This is just bug fixes.
16:55:53 <ScottK> Then backports for Lucid/Maverick.
16:56:00 <ScottK> But 2.9.0 is close.
16:56:22 <ScottK> That, interestingly enough, will have an optional memcached client.
16:56:24 <SpamapS> roaksoax: since I'm from the community.. I'd like to bring to the table that this particular section is rather troubling.. and that we should try to involve non-Canonical people in all sections, since we're all part of the "community"
16:56:30 <lynxman> Since it's QA time, it's worth submitting a bug for xen-tools? It says somewhere that it's being deprecated, nonetheless it's defaults are broken for creating new xen servers
16:56:35 <ScottK> SpamapS: +1
16:56:41 <lynxman> SpamapS: +1
16:57:11 <roaksoax> SpamapS: fine by me too
16:57:15 <rbasak> SpamapS: while I agree, I think it's important to give people a specific opportunity to comment! Better to have a specific agenda item than feel that there is no agenda item at all
16:57:41 <ScottK> Just change is to Other updates and questions.
16:57:45 <ScottK> is/it
16:57:47 <SpamapS> I believe this section used to be specifically updats from the Canonical "community team" and then was morphed to this.. but really, we're all at this meeting specifically to address the community as a whole.. so I see no need for this section.
16:57:58 <smb> lynxman, I am not sure I understand what you say. Maybe you could explain when I am more awake. :)
16:58:15 <roaksoax> I guess we can merge this topic with Open Discussion
16:58:20 <lynxman> smb: xen-tools generate xen images that lack the load of xenblk on startup so they always fall back to ramdisk
16:58:21 <ScottK> Yeah.
16:58:21 <SpamapS> rbasak: each agenda item is, and should be, oriented toward the community.
16:58:38 <jsalisbury> Roll Call for Ubuntu Kernel Weekly Status Meeting
16:58:41 <rbasak> SpamapS: absolutely - but is that communicated effectively at every meeting? Because this agenda item is.
16:58:45 <ScottK> roaksoax: I agree.  I thought this was a fancy name for open discussion.
16:58:48 <SpamapS> 2 minutes remaining..
16:58:58 <smb> lynxman, You know that we at least now built-in the frontend driver?
16:59:00 <SpamapS> we won't have time to finish this discussion here. Shall we defer to next week?
16:59:09 <roaksoax> ScottK: we have both at the moment :/
16:59:11 * ScottK votes SpamapS for dictator of agenda reworking.
16:59:26 <ScottK> SpamapS: JFDI.  Fix it.
16:59:36 <SpamapS> roaksoax: action please?
16:59:52 <SpamapS> And then I suppose we should wrap up.
17:00:07 <lynxman> smb: I do, this is latest oneiric, broken ):
17:00:13 <lynxman> smb: bug has been sitting ducks
17:00:14 <roaksoax> [action] Discuss merge of Open Discussion with Community update topics
17:00:14 * meetingology Discuss merge of Open Discussion with Community update topics
17:00:17 <lynxman> smb: I'll raise it later
17:00:24 <Daviey> Everyone say hello to arosales, three cheers for the new Ubuntu Server Workloads Manager.
17:00:28 <smb> lynxman, k
17:00:31 <lynxman> arosales: \o/ \o/
17:00:34 <rbasak> hip hip

17:01:46 <roaksoax> SpamapS: welcome ;)
17:01:52 * SpamapS eyes the pensive kernel team and figures we should probably get outta here while the gettin's good
