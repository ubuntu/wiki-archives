=== About Me ===

I'm a student of computer science at the <nowiki>[<nowiki>[[http://zope.hu-berlin.de/index_html-en?set_language=en&cl=en|Humboldt-University of Berlin]]</nowiki></nowiki>]. Besides my studies, I'm working at the <nowiki>[<nowiki>[[http://www.technologiestiftung-berlin.de/index.php/home/3/0#0|Technology Foundation Berlin]]</nowiki></nowiki>].

Before I started my studies, I worked a few years as a bank clerk at a medium-sized cooperative bank. Back then I started a small startup with a colleague, called <nowiki>[<nowiki>[[http://www.sethi.de/|Sethi IT Consulting]]</nowiki></nowiki>]. We're still active in developing applications for the financial sector (primarily using Lotus Notes) and offering consulting services to small and mid-sized companies of all industries.

=== Linux Experience ===

My first encounter with Linux was a Distribution by the "Linux Support Team Erlangen" back in 1996. It came with kernel 1.2.13. Needless to say, I didn't spend to much time with it, as it was too early to really work with it.

A few years later I broaden my horizon with SuSE and Debian. I did quite a few server installations, even I was still using Windows on the desktop.

=== Ubuntu Experience ===

When warty was released, I decided to start switching completly. Since 2004, Ubuntu is my operating system on the desktop. 

=== Current Work on Ubuntu ===

Primarily I'm working on
 
* <nowiki>[<nowiki>[[https://answers.launchpad.net/~thielmann/|Ubuntu Answers]]</nowiki></nowiki>], trying to solve questions
* <nowiki>[<nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/~thielmann/|Ubuntu Bugtracker]]</nowiki></nowiki>], helping to triage bugs

=== Future Work on Ubuntu and Community Goals ===

There a few goals I'd like to achive within this year

* Reorganize and enhance Bug Helpers and Support wiki pages to ease efficient support and bug triage
* Provide at least one package for the universe repository
