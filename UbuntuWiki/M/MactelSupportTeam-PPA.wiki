=== Introduction ===

This page is about how to enable the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MactelSupportTeam|MactelSupport]]</nowiki> repository in the package manager.

=== Installation ===

Several Apple-specific packages are available in the Mactel Support Repository (the mactel ppa).
The packages mostly work for both Hardy and Intrepid, although some packages are only useful for a particular release.

To add the ppa to your apt list use:
<pre>
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mactel-support
</pre>

After adding the ppa, the package list needs to be updated:
<pre>
sudo apt-get update
</pre>

The Package Manager now also includes packages from the Mactel PPA.

You can also access many of these packages through launchpad if you want to download only one of the packages without updating other items:
https://launchpad.net/~mactel-support/+archive

=== Packages ===

These are the currently supported packages:
