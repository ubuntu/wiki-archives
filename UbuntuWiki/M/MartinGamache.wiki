=== About me ===
I'm kind of a jack-of-all-trades, living and working in Montréal since 1992.  I've been recently working as a research assistant (in sociology) in recent years, but I'm planning a return to process revision in the public sector.  I also worked as translator and teacher, even as IT technician. 

I have discovered open-source software in february 2006, and since then, have advocated its use.

I can be reached (most of the time) at my gmail adress Martin dot Gamache at gmail dot com .

 
'''Teams'''
* QuebecTeam since December 30th, 2009

=== Plans & vision for Ubuntu ===

Although I do think the beauty of Linux is in its diversity, I see Ubuntu as a more user-friendly distribution, and its community as being more open to newbies and non-computer-proficient users.  Sharing and supporting new users is one of the defining traits of this community, and I hope to contribute to that.

I will continue to advocate the use of open-source software, and in my upcoming job, I intend to do presentations in order to encourage its use in the public sector.
