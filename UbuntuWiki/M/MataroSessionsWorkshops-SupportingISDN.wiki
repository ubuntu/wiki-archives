__TOC__

== ISDN BOF ==

=== Drivers ===
* hisax (old-isdn, no-longer supported by upstream, ipppd, lots of work to configure it)
* mISDN (new-kernel-isdn, easier to configure, use pppd)
* CAPI-Drivers (non-free, supported by AVM, old ELA, easier to configure, use pppd)

=== Warty ===

* basicly no support
* only hisax and mISDN drivers that sometimes conflict when being loaded
* important packages not on the CD

=== Hoary ===

* put the needed packages (pppdcapiplugin, misdn-utils, isdnactivecards) on the cd (see ShipSeedProposals)
* modify gnome-system-tools (mvo)
* make a package for the CAPI drivers (need letter), put into linux-restricted-modules (doko)
* kisdn: very nice isdn package(?) someone should look at this (mvo)
* split out capi-utils isdnactivecards package (doko)
* find out about what cards are supported by hisax and not by mISDN and only compile those HisaxButNotMISDN
    - provide a package with the needed support for older hisax hardware(?) 
    - don't build with the drivers that are not needed

=== Problems ===

* Faxing and ISDN: only hyla-fax supports it (sending/recv) and hyla-fax is not going into main
* old hisax driver does not support hotplug/udev, unmaintained upstream
* mISDN: after blacklisting hisax_fcpcipnp,hisax,hisax_isac,hisax_st5481
   mISDN seems to be only loaded only automatically when mISDN_capi is loaded
   before?
