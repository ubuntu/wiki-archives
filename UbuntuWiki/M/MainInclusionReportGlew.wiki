__TOC__

== Main inclusion report for glew ==

=== Requirements ===

1. ''Availability:'' `http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/g/glew/`, compiled on all architectures.

2. ''Rationale:'' New build-dependency of `rss-glx`.

3. ''Security:''
* No CVEs.
* No secunia record.

4. ''QA:''
* Bugs: Two "important" Debian bugs: one is pre-modular-X and seems irrelevant for Ubuntu, while the other is hppa-specific. One wishlist bug requesting a newer upstream version.

5. ''Standards compliance:''
* Standard `debhelper` v4 packaging.
* FHS met.
* Missing manual page for `glewinfo`; runtime library package name should probably be `libglew1.3` to match the SONAME. Debian package policy otherwise met.
