__TOC__

== Availability ==
The package is available in universe

== Rationale ==
mms:// URL's are in widespread use and providing this functionality will be a great benifit for many users wanting to access online radio stations and video broadcasts.
libmms provides the foundation needed for e.g. gstreamer to provide support for mms:// style URL's, and since gstreamer is in main, libmms has to be in main too.

== Security ==
No known issues

== QA ==
The upstream source is almost a year old. This does not signify a dead developer base, but rather that the code does what it is supposed to. I know this because I am part of the upstream developer base.

== Standards compliance ==
The package meets FHS requirements and complies with the Debian policy.

== Dependencies ==
libmms introduces no new dependencies

== Reviewers ==
MartinPitt: approved
