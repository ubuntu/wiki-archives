== Main Inclusion Report for pidgin-otr ==

=== Requirements ===

 1. ''Availability:'' http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/p/pidgin-otr, available for all supported architectures
 2. ''Rationale:''
** The package allows to have private (encrypted, authenticated and deniable) IM conversations in a protocol-indipendent way.
** Given that pidgin is ubuntu's default IM client, this would make every ubuntu user able to have secure conversations in an easy way.
** There are no other packages providing this functionality in main.
 3. ''Security:''
** No CVE entries.
** No Secunia history.
** No binaries running as root or suid/sgid.
** Does not open any port.
 4. ''Quality assurance:''
** Only needs minimal configuration.
** Self-documenting: the first time you start a conversation a pop-up appears explaining what's going on.
** No critical bugs in Debian.
** Active upstream.
 5. ''Standards compliance:'' 
** Meets the <nowiki>[[http://www.pathname.com/fhs/|FHS]]</nowiki>.
 6. ''Dependencies:''
** pidgin libgcrypt11, libgpg-error: already in main.
** libotr2: in universe, has been proposed for main inclusion.
