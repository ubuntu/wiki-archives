=== Details ===

An InstallFest, or Installation Festival, which we refer to as an "Exploration Ubuntu", is an event held for people to see, try, and get Ubuntu for themselves. Anyone is free to bring in their own computer or hard drive to have Ubuntu installed on it, or they may just come to see Ubuntu on the many demo machines and get a chance to experience it for themselves.

=== Volunteers ===

''Please sign up here if you wish to volunteer to help out at the installation festival, not just geeks are required. We would like all volunteers to wear some form of Ubuntu apparel and Mike will have t-shirts available for anyone who hasn't already got one. We'll also be making up some ID badges so everyone who is officially helping will be known and registered such that we can avoid problems since we have to deal with liability etc.''

If you can come early to help setup the event, please add "Setup" after your name. If you can stay late, add "teardown". About 5 people will be sufficient for each crew. Plan to arrive by 8:30 for setup and stay until 17:30 (5:30pm) for teardown.
