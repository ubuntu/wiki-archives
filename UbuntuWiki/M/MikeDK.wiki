Hi! have used Ubuntu since the breezy badger. and getting more involved with some translating HP pavilion dv9232eu

The HP's running Studio Ibex,got 3 THinkpads now also, my E570 running the crunchbanglinux dist thats build on ubuntu minimal cd, my R51 with intel chipset and intel 855GME graphics running Ubuntu Karmic testing state. my X40 also with the intel 855GME graphics running Ubuntu Jaunty.

Mostly sitting on the irc-channel #ubuntu-dk and our offtopic-channel #ubuntu-dk-snak under irc.freenode.net
i've started on some minor translating stuff, and looking forward to get more involved in that.

Im very happy using Ubuntu, my new Desktop machine is in a really nice CM Stacker tower, with amd X2 4400 cpu and a Geforce 9500GT 1GB memory. 2GB kingston memory. 160GB ATA hdd.

Just bought a R52 thinkpad, and really anxious to get to test it with karmic as i know there some issues on the old ati cards, so currently i have almost 6 laptops running ubuntu. make that 7 laptops, include a HP tx1345eo.

Kind Regards MikeDK
