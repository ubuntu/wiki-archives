== Introduction ==
An InstallFest, or Installation Festival, which we refer to as an "Exploration Ubuntu", is an event held for people to see, try, and get Ubuntu for themselves. Anyone is free to bring in their own computer or hard drive to have Ubuntu installed on it, or they may just come to see Ubuntu on the many demo machines and get a chance to experience it for themselves.
