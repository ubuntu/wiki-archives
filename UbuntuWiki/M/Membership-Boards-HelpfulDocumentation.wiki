Here's some helpful things for the Ubuntu Membership Review Boards:

* The Membership Board's <nowiki>[[Quorum|Quorum requirements]]</nowiki>
* An <nowiki>[[IntroScript|introduction script]]</nowiki> (not THAT kind of script) to use at the beginning of the meetings so everyone knows what is expected.
* <nowiki>[[AlwaysAskQuestions|Questions to always be asked]]</nowiki> of every candidate.
* Some <nowiki>[[CongratulationsScript|congratulatory text]]</nowiki> to paste outlining where to find the perks for successful applicants.
* An outline of the <nowiki>[[PostMeetingEmail|post-meeting email]]</nowiki> that gets sent out.
* The <nowiki>[[Membership-Rejoining|rejoining process]]</nowiki> for those who would like to continue their membership but it has expired.

Some suggestions for other pages documenting correct procedure:
