== Wiki ==

Over the past two years I've work on varies bits of the Ubuntu wiki, starting very small on <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BackupYourSystem | Backup Your System]]</nowiki> by cleaning up the table on there. It is now far easier to add another row to that table.

After that I've done a lot of systematic renaming over on the <nowiki>[[BeginnersTeam | Ubuntu Beginners Team]]</nowiki>. When they decided to change the naming from Padawan to Apprentice, Master to Guide to name a few examples. Also updating the banner to the correct date and combining two separate table lines into a single one.

After that I started working on the <nowiki>[[Lubuntu]]</nowiki> wiki pages. First I generalized the <nowiki>[[Lubuntu-Testing | Testing]]</nowiki> page during the Natty release cycle. Around the Oneiric release I had some personal issues to deal with so no mayor changes anywhere. After the summer I got back to editing and since January 2012 I've become the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~lubuntu-wiki-docs | Wiki/Docs Team Leader of Lubuntu]]</nowiki>. Since then things still continued it's course.

One of the more mayor operations I've completed is the moving of [[Lubuntu/DocumentationHelp | [Wiki] Documentation/Help]] to it's (permanent?) new home [[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/Documentation | [Help] Documentation/Help]].

== Ubuntu Weekly Newsletter ==

I've also started helping the <nowiki>[[UbuntuWeeklyNewsletter | Ubuntu Weekly Newsletter team]]</nowiki> starting with <nowiki>[[UbuntuWeeklyNewsletter-Issue243 | Issue 243]]</nowiki>. I have absolutely no idea why I started helping with that edition, but one of my objectives was to get more awareness for <nowiki>[[Lubuntu]]</nowiki> by adding their weekly meeting to <nowiki>[[UbuntuWeeklyNewsletter | the UWN]]</nowiki>. That resulted in some heated <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-news-team/2011-December/001445.html | responses]]</nowiki> which I can't trace all back to mailing-list archives. But the end result was a new section in the UWN starting with <nowiki>[[UbuntuWeeklyNewsletter-Issue244#Weekly_Official_Ubuntu_Derivative_Distributions_Team_Meetings | the wrong name]]</nowiki> but fixed <nowiki>[[UbuntuWeeklyNewsletter-Issue245#Weekly_Official_Ubuntu_Flavors_Team_Meetings | the next issue]]</nowiki>. Since then I've tried to update the links to the meetings every week and write summaries when I've got time, but the team does an amazing job even without me.

== IRC ==

I once started out helping people on IRC. However I noticed that wasn't my strongest point, so I decided to ditch that in favour helping different teams like <nowiki>[[Lubuntu]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[UbuntuWeeklyNewsletter | UWN]]</nowiki>. However I still reside on a few support channel and aid whenever possible.

The second reason I use IRC is to keep in touch which the teams I'm in and have direct conversations instead of waiting for email responses to arrive. So you'll find me a lot on the different Ubuntu related channel for the different teams. How to get in touch with me I revert you to my <nowiki>[[MrChrisDruif | wiki-home]]</nowiki>.

I've also become the co-Team-leader of the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~lubuntu-irc-ops | Lubuntu IRC OP's team]]</nowiki> to help keep <nowiki>[[http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#lubuntu,#lubuntu-offtopic | #lubuntu and #lubuntu-offtopic]]</nowiki> channels clean and free from (verbal) violence.
