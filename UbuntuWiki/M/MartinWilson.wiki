=== About ===
Hi!  I'm Martin Wilson.  I'm an IB Senior and will be going to the University of Florida next year to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering.  My first Linux distro was Mandrake in 2001.  Since then, I've been messing around in and out with different distros.  I've tried Mandrake, Fedora Core, Gentoo, and finally Ubuntu.  Gentoo was a very powerful distribution and I had it for quite a long time.  However, about a month ago I switched over to Ubuntu and have been very impressed. I don't plan on looking around any more!

=== What I've Done for Ubuntu ===
I've only been here for a little while but I've tried to help as much as possible.
 {*} I have helped as much as possible on the Ubuntu Forums.  I try to at least get a couple of unanswered posts answered each day.

 {*} I have joined the Ubuntu-Florida LoCo.  I am extremely excited about the team, we have some exciting events coming up.

 {*} I have a launchpad account and have joined the Bug Squad.

=== Other Personal Accomplishments and Hobbies ===
I am a modder and an overclocking enthusiast (neither are cheap hobbies though).  Some things I have done in this category:
* I had a water-cooled Athlon64 at about a .9 gigahertz overclock for a while.
* I painted my case in a blue mirror-finish color scheme.  I also plan to engrave some designs in the acrylic window.
* I have assembled two computers, mine and one for my parents.

I also like to do small electronics work.  I have assembled a CMoy amp and done some other small changes/fixes around the house.

=== Goals ===
There are a few things I would like to do with Ubuntu and overall:
 <nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/UbuntuGrey.png]]</nowiki> Answer more unanswered posts and in the process learn more.

 <nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/UbuntuGrey.png]]</nowiki> Help the FloridaTeam become official and in the process help spread knowledge and Ubuntu

 <nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/UbuntuGrey.png]]</nowiki> Learn more about helping with bugs and develop a rhythm of triaging at least 1 a month

 <nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/UbuntuGrey.png]]</nowiki> Work towards my Bachelor's degree and ultimately towards grad school and a career in designing small electronics
