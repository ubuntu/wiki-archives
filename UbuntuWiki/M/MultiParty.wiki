== Multi-Party Tests ==

=== 1. Create Multi-Party Call ===

==== Purpose ====
This test case verifies that we can create a multiparty call.

==== Requirements ====
Activate the multi-conference service for the subscriber account/line used by the touch device. You usually need to contact your provider for this.

==== Steps ====
* dial-number A
** Verify that we can communicate with A
* dial-number B
** Verify that there is a tone at A ( see note ) indicating that the call is on hold
** Verify that we can communicate with B
* create-multiparty
** Verify that we can communicate simultaneously with A and B
* list-calls
** Verify the both calls are ''active'' and that each have ''MultiParty=1''.

'''Note''' - a tone indicating that a call has been put on hold is an operator-specific feature.  For instance, no tones are generated by AT&T or RCN in the US.

=== 2. Split Multi-Party Call ===

==== Purpose ====
This test case verifies that we can split an established multi-party call.

==== Requirements ====
Activate the call hold/waiting and multi-conference services for the subscriber account/line used by the touch device.

==== Steps ====
* dial-number A
** Verify that we can communicate with A
* dial-number B
** Verify that there is a tone at A ( see note ) indicating that the call has been put on hold
** Verify that we can communicate with B
* create-multiparty
** Verify that we can communicate simultaneously with A and B
* list-calls
** Verify the both calls are ''active'' and that each have ''MultiParty=1''.
* private-chat [modem]/voicecall01
** Verify that we can communicate with A
** Verify that there is a tone at B indicating that the call has been put on hold
* list-calls
** Verify the call A is ''active'', call B is ''held'', and that each have ''MultiParty=0''.

'''Note''' - a tone indicating that a call has been put on hold is an operator-specific feature.  For instance, no tones are generated by AT&T or RCN in the US.
