   04:10 Kamion       let's start
   04:10 Kamion       we have no locoteam business this meeting
   04:10 Kamion       and a bunch of member candidates
   04:10 Seveas       and some other business
   04:11 MarioMeyer   :)
   04:11 Seveas       ah, no ther business
   04:11 Kamion       none on the agenda
   04:11 Kamion       AnandaPutra: here?
   04:11 Kamion       FRNSantos: here?
   04:11 Kamion       LorenzoSfarra: here?
   04:11 ubuntuser_ba yes, I am FRNSantos
   04:11 twilight     yes
   04:11 twilight     <- LorenzoSfarra
   04:11 Seveas       ubuntuser_ba, hi there
   04:11 mako         twilight: ok.. hold on.. lets deal with
                      ubuntuser_ba  first
   04:12 ubuntuser_ba ok
   04:12 Seveas       ubuntuser_ba, give us the 3-liner please :)
   04:12 twilight     mako, no problem
                      My name is Fabio Nogueira, a 30 year-old Brazilian
                      living in Salvador, Bahia.  I currently work for the
   04:12 ubuntuser_ba State Justice Court as a computer technician and as an
                      assistant to the system administrator, mostly handling
                      the support of users and hardware.
   04:12 Seveas       that's line 1 :)
   04:12 raphink      ;)
                      My relationship with Linux started with a few Live CDs
   04:12 ubuntuser_ba (Kurumin, Kalango, etc), eventually moving through
                      Fedora and Mandrake.  It was only after I tried Ubuntu
                      that I first experienced true nirvana!
   04:13 OgMaciel     hehe
                      This feeling has stayed with me now... the entire
                      "Ubuntu way of life" appeals to me and I want to share
   04:13 ubuntuser_ba it with the whole world.  I often find myself
                      "spreading the word" at every place I go to...
                      supermarkets, butcher shop, etc..
   04:13 ubuntuser_ba and...
                      I strongly believe that I'm ready and willing to take
   04:13 ubuntuser_ba the responsibility that comes with being part of the
                      Ubuntu Family!
   === Kamion sees that ubuntuser_ba has the usual translator Enormous Karma
   Of Doom in launchpad
   04:14 OgMaciel     Kamion hehehe
   04:14 raphink      :)
   04:14 jsgotangco   heh
   04:14 MarioMeyer   :P
   === mako nods to Kamion
   04:14 Kamion       how many are there on the pt_BR translation team now?
   04:14 mako         OgMaciel: thanks for the testimonial
   04:14 mako         it's helpful
   04:14 OgMaciel     here
   04:14 OgMaciel     mako my pleasure to endorse him
   04:14 MarioMeyer   about 62, Kamion
   04:14 mako         wow
   04:14 lucasd       OgMaciel, back :)
   04:15 Seveas       that's... a LOT
   04:15 jsgotangco   wow
   04:15 Kamion       *62*?
   04:15 OgMaciel     and many more awaiting approval
   04:15 Seveas       how many active members?
   04:15 MarioMeyer   but not all active
   04:15 Madpilot     they're busy down in BR!
   04:15 OgMaciel     Seveas 62
   04:15 Kamion       how do you coordinate that many people?
   04:15 Seveas       are they alla ctively translating?
   04:15 OgMaciel     Kamion we sometimes hold "sweepstakes"... hehehe
   04:15 MarioMeyer   we are planing some "application" process
   04:15 MarioMeyer   like tutoring the new ones..
   === lucasd = Lucas Duailibe.. Here :)
                      I suppose translation work divides up easily enough,
   04:16 Kamion       but you still have to ensure consistency of vocabulary
                      and stuff
   04:16 OgMaciel     Seveas somewhat
   04:16 mako         MarioMeyer: lightweight with support for those that
                      need it or want it is always good
   04:16 MarioMeyer   i say we have about 10 to 15 active translators
   04:16 OgMaciel     Kamion absolutely
   04:16 Seveas       Kamion, exactly, we kicked out lots of people in -nl
                      that made crap translations
   04:16 ubuntuser_ba and bad translations....
   04:17 Treenaks     and just plain wrong translations
   === Treenaks Martijn van de Streek, btw
   04:17 MarioMeyer   yeah.. ubuntuser_ba has been doing a LOT of revisions
                      of bad translations
   04:17 MarioMeyer   he has made rosetta all blue.. :P
   04:17 Seveas       haha
   04:17 OgMaciel     ubuntuser_ba has actually won a sweepstake I sponsored
                      for translators... he's scored the highest karma
   === raphink is Raphal Pinson btw too ;)
   04:18 ubuntuser_ba blue translations is necessary
   04:18 mako         killer :)
   04:18 OgMaciel     he won an upcoming Ubuntu book whicj I'll be mailing to
                      him soon
   04:18 mako         very excellent
   04:18 raphink      oo nice :)
   04:18 mako         ubuntuser_ba: how long have you been involved?
   === Kamion looks at Planeta Ubuntu Brasil and is impressed that it seems
   to be more active than the English Planet
   04:18 OgMaciel     yup... he seems to have no life... hehehe
   04:18 ubuntuser_ba with translations or Ubuntu?
   04:19 OgMaciel     Kamion we've been busy spreading the word... ;)
   04:19 MarioMeyer   Kamion, we've been working a lot on that
   04:19 OgMaciel     our wiki has been getting bigger too, thanks to people
                      like ubuntuser_ba and lucasd
   04:20 Kamion       well, I'm happy with ubuntuser_ba for membership;
                      you're clearly working hard and it's a strong community

                      With some friends, I've carry out a reorganization of
                      Ubuntu Italian Community. I'm very interested in
   04:22 twilight     programming, expecially with python. In python, I've
                      written a simple program to move Italian Page from
                      wiki.ubuntu.com to our (Italian) wiki.ubuntu-it.org.
                      07:53 <mdke> LorenzoSfarra (twilight) - he's the 4th
                      member of the Italian locoteam group, and the only one
                      not a member yet. he contributes heavily to translation
   04:23 Kamion       work, on the italian wiki, he edits the main italian
                      website and is a forum moderator. He has given a lot of
                      time to the project for many months now, and is a
                      really vital part of our team.

   04:28 mako         lucasd: go ahead
                      My name is Lucas. I live in Maranho/Brazil. I've ever
                      been a big fan of free software and I wanted to
   04:29 lucasd       actually live it. So I started using Linux. Before
                      Ubuntu, I have already used Slackware, Red Hat and
                      Debian, and then, 6 months ago, I met Ubuntu.
                      As an engaged community person, I did a lot of things I
                      could to Ubuntu. For instance, I've been a constant
   04:29 lucasd       helper at IRC and at Mailing lists, and tried to help
                      with tasks related to our community. Also, I've
                      translated a lot of packages to my native language at
                      Rosetta.
                      In the future, I wanna dedicate more of my time to
                      Ubuntu, start to work with things I haven't helped at
   04:29 lucasd       all. As an Ubuntu official member, I'll have more
                      support  to organize and participate of events about
                      Ubuntu, help with Brazil' regional sub-teams. And, of
                      course, spread Ubuntu everywhere I can.
   04:29 Seveas       twilight, please hang around, kamion still has to vote
                      and will do that soon
   04:29 ogra_ibook   Seveas, he did
   04:30 ogra_ibook   Seveas, "Kamion same as above really, I'm happy,
                      especially with mdke's testimonial"
   === mako nods to ogra_ibook
   04:30 Seveas       ah ok
   04:30 Seveas       in that case: welcome aboard twilight !

   04:31 Seveas       lucasd, what is STOPy?
                      Seveas, it's a game where a word is choosen and
   04:31 lucasd       everybody who is playing has to give words starting
                      with that word
   04:31 Seveas       one of you, change your nickname :p
   04:31 lucas        (but I expected to be highlighted quite a lot today ;p)
   === Hirion [n=hirion@draugr.de] has joined #ubuntu-meeting
   04:32 lucasd       so.. the STOPy is a game written in Python using GTK
                      that simulates this game
   04:32 twilight     ubuntuser_ba, grazie mille! and congratulations for
                      your italian :)
   04:32 lucasd       and, it uses the IRC to the communication
   04:32 ogra_ibook   hmm, sounds intresting for edubuntu :)
   === Seveas was thinking the same
   04:32 MarioMeyer   ogra_ibook, brazillians actually play that a lot in
                      schools
   04:33 ogra_ibook   cool !
   04:33 MarioMeyer   instead of watching the classes.. lol
   04:33 Seveas       hehe
   04:33 OgMaciel     hehe
   04:33 ubuntuser_ba in out of school too.. ;)
   === Hirion [n=hirion@draugr.de] has left #ubuntu-meeting []
   === OgMaciel apologizes for being abset... boss walked in my cubicle
   04:33 Seveas       lucasd, you should either avoid ogra the coming weeks
                      or get that game into Ubuntu ;)
   04:33 ogra_ibook   lol
   04:33 OgMaciel     lucasd has, as they say in the street, some "mad
                      programming skillz"  ;)
   04:34 MarioMeyer   he tought me everything i know about PyGTK
   04:34 lucasd       Seveas, we have a plan to include this in Ubuntu, but
                      the project not quite mature yet
   04:34 MarioMeyer   lol
   04:34 lucasd       hehe
   04:34 Seveas       lucasd, then now you have one more reason to complete
                      it
   04:34 ubuntuser_ba hehehehe
   04:34 ogra_ibook   yeah
   04:34 lucasd       for sure..
   04:34 MarioMeyer   :P
   04:34 mako         the translations work looks very good
   04:35 Seveas       yup
   04:35 mako         as does the other loco team work
   04:35 ubuntuser_ba Ubuntu here in Brazil is very serious uf us.. ;)
   04:35 Seveas       and the Brazil team is rocking quite hard
   04:35 ubuntuser_ba to us..
   04:35 MarioMeyer   i think, together with ubuntuser_ba, lucasd  is the
                      "real active translation team"
   04:35 OgMaciel     Seveas right on!
   04:35 OgMaciel     MarioMeyer agreed!

                      since May/05, and contributing to the Ubuntu project
                      nearly as long, mostly on the wiki and DocTeam projects
   04:38 Madpilot     - I can't program, but I *can* proofread, edit and
                      document. I've helped rewrite a couple of sections of
                      the Desktop Guide, including the whole CD burning
                      section. I'm also involved in the Canadian LoCo Team &
                      Marketing.
                      I try to provide intelligent feedback from a
   04:38 Madpilot     new-to-Linux-but-learning-fast perspective, and in
                      between that there's always typos on the wiki to hunt
                      down and kill!
   04:38 dholbach     Madpilot: so you're responsible for those 24679246 wiki
                      mails i get from you per week? :)
   04:38 Seveas       Madpilot is also quite active on IRC
   04:38 Seveas       active and helpful even :)
   04:39 jsgotangco   no that's the other Burger heh
   04:39 Madpilot     hmm, yeah, I left the IRC stuff out of the three liner,
                      didn't I?
   === OgMaciel has to go now... congrats to all new members and good luck to

   04:39 mako         OgMaciel: thanks for showing up
   04:39 ubuntuser_ba Thansk OgMaciel
   04:39 OgMaciel     mako always a pleasurew
   04:39 ubuntuser_ba *thanks
   04:39 Seveas       Madpilot, how active are you on the forums?
   04:39 Madpilot     dholbach: that's probably my younger brother,
                      Corey/Burgundavia - he's noisier that me...
   04:39 lucasd       OgMaciel, thanks very much :)
   04:39 raphink      bye OgMaciel
   04:39 OgMaciel     later guys...
   04:39 Madpilot     Seveas: middling active, mostly on the Gnome Desktop &
                      Absolute Beginners sections
   04:40 dholbach     Madpilot: you're quite active too :)
   04:40 mako         is there anyone from the docteam with a testimonial?
   04:40 jsgotangco   +1 he's been very active in doc/wiki
                      we need more forum - CC meeting interaction, it would
   04:40 Seveas       help if you join the CC meetings more often when there
                      are forum issues so you can feed them back there
   04:40 mhz          As a Moin fan, I can tell Madpilot has been doing a
                      really awsome work on wiki keeping
                      the wiki being what it is, it's hard to tell exactly
   04:40 Kamion       which parts of that are your writing style, but I like
                      it anyway
   04:40 jsgotangco   he may not be the greatest docbook author out there,
                      but he does help everyday
   04:40 Kamion       (-> Madpilot)
   04:40 Seveas       jsgotangco, nice
   === ogra_ibook absolutely trusts dholbachs wiki judgement ... since
   dholbach is subscribed to all of it ...
   04:41 jsgotangco   another Burger won't hurt
   04:41 jsgotangco   :D
   04:41 Madpilot     jsgotangco: :P
   04:41 raphink      lol
   04:41 jsgotangco   dholbach, make that x2 of the mails we receive then
   04:41 ogra_ibook   heh
   04:42 dholbach     :)
   04:42 mako         jsgotangco: nepotism has no place in our project
   04:42 jsgotangco   lol
   04:43 Seveas       hmm
   === mhz would like to have a mad pilot and a burger as a fella memeber
   04:43 Kamion       well, the things I've been browsing through on the wiki
                      for five minutes look pretty good
   04:44 mako         ditto
                      and I'm definitely keen to encourage people who are
   04:44 Kamion       relatively new to free software and are writing
                      documentation
   04:44 mhz          I think Madpilot has been very efficient
   04:44 jsgotangco   oh he's been here for a very long time
   04:44 mako         i also appreciate the irc support work althought that's
                      harder for me to gugage
   04:44 jsgotangco   he's been very very visible as well
                      since the programmers here will know that it's very
   04:44 Kamion       very hard to try to think yourself back to the point
                      where you *didn't* understand things when writing
                      documentation
   04:44 Seveas       mako, he's one of the good guys in #ubuntu

   04:45 mako         is manu around?
   04:46 Kamion       Seveas: I certainly wouldn't object if he's willing
   === mako nods
   04:46 elmo         is the stuff on http://www.manucornet.net/ubuntu/

   04:47 dholbach     lllmanulll can't be here - did the meeting time change?
   04:47 Seveas       no
   04:47 Madpilot     Kamion: done
   04:47 mako         i feel like i've approved azeem as a member like 3

   04:47 Seveas       there was an error at the wiki though
   04:48 raphink      dholbach: yes a few weeks ago
   04:48 mako         :)
   04:48 Kamion       I thought we'd approved azeem before, but maybe it was
                      only 2/4

                      been happy to give a testimonial.
   04:48 azeem        I never got to even paste my 3-liner
   04:48 mako         azeem: we can make it official then
   04:48 Seveas       azeem, ah right, you were ok with postponing
   04:48 mako         azeem: well hurry up :)
   04:48 Seveas       azeem, well, give us the 3-lineer now then :)
   04:48 Kamion       oh, you were at a christmas party last time
                      I am Michael Banck, a 28 year old chemistry PhD student
   04:48 azeem        from Munich, Germany.  My wiki page is at

                      I have been using GNU/Linux for almost ten years and
                      Ubuntu for about one year now (and maintain my parent's
   04:49 azeem        desktop since October 2004).  I am a Debian Developer
                      as well. I do various things for Debian but plan to do
                      mainly scientific/chemistry related work for Ubuntu as
                      part of MOTUScience.
                      I have done so for some chemistry packages for a while
                      now, by merging back Ubuntu changes to Debian and
   04:49 azeem        making sure the Debian packages build fine on Ubuntu as
                      well. I also cared for multisync in Ubuntu in the past
                      and recently joined lifeless and ajmitch for a more
                      ambitious opensync/multisync effort for Ubuntu/Debian.

   04:51 sivang       who's Josh Hartnett ?
                      yeah, I'm happy with azeem obviously, he's been

                      he's wanting to contribute to MOTU now

                      I've been involved in Ubuntu as a MOTU Helpful for more
                      than 2 months, uploading packages to REVU, merging
                      packages and reviewing packages on REVU. I've got 8
   04:52 raphink      packages in Dapper through REVU. I also work on

   04:53 Seveas       since the previous meeting, I've seen raphink being

   04:53 dholbach     raphink ROCKs!
   04:53 ogra_ibook   i'm astonished it took you this long to apply for

   04:53 raphink      lol
   04:53 sistpoty     from raphink's work on motu-side, it's quite a shame he

   04:53 raphink      sistpoty: couldn't apply before, hadn't been involved
                      long enough ;)
   04:54 mako         Kamion: hm...
                      raphink has done some great KDE MOTU work including
   04:54 Riddell      reviewing others packages (much needed) so I fully
                      support his membership
   04:54 sistpoty     raphink: that was meant as praise ;)
   04:54 raphink      ;)
   04:55 Seveas       raphink, please review my package, i need one more
                      advocate :)
   04:55 raphink      Seveas: can't advocate yet I'm afraid ;)
   04:55 Riddell      Seveas: he can't advocate yet, not a MOTU
                      raphink didn't need to be told what to do, he just was
   04:55 dholbach     there and started working in the team. I'm completely
                      happy with him as a member (and MOTU soon) too.
   04:56 Seveas       raphink, Riddell that'll change pretty soon I guess ;)
                      certainly more Kubuntu-based MOTU work seems like a
   04:56 Kamion       good thing; I haven't followed up all the links to
                      packages but if Riddell's happy with him on that front
                      then that's good enough for me
   04:56 raphink      :)

   04:59 bshumate     hi
   05:00 Kamion       I have a testimonial for Brian from mdke, if he's here
                      Greetings everyone! My name is Brian Shumate; I'm a 32
                      year-old IT guy, with about two decades of computing
   05:00 bshumate     experience, and half of that in a professional capacity
                      as a IT Consultant, System Administrator, and
                      Technologist.
                      I am also an Artist, a father of 2 wonderful children,
                      and the husband of a charming wife.  I've used
   05:00 bshumate     GNU/Linux now for about twelve years now, and Ubuntu is
                      what prompted me to show my appreciation by giving back
                      to the FLOSS world! :-)
                      In the last two months+ I have been active almost
                      exclusively in the Documentation Team, having
                      contributed eight patches, and authored five Wiki
   05:00 bshumate     pages.  I've provided some help in the #ubuntu IRC
                      channel for the past two months as well. I am also in
                      the final stages of preparing an Art Project which I
                      sincerely hope will garner Ubuntu plenty of positive
                      free press in the coming months!

                      In the future, I plan to author more Wiki pages, and
                      guides for those new to Ubuntu, and assist the
   05:00 bshumate     Documentation Team in any capacity required. I hope to
                      also conclude the writing of an Ubuntu-related book
                      that I have in progress at present. ;-)
                      07:54 <mdke> BrianShumate (bshumate) - has been
                      contributing regularly to the documentation team for
                      the last couple of months and in that time has produced
   05:01 Kamion       more documentation than anyone else. He has contributed
                      several passages to the serverguide for dapper, and
                      several extremely high class wiki pages, mainly about
                      security. He is a incredibly valuable member of the doc
                      team.
   05:01 Seveas       security documentation++
   05:01 mako         nice
   05:01 jsgotangco   OpenSSL wiki page
   === Seveas feeds ubotu these pages
   05:02 Madpilot     bshumate's wiki pages are excellent - the Bastille
                      Linux one & Strong Passwords ones especially.
   05:02 Seveas       i'm browsing through a few of them, they are great
   05:02 mako         excellent work
   === Kamion goes off to read the openssh ones
   05:02 mako         and mdke's recommendation is a strong point as well
   05:03 Seveas       AllowUsers jhendrix svaughan
   05:03 Seveas       DenyUsers wgates sballmer
   05:03 Seveas       LOL!
   === bshumate enjoys helping a truly noble cause
   05:04 bshumate     Seveas: ;-)
                      bshumate: in the modern world you probably want
   05:04 Kamion       PubkeyAuthentication rather than RSAAuthentication -
                      the latter's protocol 1 only
   05:04 Kamion       (reading the server guide)
   05:05 bshumate     Kamion: good point there! I'll adjust it.
   05:05 sivang       Seveas: ubotu ?
   05:05 Seveas       sivang, the resident cluebot in #ubuntu
   05:05 sivang       Seveas: ah nice
                      I disagree with you about PermitRootLogin, but that's a
   05:05 Kamion       long-standing argument we certainly aren't going to
                      resolve here. :)
   05:06 bshumate     Kamion: i personally use "without-password" ;-)
   05:06 Kamion       also X11Forwarding is not a risk to the server, it's a
                      risk to the client
   05:06 ogra_ibook   and disabling it would break ltsp :)
   05:07 Kamion       ogra_ibook: nobody's talking about the defaults
   05:07 ogra_ibook   i know
   05:07 Kamion       anyway, while I have some quibbles with the details, on
                      the whole it's very clear and good documentation
   05:08 sivang       Kamion: how so?
   05:08 Kamion       so yeah, I'm fine with bshumate for membership based on
                      what I'm seeing. More of the same would rock. :-)
   05:08 Kamion       sivang: aboe
   05:08 Kamion       above
   === mako nods
   05:08 sivang       eh
   05:08 mako         same from me
   05:08 mako         the docs i've looked through look great
   05:08 Kamion       bshumate: oh, also, disabling password prompts can also
                      involve disabling keyboard-interactive auth
   === Seveas nods along
   05:08 Seveas       great documentation
   05:08 mhz          Madpilot: so, I never got the part were you were
                      accepted but ogra told me you were, so Congrats!!!
   05:08 Kamion       (ChallengeResponseAuthentication no)
   05:09 Madpilot     mhz: thanks!
   05:09 bshumate     Kamion: noted. I'll spruce it up accordingly. ;-)
                      bshumate: yeah, without-password is pretty reasonable
   05:09 Kamion       and useful since you can configure sshd to give you an
                      audit trail of the public key used to log in as root
   05:10 Kamion       which can be useful on boxes with multiple admins
   05:10 mako         elmo: ?
   05:10 Kamion       (though you can do similar things with sudo of course)
   05:10 elmo         ack
   05:10 mako         that's it for my list
   05:10 Seveas       ok, cool
   05:10 Seveas       welcome aboard bshumate!
   05:10 mako         anyone else here have other business for the council?
   05:10 jsgotangco   weeee
   05:10 lucasd       bshumate, congratulations! :)
   05:11 Seveas       (and please keep on writing such good documentation)
   05:11 bshumate     Thanks everyone!
   05:11 mako         speak now or hold your peace for 2 weeks
   05:11 ogra_ibook   congrats bshumate

   05:11 mako         Kamion: ok
   05:11 Madpilot     yeah, congrats to all, and thanks!
   05:11 mhz          bshumate: google!!!
   05:11 Seveas       ahm Kamion has to spoil it :p
   05:12 Kamion       we have some, er, notable people on the lp proposed
                      members list
   05:12 bshumate     mhz: hmm?
   05:12 mako         Kamion: ahh.. good point
                      just 1 thing.. a brazillian member wants to buy
   05:12 MarioMeyer   kubuntu-br.org and start using it.. does the CC have
                      anything agains it?
   05:12 Kamion       Jane Weideman, Jeff Waugh
   05:12 mako         ah,
   05:12 Kamion       anyone object to me just setting those to approved?
   05:12 mhz          bshumate: congrats! it's just that i told raphink
                      'yahoo' :D
   05:12 elmo         no
   05:12 dholbach     Kamion: we should interrogate both of them. :-)
   05:13 mako         jeff and jane sound fine
   05:13 Seveas       dholbach, agreed
   05:13 Kamion       I think it's pretty obvious they've been making
                      sustained and significant contributions :-)
   05:13 ogra_ibook   heh
   05:13 Seveas       Kamion, someone should prune that list too
   === cyphase [n=cyphase@adsl-68-125-50-225.dsl.pltn13.pacbell.net] has
   joined #ubuntu-meeting
   05:13 Riddell      MarioMeyer: ideally they'd get canonical to buy it
   05:13 mako         i think we can bend the rules for those two :)
   05:13 Seveas       I've been poking them a few months ago
   05:13 bshumate     mhz: ahh. thanks! :-)
   === mhz must leave now
