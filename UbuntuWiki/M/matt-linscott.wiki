=== About Me ===

I'm a Software Engineer for LexisNexis Applied Discovery. I'm passionate about software development, and am willing to learn anything about it. I started using Ubuntu on its Hardy Heron release, but having grown more comfortable over the years with it, I now use it as a secondary development workstation.

=== Future Goals ===

Have been using Ubuntu for a few years now, and mainly being a consumer, I now want to be a contributor to the community. Also, I'm hoping to grow as a C/C++ software developer.
