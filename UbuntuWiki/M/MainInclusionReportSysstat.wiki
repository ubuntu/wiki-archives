=== Requirements ===

# ''Availability:'' <nowiki>[[http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/s/sysstat]]</nowiki>; available for all supported architectures.
# ''Rationale:''
** https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ServerPackageReview
 0. ''Security:''
** <nowiki>[[http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=sysstat|CVE entries]]</nowiki>: 4 entries. none of them seem to affect the version in hardy.
** <nowiki>[[http://secunia.com/search/?search=sysstat|Secunia history]]</nowiki>: same story as CVE db.
** Any binaries running as root or suid/sgid ?  Any daemons ?
    Yes one daemon running as root to collect data.
** Network activity: does it open any port ?  Does it handle incoming network data ?
    no open ports. daemon run locally.
** High level source code review performed by JamieStrandboge
** sa1
*** /bin/sh script 
*** called via /etc/cron.d/sysstat and /etc/init.d/sysstat
*** wrapper for sadc and does file manipulation in /var/log/sysstat properly
** sa2
*** /bin/sh
*** called via /etc/cron.daily/sysstat
*** wrapper for sar.sysstat and does file manipulation properly (oddly, it does a cd to /usr/bin, then does 'rm' and 'find ... -exec' ..., but the paths to 'rm' and 'find' are absolute paths in /var/log/sysstat) 
** sadc
*** ELF binary
*** called via sa1 and sar.sysstat (and therefore sa2)
*** vulnerable to TOCTOU via access() in open_ofile(). High-level review shows this should not be an issue in practice, as checked files when run from cron and initscript are all in /var/log/sysstat, which is owned by root.  Should only be a problem if run by root and output file is somewhere writable be normal users (eg /tmp)
*** spot-checked memory and string functions and it performs them properly
*** reads the following files (which can't be manipulated by users):
### /proc/stat
### /proc/loadavg
### /proc/meminfo
### /proc/vmstat
### /proc/tty/driver/serial (requires root)
### /proc/interrupts
### /proc/sys/fs/dentry-state
### /proc/sys/fs/file-nr
### /proc/sys/fs/inode-state
### /proc/net/dev
### /proc/net/sockstat
### /proc/net/rpc/nfs
### /proc/net/rpc/nfsd
### /proc/diskstats
### /proc/partitions
### /proc/uptime
*** it would be nice if sadc could be run as non-root, as it needs it for only one file (/proc/tty/driver/serial)
** sar.sysstat
*** ELF binary
*** called via sa2
*** spot-checked memory and string functions and it performs them properly
*** found slight problem with call to execvp function, but will report upstream and upload

 0. ''Quality assurance:''
** In what situations does the package not work out of the box without configuration ?
    none
** Does the package ask any debconf questions higher than priority 'medium' ?
    Yes, only when upgrading from < 8.0.0
** <nowiki>[[http://bugs.debian.org/src:sysstat|Debian bugs]]</nowiki>: nothing scary.
** <nowiki>[[http://packages.qa.debian.org/s/sysstat.html|Maintenance in Debian]]</nowiki> is vigorous
** <nowiki>[[http://pagesperso-orange.fr/sebastien.godard/]]</nowiki> is vigorous
** Hardware: Does this package deal with hardware and if so how exotic is it ?
    no
 0. ''Standards compliance:'' 
** <nowiki>[[http://www.pathname.com/fhs/|FHS]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[http://www.de.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/|Debian Policy]]</nowiki>
    Yeps.
** <nowiki>[[http://www.netfort.gr.jp/~dancer/column/libpkg-guide/libpkg-guide.html|Debian library packaging guide]]</nowiki> standards compliance ?
    no libs
** Packaging system (debhelper/cdbs/dbs) ?  Patch system ?  Any packaging oddities ?
    none.
 0. ''Dependencies:''
** B-D are all in main.
** Depends for isag binary are not but it could easily stay in universe. The stuff for the core is all in main.
