__TOC__

Michael lives in Boston, MA, in the United States, and has been an Ubuntu user since summer 2005, when he switched cold turkey on all three of his computers from Windows (98, ME, and XP) to Hoary.  He's never looked back and his only regret is not switching sooner.

His website is at http://ftmichael.tashari.org/ and he has a profile on a million social networking sites, where his username is nearly always ftmichael.  He is ftmichael on http://ubuntuforums.org/ as well.
