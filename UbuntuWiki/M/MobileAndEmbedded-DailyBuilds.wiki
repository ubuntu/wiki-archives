=== Mobile and Embedded Daily Builds ===

Daily builds can be found at http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/moblin/, with the logs at http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-archive/moblin-build-logs/hardy/. We currently produce builds for the two supported platforms, McCaslin and Menlow. For those two platforms, we build two targets, a core target, and a full target. Provided under the platform name directory is a project tarball suitable for importing the build into moblin-image-creator.
