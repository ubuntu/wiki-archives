1. ''Availibity:'' http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/o/open-iscsi/

2. ''Rationale:'' This is the User-Space utilities package required for iSCSI initiator implementation in Ubuntu. As iSCSI is becoming more and more popular people want to use it with Ubuntu as an initiator (client). This package is the easiest way to handle iSCSI initiation in Ubuntu.

3. ''Security:'' <nowiki>[[http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-3100|CVE-2007-3100]]</nowiki> <nowiki>[[http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-3099|CVE-2007-3099]]</nowiki>
                 The package installs the user space of the iscsi initiator, which includes the iscsi daemon and the iscsiadm. The iscsid is run as root since it is managed as an init script. Though it doesnt open any ports, it does allow gargantuan amounts of data to be received.  So far no code review have been performed that the submitter knows of.  

4. ''QA'': open-iscsi discovery and initiation process is pretty easy.
