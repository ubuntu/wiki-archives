=== Use Cases ===

Jim runs a medium sized business and he wishes to control all of his computers from a single point. He sets up a single configuration computer and then 

Mary is part of a rapidly growing company that is adding new employees all the time. She wants to be able to turn a computer on and have it netboot into a complete system.
