== Introduction ==

My Name is Martin Liesenberg, I am a computer science student from Berlin, Germany. I have been using Linux for a couple of years, mainly Ubuntu and other debian-based systems.

I started programming in late 2004, learning C++ at first. Through school, universtiy and practice I learnt to use the following languages: 

* Java
* Javascript
* PHP
* C++
* MySQL
* Haskell

Apart from open source and computer science / software development my interest lie primarily in the areas of intercultural competencies/communication, travelling and personal development.
