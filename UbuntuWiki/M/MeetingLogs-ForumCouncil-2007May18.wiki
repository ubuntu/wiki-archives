=== April 13th 2007 Forum Council Meeting ===

The Forum Council had a very productive meeting today!

Here is what was covered:

1.  The Hardware Team will be merged with the Beginners Team.  Bodhi_Zazen and Lord Illidan will be Co-Leaders.

2.  Guidlines for "sticky" threads were established.

3.  Ubuntu-Geek discussed some of the recent changes in the forum layout and features.
* Launchpad Profile links have been added as an option to Forum Members profile
* When posting a new thread or a reply in the support areas of the forums users can link to a Launchpad bug. (several people were wondering when the launchpad team would reciprocate)

4.  The FC approved an application process for 3rd party projects to request a forum. link

5.  The FC agreed on an official stance on 3rd party installation scripts.  link

Next Meeting to be held on May 18th @ 20:00 UTC on irc.freenode.net channel #ubuntu-meeting.
