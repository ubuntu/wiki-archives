== Testing has now completed, thank you for submitting your results! ==

== Mir Multimonitor Testing ==

Multimonitor testing will be conducted via a Call for Testing from 8/26/13 - 8/28/13 for Ubuntu 13.10. During this timeframe the feature will be provided via the Ubuntu 13.10 system-compositor-testing PPA and will be integrated into trunk/archive shortly after testing ends.

Please be sure to read the setup & notes to be aware of known issues and expectations.

The listed test cases can also be used for general regression testing for multimonitor functionality.

We would like to know your success and failures with this feature. We are tracking results in the <nowiki>[[ http:--packages.qa.ubuntu.com-qatracker-milestones-298-builds-51476-testcases-1572-results | QA Tracker ]]</nowiki> but also in the <nowiki>[[ -results | MultiMonitor test results ]]</nowiki> wiki. Feel free to add your findings to the place that is more convenient to you.

/!\ '''Please be aware that there is a security sensitive bug in this Mir release (https://bugs.launchpad.net/xmir/+bug/1192843)'''.

=== Setup ===

Install the PPA that enables multi-monitor. This can be done by the following.
   $> sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mir-team/system-compositor-testing
Then update your package list
   $> sudo apt-get update
We have to make sure updates in main don’t overwrite packages from the Mir PPA.
Please edit /etc/apt/preferences.d/50-pin-mir.pref with following content:

`Package: *`<<BR>>
`Pin: origin "private-ppa.launchpad.net"`<<BR>>
`Pin-Priority: 1001`<<BR>>

`Package: *`<<BR>>
`Pin: release o=LP-PPA-mir-team-system-compositor-testing`<<BR>>
`Pin-Priority: 1002`<<BR>>

Last but not least, install all the relevant packages
   $> sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
And either reboot or restart lightdm (via sudo service lightdm restart)

Please ensure you are running Xmir by running
   $> top
wait a moment watching the process list, if you see unity-system-compositor listed...you are running Xmir.

In the event you are not running Xmir, you may need to install unity-system-compositor
   $> sudo apt-get install unity-system-compositor
Reboot or restart lightdm (via sudo service lightdm restart). Re-verfiy you are running Xmir.

In the event this PPA causes major problems for you or you simply wish to return to the standard archive. Purge the packages with the following steps

   $> sudo apt-get install ppa-purge
   $> sudo ppa-purge ppa:mir-team/system-compositor-testing
Then unpin the PPA
   $> sudo rm /etc/apt/preferences.d/50-pin-mir.pref 
   $> sudo apt-get update
   $> sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
And either reboot or restart lightdm (via sudo service lightdm restart)

=== General Multimonitor Testing Notes ===
==== Bugs and expectations ====
First you can find a list of all the bugs we've identified so far relevant to multimonitor here https://bugs.launchpad.net/xmir/+bugs?field.tag=multimonitor tagged with "multimonitor".
High level summary of what to expect with Xmir multimonitor, we have bugs for these issues so no need to duplicate.
** Supported HW
*** Intel working
*** Radeon not working (is working with Xmir)
*** Nouveau is not working (is working with Xmir)
** Hotplug works for VGA, HDMI, DisplayPort
** Mirror mode works
** Extended desktop works
** Resoltion changes not working
** Rotating screens not working
** Changing relative positions of built-in vs 2nd display is working
** In multimonitor mode, one monitor can have frame lag (sometimes, but frequent), user feels typing delay
** Sometimes turning of 2nd display through settings can hang X
** DisplayPort will show on 2nd display activity even though turned off
** XMir receives input from other VTs (https://bugs.launchpad.net/xmir/+bug/1192843). This has security implications

==== Double Check Setup ====
Second, if you experience issue it would be good to ensure the packages loaded match those listed in 
https://launchpad.net/~mir-team/+archive/system-compositor-testing/+packages
you may do this by inspecting your packages installed indicated by 
   $> apt-cache policy <package name>
of which the most important are xserver-org-video-intel (or ati, nouveau), xserver-xorg-xmir & unity-system-compositor

==== Be Patient ====
Third, in some cases be patient both to ensure you are not witnessing a bug or to help elicit a bug by providing enough time between connect & disconnect of cables. X takes some moments to accommodate the display configuration change. Also it may be worthy to remind you that this is pre-beta software which has not been optimized. The goal is to discover functional issues.

==== Checking on Mir vs X Issues ====
Fourth, in the event you experience an issue such as a blackscreen or ui lockup, another good debug step is to run a mir_demo_client_xxx. Simply VT switch (e.g. ctl+alt+F1) login and type
   $> sudo chmod 777 /tmp/mir_socket
   $> sudo mir_demo_client_egltriangle
switch back to mir server on VT (ctl+alt+F7), if mir is still operating you will see spinning triangle, this means X has had an issue. This is good to note if you author a bug.

==== What to Collect ====
Fifth, based on our preliminary testing, it is most useful to capture the /var/log/Xorg.0.log or Xorg.0.log.old in the instance of a catastrophic bug. Since you may be rebooting, its good to check the timestamps to be certain you are sharing the right log.

Also, photos and videos of your experiences are welcome to be attached to any bug reports.

And of course collect your graphics card information
   $> lspci | grep "VGA"
and simply report that line to the bug.

If you experience a crash, you may also check the /var/crash/ folder for new *.crash files. Check their dates. If relevant you may attach those to the bugs as well.

==== Reporting your results ====
Remember to report your results good or bad on the provided wiki results page or by using the packages tracker. We are tracking results in the <nowiki>[[ http:--packages.qa.ubuntu.com-qatracker-milestones-298-builds-51476-testcases-1572-results | QA Tracker ]]</nowiki> but also in the <nowiki>[[ -results | MultiMonitor test results ]]</nowiki> wiki. Feel free to add your findings to the place that is more convenient to you.

==== If You Get Stuck ====
Lastly, in the event you experience any issue or problem, just ping on IRC freenode #ubuntu-mir

==== Test 4.1 ====
* boot to multimonitor (or if booted to single screen, connect 2nd monitor)
* open System Settings... -> Displays, note the current resolution (referred to as res1)
* change resolution down for “built in display”, note it, refer to as res2

* Ensure preconditions
* System Settings... -> Displays is in its default configuration

==== Test 6.1 ====
* boot to multimonitor (or if booted to single screen, connect 2nd monitor)
* open System Settings... -> Displays to see the reflected virtual relationship of the “built-in display” to the second display
* verify with the mouse by exiting the relative side of “built-in display” the mouse appears/enters the second display as reflected in the  Displays dialog box

==== Test 6.2 ====
* assumes expected Test 6.1 post condition
* in System Settings... -> Displays, select & grab the secondary display to move its relative position to the “built-in” display (effectively swap their position left-right of each other)
* verify with the mouse by exiting the relative side of “built-in display” the mouse appears/enters the second display as reflected in the  Displays dialog box
