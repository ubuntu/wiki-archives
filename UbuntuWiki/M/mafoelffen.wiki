=== About Me... ===

I have been known by this screen name since early BBS days and have kept it through many years.  I started using Unix back in 1988 in the Army and have been playing with and supporting Operating Systems ever since.  I started helping people (professionally) with their computers back in 1987. I started using Ubuntu in 2007 when I changed from beta testing and supporting Unix systems to supporting Linux systems. I started using the Ubuntu Forums in March 2010.

=== Contributions to Ubuntu... ===

My contributions to the Ubuntu Community have been primarily with work on the Ubuntu Forums where I have provided technical support and published various tutorials.

I primarily provided community support in the Ubuntu Forums Installation & Upgrades Section.  I provide support for resolving graphics problems through maintaining and helping people via the sticky linked below.  I have been active in the testing of new releases since Ubuntu 9.04 alpha1. I am also active at Launchpad, especially where it concerns graphics issues with Ubuntu. It is still relevant today as a reference and diagnostics tool..

* [[http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1743535 |[Sticky] Graphics Resolution- Upgrade /Blank Screen after reboot]]: A guide to diagnosing and correcting graphics problems under Ubuntu Natty Narwhal 11.04.  That is how it started, but evolved in resolving graphics issues for Linux and Unix.

My other main input on the Ubuntu Forums has been with technical and general assistance on Ubuntu problems. I am active primarily in areas of the Forums that deals with graphics issues, Grub, multi-boot and server issues but I can also be found in general support areas. I also enjoy testing the development server and desktop editions of Ubuntu.

I have been a member of the Ubuntu Server Team since 2012 and have been an Ubuntu Forums Moderator. My main support since then expanded to the Ubuntu Forums Server and Virtualization Sections.

I was voted in as an Ubuntu Member by the Ubuntu Forums Administrative Council in 2012.

I am the author of the UbuntuForums 'system-info' script, which I gave to the Ubuntu Forums to help their Members to be able support Users. I am the Administrator for the <nowiki>[[https://github.com/UbuntuForums/system-info|UbuntuForums 'system-info']]</nowiki> GitHub Repository (TEST & STABLE) for that.

I am active with Ubuntu Development cycle testing, LaunchPad bug submissions and coming up with work-around's for various issues.

I have Unix, Linux and Windows experience as a System Administrator, Database Administrator, Software Developer and Network Administrator. I understand how the pieces of a diverse environment should work together, and how to make that appear seamless to it's users.

==== Volunteer Work... ====

I have promoted Ubuntu in my local community's Linux User Group (OLYLUG).  I also help local users and Non-Profit Computer Recyclers in their use of Linux as a medium to distribute computers to new users and groups.

I am a contributor to the 'boot-repair' and 'boot-info' scripts.

=== Plans... ===

I enjoy working on the Ubuntu Forums.  I love to make things work and helping others.  I am always open to further what I know and to share what I have learned with others.  I was interested in the idea of Ubuntu Membership based on Forums work.

Some of the Ubuntu Forums Staff has asked me to write some Ubuntu Guides for diagnosing and resolving X graphics issues and on diagnosing bootup issues. I have been working with XWindows and XServer since 1988.

Ubuntu is a medium that is open, user friendly and easy to learn for people.  It has helped me make computers accessible to people and to make people's older hardware "usable" again in a manner than it performs better than when it was new. It is also well suited for high end, current hardware and technologies.

I openly support Linux as an Operating System (not just Debian Branches, but also RHEL, and SUSE branches). I also support Cloud and Container services.
