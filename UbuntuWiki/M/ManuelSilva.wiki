== About Ubuntu Usage ==

I chose Ubuntu as my default GNU/Linux distro on my laptops because it works pretty well, configuring automatically almost all hardware on-the-fly. 

I still maintain a 5.04 version of Ubuntu where I got several problems configuring an Epson EPL-5900L that worked twice and stopped to work after restart. Besides that, I like the way Ubuntu and XUbuntu come pre-configured.
