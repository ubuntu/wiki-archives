==== Dates ====

The conference will be held between '''5-18 December 2004'''.

If you intend to come for the full conference, plan to arrive into Barcelona on
December 5 and out again on December 18th. It is alright to come for only part
of the conference and many people are doing so.

==== How to Attend ====

All Canonical employees will be in attendance and anyone else who is interested or involved in Ubuntu is welcome to attend as well.

While the conference is open, we do need to have an idea of who is going to be coming. Please fill in your information at ConferenceAttendees if you plan on attending. If you are no longer attending, please update the page.

==== Goals and Agenda ====

There is an initial sketch of ConferenceGoals online.
The draft conference agenda can be found here : ConfAgenda - it's WIP, and more BOFs will be added this week.

We may have a few more organized talks although the current plan is to
focus on less formal "Birds of a Feather" (BOF) meetings. We want to try to
organize these so that each BOF leaves with something. It might be a plan, a
piece of code, etc. In each case, each BOF should terminate with a written
report of the BOF, the conclusions, and the action items (and who they were
assigned).

Feel free to suggest BOFs here: ConferenceBOFs

==== Conference Venue ====

'''UPDATE'''

The conference will be in Mataró, which is just outside of Barcelona. We will
be holding the working sessions at the `Hotel NH Ciutat de Mataró`
There should be sufficient bandwidth available, although we still may have to set up our own wireless network for convenience.

* Address: Hotel NH Ciutat de Mataró, Camí Ral, 648 - Esq. San Valentin, 08302 Mataro - Barcelona, Spain
* Hotel phone number: +34 93 7575522
* Location map - please see: ConferenceMaps

   
==== Languages ====

The first language of Catalonia is Catalan, not Spanish (also known as Castillian). Almost everybody who speaks Catalan also speaks Spanish, but many menus, road signs, etc. are in Catalan. Speakers of any romance language will probably be able to read Catalan at a basic level. If you speak no Spanish or Catalan you will have few if any problems, as many people also speak English (and French), and are incredibly helpful. 

==== Accommodations ====

The Canonical Employees will be staying at the Hotel called called Hotel NH Ciutat de Mataró. 

Address: Camí Ral, 648 - Esq. San Valentin, 08302 Mataro - Barcelona, Spain

* <nowiki>[[http://barcelona.travel.spb.ru/hotel/dmz067.htm|Hotel NH Ciutat de Mataró]]</nowiki>, located near the city center.  This is
  where Canonical employees will be staying. We don't yet have an
  exact price but it should be in the range of 80-90€ per night for
  a double room.

'''UPDATE: A lower rate has been negotiated for conference attendees. When making a reservation, mention that you are attending the Canonical Conference and you will be eligible for a rate of 57€ + 7% VAT for a double (twin) room.''' Apparently, this rate does not include breakfast.

'''Hotel phone number is +34 93 7575522'''

* Hotel Colon, located near the city center
  It costs 80,39€ daily (but the Ciutat de Mataro may be nicer). The rate
  includes breakfast.

* Hotel Castell de Mata, located 2 km from the city center. It costs 72,70€
  daily (breakfast included) but is really only accessible by taxi or car. That
  said, taxis are readily available and cheap.

* Youth hostel <nowiki>[[http://www.accac.es/AlbergsMasterC.asp?codi=77|Can Soleret]]</nowiki> located far from the city center. There are buses
  to go there.  The price is approx 16€/day, breakfast included, but they only accept group reservations from at least 15 members.

* You can find more hostels located more or less near to the city center at <nowiki>[[http://www.hostelworld.com/|Hostelworld.com]]</nowiki>. At some
  places there are even some 1-bed private rooms available. Should be an option for everyone, who can't
  afford a hotel room and can't be considered for sponsoring. Prices start at around 20€/day for 1-bed
  private room or 14€/day for a bed in a mixed dorm. Can be booked by Internet.

==== Flying In ====

There are several airports you can fly into: Barcelona (BCN), Girona (GRO), and Rheus (REU). Barcelona will be the easiest in terms of logistics, though you might find cheaper flights to Rheus or Girona.

If you fly to Barcelona airport (also known as El Prat) you can take a train from the airport to Mataró. See further info below.

You could also fly to Girona or Reus. <nowiki>[[http://www.ryanair.com|Ryan Air]]</nowiki>
serves both cities.  Girona is closer (75Km, about
50 minutes by car) to Mataro than
Reus (140Km, about 1:20 minutes by car). Ryan Air offers busses connecting <nowiki>[[http://www.ryanair.co.uk/destinfo03/dests/gir2apt_en.pdf|Girona]]</nowiki> (11€/19€) and <nowiki>[[http://www.ryanair.com/destinfo03/dests/reus_bus_dub.pdf|Reus]]</nowiki> (?€/?€) to Barcelona (PDF). The bus will drop you off in Barcelona, from there you must connect to Mataró - the easiest way being the train. The directions are the same as the train from Barcelona Airport, except you will get on the train at Plaza Catalunya.

From The Netherlands, the best way is probably a http://www.basiqair.nl/ Basiqair] flight from Schiphol to Barcelona, they cost around 110€ for a return ticket, including taxes. You can also fly from Rotterdam to Girona, but those flights seem to start at 60€ (ex. tax) one-way. 

From Paris, Brussels, Roma, Milan, Palma de Mallorca, Seville, Madrid and Bilbao, there are cheap flights with <nowiki>[[http://www.vueling.com/|Vueling]]</nowiki>, which lands at Barceloan Airport. You can get a one way ticket from 20€.

For those flying to the conference, you might want to donate a tree via Future Forests (or a similar online service) to offset C02 emmisions from your flight.

==== Train to Mataro from Barcelona ====

Upon leaving the Barcelona airport, take the overhead walkway to the train, and buy a ticket to Mataró. It takes 1 hour and costs 2.25€ one way. If you plan to travel from Mataró to Barcelona several times during your stay, do not purchase a one way, instead buy a 'T-10 Zone 3' at the airport. A T-10 offers 10 one-way trips, and costs 16.60€. There is only one train that leaves the airport, and all stop at Mataró, so you can't get on the wrong one. Train leaves every half hour, 06:13-22:00.

The Conference is at the Hotel NH Ciutat de Mataró and the hotel is 5-10 minutes away from the train station, walking. Taxis are available all the time at 2-3€.

==== Travel from Mataro to Barcelona ====

To travel from Mataró to Barcelona, your Zone 3 T-10 will let you get off at any point along the light rail in Barcelona. A T-10 also allows transfers to other forms of transport (bus, metro, tram) within 1:45 of the first journey. T-10's are multipersonal, meaning you may legally share them among people, even using one for 10 people at one time.

Trains leave Mataro every 10 to 15 minutes, including the twice hourly train to the airport, which also allows you to disembark in Barcelona. Most will want to exit at Plaza Catalunya, situated in the heart of Barcelona. Wikipedia has an iformative page on <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona|Barcelona]]</nowiki>.

Uphill from Plaza Catanlunya is the <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eixample|Eixample]]</nowiki>, and it's main street Passeig de Gracia, which feature many shops, resaurants, and stores, as well as famous architecture including the <nowiki>[[http://www.igougo.com/planning/journalEntryActivity.asp?JournalID=13542&EntryID=22336&n=Manzana%20de%20la%20Discordia&t=Popular%20Sights|Manzana de Discord]]</nowiki>. Running downhill from P. Catalunya is las Ramblas, which everyone should walk at least once. While walking down las Ramblas, turning left at any point will lead you into the charming and winding streets of Barri Gòtic, the oldest part of Barcelona. Please keep in mind that while Barcelona is a very safe city, pick-pockets are a problem, and wallets/cameras/laptops are frequent targets.

<nowiki>[[http://www.lonelyplanet.com/mapshells/europe/barcelona/barcelona.htm|Lonely Planet]]</nowiki> has a basic map which you can print, which covers most of the area you will want to see as a tourist. 

<nowiki>[[http://www.renfe.es/cercanias/barcelona/img/zonal_barcelona_grande.gif|Map]]</nowiki> of Barcelona Light Rail.

==== What to Bring ====

* a <nowiki>[[http://www.spainconsul-ny.org/%21consula.doi/%21visatou.htm|visa]]</nowiki> for Spain, if you need it. List of <nowiki>[[http://www.asinah.net/spainembassies.html|Spanish Embassies or Consulates]]</nowiki>
* your laptop with wireless capability
* power adaptor for Spanish power, plug is <nowiki>[[http://kropla.com/!c.htm|Zype C]]</nowiki> or <nowiki>[[http://kropla.com/!f.htm|Type F]]</nowiki>, power is 230V at 50 Hz. This is the same as most of Europe (notable exclusions are Great Britain and Switzerland)

==== Recreation/Excursions ====

* Rock-climbers can enjoy an artificial wall in one of Mataró's Parks (20 x 3 meters). Montjuic, in Barcelona, has more free rock-climing, considered by some to be the best in Europe. Tucked behind Poble Espanol on Montjuic, it offers natural rock faces, artificial rock, and a converted road tunnel covered with holds, all of which have bolts to clip into. A <nowiki>[[http://www.tmb.net/img/ampli/13.jpg|bus map]]</nowiki> will help you find it; it is located to the left of "Camp de Rugbe". The map shows a stub of a road that almost connects to the roundabout - this leads into the tunnel. The roundabout is actually above the tunnel, so as you walk along the road make sure you are not above it or pass it by. Look for cars and scooters outside the tunnel.

* Runners may find the Spanish roads crowded and hazardous, but the beach is just minutes away from the center of town, where you can run without risk of being run over.

* A marina is located next to the Mataró train station, where people will be able to find charter boats.

* France is surprisingly close (1.5 hours by car), as is Andorra (2 hours); a rental car may be a good option one weekend.
