=== Ubuntu Open Week - Ubuntu behind the Scenes - Nicolas Valcarcel - Mon, Nov 3rd, 2008 ===

<pre>
(11:01:30 AM) nxvl: who is here to know how ubuntu works under the hood?
(11:01:59 AM) nxvl: ok, let's start
(11:02:24 AM) nxvl: as you might know ubuntu is sponsored by Canonical, and has some Canonical employees working on the distro
(11:02:41 AM) nxvl: but a lot of the work is driven by the community effort
(11:03:15 AM) nxvl: we are not much people in Canonical to manage all the weight of the development
(11:03:21 AM) nxvl: also
(11:03:27 AM) nxvl: we have releases every 6 months
(11:03:30 AM) nxvl: without exceptions
(11:03:35 AM) nxvl: but, how do we do that?
(11:03:57 AM) nxvl: it's a matter of organization and well marked stages on the development
(11:04:04 AM) nxvl: we can't just do whatever we want all the time
(11:04:28 AM) nxvl: we have freezes, milestones and all kind of things that help us have an organized and well structured development
(11:04:54 AM) nxvl: but first we need to understand what our goals are
(11:05:19 AM) nxvl: first thing in the Ubuntu pholosiphy is that it should be available for everyone
(11:05:29 AM) nxvl: any normal user should be able to use it without much pain
(11:05:40 AM) nxvl: also not so normal user should be able too
(11:05:45 AM) nxvl: as gandmas
(11:06:00 AM) nxvl: they are don't understand computers as easy as most of ut
(11:06:21 AM) nxvl: and we need to make our software as easy as we can so they can understand it
(11:06:31 AM) nxvl: also we have a lot of effort in accesibility
(11:07:09 AM) nxvl: that means that there is a whole team working on maintaining toold for people with disorders (as blindness) to be able to use it
(11:07:20 AM) nxvl: also we have a lot of efforts on documentation
(11:07:30 AM) nxvl: so people can find answers easlily
(11:07:52 AM) nxvl: another point of the ubuntu philosiphy is that it should be available in your language
(11:08:06 AM) nxvl: for that we have a large number of translators working on the software
(11:08:25 AM) nxvl: 11:07 < Kolyan_ufalug_> QUESTION: When in Ubuntu there will be a control centre  of system with set of utilities which can work both in  GUI, and in the console?
(11:08:40 AM) nxvl: Kolyan_ufalug_: that a good question and i don't have the answer right now
(11:09:16 AM) nxvl: Kolyan_ufalug_: last UDS we talk about such a tool for server administration that can be easily extended to the desktop
(11:09:27 AM) nxvl: Kolyan_ufalug_: our goal is to have it for 10.04, our next LTS
(11:10:19 AM) nxvl: Kolyan_ufalug_: you can check more info on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuCentralizedServiceAdministrator
(11:10:23 AM) nxvl: help is welcomed
(11:10:48 AM) nxvl: you can contact me for this, since i'm the one behind it
(11:10:51 AM) nxvl: so
(11:11:01 AM) nxvl: we were talking about translations
(11:11:26 AM) nxvl: we have a lot of people working on it
(11:11:35 AM) nxvl: most of that work is being held by LoCo teams
(11:11:44 AM) nxvl: that organize translation sprint
(11:11:54 AM) nxvl: for that we use launchpad
(11:12:05 AM) nxvl: translation.launchpad.net
(11:12:13 AM) nxvl: so it's easier for people wanting to help
(11:12:39 AM) cyphermox: actually, it's translations.launchpad.net
(11:12:44 AM) nxvl: they don't need to handle any code or work directly with .po files, just with strings
(11:12:48 AM) nxvl: cyphermox: thank you!
(11:12:52 AM) ***nxvl HUGS cyphermox 
(11:13:32 AM) nxvl: so
(11:13:44 AM) nxvl: let's dive into the process of a release
(11:14:24 AM) nxvl: 11:14 < bcurtiswx> QUESTION: how much work is being put forward to integrate  things like instant messaging and video/voice chat into the  gnome user interface (like the FUSA for example)
(11:14:30 AM) matthewi_ is now known as isaacsm
(11:14:43 AM) nxvl: bcurtiswx: i don't really know, i'm a server guy not a desktop one
(11:14:56 AM) nxvl: but i think gnome put a lot of effort on that
(11:15:08 AM) nxvl: and empathy is being able to have some video and voice support
(11:15:21 AM) nxvl: i haven't try it yet, but i've read it has
(11:15:33 AM) bcurtiswx: nxvl, ty
(11:15:38 AM) nxvl: so
(11:15:45 AM) nxvl: the release process
(11:15:57 AM) nxvl: as i said before, we have a release every 6 month, with no exceptions
(11:16:20 AM) nxvl: and we have strongly marked stages in the development
(11:16:39 AM) nxvl: all of that stages are hardly influenced by the Gnome Calendar
(11:17:00 AM) nxvl: as we have Gnome as our primarly desktop we somehow depend of them
(11:17:29 AM) nxvl: (if someone send me a private mesage please resend)
(11:18:09 AM) nxvl: 11:17 < cybernoutles> QUESTION : how would ubuntu server fit into the new idea  of "cloud computing" can ubuntu server run services like  programs , or total ubuntu desktops from a server to an  terminal over the net?
(11:18:19 AM) nxvl: cybernoutles: we are putting efforts on that
(11:18:54 AM) nxvl: so, yes it will fit in the near future if it doesn't fit now, but a better place to ask that is in mathiaz's session
(11:19:40 AM) nxvl: which is tomorrow at 18 UTC
(11:20:01 AM) nxvl: <sloopy> does this mandated release schedule ever compromise the quality  of a given release?
(11:20:05 AM) nxvl: igor_: please stop that
(11:20:42 AM) nxvl: sloopy: no it doesn't and you will see why in a bit :D
(11:21:20 AM) nxvl: so
(11:21:32 AM) nxvl: the first stage: Planification
(11:22:03 AM) nxvl: we start a development cycle planificating what are we going to do
(11:22:30 AM) nxvl: we propose new features and give them a strategic priority in the distribution
(11:22:57 AM) nxvl: thos proposal are being done by the community using brainstorm (brainstorm.ubuntu.com)
(11:23:15 AM) nxvl: but they need a developer to adopt them so they can be done
(11:23:32 AM) nxvl: actually anyone can adopt an idea and develop/deploy it
(11:23:44 AM) nxvl: and then it will become a developer
(11:23:53 AM) nxvl: so if you have some ideas send them to brainstorm
(11:23:59 AM) nxvl: and develop/deploy them
(11:25:22 AM) nxvl: 11:21 < kippy> QUESTION: Like UbuntuOpenWeek and UbuntuDeveloperWeek do we have  some sessions that help the users learn how ubuntu works (as an  operating system as opposed to community)?  Don't you think this  kind of session that explains the inner workings of Ubuntu as an  operating system, that would help breed geeks who can contribute  to certain sections of the community better?
(11:26:12 AM) nxvl: well, that's why UbuntuOpenWeek and UbuntuDeveloperWeek are for
(11:26:21 AM) nxvl: we also have LoCo team running events locally
(11:26:25 AM) nxvl: and some QA sessions
(11:26:30 AM) nxvl: and ubuntu classroom
(11:26:42 AM) nxvl: we try to cover everything
(11:26:58 AM) nxvl: and if we don't feel free to run some or send us your ideas to cover them
(11:27:01 AM) nxvl: :D
(11:28:27 AM) nxvl: 11:28 < kippy> QUESTION (FOLLOWUP): nxvl, have lots of requests for such  sessions, where to post them?
(11:28:39 AM) nxvl: you should ping our ubuntu-classroom dean and discuss them
(11:28:50 AM) nxvl: sfor that james_w will we your guy
(11:29:07 AM) nxvl: we also have ubuntu-classroom mailing list
(11:29:32 AM) nxvl: so
(11:29:36 AM) nxvl: about planification
(11:30:04 AM) nxvl: we meet each 6 months on the Ubuntu Developer Submit to discuss our ideas
(11:30:24 AM) knome: nxvl, *planning :]
(11:30:31 AM) nxvl: this time we are going to have it on MountainView California, and google offices
(11:30:35 AM) nxvl: knome: yes, that, sorry
(11:30:35 AM) nxvl: :D
(11:30:39 AM) nxvl: not native english speaker
(11:31:08 AM) nxvl: it will be from 8th to 12 December
(11:31:25 AM) nxvl: everyone is welcome to come
(11:31:29 AM) nxvl: it's an open event
(11:31:48 AM) nxvl: where you can help plan Jaunty (out next release)
(11:32:12 AM) nxvl: we have 1 hour BoF session
(11:32:46 AM) nxvl: where we discuss the proposed ideas, after that discussion we write the blueprints
(11:32:55 AM) nxvl: and start developing new feautures
(11:33:11 AM) nxvl: we have that every 6 months as i said before
(11:33:19 AM) ***x_dimitri is quite surprised that nxvl is not a native english speaker
(11:33:59 AM) nxvl: and if you aren't able to travel you can always go into the IRC channels we have for UDS and/or use VOIP
(11:34:09 AM) nxvl: or the streaming of the sessions
(11:34:18 AM) Tolchi: ty nxvl
(11:34:27 AM) nxvl: so you can hear everything we discuss and/or give us ideas comments by IRC
(11:34:27 AM) Tolchi: gracias nicolas
(11:34:38 AM) nxvl: 11:33 < cybernoutles> QUESTION : how much effect  does ubuntu brainstorm have  on the planning of next releases? Is that the best way to  influence the way ubuntu goes, or are there other options
(11:34:59 AM) nxvl: cybernoutles: a lot, before UDS and while we wait for new archives to open, we do brainstorm triaging
(11:35:27 AM) nxvl: where we see what new ideas are posted
(11:35:50 AM) nxvl: and we develop the list of the best to be taken in account and discuss them at UDS
(11:35:57 AM) nxvl: so
(11:36:11 AM) nxvl: after we have plan, discuss on UDS and write down the spects
(11:36:17 AM) nxvl: the development starts
(11:36:25 AM) nxvl: first stage of the development is Merging
(11:36:34 AM) nxvl: where we sync our repos with debian ones
(11:36:53 AM) nxvl: for that we take the package we haven't touch from debian, that's called a sync
(11:37:21 AM) nxvl: or we take the new debian package, patch it with our changes and upload the new ubuntu version, that's called a merge
(11:37:58 AM) nxvl: we also find us at some points where we have a modified ubuntu package that has all of it's changes already applied by upstream or by debian
(11:38:02 AM) nxvl: then we sync them too
(11:38:11 AM) nxvl: the idea is to have almost all the package just synced
(11:38:21 AM) nxvl: that save us a lot of work we can use in another thing
(11:38:40 AM) nxvl: so if you make a patch or a change it would be a really good idea to send it back to upstream
(11:38:55 AM) nxvl: 11:37 < bcurtiswx> QUESTION: (for testers), is it at this point (the debain  sync) that the most breakage can happen?
(11:38:58 AM) nxvl: bcurtiswx: yes
(11:38:58 AM) nxvl: :D
(11:39:12 AM) nxvl: in the merge time the development release breakes a lot
(11:39:43 AM) nxvl: so, after merges time the feature development start
(11:39:57 AM) nxvl: (actually it starts in the merge stage, but you got the idea)
(11:40:07 AM) nxvl: at this point we can't sync or merge with debian anymore
(11:40:18 AM) nxvl: and you will need to ask for a Freeze exception to to so
(11:40:27 AM) nxvl: just in the cases that it's needed
(11:40:49 AM) nxvl: in this stage we start developing the new feature discussed at UDS and with an approved blueprint
(11:41:00 AM) nxvl: after that we have the feature freeze
(11:41:05 AM) nxvl: where no more development can be done
(11:41:16 AM) nxvl: at that stage almost all the package must be usable and in a good shape
(11:41:36 AM) nxvl: this goes in the 17th week of the development
(11:41:43 AM) nxvl: then we start to fix bugs
(11:41:58 AM) nxvl: 11:41 < telebovich> QUESTION: Why Ubuntu has 6 month developing cycle?
(11:42:05 AM) nxvl: telebovich: because Gnome is
(11:42:05 AM) nxvl: :D
(11:42:10 AM) nxvl: 11:41 < weboide> QUESTION: when is situated the beta release?
(11:42:18 AM) nxvl: weboide: i will got into that soon
(11:42:31 AM) nxvl: 11:42 < Yasumoto> QUESTION: How often is the Debian freeze broken to allow for  new syncs? Is it relatively easy?
(11:42:41 AM) nxvl: Yasumoto: you mean debian freeze expetions?
(11:42:55 AM) nxvl: exceptions*
(11:42:56 AM) Yasumoto: yep
(11:43:06 AM) nxvl: it's not a hard process
(11:43:18 AM) nxvl: you just need to have a rationale of why
(11:43:26 AM) nxvl: for universe it's quite easy
(11:43:34 AM) nxvl: for main it's a little harder
(11:43:45 AM) nxvl: but, no it's not hard or painful at all
(11:43:55 AM) nxvl: so, then we start developing new stuff
(11:43:58 AM) Yasumoto: alright, sweet. makes sense, thanks :)
(11:44:11 AM) nxvl: and we have the Ubuntu Developer Sprint
(11:44:27 AM) nxvl: for that spring only the developers that need to finish something are supposed to attend
(11:44:54 AM) nxvl: it's a week where canonical put all the developers together to don't get any distraction and finish their stuff for the release
(11:45:50 AM) nxvl: after that we have the feature freeze
(11:45:52 AM) nxvl: where no new features can go in
(11:45:56 AM) nxvl: that's on the 17th week as i said before
(11:46:39 AM) nxvl: 11:45 < Tina_Russell> QUESTION: How much of Ubuntu is synced back into Debian  in turn?
(11:46:39 AM) nxvl: Tina_Russell: all that fits
(11:46:39 AM) nxvl: Tina_Russell: and we try to make it all
(11:46:39 AM) nxvl: after the feature freeze we start hunting bugs
(11:46:40 AM) nxvl: and 2 weeks after that we have the User interface freeze
(11:46:40 AM) nxvl: where interfaces can't be changed
(11:46:44 AM) nxvl: so the documentation team can take screenshots for their documents
(11:46:45 AM) nxvl: :D
(11:46:54 AM) nxvl: 11:46 < igor_> QUESTION: How do you manage packages that are orphaned in Debian  ?
(11:47:02 AM) nxvl: igor_: we fix them and send patches back
(11:47:24 AM) nxvl: the next freeze in place is the Beta Freeze
(11:47:32 AM) nxvl: wich is the 21th week
(11:47:46 AM) nxvl: after that we start to fix high priority bugs
(11:47:58 AM) nxvl: and start getting the final release into shape
(11:48:36 AM) nxvl: 11:47 < telebovich> QUESTION: if the team find some improvement that worth to  add in the version after freez time, do they change the  code or UI?
(11:48:51 AM) nxvl: telebovich: you need a freeze exception with a rationale that worth it
(11:49:04 AM) nxvl: 11:48 < syslogd> QUESTION: Ubuntu Mobile is based on GNOME, right? Do the  changes reflux into the main project (-> GNOME) so that there  are going to be other distributions that focus on those mobile  computers?
(11:49:08 AM) nxvl: syslogd: AFAIK, yes
(11:49:18 AM) nxvl: 11:48 < xjazz> QUESTION: What about kde-devel guys. Is comfortable they to  adapt for planing, depend on ubuntu and gnome schedule?
(11:49:24 AM) nxvl: xjazz: i think they are, yes
(11:49:41 AM) nxvl: so
(11:49:49 AM) nxvl: after beta freeze we start testing
(11:50:17 AM) nxvl: we have a beta release, then a RC and images being builded for massive testing
(11:50:29 AM) nxvl: 11:49 < bhk_f> QUESTION: what kind of changes is ubuntu doing to vanilla kernel
(11:50:40 AM) nxvl: bhk_f: don't really know i don't touch the kernel at all
(11:50:55 AM) nxvl: then a lot of effort on testing is being done
(11:51:07 AM) nxvl: so we can be sure all the worst bugs are fixed
(11:51:15 AM) nxvl: then, we have the final freeze
(11:51:22 AM) nxvl: where only showstopper bugs are fixed
(11:51:29 AM) nxvl: and a lot of testing is being done
(11:51:42 AM) nxvl: and then we have a release
(11:51:52 AM) nxvl: all the parties start all around the world
(11:52:00 AM) nxvl: and we are have nice CD's comming to our houses
(11:52:08 AM) thiebaude: yup
(11:52:09 AM) nxvl: but, what about bugs in the stable release?
(11:52:14 AM) nxvl: we have a process called SRU's
(11:52:26 AM) nxvl: which stands for Stable Release Update
(11:52:47 AM) nxvl: that goes to the ubuntu-sru team, motu-sru and sru-verification teams
(11:53:06 AM) nxvl: if we fix something in a stable release we need to ask for those teams to review it
(11:53:27 AM) nxvl: and if they are accepted we can have it in our main repos
(11:53:27 AM) thiebaude: QUESTION:has a SRU been done for 8.10?
(11:53:39 AM) nxvl: thiebaude: yes, we already have some
(11:53:39 AM) nxvl: :D
(11:53:55 AM) nxvl: SRU's are mostly for security vulnerabilities, severe regressions
(11:54:03 AM) nxvl: and user data lost
(11:54:11 AM) nxvl: and all kind of ugly bugs
(11:54:26 AM) thiebaude: nxvl:QUESTION:what is your ubuntu xpertise?
(11:54:45 AM) nxvl: 11:51 < gourgi> QUESTION: if the high priority bugs aren't fix until final  release what happens next? do they are re-assigned for next  release ?
(11:54:56 AM) nxvl: gourgi: that SRU's :D
(11:55:13 AM) nxvl: 11:52 < igor_> QUESTION: Ubuntu aimed to be as synced to Debian as possible  (technicaly). Are there points available in the DFSG (Debian  Free Software Guideline) and/or the Social Contract that are not  synced with Ubuntu aims ?
(11:55:38 AM) nxvl: igor_: we stick to DFSG for packaging our stuff with some exceptions
(11:55:45 AM) nxvl: so almost all of our work is debian compilant
(11:56:05 AM) nxvl: 11:54 < kippy> QUESTION: Like there is a problem with Intel 845 integrated  graphics chip (and many others) and compiz in 8.10, so according  to the cycle, can we hope to see a fix for this in 8.10 or do we  have to wait till jaunty
(11:56:29 AM) nxvl: kippy: we can hope to get a fix, but that's kernel, so ask that question to ogasawara in next session
(11:56:32 AM) nxvl: :D
(11:56:42 AM) nxvl: thiebaude: i'm a server team guy
(11:56:46 AM) nxvl: thiebaude: and a security guy
(11:56:57 AM) thiebaude: nxvl:kewl
(11:56:58 AM) nxvl: ok, so i think i have time for one more question
(11:57:04 AM) nxvl: ogasawara: have i?
(11:57:16 AM) nxvl: 11:56 < biomass> QUESTION: Is there a difference in preparing for a LTS release  compared to the releases inbetween LTS ?
(11:57:19 AM) ogasawara: nxvl: go for it
(11:57:21 AM) nxvl: biomass: oh yes, it is
(11:57:35 AM) nxvl: biomass: for LTS we are more carefull on what we have into it
(11:57:58 AM) nxvl: biomass: and we have a lot more of carefull on what new stuff to add to it
(11:58:05 AM) nxvl: but for the schedule is the same
(11:58:05 AM) thiebaude: nxvl:QUESTION:how long is 8.04 supported?
(11:58:21 AM) nxvl: 11:57 < syslogd> QUESTION: Will there be a rolling-release version of Ubuntu?
(11:58:37 AM) nxvl: syslogd: i don't get your question? how rolling-release?
(11:58:45 AM) jcastro: let's wrap it up!
(11:58:50 AM) nxvl: ok
(11:58:54 AM) nxvl: i'm out of time
(11:58:59 AM) nxvl: thank you guys for attending
