=== Register your Music Application ===

In order to integrate your music application with the Unity Sound Menu, you will need first register it by creating a new libunity <code>MusicPlayer</code> instance from inside your program:
<pre>
 var player = new MusicPlayer ("rhythmbox.desktop");
</pre>
Once your application has been registered, the Sound Menu will keep it's entry in the menu even after it has been closed, giving users a quick way to launch it again.

=== Setting current track information ===

When your application is running, you can send the Sound Menu information about the current track by creating a new <code>TrackMetadata</code> instance and setting it to the <code>current_track</code> attribute of the <code>MusicPlayer</code> instance you created:
<pre>
      TrackMetadata metadata = new TrackMetadata();
      metadata.artist = "Autechre";
      metadata.album = "LP5";
      metadata.title = "Rae";
      player.current_track = metadata;
</pre>

=== Adding Playlists ===

If your application supports playlists, you can display them in the Sound Menu to let the user switch between them. 

<pre>
var player = new MusicPlayer ("rhythmbox.desktop");
    Playlist pl = new Playlist ("fake-pl-id");
    pl.name = "yellow swans like";
    pl.icon = Icon. new_for_string("audio-volume-high");

    player.add_playlist(pl);  
</pre>
You then need connect your application listed to the <code>activate_playlist</code> signal of the <code>MusicPlayer</code>.  Each playlist should have a unique id string, as this will be passed to your callback function when the user selects it from the Sound Menu.  You can also give your playlist a name and custom icon to be displayed.

You can also set a specific playlist as being used:
<pre>
    player.current_playlist = pl;
</pre>
