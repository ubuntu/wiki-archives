=== Summary ===

This project is simply a branch of the <nowiki>[[http://github.com/twenrich/xmp-manager/tree/master|XMP-Manager]]</nowiki> project on Github.

=== Release Note ===

* Updated workflow script:
** Added automatic detection of home directory.
** Added automatic detection of fullname based on linux username info. Use the fullname for copyright notices.
* Updated the algorithm for writing changes to the disk - only launch exiftool once for all changes... This can be up to 10x faster than before.
* Added geocoding feature and hacked a Google Maps preview of the long/lat.
* Implemented dateshift feature.
* Altered the workflow algorithm to use a new naming convention: adding full date field (YYmmddHHMMSS) at the end of the name makes for better alphabetical sorting and more effecient use of counters when merging multiple photos with the same title.
* Fixed a bug that prevented updating of date field.
* Added a progress bar for the updating of tags on disk.
* General clean-up of unused files

=== Rationale ===

Decided to use Launchpad instead of git due to its built-in PPA feature that allows for easier deployment to Ubuntu machines. This feature has not yet been implemented though...
