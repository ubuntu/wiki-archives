 16:02 <meetingology> 

 16:02 <meetingology> Available commands: action commands idea info link nick

 16:02 <rharper> #topic Review ACTION points from previous meeting

 16:02 <rharper> previous agenda looks the same, nacc's out this week, so I'll just carry those

 16:02 <rharper> #action nacc to write a release notes entry on ipv6 netboot (carried over)

 16:02 * meetingology nacc to write a release notes entry on ipv6 netboot (carried over)

 16:03 <cpaelzer> yes

 16:03 <rharper> #action nacc to write a server guide entry on ipv6 netboot (carried over)

 16:03 * meetingology nacc to write a server guide entry on ipv6 netboot (carried over)

 16:03 <cpaelzer> and yours likely as well?

 16:03 <rharper> rbasak is not here as well, so carry

 16:03 <rharper> well

 16:03 <rharper> I *did* do one of them

 16:03 <cpaelzer> yay++

 16:03 <rharper> so, gonna mark that complete

 16:03 <cpaelzer> rbasak was around

 16:03 <cpaelzer> let's ping him "at home"

 16:03 <rharper> k

 16:04 <rharper> I'll carry it and then mark it done if the answer differs

 16:04 <rharper> #action rbasak to add maintainership info to mysql triage page (carried over)

 16:04 * meetingology rbasak to add maintainership info to mysql triage page (carried over)

 16:04 <rharper> #done rharper to write a release notes entry on v2 yaml support in cloud-init

 16:05 <rharper> on the serverguide, there wasn't much of a section on cloud-init so wasn't sure what to do about that

 16:05 <rharper> so I'll carry for now

 16:05 <rharper> #action rharper to write a server guide entry on v2 yaml support in cloud-init (carried over)

 16:05 * meetingology rharper to write a server guide entry on v2 yaml support in cloud-init (carried over)

 16:05 <rharper> ok

 16:06 <rharper> rbasak: I marked your previous task as carry-over, is that accurate ?

 16:07 <rharper> I'll assume so and you can correct me later if needed

 16:07 <rharper> #topic Artful Development

 16:07 <rharper> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArtfulAardvark/ReleaseSchedule

 16:07 <rbasak> rharper: that's correct, thanks.

 16:07 <rharper> rbasak: great!

 16:07 <smoser> o/

 16:07 <rharper> #subtopic blueprints

 16:08 <rharper> #link https://trello.com/b/U9HhWyT0/daily-ubuntu-server

 16:08 <rharper> any update to current work that needs discussion ?

 16:08 <cpaelzer> actually the blueprints are replaced by the non daiyl board

 16:08 <cpaelzer> let me fetch the link

 16:08 <ahasenack> I think just the meeting subtopic is named incorrectly

 16:08 <ahasenack> the link looks correct

 16:08 <cpaelzer> https://trello.com/b/8bC9VQMk/server-backlog

 16:08 <rharper> I have the link, but the subtopic is from the paste

 16:08 <rharper> lemme put the bp link and then switch subtopics

 16:09 <cpaelzer> well we have the short and the longterm one - I think it is fair to link up both from the meeting

 16:09 <rharper> #subtopic Current Work

 16:09 <cpaelzer> to give the full view

 16:09 <rharper> the backlog one ?

 16:09 <rharper> #link https://trello.com/b/8bC9VQMk/server-backlog

 16:09 <rharper> we have both, and can fix up the actions

 16:09 <cpaelzer> the old blueprint split into daily and backlog - which together are a superset of the old

 16:09 <rharper> #action rharper to update irc cut-n-paste links to point to trello pages

 16:09 * meetingology rharper to update irc cut-n-paste links to point to trello pages

 16:10 <rharper> ok, any backlog discussion needed ?

 16:10 <rharper> #subtopic Release Bugs

 16:10 <cpaelzer> no changes incoming atm afaik

 16:10 <cpaelzer> (on the backlog)

 16:10 <rharper> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-aa-tracking-bug-tasks.html#ubuntu-server

 16:10 <rharper> cpaelzer: thanks

 16:11 <rharper> anything hot here ?

 16:11 <cpaelzer> one general question

 16:11 <cpaelzer> slashd: who is now Mr. sosreport?

 16:11 <cpaelzer> it seems you on one of the bugs found in the link above - is that the case?

 16:12 <slashd> cpaelzer, well I'm taking care of it, and have monthly meeting with stokachu

 16:12 <cpaelzer> ok, thanks

 16:13 <cpaelzer> didn't know that stokachu is intertwinded with sosreport

 16:13 <cpaelzer> on the django bug - that is in proposed - nacc can share more next week when he is available

 16:13 <rharper> ok

 16:13 <cpaelzer> maybe it even migrated until then

 16:13 <slashd> cpaelzer, he is upstream/ubuntu, sosreport is crucial for us, so I decide to take the lead on this for our team

 16:14 <cpaelzer> ok, good to know

 16:14 <slashd> and work with him on this to merge package in a regular basis when needed to fix bug

 16:14 <rharper> #info stokachu is upstream/ubuntu for sosreport package

 16:14 <rharper> #topic Server & Cloud Bugs & SRU/Pending Uploads (slashd, ddstreet)

 16:14 <slashd> Business as usual for us, here's the SRUs we are currently working on : https://pastebin.canonical.com/193745/ , other than that I have nothing special to report this week.

 16:16 <ahasenack> slashd: what is the rsyslog sru?

 16:16 <ahasenack> time jumps

 16:21 <rharper> ok, moving forward

 16:21 <rharper> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (powersj)

 16:21 <rharper> #link https://jenkins.ubuntu.com/server/

 16:21 <powersj> Last week lots of time spent on the KVM backend for cloud-init testing. This week more of the same.

 16:21 <powersj> questions?

 16:21 <rharper> \o/

 16:21 <rharper> when/where can I try it ?

 16:22 <rharper> branch, jenkins job?

 16:22 <powersj> https://code.launchpad.net/~powersj/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+ref/cii-kvm

 16:22 <powersj> there is the branch ^

 16:22 <cpaelzer> powersj: x86 only for now?

 16:22 <powersj> cpaelzer: yes

 16:22 <cpaelzer> how much more lockup when virt tests run?

 16:22 <cpaelzer> so how much workload in hours?

 16:23 <powersj> heh not sure yet, I have the backend working, but I need to spend time on test cases to utilize the new features

 16:23 <rharper> #link https://code.launchpad.net/~powersj/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+ref/cii-kvm

 16:23 <cpaelzer> sure

 16:23 <rharper> #info cloud-init integration testing with KVM backend in progress

 16:24 <rharper> powersj: did the curtin vmtests run last night ?

 16:24 * rharper hasn't looked

 16:24 <powersj> rharper: ah yes all passed, except daily-t due to bcache

 16:24 <rharper> my manual run on our developement system passed all tests

 16:24 <teward> (i'm late again sorry)

 16:24 <rharper> powersj: ok, good; that's more normal

 16:25 <rharper> I think the bcache on trusty might be the TOCTOU bug I filed

 16:25 <rharper> typically happens under load only

 16:25 <rharper> bug #1700564

 16:25 <ubottu> bug 1700564 in curtin "under heavy IO encounter TOCTOU bug with bcache removal" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1700564

 16:25 <rharper> any other questions for powersj ?

 16:26 <rharper> previous week there was some discussion on seed changes?

 16:26 <rharper> cpaelzer: powersj any update here ?

 16:26 <powersj> ah I misspoke, wasn't seed change

 16:26 <rharper> ah

 16:26 <rharper> ok

 16:26 <powersj> sounded as if a dependency change pulled more things in, no update though

 16:27 <cpaelzer> seed changes were about virt- tasks

 16:27 <cpaelzer> they are done, waiting on aa to remove some packages, that is all

 16:27 <rharper> ok

 16:27 <cpaelzer> that is https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1540323

 16:27 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1540323 in ubuntu-virt (Ubuntu) "ubuntu-virt is not generated from seeds" [Undecided,Triaged]

 16:27 <rharper> #info seed changes are done, waiting on an AA to remove some packages

 16:28 <rharper> cpaelzer: thanks

 16:28 <rharper> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb, sforshee)

 16:28 <smb> Or was that about nplan and libnss-resolve not being pulled in by the same meta? That is in kind of works

 16:28 <smb> or systemd-netword has to be fixed to work without libnss-resolve

 16:29 <smb> Anyhow for kernel. Been distracted with other things, so only can say artful kernel is 4.11 now and intention for release is to be 4.13... Any questions?

 16:29 <rharper> smb: mmm, systemd fun

 16:29 <smb> a source of much fun... :-P

 16:29 <rharper> "fun"

 16:29 <rharper> yes, I need more of that

 16:30 <rharper> smb: was there a bug for the libnss-resolve/systemd-networkd/nplan path ?

 16:30 <smb> yes

 16:30 <smb> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/systemd/+bug/1703640

 16:30 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1703640 in systemd (Ubuntu) "nplan and libnss-resolve should be in same dependency" [Medium,Triaged]

 16:30 <rharper> excellent, thanks

 16:30 <rharper> any other questions for smb ?

 16:31 <rharper> #topic Upcoming Call For Papers

 16:31 <rharper> #link https://lwn.net/Calendar/Monthly/cfp/

 16:31 <rharper> any paper submissions or new venues to discuss ?

 16:32 <rharper> #topic Ubuntu Server Team Events

 16:32 <cpaelzer> better late than never, on the topic before "systemd fun" FYI 234 is in proposed

 16:32 <cpaelzer> and fixes one of my issues, so it is fun this time

 16:32 <rharper> well, that's got to be better than 232 and 233

 16:33 <rharper> no team events to announce yet

 16:33 <rharper> ok

 16:33 <rharper> #topic Open Discussion

 16:33 <rharper> fire away

 16:33 <smb> rharper, as you asked for more systemd "fun": here you go: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/systemd/+bug/1703882

 16:33 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1703882 in systemd (Ubuntu) "systemd-networkd does not pick up dns-search from DHCP" [Undecided,New]

 16:33 <rharper> that's no fun

 16:33 <smb> though might be fixed in the new version, I have not yet looked

 16:34 <rharper> I suspect AA under MAAS is going to be interesting

 16:34 <smb> the interesting as in "interesting times"

 16:34 <rharper> indeed

 16:35 <rharper> there doesn't seem to be anything up for discussion so I'll go ahead and close

 16:35 <rharper> #topic Announce next meeting date, time and chair

 16:35 <rharper> chair will be powersj

 16:35 <powersj> \o/

 16:35 <rharper> meeting sametime a week from now, minus 35 minutes
