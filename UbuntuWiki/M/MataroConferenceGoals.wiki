__TOC__

== Hardware Support ==

** Hardware diversity testing: get those Sounders going!  Sounder launch Monday 08/09
** Keyboard maps
** Issues with multiple NICs

== Desktop Usability ==

** See if we can handle hotplugged storage devices sensibly
** Can we support modern video playback at all?
** Bug reporting facilities (bug-buddy? reportbug?)
** Making basic administrator functionality available to the user in a straightforward way (rebooting, gnome-system-tools stuff, etc.)

== Installer ==

** Create apt archive on target disk and copy .debs into it to avoid CD access after installation (Mark's idea from a week or two ago)
** Default partitioner to eating whole disk, but make sure it's possible to back out
