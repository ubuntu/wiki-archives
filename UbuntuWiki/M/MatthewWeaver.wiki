__TOC__

== MatthewWeaver ==

Ahoy, this page should probably exist (at least as much as I do).

=== About Me, Matthew Weaver ===

* You can read more about me here: http://www.ice-nine.org/matt/
* You can send me crypted mail or check my signatures with PGP keyid 000126E3 (it is on all the usual keyservers)
* I once carried solar panels up a mountain to install a wireless network repeater
* I have used Debian for a long time on my desktop and Ubuntu (exclusively) since an early Sounder release of [WartyWarthog]
* I help when and how I can (I am somewhat good at many things, and very good at few things)
** I have parried double-entendres with [ColinWatson]
** I file bug reports and whine about missing features
** I harass friends until they understand that Ubuntu is the Right Way
** Once I had an idea that [MattZimmerman] called 'pretty reasonable'

=== Ubuntu Linux Hopes ===

* I want to see pfctl ported to ipfilter/iptables
* I want to see Ubuntu-based embedded derivations bolster/replace projects like Pebble and Voyage
