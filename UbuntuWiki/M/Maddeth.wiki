====== Madsmeg ======

I have been using Ubuntu as my sole OS (aside from other Linux based distro's now and again) for a year, and using Ubuntu since end of December 2005 as such i feel i know my way around it.

I am living in the UK, based in South Wales (which is not England by-the-way), doing a degree in computer forensics.

I am not a big poster in the forums, although joining the forums in Dec 2005, usually all questions are answered by the time i get there, but i do have a good knowledge base when i dig deep enough.

I help to maintain the UGA (Ubuntu Gamers Arena) and consistently contribute to #ubuntuforums-beginners IRC (whether relevant or not).

I am known as Maddeth on IRC and Madsmeg in the forums dont hesitate to PM me i will help all i can, i help better on a 1 to 1 basis.
