=== About Me ===

Well, I'm from near London, UK. I have an interest in both computing and marketing, and enjoy interacting with people, finding better ways to do things, and working as a team. I have used Ubuntu for over a year now, and computers for many years. 

=== How to help me ===

We need people to join the Marketing team! And, personally, I need people to help out with the SpreadUbuntu.org website. If you have skills in web design/development, please contact me:

Without the spaces! 

Thanks everyone

Matt Harwood
