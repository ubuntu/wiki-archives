<pre>
(01:58:27 PM) bethlynn: I am Beth Lynn Eicher of the Ohio LinuxFest. For the past 10 years I have been involved in user group activities
(01:58:43 PM) bethlynn: I am distro agnostic
(01:58:53 PM) bethlynn: I use Ubuntu, SUSE, RHEL, Fedora
(02:06:30 PM) bethlynn1: I am a professional system administrator who does not code
(02:06:31 PM) bethlynn1: so
(02:06:49 PM) bethlynn1: hacking on a bug is something that is unfamiliar to me
(02:06:52 PM) bethlynn1: however,
(02:07:07 PM) bethlynn1: I am working on the biggest, most challenging bug, bug one
(02:07:19 PM) bethlynn1: Microsoft has majority market share
(02:07:44 PM) bethlynn1: When I first saw this bug file a few years ago, I was actually a little upset by it
(02:08:02 PM) bethlynn1: because I was in an environment where bug one actually was resolved
(02:08:43 PM) bethlynn1: I was working for Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science which has deployed Linux on the desktop for almost 15 years
(02:09:20 PM) bethlynn1: The truth of the matter is that Microsoft is relatively new to the market place in the span of computing history.
(02:09:45 PM) bethlynn1: The year is 2009. Unix is 40 years old.
(02:10:18 PM) bethlynn1: And in the beginning, it was assumed that you would share your source code
(02:11:19 PM) bethlynn1: This is why Richard Stallman was so annoyed in 1981 when he was told that he could have access to a printer driver code due to an non-disclosure agreement
(02:12:10 PM) bethlynn1: it is due to Marketing that the Microsoft operating systems are seen as the way things have always been
(02:12:17 PM) bethlynn1: and how they will always be
(02:12:38 PM) bethlynn1: Apple computer has done their own marketing to rebut this
(02:31:21 PM) The topic for #ubuntu-classroom is: Welcome to Ubuntu Open Week! https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuOpenWeek (changes made, please check regularly) || Session:     Resolving Bug One - BethLynnEicher    || All questions go in #ubuntu-classroom-chat
(02:31:36 PM) bethlynn1: it is possible, but increasingly unlikely that the Ubuntu Mulitverse lacks a package to do at least something close to X
(02:32:04 PM) bethlynn1: sometimes you need to conceed that their isn't a tool that does X
(02:32:19 PM) bethlynn1: examine if it works in Wine
(02:32:27 PM) bethlynn1: or if Crossover will support it
(02:33:23 PM) bethlynn1: if you can't find a package that does X, post the problem to a mailing list somewhere
(02:33:50 PM) bethlynn1: that gets into the internet search enginies
(02:34:04 PM) bethlynn1: that allows you tell the world that this bug is out there
(02:34:19 PM) bethlynn1: a question for the Ubuntu community
(02:34:31 PM) bethlynn1: please answer in -chat
(02:34:55 PM) bethlynn1: is there some way that people can file another bug and attach it as related to bug one
(02:34:58 PM) bethlynn1: thanks
(02:35:17 PM) bethlynn1: one more point about "It can't do X" before I more on
(02:35:52 PM) bethlynn1: Setting realistic expectations for those new to Linux before they see it is important
(02:36:08 PM) bethlynn1: Shawn Powers discussed this at his Ohio LinuxFest 2009 keynote
(02:36:26 PM) bethlynn1: People, at least Americans,
(02:36:48 PM) bethlynn1: have a negative idea of what "free" really gets you
(02:37:39 PM) bethlynn1: If you tell people the bad news up front then you make the experience of when the get to the keyboard up to the software to prove itself
(02:38:15 PM) bethlynn1: For example,
(02:38:38 PM) bethlynn1: if I was suggesting Linux for someone who does US Tax preparation
(02:39:19 PM) bethlynn1: I would tell that person that the shirk-wrapped software that is bought in the electronic store is likely not to work
(02:39:46 PM) bethlynn1: then I would see if there is a web-based alternative
(02:40:06 PM) bethlynn1: and if alternatives would be acceptable to the user
(02:40:28 PM) bethlynn1: What I have seen,
(02:40:55 PM) bethlynn1: when I give a person a Linux computer, they are actually quite happy about the experience
(02:41:09 PM) bethlynn1: and it strengthens relationships
(02:41:24 PM) bethlynn1: because you start with the relationships of what you already have
(02:41:34 PM) bethlynn1: and what you already have in common
(02:41:47 PM) bethlynn1: if there are people who look like you
(02:41:50 PM) bethlynn1: and talk like you
(02:41:56 PM) bethlynn1: who are using a product
(02:42:07 PM) bethlynn1: it gives a great deal of legitimacy
(02:42:23 PM) bethlynn1: this is why it is important for diversity
(02:42:49 PM) bethlynn1: I spend the majority of my time when I give a computer away to women
(02:42:55 PM) bethlynn1: because I am a woman
(02:43:36 PM) bethlynn1: I do tell men about how great Linux and free software is too
(02:44:20 PM) bethlynn1: but it is easier for me to speak the language for a woman to another woman
(02:44:32 PM) bethlynn1: than a man to a woman or vice versa
(02:44:39 PM) bethlynn1: there are other diversity groups
(02:44:49 PM) bethlynn1: that I can't discuss here, out of interest of time
(02:45:11 PM) bethlynn1: but the quick answer is to start in the neighbourhoods you already work in
(02:45:28 PM) bethlynn1: and network with your friends there
(02:45:50 PM) bethlynn1: the Zareason folks use the phrase "Friends help Friends use Linux"
(02:45:55 PM) bethlynn1: good stuff
(02:45:58 PM) bethlynn1: Now
(02:46:06 PM) bethlynn1: since I only have 15 minutes left
(02:46:18 PM) bethlynn1: I will discuss where Microsoft has majority market share
(02:46:48 PM) bethlynn1: I have been blogging on whatwillweuse.com with maco since July 2009
(02:46:59 PM) bethlynn1: abut where Microsoft has market share
(02:47:03 PM) bethlynn1: and it's status
(02:47:31 PM) bethlynn1: through this discussion, there are only three places where we have found that Microsoft can make the claim
(02:47:37 PM) bethlynn1: 1. Operating system
(02:47:43 PM) bethlynn1: 2. Browser
(02:47:48 PM) bethlynn1: 3. Office Suite
(02:48:31 PM) bethlynn1: Installing Ubuntu instead of Windows resolves the desktop operating system issue
(02:48:39 PM) bethlynn1: to be absolutely clear
(02:48:56 PM) bethlynn1: Microsoft only has majority market share in the desktop operating system area
(02:49:00 PM) bethlynn1: not in servers
(02:49:13 PM) bethlynn1: not in high performance computing
(02:49:17 PM) bethlynn1: not in embedded
(02:49:23 PM) bethlynn1: not in voip
(02:49:33 PM) bethlynn1: not in smart phones
(02:49:49 PM) bethlynn1: the only operating system space they have left is the desktop
(02:49:59 PM) bethlynn1: 2. Browser
(02:50:15 PM) bethlynn1: There are three versions that are still in use:
(02:50:20 PM) bethlynn1: IE 6, 7, 8
(02:51:00 PM) bethlynn1: Microsoft refuses to support IE6, in fact many web devs want IE6 to go away because it has not been patched for eons
(02:51:29 PM) bethlynn1: if you include IE6, Microsoft only has 52% market share
(02:51:56 PM) bethlynn1: if you exclude IE6, they don't have any where need significant market shere there
(02:52:35 PM) bethlynn1: Therefore, help your neighbor, especially if you see them using IE6 by installing firefox on their current operating system
(02:52:47 PM) bethlynn1: don't be so focused on getting them on to Linux
(02:52:55 PM) bethlynn1: because firefox is such a quick fix
(02:53:14 PM) bethlynn1: that will help us get some momentum in squashing this bug
(02:53:21 PM) bethlynn1: now Office Suites
(02:53:42 PM) bethlynn1: Microsoft Office 2007 is an unpopular product
(02:53:49 PM) bethlynn1: no one likes the ribbon
(02:54:05 PM) bethlynn1: and it introduces the .docx extension
(02:54:34 PM) bethlynn1: which unpatched legacy versions of Microsoft Office can not  open
(02:54:54 PM) bethlynn1: moreover, there are US patent concerns specific to MS Word 2007
(02:55:36 PM) bethlynn1: Microsoft will not change way MS Word operates in MS Office 2010
(02:55:49 PM) bethlynn1: they aren't getting rid of the ribbon or the .docx
(02:56:02 PM) bethlynn1: this will make their users very frustrated
(02:56:06 PM) bethlynn1: therefore
(02:56:10 PM) bethlynn1: install Open Office
(02:56:23 PM) bethlynn1: on whatever operating system they use right now
(02:56:38 PM) bethlynn1: it has a much more familiar interface
(02:56:44 PM) bethlynn1: its free
(02:56:56 PM) bethlynn1: and people can still open and edit their .doc
(02:57:09 PM) bethlynn1: and there are great strides in .docx compatibility
(02:57:21 PM) bethlynn1: I see I must wrap this up
(02:57:36 PM) bethlynn1: If you are interested in Microsoft's market share
(02:57:59 PM) bethlynn1: come join us on the conversation on http://whatwillweuse.com
(02:58:23 PM) bethlynn1: I will be on #whatwillweuse on this server for about 2 hours after this talk too for questions
(02:58:47 PM) mode (+v mdke ) by jcastro
(02:59:05 PM) jcastro: wow thanks a lot bethlynn1!
(02:59:15 PM) bethlynn1: There is a comparison to a Gandhi quote as to how we should work with Microsoft
(02:59:16 PM) jcastro: hard to believe this is your first session for openweek ever!
(02:59:23 PM) bethlynn1: 1. They ignore you
(02:59:25 PM) akgraner: awesome... bethlynn1 !!
(02:59:49 PM) bethlynn1: 2. They mock you
(02:59:54 PM) bethlynn1: 3. They fight you
(03:00:02 PM) bethlynn1: 4. You win
(03:01:01 PM) bethlynn1: but how do we get past 3? Use another Gandhi quote.... be the change you want to see in the world .... Thank you very much
