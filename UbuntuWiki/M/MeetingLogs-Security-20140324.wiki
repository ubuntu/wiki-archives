** Miscellaneous and Questions
** `< ScottK> You might want to consider promoting clamav 0.98.1 from backports to updates or security/updates.  0.97.8 is not able to use all the current virus definitions and so there's a capability/security gap there if people aren't using backports.`
** mdeslaur will followup on this
