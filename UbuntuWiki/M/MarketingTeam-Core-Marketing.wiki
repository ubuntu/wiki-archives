== Introduction ==

The Ubuntu Core Marketing Team consists of experienced marketers who work on the core infrastructure of Ubuntu marketing material. The team deals with committing resources to a central repository so that all members of the Ubuntu Community have a single resource to access the voice in which we all speak.

New volunteers who are new to Ubuntu Community Marketing Team should seek to join the Ubuntu Marketing Team (https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-marketing) first, in order to gain experience before applying to ubuntu-core-marketing.
