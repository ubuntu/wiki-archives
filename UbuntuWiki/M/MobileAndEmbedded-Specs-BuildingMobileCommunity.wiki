Mobile Track

'''Ideas'''

   Create something worth building a community around

   People should be comfortable with it, making it welcoming

   Maemo annoyed people by dropping support for the first devices (N770)

   Ask/create key users/bloggers to help create your community

   Assign someone to the task of building a community

   Give external developers an easy way to develop stuff

   Ask for/open to criticism

  Excellent docs to open development to non Linux experts

  Get involved page/Ubuntu Mobile web site like other flavors do

  Define themes so community can make and share them

  Application SDK to pull together now disparate information

  Image Creator to spit out a VMWare image/package to get eyeballs on it

  Events e.g Open Bossa

  If not host them at least participate on them heavily.

  Developer Device Program

  Central discussion/support location like Internet Tablet Talk or Garage

  Planet

  Use existing Ubuntu Community Infrastructure

  Community "Developer of the Week" with photo and writeup for outstanding contributions <- Fridge stuff? - Absolutely (Corey Burger)
