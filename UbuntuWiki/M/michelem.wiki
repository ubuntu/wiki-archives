=== Michele Marcucci ===

I'm a Debian fan since 1999 and an Ubuntu user since 2005, I'm actually (2006) working in a big italian Internet provider.

This is my personal blog (in italian): http://www.michelem.org and I like so much web 2.0 applications like:

* Flickr <nowiki>[[http://flickr.com/photos/michelem/]]</nowiki>
* Last.fm <nowiki>[[http://www.last.fm/user/michelem/]]</nowiki>
* 43 Things <nowiki>[[http://www.43things.com/person/michelem]]</nowiki>

and so on...

I'm here to help Ubuntu community because I dream every PC with a GNU/Linux inside! ;)
