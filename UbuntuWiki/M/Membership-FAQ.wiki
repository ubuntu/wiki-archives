This page contains answers to commonly asked questions about obtaining Ubuntu Membership. If you have a question that you think should be answered here, get in touch with the <nowiki>[[Membership-Boards|UMB]]</nowiki> (see footer).

==== Am I ready to apply? ====

Do you feel engaged with the project, the activities, and the people you've contributed with? Do you agree with the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/codeofconduct/2.0|Ubuntu Code of Conduct]]</nowiki> and are you interested in representing the project in your country/region? Has someone suggested that you apply? Have you contributed extensively to an important Ubuntu project/subproject/upstream and would you like to have voice in the Ubuntu Community? Do you constantly dream of an Ubuntu-powered <nowiki>[[http://xkcd.com/1046/|Skynet]]</nowiki>? If you've answered affirmatively to any of those questions, we want you!

Ubuntu Membership is not a requirement for collaboration. Non-members are encouraged to help us to bring an awesome, open, and free operating system to more human beings. You can always apply for Ubuntu Membership whenever you feel ready.

==== What happens if I don't get approved? Can I reapply? ====

Yes, absolutely! The fact that you applied in the first place indicates that you're strongly interested in formally joining the Ubuntu Community. The UMB will try its best to help you achieve this goal. Sometimes, however, the UMB agrees that your contributions haven't been enough or that you're still not engaged with the project/people involved and may reject your application. The UMB will indicate on these cases where you can improve and will suggest you reapply once you meet the requirements.

==== Can my friends and I apply at the same time? ====
Yes! However, it's important to note that applications are evaluated individually. If you and your friends have contributed in the same way (such as working together in a <nowiki>[[http://loco.ubuntu.com/|Loco Team]]</nowiki>), make sure to highlight the specific aspect where you've contributed. Showcase original content even if you use the recommended <nowiki>[[MembershipTemplate|wiki layout]]</nowiki>. Too-similar wiki pages or vague descriptions could decrease your chances of obtaining Ubuntu Membership.

==== Do I need to reapply at some point? How long will I be an Ubuntu Member? ====
While Ubuntu Membership is lifelong, every 2 years you'll need to reaffirm your membership through Launchpad. As part of the Ubuntu Community you agree with the Ubuntu Code of Conduct and we trust you to honor its principles. If you missed your reapplication deadline there is a <nowiki>[[Membership-Rejoining|process]]</nowiki> to rejoin.

==== I do not speak English or my English is weak, can I still apply? ====

Of course you can!  Simply ask someone you know who can translate for you to come to the meeting.
