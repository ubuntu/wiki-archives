== Python package testing framework ==
* autopkgtest (ian jackson) - general package testing tool
* maybe run tests after the build, not download again later
* mvo's auto upgrade tester
* upload python2.7 to a ppa and do testing
* metric gathering:
** list of problem packages
** most extensions will just need a rebuild
** 1200 binary packages with 'python' in the name
** many applications don't have 'python' in the name
** the full list would include anything that has a dependency on python
* rebuilding packages
** putting all packages in a PPA would be slow to build
** lucas' system is overkill for this number of packages [reference to system]
*** set-up takes longer than build
** wgrant - ubuntuwire.com
** regular builds feeding bugs into launchpad using a designated tag
** testing outside of LP allows better syncing with debian
   
=== Actions ===

* Review the build systems to see which is most appropriated
** ubuntuwire may be the most appropriate
** talk to wgrant
** #ubuntuwire on freenode
** determine how to integrate with mvo's upgrade tester
* Write tools to extract metric data
** extract raw data from mvo's system
** create new visualization tools
** general tools for re-use
* Best practices for package testing
** Common interface for testing python package (whether in distutils, etc)
*** Perhaps "python setup.py test" ? 
** Continuous integration system attached to cheeseshop
** Simpler version of buildbot
** Compatibility checks against various python versions
** Limited results shown on cheeseshop
** More detailed data on python.org
** Start with supported python versions and packages in Debian and Ubuntu
** Documentation defines expectations of packages to fit into the system and the best practices
** quickly integration
*** Creates templates, setup.py, etc.
*** sphinx-based templates
*** auto uploads to cheeseshop, LP, elsewhere
** paste integration
** Existing packages will need to be retrofitted
** Want to close the loop: make it easy to start a package, upload to cheeseshop etc, but also to make a system package of it via Launchpad and have that tested too.
** stdeb
*** discourage people from including debian directory
** Impediments to automatically making packages
*** Licensing issues -- may be solvable    
** Best practices:
*** Include copyright, author information, licensing, etc that can be put  into control files.
*** Feedback to developers on how to change their project to benefit from the system.
