If you have found a venue that provides a community billboard or is friendly to Ubuntu-related advertising, please log your find on this page. Only log those places at which you've successfully advertised. Each event will have its own advertising materials, so see the event page for what flyers you are to use.

=== Brick-and-Mortar Venues ===

The Ubuntu Maryland LoCo team manages its advertising using a Google map. This map keeps track of all of the locations friendly to group advertising flyers. This map may change as events are nearing, as it will be modified to reflect the current status of advertising attempts.
