 16:01:06 <jamespage> #topic Oneiric Development

 16:01:20 <Daviey> Hey.

 16:01:27 <Daviey> http://status.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/ubuntu-server/release-bugs.html

 16:01:40 <jamespage> #chair Daviey

 16:01:40 <meetingology> Current chairs: Daviey jamespage

 16:01:50 <Daviey> is looking quite good, but also not making much progress.  Not seeing too much new stuff appearing, or some of the older stuff going away

 16:02:34 <Daviey> So we really need to look at what needs to be targeted.

 16:02:34 <Daviey> We didn't get as many bug reports from beta 2 as we might have hoped.

 16:02:43 <Daviey> This could mean it's already really, really stable

 16:02:46 <Daviey> (beta 1 rather)

 16:03:09 <Daviey> So please look over bugs, and see candidates for Oneiric

 16:03:09 <Daviey> http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-oneiric/group/topic-oneiric-server-overview.html

 16:03:42 <Daviey> The main conerns i have regarding features are probably regarding arm at this stage.

 16:03:45 <hallyn> Daviey: can I mark bug 827831 wontfix?

 16:03:47 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 827831 in qemu-kvm (Ubuntu Oneiric) "[FFE] Upgrade qemu-kvm for oneiric to version 0.15 from upstream" [Low,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/827831

 16:04:01 <Daviey> It's not clear what how that is looking.

 16:04:07 <hallyn> Daviey: and can you target the qemu-kvm-spice one?

 16:04:11 <Daviey> hallyn: And take pleasure in doing so.

 16:05:00 <Daviey> hallyn: spice-gtk ?

 16:05:54 <hallyn> no, qemu-kvm-spice merge

 16:06:11 <Daviey> hallyn: bug num?

 16:06:21 <hallyn> (finding)

 16:06:29 <hallyn> 828789

 16:07:28 <Daviey> bug 828789

 16:07:29 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 828789 in qemu-kvm (Ubuntu) "[FFE] please enable spice support" [Medium,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/828789

 16:21:42 <hggdh> jamespage: hi, sorry, was on a competing call

 16:21:59 <jamespage> hggdh - np - we can backup to your topic now

 16:22:05 <jamespage> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions from the Ubuntu Community

 16:22:10 <jamespage> or even

 16:22:11 <hggdh> OK.

 16:22:16 <jamespage> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (hggdh)

 16:22:42 <hggdh> We have the new opestack tests to be integrated into the QA cycle, as jamespage told me today

 16:22:46 <hggdh> I am looking at it

 16:23:10 <hggdh> RoAkSoAx: you were to give me a writeup of installing cobbler. Is it ready?

 16:23:43 <hggdh> we want to get it set on the lab, and make it as near as possible to a standard

 16:23:55 <jamespage> #info https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ServerTeam/Oneiric/OpenStackTestPlan

 16:24:04 <adam_g> hggdh: we're still fleshing out some bugs on the provisioning side, but its coming along

 16:24:35 <adam_g> there is currently an openstack installation there

 16:24:46 <hggdh> adam_g: nice, thank you. We had some tests on cobbler, but I really want to do it by the book (whenever the book gets to exist, it will conform, I mean)

 16:25:18 <adam_g> i should note, openstack hogging almost the enitre cluster, so if someone needs to use the cluster, please let me know and ill tear down

 16:25:21 <RoAkSoAx> hggdh: orchestra/ensemble

 16:25:24 <RoAkSoAx> hggdh: it is ready

 16:25:37 <RoAkSoAx> hggdh: i mean I have already made a write-up

 16:26:18 <hggdh> RoAkSoAx: cool! We need to figure out hardware requirements, but they will not be available in time for beta. Can we do it under KVM?

 16:26:42 <RoAkSoAx> hggdh: yeah, I'm also using smoser's cobbler-devenv for that

 16:27:15 <hggdh> apart from that, life is good. Please remember beta2 is approaching (like we would forget), and test coverage *is* a requirement ;-)

 16:27:17 <hggdh> ..

 16:28:07 <jamespage> great - thanks hggdh

 16:28:17 <jamespage> #topic Open Discussion
