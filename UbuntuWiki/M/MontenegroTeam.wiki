== Ubuntu LoCo Montenegro Team (ubuntu-me) ==

Welcome to the wiki page for the Ubuntu LoCo Montenegro Team. Started in 2007,  Montenegrin Ubuntu users have been active through collaboration with regional Ubuntu and Lunux user groups. Montenegro Ubuntu users have started a Facebook group that has around 150 members. The team streamlined the efforts and focused on building a web site, forum, and wiki, which all started on 17 September 2011 on Software Freedom Day. 
 
We aim to provide free community support to users of any of the Ubuntu flavours and derivatives as well as advocating the use of free and open source software to individuals and organizations in Montenegro. 
We initiated collaboration with University of Montenegro, which resulted in University hosting the Ubuntu 11.10 Release event on 13 October 2011. The plan is to establish a long-term relationship with a synergy capable of motivating other institutions and groups to join in. 

We organized several events presenting Ubuntu GNU/Linux and other open source software. We established a good relationship with other entities in the region that support promotion of open source awareness and use. This fall we distributed 250 Ubuntu 11.10 installation disks. This efforts and momentum were crowned with official recognition as approved Ubuntu LoCo team. Please check <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu-me.org/site/vijesti/ | News page]]</nowiki> on our website to stay informed on the progress and recent activities of our LoCo team.
