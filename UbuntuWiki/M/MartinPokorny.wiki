__TOC__

I'm Martin Pokorny, and this is my homepage on the <nowiki>[[http://wiki.ubuntu.com|Ubuntu Wiki]]</nowiki>.

I have created this page because I am interested in contributing to the Ubuntu community. My interest at this time is to help deal with bugs, either by triaging them and/or fixing them. I have many years of experience working as a software engineer (primarily embedded systems and GNU/Linux applications). I do not yet have a clear preference about the areas I would like to work on, but a few that come to mind are kernel, desktop, networking and Erlang (if that's actually a category). Although I might be qualified to help fix bugs (and stand ready to help), I initially want my main effort to be bug triage to get a better understanding of Ubuntu processes.

My timezone is America/Denver (UTC -6h).

Generally, my availability will be during the (local) evening hours on weekdays.
