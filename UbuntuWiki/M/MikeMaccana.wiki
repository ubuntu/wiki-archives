Fairly new to Ubuntu. Have been working in Linux professionally for around 8 years. Am logging in to write te <nowiki>[[AppleRemoteDesktop]]</nowiki> page.

Hey not sure about your email so editing your page hope thats ok :)
Thank you so much for adding to the Herd3 release notes. And am really sorry many of the stuff didnt make it into the ubuntu.com version, working on that right now. Also would love it if you wanted to work with the marketing team in the future simply because there are some standards that we like to follow if we can like shadows under the images etc.. #ubuntu-marketing on freenode and the marketing list.
