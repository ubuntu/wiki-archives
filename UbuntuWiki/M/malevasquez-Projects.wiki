~+ One of the projects I have worked on that stands out to me the most is '''RIDE 4 A WOMAN'''. They are a non-profit organization whose mission is to empower women in Uganda by giving them the opportunity to learn different skills. I was very lucky to have the opportunity to work very closely with the organization and I even got to work with the developers and designers of the webpage. Apart from the skills I learnt by working with other people and professionals, I  am really grateful for the chance I was given and it still remains as one of the most meaningful projects I did, in my opinion. +~
