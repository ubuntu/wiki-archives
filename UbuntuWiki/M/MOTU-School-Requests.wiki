=== How to request a session ===

If there is an area of Ubuntu packaging that you would like to know more about then you can request a session
here so that it will be covered in <nowiki>[[MOTU-School]]</nowiki>. Any topic can be requested, but note that if it is just a
quick question the Q+A events may be more appropriate. MOTU School is designed to cover larger topics in more depth.

If you have a suggestion first check that it is not listed already. If there is your topic listed already then
place a '''+''' in the votes column so that we know that topic is popular. If there is a topic that is very close
to the one that you desire, then consider adding yours to the list of things to be covered in that session (and
add a vote as well).

If your session is not covered then add a line at the bottom of the first table to request it. In the first
column put your name and IRC nickname (if you don't use IRC then an email address should be used instead). The
next column is a short name for the topic you want covered; the title of the session. You can go in to more
detail in the third column if there are specific aspects you would like to ensure are covered. You can then leave
the final two columns blank.

Once a presenter is found for your session then it will be scheduled for a session in #ubuntu-classroom, keep
your eyes open for the announcement of this.

=== How to volunteer to present a session ===

These requested sessions need presenters, so if you are knowledgeable on one of the subjects listed here
please consider volunteering to present the session.

If you wish to present a session then add your name and IRC nickname (or email) to the presenters column of the
table. We will then get in touch about scheduling a slot for your session.
