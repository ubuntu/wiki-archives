==== Your Own MOTU team ====

The idea behind MOTU subteams is to
* separate the MOTU package maintenance work into subtopics for the different interests that 
** touch a set of packages in universe and 
** can be grouped to concentrate the work in a team rather than to put it on a single maintainer's shoulders. 
* be able to better
** plan transitions
** discuss needed changes
** organize work.

MOTU teams should not only be formed by universe maintainers, but also by users and testers who help pointing out packaging bugs or testing package fixes. They should have a teamleader as a single point of contact and may have several subteams. 

All teams should work together very tightly with their counterpart of the main teams found <nowiki>[[Teams|on this page]]</nowiki>. Strong contact to the according Debian maintainers is highly appreciated.
