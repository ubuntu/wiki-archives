== Mir Graphics Card Testing ==

Welcome to Mir graphics card testing!

To participate with this testing simply install Mir (either in the Ubuntu archive as outlined on http://unity.ubuntu.com/mir/installing_prebuilt_on_pc.html or with a pre-built image for your flavor (e.g. the Xubuntu testing at http://vanir.unit193.tk/mir/).

=== Mir Status as of 8 Dec 2013 ===
- no proprietary driver support (dependent on 3rd parties) (bug report? / feature request? / status of canonnical's "negotiations" with nvidia and amd?)

- “input events seeming slow/last buffer render delay”
https://bugs.launchpad.net/mir/+bug/1199450 (FIX RELEASED)

- no multimonitor support
https://bugs.launchpad.net/mir/+bug/1102760 (FIX RELEASED)

- no bypass composition support at the system compositor level, iow: framerates will be (s)low
https://bugs.launchpad.net/mir/+bug/1109963 (FIX RELEASED, except Android) 

- no power management enabled
https://bugs.launchpad.net/xmir/+bug/1193222 (FIX RELEASED, similar issue: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xorg-server/+bug/1231857)

- no VESA support (no software rendering backend)
https://bugs.launchpad.net/mir/+bug/1118903 (TRIAGED, research phase)

- XMir always listening to keyboard, passwords may appear in other X sessions
https://bugs.launchpad.net/xmir/+bug/1192843 (FIX RELEASED)

- System compositor children receive all input events 
https://bugs.launchpad.net/mir/+bug/1102757 (FIX RELEASED)

- multi session, doesn’t work (bug report? / feature request?)

=== How To Test ===

First find out which graphics card you have with:

<pre>
lspci
</pre>

Look for the line which mentions a graphics controller.

Now find out which version of Mir you have with:

<pre>
dpkg -s libmirserver1
</pre>

Note down the version number in the `Version:` line.

=== How to determine success or failure ===

Now run your system with XMir enabled and test it is running with:

<pre>
ps ax | grep "unity"
</pre>

You should see a line with `unity-system-compositor` listed. If you see this you are running Mir! If you see this and your desktop works as normal, this is considered a '''success'''.

If you have a propreitary graphics driver (e.g. many Nvidia/ATI cards) and you run the above command and don't see a `unity-system-compositor` then the system correctly fell back to X and this is considered a '''success'''.

If the system doesn't display graphics or you see a line with `unity-system-compositor` and you see significant performance or tearing issues, this is considered a '''failure'''.

'''Please note: multi-monitor support is not currently implemented - don't mark a test as a failure if multi-monitor doesn't work'''.

| Unity + CCSM working exceptionally well. No Unity Dash or Panel problems.  I am not noticing any performance decreases. Using Cube Reflection and Deformation option from ccsm gives a very lucid rendering of that effect while under xmir, moreso I would say than with X. This is an improvement upon X renderings of the same tool and/or xmir is enhancing X in some fashion. I am using Intel Sandybridge Desktop x86/MMX/SSE2

| Unity works very well on this Dell Dimension 3100. There is some regression with CCSM graphical options. It is more or less good-bye to glxgears and wobbly windows but Cube+Rotate works well. Dash and Panel very snappy as usual.

| The live session runs on Xmir. Experience normal for a development ISO image. The installed failed in the sense that the reboot did not bring a desktop running on Xmir. I did not tick Install Third Party Software. So, the Nvidia driver was not active. I checked this in Additional Drivers and Nouveau was the driver. I rebooted and now I have Xubuntu running on Xmir. It may take a second reboot to bring up Xmir. The platform is stable and applications load and run as they should. The ordinary user would not notice if it was Xserver or Xmir. So, I do not think that the issue of needing a second reboot is important. There are a couple of minor issues with Xmir which are known and have been present since Ollie Reis PPA was opened. Using that PPA I have been running Xubuntu+xmir since the beginning of July.

| Running nouveau driver on a hp Mobile Workstation 8540w. __update__: Login screen is briefly preceeded by desktop snapshot of previous session . mir_client_demos and glxgears run smoothly. AVI and DVD playback is smooth. Suspend/resume works. Window manager issue: navigation buttons sometimes fail to work. RDP client (Vinagre) through VNC works but has serious redraw issues. Slight tearing issue in Firefox when scrolling pages. Occasionally system locks up completely, cold reboot neccessary.
