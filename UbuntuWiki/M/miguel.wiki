== Main interests ==

I have been working around Gnu/Linux systems for several years. My main interests are:
* Kernel hacking
* Real-time operating systems (kernel!)
* Having fun

== Currently... ==

I've been working on RT systems development/testing for embedded systems.

I just started taking a look at the Linux kernel -rt tree and will try to help on the Ubuntu RT Team ;)
