Hi, my name is Malcolm Lalkaka (mlalkaka). I live in British Columbia, Canada. Currently, I am an undergraduate student in the School of Computing Science at <nowiki>[[http://www.sfu.ca|Simon Fraser University]]</nowiki>. 
I use Ubuntu Linux at home for everything except playing a couple of video games that are built for MS Windows and don't run well through <nowiki>[[http://www.winehq.org|Wine]]</nowiki>. I also try to help people in #ubuntu (irc.freenode.net), usually while trying to get some help of my own ;-). I've added very little to this Wiki, but hopefully that will change soon.

Wiki Pages to Which I Wish to Contribute:
* UbuntuVideoTutorials
* CreatingScreencasts
