Apr 29 20:00:33 <Iowan>	#startmeeting
Apr 29 20:00:48 <Iowan>	Clocks are going off behind me - must be time to start
Apr 29 20:00:51 <Iowan>	PRESENT
Apr 29 20:01:09 *	Chazz throws a present at Iowan
Apr 29 20:01:19 *	Iowan misses
Apr 29 20:01:32 <Chazz>	D:
Apr 29 20:01:52 *	Chazz gently tosses a present at Iowan! :p
Apr 29 20:02:22 *	Iowan ducks after the first one missed
Apr 29 20:02:42 <Iowan>	Anyone else?
Apr 29 20:03:06 <Infl8ableSoulm8>	I'm srta here.
Apr 29 20:03:11 <Infl8ableSoulm8>	with an 'o'
Apr 29 20:04:28 <Iowan>	gringochapin joined a bit ago... or the machine did...
Apr 29 20:05:45 <Iowan>	Off to the agenda, then.
Apr 29 20:05:45 <gringochapin>	I'm here. Just got distracted chatting in #hamradio
Apr 29 20:06:26 <Iowan>	I should go there sometime - it's been years since my xmitter was warm.
Apr 29 20:07:07 <Iowan>	Meeting frequency... is weekly good, or should we back off a bit?
Apr 29 20:07:27 <Chazz>	I vote we meet only when we actually have something to meet about.
Apr 29 20:07:28 <Chazz>	:P
Apr 29 20:08:14 <gringochapin>	I vote we meet monthly,, with an option to do so if we have something to talk about.  If we don't have meetings at least once a month, we risk dieing on the vine.
Apr 29 20:10:36 <Chazz>	Maybe, meet once a month minimum, but possiblity of more if we actually have something to meet about?
Apr 29 20:10:39 <Iowan>	This would be the "official, gets-reported" meeting - social hour still weekly?
Apr 29 20:10:55 <Chazz>	There's a social hour?
Apr 29 20:11:00 <Iowan>	Or does this get to be a burden, too?
Apr 29 20:11:29 <Iowan>	Last week was particularly "social" :)
Apr 29 20:11:50 <Infl8ableSoulm8>	people should hang out in irc and blab constantly.
Apr 29 20:12:17 <Infl8ableSoulm8>	I will interject off-topic ramblings from time to time to get the blabbery started if need be.
Apr 29 20:12:18 <Iowan>	Yes, but some of us are addicted to the forums...
Apr 29 20:12:46 <Chazz>	Then, there's others...
Apr 29 20:12:52 <Chazz>	Who forgot that the forums existed.
Apr 29 20:12:54 <Chazz>	:p
Apr 29 20:12:59 <Infl8ableSoulm8>	oh, well, it would take me far too long to become remotely interested in the forums.
Apr 29 20:13:15 <Infl8ableSoulm8>	are there forums specificall for here?
Apr 29 20:13:22 <Infl8ableSoulm8>	or just general ubuntu forums?
Apr 29 20:13:27 <Iowan>	There IS an Iowa forum
Apr 29 20:13:38 <Iowan>	Not much there, though
Apr 29 20:14:04 <Iowan>	Feel free to post thre...
Apr 29 20:14:10 <Iowan>	there...
Apr 29 20:14:37 <Infl8ableSoulm8>	ahh...
Apr 29 20:14:49 <Infl8ableSoulm8>	well, I rarely have anything to say about ubuntu.
Apr 29 20:14:59 <Infl8ableSoulm8>	since it rarely gives me any trouble
Apr 29 20:15:56 <Iowan>	If we reduce to monthly, which day/week is best?
Apr 29 20:16:29 <Chazz>	Either the first or the last.
Apr 29 20:18:47 <gringochapin>	Today is the last... why not keep the pattern.
Apr 29 20:19:31 <Iowan>	That would keep it away from my 3rd Thursday commitment
Apr 29 20:21:54 <Iowan>	Differing opinions?
Apr 29 20:22:57 <Iowan>	Going once...
Apr 29 20:24:56 <Iowan>	Next meeting May 27 @8:00 pm
Apr 29 20:25:55 <gringochapin>	It's on the calendar.
Apr 29 20:26:02 <Iowan>	AtomicSpark was working on the release party - Saturday, downtown somewhere
Apr 29 20:27:16 <Iowan>	I don't see any recent email additions
Apr 29 20:28:45 <Iowan>	Any other "business"?
Apr 29 20:30:03 <Iowan>	There goes the clock again - perhaps we'll call it a short meeting tonight
Apr 29 20:30:18 <Infl8ableSoulm8>	So, who's bringing the women and booze for the DM release party?
Apr 29 20:30:42 <Iowan>	Where are you bringing them and when?
Apr 29 20:31:15 <Infl8ableSoulm8>	we'll work that out quickly if we can actually come up with some women and booze, I'd imagine.
Apr 29 20:31:45 <Infl8ableSoulm8>	otherwie I doubt a DM party will happen.
Apr 29 20:32:56 <Iowan>	Maybe for Manic Mudpuppy - or whatever the next release becomes
Apr 29 20:33:53 <Iowan>	#endmeeting
