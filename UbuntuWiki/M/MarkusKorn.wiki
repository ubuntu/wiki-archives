* Markus is one of a kind. He is one of the core developers and maintainers of Zeitgeist and stands out with his keen eye for quality. Without him Zeitgeist wouldn't be where it is today. His work on optimizing Zeitgeist and delivering the best possible quality for Ubuntu should not go unrecognized. He is a quick learner and has been learning how to package to satisfy Ubuntu users who are interested in using Zeitgeist. He also goes around fixing what can be fixed in other projects, proving himself very valuable to the Ubuntu Community. This is a clear call for the Ubuntu Community to make him a Member! -- <nowiki>[[Seif Lotfy|SeifLotfy]]</nowiki>
