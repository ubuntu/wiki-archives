__TOC__

== Ubuntu 5.10 installation ==
Use a normal install, I haven't tested SATA or RAID but everything else works no problems.

== After the install ==
Everything is autodetected, I have noticed a distortion with the on-board sound. Turning down the master volume seems to fix it, or atleast reduce it greatly.
