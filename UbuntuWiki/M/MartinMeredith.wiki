=== About Me ===
Put Simply, I'm me. Most people know me as Mez, and I like it like that, I prefer my nickname to my real name.

I am involved with many aspects of Ubuntu, most notably my work with Backports and with the IRC Team.

An avid open source enthusiast, and self proclaimed geek. Currently volunteering with many open source projects, including being maintainer for symfony and xdebug in Debian & Ubuntu. Programming for me is a hobby, as well as a career, which can be seen in my Open Source Work.
