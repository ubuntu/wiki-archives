__TOC__

The McCaslin platform is Intels' current solution for ultra mobile PCs (UMPCs). 
Intel competes on this market with VIA's C7-M chip.

The platform uses an Intel Stealy processor (officially known as A110 and A100) build using a 90 nm production process.

In Q1 2008, the McCaslin platform will be replaced with the more energy efficient 'Menlow' platform, which in turn will be replaced by 'Moorestown' in 2009.
