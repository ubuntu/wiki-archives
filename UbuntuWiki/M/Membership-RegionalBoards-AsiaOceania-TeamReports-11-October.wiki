The approval results from the 11th October Asia Oceania Membership meeting are as follows:
* Ashickur Rahman (<nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ashickur-noor|ashickur-noor]]</nowiki> | <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ashickur-noor|ashickur-noor]]</nowiki>) was asked to come back in a while after being able to show more sustained and significant contributions. Discussions were had in to how he could possible join in on some other projects like translation and LoCos to assist with this development. Support was offered to achieve these goals in the near future.

It was also discussed and agreed upon to move the meetings to monthly. This was so that it lines up with the frequency of other Membership Board meetings. It was noted that if we were getting more applicants and we were unable to get through them in a normal meeting then we could re-instate the twice a month meetings if needed.
