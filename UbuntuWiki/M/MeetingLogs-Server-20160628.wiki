 16:02 <jgrimm> #topic Review ACTION points from previous meeting

 16:03 <jgrimm> not seeing anything in the 0621 minutes

 16:03 <jgrimm> #topic Yakkety Development

 16:03 <jgrimm> anyone have anything in general on Y?

 16:04 <jgrimm> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/YakketyYak/ReleaseSchedule

 16:04 <jgrimm> nacc, how goes php7 in yakkety?

 16:04 <nacc> jgrimm: excuses is pretty clean now, we're almost 100% in sync or merged, I think

 16:04 <jgrimm> \o/ great. nicely done

 16:04 <nacc> jgrimm: i'm sure there are more packages to find, as we go, but the big ones are done

 16:05 <jgrimm> cpaelzer, could you give folks an update on dpdk plans?

 16:05 <cpaelzer> sure

 16:05 <cpaelzer> so we have a few things in flight, the tl;dr is as following

 16:06 <cpaelzer> several companies joined forces on packaging dpdk as debian package

 16:06 <cpaelzer> this is under FD.io and inclused at least canonical, brocade, cisco and linaro

 16:06 <cpaelzer> we will create a package base on dpdk 16.07 for yakkety

 16:07 <cpaelzer> 16.07 will be released by dpdk in about 210 days

 16:07 <cpaelzer> 20

 16:07 <cpaelzer> sorry

 16:07 <jgrimm> heh

 16:07 <cpaelzer> openvswitch isn't ready (yet), but we expect them to be soon - which is what I'll test on then

 16:07 <cpaelzer> the other contributors will test with their respective solution

 16:07 <cpaelzer> which will make it very well tested from different points of view

 16:08 <cpaelzer> and finally thanks to jamespage we will likely soon have a git based pre oepnvswitch-2.6

 16:08 <cpaelzer> which I then will dpdk'ify

 16:08 <cpaelzer> a lot more down the road, but good for now I tihnk

 16:08 <jgrimm> cool. thanks cpaelzer

 16:08 <cpaelzer> also more and more emails about support and some questions on askubunutu

 16:09 <cpaelzer> last FYI https://wiki.fd.io/view/Deb_dpdk

 16:09 <jgrimm> thanks

 16:10 <jgrimm> FYI, docker 1.11.2 is now in Y, and sitting in X-proposed for verification ..  plan would be to update again for docker 1.12.1 upstream

 16:11 <jgrimm> anything else for Yakkety topic?

 16:20 <cpaelzer> NTP: I had several changes lined up for Debian to be picked up on the next merge, but there is not a lot of activity.

 16:20 <cpaelzer> NTP: The Debian maintainer said on my question if he waits on something from me "I guess I'm waiting for time to work on the ntp package again."

 16:21 <cpaelzer> 1567540:     On the other hand this is auto-invoked on ifup and some other things depending on setup, so a few can cause a lot of reports.

 16:23 <nacc> rbasak: both bugs are pending testing results, but fixes are available, i've gotten postivie responses to one of them already (LP: #1553563)

 16:23 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1553563 in bacula (Ubuntu) "bconsole to Bacula Director fails with authorization problem message" [Medium,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1553563

 16:23 <magicalChicken> rbasak: still unable to reproduce 1394403, have submitted patch for 1296835 and I believe you have uploaded it already. Testing fix for 1534538 atm

 16:24 <rbasak> Thanks!

 16:24 <magicalChicken> rbasak: Yeah, I can take a look at fixing the ifup script there

 16:24 <rbasak> I think that's everyone. I have quite a bit to digest!

 16:24 <rbasak> I haven't triaged bugs recently, so no new assignments, sorry. I will triage soon. If there's anything urgent, I'll assign midweek.

 16:24 <rbasak> So, I guess there's no need for everyone to hang on?

 16:24 <rbasak> Thank you for all the progress everyone - again I'm really pleased with how this effort is going.

 16:24 <nacc> would it make sense to move our bugs to a spreadsheet or osmething?

 16:24 <nacc> so it would be less of a poll every week and we can update status async?

 16:24 <rbasak> I actually have it in a spreadsheet.

 16:24 <nacc> :)

 16:24 <rbasak> I'd be happy to share it ;)

 16:24 <rharper> rbasak: thanks for driving this

 16:25 <nacc> yeah, i was just sthinking, cpaelzer's bug list flooded the channel a bit today, might be easier to follow along when my (or anyone else's) bugs show up to be polled if it was just done via the spreadsheet directly as to status, but assignment and help was done here, or so

 16:25 <rbasak> I think that makes sense.

 16:25 <rbasak> Let's try it.

 16:26 <cpaelzer> I'm ok updating there as well - that was just my local tracker file which I now wrote a script to create IRC compatible rbasak-status-reports

 16:26 <nacc> heh

 16:26 <cpaelzer> rbasak: feel free to share and I'll try updating there

 16:26 <rbasak> Hmm. And just as you've written your script, we deprecate it. Sorry :)

 16:26 <cpaelzer> I enjoyed it for a day at least

 16:26 <cpaelzer> and since it is one line ...

 16:26 <cpaelzer> long line ...

 16:27 <rharper> hehe

 16:27 <cpaelzer> I'll keep my local list in any way since I forget too much (politician mode)

 16:29 <jgrimm> rbasak, i'm assuming you are working through the responses?

 16:30 <rbasak> jgrimm: I'll do it offline I think. Since I don't have anything new to assign, might as well not hold people up. So I think I'm done for now, thanks.

 16:31 <jgrimm> rbasak, cool. thanks again

 16:31 <jgrimm> with that.. we are done.
