== Introduction ==
It is almost that time! The next version of Kubuntu 10.10, the Maverick Meerkat, is almost upon us. In preparation for the October 10th release, we are offering users the Release Candidate. This version is appropriate for testing fresh installations and upgrades. As an RC, we are encouraging people to try installing or upgrading to this test release to help us weed out any last minute issues. While it is still a pre-release, it should be quite close to what the final version will be and therfore appropriate for a wide range of users to try out in non-crtitcal environments.

There is quite a collection of updates and changes to be found for Kubuntu fans, even some cool things since the beta was released. 

Read on for some of the highlights!

-----
'''NOTE:''' ''This is the Release Candidate. Though it is a close preview of what 10.10 will be, it is still a pre-release version. As such, it's use is '''__NOT__''' encouraged for anyone needing a stable system or for anyone not comfortable running into the occasional breakage. This Release Candidate '''__IS__''' recommended for those who want to help in testing both upgrades and fresh installs, which assists us in squashing any remaining issues. Please do not use this in a production environment with data or workflows that you cannot do without.''

== Getting the Release Candidate ==
RC images can be downloaded from the following URL:
* http://releases.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/maverick/
It is always best to <nowiki>[[HowToMD5SUM|check your cd image]]</nowiki> before  you install!
The md5sums can be found <nowiki>[[http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/releases/maverick/rc/MD5SUMS|here]]</nowiki>.

'''Upgrades''' can be made from Kubuntu 10.04 LTS, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MaverickUpgrades/Kubuntu

== What's New ==

=== Combined Desktop/Netbook ISO image ===
For 10.10, Kubuntu have merged the Desktop and Netbook images into one featuring both the Plasma Desktop and Plasma Netbook workspaces. The appropriate workspace for your machine will be launched at login; you can also change the workspace in System Settings.

Plasma Desktop and Plasma Netbook workspaces

=== New default web browser - Rekonq ===

Rekonq is now the default web browser for Kubuntu.  It is built on both KDE Platform and Qt WebKit technologies and sports a modern, clean interface that maximizes space for web browsing and doesn't get in your way.  Both Konqueror and the Kubuntu Firefox Installer are still provided for users who prefer these options.

<nowiki>[[attachment:maverick-rekonq.png|<nowiki>[[File:maverick-rekonq-wee.png]]</nowiki></nowiki>]]

=== KPackageKit ===

<nowiki>[[http://dantti.wordpress.com/2010/09/29/open-the-package-get-your-application/|KPackageKit]]</nowiki> for Kubuntu now has an application-focused view. You can find individual packages by searching by name.  The backend has been changed to the much faster aptcc to ensure your installs are as quick as possible.

<nowiki>[[attachment:kpk2.png|<nowiki>[[File:kpk2-wee.png]]</nowiki></nowiki>]]

New features such as a package-list backup/restore tool and application screenshots are just a few of the enhancements KPackageKit provides to give Kubuntu users a better, polished and stable package management tool.

=== Ubiquity Installer ===
Our installer has had a few changes. On boot Ubiquity will offer you the option of running the live system or installing directly.

<nowiki>[[attachment:ubiquity1.png|<nowiki>[[File:ubiquity1-wee.png]]</nowiki></nowiki>]]

The installer now lets you download updates and restricted packages such as MP3 playback during the install so you don't have to do them later (of course you will need internet access for this).

<nowiki>[[attachment:ubiquity2.png|<nowiki>[[File:ubiquity2-wee.png]]</nowiki></nowiki>]]

The installation starts after the disk setup page, before you have completed the other setup pages, so it'll be ready to use sooner.

<nowiki>[[attachment:ubiquity3.png|<nowiki>[[File:ubiquity3-wee.png]]</nowiki></nowiki>]]

=== Global Menu by default for Plasma Netbook ===

Plasma Netbook now sports the <nowiki>[[http://agateau.wordpress.com/2010/05/10/getting-menus-out-of-application-windows/|Global Menu]]</nowiki> by default.  This innovation helps conserve vertical space on small netbook screens.  In combination with the Plasma Netbook panel no longer auto hiding by default this represents a significant improvement in Plasma Netbook usability from previous releases.

<nowiki>[[attachment:global_menu.png|<nowiki>[[File:global_menu-wee.png]]</nowiki></nowiki>]]

=== BlueDevil ===
<nowiki>[[http://www.afiestas.org/bluedevil-the-new-kde-bluetooth-stack-is-here/|BlueDevil]]</nowiki> has become the default Bluetooth programme to make file transfer and other Bluetooth operations much more reliable.

=== QApt Batch ===
<nowiki>[[http://jontheechidna.wordpress.com/2010/08/10/qapt-in-maverick/|QApt Batch]]</nowiki> now replaces install-package as the update/batch-installer utility. QApt Batch features improved security features via PolKit-1 support, improved robustness, as well as usability enhancements.

<nowiki>[[File:qapt-batch1.png]]</nowiki>

=== PulseAudio ===
Kubuntu now uses the PulseAudio sound server by default.  Building on the efforts of Ubuntu over the last several release cycles, this system is now used by Kubuntu to give users enhanced configurability, flexibility and ease of use.  System settings has been updated to enhance pulseaudio control integration.

=== Kubuntu Mobile Tech Preview ===
A new flavour for Kubuntu.  Kubuntu Mobile uses the Plasma Mobile workspace to create an operating system suitable for use on smart phones such as Nokia N900s.  Available in Tech Preview for i386 and ARM platforms.

== Known Issues ==
On login, the following error message may occur: "Unable to save bookmarks in /home/{USERNAME}/.local/share/user-places.xbel". This is incorrect, and can be safely ignored. (Bug: 627815)

On some Intel graphics chips, Desktops effects may not be enabled, and may work poorly when they are  (Bug:628930) (Bug:630580)

X may crash on KDM logout (Bug:651294)

Users cannot enable autologin (Bug:649539)

The Global Menu may not show gtk applications' menus. You will need to install the package ''appmenu-gtk''.

Rekonq does not (yet) have spellcheck capabilities
