== Who am I? ==

I've been using various flavors of Unix for 28+ years, and used Multics before that. Professionally, I work with extremely large software development projects (500+ people) as a system architect. Although I've had a machine at home running Linux for 5+ years (Red Hat), my exposure to Ubuntu began only recently, and I've been delighted with its reliability and the strength of the community behind it.

Within Ubuntu, I'm a regular user of <nowiki>[[http://gnucash.org|GnuCash]]</nowiki>. I'm looking to become a bug Triager.

=== Other activities ===

I am a variable star observer with the <nowiki>[[http://aavso.org|American Association of Variable Star Observers]]</nowiki>
