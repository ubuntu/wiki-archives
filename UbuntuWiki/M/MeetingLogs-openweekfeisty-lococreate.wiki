=== Ubuntu Open Week - Creating a LoCo Team - Rich Johnson - Sat, Apr 28, 2007 ===
TZ UTC-4
<pre>
(02:59:18 PM) nixternal: OK, How many people are here for the "Starting a LoCo" talk?
(03:02:01 PM) nixternal: well, due to it being fairly quiet, and I am on a very tight schedule, I think what I will do is just try to answer questions for those who are interested
(03:02:14 PM) nixternal: I think running the OpenWeek on Saturday & Sunday is not that great of an idea
(03:02:19 PM) awkorama: me.. a bit.. not really starting one, just want to know how one works
(03:02:33 PM) nixternal: OK, we can cover that a little bit
(03:02:47 PM) nixternal: anyone else have anything they really want to know about a LoCo or how to start one?
(03:03:20 PM) nixternal: awkorama: do you have a LoCo team in your area?
(03:03:34 PM) jenda: nixternal: I would like to hear about what happens if a LoCo doesn't work right.
(03:03:44 PM) jenda: nixternal: and how to go about solving it
(03:03:45 PM) nixternal: jenda: they blow up
(03:03:47 PM) nixternal: next question?
(03:03:49 PM) nixternal: ;)
(03:03:49 PM) jenda: haha
(03:03:52 PM) jenda: :)
(03:04:12 PM) nixternal: OK, first off, don't confuse an Ubuntu LoCo team as a LUG
(03:04:24 PM) nixternal: I think that is one thing a lot of people tend to do
(03:04:47 PM) nixternal: LUGs are all about geeking out and Linux and FOSS in general
(03:05:08 PM) nixternal: I would say that you should at least be a member of a LUG to get an idea of what you will be facing
(03:05:42 PM) nixternal: I know at first people didn't like the idea of a LoCo in Chicago, and would rather have seen us as members of their LUG and what not
(03:05:51 PM) nixternal: then again, Ubuntu wasn't so popular in Chicago last year either
(03:05:58 PM) nixternal: this year, wow what a change
(03:06:04 PM) nixternal: anyhow...
(03:06:31 PM) nixternal: To distinguish a LoCo from a LUG, the main thing you will be doing is ADVOCATING UBUNTU and UBUNTU ONLY!
(03:06:46 PM) nixternal: advocating isn't the only thing though
(03:06:55 PM) nixternal: but I think that is something future members of your team should know
(03:07:15 PM) nixternal: they will be doing more advocating than getting together to drink some beer and hack all day, that is more a LUG style
(03:07:31 PM) nixternal: of course there is nothing wrong if you and your LoCo want to do that, but don't make it your #1 priority
(03:07:48 PM) nixternal: So, the big tasks for any LoCo are:
(03:07:55 PM) nixternal:  * Advocating - duh, I just said that :)
(03:08:02 PM) nixternal:  * Support
(03:08:14 PM) nixternal:  * And if applicable, translation
(03:08:33 PM) nixternal: OK, so what makes this different than any other team/membership deal in the community
(03:09:07 PM) nixternal: Lo - the first part of LoCo is local. So where ever you are in the world, your goal and your job is do those 3 things, and then some, to your local area
(03:09:25 PM) ***nixternal is hungry!
(03:09:27 PM) nixternal: ;)
(03:09:39 PM) nixternal: OK...so from that
(03:09:53 PM) nixternal: The main reason I am supposed to be chatting today is Creating a LoCo
(03:10:13 PM) nixternal: many probably wonder why I got picked, and just to let you know, i am also wondering the same
(03:10:32 PM) nixternal: 1 year ago myself and Joey Stanford set out to create the first LoCo teams in the United States
(03:10:52 PM) nixternal: I don't know if it was luck, or it was destiny, but both of our LoCo teams blew up, in a good way
(03:11:19 PM) nixternal: Right now, Ubuntu Chicago has roughly 80 members listed on our Launchpad page, however we have hundreds in the Chicago land area alone
(03:11:23 PM) nixternal: and we are continually growing
(03:11:37 PM) nixternal: remember how I said to distinguish yourself from a LUG as a LoCo is not a LUG
(03:11:58 PM) nixternal: well now Ubuntu Chicago incorporates more LUG members throughout the area than non-LUG members
(03:12:22 PM) nixternal: so we have people with backgrounds ranging from "I just got a free CD" to "I have been hacking since 1950"
(03:12:59 PM) nixternal: and you need those people, beginners to experts. Truthfully, the beginners are your greatest aspect, as they will be able to provide info that you need in order to get people to switch
(03:13:30 PM) nixternal: I find it hard at times to try and tell people to switch because I am stuck in GNU mode, and probably always will, since that was the main reason I switched to Linux only in 1994/1995
(03:13:46 PM) nixternal: ========================
(03:13:56 PM) nixternal: that is a break because I was just rambling up there
(03:13:58 PM) nixternal: ==========================
(03:14:10 PM) nixternal: OK, lets look at what you need in order to create a LoCo team
(03:14:18 PM) nixternal: #1 - INTEREST
(03:14:37 PM) nixternal: You need people from your city, state, or country that is interested in doing everything a LoCo team does
(03:14:59 PM) nixternal: Once you have the interest, and you get a solid backing, creatin the team is a breeze
(03:15:17 PM) nixternal: If you can't obtain #1, hold off on anything else
(03:15:32 PM) nixternal: Ubuntu Chicago started in the Forums in April of 2006
(03:15:55 PM) nixternal: after about 2 days and a few pages of various people saying YES lets do this, I decided to go ahead and get the ball rolling
(03:16:03 PM) nixternal: So, what did I do next?
(03:16:18 PM) nixternal: don't laugh, this is actually how easy it really is to create a LoCo team
(03:16:33 PM) nixternal: I added Ubuntu Chicago to the list at => https://wiki.kubuntu.org/LoCoTeamList
(03:16:41 PM) nixternal: then from there I created:
(03:16:48 PM) nixternal:  * https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ChicagoTeam
(03:16:53 PM) nixternal:  * #ubuntu-chicago
(03:17:11 PM) nixternal: THAT WAS IT!
(03:17:20 PM) nixternal: We were a LoCo team, however we weren't yet official
(03:17:24 PM) nixternal: OFFICIAL?
(03:17:50 PM) nixternal: Official means that the Ubuntu Community Council has recognized the work you have done in advocating and supporting Ubuntu in your area
(03:18:07 PM) nixternal: Once we became official, we setup the Mailing List and the Web Site
(03:18:15 PM) nixternal: and recently a spot on Ubuntu Forums
(03:18:40 PM) nixternal: So really, in order to create a LoCo team, you just need interest from more than yourself in your area
(03:18:43 PM) nixternal: or locality rather
(03:18:55 PM) nixternal: from there, it is as easy as I made it sound
(03:19:07 PM) nixternal: you know what the most difficult part of creating LoCo teams are?
(03:19:13 PM) nixternal: Getting a mailing list!
(03:19:46 PM) nixternal: OK, question time, I rambled enough to confuse even me :)
(03:20:12 PM) nixternal: I know jenda wants to know what to do when a LoCo team has issues.
(03:20:18 PM) nixternal: WAKE UP EVERYONE!
(03:20:32 PM) awkorama: what advocacy success do u achieved?
(03:20:32 PM) janjimusptfajar: :)
(03:20:37 PM) ***Belutz awakes
(03:20:39 PM) nixternal: hahaha
(03:20:51 PM) MikeDK: still alive:-P
(03:20:54 PM) ***txwikinger is awake
(03:20:59 PM) ***emonkey-f to
(03:20:59 PM) nixternal: awkorama: we have actually had a ton of advocacy success
(03:21:12 PM) chuckf: So when starting a group, how much do you have to 'do' to get approved status?
(03:21:26 PM) nixternal: We have performed a few install fests, handed out thousands of CDs, pamphlets, and whatever else you can think of
(03:22:14 PM) jenda: nixternal: I'm here ;)
(03:22:15 PM) nixternal: chuckf: About 2 months of solid work with the LoCo team, document everything you have done, i.e., install fests, local FOSS events, sitting out front of a local shopping mall throwing CDs at people
(03:22:26 PM) nixternal: chuckf: now that isn't set in stone either
(03:22:26 PM) jrib: what kind of locations did you hand out CDs at?
(03:22:30 PM) jenda: nixternal: there have been questions in #ubuntu-classroom-chat
(03:22:36 PM) nixternal: jrib: any location I could legally go.
(03:22:52 PM) chuckf: How do you get quantities of nice looking cd's without being approved?
(03:22:55 PM) nixternal: jenda: tell them to bring them in here, I can't hit ctrl+n, to much work ;)
(03:23:21 PM) nixternal: chuckf: you go through ShipIt, but you try and order 50 CDs, then member 2 does the same and so on
(03:23:47 PM) nixternal: truthfully, I don't think it is fair for official teams to get them as easily, and not for teams starting up
(03:24:03 PM) MikeDK: agree
(03:24:05 PM) chuckf:  When another distro, ie IPCOP, works for an aspect of a project can we promote that?
(03:24:06 PM) jenda: nixternal: it's how the openweek works!
(03:24:07 PM) nixternal: I think for teams starting up they shold have the same access, it is those CDs that could help create a great foundation for the team
(03:24:13 PM) jenda: nixternal: you shouldda got a secretary ;)
(03:24:20 PM) jenda: nixternal: and no, I'm not available ;)
(03:24:38 PM) nixternal: bah
(03:25:00 PM) nixternal: chuckf: as long as your main objective is Ubuntu, throw whatever else you want to in there
(03:25:14 PM) nixternal: chuckf: for instance, I am KDE through and through, for 10 years now
(03:25:23 PM) nixternal: don't think that I go to an event and push nothing but Ubuntu
(03:25:45 PM) nixternal: Ubuntu and the partner projects (Kubuntu, Xubuntu, and Edubuntu) are my #1 pushers for an OS
(03:26:01 PM) nixternal: then there is KDE and so on
(03:26:27 PM) chuckf: well IPCop I don't thin is a derivitive. However for desktop/servers its all K/X/ed/Ubuntu that I push
(03:26:56 PM) nixternal: ya, another thing to, I really think the success of Ubuntu Chicago lies within all of the great people involved
(03:27:06 PM) nixternal: we all get along with each other, we hang out, have a great time
(03:27:18 PM) nixternal: and while we are doing that, we are pimping Ubuntu with a smile
(03:27:31 PM) nixternal: Chicago has had great success
(03:27:31 PM) txwikinger: nixternal: QUESTION: what should be the granuality for LoCos... i.e. one LoCo per country (or State) or should there be a finer granuality like cities?
(03:27:36 PM) nixternal: thanks txwikinger
(03:28:05 PM) nixternal: txwikinger: great question, my response to that is not the favorite, but obviously the most logical in many circumstances
(03:28:14 PM) nixternal: If you are in the US, then States
(03:28:33 PM) nixternal: country LoCo's are fine, however how can something like China, India and such have 1 LoCo
(03:28:36 PM) nixternal: impossible
(03:28:47 PM) nixternal: so I think location, location, location is big
(03:28:55 PM) nixternal: Ubuntu Chicago is city, some people think I was wrong for doing that
(03:28:56 PM) jenda: nixternal: India has states too
(03:29:05 PM) jenda: nixternal: (not sure about china)
(03:29:05 PM) nixternal: jenda: yes, and each one should have a LoCo
(03:29:14 PM) nixternal: there are some who will not agree with that
(03:29:15 PM) jenda: nixternal: and they do (except, not all do yet)
(03:29:27 PM) nixternal: people don't agree with Ubuntu Chicago because it is a City, why now Ubuntu Illinois
(03:29:50 PM) nixternal: Chicago consists of an area covering 4 states with roughly 9+ million citizens
(03:30:00 PM) nixternal: it was definitely needed
(03:30:15 PM) nixternal: I couldn't expect people from southern Illinois to run Chicago
(03:30:32 PM) nixternal: we have a couple hundred volunteers, and we all find ourselves stretched thin at times
(03:30:56 PM) nixternal: so you really have to play it by ear, if you are in or around a big city, then I feel a city LoCo is needed
(03:31:47 PM) nixternal: Ubuntu California for instance, some of you may know how huge of a state that is
(03:31:57 PM) nixternal: then you have 2 of the largest cities in the world w/in the state
(03:32:01 PM) nixternal: ready Belutz
(03:32:14 PM) nixternal: you can't expect 1 team to cover so much, impossible
(03:32:19 PM) Belutz: <chuckf> QUESTION: How can unapproved teams get resources such as Fiesty CDs when needed for projects (install fests, interested libraries, etc)
(03:32:21 PM) nixternal: play it by ear, that is your best choice
(03:32:57 PM) nixternal: chuckf: I responded up a little bit, but...What we used to do is I would try and get 50 to 100 CDs, custom order via shipit
(03:33:12 PM) Belutz: <samgee> QUESTION: Should LoCos be putting their efforts into converting people from other distros?
(03:33:13 PM) nixternal: I would fill out the info like "there is a huge event coming, we would like to do an Ubuntu gig"
(03:33:24 PM) chuckf: nix, that was an old question pasted in
(03:33:24 PM) nixternal: now get each one of your members to do the same thing
(03:33:32 PM) nixternal: if you put 100, you will might get 50 though
(03:33:37 PM) nixternal: ya, just wanted to touch up on it
(03:33:44 PM) nixternal: samgee: No.
(03:33:54 PM) nixternal: reason...
(03:34:08 PM) nixternal: people who are already with a distro typically have their mind made up
(03:34:24 PM) nixternal: I know last year 90% of Chicago was BSD and Slackware
(03:34:28 PM) nixternal: 1% was Ubuntu
(03:34:30 PM) jenda: ...and besides, people already using linux will probably choose ubuntu on their own eventually ;)
(03:34:34 PM) ***jenda runs
(03:34:38 PM) nixternal: Now, I am willing to bet more than 50% is Ubuntu
(03:34:52 PM) nixternal: not because we targeted them
(03:35:04 PM) nixternal: but because they seen how our community was and how we kicked arse
(03:35:22 PM) Belutz: <samgee> QUESTION: What are some of the amazing things LoCos have achieved?
(03:35:28 PM) nixternal: so no need to target them, they will eventually realise that their distro community stinks and want the coolness Ubuntu has :)
(03:35:43 PM) nixternal: samgee: man you have the tough questions
(03:35:44 PM) Belutz: (oops, too fast)
(03:35:49 PM) nixternal: perfect timing
(03:36:07 PM) nixternal: There has been so many achievements!
(03:36:27 PM) nixternal: amazing, I would say everyone of them. If you were able to bring 1 person over to Ubuntu, to me that is amazing.
(03:36:33 PM) nixternal: it isn't an easy feat to accomplish
(03:36:59 PM) nixternal: I think a lot of the FOSS events around the world have been manned by a LoCo team or 2, and everything we have heard was great
(03:37:22 PM) nixternal: now, if you mean amazing like "delivered a baby while encrypting their file system" well then I don't know of one of them stories ;)
(03:37:49 PM) nixternal: I think all work done by VOLUNTEERS FOR FREE, that is amazing to me
(03:38:08 PM) nixternal: to get people to see and understand our freedoms and our joys, that is amazing
(03:38:21 PM) nixternal: and we do this becuase of Ubuntu
(03:38:35 PM) purpleleave: QUESTION: How many hours did you spend per day normally when running your Chicago Ubuntu?
(03:38:44 PM) nixternal: wow
(03:39:08 PM) nixternal: purpleleave: the first month, I was spending upwards of 20 hours a week on Ubuntu Chicago
(03:39:20 PM) nixternal: but see then we didn't have the resources there are today
(03:39:42 PM) nixternal: I know I wanted to make it rock hardcore, so I actually treated it like one of my businesses
(03:40:01 PM) nixternal: you will definitely put in time if you are creating a LoCo
(03:40:08 PM) nixternal: but it is all rewarding in the end
(03:40:18 PM) nixternal: oh
(03:40:20 PM) nixternal: one more thing
(03:40:30 PM) nixternal: don't think that after you have it started the time will lessen
(03:40:32 PM) isti: hy is that the ubuntu open week chat ?
(03:40:36 PM) nixternal: I have actually gotten busier
(03:40:39 PM) nixternal: isti: yes
(03:40:47 PM) Belutz: <chuckf> QUESTION: How do you explain to your significant other that your 'Ubuntu luggy thing' is important? :)
(03:40:50 PM) isti: oh thx
(03:40:57 PM) nixternal: I have been asked to do many speaking engagements, I am up to 1 or 2 a week now
(03:41:13 PM) nixternal: chuckf: I ctrl+alt+deleted her years ago
(03:41:23 PM) nixternal: although, somehow she does understand
(03:41:34 PM) nixternal: Ubuntu is my significant other!
(03:41:42 PM) nixternal: muhahah!
(03:42:05 PM) jenda: nixternal: you're scaring me.
(03:42:17 PM) nixternal: shush
(03:42:21 PM) nixternal: ok, jenda question tiem
(03:42:28 PM) nixternal: what to do when the LoCo goes boom!
(03:42:54 PM) nixternal: first thing first, you should probably see it occurring, hopefully in enough time to interject
(03:43:17 PM) nixternal: disagreements are going to be had, not only in the Ubuntu community, but within any community where there is creativity
(03:43:55 PM) Belutz: <samgee> QUESTION: Does Acapulco have its own LoCo and is the magic down there so strong? :)
(03:44:36 PM) nixternal: I have no clue, but when they do, make sure you invite me!
(03:44:45 PM) nixternal: Next year I will hopefully be living in Cabo San Lucas
(03:44:52 PM) nixternal: OK, back to jenda really quick
(03:45:01 PM) jenda: yay
(03:45:02 PM) nixternal: when the disagreements start and you can't find a resolution
(03:45:39 PM) nixternal: I would first take it up with Jono and if it is bigger, then you might have to take it to the Community Council
(03:46:11 PM) nixternal: jenda: is that what you were looking for?
(03:46:26 PM) jenda: maybe ;)
(03:46:27 PM) nixternal: remember we have a Community Council that can help you take care of everything civilly
(03:46:31 PM) nixternal: wow I just made that word up
(03:46:41 PM) jenda: I was just asking to see if you had something to say about it :)
(03:46:43 PM) nixternal: IRSSI needs spell checkin'
(03:46:48 PM) nixternal: jenda: thanks!
(03:46:50 PM) jenda: Our loco is working just fine ;)
(03:46:51 PM) chuckf: and spelled it right
(03:46:52 PM) jenda: hehe
(03:46:55 PM) kunstar left the room.
(03:47:00 PM) nixternal: woohoo
(03:47:04 PM) nixternal: anymore questions?
(03:47:10 PM) ***nixternal has church to get to
(03:47:15 PM) nixternal: OH!!!
(03:47:20 PM) jenda: nixternal: get outta here, then ;)
(03:47:37 PM) ***nixternal is Rich Johnson, man with many hats, feel free to email me at nixternal@ubuntu.com with any questions you have about anything really
(03:47:41 PM) chuckf: how do you edge a lawn with Ubuntu?
(03:47:44 PM) Belutz: :)
(03:47:57 PM) nixternal: chuckf: carefully, under 1500RPM
(03:48:06 PM) jenda: chuckf: get yourself some old breezy shipit CDs and lay them along the edge...
(03:48:09 PM) lotusleaf: nixternal: do you leave ubuntu cds in the hymnals? :)
(03:48:09 PM) BHSPitMonkey: The question is, how do you edge a lawn -without- ubuntu
(03:48:15 PM) nixternal: lotusleaf: yup
(03:48:20 PM) lotusleaf: ha ;)
(03:48:22 PM) nixternal: I will be taking about 25 with me
(03:48:25 PM) jenda: BHSPitMonkey: I love you :)
(03:48:29 PM) chuckf: Thanks Richard
(03:48:29 PM) BHSPitMonkey: you could scissor some sharp teeth into an ubuntu cd and stick it on your edgy
(03:48:37 PM) nixternal: believe it or not, my Church has helped push Ubuntu big time as well
(03:48:38 PM) BHSPitMonkey: edger*
(03:48:39 PM) BHSPitMonkey: :O
(03:48:44 PM) lotusleaf: nixternal: righteous
(03:49:06 PM) BHSPitMonkey: nixternal, have they seen Satanic Edition? :O
(03:49:12 PM) nixternal: OK, rock on! Thanks everyone, and if you have any questions, don't hesitate to message me here on IRC or email me
(03:49:28 PM) Belutz: nixternal, thanks for a refreshing session :)
(03:49:28 PM) nixternal: BHSPitMonkey: I used the SE wallpaper for a while cuz I really liked it
(03:49:42 PM) ***nixternal is actually an Ichthux dev, so we use that :)
(03:49:51 PM) nixternal: thanks Belutz for the help!
(03:49:59 PM) ***nixternal runs!!!#@#>>>>>
(03:50:02 PM) Belutz: nixternal, anytime
(03:50:05 PM) janjimusptfajar: thanks nix :)
