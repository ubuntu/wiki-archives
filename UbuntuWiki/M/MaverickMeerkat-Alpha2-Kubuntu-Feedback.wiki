* At first glance, I liked it a lot. KDE 4.5RC is very stable, and in a few minutes testing from a USB memory, I could test quickly the spiral windows tiling, rekonq (tought I remember it crashed on me, but not sure why), and kaddressbook has again all editing fields. I'll write back when I have more time to test. Daniel Velasco <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:yoalieh]]</nowiki> 
* Now with 4.5RC2 this is a great release, very slick and usable. <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:blackpaw]]</nowiki>
