=== Using PPAs for just specific application versions ===
for technical reasons we don't have per-version daily repositories as this would cause problems when shipping partial transitions such as moving the firefox meta package from 3.5 to 3.6 package

For users that want to run dailies or backports for just a specific version, we suggest lowering the priority of the repository using apt pinning and then increasing the score for the app that is wanted.

To opt-in only for specific application versions we provide a wizard script puts the proper pinning in place.

==== Example (use dailies for firefox-3.6 only) ====

 1. lower priority for ppa, create a file <code>/etc/apt/preferences.d/firefox-daily-opt-in</code> with: <pre>
Package: *
Pin: release o=LP-PPA-firefox-daliy
Pin-Priority: 10
</pre>

 1. raise priority for firefox-3.6 packages, create a file <code>/etc/apt/preferences.d/firefox-36-daily-enable.pin</code>: <pre>
Package: firefox-3.6* abrowser-3.6* xulrunner-1.9.2*
Pin: release o=LP-PPA-firefox-daliy
Pin-Priority: 510

Package: firefox abrowser
Pin: release o=LP-PPA-firefox-daliy version 3.6*
Pin-Priority: 510
</pre>

version 5.8*
