=== About Nemerle ===

{{{
Nemerle is a high-level statically-typed programming language for the .NET (see also Mono) platform. It offers functional, object-oriented and imperative features. It has a simple C#-like syntax and a powerful meta-programming system.

It was developed at the Wroclaw University (Poland) by Kamil Skalski, Michał Moskal, Prof. Leszek Pacholski and Paweł Olszta. It has been named after the mage Nemmerle from "A Wizard of Earthsea" by Ursula K. Le Guin (spelling with a single m is a design decision).}}}
