== Main inclusion report for gnome-power ==

=== Requirements ===

1. ''Availability:'' http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/g/gnome-power, compiled on all arches.

2. ''Rationale:'' The package is a valuable addition to the desktop, it offers a easy to use gui interface for the powermanagement in gnome. It is part of the <nowiki>[[http://udu.wiki.ubuntu.com/PowerManagementConfiguration|powermanagement spec]]</nowiki>, worked out at udu

3. ''Security:''
* No CANs.
* No Secunia record.
* No binaries running as root, the privileged backend is provided by `powermanagement-interface`.

4. ''QA:''
* Installation: gnome-power-manager should be added to the default session in laptop mode, gnome-power-preferences settles in the desktop preferences.
    ThomMay asks: why not added globally, since it can handle keyboards, UPSes and mice?
* Bugs: no Debian/upstream showstopper bugs.
* Deals with batteries of laptops, keyboards, UPSs and wireless mice.
* The package is actively maintained upstream.

5. ''Standards compliance:''
* Standard `debhelper` packaging.
