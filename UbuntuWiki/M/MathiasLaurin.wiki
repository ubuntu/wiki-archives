__TOC__

=== Mathias Laurin ===

I have had a small experience on Sun and SGIs. I installed Gentoo on my Acer laptop after getting bored with XP (fast) and I recently bought a Vaio UMPC running Ubuntu and a MacBookPro still running Mac OS X.

I can script and program and use computers for both fun and work.
