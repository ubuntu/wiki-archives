20:05:44 <bfallik>	Killeroid: i'll ask your questions when we're talking about it
20:06:01 <leftyfb>	http://www.prleap.com/pr/94897/
20:06:14 <bfallik>	but my guess is - we don't know how many people exactly
20:07:23 <Killeroid>	bfallik: ok, thanks, i am going stick around and so any big news, just post in the channel
20:07:36 <bfallik>	Killeroid: ok
20:08:10 <bfallik>	for advertising, we're going to canvas local universities - MIT, Brandeis, etc.
20:08:32 <Killeroid>	mhm
20:27:21 <bfallik>	http://boston.craigslist.org/gbs/cps/434046763.html
20:46:06 <maccam94>	what about contacting the globe?
20:46:19 <maccam94>	or other newspapers
20:46:55 <maccam94>	are we having any guest speakers at the event?
20:47:00 <maccam94>	anyone from the OLPC project?
20:48:21 <bfallik>	i don't believe anyone has contacted hte globe
20:48:27 <bfallik>	or any other newspapers
20:48:44 <bfallik>	We believe some OLPC guys will be joining us
20:49:07 <bfallik>	And rumor has it Mako is delivering a presentation on ????
20:50:21 <Killeroid>	if we could get one of the OLPC to make a presentation, that would  make the whole installfest more newsworthy for the newspapers
20:52:02 <bfallik>	no one from OLPC wants to do an OLPC presentation
20:53:07 <bfallik>	but leftyfb enquired into it
20:53:44 <Killeroid>	who is Mako and what is he delivering a presentation on?
20:54:19 <bfallik>	Mako:  http://mako.cc/
20:54:20 <maccam94>	mako is an important linux guy, i think he (used to be?) is an ubuntu developer
20:54:25 <bfallik>	he wants to speak on Ubuntu
20:54:31 <maccam94>	he also does stuff for debian
20:54:35 <maccam94>	goes to MIT methinks
20:54:44 <Killeroid>	ok
20:55:22 <maccam94>	an interview about the state of linux + info about the installfest could be a neat thing to go in next week's science + technology section
20:55:50 <bfallik>	gutsy release party at The Globe: http://boston.citysearch.com/profile/4730129/boston_ma/globe_bar_cafe.html

20:57:02 <bfallik>	yup
20:57:15 <bfallik>	7pm on the day of the release
20:57:20 <BillN1VUX>	                                         Economical but not customer oriented.                                                      08/08/2007 Posted by jess0987

20:58:23 <maccam94>	been there before
20:59:01 <maccam94>	and it has free wifi ;)
21:00:02 <maccam94>	it's just a bit small, it would be cool if we could reserve the place
21:00:23 <maccam94>	(this is if people don't really want to do the globe restaurant)
21:01:27 <bfallik>	i think we've agreed on The Globe
21:01:39 <bfallik>	maybe MoS for Gutsy+1
