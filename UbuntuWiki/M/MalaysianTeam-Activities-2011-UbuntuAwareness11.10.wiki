Ubuntu 11.10 Awareness Campaign is a project by <nowiki>[[ApOgEE]]</nowiki> for Ubuntu Malaysia LoCo Team. The idea behind this project is to increase public awareness about Ubuntu brand and to let them have question in mind about 'What is Ubuntu?'. Therefore, before October 2011, ApOgEE have designed Ubuntu Oneiric Ocelot t-shirt to be spread across the country and to be wear on 15th Oct 2011. The reason to wear this t-shirt is to make it seen by people and let them ask question about ubuntu, getting information about where and how to get ubuntu.
