__TOC__

Currently, takes almost one week to upload a kernel.

One of the problems we had during the Hardy cycle was that changes to the kernel either from the mainline side or from the mobile side broke things for the other team.  A second problem is that in the mobile area we get changes that need to be applied immediately and we can't wait for the normal kernel cycle for updates.  To solve these issues it was suggested breaking out the single kernel tree into two trees, main line and mobile (and this might even split further as needed). 

Kernel team is going to set up an Intrepid tree for mobile, MSG will take over this responsibility to maintain and build.  It may or may not be folded back in mainline kernel later.  This will be determined by haw far it's dirverged from the mainline kernel at the time.

* Pat signed off on MSG taking over Intrepid forward.  They are doing this anyway and the increase in work is minamal at best.  UME team will assist getting the packages up into main (UME has MOTU and coredev's on staff currently).
