=== Requirements ===

1. ''Availability:'' http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/libx/libxml-libxml-common-perl/, compiled on all arches.

2. ''Rationale:'' Dependency of `libxml-libxml-perl` which was requested to go into main.

3. ''Security:''
* No CANs.
* No Secunia record.
* Implemented in C and is very likely used in web servers, so bugs have the potential of privilege escalation.

* Bugs: No Debian bugs.
* No special hardware interaction.

5. ''Standards compliance:''
* Standard `debhelper` packaging.
* FHS met.
