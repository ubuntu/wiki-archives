== Introduction ==

Kubuntu will release version 10.10, the Maverick Meerkat, in October 2010.
With this, the second Alpha pre-release, we are introducing some new and interesting things in preparation for the next official version of Kubuntu. Read below for some of the highlights.
For more information of what is planned and being worked on, please read the document available on the link.
<nowiki>[[https://wiki.kubuntu.org/Kubuntu/Todo | this page]]</nowiki>.

'''NOTE:''' ''This is an alpha (pre-) release. Pre-release versions of Maverick are '''__NOT__''' encouraged for anyone needing a stable system or for anyone who is not comfortable running into occasional, even frequent, breakage. Pre-release versions '''__ARE__''' recommended for Kubuntu developers and those who want to help in testing, reporting, and fixing bugs.' Please do not use this in a production environment with data  or workflows that you cannot do without.''

== Getting Alpha 2 ==
Alpha releases can be downloaded from the following URL:

With SC 4.5 rc1, we have a solid look at what the next version of KDE's innovative Plasma Desktop and Netbook will become.

=== Combined Desktop/Netbook ISO image ===

For Maverick, Kubuntu have merged the Desktop and Netbook images into one. Ubiquity, Kubuntu's installer, will detect the screen size before the install and use either the Plasma Desktop workplace or the Plasma Netbook workplace as needed.

Users will be able to switch between the two in System Settings, as well.

=== Rekonq as Default Browser ===

The Webkit-based <nowiki>[[http://rekonq.sourceforge.net|Rekonq]]</nowiki> 0.5 Beta2 will be on the Favorites Menu as the main browser for Kubuntu, though the system default is still Konqueror. This gives users a chance to give it a spin and help root out any bugs before version 0.5 Final is released.
