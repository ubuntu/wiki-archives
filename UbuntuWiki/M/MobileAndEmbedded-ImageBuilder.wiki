__TOC__

=== New image builder (livecd-rootfs based) ===

==== Status ====
* Initial work progressing, first cut does occasionally boot from USB key - unfortunately not reliably
* Needs a new installer, we don't want to use install.sh / install.cfg
** Proposal to run as a regular UME app from the live session (just like ubiquity)
** Perhaps we can port ubiquity or debian-installer?

==== Requirements ====
* Need to support multiple use cases (end users, system builders, distributors, testers, etc.)
* Need to allow customisation of installation chroots to support downstream modification
* Is ideally based on seeds for package contents management
* Configuration times:
** Image Build
** Image Install?
** First Boot
* Need input from IS and MSG to ensure requirements are complete

==== Milestones ====
* Boots from USB on target devices
* Supports installation on target devices
* Supports first-boot time customisations
** OEM installation mode?
* Supports image-build time customisations
