== Welcome ==

=== Introduction ===
Welcome the Ubuntu Mobile Edition customer information wiki. We hope this brief synopsis of our process and procedure will help you to more efficiently work with Canonical to produce high quality open source software. If you have any questions or comments about the information contained on this page, please contact you Canonical representative.

Thank you,<<BR>>
Ubuntu Mobile Edition Team

== Using Launchpad ==
Launchpad is the development process, code repository, and defect tracking system for all Canonical projects and software. Launchpad is a large and complicated system, so the goal of this section is to provide you with an overview of how that system works, and some tip and tricks for successfully navigating the site.

=== Basics ===
Launchpad has several areas of focus:
* Code - Make all your project's code accessible, wherever it's hosted on the internet. 
* Bugs - Track and solve bugs, whether they occur upstream, downstream or directly in your code. 
* Blueprints - Develop, implement and track the progress of your software's features. 
* Translations - Cut the time it takes to translate your software.
* Answers - Build a community support team and turn their answers into a searchable knowledge-base. 

Since most of you interaction with Launchpad as a Canonical customer will be through the Bugs interface, we will start with that.

=== Bugs ===
There is a defined path new bugs travel on their way to being fixed and validated in released software. It is our goal to make this process as simple as possible. 

These are the status levels a bug can attain, and brief definitions. For more detailed information, please see our public wiki https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bugs/Status

* '''New''': Bugs are submitted with this status
* '''Incomplete''': If you have to ask the reporter questions, set the bug to. Incomplete bugs expire from active status after a defined period of time.
* '''Invalid''': This status should be used when the bug report does not affect the project is is assigned to, or does not contain enough information to evaluate and the owner has not responded to incomplete.
* '''Confirmed''': Someone believes that that the report describes a genuine bug in enough detail that a developer could start working on a fix
* '''Triaged''': A member of [UbuntuBugControl], or project developer believes that the report describes a genuine bug in enough detail that a developer could start working on a fix.
* '''In Progress''': If '''you''' are working on fixing a bug, set it to <code>In Progress</code> so people know what's going on
* '''Fix Committed''': The changes are pending and to be uploaded to the project repository.
* '''Fix Released''': A fix was uploaded to an official Ubuntu repository. QA has confirmed the fix is present in the release code and the reported bug can no longer be reproduced.
* '''Won't Fix''': This status is sometimes used when the bug fix is too controversial. It is most often used for bugs with a release target that will not be fixed in that particular release but may be fixed later
