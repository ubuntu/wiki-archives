__TOC__

== Main inclusion report for libxml-libxml-perl ==

=== Requirements ===

1. ''Availability:'' http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/libx/libxml-libxml-perl/, compiled on all arches.

2. ''Rationale:'' Dependency of `gtk-sharp2-gapi` which was requested to go into main.

3. ''Security:''
* No CANs.
* No Secunia record.
* Implemented in C and is very likely used in web servers, so bugs have the potential of privilege escalation.

4. ''QA:''
* Installation: Library, no end user tool.
* Bugs: Some Debian bugs, no showstoppers.
* No special hardware interaction.

5. ''Standards compliance:''
* Standard `debhelper` packaging.
* FHS met.
* Debian package and library policy met.
