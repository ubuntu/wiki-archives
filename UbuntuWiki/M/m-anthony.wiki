=== Other Usual Stuff ===

I work as an Information Security Analyst in Washington DC for the federal government. I have been dealing with computers in one form or another since the early 80's. In 2006 I installed my first Linux distro, Ubuntu 5.10 Breezy Badger. I loved it, and had a wonderful time learning the ins and outs. Unfortunately my laptop died of a massive hardware failure caused from a minor fall off a three story building. 
The replacement system was taken much better care of, but I left XP on it for far too long. I have recently reloaded the system with Ubuntu 10.10 Maverick Meerkat.
