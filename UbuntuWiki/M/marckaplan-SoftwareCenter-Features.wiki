__TOC__

=== Features planned for the next version ===

==== Deauthorizing your computer ====

<nowiki>[[File:previous-purchases-menu.jpg]]</nowiki>

So that you can be honest about using keeping purchased software only on your own computers, the “File” menu should contain a “Deauthorize Computer…” item. This item should be sensitive only when you are already signed in or when any USC purchases are installed.

<nowiki>[[File:deauthorize-simple.jpg]]</nowiki> <nowiki>[[File:deauthorize-list.jpg]]</nowiki>

Activating the item should open a confirmation alert, which lists installed purchases only if there are any. Choosing “Deauthorize” should queue any purchased items for removal, and clear your Ubuntu SSO credentials from the computer.

=== Features you can implement ===

These are mini-specifications for new features and other changes that anyone is welcome to implement for the Ubuntu Software Center. Some are more important than others; some are more difficult than others. If you would like to implement any of them, please do so <nowiki>[[https://code.launchpad.net/software-center|in a branch]]</nowiki> and propose it for merging. Thanks! (Once a feature is implemented, the mini-specification here will similarly be merged into the main specification.)

==== Launching from multiple standalone .deb packages ====

(bug Bug:694838)

If you select multiple .deb packages in a file manager, and open them with Ubuntu Software Center, it should display a <nowiki>[[#custom-list|custom list]]</nowiki> for the packages.

==== Larger screenshot thumbnails ====

(bug Bug:673214)

To be as large as practical without scrolling, the size of the gallery area for showing screenshots on a <nowiki>[[#software-item-screen|software item screen]]</nowiki> should be whichever of these is smallest:
* half the width of the main pane, and tall enough to show whichever screenshot or movie has the greatest height-to-width aspect ratio scaled to that width;
* the height of the main pane, and wide enough to show whichever screenshot or movie has the greatest width-to-height aspect ratio scaled to that height;
* the width of the widest screenshot or movie, and tall enough to show that screenshot or movie at full size;
* the height of the tallest screenshot or movie, and wide enough to show that screenshot or movie at full size.

==== Being encouraged to submit a review ====

<nowiki>[[File:review-encourage.png]]</nowiki>

If you have installed an application, and used it at least three times in the past week, the end of the home screen should have a “Give Your Feedback” box with text of the form: “You’ve used {title} a lot recently. Would you like to __review it__?”. The link should begin the review process for that application.

''Can we vary the “a lot” wording sensibly?''

==== Comparing and syncing installed software between computers ====

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <tablestyle="float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;" style="border:none;"><nowiki>[[File:menu-file.png]]</nowiki>
|}

The “File” menu should contain a “Sync Between Computers…” item. If syncing is not already set up, choosing it should:
# Navigate to the “Installed” section, if USC is not there already.
# If you are not signed in to Ubuntu SSO, open an SSO sign-on dialog with primary text “With multiple Ubuntu computers, you can publish their inventories online to compare the software installed on each.” and secondary text “No-one else will be able to see what you have installed.”
# Permanently reveal a sidebar in the “Installed” screen, and focus it. This sidebar should remain visible whenever you view the “Installed” section subsequently.
# Begin publishing the name and source, for each package installed on this computer, to the OneConf server.

<nowiki>[[File:installed-sync-computers.png]]</nowiki>

If syncing is already set up, choosing “Sync Between Computers…” should just navigate to the “Installed” screen and focus its sidebar.

The sidebar should list all computers registered with this account, starting with “This Computer ({hostname})”, then a space, then any others sorted <nowiki>[[#def-alphabetically|alphabetically]]</nowiki>. Whenever there are no others, the remaining space in the sidebar should instead contain horizontally and vertically centered text: ‘To sync with another computer, choose “Sync Between Computers” from that computer.’ Exactly one computer in the sidebar should be selected at any time.

Whenever “This Computer” is selected in the sidebar, the rest of the main pane should contain <nowiki>[[#installed|the usual contents of the main pane for a single computer]]</nowiki>.

Whenever any other computer is selected, and that computer has not yet finished pushing its list of software to the Ubuntu One account, the rest of the main pane should contain horizontally and vertically centered text: ‘“{name}” hasn’t finished publishing its inventory yet. Try again in a few minutes.’

Whenever the other computer ''has'' finished pushing its list of software, the rest of the main pane should consist of a software list view with three branches:
# ‘{number} items on “{name of other computer}” not on this computer’, with an “Install All” button at the trailing end, and each item inside having “More Info” and “Install” buttons when selected;
# ‘{number} items on this computer not on “{name of other computer}”’, with a “Remove All” button at the trailing end, and each item inside having “More Info” and “Remove” buttons when selected;
# ‘{number} items on both computers”, with no button at the trailing end, and each item inside having only a “More Info” button when selected.

The “Install All” and “Remove All” buttons should be the same width.

As with the normal list view, only one branch — or software item inside that branch — should be selected at any time, and whenever an item is selected it should expand to reveal a “More Info” button. In addition, a selected item inside the that-computer-but-not-this-one branch should have an “Install” button at the trailing end, and a selected item inside the this-computer-but-not-that-one branch should have a “Remove” button at the trailing end.

<nowiki>[[File:installed-sync-computers-stop.png]]</nowiki>

The menubutton at the bottom of the sidebar should contain one item, ‘Stop Syncing “{name of this computer}”’. Choosing it should permanently restore the “Installed” screen to <nowiki>[[#installed|its single-computer mode]]</nowiki>, and stop publishing this computer’s inventory to the server.

==== “Updates” section ====

===== Minimal implementation =====

<nowiki>[[File:updates.png]]</nowiki>

Whenever the Backports channel contains a version of any item that is newer than the version you have installed (or fewer than five seconds have passed since that stopped being true), an “Updates” item should appear last in the navigation bar (except for the “Progress” item, when present).

The “Updates” section should begin with a panel giving the number of updates at the leading side, and an “Update All” button on the trailing side. Each individual item should consist of its icon, title, and the new version number on the leading side, and an “Update” button on the trailing side.

Whenever an item is selected, Enter should activate its “Update” button. Whenever an update is installed or waiting to be installed, its “Update” button should be insensitive.

'''Test case:''' Install an application for which Backports has a newer version. As soon as its installation finishes, “Updates” should appear in the navigation bar.

===== Enhancement: Navigation bar emblem =====

<nowiki>[[File:updates-badge.png]]</nowiki>

In the navigation bar, the icon for the “Updates” item should have a badge containing the number of updates.

===== Enhancement: Launcher item emblem =====

In the Unity launcher, the icon for Ubuntu Software Center should have a badge containing the number of updates, regardless of whether USC is running.

===== Enhancement: Install Ubuntu updates together with application updates =====

<nowiki>[[File:updates-ubuntu.png]]</nowiki>

The panel atop the “Updates” screen should contain an “Also install Ubuntu updates” checkbox. Whenever Ubuntu updates are not available, the checkbox should be both insensitive (because changing it has no effect) and unchecked (because no Ubuntu updates will be installed when you update anything else). Whenever Ubuntu updates ''are'' available, the checkbox should be sensitive, and default to whichever checked/unchecked state it was in last time it was sensitive (checked by default).

'''Test case:''' (replaces previous test case) Install Ubuntu without installing updates. Install an application for which Backports has a newer version; as soon as its installation finishes, “Updates” should appear in the navigation bar. Navigate to the “Updates” screen; the “Also install Ubuntu updates” checkbox should be sensitive and checked. Use Update Manager to install all updates; as soon as they finish, the “Also install Ubuntu updates” checkbox should become insensitive and unchecked.

If you choose “Update All”, ''or'' “Update” for any individual item while the checkbox is checked, installation of Ubuntu updates should be queued ahead of whichever update or updates you chose with that action.

===== Enhancement: “Hide” function for updates =====

In the “Updates” screen, each individual update should have a “Hide” button on the leading side of its “Update” button. The “View” menu should have a corresponding “Hide This Update” item that is insensitive except when you are in the “Updates” section and an update is selected. Activating this command should remove the update from the list indefinitely.

Below “Hide This Update” in the “View” menu should be a “Show Previously Hidden Updates” item, which is sensitive whenever there are any, regardless of which screen you happen to be in. Selecting the item should navigate to the “Updates” screen if you are not there already, and indefinitely un-hide all updates.

===== Enhancement: Updates to other NotAutomatic channels =====

The “Updates” screen should show updates for not just Backports, but any `NotAutomatic` channel, for example “For Purchase”.

==== Smarter ellipsis of software list view items ====

In a <nowiki>[[#software-list-view|software list view]]</nowiki>, if the secondary text is wider than the space available, it should be ellipsized in the middle, not the trailing end (because unique parts of package names are often at the trailing end).

==== Copying software list view items to the clipboard ====

Whenever an item in a <nowiki>[[#software-list-view|software list view]]</nowiki> is selected, “Edit” > “Copy” should be sensitive. Choosing it should copy to the clipboard the item’s <nowiki>[[#software-title|title]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[#software-summary|summary]]</nowiki> as plain text separated by one line break. If the item has a custom icon, it should also be copied as both a bitmap and as a vector image if available.

==== Pausing or cancelling all queued tasks ====

<nowiki>[[File:progress.png]]</nowiki>

At the bottom of the “Progress” section should be an action bar, with text of the form “2 items remaining” or “All items completed” (as appropriate) at the leading end, and “Pause” and “Cancel All” buttons at the trailing end. When “Pause” is clicked, it should change to “Resume”, the “Progress” navigation bar element should change to “Paused”, and all tasks (except for the current one, if it is no longer pauseable), even any you add ''after'' you clicked “Pause”, should be greyed out except for their cancel buttons. (bug Bug:584687)

Once that’s implemented: The list of paused tasks should persist even if you close and reopen USC or restart the computer.

Finally: Whenever the computer is not connected to the Internet, USC should go into Paused mode automatically.

==== More informative text for waiting tasks ====

(bug Bug:444330)

When you request to install an item and it is waiting for other tasks in <nowiki>[[#in-progress|the “In Progress” queue]]</nowiki>, its status text should be “Waiting to install”.

When you request to remove an item and it is waiting for other tasks in <nowiki>[[#in-progress|the “In Progress” queue]]</nowiki>, its status text should be “Waiting to remove”.

==== Downloading while waiting to install ====

(bug Bug:438870)

When an item to be installed is waiting for other tasks, but the package is not yet downloaded, it should start downloading immediately. ''Or maybe when fewer than 3-ish items are already downloading?''

==== Reordering queued tasks ====

(bug Bug:465531)

For any task in the “Progress” screen that has not yet begun (or that, if <nowiki>[[#bug-438870|parallel downloading]]</nowiki> has been implemented, has started downloading but not yet installing), mousing over the list item should produce a grabbing-hand cursor. If you drag the row up or down, the rows for other unstarted tasks should scoot out of the way to show where the dragged row would end up if dropped. As a keyboard equivalent, Ctrl Up and Ctrl Down should, when possible, make the selected task swap places with the previous or next task respectively.

==== Consistent progress bar for installations and removals ====

Regardless of whether you are installing a free item, installing a for-purchase item, or removing an item, the progress bar in the <nowiki>[[#software-item-screen-state-installed|installation state bar]]</nowiki> should appear at exactly the same moment: immediately after USC knows that you are authenticated for the action.

==== Copying a Web link for an “In Progress” package ====

Whenever an item is selected in <nowiki>[[#in-progress|the “In Progress” section]]</nowiki>, “Edit” > “Copy Web Link” should be sensitive. Choosing it should <nowiki>[[#web-link-package|copy a Web link for the selected package]]</nowiki>.

==== “Where Is It?” button ====

In the screen for a graphical application in the “Installed Software” section, there should be a “Where Is It?” button. Clicking the button should:
# over two seconds, draw a ring around the interface element (''e.g.'' the Ubuntu button, or the “Applications” menu) in which the application resides
# wait for you to activate it
# instantly remove the previous ring
# over two seconds, draw a ring around the application, or around the submenu or section that contains the application
# wait for you to select the item or open the submenu
# instantly remove the previous ring, ''etc''.

At any time, focusing another window or pressing any key should cancel the process and make any ring disappear.

==== “Reinstall” command ====

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <tablestyle="float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;"><nowiki>[[File:menu-file.png]]</nowiki>
|}

In the “File” menu, immediately following the “Install” item should be a “Reinstall” item. This item should be sensitive whenever you have selected or navigated to an installed software item.

Activating the command should reinstall the item (equivalent to `apt-get reinstall`). The progress feedback should be the same as for <nowiki>[[#installing|installation]]</nowiki>, using the same Policy``Kit privilege, but with “Reinstalling…” as the text in the installation state bar.

The help should include a page on the “Reinstall” command.

==== “Remove Including Settings” command ====

http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/idea/24963/

In the “File” menu, immediately following the “Remove” item should be a “Remove Including Settings” item. This item should be sensitive whenever you have selected or navigated to an installed software item.

Activating the command should remove the package, its settings (equivalent to `apt-get purge`), and any cached package data. The progress feedback should be the same as for <nowiki>[[#removing|removal]]</nowiki>, using the same Policy``Kit privilege, but with “Removing package and settings…” as the text in the installation state bar.

The help should include a page on the “Remove Including Settings” command.

==== Residual files ====

In the “File” menu, immediately following the “Remove Including Settings” item should be a “Show Residual Files” item. This item should always be sensitive.

<nowiki>[[File:residual-settings.png]]</nowiki>

Activating the command should be the only way (other than subsequently using Back and Forward) of navigating to an “Installed Software” > “Residual Files” screen. This screen should be a <nowiki>[[#software-list-view|software list view]]</nowiki> of all packages that have been removed from your computer but that have either left behind configuration files, or that have the package still cached (bug Bug:684495). It should be different from a normal software list view in that:
* At the trailing end of each row should be the size of the settings and cached package files, ''e.g.'' “11 KB”.
* The secondary text for each item should be the date on which the package was uninstalled.
* When an item is selected, at its trailing end should be a button labelled “Delete Files”, and the “File” > “Remove Including Settings” menu item should temporarily also become “Delete Files”.

Activating the “Delete Files” command should remove the package’s settings and/or the cached package. The progress feedback should be the same as for <nowiki>[[#removing|removal]]</nowiki>, using the same Policy``Kit privilege, but with “Deleting residual files…” as the text in the installation state bar.

At the bottom of of the main pane should be an action bar containing a “Delete All” button, aligned with the “Delete Files” button for the selected item. Activating the “Delete All” button should remove residual settings for all packages displayed.

The help page on the “Remove Including Settings” command should be expanded to cover the “Show Residual Files” command too.

==== History enhancements ====

<nowiki>[[File:history.2.jpg]]</nowiki>

History rows should have the same layout and behavior as rows in a <nowiki>[[#software-list-view-categorized|categorized software list view]]</nowiki>, except that:

* They should use a text-sized icon instead of a double-sized one (because the icon is less important here, and the history is likely to be long).

* They should use the software’s <nowiki>[[#software-short-name|short name]]</nowiki> rather than its <nowiki>[[#software-title|title]]</nowiki>.

* For purchases, the short name should be followed by the price paid at that time, in the insensitive text color.

* At the trailing end of the first line should be the time at which the action occurred, again in the insensitive text color. In the “All Changes” screen only, the time should be preceded by the type of action: “purchased”, “installed”, “reinstalled”, “updated”, “removed”, or “purged”. For example, a removal that happened at 4:52 PM should appear in “All Changes” as “removed 4:52 PM”, but in “Removals” just as “4:52 PM”.

* Choosing “More Info” should navigate to the item’s screen in either “All Software” or “Installed Software”, depending on whether the item is currently installed.

* If the row is for any action that would leave the item installed (such as an installation or an update), but the item is not currently installed, the text “(since removed)” should be at the trailing end of the second line in the insensitive text color. Conversely, if the row is for any action that would leave the item uninstalled (such as a removal or a purge), but the item ''is'' currently installed, the text “(since reinstalled)” should be at the trailing end of the second line in the insensitive text color.

''To do: Work out a sensible way for the “Reinstall Previous Purchases” screen to coexist with the “Purchases” history.''

==== Animation of the main pane ====

Whenever you navigate from within a category screen to a software item screen, over 0.5 seconds, the icon of that package that was visible in the category screen should simultaneously zoom and move linearly to become the icon of the software item visible in the software item screen. At the same time, the rest of the contents of the category screen should linearly crossfade into the rest of the contents of the software item screen. Both of these effects should also happen when navigating the reverse direction, from the package screen back to the category screen.

==== Wine integration ====

<nowiki>[[File:installed-software-wine.png]]</nowiki>

If there are any installed Windows applications that are automatically removable by Wine, the <nowiki>[[#channels|installed software sources]]</nowiki> list should include a “Windows Software” child item. This should be the last item except for “Other”, and should use the generic Windows icon (the same used in Ubuntu Light).

Selecting this item should display a “Windows Software” screen in the main pane, listing those Wine applications. At the bottom of of the main pane should be an action bar containing a “Remove All” button, aligned with the “Remove” button for the selected item.

These removable Windows applications should also show up when browsing or searching the top-level “Installed Software” list.

''Do Windows applications have a title and a summary, or just a title?''

''For implementation details, see NattyWineSoftwareCenter.''

==== Support and problem reporting for ISV software ====

<nowiki>[[File:software-item-screen-web-links.png]]</nowiki>

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <tablestyle="float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;" style="border:none;"><nowiki>[[File:software-item-report-problem.png]]</nowiki>
|}

For any software item in “For Purchase” or “Independent”, its software item screen should include a “Report a Problem” link alongside the “Developer Web Site” link.

Activating this link should open a “Report a Problem” dialog with the icon and name of the application. It should ask you to “Please identify the type of problem:”, with radio buttons for the options: “Payment doesn’t work”, “Download doesn’t complete”, “Installation doesn’t work”, “Software installs but doesn’t run properly”, “Inappropriate/offensive” (only once <nowiki>[[https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/foundations-software-maturity-ratings|maturity ratings are implemented]]</nowiki>), “Legal issue”, and “Other” (the default).

Regardless of reason, if you choose “Continue”, USC should open a Web browser to a URL with the package name and reason as query parameters. That URL should then redirect to the developer support site, or the Canonical Support form, depending on the reason.

==== Invitation for new software developers ====

(bug Bug:722366)

The second item in the “Help” menu should be “For Software Developers”. It should open the default Web browser to http://developer.ubuntu.com/.

=== Yet-to-be-specified features ===

* codec search
* font search [``<nowiki>[[http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/idea/15333/|idea 15333]]</nowiki>``]
* scope control for search (All / Name / Description / Package Codename / Alternatives)
* icon view as an alternative to list view
* Melatie runs an accounting business that is far too small to have its own IT manager. She has a support contract for the Ubuntu software on the office PCs, and she knows that this doesn’t cover all the available software, so she wants to keep track of exactly what software is installed that isn’t covered.
* Ladina works as a developer at a molecular biology lab where she is not a sysadmin. She is having a bit of trouble with Biopython, and wants an easy way of seeing which version of `python-biopython` is installed and where its files are.
* Installing paid add-ons for free software (for example, filters for Inkscape)

==== Popularity ====

==== Recommendations ====

Specification in progress: <nowiki>[[SoftwareCenter-Recommendations]]</nowiki>.

==== Dragging installed applications from USC to a launcher ====

==== Finding system requirements for software ====

==== Launching via inserting an Ubuntu CD ====

The Center needs to be able to tell whether a CD containing packages is:
* for a previous version of Ubuntu
* for the same version of Ubuntu
* for a future version of Ubuntu
* for a different OS altogether.

==== Launching via file of unknown type ====

The Center needs to be able to display applications that handle a particular filetype, ''i.e.'' an equivalent to `gnome-app-install --mime-type text/html`. (Maybe distinguish between file viewers and editors?)

Nautilus then needs to be able to launch the Center to this search.

==== Subcategories ====

* <nowiki>[[http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2009/02/msg00942.html|debtags for package categorization]]</nowiki>
* http://www.enricozini.org/2007/debtags/package-managers.html
* http://debtags.alioth.debian.org/ssearch.html

==== License information ====

* http://wiki.debian.org/Proposals/CopyrightFormat

==== Developer tools ====

* For a particular package, show which packages are required for development or debugging of that package.
* Maybe treat `-dev` packages specially?

==== Eliminating the “{title} can’t be installed at the moment” alert ====

Instead of an impossible installation causing an alert saying “Sorry, {title}” can’t be installed at the moment. Try again in a day or two.”, the task should show its error status inline in the “In Progress” section somehow, and sit there across Center launches until you retry it or cancel it. The “In Progress” arrows would need to stop spinning for cases like this, because nothing is actually happening.

==== Others ====

* make clear which packages are currently subject to CVE vulnerabilities
* ensure double-clicking on a downloade .deb or .rpm gives an explanation that every user can understand. Perhaps also show an apt: -link as a suggestion for the better way of installing said package? 
* <nowiki>[[http://www.linuxfoundation.org/en/OpenPrinting/Database/DriverPackages|OpenPrinting]]</nowiki>: “To make installing printer drivers not provided by the Linux distributions easier for users, and to make providing printer drivers easier for the printer manufacturers, we have introduced a new concept of distribution-independent printer driver packages.”
* While installing, the window should be reducible (or perhaps reduce by default) to show only install progress.
* Make installation asyncronous (background process) and allow user to continue browsing the Software Center meanwhile
* Replace the “These items must be removed as well” alert with a box embedded in the package screen when you click “Remove”?
* “Also a ''permalink'' on the description page, would be pretty nice. You want to suggest a package to someone? You just have to copy paste the (apt url) application link into your IM or blog post.” [``<nowiki>[[http://www.stefanoforenza.com/ubuntu-appstore-in-the-workings/|Stefano Forenza]]</nowiki>``]
* DONE: <nowiki>[[http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/idea/19653/|idea 19653]]</nowiki>: “Most users switching over from Windows associate "Add/Remove" only with removing software, and believe that new software needs to be purchased at a retailer ...”   -- Covered by renaming from "Add/Remove" to "Ubuntu Software Center".

* If the user does not have admin rights then the program would offer to queue the program for the system admin. This is very useful when the user can just say check your install queue instead of remembering the exact packages that he needed. Especially when he is just clicking a link on the internet. Could also be useful for parents.

* Multi-level undo.
* Updates are aggregated by source package, with packages hidden inside an expander.
* Recommendations and suggestions are shown as children of an item in the list (recommendations selected by default, suggestions not).

* ''Incorporate PackageMaintainednessPresentation, including its “Future work”''

* Add a “Date Installed” column to the “Installed Software” section.
* Handle the “Extends” field for packages.
* Provide an easy mechanism for applications such as Inkscape to select and install plug-ins.
* When search field becomes non-empty, switch to results view immediately, perhaps with spinner until first results arrive. [Stuart Langridge]
* Need to define the exact behavior when waiting for other package managers to quit.
* Provide an optional "Donate" button for projects that need donations to keep going. The button could open up the donate page on their website. Or if non-free (as in beer) software is sold through the software store then the money could go through the site ... (The need was talked about in <nowiki>[[http://twit.tv/floss86|FLOSS Weekly 86 - Ardour]]</nowiki>). <nowiki>[[http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/idea/21212|Donate button in Software Store in Ubuntu Brainstorm]]</nowiki>.
** Alternatively provide a way of a project displaying a web page instead of the package description. This allows the project to collect revenue via adverts, subscription or donation. It puts the handling of revenue into the hands of the project. If the web page data isn't available then it could revert by default back to the package description. This could also be a preference option.
* Drag installed applications to `gnome-panel` or other launchers.
* Saved searches (with an emblem if they contain new stuff since you last looked at them)
* Add `apt:` URL syntaxes for:
** category pages
** search results.
* Prioritize reviews from your contacts. [Matt Griffin]
* Accessible names for other items that have no explicit label.
* How can we integrate cross-platform add-on repositories, e.g. <nowiki>[[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/|Firefox add-ons]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[http://pkg-ruby-extras.alioth.debian.org/rubygems.html|Ruby Gems]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[http://www.cpan.org/|CPAN]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[http://ctan.org/|CTAN]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[http://cran.r-project.org/|CRAN]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[http://cean.process-one.net/|CEAN]]</nowiki>?
* Log searches so that we can tweak metadata to suit them. [Randy Linnell]
* <nowiki>[[http://blog.ubuntu-tweak.com/2010/07/24/ubuntu-tweak-0-5-5-released-with-purge-ppa.html|Purge PPAs]]</nowiki> (''i.e.'' offer to downgrade to the non-PPA versions of packages).
