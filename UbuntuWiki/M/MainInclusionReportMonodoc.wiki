== Main inclusion report for monodoc ==

=== Requirements ===
# ''Availability:'' The package is available in ubuntu universe (Arch: all)
# ''Rationale:'' The package is required for monodevelop, and is a generally key part of the Mono stack
# ''Security:''
** No security issues reported
** monodoc-http starts a server and opens a port, this should stay in universe.
 0. ''Quality assurance:''
** The package contains documentation, a doc viewer, and docs in web-ready format.  Requires no configuration.
** Mono Project is upstream, has large mindshare and corporate backing. Well supported.
** No major Debian bugs.
 0. ''Standards compliance:''
** The package meets the FHS and Debian Policy.
 0. ''Dependencies:''
** Depends on gtk-sharp (1), mono already in main. Also mono-xsp. I need to update xsp in Debian before I am thrilled about putting it into main, its gotten a bit stale.

=== Reviewers ===

MartinPitt: postponed until Brandon is satisfied with the package

BrandonHale: Martin tells me we can move monodoc source to main and demote monodoc-http to universe. This would resolve both our issues.
