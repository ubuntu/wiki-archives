In Order to get the best Multimedia Experience, we want to do extensive testing with players and Codecs we want to have supported. Please help us updating the following table with your results.

If you find a combination of player/codec, which is not working, please file a bug in malone and place a link to the bugreport, so that we can track the problem.

==== Sample Media ====

In order to test these Codecs, we need free samples. Eventually, we can ship these sample data in dapper. If you happen to find free sample suitable for testing, please add links in this section.
