* Description:  An open-source game engine based on Bungie Studio's "Marathon" games.
* Notes: There is not yet any GPL, GFDL, LGPL, or CC content for this engine.  The Bungee Marathon code can be distributed freely, but it is copyrighted to Bungee and not released under one of these licenses.  This means this is not a good candidate.
