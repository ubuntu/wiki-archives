 16:06:21 <utlemming> [TOPIC] Review ACTION points from previous meeting

 16:07:10 <AlanBell> hmm

 16:07:24 <AlanBell> utlemming: I think the space before [topic] might be the issue there

 16:07:35 <utlemming> yeah....

 16:07:48 <utlemming> #meetingtopic Review ACTION points from previous meeting

 16:07:59 <Daviey> Spamaps couldn't be here. hggdh should hopefully be here later, lets carry it to later in the meeting

 16:08:04 <utlemming> lol...

 16:09:12 <utlemming> [TOPIC] Review ACTION points from previous meeting

 16:09:13 * hggdh gets in meeting now

 16:09:44 <utlemming> okay, so from the previous meeting, it doesn't look like there is any follow up

 16:09:56 <utlemming> does anyone have anything from it?

 16:09:57 <Daviey> hggdh: ah, can you comment?

 16:11:26 <hggdh> I have not seen it yet -- was pretty much out for the beginning of last week, and then we have beta 2

 16:11:31 <Daviey> utlemming: perhaps hggdh is having net troubles, lets come back.

 16:11:40 <smoser> reload the page, utlemming

 16:11:53 <smoser> there was a action item there (that i updated like 32 seconds ago)

 16:12:06 <utlemming> ah, thank you kindly smoser

 16:12:10 <hggdh> I will look at it this afternoon -- seems to be not difficult to set up

 16:12:13 <utlemming> the prior action was hggdh and SpamapS to discuss SRU verification work for bug 750371 at next meeting or before

 16:12:16 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 750371 in squid (Ubuntu Maverick) "squid causing /var to stay busy during shutdown" [High,Fix committed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/750371

 16:12:27 <Daviey> utlemming should have known that.

 16:12:32 <Daviey> hggdh: okay, can you sync up with Clint soon?

 16:12:39 <hggdh> Daviey: yes, will do

 16:13:01 <Daviey> super!

 16:13:02 <Daviey> utlemming: next?

 16:13:23 <utlemming> #topic Oneiric Development

 16:13:34 <utlemming> Daviey: how is Oneiric moving along?

 16:13:59 <Daviey> Dandy!

 16:14:08 <Daviey> We don't have that many knowns still to deal with

 16:14:14 <Daviey> I would like to run through them

 16:14:29 <Daviey> bug 655533, needs someone to work on it

 16:14:30 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 655533 in likewise-open (Ubuntu Oneiric) "[master] package likewise-open 5.4.0.42111-2ubuntu2 failed to install/upgrade: subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 1" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/655533

 16:14:50 <Daviey> install likewise-open on natty, and do an upgrade test to oneiric

 16:14:50 <Daviey> any volunteers?

 16:15:48 <utlemming> I took an initial look at it, but was unable to replicate it.

 16:15:50 <Daviey> nobody?

 16:16:01 <jamespage> Daviey: lemme take a look at it

 16:16:04 <Daviey> Okay, i'll take that to..

 16:16:13 <Daviey> ok, great jamespage to the rescue!

 16:16:27 <utlemming> #action jamespage to look at bug 655533

 16:16:27 * meetingology jamespage to look at bug 655533

 16:16:28 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 655533 in likewise-open (Ubuntu Oneiric) "[master] package likewise-open 5.4.0.42111-2ubuntu2 failed to install/upgrade: subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 1" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/655533

 16:16:30 <Daviey> bug 801494, is blocked on the udev bug

 16:16:30 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 801494 in Ubuntu "Multi part LVM layout: system fails to boot due to missing volumes" [High,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/801494

 16:16:34 <Daviey> we think it might be the same issue

 16:16:48 <Daviey> We could try adam_g's or hallyn's hack fix.. to prove it

 16:17:13 <hallyn> mine is not for the more general udev bug, only for vgchange hangs during boot

 16:17:22 <Daviey> ah

 16:17:26 <hallyn> i've not been able to deduce a cause for the udev hang

 16:17:33 <hallyn> that one has no lvm portion to it

 16:17:44 <smoser> i've reproduce bug 833783 with an additional 'udevadm settle'.

 16:17:45 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 833783 in udev (Ubuntu Oneiric) "boot failure: can't open /root/dev/console: no such file" [High,Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/833783

 16:17:48 <hallyn> and it's heisenbug from hell

 16:17:58 <Daviey> jamespage: would you be able to sync with adam to try to reproduce it with a sleep()?

 16:18:06 <smoser> basically, we *know* that the fix suggested only reduces the window for error.

 16:18:25 <jamespage> Daviey: yep

 16:18:32 <hallyn> right i'm not happy with papering over

 16:18:35 <smoser> adam_g, verified that 'udevadm --exit' drops events.

 16:18:48 <Daviey> smoser: Yep, but if we can prove it's the same issue - we are happy.

 16:18:53 <hallyn> can we get some jhunt help this week?

 16:19:09 <Daviey> hallyn: he is looking at it today

 16:19:13 <hallyn> awesome!

 16:19:15 <jamespage> \o/

 16:19:16 <Daviey> I have raised it as a prioritty issue.

 16:19:31 <smoser> Daviey, just to clarify, you're suggesting that adding 'sleep X' in a race condition would "prove" something :)

 16:19:50 <Daviey> smoser: I'm suggesting that it proves it to be the same bug.

 16:20:01 <smoser> i dont think so.

 16:20:08 <Daviey> smoser: Do you disagree that is the best action?

 16:20:30 <smoser> i dont knwo what it would buy us

 16:20:32 <smoser> seriously.

 16:20:40 <smoser> it would mean that we know that timing changes things

 16:20:42 <smoser> which we know

 16:20:48 <rbasak> and as we speak I just hit it again :-/

 16:21:11 <jamespage> OK - I have a system I can reproduce that but 100% of the time on - lemme catchup with adam_g and jhunt to see what the best way forwards is

 16:21:16 <smoser> i'm not *just* being a jerk.

 16:21:18 <smoser> i'm serious

 16:21:28 <Daviey> smoser: Okay.. i disagree.. if we can work around it in a development enviroment, to prove it is the same issue, we can mark it as a dupe.

 16:21:41 <Daviey> Then we can move on, and verify once jhunt has done his magic.

 16:22:09 <Daviey> smoser: Rather than saying we are doing it wrong, suggestions for an action are more constructive.

 16:22:24 <Daviey> It seems cheap to reproduce it with the sleep hack.

 16:22:25 <hallyn> Daviey: it's not smoser's fault there isn't a better answer for now :)

 16:22:28 <smoser> i'm suggesting you save time.

 16:22:39 <hallyn> Daviey: I think for now we keep them non-duped, and hope that the fix for one fixes the other

 16:22:43 <Daviey> smoser: seriosuly, how long does it take to test the sleep?

 16:22:46 <smoser> and not spend time trying to get more information that would lead you to the same amount of un-knowledge.

 16:22:59 <smoser> but, sure, try 'sleep 3'.

 16:23:00 <hallyn> Daviey: I'm more worried about erroneously marking something as a dup.  that usually turns out bad

 16:23:05 <smoser> cause 3 is a magic number.

 16:23:14 <hallyn> i.e., there might be a fix for bug 1, but someone testing for bug 2 says "that's not a good fix"

 16:23:15 <Ursinha> hallyn, +1

 16:23:15 <Daviey> we've probably wasted more time arguing the toss about this, than we would have JFDI'ing it.

 16:23:17 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1 in Ubuntu "Microsoft has a majority market share" [Critical,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1

 16:23:18 <ubottu> Error: Launchpad bug 2 could not be found

 16:23:22 <smoser> i'll stop now.

 16:23:40 <hallyn> Daviey: it's not about waste of time testing.  I think you should not mark it a dup based on that test.

 16:23:49 <hallyn> putting in a comment with the result, though, is helpful.

 16:23:55 <Daviey> hallyn: Which is why i suggested we check it when the udev fix lands, but at least i can mentally consider it a dupe - and start worrying less about it.

 16:24:04 <hallyn> Daviey: sounds good :)

 16:24:32 <utlemming> let's table the current discussion and move on

 16:24:34 <Daviey> moving on..

 16:24:38 <utlemming> #action Daviey, smoser, hallyn to follow up on bug 801494

 16:24:38 * meetingology Daviey, smoser, hallyn to follow up on bug 801494

 16:24:39 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 801494 in Ubuntu "Multi part LVM layout: system fails to boot due to missing volumes" [High,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/801494

 16:24:47 <Daviey> bug 827496, ikonia has offered to try and resolve

 16:24:48 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 827496 in cobbler (Ubuntu) "cobbler kickstart metadata dont affect ubuntu preseed " [High,Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/827496

 16:25:10 <Daviey> and i believe bug 831121.. He might want a hand, so listen out to cries for help.

 16:25:11 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 831121 in dovecot-antispam (Ubuntu Oneiric) "dovecot-antispam version 1.4~rc3-1 failed to build in oneiric" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/831121

 16:25:40 <Daviey> bug 832507, rbasak - have you been able to prepare a trunk patch?

 16:25:42 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 832507 in nova (Ubuntu) "console.log grows indefinitely" [High,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/832507

 16:26:03 <rbasak> Yes, I have one that I think works

 16:26:39 <rbasak> jdstrand has the libvirt fix ready now. I still need to see the whole system working for myself and test the edge cases

 16:26:40 <Daviey> rbasak: Are you likely going to be able to push a merge proposal to upstream trunk by EoD?

 16:27:19 <rbasak> No, the patch isn't ready for upstream

 16:27:23 <smoser> rbasak, can you point us at your current branch ?

 16:27:40 <Daviey> smoser: he's created a PPA based on the staged upload

 16:27:48 <Daviey> which we should be able to test in the lab.

 16:28:02 <Daviey> (with libvirt disabled, or jdstrands patch)

 16:28:05 <rbasak> I found a bug in the PPA, I made an error during one of my many rebases

 16:28:07 <smoser> branch ?

 16:28:23 <rbasak> The latest branch I have is git, against nova's git upstream. I can push that to github if you'd like to see it?

 16:28:40 <smoser> yeah, please. i'm just curious.

 16:29:00 <hallyn> fwiw I'm still trying to figure out bug 842845 - something's funky in the nova->libvirt bindings i think.  the container is running, nova doesn't know about it.

 16:29:01 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 842845 in libvirt (Ubuntu Oneiric) "problems starting multiple lxc instances concurrently" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/842845

 16:29:14 <Daviey> hallyn: that was the next bug on my hit list

 16:29:15 <Daviey> :)

 16:29:40 <Daviey> hallyn: Is it still viable for a fix in Oneiric release?

 16:30:04 <hallyn> Daviey: I think so.  It seems like it should be a simple misunderstanding somewhere

 16:30:32 <hallyn> but i need time to figure out how nova is getting and interpreting log data from the container startup

 16:30:35 <Daviey> hallyn: Great.. do keep the bug updated with status. :)

 16:30:41 <hallyn> when i get some i will :)

 16:30:57 <Daviey> hallyn: If you want some help, do shout.

 16:30:57 <Daviey> moving on..

 16:31:02 <hallyn> thx

 16:31:04 <Daviey> bug 827590 smoser, is that fix committed to the staged branch?

 16:31:05 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 827590 in nova (Ubuntu Oneiric) "cloud-init does not mount ephemeral0 on /mnt in nova" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/827590

 16:31:33 <smoser> i'm fairly sure that is fix-released

 16:32:00 <Daviey> updted

 16:32:19 <Daviey> smoser: if this is not the case, can you re-open?

 16:32:34 <rbasak> smoser: https://github.com/basak/nova/commits/master/

 16:32:44 <Daviey> bug 845788

 16:32:46 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 845788 in glance (Ubuntu) "update_image in glance.client doesn't add content-length so the swift backend can't chunk" [High,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/845788

 16:33:00 <Daviey> smoser: ^^ status?

 16:33:00 <smoser> thank you rbasak

 16:33:15 <smoser> zul, are you ok for me to upload that ?

 16:33:51 <rbasak> (I will probably revise/squash this)

 16:33:53 <smoser> or is there something else you were wanting to get in there... zul..

 16:34:14 <smoser> rbasak, well, for better or worse, with gerrit and openstack, all merge commits are squashed !

 16:34:32 <rbasak> sounds like fun :)

 16:34:41 <Daviey> smoser: take it out-of-meeting, but if we can get that Fix Released by this time tomorrow it would be good.

 16:34:42 <zul> smoser: i need to go through the list for glance/nova to make sure we arent missing that we should have

 16:34:44 * smoser is embarrased as he has to admit that bzr does a better job of merging branches than git does ... at least that gerrit uses.

 16:35:59 <Daviey> bug 856530 , adam_g has a merge proposal .. does someone in ~ubuntu-server-dev / ~core-dev want to review that?

 16:36:00 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 856530 in nova (Ubuntu Oneiric) "nova user should not be in the nogroup group" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/856530

 16:36:30 <Daviey> okay, i'll do that

 16:36:51 <zul> merged as well

 16:36:56 <Daviey> zul: ok, great!

 16:37:22 <Daviey> Now, what other bugs are we missing?

 16:37:40 <zul> the samba winbind one i need to look at

 16:37:47 <smoser> checking

 16:38:09 <smoser> it would appear to be

 16:38:12 <zul> and the need to fix keystone apparently

 16:38:17 <Daviey> zul: bug number?

 16:38:29 <zul> Daviey: dont have it off the top of my head

 16:38:43 <Daviey> zul: can you let me know what it is after the meeting?

 16:38:52 <zul> Daviey: ack

 16:39:14 <Daviey> zul: I suspect SI will be helping with keystone.. shame they are not in the meeting.

 16:39:45 <zul> i suspect most of the issues i already fixed in the upstream branch anyways

 16:40:01 <zul> just need to roll a new tarball

 16:40:17 <Daviey> Any Juju people here?

 16:40:40 <smoser> wait. roll a new tarball ?

 16:40:45 <smoser> of what ?

 16:40:53 <zul> smoser:  keystone bug fixes

 16:41:56 <lynxman> Daviey: SI is in the meeting :)

 16:42:05 * smoser publicly apologizes for not understanding completely the bug that he was discussing above, and for being rude to daviey.

 16:42:15 <Daviey> smoser: shut up. :)

 16:42:28 <utlemming> #action smoser and daviey to make up

 16:42:28 * meetingology smoser and daviey to make up

 16:42:30 <lynxman> Daviey: negronjl is working with iamfuzz in order to provide a keystone patch (coordinating with zul)

 16:42:35 <Ursinha> lol

 16:42:43 <Daviey> lynxman: Great!

 16:42:47 <SpamapS> Still on "Oneiric Development" ? you guys been discussing the weather in here?

 16:42:47 <lynxman> Ursinha: we'll take pictures

 16:43:04 <Daviey> Ursinha: have anything concerning you?

 16:43:08 <smoser> there is lots of oneiric development to discuss.

 16:43:16 <Ursinha> Daviey, not really no, sir

 16:43:27 <Daviey> SpamapS: Ah!  Anything juju of concern?

 16:44:12 <Daviey> utlemming: we should probably move on.

 16:44:18 <lynxman> I'd like to point out bugs #818177 and #854899

 16:44:18 <SpamapS> Just as an FYI, I'm finishing up some intense testing of juju before uploading the renamed package today..

 16:44:36 <lynxman> SpamapS: great, I'll tailgate you on that one for macports

 16:44:38 <Daviey> SpamapS: awesome

 16:44:53 <utlemming> If anyone has any other Oneiric development topics, please feel free to add to the agenda later.

 16:44:56 <SpamapS> There will also be an FFe for another revision of Juju which will basically be the "eureka" release of Juju .. including local dev and some repository stuff.

 16:44:57 <utlemming> Moving on...

 16:45:05 <utlemming> #topic Ubuntu Server Team Events

 16:45:08 <hallyn> lynxman: yes, bug 818177 was the one i was really hoping jhunt would look at

 16:45:14 <Daviey> lynxman: You do realise most of the meeting has been talking about the second bug you mentioned? :)

 16:45:28 <lynxman> Daviey: I know, but still I had to ;)

 16:45:29 <Daviey> Events!

 16:45:41 <utlemming> I believe that there is an Open Stack event next week

 16:45:52 <lynxman> utlemming: ODS next week in Boston

 16:45:52 <Daviey> ODS

 16:45:52 <Daviey> http://summit.openstack.org/ - lots of the team will be there.

 16:45:56 <Daviey> (I should mention that today is the deadline for raising blueprints for that summit)

 16:46:07 <SpamapS> Have we raised any?

 16:46:20 <zul> yeah 2

 16:46:23 <SpamapS> I may throw one in about S3 test suite for swift and/or using CEPH

 16:46:37 <utlemming> #action Deadline for ODS is today

 16:46:37 * meetingology Deadline for ODS is today

 16:46:46 <Daviey> I have one pending.

 16:46:46 <Daviey> maybe 2. lets take that out of meeting

 16:46:48 <Daviey> When does Oneiric release by the way?

 16:46:48 <SpamapS> Given the significant tap dancing we've had to do to make juju work with nova-objectstore since its "s3-like"

 16:47:04 <utlemming> If there are no other events, lets move on

 16:47:10 <utlemming> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (hggdh)

 16:47:11 <SpamapS> UDS!

 16:47:21 <SpamapS> Its close enough to mention UDS :)

 16:47:36 <Daviey> hggdh: Hello!

 16:47:50 <hggdh> Daviey: yo

 16:48:02 <utlemming> hggdh: Do you have any news for us?

 16:48:03 <Daviey> utlemming: move on, we'll come back

 16:48:08 <hggdh> no, no news

 16:48:11 <hggdh> ..

 16:48:13 <utlemming> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb)

 16:48:17 <smb> Trying to make it shortish: seems at least there is an upstream fix for https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/854050

 16:48:19 <ubottu> Ubuntu bug 854050 in linux (Ubuntu) "BUG at /build/buildd/linux-2.6.38/mm/swapfile.c:255" [Medium,Confirmed]

 16:48:25 <smb> currently building test kernel there

 16:48:33 <smoser> smb, so does that bug actually happen when there is no swap ?

 16:48:45 <smb> Otherwise trying to find out where the events on https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xen/+bug/854829 go

 16:48:46 <ubottu> Ubuntu bug 854829 in xen (Ubuntu) "[Oneiric] Xen HVM: transmit timeouts on emulated 8139cp device" [Medium,Confirmed]

 16:49:09 <smb> smoser, In theory it may

 16:49:26 <smoser> i just wrote it off as not affecting amd64 on ec2 due to "swapfile.c"

 16:49:32 <smb> But maybe not causing the same path to trigger

 16:49:52 <Daviey> smb: bug 790712 ?

 16:49:54 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 790712 in linux (Ubuntu Oneiric) "20110531 i386 server ISO: order 5 allocation failure during install" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/790712

 16:49:58 <smb> Daviey, no

 16:49:58 <smoser> (there is no swap on amd64 instances on ec2 unless the user configures it, which is unlikely)

 16:50:37 <smb> smoser, The explanation somehow was referring to forking under high load which may having some effect in all cases

 16:51:04 <Daviey> smb: bug-790712 is not still viable for release?  SRU/P-Series target?

 16:51:08 <smb> smoser, But I would just empirically let people affected try with a test kernel and that patch

 16:51:17 <smoser> yeah.

 16:51:43 <utlemming> #action smoser, utlemming and smb to follow up on Bug 790712

 16:51:43 * meetingology smoser, utlemming and smb to follow up on Bug 790712

 16:51:45 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 790712 in linux (Ubuntu Oneiric) "20110531 i386 server ISO: order 5 allocation failure during install" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/790712

 16:51:46 <Daviey> smb: Those two you raised, are they viable for release or SRU/P-series?

 16:51:48 <smb> Daviey, There was not much more information since the last time I looked. So as I wrote it is hard to make something off that

 16:52:05 <smoser> i think that was the wrong bug number.

 16:52:26 <utlemming> #action smoser, utlemming and smb to follow up on Bug 854050

 16:52:26 * meetingology smoser, utlemming and smb to follow up on Bug 854050

 16:52:27 <Daviey> yah, utlemming

 16:52:27 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 854050 in linux (Ubuntu) "BUG at /build/buildd/linux-2.6.38/mm/swapfile.c:255" [Medium,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/854050

 16:52:36 <smb> Daviey, first one probably SRU (because it also needs to go into older releases)

 16:52:46 <utlemming> And since we're going to run out of time, let's get moving

 16:53:01 <Daviey> hggdh: I think smb could do with your re-confirmation on bug 790712

 16:53:02 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 790712 in linux (Ubuntu Oneiric) "20110531 i386 server ISO: order 5 allocation failure during install" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/790712

 16:53:03 <smb> Daviey, Second one probably too since I not yet found the trigger. But maybe

 16:53:34 <utlemming> smb: Anything else?

 16:53:40 <Daviey> smb: Okay, thanks!  Really appreciate you and your teams stability you have given this cycle.

 16:53:43 <smb> no, dont think

 16:53:46 <hggdh> Daviey, smb: I will retry it. Since it is sort-of random, I will run a full sequence

 16:53:47 <utlemming> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions regarding Ubuntu ARM Server (NCommander)

 16:54:44 <Daviey> NCommander: any speciic issues/bugs?

 16:54:56 <smoser> utlemming, does that mean those images now boot under qemu ?

 16:54:58 <utlemming> :( the lastest qemu images don't boot though, so I need to look at why

 16:55:04 <Daviey> NCommander: bug 827705, invalid for u-boot.. is that correct?

 16:55:06 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 827705 in u-boot-linaro (Ubuntu) "PXE boot requests non-standard config filename" [Medium,Fix released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/827705

 16:55:20 <NCommander> Daviey: guided partition on omap(4) doesn't work peroperly don't have bug number handy

 16:55:21 <utlemming> #action utlemming to figure out qemu image situation

 16:55:21 * meetingology utlemming to figure out qemu image situation

 16:55:31 <NCommander> Daviey: I'm unfamiliar with that bug in question, will get back with you

 16:55:38 <Daviey> NCommander: what are the minor bug numbers?

 16:55:50 <Daviey> NCommander: thanks

 16:56:15 <Daviey> NCommander: When you find that bug number, can you send it over to me please?

 16:57:21 <Daviey> if there is nothing else, shall we move on?

 16:57:29 <utlemming> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions from the Ubuntu Community
