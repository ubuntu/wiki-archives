{{{
17:09 <+mrevell> Everyone ready?
17:10 < keithcleaveruk> i'm ready
17:10 <+mrevell> Cool :)
17:10 <+mrevell> Hello and thanks for attending this session which is an introduction to Launchpad.
17:10 <+mrevell> Over the next hour, I'll tell you what Launchpad is, what you can do with it and a little about its role in the Ubuntu community.
17:10 <+mrevell> I'll also tell you when you can attend other Launchpad sessions during Ubuntu Open Week.
17:10 <+mrevell> So, what is Launchpad?
17:10 <+mrevell> Launchpad is a suite of tools that help you to take part in free software projects.
17:10 <+mrevell> There are six main Launchpad applications, each dealing with different parts of the development and life of a free software project.
17:11 <+mrevell> * Bug tracker - https://bugs.launchpad.net/
17:11 <+mrevell> * Code hosting - https://code.launchpad.net/
17:11 <+mrevell> * Translations - https://translations.launchpad.net/
17:11 <+mrevell> * Answers (user support) - https://answers.launchpad.net/
17:11 <+mrevell> * Blueprint (feature planning) - https://blueprints.launchpad.net/
17:11 <+mrevell> * Soyuz (package and distribution management) - more about Soyuz later.
17:11 <+mrevell> Projects can pick and choose which applications they want to use but the more of Launchpad that a project uses, the more useful it becomes.
17:11 <+mrevell>  
17:11 <+mrevell> Launchpad and Ubuntu
17:11 <+mrevell>  
17:12 <+mrevell> The Ubuntu community makes extensive use of Launchpad.
17:12 <+mrevell> Ubuntu's bugs are tracked in Launchpad:
17:12 <+mrevell> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu
17:12 <+mrevell> You can translate Ubuntu using Launchpad:
17:12 <+mrevell> https://translations.launchpad.net/ubuntu
17:12 <+mrevell> If you need help with Ubuntu, you can ask a question using Launchpad. Or, if you want to contribute back to the Ubuntu community by helping other people, you can answer their questions:
17:12 <+mrevell> https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu
17:12 <+mrevell> You can propose new features and see future plans for Ubuntu:
17:12 <+mrevell> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu
17:12 <+mrevell> Other projects use Launchpad too. For example, the Bazaar version control system, the Jokosher audio editor, the Zope web framework and others.
17:12 <+mrevell>  
17:12 <+mrevell> People in Launchpad
17:12 <+mrevell>  
17:13 <+mrevell> Before you can start using Launchpad, you need a Launchpad account. Signing up for one is easy. All you need is a working email address. You can find out how to create your Launchpad account in our guide at:
17:13 <+mrevell> https://help.launchpad.net/CreatingYourLaunchpadAccount
17:13 <+mrevell> Having your own Launchpad account will allow you to log into the Ubuntu wiki, use the Canonical shop, order ShipIt CDs and more. It's pretty important if you want to take part in the Ubuntu community.
17:13 <+mrevell> Once you've got your account, you can personalise it with information about yourself and a couple of photos!
17:13 <+mrevell> Launchpad isn't Facebook, though :-)
17:14 <+mrevell> Adding this sort of information to your profile can be really useful.
17:14 <+mrevell> Let's take a look at a real-life Launchpad user profile:
17:14 <+mrevell> https://launchpad.net/~alanpope
17:14 <+mrevell> If you're logged into Launchpad, you can see a short personal statement from Alan, how to contact him and some of what he has worked on in Launchpad.
17:14 <+mrevell> Launchpad is great at bringing free software people together
17:14 <+mrevell> For example: if I come across a feature blueprint that Alan has filed, and I like his idea. Let's say his idea is to create a new Ubuntu application for tracking information about Elvis impersonators.
17:15 <+mrevell> I want to help him flesh the idea out, so I click on his name on the blueprint page and it takes me to his Launchpad profile.
17:15 <+mrevell> On his profile page, I find out how to contact him, what other things he's been working on and I even get an idea of what he looks like!
17:15 <+mrevell> (Take a look at https://launchpad.net/~matthew.revell if you really want to see my picture.)
17:15 <+mrevell> Now, Alan is no longer a meaningless name but he's a person I can start working with.
17:16 <+mrevell> By clicking the tabs at the top of his profile, I can even see what he's been up to in each different part of Launchpad. Clicking the "Answers" tab, I see that he frequently answers people's support requests:
17:16 <+mrevell> https://answers.edge.launchpad.net/~alanpope/
17:16 <+mrevell> Not only can someone with a Launchpad account contact other people but they can also take on certain roles, such as:
17:16 <+mrevell> * bug contact
17:16 <+mrevell> * project driver
17:16 <+mrevell> * official translator.
17:17 <+mrevell> They can also create and join teams.
17:17 <+mrevell>  
17:17 <+mrevell> Teams in Launchpad
17:17 <+mrevell>  
17:17 <+mrevell> So, Alan and I get together and decide that we want to work on our new Elvis impersonator tracker. We've also met some other people who want to get involved.
17:17 <+mrevell> We create a team at:
17:17 <+mrevell> https://launchpad.net/people/+newteam
17:17 <+mrevell> You can see an example of a real team at:
17:17 <+mrevell> https://edge.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-wiki
17:18 <+mrevell> It looks much like a person's profile. You can also see who is a member of the team, either as a list:
17:18 <+mrevell> https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-wiki/+members
17:18 <+mrevell> or as a group photo:
17:18 <+mrevell> https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-wiki/+mugshots
17:18 <+mrevell> Just like people, teams can also be members of other teams.
17:18 <+mrevell> This makes it easy to create a structure for a project or initiative within Launchpad.
17:18 <+mrevell>  The Ubuntu Wiki team is a member of the Ubuntu Documentation Project team, as you can see here:
17:19 <+mrevell> https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-wiki/+participation
17:19 <+mrevell> Teams are like people in other ways.
17:19 <+mrevell> They too can, for example, act as a project or Ubuntu package's bug contact.
17:19 <+mrevell> This means that whenever a new bug is filed against that project or package, everyone in that team is notified.
17:19 <+mrevell> Those team members also get the permissions of a bug contact, such as setting certain restricted bug statuses.
17:20 <+mrevell>  
17:20 <+mrevell> Blueprints
17:20 <+mrevell>  
17:20 <+mrevell> Remember earlier I mentioned blueprints?
17:20 <+mrevell> Well, just like blueprints in the world of architecture, Launchpad blueprints help to turn an idea into something a little more concrete.
17:21 <+mrevell> Blueprints are a flexible way for people to set out an idea, optionally with details of how they'd implement it.
17:21 <+mrevell> Let's take a look at an example:
17:21 <+mrevell> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/free-flash
17:21 <+mrevell> Each blueprint can have a:
17:21 <+mrevell> * "Drafter" - the person who is responsible for setting out the idea
17:21 <+mrevell> * "Assignee" - the person who is going to implement the ideas set out in the blueprint
17:21 <+mrevell> * "Reviewer" - the person who'll check the work on the blueprint.
17:21 <+mrevell> You can see these in the top right of the page, along with an implementation status, priority and a definition.
17:22 <+mrevell> although anyone can create a blueprint, it's the project's drivers who get to choose its priority etc.
17:22 <+mrevell> There's something else in the top-right, too: the "series-goal".
17:22 <+mrevell> Launchpad helps projects and distributions to plan their releases in a number of ways.
17:22 <+mrevell> A distro-series or release-series is a major line of development.
17:23 <+mrevell> In Ubuntu's case, Gutsy is one of these distro-series.
17:23 <+mrevell> An important link on this page is "Read the full specification".
17:23 <+mrevell>  Launchpad Blueprint isn't designed to replace the wikis, mailing lists and other ways that projects use to organise themselves.
17:23 <+mrevell> Instead, it helps track useful meta-data about the information held on these wikis.
17:23 <+mrevell> So, the Ubuntu wiki is where the Ubuntu community stores the meat of its blueprints.
17:24 <+mrevell> There's a lot more to say about blueprints but we don't have time in this session. Join us at 17.00 UTC on Friday to learn more about Blueprint.
17:24 <+mrevell> However, before we leave blueprints, I'd like to point out the small white cross on a red background; it looks like a Swiss flag.
17:24 <+mrevell>  
17:24 <+mrevell> Mentoring
17:24 <+mrevell>  
17:24 <+mrevell> Remember I said earlier that Launchpad helps free software people to work together?
17:24 <+mrevell> Mentoring is a fantastic example of just how Launchpad does it.
17:25 <+mrevell> Let's say I see the blueprint we've been looking at.
17:25 <+mrevell> Imagine I'm a keen but inexperienced developer.
17:25 <+mrevell> I really want to help implement a free Flash player for Ubuntu. I don't know where to start though.
17:25 <+mrevell> However, I see that Alexander Sack is offering to mentor people on this.
17:25 <+mrevell> I click his name and I'm taken to a page listing his blueprints.
17:25 <+mrevell> Another click on the "Overview" tab and I can find out how to contact him.
17:26 <+mrevell> Now, Alexander can help me learn how I can use my skills to help progress this blueprint and to learn the ways of the Ubuntu community.
17:26 <+mrevell> Each offer of mentoring is linked to a particular Launchpad team.
17:26 <+mrevell> This makes it easy to find offers that you're particularly interested in.
17:26 <+mrevell> Ubuntu's Mozilla team, for example:
17:26 <+mrevell> https://edge.launchpad.net/~mozillateam/+mentoring
17:26 <+mrevell> Both bug reports and blueprints can have offers of mentoring.
17:27 < PriceChild> mrevell, remove the edge. from links ;)
17:27 <+mrevell> PriceChild: Thanks, although they should redirect.
17:27 <+mrevell> :)
17:27 <+mrevell>  
17:27 <+mrevell> Bug Tracker
17:27 <+mrevell>  
17:27 <+mrevell> For many people in the Ubuntu community, reporting and managing bugs accounts for a lot of the time they spend using Launchpad.
17:27 <+mrevell> Let's take a look:
17:27 <+mrevell> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu
17:27 <+mrevell> Reporting bugs using Launchpad's web interface is pretty easy.
17:28 <+mrevell> Simply type in a summary of the bug you've found and Launchpad will search all existing bug reports to check that the bug hasn't already been reported.
17:28 <+mrevell> If you see that the bug has been reported, you can subscribe to it and get email updates when something changes.
17:29 <+mrevell> However, if the bug hasn't been reported, all you need do is describe what you found in more detail.
17:29 <+mrevell> A member of the Ubuntu bugs team will try to confirm that you bug exists and give it an appropriate importance level.
17:29 <+mrevell> Other people can also add comments or upload screenshots and other attachments to help the relevant developers understand the problem.
17:29 <+mrevell> You can also use the bug tracker through its email interface.
17:30 <+mrevell> This makes it particularly easy to automate your use of the bug tracker or may be of interest if you prefer not to use the web interface.
17:30 <+mrevell> You can find out more at: https://help.launchpad.net/BugTrackerEmailInterface
17:30 <+mrevell> There's something else that's particularly special about the way Launchpad deals with bugs.
17:31 <+mrevell>  Briefly: bugs in free software can pop up in almost anywhere!
17:31 <+mrevell> This is partly because free software projects share code and rely on libraries provided by other projects.
17:31 <+mrevell> It's also true that if you find a bug whilst using Ubuntu, that bug may have originated in, for example, code provided by the Firefox or OpenOffice.org projects.
17:31 <+mrevell> Launchpad makes it easy for different communities to work together on the same bug.
17:32 <+mrevell> If you want to know more about this or any other part of the bug tracker there are two sessions you should attend:
17:32 <+mrevell> 19.00 UTC today for "Bug triage"
17:32 <+mrevell> 17.00 UTC Thursday for "Managing bugs with Ubuntu".
17:32 <+mrevell> One cool thing we'll tell you about on Thursday is that you can link bug reports to branches of code that fix that bug.
17:32 <+mrevell>  
17:32 <+mrevell> Code hosting
17:32 <+mrevell>  
17:32 <+mrevell> Launchpad works with the Bazaar version control system. Bazaar is a distributed version control system.
17:32 <+mrevell> That means everyone has their own code repository (called a branch in Bazaar terms).
17:33 <+mrevell> Unlike with CVS or Subversion, you don't need special permissions to start work on someone else's code.
17:33 <+mrevell> Instead, you create your own branch and work on that.
17:33 <+mrevell> It's then easy for the project to merge your changes back into the original branch.
17:33 <+mrevell> And hosting a branch publicly is really easy. All you need is a standard web server and you can also do it through Launchpad.
17:33 <+mrevell> aunchpad makes Bazaar even more useful.
17:34 <+mrevell> s/aunchpad/Launchpad :)
17:34 <+mrevell> One of the problems with distributed version control is that it can be hard to find all the branches associated with your project.
17:34 <+mrevell> Launchpad solves that. It has a browsable code catalogue for each project.
17:34 <+mrevell> Anyone can register their branch to show up in your project's branch list
17:34 <+mrevell> You can see how active each branch is, read the developer's commit messages and create your own working copy of that code, complete with full version control,  at any time.
17:35 <+mrevell> Take a look at the branches for Ubuntu's Update Manager: https://code.launchpad.net/update-manager
17:35 <+mrevell> You can see the main branch but people have also created their own branches.
17:36 <+mrevell> Bazaar makes it really easy for development to take different directions, while Launchpad helps make sure it's all accessible from one place.
17:36 <+mrevell> Now, take a look at the Bazaar project's branches: https://code.launchpad.net/bzr
17:36 <+mrevell> Notice the small bug icons?
17:36 <+mrevell> If you create a branch to fix specific bugs, you can link the branch to the relevant bug reports. The bug icons indicate there's a link.
17:37 <+mrevell> With a link between a bug report and the branch that fixes it, everyone can now easily get hold of a bug's solution.
17:37 <+mrevell> On that page you can also see several branches registered to the Bazaar Developers team. These are team branches.
17:37 <+mrevell> They're hosted centrally, on Launchpad, and only members of the Bazaar Developers team can commit to them.
17:37 <+mrevell> Team branches are ideal for working together on a major line of development. Anyone can still create their own copy, though.
17:37 <+mrevell> Finally, Launchpad can make a continuous import of almost any CVS or Subversion repository hosted on the internet.
17:38 <+mrevell> This means that you can create your own Bazaar branch of the code and your own line of development.
17:38 <+mrevell> With Bazaar's bzr-svn plugin, and the appropriate commit access, you can even commit your code back to Subversion repositories.
17:38 <+mrevell> You can find out more about hosting code with Launchpad in our session here at 18.00 UTC on Thursday.
17:38 <+mrevell> You can find out more about Bazaar here at 19.00 UTC on Friday.
17:39 <+mrevell>  
17:39 <+mrevell> Translations
17:39 <+mrevell>  
17:39 <+mrevell> Launchpad Translations, formerly known as Rosetta, takes the pain out of translating software into different languages.
17:39 <+mrevell> Let's take a quick look at Ubuntu's Translations page:
17:39 <+mrevell> https://translations.launchpad.net/ubuntu
17:39 <+mrevell> There you get a quick overview of how well Ubuntu 7.10 (Gutsy) has been translated into many different languages.
17:40 <+mrevell> Much of the free software world uses GNU's GetText. Developers put markers in their code to show where a GetText should insert a string of interface text.
17:40 <+mrevell> GetText uses a certain file format to store translated strings.
17:40 <+mrevell> Although it's simple enough to edit this format by hand, the truth is that translators shouldn't have to be coders.
17:40 <+mrevell> Launchpad shields translators from the underlying complexities and gives them a simple web interface.
17:41 <+mrevell> Launchpad currently works with 243 languages and has more than 820,000 strings in its database.
17:41 <+mrevell> Naturally, the same phrases occur in the interfaces of many applications.
17:41 <+mrevell> When someone is translating an application, Launchpad checks its database to see if it has already seen those strings in that language.
17:41 <+mrevell> If it has, it suggests them to the translator.
17:41 <+mrevell> Launchpad also gives teams different ways to ensure they get the right balance between control of translations and encouraging community participation.
17:42 < ksivaji> lol
17:42 <+mrevell> From fully open - where anyone can translate - to totally restricted, where only pre-appointed translators can make translations and suggestions.
17:42 <+mrevell> Of course, development work usually starts on a new release while the stable release is still in use. Launchpad allows multiple translation efforts to take place concurrently for the same project.
17:42 <+mrevell> So, translation can begin on a new release and continue on the stable release.
17:43 <+mrevell> You can find out more about Launchpad Translations at 16.00 UTC Friday.
17:43 <+mrevell>  
17:43 <+mrevell> Answers
17:43 <+mrevell>  
17:43 <+mrevell> Mailing lists and web forums are traditionally where free software projects answer user support questions. However, it can be difficult to capture that knowledge and make it easily available to the community.
17:43 <+mrevell> Some people are also intimidated by mailing lists or the initiation rituals of some forums :)
17:43 <+mrevell> Launchpad's Answer Tracker is a simple way for people to ask questions about a project.
17:44 <+mrevell> Anyone can offer an answer and the original questioner can highlight the answer they found most useful.
17:44 <+mrevell> Members of a project's community can sign up to be support contacts, meaning they receive an email each time a new question is asked about that project. Support contacts can also identify which questions are FAQ. FAQ - along with a good answer - are then easily searchable and available to anyone.
17:44 <+mrevell> People can ask questions in their own language(s). Support contacts can choose to receive notification of questions asked in their preferred languages.
17:44 <+mrevell> Importantly, all of the questions and answers are easily searchable, meaning that they build into a knowledge-base for the project.
17:44 <+mrevell>  
17:44 <+mrevell> Personal Package Archives
17:45 <+mrevell>  
17:45 <+mrevell> Remember earlier I spoke about Soyuz? Well, this is the part of the Launchpad that helps put Ubuntu together.
17:45 <+mrevell> The part of Soyuz you're most likely to come across is Personal Package Archives.
17:45 <+mrevell> With Personal Package Archives (PPA), you can build and publish binary Ubuntu packages for multiple architectures simply by uploading an Ubuntu source package to Launchpad.
17:46 <+mrevell> If you've got a Launchpad account, you've signed the Ubuntu code of conduct and you've got an GPG key in your Launchpad profile, you can get your own PPA.
17:46 <+mrevell> Your PPA gives you:
17:46 <+mrevell> * An APT repository of up to 1 gigabyte for material licensed in accordance with the PPA Terms of Use.
17:46 <+mrevell> * Binary packages built for x86 and AMD64 architectures against Ubuntu.
17:46 <+mrevell> * A web front-end where Launchpad users can browse and search for your packages.
17:47 <+mrevell> You can find out how to use your PPA at:
17:47 <+mrevell> https://help.launchpad.net/PPAQuickStart/
17:47 <+mrevell> and in our session at 15.00 UTC on Friday.
17:47 <+mrevell> This is one of the most exciting areas of development for Launchpad at the moment.
17:47 <+mrevell> PA is in beta at the moment, so you'll need to join the Launchpad Beta Testers team. In fact, I'd recommend that to everyone!
17:47 <+mrevell> s/PA/PPA - cut and paste error
17:48 <+mrevell> Find out how in our guide:
17:48 <+mrevell> https://help.launchpad.net/JoiningLaunchpadBetaTesters
17:48 <+mrevell>  
17:48 <+mrevell> What Next?
17:48 <+mrevell>  
17:48 <+mrevell> There's so much to tell you about Launchpad.
17:48 <+mrevell> I've just about covered the basics.
17:48 <+mrevell> So, please do join us for the other sessions this week and come visit us on the launchpad-users mailing list at:
17:48 <+mrevell> http://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/launchpad-users
17:49 <+mrevell> Of course, two important sessions to come to, if you're curious about Launchpad, are our Q&A sessions with Launchpad superstar kiko :)
17:49 <+mrevell> They're at:
17:49 <+mrevell> 18.00 UTC tomorrow and
17:49 <+mrevell> 19.00 UTC tomorrow.
17:49 <+mrevell> And of course
17:49 <+mrevell> I'll tackle as many questions as I can now. Let me go read the backlog :)
17:50 <+mrevell> < bullgard4> QUESTION: Very new Launchpad bug reports are invisible to even Launchpad subsribers. What is the reason and what is your policy towards changing this?
17:50 <+mrevell> Hi bullgard4 - I'm afraid I'm not sure what you mean. In what way are they invisible?
17:50 <@popey> private
17:50 <+mrevell> Are we talking about bugs filed against Launchpad?
17:52 <+mrevell> Okay, well, I'll move on for now.
17:52 <+mrevell> < nealmcb> QUESTION: Is there a way to search for a launchpad profile by irc nick, or wiki name?  Without google.....
17:52 <+mrevell> Right now, no. Although we may have a bug report filed about this. If not, I shall file it after this session!
17:53 <+mrevell>  < savvas> QUESTION: When asking for a login, can the user be redirected to launchpad.net? Example, try to login when viewing a bug report, the domain remains bugs.launchpad.net instead of launchpad.net - this causes problems with some password saving applications, such as firefox's password manager, it results to multiple entries for the same website.
17:54 <+mrevell> The simple answer is "No". However, we're always keen to hear how we can improve Launchpad. I don't think I've seen a bug filed about this. Again, I'll be happy to file one after this session, or you can file it yourself at:
17:54 <+mrevell> https://bugs.launchpad.net/launchpad
17:54 < savvas> ah launchpad project
17:54 < savvas> ok
17:55 <+mrevell>  < greg-g> QUESTION: To have more than one adminstrator for a team, must I create a new group "team-admins" and set that as the group administrator?  Or can I just add to a list of approved members who can adminstrate the team?
17:57 <+mrevell> greg-g: Teams can have many administrators. As the team owner, visit your team's membership list and from there you can upgrade individual members to be admins.
17:57 <+mrevell> <savvas> so.. let me see if I got this straight: the person that creates a blueprint means they must develop the solution/application for that blueprint, or someone else can pick it up?
17:58 <+mrevell> savvas: Anyone can pick the blueprint up and get to work on it. It's up to developers to coordinate with each other as to who does what.
17:58 <+mrevell> <savvas> QUESTION: how are bugs marked as "high" or "low" importance; how do ubuntu members define which is which? by the number of users reporting the bug?
17:58 <+mrevell> That's an ubuntu question really. Join the bug triage session coming up next :)
17:59 <+mrevell> <nealmcb> QUESTION: What is a good structure for a small code development team like loco-django.  Just use one team for simplicity?  Have an overall team for users and a -dev team to own the code?  When is a -bugs team useful, in practice?  Is there a set of best practices or recipies out there?
18:00 <+mrevell> It's difficult to say without knowing more about what you want to achieve. For example: a separate bugs team to set as a bug contact can be useful if you have some developers who don't want to receive notification of all the bug reports when they're made.
18:00 <+mrevell> nealmcb: What I would say, though, is that this is the sort of thing I'd like to add to the Launchpad Help wiki. So, for now, I'd suggest we have a chat on the launchpad-users list.
18:01 <+mrevell> <nxvl> QUESTIONS: is there any easy way to search ALL open bugs in ubuntu, or the marked for mentoring, or is needed to enter to the specific packages. I want it because for starters is easier to browse all the bugs and find out on what we want to help
18:01 <+mrevell> nxvl: You can search all bugs in Ubuntu at:
18:02 <+mrevell> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu
18:02 <+mrevell> QUESTION: We've seen some tantalizing hints of OpenID working in the wild with launchpad as a provider.  What are the plans going forward?  We're looking forward to reducing the need for multiple logins for ubuntu activists.
18:03 <+mrevell> nealmcb: We're keen to help the Ubuntu community in this way. I don't have any exciting information right now, although we have been talking to the Ubuntu Forums teams to see if we can help by providing authentication for the forums. So, if you have specific suggestions or anything, please mail me.
18:04 <+mrevell> <gautad1> QUESTION:  Whats that Karma stuff?
18:04 <+mrevell> gautad1: A useful way to show how active someone is in launchpad. Very simply: the more you do in Launchpad, the higher your karma.
18:04 <+mrevell> <nansub0111> QUESTION: will there ever be something like Launchpad-Lite with similar functionality to Google Code hosting but using Bzr instead?
18:04 <+mrevell>  nansub0111 I'm intrigued to hear more about your ideas for this! Please mail me :)
18:05 <+mrevell> <nealmcb> QUESTION: We hear there are plans to provide a stable API so other apps can more easily query and parse launchpad data, which would be VERY helpful.  Any updates?  Any hints on how you plan to structure the API?
18:05 <+mrevell> Last question this
18:05 <+mrevell> Please mail me or join Kiko's Q&A sessions to have answers to other questions
18:06 <+mrevell> nealmcb: A stable public API is something that we believe strongly in. I'm not a developer, tbh, do I can't really give much info on the API. However, it is coming and I know we'd be keen to hear your ideas/requirements.
18:06 <+mrevell> Okay, thanks everyone, mail me - matthew.revell@canonical.com!}}}
