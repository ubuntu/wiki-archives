== Who Am I ==
I've been using linux since about 1998, starting with an older copy of Slackware and Sam's Teach Yourself Linux in 24 Hours book(where the CD came from). After that i started using Red Hat. 
The past few months, I've been learning C++ and i also switched to Kubuntu. I was very impressed and decided to start contributing to Kubuntu.
