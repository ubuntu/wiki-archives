=== Experience ===

In order to better define user's needs could be interesting deploy a part of the survey with question in Likert scale (or something similar) asking questions concerned with the ubuntu experience.
The idea is write a sentence and ask to the user how agree with the sentence (totally - partly - non so much - completely disagree) 

example: questions are not divided into the previous categories and are unordered (as they come out of my mind)

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| I had many trouble during the installation
|-
| I found quite awful default ubuntu look & feel
|-
| I need a much better way to change my desktop wallpaper
|-
| I havent understand how to modify the splash screen
|-
| I wonder why by default there are three menu instead of one (programs, places, system)
|-
| I found too much differencies between ubuntu and my old windows envirnoment
|-
| I havent understand how to add programs
|-
| I havent understand why some programs cannot be installed
|-
| I havent understand what dependencies means
|-
| I consider system, preferences and places menus quite useless
|-
| system, preferences and places menus are not well defined
|-
| I tried to install xgl but there are too much ways to install it which is the best?
|-
| There are too many wikies that talk about the same argument
|-
| No-one in the forums answered to my question
|-
| I consider the search button quite useless
|-
| It takes too much time to boot the system
|-
| I don't care about stealing software
|-
| I found many difficulties in network setup
|-
| I would like to found a more detailed "supported hardware" section
|-
| I used many GNU/Linux distros better than ubuntu
|-
| The O.S must protect me from the dangers of the net
|-
| It's not important my direct involvement in the security issues, everything must be done by OS
|-
| I need the total control of the system
|-
| It's important that my OS is totally free
|}

=== let the user vote ===

Another IMHO part is the following:

It could be interesting give users (whatever they are) a chance to vote somewhat

Example:

In order to define your ideal Operating system, which of theese sentences are more accurated?
give a vote from 1 to 10 where 1 = completely indifferent 10 = definitely important

security
multimedia
internet
office
server
development
graphic
