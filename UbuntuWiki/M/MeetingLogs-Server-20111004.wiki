16:12:33 <hallyn_> hmmmmmm

16:12:44 <jamespage> I've been debugging that with jhunt today

16:12:48 <Daviey> That is blocked on seeing if it is a duplicate of the udev race, no?

16:14:21 <jamespage> Daviey: pretty sure it is  - lemme catchup with jhunt again - in all likelyhood it is a dupe

16:14:24 <hallyn_> jamespage: any progress not reflected in the bugs or email yet?

16:15:02 <jamespage> hallyn_: action me to follow up with jhunt

16:15:16 <jamespage> but no progress - jhunt has had remote access to the system

16:15:29 <jamespage> its reproducable but no fix yet

16:15:55 <hallyn_> #action jamespage to follow up with jhunt on udev/lvm bugs including 801494

16:16:07 * hallyn_ Deadline for ODS is today

16:16:14 <jamespage> \o/

16:16:24 * hallyn_ smoser, utlemming and smb to follow up on Bug 854050

16:16:25 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 854050 in linux (Ubuntu) "BUG at /build/buildd/linux-2.6.38/mm/swapfile.c:255" [Medium,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/854050

16:16:36 <hallyn_> utlemming: ?

16:17:26 <hallyn_> sounds from the bug report like it is solved?

16:17:54 <utlemming> I'm still testing that. New AMI's are being spun for testing.

16:18:16 <utlemming> mark that for follow-up next week

16:18:28 <hallyn_> ok

16:18:38 <hallyn_> #action smoser, utlemming and smb to follow up on Bug 854050

16:19:50 <hallyn_> utlemming: ?

16:20:25 <hallyn_> will mark for next week too...

16:20:30 <utlemming> qemu images will need a bit of work.

16:20:42 <utlemming> the problem is being caused by bootloader options

16:20:53 <hallyn_> is there anything more specific we can mark in a new action?

16:21:07 <utlemming> not really

16:21:09 <hallyn_> #action utlemming to figure out qemu image situation (carry-over)

16:21:09 * meetingology` utlemming to figure out qemu image situation (carry-over)

16:21:11 <hallyn_> ok, thanks :)

16:21:19 <hallyn_> #topic Oneiric Development

16:21:30 <hallyn_> Daviey: robbiew: ^

16:21:44 <robbiew> there is none

16:21:45 <robbiew> lol

16:21:54 <robbiew> just bug fixing :D

16:21:56 <robbiew> ship it!

16:21:58 <hallyn_> and how

16:22:11 <hallyn_> moving on,

16:22:14 <hallyn_> #topic Ubuntu Server Team Events

16:22:31 <hallyn_> obviously, openstack conference right now.  anything else coming up?

16:22:53 <hallyn_> ok, moving on

16:22:58 <hallyn_> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (hggdh)

16:23:07 <hallyn_> hggdh: hi again

16:25:18 <hallyn_> moving on,

16:25:21 <hallyn_> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb)

16:25:29 <hallyn_> smb is not around

16:25:38 <Daviey> hallyn_: Just adding to the development section - things look good.. but we need more, more testing.

16:26:11 <hallyn_> Daviey: after thursday, final freeze is over?  no more changes at all?

16:26:44 <hallyn_> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions regarding Ubuntu ARM Server (NCommander)

16:26:50 <hallyn_> NCommander is not around

16:26:58 <hallyn_> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions from the Ubuntu Community

16:27:30 <hallyn_> hi, anything to bring up?

16:27:49 <Daviey> hallyn_: I don't think after RC (Thursday) there will be no changes.. but there will be limited changes.

16:28:07 <lynxman> my only concern on that side is puppet, but spoke with Daviey already about it

16:28:08 <Daviey> Note that things we care about in Universe can still be fixed upto 36 hours befoere release.

16:28:09 <hallyn_> Daviey: phew

16:28:11 <Daviey> before*

16:28:40 <hallyn_> i assume low priority bugs should wait for an SRU

16:28:50 <hallyn_> (thinkgs like 'command_names=1' in /etc/lvm.conf)

16:29:32 <hallyn_> #topic Open Discussion

16:30:33 <lynxman> Just as a question, are we finally shipping keystone in Oneiric?

16:31:09 <Daviey> lynxman: we always have been, but it's not in main or integrated by default.

16:31:18 <Daviey> NFI if it works. :)

16:31:28 <lynxman> Daviey: it doesn't (at least not much)

16:31:45 <Daviey> lynxman: What bugs have you raised with the issues you had?

16:32:07 <lynxman> Daviey: we raised bugs directly with upstream, keystone mysql integration with innodb is broken due to bad schema definitions

16:32:19 <lynxman> Daviey: also another bug raised with upstream about sqlite3 code

16:33:00 <Daviey> lynxman: we really need Ubuntu tasks on the bugs if they are going to be fixed in Ubuntu.

16:33:31 <Daviey> lynxman: If you are able, and willing to help address these issues for Oneiric - that would rock. my. world.

16:33:35 <lynxman> Daviey: yeah noted, but this one affected upstream directly :)

16:33:52 <lynxman> Daviey: it's too broken for oneiric I'm afraid :/ ttx is pushing for a diablo keystone version "coming soon"

16:34:11 <lynxman> Daviey: we had lots of issues with it last week and we finally abandoned implementation for the moment

16:34:37 <Daviey> The keystone honcho and ttx are here this week, i'll grab them for gudance.

16:34:48 <Daviey> [ACTION]

16:34:48 * meetingology` 

16:35:10 <hallyn_> #action Daviey to talk to ttx and keystone honcho for guidance about oneiric package

16:35:10 * meetingology` Daviey to talk to ttx and keystone honcho for guidance about oneiric package

16:35:32 <hallyn_> any one else have some actions for Daviey ?

16:35:44 * hallyn_ looks over at his dirty car

16:35:58 <hallyn_> then it only remains to,
