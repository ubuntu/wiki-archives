__TOC__

== Main inclusion report for gtk2-engines-gtk-qt ==

# ''Availability:'' In universe for all architectures
# ''Rationale:'' This package increases KDE and Gnome integration by letting GTK applications use the Qt theme.  This is very desireable for Kubuntu users.
# ''Security:'' No security history.
# ''Quality assurance:''
** No configuration is required by the user after installing.  Same drawing errors noticed but no major bugs reported.
** There was a problem with crashes using menus in Cairo GTK which has now been fixed
# ''Standards compliance:'' The package meets debian-policy and FHS, however the package in Ubuntu has been altered to not use shlibs so that gtk is not a depencency allowing it to be on the Kubuntu CD.
# ''Dependencies:'' All dependencies are in main.
