== Packaging Jams ==

An Ubuntu Packaging Jam is an event in which packaging skills are taught to a group of people. Jams are typically delivered by Ubuntu LoCo teams, and they are an excellent means of not only providing events for a LoCo team but also a great way to get more people involved in Ubuntu development.
