=== Requirements ===

# ''Availability:'' <nowiki>[[http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/d/dontzap]]</nowiki>; available for all supported architectures
# ''Rationale:''
** X.org has changed to disable by default the ctrl-alt-backspace shortcut for killing X
** For Ubuntu we have opted to accept this change to the default, but wish to provide a mechanism (other than hand-editing xorg.conf) for users to toggle this on or off as desired.
** This package implements a command line tool that can be called directly, or by the appropriate GNOME and KDE GUI administrative interfaces to change the settings.
0. ''Security:''
** <nowiki>[[http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=dontzap|CVE entries]]</nowiki>: '''none'''
** <nowiki>[[http://secunia.com/search/?search=dontzap|Secunia history]]</nowiki>: '''none'''
** Any binaries running as root or suid/sgid ?  The utility needs to modify xorg.conf so won't really work if used as non-root, however this package makes no provisions to obtain or retain such privileges, leaving it up to the caller (which presumably would use policykit or other appropriate mechanisms)
** Network activity: does it open any port ?  '''No''' Does it handle incoming network data ?  '''No'''
** Does it directly (not through a library) process binary (video, audio, etc) or structured (PDF, etc) data ?  '''No'''
** Any source code review performed ?  '''Yes''' I've reviewed all of the code of this package
0. ''Quality assurance:''
** In what situations does the package not work out of the box without configuration ?  '''None'''
** Does the package ask any debconf questions higher than priority 'medium' ?  '''No'''
** <nowiki>[[http://bugs.debian.org/src:dontzap|Debian bugs]]</nowiki>: '''None'''
** <nowiki>[[http://packages.qa.debian.org/d/dontzap.html|Maintenance in Debian]]</nowiki> is frenetic/vigorous/calm/dead ?  '''Not in debian yet'''
** <nowiki>[[https://edge.launchpad.net/x-kit|Upstream]]</nowiki> is frenetic/vigorous/calm/dead ?  '''Calm'''
** <nowiki>[[https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/x-kit//|Upstream bug tracker]]</nowiki>: '''No known bugs for dontzap'''
** Hardware: Does this package deal with hardware and if so how exotic is it ?   '''No'''
** Is there a test suite in the upstream source or packaging ?  '''No''' Is it enabled to run in the build ?  '''No'''
0. ''UI standards:''
** User-visible strings are internationalized using standard gettext system ?   '''No'''  As a command line tool, probably not needed
** Package with translatable strings builds a PO template during package build ?  '''No'''
** End-user applications ship a desktop file ?  '''No''' not a GUI program
0. ''Standards compliance:'' 
** <nowiki>[[http://www.pathname.com/fhs/|FHS]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[http://www.de.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/|Debian Policy]]</nowiki> compliance ?  '''Yes'''
** <nowiki>[[http://www.netfort.gr.jp/~dancer/column/libpkg-guide/libpkg-guide.html|Debian library packaging guide]]</nowiki> standards compliance ?  '''N/A'''
** Packaging system?  '''cdbs'''  Patch system ? '''bzr''' Any packaging oddities ? '''No'''
0. ''Dependencies:''
** python-xkit, python-central, python-dev
** Are these all in main ?  '''Yes''' 
0. ''Maintenance:''
** How much maintenance is this package likely to need ?  '''None'''
** Who is responsible for monitoring the quality of this package and fixing its bugs ?  '''Alberto Milone''' Are they Ubuntu or Debian developers ? '''Ubuntu developer'''
0. ''Background information:''
** Tool for toggling DontZap option in xorg.conf
** What do upstream call this software ?  '''dontzap'''
0. ''Internationalization:''
** Are graphical applications translatable? Do they support gettext?  '''Not GUI'''
