19:44 < jesgui> buenas tardes
19:44 <+LaserJock> as this is spur-of-the-moment I'll give you a brief intro to Edubuntu
19:44 < jesgui> saludos a todos
19:44 <+LaserJock> and then we can go to any questions
19:44 <@PriceChild> !es > jesgui (see pm from ubotu)
19:44 < LjL> jesgui: saludos, por favor hable en #ubuntu-classroom-chat no aqui
19:44 < jesgui> hola
19:44 < jesgui> ???
19:45 <+LaserJock> First of all, Edubuntu is a derivative or "flavor" of Ubuntu geared specifically toward educational settings
19:45 -!- mode/#ubuntu-classroom [+o LjL] by ChanServ
19:45 -!- mode/#ubuntu-classroom [+b %jesgui!*@*] by LjL
19:45 < alfermp> thank for the tip jesgui
19:45 <+LaserJock> it is a fairly small team
19:45 -!- mode/#ubuntu-classroom [-z] by PriceChild
19:45 <+LaserJock> but we've managed to produce a top-notch education distribution
19:46 <+LaserJock> Edubuntu started out as an OS for children
19:46 <+LaserJock> focusing around a playful theme and kid-friendly applications
19:47 <+LaserJock> it has since grown into a full-fledged educational operating system
19:47 <+LaserJock> including the latest in LTSP (Linux Terminal Server Project)
19:47 -!- ServerMode/#ubuntu-classroom [+z] by irc.freenode.net
19:47 <+LaserJock> educational applications for a wide range of educational settings
19:48 -!- mode/#ubuntu-classroom [+o LaserJock] by ChanServ
19:48 <@LaserJock> ok, so I'll take some questions
19:48 -!- mode/#ubuntu-classroom [+v stgraber] by ChanServ
19:49 <@LaserJock> QUESTION: can you sum up main differences from standard ubuntu installation to edubuntu ?
19:49 <@LaserJock> that is indeed a common question
19:49 <@LaserJock> the most prominent technical difference is that the Edubuntu Classroom Server CD comes with LTSP
19:49 <@LaserJock> and will do an automatic setup where possible
19:50 <@LaserJock> we try to keep the basic desktop applications as close as possible to Ubuntu
19:50 <@LaserJock> so you can think of Edubuntu as Ubuntu + LTSP + educational apps + different artwork
19:51 <@LaserJock> in the future we may develop the differences more
19:51 <@LaserJock> which may be very exciting for people interested in Linux in education
19:51 <@LaserJock> QUESTION: Are there any plans to adapt the thin-client model for businesses to use?
19:51 <@LaserJock> yes indeed
19:52 <@LaserJock> the Ubuntu server team will be dealing a lot with LTSP for the next release
19:52 <@LaserJock> we need better support of network authentication, things like easy LDAP and SMB setup
19:53 <@LaserJock> QUESTION: In the vein of Linux taking over the world by influencing youth, does the Edubuntu project  have any plans for marketing (for lack of a better word) Edubuntu to schools?
19:53 <@LaserJock> of course
19:53 <@LaserJock> getting Edubuntu into school systems is a major goal
19:54 <@LaserJock> we'd love to help students, teachers, and school administrators in "converting" their schools to Edubuntu
19:54 <@LaserJock> the edubuntu.org site has some info on that
19:55 <@LaserJock> QUESTION: Is edubuntu also meant for a first contact with unix like operating systems, or more of a  general education platform?
19:55 <@LaserJock> I would say general education platform
19:55 <@LaserJock> obviously it's also a great platform to learn unix-like OSs
19:56 <@LaserJock> but we'd like to include things like moodle and various teaching tools
19:56 <@LaserJock> QUESTION: since ubuntu is a newer product, what suggestions do you have for convincing network admins  that edubuntu is just as reliable (if not more so) than standbys like suse?
19:57 <@LaserJock> I would point a lot a Debian, actually
19:57 <@LaserJock> Edubuntu and Ubuntu are built on a solid Debian base
19:57 <@LaserJock> and Debian has a long and solid histry as a great server OS
19:58 <@LaserJock> I would also point to existing schools that are using Edubuntu successfully
19:58 < musashi1> examples?
19:58 <@LaserJock> QUESTION: With tablet and solidstate computers becoming popular in classrooms, because they are tough and  cheap, is Edubuntu looking at incorporating some of the features of these hardware  architectures, specifically designed for schools?  The Asus Eee computer looks like it is going  to be especially popular, as is the One Laptop Per Child.
19:58 <@LaserJock> musashi1: of schools?
19:58 < musashi1> yes
19:58 <@LaserJock> well
19:58 <@LaserJock> I don't have a handy list on me
19:59 <@LaserJock> but the edubuntu-users list would give you a great place to look/ask
19:59 -!- mode/#ubuntu-classroom [-o PriceChild] by ChanServ
19:59 <@LaserJock> you can find edubuntu-users on lists.ubuntu.com
19:59 <@LaserJock> Edubuntu is looking towards projects like OLPC and Intel's ClassmatePC project
20:00 <@LaserJock> I've been working on the Intel machine lately just seeing how things would work with *buntu on it
20:00 <@LaserJock> QUESTION: Does Edubuntu have special ties with Ubuntu Server, do you think there will ever develop a  Edubuntu Teachers' Edition or something similar?
20:00 <@LaserJock> I don't think anything special other than we have a common interest in server infrastructure
20:01 <@LaserJock> we're going to be working with the server team on LTSP and network authentication as I said before
20:01 <@LaserJock> Edubuntu is indeed a Teachers' Edition
20:02 <@LaserJock> we're just needing to work more on adding good software for it
20:02 <@LaserJock> QUESTION: Should we be evanglizing Edubuntu as a Child's dekstop to parents? or is more a school setting?
20:02 < nixternal> don't forget the need for devs too LaserJock
20:02 <@LaserJock> I think it could definately be both
20:02 <@LaserJock> nixternal: yes, thanks
20:02 <@LaserJock> right now I would say Edubuntu is only limited by the available hands
20:02 <@LaserJock> we have lots of great ideas
20:02  * nixternal also makes a quick note to non-devs that there is plenty of documentation work for Edubuntu as well
20:02 <@LaserJock> the community is great
20:03 <@LaserJock> but we need hands to do the work
20:03 <@LaserJock> Edubuntu can defiantely be suitable for a child's desktop
20:03 <@LaserJock> some people have used it down to 18month olds
20:03 <@LaserJock> and I'm working on getting it going for universities
20:04 <@LaserJock> the common goal is "Education"
20:04 <@LaserJock>  QUESTION: Is there any plan for a non-LTSP Edubuntu distribution for those who want the installation to be
20:04 <@LaserJock>                             simpler on individual PCs(no network)? (like Ubuntu Desktop)
20:04 <@LaserJock> yes
20:04 <@LaserJock> we have a Desktop CD
20:04 <@LaserJock> it works just the same as the Ubuntu Desktop CD
20:05 <@LaserJock> it just had the Edubuntu themeing and some educational applications
20:05 <@LaserJock> we couldn't stuff *all* of the edu apps so you won't get everything we have to offer
20:05 <@LaserJock> but the rest can be easily downloaded via metapackages
20:05 <@LaserJock> QUESTION: Do you find you are able to introduce Edubuntu in schools easily, or do schools restrict  themselves to Windows
20:05 <@LaserJock> it can be tough
20:06 <@LaserJock> it is definately an uphill battle
20:06 <@LaserJock> but well worth it
20:06 <@LaserJock> and there is growing success around the world
20:06 <@LaserJock> there are several individual schools that have converted to Edubuntu
20:07 <@LaserJock> being able to drop an Edubuntu LTSP into an exisiting Windows network seamlessly will be a big help
20:07 <@LaserJock> QUESTION: many of the edubuntu educational apps are external projects (i.e. not developed by canonical),  are there any efforts by canonical to improve these apps? especially ones that are great but  seem to be lacking progress?
20:07 <@LaserJock> I believe all the apps are external projects
20:08 <@LaserJock> we pretty much just try to pull it together and provide the needed glue
20:08 < shane_> QUESTION: have the team tried specifically to push for Edubuntu adoption esp in developing countries since it is obviously cheaper?
20:08 <@LaserJock> we have small apps here and there, Thin Client Manager, and I'm working on some cool menu stuff for the next release
20:09 <@LaserJock> shane_: sure
20:09 <@LaserJock> no licensing fees is always a motivator
20:09 <@LaserJock> QUESTION: What do you see as the biggest barrier for getting schools to use Edubuntu over any  other system?
20:09 < shane_> Question: and how has it been recieved esp with the younger children?
20:09 <@LaserJock> shane_: quite well
20:10 < shane_> :)
20:10 <@LaserJock> we have a thank you pic from a class full of kids somewhwere on edubuntu.org
20:11 <@LaserJock> one of the biggest barriers I see is getting around the mentatily that to produce useful citizens we must use tied to Microsoft products
20:11 < shane_> My mother has a kindergarten and would really like to move them over to Edubuntu... but the the games and other stuff they have under Windows is quite vast
20:11 <@LaserJock> you have administrators who are not technically adept making decisions
20:11 <@LaserJock> they have to see that a switch will be better for the children, and better for their school
20:12 <@LaserJock> QUESTION: Are there plans to ship the KDE4 education programs in  hardy?
20:12 <@LaserJock> well, I don't think so as default
20:12 <@LaserJock> we created for Gutsy a edubuntu-desktop-kde package that will help people who enjoy KDE
20:13 <@LaserJock> OK, wow
20:13 <@LaserJock> we chewed up our time
20:13 <@LaserJock> and there are a ton more questions
20:13 < shane_> QUESTION: are there any plans for introducing a simpler interface more akin to XO in Edubuntu?
20:13 <@LaserJock> I'm gonna stop now
20:14 <@LaserJock> and I would envite everybody to head over to #edubuntu
20:14 <@LaserJock> I'll try to answer some more questions there
20:14 < shane_> thanks
20:14 <@LaserJock> and introduce you all to the team
20:14 < popey> thanks LaserJock 
20:14 < BonesolTeraDyne> thanks LaserJock
20:14 <@LaserJock> Thanks for coming everybody!
20:14 <+stgraber> thanks LaserJock
20:14 < peppych> thanks LaserJock
20:14 < lieter> thank you LaserJock
