=== About Me ===

I came across my screenname as a childhood friend always called me Darren ever since I was little. He started adding the mysterious part because I was very quiet and liked to keep to myself to think. 
  
I've been using Ubuntu since I was given a CD with 7.10. I used straight Ubuntu with a few modifications till Lubuntu came into existence. I have proudly used it ever since.   

==== Socially ====

 
I have very little time other then attending classes, working full-time and being a member of several      clubs. I also practice Karate and train for distance races.  

==== Professionally ====

Currently I am a manager for a catering and restaurant company. I oversee students and deal with everything that comes with them. It is very stressful sometimes, but also very rewarding.  

=== Ubuntu Participation ===

Helping people by giving advice about a problem in IRC, and by helping through Ubuntuforums. I also have several Linux users in the community that I help regularly.  

==== Ubuntu Forums ====

At the moment, I tend to post rather erratically on the forums, but try to help out in the Absolute Beginners board whenever I think I have something useful to contribute. I've been on the forums since 2008.

==== Internet Relay Chat ====

My registered IRC nickname is mysteriousdarren.  I am looking forward to getting to know the Ubuntu community members better through this medium.  I am usually present in the following channels:

 {*}  #kubuntu 

 {*}  #kubuntu-offtopic 

 {*}  ##linux 

 {*}  #lubuntu 

 {*}  #lubuntu-offtopic 

 {*}  #ubuntu 

 {*}  #ubuntu-beginners   
    
 {*}  #ubuntuforums 

 {*}  #ubuntu-montana 

 {*}  #ubuntu-offtopic 

 {*}  #ubuntu-youth 

 {*}  #xubuntu 

 {*}  #xubuntu-offtopic 

=== Linux User Group (LUG) ===

I do not attend any LUG's currently, the current ones that I know of are a great distance away. I have a small group of friends that get together instead. 

=== Goals For The Future ===

1.  Continue to help beginners by posting in Ubuntuforums 
2.  Continue to assist on IRC.
3.  Help further the use of Ubuntu and Linux. 
4.  Eventual Ubuntu Membership.

=== Testimonials ===
