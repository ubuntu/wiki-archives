=== About Me ===

Hi, I'm a long-time Kubuntu user who has decided it is time to apply for membership.

I started using Unix on a PDP-11, and first used Linux as a live DVD with Ubuntu 8.04 LTS (Hardy Heron), and in VMs soon afterwards. I moved to Kubuntu after the 11.04 (Natty Narwhal) Unity debut, but realized that it was not KDE software that made Kubuntu special, but the way contributors were immediately made welcome.

=== Contributions ===

Marco is not just a long-time faithful and helpful part of the team, he's also there just when needed. In particular his making the release notes look good along with being factually correct has been really important. I'm very happy to see him apply for Kubuntu Membership.
