Apr 22 20:05:00 <Iowan>	20 20:20:20 2010
Apr 22 20:05:35 <AtomicSpark>	You're an odd one. :P
Apr 22 20:06:28 <Infl8ableSoulm8>	doesn't that mean it was posted at 20 20:20:02 2010?
Apr 22 20:06:33 <Infl8ableSoulm8>	close enough.
Apr 22 20:07:07 <Iowan>	Yes - 18 seconds later would have been... ?
Apr 22 20:08:18 <Infl8ableSoulm8>	yeah, but 02 is just 20 backwards, unless you are doing math
Apr 22 20:08:23 <Infl8ableSoulm8>	or bitwise stuff

Apr 22 20:37:46 <Iowan>	Yes you may... oh, sorry - that was a date.

Apr 22 20:38:37 *	AtomicSpark wonders off for a min
Apr 22 20:40:06 <Iowan>	food/beverage selection @library isn't great...
Apr 22 20:40:33 <Iowan>	CD's will end up as coasters @watering holes, though
