=== Summary ===

There are repeated threads on the forums and elsewhere about new users deleting their XP partitions by mistake. This shows we need more warnings when choosing the "Guided - Use entire disk" function.

=== Use cases ===

Martin wants to install ubuntu on his drive with windows xp. He chooses the default "use entire disk" function and unknowingly wipes entire windows partition

Matt's computer has compilicated partition structure, so the only option selectable on partitioning menu is "use entire disk". There is a custom button but Matt does not see that, or thinks installer knows the best and wipes the entire disk.

=== Scope ===

=== Design ===

 0. There should be a warning message associated with "Use entire disk" option that clearly notifies the user that he/she will be deleted all files and operating system that is on the disk.

=== Implementation ===
