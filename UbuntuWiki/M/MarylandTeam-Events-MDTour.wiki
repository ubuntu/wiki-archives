== Ubuntu Maryland Team State Tour ==

The Ubuntu Maryland team state tour is an idea to bring knowledge of Ubuntu, Linux and Free Software to different areas of the state. We want to try to average one visit a month. 

The particulars of each event will vary depending on location. However the general thrust of each event will be to have a meet and greet to start the time off with. This will be followed by a presentation then discussion. 

For more information or questions about this project please email us at <nowiki>[[mailto:mdtour@ubuntu-maryland.org|mdtour@ubuntu-maryland.org]]</nowiki>
