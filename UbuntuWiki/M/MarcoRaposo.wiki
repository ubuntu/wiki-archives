=== Brief presentation ===

'''Welcome'''! I am a computer technician from Portugal.

In a far past I had some academic experience with UNIX systems (DEC Ultrix 4.2(?) and Digital UNIX/OSF1), MacOS (System 5.x/6.x), MS-DOS/Windows (since 3.x/2.x).

I became acquainted with Ubuntu 6.10 (Edgy) in December 2006 during a course on Linux networking ministered by a teacher of the local university. After some testings, I have migrated in 2007 a small school LAN, about 450 users, from an expensive proprietary system to the open-source Ubuntu Linux (Desktop and Server versions).

At the time I did the installation and configuration of the 3 Dell PowerEdge servers in the network, the major difficulty was to implement the Directory Services: LDAP configuration is not user-friendly, neither in the <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OpenLDAPServer|server side]]</nowiki> nor in the <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LDAPClientAuthentication|clients side]]</nowiki>. My conclusion: Ubuntu is a very robust, user-friendly and outstanding Linux distribution but it lacks a manageable <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-directory|Directory Service]]</nowiki>, that is, there is need of such core service to be developed if Ubuntu is to became a 'standard' in small and medium networks.

Merry Christmas!
