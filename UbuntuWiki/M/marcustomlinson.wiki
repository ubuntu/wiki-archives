=== About Me ===

My name is Marcus Tomlinson. I'm a qualified BSc Software Engineer from Durban, South Africa, with well over a decade of experience in embedded and non-embedded software development. When I'm not writing software, I'm usually writing <nowiki>[[https://soundcloud.com/marcustomlinson|music]]</nowiki> or <nowiki>[[https://amazon.com/Marcus-Tomlinson/e/B01A3G4KAQ|books]]</nowiki>. Sometimes I may even write a <nowiki>[[http://amzn.com/B01A36ZI66|book about software]]</nowiki>, or <nowiki>[[https://github.com/thestk|software around music]]</nowiki>.

==== Highlights ====

===== Unity APIs =====

* Heavily involved in designing and developing Ubuntu’s Unity Shell features and APIs from 2013 to 2017 (as you can tell from the list above).
* Co-created (w/ Michi Henning) the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/unity-scopes-api|middleware layer and API behind Scopes]]</nowiki>.
* Created a C++-to-JS binding library called: "<nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/v8-cpp|V8-cpp]]</nowiki>", to provide JavaScript APIs for the team's many C++ APIs.
* Recognised as Technical Lead for my considerable contribution to Scopes and broad experience across much of the Unity API suite.
* <nowiki>[[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyE0oUN-fxVfTXdYlGzOck68CS5WmLNTr|Presented at a number of Ubuntu Online Summits]]</nowiki>.

===== Ubuntu Desktop =====

* Improved desktop-launch (<nowiki>[[https://github.com/ubuntu/snapcraft-desktop-helpers|snapcraft-desktop-helpers]]</nowiki>) cold run time by 20%-30%.
* Developed the first set of GNOME <nowiki>[[https://snapcraft.io/gnome-3-32-1804-sdk|build-]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[https://snapcraft.io/gnome-3-32-1804|platform-snaps]]</nowiki>, aimed at greatly simplifying GNOME-based snap packaging.
* Took over maintenance of the LibreOffice Ubuntu packages (<nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libreoffice|deb]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[https://snapcraft.io/libreoffice|snap]]</nowiki>) in early-2019.
* <nowiki>[[https://bit.ly/33BrMYS|Reduced the backlog of LibreOffice bugs from > 800 to < 400]]</nowiki> in the first 6 months by staying on top of triaging, releases, SRUs, and CVEs.
* <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libreoffice/+bug/1791943|Merged the libreoffice-l10n meta package into libreoffice]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[https://packages.ubuntu.com/eoan/libreoffice-help-common|introduced libreoffice-help-common]]</nowiki>.
* Reduced the overall size of the <nowiki>[[https://snapcraft.io/libreoffice|LibreOffice snap]]</nowiki> by ~20%, and its cold run time by ~45%.

==== Future Goals ====

* Continue to develop my experience with a wide range of technologies and domains.
* Find opportunities to work with different languages, on different projects, and at different layers.

==== pstolowski ====

I worked with Marcus on Unity API and Unity Scopes for a few years and he contributed a lot to the project. He is a great software engineer, highly skilled, versatile and passionate about all aspects of software development. He is a good and dependable team player, very honest, open and easy going, working with him was a pleasure!

==== mdeslaur ====

Marcus has been preparing the LibreOffice security updates that I release for a while now. They are always well done, well prepared, and well tested. He is attentive to detail and an excellent engineer. I wholeheartedly recommend Marcus gain LibreOffice PPU rights.

==== jamesh ====

I have worked with Marcus on both the Unity API Team and the Ubuntu Desktop Team.  He is an excellent software engineer with strong C++ skills, and an attention to software quality.  On the Unity API Team, all team members  were responsible for maintaining the Debian packaging of the software we developed, and Marcus had no trouble here.  On the Desktop team, Marcus has been doing great work maintaining the LibreOffice packages (no small feat), and has quickly mastered snap packaging.

==== osomon ====

After two years maintaining the libreoffice packages and snap in Ubuntu, I passed the torch to Marcus in April this year, and he has been doing a great job of understanding all the intricacies of the packaging and preparing updates for all supported Ubuntu releases in a timely manner. His updates are always well prepared and carefully tested, he responds to bug reports promptly and responsibly, and on top of that he has done a lot of triaging to clear the backlog of untriaged bugs in Launchpad.
I strongly support his application for LibreOffice PPU rights, and until then I'll happily continue sponsoring his uploads.
I also think the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopers#ContribDev|Ubuntu Contributing Developer]]</nowiki> role fits very well with Marcus's skills and proven track record.
