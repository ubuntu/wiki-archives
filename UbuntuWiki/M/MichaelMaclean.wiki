=== About ===

I'm a software developer based on the Isle of Lewis in Scotland. Most of my open source work thus far has revolved around PHP - I am a developer on a couple of PHP extensions for <nowiki>[[http://pecl.php.net/package/cairo|Cairo]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[http://pecl.php.net/package/rsvg|RSVG]]</nowiki>, among others, and I occasionally do work for the PHP documentation team.

I'm currently learning Scottish Gaelic and hoping to help out on the Scottish Gaelic translation for Ubuntu. I am also normally present in the #ubuntu-uk IRC channel and offer help there whenever I can.

=== Intentions ===

* To learn about packaging and get the PHP packages I work on into Ubuntu and Debian
* I have been intending to contribute to the GNOME project for many years, and as yet have not found a way in - I would really like to achieve this
* To become more active in the Ubuntu community
* To run for Ubuntu membership
