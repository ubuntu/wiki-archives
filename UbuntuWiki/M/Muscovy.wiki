=== About Me ===

My name is Alexandra Lancey. I am a programmer by night, and a student by day.

After a friend introduced me to Ubuntu, I started making a remix for friends and family called AlexandOS (capital 'OS' is not phonetic). It's been a fun gateway to learning all sorts of things, from Python to vector graphics to website design.

==== Bug Squad ====
I am a member of the Ubuntu Bugsquad. When I gain more experience, I hope to move up the the Bug Control team.

==== Ubuntu Manual ====
I joined the <nowiki>[[http://ubuntu-manual.org | Ubuntu Manual]]</nowiki> project a few weeks before the Lucid e2 release, and became an editor. I have written new content during the development of the Maverick manual, and intend to edit as well.

* Help the Ubuntu Tour become a default application.
* Become a MOTU member.
* Join the Ubuntu members group.
* Work at Canonical!

If you know me and have something nice to say, please leave a comment here. :D

Alexander is a very nice person, he is also a skilled programmer, who is dedicated to his projects. Ubuntu-Tour is one of them and that is going really well. Any other project and team is lucky to have him. Thanks! -- <nowiki>[[UndiFineD|UndiFineD]]</nowiki> 2010/12/15
