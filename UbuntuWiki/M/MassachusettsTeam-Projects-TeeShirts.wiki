== Ubuntu T-shirts ==

Ubuntu t-shirts are designed to show off our support for the ubuntu operating system without misdirecting the marketing by showing Massachusetts Logos or specific branding. We hope that not only will this allow us to either buy pre-made t-shirts from other sources but also allow people from outside of this state to acquire some of the same kinds of t-shirts for their own teams or use.

The rationale for ubuntu only designs was an important consideration when looking into the best businesses to get t-shirts made; if you would like to participate in this project, please add details here.

We are ordering 24 this first round. When we get more members or get more requests for t-shirt, we will put in bigger orders. To cover the costs of this first order, the total charge per t-shirt is going to be $15. If want to help out even further, feel free to pay up to $20. This will help cover the up front cost even further. Any proceeds after this will be put toward the group budget used for group events. 

=== Pledge Support ===

If you're in a group and want to help us get the very best price we can you can put your name and conditions down here:

People will have to pay a $15 to cover set-up fee and postage, so as not to bankrupt ubuntu-us-ma.

=== Variations ===

There is currently no plan to produce Kubuntu, Xubuntu or other variations because of the demand for these variations would cost a lot of money.
