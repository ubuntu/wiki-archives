 (04:23:49 PM) ausimage: Lets hold a mini meeting now .... 
(04:24:29 PM) ausimage: The only topics I can see that need discussion are Team Communication and Raise use and interest
(04:24:56 PM) beuno: right, what's on your mind for team communication?
(04:25:02 PM) beuno: (I'm a bit out of the loop)
(04:25:07 PM) ausimage: We NEED a list 
(04:25:29 PM) ausimage: that is public for people to ask for help and get help....
(04:26:05 PM) ausimage: I am not always focused on the channel... or am away from the computer....
(04:26:31 PM) ausimage: and I have noticed people pop in... and then leave...
(04:26:34 PM) beuno: why don't you have one?
(04:27:17 PM) ausimage: no there is a not a list for Scribes, yet... Seeker` asked for one in Feb or Mar...\
(04:27:34 PM) ausimage: I tried to follow up with no response either....
(04:27:49 PM) beuno: ausimage: you should ask jono
(04:27:56 PM) beuno: he's managing requests now
(04:28:04 PM) ausimage: K I will ping him then....
(04:28:37 PM) ausimage: All I know... is that list would be helpful at this point
(04:29:15 PM) ausimage: perhaps if we get the list I can point everyone to the list instead of the channel...
(04:29:54 PM) beuno: yes, the list is very useful
(04:29:58 PM) ausimage: unless there other ideas on getting to those who drop in....
(04:30:25 PM) beuno: the list is needed no matter what
(04:30:49 PM) beuno: probably chanserv giving people a quick link to the wiki when they come in the channel would help
(04:31:01 PM) ausimage: K... jono is on my to do list...
(04:31:09 PM) ausimage: how is that done?
(04:32:01 PM) beuno: you'd have to ask in #ubuntu-ops
(04:32:05 PM) beuno: I'm not sure of the commands
(04:32:31 PM) ausimage: K...
(04:33:20 PM) beuno: that might help a bit
(04:33:21 PM) ausimage: On Interest and use...
(04:33:42 PM) ausimage: I am open to whatever can be suggested to help...
(04:34:54 PM) ausimage: I have been keeping up with the major IRC meetings... but I know many are slipping through or are obscured 
(04:35:14 PM) beuno: I think people need to be aware this team exists
(04:35:21 PM) beuno: we should blog about it in the planet
(04:35:23 PM) beuno: add it to UWN
(04:35:33 PM) ausimage: Some do not seem to understand the need for a meeting directory
(04:35:36 PM) beuno: start hammering mailing lists for people to coordinate with us
(04:36:29 PM) ausimage: K... I will look over the lists... after I get our list going....
(04:36:53 PM) ausimage: that way all communication can through that rather than just me
(04:37:26 PM) ausimage: I also think I need to bring the idea I shared with you the other day...
(04:38:01 PM) ausimage: getting CC to endorse.... through a non-binding resolution or something....
(04:38:17 PM) beuno: yeap, you should probably discuss that with jono too
(04:38:22 PM) beuno: he can give you some guidance
(04:38:39 PM) ausimage: lots of things to discuss with jono...
(04:38:59 PM) ausimage: perhaps an article in UWN as well ??
(04:39:20 PM) beuno: yeap, you can count on that
(04:39:34 PM) beuno: you can even do it yourself under the Community Spotlight section
(04:39:34 PM) ausimage: or perhaps just do a short interview on my Scribes duties and such ??? :)
(04:40:48 PM) ausimage: anything else that can help us?
(04:41:17 PM) beuno: lemme give it some more thought
(04:41:24 PM) beuno: but bloggin and UWN seems like a good start
(04:41:37 PM) ausimage: sure.... yeah...
(04:41:50 PM) ausimage: We need more use and more help...
(04:43:04 PM) ausimage: K if there is not much else... I will consider the topics discussed...
