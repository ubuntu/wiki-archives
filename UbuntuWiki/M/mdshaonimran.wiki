I have written few installation guides for Eucalyptus on Ubuntu. Those are available here http://mdshaonimran.wordpress.com. I made a complete Eucalyptus installation video which is now available on EucaTV. I have also written another easy installation script which works on Ubuntu Oneiric. http://mdshaonimran.github.com/eucastart
