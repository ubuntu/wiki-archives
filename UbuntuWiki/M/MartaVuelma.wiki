=== About me ===
<nowiki>[[File:MartaP2.png]]</nowiki>
<<BR>>
My first contact with free software was in 2001 and I started using Ubuntu in 2005. After knowing this amazing system in 2010 I decided to get involved with the community. Since this date I have dedicated myself in various ways for the user community: attending events, giving lectures, courses, disseminating the philosophy of Ubuntu and bringing in new members.<<BR>>
In early 2012, after attending events representing or assisting the Ubuntu-BR I was chosen as leader of the Ubuntu-BR-RS LoCo Team. Since this date I have worked to promote events of Ubuntu and improve visibility and participation of the group in the country. Also I reported bugs in Lauchpad and have helped users through the Mailing Lists.<<BR>>
I think Ubuntu is an incredible way to share knowledge and bring people together through an ideal. Because of this, I want to continue contributing to the community in the best way possible.

=== Testimonials ===

Marta is a very active member of the Ubuntu Brazilian community, a great writer and leader of a big LoCo Team too. I'm really happy to know that she is trying the Ubuntu membership, cause she deserve it. As one of the leaders at the Ubuntu-BR-SC's blog/LoCo Team and an Ubuntu member, I'm 100% in favor of her membership. <nowiki>[[julianfernandes|Julian Fernandes]]</nowiki><<BR>><<BR>>

Marta is definitely a great addition to our community. She has a proven record of contributions on major Open Source events here in Brazil, doing the booth duty, answering new users questions and helping the community as a whole. She does have my endorsement to become a Ubuntu member <nowiki>[[DudaNogueira|Duda Nogueira]]</nowiki> - Former Ubuntu Membership Board Member, Ubuntu Member, Latinoware Coordinator, Duda Library Founder<<BR>><<BR>>

I strongly support her. We need her knowledge, leadership, experience with people and events.
