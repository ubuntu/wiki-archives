;Ubuntu is an African concept of 'humanity towards others'. It is 'the belief in a universal bond of sharing that connects all humanity'. 
''That says it all - if that was the ruling ideal none of the following would need be elaborated.''
The same ideas are central to the way the Ubuntu community collaborates. We chose the name Ubuntu for our distribution because we think it captures perfectly the spirit of the sharing and cooperation that is at the heart of the open source movement."
''it's a '''movement'''''

== Leadership outline ==
Member goals
* happy
* productive
* agile 
* Bug#1 solvers

We are a group of '''volunteers''', this is not a paying job(for most of us.) 
Leadership can be defined as one's ability to get others to willingly follow. Every organization needs leaders at every level.
== LoCoTeamLeader ==

=== Local Community team leadership ===

'''Note:''' A new <nowiki>[[LeadershipCodeofConduct| Leadership Code of Conduct]]</nowiki> has been put together and approved at the Community Council. The following information may soon be removed completely and is kept while transitioning to the new Leadership Code of Conduct.''Much of this may be moot because of this.''

There are two meanings of the term '''leader'''. One is ''tell others what to do'', the other is ''others follow you because you set a good example''. The first concept does not work well in any volunteer organization, and Ubuntu Local Teams are no exception.

The Ubuntu community cannot, and does not want to be babysitters.

A local community team leader should ...

* Be active in and part of the community or group that they are representing.  They should be visible and accessible.
* Lead by example, not by telling others what to do.
* eventually, become an Ubuntu Member. See <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/community/processes/newmember|here]]</nowiki> for details.
* Remind people of the <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntulinux.org/community/conduct|Ubuntu Code of Conduct]]</nowiki>, if necessary. It's important that the level of respect in Ubuntu stretches to all Ubuntu communities.
* Leaders should be reasonably impartial about political or cultural conflict. Try to reflect Ubuntu's apolitical stance and don't confuse the issues.
* Finally, a leader should step down gracefully if he or she is no longer able to be a good community team leader. There is no shame and no harm in being too busy to do the job well, but there is in being too busy, not saying anything, and blocking the work of an entire group.

Collaboration for '''everyone's''' benefit.

* Personal responsibility      
* Community responsibility   
* If there is a widespread difference in opinion have a vote to gauge everyone's thoughts and try to come to a solution to the problem. If a decision is made, decide on some action steps to implement to resolve the issue and ensure people are assigned those action steps.    

The rules apply everywhere
Ubuntu governance bodies are ultimately accountable to the Ubuntu Community Council and will arbitrate in any dispute over the conduct of a member of the community.

* Be considerate. Our actions affectt others.
* Be respectful. Everyone has value in Ubuntu. There is no excuse for being an ass. Don't make it personal. People need to feel comfortable. This is expected in '''all''' dealings within the Ubuntu community as well as with people outside the Ubuntu project.
== Resolving LoCo Problems ==
privately, 
then publicly, 

We ''always'' recommend that you try to resolve issues directly with the people who you believe to be problematic.Ensure diplomacy and try to solve the core issues. Always attempting to make progress. Remember, solving problems is about negotiation and reasoning - both sides will need to make compromises.

* You may want to schedule an IRC meeting to discuss the issues. Do this at a time that is suitable for the majority of group members and certainly those involved in the issue - ensure that a good cross section of the group can attend. 

If the problem cannot be resolved privately, it needs to be discussed publicly. You should only ever discuss issues publicly if the issue is suitable for public discussion. ''Never'' discuss issues publicly about sensitive or private information.Mailing list discussions are typically '''preferred''' over IRC conversations as more people can access mailing lists than IRC.

==== Disagreements ====
we consult others. 
It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views '''constructively'''. With the help of the community and 
=== community processes ===
Disagreements are generally of 2 types-
===== Social =====
Ubuntu Community Council
==== Technical ==== 
On technical matters, the Technical Review Board can make a final decision.

*** When we are unsure, we ask for help. Nobody know everything, or is perfect. Asking questions is good. It can help avoid problems.  ''Ask'' in the appropriate forum.Those who are asked questions should be responsive and helpful.

The rules apply everywhere
Ubuntu governance bodies are ultimately accountable to the Ubuntu Community Council and will arbitrate in any dispute over the conduct of a member of the community.

We hold our leaders to an even higher standard, in the Leadership Code of Conduct, and arrange the governance of the community to ensure that issues can be raised with leaders who are engaged, interested and competent to help resolve them.

* Step down considerately. Know when it is time.

----------------------------

Collaboration for everyone's benefit. We improve on the work of others, which we have been given freely, and then share our improvements on the same basis.

      Be collaborative. Collaboration is central. This collaboration involves individuals working with others in teams within Ubuntu, teams working with each other within Ubuntu, and individuals and teams within Ubuntu working with other projects outside. This collaboration reduces redundancy, and improves the quality of our work. Internally and externally, we should always be open to collaboration. Wherever possible, we should work closely with upstream projects and others in the free software community to coordinate our technical, advocacy, documentation, and other work. Our work should be done transparently and we should involve as many interested parties as early as possible. If we decide to take a different approach than others, we will let them know early, document our work and inform others regularly of our progress.

We encourage the creation of alternative sets of packages, or derivative distributions, using the Ubuntu Package Management framework, so that the community can test new ideas and contribute to the discussion.
