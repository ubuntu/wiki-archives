== Main Inclusion Report for partman-iscsi ==

=== Requirements ===

# ''Availability:'' <nowiki>[[http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/p/partman-iscsi]]</nowiki>; available for all supported architectures (in binary NEW at time of writing)
# ''Rationale:''
** Implements partitioning changes designed in UbuntuSpec:foundations-karmic-iscsi-installer-support.
** Expected to be used in server/netboot installations (i.e. on the server CD, and Priority: standard).
0. ''Security:''
** New package, so no CVE/Secunia history.
** Runs as root as part of the installer.
** Talks to iSCSI portals using iscsiadm.
** No direct processing of binary data.
** Source code review performed by virtue of the fact that I (ColinWatson) wrote this package :-)
0. ''Quality assurance:''
** Adds a "Configure iSCSI" item to the partitioning menu when installed; if that item is selected then it asks several critical-priority debconf questions. However, this package does not add any questions to the default installation path.
** Not (yet?) in Debian.
** No independent upstream existence.
** In production this package would normally cooperate with a genuine hardware iSCSI server, although it's possible to emulate that using the iscsitarget package (and that's what I used to write this).
** No test suite.
0. ''UI standards:''
** User-visible strings are internationalised using po-debconf, following standard practice in the installer.
0. ''Standards compliance:'' 
** Meets usual standards for installer package layout, although these are not directly beholden to the FHS or Debian Policy.
** Native debhelper 7 packaging.
0. ''Dependencies:''
** Only non-trivial dependency is open-iscsi-udeb, already in main.
0. ''Maintenance:''
** Some ongoing development is expected to polish up the UI; for example, we still need to add support for authenticated targets. Since this is a Karmic feature goal, effort will be available for this. Once feature development settles down it should need only about as much maintenance as the rest of partman.
** The submitter of this report (ColinWatson) is responsible for fixing bugs, and the ubuntu-installer team (which includes me) is the package bug contact.
