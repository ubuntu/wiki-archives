== Main Inclusion Report for boo ==
=== Requirements ===
   1. Availability: http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/b/boo/  available for all arches
   2. Rationale: new (optional) depedency of monodevelop which is already in main. This enables language support for boo in monodevelop
   3. Security: No security isses reported (but package is still pretty young).
   4. Quality assurance:
****** The package contains a compiler and shell for the boo language which can be used right out the box with no additional efforts required
****** Maintained by Sam Clegg <samo@debian.org> in Debian
****** One important outstanding Debian Bug <nowiki>[[http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=317710|#317710]]</nowiki> which I solved for Universe... I've contacted Sam Clegg to fix it, too
****** Lots of open major bugs in <nowiki>[[http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/BOO|upstream bug tracker]]</nowiki>, some of them open for more than half a year.
   5. Standards compliance:
****** The package meets the FHS, Debian Policy and CLIPolicy
   6. Dependencies:
****** Only depends on mono which is in main already

=== Reviewers ===

MartinPitt: software is still very young and has many bugs, IMHO a new programming language should mature a bit before we officially support it; however, it is okay security-wise. I'd like to get a second opinion on that.
