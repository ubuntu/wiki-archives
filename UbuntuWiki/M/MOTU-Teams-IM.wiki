Welcome to the MOTU Instant Messaging team. We are always looking for new members. Come to #ubuntu-motu on freenode if you want to join or help out.

=== Purpose of this Team ===
In despite of a nice environment for Instant Messaging Services like Jabber or also Groupware Integrated Services, we want to start to collect some good software and provide a structure for it for Ubuntu.

=== Goals ===

 1. Create a IM Platform, base for this will be the standard implementation of a XMPP Server, named <nowiki>[[http://www.jabber.org/|jabberd2]]</nowiki> or <nowiki>[[http://ejabberd.jabber.ru/|ejabberd]]</nowiki>
 2. Provide packages for several jabber/xmpp components, which are running together with jabberd2
 3. Integration of Jabber and VOIP (links are following)
 4. Regular updates to IM Clients like PSI, Kopete, tkabber, gaim, gajim
 5. Solutions for integrating jabber in groupware solutions (hula, kolab2)
