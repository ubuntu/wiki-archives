History
Started using Linux in 1997... Using Red Hat and had it was the first time i've encontered the Dependecy hell (rpm) it was a pain to configure and install programs back then :(

Then I tried Debian and the apt system and i've felt in love, used debian for all my desktops and servers, also i've used slackware in some of my servers.

When I read in distrowatch that a new linux distribution based in gnome was starting, i've felt imediatly interesed in it...and start using ubuntu from Warty, then Hoary and now Breezy.
