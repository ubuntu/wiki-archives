=== Additional Information ===
A global effort to teach the advantages of free software, Software Freedom Day will help you learn how it can work for you. Join the Ubuntu Maryland Local Community Team, Howard County Library, and others for fun and festivities. In addition to helping you install Ubuntu Linux (proudly used on many library PCs) to your PC, we will demonstrate and discuss free software. Some "gently used" computers will be available for sale ($50.00) for Ubuntu installation.
