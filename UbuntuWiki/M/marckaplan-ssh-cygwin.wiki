Cygwin is a unix-like environment for Windows.  You can download it here: <nowiki>[[http://www.cygwin.com/|Cygwin]]</nowiki>

To install it run the ''Setup.exe'' and choose a server.

To use ssh, you need to install the openssh package (it includes BOTH a server and client). It is located under "Net" and is called ''openssh''.
