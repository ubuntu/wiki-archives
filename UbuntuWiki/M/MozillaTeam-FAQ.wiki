Welcome to the <nowiki>[[MozillaTeam|Mozilla Team]]</nowiki> FAQ! The aim of this page is to provide an up to date list of common questions that we get about the <nowiki>[[MozillaTeam|Mozilla Team]]</nowiki> project. We encourage you to update this document when something is missing so it becomes a core source of information for the project.

== General Questions ==

=== What happens when Firefox 1.5 stops being updated upstream? ===

Please see <nowiki>[[http://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperFirefoxSupport|this page]]</nowiki>.

=== What is Ubuntu's stance on the use of Mozilla's trademarks? ===

'''Please do not edit!'''

The Mozilla Corp. has decided to protect their trademark and to request that it be used only in ways which meet with their approval. We agree that they are perfectly entitled to do this.

Ubuntu and Mozilla came to the agreement that Ubuntu would continue to use the Mozilla Trademarks.  In exchange for using the official Mozilla trademarks, Ubuntu developers will work in cooperation with Mozilla developers to insure that we meet Mozilla's quality requirements.

This differs from our direct upstream parents, Debian, who decided to rename the application to IceWeasel, creating the Imagery and Name themselves.

This page has been outlined from discussion made on the <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/|ubuntu-devel]]</nowiki> mailing list, please see the October 2006 archives for more information.
