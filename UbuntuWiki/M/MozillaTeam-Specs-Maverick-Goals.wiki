=== Scheduling ===
We should have current stable, and possibly RC in Maverick
 - a late beta may be possible Hardy style, though Maverick isn't an LTS
 - this means Firefox 4, due in October

Firefox 3.6 and Thunderbird 3.0 going to Hardy and Jaunty as old stable gets EOLed
XULRunner as well

=== Desires ===
* Translation worries for XULRunner updates to Hardy
   - Contact Arne Goetje before release to make sure the translations still work
* Proper Multiarch packaging for Flash 32 bit dependencies
* Performance
   - enable profile-guided-optimization in Mozilla packages
   - use performance metrics from QA team
   - Get fast enough to be default in Unity
* Mail-indicator working correct in Thunderbird (https://launchpad.net/libnotify-mozilla)
   - Notifications possibly but probably not as it was pushed to 3.2
* Firefox notification
   - notify-osd should inform when a download completes (consistent with Transmission)
   - Firefox-notify extension (currently broken?)
* provide plugin build/install assistance
   - https://bugs.launchpad.net/mozilla-devscripts/+bug/516350
* A category for XUL extensions in software center? (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DesktopTeam/Specs/Lucid/FirefoxNewSupportModel/extension-list)
   - do an audit of mozilla packages and their extensions and their places in software center
     - sometime around beta
     - Scott Ritchie
     
=== Work items ===
* Thunderbird Stable PPA: micahg
* Add Provides: Iceweasel to package control file: Chris Coulson
* Improve Firefox ubuntu wiki pages: micahg
* Edit testing wiki page to mention firefox test suite stuff: Scott Ritchie
   - goal is to have someone running daily firefox ppa use the test suite on it every update
* Ask Mozilla about translation permissions: Chris Coulson
   - Can we modify existing strings?
   - Can we add translations for untranslated strings? 
   - email answer to ubuntu-translation-coordinators team
   - If no we can give up on translating in launchpad.
* OpenJDK backport for karmic (PPA) (gotunandan on identi.ca to help with karmic QA)

==== Chat w/CCheney about dictionaries ====
[2010-05-06 micahg]
Possibility of having firefox/abrowser providing iceweasel -- reduces number of merges
Fix multiple dictionaries issue:
(09:57:25 PM) micahg: ccheney: should we have a session on dictionaries or can I roll it into the mozilla generic session or neither?
(09:57:37 PM) ccheney: micahg: as i understand it rene is planning on dropping the backwards compat symlinks altogether soon in Debian
(09:57:46 PM) ccheney: micahg: enchant still hasn't been ported to use the new dir on Ubuntu
(09:57:52 PM) micahg: ccheney: ok, so we don't need anything specific?
(09:58:15 PM) ccheney: micahg: probably not, we just need to make sure someone makes certain to get all the dictionaries updated in this cycle and prod Rene to drop the backwards compat asap
(09:58:31 PM) ccheney: micahg: that way we don't have to maintain a delta to drop the compat bits
(09:58:54 PM) micahg: ccheney: would it be ok if I add that to the mozilla generic work tasks?
(09:59:09 PM) ccheney: micahg: sounds ok to me assuming no one else has objections :)
(10:00:06 PM) ccheney: everything needs to be in hunspell as xx_YY (iirc) and nothing under myspell once backwards compat is dropped
(10:00:37 PM) ccheney: i assume rene will probably update the policy to reflect that once he is ready to do it
(10:00:58 PM) ccheney: dropping xx-YY should be doable at any time though afaik
