=== What? ===

Paste this script one paragraph at a time in the channel. Be sure to update the <DATE>.

=== Intro ===

Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board meeting for <DATE>. The wiki page for the Review Boards is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards

We will attempt to get through all the applicants that have added themselves to that list, or posted a thread to the Ubuntu Discourse, before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the complete list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.

The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).

Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page or Ubuntu Discourse thread. After the introduction, the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.

During this time, it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.

When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If most of the voting board members vote +1, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (Feel free congratulate them!)

Now, with any further ado, let's get started with the first applicant...
