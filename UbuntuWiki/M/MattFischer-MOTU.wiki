__TOC__

This page hold my notes, to do items, and done items as part of the process of becoming a MOTU.

=== To Do ===

* SRU
* backports
* <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MOTU/TODO|everything else]]</nowiki>

=== Notes ===

* UDD process
** Finding Out of date packages: 
** http://people.canonical.com/~platform/ubuntu-desktop/
** qa.ubuntuwire.org/mdt/universe.html#outdatedandlocalinB
** File a Bug:
** add the tag upgrade-software-version
** subscribe Ubuntu-Sponsors if it's not a desktop package (after work is done)
** Check debian to see what version they're using, prefer to sync or from debian.
** Get the code
** UDD
*** bzr branch ubuntu:sonic
*** cd sonic
** Alternative method - some Desktop branches just have the debian folder checked in, <nowiki>[[https://code.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-desktop/yelp/ubuntu|for example, Yelp]]</nowiki>
*** debcheckout <source>
** Merge
** Upsream Merge
*** bzr merge-upstream --version X.Y <path to tarball>
*** download upstream tarball if needed
** Debian Merge
*** bzr merge lp:debian/experimental/simplejson
*** If merging from unstable, check <nowiki>[[https://merges.ubuntu.com/main.html|merge-o-matic]]</nowiki> and use grab-merge.
*** If there are no more Ubuntu changes, do a <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SyncRequestProcess|sync request]]</nowiki> instead
** dch -i
** set distoseries
** add bug number to the LP bug filed for the upgrade
** Build
** bzr-builddeb --split to create the .orig.tar.gz
** Things to check after the merge
** check the ChangeLog/NEWS to see if patches were applied upstream
** See what Launchpad bugs it closes
** apply all quilt packages if applicable
*** quilt refresh if there is fuzz
*** quilt push -f if there are rejects, manually fix, and then refresh
*** remove old patches: these may need to be bzr committed or it may complain about missing patches
*** you may need to bzr add or remove files in the .pc directory
** For upstream merges
*** check NEWS file (gnome) and add entries to changelog
*** check configure.ac and look for new dependencies or version changes on dependencies
** bzr-buildpackage --package-merge (package-merge generates the appropriate -v tag which is needed to highlight what changes came in this version)
** bzr-buildpackage -S --package-merge (source)
** If you want to pbuild the package:
** bzr-buildpackage -S --package-merge
** cd ../build-area
** pbuild
** If there are Ubuntu changes and the previous version was just synced from debian, run update-maintainer, it will change the maintainer and original-maintainer to Ubuntu.

* Misc Notes
** Debian Package hardening: http://wiki.debian.org/HardeningWalkthrough
** Seeing who made a sync request, look at <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pycode-browser/+publishinghistory|publishing history]]</nowiki>. 
** <nowiki>[[MOTU Notes|https:--wiki.ubuntu.com-MOTU-New]]</nowiki>
** dput will go to -proposed and will be migrated later
** The LP branch will be updated after the dput automagically
** If there is a new upstream (or a new upstream in Debian) you rebuild the upstream with -sa.
** Skipping tests during debbuild (for hacking): DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=nocheck
