I'm really kind of new to the whole "creation&formatting" side of the Wiki deal; I understand it's actually quite easy, but the few hours I have each day that are not spent with my family or working, I tend to be on Launchpad translating Ubuntu into Italian.  I was born of Italian mother and Irish/American father, and have spent several years both in Italy and in the USA.  What it basically means is that I speak, read and write natively in both languages, which I guess would be the main reason I work as a Translator/Interpreter :-P .
