== Main inclusion report for irda-utils ==

=== Requirements ===

1. ''Availability:'' http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/i/irda-utils

2. ''Rationale:'' This package is required in order to autoconfigure infra red ports on laptops that have them

3. ''Security:'' No known security issues. Requirement for user to have read/write access to the serial port used in order for mobile phone access to be possible.

4. ''QA:'' This tool merely provides userspace support tools - drivers are in the kernel already. Autoconfiguration will occur on laptops that claim to have internal IR hardware.

5. ''Standards compliance:'' Debhelpered package, appears to meet FHS and policy

6. ''Dependencies:'' Setserial (for serial port setup)
