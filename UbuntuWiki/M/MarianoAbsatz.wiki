Using ubuntu at my home PC since 2006 (the DapperDrake)... and <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~el-baby/+codesofconduct|ubuntero]]</nowiki> ever since.

I hang out at <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/member.php?u=118178|the forums]]</nowiki> and I'm a recent member of the <nowiki>[[http://ubuntu-ar.org/|Argentina LoCo Team]]</nowiki>.

Also at <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~el-baby|launchpad]]</nowiki>, but mostly reporting and commenting bugs, rather than solving them :-(

More about me in my <nowiki>[[http://www.linkedin.com/in/absatz|{{http://www.linkedin.com/img/webpromo/btn_liprofile_blue_80x15.gif|LinkedIn profile}}]]</nowiki>

=== my ubuntus ===

I upgraded my old DapperDrake to the HardyHeron <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HardyUpgrades#Upgrade%20from%206.06%20LTS%20to%208.04%20LTS|in just one step]]</nowiki> :-) (I didn't dare to upgrade to Edgy since there were quite a few problems at the time and I liked the '''LTS''' label of Dapper... thankfully, by the time Hardy hit the net, the lts2lts upgrade path became a reality.

Later, I installed the FeistyFawn in my office PC, which I kept upgrading seamlessly to the GutsyGibbon and then the HardyHeron.

Since the company I'm now in can't still afford a dedicated sysadmin, I've been responsible for installing our 4 servers:

The public mail server is remotely hosted in <nowiki>[[http://slicehost.com|Slicehost]]</nowiki>... at the time I set it up, I had to install a small DapperDrake image and upgrade it thru EdgyEft to FeistyFawn. Later on, I upgraded it (always remotely, since it's the only way) to the GutsyGibbon... I just upgraded it to HardyHeron without any problem.

I installed an internal but accessible server with apache, MoinMoin, Bugzilla and subversion on a very old PC (AMD Duron 1.2MHz/256Mb RAM) with FeistyFawn, later upgraded to EdgyEft and recently to the HardyHeron <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/269799|with minor glitches]]</nowiki>.

Finally, our firewall/dhcp server is a quad-ethernet PC where I installed the GutsyGibbon and just upgraded (without a hitch) to HardyHeron.

The same for our internal samba server (about 40 secs downtime during the only reboot).

I just installed HardyHeron on a new PC I'm using at work.
