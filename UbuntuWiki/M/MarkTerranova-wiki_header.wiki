__TOC__

The Team header has three links that point to one page. I suggest that the redundant link under *Contact us* be changed to webchat.freenode.net . 

<nowiki>[[File:Wiki.png]]</nowiki>

The exact details could be decided by the team. My suggestions would be;

{*}http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=ubuntu-us-ca

{*}Naming it direct link or webchat or direct-line. Something that denotes direct connection.
