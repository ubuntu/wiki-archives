=== Summary ===

It would be nice to have some sort of dictionary for Rosetta helping translator in their work.

This is usefull for translating the same term used in the desktop for all the application.

Best of all would be a sort of wikitionary-glossary for each language and open to the community. Rosetta would have a web service that take the word to translate and search in the wikitionary-glossary.

=== Use cases ===

Marco is translating the last killing app for Ubuntu into Italian. He find the term "bookmark" to translate. He doesn't remember how is translated or which is the translation approved from the team.
He uses the rosetta-dictionary-glossary specific for his language and find the term "segnalibro".
