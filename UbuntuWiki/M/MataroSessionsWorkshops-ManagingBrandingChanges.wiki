__TOC__

== Branding: (hoary+1 goal) ==

=== Goal ===

* brand any distro/derivate completely

=== What needs to be done ===

* exchange text, images in applications, configuration-files
* documentation changes
* code changes (d-i, vim)
* infrastructure change (bug tracking system, live CD, install CD, archive)
  
=== Proposals/Ideas ===

* use Replace on hundreds of packages
* use Divert on hundreds of packages
* change hundreds of source packages (patch it or use hct with tagged branches)
* use gettext (and push the problem to rosetta)
* make a general branding framework (make each package brandable and provide branding packages)

=== proposed solution ===

* parameterized source packages change + buildd (dh_brand) and a environment variable include file replacement
* have one $distro-branding and one $distro-artwork package

=== Problems ===

* we'll get fuzzy translations because of the branding changes (rosetta needs to optimize for it)
* some dispute about what parts of the branding need to be done at run-time and what at build-time

=== what needs to be branded: ===

* DistributionDefaultsAndBranding
* apache:
   - "no site here" page: 
      remove it from the apache package and make it depend on $distro-branding package that contains
      this page
    - serverstring: try to make it configurable and push it upstream
* bug-buddy: should magically work
* gdm:
    - default theme: try to push a patch upstream to make that easy
    - Disable the gdm face configuration item: ?
* gnome-cups-manager: neutralize test-page printing
* gnome-desktop: can be done at build-time (--with-gnome-distributor)
* lsb, lsb_release: ?
* gnome-system-tools: not a branding issue
* mozilla, epiphany: get homepage from $distro-branding, bookmarks, menu-items, homepage-url
    - need more work/thought on the application-branding
* openoffice.org:  ?
* ubuntu-artwork -> $distro-artwork, branding
* xscreensaver: needs upstream love to make it configurable (bounty)
* boot-splash: usplash-images: branding can go into the $distro-artwork
* kernel-image: neutralize it
* installer:
    - initial image when the you boot the cd: need to parameterize boot-cd, build-depends on ubuntu-artwork
