* Contacts lets you see images mailed/im'ed to you. Photo library automatically finds these images, no need to manually add them to your library. Spam is the obvious counterargument, but it can be addressed. 

* Album art is automatically discovered from your music collection. It can be modified by the user. Modifications show up automatically in the Music player. (US copyright law allows this - just don't distribute/make money from the result!)
