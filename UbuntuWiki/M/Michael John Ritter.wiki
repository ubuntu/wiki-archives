__TOC__

I help a charity called the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Society in Adelaide South Australia (see www.sacfs.asn.au) where I provide all the computing infrastructure. I have a Linux Ubuntu server in the office and it has Internet connectivity with FTP, Apache2 and SSH. I maintain and own a Ubuntu machine at home with just under two terrabytes of storage.

My interest is in programming (C/C++) and have been a programmer for about 20 years. I do little programming at the present time but can do a lot more. I want to do more.

Launchpad is a great opportunity contribute & do some programming. Maybe some beta testing first.

I have a Diploma in Computing and a Degree in Electronic Engineering.
