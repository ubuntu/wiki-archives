=== Open Week -- Intro to Ubuntu Studio -- Scott Lavender -- Fri, May 6 ===
<pre>
[16:02] <ClassBot> Logs for this session will be available at http://irclogs.ubuntu.com/2011/05/06/%23ubuntu-classroom.html following the conclusion of the session.
[16:03] <ScottL> Hello everyone, this is Intro to Ubuntu Studio and I'm Scott Lavender, Ubuntu Studio project lead
[16:03] <ScottL> before i launch into my shtick, is there anyone here with questions?
[16:04] <ScottL> if not, i'll move swiftly into it
[16:04] <ScottL> and i'll cover some commonly asked questions as well
[16:05] <ScottL> right, Ubuntu Studio is an officially recognized derivative of Ubuntu
[16:05] <ScottL> and as such shares the same code base as Ubuntu, specifically it uses the same repositories
[16:05] <ScottL> this means that any package available in Ubuntu is available in Ubuntu Studio, the inverse is true as well
[16:06] <ScottL> Ubuntu Studio has some definitive differences however in it's settings to help people use multimedia applications
[16:06] <ScottL> as well as some cosmetic changes, like a different theme and colors
[16:07] <ScottL> i would like to mention that another big change coming up is our push to get the -lowlatency kernel into the universe repository
[16:08] <ScottL> recent tests have shown that the -lowlatency kernel can half latencies (the time it takes for sound to be created, travel through your computer, and then be recorded/heard)
[16:09] <ScottL> and once the -lowlatency kernel is in the repositories it can be included as the default kernel in Ubuntu Studio
[16:09] <ScottL> this will be quite a significant accomplishment for the audio folks who rely on Ubuntu Studio and Ubuntu
[16:10] <ScottL> Ubuntu Studio also varies from Ubuntu in the packages that are shipped with it
[16:11] <ScottL> we tend not to install social media applications (e.g. gwibber) because this is not the focus of Ubuntu Studio
[16:11] <ScottL> this does not mean that it cannot be installed however
[16:11] <ScottL> apt-get install is still your friend
[16:12] <ScottL> we do ship numerous audio, video, and graphical applications for our users
[16:12] <ScottL> the choice of which applications to be install was based on developing "work flows" :  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuStudio/Workflows
[16:13] <ScottL> during the last cycle we decided to review what packages are shipped and take a "top down" approach
[16:14] <ScottL> we explored what "tasks" or "goals" our users might want to accomplish, developed work flows on the available tool chains that supported these tasks/goals
[16:15] <ScottL> i should point out that not all of the work flows on that link are supported in the release, we need to do some administrative work to that page to parse them as such still
[16:16] <ScottL> the result was that we ended up shipping fewer applications, having a smaller ISO image, but yielded a more effective distro
[16:16] <ScottL> any questions at this point?
[16:17] <ScottL> one of the common questions that is asked is about installing Ubuntu Studio
[16:18] <ScottL> many times (for various reasons) people would prefer to install vanilla Ubuntu first, and then install the Ubuntu Studio packages and people want to know if this is possible
[16:18] <ScottL> the answer is absolutely!
[16:19] <ScottL> however, there is a little more to it than simply adding the packages
[16:19] <ScottL> there are a few settings that need to be adjusted in order to make sure your system is configured the best to run JACK and other audio applications
[16:20] <ScottL> this is a good page for users to visit:  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuStudio
[16:21] <ScottL> and if you look for "upgrade from Ubuntu" under installation you will find more information about that
[16:21] <ScottL> !q
[16:21] <ScottL> ClassBot, !q
[16:22] <ClassBot> josker asked: when you said that ubuntu studio will ship lowlatency kernel, the changes will be made only into the sound driver ?
[16:22] <ScottL> josker, good question!
[16:23] <ScottL> the primary reasons for doing this (from a Ubuntu Studio perspective) is for the reason you stated, it helps improve performance for audio
[16:23] <ScottL> however...
[16:23] <ScottL> some people have reported that their desktop feels "snappier" as well
[16:24] <ScottL> unfortunately, no one has provided data to support that report
[16:25] <ScottL> i hope that answered your question josker, if not let me know
[16:26] <ScottL> another question asked is about networking and wifi
[16:27] <ScottL> historically we have shipped gnome-network-manager and our laptop users have reported significant trouble getting their wifi configured and running
[16:27] <ScottL> this is especially true for new users
[16:28] <ScottL> during Natty we made a decision to move to network-manager, which I believe is what ships with vanilla Ubuntu
[16:29] <ScottL> another question (from last year's open week) was regarding wallpapers, GDM backgrounds, and text colors
[16:30] <ScottL> the questions regarded how busy the wallpaper/background was and also how the text color was similar to the text box color in some cases
[16:30] <ScottL> while we didn't make any progress on this during Natty I do expect some rather large changes in Ocelot
[16:31] <ScottL> we have recently added an Art Lead to the team who will be focusing on these issues along with others
[16:31] <ScottL> we also have a few other improvements scheduled for Ocelot
[16:32] <ScottL> i've mentioned our goals for the -lowlatency kernel and theming/artwork issues
[16:33] <ScottL> we are planning our timeline for Ocelot and tentatively have plans to do the following:
[16:33] <ScottL>  * update the website
[16:33] <ScottL> the website hasn't seen any updates in years and is seeing some bit rot
[16:34] <ScottL> additionally we are revisiting the purpose and scope of the website and most likely will be added additional functionality to is as well
[16:34] <ScottL>  * update ubuntustudio-controls
[16:35] <ScottL> the -controls applcations allows user to change some of the system settings to help them tune their machine for audio work
[16:35] <ScottL> some of the functionality has been deprecated by changes in the kernel and firewire stack
[16:35] <ScottL> additionally, some of the functionality has changed due to upstream changes in JACK
[16:35] <ScottL> so we will be updating -controls for those reasons
[16:36] <ScottL> but we would like to introduce additional functionalities as well
[16:36] <ScottL> which should further help users with their work
[16:36] <ScottL>  * documentation
[16:37] <ScottL> this is a huge (and hugely importatant) under taking
[16:37] <ScottL> Ubuntu Studio has changed significantly over the years and the documentation hasn't quite kept up
[16:38] <ScottL> our tentative plan is to overhaul the entire documentation system in help.ubuntu.com to reflect the current state of Ubuntu Studio and the changes within the kernel and other applications
[16:38] <ScottL> it's a large, large job and we (possibly optimistally) expect it to take a year, especially given the size of the team and the other responsibilities
[16:39] <ScottL> of course, if anyone is interested in helping the Ubuntu Studio team they are most welcomed to contact us
[16:40] <ScottL> the developer mailing list can be found at:  https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-studio-devel
[16:40] <ScottL> if you need help as a user, you can find the user mailing list at: https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-studio-users
[16:40] <ScottL> as mentioned before, users can find help documentation at:  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuStudio
[16:41] <ScottL> our current website can be found at: http://ubuntustudio.org/
[16:42] <ScottL> if anyone has suggestions or comments about what they would like in the new website or about a new applications they would like to see in Ubuntu Studio, please contact us at the developer mailing list and let us know
[16:43] <ScottL> additionally, we have several IRC channels for support
[16:43] <ScottL> users can join #ubuntustudio here on freenode.net for help with Ubuntu Studio
[16:44] <ScottL> anyone wanted to speak to the developers directly can join #ubuntustudio-devel
[16:45] <ScottL> any questions at this time?
[16:46] <ScottL> another common question that is asked pertains to getting new packages into Ubuntu Studio
[16:47] <ScottL> one thing that the Ubuntu Studio team doesn't actively do is package applications
[16:47] <ScottL> this isn't a philosophical stance, it's more of a pragmatic, logistical issue
[16:47] <ScottL> we simple don't have experience packagers active on the team
[16:47] <ScottL> however, we do have a mechanism for effecting this
[16:48] <ScottL> i believe that most of the new audio applications (and even updates) tend to come from the Debian Multimedia Team
[16:48] <ScottL> they are a robust, experienced, and active group :)   for which i am very appreciative
[16:49] <ScottL> these packages see their way into the Ubuntu repositories at the beginning of each Ubuntu release cycle
[16:50] <ScottL> so if you want to see about getting a package into Ubuntu Studio, we still welcome your suggestions or nominations
[16:50] <ScottL> as we have cross team communications and can pass the request onto the Debian Multimedia Team
[16:51] <ScottL> there are some new and exciting LV2 plugins that i expect to see in Ocelot that are now in our repositories
[16:52] <ClassBot> There are 10 minutes remaining in the current session.
[16:53] <ScottL> another question that is posted with some frequency pertains to applications included in derivative distributions of Ubuntu Studio
[16:53] <ScottL> many times users explore other multimedia distributions that are derivatives of Ubuntu Studio
[16:54] <ScottL> and these distros include certain packages that are not in Ubuntu Studio and users ask why
[16:54] <ScottL> Ubuntu Studio can only ship packages that are hosting in the official archives (repositories)
[16:55] <ScottL> the build system (buildd) will only include packages from these archives
[16:55] <ScottL> if the package can not be included in the repositories, it can not ship with Ubuntu Studio
[16:55] <ScottL> and I should note that PPA's are not the official archives
[16:56] <ScottL> even though someone built Linux Sampler in a PPA, it can not be shipped on an Ubuntu Studio image
[16:57] <ScottL> if there is an application that users would like to see in Ubuntu Studio then we (meaning developers and users) bend our energies to getting it included in the repositories
[16:57] <ClassBot> There are 5 minutes remaining in the current session.
[16:59] <ScottL> I'm pretty much done, so if anyone doesn't have questions, i'll close with a reqeust
[16:59] <ScottL> a request even
[16:59] <ScottL> hi htcGuitarman and holstein  :)
[16:59] <ScottL> please give us your suggestions on how to improve Ubuntu Studio
[17:00] <ScottL> we welcome all suggestions and comments
[17:00] <ScottL> but please be aware there are limitations (e.g. licensing issues or logistics) to what we can accomplish
[17:00] <ScottL> thank you
