== Multisync with Sony Ericsson T637 Howto ==

=== Introduction ===

MultiSync is a free modular program to synchronize calendars, addressbooks and other PIM data between programs on your computer and other computers, mobile devices, PDAs or cell phones. MultiSync works on any Gnome platform, such as Linux

=== Installation ===

<pre>
sudo apt-get install multisync libmultisync-plugin-all
</pre>

This will install all the necessary dependencies for multisync, and ALL the plugins included with multisync. 

=== Configuration ===

This howto assumes that bluetooth support is present and working in both the computer and the cell phone. If you are not sure, or have not setup your blue tooth device, please follow the BluetoothSetup

Launch Multisync from '''Applications -> Accessories -> Multisync'''

Click '''New''' from main window to create a new synchronization pair.

Select IRMC Mobile device as the first plugin and Ximian Evolution as the second plugin. Also fill in an appropriate display name to remember this setting.

Click on the '''Options''' button next to each plugin selected and configure the plugins.

Click on '''Search for Units''' to locate your bluetooth phone. '''Make sure bluetooth in your phone is turned on and your phone is visible/discoverable'''. If Multisync is unable to locate your unit, try changing the channel to 10 for your bluetooth device and search again. If multisync has unable to find your unit, please follow the following instructions. 

Open up a terminal and type the following. 
<pre>
hcitool scan
</pre>
which should return your bluetooth phone address and name. 
<pre>
xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx       Test_Cell
</pre>
If the command does not return the correct output, you may need to get your bluetooth working first. Refer to the BluetoothSetup or  this <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=34740|ubuntuforums thread]]</nowiki>. 

Then from the main window, just select your configuration, and press sync. And presto...all your contacts from cellphone and evolution are syncronized.

=== To Do ===
Add more information about different cellphones. Contributions welcome :)

=== Motorola Pebl ===
I was not able to use multisync with my MotorolaPebl mobile phone yet. But I sync it in a dual boot configuration.
