== 8.04 (Hardy Heron) Release Party ==

=== What ===

The Ubuntu Minnesota Local Community Team and Penguins Unbound will be jointly putting on a release party and installfest to celebrate the new release of Ubuntu, the community-developed, open-source operating system.  The event will take place from 8:00 AM until 4:00 PM on Saturday, April 26th, at TIES in St. Paul, at the corner of Snelling and Larpenteur.  This will be a time to socialize with other open-source enthusiasts if you're already involved, or find out what open-source software is all about if it's a new thing for you.  There will be coffee, wireless access, and installation CD-ROMs provided, and pizza can be ordered for lunch.  We welcome small donations to cover the costs of burning CDs, but they are available absolutely free for anyone who wants one to check out.

This event is open to the public, and we would love to see some new faces, whether you've been using open-source software for years, or if you're just curious about how you can make your computer more secure, more stable, more configurable, and most of all, more fun and interesting!  This would also be a great time for teachers and school administrators to find out how they can save costs on computers with todays shrinking education budgets.  It will serve as an opportunity for people to find out what Ubuntu and free software in general is all about and ask questions of people already involved in the community.
