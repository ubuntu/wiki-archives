(09:05:39 AM) Keybuk: Martin is attempting to fix his network
(09:05:43 AM) Keybuk: and will be with us shortly
(09:06:40 AM) Keybuk: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DesktopTeam/Meeting/2008-02-28
(09:06:44 AM) Keybuk: aha, well done
(09:06:45 AM) Keybuk: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DesktopTeam/Meeting/2008-02-28
(09:06:46 AM) pitti: hrmpf, sorry; *$#$ network
(09:06:52 AM) Keybuk: I put together the lack of agenda
(09:06:55 AM) Keybuk: so this should be a nice short meeting
(09:07:03 AM) lool: pitti: Be happy that *you* have Internet at home *cough*  ;)
(09:07:06 AM) MacSlow: hey pitti
(09:07:22 AM) MacSlow: hey lool
(09:07:47 AM) pitti: lool: often, at least :)
(09:08:14 AM) Keybuk: As you almost all certainly know, Loïc will be leaving us and taking on the challenge of filling Mithrandir's shoes as technical lead of the Mobile Team
(09:08:25 AM) ***mvo waves goodbye to lool
(09:08:35 AM) Keybuk: he'll be still dabbling in desktop work for the remainder of the release, of course; and whenever he wants
(09:08:58 AM) ***lool waves -- we'll still work together!
(09:09:15 AM) MacSlow: lool, wow... I thought you were meant to become full member of the desktop team
(09:09:25 AM) Keybuk: we'll therefore shortly have an open position to fill Loïc's shoes
(09:09:40 AM) ***pitti hugs lool, thanks for your desktop work so far; it was greatly appreciated
(09:09:45 AM) lool: MacSlow: You're a packager now, you can replace me :)
(09:10:00 AM) ***MacSlow dies a painfull horrible death
(09:10:08 AM) Keybuk: I've mentioned this before in most of our catch-up calls, but if you know of anybody with good GNOME maintenance, packaging, bug triage/fixing, etc. experience then please do recommend them to me
(09:10:29 AM) Keybuk: lool: but then I'd have to replace him, and nobody's quite as insane with the bling :)
(09:11:32 AM) pitti: . o O { sjoerd }
(09:11:32 AM) Keybuk: I didn't see any agenda items in the summaries this week
(09:11:36 AM) ***MacSlow prefers to stay with computer-grapihcs and  UI
(09:11:38 AM) Keybuk: pitti: e-mail :p
(09:11:42 AM) Keybuk: (me)
(09:11:43 AM) tedg: I'm all about GL based packaging tool: gldch -i
(09:11:49 AM) Keybuk: did I miss any agenda items?
(09:11:57 AM) MacSlow: tedg, we can talk about that :)
(09:12:25 AM) Keybuk: apparently not :)
(09:12:40 AM) Keybuk: I didn't see anything added to https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DesktopTeam/ReportingPage either <g>
(09:12:48 AM) MacSlow: kwwii just burped like a devil
(09:12:51 AM) pitti: no bling stuff this week, just boring bug fixes
(09:12:52 AM) Keybuk: does anyone have any accomplishments from the past week they'd like to shout about
(09:12:53 AM) lool: Only borring stuff happened
(09:13:04 AM) pitti:  * make Ubuntu work a bit better
(09:13:19 AM) MacSlow: pitti, sorry.. doing packaging training (thanks mvo) and compiz-integration
(09:13:51 AM) Keybuk: ok
(09:13:58 AM) Keybuk: any thing from the activity reports people want to discuss?
(09:14:07 AM) ***MacSlow raises hand
(09:14:31 AM) MacSlow: hardy-desktop-effects-profiles is slacking a bit due to package-training.
(09:14:47 AM) seb128: GNOME has been updated to 2.21.92, I think I would write that
(09:15:03 AM) Keybuk: seb128: that would be good to add
(09:15:06 AM) seb128: and I've a svn gvfs snapshot with basic obex and ftp support on my disk
(09:15:13 AM) MacSlow: and next week is CeBIT (off-time) and after that gtk+ hackweek... so I'll have to finish the profiles stuff inbetween somehow *argx*
(09:15:15 AM) Keybuk: seb128: has Christian gotten started on things as well?
(09:15:23 AM) kwwii: we have a new gtk theme as well
(09:15:29 AM) Keybuk: kwwii: that should be added too :)
(09:15:52 AM) seb128: Keybuk: yes, he's actively working on webdav which seems to start working correctly now
(09:17:18 AM) Keybuk: ok, cool
(09:17:21 AM) Keybuk: any other business?
(09:17:37 AM) seb128: hardy is slooooow, but that's not really a meeting thing ;-)
(09:17:40 AM) Keybuk: slow?
(09:18:01 AM) seb128: 2 min from grub to desktop on my new dell laptop which is sloooow
(09:18:02 AM) mvo: io fells slower, but that is very subjective
(09:18:03 AM) pitti: boot is really fast, but gnome session start is sloooow
(09:18:08 AM) kwwii: sometime let me know when it is safe to upgrade from gutsy to hardy please
(09:18:10 AM) seb128: pitti: lucky you
(09:18:15 AM) Keybuk: interesting
(09:18:15 AM) kwwii: s/sometime/someone
(09:18:15 AM) mvo: boot is not fast for me
(09:18:21 AM) mvo: kwwii: do it!
(09:18:30 AM) seb128: pitti: it takes around 35 seconds to get the usplash bar to start moving there
(09:18:31 AM) pitti: gnome session startup is more than 1:30 minutes
(09:18:37 AM) kwwii: mvo: as long as you will offer free telephone support :-)
(09:18:39 AM) seb128: the detecting hardware steps seems to take ages
(09:18:44 AM) Keybuk: seb128: could you install bootchart and throw one onto ubuntu-devel ?
(09:18:52 AM) Keybuk: also udev.log I guess if it's that stage
(09:18:53 AM) seb128: Keybuk: will do
(09:18:55 AM) MacSlow: kwwii, yeah... you coward... update now!
(09:19:40 AM) Keybuk: seb128: that'll encourage others to join in, and we'll get an idea whether it is or not
(09:20:21 AM) Keybuk: ok, let's keep the meeting short then
(09:20:22 AM) Keybuk: thanks everybody
(09:20:54 AM) seb128: http://www.kagou.fr/boot.jpg
(09:20:58 AM) seb128: speaking about speed
(09:21:07 AM) seb128: I was speaking with kagou which was testing random distros
(09:21:23 AM) seb128: the blue bars are grub to gdm, the red ones gdm to desktop
(09:21:30 AM) Keybuk: hardy hasn't had readahead updated yet, so it's not surprising it's slow
(09:22:38 AM) Keybuk: and apparmor is a piece of shit
(09:22:47 AM) Keybuk: . o O { did I just say that out loud? }
(09:22:53 AM) MacSlow: for me only starting compiz takes its time
(09:23:04 AM) MacSlow: everything else is quite fast
(09:23:22 AM) Hobbsee: Keybuk: in a logged channel :)
(09:24:46 AM) pitti: so, thanks everyone
(09:25:07 AM) seb128: thanks
(09:25:14 AM) MacSlow: Hobbsee, everybody has his/her dare-devil-moments :)
(09:25:32 AM) Keybuk: --done--
