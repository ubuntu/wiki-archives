== About me ==

I was born in 1972 and I live in Alleur (Belgium).
I'm software developer Java/.NET.

== Why Ubuntu ==

I started to use Ubuntu in March 2008.

I wanted to have an other point of view of the computer world than the Windows point of view.

I have found : 
* A reliable operating system wich gives me satisfaction,
* A dynamic community, 
* Easy way to get documentation and to get help.

Now i want to give a little contribution to the community.
I am involved in french translation activities mostly in the following projects :
* Audacious Media Player,
* GNOME Do,
* Stellarium.
