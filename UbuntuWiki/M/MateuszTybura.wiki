== About me ==

My name is Mateusz Tybura. I'm 18 years old male student of Zespół Szkół Elektronicznych in Rzeszów.
I started to use Linux since some about July 2004. I'm still improving my computer skill, because I want to be a programmer in the future.

My first Ubuntu was Ubuntu 6.06. I discovered it from some IT paper. I promote Linux among my friends and teachers. 

My website (in polish) : http://wujciol.yoyo.pl/

== Contributions ==

I became a member of Ubuntu Community at 8th of October 2007. I was member of official '''Ubuntu Polish Translators''' team.
