Welcome to my wiki page. 

I'm currently testing drapper on my Sony Vaio SZ1XP and will soon publish my findings in a laptop wiki page. Watch this space. If you have any questions regarding Ubuntu setup on this laptop before i publish my findings, please do email me on the address provided above.

I also run a forum dedicated to discussion of Voice over IP, which you may view http://ukvoiptalk.com

Thanks

Matt
