=== About Me ===
My name is Martin Šácha, and I live in Prague, Czech Republic. On the web, you can find me under nickname "sachy", sometimes in Czech writed as "šachy".

My professional life consists of assembler programming for Mainframes (CA IMS Tools for z/OS), I have some experience with web application programming too.

Linux, especially Ubuntu, is filling my allday life from, let say, 2009 when I installed Jaunty Jackalope as my primary OS. I have done some experiments with other distros before, but only Ubuntu catched me. I like the community around Ubuntu and giving into my best skills and expertise.
