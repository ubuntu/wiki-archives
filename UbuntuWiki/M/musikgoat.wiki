I am finishing school soon (BofCS) and have been actively using Ubuntu for the past 3 years (exclusively using it on my laptop and server for the last 1.5 years)  I was able to bring my CS teacher over to Ubuntu before his open source software class started, and got about 60 CS students to start using it instead of Redhat.  I am a bit of an Ubuntu zealot, as this community is not like any other.    I hope to be a member of this community soon.

As can be found through launchpad, I've done some bug reporting and testing, and have helped as much as possible in the irc rooms.  I have not been very active on the forums though. 

I hope to see Ubuntu become the distro of choice for all intro Linux classes in high schools and colleges, as it is conducive to learning!

I have recently joined the Ubuntu Chicago LoCo Team: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ChicagoTeam
