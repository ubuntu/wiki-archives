I sir, have designated the term 'master5o1' as an alias for my interweb related activities. I have also designated the term 'iam5o1' as well. However, my real name is <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~iam5o1|Jason Schwarzenberger]]</nowiki>. One must agree that Ubuntu happens to be the best operating system, ever.

One may contact me through certain methods. My email can be found at my <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~iam5o1|Launchpad profile]]</nowiki>.

There is really only one reason that I can think of that my provoke one to contact me and that would be my involvement in the <nowiki>[[LaptopTestingTeam-Old-Dell-DellInspiron1720|Dell Inspiron1720]]</nowiki> Laptop testing page. Any queries may be sent to the iam5o1.2 email address found in my <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~iam5o1|Launchpad profile]]</nowiki>.

Good day sir, I must be off as I believe it is time for my tea break.
