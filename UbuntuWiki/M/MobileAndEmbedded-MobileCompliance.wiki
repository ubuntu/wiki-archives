=== Summary ===

Intel is creating a compliance specification to qualify OS distributions as capable for satisfying the requirements needed for a  for a Mobile Internet Device.

Specification: http://moblin.org/repos/users/bspencer/MID_Core_Requirements_0.5.pdf <<BR>>
URL: http://moblin.org/documentation_corerequirements.php

=== UDS Discussion ===
At Boston 2007 UDS, the Moblin Compliance specification was introduced.  Here are the comments:

'''General'''
* Media formats listed are not patent free.  They can not be in the core.
* Ubuntu-mobile core will not be compliant, OEM's may be.
* Adobe Flash has restrictions

* If you lock onto a library too early you have duplicate libraries that do the same thing.

'''Questions about libraries'''
* GL?
* dbus version is old (missing audio, hifi support)
* Helix -- is it going to be open?  
* libgnomevfs-2 deprecated and will be replaced with libgvfs/libgio, ultimately will be part of glib
* clutter is new, should it be required? => risky, can change SONAME
* libgstcheck-0.10.so.0 -- only used by unit testing

* Need: python-gtk2, python-hildon, python-dbus, etc. (and perhaps dependencies)
* libgst*: usually libraries used by plugins => perhaps you want to list GStreamer plugins which should be present instead?
* Need: Java minimum requirements
* Need: Power management requirements
* Need: security requirements. -- what does it mean? (in diagram but not referenced elsewhere)
* Need: GRE version.  Change to Gecko Runtime Env, "GRE" not commonly associated with Gecko. (What does Firefox 3.0 use wrt xulrunner)

Some technologies not ready to pick version: telepathy, EDS.  (For these, specify that a new version of it should be there, without dictating now which version. )
