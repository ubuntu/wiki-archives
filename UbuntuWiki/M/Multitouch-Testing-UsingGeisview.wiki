__TOC__

You can confirm that your device and the gesture stack are working properly by using Geisview. First, install the geis tools package. Then, run geisview:
<pre>
$ geisview
</pre>

A diagnostics window will pop up. It will list gesture classes and any supported multitouch devices. When you perform gestures on the devices, the gesture events will be appended to the list. You can open any item to examine its details.
