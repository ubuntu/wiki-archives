{{https://nerdzoom.media/Marius_Quabeck_Ubuntu_Wiki_2025.jpg||width=250}}

Hi, I’m Marius Quabeck! 
My first Ubuntu release was Ubuntu 11.10 (Oneiric Ocelot) and I began contributing to Ubuntu in 2015, marking the start of my journey into the world of open source. I became a Ubuntu Member in 2016. Today, I run my own company, <nowiki>[[https://nerdzoom.media|NerdZoom Media]]</nowiki>, specializing in audio and video production. Alongside this, I work part-time with the <nowiki>[[https://osb-alliance.de|Open Source Business Alliance]]</nowiki> where I advocate for the adoption of open source software, and I do the same on a European level for <nowiki>[[https://apell.info|APELL - The European Open Source Software Business Association]]</nowiki>. Over the years, I’ve worked for various open source projects, including <nowiki>[[https://nextcloud.com|Nextcloud]]</nowiki>, contributing to their marketing and community initiatives.

=== Things I do for Ubuntu ===

==== Community ====

* From 2015 to 2018, I managed UbuntuFun.de, a blog dedicated to writing about Ubuntu releases, community updates, and open-source software. During its run, we published hundreds of posts, offering insights and news for enthusiasts and developers alike. In the final two years of the project, we expanded the platform to include a podcast, bringing discussions and updates to a broader audience.
* In 2017, I launched <nowiki>[[https://nerdzoom.de|NerdZoom.de]]</nowiki>, my blog where my friends and I share our passion for open-source software.
* Contributed guest posts to the <nowiki>[[https://ubuntu.com/blog/ubucon-europe-2017|official Ubuntu blog]]</nowiki>
* I’m an avid podcaster, regularly discussing open-source topics, often with a focus on Ubuntu. My two main shows, <nowiki>[[https://techniktechnik.de|TechnikTechnik]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[https://faxinformatiker.de|Faxinformatiker]]</nowiki>, provide engaging conversations that blend technical insights with humor and relatable stories.
* As an editor for <nowiki>[[https://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com|Jupiter Broadcasting]]</nowiki>, I’ve worked on hundreds of episodes centered around Linux and open-source topics. My contributions include editing popular programs like <nowiki>[[https://linuxactionnews.com|Linux Action News]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[https://selfhosted.show|Self-Hosted]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[https://extras.show/tags/brunch%20with%20brent|Brunch with Brent]]</nowiki>, and many others, ensuring high-quality content for a dedicated audience.
* I edit the podcast <nowiki>[[https://www.badvoltage.org|Bad Voltage]]</nowiki>, where hosts Jono Bacon, Jeremy Garcia, and Stuart Langridge deliver lively discussions on technology, culture, and open source.
* Editor for the German <nowiki>[[https://www.linux-magazin.de|Linux-Magazin]]</nowiki>, contributing to high-quality content that informs and educates the Linux and open-source community.
* Frequently guest on various podcasts, including <nowiki>[[https://focusonlinux.podigee.io|FOCUS ON: Linux]]</nowiki>, where I share insights and discuss Ubuntu and its role in the broader Linux and open-source ecosystem.

==== Development ====

* I developed <nowiki>[[https://github.com/MariusQuabeck/magic-device-tool|magic-device-tool]]</nowiki>, a comprehensive tool for installing and replacing operating systems on mobile devices.

=== Room for Improvement ===

There are areas where I'd like to improve myself and my own knowledge:

* Write more blog posts
* contribute to the Ubuntu Community's governance structure

=== Ubuntu Membership Board ===
I became a member of the Ubuntu Membership Board <nowiki>[[https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/new-ubuntu-membership-board-2024/51814|in late December 2024]]</nowiki>, where I actively participate in board meetings, Ubuntu governance syncs, and the review of membership applications.

Becoming a Ubuntu member was a significant milestone for me, and I hope to inspire others on their journey. I enjoy supporting applicants by explaining the process, reviewing applications, and providing guidance whenever needed.

I know Marius as a very friendly helpful person, running (or at least helping out with that) a bunch of German related Ubuntu communiy. As a co-author for http://ubuntufun.de and managing a Telegram group for German Ubuntu users, he's always around, helping newcomers to get started. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:mzanetti]]</nowiki> 
Marius is a very nice and kind guy always keen helping other people out. By running UbuntuFun.de and the related Telegram group he provides great exchange points for the German Ubuntu community.  -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:tim-sueberkrueb]]</nowiki> 
I met Marius in the MWC 2016. A great guy who could be a key member in Ubuntu, because he is working in areas not so common in others members, like podcast, in music, photography... He is so active in Ubuntu Touch too because he is writing in the important UbuntuFun.de and he is working for the first Ubuncon Europe. I honestly think that he deserves to be an Ubuntu Member. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:costales]]</nowiki>

I first met Marius on Telegram and then in person at Ubucon DE 2015 in Berlin. We are both on the organising team for UbuCon Europe 2016. He does an insane amount of work for the german UbuntuFun news website, from managing the community Telegram channel to producing podcasts. Lots of people already mistake him for an actual Canonical employee. He even flew to Mobile World Congress 2016 in Barcelona on his own account! I can only wholeheartedly support his application. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:Sturmflut]]</nowiki> 
Marius is a great Ubuntu enthusiast and it's for me a great pleasure everytime I talk with him about Ubuntu, Ubuntu Touch and life. Being an Ubuntu Member should be for him another step in his Ubuntu way of life. Muito obrigado pela tua paixão, Marius! -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:tcarrondo]]</nowiki>
