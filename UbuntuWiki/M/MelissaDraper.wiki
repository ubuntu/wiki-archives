== IRC Council Nomination 2019-2021 ==

As a long time member of the IRC team and Council I have valuable historical knowledge of the Ubuntu IRC ecosystem and the challenges we've faced over the years. I am proud of the self-sufficient channels that we've fostered in freenode's ubuntu namespace that are self-moderating and rarely need to call in reinforcements.

I believe that volunteer contributors benefit from a hands-off approach with minimal bureaucracy but management that is proactive when necessary, is accessible, and negotiates empathetically when issues arise but that is also willing to make tough calls to rectify problems.

The next IRCC should ideally recommence occasional meetings as schedules allow and evaluate our operators lists and if deemed necessary recruit some new ones.
