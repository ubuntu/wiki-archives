My name is Đại Trí Mẫn Lê. I'm currently a graduate Computer Science student at <nowiki>[[http://www.mcmaster.ca|McMaster University]]</nowiki> Canada.

My interest focuses on formal methods and foundation of software engineering. I hope my work can contribute to improving the process of designing and implementing software system by discovering techniques taken directly or inspired from different branches of Mathematics, Logic, Philosophy and other sciences.

To know more about me please visit my <nowiki>[[http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/~ledt/index.html|homepage]]</nowiki>.

I hope that the work of our Vietnamese Ubuntu Team will introduce Ubuntu OS to more and more Vietnamese users. Hopefully these pieces of documentation will be the starting points to help the beginners overcoming some technical difficulties in their first steps using Ubuntu OS.
