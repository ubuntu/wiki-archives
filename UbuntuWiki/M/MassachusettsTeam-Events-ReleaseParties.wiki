__TOC__



Once a new version of Ubuntu is released, there will be plenty to celebrate, whether you were directly involved with the release process or just rejoice because the next iteration of the best distribution is finally out. We hold a release party for each new release.

* **Please note that this is '''''not''''' an <nowiki>[[..-InstallFests|InstallFest]]</nowiki>. It is a social gathering to celebrate the next version of Ubuntu. 

== Next Party ==
JauntyJackalope is scheduled for <nowiki>[[JauntyReleaseSchedule|release]]</nowiki> on '''April 23^rd^ 2009'''. See <nowiki>[[:MassachusettsTeam-Events-ReleaseParties-9.04-JauntyJackalope|here]]</nowiki> for details.
