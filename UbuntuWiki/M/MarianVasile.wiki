Hi everybody! (including here little green beings from out of space)

I discovered Ubuntu three years ago and never looked back. Because I understand the true value of this gift that is here for everybody, I decided to join the community to give something back as well.
So here I am, member of Ubuntu Romanian Localization.

== Contact ==
E-mail: marianvasile@upcmail.ro

== Past activities ==
I was involved in translating Ubuntu Desktop Course into Romanian, of course, and Launchpad

== Current activities ==
I decided to be involved mainly in translating the description of Ubuntu main package from Synaptic and providing support for beginners to adopt Ubuntu (romanian forum - <nowiki>[[http://forum.ubuntu.ro/index.php]]</nowiki>).

== Future activities ==
Hoping to have more time to promote Ubuntu and work in translations.
