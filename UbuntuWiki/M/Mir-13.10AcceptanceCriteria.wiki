== Landing (X)Mir in Ubuntu 13.10 ==

(X)Mir is targeted to land in Ubuntu 13.10 in order to be fully ready for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

In order to protect Ubuntu from any quality regression caused by the introduction of (X)Mir, we are proposing  a set of acceptance criteria. 

The rollout of (X)Mir is going to happen in 3 phases which have criteria attached to them.
# Landing of all packages in main/universe
# Landing of all 13.10 features before Feature Freeze
# Enabling (X)Mir by default by Final Freeze

=== Landing packages in main/universe ===
(X)Mir consists of 7 core elements
# patches to X.org, gated by compile and runtime switches
# patches to the open X drivers, intel, nouveau, radeon, gated by compile & runtime switches
# patches to Mesa
# the unity-system-compositor packages, which will enable (X)Mir on the system
# the mir packages for client and server, which will be used by unity-system-compositor

We have been working with the Ubuntu Desktop team to ensure that all changes to existing packages (X.org, drivers, mesa) are following the packaging and distro landing standards. In addition, we have put runtime checks for XMir code in place so that the new code won't be executed if you are not running (X)Mir.
The changes for X.org, the free drivers and Mesa have been added to the respective packages and are in main already. The Mir client & server libraries are also in main, but do not impact the system behavior.

The unity-system-compositor package also followed the packaging & distro landing standards and will be put first into universe. This will allow interested parties to install directly from the archive but still draws a line of having it part of the core Ubuntu platform.

=== Landing all 13.10 features before Feature Freeze ===
There are 3 key features that are mandatory for 13.10:
# Multi monitor support
# Composite bypass
# Fallback to X.org for systems that are using unsupported (i.e. proprietary) drivers

These features are targeted to land prior to Feature Freeze and the landing will follow the usual standards (i.e. unit tests available, passing daily landing integration tests).

We are intending to do a larger community call for testing once these features are in a testable state.

We do not anticipate delays in landing these features, but have proactively started to file Feature freeze exceptions to keep the release team informed of the status:
* <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mir/+bug/1209419|Multiple monitor support]]</nowiki>  
* <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mir/+bug/1209418|Rendering Bypass support]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mir/+bug/1209417|Nested Compositor support]]</nowiki>

=== Enabling (X)Mir by default by Final Freeze ===

Before turning (X)Mir on by default following criteria need to be met:
 
==== general ====
* Unit tests on all packages running and passing on all archs
* GPU blacklist capability implemented
* 13.10 features implemented or decided to be postponed
* Performance penalty is 10% or less on defined set of hardware
* Call for testing has happened and critical issues have been fixed

==== hardware coverage ====
System and performance tests have been executed and pass on following reference systems in the Canonical QA lab
* Intel HD graphics 2xxx, 3xxx, 4xxx,
* AMD Evergreen, Northern & Southern Islands, Sea Islands
* Nvidia graphics GeForce 300, 400, 600

Wide hardware coverage tests have been executed on systems available in the Canonical certification lab.

==== functional ====
* Mir unit tests must be 100% passing
* XMir should boot into XMir/no fallback for the Mesa(intel), Radeon(amd), & Nouveau (nvidia) open source drivers
* The following X applications should be able to launch and be used without visual corruption or crashing
** Unity7 integration tests
** Libre Office
** Thunderbird
** Firefox
** Chrome browser
** Qt Creator
** GEdit
* XMir should be able to be disabled & platform boot into X by commenting out type=unity in unity-system-compositor.conf
* XMir must support additional monitor connections
** at least 2 monitors
** must support change in resolution
** mirror mode with scaling to the large screen resolution & extended mode   * extended mode must be configurable in terms of display relationships (e.g. is 2nd display to the right, left, top, bottom, rotated displays)
** connection can be through vga, dvi, hdmi, display port

==== performance ====
* X vs XMir performance should be less than a 10% hit for the following tests
** OpenArena 800x600 (measured in fps)
** OpenArena 1280x800 (measured in fps)
** Nexuiz 800x600 w/ HDR on, no audio (measured in fps)
** Nexuiz 1280x800 w/ HDR on, no audio (measured in fps)
** Nexuiz 800x600 w/ HDR off, no audio (measured in fps)
** Nexuiz 1280x800 w/ HDR off, no audio (measured in fps)
** QGears2: OpenGL + Gears (measured in fps)
** QGears2: Xrender + Text (measured in fps)
** QGears2: Xrender + Gears (measured in fps)
** QGears2: OpenGL + Image scaling (measured in fps)
** GtkPerf: gtkcombobox (measured in seconds)
** GtkPerf: gtkradiobutton (measured in seconds)
** GtkPerf: GtkDrawingArea - Pixbufs (measured in seconds)

==== bug status ====
No critical bugs filed in launchpad against unity-system-compositor, mir, or lightdm
