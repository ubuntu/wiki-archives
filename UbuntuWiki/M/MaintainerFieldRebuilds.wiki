__TOC__

This page coordinates package rebuilds for UbuntuSpec:debian-maintainer-field.

We want all feisty/main binary packages to have correct Maintainer: fields by the beta release.

The list of packages that need to be rebuilt can be generated like this:

<pre>
wget -O - http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/feisty/main/binary-i386/Packages.gz | gunzip | grep-dctrl -sSource:Package,Package,Maintainer,Original-Maintainer -FVersion ubuntu  | grep-dctrl -sSource:Package -FMaintainer -v -n ubuntu | cut -d' ' -f1 | sort -u
</pre>

This will be gradually done by MartinPitt with an automatic script.

However, some maintainers explicitly want to take responsibility for this for the following packages, in order to avoid redundant rebuilds:

=== SebastienBacher ===

* *gnome*
* X.org related stuff

=== MatthiasKlose ===

* openoffice.org-l10n-*
