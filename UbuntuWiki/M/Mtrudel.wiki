=== Community Contributions ===

* I'm very active in the Ubuntu-QC team. There are lots of challenges (people geographically dispersed, not always willing to travel...), but also a lot of interest.
** Organized, with <nowiki>[[komputes]]</nowiki>, the <nowiki>[[QuebecTeam-GlobalJam|Ubuntu Global Jam]]</nowiki> in Montreal. 
** Many thanks to ETS (Ecole de Technologie Superieure), as well as Clod Patry and Guillaume Grasset for help and booking the rooms in 2009 and March 2010.
** Many thanks to SupInfo and Aurelien Fernandes for help and booking the rooms in August 2010.
** Organized the Montreal Karmic, Lucid release party. See <nowiki>[[QuebecTeam-KarmicParty]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[QuebecTeam-LucidParty]]</nowiki>.
** <nowiki>[[Hour|Ubuntu Hour]]</nowiki> - Longueuil

== Activities ==

=== Current ===

* I stay involved in bug triaging, fixing some bugs, and packaging software.
** I'm paying a close attention to bugs related to network-manager and its vpn plugins.

* Packaging multiple new or updated software:
** Concordance - a library and command-line tools for configuring Logitech Harmony remotes.
** Congruity - GUI program to configure Logitech Harmony remotes.
** Acct - GNU Process and System Accounting utilities
** Network-manager-openconnect - VPN client plugin for NetworkManager, to connect to Cisco AnyConnect VPN systems.

=== Future Plans ===

* (medium term) Improve the situation for PKI / authentication infrastructure on Ubuntu; as most things are outdated or half-broken -- freeipa is hard to install, dogtag same, can't really talk about semi-proprietary Java products that are hard to use...
* (long term) Sit for a term on the Ubuntu Technical Board.
* (long term) Stay up to date on cloud products.

== Testimonials for Membership Application ==

* I'm glad Mathieu has finally applied for membership! I met Mathieu through a mutual friend and he's helped me out when I needed to find people to help with Ubuntu EC2 testing as well as being a great "sysadmin who can test/verify/fix bugs" for a bunch of random bugs I needed help with over the past few cycles. Matthieu knows not only how to work with existing ubuntu developers but also upstreams and Debian. I think membership will be a good first step and encourage him to keep going and become an Ubuntu developer! -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:jorge]]</nowiki>  * What can I say, Mathieu is a fantastic member of the community ! He's quite active on Quebec's IRC channel and other Ubuntu channels, the mailing list and in events. He helped a lot in our two last major events (Global Jam and Release Party) and he keeps showing up in some annoying bugs :) He's great at showing off Ubuntu to new users and answering questions too. So, a big YEAH for me regarding membership -- -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:magicfab]]</nowiki>
