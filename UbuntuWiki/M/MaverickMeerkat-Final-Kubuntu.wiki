=== Ubiquity Installer ===
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <tablewidth="60%">Our installer has had a few changes. On boot Ubiquity will offer you the option of running the live system or installing directly.

|-
| <nowiki>[[attachment:ubiquity2.png|<nowiki>[[File:ubiquity2-wee.png]]</nowiki></nowiki>]]
| 
| Ubiquity now lets you download updates and restricted packages such as MP3 playback during the install so you don't have to do them later (of course you will need internet access for this).
|-
| The installation process starts right after the disk setup page, before you have completed the remaining setup tasks, so it'll be ready to use sooner.

=== Improved KPackageKit ===
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <tablewidth="60%">KPackageKit for Kubuntu now has an application-focused view as part of it's updated user interface. You now can find individual packages by searching by name. The backend has been changed to the much faster aptcc to ensure your installs are as quick as possible.

=== New default web browser - Rekonq ===
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <tablewidth="60%">Rekonq is now the web browser for Kubuntu.

=== New Ubuntu Font ===
The default font on the install media is now the <nowiki>[[http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/537|Ubuntu font]]</nowiki>.

| <tablewidth="60%">Plasma Netbook now sports the <nowiki>[[http://agateau.wordpress.com/2010/05/10/getting-menus-out-of-application-windows/|Global Menu]]</nowiki> by default.  This innovation helps conserve vertical space on small netbook screens.  In combination with the Plasma Netbook panel no longer auto hiding by default this represents a significant improvement in Plasma Netbook usability from previous releases.
