Welcome To The Migration Team.
We Will Help Others Who Come From Windows To Be Comfortable With The Ubuntu/Linux Interface.
We Usually Help People Who Are Experienced With Computers But Is Ready For A Change.
Some Of The Questions We Might Answer Is: What's A Repository? How Do I Use The Terminal. How Can I Add A Repository? Or Other Questions.
Were A Little Different Than The Beginner Team Because We Help People Already USED To Using Computers And Need A Little Boost On Using Linux. We Dont Go From Ground Up. But We Just Give Those In Need Of A Little Boost, A Power Boost.
Join Us At Our Launchpad Team <nowiki>[[http://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-migration|Here]]</nowiki>
