__TOC__

=== Must Have ===
* UTF-8
* optional bzipped packages
* Unified hardware detection for installer and Live CD
* Python-base in Essential
* Automated testing of:
** Warty-Hoary, Woody-Hoary, Sarge-Hoary upgrade
** Packages post-build
** package install / remove / purge lint
** policy (network port listening etc)
* LanguagePacks
* LTSP in the box
* kickstart (mass installation mode)
* X.org
* Gnome 2.10
* easy "core set" package installation gui
* ongoing review process of Fedora, Cooker and SUSE's bleeding edge for interesting open source patches
* minimum match existing hardware detection capability of mandrake, suse, redhat
* install-without-restricted
* hardware db
** with integrated "report back" feature from livecd, installed system

=== High Priority ===
* ubusplash
* single kernel source throughout (live / installer / installed)
* better keyboard / keymap selection for console & X
* proxy support for update-during-install
* usb-storage-device-bootable installer
* individual app integration with rosetta, malone, and launchpad support system, community chat and discussion lists etc
* GDM polish:
** better language / options selection
** more dimming / fading / transition eye candy
** MNG or something similar
** neater looking dialogs
* better synaptic / aptitude search
* security update notification gui
* bluetooth with gui
* improved gnome panel (theming, recently-used-apps, better wifi and battery icons turned into  notification icons)
* smarter CUPS config and printer autodetection
* some sort of video playback, even if it's not a widespread codec
* some good PDA sync framework
* slick sound theme
* holistic, coordinated network setup and management
** network manager, ifrename, wifi, the whole bang shoot
** consistent from installer to desktop
** special emphasis on wifi
* complete SVG high-quality icon set
* svg-aware eye candy: alt-tab app switcher, panel 

=== Nice To Have ===
* faster (sooner) gdm startup
* faster (sooner) hotplug
* smarter dhcp when there's no link beat
* PPC64
* LSB i386 on amd64
* graphical installer mode
* multiple network devices of the same time sensibly handled
* fax support
* zeroconf plan

=== Your Call ===
* fresher glibc / gcc / toolchain

=== Vaguely Maybe ===
* SE linux work (but makes me very nervous)
