May 27 21:36:11 <viyyer>	A thin, silent man in a welder's mask who spot welds dead canines to evildoers. The question of how exactly one can weld a flesh and blood animal to a person is not answered by the series.
May 27 21:36:19 <DrDogwelder>	and I'm allergic to dogs.
May 27 21:36:50 <f0o>	DrDogwelder:  dont let them pick at your name their just being f0olish
May 27 21:37:37 <viyyer>	f0o, alright alright. I'll stop my research into dogwelding science
May 27 21:37:53 <Iowan>	DrDogwelder:  I'd like to claim this is non-typical behavior, but...
May 27 21:38:23 <DrDogwelder>	My nephew gave me the name years ago as an artists name (I'm no artist either).  I didn't know it was a comic character till a year or two ago.
May 27 21:38:24 <viyyer>	your nick is so untypical too :)
May 27 21:38:37 <f0o>	Iowan: come on.. im blaming the 4 monsters drinks i had
May 27 21:38:53 <f0o>	DrDogwelder: so we heard what you dont do.... tell me what you do do
May 27 21:39:27 <Iowan>	f0o:  practice for weekend?
May 27 21:40:06 <DrDogwelder>	Looks like I fire up xchat and get heckled in #ubuntu-us-ia.
May 27 21:40:09 <f0o>	Iowan: actually i have been putting in 14 hr days this week and last week
May 27 21:40:13 <DrDogwelder>	Most fun I had all day.
May 27 21:40:46 <Iowan>	DrDogwelder:  Musta been a heck of a day...
May 27 21:40:47 <f0o>	DrDogwelder: we only heckle friends
May 27 21:40:55 <DrDogwelder>	I've never seen any activity here before.
May 27 21:41:23 <viyyer>	DrDogwelder, happens when it is active :)
May 27 21:41:38 <f0o>	DrDogwelder: oh theirs activity here  usually atomicspark is talking all our ears off
May 27 21:42:17 <DrDogwelder>	Always had to go the the Tennessee channel to see any activity.
May 27 21:42:24 <viyyer>	I am waiting for transfer of 400GB of files across usb on mc.
May 27 21:42:26 <f0o>	who havent we heard from godbyk are out there
May 27 21:42:49 <f0o>	viyyer: 400gb of what
May 27 21:42:56 <godbyk>	What's up?
May 27 21:43:03 <f0o>	are you a bot
May 27 21:43:17 <DrDogwelder>	Probably 400gb of ones and zeros.
May 27 21:43:20 <DrDogwelder>	Just a guess.
May 27 21:43:20 <godbyk>	Is this a Turing test?
May 27 21:43:44 <f0o>	i dont know what turing is
May 27 21:44:03 <f0o>	im kinda the village idiot
May 27 21:44:08 <Iowan>	f0o:  You're having good luck raising responses - wanna try for Amaranth ?
May 27 21:44:27 <godbyk>	f0o: See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing
May 27 21:44:41 <f0o>	shhh not yet im working on godbyk dont tell him im trying to figure out if he is a bot
May 27 21:44:47 <Amaranth>	sorry, busy writing a javascript library to access google voice so I can make a palm pre app
May 27 21:45:13 <viyyer>	f0o, well right now 2300gb of video. looking at setting up a local video repository for the library here.
May 27 21:45:45 <viyyer>	godbyk, why do you think this is a turing test?
May 27 21:46:20 <Iowan>	Wow - this is gonna take >2 pages on the meeting report
May 27 21:46:27 <godbyk>	f0o asked if I was a bot.  He's taking a rather direct approach, apparently.
May 27 21:46:30 *	viyyer tries to act like the emacs psychotherapist
May 27 21:47:47 <f0o>	Amaranth: java script champ me thinks
May 27 21:48:10 <f0o>	i think godbky thinks my question is ghey
May 27 21:48:32 <viyyer>	ghey??
May 27 21:49:09 <f0o>	yes
May 27 21:49:49 <viyyer>	interesting http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Ghey
May 27 21:51:55 <f0o>	viyyer: what kind of video repo, what material
May 27 21:52:25 <f0o>	viyyer: i like the dude on roller blades outfit in that link
May 27 21:52:44 <f0o>	DrDogwelder: what part of iowa you from
May 27 21:53:12 <Iowan>	or Tennessee - or...
May 27 21:53:29 <f0o>	Iowan: everyone in the channel talked tonight.... thats a record
May 27 21:54:19 <paultag>	hell yeah!
May 27 21:54:26 <Iowan>	f0o:  Yep - and it's all "official"... except for the "present" stuff...
May 27 21:55:00 <f0o>	Iowan: ya leave that out of the minutes good call

May 27 21:56:04 <DrDogwelder>	Or was there one till I got here?
May 27 21:56:15 <Iowan>	IF we were using the Logbot - we'd start w/ #startmeeting, end with #endmeeting
May 27 21:56:17 <f0o>	DrDogwelder: its open
May 27 21:56:35 <Iowan>	and everyone would log in by stating PRESENT
May 27 21:56:41 <DrDogwelder>	I was just wondering if I missed it.
May 27 21:56:52 <Iowan>	I think I can figure out who is actually here... everyone!
May 27 21:57:20 <f0o>	Iowan: u sure
May 27 21:57:30 <f0o>	dont count atomic :0

May 27 21:58:12 <Iowan>	Officially the last Thurs of month for awhile @8:00
May 27 21:58:49 <Iowan>	Ordinarily ends @9:00 - but when we're on a roll...
May 27 21:58:58 <DrDogwelder>	Cool!  I'll have to see if I can remember it next month.
May 27 21:59:30 <f0o>	DrDogwelder: get on the mailing list iowan will remind you
May 27 21:59:42 <Iowan>	There's ... outtyped!
May 27 22:01:59 <Iowan>	DrDogwelder: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/IowaTeam
May 27 22:02:12 <DrDogwelder>	I haven't checked the loco page in a long time.  Didn't see that there was a list.
May 27 22:03:35 <DrDogwelder>	I guess I saw that there was a list.  I just didn't see that it's had activity.
May 27 22:03:37 <f0o>	godbyk: you there
May 27 22:03:50 <godbyk>	f0o: Occasionally.
May 27 22:04:08 <Iowan>	DrDogwelder:  I try not to spam the list TOO often
May 27 22:04:14 <f0o>	godbyk: tell me about yourself friend
May 27 22:04:46 <godbyk>	Not too much to tell. I'm currently a PhD student at ISU studying human-computer interaction.
May 27 22:05:36 <paultag>	godbyk, oh shit!
May 27 22:05:55 <paultag>	godbyk, I'm doing research with human interfaces to my other research on swarms
May 27 22:06:05 <godbyk>	Cool.
May 27 22:06:07 <paultag>	godbyk, I've been looking for someone to snag some input from :D
May 27 22:06:13 <godbyk>	Uh oh! :)
May 27 22:06:14 <paultag>	( no pun intended )
May 27 22:06:17 <paultag>	:P
May 27 22:06:34 <paultag>	godbyk, poke me if you have a few minutes sometime :)
May 27 22:06:42 <godbyk>	What're you doing with swarms? And where does the human interface come into play?
May 27 22:06:51 <godbyk>	You can ping me whenever.
May 27 22:06:55 <godbyk>	If I'm around, I'll respond.
May 27 22:07:21 <godbyk>	(I'm around more often than not, but I've started a new research project recently, so my schedule's a bit up in the air right now.)
May 27 22:07:23 <paultag>	godbyk, I do work in Decentralized Algorithms and Emergent Behavior -- lately I've been using swarms of swarms ( sounds absurd, I know ) and providing a human interface to the "top" level
May 27 22:07:29 <paultag>	aye :)
May 27 22:07:50 <paultag>	godbyk, and that top level will manage the swarm below it ( and one more time under that ) to finish an "end goal"
May 27 22:08:02 <godbyk>	I see.
May 27 22:08:13 <paultag>	godbyk, so the idea is to take a fuzzy interface "do something like this over here" and turn that into micromanagement
May 27 22:08:18 <godbyk>	So a hierarchical, multi-agent system?
May 27 22:08:58 <paultag>	godbyk, kinda, the layers are just around so we can understand it, in theory any level can do anything any other level can do, think of it like different types of ants ( worker ants, fighter ants )
May 27 22:09:16 <godbyk>	Is each microswarm aware of the overall goal?  Or is it fed a simpler goal by its manager swarm?  What's the benefit of the hierarchy (as opposed to just throwing a ton of agents at the original problem)?
