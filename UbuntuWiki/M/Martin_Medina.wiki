My name is Martin Medina, i`m from Argentina and i`m a big fan of linux since 5 years ago. I`ve started using RedHat 5.2 (when a friend installed on my pc) and then i started to test diferent distributions. Finally, i tested debian woody and never change it. now, i have Ubuntu Linux and Debian working together at home.
