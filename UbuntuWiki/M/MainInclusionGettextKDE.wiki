== Main Inclusion Report for gettext-kde ==

 0. ''Availability:'' 
** Available in universe, all platforms http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/g/gettext-kde/

** This is a patched old version of gettext used by KDE.  Discussions with Carlos and myself decided it was best to use this version, recommended by KDE, rather than try and patch current gettext for KDE.  It should go away with KDE 4.
** required by all KDE packages for .pot generation needed by Rosetta

** no CVEs that affect xgettext, 1 setuid security issue http://bugs.debian.org/28850
 0. ''Quality assurance:''  
** gettext is already in main
 0. ''Standards compliance:'' 
** The package meets the FHS and the Debian Policy except for lacking a manpage

 0. ''Dependencies:''
** None
