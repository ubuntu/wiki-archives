 16:06:04 <SpamapS> #topic Review ACTION points from previous meeting

 16:06:11 <SpamapS> smoser follow up on bug 1028453

 16:06:13 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1028453 in ubuntu-meta (Ubuntu) "Quantal Ubuntu Server minimal install oversized" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1028453

 16:06:15 <arosales> SpamapS: thanks :-)

 16:06:21 <SpamapS> arosales update IRCComands for Quantal dev

 16:06:26 <arosales> done

 16:06:30 <SpamapS> arosales to follow up with hggdh and QA team on Server IRC contact

 16:07:13 * hggdh pops up & pays attention

 16:07:15 <smoser> i poked  a bit on that. it really seems like test case issue/assumption

 16:07:34 <hggdh> I agree. But the size grew, no matter what

 16:07:36 <smoser> its too big because we're not getting the '-virtual' kernel installed.

 16:07:44 <smoser> but i'm not sure what lead to that.

 16:07:53 <smoser> well, its somehwere in the kernel transition

 16:08:01 <smoser> but it really seemed like they did that right when i looked a bit.

 16:08:03 <arosales> hggdh: hello, to confirm are you the correct contact for QA for our weekly meetings here?

 16:08:07 <hggdh> there is no -virtual anymore. And there is the additional -extras package

 16:08:11 <SpamapS> smoser: so, carry forward?

 16:08:14 <smoser> anyway, at least a significant portion of "too big" is due to kernel.

 16:08:17 <smoser> sure.

 16:08:19 <smoser> carried.

 16:08:25 <SpamapS> #action smoser follow up on bug 1028453

 16:08:25 * meetingology smoser follow up on bug 1028453

 16:08:26 <hggdh> arosales: yes, indeed. Was on holiday until yesterday

 16:08:27 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1028453 in ubuntu-meta (Ubuntu) "Quantal Ubuntu Server minimal install oversized" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1028453

 16:08:52 <SpamapS> arosales to update events to include CFP

 16:08:56 <arosales> hggdh: as was I :-). Just wanted to confirm :-)

 16:08:56 <SpamapS> I see thats done in the agenda :)

 16:09:12 <SpamapS> #topic Quantal Development

 16:09:29 <arosales> SpamapS: I am also going to work on building out a wiki table that folks can update, but start with at least a reminder in the agenda.

 16:09:40 <SpamapS> cool

 16:09:55 <arosales> hggdh: thanks for all the server QA help :-)

 16:09:57 <SpamapS> Release Bugs - http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/ubuntu-server/release-bugs.html

 16:10:12 <SpamapS> https://launchpad.net/bugs/1040033

 16:10:14 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1040033 in qemu-kvm (Ubuntu Quantal) "Fresh VM installs via preseeded oneiric isos sometimes fail with filesystem issues" [Critical,Triaged]

 16:10:19 <SpamapS> unassigned

 16:10:55 <SpamapS> https://launchpad.net/bugs/1025203

 16:10:56 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1025203 in quantum (Ubuntu) "Trying to overwrite '/etc/quantum/plugins/openvswitch/ovs_quantum_plugin.ini', which is also in package quantum-server" [High,Fix committed]

 16:11:07 <SpamapS> zul: all good for next upload?

 16:11:17 <zul> SpamapS:  working on it now

 16:11:56 <SpamapS> hallyn: the qemu-kvm one seems like something maybe you'd be interested in?

 16:12:08 <SpamapS> https://launchpad.net/bugs/1028453

 16:12:09 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1028453 in ubuntu-meta (Ubuntu) "Quantal Ubuntu Server minimal install oversized" [High,Confirmed]

 16:12:19 <SpamapS> already discussed

 16:12:38 <SpamapS> https://launchpad.net/bugs/995285

 16:12:39 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 995285 in nova (Ubuntu Quantal) "if /etc/sudoers.d/nova_sudoers is removed, upgrades fail" [Low,Triaged]

 16:13:06 <SpamapS> somebody should probably take ownership of that

 16:13:08 <SpamapS> zul: ?

 16:13:10 <SpamapS> adam_g: ?

 16:13:17 <adam_g> SpamapS: gimme

 16:13:20 <adam_g> ill assign myself

 16:13:24 <SpamapS> werd

 16:13:31 <SpamapS> https://launchpad.net/bugs/1024281

 16:13:33 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1024281 in python-glanceclient (Ubuntu) "Bug during installation. conflicts: python-glanceclient + glance-client" [Undecided,Confirmed]

 16:13:43 <zul> daviey said he was going to do that

 16:14:01 <SpamapS> adam_g: That sounds like 'Critical' ?

 16:14:30 <SpamapS> https://launchpad.net/bugs/1044229

 16:14:32 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1044229 in maas (Ubuntu) "DHCP config doesn't get written unless an inhuman combination of scripts is run" [Undecided,New]

 16:15:10 * SpamapS feels like Ben Stein

 16:15:15 <SpamapS> anyone? anyone?

 16:15:51 <SpamapS> at least lets triage it before we put it on our release tracking

 16:16:07 <adam_g> SpamapS: RE glanceclient, i was waiting on upstream to determine how they're going to handle the migration between clients. since it appears not high on their list, i'll see about pulling the trigger in our packaging and making the migration in ubuntu the default

 16:16:27 <SpamapS> adam_g: sweet

 16:17:03 <SpamapS> unless somebody wants to bring up any other bugs, we'll move on to BP's

 16:17:16 <jamespage> o/

 16:17:33 <jamespage> actually I do want to bring something up about release tracking bug

 16:17:37 <SpamapS> bring it

 16:18:04 <jamespage> we are a little out of alignment with the report that the release team are using for tracking bugs

 16:18:06 <jamespage> http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-q-tracking-bug-tasks.html

 16:18:21 <jamespage> there is a specific server section; I have been reviewing over the last few days

 16:18:51 <jamespage> basically anything with a quantal task in the ubuntu-server packageset gets on that list

 16:19:26 <SpamapS> That seems more natural

 16:19:27 <jamespage> really a FYI for the moment; we need to figure out how to align the two things (which I will pickup)

 16:20:09 <arosales> jamespage: perhaps integration with Ursinha new bug reports?

 16:20:15 <SpamapS> #action jamespage to look into aligning release team and server team trackign reports

 16:20:15 * meetingology jamespage to look into aligning release team and server team trackign reports

 16:20:16 <jamespage> maybe

 16:20:19 <jamespage> ta

 16:20:21 <arosales> I guess these bugs are more tag related

 16:20:30 <arosales> jamespage: thanks for brining this up

 16:20:40 <SpamapS> These bugs here all need addressing or they wouldn't have a quantal task

 16:21:36 <SpamapS> http://launchpad.net/bugs/1027154

 16:21:37 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1027154 in maas (Ubuntu Quantal) "Unable to look up a node based on mac address" [High,Triaged]

 16:21:45 <SpamapS> That probably needs an assignee

 16:22:01 <SpamapS> http://launchpad.net/bugs/967410

 16:22:02 <ubottu> Launchpad bug 967410 in samba (Ubuntu Quantal) "Windows clients cannot connect to shared printers " [High,Confirmed]

 16:22:07 <SpamapS> that too

 16:22:17 <jamespage> SpamapS, I'm on that - its not actually confirmed IMHO

 16:22:22 <SpamapS> Ahh ok

 16:22:34 <SpamapS> yeah I'm not going to worry about New's or less than High then

 16:23:06 <zul> jamespage: <-- loves samba

 16:23:13 * jamespage falls off his chair

 16:23:17 <SpamapS> a lot of the juju bugs there were opened as quantal tasks assuming juju would re-try for main in quantal so they can probably be 'wont fixed'

 16:23:36 <SpamapS> shall we move on to BP's?

 16:23:50 <jamespage> OK - as this is a new list that not everyone will have looked at please can I suggest people take a look

 16:23:56 <jamespage> SpamapS, please do

 16:24:15 <SpamapS> #link http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-q-tracking-bug-tasks.html

 16:24:19 <SpamapS> so it is remembered

 16:24:22 <SpamapS> http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-q-tracking-bug-tasks.html

 16:24:28 * SpamapS does not know how to work the bot

 16:24:30 <SpamapS> ok

 16:24:38 <SpamapS> Blueprints - http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-quantal/ubuntu-server.html

 16:25:05 <arosales> Looks like we have gone into the red for servercloud-q blueprints

 16:25:11 <arosales> #link http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-quantal/group/topic-quantal-servercloud-overview.html

 16:25:26 <SpamapS> Yeah its time to start hammering on the postponed

 16:25:37 <arosales> SpamapS: should we quickly go over the high/essentials in the red?

 16:25:38 <SpamapS> do it now so people don't hold out hope :)

 16:25:53 <SpamapS> http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-quantal/group/topic-quantal-servercloud-hardening.html

 16:25:54 <arosales> +1 be nice to let folks know what wont be landing

 16:26:04 <SpamapS> That one in particular needs a lot

 16:26:34 <SpamapS> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-bug-triage-review

 16:26:56 <SpamapS> Ursinha: ^^ Perhaps some of these aren't going to happen?

 16:27:18 <jamespage> sorry - that one is a little stalled ATM - Ursinha and I have been looking at bugs/fixes to the gravity reports to replace everything

 16:29:05 <arosales> Daviey: zul: adam_g: openstack blueprints progressing ok?

 16:29:16 <arosales> 27% https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-openstack-qa

 16:29:20 <zul> i think so...ill update them today if they need to

 16:29:33 <arosales> 36% https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-openstack-folsom

 16:29:52 <arosales> 24% https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-openstack-stable

 16:30:21 <arosales> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-openstack-deployment-on-arm

 16:30:27 <arosales> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-openstack-ha

 16:30:44 <arosales> I know a lot of these have to land later in the cycle

 16:31:03 <arosales> ARM on openstack looks to be coming along.

 16:32:38 <arosales> SpamapS: I think we are going to work on trying to sync up with the juju team on https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-juju-charms-release-policy

 16:32:59 <arosales> utlemming: how is https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-jenkins-cloud-builder progressing?

 16:33:11 <utlemming> arosales: 100%

 16:33:13 <arosales> I think the initial build server is live, correct?

 16:33:25 <arosales> utlemming:  blueprint @ 44% though

 16:33:25 <SpamapS> arosales: the release policy stuff is in progress.. I'm not worried about those last items getting done

 16:33:37 <arosales> SpamapS: ok, thanks.

 16:33:39 <utlemming> arosales: just changed

 16:33:57 <arosales> utlemming: ok, thanks.

 16:34:16 <arosales> SpamapS: you also feel ok about https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-juju-charm-best-practices

 16:34:59 <m_3> I think we nailed a lot of that week before last... somebody's gotta update the bp

 16:35:02 <arosales> SpamapS: as well as https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-juju-charm-unit-tests

 16:35:38 <arosales> hallyn: you feel comfortable with https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-lxc for beta1?

 16:35:40 <m_3> arosales: biggest prob with that bp atm is a vague "unit tests for flagship charms"...

 16:35:54 <SpamapS> arosales: for the most part yes. I need to sync back up with everybody on the unit tests, but I think its basically ready.

 16:36:03 <arosales> SpamapS: ok

 16:36:10 <hallyn> looking

 16:36:26 <arosales> m_3: ya we just defined the flagship charms . .

 16:36:32 <arosales> m_3 a unit test is a unit test, correct

 16:36:43 <hallyn> arosales: yes.  i will postpone user namespaces doc item

 16:36:45 <arosales> or was that additional testing for those flagship charms

 16:36:52 * arosales will follow up with m_3 offline

 16:36:58 <arosales> hallyn: thanks for taking a look

 16:37:06 <arosales> and last one

 16:37:17 <arosales> smoser: you feel ok with https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-q-cloud-init-utils for beta2?

 16:37:31 <arosales> I guess beta 2 gives us some more time.

 16:37:38 <m_3> arosales: was embedded '/tests' for each charm

 16:38:05 <arosales> m_3: gotcha, so getting some more tests for those "flagship" charms.

 16:38:21 <arosales> perhaps just getting one test for a good charm would be a good example for that work item

 16:38:41 <arosales> SpamapS: sorry to highjack, back to you.

 16:39:26 <SpamapS> arosales: oh no, thank *you*

 16:39:32 <m_3> arosales: will update accordingly.. .thanks

 16:39:36 <SpamapS> #topic Ubuntu Server Team Events

 16:41:00 <SpamapS> CloudOpen was great

 16:41:15 <SpamapS> attendance felt a bit light..

 16:41:29 <arosales> hmm interesting

 16:41:33 <arosales> jimbaker also said he got good interest at the UCAR Seminar

 16:41:36 <SpamapS> but lots of smart people there

 16:41:49 <SpamapS> discovered this: http://linux-ha.org/source-doc/assimilation/html/index.html .. which is cool

 16:41:56 <SpamapS> Anyway, CFP's.. anybody?

 16:42:19 <SpamapS> I think September may be light on events

 16:42:23 <SpamapS> everybody heading back to school and all

 16:42:38 <m_3> btw, linuxplumbers went off without a hitch... driven by juju!

 16:42:38 <arosales> I think folks already submitted some papers for surge

 16:42:45 <SpamapS> m_3: right!

 16:42:45 <arosales> m_3: woot!

 16:42:53 <arosales> m_3:  thanks for helping charm that and keep it going

 16:43:19 * m_3 fleshed out some more "juju in production" best practices from it

 16:43:23 <hggdh> \o

 16:44:07 <hggdh> since I just returned from a long holiday, and am also with a sinus & throat infection, I do not have anything to show right now. But I DO accept questions :-)

 16:45:54 <SpamapS> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb)

 16:46:01 <smb> Since I have been on conferences last week there isn't much I think to be reported here. smoser and me would discuss the cd size issue later on. Are there questions/issues others want to bring up?

 16:46:04 <smb> ..

 16:46:41 <SpamapS> smb: craving one of those california burritos yet? ;-)

 16:46:54 <SpamapS> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions regarding Ubuntu ARM Server (rbasak)

 16:46:59 <smoser> smb, i'll ping you in a bit

 16:47:04 <rbasak> Nothing new to report. Any questions for me?

 16:47:23 <smb> SpamapS, I did not have too many of them, so I am not to bad. :)
