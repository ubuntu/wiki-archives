Hi, this is my new wiki page!

Because Ubuntu-cl is migrating to Ubuntu.com, now we have a lot of people to show our work.

Well, as you can see my name is Mauricio Peñaloza, i'm a Computer Engineer, and a fan of Linux. I've been installed many distros (included Ubuntu Warthog), but after hours searching which distro select for me, i return to Ubuntu with the Feisty Fawn (7.04). Then i signed de CoC and now i'm working as "Ubuntero" at Ubuntu-cl.

==== Me and "egne" (ñ) ====
As you can see my last name is Peñaloza, but the camel, don't accept this, by the moment, i put a double "n".

I'm not very good with english, but i do as possible as i can to make me understand (this include a course).

Saludos.

==== Para el resto de la gente ====
Hola, soy Mauricio Peñaloza, soy informatico y un adicto a Ubuntu, he probado muchas distros, pero desde Feisty Fawn, decidí quedarme con Ubuntu. Firme el código de conducta y ahora estoy trabajando duro en la comunidad de Ubuntu-cl.

Como ven mi apellido es Peñaloza, pero como en camel, no es posible colocar esa letra, yo la reemplazo por un a doble "n".

=== My Work on Ubuntu ===
Since July 2007, i'm working on Chilean Forum <nowiki>[[http://foros.ubuntu-cl.org]]</nowiki>. On May 2008 AlvaroOlivares and me take the forum administration.

From July 2008 to June 2009 i was part of Ubuntu Chilean Council. I like talk to the people that's why if there is an opportunity to be in a stand "I'll be there". But it doesn't mean that i do everything. If you like to go with me, much better will be.

From time to time i work making translations on Launchpad :-).

On November 17th, 2008 i was recognized as an Ubuntu Member for all my time working here. It was a special moment that i never forget, now i can tell to everybody: "You only have to do your job".

Now, with more responsabilities on my actual job, i have less time in the forum, then i put it under CarlosCuevas administration (Good Luck Chucky!!). But the work on Ubuntu doesn't stop, and on May 26th, 2009 i was named as the new LoCoTeamContact of Ubuntu-cl (a great responsability, but a great chance).

==== The Biggest Project ====
On August 2008, i take a big project, make a Spanish Ubuntu Course with Moodle plataform (we know about other project, but are more technical), you can see them on <nowiki>[[http://www.edicionlibre.cl]]</nowiki>. This project was an idea of <nowiki>[[http://www.educalibre.cl|Werner Westermann]]</nowiki> and i want give public thanks for all the trust that he gave us.

==== A Real Adventure ====
There is a quote that says:''En casa del herrero cuchillo de palo'' (''In blacksmith's house, wood knife''), well until november 2008 nobody excepts me uses Ubuntu on my family. Now my mom learn to use a computer, she takes my PC and starts to use them. She's exploring a new world, now she has an e-mail account and i really have to understand all the concepts like desktop, window and button to teach her.

=== What i want for Ubuntu ===
==== In my country ====
Chile has not too much penetration of free software culture, but i think that Ubuntu can do the difference. Our LoCoT is trying to stay on every opportunity. Now we want to follow if it's possible, the evolution of every pc installed to see where we have to put our efforts.
