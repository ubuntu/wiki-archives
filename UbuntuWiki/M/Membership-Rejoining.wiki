== Why is there a rejoining process? ==

If you became an Ubuntu Member directly via the Ubuntu Membership Board in the past but let your membership expire, instead of reapplying to be a member, you can answer a few simple questions about your future involvement in Ubuntu. This is to ensure that you are still interested in Ubuntu and that you still plan on contributing to the project.

== When do I need to follow this process? ==

If you left the team '''less than one month''' ago, then just send a simple email asking to be re-activated, no questions will be asked, and the process described in this page does not apply.

If you were previously an Ubuntu Member and you left the team '''more than one month''' ago, you need to go through this process to reaffirm your Ubuntu membership.

If your membership expired '''more than one year''' ago, we will wish to re-evaluate you all over again.  Please sign yourself up for one of <nowiki>[[Membership-Boards|Boards]]</nowiki>, following the <nowiki>[[Membership-NewMember|new application]]</nowiki> process.

== What is the process? ==

Answer the following questions in <nowiki>[[mailto:ubuntu-membership-boards@lists.ubuntu.com|an email to the Ubuntu Membership Board]]</nowiki> (preferibely GPG-signed):

<pre>
When did you originally become an Ubuntu Member and when did your membership expire or leave the team?
(Please provide a link to your wiki and Launchpad pages.)

Before and during the duration of your Ubuntu Membership, how did you contribute to the project?
Do you plan on contributing the same way as before, and if not, how will your contributions differ?

Why did you leave the team or let your membership expire in the first place?
What has changed that makes you want to contribute again and what steps have you taken towards doing so?
Can we help in any way?
</pre>

Your answers do not have to be long or detailed, but should accurately address the questions.

After your email has been sent, a member of the board will send you a response that we have received it. From there, provided that no members of the board have any questions, we will re-add you to the Launchpad team, thus reinstating you as an Ubuntu Member.

If you prove that you have made steady contributions in that time, then no further action needs to be taken by us. Welcome back. :)

However, if we do not receive a response to that email within a sufficient period of time, or you have not sufficiently contributed to the project in that time, we will ask you to go through <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/NewMember|the Ubuntu Membership process]]</nowiki> again.
