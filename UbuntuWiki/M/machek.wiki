=== About Me ===

Hi all,
My name is Viktor Machek, I'm 36 years working with Linux since 1999. I use Ubuntu since version 6.10, but the first introduction took place already with version 5.
I work as an IT manager in a multinational IT company and my personal interest is to promote Ubuntu. So I wanted in my work with the Ubuntu team to focus on marketing and promotion of Ubuntu.

=== Contributions ===

So far I have focused solely on translations of selected programs and meeting with Ubuntu LoCo Czech team, where we began to prepare a marketing strategy to promote Ubuntu in the Czech Republic.

=== Future Goals ===

I would like to incorporate into the existing global marketing team and participate in the promotion of new versions of Ubuntu.

=== Testimonials ===

I met and I know with Vojtech Trefny and several other people from the Czech LoCo team.
