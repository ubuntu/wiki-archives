Releases are big. You just won’t believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big they are. I mean, you may think it’s a long haul to release a single Linux package or application, but that’s just peanuts to a Linux distribution release. Because of this, we must work our way up to it, incrementally…bit by bit…milestone by milestone...it takes a lot of Deep Thought. So with that, we formally announce Ubuntu 10.10 Release Candidate.  Codenamed "Maverick Meerkat", 10.10 continues Ubuntu's proud tradition of integrating the latest and greatest open source technologies into a high-quality, easy-to-use Linux distribution.

We consider this release candidate to be complete, stable, and suitable for testing by any user.

Ubuntu 10.10 Desktop Edition and Ubuntu 10.10 Netbook Edition continue to focus on delivering cutting edge technologies, while preserving a crisp and clean user-focused experience.

Kubuntu 10.10 merges the desktop and netbook images into one download and features a new application focused software manager.

Ubuntu 10.10 Server Edition provides even better integration of the Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud and other key features such as: Hadoop, Web2.0 workloads, and hypervisor technologies.

Ubuntu 10.10 Server for UEC and EC2 brings the power and stability of the Ubuntu Server Edition to cloud computing, whether you're using Amazon EC2 or your own Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud.

Release Candidates have also been released for several Ubuntu variants, Xubuntu, Edubuntu, Ubuntu Studio, and Mythbuntu.

In addition, there are a small number of known bugs in the release candidate that will be fixed before the Ubuntu 10.10 release, but warrant highlighting for your attention:
