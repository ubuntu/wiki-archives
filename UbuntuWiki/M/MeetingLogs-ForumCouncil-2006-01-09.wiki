05:17	ubuntugeek	Well al-rightly then.. Welcome to the first Forum council meeting.
05:17	ubuntugeek	Running late, but hey thats the way we roll :)
05:19	ubuntugeek	agenda can be found here
05:19	ubuntugeek	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ForumCouncilAgenda
05:21	ubuntugeek	ok so
05:22	ubuntugeek	Hopefully we'll build up some more people attending as this catches on :)
05:22	jdong	:) the wonders of IRC meetings
05:22	ubuntugeek	heh yeah :)
=== ubuntugeek trys to fill time with rambles
05:22	jdong	lol
05:23	ubuntugeek	Anyone here not know the purpose of the FC and wish to know the purpose?
=== forumsmatthew suggests a welcome and introduction to what the FC is
=== forumsmatthew was slow
05:23	PriceChild	ubuntugeek, first item has a lot of rambling potential :)
05:23	ubuntugeek	Yes it does
05:23	ubuntugeek	So the FC was recently setup as a governance council for the ubuntuforums.org site.
05:24	ubuntugeek	the purpose of the FC is to make decisions on forum issues and resolve conflicts etc within the forums.
05:24	ubuntugeek	whats up?
05:25	ubuntugeek	Today at the CC meeting Matthew and Mike will be hopefully elected on to the FC council giving us a 5 member team.
05:26	forumsmatthew	FYI... Matthew=me
05:26	ubuntugeek	:)
05:27	ubuntugeek	Ok lets discuss setting up forum teams. I know pricechild you are ready to roll on this idea.. what thoughts do you have
05:27	PriceChild	Well shall we start with the leadership applications?
05:27	PriceChild	make a small shortlist?
05:28	ubuntugeek	yep
05:28	ubuntugeek	I think we need to take the leadership applications and make a list for sure.
05:28	jdong	yes
05:28	forumsmatthew	are those who applied here?
05:29	Vorian_	i'll speak for jacobmp92[away]  - he's in school right now
05:29	PriceChild	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=289810
05:29	ubuntugeek	we might have to do the electing at the next time.. to give more ample time for people to attend.
05:29	jdong	forumsmatthew: let's first make a list of everyone and do one-by-one
05:29	PriceChild	that thread contains applications only
05:29	ubuntugeek	but we can get a more official list going now
05:30	jdong	shall we go down the list in order of application?
05:31	PriceChild	jdong, ok so starting with plb: http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=1695126&postcount=2
05:31	jdong	is plb present?
05:31	PriceChild	I don't think many are jd
05:32	jdong	it looks that way :-/
05:32	PriceChild	any comments on plb?
05:33	jdong	ok, different approach: who is here seeking application as a Team Leader?
05:33	forumsmatthew	this is an interesting quote from his application
05:33	jdong	so far, I see Vorian_
05:33	forumsmatthew	"the majority of my posts here are more or less rants in the Cafe and suggestions for development"
05:33	Vorian_	jdong: I'm shooting for secretary... not team leader
05:34	jdong	Vorian_: ah, ok
05:34	jdong	forumsmatthew: yeah, I saw that too
05:34	PriceChild	I'm much more impressed by Lord Illian's application which is up next http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=1695147&postcount=3
05:35	PriceChild	it is also for abs beginners against plb (and also hardware)
05:35	ubuntugeek	pricechild: I like his application as wel
05:35	ubuntugeek	well*
05:35	forumsmatthew	he's been an active member for some time and a good one as well
05:35	ubuntugeek	Anyone else have comments on him?
05:36	jdong	he looks ideal for beginners
05:36	PriceChild	Lord Illian has also made a sustained positive contribution to the forums
05:36	ubuntugeek	I'll make a list of people then we can make a finalization after we go through the list
05:36	jdong	he seems to have the motivation to help beginners
05:36	ubuntugeek	Ok i'll mark him as a candidate for beginners area
05:37	ubuntugeek	Next, we have http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=1695371&postcount=4
05:37	ubuntugeek	for beginners as well
05:37	PriceChild	jeffrc313
05:38	forumsmatthew	I think he has the potential to be a good team member
05:38	PriceChild	he's reasonably active it seems
05:38	ubuntugeek	Matthew: I agree
05:38	jdong	he's not the most active ever, but does regularly visit the forums
05:39	jdong	I find his signature... questionable though?
05:39	PriceChild	Checking his last posts though... are mostly asking for support
05:39	PriceChild	not much giving
05:39	jdong	my site: www.theironknuckle.com
05:39	jdong	"I drop science like girls be droppin' babies"
05:39	jdong	hmm
05:39	ubuntugeek	hmm yeah..
05:39	jdong	the site doesn't load
05:39	ubuntugeek	ok lets move on
05:39	ubuntugeek	http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=1695486&postcount=5
05:39	ubuntugeek	dillbertdabomb
05:40	PriceChild	didn't follow instructions on format of application :P
05:40	forumsmatthew	asks to be a member, he didn't apply for leadership
05:40	jdong	PriceChild: I was gonna say :)
05:40	forumsmatthew	"I would like to be a team member for the beginner section."
05:40	PriceChild	ah ok
05:40	ubuntugeek	dillbert is just wanted to be a team member soo
05:40	PriceChild	shall we move on
05:40	jdong	yes, doesn't seem like leader is the role he wanted
05:40	ubuntugeek	http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=1695640&postcount=6
05:40	ubuntugeek	raqball
05:41	ubuntugeek	unanswered posts area
05:41	forumsmatthew	has serious potential
05:41	jdong	I like his dedication to unanswered posts
05:41	ubuntugeek	Ok just wants to be a team member as well
05:41	forumsmatthew	looking through his posts now...
05:42	ubuntugeek	at least thats how i took his answer to the 1. question
05:42	forumsmatthew	they don't really match his application statements
05:42	jdong	ubuntugeek: it seems like he's ok with being either
05:42	ubuntugeek	or is he saying he wants to be a team leader and wants to be on a team?
05:42	ubuntugeek	ok
05:42	forumsmatthew	he didn't lie, he has just been more active other ways
05:42	jdong	ubuntugeek: all the credentials he gave seem to be leadership-oriented
05:42	forumsmatthew	mainly cafe since early November
05:43	ubuntugeek	good candidate for the answered team leader then?
05:43	PriceChild	let put him on the list? :)
05:43	jdong	wait a sec please
=== jdong still looking through the posts
05:43	PriceChild	hehe :)
05:43	jdong	seeing a lot of chatter and not much support
05:43	PriceChild	doesn't seem to be the most helpful
05:44	PriceChild	yeah
05:44	jdong	currently digging to nov 1st
05:44	ubuntugeek	jdong agreed
05:44	forumsmatthew	@jdong agreed
05:44	Bonzodog	Can I just a very slightly in-a-roundabout-way related question?
05:44	Bonzodog	+ask
05:44	ubuntugeek	lets put him on and move on we can come back to a more detailed approach after we get the list
05:44	PriceChild	!ask|Bonzodog
05:44	jdong	yeah
05:44	PriceChild	no ubotu :P
05:44	Bonzodog	Is there any plans to ressurect a team related to the UDSF?
05:45	jdong	Bonzodog: please put that on the agenda if you want it discussed
05:45	jdong	it really isn't related :)
05:45	jdong	even in the most roundabout ways
05:45	PriceChild	David Corrales  http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=1695718&postcount=7 also seems to be mainly asking to be a member
05:45	forumsmatthew	agreed
05:45	ubuntugeek	agreed
05:45	jdong	k, skip
05:45	jdong	let's process the leaders first
05:46	ubuntugeek	http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=1695911&postcount=8
05:46	PriceChild	rekahsoft http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=1695911&postcount=8
05:46	jdong	his application looks very nice
05:46	PriceChild	not many posts in abs beginners...
05:46	PriceChild	mostly in gaming and leisure / programming
05:46	ubuntugeek	mostly posts in gaming it appears
05:46	jdong	a young one, too
05:47	PriceChild	not the youngest on the list ;)
05:47	ubuntugeek	i think the people applying for a position need to be pretty active in the area
05:47	forumsmatthew	that would seem appropriate
05:47	ubuntugeek	so.. with that said lets move on to the next one
05:48	ubuntugeek	http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=1696101&postcount=9

05:49	ubuntugeek	blendmaster
05:49	Vorian_	djsroknrol is a mod on mod free
05:50	ubuntugeek	beginner forums team
05:50	jdong	Vorian_: good point, thanks for bringing it up
05:50	forumsmatthew	@Vorian_ hmm
05:50	jdong	though we need to investigate more into that
05:50	ubuntugeek	most of his posts are in the beginners area
05:50	jdong	I'd rather we not be labeling anyone by their out-of-forums affiliations
05:51	ubuntugeek	anyone have thoughts on blendmaster?
05:51	jdong	blendmaster, yet another member seeker
05:51	ubuntugeek	ah yes
05:51	PriceChild	"maybe" not all his posts are the most helpful
05:51	ubuntugeek	http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=1696468&postcount=11

05:53	PriceChild	jdong, he says active and unanswered at hte bottom of psot
05:53	ubuntugeek	"I have answered questions I know as I find them. If I am not selected, I would like to join the team that helps new users or the unanswered posts. I am applying here for team-leader of either."
05:53	jdong	oh :)
05:53	jdong	so beginners or unanswered
=== jdong braces for his next suggestion
05:53	ubuntugeek	unaswered looks good.. he seems pretty active i think
05:53	forumsmatthew	Is he still active?
05:54	jdong	let's quickly find all the leader-candidates by a high-bean count....
05:54	forumsmatthew	last post is see is from November
05:54	jdong	I'm seeing a lot of member applications so far
05:54	ubuntugeek	jdong yeah
05:54	jdong	Lord Illian is a good benchmark (in my mind) of leadership candidacy
05:54	PriceChild	kuja?
05:55	forumsmatthew	jdong: agreed
05:55	ubuntugeek	Lord Illian looks good yeah

05:56	ubuntugeek	unaswered team
05:56	ubuntugeek	jeesh i wish i could spell today lol
05:56	jdong	we should've added "give 5 examples of posts you made that best represent your identity at the forums"
05:57	PriceChild	I remember mr jacobmp92 from somewhere
05:57	jdong	ubuntugeek: I'm not doing much better; this room is 50 degrees and I'm frezing my fingers off
05:57	Vorian_	ubuntugeek: He has been a very valuable member of our loco team
05:57	PriceChild	jacobmp92 seems quite good

06:14	ubuntugeek	Vorian go for it
06:14	Vorian_	well
06:14	Vorian_	Like i said in my post
06:15	PriceChild	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=323554
06:15	Vorian_	I have gained alot from UF, and I appreciate all that I have gained
06:15	Vorian_	I want to give back in what ever way I can...
06:15	Vorian_	I am a manager by profession, and this kind of work is right up my alley
06:16	Vorian_	PLUS
06:16	Vorian_	I love Ubuntu Forums :-)
06:16	ubuntugeek	;)
06:16	jdong	Vorian_: does your schedule allow you to regularly attend Forum Council meetings?
06:16	Vorian_	I make my own schedule
06:16	jdong	ah, ideal :)
06:16	Vorian_	:)
06:16	ubuntugeek	our goal is the first tuesday of every month at 16:00 utc
06:16	ubuntugeek	ok great
06:16	ubuntugeek	Pricechild?
06:16	ubuntugeek	your up
06:16	PriceChild	Vorian_, has also got a lot of experience with helping lead the Ohio LoCo
06:17	PriceChild	When people ask me why I spend time hepling out on these forums, I normally tell them that because of the Ubuntu community, I have a completely free and feature rich computer sitting infront of me, but its more than that. Despite the reputation ubuntuforums.org has amongst a large majority of the core Ubuntu community, I'm extremely proud to have been "educated" here, and hope to give this back. Being a mod, and hopefully with this
06:17	PriceChild	position I want to help take ubuntuforums.org to the core group, further integration is only a good thing. Towards this aim, I'm part of the forum ambassadors project, and am opping a couple more channels on irc.
=== PriceChild should have corrected spelling mistakes :P

06:17	jdong	look who pre-authored his speech :)

06:17	ubuntugeek	guys i got a work meeting in 5.. shoot..
06:18	ubuntugeek	jodng? thoughts
06:18	jdong	hmm
=== PriceChild posts vorian's to matthew also
06:19	jdong	both of you are well qualified for the job
06:19	PriceChild	lol he's gone again...
06:19	PriceChild	poor matthew
06:20	Vorian_	PriceChild: arm wrestle?
06:21	ubuntugeek	I think the fairest route will be to give vorian a +1. He isn't a staff member (pricey already has fun) and this will allow for some new blood to get on the team.
=== Vorian_ does a backflip
06:22	jdong	+1, ubuntugeek; in addition a non-staff secretary has the added benefit of neutrality
06:22	PriceChild	woo go Vorian_ :)
06:22	forumsmatthew	He's also been around for a long time and has a good feel
=== Vorian_ does a backflip again!
06:22	forumsmatthew	+1
06:22	ubuntugeek	great
06:22	ubuntugeek	ok settled
06:22	Vorian_	thanks guys!
06:22	ubuntugeek	ok the last thing on the agenda
06:22	frodon	congrats Vorian_ ;)
06:22	ubuntugeek	from Henrik
06:22	ubuntugeek	henrik you here?
06:22	Vorian_	frodon: thanks :)
06:22	PriceChild	ping heno,
06:22	jdong	heno: ping, you're up :)
06:22	ubuntugeek	Cause i gotta fly in like 1 minutes
06:23	ubuntugeek	jdong. matthew can you guys finish up?
06:23	forumsmatthew	yes
06:23	ubuntugeek	i'll post the notes later on
06:23	jdong	ubuntugeek: sure thing
06:23	ubuntugeek	thanks guys
06:23	heno	Just introducing myself really :)
06:23	jdong	heno: we'd love to hear :)
06:23	heno	I'd love to see some involvement from forum mods/leaders in the ISO testing of Herd 2
06:24	heno	starting this week
06:24	heno	(we think)
06:24	jdong	ok
06:24	jdong	what can we do to help with the ISO testing?
06:24	heno	And generally you can contact me with development related items
06:25	heno	jdong: see http://www.ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=201
06:25	jdong	viewing it right now
06:25	heno	I'd like help in collating the test data as it comes in
06:26	heno	It might be just a few testers or a whole flood, who knows ;)
06:26	jdong	first we need to get the word out more prominently
06:26	heno	I also look forward to working with the Forum Ambassadors when they get going
06:26	jdong	I don't think many people will find or look for that particular subforum
06:26	heno	jdong: agreed
06:26	jdong	forumsmatthew, PriceChild, staff, how should we go about it?
06:27	jdong	the forums will have a large base of users willing to conduct such testing
06:27	heno	It needs to be promoted, but a slow, rolling start is OK too
06:27	heno	so we can figure out the mechanics of collating the data
06:27	heno	we need to be able to trust the results also ...
06:28	jdong	I'm currently reading the testing howto
06:28	jdong	does testing require the instalation of ubuntu from the candidate ISO's
06:28	jdong	or just booting them up and making sure they function
06:29	heno	usually, yes
06:29	jdong	ok
06:29	heno	testing the Live CD is just the simplest test
06:29	jdong	heno: first, I think the testing how-to needs to be tweaked a bit to be simpler to understand
06:29	heno	installation (in various ways) is important
06:29	jdong	exactly what is being asked
06:30	heno	the one in the forum, or wiki (or both)?
06:30	jdong	the one in the forum
06:30	jdong	make it more clear what you want users to do in order to be helpful
06:30	jdong	i.e. "find a spare computer that you can do ubuntu installations on, etc"
06:30	heno	btw, also see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/Current
06:31	heno	the current test results page
06:31	heno	right, I see. good point
06:31	jdong	right now, the documents are pretty easy to understand for developers
06:31	forumsmatthew	I think if you make it clear for people who are not used to doing this sort of thing
06:31	forumsmatthew	how to do it
06:31	forumsmatthew	you will get some good volunteers
06:31	jdong	right
06:32	heno	ok, cool
06:32	forumsmatthew	most forums members are new at this sort of thing
06:32	forumsmatthew	but want to help
06:32	forumsmatthew	they just don't know how
06:32	forumsmatthew	give clear steps and I think they will come
06:32	heno	great, ok. I'll fix that
06:32	jdong	we'd be glad to allow you to post a linking thread in a prominent area of the forum whenever testing is requested
06:32	jdong	just right now, I think you'll get a lot of "huh?" and not much useful input
06:33	heno	is there any other place we should post a basic introduction
06:33	jdong	an introduction paragraph explaining in easy to understand terms of what ISO testing is, why it needs to be done, and what it involves from the user
06:33	heno	the Cafe or something?
06:33	jdong	would be nice for the howto
06:33	heno	right
06:33	forumsmatthew	I agree: howto
06:33	jdong	heno: revise the testing how-to to be an easy-to-understand document
06:34	jdong	with a quick summary at the top so users can quickly determine if they want to do it or not
06:34	heno	yep, ok
06:34	heno	thanks, good feedback
06:34	jdong	then, every time a candidate CD rolls out, you can post a "ISO Testers Required" post in, say, the cafe, linking to that howto
06:35	jdong	or perhaps such postings would be more appropriate in the Feisty Fawn development forum
06:35	heno	Yes, I'm already a bit active there
06:35	forumsmatthew	I think the development forum is the place where you are most likely to find people interested
06:35	jdong	(http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=179)
06:36	forumsmatthew	but an announement in the cafe with a link to the howto couldn't hurt
06:36	heno	It also helps if they have some Linux familiarity too
06:36	PriceChild	We really need to make the dev forum useful....
06:36	jdong	right
06:36	heno	so they can file good bug reports with logs, etc
06:36	PriceChild	edgy's was great but feisty's been a bit pants... a project like this would help loads :)
06:36	jdong	heno: you can request any level of experience you think appropriate, just make it clear what you expect from testers please :)
06:36	jdong	I also noticed this from heno: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=333915
06:37	jdong	some of that should probably be expanded or updated
06:37	jdong	i.e. AFAIK new specs aren't gonna be accepted for feisty anymore
06:37	jdong	bug reporting, triaging, and testing ISO images should be expanded a bit
06:38	heno	or reworded, rather
06:38	jdong	with more info on what would be helpful
06:38	jdong	and in the case of triaging, how to go about it
06:38	heno	(I posted it just yesterday)
06:38	heno	the point is basically that there is little point suggesting new features now
06:39	heno	but you can always start on a spec for Feisty+1
06:39	jdong	right
06:39	heno	I should make that more clear
06:39	jdong	say that bluntly :)
06:39	heno	ok
06:39	jdong	also, reword the bug triaging stuff to be a bit more 'threatening'
06:39	heno	IN THE FORUM THINGS NEED TO BE SAID BLUNTLY I get it ;)
06:39	jdong	more to the likening of "if you don't help us find these bugs, don't cry about the bugs on release day"
06:40	jdong	;-)
06:40	PriceChild	come on you're a dev heno, you should know that already ;)
06:40	heno	I've lived in England too long :)
06:40	jdong	in any communicatons medium, people will skim and read with ADHD
06:40	heno	yeah, need to sharpen my terseness a bit
06:40	PriceChild	big bold red writing helps I find :P
06:40	jdong	heno: at one point my backports guidelines were bumped to size-108 fonts
06:41	jdong	because nobody would freakin listen :)
06:41	heno	heh, ok
06:42	heno	right, I think that's all from me for now
06:42	jdong	heno: and whenever you see the forums having unholy behavior (using the forums as a bug tracker, posting unsafe checkinstalled debs or other unsafe instructions, etc) please let us know :)
06:42	jdong	we'd like to keep that sort of behavior controlled
06:42	heno	I'll check in on these meetings regularly
06:42	jdong	don't be afraid to use the Report Posts button when you see stuff like that, heno
06:42	heno	right, ok
06:43	heno	I might apply for mod rights in the feisty forum too
06:43	heno	(as I have in the ISO testing forum)
06:43	jdong	heno: right now we have technical issues with vbulletin and making limited-mods
06:43	jdong	heno: you say you have mod access in iso testing?
06:43	heno	yes
06:43	jdong	ok, perhaps things have changed :)
06:43	heno	and I've used it sucessfully
06:44	jdong	I +1 your mod rights to feisty forum
06:44	jdong	ubuntugeek will have to apply that when I talk to him later
06:44	jdong	ok, that takes care of the official agenda
06:44	heno	right
06:44	jdong	right?
06:44	PriceChild	jdong, could we also maybe have the forum council subforum on the frontpage?
06:44	vorian_	according to the wiki yes
06:45	jdong	PriceChild: that's stuff you talk to Ryan about :D
06:45	PriceChild	hehe ok
06:45	jdong	I don't like touching that part of admincp :D
06:45	PriceChild	will ask him later
06:45	jdong	there is one more thing I'd like to take this time to discuss....
06:45	PriceChild	jdong, what do you touch? ;)
06:45	jdong	PriceChild: I spent a good portion of yesterday reading vbulletin documentation
06:45	jdong	so I'm getting better darnit :)
06:46	vorian_	lol
06:46	PriceChild	he he i was only joking sorry :)
06:46	jdong	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=330230
06:46	jdong	we still have this unaddressed res center thread
06:46	jdong	regarding where to draw the line with spamming
06:47	vorian_	it is borderline....
06:47	jdong	vorian_ indeed it is, but in this case the user seems to have good intentions at heart
06:47	jdong	and from that thread, he is cooperative
06:47	vorian_	agreed, I see no self promotion
06:48	vorian_	it is for the betterment of ubuntu
06:48	jdong	currently we have very weak/vague guidelines as to advertising vs spam
06:48	jdong	"If a thread is spam it will be moved to the forum jail."
06:49	vorian_	what about community market
06:49	vorian_	?
06:49	jdong	vorian_ that says "please do not spam" :D
06:49	PriceChild	I think its best we leave it to staff's discression
06:49	jdong	aye, I think it should be left at the staff's discretion
=== vorian_ sorry
06:50	jdong	I was thinking obtaining staff approval too
06:50	jdong	particularly low-bean-count people
06:50	heno	Perhaps let him re-post a slightly altered version, say without the '$$$'
06:51	heno	at some clause about good taste to border-line spam case decisions
06:51	heno	add, rather
06:51	jdong	right
06:51	jdong	I'm all for allowing tousimis to continue with his service
06:53	PriceChild	I'm happy with him also
06:54	jdong	so far I'm gonna reply to him that (1) He may continue promoting/developing/offering his service (2) Spam vs not spam decisions will be made on a per-case basis at the discretion of the staff member handling the thread (3) If you have low-bean count it's helpful to first clear it by PM'ing an administrator or staff member
06:54	jdong	any objections?
06:54	PriceChild	in addition to no. 1
06:54	PriceChild	the promoting in the appropriate subforum
06:55	PriceChild	and signature
06:55	jdong	(marketplace?)
06:55	PriceChild	yup
06:56	jdong	what currently happens when a user is banned?
06:56	jdong	are they unable to log in?
06:57	PriceChild	depends on the type of ban?
06:57	jdong	spam infractions?
06:57	PriceChild	that's just a ban on the name
06:57	jdong	the OP seems to state that he couldn't read his PM's?
06:57	jdong	once he was banned
06:57	PriceChild	yeah
06:57	jdong	heh
06:57	PriceChild	when you log in because of spam infraction you can't see aything
06:58	jdong	can you see your infraction notices
06:58	PriceChild	jdong, http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=332163
06:58	PriceChild	Nope
06:58	jdong	and can you contact staff members for a rebuttal?
06:58	PriceChild	vorian_, sorry but you can't see that link
06:58	PriceChild	No
06:58	jdong	uhm, lovely :)
06:58	PriceChild	jdong, my issues with it were outlined int hat thread :)
06:58	vorian_	PriceChild: :)
06:59	jdong	ok
06:59	jdong	I think we need to refine the behavior of infraction-based bans
06:59	PriceChild	uip
06:59	jdong	but at a later meeting when all staff members are present
06:59	jdong	it simply doesn't make sense at the moment
06:59	PriceChild	jdong, arg rav tux has changed his avatar again lol :P
07:00	vorian_	hehe
07:00	PriceChild	ubuntugeek mentioned making another meeting within a week or two because of the approval of matthew and mikeb
07:00	PriceChild	we can sort things out then :)
07:02	PriceChild	So....
=== jdong still typing out a flowery version of what he said
07:03	vorian_	jdong: Does this council have a launchpad entry?
07:03	jdong	vorian_: err i dont know :D
07:03	jdong	lol
07:03	vorian_	hehe
07:03	jdong	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1989441#post1989441 , my response
07:04	PriceChild	looks good :)
07:04	jdong	ok, anything further?
07:04	PriceChild	vorian_, not yet no
07:04	PriceChild	Im' happy :)
07:04	jdong	I'd like to play starcraft on my large screen
07:04	vorian_	jd
07:04	PriceChild	I'll post logs to the subforum and wiki
07:05	jdong	ok, PriceChild
07:05	jdong	and vorian_ gets to have fun too :D
07:05	PriceChild	seen as vorian_ got d/c and missed out bits :P
07:05	jdong	yep
07:05	jdong	ok, anything futher?
07:05	vorian_	PriceChild: thanks
07:05	jdong	can I bang the hammer thingie?
=== vorian_ stands in applause!
=== jdong bangs hammer
07:06	jdong	meeting is over, thanks to those who showed up and contributed
07:06	vorian_	thanks everyone!
07:06	jdong	next meeting scheduled.... err... whenever :)
07:06	vorian_	that will be a fun one
07:06	jdong	(we will likely have a follow-up meeting)
07:06	PriceChild	13th of february
07:06	PriceChild	although there'll be one inbetween
07:06	jdong	PriceChild: yeah
07:07	jdong	anyway
07:07	jdong	we can hammer out the agendas later :)
07:07	jdong	alright, starcraft time :)
