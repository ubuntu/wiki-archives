__TOC__

==== About ====

I have been an avid Linux user since around the 0.9x kernel versions.  For most of my professional career, I have made a living developing Windows software.  More recently, I have been hacking on Linux (haven't written a line of Windows code in 2 years now).

==== OSS Contributions ====

I am a long-time contributor to <nowiki>[[http://wireshark.org|Wireshark]]</nowiki> ("formerly known as Ethereal") having written the <nowiki>[[http://nfsv4.org|NFSv4]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[http://pvfs.org|Parallel Virtual File System, Version 2]]</nowiki>, and Hummingbird hclnfsd protocol dissectors.

==== Interests ====

* Python - this is my primary interest right now.  Python is a breath of fresh air after developing solely in C for many (!!!) years.
* Virtualization - I am interested to see where this is going to go in the future.  Lots of potential yet to be tapped in this area.
