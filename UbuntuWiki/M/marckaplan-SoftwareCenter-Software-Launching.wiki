__TOC__


If USC is launched by any means when it is already open, the existing instance should be focused.

=== Directly ===

In Unity, Ubuntu Software Center should be a default item in the launcher.

In the standard `gnome-panel` “Menu Bar” applet, “Ubuntu Software Center” should be the last item in the “Applications” menu, with a separator immediately before it. In the `gnome-panel` “Main Menu” applet, “Ubuntu Software Center” should similarly be after the list of application categories, with separators immediately before and after it.

When opened directly, USC should by default display the <nowiki>[[#home|home screen]]</nowiki> of the “All Software” section, scrolled to the top. The search field should be empty. Default focus should be on the <nowiki>[[#search-field|search field]]</nowiki> (so that you can start searching immediately, or use Down followed by other arrow keys to navigate the items in the home screen).

=== From an apt: link ===

Opening an `apt:` URL should launch Ubuntu Software Center directly to the appropriate screen; or if it is already open, focus it, wait until any currently-open <nowiki>[[#def-alert|alerts]]</nowiki> or <nowiki>[[#def-dialog|dialogs]]</nowiki> have been dismissed, and then switch to the appropriate screen. What that “appropriate screen” is depends on the URL and whether the package is known to exist.

If the URL is of the form “`apt:package-name`”:

* If the package is known, the <nowiki>[[#software-item|software item screen]]</nowiki> for the package. '''Test case:''' (sc-001) Follow the link <nowiki>[[http://apt.ubuntu.com/p/python-wxtools|apt:python-wxtools]]</nowiki>. It should show the item screen for “All Software” > “System” > “python-wxtools”.

* If the package is not known, an ephemeral error screen in the “All Software” section. It should be possible to return to this screen later in the <nowiki>[[#navigation-back-forward|navigation history]]</nowiki>, but it should not be possible to navigate to it directly. '''Test case:''' (sc-009) Follow the link <nowiki>[[http://apt.ubuntu.com/p/abcdefghijklmnop|apt:abcdefghijklmnop]]</nowiki>.

 <nowiki>[[File:SoftwareCenter/apturl-unknown-package.png]]</nowiki>

If the URL is of the form “`apt:package-name?minver=1.0`”:

* If the package is not known, the same kind of ephemeral error screen as used for `apt:unknown-package-name`.

* If the package is known, the <nowiki>[[#software-item|software item screen]]</nowiki> for the package. If a version late enough is not available, this screen should include an extra ribbon, between the summary and the <nowiki>[[#software-item-screen-state-installed|installation state bar]]</nowiki>: “Sorry, version {minver} isn’t available in your current software sources.”.

 <nowiki>[[File:SoftwareCenter/apturl-version-unavailable.png]]</nowiki>

If the URL is of the form “`apt:package1,package2,`…”: A <nowiki>[[#custom-list|custom package list]]</nowiki> for the package names (including displaying the comma-separated names in the <nowiki>[[#search-field|search field]]</nowiki>).

If the URL is of the form “`apt:package-name?section=multiverse`”:

* If the section is not currently enabled, a placeholder for the package screen, inviting you to enable the section. It should use the package name as its heading, the text ‘This software is available from the “{source}” source, which you are not currently using.’, and a button “Use This Source”. Activating the button should add the source, and the software item screen should automatically expand to its normal format.

 <nowiki>[[File:SoftwareCenter/apturl-channel-invitation.png]]</nowiki>

 ''Erratum: The text currently implemented is shorter and better.''

* If the section is enabled but the package is not present in it, the same ephemeral error screen as used for `apt:unknown-package-name`.

* Otherwise, the <nowiki>[[#software-item|software item screen]]</nowiki> for the package.

If the URL is of the form “`apt:package-name?channel=lucid-partner`”: Exactly the same appearance and behavior as for `apt:package-name?section=multiverse`, but enabling a whitelisted repository as listed in `/usr/share/app-install/channels/`, rather than a section.

When this feature is fully implemented, the `software-center` package should be marked as `Provides: apturl` and `Replaces: apturl`.

=== from a standalone .deb package ===

<nowiki>[[File:SoftwareCenter/software-item-screen-standalone.png]]</nowiki>

Opening a `.deb` package should launch Ubuntu Software Center (or focus it, wait until any dialogs are dismissed, and then navigate) to a temporary <nowiki>[[#software-item-screen|software item screen]]</nowiki> for the package.

In the navigation bar, the screen should be located in an “Other” source, following “All Software” or “Installed” depending on whether this package version is already installed.

This software item screen should differ from the standard one in these ways:
* Its visual design should hint that this is a little less safe than installing a package from a repository.
* The installation state bar should say “Standalone software package”, not “Free”. (For all Ubuntu Software Center knows, you might have had to pay to download the package in the first place.)
* If one of your repositories contains a package with the same name but a higher version number, there should be an extra bar below the installation state bar, with text of the form ‘Ubuntu has a newer version.’ (without quotes) or ‘“Other Repository Label” has a newer version.’ (with quotes). Activating the adjacent “Newer Version” button should navigate to the software item screen for the newer version.

The `software-center` package should be marked as `Provides: gdebi` and `Replaces: gdebi`.

=== from the command line ===

`software-center` should launch the Center to its default view. `software-center `''package-name'' should open the Center to display that package. If the package is unknown, it should display <nowiki>[[#unknown-package|the same unknown-package screen as apturl uses]]</nowiki>.
