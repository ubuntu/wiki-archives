The MissouriTeam Logo has no definition and needs ideas to help start the process.  Missouri covers quite an area with rich history that could be used in the resulting logo.

== Current ideas ==
* Lewis & Clark
* St. Louis Arch
* Blue Bird
* State Moto (The "Show Me" State)
* <nowiki>[[http://www.sos.mo.gov/symbols/default.asp|Official State items]]</nowiki>

If you have any recommendations or ideas for a team logo, feel free to post your submissions to the mailing list.

== Guidelines ==

An excerpt taken from the <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/aboutus/trademarkpolicy|Trademark Policy]]</nowiki>

''Our logos are presented in multiple colours and it is important that their visual integrity be maintained. It is therefore preferable that the logos only be used in their standard form but if you should feel the need to alter them in any way you should keep the following guidelines in mind. It should also be borne in mind that the more you wish to vary our logos from their standard form the smaller is the chance that we will be able to approve your proposed use.''

* ''If presented in multiple colours, the logo should only use the "official" logo colours.''
* ''You may use transparency and gradient/depth tools but should retain the "official" colours.''
* ''A monochrome version may be acceptable in certain situations, if the use requires it (e.g. desktop backgrounds).''
* ''Any scaling must retain the original proportions of the logo.''

You can find the official color schemes to use at <nowiki>[[Artwork/Official]]</nowiki>. Submissions can be done in any web graphic format, however the final format will be SVG.  Attached and uploaded images need be no larger than 640x480.

== Official Logo ==
The deadline for uploading your graphics will be September 1st.  A vote will be held on September 5th in IRC for the official logo.  Your artwork does not have to be final to be included with the voting.  Even if you scan something you scribbled on a napkin, it can be included.  If you need help putting your ideas down on paper, <nowiki>[[MissouriTeam/ContactUs| contact us]]</nowiki> at any time.

| <^> I've been trying to come up with something unique without being too patriotic.  The logo design in quite simple.  I took the Ubuntu Circle of Friends Tango icon and removed the extra shadow.  I took the SVG image of the state map by county and stuck with the Tango icon style.  Instead of the Tango palette, I used the colors as described in the <nowiki>[[Artwork/Official| Ubuntu Palette]]</nowiki>.

| <^> This is a rehash of the above logo but I've moved the state image in front of the CoF.

| <^> This is a quick sketch.  This isn't the final, but something we could use or incorporate in the final logo.
