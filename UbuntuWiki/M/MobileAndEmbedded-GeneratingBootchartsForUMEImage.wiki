== Generating Bootcharts for a UME Image ==

=== Creating an Image with Bootchart Enabled ===
* Launch image-creator
* Open target chroot
* In target chroot:
** `sudo apt-get update`
** `sudo apt-get install bootchart`
* Create an image and write it to a USB key
* Install the image on the USB key (or run a live image off the USB key)
* When the system has finished installing and booting, a png containing a boot chart will be generated in /var/log/bootchart
* To generate a new bootchart, simply reboot.  For example, in terminal:
** `sudo shutdown -r now`
** A new png will automatically be created in /var/log/bootchart
* Note: performing a `sudo apt-get install` on the running image itself will not work 

=== Creating an Image that Does Not Use SquashFs ===
The following steps describe how to create an image that uses ext3 for the rootfs rather than squashfs:
* Close image-creator
* Add the following line to the [installimage.menlow-lpia-ubuntu-hardy-ppa] section of ~/.image-creator/image-creator.cfg:
** `use_squashfs=0`
* Launch image-creator
* Create an Install USB image.  A Live image cannot be used as a Live image always uses squashfs.
* Write the created image to a USB key
* To verify that squashfs has been effectively disabled, make sure that the install.cfg file at the root of the usb key has the line:
** `use_squashfs=0`
* NOTE: An image that does not use squashfs will use significantly more space in the device's rw storage partition.  Be sure that the device that you are installing the image on has a large enough rw storage paritition to accomodate the uncompressed filesystem.  This usually means a rw storage partition that is > 1.3 GB.
* NOTE: Installation will take longer than usual as files need to be individually decompressed and copied to disk

=== Misc Notes ===
* Current bootchart version for hardy as of 3/20: 0.9-0ubuntu7
