=== Summary ===
When finishing the secondary school some stundents don't know what career they are going to choose. This project goal is to implement a Vocational Orientation System in Edubuntu that can offer vocational tests, personality tests and IQ tests. This program will also provide a tool for teachers to compare their students and group them according their skills and personalities.

=== Rationale ===
There are some vocational, personality and all kind of psicology tests that are in the internet and when I look in the Ubuntu repositories there was no applications that can offer this kind of help to students.

=== Use cases ===
* A student wants to know more about his/her personality and take a test to help him/her determine his/her personality type.

* A student wants to know areas of study that coincide with his skills.

* A teacher wants to see a comparative list of his students personalities and skills.

* A teacher wants to see their students IQ.

* A teacher wants to see the profile (skills, personality, etc.) of an specific student.

=== Scope ===

* '''Create Profile'''- The students will be able to create their profiles with personal information. The results of the tests will be also stored in the student's profile.

* '''Take Test and see results'''- The students will have a list of tests where they are going to be able to pick one and take it to see the results.

* '''View History'''- The students will be able to look at the results of tests they took in the past and compare them whit their new results.

* '''Create classes'''- The teachers will be able to create a class of students.

* '''View and compare profiles'''- The teachers will be able to see the students profiles and compare them.

* '''Database'''- A MySQL DataBase will store all the information about students and tests.

=== Design ===
The frontend of the program will be designed with PyGTK.

=== Implementation ===
The implementation will have the following arquitechture:

 MySQL DataBase <--|--> Python Program <--|--> PyGTK FrontEnd

==== Code ====
The program will be written in Python using the Pydev plugin for Eclipse.

=== Comments ===
Instead of MySQL how about using PostgresSQL or SQLite as backend. Wouldn't MySQL be bulkier -Shirish Agarwal
