== Main Inclusion Report for `mono-tools` ==

# ''Availability:'' Available in universe/unstable/testing, Arch: all
# ''Rationale:'' mono-tools contains the standalone monodoc browser which was shipped before by monodoc itself and a gtk frontend to nunit, a unit testing framework. Currently monodoc itself is uninstallable with only main sources because it depends on monodoc-browser.
# ''Security:'' 
** No CANs
 0. ''Quality assurance:''  
** two bugs in Debian BTS <nowiki>[[http://bugs.debian.org/src:nunit]]</nowiki> (#341287 and #342342) where the first one is fixed in universe and I can't reproduce the second one.
** upstream BTS <nowiki>[[http://bugzilla.ximian.com/buglist.cgi?product=Mono%3A+Doctools&bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED&order=bugs.bug_id|here]]</nowiki>. No critical bugs regarding the monodoc-browser.
 0. ''Standards compliance:'' 
** The package meets the FHS and the CLI policy.
 0. ''Dependencies:'' 
** <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MainInclusionReportNUnit|nunit]]</nowiki> which is currently not in main.
