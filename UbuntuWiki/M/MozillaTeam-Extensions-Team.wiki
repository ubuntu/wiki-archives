== Who we are ==
We are the team that takes care of Mozilla extensions in Ubuntu. We take care of currently packaged extensions, and prepare packages for new extensions to get them in Ubuntu archive.

== How to join ==
We need to see your contributions before joining our team. If you are considering joining the team, <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MozillaTeam/Extensions/List#head-f84cf31b6590ff2c4f296e1c5a4b1a8b8b115418|find an extension]]</nowiki> that needs a maintainer and <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MozillaTeam/Extensions/Packaging|prepare the package]]</nowiki>. We also need to see your continued contributions. Find an extension that needs an update, and <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MozillaTeam/Extensions/Packaging#head-e9ae1ac834ae52ecc9f3e1bf3a7ee2af5d1af4a7|prepare it]]</nowiki>. Once you have prepared a package and few (at least three) updates, apply for a membership.

We would like to see you as a part of our team :).
