==== About me ====

I'm from Brazil, so my English isn't my native language and, of course, it's feasible that I'll make some language mistakes. But written is the best manner to improve it. Please, don't feel intimidated in correct me, if so, I will send a postal card of nice Brazil's places, thank you :).

I am working at big telecomunication company of Brazil called Embratel. I have been managing a developer team. We've been involving in a network project manager for five years and we are using Ubuntu in our desktops to developer it. Some kinds of our server is Ubuntu too.

My graduate is on Telecomunication Engineering was finished in 1996. I got a Master title on Computer Science in 1998 at System Distributed area.
