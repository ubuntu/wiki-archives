   03:35 nomed            hi all
   03:35 jsgotangco       hi
   03:36 janimo           hi all
   03:37 freeflying       hi all
   03:37 nomed            agenda ?
   03:37 nomed            i hadn't the time to write down anything :(
   03:38 janimo           no agenda as usual :)
   03:38 jsgotangco       heh
   03:38 janimo           we can talk about anything
   03:38 janimo           like current status
   03:38 janimo           or whatever comes up
   03:38 jsgotangco       is flight 7 being baked for xubuntu?
   03:38 nomed            janimo, ok
   03:39 nomed            i can explain the current status of the icon theme
   03:39 nomed            that i would see on next release if possible
   03:39 nomed            but i guess i'm in late
   === cbx33 [n=c2df514b@mail.trinsite.co.uk] has left #ubuntu-meeting []
   03:40 nomed            i still didn't send the patch as i would get more feedbacks by xfce upstreamers
   03:40 janimo           nomed, xfce upstream seems positive about it.
   03:40 janimo           did you get in contact with tango?
   === bimberi [n=bimberi@ubuntu/member/pdpc.active.bimberi] has left #ubuntu-meeting ["Leaving"]
   03:40 nomed            as there is something that should be fixed
   03:40 janimo           jsgotangco: yes tomorrow is flight 7
   03:40 nomed            janimo, dobey is waiting
   03:40 janimo           just found out :)
   03:40 janimo           nomed: waiting for what?
   03:40 nomed            i send the patch
   03:41 nomed            but i asked to upstreamer to change some desktop files
   03:41 janimo           oh, so you're waiting for him?
   03:41 nomed            no answers about that
   03:41 nomed            solution:
   03:41 nomed            or add not-needed icons name to xl file
   03:41 nomed            and i do not like it very much
   03:41 nomed            or patch desktop files
   03:41 nomed            and i do not like it very much
   03:42 nomed            no reason for having xfce4-settings and xfce-settings-show
   03:43 nomed            same icon ...
   03:43 nomed            different name
   03:43 nomed            same app
   03:43 nomed            one is used within the desktop file the other within the menu
   03:45 nomed            janimo, same for xfprint and xfce4-printer
   03:45 nomed            and some others
   03:45 janimo           I remember that part of your mail upstream
   03:45 janimo           I guess you could sent a patch to xfce bugzilla for it
   03:45 janimo           they should apply it
   03:45 janimo           I'd not like to patch our packages too much if it can be done via upstream
   03:46 janimo           although xfprint author is busy nowadays
   03:46 nomed            janimo, absolutely yes
   03:46 nomed            ok i'll do that
   03:46 janimo           nomed: ok thanks
   03:46 nomed            i'll send patches over bugzilla
   03:46 janimo           it should not be too many sources referencing those icons
   03:46 janimo           maybe only .desktop files
   03:46 nomed            yes
   03:46 janimo           ok make sure it's against svn trunk
   03:47 janimo           since we are not quite the same
   03:47 nomed            but i 'm goinging to choose icon naming entries for them
   03:47 janimo           very close but not up to date
   03:47 janimo           sure
   03:47 nomed            it would be nice to have some serious feedbacks
   03:47 nomed            anyway they told me they 'll trust
   03:47 nomed            and i do not wait anymore
   03:47 janimo           yes
   03:48 nomed            then ...
   03:48 janimo           right the sooner the more chances we have to get them in by dapper
   03:48 nomed            for the xfce-settings-show panel|dialog or whatever you want to call it :)
   03:48 nomed            we need to choose a gtk2-theme for xubuntu
   03:49 nomed            and add gtk-icon-theme="Tango"
   03:49 nomed            or Tango-xfce or Xubuntu-icons
   03:49 nomed            or the gtk theme icons will not show up
   03:50 janimo           how does that app differ from the rest that it has these errors?
   03:50 nomed            it loads first icons
   03:50 janimo           what does it have to do with the gtk2-them?
   03:50 janimo           ah, hardcoded icons?
   03:50 nomed            more or less
   03:50 nomed            janimo, i didn't check the code
   03:51 nomed            but i've had the impression that there is something wrong on the sequence
   03:51 janimo           so does the code need to be changed (in principle) to use a specific gtk2-theme?
   03:51 nomed            janimo, not really
   03:51 janimo           I wonder how xfce devs handle this since they use othere gtk/icon themes too
   03:51 nomed            you can just add gtk-icon-theme="Foo"
   03:51 nomed            to the $HOME/gtkrc-2.0
   03:51 janimo           in the .desktop ?
   03:51 janimo           we cannot add stuff  to $HOME
   03:51 nomed            or gtkrc
   03:52 janimo           the most we can to is add default configs to /etc/xdg
   03:52 nomed            janimo, yes
   03:52 janimo           which we already do for gtk and icons theme
   03:52 janimo           clearlooks+tango
   03:52 nomed            that's why i told you we should choose a gtk2-theme
   03:52 nomed            then to that file
   03:52 nomed            "gtkrc"
   03:52 janimo           if that apps disregards these settings it need to be fixed by another approach
   03:53 nomed            we echo gtk-theme-icon=Tango
   03:53 janimo           but we should not create stuff in $HOME
   03:53 janimo           that's against  the rules
   03:53 nomed            janimo, can't we have a gtkrc theme for xubuntu ?
   03:54 janimo           nomed sure
   03:54 nomed            a debian native pkge ?
   03:54 janimo           but not put in home
   03:54 nomed            janimo, or or :)
   03:54 janimo           well is that different than the gtk engine?
   03:54 nomed            or in $HOME/gtkrc-2.0
   03:54 janimo           we have gtk2-engines-xfce already
   03:54 nomed            or in /usr/share/themes/Xubuntu/gtk-2.0/gtkrc
   === jarufe [n=jarufe@pc-155-140-104-200.cm.vtr.net] has joined #ubuntu-meeting
   03:55 janimo           nomed, packages MUST NOT touch stuff in $HOME :)
   03:55 nomed            janimo, ok :D
   03:55 janimo           the second is ok
   03:55 nomed            so /usr/share/themes/Xubuntu/gtk-2.0/gtkrc
   03:55 janimo           but I wonder if the default theme does not do that alreday
   03:55 nomed            i was just explaining all the solutions :)
   03:55 nomed            janimo, no
   03:55 nomed            it always uses Rodent icons
   03:56 nomed            even if they do not really exist
   03:56 janimo           dpkg -L gtk2-engines-xfce
   03:56 nomed            more then hardcoded
   === luzi [n=luzi@dhcp-202-53-vpn.unizh.ch] has joined #ubuntu-meeting
   03:56 janimo           there are plenty of gtkrc files there
   03:56 nomed            janimo, we'll do that just for xubuntu theme
   03:56 janimo           but none is the default rigth now
   03:56 nomed            and we'll explain how to have it working on other themes
   03:56 janimo           but the ubuntu theme is clearlooks now do you mean we change it?
   03:57 nomed            if we can't find a way to patch xfce-mcs-plugins
   03:57 janimo           I am still a bit confused by the difference between gtk engines and themes though
   03:57 nomed            janimo, ehhehe
   03:57 nomed            yep
   03:57 nomed            we'll not touch the engine
   03:57 nomed            just the theme
   03:57 janimo           the engines is code which comes with some themes which add soem touch to it
   03:57 janimo           eight?
   03:57 janimo           right?
   03:58 nomed            the engine is what the gtkrc uses
   03:58 nomed            within gtkrc you set colors for ex
   03:58 janimo           so we have the clearlooks theme set by default which I assume uses the clearlooks engine
   === janimo checks
   03:58 nomed            yes
   03:58 nomed            not the ubuntulook one
   03:58 janimo           indeed
   03:59 nomed            janimo, what you have to check is
   03:59 janimo           so we can patch one of the gtk2-engines-xfce themes to use the clearlooks engine
   03:59 nomed            /usr/share/themes/
   03:59 janimo           and tweak it to whatever it takes to get the icons right
   03:59 nomed            janimo, nhaa
   03:59 nomed            wait
   04:00 nomed            gtkrc file is what is called gtk2-theme-foo
   04:00 janimo           indeed
   === ..[topic/#ubuntu-meeting:Ubugtu] : Current meeting: Xubuntu | Calendar: http://fridge.ubuntu.com/event | Logs: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MeetingLogs/ | 04 May 02:00 UTC: Ubuntu Development Team | 09 May 20:00 UTC: Technical Board | 10 May 12:00 UTC: Edubuntu | 10 May 13:30 UTC: Xubuntu | 11 May 08:00 UTC: Ubuntu Development Team
   04:00 nomed            that depends on gtk2-engine
   04:00 nomed            we can for ex
   04:00 nomed            momdify  ubuntulooks gtkrc file
   04:00 nomed            the ubuntu default theme
   04:00 nomed            in a way it'll use the colors we like
   04:00 nomed            and add to it
   04:01 nomed            gtk-icon-theme="Tango"
   04:01 janimo           you dont't mean modify but copy and modify right? :)
   04:01 nomed            yes
   04:01 nomed            :)
   04:01 janimo           is the icon-theme part of the gtkrc??
   04:02 nomed            janimo, anyway it would be nice if source could be patched
   04:02 nomed            xfce source of xfce-settings-show
   04:02 janimo           nomed, if upstream does not answer shortly I'll look at the source
   04:02 nomed            so icon-theme doesn't need to be part of gtkrc file
   04:02 janimo           I tmay be rodent is hardcoded and that's all
   04:03 nomed            janimo, i see benny is cleaning stuff
   04:03 janimo           we have another bug (again) preferred applictaions do not have a mcs entry icon
   04:03 janimo           it used to work once
   04:03 nomed            i hope he'll find the time to check it
   04:09 janimo           anyhtng else to discuss?
   04:09 janimo           questions?
   04:09 janimo           does anyone use xubuntu here with non-english locale?
   04:10 janimo           if so is there anything that can be improved in this regard?

   04:25 nomed            janimo, is it fine for u if i patch ubuntu pckges .. <-- could u read this ?
   04:25 janimo           nope
   04:25 nomed            i was talking alone
   04:25 nomed            :)
   04:25 janimo           did not see any movement in the past 20 minutes
   04:25 janimo           :)
   04:26 nomed            yes .. i was  talking with me :D

   04:31 janimo           nomed, just bugzilla patches firts
   04:31 janimo           then I'll upload as they apply them
   04:31 janimo           as for orage plugin the panel I agree
   04:32 janimo           in the panel I mean
   04:32 janimo           I don;t think I changed anything in the mcs -lugins package but I'll check
   === strapal [n=strapal@dsl51B676F3.pool.t-online.hu] has left #ubuntu-meeting []
   04:33 janimo           nomed, I think the exec is ok there since it will mostly be called from the menu not directly from cmdline
   04:33 janimo           so /usr/lib is ok imho
   04:34 janimo           wait.
   04:34 janimo           upstream and us both install in /usr/bin
   04:34 nomed            janimo, dpkg -L orage | grep orage_plugin ?
   04:35 nomed            is it ok ?
   04:35 janimo           you mean a and .la?
   04:35 janimo           I have to delete those
   04:35 janimo           or something else?
   04:37 janimo           nomed, can you mail me these concerns?
   04:37 janimo           need to go away for a while
   04:37 janimo           thanks
