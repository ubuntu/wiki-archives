=== Agenda and minutes ===
==== Firefox 2 archive removal ====
* Topic summary: Remove Firefox 2 from the archives because is outdated and we are not able to continue providing security support
* Actions:
** Check for extensions and plugins that are not supported in Firefox 3, and remove them, if there are no updates for them
** Remove Firefox 2 from the archive

==== abrowser rdepends transition ====
* Topic summary: abrowser has its own metapackage which basically means that packages that currently depend on firefox cannot be installed with abrowser
* Actions:
** asac and fta to add abrowser to all firefox rdepends and upload; everyone to help updating extension branches

==== Mozilla Freeze Exceptions ====
* Topic summary: Are there any packages that require freeze exceptions from the Mozilla team?
* Actions:
** Provide FFe for extension updates (those that are uncompatible with Firefox 3, but there are updates available which are compatible with Firefox 3)
** fta and asac try to get 3.1 alpha2 into the archive

==== Team report ====
* Topic summary: How to better track what was done?
* Actions:
** asac to write down how to get items into the monthly reports and send that to mailing list/wiki

==== Status of automatic update for extensions ====
* Topic summary: What we have, what we need, where we are now? 
* Actions:
** write a script "download-xpi-from-amo <extension-name> <version>"
** write a script "request merge <branch1> <branch2>"
** write a high level script that assembles check-extension, download-xpi-from-amo and request-merge to automatically update upstream branches for extension branches that use the med-xpi orig structure

==== Other business ====
* Problem: npviewer.bin keeps crashing on Hardy
* Action: file a bug about removing libflashssupport from ia32-libs

* Problem: outdated extensions
* Action: look over all extensions and see if they a) have been updated in this cycle at all or b) if they can be updated.

* Problem: mozilla-devscripts is not in Debian, so we're still diverging from Debian's extension packages
* Actions:
** file RFP for mozilla-devscripts and get it into debian archive
** asac to find out if initial uploads to debian strictly require a wnpp bug
** blacklist mozilla-devscripts for auto-syncher/MoM
** create debian branch with initial mozilla-devscript debian1 version
