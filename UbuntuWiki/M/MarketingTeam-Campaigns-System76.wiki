System76 does Ubuntu, and consequently Free Software as a whole, a great service by offering only Ubuntu pre-installed on their machines. This shows true commitment and this initiative is to help System76 with the help of the Ubuntu Community, a powerful force that can provide free advertising! Promoting <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuPre-installed|Ubuntu pre-installed]]</nowiki> on new machines is just as, if not more than, important as pushing conversions, yet is not nearly as widespread. That's where we come in =]

== Ideas for System76 ==
# Expand the <nowiki>[[https://system76.authsecure.com/article_info.php?articles_id=26|76er program]]</nowiki> to individuals (not just LoCo's) and not require an account! More materials, even if it's only advertising System76, should be posted on <nowiki>[[http://knowledge76.com/index.php/76er_Program|their wiki]]</nowiki> for anyone to print out and distribute! 
# Over t-shirts and other swag
# Create a referral program for some kind of bonus for those who help System76 make sales. (5% of profit (not income) from a refer-er goes back to them?)
