=== Introduction ===
My name is Mike Bergamo, I am a 21 year old student. I am currently a double major in astronomy and physics at the University of Maryland, College Park. I conduct research in the field of solar type III radio bursts at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. I have been an Ubuntu user for a few years now, but I am just recently beginning to get involved in the Ubuntu Community.

=== Community Involvement ===
I'm just beginning to get involved in the Ubuntu Community, you can find me on #ubuntu-beginners-team IRC most of the time. Updates coming soon.

=== Future Hopes ===
One of the things I would really like to do is join a team and help in maintaining/creating science and engineering applications for those in the field, as well as tools for amateurs and enthusiasts to learn. I would also like to help in the future development and security related issues.

=== Testimonials ===
This is where other people will write testimonials about your work. You don't actually write anything here, let others do the writing.
