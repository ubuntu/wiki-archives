== Main inclusion report for boost ==

=== Requirements ===

1. ''Availability:'' http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/b/boost, compiled on all arches.

2. ''Rationale:'' New build dependency of OpenOffice.org 2; so far the build used the boost version included in the upstream sources. In addition, it's a fairly popular general purpose C++ library.

3. ''Security:''
* No CANs.
* No Secunia record.
* No binaries.

4. ''QA:''
* Installation: only a library, no end user tool.
* Bugs: no Debian/upstream showstopper bugs.
* No special hardware interaction.

5. ''Standards compliance:''
* Standard `debhelper` packaging.
* FHS met.
* Debian policy:
** no SONAME symlinks, but probably the API changes quite often, so that's alright.
** libboost-dev should be Architecture: all
