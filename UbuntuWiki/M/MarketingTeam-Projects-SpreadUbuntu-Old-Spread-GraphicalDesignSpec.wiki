=== Summary ===

SpreadUbuntu is in the process of drafting both content and design. The request for designs is hereby filed to the wide community, and several members have already contributed.
If you wish to create a design too, it is very, very welcome. Please have a look at the designs below, and keep in mind that:
* Basic layout: One block of text, use the text from ubuntu.com for now. If you can think of a pretty way to create in-text links, have at it. Besides that, there should be five big colorful links: See it, Try it, Get it, Shipit and Spread it (this one should stand out from the rest a bit - it's the next level). I think we're looking for a smooth and light look rather than aggressive or sharp. Please go through the previews below for inspiration.
* We want the page to be easy to understand even to people with disabilities or a fair percentage of alcohol in their blood.
* We want it to be visually appealing.
* We want it to be consistent with the other ubuntu sites: no new logo, no new top bar (ie. if you insist on a top bar, try using the one from ubuntu.com.
* If you absolutely don't like the See it, Try it, Get it, Shipit, SPREAD IT idea, feel free to improvise. Keep in mind, that the Spread it should be different from the other four.
* Try not to have too many sets of links in the design. Not good for easy orientation.

=== Design ===

We are collecting designs from the wide public, and in the end we will have a volunteer create a final design based on discussion of the best proposals. If the author of the proposal that is coined the most appropriate were willing, he/she would be the best person for the job.

=== Preview ===

All are available in bzr at http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-marketing/spreadubuntu/spreadubuntu , source files included.

First, we have two from NickMcMahon:
* http://www.tikal26.net/ubuntu/idea1/index.html
* http://www.tikal26.net/ubuntu/idea2/index.html

IJO, SU should be a little more graphical than the above, and I don't think the frames and links are all that necessary. I'd like something very clean and simple. And I love brown gradients ;) -- JendaVancura

Another from JustinHayes:
* http://www.w1ldt4ng3nt.net/csstest/spreadubuntu/

And here's one from Ubuntu-geek:
* http://www.ubuntuforums.org/attachment.php?attachmentid=12575&d=1152665081

And one from <nowiki>[[Kassetra]]</nowiki>:
* <nowiki>[[http://img301.imageshack.us/my.php?image=spreadubuntu1rc.png|Here]]</nowiki>

Two from JoeBrouhard:
* <nowiki>[[http://www.jbrouhard.com/spreadubuntu/spreadubuntu1.jpg|Uno]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[http://www.jbrouhard.com/spreadubuntu/spreadubuntu2.jpg|Dos]]</nowiki>

One series from Alecks:
* <nowiki>[[http://freemediaresources.com/sitedesigns/ubuntumockup.png|Un]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[http://freemediaresources.com/sitedesigns/ubuntumockup2.png|Deux]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[http://freemediaresources.com/sitedesigns/ubuntumockup3.png|Trois]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[http://freemediaresources.com/sitedesigns/ubuntumockup4.png|Quatres]]</nowiki>

Here's a very original one from NestorDiaz:
* <nowiki>[[http://doc.ubuntu.com/~marketing/spreadubuntu/Design%20Mockups/Nestor%20Diaz/spread_ubuntu.png|Hosted by the DocTeam]]</nowiki>

And I made one quick one too, mainly to show what I had in mind:
* <nowiki>[[http://su.mindspin-cms-hosting.de/Mockup.png|One]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[http://www.novarata.net/1/Mockup2.png|Two]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[http://www.novarata.net/1/Mockup3.png|Three]]</nowiki>
You see, there's a reason I asked others to work on it ツ. I did it in inkscape and have the svg. The original image is the work of tristian (art.ubuntu.com). I suppose the bar at the top wouldn't hurt that much, although I was opposed to it before and still hesitant. -- JendaVancura

=== Implementation ===

All the work including sources can now be acquired with:
<code>bzr get http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-marketing/spreadubuntu/spreadubuntu</code>
We have decided that we want to use the idea of Nestor Diaz's suggestion, polish it, and use Kassetra's very fine icons.

==== Update to Implementation work ====

DanBuch (me) is working on a CMS-driven version of the site using Skeletonz http://orangoo.com/skeletonz/ - this will be bzr'd once it resembles something other than the base Skeletonz site :-)

Please let him know if you're a Python coder or if you've got some skills in CSS-based design --> daniel [dot] buch [at] gmail [dot] com

==== Data preservation and migration ====

We have recovered what was available from old designs, but as far as graphics go, most is unusable for our purposes.
