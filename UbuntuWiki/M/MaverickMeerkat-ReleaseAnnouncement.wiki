Some time ago a group of hyper-intelligent pan dimensional beings
decided to finally answer the great question of Life, The Universe and
Everything.  To this end, a small band of these Debians built an
incredibly powerful distribution, Ubuntu. After this great computer
programme had run (a very quick 3 million minutes...or 6 years) the
answer was announced.  The Ultimate answer to Life, the Universe and
Everything is...42, and in its' purest form 101010.  Which suggests that
what you really need to know is 'What was the Question?'.  The great
distribution kindly pointed out that what the problem really was that
no-one knew the question. Accordingly, the distribution designed a set
of successors, marked by a circle of friends...to ultimately bring Unity
to all things living...Ubuntu 10.10, to find the question to the
ultimate answer.

And with that, the Ubuntu team is pleased to announce Ubuntu 10.10. Codenamed
"Maverick Meerkat", 10.10 continues Ubuntu's proud tradition of integrating
the latest and greatest open source technologies into a high-quality,
easy-to-use Linux distribution.

Canonical has also launched the ‘Ubuntu Server on Cloud 10’ program. Anyone
will be able to try out Ubuntu 10.10 Server Edition on Amazon EC2 for free 
for 42 minutes. Visitors to the download pages will now be able to choose to
experience the ease and speed of public cloud computing and Ubuntu.  For a
direct link to the trial, please go to http://10.cloud.ubuntu.com

Ubuntu 10.10 will be supported for 18 months on desktops, netbooks, and servers.  

Thanks to the efforts of the global translation community, Ubuntu is
available in 37 languages.  For a list of supported languages and detailed
translation statistics for these and other languages, see:
