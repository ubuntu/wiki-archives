== Career ==

I have been a system administrator since 1999, working for several organizations with fields ranging from technical to industrial to legal.  My current position is IT Director at a lawfirm specializing in mortgage documents.

== Open Source History ==

I have been an avid user of Ubuntu since Warty and am gradually liberating my computing knowledge from proprietary systems.  Currently, I am learning PHP in my free time.

My focus has been on Ubuntu server installs lately, primarily to enhance intelligence gathering LAMP services.
