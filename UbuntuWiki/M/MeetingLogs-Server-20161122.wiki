 16:03 <cpaelzer> multiple thanks for all the merge work caribou!

 16:03 <jgrimm> indeed!

 16:03 <caribou> that's about all we have

 16:03 <cpaelzer> lets read the SRUs in here if there are any comments on them

 16:03 <caribou> well I'm TIL on a few packages

 16:04 <jgrimm> caribou, btw .. nacc is assigned to look into llvm usage on clamav.  sort out best path forward on eliminating the special version of llvm for clamav

 16:04 <cpaelzer> ok I have another set of SRUs to share as FYI to all of you

 16:04 <cpaelzer> - bug 1633207 waits on upstream before considering SRU

 16:04 <cpaelzer> - bug 1389811 depends on MAAS verifying the just migrated fix for 1559088 (if so DUP+SRU)

 16:04 <caribou> jgrimm: well, debian has removed it

 16:04 <cpaelzer> - bug 1633220 waits for proposed verification

 16:04 <cpaelzer> - bug 1640785 just uploaded, waits for verification soon

 16:04 <cpaelzer> - bug 1626972 working with tinoco from STS (review done, test ongoing and sponsoring afterwards)

 16:04 <jgrimm> caribou, even better. that's what i was going to ask you if still relevant! \o/

 16:05 <caribou> jgrimm: upcoming clamav only has 1 delta from debian

 16:05 <jgrimm> nice!

 16:05 <cpaelzer> \o/

 16:05 <cpaelzer> aynone else ongoing SRUs or having questions for caribou?

 16:05 <caribou> which can be dropped if I MIR tomsfastmath

 16:05 <cpaelzer> the link for x tracking would be

 16:05 <cpaelzer> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-x-tracking-bug-tasks.html#ubuntu-server

 16:05 <jgrimm> caribou, excellent, thank you

 16:06 <cpaelzer> ok - with that lets rewind to the beginning

 16:06 <cpaelzer> #topic Review ACTION points from previous meeting

 16:06 <caribou> cpaelzer: thanks for going in first

 16:06 <cpaelzer> caribou: np, yw

 16:07 <cpaelzer> We had this item - Not Done: (jgrimm) send jamespage email about iscsitarget

 16:07 <cpaelzer> jgrimm: whats up with that one?

 16:07 <jgrimm> Complete.  Note sent at least.

 16:07 <cpaelzer> ok, no other actions from last time

 16:07 <cpaelzer> #topic Zesty Development

 16:07 <jgrimm> no response from james yet, but smb responded that we can discuss at seville f2f

 16:07 <cpaelzer> #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ZestyZapus/ReleaseSchedule

 16:07 <cpaelzer> thanks jgrimm

 16:08 <cpaelzer> anything important/open to discuss on current zesty development?

 16:08 <jgrimm> merges are coming along splendidly!

 16:08 <cpaelzer> I see today and the last few weeks that merges come in much faster than last cycles which should give a change to make them more mature on release

 16:08 <cpaelzer> anything else?

 16:08 * rbasak is deep in cpaelzer's strongswan merge proposal

 16:08 <cpaelzer> thank you rbasak

 16:08 <cpaelzer> I'd have made it simpler if there would have been an option

 16:08 <jgrimm> everyone is doing a great job of grabbing work off of the blueprint

 16:08 <jgrimm> #link https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/servercloud-z-server-core

 16:09 <jgrimm> including [paelzer] Enable AIO backend for tgt: DONE

 16:09 <cpaelzer> rharper: I heard from jgrimm that we might want to do some  perf checks on that to recommend to MAAS - will talk with you at the sprint I think - ok?

 16:10 <cpaelzer> ok everybody seems to be happy with the current pace for now

 16:10 <cpaelzer> lets look at open issues

 16:10 <smoser> cpaelzer, i think maas long term hopes to get rid of tgt

 16:10 <cpaelzer> smoser: good to know

 16:10 <rharper> cpaelzer: yes, maas is the main driver of tgt that I'd like to exercise aio

 16:10 <cpaelzer> smoser: lets include that POV into the discussion on the sprint

 16:10 <jgrimm> +1

 16:10 <rharper> the fallback one is cinder, though not clear how much cinder + iscsi is used in our default openstack deployment

 16:10 <smoser> replacing with http , which removes a spof on iscsi

 16:11 <cpaelzer> interesting

 16:11 <cpaelzer> going to bugs then

 16:11 <cpaelzer> #subtopic Release Bugs

 16:11 <cpaelzer> #link http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-z-tracking-bug-tasks.html#ubuntu-server

 16:12 <cpaelzer> I'm on the qemu one with tinoco

 16:12 <tinoco> o/

 16:12 <jgrimm> and nacc has the django one

 16:12 <cpaelzer> juju likely is the juju team and only wishlist

 16:12 <cpaelzer> ah no that is yet to be classified

 16:13 <cpaelzer> the sssd issue has a STS tag

 16:13 <jgrimm> right

 16:14 <cpaelzer> could anybody ask them to mark assignee and triage it if they intend to take the work on that one?

 16:14 <caribou> cpaelzer: ok, will do

 16:14 <cpaelzer> caribou: ^^

 16:14 <cpaelzer> thanks

 16:15 <cpaelzer> added the tgt/http talk to the sprint planning smoser / rharper

 16:15 <rharper> +1

 16:15 <cpaelzer> ok, I think we are done here

 16:15 <jgrimm> cpaelzer, agreed

 16:15 <cpaelzer> skipping SRUs which we already had brings us to powersj

 16:15 <cpaelzer> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (powersj)

 16:16 <cpaelzer> #link https://jenkins.ubuntu.com/server/

 16:16 <powersj> Lots of work around cloud-init integration test case development. I believe at least a couple of the issues I found are due to the fact that I am running on LXD and not in a cloud/vm. Now have daily tests on trunk setup for curtin, cloud-init, simplestreams.

 16:16 <powersj> For this week, hardening the cloud-init tests this week and making generic for dev release, bit of work on boot time testing, and try to get to my MIR requests. /end

 16:16 <cpaelzer> also we worked on the qemu migration tests and all-but-one are green now https://jenkins.ubuntu.com/server/view/Live%20Migration/

 16:16 <cpaelzer> waiting to see how stable that will be

 16:17 <powersj> oh yes :) that is nice to see

 16:17 <rharper> cpaelzer: nice!

 16:17 <jgrimm> powersj, curious what instability is attributed to running on LXD?

 16:17 <cpaelzer> I think I could share on the sprint what I actually cover to fish for ideas what could be added

 16:18 <cpaelzer> so far almost none of the issues for my tests where due to LXD

 16:18 <powersj> jgrimm: so learned that trying to install snaps in a lxd container doesn't work, nor does zfs

 16:18 <jgrimm> ah, ok.

 16:18 <powersj> I need to close two of the bugs I filed.

 16:18 <jgrimm> yes, we'll have some tests that we'll have to wait for the vm testing

 16:19 <cpaelzer> ok - powersj are you good with the QA status for now?

 16:19 <cpaelzer> so I can go on

 16:19 <powersj> yar

 16:19 <cpaelzer> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb, sforshee)

 16:19 <cpaelzer> didn't see a hand raised yet - is any of you here?

 16:20 <cpaelzer> I pinged smb once more, lets restart that if he shows up later and go on with other sections for now

 16:20 <cpaelzer> ah here he is

 16:20 <smb> sorry forgot the time

 16:20 <cpaelzer> smb: hi - right into you report

 16:20 <cpaelzer> whats up with the kernel this week?

 16:20 <smb> nothing really to report yet anyway

 16:21 <smb> people still fiddle to get a 4.9 for alpha one

 16:22 <cpaelzer> smb: since to the end of a cycle everybody asks what kernel it will be - is there any remotely existing plan what to expect in zesty eventually?

 16:22 <smb> cpaelzer, I don't think we really settled yet

 16:23 <cpaelzer> fine with me - thanks smb

 16:23 <cpaelzer> going on then

 16:23 <cpaelzer> any questions for smb from anybody else?

 16:23 <jgrimm> nope

 16:23 <cpaelzer> #topic Upcoming Call For Papers

 16:23 <cpaelzer> #link https://lwn.net/Calendar/Monthly/cfp/

 16:24 <cpaelzer> #topic Ubuntu Server Team Events

 16:24 <cpaelzer> well we have a Team internal sprint incoming in two weeks

 16:24 <cpaelzer> if anybody wants to suggest something like "you guys shoudl really sit down and discuss about X" please name that X now

 16:25 <cpaelzer> ... I take the silence as a no

 16:25 <cpaelzer> #topic Open Discussion

 16:25 <cpaelzer> anything we forgot to discuss right now?

 16:25 <jgrimm> Nothing from me for once. :)
