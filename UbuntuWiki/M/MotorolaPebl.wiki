Use your Motorola Pebl phone with Ubuntu GNU Linux

=== Bluetooth File Transfer ===

File transfer is supported via gnome-bluetooth (apt package name) 

=== Evolution Contact Transfer ===

Problem: Evolution exports Version 3.0 vcard, Pebl phone imports Version 2.1

Solution: just change the version numbers in the files

=== Sync in Dual Boot Configuration Ubuntu & Win XP ===

I wanted to transfer my Evolution Calendar to my Pebl. I use this awkward, but feasible steps. (Please add a better solution, if you know one)

==== Ubuntu Linux Steps ====
1. Export Evolution .vcs vcalendar file (vcalendar version 2.0) 

2. Import to KDE Kalendar and export Kalendar .vcs vcalendar (vcalendar version 1.0)
==== Win XP Steps ====
3. Import KDE Kalendar .vcs file to Outlook 

4. Sync Pebl via Motorola Software
