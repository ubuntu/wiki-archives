=== Ubuntu Open Week - Running a FOSS Event - czajkowski - Mon, Nov 2, 2009 ===

<pre>
[21:59] <czajkowski> Aloha, I'm Laura Czajkowski, I help to run the Ubuntu-ie (Ireland) LoCo. I started to run events 5 years ago at college for my computer society and have picked up some useful pieces of information which I've found helpful.
[21:59] <czajkowski> So firstly different types of events need varied amounts of preparation and organising, I'm going to try and cover and give you a few examples. Check lists, how to advertise them and just some general advice from my past events.
[22:00] <czajkowski> I'll go through some stuff and then take some questions.
[22:00] <czajkowski> It can be hard to come up with new events
[22:00] <czajkowski> and know what to run
[22:00] <czajkowski> Types of events:
[22:00] <czajkowski> Geeknics - Picnic for Geeks, take yourselves out of the server room and from behind the desk. This is great as it means your family and kids can come along and get more of a community spirit behind it. Pick a park get people to bring along food they can share, some parks you can have a BBQ, something different.
[22:00] <czajkowski> We have a standard monthly meet up in the pub, it can be anywhere, called a Pint of the Day. Just meet up, bring along a laptop and show something off you've seen or demo a new feature, great time now that karmic is out. On our mailing list anyone can post posting a date and time and a venue to go for a random PotD which is great for visiting LoCos so they can meet up with us.
[22:00] <czajkowski> Pub Quiz - to add a bit of fun to just going to the pub and make it a bit more geeky, you can have a lot of fun with this and come up with some crazy questions to out geek the person beside you.
[22:00] <czajkowski> you can hav e great fun with the questions
[22:01] <czajkowski> making them very geeky or just have some fun
[22:01] <czajkowski> Mark Shuttleworth is also known as 'sabdfl', what does this abbreviation stand for?
[22:01] <czajkowski> What does 'Ubuntu LoCo' stand for?
[22:01] <czajkowski> Ubuntu Community's manager name is: _______ _______
[22:01] <czajkowski> Demo/Small Talk - try and get a small room put aside, depending on size, libraries are great to offer a small reading room, and you could have lightning talks where members of the community pick a topic and just get up and give a 5 minuet talk Â on it without the need for projectors
[22:01] <czajkowski> Larger Events
[22:01] <czajkowski> Barcamps -Would like to offer to help LoCos organise their own, I run www.ossbarcamp.com and would like to offer this domain to LoCos to run their own and get lots of these happening throughout the year. Shall come back to this.
[22:01] <czajkowski> Conferences - need to be sure you can get an audience to attend.
[22:02] <czajkowski> Advertising the Event:
[22:02] <czajkowski> So I've found the best way to get your event noticed, no matter how small or large it is, is to get the word out everywhere as many times as you can and in as many places. There are so many avenues for this so lots of choice and it might be an idea to give members of your community tasks to spread the work and also get them familiar with how to promote events.
[22:02] <czajkowski> identi.ca and twitter are great tools, if you have an # tag advertise this in advance so people know what to tag an event with or follow if they can't be there.
[22:02] <czajkowski> Mailing list and IRC are 2 of the avenues I heavily use to let people know about our events as I've found them very useful. If there are similar groups in your area or members belong to other groups get them to drop an email about your event.
[22:02] <czajkowski> Blogs - if you don't have access to getting your blog post up on the planet.Ubuntu ask someone would they post an article you've written. I'm sure others would like to hear about it and attend if they were holidaying or may even visit just for this event.
[22:03] <czajkowski> Podcasts - they're popping up everywhere and there are a lot of them out there that look for content so why not talk to them and get some coverage for your event.
[22:03] <czajkowski> Fossevents.org is another site I help to maintain and it has all oss/foss events on it so do add yours there. We've made it easier to submit events, and we're still working on maps, and ical feeds for LoCos
[22:03] <czajkowski> Media coverage - local and national papers, write to them and let them know what you are doing and why they should come and see what you guys are doing they may be interested, curious and only looking for an invitation to come along.
[22:03] <czajkowski> you get to meet media, if you go to events, not just oss ones, web conferences are a great way to meet more people and make the connections, they'll also help spread the word on your event
[22:04] <czajkowski> again this is just stuff I've come up with in the past
[22:04] <czajkowski> the list is no where complete but it may help new locos or old ones get some ideas
[22:04] <czajkowski>  
[22:05] <czajkowski> How to find a venue:
[22:05] <czajkowski>  
[22:05] <czajkowski> Will depend on your event and also size of audience. If you're near a college, they are the best avenue for help, small classrooms and large rooms if needed. Plus the added larger bonus of usually having a good internet connection which is ideal for running global jam sessions. They also usually won't charge as they want their students to learn more. Offer to give a demo on bug triaging to the students to get the colle
[22:05] <czajkowski>  
[22:05] <czajkowski> Hotels may have function rooms these could be used for larger more formal days of talks, try and get these sponsored, point out X number of people in there for the day, and they will most likely eat and drink in there
[22:05] <czajkowski>  
[22:05] <czajkowski> don't be afraid to ask them to sponsor some food or drinks
[22:05] <czajkowski> most will give you something, or at least a discount or deal
[22:06] <czajkowski> I've written all of these down and will post afterwards if it helps.
[22:06] <czajkowski> QUESTION: Who is a good point of contact when sending a note to the media to try and get coverage, what has worked for you?
[22:07] <czajkowski> well I first try looking up the journalists in IT in maybe the newspapers or online jounrnals and getting a name
[22:07] <czajkowski> if you have a name it's easier to follow up on and get feedback
[22:07] <czajkowski> maybe they don't know about oss or you didn't give enough information in the opening letter to get their interest
[22:08] <czajkowski>  
[22:08] <czajkowski> What do to once it's been organised:
[22:08] <czajkowski>  
[22:08] <czajkowski> this is more of a check list
[22:09] <czajkowski> if you['ve never ran a large event , don't worry, mistakes will happen, but as long as people have  agood day out, it'll be worth it
[22:09] <czajkowski> Once you have the date and venue organised keep the reminders going, topic in irc channel, your loco website, create a wiki page for you events so you can keep track of them, and afterwards write up a list of things you would change or notes you've made from running the event.
[22:09] <czajkowski> Remember all events can be improved on, there is no 1st event going to ever run 100% smoothly. Don't panic if something goes wrong. Have a back up plan, a back up speaker or someone you can rely on to get up and demo or talk about a topic if you need to fill a slot or while you wait on a speaker to arrive.
[22:09] <czajkowski>  
[22:09] <czajkowski> When running a larger event ( anything that involves more than going to the pub) things you need to do:
[22:09] <czajkowski> like tonight I made a list
[22:09] <czajkowski> it's what keeps me from going insane
[22:09] <czajkowski> :)
[22:09] <czajkowski> I'm a bit of a list fanatic, it's what works for me. Items get written down and crossed off literally! A new list is made and I work through what needs to be done. I like organising, that's me. I'm a tad bit obsessive about some things, I'll have my list done up, and saved somewhere online that I can check against to make sure things are being done, when they are done, they are moved elsewhere in the list to Completed 
[22:10] <czajkowski> find something that works for you.
[22:10] <czajkowski> o some simple check lists, they may seem very simple and common sense, but eh don't take simple things and common sense for granted when organising events!
[22:10] <czajkowski> don't take on the whole event on your own
[22:10] <czajkowski> we're a community
[22:10] <czajkowski> lets put us to work and there will be members in your loco who excel at posters or writing articles
[22:11] <czajkowski> uwe these people
[22:11] <czajkowski> *use
[22:11] <czajkowski>  Meet regularly! Email is not enough.
[22:11] <czajkowski> Face to face meet ups are the only way, as you bounce ideas off one and another and come up with better ideas/solutions to problems.
[22:11] <czajkowski> because in the past I've had the experience of this
[22:11] <czajkowski> A useful tool I've learnt to do is if you do email people concerning the event, CC someone else on the committee so that if you get a date/time/venue or some detail off, there is hope that someone else will spot it and can be rectified, otherwise you could be organising something for September when the event locations organiser thinks it's in Augus
[22:12] <czajkowski> which you can imagine leads to lots of heart failures :)
[22:12] <czajkowski>  
[22:12] <czajkowski> Advertise the event in as many locations as you can. Again depending on the event, but I would say hit colleges first, as many lectures, students may be interested, bonus if your conference is also located on the grounds, you can get college/staff mailing lists.
[22:12] <czajkowski>  
[22:12] <czajkowski> Final run up to the event, go through your check list, which should consist of a large Done/Completed list and there really should be no â€œTo Do's â€ left anywhere on it :)
[22:12] <czajkowski> Have this done a week before hand to allow for things just cropping up!
[22:13] <czajkowski> these would be for events other than pub/geeknics
[22:13] <czajkowski>  
[22:13] <czajkowski> Have the presenting laptop all set up with a separate login with all of the presentations on it.
[22:13] <czajkowski>  
[22:13] <czajkowski> Sticky point, dealing with speakers can sometimes be a lot of hassle, get all speakers to use the one laptop, it's set up and works with the projector. Unplugging and plugging in another one causes unnecessary time wasting for all those involved
[22:13] <czajkowski>  
[22:13] <czajkowski> Get all presentations a week in advance, I asked for them 2 days in advance and got all bar 2, one of which as the guy was travelling and I knew this. The other I got on the day of the event. In future I'd ask for them a week in advance, and if you don't get it, pull the person. Simple as, if one person can do it, so can everyone.
[22:13] <czajkowski>  
[22:14] <czajkowski> nothing worse than being in a talk and wanting to leave to go to the next one as it's run over
[22:14] <czajkowski> Have a person sitting in the audience who will hold up a car with 10 minutes, 5 minutes and 1 minutes to go. It is necessary to keep time under control, and again some speakers will get the knickers in a twist at being told to shut up and get off the stage as the next speaker is due on.
[22:14] <czajkowski> I've missed a few talks this way!
[22:14] <czajkowski> If you are renting a venue give it back to the organisation the way you got it. It sounds simple, but you'd be amazed the way people leave their rubbish behind. Make sure everyone leaves with you, locks up and goes with you. If you leave folks behind you have no way of making sure the place is locked up and left in the correct order.
[22:14] <czajkowski>  
[22:14] <czajkowski> Sit back and enjoy the event. As I said, this is not a complete list, it's some thoughts and what's worked in the past for me, or I've learnt from the past events
[22:14] <czajkowski> If anyone wants any help pm me or drop me an email czajkowski@ubuntu.com I'll try and help and give you some feedback.
[22:14] <czajkowski> If LoCos are interested I'd love to see www.LoCo.ossbarcamp.com happen.
[22:15] <czajkowski> Sorry I know I covered a lot
[22:15] <czajkowski> but ready if anyone has any questions
[22:16] <czajkowski> I have found by going to other groups events they'll promote mine. so going to a php event , they'll send a mail to their list about our event
[22:16] <czajkowski> < akgraner> QUESTION:  What are the best tips and who/what corporate groups do you tend to seek funding from 1st
[22:16] <czajkowski> yeah this can be the tricky one
[22:17] <czajkowski> I've found that again getting a name, rather than info@company name to be wise
[22:17] <czajkowski> the HR department I've rang on ocassions and asked them who would be best to contact and I usally get marketing and they will usually be very helpful
[22:17] <czajkowski> rashsystems> did www.LoCo.ossbarcamp.com not work for anyone else?
[22:18] <czajkowski> so I'd like to offer to help LoCos run their own ossbarcamp
[22:18] <czajkowski> the site is there
[22:18] <czajkowski> and would be great to see say northcarolina.ossbarcamp.com or rome.ossbarcamp.com take place
[22:19] <czajkowski> I find if you name an event about a product/os it may not help when trying to get sponsorship
[22:19] <czajkowski> the idea of getting presenters presentations before hand is to save time between switching pc's and set uo
[22:19] <czajkowski> *up
[22:19] <czajkowski> try and have them all on one desktop
[22:19] <czajkowski> in a folder so they can just launch them
[22:20] <czajkowski> 22:18 < aim1159> QUESTION: in russia we faced with the problem - people does not want to meet "unknown strangers" even if they do the same thing - wowing about ubuntu. How to deal  with such a problem?
[22:20] <czajkowski> so how do you get people to come along
[22:20] <czajkowski> we held out release party last week and a few showed up who'd never been active on irc or mailing lists
[22:21] <czajkowski> they came because we did 2 events 1- dinner and 2 pub
[22:21] <czajkowski> it's to try and find an event your loco will enjoy, not everyone wants to go to a pub
[22:21] <czajkowski> so a pub quiz might be a way of getting people involved and also chatting to one another
[22:21] <czajkowski> tonyyarusso> QUESTION:  Our latest event had a much worse male:female ratio than our group as a whole does.  Any idea why this may be and how to rectify it in the future?
[22:22] <czajkowski> well that's going to depend on how many are active in your loco
[22:22] <czajkowski> the event could be a deciding factor
[22:22] <czajkowski> try to mix and match events
[22:22] <czajkowski> don't stick to the same one
[22:22] <czajkowski> try adn cater for your're loco
[22:23] <czajkowski> I've started to use doodle.com
[22:23] <czajkowski> create a poll
[22:23] <czajkowski> put up sugestions on events
[22:23] <czajkowski> 1 geeknic
[22:23] <czajkowski> 2 quiz
[22:23] <czajkowski> 3 talk
[22:23] <czajkowski> let your loco decide
[22:23] <czajkowski> get them participating
[22:23] <czajkowski> it also means more involvement
[22:24] <czajkowski>  
[22:25] <czajkowski> re sponsorship make sure you thank them after the event
[22:25] <czajkowski> send them photos
[22:25] <czajkowski> and a thank you card
[22:25] <czajkowski> they'll remember that the next time or even be willing to approach you to sponsor you again
[22:26] <czajkowski> 22:25 < akgraner> QUESTION:  Do you find if people have owner in planning the event then they are more likely to promote and encourage attendance?  So would handing out specific  tasks be useful?
[22:26] <czajkowski> for me I like to orgnaise
[22:26] <czajkowski> but I know the loco needs more than my skill set
[22:26] <czajkowski> I cannot do everything
[22:26] <czajkowski> there are others in the loco who can do other work and we need them
[22:27] <czajkowski> so you really should be encouraging your members to step up and help
[22:27] <czajkowski>  
[22:27] <czajkowski> they may find it daunting, so I'd suggest pairing them up.  buddy system
[22:28] <czajkowski> there is no such thing as a bad orgnaiser!!!
[22:28] <czajkowski> you need attendees
[22:28] <czajkowski> and with that they need to participate
[22:28] <czajkowski> so try a few types
[22:29] <czajkowski> simple non geeky event ye can do as a goup, go bowing/catch a game
[22:29] <czajkowski> cinema - find a nerdy movie and go :) in costume
[22:29] <czajkowski> loads of choices
[22:29] <czajkowski> events dont have to be release partys the whole time :)
[22:30] <czajkowski>  
[22:31] <czajkowski> after an event ,ask you loco membembers what they'd change, date/venue/time
[22:31] <czajkowski>   
[22:32] <czajkowski> meant to say, when you're advertising your event, if you don't have your blog on the planet, ask someone to post your article for you, before and after the event, let others know what you['re doing, it give people ideas on what they can do too
[22:33] <czajkowski>  
[22:33] <czajkowski> many people have families and weekend times are hard to give up
[22:33] <czajkowski> try holding events where families can come along
[22:34] <czajkowski> our geeknics were a great success here, wives came along with the kids and met others
[22:34] <czajkowski>  
[22:34] <czajkowski> any other questions?
[22:35] <czajkowski>  
[22:35] <czajkowski> Are any locos planning any specific events, they'd like to ask for advice on?
[22:35] <czajkowski>   
[22:35] <czajkowski> < saffronlee> QUESTION: how do you make meetings more firendly for women?
[22:37] <czajkowski> Well I'm a female and never really had an issue with events being friendly. But, perhaps not every male or female wants to go to a pub the whole time, so vary your event. Ask the members in your loco what they would like to do
[22:38] <czajkowski>  
[22:38] <czajkowski>  Michelle_Qimo> QUESTION:  Anything you've done that you would advise *against*?
[22:38] <czajkowski> in 5 years doing this....
[22:38] <czajkowski> a lot!
[22:39] <czajkowski> don't go out the night before if I'm getting up at 8am to run  a conferenfce!!
[22:39] <czajkowski>  
[22:39] <czajkowski> double check the venue with the venue owners, don't rely on someone else saying it's done
[22:39] <czajkowski> we lost a large venue and 3 speakers one year
[22:40] <czajkowski>  
[22:40] <czajkowski> Have boot up cds on standby in case the machines you're using fails
[22:40] <czajkowski>  
[22:41] <czajkowski>  < Michelle_Qimo> we're working on a spouses group down here - so all the wives/partners/etc. feel safe
[22:41] <czajkowski> that's a great idea
[22:42] <czajkowski> and it worked well when the wives/partnes came to geeknic they met fellow non techy people and enjoyed a nice afternoon - remember to inculde the extended loco
[22:42] <czajkowski>   
[22:42] <czajkowski> 2:41 < tonyyarusso> SUGGESTION:  If running an installfest, have a local mirror of the package repositories - much less waiting for downloads, more doing!  (Learned from the  difference between our Jaunty and Karmic events)
[22:42] <czajkowski> great idea
[22:43] <czajkowski> also if runing an event, make sure there are no planned outtages :~(
[22:43] <czajkowski> ideally I like to run my events in a college
[22:43] <czajkowski> great size rooms
[22:43] <czajkowski> students to take part and become part of the loco
[22:43] <czajkowski> great internet bandwidth
[22:44] <czajkowski>  
[22:44] <czajkowski> as I'd never done this before I didnt know what to expect  so I wrote it all up as I was afraid I'd not be able to explain it http://cypher.skynet.ie/Openweek/
[22:45] <czajkowski>  
[22:45] <czajkowski> I'll send a mail out later on with it also for loco members and also again offer if locos want to run an ossbarcamp
[22:46] <czajkowski>  
[22:47] <czajkowski> remember do  enjoy any event no matter how small or big,
[22:47] <czajkowski> < tonyyarusso> QUESTION:  What forms of advertisement seem to have the best ROI?
[22:47] <czajkowski> IRC
[22:47] <czajkowski> Mailing lists
[22:47] <czajkowski> blogs - my blog is on a few plannets
[22:47] <czajkowski> and then I also poke the national papers
[22:47] <czajkowski> and the online e-magazines
[22:47] <czajkowski> somethimes they will cover events
[22:47] <czajkowski> other times no
[22:48] <czajkowski> but if I let them know about it, there is a higher chance
[22:48] <czajkowski> I also mail all of the 3rd level colleges and let their IT departments know about an event and if they have a computer society
[22:48] <czajkowski>  
[22:48] <czajkowski> thats how I got involved in this.
[22:49] <czajkowski> also
[22:49] <czajkowski> fossevents.org
[22:49] <czajkowski> has a lot of oss events on it
[22:49] <czajkowski> postering hasn't worked as well as I thought it would have worked
[22:49] <czajkowski> perhaps there are too many out there over here
[22:49] <czajkowski> but again
[22:50] <czajkowski> try it for your area
[22:50] <czajkowski> podcasts are also good, local and international ones (ubuntu-uk podcast)
[22:51] <czajkowski> think that's it folks
[22:51] <czajkowski> thanks for coming :)
