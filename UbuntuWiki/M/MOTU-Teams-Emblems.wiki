__TOC__

This page is for contributions of icons, emblems, and other graphical material, for the UC/MOTU to consider.

=== Emblems contributed by mok0 ===
I have produced a couple of suggestions for icons for the the Ubuntu  
Contributor Team on Launchpad.

In recognition of the important "nuts-and-bolts" work of the  
contributor team, one icon is a wrench (<nowiki>[[File:wrench_emblem.png]]</nowiki>), the other is a cogwheel in  
Ubuntu-orange (<nowiki>[[File:cogwheel_emblem.png]]</nowiki>). Perhaps one of them could be used.
