__TOC__

I live in Nashua, NH, USA, and I've been running Linux since '98.
I started with Red Hat and I've toured through Fedora, Mandrake, and Gentoo (long stop there) - and the tour ends at Ubuntu.

=== Interests ===

** FOSS Awareness - I work with Software Freedom International, which organized the first international Software Freedom Day celebration in 2004.  Please check out <nowiki>[[http://softwarefreedomday.org|our website]]</nowiki> to find out how you can help celebrate FOSS on the third Saturday of September every year!

** Linux --> Education - I want to see Linux replace MS as the platform that dominates education. Edubuntu has driven LTSP development forward and we now have a solid, aesthetically-pleasing, thin client solution with long-sought features such as pluggable devices that "just work".

I'm "moquist" in the forums and in #ubuntu, and I'd love to hear from you at moquist-ubuntu -at- majen.net if you care to drop me a line.
