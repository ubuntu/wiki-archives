=== General ===

Packaging new software is a valuable task, but sometimes not trivial. Consider the following when you attempt to package new software:

* You'll be the maintainer. You'll be responsible for the new software. You'll liaise with the upstream developers and take care of all the bugs.
* The best maintainer for a package is somebody who has a special interest in the software.
* You'll make a lot of users happy.

=== Resources ===

* Review the list of <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bugs?field.tag=needs-packaging|Packages requested by others]]</nowiki> and in concordance with the points above, assign the bug to yourself.
* <nowiki>[[UbuntuDevelopment/NewPackages|Policy for inclusion of new packages]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[PackagingGuide/Basic|How to package from scratch]]</nowiki>.
