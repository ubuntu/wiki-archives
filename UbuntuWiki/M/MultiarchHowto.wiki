__TOC__

Use of multiarch is not currently enabled by default on any architecture because of, among other things, an impact on the performance of 'apt-get update'.  Users can manually enable multiarch in oneiric by doing the following:

* Create a file <code>/etc/dpkg/dpkg.cfg.d/multiarch</code> containing a line <code>foreign-architecture $arch</code> for the ''$arch'' of interest
* If different mirrors are needed for the main arch vs. the foreign arch (e.g., archive.ubuntu.com vs. ports.ubuntu.com), add lines to <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> like this:
<pre>
deb [arch=armel] http://ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-ports/ oneiric main
</pre>
* run apt-get update
* install packages, specifying the architecture as <code>:$arch</code> after the package name:
<pre>
sudo apt-get install libxext-dev:armel
</pre>
