I'm an Ubuntu user and advocate, but I wasn't always. It took me a little while to find this gem. I started with RedHat, dabbled with Fedora before switching to Debian. I still run Debian on most of my production servers at work, but will be keeping an eye on LTS releases as a replacement. My primary laptop has been running Ubuntu for nearly a year now and I love it.

I have joined the ColoradoTeam and hope to learn, teach, spread the word about Ubuntu.
