== Main Inclusion Report for gluezilla ==

=== Requirements ===

# ''Availability:'' <nowiki>[[http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/g/gluezilla/]]</nowiki>; available for all Mono-supported architectures.
# ''Rationale:''
** libgluezilla is dependency of the libmono-webbrowser0.5-cil 2.0+ Debian binary package, and is frequently used as the preferred browser engine for applications.
** Including gluezilla allows a greater number of apps (such as mono) to be synced rather than merged.
0. ''Security:''
** no entries in mitre
** no entries in secunia
** Network activity: This is a helper library for a language binding for a web browser engine. Network activity will only be initiated by applications using the binding.
0. ''Quality assurance:''
** The package works out of the box
** no debconf questions asked
