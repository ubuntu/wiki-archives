== Main inclusion report for ps2eps ==

=== Requirements ===

1. ''Availability:'' http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/p/ps2eps, compiled on all arches.

2. ''Rationale:'' New build dependency of `gsl` which is already in main. In addition, an uncritical and handy tool on its own.

3. ''Security:''
* No CANs.
* No Secunia record.
* No security relevant binaries.
* It is very unlikely that this program will be used by privileged processes.

4. ''QA:''
* Installation: Two simple command line programs, works out of the box.
* Works smoothly for a few test PostScript files.
* Bugs: no showstopper Debian bugs; no upstream bug tracker.
* No special hardware interaction.

5. ''Standards compliance:''
* Standard `debhelper`/`dpatch` packaging.
* FHS met.
* Debian package and library policy met.
