__TOC__



Accessibility has always been high on the Agenda for the Ubuntu community and at the present moment Mozilla Based software often falls down a little in its performance against the rest of the desktop software, however we want to change this, but we need your help!

=== What is currently being done? ===

Currently we are liaising with the Accessibility Team, flagging potential bugs with the "Accessibility" tag, this enables us to stop potential issues easily. We are also involved in testing the various improvements to Firefox and Thunderbird that the Accessibility Team is doing. This is mainly in Orca and with the web being such a vibrant place bugs seem to pop up on some websites.

=== What can I do? ===

You can help the Accessibility Team by testing Mozilla software in Ubuntu with the latest version of Orca and reporting bugs, you can also join in discussion on their <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-accessibility|mailing list]]</nowiki>.
