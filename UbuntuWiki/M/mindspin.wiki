__TOC__

== Markus Wimmer aka mindspin ==

I'm 43 Years old and live nearby Frankfurt (Germany, not Kentucky:-).

I'm a Linux user and admin since about 1999, offering the hosting of content management systems. The main part of my living is made by writing and working for a public-relations agency and some local newspapers. I'm using kubuntu since hoary and I am a proud user of kubuntu 6.06 LTS.

My aim is to support ubuntu in all it's flavours by writing about it, spreading the word, and throw in my experience in both, the technical and publishing area. Attending at Fairs and conferences and representing (K)ubuntu is another important and pleasuring part of my activities in the ubuntu world.

I am member of the marketing team, the press-relations team and the german kubuntu team.
