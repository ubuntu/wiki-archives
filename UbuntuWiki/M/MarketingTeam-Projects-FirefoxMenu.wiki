This page should be used to plan out the Firefox Marketing Menu extension. 

=== What we have now ===

So far we have the basic idea taken from the <nowiki>[[http://wiki.ubuntu-it.org/InternetRete/Navigazione/Firefox/MenuUbuntuIt|Italian LoCo menu]]</nowiki> but needs to be adapted to suit our needs. 

Here is a diagram of how the menu could be structured. Feel free to add anything to it, and update the image.
