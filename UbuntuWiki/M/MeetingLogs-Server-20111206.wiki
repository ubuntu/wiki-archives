[16:31] <smb> otherwise smoser, what do you have for me today :)
[16:32] <smoser> he likes to do silly things, like attach the same disk to 2 different buses.
[16:32] <smoser> so, smb please take a read at that.
[16:32] <smb> Which is the thing xen does sort of
[16:32] <smoser> sort of... although he points out that it might be more difficult.
[16:33] <smoser> as in xen, you can compleletely ignore the emulated if you have the xen_pv
[16:33] <smb> yeah, agreed
[16:33] <smoser> but in kvm, you can't copletely ignore the scsi bus if you have virtio devices.
[16:33] <smoser> so, its fun.
[16:33] <smb> I guess he wants to do something like that under kvm
[16:33] <smoser> right.
[16:33] <smb> Not that I think it is supported
[16:33] <smoser> s/wants to/does do/
[16:33] <smoser> and wants you to support it
