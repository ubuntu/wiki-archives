=== App Developer Week -- Introducing Bazaar Explorer: Version Control for your Apps - Riddell -- Mon, Sep 5th, 2011 ===
<pre>
[17:01] <dpm> Next up is Jonathan Riddell, the Kubuntu rockstar who's on his way of becoming a bzr rockstar this cycle too
[17:01] <Riddell> good day everyone
[17:02] <Riddell> I'm going to give an introduction to Bazaar Explorer
[17:02] <Riddell> and convince you it's a developer tool everyone should use
[17:02] <Riddell> you can follow along by following the images at http://ec2-184-72-177-203.compute-1.amazonaws.com/owncloud/
[17:02] <Riddell> access with guest/guest
[17:03] <Riddell> Bazaar is the world's finest revision control system
[17:03] <Riddell> if you're coding on files, or even have any non coding files you should use it to keep track of them
[17:03] <Riddell> it's fully distributed so you can use it to collaborate with others very easily
[17:04] <Riddell> you don't need a fancy server to use it, it works locally fine
[17:04] <Riddell> but it's also easy to put on a server, http or ssh is all you need
[17:04] <Riddell> if you don't want it distributed you don't have to
[17:04] <Riddell> and it's designed to be easy to use for people familiar with CVS or Subversion
[17:05] <Riddell> it gives the full power of tools like git but it's understandable to people other than Linus
[17:05] <Riddell> it's used everywhere in ubuntu
[17:05] <Riddell> to store all our packaging and code
[17:05] <Riddell> and it's used in large projects like mysql
[17:06] <Riddell> most people will be familiar with Bazaar through bzr, the command line interface
[17:06] <Riddell> command line interfaces are great for those of use who are comfortable with command lines
[17:07] <Riddell> but as Ubuntu spreads out amongst non-geeks we need it to be available to everyone
[17:07] <Riddell> and besides sometimes GUIs are just better even for hardcore geeks
[17:07] <Riddell> so Bazaar Explorer is the GUI for Bazaar
[17:07] <Riddell> well I should say it's /a/ GUI for Bazaar
[17:07] <Riddell> but it is by far the most complete
[17:08] <Riddell> bulldog98 asked: what toolkit is it written in?
[17:08] <Riddell> it's written in Qt with Python
[17:08] <Riddell> an excellent choice for writing any GUI application
[17:09] <Riddell> Qt means its cross platform so it runs anywhere
[17:09] <Riddell> Python means its easy to fix and improve
[17:09] <Riddell> you can install it from any package manager
[17:09] <Riddell> sudo apt-get install bzr-explorer   will do it
[17:10] <Riddell> and run it from the application menu where it's listed as Bazaar Explorer
[17:10] <Riddell> or from a command line as:  bzr explorer
[17:11] <Riddell> when you start it, it'll look like the image 01 on that owncloud server or http://www.flickr.com/photos/jriddell/6116796188/in/photostream
[17:11] <Riddell> actually if you've never used Bazaar before it'll probably prompt you for your name and e-mail first
[17:13] <ClassBot> bulldog98 asked: what toolkit is it written in?
[17:13] <ClassBot> bulldog98 asked: why does the oneiric package depends on tango? Canâ€™t oxygen be used?
[17:13] <Riddell> hmm, this bot is fiddly
[17:13] <Riddell> it uses Tango icons, there's not currently an option to use Oxygen icons I'm afraid
[17:13] <Riddell> fixes welcome :)
[17:14] <Riddell> let's use bzr explorer to get some code
[17:14] <Riddell> http://www.flickr.com/photos/jriddell/6116252311/in/photostream  shows us going to the "Get project sources from elsewhere" tab
[17:15] <Riddell> I want to branch a project to make a change to it
[17:15] <Riddell> so I click on the Branch button and enter into the address box  lp:ubuntu-cdimage
[17:15] <Riddell> http://www.flickr.com/photos/jriddell/6116802008/in/photostream
[17:15] <Riddell> you can host Bazaar branches anywhere but one of the most common places to do so is in Launchpad
[17:16] <Riddell> which hosts any free software project for free, how very generous
[17:16] <Riddell> Launchpad branches have a nice shortcut to their location which is  lp:
[17:16] <Riddell> and in this case I'm wanting the trunk from the ubuntu-cdimage project
[17:16] <Riddell> so I tell it to branch that code
[17:17] <Riddell> http://www.flickr.com/photos/jriddell/6116257777/in/photostream
[17:17] <Riddell> ah but wait, what's this, which I like to initialise a shared repository?
[17:17] <Riddell> bzr is so good at making branches that it's common to make a new branch for any notable change
[17:18] <Riddell> then you can edit the branch with out worrying about mistakes
[17:18] <Riddell> and merge it into the main branch when you're happy
[17:18] <Riddell> this leaves a load of branch directories around on your hard disk
[17:18] <Riddell> which might be wasteful of disk space
[17:19] <Riddell> so a shared repository will share all the history which is the same in your branches
[17:19] <Riddell> so yes we do want to make the shared repository
[17:19] <Riddell> a new dialogue box pops up http://www.flickr.com/photos/jriddell/6116801334/in/photostream/
[17:20] <Riddell> we let it do its initialisation then we get the branch we want http://www.flickr.com/photos/jriddell/6116800620/in/photostream/
[17:20] <Riddell> an voila, bzr explorer is ready to work on this branch http://www.flickr.com/photos/jriddell/6116800344/in/photostream/
[17:20] <Riddell> <bulldog98> I canâ€™t see a pic in the owncloud server
[17:21] <Riddell> well just use the flickr images, they're the same
[17:21] <Riddell> if you look in a file manager it will have made a ubuntu-cdimage/ directory and within it a trunk/ directory
[17:22] <Riddell> the ubuntu-cdimage/ directory is our shared repository and the trunk/ directory is our branch we just made
[17:23] <Riddell> in the bottom right of Bazaar Explorer is the working tree, you can open files from there to edit them if you wish
[17:23] <Riddell> or open the whole directory in a file manager or an IDE
[17:23] <Riddell> today I'm going to add a new Ubuntu flavour
[17:23] <Riddell> Bazaarbuntu!
[17:23] <Riddell> it's going to be the distro to take over the world
[17:24] <Riddell> so I'll edit the file in ubuntu-cdimage to start making those CD images http://www.flickr.com/photos/jriddell/6116800100/in/photostream/
[17:25] <Riddell> having made the edit the Bazaar Explorer page will refresh to note that I have changes
[17:25] <Riddell> (if it doesn't automatically refresh then you have a version without my automatic refresh patch, you can click the "refresh" button)
[17:25] <Riddell> if I want to see my changes I can click on Diff  http://www.flickr.com/photos/jriddell/6116255747/in/photostream/
[17:26] <Riddell> and if I want to save the change to the Bazaar repository I can click on commit  http://www.flickr.com/photos/jriddell/6116804398/in/photostream
[17:27] <Riddell> this will save the change to my local branch
[17:27] <Riddell> but now I want to publish the change to the wider world so I need to push it to another location which is publically available
[17:27] <Riddell> http://www.flickr.com/photos/jriddell/6116803820/in/photostream/
[17:27] <Riddell> there I'm pushing it to a branch on Launchpad
[17:29] <Riddell> so now anyone can see my branch on the web https://code.launchpad.net/~jr/+junk/bazaarbuntu
[17:29] <Riddell> and anyone can download it or review the change
[17:29] <Riddell> Bazaar Explorer can access most of the functions of bzr, such as looking at the log of commits
[17:29] <Riddell> http://www.flickr.com/photos/jriddell/6116803174/in/photostream/
[17:30] <Riddell> http://www.flickr.com/photos/jriddell/6116258943/in/photostream/
[17:30] <Riddell> infact it can access all the functions of bzr because if there's a bzr command without a gui you can use the "All" option to run it
[17:31] <Riddell> if I want to make more complex changes I probably want to make a new local branch http://www.flickr.com/photos/jriddell/6116802386/in/photostream/
[17:32] <Riddell> and work on that, then merge it in to trunk when I'm happy
[17:33] <Riddell> of course you don't always care about having branches
[17:34] <Riddell> you might prefer to work more like subversion or cvs where you just checkout directly from the server
[17:34] <Riddell> and commit directly back
[17:34] <Riddell> Bazaar and Bazaar Explorer support this
[17:34] <Riddell> back on the welcome page i click Checkout http://www.flickr.com/photos/jriddell/6116798884
[17:35] <Riddell> here I checkout the ubuntu seeds
[17:35] <Riddell> I make my change (adding bzr-explorer)
[17:35] <Riddell> and commit directly back http://www.flickr.com/photos/jriddell/6116798624/
[17:35] <Riddell> that's working with existing projects
[17:36] <Riddell> but we are App Developers and we want to make our own projects!
[17:36] <Riddell> the Welcome page has a "Start a new Project" tab
[17:36] <Riddell> http://www.flickr.com/photos/jriddell/6116798364
[17:37] <Riddell> I initialise a new project
[17:37] <Riddell> there's a few options for what sort of branch you want, Feature Branches is the best sort for most cases
[17:37] <Riddell> that'll make a shared repository and a trunk branch inside it
[17:38] <Riddell> http://www.flickr.com/photos/jriddell/6116798064
[17:38] <Riddell> this takes us to a new page which lists the available branches
[17:38] <Riddell> from here we can open a branch or make a new one
[17:39] <Riddell> as a new project working on trunk is expected so we can add our files http://www.flickr.com/photos/jriddell/6116254211
[17:39] <Riddell> and commit them http://www.flickr.com/photos/jriddell/6116253927
[17:39] <Riddell> http://www.flickr.com/photos/jriddell/6116797120
[17:39] <Riddell> and if I wanted I could push it to Launchpad or anywhere else
[17:40] <Riddell> <trinikrono> bazaar explorer is awesome!
[17:40] <Riddell> why thank you trinikrono, free hugs to you
[17:40] <Riddell> now I said that Bazaar is used throughtout Ubuntu
[17:41] <Riddell> we now have (almost) every ubuntu package kept in a Bazaar branch
[17:41] <Riddell> so you can use Bazaar Explorer to branch any Ubuntu package if you feel the need to fix it or otherwise look at the source code
[17:41] <Riddell> http://www.flickr.com/photos/jriddell/6116796880
[17:42] <Riddell> here I'm getting the code to Ubuntu's choqok package
[17:42] <Riddell> by branching   ubuntu:choqok
[17:42] <Riddell> which gives me the code to work on http://www.flickr.com/photos/jriddell/6116796608
[17:42] <ClassBot> bUbu87 asked: so upstream development just maps to pull requests on the package's launchpad branch?
[17:43] <Riddell> bUbu87: you're talking about the Ubuntu package branches?  Those are imports of packages in Ubuntu so they're not the upstream development branch
[17:43] <Riddell> so if you want to fix a problem which is specific to ubuntu then use those
[17:44] <Riddell> if it's a general problem in the program then use the normal upstream code whereeever that is kept
[17:45] <Riddell> Bazaar Explorer is a nice GUI which works along with your IDE or file manager/text editor for working with code in Bazaar branches
[17:45] <Riddell> there is a half way between the GUI and command line interfaces
[17:46] <Riddell> which is to launch QBzr commands directly from the command line
[17:46] <Riddell> so if you're into using command lines but want an easier way to, say, browse a branch history you can run
[17:46] <Riddell> bzr qlog
[17:46] <Riddell> instead of bzr log
[17:46] <Riddell> which will give you a GUi to look at the log
[17:47] <Riddell> I use this a lot whenever the history is more complex than straight commits
[17:48] <Riddell> the same goes for   bzr qcommit  or bzr qbranch
[17:48] <Riddell> it's a nice alternative for when the command line is showing its limitations
[17:48] <ClassBot> dpm asked: are there Bazaar Explorer packages for platforms other than Ubuntu? (e.g. Win, Mac...)
[17:49] <Riddell> if you install Bazaaron Windows the installer comes with explorer
[17:49] <Riddell> same for Mac I'm sure
[17:49] <Riddell> so it's actually the main UI for non-Linux users
[17:50] <Riddell> which is why if you follow the Take the Tour link on http://bazaar.canonical.com/en/  it shows you Bazaar Explorer
[17:50] <Riddell> that's all I have prepared, any other questions?
[17:50] <ClassBot> There are 10 minutes remaining in the current session.
[17:51] <ClassBot> bulldog98 asked: will there be a port to freedesktop icon usage?
[17:51] <Riddell> I see this is an important issue for you :)
[17:52] <Riddell> I think when Bazaar Explorer was started Tango was the obvious choice
[17:52] <Riddell> since then Oxygen has come along and the freedesktop icon standard is more available
[17:52] <Riddell> but I don't think freedesktop icons are built into Qt so there's a little bit of code needed there
[17:53] <Riddell> do file a bug if it's something you want done and hopefully we'll get round to iy
[17:53] <Riddell> it
[17:53] <ClassBot> dpm asked: apart from Bazaar Explorer, are there other recommended graphical tools? I.e. I know there's qbzr and bzr-gtk, but I don't know if picking one over the other is a matter of choice or whether there is a recommended one to use
[17:53] <Riddell> qbzr is the GUi for individual commands
[17:53] <Riddell> e.g.  bzr qlog
[17:54] <Riddell> when you ask Bazaar Explorer to show you the branch log it will run  QBzr's qlog
[17:54] <Riddell> you can also tell Bazaar Explorer to run bzr-gtk commands instead of QBzr if you really want
[17:54] <Riddell> but QBzr is generally better maintained and is the default
[17:55] <Riddell> the other main graphical tool is Loggerhead which is the web UI
[17:55] <ClassBot> There are 5 minutes remaining in the current session.
[17:55] <Riddell> elite Bazaar hackers recently changed that from spitting out HTML directly to spitting out JSON so it's now a lot more flexible as a way of making UIs
[17:56] <Riddell> e.g. Launchpad can now show you a recent changes diff for merge proposals
[17:56] <Riddell> there's some other UIs such as my own Dolphin Bazaar plugin for KDE's file manager
[17:56] <Riddell> and there's even some experimental integration with Qt Creator
[17:57] <ClassBot> bulldog98 asked: is there a graphical way to see my bazaar config, eg what bazaar plugins are run after a commit (cia-client?)
[17:57] <Riddell> The settings menu lets you change your Bazaar config
[17:58] <Riddell> but it doesn't do everything from a GUI
[17:58] <Riddell> User Configuration has your user setup
[17:58] <Riddell> but stuff like cia plugin config can only be done with editing a text file for now (Settings -> Locations)
[17:59] <Riddell> Bazaar Explorer is extendable so it should be possible for the bzr-cia plugin to add that
[17:59] <ClassBot> Mipixal asked: What about Bazaar branches that are mirrored from other sources (not hosted on Launchpad). Does pushing commits make them available only on Launchpad or to original sources  too ?
[18:00] <Riddell> it depends where you push them
[18:00] <Riddell> if you push them back to where you got it from then it'll be available in the same place
[18:00] <Riddell> if you push it to Launchpad it'll be available on Launchpad
[18:00] <Riddell> there's no fixed tie in between bzr and Launchpad
[18:00] <Riddell> it's just that Launchpad has been designed to work very well with Bazaar
|| Event: App Developer Week - Current Session: Your App and Launchpad best practices - Instructors: jderose
[18:00] <Riddell> time up!
[18:00] <dpm> Thanks Riddell for a really awesome session - even with pictures!
