== Main Inclusion Report for pcmciautils ==

=== Requirements ===

# Availability: http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/p/pcmciautils/, built on all supported architectures
# Rationale: Provides udev rules and helpers supporting PCMCIA on Linux >= 2.6.13-rc1.
# Security:
** Young package, no security history.
** Shallow source code review did not reveal obvious flaws.
# Quality assurance:
# Standards compliance:
# Dependencies:
** All in main

=== Reviewers ===
MartinPitt: approved

Two questions:
# Why don't you ship the /etc/udev/85-pcmcia.rules symlink directly in the package? with this, the maintainer scripts could be dropped, and use dpkg's usual conffile logic would do the right thing
# 60-pcmcia.rules, first rule: this just calls /sbin/modprobe $modalias; isn't that already done by (the future) udev default rules?
