== Main Inclusion Report for svgalib ==

=== Requirements ===

# ''Availability:'' http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/s/svgalib, available for i386 and amd64
# ''Rationale:''
** Build dependency of usplash in order to provide high-resolution vesa support
** Should only include libsvga1 and libsvga1-dev - binaries are unnecessary
 0. ''Security:''
** 3 <nowiki>[[http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=svgalib|CVE issues]]</nowiki> in the past
** No binaries running as root or suid/sgid, except in svgalib-bin package (not requested for inclusion); however, we generally support all binaries from a source package, so these need to be dealt with.
** Does not open any port.
 0. ''Quality assurance:''
** Package works out of the box without configuration.
** Package does not ask any debconf questions higher than priority 'normal'.
** No showstopper <nowiki>[[http://bugs.debian.org/src:svgalib|Debian bugs]]</nowiki>, but lots of hardware specific crashes.
** Good <nowiki>[[http://packages.qa.debian.org/s/svgalib.html|maintenance in Debian]]</nowiki>.
** Upstream is approximately dead, large chunks of the code are rotten
** Claims (but tends to fail) to deal with ancient hardware which we cannot support.
 0. ''Standards compliance:'' 
** Meets the <nowiki>[[http://www.pathname.com/fhs/|FHS]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[http://www.de.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/|Debian Policy]]</nowiki>
** Meets <nowiki>[[http://www.netfort.gr.jp/~dancer/column/libpkg-guide/libpkg-guide.html|Debian library packaging guide]]</nowiki> standards.
** Standard debhelper packaging, custom, but reasonable patch system.
 0. ''Dependencies:''
** All in main.

=== Comments ===

<pre>
<mdz> mjg59: the primary reason we keep it out of main is to prevent nasty suid binaries from creeping in through other packages
<mjg59> mdz: Right
<mdz> mjg59: though the main inclusion process should prevent that just as well nowadays
 except where Debian introduces something without our knowledge
<mjg59> mdz: To be honest, I'd be quite tempted to say that we can't support all of its code
<mjg59> But the chances of anyone actually having hardware old enough that svgalib claims to support it (other than through vesa) is, well, small
<mdz> mjg59: would it be feasible to copy the bits you need into usplash, as with bogl?
<mjg59> mdz: Not in any remotely trivial manner
<mjg59> The build system is a nightmare
* jsgotangco (n=jsg123@ubuntu/member/jsgotangco) has joined #ubuntu-devel
<mdz> I'd like to find a way to let it into main for usplash without exposing us to any potential evils
<mjg59> Sure
<mdz> maybe I'm paranoid; it's probably unlikely that new suid programs are popping up due to svgalib
 in this day and age
 one would hope

=== Reviewers ===
MartinPitt: traditionally we support source packages, so the suid-ness should be either removed or thorougly audited. TBH I'm not happy about this package at all, and I feel that a hi-res boot splash does not really justify having to support this package. If this is covered by an approved spec, or mdz explicitly approves this updated report, so be it; otherwise I veto.
