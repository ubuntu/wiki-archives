=== Welcome! ===
This is the wiki page of the Myanmar Local Community Team. We aim to provide free community support to users of the various flavours of Ubuntu as well as advocating the use of Ubuntu to individuals and organisations alike. We keep in touch via our active <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-mm|email list]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[MMTeam-IRC| IRC chatroom]]</nowiki>. This group is for anyone in the Myanmar (but we welcome non-UK residents) who uses or is interested in some flavour of Ubuntu, whether it's Ubuntu, Kubuntu or any others. This group is for people of all technical abilities from I've-never-heard-of-linux all the way to I'm-an-Ubuntu-Master.

=== How do I join? ===
There is no official process to join, however if you join the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/people/ubuntu-uk|launchpad team]]</nowiki> you are then able to vote in polls organised by the group. Discussion happens on the <nowiki>[[http://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-uk|mailing list]]</nowiki> which you are free to join. There is also an active group of members who chat in real time on <nowiki>[[UKTeam-IRC|IRC]]</nowiki> in the #ubuntu-uk channel on irc.freenode.net.

It would be nice if you could update the <nowiki>[[UKTeam-UKLugMembers| LUG Members Page]]</nowiki> if you are indeed a member of a LUG or <nowiki>[[UKTeam-OtherGroups| Other Groups Members Page]]</nowiki> if you are a member of any other Linux or Free Software related groups.

=== Meetings ===
Meetings for Ubuntu-UK usually happen once a month, in #ubuntu-uk-meeting on irc.freenode.net. The next scheduled meeting is <nowiki>[[http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?month=4&day=7&year=2010&hour=19&min=00&sec=0&p1=0|28th April 2010, 19:00 UTC (20:00 BST)]]</nowiki>
