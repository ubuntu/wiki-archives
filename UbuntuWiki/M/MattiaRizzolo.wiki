=== My relationship with GNU/Linux and Ubuntu ===
I met this world in 2009 and tried different distributions in VMs.
A year later, exasperated by some problems Windows® XP was giving to me and after an attack of madness on the immaculate partition table, I created a dual boot Windows/Ubuntu.
Almost mono-operating system (just a small partition for Windows to use owned programs) from December 2010. From the middle of 2011 I added Debian GNU/Linux in dual-boot with Ubuntu. From the start of 2012 I also added !ArchLinux, but Ubuntu still was my main distro. Fast forward to 2013, 6 months old computer, and I got rid of Windows: only Ubuntu (usually the Ubuntu+1 one or the latest relase), Debian (sid) and !ArchLinux (for seldom experiment) are left.

My main contributions are usually hidden to normal humans: I love logistic activities, so I take care of wiki pages, reorder shared directories,....

=== Meetings ===

* I attended the Ubuntu-it meeting of <nowiki>[[http://wiki.ubuntu-it.org/UbuntuItMeeting/20121117|17th November 2012]]</nowiki>.
* I attended the <nowiki>[[http://www.ducc.it|DUCC-IT]]</nowiki> of <nowiki>[[http://ducc.it/minutes/2013|1st June 2013]]</nowiki>
* I attended the <nowiki>[[http://debconf15.debconf.org|DebConf 15]]</nowiki>

And several others, more or less important...

=== Future Plans ===

I'm currently a DD and a MOTU, which basically covers all of the main area of interests I have.  Nowadays most of the FOSS contributions are done in Debian rather than in Ubuntu, but that doesn't mean I've completely lost interest in Ubuntu.

I'm planning on applying for core-dev, since in Debian I do handle some basic packages (libxml, devscripts, strip-nondetermism, some TDF/LO libraries, etc) and from time to time I do need to touch those in Ubuntu as well, so my MOTU+PPU rights are starting to get tight.  Also with my role in the Backporters team, it feels weird to approve non-universe package when I don't have the right to upload them... :)
