__TOC__

I am a Debian and Ubuntu maintainer.

I have deleted my info here. I am no longer available for consulting or programming in Ubuntu-related areas – partly because my plate is full, partly because too many idiots call me on the phone (you didn't think there was a reason why my phone number never was on this page, did you?) but mostly because I think that the strategy Canonical is pursuing is a disservice to the Linux community and won't work in the long run.

Sorry.
