=== Minutes ===

==== Review ACTION points from previous meeting ==== 

Two action items were completed, one was apparently invalid.

==== W Development ==== 

Of the two high priority server bugs, one was already fixed, and one is deemed pretty easy - smoser will triage.

===== Kernel Updates =====

Arges is debugging a kernel bug impacting nested kvm.

==== Open Discussion ==== 

An "Upcoming CFP" section is being added to the meeting, since often "upcoming server events" are past CFP before they are brought up here.  Everyone is encouraged to mention here any events for which they are considering submitting a paper in the next two weeks.

===== Agree on next meeting date and time =====

Next meeting will be on Tuesday, June 30th at 16:00 UTC in #ubuntu-meeting.

 16:04 <rharper> hallyn_: right, filed ticket and found the correct owner of qa.reqorts who fixed the issue;  if it happens again, we follow up with Brian Murray

 16:04 <rharper> hallyn_: issue resolved

 16:04 <hallyn_> rharper: excellent, thanks

 16:04 <rharper> np

 16:04 <hallyn_> . smoser update Topic blueprint URLs, if necessary

 16:04 <hallyn_> uh, is that in the mtg page?

 16:05 <smoser> well, we've got nothing there.

 16:05 <hallyn_> yeah

 16:05 <smoser> so arosales quite reasonably asked 'why'

 16:05 <hallyn_> ignore?

 16:05 <smoser> ..

 16:05 <hallyn_> all right, not deferring

 16:05 <rharper> need to fill those out ...

 16:05 <hallyn_> . hallyn to see if rbasak is willing to take this (nginx version in 15.10 and looking to 16.04) to release team, if not hallyn to volunteer, to come up with options

 16:05 <hallyn_> done, and rbasak sent an email about it this morning - thanks rbasak

 16:05 <rbasak> I emailed the release team this morning.

 16:07 <ubottu> bug 1461242 in cloud-init (Ubuntu Wily) "cloud-init does not generate ed25519 keys" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1461242

 16:08 <hallyn_> smoser, any update there?

 16:08 <hallyn_> i se eit has an assignee

 16:08 <hallyn_> so let's move on to bug 1453160

 16:08 <ubottu> bug 1453160 in openstack-manuals "[SRU] missing binaries in Ubuntu heat packages" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1453160

 16:09 <hallyn_> is that zul?  jamespage ?

 16:09 <hallyn_> oh it's fixed,

 16:09 <jamespage> hallyn_, is in proposed - just needs verification - I'll look

 16:09 <hallyn_> but that should be 'fix releasd' in wily no?

 16:09 <hallyn_> thanks jamespage

 16:09 <hallyn_> smoser: jamespage: anything more to discuss on W devel?

 16:09 <jamespage> oh actually its done - its just held up in the general foo going on in wily proposed right now

 16:09 <smoser> hallyn_, no update on that bug. alghouh that is reasonably asy.

 16:10 <smoser> i'll triage.

 16:10 <hallyn_> cool thx

 16:10 <jamespage> hallyn_, oh - I fixed up the junit4 main explosion - but its taking a day or two to ripple through

 16:10 <jamespage> libreoffice takes time to build apparently

 16:10 * hallyn_ doesn't know what that is but is happy with the last part of the sentence :)

 16:11 <hallyn_> so, moving on/  (in 3, 2,)

 16:11 <hallyn_> #topic Server & Cloud Bugs (caribou)

 16:11 <caribou> nothing here, I'm good

 16:11 <hallyn_> any qs for caribou ?

 16:11 <hallyn_> (in 3, 2, )

 16:12 <hallyn_> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the QA Team (matsubara)

 16:12 <matsubara> nothing new from me.

 16:12 <hallyn_> thanks, waiting 30 secs for any qs for you,

 16:12 <matsubara> sure

 16:12 <hallyn_> moving on,

 16:12 <hallyn_> #topic Weekly Updates & Questions for the Kernel Team (smb, sforshee, arges)

 16:12 <smb> no news either

 16:13 <hallyn_> qs for kernel team?

 16:13 <arges> hallyn_: workin on your nested bug fyi

 16:13 <arges> finally

 16:13 <hallyn_> arges: oh, cool.  i'm really quite surprised on the range of kernels affected

 16:13 <hallyn_> s/on/at/

 16:13 <arges> yea, i'm wondering why i'm not hearing more complaints

 16:13 <hallyn_> maybe nested isn't as ubiquitous as we thought

 16:14 <hallyn_> ok, looks like no more qs, so moving on,

 16:14 <hallyn_> #topic Ubuntu Server Team Events

 16:14 <arges> yup

 16:14 <hallyn_> containercon is going on...  any upcoming events?

 16:15 <hallyn_> (this section seems weird to me, bc events 1 month away are too far, but 1 week away are too late to get travel for)

 16:15 <hallyn_> (maybe we shoul dhave a 'upcoming CFP' section0

 16:15 <hallyn_> #topic Open Discussion

 16:15 <rharper> hallyn_: +1 on CFP

 16:15 <smoser> hallyn_, that is a good suggestion.

 16:15 <hallyn_> in place of upcomign events, or in addition to?

 16:15 * smoser doesnt know if there is a tupperware-con coming up or not.

 16:16 <smoser> in addition to.

 16:16 <smoser> or along side of

 16:16 <hallyn_> seems like there are a lot of sections already - i'll consider adding it when updating the meeting page

 16:16 <hallyn_> any other general discussion items?

 16:16 <hallyn_> heck, lets' go back a step

 16:17 <hallyn_> #topic upcoming CFPs

 16:17 <hallyn_> anyone have anything they're submitting to in the next week?

 16:17 <hallyn_> looks like no.  (linuxcon.eu cfp just closed last week)

 16:17 <hallyn_> ok, closing out then,

 16:17 <hallyn_> #topic Announce next meeting date, time and chair

 16:18 <hallyn_> That'll be rbasak chairing next Tuesday, June 30 at 16:00 UTC
