Learning more about the wiki is On The List...

Now running Edgy on my poor old laptop (Thinkpad celeron 400, 160M ram), and dual booting the main desktop machine (K6-2/500). 

Mixed reviews on the desktop machine, looks like dual-boot with Windows 9x for the scanner and little camera.

Laptop is working out surprisingly well, even win-modem (lucent) works, and wireless. Downside is that machine has max video resolution of 800x600, seems to be some limits there, so far with Evolution (which I don't use anyway, just testing) and X-chat preferences screens. I think it is a Metacity problem, looking at that more soon, seems to work correctly running Openbox as a wm.
