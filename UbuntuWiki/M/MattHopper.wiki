=== About Me ===

I have been an Ubuntu user since 8.04 I believe. And I am just that. An everyday user. I have grown to appreciate the mission and philosophy of Ubuntu and am wanting to spread the same to those in my community who are interested. I live near Springfield, Missouri and work as a Medical Laboratory Scientist in one of the local hospitals. Not too many people I know are aware of Ubuntu and I'm hoping the Ubuntu MissouriTeam LoCo can help change that.
