** chromium regression: password database can't be accessed after upgrade. Upstream hasn't moved on it at all. May fix in the future at which point will have 2 password databases that are out of sync. Poor user experience and support provided by upstream. Will issue update anyway.
*** [ACTION] micahg to coordinate practicality of NEWS file with fta and adjust changelog
** pending updates
* Miscellaneous and Questions
** hardy desktop eol May 12th
** performance reviews are entered into the system
** UDS topics: for now just keep individual lists for what to bring forward/review/add
** apparmor in Debian
** enable in kernel and ship a reduced userspace? jjohansen says that should be fine
** Debian won't enable AppArmor because it can't be compiled as a module. LSMs can't be compiled as modules, so non-starter. This is an odd stance since they have selinux compiled in, no tomoyo in the kernel but with tomoyo userspace, and neither AppArmor kernel or userspace
** usn microsite
