| Actually i will still be talking a bit since i have my tablet here
| 
| 01:04
|-
| tsimonq2

| or have you found out something cool that you can do with your Ubuntu machine, mikeputnam?
| 
| 01:04
|-
| tsimonq2
| 
| adueppen: same goes for you :)
| 
| 01:04
|-
| mikeputnam
| 
| i've been tinkering on a python rss/atom feed parser thing that will hopefully incite people to edit a wiki by way of playful competition
| 
| 01:04
|-
| tsimonq2
| 
| ooh, fun :)
| 
| 01:05
|-
| adueppen
| 
| I've been working on Google Code-in
| 
| 01:05
|-
| adueppen
| 
| And I made my wiki page
| 
| 01:05
|-
| tsimonq2
| 
| mikeputnam: you have anything to link us, or are you just describing the concept? :)
| 
| 01:05
|-
| tsimonq2
| 
| adueppen: yay! link?
| 
| 01:05
|-
| mikeputnam
| 
| backstory: i wrote an emailer script (python) that i run on a weekly cron that looks up a google calendar for the current week's events and sends an email to our Makerspace's mailing list
| 
| 01:05
|-
| adueppen
| 
| http://wiki.ubuntu.com/adueppen I think that's the right link, i
| 
| 01:06
|-
| tsimonq2
| 
| oh that's pretty SWEET, mikeputnam :D
| 
| 01:06
|-
| mikeputnam
| 
| just adding the wiki stuff to that
| 
| 01:06

| Had ti hand-type that
| 
| 01:06
|-
| adueppen
| 
| To*
| 
| 01:06
|-
| tsimonq2
| 
| adueppen: cool :D
| 
| 01:06
|-
| tsimonq2
| 
| adueppen: you might want to add a little more content, it looks a bit blank
| 
| 01:07
|-
| tsimonq2
| 
| and you would be surprised what you can put on there
| 
| 01:07
|-
| adueppen
| 
| I know, I'll be working on it this weekend
| 
| 01:07
|-
| tsimonq2
| 
| mikeputnam: any recommendations from you about adueppen's wiki page?
| 
| 01:07
|-
| mikeputnam
| 
| here is an example of the email output (before wiki)
| 
| 01:08
|-
| mikeputnam
| 
| - Make the Space! Monday 6:00PM-10:00PM

|-
| mikeputnam
| 
| that ^
| 
| 01:09
|-
| tsimonq2
| 
| mikeputnam: oh cool, so what have you been adding to it?
| 
| 01:09
|-
| tsimonq2
| 
| mikeputnam: will it now output to a wiki page?
| 
| 01:10
|-
| tsimonq2
| 
| or what?
| 
| 01:10
|-
| tsimonq2
| 
| mikeputnam: I just don't know how the wiki page aspect fits into this, that's all
| 
| 01:11
|-
| mikeputnam
| 
| it will read the Recent Changes RSS feed for our makerspace's wiki
| 
| 01:11
|-
| tsimonq2
| 
| oh cool :)
| 
| 01:11
|-
| mikeputnam
| 
| then show a "leaderboard" of who edited the most
| 
| 01:11
|-
| tsimonq2
| 
| ha that's cool
| 
| 01:11
|-
| mikeputnam
| 
| (hopefully inciting people to want to compete to edit more)
| 
| 01:12
|-
| tsimonq2
| 
| mikeputnam: speaking of leaderboards, look at what I am on top of for Xenial: <nowiki>[[http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/qatracker/reports/testers]]</nowiki>
| 
| 01:12
|-
| mikeputnam
|

| 
| 01:14
|-
| adueppen
| 
| Welp found an issue with the testing here
| 
| 01:14
|-
| tsimonq2
| 
| adueppen: ruh roh, what did you do?
| 
| 01:14
|-
| adueppen
| 
| The manual partitioning testcase
| 
| 01:14
|-
| tsimonq2
| 
| adueppen: talk to me in Hangouts
| 
| 01:15
|-
| tsimonq2
| 
| mikeputnam: besides the system requirements on the flavors being wrong, do you have anything to suggest for <nowiki>[[http://ubuntu-wisconsin.org/]]</nowiki>?
| 
| 01:16
|-
| tsimonq2
| 
| mikeputnam: my goal is to get it finished by our next meeting
| 
| 01:17
|-
| tsimonq2
| 
| mikeputnam: and adueppen is doing/did some artwork for it
| 
| 01:18
|-
| tsimonq2
| 
| it looks great so far :)
| 
| 01:18
|-
| mikeputnam
| 
| looking good!
| 
| 01:19
|-
| tsimonq2
| 
| yay!
| 
| 01:19
|-
| tsimonq2
| 
| mikeputnam: and if looking it over, you find a typo or something, here is the Github link: <nowiki>[[https://github.com/wisconsinlinux/wisconsinlinux.github.io]]</nowiki>
| 
| 01:20
|-
| mikeputnam
| 
| one piece of feedback: at first glance, i didn't notice the heading/menu and just saw the "work in progress" thinking there wasn't much to see
| 
| 01:20
|-
| mikeputnam
| 
| tsimonq2: that's the link to the one i maintain  ;)
| 
| 01:21
|-
| tsimonq2
| 
| mikeputnam: so how could that be fixed?
| 
| 01:21
|-
| tsimonq2
| 
| whoops wrong link, sorry :)
| 
| 01:21
|-
| mikeputnam
| 
| (well... we maintain)
| 
| 01:21
|-
| tsimonq2
| 
| <nowiki>[[https://github.com/ubuntuwisconsin/ubuntuwisconsin.github.io]]</nowiki>
| 
| 01:22
|-
| tsimonq2
| 
| heh I got it ;)
| 
| 01:22
|-
| tsimonq2
| 
| mikeputnam: I am going to put more information on the home page
| 
| 01:22
|-
| tsimonq2
| 
| mikeputnam: but any code suggestions?
| 
| 01:23
|-
| mikeputnam
| 
| totally subjective, but I'd put the http://ubuntu-wisconsin.org/AboutUbuntu/ first paragraph on the main page
| 
| 01:23
|-
| tsimonq2
| 
| that's my plan :)
| 
| 01:23
|-
| mikeputnam
| 
| and the "What does it look like?" section
| 
| 01:23
|-
| tsimonq2
| 
| yeah, I gotta go through and fix a couple things with those images :)
| 
| 01:24
|-
| tsimonq2
| 
| mikeputnam: but does that seem like all?
| 
| 01:24
|-
| mikeputnam
| 
| yes i think that would be a great start to a page that is aimed at non-ubuntu users.
| 
| 01:25
|-
| tsimonq2
| 
| ok :)\
| 
| 01:25
|-
| mikeputnam
| 
| check out ubuntu! here's what it is!
| 
| 01:25
|-
| tsimonq2
| 
| mikeputnam: on our next informal IRC meeting as well as the main monthly one, I am gonna ask for more input
| 
| 01:26
|-
| tsimonq2
| 
| but yeah, my goal is to be able to link a newbie to this and for them to walk out being able to install it and/or get support
| 
| 01:26
|-
| tsimonq2
| 
| that was the goal of the site, right?
| 
| 01:26
|-
| mikeputnam
| 
| yes i think so
| 
| 01:27
|-
| tsimonq2
| 
| ok, good
| 
| 01:28
|-
| tsimonq2
| 
| and speaking of the next meeting, I prepared a wiki page along with some agenda items
| 
| 01:28
|-
| tsimonq2
| 
| adueppen, mikeputnam: So maybe you should check it out and give feedback on the agenda items and the wiki page: <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MeetingLogs/WisconsinTeam/20160108]]</nowiki>
| 
| 01:29
|-
| tsimonq2
| 
| your choice
| 
| 01:29
|-
| tsimonq2
| 
| ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
| 
| 01:29
|-
| tsimonq2
| 
| mikeputnam: I also plan on working with adueppen to get the Quick Start page good to go
| 
| 01:30
|-
| tsimonq2
| 
| so I think that is it
| 
| 01:30
|-
| adueppen
| 
| and I'm still here doing QA if you need to say something to me
| 
| 01:31
|-
| tsimonq2
| 
| unless someone has another cool thing to link us to, I think we can conclude this little informal meeting
| 
| 01:31
|-
| tsimonq2
| 
| adueppen: ok :)
| 
| 01:31
|-
| tsimonq2
| 
| adueppen: just read the logs :)
| 
| 01:31
|-
| tsimonq2
| 
| ok, that seems to be it. thanks guys, and see you around! :)
