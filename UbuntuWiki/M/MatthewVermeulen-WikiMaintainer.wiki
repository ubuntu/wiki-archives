__TOC__

Basically since the inception of ubuntu-au, I have been giving a hand in keeping the AustralianTeam wiki up to date. The new page at AustralianTeam is just one of the things that I have done, if not the most obvious.

By asking to become the recognised wiki maintainer, I am not asking for extra rights/priveledges, nor do I want to restrict others who want to edit the wiki and help there. I just like to keep the wiki neat, and the Meeting pages, eg <nowiki>[[AustralianTeam/Meetings/2006Jun27]]</nowiki> up to date. This will also then allow me to, where necessary, clean up other people's work, without (hopefully) treading on too many toes.
