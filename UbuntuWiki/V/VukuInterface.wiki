== Versatile Useful Kubuntu Interface ==

=== Summary ===
VukuI is a concept/idea theme for Kubuntu Edgy. It has similiraities with the "Modern" theme from Mozilla Suite and shapes similar to the Crystal KDE theme.

=== Mock-ups ===

=== The design ===

I tryed to make the design simple, eye-candy and that could look good on multiple backgrounds. For example, the "lights" color could be changed by the user, but the title bar and kicker could stay white (or they could even be switched colors too). Also, I tryed to make a design that could be useful by itself. Although there is a problem: I don't know f it is possible to create all the elements I put in there.

==== The kicker ====

Here is where the design's useful part comes in. The kicker's "light" at the right acts as a separator between the task manager and the program icons, but it could also be a CPU load or crazy process monitor. If all is normal, it stays blue, but if there is something wrong, like an anormal CPU load or a program that does not respond, it turns red (or any user-defined color). The desktop manager blends within the kicker with it leaned look.

==== The title bar ====

The title bar is a bit similar to the kicker. On this one though, its "light" is used to spot the active window and inactive window. It may not be much, but it makes things uniform.

==== The splash screen ====

(See upper picture of the splash)

I posted this splash on the Ubuntu forums and I have been told that it was impossible to do with USplash. So unless another splash program is used or that the USplash isn't upgraded to have the functions needed by the design I have done, the splash itself is mostly scrapped. But the background could be used. I don't see a black background fit with the white look of the design.

==== Icons ====

No icons have been done up to now, I never done icons before. I may try to do some someday!

==== Controls ====

In the mockup, the Lipstik controls were used. I think they fit pretty well with the whole design. But I might do my own later.

=== The developement ===

I don't know how to make themes, I just made the mock-ups. I doubt I have the skills to put up together a theme like that. So if anybody is interested, go ahead! I will be more than happy to see how it goes in the future. I made this concept basically to give ideas to the Kubuntu artwork theme.

=== The files ===

Want to see what is under the hood? Here are the XCF files of the mock-up and the splash.
