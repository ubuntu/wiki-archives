Email: 
I have done my engineering in Computer Science. I first dived into Linux in November 2006 and ever since I've never looked back.

I am actively involved in Ubuntu Forums and try my best to participate in helping out new users' queries. Recently, I joined the Ubuntu Brainstorm moderator group which I'm looking forward to help in the development of Ubuntu.
