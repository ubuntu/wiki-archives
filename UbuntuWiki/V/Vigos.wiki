New breezy user, so hoping to learn and help out here. I'm mainly interested in Ubuntu on laptops. My own laptop is pretty old now:

 Dell Inspiron 8000
 Pentium III 800MHz, 256MB RAM, 60GB disk

As its slightly dated, I'm interested in installs that are not too resource hungry I'm also interested in security, and wireless networking. So I hope to be able to help out in these areas.
