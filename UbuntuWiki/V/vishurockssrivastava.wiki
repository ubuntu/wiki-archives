Hello, I am vishurockssrivastava.
I started off with Linux in October~November 2012 as I was interested in it and din't want to upgrade my Laptop to Windows 8 which I consider useless.
I have tried a lot of distributions and my personal favorites (in the order of liking, max to minimum) are:
1. Kubuntu 11.10 (which I left as it had just 18 month support)
2. Kubuntu 12.10 (less appealing than 11.10, the reason why I looked at other distros outside Kubuntu)
3. Ubuntu 12.04 (the LTS was a solution to Kubuntu 11.10. I wanted to try Ubuntu and give it a chance. As of January 2013, this is the distribution I have installed full time on my desktop. Initially, I hated it but once I got past the learning curve of getting used to the interface, I like it)
4. Linux Mint 14 and Backtrack 5 R3 (I like both but wouldn't give all my hard drive to them)
