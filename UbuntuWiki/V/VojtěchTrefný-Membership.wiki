Vojtech has got my full support. He is invaluable in our LoCo community. He is one of the principal reasons why our Czech LoCo community keeps moving forward. -- MartinBöhm , Kubuntu Developer, Czech LoCo member

Vojtech is the powerhorse of the Czech LoCo Team and has been for the past year or so. He is a great membership candidate. Without him, the Czech LoCo would be nothing. -- JendaVancura
