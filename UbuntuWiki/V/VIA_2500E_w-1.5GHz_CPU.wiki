The VIA PC-1 Mainboard PC2500E with the VIA C7-D 1.5GHz CPU works great with Ubuntu 7.10.  Initially made for gOS, gOS version 2 Rocket is still beta, therefore, Ubuntu 7.10 was installed.  gOS is based on Ubuntu.  Sound and Networking work great right out of the box.  So does Screen Resolution.  Any issues or questions, please email info@wolfland.net.  Sincerely, Dave, Wolfland Computers.
