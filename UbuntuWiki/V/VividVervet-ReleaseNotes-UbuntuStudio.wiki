__TOC__

== Changes for 15.04 ==

Aside from a bunch of updated packages, we now have a new meta package called ubuntustudio-audio-core, which has all the essential parts for an audio oriented installation.

For more details on the latest updates for our desktop, such as xfce 4.12 - much of it correlates with Xubuntu, and therefore, please have a look at the <nowiki>[[http://wiki.ubuntu.com/VividVervet/ReleaseNotes/Xubuntu|release notes for Xubuntu 15.04]]</nowiki>.
