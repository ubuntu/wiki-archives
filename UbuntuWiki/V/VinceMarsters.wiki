Linux/Ubuntu User Since - I have been using Linux on and off for nearly 10 years but have only recently been confident that Linux is suitable as a desktop replacement OS for Windows. Since Ubuntu 10.04 I have been running Ubuntu on 3 laptops (using VMPlayer to run a Windows VM for software I haven't been able to replace) and 2 Acer Aspire Revo R3600 Nettops which run as XBMC media centre machines.
