20:03:59 <jledbetter>	Poke.
20:06:06 <Jagged>	hi
20:06:40 <jledbetter>	Howdy :) I was just loading up the agenda.
20:08:14 <jledbetter>	Welcome all to the Virginia LoCo meeting. It looks like there's a really light agenda (0 items) so I'll take any items from the floor.
20:09:16 <Jagged>	I just have a brief mention.
20:09:39 <jledbetter>	Jagged, Fire away :)
20:09:46 <Jagged>	VTLUUG will be hosting an installfest on 10/17 on the Virginia Tech campus
20:10:51 <Jagged>	I'll be there aiding curious folk in installing linux on their laptop/tablets.
20:11:02 <Jagged>	That's about all I have :)
20:11:59 <jledbetter>	That sounds neat. Is it part of a big event at VT?
20:12:27 <Jagged>	No, unfortunately.
20:12:39 <Jagged>	We try to hold 1-2 installfests in the beginning of each semester.
20:13:07 <Jagged>	Then some brown-bag sessions to help users with linux particulars (bash, package management, etc.)
20:13:11 <jledbetter>	Hopefully you'll take pictures. I'm curious about the setup.
20:13:25 <Jagged>	We have those sessions in the weeks after an installfest generally
20:13:25 <jledbetter>	How successful are the brown-bags? Great idea.
20:13:44 <Jagged>	Depends on if we advertise free food :)
20:14:04 <jledbetter>	Heh. Yeah, I remember college ;)
20:14:27 <Jagged>	Participation from within the LUUG is generally decent at these events.  We normally see only a handful of new folk at a time.
20:15:23 <Jagged>	The VTLUUG has about 2-dozen or so regular members.
20:15:50 <jledbetter>	Nice. Do the other area LUGs come over too?
20:16:10 <Jagged>	No, we're a little spead out here in southwestern VA :)
20:16:27 <Jagged>	the VTLUUG is comprised of students, faculty, and the local community
20:17:43 <jledbetter>	I keep meaning to check in with the local schools to see if they have Linux groups but usually it's just ACM. We don't have as tech heavy of a place like VT.
20:18:23 <Jagged>	What region are you in?
20:19:10 <jledbetter>	Southeastern. So, I have ODU, CNU, Hampton University, some community colleges, Norfolk State in the area.
20:19:58 <Jagged>	I've got family in Yorktown :)
20:20:24 <jledbetter>	Lovely area. That's where I went to high school.
20:20:39 <Jagged>	hmmm my mom graduated from Tabb and my dad from York
20:20:55 <jledbetter>	Ah, rival schools. ;)
20:21:36 <Jagged>	ODU has a decent engineering program
20:22:40 <jledbetter>	Yes. Oh, and I forgot William & Mary. Oops. I know ODU and CNU have ACM clubs. I think York might have a Linux group.
20:24:16 <jledbetter>	I've thought about pinging them to see if they wanted someone outside to come in and say how ftw opensource is and/or talk about this thing called Ubuntu. But. Time is so tight.
20:24:36 <jledbetter>	jtatum_w, ping
20:24:53 <Jagged>	Yeah it is... so much to do, not enough time! :)
20:25:21 <jledbetter>	Yawp. Speaking of too much time and too little to do, I signed up for https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuOpenWeek
20:25:55 <Jagged>	Neat
20:26:18 <jledbetter>	Should be. It'll be my first time and I'm looking forward to seeing the /other/ side of lernid.
20:27:09 <Jagged>	Almost time for one of my favorite live podcasts... Linux in the Ham Shack :)
20:27:43 <jledbetter>	I haven't heard them. * checks
20:28:15 <Jagged>	A couple of linux geeks who happen to be ham radio geeks, too.
20:28:41 <jledbetter>	I think they were at SELF. Oh, they come "on air"? Hm.
20:28:45 <Jagged>	Met one of the hosts at SELF (he was on the table across from OO.O)
20:29:05 <Jagged>	next to FSF
20:29:27 <jledbetter>	Ah
20:29:42 <Jagged>	I don't listen to their published podcasts... their live show is a bit more 'raw'
20:31:11 <jledbetter>	I have joined cause I'm curious. Oh. Not sure if I finished setting up for sound. Hm. Running in a vm on my win desktop.
20:31:51 -->	tarvid (~tarvid@dpc6935164141.direcpc.com) has joined #ubuntu-us-va
20:32:06 <jledbetter>	Yep, looks like I am soundless.
20:32:09 <jledbetter>	tarvid, Howdy :)
20:32:18 <tarvid>	Back from church, sorry I'm late, what's happening
20:33:14 <jledbetter>	Welcome! Jagged was filling us in on what he's doing up at VT. I was just looking for Linux in the Ham Shack which is starting soon.
20:33:45 <Jagged>	(and by soon... in 45 minutes... but they generally start ustreaming a bit before then)
20:34:41 <jledbetter>	Well, considering I'm not sure why sound is not working, that's really soon ;) * poke poke poke *
20:34:45 <tarvid>	VT is relatively close
20:34:54 <Jagged>	tarvid: oh yeah?
20:35:11 <tarvid>	80 miles or so
20:35:19 <Jagged>	Lexington?
20:35:34 <jledbetter>	raar... got sound
20:35:58 <tarvid>	OOOOOOh a bit further but I will be passing through Friday on the way to NOVA
20:36:14 <Jagged>	oh, you're farther south?
20:36:15 <tarvid>	jledbetter, what was it?
20:36:24 <tarvid>	Near Galax
20:36:33 <Jagged>	Yeah, gotcha
20:36:38 <jledbetter>	tarvid, Had to connect to sound via the vm
20:37:03 <tarvid>	Don't do much of that
20:37:09 <Jagged>	well, I'm right off the interstate here (literally 2 miles from exit 118)
20:37:11 <Jagged>	:)
20:37:17 <tarvid>	Looking into LXC
20:37:26 <jledbetter>	LXC?
20:37:33 <tarvid>	about 78 miles from here
20:37:37 <tarvid>	Linux containers
20:37:44 <jledbetter>	Ah
20:37:49 <tarvid>	sort of super chroot
20:38:01 <Jagged>	I really want to figure out how to virtualize =\
20:38:06 <Jagged>	servers, that is
20:38:27 <tarvid>	Did some virtual box and free vmware
20:38:30 <jledbetter>	I'm just using vmware. It was easy and I like the easy so I can just get to codin'
20:38:32 <Jagged>	Spent $60 at the surplus auction and came home with 6U of servers
20:38:48 <Jagged>	yeah.. I want console virtualization
20:38:55 <tarvid>	Sounds like something I would enjoy
20:38:59 <Jagged>	I have this decrepid email server on an old desktop machine
20:39:08 <Jagged>	and I really want to migrate to a legitimate serverbox
20:39:24 <Jagged>	but if I'm going to do that, I want to virtualize it so I can "move" the email server easier
20:39:36 <tarvid>	I recently upgraded some stuff, some of it in 4u enclosures
20:39:45 <tarvid>	I think that's wise
20:40:21 <Jagged>	the box the email server is going into a dual P3 machine
20:40:30 <tarvid>	I run one postfix server but push all my users onto Gmail
20:40:43 <Jagged>	redundant PSUs, 3 10k RPM scsi drives
20:40:58 <tarvid>	I had that urge once with old Compaq iron. I got over it.
20:41:11 <tarvid>	More than enough
20:41:13 <Jagged>	I use gmail for everything but my own personal domains
20:41:46 <jledbetter>	I use gmail for my personal domains.
20:42:07 <tarvid>	I host a few mail lists with mailman
20:42:13 <tarvid>	top
20:42:22 <tarvid>	wrong window
20:42:24 <Jagged>	:P
20:44:00 <tarvid>	https://www.bijk.com/p/2199b5ea is a graph of the main server
20:44:34 <jledbetter>	Helen, eh?
20:44:50 <jtatum_w>	hello all, sorry i am late
20:45:22 <tarvid>	welcome
20:45:48 <tarvid>	helen was a server originally destined for Sparta
20:45:54 <jledbetter>	jtatum_w, It's ok. We volunteered you to organize the release party this weekend.
20:46:04 <jledbetter>	Ha. Sparta. Nice.
20:46:27 <tarvid>	horace was the machine at home (Rome)
20:46:39 <jtatum_w>	oh no, i've been voluntold :(
20:46:52 <tarvid>	more into beauty and poetry than Greek Gods
20:47:48 <tarvid>	helen is a quad core AMD and just loafs. Occasional frenzy with the mailing lists
20:48:15 <tarvid>	handles a few hundred connections with relative ease.
20:48:36 <jtatum_w>	has anyone updated a maverick install recently? apparently the new font is the default UI font
20:48:56 <tarvid>	stuffing enough memory in the old P3 boxes would be a challenge but most of my memory goes into web serving and database
20:49:02 <jtatum_w>	by now generally all my machines are running the new vers since things tend to be fairly stable 5 days out
20:49:17 <tarvid>	Hope they go better than Lucid
20:49:22 <jledbetter>	jtatum_w, I am still on lucid. Hm.
20:49:37 <jledbetter>	I could fire up another vm and check it out to preserve my lamp
20:49:39 <jtatum_w>	i didn't have much trouble with lucid... but i'm not running P3s :)
20:49:47 <tarvid>	Mostly graphics issues
20:49:50 <jtatum_w>	jledbetter, could take a snapshot too :)
20:50:05 <jledbetter>	jtatum_w, * takes a picture with the phoen * Ok
20:50:33 <tarvid>	Have a couple of P3 boxes which required heroics to get X working
20:50:52 <Jagged>	I tend to leave P3s on a console
20:51:22 <Jagged>	heck, the email 'server' I have now is an old P4.... RDRAM and whatnot
20:51:24 <tarvid>	Good idea. One of these is a loaner.
20:51:57 <tarvid>	Got one of those too. Bought it from state surplus.
20:52:59 <tarvid>	Gateway. I've been satisfied with the P4 Dells from surplus and I got the Gateway 850 mobo running but it wasn't pleasant.
20:53:52 <Jagged>	Yeah, two of the servers I bought at surplus were Dells... but they're both P3s
20:54:10 <Jagged>	one of them has a SCSI backplane with an attitude though
20:54:10 <tarvid>	I usually wind up parting out the old RDRAM boxes for memory for guys like you
20:54:49 <Jagged>	I just stole the 2GB of ECC RAM out of it to put into the other machine
20:54:58 <tarvid>	The old Compaqs had no real ROM BIOS, just enough to boot the BIOS on hard disk
20:55:20 <tarvid>	Worth more dead than alive
20:55:51 <tarvid>	ECC ram is cheap on Ebay
20:56:00 <Jagged>	$5 ?
20:56:12 <tarvid>	~$10 per GB
20:56:16 <jledbetter>	Please continue discussing but unless there's any more Ubuntu foo, I'm going to close the log here. Any more foo?
20:56:24 <jtatum_w>	geez. i guess i'm spoiled. i get mad when i'm on a core duo.
20:56:46 <tarvid>	It's all Ubuntu
20:56:47 <Jagged>	tarvid: I got the whole server for $5 no one wanted it because it had no drives
20:56:50 <Jagged>	:)
20:57:00 <jtatum_w>	thanks for running a great meeting, mr jledbetter
