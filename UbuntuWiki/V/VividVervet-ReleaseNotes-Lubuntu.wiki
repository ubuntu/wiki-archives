=== System Requirements ===

Lubuntu is a good operating system for many old computers, but not for all of them. Some computers have too little horsepower or memory. A rule of thumb is that the computer should not be more than 10 years old.

'''Memory (RAM)'''

For advanced internet services like Google+, Youtube, Google Docs and Facebook, your computer needs at least '''1 GB RAM'''.

For local programs like Libre Office and simple browsing habits, your computer needs at least '''512 MB RAM'''.

'''Processor (CPU)'''

The minimum specification for CPU is Pentium 4 or Pentium M or AMD K8.

Older processors are too slow and AMD K7 has problems with flash video.

'''Graphics chip / card'''

Nvidia, AMD/ATI/Radeon and Intel work out of the box, or the system can be tweaked to work fairly easily. You can get help at the <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org|Ubuntu Forums]]</nowiki>. With such graphics, or if you don't know, try the current Lubuntu version.
