== What is Ubuntu Kylin ? ==

The objective of the Ubuntu Kylin project is to create a variant of Ubuntu that is more suitable for Chinese users. We are committed to provide you with a delicate, thoughtful and fully customized Chinese user experience out-of-the-box. For instance, by providing a desktop user interface localized in Chinese and installing common software that Chinese users commonly use by default. Ubuntu Kylin has been a formal member of the Ubuntu family, since <nowiki>[[UbuntuKylin | Ubuntu Kylin]]</nowiki> 13.04. Now, we are working on 15.04.

== What's new in Ubuntu Kylin 15.04 Beta 2 ==

/!\ '''Note:''' ''this is a beta pre-release, which is not suitable for normal users, but for Ubuntu Kylin developers and users who want to help us test by finding, reporting, and fixing bugs.''

We are glad to announce the Release of Ubuntu Kylin 15.04 (codename Vivid Vervet) Beta 2. In this pre-release, we have fixed many internationalization and localization bugs in Ubuntu itself and bugs in software written by the Ubuntu Kylin team. All the work that Ubuntu Kylin team do is within the Ubuntu community and ecosystem and as such they are flowed back to Ubuntu itself naturally and everyone using Ubuntu can benefit the result of our work.

=== Changes since 14.10 ===

In 15.04 Beta 2, we have turned on LIM (locally-integrated menu) and "click to minimize" on by default. These two new features will make Windows users easier to adapt to the Unity user interface.

We have also released <nowiki>[[http://pinyin.sogou.com/linux/ | Sogou Pinyin]]</nowiki> 1.2 on Feb 2. It is not included in the Beta 2 image by default, but you can install it easily from the Ubuntu Kylin Software Center.

The bug that USB stick will not boot if you write 14.04 image by usb-creator in 15.04 (bug #<nowiki>[[http://pad.lv/1325801|1325801]]</nowiki>) is finally fixed.
