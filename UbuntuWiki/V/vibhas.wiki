Subject: Introducing Vibhas Goyal
To: ubuntu-beginners@lists.ubuntu.com

Hello,

My name is Vibhas Goyal, and I want to contribute in the Ubuntu community.
I was amazed by the options of creativity given to everyone by Ubuntu. 
I am interested in joining the Ubuntu Beginners Team. I believe that I can help with the group, with my creativity in developing applications . Initially , I am having some difficulties in Setting up my computer and using the new-to-me python language.

Thanks,
Vibhas Goyal
