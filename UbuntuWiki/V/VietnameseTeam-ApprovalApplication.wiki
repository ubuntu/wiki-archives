== Roadmap ==
Our long-term goal is to bring Ubuntu to computer users in Viet Nam, so everyone can use their computer without violating copyrights which, sadly, is very popular in our country. Some more detailed goals are:
* Promoting the use of Ubuntu to end-users, government and educational institutions in Vietnam, especially end users and educational sectors, since we are mostly young people that can spend time volunteering for such purposes.
* Participating in other FOSS related events with other FOSS communities in Vietnam that have the same goal.
* Providing support and resources to people who are interested in Ubuntu or FOSS in general.
* Sharing the knowledge, the value of free libre software between our member, improving our skill so we can contribute more to the developement of FOSS world.

And some of our current plans is

*** To introduce Ubuntu and OpenSource Software for Education on 08/05/2010 at "Ba Ria Vung Tau College of Pedagogy"   (<nowiki>[[http://forum.ubuntu-vn.org/viewtopic.php?f=39&t=8884|Dicussion in Vietnamese]]</nowiki>), where we'll point out why we should use Ubuntu in Education, how to use it, and of course, give away "free as in freedom" Ubuntu CDs - <nowiki>[[http://forum.ubuntu-vn.org/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=10749|Pham Hoai Thuong]]</nowiki>, Le Kien Truc

*** To help deploying Ubuntu at high schools. A student had an idea to deploy Edubuntu at his high school (Trần Hưng Đạo high school). He has already convinced his teachers and principals of it, and asked our community for supporting. The task will begin this summer.  (<nowiki>[[http://forum.ubuntu-vn.org/viewtopic.php?f=97&t=8561|Dicussion in Vietnamese]]</nowiki>) - Nguyen Vu Hoang

As you can see, these ideas came not only from the core team but also from other community members as well. We hope in the future we will have more ideas and plans from our growing memberbase.

<nowiki>[[http://forum.ubuntu-vn.org/viewtopic.php?f=39&t=8529|Next release parties]]</nowiki> would be organized by:

- In Ha Noi - <nowiki>[[http://forum.ubuntu-vn.org/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=834|Le Chi Hieu]]</nowiki>

- In Ho Chi Minh City - <nowiki>[[http://forum.ubuntu-vn.org/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=359|Nguyen Lam Linh Trang]]</nowiki>

== Experience ==

*** <nowiki>[[http://forum.ubuntu-vn.org/viewtopic.php?f=41&t=5110|Software Freedom Day 2009]]</nowiki>

We are co-organizers of <nowiki>[[http://sfd.saigonlug.org/organizers/sponsor/|Sai Gon Software Freedom Day 2009]]</nowiki> with SaiGonLug at HCMC University of Pedagogy. In this event, we set up <nowiki>[[http://lh4.ggpht.com/_aLbiI7q0F1c/S8GqWNRWGhI/AAAAAAAADXI/xohXCWNPLXA/s720/dsc_0037.jpg|20 computers with Ubuntu preinstalled]]</nowiki> with the help of <nowiki>[[http://forum.ubuntu-vn.org/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=436|Tran Xuan Huy]]</nowiki> so that people can try it  <nowiki>[[http://picasaweb.google.com.vn/afterlastangel/SaiGonSoftwareFreedomDay2009#|More picture]]</nowiki>, Le Kien Truc.

*** FOSS Deployment:

The principal of Van Ban 2 high school had contacted us before we collaborated with HaNoiLug to deploy free open source software at that school in <nowiki>[[http://du-an-most.hanoilug.org/MostWiki/VanBan2|Lao Cai]]</nowiki>  (sponsored by MOST fund)  <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu-vn.org/node/450|picture]]</nowiki> - <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~khanhpt|Phan Trong Khanh]]</nowiki> and Vu Duc Phuong

*** <nowiki>[[http://2009.gnome.asia/|GNOME ASIA SUMMIT 2009]]</nowiki>

Many of our members were volunteers of this event. We held Free Ubuntu training courses at this event - Le Kien Truc, Le Manh Kha, Tran Xuan Huy, Vo Minh Huy, Nguyen Quoc Thanh

*** We held many release parties in both Ha Noi and Ho Chi Minh City

<nowiki>[[http://picasaweb.google.com/mtrung87/UbuntuVn?feat=directlink#|9.04 in Ho Chi Minh City]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQrj8XcJ4OM|video]]</nowiki>

<nowiki>[[http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=28458&id=1583769465|9.10 in Ha Noi]]</nowiki>

<nowiki>[[http://forum.ubuntu-vn.org/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=6512&p=71934#p71934|9.10 in Ho Chi Minh City]]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[[http://forum.ubuntu-vn.org/viewtopic.php?f=99&t=5494&p=71879#p71879|discussion]]</nowiki>.

In these release parties, we bring blank CD and burn Ubuntu CD for those who can't download or have a new one. We also have some ''opensource'' gifts and give it to each other.

As you can see, we discuss together, share together and, of course, drink together. Our core team members often meet each other to participate in Open Source events.

* <nowiki>[[http://du-an-most.hanoilug.org/MostWiki|Mandatory Opensource Software Translation Project]]</nowiki>

Our Ministry of Science and Technology is the sponsor of this project. Together with the community we translated OpenOffice.org 3.1 and Ubuntu 9.10. We also have a plan to translate OpenOffice.org 3.3 and Ubuntu 10.04 LTS.

The Ubuntu's translation is done by <nowiki>[[https://edge.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-l10n-vi|Translation Team]]</nowiki> but the contributions from upstream is very important to complete this project.
