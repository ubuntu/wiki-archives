19:43:55 <tarvid>	tarvid is here with a pot of tea
19:44:32 <jledbetter>	Thank you
19:52:28 <tarvid>	Virtual tea is not as good as real hot tea, but should meet someday, tea and/or coffee is never far away
19:56:33 <jledbetter>	I actually got some tea today at the store. :)
20:05:34 <tarvid>	Loaded karmic on my laptop - mostly happy
20:05:48 <jledbetter>	Loaded it on my PC. First time user. Pretty impressed so far.
20:05:55 <jledbetter>	Actually, playing with it right now.
20:06:01 <tarvid>	gnumeric print to file broken but 13 debs from Sid fixes the problem
20:06:28 <tarvid>	Glad to here it is working for you
20:06:41 <tarvid>	Post to the list if you need help or have questions
20:07:07 <jledbetter>	Thank you :) I wish I had it on a laptop. I'd like to play with it / show it off at work
20:07:55 <jledbetter>	Is this the norm meeting? Chit chat about love of tea and ubuntu? ;)
20:09:05 <tarvid>	We should get organized but until we do anything goes
20:09:18 <tarvid>	We haven't gathered resources to allocate
20:09:24 <tarvid>	Nothing to fight about
20:09:32 <jledbetter>	Haha. Fight about. Haha.
20:15:12 <jledbetter>	I have also been enjoying the open world stuff. You?
20:15:40 <tarvid>	even on that other os
20:36:15 <dwidmann>	Hmm, it's 8 somethin', oops
20:36:22 <tarvid>	wb
20:36:30 <jledbetter>	Howdy
20:36:39 <dwidmann>	hiya
20:36:55 <tarvid>	hi 2u2
20:37:12 <dwidmann>	attendance seems better than last month :)
20:37:37 <tarvid>	say something inspiring
20:37:53 <jledbetter>	jtatum would be here but he's in a meeting
20:37:57 <dwidmann>	something inspiring
20:38:09 <tarvid>	phunnie
20:38:13 <jledbetter>	Using the Ubuntu Software Center and <3
20:38:57 <dwidmann>	Everybodies upgrades to 9.10 go okay?
20:39:12 <jledbetter>	I'm debugging sound atm
20:39:16 <tarvid>	one down, many to go
20:39:39 <dwidmann>	My solution to my broken sound was apt-get remove pulseaudio
20:41:10 <jledbetter>	Ok, trying that.
20:42:52 <dwidmann>	so how are things tarvid?
20:43:02 <tarvid>	busy
20:43:35 <tarvid>	lots of fiber and wireless
20:43:42 <dwidmann>	Othor: you around?
20:44:10 <dwidmann>	tarvid: busy = money = good yes?
20:44:23 <tarvid>	eventually
20:45:17 <Othor>	yeah i'm here just watching a podcast at the same time lol
20:46:35 <tarvid>	I've been watching our ISP business taper off but by a strange set of circumstances and in spite of the fact we are being used, we may benefit
20:46:56 <dwidmann>	thing that sucks about me being sick is that I'm constantly fatigued :( (just a cold or something, but still)
20:47:26 <dwidmann>	good luck with that then tarvid
20:47:41 <tarvid>	my metabolism is not what it should be. I usually lie down when I have the urge to exercise but I have been thinking about track shoes
20:48:13 <tarvid>	I think short bursts of exercise may be the trick
20:48:32 <dwidmann>	Possibly
20:48:39 <dwidmann>	A better idea than caffeine anyway
20:48:46 <Othor>	anyone know of a way to turn off the dialog that pops up when you restart/shutdown in 9.10?
20:49:21 <tarvid>	patch the script?
20:49:33 <tarvid>	is it in the menu system?
20:49:42 <Othor>	yeah in gnome
20:50:14 <Othor>	it says something like "your computer will reboot in 60 seconds" and counts down
20:50:20 <tarvid>	Ubuntu punted a bunch of gnome updates two weeks before release
20:50:42 <tarvid>	I see that as a game to see if I can hit the return key before 59
20:50:51 <jledbetter>	lol
20:50:52 <Othor>	lol
20:51:27 <tarvid>	13 debs from Sid to fix gnumeric
20:51:36 <Othor>	i feel that my computer should not question me. "YES SHUT DOWN WHY DO YOU THINK I CLICKED THAT!!!!"
20:51:43 <tarvid>	No regression tests
20:51:43 <Othor>	lol
20:52:16 <tarvid>	You could be asked to click start before shutdown before really shutdown
20:52:34 <Othor>	hahhah true
20:53:20 <tarvid>	wine is doing better, I have radio mobile running
20:53:24 <Othor>	i'm just confused why the option to disable that was taken out. it was there in 9.04
20:54:15 <tarvid>	And curiously Ubuntu One was broken in karmic and now it is broken in jaunty too. Took a backport to pull that one off
20:54:53 <Othor>	Ubuntu One is working for me
20:55:16 <tarvid>	Clean install on Karmic or update
20:55:23 <Othor>	update
20:55:32 <dwidmann>	tarvid: that's almost funny
20:55:34 <tarvid>	I get capabilities mismatch with server
20:56:06 <Othor>	they had it disabled for a while because of a bug that could cause you to lose data/files
20:56:31 <Othor>	do you have any update available?
20:56:40 <dwidmann>	I started off doing an upgrade ... then backed up my package cache and did a reinstall ... things are working much smoother (if I disregard all the configs I have to redo)
20:57:03 <dwidmann>	speaking of that, it seems I didnt botch up the postfix config :)
20:57:17 <tarvid>	postfix is pretty resilient
20:57:50 <tarvid>	less vulnerable than sendmail
20:58:38 <tarvid>	pull postconf in before making changes, postfix check afterwards
20:58:45 <dwidmann>	tarvid: well, I basically didn't back up any of my configs, with the one exception of ivman
20:58:46 <tarvid>	s/in/-n/
20:59:15 <tarvid>	I did the update on blind faith and got away with it
20:59:33 <tarvid>	the sandboxes seem free of drek
20:59:35 <Othor>	tarvid, here is the bug for that issue https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntuone-client/+bug/462828
20:59:50 <dwidmann>	So did I ... but things seem smoother/faster since the reinstall, for whatever reason
21:00:02 <tarvid>	Often the case
21:01:09 <dwidmann>	Does grub2 seem slow-to-load to anyone else? (for me it takes around 3-6 seconds, ish)
21:01:38 <dwidmann>	(not the legacy grub, but the new one)
21:02:30 <Othor>	idk i usually walk away from my computer when i reboot
21:03:47 <tarvid>	coffee, drain the radiator, clean the trash off my desk
21:04:11 <tarvid>	Anyone try openvz on ubuntu?
21:05:35 <dwidmann>	not me
21:05:52 <dwidmann>	... I'm sooooooooooooo sleepy x_x
21:06:05 <tarvid>	I have some clients that want shell
21:06:43 <tarvid>	now that vps is cheap, it is hardly worth selling
21:07:37 <tarvid>	but a few want the affinity/intimacy of a shared server and internet connection with someone who knows their name
21:19:25 <jledbetter>	Like Cheers?
21:19:36 <tarvid>	Exactly
21:21:19 <tarvid>	I look for ways our business can be more inclusive
21:27:59 <--	Othor has quit ("Leaving")
21:28:52 <tarvid>	Good to see you all this evening. Looking forward to our next chat.
