__TOC__

I started off with using Ubuntu Dapper, upgraded to Edgy when it was released and now trying out Feisty. With the help of the community, forum, managed to get everything I want working on my labtop, the only problem I have is with the 3D support of the graphics card. If you are also using Tecra S1 and experience any problem with Edgy or Feisty, feel free to contact me.
