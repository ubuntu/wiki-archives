I am a Kubuntu user, and its <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelism|evangelist]]</nowiki>.

The last few years I have been working with the Java language, therefore I would like to see more Java programs in the Ubuntu zone.

Perhaps I could find some time to help with "packaging", I like the idea of a Java application suite.
