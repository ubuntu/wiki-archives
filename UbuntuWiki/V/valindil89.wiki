=== About Me ===

==== The Radio Guy ====

I started pursuing and obtaining goals in the Amateur Radio field my freshman year of college. I obtained my Technicians license in the spring of 2009, and have proceeded to get involved in CAUHF(Central Arkansas Ultra High Frequency group). I run a remote link out of my house, that connects to radios in California and 3 parts of Arkansas. I also run a station out of my car with a Yeasu FT-8800. This hobby allows me to work with electrical, mechanical, and software engineering.

==== The Storm Guy ====

After I obtained my Ham Radio license, I took a course and became a registered storm spotter for the Nation Weather Service based out of Little Rock, AR. This allows me to report extreme weather circumstances to the NWS. I will also be part of any emergency severe weather response that takes place in the town I live. In addition to responding to severe weather, I am on-line with other spotters around the state using the <nowiki>[[http://www.warnim.com/warnim/|WarnIM Emergency Communication]]</nowiki> software in correlation to my Storm radar and analysis software to coordinate what exactly is going on weather wise during times of Sever Weather. 

==== The Programming Guy ====

In fourth grade I made a mistake. I started to play with programming and have never quit. For most of my early school years I dabbled in software but mainly stuck to strict html text editor for websites. Since then I have branched off into many different areas. I am familiar with the following:

Software:
* Adobe Dreamweaver
* Adobe Photoshop
* SMF Forum
* UltraEdit
* Notepad ++
* Gedit
* Code::Blocks
* Eclipse
* Dr. Java
* NetBeans
* MS Visual Studio
* WordPress
* Byond

 
Programming Languages:
* PHP
* HTML
* C
* C++
* ASM
* MIPS ASM
* Java

Libraries
* SDL 
* SDL_image
* SDL_ttf
* SDL_mixer
 
==== Life Story of a Guy ====

I was born and raised in Arkansas, United States. I played alot of video games growing up, and as a consequence I learned alot about windows. Most of my friends came over to my house for me to fix their computers. Changed high school in the 11th grade, and attended the Area Vocational School for Computer Engineering and Networking. Graduated high school from Pottsville, AR. I am now attending Henderson State University in Arkadelphia, AR for a BS degree in Computer Science. In December of 2009 I installed Ubuntu... Now I am here :-)
