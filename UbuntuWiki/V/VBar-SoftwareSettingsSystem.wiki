''Software touched: gnome-panel.''

The start represents the favourite applications (or the most used). The star is the replacement for the "Add to panel", allowing to quickly mark the application as a most used application, this way it can be opened without navigating in the software categories.

To save space, first showing the categoty list. When the user selects a category, the corresponding apps will be show.

On the second screen, the user can go back, mark the application as a frequent app (or favourite) or simply launch it.

The current HIG specification to name "Player & Volume Manager Player X", will be kept, showing also a small description of the application.

If there are too many apps to fit in the list, a numbered bar will let navigate trough thems (or maybe a scrollbar).

On the bottom is a special option, that implements Cannonical's idea of a centric place to manage installations, updates, etc.
