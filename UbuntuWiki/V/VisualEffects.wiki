__TOC__

Ubuntu provides options to control visual effects on the desktop using the ''System>Preferences>Appearance'' tool.  Some examples of these effects are:
* Drop shadows
* Window animations (e.g. minimising)
* Transparency

There are three levels of effects that can be chosen depending on your preference and the type and level of support for your computer.  Ubuntu attempts to make these effects work for everybody but performance will vary depending on the type of computer you have.

=== Problems ===
 
If you are experiencing problems when visual effects are enabled please try the following:
# '''Disable visual effects'''.  Visual effects are not required; choosing ''None'' will make your desktop look simpler but still be able to run all applications.
# '''Use ''Normal'' settings'''.  This setting provides the simplest and most tested settings.
# '''Update to the latest version'''.  Use the latest release of Ubuntu and keep up to date using ''Update Manager'' to ensure you have the most recent fixes.  Older versions of Ubuntu do not contain fixes for non-security issues.
# '''Report the problem'''.  Inform Ubuntu about the problem using the crash report tool or by using `ubuntu-bug compiz` from a terminal (''Applications>Accessories>Terminal'') if the problem is not a crash.  Please provide as much information as possible to help diagnose the problem.
