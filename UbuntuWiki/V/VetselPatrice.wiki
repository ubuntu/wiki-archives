=== Support ===
<nowiki>[[File:IconsPage/IconUsers.png]]</nowiki>

MartinPitt: I have known Patrice for a long time already. He has done great work with printing bug triage, helped to debug a few issues (cups and gnome printing stuff), and a lot of other small things. I welcome him to become an Ubuntu member. In fact I am quite surprised that he is not yet. :-)

DanielHolbach: As part of the DesktopTeam and the BugSquad I saw Patrice doing a lot of work and am quite glad that he's been around for such a long time. I hope that he'll become a <nowiki>[[MOTU]]</nowiki> soon and can help out the <nowiki>[[MOTU-Teams-Photo]]</nowiki>.

JeremieCorbier: Patrice has been around for a ''long'' time and I am quite surprised he is not a member yet. He has done a lot of triaging and helping with bugs and it has always been a pleasure working with him. 

YannHamon: As an Ubuntu-fr admin, I have seen Patrice around and active for a long time. His engagement in the Ubuntu-fr team increased a few months ago when he became planet admin. I support his membership as I think he is a longterm and reliable contributor.

TillKamppeter: I work on the printing infrastructure on Ubuntu and I am leading the OpenPrinting project at the Linux Foundation. Patrice helped me a lot by reporting important bugs on printing with Ubuntu and in contrary to many other bug reporters he supplied me quickly all information I needed, so that I could fix all bugs reported by him. I appreciate very much if he will be made a Ubuntu member and a MOTU, as I use also a lot of photo software on Ubuntu.

LionelDricot : Kagou was a very early Ubuntu user and was involved in the FR community since the beginning. I switched from Windows to Debian thanks to his forum and he never really stopped to help other people since then. He does a great job of vulgarisation and help on his blog and in the FR community.
