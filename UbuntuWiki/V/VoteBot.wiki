'''NAME'''

'''Vote''''''Bot''' - A simple IRC bot used in Free''''''Node's #ubuntu-beginners channel.

----
'''SYNOPSIS'''

perl ./voteBot.pl

----
'''DESCRIPTION'''

'''Vote''''''Bot''' is a simple IRC bot used in Free''''''Node's #ubuntu-beginners IRC channel and possibly in other rooms to establish some official form of voting. '''Vote''''''Bot''' includes public and private voting, and the public display of vote results. In addition to voting relating functions, '''Vote''''''Bot''' also prints the titles of URLs posted in the IRC channel and automatically warns users when compiledkernel post links as well as incorporates the ubotu database of factoids.

'''Vote''''''Bot''' is pre-release code and is by no means complete. Furthermore, it is to be expected that '''Vote''''''Bot''' will always be changing in functionality to meet the needs of the users and channels using the bot.
