<pre>
17:02:17 <jledbetter>	Welcome everyone. Figured we'd (jtatum) would give folks an extra minute to arrive.
17:02:35 <dasnipa|arpy>	good call
17:02:38 <jledbetter>	Did everyone have a chance to look at the agenda?
17:02:54 <tarvid>	no
17:02:55 <dasnipa|arpy>	no
17:03:06 <tarvid>	why post it here
17:03:26 <jledbetter>	I like agendas. :)
17:03:44 <tarvid>	i meant why not post it here
17:03:53 <jledbetter>	hm ok
17:04:15 <jledbetter>	Old Business --> Ubuntu hour: Any one done this yet? Interested?
17:04:45 <jledbetter>	Doesn't paste well.
17:04:48 *	dasnipa|arpy googles 'ubuntu hour'
17:05:24 <jledbetter>	Ubuntu Hour is an informal gathering in a public place. Folks come wearing Ubuntu stuff and with laptops. If I understand it correctly, it's to show a public presence and answer questions.
17:05:39 <jledbetter>	Also to geek out. I think jtatum brought it up last time. Care to elaborate, jtatum?
17:06:54 <jtatum>	Thank you, madam chairman. As stated, it is to provide a public presence for Ubuntu. You pick a spot like a coffee shop or bookstore, advertise on mailing lists, and ubuntu it up by using the software and bringing along CDs and any other promotional material you can find. I really wanted to run one but haven't done it yet.
17:07:13 <dasnipa|arpy>	nice
17:07:27 <dasnipa|arpy>	i would totally do one if i lived in a larger city
17:07:56 <jtatum>	i was thinking of driving to the norfolk area for one, although i lived in newport news, for exactly that reason, dasnipa|arpy
17:08:47 <jledbetter>	True, we are a bit spread out.
17:09:03 <tarvid>	We have occasional gatherings in Galax. We have a modest conference room with a projector and a coffee pot. Might get a few more folks with added publicity
17:09:28 <jledbetter>	tarvid, Ubuntu ones? Or general geekness?
17:10:05 <tarvid>	Ubuntu specifically a few times each year. Software Freedom Day once (in September)
17:11:15 -->	dotblank (~eli@pool-71-176-226-7.rcmdva.fios.verizon.net) has joined #ubuntu-us-va
17:11:26 <tarvid>	J Mark Cox does them in Winston-Salem. I drove to one recently and missed the organizer.
17:11:37 <jtatum>	welcome dotblank
17:11:46 <dotblank>	Hello
17:11:52 <tarvid>	welcome
17:12:00 <jledbetter>	That's an idea: checking another local LoCo. I'm close-ish to NC.
17:12:04 <jledbetter>	Hi dotblank :)
17:12:14 <dasnipa|arpy>	yeah it makes me sad how separated we all are distance wise
17:12:27 <jledbetter>	dotblank, We are chatting about Ubuntu hour possibility.
17:12:31 <dotblank>	Are we all scattered throughout va?
17:12:38 <jledbetter>	SE Virginia here.
17:12:46 <dotblank>	central
17:13:00 <dasnipa|arpy>	north/central (not far enough north to be called NoVA)
17:13:39 <tarvid>	10.04.1 is scheduled for release on July 29th. Might be a good reason for a party.
17:14:09 <dasnipa|arpy>	I hadnt heard. why the need for a .1 minor?
17:14:25 <jtatum>	LTS releases get dots throughout their lifecycle
17:14:39 <tarvid>	Policy.
17:14:49 <dasnipa|arpy>	ah ha.
17:14:53 *	dasnipa|arpy headdesks.
17:14:56 <dasnipa|arpy>	I knew that
17:15:29 <jledbetter>	tarvid, And you are offering your area to host it?
17:15:31 <tarvid>	10.04 wasn't that clean and .1s are often better
17:15:37 <tarvid>	Yes
17:15:57 <jledbetter>	Great. What do you need from us, tarvid?
17:16:41 <tarvid>	We are self-sufficient in media. Coffee and donuts are easy to come by.
17:17:18 <tarvid>	We can arrange some crash space and there are nice spots along the creek by my house.
17:17:44 <jledbetter>	I assume you'd move it to the weekend?
17:18:04 <tarvid>	Yes.
17:18:28 <tarvid>	One or two often come in Friday night from North Carolina
17:18:41 <--	maco has quit (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
17:18:44 <jledbetter>	Nice. Ok, writing it down. I'll email to the list and see what kind of interest we get. That's a long drive for me but maybe if I stock up on caffeine... ;)
17:18:52 <tarvid>	We will get a handful of day trippers locally.
17:19:02 <dotblank>	tarvid, where are you located?
17:19:06 <dasnipa|arpy>	mark me down as an unlikely
17:19:25 <tarvid>	Office - Galax, home - Independence
17:19:41 -->	maco (~maco@ubuntu/member/maco) has joined #ubuntu-us-va
17:20:04 <jtatum>	wb maco
17:20:14 <tarvid>	The Galax Fiddler's convention is mid August and attracts 20,000 or so
17:20:50 <dasnipa|arpy>	I didnt know violins were that popular
17:20:59 <tarvid>	Fiddles
17:21:05 <dasnipa|arpy>	I guess down south they have a bigger following
17:21:13 <jledbetter>	Heh
17:21:48 <tarvid>	We're often busy with wireless for the convention
17:21:48 <jledbetter>	Ok, made a note of the tentative date. We can hash it out over email where we can reach more folks.
17:22:28 <dotblank>	Maybe we can get RMLUG in on this as well
17:22:28 <jledbetter>	Next on the agenda: New Business
17:22:44 <jledbetter>	dotblank, RMLUG?
17:23:06 <dotblank>	Richmond-Metro Linux Users Group
17:23:15 <jledbetter>	Good idea.
17:23:26 <dotblank>	They have a fairly active mailing list
17:23:33 <jtatum>	as does TWUUG
17:23:49 <dotblank>	TWUUG?
17:23:50 <tarvid>	http://www.rmlug.org/
17:24:11 <jledbetter>	Tidwater unix user group. They're actually having a weekend meeting so I can finally attend next month.
17:24:28 <jledbetter>	tarvid, Thank you
17:24:34 <maco>	oh look a meeting
17:24:43 <tarvid>	http://www.twuug.org/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page
17:25:34 <jledbetter>	maco, Yep :)
17:25:39 <jtatum>	great :) so everyone should hit up their lugs as well when the gathering time comes :) what's on the agenda for new business?
17:25:54 <jledbetter>	^H^H^H^H
17:26:07 <jledbetter>	New business:
17:26:11 <jtatum>	stty -e <backspace>
17:26:30 <jledbetter>	Quick review of SouthEast LinuxFest
17:27:04 <jledbetter>	Sessions ranging from Non-Technical User level to advanced. Ubucon, DrupalCamp.
17:27:04 <jledbetter>	Summation: http://jeremysands.com/?p=166
17:27:18 <jledbetter>	I think 3 of us were there: maco, jtatum and me. Any one else?
17:28:02 <maco>	i can think of two other virginians, but they use slackware
17:28:03 <jtatum>	the ubuntu table got a ton of traffic. they gave away boxes of lucid cds. 
17:28:18 <maco>	they ran out of lucid cds
17:28:23 <maco>	kubuntu went first
17:28:24 <jledbetter>	Yeah, I did post to the local unix group (TWUUG) and got 2 more people on our mailing list at least.
17:28:48 <jledbetter>	maco, Yeah, when we were sitting there we found one copy.
17:29:26 <maco>	some random folks wandered by "oh wow a LIE-nix conference!"
17:29:37 <jtatum>	was good times, but really the florida team did all the work. the other locos need to get their acts together imo.
17:29:49 <maco>	so we snatched a suse cd and got markdude's fedora cd and found cjohnston to dig up an ubuntu cd
17:30:16 <jtatum>	ah, that's why he needed the cd :) it was one that i brought home from brussels. lol
17:30:27 <jledbetter>	I wondered too. Neat.
17:30:51 <maco>	oh ok well thanks for the cd :)
17:31:00 <jtatum>	hahaha
17:31:34 <dotblank>	I swear I have 20 burned ubuntu cds
17:31:40 <dotblank>	can never find them when I need them
17:31:49 <maco>	markdude and slackware people and i explained linux to them and the lady was really happy to hear she could ditch window
17:32:04 <maco>	i just bought paper sleeves for cds so i can carry burnt discs in purse safely
17:32:41 <maco>	$5.99 at radio shack for 50 of 'em made from supposedly sustainably managed forests
17:32:41 <dotblank>	I'm working on a way my phone can boot up computers with an iso file on an sd card
17:32:55 <dotblank>	uses the usb-gadget modules
17:33:03 <jtatum>	cool idea maco
17:33:15 <jtatum>	wow, slick dotblank
17:34:04 <jledbetter>	Noting those ideas. :)
17:34:04 <dasnipa|arpy>	maco, sounds like jtatum wants some for his purse too
17:34:10 <dasnipa|arpy>	;)
17:34:19 <jtatum>	it was a good meeting. i'm glad we got to go. 
17:34:21 <dasnipa|arpy>	tis a good idea nonetheless
17:34:33 <jledbetter>	Yawp
17:34:48 <jledbetter>	Next LinuxFest folks were talking about is Ohio http://www.ohiolinux.org/ September 10-12, 2010. Anyone going?
17:35:00 <dotblank>	also thinking about making an app that generates a preseed file and  creates a netinstall image and then boots up the computer and auto-magically installs ubuntu
17:35:36 <dasnipa|arpy>	does anyone here ever make it up to shmoocon?
17:35:42 <maco>	o/
17:35:45 <maco>	3 years running
17:35:51 <dasnipa|arpy>	Ive thought about going, but have never managed to make it
17:35:58 <maco>	and i only had to pay once ;-)
17:36:13 <jledbetter>	maco, Nice
17:36:27 <jledbetter>	dasnipa|arpy, No, I haven't. You?
17:36:36 <dasnipa|arpy>	Ive thought about going, but have never managed to make it
17:37:17 <jledbetter>	So many good conferences that it's hard to pick and choose. SELF was great and I recommend it.
17:37:26 <dasnipa|arpy>	yeah...
17:38:11 <dasnipa|arpy>	hackers have a love/hate relationship with ubuntu... many elitists who despise it, but yet the most popular and widely  used pentesting distro is built from it
17:38:54 <jledbetter>	Sounds like we should have a table at it ;)
17:39:51 <dotblank>	The real elitist would make their own pen-testing distro
17:40:04 <dasnipa|arpy>	dotblank, they do.
17:40:12 <dotblank>	I know :)
17:40:23 <dasnipa|arpy>	the biggest ubuntu hater I know of made is own distro called pentoo based off of gentoo
17:40:40 <dasnipa|arpy>	it is the most awkward and difficult thing lol
17:40:47 <dasnipa|arpy>	but hey whatever works for him
17:40:58 <dotblank>	ubuntu can sometimes get under my skin but 90% of the time its ok
17:41:04 <dotblank>	I have arch on my laptop
17:41:22 <dasnipa|arpy>	dotblank, understandable
17:41:43 <jledbetter>	Since we still have a few items on the agenda, I'm going to continue on. :)
17:41:52 <dasnipa|arpy>	jledbetter, ah yes carry on
17:42:02 <dasnipa|arpy>	</tangent>
17:42:21 <jledbetter>	lol
17:42:38 <jledbetter>	LoCo Council Health Check session will be run on the 1st Tuesday of the month in #ubuntu-locoteams from 5-7pm (UTC)/6-8pm (BST)/ 1 pm EDT Meeting was. Minutes available here: http://is.gd/dhHmm
17:42:56 <jledbetter>	Meeting was today, even.
17:43:25 <jledbetter>	To become approved, we need to apply for it. Not sure if we have. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LoCoCouncil/Agenda
17:43:39 <jledbetter>	If someone wants to head up getting us approved, feel free to volunteer now. :)
17:43:57 <dasnipa|arpy>	why do they choose that time I wonder. is the biggest quantity of loco members in euro timezones?
17:44:24 <jledbetter>	She said she'd move it around depending on interest. I attended during my lunch.
17:44:30 <dasnipa|arpy>	what are the current req's for approval jledbetter? as I recall them, we would have difficultly qualifying
17:44:34 <dotblank>	dasnipa|arpy, I found most users are from Europe
17:44:49 <dasnipa|arpy>	though I havent looked at them in a few years
17:45:07 <jledbetter>	dasnipa|arpy, Have events, activity, roadmap and such. If someone makes sure that we document what we're doing, we'd probably do better than no one making sure we keep track.
17:45:47 <dasnipa|arpy>	yeah
17:45:57 <jledbetter>	dasnipa|arpy, Are you volunteering?
17:46:11 <jtatum>	sounds like jledbetter is voluntelling ;)
17:46:44 <dotblank>	lets vote
17:46:55 <dasnipa|arpy>	jledbetter, well I was involved when I lived in Illinois and the illinois loco was renewing their loco
17:47:15 <jledbetter>	dotblank, Sure, you would like to do it too?
17:47:32 <dasnipa|arpy>	what they did was fleshed out their website with their events. and got members to sign a renewal petition
17:47:51 <dotblank>	I don't know enough of ubuntu's organization or preceding
17:48:37 <jledbetter>	There's a how-to off of the Lococouncil's wiki page. We'll help as much as we can. The lococouncil are also very helpful.
17:49:29 <jledbetter>	tarvid, How about you? What say you?
17:49:40 <dotblank>	 Tuesday 20-July-2010, I will be in las vegas
17:49:53 <tarvid>	Specifics sent my way will get attention
17:50:02 <jledbetter>	We don't have to do it this month. Just would like to work toward it :)
17:50:47 <dasnipa|arpy>	jledbetter, agreed
17:51:02 <dasnipa|arpy>	jledbetter, perhaps that should be our goal for this year... or next perhaps
17:51:07 <jledbetter>	Unless anyone else would like to volunteer, I move that dotblank and dasnipa|arpy research/work on this for us :) Feel free to add to next month's agenda or use the mailling list.
17:51:22 <jledbetter>	dasnipa|arpy, Exactly. Just need a roadmap so that we can focus on key items.
17:51:25 <tarvid>	The journey of a thousand miles begins ...
17:51:43 -->	Othor (~Othor@ip68-110-212-207.rn.hr.cox.net) has joined #ubuntu-us-va
17:51:51 <tarvid>	Do we have a destination?
17:51:56 <jledbetter>	Hi Othor :)
17:51:56 <jtatum>	welcome Othor
17:52:08 <dasnipa|arpy>	yeah thats good. I think what I'll do first is use my googlefu to find what the illinois guys did back when I helped out and that should be a good model since they are one of the oldest and decently active
17:52:12 <jledbetter>	tarvid, Destination is Virginia Loco to be approved
17:52:13 <Othor>	hi everyone, sorry i'm late
17:52:39 <jledbetter>	Othor, It's all good. We're on the Loco council check part of the agenda. I'll send out minutes later.
17:52:40 <tarvid>	Why? If we have no events, no actions.
17:52:49 <dotblank>	What are the benefits to an approved loco
17:53:08 <tarvid>	Good question.
17:53:18 <Othor>	jledbetter, ok
17:53:20 <jledbetter>	Approved loco looks like a healthy loco. If we don't have events, we can look into having some. Even if it's a simple ubuntu hour in a coffee shop
17:53:31 <dotblank>	I mean should we focus more on the loco getting more members and events then worry about approval later
17:53:41 <jledbetter>	If 3 of us are going to a convention, we can set up a table to educate peeps about Ubuntu
17:53:58 <tarvid>	There are over 100 members
17:54:00 <jledbetter>	dotblank, True. I guess I like game plans. This seems like a start to one.
17:54:06 <dasnipa|arpy>	dotblank, the other side to that is being an official loco can get us more active members
17:54:21 <dasnipa|arpy>	just due to the higher visibility
17:54:25 <tarvid>	Or is it the other way around
17:54:25 <dasnipa|arpy>	and the more officialness
17:54:33 <dasnipa|arpy>	tarvid, both, actually
17:55:04 <tarvid>	Canonical needs/wants all the evangelism it can get
17:55:06 <dasnipa|arpy>	also, I think you can get sent ubuntu schwag to give out at events
17:55:19 <jledbetter>	Oh, that'd be nice dasnipa|arpy :)
17:55:29 <dotblank>	100 members and 8 people in irc... I think we need to use the mailing list more, I think a lot of people just signed up and are remaining dormant
17:55:57 <tarvid>	that would be a justifiable observation
17:56:11 <jledbetter>	We could have more discussions through it.
17:56:26 <maco>	dasnipa|arpy: yep
17:56:29 <maco>	conference packs
17:56:42 <maco>	get a few shirts, some lanyards, pens, stickers, and fliers
17:56:52 <jledbetter>	maco, That only for approved locos?
17:56:54 <maco>	and of course after each ubuntu release you get a pile of cds
17:56:57 <maco>	jledbetter: right
17:57:11 <jledbetter>	Gotcha.
17:57:13 <maco>	i believe the loco contact has to be the one to request it
17:57:23 <jledbetter>	I think that's tarvid :)
17:57:51 <tarvid>	I am merely the one who poked a stick in the sand
17:58:12 <jledbetter>	And here I come messing up the sand ;)
17:58:24 <tarvid>	Travis Newman is probably the official Grand Poobah
17:58:27 <dotblank>	then I show up and say we need more sand
17:58:33 <tarvid>	He is not here
17:58:39 <jledbetter>	lol
17:58:41 <dasnipa|arpy>	jledbetter, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ChicagoTeam/ReApprovalApplication
17:58:54 <jledbetter>	tarvid, He emailed saying that he's been a bit busy so he turned it to you I think
17:58:55 <dasnipa|arpy>	that is what the illinois loco did for their reapproval app
17:59:18 <tarvid>	If I dig through the archives, there was a fellow willing to mentor
17:59:25 <jledbetter>	Very cool, thank you dasnipa|arpy
17:59:38 <tarvid>	The Canonical Partners can provide swag.
18:00:13 <tarvid>	presensit.com is my closest Partner contact.
18:00:37 <tarvid>	I hold few keys. Maybe only one - the mailing list
18:00:43 <jledbetter>	Ok, noted dasnipa|arpy and dotblank as the ones seeing how we can get approved. Recruit help as you need :)
18:01:29 <jledbetter>	It's 9 so I'll rush through the rest. Two items on the "new business" list were dates. July 10-11 Ubuntu User days and July 12-16 Ubuntu Developer week
18:02:01 <jledbetter>	I'll post links to more information in the email I send out.
18:02:19 <tarvid>	One bene for approved teams is a domain name
18:02:43 <jledbetter>	That'd be nice.
18:02:55 <jtatum>	awesome! what's next :)
18:03:06 <tarvid>	But we need some concrete actions
18:03:19 <jledbetter>	tarvid, dotblank and dasnipa|arpy will start us off with them
18:03:31 <tarvid>	If we want to meet Canonical's aspirations
18:03:34 <jledbetter>	Maybe they can use the mailing list to gather two birds with one hand?
18:04:02 <tarvid>	Any member can user the list.
18:04:13 <jledbetter>	Yes. I spam it lately ;)
18:04:38 <jtatum>	time is running short. let's try to move through the agenda and if we need to setup another meeting for the loco approval process - which sounds like a great idea - we should do that
18:04:40 <jledbetter>	Other stuff on the agenda: 100 Ubuntu Users Project and #locoteams tag.
18:04:46 <jledbetter>	jtatum, yes sir
18:05:01 <jledbetter>	Users project: Based loosely on the 100 Papercuts concept lead by David Siegel of the Design Team, this project aims to introduce Ubuntu to 100 new users in this cycle. Project team members and individuals are encouraged to each introduce Ubuntu to a new person and track that work on the team or personal wiki.
18:05:08 <jledbetter>	For the first three individuals who introduce Ubuntu to 100 new users each, Dinda will send you an Ubuntu t-shirt!
18:05:48 <dotblank>	That should be easy
18:05:57 <jtatum>	holy cow! sounds like a massive task to me :) i am a hermit though
18:05:59 <jledbetter>	dotblank, The race is on ;) I have 1
18:06:06 <dotblank>	I know about 20 people who use ubuntu already just not on a list
18:06:09 <jledbetter>	jtatum, Well, that's why we need to get out...
18:06:30 <jtatum>	i could imagine sitting at a mall like, "hey lemme show you this OS!" 
18:06:34 <jtatum>	heh
18:06:42 <dotblank>	Libraries are good
18:06:46 <jtatum>	really need media to hand out then
18:06:50 <jledbetter>	dotblank, Great idea!
18:07:06 <dotblank>	Also computer shows
18:07:18 <maco>	eh
18:07:21 <tarvid>	That makes sense. Make posters, CDs and volunteer support during specific windows
18:07:29 <maco>	computer people have heard about and formed their own opinions about linux already
18:07:40 <maco>	go for the normal people
18:07:45 <jledbetter>	lol "normal"
18:07:59 <jtatum>	muggles
18:08:05 <dotblank>	I'm more in tuned will school related things but I can probably create a free software club at my college
18:08:10 <tarvid>	You cannot help people who are smarter than you are.
18:08:41 <tarvid>	I did leave Lucid/Wubi on a machine that went out today but I am not sure the poor fellow can get through the boot.
18:10:17 <jledbetter>	dotblank, If we do that, that would probably go towards our approval application :)
18:10:17 <tarvid>	Can virtue be taught?
18:10:22 <dasnipa|arpy>	tarvid, thats not true. someone may be smarter in one area but less experienced in another that you may be an expert
18:10:45 <dasnipa|arpy>	I would argue that nobody is flat out 100% better than another in every single area
18:10:51 <dotblank>	Offer as a community service installations of ubuntu software in computer labs
18:11:05 <dotblank>	I did one at my school while i was in high school
18:11:06 <tarvid>	My tongue is in my cheek and your leg is getting shorter
