== Lastest News : Release of All-sides Testing Report of Ubuntu-7.04 ==

------Release Notice------

Thanks for your attention.

BSQTC( Beijing Software Testing & QA Center ) has released the All-sides Testing Report of Ubuntu-7.04.
Our engineers did the reports by their really hard work. Every issue in the report had been checked by at least
2 engineers and 3 computers to ensure the recurrence. Every description of the issues had been carefully edited
to  make  it  easily  to understand and recur. As a member of Ubuntu community , BSTQC would contribute all the
resource we have.

------How to read the report------

We  put  more  information  in  our  reports  to make it easily for understanding and tracking issues. It's more
accessible then the report of Ubuntu-6.10.

In the report file  "Ubuntu 7.04 Testing Report" there are testing entries one by one which covered user document,
function,  reliability,  usability,  maintenance, portability and Chinese characteristics.  You can see Page-3 of
"Ubuntu 7.04 Testing Report" for details.

In file "Ubuntu 7.04 Testing Report" there are different testing results of "Pass","Pass Partly","n-a","Fail".
"Pass" means the result was obviously correct according to the User Document or experience.
"Pass Partly" means the main function was correct, but the subfunction had issues.
"n-a" means this entry was NOT tested for reasons.
"Fail" means the result was obviously different with the expected result according to User Document or experience.

When  you  found  "Pass Partly" or "Fail" entries in file  "Ubuntu 7.04 Testing Report", you  would  also find some
words  like  "bug: 0010"  or  "bug: 0007,0008,0009".  The  number  is  the  ID  of the bugs we processed in our Bug
Tracking System.  After  you got the  ID number of a bug ,you can find the description in another file "Ubuntu 7.04
defect report" which contains the detailed description of every bug.

For example : when you found the words "bug:0007,0008,0009", it means there are three bugs in this entry. According
to the number 0007,0008,0009,in another file "Ubuntu 7.04 defect report" there are three descriptions entries named
by the  complete tracking ID of "Ubt-7040000007" "Ubt-7040000008" "Ubt-7040000009".  "Ubt-704" is the ID of testing
project, so  you  can search the  "Ubuntu 7.04 defect report" by the key word of "Ubt-7040000007" or just "0000007"
to find the description of the bug-0007.

Every bug has different Severity Level from 1(Fatal) to 5(Suggestion) , in the file we report:

Severity-Level  |  Number of bugs

Severity-1      |  0  

Severity-2      |  30 

Severity-3      |  119

Severity-4      |  235

Severity-5      |  18 

The detail of how we define the level at the part of "Defect Summary" in file "Ubuntu 7.04 defect report".

We  are still considering to improve our report format to make it easily for tracking bugs between "Testing report"
and "Defect report". But  unfortunately we could not report every bug one by one to launchpad because the reason of
resource limitation.

We  did this report based on Install CD of Ubuntu 7.04. Some of the bugs possible have been fixed in updates, please check them carefully.
