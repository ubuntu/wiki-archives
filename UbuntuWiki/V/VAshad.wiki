__TOC__

I am 17 year old from India. Computer has been my companion ever since Warty Warthog was took it's move poor graphics support I had to compile 915 resolution which actually didn't work so had to wait till the release of breezy badger, this was when I found where I belonged to, I know everyone here, even if I never heard of them they are ready to help me. This is where I started working out for community. 

I am a student in a corporate college, Ecil which is few miles away from my adobe. Bug reporting and fixing is a bit old concept to me. Though I am a carafe of Ubuntu, SuSe, gentoo and fedora are my other distros and very rarely Free BSD. 

I play games (mostly host multiplayer games) and programming is still what I am working on. I know C#, Python, HTML/CSS, PERL(especially when reproducing existing viruses);).
