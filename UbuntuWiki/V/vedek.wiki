My Name is Paddy Jones aka Vedek i am from Belfast in the UK

I have been using various flavours of linux from fedora to opensuse to finally ubuntu, i had uptil recently prefered RPM distros to Deb based but i have changed my mind. 

I am learning python and am an active partipate in the support forums at http://www.ubuntuforums.org
