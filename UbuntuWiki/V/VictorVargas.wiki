=== About me ===

I am an Ubuntu user since 4 years (at least my first Ubuntu cd was Hoary Hedgehog) and recently I became proudly part of the Ubuntu BugControl Team, going from several distributions like Redhat, Mandriva, Debian and finally opted for Ubuntu as desktop platform and these last few months I've been trying to migrate the server platform of the company where I work to Ubuntu Server (the entire desktop platform was migrated with very good results). Also I participate actively in my local team (Chile) from approximately 1 year, where I spend much of my time connected to IRC, in response to the mailing lists and sometimes posting on ubuntuforums.

Additionally I have a Degree in Computer Engineering from Universidad Tecnológica de Chile (Copiapó) in 2006 and currently I'm working at a company devoted to technology and the Internet (website monitoring). Today, as a hobby, I'm working on an application called <nowiki>[[https://code.launchpad.net/~kamus/+junk/huuf|HUUF]]</nowiki> that means "help ubuntu users in forums", which allows ubuntuforum users to obtain information from their computers to help them in a better way.

=== Community Participation and Contributions ===

* <nowiki>[[http://foros.ubuntu-cl.org|Ubuntu-cl forums]]</nowiki>
* Bug days / triaging / Global Jams / Juntas Ubunteras / Meetings
* Ubuntu mailing lists, forums.

=== Testimonials ===

''If you can write something about my contributions to ubuntu community, it will be appreciated!''

==== Miguel Ruiz ====

I support this application because Victor is an important part of our community since he became part of it. He learnt quickly the basics of the Ubuntu community and its processes, and his contributions to the BugSquad positioned him as a very good actor of the Ubuntu scene. Talking about our LoCo team, I have to say that Victor always is ready to participate in events, helping users, etc. He is a good fellow too. A big +1 from me.

MiguelRuiz, Ubuntu Chile Council / Ubuntu Member

==== Alvaro Olivares ====

Tuve la suerte de ser la persona que recibió a Victor Vargas dentro de la comunidad ubuntu-cl. Pocas personas han alcanzado tal nivel de compromiso y relevancia en tan poco tiempo. Siempre ha estado dispuesto a integrarse a cualquier labor en la que se le necesita de forma presta y eficiente. 
Especial mención merece la actitud de Victor, realiza cada labor por el gusto de hacerlo y aportar, sin esperar retribución.
Creo que merece con creces ser reconocido como ubuntu member.

AlvaroOlivares, Ubuntu Chile Council.

==== Pedro Villavicencio ====

Victor has been working in the Ubuntu Community for a good time, he's very enthusiastic and dedicated. He's working with the Ubuntu Bugsquad for a while organizing the famous Bug Days and triaging a massive amount of bugs on the desktop front and i must say that he's also doing upstream work, forwarding reports to the upstream bug tracker and also helping to build an strongest relationship with our upstream folks (specially GNOME), participating in their channels and talking with the QA team. He's also giving talks about the Ubuntu project, BugSquad and how to do Triage. I totally support him to be an Ubuntu Member his work is outstanding.

==== Carlos Cuevas ====

I've known Victor for a while and I can say that he is a person committed to the Ubuntu philosophy. He regularly participates in activities of the Chilean Loco and works in every event we organized to promote Ubuntu. At present he is actively involved in the Chilean team and is recognized for their daily work.

CarlosCuevas, Ubuntu Chile Council.
