== What is Ubuntu Kylin ? ==

The objective of the Ubuntu Kylin project is to create a variant of Ubuntu that is more suitable for Chinese users. We are committed to provide you with a delicate, thoughtful and fully customized Chinese user experience out-of-the-box. For instance, by providing a desktop user interface localized in Chinese and installing common software that Chinese users commonly use by default. Ubuntu Kylin has been a formal member of the Ubuntu family, since <nowiki>[[UbuntuKylin | Ubuntu Kylin]]</nowiki> 13.04. This is our fifth release.

== What's new in Ubuntu Kylin 15.04 ==

We are glad to announce the Release of Ubuntu Kylin 15.04 (codename Vivid Vervet). In this release, we have fixed many internationalization and localization bugs in Ubuntu itself and bugs in software written by the Ubuntu Kylin team. All the work that Ubuntu Kylin team do is within the Ubuntu community and ecosystem and as such they are flowed back to Ubuntu itself naturally and everyone using Ubuntu can benefit the result of our work.

=== Changes since 14.10 ===

This release is based on 3.19 linux kernel with the support of Intel Braswell SoC and initial support of Intel Skylake. Transition to systemd is also completed in this release. These applications have been updated to their latest versions: Firefox 37, Thunderbird 31.6, Chromium 41 and LibreOffice 4.4. 

In 15.04, we have turned on LIM (locally-integrated menu) and "click to minimize" on by default. These two new features will make Windows users easier to adapt to the Unity user interface.

We have also released <nowiki>[[http://pinyin.sogou.com/linux/ | Sogou Pinyin]]</nowiki> 1.2 on Feb 2 and a subsequent bug fix update 1.2.0.0048 on April 14. It is not included in the image by default, but you can install it easily from the Ubuntu Kylin Software Center.

We have also integrated exfat-fuse, an exFAT driver for FUSE, so users can use this ubiquitous filesystem on USB sticks.
