Hi guys,
     I'm a part time university student and fulltime linux (ubuntu) user/programmer. Ubuntu is my first Linux distro and so far my learning curve has been great. 

     I currently programme in C, C++, python, Java, Jvascript, PHP, HTML, Zope, SmallTalk and will learn any other programming language that I will find fun and enjoyable. For the time being, I'm taking up the leadership and contactship role for the KenyanTeam. I am also a photo reader.
