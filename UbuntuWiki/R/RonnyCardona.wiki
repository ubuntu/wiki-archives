=== About Me ===
I'm 23 years old, Computer Engineering student and living in Honduras. I like to listen good music like Nirvana, Guns N' Roses, Pearl Jam, Oasis, The Doors, Linkin Park, Cold Play, Epica... etc.

I am Ubuntu user since Hardy Heron LTS, it was my first GNU/Linux distribution. I also tried other distributions like Debian, openSUSE, Arch Linux and Fedora, but finally realized that Ubuntu was my favorite one.
