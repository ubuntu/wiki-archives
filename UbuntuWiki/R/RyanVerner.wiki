Interested in _any_ server-related Ubuntu stuff, from package maint, headless/automated installs, web-based configuration, et al.  Not attending the entire conference due to work committments, but will be in Sydney so am able to come for selected BoF's if needed during the week (in particular, those related to my interests).
