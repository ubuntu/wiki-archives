=== My Intro ===

I've done many different jobs.  I worked in network admin, software development, and web development.  Currently I write PHP as a hobby.  Some freelance stuff, but not much. I'm about to complete my degree in math education at York College and then I'll move into (I hope) a math teacher job.
