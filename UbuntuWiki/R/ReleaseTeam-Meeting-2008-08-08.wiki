=== Mobile Team ===
* nothing new to report; mobile expected to be on-track wrt the freeze

=== MOTU-Release Team ===
* ongoing discussions among MOTU about cruft removal
* process should be improved to notify MOTU about packages demoted from main, so that they can be considered for archive removal entirely if appropriate rather than being "orphaned" in universe
* REVU has been slow this cycle, so the number of new packages for intrepid is expected to be small

=== Ubuntu 8.04.2 schedule ===
* 8.04.1+6 months is right after Christmas, which is awkward
* cjwatson suggests aiming for late January, and to begin preparation around mid-November
* goals expected to be less ambitious than for 8.04.1
** cjwatson will send out a note to remind folks that 8.04.1 was a special case, and not all work should be mirrored to hardy
* settled on Jan 22 as the Ubuntu 8.04.2 release date
