=== About Me ===

Hi, I'm rx007. I live in Tokyo, Japan and I speak English as well as Japanese. I started using Linux in June 2002 with Red Hat Linux 7.3 (Valhalla). That was the first time I dual boot it with Windows XP and was quite happy until version 9 (Shrike). Linux installers are quite hard to find in my area that time, and broadband connection is uncommon if not rare. So I was very excited when I found out that Ubuntu is shipping for free! I signed up, and after several months I received my warty warthog installer and have been using Ubuntu ever since. Also, I can program in php, ruby, java, javascript, and actionscript.

=== Contributions ===

As I just registered in Ubuntu Community so not much to put in here, but would definitely contribute and be very active especially to new users so I can update this in the future. :D

=== Goals ===
* To help make Ubuntu a major desktop operating system.
* To actively participate in the community and support Ubuntu users especially the new ones.
* To do at least one good deed a day.
