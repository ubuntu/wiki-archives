=== Actions Pending ===

* UDS BOF/Post Mortem
** [skaet] Rework release process pages to make explicit who/role, where and when; and apply refactoring (merging pages, checklist, etc. to make timeline not require back/forth linking). - TO DO
** [release team] Need to schedule in advance who's on engineer and management tasks for each milestone in natty.  - IN PROGRESS - see: ReleaseTaskSignup - need Alpha 2, and 10.04.2 signed up.
** [skaet] drive a discussion to resolve disconnect between what we're calling rc vs. a beta 2.  Should we do a beta 2 weeks before, or rc and be strict about it? How many bugs tested post RC? Publish policy statement.  Possibly adjust RC milestone to work around easter for Natty. - IN PROGRESS.  - coordintating meeting at Rally next week.   If interested in participating, and won't be in Dallas - please send email to Kate.
* 2010/11/19
** [skaet/JamieBennett] - discuss where Linaro Natty Freeze milestone should be logged and visible - DONE.  see: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NattyReleaseInterlock
* 2010/12/03
** [allison] - Tutorial on linker order - IN PROGRESS  see: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NattyNarwhal/ToolchainTransition  - comments and updats welcome. 
* 2010/12/10
** [robbiew] get burndown charts into uniform format - DONE.
** [skaet/ScottK] brainstorm with others on ways to help tackling the large number of linking failures backlog - IN PROGRESS
** [skaet] figure out a way of calling attention to wishlist bugs(per: http://www.uk.debian.org/Bugs/Developer#severities), that are actually feature dependencies between teams  (bug:56679, bug: 688142) - IN PROGRESS.  Probably will need to have discussions at next UDS though for resolution. 
* 2010/01/07
** [JamieBennett] test build qt4-x11 with the volatile int fixed before it is landed.

=== Team Updates ===

==== Overview ====

* Alpha 2 tasks, as indicated by the burn down charts are starting indicate progress again from Rally efforts (THANKS!!), but still above projected burn down rate.
* Not much change on the status of current milestoned bugs over rally week, starting to get a bit concerning.   
* End of release milestones are being revisited to ensure effectiveness with easter weekend.  Since our release candidate doesn't fit traditional definition, we're looking at dropping it, and then adding a beta 2 the week before.  Will confirm after proposal submitted to wider audience for feedback/input.  proposal is: Beta 2 on 4/14,  release candidate would not be a formally published set of images and release notes, but rather one of the daily builds selected as a candidate based on testing results.
