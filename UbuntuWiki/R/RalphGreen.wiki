Email: 
  I am a programmer in Dallas, Texas, USA.  I am a member of the board of Directors of my local UNIX and Linux users groups.  I am also active in the local Python and Embedded computer groups.  I try to promote open source software where I can.  I am much more interested in the free, as in speech, aspects than I am in the free, as in beer, part.

 I don't check that email address often.  I can be found in the #dfwpython channel pretty often.  My handle is Severian.
