__TOC__

These are things that needed to be checked for any release (preview, release candidate, and final) by the release team and product manager:

=== Before building candidates ===

* Replace references to code names with references to the formal version number.  See CodeNamesToVersionNumbers for relevant places

* Ensure all pre-release markers are removed from artwork

* Ensure that pre-release markers are removed from ubuntu-docs

* Check the volume labels on ISO's for all architectures (cdimage/debian-cd/CONF.sh, OFFICIAL variable)

* Check CD boot loader help text against menu configuration

* Check the lsb_release output for accuracy

* Check /etc/issue and /etc/issue.net for accuracy

* Check standard /etc/apt/sources.list for accuracy and ensure all suites exist

* Ensure that the "about ubuntu" documents refer to the correct version, if at all

* Prepare release announcement
** Make sure the announcement has links to all derivatives being released

=== Once final image is ready ===

* Request IS refresh images prior to push out to CloudFront
* Push isos to mirror pool and verify that all servers (releases, archive, cdimage) have the images

=== Before announcement ===

* Call round table with stakeholders for a go/no-go survey prior to announce email going out.
* Push links to mirrors and verify
* Check that http://releases.ubuntu.com/ has the proper links and text
* Check torrent functionality

=== Announcement ===

* Email `ubuntu-announce`
* Modify `meta-release` file to notify users of the availability of the new release
* Make sure that the upgrade tool has the proper release notes (or link to them)
* Replace upgrade instructions with simplified version (`update-manager` no longer requires `-d` option)
