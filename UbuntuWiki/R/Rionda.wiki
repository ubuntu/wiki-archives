=== Matteo Riondato ===

Matteo Riondato was born in the foggy northern Italy, about 20 years ago.

After having spent his youth playing with LEGOs and any sort of nerdish games, he discovered computers and have never left them since he was 14. UNIX lover since the very beginning of his computer interest, he is a FreeBSD enthusiast and has focused his interest in system and network security, following the dream of keeping the bad guys out of his playground.

He studies Information Engineering at the Padua University and writes BSD-related articles for the main italian *NIX magazine.

Staff member of the Italian FreeBSD User Group (GUFI), he tries to help the FreeSBIE project as a developer, bugmaster and documentation writer. Since 17th June 2005 he is also a FreeBSD Bugmaster and became a committer on 17th Janurary 2006. Similar to Pulp Fiction's Mister Wolf, he enjoys solving Problem Reports (aka PRs).

He is a member of the Italian Localization Team of the Ubuntu Linux distribution.
