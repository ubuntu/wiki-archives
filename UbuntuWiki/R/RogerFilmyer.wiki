__TOC__

I've used linux for 3 1/2 years, but haven't had a consistent linux box until last year (My main machine is a Mac). I've tried many different flavors of linux, and Ubuntu has consistently been my favorite. My forays into the whole linux community thing have been limited to me just frequenting slashdot, but I intend to do more testing, reporting, helping, etc. You may even see me in #ubuntu!
