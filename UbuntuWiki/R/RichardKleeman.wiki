Email: 
I am a professor of mathematics at NYU with interests in atmospheric and climate science.

I use Ubuntu for my home desktop and laptop and swapped from Fedora because of apt-get
and the attention paid by Ubuntu devs to out of the box performance.

At work I run a personal linux cluster with 24 opteron cpus and RHEL3.
