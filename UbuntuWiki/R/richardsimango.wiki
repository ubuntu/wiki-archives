=== Your Name ===
I am working on a project whose key aim is to develop rural communities of Zimbabwe with ICT. Edubuntu (www.edubuntu.org)and Open ICDL have been identified to be great software and training standard of choice in our project. All information technology centres in Zimbabwe and Africa should choose solutions whose future is cost effective and sustainable for communities they serve. Open Source solutions (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ListOfOpenSourcePrograms) are available for almost every community need.

Edubuntu makes the teaching and learning environment interesting to both the learner and the teacher, at all levels, from primary school to university. Edubuntu provides robust productivity solutions for the work place and  the community users. Educational programs for other proprietary operating systems are not necessarily cheap. Edubuntu makes them available to the user at no cost.
