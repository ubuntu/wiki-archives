__TOC__

I've been using Linux since late 1994, and Ubuntu since around 2005 or 2006, although not exclusively. I started work at Canonical in January of 2014. Before that, I'd been an independent consultant and author, with about 25 books to my name and countless articles, mostly for ''Linux Magazine'' and IBM developerWorks. Within Canonical, I'm a Server and Cloud Cerification Engineer in the Canonical Technical Services team. I'm based in the Lexington office.

I enjoy photography, and in fact I still have an old-style darkroom in my house.

I live in Woonsocket, RI, but I hope to move closer to Boston (and Lexington) soon!
