== Booting Ubuntu/ARM in Qemu ==

These are my notes for my experiments to get Ubuntu/Raring running in Qemu on a precise host.

Download Kernel and Initrd:
<pre>
base="http://ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-ports/dists/precise/main/installer-armel/current/images/linaro-vexpress/netboot/"
wget -c $base/vmlinuz
wget -c $base/initrd.gz
</pre>

Testing that qemu works:

<pre>
qemu-system-arm -kernel vmlinuz -initrd initrd.gz -M vexpress-a9 --append console=ttyAMA0,38400n8 -nographic
</pre>

You can abort the simulation at any time by pressing `C-a x`.
