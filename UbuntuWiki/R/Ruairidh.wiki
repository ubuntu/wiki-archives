Hello Reader,

I am Ruairidh, a 18 year old tech living in the UK. Although I don't intend on making technology my career, I do have a fascination with all things computer. I currently run on an Ubuntu box and have Backtrack 3 (soon to be 4!) on my netbook.

I signed up to Launchpad as I was interested in helping various small projects grow and have recently applied to be part of the Launchpad Documentation Team as I want the initially confusing world of Linux and Open Source to be as accessible as possible!

My hobbies include running, playing guitar, drinking a lot of coffee, reading, and spending time with various important people in my life. I also work as a Support Engineer in a local computer shop.

You may find my Launchpad account here: https://launchpad.net/~ruairidh

I am also the managing director of TeenxPats. Hopefully we'll be an Ubuntu server soon!

This page will probably update sooner or later and have some more interesting information.
