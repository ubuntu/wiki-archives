The Ubuntu Reviewers Team consists of a group of people who review patches that are attached to bug reports.  We have some amazing contributors contributing patches to problems that they face.  The Ubuntu Reviewers Team work to get these patches reported upstream and thus "give back" to the community.

The Ubuntu Reviewers Team get the patch, test it, and report it on the upstream bug tracker if the patch is successful.  If a patch does not work as expected, the submitter is encouraged to submit a working patch to fix outstanding issues.  In case the submitter does not respond, the reviewer makes the modification giving credit to the submitter.

If a patch is critical enough, like a security issue or a major blocker, we work to getting it immediately into Ubuntu and forward upstream.  This may also qualify for an SRU to previous versions of Ubuntu.
