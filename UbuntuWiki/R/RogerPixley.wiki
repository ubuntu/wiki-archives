TODO:

* Explain GIS more fluently

* Make sure that the Desktop concept is not misunderstood

* Give solid examples of similar projects and datasets that can be leveraged

* Use cases must be more explicit and Simpler to read.

* Really Explain the Back End GIS section so that can be a no brainer to implement
