__TOC__

A new user to Ubuntu, a some what long time user of Linux. Can't believe how far Ubuntu has come! After a night with installing the system, decided to join in on spreading the word.

1) finally got WNN and Kinput2 to work. ハッピー！

VoIP and Ubuntu
--------------------------------------------------

Just finished a major install of Asterisk 1.2.7.1 on Ubuntu. Works GREAT!
I have to say, Ubuntu SHOULD be the preferred platform for Asterisk.

Dec 29 2006

Finished updating to Asterisk 1.4.0 and I have to say Ubuntu REALLY should be the
preferred platform. Works really smooth. The New GTALK <--> Asterisk feature is
great.
