==== Secure Boot ====
Kubuntu should now be able to support <nowiki>[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface#Secure_boot|UEFI Secure Boot]]</nowiki>, a standard for controlling what software can be run on a computer.  Supporting Secure Boot, a part of the Windows 8 certification requirements for client systems, ensures that Ubuntu will continue to provide an "it just works" experience on new hardware.

If you have hardware for this,  we would appreciate your help in testing it out.
