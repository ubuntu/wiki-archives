__TOC__

We are proposing to remove all arts associated packages from the archive prior to the release of Kubuntu 9.04. aRts is no longer maintained upstream, there are no applications in KDE4 that use the arts sound system and we no longer provide a KDE3 desktop.

Consequently a number of packages that depend on arts will need to be rebuilt. 

=== Guidelines ===
In most cases this will involve:
 1. download the source package
 2. Run dch -i to create a new changelog entry and record your changes
 3. edit debian/control to remove libarts-dev. Search for any other occurrences of arts and edit accordingly. It is also worth checking the .install files for anything obviously arts related and save yourself a rebuild
 4. testbuild package in a chroot/pbuilder
 5. Make any further fixes to get the package to build.
 6. Note your changes in debian/changelog
 7. create a debdiff. 'debdiff old_version.dsc new_version.dsc >new.debdiff'

If you do fix a package please mark <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/arts/+bug/320915|LP: #320915]]</nowiki> in debian/changelog so it can be linked to the bug report

Fixes:
<pre>
checking for mcopidl... not found
configure: error: The important program mcopidl was not found!
Please check whether you installed aRts correctly or use
--without-arts to compile without aRts support (this will remove functionality).
</pre>
