== Problem: too few loopback devices ==

=== Intro ===

I'm trying to serve up serve up the contents from several ISO images and have run out of loopback devices.

=== Solution ===

Create more loopback devices

<pre>
for i in {1..300} ; do
  dev=/dev/loop${i}
  [ -e ${dev} ] && continue
  sudo mknod ${dev} b 7 ${i}
  sudo chmod --reference=/dev/loop0 ${dev}
  sudo chown --reference=/dev/loop0 ${dev}
done 
</pre>

Mount the images

<pre>
ls ubuntu-*.iso |
while read iso ; do
  loop=${iso%.iso}.loop
  sudo mount -o ro,loop ${iso} ${loop}
done
</pre>
