=== About Me ===

Roman Yepishev lives in Kiev, Ukraine and is a huge Ubuntu fan.

{{https://launchpadlibrarian.net/104365238/face21-192.jpg}} 

He installed my first Linux distribution in 2003, switched several of them - Mandrake, Redhat, Slackware. Then in 2006 he found himself in need of a server distribution that required much less time to install, configure and maintain than Slackware. He picked Ubuntu.

=== Contributions ===

During the first years I spent very little time participating in Ubuntu life even though I depended on Ubuntu for my job. In 2009 I switched to actively participate in bug reporting and testing and the first merge proposal was made for ubuntuone-client's missing icons.

In 2010 I started working for Canonical on Ubuntu One project officially as "Support Engineer" handling multiple tasks, such as various helper applications (most of these are in <nowiki>[[https://people.canonical.com/~roman.yepishev/us | ubuntuone-scripts]]</nowiki>), <nowiki>[[UbuntuOne-Indicator|indicator-ubuntuone]]</nowiki> and other internal services.

I advocated the use of Trash folder for Ubuntu One synchronization service to delete files to instead of unlinking and provided the initial code.

I spent most part of 12.04 release period testing the packages on all my machines, that resulted in <nowiki>[[http://g.ua/ChBX|quite a few bug reports]]</nowiki> in various packages ranging from OpenStack components to Unity.

=== Ongoing activities ===
* Testing IPv6 connectivity in applications included in Ubuntu since I am running a full IPv6 network at home.
* Ubuntu One support duties and testing.
* Testing OpenStack on my home Ubuntu 12.04-based server.

=== Future goals ===
* Help Ubuntu One become a better service.
* Dive into short movie making using only the tools available for Ubuntu to see how a user would feel (<nowiki>[[https://code.launchpad.net/~rye/openshot/stringify-none/+merge/110771|+first OpenShot MP]]</nowiki>).
