=== Meeting Logistics ===

* No meetings, day after milestone release.  (ie. no meeting on 12/2 ;) )   
** Team summaries should still be mailed to ubuntu-release on Thurs or Friday (Thank you to those who did!)
** If urgent items, ad hoc meeting will be called on Monday. 

* Meeting format: 
** overview of new format: https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-release/2011-November/000471.html 
** for this to work,  its going to be important that the team statuses should be on ubuntu-release mail list at least 4 hours before the meeting (ideally the night before the meeting, so folks have time to read and digest and think up questions).
** when its your turn in the Q&A session,  please paste the link to your email status in the channel,  and use ".." to signal you've finished with questions/comments.
** when someone has a question,  please 'o/' to make sure we pause.
