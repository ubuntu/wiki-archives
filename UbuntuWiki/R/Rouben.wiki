Gretings! You've reached my very own Ubuntu wiki page.

What can I say about myself? I live in Toronto, Canada. I am in my mid-to-late twenties, I work full-time as a system administrator for the Univeristy of Toronto. I enjoy using Ubuntu very much, and I use it exclusively at work as my primary desktop. We also have Ubuntu running on some production, testing and development servers, and even an iBook G4 Mac laptop!

I am currently on the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-backports-testers|Ubuntu BackPorts Testing Team]]</nowiki>, SupportTeam, BugSquad and MarketingTeam.

If you need to reach me, check out my <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/people/rouben|launchpad page]]</nowiki>.
