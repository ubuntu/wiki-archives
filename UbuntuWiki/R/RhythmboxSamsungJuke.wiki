== Howto use Rhythmbox with the Samsung Juke Cellphone Linux ==
Howto use '''Rhythmbox''' (and other jukebox software) with the '''Samsung Juke''' (and other mp3 players) in '''Ubuntu Linux'''.

=== Configuring HAL's .is_audio_player ===

* Plug in your Juke with the usb cable, duh

* Create a file called '''.is_audio_player''' in the root of your Juke <code>touch /media/YOUR_SAMSUNG_JUKE/.is_audio_player</code>

* Now edit the file to include this information 
<pre>
audio_folders=Music/
folder_depth=99
output_formats=audio/x-ms-wma,audio/mpeg,audio/aac,audio/mp4 
</pre>

* Restart Rythmbox and you should see your mp3 player and music appear under '''Devices'''.  ''Note: You should have already installed '''RestrictedFormats''' or you won't be able to load your mp3s.''

=== Syncing ===

* Although '''syncing isn't supported''' it's easy enough to '''drag and drop''' your music from your mp3 player to Rythmbox to copy it.

* You can also create a '''playlist''' from selected songs in Rythmbox and easily drag'n'drop them to your mp3 player.

* Syncropated http://syncropated.garage.maemo.org/ may be a good solution as well.
