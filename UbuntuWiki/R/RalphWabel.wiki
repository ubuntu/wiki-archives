** I've started using <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntulinux.org/|Ubuntu]]</nowiki> Warty from the time it came out in October. In the beginning I was switching from time to time back to Windows. Sooner or later I got comfortable with it and it became my primary OS.

* I'm active on the <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org|Ubuntu Forums]]</nowiki> since November 2004.

* I'm writing more or less frequently about Ubuntu and Linux stuff on my <nowiki>[[http://ralph-wabel.net|blog]]</nowiki>.
 
* Later on, I've joined the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/|ubuntu wiki]]</nowiki>. I'm writing and adding howto's and guides on <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UserDocumentation|Ubuntu User Documentaion]]</nowiki>.
