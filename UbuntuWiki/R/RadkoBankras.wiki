=== Plans ===
I expect my new laptop (Dell Latitude E6410) to arrive in one or two weeks. After the unwrapping ceremony, I will format the drive and install the AMD64 variant of Ubuntu Desktop 10.04 LTS. My plan is to report my findings to the Laptop Testing Project and will take the challenge to get every single inch of the laptop working in Ubuntu.
