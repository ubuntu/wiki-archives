=== Hey! ===

I am from the Philippines, and I work as a UI designer and a user experience know-it-all. Let me know how I can help!

Outside the Ubuntusphere, I also do web development. I am a founder of the startup <nowiki>[[http://sinefunc.com|Sinefunc]]</nowiki>, which focuses on Ruby web development and regularly contributes to the open source Ruby community.
