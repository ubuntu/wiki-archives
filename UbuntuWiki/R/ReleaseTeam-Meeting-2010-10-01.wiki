=== Team Updates ===

Thanks to Riddell for putting a nice set of RC candidate images together.  :)

Release notes for open issues, has still a fair amount of last minute chaos associated with it (part of it necessary).  Will be prototyping some ideas to see if we can get the chaos down a bit for the next cycle.  On a tactical note, please flag to ubuntu-release-notes project those bugs that you feel important to be documented in maverick's release notes.
