===== Authentication =====
Authentication will be provided by an OpenID login through Launchpad. From here the application will check to see if the person logging on is an administrator of a LoCo Team. If they are an administrator or get added to the application by their LoCo Team administrator, then login will be successful and they will have access to the "Manage" pages. If they do not qualify for the previous, then they will remain in a guest status and will only be allowed to view.
