=== Karmic and the end of my Sound Card Life ===

I'm done... I finally decided to send my CA0160 sound card to the trash bin... if Jaunty caused it to lose most of its functionality, Karmic (namely, last ALSA & Pulseaudio releases) put it off the way: sound is noisy, stuttered and, then, unusable...

No more to say, I'll look for a new sound card. Ideas?
