__TOC__

My name is Rusmanto Maryanto or Rusmanto bin Maryanto. Maryanto is my father's name. 
I was born in 1963 at Sragen, Central Java, Indonesia. I have been using Linux since 1998. I started with Slackware and RedHat (1998-2000), then Mandrake or Mandriva (2000-2004), BlankOn http://blankonlinux.or.id (2004-2005), and Ubuntu (2005-now). I am currently employed as editor in chief of InfoLINUX magazine (http://infolinux.web.id) and as director of Nurulfikri Computer (http://nurulfikri.com). I was co-writer and technical editor of Edubuntu's book that published by Dian Rakyat (http://www.dianrakyat.co.id) and some Indonesian books about Linux.
