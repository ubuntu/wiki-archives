__TOC__

The readahead lists need to be updated at regular points in the release process to ensure that they closely match a likely installed system.

The recommended points are:

* Before Beta
* Before ReleaseCandidate
* Before Final Release

This way each test candidate gives the same speed impression as the final release.

=== Procedure ===

# Download appropriate daily Ubuntu Desktop CD image
# Install in a vmware instance (single CPU, 256MB RAM)
# Boot installed image with "profile" kernel command-line option.
# Copy /etc/readahead/boot out and replace the debian/boot.list file in the readahead-list source package with it.
# Sed out any file with the kernel version number in it.
# Upload with suitable changelog entry.
