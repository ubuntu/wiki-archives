Email: 
Living in the wilds of Sacramento, CA. A Ubuntu user since July 2005. I'm interested in forming a Sacramento Ubuntu user group, so if you're interested, drop me a note.

I first installed Kubuntu on a Compaq Presario 2200US laptop in July of 2005. After a year of using it without a single problem, I bit the bullet in July of '06 and installed it on a Toshiba Satellite laptop as well. So far, so good.

'''What I have on my systems'''

OpenOffice.org
Abiword
KOffice
The GIMP
Digikam
KATE
QuantaPlus
And a ton of other apps and utilities, but the ones above are the main ones I use.

Quanta Plus is the reason I finally moved completely away from Windows. I was waiting for my then-favorite HTML editor to be potred to Linux, but when I found out it wasn't going to happen, that was the deciding factor. It was hard turning my back on a program I've used for 10 years, but Quanta Plus does everything the old one did and then some.

I use Digikam to manage my digital photo collections, and the GIMP to edit them.

My next step: adding an external USB hard drive for additional photo storage.
