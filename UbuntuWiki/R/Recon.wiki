Hi. I'm Alan Lander, better known as Recon. I usually hang out in the freenode IRC channels. My usual channels are, but not limited to, 

{*} #defocus

{*} #ubuntu

{*} #ubuntu-offtopic

{*} ##club-ubuntu

{*} #freenode

I also participate in the NJ LoCo in the summers, or when I'm not busy. Or both. (I have school the rest of the time.)
