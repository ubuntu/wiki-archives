I have been using Linux since 1996 I started with Redhat and then Slackware until I found Ubuntu. I am currently employeed as a System Admin for a large web hosting company based in California.<<BR>>

I spend my spare time working on ubuntuforums.org and learning more about debian packages. :)<<BR>>

I also hope to join the DOC team for Ubuntu and contribute what I can.
