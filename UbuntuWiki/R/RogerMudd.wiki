__TOC__

My name is actually Dave and I live in Orlando. By day I work in marketing for a large commercial real estate firm. By night I recover from sitting in front of a computer all day by - err - sitting in front of a computer all night.
I have a background in journalism and design and am an avid photographer. I love reading and I can't stand the beach (I'm betraying my northern roots).
I've been experimenting with Linux since 2000, never really sticking with it and inevitably falling back on Windows. That changed early last year with my introduction to Ubuntu. Love the community and ethos revolving around Ubuntu and I'm looking forward to collaborating with a group of like-minded people.
