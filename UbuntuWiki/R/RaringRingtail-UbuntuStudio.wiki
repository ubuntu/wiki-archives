** http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntustudio/releases/13.04/release (UbuntuStudio) 

=== System Requirements ===

The minimum memory requirement for Ubuntu Studio 13.04 is 768 MB of memory.  It is highly recommended that you have 2GB or more memory though so that the system will perform much better.  More information about other recommended hardware on the new Ubuntu Studio website when it is released.

== Upgrading ==
=== Upgrading from Ubuntu Studio 12.10 ===

'''NOTE: ALTHOUGH THE UPGRADE FROM UBUNTU STUDIO 12.10 TO 13.04 DOES WORK, IT WILL INTRODUCE SOME ISSUES. HENCEFORTH, THE UBUNTU STUDIO TEAM IS RECOMMENDING A FRESH INSTALL RATHER THAN AN UPGRADE TO INSTALL 13.04.'''

To upgrade from Ubuntu Studio 12.10, press Alt+F2 and type in "update-manager" (without the quotes) into the command box. Software Updater should open up. Click "Settings" and click on the tab "Updates". Set "Notify me of a new Ubuntu version" to "For any new version". Close and relaunch Software Updater and the Software Updater should display the following message: "New distribution release '13.04' is available. Click Upgrade and follow the on-screen instructions". Please click on "Upgrade" and follow the instructions given.

=== Upgrading from Other Releases ===

Users of other Ubuntu Studio releases need to upgrade first to 12.04, and then to 12.10, and then basically upgrade to 13.04.
