=== Testimonials ===

If you know me and have something nice to say, please leave a comment here. 

Robie is the kind of guy who takes every situation with a cool, calm and collected approach. When I was new to Ubuntu development, he was the guy who offered to give me a hand. When a problem arises, he is the one to not think about how to fix the problem, but also what can be done to find a better solution moving forward. He is the person who reaches out to you if you need help. He is the kind of guy that Ubuntu needs, who uses his responsibilities to help others, and for what he has done to help me I really am grateful for that. -- <nowiki>[[LaunchpadHome:itzswirlz]]</nowiki>
