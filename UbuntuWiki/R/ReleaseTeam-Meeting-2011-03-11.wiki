** Beta: http://people.canonical.com/~platform/workitems/natty/all-ubuntu-11.04-beta-1.html

=== Actions Pending ===

* UDS BOF/Post Mortem
** [skaet] Rework release process pages to make explicit who/role, where and when; and apply refactoring (merging pages, checklist, etc. to make timeline not require back/forth linking). - IN PROGRESS. 
* 2010/12/10
** [skaet/ScottK] brainstorm with others on ways to help tackling the large number of linking failures backlog - IN PROGRESS
** [skaet] figure out a way of calling attention to wishlist bugs(per: http://www.uk.debian.org/Bugs/Developer#severities), that are actually feature dependencies between teams  (bug:56679, bug: 688142) - IN PROGRESS.  Probably will need to have discussions at next UDS though for resolution. 
* 2011/02/18
** [release team]  to revisit release freeze date, and its relation to beta 2 - IN PROGRESS

** Status:  (from apw email, edited a bit to make wiki friendly...)

** <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelTeam/ReleaseStatus/Natty | overall status for kernel team ]]</nowiki>
** <nowiki>[[http://people.canonical.com/~platform/workitems/natty/canonical-kernel-team-ubuntu-11.04-beta-1.html|burndown for the beta 1 milestone ]]</nowiki>
** <nowiki>[[http://people.canonical.com/~platform/workitems/natty/canonical-kernel-team.svg| burndown for the cycle]]</nowiki>

All of our alpha-3 items are now retargetted appropriatley.  We again have very few specific work items in the ubuntu-11.04-beta milestone.  The natty kernel is now at v2.6.38-6.34 (v2.6.38-rc7 based); though currently we do not have any powerpc builds due to a compiler bug.  Mainline progress towards a final release are continuing satisfactorily, with us expecting a v2.6.38 final in the next week.  The main concern currently is the vesafb interaction with the intel DRM drivers which is triggering GPU hang reports, a prototype for which is in testing.

Of the bugs called out on the agenda against the kernel, status is as below:
** #344878 ecryptfs long filename prototype continues to evolve with a second push going to upstream, the on-disk format is not yet agreed and this is highly unlikely to be resolved in time;
** #539467 SATA alpm is now disabled in userspace, possible fix suggested by upstreream available for testing;
** #542660 still present, further upstream testing requested;
** #625364 looks possible to work around using a pm-utils quirk;
** #630748 remains waiting on Intel for updated wireless firmware;
** #634487 investigations just beginning;
** #636091 is looking like a locking issue in USB, possible fix in testing;
** #702090 looks to be an interaction with vesafb, upstream are saying "don't do that", prototype fix in testing;
** #712075 partial fix in place, little progress; and
** #717114 possible revert needs testing against mainline.
