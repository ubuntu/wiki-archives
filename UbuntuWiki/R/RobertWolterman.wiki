== About Me ==
I'm 23 and a recent graduate from Iowa State University with a major in Aerospace Engineering. I'm currently looking for a job in Computational Fluid Dynamics or Aerodynamics. I'm married and I have a dog, both of which I enjoy coming home to each day from my temporary job doing MS Access Database programming and system support. 

My current homepage is <nowiki>[[http://robert.wolterman.googlepages.com|here]]</nowiki>, yes it is a Google page, but I'm waiting on getting personal webspace until after I find a career. The site isn't fully completed since I keep thinking of other stuff that gets in the way.

== Programming Languages ==
* Fortran 90 & 77
* Python (with GTK+)
* C++
* Bash Scripting
* Java

== Interests ==
* Aerodynamics & Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)
* Wind Engineering
* 3D Visualization of PMARC-12 output (Currently using <nowiki>[[http://www.tecplot.com/|TecPlot]]</nowiki>)
* Solving problems with computers
* Aviation

== Codes ==
* <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+spec/autokernel/|AutoKernel]]</nowiki>
** Going to be an automatic kernel compiler
* <nowiki>[[http://robert.wolterman.googlepages.com/foilgen|Airfoil Generator]]</nowiki>
** Written in Python and GTK+ from Glade <nowiki>[[http://robert.wolterman.googlepages.com/rwairfoil_gui2.png|***Preview***]]</nowiki>
** Will include NACA 4 & 5 Series airfoils, Biconvex airfoils, and the airfoil series I've developed
* Modifications to <nowiki>[[http://kde-apps.org/content/show.php?content=28637|PyWireless]]</nowiki>
** I have modified <nowiki>[[http://kde-apps.org/content/show.php?content=28637|PyWireless.py]]</nowiki> found on kde-apps.org to include the wireless card's IP address. I used the IP address code from wifi-radar. I also fixed a bug, in my version that will fix signal strength over 100%
* I've used <nowiki>[[http://kde-apps.org/content/show.php?content=28637|PyWireless.py]]</nowiki> as a basis for a CPU temperature monitor and an ACPI monitor that currently shows CPU temperature and battery charge percent. These can be found on my website.
