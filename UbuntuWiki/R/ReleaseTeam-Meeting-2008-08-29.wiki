=== Agenda ===
* Milestoned bugs
** https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/intrepid/+bugs?field.milestone%3Alist=1323
* Milestoned features
** https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+milestone/intrepid-alpha-5
* General feature update
* Known regressions
** status of issues found in previous milestone: http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/intrepid/alpha4#Caveats
* Hardware testing
** consequences of kernel 2.6.27 upload?
* ISO size
* Future issues expected to impact the release (e.g. major upstream changes pending)
** This will be the first meeting following Feature Freeze, so is a good time to address any important specs that are still in progress and need to be considered for freeze exceptions (hopefully, none!)

=== Milestoned bugs ===
* <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/intrepid/+bugs?field.milestone%3Alist=1323|Release-critical bugs milestoned for alpha-5]]</nowiki>
** <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/250506|250506]]</nowiki> in consolekit assigned to pitti
** <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/254042|254042]]</nowiki> assigned to cjwatson, no concerns about completing it on time for alpha-5
* <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/intrepid/+bugs|List of all bugs targeted to intrepid]]</nowiki>
** <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/247376|247376]]</nowiki> depends on fglrx updated for the new Xorg ABI; not targeted to alpha-5

=== Mobile Team ===
* daily images now being built from the mid seed
* installer work pending for mobile; ubiquity changes to land before alpha-5
* linux-lpia still based on Linux 2.6.26; will be investigating 2.6.27 as a solution for hanging apt-get update, after alpha-5
* several new source packages currently in NEW or REVU
** authority delegated by motu-release to lool and ogra for freeze exceptions as needed
* decisions pending on choice of default media player, mail client, and IM client

=== Desktop Team ===
* <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/245383|245383]]</nowiki> GTK+ screen flicker issue assigned to seb128
* <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/252174|252174]]</nowiki> gvfsd-trash crasher tentatively targeted to alpha-5
* elisa 0.5 update planned before alpha-5
* lool to upload new upstream version of cheese

=== Kubuntu ===
* KDE 4.1.1 is released this week and will be landing Monday before alpha-5.
** Knetworkmanager doesn't currently work with network-manager; Riddell looking into it
** Kubuntu ISOs currently have plenty of room to grow, so the new upstream release should not be a concern for sizing

=== Server Team ===
* fix for <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/261847|261847]]</nowiki> in openjdk-6 needed, pulling in dbus/avahi into server installs; requires input from doko on proper resolution, milestoned for alpha-6
* <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/262264|262264]]</nowiki> regression in likewise-open, incompatible with the new PAM framework; suggested that Jerry talk to slangasek
* landscape-client almost done with security review and ready for inclusion

=== Kernel Team ===
* Call for testing of Linux 2.6.27 sent out
* Kernel team is tracking known upstream regressions in 2.6.27 <nowiki>[[http://bugzilla.kernel.org/showdependencytree.cgi?id=11167&hide_resolved=1]]</nowiki>
* Regressions reported against Linux 2.6.27 by Ubuntu users are also tracked: <nowiki>[[https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bugs?field.tag=regression-2.6.27]]</nowiki>
** fglrx, nvidia are tracked as regressions by the team, but are not considered blockers for 2.6.27 in intrepid
* A <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelTeam/2.6.27-kernel-plan|fallback plan]]</nowiki> is in place in the event 2.6.27 is not ok for intrepid
* pgraner and heno_ have a call later to discuss hardware certification against 2.6.27

=== Foundations Team ===
* freeze exceptions requested or pending
** new pulseaudio to match new alsa and new kernel
** experimental python 3 packages (not by default, maybe not really FFe)
** system-cleaner
** usb-installer-images
** dvd-performance-hacks
** timezone map changes for ubiquity
** openoffice.org 3 (again, not by default, parallel-installable)
** xorg-options-editor needs promotion to main I think
* fglrx is on the watch list, but is entirely in upstream's hands right now

=== QA Team ===
* <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/DailySmoke|Smoke testing]]</nowiki> has revealed a problem with OEM mode on Kubuntu: <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/251634|251634]]</nowiki>, targeted for intrepid.
* Concerns raised about the impact of Linux 2.6.27 on SRUs in intrepid.

=== MOTU Release Team ===
* motu-release has appropriate manpower or handling the intrepid freeze
* ongoing discussion about the last-minute FeatureFreeze upload rush
* FFe process for universe is mostly the same as for hardy
** decisions about various package groups are again delegated to domain experts
** bugfix-only new upstream releases will again be allowed for universe

=== ISO size ===
* stable and good

=== Action Items ===
* slangasek to investigate <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/255635|255635]]</nowiki>
* slangasek to follow up with bryce on <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/197680|197680]]</nowiki>
* mdz to file a new bug report about gnome-power-manager crashes and escalate to slangasek
* heno_ to report back on hardware certification status of 2.6.27    
* cjwatson to follow up with bryce regarding xorg-options-editor MIRs
