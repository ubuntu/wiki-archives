=== The problem ===
 Described in <nowiki>[[X-Troubleshooting-IntelPerformance]]</nowiki>, some laptops with intel graphics hardware
experience a serious performance degration after upgrading from intrepid to jaunty. The reasons
for that are already explained on that page. This page explains how to revert the driver to the
version in intrepid.

=== Installing the package ===

Add the following lines to your `/etc/apt/sources.list`:

<pre>
 deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/siretart/ppa/ubuntu jaunty main
 deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/siretart/ppa/ubuntu jaunty main
</pre>

Import the appropriate GPG key (port 11371 on your firewall must be open to use the keyserver):

<pre>
 sudo apt-key adv --recv-keys --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com 0xce90d8983e731f79
</pre>

See <nowiki>[[https://help.launchpad.net/Packaging/PPA#Adding%20a%20PPA%20to%20your%20Ubuntu%20repositories]]</nowiki>
for additional information how to add GPG keys to your system.

Install the driver:

<pre>
 $ sudo apt-get update
 $ sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-intel-2.4
</pre>

Now you ''should'' be set. Restart X by running "sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart" in a terminal and see if the graphics performance from intrepid is restored.

Do I need to change my xorg.conf file? ==> May not work. Situation not improved without xorg.conf change??

=== Rolling back ===

If the driver does not work for you, or is not better, you should rollback to
the original Ubuntu one. Remove the two lines from `/etc/apt/sources.list`
again, and install the original one again:

<pre>
 $ sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-intel
</pre>

If X.org does not start at all, you should change to a text terminal by
pressing Ctrl+Alt+F2, logging in, and use "sudo nano" to edit
`/etc/apt/sources.list`. After installing `xserver-xorg-video-intel`, restart
the computer with "sudo reboot".

=== Results ===

If you have tested the package, please report your findings (broken|same|better) and also your PCI ID:

<pre>
  lspci -nn | grep VGA
</pre>

Still a little slow on full-screen refreshes (min/maximizing windows), but this driver is a godsend for this chipset, which is awfully laggy and has no DRI in Jaunty's default 2.6 driver.

| Still poor performance: glxgears shows "Failed to initialize GEM.  Falling back to classic.". The performance is better than default Jaunty settings and it's comparable to Jaunty+UXA or Intrepid+EXA, that is 3-4 times slower than Hardy or Intrepid+XAA. Compiz works (default Jaunty lags, Jaunty+UXA works well on Compiz). Extreme Tux Racer displays 0.5 to 1.8 FPS, compared to 5-7 In Jaunty+EXA+MigrationHeuristic "greedy" and to 9 to 24 of Jaunty+UXA. 2D redraw lag is noticeable, maybe worse than Jaunty+UXA.

| bad bad bad. yes, there are some gliches in the new driver, and the flash video full-screen modes (as in YouTube) aren't great, but it's MUCH BETTER than the older driver.. using the X3100 in Dell Inspiron 1525

| Unable to verify
| Anthony Durity
| When I reverted to the 2.4 driver I found myself facing the situation where my Dell 19" monitor could not display a thing because of incorrect timing settings. This was the case with this machine prior to Jaunty and also occured to me with another Dell box and a 22" monitor and a different Intel card whose PCI ID I do not know so either I'm very unlucky or there's something going on with Dell's digital flat panels and Intel's 2.4 driver. Normally multiple reboots would mysteriously get the two to talk to each other but it was maybe 1 time in 5. Completely random. The latest driver fixed this for me (I was overjoyed) but then I started getting window border artifacts so I thought maybe I'd revert and try my luck. I'll stick with a driver that allows me to boot 100% of the time I reckon.

| Improved from ~205 fps to ~420 fps - still below the ~550 fps I had on Intrepid, but a significant improvement. Oddly enough, however, full-screen flash video seems to have a lower performance than with Jaunty default (2:2.6.3-0ubuntu9)

| I don't use any 3D/Compiz stuff. 2D performance is much better with driver 2.4 now: I can drag windows around without artefacts, firefox scrolls faster, firefox tabbar scrolls way faster. Thanks! But: In comparison to jaunty's intel driver, fps from glxgears (I know it's not a benchmark) drop to about half the amount - anyway that's not relevant for me.

| Without this, my system used to freeze several times a day as described in <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/375358|Bug #375358]]</nowiki>. However, now I can't play 3D games like OpenArena (the screen is very small in the beginning and then it turns black) and KDE transparency effects stopped working. '''Does not improve performance either'''.

Dual head monitor with compiz works fine, though if in dual monitor mode the screen resolution isn't equal to both monitor the one with bigger resolution gets no refresh on the size difference at the desktop level, applications refresh ok in the same area.
