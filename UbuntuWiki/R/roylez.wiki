=== About Me ===

My first experience with Ubuntu was in 2005 when having trouble running a computer simulation under Windows. I translated the source code to Linux platform and installed Ubuntu on the server, and everything just goes so sweet. Everything worked as expected, software installation was a breeze, and most importantly, configuration was simple and clear for mortals. Since then, I could not move my eyes from this great distribution, and my life has changed.

Currently I am working as software engineer in Shanghai, China. The nature of the job has nothing to do with my previous education, but more related to *nix. Thanks to Ubuntu, I am very happy with my job.
