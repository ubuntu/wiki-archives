=== Roadmap ===
* '''OBJECTIVE''': Improve information available about Karmic
* '''SUCCESS CRITERIA''': Create at least two(2) different resources for the top five problems. So for instance lets say Wireless is one of those issues. A team member then updates a current wiki page and then ports that to the Forums. That would be two sources.
* '''ACTIONS''': 
** Start at Google and search for a likely problem a user will face.Find and document the top 5 problems a user will face.
** Determine what is new/different in Karmic that might require new/updated materials 
** First start by Updating any Forum How-tos, Wiki pages that can be updated. 
** If the Success Criteria is still not accomplished create appropriate Forum or Wiki Pages.
** Issue One: 
** Issue Two: 
** Issue Three: 
** Issue Four: 
** Issue Five:

=== Building Your Roadmap ===

Each goal in the roadmap has a set structure which you should stick to. This is how it works:

* '''Objective'''' - An Objective is a goal that you want to achieve. Summarize your objective here in one sentence (e.g. 'Exhibit Ubuntu at OSCON' and 'Create Lucid Marketing Materials').
* '''Success Criteria''' - This is a statement that can be clearly read to determine success on the above 'Objective'. This needs to be as clear as possible and not vague: it will indicate if you achieved the 'Objective' (e.g. 'A successful exhibition at OSCON' and 'Lucid website buttons, banner ads and wallpaper provided for LoCo Teams').
* '''Actions''' - This is a set of steps that need to be executed to achieve the 'Objective'. It is recommended that if someone volunteers to commit to delivering on an action, you put it in brackets (e.g. 'Print out LoCo logo on a banner (Jono Bacon)'). There can be multiple actions for each Objective. 
* '''Blueprint (optional)''' - It is recommended to use a launchpad blueprint for your objective.  Launchpad isn't just for developers, but is also great for community tasks.
* '''Driver (optional)''' - If someone is coordinating this objective and helping those involved to deliver on their actions, list that person here.  If you're using a blueprint it's especially convenient to mark the driver as the Drafter and Assignee of the launchpad blueprint.

==== Tracking Progress ====

Here are some tips on tracking progress on your roadmap:

* Review it at meetings - your roadmap should be an agenda item at every meeting your team has. Review progress, identify problems, ensure everyone is clear on what they are doing and unblock blockers.
* Review mid-cycle - it could be useful to review progress on the roadmap halfway through the cycle in detail.
* Evaluate at the end of a cycle - when the cycle is complete, review the roadmap and see how much the team achieved.
