== Introduction ==
I'm a 28 year old software engineer who hails from St. Charles, Missouri, USA. I'm happily married and have a son who is the center of my existence. I got my first start with Linux some time ago, with a Red Hat distro that I actually bought at a store cause I didn't have the patience or bandwidth to download it (lol). As my patience and bandwidth increased, I experimented with SuSe, Xandros, Knoppix, and some other distros that shall remain nameless, all the while dual-booting to make sure that I could always go back to Windows. With the release of Vista, and all the press surrounding it, I decided to make the leap to Linux for good, and for that leap I chose Ubuntu. I am loving every minute of it and have never looked back.

I can usually be found in the #ubuntu-missouri, #ubuntu, or #ubuntuforums-beginners channels.

== Personal Goals ==
My personal goals are to educate people about not only the economic gain from using free software, but also help them to realize the FREEDOM that they can have by using it.  FREEDOM is about having a choice what you do with your computer.  It's about being able to use your computer the way YOU want.  There's so much power put into your hands when you use free software, and I just try to help people see that.<<BR>>

Also, I want to educate people on how to USE Linux.  People that I have talked to have said that Linux is "too hard" to use, when really what they are saying is that they don't understand '''HOW''' to use it.  If they would spend a couple hours with it, toying around and seeing what it's all about, they'll soon find out that it's not that bad. 

== Projects ==
Right now there are a couple of <nowiki>[[MissouriTeam-Projects|projects]]</nowiki> that the Missouri Team is working on.  My role in the team is of the Marketing Research Lead.  I look for new ways to promote Ubuntu and the Ubuntu Missouri LoCo team.  If you have any suggestions as to how to do this, find me on IRC or e-mail me at the above address.<<BR>>
