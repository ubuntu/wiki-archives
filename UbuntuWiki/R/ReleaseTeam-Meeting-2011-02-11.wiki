=== Actions Pending ===

* UDS BOF/Post Mortem
** [skaet] Rework release process pages to make explicit who/role, where and when; and apply refactoring (merging pages, checklist, etc. to make timeline not require back/forth linking). - TO DO
* 2010/12/10
** [skaet/ScottK] brainstorm with others on ways to help tackling the large number of linking failures backlog - IN PROGRESS
** [skaet] figure out a way of calling attention to wishlist bugs(per: http://www.uk.debian.org/Bugs/Developer#severities), that are actually feature dependencies between teams  (bug:56679, bug: 688142) - IN PROGRESS.  Probably will need to have discussions at next UDS though for resolution.

== IRC Meeting Log ==
* mootbot logs available at 
** http://www.novarata.net/mootbot/ubuntu-meeting.log.20110211_1000.html
** http://www.novarata.net/mootbot/ubuntu-meeting.20110211_1000.html

== Highlights ==

* Overall: Teams are starting into the A3 feature groove, bug backlog is still a bit high in some teams.
* QA: Linux, LibreOffice, and Unity are toping the list of incoming bugs over last week.
* HW Cert: All servers for 11.04 except 1 are now reporting results,  desktop runs not done this week due to hardware relocation.
** Bugs under focus: Bug:714829, Bug:695842, Bug:715871
* Security: Making progress on work items for Natty, nothing A3 critical
** Bugs under focus: bug:344878, bug:712662 (pending doko input), bug:714908, bug:714958, bug:715874.
* Kernel: uploaded two kernels with the latest v2.6.38-3.30 (v2.6.38-rc4 based) with lots of fixes for graphics,  now mostly watching mainline
** Bugs under focus: see list in agenda, and Kernel team report.
* Foundations: btrfs installs now confirmed to work properly again, Upstart visualisation and interactive boot work
** Bugs under focus: made progress this week, switching back to features for A3
* Server: working on awstrial, new openstack snapshot, working on LXC on openstack, and new packages including Handbreak plugin for mysql. Eucalyptus still remains to be a problem in Natty.
** Bugs under focus: regression showing up with bug:590201, will provide feedback on above list post meeting.
* Desktop: cleanup of A3 WI's in progress, annoying compiz bug about invisible windows should be fixed now, python-gobject ABI breakage has been hotfixed, so pygtk apps are running normally again
** Bugs under focus: Bug:638827 is blocked on mozilla.
* UbuntuOne: shotwell not looking likely for Natty, unity integration has started, and banshee still needs some work.
* Kubuntu: kubuntu mobile mostly working again, libindicate-qt updated for new API, Qt being built with gcc 4.4 to work around issues with gcc 4.5 on ARM  

* Thorny areas that need some focus and/or decisions:
** plymouth timing interactions with vesab (kernel, foundations)
** Eucalyptus (server)
** X - rolling back, or working around? (desktop, arm, kernel)
** python 2.6/2.7 vs. 2.7 only? (motu, foundations)
** picking up Linaro recent toolchain drop? (arm, foundations, linaro, kubuntu)

== ACTIONS ==
* [release team]  to revisit release freeze date, and its relation to beta 2
* [zul] to provide update on status of server bugs highlighted in agenda
* [wendar] to post resolution on the Python 2.6/2.7 vs Python 2.7 inclusion in Natty
* [skaet] follow up with doko after he returns on Linaro toolchain inclusion.
