__TOC__

Polypaudio was rejected both for Breezy and Dapper because of stability issues and lack of maintainership. This seems like it might change. There has recently been a major release, and Pierre Ossman is being payed by <nowiki>[[http://www.cendio.com/|Cendio AB]]</nowiki> to work on Polypaudio.
