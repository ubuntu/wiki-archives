=== About Rob ===
----

I am based in Torquay, Devon in the UK.  I am a semi-active is a member of the Devon & Cornwall GNU/Linux User Group at http://www.dcglug.org.uk

My main day job involves working for a large UK media company providing IT and broadcasting support to the South West region.  Mainly this involves fixing Windows PCs but I am trying to help introduce FLOSS into the company one way or another.

My Ubuntu usage is mainly at home where I use Ubuntu 6.10 Beta on my main desktop PC.  I also run an internal company wiki/fax server on an old Dell box running Ubuntu Server 6.06.
