== About ==
I live just outside of Zurich, Switzerland and work as a copy editor for the news service of an international relations think tank at a local university.

I've been using Ubuntu/Kubuntu since the end of 2006. I am in no way an expert, but I've learned just enough about the distro through trial and error to be a danger to myself.

'''Launchpad''': https://launchpad.net/people/rashunda

'''IRC'''(freenode): rashunda

'''Email''': rashunda [at] gmail [dot] com

'''Website''': http://www.rashundatramble.com

== Involvement ==

I've been involved with the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SwissTeam|Swiss Team]]</nowiki> for a couple of weeks. On 8 March, you can find me at the Ubuntu booth at the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SwissTeam/OpenExpo2007|OpenExpo]]</nowiki> in Bern.

== Philosophy ==

I believe in the idea of FOSS. Technology is the ultimate gap bridger. Money - or lack of it - should not be a hindrance.
