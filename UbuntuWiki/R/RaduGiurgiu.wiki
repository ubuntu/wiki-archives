== Initiation ==
'''I am interested in Linux since 2010''', when I started to study at the institute INS Torre Vicens in Lleida. Since this center used Linux as Operating System, of which I was completely unaware, or knew of its existence. But every time I became more interested in Linux, and prepared to install it at home. I downloaded the image of Ubuntu 10.04, and finishing the installation could not connect to wifi, so I searched the Internet how to fix this, and then to solve the problem, '''I realized people who are behind all this and they are willing to help without anything in exchange.''' Since that day I devote myself to helping people in forums on issues related to Linux. :D
