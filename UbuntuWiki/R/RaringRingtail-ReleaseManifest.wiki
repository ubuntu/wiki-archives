== Release Manifest is Obsolete ==

The Release Manifest is obsolete, as of Raring Ringtail.  Going forward, the intersection of "release product", "supported/unsupported" and "ready to ship" will be entirely handled by the <nowiki>[[http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/|ISO Tracker]]</nowiki> and the CD Image publishing scripts.
