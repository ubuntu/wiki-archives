== Restyling of Nautilus ==

Nautilus should be more immediate, and above all more orderly. In the following are some ideas're looking to reorder Nautilus.

In the picture below, are circled the changements that can make Nautilus better:

==== Idea #1: Files and folder reorganization ====

Often people don't found their files because they are mixed and sorted by name, so complicated view immediately the searched file. A better organization can be the solution: sorting files by general type (images, videos, folders, documents and others) and then by name we can exclude the tipes of file that don't interest us. An organization as in the picture is perfect to obtain the goal. To order even more items in the folders you can give the user the option to hide the types of items in folders. For example, clicking on the word "Documents" in the figure, Nautilus automatically hides all files that belong to that category.

You can also put in brackets the number of objects in a category.

Here are the types of files in each group:

* Folders (all folders)
* Documents (.doc, .docx, .pdf, .odf, .txt, ......)
* Images (.png, .gif, .jpeg, .jpg, .xcf, .psd, .ps, .raw, ......)
* Music (.mp3, .mp2, .midi, .mid, .aac, .wav, ......)
* Video (.avi, .m4v, .mp4, .mov, .mjpeg, ......)
* Other files (all other file types)

==== Idea #2: Reorganization of the side menu ====

Items in the side menu should be organized better, in Ubuntu now we have devices mixed with folders and with share folders. A re-ordering of the side menu is required. It should be also given the user the option to hide items in each category. The organization should be as in the picture.

==== Idea #3: Restyling of the location bar ====

The location bar should be as in the Ubuntu Software Center.

==== Idea #4: Add a search bar ====

Would be added a search bar in place of the search icon.

==== Idea #5: Size of the icons ====

Scalable icons should be used and should be possible for the user to scale the icons in a progressive manner with a controller as in the picture.

==== Idea #6 (not in the picture): Icons to change the folder view ====

Instead of a drop-down menu should be made of the icons that make it faster and more intuitive to change the view of objects in folders.
