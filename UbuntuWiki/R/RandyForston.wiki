No real info added yet.

I'm a System Admin, working in Unix (HP-UX), Linux (UBUNTU!!, Red Hat, SuSe), and Windows.

I live and work in the SF Bay Area, San Jose, (Silicon Valley), to be precise.

I want to start a localTeam. More on that as it happens .....

Hoary, by the way, is Great! Faster and better than Warty.
