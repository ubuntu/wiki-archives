=== About Me ===

sjnims from the Ubuntu forums.

I am a non-IT professional/student in New York. I spend my weekends with my friends and family, checking out our favorite local band or heading up to my family's cottage for some rest and relaxation.

The Ubuntu Community has and still is the number one source for all my linux/ubuntu related questions.
