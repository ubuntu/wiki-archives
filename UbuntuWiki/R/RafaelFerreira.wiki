__TOC__

I'm an Ubuntu user from Salvador-Brazil. I Like to share a bit of what i know about computing with everyone through my blog (http://rafaelgeek.blogspot.com) or presential encounters. I'm able to make/organize events if necessary to help the growth of ubuntu community. I'm a member of Brazilian LoCoTeam,translations contributor and member of Planeta GNU/Linux Brasil.
