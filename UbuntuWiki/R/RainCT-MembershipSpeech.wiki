__TOC__

Hey, I'm Siegfried Gevatter (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RainCT, https://launchpad.net/~rainct), a 16 years old from Catalonia (I lived 9 years in Germany, though).

I started actively using Ubuntu by the time Dapper was about to be released. In December 2006 I joined the Catalan mailing list, and I've been an active member of the LoCo Team since then. I started getting involved with packaging and a bit bug triaging some months ago (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RainCT/Contributions), and I maintain some packages in Debian. Some weeks before Gutsy was released I also started contributing to the Catalan Ubuntu Translators team (I haven't done much there yet, but I did many translations in direct contact with upstream before; https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RainCT/Translations).
