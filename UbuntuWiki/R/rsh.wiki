Hello and willKommen.

Installed this ubuntu 8.04. Right now its driving me crazy. so many things u need to learn that you never did in Windows. Hope I would get rid of typing commands. 

Anybody ever tried to play with bluetooth devices? It plays with you. They show you up some of the times, the next time it won't. Bluez gives you more blues...BT bluez.  But i m loving other features especially so many packages to choose from. Satisfied that i won't have to worry about viruses  =:)#

I wrote about the bluetooth blues on answers launchpad and the result........... it is still open. One guy had similar prob. Seeing solved by side i opened and found that he just clicked on solved. Why? He says who wastes time with such things :(. And those who have Lucid Lynks don't care about bluez, they upgrade to Blueman.
