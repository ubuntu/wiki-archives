About Me
I am a senior in Computer Engineering at Iowa State University. I am going to be spending the next 8 months at an internship and would like to use my spare time to contribute to Ubuntu and refine my programing skills. 

My interests are pretty wide spread at the moment but hopefully as I get more involved I will figure out what I want to work on. 

Time Zone - UTC-6:00

Right now I have a lot of spare time but starting May 9th I will be available ~ 11:00-18:00 (UTC)
