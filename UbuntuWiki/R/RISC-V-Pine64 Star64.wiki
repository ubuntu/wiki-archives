__TOC__

These are bring-up notes for running Ubuntu on the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/STAR64|Pine64 STAR64]]</nowiki>.

This is all unofficial and not currently supported by Canonical. YMMV when doing this.

=== Necessary hardware ===

You will need at least the following hardware:

1. A Star64 board (of course)
2. A MicroSD card with at least 16 GiB of space. (I have not achieved success trying to use eMMC to boot Ubuntu.)
3. A UART debugging cable.
4. A power supply capable of powering the Star64

=== Ubuntu 25.04 (Plucky Puffin) ===

Currently I have only managed to run this on Ubuntu 25.04 (Plucky Puffin). However, I managed to boot it as follows:

1. Get a <nowiki>[[https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-server/daily-preinstalled/current/|Preinstalled image]]</nowiki> for the Milk-V Mars. (The device tree will be slightly wrong, but it's close enough to do an initial boot.)
2. Write that image to the SD card.
3. Set the Star64 to SD boot mode (DIP 1 up, 2 down on the v1.0 prototype - check which version you have)
4. Plug the debugging cable into the Star64 (see the <nowiki>[[https://wiki.pine64.org/images/1/1b/Star64-map-connectors.svg|Connectors map]]</nowiki> for specific pins).
5. Power on the device

Then, change the contents of <code>/etc/flash-kernel/machine</code> to be `Pine64 Star64`

Finally, run <code>sudo dpkg-reconfigure flash-kernel</code>

After this, reboot and you should get a working version of Ubuntu Plucky with the correct device tree.

==== What works ====

After going through this process, the following items work:

* Basic RISC-V
* Wired network

==== What doesn't work ====

The following items don't work currently:

* USB ports (See: https://bugs.launchpad.net/star64-ubuntu/+bug/2092968)
* HDMI output (neither the HDMI driver nor the GPU are supported)
* Booting from eMMC

==== What's untested ====

* PCIe support

==== Additional work ====

There is a community project underway to get Ubuntu running on the Star64, at https://launchpad.net/star64-ubuntu

This project has a PPA that has some useful additional packages at https://launchpad.net/~lengau/+archive/ubuntu/jh7110

This includes:

* A firmware package with blobs for the JH7110
* A Linux kernel that enables (amongst other things) the HDMI driver.
