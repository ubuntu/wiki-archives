__TOC__

I am epimeteo at ubuntuforums.org, freenode and ptnet IRC servers.

I have a homepage in Portuguese language that I have created in March 2006 to help Portuguese people to install Ubuntu in their computers: http://ubuntu.no.sapo.pt

I am an active member of the Ubuntu Portuguese Translators Team too.

I am an IT working on my own account at the moment.
