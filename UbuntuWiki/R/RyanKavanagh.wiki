== Ubuntu Stuff ==
=== My contributions ===

* Answer questions here and there on the forums as well as in #kubuntu / #ubuntu
* Answer <nowiki>[[https://answers.launchpad.net/~ryanakca/+tickets|support requests]]</nowiki>
* Organised the IdeaPool (It's now in alphabetical order, to my great awe).<<FootNote(  IdeaPool: From what I've been told, the idea pool is looked at relatively frequently. Most things in canonical are either what Canonical Mark wants and can pay for or what volunteers are willing to do. However, the saying "talk is cheap" can also be applied to adding something to a wiki. If suggestions aren't backed up with action, it is unlikely that they will be implemented. If someone has a really good idea that canonical would love or if someone willing to implement something sees something great there, it might be implemented. (http://www.ubuntu.com/developers/bounties references IdeaPool))>>
* Helped found the Ubuntu Classroom along with hybrid.  -> <nowiki>[[Classroom]]</nowiki> 
* Designed Kubuntu Edgy's <nowiki>[[http://www.kubuntu.org/images/kubuntu-edgy-rc.png|RC Release Image.]]</nowiki>
* Spread the word about Kubuntu and Linux in general through out my school and family, installed Kubuntu for those who wanted to try it out, and check in every now and then to see if they were having any trouble.
* Ran the NUN meeting in #ubuntu-meeting on January 7th 2007
* Wrote a HOWTO on getting GPG to work with KMail
* Packaging/merging/syncing, see tables below (As you can tell, I'm working towards MOTU)
* Added support for Debian schroots to mk-sbuild-lv (ubuntu-dev-tools) and wrote the missing manpages for ubuntu-dev-tools

=== Current work ===
* Kubuntu Webmaster
* Port Matthew East's ubuntunew help.ubuntu.com/community/ theme to wiki.kubuntu.org
* Merges
* Keep all this balanced with my school work.

=== The Future ===
* Continue to spread the word about Kubuntu
* Become more proficient in packaging
* Get proficient enough in python to do a bit of programming for Kubuntu (System Settings maybe?)
* Look into writing some more documentation (See if it's something that I find interesting)

=== Bettering Kubuntu and Ubuntu ===
We could improve kubuntu bug triaging by having ubugtu paste new kubuntu bugs in #kubuntu-devel, #kubuntu-testing, or #kubuntu-bugs. That way people would see kubuntu bugs as they come in, instead of having to search for them on launchpad. It might help to re-add 
http://launchpad.net/~kubuntu-team/+packagebugs to the topic in #kubuntu-devel. It would also be an interesting idea to have a Kubuntu-QA team, that takes care of triaging kubuntu bugs, and bugs in KDE apps. They would have the same permissions on LP as Ubuntu-QA. I would love a glossy, polished kubuntu with as little bugs as possible, so that we might fix Ubuntu bug #1.
