== Installation ==

<pre>
$ apt-get install roundup
</pre>
== Overview ==
Installation created a '''/var/lib/roundup/trackers/''' directory whre you are going to install all your '''roundup''' instances.

== Install a first tracker: "yourtracker" ==
Now, we are going to install an example tracker named '''yourtracker'''
<pre>
$ roundup-admin install
</pre>
When prompted:
* Enter tracker home: '''/var/lib/roundup/trackers/yourtracker'''
* Select template [classic]: (just press ''Enter'')
* Select backend [anydbm]: '''sqlite'''
'''/var/lib/roundup/trackers/yourtracker/config.ini''' has been created during this process.
== Configure "yourtracker" ==

Edit '''/var/lib/roundup/trackers/yourtracker/config.ini''': Pay a special attention at '''tracker''' and '''mail''' sections.
=== "tracker" section ===
* web: http://hostname:8088/yourtracker/
(!) Roudup uses email notifications. This '''web''' variable will be the URL mentionned in emails. This should be correct.
=== "mail" section ===
* domain: put the domain name of your server
* host: put the hostname of the SMTP server you'll use

== Initialise "yourtracker" from configuration ==
<pre>
$ roundup-admin initialise
</pre>
* Enter tracker home: '''/var/lib/roundup/trackers/yourtracker'''
* Admin Password: *****
* Confirm: *****

== Make the system see it ==
When system boots up, you may wish the roundup '''init.d''' script to launch "yourtracker".

Edit '''/etc/roundup/roundup-server.ini'''
<pre>
[main]
port = 8088
hostname = localhost
user = roundup
pidfile = /var/run/roundup/server.pid
logfile = /var/log/roundup/roundup.log

[trackers]
yourtracker = /var/lib/roundup/trackers/yourtracker
</pre>

=== Make the database read and writable ===
<pre>
chmod -R 777 /var/lib/roundup/trackers/yourtracker/db
</pre>

== Test it ==
Just go to http://hostname:8088/yourtracker/ with a browser.
== In case of trouble ==
If you get the '''An error occurred. Please check the server log for more infomation.''' message, Check '''/var/log/roundup/roundup.log'''

When I first setup my roundup instance, I left '''roundup-admin''' as '''admin-email'''. This adress did not exists, so that when roundup tried to send an email for the first launch, the SMTP connection failed. Roundup raises errors when SMTP transactions fail.
