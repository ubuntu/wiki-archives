__TOC__


Very few packages are exluded from the patch review initiative. Mostly because teams or maintainers who work on those packages follow a different process.

If you want a package you're interested off the list, you can either simply 

* branch <nowiki>[[https://code.launchpad.net/ubuntu-review-overview||our patch review tools]]</nowiki> and propose a change in there
* or file a bug report on the <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-review-overview/+filebug|patch review tools]]</nowiki>

In Launchpad you can view the <nowiki>[[http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-reviewers/ubuntu-review-overview/trunk/annotate/head:/data.py|current list of packages that are excluded]]</nowiki>.
