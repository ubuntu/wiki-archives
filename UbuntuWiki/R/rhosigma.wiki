=== Testimonials ===
From [TravisNewman]- (For the record, I am a moderator on the Ubuntu Forums, co-lead on the Virginia LoCo Team, and an Ubuntu Member) rhosigma, as a regional representative for the VA LoCo, has been instrumental in getting the Virginia LoCo team back up and running after a long hiatus. Among many other things he has designed our logo and has shown skill with wiki editing. He is motivated to help and spread Ubuntu to the community, and I think he would be a great candidate for membership.
