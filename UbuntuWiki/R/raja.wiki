==== Bhavani Shankar ====

Having known Raju personally, All I can say that is he is a helpful nice guy and having a look around in forums I think he has shown that. A dedicated hardworking man and I endorse his application:) good luck Raju :)
==== Joel Leclerc ====
Raja was the best guy I've ever had working on a project. He has helped me so much with organizing and working with the project, and without him, most of the project I'm working on now would either not exist, or would be horrible. I know he is fully worthy of becoming an Ubuntu Member. So +1! :)

==== Michael Parks ====
Raja has been a great help in all the projects I have worked with him on, and has shown much help in the Ubuntu Forums.  I fully support his application to become an Ubuntu Member.  +1!  -ubudog

Raja is really active in forums and he is eager to help the testing team. He installed 12.04 in his machine to test when I was tracking the issues and learning about Oneiric. He is real awesome guy and I vouch for him for the Ubuntu Membership - <nowiki>[[Mohan_chml|Mohi]]</nowiki>
