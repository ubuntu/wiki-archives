Hi,

I am an avid though a less known user of '''Ubuntu''' from ''India'' - and am currently on hoary-devel (and will shift to the hoary release as soon as i get the cds - my connection was ''downgraded'' from 128kbps to 2kbps (seriously), so i cant keep up with the daily changes offered by devel)..

I intend to make my presence felt in the community and hence am creating this page.

My skillset is limited. Programming experience is C++ and Java only.

Got hooked on Ubuntu - then started using fedora - then slackware - but now i am back on ubuntu - I'm loving it (tm)..

I am thinking of helping in translation to my mother-tongue - ''Hindi''. 

BTW, some people ''might'' recognize me as '''da_bon_bon''' on #ubuntu and #kubuntu .. anyone ? (Please, it is my last ditch effort to make everyone aware of my ''existance'' ;) )

Rohan Dhruva.
