__TOC__

We would like to apply for a package set for package relating to the Ubuntu One suite of services, with the following initial packages in the set:

* desktopcouch
* dirspec
* libubuntuone
* rhythmbox-ubuntuone (renamed from rhythmbox-ubuntuone-music-store)
* ubuntu-sso-client
* ubuntuone-client
* ubuntuone-client-gnome
* ubuntuone-control-panel
* ubuntuone-couch
* ubuntuone-dev-tools
* ubuntuone-file-storage-api
* ubuntuone-installer
* ubuntuone-storage-protocol

There is currently one per-package uploader (RodneyDawes) who has upload access to a couple of the packages, and who has had many sponsored uploads for nearly all of them. Another uploader (NataliaBidart) is also currently applying for per-package upload access to several of these packages. Both of these uploaders should be the ones to have initial upload access for this package set.
