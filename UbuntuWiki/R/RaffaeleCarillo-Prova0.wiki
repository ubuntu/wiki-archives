=== Solution #1: Make all applications (not just those in the picture) with the style of the Ubuntu Software Center ===

The title and the image explains everything.

==== Possible problems: ====
Maybe some icons are hard to make with the style of the Ubuntu Software Center.

=== Solution #2: Make all applications with  the style of Nautilus and Firefox ===

The title and the image explains everything.
