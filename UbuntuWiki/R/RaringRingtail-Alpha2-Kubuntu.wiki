We’re preparing  Kubuntu 13.04, the Raring Ringtail, for distribution in April 2013. With this early Alpha pre-release, you can see what we are trying out in preparation for our next version. We have some interesting things happening, so read on for highlights and information.

Kubuntu Pre-releases are NOT recommended for:

* Anyone who needs a stable system
* Anyone uncomfortable running a possibly frequently broken system
* Anyone in a production environment with data or workflows that need to be reliable

Kubuntu Pre-releases ARE recommended for:
* Regular users who want to help us test by finding, reporting, and/or fixing bugs
* Kubuntu developers

== Getting Kubuntu 13.04 Alpha 2 ==

=== Download a Disk Image ===
* <nowiki>[[http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/releases/raring/alpha-2/|Bootable images for standard PCs/laptops/netbooks]]</nowiki>

Instructions for burning the image to a DVD or USB flash drive can be found on the <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BurningIsoHowto|Burning ISO Howto]]</nowiki>.

We recommend you learn how to <nowiki>[[https://wiki.kubuntu.org/HowToMD5SUM|check your image file]]</nowiki> so your pre-release is as it’s supposed to be. Compare your MD5 checksum with the correct ones found <nowiki>[[http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/releases/raring/alpha-1/MD5SUMS|alongside the images]]</nowiki>.

== Alpha 2 Highlights ==

=== Software Updates ===
==== KDE Plasma and Applications 4.10 ====

<nowiki>[[http://www.kde.org/announcements/4.10/|{{http://www.kde.org/announcements/4.10/screenshots/plasma-4.10.png}}]]</nowiki>

<nowiki>[[http://www.kde.org/announcements/4.10|The latest release of KDE's Plasma Workspaces and Applications 4.10 ]]</nowiki> adds a new screen locker, Qt Quick notifications, colour correction in Gwenview and faster indexing in the semantic desktop.  

=== Infrastructure ===
==== Secure Boot ====
Kubuntu should now be able to support <nowiki>[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface#Secure_boot|UEFI Secure Boot]]</nowiki>, a standard for controlling what software can be run on a computer.  Supporting Secure Boot, a part of the Windows 8 certification requirements for client systems, ensures that Ubuntu will continue to provide an "it just works" experience on new hardware.

If you have hardware for this,  we would appreciate your help in testing it out.
