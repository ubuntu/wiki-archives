** [releaseteam & other managers ] Review master Natty cycle multiple releases schedule (NattyReleaseInterlock) and update as needed. - DONE
** [skaet] drive a discussion to resolve disconnect between what we're calling rc vs. a beta 2.  Should we do a beta 2 weeks before, or rc and be strict about it? How many bugs tested post RC? Publish policy statement.  Possibly adjust RC milestone to work around easter for Natty. - IN PROGRESS 
* 2010/11/19
** [skaet] communication about o-series/p-series in launchpad, opening in December - DONE

== IRC Meeting Log ==
* mootbot logs available at 
** http://www.novarata.net/mootbot/ubuntu-meeting.log.20101210_1000.html
** http://www.novarata.net/mootbot/ubuntu-meeting.20101210_1000.html

== Highlights ==

* overall, reasonable progress on work items for alpha 2, but expecting it to start to slow for holidays soon.
* python 2.7 transition progressing fairly well. Summary of what's left can be found: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bugs?field.tag=python27
* new kernel (2.6.37-rc5) will permit re-enabling NX support for modules, and re-enabling a number of drivers that were disabled for the rebase.
* natty upstart spec finalized, improvements planned are: debug stanza, override files, job visualisation, socket activation, D-Bus activation, chroot support, user sessions and visible job start/stop in plymouth details view.
* OO.o builds are breaking CD images (due to python 2.7 transition and problems with python-uno) looking at options to work around.
* desktopcouch 1.0 should release today,  initial zeitgeist integration to be released next week
* gcc/arm issues resolved,  builds are progressing again for ARM team and Kubuntu.
* unity foundations work mostly done, but will hold off on upload until January, to avoid dependency conflicts until python stabilizes.
* still considerable backlog on the linker side in MOTU, that needs some help

== ACTIONS ==
* [robbiew] get burndown charts into uniform format
* [skaet/ScottK] brainstorm with others on ways to help tackling the large number of linking failures backlog
* [skaet] figure out a way of calling attention to wishlist bugs(per: http://www.uk.debian.org/Bugs/Developer#severities), that are actually feature dependencies between teams  (bug:56679, bug: 688142)
* [dbarth] update on open bugs from agenda
