=== About Me ===

'''Ubuntu Distribution:''' Ubuntu 8.04

I am a Junior College student in Singapore, and am an extremely avid Ubuntu and Open Source user.  I have been using Linux, starting from RH 9 to FC8 and switched to Ubuntu since Hardy beta. I am currently trying to give something back to the Ubuntu community. Currently, I am helping out in triaging bugs (especially firefox bugs).
