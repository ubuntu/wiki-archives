WORK IN PROGRESS!

I use Ubuntu on a lot of different PCs. I have decided to post my notes and other information about getting Ubuntu to run on various PCs, that way anybody else with the same PC can get Ubuntu up and running easily.

==== Here Is A List Of My Systems: ====

===== Gateway Solo 9300 Pro (Laptop) =====
Specs:
* CPU: 497.518 MHz Intel Pentium III (Coppermine)
* RAM: 288 MB SDRAM, PC133
* Hard Drive: 60 GB HITACHI_DK23FA-60
* CD/DVD Drive: TORiSAN DVD-ROM DRD-U624 DVD-Rom
* IDE Interface: Intel Corporation 82371AB/EB/MB PIIX4 IDE (rev 01)
* Video Card: ATI Technologies Inc Rage Mobility P/M AGP 2x (rev 64)
* Sound Card: ESS Technology ES1978 Maestro 2E (rev 10)
* Ethernet Cards: Belkin F5D5020 (PCMCIA Wired), Belkin F5D7010 (PCMCIA 802.11g Wireless)
* USB Controller: Intel Corporation 82371AB/EB/MB PIIX4 USB (rev 01)
* Input Devices: AT Translated Set 2 keyboard, SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad, PC Speaker
The only problems I have are:
* The DVD-Rom will not read any kind of DVD (data or video) and sticking in a DVD makes drive disappear till PC is restarted. Audio CDs play fine but may not always mount on desktop. Data CDs read and mount fine.
* The media control keys on the front and across the back of the keyboard do not work. Keyboard works fine.
* The TV-Out on the video card does not work (produces garbage on the TV screen). This problem was also occuring when I had Windows XP installed before switching to Ubuntu. The only time I knew of this feature to work on mine was with Windows 2000 and the video card driver from Gateway (driver is ONLY for Windows 2000).
* I have not tested the digital audio output.
