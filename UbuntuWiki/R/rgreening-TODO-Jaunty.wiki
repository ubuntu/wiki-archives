=== My TODO List ===

** Restriced Install
*** We will look at porting Konqueror's automatic flash install patch from KDE 3 but only do the work if it is not difficult since it complements the above. [COMPLETED]
** Display setup tool
*** tseliot (Alberto Milone) is working on a new display setup tool using a python back end and GTK and KDE front ends. Work with him to ensure the KDE front end is complete and well tested.
*** this appears to be on hold at the moment with higher priority items and may not make it into Jaunty (as per discussion with tseliot Jan 6/9).
** Firewall
*** provide a KDE UI for ufw. 
*** We will put this onto the DVD but not the default CD install.
*** [On hold. Karmic target now]

** Work with upstream developer, Richard (hughsie on #packagekit) to develop/enable Add/Remove programs in KPackageKit
** Draft spec here:  http://cgit.freedesktop.org/packagekit/plain/docs/app-install-v1.draft
** Will likely need FFE on kpackagekit, packagekit and app-install-data to pull in the necessary bits
** FE piece for kpackagekit is mostly there. With the draft spec things will have to change to support it better (i.e. proper xdg lookup and the new app filter)
