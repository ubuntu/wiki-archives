__TOC__


When a Ubuntu release reaches "end of life" it will receive no further maintenance updates, not
even critical security upgrades. It is '''highly recommended''' to upgrade to a recent version of 
Ubuntu at this point. Please check the <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/upgrade|upgrade instructions]]</nowiki> for more details.

For standard Ubuntu releases before 13.04, the ''main'' component is maintained for 18 months by Canonical and the Ubuntu community.  From 13.04 onward, the support duration is 9 months. During that time, there will be security fixes and other critical updates.

For LTS (long term support) releases before 12.04, server packages are maintained for five years, desktop packages are supported for three years,
and other packages in the ''main'' component are supported for 18 months.  For 12.04 and later, both desktop and server packages are supported for five years.

The `ubuntu-security-status` command will print the exact status of your system.
