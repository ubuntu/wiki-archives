=== About Me ===
I first tried Linux when I was in school, I replaced my Windows installation with Red Hat. That was in around 2004 and I was a newbie to Linux world back then. My journey to Linux world became interesting when I tried ArchLinux, it taught me lot of things. I'm a Qt Ambassador and a huge fan of Symbian and N9, when I came to know about Ubuntu Touch, I was pleased to see that it's using technologies that I love and so decided to contribute to Ubuntu Touch and make it awesome!
