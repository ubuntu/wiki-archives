== Update 2021 ==

With the PPU application in 2014 going smoothly, I'd now like to (re)apply for the following privs

* <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-sru-developers|SRU dev]]</nowiki> (my main interest has been LTS polishing for quite a while)
* <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MOTU|MOTU]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-bugcontrol|bugcontrol]]</nowiki> re-apply, I used to be a member for the last decade or so

I'm here to be able to contribute to Ubuntu, not fill out a wiki page or follow a bureaucratic regime. I hope you understand.

Things that I worked on:

* <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/davfs2/+bug/1883025|segfault bug in focal umount.davfs2]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/wmctrl/+bug/1797287|example of an easy fix to make Ubuntu more polished]]</nowiki>, lingering in LP forever
* <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/squid-deb-proxy/+bug/1505670|5+ years, tested patch available, lingering]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nautilus/+bug/1754069|fix regression in nautilus and bring back old behaviour]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gammu/+bug/1874554|bug in leaf package gammu]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libsignon-glib/+bug/1916250|bug that I ran into when upgrading groovy to hirsute]]</nowiki>, reported, debdiff and bugfixed package provided via PPA
* <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~r0lf/+archive/ubuntu/stable|My LTS PPA]]</nowiki> with odd bits and pieces
* <nowiki>[[https://udd.debian.org/cgi-bin/ubuntu-sponsorships.cgi?render=html&sponsor_search=name&sponsoree=*leggewie*&sponsoree_search=name|sponsored packages]]</nowiki>

== Update 2014 ==
Here is my application page from 2010. <nowiki>[[https://irclogs.ubuntu.com/2010/05/04/%23ubuntu-meeting.html#t21:22|My application was rejected because I do too much for Ubuntu]]</nowiki> and even back then had been contributing for too long already.  <nowiki>[[https://irclogs.ubuntu.com/2010/05/04/%23ubuntu-meeting.html#t21:34|WTF]]</nowiki>?  I kid you not.  You can imagine this didn't really raise my motivation especially since I had to awake at 3AM in the morning and wait for two hours for this joke of a process to finish. Some people have recently nudged me to have another stab at it, so here it is, but don't expect me to put much effort into it (the application process, not the actual work, I am still very active both in Ubuntu and as DM in Debian).  This paragraph is the only addition I will make to this page.  If you want me in Ubuntu officially, then just let me in.  It took four years for the anger from the previous screw-up and alienation to subside.  I am not going to beg again.  I am here to kindly and humbly ask for privileges to PPU some of the packages I maintain in Debian.

My name is Rolf Leggewie, born in Germany, 37 years old.  Throughout my history of using computers, I've used FOSS software a great bit.  My needs and demands for a software seemed to be at odds with the mainstream more often than not.  FOSS software allowed me to get things done that I otherwise couldn't have achieved.  I had my first stints with Linux around 1998, RedHat at that time.  I believe it was around 2004 when I fully switched my main computer to Debian after dual-booting for a while.  I did grow a bit frustrated at fiddling with my computer a bit too much rather than simply using it and therefore made the jump to Ubuntu towards the end of 2005 IIRC.

=== Contributions ===

I've been a long-time contributor to a number of FOSS projects.  The most prominent ones being Ubuntu and Openembedded.  I usually do bug work.  During the last two years or so, I've also picked up a bit of packaging, starting with preparing a few patches first, then adopting a couple of packages in Debian and lastly becoming an official Debian Maintainer with upload right to my own packages.  I don't really use Debian anymore these days, but I feel the best way to contribute packaging work to Ubuntu is by packaging for Debian.  I guess the Debian folks won't mind ;-)  When I can I prepare patches for bugs I encounter myself or via the bug work in LP.  There's a number of uploads to Ubuntu that have my name in it.  I try to work with upstream when I understand that Ubuntu is not in a position to fix a problem and backpush the fix.

* <nowiki>[[http://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=foss@rolf.leggewie.biz|packages I (co)maintain in Debian]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/~r0lf|My LP bug page]]</nowiki>
* <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~r0lf/+related-software|my Ubuntu uploads]]</nowiki> (some uploaders would remove my name and stick in theirs, grr!)

=== Areas of current and future interest ===

* general bug triage
* Ubuntu in Japan
* LTS support after release (my main machine stays on LTS)

The last point is the main reason I now apply for MOTU. It's not so much about uploading but about gaining the necessary privs in LP to drive forward SRUs all the way until handover to the ubuntu-sru team.  Right now, that is more painful for me than it has to be.

=== Application for membership ===

I understand this is an application, but I don't feel at ease to brag about my bragging rights ;-)  I don't routinely hang out in IRC or go to meetups and I try to make my uploads in Debian, so maybe not too many people have personal experience with me over an extended period of time.

My launchpad karma has been consistently in the higher 4-digit range ever since Karma was introduced on Launchpad.  <nowiki>[[https://bugs.launchpad.net/~r0lf|My LP bug page]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[http://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=foss@rolf.leggewie.biz|the list of packages I maintain in Debian]]</nowiki> may also be of interest for you.
