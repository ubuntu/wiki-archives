Hi

I am Pragyansh Chaturvedi (you can also call me Raikou). I am a member of the Canonical Ubuntu Foundations team. I am a part of the Architectures squad.
I work with Dave Jones, and our work is focused on Ubuntu on the Raspberry Pi (along with the distro work that Ubuntu Foundations is involved in).
