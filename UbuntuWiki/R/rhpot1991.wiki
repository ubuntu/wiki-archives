==== Mario Limonciello (superm1) ====
Shortly after losing our original ubottu bot in our IRC channels, John wrote us a new bot to help users, blurt out bug numbers, and help moderate our channels.  We've all become so accustomed to it now, it's hard to imagine how the channels were ran before.  He's also started a subcommunity of users surrounded upon a set of tools that he continues to add new layers to the stack for managing recordings on different devices.  In the process he has learned a lot about packaging, SRU's, and lot of complex topics that are involved with being the author and maintainer of a package.  For all of these sustained contributions, +1
