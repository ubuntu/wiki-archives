=== Articles ===
I regulary publish some articles, mainly in French. The most important (national or international paper publication, 500 words or more ) are :

** "Windows vs. Linux battle continues", Tunis Hebdo. Comparison between HardyHeron and Vista. 
** "Piracy is detrimental to the open source and benefits Microsoft"!: (In Tunisia, we can buy an illegal copy of windows for 1$ so the people don't take the time to think about OpenSource => people become addicted to windows => they will pay for the license soon or later) + slight criticism of Piracy in Tunisia.
** "Software Freedom Day 2008". Published in Tunis Hebdo
** "OpenOffice.org 3, time to earn MS office's price". Tunis Hebdo
** many others..

=== Ubuntu-tn ===
I led the team to be approved : When discussing the how a loco gets CDs, I knew that the team had to be approved. Since that, I began the work to build the approval application with <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-tn/2008-May/000468.html|a first mail on Mai 16, 2008]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-tn/2008-May/000483.html|a second one two days later]]</nowiki> calling to collect all the informations. As I only got a few responses, I had to question, <nowiki>[[http://lh5.ggpht.com/Nizar.Kerkeni/SHJ3YqS4mtI/AAAAAAAAAOI/rqAFFDZDrUQ/s512/ubuntu-tn-26.jpg|pen in hand as on this photo]]</nowiki>, the presents to  the physical meeting of <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-tn/2008-July/000678.html|July 6th 2008]]</nowiki> one by one to finally <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-tn/2008-July/000669.html|fill up]]</nowiki> the approval application and submit it to the LoCoCouncil. The Team was approved on July 22.

In the team, I was the person who work on keeping the Ubuntu spirit and guiding the members to the existent resources about the community as on <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-tn/2008-July/000919.html|this mail]]</nowiki>.
