Subiect: Switch to structured translation mode

Hi,

Can you please change the translation model for your project from open to structured ?

I am the coordinator of Romanian Ubuntu translation and I saw wrong translations for Romanian in the upstream translation for your project.

By using the open model everybody can add translations and there is no way to assure translation quality.

By using the structured mode, and for example assigning translations to Ubuntu Translation team, everybody can add suggestions but only members of a translation team can check, fix and validate the translations.

Members of Ubuntu localization qa teams are knowledgable translators working toward assuring quality in Ubuntu translation and upstream projects.

At the following link you can see a list with other project or distributions using Ubuntu Translators:

Many thanks!
