* UDS BOF/Post Mortem
** [skaet] Rework release process pages to make explicit who/role, where and when; and apply refactoring (merging pages, checklist, etc. to make timeline not require back/forth linking). - TO DO
** [release team] Need to schedule in advance who's on engineer and management tasks for each milestone in natty.  - IN PROGRESS - see: ReleaseTaskSignup - need Alpha 2, and 10.04.2 signed up.
** [skaet] drive a discussion to resolve disconnect between what we're calling rc vs. a beta 2.  Should we do a beta 2 weeks before, or rc and be strict about it? How many bugs tested post RC? Publish policy statement.  Possibly adjust RC milestone to work around easter for Natty. - IN PROGRESS 
* 2010/11/19
** [skaet/JamieBennett] - discuss where Linaro Natty Freeze milestone should be logged and visible - TO DO

** [robbiew] get burndown charts into uniform format - ?
** [skaet/ScottK] brainstorm with others on ways to help tackling the large number of linking failures backlog - IN PROGRESS

** [dbarth] update on open bugs from agenda - DONE
