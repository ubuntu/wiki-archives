==== Ubuntu Bangladesh ====

I founded the Ubuntu Bangladesh local community team and worked as the team contact for 4 years (April 2006 - July 2010).

While active with the team, I used to:

* Administer ubuntu-bd.org and ubuntu.linux.org.bd
* Take care of the Ubuntu-BD mailing list
* Help users on our forum and IRC channel #ubuntu-bd and #bangladesh
* Keep a liaison with the educational institutions, IT firms, NGOs, multi-national companies as well as with newspapers and magazines
* Ran the official Bangladeshi release mirror of for 2 months in 2007 (had to be closed down due to lack of sponsor)
* Burned and distributed at least 2000 Ubuntu, Kubuntu and Edubuntu CDs and DVDs for free
