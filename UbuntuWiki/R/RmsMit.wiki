Email: 
I have been a computer enthusiast for a long time. Since my working roll became heavily UNIX orientated in 2004 I have become Interested in Linux and more specificly Ubuntu. I am learning fast and Keen to helpout. Unfortunatly time limitation have held me back the last 2 years ( learning curve on Linux, new job, new house, new marriage).
