== Introduction ==
My name is Ryan Gyger, I am a person who loves to help out wherever possible, and I love Ubuntu for the simple fact that I can help free people from the world of proprietary software. I also love it because it makes my life so much easier. I am still a bit of a noob, despite the fact that I have been tinkering with Ubuntu for a year or so. I am currently a member of the Missouri LoCo Team.

== Interests ==
I am interested in learning everything that I can about Ubuntu and how to improve it. I don't, as of yet, have a primary field of interest, per se... but I am willing to get my hands dirty in anything.
