I live in Cambridge, ON (Galt),  I have been using Linux for the past three or so years.  Having only lived in Cambridge for the last two years, I am glad to find both a LUG and other Ubuntu users in the area.  Looking forward to meeting other members in this area.

If we keep up, we can have the most users in Canada. :)
