Ravi Bal, from Markham, Ontario, Canada.  

I'm very new to Ubuntu (installed Feb 1/07), but have tried various Linux distros off and on for the last 2+ years.  Mostly, I went back to Windows for the lack of software support under Linux.  Now, I'm making a consious effort to go Ubuntu only, and try life without Windows.  So far...so good!
