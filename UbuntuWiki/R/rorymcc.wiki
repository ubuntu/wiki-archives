__TOC__


I'm the current Point of Contact for the Ubuntu Irish Team (an approved !LoCo). I've been using Linux and Ubuntu for a few years. I've been involved with Ubuntu-ie for a while. I've also helped spread Ubuntu around the world with Camara, by teaching basic IT and Linux in Africa.

I'm a coder and programmer at heart. I've been programming for years. Recently I've discovered the joy of teaching people how to use computers and how that can make all of us better.

I know if I'm stuck in an area, I can rely on Rory to help, he's helpful on IRC and encourages everyone to take part in their own way.He volunteers to help within the community and help promote Ubuntu here in Ireland. +1 <nowiki>[[czajkowski]]</nowiki>

* with regard to the Ubuntu member application, i can confirm that Rory !McCann has been a valued member of Camaras volunteer program and has contributed immensely to our committment to education in Africa through his extensive knowledge of the Ubuntu Linux OS. Rory started as a regular volunteer in our refurbishment centre helping other volunteers test and prep refurbished computers to be shipped to schools in Africa. After his first overseas placement in Ethiopia & Kenya in 2006, Rory recommended a customised version of Ubuntu that he built himslef and guided our charity in terms of service provision, documentation and delivery of this operating system (Camaraubuntu) which includes the educational software and office applications that meet the requirements of the schools curriculums and also a wide variety of applications and programs to aid knowledge generation and communication. Eoghan Crosby, Technical Director, Camara, eoghan@camara.ie

* I met Rory at the recent Ubuntu-ie Karmic Koala Ubuntu 9:10 release party.  It was my first interaction with the Ubuntu-ie LoCo team. Rory was most welcoming and made me feel like I was amongst friends straight away.  Rory took the time to ensure I was included in the conversations that were taking place and I left at the end of the evening delighted I had taken the step to attend.  Since then I have seen how active Rory is in the Irish LoCo Community.  Michael O'Donohue, Ubuntu end user. 
 
* Rory is a a really approachable guy and always available to have a chat. I have no doubt that he will be a fantastic loco point of contact for years to come. He is the definition of the kind of people we want to have representing our community. <nowiki>[[shanepatrickfagan]]</nowiki>

* Rory has done a great job as Point of Contact of the Irish LoCo and a heart-warming work spreading technological development with Free software in Africa. He is a valuable member of the community, and trully deserves membership to continue his efforts. Rory is awesome, but don't tell him I've told you all this or he will invite me to a pint of Guinness in the next Ubuntu-ie meetup! <nowiki>[[LuisdeBethencourt]]</nowiki>

* Rory's a great guy who helped me out a lot when I turned up to my first bug jam. He's been very good at getting discussion going at the Irish LoCo meetups and events online, especially since taking on the role of Point of Contact. He's been a great organiser to date and I'm really looking forward to working with Rory at more Ubuntu-ie events over the next year! <nowiki>[[declanmg|Declan McGrath]]</nowiki>

* Rory has been part of the Irish LoCo as long as I can remember. He's always there to help new and experienced Ubuntu users. Rory is always one of the first ones to volunteer for some additional tasks within the Irish Team and is not afraid of challenges. Here's Rory mentoring the first ever Bug Jam in Ireland -> <nowiki>[[http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3306/3299947088_456e1553e5.jpg|picture1]]</nowiki> and here -> <nowiki>[[http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3395/3299129303_a85e43c5a3.jpg|picture2]]</nowiki> Naturally, he was the top candidate to take over the role of the LoCo Point of Contact and we're all glad he has accepted! <nowiki>[[mdanielski|Maciej Danielski]]</nowiki>
