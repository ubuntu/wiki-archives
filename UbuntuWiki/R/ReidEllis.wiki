Email: 
Harald pointed Linux out to me when it was around version 0.12, but I didn't try it myself until Red Hat 4 or so.

I've proceeded through Red Hat, Mandrake, Fedora, and now Ubuntu. What's next? Maybe a distribution hat embraces the advanced UI made possible by Xgl?

These days I am working on contract at <nowiki>[[http://autodesk.com|Autodesk]]</nowiki>.
