=== New Meeting Format - Experiment ===

For the remainder of the release we'll be using the new forma of an open forum question and answer session for the weekly release meeting. 

To make this efficient for everyone (and hopefully reduce confusion), would appreciate it if everyone tried to follow these conventions.

* At '''start of meeting''',  please wave or say hi so we know you're present and paying attention.

* Once the topic, becomes '''Question and Answer Session''', 
** When you have a new question to ask, or thread of conversation to start off, please raise your hand "o/"
** If your just asking a follow up question/commenting on the current open question - just type.
** When possible, please target your questions to specific individuals by using their nick.   Others should feel free to comment if they have information to add to the discussion.  
** When you've finished your comments on the current question/discussion topic,  please use the convention ".." so we know you're done, and we can move on to the next queue'd up question (as indicated by a 'o/').

I'll try to call on folks in the order I see "o/"s showing up after the Q&A session starts.   

Once there are no more "o/"'s in the queue,  we'll end the meeting, there won't be an any other business topic, etc.

Suggestions on improving the above conventions are most welcome.
