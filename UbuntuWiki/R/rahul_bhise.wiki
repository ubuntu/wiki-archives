__TOC__

after reading at many places that linux is better than windows. i started to look for linux and found many of them(destro)it was very hard to find a good one. i decided to go with ubuntu.because lots of review sayed that it has very good forum and help document and it is based on deben which has long history. also update after every 6 months sounded very attractive.
