My name is Thomas W. and I'm from Austria. Very long time I thought Microsoft Windows is the PC. Untill I remembered my youth. There was Amiga, Commodore and so many other OS. 
I've startet some investigations and surprise, surprise there where a many others.
I've tried a lot of distris, and my journey stopped when I discovered Ubuntu.

Now I try to translate some Apps and work on Ubuntu eee.
