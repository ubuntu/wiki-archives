About Me:

I don't think I could apply for membership. I previously created this page for applying for membership. But seeing other people who applied for membership have greater contribution than mine I think I contributed only a small portion to ubuntu. I am also not well recognized in community. So I decided to do more contribution and become a well known contributor in the community. Beside this I am not always active because of my studies and busy life. So If you have permission to delete pages then please delete this page.
Sorry for any inconvience if any occured due to me..

Regards,
