=== About Me ===

I am a 18 year old computer freak from South Carolina. I have been here all of my life. I was first introduced to computers by my uncle. Which he taught me mostly everything that he knew (My uncle was a computer engineer). I know all about Microsoft's Scam. I have been through DOS, Windows 3.1 through Windows Vista. Which now I hate; I hate Microsoft to the point where I think that it is a sin. Also, I taught myself C/C++, but I know a little about the others too. I now have committed myself to Ubuntu. I have been using Ubuntu for a good bit of time (about 2 or so years). I started using Ubuntu, just right after Dapper Drake was released. But when I tried Fedora, I didn't like it at all. Also tried Knoppix, I also didn't like it either. So I went back to Ubuntu. This was around the time of Edgy. When I Got Beryl working for the first time, everything worked for a while. That is until all the stuff that was on my gnome panel got messed up. So I tried to fix it, but failed. So I switched over to Kubuntu, and I have been using it ever since. But here recently I have switched back to Ubuntu (GNOME).

=== Plans ===
I have been helping Ubuntu of SC for quiet a while, but recently the team leader of Ubuntu of SC has stepped down. Thus, I was voted to take his place and I gladly accepted it. I have helped quiet a lot in the #ubuntu support channel. Ever since I started college, I have been spreading Ubuntu Love, and I plan on continuing to do so.

=== Testimonials ===

Jesse, a.k.a Flare183, is an asset to <nowiki>[[SouthCarolinaTeam|LoCo South Carolina]]</nowiki>. He has grown so much over the past 2 years during which I have had the pleasure to know him. He is constantly active in our team -- always jumping for something to do. He's always helping whoever drops by #ubuntu-us-sc (and I've heard other channels as well); even when everyone else is idle - he's there. He's always eagerly awaiting the next project, or coming up with one, and helps see it through. I appreciate everything he does and continues to do. - CraigHuffstetler (xq)
