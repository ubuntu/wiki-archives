__TOC__

Happy Ubuntu user since 6.06, interested in usability, localization, and occasionally enjoying coding bits of Java / Python.
I also listen to / compose / perform a lot of music, and am especially interested in the UbuntuStudio project.

See http://ronan.jouchet.fr and http://www.flyingmolehill.com for more. See ya.
