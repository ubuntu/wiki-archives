==== Quality Assurance ====
  
** what is the status of the regression automation infrastructure? 

** Current SRU status:
*** http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/sru/latest.html

** Questions:
*** This report still looks like its being run, can it be updated to reflect the current releases? see: http://people.ubuntu.com/~sbeattie/sru_todo.html
*** is there a report that details the regression run report for the current SRU kernel update? ''[pedro] will take an action to provide next time ''
*** what has changed in terms of the bug validation over the last week for the current SRU proposed packages?
*** how many packages moved from proposed to updates/security in last week?

==== Hardware Certification ====

** what is the status of the hardware certification infrastructure automation?

** Current SRU status:
*** is there a report that illustrates the results of the last cerification run?  ( is http://people.canonical.com/~fader/hw-testing/current.html still in use ) - ''[victorp] see http://people.canonical.com/~cr3/hw-testing/lucid-proposed.html, was request to add architectures, and extend to releases ''

* [victorp]  look at adding hardware cert reports with architectures as one of the pieces of info tracked for SRU meeting
* [pedro, marjo] - look at adding regression test report as one of the pieces of info tracked for SRU meeting.
* [victorp, pedro, bjf, skaet] to set date for next target SRU release.   We'll be skipping Dec. 2.
* [skaet, victorp, bjf, pitti] - meet to discuss SRU release of maverick post hardware cert testing results
* [skaet] publish meeting conventions and discuss pre-work expectations with individual leads, so we can get this a little more efficient.
