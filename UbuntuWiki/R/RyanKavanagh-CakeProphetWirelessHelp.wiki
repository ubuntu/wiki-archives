Hey,
Don't worry, it takes some work to get set up, but it's worth it, and then runs very smoothly afterwards...
So, to set up kubuntu with your wireless card... (you might want to print or copy these instructions down). Note, these are mainly compilations of conversations and things I've found on the web, so it might not work... 

=== Steps ===

1. Boot into kubuntu. 

2. Open konsole (KMenu -> System -> Konsole)

3. Run the command "sudo apt-cdrom add"

4. Run the command "sudo apt-get install ndiswrapper-utils-1.8"

5. Follow https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/Ndiswrapper/edgy

6. Any questions, reboot into windows, look and ask on http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=136 ... or harrass someone on #kubuntu :)

7. I will be back around 16h00EST (Toronto/NY time) on Monday & Tuesday, feel free to poke me then.

Once you get internet setup, I will then be able to VNC/KRDC into your comp, and show you step by step how to set up some stuff, how to install apps... a basic crash course...
