__TOC__

Hi!  My name is Eddie Hübinette and I'm new here on LP.

The reason to why I'm here is to contribute to the community in the ways I can.
I haven't got to know Triaging that well yet, so I have no special category of interest yet.

I live in Sandviken, Sweden and that means I'm on GMT+1.
The time I can spend on Triaging will be depending on my studies etc, but a few hours a week will not be a problem.

You can reach me through:
* IRC. When I'm at home you can reach me on freenode as the user m0ar. Usually on ##linux, #ubuntu, #ubuntu+1 and #ubuntu-bugs.
* Mail. Feel free to send a message to e.hubinette@gmail.com
* My launchpad-page; https://launchpad.net/~e-hubinette

Yours sincerely,
Eddie Hübinette
