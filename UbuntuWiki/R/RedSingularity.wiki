=== About Me ===

My real name is Tim.  I live on Long Island in New York.  For years i have been into computing in some way or another, switching to linux from XP.  I have been a pure linux user for about 4 years now and i have enjoyed every moment of it!  Ubuntu is my distro of choice and always will be.  I am a part-time computer science major at Farmingdale State University, working full-time with a company as a Computer Tech.  I enjoy spending down time working on my computers and helping people where i can, both online and in person.
