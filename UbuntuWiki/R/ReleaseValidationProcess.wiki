To be carried out by: Ubuntu QA Team Lead

=== Goals ===
* Ensure that all ISOs are suitable for release
* This process should apply to betas, <nowiki>[[ReleaseCandidate|ReleaseCandidates]]</nowiki>, final releases, and milestones

=== T minus 14 days ===

1. Prepare the release test plan
** Review feature goals targeted for this release which should be covered by validation testing
** Review critical bugs which should be verified
** Review installation test cases with Evan Dandrea
** Review upgrade test cases with Michael Vogt
** Identify set of locales which are sufficiently well supported to be tested
# Remind the Canonical distro team to update <nowiki>[[https://wiki.canonical.com/StaffHardware|StaffHardware]]</nowiki>
# Issue call for community testers
** Commitment to be present and responsive during specific times when candidates will be built
** Requirement for broadband
** Reminder to download ISOs in advance, so that rsyncing the candidate is fast
** List of hardware which needs better representation
** When volunteering, need to provide:
** Email address
** IRC nick
** Hardware platforms
** Languages

=== T minus 7 days ===

# Should now have a complete list of test cases and testers
# Populate and prioritize <nowiki>[[https://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/|test tracker]]</nowiki> with all test cases and assign testers
# Notify testers via email of their assigned test cases and request confirmation of their ability to carry them out
** Include instructions for carrying out the tests
** Installation profile
** Language
** Hardware
** Include instructions for reporting bugs which should be considered for targeting
** Must respond within 3 days or test cases should be reassigned

=== T minus 4 days ===

1. Review confirmations and reassign test cases as necessary

Upon notification from release manager of the availability of a candidate build:

# Establish which test cases must be covered for this build, based on test coverage of previous builds and impact of changes made since
# Set current milestone in the tracker and ensure that the candidate builds are listed
# Notify testers on IRC of the candidate, remind of their assigned test cases and request acknowledgement
# Reassign any test cases for testers who do not acknowledge
# Monitor test reports and bug references, notifying the release manager of bugs as they are reported
** Release manager will identify showstoppers and decide whether to roll a new candidate

=== Tracking test results ===

# Post candidate ISOs and test cases in the tracker
# Announce start of test cycle
** <nowiki>[[http://www.ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=201|ISO testing forum]]</nowiki>
** <nowiki>[[http://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-devel|ubuntu-devel]]</nowiki>
** tracker mass email feature (not yet implemented)
** IRC
1. Monitor tracker results
** Ensure that bugs are filed in Launchpad by testers for genuine problems
1. Proceed with testing until validation criteria are met
** For minimal validation (alphas): at least one successful installation per ISO is sufficient
** For full validation (beta, RC, final): all test cases must be successful
# Discuss test results with the release manager, providing details on test coverage 
# Update https://wiki.ubuntu.com/{ReleaseName}/TechnicalOverview/{Milestone}/Testers (ex: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QuantalQuetzal/TechnicalOverview/Beta1/Testers) with the list of testers for the release
# Continue to collect feedback on the build after it is blessed
