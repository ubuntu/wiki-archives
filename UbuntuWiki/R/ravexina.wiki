=== Contributions ===

* My main activity in past years was helping people with their problems in:

** Q/A websites like AskUbuntu and unix stackexchange.
** Iranian Ubuntu community forum.

* Occasionally I try to create new pages or make the existing one better at Iranian Ubuntu WiKi. Here are some of the pages that I started:

** Debootstrap, FSArchiver, Docker, sudo, Repositories, libvirt, virsh, Ventoy, Kazam, ufw, SafeEyes, etc (Including lots of edits and fixes on already existence pages).

* I had different free workshops about Ubuntu and Free Software in different Universities that I have studied in.

* To spread Ubuntu, I had held three conferences about Ubuntu and free software. Two mainly focused on Ubuntu and one about Big data and Unix tools in general at University of Science and culture, Tehran/Iran.
** Of course with the help of volunteers and some members of Iranian Ubuntu Community.
** Thanks to the university support, we were able to distributed free Ubuntu disks between people.

* I have helped a lot of peoples in person. Turned them into using Ubuntu and free software in general. Helped them with their problems. Installed and configure Ubuntu on a lot of systems.

I will do my best to keep up the good work. To help people as much as it is possible for me and to try and help people to figure out their problems. 

You can invite me to talk about Ubuntu or Free Software. To tech your crew and get them up and running with Ubuntu and GNU/Linux in general.
