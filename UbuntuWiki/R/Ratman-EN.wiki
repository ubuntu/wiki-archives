I'm from Montevideo, Uruguay. I speak Spanish and English (technical). I work as a system administrator and developer mainly with python and java. For some time now I've been helping with the diffusion of free software, participating and helping in any event or activity that I could. Now I am lucky to be part of the Ubuntu Community Council Uruguay, from which I hope to be helpful and keep learning and sharing.
