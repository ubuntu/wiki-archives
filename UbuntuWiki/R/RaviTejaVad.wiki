=== About Me ===
Hi, I am a big Ubuntu enthusiast but have never contributed to it. So in order to change that I have joined Ubuntu community. I am currently pursuing Masters in Electrical Engineering at Arizona State University. 

=== Life Goals ===
*** To have every school use and teach Ubuntu.
*** I want Ubuntu to be the most stable and widely used and accepted OS.
