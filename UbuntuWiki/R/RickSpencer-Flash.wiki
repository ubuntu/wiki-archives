== What is Flash? ==
Flash is an application written for Ubuntu Phones, Tablets, and Desktops that replaces physical flashcards with virtual flashcards. You can create and edit new flashcards inside the application, and you can import from text files.

If you want to get the code, log a bug, ask a question, request a feature, propose a change, fix a bug, etc... please visit the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/flashcard-app-for-touch|Flash project on Launchpad.net]]</nowiki>
== How to learn ==
Flash comes with a sample set of cards. We will use these to demonstrate learning a set. 
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| Start by clicking on the card set you want to learn.
| <nowiki>[[File:default.png

|-
| This will bring you to the review page for the set. If you want to, you can review the cards before you try to memorize them. When you are ready, click the run button at the top.
| <nowiki>[[File:review1.png

|-
| In the run dialog, you will be presented with the front of the first card. Try to say or think what is on the back of the card. Then click on the card to flip it.
| <nowiki>[[File:run1.png

|-
| Once on the back of the card, you can click "Incorrect" if you got it wrong or did not know it, or you can click "Correct" if you knew it. This will advance you to the next card and will remove the card from the stack.
| <nowiki>[[File:run2.png

|-
| Continue trying the cards until there are none left in the stack. Then click "Done".

|-
| If you go back to the main page, you can see that you have earned stars for this set. As you near 100% of getting them right, you will get up to 5 stars.

== How to import cards ==
You can create text documents for flash cards and import them into Flash. In this way, you can create sets of cards on your desktop computer and easily move them to a phone or tablet. 

It's simple to create your text document. Each line of the document represents a card. The text for the front of the card and the text for the back of the card are separated with a colon. For example 3 cards can be defined in a file like this:

1+1:2<<BR>>
2+2:4<<BR>>
3+3:6<<BR>>

Flash will use the name of the file for the default name of the card set, though you can easily change the name of the set later.

Note that you need to install the File Manager application on your phone or tablet first.
