=== Meeting Format ===
 
To make this meeting efficient for everyone (and hopefully reduce confusion), would appreciate it if everyone tried to follow these conventions.

* At '''start of meeting''',  please wave or say hi so we know you're present and paying attention.

* Once the topic, becomes '''Question and Answer Session''', 
** When you have a new question to ask, or thread of conversation to start off, please raise your hand "o/"
** If your just asking a follow up question/commenting on the current open question - just type.
** When possible, please target your questions to specific individuals by using their nick.   Others should feel free to comment if they have information to add to the discussion.  
** When you've finished your comments on the current question/discussion topic,  please use the convention ".." so we know you're done, and we can move on to the next queue'd up question (as indicated by a 'o/').

I'll try to call on folks in the order I see "o/"s showing up after the Q&C session starts.   

Once there are no more "o/"'s in the queue,  we'll end the meeting, there won't be an any other business topic, etc.

Suggestions on improving the above conventions are most welcome.
