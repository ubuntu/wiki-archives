__TOC__

== RyanThiessen ==

I am a currently underemployed coder/sysadmin living in downtown Vancouver BC.

I've not contributed much to Ubuntu directly, but I have submitted a fair number of bug reports and have written a number of Ubuntu reviews and other articles that have been published on distronews, kuro5hin, osnews, and other places.

http://ryanthiessen.com is my personal site of mostly photos and a weblog where I talk about Gnome and Ubuntu and other things that interest me.
