=== About Robin Catling (RobinC@Amethyst) ===
Freelance project manager; writer; performer; sports coach; eccentric.<<BR>>

Sometime project manager and erstwhile independent IT consultant (hence the company handle derived from '''Amethyst Developments'''), a difficult and deviant career in IT began with American Express some 20 years ago, progressing through the travel industry with IBM, First Choice, Thompson TUI and British Airways. More financial-sector mis-management followed with MGM Assurance and the UK Pensions Regulator. 

Part-time Linux dabbler from Slackware 6 and the Mandrake Club, now a full-time Ubuntu user since Hardy Heron. Never a developer, but always a Linux evangelist, pushing all things 'Buntu from Lucid, to Mint to Lubuntu and back.
