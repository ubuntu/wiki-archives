=== Intro ===
I began using Ubuntu probably somewhere in 2006.  I had heard some buddies talking about linux systems and singing their praises, so I figured I should give it a look.  I had done some research online as to which distro would be suitable for me.  Ubuntu seemed to fit the part:  made to be user-friendly while staying on the cutting edge.  From that point, I downloaded an .iso of Dapper Drake and set up a dual-boot system on my machine.  It's been a great learning experience ever since.

Right away I was struck by how vast and helpful the Ubuntu community was (and still is), and I knew that I'd stay a fan.  I have since tried to use whatever knowledge I've been able to pick up over the years and pass it along to others in need of help.  I currently have some flavor of *Ubuntu installed on almost every machine I own in one way or another.

==== About Me ====
I was born and raised outside of Cleveland, Ohio (US).  Outside of my Ubuntu life, I am also a musician.  I play several instruments including the trombone (hence "!SlidingHorn"), bass, and I sing as well.  I currently have a band in which I do all three - although not simultaneously.  Sorry to disappoint.  Outside of that, I'm a die hard fan of the Cleveland Browns and Cavs, but I'll be the first to admit that I'm more of a bandwagon fan when it comes to the Indians.  I also enjoy a good documentary, politics, and the proverbial "hanging out with the guys."

=== Ubuntu Participation ===
When I first started using Ubuntu, I realized that in order for the community to be as strong as it is, not only should the users go there when they need help, but also to see when they can offer assistance.  Keeping that in mind, I try to spend whatever time I can in promoting and providing support for Ubuntu in whatever ways I can find.

==== Ubuntu Ohio LoCo Team ====
In May of 2010, I became a member of Ubuntu's OhioTeam.  Although I have not yet been able to make it to a !LoCo meeting in person, I stay up to date in the IRC channel, through the mailing list, and in the !OhioTeam's forum.  I also look forward to joining them in September to promote Ubuntu at the Ohio Linux Festival in Columbus in September.

==== IRC ====
I spend a very large amount of time chatting on IRC, and assuming my nick is not altered (I use ZNC and have a different nick when I'm not online), you can catch me by typing my name in a channel I'm in.:

====== Ubuntu Channels ======
* #ubuntu <<BR>>
* #ubuntu+1 <<BR>>
* #ubuntu-discuss <<BR>>
* #ubuntu-offtopic <<BR>>
* #ubuntustudio <<BR>>
* #ubuntu-us-oh <<BR>>

====== Other Channels ======
* #debian (OFTC)
* #debian-next (OFTC)
* #debian-offtopic (OFTC)

==== Ubuntu Forums ====
As you can see from my profile listed above, I joined the <nowiki>[[http://ubuntuforums.org|Ubuntu Forums]]</nowiki> in 2008.  When I'm there, I spend a lot of time in the Absolute Beginner Talk, General Help, Desktop Environments, Installation & Upgrades, and Server Platforms sections.  Most of the help I am able to provide is in the first 3 of those.  With the rest, I'm usually there to learn.

==== Ubuntu Wiki & Community Docs ====
A few years ago, I started my attempts to contribute to the community documentation and the Ubuntu wiki when I can.  Aside from minor grammatical/spelling edits, some of the pages I have contributed to are:

 {*} <nowiki>[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Last.fm|Last.fm]]</nowiki> (Outdated)<<BR>>
 {*} <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BionicBeaver/ReleaseNotes/UbuntuStudio|Ubuntu Studio - Bionic Beaver (18.04) Release Notes]]</nowiki><<BR>>

=== Seeking Memberships ===
==== Beginners Team ====
As we were all beginners at one time, we should realize that it's not always easy to make the transition to a new operating system.  I have taken the step of joining the IRC channels and creating my first wiki page ever in order to give the members of the BeginnersTeam an idea of who I am and how I may be able to contribute.

===== Target Focus Groups =====
* IRC <<BR>>
* Wiki <<BR>>

==== Ubuntu Forums Unanswered Posts Team ====
I am interested in joining the UnansweredPostsTeam, as I feel it's important that people are made aware that their problems are seen and cared about.  I know from my experiences within other communities how discouraging it can be when it seems no one can possibly help you, or that no one simply cares to do so.  To be sure that new users are as impressed with the community as I was when I first started using Ubuntu, I am making a conscious effort to regularly check the forums for any unanswered posts to which I may be able to contribute.

==== Ubuntu Studio ====
As a musician, gamer, and streamer, I have a particular interest in multimedia and related software, etc.  As such, I intend to use whatever skill and knowledge I can to help with the revival, development, and future releases of the Ubuntu Studio flavor.  Currently, I am a member of the ubuntustudio-www team, and I eventually plan on helping in terms of debugging and packaging for the project.

==== Ubuntu Membership ====
I understand at this point, I'm going to need to crawl before I walk.  However, I would like to become a full-fledged Ubuntu member at some point in the not-too-distant future.
