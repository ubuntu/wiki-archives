=== Team Updates ===

==== Release Overview ====

===== Q/R release planning input =====

** Summary community feedback on release date options at end of cycle.
*** Feature Freeze date more relevant than release date for most development, but some upstreams align with our cycle and make bug fix releases after FF.
*** End of the month better for likely KDE upstream schedule, for bug fix releases.
*** Halloween gets +2 for being home, no votes for being at UDS that week.
*** Week before Thanksgiving gets -2, and a "doesn't really matter".
*** Noted that it's helpful that the schedule in the past has varied every year, so we don't always inconvenience the same people, or overlap with the same country's holidays.
*** In IRC from meeting,  cjwatson noted its best to avoid end of month due to charges for downloads at release time.   Daviey noted that Open Stack Developer Summit wants to be informed of our dates so they can synch up. 

===== status.ubuntu.com =====
  
** http://status.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-oneiric/ is up and available
*** Currently getting the configs tweaked and tuned.
*** Information on how to set up topics can be found at: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/TopicHowTo.
*** If you have questions about the site or setting up a topic, please ping skaet, cjohnston, or wendar on Freenode IRC

==== Quality Assurance ====

** Features
*** <nowiki>[[http://status.ubuntu.com/oneiric/canonical-platform-qa.html|Oneiric Work Items]]</nowiki>

** weekly testing status:
*** <nowiki>[[http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/qadashboard/qadashboard.html|QA Dashboard]]</nowiki>
*** The QA team has been sprinting hard all week long to setup the new QA Lab. We've made very good progress and started migrating Jenkins and the automated ISO testing to this platform.

** On the Oneiric defect side,
*** 176 bugs have been reported this week against Oneiric.
*** A little bit less than 50% (86 bugs) have been triaged. The backlog is growing very fast but this must be mitigated by the fact that:
#### Many of them are crash reports (87 reports / 49.4%)
#### The retracers have been enabled last wednesday
#### There are many duplicates to clean up.
#### Most of the crashes affect desktop packages.

*** Amongst those 86 triaged/fixed issues, 20 have a high importance and 2 are critical.
**** The 2 critical bugs are fixed:
***** bug 797281      LP API broken in oneiric with python-httplib2 0.7.0-1
***** bug 796865      Kernel 3.0 broke libparted

**** 13 High importance bugs are still opened amongst which 4 are lightdm issues. 
***** '''lightdm''' is the package with the most bug opened during the last week.  The status of these 11 new bugs is:
****** 2 closed (fix or invalid)
****** 3 opened (incomplete, in progress, triaged, confirmed)
****** 6 are new
***** According to the importance of lightdm component (Key feature of 11.10 and very visible part of the desktop) there are 2 comments:
****** The triaging effort on this component must be reinforced.
****** A weekly release of this component is not enough, and updates should be pushed more frequently at this stage of the development to ensure that the bugs reported are not already fixed in the dev branch (Looking at the commits it seems that many of the issues reported are fixed upstream already, so the QA view based on lp bugs might be biased)

*** Migration to linux 3.0
**** 2 main issues were reported and fixed.
***** bug 796611 nfs-utils: kernel version handling leads to segv on short versions (x.y)
***** bug 796865 Kernel 3.0 broke libparted

** Areas of Concern:
*** <nowiki>[[http://qa.ubuntuwire.org/ftbfs/|Failures to Build]]</nowiki> - 40 main packages (up from 31).  '''*needs some focus*'''
*** <nowiki>[[http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches.txt|Archive Component Mismatches]]</nowiki>

** updated to the GCC Linaro 4.6-06 release

** Doko request: it would be nice to address status of merges both for main and universe in the meeting, same for component mismatches.

==== MOTU ====

* Release Status 
** Failures to build from source: http://udd.debian.org/cgi-bin/ubuntu_ftbfs.cgi

== Highlights ==

** Teams are focusing primarily on features (as expected),  but bugs milestoned for A2 are getting on the radar. 
** Images are breaking and being fixed daily right now (partitioning, dpkg/multiarch, etc.) 
** Failed to build from sources are clogging up release bugs and need to be scrubbed/cleaned up.

** Key project details:
*** Linaro gcc toolchain landed (gcc 4.6-2011-06),  eglibc 2.14 being evaluated.
*** Gnome 3.1.x starting to land and new X.org version landed.
*** CD space situation is still pretty tight,  ongoing investigations, more at Rally.
*** unity SRUs for natty have landed,  and now started integrating new features into Oneiric builds.  (unity-2d, unity-gl, overlay scrollbars, new sound API, enhancements to multitouch) 
*** Xubuntu trying to cut down on gnome dependencies (Xfce will stay at GTK2)
*** Good progress overall for server team towards features,  but MIRS from Open Stack may become problematic.

== ACTIONS ==

** seems to be a disconnect between the Ubuntu One plans and desktop expectations, and SRU team expectations.   This needs to be investigated further [pitti, Chipaca, wendar]
** determine best interval for full archive rebuild tests with new compiler and broadcast [slangasek, doko]
** discuss concerns over default to have composite on in metacity for unity-2d, it breaks a lot of apps that use fake transparency (i.e. gksudo has a black background instead of a transparent one) [ogra_, dbarth, Kaleo]
** clean up trend lines for server team status burn downs [Daviey, skaet?]
