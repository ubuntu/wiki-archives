__TOC__

== Security Review of Request Tracker ==

http://www.jadevine.org.uk/request-tracker/

=== General impression ===

* HUUUUGE (ca. 200.000 LOC)
* completely written in Perl
* code runs as www-data by default, so can potentially compromise all apache instances; can manually be configured to use apache's suexec, or a standalone server (/usr/bin/rt-standalone_httpd-3.4) though (depends on how many other apps apache servers in addition)

=== Security history ===

* 0 CANs
* one XSS in old version in 2003 (http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/rt/announce/72, http://secunia.com/product/1542)

-> excellent

=== Installation ===

* A bit clumsy since db user initially must have CREATEDB privs; however, can be revoked after rt-setup-database
* Hangs with apache-worker (my default module), works with -prefork.

=== Source code ===

I could not review the whole source code, so I looked at some crucial
points to get a general impression.

* general: does not use taint mode
* general: no unsafe exec/system calls
* EmailParser.pm: correct temp file handling
* bin/rt.in (CLI client): looks good, uncritical
* bin/mason_handler.fcgi.in: ok
* XSS attempt failed, Mason properly escapes HTML meta characters automatically
* encapsulates DB access over DBIx::SearchBuilder, which properly escapes quotes (I checked this)
