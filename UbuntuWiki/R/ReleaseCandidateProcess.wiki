__TOC__

To be carried out by the <nowiki>[[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-release|Ubuntu release team]]</nowiki>

Goals:
* Produce a comprehensive, thoroughly tested release intended for final publication
* Execute a complete functional test of the release process in preparation for the final release

RC minus 14 days:

# Notify kernel team of KernelFreeze
# Prepare the release announcement and formal $RELEASE/ReleaseNotes
** Notify leads for Kubuntu, Edubuntu, Xubuntu, Ubuntu-Studio, Lubuntu, Mythbuntu inputs
** Review `-changes` mailing list since the last milestone to make sure that all relevant major changes have been documented in the milestone's web page
** update the page to include any caveats
** request that contributors to Release Notes provide links to upstream project web pages and change logs in their entries, where appropriate. 
** notify loco teams to translate release notes (coordinate with Matthew Nuzum; URLs should be https://wiki.ubuntu.com/<releasenotepath>/<lang> for all languages)
** obtain up-to-date list of triggered release mirrors from Canonical sysadmin
** Notify `ubuntu-doc@lists.ubuntu.com` to proofread the announcement and suggest changes, CC product owners (from ReleaseManifest) and Marketing.

RC minus 10 days:

1. Notify developers by mailing <nowiki>[[http://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-devel-announce|ubuntu-devel-announce]]</nowiki>:
** Pointer to milestone page
** Reminder of freeze
** Reminder for integrating all translations listed in NonLanguagePackTranslationDeadline to packages. DavidPlanella can help with exporting the translations from Launchpad to facilitate the work.
** Target any relevant bugs to the milestone
1. Review problems and file targeted bugs for those which need resolution for the release candidate:
** PackageInconsistencies
** Live filesystem build failures
** Upgrade failures
** Oversized ISOs
# Update metapackages for all derivatives
# Notify Michael Vogt to perform a GnomeAppInstallDesktopDatabaseUpdate
# Notify James Troup to remind mirrors to check free disk space
** Include estimate of disk space requirements for pre-publishing the release candidate
1. Begin UpgradeTestingProcess

RC minus 7 days (Final Freeze):

1. All CD-related problems should be resolved
** PackageInconsistencies
** Live filesystem build failures
** Clear the <nowiki>[[http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-archive/NBS|NBS]]</nowiki> list.
# Announce the freeze on the `#ubuntu-devel` topic and <nowiki>[[http://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-devel-announce|ubuntu-devel-announce]]</nowiki>. There is generally no need to tell people to hold off on uploads, as they will be held automatically by Soyuz once the next task is performed.
# Set the distrorelease status to `FROZEN` in Launchpad
# Review problems and file targeted bugs for those which need resolution for the release:
** Installation bugs
** Upgrade bugs
** High-severity bugs
1. Selectively accept package uploads to resolve targeted bugs

RC minus 3 days:

# Stop all live filesystem and cdimage cron jobs
# Modify `debian-cd/CONF.sh` to set `OFFICIAL="Release Candidate"` (Edit from bzr co bzr+ssh://nusakan.canonical.com/srv/cdimage.ubuntu.com/bzr/debian-cd/ and pull from /srv/cdimage.ubuntu.com/debian-cd on nusakan)
# Ensure that the ISO tracker lists the new milestone, marked as "automatically publish"
# Go through ReleaseChecklist
# Produce a full set of images
# Notify QA team (Jean-Baptiste Lallement) to begin ReleaseValidationProcess
# Notify Cert team (Ara Pulido) and ask for re-certification on test hardware
# Iteratively test and accept select showstopper fixes
# Ask the marketing team (ubuntu-marketing@lists.ubuntu.com) to prepare a web page about the changes since the last milestone.
# Notify web team (ellen.arnold@canonical.com, IRC: ellen) to ensure that the release notes redirection table on `http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes` is up to date

RC minus 2 days:

# Receive certification test results from Ara Pulido
# Review targeted bugs and take final decisions on what to fix and what to defer

Night before release:

1. Pre-publish ISOs (for CDs only): `./publish-image-set --prepublish` (from <nowiki>[[https://code.launchpad.net/+branch/ubuntu-archive-tools|lp:ubuntu-archive-tools]]</nowiki>) will print the necessary commands.

RC minus 15 minutes:

# Copy the beta release from releases.ubuntu.com, by moving all `*-beta-*` in .pool directories under `/srv/cdimage.ubuntu.com/www/simple` to directories under `/srv/cdimage.ubuntu.com/old-images/`.  If requested by IS, also remove these files after archival; note that this will leave releases.ubuntu.com without any visible images for this release for a short while.
# Publish the CD images: `./publish-image-set` will print the necessary commands.
** You need to edit `cdimage/www/simple/HEADER.html` and `cdimage/www/simple/.htaccess` by hand to change "Beta" to "Release Candidate", since neither publish-release nor publish-image-set is yet smart enough to do the right thing there.
# Copy .manifest to .manifest.full, pruning all images from previous releases from the .manifest file to allow timely mirror probing.
# Remove any not-yet-official warnings from the announcement and release notes
# Verify that all mirrors listed in the announcement or release notes have images, and remove faulty mirrors
# Check torrents for proper functionality

RC release:

# Update the topic on `#ubuntu-devel`
# Notify the web team (ellen.arnold@canonical.com, IRC: ellen) to put the announcement on the website
** News sidebar
** `/testing`
# Send the release announcement to `ubuntu-announce`
# Post an announcement on http://release-blog.ubuntu.com/
# Post announcement to Launchpad (ubuntu-drivers members have posting rights)

RC plus 1 day:

# Continue on ReleaseProcess
# If any changes were made to this document in this run, check whether the changes also apply to MilestoneProcess, BetaProcess or ReleaseProcess.
