== About Me ==
Ryan Stonecipher-Fisher is a proponent of free software in educational and professional environments.  He has encouraged professors at <nowiki>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Institute_of_Technology|Georgia Tech]]</nowiki> to teach LaTeX syntax instead of using MS Word with strange formatting.  As an engineer, his interests are in the design and testing of more sustainable power production using technologies which harness the energy in light, wind, and water as alternatives to burning fuels that output carbon oxides.  Ryan uses the alias of ToHellWithGA on FreeNode IRC and can be reached by memo there most days.
