__TOC__

== Agenda ==

* Actions from previous meetings
** cr3 to ensure that the QA team collects and processes feedback about the filebug redirect change
** cr3, marjo to follow through on netbooks missing from the hw certification lab
** davmor2 to work with ttx on creating a test plan for eucalyptus
** pitti to ensure that we have test plans/release notes for all specs
** lool to ask humanity upstream to prepare a colour revert for bug #430277 ('''Update Below''')
** Design team requested that we try to include the work from latest Humanity upstream tree which consists of:
*** updated notification area icons, darker, so that they display nicely on the desktop
*** new Humanity-Dark theme which is Humanity with lighter black and white notification area icons to display nicely under UNR
   If we want this (release team and desktop team should decide too), Loic plans to put the new theme in the same binary package and update the UNR gconf settings in desktop-switcher and unr-default-settings.  This is still tracked in LP #430277.  The Humanity-Dark theme should "Inherit:" the Humanity theme so the new icons should make a minor difference in binary package size / CD size.
** slangasek to get linux-ec2 into main for beta ('''Done''')
** zul to get new ec2-init sorted today
** smoser to test vmbuilder patch to use germinate ('''Done''')
