== Community Process Feedback ==

Recently we have been making efforts into better improving the method and approach in which our community can report issues and how we resolve them. Currently this process involves users being able to file issues in bug reports that our governance bodies have access to. You can see the process <nowiki>[[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ReportingCommunityProblems|here]]</nowiki>.

This page is designed to gather feedback around this process and how we can improve it.
