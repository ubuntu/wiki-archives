== Community Bug Handling Best Practice ==

The purpose of this page is to build a set of best practices around how we handle community process and infrastructure bugs. You can read about the process in which a community problem is reported <nowiki>[[ReportingCommunityProblems|here]]</nowiki>.

Our goal with this process is have a means in which our community can file a problem, we can have an open and frank discussion about the issue, work together on a solution and have an effective method of agreeing on the solution (something which the governance bodies tasked with these bugs have the remit to do).
