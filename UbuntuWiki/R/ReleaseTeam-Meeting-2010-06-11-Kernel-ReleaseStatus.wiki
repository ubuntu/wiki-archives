=== Release Meeting Items ===
==== Current ====
===== Bugs =====
* LP:591707 - After upgrade lucid -> maverick eth0 interface is gone
** Tim is currently assigned to and investigating this bug.  The issue has been tested and confirmed against the latest 2.6.35-rc2 kernel as well.  Tim has contacted the upstream e1000e Intel developers.  The current suggestion from them was updating the BIOS to see if this helps.  Still awaiting feedback from bug reporter.

===== Specs =====
* UbuntuSpec:kernel-maverick-apparmor (jjohansen)
** Started cross testing of compatibility patch and found some errors that need to fixed before it can be pulled in.  Will try to get that cleaned up so we can pull in the latest version, and send it upstream. Caching patch fix - no progress still sitting on the back burner behind cold, compatibility patch, and EC2.
* UbuntuSpec:kernel-maverick-config-review (ogasawara)
** All Maverick kernel config changes have been reviewed, applied, and uploaded.  We'll send a final kernel content and configuration report to ubuntu-devel around Maverick-Beta.
* UbuntuSpec:kernel-maverick-firewire-stack (manjo)
** Kernel config options are enabled already to build both old and new stack.  Manjo is still investigating enabling the new stack in userspace.
* UbuntuSpec:kernel-maverick-misc (apw)
** This is our catchall blueprint to track work items which don't warrant an individual spec but still represent a task needing attention.  The only remaining tasks for Alpha2 are is debian abstraction work for Karmic and Maverick and also reviewing our Karmic netbook branch.  Neither task is critical for the Alpha2 release.
* UbuntuSpec:kernel-maverick-new-kernel-on-lts (tgardner)
** The Lucid LTS backport kernel is tracking Maverick at http://ppa.launchpad.net/kernel-ppa/ppa/ubuntu.  The current kernel and meta versions are linux-maverick-2.6.35-1.1~lucid1 and linux-meta-lts-backport-maverick-2.6.35.1.6.
* UbuntuSpec:kernel-maverick-pv-ops-ec2-kernel (jjohansen)
** pv-ops kernel has so far not been working out, and jj is following up with Amazon.  Started looking at fallback plan 1 of pv-on-HVM driver but jj hasn't been able to successfully build them yet (failing in the ballon driver atm).  Need to test building them on an older stock kernel yet.
* UbuntuSpec:kernel-maverick-ubuntu-delta-review (ogasawara)
** Currently reviewing a handful of Ubuntu SAUCE patches we're carrying.  Received confirmation we can drop 2 and we'll attempt to push 3 more upstream.
* UbuntuSpec:kernel-maverick-union-mounts (apw)
** Waiting on testing from Foundations from updated kernels.  As part of the roll forward to v2.6.35-rc1 we have had to update AUFS2 as it no longer built.  We expect to have to update it again before v2.6.35 final regardless of whether union-mounts make it.
* UbuntuSpec:kernel-maverick-upstart (apw)
** We have patches pending for the remaining Alpha-1 deliverable, waiting on testing from Foundations.  We have also pulled forward the 'readahead was used' patches from Lucid testing to Maverick and pushed those to a further PPA for testing.

=== Items Pushed out from Alpha-1 ===

* kernel-maverick-upstart: look at passing all used and unused kernel command line options to userspace
** this still requires testing, it also makes most sense to push this into the kernel just after a milestone.  Moving to early Alpha-2.
* kernel-maverick-union-mounts: push union-mount tools to PPA
* kernel-maverick-union-mounts: evaluate union-mount as a replacement for AUFS
** both of these still require testing.  Moving to Alpha-2.
* kernel-maverick-new-kernels-on-lts: Investigate MIR process for this package:TODO
* kernel-maverick-new-kernels-on-lts: interlock with QA to set support levels:TODO
** both of these are long term goals and more sensible achieved before Beta-1.
* desktop-maverick-xorg-in-mm: review the i8xx patch
* desktop-maverick-xorg-in-mm: produce a PPA for the i8xx patch to allow testing
** there is currently much discussion over the patch and it is still evolving, waiting till the patch settles.  Moved to Alpha-2
