=== Actions Pending ===

* UDS BOF/Post Mortem
** [skaet] Rework release process pages to make explicit who/role, where and when; and apply refactoring (merging pages, checklist, etc. to make timeline not require back/forth linking). - TO DO
* 2010/12/10
** [skaet/ScottK] brainstorm with others on ways to help tackling the large number of linking failures backlog - IN PROGRESS
** [skaet] figure out a way of calling attention to wishlist bugs(per: http://www.uk.debian.org/Bugs/Developer#severities), that are actually feature dependencies between teams  (bug:56679, bug: 688142) - IN PROGRESS.  Probably will need to have discussions at next UDS though for resolution. 
* 2010/01/07
** [JamieBennett] test build qt4-x11 with the volatile int fixed before it is landed - DONE
* 2010/01/14
