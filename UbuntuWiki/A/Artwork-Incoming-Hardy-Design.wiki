== Hardy Design ==
For the Long Term Support cycle starting with Hardy Heron we are planning a top-down change of themeing and artwork. Information on the color palette, design concepts, rules and examples can be found below.

==== Palette ====
In order to stay consistent with the stock Gnome icons we are including the Tango palette as well as adding a few handpicked vibrant colors and design specific colors. The colors shown below are only temporary. We need to adjust these ideas to create a final palette.

==== Concepts ====

Orange on black is the general definition of what we want to achieve. The look can vary from modern to organic. The main idea is to create something which represents glass in a dark room being lit from below with a yellow light creating a gradient from light orange to  a deeper red color. The picture in the top left of the example pic best visually defines this idea. 

==== Examples ====
