 04:10 <toddc> SLUG just sent out a nice email to it's members recommending the installfest and posting all the detail

 04:10 <toddc> Someone asked a question on team procedures, so Wmack and I started a small review of them and found some minor issues. We would like any input  or ideas

 04:11 <toddc> RC voting allows no way to verify votes I.E. several chat Id's family friends. This could sway a voteing session.

 04:11 <toddc> IRC voting

 04:11 <toddc> Several Ideas are to move voting to https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-arizona this would mean to vote you would need a launchpad account and join the team. This would  be simular to being a us citizen to vote

 04:12 <toddc> we are also looking at adding the ubuntu code of conduct http://www.ubuntu.com/about/about-ubuntu/conduct witch can be signed at your launchpad account

 04:12 <toddc> after that we can look at offices procedures
