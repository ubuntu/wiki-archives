== Stand Tall ==

I´m submitting content for Ubuntu for the first time and i must say, it´s a great feeling. The wallpaper style has been widely used on Ubuntu, but i wanted to add some words that would reflect what we all 'ubuntu-ers' feel when we talk about this amazing OS. Hopefully this new version will even get more people on the world of Ubuntu. Thanks for viewing!
