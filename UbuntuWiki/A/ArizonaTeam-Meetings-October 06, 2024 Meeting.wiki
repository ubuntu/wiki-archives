 04:10 <toddc> See any administrator for access to the blogs and any that should be moved to the front page let us know about it.

 04:10 <toddc> LINUX QUOTES/JOKES

 04:11 <toddc> How do penguins break through sea ice ?

 04:11 <toddc> Boot in Gnome first.

 04:11 <toddc> Why will Gnome launch from a shell ?

 04:11 <toddc> It can't reach up to the balcony.

 04:11 <toddc> The first time I read that a daemon might be the reason for some minor problem I was having, my first thought was,

 04:12 <toddc> "Omygosh! My computer needs an exorcism!?"

 04:12 <toddc> And my second thought was,

 04:12 <toddc> What is a Ferengi starship commander doing in my 'puter?"

 04:12 <toddc> Why did the sysadmin cross the road?

 04:13 <toddc> To get to the Chroot Jail.

 04:13 <toddc> What did Linux say when asked to go out for a date?

 04:13 <toddc> A. I'd love to, but I have to go-on-a-line.
