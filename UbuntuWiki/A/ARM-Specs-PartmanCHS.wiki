=== Summary ===

Provide the necessary recipes and supporting infrastruction to allow partman to construct VFAT partitions matching those built in existing ARM images.

=== Release Note ===

Starting with Ubuntu 11.10, product managers may choose to provide alternate or netinstall images for ARM hardware relying on VFAT boot partitions constructed such that MLO is the first file in the filesystem.

=== Rationale ===

Some ARM hardware requires a specially-constructed FAT partition from which uboot can boot.  partman has no understanding of this construction, such that it is not possible to use debian-installer to completely configure a bootable system.  This prevents the use of alternate or netinstall images.

=== User stories ===

=== Assumptions ===

=== Design ===

You can have subsections that better describe specific parts of the issue.

=== Implementation ===

This section should describe a plan of action (the "how") to implement the changes discussed. Could include subsections like:

==== UI Changes ====

Should cover changes required to the UI, or specific UI that is required to implement this

==== Code Changes ====

Code changes should include an overview of what needs to change, and in some cases even the specific details.

==== Migration ====

Include:
* data migration, if any
* redirects from old URLs to new ones, if any##(see the SpecSpec for an explanation)

* how users will be pointed to the new way of doing things, if necessary.

=== Test/Demo Plan ===

It's important that we are able to test new features, and demonstrate them to users.  Use this section to describe a short plan that anybody can follow that demonstrates the feature is working.  This can then be used during testing, and to show off after release. Please add an entry to http://testcases.qa.ubuntu.com/Coverage/NewFeatures for tracking test coverage.

This need not be added or completed until the specification is nearing beta.

=== Unresolved issues ===

* Building alternate or netinstall images using this infrastructure

=== BoF agenda and discussion ===

Use this section to take notes during the BoF; if you keep it in the approved spec, use it for summarising what was discussed and note any options that were rejected.
