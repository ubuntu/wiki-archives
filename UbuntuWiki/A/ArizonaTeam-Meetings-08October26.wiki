[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:25:50] <johnc4510-laptop>	ok, i need to check in on mom and get her to bed bb shortly
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:26:24] <azteech>	kk
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:30:15] <azteech>	john do we have any feedback about the UofA location yet?
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:32:00] <azteech>	type, do we have any of the fliers ready for final approval?
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:32:11] <azteech>	tyche I mean ...
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:32:41] <tyche>	I can't do anything more on the fliers until I get the information.  Just as soon as I do, I'll finish them up.
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:33:20] <azteech>	kk ... was hopeing to hear about that tonight since we are running short on time ...
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:35:21] <virginpidgin>	Heya Tyche?? I didn't mean to refer to the "hackfest", I meant the same function that the fliers are suppose to be for... Does that make any difference?
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:35:46] <tyche>	Nope.  And I figured that was what you were referring to.
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:36:12] <virginpidgin>	 Cool................ 8-)
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:36:31] <virginpidgin>	So, hows Paula doing?
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:36:56] <tyche>	Not bad.  Tired, and her hip is beginning to bother her more.
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:37:06] <tyche>	But still pretty game.
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:39:05] <tyche>	She didn't go on the Jamboree with my son and I.  And maybe that's just as well.  It was a lot rougher trail than she would have been led to believe.  It even bothered me in spots.
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:39:08] <virginpidgin>	I'm thinking that since we're the scared ones, if things get out of hand... We'll jump in the jeep & chase the guilty parties. You do the bumper-butt bumpin & I'll be in charge of the cattle prod!!
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:39:51] <virginpidgin>	Rite on, I'd love it if you'd tell her hello for me & that I wish her well?!
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:39:52] <tyche>	Naw, I'll just treat them as I would any speed-bump
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:39:59] <tyche>	I'll do that.
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:40:13] <virginpidgin>	lol
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:40:42] <tyche>	In fact, I just did.  She said, "thank you.  I'll have to talk to her sometime."
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:40:43] <virginpidgin>	Ya'll still had a blast though-I bet.....
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:41:17] <virginpidgin>	Absolutely.
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:41:27] <tyche>	OH, yea.  Ever trusted a relative to give you driving directions while you were blindfolded?  Hee hee
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:41:33] <tyche>	I TRUST my son.
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:41:42] <virginpidgin>	Hell Nah!
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:42:20] <virginpidgin>	That had to be a bonding/trust exercise....
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:42:54] <virginpidgin>	Well, I see you lived to tell the tale to boot!! RITE ON!!
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:42:59] <virginpidgin>	:-D
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:43:02] <tyche>	We did it.  That was one of the challenges, driving around 2 cones set out on river rock at the edge of the Rio Verde.  There wasn't even any question.  I drove, blindfolded (actually a paper bag over my head) while he gave VERY GOOD directions
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:43:43] <virginpidgin>	That's freakin Awesome.
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:44:02] <tyche>	No chance of really hitting anything, or of falling in the river.  But it still takes trust.
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:44:15] 	 * johnc4510-laptop says sorry, i'm having some problems here. I'll have to talk with everyone tomorrow.
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:44:16] <tyche>	He even acted as navigator for another man
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:44:16] Quit	johnc4510-laptop has left this server ("leaving").
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:44:22] <virginpidgin>	You bet it does!
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:44:40] <azteech>	whoops, hope it isn't his mom ...
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:45:09] <virginpidgin>	 You know what/where else that would be an awesome place to have 2 people perform the same exercise?
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:45:14] <tyche>	I agree.  I hope it isn't more problems for him.
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:45:54] <virginpidgin>	He's certainly been hangin like a pro though.
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:46:04] <tyche>	Yea, he has.
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:46:49] <azteech>	yes, he has ... and still all while leading the group to where we are today ....
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:46:57] <tyche>	Yep
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:47:05] <azteech>	someone gonna have to take up slack I suspect .. for a while ...
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:47:23] <tyche>	Do I hear a volunteer?
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:47:30] 	 * slofgren points at tyche 
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:47:34] <slofgren>	;)
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:47:40] <azteech>	2nd
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:48:04] 	 * tyche looks around for someone named "tyche"
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:48:13] <azteech>	12-to-14 hour work days makes it tough for me to do much of any coordinating ....
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:48:17] <azteech>	lol ......
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:48:30] <virginpidgin>	"I think", it'd be a test of truth/trust/bonding for a couple to go through that exercise. When its all sain & done, let it help them to see where they "really" are...
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:48:31] 	 * tyche doesn't see anyone by that name, and shrugs it off.
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:50:42] <virginpidgin>	I know thats rite tyche! OH!!! I mean-I know thats rite, "man shrugging it off"!!
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:50:43] <virginpidgin>	lol
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:51:02] <azteech>	lol ......
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:51:52] <tyche>	well, I've heard of the "Sacred Rites of Spring" (Le Sacre Du Prentemps), but never the Rites of Fall.
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:52:05] <azteech>	lol .......
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:52:26] <tyche>	Unless it's Halloween, of course.
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:52:28] <azteech>	as tyche sings "Help Me, I'm Falllllllllling" .... lol
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:53:19] <tyche>	Of course, that would be Samhain
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [21:53:46] <azteech>	lol .....
[Sun Oct 26 2008] [22:09:49] <azteech>	okay, guess meeting adjourned ...... not that is was ever called to order .... lol
