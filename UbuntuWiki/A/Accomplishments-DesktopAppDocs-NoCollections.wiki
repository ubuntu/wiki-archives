== No Collections Installed ==

'''To use Ubuntu Accomplishments you need to have at least one collection of accomplishments installed.''' 

It is recommended to install two default accomplishment collections.

* '''Ubuntu Community Accomplishments''' - A large collection of trophies that reward you for being active in the Ubuntu comunity.
* '''Ubuntu Desktop Accomplishments''' - A set of trophies that are related to Ubuntu desktop usage, and discovering Ubuntu.

If you are using the Releases PPA, you can get both these using following command:

<pre>
sudo apt-get install ubuntu-community-accomplishments ubuntu-desktop-accomplishments
</pre>
