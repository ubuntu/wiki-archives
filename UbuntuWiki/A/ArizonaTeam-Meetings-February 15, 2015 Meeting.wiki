 04:29 <markthomas> I have a project as well

 04:29 <toddc> markthomas: would you like to talk about it?

 04:29 <Tuxmann> I finished making an add on board for the Raspberry Pi that runs a python script at start up and it sends the IP address to the add on board. That then displays the IP address on a 3 digit 7 segment display.

 04:29 <markthomas> I've been asked to update the Ubuntu server guide for samba 4. Every section need reviewed, tested, and updated.

 04:30 <Tuxmann> I don't have the files on github, but I will post them there soon and the project will be open source, including the printed circuit board files.

 04:30 <markthomas> It's a community documentation project, but it's "official", so it undergoes a peer review after changes.

 04:31 <toddc> both cool projects   would a nice post on azloco.org

 04:32 <toddc> markthomas:  will that be a solo project or will you need assistance?

 04:32 <markthomas> Anyone who wants to participate in the guide, with me or on a separate section, is welcome.

 04:33 <Tuxmann> I still need to create my documentation for the project, but I would be happy to post on azloco.org as well. markthomas, sounds like a good project. I use Samba for my home server and guides are great.

 04:33 <toddc> cool that sound like a great project
