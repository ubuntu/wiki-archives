__TOC__

This page collects the specifics for running Ubuntu on a C series Beagleboard

=== Installation Images ===

Different images and installation variants are described on the following pages:

<nowiki>[[File:ScreenshotBeagleNetBook.png]]</nowiki>

<nowiki>[[ARM-BeagleNetbookInstall|BeagleNetbookInstall]]</nowiki> - Follow this link to install Ubuntu on a Beagleboard using the ubiquity installer under X. This installation needs a USB disk to load the operating system onto.

<nowiki>[[ARM-BeagleServerInstall|BeagleServerInstall]]</nowiki> - Install an Ubuntu Server system (uses the debian-installer in text mode, needs a USB disk/key to install to. See below for installation over serial console)

<nowiki>[[ARM-BeagleNetInstall|BeagleNetInstall]]</nowiki> - Install a minimal system with USB NIC attached (this installation variant is the most flexible one and also allows installation to SD card without pre-partitioning, uses debian-installer in text mode. See below for installation over serial console)

=== Enabling a Serial console and adjusting boot options ===

The debian-installer based images (server and netinstall) are capable of doing an installation over serial console.

Follow the <nowiki>[[ARM-BeagleEditBootscr|BeagleEditBootscr]]</nowiki> page to set the right bootoptions

=== Reporting Bugs, discussion with Developers ===

To make sure reported bugs are seen by the armel porters, make sure you subscribe (not assign) the ubuntu-armel team to bugs you report and also set the armel tag.

If you want to discuss the images or issues you see, join #ubuntu-arm on irc.freenode.net

=== Known issues ===

Indeed the Beagle has only 256M of RAM so if you use the Netbook image, dont expect a lot of speed, the system will likely swap.

=== Getting a serial connection ===

Connect the serial connector to the board, if you have a non-wired pin in the connector then the opposite corner is pin 1, otherwise one corner should be wired with a red wire, and in that case that is pin 1. The board should have markings indicating pin 1.

Connect this to your computer with a USB-serial connector, and you should then have a /dev/ttyUSB0 node, if not then check for /dev/ttyUSB1 etc.

Now power on the board.

If you run

<pre>
screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200
</pre>

then you should be connected to xboot on the board and can start to control it.
