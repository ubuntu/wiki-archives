__TOC__

All user and system hooks will provide a way to clean up the system/user account on uninstall of the version.

The Click packaging system will maintain a reference count for which user installed which version of a particular package.  It will also garbage collect when no user has that version of the application installed.

Old versions should not lose a reference and be uninstalled unless and after installation of the newer version succeeds.
