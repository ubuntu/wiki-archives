My name is Valentin Anastase, I'm also known as "Dread Knight" on the internet.

All my life i have used Windows, but now I've seen the light :D
I'm in love with open-source/cross-platform applications and of course, i'm a big fan of the Ubuntu OS. I want to help the community as much as i can, so i'm in the Ubuntu Romanian Translators team, also if you happen to need an Ubuntu cd and you are in Constanta, drop by :)

My take on improving Linux for the desktop is by creating a Non-Profit Organization that has it's main activity to develop free open source cross platform games that are commercial like quality.
Feel free to check our website and find more about the NPO and our current game projects we're working on:
