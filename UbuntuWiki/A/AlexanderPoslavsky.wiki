plovs/plovs_work @ #ubuntu & #ubuntu-doc

Born 1971, my first computer was a c64 although I played with my friends zx81 before that. I am an administrator, in a mixed windows/linux network. I prefer the linux part. We use Debian or windows 2000 on our servers. Fedora 1 on workstations, but when ubuntu goes stable, that will change. I have been using linux on my main computer starting with redhat 5.1 ( i had caldera before that but nobody writes that on his resume, anymore).
