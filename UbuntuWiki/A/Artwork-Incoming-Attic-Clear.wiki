== Clear ==
Clear is a project to redesign the Ubuntu desktop to set what Mark Shuttleworth considers a "Gold Standard." Our goal is to help improve the Intrepid Ibex release, then over time, have a completed desktop that will meet this standard by the next LTS, Ubuntu 10.04.

A new mock up will be coming soon. It will follow guidelines set down by the new Art Team initiative.
