== Ubuntu Jaunty Jackalope Fur ==

=== Description ===

There are always objects around us, and we should know what it is by giving it a name or a brand, and in this case a logo. It is important to determine by looking or a glance what an object mean.

=== Concept ===

The concept is simple, to place the ubuntu logo on the jackalope fur. Blender 3D is used for jackalope modelling; Gimp for fractal design and color adjustments. I got the reference image in Wikipedia.
