[Sun Apr 13 2008] [20:58:05] <johnc4510-laptop>	Tyndall is one block east of Euclid and the shop is half a block South off of University. Or about 2 and a half blocks North off of 5th Street.
[Sun Apr 13 2008] [20:58:39] <johnc4510-laptop>	you can use google map and put in the addresses for a better idea of the locations
[Sun Apr 13 2008] [20:59:03] <johnc4510-laptop>	For the Tucson release party, the sub shop will be a good place to relax and have some fun. I went there and the wifi was good and easy to connect to. Music, and the owner was nice and very accommodating. There are not a lot of plugs, but he said we could run extentions and power strips as needed.
[Sun Apr 13 2008] [20:59:19] <johnc4510-laptop>	.
[Sun Apr 13 2008] [20:59:19] <johnc4510-laptop>	..
[Sun Apr 13 2008] [20:59:35] <johnc4510-laptop>	We can order food individually, or he offered party trays. I might buy a party tray to start us off, depending on how many members are going to show up. Either way, we should patronize the place since they're being nice enough to let us use it for our get together. Of course, the same holds true for the Phoenix party at the Pizza Place. Everyone should plan on eating dinner at these places.
[Sun Apr 13 2008] [21:00:00] <johnc4510-laptop>	.
[Sun Apr 13 2008] [21:00:12] <johnc4510-laptop>	we want to show our appreciation of course :)
[Sun Apr 13 2008] [21:00:59] <johnc4510-laptop>	please remind me that i have a couple of questions for soldats when he shows up
[Sun Apr 13 2008] [21:01:10] <johnc4510-laptop>	he said around 9:30
[Sun Apr 13 2008] [21:01:22] <enigmastrat>	YAY! RAID5 is back!

[Sun Apr 13 2008] [21:02:42] <johnc4510-laptop>	or is it on until you take it off
[Sun Apr 13 2008] [21:02:47] <tyche>	No, it's set up under Events for a particular day.
