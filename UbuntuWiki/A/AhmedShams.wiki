 Hi, I'm Ahmed Shams, I love to triage bugs for Ubuntu, specially for Input Devices/xserver, review Ubuntu translations as well as helping others as long as I know what they are talking about ;). I like to go out, advocate open-source, help others to jump to our community easily and safely. Big part of my brain keeps thinking of locos and newcomers, have no idea why?, but I like this and will put some work to grow that idea.
