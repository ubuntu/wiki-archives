__TOC__

Debian developer, Ubuntu developer and all-round decent guy.  Ish.

Within Ubuntu, I currently work on general QA, buildd infrastructure, the server team, the kernel team, occasionally touch the toolchain in funny ways, and I'll overextend myself in just about any other fashion that leaps to mind when I'm in the right (wrong?) frame of mind to do so.

In Debian, I tend to do reasonably similar things, but for a little bit less pay.

If you need personal contact info, it's available to Debian developers on db.debian.org and Canonical employees in the Canonical wiki.
