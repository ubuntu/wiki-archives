__TOC__

I am currently working as an IT Consultant in Surabaya, Indonesia. I have been doing my work with Linux since 2003. Red Hat 8 was my 1st ride, and installed perfectly in my Toshiba Portege 3110CT notebook with some effort. Since then Linux  become my "Brain-by-Nature, Knowledge-by-Choice" (derive from Geek-by-Nature, Linux-by-Choice). 

Becoming interest on translating since Fedora Core 2, I was part of the team for id-translation (Indonesian).

Recent Progress :

- Translating "Tellico" support for Indonesian language.
