 04:23 <toddc> FUTURE EVENTS

 04:23 <toddc> Any thoughts on other events or projects???

 04:24 <MajB> Do you want a report on the TFUG meeting?

 04:24 <toddc> yes

 04:24 <MajB> Three of us from Sierra Vista drove up to Tucson to attend an â€œunofficialâ€ Tucson Free Unix Group meeting at Cafe Luce in Main Gate Square outside of the University of Arizona.  There were four Tucson residents there who were interested in starting physical meetings for the group.

 04:24 <MajB> We provided them with POCs for both AZLOCO and the Cochise Linux User Group in Sierra Vista and some basic information on communication between members and some requirements for holding Installation Festivals/Linux Workshops.

 04:25 <MajB> They want to meet twice a month but no one was willing to step up to be the group driver.  We recommended that that position be occupied by several people to prevent the loss of continuity if that person should lose interest, move away from the community, or otherwise absent himself.

 04:25 <MajB> We also expressed a willingness to provide assistance in the way of advice or lessons learned from the establishment and early months of the CLUG.  They have been provided with four email addresses of possible previous admins or organizers and the information on their domain name.  We will now await further activity on their part.

 04:25 <MajB> That is all for now.

 04:25 <toddc> Turbixtux is working on a radio spot that would help us get some pr locally

 04:25 <MajB> Nice

 04:26 <toddc> more as we get more info

 04:26 <MajB> We are looking at that in SV as well.

 04:26 <toddc> that is all I have anyone have anything else to bring up?

 04:26 <MajB> But the group leader has been dragging his feet.

 04:27 <toddc> me?

 04:27 <MajB> Me

 04:27 <toddc> great meeting tonight thank you MajB

 04:28 <toddc> I will be here for a while if you have any questions

 04:28 <MajB> I think we we have a TFUG member present, seanw

 04:28 <toddc> cool and welcome
