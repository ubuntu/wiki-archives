=== Computing, Open Source, Linux and Ubuntu ===
I love computer since my father bought our first PC in 1994 which runs DOS and Windows 3.1. During that time, I have an uncle who is also a computer lover. I'm inspired on how he can build his PC from usable scrap parts and even use an old TV for his monitor. But it just goes like that, nothing happens to me. In the end of 1996, I met another uncle who work as IT executive in Malaysian very own Oil & Gas Company. He told me to search for Linux and there where the story begin. During that time, I don't know anybody who uses Linux near me. And due to my limitation in money and resources, I've let it sleep in my to do list. 

On 1999, I successfully get in touch with Linux where I managed to get a Red Hat book with a free CD in it. I dual boot my Windows 98 Cyrix box to learn it. I've tried to convinced some of my friends to use Linux but after lots of crashes and problems, they get back to windows and label me as weird who use unstable operating system just because they hate the troubles they get while using Linux. I then tried other distros such as Mandrake, Slackware and Debian to find which suits me better. Being a Linux practical trainer for a vocational training center in 2003, I'm teaching my students on how to install, configure and troubleshoot Linux. In 2004, I got a job as VB & C++ Programmer where I work mostly in Microsoft Windows environment and have to leave my Linux thing aside. I learn programming from lot of tutorials and open source codes on the internet. I began to love open source as they let me learn from others code but then, I've been busy like hell with tight schedule and feel like lost contact with the outside world.

Early 2006, I jump to this company that I work now which give me new breath. I'm back with Linux and use Fedora Core 5 in my HP nx9010 laptop. In the end of 2006, I found Ubuntu while searching for a User Friendly Linux solution for a small Recruitment Company who suffer to buy original Microsoft Windows for all their computers which previously using pirated windows product due to their lack of knowledge about it. When I managed to make them happy with Ubuntu and keep supporting them in getting familiar with it, I feel like I found one great Linux distro for my friends who was Linux hater. Before I can convince them again, I convert my Fedora partition to Ubuntu.

Being Linux lover outside of a community make me move slow. I started to join <nowiki>[[MalaysianTeam|Malaysian LoCoTeam]]</nowiki> in early November 2007. I then met and hang around with <nowiki>[[fenris]]</nowiki> and others in the community where we share our visions in spreading Ubuntu awareness in Malaysia.
