Do you have an idea for an event, project, improvement, or team-related activity? Our team thrives on your ideas! Please add your ideas to the table below. To do this, add an entry to the "New Ideas" list below. As your idea is acted upon, it will move through the subsequent stages of "Under Consideration" and then "Approved" or "Deferred". Discussion about proposed ideas will take place either in the <nowiki>[[http://alabama.ubuntuforums.org/|community forum]]</nowiki>, at <nowiki>[[AlabamaTeam-Meetings|meetings]]</nowiki>, on the mailing list, or some combination of these.

* '''Idea''': Give your idea a short but descriptive name

=== Deferred Ideas ===

When an idea has been deferred, it means that it may or may not be acted upon. These ideas were likely to be determined unsuitable or unfeasible. This list is kept so that members can develop an understanding of what types of ideas are deferred. If any relevant forum discussions exist on these topics, a link can be found in the "Discussion" field.
