__TOC__

'''Who am I?'''
 Home made computer geek.

'''What do I do?'''
 Currently I work as senior developer at TransIP (<nowiki>[[https://www.transip.nl/]]</nowiki>)

'''History as Ubuntoer'''
 Have been using Ubuntu since Breezy.<<BR>>
 Have been helping newbies on IRC for some time, especially on #ubuntu-br. <<BR>>
 I was responsible for 6 servers at UEPB, all of them running Ubuntu Server. (www, mail, proxy, backup, matricula, dns)
 I convinced the people at UEPB to use Ubuntu as the default OS. Since I came there in June 2006, 2000+ new machines with Ubuntu have been installed, meaning UEPB is probably one of the largest users of Ubuntu in the northeastern region of Brazil.

'''My contribution to open source'''
* Helping out new users
* Helping with bugs
* Promoting free software
