== Ubuntu at LCA ==

<nowiki>[[http://linux.conf.au|Linux.Conf.Au]]</nowiki> is now less than a week away. Hooray!

The conference runs from the 15th to the 20th of January, and it's shaping up to be an awesome week.

Included in the <nowiki>[[http://lca2007.linux.org.au/Programme|plethora of geeky coolness]]</nowiki> are talks from the ranks of Ubuntu, such as Jono Bacon, Scott James Remnant and Robert Collins.

There is a free Open Day on Thursday the 18th of January from 3pm to 8pm, where the Ubuntu-Au team will be doing their best to spread the Ubuntu love by bribing passers by with swag bags and flashing cool demos before them.

Ubuntu-Au is also holding an unofficial, casual, late dinner at a nearby pub after the Open Day. Details of the dinner can be found in <nowiki>[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-au/2007-January/001106.html|the invitation to the mailing list]]</nowiki>.
