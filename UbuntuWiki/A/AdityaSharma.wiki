__TOC__

I have completed my Computer Science Post Grad heavily depending on Ubuntu to help me with my work, studies and entertainment and am working as a Software Engineer where the same tradition continues. 
I started using Ubuntu from  '''Ubuntu and Xubuntu 6.10''' ''Edgy'' and have used pretty much most of the versions since then on my notebooks and desktops.
