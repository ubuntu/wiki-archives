=== Agenda ===

==== Loco Forums ====
* Do we need/want a spot on ubuntuforums? This has been raised a number of times in the mailing list, so we probably need to make a decision, if only to postpone the decision -- MatthewVermeulen (MatthewV)
* A decision was made to stay away from ubuntuforums.org due to issues with the structure of the forums, and it was decided that there is currently no need for any web forums.

==== Meeting ====
* Should a meeting be held on the 1st of January 2007? (Just a thought based on New Years Eve and what happens on that night) -- Sicc 'Sexy' ness (Siccness)
* The Jan 1st meeting was cancelled and the next meeting was set to January 8th, to allow for LCA planning.
