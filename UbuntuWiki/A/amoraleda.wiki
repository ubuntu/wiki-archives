=== About me ===
Hello World! :D
I'm Álvaro Moraleda, born in Madrid in 1983. My mother tongue is Spanish (obviously), and also speak some English and German. I'm Computer Engineer by the University of Alcalá and I've been enjoying GNU/Linux since 2004 (using different distros). I discovered Ubuntu in 2006 and became my favourite OS both at work and at home.

=== Interests ===
* Free Software philosophy.
* All about learning new stuff (prog. languages, technologies...).

=== Hobbies ===
* Playing guitar (acoustic and electric).
* Rock climbing.
* Watching movies/series (v.o.s).
* Reading
