== Mockups of a proposed new MeMenu look ==

''What for?''

The current Indicator Menus in Unity are opaque, while the rest of Unity employs a blur effect beneath semi-opaque display objects. This is inconsistent and unpretty.
Here are some design-mockups which might inspire to make things look a little better in future releases of Ubuntu Unity.

MeMenu with 0 new messages, indicator outline only:

MeMenu with 2 new messages, indicator filled blue:
{{http://ubuntuone.com/7e07YfO1APxmrjjan83QKe}}

I removed the "invisible" Presence status enabler, since it doesn't make the Presence controls any better and it only occupies additional space.

There are no app-launchers in this indicator menu design, clicking a conversation will launch the respective window, which should be sufficient for the sake of launching stuff. For Contact List there is the Unity Launcher or the Dash. The purpose of this menu is to respond to or to inspect incoming messages from other humans. This is sufficiently covered by "launching" the respective conversations upon click.
