== About Me ==
Passionate supporter of the Free and Open Source Software model, the UNIX philosophy, the GNU/Linux tools and the Python way of thinking. 
Having used different Linux distributions, I tried Ubuntu at home 4 years ago and I've been faithful since then.
I am a Telecommunications Engineer with several years of balanced experience in the areas of Network Operators, Information Technology and Software Development. 

== Areas of Interest regarding Ubuntu ==
For now, I want to collaborate and learn how the Ubuntu community works.

Eventually, I could be interested to focus on projects related to:
* python
* networking
* ubuntu server
