          Hello to anyone!<<BR>>
          Please excuse my english, which I've learned alone at home. I live in Romania and I am a hungarian ethnic from this country. With this wiki I wish to be helpfull to the community (and it is the first one which I ever wrote). Thus, feel free to correct my grammatical and/or phonetical mistakes, or to adjust the content of this documentation if it is necessary.<<BR>>
          At end of this year's february (2006) I've purchased my brand new Asus A3H 5010 laptop. Of course I am an Ubuntu fan, and i was used Hoary and Breezy in earlier times on my machines (Sempron 2200+ and Dell Latitude C600. Now I use the new Dapper Drake LTS 6.06 on my "Asustopi". I like this distro, even if I've encountered some problems with it, especially in Breezy on this cute laptop. I'll describe those probs and their solutions in this wiki below.
