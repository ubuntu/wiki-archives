[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:06:21] <Spreadsheet>	they should have freedom toasters in the US

[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:11:48] 	 * tyche doesn't have a grammer
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:11:56] <johnc4510-laptop>	ok, so, any thoughts
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:11:57] <enigmastrat>	mine got removed when I was 12
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:12:06] <johnc4510-laptop>	lol
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:12:16] <enigmastrat>	sorry... I think the info looks good
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:12:27] <johnc4510-laptop>	any additions or ideas
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:12:28] <johnc4510-laptop>	?
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:12:33] <tyche>	Looks like a start, but I'd want to go over it carefully before I made any comments.
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:12:33] <kennymc0>	looks good to me
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:12:41] <johnc4510-laptop>	kk
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:12:45] <johnc4510-laptop>	good idea
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:13:07] <johnc4510-laptop>	everyone should look it over this wk, and make comments on the thread
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:14:13] <enigmastrat>	I noticed this event was held previously at UAT
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:14:27] <enigmastrat>	what was the original name again?
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:14:33] <enigmastrat>	barcamp?
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:14:36] <johnc4510-laptop>	even more so than the installfest, this event will need manpower
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:14:46] <johnc4510-laptop>	barcamp   yes
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:14:55] Quit	Spreadsheet has left this server ("ChatZilla 0.9.81 [Firefox 2.0.0.11/2007112718]").
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:15:19] <johnc4510-laptop>	i thought maybe instead of barcamp we would use open source conference
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:15:34] <enigmastrat>	ok... just for reference: http://www.barcamp.org/BarCampPhoenix
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:15:40] <johnc4510-laptop>	i thought maybe that would look a little more upscale or professional
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:15:52] <kennymc0>	probably
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:15:54] <enigmastrat>	I agree
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:17:37] <johnc4510-laptop>	enigmastrat: i had not seen that
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:17:45] <johnc4510-laptop>	i wonder who did those
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:17:53] <johnc4510-laptop>	i didn't see that it said
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:17:57] <enigmastrat>	I believe it was students from UAT
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:17:58] <johnc4510-laptop>	quick scan
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:18:00] <johnc4510-laptop>	ah
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:18:09] <enigmastrat>	anyone go there in here?
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:18:12] <johnc4510-laptop>	i saw an email addy
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:18:25] <johnc4510-laptop>	might be a good idea to contact him
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:18:28] <kennymc0>	i didnt know about it
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:18:37] <johnc4510-laptop>	see if he is interested
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:18:38] <kennymc0>	that would have been fun to go to though
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:18:50] <johnc4510-laptop>	ours should be similar
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:18:52] <johnc4510-laptop>	:)
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:19:05] <johnc4510-laptop>	looks like a good resource
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:19:13] <enigmastrat>	I went to UAT for a LAN once.  The facility is very well equipped
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:19:25] <johnc4510-laptop>	and it was held in 06 and 07
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:19:31] <johnc4510-laptop>	ah
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:19:39] <enigmastrat>	so maybe join forces and bring more people to the event
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:19:44] <tyche>	I wonder if we could get the use of the facilities
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:19:45] <johnc4510-laptop>	agreed
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:20:16] <kennymc0>	yeah it looks like i wont be able to get room at devry with how much they are tearing up with the construction
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:20:37] <johnc4510-laptop>	google phoenix was a food sponsor for that
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:20:48] <johnc4510-laptop>	kennymc0: kk
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:21:15] <tyche>	I think that we definitely don't want to take the name barcamp away from them.
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:21:30] <johnc4510-laptop>	no
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:21:30] <johnc4510-laptop>	but
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:21:45] <johnc4510-laptop>	we either want to include them in ours, or
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:21:52] <johnc4510-laptop>	include us in theirs
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:22:04] <tyche>	Yep.  One way or the other.
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:22:06] <johnc4510-laptop>	if they have one going for 08
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:22:13] <tyche>	Yep
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:22:40] <johnc4510-laptop>	they had it in dec
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:22:50] <johnc4510-laptop>	seems an odd time of yr to have it
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:22:51] <johnc4510-laptop>	?
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:23:06] <tyche>	We'll just have to talk to them and see what they say.
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:23:16] <johnc4510-laptop>	yep
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:23:21] <tyche>	it may have been to avoid various school problems.
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:23:39] <johnc4510-laptop>	i'll look over that info and email them, i think i saw an addy on one of the pages
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:23:47] <johnc4510-laptop>	maybe
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:23:51] <tyche>	Sounds good.
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:24:08] <johnc4510-laptop>	ok, so
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:24:14] <johnc4510-laptop>	it's a start
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:24:19] <kennymc0>	yep
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:24:24] <johnc4510-laptop>	everyone look over the wiki page
[Sun Feb 17 2008] [21:24:32] <johnc4510-laptop>	and leave comments on the thread
