=== Installation instructions for manual installation of the development version of the Ubuntu Accomplishments Source ===

These instructions may be useful in case you cannot use the PPA for some reason. This may be useful for later Ubuntu versions, or other distros.

Note that following these instructions will install you the '''latest development version''' of Ubuntu Accomplishments. That version is not guaranteed to be stable, so you may want to re-install it from time to time (and you are highly recommended to do so, as otherwise you are not getting updates with bug fixes). For future releases we may consider publishing stable archives to reduce this issue.

'''Due to python distutils's limitations, automatic uninstallation of the daemon and the viewer is not possible.''' You would need to manually remove all the files installed. However, you can safely install a new version of accomplishments over an older one. (This can be solved using custom --prefix when installing)

==== Preparation ====

You will need Bazaar (bzr) for fetching the source.

You will need DistUtils (python-distutils-extra) to install the accomplishments system.

Start in some temporary directory, as this process will download a few branches to there.

==== Installing the daemon ====

<pre>
bzr checkout lp:ubuntu-accomplishments-daemon
cd ubuntu-accomplishments-daemon
sudo python setup.py install
cd ../
</pre>

==== Installing the viewer ====

<pre>
bzr checkout lp:ubuntu-accomplishments-viewer
cd ubuntu-accomplishments-viewer
sudo python setup.py install
cd ../
</pre>

==== Installing the default Accomplishments Collections ====

You can install other collections if you wish. These two are just the official ones.

<pre>
bzr checkout lp:ubuntu-community-accomplishments
bzr checkout lp:ubuntu-desktop-accomplishments
cd ubuntu-community-accomplishments
sudo sh install.sh /usr/share/accomplishments
cd ../ubuntu-desktop-accomplishments
sudo sh install.sh /usr/share/accomplishments
cd ../
</pre>

==== Starting the Accomplishments System ====

If you want to start the daemon only use `accomplishments-daemon`. If you want to launch the viewer (it launches the daemon automatically) use `accomplishments-viewer`, or find it in your Applications menu (depending on your distro).
