21:02 < UncleSam> Welcome to the Ubuntu Arizona LoCo Team Meeting
21:02 < johnc4510> any new folks
21:02 < johnc4510> ?
21:02 < johnc4510> ok
21:02 < johnc4510> announcements
21:03 < johnc4510> gutsy gibbon beta will be out this wk
21:03 < johnc4510> Gutsy Release Parties
21:03 < johnc4510> this is the main part of our meeting tonight
21:03 < johnc4510> Date: 10/18/07 
21:04 < johnc4510> time to be determined
21:04 < johnc4510> but in the evening 
21:04 < johnc4510> ok
21:04 < johnc4510> locations
21:04 < johnc4510> Tucson and Phoenix
21:04 < johnc4510> now
21:05 < johnc4510> we would prefer free wifi places 
21:05 < johnc4510> and food or the ability to bring in our own food
21:05 < johnc4510> ideas?
21:05 < johnc4510> for places
21:06 < johnc4510> ok, 
21:06 < rsthree> i rightly wonder where we'd be allowed to bring food
21:07 < johnc4510> we can check bookman's   but we think they might be unavailable
21:07 < johnc4510> you can at bookman's
21:07 < johnc4510> and probably most coffee shop's if you ask ahead
21:07 < johnc4510> or
21:08 < johnc4510> we could go without the wifi and just meet at a pizza place or something
21:08 < johnc4510> we could have some gutsy discs burn
21:08 < johnc4510> burn'd ahead of time
21:08 < rsthree> excellent
21:09 < johnc4510> ok, lets skip place for now
21:09 < johnc4510> organizers
21:09 < johnc4510> i can do the tucson event with a little help
21:09 < johnc4510> so, we need someone in phoenix
21:10 < johnc4510> jsonder: would you be able to come up to tucson for our party?

21:11 < jsonder> I'd like to meet some folks
21:11 < johnc4510> great
21:11 < johnc4510> organizing would only be reserving the place pretty much
21:12 < johnc4510> once we decide on where
21:12 < johnc4510> most of the other stuff i can take care of
21:12 < johnc4510> hmm, ok

21:32 < johnc4510> with spouse or dates maybe more
21:32 < word> i don't wanna go and then have to make up stuff about how much fun the 3 of us had when the tucsoners come rolling in to talk about their 30 person party w/ free merchandise and dunk tank >.>
21:32 < johnc4510> word: nothing like that
21:33 < johnc4510> tucson  probably about 8 members 
21:33 < johnc4510> with maybe a couple of spouses or dates
21:34 < jsonder> I don't think that I could twist her arm sufficiently....
21:34 < johnc4510> ah
21:34 < johnc4510> np
21:34 < yamyogurt> dates that will go over well
21:35 < word> might get awkward fast :P
21:35 < jsonder> my wife taught cs languages; she knows what to expect 
21:35 < johnc4510> :)
21:38 < word> i think we should have one big party :P
21:38 < johnc4510> well, it's ok with me, but how many phoenix people are going to drive down here on a weekday evening
21:39 < johnc4510> other than you
21:39 < johnc4510> hee hee
21:39 < word> it's my fall break, i have the whole week off ;p
21:39 < johnc4510> cool
21:40 <   jsonder> I was just viewing it as a "social" --- a chance to meet the folk behind the nicknames
21:40 < word> yah, and splitting it would be lame ;p
21:40 < tyche> I would, but I'd have to stay over night.  Must get my beauty sleep, after all.  Got to stay beautiful.  (see example:  https://launchpad.net/~tyche)
21:40 < johnc4510> i've seen it
21:40 < johnc4510> lol
21:40 < johnc4510> word: see pm
21:41 < tyche> Yea, I know.  and I ain't beautiful.  LOL
21:41 < word> tyche: i could bring you home :P
