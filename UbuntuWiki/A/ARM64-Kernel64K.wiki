=== Installing the arm64 64k kernel variant ===
Ubuntu provides a kernel variant compiled to use 64K pages. 64K kernels are available in Ubuntu 20.04 and later. For Ubuntu 20.04 ('focal'), the 64k variant is only available as an HWE kernel - Ubuntu does not ship a 64k variant of the GA kernel based on Linux 5.4. Ubuntu installers do not currently provide a way to choose the 64k kernel at install time, so you must first install your system with a 4K-page kernel, and transition to the 64k variant:

To install for Ubuntu 20.04:
  sudo apt install linux-generic-64k-hwe-20.04

To install for Ubuntu 20.10 and later:
  sudo apt install linux-generic-64k
