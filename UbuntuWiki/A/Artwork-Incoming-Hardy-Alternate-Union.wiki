== Union ==

Union is a theme crossbred between Basic Ideals and another (unnamed?) concept theme by floodcasso2. The name is derived from the fusion of the two themes.

'''' Message from the Author ''''
The 0.4 update is the last update the primary author of this theme will be able to make. If you have time, and experience with GIMP and Inkscape, please feel free to use the assets of this theme to make your own version of Union, or collaborate on this version. Others are working on getting close to the Union mockup in a live and working theme, examples can be found in the various contributed files!

So in the mean time thank you for stopping by, ''please'' enjoy the gallery.
So long, and thanks for all the fish.
 -- Ken Vermette

=== Concept ===
Currently Union is a Compositing-enabled Murinne theme based on technology by Cimi, within the Gnome GTK+ framework. Graphics are created in SVG format, as to enable scaling when the technology becomes available.

==== Goal ====

There are no GTK themes available as of yet, the theme so far is only within concept stages. The theme goals are to:
* Be extremely clean with minimal clutter; Avoid information overflow.
* Use sharp graphics and smooth gradients; Make the theme clear-cut yet gentle.
* Showcase a unique visual identity; People know Ubuntu when they see it.
* Look solid, yet lightweight; People hate flimsy feeling windows and being weighed down.
* Demonstrate the cutting edge without overstepping; Use as much technology we have, use very little we don't.
* Display the graphical prowess of Linux; Some people still think we only have command-line.

==== Feature Concepts ====

'' Below is a list of extra buttons or anything that would be considered really "new" ''

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| Versions
| Feature Description
|-
| 0.1+
| Murrine-Enabled transparency; Cimi modified the GTK and Murrine to allow windows to have complete per-pixel alpha across the entire window. Compiz can be set to blur beneath the main window as well, although this is not shown.
|-
| 0.2-0.3
| 3 buttons along the bottom with less common (but useful) actions. Each button would have both an "on" and "off" state. In order from left to right: Roll Up, Remain above other Windows, Tack/Sticky across desktops
|-
| 0.2+
| Monochrome Panel Icons, blends into the panel so persistent icons are less noticeable.
|-
| 0.4
| Gaussion Blur / Noise Spread technique, a more unique method to transparent windows.
|-
| 0.4
| 4 buttons along the bottom with less common (but useful) actions. Each button would have both an "on" and "off" state. In order from left to right: Above other Windows, Roll Up/Shade, Tack/Sticky, Expose

=== Media ===

==== Palette ====
'' Pallet images will be available at a future date. All colours used are derived from the official Ubuntu palette.''

==== Kith ====

Low-End version of Union, 2 flavors, "Framed" (bottom) and "Unified" (right). Capable of being reproduced with pixmaps in Metacity.

=== Development Assets ===

Below is a .zip file (sorry, no tar.gz) of the union development assets. It's just a huge .zip of everything here plus a couple extra images and raw files.

The Emerald, GTK and Metacity themes are very incomplete, barely modified versions of other themes. Some members of the Art Team have began work on the Union versions of the theme, and assets are very likely to show up on this wiki or Gnome-look. The exact locations are undetermined. More up-to-date files are not necessarily in this collection, as this is a snapshot of my development files before the computer they were on died.

=== Comments ===
I really like it, though I think that the colors need to be tweaked a bit.
I also noticed that this theme has the same idea as my theme unity. It might look good
if basic ideals is combined with mine. - JM55: December 25, 2007 13:09 GMT

This is certainly one of the most promising looking concepts, however, how practical is it? Could you perhaps post some mockups of some basic applications (gedit, gnome-calculator, etc.). I'm not entirely certain the window design lends itself well to windows with an "editing area" (usually white). As for feasability, I don't think I can see anything in the design that's not entirely feasible with Murrine. Although I think one or two of the window decorator features might not be possible in gtk-window-decorator. - Nick Telford: December 30, 2007 13:20 GMT

VERY, VERY NICE.  This would be great for the default theme for users with effects turned on.  Can I get permission to try and turn this into a compiz fusion theme?  No promises because I'm a little busy, but I would like to try...
[naurus - winitgator@gmail.com]

It is nice, however the orange background within applications is a bit dark for me and hard on my eyes. I think it would be better if it was a little lighter.

I think it's one of the best ideas i've seen since a long time ago. I really like it, but maybe you should take care with transparencies. [Miquel Tarazona - www.mitabe.com]

Got the first version of that compiz theme I squeaked about finished. It's here (http://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Union+Limited?content=74770) on gnome-look.org (great site!).
[naurus - winitgator@gmail.com]

This is by far my favorite theme I've seen.  I'm a big fan of the monochromatic icons in the notification area.  I have only two concerns.  How gracefully will it degrade if a person's computer doesn't support compiz/compiz-like effect?  Also, how easy will it be to allow users to choose a different color scheme and still look good? -- Mikm 
This theme has much potential. The layout etc. is great, but I think a lot needs to be done. In terms of use-ability, it is far too orangey. It looks great on the orange background! As it looks like a overlay that washes out the color. But on the alternate backgrounds the orange is almost a distraction. For this theme to really kick it off we need to create some code that observes the background image, gets the 'average' color (eg. for a background of grass, it outputs a green) and then output the palette to the theme. This would be hard, but it would definitely transform the desktop experience! I find that the theme just doesn't 'blend' enough for it to be used universally. Just my 2 cents. -- timehAndGod
