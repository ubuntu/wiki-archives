== Welcome to my wiki! ==

=== Please allow me introduce myself... ===

I'm Anselmo, a computer engeneering student at University of Campinas (UNICAMP) - Brazil. My application was accepted on Google Summer of Code 2006 and I'll (as I wrote on my <nowiki>[[http://wiki.ubuntu.com/AnselmoApplicationSoC2006|application]]</nowiki>) "develop a set of tools for Epiphany which will offer a content-control and customization features for parents and educators interested in controlling the use of the Internet of their children or students". This application was created with the help of CoreyBuger.

My experience with the Free Software world started about five years ago and I have been using GNU/Linux as my main platform since I started my studies at UNICAMP. The distribuitions I have already used are: Red Hat, Mandrake and Slackware. Nowadays, I use ArchLinux, Ubuntu and Gentoo.
