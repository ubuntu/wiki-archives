21:34< johnc4510> are going to burn the cd's ourselves
21:35< slofgren> yeah and give to who?
21:35< johnc4510> so we will have to donate the supplies
21:35< slofgren> that is easy and fine
21:35< bluecat9> johnc4510, on that note, we need a Donate Wiki page :)
21:35< johnc4510> libraries     coffee shop with free wifi
21:35< johnc4510> etc
21:35< slofgren> is there an event or just in gweneral
21:35< johnc4510> bluecat9: k
21:36< Apple> mmmm free wifi
21:36< johnc4510> so far just getting items ready to distribute
21:36< johnc4510> closer to time we will decide exactly who and where
21:36< slofgren> we shoudl offer to setup a captive portal for coffee shops that give them a chance to runs some ads for the shop and for ourselves
21:36< johnc4510> we have ideas
21:37< johnc4510> but other ideas encouraged
21:37< slofgren> ww could use the donated computers
21:37< johnc4510> ah
21:37< johnc4510> a good idea
21:37< slofgren> s/ww/we
21:37< johnc4510> I put a new thread on forum about Ubuntu Flyer's http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=494877  We've had some lookers, but no comments. Anyone have a thought about these flyers?
21:38< slofgren> what would we do with them?
