Apr 03 21:10:53 toddc The good: We got there and got setup. We had a lot of great help doing this with a  total of around twelve people helping out and setting up.
Apr 03 21:11:08 toddc The great: I had a wonderful time meeting all the /southern az members and putting faces to names and nicks. I think next time I may take photos and notes since I am bad at that area. And after the event we went to Oregano's and had a great meal.
Apr 03 21:11:23 toddc The bad: due to several large outdoor events that weekend we had poor attendance 1 install on my spare box (thanks to all those that actually did it) and one repair-install
Apr 03 21:11:45 toddc the Result is we need to plan better we had great location and support.
